[01:31:05] <FromDiscord> <codic> otherwise some clients that just try to do it work, like chromium, but others don't, like firefox, because first it checks if its supported
[01:31:08] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Yeah that shows which atoms are supported
[01:33:33] <FromDiscord> <codic> oh it's just an enum that you populate

[01:53:47] <nrds> <06Prestige99> haha np
[01:54:00] <FromDiscord> <top level await> the hint of js
[01:54:04] <FromDiscord> <top level await> comes from the `var` and `let`
[01:54:13] <FromDiscord> <top level await> so i sometimes write `const` instead of `let`
[01:54:39] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Yeah it throws me off sometimes going back and forth between nim and js
[01:54:43] <FromDiscord> <top level await> python from the fact `from a import a` `import a` and `echo "hi"`
[01:55:00] <FromDiscord> <top level await> i constantly switch between java, js and python
[01:55:17] <FromDiscord> <top level await> i might drop java entirely if I get better at nim though
[01:55:42] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I pretty much only use nim and typescript now
[01:55:47] <FromDiscord> <top level await> I use java cause I don't need to pack anything togethr with it. Like you don't need 300 libaries. You can just grab swing and throw a theme on it lol
[01:56:02] <FromDiscord> <top level await> Also I think of js due to `nimble`
[01:56:10] <FromDiscord> <top level await> And the fact that you can install packages THAT quickly

[01:58:45] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Case statement macros or fusion/matching

[01:59:36] <nrds> <06Prestige99> normal case statements need to be compile time I believe
[02:00:13] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> What do you mean by that prestige?
[02:00:49] <nrds> <06Prestige99> like the `of "foo"` part
[02:01:18] <FromDiscord> <codic> yeah that is comptime known
[02:01:31] <FromDiscord> <codic> just like `of MotionNotify:`, etc
[02:02:27] <FromDiscord> <codic> XEvent is a union, so I want to switch on what type it is: https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/events/structures.html
[02:03:41] <nrds> <06Prestige99> yeah i think you should be able to do that
[02:03:41] <FromDiscord> <codic> also, is it ok to blanket recieve events with xselectinput and filter stuff out, or should i explicitly xgrabkey for everything I want?
[02:04:03] <nrds> <06Prestige99> only grab what you need

[04:10:27] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Those bindings are mostly for a renderer agnostic setting, if you want to actually render it you'll need to open up a window, setup a context and the similar using a file like that `timgui.nim`

[04:14:13] <FromDiscord> <Ayy Lmao> Because I am having some very strange behavior doing this where a sequence I use later on will throw an exception saying that it changed length while iterating over it
[04:14:16] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> though you can do `var memory = create(cDouble, cDoublesToWrite)`
[04:14:33] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> then you dont need the cast for the api call

[04:15:56] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> In this case you use `createU` since you dont need it to 0 memory
[04:17:56] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Also you're probably looking at a different error

[04:18:50] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Wait.. apiFuncThatWritesToACDoublePtr doesnt take an int?
[04:20:45] <FromDiscord> <Ayy Lmao> My problem still seems to persist. I don't really know how to provide testable code. This is an extremely elusive problem that makes zero sense to me. I am making a dll that is an extension for a DAW called Reaper. The problem only happens when I have a win32 dialog window running.
[04:21:03] <FromDiscord> <Ayy Lmao> In reply to @Elegantbeef "Wait.. apiFuncThatWritesToACDoublePtr doesnt take": It does, I just didn't add it in my pseudo example
[04:21:53] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Cause that error makes 0 sense when talking about this code
[04:23:31] <FromDiscord> <Ayy Lmao> It's a weird problem, basically I am trying to request for some audio data from Reaper. The sequence being resized while iterating error happens if I try to loop through `rawBuffer` in my example and build a sequence with `mySeq.add`.
[04:23:55] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> What's that loop look like?
[04:24:17] <FromDiscord> <Ayy Lmao> If I allocate the required samples beforehand and just write them to the sequence like `mySeq[i] = sample`, it works, but causes some weird behavior later on

[04:26:10] <FromDiscord> <Ayy Lmao> If I use this function to get the audio, and then later on try to loop through the return of it and build a sequence from it by using the `add` function, it will say the sequence changed length while iterating over it
[04:26:55] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> there is no do while so you can just init the vars before hand then run the while loop

[04:46:36] <FromDiscord> <Ayy Lmao> `reaper/wrapper.nim` has most of the functions I'm talking about. If I call the `analyzePitch` function in `pitchcorrection/editor.nim` that's when the problems start.
[04:47:16] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Do you have a way setup to test this?
[04:49:37] <FromDiscord> <Ayy Lmao> I'm super unorganized at the moment so not really. It most likely only works on windows at the moment since I don't have other platforms to test on. If you have windows I could try to walk you through it

[04:51:46] <FromDiscord> <Ayy Lmao> I have a build script in `scripts` that builds it, but it is hardcoded for windows. It should be able to be run on other platforms but you need to properly link the files in `WDL/swell`

[04:56:29] <FromDiscord> <Ayy Lmao> In reply to @Elegantbeef "Well the issue is": I have no idea how to set something like that up, I've just been commenting out parts of the code to narrow down the issue.
[04:57:10] <FromDiscord> <Ayy Lmao> I am almost certain it involves the memory allocation in the peaks function. Because if I generate a sine wave manually without asking reaper for audio it doesn't have problems

[05:14:05] <FromDiscord> <Ayy Lmao> I have a hunch that the function I'm calling to get the audio data from reaper `PCM_Source_GetPeaks` intends you to keep polling it or something. It's not super well documented but it says in the docs that it returns information about how many samples it wrote. I was thinking that it blocks until it's done but that might not be the case.

[06:48:06] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> What i do is use a `Button(btn: 1..5, state: cuint)` as a key to a hashtable for finding the event
[06:48:43] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> https://github.com/beef331/goodwm/blob/master/src/goodwm/desktops.nim#L224 which means I call this
[06:50:07] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Though my WM does have some questionable architecture
[07:13:20] <FromDiscord> <@bracketmaster-5a708063d73408ce4> sent a long message, see http://ix.io/3vdx
[07:13:34] <FromDiscord> <@bracketmaster-5a708063d73408ce4> To be more clear, nim complains that the files imported in test\_lexer are never used
[07:19:55] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#pragmas-used-pragma
[07:21:03] <FromDiscord> <codic> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3vdz
[07:21:39] <FromDiscord> <codic> i can use a conditional to solve it yeah
[07:23:58] <FromDiscord> <codic> hmm so I got right click to forward
[07:23:59] <FromDiscord> <codic> but not left click
[07:24:17] <FromDiscord> <codic> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3vdA
[07:30:04] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Nope, i manage the input internally after capturing everything i "need"
[07:52:10] <FromDiscord> <codic> hmm where does this `d` come from?
[07:54:32] <FromDiscord> <codic> also the issue I think is I don't grab left clicks without alt
[07:54:58] <FromDiscord> <Bung> am looking at disruptek's cps module, It seem it not compatible with other async libs ?
[07:54:59] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's my desktop object that i instantiate before my main loop in `goodwm.nim`
[07:56:23] <FromDiscord> <codic> hmm i see
[07:57:29] <FromDiscord> <codic> oh wait i see my issue; the reason right click works is because it is only Alt + RClick
[07:57:43] <FromDiscord> <codic> soo XSendEvent doesn't work
[07:57:50] <FromDiscord> <codic> what other approach could I take hmm
[07:58:59] <nrds> <06Prestige99> hey codic I just got back. What are you trying to do?
[08:00:37] <FromDiscord> <codic> i'm trying to make it so that I can use my left mouse button to raise a window if it's not already raised, then click on it in the clicked spot
[08:01:02] <FromDiscord> <codic> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3vdL
[08:01:37] <FromDiscord> <codic> and in the main loop I tried forwarding the events, but it doesn't look to work; it raises the window but doesn't forward the events
[08:01:39] <FromDiscord> <codic> http://hastebin.com/epapaniruz.yaml
[08:02:14] <nrds> <06Prestige99> So the way I handled that, is by using XGrabButton with AnyButton and AnyModifier (so you can capture click events without modifiers). Then, once the window becomes raised/focused, I use XUngrabButton with AnyButton and AnyModifier, then XGrabButton again with the modifiers I want
[08:02:28] <nrds> <06Prestige99> for my wm I use the Super key
[08:03:11] <nrds> <06Prestige99> https://github.com/avahe-kellenberger/nimdow/blob/master/src/nimdowpkg/windowmanager.nim#L768
[08:03:30] <nrds> <06Prestige99> woops I meant https://github.com/avahe-kellenberger/nimdow/blob/master/src/nimdowpkg/windowmanager.nim#L731
[08:04:42] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I should actually have an else on line 751 but it doesn't matter
[08:10:38] <FromDiscord> <codic> I used `0` instead of `AnyModifier` that might have caused the issue
[08:10:49] <nrds> <06Prestige99> ah
[08:13:04] <FromDiscord> <codic> nope, same issue
[08:13:25] <nrds> <06Prestige99> What issue are you having exactly?
[08:13:27] <FromDiscord> <codic> i'm grabbing/ungrabbing the pointer instead of the window
[08:13:47] <FromDiscord> <codic> left click events aren't forwarded to the application
[08:14:27] <FromDiscord> <codic> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3vdO
[08:14:33] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I'm not sure what you mean by "instead of the window"
[08:16:00] <nrds> <06Prestige99> You won't get button events if you aren't already listening for them
[08:17:47] <FromDiscord> <codic> i use XGrabPointer instead of XGrabWindow
[08:18:00] <FromDiscord> <codic> wait there is no xgrabwindow
[08:18:16] <nrds> <06Prestige99> XGrabButton is what I'm using
[08:18:28] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I'm also using XGrabButton
[08:18:33] <FromDiscord> <codic> me as well
[08:18:48] <FromDiscord> <codic> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3vdQ
[08:18:50] <FromDiscord> <codic> for moving and resizing I'm using XGrabPointer
[08:18:51] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I call this after loading a config https://github.com/beef331/goodwm/blob/master/src/goodwm/desktops.nim#L247
[08:18:59] <nrds> <06Prestige99> can you echo in your case statement? I don't think you're going to be getting button events
[08:19:19] <nrds> <06Prestige99> oh you do that earlier, cool
[08:19:53] <FromDiscord> <codic> i do get events, because resizing and moving still is working
[08:20:24] <FromDiscord> <codic> it is just forwarding a click to the application that isn't working (i'll add a XRaiseWindow before here later, i just want to get it to work first)
[08:20:25] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Really should use constants in x.nim instead of 1 or 0 btw
[08:20:36] <FromDiscord> <@bracketmaster-5a708063d73408ce4> thanks beef
[08:20:46] <FromDiscord> <codic> here is the full file: https://hastebin.com/gikasitifi.yaml
[08:20:59] <nrds> <06Prestige99> have you read https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/input/XGrabPointer.html ?
[08:21:10] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> And i shouldnt give any help prestige since i have 0 idea if my WM is even done properly \:D
[08:21:34] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Haha nah you're good man
[08:22:43] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Xephyr + logging helped me figure things out, a lot

[08:24:20] <nrds> <06Prestige99> could it have anything to do with a LeaveNotify event being generated after you call XUngrabPointer?
[08:25:33] <FromDiscord> <codic> not sure, I haven't selected those events in XSelectInput
[08:25:38] <FromDiscord> <codic> only substructurenotifymask
[08:31:29] <FromDiscord> <codic> i don't think so I think it's just a simple logic error
[08:31:34] <FromDiscord> <codic> but for some reason actually
[08:31:43] <FromDiscord> <codic> even if I remove the else, it never reaches the sending button release
[08:31:55] <FromDiscord> <codic> so it looks like button release is never recieved?
[08:32:49] <nrds> <06Prestige99> what do you expect to happen and what behavior are you observing?
[08:35:31] <FromDiscord> <codic> I expect that when I click a button and release it, a ButtonRelease event is recieved but I don't get it
[08:35:50] <FromDiscord> <codic> except if I alt + right click
[08:35:58] <FromDiscord> <codic> of course, normal right click would not work
[08:36:01] *** Quits: supakeen (~user@python/site-packages/supakeen) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[08:36:02] <FromDiscord> <codic> but left click should work, without a modifier
[08:36:05] <FromDiscord> <codic> because I XGrabKey that
[08:36:18] <FromDiscord> <codic> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3vdW
[08:36:30] <FromDiscord> <codic> oh do I have to do
[08:36:37] <FromDiscord> <codic> ButtonPressMask or ButtonReleaseMask
[08:36:38] <FromDiscord> <codic> perhaps
[08:36:41] <nrds> <06Prestige99> yes
[08:36:51] <FromDiscord> <codic> yep
[08:36:58] <nrds> <06Prestige99> check the function in my code that I linked
[08:37:06] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I'm using       ButtonPressMask or ButtonReleaseMask or PointerMotionMask,
[08:37:54] <FromDiscord> <codic> now it sends button presses and releases with xsendevent but the window doesnt react to them
[08:38:59] <FromDiscord> <codic> i think it just ignores the xsendevent...
[08:40:43] <FromDiscord> <codic> i'm not sure how I can fake a button press
[08:41:09] <FromDiscord> <codic> and have the client think its a normal one
[08:43:50] <FromDiscord> <codic> xtest has XTestFakeButtonEvent which doesnt have x and y parameters
[08:48:26] <FromDiscord> <codic> i might just handle motionnotify for focus, super+click to raise, and do the rest later
[08:49:50] <FromDiscord> <codic> (edit) "do the rest later" => "figure this out"
[08:50:09] <FromDiscord> <codic> generally I use keyboard for this anyways
[08:51:42] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> That's mostly what i do
[08:52:28] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Only watch for my shortcuts, and use XGrabButton/Key
[08:54:12] <FromDiscord> <codic> ok now on to finally getting reparenting done
[08:54:23] <FromDiscord> <codic> hopefully i can use my crappy wm in a week or two
[08:54:30] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> reparenting?
[08:56:09] <FromDiscord> <codic> fancy window borders, drawing windows that are bigger than the actual window and setting them as the parent of the actual window to map on the screen
[08:56:20] <FromDiscord> <codic> more complicated but gives you a lot more control
[08:56:24] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Ah didnt realize that was how that was done
[08:56:25] <FromDiscord> <codic> because the background window can be absolutely anything
[08:57:06] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> My worst idea was to use sdl2 to open my status bar windows \:D
[08:57:29] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Works and was easy but takes my program from like 1MB to 24MB of ram \:D

[09:54:25] <FromDiscord> <codic> how do you render texdt on the bar?

[09:54:42] <FromDiscord> <codic> oh huh cool

[09:55:21] <FromDiscord> <codic> how do you get pixie's output to render onto a window then?
[09:55:28] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Using sdl2
[09:55:45] <FromDiscord> <codic> i wrote a small bar before it's not that bad, just inbuilt font rendering is super super bad but pango makes it ok
[09:55:53] <FromDiscord> <codic> ah
[09:55:55] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I want to get rid of that dependency but spent about an hour today trying to and decided "well i'll keep it i guess"
[09:56:24] <FromDiscord> <codic> in x11 pango text should be pretty easy, for circles in xlib there's XDrawArc
[09:56:25] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I should be capable of copying the image it generates to the X window, but couldnt figure out how
[09:56:34] <FromDiscord> <codic> i should figure out how to make my event loop async
[09:56:42] <FromDiscord> <codic> maybe spawn a new thread whenever an event is recieved
[09:57:04] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I'm also presently using a thread for drawing my status bars, though i do want to see if i can use CPS here
[09:58:49] <FromDiscord> <codic> i might switch to xcb but it just looks like overcomplication because for 99% of my tasks the style is just making code verbose
[09:59:07] <FromDiscord> <codic> it's basically just functions return a xcb cookie, like a nim Future[T]
[09:59:43] <FromDiscord> <codic> and it makes the request, but doesnt fetch the value from the server until you try to get the value the cookie holds
[10:13:06] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Yeah it's basically async, non-blocking
[10:13:12] <nrds> <06Prestige99> xlib isn't that bad imo though
[10:15:34] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's not too bad this time around, only major issue is the blocking main loop 😀

[10:40:07] <FromDiscord> <undersquire> lol
[10:40:08] <FromDiscord> <Rika> and what errors are we talking about
[10:40:15] <FromDiscord> <undersquire> let me get the error one sec

[10:43:10] <FromDiscord> <Rika> because otherwise your command is incorrect?
[10:43:56] <FromDiscord> <undersquire> -- flags are just flags
[10:44:44] <FromDiscord> <undersquire> tho i guess it makes sense since im assuming they are specific to the option selected `c, cpp, js

[10:44:45] <FromDiscord> <undersquire> (edit) "js" => "js`"
[10:45:19] <FromDiscord> <Rika> just like how some programs that run other programs pass flags after raw `--` to the program

[10:46:12] <FromDiscord> <codic> In reply to @Elegantbeef "Me being a dumb": i like xlib too but I was thinking of threading too, what issues did you notice?
[10:46:16] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's a known issue with `-d:lto` doesnt play well with specific compilers
[10:46:18] <FromDiscord> <undersquire> In reply to @Elegantbeef "`--passC:-flto`": I saw on the docs that -d:lto replaces that
[10:46:19] <FromDiscord> <undersquire> oh
[10:46:24] <FromDiscord> <Rika> not for clang
[10:46:39] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I'm not threading Xlib but instead my status bar drawing
[10:46:43] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Which resulted in that issue
[10:47:57] <FromDiscord> <codic> why don't you just after handling an event, check if you need to redraw the bar and if so do it there?
[10:48:13] <FromDiscord> <undersquire> are you making a wm
[10:48:39] <FromDiscord> <codic> yes, 3 people here apparently including myself lol
[10:48:42] <FromDiscord> <codic> lots of nim wms
[10:48:45] <FromDiscord> <undersquire> lol nice
[10:49:24] <FromDiscord> <undersquire> also just curious what was the smallest nim executable you've ever seen
[10:49:45] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Elegantbeef do you plan on making your wm widely usable?
[10:49:53] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I've been using mine for about a year now I think
[10:49:59] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> "widely usable"?
[10:50:18] <nrds> <06Prestige99> my brain is too tired for good English
[10:50:40] <nrds> <06Prestige99> like something you can use as your daily driver
[10:50:55] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> That's my goal yea
[10:51:14] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Though my workspace replacement idea might not work well
[10:51:44] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> May be too much like alt tab \:P
[10:52:15] <nrds> <06Prestige99> ah I see
[10:52:32] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I need to implement my insane tags idea, sometime... 
[10:52:50] <FromDiscord> <codic> i should try using nimdow while I work on my own
[10:52:51] <nrds> <06Prestige99> 81 tags (workspaces) per monitor, like a 2d array 9x9
[10:52:53] <FromDiscord> <codic> seems very cool
[10:53:02] <FromDiscord> <codic> yeah spatial workspaces are awesome
[10:53:02] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Thanks
[10:53:52] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> My biggest issue with i3wm work spaces is the numbers are arbitrary and not overly helpful
[10:53:53] <FromDiscord> <codic> yeah looks like it's pretty dwm like, i like it
[10:54:01] <FromDiscord> <codic> but without the silly conflicting patches
[10:54:08] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Like yes i can do "Move to 6" but it's not easy to reason where 6 is
[10:54:33] <FromDiscord> <codic> systray too, nice
[10:54:40] <FromDiscord> <codic> for me horizontal workspaces are fine
[10:54:48] <FromDiscord> <codic> what do you mean it's not easy to reason?
[10:54:56] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I'm planning on having a toggable button that moves any new window created to it's own workspace
[10:55:12] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Well i have 3 monitors and havent setup workspaces
[10:55:17] <FromDiscord> <codic> in the status bar?
[10:55:23] <FromDiscord> <codic> oh yes i have 1 monitor
[10:55:27] <FromDiscord> <codic> i see how it can get confusing then
[10:55:51] <FromDiscord> <codic> i think if I end up supporting multiple monitors, it will probably be 9 tags / monitor
[10:56:03] <FromDiscord> <codic> so like with 3 monitors it would be 27 tags, and each monitor gets its own set of tags
[10:56:12] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I much prefer the idea that i can carousel through monitors, and then move to a new monitor optionally choosing if it moves to a new workspace or not
[10:56:31] <FromDiscord> <codic> hmm
[10:58:48] <FromDiscord> <codic> is it that bad that some of my code is inconsistent in how it uses ufcs and optional parens
[10:59:09] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I'd say yes
[10:59:19] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Possibly depends on what you're doing
[11:07:27] <FromDiscord> <codic> its just stuff like `abc def` vs `abc(def)`, i just use whichever seems clearer to me when I'm writing it
[11:08:24] <FromDiscord> <codic> hmm so nimdow doesn't support clickable status bar?
[11:08:29] <FromDiscord> <codic> well i dont need it anyways
[11:08:59] <nrds> <06Prestige99> nah, I pretty much don't use my mouse so I haven't bothered adding it yet
[11:09:06] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I believe there's an open issue for it
[11:10:40] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I'm off, see you all later o/

[11:11:24] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Buh bye
[11:18:34] <FromDiscord> <codic> ok now nimdow works, this is pretty familiar and awesom

[11:19:03] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Havent actually used nimdow i was meaning to try it but never got around to it
[11:21:33] <FromDiscord> <codic> huh, has notifications too it looks like

[12:52:53] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> None of those could pass

[12:53:30] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> i say none but the second branch is just wrong 😀
[12:53:41] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Otherwise you could look at fusion matching https://nim-lang.github.io/fusion/src/fusion/matching.html
