[03:06:50] <mats1> theres nothing complicated about 'usb data blockers'. some, like you said, are for forensics: blocking writes to maintain some semblance of chain-of-custody. then there's 'usb condoms', which prevent reads and writes, only charging. finally, there's epoxy

[15:26:10] <piou> 1) encrypting and encoding are two very very different things, and the fact that you confuse them worries me, 2) what asymmetric cipher, in what mode, 3) for good measure, what mode are you using with AES?
[15:27:25] <piou> At a high level there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with what you're trying to do, but the fact that you seem fuzzy on the details can hide deep and very important issues.

[15:33:49] <yates> s/selected on/selected it/
[15:34:41] <piou> Well, if we assume you make no mistake anywhere then sure you won't have any issue whatsoever
[15:36:17] <piou> At the highest level, the idea of using an asymmetric cipher to pass a symmetric key is correct. You should have a rotation of key in place at some point because you can't keep reusing the same key over and over, but how long exactly depends on what cipher exactly you use and for what amount of data. You should not need to change the assymetric key for each symmetric one though.

[15:43:54] <piou>  If it's not a hobby project, then you're going to have actual users that depend on the security choices you make. Cryptography is very difficult to get right, and the least you are familiar with it the more you should try to use high-level constructs. AES by itself is already a low level one, for example you said nothing about what mode you're going to be using but that is critical to the
[15:44:00] <piou> security of the encryption. The alternatives depend on your specific context, but using TLS if available, using libsodium's cryptobox instead of working with AES itself, thriving to work at the highest possible level is the best way to avoid dangerous mistakes.
[15:44:36] <piou> I'm not talking about an alternative for the backup itself, but for the encryption you're designing

[16:19:26] <piou> A block cipher such as AES works on blocks of fixed size (eg: 128 bits for AES). If you have less than that, you're going to need padding (yet another critical topic). If you have more than that, you're going to chunk your data into blocks. Now, if you just encrypt naively each block independantly then you're going to have issues because two identical blocks will be identical. Furthermore you
[16:19:32] <piou> open yourself to attacks such as block swapping (since blocks have no concept of order you can just rearrange encrypted blocks and they will decrypt just fine). A mode is a way to encrypt multiple blocks together so that you fix these issues and more. For example CBC does so by using the previous block to encrypt the next, creating a chain. Any modification in a block other than the last will
[16:19:38] <piou> have repercussions on all other blocks, making any modification moot. Now there is another very important topic: authentication. Encrypting without having a mechanism to check that the message wasn't modified is useless in most cases, dangerous in all others. Never encrypt without authentication. You can encrypt then use a HMAC for authentication using a separate key (that must also be managed),
[16:19:44] <piou> and check the HMAC before any decryption. But that's another process and it can have its own mistakes. That's why modern modes bake authentication inside the mode: that's called AEAD. GCM-SIV is an example of such a mode.
[16:20:23] <piou> What mode you choose has deep implications about additionnal metadata that you need to compute and track and communicate, about additional key management, and most of them require an initialization value that must also be generated and managed correctly (where "correctly" depends on what mode was chosen).
[16:21:06] <piou> Any mistake at any of these stages can ruin encryption completely. Which is why I insist so much on saying that just saying "I use AES" is not enough

[16:40:43] <piou> yates: If you don't know what to take, AES-256 with GCM-SIV mode and PKCS7 padding sounds good, but it may prove a bit slow if you have a huge amount of data. Using GCM instead of GCM-SIV can paliate that if you have hardware support but it makes issues such as nonce reuse more dramatic so if you can avoid it it's probably better. If you don't have hardware acceleration for AES-GCM, then
[16:40:49] <piou> XChacha20-Poly1305 would be a good faster candidate.

[16:54:53] <piou> yo
[16:55:13] <roxlu> I've been reading up on JSON Web Tokens and ECDSA and wondering about some terminology as used in Apples documentation mentioning JWT ...
[16:55:30] <roxlu> ECDSA is a signing/verification system and not an encryption system right?
[16:56:58] <piou> absolutely, DSA stands for Digital Signature Algorithm
[16:57:23] <roxlu> thanks!
[16:58:05] <roxlu> Is the part where they say "Encrypt the resulting" on this page https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_token-based_connection_to_apns wrong? should it be "sign"
[17:00:00] <piou> it may not be, normal JWT only sign but maybe they also use it to encrypt the token. Gotta go, sorry, I don't have time to read their spec
[17:00:21] <roxlu> Ok thanks piou
[17:01:02] <roxlu> I think you can also encrypt the contents of JWT (or you can ofc) but if ECDSA is used for signing I was wondering how one would encrypt it.

[18:33:52] <sphalerite> Hi folks. I'd like a tool like netcat, but encrypted and authenticated on both ends, "ad-hoc" without the use of certificates. I gather TLS-PSK can be used for this, and I've managed to connect an s_client and an s_server with a randomly generated PSK, but I've been taught to be scared of crypto and not to do things just because they work :) So I guess my main question is: under what
[18:33:53] <sphalerite> circumstances will TLS-PSK provide me with those properties?

[18:35:21] <sphalerite> I also know that SRP exists and think it would be nice to have it based on a password, but according to Wikipedia it authenticates the client to the server — no mention of authenticating the server to the client.

[18:40:08] <ajak> how else will you know you're talking to the same thing on the other end?
[18:40:20] <ajak> you could of course turn off host key checking

[18:40:51] <ajak> so it seems like you want authentication without authentication :)
[18:42:49] <sphalerite> OK, maybe I should rephrase: can I produce an authenticated encrypted connection from a shared human-readable secret?
[18:43:36] <sphalerite> Or maybe to establish an encrypted connection, then authenticate by verifying a string of words or emoji on both sides, or something like that…
[18:43:45] <mnemon> you can perform the authentication by only showing it to the intended user
[18:45:11] <sphalerite> Basically netcat but encrypted, authenticated, with ad-hoc keys, and with some "pleasant" UX for performing the authentication
[18:47:06] <mnemon> TLS-PSK works as long as you exchange the PSK in a manner that guarantees only the intended peer receives it.
[18:47:24] <mnemon> meaning it cannot be over the connection itself for an example, no matter how many emojis you convert it into

[21:55:20] <ghostbuster> has anyone done recent evaluations of the overall security of the major SOHO routers, like ubiquit vs mikrotik vs pfsense?
[21:57:46] <MadCamel> Unsure, but I'd like to mention that ubiquiti took over 3 weeks to distribute a patch for the dnsmasq vuln. Which was an instant remote root vuln on their platform.
[21:57:46] <marder> hm, sry, haven't seen, but i think my honeapot is a lil bit outdated ;) ...looking for evaluations too
[21:59:49] <ghostbuster> i'm using ubiquity currently and generally not impressed with the direction the company is heading

[22:00:29] <MadCamel> Yeah I'll be flashing openwrt to my devices if I don't end up changing them out completely.
[22:01:08] <ghostbuster> i will miss the 'single pane of glass' but the company has clearly been hollowed out of all the good engineers
[22:01:40] <ghostbuster> i am still running a major version behind of the management software because of all the bad things i've heard about 6.x

[23:20:43] <sphalerite> viq|w: tailscale isn't what I want because that involves setting up a trust relationship between the two hosts and they don't necessarily have internet connectivity. Magic wormhole is close to what I want, but I want a "bidirectional pipe" sort of thing like with netcat, and (since they don't necessarily have internet) don't want a handshake server (though this is the kind of UX I'm looking for,
[23:20:45] <sphalerite> modulo specifying IP addresses); croc seems to be the same as magic-wormhole in that respect?
