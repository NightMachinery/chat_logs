[00:24:37] <ikke> No, just when the container is initialized

[01:05:10] <jpic> try it out, docker compose config with some stack level volume and networks will now dump a config that contains the project name prefixes
[01:05:34] <jpic> which make the output config non-portable from a project to another ...
[01:07:12] <programmerq> oh yeah, that's definitely not what you want.
[01:07:34] <programmerq> I added my üëç on your issue (not that I have any say)
[01:07:50] <jpic> thank you deeply <3
[01:09:18] <SomeDamnBody> DX099, I still think I need containers to connect to swarm instances at some point
[01:10:01] <DX099> then you expose your swarm services
[01:15:26] <SomeDamnBody> But isn't exposed the same as opening a port?
[01:15:37] <rawtaz> jpic: is the problem that they started outputting those lines you gave an example of, or that the contents of those lines have the funky ID in them? i guess the former, that before they didnt include it at all?
[01:16:44] <jpic> the problem is that it started outputing those lines, the syncthing volume was just defined in a service, not globally, and the default network probably has no reason to be there at all

[01:17:28] <programmerq> SomeDamnBody‚ñ∏ last I had seen, you had still provided only minimal information about the error and were still redacting and omitting output of the commands you were running. You can connect a container to a --attachable network and have it communicate with swarm services on that network or other non-swarm containers that are attached.

[01:25:32] <programmerq> no, you don't need to port publish for container-to-container communication.
[01:25:57] <DX099> yes, if you do the above you mentionned
[01:26:54] <ikke> fun, docker compose logs --follow does not seem to respond to ctrl+c anymore
[01:27:00] <DX099> without that configuration, the non-swarm container don't know the Swarm service

[01:27:43] *** Joins: yaalon (~yaalon@cpe-70-121-160-255.satx.res.rr.com)
[01:28:44] <programmerq> correct, if any container is not attached to the network where another container is attached, it can't communicate with that container.
[01:30:36] <SomeDamnBody> programmerq, I used --attachable, and that doesn't allow the connect API call that I am making to go through
[01:30:48] <SomeDamnBody> I sent you other links, perhaps you didn't open them all
[01:31:14] <programmerq> SomeDamnBody‚ñ∏ again, what you provided in the pastebins seemed fairly incomplete. Last I remember asking was for you to show other commands and corresponding output like ping, curl, dig/drill, and other network tools
[01:31:23] <SomeDamnBody> What else did you ask for
[01:31:27] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@c-65-96-171-157.hsd1.ma.comcast.net)
[01:31:28] <programmerq> I scrolled up and didn't see anything, but it's possible that I missed that?
[01:31:44] <SomeDamnBody> You asked for ping and I told you that it worked for the target
[01:31:56] <SomeDamnBody> Same ip as the malamute connect call
[01:32:06] <programmerq> again, I didn't ask for you to tell me that something worked or didn't work
[01:32:11] <programmerq> I want to know the exact command, and all the output
[01:32:17] <programmerq> because you may be testing the wrong thing
[01:32:21] <programmerq> so I have to guess
[01:32:30] <SomeDamnBody> I'm starting to think it's something to do with the python malamute bindings
[01:32:31] <programmerq> since you're still having trouble, something isn't aligning
[01:32:56] <programmerq> and providing troubleshooting material like the actual commands and output will be critical if you are going to have anyone see what's going on
[01:33:10] <programmerq> just "it worked" doesn't tell me much other than you ran something
[01:33:53] <programmerq> that's also why I asked for curl and other network troubleshooting tool output-- your python output didn't give much info like whether it was no route to house, connection timed out, dns lookup failure, connection refused, etc...
[01:34:38] <programmerq> when I asked about your target container, you basically just said "yes it's listening" but didn't show anything that proved that there was a process inside the container listening on the correct interface. you showed the port publish output, which doesn't have anything to do with what the process in the container is doing
[01:34:46] <programmerq> so again, I have to guess what the problem might be
[01:35:24] <SomeDamnBody> programmerq, Oh, what I did to check that there is a processing listening was to start a container interactively and to run the entrypoint command as it is in the dockerfile
[01:36:03] <programmerq> then you said you were providing a docker network inspect output and then pasted a 'docker service ls' output, so I know you're doctoring what you do provide. it's quite hard to follow. so I'll reiterate one more time: show the full command, where you ran it, and all its output. use a paste service. make it clear what's happening in the target container and what's happening in the container trying
[01:36:05] <programmerq> to make the connection. check all the levels-- dns, tcp, icmp, etc...
[01:36:59] <SomeDamnBody> programmerq, I didn't mean to paste docker service ls and not the docker network inspect
[01:37:03] <SomeDamnBody> That was an accident.
[01:37:36] <SomeDamnBody> I did provide those for a lot of things
[01:38:06] <SomeDamnBody> How I created my service https://pastebin.com/62tBELwV
[01:38:17] <rawtaz> i need providage of candy, asap
[01:38:18] <SomeDamnBody> My worker https://pastebin.com/Rgjt0T1w
[01:38:23] <programmerq> put them in one paste. gist is ideal because it lets you do multiple files
[01:38:41] <SomeDamnBody> programmerq, I have to expose my identity to do that.
[01:38:57] <programmerq> that's fine, you're not required to use gist
[01:39:08] <programmerq> but if you're going to use pastebin-- do it in one and clearly identify everything.
[01:39:37] <programmerq> your one paste should tell a complete story of the issue

[15:00:09] <faceface> tabakhase: hmm.. I can `docker run` the three different graphics flavours
[15:00:20] <tabakhase> making that as stages is a little odd... more dockerish would likely be either extra dockerfiles - or ship√ºping the driver-name in with a build-arg
[15:00:22] <faceface> (once I get their IDs from the logs)
[15:00:33] <faceface> right
[15:00:44] <faceface> It looked 'a little odd' to me too, but it works quite nicely
[15:01:07] <faceface> ship√ºping?
[15:01:21] <tabakhase> that you ""can"" do that 'is an accident' - just like beeing able to directly access the docker0 network-interface :P
[15:01:31] <faceface> hmm
[15:02:39] <tabakhase> think with buildX for example you dont have access to those images - def not with remote-builders, but i think even the local one "sandboxes" them away - dont quote me on that tho
[15:03:36] <faceface> I do see lines saying, "removing intermediat image ..." or similar

[15:06:56] <tabakhase> so ye, i think build-arg is the rightest thing there... and then some hacky `for flavor in intel amd nvidia; do docker build -t thing:$flavor --build-arg flavor=$flavor .; done`

[15:07:51] <faceface> I didn't know that
[15:08:01] <faceface> or rather... I forgot that
[15:08:28] <tabakhase> guess its "--target" not --stage

[15:08:49] <faceface> OK, that looks 'reasonable' to me
[15:09:14] <faceface> (not that I'm qualified to make that assessment...)
[15:10:34] <tabakhase> ends up beeing pretty much the same... FROM runner AS amd; RUN apk add --no-cache mesa-dri-swrast --- becomes ARG flavor; RUN apk add --no-cache mesa-dri-$flavor

[20:38:49] <programmerq> are you doing changes to requirements.txt? sometimes if I'm experimenting with changing that around, I'll split it into two files so my subsequent builds are faster. When it's all settled, I'll put it back into one.
[20:39:24] <programmerq> if your changes aren't to requirements.txt, then make sure you have the requirements install in its own step that will only have the cache busted if requirements.txt changes.
[20:40:23] <programmerq> so it'll be something like: FROM python       RUN mkdir -p /opt/app      WORKDIR /opt/app        COPY requirements.txt .           RUN pip install -r requirements.txt                
[20:40:36] <programmerq> then you'd COPY the rest of your application after that

[21:06:47] <programmerq> I also switched it to apk --no-cache so that it doesn't keep the apk index files in the image. it just downloads them, uses them, and discards them.
[21:07:14] <programmerq> and I collapsed several runs into fewer RUN statements to reduce layer count
[21:07:31] <queue[m]> yes, the chown was the longest part

[21:14:28] <programmerq> ah yes, good catch. I didn't test it out.
[21:14:56] <programmerq> also, subsequent builds should be much faster. If you change anything other than requirements.txt, the only layer that will be different is that ADD --chown .
[21:15:19] <programmerq> so all the apk and pip stuff can be skipped over unless you change the Dockerfile or change the requirements.txt file.
[21:15:43] <queue[m]> the major hang was waiting for the build to chown every file in /var/www/ at the end
[21:16:02] <queue[m]> when you said it would chown on the go i was like OMG A FIX! lol
[21:17:33] <programmerq> I updated that gist to show another slight speedup. Basically, I switched it so the pip install with the specific list of packages runs before the requinements.txt file gets added, so if you change the requirements.txt it only needs to rerun pip install -r requirements.txt and not everything.

[21:27:18] <programmerq> the next thing to do is your compose file in dev can bind mount your code into the container. That way you only need to rerun the build step if you change requirements.txt or the Dockerfile.
[21:27:41] *** Joins: gschanuel (~gschanuel@user/gschanuel)
[21:30:04] <programmerq> right now, you're putting it into a named volume which will copy it from the image to the named volume. I updated that same gist to show the docker-compose changes I'd do.
[21:31:06] <programmerq> I took out the named volume, I added the bind mount, I took out container_name because you lose the compose project namespacing stuff when you pin a container name. I removed the reference to that other image in favor of your local build.
[21:31:57] <queue[m]> i usually bind mount, i was always told its 'safer' to use volumes
[21:32:27] <programmerq> I would also remove the driver: bridge for the fullstack network, and I'd also considering just using 'default' instead of 'fullstack'. You don't even need to explicitly define the default network. I just updated the gist to reflect those changes.

[21:33:13] *** Joins: gschanuel (~gschanuel@user/gschanuel)
[21:33:18] <programmerq> yes, there are some issues when using a bind mount to be aware of. Your files will need to be readable by numeric uid:gid 1000:1000 since that's what you're running in the container. It's completely appropriate to use a bind mount in a dev workflow so you can have changes immediately available without copying everything to the image and then to a named volume.
[21:33:47] <programmerq> in fact, if you completely remove that named volume, you'd just end up using the code as it appears in the image without docker copying everything to a named volume
[21:33:58] <programmerq> so either a bind mount or no volume

[21:34:56] <queue[m]> thats the way i thought of it, i hated volumes for that fact
[21:35:32] <queue[m]> ok doing the changes you said now
[21:35:55] <programmerq> named volumes are where you'd want to put persistent data and not code.
[21:36:12] <programmerq> so in prod, you'd use the same dockerfile and no bind mount, and it'd just run the code that's inside the image.
[21:36:25] <queue[m]> that build just took 45 seconds

[21:37:34] <programmerq> now that you have a bind mount, you can do 'docker-compose restart' if you need gunicorn to reload its stuff. you'll only need to run the image build if you change the dockerfile or requirements.txt or you want to publish an image with the updated code for use with no bind mount in place.

[23:54:48] <arash> Hello, I installed docker in centos 7, i want to run botpress using docker run -d --name=botpress -p 3000:3000 botpress/server command
[23:54:59] <arash> but it return /usr/bin/docker-current: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?.
[23:55:05] <arash> how can i solve this?
[23:55:54] <ikke> Not sure how on centos7, but you need to start the docker service
[23:57:07] <arash> Its installed, its working when i type docker in terminal, how can i run it?
[23:57:27] <ikke> That's just the cli component
[23:57:42] <ikke> try sudo systemctl start docker
