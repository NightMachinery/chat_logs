[06:47:18] <kj7rrv> (i asked in ##sogo but didn't get a response) Is there a way to make logins persistent in SOGo? I never use computers that I don't own and keep physically secure, and I would like to stay logged in all the time
[06:47:37] <kj7rrv> I don't need it to be an option; I can manually log out if necessary
[06:48:03] <pj> hi kj7rrv, I don't have experience with SOGo but I'm sure if someone here does then they can pipe up and answer.
[06:48:31] <pj> Have you considered that most browsers have an option to remember the username and password for you, though?
[06:49:02] <kj7rrv> Yes, my browser does support that
[06:49:19] <kj7rrv> But SOGo logs me out a lot, including when I'm in the middle of typing an email
[06:49:27] <pj> oh, that sucks.
[06:49:43] <kj7rrv> It just started doing that with an update
[06:50:17] <pj> Honestly, you will probably get a better answer in #sogo, not saying that you can't ask here, but they would certainly be better qualified to answer there.
[06:50:30] <pj> errr ##sogo
[06:50:45] <kj7rrv> It was the same update that required an nginx config change to allow bigger cookies
[06:50:53] <kj7rrv> There are only three other people there
[06:50:56] <pj> ahhh, there's only five people in that channel, explains a lot.
[06:51:15] <pj> I would see if they have a mailing list, then.
[06:51:36] <kj7rrv> Oh, fobot is a bridge, but there doesn't seem to be much activity on the other platofrms
[06:51:39] <kj7rrv> *platforms
[06:51:46] <kj7rrv> They at least have a discord bridged
[06:52:00] <pj> ahhh, yep
[06:52:15] <kj7rrv> But still very little activity
[06:52:18] <pj> sometimes bridges fail, so if you ask on the other end of it you might be better off.
[06:52:42] <pj> They have a mailing list: https://www.sogo.nu/support.html
[06:52:43] <kj7rrv> I'll wait a while to see if anyone answers here, then I'll look for a mailing list
[06:53:09] <kj7rrv> I might see if they have matrix or some other foss platform, but I won't use discord
[06:53:53] <pj> it looks like the mailing list is the way to go with them.  A quick glance at the archives shows that it's quite active.
[06:54:37] <pj> in fact ...
[06:54:45] <pj> this may answer your question now: https://www.mail-archive.com/users%40sogo.nu/msg31272.html
[06:54:57] <kj7rrv> Oh okay, thank you! I'll subscribe
[06:55:15] <kj7rrv> I probably should be subscribed anyway, to hopefully hear about issues before i update
[06:55:28] <kj7rrv> (or to know when i need to update asap)
[06:55:53] <kj7rrv> That looks like exactly my problem, thank you!
[06:55:53] <pj> Just read that post, it answers your question.
[06:55:58] <pj> yw :-)
[06:57:01] <pj> From what I can gather there it looks like a incompatible change was made to the sessions table which is causing sessions to not be saved, hence they drop out right away.
[06:57:14] <kj7rrv> Oh okay, that makes sense
[06:57:35] * kj7rrv will start heeding the "run the migration scripts" messages
[06:57:42] <pj> hehehe
[06:58:01] <pj> anyways, let me know if that works for you.
[06:58:32] <kj7rrv> Okay i will, thank you
[06:59:18] * kj7rrv does not remember his MySQL password and has it written on a piece of paper 3 hours away
[06:59:38] <pj> hahaha
[06:59:47] <pj> That's never a good thing
[07:00:04] <kj7rrv> I'm going to start travelling with my password book
[07:00:25] <kj7rrv> Thankfully we're going home tomorrow
[07:01:06] <kj7rrv> So, I'll let you know if it works tomorrow
[07:01:12] <pj> cool

[13:34:40] <Khepra> Is anyone using dma (dragonfly mail agent)? I've recently started using it with SASL, and I see every attempt at using our relay, it tries cram-md5 auth, fails, and then proceeds with PLAIN. I can't seem to find any clues how to disable even trying cram-md5
[13:46:56] <Khepra> okay, looked into source. it asks the server for EHLO feature list, then does cram if it's listed.... ffs, why is my server listing cram-md5. I never told it to. it's working behind my back. I'll get to the bottom of this!
[14:08:06] *** Joins: labrador (~labrador@user/labrador)
[14:11:31] <pj> Khepra: what is the server, postfix?
[14:11:45] <pj> or is it dma as well?
[14:12:35] <Khepra> postfix. dma has no SMTP listener. 
[14:12:57] <Khepra> pj: but it's actually not postfix fault. I was wrong, the EHLO list doesn't say there's cram-md5. 
[14:13:48] <Khepra> there's a bug in dma but I can't figure out where. it asks the server for EHLO, then parses the AUTH string, then sets a features struct's auth.cram_md5 to 1 _if_ it finds "CRAM-MD5" in the AUTH String.
[14:14:08] <Khepra> but it doesn't. and yet it somehow sets this. nvm, offtopic for ##email I suppose.
[14:14:32] <pj> Khepra: make sure you're looking from an s_client connection to the submission (or submissions) port, not telnet to see the EHLO response.
[14:14:42] <Khepra> yeah, I know :)
[14:15:34] <Khepra> dma.conf is configured to use 465 directly, and I checked with openssl s_client,     AUTH PLAIN LOGIN    as it should be   (dovecot's the SASL implementation for my postfix)
[14:17:21] <pj> okay, but for some reason dma is trying CRAM-MD5?  That definately seems to be a dma issue, then.
[14:18:42] <Khepra> pj: yea it's dma issue. it tries cram-md5 if it's internal struct features->auth.cram-md5  integer is > 0 ;   it uses memset to init the struct to 0, and then sets that field to 1 if AUTH line in response to EHLO contains CRAM-MD5. accordign to the source. so either I'm missing somethign in the code, or that memset ain't doing what it's supposed to, so the integer is >0 because the memory is unclean
[14:20:46] <pj> I would ramp up the log level for postfix so you can see the actual SMTP transaction next and verify that postfix is really not sending CRAM-MD5 but dma is trying it anyways, just to make absolutely certain that's the issue.
[14:23:09] <pj> http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_loglevel ...set to 4, then you should be able to see the entire transaction in the logs.

[14:33:46] <Khepra> pj: that doesn't seem to be the case. yeah ther's a megaton of ascii dumps, but it's scrambled
[14:34:30] <Khepra> nvm. I mean... why would it respond with _one_ AUTH string to my openssl s_client check, and another to dma?  from same IP. I mean, I see thew config, there's no cram-md5 enabled in dovecot
[14:35:11] <pj> 4 Also log hexadecimal and ASCII dump of complete transmission after STARTTLS.

[14:35:57] <Khepra> doveconf -a | grep auth_mech   =>   auth_mechanisms = plain login          as it should be
[14:36:03] <pj> Obviously it's going to log a *lot* of crap there, especially if it's an active server, you need to filter through the crap.  That's why it's not normally recommended to set it to such a high level, or to keep it there.
[14:36:30] <Khepra> pj: I understand, but in the ascii portion, I see garbage, not any strings that would happen with EHLO
[14:36:37] <pj> yeah, but you need to look at what postfix is doing, ignore what dovecot is set to for now until you establish that.
[14:37:37] <Khepra> also, dma has certain syslog(LOG_DEBUG) entries in codepaths that should log if the server has or has not cram-md5, but those strings are never sent to syslog. 
[14:37:39] <pj> oh, maybe it's logging the encrypted content.
[14:38:32] <pj> although not sure why that would be helpful.
[14:40:24] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[14:41:41] <pj> you can enable verbose logging in master.cf, that should help.
[14:41:54] <Khepra> pj: but postfix logs side, if I connect to its submissions port and introduce myself with EHLO, and it says AUTH PLAIN LOGIN ... why would it say something else to dma's EHLO
[14:42:26] <Khepra> I really have to look at this from dma's perspective, perhaps even strace the thing...
[14:42:43] <pj> I have to go
[14:42:46] <pj> good luck
[14:42:51] <Khepra> thanks anyway ;)
