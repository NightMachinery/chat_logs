[08:09:41] <Rockwood> hi
[08:10:16] <Rockwood> is possible to add buttons on background image?
[08:10:29] <Rockwood> if yes how to doable?
[08:51:31] <FunkyBob> err
[08:51:39] <FunkyBob> wat?
[08:52:57] <FunkyBob> you want to place buttons within an element that has a background image?
[08:52:59] <FunkyBob> or something else?
[08:59:34] <Rockwood> oops
[08:59:46] <Rockwood> that is solved
[08:59:51] <Rockwood> but another issue
[08:59:58] <Rockwood> how to make it inline
[09:00:14] <Rockwood> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-huv5w?file=/demo.js
[09:00:20] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, ^^
[09:01:13] <Rockwood> i wanna make inline every stuff of  <span>
[09:02:17] <FunkyBob> ...
[09:02:26] <FunkyBob> the only span I've seen so far is the on in <Box>
[09:02:35] <FunkyBob> oh, no, there's others.
[09:02:39] <FunkyBob> which ones are you talking about?
[09:02:39] <Rockwood>     "& span": {
[09:02:40] <Rockwood>       display: "flex",
[09:02:44] <FunkyBob> stop making it hard to know what you mean
[09:02:57] <Rockwood> sorry my english is not proper
[09:04:09] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, i am talking about this part of code -> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/8GhHmb5KYc/
[09:04:44] <FunkyBob> that doesn't appear to be in the sandbox you linked to
[09:05:59] <Rockwood> oh
[09:06:01] <Rockwood> okay
[09:06:09] <Rockwood> now i saved up
[09:06:19] <Rockwood> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-huv5w?file=/demo.js
[09:06:22] <Rockwood> see now
[09:06:26] <FunkyBob> but likely the issue is <Hx> are all display block by default
[09:06:27] <Rockwood> its now inline
[09:06:46] <Rockwood> Hx  --> x stands for?
[09:07:04] <FunkyBob> a number 1 to 6
[09:07:10] <Rockwood> ok
[09:07:10] <FunkyBob> so H1, H2, H3..... H6
[09:07:30] <Rockwood> should i use simple test there?
[09:07:34] <Rockwood> text
[09:08:37] <Rockwood> or nested span better option?
[09:08:53] <Rockwood> like span > span
[09:09:30] <Rockwood> both side i wanna place rating buttons and in middle i wanna show total number of rating collected
[09:09:55] <Rockwood> this my simple concern from the code
[09:10:45] <FunkyBob> that depends on what its meaning is in the document
[09:12:04] <Rockwood> oops its not solving my requirement
[09:13:57] <Rockwood> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-huv5w?file=/demo.js text is not showing as required there
[09:14:40] <Rockwood>     "& span > span": { oops not works
[09:14:52] <Rockwood> if i do anything
[09:14:58] <Rockwood> its mean block
[09:15:07] <Rockwood> so span isn't good idea i think
[09:15:35] <FunkyBob> it's not span's fault
[09:15:52] <Rockwood> then?
[09:15:55] <FunkyBob> though since i still don'tk now what you want to look like what... it's hard to help
[09:16:09] <Rockwood> 2 sec
[09:16:26] <Rockwood> <icon> text <icon>
[09:16:32] <Rockwood> like this just
[09:16:43] <Rockwood> at bottom of image
[09:16:58] <Rockwood> bottom is fine
[09:17:16] <Rockwood> just inline icon and text is my concern now
[09:17:36] <Rockwood> i have done flex there
[09:17:47] <Rockwood> i think i need block there instead of flex
[09:19:25] <FunkyBob> just so long as all the elements are display: inline; they'll inline
[09:19:30] <FunkyBob> however flex can also achieve that
[09:19:32] <FunkyBob> depending on the needs
[09:20:34] <Rockwood>       display: "inline-block", what about this
[09:20:58] <Rockwood> https://www.samanthaming.com/pictorials/css-inline-vs-inlineblock-vs-block/
[09:21:07] <Rockwood> after read this article
[09:21:25] <Rockwood> i think good option -->  display: "inline-block"
[09:23:10] <Rockwood> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-huv5w?file=/demo.js oops how to make it correct now?
[09:24:41] <FunkyBob> so
[09:24:49] <FunkyBob> you're talking about the icons at the bottom of the image?
[09:25:12] <FunkyBob> so much irrelevant stuff in your sandbox, I don't know where to look
[09:25:12] <Rockwood> yes
[09:25:45] <Rockwood> <icon> text <icon>
[09:25:47] <FunkyBob> and what do you _want_ it ti look / behave like?
[09:25:54] <FunkyBob> span is the wrong container
[09:26:01] <Rockwood> ok
[09:26:13] <Rockwood> what should be there?
[09:26:17] <FunkyBob> that depends
[09:26:22] <Rockwood> simple text?
[09:26:29] <FunkyBob> fucks sake
[09:26:33] <FunkyBob> do you even see me asking questions?
[09:26:52] <Rockwood> sorry you can
[09:27:10] <FunkyBob> i did
[09:27:16] <FunkyBob> you seem to have ignored them
[09:27:22] <Rockwood> no
[09:27:40] <Rockwood> my english understand was the case
[09:27:44] <Rockwood> cause
[09:28:32] <FunkyBob> no it wasn't
[09:28:40] <FunkyBob> what do you want it to look like?
[09:28:44] <FunkyBob> how do you want it to behave?
[09:29:11] <Rockwood> in div at the bottom
[09:29:26] <Rockwood> both side buttons
[09:29:49] <Rockwood> and in between the buttons a text string
[09:29:50] <FunkyBob> so you want the icons up against the edges? and the text centered?
[09:29:57] <Rockwood> yes
[09:31:35] <FunkyBob> ok, a div with display: flex; flex-flow: row no-wrap;  and then  flex:1; text-align: center;  on the text span
[09:33:00] <Rockwood> not any single span ?
[09:33:24] <Rockwood>   imagePanel: { should i do on this?
[09:34:21] <Rockwood> https://gist.github.com/Cyberiaaxis/c8da266123d83ce309730a95a7884383#file-style-css-L11 not on this
