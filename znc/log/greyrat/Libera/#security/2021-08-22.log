[08:47:07] <MadCamel> so what would happen if you rigged things up where any process that executed 3 or 4 nops in a row was terminated? All exploits would need to know exact addresses..
[08:47:24] <MadCamel> no compiler just spams nops, you know
[08:47:43] <MadCamel> this deep thought brought to you by jack daniels.
[08:49:17] * ajak swears he's seen some asm somewhere that was full of nops
[08:50:15] <MadCamel> I'm sure there's some oddball code somewhere that does it
[08:50:26] <MadCamel> regardless.. it'd be another one of those mitigations that make things more difficult but not impossible
[08:51:55] <ajak> sounds high overhead to monitor every instruction going through the cpu, too
[08:54:40] <MadCamel> judging by the fixes for the various intel vulns I feel like it could be done at lowish overhead in microcode. Only the cpu makers know for sure..
