I created a new device OU and was thinking of just doing WMI with a startup script to license when first added to domain, then when I move it to the correct OU or its Win 10/11 VM It won't run. any flows in the idea?
[02:29:23] <Hunterkll> it's not covered by the license, you will have to activate via alternate methods/licensing
[02:29:41] <Hunterkll> Server license's guest OS entitlements (and AVMA functionality) are for Server OS's ONLY
[02:30:13] <Hunterkll> Since AVMA is only meant to activate the guests that you're entitled to by your server license, and that's only server OSes 
[02:30:45] <Hunterkll> "AVMA lets you activate *Windows Server* virtual machines (VMs) on Windows Server Hyper-V host that is properly activated, even in disconnected environments."
[02:32:13] <Hunterkll> Note here the supported OS chart for AVMA: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/automatic-vm-activation

[03:28:03] <catbeard> that's kinda sketch
[03:28:36] <YoungPotato> Hi all! I have a networking question: I am rsyncing 3TB to my Synology NAS of which I am the only user. The NAS is connected via ethernet to my Netgear Orbi router. My laptop that I use to push the data, which is stored on an external hard drive connected via firewire 800 to thunderbolt to usb c, is connected via 5ghz WiFi to this same Netgear Orbi router that is in the other room (10 meters / 30 feet). The Netgear Orbi rout
[03:28:36] <YoungPotato> theoretical speed of 866 mbit/sec. My laptop's wifi has a max bandwith of 300 mbit/sec. My upload speed via rsync (rsync -avmhe, no other options) is steady between 24 and 25 mbyte/sec, which is ~12 mbyte slower than the 300 mbit/sec (300/8=37.5) throughput of the laptop's wifi. Is this what you would expect taking into account that wifi is not an optimal signal? 
[03:29:22] <catbeard> also taking into account SSH based file transfer overhead
[03:29:26] <sd> 05<B‚Äãiz> Hello
[03:29:37] <sd> 05<B‚Äãiz> May i ask? Whats IRC?
[03:29:43] <YoungPotato> Could that account for that much?
[03:29:52] <catbeard> did you try `rsync -e 'ssh -c arcfour' ...`
[03:30:06] <sd> 05<B‚Äãiz> What does irc stand for?
[03:30:08] <YoungPotato> I have not. Let me look into that.
[03:30:12] <catbeard> @Biz: internet relay chat
[03:30:34] <catbeard> we stand for nothing, we fall for everything
[03:32:10] <Hunterkll> so a 300mbit/sec wifi link might see 100mbit/sec reliably in all reality
[03:32:42] <Hunterkll> can go higher for sure, but you can't actually see 300mbit/sec in reality at all ever - not technically possible
[03:32:48] <Hunterkll> that's the phy/rf link, if i recall properly
[03:33:07] <Hunterkll> that includes wireless frame overhead etc
[03:33:12] <Hunterkll> also can't ignore tcp overhead
[03:34:34] <Hunterkll> wired ethernet has about a 94% efficiency (aka 6% overhead) for just the line protocol, whereas 802.11n was about 85%, and 802.11ac about 65% 
[03:34:54] <Hunterkll> so with 802.11ac, expect to actually receive only 65% of that 300mbit reliably, depending on modes/settings/etc
[03:35:18] <Hunterkll> nevermind the number of devices also impacting the time splitting/time division of sending out data/signals
[03:35:57] <YoungPotato> Hunterkll: That makes sense, 2/3 * 300 is approximately that 25 mbyte
[03:36:03] <Hunterkll> so 25mbyte/sec is about what i'd expect maximum on a 300mbit 802.11ac link
[03:36:17] <Hunterkll> assuming optimal conditions/hardware
[03:36:25] <Hunterkll> so it really sounds like you're actually doing pretty good
[03:36:51] <catbeard> you could upgrade to AX
[03:37:03] <Hunterkll> catbeard: or even just a better AC card :P
[03:37:04] <YoungPotato> catbeard I was reading up on the arcfour. Looks interesting, if not for now, then for later. But it seems you need to first enable allowing that encryption in the sshd on the receiving side. Not an issue of course.
[03:37:32] <Hunterkll> YoungPotato: also - often that 866mbit rating is actually two ratings..... added together
[03:38:33] <Hunterkll> ah no, it was probably sold as a 1266 or 1300 AC router 
[03:38:43] <Hunterkll> which was probably 400mbit on 2.4GHz and 866mbit on 5GHz AC
[03:38:43] <YoungPotato> Yeah, fortunately, I don't need to do these 'larger' (depends on the user of course) transfers. So, that puts less need for me on upgrading the card. I am a bit bummed about the laptop though, because I bought it this year and 300mbit now seems a bit weak to me.
[03:38:58] <Hunterkll> well, which model is the router
[03:39:12] <YoungPotato> Hunterkll: O, yeah, that combination makes sense. The number seemed weird to me.
[03:39:38] <Hunterkll> because there's a ton 
[03:40:01] <YoungPotato> Netgear Orbi RBK50
[03:40:06] <Hunterkll> like here's one model that lists "2.2 gbps maximum wifi speeds"
[03:40:54] <Hunterkll> yes
[03:40:58] <Hunterkll> that one says it has AC3000 wifi
[03:40:59] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:41:16] <Hunterkll> if you're using triband multiSSID support
[03:41:24] <Hunterkll> 1733 on one radio, 866 on the other, and 400 on the 2.5ghz
[03:41:38] <YoungPotato> I just pulled that number from the 192.168.1.1
[03:41:45] <Hunterkll> https://www.netgear.com/images/datasheet/orbi/RBK50.pdf
[03:41:50] <Hunterkll> 'technical specifications' 
[03:42:34] <Hunterkll> so to get the full "3000 mbit" you'd have to be using three separate wireless NICs bonded together on each of the connections, or three devices hammering it all at once lol
[03:43:01] <YoungPotato> Actually, let me correct that, it says next to 5g mode: 'Up to 866.7 Mbps'
[03:44:20] <Hunterkll> yea, you might have to set up radio 3 or whatever
[03:44:24] <Hunterkll> ah well either way 
[03:44:28] <Hunterkll> you get the idea
[03:44:33] <YoungPotato> Yes
[03:44:42] <YoungPotato> And in any case, the laptop will remain the bottleneck
[03:45:27] <YoungPotato> Thanks for your help Hunterkll and catbeard, much appreciated!

[03:51:50] <haise01> I assume I can glue it with SCCM and abuse the shit with those 2
[03:52:00] <Hunterkll> it can also do basic azure shit too 
[03:52:02] <Hunterkll> eh
[03:52:06] <Hunterkll> SCVMM not so much
[03:52:16] <Hunterkll> i mean, you can have SCVMM provision a VM set up for PXE boot and image 
[03:52:23] <Hunterkll> but you'll be looking more into SCORCH glue 
[03:52:34] <haise01> hmm, alright
[03:53:01] <Hunterkll> think of orchestrator like say, ansible
[03:53:06] <Hunterkll> which can trigger actions in both subsequently

[04:03:19] <Lemming> Great one at my work this week
[04:03:33] <catbeard> Work-BWMerlin: kinda
[04:03:35] <catbeard> not really though
[04:03:47] <Lemming> some of our application devs used a production service account on dev servers... and then managed to get the password wrong somewhere and start locking the account out
[04:03:57] <catbeard> Lemming: derp
[04:04:21] <Work-BWMerlin> But dev = prod
[04:04:27] <catbeard> no, prod = dev
[04:04:33] <Lemming> we narrowed it down to scheduled tasks on one server, one of the server team just pulled a list of scheduled tasks using that account... there's over 200 of them
[04:04:39] <catbeard> :|
[04:04:42] <iphone> prod ~= dev
[04:04:51] <catbeard> prod += dev
[04:04:57] <Lemming> so now the devs have to go through the tasks one by one, and try and figure out which one is the problem one
[04:04:59] <iphone> prod == dev++
[04:05:15] <Lemming> they wanted server team to do it, that's a hard no.
[04:05:16] <catbeard> prod ~* '^/dev/.*$'
[04:05:19] <Work-BWMerlin> $dev = testing
[04:05:25] <Work-BWMerlin> $testing = prod
[04:05:34] <Work-BWMerlin> $prod = dev
[04:05:52] <catbeard> so you have a website based on centos 8
[04:05:56] <catbeard> :D
[04:06:05] <Hunterkll> Lemming: doesn't sound too hard, but scheduled tasks on a management server does sound like server team work..... wouldn't want devs fucking around there
[04:06:19] <catbeard> that's why i've always advocated for a meta-api
[04:06:21] <Hunterkll> Lemming: but i'd just pull all tasks set with that service account, and iterate th rough and set the password on each one to the correct password
[04:06:21] <Lemming> Hunterkll they're scheduled tasks on a dev server
[04:06:24] <Hunterkll> that way 
[04:06:38] <Hunterkll> Lemming: yea we manage our dev environments like prod so that they dont do stu pid shit :P
[04:06:47] <Hunterkll> but that way you don't have to actually figure oit out
[04:06:51] <Hunterkll> though, event log should tell you quick enough 
[04:06:53] <Lemming> and where did I mention it was a management server?
[04:07:04] <Hunterkll> you didn't
[04:07:07] <catbeard> so like someone higher authority than you generates api creds for the service you want, then gives you another limited set of creds with reduced context and centralized management for tracking api cred usage and from where
[04:07:12] <Hunterkll> i mangled terms with what i meant to say 'managing' 
[04:07:13] <Hunterkll> as in teams
[04:07:14] <Hunterkll> but whatevs
[04:07:35] <haise01> oh shit  2 additional weeks of FFXIV sub for free
[04:07:43] <Hunterkll> another one?
[04:07:43] <catbeard> so like instead of hitting your https://api.whatever.io/key?key=YOUR_API_KEY
[04:07:45] <catbeard> you hit

[18:44:16] <SantasWiFi> lmfao
[18:44:21] <theSantasquirrel> ^^
[18:44:26] <JollyRgrs> unless i'm worried about some 3 letter agency parking outside my house, i'm not THAT concerned about an EOL AP
[18:44:34] <theSantasquirrel> ^^
[18:44:37] <SantasWiFi> xD
[18:45:01] <JollyRgrs> if they hack into my wifi at home, i'm already in a bad position
[18:45:02] <SantasWiFi> yeah and I also wouldn't dream of integrating google with my home automation
[18:45:05] <SantasWiFi> to each their own! :D
[18:45:11] <theSantasquirrel> If someone wants my secrets that bad, they will just bonk me on the head with a wrench until I tell them
[18:45:15] <JollyRgrs> SantasWiFi: pfft, i do!
[18:45:18] <SantasWiFi> JollyRgrs: i know ;D
[18:45:38] <JollyRgrs> but it's just for voice actions, it's mostly all handled by home assistant
[18:45:51] <theSantasquirrel> I wrapped my Google Home in aluminum foil and locked in a box
[18:45:56] <JollyRgrs> cept these stupid wifi sylvania bulbs... no, they won't play nice and i gotta control them via google
[18:46:14] <SantasWiFi> make fun all you want
[18:46:16] <JollyRgrs> i got a home in every room in the house except the bathrooms (and that might come next)
[18:46:17] <SantasWiFi> but opsec is a lifestyle
[18:46:20] <SantasWiFi> mostly /s
[18:46:22] <SantasWiFi> :D
[18:46:22] <theSantasquirrel> Hue works well standalone without the external connection
[18:46:38] <JollyRgrs> SantasWiFi: i know ppl who are VERY security conscious and have google homes in their home
[18:46:47] <JollyRgrs> hue also 'spenive
[18:46:48] <vinrock> posers
[18:46:51] <theSantasquirrel> But who will up end their entire ecosystem once bought in...not me
[18:47:21] <SantasWiFi> JollyRgrs: then they aren't very security conscious!
[18:47:23] <iphone> hehe im gay
[18:47:27] <iphone> where is dragonfleas
[18:47:29] <SantasWiFi> im just poking at you now im sorry lol
[18:47:37] <theSantasquirrel> Google also agrees they are very security conscious. xD
[18:47:40] <SantasWiFi> lolol
[18:48:04] <catbeard> JollyRgrs: only a matter of time before assistant starts picking fights with alexa while you're at work
[18:48:25] <SantasWiFi> does windows 11 pro come with alexa preinstalled too?
[18:48:29] <SantasWiFi> or is that just the home version?
[18:48:40] <theSantasquirrel> Google is also the company that mapped all the MACs and SSIDs of home as their clever little Google Maps cars rolled by and made the data available by API
[18:48:50] <catbeard> theSantasquirrel: didn't they remove that?
[18:48:53] <SantasWiFi> yeah that was fucked lol
[18:48:59] <theSantasquirrel> Oh yeah they did
[18:49:07] <theSantasquirrel> One they got caught
[18:49:08] <catbeard> i mean they're not the only company that does that
[18:49:12] <SantasWiFi> yeah

[18:50:34] <SantasWiFi> that was used, it was so popular
[18:50:39] <SantasWiFi> shit 1 sec
[18:50:42] <catbeard> the one i still use
[18:50:46] <catbeard> the ALFA
[18:50:47] <theSantasquirrel> Yeah and Macs have Airport CLI built in you just have to know how to get to ti
[18:50:56] <SantasWiFi> YES

[18:53:10] <theSantasquirrel> of course catbeard, I just don't ever do that, so I don't really need it
[18:54:25] <catbeard> SirSantalot: but log4j is not done with you yet
[18:54:25] <SantasWiFi> JollyRgrs: what games you been playin lately?
[18:54:28] <theSantasquirrel> I can use an old Macbook with Aircrack and drivers to play with it a little bit, but just enough to learn not very effective.
[18:54:51] <catbeard> theSantasquirrel: yeah you need the ALFA
[18:55:04] <catbeard> way more effective
[18:55:28] <catbeard> plus aircrack by itself = meh
[18:55:36] <catbeard> used in tanem with a recent wifite rewrite = w00t
[18:55:49] <theSantasquirrel> Yeah, I was just learning the concepts, I wish I had needed to use it more extensively.
[18:56:06] <SantasWiFi> damn thought I was done with log4j... phone system is vuln

[20:23:14] <ptaav> thanks.
[20:23:15] <vinrock> In North America, the terms 220V, 230V, and 240V all refer to the same system voltage level. However, 208V refers to a different system.
[20:23:16] <vinrock> In North America, the utility companies are required to deliver split phase 240VAC for residential use. That is two 120VAC (+/- 5 %) legs. With electrical loads, the voltage will drop, hence the common reference to voltages below 120 and 240, such as 110, 115, 220, and 230.
[20:23:16] <vinrock> The 208VAC system is not the same as 240VAC at all. It uses a "Y" style transformer with a neutral, and will yield 208VAC between two phases. It will however, provide 120VAC from hot to neutral.
[20:23:27] <vinrock> thats what im tryin to explain
[20:23:42] <Santax> i just got $100 cash for xmas...
[20:23:44] <Santax> yay
[20:23:44] <ptaav> i think he just needs an off the shelf ups
[20:23:48] <vinrock> when i hear people say '220v ups' it usualy means a 208v system here in NA
[20:24:00] <SantasWiFi> you guys know if theres a way to see what all interfaces are used to pass traffic from 2 different devices?
[20:24:02] <SantasWiFi> on cisco
[20:24:02] <Santax> vinrock: do you guys use 208 volt stuff?
[20:24:06] <vinrock> yeah
[20:24:10] <mrghostman> 208 is three phase
[20:24:11] <vinrock> i have a Symmetra RM here
[20:24:13] <vinrock> yup
[20:24:16] <vinrock> 3 phase 208v
[20:24:24] <Santax> I have 2 208 volt managed PDU's 
[20:24:26] <Santax> if you want
[20:24:33] <Santax> or need
[20:24:38] <Santax> i want them out of the basement. 
[20:24:42] <vinrock> appreciate the offer, but i go straight into a step converter to bring itdown to 110
[20:24:42] <ptaav> with standard ac power cord 
[20:24:47] <vinrock> so i wouldnt have a use for them
[20:24:54] <Santax> got ya
[20:24:56] <ptaav> i don't get why they mention 220v at all.
[20:24:59] <Santax> they have the 208 volt plug
[20:25:04] <vinrock> ptaav its just nomenclature
[20:30:49] <ptaav> looking at a picture of the plug makes more sense
[20:31:00] <ptaav> dryer outlet plug
[20:33:44] <vinrock> yup

[23:37:22] <bloody> ah its homeland security
[23:37:34] <signofzeta> They check a second identity document then push a button.
