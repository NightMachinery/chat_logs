[00:10:06] <bn_work> ajak: I'm not sure... depends on who you ask?  I don't think "old" anything is truly "unsupported", support-folks will always try to "help" to the limit of flat out of saying "hey, we no longer support version X"
[00:11:18] <bn_work> ajak: but there are newer versions of iOS, if that's what you're asking?  it's not always practical (or sometimes safe) to be on v(bleeding-edge) though

[01:10:02] <Hash> The event is simply a venue that the HackerX organization has provided to facilitate introductions between hiring companies and attendees. The event is invitation only so nearly every attendee has a good reason to be there. Attendees range from junior developers breaking into the tech industry to seasoned veterans surveying the market to keep their options open. For this reason, the room is full
[01:10:05] <Hash> of professionals who are worth chatting with and networking.

[04:31:48] <Joanna> Discord popularity kind of makes me wonder about what kinds of software people will accept. Just the gui is horrible and they don’t seem to notice ...
[04:32:05] <YoungChiefBTW> yall try [matrix]?

[04:39:04] <Hydragyrum> >discord inspects your computer to see what you have running< yes and for some of it makes it public to the world -- in the form of "game status"/"rich presence" they keep tabs on that

[07:10:05] <mathu> trying to use the NoPE plugin for BurpSuite to MITM traffic from an app. i've installed the BurpSuite CA and toggled a setting in the app to trust user-installed certs + disable TLS 1.3 and yet still BurpSuite reports it fails to establish a connection due to "unknown_ca". how can i debug?
[07:13:07] <MadCamel> debugging tls always sucks. I'd try MITMing a simple web browser to validate your burpsuite config first. It could be that the app is using certificate pinning. See if you can disassemble it enough to look for certificates in strings output.

[21:01:57] <catbeard> if you're only concerned about content, and only concerned that it DID change
[21:03:13] <catbeard> though in order for that to work, the page has to stay the same until the change
