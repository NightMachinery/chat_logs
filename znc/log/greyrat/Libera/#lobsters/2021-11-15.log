[01:46:53] <amazigh> but unlike a regular JIT compiler, it should be possible to do it in user code.
[01:47:31] <amazigh> which is sort of the case, when the compiler is part of the program.

[01:55:42] <amazigh> JIT compilers rely on heuristic that are known beforehand at the language level to guess what possible optimization might make sense at runtime, but the person that is in best position to know what optimization can be done is the developer of the program that must be the target of the optimization.
[01:56:00] <amazigh> atw: you replace a function definition at runtime, with an optimized definition.
[01:57:08] *** Quits: blindguard (~blindguar@2a02:908:1864:c200::12) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[01:57:16] <amazigh> What Nada Amin suggest, is to optimize very large programs (e.g. an emulator running in a sandbox), or very different evaluation strategies that are known to be slow.
[01:58:18] <amazigh> one AOT compilation constant folding, can not be applied eagerly for all code paths, unlike at runtime you know some values are come more often than others, in that case you may be able to apply constant folding yourself (maybe)
[01:59:24] <amazigh> that way you keep the program in memory size small (no drawback), but you still have the benefit of the optimization.
[02:00:41] <amazigh> atw: honestly, I just made a wild guess about how 3-lisp can be useful, and added meta/sum to sink, afaict, the next step for me would be make a compiler for kernel.

[13:42:19] <ignaloidas> eh, it speaks truth IMO
[13:42:20] <gthm> if my prototype in Python were too slow, I would simply refactor all my data structures, try a different Python implementation and hope and pray that PyPy runs my nonsense faster, and then write C and call that instead of my tire fire
[13:42:51] <epilys> why C :(
[13:42:53] * dacav claps in agreement
[13:42:55] <epilys> :C

[13:43:20] <gthm> (also I believe none of that, I'm summarizing the article)
[13:43:28] <ignaloidas> you just need a C abi after all
[13:44:00] <dacav> I'm a big fan of C.  Small, simple, no buttload of dependency
[13:44:15] <ignaloidas> it's worth noting that all of these steps besides the last one apply to other languages

[13:44:45] <dacav> if you don't know how to play the game, sure :D

[13:47:37] <iDrougge> > Small, simple, no buttload of dependency
[13:47:40] <iDrougge> Sounds like Javascript.
[13:47:52] <gthm> <3
[13:47:57] <dacav> XD
[13:48:18] <dacav> Enough making fun of languages that suck.  Let's talk about Javascript.
[13:48:43] <iDrougge> Let's just write our own leftpads.
[13:48:45] <epilys> It's not humanely possible to write safe C. It's that simple
[13:48:49] <dacav> hahahaha :D
[13:50:05] <steenuil> I've always found it amusing that C programmers would bring some implementation of strcat they copied from bsd decades ago along on every project
[13:50:06] <ignaloidas> epilys, there are specs for a safe subset of C
[13:50:15] <steenuil> but then I noticed I also do the same with JS, lol
[13:50:20] <riv> haha
[13:50:22] <riv> you have to
[13:50:38] <epilys> ignaloidas, just avoid C altogether unless your targets have only C compiler available
[13:50:53] <riv> even if you only have a c compiler, you can just use a safe language that targets c
[13:51:11] <ignaloidas> epilys, when the other option if fortran, it makes you think that C isn't that bad :)
[13:51:12] <epilys> transpiled? like?
[13:51:25] <iDrougge> That comes with its own set of problems.
[13:51:26] <riv> some scheme compilers do this, vala dose it
[13:51:27] <riv> does*
[13:51:29] <epilys> ignaloidas, oh boy. and I head fortran is still used around the world
[13:51:33] <epilys> hear*
[13:51:57] <ignaloidas> I heard that some HPC stuff is fortran because it compiles better than C
[13:52:26] <epilys> you can rephrase that as "they didn't bother optimizing the C version"
[13:52:30] <epilys> probably
[13:52:40] <gthm> I've only heard second-hand accounts of HPC things, but the ones I heard were in C++ and Java
[13:52:58] <iDrougge> Why bother optimising the C version if you can just skip C altogether?
[13:53:05] <steenuil> imo the point of using C is getting better control over your memory layout and all that, doesn't compiling a HLL to C kinda defeat that
[13:53:07] <epilys> Just don't run any code at all. Fast.

[13:53:49] <ignaloidas> epilys, nah, it had to do with the memory models, not sure how though

[15:24:06] <nikolap> I'm not sure what APL & J use for their linear algebra needs — I wouldn't be surprised if it had nothing to do with LAPACK & BLAS. they're certainly not the only libraries out there, but they are certainly among the most prevalent.
[15:24:44] <nikolap> I also can't imagine trying to teach APL to a bunch of physicists, as much as their Fortran & Python sometimes ends up resembling an APL program...
[15:25:22] <gerikson> I seem to remember BLAS being really close the metal
[15:25:26] <gerikson> maybe APL is too
[15:26:28] <nikolap> yup — I haven't looked into it too deeply, but more than a few BLAS implementations I've seen had a non-trivial amount of lines of assembly in there.
[15:33:01] <nikolap> also, when discussing possible reimplementations of BLAS, it's worth reading a couple of papers on parts of it, like `gemm` (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1356052.1356053)... while it's certainly not impossible, it's not really something one would want to do without a decent reason.

[16:34:50] <gthm> great minds think alike because as an undergrad teacher I once offered my class the choice of having their midterm linear algebra exam be a "normal" one with the usual problems, or a single 14x14 matrix that they had to figure out the kernel and image of and invert if possible

[18:31:53] <riv> things that we are well aware of as problems are literally not even on the radar for newcomers

[18:33:05] <Foxboron> wink: I know, that is not the point.
[18:33:10] <JordiGH> Other than the annoying feature of "every channel is like twenty different channels", I actually much prefer Discord UI to Slack. Well, I guess also because I'm only on three Slacks but I'm like on 60 discords.
[18:33:55] <wink> zbrown[m]: I still don't know what's that supposed to mean. Most people I know only switched because it was free and you had to self-host or pay for TS/mumble
[18:33:55] <zbrown[m]> riv: Most people have no idea this is the case IME
[18:33:59] <riv> the thing about discord is it couldn't even exist until web standards like webrtc and the ability to capture video and audio streams got to the point they are
[18:34:19] <wink> the vast minority uses it to screenshare or stuff

[18:35:44] <gerikson> as long as you have an account
[18:35:45] <wink> gerikson: they needed a client app. but if you want push to talk you also need that for discord
[18:35:50] <zbrown[m]> you no longer need to get someone onto your own server. You just tell them to join you in a discord room, click this link and they've already got the app
[18:36:06] <wink> the web thing is useless for audio
[18:36:12] <wink> or am I alon with that opinion
[18:36:20] <wink> I don't remember if I was ever not multitasking
[18:36:23] <gerikson> tbh I've never made a call in Discord

[19:40:13] <feoh> The article was written in a particular context and it's not clear to me that all of the respondents were clear on that context. Brent could also have maybe done a better job of establishing that as well

[20:13:20] <riv> What is it called when you use -1 to represent a failure, and positive numbers to represent themselves?
[20:13:57] <imode> sentinel?
[20:14:04] <riv> thanks!
[20:14:06] <imode> -1 is a sentinel value.
[20:14:19] <imode> i.e a specific value within the possible range of value used for signalling.
[20:14:47] <rhn> is it a sentinel though? I thought the sentinel was a specific value placed at the end of array to denote its end
[20:14:48] <wink> it's called a trap, for unknowing coworkers
[20:14:57] <iDrougge> riv: I think the technical term is "70s-style programming".

[20:17:20] <riv> is that rust?

[20:17:36] <riv> this is in C++
[20:17:41] <iDrougge> riv: I think it's from ML originally.
[20:17:42] <rhn> Result as the return type is what you want to look at
[20:17:56] <rhn> riv: std::variant and some enum class inside then
[20:17:59] <c355E3B> If you are in c++ riv, look at https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant
[20:18:00] <mockturtle> [ std::variant - cppreference.com ] - en.cppreference.com
[20:18:08] <riv> thanks!
[20:18:32] <c355E3B> We return those everywhere
[20:18:49] <c355E3B> So you either have a data frame, or an error which describes why you don't have a data frame
[20:18:52] <rhn> I suggest understanding the Rust version first, because a naked std::variant doesn't really tell you how to use it, unlike Rust's result
[20:19:00] <rhn> *Result

[20:20:12] <zbrown[m]> c++, such sadness
[20:20:13] <imode> riv: basically everyone here is trying to tell you to do something with the type system rather than pollute your value space, which I agree with if you can swing it.
[20:20:16] <companion_cube> c355E3B, rhn: how do you consume the variants, in your code?
[20:20:17] <ngoldbaum> not a fan of std::variant
[20:20:18] <c355E3B> If we are asking c++ questions, does anyone know if there is good documentation on RocksDB iterator upper bounds?
[20:20:20] <companion_cube> visit? or with if?
[20:20:27] <c355E3B> companion_cube: if? right now
[20:20:38] <ngoldbaum> like a lot of modern C++ stuff it got showhorned in with bad ergonomics or huge footguns
[20:21:01] <indigo> +1 I don't like std::variant and believe it should be used sparingly, if at all
[20:21:33] <riv> i'd like to know what you use instead when you say don't use something. Are you going back to using a sentinel value in most cases?
[20:21:39] <imode> riv: if you can't, or don't want to, don't worry about it. but keeping your value space clear of traps is good: it means that if you end up generating a -1 _legitimately_, for example, or propagate it from somewhere you don't expect, you won't blow the whole codebase up.
[20:21:42] <companion_cube> I believe C++ should add actual sum types
[20:21:54] <riv> is the variant different to a sum type?
[20:21:55] <rhn> companion_cube: I didn't really use it extensively, but I'd have wrapped them in some class and have clearly named methods for accessing the alternatives
[20:22:19] <companion_cube> rhn: ah makes sense
[20:22:20] <imode> variant is a type-safe union.
[20:22:23] <ngoldbaum> c++ add pattern matching when
[20:22:24] <companion_cube> probably the cleanest way, heh?
[20:22:37] <iDrougge> I believe C++ should add nothing at all. Adding is what gave us C++ to begin with-.
[20:22:37] <imode> I think what you want, riv, is something akin to an Option or something.
[20:22:39] <indigo> riv: Nah, just use absl::StatusOr
[20:22:51] <companion_cube> iDrougge: sometimes adding stuff can simplify
[20:22:54] <indigo> Or you can use exceptions but I hate exceptions
[20:22:58] <imode> something can fail, and you wanna be able to handle that failure.
[20:22:59] <companion_cube> at least, simplify the users' code
[20:23:04] <iDrougge> Obviously C++ hasn't simplified anything.

[20:23:16] <mockturtle> [ std::optional - cppreference.com ] - en.cppreference.com
[20:23:26] <companion_cube> well it simplified some things compared to C, didn't it?
[20:23:28] <imode> if your only other type is integers, why use a variant.
[20:23:39] <imode> "this thing is valid or not".
[20:23:39] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: it’s hard to simplify things while also keeping huge spaces of the language undefined for historical reasons *and* not bread any old code

[22:50:22] <varjag> especially when you use an unstenciled us kbd
[22:51:37] <JordiGH> You use the dash in Russian for similar effect, don't you?
[22:52:34] <varjag> i don't
[22:52:43] <varjag> but then i don't use the 'russian smiley'
[22:53:13] <varjag> a proper iso smiley is wtg

[23:33:07] <JordiGH> I think for example Lithuania can charge you with a crime if you walk around with a hammer and sickle?

[23:33:36] <JordiGH> I once went on a date with a Latvian girl.
[23:33:47] <JordiGH> I figured, hey, she must know some Russian, let me show off my knowledge.
[23:33:59] <varjag> heh
[23:34:17] <JordiGH> She told me a story of how when she was young girl, the Russian soldiers would tell her that they couldn't understand her bitch language, to speak Russian instead.

[23:35:24] <JordiGH> There was no second date.
[23:35:42] <technomancy> you'll hear the same stories from people speaking their native language in occupied California
[23:35:47] <varjag> i think they phrased it more idiomatically but yeah
[23:36:28] <varjag> fun thing is like 25% of latvia population are ethnic russians who for the most part hate latvians guts
[23:36:45] <varjag> but in the west both are known as latvians based on their passports
[23:36:56] <wink> JordiGH: depends which country I guess. from Georgia (sample size: 1) it soudned "well we speak it" and ukrainer more like "ofc we speak it"
[23:36:58] <varjag> that leads to some confusion
[23:37:13] <JordiGH> wink: I've heard Ukranians get pissy about speaking Russian too.
[23:37:15] <edk> varjag: well, i as a westerner am aware of the difference because i've spoken to latvians before
[23:37:17] <edk> it's not hard
[23:37:19] <JordiGH> Not all of them, but I have heard some stories.
[23:37:44] <JordiGH> varjag: It was specifically about dogs.
[23:38:07] <varjag> сучий язык then
[23:38:08] <JordiGH> I am trying to remember exactly how she phrased it, but it wasn't "bitch" as in the non-dog English meaning of "bitch".
[23:38:18] <varjag> but it's too soft expression for soldiers fwiw
[23:38:32] <wink> JordiGH: yeah dunno. the 2 ukrainians I know had no problem using russian all the time, both in their late 30s
[23:39:30] <varjag> yeah you can speak russian in ukraine no prob
[23:39:51] <varjag> tho the trend shifts to majority ukrainian speech now
