[00:13:45] <int-e> ...let's hope it wasn't a disjunction...
[00:14:02] <mycroftiv> i spent many years thinking that the definition of the empty set as 'the set that contains nothing' meant there was a separate Nothing formal object from the empty set itself
[00:14:25] <mycroftiv> and thus endlessly confused the null set with the singleton set containing the null set reading math
[00:15:13] <Z-module> mycroftiv: I once spent a long, frustrating couple of hours trying to convince an economics grad student (who lived in my building) that {} and {{}} are not the same set. I don't think I convinced him.
[00:15:42] <Z-module> Of course he was totally unaware of ZF or similar axioms.
[00:16:14] <Z-module> but he was a great guy to know anyway.
[00:16:17] <mycroftiv> z-module: the comparison to how, in computer programming, some people can never learn the difference between 0, the 0 index of an array, a pointer to an array that contains a 0 value, and a pointer to the 0 index of computer memory, is very close i think

[00:37:17] <isekaijin> That “b \ne 0” hypothesis is you working around the fact that type inference is not doing its supposed job.
[00:37:48] <int-e> (It's a design choice. You /could/ leave x/0 unspecified, but it will have *some* value, so for example 1/0 - 1/0 = 0 will be provable. With x/0 = 0 you get more unconstrained theorems, which help for automation.)
[00:38:08] <isekaijin> But, in all fairness, what you really need to say is that the units of a ring form a subset of the ring.
[00:38:11] <int-e> You /could/ also have partial functions but then you lose even more automation support.

[00:42:35] <isekaijin> Well, supposedly the “modern” point of view is that mathematics can be the study of the consequences of an arbitrary internally consistent system of axioms... that's very much a nihilist point of view that can only be explained by modern cultural disease.

[00:45:40] <isekaijin> p-i-: I'm not sure how you expect math (never mind ##math) to help you here. Do you have some sort of model of how “packing signals into websockets” (whatever that is) influences the “expected latency of transmission”?
[00:46:33] <isekaijin> p-i-: If you have that model, then *maybe* (depending on how tractable that model is) we could help. And if you don't have that model, well, constructing that model is an extra-mathematical activity.

[00:53:03] <isekaijin> Mmm.
[00:53:40] <p-i-> The first challenge for me is to extract a clean question. Some way to see the problem more clearly.
[00:55:04] <p-i-> If I had 16 elements, and box-size=4 I could: [0123 4567 89ab cdef] then [01.. 23.. 56.. 67..] and fill in those .. by continuing, to get [0189 23ab 56cd 67ef]
[00:55:48] <p-i-> And then [0... 1... 2... 3...] which would end up as [048c 159d 26ae 37bf]

[01:11:01] <p-i-> I suppose if x were 2D points then a rot180, hflip, vflip would be the only functions s.t. f(f(x)) = x
[01:11:37] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: Mmm, the problem that I see with the “obvious” transliteration of “surjective” into type theory is that type theory's existential quantifier is much more powerful than classical logic's existential quantifier.

[01:14:27] <mycroftiv> constructive bijection is interconvertible with voevodsky equivalence and with invertible/isomorphic function pairs

[01:14:45] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: Wait, where's the truncation there?
[01:15:32] <isekaijin> RadSurfer: Scalar multiplication times the inverse of the constant.

[01:15:59] <mycroftiv> or implemented as higher inductive types in something like cubical agda computational univalence
[01:16:35] <goost1> Agda seems interesting :O

[03:08:26] <ALowther> Arggg, I don't know how to make the understanding intuitive
[03:10:05] <ALowther> What about this? Is this coincidental or does this also work as an explanation? The first die can land on either a 1 or a 3. That's a probability of 2/6 or 1/3. The second die then HAS to be whichever the first one wasn't, which is a 1/6 chance. The chance that the 2nd die lands on that after the first die lands on whatever is does is 1/3 * 1/6, which is 1/18

[03:23:38] <confuzius> ALowther: would your approach work for finding the probability that both were even?
[03:24:46] <ALowther> confuzius: Well both are independent in that case. In the case one needing to be 1 and one needing to be 3, their relationship is dependent.
[03:28:37] <confuzius> what about odd and evens?
[03:29:42] <ALowther> Same thing. It's not dependent. Unless you are asking the odds that one will be even and one will be odd. In that case, but since there are 3 of each, the odds that it's even or odd would be 1/3 either way, so I don't know that that would be a good example to demonstrate with.
[03:31:02] <isekaijin> ALowther: This looks good to me: “The second die then HAS to be whichever the first one wasn't”.
[03:31:18] <confuzius> odds and evens will be similar to your original question?
[03:31:44] <confuzius> oops, ignore
[03:31:57] <isekaijin> ALowther: So, after this explanation, your calculation (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/18 is correct.

[03:39:26] <ALowther> Well. There are 3 even numbers. So there's a 1/3 chance that we land an even number on the first roll. Then, if we landed one, there are two evens left, so a 2/5 chance to get one of the other two. 1/3 * 2/5 = 2/15 chance to roll two different even numbers.

[03:40:32] <ALowther> 1/2 * 1/3
[03:40:44] <ALowther> 1/6
[03:42:10] <ALowther> We start with the chance to roll 3 out of 6 numbers, or 1/2. Then we remove one of those as an option, whichever even one we rolled(assuming we did), which leaves us 2 out of 6 or 1/3 for the 2nd roll.
[03:42:33] <isekaijin> ALowther: Yes, (3/6) * (2/6) = (1/2) * (1/3) works.
[03:44:15] <ALowther> I'm still having trouble with understanding the other approach for #5 here, https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/High_School_Mathematics_Extensions/Discrete_Probability#Exercises
[03:44:30] <ALowther> The solution says P(A = 1) × P(C = 3) + P(A = 3) × P(C = 1) = 1/36 + 1/36 = 1/18
[03:46:38] <isekaijin> That's my original approach.
[03:46:59] <isekaijin> I am guessing that A and C stand for the outcomes of the first and second rolls, respectively.
[03:47:19] <ALowther> Oh, I see what they've done. They've broken it up into both scenarios. The probability of die 1(A) = 1 and then die 2(C) = 3. Which is dependent, so 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36. Then, the other possible scenario where die 1(A) = 3 and die 2(C) = 1, again 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36. Then since those are both possibilities they are added together. 1/36 + 1/36 = 1/18
[03:47:26] <isekaijin> Yeah.
[03:47:57] <ALowther> Guess I just had to talk that one out. Thanks for letting me hog the chat and for all of your thoughts.

[03:49:14] <ALowther> Is it safe to apply the logical terms AND and OR to these situations. When something is an AND, the probabilities are multiplicative, when it's an OR, they are additive.

[08:36:59] <xx> I have a practical mathematics question. I want to buy a set of weight plates. I want to cover all masses from 0kg to 48.75kg in 1.25kg increments. I can cover that range using those plates: 1x25kg 1x10kg 2x5kg 1x2.5kg 1x1.25kg.
[08:37:07] <xx> here's my python script to show that https://0x0.st/ozCq.bin
[08:37:37] <xx> so why are they selling plate sets that contain the following plates: 1x25kg 1x20kg 1x15kg 1x10kg 1x5kg 1x2.5kg 1x1.25kg?
[08:38:06] <xx> it's more expensive and creates unnecessary combinations
[08:40:05] <p-i-> I'm sure a few powerlifters flunked math. One of them made a product line...
[08:40:26] <xx> but... every company seems to be selling a set that contains those exact plates
[08:40:44] <xx> is it just them being bad at math, or trying to make people buy stuff they don't need (to make more money) or am I missing something?

[08:42:29] <mycroftiv> xx: it is them correctly assessing the market is not good enough at math to analyze as you have

[08:43:02] *** Joins: darkapex (~darkapex@user/darkapex)
[08:43:08] <p-i-> Don't you also want the ability to balance both ends of a bar?
[08:43:23] <xx> well, yeah, so just multiply my set by two
[08:44:08] <xx> (and yeah, they too are actually selling 2x25 2x20 2x15 2x10 2x5 2x2.5 2x1.25 I just made the numbers simpler)
[08:45:02] *** Quits: sheepduck (~sheepduck@user/sheepduck) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[08:45:12] <xx> arguably, I don't know anything about weight lifting (just making a new year resolution to get into it), so maybe I need to find a good place to ask this, but the numbers still look weird
[08:45:30] <xx> like, my numbers look fine, and I don't get why they'd sell a nonsensical plate set
[08:45:47] <p-i-> They might also factor in that some powerlifters may lack the math to figure out asymmetrical disjoint subsets that balance, e.g. [25+2.5 : 20+5+2.5]
[08:46:14] <mycroftiv> xx: remember the 1/3rd pound burger failed marketing because too many consumers thoight 1/3 < 1/4
[08:46:30] <xx> mycroftiv: yeah I heard about that, but still find it hard to believe that that was actually true
[08:46:49] <mycroftiv> you really cant overestimate the degree to which people are going to fail numeracy
[08:48:42] <mycroftiv> so 'why consumers dont demand properly combinatorially optimized weight sets' is answered by 'combina-wha?' and honestly most people have more important issues in life so im not sneering

[08:50:00] <p-i-> humanity is a seeding phase for AI anyway
[08:50:21] <int-e> there's also the dumb commercial reason that waste is profitable
[08:50:44] <cherim> Where does the 48.75 limit come from?
[08:50:51] <p-i-> It's only ego that makes people think they are the finished product of the cosmos
[08:50:52] <xx> int-e: not exactly great for the environment, both in terms of overproduction and transportation of said mass

[08:52:07] <xx> heh
[08:52:10] <mycroftiv> p-i- : we are  the product of the cosmos at this exact moment, and its in our nature to wish to survive and perpetuate ourselves, because life does that, so im hoping for collaboration with our future robot overlords
[08:52:20] <cherim> Why don't you stop at 10 then, and add 10s?
[08:52:40] <xx> cherim: you can fit more 25kg plates on the limited space on the bar than 10kg plates
[08:52:50] <xx> (width is the issue)
[08:52:55] <p-i-> mycroftiv: be seein' you at the queue for the neuralink then
[08:53:30] <xx> hmm
[08:53:44] <xx> I think I'm starting to see the reason behind it, but it will be irrelevant to most lifters
[08:53:44] <cherim> Maybe having 15 and 20 allows for smaller widths at some weights as well?
[08:53:50] <mycroftiv> p-i-: maybe if programmers learn to be about 100x more careful about things, im not ready for cognitive bugs like i see in all code
[08:54:24] <mycroftiv> i just wrote http://wiki.9gridchan.org/incoming/mycro/agdahtml/HarmonicUltrafilter.html about some related issues actually, its kinda far out and crankish though i warn ya
[08:54:29] <xx> yeah, once you add 4x25kg plates on each side, you don't have the space to add 10+5+2.5+1.25kg plates anyway, so that's where the 15kg plate would be useful
[08:54:33] <xx> and similarly with 20kg plate

[08:54:46] <xx> but none of that is relevant for a starter set of plates that they are selling
[08:54:54] <p-i-> But life seeks to evolve, not to perpetuate. It is a flowering. Replication with mutation has so far been the best strategy on this planet, but that's gona change.
[08:55:23] <int-e> anyway I find this interesting but it's more about commerce than math... maybe ##math-offtopic?
[08:56:01] <p-i-> Locally it appears as a desire to perpetuate, but only in the way that locally a spherical surface appears flat.
[08:56:02] <xx> that's ok, thanks for checking that I am not totally insane :)
[08:58:31] <p-i-> Yes, also if the balancing at 2 ends of a bar is asymmetric, it's gona shift the center of mass and e.g. introduce wrist strain if you grip the center of a short bar.

[11:13:58] <whatsupdoc> i meant a smooth, continuous line

[11:14:03] <greenbagels> ah ok
[11:14:07] <whatsupdoc> I thin it should be true

[11:14:24] <whatsupdoc> But I can't prove
[11:14:27] <whatsupdoc> it
[11:15:22] <greenbagels> you're basically suggesting that, for any function f(x) differentiable at points a, b, that (f(b)-f(a)) / (b-a) = f'(b) + f'(a)
[11:16:23] <greenbagels> I think you can come up with easy counterexamples to even this

[22:52:29] <Z-module> It has 4 distinct complex roots, not necessarily real? and now by "largest" do you mean largest absolute value?

[22:54:40] <toron> it has 4 distinct complex roots, and either 2 or 4 real roots. I know one of the real roots. I want the largest real root in the sense of the most positive
[22:55:03] <toron> No, I just want to check whether my root is the largest or not. I don't need to find the largest.
[22:55:55] <Z-module> I see

[22:57:15] <Z-module> Let r mean the real root you know. If f'(x) > 0 for all x > r,  then r is the largest.
[22:57:41] <toron> yes
[22:57:56] <toron> but not iff, correct?
[22:58:25] <Z-module> right: the graph could go up, bend back down and then up forever, without ever hitting 0 again to the right of r
[22:58:34] <toron> I might have the largest real root of two, and f might wiggle to the right of that root
[22:58:37] <toron> yes

[23:01:27] <Z-module> Not sure there are any shortcuts you can use, really.
[23:01:53] <toron> thanks for taking the time to look at it!
[23:02:02] <Z-module> Check the number of "sign changes in both f(x) and f(-x), to use with Descartes' Rule of Signs.
[23:04:52] <isekaijin> toron: If the graph goes up, bends back down, and then goes up again, all while not crossing the x axis, then your polynomial must have at least one pair of complex roots.

[23:31:25] <Z-module> The "devil's staircase" AKA Cantor function.
[23:31:35] <Z-module> well, it's smooth almost everywhere.
[23:32:32] <Z-module> but non-differentiable (even once) at all points of the Cantor set. And its length is exactly 2, which is very strange for a continuous monotonic function [0,1] -> [0,1]
[23:34:23] <Z-module> An everywhere differentiable such function must have length < 2
[23:36:06] <Z-module> (as I know from my take-home final exam in undergrad real analysis)
[23:36:25] <Decker> So - rotation matrices - I can just multiply them?  https://i.ibb.co/dM0HZvN/image.png  That's what everything I read tells me, but I end up with a marix that sends two coodinates to 0
[23:36:37] <Decker> is there a rodrigues rotation for matrices?
[23:37:32] <greenbagels> Decker: in general, linear transformations can be encoded via matrices, and composition of transformations corresponds to multiplication of matrices
[23:37:55] <greenbagels> so yes, sequences of rotations arej ust products of rotation matrices
[23:37:55] <Decker> R=I+(sinTheta)K+(1-cosTheta)K^2 ?
[23:39:05] <Decker> (no that's something else)
[23:40:07] <Decker> okay - then why's it fail so bad?  I don't have ancient code I don't think - there was something I was doing - but then it was only 1 rotation composition ( of 2) but really ... that's all this is too; it's certainly no longer a det()=1 matrix
