[00:43:03] <jlindgren> mondays go so quick up until 3pm. then the last 2hrs drag.
[00:43:07] <jlindgren> ytho
[00:44:24] <manicennui> We have today off.
[00:44:48] <manicennui> Because Americans feel bad about murdering a black guy, but not bad enough to actually fix anything.
[00:45:38] <Geekingfrog> it's pretty modern, pretend to care, make a display of it for a day, and proceed to ignore it the other 364 days
[00:50:10] <jlindgren> sounds about right
[00:50:20] <kline> america has always been performative
[00:50:53] <kline> what does yeeting tea into boston harbour do, really?
[00:51:35] <epilys> poison marine life?
[00:53:33] <Geekingfrog> prevent some ppl to get even richer selling it ?
[01:02:06] <manicennui> kline: It wasn't their tea.
[01:02:39] <manicennui> "Protesters, some disguised as American Indians, destroyed an entire shipment of tea sent by the East India Company."
[01:03:06] <kline> manicennui, correct
[01:03:09] <kline> what of it?
[01:03:10] <manicennui> Basically East India Company didn't have to pay taxes.
[01:03:12] <manicennui> And everyone else did.
[01:03:21] <manicennui> So the colonists said, "Fuck yo tea!"
[01:04:21] <kline> right, but its inherently performative, dumping something like 1% of 1% of 1% of 1% of the EICs profit
[01:04:29] <manicennui> Sure.
[01:04:37] <manicennui> It wasn't the only thing that happened.
[01:04:45] <kline> i think youre taking this too seriously
[01:04:52] <manicennui> Symbols are sometimes important.
[01:04:59] <manicennui> Too seriously?
[01:05:03] <manicennui> I'm just describing what happened.
[01:05:35] <kline> i was just joking about the tea party being performative virtue signalling
[01:05:47] <kline> everyone knows that really it was a pivotal moment
[01:06:02] <manicennui> The difference is, it led to something.
[01:06:21] <manicennui> Arguably, the civil rights movement of the 60s didn't ultimately achieve much other than a bunch of them being killed.
[01:06:29] <manicennui> We still have most of the same problems today.
[01:06:46] <manicennui> And Republicans continue to try to disenfranchise black people, and are often successful.
[01:07:55] <manicennui> Not a whole lot has changed since George Floyd either.
[01:08:21] <manicennui> More people acknowledge Juneteenth. There has been very minimal police reform.
[01:08:32] <manicennui> A couple of bad cops went to jail.
[01:08:59] <manicennui> They should organize a massive strike.
[01:09:08] <manicennui> It is the only thing that the people in power really fear.
[01:09:37] <manicennui> It would have to last a while though.
[01:09:52] <manicennui> And it would have to be a significant portion of the workforce.

[05:16:03] <manicennui> The one bro bought it, and then their DAO bought it from him essentially.
[05:16:09] <manicennui> And the last one sold for something like $45k.

[05:55:00] <manicennui> One of these hallowed Dune books sold for $42500 in 2019. And on the 22nd November this year another sold but this time it went for $3 Million dollars. All thanks to one man stepping in and buying it on behalf of a collective who at that point had managed to raise $750,000 dollars. (As of today that amount has topped $11M).
[05:55:09] <drakonis> this is insane

[06:20:27] <drakonis> yo this is horrid
[06:22:29] <manicennui> drakonis: Yeah, he seems to believe that collecting shit is like the most important part of culture.
[06:22:43] <manicennui> And also doesn't realize that he just gave millions to a single guy for a book.
[06:22:57] <manicennui> Which is kind of the opposite of redistributing wealth.
[06:23:00] <drakonis> he's trying to justify nfts by talking about uhh
[06:23:06] <drakonis> *checks notes* the medici family
[06:23:24] <drakonis> this guy is so stoned
[06:23:25] <manicennui> He throws out all kinds of references that he has read like two sentences about.

[09:49:33] <manicennui> I'm totally shocked!
[09:50:00] <manicennui> The economists estimated that $115 billion to $175 billion in PPP loans went toward paychecks, meaning that only 23% to 34% of PPP funds went directly to workers who would otherwise have lost jobs.
[09:50:14] <manicennui> Where did the rest go? The remaining 66% to 77% went to business owners and stakeholders, including shareholders, creditors, and suppliers.
[09:50:31] <manicennui> The authors also estimated that the program spent $170,000 to $257,000 per job-year saved.

[17:28:38] <gwozniak> gthm: this is the wisest course of action
[18:05:53] <gwozniak> My team has a job posting up and we aren't getting any applicants.  I have some guesses as to why, but I'm looking for some other feedback.  If anything about this stands out, I'd appreciate some notes: https://careers.microchip.com/job/5356/principal_engineer_embedded_compiler
[18:05:54] <buttsbot> Principal Engineer-Embedded Compiler
[18:06:08] <gwozniak> Note that I don't write these things and actually have little to no input on them
[18:07:17] <gwozniak> But after they have been up for a while, things change...
[18:10:03] <Geekingfrog> What's a "situationally junior engineer" ?
[18:11:27] <Brekkjern> Every one of us
[18:11:48] <gwozniak> I'm guessing just "junior engineer" with an unnecessary adjective
[18:13:40] <Geekingfrog> I know very little about this field, so the list of qualifications seems a bit daunting but perhaps it's ok. The one big missing thing is some idea of salary. The bit about remote work but in office at least once a month is slightly weird (rules out ppl too far away) but I can understand that.
[18:14:39] <Brekkjern> I would wonder if traveling to the office for that once a month meeting would be covered too
[18:15:39] <Brekkjern> Also, this seems like a rather niche role, so I doubt you'd get all that many qualified applicants to begin with. Should probably try to reach out to someone in the field.
[18:15:48] <gwozniak> These are all the things I wonder about too.  In particular the odd remote stuff
[18:16:44] <gwozniak> Yes, it's pretty specialized.  And Microchip is not known for being a compiler company, so it's hard to get seasoned compiler devs attention
[18:16:44] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[18:17:44] <gwozniak> We're mostly doing the job posting because we've contacted all our contacts with no luck
[18:18:04] <gwozniak> I fully expect the requirements to be loosened soon
[18:18:17] <gwozniak> Anyone want to learn compiler stuff? ;)
[18:19:05] <Brekkjern> Eh, maybe? :P
[18:19:17] <Brekkjern> But I want to learn everything, so...
[18:19:30] <gwozniak> I suspect that being in the US or Canada will be a requirement
[18:19:38] <Brekkjern> Likely
[18:19:51] <Brekkjern> I don't plan on being any of those places in the near future, so
[18:20:00] <gwozniak> Since the point is to be on the team I'm on...
[18:20:01] <Brekkjern> Not that I was being serious either :P
[18:20:12] <gwozniak> I gathered that ;)
[18:20:42] <Brekkjern> Good. Didn't want to get your hopes up and then crush them later :P
[18:21:07] <gwozniak> Another thing is that Toronto is the hub for compiler people in Canada, and there are lots of other, more glamorous jobs in the area for compiler people
[18:24:06] <gwozniak> I bet we'd take someone on the east coast of the US if they applied, though

[19:34:26] <manicennui> Love how anything you buy online now leads to being spammed by that company, perhaps even trying to convince you to buy the thing you just bought.
[19:37:33] <prussian> SaaSify the world.
[19:38:09] <manicennui> Years ago I thought that I wanted to get into content marketing. Now I hate myself for even thinking that.
[19:38:26] <drakonis> lol microsoft owns gaming
[19:39:16] <riv> its wild thinking about when xbox was invented

[19:39:27] <buttsbot> You are not entitled to play games or buy platforms. It is a net negative for th... | Hacker News
[19:39:29] <riv> we were all thinking what ajoke , it'll fail etc.
[19:39:47] <manicennui> riv: Helps that they plowed billions into it for years while it was failing.
[19:39:54] <riv> yes!
[19:40:17] <riv> I want to try the halo games at some point, the story with cortana seems interesting
[19:40:42] <prussian> That's ok, I just won't play nonfree (software) games.
[19:40:44] <prussian> simple as.
[19:41:52] <manicennui> Maybe MS can buy Valve next.
[19:42:18] <manicennui> Can't have too many options out there.
[19:43:09] <prussian> beautiful.
[19:43:17] <prussian> wonder how much ms maid on minecrap
[19:43:39] <manicennui> A fuckton.
[19:44:09] <manicennui> It is the most popular video game of all time and has been ported to absolutely everything.
[19:44:15] <riv> yeah it is frustrating
[19:44:20] <riv> it's all about renting now
[19:44:32] <riv> for the majority, you don't own games anymore
[19:44:48] <riv> you buy a subscription that lets you play some constantly shifting library of games
[19:45:00] <riv> it's weird for me but I think the younger generation are used to it
[19:45:57] <gwozniak> It is certainly more convenient than having a bunch of games around
[19:46:11] <gwozniak> Same reason streaming movies is more convenient
[19:46:14] <riv> yeah
[19:46:24] <riv> I still have game boxes from the 90s
[19:46:31] <riv> i wonder if people on ebay want them or something
[19:46:42] <manicennui> When is Costco going to start acquiring everyone to fulfill the prophecy?
[19:46:47] <companion_cube> old game boxes might also be locked because the key server is down
[19:46:51] <companion_cube> for 2000s-era games
[19:46:55] <riv> oh this is before key servers :)
[19:47:01] <riv> this is when you had your own license code
[19:47:05] <riv> shareware
[19:47:19] <riv> sometimes they had entire books of codes
[19:47:29] <riv> and you had to look through them each time you start the game
[19:47:39] <companion_cube> hmm right, the game didn't have to connect to the net to check keys
[19:47:47] <companion_cube> makes sense when connections were time metered
[19:48:08] <manicennui> Or before the commercial Internet was a thing.
[19:48:10] <riv> (lemmings for example https://www.camanis.net/lemmings/onmlcpcodes.php and prince of persia too)
[19:48:10] <buttsbot> Oh No! More Lemmings Copy-protection Codes - The Lemmings Archive
[19:48:17] <manicennui> Lemmings!
[19:48:28] <riv> I think for prince of persia it would ask you what is the letter on page 25, line 5 word 7 of the manual
[19:48:59] <manicennui> They did all kinds of interesting things in those days.
[19:49:17] <manicennui> Including floppies that were corrupt in a way that they couldn't be copied, but the installer could deal with it.
[19:49:41] <gwozniak> I have one of those consoles for playing retro games and it... sucks.  Nothing displays correctly.  I had it for years and didn't use it.  I tried playing Super Mario Bros. and Zelda 2.  It was not good.
[19:50:04] <manicennui> gwozniak: Can't you just buy those games from the store on the Switch?
[19:50:11] <riv> gwozniak: something other than a rpi?
[19:50:18] <riv> I think rpi with MAME/MESS will work well
[19:50:36] <gwozniak> I play about once every 10 years, so getting a Switch account is not worth it
[19:50:44] <riv> emulation is annoying as hell. It's usually possible to get it working well but it takes *time* to set up
[19:51:35] <gwozniak> Plus, I don't care enough to bother.  I honestly fired it up for the hell of it.
[19:51:49] <gwozniak> I haven't played a video game in a long time
[19:52:00] <manicennui> I wish I could stop.
[19:52:20] <gwozniak> Aside from the incidental playing that happens when I visit my friends and their kids want to play
[19:52:20] <manicennui> I think I just need to fill my time with other things.
[19:52:33] <manicennui> Otherwise I default to just doing things like playing Overwatch and watching television.
[19:53:14] <gwozniak> If Zelda 2 worked, I might have tried to play it through.  Since it doesn't, I'll just pack it away and forget about it
[19:53:40] <gwozniak> I get no real joy from video games, really
[19:53:56] <manicennui> I generally don't either.
[19:53:59] <manicennui> It is more of a habit.
[19:54:13] <manicennui> And I have a hard time getting into other games.
[19:55:08] <gwozniak> riv: I have no idea what the console is running with.  It takes physical cartridges (and controllers) for NES, SNES, or Sega Genesis.
[19:55:15] <riv> woah
[19:55:23] <gwozniak> Which, yes, I do have
[19:55:24] <riv> maybe it's some FPGA based thing, i'm not sure
[19:56:16] <gwozniak> It's cheaply made.  The cartridge wobbles easily and getting it to sit in there correctly is a bit of a game.  It's also really hard to remove.

[19:56:32] <manicennui> Sheesh.
[19:56:43] <gwozniak> It was a gift from a cousin years ago.  I've played it twice now.
[19:59:51] <gwozniak> It sits near the television, collecting dust
[20:01:17] <manicennui> Glad I don't receive gifts.
[20:02:52] <manicennui> I want to write songs like Ride Like the Wind.
[20:03:30] <manicennui> Like an adult contemporary song about having to fight in prison.
[20:04:37] <manicennui> Wow. A song about Boyka.
[20:04:41] <manicennui> That would be amazing.
[20:05:55] <riv> I think another thing about huel is, you really gotta be hungry to get it in you
[20:06:10] <riv> which disincentives having snacks during the day
[20:06:15] <manicennui> I feel like Yacht Rock is what happens when talented musicians use drugs responsibly and don't fuck up their lives.

[20:11:30] <manicennui> I see.
[20:11:47] <prussian> sounds like some dystopic hellscape of a future.
[20:11:49] <imode> can we just destroy the earth already.
[20:11:51] <Geekingfrog> :D
[20:11:56] <manicennui> imode: We are working on it.

[20:11:56] <Geekingfrog> where do I sign ?
[20:12:08] <imode> how's that for a dystipic hellscape.
[20:12:13] <imode> *dystopic
[20:12:13] <prussian> sounds about right though
[20:12:14] <manicennui> imode: God only created animals to get to plastic.
[20:12:24] <imode> paperclip optimization working well, I see.
[20:12:25] <prussian> i'm assuming it's all in the ocean too
[20:12:26] <Geekingfrog> next in the news: plastic is becoming sentient, mammals on the verge of extinction
[20:12:31] <imode> good.
[20:12:42] <imode> attack the billionaires and industry.
[20:12:50] <imode> reset us pre-industrial revolution.

[20:13:09] <companion_cube> imode: good luck with spending all your day farming
[20:13:49] <imode> that didn't happen.
[20:13:58] <manicennui> companion_cube: I'd be happy to.
[20:14:00] <imode> well, it did, but it didn't happen in the excess you think it did.
[20:14:05] <imode> and I'd be happy to anyway.
[20:14:22] <companion_cube> I'd rather not, personally
[20:14:28] <companion_cube> also I like modern medicine
[20:14:32] <imode> because you grew up and have a lifestyle that allows you not to.
[20:14:32] <Geekingfrog> I read somewhere that the medieval peasan had more holiday and days off than us nowadays
[20:14:34] <kl1n3> i wonder if plastic exists in nature
[20:14:38] <kl1n3> like
[20:14:40] <manicennui> companion_cube: Those things aren't mutually exclusive.
[20:14:45] <kl1n3> you get diesel just chilling out on titan
[20:14:45] <imode> modern medicine doesn't go away because we're pre-industrial.
[20:14:54] <kl1n3> why not other complex compounds?
[20:15:11] <companion_cube> manicennui: modern medicine requires industrialization.
[20:15:15] <imode> it really doesn't.
[20:15:29] <companion_cube> how do you build an IRM machine with artisan tools?
[20:15:33] <companion_cube> MRI*
[20:15:45] <kl1n3> companion_cube, isnt that how they made the first one?
[20:15:46] <companion_cube> how do you make mRNA vaccines, even?
[20:15:57] <imode> how do you build a single MRI machine. or a nuclear reactor.
[20:16:00] <companion_cube> lol, that was way after industrialization
[20:16:18] <imode> not as far as you'd think. nuclear piles were pretty easy to build.
[20:17:02] <imode> I can't believe I'm arguing for the Interstellar future of Earth lmao.
[20:17:03] <companion_cube> I'm sorry, are you talking about some nuclear tech before 1945?
[20:17:30] <imode> yeah.
[20:17:32] <kl1n3> companion_cube, nuclear reactors exist in nature
[20:17:32] <imode> CP1.
[20:17:36] <Geekingfrog> question for the native speakers there: what does "and then add some more useful advice for forrestthewoods at the end" means? I'm confused by the word forrestthewoods in this context
[20:17:37] <imode> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Pile-1
[20:17:37] <buttsbot> Chicago Pile-1 - Wikipedia
[20:17:41] <companion_cube> kl1n3: not usable ones though
[20:17:49] <imode> 1942 in fact. :P
[20:17:53] <companion_cube> lol ok
[20:18:04] <companion_cube> note that 1942 is way, way into the industrialized age.
[20:18:20] <manicennui> Steam is the future!
[20:18:21] <kl1n3> companion_cube, point is you could in practice just mine suitably rich uranium out the ground and put it in a heap and it gets warm enough to harvest energy from
[20:18:41] <companion_cube> also you die of radiation poisoning
[20:18:49] <kl1n3> its not going to be as useful as our highly tuned and efficient modern processes, but non-industrial nuclear power generation does exist
[20:18:56] <imode> put it to you this way. with the knowledge we have _now_, curated and preserved, blast yourself back to the pre-industrial era.
[20:18:57] <companion_cube> we also can't go back to early industrial age
[20:19:05] <companion_cube> because all the easily accessible coal is mined
[20:19:18] <manicennui> companion_cube: I'd actually argue for something quite different, where we do industrialize to some extent, but nothing like what we have now. It would take longer to get to certain things, but I think a great deal of what we have now is not worth having, and causes many of the problems that we then have to solve.
[20:19:20] <companion_cube> imode: we could do better than them, yes.
[20:19:24] <companion_cube> but not as good as we're dong.
[20:19:31] <manicennui> companion_cube: Sure we can. Just not with this many people.
[20:19:41] <companion_cube> ah well
[20:19:52] <companion_cube> we might have to, after $cataclysm, sure.
[20:19:56] <companion_cube> but no one will willingly do it
[20:20:00] <imode> I'll willingly do it.
[20:20:12] <companion_cube> well you can die first, if it requires a 90% population reduction
[20:20:20] <manicennui> I think we could actually be further with medical research if it were something we focused on as a society and not a commercial pursuit.
[20:20:35] <imode> but how will one monkey thrive over other monkies.
[20:20:36] <manicennui> companion_cube: I'm not advocating killing anyone.
[20:20:40] <manicennui> I know you want to beat that strawman.
[20:20:41] <companion_cube> agreed, but it's not like that'd help, manicennui
[20:20:45] <imode> I am, let's nuke high population centers.
[20:20:51] <imode> then work our way out.
[20:20:59] <companion_cube> thanks for killing me imode
[20:21:05] <imode> np, I'd be killing me too lmao.
[20:21:12] <manicennui> imode: Will you give everyone notice?
[20:21:27] <manicennui> Or at least those of us who sign up for your newsletter?
[20:21:35] <imode> manicennui: I'll file the plans away in a filing cabinet on some far away planet.
[20:21:38] <imode> ;)
[20:21:39] <companion_cube> I think we're stuck in a march forward
[20:21:55] <companion_cube> amd not too optimistic that we can get our shit together enough to not march into a wall
[20:22:05] <imode> "we can get our shit together" who is "w".
[20:22:08] <imode> *"we".
[20:22:11] <manicennui> companion_cube: Until there is a catastrophe.
[20:22:29] <imode> the cause of all of this is large industry and the people who profit from it/built it.
[20:22:38] <companion_cube> and that we all use, alas
[20:22:40] <manicennui> We have already created the conditions for mass human death.
[20:22:43] <imode> who do you go after in drug cases, the dealer or the user.
[20:22:59] <imode> in my view, the dealer. kill the billionaires and trillionaires, dismantle industry.
[20:23:01] <manicennui> Most of the Middle East and other countries in that area are entirely dependent on other countries for food.
[20:23:14] <manicennui> Because their populations far, far exceed the amount of food they can produce, even with modern techniques.
[20:23:32] <manicennui> Then you have climate change.
[20:23:45] <manicennui> The pandemic.
[20:23:51] <companion_cube> sure, kill billionaires and trillionaires
[20:23:58] <manicennui> There are trillionaires?
[20:23:59] <companion_cube> (or reduce them to mere millionaires)
[20:24:09] <companion_cube> but disbanding industry is killing people
[20:24:10] <imode> how about we reduce them to dog food.
[20:24:23] <imode> yeah I don't think fast fashion's absence will kill people.
[20:24:33] <companion_cube> sure
[20:24:43] <companion_cube> but food and medicine are big
[20:24:44] <imode> 90% of industry going away isn't going to kill people.
[20:25:11] <gwozniak> Dismantling industry is not going to save us.  Industry is what people do.  We'll always have it.
[20:25:25] <kl1n3> imode, it would, but only because we're terrible at re-skilling people
[20:25:33] <imode> I don't care about that.
[20:25:41] <imode> accept the population die-off or displacement and move on.
[20:25:49] <imode> we're instructed to do that every damn day when layoffs happen.
[20:25:55] <kl1n3> 90% of industry being closed to new applicants and phased out would be good
[20:26:15] <imode> a slow die-off, eh.
[20:26:21] <imode> that'd last for maybe 50 years.
[20:27:43] <manicennui> imode: What if that is what the billionaires are doing? Making it too expensive for most people to live to reduce the population?
[20:28:30] <imode> building, consolidating and enabling industries that they profit from.
[20:28:51] <manicennui> But if their activities led to a drastic reduction in population, would you support them?
[20:29:17] <imode> not unless it came with a dramatic increase in the quality and quantity of natural biomass on this planet, no.
[20:31:04] <manicennui> So they just need to green up their activities. I'll let them know.
[20:31:35] <companion_cube> political change would help, but a lot of people have been convinced that the rich are actually good
[20:31:49] <manicennui> I think most people just want to be rich.
[20:31:56] <manicennui> With good reason.
[20:32:01] <companion_cube> and they think they can pull it
[20:32:09] <manicennui> Not being rich in the US is kind of lame.
[20:32:11] <companion_cube> even though they're average blue collar in a midwest city
[20:32:16] <companion_cube> like, that's impossible
[20:32:41] <manicennui> What is impossible exactly?
[20:32:50] <companion_cube> to get rich
[20:32:53] <manicennui> Ah.
[20:33:03] <companion_cube> and it's literally impossible that a significant fraction of people get rich
[20:33:18] <companion_cube> so, it's like playing the lottery, hoping to win, and saying " fuck you all" to all other people
[20:33:36] <manicennui> You won't like my response to that...
[20:34:45] <imode> if everyone with a net worth of >$50m, for example, pooled their money together to build a worldwide research institute that could ensure all-the-involved's industries were totally and utterly green, producing little to no waste and not destroying our environment and accelerating climate change, that is a start.
[20:35:00] <manicennui> Let's just say that life is really unfair, and most people are screwed from the start.
[20:35:14] <imode> I don't care that you're rich. I care that you're fucking up the environment that _I_ live in to _stay rich_.
[20:36:38] <imode> being rich means exploitation.
[20:36:44] <bkero> "Fuck you, got mine" is a proud American tradition.
[20:37:06] <companion_cube> anyway, at this point we're probably fucked
[20:37:12] <companion_cube> covid was the proof
[20:37:19] <manicennui> bkero: We learned it from our parents! (the British)
[20:37:38] <manicennui> companion_cube: The pandemic and Trump.
[20:37:40] <imode> yeah but their tradition of "Fuck you, got yours."
[20:37:51] <imode> s/of/was of/
[20:37:54] <manicennui> imode: "Know your place."
[20:38:18] <imode> companion_cube: if only we were fucked, I'd be happy. humans need to fucking die.
[20:38:21] <manicennui> companion_cube: We discovered that half the population is nuts, and that we are unprepared for any kind of crisis.
[20:38:27] <imode> everything else is going to die.
[20:38:30] <imode> and we're going to survive.
[20:38:34] <companion_cube> are we?
[20:38:37] * manicennui thinks kitties will be okay.
[20:38:42] <imode> seven billion people, dude.
[20:38:53] <imode> how are you going to kill. seven billion people. in a single disaster.
[20:39:02] <imode> hitler couldn't even get close to 10 million.
[20:39:07] <manicennui> imode: I have a prediction.
[20:39:09] <companion_cube> you know, a nuclear winter could do a lot
[20:39:13] <Geekingfrog> not 7B
[20:39:16] <imode> we'd still survive.
[20:39:23] <imode> we are a parasite.
[20:39:28] <manicennui> imode: You have a couple billion of those people who live in countries that are wholly dependent on other countries for their survival.
[20:39:47] <imode> manicennui: we'd still survive.
[20:39:50] <manicennui> A climate disaster in some of the Earth's prime food production areas could interrupt things long enough to cause mass starvation.
[20:40:05] <companion_cube> so, like, a nuclear winter? 🤔
[20:40:06] <manicennui> It wouldn't wipe out all of humanity.
[20:40:10] <imode> our species has survived ice ages. massive volcanic eruptions. plates shifting beneath our feet.
[20:40:11] <manicennui> But it would be horrific.
[20:40:20] <imode> we'll survive.
[20:40:31] <companion_cube> well it was also people adapted to their environment
[20:40:55] <imode> that's my point. we're on a track where the only thing that would kill us is total destruction of the planet. and I mean total.
[20:41:05] <companion_cube> a person living in the US currently would be totally fucked in a situation where our ancestors 15k years ago did ok
[20:41:17] <manicennui> imode: Won't you settle for a large reduction?
[20:41:18] <companion_cube> so for me that's the opposite
[20:41:21] <companion_cube> we're fragile
[20:41:31] <imode> in the short term we're fragile.
[20:41:40] <imode> in the long term, we're incredibly strong.
[20:41:53] <imode> as is any organism with the ability to adapt to its environment.
[20:42:02] <imode> we have the ability to learn, think, reason.
[20:42:33] <manicennui> Crypto will save us!
[20:42:36] <imode> manicennui: it'd have to play out such that we have a total reset.
[20:42:40] <imode> like, total reset.
[20:42:47] <manicennui> That isn't happening.
[20:42:48] <imode> no billionaires, no people hiding out with modern tech.
[20:42:56] <imode> total societal collapse.
[20:42:57] <manicennui> Why can't you settle for a couple billion dead?
[20:43:12] <imode> I can, it just needs to accompany a vast reduction in available technology as well.
[20:43:24] <imode> also that just taken out of context is hilarious.
[20:43:41] <imode> I feel like we're in a board meeting for the third reich.
[20:44:07] <imode> if you really wanna feel sick to your stomach, this was probably a serious conversation at some table for industry owners.
[20:44:29] <imode> who actually do control the future of this planet.
[20:45:17] <manicennui> Can't really have endless growth without population growth.
[20:45:50] <imode> your future, my future, your kids' future, every future for every plant, animal, bug on this planet, is in the hands of just a few people.
[20:46:00] <manicennui> Fortunately I don't have kids.

[20:55:38] <riv> recently learned that covid tests are made in china
[20:55:51] <manicennui> Isn't everything?
[20:55:55] <riv> yeah
[20:56:03] <riv> lots of single use plastic stuff comes from there
[20:56:59] <manicennui> Most Apple stuff I buy seems to be shipped directly from China.
[21:02:50] <epilys> lol, the health minister here in greece said "cyprus pcr tests are cheaper than in greece because they are made in china" but greece has the same pcr tests and the same company supplier
[21:03:00] <epilys> and now he denies ever saying it
[21:03:01] <manicennui> A couple of our teams have a good racket going. They do such a bad job that their shit is always broken, so they are always overworked, so we end up having to pick up the slack and work on their shit.
[21:03:14] <manicennui> But everyone has the impression that they do a lot.
[21:04:09] <manicennui> So basically we are punished for having a well-running team with code that isn't a complete disaster.

[21:09:36] <manicennui> I wouldn't even care if we were paid drastically more than those clowns.
[21:10:25] <manicennui> I need to become rich so imode hates me (more).
[21:30:32] <manicennui> imode: Good news: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/18/chemical-pollution-has-passed-safe-limit-for-humanity-say-scientists
[21:30:33] <buttsbot> Chemical pollution has passed safe limit for humanity, say scientists | Pollution | The Guardian
[21:30:46] <manicennui> The cocktail of chemical pollution that pervades the planet now threatens the stability of global ecosystems upon which humanity depends, scientists have said.
[21:36:38] <imode> manicennui: so when are we going to kill rich people.
[21:36:54] <manicennui> We aren't.
[21:37:11] <manicennui> We are going to watch another show on Netflix and smoke some pot, then play video games.
[21:37:53] <manicennui> Just wait until we get everyone hooked into the metaverse!
[21:37:57] <imode> just market something called Rich Killer 2022 or something.
[21:38:31] <imode> then slowly distort people's ability to tell reality from fiction.
[21:40:42] <manicennui> I'll watch from my land with my chickens.
[21:42:19] <manicennui> I don't understand these headlines: "Microsoft to gobble up Activision in $69 billion metaverse bet"
[21:42:38] <manicennui> A bunch of sources are trying to tie this to "metaverse".
[21:42:46] <manicennui> I didn't even realize that "metaverse" was a more generic thing.
[21:43:12] <manicennui> And I don't know what buying a company that is not really into VR has to do with it.
[21:43:38] <manicennui> Are they trying to rebrand gaming as "metaverse"?
[21:44:10] <ngoldbaum> if fortnite is a metaverse, yes
[21:44:56] <manicennui> https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-buy-activision-blizzard-deal-687-billion-2022-01-18/
[21:44:57] <buttsbot> Microsoft to gobble up Activision in $69 billion metaverse bet | Reuters
[21:45:14] <manicennui> The part starting with 'METAVERSE ARMS RACE' is about nothing but gaming.
[21:45:20] <riv> Rich Killer 2022 LOL
[21:45:25] <manicennui> Really does seem like they are just trying to rebrand gaming now.
[21:45:34] <manicennui> And I don't even know who "they" is.
[21:45:54] <manicennui> I assume the reporters at all of these places are being fed by someone.
[21:46:44] <manicennui> "This is a significant deal for the consumer side of the business and more importantly, Microsoft acquiring Activision really starts the metaverse arms race," David Wagner, Equity Analyst and Portfolio Manager at Aptus Capital Advisors said.
[21:46:46] <manicennui> ?!
[21:46:50] <Geekingfrog> What's this metaverse creeping up everywhere. Was it something from before the facebook rebrand? It seems it's springing out of nowhere
[21:47:00] <manicennui> Geekingfrog: I don't know.
[21:47:04] <riv> facebooks metaverse is basically just some bitcoin VR thing
[21:47:09] <manicennui> I thought it was just a dumb idea from the Zuck.
[21:47:10] <riv> with loads of marketing in it
[21:47:15] <riv> nothing important
[21:47:31] <Geekingfrog> every single thing I've seen for the metaverse was very very shitty or completely uninspiring, when not downright distopian
[21:47:32] <manicennui> But there are like a dozen articles today about the acquisition that mention metaverse multiple times.
[21:47:36] <manicennui> And none explain why.
[21:48:09] <manicennui> You're no longer gaming. You're in the METAVERSE!
[21:48:57] <manicennui> "Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick: Metaverse race helped prompt Microsoft deal"
[21:49:18] <riv> "what if we made VR shit and boring"
[21:49:44] <manicennui> They don't even talk about VR at all.
[21:49:55] <manicennui> Does Activision/Blizz make any VR games?
[21:50:09] <manicennui> Certainly nothing that is a significant chunk of their revenue.
[21:50:12] <riv> I assume every big company will be thinking about VR moves
[21:51:24] <ngoldbaum> riv: no need, VR is already shit and boring, on the whole

[21:54:15] <manicennui> The most expensive spots are near where lots of users congregate — for instance, someone recently paid $450,000 to be Snoop Dogg’s neighbor in a virtual world called the Sandbox.
[21:54:23] <drakonis> welp there's someone ban evading with matrix lol
[21:54:38] <drakonis> fuckin matrix, man.
[21:55:32] <manicennui> Is our entire economy going to become based on large scale scams?
[21:58:39] <manicennui> https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/16/22887011/walmart-metaverse-nft-cryptocurrency
[21:58:40] <buttsbot> Walmart is getting serious about the metaverse - The Verge
[21:58:50] <manicennui> Recent trademark applications indicate the company is looking to establish its own NFTs and cryptocurrency, according to a report from CNBC.
[21:58:51] <manicennui> Yay!
[21:59:15] <manicennui> Hopefully they force their employees to be paid in their currency, which is only good at Walmart.
[22:00:24] <manicennui> Fortunately we already know that Costco wins the corporate wars.
[22:00:40] <skyl4rk> "no you didn't buy this food, you bought this receipt that says you bought this food,. the food isn't actually yours. off to jail with you!"
[22:00:50] <ngoldbaum> welcome to costco VR, i love you
[22:01:24] <manicennui> All of this stuff makes this profession feel like an even bigger joke than it is.
[22:06:53] <gwozniak> It is seriously stupid
[22:07:01] <gwozniak> I have said this at work, too
[22:17:57] <Brekkjern> I thought company scrip was illegal in the US or something?
[22:26:58] <gwozniak> It will be some sort of rewards program, I'm sure
[22:27:36] <manicennui> Walmart already pays most of their employees on Chime.
[22:27:58] <manicennui> While Chime isn't a currency, it is super bad for its users.
[22:35:00] <gwozniak> Wow. Not liking Bamboo at the moment
[22:35:36] <gwozniak> It grabbed an old version of an artifact and that is not what I wanted it to do at all
[22:39:23] <ngoldbaum> quality australian code
[22:40:09] <gwozniak> Plan B depends on Plan A.  'A' failed, so 'B' grabbed the artifact of a previous build instead.
[22:47:20] <indigo> Ah, good ol' software
[22:47:30] <indigo> Are you guys finally migrating off of kube for builds?
[22:48:20] <gwozniak> I'm pushing to move to use the Jenkins infra we have instead of Bamboo, which we continue to pay licensing fees for
[22:49:02] <Brekkjern> Bamboo is such shit
[22:49:07] <gwozniak> Jenkins will be some combo of kube and our own machines, I expect. It has not been worked out
[22:49:42] <ngoldbaum> jenkins is also shit tho
[22:49:44] <gwozniak> We have a complicated build, mainly for performance reasons
[22:49:57] <gwozniak> I don't really have any other options
[22:52:45] <gwozniak> On our current infra (using Bamboo), our toolchain builds sometimes take nearly 4 hours to build, when it should be done in about an hour
[22:53:02] <gwozniak> This is because we get allocated very little CPU, so it just crawls
[22:54:52] <manicennui> One of my coworkers is really pushing his slacking to the max. He is on a call, has video off, but at one point we clearly heard a waitress ask if someone was ready for another beer.
[22:56:05] <imode> why is that slacking off.
[22:56:31] <companion_cube> he doesn't have the sound off? heh
[22:56:33] <imode> sitting in a bar and working should be no different than sitting at home and working.
[22:56:58] <manicennui> imode: Technically we aren't supposed to work after drinking.
[22:57:10] <imode> legally?
[22:57:12] <manicennui> And this isn't really the first sign.
[22:57:24] <imode> if legally then that's a different matter, yeah.
[22:57:34] <imode> otherwise it's corporate policy.
[22:57:39] <imode> and fuck corporate policy.
[22:57:41] <manicennui> imode: If you have been drinking and something happens at work, it can have repercussions for things like insurance.
[22:57:57] <manicennui> Don't know how that works when no one is working from the office.
[22:58:30] <manicennui> I imagine if he introduced a major bug that fucked everyone over, and people found out that he had been drinking when he introduced it, it would be a problem.
[22:58:42] <manicennui> But it's more about the fact that he frequently makes it obvious that he isn't doing much work.
[22:59:01] <manicennui> Fortunately for him, I couldn't care less about corporations anymore.
[22:59:02] <imode> if he introduces a bug and there was evidence that he was intoxicated, the bug should take priority over someone's intoxication.
[22:59:17] <manicennui> imode: Of course.
[22:59:39] <imode> that someone was intoxicated is nobody's business. their work output is what should be judged.
[22:59:48] <manicennui> Basically, he is just not being smart about his slacking.
[23:00:24] <imode> I've been drunk while programming. that's of nobody's business unless it results in damages.
[23:00:38] <gwozniak> It would push my trust level of that person down a lot
[23:01:30] <imode> I have to take several grams of CBD every month in order to feel normal, with varying amounts week over week. I still produce quality code, documentation and guidance.
[23:01:35] <imode> that would knock most of you out.
[23:01:48] <imode> don't judge someone unless their work is unsatisfactory.
[23:02:02] <imode> lest you be judged by the same standards arbitrarily.
[23:02:30] <manicennui> imode: Again, my concern is not that he might be out at a restaurant having a beer. My concern is that he isn't being smart about his slacking, and he is making it more and more obvious over time.
[23:03:07] <manicennui> We have it good, and there is no need for him to give people a reason to crack down.
[23:03:10] <imode> what is "slacking" in this context. is he not showing up to meetings, not doing any work?
[23:03:28] <manicennui> He often misses meetings or shows up late, and his output is pretty low.
[23:03:36] <imode> then that should be the judgement.
[23:03:46] <ngoldbaum> cbd isn’t intoxicating
[23:03:49] <manicennui> He admits to the team all the time that he doesn't actually start until noon, stops working at 2, etc.
[23:03:56] <manicennui> Which again, I don't care about.
[23:03:59] <imode> ngoldbaum: it can impair at high doses.
[23:04:08] <imode> much like alcohol can.
[23:04:08] <manicennui> But he did this in a meeting with people from another department, including a manager.
[23:04:10] <ngoldbaum> if someone is drinking while they’re at work my prior that they have a drinking problem goes way up
[23:04:27] <ngoldbaum> secretly drinking at work anyway
[23:04:33] <companion_cube> ahah damn, admitting working 2h a day
[23:04:35] <companion_cube> that's the issue :D
[23:04:44] <manicennui> We used to have a beer at lunch on Fridays sometimes at the last place I worked. I think that was fine.
[23:04:47] <imode> I mean.
[23:04:57] <manicennui> companion_cube: It's a series of things like that.
[23:05:05] <imode> if his output is low, that's the issue here.
[23:05:15] <imode> we have no right to invade someone's personal life. shape up or ship off.
[23:05:33] <manicennui> imode: I don't care that he drinks and gets high.
[23:05:53] <manicennui> Again, he just isn't being smart.
[23:06:05] <imode> certainly not, he sounds like an idiot. self-destructive at that.
[23:06:31] <manicennui> I do think he is a bit of an annoying pothead type at times, and I can't stand being around him when he has had a lot to drink.
[23:06:56] <manicennui> I've only been around him when he has had a lot to drink after hours to be clear.
[23:07:27] <manicennui> He becomes very loud and obnoxious, and other coworkers have commented on it too and avoid him after hours.
[23:08:16] <manicennui> He and a couple other people also do really baffling shit for free food.
[23:08:24] <imode> unless in the presence of consenting parties, work's basis should be that you sit behind a wall and perform whatever your duties are, and submit the results through a slit or a gate in that wall.
[23:08:38] <imode> and when you're done, you leave.
[23:08:41] <gwozniak> Eh, sort of
[23:08:42] <manicennui> Like he was adamant that he wanted to be permanently remote, but he sometimes goes into the office on the day that we have catered breakfast.
[23:08:54] <imode> why not have breakfast at home lmao.
[23:08:57] <manicennui> I don't understand software engineers in the US becoming excited by $5 of free food.
[23:09:04] <companion_cube> :DDD
[23:09:06] <indigo> I like cooking at home, heh
[23:09:11] <companion_cube> you don't have to cook, I guess
[23:09:14] <manicennui> imode: In my experience, a lot of young software engineers are obsessed with free food.
[23:09:22] <imode> manicennui: were they starved as kids or something.
[23:09:22] <manicennui> Even if it is not good.
[23:09:30] <manicennui> And it's not as though we don't pay enough.
[23:09:35] <gwozniak> If you can't get along with your teammates and are a problem even though you can produce "good output", I'd probably still want you gone
[23:10:00] <imode> gwozniak: "can't get along with" implies that there are situations where social standing or judgement impacts work output.
[23:10:00] <Geekingfrog> something free is really powerful. It's a well studied phenomenon. Even if you get crap for free, it's still very appealing
[23:10:05] <manicennui> gwozniak: He is mostly fine during work hours as far as getting along with people.
[23:10:10] <indigo> gwozniak: What about someone that is producing not so great output, but improving, and is decent to work with
[23:10:13] <manicennui> gwozniak: He is just kind of an annoying young guy.
[23:10:22] <gwozniak> indigo: I'm fine with that
[23:10:36] <manicennui> Geekingfrog: I don't find it compelling.
[23:10:41] <imode> gwozniak: so if you have someone that's routinely making trouble for others, or getting into fights, that's going to affect work output.
[23:10:47] <indigo> gwozniak: But sometimes they talk about cryptocurrency, and think that federated platforms are the future
[23:10:53] <indigo> FIRED.
[23:10:56] <gwozniak> lol
[23:11:12] <imode> financial independence, retire early & dumb?
[23:11:14] <companion_cube> "go make an NFT of your work contract"
[23:11:29] <manicennui> Another long-time engineer gave an internal talk about chia coin, which was fucking annoying.
[23:11:40] <Geekingfrog> :D
[23:11:41] <imode> are you for real.
[23:11:53] <gwozniak> I'd happily give a talk to say how silly it was
[23:12:00] <imode> "look at this dumb shit"
[23:12:05] <Geekingfrog> here I had coworkers sharing stuff about nft and cryptoshit, but that was satire and mocking that crowd
[23:12:06] <manicennui> The really funny part is that it has gone down in value.
[23:12:14] <companion_cube> oh ffs chia
[23:12:16] <manicennui> Sharing is one thing.
[23:12:27] <companion_cube> "hey why not just throw away perfectly good new hardware"
[23:12:36] <manicennui> We have a weekly time period for internal tech talks, and he decided to use it to sell us on chia.
[23:12:38] <imode> we need SOMETHING to boost storage sales.
[23:12:42] <imode> actually wait.
[23:12:51] <imode> what is Chia's mining value based off of.
[23:12:55] <imode> like how do you mine chia.
[23:12:59] <manicennui> Hard drive space.
[23:13:02] <imode> ...
[23:13:07] <imode> has anybody thought of a RAM disk.
[23:13:22] <imode> that can fake storage space.
[23:13:27] <manicennui> Why? SSDs are far cheaper.
[23:13:30] <imode> no no.
[23:13:36] <companion_cube> imode: you need to generate garbage
[23:13:39] <companion_cube> and then keep it
[23:13:50] <companion_cube> and some day, a piece of garbage will sprout into a 1$ bill
[23:14:04] <companion_cube> think of the gigantic garbage dumps we can cultivate to get money!
[23:14:07] <imode> is that actually how that works.
[23:14:10] <companion_cube> yes
[23:14:16] <companion_cube> you mine garbage on SSDs
[23:14:24] <companion_cube> then copy it to hard drives for long term storage iirc
[23:14:29] <companion_cube> the SSDs die pretty quickly
[23:14:42] <imode> why not just dump it into a RAM disk and then regenerate it on the fly.
[23:14:46] <imode> fake it.
[23:14:54] <imode> fake that you have fifty billion terabytes.
[23:15:07] <imode> counterfeit flash drives seem to have that down.
[23:15:09] <companion_cube> I think you need the more or less random access that storage gives you
[23:15:14] <companion_cube> it's just totally braindead
[23:15:26] <manicennui> Imagine if the value of chia were higher than the cost of s3.
[23:15:34] <Geekingfrog> :D
[23:15:42] <manicennui> Suddenly half the world's electricity is being used to power s3.
[23:16:19] <imode> that would horrify me.
[23:18:09] <manicennui> Even if chia were just somewhat valuable, it could cause a run on SSDs, making another component of computers hard to find.
[23:18:43] <imode> spinning disks pls.
[23:18:43] <manicennui> I think there are other dumb coins based on hard drive space.
[23:19:20] <imode> the real money is in mercury delay lines.
[23:19:57] * manicennui creates a coin based on CPU utilization. 
[23:20:08] <imode> isn't that just bitcoin with a CPU miner.
[23:20:11] <manicennui> Number of GHz consumed.
[23:20:30] <manicennui> I'm just trying to figure out how to fuck us all faster.
[23:20:46] <manicennui> We have memory, CPU, and power to use up.
[23:20:47] <Geekingfrog> or a chain powered by captach solving
[23:21:06] <Geekingfrog> so you get money from the coins AND from leasing the solver to scammers and spammers
[23:21:07] <manicennui> Proof of Wattage
[23:21:14] <gwozniak> Maybe it's time for a cult along the lines of Heaven's Gate where the reward is more crypto coins
[23:21:28] <imode> CarbonCoin. the amount of trash burned, recognized by computer vision, gets you crypto.
[23:21:32] <manicennui> gwozniak: Those are called DAOs.
[23:21:37] <imode> go burn tires to collect money.
[23:21:46] <imode> the larger the flame, the better.
[23:22:01] <gwozniak> manicennui: I was more getting at the need to wait for something like a comet that will result in mass suicide
[23:22:10] <imode> seriously if you gave a general economic impetus to literally burn everything down it'd be gone in a year.
[23:22:15] <companion_cube> manicennui: a proof-of-plastic-in-ocean blockchain
[23:22:22] <imode> and by it, I mean the world.
[23:22:35] <gwozniak> proof of nukes!
[23:22:39] <Geekingfrog> :D
[23:22:41] <manicennui> Can one of you do something cool with computers for a change?
[23:22:51] <gwozniak> I'll make mine draw a bunny
[23:22:52] <companion_cube> I can put mine in the freezer
[23:22:54] <manicennui> So this all doesn't seem like a joke.
[23:23:07] <imode> no, we can't do anything with computers for a change.
[23:23:17] <imode> from the holocaust to now, there's been nothing good that's come out of computers.
[23:23:20] <companion_cube> oh oh I know a good blockchain
[23:23:24] <companion_cube> proof-of-downvote
[23:23:31] <Geekingfrog> why make something cool when one can make money ?
[23:23:32] <companion_cube> that's an eternal windmill
[23:23:38] <manicennui> I learned about Jorts from computers.
[23:23:51] <manicennui> https://www.cnet.com/how-to/jorts-the-cat-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-internets-new-favourite-cat/
[23:23:51] <buttsbot> Jorts the cat: Everything you need to know about the internet's new favourite cat - CNET
[23:24:02] <imode> you wanna know something that could be a genuinely depressing technological achievement.
[23:24:12] <imode> a crypto coin that's backed by how much CSAM you store.
[23:24:31] <imode> if you just wanna sit down and cry about how that could be real right now.
[23:24:38] <manicennui> I was going to say, "What we are using them for now?", but you went there...
[23:24:54] <manicennui> Computers definitely make CSAM easier to distribute.
[23:24:55] <imode> the world is sick. burn it down.
[23:24:57] <manicennui> So there is that.
[23:25:50] <ngoldbaum> ruh roh surprise new laptop firmware before a meeting
[23:26:08] <imode> "can't come, boss. firmware update."
[23:26:27] <ngoldbaum> i bet that happens a lot with mac os updates
[23:26:32] <ngoldbaum> they take foreeeeveeerr
[23:26:52] <gwozniak> yeah, they are pretty slow
[23:27:44] <manicennui> I know to never start a Mac update during work hours.
[23:27:50] <manicennui> Unless I actually want to be unable to work.
[23:28:25] <manicennui> Unfortunately I rarely remember to do them after work.
[23:37:12] <gwozniak> omfg docker
[23:38:36] <gwozniak> Build with docker on Bamboo failed because something with Docker shit the bed, but all the files were created by root so Bamboo couldn't clean up its workspace
[23:38:39] <gwozniak> jfc
[23:47:09] <indigo> gwozniak: https://www.redbubble.com/i/t-shirt/Dead-Docker-by-jogz/25858844.I57B7 this is the shirt for you

[23:47:22] *** Joins: buttsbot (~buttsbot@31.187.71.242)
[23:47:49] <gwozniak> I feel that
[23:50:49] <Geekingfrog> companion_cube would appreciate that as well
[23:52:31] <manicennui> I get what containers are supposed to accomplish in theory, but every time someone tries to use them for something at work, they seem to introduce just as many problems.
[23:52:58] <gwozniak> I'm not convinced they have simplified things here
[23:53:05] <manicennui> And then the same people who thought they were avoiding learning sys/network admin by using containers has no idea what to do.
[23:53:17] <gwozniak> That's the key thing
[23:56:13] <gwozniak> Suddenly, everyone has to be knowledgable about sysadmining stuff to have any hope of debugging it
[23:56:27] <gwozniak> Because it always fails or does something you weren't expecting at some point
[23:56:45] <gwozniak> And the fucking DNS shit...
