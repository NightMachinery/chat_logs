[06:33:56] <purpux> Hey everyone... I don't know if this is the right channel to ask this on, but where can I find a Linux compatible GPU in Bangalore ?
[06:34:03] <purpux> All cards here are nVidia
[06:34:32] <purpux> Which I don't mind buying, but I don't know the state of the drivers for some of the cards, and would prefer AMD..
[06:34:53] <AryaBackup[m]> ig you can see online
[06:35:12] <AryaBackup[m]> ia m not sure abt bangalore but here in chennai i have heard ritchie street is a nice place
[06:35:15] <purpux> everything is being scalped online
[06:35:27] <purpux> AryaBackup[m]: We have SP road here, but no one has AMD stock
[06:35:32] <AryaBackup[m]> igpu?
[06:35:39] <AryaBackup[m]> rip
[06:36:31] <purpux> I have an iGPU, but I cannot really game on it can I ? Also I want to do a PCI passthrough for gaming, but I cannot do that with only my shitty iGPU
[06:37:31] <AryaBackup[m]> due to my igpu i quit gaming lol
[06:37:37] <purpux> AryaBackup[m]: lmao
[06:37:38] <AryaBackup[m]> i mean never got into gaming
[06:37:59] <AryaBackup[m]> i have only really had 2 pcs and used 3 
[06:38:12] <purpux> Well, I guess I just have to wait till prices drop.... *sigh*
[06:38:29] <AryaBackup[m]> other than my current one which i have been using since dec both my old ones were igpu
[06:38:35] <AryaBackup[m]> purpux: sad
[06:38:36] <AryaBackup[m]> probably nvidia amd will fix the prices higher
[06:38:57] <purpux> the problem with nvidia is that the drivers are suck a pain in the ass
[06:39:11] <AryaBackup[m]> yeah
[06:39:14] <AryaBackup[m]> i use nouveau
[06:39:16] <AryaBackup[m]> no problem
[06:39:20] <purpux> sure ?
[06:39:25] <AryaBackup[m]> yes
[06:39:27] <purpux> I have heard nouveau is very bad ?
[06:39:33] <AryaBackup[m]> it works for me
[06:39:40] <purpux> Which card do you have ?
[06:39:42] <AryaBackup[m]> i can play xonotic pretty well in default settings

[13:16:04] <SaharshBhansali[> AryaBackup[m]: Uh huh, I did read a lot about this in textbooks, but they never really explained much...

[13:17:45] <AryaBackup[m]> SaharshBhansali[: matrix is a more modern protocol
[13:17:48] <AryaBackup[m]> more of a discord alternative
[13:17:51] <AryaBackup[m]> has encryption and stuff
[13:17:54] <AryaBackup[m]> way better than tg
[13:17:58] <AryaBackup[m]> its federated
[13:19:20] <SaharshBhansali[> Is that what "Arya (Migrated back to matrix.org)" (in your username part) indicates?
[13:19:42] <AryaBackup[m]> i used to host my own homeserver for matrix
[13:20:10] <AryaBackup[m]> now i switched back to the official homeserver as it took up too much network bandwith and made my 200mbps connection 2mbps
[13:20:59] <SaharshBhansali[> This sounds like something that won't work well out of the box though?
[13:20:59] <SaharshBhansali[> Welp, I do have an exam tomorrow, but after this I've got just the right amount of days off to do all the set up and installation :)

[15:57:08] <AryaBackup[m]> i will look into it
