[01:58:32] <nickoe_> Hello
[01:59:03] *** Quits: flower_ (~debian@217-123-218-6.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[02:00:11] <nickoe_> I am tying to get some data from yahoo finance via getSymbols from quantmod, but for some tickers I don't get much data at all, only one line. For example: getSymbols('SPIEMIKL.CO', src = "yahoo", auto.assign = FALSE)
[02:00:47] <nickoe_> Is this quantmod or yahoo that is buggy?
[02:02:44] *** Joins: flower_ (~debian@217-123-218-6.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl)
[02:04:02] <nickoe_> Hmm, It looks like it is just this page that is retuerned... and this is also pretty empty? https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPIEMIKL.CO/history?p=SPIEMIKL.CO
[02:05:42] <confuzius> what is "not much data"? is that not all the data available on that?
[02:07:10] <confuzius> also, you could trouble shoot the issue by downloading a page that you know has a lot of data and see if it does not download all the data
[02:11:26] <nickoe_> confuzius it only shows the current day and no historical data
[02:12:20] <confuzius> because there is no historical data on yahoo?
[02:12:26] <nickoe_> See above URL vs https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history?p=AAPL
[02:12:31] <nickoe_> yes, it appears so
[02:12:39] *** Quits: palasso (~palasso@user/palasso) (Quit: I am not a quitter!)
[02:13:58] <confuzius> that explains why quantmod cannot find the data. it only downloads data when it is available.
[02:15:55] <nickoe_> yes, indeed.
[02:16:08] <confuzius> to be sure that quantmod is working, you can manually download the csv for a specific period, say for apple, and also download it via quantmod and compare
[02:24:11] <nickoe_> It spits out a warning with the url to the csv it gets and that also just contains one row of data.
[02:28:22] <confuzius> ?
[02:29:11] <confuzius> oh, you mean the index? or AAPL?
[02:34:53] <nickoe_> The index only contains one row on the yahoo website, and subsequently also in the data I try to pull :(ø
[02:38:28] <confuzius> then quantmod is working perfectly fine. used it once for homework data eons ago

[12:19:16] <nickoe_> I am trying to understand how load data correctly into the xts object. I have tried to use zoo and as.xts but it the matrix is not arranged as I wanted it to be. How can I control what fields are the data and which are the columns?  Code snippet https://ideone.com/BBievu
[12:21:29] *** Quits: Vojtaeus (~vojta@user/vojtaeus) (Quit: Odcházím...)
[12:29:04] <confuzius> any chance you got to RTFM for the package? i am not sure i get the issue? you want to sort the data?
[12:40:32] <nickoe_> well, the package is new to me and yes I have read the docs, but
[12:41:54] <nickoe_> I think I found that argument split which appaers to work, when I select the appropiate colums from the source data.
[12:42:34] <nickoe_> So this appears to work, read.zoo(mydata[,c(1,2,4)], split="ticker")
[12:45:46] <confuzius> wonderful. the manual is usually the answer to esoteric packages
