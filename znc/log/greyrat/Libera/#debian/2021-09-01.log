[00:22:18] <TheSHAD0W> Howdy.  I have a problem with a rack system.  It has a hardware KVM installed, but unless the KVM has that system selected on boot (it basically has no monitor or input devices attached), it basically boots console-less and can't be logged into that way.  Is there a way to enable that anyway?

[00:59:04] <TheSHAD0W> No, display turns itself off.
[00:59:58] <TheSHAD0W> I just checked to see if it was opening a display on the VGA output instead, but it wasn't doing that...
[01:00:07] <TheSHAD0W> Still haven't checked the DVI...
[01:00:19] <PMT> How are you connecting a display to it, out of curiosity?
[01:00:27] <TheSHAD0W> HDMI port.
[01:00:38] <PMT> And what hardware is this, if I can ask? I'm sure it's probably buried in the log somewhere.
[01:00:44] <TheSHAD0W> This is a B550 motherboard with an AMD CPU.
[01:00:47] <at0m> tried switching to other TTY's? Ctrl-Alt-F2/3/4.. sometimes i get nothing on TTY1
[01:00:57] <TheSHAD0W> Let me triple check.
[01:01:46] <PMT> I'd still expect you to get sufficent signal for the monitor to not go "peace, nothing here, i'm out" even if nothing was displayed, I think.
[01:01:46] <at0m> or, like, press "Enter to activate" or whatever that may do
[01:02:21] <PMT> (not saying not to try it, just that i'll be surprised if it works)
[01:02:40] <at0m> and maybe, if it's got different video outputs on the motherboard, it defaults to VGA instead of DVI or so when it finds nothing connected on boot
[01:02:52] <TheSHAD0W> Those are the mobo outputs.
[01:03:12] <TheSHAD0W> It's an APU chip with the video on the chip.  R7-4750G.
[01:03:47] <PMT> oh i see
[01:03:53] <TheSHAD0W> Yeah, the mobo goes to sleep; I switched the KVM to another system and it works, switching it back makes the monitor go to sleep.
[01:04:11] <PMT> it's logging that it wants nonfree firmware to init the GPU with no head attached on boot, but with head attached you keep using the EFI video hooks
[01:04:23] <TheSHAD0W> Hmm.

[13:13:19] <dob1> or f1
[13:13:38] <dob1> whatever the name it is, it looks for the extension

[13:15:11] <dob1> I was aware of this but this will require a new file to be created
[13:16:07] <PerfDave> That happens in the background anyway
[13:16:15] <PerfDave> Why not just rename it to have a .gz extension?
[13:17:14] <dob1> there is a backup software called burp, it backup data in that way. So I have a directory fulls of file that are compressed but without the .gz extension
[13:17:29] <dob1> I was trying to restore them manually

[13:18:50] <PerfDave> I would recommend not trying to manually prod the internals of a backup system
[13:18:57] <dob1> PerfDave, it's a client/server backup and I am not able, I have a version mismatch between client and server. 
[13:19:44] <dob1> probably it will be resolved once I upgrade to bullseye
[13:19:57] <PerfDave> Server version is too new for the client? I hate backup systems which aren't backwards-compatible; I hit this with rdiff-backup when I upgraded my server to Debian 11, but borg seems fine.

[13:23:34] <dob1> PerfDave, it's a very old backup, I was trying to restore it and move it to a new partition. It't not so urgent. I hope to resolve once burp will be upgraded on buster -> bullseye upgrade
[13:23:52] <PerfDave> (assuming it is a version mismatch; might be worth talking to the burp people to see if they can shine a light on it)

[13:32:50] <PMT> sure, but keeping a .gz filename doesn't make sense if you removed the gz, or bz2, or ..., so it's written to a new file. your argument makes sense if they didn't use file extensions, but they do.

[17:19:51] <zerowalker_w> PerfDave, that works, i meant if it's kept mounted, and it's changed in parallel to this, will the mounted place detect those changes or will you have to remount it. It seems to require a remount but i want to make sure i am not just doing it wrong. Though i understand this is probably a rare case that you don't really want to do, it's mostly out of interest on how it works.

[17:24:54] <PerfDave> zerowalker_w: If it's being mounted by the same kernel in a different place it *might* work but I wouldn't trust it; if the image is being manipulated in a different way it almost certainly won't.

[17:32:13] <jelly> and probably safer to sync afterwards if you're writing to device directly
[17:33:06] <PerfDave> Yeah, I tend to use the "unmount" UI functionality that KDE gives me, which presumably does a sync && umount under the hood

[22:33:56] <trysten> how do I use sources.list? asking as a 10-year debian user
[22:34:31] <trysten> I'm extremely frustrated. I literally just want to add the security repository to my sources.list on debian stable
[22:35:32] <PMT> !bullseye sources.list
[22:35:32] <dpkg> A suitable /etc/apt/sources.list for "Bullseye" has three lines: "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye main" "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main" "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-updates main". See <deb-src> <contrib> <non-free> <bullseye-updates> and `man sources.list`.
[22:36:02] <PMT> is that sufficient, or did you have a question that doesn't answer?
[22:36:09] <trysten> I've read several web pages. I read the man pages. Is it just the case that the security repo doesn't support the "stable" label? if so, where is that documented?
[22:36:15] <trysten> yes that's sufficient. But i'm still frustrated :(
[22:36:32] <sney> !stable sources.list 
[22:36:32] <dpkg> Despite the fact previous installers, countless websites and /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list (prior to apt 0.9.6) will tell you to do this, do *not* use "stable" in your sources.list; use the release code name instead (e.g. "bullseye").  Upgrading between releases has not been trivial for a decade; make sure you read the <release notes> and ask me about <buster->bullseye>, <jessie sources.list>.
[22:37:02] <trysten> Thank you. That converts my frustration to anger which I can _handle_. Thanks.
[22:37:08] <trysten> *jeesh*
[22:38:00] <trysten> :cookie:
[22:38:23] <sney> apparently linode deployed (some) buster VM images with "stable" in sources.list, which left several people with a nasty surprise ~3 weeks ago when their instances were suddenly tracking bullseye 
[22:38:37] <sney> use the codenames. it's a best practice and it's what all the other experienced users do. 
[22:38:44] <somiaj> trysten: one shouldn't be using 'stable', instaed use 'bullseye'
[22:39:12] <somiaj> I wasn't aware that the secuirty repos are enforcing this, but I haven't tried with just stable
[22:39:43] <trysten> somiaj: I'm a bit embarassed that I didn't detect that. Obviously specificity is preferred, but I was just stuck on "stable". I saw it too many times, I guess.
[22:39:58] <somiaj> seems like 'stable-security' works, note the security repo has always had a different name
