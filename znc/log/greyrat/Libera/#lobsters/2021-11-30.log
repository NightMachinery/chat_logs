[00:00:15] <sam_> If you don't want to use Firefox, I would simply not use it. Not pin it ot a known vulnerable version..

[00:00:54] <Teckla> pe: What kind of Firefox update problems have you encountered?
[00:01:10] <jle> unless you have lots of add-ons, what problems do you face? (outside of stupid UI updates)
[00:01:29] <pe> Teckla: most of the time they fuck up the UI.
[00:01:47] <pe> When you think they can't possibly make any worse. They manage.
[00:01:53] <pe> *make it
[00:02:26] <pe> And then you have to spend several hours making it so that you don't want to throw your computer out the window.
[00:02:41] <Teckla> Oh, I have liked some of the UI changes, and disliked some of them, but overall, it seems fine to me.
[00:03:17] <jle> :O
[00:05:01] <jle> I find it annyoing that options (that can't be much of work to keep) gets removed.. I don't need a "close" button on every single tab!

[00:09:44] <pe> You. Are. Wrong.     Physically. As a human.
[00:09:54] <Teckla> I don't really care either way, though
[00:09:59] <Teckla> pe: heheh!
[00:11:49] <pe> In some other version, it started animating even when you disabled animations.
[00:12:11] <pe> Though I guess they only make things twice as bad only about once a year.
[00:12:28] <drobilla> The "tabs" (to use the term loosely)
[00:12:39] <drobilla> are objectively bad, but the rest I don't really care much about
[00:12:57] <pe> And to be fair to Chromium, it does actually do one thing better.
[00:13:02] <pe> It supports v4 ICC profiles.
[00:14:16] <pe> And neither browser supports displaying 10-bit colour.
[00:14:38] <pe> Safari does, but it's Safari.
[00:15:16] <bparker> pe: are you saying Chromium doesn't support 10-bit color?
[00:15:23] <bparker> not sure which 2 you're referring to
[00:15:32] <pe> Yes, it does not.
[00:15:44] <bparker> then what about this https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=445071

[00:16:35] <bparker> give several reasons why
[00:17:09] <pe> It will not display a 16-bit PNG.

[00:18:05] <bparker> video can still have 10-bit color though, so saying Chromium can't support that at all seems disingenuous.
[00:18:43] <bparker> and what makes any of this 'laughable' ?

[00:19:34] <pe> The bit about suggesting dithering at the beginning.
[00:19:49] <pe> But I see the issue evolved since then.
[00:20:09] <pe> Well.
[00:20:20] <pe> It's still possible that it doesn't support it at all.
[00:20:23] <bparker> so you consider dithering instead of not playing at all... laughable?
[00:20:44] <pe> It ignores my problem.
[00:20:55] <bparker> ok
[00:21:35] <pe> I wonder if I can find a good video sample...
[00:22:12] <bparker> apparently one can set the canvas pixelFormat as 'float16' to get support already ?

[01:21:48] <bparker> you must re-create all state on every frame

[01:22:00] <bparker> well, 'simple' is relative
[01:22:01] <pe> I'm thinking of something MacPaint/MS Paint-alike.
[01:22:08] <pe> Which people never replicate accurately.
[01:22:10] <bparker> many users would consider a parametric undo function to be 'simple'
[01:22:24] <companion_cube> bparker: but that's the point
[01:22:34] <bparker> demize: Viktor Navorski?
[01:22:35] <companion_cube> you don't need to keep track of callbacks

[01:23:25] <demize> Therefore I am at war.
[01:23:29] <bparker> just the very nature of implementing an undo function when you didn't design for that feature from the beginning... necessitates a massive re-work of your code in most cases
[01:23:56] <bparker> because now you must keep track of OLD state too
[01:24:13] <bparker> e.g. what were those 50 sliders set to before operation X happened ?
[01:24:21] <bparker> and how can you set them all back when the user clicks undo
[01:24:30] <bparker> and then make the image reflect all those changes too
[01:24:33] <bparker> it's quite complex
[01:24:34] <riv> yeah, if you haven't planned for taht it's going to be hard
[01:26:36] <technomancy> must be rough coding without immutable data structures =)

[01:36:31] <technomancy> I think you lost me

[01:38:16] <companion_cube> flee, you fool
[01:38:43] <technomancy> well, I've also implemented undo without immutable data structures but I did it just by a ridiculously inefficient full copy
[01:38:50] <amazigh> companion_cube: how do you backtrack without copies nor immutable datastructures?
[01:39:03] <technomancy> it doesn't have to be hard if being stupid is an option
[01:39:44] <companion_cube> amazigh: every time you make a change, push an "undo" token onto a stack
[01:39:51] <companion_cube> containing just enough information to undo the change
[01:40:12] <technomancy> that sounds ... actually really difficult
[01:40:23] <companion_cube> idk what you consider difficult, but it works well
[01:40:23] <technomancy> unless you have a limited number of allowed operations
[01:40:26] <companion_cube> sure

[01:41:04] <companion_cube> yeah
[01:41:19] <companion_cube> event source but with a second stream to undo the first :)
[01:41:31] <amazigh> nitfty
[01:41:45] <companion_cube> for an editor you could go both ways: do X, push undo(X) on the other side
[01:41:52] <companion_cube> do undo(X), push X on the first side

[13:16:12] <mhw0> does anyone use irssi ?
[13:16:14] <wink> re not sure which one i it.
[13:16:27] <mhw0> I have some questions
[13:16:46] <wink> ask away, or try an irssi channel ;)
[13:16:48] <kline> wink, betteridges law of headlines
[13:16:51] <wink> I used to use it, but not anymore
[13:16:57] <wink> kline: thanks.
[13:17:58] <iDrougge> wink: Esprit d'escalier?
[13:18:51] <defect> i've used irssi for a while, but also in a mostly vanilla config
[13:19:31] <wink> iDrougge: hmm, I don't think so. more like "I know this is a known pattern and if I could remember the name I could smartass-quote it, but I don't"
[13:19:45] <mhw0> why does irssi store passwords in the config file? This is not safe, is it ?
[13:19:56] <kline> iDrougge, i was thinking that as related
[13:20:32] <iDrougge> wink: Alzheimer's law.
[13:20:43] <gerikson> mhw0: probably because irssi is old and crufty
[13:20:54] <gerikson> I believe they are obfuscated in weechat
[13:21:06] <gerikson> plenty of unix tools store credentials in plaintext
[13:21:18] <gerikson> you are supposed to set the file to read-only by your user
[13:21:26] <wink> it's also not the end of the world unelss you publish your dotdfiles :P
[13:21:30] <defect> mhw0: as safe as your system and it's privilege separation is i'd say
[13:21:38] <mhw0> I tried weechat but it's a bit confusing
[13:21:55] <jmiven> gerikson: not by default in weechat. I suspect it's the same for irssi
[13:22:20] <mhw0> gerikson: how old ?
[13:22:49] <gerikson> jmiven: ok thanks, I might be misremembering it
[13:23:29] <defect> probably a bit hard for the client to ensure any security as different networks have different ways of authenticating?
[13:23:49] <jmiven> or it might have happened recently. My weechat config files are a bit old...
[13:24:23] <mhw0> hmm..
[13:25:06] <gerikson> yeah some auth methods involve slinging a text string over the network

[13:26:02] <mockturtle> [ Stop storing passwords in plaintext · Issue #6 · irssi/irssi ] - github.com

[13:27:05] <gerikson> I've started using certs more an more
[13:27:30] <mhw0> git also stores tokens in the .git/config file without any encryption
[13:28:42] <mhw0> gerikson: Oh I see
[13:28:43] <iDrougge> defect: A lot of web pages have different ways of authenticating, yet your web browser's password manager doesn't store passwords in plain text.
[13:29:03] <defect> iDrougge: but it's still generally a HTTP POST, right?
[13:29:34] <iDrougge> That's very general. What's inside the POST?
[13:30:38] <defect> at some point you need to decrypt whatever is in your password manager to use it. are you thinking irssi should implement a general password manager?
[13:31:22] <iDrougge> Doesn't it already do that, just in plain text?
[13:32:09] <mhw0> I mean they could use for example: Gnome keyring on gnome, keychain access on macos..

[13:33:45] <wink> I find keyring to be one of the worst implementations for this
[13:33:51] <mhw0> there's an open source library called "libsecret"
[13:33:54] <wink> esp. if you regularly ssh into that box
[13:35:02] <defect> i'm not arguing it couldn't do that, but maybe it's out of scope for an irc client? if i were that worried about my irc creds i'd keep them in my password manager
[13:36:50] <mhw0> hm
[13:37:41] <wink> reading that issue just means no one is willing to accept /a/ solution, in search of a very good one
[13:37:43] <gerikson> ideally, maybe, there should be a username/password prompt
[13:37:49] <iDrougge> wink: Sounds like Irsii invented something even worse than Keyring.
[13:37:59] <wink> they didn't invent anything, that's the thing
[13:38:13] <wink> no one solved the problem in 7 years
[13:38:32] <wink> the one person arguing against includes gridns my gears, the rest is perfectly excusable
[13:38:47] <wink> I'm not taking requests what to implement in my spare time either
[13:39:05] <defect> do i have gnome-keyring on my box? i'm not even sure
[13:39:09] <wink> but it's a shame, config includes usually solve a whole lot of problems
[13:39:20] <mhw0> defect: do you use gnome ?
[13:39:22] <defect> no
[13:39:46] <defect> do i have anything else that libsecret supports? i dunno
[13:40:03] <defect> seems kinda gnome-centric
[13:40:14] <gerikson> mhw0: I've tried to make weechat more like irssi

[13:40:51] <defect> and how do you manage passwords gerikson ?
[13:41:05] <defect> for irc networks i mean
[13:41:25] <gerikson> I just have them in the config files
[13:41:41] <gerikson> it's not a high-risk scenario for me
[13:42:13] <mhw0> would be cool if they add vim key bindings to irssi

[19:37:09] <iDrougge> It's essentially just a rebranded FreeBSD. Apple have added nothing of importance anywhere in MacOS.
[19:37:23] <companion_cube> you know, except the whole UI layer
[19:38:31] <iDrougge> I think it's more correct to regard the BSD part as a subsystem than a defining part of the operating system.
[19:43:30] <feoh> Umm
[19:43:55] <feoh> You're focusing on one tiny slice of the pie
[19:44:09] <feoh> There's a WHOLE LOT that Apple builds up over that FreeBSD userland running on the Mach microkernel.
[19:44:52] <ols> I would agree, but calling macOS a BSD is much like (though not identical) calling Solus a "Linux" distro

[22:18:19] <feoh> Heh!
[22:19:18] <feoh> I have no real data for this but I've been wondering lately if the prevailing "MEH. BEEN DONE BEFORE. NEEEXXXTTTT!" dismissive attitude in elite tech circles ends up snuffing out multitudes of promising projects before they ever see the light of day.
[22:19:43] <technomancy> feoh: I have no problem with the person who made the static site generator
[22:20:07] <technomancy> feoh: it's the guy who thought "hey I'm going to post this on lobsters because it's newsworthy somehow" who needs to think things thru a little more
[22:20:33] <technomancy> also it's only tagged "clojure" and I don't want to hide that tag!
[22:20:43] <wink> it is very referential to the other ssg post 2w ago though
[22:20:45] <feoh> Oh absolutely

[22:20:55] <wink> also I posted about my ssg on lobste.rs as well :D
[22:20:55] <feoh> Like, I think back to the way computing was when I first got into it in the 80s and it was like Hey WOW you guys these things are AMAZING aren't they look what we can do? Hey I did this thing! Wow! And today a lot of what I see is people taking pot-shots at things because they can and because it makes them feel superior.
[22:20:57] <wink> so I mgith be biased
[22:21:48] <feoh> What's interesting is that spirit still exists TO THIS DAY in those 8 bit communities
[22:22:30] <feoh> Like, somebody does something cool with their Atari 8 bit or Apple or C64 and all 100 of us who are still around world wide read about it and almost universally are supportive.
[22:22:31] <companion_cube> feoh: the static site generator thing is a meme at this point
[22:22:36] <technomancy> it still exists on IRC too

[23:23:11] <feoh> So, a bunch of people in the lobsters community have posted a bunch of comments around readability and blogs. Are there any actual standards out there for what's readable and what's not? Or is it just another opportunity to kvetch? :)
[23:23:32] <pe> Apparently my font is not.
[23:23:51] <feoh> heh
[23:24:26] <pe> If you want OPINIONS, I hate low contrast, thin-stroked fonts and non-white backgrounds
[23:24:44] <pe> Also monospace.
[23:26:50] <epilys> inter is very readable
[23:26:56] <kline> those are all fairly objective
[23:27:10] <kline> other than the non-white bit, but only partly
[23:27:13] <feoh> What is special about a white background? Just curious. I keep my terminal black with white text.
[23:27:39] <feoh> I'm partially blind and need as much contrast as I can get, so I am absolutely not normative where readability is concerned
[23:27:47] <kline> generally high contrast, sufficient weight (but no extremes either way), non-monospace
[23:28:03] <kline> for colour, slightly off from white and slightly greyer than black is best
[23:28:51] <technomancy> dark backgrounds are harder to read when there's a lot of ambient light, such as when using your computer outdoors
[23:29:02] <feoh> Oh that's absolutely true
[23:29:39] *** Quits: ugjka (~ugjka@ugjka.net) (Quit: Rabooting the server https://ugjka.net)
[23:30:07] <feoh> I don't know why but I personally find slightly off black bg and slightly off white text causes me the least eyestrain, but I don't claim that equates to it being 'readable' by most folks.
[23:30:12] *** Joins: ugjka (~ugjka@ugjka.net)
[23:30:40] <feoh> I generally always pick the dark theme and not just because it's in vogue right now :)
[23:30:54] <kline> generally anything super-saturated is difficult
[23:31:03] <feoh> Anyway, OK. I can definitely live with those constraints thanks.
[23:31:13] <kline> especially complementary colours
[23:36:23] <pe> kline: for me, dark backgrounds are objectively very hard to read.
[23:36:33] <pe> Though gray on gray works.
[23:36:42] <kline> i mean
[23:36:45] <kline> thats subjective
[23:36:51] <kline> "for me, x"
[23:37:00] <pe> Ah, right.
[23:37:29] <pe> When it's bright on black, all the letters create afterimages and I can't read anything.
[23:38:24] <kline> yeah, i get bands of luminance desense when i read for too long of too-bright on too-dark
[23:39:12] <kline> full white on black after a few mins if i look at a plain field i can see stripes of blurred bright and dark, and it makes looking at stuff annoying
[23:40:29] <feoh> Seems like what you folks said, slightly off white background, slightly off black text is ideal for readability. Dark mode being an eyestrain reducer is also a thing but seems unconnected.
[23:40:44] <pe> It's not ideal, it's torelable.
[23:40:58] <pe> More like really gray on gray.
[23:41:11] <feoh> Wait, what does that mean? Gray text on a gray background?
[23:41:21] <companion_cube> why would the text be gray
[23:41:32] <companion_cube> black text on a slightly off white background is the best, imho
[23:41:35] <pe> Colours I wouldn't call white nor black.
[23:41:48] <feoh> Right, so off white
[23:41:49] <feoh> and off black
[23:41:56] <feoh> We're saying the same thing :) Thanks.
[23:42:09] <pe> It's subjective, but I don't think so.
[23:42:20] <technomancy> according to http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/ it's better to use something lighter than black
[23:42:21] <feoh> OK then you're not being clear. Got an example to show?

[23:42:44] <feoh> It's got fuck in the name. It's GOT to be good!
[23:43:05] <companion_cube> maximum contrast is good, but full white background is too bright, so you got to use off white background
[23:43:13] <companion_cube> I don't see why the text needs to be gray.
