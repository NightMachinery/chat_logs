[01:10:08] <phrik> Quite possibly. Why do you ask?
[01:10:42] <chazy> i open a proxy using ssh, i check with firefox and it works fine, but when i configure it in qbittorrent (type socks5 host 127.0.0.1 and port) i have no DHT nodes

[01:14:52] <victoryscreech> My guess without more information is that your traffic is being filtered by some smart network information security system
[01:15:13] <jushur> ive done this with a local server, 65MB/sec. none of the vps/aws/az i have access to allows this, heavily trottled if not blocked.. as it should be.

[01:16:28] <jushur> no you do not, you have control of the virtual instance. they still limit things.

[21:30:34] <MrElendig> but to be fair simd is a mess on arm too
[21:30:36] <demize> I think it's a bit weird to call it bad because it's mean to be flexible and support very limited usecases in addition to general-purpose ones.  For anything where you would reasonably expect to be able to run the same binary across chips you'd be wanting a G chip anyway.
[21:30:51] <gannymac> if I have some packages in my ignore list (like postgresql or something), is it still considered a "partial upgrade" when I do pacman -Syu?
[21:31:04] <demize> gannymac: Yes.
[21:31:13] <demonicmaniac> arm was bad with that but isn't anymore since they made quite a few things mandatory with v8 at least
[21:31:22] <MrElendig> gannymac: don't expect postgres to actually work after doing that
[21:31:26] <demonicmaniac> still not great but much better than it was
[21:32:12] <MrElendig> gannymac: if you don't want to upgrade postgres, running it in a container is probably a better choiuce
[21:32:13] <demonicmaniac> demize it's fine for aplication specific micros with a minimum required instruction set but not for general purpose computers i meant
[21:32:47] <gannymac> k, thanks. I usually only temporarily ignore postgresql, until I want to take the time to upgrade. But on some other apps, sometimes there are regressions (like an audacity version about 1.5 years ago broke some shit)
