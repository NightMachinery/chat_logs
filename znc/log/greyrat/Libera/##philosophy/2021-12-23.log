[01:12:33] *** Joins: random-jellyfish (~random-je@user/random-jellyfish)
[01:13:24] <audrey> Not my fault if people want to blow $$$ on overpriced stuff from Apple :|
[01:14:32] <biys> his claim is that the model apple uses shouldn't exist
[01:14:39] <biys> because apple doesn't allow right to repair
[01:15:00] <biys> when the fact of the matter is... as a result of the hardware being as compact as it is... the right to repair isn't really possible
[01:15:15] <biys> a lot of the components are glued together in order to maintain the small footprint
[01:15:35] <biys> but I_Am_M00t seems to suggest that companies like Apple shouldn't exist because it's unjust tactics
[01:15:44] <biys> my position is... no one is forcing peopel to buy apple products
[01:16:55] <audrey> I mean I never understood the appeal of Apple to begin with
[01:16:55] <biys> this is actually one of the only positions i've ever seen I_Am_M00t actually take on anything
[01:17:10] <audrey> It made sense back in the 1990s when Microsoft products were a dumpster fire and Linux was in its infancy
[01:17:39] <audrey> These days? Why spend $$$ for overpriced equipment that will decay at a faster rate than cheap Taiwanese laptop.
[01:18:03] <biys> so for some reason facebook has started showing me tons of videos about the bandidos and the exicutioners.  making claims that a lot of the police forces in the USA are over-run with gangs
[01:18:12] <biys> i've never "liked" anything on facebook
[01:18:29] <biys> yet suddenly almost every video in my FB feed is anti-police
[01:18:48] <biys> executioners
[01:19:44] <biys> audrey: as far as i'm concerned it is unlikely that any of the components in any of the electronics we use are obtained ethically
[01:19:49] <audrey> biys: I mean, this is the American propaganda machine hard at work
[01:19:59] <biys> so if we're going to have problems with electronics we should probably just stop using them all together
[01:20:00] <audrey> Noam Chomsky permanently jaded me on US media.

[01:21:42] <audrey> One of the consequences of living in a wealthy society is that it's almost impossible for that wealthy society to have been established in what we'd consider an "ethical" manner.

[01:26:21] <biys> can you speak russian?
[01:26:24] <audrey> Anyway, if you look deeply enough you'll see that almost everyone has "blood on their hands", indirectly, who lives in a Western society
[01:26:36] <audrey> yes, Russian is my first language

[01:26:46] <biys> crazy, i didn't know that

[01:28:52] <biys> in canada it seems as though all the aboriginal groups pretty much blame settlers for the mass murder that took place
[01:29:13] <biys> yet there's tons of history that shows that tribers were sourced to kill other tribes
[01:29:23] <biys> so it isn't like they don't have blood on their hands either

[01:29:46] <biys> yet when you mention stuff like that, around here anyways, you'll get lambasted
[01:30:14] <audrey> biys: I mean, in Polynesia, the Maori massacred the Moriori
[01:31:16] <biys> it does seem weird to me that some equity groups seem to be able to hide their...  historic wrongs
[01:31:31] <audrey> Now the Maori are considered a vulnerable group in New Zealand, similarly to the First Nations are in Canada.

[01:32:35] <audrey> ok, that is not correct but you get what I meant

[01:36:55] <biys> gotta be careful how far you take these conversations though
[01:37:05] <biys> even with the best intentions of understanding you'll be labelled

[01:38:19] <biys> i don't think there is anyone that, if you go back far enough, doesn't have blood on their hands in some way or another
[01:38:29] <audrey> I got outed in public by someone once who thought I had the wrong opinions for someone of my sexuality
[01:38:38] <audrey> In front of a lot of people.
[01:39:04] <audrey> Kind of silly, in retrospect. Now I just roll with it.

[01:42:45] <audrey> You have the food chain, and even the animals at the bottom of the food chain eat grass and plants.
[01:42:58] <biys> this is exactly my point when i talk with Ungwelian
[01:43:11] <biys> the world isn't fair
[01:43:13] <biys> it just isn't
[01:43:26] <biys> to think that it's supposed to be is weird.  which is why i keep expecting them to qualify their position
[01:43:34] <biys> and try and shorten their brush strokes a bit
[01:43:39] <biys> but they refuse
[01:43:42] <biys> so we're at an impass
[01:45:13] <audrey> I've been a vegetarian my entire adolescent/adult life, and of course I get annoying people trying to ask "gotcha" questions about it. (Ranging from silliness like "Hitler was a vegetarian!" to "But you live in a society(tm). How Interesting(R)."
[01:45:55] <audrey> I'm fully aware that merely to exist involves a certain kind of violence, in a very broad/cosmic sense.
[01:46:32] <audrey> Even the Jains, who wear cloths over their mouths to avoid ingesting insects, and sweep the path in front of themselves so as not to step on a living creature, and practice ahimsa in a maximal form
[01:49:07] <biys> i did not know that
[01:49:08] <biys> hahaha
[01:49:09] <audrey> So it's really up to you to decide what level of this "cosmic violence" is an acceptable limit for you.
[01:49:09] <biys> the Jains
[01:49:12] <biys> that's insane
[01:49:30] <audrey> There's always suicide I suppose, but that seems quite violent in itself.
[01:50:02] <audrey> The author of Ecclesiastes was correct, I think - best to have never been born into the bloodbath they call life.
[01:50:17] <audrey> That's cold comfort to those of us who are already around, though.
[01:50:54] <Delf> biys: It brings comfort, the idea of fairness
[01:51:21] <biys> comfort?  or is it simply virtue signaling?
[01:51:41] <biys> cause if they truly believed the doctrine they speak they'd likely not be on a computer
[01:51:47] <Delf> Probably both

[09:34:56] <audrey> biys: (unrelated) I was reading this article when I remembered our earlier conversation about the highly ambiguous meaning of "conservative". It occurred to me this might very well be used to describe "feminism", or various feminisms, plural, as the case may be. https://unherd.com/2021/12/the-feminist-case-against-abortion/
[09:34:57] <ro-bot-o> [url] The feminist case against abortion - UnHerd | unherd.com
[09:36:33] <audrey> Definitions change over the decades. A hundred years ago it was considered progressive to be pro-eugenics, now it's the diametrical opposite. I wonder whether "conservative", "liberal", "leftist" etc. are undergoing a similar semantic shift.
[09:36:52] <audrey> And we are just slow to catch on, and this results in confusion or cognitive dissonance.

[10:03:11] <sweetsymphony> Hmm
[10:07:07] <sweetsymphony> It is a bit like a certain portion or men do expect sex when dating even if they haven't decided if they want kids, happy to tell women to go on the pill or get abortions depending on if they as men want a baby or not
[10:07:56] <sweetsymphony> So in a way it is liberating for women to control their fertility but sometimes if it is controlled by a man then it isn't her deciding at all
[10:08:56] <sweetsymphony> So like some expectations of some portion of men around that
[10:09:06] <sweetsymphony> Like in the article when it says...
[10:09:53] <sweetsymphony> “Voluntary motherhood” advocates worried that far from protecting women, contraceptive technologies would make it more difficult for women to refuse unwanted sexual contact, liberating men to exploit and even rape women without fear of practical consequences.
[10:12:36] <sweetsymphony> Woman can't use "but I don't want to get pregant" as an excuse as easy when the man just says, "but I have condoms" "just go on the pill then" some portion happy to manipulate, use or at worse rape women with no or low risk of pregnancy or any repercussions to them
[10:17:24] <plankton> last person i was hooking up with told me to cum inside em without a condom and it freaked me out
[10:17:27] <sweetsymphony> Actually the words, "I don't want to get pregnant",should stop the man cos contraception doesn't always work but, fair portion of men are super pushy to women
[10:18:03] <sweetsymphony> Oh...she wanted to have your baby plankton by the sound of it??
[10:18:10] <plankton> nah just kinky
[10:18:17] <sweetsymphony> Oh
[10:18:23] <plankton> it was our thirs time hooking up
[10:18:24] <plankton> third
[10:18:55] <plankton> i was like wtf and they said they could just take plan b
[10:18:56] <sweetsymphony> Oh
[10:19:01] <plankton> im like thats a terrible idea
[10:19:10] <sweetsymphony> Very terrible idea
[10:19:36] <plankton> were not seeing each other any more
[10:19:40] <sweetsymphony> Oh
[10:19:42] <sweetsymphony> Sorry
[10:19:47] <plankton> s'alright
[10:20:17] <sweetsymphony> Probably better just to sleep with people you would raise a family with imo if they got pregnant
[10:20:27] <sweetsymphony>  But humans...
[10:20:31] <sweetsymphony> Eh
[10:22:00] <plankton> ewww no thanks
[10:24:18] <sweetsymphony> You qant to sleep qoth women you couldn't see yourself raising a family with?
[10:24:23] <sweetsymphony> Or just don't want kids?

[17:06:01] <sweetsymphony> Are skinny dipping in the forest one day. Joking and talking philosophy and such. Suddenly they hear a large group of locals walking down the path toward them. To their dismay, they realized that they left their clothes hanging on branches on the other side of the path and would have to run past everyone to get them.
[17:06:01] <sweetsymphony> The minister gets out of the water, covers his junk and runs as fast as he can past the oncoming people to get his clothes.

[17:06:02] <sweetsymphony> As they dress the priest turns to the rabbi and asks,
[17:06:03] <sweetsymphony> "Why did you cover your face and not your genitals?"

[18:39:37] <audrey> It seems the main motivation from contemporary (2nd and 3rd wave) feminism to endorse abortion, is to remove that imbalance.
[18:39:47] <audrey> Which is basically the gist of the article I posted yesterday evening.
[18:40:01] <darklambda> is it applicable if safe sex is practiced?
[18:40:23] <amigojapan> Hi darklambda
[18:40:31] <darklambda> heya amigojapan
[18:40:32] <arryana> i find it rather imbalanced that doctors won't sterilize a woman who asks until she's had children, but a man can get a vasectomy without having had kids
[18:41:12] <audrey> Though I sometimes think this underestimates the physical exhaustion/pain that many abortion methods can inflict upon the adult woman, esp. in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters.
[18:41:24] <amigojapan> darklambda: condoms are like 99 precent effective. That means if 100 people have sex, one will end up pregnant
[18:41:25] <audrey> So even then it's not really as easy as for the man to "walk away".
[18:41:53] <audrey> darklambda: There isn't really such a thing as safe sex, only "safer sex". Contraceptives have failure rates so this is always a risk, even if a small one.
[18:42:00] <audrey> (Unless you're a homosexual. Then all bets are off. :DD)
[18:42:48] <darklambda> i heard some people test it by pouring water first to see if there's any hole
[18:43:29] <audrey> I mean it's not just manufacturing defects, but making sure it's worn properly throughout the sexual act
[18:43:32] <amigojapan> darklambda: they also sometimes just burst
[18:43:40] <arryana> that still doesn't protect a woman if it breaks.  or if any number of other things happen
[18:43:50] <arryana> and the pill is not a guarantee
[18:44:14] <audrey> actual failure rates are normally higher than the theoretical failure rate, mostly because people have trouble focusing on "perfect usage" when they are in the middle of sexual heat
[18:45:29] <amigojapan> They are also not designed to put water in then first
[18:45:47] <darklambda> lol
[18:46:09] <darklambda> oh well
[18:46:25] <audrey> It occurs to me this is one thing I will never have to worry about. puts on sunglasses
[18:46:27] <audrey> :P
[18:46:34] <arryana> haha
[18:46:38] <amigojapan> darklambda: usually they contain lubricant
[18:46:48] <darklambda> ah
[18:47:00] <audrey> But yeah. I think the most "foolproof" method is the copper coil, but a lot of women have bad reactions to it.
[18:47:05] <darklambda> so if one puts water.. that will wash that away
[18:47:25] <darklambda> copper coil? is that a thing
[18:47:38] <darklambda> sounds hurtful
[18:47:43] <arryana> i seem to recall that if someone -does- manage to get pregnant with the coil in it can cause all sorts of problems
[18:47:49] <arryana> medical emergency sort
[18:48:00] <arryana> but i'm not an expert
[18:48:01] <audrey> There's also fancy new stuff like injected pellets (which would freak me out) that secrete special fluids to stop periods
[18:48:21] <audrey> arryana: Ectopic pregnancy? (where the fertilized egg develops outside the womb)
[18:48:22] <arryana> the arm implants?
[18:48:28] <audrey> Yeah, arm implants is what I mean
[18:48:48] <arryana> that too, but i think it's also possible that there can be a uterine pregnancy even with th3e coil
[18:48:58] <audrey> I guess short of complete sterilization or homosexuality there isn't an ironclad way to fool nature
[18:49:17] <arryana> i know a woman who used to leave her norplant in even when it was expired, to try to trap a man with pregnancy
[18:49:22] <arryana> that's some low behavior, right there
[18:49:26] <audrey> :(
[18:49:54] <darklambda> unless different position maybe... but i guess most go for conventional ones

[18:56:44] <biys> they don't trust the government
[18:56:48] <biys> they've lost faith in the establishments
[18:56:51] <biys> "where's my bail out"
[18:57:26] <biys> s/establishments/establishments and institutions/
[18:57:26] <ro-bot-o> biys meant to say: they've lost faith in the establishments and institutions
[18:58:24] <audrey> It never ceases to amaze me how the historically working-class parties (Democrats in the US, Labor in the UK, NDP in Canada) managed to alienate the working class
[18:58:47] <audrey> The working poor in East Dallas, TX now all vote Republican. This would have been laughable 20 years ago.
[18:58:55] <biys> the thing about it is...  the working class is considered "stupid"
[18:58:57] <biys> they aren't educated
[18:59:06] <biys> they're trades folk, generally speaking
[18:59:11] <biys> blue collar
[18:59:21] <biys> so the idea is they aren't smart enough to run a country
[18:59:27] <biys> or have any say in how the country is to operate
[18:59:31] <biys> which causes a lot of resentment
[18:59:53] <biys> my wifes family is all educated
[18:59:59] <biys> doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc
[19:00:13] <biys> my family is all blue collar, farmers, service workers
[19:00:33] <biys> i've actually been considered a class traitor and a race traitor

[19:01:53] <biys> the anti vax sentiments make sense to me though
[19:02:04] <biys> the flat earth sentiments make sense to me
[19:02:04] <audrey> I've been called a "gay traitor". :P It seems like a great way of being emotive without saying anything meaningful.
[19:02:22] <biys> it's essentially the idea that the institutions and the govenrment can't be trusted
[19:02:29] <biys> ebcase time and time again they've shown they can't
[19:03:02] <audrey> Mostly because I keep on insisting that it's class differences, not sexuality or even race differences, that are the driver of conflict and social strife
[19:03:21] <biys> that is correct, i'd reckon anyways
[19:03:36] * arryana goes to baste christmas eve-eve turkey
[19:03:38] <audrey> I've said this before but I was always under the impression that this was a core tenet of most left-of-center political positions
[19:03:50] <audrey> So it's jarring to me to see that this apparently places me in a "right wing" camp.
[19:04:06] <audrey> arryana: Mm! Sounds wonderful
[19:04:23] <biys> well... if there's anything i know about liberals
[19:04:38] <biys> they HATE blue collar folk
[19:04:50] <biys> and the liberals tend to be the "educated" folk
[19:04:58] <biys> they've goten their underwater basket weaving degrees
[19:05:19] <biys> and they think the problems of canada are as a result of the blue collar conservatives holding everything back
[19:06:41] <biys> the conservatives just simply don't trust anything the government says
[19:06:54] <biys> cause they know that as a result of any government changes, they'll just get taxed more
