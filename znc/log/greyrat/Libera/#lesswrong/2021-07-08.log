[01:04:00] <dbohdan> Yeah
[01:05:19] <catern> also, what's up with the bizarre 20% drop in gen Z over the course of 4 years? I don't think they suddenly en-masse became atheists

[01:05:52] <catern> it would be more interesting to see this graph in three dimensions: time, percentage believing in god, and birth year
[01:06:04] <gwern> catern: you haven't noticed the whole great-awokening thing?
[01:06:17] <catern> rather than this artificial merging into generations
[01:06:54] <catern> gwern: hm, you think that's making people atheists/doubt in god? it doesn't seem like religion is a major target of that...
[01:07:08] <catern> and 20% is a *big* drop
[01:07:09] <gwern> it's a substitute. also, regular religion is a major target
[01:07:17] <catern> (in 4 years)
[01:08:18] <kuudes> dbohdan, gen x trend there is vague, could be nonexistent
[01:08:43] <kuudes> fitting a constant horizontal line would not need much more error
[01:09:11] <gwern> gss always has issues with sample size and power, unfortunately
[01:09:25] <kuudes> yes, I would put into that also the gen z thing
[01:09:27] <gwern> so you need to smooth and regress back to the mean
[01:09:33] <kuudes> maybe lowering but likely not that much, only 3 samples
[01:09:50] <kuudes> yeah
[01:09:51] <gwern> is it really 20%? it's more probably smaller than larger, of course, but still >0%
[01:10:06] <kuudes> yes, likely >0% but presumably <20%
[01:10:42] <kuudes> I guess one could try to estimate the error function from those other series and use that to fit and presume larger error because of lower n?
[01:11:54] <kuudes> I would first transform the data to inverse logistic or inverse gaussian space so that it would go between -inf to +inf instead of 0 to 1, as that should make the error to be, whatsit, somehow well distributed
[01:12:16] <kuudes> the estimate the gaussian that would match the error, likely using the sample size formula

[02:47:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> "After posting a preliminary tabulation of ranked-choice results online on June 29 as scheduled, the New York City Board of Elections issued a tweet stating a discrepancy had been identified in the results. Shortly thereafter, the results were taken down from the Board's website and replaced with a message promising new preliminary results would be made available the following day. Later the night of June 29, the Board
[02:47:08] <Obormot\Arcturus>  released a statement explaining that approximately 135,000 test votes‚Äîroughly 14.3% of the reported total‚Äîhad been left in its ranked-choice tabulation system and that a new preliminary tabulation would be performed and released the following day.[7]"

[02:49:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure, totally, and this just happened to turn a clear win for one guy into a very close race that could've gone either way when the counting got done
[02:49:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Total coincidence
[02:49:48] <quanticle> This does raise a good point, though: the proponents of all these "fairer" voting systems like ranked choice or instant-runoff never seem to consider *who* will be implementing these complex balloting systems?
[02:50:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it's ok, they've "corrected" the "error" and now the right dude is in
[02:50:33] <quanticle> You heard the machine click and whirr, Obormot.
[02:50:50] <kuudes> is voting fraud common in usa btw?
[02:51:23] <quanticle> Depends on who you ask.
[02:52:32] <quanticle> The funny thing is that the sort of voting fraud that Obormot\Arcturus is pointing at would not be prevented in the slightest by the supposed "anti-voting fraud" measures that the Republicans are proposing. Asking voters to show ID? Great... but it's cold comfort if the database is rigged.
[02:52:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: The claim that voting fraud is common in the U.S. is an alt-right conspiracy theory, and you would do well to align your thinking on the matter with the good and correct people, lest someone get the wrong idea
[02:53:28] <quanticle> Well, the claim is voting fraud via fraudulent voters, which is a much narrower claim.
[02:53:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> But yeah the voter ID stuff is farcical
[02:53:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's like
[02:54:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> We got these electronic voting machines now, which means that voting is what? That's right: it's *software*
[02:54:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is supposed to fill us with confidence
[02:54:18] <quanticle> The electronic voting machines don't print out a hardcopy?
[02:54:31] <kuudes> don't they currently ask for id?
[02:54:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Maybe they do but then what? It's tabulated by computer, as you can see from what I quoted above
[02:54:57] <quanticle> Nope. You can just show up, state your name, and as long as you're on the rolls, you're allowed to vote.
[02:55:03] <kuudes> O_o
[02:55:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, there's no ID requirement
[02:55:30] <kuudes> how do they prevent people for voting as other people?
[02:55:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> They don't, lol
[02:55:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> There is actually no mechanism to prevent this
[02:55:48] <kuudes> why is this not a problem?
[02:55:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes please
[02:55:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> We have a DEMOCRACY
[02:55:59] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Yeah, but if there are hardcopies, you can ask for a hand-recount in the case of a suspicious result or discrepancies. Also, a paper copy allows the voter to make sure their actual vote did get recorded somewhere.
[02:56:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why would you question it
[02:56:23] <Betawolf> here you need to go to the right polling station for your area (quite small areas) but yeah otherwise just turn up
[02:56:34] <quanticle> Yeah, by the way, making people show ID to vote is "voter suppression" and "racist"
[02:56:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well yes same here, you gotta go to the right place
[02:56:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> They won't have your name on their list if you go to some unrelated county
[02:57:04] <kuudes> here there are no formal id requirements, but the voting council (the people from different parties on the other side of the desk) have to be ascertained who you are
[02:57:14] <kuudes> which is often not a problem in smaller areas
[02:57:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> But the only requirement is that (a) you're registered, (b) you go to a poll site in the ... district (? not sure) you're registered in, and (c) no one claiming to be you has voted yet
[02:57:57] <kuudes> usually this means you show them a driver's licence or passport or person id card - finally the police has the duty to ascertain who you are for free
[02:58:55] <saturn2> to register to vote (i.e. get on the list of names) you just need two other people to vouch for you
[02:59:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Anyhow, it's obvious that Eric Adams will be mayor
[02:59:16] <kuudes> you can also sort of vote-by-mail where you go in the previous week to any of the prior-voting places where there is another voting council who checks your identity and follows a procedure where you put your vote into an envelope that is stamped and then it is closed into another envelope with your confirmed id
[02:59:32] <Betawolf> the polling areas here are very small. Like, the small village I live in has two different ones. This would make it quite fiddly to impersonate someone who wasn't basically your neighbour.
[02:59:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: I don't know if there's even any point in going to vote in November. I probably will, just to make a point, but I have no illusions about the outcome
[03:00:07] <quanticle> Oh yeah, everyone realizes the Democratic Primary is the "true" election
[03:00:07] <kuudes> saturn2, hmm
[03:00:14] <feep> germany has formal id requirements
[03:00:21] <quanticle> That's why there's such a furore over the result
[03:00:33] <quanticle> Beacause whoever wins the primary is the presumed next mayor
[03:00:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah
[03:00:38] <kuudes> saturn2, indeed, you sort of don't have a formal list of who is a resident or a citizen there
[03:00:41] <feep> or rather, the german state bureaucracy knows where everyone lives, and you are mailed your voting papers
[03:00:52] <saturn2> kuudes: right
[03:01:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's no Bloomberg this time, nobody's gonna win without being a Democrat, and the relevant Democrat has already been selected
[03:01:31] <kuudes> feep, here we are mailed a notice that there is election which contains list of places where to vote near you, but the letter is not required to be with you when you vote, they only id you
[03:01:40] <quanticle> How did Bloomberg win, anyway?
[03:01:46] <quanticle> Just spent a lot of cash?
[03:02:21] <kuudes> they have trialed a mayor system here in finland in larger cities, but personally I have started to dislike it
[03:02:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> The city was less politically polarized then
[03:02:28] <kuudes> it focuses too much power into one person
[03:02:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> This was only 4 years after 9/11
[03:02:36] <kuudes> city board system is imo better
[03:02:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> The Democratic candidate was some asshole that nobody had any particular reason to like
[03:03:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> There was no strong racial angle like there is now
[03:03:07] <kuudes> ie then you have a city manager, but they are a public official, though at will of city council
[03:03:11] <quanticle> It's remarkable how, in the aftermath of World War 2, Germany didn't dismantle it's totalitarian citizen-tracking infrastructure at all, but was like, "You know, we'll just use this machinery for *good* rather than *evil*"
[03:03:24] <quanticle> s/it's/its/
[03:03:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> So Bloomberg just, you know, ran on the issues and on his own credentials
[03:03:36] <kuudes> but as public officials sort of have duties sometimes also not to obey illegal orders from city council etc, that makes more sense imo
[03:03:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like mayoral candidates are in theory supposed to do all the time
[03:04:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> He won by almost 20 points, too
[03:04:18] <kuudes> quanticle, I don't think that was that new. didn't france and germany have such systems already in 1800s or earlier?
[03:04:24] <saturn2> quanticle: presumably the americans and russians both wanted to keep it
[03:05:28] <quanticle> I don't think the Americans "wanted" to keep it, so much as they figured it would take too much time and effort to dismantle and hey the Soviets are *right there* we need a strong Germany to be a bulwark against the Red Menace.

[03:07:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yes, thank god
[03:07:46] <saturn2> always look on the bright side
[03:07:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Adams at least is a former cop
[03:07:55] <quanticle> But on the downside, no Andrew Yang :(
[03:08:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> He's probably as "law and order" as a Democrat can feasibly get these days
[03:08:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> So yeah, bright side
[03:09:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah, the 2001 election had some lols, I remember this now:
[03:09:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The election was also notable for two non-politician semi-celebrities running on third-party tickets: Bernhard Goetz, who had achieved fame in 1984 as the "subway vigilante" for shooting four young men who tried to rob him, on the Fusion Party ticket, and Kenny Kramer, who was the inspiration for the character Cosmo Kramer on the TV show Seinfeld, on the Libertarian Party ticket. "
[03:11:14] <saturn2> kramer was a real guy? lmao
[03:12:40] <quanticle> And of course he's running as a Libertarian

[04:42:20] <gwern> (the monetary costs of schizophrenia are staggering. the non-monetary costs, even more so. it's a pity we really have nothing better in the way of prevention than embryo selection, and only really nasty drugs for treating the symptoms poorly)

[04:50:54] <pie_> my family would probably be a lot better off if my father had managed my mothers schizophrenia better
[04:52:14] <pie_> its mind blowing that me getting her a private psychiatrist, so that she doesnt have to go out to visit the doctor (this may or may not be the causative factor in reality), has resulted in her staying on her meds and being in general vastly more stable

[04:53:47] <ggreer> one thing I don't get is the "it's an illness like heart disease or diabetes or whatever" I mean... yeah except it means the person is practically guaranteed to turn into a violent madman from time to time
[04:55:05] <ggreer> if someone has heart disease or diabetes, they're pretty normal. you can talk to them and go bowling or watch a movie or whatever. maybe they have to watch their diet and they can't go on a long hike with you, but generally they're fine

[04:58:10] <quanticle> er, not pretend otherwise, I meant
[04:58:14] <ggreer> but schizophrenia... nope. it's just a matter of time before they stop taking their meds (assuming meds can even treat them). then they go off the deep end and become more dangerous than most convicts

[05:28:28] <kuudes> over here we appear to vaccinate about that many persons per year

[05:33:52] <ggreer> kuudes: my guess is that death rates have declined since the 70s. I mean they declined over the course of the data measured (up to 1994). it's definitely below 1 per 100k these days
[05:34:04] <PlanckWalk> kuudes: I have very little care for your opinion of me.
[05:34:08] <kuudes> ggreer, no, uk data talked of as high as 8/100k
[05:34:09] <[itchyjunk]> Something about it taking antigen and producing variants to make B cells against or some such?
[05:34:11] <rmmh> the chickenpox vaccine is really interesting 
[05:34:32] <kuudes> PlanckWalk, sure. but please mind that on this channel we do not tolerate talking bullshit that much as in many other places
[05:34:38] <rmmh> because if the vaccination rate isn't high enough you're likely to get *worse* outcomes since more people catch chickenpox as adults
[05:34:40] <PlanckWalk> Things I know, I know because I have studied it.
[05:34:50] <ggreer> and again, the 1 in 100k who die are not random samples. find the unhealthiest child in a group of 100,000 and you are going to find some really fucked up kid
[05:34:59] <PlanckWalk> I have also cross-checked against people who have professional credentials.
[05:35:13] <rmmh> so the UK doesn't vaccinate against chickenpox. The US has managed about 90% vax rate after 25 years
[05:35:14] <kuudes> sure, and I crosschecked with santa claus, there are bad kids
[05:35:20] <ggreer> obviously the vaccine is an improvement, but deliberate infection isn't nearly as risky as say.... taking your kid to a water park every weekend
[05:35:43] <rmmh> ggreer: and indeed rational vs them catching it as a young adult 
[05:35:48] <ggreer> yeah
[05:35:51] <PlanckWalk> As I said, if you don't like me stating something that I have researched and cross-checked, then can lump it.
[05:36:09] <kuudes> it seems dysrational to expose them to a disease rather than pay the couple of tenners for the vaccine
[05:36:12] <[itchyjunk]> Is there a immunity difference from a vaccine vs from the virus itself?
[05:36:19] <quanticle> I think death rates have gone down from COVID too. We've figured out some treatments
[05:36:26] <quanticle> Like steroids and such
[05:36:26] <[itchyjunk]> I'd imagine there might be
[05:36:28] <rmmh> intentionally infecting your young children with chickenpox by going and playing with a sick kid was very common 
[05:36:28] <kuudes> yes they have, quanticle
[05:37:05] <kuudes> it was
[05:37:20] <[itchyjunk]> Better to get is as a kid than adult
[05:37:24] <kuudes> I think I have been done that way
[05:37:26] <[itchyjunk]> back in the day
[05:37:30] <kuudes> yes, but there are now vaccines
[05:37:34] <[itchyjunk]> Think i got measels that way?
[05:37:36] <kuudes> and some still do that. which is idiotic
[05:37:44] <kuudes> o_o
[05:37:53] <kuudes> hasn't there been a vaccine to measles since ages?
[05:37:57] <rmmh> [itchyjunk]: the vaccine is attenuated and it's a little different than natural infection https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31959424/
[05:37:58] <Robomot> Women who received varicella vaccine versus natural infection have different long-term T cell immunity but similar antibody levels - PubMed (Natural infection induced higher VZV-specific T cell immune responses than vaccination.)
[05:38:28] <[itchyjunk]> rmmh, oh i see, ty
[05:39:03] <[itchyjunk]> oh! nice. i had googled this topic but never came across this paper
[05:39:39] <[itchyjunk]> Is it valuable to then let a certain percent of population get naturally infected?
[05:39:57] <kuudes> quanticle, also cfr on covid was inflated at start, as mostly only serious cases got confirmed
[05:40:07] <PlanckWalk> Heh yes, 7%+
[05:40:08] <kuudes> but its current cfr is still high enough
[05:40:36] <[itchyjunk]> What is the current cfr?
[05:40:37] <kuudes> over 100/100k
[05:40:44] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[05:40:50] <kuudes> probably
[05:40:53] <kuudes> I am not an expert
[05:41:10] <PlanckWalk> It's still not really easy to get a good estimate of IFR
[05:41:16] <kuudes> iirc some proposed 150/100k and that was considered by some as very low figure
[05:41:30] <PlanckWalk> (I don't think CFR is a useful measure)
[05:43:01] <PlanckWalk> Well, not a useful measure for making population decision, without a lot of hedging and digging for details.
[05:45:02] <[itchyjunk]> How much does it vary regionally?
[05:45:11] <[itchyjunk]> Climate etc has any significant impact?
[05:45:29] <kuudes> unsure
[05:46:02] <PlanckWalk> I don't know.  Not enough to jump up out of the noise, so far at least.
[05:46:32] <PlanckWalk> There sure does seem to be a lot of noise. :-(
[05:46:53] <kuudes> microcovid seems quite good for practical life decisions, [itchyjunk]
[05:46:59] <kuudes> .g microcovid
[05:47:01] <feepbot> kuudes: https://www.microcovid.org/ 
[05:47:02] <quanticle> [itchyjunk]: I think there is, w.r.t. immunity difference. From what I've read, people who got infected seem to be more susceptible to variants than people who got the vaccine.
[05:47:05] <quanticle> Not sure why.
[05:47:31] <quanticle> Also, w.r.t. to chickenpox, if you've been infected, you're at risk for shingles as an adult. If you were vaccinated, you're fine, I think
[05:47:52] <gwern> https://twitter.com/grimacelover/status/1412941674095939589 the past is a foreign country

[05:48:10] <[itchyjunk]> oh interesting. didn't expect vaccine to produce a better immune response
[05:49:04] <quanticle> Well, the vaccine is specifically targeted towards viral proteins that are unlikely to mutate, whereas with a "natural" infection, who knows what your immune system is targeting?
[05:49:22] <gwern> https://twitter.com/ak92501/status/1412935479180279810 as usual, I'm left squinting at a diffusion paper abstract and going 'what the hell are you talking about'. this must be how it felt for ML professors around 2013

[05:49:51] <quanticle> What is "diffusion"?
[05:50:03] * Logos01 is now engaging in a demiscientific experiment.
[05:50:18] <[itchyjunk]> That makes sense. i was thinking that the immune system would get exposed to a variety of antigen under normal exposure while vaccine only exposes it to some specific protein
[05:50:23] <[itchyjunk]> but maybe that's not how it works
[05:50:29] <Logos01> I just filled my office humidifier about 25% of the way, and popped it into the freezer. 
[05:50:46] <quanticle> Are... are you trying to turn your humidifier into an airconditioner?
[05:50:48] <gwern> the only thing that gives me hope that diffusion is a fad that will pass is that there are thus far about zero connections to psychology, neuroscience, or biologically-plausible backprop
[05:50:49] <[itchyjunk]> What does that accomplish?
[05:50:59] *** Quits: CryptoDavid (uid14990@id-14990.highgate.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[05:51:00] <Logos01> The *goal* is to have icewater humidifier spray hit me while I'm working.
[05:51:10] <Logos01> And thus be encoolened.
[05:51:20] <gwern> quanticle: if I could really answer that, I wouldn't be so unhappy
[05:51:27] <Logos01> I do not know if I will instead destroy the humidifier reservoir, but the rest of the 'math' here checks out.
[05:51:44] <quanticle> gwern: Okay, what do you think diffusion is?
[05:51:46] <Logos01> Yes, this is the act of a man who is tired of it being 90*F inside his house. No, it is not entirely reasonable.
[05:51:58] <quanticle> Like, what is the ostensible purpose of diffusion?
[05:52:06] <[itchyjunk]> It's safe to freeze electronics?
[05:52:10] <gwern> quanticle: I don't know. I can parrot some of the descriptions but I don't understand them
[05:52:14] <quanticle> He's just freezing the reservoir
[05:52:18] <[itchyjunk]> ahh
[05:52:19] <quanticle> Not the part with the motor
[05:52:19] <Logos01> [itchyjunk]: The reservoir is just plastic.
[05:52:29] <[itchyjunk]> right, that makes more sense
[05:52:31] <Logos01> Once I do get the purchase of this house through I plan to take out the window screen on my office and install an in-window AC unit.
[05:52:36] <kuudes> should freezing be expected to damage general electronics?
[05:52:43] <quanticle> Condensation
[05:52:47] <Logos01> kuudes: quanticle++
[05:53:10] <gwern> like, on the raw algorithmic level, sure, I understand it. it's just a U-net where you add some noise to the input and train to predict the 'output'. but the math about how this is a distribution or bayesian inference or sampling from the data-generating distribution, f- me
[05:53:11] <Logos01> If you could somehow keep the electronics in a perfectly dehumidified container then freezing would still cause some issues.
[05:53:29] <Logos01> But not anything that would be permanent.  I've actually put my phone in the freezer a few times because reasons.
[05:53:41] <kuudes> phones work normally in winter though?
[05:53:57] <quanticle> gwern: Is it different from what you'd normally do to prevent overfitting?
[05:54:16] <Logos01> kuudes: Phones do not normally actually attain frozen temperatures, nor do they do so in locations that tend to ice over like a home freezer.
[05:54:17] <pie_> big brain <kuudes> phones work normally in winter though?
[05:54:31] <gwern> yeah, it's totally different. that's at most 1 step of noise, and auxiliary to your actual training objective
[05:54:40] <quanticle> kuudes: Have you ever left your phone in your car outside?
[05:54:42] <quanticle> I assure you
[05:54:45] <gwern> with diffusion, every step is training to add/remove noise. and that's it.
[05:54:46] <quanticle> It will not work normally
[05:54:46] <pie_> [itchyjunk]: my totally unfounded guess is that vaccines have higher specificity; this means stronger targeting, but also loss of target if it mutates?
[05:54:49] <pie_> how wrong am i
[05:54:52] <kuudes> O_o
[05:55:01] <Logos01> quanticle: You'll at least have to wait for it to warm back up.
[05:55:04] <Logos01> Even if it's waterproof.
[05:55:13] <kuudes> I have to test some of my old nokia someday
[05:55:16] <quanticle> Lithium ion batteries do not like cold
[05:55:22] <Logos01> kuudes: Nokia is a biased test.
[05:55:25] <Logos01> Nothing can stop nokias.
[05:55:35] <pie_> lol nokia is nordic
[05:55:38] <Logos01> <_<
[05:55:41] <pie_> surely it can withstand a little cold
[05:55:41] <kuudes> ...
[05:55:43] <kuudes> the ice is ice
[05:55:49] <Logos01> kuudes: But nokias are *nokias*.
[05:55:55] <Logos01> That's the keyterm there.
[05:56:11] <Logos01> I'm only being like 27% facetious.
[05:56:35] <gwern> 'In this section we expand on interesting connections between the D3PM framework and severalexisting probabilistic and language modeling approaches.BERT is a one-step diffusion model' ok I guess... 'Autoregressive models are (discrete) diffusion models:' ehhhhhhh '(Generative) Masked Language-Models (MLMs) are diffusion models:' OH COME ON
[05:56:40] <Logos01> If you made personal armor with an exterior layer of babies, a middle layer of nokias, and an inner layer of spidersilk -- you'd be utterly unstoppable.
[05:56:41] <[itchyjunk]> pie_, not sure. sounds reasonable 
[05:57:03] * [itchyjunk] wonders what diffusion models are
[05:57:05] <Logos01> The very minute fraction of things that would actually be willing to harm you would still be unable to project sufficient force to do so.
[05:57:38] <quanticle> Heck even the electronics in my car, which are supposedly *designed* to withstand cold temperatures... get a little wonky if I leave the car out in -20¬∫C weather for an extended period of time.
[05:57:58] <quanticle> There is a definite lag to the touchscreen that goes away as the car warms up
[05:57:59] <kuudes> isn't that just the battery thogh?
[05:58:08] <quanticle> No, this is after the car is running
[05:58:28] <kuudes> yes, but the battery voltage is still lower in cold
[05:58:30] <[itchyjunk]> I hear there is software that control acceleration and braking. electronics failing sounds bad.
[05:58:38] <kuudes> you will have to drive it some tens of kms before it gets normal
[05:58:52] <saturn2> capacitors and resistors change their values depending on the temperature
[05:59:00] <quanticle> kuudes: But the car isn't getting power from the battery then, it's getting power from alternator
[05:59:16] <kuudes> unsure
[05:59:33] <kuudes> isn't it mostly using the alternator to load the battery and expending power from the battery?
[05:59:49] <kuudes> I mean, the alternator electricity is more dirty than battery electricity
[06:00:03] <saturn2> LCDs take much longer to switch but i'm not sure that counts as "wonky"
[06:00:14] <quanticle> Well, it counts as laggy
[06:00:20] <saturn2> yes
[06:00:28] <quanticle> Also, I think the capacitive sensors might not work as well when it's cold
[06:00:48] <saturn2> the main problem i've had with cold cars has been plastic parts that get brittle and crack
[06:01:16] <kuudes> environment interacting electronics indeed can take offense for non-ntp conditions
[06:01:19] <quanticle> Maybe you should stop driving a... Saturn 
[06:01:21] <quanticle> lol
[06:01:37] <kuudes> but regular wires etc O_o
[06:01:40] <quanticle> saturn2 -> toyota2
[06:01:45] <quanticle> Problem solved
[06:02:21] <saturn2> this has actually happened to me on both a saturn and a toyota...
[06:02:21] <gwern> (my experience with saturns has been very positive)
[06:02:21] <kuudes> I mean, we were talking about an air humidifier
[06:02:28] <kuudes> it is not exactly rocket surgery
[06:03:21] <quanticle> I was just calling upon the "Hurr durr saturns are plastic cars lol" meme
[06:03:39] <saturn2> good luck finding a car with no plastic parts
[06:03:52] <saturn2> maybe a model T
[06:04:33] <kuudes> some lada maybe?
[06:06:53] <saturn2> anyway i made the mistake of opening the center console compartment when it was -30 or something. the hinge snapped off like a dry twig

[07:52:36] <gwern> hinting N+1?
[07:53:04] <gwern> by betting on contiguous pointers?
[07:53:08] <gwern> that doesn't sound very weird
[07:57:15] <gwern> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3987112/ hm. so there's definitely a lot of chemical differences between east asian/western earwax
[07:57:16] <Robomot> Identification of volatile organic compounds in human cerumen (We report here the initial examination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emanating from human earwax (cerumen). Recent studies link a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette, sub-family C, member 11 ...)
[07:57:45] <rmmh> beyond just the dry/waxy?
[07:57:57] <rmmh> isn't that linked to body odor
[07:59:57] <gwern> I wouldn't expect general body odor stuff to impact earwax, except as they both arise from the same underlying processes
[08:02:40] <gwern> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulcatone hm. a mosquito attractant?
[08:02:41] <Robomot> Sulcatone - Wikipedia (Sulcatone (6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one) is an unsaturated methylated ketone with the molecular formula C8H14O. It is a colorless, water-like liquid with a citrus-like, fruity odor.[2][3] ‚Ä¶)

It is a protein that in humans is encoded by gene ABCC11.[3][4][5] ‚Ä¶)
[08:03:15] <rmmh>  The phenotypes expressed by the genotypes include cerumen type (wet or dry ear wax), osmidrosis (odor associated with sweat caused by excessive apocrine secretion)
[08:07:59] <gwern> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propionic_acid hm. that one sounds pretty intriguing
[08:08:00] <Robomot> Propionic acid - Wikipedia (Propionic acid (/pro äpiÀà…ín…™k/, from the Greek words protos, meaning "first", and pion, meaning "fat"; also known as propanoic acid) is a naturally occurring carboxylic acid with chemical formula CH3CH2CO2H. It is a liquid with a pungent and unpleasant smell somewhat resembling body odor. ‚Ä¶)
[08:12:26] <gwern> it's a fatty acid. you have a lot of it in sweat due to bacteria (cats frequently will lick your sweat). it's not common in household products (so no behavior to observe or argument from silence). comes up a lot in cheese. benefits to supplementation, even...
[08:13:56] <gwern> end-product of ruminant digestion through the microbiome...
[08:17:24] <gwern> 'Pentanoic acid' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeric_acid !!!
[08:17:25] <Robomot> Valeric acid - Wikipedia (Valeric acid or pentanoic acid is a straight-chain alkyl carboxylic acid with the chemical formula CH3(CH2)3COOH. Like other low-molecular-weight carboxylic acids, it has an unpleasant odor. It is found in the perennial flowering plant Valeriana officinalis, from which it gets its name. Its primary use is in the synthesis of its esters. ‚Ä¶)
[08:17:37] <gwern> well shit! no one ever told me that earwax and valien overlapped!
[08:17:46] <gwern> wow
[08:17:49] <two2thehead> huh
[08:17:51] <gwern> who knew?
[08:17:57] <gwern> I think I just solved cat earwax
[08:18:06] <gwern> it was valerian all along. no wonder they flehmen
[08:18:53] <gwern> let's see... present in equal amounts in both types of earwax, so finding out if cats like asian earwax is very important since it'd falsify pentanoic acid
[08:21:19] <gwern> and yes, Oolong responds to valerian strongly, and is very interested in western earwax. the other cat does not respond to valerian and... is not interested in earwax
[08:24:24] <gwern> except... wait, the active ingredient in valerian is supposed to be actinidine. hm.
[08:25:42] <gwern> hartwell doesn't give a source for that, though, and it wouldn't be the first time people were wrong in cat psychoactives

[15:36:58] <PapuaHardyNet> gentlemen
[15:37:17] <PapuaHardyNet> I was thinking about the cryptocurrency exchange rise and I just hit upon this interesting analogy
[15:37:40] <PapuaHardyNet> isn't KYC (for legitimate users only), a form of Defect in a prisoner's dilemma?
[15:38:20] <dbohdan2> How so?
[15:38:51] <PapuaHardyNet> here I assume that for everyone, financial privacy is a good thing
[15:39:30] <PapuaHardyNet> since it is costly, both in time and crypto, to avoid KYC, people submit their financial details to be able to conveniently buy and sell cryptocurrency in centralized exchanges
[15:39:45] <PapuaHardyNet> however, this means they link their identities to their blockchain transactions
[15:40:22] <PapuaHardyNet> the common good is the global privacy of the blockchain. The more addresses that are directly linked to KYC, the easier it is for the network to be monitored
[15:40:58] <PapuaHardyNet> so people defect by giving up some privacy for convenience, and in exchange the global privacy of the blockchain is hampered
[15:44:45] <dbohdan2> If you model it this way, it is like the prisoner's dilemma on the single dimension of privacy

[20:34:30] <Robomot> When do you expect AGI? (When do you expect AGI?)
[20:34:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> "All those things aren't the fundamental part of the accountant's job, however.
[20:34:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> The main thing the accountant brings to the table is taking responsibility (and legal liability) for the calculations and their results. The accountant's sign-off is either required by law, or gives a measure of peace of mind to the client, if they're not obligated to retain a certified professional (but would prefer to entrust matters to one anyway).
[20:34:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Unless the legal context changes so that liability falls on the software itself (which would require recognizing programs as people) or the makers thereof, no software, no matter how sophisticated, will replace the human accountant."
[20:34:58] <gwern> "I never thought the tech leaps would eat *my* face!"
[20:35:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> This reads like parody but as far as I can tell this guy is serious!
[20:35:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Taking responsibility for the calculations!!!
[20:39:52] <rsaarelm> Even if AI technology were to continue improving, there will still be important work to be done in inventing justifications for the irreplaceability of human workers that an AI surely isn't able to replace humans in.
[20:41:09] <gwern> what's odd about that? there are loads of legal and fiducial requirements. I would be shocked if there weren't lots of requirements for CPAs to sign off on things
[20:43:17] <gwern> like auditing, or doctors, or lawyers. lots of guilds which take their cut
[20:51:00] <Betawolf> yeah, 'AI can't take my job because it'll be illegal' seems valid. I mean, their job is more of a sinecure by then but who cares.
[20:51:38] <adiabatic> sinecures pay the bills
[20:53:10] <rsaarelm> I'd imagine there'd be a lot of pressure to arrage it so we can go from a legally liable boss with 1000 legally liable accountant underlings to a legally liable boss with 1000 accountant AIs.
[20:53:49] <rsaarelm> Well, the boss basically becomes a single human accountant here.
[20:54:23] <rsaarelm> So either the accountancy gets replaced with a single person boutique company or it grows its business 1000x-fold.
[20:54:30] <Betawolf> it depends entirely on if there are any legal benefits to having another human between you and the fault
[20:55:14] <nshepperd> ai may be many things, but it will never be able to lend a truly human touch to digging holes and filling them in again
[20:55:23] <gwern> the problem there is that you may not want to accept liability across _n_ businesses. each one is an opportunity for an uncapped loss to blow you up
[20:55:35] <gwern> you can ask arthur anderson about that one
[20:56:13] <rsaarelm> Yeah, you'd need to have good diagnostics in the AIs to mitigate the risk.
[20:56:28] <nshepperd> accountants could be replaced with liability insurance
[20:56:43] <rsaarelm> I'd guess superhuman risk assessment won't be that hard.
[20:57:08] <rsaarelm> And insurers might be fine with insuring you if you are using the designated risk assessment AIs.

It took him, he said, only a few weeks.'...

[23:13:37] <ggreer> https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1413021267997995008 I'm guessing I won't get FSD until my car is over a year old
[23:13:38] <|dbotdan> Elon Musk (@elonmusk, 2021-07-08 06:24): ‚ÄòDepends on how the limited beta goes. If it goes well, maybe a month or so.‚Äô
[23:18:04] <saturn2> what's that in human months?
[23:20:52] <ggreer> no idea. they're definitely in development hell. they were rolling out new betas every few weeks, but then halted for 3-4 months
[23:22:29] <ggreer> the FSD betas from earlier this year can drive around with very few interventions. maybe one intervention every 150 miles (and only interventions on surface streets. driving on limited access freeways is solved)
[23:23:53] <ggreer> maybe they froze development of that stuff so they could get the new UI out for the plaid release. also they removed radar from a lot of their cars, so they probably did a ton of work to make sure current functionality (autopilot & FSD on freeways) works fine without radar
[23:24:47] <ggreer> honestly it's unprecedented just how few updates have come out in the past 6 months. I was getting new functionality every few weeks, then february came around and... nothing
[23:32:32] <ggreer> I think they should ship the current beta. thousands of people have been using it for 6-9 months. if it was less safe than a human driver, someone would have wrecked by now
[23:32:40] <Logos01> So I can't be entirely sure but based on suspicious sounds I just heard while walking by I am now of the belief that a bird has hatched her eggs in a nest in or underneath my swamp cooler on my roof.
[23:32:46] <Logos01> This seems untoward.
[23:33:21] <ggreer> sadly they have to wait until it's much safer than a human driver because the law of truly large numbers means they'll get bad press when someone inevitably does wreck
[23:33:29] <Logos01> I'm unsure how to rate this against the time I found a two year old tree sapling growing out of my house's swamp cooler.
[23:33:39] <ggreer> hell they get bad press when people wreck teslas while driving manually
[23:33:46] <Logos01> (That was a different house, and the evap cooler hadn't run in like two decades.)
[23:33:53] <ggreer> O_o
[23:34:48] <Logos01> The house had 'proper' HVAC so nobody maintained the casing. The sediment buildup from the water reservoir of the cooler combined with the moisture padding which was never removed acted as sufficient medium for the seed to take root in.
[23:35:25] <Logos01> And I just never looked at the roof of my house until one day: "Is ... that... that is a tree. There is a tree growing from the unit on top of my house. This is not how treehouses work."
[23:36:04] <Logos01> ggreer: It was a stunted conifer. Wasn't growing too well (shockingly).
