[00:22:29] <drakonis> japhb: basically, what i want is to compile raku code and execute it in another machine with a rakudo binary without needing to install the modules in the target and if i understand correctly, doing that should help?

[02:49:14] <drakonis> oh, hi.
[02:49:23] <drakonis> what's your goal for sparrow?
[02:49:50] <melezhik> hi patrickb thanks! yeah config files for CI are absolutely first thing to go, I just meat, my vision is this CI services should be as simple as possible and provides a A LOT of features out of the box, without necessity to code anything
[02:50:37] <melezhik> so, I would like to have a list of such features from Raku community , may be I'll need o create a reddit post or something )))
[02:50:39] <drakonis> you pinged the wrong person, but alright.
[02:50:44] <melezhik> hi drakonis
[02:51:25] <melezhik> I answered previous patrickb reply on my idea to start writing Raku focused CI server
[02:51:32] <drakonis> i see.
[02:51:36] <melezhik> NP ))
[02:52:15] <drakonis> i'm writing a automation framework, however it doesnt follow the kind of design you're going for
[02:52:27] <melezhik> drakonis are you interested in Sparrow, any specific questions? I don't have any specific vision for it right now, I just use it whenever it's possible and this makes my life easier , that is it
[02:52:49] <melezhik> cool! have you checked Sparrow documentation?
[02:53:40] <melezhik> also I use Sparrow as a low level framework to build more high level tools, services including Sparky, Tomtit, Tomty
[02:53:47] <melezhik> if this helps
[02:53:53] <drakonis> i've checked the code
[02:54:19] <melezhik> basically Sparrow is just all in one universal language agnostic engine with a Raku orchestrator on the top
[02:54:36] <drakonis> i see
[02:54:39] <melezhik> code, could be far from being ideal and optimal
[02:55:34] <melezhik> I encourage you to read the docs and posts ( which I have produced quite a number for the last X years, he-he ), maybe you'll borrow some my ideas and do better implementation ))))
[02:56:36] <melezhik> have you checked that? - https://raku-advent.blog/2020/12/07/mixing-bash-and-raku-using-sparrow/
[02:57:20] <melezhik> Sparrow's GH docs could be maybe tough to start with, these Raku advents and dev.to posts are more easier and friendly ))))
[02:57:37] <melezhik> anyway, I'd be happy to help you in anyways ...
[02:58:11] <drakonis> cool
[02:58:32] <drakonis> it does seem a bit more like the traditional automation tooling but with more syntax options
[02:58:38] *** Joins: zacts (~zacts@user/zacts)
[02:58:39] *** Quits: zacts (~zacts@user/zacts) (Client Quit)
[02:59:25] <melezhik> yeah, it's quite simple by users's API but it has some ( a lot of ) features that cover (many) cases
[03:00:17] <melezhik> you might be also interested in Sparky, which is a CI/integration ¬†server built on the top of Sparrow - https://github.com/melezhik/sparky#job-api
[03:01:03] <melezhik> the "latest and greatest" (sorry for showing off) feature is one can run distribute jobs ( Sparrow scenarios basically ) across clusters with VMs or docker instances
[03:01:46] <melezhik> anyway ... let me know if you have more specific questions or post your thought as GH issues )))
[03:01:55] <drakonis> no worries
[03:02:05] <drakonis> i think i'm going with something different for my own
[03:03:46] <drakonis> it does seem nice though

[03:47:48] <n1to> hi, can someone tell me how to use external libraries in the Comma IDE. I am using `rakubrew` and installed 'Color' with `zef`. Even though the IDE provides me with auto completion for Color it does not find the module with the use statement and fails with 'Cannot find Color in the ecosystem'. When I try it in the repl inside the IDE, it works though.

[04:13:06] <El_Che> n1to: normally in settings =>  languages you can set paths
[04:13:24] <El_Che> or set RAKULIB env variable
[04:25:57] <japhb> n1to: Couple possibilities that I can think of.  Have you added your current rakudo as an "SDK" for the project?  Also, have you added Color to your META6.json as a depends entry?
[04:31:02] <n1to> El_Che: I can't find the option in the settings, but I tried setting RAKULIB in the run configuration and via -I. Didn't seem to work. However I might set it to a wrong directory. I used '~/.rakubrew/versions/moar-2022.02/share/perl6/site/sources' as it was the only one I found the files for Color in it.
[04:34:45] <n1to> japhb: Yeah, I have the SDK set and I even set the zef as package manager manually in the project settings. I had Color set in the META6.json. Then I noticed that Color showed up under external libraries, but didn't seem to find anything that Color provides.

[05:09:01] <guifa_> [Coke]: you're a Numberphile fan I take it hahaha
[05:11:12] <japhb> n1to: I tried adding Color to my current project as a dependency, and at first I thought there was a problem, but then I heard the fans spin up on my laptop, which happens whenever Comma is indexing something new.  After the fans calmed down, I was able to `use Color::Conversion;` in one of the modules and then tab-complete some of the conversion routines.
[05:12:44] <japhb> Note: I did the META6 update via File > Project Structure > Project Settings > Modules > Dependencies, dunno if that makes a difference to when the indexing happens.
[05:15:36] <n1to> japhb: I did that too, but for me nothing happens. However it doesn't show me Color in the dropdown when I put in the module name. Just other modules like Color::Names and such. Maybe there is already something wrong.
[05:16:07] *** Quits: zacts (~zacts@user/zacts) (Quit: Client closed)
[05:24:28] <n1to> However, even for the given modules the import doesn't work and no indexing happens. Nonetheless thank you for your help. I have to go for now, but I will try again tommorrow. Maybe just trying to set everything up from the beginning.
[05:27:07] <japhb> n1to: Note that I had to override the Color::Named selection, and force just Color.
[05:27:56] <japhb> I've got a bug report open with something hinky about namespace completion, so we'll see if that rings a bell.
[05:28:28] <japhb> (Full disclosure: I *just* joined the Comma team part-time, so I'm still in the learning phase.)
[05:31:54] <perryprog> guifa_ ha nice catc
[05:31:55] <perryprog> catch*
[05:32:28] <n1to> I just invalidated the cache and now my fans get going too. Maybe he finds it now. He did ask me for Color::Names, but not for Color so far.
[05:34:28] <n1to> I am just beginning to learn raku, so nothing to worry about. You have been already really helpful. But really have to go now.
[05:35:14] <japhb> Good luck!

[16:55:59] <n1to> japhb: I managed to get the Color import to kinda work. I had to remove Color with zef in the terminal and then restart the Comma IDE. Afterwards Comma detected the missing dependency and I let it install it. I can now run and test the project and get autocompletion. The `use` statements however are still marked as errors and the message that it can't find the module. The section under External Libraries is also not correctly populated.
