[13:06:39] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> how about telescope?
[14:50:06] <SpaceVimBot_> <Shougo> Telescope is only for neovim
[15:07:17] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> What about the bug in spacevim? Spacevim does not allow python Devs to use the input() function
[15:25:40] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> I do not use telescope, do you mean it does not support vim8? (re @SpaceVimBot: Shougo: Telescope is only for neovim)
[15:26:20] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> hmm, I do not know. maybe it is feature. (re @Macurrent: What about the bug in spacevim? Spacevim does not allow python Devs to use the input() function)
[15:27:05] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> How is that a feature? (re @wsdjeg: hmm, I do not know. maybe it is feature.)
[15:27:32] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> How can that be a feature? (edited) (re @wsdjeg: hmm, I do not know. maybe it is feature.)
[15:27:43] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> please read https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/27397/cant-use-python-inputs-in-vim
[15:45:11] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> I have tried that but still it's not working (re @wsdjeg: please read https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/27397/cant-use-python-inputs-in-vim)
[15:52:01] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Here it is : http://img.vim-china.org/download/1cc48947/file_7433.jpg
[15:53:50] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Here it is. As you can see, my file is executable and i have also defined the python path at line number one. : http://img.vim-china.org/download/1cc48947/file_7433.jpg
[16:46:28] *** Quits: Haudegen (~quassel@178.115.237.87.static.drei.at) (Quit: Bin weg.)
[16:54:27] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> hmm, I do not know why it doesn not work.
[16:54:36] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> why do not use spacevim code runner?
[16:54:59] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> the key binding is SPC l r, and you can use i in code runner buffer to insert text.
[17:29:53] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> That doesn't work too, it's the one I always use (re @wsdjeg: the key binding is SPC l r, and you can use i in code runner buffer to insert text.)
[17:30:28] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Am I the only one with this problem? (re @Macurrent: )
[17:32:28] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> http://img.vim-china.org/download/3758a382/file_7434.jpg
[17:32:34] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> It works well for me
[17:33:15] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> I use call SpaceVim#plugins#runner#open('python %s')
[17:42:03] <SpaceVimBot_> <HAUKA HOLIC> Hey there \o/ IIRC in earlier versions of spacevim it was possible to autocomplete across buffers, but for now I can’t anything in the docs about that. Maybe that’s not related to spacevim but to vim/neovim, but I’m not sure at all. Does anyone has a hint?
[17:49:16] <SpaceVimBot_> <Shougo> Telescope does not work in Vim.
[17:49:36] <SpaceVimBot_> <Shougo> ddu.vim works in both Vim and neovim
[17:51:32] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> hi HAUKA HOLIC, yeah, deoplete should be able to complete words across buffers.
[17:53:11] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> Hi everyone, I am working on a new plugin(autosave), It should be able to save your changes automatically. any feedback is welcome before it is merged. https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/pull/4582
[18:02:21] <SpaceVimBot_> <HAUKA HOLIC> Ahh I thought I had `deoplete` in place, but `SPDebugInfo` showed that there is also an `autocomplete_method` option directly in the global options. I just configured the autocomplete layer and thought that was good to go
[18:31:14] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> What is this? (re @wsdjeg: I use call SpaceVim#plugins#runner#open('python %s'))
[18:32:00] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> I have never added any plugin on spacevim
[18:32:31] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> This is spacevim's built-in plugin code runner
[18:33:10] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> How do I enable it?
[18:33:31] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> It is enabled by default, you can run this command
[18:33:46] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> I always run my scripts with space + l +r
[18:33:47] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> this command (re @wsdjeg: I use call SpaceVim#plugins#runner#open('python %s'))
[18:34:51] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> SPC l r is to run default runner, the default runner of python is definded in lang#python layer, and this runner use stdin by default, so you can not use input funtion.
[18:35:15] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> this is same as cat test.py | python in command line
[18:35:32] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> this is useful for running unsaved python buffer.
[18:38:19] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> This is what i get after running that command though : http://img.vim-china.org/download/1eabb487/file_7435.jpg
[18:38:45] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> you need to use input("test\n")
[18:39:18] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> this is feature of job channel
[18:39:41] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Use it where? (re @wsdjeg: you need to use input("test\n"))
[18:40:01] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> in your python code, you need to add \n after string
[18:41:48] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Thanks, though it's forcing me to use \n (re @wsdjeg: in your python code, you need to add \n after string)
[18:42:18] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Is there any shortcut i would use for that, like the way we use space + l +r?
[18:42:21] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Is there any shortcut i would use for that, like the way we use space + l +r ? (edited)
[18:42:40] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Is there any shortcut i would use for that, like the way we use space + l +r ? (edited)
[18:42:50] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> yeah, because vim/neovim's job stdout can not get the unflushed buffer.
[18:43:40] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> same issue @Macurrent https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/issues/4194
[18:44:28] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> it is not implemented now, but if you want to use this feature, you can use custom tasts, or mapping new key binding in bootstrap function.
[18:45:20] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> also same as https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/issues/4128
[18:47:15] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Thanks man
[18:47:44] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> And is it only me, i'ts like i find space vim to be slow on low end devices.
[18:47:54] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> And is it only me, i'ts like i find space vim to be slow on low end laptops (edited)
[18:49:21] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> https://support.hp.com/za-en/document/c03924028
[18:49:22] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Here is my laptop
[18:56:00] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> I am using AMD Ryzen 7 5800H with Radeon Graphics            3.20 GHz
[18:56:31] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> .lenovo
[19:03:52] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Do you find spacevim to be slow in anyway? (re @wsdjeg: I am using AMD Ryzen 7 5800H with Radeon Graphics            3.20 GHz)
[19:06:13] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> By the way, i have a problem, our messages are stored in gitter and even if we delete them here in telegram, they still show up in gitter lol
[19:06:28] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> no, every thing works well.
[19:07:28] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> yeah, telegram is bridged with other channel see spacevim.org/community
[19:08:37] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/pull/4582
[19:08:53] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> this PR will be merged soon.
[19:09:03] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> any feedback is welcome!
[19:11:11] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> The gitter doesn't show pictures though
[19:11:53] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> I do not think so,  gitter support markdown, so you can use pictures
[19:12:52] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/586c6a98d73408ce4f410f71/8uzB/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/586c6a98d73408ce4f410f71/8uzB/image.png)
[19:12:59] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> for example:
[19:13:35] <SpaceVimBot_> <christofsteel:k-fortytwo.de> Interesting, that doesn't show up on matrix
[19:13:46] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> That picture does not show on telegram though. Same as telegram not showing pictures on gitter
[19:14:20] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> That picture does not show on telegram though. Same as gitter not showing tg pictures (edited)
[19:14:23] <SpaceVimBot_> <christofsteel:k-fortytwo.de> What about pictures from matrix?
[19:14:25] <SpaceVimBot_> <christofsteel:k-fortytwo.de> [image.png](https://gitter.ems.host/_matrix/media/v1/download/k-fortytwo.de/PMFPuMQElnvlCuVcrWVPAGYO)
[19:14:40] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Not showing too
[19:15:42] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Sorry, i have to click on that image.png for it to show the image
[19:15:43] <SpaceVimBot_> <christofsteel:k-fortytwo.de> @wsdjeg: what bridge are you using? The `mautrix-telegram` bridge should translate images (and even users)
[19:16:09] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Sorry, i have to click on that image.png link for it to show the image (edited)
[19:17:19] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg:matrix.org> hi
[19:17:36] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg:matrix.org> I am here now, we are using matterbridge
[19:18:50] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg:matrix.org> I do not have match time to set the bridge, I think matterbridge works well now, we need to support discord slack and irc
[19:21:33] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Gitter i can see supports editing, am wondering why it does not support deleting. Eg, if i edit message here in telegram, that also reflects on gitter, but if i delete message, the message is not deleted
[19:22:00] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Gitter i can see supports editing, am wondering why it does not support deleting. Eg, if i edit message here in telegram, that also reflects on gitter, but if i delete message here in telegram, the message is not deleted (edited)
[19:22:43] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg:matrix.org> irc also not support these feature.
[19:23:17] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> You mean editing and deleting?
[19:24:05] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg:matrix.org> What kind of chat software do you use most
[19:24:22] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg:matrix.org> telegram or element or gitter?
[19:25:41] <SpaceVimBot_> <christofsteel:k-fortytwo.de> Speaking only for myself: Element/Matrix
[19:26:51] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg:matrix.org> for me, it is gitter.
[19:28:00] <SpaceVimBot_> <christofsteel:k-fortytwo.de> IIRC, Gitter and Matrix should be the same (https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix)
[19:29:02] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Telegram (re @SpaceVimBot: wsdjeg:matrix.org: What kind of chat software do you use most)
[19:29:26] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> I use Telegram (edited) (re @SpaceVimBot: wsdjeg:matrix.org: What kind of chat software do you use most)
[19:29:51] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> @christofsteel:k-fortytwo.de yeah, but the defaut irc channel name is too long
[19:29:58] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> we bridged to #spacevim
[19:31:08] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> the reason for me to use gitter is that, we can use gitter js script in our website.
[19:31:30] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> I do not know if matrix support this feature.
[19:44:02] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> I did a Google search and a search history of this group appeared in Google lol (re @SpaceVimBot: wsdjeg: the reason for me to use gitter is that, we can use gitter js script in our website.)
[19:44:39] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> I did a Google search and a search history of this group appeared in Google lol. Was that the reason (edited) (re @SpaceVimBot: wsdjeg: the reason for me to use gitter is that, we can use gitter js script in our website.)
[19:54:24] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg:matrix.org> no, you I mean we can use chatting room on spacevim.org website.
[19:54:42] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg:matrix.org> without open new page.
[19:55:49] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/586c6a98d73408ce4f410f71/QeR8/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/586c6a98d73408ce4f410f71/QeR8/image.png)
[19:56:58] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Sure, I have seen it (re @SpaceVimBot: wsdjeg:matrix.org: no, you I mean we can use chatting room on spacevim.org website.)
