[02:00:56] <Jong> The failure to make philosophy a mandatory subject is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions of people. Consider the logic species X is inferior to species Y. Therefore species Y should kill species X.  Wasn't that the thinking of the race wars?  But where does the entailment of inferiority requires death come from? out of thin air, yet most people don't see that.   Had philosophy been taught in school, the logic wouldn't have gained
[02:00:56] <Jong>  popularity. Wars and genocide wouldn't have happened.

[02:17:02] <causative_> Jong, but which philosophy? Nietzsche, or perhaps Heidegger, might fully endorse species Y killing species X
[02:18:45] <Jong> causative_  You just equivocated on the term "philosophy" by using it in sense different from which I did. I used philosophy to mean the activity of philosophizing. You used the word philosophy to mean someone's ontology.
[02:19:47] <Jong> I don't think there aren different competing philosophies when it comes to deductive reasoning.

[02:20:18] <Jong> Denying the antecedent.  Affirming the consequence. I think everyone agrees that those are fallacies.
[02:21:38] <causative_> they are formal fallacies, but affirming the consequent is arguably how induction works
[02:22:22] <causative_> we observe effect B, and understand that if condition A were true we would see B, and thus we judge that A is more likely. This has the form:  B, A->B, thus probably A

[02:29:47] <Jong> causative_ how induction works depends on who is working the induction.  Machine learning is induction based. If I train on 30 birds and give the model a new image of a bird, the model returns a probability its a bird.   The model's output reflects the reasoning "I don't know if all birds have feature X, but given that's a common feature I've seen in my test set, I'll say it's probably a bird".    The word "probably" is what makes the induction correct.
[02:29:47] <Jong>    If the claim was to know for certain that a generalization is true, that would be a mistake.  Point is, induction can be done correctly or sloppily

[16:38:54] <haiferwd_> i was reading
[16:38:56] <haiferwd_> camus
[16:38:59] <haiferwd_> the other day
[16:39:04] <haiferwd_> ITS SO DIFFICLT
[16:39:46] <assan> okay

[16:39:58] <haiferwd_> albert
[16:40:00] <haiferwd_> camus
[16:40:12] <haiferwd_> the
[16:40:15] <assan> what's his contention
[16:40:18] <haiferwd_> philosopher
[16:40:21] <haiferwd_> oh
[16:40:32] <haiferwd_> um the myth of sisyphus
[16:40:36] <haiferwd_> like
[16:40:43] <haiferwd_> why u shouldn'y commit suicide
[16:40:52] <haiferwd_> but
[16:40:53] <haiferwd_> hes
[16:40:55] <haiferwd_> hard too read
[16:41:20] <assan> why does he think we shouldn't commit suicide?
[16:41:39] <haiferwd_> thats why im complaining
[16:41:42] <haiferwd_>  I CANT
[16:41:45] <haiferwd_> UNDERSTAND HIm
[16:41:51] <haiferwd_> his words are so fancy

[16:41:55] <haiferwd_> stuff
[16:42:08] <assan> okay then he's a bad teacher
[16:42:37] <haiferwd_> i dont know why all the philosophers have to talk
[16:42:37] <haiferwd_> in
[16:42:46] <haiferwd_> super duper complicated words
[16:43:08] <assan> yeah you mean european philosophers yeah?
[16:43:42] <assan> because the wise men of india and asia were quite simple

[20:49:37] <Irishmanluke> After being introduced to libertarian ideas in college my feeling about the idea of constraining the power of the state vs constraining the power of corporations became colored by three sentiments about what the left gets wrong. 1 that they drastically overestimate the power of corporations vs the power of the state, 2 that they overestimate the degree to which a democratic state can be made to
[20:49:43] <Irishmanluke> conform to the will of the people compared to corporations and 3 that the type of power the state wields, namely coercive power, ought to be viewed as a necessary evil and used extra judiciously, only when deemed absolutely necessary.
[20:49:47] <Irishmanluke> I still believe these things but I think I've softened my view at least on 1 and 3.  In the case of 1 I think about the deplatforming of Alex Jones by a small group of social media companies and payment processors.  Regardless of what you think about Alex Jones I think what this event has shown is that it's possible for a small number of private companies to remove someone from their audience.
[20:49:53] <Irishmanluke> This is not a case of someone simply losing in the marketplace of ideas because there are people that still want to hear from him but they are physically unable to.  This was also a scenario in which the decision to deplatform him was made with no transparency or outside accountability.  Who are these people and what principles do they apply to determine who should and shouldn't be allowed to
[20:49:59] <Irishmanluke> have a platform?  In this case it may seem like they made a reasonable decision but how do we know that will always be the case when they have this level of power? How do we know they haven't already deplatformed people who simply went against their collective business interests?
[20:50:04] <Irishmanluke> Now surely it's better to find yourself in this situation in the United States than in North Korea or even China, Cuba or Russia where you might end up jailed or disappeared instead of simply losing your platform.  But from the perspective of the principle of free speech, which is important principally because it grants our society the ability to form conclusions based on open debate, should
[20:50:10] <Irishmanluke> that make us feel significantly better about the situation?  When a small group of private companies can decide who has a platform and who doesn't with no transparency or accountability what does that say about our ability as a society to have open debate?  Is the fact that the censorship is coming from private companies instead of from the state change the reality about its effects?
[20:50:42] <Irishmanluke> oh jeez sorry I didnt realize how much text that was, next time Ill pastebin it
