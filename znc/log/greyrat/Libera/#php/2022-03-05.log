[00:06:45] <goddard> ya i had to upgrade to 32 on my laptop.  16 wasn't enough when running two browsers and then an IDE and potentially another IDE at the same time
[00:06:47] <da_wunder> before that 16GB and next will have 64GB, I'm just waiting that component prices get sane level
[00:07:11] <__adrian> pleb
[00:08:44] <da_wunder> personally I run windows, with chore, firefox, brave (total like ~100+ tabs), virtualbox (where I run my phpstorm), and in that vb machine I have like ~3-6 phpstorm open and I run docker containers inside that vb machine and still memory usage is like ~84%

[00:09:44] <Trancer> wsl2 + vscode .. low footprint, everything works swell

[00:11:38] <da_wunder> it's still sad that wsl2 has some issues with docker IO speed
[00:12:00] <Trancer> I think the recommendation is now to run on the WSL local fs to avoid the IO problems
[00:12:20] <da_wunder> imho - it's just weird that if I run virtualbox linux where I run those docker containers, there isn't speed problems at all :D
[00:12:22] <__adrian> Trancer: you haven't tried it in a while then have you
[00:12:42] <Trancer> __adrian: what? Linux? nah, happy with my set up, no need to change

[00:12:58] <__adrian> sure, you don't have to
[00:13:09] <da_wunder> Trancer: one thing that make it a bit faster is that you use your files on that wsl2 machine and not in your windows drive - but still that performance is not the same
[00:13:15] <__adrian> good to be aware that things change though  :)
[00:14:05] <Trancer> da_wunder: still going through the virt layer and problably not as optimized :/
[00:14:40] <da_wunder> Trancer: might be - but just using windows + virtualbox - doesn't have that issue
[00:15:22] <da_wunder> and with that I'm going through _two_ virtual layers...

[02:02:58] <da_wunder> that looks like syntax error in your script - not related to xdebug
[02:03:27] <da_wunder> and looks like you're using windows - I haven't used windows for php dev like ~20+ years
[02:03:56] <da_wunder> just because - are you really using windows in your production site, to run your php application
[02:04:27] <shailangsa> production site is on a vps/linux though
[02:04:42] *** Joins: fstd (~fstd@xdsl-78-34-125-135.nc.de)
[02:04:55] <shailangsa> is it normal for syntax errors to cause connection errors with xdebug https://prnt.sc/c2XlYs_PhrPP ?
[02:05:42] <da_wunder> if your script fails - xdebug cannot do anything for that - so most likely it'll fail
[02:07:53] <da_wunder> + you really should validate your xdebug setup with phpstorm - as does phpstorm suggests you to do
[02:08:34] <shailangsa> phpstorm recognizes xdebug it seems the syntax error was getting in way and xdebug is configured correctly though
[02:08:57] <shailangsa> as the debugger works on other files
[02:09:19] <da_wunder> so just fix that error in your script
[02:11:09] <shailangsa> if there are no errors is the debugger meant to show anything at all?
[02:11:18] <da_wunder> we don't see your code that is failing, so it's quite hard to give you detailed information

[02:11:54] <da_wunder> if you don't have any breakpoints it won't show anything
[02:12:44] <da_wunder> and we don't know if your phpstorm is really listening those php debug connections
[02:13:18] <TML> da_wunder: I'm a bit baffled how you use xdebug if you don't load the extension
[02:14:03] <TML> that's some black magic I'd like to understand :)
[02:15:10] <da_wunder> TML: as I said - that configuration is the custom configuration that I use in my dev environment - to install xdebug I use docker based commands - and that is making the "default" configuration, eg. load that extension and so on
[02:15:42] <shailangsa> it seems its catching the breakpoint hence xdebug is working fine though https://prnt.sc/uQn5nbv-iF0c
[02:16:37] <da_wunder> that looks like it's working as expected - now just fix your script that is failing
[02:16:53] <da_wunder> your IDE should help there a lot, error seems to be quite clear
[02:17:39] <TML> da_wunder: I see - so you ARE using zend_extension=xdebug.so, just that you don't account for it because it's part of your Docker image
[02:18:18] <da_wunder> eg. if you're using something like `$foo = [];` that would be an error if you're using PHP 5.3 or lower
[02:18:42] <da_wunder> TML: exactly
[02:19:26] <da_wunder> TML: I'm only interested my _own_ php.ini setup - not what there is already by default
[02:19:49] <TML> da_wunder: Whereas what's
[02:20:03] <TML> "there by default" in YOUR docker images probably isn't in anyone else's
[02:20:56] <da_wunder> might be, usually those defaults are what all distros are using by default
[02:21:36] <da_wunder> I only shared the part that _I_ changed - nothing else
[02:21:54] <TML> I don't know of any distro that ships xdebug by default, but *shrug*
[02:22:21] <da_wunder> after you install that - it will make default setup to your php.ini
[02:25:16] <da_wunder> or, at least show you how to enable that
[02:25:42] <da_wunder> imho - with docker all this is just so much simpler
[02:26:05] <da_wunder> specially if you need to use different php versions and extensions between applications
[02:26:35] <da_wunder> + with docker you could literally build 1:1 setup to match your production environment
[02:28:46] <TML> I'm not disagreeing with you there - all of my PHP sites are in docker containers for quite a while now. I was just baffled when you told shailangsa that you're using xdebug without loading the extension :)
[02:29:35] <da_wunder> oh, maybe I should be a bit clearer with that gist, this is only the custom part that I'm changing

[02:37:31] <TML> shailangsa: If the PHP runtime can't even execute your script, the engine bails out before XDebug has a chance to do anything meaningful. Some people use "php -l <scriptname.php>" as a way of detecting some of the common propblems that might choke your script before XDebug starts.
[02:37:40] <TML> propblems?
[02:37:43] <TML> :sigh:
[02:41:02] <shailangsa> it seems php -l does the same thing as run on the IDE though
[02:41:41] <TML> I have no idea about that, never used an IDE for PHP. I just know "php -l" will show syntax errors.
[02:41:54] <da_wunder> so share your script so we could take a look what is the error there
[02:43:23] <da_wunder> and also tell us which PHP version you're using, because that error looks like you're using short syntax array and that was instroduced in php 5.4 - so if you're using lower php version that is expected error - as I earlier mentioned
[02:48:20] <shailangsa> that error is resolved now but would've thought that the IDE could help autocomplete field names though https://prnt.sc/ar5KLYDh-EVg it seems it cant, at least it shows the value it retrieves from the database like at the end of line 16
[02:49:52] <da_wunder> IDE cannot know your array shape if you don't tell it what it is
[02:50:09] <da_wunder> use objects to get autocomplete features
[02:50:37] <da_wunder> or phpstan/psalm plugins and then use array shape annotation
[02:50:58] <shailangsa> it's using mysqli_fetch_array though
[02:51:30] <da_wunder> but again you're doing `SELECT * FROM ...` your IDE doesn't know what there is - that is the problem
[02:51:48] <TML> shailangsa: Your IDE isn't going to normally connect to the database and query the table to see the column names
[02:52:07] <da_wunder> it just knows that it's an array - nothing else

[05:24:49] <Peppi^> so I have this code that I'm using in Snippets in wordpress. Originally lines 1-9 was in my functions.php file and 13-39 were in /js/custom.js
[05:25:31] <Blondie101010> and now you decided to make it worse by mixing the languages?
[05:25:40] <Peppi^> my question is I need to change line 5 to basically call lines 13-39 how would I do this?
[05:26:41] <Blondie101010> if your intention is to pass that to the wp_enqueue_script() for whatever reason, put it inside a variable or constant
[05:27:45] <Peppi^> one second
[05:28:00] <__adrian> Peppi^: to clarify, you cannot "mix" the two languages or use them "together"
[05:28:15] <__adrian> what you can do, is make a php function that returns text (js code).
[05:29:47] <__adrian> or looks like wp_enqueue_script() expects a filename, so just put your js in a file (this is sensible) and pass the filename.
[05:29:49] <Peppi^> __adrian, is not line 4 reading / loading the custom.js file?
[05:30:35] <Blondie101010> definitely not, though not knowing WP, I don't know what is done with it precisely
[05:30:38] <__adrian> i don't know. it mihgt be "loading" the file contents, but it's just text - it's not running js code/functions.
[05:30:55] <Peppi^> __adrian, yes correct
[05:31:00] <__adrian> for the wordpress-specific questions, you should ask on #wordpress
