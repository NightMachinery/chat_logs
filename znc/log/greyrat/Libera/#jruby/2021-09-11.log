[01:55:29] <headius> Gonna have to spend some serious time after release improving arm64 and M1 stuff
[02:03:27] <byteit101[m]> headius: I made two comments on the PR
[02:03:36] <headius> Ok thanks
[02:04:31] <headius> Hmm I don't see them
[02:19:29] <byteit101[m]> Ah! I had to click comment
[02:19:44] <headius> Aha!
[02:20:09] <byteit101[m]> would also explain why everything was all yellow
[02:20:30] <headius> Agreed on both
[02:20:59] <headius> I am sometimes afraid to add more tests because I might find something broken ðŸ˜€
[02:21:23] <byteit101[m]> :-D
[02:21:23] <headius> No test, no user, no bug!
[02:21:37] <headius> ðŸ™ˆðŸ™‰ðŸ™Š

[02:57:36] <headius> I hope that's enough!
[02:58:07] <headius> amazingly I made only one typo in that whole thing
[02:58:09] <headius> ðŸ’ª
[03:00:03] <byteit101[m]> Nice
