[01:58:01] <rdrg109> [Q] Why does delete-panel-buffer prompts for a buffer? Isn't it a fact that there will always be at most one available panel buffer or am I missing something?
[01:58:35] <waleee> aha. It sounds like some tuning regarding CL_SOURCE_REGISTRY is needed somewhere
[01:59:05] <waleee> rdrg109: you can create your own panel-buffers
[02:01:09] <waleee> uniquepointer: are you having source "$out/lib/common-lisp-settings" commented out?
[02:01:32] <uniquepointer> not initially

[02:19:42] <uniquepointer> now that build system would make me happy
[02:20:01] <waleee> uniquepointer: you can already use guile in (gnu) make
[02:20:11] <uniquepointer> yes but gnu make is poo poo
[02:20:13] <uniquepointer> i mean i love make

[02:51:41] <waleee> uniquepointer: as far as I can tell that source and some other stuff needs define-package.nix to work (more specifically deployConfigScript) which looks annoying to use without the rest of the package builder
[02:52:59] <waleee> Had you tried a build with NYXT_SUBMODULES=true ?
[02:53:18] <uniquepointer> those compile
[02:53:48] <waleee> was it those builds that didn't run afterwards?
[02:53:58] <uniquepointer> yep
[02:54:07] <uniquepointer> but i dont think it has to do with the submodules
[02:54:14] <uniquepointer> the error is sbcl.core cant be found
[02:56:13] <waleee> looks like the LD_LIBRARY_PATH might needs some additional padding, https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/9679be6d87626ecf0ae4ea509197e66948b2759f/pkgs/development/lisp-modules/define-package.nix#L48

[02:57:11] <uniquepointer> i have 2 exams back to back so i cant do it rn
[02:57:16] <uniquepointer> if not ill do it after
[02:57:57] <waleee> sure, I can try some more stuff

[03:02:34] <uniquepointer> vectors and shit, but im rusty, i havent done any physics in 5 years
[03:02:46] <uniquepointer> like i have been good so far but this one he gave me was a doozy
[03:03:11] <waleee> so either mechanics (dynamics) or electro-magnetism?
[03:03:24] <uniquepointer> imma just tell it to you because its dummy stupid

[03:06:15] <uniquepointer> dont have tod o it for me, just how2do it

[03:09:54] <uniquepointer> but this is the image he used LMAO
[03:10:29] <uniquepointer> so its just sqrt a^2 * b^2?
[03:11:35] <waleee> those will probably not form a "right triangle"

[03:16:13] <waleee> uniquepointer: go down to "Application to the law of cosines" on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product
[03:16:34] <uniquepointer> yeah thats what i was JUST typing, he tips you off so i read on it and landed on it
[03:16:45] <uniquepointer> but knowing it in english is important for me so thank you
[03:17:48] <uniquepointer> tyty only 2 problems to go
[03:28:32] <waleee> when you're done you could try uncommenting pkgs.sbcl from nativeBuildInputs, apparently compilers is in some cases needed in both nativeBuildInputs and buildInputs (python was apparently one case)
[03:30:00] <uniquepointer> oh i commented it in favour of the common-lisp.sh
[03:30:07] <uniquepointer> but ya i can do that
[03:30:37] <waleee> I'm not sure that script does anything since you don't use buildLispPackage
[03:30:49] <waleee> * not even if it exists at that point
[03:34:55] <waleee> uniquepointer: this is another commonlisp program https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/a0dbe47318bbab7559ffbfa7c4872a517833409f/pkgs/development/tools/pgloader/default.nix

[08:09:09] <uniquepointer> what cleitn do you use?
[08:09:14] <uniquepointer> client*
[08:09:23] <jmercouris> I use Circe
[08:09:31] <jmercouris> On my phone I use IRCCloud client
[08:09:34] <jmercouris> I’m on my phone
[08:09:42] <uniquepointer> ah an emacs client
[08:09:42] <jmercouris> I also use konversation sometimes
[08:09:47] <uniquepointer> ic
[08:09:53] <jmercouris> I have irc and email in eMacs
[08:10:07] <jmercouris> But I plan to put them into Nyxt so I won’t have to use eMacs other than for coding
[08:10:11] <uniquepointer> i used to use weechat but then i was like meh i cba to remember the terminal commands so i installed hex chat
[08:10:24] <uniquepointer> i do everything on the terminal but irc
[08:10:28] <jmercouris> For terminal I like irssi
[08:10:47] <jmercouris> And for terminal email I like alpine
[08:10:50] <uniquepointer> i never tried it
[08:10:54] <uniquepointer> alpine
[08:10:57] <uniquepointer> that sounds familiar
[08:10:59] <jmercouris> Your life is not ruined
[08:11:02] <uniquepointer> i think kernighan mentioned it life
[08:11:05] <jmercouris> It won’t change anything
[08:11:16] <uniquepointer> i tried aerc on the terminal but it didnt work :>(
[08:11:20] <jmercouris> Pine is an old client alpine is based off
[08:11:22] <uniquepointer> it worked last time
[08:11:34] <jmercouris> You can use eMacs clients as well you know
[08:11:41] <jmercouris> eMacs runs just fine in the terminal
[08:11:45] <uniquepointer> im sorry girl but im not going back to emacs
[08:11:53] <jmercouris> Lol
[08:12:07] <uniquepointer> yeah but also you get crucified for not using gtk and also emacs is too neat on gtk
[08:12:19] <jmercouris> Too neat?
[08:12:24] <uniquepointer> too good
[08:12:26] <uniquepointer> too great
[08:12:27] <jmercouris> You like things messy?

[08:12:45] <jmercouris> Lol yes
[08:12:49] <jmercouris> It’s slow
[08:12:49] <uniquepointer> (craps out because i use pgtkgcc)
[08:12:58] <jmercouris> But I also have a Xeon computer
[08:13:03] <jmercouris> So it’s not too bad for me
[08:13:03] <uniquepointer> me too :D
[08:13:12] <uniquepointer> but i dont have a latest xeon
[08:13:23] <jmercouris> Are you also in the thinkpad crew?

[08:13:51] <uniquepointer> no but i wish i was
[08:13:56] <jmercouris> Oh
[08:13:57] <uniquepointer> i have a macbook pro with openbsd on it too
[08:14:03] <jmercouris> Oh I see
[08:14:11] <jmercouris> I just sold my MacBook
[08:14:17] <jmercouris> A couple days ago
[08:14:18] <uniquepointer> macbooks suck
[08:14:21] <jmercouris> I had a 2016
[08:14:29] <uniquepointer> but the new ones are neat and i wish they could run linux
[08:14:32] <uniquepointer> but i cant afford one
[08:14:35] <uniquepointer> i ahve an early 2015
[08:14:36] <jmercouris> I see
[08:14:42] <jmercouris> Panama currency and all that
[08:14:43] <uniquepointer> its slow as shit!
[08:14:48] <uniquepointer> sure lmao
[08:14:52] <jmercouris> Put an SSD in it
[08:14:58] <uniquepointer> it has an ssd!
[08:15:03] <jmercouris> Hm
[08:15:07] <jmercouris> I don’t know then
[08:15:25] <jmercouris> What’s the currency in Panama
[08:15:31] <jmercouris> Pesos?
[08:15:31] <uniquepointer> i barely use it now that i got a desktop again its cool
[08:15:33] <uniquepointer> balboas
[08:15:40] <jmercouris> Balboa???
[08:15:42] <uniquepointer> yeah but
[08:15:46] <uniquepointer> in actuality
[08:15:49] <uniquepointer> we use american dollars
[08:15:54] <uniquepointer> lol
[08:16:02] <jmercouris> I see
[08:16:12] <jmercouris> Wow that’s the real name of the currency
[08:16:15] <uniquepointer> but thats actually a horrible idea because people see that and think the avergae citizen can afford stuff at the american price
[08:16:33] <jmercouris> So like what is a typical salary
[08:16:43] <jmercouris> Could someone afford a 500$ computer?
[08:16:51] <uniquepointer> hm
[08:16:59] <uniquepointer> yea but
[08:17:06] <uniquepointer> they expect it to last for at least 5 years no problem
[08:17:10] <jmercouris> Lol
[08:17:11] <uniquepointer> and computers are the worst!
[08:17:19] <jmercouris> Well
[08:17:29] <jmercouris> I used to run only a tty
[08:17:42] <jmercouris> And for that a 15 year old computer will easily suffice
[08:17:51] <jmercouris> Obviously it won’t let me develop Nyxt though
[08:18:10] <uniquepointer> the problem is people use their computers to play games or watch youtube
[08:18:15] <jmercouris> Yes
[08:18:18] <uniquepointer> both of which run on unoptimized code
[08:18:19] <uniquepointer> lmao
[08:18:23] <jmercouris> Indeed
[08:18:28] <jmercouris> Because YouTube doesn’t care
[08:18:36] <jmercouris> I swear that website is so badly programmed
[08:18:39] <jmercouris> So inefficient
[08:18:48] <uniquepointer> i havent opened it in months now
[08:18:51] <uniquepointer> only on one of my phones
[08:18:54] <uniquepointer> the other one has newpipe
[08:19:01] <uniquepointer> on the computer i use ytfzf, yt-dlp and mpv
[08:19:05] <jmercouris> It’s a shame that I like so many YouTube channels
[08:19:18] <jmercouris> I wish they would distribute via other means as well
[08:19:39] <jmercouris> Those are in a legally gray area
[08:19:43] <jmercouris> Hence why I do not use them
[08:19:51] <uniquepointer> o
[08:19:56] <uniquepointer> fair
[08:19:58] <uniquepointer> invidious?
[08:20:04] <jmercouris> Same
[08:20:05] <uniquepointer> just a mirror of youtube eh eh?? :d
[08:20:07] <uniquepointer> damn it
[08:20:21] <jmercouris> I think applying a style sheet to the site would be fine
[08:20:31] <jmercouris> Hiding all sorts of elements other than maybe the search bar
[08:20:34] <jmercouris> And the playing video
[08:20:44] <jmercouris> That would do a lot to making YouTube much more performant
[08:20:45] <aartaka> jmercouris: I'm preparing for a presentation for one of the courses, ahah. It's not that early for me, though — it's 10 AM in where I am :)

[21:16:15] <uniquepointer> hendursaga, the yt-dlp devs?
[21:16:30] <uniquepointer> :( hope we dont go down a youtube-dl route
[21:21:53] <waleee> what has occured?
[21:23:07] <waleee> uniquepointer: looked at the current version of default.nix, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to be populated before you add it to wrapProgram
[21:24:29] <uniquepointer> but it is being populated
[21:24:32] <uniquepointer> (i think?)
[21:24:34] <uniquepointer> line 88
[21:25:09] <hendursaga> uniquepointer: no, the youtube-dl ones went AWOL
[21:26:31] <waleee> there was someone that claimed that the main dev (which looks like the only one that had write privileges) was moving and had started a new job
[21:26:36] <waleee> (in an issue)
[21:27:54] <waleee> uniquepointer: oops, I checked the commit where you added wrapProgram
[21:28:07] <uniquepointer> hahaha npnp
[21:29:18] <waleee> lol the issues on youtube-dl/yt-dlp is always entertaining, one of the latest ones on yt-dlp is for a xxx-site
