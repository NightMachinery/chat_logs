[00:31:07] <dbohdan[phone]> galambo: Most people never try a trackball. I tried one early, because my very first mouse was a PowerBook trackball. I doubt I would have bought a trackball for my 1990s era Windows PC. Without the PowerBook I probably wouldn't have been exposed to trackballs until I started researching ergonomics much later in life. And even then I would have been more reluctant to buy one.
[00:32:13] <galambo> dbohdan[phone], what would you tell your version in an alternate reality that never used a trackball before?
[00:32:44] <dbohdan[phone]> If trackballs were the default somewhere, we'd see more people using them at home

[00:35:22] <galambo> are trackballs more accurate than mice?

[00:36:30] <dbohdan[phone]> Then it's a matter of preference. I don't think they are more accurate. For instance, FPSs are probably easier with a mouse.

[03:17:45] <feepbot> <gwern> 'At a media conference a few weeks after Crimea’s annexation, Putin famously told reporters that the internet was a “CIA project.” He singled out Yandex for being “developed with Western influence” and suggested that its registration in the Netherlands was “not only for tax reasons but for other considerations too.”' <-- they really don't like yandex do they
[03:22:30] <kuudes> gwern, nopt only shoigu but gerasimov as well
[03:22:44] <kuudes> per doctrine, it seems putin can't operate tacnukes currently
[03:24:24] <kuudes> ukraine is getting to counteroffensive it seems, and the 15000 soldiers in that 60 km convoy appear possibly to be in motti
[03:24:39] <kuudes> but I guess this should go to #lw-politics
[03:28:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Ohh so the latex popup thing isn't a latex thing, it's a feature of "Evince" which is a PDF viewer app for GNOME
[03:28:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're "link previews"
[03:28:57] <gwern> hm. so how many PDF viewers do that?
[03:29:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Basically like our in-page anchorlink popups
[03:29:14] <gwern> evince is reasonably common on linux desktops, or to put it another way, ~0% of the world
[03:29:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> How many? Well, I've never seen any PDF viewer do this before
[03:30:10] <gwern> I don't think it's a default, because I used to use evince a ton (and may still, I'm not super sure what I use right now on MATE), so you may never have seen it before
[03:31:24] <saturn2> MATE has a forked version of evince called atril
[03:32:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: The Dream™ for academic paper handling imo is for us to find a good way to render PDFs / other LaTeX output (PS? EPS?) into HTML, and then to render it as local content, and then that can use the usual extracts architecture
[03:32:32] <gwern> mm. well, you've seen the ar5iv output, and that seems to be SOTA for compiling latex to html
[03:33:03] <gwern> compiling raw PDFs? forget about it
[03:33:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> I believe I did suggest retrieving ar5iv and rendering locally, as an external annotation source a la WP
[03:33:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Could experiment with that after some more urgent stuff is handled
[03:34:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> And yeah raw PDFs, there's nothing right now, I am aware...
[03:34:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> But perhaps someday?? One can dream...
[03:34:13] <gwern> you may've, after I found that of course they set X headers. it's a reasonable feature
[03:34:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> I wonder if
[03:34:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm
[03:35:02] <gwern> which raises the question of how many cases of failed linklive popups could be done by fetching the HTML and rendering like WP, bypassing the linklive iframe business entirely
[03:37:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Arbitrarily many, but the problem is for each case, I have to manually write custom code to sift through whatever idiosyncratic HTML structure and extract the content and reformat it
[03:38:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe there's some standardization of the code that could be done, sure, but still
[03:38:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> But I have another idea...
[03:38:30] <gwern> yeah, the readability URI is probably a better idea to explore
[03:39:14] <gwern> fetching the HTML would only work if there's a lot of pages where simply rendering <body></body>, or some equally simple universal rule, would work
[03:43:01] <gwern> (which *might* be true for ar5iv, of course, question is, how many other places would work)

[04:51:27] <adiabatic> considered, but not enough to change my mind
[04:51:45] <adiabatic> that _is_ a problem with unaccompanied tungsten balls, though
[04:53:23] <gwern> obviously, you need *two* balls. yoked together somehow, possibly with an additional tunsten rod
[04:53:44] <gwern> that would make a triangular configuration which will be extremely stable and manly
[04:53:54] <enterprisey> the issues an unaccompanied tungsten ball creates makes it needy. I prefer to be the only needy entity around

[04:55:02] <gwern> hence the need for two. it's sort of like cats or ferrets in that respect - 2 > 1

[04:58:31] <gwern> from the descriptions of precision, I don't think it'd be possible to do by hand, because you would not be able to test it from every point and verify you had removed all the stable/unstable points

[11:30:55] <feep[work]> alternately there's a technique you could try that worked for me, but it's completely unproven
[11:30:57] <synthmeat> later process it though
[11:31:11] <dbohdan[phone]> What I am doing ATM is taking a benzo. It only helps so much.
[11:31:14] <feep[work]> mh
[11:31:34] <feep[work]> um, do you think you should feel this way? like, is this a valid feeling? does it have a purpose?
[11:31:41] <feep[work]> what is it for?
[11:32:20] <dbohdan[phone]> synthmeat: I have been trying and failing to postpone the processing
[11:33:19] <synthmeat> i deal kinda destructively with it, but i'm not sure is that viable situation with every situation - i drown myself fully in it, accompanied with songs and booze. it kinda washes away after a short while.
[11:34:07] <feep[work]> the thing that worked for me is redirection, but that's cause I tend to obsession/intrusive thoughts
[11:34:20] <feep[work]> ie. find a thing that the feeling is good for instead of pushing it away
[11:34:22] <synthmeat> (multiple suicides over here, where i theoretically could've made difference)
[11:34:37] <feep[work]> which lets me integrate it, which ironically dampens it.
[11:35:39] <dbohdan[phone]> feep[work]: It has helped me realize how much learned helplessness I have accumulated. I just went with the default choices, sort of. There is that. I am even grateful for this realization, as horrible as its cause is.
[11:35:54] <feep[work]> dbohdan[phone]: that seems valuable.
[11:36:57] <dbohdan[phone]> synthmeat: I'd have a hard time dealing with suicides guilt-wise, too. I'm sorry.
[11:38:38] <dbohdan[phone]> feep[work]: I think it is. But I've reached the end of the value, I am pretty sure, and the emotions keep coming. I can't really afford them with a heart this weak.
[11:39:21] <synthmeat> enveloping yourself fully into it was pretty much cathartic, but i guess it's a risky strategy

[12:48:02] <dbohdan[phone]> Typical rationalist background (tm)
[12:51:19] <synthmeat> it's also fascinating to me how a family tree can be defined by a simple incident in a node. my grandgrandfater(m) built by himself a first electric mill (in a wide region). every since him, it's generations and generations of people gradually realizing that life isn't really easy
[12:52:59] <synthmeat> my grandgrandfather(f) was one of the first casualties between two of the opposing factions - generations and generations of vagabonds/mercenaries/soldiers
[13:07:31] <dbohdan[phone]> Let me tell you of my single most memorable interaction with my grandmother. She had recently been treated for cancer. She was going up a flight of stairs. I was standing near the bottom. Suddenly, she stopped in the middle and started to slowly turn around. (She's obese.) She looked me in the eye through her thick glasses and declared, "I have forgotten a staying. Can you tell me how it ends? 'Na bezryb'e...'" The saying 
[13:07:31] <dbohdan[phone]> was the Russian saying, "Na bezryb'e i rak ryba", literally, "When there is no fish a crab is a fish", meaning "better something than nothing at all". The Russian word for "crab" here is the same as the word for "cancer". So she wanted me to say the word "cancer". Maybe she thought it would transfer her cancer to me or give me cancer or something. I told her I had no idea and she should google it. She wasn't pleased.
[13:10:29] <dbohdan[phone]> The punchline: she is a psychiatrist. Or rather, she was. Allegedly, patients reacted badly to her, so my grandfather urged her to retrain and switch to neurology.
[13:24:20] <synthmeat> lol. that's some mad villainy there

[13:58:35] <dbohdan[phone]> synthmeat: You can satisfy those conditions by being super miserable all the time 🤔
[13:59:30] <dbohdan[phone]> rsaarelm: Would it have been easier had you chosen Clojure instead of Rust?
[14:01:28] <rsaarelm> dbohdan[phone]: I tried jumping to clojure around a year and a half ago, but ended up realizing that my format is very much targeting the same niche as Clojure's edn while not being it, and Clojure philosophy really doesn't seem like a good fit for that.
[14:02:10] <rsaarelm> The current thing is pretty much tied up with Rust's type system and serde serialization framework, though the actual format is language-agnostic.
[14:02:38] <dbohdan[phone]> Yeah, I remember you trying Clojure around then. Is EDN extensible?
[14:03:18] <rsaarelm> It might be, but that doesn't help when the core structures don't really line up.
[14:03:41] <rsaarelm> Clojure seems to have a philosophy that you should fit your problem to Clojure's structures instead of making complex translation machinery.
[14:04:16] <rsaarelm> (Also, the slow startup cost rubbed be wrong a lot with clojure, I really like the aesthetics of lightining-fast command line tools for what I'm doing)
[14:04:27] <rsaarelm> *rubbed me wrong
[14:04:38] <dbohdan[phone]> I see. Yeah, that's my impression of Clojure, too.
[14:05:16] <dbohdan[phone]> The slow startup has been partially fixed with GraalVM. See: Babashka.
[14:05:24] <rsaarelm> So far as I can tell, clojure would be fine for a server application and when your problem domain doesn't step on the clojuric data representation's toes.
[14:05:57] <rsaarelm> Yeah, I looked at GraalVM stuff, but it seemed a bit of a complex thing to rig up, compared to Rust which I'm already familiar with.
[14:06:38] <rsaarelm> I think I've hit the old person comfort zone thing where I don't really like to switch stuff around at the level of the base language anymore and have moved on from explore to exploit while stuck at Rust.
[14:07:04] <synthmeat> yeah, i think i might find my old person comfort zone in Go
[14:07:39] <rsaarelm> The stuff I'm doing right now with the serde thing is pretty wacky in how tricky it gets and it really gives me a pause how much work I'd need to do with something like Haskell to get near the same fluency.
[14:08:35] <dbohdan[phone]> rsaarelm: Do you think Rust's memory management slows down development relative to if you had GC? Do you often have to change T to Rc<RefCell<T>> and then Arc<Mutex<T>>, etc.?

[14:10:10] <dbohdan[phone]> I wonder myself. I have only used Rust so much.
[14:10:32] <rsaarelm> I often need to think a lot about how to set up stuff, but then I often also feel like I end up with pretty robust abstractions to build on top of.

[14:12:07] <rsaarelm> I feel like with old-school untyped GC languages I'd eventually get bogged down by not being able to keep the system together in my head and not having the types as safety rails, but nothing says you can't have both types and GC.

[14:13:42] <synthmeat> yeah. limited (smth with func types issues). but iirc it does leave option to cover that up properly in the future as well.
[14:14:49] <synthmeat> got a carte blanche last week to rewrite all the backend infra (node.js) to go. will see how that goes.
[14:17:59] <rsaarelm> My current sketch for the parser for my IDM format is a stack machine with four different enter operations (switching based on what sort of types are being requested), and pretty straightforward otherwise. The brain-breaking part is that the deserialization is affected by both the types being deserialized into and the structure of the input text, so the combinatorial explosion has been doing my
[14:18:01] <rsaarelm> head in.
[14:18:50] <feep[work]> D has types and GC as well
[14:19:17] <rsaarelm> Yeah, D is pretty neat.

[14:21:52] <feep[work]> tinyredis released a month ago~
[14:24:15] <synthmeat> doesn't even have any structural abstractions except Set!
[14:24:55] <feep[work]> what does
[14:24:59] <synthmeat> tinyredis
[14:25:07] <feep[work]> it has lists..
[14:26:11] <feep[work]> tho we just used the redis api near-directly
[14:26:52] <synthmeat> it works nicely even over stdin/out
[14:27:09] <feep[work]> redis ftw
[14:27:18] <feep[work]> tho tbf we're just using it as a fancy kv store
[14:27:53] <dbohdan[phone]> I found tinyredis ergonomic enough to just disappear into the background when I briefly used D. A mirror of the Redis API is what I generally want.
[14:28:00] <synthmeat> pubsub scaled just fine to pumping a gigabit at all times
[14:28:12] <synthmeat> (doesn't say much, i know)
[14:29:23] <dbohdan[phone]> A good Redis library seems barely there but in fact covers the corner cases
[14:47:14] <two2thehead> feep[work], ignore my feep message
[14:47:18] <two2thehead> I figured it out
[14:47:55] <feep[work]> okay~

[16:56:45] <kuudes> dbohdan[phone], fwiw I strongly recommend against using benzos most any time. but I guess war time could make an exception
[16:57:00] <kuudes> but tolerance builds in at most at 2 weeks
[16:57:23] <kuudes> and then they have paradoxical effects where they or withdrawal causes the same moods they were used against
[16:58:37] <kuudes> if you have used them already long before war, I guess then quitting them now is not useful, but if you are starting, I would strongly recommend on making it temporary, at most 2 weeks, unless you have some specific trigger event for their stoppage, such as running to safety
[16:58:49] <kuudes> but I am neither a doctor nor in a war zone
[16:59:33] <kuudes> my best wishes in any case. I agree your deduction that things suck is correct.
[17:06:11] <dbohdan[phone]> Thanks. I am taking smaller doses (1/4 of the standard pill). My mother took the same drug, Gidazepam, to manage her heart problems (an approved use) for many months. She tittered it off and suffered no apparent problems or major side effects.
[17:09:22] <kuudes> good
[17:10:47] <dbohdan[phone]> I would certainly not take Phenazepam or any other "heavier" benzo the same way
[17:11:55] <kuudes> I guess nonnuclear icbms could make sense if you don't have nuclear warheads.
[17:12:11] <kuudes> in any case, it most plausibly will be interpreted as a nuclear strike until hit
[17:12:55] <dbohdan[phone]> Yes. I am thinking of them as a way to have ICBMs without breaking nonproliferation agreements.

[17:17:09] <kuudes> there was anti-intermediate range ballistic missile treaty in europe, but russia withdrew from it iirc or nato withdrew from it claiming russia breach or something
[17:18:26] <kuudes> and that was related to the one loonie academic/hobbyist who liked rocket motors to relocating to iran from west because he wanted to make long range flying objects even if they were against international treaties some decade ago
[17:18:38] <dbohdan[phone]> I think Russia extended its range and in response the US withdrew under Trump

[19:55:35] <Betawolf> why would you ever let people enter your home?
[19:56:07] <kuudes> and smart people took a break from the office when norovirus started to go around there even before pandemic, because a lot of people don't actually wash their hands after pooping nor before going to the lunchery to eat.
[19:56:13] <kuudes> because I like my friends?

[19:56:40] <kuudes> depends
[19:57:00] <gwern> I doubt the buildings are going to provide this hypothetical 'better soap' which lets me wash my hands potentially dozens of times a day with no damage
[19:57:01] <kuudes> but hand washing is near trivial because we have so much water and good soap

[21:40:09] <PapuaHardyNet> disappointing
[21:40:34] <two2thehead> I'm not being clear. One problem I have with normal displays is eyestrain. Do you have any eyestrain from that display?
[21:40:57] <galambo> two2thehead, no. its like paper/kindle display
[21:40:58] <two2thehead> dTal, well they need it even more then! :V

[21:45:10] <dTal> not really true, the home screen always has ads for books
[21:45:45] <dTal> there was a time when the default interface to a kindle was just a list of the documents you had on the device - no more
[21:45:56] <dTal> now it's like looking at the front page of Amazon.com
[21:46:04] <galambo> kindle is too restrictive. I just download books on my phone from libgen
[21:46:10] <dTal> the ads you can pay to remove are *extra* ads
[21:46:13] <two2thehead> I'm surprised that that isn't more of a problem
[21:46:16] <will1> there's also options to jailbreak older ones. i've kept mine in airplane mode from day 1 and just used calibre for book organization. the lack of connectivity is a feature
[21:46:21] <dTal> additional ads on top of the standard ads
[21:46:24] <ggreer> oh you're talking about the UI, not the "show ads on the lock screen" thing
[21:46:37] <galambo> isnt there the old kindle with free 3g internet browsing worldwide?
[21:46:42] <will1> i have a voyager as my main one, and i got a paperwhite ad free on some deal day
[21:46:47] <dTal> that's right, *those* ads. The other ads. The built-in, unremovable ones.
[21:46:48] <galambo> the one with the keyboard
[21:46:53] <two2thehead> ie "Amazon has such a monopoly on ebooks so we USGOVT should force them to do thing x y and z"
[21:47:16] <ggreer> I don't think people pay for placement in those recommendations. you just see "thing I didn't buy" and think "ad"
[21:47:19] <dTal> galambo: doesn't have free 3g any more, it's been shut off
[21:47:26] <galambo> ah
[21:47:29] <two2thehead> bummer
[21:47:57] <dTal> ggreer: Amazon places them there, in the hope I buy them. They're ads. What else would you call them?
[21:48:07] <ggreer> by that logic, amazon.com is all ads
[21:48:19] <ggreer> an ad is something that someone *pays* amazon for to show you
[21:48:29] <PapuaHardyNet> ???
[21:48:31] <dTal> That's an absurdly narrow definition
[21:48:36] <two2thehead> that's... quite a narrow
[21:48:39] <two2thehead> yeah what dTal said
[21:48:55] <PapuaHardyNet> amazon sells products, and it markets it. that's an ad
[21:49:07] <dTal> amazon.com is indeed covered in ads, but at least you have to explicitly visit it
[21:49:07] <will1> some sites call some streaming services 'ad free', say hbo max, but they still do preroll uhm trailers, for only hbo max content. but does still seem like ads, just for themselves
[21:49:32] <dTal> whereas with a kindle, I am presented with products to buy even when I am trying to do something else
[21:49:57] <ggreer> ok so if I hire a plumber and the plumber shows up in a van that says "Brian's Plumbing Company", is that an ad?
[21:50:40] <two2thehead> ggreer, nitpick, Brian's Plumbing Company doesn't put a display that has his latest prices and services on a display on your sink
[21:50:46] <dTal> If you hire a plumber and they make you sit through a 10 minute schpiel about their other side businesses before they fix your sink, is that an ad?
[21:50:58] <will1> jailbreaking a kindle can remove all ads or functions you want / don't want. just check ahead of time on like the mobile read forums to make sure it can be jb'd
[21:51:05] <ggreer> you're using "ad" to mean "thing that annoys me"
[21:51:17] <two2thehead> will1 +1, TIL
[21:51:29] <PapuaHardyNet> "ad" is anything that maximizes revenue for the party providing any information
[21:51:32] <dTal> no I'm using it to mean a picture of a product placed in front of me in hopes that I will buy it
[21:51:46] <ggreer> you can complain about bad user interfaces or annoying recommendations without calling them ads
[21:51:54] <ggreer> ok so brands in general are ads?
[21:51:57] <dTal> yes, I can. They're ads though
[21:52:01] <will1> or just airplane mode i think, not sure why that's not an option for a thing that can hold hundreds of books that would take months to read
[21:52:08] <galambo> why are you guys arguing semantics?
[21:52:13] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah! not a judgement, I'm simply using a definition, yeah
[21:52:25] <dTal> galambo: more interesting than arguing syntax I guess
[21:52:29] <will1> taking a few min to plug it into a computer to sync books. then if you need instant info just pull out your phone, or use a tablet
[21:52:42] <will1> not having to charge for 2 weeks is so nice also btw
[21:52:45] <dTal> "Advertising is a marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, non-personal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea."
[21:52:52] <dTal> seems pretty straightforward
[21:53:01] <galambo> kindle is not the only eink reader in the market
[21:53:16] <dTal> pictures of books on the home screen are non personal messages to promote or sell a product
[21:53:19] <ggreer> yeah, sponsored as in "we got paid to put this in front of your face"
[21:53:53] <will1> galambo: they definitely have economies of scale. you can get a kindle for a really good price/performance
[21:54:06] <ggreer> galambo: true but that's like saying teslas aren't the only EVs on the market
[21:54:21] <galambo> will1, yes price/performance but you also get ads
[21:54:38] <galambo> its like chinese phones. they have crazy hardware for the price but you also get ads

[23:29:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes... an *extremely obvious* solution to all these dilemmas is "justice is the classical sense of 'justice', and then separately from that, we can and should care about people and try to help them and so on, while of course *also* working to improve the world in various ways such that there arise fewer situations where individual people need to be helped"
[23:29:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> (i.e., the Moldbug answer, of course)
[23:30:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is justice? It's when the laws are constructed and applied fairly and impartially
[23:30:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Does economic inequality have anything to do with this? It does not
[23:32:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> So under this view, we say "Likewise, when I play computer games, which causes my local power plant to emit a little more CO2, am I harming people on Kiribati? Yes, definitely (to some very small degree). Is it a violation of climate justice that I am allowed to play computer games? Can we at least agree that this is a tougher question?" ... no, "climate justice" does not exist, but of course it's perfectly reasonable to want
[23:32:14] <Obormot\Arcturus>  climate to be good and not bad, to want power plants to not pollute the atmosphere, to want us all to be able to play computer games without harming the environment, etc.
[23:32:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> All perfectly reasonable, let's make it happen!
[23:32:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> But what has it to do with justice? Nothing, the end

[23:43:48] <dbohdan[phone]> gwern: Fair enough. I guess with sufficient compute you could simulate your entire potential audience with the fidelity to make sure you never released bad works. However, simulations of this fidelity would amount to ~people watching your bad movies.
[23:44:18] <gwern> I mean even just the randomness of the world. thermal noise in the brain meaning one person decides to link it on their uber-popular tiktok
[23:44:31] <gwern> the tiktok bandit algorithm giving up on that tiktok post a little too early
[23:44:53] <gwern> the right person failing to see it because traffic was heavy that night and they were busy
[23:44:58] <dbohdan[phone]> Right. You can't simulate your way out of this.

[23:53:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The counter argument of course is ‘planned arrangements of societies according to some ideal hasn’t gone well in the past, maybe we should study what things actually work and be concerned with what’s effective given how humans and systems tend to behave’. But of course how humans tend to behave is also a product of culture (more evidence of injustice!) and this kind of reply is less appealing in other domains e.g. if
[23:53:09] <Obormot\Arcturus>  government officials keep being corrupt, you don’t say ‘well maybe instead of calling this state of affairs unjust we should remember what human nature is like, and design systems around it, think about what’s more effective, have a positive narrative’ – most of us would say that though what’s effective matters, this nevertheless seems to be an unjust state of affairs and we should label it as such." ... no!
[23:53:09] <Obormot\Arcturus>  Wrong! Diametrically wrong! The only reason we care about corruption in the first place is that it makes for ineffective governance!
[23:54:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "> ... if you're in a 1984 dystopia, where everyone is constantly being brought low and made to suffer... it might feel nice to have your particular tormentors brought low and made to suffer, but it's unlikely to change much of anything or do much good. Even getting rid of the criminals and villains at the top of the foodchain will accomplish little, because there's no one good in your society to replace them." ... heh. Echoes

[23:54:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> “Man is born weak. He becomes strong when around him there are none stronger than he. When those of the strong who are cruel are punished, the strongest of the weak, who will also be cruel, will take their place. So I will be forced to punish everyone, and I do not want this.” "
