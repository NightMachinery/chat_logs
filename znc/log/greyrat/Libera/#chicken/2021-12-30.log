[00:31:37] <Zipheir> Bunny351: Thanks for weighing in.
[00:57:08] <Zipheir> It looks like the type checker won't even accept function arguments with --> types.
[00:58:28] <Zipheir> e.g. ((a a --> a) a b --> c) causes an "invalid type syntax" error.  Replacing the first arrow with -> makes it work (CHICKEN 5.3.0).  Odd.
[01:02:14] <jcroisant> Ah, good catch. I guess it makes some sense when you think of --> as just being shorthand for also declaring the identifier as pure. The inner function has no (global or module-level) identifier, so it can't be declared pure. It would be cool if the type checker could check that the argument was a pure function, though.

[01:03:09] <jcroisant> Although then I suppose it would get tricky if you passed an anonymous function

[17:49:24] <fantazo> zilti[m]: are you doing chicken at your company?
[17:51:12] <zilti[m]> fantazo: Yes and no, I did write two cron-triggered helper scripts in Chicken, but that's it
[17:51:47] <mario-goulart> zilti[m]: So before that you didn't try to keep it running, the code was not very clean and documentation was lacking? :-)
[17:52:08] <zilti[m]> lol :P
[17:55:29] <zilti[m]> Joking aside, the latter two are kinda correct, mario-goulart ^^ Although I have to say that, all things considered, the documentation is quite alright
[17:57:31] <mario-goulart> Cool. :-)   That was a joke, of course.  But in fact it might as well be representative of the state of most software companies. :-)
[17:58:53] <zilti[m]> True that. Thankfully I have a quite tech-savvy boss who was always wiling to give some "buffer time" in our two-week sprints for documentation, cleanup, and bugs. I'm afraid that isn't representative...
[18:01:05] <zilti[m]> All in all I promised them to stick around until we're sold and did some sort of hand-over, but after that I'll look for a new job. I'll try to find something that's not web dev
