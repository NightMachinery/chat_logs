[00:22:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because server ARM is fuckoff expensive
[00:22:04] <Bco1981> lol
[00:22:18] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: keep waiting, never gonna happen 
[00:22:27] <hans> Aurora_v_kosmose, life is too short to worry about ECC
[00:22:38] <MootPoot> Until arm gets standardized until it becomes a commodity desktop system 
[00:22:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> hans: It's more than long-enough when faulty ram can nuke all your storage during a scrub
[00:23:01] <MootPoot> The solution to that is not to put all your eggs into one basket 
[00:23:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And not scrubbing isn't a solution.
[00:23:10] <hans> what are you some kind of zfs guy?
[00:23:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Right, sure, lemme afford another 38TB of storage...
[00:23:17] <MootPoot> 3-2-1 backups 
[00:23:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> never.
[00:23:21] <Bco1981> what unstabile files system will die during a scrub ?
[00:23:31] <hans> (btrfs raid6)
[00:23:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: ZFS and btrfs verify checksums on scrubs and try to autorepair.
[00:23:52] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: that 38tb of storage is still cheaper and easier to get then any ARM ECC box you'll get 
[00:23:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: If your ram falsely marks everything as broken and actually breaks it on repairs...
[00:24:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's the case I'm worried about and why I'm currently using some energy-guzzling monstrosity as a NAS.
[00:24:18] <MootPoot> By the time arm ECC is common we'll probably have like 25tb HAMR drives for 400 a pop
[00:24:20] <hans> oh sorry, btrfs raid56 is the unstable one * (i have no idea what raid56 even is)
[00:24:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> hans: You should use raid10 on both ZFS and btrfs anyway.
[00:25:01] <Bco1981> 10 only allows 1 disk failure
[00:25:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MTBF makes raid56 rebuilds risky.
[00:25:24] <hans> Bco1981, its complicated, but yeah worst case 1 disk failure, best-case 50% disk failure
[00:25:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: btrfs allows for the rough equivalent of raid10c3 when used in profile raid1c3
[00:25:29] <hans> err sorry
[00:25:37] <hans> worst case 2 disk failures, best case 50% disk failures*
[00:25:47] <hans> for data loss
[00:25:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> btrfs allows up to raid1c4 currently.
[00:26:02] <MootPoot> I would really like to know how often 2 or more disk failures happen 
[00:26:05] <MootPoot> Like really 
[00:26:28] <hans> iirc btrfs sucks at raid1 tho
[00:26:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: More often than you'd think, especially if you don't use simple mirrors and use the IO-expensive and super-slow parity rebuilds.
[00:26:45] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: what does that mean 
[00:26:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> hans: I haven't noticed any issues saturating my network links.
[00:26:51] <hans> btrfs doesn't properly optimize read performance for raid1c*
[00:27:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Basically, you'd have the second drive fail while rebuilding a replacement drive.
[00:27:12] <hans> like on raid1c3 it only reads on the first 2 disks, or only the first disk
[00:27:23] <hans> ... last i checked, which was over a year ago
[00:27:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> hans: Even unoptimized it's decent.
[00:27:30] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: no I mean "more often then you think" 
[00:27:38] <MootPoot> What does that mean in actual numbers 
[00:27:39] <MootPoot> Lol
[00:27:50] <MootPoot> Are we talking like 2% over 5 years 
[00:28:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: The thing is I'm not privy to failure rates in DCs. the "theory" maths says that you're basically guaranteeing double failure and raid failure with 8TB drives in raid5 during rebuild.
[00:28:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The reality isn't quite that clear cut.

[00:32:45] <MootPoot> Wym weirdly 
[00:32:53] <MootPoot> Ofc there are lol
[00:33:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: x86 is usually stupidly power hungry. So low-power is surprising.
[00:33:23] * MootPoot shrugs
[00:33:51] <MootPoot> I'm still wondering why youre concerned over an negligible amount of power 
[00:33:56] <MootPoot> But you do you 
[00:34:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: 100w idle (nevermind hot) is noticeable on a power bill.
[00:34:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's enough for the purchase of new LCD monitors to pay for itself inside a year.
[00:34:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Going from >120w monitors to ~20w)
[00:35:22] <MootPoot> sure, I guess
[00:35:30] <MootPoot> how much is your power in Kwh / usd 
[00:35:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I won't share that, due to that information being very locality-indicative.
[00:35:56] <MootPoot> *sigh*
[00:36:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Just consider that it'd actually be worthwhile to pay a few hundreds over at most two years to reduce power consumption.
[00:36:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And servers having a useful live of >10y, it'd definitely pay itself back.
[00:36:51] <MootPoot> okay, then you've already localized yourself with that statement lol
[00:37:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Not really, very few places have electricity cheap-enough for that not to be the case.
[00:37:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> EU & US have it expensive-enough I could be pretty much anywhere in them.
[00:37:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm willing to readily give away I'm not anywhere in Africa
[00:37:58] <MootPoot> expensive enough?
[00:38:00] <MootPoot> define that
[00:38:08] <MootPoot> I pay like 0.05 USD per KwH
[00:38:14] <hans> ....
[00:38:15] <hans> where
[00:38:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> People on this channel pay hundreds per month on air conditioning in USA.
[00:38:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Which is completely absurd.
[00:38:35] <MootPoot> I know dwn where butter is he pays like 0.10 or 12
[00:38:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (The cost, not the need for AC)
[00:38:46] <MootPoot> hans: canaderp
[00:39:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Of course raw cost isn't all that matters. 0.10 USD per KwH is a lot more painful if your yearly income is 20K USD than 120K
[00:40:12] <MootPoot> true but you're also talking about having like a 38tb storage sever
[00:40:28] <MootPoot> so you live somewhere decently expensive, and you make a decent amount of income as well
[00:40:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It took a while to build it up to that. Definitely not something I did overnight.
[00:40:40] <MootPoot> anyway - trying to pointlessly locate you aside
[00:41:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And the odd number does correctly suggest "large array of cheap drives" rather than "small array of 12TB+ drives"
[00:41:17] <MootPoot> just build up to another dupliate 38tb or if you're already willing to put in THAT much money for a return on power - go get some solar rigged up
[00:41:33] <MootPoot> to offset your cost
[00:41:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I don't own the building. :/

[00:42:18] <MootPoot> that wont help
[00:43:07] <Bco1981> maybe i should check prices on hdd's
[00:43:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: Pandemic and proof of storage bullshit has done weird things to storage.
[00:43:47] <MootPoot> Bco1981: I scored 2*18TB seagate EXOS drives for like 450 usd a pop
[00:43:48] <MootPoot> brand new
[00:43:55] <MootPoot> or was it 400
[00:43:57] <MootPoot> dont remember
[00:43:59] <MootPoot> cheap af though
[00:44:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The thing with 18TB drives is that it's a lot more painful to replace a failed one than a 4TB redundancy drive.
[00:44:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It requires a lot tighter budgetting too.
[00:45:04] <MootPoot> by the time that'll ever be a concern , 18tb's will probably have halved in price
[00:45:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: I saw them increase during the pandemic.
[00:45:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> 8TB was almost affordable when it started and then it doubled.

[02:36:47] <Smeef> I just bought the GPD Pocket 3 on Indiegogo, really hope I don't regret this purchase. Anyone here ever bought anything from Indiegogo?
[02:37:18] <Bco1981> why not steamdeck ?
[02:37:35] <analoq> well can't get worse than smachz
[02:37:36] <Smeef> Because the Pocket 3 has a build in KVM
[02:37:59] <Smeef> I can plug it into a friggin server and use it as a keyboard/mouse/monitor
[02:38:21] <Smeef> How wicked is that?
[02:38:22] <analoq> not really comparable are they? yours looks like a notebook
[02:38:48] <Smeef> Yeah, and it has specs that kick the crap out of an XPS 15 for 2/3 the price
[02:39:30] <analoq> wow an i7. i thought it would be some kind of ARM abomination :D
[02:40:43] <Smeef> 11th Gen i7, 16GB DDR4, Xe Graphics with 96 Execution Units, 1TB storage, Thunderbolt 4, 4096 pressure levels capacitive touch screen, and that sweet-ass expansion port that can take the KVM module or a bunch of other modules.
[02:41:03] <analoq> well afaik gpd has a solid track record. i doubt you will face any delivery issues
[02:42:06] <Smeef> The only thing it doesn't seem to have is a SD card slot and non-upgradable RAM
[02:42:31] <analoq> eh 16gb should be sufficient for such a unit
[02:42:57] <Smeef> If it runs CEMU smoothly, it might just replace my desktop with that Thunderbolt 4 port, lol
[02:43:17] <analoq> this whole upgradablility thing is overblown imho. Just buy a proper model and you won't have to upgrade ram/cpu
[02:43:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> analoq: In the long term that doesn't really work out.
[02:43:36] <analoq> at the point where i want to upgrade the whole platform has become incompatible anyways
[02:43:42] <Smeef> Yeah, 16GB is fine, especially since my Surface Pro has zero upgradability, I might just sell it
[02:43:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Buying a system pre-maxed out is expensive.
[02:43:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Buy 1 stick of 32GB ram, leave the other 11 slots free.
[02:43:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Then grow it as you get money.
[02:44:06] <analoq> Aurora_v_kosmose: longterm you cant upgrade anyways because there will be a different socket at that point
[02:44:13] <Smeef> ^
[02:44:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> analoq: You can find the new-old stock
[02:44:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And it's going to be cheaper since no one wants it anymore.
[02:44:34] <analoq> but that stuff is all comparable to what you have already anyways
[02:44:43] <analoq> speed wise
[02:44:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Also, careful with thunderbolt. There's security implications Intel has yet to address, iirc
[02:44:55] <Smeef> I can see that applying to a desktop, I don't see it applying to an ultraportable

[02:48:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Virtualization is really the main use-case for that much memory.
[02:48:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because the industry, for some strange reason, has yet to standardize instead around some glue library to run stuff atop seL4 or Genode instead for minimal memory cost.
[02:48:56] <Bco1981> for each 4 cores, 16gb ram.
[02:48:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> As native programs.
[02:49:04] <analoq> Smeef: there is one 'upgrade' the 5775C 
[02:49:14] <analoq> but not worth the effort imho
[02:49:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Of course part of the issue is such a library not existing yet.
[02:49:28] <Smeef> I also just ordered the first batch of items for the first PC I'm building for myself in about 7 years
[02:49:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But yeah, something like MinGW for seL4 would be amazing.
[02:50:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Currently the closest is unikernel programs run as VMs... which leaves much to be desired.

[03:38:17] <Satin> i still have bullet holes :^)
[03:38:26] <Satin> in the car, and a bullet inside me
[03:38:30] <Satin> meh idk

[03:39:00] <Satin> one of the holes in my steering wheel :^)
[03:39:06] <analoq> i know someone who got his brand new company car mugged at gunpoint on his first day in South africa. But at least noone shot
[03:39:11] <Satin> from underneath
[03:39:25] <Satin> yeah i took in 5 bullets and almost bled to death, very barely survived
[03:39:36] <Satin> but that's a whole other story ig
[03:39:42] <analoq> i mean i get the guns for intimindation. but a mugging a car vs. being hunted for murder... whats the logic
[03:39:59] <Satin> i was baited outside of my car after i got in with the customer's order etc
[03:40:03] <analoq> being used for intimidation*
[03:40:33] <Satin> and when they grabbed my arms/hands, i shrieked basically, wrung the guy's hands off me, spun over to my car even without a remote fob at the time and got in etc
[03:40:41] <analoq> wait you were actually hit? o.o
[03:40:46] <Satin> yeah?
[03:40:48] <analoq> did they get the perps?
[03:41:05] <Satin> maybe. prosecutors won't tell me the exact details because they want witness testimony
[03:41:21] <Satin> but yes, I took in 5 bullets, almost died, and i'm still recovering from ptsd and all of that stuff
[03:41:26] <Satin> was in the ICU for most of jan 2021
[03:41:31] <analoq> dont you have a right to know?
[03:41:51] <analoq> that's insane
[03:41:53] <Satin> nah, the detective won't tell me if they definitely have him in custody or not
[03:41:59] <Satin> he hinted that they might but he wants a clear confession
[03:42:05] <Satin> from the guy
[03:42:13] <Satin> but he aalso wants unbiased testimony from me
[03:42:15] <analoq> but how does telling you about it hinder that?
[03:42:32] <Satin> US legal system/law which makes sense
[03:42:41] <analoq> i mean if it is plausible and you agree with it, it's fine i guess
[03:42:47] <Satin> the minute he tells me or any other victim things
[03:42:57] <Satin> our already fuzzy memories and stuff might get influenced by that information

[03:43:30] <Satin> (police are often caught planting evidence in other cases so)
[03:43:38] <analoq> well if he doesnt know that the person he caught is the shooter then he can't say they have him 
[03:43:52] <Satin> yeah he doesn't know 100% from what i could tell 
[03:43:54] *** Joins: betelgeuse (~betelgeus@94-225-47-8.access.telenet.be)
[03:43:59] <Satin> but he just had me come over, and pick from a photo line
[03:44:05] <Satin> after recording my testimony
[03:44:14] <Satin> like in a stereotypical hollywood movie scene or something lol
[03:44:23] <analoq> so then he kind of told you everything anyways. they have suspects but no proof
[03:44:26] <Satin> except obv he used an iphone instead of a tape recorder
[03:44:29] <Satin> yeah
[03:44:48] <Satin> he hinted "we might have him for something else, and your charges might add to that. but it's an uphill case"
[03:44:49] <analoq> i am guessing you dont really remember how he looks?
[03:44:55] <Satin> I do not, not very clearly
[03:45:01] <analoq> understandable
[03:45:03] <Satin> it was 8 pm, in december
[03:45:05] <Satin> darkish
[03:45:11] <Satin> and the guy was wearing masks
[03:45:16] <analoq> and shooting :P
[03:45:20] <Satin> and when I was baited out of the car, I looked at the tire
[03:45:31] <Satin> after getting out, thinking they were trying to tell me something was warong with it
[03:45:43] <Satin> the security footage from the store CCTV is very clear about that part 
[03:45:59] <Satin> analoq: yeah ontop of that i was sedated heavily, painkillers, opoids, whatever, hallucinations and all of that
[03:46:00] <analoq> disgusting to abuse trust
[03:46:14] <Satin> and trauma mechanisms mean it's hard to remember all the details
[03:46:23] <Satin> i'm lucky i don't get many nightmares
[03:46:32] <Satin> or remember my dreams much unlike other victims lol
[03:46:46] <analoq> it's why i don't help people. the first thing i do when some random person engages me is to find the angle/ scam they are trying to pull :/
[03:46:54] <Satin> meh
[03:47:09] <Satin> i was a more naive 21 year old suburbanite
[03:47:19] <Satin> that wasn't used to the inner city parts of my city #americamoment
[03:47:32] <analoq> nah you did nothing wrong.
[03:47:47] <Satin> i'm less naive now, I don't go to the gas station at 3 am for energy drinks or anything like before
[03:48:02] <analoq> the problem is that now you will behave like me, making the world a colder place~
[03:48:08] <Satin> i hate how i can't help but be susipicous of any slightly off looking stranger now 
[03:48:19] <Satin> I try not to but i can't help it lol
[03:48:34] <Satin> I've had episodes where outside of a chinese takeout place, i had to go inside to get my order at night
[03:48:39] <Satin> and the car next to me was tinted heavily etc
[03:48:53] <Satin> and that triggered the fuck out of my pTSD hyperviligance stuff, so i started making weird plans etc in my head etc 
[03:49:09] <Satin> and right up till those guys from that car came behind me - a group of three young men
[03:49:22] <Satin> i was making plans without realizing for how i would escape, nothing happened. obviously.
[03:49:27] <analoq> i kinda grew up with it. dad used to work in a somewhat problematic government position. so even when i was young i would question people on the phone, not say my name on the phone. i got that drilled into me from the get go
[03:49:32] <Satin> but i dropped my keys on the way to my car because of how much i was shaking LMaO
[03:49:46] <Satin> i see
[03:50:01] <analoq> luckily shootings are basically non existant here~
[03:50:06] <Satin> yeah I'm not naturally like that. I'm becoming like that slowly but yeah
[03:50:16] <Satin> analoq: arguably it's not that common here either for many people
[03:50:19] <Satin> but uh
[03:50:30] <Satin> yeah.... clearly more than other developed nations
[03:50:44] <analoq> idk if i look at reddit it feels like every day you aren't witnessing a shooting in the us is a good day :P
[03:50:49] <Satin> LOL
[03:51:06] <Satin> most people I know from my city were shocked/surprised too, it's "safe" a lot of the times
[03:51:17] <Satin> but at the end of the day yeah, our baseline of safety is sadly so low
[03:51:23] <Satin> compared to where it shoud be
[03:51:38] <Satin> but yeah anyways, didn't mean to take this to that tangent - but that's why my car has been through a lot partly :)
[03:52:04] <Satin> I feel maybe it saved my life partly,:p
[03:52:06] <analoq> i gotta ask how high was the medical bill ;D
[03:52:10] <Satin> 30k+
[03:52:14] <Satin> USD
[03:52:16] <analoq> hm i expected more
[03:52:26] <analoq> i see bills for 1k for a one night stay
[03:52:32] <Satin> ya I'm in in the midwest so it's a bit more sane than before i guess
[03:52:39] <Satin> i mean the ambulence stuff
[03:52:44] <analoq> i see. still insane. i assume you didnt have to cover that?
[03:52:52] <Satin> I'm super grateful because the surgeron doctor told my dad that
[03:53:01] <Satin> had i been 5 minutes late to the operating theaater, i'd have passed away
[03:53:04] <Satin> from all the bleeding/injuries
[03:53:07] <Satin> but
[03:53:09] <analoq> wow
[03:53:21] *** Quits: makiseKurisu (~user@exc222.neoplus.adsl.tpnet.pl) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:53:50] <Satin> yeah lol, i went ucnonsicous and stuff but i remmbemre breiefly waking up in pain and hearing parademics distortiations or something say something about giving me more fetynal and then i went blank
[03:53:51] <Satin> but anyways
[03:53:57] <Satin> the ambulence ride, as much as i'm grateful for it.... cost like 1-2k
[03:54:18] <Satin> for only 2-3 miles
[03:54:18] <Satin> sheesh
[03:54:24] <analoq> :D
[03:55:01] <analoq> i hate a lot of things here, but not having to face insane medical bills is certainly a plus here that i wouldnt want to miss
[03:55:38] <analoq> then again im spending insane amounts of money on medical insurance...like ~300/month or so
[03:55:38] <Satin> Yeah for sure
[03:55:58] <analoq> so every 10years i could afford a shooting :/
[03:56:32] <Satin> ... 300/month is rather cheap
[03:57:33] <analoq> well it doesn't cover everything. teeth still can get expensive. but the life changing stuff is certainly covered

[04:07:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: Can't you try and argue it down with their invoice department?
[04:07:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Apparently that's a thing according to some posts on the interwebz
[04:07:33] <Satin> nah
[04:07:55] <Satin> I mean to be clear, my family's healthcare insurance company
[04:07:58] <Satin> and them negotiate
[04:08:13] <analoq> it's insane that you even have to pay it. you are a victim of the crime but have to pay?
[04:08:15] <Satin> also doordash involved in some of it, even though, as a gig emp loyer, not obligated to by law
[04:08:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ah, so you have insurance doing the negociation instead
[04:08:21] <Satin> cuz not covered under victim comp
[04:08:32] <Satin> but in the end we do still pay some of it
[04:08:32] <analoq> what's the lesson here? don't get shot next time?
[04:08:42] <Satin> analoq: idk lol
[04:08:45] <Satin> yeah ig so xd
[04:08:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> analoq: Carry a bigger gun, a hacksaw and large garbage bagsK to put themi
[04:08:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Basically.
[04:09:32] <Satin> I'm going to get a gun in the next 2 years, once i calm down more, not in a hurry
[04:09:36] <Satin> but i'll get one at some point now
[04:09:56] <analoq> if it makes you feel safer great, but honestly do you think it would have helped in that scenario?
[04:09:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: In the meantime get yourself an emegergency flare gun.

[04:12:44] <Satin> the fuck lol
[04:12:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Moron decided to charge, got shot for his trouble.
[04:12:46] <Satin> christ
[04:12:50] <Satin> Yeah
[04:13:16] <MootPoot> Satin: you need hugs
[04:13:21] <MootPoot> get a large dog
[04:13:30] <Satin> parents never allowed pets growing up etc
[04:13:35] <Satin> and i don't think i can get one at my rental
[04:13:37] <Satin> but yes
[04:13:40] <MootPoot> I made coconut flour bread
[04:13:41] <Satin> i'd get a cat if i could
[04:13:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That too, but hugs could also feel constraining/claustrophobic. Not sure how Satin is so maybe not
[04:13:46] <MootPoot> well - its still batter
[04:13:47] <Satin> MootPoot: nice
[04:14:32] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: I'm okay with them :) thankfully my PTSD is a bit more uh, nuanced, and not explicit in my face so i can lead a mostly normal life it feels
[04:14:37] <Satin> but it's a double edged sword
[04:14:53] <Satin> i've been gaslighting myself or something into thinking it's not a big deal
[04:15:07] <Satin> started this semester of school as if everything was normal and then gradually paid the price
[04:15:26] <Satin> my physics professor was really kind and her observations and kind words made me realize that i was downplaying some of it 
[04:15:34] <analoq> yeah not being able to measure it, makes it difficult to know when it's justified and when ones overreacting
[04:15:51] <Satin> yeah, i just have a hard time internalizing that i have it or how it affects me
[04:16:01] <Satin> + mental helath stigmatizing religious baptist family
[04:16:05] <Satin> + my own ego lulz
[04:16:31] <Satin> + not knowing what ptsd was besides that "thing that car accident viticms and war veterans get?" before i started to comphrend what it was myself recently
[04:16:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah the family seems... like a problem.
[04:16:39] <Satin> they are
[04:16:54] <Satin> but i purposely moved out to new mexico for school for a reason so i could get tf away
[04:17:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> PTSD can be caused by pretty much any undue too intense or too long period of stress.
[04:17:20] <Satin> yeah, and it's ........hard to understand or believe when you come from an environment like this
[04:17:33] <Satin> like logically yes, I tell plenty of friends when I'm playing a supportive role the same things
[04:17:38] <Satin> but applying  it to myself? pfft.
[04:18:02] <Satin> Funny how that works. 
[04:18:37] <Satin> But yeah. I withdrew from classes and I'm going to soon try to figure out a non-telehealth mental clinic appointment that supports my insurance hopefully
[04:18:45] <MootPoot> its cool when somebody else is getting help but getting yourself help is kinda cringe
[04:18:46] <MootPoot> basically
[04:18:46] <Satin> because protip from me: don't start school with untreated PTSD :))))
[04:18:50] <analoq> makes me wonder how may get away with murder. I mean it is so simple, shoot a random person in the dark and i bet it is very likely that you never get caught :|
[04:18:53] <Satin> MootPoot: ya
[04:18:59] <Satin> or at least harder
[04:19:11] <Satin> (fuck telehealth btw)
[04:19:31] <analoq> oof https://projectcoldcase.org/cold-case-homicide-stats/
[04:19:32] <ImoutoBot> [title] Cold Case Homicide Stats - Project: Cold Case
[04:19:38] <Satin> (and almost everything is telehealth for psychathrist services right now)
[04:19:43] <analoq> it's basically a 50% chance that you get away
[04:19:59] <Satin> yeah
[04:20:34] <Satin> MootPoot: would you prefer virtual or in person if you were getting mental health related appointments
[04:20:40] <analoq> probably much higher seeing that most are likely murders with some kind of motif that you can follow
[04:20:49] <MootPoot> Virtual ofc Satin 
[04:20:55] <analoq> motive*
[04:21:00] <MootPoot> Easier to talk to a screen 
[04:21:02] <Satin> interesting
[04:21:10] <MootPoot> Maybe after a few months irl
[04:21:14] <MootPoot> But screen to start 
[04:21:15] <MootPoot> No doubt 
[04:21:27] <Satin> opposite here, I'm bad in groups, but I'm very heavily into connecting with people one on one hmmm
[04:21:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> > don't start school with untreated PTSD > s/school/cause of major stress and sleep deprivation/ | You don't say.
[04:21:43] <Satin> and it feels weird and wrong when i say stuff to someone like a therapist through zoom
[04:21:52] <Satin> like i'm taking up their time or whatever 
[04:22:04] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: yeah Lmao
[04:22:16] <analoq> there was an ama by psychathrist on reddit who played games with his patients as a way to open them up :p
[04:22:20] <Satin> MootPoot:  have you always been someone that prefers virtual stuff
[04:22:39] <MootPoot> Satin: I'm a proper zoomer 
[04:22:42] <Satin> or was youngling pooters different
[04:22:45] <Satin> MootPoot: lol fair
[04:22:47] <MootPoot> I had a computer before I had friends 
[04:22:55] <MootPoot> Or school
[04:23:01] <Satin> same but i was homeschooled so my circumstances were exceptional
[04:23:16] <MootPoot> There's never been a single time in my life when I wasent connected somehow 
[04:23:20] <analoq> virtual is so much better. i can just mute myself do other shit. it's like being in multiple places at the same time

[04:32:35] <Satin> afk brb 30m family devotion time /rollingeyes
[04:32:35] <MootPoot> It would be awesome if my discord friends could stick to like
[04:32:36] <MootPoot> one game
[04:32:41] <MootPoot> but they change it every 10min
[04:35:29] <Satin> I lied I logged in from my new phone under the blanket 
[04:35:46] <Satin> MootPoot: yeah lol that can be hella annoying
[04:36:00] <Satin> What do you prefer playing yourself often then 
[04:36:20] <MootPoot> just working through single player game backlog 
[04:36:33] <MootPoot> red dead redemption 2, sekiro, half life alyx etc

[06:22:47] <MootPoot> so its a bacterial culture?
[06:22:51] <Sadale> Too bad. There're three active lewd users rightr now. Namely Satin, MootPoot and ButterNoodle. So Satin, you know what you'd be expecting for this convo xD
[06:23:12] <MootPoot> Satin: tell me about ur bacterial culture :P
[06:23:36] <MootPoot> at what point does it go from natrual to artifical

[06:33:48] <Sadale> ok. I hope that I can finish testing DST handling for my clock by the end of today.
[06:34:25] <Sadale> Now that I come to think of it, it may not be qualified as being an "IoT" clock at all because it doesn't connect to the internet 24/7. Maybe it'd be better to call it internet-synchronized clock
[06:35:42] <MootPoot> cock clock
[06:35:58] <MootPoot> Sadale: how do your buyers know if you're spying on them with that?"
[06:36:05] <Sadale> don't put the clock into your pussy/ass.
[06:36:15] <MootPoot> Sadale is trying to spy on ppl
[06:36:30] <Sadale> MootPoot, mostly just trust. Honestly there'd barely be any market for that. I expect to sell like 10 units or so.
[06:36:37] <Sadale> MootPoot, And it's FOSS.
[06:37:00] <MootPoot> for something this smol I doubt that anyone would bother to audit it even if it was FOSS

[06:40:19] <ButterNoodle> yes
[06:40:27] <MootPoot> so apparently there was some girl who was in HS

[06:40:38] <MootPoot> used it
[06:40:42] <Sadale> lolwut
[06:40:45] <Sadale> not cool
[06:40:52] <Sadale> not cool to use other's dildo
[06:40:52] <MootPoot> wondered why her dad's name was stamped on it 
[06:40:54] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: I read that
[06:41:00] <MootPoot> then a long time after she realized
[06:41:01] <Sadale> lolololol
[06:41:05] <MootPoot> it was a mould of her dads cock

[06:41:12] <ButterNoodle> *not bad mom
[06:41:28] <Sadale> If it's a mold she could just clone the dildo.
[06:41:29] <MootPoot> does that count as incest at that point
[06:41:34] <ButterNoodle> naa
[06:42:00] <ButterNoodle> just like if Sadale made a copy of his member.. and his sister tried it out.. although exciting - not incest
[06:42:05] <ButterNoodle> ahem..
[06:42:09] <ButterNoodle> it could lead to incest

[06:58:51] <MootPoot> those 48MP pics are nice tho
[06:59:55] <Sadale> so the first month is $10. And the subsequent ones are far more expensive.
[07:00:12] <MootPoot> yeah the normal price is wayyy too much
[07:00:13] <MootPoot> fuck that
[07:00:22] <MootPoot> just get that one month and thats it

[07:00:32] <MootPoot> or tell me which one you want and I'll download it for you and send it over :P
[07:00:38] <MootPoot> Sadale: nah, impossible
[07:00:53] <MootPoot> its dead obvious with the image quality and noise once you see it at 100%
[07:00:56] <Sadale> Is 48MP camera that common in professional photography tho?
[07:01:07] <Sadale> I mean even professional gear would have noise.
[07:01:11] <MootPoot> depends on the type of camera
[07:01:24] <MootPoot> but yeah there are like 100+MP professional DSLRs and stuff
[07:01:47] <MootPoot> Sadale: there is noise but ofc the noise of this and the noise of a tiny smartphone sensor are completely differen
[07:01:57] <Sadale> ah
[07:02:03] <Sadale> fair enough
[07:02:37] <MootPoot> I can send you a pic

[07:11:41] <MootPoot> we can come back here
[07:12:03] <Sadale> MootPoot, I still don't get it about the noise-free thingie. It seems to have noise.
[07:12:18] <MootPoot> nothing is noise free
[07:12:23] <MootPoot> it just has much less noise
[07:12:27] <MootPoot> compared to a smartphone camera
[07:12:32] <MootPoot> due to the massive sensor
[07:12:51] <MootPoot> but those kinds of pics wont be produced by a smartphone anytime soon
[07:12:53] <Sadale> MootPoot, let me show you one of the pic I've taken with my new smartphone tho.
[07:15:07] <MootPoot> I have a LG v60
[07:15:12] <MootPoot> it takes 64mp pics
[07:15:31] <MootPoot> and those are shit compared to the 18mp or 24 shots from here
[07:16:47] <Sadale> MootPoot, actually I don't think I've got a comparable pic right now.
[07:17:05] <Sadale> MootPoot, I've got an outdoor pic. But it's well-lit. Maybe that's why it look mostly noise-free
[07:17:08] <ButterNoodle> fucks going on in here

[07:18:50] <MootPoot> I have a similar level of camera
[07:18:55] <Sadale> I dunno. I just find the one that you've posted even noiser than the smartphone.
[07:19:08] <Sadale> Maybe smartphone does all those post-processing magic. I dunno
[07:19:16] <MootPoot> maybe
[07:19:21] <MootPoot> these are raw images so
[07:19:44] <Sadale> To be fair tho I took the photo in 108MP. And the noise is noticable. But if I scale down to 12MP, the noise aren't quite noticable.

[08:12:02] <MootPoot> server fucked up
[08:12:12] <MootPoot> too big bring back or mail
[08:12:22] <MootPoot> buying a dell R610 now
[08:12:28] <MootPoot> gonna sell that one there remotely
[08:12:37] <ButterNoodle> nice!
[08:12:59] <MootPoot> better cpus, 3.5" drives, dont need to buy caddies
[08:13:01] <ButterNoodle> no r720s?
[08:13:05] <MootPoot> 3.4 ghz max or osmething
[08:13:09] <ButterNoodle> comes w caddies?
[08:13:14] <MootPoot> comes with
[08:13:19] <MootPoot> for about 80 usd
[08:13:25] <ButterNoodle> yea thats a deal
[08:13:26] <MootPoot> dual PSU , 24gb ECC
[08:13:36] <ButterNoodle> trays are 8-15 a piece 
[08:14:21] <MootPoot> I would get the r710 but for some reason the price literally doubles for them
[08:14:23] <MootPoot> this is about 80
[08:14:36] <MootPoot> r710 with less ram and basically the same cpu is like  200
[08:14:49] <MootPoot> not worth imo
[08:15:08] <ButterNoodle> doesnt make sense.. idk.. the 710 has more ram slots??
[08:15:23] <MootPoot> some of them come with RAID cards..thats about it
[08:15:24] <ButterNoodle> ik the 720 vs 620 is a big difference
[08:15:30] <MootPoot> is it?
[08:15:41] <MootPoot> is it worth over 2x the price
[08:15:44] <ButterNoodle> 720 has 24 ram slots and better raid
[08:15:54] <MootPoot> ehh, I dont really need those things
[08:15:54] <ButterNoodle> if ur not gonna use all the expansion. no
[08:16:01] <MootPoot> yeah I have my own NAS box
[08:16:04] <MootPoot> dont need storage on it
[08:16:21] <ButterNoodle> the ram slots would be the only thing.. but u can just use denser ram
[08:16:41] <ButterNoodle> I think u can use 16gb sticks w that generation of cpu

[10:12:14] <MootPoot> that wont work
[10:12:18] <amigojapan> It's mirroring
[10:12:21] <MootPoot> when your OS drive is one of them
[10:12:31] <amigojapan> Why not
[10:12:46] <MootPoot> the OS itself is supposed to RAID 0 itself?
[10:13:16] <amigojapan> Yes, well it could be a reason to use a hardware raid
[10:13:29] <MootPoot> yes, but even hardware raid is managed by the OS
[10:13:36] <amigojapan> No
[10:13:48] <amigojapan> It's independent of the OS
[10:13:54] <MootPoot> hmm
[10:14:04] * MootPoot looks up the prices of RAID cards
[10:14:13] <MootPoot> then how do you configure it?
[10:14:17] <ButterNoodle> it comes with the box MootPoot 
[10:14:19] <amigojapan> There are cheap ones
[10:14:32] <ButterNoodle> use the hardware raid
[10:14:52] <MootPoot> already built into the unit?
[10:15:06] <amigojapan> MootPoot: after the BIOS stars it tells you to press a button to enter raid settings
[10:15:56] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: you mean built into the mobo?
[10:16:11] <MootPoot> looking at the pic, it seems like there is some kind of card in there
[10:19:25] * amigojapan raids MootPoot's computer
[10:19:34] <MootPoot> so the bios or something interacts with the RAID card even before the OS is loaded

[10:57:13] <ButterNoodle> sh kida kida me right in the heart
[10:57:15] <JesseDesu> would i be able to figure it out
[10:57:30] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: principal is the same
[10:57:38] <JesseDesu> i thought so
[10:57:44] <ButterNoodle> irl the bang is loud and the recoil is a lot more
[10:57:53] <ButterNoodle> the pressure
[10:57:54] <JesseDesu> someone put me down on a discord motorcycle channel for asking that question
[10:57:59] <JesseDesu> so i left that server

[10:58:04] <JesseDesu> fuckin jerkwad
[10:58:09] <ButterNoodle> but
[10:58:18] <ButterNoodle> airsoft is a good training tool
[10:58:26] <ButterNoodle> since many operate the same as the real thing

[12:05:13] <zoidberg> I use tmux

[12:05:57] <pretender> Aaaah I wanna go back to linux
[12:06:03] <zoidberg> screen consumes less ram but it has issues with splitting screen I think
[12:06:22] <ButterNoodle> yea I wouldnt use it for splitting terminals
[12:07:03] <zoidberg> emacs is lot better in this case actually
[12:07:14] <ButterNoodle> havent used emacs since the 90s
[12:07:17] <zoidberg> don't even need to open a bash shell
[12:07:40] <zoidberg> just M-x (I think) <bash command>
[12:07:44] <ButterNoodle> and that installer is dog shit
[12:08:37] <zoidberg> what installer? it's just stupid file extraction, the problem is with symlinks and system wide links

[13:46:40] <Satin> I have a higher wattage charger that is USB c from my sister's laptop but she's acting bitchy
[13:46:42] <Satin> Yeah
[13:47:03] <Satin> Normally Barrel but I forgot that in new Mexico

[13:47:29] <Satin> While he's not using it
[13:47:30] <amigojapan> HeTo: apple laptops won't boot even if plugged in if their charge it totally depleted. The purpose is to force you to buy a new battery if the old one is dead
[13:49:02] <amigojapan> Satin: so many you just need a more powerful charger who knows
[13:49:33] <amigojapan> Maybe*
[13:49:41] <Satin> Yeah ..
[13:49:55] <Publios_> apple makes some decent products but they charge too much because of the cool factor

[13:52:21] <Publios_> can you explain a little more for me why you think Apple is evil?
[13:52:36] <amigojapan> Publios_: for example there are ways of getting rid of YouTube ads on Android
[13:52:50] <amigojapan> Publios_: but not on Apple
[13:53:20] <amigojapan> Publios_: it is possible to run emulators on Android. But not on Apple
[13:53:46] <amigojapan> Publios_: it is possible to run a Linux desktop on Android but not on Apple
[13:54:13] <Publios_> why does Apple's inability to do this make their products evil? why is this a problem?
[13:54:14] <amigojapan> Publios_: unless you jailbreak which voids your warranty
[13:54:35] <amigojapan> Publios_: cause they block these things
[13:54:44] <Publios_> why is that wrong?

[13:55:34] <Publios_> amigojapan:  I think I know what your point is but I'm just asking you to elaborate it
[13:55:36] <Publios_> that's all
[13:55:38] <Satin> I don't agree with amigo that it's explicitly morally evil 
[13:55:39] <amigojapan> Publios_: they should never block things
[13:55:50] <Satin> But I can say it's unethical on their part 
[13:56:18] <Satin> Mmm
[13:56:25] <Publios_> apple makes and sells the product. why should they not be able to determine how certain things work?
[13:56:38] <Satin> maybe I should try buying a USB-c charger tomorrow from Walmart or microcenter 
[13:57:09] <amigojapan> Publios_: cause a user owns the device, they should make all the decisions of what they want it to do
[13:57:29] <amigojapan> Satin: it may not work
[13:57:40] <Publios_> amigojapan:  the user chose to buy the device. you don't have to buy apple products
[13:58:04] <Publios_> is it evil for a car company to make a car that only has an automatic transmission?
[13:58:12] <amigojapan> Publios_: indeed I stopped buying Apple products
[13:58:51] <Publios_> absolutely freedom isn't what makes something morally good. that's an absurd argument, imo
[13:59:16] <amigojapan> Publios_: it would be if they made your sign an EULA that said "you can't change the transmission of this car"
[13:59:57] <Publios_> amigojapan:  whether you sign one or not it would certainly void your warranty on new cars
[14:00:01] <amigojapan> Publios_: who do they think they are? God?
[14:01:26] <Publios_> amigojapan:  why should they be forced to make their technological developments null and void by requiring their devices to run on other products?
[14:01:27] <amigojapan> Publios_: countries are fighting Apple to get a "right to repair"agreement
[14:02:09] <Publios_> businesses have certain rights too
[14:02:41] <Publios_> I don't use apple products but they have a right to control certain aspects of their products
[14:02:42] <amigojapan> Publios_: anyway. I am not going back to Apple unless it is my job

[14:04:03] <Publios_> he's a smart fellow, for sure
[14:04:46] <Publios_> I dislike the Apple model of doing business but I think calling it evil is petulant and childish
[14:05:19] <Publios_> it's like a child calling their parents evil for not letting them eat candy for dinner
[14:05:24] <Publios_> ridiculous and short-sighted
[14:05:25] <amigojapan> !c petulant
[14:05:26] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: (of a person or their manner) childishly sulky or bad-tempered.
[14:06:23] <amigojapan> Publios_: in the thing you are right is that I can just avoid using Apple products. They lost a customer in me
[14:06:31] <Publios_> 'oh, apple won't let me completely rework their device and nullify all their revenue sources so they are evil'
[14:07:01] <Publios_> amigojapan:  me too
[14:07:26] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[14:07:45] <amigojapan> Publios_: that is greedy
[14:08:08] <amigojapan> Publios_: they already make plenty of revenue selling the hardware
[14:08:14] <Satin> Yeah I don't think amigo sounds very convincing about it either even if I agree with parts of it 
[14:08:36] <Satin> There's a reason why rms is not paid much attention to anymore 
[14:08:43] <amigojapan> Publios_: and they would be making more money if they stuck to making money that way

[16:19:51] <omero> weechat uses python as the main scripting languge... 
[16:20:34] <zoidberg> omero is right, irssi scripts still heavily use perl.
[16:21:01] <zoidberg> pretender: both look same actually, there's hardly any difference
[16:21:16] <zoidberg> unless you are using plain irssi without any scripts
[16:21:36] <pretender> Yeah it's plain
[16:22:12] <zoidberg> no side bar which shows the members? all joins, parts?
[16:22:27] <omero> the only thing weechat has that irssi doesnt is vertical splitting

[16:40:23] <zoidberg> yeah
[16:44:36] <zoidberg> Sadale: for just 100 usd, mega gives you 100GB in cloud for lifetime.
[16:44:58] <Sadale> zoidberg, I don't believe that it's truely lifetime. :p
[16:45:09] <Sadale> I mean the company could go bankrupt any time
[16:45:40] <zoidberg> yeah, there's also terms and conditions*
[16:47:08] <Sadale> I'm thinking if we could collaborate with the users here for hosting off-site backup for each others.
[16:47:20] <Sadale> We just need to pair up two users. Then they'll be hosting off-site backup for each others.
[16:48:14] <Sadale> As long as we somehow encrypt the files before doing the file transfer to the offsite backup, it should get rid of the legal liability of questionable files of whoever offering the backup service.
[16:48:33] <zoidberg> I wonder Sadale. Almost everyone here needs backup.
[16:48:42] <Sadale> IMO hosting at home's probably cheaper than using any third party service.
[16:49:26] <zoidberg> some say it's costly at home and go through all the trouble of setting it up and maintaining
[16:49:35] <Sadale> oh time cost.
[16:49:37] <zoidberg> doesn't it come to same cost Sadale?
[16:49:55] <Sadale> If your time isn't anything of value, I still think that hosting at home would be cheaper.
[16:50:43] <zoidberg> Sadale: how much will be the initial investment and monthly power cost?
[16:51:08] <Sadale> Raspberry pi 4 is like $100. A 4TB HDD is like another $100. An external HDD bay to USB adapter is like $50. The upfront cost would be like $250.
[16:51:55] <zoidberg> can rpi handle working 24x7?
[16:52:50] <Sadale> Power cost. Raspberry pi barely takes any power. Let's assume that it's 10W. Then we've got the HDD, let's assume another 10W. That'd be 20W in total. At 24/7 that'd be 173kWh per year, which's like $25 per year here.
[16:53:01] <Sadale> zoidberg, yes. rpi is rather reliable. I have been using it as my home server.
[16:53:26] <Sadale> Current the uptime is almost half a year
[16:53:50] <zoidberg> I see. I have imagining IBM grade servers when I think of backup machines
[16:53:52] <zoidberg> lol
[16:54:13] <Sadale> I mean what you're expecting for inter-home-based backup? xD
[16:54:32] <zoidberg> lol, probably
[16:54:54] <Sadale> OK. So the cost would be $250 upfront + $25 per year. It's still cheaper than services being offered by commercial entities.
[16:55:15] <zoidberg> what about those backup software? are they free or do they have charges?
[16:55:35] <Sadale> zoidberg, just use sshfs or NFS over ssh.
[16:55:41] <Sadale> sshfs's slow tho :(
[16:55:59] <Sadale> Oh. The HDD could break tho. But don't worry. It's just a off-site backup. In case of broken HDD, we'd just ask the victim to re-upload the backup. xD
[16:56:18] <zoidberg> lol
[16:57:11] <Sadale> I mean it makes sense. This kind of backup is for the case that your home's rekted, which's not quite likely anyway. If your home's rekted while the offsite backup got rekted at the same time, you're very unlucky.
[16:57:37] <zoidberg> yeah
[16:57:44] <Sadale> ttyl dinner
[16:57:56] <zoidberg> bon apetit 
[16:57:58] <Sadale> and actually, the 4TB HDD could be shared by multiple users.
[16:58:51] <zoidberg> nah, it would be barely sufficient for an average #anime user's hentai collection
[16:58:54] <zoidberg> :p

[18:02:24] <Matt|home> i remember watching it a long time ago.. and this is for people who have seen it - the big issue i had was that there was some kind of framing device in the beginning where it was about this guy turned into a cop or bounty hunter after he died, and then it devloved into a fighting anime
[18:02:25] <Matt|home> ?

[18:46:26] <isekaijin> (“1P relay” is when you use one character at a time. When you are done with the current character, you instantly retreat it and deploy the next one. It requires abusing the pause button to an extent that is not possible with a touch-screen interface.)

[19:24:04] <Cryowolf> Matt|home, no that's not otaku.

[23:25:06] <MootPoot> berlingo36: generally unless you shoot it or freeze it or throw it in an oven, you're fine
[23:25:13] <berlingo36> hassoon: so for tasks that require a lot of cpu power and stuff, is it better to keep on chargin or use the battery
[23:25:19] <MootPoot> the best you can do is just charge from 20-80% 
[23:25:22] <berlingo36> oh MootPoot, okay
[23:25:24] <MootPoot> if you want to extend life
[23:25:32] <berlingo36> why not from 0 to hero
[23:25:36] <berlingo36> uh um, from 0 to 100
[23:26:03] <MootPoot> its harder on your body to go from starving to overeating 
[23:26:09] <berlingo36> riight
[23:26:14] <MootPoot> same concept
[23:26:19] <berlingo36> so going back to my question
[23:26:25] <berlingo36> so for tasks that require a lot of cpu power and stuff, is it better to keep on chargin or use the battery
[23:26:30] <MootPoot> charge
[23:26:34] <berlingo36> okay
[23:26:55] <MootPoot> anything you can do to minimuze the battery being used
[23:27:04] <MootPoot> if you do use it, try to stick to 20-80
[23:27:17] <berlingo36> okay, thanks MootPoot 
[23:27:26] <MootPoot> but its not a big deal, realsically you'll have to replace it after 3.5 or 4 years anyway
[23:27:59] <MootPoot> probably best to buy a replacement within a year or two when you get more ram and just store it for replacement later
[23:28:24] <MootPoot> since if you wait too long they might stop making it, and you'll have to deal with ripoff batteries and stuff
[23:28:37] <berlingo36> oh, i see
[23:28:52] <berlingo36> will the battery stay the same when the years pass?
[23:29:01] <MootPoot> if its stored correctly, pretty much
[23:29:41] <berlingo36> are batteries expensive?
[23:30:06] <MootPoot> depends on your laptop
[23:30:15] <MootPoot> usually somewhere between 30-70 bucks for a new one
[23:30:42] <berlingo36> oh shit
[23:30:45] <berlingo36> that's expensive
[23:30:54] <Bco1981> can you even replace the battery ?
[23:31:15] <MootPoot> Yeah, one of the last things you can still do 
[23:31:16] <Bco1981> many slim laptops these days don't have a easy to replace battery
[23:31:27] <berlingo36> oh
[23:31:28] <berlingo36> welp
[23:31:29] <berlingo36> idk
[23:31:30] <MootPoot> Unless he has a Ultrabook or something
[23:31:39] <berlingo36> i can't open it because the warranty will say goodbye
[23:31:41] <MootPoot> berlingo36: go look at a teardown video for your laptop 
[23:31:58] <Bco1981> my old laptop had easy to replace battery.
[23:32:07] <berlingo36> seems fair, MootPoot 
[23:32:08] <MootPoot> But that being said 
[23:32:08] <Bco1981> this new one has a internal battery
[23:32:11] <berlingo36> gonna try taht
[23:32:25] <MootPoot> All of these things are kinda pointless imo 
[23:32:33] <MootPoot> Since at the end of the day it's a laptop
[23:32:47] <MootPoot> It's like trying to extend the life of a bottle of room temperature milk 
[23:33:40] <Bco1981> need that what's it's name frame laptop.
[23:34:07] <MootPoot> If I were you I'd use the fuck out of that laptop berlingo36 - and in the meantime just put away like 10-30 in a seperate bank account instead to save up for your next one in 5 years 
[23:35:46] <berlingo36> sounds nice
