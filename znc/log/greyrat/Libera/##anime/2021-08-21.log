[00:07:18] <snake> emmeka, i don't remember how i wanted to say this to support my argument. but chaos magic is also an idea that has an effect in real life. but it only has an effect on you if you believe it

[00:11:44] <Bco1981> Love is like a cocktail
[00:12:00] <snake> emmeka, the existence or non-existence of concepts is almost irrelevant, since it's more important to consider if they are valid, or if they represent anything real
[00:12:26] <nftdaddy> anime
[00:12:34] <Bco1981> manga
[00:12:36] <snake> i'll say that gender doesn't represent anything real, at least not in an objective way.. it is subjectively defined i think
[00:12:45] <davic> Bco1981: swedish state tv had a tv docu show about the swedish game industry
[00:12:52] <snake> anyone can be a girl, there are no prerequisites

[00:27:04] <davic> so they aint gonna fuck that up
[00:27:10] <senti> Cryowolf: nothing beats a good mattress. I've been using a tempurpedic mattress (memory foam) for almost 10 years now. I could never go back to spring mattresses.
[00:27:12] <Cryowolf> Estonia has data limits on non-premiums
[00:27:19] <davic> Cryowolf: huh
[00:27:38] <Cryowolf> senti, I think you underestimate some spring mattresses, newer ones
[00:28:13] <senti> Cryowolf: perhaps, but I doubt I'll ever give them another chance (don't want to go back to back pain all the time).
[00:28:16] <Cryowolf> I bought a wellpurr T110 Gold 160x200cm from Jysk, it was down 50% from 700 to 350 euro. My current spring mattress is 25+ years old
[00:28:58] <Bco1981> !later tell TsundereNoises https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E9Hp6AjVoAMcyLZ?format=jpg&name=4096x4096
[00:29:01] <Cryowolf> senti, they're pretty much microsprings and stuff coated in memory foam spirals and topped with cold foam and such with hundreds of comfort zones
[00:29:07] <loveorcognac> wellpurr? is it stuffed with cats?
[00:29:17] <SpiritOfSummer> anime
[00:29:25] <Cryowolf> senti, and they cost a fortune
[00:29:32] <Cryowolf> latest technology :P
[00:29:53] <senti> To be fair, I paid like $3,000 USD for my mattress, so it's a sizable investment. Imo though, something spend 8 hours on daily (ideally/optimally) is worth the investment.
[00:30:07] <Cryowolf> there's also something called "Nano Coil"
[00:30:59] <Cryowolf> I didnt have 3000 to spend on a mattress, so 350 was gonna be enough. https://jysk.se/sovrum/madrasser/skummadrasser/gold/madrass-160x200-gold-f110-wellpur Here it is if you can translate

[00:33:09] <Cryowolf> senti, what do you think? from what you understand
[00:34:50] <senti> So it's like $680 USD (or is it really just depending where you buy it)
[00:35:12] <Cryowolf> no?
[00:35:35] <Cryowolf> in full price without the sale it's on, it's 796 usd
[00:35:48] <Cryowolf> on the sale it has, it's 398
[00:35:54] <Cryowolf> or 350 euro
[00:36:31] <Cryowolf> Im reading about micro coils and hybrid mattresses and next time I upgrade and if Im rich, I'll buy one of those I think :o
[00:36:36] <senti> I've no idea how it feels to lay on, so can't really make a judgement. Also, different body types will have different needs regarding softness/support
[00:37:14] <Cryowolf> well I have 100 day "try it out" guarantee

[00:37:43] <davic> snake: having a shitty month, you?
[00:37:46] <senti> I basically went into a mattress store and tried laying on a bunch of beds (memory foam, latex, etc.) until I found what felt right. Then I entertained the salesmen's pitches for a little while, left. Then ordered the mattress I wanted online.
[00:37:52] <Cryowolf> senti, it's also the best mattress I'm gonna get for 350, there's just nothing better for that price
[00:38:08] <snake> davic, it's a little shitty, and a little great
[00:38:11] <snake> here and there
[00:38:14] <Cryowolf> unfortunately you don't often find what feels right by laying down first
[00:38:17] <snake> win some lose some
[00:38:21] <Cryowolf> cause the body temporarily likes softness etc
[00:38:29] <Cryowolf> but that might be bad in the long run

[00:39:07] <Cryowolf> hybrid mattresses are the kind with micro coils where you could place a glass of water and jump 2 cms to the right of it and it would remain stationary
[00:39:10] <senti> Cryowolf: true. But you can't make a judgement call at all if you can't try it out.
[00:39:13] <davic> snake: Estonia
[00:39:18] <snake> never heard of it
[00:39:23] <Cryowolf> senti, I will get to try it for 100 days

[00:54:51] <Cryowolf> I was selling my KRK Rokit 5 Gen 3 studio speakers
[00:55:01] <ezekielnoob> oh nice
[00:55:05] <ezekielnoob> powered monitors
[00:55:11] <Cryowolf> if youre gonna only have two, these will earthquake your building
[00:55:14] <Cryowolf> yeah theyre self powered
[00:55:25] <ezekielnoob> my bedroom is uh
[00:55:26] <Cryowolf> XLR to Line In for sound
[00:55:35] <ezekielnoob> 10 foot high
[00:55:39] <Bco1981> i still say, skip the .1 and just get two beefy speakers.
[00:55:49] <ezekielnoob> Bco1981 that is also considered
[00:55:51] <Bco1981> 12" or bigger
[00:55:53] <Cryowolf> sound from them is mostly neutral, but after that you can adjust them with software EQ etc
[00:56:03] <Cryowolf> but they have no built in EQ to fake good sound
[00:56:03] <ezekielnoob> Cryowolf im thinking of Yamaha HS8
[00:56:09] <ezekielnoob> but
[00:56:10] <Bco1981> i have two 12" speakers,,, i don't need no sub
[00:56:12] <ezekielnoob> im not trying to mix
[00:56:23] <Cryowolf> you dont need to use these to mix
[00:56:25] <Cryowolf> I use them for games
[00:56:27] <ezekielnoob> Bco1981 what speakers are those
[00:56:27] <Cryowolf> movies
[00:56:38] <Bco1981> ezekielnoob: the jamo D 265 old ones
[00:56:42] <ezekielnoob> Cryowolf im glad you're using powered montiors for this, im initially thinking they are insane
[00:56:47] <ezekielnoob> but they cna be good value also
[00:56:50] <ezekielnoob> i saw like
[00:56:51] <Bco1981> cheap but sound good
[00:56:52] <ezekielnoob> Edifier S3000
[00:56:56] <hassoon> doooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooods
[00:56:57] <ezekielnoob> it has bluetooth
[00:57:02] <Cryowolf> Im selling both of them for 180 euro
[00:57:13] <ezekielnoob> ah damn it... i do see some of them on listing Cryowolf
[00:57:19] <ezekielnoob> how far tho do you sit from those speakers
[00:57:22] <ezekielnoob> Bco1981 i see, good brand
[00:57:44] <Cryowolf> a half meter and with that I have to have volume really really really really really really really low
[00:58:02] <Cryowolf> I also had to turn down bass on the back and such to make sure the room doesnt vibrate
[00:58:13] <ezekielnoob> how big is ur room
[00:58:20] <ezekielnoob> and these are 5 inches we're talking about  right?
[00:58:22] <ezekielnoob> that's nuts
[00:58:35] <Cryowolf> if I start blasting music on them with no care, you wont need a subwoofer
[00:58:40] <Cryowolf> yeah theyre 5"
[00:58:52] <Cryowolf> KRK Rokit 5 Generation 3
[00:59:06] <ezekielnoob> how did u place them? with a floor stand?
[00:59:10] <ezekielnoob> i like their design too
[00:59:14] <ezekielnoob> with the yellow cones haha
[00:59:43] <Cryowolf> well normally you would place them with a floor stand so the tweeder(tweeter? the little black thing) is at ear level
[00:59:59] <Roey> how many kawaii's undo a guro
[01:00:00] <Cryowolf> and have them slightly angled towards you
[01:00:09] <Cryowolf> to create the sound space
[01:00:16] <ezekielnoob> i can do that, however i would prefer to place them higher and point them down Cryowolf
[01:00:26] <ezekielnoob> so that it don't take floor space, my bedroom is in a weird situation

[01:00:54] <Cryowolf> okay, well I wouldn't be selling em if I didnt need money for cancer treatments
[01:00:55] <SpiritOfSummer> the fact that this is fan made still blows me away
[01:00:59] <Cryowolf> so I really like em
[01:01:32] <Cryowolf> the sound you get from them is neutral until you modify it, so you get it as whoever made thesource of it intended
[01:01:46] <Cryowolf> there's no EQ on top of EQ on top of EQ (all hidden)
[01:02:25] <ezekielnoob> i see
[01:02:39] <Cryowolf> You need an audio interface to run them (obviously) and the best way to hook them up is into their own jack. If they share a jack with something else, it might cause interference
[01:02:54] <Cryowolf> electric outlet that is
[01:02:56] <ezekielnoob> im leaning on Edifier S3000
[01:03:04] <ezekielnoob> so that i can just connect it via bluetooth
[01:03:14] <ezekielnoob> since they are gonna be far from the projector
[01:03:33] <Cryowolf> you want true budget studio speakers?
[01:03:36] <ezekielnoob> Bco1981 are those floorstanders?
[01:03:37] <Cryowolf> Gowith Behringer
[01:03:43] <Bco1981> ezekielnoob: yes
[01:03:55] <Cryowolf> very cheap and they're not that bad
[01:04:15] <Bco1981> well you can place them on something.
[01:04:26] <ezekielnoob> i can spend $600 Bco1981 upto $1000 but i wanna build something good for now.. i don't want to overspend on audio like i did before
[01:04:31] <Cryowolf> what do 2x Edifier S3000 cost?
[01:04:32] <ezekielnoob> i used to own a Sennheser HD800
[01:04:37] <ezekielnoob> around $600
[01:04:47] <ezekielnoob> it's also a powered speaker
[01:04:48] <Bco1981> i had them on top of my shelfs in 2meter height back in the day.

[01:06:28] <ezekielnoob> it looks cute too
[01:07:00] <Cryowolf> behringer are budget and sometimes suck but sometimes alsoo really do a good release
[01:07:46] <Cryowolf> but if you want to buy Rokit 5 G4 for 400 for a pair, that's nice
[01:07:49] <Cryowolf> I'd go for it
[01:08:07] <Cryowolf> make sure you use the XLR for the line in
[01:08:10] <ezekielnoob> thanks for the feedbacks
[01:08:18] <ezekielnoob> Cryowolf yeah that would be the challenge for me
[01:08:22] <Cryowolf> it creates less interference and distortion andp rovides higher quality
[01:08:29] <ezekielnoob> so my projector only has USB/Headphone jack output
[01:08:40] <Cryowolf> but youre buying an audio interface
[01:08:41] <ezekielnoob> so i need to probably buy some kind of mixer
[01:08:43] <Cryowolf> a receiver?
[01:08:50] <ezekielnoob> yeah
[01:08:58] <Cryowolf> a receiver should have line out
[01:08:59] <ezekielnoob> i gues the thing about the Edifier S3000 is that i won't need it
[01:09:21] <ezekielnoob> it has a cool feature too that
[01:09:32] <ezekielnoob> the two speakers aren't connected to eachother
[01:09:38] <Cryowolf> you just connect the rokits to the line outs (for left and right and position them accordingly)
[01:09:40] <ezekielnoob> and yet you only have tio connect to 1
[01:09:48] <Cryowolf> yeah but better to seperate
[01:10:06] <ezekielnoob> Cryowolf how do you manage the power
[01:10:11] <ezekielnoob> do they have like a wake feature
[01:10:14] <Cryowolf> I use a steinberg UR22 audio interface, but I could hook these up to my receiver too
[01:10:25] <ezekielnoob> i don't want my powered monitors to be forgotten to be shut off after use
[01:10:35] <Cryowolf> they have a flick switch on the back and a wake feature. If no sound comes in 30 minutes, like no sound at all
[01:10:48] <Cryowolf> they "shut off" until prompted by sound
[01:10:55] <Cryowolf> takes like 0.5 seconds to get back on
[01:10:58] <ezekielnoob> ah thats' cool
[01:11:28] <Cryowolf> the flick is like with PSUs etc
[01:11:38] <Cryowolf> power supply units on pcs
[01:11:56] <Cryowolf> but other than that you just connect it from speaker to electricity and then from xlr to line out
[01:12:16] <Cryowolf> then you have volume, low and high knobs to adjust on the back for default position
[01:12:47] <SpiritOfSummer> after seeing some of my favorite anime fights on youtube in 1080p HD, it's kind of bumming me out that dubhappy's quality isn't really the best
[01:13:15] <SpiritOfSummer> then again they haven't been working for me lately anyway and I seem to have a new site that offers optional quality downloads, the only downside is it's inconvenient to navigate through 
[01:13:30] <SpiritOfSummer> dubhappy was as simple as a next button, and a browser video downloader. 
[01:13:51] <SpiritOfSummer> I think I got the entire series of Black Clover in 10 minutes with individual episode downloads 
[01:14:21] <Cryowolf> ezekielnoob, so yeah most AV Receivers will have line outs (that dont supply power, that's important)
[01:14:38] <SpiritOfSummer> it was annoying to do but once it's done, it feels nice to have internet independent access to the amount of anime that I have 
[01:14:41] <Cryowolf> yamaha that is
[01:15:27] <Cryowolf> ezekielnoob https://dt7v1i9vyp3mf.cloudfront.net/styles/news_large/s3/imagelibrary/S/SteinbergUR22_02-ykX1cHiYxHGu2_RMJ7hsoSfw2lWnCqcp.jpg here are the line outs on my steinberg ur22 audio interface
[01:15:28] <ImoutoBot> [image/jpeg] 104kB
[01:15:40] <Cryowolf> it's my computers sound card so don't confuse it with a receiver
[01:15:55] <Cryowolf> but the lineout supplies no power
[01:15:59] <ezekielnoob> that might be good enough
[01:16:17] <ezekielnoob> i think have enough budget and options, my biggest problem i think is the placement
[01:16:23] <Cryowolf> yeah but its no longer for sale and it will cost (the newer version) maybe 150-200 euro
[01:16:26] <ezekielnoob> if i mount it on the wall
[01:16:27] <Cryowolf> so just as much as a receiver
[01:16:49] <Cryowolf> and it's not just a sound card, it's also for XLR, microphones, monitoring, recording etc
[01:17:07] <ezekielnoob> i did try the JBL308 mkiii (8 inch powered monitors) they are nuts too
[01:17:09] <Cryowolf> so dont buy a steinberg audio interface for speakers
[01:17:12] <ezekielnoob> but im standing like 1 foot away
[01:18:31] <Cryowolf> Im not sure but I would guess most newer receivers have unpowered lineouts these days that are 5 inches or whatever that plug is
[01:19:23] <Cryowolf> well you have my suggestions :)

[01:19:29] <ezekielnoob> this is the one i tried

[01:19:47] <Cryowolf> they're certainly gonna give you an experience you wont forget
[01:19:58] <ezekielnoob> they $800 pair
[01:20:28] <ezekielnoob> i've been doing research for like 2 months now, but i'll update you guys what i end up with :D
[01:20:52] <Cryowolf> sorry fuck that site, it has no "reject all cookies"
[01:20:58] <Cryowolf> not gonna manually reject em all
[01:21:17] <Nanobot> Everyone knows about "ASMR ear picking" and "ASMR ear licking" videos. Out of curiosity, I just searched YouTube for "ASMR lock picking". Turns out it's a thing.

[01:22:03] <Cryowolf> those look nice
[01:22:35] <Cryowolf> if you want something very powerful and cheap, go behringer. Probably costs half of KRK and does the same thing, only budgety

[01:24:02] <Cryowolf> okay
[01:24:09] <SpiritOfSummer> does anyone have information of when the final season of Bleach will be animated
[01:24:12] <senti> Neat projector monitor setup.
[01:24:17] <SpiritOfSummer> they said 2021 and I just can't find anything after that. 
[01:24:25] <ezekielnoob> i wanna put them on floor standors but it would get in the way of the door
[01:24:31] <Cryowolf> currently my bedroom is my resting central because of my cancer and is smaller than your room
[01:24:44] <Cryowolf> Ive relocatedeverything to my bedroom tho
[01:25:03] <ezekielnoob> hmm i see well this is the only room i can put a projector on
[01:25:15] <Cryowolf> it will still work
[01:25:28] <Cryowolf> you can adjust the low and high end on the back of the studio speaker
[01:25:37] <Cryowolf> lower it or increase it
[01:25:40] <ezekielnoob> i just am not sure if placing the speakers above head and poitning it down would make it suck
[01:25:49] <Cryowolf> to fit with your rooms acoustics
[01:25:55] <ezekielnoob> yeah the room is not
[01:25:55] <Cryowolf> it would make them suck
[01:25:57] <ezekielnoob> treated
[01:26:45] <Cryowolf> the best way to create a sound space is to have them at ear level
[01:26:48] <Cryowolf> or ear levelish
[01:27:00] <ezekielnoob> yeah that's the best one
[01:27:05] <ezekielnoob> i can do it tho that way
[01:27:16] <ezekielnoob> im just trying to see if i can avoid eating floor space
[01:27:26] <Cryowolf> then youll be in your own soundspace area and have a binaural audio section
[01:27:42] <ezekielnoob> maybe carpet upgrade for my room also
[01:27:43] <Cryowolf> so basically everything there tops stereo
[01:28:31] <Cryowolf> get fiberglass intended for sound isolation. Sew it into textile, place that textile inside of frames, put a nice looking framed poster on the frame
[01:28:33] <Cryowolf> and hang it up
[01:28:54] <Cryowolf> now youve just treated the room and hidden and decorated
[01:29:59] <Cryowolf> corners you place bass collectors, you really should place them in corners (bottom and top) cause bass can get trapped and distort the sound and disturb neighbors
[01:30:03] <Cryowolf> worsen the quality
[01:30:28] *** Quits: snake (~snake@user/snake) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:31:10] <Cryowolf> the other thing I mentioned is for medium to high end frequencies. Place them strategically so the sound wont get lost bouncing around from where the speakers will first hit. Try and predict it as if youre doing geometry ezekielnoob
[01:31:59] <Cryowolf> And if you hide them behind a framed poster, nobody will know. As for the bass collector, you could just create a wedge in the entire corner and fill it with fiberglass thick enough for bass
[01:32:23] <Cryowolf> you know what I mean?
[01:32:34] <ezekielnoob> yeah hmmm
[01:33:05] <denza242> davic: 
[01:33:06] <Cryowolf> its a great way to hide acoustic treatment
[01:33:06] <denza242> davic: 
[01:33:08] <denza242> davic: 
[01:33:14] <SpiritOfSummer> why do people do that
[01:33:17] <Cryowolf> also gives the room a pretty slick design
[01:33:21] <SpiritOfSummer> is that a thing for this channel or something?
[01:33:31] <Cryowolf> do what?
[01:33:34] <SpiritOfSummer> 3 highlights
[01:34:17] <Cryowolf> Ive never heard of that ´before now
[01:34:43] <SpiritOfSummer> I'd suspect it was an issue with my client if it wasn't specific to this channel
[01:35:00] <SpiritOfSummer> Cryowolf: somebody saying somebody elses name 3 times.
[01:35:10] <Cryowolf> I know they did

[06:09:59] <amigojapan> Hi sentionics 
[06:10:05] <sentionics> how's it going, amigo?
[06:10:34] <amigojapan> sentionics: well for the most part
[06:10:45] <sentionics> cool man, me too.
[06:11:00] <amigojapan> Good good
[06:11:14] <sentionics> got all of today's hair-pulling out of the way.
[06:11:47] <amigojapan> I just got up
[06:11:47] <sentionics> working on decade-old wordpress sites sucks.
[06:12:25] <sentionics> I still have several hours before sleep is even a consideration in the making.
[06:13:18] <amigojapan> I see
[06:16:04] <Jigsy> Fucking heating is on...
[06:16:11] <Jigsy> I was trying to figure out why I'm roasting.
[06:16:26] <Jigsy> My room is like, 30 C right now.
[06:16:30] <amigojapan> Ouch Jigsy 
[06:16:31] <sentionics> Jigsy --> Meltsy
[06:16:44] <Jigsy> Timer's fucked up because of the power outage yesterday.
[06:17:25] <sentionics> Your new post-recovery routine for power outages is to reset the thermostat.

[06:17:48] <Jigsy> I only noticed when I went to brush my teeth.
[06:17:59] <Jigsy> Stood in front of the mirror and got blasted by heat.
[06:18:12] <sentionics> Your teeth were half melted...
[06:18:51] <sentionics> Does enamel even melt? I wonder.
[06:18:55] <amigojapan> Jigsy: pretty common mistakefor me to put in the heater when I mean to our on the AC or the AC when I mean to our on the heater here
[06:19:18] <Jigsy> I figured it was 'cause my PS4 is on.
[06:19:47] <sentionics> amigojapan: is Japan humid, dry, or somewhere's in-between? Over here in Louisiana it's very humid.
[06:19:58] <Jigsy> Well, going to make a start on Yakuza 6.
[06:20:00] <Jigsy> o/
[06:20:08] <sentionics> \o
[06:20:15] <amigojapan> Very humid sentionics 
[06:20:25] <sentionics> Ha, similar climates!
[06:20:27] <amigojapan> O/
[06:20:28] <sentionics> maybe.
[06:21:24] <RenAdjest> Well, at least japan has winter.
[06:21:34] <amigojapan> Yep
[06:21:46] <sentionics> We, sometimes have winter.
[06:21:54] <RenAdjest> Here there is only two seasons: raining and not-raining.
[06:21:57] <sentionics> It snowed a few years ago.
[06:22:04] <sentionics> or was that 5 years ago
[06:22:11] <sentionics> I can't keep track of years.
[06:22:39] <sentionics> RenAdjest: lol
[06:22:44] <sentionics> RenAdjest: where are you from?
[06:22:49] <RenAdjest> Indonesia
[06:23:00] <sentionics> Good friend of mine is from Indonesia!
[06:23:32] <sentionics> He says I gotta try some authentic Indonesian food.
[06:23:54] <sentionics> also, cost of living is much lower in Indonesia?
[06:24:10] <sentionics> or at least, you could bring like 30k USD and live well for a while?
[06:24:33] <RenAdjest> sentionics: yep, except in capital, you can live with 500 usd / months with luxury.
[06:24:49] <sentionics> whoa, nice!

[09:59:41] <emmeka> I have never in my life actually used a rice cooker, and never understood why one is necessary
[10:00:19] <MootPoot> I did it once
[10:00:24] <MootPoot> a long time ago
[10:00:31] <MootPoot> it turned into soggy mush
[10:00:36] <MootPoot> I undertand boiling to cook 
[10:00:39] <ButterNoodle> lol
[10:00:40] <MootPoot> I dont get the rest
[10:00:52] <theholyduck> emmeka:  mostly its the 0 brain involvement. part of it
[10:00:59] <theholyduck> you throw the marked amount of water into it
[10:01:03] <theholyduck> put the marked amount of rice in
[10:01:08] <theholyduck> put the lid on and press a button
[10:01:13] <theholyduck> and then go about your day doing whatever
[10:01:18] <MootPoot> also 0% chance of fucking up
[10:01:25] <MootPoot> and also you can throw the rice in and time it
[10:01:34] <MootPoot> so rice is cooked exactly when you get home
[10:01:37] <theholyduck> emmeka: since it will keep the rice warm for you after its done cooking aswell
[10:01:50] <theholyduck> i just put it on when i start making food
[10:01:57] <theholyduck> or considering starting to make food
[10:02:03] <theholyduck> and i will have warm perfectly cooked rice 
[10:02:03] <MootPoot> when I used to go to uni IRL

[10:03:10] <MootPoot> what is this, norwegian industrial conveyer belt rice cooker
[10:03:20] <theholyduck> emmeka:  basicly its just 1 less thing to juggle while im cooking. 
[10:03:31] <MootPoot> also I dont understand rice
[10:03:34] <theholyduck> and because of the keep hot function its timing neutral

[10:05:29] <MootPoot> for landarea, probably
[10:05:31] <MootPoot> for labour?
[10:05:33] <MootPoot> idk

[10:05:47] <drunken_senti> I'm blasted.
[10:05:50] <MootPoot> pass on the effort

[10:06:09] <drunken_senti> theholyduck: I demand music
[10:06:11] <theholyduck> it was way more effort 
[10:06:33] <theholyduck> MootPoot: like dwarf wheats as we grow now is a relativly modern invention
[10:06:52] <emmeka> MootPoot it depends where you go in the world. the rice floodplains of the Mississippi are no more labour intensive a crop than midwest corn or western wheat.

[10:10:49] <MootPoot> how long until a stack of firewood turns into chubb
[10:10:59] <emmeka> MootPoot rice also has a great benefit as a crop, and that is the polyculture of it with azolla. Basically people let rice paddies get filled with the floating freshwater fern azolla, which is a nitrogen fixer. this blocks out weeds/algae, generates a tonne of N, and doesn't bother the rice at all.
[10:11:10] <MootPoot> probably after the circlejerk

[10:14:14] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  ok. so. in real life depending on geography atleast. your farm land is just going to keep unearthing rocks
[10:14:15] <theholyduck> every year
[10:14:22] <theholyduck> which means every year you have to go around and pick up all the big rocks
[10:14:32] <emmeka> frost heave just pushes them up continually, every year, little by little

[10:15:22] <emmeka> or well, I assume it isn't the norm in the tropics, as there's no frost heave...
[10:15:28] <theholyduck> MootPoot: its not like you can just take a field and its like "woah. i can grow crops on this now and forever"
[10:15:39] <MootPoot> you cant?
[10:15:55] <ButterNoodle> lol
[10:16:03] <ButterNoodle> only if u shit on it first
[10:16:06] <theholyduck> rocks its just part of. managing the nutrients in the soil. stopping it from getting totally wrecked.
[10:16:07] <emmeka> MootPoot and paddies have the definite advantage over dryland crops of basically having weeds taken care of
[10:16:22] <emmeka> weeds are another thing that is forever
[10:16:25] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  have you heard of this little thing called the dust bowl?`
[10:16:34] <theholyduck> MootPoot: caused by impropper farming techniques
[10:16:47] <emmeka> that's not exactly a good example
[10:17:07] <theholyduck> i thought a big part of it was they compeltely fucked up the ecology of the area atleast
[10:17:07] <emmeka> the dust bowl was mostly caused by *excessive* tillage and too little fallow/shelterbelting
[10:17:22] <emmeka> not a lack of maintenance by farmers
[10:17:50] <theholyduck> sure but knowing to do those things and not do those things is part of managing the farm land

[10:18:47] <theholyduck> MootPoot: but at the time people didnt do it
[10:18:51] <emmeka> crop rotation breaks up pest populations/disease levels, and lets you distribute use of soil nutrients a bit, but it doesn't fundamentally fix the problem that when you take something out you have to put something back in.
[10:18:54] <emmeka> theholyduck yes they did.
[10:19:12] <theholyduck> i mean real farmers did. i thought the problem were all the amateur farmers in the area

[10:30:40] <emmeka> theholyduck post dust-bowl people got better at orienting fallow strips to the winds and slopes, the usual fashion now of growing grain on the highest, driest plains is to divide fields into a whole bunch of very narrow strips either following contours or just running north-south. these strips are then usually cropped in a rotation that looks either like grain->alternate crop->fallow, or grain->fallow->alternate crop->fallow.

[11:05:21] <theholyduck> but like part of building a fire is creating good airflow for the fire

[12:49:57] <Sadale> Does anyone have recommendation on USB dongle that has decent WiFi strength that works well on linux? I've tried a few ones without luck. :(
[12:50:29] <theholyduck> i dont think usb wifi cards are great 
[12:50:32] <theholyduck> just in general
[12:50:33] <rando25892> oh yeah you dont like the cheap edimax?
[12:50:52] <theholyduck> Sadale:  any reason why you cant fit a real wifi card on your computer?
[12:51:01] <rando25892> it disconnects?
[12:51:03] <theholyduck> like pci-e or using a m.2/nvme slot
[12:51:15] <Sadale> rando25892, I've actually got a tiny edimax. It works well in close range. Not in further range
[12:51:20] <Sadale> theholyduck, yes. Custom computer case.
[12:51:32] <theholyduck> custom computer case doesnt make that impossible
[12:51:46] <theholyduck> you can get a mini wifi card that will fit in a NVME style slot
[12:51:47] <Sadale> The M2 one may work tho. But I'd like to save the slot for something else in case I need it
[12:52:02] <theholyduck> most mobos have a few of those now
[12:52:04] <rando25892> how far away do you need to be?
[12:52:07] <Sadale> Plus my custom case may block the wifi signal if it's installed inside the case.
[12:52:16] <theholyduck> Sadale: those cards dont have internal antennas
[12:52:19] <Sadale> Just a few meters. But there's door and shit in between
[12:52:22] <theholyduck> you hook up the antennas externally
[12:52:34] <Sadale> theholyduck, oh. There's no mounting hole for antenna for my computer case.
[12:52:43] <Sadale> I could drill one tho. But I'd need to learn.
[12:52:48] <theholyduck> learn how to drill?
[12:52:49] <theholyduck> ...
[12:52:50] <theholyduck> ......
[12:52:52] <theholyduck> .........
[12:52:59] <Sadale> It's acrylic case. I designed it.
[12:52:59] <RenAdjest> Or maybe try using ethernet cable.
[12:53:10] <Sadale> Nah. won't work. I have to move my computer from time to time
[12:53:52] <rando25892> at a point i had to rebuild the modules but on debian jessie my dongle works fine. i paid ten bucks for it.
[12:54:18] <Sadale> For now that best one that I've got is the edimax one. It has the best linux support.
[12:54:55] <Sadale> oh wait. nope. Just check. Mine isn't edimax. It's edup xD
[12:55:26] <theholyduck> i dunno if they even EXIST but you could go for AX gear if you can get a linux AX dongle
[12:55:30] <theholyduck> AX has better wall penetration
[12:55:31] <rando25892> or find the module for your brand and rebuild it
[12:55:56] <rando25892> quick and dirty
[12:56:01] <theholyduck> ofcourse you would need to upgrade your router to AX aswell
[12:56:01] <rando25892> back up before etc
[12:58:19] <Sadale> Ideally I'd want something in a form factor similar to TL-WN823N. It works perfectly on Windows with far enough distance.
[12:58:25] <Sadale> Too bad its linux support sucks :<
[12:58:45] <theholyduck> Sadale:  too bad linux suxx eh?
[12:58:45] <theholyduck> :D
[12:58:55] <Sadale> :/
[13:00:00] <Sadale> Some to think of it maybe it'd actually be a good idea for me to drill an external antenna hole onto the computer case. Those PCIe and M2 cards are known to be more reliable. Well, I need to think over it
[13:00:12] <Sadale> aww but I don't wanna disassemble the case xD
[13:00:16] <rando25892> ive purchase a big wifi dongle netgear 3.0 usb it makes a difference. it doesnt see much use cause only use to use it when i hermit in the library in public
[13:00:19] <theholyduck> you dont have a free pci-e slot on your motherboard to just use?

[13:00:34] <RenAdjest> Sadale: Wait, I thought TP Link wifi dongle are working out of the box in linux.
[13:00:44] <Sadale> theholyduck, I've got PCIe slot. But the computer case isn't tall enough to accomodate any PCIe cards.
[13:00:45] <theholyduck> RenAdjest:  might be a difference between working and working well
[13:00:52] <theholyduck> Sadale:  .... 
[13:00:56] <theholyduck> great design
[13:01:07] <theholyduck> not even room for using a  pci extender
[13:01:11] <theholyduck> to rotate the card 90 degrees?
[13:01:12] <Sadale> It's a computer case designed for my specific use. It's designed to be thin and it can fit into a reusable hand-carried bag.
[13:01:29] <Sadale> That's why I ask for USB dongle in the first place.
[13:01:30] <theholyduck> like what ppeople do to fit big gpus in small cases :P

[13:06:22] <Sadale> thanks amigojapan. I'd prefer to find a one that someone here had personally used tho
[13:06:35] <amigojapan> Ok
[13:06:45] <amigojapan> Good luck
[13:07:02] <rando25892> proprietary hardware is faster its true. 
[13:07:06] <rando25892> there is also openwifi
[13:07:52] <rando25892> its expensive af but im not sure they say if you involve in this its like the kernel making process its gonna blow in terms of usage in a presentation i watch yesterday
[13:10:58] <rando25892> there is also the official raspberry pi wifi dongle
[13:11:05] <rando25892> the wipi
[13:11:09] <rando25892> wiipi or something like that
[13:11:16] <rando25892> its kinda more expensive im not sure of the chipset
[13:13:51] <confact> Sadale: wen europe?
[13:14:00] <Sadale> confact, ?
[13:14:06] <Sadale> what's that?
[13:14:17] <confact> Sadale: when you go to europe?
[13:14:24] <Sadale> confact, expensive. no moneh :(
[13:14:30] <Sadale> rando25892, thanks. Will look into that :3
[13:14:50] <rando25892> you're welcome
[13:15:11] <Sadale> BTW, the PAU09 looks promising. Now I'm checking if there's any cheaper alternatives with the same chipset, preferable in smaller form factor
[13:15:35] *** Joins: name100 (~user@188.124.155.190)
[13:17:29] <theholyduck> smaller will mean worse wifi though
[13:17:32] <theholyduck> and worse range 
[13:17:41] <theholyduck> if you want distance and penetration bigger is better here
[13:18:31] <Sadale> Duh?
[13:18:41] <theholyduck> why do you want it in a smaller form factor though
[13:18:45] <theholyduck> if your problem is PENETRATION?
[13:18:51] <Sadale> save space.
[13:19:00] <theholyduck> its usb and detachable
[13:19:04] <theholyduck> just unplug it from the pc when in transit
[13:19:22] <Sadale> theholyduck, I just need good enough. Again the form factor of TL-WN823N is the perfect one. This one has good enough signal to me
[13:19:45] <theholyduck> also looks to me like the antenna is detachable. on the pau09 anyway
[13:19:49] <theholyduck> so you can take the antennas off when moving
[13:19:54] <theholyduck> for more compactness
[13:19:57] <Sadale> Even after it's detached it's still a bit too big
[13:20:00] <Sadale> too long.
[13:24:50] <Sadale> hmm. PAU05/06 looks promising as well. It doesn't have dual band. But it's more compact.

[14:14:24] <drunken_senti> fair enough
[14:14:38] <confact> Sadale: this is normal to think about. I did think so in the beginning too. Just read about it. I dont want you to go all in, 10% is ok.
[14:14:39] <drunken_senti> Can I talk to you about an hourly rate?
[14:14:49] <Sadale> confact, true.
[14:15:08] <Sadale> confact, maybe I'd invest like 5%. I definitely wouldn't want to invest what I don't wanna lose into BTC.
[14:15:32] <confact> Sadale: I will be ok with 100 usd in btc. To just see how it works.
[14:15:51] <Sadale> ah. I think I have more than that in holding. xD
[14:16:18] <Sadale> I couldn't remember. It's just more than 100USD. Maybe I've got like 300 USD. I really dunno.
[14:17:39] <amigojapan> confact: now is not a good time to buy BTC
[14:18:00] <amigojapan> Buy when low
[14:18:49] <confact> amigojapan: any time is good to buy something. It is better to focus on average bought price than try to catch low prices.
[14:19:18] <RenAdjest> I find it very stupid to goes all in in crypto. At least spread your risk by buying something else (like index funds)
[14:19:24] <amigojapan> confact: it's going to lose value soon
[14:19:59] <confact> RenAdjest: exactly. always think about the risks.
[14:20:51] <amigojapan> confact: pretty sure Nanobot would say not to buy now
[14:21:09] <confact> amigojapan: true, but it could gain value as well. no one knows. that's why better to buy a bit over a long period. so you get pretty good average price you bought on.
[14:23:33] <amigojapan> confact: BTC keeps on losing and gaining. It is obviously high now
[14:24:12] <amigojapan> Don't buy high. It is a basic thing in stocks. But low, sell high

[14:27:56] <rando25892> you dont want to be superman that's for sure
[14:29:16] <confact> amigojapan: my idea is that I will hold btc for years. And my thought is that BTC will be much higher in 5-10 years. With halving and all that. Famous traders and economics who will hold a long period will buy small pieces every week, month or year to get an average price - then you care less on high and lows.
[14:29:23] <amigojapan> confact: the fact that you are giving out bad business advice sounds to me like you want your own BTC to go up so you can sell higher

[15:09:29] <theholyduck> i dont see how the  bitcoin thing can last.
[15:09:37] <theholyduck> its not a useful currency and every day its gettin worse
[15:09:49] <theholyduck> it works for now because people keep buying into it
[15:10:00] <theholyduck> but its just a veichle for blind speculation
[15:10:52] <theholyduck> at SOME point. some regulation or SOMETHING is going to pop the tulip mania on it

[15:11:50] <Sadale> theholyduck, I suspect that'd be the case as well. Anyway the customer's always right. The only way to tell if BTC's gonna last is to wait and see.
[15:12:18] <Sadale> For this reason I'm not gonna invest too much into BTC. It's just too much risk to me
[15:12:31] <theholyduck> i mean i could be wrong ofcourse. im just saying. i dont think its a great method for saving for retirement. id rather put my money in a index fund and as long as the entire global economy doesnt stop  existing. it should still be making money

[15:27:22] <iloveyou> gold is for making things shiny
[15:27:45] <amigojapan> confact: the only way for bitcoins to gain value it for people to buy into it. So if you are lucky and can sell high. You a are just taking the money from other people that bought into it, and they are losing. If that implies a scam. Then I guess it is

[15:28:57] <amigojapan> iloveyou: there is fake gold too
[15:30:55] <amigojapan> The second season of re zero seems to just be repeating the same part from the first season. I have lost interest
[15:31:14] <iloveyou> real gold tends to look better
[15:31:22] <confact> amigojapan: yea. maybe. I do think btc do have some usage like value storage as companies like tesla and space x is doing. Stocks is little bit like this too. the value is based on how many people buying it will push the price up. But there people usually say stock is also connected to a company which btc isn't. But References to Gold or oil do make more sense in that sense, to compare with.

[18:49:19] <Cryowolf> but when it comes to movies and genres that take place in dystopian futures. I quite enjoy cyberpunk that comes with brainpunk.

[18:51:47] <Cryowolf> I wanna write a story on that. That the planet has been destroyed through wars and insurrection etc that when "cyberpunk" came along, things looked too shit.

[20:07:01] <Nanobot> That map shows it as a category 1, which is the weakest category. I don't know how common it is for New England to experience category 1 hurricanes.
[20:08:07] <amigojapan> No idea
[20:08:58] <Nanobot> Hurricanes are more an East Coast thing, so I don't know a lot about them.
[20:09:09] <amigojapan> Nanobot: in Japan, when typhoons hit. Most of the damage and death is caused by rivers overflowing cause of rain
[20:09:16] <Nanobot> I can tell you what it's like to breath wildfire smoke for over a month.
[20:09:28] <amigojapan> Right

[20:14:50] <amigojapan> Yo otouto yo
[20:15:34] <amigojapan> isekaijin: I watched all of re zero and liked it, eventho it is an isekai
[20:15:57] <amigojapan> It's similar to Eva
[20:16:34] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, you saw season 2 too?
[20:16:46] <amigojapan> Yes Cryowolf 
[20:16:58] <Cryowolf> so you watched all like 50 episodes so far?
[20:17:04] <isekaijin> I would watch anime (and do a lot more things, starting with work), but I am kind of addicted to a mobile gacha game, and have no time left outside of pulling gacha, praying I get what I want, and maybe eating and sleeping.
[20:17:14] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: yes, in 2 days
[20:17:17] <Cryowolf> nice
[20:17:37] <amigojapan> Ty
[20:17:51] <Cryowolf> you should give more isekai a chance I think, not everything is uberpowered protagonist owns everyone and gets a harem unchallenged
[20:17:56] <Cryowolf> even if I sometimes like that
[20:18:13] <amigojapan> isekaijin: I don't really get gatcha and that is probably for the better
[20:18:19] <Cryowolf> have you seen Konosuba? Dr Stone? (Dr Stone I argue is an Isekai)
[20:18:49] <amigojapan> Yes I watched both Cryowolf 
[20:18:57] <amigojapan> Recently
[20:19:27] <Cryowolf> What about Overlord? A lot of people I think miss the point of Overlord and dismiss it because the MC and his "group of minions" are all OP
[20:19:53] <amigojapan> No. I have not yet watched overlord
[20:19:58] <Cryowolf> It's about the protagonist being the villain of the story, the seemingly unbeatable force
[20:20:22] <amigojapan> I see
[20:20:24] <Cryowolf> because there's a lot of things he does that are really really evil
[20:20:42] <Cryowolf> it's about how he loses his humanity into his "character"
[20:20:49] <Cryowolf> loses his empathy and so on
[20:20:58] <Cryowolf> thats the story
[20:21:04] <amigojapan> Maybe I will watch that next
[20:21:46] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: slime was my least favourite isekai
[20:21:46] <Cryowolf> it still has isekai tropes. I mean he is basically an unbeatable force and few things challenge him and that can be fun to watch, but the most interesting thing is that he's not good
[20:22:04] <amigojapan> I see
[20:22:13] <Cryowolf> He can look at a group of humans and just think "these would be perfect experiments for that new flesh eating disease"
[20:22:30] <amigojapan> I see
[20:22:34] <Cryowolf> I like Slime. I would say Overlord is if Slime was evil ;D
[20:22:48] <amigojapan> Gotcha
[20:23:04] <amigojapan> I also did not like the spider isekai
[20:23:14] <Cryowolf> dont watch "How not to summon a demon lord" (it has a longer title)
[20:23:29] <amigojapan> Alright
[20:23:30] <Cryowolf> it's the very definition of what you hate about Isekai
[20:23:39] <Cryowolf> OP, Harem, no point in the story
[20:23:44] <Cryowolf> lots of ecchi
[20:23:58] <amigojapan> Gotcha, thanks for warning me
[20:24:16] <Cryowolf> same with the one that has Smartphone in the title, same with Isekai Cheat Magician
[20:24:40] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I think, just like school anime, they need to have something to offer

[20:25:05] <Sadale> I find ecchi funny tho

[20:27:03] <Cryowolf> it's a slow burn before it suddenly goes from 0 to 100 in an episode
[20:27:18] <amigojapan> Ok. I will key it up. The title sounds funny
[20:27:27] <Cryowolf> it's about how he grows up quite a lot, how he learns about the world and what it's like to be an adult in a childs body
[20:27:40] <Cryowolf> the way he thinks about things and what's actually appropriate
[20:27:51] <amigojapan> I see
[20:27:58] <Cryowolf> and the way he thinks like an adult about things but can't cdo that cause he's a child etc
[20:28:24] <Cryowolf> he is more powerful than regular people but that's more like "you have the potential, if you train"
[20:28:36] <Cryowolf> not "youre suddenly the most talented person on the planet"
[20:29:13] <amigojapan> I see
[20:29:42] <isekaijin> Sadale: One of the upsides of not getting along with my sisters is that they do not come near my computers (or near my bedroom, really). So I can have ecchi wallpapers if I want to. Not that I would stop having these wallpapers if they would peek.
[20:29:46] <Cryowolf> https://myanimelist.net/anime/36407/Kenja_no_Mago is also pretty good but it does follow the OP trope. I do like the idea of what makes him overpowered though. It's his idea of modern thinking in our era, science etc

[20:30:57] <Sadale> isekaijin, hahaha xD
[20:31:02] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, which one? Mushoku? Maybe yeah, but it has a deeper story and a lot of world building later on. It spends like 6-7 episodes establishing itself and the characters, having him grow up and so on.
[20:31:04] <isekaijin> Is there an easy way to share files between a mobile phone and a desktop computer?
[20:31:09] <Cryowolf> Starts with him as a child
[20:31:22] <isekaijin> Termux is cute, but actually using it is a fucking pain in the ass.
[20:31:32] <Cryowolf> isekaijin, most mobiles should have a setting that changes the usb connection from charging to storage
[20:31:38] <Sadale> isekaijin, nah I think I'm fine even if I set a ecchi wallpaper. She'd just be pissed off and she'd accuse me of being hentai xD

[20:34:52] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I think if you are going to classify all isekai anime for me, it will take a long time
[20:35:27] <Cryowolf> maybe, but there's a lot I've just forgotten about cause it wasn't good enough

[20:36:40] <Cryowolf> I don't mind that
[20:36:49] <Cryowolf> but Overlord is far from that. Overlord is dark
[20:36:49] <amigojapan> I mind that

[20:38:13] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: I hate sports
[20:38:18] <Cryowolf> well Konosuba makes fun of tropes so it does have to keep it light

[21:58:16] <ButterNoodle> yep is good
[21:58:36] <amigojapan> Yeah very good
[21:58:50] <ButterNoodle> I'd read the LNs so I dont have to wait on another season, but I dont wanna be one of those elitists
[21:59:02] <amigojapan> I think the second season was better, at least near the end
[21:59:07] <ButterNoodle> tru
[21:59:37] <ButterNoodle> there were a lot of things that were setup, even from S1 that were resolved
[21:59:50] <ButterNoodle> and it left more things to solve for in the future
[21:59:59] <ButterNoodle> very good world building, and history
[22:00:27] <ButterNoodle> u did watch the movie too?
[22:00:44] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: the only thing I did not like is that the battles seemed too long to me. Especially the whale hunt
[22:01:18] <amigojapan> No. I did not know there was a movie. Let me check
[22:01:20] <ButterNoodle> ik.. they hunted that whale for too many episodes, and the battle was over a few eps too iirrc
[22:01:39] <ButterNoodle> its call something snow.. its supposed to be before s2

[22:05:29] <amigojapan> treeman6: but there was no word for "anime"back then
[22:05:34] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: I dont think that slime is an exceptionally terrible anime, I think it just incorporates all of the things that are standard in isekais... which makes it boring

[22:06:03] <ButterNoodle> that wasnt a word until the late 80s tho
[22:06:18] <ButterNoodle> maybe after akira was a big hit in the us
[22:06:22] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: japanination is a 90s term
[22:06:51] <amigojapan> iloveyou: but Japan calls Popeye and Mickey mouse anime

[22:08:11] <iloveyou> maybe kingdom hearts is a mickey mouse isekai game
