[00:35:44] <Earnestly> Could be nicer if it didn't need to fork a bunch, but in principle as a '4GL' approach, is nice
[00:35:45] <greycat> why doesn't your perl solution handle NUL bytes?
[00:35:48] <tirnanog> always seems to be an objection.
[00:36:15] <tirnanog> greycat: it could in principle, but I'm being lazy and using -0 and -n there.

[01:04:45] <meator> Well you have answered my question. Thanks! I should really learn shell scripting some day. I can't get into my head that variables don't have types and the quoting hell.
[01:04:50] <greycat> you all know cmp is the best way
[01:04:54] <tirnanog> yep.

[01:05:13] <emanuele6> cmp is the best
[01:05:34] <tirnanog> the perl solution has the advantage of needing to be forked fewer times but the disadvantage of needing to read the entire file.

[01:05:52] <emanuele6> well, you don't have to read the entire file
[01:06:05] *** Joins: omnio (~omnio@user/omnio)
[01:06:16] <tirnanog> no, I don't. but I'm done fiddling with this problem space at this point.
[01:06:26] <tirnanog> the original suggestion was fine.
[01:07:05] <yustin> cat $file | if [ $(wc -l) -eq 1 ]; then grep -H "foobar" $file | cut -d: -f1 ; fi   :P~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[01:07:13] <tirnanog> emanuele6: if anything, it was more to demonstrate that perl has no issues dealing with arbtirary byte sequences.
[01:07:30] <Earnestly> I'd hope so
[01:07:41] <tirnanog> NUL isn't special at al, as far as string handling is concerned.
[01:09:13] <emanuele6> another alternative is jq
[01:10:07] <emanuele6> find -type f -exec jq -sR 'select(. == "something") | input_filename' {} \;
[01:10:29] <emanuele6> but that also has to read the entire file and (at least in this form) has to be run once per file
[01:10:41] <emanuele6> but at least it handles NUL and newlines correctly
[01:11:12] <emanuele6> ( i forgot -r )

[08:44:31] <znf> I recall it being an argument that init scripts would run faster with dash instead of bash, but now it seems like something antique :P
[08:44:38] <tirnanog> bash really is slow. but I think a more important argument would be that dash is a much smaller, conforming implementation of the Shell Command Language with a considerably smaller attack surface.
[08:46:02] <fluffywolf> bash forking is the biggest slowness I've found, and it really likes forking.
[08:46:35] <tirnanog> of course, debian being debian, decided to make it the standard sh(1) while sweeping all the compatibility issues under the carpet. not issues that can be attributed to any problem with dash but to all the morons (mostly in the linux world) that write bash scripts, while slapping #!/bin/sh at the top.
[08:47:00] <tirnanog> and by sweeping, I mean that they integrated some ridiculous patch that makes dash execute bash under certain circumstances.

[14:06:07] <Payam> in any situation
[14:06:17] <Payam> ah I got it
[14:06:37] <Soliton> if you want to expand $var and put bar after it...
[14:06:52] <Soliton> you can also write "$var"bar for example.
[14:06:57] <Payam> so if I have a variable called $VAR and another one called $VARBAR and if I do echo $VARBAR it would echo $VAR and not $VARBAR
[14:06:59] <Payam> right?
[14:07:17] <Soliton> yes.
[14:07:20] <Soliton> !caps
[14:07:20] <greybot> By convention, environment variables (PATH, EDITOR, SHELL, ...) and internal shell variables (BASH_VERSION, RANDOM, ...) are fully capitalized. All other variable names should be lowercase. Since variable names are case-sensitive, this convention avoids accidentally overriding environmental and internal variables. https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html
[14:07:21] <Payam> interesting

[16:35:38] <greybot> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/032 -- How can I redirect the output of 'time' to a variable or file?
[16:36:14] <rsjw> thanks, I already have it working to my satisfaction, I just didn't know why it was working the way it was. but apparently it's because using redirections inhibit bash's use of the time keyword

[16:56:40] <adac> Hi there! I'm trying to automaticall get hour and minute for my kubectl patch command and add one minute to the minutes. However it seems that this is not really working:

[16:58:00] <geirha> use jq to generate the json instead

[17:03:46] <greybot> eggbean: Parameter Expansion expands parameters: "$foo", "$1". You can use it to perform string or array operations: "${file%.mp3}", "${0##*/}", "${files[@]: -4}". They should *always* be quoted. See: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/073 and "Parameter Expansion" in man bash. Also see http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pe.

[17:13:33] <greybot> Either a comment, or in parameter expansion a count of something. ${#x} is the number of characters in $x. ${#x[@]} is the number of elements in the array 'x', and $# is the number of positional parameters.

[18:31:48] <x10an14> Any tips on where to go/how to debug missing tab-completions for pass extensions? I've come across https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/src/completion/pass.bash-completion#n128, and I notice that my NixOS/Home-manager system doesn't export the requisite `PASSWORD_STORE_EXTENSION_COMMANDS` env var.
[18:31:48] <x10an14> But even after setting it manually like so: `export PASSWORD_STORE_EXTENSION_COMMANDS=("otp" "update" "genphrase")`, I'm unable to get the extensions' (use `pass-otp` as reference/example, but valid for others too) options.
[18:31:48] <x10an14> Anyone got any hints/tips on how to debug/remedy this?
[18:32:29] <x10an14> Feels like it's something missing linking the `pass <extension name>` compgen with the related `share/bash-completions/completions/pass-<extension-name>`.
[18:32:38] <x10an14> If I source said file(s) manually it all works a-okay.
[18:34:33] <gnoo> x10an14: on guix, i don't get tab completion but M-<tab> (alt-tab) works sometimes
[18:34:48] <gnoo> (even for command arguments, not only for filenames)

[19:08:28] <x10an14> Soliton: Depends if you're going for readability or simplicity. Sometimes I'd say they're mutually exclusive^^ An argument could be made that read/IFS is still a bit outside a novice's comfort zone (they're still out of mine).
[19:08:36] <Earnestly> x10an14: There's a general rule in shell that if you have to invoke a tool, it's best to try and make the most of its capabilities

[19:14:52] <x10an14> Soliton: So you're saying that `complete` and `compgen` belong to the `bash-completion` package gnoo referenced earlier? Not to bash itself?

[19:16:46] <Soliton> you can put files whereever you want and bash will not care but bash-completion has some system for where it expects files to source.
[19:17:16] <Soliton> i doubt they have a system for command extensions though but who knows.

[19:18:02] <x10an14> I read on some S/E (or maybe it was S/O) post that compgen kinda struggled with spaces. Hence why I came here to ask.
[19:18:22] <x10an14> But thanks for the assist and answers so far! I'm gonna have to take another round at this I see
[19:18:22] <Soliton> how did spaces come into this?
[19:18:39] <x10an14> Soliton: `pass <extension name>` <--- Notice the space?
[19:19:12] <Soliton> how would that work with that extension function they expect?
[19:19:17] <x10an14> `pass o<tab tab>` -> `pass otp`, `pass otp -<tab tab>`.
[19:19:22] <Soliton> you certainly can't have spaces in a function name.

[19:20:00] <Soliton> if extensions can have spaces in their name that setup looks broken.
[19:20:18] <x10an14> It works for git, cargo, and others. So I dunno.
[19:20:38] <Soliton> (again that is all about how those completions are set up. zero to do with completion functions in bash in general.)
[19:20:51] <Soliton> why would it have ANYTHING to do with git or cargo?
[19:20:54] <x10an14> Aight, like I said, thanks for teaching me!
[19:21:40] <x10an14> Soliton: You get the same behaviour there? `git com<tab tab>` -> `git commit`, `git commit --am` -> `git commit --amend`?
[19:21:49] <Soliton> you showed a completion function for pass. unless the completion functions for those commands look similar there is no reason that they work the same in any way.
[19:23:24] <Soliton> does git even have subcommands with spaces?

[19:23:45] <Soliton> sounds like bad design anyway.
[19:24:34] <x10an14> I argue that `git commit` contains the same space I was referencing as in my `pass <extension name>`. So maybe this last merry-go-round is just down to another misunderstanding/talking past each other^^
[19:24:37] <Soliton> command line interfaces are based on words. if you allow spaces somewhere it's going to make things more complicated so there should be a very good reason.
[19:25:31] <Soliton> oh, so the space was between command and subcommand? there is no issue with that. why did you bring that up?
[19:26:45] <x10an14> I was trying to explain my rationale for coming here, trying to piece together why the completion works fine for `pass`, but not its extensions. Hence why I mentioned it, I thought there could be a connection.

[19:39:29] <gnoo> instead it is per-package.
[19:39:44] <Soliton> completion for pass in general works as i understood it.

[19:40:06] <gnoo> oh, that's nice, it doesn't for me, unfortunately
[19:40:12] <gnoo> so i guess i found my problem :P
[19:40:12] <Soliton> just nothing sources the files for the extension completion.
[19:40:16] <x10an14> But something makes it work for lots of other stuff (most likely replacing stuff like `BASH_COMPLETION_COMPAT_DIR`) to something like `/run/current-system/sw/share/bash-completion/completions/pass*`

[19:47:06] <x10an14> rendar: The man page specifies `--colors=always` I believe as a work-around, but "why" has more to do with something messed up/missing in your shell (dmesg thinks you don't have colors/you're piping its output)

[20:24:32] <spawnmc> would something like if [[ -f $file && $(find "$file" -mmin +120 -print  ]] work to check if a file both exists and is older than 120 minutes

[20:25:22] *** Parts: silly (silly@user/silly) (Leaving)
[20:25:32] <Soliton> lazy loading all extensions starting with s on "pass s<tab>" is not reasonable and not how the existing autoloading works either.
[20:25:47] <x10an14> spawnmc: You can combine the two clauses with `find`'s `-type f` parameter

[20:28:35] <x10an14> Soliton: I thought that's how it did work, but I guess I've misunderstood. I use `pas<tab tab>`to finish `pass`, and then I would've liked `pass <tab tab>` to also list the potentially installed extensions.

[22:35:09] <OnlineCop> I've got several grep aliases to help recursively search within specific files for patterns. Most of the time, I want to show the line numbers for the results (especially so vscode can jump to that file+line), so I have the `grep -n` flag set. However, I'd like for `-n` to not be set when I will pipe this result somewhere (like for `xargs`). Is there a way to dynamically apply (or not) this `-n` flag?
[22:35:46] <greycat> Replace the aliases with functions.  Then, you can use test -t 1 (or equivalent) inside the function, dynamically construct the arg list, etc.
[22:36:08] <OnlineCop> Is `test -t 1` a test for a pipe redirection?
[22:36:14] <greycat> !isatty
[22:36:14] <greybot> You can see whether a file descriptor is open on a terminal with test -t. Many programs perform a check like this and change their behavior: ls, GNU grep, git, systemctl, etc.
