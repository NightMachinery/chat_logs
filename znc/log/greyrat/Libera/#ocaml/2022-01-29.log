[01:49:08] <d_bot> <octachron> OCaml 5.0 is currently a development version on the compiler repository, we are still month(s) away from a *first alpha release*. There is simply no support for ocaml-lsp-server on OCaml 5.0 yet.
[01:49:09] <d_bot> <octachron> (even if updating tools from 4.14 to 5.0 should be relatively swift since there is no AST differences between the two versions).
[01:50:04] <d_bot> <NULL> What's preventing the current version to work (at least experimentally) on the trunk version ?
[01:58:26] <d_bot> <octachron> Time?
[01:58:26] <d_bot> <octachron> The current version of Merlin generally cannot work on trunk.
[01:58:28] <d_bot> <octachron> There was still major work on updating Merlin for 4.14 last week.
[02:02:30] <d_bot> <NULL> What's the technical version why merlin for 4.14 couldn't work without modification on 5.0/trunk code ?
[02:02:44] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@2806:101e:7:6bed:7c68:228:b173:b6f7)
[02:06:25] <d_bot> <octachron> There is no way that Merlin for 4.13 could work on trunk. Merlin use the internal typechecker API (a fact a fork of this API) which is not stable at all . Trying to use a previous version of Merlin on trunk is nearly certain to fail.
[02:07:32] <d_bot> <octachron> It happens that for the twin 4.14/5.0 releases, the 4.14 version of Merlin should work on 5.0; but that still requires work to check that this is indeed completely the case.

[18:48:48] <dmbaturin> Interesting. I guess actual compilation error is needed then. Try adding `--verbose` to the command, that may display the error it hides by default (though I wish it didn't hide it to begin with).

[19:01:43] <d_bot> <NULL> How did you install opam?
[19:03:41] <d_bot> <crab Î»> `sh <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh)`
[19:04:19] <d_bot> <NULL> You need to manually take care of the dependencies if you do it like this
[19:04:38] <d_bot> <NULL> A solution is to install it through APT
[19:05:27] <d_bot> <NULL> The installer should have put the executable in a place that takes priority over where apt will install its own, so this shouldn't change much
[19:05:34] <d_bot> <crab Î»> i got all the dependencies
[19:05:38] <d_bot> <crab Î»> for opam init
[19:05:50] <d_bot> <crab Î»> i didnt use an installert
[19:06:25] <d_bot> <NULL> A C toolchain is required for ocaml (as explained in the error message) and you don't have any
[19:06:49] <d_bot> <NULL> Your command is an installer (install.sh)
[19:12:19] <d_bot> <crab Î»> i have llvm
[19:12:24] <d_bot> <crab Î»> and cmake
[19:13:24] *** Joins: bartholin (~bartholin@109.53.3.123)
[19:13:43] <dmbaturin> But the build script needs GCC and GNU make.
[19:14:25] <d_bot> <NULL> cc isn't even defined
[19:15:12] <d_bot> <NULL> Really, the easiest painless solution is `sudo apt install opam`
[19:15:59] <dmbaturin> One problem with installing from the repos is that Debian people have ocaml in opam's dependencies, for reasons that escape me.
[19:16:28] <dmbaturin> So you end up with a non-removable installation of compiler older than you'd want to use. Maybe Ubuntu maintainers fixed that at least.
[19:16:46] <d_bot> <NULL> Is that a problem?
[19:17:14] <dmbaturin> Well, it's an annoyance for sure.
[19:18:22] <d_bot> <NULL> Not having a system compiler would be weird I think
[19:18:27] <dmbaturin> For newbies who don't know how to install dependencies by hand, it's an acceptable compromise I suppose.
[19:19:20] <dmbaturin> Well, in Ubuntu, _maybe_. In Debian the system compiler is always a fossil by the time they release a new distro version.
[19:37:58] <d_bot> <monk> yeah i would argue always go with an installer/setup that is, by the first degree, independent of a system's package manager when possible
[19:38:06] <d_bot> <monk> even with arch i try to do that
[19:38:46] <d_bot> <crab Î»> ok
[19:38:47] <d_bot> <monk> but for newer people that does mean getting lost in not knowing what common dependencies a PL might need to install, like gcc or lib ssl or whatever, you know
[19:39:45] <d_bot> <monk> admittedly this is what good install README/web page will have enumerated for most systems when possible to maintain
[19:41:06] <OCamlPro[m]> <lÃ©o> You can just `sudo apt install --no-recommends opam` and it won't install ocaml with opam...

[19:47:13] <mclovin> But I have no idea about what your issue is. I was just replying to dmbaturin about having  a "non-removable installation of compiler".
[19:48:07] <dmbaturin> mclovin: At some point it was in Depends: rather than in Recommends: AFAIR, though my memory can be wrong. If it's now in Recommends:, that's good though.
[19:51:21] <mclovin> It seems it never was: https://salsa.debian.org/ocaml-team/opam/-/commit/2dacbfe6b98d87f3c4f8f51b356970d3d8e03401

[19:54:01] <d_bot> <crab Î»> its working
[19:54:46] <d_bot> <NULL> ocaml is also recommended for Ubuntu's opam

[19:55:33] <mclovin> You have to create a switch with opam now.
[19:55:49] <d_bot> <NULL> `opam switch create 4.13.1`
[19:56:08] <mclovin> something like: `opam update && opam switch create 4.13.1 && eval $(opam env)`
[19:56:27] <d_bot> <NULL> Make sure you are using the latest version of opam, not the one you just installed (`which opam` should return `/usr/local/bin` I think)
[19:57:10] <mclovin> rather `/usr/bin/opam`, no ?

[19:58:08] <d_bot> <NULL> I meant `/usr/local/bin/opam`, `/usr/bin/opam` would be where Ubuntu installed its own (which is older than the one the installer got)
