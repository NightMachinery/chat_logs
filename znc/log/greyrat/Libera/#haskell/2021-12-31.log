[01:16:22] <qrpnxz> yeah pretty low level for the overwrite case
[01:17:23] <qrpnxz> and i'd like to build some of the structures by hand as well, what's idiomatic serialization in Haskell? Should I use Show or is there something more "efficient"?

[01:18:14] <dsal> But it depends on the structure.  I did mqtt "by hand" with a class that's I probably named "ByteMe" or something which makes a ByteStream out of a thing.
[01:18:57] <qrpnxz> yeah, something like that was the plan if there wasn't anything else
[01:19:10] <geekosaur> depends on how you want to serialize stuff. there are libraries for things like protobuf, json, yaml, bson, toml, etc.; there are libraries for Haskell-specific serialization with type information (binary, cereal), etc.
[01:19:35] <dsal> If you want to encode your data into mqtt packets, I've got something that will do that.
[01:19:35] <geekosaur> if you need to serialize for direct consumption by C/FFI, there's the Storable class

[01:39:21] <glguy> dignissimus: I'd switch to using derived Eq instances when you can, and not providing Eq instances when they are incomplete
[01:39:44] <glguy> In some cases with GADTs you can derive them using StandaloneDeriving when you couldn't have derived them the normal way

[01:43:16] <glguy> in the case of your file, it's not needed
[01:43:40] <glguy> (you aren't using any GADTs)
[01:44:16] <geekosaur> it's sometimes useful when you need an instance that the original author didn't derive for you, but only in executables (otherwise, well, orphan instances are a nasty trap for the unsuspecting)
[01:44:41] <geekosaur> and otherwise useful because they can derive things for GADTs when normal deriving can't, as glguy said

[01:50:06] <geekosaur> right, I'm mostly thinking of the GADTs that hide existentials that can never be proven Eq
[01:50:25] <dignissimus> glguy: With GADTs, I initially used the GADT pragma because I wanted to encode type information expression with the `Expression` type, I then realised I couldn't do this. Now, if I remove the GADT pragma, I'm told SimpleType is an illegal GADT declaration, how come? (I can't tell why it can't be done without the extension)

[04:35:13] <iphy> I have the following ADT with lists in the constructors: https://github.com/TokTok/hs-cimple/blob/master/src/Language/Cimple/Ast.hs#L52
[04:35:13] <iphy> is there a way to define a catamorphism that considers lists a recursive type, so I can define a list element's result in terms of  the next element's result?
[04:36:05] <iphy> I'm thinking about how to compute the live set for each statement, i.e. which variables are alive (= will be referenced in the future) at any point in the program

[15:23:48] <dignissimus> I think I've been able to write this type theory proof out in haskell https://paste.tomsmeding.com/OnkdykS9 https://i.imgur.com/YU6cJJF.png
[15:25:01] <dignissimus> When I ran the code I was expecting everything to blow up but haskell's type system is too good to allow me to make terrible mistakes
[15:25:25] <jtomas> Hi, looking at the beggining of the page: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/, why does 25th december release has a lower version (9.0.2) than the 29th october release (9.2.1)?
[15:25:49] <geekosaur> because M1 Macs made a mess of things
[15:26:09] <int-e> it's a maintenance release for the ghc 9.0 major version
[15:26:14] <geekosaur> we also had an even earlier slew of releases (8.10.5 through 8.10.7) after 9.0.1
[15:27:07] <geekosaur> basically: 9.0.1 included linear types. 8.10.5-8.10.7 were M1 Mac support via LLVM. 9.2.1 was native asm support for M1 Macs, but that turned out to be broken and a fix is expected mid-January
[15:27:25] <int-e> because people generally don't switch to the latest ghc immediately; the major releases tend to break libraries and it takes a while for them to catch up.
[15:27:36] <geekosaur> this has caused lots of messes including with ghc development and maintenance, and I think they're going to try really hard to not repeat this in the future
[15:27:52] <int-e> even 8.10 isn't dead yet (and I wouldn't be surprised if it was still more popular than 9.0, but  don't know)
[15:28:14] <geekosaur> it is, if only because stack lts releases are still 8.10.7

[15:29:20] <geekosaur> 9.0.1 has enough bugs that pretty much the only people using it are the ones who need linear types
[15:29:37] <geekosaur> also much of the ecosystem hasn't caught up to either 9.x release yet
[15:30:27] *** Joins: FinnElija (~finn_elij@user/finn-elija/x-0085643)
[15:34:40] <c_wraith> yeah, 9.0.1 had a *lot* of bugs that were fixed in 9.2.  I doubt a lot of those fixes were backported.
[15:35:04] <c_wraith> so neither 9.x branch is especially attractive for real-world use right now

[15:59:09] <int-e> Oh pattern synonyms add a fun corner case: import Bar (x); data Foo = Foo { foo: Int }; pattern Bar = Foo{ foo = 42 }  ... what does Bar.x mean?
[15:59:27] <int-e> uh, x and foo were suposed to be the same identifier
[16:00:25] <geekosaur> I thought that was still considered an open issue with OverloadedRecordDot. I know there are several corner cases they punted to see how the ecosystem was affected
[16:01:02] <int-e> I missed the development, so the above is me playing catch-up :)

[16:09:00] <jtomas> The example in the motivation section (https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0282-record-dot-syntax.rst#1-motivation) throws an error: "multiple declarations on name". Is this solvable with some other pragma or does the actual implemention in 9.2.1 simply does not support this?
[16:10:37] *** Quits: wroathe (~wroathe@user/wroathe) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[16:11:04] <geekosaur> I believe OverloadedRecordDot is only part of the solution, solving the problem that it's impossible to have more than one b in scope for `b a` to work. The rest is https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/hasfield.html so you can actually have more than one defined
[16:11:27] *** Joins: xkuru (~xkuru@user/xkuru)
[16:12:01] <geekosaur> which is itself not enough to solve `b a` because `b` is a function and you can only have one such function in scope
[16:12:43] <geekosaur> and defining `Has` constraints still leaves declaring a suitable `b` somewhere, usually via Template Haskell
