[00:02:44] <hide> I've implemented a check as part of an lspconfig on_new_config function, when using yamlls, to check the files contents and set the yamlls, yaml schema to the appropriate schema for the file. One issue I'm having is that only the first buffer is executing the on_new_config, the second issue is I'm not sure this is the right way to do this.
[00:04:52] <mjlbach[m]> Why do you not just set the schema with a restrictive regex or via modeline?
[00:04:55] <mjlbach[m]> not regex, glob I guess
[00:05:11] <mjlbach[m]> You can add multiple match patterns
[00:09:00] <hide> I have many files that are yaml, all with different schemas, I am not the only person that works on them so adding a modeline is not an option 
[00:09:47] *** Joins: rsaavedra (~rodrigo@user/rsaavedra)
[00:13:03] <mjlbach[m]> Ok, the former option then :) 
[00:13:20] <mjlbach[m]> You can set as many glob patterns as you want when you override settings in on_new_config
[00:13:36] <hide> would that not require changing the name of the files?
[00:13:52] <hide> perhaps I'm missing what these glob patters actually are.
[00:13:57] <mjlbach[m]> no?
[00:14:36] <hide> the example I was looking at for setting kubernetes used the glob `/*.yaml`
[00:14:39] * mjlbach[m] sent a lua code block: https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/43d8ef7a5d42ef9832b1b8b4c595e4a3b13addee
[00:14:43] <mjlbach[m]> Like that
[00:14:51] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah I wrote that example haha

[00:15:51] <hide> Good to know I was looking in the right spot :D
[00:16:20] <hide> so I'd use the full path name for the buffer in the schema definition 
[00:16:55] <mjlbach[m]> You can also use a glob pattern for the intermediate path (the to) and just match on filename
[00:17:26] <mjlbach[m]> I think the root `/` is relative to the rootPath sent to yamlls, not absolute
[00:17:58] <hide> I did read that somewhere. I will give it a try.

[02:01:42] <gadkadoshgadkado> hi @atrius:matrix.org, I wonder if you could help me clarify something strange I've noticed. I know null-ls is not part of lspconfig, but it registers itself using it. However, I discovered that if I configure null-ls (require'null-ls'.config(...)) without also require'lspconfig'['null-ls'].setup(...) all of the other lspconig'ed servers break. That doesn't seem like correct behavior to me, but maybe I'm missing something?
[02:05:56] <mjlbach[m]> What
[02:06:30] <mjlbach[m]> That seems problematic
[02:06:39] <mjlbach[m]> Configs is just a table fwiw
[02:06:49] <mjlbach[m]> What does break mean
[02:07:07] <gadkadoshgadkado> It's rather related to the rpc
[02:08:00] <mjlbach[m]> I thought there were several fixes in null-ls around how it calls lspconfig today
[02:08:11] <mjlbach[m]> What does related to rpc mean? Is there an error message?
[02:08:15] <mjlbach[m]> OH
[02:08:17] <gadkadoshgadkado> I'm still trying to understand how it works.
[02:08:19] <mjlbach[m]> I have an idea
[02:08:59] <mjlbach[m]> Idk, do they globally override the vim.lsp.rpc table or something temporarily and then set it back?
[02:09:34] <gadkadoshgadkado> Those fixes are what led me to look into how it works. In fact, I realized I had a mistake in my config, for one server I didn't load stuff, and it still worked. that threw me off on this tangent.
[02:10:21] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah I have not ever looked at the internals for null-ls until today
[02:10:26] <gadkadoshgadkado> yes, i think that's more or less what they do. But then how come other servers can get loaded in between and will work fine afterwards
[02:10:58] <mjlbach[m]> Maybe because the autocommand is lazy?
[02:11:07] <mjlbach[m]> Setup doesn’t start anything directly

[04:14:10] <neverwas> I guess I was mainly interested in whether there were any broader (perhaps informal) efforts underway to standardize those text objects and structural-editing/nav bindings so that, for example, we might one day see this stuff take hold in vim-itation plugins for vscode and intellij (or whatever). Sort of like how some have adopted the surround stuff.

[15:11:32] <dundargoc> How?
[15:11:34] <dundargoc> Why?
[15:12:00] <muniter[m]> Well in regex a `.` matches any token

[15:16:08] <muniter[m]> Well if I remember correctly the `&` is used to match both sides in the same string. In this case the first is `forever` which matches and the second is `...` which also matches the 3 first characters of `forever`

[15:17:01] <dundargoc> lmao wat. so you combine regexes?
[15:17:19] <muniter[m]> In the case of `fortuin` the first part `forever` doesn't match, and the second part `...` does match. 
[15:18:23] <muniter[m]> Yeah, that's the idea of `&` both sides need to match. Unlike `|` when only one sides need to match. First time I see the pneumonic `&& and ||` from if or
[15:18:57] <muniter[m]> dundargoc: Why have simple regex when you can combine them. 
[15:19:18] <muniter[m]> Lol perfect moment to look at dundargoc  profile picture. So wholesome
[15:19:21] <dundargoc> OK, but this is ambiguous because `for` isn't the only thing that matches. Any three consectuive characters in `forever` matches.

[15:20:06] <muniter[m]> I'm not sure, i believe the march has to start at the same place. Meaning the `...` needs to star at the `f`

[15:35:04] <theh> <sunjonSenghanBri> "any time you saved by reloading..." <- If I was just using a theme then yes, but I'm working on my own theme so instant refresh is vital. And that worked until a few days ago.
[15:35:48] <clason[m]> and your scheme is not just some flat `colors/foo.vim`?
[15:37:06] <theh> Lua file, but with some substructure, e.g. colors are in their own file for reuse.
[15:38:00] <clason[m]> should make no difference
[15:38:09] <clason[m]> unless you `require`
[15:38:17] <clason[m]> (which you don't need to)
[15:38:27] <clason[m]> (or really should, in this case)
[15:39:59] <theh> There is one require unfortunately. Isn't that vital for making the theme cacheable/fast?
[15:40:26] <clason[m]> no, why?
[15:41:18] <clason[m]> (cacheable, yes -- as you just noticed to your detriment. fast, no)
[15:43:22] <theh> Ok, I'll give it a try without and see how fast that is. In classic vim, proper large themes tend to be the slowest component to load during vim startup, and it's not the unavoidable `highlight` calls.
[15:43:44] <clason[m]> then the themes are too large :)
[15:44:02] <clason[m]> and do unnecessary things at runtime
[15:44:19] <theh> That's on the vim ecosystem (imo), too much doesn't look good without tons of custom tweaking.
[15:44:49] <clason[m]> and I don't see how a cache would help there -- in a normal situation, you only load your colorscheme once...
[15:44:55] <theh> E.g. plugins don't have common groups to refer to, such a gutter symbol colors.

[15:46:05] <theh> Yeah, if caching doesn't matter I'll try that. I simply noticed that Lua themes doing the same work load way faster than VimScript ones and assumed it was the caching, maybe it's just Lua then.
[15:46:20] <clason[m]> But if you're concerned about that, create your own colorscheme using just the groups your plugins use (as you are doing, it seems).
[15:46:44] *** X-Scale` is now known as X-Scale
[15:47:18] <clason[m]> Depends on what they are doing. I'd say if they're truly identical except for the language, there should be no difference (if they're just defining colors and setting highlight groups).

[15:50:36] <theh> Not my observation, unless these startup benchmark plugins are mismeasuring this (e.g. 50ms vs 5ms). Anyway, will rerun and see if I worked on false assumptions there.
[15:51:55] <clason[m]> for me the difference between equivalent schemes is 2ms vs. 1.7ms

[16:08:45] <dagle> How do I get a basename of a path?
[16:23:15] <theh> clason: Do you happen to know why statusline plugins tend to define their colors externally, rather than via highlight groups? This always requires extra plumbing compared to most other plugins. Even tab/buffer bars tend to use highlight groups.
[16:24:28] <theh> I wonder if it's how a popular one did it early on an all others then imitated that, or if there's a functional reason they are different in this regard.
[16:25:04] <clason[m]> I do define my statusline colors as highlight groups in my color scheme...
[16:25:51] <theh> Do you use the native vim one? I'm thinking Airline, Lightline, lualine. Haven't looked at the other new nvim ones yet.
[16:26:00] <clason[m]> lualine is nvim-only
[16:26:08] <clason[m]> (and the one I use)
[16:26:15] <clason[m]> as the name implies ;)
[16:26:33] *** Joins: yeirr (~yeirr@user/yeirr)
[16:27:28] <theh> Yes, but it doesn't rely on highlight groups does it? Its themes are lua structs, unless I'm missing something.
[16:27:57] <clason[m]> I don't know the reason for the old ones; could have been historical (only few, basic, color schemes were around, so plugins couldn't assume support and hence rolled their own), but also a matter of startup sequencing (although `:colorscheme` in your `init.vim` should come first, so I don't see an issue)
[16:28:14] <clason[m]> yes, but you can pass that table to `setup`
[16:28:28] <MrElendig> dagle: expand() ?
[16:28:33] <clason[m]> and use pre-defined highlight groups there
[16:28:39] <dagle> MrElendig: That is for current file and not a path.
[16:28:50] <clason[m]> like so: https://gist.github.com/clason/5a8f57d81525d015ef1abfb276a78974
[16:30:09] <theh> Ah OK, that's nice. Not suited for a shared colorscheme, but certainly or personal use.
[16:30:18] <theh> s/or/for/
[16:30:32] <clason[m]> I think the reason is that some colors are auto-setup if not specified (and maybe even auto-computed)
[16:31:25] <clason[m]> but, yeah, it'd a perfectly valid approach for a statusline plugin to just say "these are the highlight groups I use to color the segments; make sure they are defined to your liking"
[16:32:15] <clason[m]> theh: yeah, one of the things that sold me on lualine. I found the mucking about with separate themes tedious as well.
[16:34:49] <theh> I like it too. Seemed like the natural successor to lightline, which I used before nvim 0.5.

[19:56:04] <clason[m]> isn't that something that the server repo/docs should make clear?
[19:56:21] <mjlbach[m]> maybe but this happens ~once a month

[23:16:46] <luisiaccLuisCC[m> is the pyright issue(delay when writing and then quickly going to definition) going to get fixed by 0.6 release?
[23:17:01] <luisiaccLuisCC[m> or is it a plugin related issue and not a neovim related issue?
[23:17:15] <luisiaccLuisCC[m> * a neovim(core) related
[23:20:57] <mjlbach[m]> luisiaccLuisCC[m: No, it also won’t be fixed unless someone provides a repro sans nvim-cmp
[23:21:43] *** Joins: thanksbud (~225m@user/thanksbud)
[23:22:52] <luisiaccLuisCC[m> Got it, I'll try to make one
[23:23:48] <kylo252[m]> <mjlbach[m]> "So I assume it works generally" <- installing through `fnm` also uses `npm.cmd`
[23:23:48] <kylo252[m]> I'm starting to think it's something to do with symlinks
[23:24:22] <mjlbach[m]> Npm.cmd isn’t the issue
[23:24:31] <mjlbach[m]> It’s postfixing the script entry points no?
[23:24:46] <kylo252[m]> `npm.cmd` will always install `tsserver.cmd` 
[23:25:11] <kylo252[m]> it's only volta that is providing `npm.exe` and subsequently `tsserver.exe`

[23:26:01] <kylo252[m]> is there a native `which` command in vim? I guess we can parse the path to see if it's  produced/owned by `volta` and then skip adding the postfix 
[23:26:47] <kylo252[m]> `os.execute("which tsserver")` actually breaks neovim
[23:31:11] <aphysically> is there a simple way to get the current lua value of a field here so I can make a toggle
[23:31:13] <aphysically> nnoremap <silent> <leader>tc :lua require('cmp').setup.buffer { enabled = not require('cmp').setup.buffer.enabled }<CR>
[23:31:19] <aphysically> I want to do something like this
[23:31:32] <aphysically> that doesn't work because I can't access the buffer enabled field like that
[23:33:36] <kylo252[m]> aphysically: what kind of file is it? you can use either ftplugin or make use of the language-server `on_attach` function
[23:33:59] <aphysically> I don't want to set it for a specific file I want to bind something to enable and disable it
[23:36:49] <kylo252[m]> what happens if you just make a `disable` mapping?
[23:37:18] <aphysically> then it's not a toggle mapping?
[23:37:23] <aphysically> I can make a disable mapping fine, it's:
[23:37:25] <aphysically> nnoremap <silent> <leader>dc :lua require('cmp').setup.buffer { enabled = false }<CR>
[23:37:30] *** Joins: velgin_ (~velgin@pool-96-237-105-119.bstnma.fios.verizon.net)
[23:37:57] <aphysically> I'm just trying to figure out if there's a way to access the current value of enabled so I don't have to make an entire function and global variable to store the current enabled state just to make a toggle mapping
[23:37:58] <kylo252[m]> so you can manage the state externally 
[23:38:14] <kylo252[m]> but I'm pretty sure that `cmp` has an info API that would work for this
[23:38:36] <kylo252[m]> it's should be the same one used in `CmpStatus` 
[23:38:51] <aphysically> I don't really know lua is buffer some kind of object that's private and state can't be accessed? (only set/overriden?)
[23:39:02] <aphysically> and therefore it can only be accessed by some separate API?

[23:41:27] <kylo252[m]> https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp/blob/092fb66b6ddb4b12b9b542d105d7af40e4fbd9f2/lua/cmp/init.lua#L198
[23:41:45] <aphysically> right now I get E5108: Error executing lua [string ":lua"]:1: attempt to index field 'buffer' (a function value)
[23:42:00] <aphysically> for trying to do "setup.buffer.enabled"
[23:42:31] <aphysically> same with setup.buffer.enabled()
[23:42:58] <kylo252[m]> the dumbest way would be to just iterate through the sources list, like in the function I just linked and then see if `buffer` is loaded/available or not
[23:44:04] <aphysically> I don't understand, is buffer { enabled = false } a function call?
[23:44:28] <clason[m]> yes, of course
[23:45:24] <aphysically> my 5 minute lua crash course led me to believe you only use () for function calls in lua but I guess it has alternate syntaxes
[23:45:29] <kylo252[m]> try this... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/2f13366d6acfdaa7897c9d2045f1c998989016fc)
[23:45:48] <clason[m]> aphysically: should have kept reading ;)
[23:46:26] <clason[m]> Lua has (too much) syntactic sugar; in this case: you can omit parentheses around function arguments that are a single table or string literal
[23:47:00] <clason[m]> so `foo('bar') == foo 'bar'` and `foo({bar = baz}) == foo {bar = baz}`
[23:47:21] <clason[m]> (people like the latter because it makes it look like keyword arguments, which Lua doesn't support)
[23:48:09] <clason[m]> (and the former allows doing something like `u'foo'` for a function `u()` that does string normalization or somesuch)
[23:48:09] <aphysically> I see
[23:53:05] <d34df00d> bfredl: yep, that's a remote (RPC) plugin.
[23:53:42] <d34df00d> Yay, nvim_call_atomic is very much what I need.
[23:53:54] <d34df00d> I tried googling for something that'd allow batching requests, but didn't find this one. Thanks!
