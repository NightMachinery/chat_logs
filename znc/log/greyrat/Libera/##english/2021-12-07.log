[18:26:20] <TimMc> Klinda: senior
[18:26:36] <TimMc> But you can never guarantee not offending someone if you're talking about their age. :-)
[18:26:45] <twb> When I was 32 and a woman was crossing the road next to me and hurt her leg, and I was helping her, I was not sure if calling her "sister" or "aunty" was less rude.  She looked about 38 years old.
[18:26:55] <twb> TimMc: that's a reasonable answer
[18:28:10] <TimMc> "Senior" would not be a form of address, to be clear.
[18:28:22] <TimMc> Should be fine for a variable name, though!
[18:28:35] <twb> unless you're translating a Japanese bildungsroman :-)
[18:28:49] <TimMc> hah, yeah?

[18:29:13] <twb> American translators often change that to "senior"
[18:29:25] <TimMc> Interesting.
[18:29:28] <twb> There's no direct cultural equivalent
[18:29:37] <twb> closest would be like mentor/protege
[18:30:03] <TimMc> ah
[18:30:11] <TimMc> "Senior" can refer to either age or rank.
[18:30:16] <Klinda> Well my project has to be corrected by a teacher who is > 66, I think... so do you think senior is enough ?
[18:30:49] <TimMc> hahaha
[18:31:33] <twb> definitely none of these mean exactly "born over 66 years ago"
[18:31:52] <Klinda> well that variable should set if the age is that, it's a subsidy value..
[18:33:16] <Klinda> if age > 33 that then subsidy = 
[18:33:20] <Klinda> 66*
[18:33:25] <TimMc> Maybe go with "wise_and_mature" if you want to flatter your teacher. :-P
[18:33:31] <Klinda> ahahahah
[18:34:40] <TimMc> "Senior" should be fine. It's older than "middle-aged", and doesn't quite have the connotations of frailty that "elderly" often does, and it's often used in bureaucratic contexts.

[18:51:52] <bin> yeah I have seen some numbers that are specifically for life expectancy that don't include infant mortality (usually phrased as something like 'adult life expectancy') but I haven't seen ones that were under 65. I was just curious because that just feels young to me. That Australian link is really interesting, I'm going to read more of it now. Thank you! 
[18:53:03] <bin> But just because I hadn't seen one for ages under 65 doesn't mean it doesn't exist, to be clear. I'm not pretending to be the end-all of knowledge on this topic lol
[18:53:05] <bin> Just to clarify 
[18:56:55] <TimMc> "Life expectancy at 10 years" is one I've seen.

[22:17:37] <twb> jemius: it's understandable, but "far fewer" works better
[22:18:14] <jemius> twb, but is it correct English? It is not my phrase. I am just curious, as it comes from someone born in the UK
[22:18:37] <twb> No
[22:18:57] <twb> It MIGHT be correct for informal usage
[22:19:05] <twb> definitely not for formal writing
