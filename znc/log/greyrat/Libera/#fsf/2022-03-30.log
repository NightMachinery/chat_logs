[01:00:15] <coralgoat> isf-, thanks for that link. Yes a mini PCI express wifi card like that.
[01:01:00] <coralgoat> https://www.thinkpenguin.com/gnu-linux/wireless-n-pci-express-dual-band-mini-half-height-card-w-full-height-bracket-option-tpe-nh says the chipset is Atheros AR9280.
[01:01:42] <coralgoat> That appears to match https://h-node.org/wifi/view/en/116/Atheros-Communications-Inc--AR928X-Wireless-Network-Adapter--PCI-Express---rev-01-/1/1/undef/undef/yes/mini-PCI-E/wifi-works/undef

[10:13:46] *** Joins: m4t3 (~Matoko@105.160.57.50)
[10:13:54] <Andrew> alsso, 挺 is u+633A, the sqrt of that is irrational
[10:14:03] <qrpnxz> GNOME on fedora, looks like i can just select it in keyboard menu? Which system do you recommend? (which do you use?)
[10:14:05] <Andrew> So I guess it is \sqrt{挺} :P
[10:14:39] <Andrew> qrpnxz: I use (1) Gentoo-libre (2) Parabola (3) OPENBSD!!! (4) mezzano, I just use fcitx with fcitx-sunpinyin, seems to be the smartest pinyin out there
[10:14:43] <qrpnxz> i have this option https://a.tmp.ninja/smMozBee.png
[10:14:45] <kompowiec2> 14 * 17 = 238 cases for every F single word, some are repeated, some do not exist.
[10:14:51] <qrpnxz> i see

[10:17:48] <qrpnxz> i was kinda hoping for a boponofo option lol
[10:17:54] <qrpnxz> but maybe that crazy
[10:18:01] <Andrew> I'm learning Shuangpin, basically stenography but Chinese
[10:19:16] <Andrew> qrpnxz: Fedora is quite innovative those days
[10:19:33] <Andrew> Kinda like Ubuntu back in the old days, but Fedora is free-by-default, so is Debian
[10:20:16] <qrpnxz> i like rpm

[11:43:30] <Andrew> Though I don't get why they do so

[16:19:24] <fossdev2> kompowiec2: sorry but i don't understand the problem
[16:21:11] <fossdev2> suckless is the closest to free software philosophy
[16:23:02] <kompowiec2> . The intention is that each time you build a package from a script, you get an identical result -- but it's not necessarily going to happen: the output of the package may not be the same if you built it versus when it's built by someone's else
[16:23:39] <kompowiec2> The reason is that the environment -- the OS -- changes (package upgrades, removals, additions), and unless you build all of the packages in exactly the same order as dev did, then your package may or may not link against a library -- depending on whether it was installed or not at the time; or perhaps some documentation may not be built because the tool to build it was not present or could not understand a newer format of 
[16:23:39] <kompowiec2> documentation.

[17:40:28] <kilobug> Whistler: that is not uncommon, first patents aren't valid world-wide, only in certain countries, and then some patent owners will allow usage of their tech in free software projects, sometimes under some conditions 
[17:41:06] <kilobug> Whistler: many corporations use patents not as a way to make money, but as a weapon to use to sue a competitor who would try to enforce a patent against them, or as a way to artificially increase their capital
[17:41:19] <kilobug> (the whole patants system is sick)
[17:41:37] <DiffieHellman> 3>patent owners *petent holders
[17:42:49] <DiffieHellman> Defensive patenting really does not work unless you have 1000+. If you have around 4 or so, that's not going to do much against a patent aggressor.
