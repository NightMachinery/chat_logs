[04:13:57] <_73> I have a laptop with two partitions being an efi partition and an encrpyted root partition. I usually have the laptop plugged into my monitor with an HDMI. When I boot my computer however I am forced to open my laptop to decrypt because I get no output on the monitor. Once I decrypt however the monitor connects fine. How can I be able to get monitor output during the decryption part of the boot process?
[04:15:13] <Namarrgon> you can try to disable the internal screen via kernel parameter

[17:16:56] <newbie90> If I didnt miss it twice, there is no mention of a root password before the boot step
[17:17:12] <baltazar> newbie90: pretty sure you have to run `passwd` even if you want an empty password (although I'm not sure why you would want that, especially for root)
[17:17:27] <Elagost> newbie90: you should boot back to the iso, chroot, make a user, and give it sudo. I believe if you don't set a password these days it just disables root login.
[17:17:45] <kirk781> For xScreensaver to work, I essentially just have to put it before the exec thing in xinitrc right?

[18:45:23] <jkc> It's a good idea to think about what would be left in place on the disk if you don't do that, and ask yourself if any of that remnant data matters to you.
[18:45:33] <mpan> garotosopa: it’s either filling with random data + ATA Secure Erase, or filling the encrypted block device with zeros. They serve different purposes, tho.
[18:45:50] <garotosopa> jkc: I don't, and I won't do either, I was just entertaining the thought.
[18:46:15] <mpan> garotosopa: that tells you to wipe the container with zeros, not urandom.
[18:46:37] <garotosopa> mpan: won't filling the encrypted block with zeroes turn out to be gibberish in the drive anyway?
[18:46:42] <mpan> jkc: no, filling with zeros is not for data erasure purposes. It’s for preventing metadata leaks from the container itself.

[18:50:17] <jkc> garotosopa: The "metadata" being referred to here are things that might indicate the disk is encrypted, how much storage is used, or possibly what filesystem is in use. If those things being observable doesn't seem too worrisome to you, then the extra effort of randomizing the disk may not be worth it.

[18:52:07] <garotosopa> jkc: Agreed.
[18:52:14] <mpan> garotosopa: there are two separate things at play here. First: possibibility of having *OLD DATA* left on the device. Unrelated to encryption, just some people may wish to erase it first. This should be done by filling the device with random data and executing ATA Secure Erase. The latter may be optional and the order may be reversed, depending on your needs.
[18:52:18] <garotosopa> jkc, mpan: Thanks for the input.
[18:52:51] <mpan> garotosopa: filling may also be done by using an encrypt container and filling it with zero, but obviously the same container can’t be used later for storing data if ATA Secure Erase is executed afterwards.

[18:53:24] <mpan> garotosopa: the second, unrelated thing, is filling the encrypted container with zero (or with anything TBH, zero is just the simplest) to prevent metadata from being leaked during encrypted volume use.
[18:53:45] <mpan> garotosopa: whether either of those is an issue to you depends on you. There is no one solution for everyone.

[18:56:50] <mpan> It’s the best practice, having a side effect of partially erasing the old data. Hence AW mentions that.

[22:54:01] <Jarcode> Betal: no, and attempts to do so will summon a black hole
[22:54:13] <Jarcode> you can run nouveau and amdgpu at the same time though
[22:54:25] <Betal> so that is the X problem I guess?
[22:54:30] <MacGyver> Jarcode: Tried optimus offloading to the nvidia GPU?
[22:54:48] <Jarcode> this isn't that kind of system
[22:54:56] <Jarcode> that's for iGPUs
[22:54:57] <MacGyver> Jarcode: wrong-historian on the r/vfio subreddit has a few posts describing the process, it involves paching optimus though.
[22:55:00] <MacGyver> Jarcode: No it's not.
[22:55:07] <Betal> for me nvidia works with radeon, never tested with amdgpu (old gpu)
[22:55:10] <MacGyver> Jarcode: Works perfectly fine with multiple dGPUs.

[22:55:43] <Jarcode> believe me I would use nvidia and amgpu together if I could

[22:59:18] <MacGyver> To be fair, running nvidia in a VM just so that when the inevitable kernel panic happens it only takes down the VM seems sensible to me.
[22:59:27] <Jarcode> because it's not an X configuration issue, I've had systems where I can manage all kinds of funky graphics setups, it's just getting both the devices serviced by a driver _on boot_
[22:59:53] <Jarcode> plus I enjoy the VM due to the fact that I keep most proprietary garbage in it

[23:10:23] *** Joins: jayray (~jayray@user/jayray)
[23:11:05] <Jarcode> because in theory you just need a "dummy" WM on the guest that forwards EWMH stuff and other requests to the host and back
