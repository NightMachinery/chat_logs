[00:08:49] <byteit101[m]> I am getting `ArgumentError: missing keyword: complete` every so often with gem irb which then exits
[00:09:31] <headius> Ok that's a new one to me
[00:40:44] <byteit101[m]> IRB or JRuby issue tracker?
[00:41:17] <headius> Do irb and copy me
[00:41:35] <headius> From issues I have been seeing I think the new IRB is not entirely baked
[00:42:15] <byteit101[m]> I'm not sure if it's just me though, as I think my rvm upgrade to 9.3 screwed up gem-wrappers somehow
[00:42:24] <byteit101[m]> now can't install but also get warnings
[00:42:33] <headius> Hmm ok
[00:44:01] <headius> I have never had the new IRB working perfectly but fixes might wait until 9.4 since you would have to opt into installing the new one
[00:46:10] <byteit101[m]> any thoughts on the classloader conundrum from last night?
[00:47:53] <byteit101[m]> hmm... I think I can probably clean up my rvm: jruby-1.7.19 jruby-9.1.5.0 jruby-9.1.6.0 jruby-9.1.17.0 jruby-9.2.0.0 :-O
[00:56:50] <byteit101[m]> Interesting, gem irb includes 'jruby' by default
[00:57:26] <byteit101[m]> Ok, fresh wipe of rvm gems same issue. Filing
[01:09:52] <byteit101[m]> headius: tagged you for https://github.com/ruby/irb/issues/295
[01:10:23] <byteit101[m]> should I file one that it requires 'jruby' by default?

[01:15:50] <headius> Hmm I wonder if they need it
[01:17:55] <byteit101[m]> Just surprised me as I was attempting to play with the classloader last nigth when switching between gem irb and shipped irb
[04:47:21] <rebelwarrior[m]> Where can I find a non-apple silicon Java? I just ran the Adopt Open JDK and while the website claims its x86... ```

[04:53:51] <rebelwarrior[m]> Changed jdk version got this:

[06:56:07] <headius> That's weird
[06:56:36] <headius> It should actually be x86 in adopt but you could try from Azul (Zulu) or Amazon Corretto
[06:56:46] <headius> Or just oracle
[06:56:56] <headius> That is a very strange error
[11:00:47] <meckispaghetti[m> I received the same error message yesterday when using rbenv, but in the end it was installed successfully ðŸ˜…
[12:01:31] <meckispaghetti[m> I wonder, what are your favourite ways to create GUIs in JRuby?
[19:52:37] *** Joins: klobuczek[m] (~klobuczek@2001:470:69fc:105::1:24c)
[19:57:21] <klobuczek[m]> has something changed in 9.3.0.0 regarding referencing java interface constants this way: `org.neo4j.driver.internal.util.Clock.SYSTEM`?
[20:01:01] <headius> klobuczek there was an issue filed about this against 9.2. I can't remember whether the feature was removed or never actually existed because I always thought you needed to use the double colon syntax
[20:02:18] <headius> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/5730
[20:03:38] <headius> Aha, so it was deprecated in 9.2
[20:03:40] <klobuczek[m]> the above works for me on 9.2.19.0
[20:04:01] <headius> Okay right, it was inconsistent because constants on classes never were accessible this way. It only worked on interfaces because of a probable typo in the code
[20:04:18] <klobuczek[m]> ok, the explains it
[20:06:02] <headius> My analysis on that bug shows that it stopped working for 9.2 when running Java 9 or higher because the constants no longer appear to be fully accessible
[20:06:23] <headius> So rather than fix that and keep the inconsistent behavior we just ditched it
[20:07:57] <klobuczek[m]> thank you for the clarification
[20:46:51] <headius> meckispaghetti I think most of us would recommend JavaFX via JRubyFX, byteit101 and enebo can probably point you in the right direction
[20:47:12] <headius> If you want something quick and basic there's the JDK Swing GUI components
[20:47:25] <headius> Frames, buttons, text entry, etc
[20:51:37] <meckispaghetti[m> Thank you! Is there a place where using Swing GUI components in JRuby is shown via examples?
[20:59:42] <headius> Yeah there are some basic examples in the samples dir
[21:37:05] <meckispaghetti[m> Thank you!
