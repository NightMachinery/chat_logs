[12:17:01] <twb> I don't understand the question because I don't know what genitive means
[12:17:26] <twb> But you can say "update the symbol prices" or "update the symbols's prices"
[12:17:50] <twb> The first one is using "symbol" as an adjective
[12:18:58] <twb> Are you REALLY trying to say something like "it's $5 to buy a "!" and $7 to buy a "#" because it uses more metal"
[12:19:04] <pycode> yes it is basically a procedure that updates all the prices of all the symbols i have in a database so i have to save a "title" for this "procedure"
[12:19:24] <pycode> twb, how is it called symbols's <--- that 's' :D
[12:20:07] <twb> That's a possessive
[12:21:12] <twb> I would probably just say "update_prices" or "update_symbol_prices"
[12:22:37] <pycode> twb, ok so basically the last one using "symbol" instead of "symbols"
[12:22:51] <pycode> but it still means that i am referring to multiple symbols
[12:23:21] <twb> Well, it's referring to *prices*.  What kind of prices?  Prices of symbols.
[12:23:41] <twb> Whereas "symbol's prices" is referring to prices that "belong to" symbols.
[12:23:57] <twb> A fine distinction
[12:25:41] <pycode> ok

[12:40:35] <twb> From https://www.police.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-04/Farm%20Security%20Checklist.pdf
[12:40:39] <Me-me> Needs a comma.
[12:40:47] <Me-me> Otherwise, what's the problem?
[12:40:54] <twb> I would have said "If you have dogs, are they microchipped?"
[12:41:02] <twb> Or "If you have a dog, is it microchipped?"
[12:41:05] <Me-me> Oh, right, of course.
[12:41:07] <Me-me> My bad.
[12:41:27] <twb> They're using singular they because sometimes animals are people

[12:41:51] <twb> Just wording it as plural avoids the contention without issue
[12:42:16] <Me-me> Aye. Might want to add "any" to clarify that you're not talking specifically about plurals.
[12:42:37] <Me-me> "If you have any dogs, are they microchipped?" That's something I'd expect to see on a form.
[12:44:39] <twb> Me-me: you mean singular-or-plural vs *exclusively* plural?
[12:44:47] <Me-me> Precisely.
[12:45:02] <twb> I definitely wouldn't have read it that way, but I guess I see what you mean
[12:45:36] <Me-me> I mean it's definitely overthinking it. Just a possible optimisation.

[13:44:12] <euouae> What's a succinct way to state that X and Y are permutations of each other?

[14:25:14] <Me-me> I'm afraid I don't have that context. It is simply the writer's perspective, or maybe assertion - some poetic meaning they associate with the new year.
[14:27:25] <itt788> "acting your age" means being accordingly to your age without trying to hide it?
