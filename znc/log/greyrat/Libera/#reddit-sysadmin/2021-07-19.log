[13:48:15] <dunz0r> aab_: Apartments in my country are cheaper than houses, if you don't want to live a 40 minute drive from a store
[13:48:31] <aab_> yeh
[13:49:02] <dunz0r> It's smaller though... and it feels a bit cramped. The SO's got a teenager living at home... three people in three rooms + kitchen is kind of small.
[13:49:11] <dunz0r> No proper place for a 'man cave':/
[13:50:01] <aab_> you can't have people with families living in an apartment far too small
[13:50:28] <dunz0r> It's not far too small, for us three. Totally works. Ideally I'd love two more rooms though.
[13:51:05] <dunz0r> But as long as the teenager is living at home, we're not moving anywhere. His dad has moved a lot, so we want him to feel he has a 'safe' place at his mums.

[13:56:54] <csws> but not as bad as you guys lol
[13:57:21] <csws> probably like 400k for a decent 4 bedroom 2 bath house 45 mins away from the city
[13:57:30] <csws> kangaroo bux
[13:57:43] <DK3> 400k for that sounds decent
[13:58:04] <csws> yeah the sacrifice is that you're a million miles from anywhere and the internet is slow
[13:58:18] <DK3> prices are up to 600-900k for a 4 bedroom house thats 30-40minute from city
[13:58:27] <Oliber> that's fine, just point ur starlink up
[13:58:48] <csws> nah issue is latency to international and shit
[13:58:55] <csws> you gotta get used to things being a bit slow
[13:58:56] <DK3> like 600k for a shitty 100m² house in a rural area
[13:59:31] <csws> genuinely the internet in canada really "felt" faster
[13:59:32] <Oliber> yeah upside downland isn't great for latency for gaming and stuff :/

[17:40:35] <PublicWiFi> or you just not going to them
[17:40:35] <estranger> tablespoon and teaspoon is at least a real measure
[17:40:47] <estranger> pinch/dash etc is BS

[17:41:16] <JollyRgrs> there's a reason baking isn't a job just for robots

[17:41:24] <DrZak> hmm
[17:41:30] <JollyRgrs> pinch/dash really means "i dunno, just a little bit, depending on how I feel"

[18:04:01] <int0x1C8> I like staring at them when they walk up with the generic "there's a problem with X" or even worse "can I get you to look at/help me with something?" then they stand there waiting for you to follow them back to their desk
[18:04:39] <int0x1C8> and won't explain further, so you get up and go to their desk just to turn numlock on

[21:40:11] <sd> 05<t​ahir> 
[21:40:11] <sd> 05<t​ahir> I’ve started a new remote role in an academic institution.
[21:40:11] <sd> 05<t​ahir> But the first task seems to be to migrate around 40 Linux servers (a couple of them seem to be Solaris, the rest Ubuntu) each running different bespoke applications for various academic purposes from one organisation to another organisation within the next 10 weeks or so.
[21:40:11] <sd> 05<t​ahir> 
[21:40:12] <sd> 05<t​ahir> The problem is that there is scant documentation as to what these Linux servers do and the purpose of the applications running on each one, how they were set-up (individually it seems by various academics over the years who have since left), and the majority of servers are on AWS, some on Google Cloud and a few on OpenStack. The Project Manager is looking at the purposes of the servers to be migrated from a business point of view.
[21:40:27] <csws> fwiw solaris is unix not linux

[21:42:23] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> yes it's more nuanced than that but it's how I do it
[21:42:31] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> then why are you talking about the vm's themselves, and just bundle up the disks and throw em into a hypervisor
[21:42:42] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> :this: 100%
[21:43:40] <sd> 05<t​ahir> So forget what the servers are doing, just bundle them up and transfer them to the new organisations AWS account?

[21:45:31] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> Yes, P2V = Physical to Virtual

[21:46:06] <sd> 05<t​ahir> So most of them are ec2's so it would be V2V.

[23:35:06] <sd> 10<e​rh> 
[23:35:06] <sd> 10<e​rh> > Finally, Microsoft calls the ability to create, start, stop, copy VMs using Hyper-V Platform simply Hyper-V. This ability is limited to Windows Server and Windows Pro, Enterprise, Education[6]. Do not confuse the ability to run VMs on Windows Hypervisor with Hyper-V. Windows 10 Home can use WSL2 containers running on Windows Hypervisor, it can also run VMs on Windows Hypervisor using Windows Hypervisor Platform API through VMWare/VirtualBox.
