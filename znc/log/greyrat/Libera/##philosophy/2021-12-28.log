[03:04:21] <Jong> How is the fallacy in the "first cause" argument for existence of God not  obvious? The obvious fallacy is that the entire argument is simply that there is a first cause, not that the first cause was conscious being and not dead like atoms and particles are.
[03:06:09] <Jong> Even if there was a beginning, what evidence is there that this beginning whatever it was was a conscious being? There's none. If anything, complexity evolves from simplicity. The simple comes before the complex. And consciousness is certainly more complex than whatever it runs on
[03:07:01] <Jong> It's like arguing a car existed before wheels, engines, breaks, and feul.
[03:08:03] <Jong> Looking at it from that analogy it's obvious the first cause argument is preposterous
[03:08:06] <Delf> This is assuming that there is actually a first
[03:08:28] <Jong> exactly, which hasn't been proved.
[03:08:43] <Delf> I have problem with time
[03:09:21] <Jong> so how did the "first cause" argument gain any traction given it's preposterous garbage
[03:09:57] <Jong> Is it really that hard to notice that arguing there's a first cause does not say anything about whether the first cause was a living being or a dead force?
[03:10:33] <Delf> I would not be able to argue because that is second order
[03:10:43] *** Joins: foxbox (~cammy@user/cammy)
[03:10:55] <Ungwelian> Jong, you need to define God before you start refuting it.
[03:11:07] <Ungwelian> And even then, others might define God differently.
[03:13:52] <Jong> Ungwelian  the general definition is not disputed. God means something that isn't dead. The only that I see disputed are subdetails
[03:14:53] <Jong> god refers to the supposed being that some people think created existence itself. That's the general definition with greatest concensus
[03:15:27] <Jong> If god doesn't mean that, then what else could god refer to
[03:18:36] <Ungwelian> Jong, there's hundreds and hundreds of religious denominations.
[03:18:45] <Ungwelian> In various major and minor religions.
[03:19:00] <Delf> God is a greedy character. It wants all honor but has none. It will ask all from you and promise you everything, after you have died. It's almost the shittiest personality ever. It wants you to sing for it too.
[03:19:07] <Ungwelian> With literal and esoteric traditions.
[03:19:23] <Ungwelian> ...and even phenomenological, immediate practises.
[03:19:48] <Jong> I stated above "The only [thing] that I see disputed are subdetails" And you just prove my point
[03:19:58] * Ungwelian sighs
[03:20:45] <Jong> Ungwelian  can you give me a definition of "god" that does not mean a being who created existence itself?
[03:20:48] <Ungwelian> I'm pretty sure you're pulling stuff from your hat with this "general definition" and "greatest consensus".
[03:21:30] <Jong> Ungwelian  it would be time consuming to survey the world's population with perfect precision.
[03:21:32] <Ungwelian> For example, Spinoza's God. And it's a fairly popular one.
[03:22:00] <Ungwelian> Lots and lots of eternalist interpretations.
[03:22:29] <Ungwelian> Then, you also have psychological interpretations.
[03:22:41] <Ungwelian> Polytheism. Pantheism. Panentheism.
[03:23:11] <Jong> Ungwelian  that's definition of god I'm seeing people use the word "universe" instead.
[03:23:25] <Ungwelian> Even the equivalent word for "god" doesn't exist in some languages.
[03:23:56] <Ungwelian> Then, there's ethical ones.
[03:24:17] <Ungwelian> Like a progressive Christian one, that god is the goodness in our hearts and in humanity.
[03:25:03] <Jong> The first cause argument was attempting to argument that existence began with a being willing it into existence.  I don't think the argument was that god is just another word for existence and because there is existence there is god
[03:25:53] <Ungwelian> There's lots of differing opinions on that too. Even within the same religions.
[03:26:17] <Ungwelian> Don't you see? You're fighting your own straw-man.

[03:27:50] <Jong> argh I dunno. Like you said my claim on whether there's a majority consensus of what god means, or what person who made the first cause argument thought god was, I really don't know.

[03:28:16] <Jong> no point of arguing things I can't find the answer to through arguing
[03:31:01] <Ungwelian> I think, what's a good road from here is listening to people.
[03:31:05] <Ungwelian> Have an open mind.
[03:31:17] <Ungwelian> Many won't even care about creation myths very much.
[03:31:29] <Ungwelian> They don't know either :)
[03:31:50] <causative_> Jong, you are correct, the first cause argument is absolutely stupid
[03:31:55] <causative_> lots of philosophy is stupid
[03:32:02] <Ungwelian> For a lot of people, god is simply a feeling of something greater than themselves. And a wish for hope.
[03:32:12] <Jong> My original question in this conversation is why the first cause gained traction when the problems with it seem obvious
[03:32:29] <causative_> because people wanted an excuse to believe in God and seem logical doing so
[03:32:43] <causative_> they didn't care if it *actually* held water, only if they could declare their tribal allegiance with an appearance of logic
[03:33:09] <Ungwelian> My guess is that people have been asking existential questions since the dawn of time.
[03:33:16] <Ungwelian> Even in Stone Age.
[03:33:24] <Ungwelian> "How did this all come to be?"
[03:33:51] <Ungwelian> People like stories, and stories mix in with fantasy and reality.
[03:34:16] <Jong> causative_  I wonder if people saw at a conscious level that they were making unwarranted leaps in logic for emotional reasons of wanting there to be a god
[03:35:30] <causative_> well Jong I guess if you accepted the first cause argument and *also* believed that nothing great can arise without a designer, the first cause argument would lead you to think there was a designer
[03:35:52] <Jong> Ungwelian  I also notice an anthropomorphism constantly used throughout history to try to explain why existence exists
[03:36:03] <causative_> "something had to come first, and since it created everything it must be an intelligent designer, therefore we can call that thing that came first God"
[03:36:30] <causative_> wrong in all steps, but persuasive if you don't think too hard about it and don't know about modern physics or evolution
[03:36:41] <Jong> causative_  but where did the intelligent designer come from?
[03:36:46] <Jong> obvious rebuttal
[03:37:02] <causative_> they would resolve this by saying God is outside time
[03:37:14] <causative_> so he didn't have to come from anywhere, the notion of time does not apply
[03:37:30] <Delf> The moment he does a first, it is no longer just outside time
[03:38:01] <Jong> causative_  and the rebuttal would be "what evidence do you have that there is a god outside time?"  Evidence shows simple comes before complex.
[03:38:30] <causative_> yes evidence shows that *now* Jong but it's not a truth everyone accepts, and in the past it wasn't so clear that a more complex thing could come from a simpler one
[03:38:46] <Delf> Why would (<- TIME) a being outside time, ever do anything, at all
[03:39:07] <causative_> which it certainly can, but the more usual pre-modern observation is that complex things had to be made by equally or even more complex things, namely humans
[03:42:27] <Jong> I don't know if the universe began with life, but I know it contains life.
[03:43:18] <Jong> life gets pushed around by the dead (wind, rain, hurricanes). Not the other way around.
[03:47:54] <Delf> What if it never began!
[04:05:07] <Jong> what if. I don't know

[06:36:31] <Jong> If life came about by pure random chance given a universe a set of natural forces, wouldn't that mean that if a computer could simulate a universe and natural forces that life would be created within the computer simulation?
[06:38:25] <Jong> Now suppose we could set the computer simulation to be 1 million times as fast as our universe. Then would we expect life to come about 1 million times faster than it took for humans to come to exist?
[06:38:58] *** Quits: Leonarbro (~Leonet@user/leonarbro) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[06:39:16] <causative_> sure, except the problem is you can't simulate the universe inside the universe faster than the universe
[06:39:44] <causative_> that would be like running a VM of your computer that runs faster than your computer - it's just not going to happen
[06:42:47] <amigojapan> Jong: you can't simulate our universe inside a computer cause you would need to simulate every particle, and that would need as many particles to store the state of each particle. You would need to simulate a much simpler universe
[06:43:20] <Jong> man I just thought the same thing right before reading what you wrote :/
[06:43:34] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[06:43:43] <Jong> amigojapan maybe a simplified universe also can create life?
[06:43:57] *** Joins: Leonarbro (~Leonet@user/leonarbro)
[06:43:57] <amigojapan> Perhaps...
[06:45:12] <amigojapan> Jong: even simulating all the particles inside a single human brain is still beyond our current capacity
[06:46:18] <amigojapan> Jong: simulations look amazing cause they don't simulate particles, instead they use beshes and shaders which are much simpler
[06:46:32] <amigojapan> Meshes*
[06:47:41] <causative_> you *can* simulate our universe inside a computer - storage space is not a problem because whenever you run out you simply make the computer larger. What you can't do is simulate our universe *faster*,
[06:48:20] <causative_> as an example a universal Turing machine is capable of simulating itself
[06:48:33] <amigojapan> causative_: the computer would need to use all the particles in the universe as memory
[06:48:37] <causative_> no
[06:48:42] <amigojapan> Yes
[06:49:03] <causative_> first let's suppose that our universe is finite and growing over time, which is possible (though not at present likely)
[06:49:16] <causative_> in this case to simulate the beginning of the universe takes only a little memory
[06:49:25] <causative_> because the beginning of the universe was very small
[06:49:30] <causative_> so you can do that on a computer
[06:49:57] <causative_> then as the simulation progresses you just need to keep acquiring more memory - and the universe itself gets larger as you do so, so that more memory becomes available
[06:50:17] <causative_> as long as your demand for memory doesn't increase faster than the size of the universe itself, it's possible to run your simulation
[06:50:53] <causative_> so that's the solution in the case when the universe began small and finite and grew over time
[06:51:32] <causative_> now consider the case when the universe has had a fixed size. What you do in this case is simulate an ever-larger piece of it
[06:52:25] <causative_> begin by simulating just a small piece at the universe's beginning, as if everything else was gone, and run that for a while. Then start over with a larger part of space, and so on, until the space you are simulating is as large as you like, including everything in your light-cone.
[06:52:45] <causative_> again, as long as your demand for memory doesn't outstrip the size of the universe, this is possible
[06:53:24] <causative_> er, I said "fixed size" but in the preceding I meant a fixed and infinite size
[06:54:05] <causative_> amigojapan, think about Hilbert's infinite hotel and you will see how it becomes possible to simulate an infinity within an infinity
[06:54:18] <causative_> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel
[06:54:18] <ro-bot-o> [url] Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[06:55:43] <Jong> causative_  where do you learn this stuff?
[06:56:17] <Jong> In what college course would i expect to learn about Hilbert's paradox of the grand hotel
[06:57:32] <causative_> maybe you would see it in a discrete math course, depending on the course, idk
[06:57:36] <causative_> I saw it in Gamow's book
[06:58:08] <causative_> but ideas about simulating things would be mostly treated in a course on theory of computation
[06:59:59] <causative_> e.g. the concept of a universal Turing machine is theory of computation
[07:01:48] <amigojapan> causative_: hmmm I will need to think about it, of course that assumes lost of things about our universe which we don't really know, like if it really started in a big band, the initial conditions of the universe and wether the universe is finite at all
[07:02:02] <Jong> causative_  do you learn this stuff as an enthusiast? Or as part of your job?
[07:03:51] <causative_> I learned theory of computation in college
[07:03:54] <amigojapan> causative_: also wether quarks are the smallest unit in the universe possible
[07:05:16] <causative_> amigojapan, yes it does depend on such things
[07:05:34] <causative_> if the universe is finite and *fixed size* then probably it can't simulate itself
[07:05:47] <causative_> but if it's infinite, or if it's finite and growing over time, then in principle it could
[07:06:44] <causative_> of course, we don't truly have a rigorous definition of what it means to "simulate" something
[07:06:47] <causative_> and that's unfortunate
[07:07:11] <causative_> philosophy and mathematics seem to have not come up with an adequate definition for that, I've looked
[07:09:40] <mannequin> another absdtract! https://vlepy.github.io/2021/12/28/abstract32b.html
[07:09:40] <ro-bot-o> [url] Abstract 31b | vlepy.github.io
[07:10:59] <amigojapan> I think many people look at our current video games and say "oh this is so amazing. Like a small universe inside a computer"and don't realise they are simplifications
[07:12:42] <causative_> they are, but it is possible to trade-off time for space
[07:13:09] <causative_> you can have your simulation be very slow in exchange for using less space

[11:11:03] <shea> I don't.
[11:13:42] <Jong> What about a routine, like waking up at the same time every day?
[11:14:37] <Jong> I'm asking because I feel I have no structure in my life. I don't wake up at the same time every day, or go to sleep at the time. I don't do anything in a predefined time interval. I wonder if this is bad

[16:11:57] * arryana pushes tea to pussipupu
[16:15:04] <arryana> i think part of the trap of depression is that not wanting to do anything makes things worse
[16:15:49] <arryana> if a bored/depressed person were to make a list of ten things that would improve their lives, they almost assuredly could achieve several of them with a bit of concerted effort
[16:17:32] <arryana> for instance, a messy living space is usually a given.  but half an hour a day of cleaning is possible for anyone who isn't so depressed that they should be in a locked facility
[16:18:16] <arryana> the improvement in their environment and satisfaction of accomplishing something is therapeutic

[16:37:20] <arryana> growth always carries a measure of discomfort.  that's just how it is.
[16:37:30] <arryana> totally worth it, though
[16:38:25] <arryana> i think help is crucial, particularly in the early stages.  but i think having everything done for them in that state is well-meaning poison
[16:39:46] <arryana> much like physical therapy.  it'd be unreasonable to expect someone with extensive atrophy to get up and walk.  but requiring them to work a little toward it every day is the only way to get them back on their feet.

[20:31:04] <blah24> it depends i suppose, there is good fake and bad fake. a whore will pretend to love you then rob you for example, i'd prefer no love to that i think
[20:31:26] <blah24> but if someone makes the effort to fake love without robbing me then i'll take that
[20:31:44] <biys> i think if you're going to a whore and believing that her love is genuine...  you likely have other defects

[21:13:35] <arryana> it was a little unsettling that it was summer.  similar in hawaii.

[21:29:59] <I_Am_M00t> can't have Christmas without palm trees
[21:30:01] <I_Am_M00t> amirite
[21:31:40] <evolv> feels that way now
[21:32:02] <evolv> it's been three years I haven't had Christmas in FL
[21:32:03] <I_Am_M00t> can't have Christmas with a lil sunny beach time
[21:32:09] <I_Am_M00t> without a lil*
[21:32:24] <evolv> I never been to the beach during Christmas
[21:32:33] <evolv> it's cold to Floridians
[21:33:01] <I_Am_M00t> so... kinda warm?
[21:33:01] <evolv> usually winter in FL is met with frequent overcasts, so I associate overcasts with Winter
[21:33:29] <I_Am_M00t> :>
[21:33:32] <I_Am_M00t> awww
[21:33:50] <evolv> and frequent thunderstorms == summer
[21:34:03] <evolv> spring == fall
[21:34:27] <evolv> May and June are the worst months of the year
[21:34:29] <I_Am_M00t> spring = fall everywehere
[21:34:47] <I_Am_M00t> spring is a social construct
[21:35:02] <arryana> i enjoyed my time there, but it isn't a place i'd go back to soon
[21:35:05] <evolv> leaves change in the midwest and northeast
[21:35:20] <evolv> not in FL
[21:35:31] <evolv> so spring and fall look the same in FL
[21:38:45] <I_Am_M00t> is it true that Floridians eat cigarette butts as a drinking game?
[21:38:53] <I_Am_M00t> :D
[21:39:28] <pussipupu> Spring and autumn aren't easy to confuse here
[21:40:29] <arryana> here either
[21:44:34] <pussipupu> I'm going to guess climate in Scotland is somewhat a mixture of English and Finnish
[21:45:17] <pussipupu> just because that's what I'm familiar with
[21:48:10] <arryana> i haven't been to finland, but it's colder than england
[21:48:24] <arryana> not vastly different, the wind is more changeable
[21:49:33] <pussipupu> Oceanic weather still, here is pretty continental
[21:51:14] * arryana nods
[21:51:24] <arryana> i'm still getting used to it, i can't reliably tell the weather here yet
[21:51:34] <arryana> though the official forecast doesn't do much better
[21:53:41] <pussipupu> my weather nose still isn't right here and I've lived here for ages
[21:54:33] <arryana> i usually do okay, side effect of having lived outside for years.  but it's still an adjustment here, and it's been just over a year.
[21:54:48] <evolv> I_Am_M00t, I never heard of that before
[21:58:42] <I_Am_M00t> i can show you videos
[22:04:27] <blah24> what do you think about redefining failure as success? since it means you tried
[22:04:55] <blah24> success aiming can be paralysing
[22:06:39] <arryana> it depends how much you need valid results
[22:07:11] <arryana> if you want to paint a room poorly, but it's better than it was before, sure that's a success.  if you want to fix your car, it's only success if your car runs.
[22:07:38] <pussipupu> To be fair I'm better than most locals at least in the immediate, but back when I sailed a lot I was s weather witch
[22:08:18] <pussipupu> Blanket redefining failure as success just robs you of expressive and analytical power
[22:08:37] *** Quits: denza242 (~denza242@sapphire/support/denza242) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[22:10:06] <arryana> it also keeps you from really learning competence
[22:12:58] <blah24> have you ever done it?
[22:13:06] <arryana> i suppose i'd feel badly for any hypothetical person whose neurosis demanded that they value their ego more than reality, but i certainly wouldn't hire them to do anything
[22:13:17] * arryana shrugs
[22:13:30] <arryana> almost assuredly when i was young.  but growing up gives a lot more perspective
[22:14:15] <blah24> think of it like this: say you're an ex convict applying for a job, how is it possible to keep applying and trying after 1000s of rejections? you have to define failure as success
[22:14:26] <blah24> and you have a terrible CV and writing skills
[22:14:31] <blah24> and poor interview technique
[22:14:50] <blah24> so it's a baseline for success to define failure as success
[22:15:22] <arryana> i'd suggest they aim lower, get any job, do it well, and get a good reference for a better one.
[22:15:39] <arryana> it's also possible to study interview technique videos on youtube
[22:15:57] <blah24> are you able to think abstractly?
[22:16:47] <arryana> there are also programs for rehabilitation and job placement.
[22:16:57] <arryana> what sort of question is that
[22:16:59] <arryana> ?
[22:17:31] <blah24> arryana: i'm asking about redefining failure as success and i gave an example, you have fixated on the example and given my pseudo-human life advice
[22:19:21] <biys> she does that
[22:19:51] <arryana> you asked a question, and i answered it
[22:20:08] <biys> they definitely answered a question you didn't ask
[22:20:20] <biys> blah24: if there's any advice i can give you about this channel
[22:20:25] <biys> it's avoid interacting with arryana
[22:20:25] <arryana> 'redefining failure as success' is only fooling yourself, in the case of your example.  it doesn't mean you're suddenly fit for the job you want.
[22:20:35] <biys> they are probably one of the largest trolls on this channel after I_Am_M00t
[22:20:57] <pussipupu> The example seems to rest on totalising something into one of two categories, which isn't useful or reflective of reality
[22:20:58] <blah24> <arryana> it depends how much you need valid results
[22:20:58] <blah24> <arryana> if you want to paint a room poorly, but it's better than it was before, sure that's a success.  if you want to fix your car, it's only success if your car runs.
[22:21:02] <blah24> this was the abstract thought
[22:21:09] <blah24> so i was a bit harsh
[22:21:19] <biys> instead of debating the conversation as it stands they will typically create a straw man as to attack your character
[22:21:24] <biys> then they will attempt to brow beat you
[22:21:32] <biys> once that proves unsuccessful they will appeal to authority to have you banned
[22:21:45] <biys> it's pretty much their M.O
[22:21:49] <biys> if you wait around long enough you will see
[22:21:57] <blah24> you seem fixated on her biys
[22:21:58] <pussipupu> Activities can result in complex mixtures of success and failure, which are of course not absolute but perspective based
[22:22:21] <biys> blah24: i'm just amazed they're allowed to exist in this channel given their constant behaviour
[22:24:11] <blah24> biys: women are highly sought after on the intershits
[22:24:20] <biys> intershits ?
[22:24:41] <biys> internships ?
[22:24:48] <blah24> internet
[22:24:51] <biys> oh
[22:25:11] <biys> yes, beta males typically will attempt to appeal to any women on the internet in attmpt to increase their potential to procreate
[22:25:48] <biys> i actually wrote an editorial about how it's easier for women in the work place than it is for men
[22:26:11] <blah24> cool, what's easier?
[22:27:02] * arryana pushes a port to pussipupu
[22:27:21] <biys> well.  there's three main points i make.  one of which is, given the displacement of men to available women within the subset they can choose
[22:27:35] <biys> men will be overly assistive to women in an attempt to increase their potential for procreation
[22:27:41] <blah24> ha
[22:27:45] <biys> it's also in the fact that most men are taught chivalry
[22:27:53] <biys> where it's the mans job to do the heavy lifting
[22:27:59] <biys> to open doors
[22:27:59] <blah24> i agree with that
[22:28:33] <blah24> i open doors only to people behind me though
[22:28:34] <biys> so on and so forth.  so you have a lot of well trained beta males that are essentially alleviating women of particular tasks they see as being too hard for them
[22:28:39] <blah24> i would never ever open a door out of my way
[22:28:46] <blah24> that would be perverse
[22:28:55] <biys> it's in the mind that they _ought_ to be _helpful_
[22:29:16] <biys> the other part of this is something along the canadian employment equity laws
[22:29:20] <blah24> beta males are an essential part of society
[22:29:27] <biys> where women actually are to receive "special accomodations"
[22:29:31] <biys> in the work place
[22:29:38] <biys> and businesses are rewarded for hiring "equity groups"
[22:29:41] * pussipupu offers arryana cheddar and cream crackers
[22:29:45] <biys> (women fall into the equity group)
[22:30:02] <blah24> biys: have you seen sin city?
[22:30:03] <biys> this is in canada, idk how the rest of the world works
[22:30:08] <biys> blah24: no, i haven't

[22:30:39] <biys> the third proof to my editorial is something like... with the change in the current narrative surrounding womens rights and the metoo movement
[22:30:49] <biys> men are compelled in a certain way to be overly respectful towards woen
[22:30:50] <biys> women
[22:31:07] <biys> ebcause, as we've seen time and time again, all a woman has to do is make an allegation; they can ruin your life
[22:31:15] <arryana> opening a door for someone else is just polite.  it doesn't matter what's in their trousers.
[22:31:34] <biys> the allegation can have no merit or proof
[22:31:38] <biys> the allegation can be baseless
[22:31:52] <biys> yet the destruction that takes place is real
[22:31:54] <blah24> biys: this is false, you can sue them and win money
[22:32:12] <biys> well.  look at Jiam Ghomeshi as an example
[22:32:21] <biys> he lost a significant amount of things even though he "won" the trial
[22:32:29] <blah24> yes your reputation can be harmed
[22:32:36] <blah24> but a reputation deserves harm
[22:33:08] <blah24> would you rather that comey creep was still in power?
[22:33:19] <biys> still in power?
[22:33:30] <biys> he was a writer/musician/broadcaster/content creator
[22:33:45] <blah24> oh not comey
[22:33:47] <blah24> some politician
[22:33:52] <biys> oooh
[22:33:56] <audrey> Cuomo.
[22:34:00] <biys> i get what you're saying
[22:34:02] <biys> beg your pardon
[22:34:22] <blah24> yes cuomo
[22:35:16] <blah24> biys: how do you feel about the fact that some business will refuse to hire unattractive women?
[22:35:20] <blah24> businesses*
[22:35:25] <arryana> i don't really see what opening doors for people has to do with your last topic
[22:35:52] <blah24> arryana: biys has a fixation on women
[22:36:05] <biys> blah24: there is a lot to be said about physical appearances and a persons relative success
[22:36:08] <blah24> i'm responding to it
[22:36:13] <arryana> if you've lost interest in your last topic, okay with me.
[22:36:15] <biys> so i don't think it's unreasonable to have physical appearance as a factor
[22:36:41] <blah24> arryana: well i was also thinking that failure to procreate cannot be defining as success in procreating
[22:36:47] <blah24> defined*
[22:37:06] <blah24> so certain vices can obstruct the system
[22:37:56] <blah24> exploitation of the reward system
[22:38:09] <blah24> negatively
[22:38:28] <blah24> the bollocks must remain as full as possible, and the heart must not be emptied for lust.
[22:38:30] <biys> what also seems interesting to me is that this is another thing with arryana
[22:38:35] <biys> they're aware they have be ignored
[22:38:45] <biys> and when i chat with people in here she believes they're having a one sided conversation
[22:39:04] <blah24> i sensed there was an ignore fued going on
[22:39:23] <blah24> why don't you two agree to not talk to nor about each other and yet unblock each other?
[22:39:30] <biys> i have no-one blocked
[22:39:46] <arryana> i have no idea what you're on about with the procreating thing.
[22:39:48] <arryana> so i can't respond
[22:39:53] <audrey> biys: maybe if another chatter annoys you, try /ignoring them instead of spending lots of vertical real estate complaining about it
[22:40:14] <blah24> yes biys i suggest you block her
[22:40:18] <blah24> for your mental health
[22:40:30] <audrey> it´s kind of tiring to hear all the sniping, you really should be better than that
[22:40:42] <audrey> I´d rather get this back to an object-level conversation
[22:41:13] <blah24> i want to fix biys tbh

[22:44:12] <blah24> to my great pleasure
[22:44:22] <biys> nepotism is real
[22:44:55] <blah24> yes
[22:45:29] <blah24> sometimes we should go with things that overpower us rather than strive against them

[22:47:16] * evolv hands audrey the wooden spoon
[22:47:45] <audrey> evolv: hot?
[22:47:47] <audrey> :|
[22:47:56] <evolv> maybe
[22:48:01] <evolv> that's what Italians beat their kids with
[22:48:25] <evolv> the mother stirring the sauce in between
[22:48:39] <audrey> I´m not a fan of child abuse. :|
[22:48:54] <audrey> also if you want to get a kid to do something, psychological terrorizing is much more effective than beating
[22:48:59] <evolv> neither am I, which is when it became a joke in my family
[22:49:28] <audrey> beating up your kids just increases the odds they´ll beat you up when you´re the one in (second) childhood
[22:49:39] <audrey> as my great-grandfather, a great abusive alcoholic prick, found out
[22:50:37] <evolv> I never understood the belt and wooden spoon thing. They were used, but I guess not in a way that caused terror
[22:50:43] <evolv> the Italian guilt was more powerful
[22:51:13] <blah24> just make everything a choice and they cease to choose in err
[22:51:26] <biys> my mom used a very wide leather belt when we were younger.  my sister and i thought we'd pull a fast one and hide the belt.  she came out with a little skinny leather belt one day
[22:51:31] <biys> we promptly returned the thick belt
[22:51:57] <blah24> i was never once hit by parents
[22:52:08] <blah24> but i was beaten to near death by security guards in my late teens
[22:52:14] <audrey> Gaslighting, public shaming, emotional neglect, and forced isolation are all much better at getting a child to behave.
[22:52:23] <audrey> I know this because I grew up like that. :|

[22:54:29] <Ungwelian> Beating kids is physical abuse.
[22:54:33] <arryana> haha
[22:54:49] <evolv> I agree, never hit your kids, never shame your kids, never guilt your kids
[22:55:00] <evolv> positive reinforcement is hard but far more powerful
[22:55:28] <blah24> punishment can be an endless cycle without fruit
[22:55:30] <evolv> it's probably hard because I didn't grow up with a pure positive reinforcement upbringing
[22:55:46] <evolv> lots of yelling
[22:55:56] <evolv> and guilt
[22:56:16] <arryana> i think philip larkin had it right
[22:56:23] <evolv> not entirely, a lot of positive reinforcement and understanding, too
[22:56:35] <Ungwelian> I don't even understand the logic in it.
[22:56:38] <arryana> this be the verse
[22:56:57] <Ungwelian> The proponents think you'll train the kid to behave by fearing beatings.
[22:57:00] <evolv> we can know something is wrong but struggle changing a bad habit
[22:57:33] <audrey> arryana: I´ll toast to that!
[22:57:46] <evolv> fear can get the behavior desired that persists throughout life, but along with torment and often other consequences
[22:58:08] <Ungwelian> As if person X beating you up means, that - inductively - every person will beat you up at "wrong" behaviour.
[22:59:26] <arryana> right? the guy was inspired
[22:59:38] <blah24> what exactly is bad behaviour that warrant such severe attitudes? this is all folly

[23:02:12] <Ungwelian> "High punishment males were also more conservative than low punishment males."
[23:02:30] <Ungwelian> Want the kid to vote the right? Beat the kid up.
[23:02:46] <evolv> that doesn't establish causality
[23:02:48] <audrey> Victorian upbringing!
[23:03:16] <audrey> Like the thing where you would let an infant ¨cry it out¨ in the night, because by fussing over it, the infant learns that it can get what it wants via tantrums
[23:03:17] <blah24> the victorians caused both world wars

[23:07:21] <evolv> I'm sure audrey's inflection and context of conversation would come across better irl
[23:07:24] <blah24> justifiably*
[23:08:06] <blah24> the light of the eyes children provide heals the ills of society
[23:08:56] <audrey> I basically spent my life up to 18 years of age in a room alone with books and music.
[23:09:18] <blah24> wow poor you
[23:09:21] <audrey> And in retrospect I realize that wasn´t particularly healthy.
[23:09:30] <blah24> all those books and instruments to play with
[23:09:52] <audrey> and in retrospect I also understand my parents´ faults better
[23:10:07] <audrey> so this is why I am jaded
[23:10:35] <blah24> i don't care you don't have to pollute your past on the present
[23:10:43] <audrey> because even if you think you are so moral and righteous that you won´t use corporal punishment on your child, you may inadvertently end up doing even worse to them emotionally
[23:10:56] <arryana> unfortunately, parents are just fallible, damaged people who ended up trying to be responsible for other people, and lacking most of the tools.
[23:11:00] <evolv> why are you being mean, blah24?
[23:11:11] <audrey> Anyway, I´m sorry the cynicism didn´t come across blatantly enough to you.
[23:11:45] <arryana> it sounds to me like your idealistic views of redefining things also apply to childhood, blah24
[23:13:27] <blah24> sounds to me you've been calling oranges apples for so long reality offends you
[23:14:10] <arryana> haha
[23:14:14] <arryana> whatever you say, chief.

[23:15:57] <evolv> how does anyone get banned from ##religion?
[23:16:58] <blah24> personal insults
[23:17:12] <evolv> stop insulting people
[23:17:53] <audrey> Beats me. That channel has even laxer moderation than ##philosophy
[23:18:09] <blah24> i called someone demented because he was demented and an ex druggie
[23:18:11] <audrey> (and I own it. lol)
[23:18:18] <audrey> (so maybe it reflects badly on me)
[23:18:35] <arryana> haha
[23:23:18] <blah24> i regret calling him demented but i found a better channel for religious discussion
[23:27:24] <evolv> I think blah24 was talking about kish
[23:27:51] <evolv> he's 1 of 4 active people there and an ex-druggie

[23:28:28] <blah24> i'm not going to say who it is, because i care for them and wish i didnt call them that
[23:28:32] <evolv> Astarte?
[23:29:02] <evolv> presumably because of your "!seen" in the channel
[23:29:04] <blah24> he was just exemplifying how fragile psychedelics make the human mind
[23:29:21] <evolv> he's always mad at me for something
[23:29:29] <arryana> i can't say i'm deeply convinced of your regret, you've certainly been obnoxious to me anytime i say anything you don't like.
[23:29:34] <arryana> so if you've learned, it isn't deeply.
[23:30:21] <blah24> <audrey> also if you want to get a kid to do something, psychological terrorizing is much more effective than beating
[23:30:38] <blah24> fuck you you disgusting piece of shit how is that?
[23:31:28] <blah24> am i being appropriately polite to you?
[23:31:32] * arryana shrugs
[23:31:36] <arryana> not particularly impressive
[23:31:44] <arryana> but if you keep it up, i'll just /ignore you
[23:32:05] <evolv> did blah24 confused arryana with audrey?
[23:32:14] <blah24> holy shit
[23:32:29] <blah24> i deserve to be banned
[23:32:30] <Ungwelian> What is happening?
[23:32:41] <blah24> all my insults were meant for audrey
[23:32:44] <evolv> I think blah24 might not be entirely with us in this dimension
[23:32:53] <arryana> tantrums just aren't that impressive.
[23:33:20] <blah24> well you're still enabling her as a mod so idc
[23:33:27] <evolv> enabling what?
[23:33:58] <blah24> forget it if you can't see i wont guide you to the piss you're drinking
[23:34:59] <evolv> I don't think anyone else made the assumption that she was speaking as an advocate
[23:35:45] <blah24> i dont care what you think
[23:36:10] <evolv> I think you should care about properly interpreting things before upsetting yourself for no reason
[23:36:17] <evolv> it'll save you grief, at minimum
[23:36:37] <Ungwelian> It was totally clear that audrey was being sarcastic.
[23:37:07] <Ungwelian> I've been on this channel for over a year and she has never presented herself as being ok with child abuse.
[23:37:07] <evolv> there you go, and Ungwelian and I have disagreed with each other many times before
[23:37:24] <blah24> you all remind me of the yellow guy in sin city
[23:37:35] <evolv> I've never seen Sin City and won't get the referenc
[23:38:03] <arryana> me either
[23:38:15] <Ungwelian> blah24, this frankly just seems like you're trying to pick a fight. A kind of self-destructive behaviour.
[23:38:33] <Ungwelian> Banned from one place, you're fishing for another ban.
[23:38:38] <Ungwelian> "Burning bridges".
[23:38:38] <pussipupu> I liked it at the time, though I don't know how I'd like it now
[23:38:41] <pussipupu> Sin City that is

[23:39:38] <arryana> not interested.
[23:42:06] <blah24> thanks for telling us
[23:42:27] <evolv> I both liked and disliked Matrix 4 spelling out all of the meanings of the trilogy
[23:43:04] <evolv> and I disliked how people still didn't get it despite being told explicitly the messages of the original movies
[23:43:40] <krb> still didn't explain how neo was able to manipulate the "real world" in one movie
[23:43:41] <arryana> i've only seen the first one
[23:44:10] <evolv> krb, the clues were what he could manipulate and what he could see
[23:45:38] <blah24> i didnt like the inappropriate 4th wall breaking
[23:45:49] <arryana> i don't get some of the stuff about the first movie, even
[23:45:50] <arryana> like...
[23:46:18] <arryana> everyone can learn to fly a helicopter in 2.4 seconds, but nobody can knit.  there isn't an un-torn sweater in all of their city.
[23:46:22] <evolv> the 4th wall breaking was all part of the revealing the intended messages of the original trilogy
[23:47:03] <evolv> lol, arryana
[23:47:15] <evolv> everyone wore their sunglasses at night, too
[23:49:22] <arryana> seriously.
[23:49:37] <blah24> if lana kept her bollocks the world would be better
[23:51:05] <blah24> matrix would have been a tv series
[23:51:05] <pussipupu> arryana: as a great man once said "I wonder if I can play the accordion too"
[23:52:06] <pussipupu> Though also to be fair assuming their air con works they might well not need jumpers for warmth and like the shabby look
[23:52:30] * arryana smiles
[23:52:37] <arryana> well, they're all wearing torn sweaters
[23:54:00] <blah24> i liked the british twins in 2
[23:54:23] <blah24> we owe you for that
