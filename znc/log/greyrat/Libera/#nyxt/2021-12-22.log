[00:00:00] <qhong> haha
[00:00:09] <jmercouris> I was thinking “wow, he is super late awake for being in China”
[00:00:24] <qhong> I drop all lectures since high school so my time has U(1) symmetry
[00:00:38] <qhong> spoiler: it doesn't make sense for west coast time zone either
[00:00:42] <jmercouris> Lol
[00:00:54] <jmercouris> Well, then
[00:01:39] *** Quits: amk (~amk@109.255.169.126) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:01:54] <qhong> Regarding the prompter match highlighting feature we talked about last time, I think the "right way" to do is to let prompter accept arbitrary DOM tree rather than text string. Do you think this is doable in current architecture?
[00:02:11] <qhong> And I think in general functions should pass around DOM rather than plain text string when possible
[00:02:52] <jmercouris> I wish that were possible
[00:03:05] <jmercouris> Now it really depends on what you mean when you say a arbitrary dom tree
[00:03:23] <jmercouris> Do you mean a representation of a dom tree as something created by plump?
[00:03:55] <jmercouris> Or do you mean the actual memory representing a dom tree as created in a web view?
[00:04:01] <jmercouris> The first is possible, the second is not
[00:04:33] <jmercouris> The first serializes to a string anyway, but I could maybe see the advantage in dealing with structured vs unstructured data
[00:04:40] <qhong> Yes, exactly
[00:05:15] <qhong> And even if it serializes to a HTML string it's different from passing plain text string. But ofc no one want to mess with HTML string.
[00:05:26] <jmercouris> Cierto
[00:05:50] <jmercouris> It can be done
[00:06:01] <jmercouris> I suggest making the function agnostic
[00:06:12] <jmercouris> Accept either a string or a dom root node
[00:06:28] <jmercouris> Or turn it into a method and have it specialize on either case
[00:06:43] <qhong> Agree. Just a generic function.
[00:07:11] <qhong> Maybe before making this happen there's one thing more I should do: something like spinnernet but output plump tree directly
[00:07:44] <qhong> building a plump tree using the provided imperative `make-element' API is not very pleasant
[00:07:55] <jmercouris> This is turn
[00:07:58] <jmercouris> True*
[00:08:09] <jmercouris> If there was a way to specify the tree as a sexp it would be ideal
[00:09:01] <jmercouris> It seems like it could be possible
[00:09:12] <jmercouris> In a straightforward way
[00:09:29] <jmercouris> qhong: how is Nyxt running on macOS?
[00:09:35] <jmercouris> I assume you are using master?
[00:11:18] <qhong> jmercouris: It crashes for any complicated website (like YouTube immediately, or GitHub after a few jumps). Sadly I think it's not very usable for web browsing at the moment
[00:11:47] <qhong> For me however I don't browse that much, I'm interested in a Lisp environment instead, so it works well for me ~_<
[00:11:57] <jmercouris> Hm I see
[00:12:05] <jmercouris> That’s too bad
[00:12:10] <jmercouris> Works so much better on linux
[00:12:13] <qhong> I guess the issue may be that webkit2-gtk from macports is very outdated?
[00:12:21] <jmercouris> Well, it’s not just that
[00:12:29] <jmercouris> It’s also not tested on macOS at all
[00:12:42] <jmercouris> The only reason it works is because of the efforts of a macports developer and myself
[00:12:50] <jmercouris> We got no support from the webkitgtk team
[00:13:50] <qhong> I see. If webkitgtk is /quality software/ the same version should have same behavior on mac and linux. Maybe it's just /quality software/ doesn't exist :[
[00:14:20] <jmercouris> Maybe

[03:51:15] <pedro-delfino> Hi guys, I would like to ask you for a feedback. You guys have already provided great feedback in multiple occasions
[03:51:35] <pedro-delfino> We are going to launch an YouTube channel called “Nyxt Academy”
[03:51:49] <pedro-delfino> The idea is to record short tutorials showcasing Nyxt
[03:52:11] <edgarvincent[m]> That's excellent news!
[03:52:15] <pedro-delfino> It is not intended to be the main source of documentation (this would be the manual)
[03:52:23] <waleee> edgarvincent[m]: aha, so the build error could be because eg it didn't find a function located in https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/build-scripts/sync-submodules-with-guix.scm ?
[03:52:27] <pedro-delfino> It is more like a marketing effort
[03:52:41] <pedro-delfino> This is an advanced pilot video:
[03:52:45] <pedro-delfino> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIjKIBy2z4A
[03:53:05] <pedro-delfino> I will be recording a new version similar to this one
[03:53:14] <edgarvincent[m]> waleee: could well be!
[03:53:56] <pedro-delfino> It would be cool to see your impressions. Comments specific to this video would be nice. But also comments on the general concept of the project
[03:54:05] <pedro-delfino> Hopefully, a new video every month for 2022
[03:55:06] <pedro-delfino> edgarvincent[m]: thanks for the support! :)
[03:55:47] <waleee> pedro-delfino: that would complement some of the blog articles available nicely (eg https://ag91.github.io/blog/'s post on nyxt)
[03:56:08] <pedro-delfino> Exactly
[03:56:43] <edgarvincent[m]> It's bed time here, but this sounds very exciting. I'll watch the video tomorrow and gather my thoughts.
[03:57:14] <edgarvincent[m]> I need to do some writing myself about Nyxt but I'm being too slow.
[03:57:29] <pedro-delfino>  Oool. It is 9PM in Brazil. Sometimes I forget most of you guys are in Europe
[03:57:46] <pedro-delfino> Jing is probably having breakfast now haha

[13:40:55] <qhong> Turns out that new webkitgtk just doesn't build on macOS. Not just configuration problem, real code changes required, sigh
[13:44:21] <qhong> Is it possible to make a renderer using macOS's own webkit? Not so familiar with browser engines.
[13:44:45] <qhong> will libraries/web-extensions/* keep working for macOS's own webkit?
[14:30:19] <aartaka> qhong: no, libraries/webextensions is GTK-dependent. Nyxt itself implies a C interface that GTK provides. To interop with MacOS own WebKit, we'd need to write a hella lot of Objective-C and bind it in C :/
[14:37:42] <qhong> rip
[14:38:06] <qhong> fwiw, emacs-webkit has both an webkitgtk impl and a native NSWebKit impl
[14:39:02] <qhong> it's interface is fairly limited though. the only thing it can do is basically evaluate javascript
[15:05:30] <pjb> aartaka: usually, cocoa provides Core API which are pure C APIs.
[15:05:31] <Kabouik> Pretty cool pedro-delfino, I think it'd be pretty useful to both current users and to attract new users. I believe other topics to cover in the future, because new users will probably look for info on then when starting using Nyxt are: how to configure Nyxt (simple and practical examples using init.lisp and how to create a custom command or keybinding, highlight-regexp for instance), theming, ad-blocking
[15:06:19] <pedro-delfino> Kabouik: thanks for the feedback!
[15:07:33] <Kabouik> When there's a bigger use-base and more viewers, it could be nice to do some short Q&A for like 10-20 min for instance, in live, to cover individual issues. I'm not sure about this one because it would be kind of a hotline and could well get out of control if people ask too specific things, but on the other hand it could be a way to cover real case issues and have the video available later one when others ask the same on the forum or here
[15:09:07] <Kabouik> Could be semi-live too, picking issues raised on Github/forum/IRC that you deem relevant for a clarification in a video
[15:17:11] <Kabouik> Didn't you all sometimes face this issue where you use follow-hint, but the prompt-buffer is hiding the web content and the hints you want to follow because they are on the bottom of the page?
[15:18:16] <Kabouik> The command jmercouris helped configuring to expand or shrink the prompt-buffer is really useful with it, I can see it even more now that my touch input no longer work on the phone and I have to use hints all the time.
[15:18:49] <Kabouik> This very issue of prompt-buffer hiding content and hints makes me wonder if it shouldn't be a default command

[16:04:44] <edgarvincent[m]> Is there no way around this? Like centering the search candidate like Emacs' consult-line does?
[16:17:35] <florhizome[m]> Does nyxt have some way of handling inactive buffers?
[16:18:09] <Kabouik> I don't think so edgarvincent[m], it's just in my dotfiles repo at the moment, and it's not perfect yet: when I expxand the prompt buffer, there's a certain height above which the scrollable list of commands is no longer expanded. I imagine it's just some css to add to make the overflow-y depend on the current size of the prompt-buffer, but not sure how to do it.
[16:18:44] <Kabouik> Expanding the prompt-buffer does show more of the scrollable list than the default size, but there's just a limit
[16:19:13] <edgarvincent[m]> pdelfino: Thanks for the video. As I said yesterday, I think that's a very good idea. A few (superficial) remarks:
[16:19:14] <edgarvincent[m]> - It might be better to describe what you are actually doing with a little more detail: what keybindings you are using, what happens when you press them, etc. It doesn't have to be very thorough or systematic, because it is not the purpose of the video, but I think quick reminders (pressing `M-x`, how to select multiple candidates in the prompt buffer, etc.) would help users. David Wilson from System Crafters does that, and I think it is useful.
[16:19:14] <edgarvincent[m]> - I personally don't care about it at all, but I think some users would: you might want to find a way to improve the sound quality, and possibly make it louder.
[16:19:14] <edgarvincent[m]> - At 4:22, the sentence should be gender-neutral: "The user can easily find what's relevant for them".
[16:19:17] <florhizome[m]> I heard edge has become pretty good at that, putting them in some kind of sleep mode.
[16:20:14] <edgarvincent[m]> Kabouik: I see, thanks.
[16:20:16] <Kabouik> what keybindings you are using > there's a software that shows an overlay of the keypresses, that would be useful indeed.
[16:21:09] <Kabouik> People can then stop the video to understand what's happening
[16:21:22] <edgarvincent[m]> I think it would help to say them out loud as well. Sometimes, overlays appear in short succession, which makes the whole thing a little confusing.
[16:21:36] <florhizome[m]> Also the newer Firefox releases have addressed that as i remember. But for webkitgtk browsers i haven't heard of the possibilities.
[16:21:57] <edgarvincent[m]> Not necessarily every time they are used, but possibly the first few times.
[16:22:09] <Kabouik> Yeah, those are not mutually exclusive edgarvincent[m].
[16:22:17] <edgarvincent[m]> yup :)
[16:23:17] <Kabouik> Since Nyxt has several keybinding schemes, if they are voiced out loud, perhaps it's a good idea to first say once in the video which scheme is being used in that particular config.
[16:24:52] <edgarvincent[m]> Indeed.
[16:25:25] <edgarvincent[m]> ^pdelfino
[16:31:19] <edgarvincent[m]> Also, again I personally don't care much about this, but viewers might like a more "streamlined" video, with consistent illustrations and so on. Would be nice to have a standard presentation template, possibly themed similarly to the Nyxt website.
[16:34:44] <Kabouik> I think it's important though to keep it simple and easy to make so that it doesn't become a burden every month.
[16:51:43] <edgarvincent[m]> True. I don't think it needs to be particularly sophisticated, though. Perhaps a simple org-mode outline in Emacs without any specific theming?
[17:06:28] <aartaka> edgarvincent[m]: I've dug into doing Beamer templates for Org outiles recently, what a coincidence :)
[17:06:42] <aartaka> *outlines.
[17:06:44] <edgarvincent[m]> :)
[17:07:25] <edgarvincent[m]> A Nyxt-themed one would be brilliant - I'd love to give a hand, not sure when I'll have the time, though.
[17:07:57] <edgarvincent[m]> (it could be a very simple one with a Nyxt logo header and the "Nyxt blue" colour accent)

[18:07:02] <cennedy> yeah?
[18:11:33] <Kabouik> I think Nyxt itself won't collect anything, so then it really depends on your use and the websites and search engines you use cennedy
[18:12:15] <cennedy> oh ok
[18:12:20] *** Joins: xaltsc (~xaltsc@user/xaltsc)
[18:12:22] <cennedy> and which is faster?
[18:12:23] <Kabouik> There's a no-script mode in Nyxt, which should block some of the tracking scripts, and you could combine that with dns filterint like Nextdns
[18:12:48] <Kabouik> But Chromium of course will have extensions like uBlock which can be handy too
[18:13:27] <cennedy> wait
[18:13:32] <Kabouik> For me Nyxt is slow on cluttered websites, but no-script mode does help, which says a lot about the number of scripts that run in the background
[18:13:35] <cennedy> hmm
[18:13:44] <Kabouik> On other websites it's fine
[18:13:48] <cennedy> like youtube?
[18:13:52] <cennedy> faster or not
[18:14:32] <Kabouik> I think Chromium will be faster on youtube, but I use ytfzf and mpv to play Youtube videos, best way to keep it private and untracked
[18:14:51] <Kabouik> ytfzf even allows subscriptions without using a Google account
[18:15:12] <cennedy> oh holy s*** like newpipe on android

[18:20:10] <cennedy> i dont need the advanced browser
[18:20:29] <cennedy> i dont because i use yt in discord and i can use surf browser?
[18:20:41] <Kabouik> You can also customize keybindings with it: ctrl-y plays in mpv for me, return plays sound only, ctrl-s downloads the video, another one just copies the url, and another one opens mpv and closes the terminal while playing so there's only one window
[18:21:11] <Kabouik> Those are custom bindings but you can do what you want in the config file

[18:21:32] <cennedy> have a doc about customization
[18:21:54] <Kabouik> In general, regardless of ytfzf, I think other people have configured Nyxt so that it directly plays Youtube videos in mpv

[22:42:30] <opalvaults[m]> jmercouris: Any way I can help with web extensions? I've always wanted to create web extensions in lisp
[22:43:11] <opalvaults[m]> I think I've read that a couple individuals were looking into porting the functionality of ublock origin to Nyxt
[22:46:28] <aartaka> opalvaults[m]: jmercouris meant the support for boring JS-based extensions from Chromium/Firefox. Right now we do it through our own C library plugged into WebKitGTK and communicating with the browser. If you still want to help with this, see libraries/web-extensions README and code comments (it's somewhat outdated, but the main idea is still relevant) in Nyxt source tree.
[22:46:44] <opalvaults[m]> Man this browser is so rad it's so easy to deck it out in functionality.
[22:47:48] <opalvaults[m]> aartaka: is Parenscript supported since it I believe compiled to javascript bytecode?
[22:48:02] <opalvaults[m]> Sorta like Hy compiles down to PythonVM code iirc
[22:49:35] <aartaka> opalvaults[m]: Parenscript is supported, yes. It compiles to JS code, not bytecode, though. See `define-parenscript` and `pflet` macros for quick Nyxt-native Parenscript usage :)
[22:50:52] <aartaka> opalvaults[m]: Adding to that, we define a small set of Parenscript macros ourselves, see source/parenscript-macro.lisp for those.
[22:51:16] <opalvaults[m]> thanks for the information aartaka ! I will take a look at that. and also thanks for the correction, i obviously need to read up on parenscript capability. It'd be really great to have extensions that you can reach in the mode-line similar to how extensions can be put in the toolbar in icecat
[22:52:17] <aartaka> opalvaults[m]: That's already the case with WebExtensions support.
[22:52:43] <aartaka> It's just terribly undocumented and work in progress in general.
[22:53:34] <opalvaults[m]> Well maybe I can make up for my lack of programming skills with writing documentation. Let me know if there's any place you think could use some TLC and I'll try and dive in. Quiet week at work and all that
[22:58:20] <aartaka> opalvaults[m]: if you're interested in how one can interact with the page in Lisp, I suggest you take a look as source/dom.lisp, source/parenscript-macro.lisp, source/element-hints.lisp and try to put your intuition about these page interaction models into a manual section. Our manual is too small for all the features Nyxt has, so we'll be glad to accept any manual update/expansion :)
[22:59:47] <aartaka> opalvaults[m]: regarding Parenscript understanding: Parenscript reference manual is extremely well-structured, so you can start from there.
[23:03:22] <opalvaults[m]> awesome! thanks for all the helpful info. i've cloned the repo and i'll start hacking at it.
[23:03:37] <opalvaults[m]> aartaka: are you a maintainer or a developer?
[23:03:58] <opalvaults[m]> (or both for the project)
[23:25:05] <aartaka> opalvaults[m]: I don't exactly get the difference between the two, but I guess I'm both :)
[23:30:40] <opalvaults[m]> interesting point. I think i know a couple of maintainers that don't actively develop but do the usual schtick of managing repositories and merging pull requests/monitoring ci/cd. maybe my circle is too small :P

[23:48:30] <jmercouris> aartaka: I'm going to ask about the compilation on #commonlisp
[23:48:41] <jmercouris> it seems odd to me that the perform compile step is structured as it is
[23:48:59] <aartaka> jmercouris: what's wrong with the step?
[23:49:20] <jmercouris> aartaka: I swear there is a different way
[23:49:28] <jmercouris> another better way
[23:49:35] <aartaka> jmervouris: Makefile xD
[23:49:35] <jmercouris> anyways, I am getting these unexplainable compilation errors
[23:49:41] <jmercouris> aartaka: I don't mean a makefile 11
[23:49:54] <jmercouris> in case you are curious what spurred this search: https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/1957
[23:50:01] <aartaka> jmercouris: So do I. There should be a better way, I hope.
[23:50:37] <jmercouris> aartaka: you are also getting those compilation errors?
[23:50:46] <jmercouris> hm, I wonder what it is
[23:50:58] <jmercouris> somehow the environment is different or something, I don't know
[23:51:15] <jmercouris> I also don't have a PKG_CONFIG_PATH configured by my Nix shell
[23:51:45] <aartaka> jmercouris: in my case it's pkg-config returning 1 even when PKG_CONFIG_PATH is perfect.
[23:53:19] <aartaka> jmercouris: Exactly the same error as your issue happens on Guix. And I can run the command in the shell too, with no errors.
[23:54:02] <jmercouris> aartaka: that is the most strange tomato
[23:54:12] <jmercouris> perhaps there is an invisible symbol or something
[23:54:19] <jmercouris> that is somehow finding its way into the run command
[23:54:29] <jmercouris> I don't know, I guess this is something to investigate for later
[23:54:54] <jmercouris> for now I will start working off of ceed6f1b782e37caac5d939b37f48ce242e874f7
[23:54:58] <jmercouris> which is the last commit that worked for me
[23:55:18] <aartaka> jmercouris: Yes, it's something about uiop:run-program, because everything is perfect before it runs.
[23:55:51] <jmercouris> indeed, indeed
[23:56:09] <jmercouris> I spent like 3 hours today tryin to figure it out :-D
[23:56:15] <jmercouris> well, it wasn't meant to be it seems
[23:56:21] <jmercouris> not today Batman
[23:56:25] <jmercouris> not today...
[23:57:35] <aartaka> jmercouris: the commit you referenced fails the same for me.
