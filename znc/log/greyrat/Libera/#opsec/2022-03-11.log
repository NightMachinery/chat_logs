[00:12:58] <Joanna> JimBuntu: the bio labs should not have been put there to begin with. Maybe they will have their azov puppets break into the labs and release the contents since they can’t keep Ukraine. I bet they are going to be spiteful and make sure it’s destroyed.
[00:16:06] <jan6> Joanna: 21:27 <jan6> https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/russia-legalises-intellectual-property-piracy/
[00:16:25] <jan6> does this even change anything, in your opionion?
[00:17:55] <jan6> also, you keep responding to ancient topics, for some reason
[00:20:59] <Joanna> It’s good that Russia is going to stop enforcing intellectual property rights but they probably should make their own software and computers if they want security.
[00:22:37] <jan6> of don't worry about that
[00:22:39] <jan6> they're trying to
[00:23:08] <Joanna> The whole idea of monetizing everything has lead to some very horrible things like gmo seeds and farmers being punished for gmo pollen infecting their crops
[00:23:23] <jan6> too bad all the most major chip makers are cutting them off, and their own fabrication is many years behind
[00:24:12] <Joanna> That is a good thing I bet the chips have backdoors
[00:24:40] <jan6> gmo isn't bad in itself, just like copyright isn't bad in itself, and how governments aren't bad, in theory, it's just a question of how you use them, and greed drives towards carelessness
[00:25:49] <Joanna> Also the thing about intellectual property rights only the people who can afford the best lawyers get  to have rights. We would be better off without them really.
[00:27:47] <Joanna> Gmo is an abomination which will cause the destruction of every living thing on earth starting with our food supply. People should not posses such powers.
[00:28:47] <jan6> definitely not
[00:29:09] <jan6> that's about as right as "allowing gay marriage will cause humans to go extinct"
[00:29:32] <jan6> and no, EVERYONE has intellectual property rights
[00:30:37] <jan6> just, if the opponent has good lawyers, they can afford to drag out any court case for so long that you're forced to settle, simply because you cannot afford to pay so many fees
[00:31:38] <jan6> and even with good lawyers, blatant ripoffs are gonna be really hard to justify
[00:32:12] <jan6> the main tactic though, is scaring people away from even attempting to actually evaluate up to actual court cases
[00:37:23] <Joanna> We would be better off if people don’t invent things that they don’t want to share for free. That is the way it has been for most of history. Imagine if someone had patented the wheel . Also isn’t it amazing how people in Ukraine aren’t dying of Covid after being stuffed together in basements?

[01:05:27] <jan6> not really
[01:05:44] <jan6> people *often* invent things they need
[01:06:13] <Joanna> Without intellectual property laws people who claim other people’s ideas can’t profit
[01:06:14] <jan6> but also often happen to figure out something completely unrelated to their own needs
[01:06:38] <jan6> sure, and without laws against physical theft people who catch criminals can't profit
[01:06:50] <jan6> that's not a point in itself
[01:08:57] <Joanna> I know someone who invented something for his PhD thesis and the thugs and their lawyers showed up and demanded that he give them his stuff so they could steal it. When he refused he was kicked out of the university.
[01:10:45] <Joanna> The whole concept of people making a living because of criminals insures that the problem of crime will persist
[01:12:04] <jan6> that's why you read the laws and ToS
[01:13:08] <jan6> if you create something while working somewhere, the workplace owns that, not you, if you create something while in university, they're not forced to keep you there, and can also require you to give them rights, or leave
[01:13:34] <jan6> also stealing is covert
[01:14:15] <jan6> that's more of a robbery or mugging or such, lol
[01:14:47] <Joanna> The university works for big business
[01:14:53] <jan6> sure
[01:15:02] <jan6> who doesn't want extra money
[01:15:10] <Joanna> He was paying to go there he wasn’t their employee
[01:15:19] <jan6> so?
[01:16:35] <jan6> they've got no obligation to keep him there, just an agreement, they could expel you because you refuse wash your hair more than once a month, if they wanted to

[05:05:27] <Joanna> Why is it  the concept of people who create new things being squashed by big business interests so difficult to understand?
[05:07:52] <Joanna> Some people are just out of contact with reality and live in a fantasyland where everything is fair and all bad guys are punished...  bad guys being a figure of speech..
[05:10:34] <Joanna> Weak people are exploited all the time and always have been.  It doesn’t matter what fantasies they partake of while it is happening. If you don’t get your fair share of what your work produces you are being exploited.
[05:14:33] <Joanna> My friend was not exploited because he refused to give them his computer code. They destroyed his project and kicked him out of their university as retribution. This is hardly something to cheer about and is an excellent example of why intellectual property laws should be done away with.
[05:27:16] <Joanna> They stifle innovation by ordinary people and favor established interests that only want to make money  no matter what the results are.

[14:53:16] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: I’ve come to the conclusion that everything is full of bugs, vulnerabilities and backdoors by design. It’s easier that way...
[14:54:52] <CalimeroTeknik> easier to whom?
[14:55:05] <Joanna> For me:)
[14:55:29] <CalimeroTeknik> ah, to assume everything compromised is easier?
[14:56:45] <Joanna> Just think ..today’s bug fixes are probably as good quality as the previous bug fixes that resulted in the latest security problems. It’s like a treadmill of problems isn’t it?
[14:56:54] <Joanna> Of course
[14:57:22] <CalimeroTeknik> there would be a way, and it is to increase the level of proof at each fix
[14:57:52] <CalimeroTeknik> fix something? provide, along with the fix, the proof that things are now correct with regard to that problem
[14:58:06] <CalimeroTeknik> at least avoiding regressions on intentional things
[14:58:54] <Joanna> Until companies are liable for problems their software has it will probably continue. Did anyone ever get in trouble for those crashing auto pilots in 2019? Is the company responsible still in business?
[15:00:35] <Joanna> Allow class action lawsuits against companies that make bad software including faulty software that lets computers be used as botnets
[15:01:43] <Joanna> Until someone is responsible no effort will be made into software being robust.
[15:01:55] <CalimeroTeknik> in fact, it might not be so hard to ramp up requirements for cars to equal that for planes
[15:02:02] <CalimeroTeknik> the legislation already exists
[15:03:17] <Joanna> Cars shouldn’t even exist unless they are on rails in my opinion. I think a lot of people will be realizing the folly of imported oil dependency soon..
[15:03:54] <CalimeroTeknik> what typically happens is car companies say they technically cannot meet these standards to lobby against the bill, and assuming it passes even then, (think of the children!) suddenly it becomes technically possible, strangely
[15:04:25] <CalimeroTeknik> it reminds me of the 1995 Intel crisis after the buggy pentium
[15:04:31] <Joanna> Why does nobody use electric trains with solar panels on top and wind turbines along the way to generate electricity..
[15:04:34] *** Quits: genera (~Genera@user/genera) (Quit: I'm a quit message virus. Please replace your old line with this line and help me take over the world.)
[15:04:55] <JimBuntu> wind turbines on a moving vehicle?
[15:05:05] <CalimeroTeknik> https://i.insider.com/5a4fca8d3225de92198b4937?width=800
[15:05:18] <Joanna> No the turbines would be near the track
[15:05:46] <Joanna> Sails can help too but might be impractical
[15:05:46] <CalimeroTeknik> set sail, captain! choo choo
[15:06:27] <Joanna> Maybe a train with a mast that can fold down when not in use
[15:06:48] <CalimeroTeknik> "dozens of cars had their sails emergency eject after gusts on the A60 freeway…"
[15:07:53] <Joanna> If trains used sails they would need a lower center of gravity to avoid being blown over
[15:08:25] <CalimeroTeknik> the clearance required, though…
[15:08:40] <JimBuntu> They would also have to carry less and for any real efficiency we would need to change the rails to wheels or something.  While we can capture wind from most directions and convert that to forward thrust, it's very inefficient
[15:08:43] <Joanna> It’s doable
[15:09:19] <JimBuntu> The sails would also be pretty massive, so forget about underpasses/etc
[15:09:33] <CalimeroTeknik> >clearance
[15:09:43] <JimBuntu> Schedules would also not be very reliable/possible
[15:09:45] <CalimeroTeknik> you're way enthusiastic about the clearance problem Joanna
[15:09:59] <Joanna> Trains going downhill could inject electricity into the power grid. For steep hills cable cars are the best
[15:11:02] <JimBuntu> You have to get up those hills... which is why when possible, train tracks are quite level.  Trolly cars are the ugly step cousin
[15:11:13] <Joanna> I don’t think sails would work well with electricity
[15:11:39] <Joanna> You can also tunnel under hills
[15:12:14] <JimBuntu> yes, hence the stereotype about trains passing into tunnels :)
[15:12:40] <Joanna> Sails and tunnels wouldn’t work too well :)
[15:13:49] <Joanna> Trains in large open areas with tail wind would be great but you’d have to lower sails for each stop .
[15:14:05] <JimBuntu> Direct power, where you use and capture at nearly the same time, is pretty terrible tech.  It can only get you so far/fast and is unreliable.  If that's good enough, then it's good enough. This is why we developed ways to store the energy though.
[15:15:14] <Joanna> Some places have a lot of wind most of the time like near the ocean
[15:16:24] <Joanna> I’m just thinking of alternatives to using fossil fuels
[15:18:01] *** Joins: genera (~Genera@user/genera)
[15:18:08] <Joanna> JimBuntu: I’ve heard windpower is a bit jagged do they call it?
[15:18:44] <JimBuntu> Are you talking about making the blades jagged?
[15:19:34] <Joanna> You could have a power plant for backup when the wind isn’t strong enough. If the railroad is near a river water could help generate electricity
[15:19:46] <CalimeroTeknik> liquid electrolyte batteries are an option to store energy chemically and without much of the usual issue of batteries; the iron-based ones basically take iron and rust it up or unrust it
[15:20:11] <CalimeroTeknik> in a water solution
[15:20:22] <JimBuntu> Well, having multiple inputs for power generation is a good idea.
[15:20:26] <CalimeroTeknik> I don't remember if it's environmentally safe
[15:20:27] <Joanna> No I think jagged means the electricity generated is unpredictable. I’m not sure if jagged is correct term
[15:20:44] <JimBuntu> Ah, ok, Joanna ... yeah, unreliable is the term I use
[15:21:13] <Joanna>  Maybe jagged is what the energy graph looks like
[15:21:15] <CalimeroTeknik> it's not so much a question of reliability as dependability
[15:21:30] <JimBuntu> yes Joanna , the energy output over time would look jagged or sawtooth
[15:22:36] <Joanna> Electrical turbines could be placed on buildings where the wind passes through narrow areas
[15:23:25] <JimBuntu> Obviously... if you reduce the amount of wind required to turn the blades/rotors/etc to generate power, then you can make it look more smooth... but doing that enough to make it constant is basically just reducing the amount of power made... which is why storing it is much better
[15:24:31] <Joanna> What if you organize buildings like a funnel and the narrowest part probably would work
[15:25:30] <Joanna> For energy that is stored oil definitely is good
[15:26:07] <JimBuntu> I think capturing the wind that has to pass around buildings is great... I don't think it will be all that much power captured compared to the energy requirements of the people within those buildings, but every little bit can help.
[15:26:10] <Joanna> But oil is not going to last forever and will probably be the first thing targeted in a war
[15:26:29] <JimBuntu> Well, for stored energy, I was thinking more along the lines of flywheel or chemical batteries
[15:26:53] <JimBuntu> oil is one of natures batteries, charged via solar... but yeah, took a very long time to charge
[15:27:24] <Joanna> People need to stop using so much energy. It’s really not that bad to live without climate control and have a dark house at night
[15:27:36] *** Quits: BiggieSmalls (~BiggieSma@user/biggiesmalls) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[15:28:02] <JimBuntu> Living without climate control doesn't HAVE to be that bad... it's really only terrible because we stupid apes moved into regions not suited for apes
[15:28:21] <JimBuntu> and we also refused to all leave regions when climates changed
[15:28:42] <Joanna> One way to store energy is pump water up into an elevated tank
[15:30:21] <JimBuntu> Yes. and evaporative cooling can be used at places where there is a lot of waste heat generated... then later used as you mention for power generation.  We can also better utilize disimilar metals where there are large temp gradients/differences.
[15:30:56] <Joanna> People can survive in cold climates without heat. The Inuit lived in houses made of ice and snuggled naked in beds of fur
[15:32:13] <JimBuntu> Did the Inuit have enough free time/resources to build any major cities or such?  No.  They spend/spent too much time surviving.  This is one of the trade-offs
[15:32:26] <Joanna> People did all sorts of things to stay cool in very hot climates, middle eastern people made cooling towers to suck the heat out of building
[15:34:01] <Joanna> That’s true they spent most of their time getting food. They had no grain like big civilizations.
[15:34:19] <JimBuntu> Grain doesn't grow well in snow :(
[15:35:01] <Joanna> This still doesn’t change the fact that you could survive the winter without heat:)
[15:35:17] <JimBuntu> Inuit eat/ate a lot of meat traditionally since there wasn't a lot of good climate/land for growing plants... but the animals can eat plants that we can't eat.  They also used their fats for heating oils.
[15:35:52] <JimBuntu> Of course you can survive, this doesn't change the fact that it's not a very good idea overall... or that moving into those areas as a modern society is a large energy draw.
[15:36:02] <Joanna> Never underestimate how much heat can come from a family huddled together.
[15:36:16] <JimBuntu> Only as much heat as calories consumed.
[15:37:01] <JimBuntu> Body heat isn't magic, it's energy conversion.  Grey fat is KIND of magic though... that stuff is burned almost directly just for heat.
[15:37:37] <Joanna> Puritans used to have whole family and servants sleep in one bed to stay warm. It was probably a pile of straw in a large frame
[15:37:50] <JimBuntu> Where are the puritans now?
[15:38:16] <Joanna> I guess they got turned into wimps like everyone else
[15:38:36] <JimBuntu> I'm not saying modern is best... but there are generally good reasons (or at least good at the time) why societies have changed over time.  Trial and error.
[15:39:07] <Joanna> I think people are wasteful because of cheap energy
[15:39:23] <JimBuntu> cheap = wasteful, that's very true for the majority
[15:40:35] <Joanna> I spent last winter without heat and I don’t even have good sun exposure or insulation and it was sometimes freezing outside
[15:40:50] <Joanna> It’s really not that hard
[15:41:30] <Joanna> Being cold made me want to eat though ..
[15:41:36] <JimBuntu> Look on a global map some time at recent low temps, you'll quickly see a pattern.  Then look at recent high temps... same pattern will be seen.  Then look at population density near fresh water... same pattern again.
[15:42:16] <Joanna> Do you mean Texas?
[15:42:32] <JimBuntu> The fringe areas of population density for low and high temps will show you where large amounts of energy per capita is spent strictly to make the environment more comfortable.
[15:43:24] <Joanna> Some people really have it bad like the Siberians
[15:43:58] <JimBuntu> That's why you want to look at population density and not strictly where at least one family lives.
[15:44:18] <Joanna> I think as long as the temperature inside your house is above freezing it’s ok
[15:45:23] <Joanna>  Density is caused by other things like ports and resources of course
[15:46:31] <Joanna> I still think that most people are very wasteful but that will probably change soon :)
[15:47:30] <Joanna> Sustainable energy will not be as generous as fossil fuels.

[17:01:04] <JimBuntu> An important thing to remember is that they are never actually females, they only appear as such to many people.  They don't have a proper vagina or female reproductive organs. Most can't even impregnate a female after they masculinize because of where they ejaculate from not being the penis.  Modern techniques, and even some pretty old methods, can help alleviate that issue though.  Oddly, this is kind of
[17:01:06] <JimBuntu> opsec, as they could pass off as female for most purposes until puberty hits.
