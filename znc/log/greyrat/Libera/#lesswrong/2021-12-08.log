[04:00:10] <kuudes> it would be interesting to check if that has anything that notes it could not have been done within 1-2 weeks
[04:00:31] <kuudes> you know, omicron has been known only for that long
[04:00:45] <kuudes> and they say they have done multiple 3 day steps

[04:11:47] <kuudes> I think I misunderstand, but for my reading the minimum time would come to 17 2/3 days? I guess some steps must be parallel?
[04:12:39] <kuudes> and it is at tops 16 days since discovery of omicron? tuesday 2021-11-23?

[08:03:18] <shawwwn> apparently I dramatically overestimated SF's ability to keep its city life open into the evening
[08:03:27] <shawwwn> most shops close at 7:00
[08:03:36] <shawwwn> subway certainly isn't this late
[08:03:43] <shawwwn> ]
[08:04:01] <shawwwn> I searched for "food" on google maps and got Dave's food store
[08:04:07] <shawwwn> expecting something resembling a grocery store
[08:04:15] <shawwwn> it was functionally equivalent to a gas station, minus the gas
[08:04:35] <shawwwn> so I bought three cans of clam chowder plus a thing of beef jerky for $12
[08:04:44] <shawwwn> cash only, which I had to withdraw from the ATM for $2.50
[08:04:56] <shawwwn> I don't mind it, it's just interesting that even in SF there's shops that won't take cards
[08:05:16] <shawwwn> on my way back I found a little place that was named something followed by "Wraps", and their meat lovers looked good
[08:05:25] <shawwwn> so I went to go in, and the door was locked
[08:05:40] <shawwwn> the shop owner came up and unlocked the door and I said sorry, are you open? he said yes, he locks the door for safety
[08:06:33] <shawwwn> so I got my delicious meat lover's wrap and started eating it on the way home, and it went all over my beard because I was ravenously hungry
[08:06:47] <shawwwn> thought I'd try to fit in with the way everyone else on the street looked, y'know?
[08:07:06] <shawwwn> all in all, nice tuesday.

[08:10:52] <shawwwn> firstly, it's $16, which is completely reasonable given how gigantic it is
[08:11:12] <shawwwn> it's in a thicc flour wrap which doesn't disintegrate (+1 for that)
[08:11:22] <shawwwn> filled with sour cream, beef, and onions
[08:11:41] <shawwwn> surprisingly I like the onions, and I don't usually

[10:49:41] <quanticle> feep: Did I join before or after you?
[10:49:57] <kuudes> they must really believe hard that getting ill is the benefit of the children
[10:50:21] <kuudes> they claim it does not spread in schools between children, but that children get infected by their parents
[10:50:30] <quanticle> That seems dubious

[10:51:37] <quanticle> I'm not even getting dose 3 until December 16
[10:51:45] <kuudes> I tried to get my kids vaccine with a prescription, but was turned away second time
[10:52:03] <kuudes> even though currently it is common knowledge that the statute will be changed in a week so that they will be eligible
[10:52:42] * quanticle just got a 50-pack of N95s, just in case
[10:52:51] <kuudes> and the nurses were very sympathetic because the area where I got my vaccine in, has even more spread, as there are religious large families there
[10:52:57] <feep> quanticle: I have missing logs between 2010 and 2013

[10:55:11] <saturn2> do you know any pharmacists?
[10:55:17] <feep[work]> yeah omicron is gonna be exponential 2: exponential harder
[10:56:22] <kuudes> saturn2, yeah. but the vaccine is not in pharmacies here
[10:56:30] <kuudes> it is only on local governments
[10:56:46] <saturn2> oh :(
[10:56:49] <kuudes> I know multiple doctors; some of them work on vaccine delivery
[10:56:58] <kuudes> and I have pleaded for them to vaccinate my kids
[10:57:03] <kuudes> but they are afraid
[10:57:08] <feep[work]> oh sweet, it's the space jam part of this mix
[10:57:14] * feep[work] turns up the volume
[10:57:19] <feep[work]> music is weird now.
[10:57:22] <kuudes> I have also offered that we can inject the kids ourselves, we just need the physical substance
[10:58:02] <kuudes> this is legible state gone insane :-(
[10:58:30] <saturn2> i suppose this is the downside to living in a highly ordered society
[10:58:35] <kuudes> indeed
[10:58:46] <kuudes> I put my hope in that they change the statute in a week or 2
[10:59:01] <kuudes> we are lucky that I am ill so my kids get the dose then
[10:59:08] <kuudes> it will still not be given to general kids then
[10:59:19] <kuudes> so my sister's kid won't get it
[11:00:01] <saturn2> i wonder if anyone's selling vaccine on the darknet
[11:00:41] <kuudes> indeed
[11:01:10] <kuudes> I mean, I could try to fly with my kids to wien, they vaccinate everyone there also without locale
[11:01:27] <kuudes> but it seems much more complicated and risky to travel than to wait for the week
[11:01:30] <feep[work]> yeah
[11:01:41] <kuudes> so I guess waiting locked in is the best course of action

[11:17:06] <Guest87678> I like it though, I often eat chips while walking outside (helps with anxiety maybe?) and the hand washing soaps help wash it off

[11:23:29] <ggreer> it's so weird to go between vancouver and portland. downtown vancouver is rather paranoid about covid stuff (people wear masks indoors) but otherwise everyone has gone back to normal. portland has people wearing masks outside with nobody around them
[11:24:09] <spxtr> ggreer: driving through downtown SF was similar. I saw probably 30-40 people walking outside, all wearing masks
[11:24:26] <spxtr> only one or two without, and I think they were experiencing homelessness
[11:24:55] <kuudes> huh, second minister here has got infected even though they have been vaccinated
[11:25:04] <ggreer> "experiencing homelessness"? is that the new euphemism for "bum"?
[11:25:16] <spxtr> not exactly new
[11:25:36] <ggreer> my favorite one is "houseless"
[11:25:45] <ggreer> like.... do people who live in condos count as houseless?
[11:26:11] <spxtr> I hate that there is such strong pressure to own homes in America
[11:26:14] <saturn2> don't call it poverty, it's experiencing moneylessness
[11:26:24] <spxtr> own houses*
[11:26:45] <ggreer> owning is kinda convenient. you can make lots of modifications that a landlord would refuse
[11:27:04] <spxtr> that's true, and you can have loud hobbies and parties and the like without pissing off your neighbors
[11:27:09] <spxtr> there are many advantages
[11:27:10] <ggreer> redo the cabinets in the kitchen. replace the flooring with your favorite kind. paint everything your favorite colors. etc
[11:27:51] <Guest87678> it's weird that soundproofing is still a problem with even new apartments, i know nothing of engineering but i would've thought that's not a hard problem
[11:28:01] <ggreer> it's an easy problem. it just costs more
[11:28:21] <kuudes> over here new apartments are much better than old, mostly because regulations
[11:28:37] <spxtr> Guest87678: I've stayed in an apartment with excellent soundproofing before. It's doable, just needs thick walls.
[11:28:39] <ggreer> I own a condo and my shared walls transmit no noise. I guess the walls are concrete with some dampening or something
[11:29:00] <saturn2> i believe it's actually getting worse here
[11:29:15] <quanticle> saturn2: I'm not single, I'm just "experiencing girlfriendlessness"
[11:29:42] <spxtr> surely this isn't the first time y'all are hearing the phrase "experiencing homelessness" no? been living under rocks?
[11:29:58] <saturn2> in the 70s-00s most new construction was steel framed concrete, but now they've switched everything to that engineered wood stuff
[11:30:12] <saturn2> spxtr: i have
[11:30:29] <quanticle> I've heard the term "homeless" before, but I think this is the first time I've ever heard of a person referred to as "experiencing homelessness". Usually it's "homeless person"
[11:31:28] <quanticle> ggreer: Yeah, the first thing I did when I bought my townhouse was to repaint the walls and redo the flooring
[11:31:38] <ggreer> nice
[11:31:41] <quanticle> I left the cabinets because I'm lazy and cheap
[11:33:14] <quanticle> spxtr: Well, to a certain extent. I live in a townhouse, so I can't be super loud without pissing off my neighbors. Can certainly be louder than if I lived in an apartment, though.
[11:34:02] <quanticle> saturn2: Engineered wood is worse for soundproofing than steel-framed concrete?
[11:34:03] <saturn2> can you explain what the point of a townhouse is?
[11:34:08] <saturn2> yes
[11:34:25] <quanticle> More space than an apartment, but you don't have to shovel your driveway or mow your lawn
[11:34:35] <saturn2> i see
[11:34:41] <spxtr> townhouses are higher density housing than single-family, but you still get a big enough place for a family plus your own door
[11:34:52] <spxtr> I quite like them
[11:35:44] <quanticle> Or, in my case, have a big enough place to lord it over group-house dwelling rats

[11:40:52] <saturn2> it's possible that the average wealth of the homeless is now higher than the non-homeless
[11:41:10] <rsaarelm> I've had this idea of "if you're rich enough, you don't want to own a house". All sorts of recurring and potential maintenance responsibilities you don't necessarily care at all about when you do own a house. Just live in hotels or whatever.
[11:41:29] <rsaarelm> Not universal, but definitely applies to some type of person.
[11:41:30] <Guest87678> saturn2: because rural people own more homes?
[11:41:33] <kuudes> well yes, a building is a risk
[11:41:44] <spxtr> saturn2: hah, because Elon is technically houseless and there aren't all that many homeless people to bring down the average

[15:26:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, this is some kind of big-brain approach to designing software: "can't have shitty features if we don't have features *taps head*"
[15:27:02] <PapuaHardyNet> that's a serious approach to designing software though
[15:27:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is not serious
[15:27:15] <PapuaHardyNet> hear me out
[15:27:57] <PapuaHardyNet> I wrote my own CLI/TUI SRS app that uses plaintext to store flashcards. super super simple, wrote it in Golang, rock solid code
[15:28:35] <PapuaHardyNet> It works, I've used it for an year now, and I've had desires to add features, but keep realizing the benefits of the feature and the complexity aren't worth it
[15:28:41] <synthmeat> it's perfectly fine approach - for personal-use software
[15:29:00] <synthmeat> "People are strange"
[15:29:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, if you *know you don't need a feature*, then sure, don't add that feature to *software designed for yourself only*
[15:29:24] <PapuaHardyNet> of course, I don't ask my employers to stop using electron
[15:29:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... imo you should, lol
[15:29:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Electron is bad
[15:29:42] <PapuaHardyNet> hahahah
[15:29:49] <synthmeat> i have a feeling like node is kinda dying
[15:29:57] <synthmeat> or at least transitioning in type of popularity
[15:29:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Good fucking riddance if so
[15:30:18] <PapuaHardyNet> but seriously, I understand their reasoning, and it makes sense from the product perspective
[15:30:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Still, there's a middle ground between "literally write bytes to an output stream by hand" and "bloated JavaScript monstrosity to display a line of text"
[15:30:52] <synthmeat> let's just say that what has been done with node, has been done, imho
[15:31:05] <PapuaHardyNet> ed vs vscode kek
[15:31:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> There are, actually, IRC clients that tread that middle ground! It's not a narrow middle! It's very wide!
[15:31:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> We had plenty of software that occupied that middle ground, for literal decades!
[15:31:40] <PapuaHardyNet> obormot: I'm *very* comfortable with ii! I love their logging first approach! I don't need more features either :)
[15:31:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is a "logging first approach"
[15:31:54] <PapuaHardyNet> I wrote my own script to aggregate all mentions, for example
[15:32:18] <PapuaHardyNet> as in all chats are piped into a file, and to view the stream of chat you need to do a `tail -f out`
[15:32:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Lame
[15:32:33] <synthmeat> logging first is what works for dbs!
[15:32:33] <PapuaHardyNet> you break my heart man
[15:32:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Snak logs all chats transparently AND YET, SOMEHOW, still also manages to have tab completion
[15:33:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And also scriptability)
[15:33:25] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm not changing my irc client. never!
[15:33:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's like...
[15:33:30] <dv^_^> ii seems pretty cool
[15:34:01] <PapuaHardyNet> I actually also tried two other suckless irc clients, catgirl and kirc
[15:34:12] <PapuaHardyNet> the problem with catgirl is that it forces only TLS connections
[15:34:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Some people say "I can write a good IRC client by writing a maximally compatible app that runs in Electron on all platforms!"
[15:34:19] <PapuaHardyNet> and with kirc is that it doesn't easily work with tor
[15:34:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Other people say "I can write a good IRC client by writing a text-only app that takes 0.01 bits of disk space and exactly one nanobyte of memory!"
[15:34:48] <PapuaHardyNet> with ii you can be like `torsocks ii <options>` and it just works, kirc loses its shit when you try it
[15:35:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> And still other people say "I can write a good IRC client by writing a good IRC client."
[15:35:18] <PapuaHardyNet> good zen koan
[15:35:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> In my experience the third philosophy is what results in the best software in any category
[15:35:54] <synthmeat> third philosophy?
[15:36:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, the third of the three I just listed
[15:36:22] <Khoth> imagine wasting all that disk space on ii when you can just use telnet
[15:36:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> To make good software, you have to make good software
[15:36:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> "as few features as possible" is not the secret shortcut to good software

[15:37:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> "compatible with everything" is also not the secret shortcut to good software

[18:21:25] <two2thehead> "In this paper we provide a mathematical derivation that links traditional time-value-of-money concepts to Metcalfe value, and use Bitcoin, Facebook as numerical examples of the proof. There is compelling evidence that suggests that the growth and price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are likely to proceed according to a relatively straightforward mathematical model similar to the growth curves of Facebook and other networks. Using observed 
[18:21:25] <two2thehead> data for Bitcoin, we derive the relationships between price, number of users, and time, and show that the resulting market prices likely follow a Gompertz sigmoid growth function. This function, historically used to describe the growth of biological organisms like bacteria, tumors, and viruses, likely has some application to network economics. We conclude that the long-term growth rate in users has considerable effect on the long-term price of

[18:26:55] <PapuaHardyNet> time to fomo in again
[18:27:59] <two2thehead> dunno, I'm not an expert
[18:28:39] <kuudes> it is interesting that western countries should give more doses to africa and abstain of third doses for nationals, so that... they can give third doses to their nationals? O_o
[18:29:55] <two2thehead> kuudes, selection bias (most people in the west who want vaccines probably already have got them), and equalizing of the median vaccinated levels per person geographically imo
[18:30:14] <two2thehead> iirc SSA has the lowest rates of vaccination per capita
[18:30:37] <kuudes> we haven't got third doses nor doses for children, and both of those have been opposed on grounds that we should gift more vaccines to africa so that they would have any doses
[18:30:56] <kuudes> so nigeria imo should use those third doses instead to some people's first or second doses in ssa
[18:31:10] <kuudes> and rather, they should only give out first doses in ssa until "everyone" have got them
[18:31:14] <two2thehead> I don't know about your specifics. I thought this was the first two being distributed
[18:31:25] <kuudes> they are the same stuff.
[18:31:32] <kuudes> same doses, same bottles
[18:31:39] <kuudes> there are no specific "booster" bottles
[18:31:44] <two2thehead> ah, I see your point
[18:31:46] <two2thehead> yes.
[18:32:00] <two2thehead> Probably my second argument then
[18:32:17] <kuudes> they have no moral right to use our boosters as their boosters
[18:32:39] <kuudes> or rather, we have no moral duty to abstain from third doses just so that they could get third doses
[18:32:41] <two2thehead> for the record I'm not saying they do
[18:33:06] <kuudes> nor we should abstain of vaccinating kids just so that they can vaccinate their kids
[18:33:26] <kuudes> we have moral right to treat ourselves first, we have no moral duty to treat others before ourselves.

We focus on cohorts that were born during the famine and examine their mental health as adults, when they are roughly 55 years of age. We find that early-life exposure to this famine leads to a large statistically significant negative impact on women’s mental health, while there is limited effect on men. This gender differential effect
[19:30:45] <two2thehead>  is observed because male fetuses experience a stronger natural selection as compared to female fetuses, which implies that in the longer run, surviving females may exhibit larger detrimental effects of early-life famine exposure.

[20:49:57] * gwern checks. uh oh. 'select all tabs' only refers to the *current window*, so he didn't save all his windows+tabs like he thought he did
[20:51:22] <vrs> places.sqlite isn't that hard to get data out of
[20:52:32] <gwern> no, but figuring out the set of tabs might be. I noticed in the History pane that background tabs, ie most of them, don't get recorded. so I can't just dump visited-URLs, look for the batch of 1k tabs on startup, and take that as the full set of tabs
[20:52:38] <PapuaHardyNet> tabbed + surf allows you to have a ton of tabs, each of which is almost a separate instance of the surf browser
[20:53:04] <PapuaHardyNet> should be a lot more solid as an implementation. Also bonus: you can search for tab titles to go to the specific tab you want
[20:53:22] <PapuaHardyNet> the only reason I don't use it is because the web is unusable without ublock origin
[20:55:45] <gwern> I guess I'll restore my .mozilla folder from a backup, open it up to restore the active tabs, curate by hand, restore the current one, and curate the difference by hand as well... the burden of my sins
[20:56:22] <PapuaHardyNet> hey, at least you back up the .mozilla folder
[20:57:32] <feep> omg! auralnauts star wars ep7 teaser is out!
[20:58:48] <kuudes> firefox can bookmark all your open tabs btw
[20:59:10] <feep> how is it that it can bookmark, but it can`t reliably restore
[20:59:42] <kuudes> right click on tab, select all tabs. then right click on tab, select bookmark tabs. then you get to a query where you write a tab folder name and it puts all of those as bookmarks there
[20:59:50] <kuudes> feep, because close()
[20:59:56] <feep> that makes no sense
[20:59:58] <kuudes> or flush()
[21:00:02] <gwern> kuudes: I just explained how that failed
[21:00:31] <kuudes> hmm
[21:01:03] <gwern> you, as well as all the people I copied that advice from, implicitly assume there is only *one* window
[21:01:12] <kuudes> ah, indeed, you only bookmarked one of the session windows
[21:01:15] <kuudes> yeah, sorry
[21:01:26] <gwern> but open up multiple windows, do the right click, and switch to the other window - none of them will be selected
[21:01:36] <kuudes> indeed
[21:06:00] <Obormot\Gaia> On Chrome there is Session Buddy, which is excellent, but not available or Firefox
[21:06:12] <Obormot\Gaia> If it were, it would be the definitive and ideal solution
[21:06:41] <gwern> I assume that this is because either I am hitting bugs in having way too many tabs open, or possible subtle corruption in my profile. in either case, starting over will fix it
