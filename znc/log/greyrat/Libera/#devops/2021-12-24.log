[00:44:55] <menace> well, i tried that with tf providers, but it's not really accessible imho
[00:58:12] <rawtaz> lantech19446: are you on your way to an interview yet?
[00:59:01] *** Joins: Alina-malina (~Alina-mal@user/alina-malina)
[01:00:07] <lantech19446> rawtaz: I never heard back from the recruiter once I said I was available the next morning

[01:26:02] <slaughter> menace what do you mean not accessible? It's a searchable UI
[01:34:54] <rawtaz> lantech19446: bah. oh well, they might just have been busy. also jobs etc get cancelled sometimes.
[01:35:02] <rawtaz> dont worry about it, just keep doing your thing :)
[01:38:12] <lantech19446> yea just kinda sucks because that job would have gotten me a step closer but I don't actually need to move immediately I know what my path is and I have a way to get there with or without it
[01:38:35] <rawtaz> this was still experience, you got to see a bit of how recruiters work
[01:40:08] <lantech19446> yea i've stayed away from them for as long as i can lol
[01:40:18] <rawtaz> lol
[01:40:26] <rawtaz> wait until you get to see agreements and shit
[01:40:37] <rawtaz> or well, if youre going for an employment then you will probably not have much issues with it
[01:40:44] <rawtaz> its when you do consulting that you see all the shit behind the scenes
[01:40:48] <rawtaz> mentally insane stuff
[01:40:56] <rawtaz> so employed == good in many ways
[01:41:54] <lantech19446> if nothing else being employed makes it easier to hold out for the job you really want
[01:43:45] <rawtaz> in what way?
[01:47:46] <lantech19446> if you're already employed there isn't the desperation to take anything that pays
[01:51:34] <rawtaz> oh

[10:09:31] <menace> lantech19446, so, tell me with 3 minute glance, which tf provider is for a cloud which is located within country X, let's say iceland
[10:31:02] <slaughter> menace I think before you jump into finding tf providers by country you need a list of cloud providers. Presumably if you're at the level of looking specifically for icelandic providers you have a list already
[10:32:21] <slaughter> If you had a list of cloud providers by country in the first place, cross checking against the TF provider registry (or anywhere else) would be quick and easy
