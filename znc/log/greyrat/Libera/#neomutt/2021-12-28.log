[10:42:58] <dngray[m]> hmm so i am thinking
[10:43:05] <dngray[m]> mbsync + msmtp + neomutt + notmuch, might be nice to have them in a docker container
[10:43:16] <dngray[m]> does anyone else do this?
[10:43:48] <dngray[m]> i'd been installing these through AUR on archlinux, but now that i'm looking at moivng to silverblue
[10:44:05] <dngray[m]> i think i would rather have them all in a container i easily pull up with podman-compose
[11:03:00] <jirib> what is the benefit?
[11:03:24] <jirib> your data would live outside of container anyway, don't do they?
[11:04:59] <jirib> how do i combine this macro with a save-hook? my problem is i use virtual mailbox (notmuch) with multiple accounts and i'd like to archive to an account specific archive folder
[11:05:01] <jirib> macro index A ":set confirmappend=no delete=yes\n<save-message>=archive\n<sync-mailbox>:set confirmappend=yes delete=ask-yes\n"
[11:05:31] <jirib> ie. how to combine the macro and 'set folder=/path/' set via save-hook...

[11:50:52] <gahr> jirib: so you would like the save-hook to run before =archive is expanded into $folder/archive?
[11:51:08] <jirib> gahr: yes
[11:53:03] <jirib> wouldn't a new hook make it easier, eg. index-hook ? index already has to know some mails "metadata"
[11:54:11] <gahr> doesn't it, already?
[11:57:06] <jirib> i meant this: we don't have index-hook, but if we would have index-hook which could eg. do '~t @example\.com set folder=/example.com' then any operation with mail could use it
[11:57:32] <jirib> i'm newbie with (neo)mutt, so apoligizes for me confusions
[11:57:34] <gahr> well the issue is that save-hook only sets the default save directory
[11:57:47] <gahr> it doesn't allow you to set custom config variables
[11:58:45] <jirib> i tried to use this: save-hook '~Y example.com\.info' 'set folder=~/.mail/example.com'
[11:58:55] <gahr> yeah, you can't
[11:59:06] <gahr> https://neomutt.org/guide/configuration.html#18-%C2%A0specify-default-fcc-and-or-save-mailbox
[11:59:14] <jirib> is it doable at all?
[11:59:15] <gahr> as you can read, save-hook takes a pattern and a mailbox
[11:59:32] <gahr> it just drives the default folder that neomutt will suggest when you save
[12:00:19] <gahr> I'm thinking if there's a way to do that

[12:04:41] <gahr> there's a hack: you could use message-hook to set folder
[12:04:50] <gahr> and add entering/exiting the pager to your macro
[12:06:45] <gahr> entering the pager would trigger message-hook
[12:09:51] <gahr> hey wait!
[12:09:59] <gahr> MESSAGE_HOOK does run before SAVE_HOOK
[12:14:12] <gahr> it works fine here
[12:14:35] <gahr> message-hook to set different folders, and macro that calls <save-message>+Foo, expands to the correct folder

[19:18:13] <lunario> hi. so after I switched from devuan to artix as a distro, neomutt does not display html mails correctly anymore. instead of using w3m ($BROWSER is set to w3m) it uses my gui browser. When I open an html mail mutt issues this command before opening the mail in the gui browser: "Invoking autoview command: /usr/bin/xdg-open '/tmp/_{_condense__val___iv_subject__}.htm_'"
[19:18:32] <lunario> also, the mail is not portrayed correctly, instead it's just shown as html source code
[19:19:59] <bookworm> then... don't do that? As in change the config
[19:24:56] <flatcap> lunario: neomutt doesn't know about $BROWSER, it uses mailcap files to decide what to do...
[19:25:06] <flatcap> the default config is:
[19:25:09] <flatcap> set mailcap_path = "~/.mailcap:/usr/share/neomutt/mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:/usr/local/etc/mailcap"
[19:25:52] <flatcap> my mailcap file contains:
[19:25:55] <flatcap> text/html; links -dump-width ${COLUMNS:-80} -dump %s; nametemplate=%s.html; print=cat; copiousoutput
[19:26:22] <bookworm> some distros overwrite the default config, so I'd go there first if the config wasn't done locally
[19:27:47] <flatcap> see all the `auto_view` command: https://neomutt.org/guide/mimesupport.html#auto-view
[19:27:56] <flatcap> and `alternative_order` https://neomutt.org/guide/mimesupport.html#alternative-order
[19:28:02] <flatcap> for fine-tuning
[19:28:26] <lunario> hmm yeah i am pretty sure it is due to artix overwriting my defaults
[19:28:29] <lunario> thanks for the hints
[19:29:01] <flatcap> np
[19:29:09] <bookworm> chances are they just redirected all mailcap things to xdg-open, which is a good thing in most applications
[19:29:16] <bookworm> not so much if you wanna use it as a filter...
