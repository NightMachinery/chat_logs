[00:00:27] <huf> just barely. it's not proper.
[00:01:20] <pussipupu> the police were warning earlier about trade in stolen birds
[00:01:35] <pussipupu> Apparently we should be on the lookout bit budgies going cheep
[00:02:02] <huf> that reminds me, how do i make friends with a cool bird in my neighborhood?
[00:02:15] <pussipupu> feed it is the normal way
[00:02:42] <huf> having a cat doesnt help here :D
[00:03:06] <pussipupu> Leave the cat inside

[00:04:17] <huf> I also saw a bird the size of a cat's mouth scare my cat away

[00:05:13] <TechTest> it's nice to have a garden for the kitties
[00:05:15] <TechTest> I don't
[00:05:17] <huf> she's really about mice mostly, and she doesnt kill them 
[00:05:35] <huf> mostly just brings them inside completely unharmed and lets them go
[00:05:38] <huf> and then looks at them
[00:05:41] <huf> as they cower
[00:05:52] <huf> sometimes lies on top of them as they cower
[00:05:55] <TechTest> and then you have mice at home
[00:06:04] <huf> and then I have to kill the mice, yes
[00:06:20] <huf> I'm pretty good at it now
[00:06:25] <huf> fucking cat taught me :D
[00:07:31] <TechTest> we only have fake mice here
[00:07:32] <huf> step one: get a thick towel, fold it in half; step two: grab mouse with the folded towel as if it were a turd.
[00:08:01] <TechTest> dude don't kill them, just get them outside
[00:08:18] <huf> so the cat can bring it in again?
[00:08:35] <huf> and anyway, mice certainly can use some thinning in a city
[00:08:38] <TechTest> the cat will find new mice anyways :P
[00:08:45] <huf> hah
[00:08:52] <huf> I've actually tried this
[00:09:02] <huf> cat caught the same mouse again
[00:09:14] <TechTest> how do you know it is the same?
[00:09:26] <huf> I watched it through the window
[00:09:31] <TimMc> hahaha
[00:09:57] <TimMc> I once released a mouse and watched a sparrow try to catch it.
[00:10:17] <huf> cat I used to have was raised by the streets and shit
[00:10:21] <huf> he ate mice
[00:10:26] <TimMc> Paint unique sequences on the mouse's tail with nail polish so you can be sure.
[00:10:35] <huf> they caught one at one time and let it go in here
[00:11:02] <huf> I was chasing it out, it tried to run out the front door but I closed it just as it was running through by the doorjamb
[00:11:23] <huf> other cat gobbled the back half of the mouse up before I could even look

[15:19:16] <TechTest> are you selling your car?
[15:19:24] <blkshp> The owner of the original plant Henry Ford said, for the first model built 2They can have it in any color as long as it's Black"
[15:19:38] <huf> I dont think he actually said it, but it's widely believed :)
[15:19:45] <huf> a fake quote with a hat
[15:20:03] <TechTest> so you are not selling a car
[15:20:30] <blkshp> Henry Ford (1863-1947) documented that he made the “any color so long as it is black” comment during a meeting in 1909 (Henry Ford in collaboration with Samuel Crowther in My Life and Work.

[18:32:13] <GuiToris> I read giphy as filty
[18:32:33] <CuriosTiger> I read that as "I am the lawn".
[18:32:41] <CuriosTiger> which would explain why he's so upset about a pin.
[18:33:05] <GuiToris> huhh, what luck, at first I thought it was going to be Star Trek
[18:33:27] <CuriosTiger> It would be awesome if it were Star Trek
[18:33:49] <GuiToris> it's finally time to start the track!
[18:34:02] <blkshp> I believe if it were Star Trek. I'd post a Janeway Gif saying "dismissed".

[18:35:19] <CuriosTiger> blkshp : And I would respond with https://tinyurl.com/4s5822hu
[18:35:54] <blkshp> pfft far too mainstream!
[18:35:54] <GuiToris> blkshp, are you the kind of people who pronounce GIF as JIF?
[18:36:31] <CuriosTiger> blkshp : Better? https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/kXsAAOSwjxdgJKMK/s-l500.jpg
[18:36:32] <blkshp> Negative.
[18:36:56] <blkshp> Getting better.
[18:36:59] <CuriosTiger> GIF has a hard G. The creator of the format disagrees, but he's clearly clueless. :)
[18:38:28] <blkshp> In the UK we had a cleaning product called "Jif" pronounced that way, They changed it to Cif after it was decided the Germans coundn't pronounce it.
[18:38:34] <GuiToris> git is also pronounced with the G (good) sound and not 'jit', I don't know why gif is so special
[18:38:54] <GuiToris> blkshp, I know Cif!
[18:39:14] <blkshp> Yes, it used to be Jif. with a Juh.
[18:39:39] <GuiToris> hmm, I thought that product was local :D
[18:39:46] <GuiToris> I've never looked that up
[18:40:20] <blkshp> Cif is a French brand of household cleaning products owned by the Anglo-Dutch company Unilever, known as Jif in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Middle East and the Nordic countries. Cif was launched in France in 1965 and was marketed in competition against scouring powders (such … 
[18:40:36] <GuiToris> are we talking about the same product? http://www.supersteam.com.sg/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CIF.jpg
[18:40:57] <blkshp> Yes

[18:41:21] <CuriosTiger> GuiToris: Probably because "git" is already a word in English, so there was no ambiguity.
[18:41:38] <blkshp> Jif is also a brand of spray lemon juice.
[18:43:18] <CuriosTiger> Also, g + vowel + stop consonant generally gets a hard G pronunciation. git, get, geek, goop, gob, etc.
[18:43:32] *** Joins: zer0bitz (~zer0bitz@dsl-hkibng31-54fafc-123.dhcp.inet.fi)
[18:43:43] <CuriosTiger> In fact, when English wants a soft G in that scenario, it changes the spelling: Jet, jab.
[18:44:01] <blkshp> gel, germ, general, generic, genius
[18:44:16] <CuriosTiger> l, r, n are not stop consonants blkshp.
[18:44:25] <blkshp> I don't know what a stop consonant is.
[18:44:32] <blkshp> You made that up
[18:44:45] <pussipupu> One where the flow of air is stopped
[18:44:46] <CuriosTiger> ones that have a sudden release of air. bdg, ptk.
[18:45:48] <blkshp> So not "f" then
[18:46:07] <CuriosTiger> I guess I should use the proper term "plosive", https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plosive -- but amusingly, Simple English Wikipedia has an entry https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_consonant
[18:46:32] <CuriosTiger> correct, f is a fricative.
[18:46:42] <blkshp> So gif. with a juh.
[18:46:49] * blkshp terminates enquiry
[18:46:51] <blkshp> xD
[18:46:54] <CuriosTiger> Now you're just being joofy.
[18:46:56] <GuiToris> [16:14] <blkshp> You made that up << I love your attitude

[18:48:53] <marianne> Oh Jet
[18:48:59] <marianne> The song by the Wings
[18:49:10] <CuriosTiger> No, the airplane that flies through the sky.
[18:49:22] <marianne> Terrible Hangover, I am going to listen to it now.
[18:49:39] <CuriosTiger> Uh oh, marianne went partying.
[18:50:00] <marianne> I meant that what you said reminded me of the song og det var flott
[18:50:08] <CuriosTiger> I like the name "Marianne" because it reminds me of a hostess of a children's TV show I grew up with.
[18:50:11] <marianne> Ja det var fantastisk ogsa
[18:50:17] <marianne> Cool
[18:50:30] <marianne> I have a cat btw
[18:50:34] <CuriosTiger> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAx8DlS5oUE
[18:50:42] <marianne> The tigers I see at the zoo
[18:50:44] <marianne> They scare me
[18:50:53] <marianne> More than the ICU nights lol
[18:51:19] <CuriosTiger> it's a bird who crashlands into a house in Bergen and asks the owner if he can live there. She lets him, and the rest of the show is about his crazy antics and how the owner of the house -- Marianne -- deals with them.
[18:51:49] <marianne> I have found a Catholic church to visit in Bergen with my mother
[18:51:57] <marianne> If I get to survive this shitty year
[18:52:09] <CuriosTiger> There are a few catholic churches around Norway, but most of them are Lutheran.
[18:52:30] <marianne> Ohhhh nooo
[18:52:36] <marianne> We need a real one
[18:52:48] <marianne> 💔
[18:52:55] <CuriosTiger> then you should find a synagogue. Judaism is older than Christianity. :P
[18:53:13] <marianne> No nvm
[18:53:22] <marianne> We can get coffee together
[18:53:39] <marianne> But thank you for letting me now.
[18:53:40] <CuriosTiger> (Protip: Telling other people that their churches or religions aren't "real" is not going to make you any friends."
[18:53:56] <marianne> Sorry I did not mean that
[18:54:04] <marianne> My apologies
[18:54:16] <CuriosTiger> apology accepted
[18:54:30] <marianne> It is white tea party morning I shall return when I make more sense.

[18:58:05] <marianne> There is no northern lights here
[18:58:30] <CuriosTiger> "You can't get cherry soda coz they've got to fill that quota"
[18:58:32] <marianne> I have decided to see the northern lights in Norwat
[18:58:43] <marianne> Norway*
[18:58:53] <marianne> I do not like Sweden anymore
[18:59:06] <CuriosTiger> I've seen the northern lights in Norway. They are beautiful. But they are equally beautiful in Sweden.
[18:59:11] <marianne> And I do not know anything about Denmark.
[18:59:17] <CuriosTiger> I like all three.
[18:59:22] <marianne> Good
[18:59:39] <CuriosTiger> I would consider living in Sweden or Denmark for a while.
[18:59:45] <marianne> I do not but I respect them though.
[18:59:52] <twb> I hear .se has better beaches
[19:00:07] <CuriosTiger> .dk has the best beaches in Scandinavia, with .se at #2.
[19:00:18] <marianne> I love Roxette so how do I listen to them and hate the country I would not forgive myself
[19:00:32] <CuriosTiger> Norway has a few decent beaches, but due to the mountainous coast, a lot more of Norway's coastline is extremely rocky.
[19:00:40] <marianne> What am I going to tell my students?
[19:01:05] <CuriosTiger> The problem with beaches in all of Scandinavia is the water. That shit is cold, yo. Even all the way south in Jutland in Denmark.
[19:01:17] <marianne> I plan to show them Susanne Sundfor too
[19:01:45] <CuriosTiger> If you want nice beaches in Europe, check out Málaga in Spain.
[19:01:47] <marianne> Great Norwegian singing about rejection without being desperare
[19:02:29] <CuriosTiger> not familiar with her.

[20:07:12] <jonix> Hello. When i have too many text for one Power Point Slide, I split the text and paste first part in First Slide and Write "(CONTINUES)"
[20:07:25] <jonix> what should I write at the beginning of the second slide??
[20:08:44] <pussipupu> *too much text
[20:08:48] <jonix> "(CONTINUED FROM FIRST SLIDE)"       ?
[20:09:05] <pussipupu> Personally I'd just use "..." at the end of the first slide and beginning of the next
[20:09:21] <jonix> thanks pussipupu 
[20:09:25] <blkshp> I'm sure that there's a possibility of splitting at the start of a new paragraph and then you don't really need anything.
[20:09:41] <jonix> blkshp: thanks.
[20:09:54] <jonix> actually i got a list  ( 1, 2,3 4, .....) 
[20:10:17] <jonix> that is why i need to let the audience know that the list has not ended in the first slide

[22:50:08] <darsie> Thanks
[22:54:21] <darsie> I was wondering if the material that causes soiling could possibly be soiled ... and thought what it could be soiled with.
[22:56:23] <hoglahoo> isnt that like asking if you can make water wet
[22:58:12] <darsie> .w water
[22:58:13] <tinsoldier> water — Noun: 1. (uncountable) A substance (of molecular formula H₂O) found at room temperature and pressure as a clear liquid; it is present naturally as rain, and found in rivers, lakes and seas; its solid form is ice and its gaseous form is steam., 2. (alchemy, philosophy) The aforementioned liquid, considered one of the Classical eleme <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/water> nts or...
[22:59:57] <darsie> It doesn't exactly say that water is liquid only.
[23:00:34] <darsie> And I'm not sure whether the humidity in air is steam.

[23:01:43] <tinsoldier> steam — Noun: 1. The vapor formed when water changes from liquid phase to gas phase., 2. Pressurized water vapour used for heating, cooking, or to provide mechanical energy., 3. The act of cooking by steaming, 4. (figuratively) Internal energy for motive power., — Verb: 1. (cooking, transitive) To cook with steam., 2. (transitive) To expose to the ac <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/steam>...
[23:02:08] <hoglahoo> my point is that it’s more of a riddle used to get kids to argue with each other
[23:02:43] <darsie> Gaseous or frozen water could be made wet by condensing or melting it.
[23:05:45] <darsie> One could say water is not wet towards hydrophobic things like water bugs. It could be made wet by adding detergent.
[23:06:27] <darsie> Sorry for missing your point.
[23:06:37] <hoglahoo> no problem, you have your own valid ones
[23:07:06] <hoglahoo> neither of ours appear to be catching on with anyone else though
