People who are inept (mostly bad managers) worry about their underlings not "doing enough"--most likely because they feel deficient in their own managing abilities and feel people will slack off if they're not cracking a whip.

[00:41:00] <raccoon_dog> And the circumstances surrounding that specific release ... holy shit.
[00:41:18] <RedCrab> Oh? I'm not familiar
[00:41:37] <raccoon_dog> The album was apparently leaked by a Target employee before the actual release date.
[00:42:00] <raccoon_dog> The dude met up with someone at a Las Vegas hotel and they ripped the CD and uploaded it.

[00:42:59] <RedCrab> Wowwww
[00:43:18] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, the whole situation is true, but reads like a Hollywood movie.
[00:43:23] <TimMc> raccoon_dog: Expiration dates are generally bunk. Or often aren't actually "expiration dates", just "take this off the shelves by this date" or "the flavor may decline after this date".
[00:43:40] <raccoon_dog> TimMc: Yeah, I do tend to interpret them as "best before," rather than "must consume before."
[00:43:51] <raccoon_dog> TimMc: But the context is key: this was a whole month.
[00:43:54] <raccoon_dog> Not a couple of days.
[00:44:53] <TimMc> Didn't see, but would need more info.
[00:45:14] <TimMc> I mean, milk would probably go bad by then.
[00:45:22] <TimMc> but I would generally trust my nose

[00:45:36] <raccoon_dog> [22:03:48] <RedCrab> "it's only a month after the expiration date" kind of stuff
[00:45:39] <raccoon_dog> ^ Context.
[00:45:50] <RedCrab> TimMc: this was for clam sauce
[00:45:52] <TimMc> Yeah, but is it like... cereal?
[00:46:19] <TimMc> I don't know what that is exactly, but is it canned and sterilized?
[00:46:25] <TimMc> unopened?
[00:46:49] <TimMc> That shit lasts forever, or at least until the metal corrodes and lets bacteria in.
[00:48:37] <RedCrab> it comes in a bottle, like Ketchup or Soy Sauc
[00:50:18] <RedCrab> lall-: you mentioned your gf is Chinese/Thai. What kind of food does she usually make?
[00:50:45] <lall-> she doesn't amke food. she makes reservations.
[00:50:51] <RedCrab> ha!
[00:50:53] <raccoon_dog> lol
[00:52:03] <TimMc> haha
[00:52:22] <TimMc> The way I would model it is this: Sterile until opened, so the clock only starts ticking when you first open it. Each time you open it, there is some chance of contamination, which may or may not take hold; bacterial growth rate depends on degree-days (how cold is the fridge?) and water activity (is it salty?)
[00:53:12] <TimMc> I've never seen or heard of ketchup going bad, but there's a lot of sugar/salt/acid in it. No idea how similar clam sauce is.
[00:54:48] <RedCrab> that's my hope. She makes a lot of Asian food, which is salted/acidic as shit. So thankfully I think any bacteria would die the moment it landed in there
[00:59:01] <TimMc> I make a lot of lacto-fermented vegetables (such as sauerkraut), which means just mixing salt with chopped vegetables, stuffing them in a jar, and waiting a couple weeks.
[00:59:40] <TimMc> I often just let them sit out at room temperature after they're done fermenting. They're so salty and acidic that even in those conditions, mold struggles to get a foothold.
[01:00:09] <lall-> me too. i love that stuff. i use brocolly, cauliflower, onions, salt and vinegar... stuff that in a jar, wait a week, and then put itin the fridge.
[01:00:43] <TimMc> That sounds brined rather than fermented, depending on how much vinegar you use.
[01:00:49] <TimMc> but also delicious
[01:01:34] <TimMc> Right now I'm making pickled turnips -- turnips + red cabbage = pink turnips. :-)
[01:01:38] <lall-> it's super sour and delicious, as for cabbage... "sauerkraut", i do that too... bunch of salt and cabbage in a plastic barrel and wait for it to ferment. afterwards, i bottle the "water" and drink it. :)
[01:04:13] <TimMc> Hmm, the brine isn't to my taste. Haven't figure out what to do with it myself.
[01:04:25] <TimMc> Usually there's not much left, though.
[01:04:51] <lall-> salty sour goodness.
[01:05:18] <lall-> my gf hates it too.

[01:08:45] <lall-> i keep the barrel in my living room. after a week it starts to stink, and she's pissed off at it, trying to get me to take it outside. problem is, where i live.. outside is 45c. usually you keep these things in the basement during winter because you need slow fermentation, if you store it at 45c, it's going to go bad, so i keep it in the living room because i got aircon running.
[01:10:31] <TimMc> Yeah, the cabbage goes through this unfortunate phase where it smells like a fart.
[01:10:49] <lall-> it does stink.
[01:11:13] <TimMc> Better to have the sauerkraut do your farting for you, though.
[01:13:16] <lall-> you know the fact, in german prisons during ww2, people were dying left right and center. they introduced sauerkraut to the prisoners, and the death rate fell by 80%

[01:26:25] <lall-> fermented veggies seem to be loaded with vitamin C.
[01:29:47] <TimMc> There have been mixed results on that, probably due to varying storage practices that allow varying amounts of oxidation.
[01:30:43] <TimMc> It might be more accurate to say that fresh vegetables are loaded with vitamin C, and that fermentation doesn't seem to destroy it, unlike cooking or dehydration.

[07:06:48] <xinming> Hi, in programming, there is a state, where the data will not be finalized until 3 days later, which means the data will not be updated anymore, So, I have a column named "finalized" to mean this. but I just now get curious, how would you call a state not "finalized" in this case? thans

[08:09:43] <xinming> RedCrab: It's just some stock candles data fetched from website, the last day candle keeps changing, so I keep a flag in the table to mean it's not finalized.
[08:10:16] <xinming> RedCrab: when it's not finalized, we'll always update, until 2 days passed.
[08:11:16] <xinming> So have a column finalized in the table, I'm not native English speaker, So I got curious, what is the right way to say not-finalized thing in this case. :-)
[08:11:36] <xinming> in programming, it's easy,  if (!$object.is_finalized) { }
[08:12:06] <RedCrab> Hmm, I'm not sure what "candle" means in this case, unless you mean an actual candle that can be burned/used for scents? But it sounds like you just want to know if something is finalized. In that case, a boolean would probably be best, and set to false until it's finalized
[08:12:54] <RedCrab> the wording you have above makes sense to me :)
[08:13:57] <RedCrab> I would probably use a method rather than call the object field directly. So $object.is_finalized() 
[08:16:41] <RedCrab> it looks like you're using PHP (or Perl)? If it's PHP, I've found you have to be a little more explicit to avoid errors, or how PHP evaluates booleans. More info: https://stackoverflow.com/a/2382510/833861
[08:16:54] <xinming> RedCrab: candle means candle chart in stock charting
[08:17:41] <xinming> RedCrab: well, ignore me, It's just illustration.
[08:17:45] <RedCrab> Oh, I missed the word "stock" for some reason. I understand. So you probably have one record in the database for each day?
[08:18:17] <xinming> yea, so the last day is "limbo"
[08:18:18] <RedCrab> I would word it as "has_market_closed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE" or something like that
[08:18:47] <raccoon_dog> This conversation confused me.
[08:18:55] <xinming> Ok, I already choose the word "finalized"
[08:19:00] <ccp> Yeah I would also use the existing terminology of the candlestick being open/closed
[08:19:00] <xinming> raccoon_dog: what confuses you?
[08:19:02] <raccoon_dog> I thought I was looking at some programming channel. Nope, turned out I looked in the right channel.
[08:19:03] <raccoon_dog> :-D
[08:19:07] <RedCrab> finalized technically can work
[08:19:35] <RedCrab> but for context, you usually want to be descriptive with variable names
[08:20:04] <RedCrab> but you're good :)
[08:20:12] <ccp> It sounds like this is all back-end so it's not a big deal, I guess. Everyone using the chart already understands whether a candlestick is closed or when it will close, etc.
[08:21:21] <RedCrab> Yeah, exactly. Backend code can be named whatever you want, as long as the UI works for the customers, and you don't need to worry about outside devs needing documentation
[08:21:29] <ccp> But is there any possible future interaction to consider with regard to using something like 'finalized' that applies only to this thing vs. a state like open/closed that could be used in other ways later?
[08:23:00] <ccp> (if open, show timer to close, and keep updating this and that, and...)
