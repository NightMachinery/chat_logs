[02:03:10] <guideX> Nasp, I'm trying to figure out how long a Page (loaded through json) should last until it's expired
[02:03:15] <guideX> and data needs to be reloaded via database
[02:03:20] <guideX> attribute seemed like a good way
[02:03:38] <Nasp> what
[02:03:43] <guideX> basically trying to expire a cache, then reload/resave it
[02:03:59] <Nasp> Ahh so a cache you set
[02:04:02] <Nasp> Thought you meant from json
[02:04:07] <Nasp> What is this data used for?
[02:04:15] <guideX> well the data (from the database) is saved into a json file
[02:04:28] <guideX> it's used for a website, to display pages to the logged in user
[02:04:42] <guideX> and used to speed up pages and have no database hit
[02:05:20] <guideX> but it's not always apperant how long the data is supposed to last, (I don't store the expirey hours in a good spot right now)
[02:05:39] <Nasp> MVC?
[02:05:42] <guideX> of course, not every page should expire quick, some of them can last a long time, some can last hours
[02:05:44] <guideX> yeah mvc
[02:05:55] <Nasp> Can't you just use the built in stuff for that?
[02:06:02] <guideX> of course, a customers tracking information for instance should load more often than the news section (for instance)\
[02:06:21] <guideX> possibly
[02:06:38] <guideX> i want to load every page when the user visits any page, and then show them dynamically
[02:06:39] <Nasp> [ResponseCache(Duration = 60)]
[02:06:43] <guideX> I'm not sure caching does that kind of thing
[02:06:55] <guideX> not to mention, spome pages have parameters, so have to save those parameters with it
[02:07:11] <Nasp> Do you use json as db?
[02:07:26] * gufi_ wouldnt doubt it
[02:07:26] <guideX> Nasp, yeah I save much of the sites data to json files to speed up the site

[02:07:57] <Nasp> Sounds strange to use json files
[02:08:25] <gufi_> sounds strange to use anything that isnt in memory unless you reaaaaly wanna build out replication to a file
[02:08:27] <guideX> it works pretty well *shryug
[02:08:35] <gufi_> smdh
[02:09:09] <guideX> idk, our database structure, and hardware is shit.. I'm not sure what else I cna do
[02:09:17] <gufi_> throwing possible load balanced servers and state to the wind!
[02:09:43] <guideX> doing it this way; I ensure the site is both lightening fast, and not overloading the database server as well
[02:09:51] <guideX> albeit, super weird
[02:09:54] <gufi_> you could do that without the file at all

[02:11:54] <gufi_> not to mention that file is probably massive and held on a web server

[02:13:01] <gufi_> guideX, every proposed soulution you've mentioned in this channel would get most people fired.
[02:15:17] <guideX> gufi_, I think there's probably many problems with it, but I am using guids to obfuscate the files, and there's no performance problem (yet)
[02:15:33] <guideX> I've tried tests like, lots of access to the files, it performs pretty good
[02:16:01] <guideX> but the slow database is kinda the "you're gonna get fired" part
[02:16:08] <gufi_> thats because its all in memory once you read it
[02:16:19] <gufi_> if you're reading it over and over you're doin it wrong
[02:16:45] <guideX> I think the biggest problem is, I am loading the json into a hiddenfield onto the page

[02:20:39] <guideX> no I'm all alone
[02:20:48] <guideX> there's no other devs here, we're short staffed :(
[02:20:55] <guideX> I have to rely on everything myself here

[02:21:28] <gufi_> i just dont understand
[02:22:12] <gufi_> like i get upset at myself when i have poorly named variables and here you are pushing a db cache to the front end with zero reguard to datasecurity
[02:22:32] <guideX> gufi_, that's not entirely true, I am paying a great deal of attention to security and the situation
[02:22:42] <guideX> as my files are all in the file system, I put guids to obfuscate them
[02:22:56] <guideX> and then no one can browse the directory (at least)
[02:23:03] <guideX> I mean it's not super great though you're right
[02:23:09] <JakeSays> gufi_: well, how else would data get to the browser if not for json?
[02:23:21] <gufi_> JakeSays, =D
[02:23:58] <gufi_> guideX, hope like hell no one has access to those files and you're not storing any pii in them
[02:24:11] <guideX> I'm very careful what I store in there yeah
[02:24:29] <guideX> because it's so vulnerable like you say, I just try to store the bare minimum to display the site
[02:24:54] <gufi_> the fact that db info is stored anywhere other than the db is already amazing to me
[02:25:31] <khanred> o_O
[02:25:32] <guideX> this is just the continuous complaint I get, is the site is so slow, it's because our database is old/shitty and the structure is extra shitty, all kinds of processing takes place to get the data
[02:25:36] <guideX> it's so horrible imo
[02:25:48] <gufi_> so... Fix the problem, dont cover it up
[02:25:55] <guideX> they're cheap
[02:26:03] <guideX> they won't fix it
[02:26:39] <guideX> the data itself is like, multiple other guys have built up this extra shitty structure
[02:26:50] <gufi_> how much profiling did you do before you just said " ok i'll fix it" and magiked up a json cache with guid identifiers that relate to ... some piece of identifyable data in the db?
[02:26:50] <guideX> I can't just go in and change it, it'll break their other stufff
[02:27:12] <guideX> gufi_, the original structure is wrecked, I even have a database based cache before this cache (2 caches)
[02:27:38] <guideX> it's so slow, I can't even get the data out of the original location into the json cache, I need an intermediary cache
[02:27:48] <guideX> it's totally ridiculous
[02:28:15] <gufi_> dude we have a db that uses magic sql queries based on other data in the same db and still manage to get requests like that done in less than 2 seconds
[02:28:39] <gufi_> full async style requests where its request to make data query -> another request to get the data after the process is done

[02:33:35] <guideX> not by a long shot
[02:33:57] <gufi_> use in memory caching
[02:34:23] <gufi_> split the queries to where they're less demanding, profile the db to see what scans you're doing instead of seeks...
[02:35:12] <guideX> bhmm I'll check out in memory caching, I forgot why I don't want to use it
[02:35:30] <merced> if you've got more than one server, in-memory caching probably isn't the best for you

[02:39:43] <merced> ew
[02:39:44] <guideX> I'm still really happy writting stored procs, with a micro orm and everything, but, sql 2000 (barf)
[02:39:45] <merced> whats wrong with you
[02:39:48] <JakeSays> i haven't written a line of orm either
[02:39:49] <gufi_> same. my manager has agreed that none of us are writing any sql
[02:39:53] <khanred> merced, We're still trying to figure that out

[02:39:59] <gufi_> orm or nothing

[02:40:26] <JakeSays> no orm, or frontend, or db, or.. none of that shit.
[02:40:29] <guideX> I don't like the way the query is written for me, potentially a bad one
[02:40:37] <gufi_> jake do you even write code any more?
[02:40:37] <khanred> JakeSays, Ah so you're a manager
[02:40:38] <merced> ORMs are great for simple use cases
[02:40:52] <JakeSays> guideX: well, in your situation you need all the perf you can get, so i probably wouldn't use an orm either
[02:40:52] <guideX> especially; our structure is shit and I can't change it really
[02:40:59] <JakeSays> khanred: i am not
[02:41:04] <merced> but when you start talking enterprise-scale with thousands of requests per minute, ORMs start to lag
[02:41:15] <guideX> this is why I cache everything via back end tasks (no one will notice how slow it is)
[02:41:20] <merced> lolol
[02:41:32] <JakeSays> merced: depends on the orm and how it's used. done right orms are fine at scale.
[02:41:39] <khanred> I'm pretty sure we're at that scale
[02:41:42] <khanred> seems to work fine
[02:41:52] <merced> JakeSays: true, but they're rarely done right at scalee
[02:41:54] <gufi_> orms work fine if you use them properly the tool can be slower than managing it all the down to serialization/deserialization but honestly that amoutn of time is nothing compared to how fast the code went out until 3-4 years later the project is dead and the next project is starting anyway
[02:42:07] <merced> gufi_: 100% lmao
[02:42:31] <guideX> my experience with orms is like: lots of things incompatible, and truly super complicated to get it to work
[02:42:33] <JakeSays> gufi_: that's very true. orms save money up front
[02:42:39] <Nasp> People fuck up just as much without orms
[02:42:40] <guideX> and to do simple things properly
[02:42:45] <guideX> and the performance is shit in the end anyways
[02:43:07] <gufi_> Nasp, even more fun is when its only a runtime error because it lacked type checking =D
[02:43:08] <guideX> but idk, maybe that's the result of where I've worked, and what kind of teams I have worked with
[02:43:19] <merced> ORM performance is why we had to contract a $200-hour/engineer shop to figure out why our application was lagging so fucking BADLY
[02:43:47] <gufi_> guideX, i've had queries under shitty old EF4 that were 800 lines like ( no joke ) that returned in less than 200 ms
[02:43:49] <Nasp> gufi_:  Yeah :D
[02:43:50] <guideX> but anyways, I'm not really arguing for or against orms, my company has a different problem (slow old shitty database server)
[02:44:09] <Nasp> Like how slow is it
[02:44:12] <guideX> gufi_, yeah usually the problems I've had with EF were with older EF
[02:44:14] <Nasp> How simple is the data it's getting?
[02:44:24] <gufi_> you cant get older than EF4
[02:44:24] <guideX> Nasp, the processing is way too much

[02:44:58] <gufi_> merced, yup, it was one of my greater achievements when i worked at tyler tech
[02:45:00] <guideX> this is why it must be dummed down in intermediary tables first, then cached to json

[02:45:32] <merced> khanred: why would you leave when you can say "its the database's fault we're late on this project"
[02:45:43] <Suchiman> JakeSays: do i wanna know?
[02:45:47] <guideX> merced, they don't want me riding my bike to work, and that makes me angry
[02:45:54] <guideX> merced, so I'm leaving
[02:46:01] <khanred> tf
[02:46:06] <guideX> idk they're jerks
[02:46:13] <merced> wtf you're going to the office?
[02:46:18] <gufi_> i took queries in EF that were taking some where in the 30-40 min range and getting them to run in 200-800ms range all because missing indexes, pisspoor datamanagement within the query, both or some times people just being fucking lazy and letting it do lazy loading
[02:46:24] <guideX> yeah they asked me to return to work about 2 months ago
[02:46:29] <merced> fuck that
[02:46:33] <khanred> needs to be close to the servers because latency
[02:46:34] <guideX> unfortunately, my wife takes the car now
[02:46:51] <guideX> so I take my bike or run to work, but they're like, stuck up
[02:47:02] <khanred> that makes no fucking sense
[02:47:08] <khanred> Why do they care
[02:47:21] <guideX> they think it's unprofessional, or maybe equate bikes with homeless
[02:47:22] <merced> khanred: just get a VDI infrastructure!
[02:47:25] <guideX> I'm not real sure honestly
[02:47:31] <merced> guideX: wtf are you in san fran?
[02:47:31] <Nasp> Why can't you bike to work?
[02:47:33] <khanred> B.O.?
[02:47:42] *** Quits: Gaboradon_ (~Gaboradon@cpe-86-58-57-5.static.triera.net) (Quit: Shutdown)
[02:47:43] <guideX> merced, long beach ca
[02:47:44] <merced> lol
[02:47:51] <khanred> wtf
[02:47:56] <Nasp> It's not really any of their business how you get to work
[02:47:58] <merced> my old office had a locker and showers for people that biked to work
[02:47:59] <khanred> I assumed this was some shitty eastern european country
[02:47:59] <guideX> these are like, orange county assholes I guess
[02:47:59] <merced> it was awesome
[02:48:08] <JakeSays> guideX: how you get to work is none of their fucking business, unless they're paying for it
[02:48:09] <Nasp> They probably prefer you being as lazy as possible in your way of getting to work
[02:48:11] <guideX> they think you must arrive in a car, or you're homeless
[02:48:32] <JakeSays> but yeah i could totally see that attitude in OC
[02:48:32] <khanred> Even if you're homeless idk how that's their concern
[02:48:32] <merced> guideX: oh man just wait til they hear about this thing "public transit"
[02:48:52] <guideX> JakeSays, at first, I had NO PROBLEMS, telling them everything honestly, but they abused the transportation part after wfh ended
[02:49:00] <guideX> so I just lie to them
[02:49:09] <guideX> "oh yea, a car, I arrived in a car, sure."
[02:49:26] <merced> no employee of MINE is going to BIKE to work!
[02:49:31] <gufi_> rofl
[02:49:49] <merced> also fuck any manager or middle management that forces you to go to the office in 2021
[02:49:52] <JakeSays> man i'd definitely lie to them - "yeah, had to walk again. 10 miles. look, my shoes have holes in the souls!"
[02:49:53] <merced> like what the hel;l
[02:49:53] <guideX> sometimes, I hide my bike in my office when I bring my better bike
[02:50:21] <guideX> I put trash around it https://dgtzuqphqg23d.cloudfront.net/G4mOTTeh9LYwoEndeY77jZnuZSgsAhWY48lXJV3bsR4-2048x1536.jpg
[02:50:28] <guideX> so it looks like some random junk in my office
[02:50:33] <khanred> ._.
[02:50:39] <khanred> THis is just sad
[02:51:09] <merced> guideX: LOL
[02:51:15] <merced> what the serious fuck
[02:51:18] <guideX> yeah D: hehe
[02:51:29] <guideX> it's really dumb place, with sql 2000 and hidden bikes
[02:51:43] <guideX> can't wait to get outta here LOL
[02:51:45] <khanred> You can't write this shit
[02:51:47] <JakeSays> lol that pic was worth switching monitors to see
[02:51:54] <merced> just tell your mgr that your bike powers the generaator for your sql server to run
[02:52:02] <guideX> merced, haha
[02:52:18] <JakeSays> i'd so be fucking with them
[02:53:13] <guideX> I mean I don't mind running or riding my bike, I workout a lot but it kinda sucks I have to hide it etc
[02:53:32] <JakeSays> you don't have to hide anything
[02:53:33] <guideX> it's their fault I ride my bike: My wife has to go to work: my job doesn't provide good health insurance
[02:53:34] <gufi_> you dont have to hide it
[02:53:51] <guideX> if my wife wasn't working, I'd take the car, and arrive in a car etc
[02:53:58] <guideX> so it's THEIR fault too
[02:54:03] <khanred> This is some  third world shit
[02:54:06] <gufi_> being in cali if any one gave you shit for it you could eat their pockets
[02:54:15] <JakeSays> guideX: actually it's not their fault. you let them do it.
[02:54:25] <guideX> well yeah, by staying
[02:54:32] <JakeSays> no, by letting them do it
[02:54:36] <khanred> Just show up with a gun
[02:54:37] <gufi_> no... by letting them at all
[02:54:41] <guideX> khanred, lol
[02:54:52] <gufi_> in cali that would not be wise
[02:54:56] <khanred> I actually felt a little bad for saying that
[02:55:06] <guideX> khanred, it's ok it was funny thogh
[02:55:09] <guideX> though*
[02:55:11] <gufi_> some one might burn them self with coffee and he'd take the L for it
[02:55:15] <khanred> Even in Oklahoma we have to go through metal detectors to get into the office
[02:55:29] * gufi_ so happy to be 100% remote
[02:55:30] <JakeSays> khanred: really?
[02:55:34] <JakeSays> gufi_: same
[02:55:34] <khanred> JakeSays, yeah
[02:55:40] <Nasp> Damn, so you can't bring your gun to the office?
[02:55:41] <khanred> thankfully I go in one day a week and the rest is WFH
[02:55:44] <gufi_> i've wanted this life for soooo fucking long
[02:55:52] <JakeSays> i had to do the metal detector thing when the 2002 olympics came to town
[02:55:53] <khanred> Nasp, I mean you can but you have to be a bit creative
[02:56:06] <gufi_> here in GA i think they'd get sued , def in texas =D
[02:56:07] <Nasp> We are supposed to show up once a week
[02:56:11] <guideX> so that's not the end of it, there's another guy ALSO hiding his bike at work in another spot in the office http://busfights.com/otherguysbike.jpg
[02:56:25] <guideX> I would use this spot, but he's already using it
[02:56:28] <JakeSays> gufi_: yeah well texas.. dont get me started
[02:56:29] <gufi_> ... bus fights .com?
[02:56:41] <guideX> gufi_, a personal site I'm working on, personal project ect
[02:56:42] <Nasp> Are those management dudes heavy weight champions?
[02:56:45] <gufi_> the fuck kinda sites yyou running dude...
[02:57:00] <guideX> gufi_, I want it to be like 9 videos of bus arguments and fights paginated basically
[02:57:04] <guideX> with a funny logo of some kind
[02:57:06] <guideX> nothing fancy
[02:57:19] <guideX> mostly people arguing over covid, right now I just put images though
[02:57:30] <gufi_> cant you just use r/publictransit like every one else?
[02:58:10] <khanred> Sounds like you just are attracted to shitstorms, guideX
[02:58:15] <guideX> well the domain name was cheap and available, thought maybe I could make something interesting (I also ride the bus sometimes and record people arguing about covid so it's perfect)
[02:58:57] <guideX> orange county I see a lot of arguments on the bus, mainly about masks and covid
[02:59:16] <khanred> Kind of glad OC is constantly on fire
[02:59:32] <guideX> orange county is crazy! the people here are kinda nuts!
[02:59:40] <khanred> I've heard
[02:59:42] <gufi_> guide... pretty sure in cali its a 2 concent state so... be careful with that
[02:59:55] <guideX> gufi_, I think as long as I'm not selling anything should be ok
[03:00:00] <guideX> also you can just take the content down
[03:00:07] <Nasp> Orange County Choppers!
[03:00:51] <guideX> the saddest part about all of this is I need to leave my commuting bike locked up at starbucks for like 8 hours and hope no one steals it :(
[03:01:11] <Nasp> We have bike parking
[03:01:15] <khanred> same
[03:01:20] <khanred> This is some of the craziest shit i've heard
[03:01:25] <Nasp> And space for like 30 cars for 1300 people
[03:01:30] <guideX> I wish I could say, I was trolling, I am not
[03:01:33] <guideX> this is my life now LOL
[03:01:53] <khanred> We have two parking garages, but they're tearing up one of the ground level parking lots for a new building
[03:03:06] <Nasp> For some reason when you build anything new now, you don't have to build parking anymore
[03:03:24] <Nasp> You can remov 100 parking places, and build new apartments for 500 people and just dont make any parking
[03:03:25] <khanred> I assume you live in a country with decent public transit
[03:03:32] <Nasp> Define decent
[03:03:43] <khanred> it exists
[03:03:47] <Nasp> Sure it exists
[03:03:55] <Nasp> The reason people use it, is because parking and using cars is hell
[03:03:58] <Nasp> And 200% tax on cars
[03:04:00] <khanred> There's zero commuter rail here
[03:05:54] <guideX> I had trouble adjusting to commuting to work without a car, but I think I'm happier this way
[03:06:04] <guideX> at first I was like, running to work a lot
[03:06:10] <khanred> It's healthier at least
[03:06:15] <khanred> Until you get hit by a car
[03:06:15] <guideX> then my clavicle healed, I could ride the bike again, and that's much easier
[03:06:33] <guideX> (I broke my clavicle at some point, but it's healed now etc)
[03:06:57] <Nasp> So this is the world latest prime atm "2^82589933-1", how much memory does such a beast even take up
[03:07:54] <guideX> the best thing about taking not a car to work: you feel accomplished already when you get to work
[03:08:18] <khanred> lolwhat
[03:08:41] <guideX> khanred, well, maybe you beat a PR running or cycling, or maybe you burned through a lot of calories etc
[03:08:46] <khanred> oh nvm I'm illiterate
[03:10:47] <Nasp> I kinda want one of those walking desks
[03:11:08] <khanred> I've read up on them and apparently its awful
[03:11:31] <Nasp> Really?
[03:11:51] <khanred> yeah
[03:12:19] <guideX> idk which is a worse workaround, caching things to json, or bike hiding.. I guess I'm just full of workarounds :/
[03:12:35] <khanred> Your life sounds terrible
[03:12:52] <guideX> ah things aren't bad :P
[03:13:04] <guideX> got some transportation issues, I'm fine
[03:16:06] <Nasp> khanred:  What's so terrible about them
[03:16:28] <Nasp> How the hell do i even initialize a huge biginteger
[03:16:38] <khanred> THey were talking about how it was difficult to type and shit even at the lowest speed
[03:16:59] <guideX> var myBigInteger = new BigInteger(50000000000000000000000000000000000000000000);
[03:17:05] <guideX> eh maybe :)
[03:17:24] <guideX> var myBigInteger = BigInteger.Parse("50000000000000000000000000000000000000000000");
[03:19:11] <Nasp> Not big enough :D

[03:21:05] <Nasp> BigInteger.Pow(2, 82589933) Yeah this might take a whole :D
[03:21:15] <Nasp> Although if i just take one digit of, then it's fast
[03:34:15] <irwiss> to be fair 2^8258933 is just 1 with 8258932 zeroes after it in binary, so you might be able to precompute and put as constant
[03:38:54] <Nasp> irwiss:  That's a good point
[03:40:49] <Nasp> irwiss:  Yeah i dont think that helps with the speed
[03:41:04] <Nasp> Or did you mean precompuate as in put it incode?
[03:42:29] <irwiss> i suppose, don't know how it stores value internally, but if in binary sure

[03:47:53] *** Joins: jamea (~jamea@177.239.80.39)
[03:49:13] <irwiss> you could also calculate it once, grab the ToByteArray() it has, then load it into constructor overload, i'm like 90% sure array load will be faster than computing pow even if they do tricks... but that'll work only for constants :P

[03:56:45] <guideX> those elev runs are a killer, like this one https://www.strava.com/activities/4861137786
[03:56:52] <Nasp> irwiss:  It seems faster if i could just figure out how to manipulate the correct bit
[03:57:55] <Nasp> Do you also run same distance home
[03:58:02] <Nasp> And that was a run just to catch the bus?
[03:58:36] <guideX> Nasp, when I cycle, I cycle to work and back the entire 18 miles/28.96km, but if I'm running, I just need to make it to the bus in the morning, and take the bus back later\
[03:58:46] <guideX> sometimes my wife picks me up after her work
[03:59:05] <Nasp> I take it you have a decent bike then?
[03:59:18] *** Quits: khanred (~khanred@user/khanred) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:59:47] <guideX> unfortunately if I want to be on time, I must run the 13.1 miles/21km to make it to the bus stop and to work on time.. yeah I have two bikes, a vintage 1980's raleigh road bike, and a modern fuji sla-1.3 road bike http://skywirenews.com/bikes.jpg
[03:59:55] <guideX> Nasp, they're both very good bikes
[03:59:59] <guideX> even the raleigh is just great
[04:00:16] <Nasp> And you leave that outside a starbucks?
[04:00:18] <Nasp> How often have it been stolen
[04:00:28] <guideX> Nasp, no one has messed with it yet!
[04:00:39] <guideX> the raleigh sits there at a busy starbucks for 8 hours like 3-4 days a week
[04:00:40] <Nasp> Leave a nice bike here and it will be gone instantly
[04:00:51] <Nasp> So i have a shitty bike
[04:01:00] <guideX> I don't put my fuji bike at starbucks, because I paid 2200$ for it LOL
[04:01:06] <guideX> but the raleigh was cheap, 300$
[04:01:43] <Nasp> I think mines $900
[04:01:45] <Nasp> It's quite crappy
[04:02:06] <Nasp> I wanted a new one, and i should have gone with my feeling and not buying this cheap biuke
[04:02:13] <Nasp> It feels like someone slamming the brakes all the time
[04:02:44] <guideX> Nasp, imo, if you're going for a road bike, should always be the sort of shimano 105 (and up) type bikes unless you're looking for a commuter
[04:02:50] <guideX> those run like idk, 2000$ or more
[04:03:06] <guideX> but it's well worth it compared to buying a shit bike of some sort with terrible chinese components
[04:03:27] <guideX> if you're a dentist, you buy the 5k bikes ofc xD
[04:03:30] <Nasp> For some reason there's never chain guard in good bikes
[04:04:37] <guideX> those are good for mountain bikes I guess
[04:04:45] <guideX> I need a mountain bike, I don't have one atm
[04:06:09] <Nasp> I had a mountain bike
[04:06:16] <Nasp> Then i got a haircut and it was gone
[04:06:22] <guideX> oh man
[04:07:00] <guideX> I stopped cycling for like 20-25 years because of that.. I was a small boy, and locked up my bike at school, and someone watched me as I put the code into the combination lock, and saw the code, and stole it later
[04:07:17] <guideX> I didn't get back into bikes until this year, at 42 years old LOL
[04:08:05] <guideX> so sorry F:
[04:08:41] <Nasp> I want death penalty for bike theft

[07:52:56] <sysRPL> nah i know exactly what the problem is
[07:53:43] <sysRPL> the problem is these kids are all schooling from home, and their parents attempt to monitor their life online and offline

[07:55:43] <sysRPL> if only their parents checked their school work, but then gave them the freedom in the rest of their life, these kids wouldn't be so messed up

[07:56:31] <sysRPL> and the kids have learned to lie and conceal

[07:58:11] <sysRPL> i can discern all this ... and their parent are oblivious ... even when i talk about the problem with them

[12:35:14] <MatthiasVance> If you're already swapping then you already know what happens to the settings and your code etc so I guess that's fine?
[12:35:26] <MatthiasVance> Those were my two main "surprises"
[12:36:16] <MatthiasVance> So, I read something on Twitter about how VS 2022 can break stuff with .NET 5.0 or something if you don't have a global.json - it was MAYBE related to F# .. so now that I'm setting up exactly this I need to go find it back
[12:37:11] <MaNa3k> MatthiasVance, well our settings dosnt get swaped which is kind of good
[12:37:22] <MatthiasVance> Yeah you have to check a checkbox for that iirc
[12:37:23] <MaNa3k> dont know if thats by default or a setting we have set
[12:37:27] <MaNa3k> ah
[12:37:28] <MaNa3k> i se
[12:37:30] <MaNa3k> lol
[12:37:38] <MatthiasVance> So if you don't know that, you might get surprised :D
[12:37:55] <MaNa3k> mhm
[12:38:09] <MatthiasVance> So apparently my office is 21.7C but it still feels cold. Temps are also dropping way faster than living room, if I make it 21.7C there, it will be HOT
[12:38:15] <MatthiasVance> Needs better insulation I guess :D
[12:38:32] <MatthiasVance> Also take that 21.7C with a grain of salt, sensor is next to the radiator
[12:38:44] <MatthiasVance> (but so am I .. so ..)
[12:39:00] <MaNa3k> MatthiasVance, windows are the first place you should check for leaks
[12:39:19] <MatthiasVance> Yeah they are single pane
[12:39:23] <MatthiasVance> So that doesn't help :D
[12:39:26] <MaNa3k> also, windows them selfs arnt really insulated well, some film on theirs

[12:40:46] <MatthiasVance> other than air, of course
[12:41:13] <MaNa3k> MatthiasVance, you should also not get one of those that are too good at insulating, because otherwise your house will fell like a greenhouse
[12:41:22] <MaNa3k> in summer

[15:29:34] <MaNa3k> this one is now easy, but there are some that are alittle more difficult
[15:29:45] <inceptionflywho> its a math question
[15:30:40] <sysRPL> a sample q: if couples in china wanted only male children, and stopped trying to have chodlren after their first male child, how would this change the ratio of the male to female population in china?
[15:31:04] <sysRPL> ^ an actual math question from a text ^
[15:31:33] <sysRPL> does anyone know the answer?
[15:31:42] <biberu> there's not enough information to answer
[15:31:46] <inceptionflywho> sysRPL, the root cause here: https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1002092/chinese-couples-want-boys-—-trust-me,-im-a-fertility-doctor
[15:31:54] <sysRPL> sure there is enough information
[15:32:07] <biberu> sysRPL: it's asking hot it would change from a current unknown state
[15:32:26] <sysRPL> no it isn't. you don't understand the problem
[15:32:37] <biberu> "how would this change the ratio"
[15:32:40] <biberu> change from what?
[15:32:49] <sysRPL> and that's the point, there is one easy answer
[15:33:06] <inceptionflywho> the answer is infinity!
[15:33:14] <biberu> any beyond! /o/
[15:33:18] <sysRPL> the answer is it won't change anything
[15:33:33] <inceptionflywho> if there are no females left then the equation would be males/0 = ♾
[15:33:56] <sysRPL> stopping having children at the first male child will keep the same ratio of men to women
[15:34:29] <inceptionflywho> how? after the current fertile generation, there won't be any female in the society
[15:34:42] <inceptionflywho> only male child
[15:34:59] <sysRPL> wrong
[15:35:03] <sysRPL> do it on paper
[15:35:11] <MaNa3k> sysRPL, it depends, wather its really 50/50 change of getting males or females in china
[15:35:32] <inceptionflywho> since the question is vague, I interpret it as everyone having only male as their first child
[15:35:59] <sysRPL> work it out ... say 1 couple has a child, the chance of it being male is 50%
[15:36:04] <inceptionflywho> if you imply that they keep trying until the first child and in process keep all the previous female babies, then the question is not worth pursuing
[15:36:10] <MaNa3k> sysRPL, so can they have more than 1 childer?
[15:36:19] <sysRPL> so that results in half the population being female and half male
[15:36:20] <inceptionflywho> since you don't know the outcome in advance!
[15:36:38] <sysRPL> sure they can have as many as they want, but they stop after the first male child
[15:36:41] <inceptionflywho> sysRPL, how do you know it is 50%
[15:36:51] <sysRPL> the ratio of men to women stays the same if they do that
[15:36:52] <MaNa3k> if they can only have 1 children, then the population will surely go down, because you need atleast 2 childer for the population to not increase or decrease
[15:37:13] <inceptionflywho> MaNa3k, if you have exactly 2, the population would actually go down
[15:37:20] <sysRPL> inceptionflywho: stopping having children isn't going to change the ratio
[15:37:47] <MaNa3k> inceptionflywho, practically yes, because early death, accidents, war, etc
[15:37:54] <sysRPL> the ratio of men to women stays the same regardless of if the stop after having a male child
[15:37:56] <inceptionflywho> MaNa3k, precisely
[15:38:16] <sysRPL> inceptionflywho: you failed. sorry.
[15:38:21] <biberu> sysRPL: is it supposed to be interpreted over many generations, or one?
[15:38:22] <inceptionflywho> sysRPL, there is no science in your argument
[15:38:26] <sysRPL> lol
[15:38:40] <sysRPL> it's a simple math problem. try writing it out on paper and see for yourself
[15:39:14] <sysRPL> it doesn't matter what the percentages are .... stopping after the first male child will not change the percentage at all
[15:39:30] <sysRPL> try writing it out on paper and see for yourself
[15:39:33] <inceptionflywho> sysRPL, https://utswmed.org/medblog/it-boy-or-girl-fathers-family-might-provide-clue/
[15:40:17] <inceptionflywho> it might also be impacted by other factors. There is no guarantee that nature would give more girls to a population if everyone wants to stop at the first male child
[15:41:37] <sysRPL> god you are dense ... look take any percentage rate of births of girls to boys okay?
[15:41:55] <sysRPL> then apply it to 1 cuple ... what are the chances they have a boy or girl child?
[15:42:18] <sysRPL> the percentage doesn't change
[15:42:52] <biberu> sure it does
[15:42:56] <sysRPL> okay how?
[15:43:12] <sysRPL> lets sya it way 58.6 to 47.4
[15:43:21] <sysRPL> would having 1 child change that percentage?
[15:43:44] <biberu> if you start with an even set of couples and each couple keeps having children until they have a male child, there'll be more females in the new generation, which changes the ratio in the population
[15:44:11] <sysRPL> it doesn't matter. the percentage won't change based on stopping at the first boy
[15:44:36] <sysRPL> some of you here are quite dense

[16:06:38] <sysRPL> take 1 couple okay?
[16:06:41] <canton7> sysRPL, nice, agreed it's 0.5. For N couples, there are N boys, but N/4 + N/8 + N/16 + ... girls. So the proportion of girls is 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ... which is sum(n=0 to infinity) 1/(2^(n+2)), which is 0.5.

[16:15:47] <canton7> Still drops out mathematically if you have any probability of boy/girl. Lets say P(boy) = 'p', P(girl) = '1 - p'. Now the probability of getting 1 girl is p(1-p), the probability of 2 girls is p(1-p)^2, 3 girls is p(1-p)^3, etc. So for a population size N, the number of boys is N, and the number of girls is Np(1-p) + Np(1-p)^2 + Np(1-p)^3 + ...

[16:20:19] <inceptionflywho> canton7, it is the same population (parents), but the second born would still have same number of boys and girls is not realistic.
[16:20:38] <inceptionflywho> first 100 couples had 46 male and 54 female
[16:20:43] <canton7> inceptionflywho, so you're changing the probability of a girl based on the number of children a couple has?
[16:20:51] <inceptionflywho> no, it is random
[16:21:20] <canton7> Right, but throughout the population, everyone who has 2 children has a different probability of having a girl, to everyone who has 1 child?
[16:22:09] <inceptionflywho> people with first child as boy are eliminated. But I spot an issue with the calculation already
[16:23:01] <inceptionflywho> Parents stop having kids after their first male child
[16:23:09] <canton7> But still, you've linked a couple's probability of having a boy to the number of girls they have...
[16:23:21] <inceptionflywho> so the remaining parents should be (Previous Parents - Parents with a boy child)
[16:23:26] <tlf> I love seeing families with like, 3 girls and a boy
[16:23:41] <canton7> The 50% of your population of have 1 girl have a different probability of having a girl, thoughout both births, as the 25% of the population with 2 girls
[16:23:43] <tlf> because you know they only really wanted 2 kids, but one had to be a boy and they were'nt giving up
[16:24:06] <inceptionflywho> Updated -> https://pasteboard.co/eTI018Pk70Y9.png
[16:24:42] <inceptionflywho> Population should be termed as "Parents still trying to have babies"
[16:24:46] <earthy> heh. Our oldest is a boy, but we didn't quite stop there. :)
[16:25:01] <earthy> (the other 2 are girls)
[16:25:14] <tlf> or yeah, the reverse
[16:25:16] <canton7> inceptionflywho, but still, why is there a different probability for everyone who needed to have 3 girls, vs everyone who needed to have 4?
[16:25:52] <canton7> Why does the probability change at all through the population? Surely the way to define the probability of having a boy is across the *whole* population?
[16:26:14] <canton7> Because if you're not defining it that way, you've got something really weird which isn't just P(boy)
[16:26:23] <inceptionflywho> canton7, it is because you would never know if the next born is a boy or a girl for every time there is a new born
[16:26:30] <inceptionflywho> lets say 100 parents have babies
[16:26:36] <inceptionflywho> we can say 45 boys and 55 girls
[16:26:42] <canton7> Right, but that's the point of it being a *probability* :P
[16:26:52] <inceptionflywho> if those 100 parents have babies again ... how can you have a definite number?
[16:27:02] <inceptionflywho> so it is a random deviation around 0.5
[16:27:08] <canton7> Because each birth is an independent event, unaffected by previous births?
[16:27:13] <inceptionflywho> exactly
[16:27:22] <canton7> But the *mean* stays the same
[16:27:37] <inceptionflywho> but the ratios do remain near equal as stated by foulmouthed sysRPL
[16:27:53] <canton7> If each birth is independent, why are you changing the probability based on the number of children a couple has?
[16:28:01] <inceptionflywho> it is not based on children
[16:28:04] <canton7> Surely that's the opposite of independent?
[16:28:14] <inceptionflywho> it is randomly generated
[16:28:18] <canton7> It is -- your "1 child" group has a different P(boy) to your "2 child" group
[16:28:28] <inceptionflywho> Imagine a forumla = RANDBETWEEN(25,75)/100
[16:28:28] <canton7> This isn't how probabilities work, heh
[16:28:46] <canton7> You don't change the *probability* to account for the fact that real-world doesn't match up with probabilities exactly
[16:29:07] <inceptionflywho> consider it like a ratio in real world
[16:29:19] <inceptionflywho> it is a deviation around 0.5 even split
[16:30:16] *** Joins: exvicesindaco (~exvicio@user/exvicesindaco)
[16:30:31] <canton7> If you're running *simulations*, then each *individual* birth will be random
[16:30:45] <canton7> But over the entire population, p(boy) will be constant. Because that's how p(boy) is defined
[16:31:08] <canton7> It's the probility of any *individual*, *independent* birth resulting in a boy
[16:32:24] <canton7> You're sort of mixing together the concept of a simulation, and the concept of probabilities, in a weird way. By adjusting the probabilities themselves (based on a arbitrary metric, which is the number of births a couple has), rather than the random numbers which are generated to follow those probabilities
[16:33:02] <canton7> It's sort-of a simulation, but without the separation between the actual probability, and the real-world randomness which meets the probability
[16:34:07] <canton7> And if you're running a simulation, then *every* birth needs to be random, and uncorrelated with every other birth. At the moment, all of your 2nd births are all locked together with the same % resulting in a boy, which is just weird

[22:57:57] <Nasp> But it's kinda like SMSS in disguise
[23:00:11] <mannu> i use dbeaver

[23:06:12] <ki9a> JakeSays wears these https://www.ajournalofmusicalthings.com/wp-content/uploads/Koss-headphones-1950s-1024x619.jpg
[23:09:07] <inceptionflywho> qualifies to be ancestor of bose!
[23:09:52] <ki9a> Bose is overrated
[23:09:56] <ki9a> their hardware is ugly
[23:10:01] <ki9a> their software is worse
[23:10:22] <ki9a> and the quality is more about what other people think of it than what it really is
[23:12:29] <blez> first time I hear this as an opinion
[23:12:51] <blez> bose sounds awesome, everytime I tried it
[23:13:01] <blez> their software isn't great, tbh

[23:42:07] <MichaelLong> we're quite international here I assume
[23:43:28] <bomb> 80% European
[23:44:50] <MichaelLong> that basically mirrors what I said
[23:45:30] <bomb> "100% European" would mirror what you said as well
[23:46:43] <MichaelLong> :]
[23:47:05] <bomb> even 100% Benelux is technically international :P
