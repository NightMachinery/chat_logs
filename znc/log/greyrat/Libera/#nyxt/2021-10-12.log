[17:04:41] <mariari> hmm yeah I came back from abroad and nyxt is still very crashy on my main computer for some reason. good note is that it doesn't crash much on my laptop
[19:21:05] <rdrg109> I want to create a function that gets the N part of a URL. N would be set by a prefix argument. Unfortunately, nyxt doesn't support functions that handle prefix arguments. Anyways, here's an example: Given this URL: https://foo.com/x/y/z. C-u 0 <<key>> copies "foo.com". C-u 1 <<key>> copies "x". C-u 2 <<key>> copies "y". C-u 3 <<key>>  copies "z".
[19:21:39] <rdrg109> Is there something similar to this Emacs sexp (completing-read "Prompt: " '("a" "b" "c"))  but in Nyxt?
[20:09:14] <jmercouris> rdrg109: no need to use a prefix argument
[20:09:30] <jmercouris> If you put a regular argument in a command, Nyxt will prompt you for the value of said argument
[20:09:43] <aartaka> rdrg109: The closest thing is creating the prompter source to use minibuffer for the choice.
[20:10:01] <jmercouris> With regards to getting a specific part of a URL, we use the Quri library which will give you any part of the URL you want
[20:10:23] <jmercouris> aartaka: no need to create a prompter source!
[20:10:56] <jmercouris> Just make a command with a required argument in its lambda list
[20:11:15] <aartaka> Or, as jmercouris said, just have (define-command url-split (&optional (part (prompt :sources (list (make-instance 'prompter:raw-source))))) ...)
[20:11:18] <jmercouris> Or, make it optional and then run execute extended command
[20:11:55] <jmercouris> OR put a watermelon on your head
[20:11:59] <jmercouris> Either way works
[20:12:03] <aartaka> Parse the part with `parse-integer` and decide which `quri:uri-*` function you need.
[20:12:33] <jmercouris> aartaka: you’ll automatically be prompted for arguments in commands that are required!
[20:12:35] <aartaka> rdrg109: did I understand you right?
[20:12:41] <jmercouris> This is relatively new functionality
[20:12:44] <jmercouris> You can just write
[20:12:48] <aartaka> jmercouris: WHAT?
[20:13:00] <aartaka> I don't believe.
[20:13:01] <jmercouris> (Define-command xyz (fish) …)
[20:13:09] <jmercouris> And you’ll be prompted for fish
[20:13:21] <jmercouris> Now, I’m pretty sure this exists, or I had a very vivid dream
[20:14:24] <aartaka> jmercouris: does argument type influence it too, or is it just `prompter:raw-source`? And is it in `execute-extended-command` or just calling a required arg command?

[20:14:57] <jmercouris> It will do verification

[20:15:11] <aartaka> That's crazy cool!
[20:16:21] <jmercouris> Just calling a required arg command
[20:16:27] <jmercouris> All that is necessary
[20:16:52] <jmercouris> Eg, regular execute command will also invoke
[20:17:34] <jmercouris> Also don’t forget to put a watermelon on your head
[20:17:42] <jmercouris> That helps to solve these kinds of problems
[20:17:55] <jmercouris> aartaka: ^
[20:18:02] <aartaka> jmercouris: That's yet another motivation for me to go through all the commands we have and make them non-interactive-friendly :)
[20:18:14] <jmercouris> :-D
[20:18:33] <aartaka> jmercouris: And putting watermelon on my head is going to help me with that, for sure.
[20:18:39] <jmercouris> Indeed
[20:18:49] <jmercouris> Of that I’m certain
[20:18:55] <jmercouris> Few things in life are a given
[20:49:39] <rdrg109> aartaka: tbh, I don't know what is "prompter source", "quri", "required argument", but I have time to learn that, then I'll share what I get to do.
[20:50:16] <rdrg109> Also, I will also try to put a watermelon in my head and I hope the fish trick works too.
[21:01:33] <jmercouris> Good luck with the melon rdrg109
[21:03:27] <rdrg109> btw, does nyxt have a wikipedia article yet? I'm asking because I'm creating an entity in Wikidata: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q108877087
[21:05:11] <waleee> they are famously stingy with new IT/programming languages/tech(nology) articles, eg. zig had it's article removed multiple times
[21:06:52] <jmercouris> rdrg109: no, feel free to create the Wikipedia article
[21:07:17] <jmercouris> I will consider it a mark of our success when someone makes a Wikipedia article about us

[22:49:16] <jmercouris> Thanks
[23:05:54] <hendursaga> Is it just me or does latest master have a LOT of _build/ directories that are not properly gitignore'd??!
[23:09:16] <hendursaga> OK this just keeps getting weirder...
[23:09:19] <waleee> the submodule pr was merged
[23:09:55] <hendursaga> well apparently it's missing alexandria now..
[23:10:50] <hendursaga> https://dpaste.org/3qEp
[23:11:37] <hendursaga> which looks odd because _build/alexandria exists, for one
[23:11:48] <waleee> hendursaga: you need to initialize the submodules
[23:13:08] <hendursaga> waleee: so should I have git clone'd with --recursive or...?
[23:14:01] <hendursaga> or do I have to git submodule init etc only AFTER running make all or..?
[23:14:48] <hendursaga> whatever is the new workflow, it might be nice to update https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/documents/README.org#fetch-the-source-code
[23:16:34] <hendursaga> also wouldn't that mean Nyxt is no longer using Quicklisp...?!
[23:17:32] <waleee> reading from the pr it is intended to be optional
[23:19:32] <waleee> hendursaga: git submodule init & git submodule update is for when you haven't cloned with --recursive &c (if I remember correctly & the search hits are correct)
[23:19:47] <hendursaga> waleee: well, neither of them work
[23:23:58] <waleee> seems to work for me, loads of "cloning into"
[23:26:16] <hendursaga> I just get "checked out" messages..
[23:27:09] <hendursaga> I'm gonna try a brand-new clone with --recursive
[23:33:27] <hendursaga> OK now it's cloning
[23:33:38] <hendursaga> Still, docs should be updated to mention --recursive
