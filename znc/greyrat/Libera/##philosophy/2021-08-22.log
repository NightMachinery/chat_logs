[01:40:50] <PrincessPeachie> How many hours a day do you dedicate to hate?
[01:40:51] <PrincessPeachie> :D
[01:40:52] <Thilastiko> its not perfect, but can at least be improved. unlike religion
[01:40:55] <PrincessPeachie> I'm just wondering
[01:40:59] <Franciman> science has an edge over analogous philosophical inquiries
[01:41:02] <PrincessPeachie> Religion is a science
[01:41:05] <PrincessPeachie> and it is a philosophy
[01:41:23] <PrincessPeachie> Religion is the science and philosophy that brought the world most sciences including math, anatomy, ect
[01:41:23] <Franciman> it requires verifying what you say
[01:41:32] <Thilastiko> philospphy is just the art of "phrasing questions"
[01:41:34] <Franciman> philosophy is: let's say I see a fluid
[01:41:39] <PrincessPeachie> The problem is that you are not very well studied in philosophy
[01:41:42] <Franciman> and nobody can say I am wrong
[01:41:51] <Franciman> sorry I mean
[01:41:52] <Thilastiko> usually you have to spend a lot of time phrasing hte question before science can even handle it
[01:41:53] <PrincessPeachie> "the scientifical truth it's much better, you shouldn't let poets lie to you"
[01:41:56] <Franciman> naturalism
[01:42:02] <Franciman> not philosophy per se
[01:42:09] <Franciman> but metaphysics is so full of crap
[01:42:18] <Franciman> boy
[01:42:24] <PrincessPeachie> Everything has is born out of a philosophical concept

[01:42:31] <Franciman> PrincessPeachie: no doubt about it
[01:42:36] <Thilastiko> Franciman: you should read Heideggers introduction to metaphysics
[01:42:38] <PrincessPeachie> Anatomy was at first philosophical
[01:42:42] <PrincessPeachie> So what you're saying makes no sense
[01:42:46] <Franciman> every move starts from philosophical act
[01:42:52] *** Joins: arcturus (~arcturus@gateway/tor-sasl/arcturus)
[01:42:54] <PrincessPeachie> there are more important things in the world than metaphysics
[01:42:58] <Franciman> but then science requires that you verify your moves
[01:42:59] <Thilastiko> its the only secular, non-supersitious-angles-and -shit version of metaphysics out there
[01:43:05] <PrincessPeachie> Philosophy is a science
[01:43:08] <Franciman> philosophical inquiries are much more vague
[01:43:27] <Franciman> nowadays they have taken part of science because it has won by too far
[01:43:36] <PrincessPeachie> However, some philosophy that is so subjective like Nietzsche the nazi or Marx gives no beneficial or concrete scientific significance
[01:43:45] <Franciman> science has discovered zillions of things in 1/10th the time philosophy was the main means of inquiry
[01:43:50] <PrincessPeachie> which is why it's only taken seriously by people with little intellect
[01:44:06] <Thilastiko> there is no bell that goes off once you find the "right philosophy", its just something you are going to have to think about forever
[01:44:11] <PrincessPeachie> this is why they complain about the the upper class
[01:44:21] <Franciman> PrincessPeachie: i think nietzsche is not worthless
[01:44:33] <PrincessPeachie> because the upper class, unless it's in a communist or nietzsche society, is more intellectual
[01:44:34] <Franciman> it's just hard to understand :P

[01:45:41] <PrincessPeachie> awww it seems like the canadian is so pissed off right now
[01:45:44] <Franciman> full of technicism
[01:45:44] <PrincessPeachie> What a wonder
[01:45:52] <Franciman> without insights and intuition
[01:45:57] <PrincessPeachie> You can continue trying to make other's days nasty
[01:46:01] <Franciman> a totally analytical society is doomed to fail
[01:46:01] <Thilastiko> before neitzch people consitered the mind to be entirely conscious, and that "unconsious mind" was a contradiction in terms
[01:46:03] <PrincessPeachie> I will continue to enjoy my day
[01:46:15] <Franciman> as we are failing
[01:46:20] * PrincessPeachie sips on her peach beer
[01:46:45] <Thilastiko> Ive got a mushroom for you princess peach

[01:49:17] <Thilastiko> its a very stimulating mushroom
[01:50:20] <PrincessPeachie> hate can only be so intriguiging
[01:50:28] <PrincessPeachie> creativity and love are so much more interesting.
[01:50:41] <Thilastiko> hate and love are the same emotion
[01:51:01] <Thilastiko> the poles of human affection are love <--> apathy
[01:51:40] <Thilastiko> hating something means you really care for it, in a certain way
[01:52:25] <Thilastiko> eventually you even become the thing you hate
[01:53:11] <Thilastiko> which is why all those anti-gay, anti-women white male republican senators have become such cock sucking little bitches

[09:18:04] <audrey> I guess lalia ragequit this channel as well
[09:18:09] <audrey> he deleted his discord account
[09:18:20] <audrey> so I guess this channel has been de facto without moderation for a while.
[09:18:21] <audrey> Sorry about that.
[09:18:46] <plankers> i was hoping they would attempt to answer my question about what the fuck a "nietszche society" is tho
[09:18:50] <plankers> i could have used a laugh

[09:21:19] <audrey> Oh, it's whats-her-face.
[09:21:23] <audrey> She's been ban evading for a while.
[09:21:28] <audrey> Harder to do that on discord.
[09:21:32] <pussipupu> I don't even know that there are regulars I would recommend for ops to be honest
[09:21:43] <audrey> Funny how after 12+ years on IRC it just seems so antiquated now.
[09:21:43] <plankers> yeah but you can edit your comments on discord
[09:21:45] <plankers> thats a no-no
[09:21:54] <audrey> Yes. That's very :sad:.
[09:22:03] <audrey> pussipupu: such as yourself? :P
[09:22:04] <plankers> the emojis dont help either :P
[09:22:17] <pussipupu> audrey: haha no
[09:22:30] <plankers> then youre perfect!
[09:22:48] <plankers> those who want to lead should never be given the responsibility :)
[09:22:55] <pussipupu> This channel needs an active team, one person just gets worn down
[09:23:02] <plankers> agreed, comrade
[09:23:08] <plankers> perhaps a council of some sort
[09:23:12] <plankers> maybe a soviet?
[09:23:24] <audrey> ##politics tried that and ended up being ##goddamgarbage
[09:23:31] <audrey> they had voted bans and everything
[09:23:35] <plankers> well its important to experiment
[09:23:42] <plankers> otherwise how do you know what works?
[09:23:53] <audrey> lalia was fairly effective at moderating when he wanted to be
[09:24:00] <audrey> other times he would just clamp down on people he didn't like ...
[09:24:02] <plankers> i think having a loose set of guidelines is better, myself
[09:24:11] <audrey> I guess most mods are like that at some point or another, including myself
[09:24:13] <plankers> voting works best for establishing rules rather than for specific actions
[09:24:17] <pussipupu> yeah you need timezone spread too though
[09:25:04] <pussipupu> I'd be doubly unable to moderate these days as a primarily Matrix user
[09:25:43] <plankers> ive tried matrix a few times but its never hooked me
[09:25:44] <pussipupu> moderating from the other side of the bridge is painful
[09:25:52] <plankers> the thing with editing comments seems wrong
[09:26:02] <plankers> too easy for trolls to evade criticism
[09:26:41] <plankers> after all, what is said cannot be unsaid
[09:26:45] <pussipupu> I don't like history editing, but it has other features I do like
[09:26:51] <plankers> agreed
[09:26:55] <plankers> like /rainbow lol
[09:27:21] <pussipupu> there has to be some history editing though, or servers end up hosting illegal material in perpetuity
[09:27:23] * plankers asks you to imagine this text in a smorgasboard of colors
[09:27:35] <pussipupu> no, that's not a good feature
[09:27:38] <plankers> pussipupu servers dont host anything on irc
[09:27:53] <plankers> logging all occurs on the client computers
[09:27:59] <pussipupu> True but Matrix servers do, which is what I was talking about
[09:28:10] <plankers> right. another weakness of the federated system
[09:28:22] <plankers> but it is nice that information persists throughout sessions
[09:28:28] <plankers> ahhh, tradeoffs
[09:28:40] <pussipupu> though also IRC3 servers do store history IIRC
[09:28:49] <plankers> probably why it hasnt caught on :P
[09:28:57] <plankers> who wants to host a target for CSAM
[09:29:00] <plankers> yikes to that
[09:34:19] <pussipupu> Oh audrey, both Discord and Matrix were listening to our conversation about sub channels apparently :p
[09:34:33] <pussipupu> Though they call them threads and spaces respectively

[12:43:41] <plank> depends on the motivation
[12:43:55] <plank> if its to shame with the intent of causing positive change, theres a role for it
[12:44:31] <plank> but it should be done with great care

[12:48:18] <brigand> yeah
[12:48:34] * pussipupu hands arryana seedy bread with raspberry balsamic and olive oil
[12:49:13] * plank monches pringles
[12:49:18] <brigand> plank: i don't understand the bans either. it wasn't removed for princesspeachie afaics
[12:49:33] <plank> then princesspeachie is ban evading
[12:49:41] <plank> sorry to bother you audrey
[12:50:21] <brigand> idk what $a does
[12:50:38] <arryana> ooooh
[12:50:41] <plank> oh and princesspeachie i wish you luck getting off the weed. and if you tell the NSA youve _ever_ smoked cannabis, they wont take you, you fucking idiot
[12:50:42] <arryana> you're fabulous
[12:51:27] <brigand> Ban on $a:PrincessPeachie by audrey!~audrey@user/audrey, set 3 hours, 33 minutes ago
[12:51:42] <plank> arryana i told you i had it under control ;)
[12:51:47] <arryana> haha
[12:52:42] <arryana> it's all good from where i sit, i just /ignore anyone who spouts too much stupidity
[12:52:49] <plank> sure, and i do
[12:52:52] <pussipupu> also now is the time of mushroom hunting
[12:53:00] <plank> but some folks dont deserve such forbearance
[12:53:00] <arryana> i love mushroom hunting
[12:53:23] <plank> like folks who introduce themselves by insulting me
[12:54:14] <arryana> well, i admit i find it hilarious when someone who doesn't know me at all thinks they're insulting me
[12:54:30] <plank> its funny, sure
[12:54:49] <plank> but if i laugh instead of standing up for myself, theyve won in a sense
[12:55:02] <plank> its a power dynamic
[12:55:06] <arryana> anyone who actually knows me is fully aware that i couldn't give a shit for the opinions of anyone who has not earned my respect
[12:55:17] <arryana> yeah, i don't even care enough about them for that
[12:55:31] <plank> i consider IRC excellent practice for IRL
[12:55:35] <arryana> if they want to make fools of themselves by shouting into the wind, fine
[12:55:59] <arryana> i can't do that, because people respond to me in very different ways in real life and on irc
[12:56:05] <plank> there will always be those who listen to the troll and find them funny
[12:56:11] <plank> they then may emulate that behavior
[12:56:14] <plank> this should be avoided
[12:56:20] <brigand> arryana ignored me for pointing out her virtue signalling and criticising her behaviour xD
[12:56:36] <arryana> when i was younger i felt as you do
[12:56:46] <plank> ah, the energy of youth
[12:56:51] <arryana> these days, i just /ignore all the lemmings who leap off that cloff
[12:56:52] <arryana> cliff
[12:57:05] <arryana> it isn't an energy issue, it's one of where i choose to spend my time
[12:57:16] <plank> wellll
[12:57:23] <arryana> when with my friends, i still party for days.
[12:57:26] <plank> the more energy you have, the more use you can make of the time you have
[12:57:33] <arryana> i'm not convinced of that.
[12:57:38] <plank> nor am i really
[12:57:42] <plank> but ive noticed a pattern
[12:57:43] <arryana> i'm booked for a party in dallas this weekend.
[12:57:47] <plank> nice
[12:57:47] <arryana> and i can't wait
[12:58:08] <plank> my friend is coming over from oakland... well later today
[12:58:17] <arryana> ca?
[12:58:20] <plank> yep
[12:58:23] <arryana> i haven't been to oakland in years
[12:58:27] <plank> great town
[12:58:29] <arryana> i lived in san francisco in the 90s
[12:58:32] <plank> nice
[12:58:35] <plank> its changed so much
[12:58:39] * arryana nods
[12:58:49] <plank> i used to walk dogs in SF before the pandemic
[12:58:51] <arryana> i loved that chapter of my life
[12:58:56] <arryana> ha, that was my day job
[12:59:01] <plank> you see the weirdest shit in millionaires houses
[12:59:01] <arryana> my night job was as a busboy
[12:59:13] <plank> took a lot of swigs of expensive liquor :P
[12:59:15] <arryana> i still see a lot of millionaires houses.
[12:59:25] <brigand> arryana confirmed male
[12:59:27] * arryana is a private chef
[12:59:33] <plank> haha congrats
[12:59:38] <arryana> it's fun as hell
[12:59:38] <plank> not the easiest thing to pull off
[12:59:48] <plank> have you seen Pig yet?
[12:59:48] <arryana> i'm booked for san jose in september
[12:59:50] <plank> with nic cage
[12:59:52] <plank> youd LOVE it
[12:59:53] <arryana> pig?
[12:59:54] <arryana> no
[12:59:56] <plank> its a movie
[12:59:57] <arryana> what's the premise?
[13:00:00] <plank> watch it asap
[13:00:03] <plank> i wont tell you more
[13:00:09] <arryana> fair enough
[13:00:27] <arryana> my little hacker has every movie service, i'll watch it when i get to his
[13:00:34] <plank> heh
[13:00:42] <plank> i can /msg you a tracker link if you like
[13:00:51] <arryana> i suppose he counts as one of the millionaires these days too
[13:00:58] <brigand> plank: private tracker?
[13:01:02] <arryana> thanks, but i'll see him in a few days
[13:01:03] <plank> no, public
[13:01:09] <plank> as all socialist things are
[13:01:19] <plank> sure
[13:01:46] <arryana> this weekend's party is for a very good cause
[13:01:51] <plank> i have a good public tracker tho :)
[13:02:10] <arryana> one of our favorite people, her mom died a few months ago, and this weekend would have been her birthday
[13:02:12] <brigand> plank: which is?
[13:02:17] <arryana> so our friend asked that we play with her and keep her distracted
[13:02:24] <plank> 1337x dot to
[13:02:32] <brigand> oh, i see
[13:02:35] <arryana> so i'll do an all-day cooking deal where we drink and hang out
[13:02:58] <arryana> she was a marine, and can eat like one, which makes her extra fun to cook for
[13:03:16] <plank> the daughter was a marine?
[13:03:19] <arryana> yes
[13:03:19] <plank> ehhh
[13:03:20] <brigand> i mostly search on snowfl.com
[13:03:24] <arryana> she's amazing.
[13:03:31] <plank> i was a hairs breadth away from joining the air force
[13:03:33] <plank> really glad i didnt
[13:03:40] <arryana> i wanted to be a combat medic when i was young
[13:03:50] <arryana> but i have crap heart valves, so they wouldn't take me
[13:03:50] <plank> to be in service of imperialism is not a fate i want for myself
[13:03:59] <arcturus> paramedics have great stories to tell
[13:04:08] <arryana> i was only an emt, but i loved that while i did it
[13:04:12] <arryana> new york city
[13:04:13] <plank> in service *to imperialism
[13:04:34] <plank> yeah the liquor saved me from the air force
[13:04:36] <plank> jah bless
[13:04:38] <arryana> to this day it was the best adrenaline rush i've ever found
[13:04:52] <plank> still might pursue being a pilot some day
[13:04:53] <brigand> i did my conscription time
[13:05:06] <plank> want them to figure out electric planes first tho
[13:05:07] <arryana> my little hacker will get his pilot's license one day
[13:05:10] <brigand> plank: solar powered planes?
[13:05:15] <arryana> i may request that he and i go skydiving while i'm there
[13:05:15] <brigand> right
[13:05:18] <arryana> he's already been
[13:05:22] <plank> solar power would certainly be part of an electric plane
[13:05:30] <arryana> i've been rappelling, and parasailing
[13:05:32] <plank> i doubt they could run solely on that tho
[13:05:34] <arryana> but never skydiving
[13:05:41] <plank> oh skydiving is fantastic
[13:05:43] <plank> only been once
[13:05:47] <arryana> i'd love to try it
[13:05:52] <plank> you can see the curvature of the earth when you first jump
[13:06:00] <arryana> see, that's brilliant
[13:06:11] <plank> flat earthers btfo
[13:06:20] <arryana> i'd have gone before, but i was waiting for my ankle to heal up
[13:06:29] <plank> ahhhh bummer
[13:06:37] <arryana> three years ago i broke all the bones in it, so they put in a seven inch plate and ten screws
[13:06:38] <plank> theres a place near here that took me up for $100 lol
[13:06:38] <arryana> but it's fine now
[13:06:45] <plank> kinda sketch but def worth it
[13:06:47] <arryana> haha
[13:06:52] <arryana> my hacker has a place he goes
[13:06:57] <plank> on the way down the guy on my back yelled in my ear:
[13:07:20] <plank> "you see those asian guys ahead of us?! you ever played mario kart?! those guys are the shells!!!"
[13:07:28] <arryana> haha
[13:07:38] <plank> shit gets very real very fast lol

[13:08:11] <plank> need to get a helment and pads so i can do downhill
[13:08:13] <brigand> plank: i recently read about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_airship but they're slow so it might be boring xD

[13:08:20] *** Joins: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.brockwell.irccloud.com)
[13:08:28] <plank> or rather, i need to get pads
[13:08:31] <plank> found a helmet
[13:08:33] <arryana> by that i mean, i can stand up on a board and ride it in, in reasonable surf
[13:08:39] <arryana> that doesn't make me a surfer
[13:08:50] <plank> i should have taken up surfing
[13:08:53] <plank> took up sailing instead
[13:08:55] <plank> no ragrets
[13:09:01] <arryana> i can ski, again passably, but not impressively
[13:09:08] <arryana> i've never had a chance to try snowboarding yet
[13:09:11] <plank> ahh i had a traumatic experience skiing
[13:09:18] <plank> ill pass on snow sports

[13:10:09] <arryana> the hardest part of getting used to surfing is the feel of pushing the board down
[13:10:13] <plank> arryana perhaps another time ill tell you the story of why i dont ski
[13:10:19] <arryana> fair enough
[13:10:30] <plank> ill say its my dads fault
[13:10:37] <arryana> i don't mind taking a fair amount of damage for something fun
[13:10:44] <arryana> if i'm likely to break less than three bones, i'll do it
[13:10:47] <plank> it wasnt the physical damage that did it
[13:10:56] <arryana> with a plus or minus one bone variable
[13:10:58] <arryana> ah
[13:11:16] <plank> dont send your kid up on the mountain, tell him youre going to be somewhere, and then disappear
[13:11:21] <plank> not when theyre 9 years old
[13:11:22] <arryana> oh yeah, no
[13:11:24] <arryana> well
[13:11:36] <plank> before cell phones
[13:11:41] <arryana> i grew up in the 70s, so parents would do that on purpose and go back to the lodge for some peace
[13:11:47] <plank> assholes
[13:11:51] * arryana shrugs
[13:11:57] <arryana> we were just as happy to be rid of watchful eyes
[13:12:03] <plank> times change
[13:12:05] <arryana> indeed
[13:12:24] <arryana> i also had five brothers, so we moved as a pack, for the most part
[13:12:34] <plank> fuck it, im already halfway through the story
[13:12:37] <arryana> haha
[13:12:47] <plank> we had driven up there that day to meet up with family and got there before them
[13:13:03] <brigand> plank: you were alone? no friends or siblings?
[13:13:09] <plank> so i got some rentals and he sent me up the mountain by myself, knowing not a soul on the mountain but him
[13:13:12] <plank> no siblings
[13:13:20] <arryana> yeah, that changes the game
[13:13:24] <plank> he told me hed be in the restaurant
[13:13:34] <arryana> we were ten years apart, oldest and youngest
[13:13:35] <plank> when i got after eating shit several times, he was gone
[13:13:38] <plank> cue trauma
[13:13:43] <arryana> totally fair
[13:14:02] <arryana> how old were you?
[13:14:05] <brigand> 9
[13:14:07] <plank> he has yet to make it up to me, despite numerous opportunities
[13:14:09] <arryana> yike
[13:14:11] <plank> not a good man
[13:14:25] <plank> yet i live with him
[13:14:29] <plank> for now
[13:14:35] <arryana> i was lucky that way.  my father was an appalling human being when i was a kid, but he ended up a very good man.
[13:14:40] <arryana> it just took him a while.
[13:14:40] <brigand> how often did you tell him what it cause in you?
[13:14:48] <plank> i keep hoping he'll decide to change
[13:14:51] <arryana> my old man's dead a decade now.
[13:14:58] <plank> but he is a sad, lonely, disgusting individual
[13:15:03] <arryana> bummer
[13:15:06] <plank> quite
[13:15:21] <brigand> plank: ?
[13:15:23] <arryana> my mother's hard work, but i love her anyway.
[13:15:26] <plank> ive officially run out of patience anyway
[13:15:37] <plank> and am taking matters into my own hands
[13:15:39] <arryana> yeah, i find it a lot easier to deal with my mother from 6000 miles away
[13:15:54] <plank> hes sleeping downstairs. on the couch
[13:15:57] <plank> like always
[13:16:04] <arryana> i was emancipated at 14 and bailed the scene
[13:16:08] <arryana> i think that helped a lot
[13:16:09] <plank> lucky you
[13:16:11] <arryana> yeah
[13:16:25] <plank> my mom im no contact with
[13:16:29] <arryana> i don't regret that.
[13:16:34] <plank> if she cant figure out how to respect me, her problem
[13:16:38] <arryana> fair.
[13:16:56] <arryana> i have a lot of hard lines with my mother, i've been the adult in our relationship since i was seven.
[13:17:03] <plank> a lot easier after she moved across the country :P
[13:17:11] <arryana> but she got her damage the old fashioned way, she inherited it
[13:17:19] <arryana> my grandmother was a concentration camp survivor
[13:17:21] <plank> no, mother, i dont want to see you when youre in town
[13:17:37] <arryana> i knew my grandmother very well, so i can forgive a lot in my mother.
[13:17:38] <brigand> plank: why not?
[13:17:46] <plank> because she doesnt respect me
[13:18:00] <brigand> your decisions?
[13:18:06] <brigand> parents are like that
[13:18:13] <plank> sure, thats what she would probably say
[13:18:18] <plank> it doesnt matter. im a human being
[13:18:19] <brigand> doesn't mean she doesn't love you
[13:18:24] <plank> so she keeps saying
[13:18:30] <plank> i dont want her love, i want her respect
[13:18:36] <brigand> oh, ok
[13:18:44] <arryana> that seems reasonable
[13:18:52] <arryana> unless you're an axe murderer or some such
[13:18:53] <plank> yes, love is a given from mother to son
[13:18:57] <brigand> hehe
[13:18:59] <plank> it doesnt mean much
[13:19:04] <arryana> i wouldn't say that
[13:19:11] <plank> well im still mad at her
[13:19:18] <arryana> fair enough
[13:19:42] <brigand> i still meet with my dad. but we don't talk really
[13:19:47] <brigand> maybe about soccer xD
[13:19:56] <brigand> and i hate soccer
[13:19:57] <plank> also right on about your grandmother surviving the camps
[13:20:01] <plank> thats some heavy shit
[13:20:17] <arryana> i haven't been angry with my parents for decades, though more than occasionally i have to employ patience with my mother
[13:20:19] <plank> ive been to auschwitz/birkenau
[13:20:34] <arryana> she was in auschwitz.  her four brothers died in dachau
[13:20:37] <plank> fuuuuuck
[13:20:45] <arryana> my great aunt still her her tattoo when i was a kid
[13:20:54] <arryana> my grandmother had hers cut off
[13:20:55] <plank> its not the kind of thing you lose
[13:21:00] <arryana> yeah
[13:21:10] <plank> i have 666 tatted on my foot lol
[13:21:12] <arryana> i think it did a lot for my perspective, though
[13:21:16] <arryana> why?
[13:21:20] <plank> hail satan
[13:21:23] <arryana> ah
[13:21:31] <arryana> i've got a pansy on my calf
[13:21:34] <plank> (mostly a joke, but a good one)
[13:21:42] <brigand> (oh, and my mom lives close by. and she bothers me a lot xD)
[13:21:51] <arryana> it was a gift from a friend on my 40th birthday

[13:22:45] <plank> could feel the heat from the pyrotechnics :D
[13:22:47] <arryana> that was for the other half
[13:22:59] <plank> oooh i saw king crimson in oakland
[13:23:01] <arryana> i love stuff like that, a show is good even if i don't like the band
[13:23:01] <plank> what an experience
[13:23:12] <plank> even from the nosebleeds
[13:23:15] <arryana> i don't really get them.

[13:23:30] <plank> hahahaha
[13:23:33] <arryana> i think they're music for musicians
[13:23:35] <plank> maybe not for you
[13:23:37] <plank> yeah
[13:23:42] <arryana> it's over my head
[13:23:51] <plank> great stuff, very potent
[13:23:59] <arryana> i can see why someone who understands them would like it
[13:24:08] <plank> im not sure i "understand" them
[13:24:13] <plank> but i certainly appreciate them
[13:24:19] <plank> fripp is a freaking weirdo man
[13:24:20] <arryana> my other half was rapt, and it was really sweet to watch
[13:24:29] <plank> have you heard magma?
[13:24:31] <arryana> we saw robert plant around the same time
[13:24:32] <arryana> nope
[13:24:44] <plank> the other half thinking it was sweet reminds me of that show
[13:24:53] <arryana> i'm more of a portugal the man fan

[20:38:49] <pussipupu> They're very common here, though that was the most photogenic of the day
[20:39:26] <audrey> I don't know the names of any of the mushrooms in English
[20:39:47] <audrey> hmm, "toadstool" is apparently the one I am thinking of that's toxic
[20:40:02] <pussipupu> I'm looking them up based on the Latin and Finnish :p

[20:41:34] <pussipupu> "toadstool" is generally used for any toxic mushrooms
[20:42:06] <pussipupu> Though toxicity is relative and often treatable, there's a few we eat that you have to boil repeatedly and throw away the water
