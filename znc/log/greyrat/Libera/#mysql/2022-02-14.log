[17:18:35] <tribo> where I can find windows odbc driver for mariadb ... I founded only source code
[17:21:25] <tribo> okay, I will use mysql odbc driver for mariadb
[17:21:35] <thumbs> they will work for both

[17:22:44] <thumbs> I wonder what differs with the MariaDB specific connector
[17:23:18] <thumbs> anyhow, you didn't google very well, it seems
[17:24:29] <tribo> Naktibalda: thank you, strange, I found with google only this: https://mariadb.org/download/?t=connector&p=connector-c&r=3.1.13&os=source

[21:52:52] <lsrtl__> Is there such thing as LTS release ? What is the mainstream version ?
[21:53:15] *** Joins: Sayona (~Sayona@user/sayona)
[21:56:30] <lsrtl__> It looks there is no alternative to 8.0 ?
[21:58:32] <Xgc> lsrtl__: The two major alternatives to each other are MySQL 8.0 and MariaDB 10.6.
[21:59:19] <Xgc> lsrtl__: They are not drop-in compatible with each other.  MariaDB is based on forks of MySQL and has since diverged.
[21:59:50] <Xgc> lsrtl__: What kind of alternative are you looking for?
[22:00:14] <lsrtl__> the way to go version of mysql
[22:00:53] <Xgc> lsrtl__: Since each has differing features / support, it depends more on your specific requirements.
[22:01:38] <lsrtl__> must - partitioning, monitoring, replication
[22:03:33] <Xgc> lsrtl__: You've found one channel, #mysql.  There's also #maria ..  Also, each has their own web site and documentation.
[22:03:45] <lsrtl__> Ic
[22:04:18] <lsrtl__> there is 8.0 and minor versions. Planning upgrade from 5.x to 8
[22:05:21] <lsrtl__> Is there any major difference in minor version. What minor version to pick ? Or just the last one ?!
[22:14:22] *** Joins: funhouse (~funhouse@user/funhouse)
[22:14:30] <Xgc> lsrtl__: There's no perfect answer.  For production, in most cases, when the choice is open, you'll probably want the most recent GA version which best meets your needs.
[22:14:44] <Xgc> lsrtl__: But, for you, that could mean, "don't do anything today".
[22:17:27] <Xgc> lsrtl__: It might help to understand the release naming convention used: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/which-version.html
[22:20:09] <lsrtl__> thx
[22:22:21] <lsrtl__> Is it possible to take a not full back up, say 10 % of db size ?

[23:03:00] <lsrtl_> is it possible in community edition?
[23:05:41] <_SjG_> I've got a Dev server/database and a Stage server/database, both running MySQL 8.0.28. On my Dev database, a bad query throws a foreign key error (e.g., "update foo set parent=-1 where ..."). On the Stage database, the query completes. I'm checking configs, and both databases have "foreign_key_checks	 ON" and both use InnoDB. What setting should I be looking for to make Stage as strict as Dev?
[23:09:03] <_SjG_> output from "SELECT @@GLOBAL.sql_mode;" is identical on both
[23:12:33] <_SjG_> OK. Nevermind. You can ignore me. I'm an idiot. The table somehow was created as MyISAM on Stage.
