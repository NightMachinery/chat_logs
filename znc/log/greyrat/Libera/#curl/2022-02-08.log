[15:37:12] <TomyWork> I'm trying to verify my https setup with curl. I have "curl --noproxy '*' -vvvv --cacert server.crt https://server.fqdn:8443/". the certificate presented by the server (according to openssl s_client) is checksum-identical to server.crt. server.crt is in PEM format Furthermore, the cert has subject alternate name set to server.fqdn and it has "TLS Web Server Authentication" in the extended usage field. key usage is 
[15:37:12] <TomyWork> "Digital Signature, Key Encipherment". The error I'm getting is "SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate". Here's the entire output: https://gist.github.com/TomyLobo/700060fde77862a0c9ab8d28c1dd16da
[15:39:25] <bagder> that's usually shown when the intermediate cert isn't provided by the server
[15:39:47] <TomyWork> even though I'm specifying the server's own cert as --cacert?
[15:39:48] <bagder> https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ will tell you if that's the case
[15:39:57] <bagder> yes
[15:39:59] <TomyWork> there shouldn't be any intermediate between that and itself
[15:40:08] <bagder> then that's not the problem
[15:40:10] <TomyWork> i can't use that, since it's an internal server
[15:41:17] <icing> TomyWork: use https://trustme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ and have your own CA
[15:42:00] *** Joins: otisolsen70 (~otisolsen@xd4ed80b5.cust.hiper.dk)
[15:42:12] <TomyWork> there is a CA. that CA signed the cert. I dont have its cert available to me right now.
[15:42:13] <renihs> also try using the full path to the cacert
[15:42:23] <TomyWork> already tried
[15:42:57] <icing> you need to give curl the certificate of the CA, not the certificate of the server, I belive.
[15:42:57] <renihs> ? you dont have the CA? 
[15:43:04] <renihs> yo need the CA
[15:43:11] <renihs> not the server certificate :)
[15:43:39] <renihs> --cacert server.crt <--- this needs to be the CA
[15:43:53] <icing> there are some *SSL libraries that also accept the server cert as root, but others do not.
[15:44:06] <renihs> ?
[15:44:13] <TomyWork> renihs, afaik it can be any point of the chain
[15:44:17] <renihs> how would that ever make sense
[15:44:24] <renihs> the certfiicate checks itself?
[15:44:29] <TomyWork> of course
[15:44:41] <renihs> and how does it do that? :)
[15:44:48] <TomyWork> well no, not literally
[15:44:49] *** Joins: Jaxx (~Jaxx@user/jaxx)
[15:44:51] <icing> the ca file you give curl is a list of "trust anchors" - from where to start trust
[15:44:52] <renihs> yeah, i am me, i already knew that 
[15:45:12] <TomyWork> yes and if i trust the server's cert directly, that should be enough, right?
[15:45:21] <renihs> no
[15:45:33] <renihs> or do you mean it is its own ca?
[15:45:39] <renihs> there is only one cert 
[15:45:43] <TomyWork> it's not self-signed, no
[15:45:47] <icing> as I said: it depends. it does not work with every *SSL lib, some only look for trust "upwards" from the server ca
[15:46:03] <renihs> well, if its been signed by a CA and its not the CA itself -> it needs the CA 
[15:46:05] <renihs> to verify
[15:46:08] <renihs> (or intermediate)
[15:46:30] <renihs> hmm never seen any such ssl lib but then again, dont touch many of them 
[15:46:37] <renihs> just openssl/libressl i suppose 
[15:47:02] <renihs> but in my understanding, it would need the CA/intermediate to verify the server.crt 
[15:47:07] <TomyWork> "(or intermediate)" - so if it only had an intermediate cert but not the root CA, it would work, is what you're saying?
[15:47:37] <renihs> well, the server would give out the server.crt + intermediate 
[15:47:40] <renihs> you still need the CA 
[15:47:49] <renihs> to be able to verify the chain
[15:48:05] <renihs> in my understanding/experience 
[15:48:43] <TomyWork> ok that makes more sense than what the thing you said before sounded like :)
[15:49:02] <renihs> ah, yes, the latter is what i ment 
[15:50:01] <renihs> i am currently going a bit nuts because i fail to provide a user-agent to curl from a variable in a bash script it seems ... is there any proper way todo that? am i having a quoting issue? curl -A "$UA" doesnt work for me 
[15:51:27] <icing> renihs: > set -x; N="A     B"; echo $N "$N"
[15:52:05] <TomyWork> can you send the full script, or at least what UA is being set to?
[15:52:45] <renihs> USER_AGENT="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/98.0.4758.82 Safari/537.36" 
[15:53:13] <renihs> my current attempt ... curl -s --user-agent "$USER_AGENT" -L ${URL_TARGET} -o ${COMPONENT}
[15:53:13] <TomyWork> ok the manpage for -A is weird. it says to surround the string with single quote marks to encode blanks. is that inside the parameter or are they talking about the shell?
[15:53:39] <renihs> yeah, i think i had thisissue once and solved it with some odd quoting 
[15:53:49] <renihs> but cant remember and there may be a much saner way i am failing to find
[15:54:02] <TomyWork> try USER_AGENT='<whatever you had before>'
[15:54:11] <TomyWork> if that doesn't work, try USER_AGENT='"<whatever you had before>"'
[15:54:20] <renihs> if i hardcode it with 'Mozilla/5.0 .. ' -> it works
[15:54:21] <TomyWork> single quotes are a bit less finicky
[15:54:31] <renihs> but with single quotes i cant use a variable in a shell 
[15:54:51] <TomyWork> 'blahblah'"$variable"'blahblah'
[15:54:55] <icing> hint: if you do 'set -x' you see what exactly the bash calls curl with
[15:55:06] <TomyWork> yup
[15:55:07] <renihs> yeah, it uses single quotes according to that
[15:55:24] <renihs> but it doesnt work, cloudflare refuses :)
[15:57:07] <renihs> ah, well, will dig into that, just drove me a little bit crazy already so far
[15:58:25] <renihs> but according to set -x it does: curl -s -A 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/98.0.4758.82 Safari/537.36' ... 
[15:58:29] <TomyWork> "<!-- a padding to disable MSIE and Chrome friendly error page -->" haha
[15:58:36] <renihs> which doesnt work but if i use the same line hardcoded -> it works 
[15:58:36] <TomyWork> ok the user agent works for me
[15:58:48] <TomyWork> USER_AGENT="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/98.0.4758.82 Safari/537.36"; curl --noproxy '*' -v http://myserver -A "$USER_AGENT" | head -n 20
[15:59:14] <TomyWork> can you send your whole script?
[15:59:21] <TomyWork> maybe something else is wrong
[16:00:05] <renihs> i am not doing anything else there except constructing the url hmm 
[16:00:29] <TomyWork> the url needs quotes btw
[16:00:36] <TomyWork> as does the component
[16:00:47] <renihs> yeah, i tried with and without hmm but yeah, will add again
[16:00:53] <renihs> ah component hmm 
[16:00:58] <TomyWork> always quote your expansions
[16:00:59] <renihs> never did them there maybe thats the cause
[16:01:02] <renihs> yeah
[16:01:24] <TomyWork> very helpful rule, especially if you're new and have no idea wtf an "expansion" is :D
[16:03:03] <renihs> hmm ah i just realised it seems cloudflare currently blocks me too ... or getting 500 now hmm ... ah well, i think this is a mix of problems
[16:03:21] <TomyWork> well with -v you should still see the user agent that curl is using
[16:03:29] <renihs> thanks already, will dig into that again
[16:03:36] <renihs> yeah, switched to -v
[16:04:20] <TomyWork> and I will try and get the CA cert :)
[16:04:59] <renihs> sound plan
[16:05:17] <renihs> what is odd, the line that set -x prints works just fine on the CLI 
[16:05:34] <renihs> i am starting to think that the remote side knows when its running in a script or cli ... or something :)
[16:05:45] <TomyWork> what shell are you using?
[16:05:53] <TomyWork> in your script and on your prompt
[16:06:47] <renihs> simple bash, same as cli, same system, same outgoing ip etc .. :)
[16:07:09] <TomyWork> odd
[16:07:19] <TomyWork> and it's not just that it fails randomly?
[16:07:21] <renihs> just a pipeline to download some sources and build an rpm ... and i fail at step 1 for this target ...
[16:07:34] <renihs> dunno, will give it another 15min before trying again
[16:07:42] <TomyWork> cause set -x should print properly quoted/escaped commands
[16:07:42] <renihs> it seems to work reliably on the shell 
[16:07:48] <TomyWork> so it should behave the same
[16:07:53] <renihs> i would expect so 
[16:08:14] <TomyWork> compare -v output between script and cli
[16:08:34] <TomyWork> there is something fishy going on and that will probably tell you
[16:12:30] <TomyWork> hah, got the cert chain from some other server
[16:16:07] <TomyWork> and it's working \o/
[16:35:35] <renihs> grats :)
