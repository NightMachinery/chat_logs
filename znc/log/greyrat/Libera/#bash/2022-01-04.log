[00:01:41] <MrCollinsGA> can I tell cron to do the opposite, rsync when there is a new file made in the directory? does rsync work in 'reverse'? I have read the man, maybe I am overlooking something :)
[00:01:58] <greycat> there's an #rsync channel
[00:02:06] <MrCollinsGA> there is? OK! ;) sorry thank you

[01:00:14] <greycat> The issue isn't really whether -o is a "short-circuit operator" or not.  The issue is that test or [ is a regular command, and has arguments.  All of the arguments have to be constructed and passed to it, before test does anything at all.

[04:31:44] <ash_worksi> so do anchors not work with wildcard patterns in the subsitution expansion?
[04:31:45] <mknod> ash_worksi, ${var/%\/*/dir} is actually ${var/search/replace}
[04:31:47] <tirnanog> it's because the pattern matches that which is being replaced, either way. there's no intrinsic concept of a shortest matching pattern in the case of pattern substitution. one cannot take the documented behaviour of one form of parameter expansion and simply expect it to apply, wholly, to another.
[04:33:05] <mknod> \/* matches at the end of "/path/to/file.ext"
[04:33:22] *** Joins: djph (~dpurgert@cpe-107-10-235-152.neo.res.rr.com)
[04:33:35] <tirnanog> specifically, "remove matching prefix pattern", "remove matching suffix pattern" and "pattern substitution" are different things. you are using pattern substitution at present, and it has its own documentation.
[04:33:39] <mknod> And the whole string gets replaced by "dir".
[04:33:39] <greycat> it matches the entire string

[04:41:43] <ash_worksi> yes, I just need to get drill into my head that in subsitution, * matches are greedy... it's effectively like what ## and %% do (ironically)
[04:42:29] <tirnanog> you're basically doing the same thing as sed 's|/.*$||'
[04:42:45] <tirnanog> rather, 's|/.*$|dir|'
[04:42:56] <greycat> if you want a non-greedy "trim /* and replace with xyz", just do a traditional parameter expansion and then append xyz.  ${var%/*}xyz
[04:42:58] <mknod> ash_worksi, \/ anchors your pattern at the beginning of your string.

[06:07:57] <greybot> Not a #bash question. We're no experts in that software or OS; consider asking the channel or mailing list with experts on that topic (eg. #linux #openssh #ubuntu #zsh #systemd ##kernel or PM alis with "list keyword" to search for channels).

[06:09:27] <greycat> You're probably asking the wrong question.  You want a picture of desktop 2 without introducing a new window in which to run a "scrot" type command?  Consider binding it to a key combo so it's invisible.

[09:26:17] <Celmor[m]> I'm trying to get the behavior of sed's references (\1) without having to loop
[09:26:24] <e36freak> use a temp array
[09:26:36] <e36freak> bash is just looping internally for your PE, though

[09:26:41] <e36freak> *something* has to loop
[09:26:43] <Celmor[m]> so multiple assignments is the only solution?
[09:26:47] <e36freak> yes

[09:28:45] <e36freak> to be fair, it's a shell, not a full-fledged general purpose programming language
[09:28:55] <e36freak> there's nothing wrong with looping in any language though
[09:28:58] <Celmor[m]> I've already gotten my bashrc littered with those temporary foo bar assignments and by now forgotten what each of them do
[09:29:00] <tirnanog> pattern substitutions do not entail the use of a regular expression engine in any shape or form.
[09:29:26] <Celmor[m]> the issue isn't looping itself, as you've said it does that internally anyway. the issue is the syntax
[09:29:42] <Celmor[m]> making readability harder

[09:36:13] <tirnanog> not sure that makes it any more readable, really.
[09:36:58] <tirnanog> still, it's then two variables and that's as good as it's going to get by that metric, I believe.
[09:38:35] <e36freak> tmp=("${f[@]#"$HOME"}); blah "${tmp[@]/%/**}" # or whatever
[09:38:42] <Celmor[m]> yeah, that's what I was figuring

[09:40:13] <tirnanog> "${tmp[@]/%/\/**}", potentially, but yep, I can't beat that.
[09:41:09] <tirnanog> well no, actually. because now it's missing --include=.
[09:41:55] <e36freak> might need another step then, honestly wasn't paying a ton of attention to the original problem
[09:42:16] <e36freak> might be worth benchmarking if it's faster to do a bunch of whole array modifications or just to do an explicit loop then
[09:42:32] <e36freak> at least if you're doing a bunch of it or if it's a large array
[09:44:05] <tirnanog> I think all the solutions presented have been reasonable ones but, if the intent was to gripe about not having some equivalent of sed 's///', nothing's going to be satisfactory.
[09:46:05] <Celmor[m]> I've found a preferable solution using an alternative shell
[09:46:20] <tirnanog> that being said, here's one more.
[09:46:53] <Celmor[m]> using this line: `$ar -replace "$HOME/(.*)",'--include=$1/**'`
[09:47:02] <tirnanog> # f=(/home/celmor/{foo,bar,baz}); tmp=("${f[@]/#\/home\/celmor\//--include=}"); tmp=("${tmp[@]/%/\/**}"); declare -p tmp
[09:47:03] <shbot> tirnanog: declare -a tmp=([0]="--include=foo/**" [1]="--include=bar/**" [2]="--include=baz/**")
[09:47:14] <e36freak> re='/home/celmor/(.*)'; for i in "${!f[@]}"; do [[ ${f[i]} =~ $re ]] && f[i]=--include=${BASH_REMATCH[1]}/**; done
[09:47:31] <e36freak> there you go, regex
[09:47:43] <tirnanog> and there you go, one temporary variable. any more artificial constraints? :)
[09:48:58] <Celmor[m]> wasn't about limiting the variables per se but making it readable. the thing about variables was because I already have enough snippets using foo bar baz etc. and by now I've forgotten about what each does
[09:49:20] <llua> maybe use more descriptive variable names then?
[09:49:29] <e36freak> llua: heresy
[09:49:39] <e36freak> one letter variable names for life
[09:49:58] <Celmor[m]> who'd be able to name all those
[09:50:09] <llua> a programmer
[09:50:12] <e36freak> lol
[09:50:12] <tirnanog> well, there's nothing stopping you from using rsync --include-from=<(printf '%s\n' "${f[@]}" | sed ...). maybe that would be more up your street.
[09:50:16] <llua> clearly you aren't one
[09:50:56] <Celmor[m]> don't remind me of my java programming days and all those variable names I've learnt to hate

[09:56:37] <e36freak> yeah, that's fine too

[09:57:05] <e36freak> unless you're doing arr=("${arr[@]/pe}") a few times
[09:57:05] <Celmor[m]> I... dont?
[09:58:07] <tirnanog> ah, true. not the most efficient way, but workable in this case.
[09:58:27] <Celmor[m]> that's all I needed: f=(...); f=( "${f[@]/#"$HOME"/--include=}" ); rclone copy "${f[@]/%/\/**}" ...

[17:00:07] <Blondie101010> alt works in any terminal client I've seen

[17:00:46] <djph> meh, vi bindings >>>>> emacs
[17:00:47] <Blondie101010> if true, file a bug report to Apple
[17:01:04] <geirha> Nah, pretty sure they've done it on purpose
[17:01:24] <Blondie101010> geirha:  there are various ways to change that behaviour though
[17:01:36] <Blondie101010> maybe it was remapped...  can you ctrl-arrow ?
[17:02:01] <Blondie101010> that's a common config
[17:02:22] <geirha> couldn't find any sane way to do it, so I just install iterm2 which allows configuring left option (alt) and right option (alt) separately
[17:02:49] <Blondie101010> ok so you got a solution
[17:03:36] <geirha> was just to point out there are terminals out there that don't have a meta key mapping by default
[17:04:06] <Blondie101010> they may mess up the keymaps, but don't control such thing as meta

[17:04:56] <geirha> ESC still works of course, but alt works as alt+gr
[17:04:57] *** Joins: wwallace (~afernande@63.240.73.102)
[17:05:19] <Blondie101010> if the same shell config works on iterm2, then it tells you that your key mappings on the other terminal don't fit your environment
[17:05:34] <geirha> obviously
[17:06:06] <earnest> (And alt+gr is usually represented as ctrl+alt)
[17:06:07] <Blondie101010> that's really where it ends, especially when you end up using a program that's renown to be 1000 times better
[17:06:09] <geirha> so you have to choose between both alts being Meta or both alts being "alt+gr"
[17:06:27] <Blondie101010> ugh
[17:06:33] <Blondie101010> that's abnormal
[17:06:50] <geirha> It's apple. They know what's best for you. Don't question it
[17:07:01] <earnest> Almost no good software is made by teams of people, only ever single developers
[17:07:39] <earnest> (A single developer probably also helps limit the scope by dint of them only being one person)
[17:07:58] <Soliton> do you have any examples?
[17:08:20] <earnest> Almost every cli tool that I use, various graphical menus, etc.
[17:09:36] <Soliton> do you have any examples that people other than yourself know about?
[17:10:48] <earnest> vi, vim, bash, tmux, ksh, bemenu, filespec, xterm, qutebrowser, virtually all of unix userland, etc.
[17:12:24] <Soliton> oh so single developer means a single person maybe has read all the current code?
[17:12:27] <earnest> Almost any window manager, dtach, dvtm, pretty much everything suckless made, dxvk, basu, vmtouch, mitogen, sioyek, elfexec, etc.
[17:13:28] <Soliton> and bash is a counter example i guess.

[18:23:25] <stevenm_> Soliton, yeah that's the only way I can think it would be possible
[18:24:01] <stevenm_> was hoping for a way of directly referencing the array itself (rather than the number of items, the items themselves, or the first item)
[18:24:37] <stevenm_> i.e. for bash to know arr1 is an array and arr2 is an array - and however bash stores the data for them... if that data was directly compared then they would not be equal
[18:24:51] <stevenm_> presumably no way to do that?
[18:25:00] <Soliton> that sounds pointless.
[18:25:21] <Soliton> they are two different arrays so they'll never be the same.

[22:47:08] <idlus> hi, something hard to search the web for, are the expressions $'\xHEX' posix or specific to bash/zsh?
[22:47:31] <llua> soon to be posix, where soon may be 5 to 10 years
[22:47:50] <geirha> Hm. will \x become POSIX too then?
[22:47:56] <idlus> argh, not portable then?
[22:48:06] <geirha> not yet, anyway
[22:48:20] <idlus> ok thanks
[22:48:30] <earnest> idlus: only octal
[22:48:49] <idlus> earnest: as in?
[22:49:09] <earnest> idlus: octal, as compared to hexadecimal
[22:49:30] <geirha> printf '\033' is posix, while printf '\x1b' is not
[22:49:51] <idlus> I see, thanks earnest and geirha
[22:50:08] <geirha> would be nice if \xNN is included with the addition of $'...' to POSIX
