[03:40:14] <tag> I have been living under a rock and I had no idea the linux permission system had gotten so fucking complex while I wasn't looking.
[03:40:36] <tag> Goodness
[03:42:29] <Torr> tag: What's up?
[03:43:11] <tag> Just trying to create a mental map of this very intricate system that is cgroups1, cgroups2, capabilities and namespaces.
[03:43:56] <Torr> Ohhh, these permissions.
[03:44:01] <Torr> Yeah
[03:44:57] <tag> I miss the days when there was just uid 0 and everything else.
[03:46:06] <Torr> From 1 point of attack to many :D

[03:48:59] <Torr> tag: Why are u on Linux?
[03:49:51] <tag> What should I use instead?
[03:50:33] <Torr> If your hardware supports it, u could try OpenBSD.
[03:51:27] <tag> If my production environment wasn't Linux, that would seem like a good plan.
[03:52:32] <tag> I'm basically married to Linux at this point
[03:52:46] <tag> My production environments all have a ton of containers and shit
[03:53:12] <yeti> LLIS - linux locked in syndrome
[03:53:23] <yeti> linux IS the new windows
[03:53:55] <tag> Yes, it is

[03:55:56] <yeti> a package format for all systems will come
[03:56:12] <yeti> I suspect it being part of the systemd coup
[03:56:53] <yeti> they do to the nix digitope what they did to our fields
[03:56:58] <yeti> monoculture
[03:57:06] <yeti> and we know it will be bad
[03:57:23] <tag> We're in a fucked up fragmo-culture
[03:57:35] <tag> because in practice, most Software Engineers actually run OS-X
[03:57:51] <tag> ...and they don't know linux at all, and barely know what a unix is
[03:58:03] <yeti> slaves
[03:58:06] <tag> and they tell *me* containerization is important
[03:58:29] <tag> And then they write software in Java and deploy it in a container

[04:03:22] <tag> I mean we really are pretty much there, I have these processes running on my workstation which take like 40gb of ram like that's somehow okay for what's barely more sophisticated than an IRC client (discord)
[04:04:16] <yeti> we already hit the complexity wall but the sound of that bang still hasnt reached most
[04:04:29] <tag> cgroups are cute but when I look at my cgroup tree ... it's a zoo. Firefox is off in its own cgroup, but my window manager and half a dozen snap apps all for some reason share one.
[04:04:43] <tag> still firefox seems to be able to bring my computer to a crawl
[04:05:27] <yeti> IT needs a reboot
[04:05:33] <Torr> tag: Have a look at Seamonkey, they forked Firefox a long time ago.
[04:05:50] <tag> Did they avoid all the anti-tracking bullshit?
[04:05:51] <Torr> It's an independent project nowadays.
[04:06:11] <Torr> tag: Yeah
[04:06:45] <tag> Looks like the old Mozilla Suite
[04:06:53] <tag> Oh, I remember this project it is the old Mozilla suite
[04:07:11] <yeti> the old netscape-all-in-one
[04:07:24] <Torr> They forked before the whole Proton and whatnot UI came about.
[04:07:46] <tag> well, mozilla wasn't netscape (like at all, it was what happened when netscape tried to rewrite from scratch and committed suicide while simultaneously getting murdered by Microsoft)
[04:08:21] <yeti> I'm not happy with someone having my mail and surfing the web...

[04:08:52] <yeti> one "app"
[04:09:36] <tag> I used to use it, hell I even used to use chatzilla
[04:10:05] <tag> Then for a long time after I switched to Phoenix (and then later Firefox) I ran chatzilla standalone using xulrunner
[04:10:39] <yeti> why should i chat in a GUI?
[04:11:44] <tag> I thought it was nicer to look at, had more layout options.
[04:12:00] <yeti> thats why I prefer terminals
[04:12:16] <tag> Because they have fewer layout options?
[04:12:17] <yeti> otherwise I'd play too much with styles, looks, ...
[04:12:37] <tag> ah yeah for sure...esp chatzilla just used CSS for styling.
[04:12:46] <tag> you could do all kinds of funny business with it
[04:12:59] <yeti> and being able to run my stuff over mosh is more important to me
