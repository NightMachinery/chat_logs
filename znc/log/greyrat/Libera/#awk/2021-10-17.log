[15:42:18] <TRS> Morning, I have a text logfile. The log file is filled with occurances of an event which ends with a line that has [END] like so   [2021-10-17 08:06:31] [END]    I want to display the most recent occurance in the log file. So I believe I'm looking to output from the logfile starting at the bottom of the file all the text in between the first and second instances of [  [2021-10-17 08:06:31] [END]
[15:43:52] <TRS> I need a lot of help, sorry, I'm not sure where to being to pull out that result. 
[15:44:01] <TRS> Can anyone give it a try?
[16:11:59] <TRS> sed -n -e 's/^.*[END]: //p' | tac -r /var/log/ipfiltering.log
[16:12:04] <TRS> I'm not sure
[16:12:08] <TRS> I'm trying to use awk
[16:12:21] <TRS> but i can only find example for sed
[16:27:14] <emanuele6> since the dates are lexicographically sortable, it should not be too hard  
[16:29:12] <emanuele6> TRS: http://paste.wooledge.org/9561
[16:29:15] <emanuele6> something like that
[16:32:51] <TRS> Very nice
[16:32:57] <TRS> Thank you. text ing now
[16:33:58] <TRS> testing
[16:34:46] <TRS> to input a files contents int othis function I would put  <<  after that last }   ?
[16:35:41] <emanuele6> i don't understand
[16:36:09] <TRS> OR would I feed input like so...tac -r /var/log/ipfiltering.log
[16:37:12] <TRS> https://pastebin.com/WJV7TMpZ
[16:37:15] <TRS> like this?
[16:37:31] <emanuele6> that is not valid
[16:37:38] <emanuele6> you need to close the quote
[16:37:52] <emanuele6> ' > output.txt
[16:39:49] <emanuele6> and you can use `awk', you don't need to use `nawk' explicitly like i was doing (i was only doing it to make sure i wasn't using some gawkisms)
[16:39:58] <TRS> ok
[16:40:05] <TRS> just about ready to run it
[16:41:16] <TRS> no result
[16:41:29] <TRS> output.txt was empty
[16:42:13] <TRS> https://pastebin.com/mUJW4rJG
[16:42:16] <TRS> this is the script
[16:42:49] <emanuele6> i gave you an example input to show it works
[16:43:03] <emanuele6> if it doesn't work, it means that the input is not actually as you described it
[16:43:22] <TRS> oh....I can share a sample. 
[16:44:45] <TRS> https://pastebin.com/weDivp5w
[16:44:53] <TRS> it's burn after read too
[16:46:05] <TRS> i want to output all text in the file between the final two instances of [END] 
[16:47:34] <emanuele6> :|
[16:47:43] <emanuele6> that is not even close to what you described
[16:47:55] <TRS> did the log same show? oh opps sorry about that
[16:52:23] <TRS> I tired to explain it
[16:52:32] <TRS> sorry I didn't do a good job. 
[16:59:02] <TRS> emanuele6: Would you be willing to try and help me yet again?
[17:07:42] <emanuele6> mmm, let's see
[17:10:29] <emanuele6> huh? why are you using tac -r?
[17:12:17] <TRS> to start at the bottom of the file
[17:12:23] <TRS> should be just tac
[17:12:31] <TRS> maybe?
[17:13:42] <emanuele6> yes, i am not sure what your tac -r does
[17:13:50] <TRS> some regex thing
[17:13:56] <TRS> idk why i put it there
[17:13:57] <emanuele6> in GNU tac, -r means to use regex as delimiter
[17:14:06] <emanuele6> but if you don't put it i don't know what it means
[17:14:31] <emanuele6> i think it only matters if you pass -s
[17:15:18] <TRS> yup, it's not needed, I agree

[17:20:00] *** Quits: kensanata (~user@user/kensanata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:23:16] <emanuele6> but why are you even using tac?
[17:24:57] <emanuele6> TRS: also as far as i can tell my original script straight up works anyway even though it could be much simpler with that format
[17:25:18] <emanuele6> i think you are just messing it up because you decided to revert the input for some reason
[17:26:43] <emanuele6> s/revert/reverse/
[17:27:43] <TRS> B/c i wanted the result at the bottom most of the input file. 
[17:27:56] <TRS> the latest occurance
[17:28:30] <emanuele6> but if you reverse the file, the [END] tag is at the top of the section, not at the bottom of the section, no?
[17:29:25] <emanuele6> > the latest occurance < so you don't even need to sort them
[17:29:42] *** Quits: lavaball (felix@31.204.155.215) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:30:04] <geirha> tac file | awk '$NF == "[END]" { ++n } n {print} n == 2 {exit}' | tac
[17:30:40] <emanuele6> exactly ^
[17:31:20] <TRS> I removed the tac -r and used just cat
[17:31:23] <TRS> andnow it works great
[17:31:44] <TRS> https://pastebin.com/srWE63YG
[17:31:58] <emanuele6> but that is overkill
[17:32:29] <emanuele6> 1. because you have the date in every line, not just on the [END] line; 2. because the dates are sorted in the file
[17:32:31] <TRS> tac input_file | awk '$NF == "[END]" { ++n } n {print} n == 2 {exit}' | tac > output_file 
[17:32:37] <TRS> is that correct?
[17:32:38] <emanuele6> you can simply use what geirha said
[17:34:09] <TRS> works
