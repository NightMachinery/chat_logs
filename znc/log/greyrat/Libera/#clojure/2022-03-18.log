[00:54:24] <Xylon> Hi all. I've done a thing which works but I'm wondering if it's bad practice. Is it OK to use % inside a function inside an anonymous function. e.g. (apply #(str (str "foo" %)) ["bar"])
[00:56:46] <Para> How else would you get the param there :)
[00:57:31] <Para> So no, doesn't matter.
[00:58:34] <Xylon> OK cool. Doing some problems from book "Clojure for the Brave and True" -- very good book
[01:01:23] <seebs> hmm
[01:01:50] <seebs> so if you're nesting functions, you probably have to actually use the (fn) form or use explicit (let ...) at some point to let you see both sets of arguments.
[01:04:38] <Xylon> hm I put my code on pastebin for context. challenge is to make a function that can convert the list of body parts into an animal with an arbritrary number of arms, legs etc https://pastebin.com/6hNhXKjg
[01:04:56] <Xylon> my code works I'm just trying to figure out if it's the most efficient or correct
[01:05:49] <Xylon> some of the functions and variable are strangely named I'll admit

[01:13:19] <Para> seebs: yeah, can't nest #()
[01:14:52] <seebs> can't, or it's just a bad idea? :P
[01:15:17] <seebs> oh, not allowed.
[01:15:27] <seebs> that's fair i guess
[01:15:41] <seebs> probably saner than what would happen if they were allowed

[01:19:20] <Para> Xylon: a few quick thoughts: {} is the map shorthand, so calling `hash-map` specifically is somewhat redundant. Clojure allows the use of commas, but they're interpreted as whitespace and carry no syntactic meaning, so one doesn't usually see them. Logically calling a vector entry `tail` probably is just a refactoring thing you didn't change yet? :) There's also clojure.string/starts-with? which
[01:19:21] <Para> allows you to avoid the regex. Calling `def` inside another def_ is considered a smell, use something like `let` instead.
[01:19:25] *** Joins: wyrd (~wyrd@gateway/tor-sasl/wyrd)
[01:19:38] <Para> That's the nits of it. Structurally looks good IMO.
[01:19:53] <Para> (I can't quite remember what the exercise was about, something about injured hobbits?)
[01:20:53] <Xylon> this was a follow-up task about refactoring it to apply to space-aliens with arbritrary amount of limbs. but I re-implemented it without looking at the original solution
[01:22:27] <Xylon> for your point about not needing hash-map: it is actually using % inside to apply an argument so not sure how to eliminate that
[01:24:12] <Xylon> thanks for the point about the let. I wasn't sure about that
[01:26:43] <Para> fair enough :)
[01:27:01] <seebs> when i get some time and make more progress on my thing i should upload it somewhere and ask for review comments
[01:27:04] <Para> There's no one-line replacement and it's almost midnight here so I think I should go to sleep instead of trying to muster an alternative.
[01:27:59] <seebs> [checks timezones] stay safe out there
[01:30:34] <Para> Finland's fine. For now.

[21:19:30] <seebs> so, for this thing that is parsing a stream, i end up with a lot of functions all of which get invoked on the same thing. and in a more object-shaped language, i'd probably make a type for this and give it methods and then i wouldn't be constantly explicitly specifying the thing it's operating on.
[21:21:02] <seebs> this doesn't seem as idiomatic in clojure, though, it looks like usually people just have the thing you pass around. also this sometimes involves something called defrecord that i haven't reached yet in any of the books/tutorials i've been reading.

[21:34:03] <seebs> and i notice the (Handle. a b c d) format, which looks like it's just providing initializers in named order, and after that, you can do (:name object) to access the fields.
[21:35:47] <seebs> which leads me to wonder: can i define functions which support the (method. object) syntax? i know it doesn't really matter, i'm just really used to namespacing things so that i don't have to worry about name overlaps. e.g., in my NBT code, i would naturally name a function load-string, but that name already exists.
