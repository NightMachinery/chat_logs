[06:34:06] <jiffe> earendel: my constructor instantiates local variables from classes defined in files that I'm now loading dynamically, I wanted the classes themselves to load the js files they require, I was just curious why the limitation, I can move this code out into a separate function but I'll likely just load these files up front at the point I know what I'll need
[06:35:34] <earendel> n>class User { constructor(name){ this.name=name ; } static async create(name) { var user=new User(name); return user; }};  User.create('blah') // seems to work
[06:35:35] <jellobot> (okay) User { name: 'blah' }
[06:36:44] <earendel> note you will have to await User.create() .. the REPL here does that automatically.

[06:42:54] *** brentaarnold_ is now known as brentaarnold
[06:43:21] <earendel> but u get the idea. u just use the async static method which calls the constructor to create bare instance.  then make modifications to it before it gets returned. usually the constructor is not even allowed to be called from outside the class (similar to internal). sometimes it's restricted to be called by other classes. like most elements in a document.
[06:43:30] *** Joins: deltab (~deltab@user/deltab)
[06:51:29] <earendel> saying that, i wonder how they implemented this feature. HTMLPreElement() is not allowed to be instanced via new HTMLPreElement(); but internally you can create instances via document.create('pre') ..
[06:51:41] <earendel> document.createElement('pre') ..it is.

[16:53:35] <Koopz> i imported that thing into my files, ran a build and after solving complications with my code using the null-coalesce operator i ended up with a 2MB .js file
[16:54:36] <Koopz> my own codebase is 60 KBs for reference
[16:54:52] <DnzAtWrk> and the amount of code you really need is like 30 KB

[16:56:00] <Koopz> i suspect the same, leading to my question: is there some general approach on how to create custom builds and import these instead?
[16:57:22] <Koopz> for example my project needs an editor that only needs to support 2 languages: Github flavoured Markdown and the custom language i create based on it, adding custom syntax highlighting
[16:57:29] *** Joins: sickdyd (~sickd@120.51.82.69.ap.gmobb-fix.jp)
[16:58:10] <DnzAtWrk> should probably just google github lightweight code editor javascript

[17:00:34] <DnzAtWrk> wow
[17:00:40] <DnzAtWrk> zero non-dev deps?
[17:00:41] <Maxdamantus> What does "support" mean? Just syntax highlighting? Or adding custom commands or something?

[17:00:58] <Maxdamantus> afair, both of those are fairly doable in Monaco, if there isn't already support for some language.

[17:02:38] <Maxdamantus> Syntax highlighting involves defining some "Monarch" object, which is just a tree of objects, can be represented as JSON, I'm sure there's already a Monarch definition for Markdown.
[17:03:21] <DnzAtWrk> I made syntax highlighting by overlapping two text areas :D
[17:03:46] <Koopz> i already have the syntax highlighting part done
[17:04:09] <Koopz> i just want to bring the bundle size down by kicking out the 72 other languages

[21:07:16] <systemfault> Not saying that as a Samsung fan, while I like their hardware... their Android customizations are a no-go for me.
[21:08:15] <banana_> i like the iphone 12 build.
[21:08:36] <banana_> but basically yeah don't care if some android specs are better etc.
[21:08:59] <systemfault> Same... but that's not my point.
[21:09:31] <systemfault> My point is that it's Apple, at least during the Jobs era, that came up with revolutionary things
[21:09:46] <systemfault> There hasn't been anything of the sort for a long time now...
[21:09:46] <banana_> yeah for sure haha. jobs was a tyrant though
[21:09:58] <systemfault> Yeah, a-holes can have good ideas.
[21:09:58] <banana_> I mean tyrants are good sometimes though and he'd be the case.
[21:10:16] <banana_> yeah they're pretty much a shell of what they were for sure.
[21:10:56] <systemfault> I still buy macbook pros... I still love their products (except the watch... but I don't watches anyway..)
[21:11:02] <banana_> but you can tell Tim Cook loved Jobs so there's something still there.
[21:11:26] <banana_> he communicates to him still in his dreams
[21:11:38] <banana_> can't say that about other CEOs
[21:12:29] <banana_> yeah Apple wouldve came up with more new stuff by now.
[21:13:33] <systemfault> *I don't wear watches anyway
[21:13:36] <systemfault> Yeah :)
[21:13:47] <banana_> yeah the iwatch idk
[21:13:53] <banana_> I call it the iwatch
[21:14:51] <banana_> tbh iphones are good because they're status symbols, not saying it's right to value that. also the blue messages is sorta one too
[21:15:41] <banana_> can't escape the status hierarchy
[21:16:15] <systemfault> Not sure I get that "status" thing... at least where I live, people get their phones with contracts
[21:16:27] <systemfault> So, most people can actually afford iPhones.
[21:17:00] <systemfault> Macbook Pros, I can understand... not everyone have $3500 to spend on a laptop
[21:17:39] <banana_> like you drive an expensive car and people think "wow that cars nice, successful people drive that you might be successfully, more interesting at the very least"

[21:19:22] <banana_> so you can status in the sense that you're at least average I guess?
[21:19:41] <banana_> yeah ok it's relative to where you live I'm sure.
[21:19:51] <systemfault> We're programmers.... unless you're from a developing/third-world country, you're way above average
[21:20:19] <banana_> status is just the relative worth to people around you based on common shared beliefs
[21:21:50] <banana_> yeah well programming pays decent not sure if it's one of those jobs where you gain status from the job itself, not like doctors or astronauts. unless you work at a name-brand company

[22:09:20] <diophantoz> hi, so i've managed to be able to remove and add a DOM element based on a "changed" radio button click.
[22:09:58] <diophantoz> unfortunately there is a layout with two options which will have the DOM element, and one that doesn't
[22:10:52] <diophantoz> so clicking on either of them it will add infinite amounts of DOM element, and only the possibility to remove one of these
[22:11:40] <diophantoz> by clicking on the one that removes one instance of the DOM element
[22:12:00] <diophantoz> (using "changed" linked to the EventListener)
[22:12:12] *** Joins: friend (friend@c-73-43-171-169.hsd1.ga.comcast.net)
[22:12:33] <diophantoz> i could use click, and remove them by clicking on that one but that doesn't change the radio button status
[22:12:48] <diophantoz> also it will eventually try to remove "nothing"
[22:13:04] <diophantoz> not sure how to approach this
[22:13:27] <diophantoz> i have not used any object orientation technique such as "this object" or similar

[22:16:31] <thykka> diophantoz, what are you building? like, what's the end-goal of removing and adding these elements?
[22:16:50] <thykka> and why radios
[22:18:17] <thykka> since you said 'unfortunately', it seems as if maybe your event listener is getting applied on a radio input, that isn't supposed to use it?

[22:26:16] <diophantoz> the layout would work with only two radio buttons
[22:26:51] <diophantoz> radio button A, DOM element is present
[22:27:10] *** Quits: TheSilentLink (~TheSilent@user/thesilentlink) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[22:27:14] <diophantoz> radio button B, the DOM element is removed, but if you press radio button A again it comes back
[22:27:31] <thykka> why not just hide or show the element then, instead of removing and re-adding?
[22:27:48] <diophantoz> i was not aware
[22:27:59] <diophantoz> i use appendChild and removeChild
[22:28:26] <diophantoz> with appendChild i use createElement to create the exact html element i have removed
[22:28:41] <thykka> you could try element.style.display = 'none'; but the better option is to make a CSS class with that rule, then use element.classList.toggle
[22:28:51] <diophantoz> reason was because i used functions and got a problem with scope

[23:10:44] <samsch> Using one of the array iterators. The most common are usually `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `forEach`. Those are all Array.prototype methods.
[23:11:04] <samsch> You'd use the appropriate iterator for the task you intend to do.

[23:24:09] <ljharb> !iterations @ rapier
[23:24:09] <jellobot> rapier, ECMAScript's Array contains a number of built-in methods for iteration (e.g., map, reduce, every, some, filter, and forEach). They relieve the need for manual iteration, provide better abstraction than a `for` loop, and make it clear what your iteration is doing. See https://gist.github.com/ljharb/58faf1cfcb4e6808f74aae4ef7944cff
[23:31:08] <rapier> thank you all of you, guys
[23:32:32] <rapier> pulse, little bit off topic, but python is C's child.
[23:32:51] <pulse> clearly a bastard child
[23:33:33] <wroathe> rapier: Javascript is also C's child.

[23:38:22] <samsch> Eh, JS's relationship to C is definitely at couple generations removed
[23:38:32] <samsch> JS is the child of smalltalk and Java... somehow.
[23:39:16] <samsch> Pretty sure those things shouldn't be compatible enough to make a mashup, but maybe that's how it's different enough from Java to actually be decent
[23:39:40] <rapier> i think js is not easy to read.
