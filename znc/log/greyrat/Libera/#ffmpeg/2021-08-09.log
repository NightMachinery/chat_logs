[00:51:55] <GuiToris> hello, I'm about to digitize old VHS videos. I think I'll use utvideo because that's what Adobe supports. (it doesn't support it natively but anyway) I was wondering if I should specify things that I've never understood like -pix_fmt yuv420p or different color profiles?

[07:33:08] <cslcm> jesus.. why doesn't the volume filter automatically detect "precision=fixed" based on the input sample format o_O
[07:33:18] <cslcm> there's 6 hours of my day gone
[07:33:36] <cslcm> i thought it was my input buffer being screwey
[07:35:06] <BtbN> Because the precision setting determines its supported input sample formats.
[07:35:13] <BtbN> http://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob;f=libavfilter/af_volume.c;h=844ddbeff73945c2b7902da2429235be52cf67fe;hb=HEAD#l137
[07:35:43] <BtbN> And usually floating point math is better for audio filtering
[07:38:45] <cslcm> but you feed into the graph by providing the sample format to the abuffer filter, right? does it not pass that information on to the rest of the graph?
[07:41:27] <cslcm> anyway, no matter.. all working now

[11:43:36] <GuiToris> thanks, I'll show you the command in a sec that I'm planning to use, hopefully it's all good
[11:43:47] <furq> you generally just set all that stuff to correspond to the entry in list_formats that you want
[11:44:58] <furq> or you can set them with v4l2-ctl

[16:25:11] <GuiToris> I mean interlacing
[16:33:27] <GuiToris> should I store the video as it is (interlaced) or should I deinterlace it?
[16:34:20] <c_14> interlacing was original for analog video/TVs
[16:34:37] <c_14> If you're reencoding, I'd deinterlace the content just to remove issues further down the line
[16:34:40] <GuiToris> I've just realized that, and I'm very very surprised
[16:35:35] <GuiToris> I checked the manual of our camcorder and it says 50 fields per second, I guess I should change the command somehow
[16:35:43] <GuiToris> right know ffmpeg thinks it's progressive
[16:36:36] <GuiToris> I guess I should change it to -framerate 50 then
[16:37:14] <c_14> you can try running the idet filter on the video first
[16:37:47] <c_14> generally the easiest way to deint is idet,yadif=1 but there's a lot of deinterlacers in ffmpeg with lots of options you can look at

[19:13:58] <another> IIRC ffv1 defaults to level 1. I'd specify -level 3 to be safe. see https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/FFV1

[19:24:55] <another> actually it seems to default to level 0
[19:25:28] <JEEB> yea but look at the logic inside init
[19:25:30] <JEEB> :P
[19:26:03] <another> IIRC it auto selects 3 if you have slices or something
[19:26:41] <JEEB>     // Unspecified level & slices, we choose version 1.2+ to ensure multithreaded decodability
[19:26:44] <JEEB>     if (avctx->slices == 0 && avctx->level < 0 && avctx->width * avctx->height > 720*576)
[19:26:47] <JEEB>         s->version = FFMAX(s->version, 2);
[19:26:48] <JEEB> and that gets bumped to 3 later in the function
[19:27:20] <JEEB> like literally right after that
[19:27:34] <another> hmm.. I just tested with `ffprobe -debug 1 foo.nut`
[19:27:38] <furq> his source is 720x576 though
[19:27:42] <JEEB> yes

[19:27:44] <JEEB> I did note that
[19:27:50] <another> reports 0 w/o `-level`
[19:29:41] <JEEB> I think the simplest is to print out s->version at the end of encode_init
[19:30:06] <JEEB> or after it starts tweaking it
[19:30:20] <another> or explicitly specify the level
[19:30:23] <JEEB> sure
[19:31:34] <JEEB> also if the auto logic no longer works for stuff larger than 720x576 that's fun :)
[19:31:51] <JEEB> since the comment clearly notes it's supposed to be setting the version upwards if it's larger than that xD
[19:32:10] <JEEB> (and internally I have this feeling of "why even keep support for the older versions if effectively you're standardizing v3)
[19:32:22] <JEEB> same for the encoder default
[19:32:35] <JEEB> since it just confuses people as far as I can see :)
[19:33:28] <another> maybe that default needs to be revisited

[22:59:24] <flp> Hey guys, I'm having a question about named complex filters and sending zmq messages. It doesn't seem to fail to send multiple parameters at once for crop@fc=w=1280:h=720:x=1280:y=0,zmq but the second parameter does not seem to have any effect. Is it possible to change multiple parameters in a single call?
[23:00:16] <flp> I've tried echo crop@fc x 1280 h 720 | zmqsend
