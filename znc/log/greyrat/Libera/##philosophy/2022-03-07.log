[00:55:45] <audrey> Whataboutism is fine. It's a charge that hypocrites use.
[00:57:41] <audrey> And anyway, wasn't it Bush Sr. who said that America sets the example and the rest of the world follows?
[00:57:54] <audrey> Seems pretty accurate.

[02:59:52] <ProfSimm> John thinks of 5 kinds of fruit. He wants to know how you'd order these fruits best to worst, so he wants to tell you the 5 fruits, but without biasing you by saying them to you in some order. You can ask questions like "do you have a fruit that's yellow" or "tennis ball sized" and John can answer yes, or no.
[02:59:58] <ProfSimm> Or when exactly one fruit matches a set of criteria you provide, he can give you the name of the fruit. In short, John can provide three answers to criteria:  "0 items match your description", "more than 1 items match your description"  or "exactly 1 item matches: pear". This would not reveal John's own order for these fruits. So... how to make this conversation efficient so all fruits are quickly discovered?

[14:00:16] <pussipupu> The law and associated sanctions certainly help
[14:01:05] <pussipupu> Picking a lock is for instance much harder to detect than physically assaulting someone but for sure there are similarities to these and many other situations
[14:02:25] <Maxdamantus> Why would someone want to pick a lock? Probably to steal property, which will be detectable anyway.

[15:12:56] <mrig> Is not 'home economic' a stutter, is there a term which describes this phenomenon? Economy's origin, as a word, is the science of managing a household, and further back than that the ocean. Where as plutonomic was considered for quite some time to be the term for the science or art of dealing with money.
[15:13:53] <mrig> so it would seem that economy and ecology are really both in their essence discussing the same thing, why then has our understanding of this become so distorted?
[15:15:53] <mrig> Could we consider the possibility that we have gradually lost linguistic resolution and nuance, due perhaps to some form of entropy?
[15:23:56] <mrig> The suffix grammar seems to be somewhat broken too.
[15:24:32] <mrig> well completely would be more accurate.
[15:28:00] <mrig> sorry for the interruption.
[15:28:39] <pussipupu> One root having two descendants with different meanings would surely be an increase in resolution not a decrease?
[15:29:09] <pussipupu> And etymology doesn't dictate meaning, so I don't understand your "distortion" question
[15:29:13] <mrig> Locks are also very fine elegant mechanical devices, a think that one comes across rarely in the everyday life of most folk; I think that there is a strong desire that is felt by many to approach such for no other than this reason.
[15:29:43] <mrig> pussipupu: if grammar is emergent, as has been demonstrated, why would this be the case?
[15:31:03] <mrig> seem to me that there would be a very strong thread of logic in etymology. Some languages are constructed with it in mind also; One could argue that ancient greek may have been amongst those. As its sister sanskrit clearly is.
[15:31:40] <mrig> that english is a joke at this level is another mater altogether, we should not let this cloud our thought about greek.
[15:31:50] <mrig> ancient greek at least.
[15:32:53] <pussipupu> We weren't talking about Greek, and I'm afraid I don't know what you're arguing overall
[15:33:41] <mrig> oh do carry on, I just had a strong urge to express a thought and thought this the best place to do so.
[15:33:47] <mrig> musing.
[15:34:38] <pussipupu> Locks look to be wonderful puzzles, in no small part because of their history as part of an arms race, I'm going to start on locksport and look forward to it greatly
[15:34:52] *** Quits: Lumine (Lumine@user/luminousnine) (Quit: bbl)
[15:35:33] <mrig> the dependence upon any such a word as economy in a society, seems logical to enquire about it, the implications of the thought that arises upon so doing, do seem to be rather ironic.
[15:36:00] <mrig> why an arms race and not a sport of keeping time?
[15:36:50] <mrig> the practice of keeping time, I mean this is critical in astrology/astronomy and would have been the center of most normal peoples thoughts and desires, rather than war and arms.
[15:37:10] <pussipupu> Because some people have been trying to open them and others have been trying to make them unopenable without the appropriate key
[15:37:58] <pussipupu> And they've evolved under these pressures
[15:38:00] <mrig> sure yes, I would think that it was others that invented them whilst pondering the stars.
[15:38:35] <pussipupu> Again I don't understand what you're saying, sorry
[15:38:38] <mrig> I think that you see pressure and competition where it does not exist.
[15:39:18] <pussipupu> It pretty clearly exists in the history of lock design
[15:39:58] <pussipupu> "locks" not "clocks", security not timekeeping
[15:40:08] <mrig> OH I am sure that it would be there to some extent, just not the only leading force is my contention.
[15:40:26] <mrig> well the mechanics are very similar.
[15:40:51] <pussipupu> Not very, no
[15:42:59] <mrig> Upon that we shall have to agree to disagree.

[15:47:07] <mrig> the skill set's required to make both mechanical locks and clocks have been around for a very long time.

[16:04:35] <mrig> The thing that I love about it, is that he is exploring making it using only the technologies that would have been available at the time, thus making sound hypothesis as to how it may have been built.
[16:05:59] <mrig> I think that the use of gears will have been a bread and butter thing for mathematicians of the era, a natural result of the math of astrology.

[22:29:16] <Ungwelian> It's pretty absurd how a lot of people in the west don't even realize that the media here uses propaganda too.
[22:31:07] <Ungwelian> Typically the perspective is throughly western.
[22:31:39] <trbp> Ungwelian: yes it does
[22:32:44] <trbp> but well, even if today with enough financial support to make that mass of fake news snipplets about the bombs and people suffering there, i doubt it is fake
[22:33:18] <Ungwelian> Even a basic "what are they thinking and why" would be great. Basic ethnographic method.
[22:33:19] <trbp> so still, yeah russia is pissed about the east nato extensions but, war? is that or was that needed?
[22:33:56] <AStolypina> NATO has been missing opportunities to de-escalate Cold War tensions since 1991.
[22:34:18] <AStolypina> Russia is responsible for the war in Ukraine, don't get me wrong. However, NATO helped set the stage.
[22:34:34] <AStolypina> It's *really frustrating* to see this being painted as "lololol Russia".
[22:34:42] <AStolypina> Mr. Bush, I have Iraq on the phone. They just have a few questions for you-
[22:34:51] <Ungwelian> I'm increasingly coming to the conclusion that reading almost any news outlet is fairly pointless.
[22:35:13] <trbp> well it is not about the one outlet
[22:35:18] <trbp> they all lie more or less
[22:35:18] <Ungwelian> Instead, I read UN Human Rights statements and human rights organizations' statements.
[22:35:31] <trbp> question is to find the news one's own taste ;)
[22:35:48] <Ungwelian> Reuters is pretty good for making a definite point of not using loaded language.
[22:35:53] <trbp> and stuff like algorithms with tiktok or youtube or facebook help with this ;)
[22:36:46] <trbp> though they are either castrated by their own what ever guidelines or some strange intervention by the goverments of some triggered countries
[22:37:41] <trbp> reuters? you mean that agency that buys news and sell it again? like a stock exchange? ;)
[22:37:56] <Ungwelian> They do?
[22:38:03] <trbp> they all do
[22:38:13] <trbp> but some more some less ;)
[22:38:46] <Ungwelian> Reuters is usually cited as a source for many news pages. And they do make a point of not using loaded language.
[22:38:58] <Ungwelian> They're also rated high for credibility.
[22:39:59] <trbp> it works more or less other way around as reuters is dependent on reporters and does not have as many they need the news of those papers ;)
[22:40:27] <trbp> and reading papers you will acknowledge there are always papers pro goverment and pro opposition
[22:40:32] <Ungwelian> https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/
[22:40:32] <ro-bot-o> [url] Reuters - Media Bias/Fact Check | mediabiasfactcheck.com
[22:40:52] <trbp> there you go you get what you buy
[22:46:11] <trbp> Ungwelian: question would now be who is mediabiasfactcheck, i mean you do not trust your own gusto to choose your kind of news source?
[22:46:35] <trbp> and they are all biased and more or less goverment conform form where they come ;)

[23:00:26] <p0indexter> my thoughts are ukraine is requesting help from the west to fight this unprovoked invasion and the west is willing to help ukraine prevail

[23:19:44] <AStolypina> Iraq and Serbia are on the phone. I think they have some questions for you.
[23:20:02] <mrig> Personally, I think that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a trouble maker and that hes is absolutely the catalyst of this situation.
[23:20:53] <mrig> Am surprised that everyone is making such a fuss over whether or not it is russia or nato/us/eu
[23:21:01] <xx> he's definitely not helping the situation, he's acting as if he was still an actor, instead of a statesman
[23:21:16] <mrig> the man is really very foolish and arrogant.
[23:21:23] <mrig> dangerous for his people.
[23:21:41] <mrig> that he become a states man is absurd.

[23:23:18] <xx> democracy is just a popularity contest, it doesn't produce the most suitable people for the positions
[23:23:22] <mrig> Really is the blind leading the blind at the moment, media is included in that.
[23:25:34] <mrig> I have heard it said of such leaders; that they would do better to write fairy stories for their people, rather than to lead them with lies, it would be far better use of their creative talents.
