[00:34:05] <sd> 06<N‚ÄãinjaStyle> how?
[00:34:11] <PublicWiFi> "ADHD body doubling is a practice in which a person with ADHD works on and completes potentially frustrating tasks alongside another person. This other person is the ‚Äúbody double‚Äù for the person with ADHD. The body double‚Äôs job is to help anchor the person with ADHD to the present moment and task, reducing the risk of distraction."
[00:34:30] <PublicWiFi> This explains why i always try to drag my wife into my home projects, mostly I just like having her around while I'm trying to focus lol

[03:45:45] <Hobadee> Why the hell do NS records take so long to propagate?
[03:46:43] <Hobadee> Using R53 to create a NS record for a subdomain.  Been well over 15 minutes and the NS records aren't propagating at all...  R53 records usually propagate in like 30 seconds
[03:52:08] <catbeard> Hobadee: NS record changes in an authoritative nameserver, or nameserver change?
[03:52:29] <signofzeta> The DNS zone should propagate, but don't forget to update them with the registrar as well
[03:52:52] <Hobadee> I created a new NS record for a subdomain
[03:52:58] <signofzeta> oh, never mind then
[03:53:59] <Hobadee> catbeard, New NS record.  Setting a new authoritative server for a subdomain
[03:54:33] <catbeard> ah subdomain NS

[03:55:47] <catbeard> rpifan: shuriuken
[03:56:06] <catbeard> signofzeta: yeah i might have guessed, CF does support subdomain NS records
[03:56:18] <catbeard> though whether you can create a zone for the subdomain is another question entirely
[03:56:36] <signofzeta> depends, do you want to host its DNS elsewhere?
[03:56:45] <catbeard> unless that's externally pointed e.g. the NS for the subdomain points to not cloudflare
[03:58:33] <Hobadee> catbeard, Not gonna share the NS, but I've done `dig NS <subdomain> @<several public DNS servers>` and it doesn't work.  If I query my R53 servers, the NS returns fine.
[03:58:46] <catbeard> can do so privately via pm if you want
[03:58:54] <signofzeta> were the TTLs extremely high?
[03:59:00] <catbeard> just need the subdomain you're trying to point the NS for
[04:00:01] <Hobadee> TTL for the NS record is just 300.  It's been over 30 minutes so far and nothing else has it yet.
[04:00:16] <signofzeta> were they set to 300 seconds before today?

[07:30:14] <Sousapro> It'll give me a chance to test out the pinecil

[07:30:43] <Hunterkll> Telgareith: and yea i didn't feel like spending $500 on those chinesium spot welder kits 
[07:30:43] <Sousapro> Still pretty cheap
[07:31:07] <Hunterkll> starter solenoid was $14.26 
[07:31:11] <Hunterkll> i already had the wire and barrier strip
[07:31:37] <Hunterkll> timer relay was $13.99.... already had the push button.... 
[07:31:49] <Hunterkll> so really I only spent like a total of $60 about, not counting the battery
[07:32:16] <Hunterkll> 12v 14ah battery... $34.50 shipped
[07:33:01] <Telgareith> mines not chinesium
[07:33:09] <Telgareith> the chinesium ones are $200 ish
[07:33:27] <Hunterkll> not for the capabilities i was looking at heh
[07:33:51] <Telgareith> I'm looking at copper
[07:33:59] <Hunterkll> but something that's basically what i built yea, $200-250 
[07:34:06] <Hunterkll> not worth it for what it does
[07:34:17] <a1> human trafficking is illegal just so you know
[07:34:30] <Telgareith> but to do it right you need a laser spot welder
[07:34:34] <Telgareith> which I do NOT have the money for
[07:34:56] <Hunterkll> i've thought about something like t his too occasionally for small stuff but

[07:36:20] <Telgareith> unless its in the past few hours
[07:36:38] <Telgareith> and oof
[07:36:45] <Telgareith> only welds 0.15mm

[07:37:39] <Hunterkll> almost all my shit's 0.1mm anyway but meh
[07:38:00] <Hunterkll> rpifan: this isn't remotely the same - this is essentially equivelent to shorting the battery out and fusing two cold pieces of metal together
[07:38:10] <Hunterkll> not making a heated soldering iron
[07:38:10] <rpifan> i actually meet a guy who works in the enterainment industry in a slightly difference branch

[11:11:23] <JollyRgrs> well, there's the technically... and then the "but really"
[11:11:38] <JollyRgrs> if you got 300MV, you prob got some amps in there
[11:11:59] <Hunterkll> just one picoamp
[11:16:48] <Hunterkll> which is like 3*(10^20) amps lol
[11:16:52] <Hunterkll> at 5 volts
[11:18:00] <sd> 12<p‚Äãyathalon> 1000amps at zero volts is ok
[11:23:17] <CoJaBo> It's the kiloamps that getya, not the megavolts.
[11:24:24] <CoJaBo> It'd be pretty hard to get significant amperage at low voltage tho lol
