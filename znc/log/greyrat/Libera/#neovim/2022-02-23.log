[00:48:01] <max397[m]> how can I change the highlight of the cursor line when I'm on a line with a sign?
[00:48:01] <max397[m]> (with the old sign api)
[00:48:54] *** mike_ is now known as milk_steak
[00:50:25] <gpanders> There is the CursorLineSign to change the highlighting of the sign column for the line you are on -- if you want to change the CursorLine highlight itself you will need to hook into the CursorMoved autocmd with something custom
[00:50:31] <gpanders> * the CursorLineSign highlight group to change
[00:51:15] <gpanders> you can use `:h sign_getplaced()` to get the signs on the current line, and if there are any change the CursorLine highlight

I opened a bug there: https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim/issues/254 but if someone with a non american/english keyboard could confirm that would be appreciated! It might be because of my configuration but so far i really cannot find another cause! Any insight much appreciated,

[05:22:03] <jaawerth> ddickstein[m]: i'd gues it either uses resolve() or the equivalent bulit-in logic, which would look at the path itself to see if it's relative after resolving symlinks. Even if you're in the directory, if you open the file by passing an absolute path or open a symlink in the dir that contains an absolute path pointing to another file in the dir, it would still show as an absolute path
[05:22:21] <jaawerth> so I would look closer at the specific cases where you see it showing as absolute
[05:23:01] <jaawerth> oh wait sorry no, it depends on how you're viewin it. i was thining CTRL-g which is just always absolute, lol
[05:23:09] <jaawerth> but the latter is how resolve() acts
[05:23:19] <jaawerth> er, the above explanation I mean
[05:24:06] <jaawerth> (and ctrl-g doesn't resolve symlinnks but resolve() does)
[05:27:41] *** Joins: cliluw (~cliluw@47.147.77.43)
[05:27:44] <jaawerth> ddickstein[m]: anyway I think it depends on what exactly you're looking at that's displaying the path. it should gnerally show as relative to pwd when it can, though, afaik, since that's what expand('%') does

[06:56:28] <gabehollombeGabe> Hey all.  I'm using NvChad with neovim and I'm trying to figure out why my python buffer isn't attaching to the python LSP client.  ^  Can anyone help me out?

[07:15:39] <mjlbach[m]> gabehollombe (Gabe Hollombe): are you using stock nvchad?
[07:15:48] <mjlbach[m]> or is there some "chadrc" or something

[07:21:29] <zachel[m]> The stock one shouldn't have any lsp clients set up, probably a modified chadrc pointing to custom lspconfig configuration.
[07:21:30] <gabehollombeGabe> @atrius:matrix.org nothing in chadrc.  in my lua/custom/init.lua I added `require'lspconfig'.pyright.setup{}` is all
[07:21:59] <gabehollombeGabe> @zachel:fairydust.space  I didn't know there was an NvChad matrix. I'll take this question there if @atrius:matrix.org prefers =-)

[14:27:55] <ii14[m]> yeah, i shouldn't do that, you probably have some autocommand on bufwrite event or something like that
[14:28:17] <ii14[m]> or you're printing something before/after you did :w
[14:36:57] <bluemonksr[m]> <ii14[m]> "yeah, i shouldn't do that, you..." <- I dont know if this is relevant, but I do have the lsp format_sync in `BufWritePre`
[14:37:35] <ii14[m]> is it just the "press enter" text or does it say something more?
[14:38:41] <bluemonksr[m]> yes its the "press enter" stuff. But trouble is, the rest of my function executes when while I wait to "press enter". so the rest of the function gets executed over the prewritten buffer and not the written buffer
[14:40:14] <ii14[m]> shouldn't happen, this function is supposed to be synchronous

[17:54:25] <hexa-> not sure, but :mes works after a restart
[17:54:29] <hexa-> so possibly
[17:54:46] <ii14[m]> it just prints previous messages
[17:55:54] <ii14[m]> so make it throw error again and then run :mes to scroll over the error messages
[17:56:44] <ii14[m]> you should be able to scroll with j/k
[17:56:48] <hexa-> ok
[17:56:56] <ii14[m]> I think it should also work when the error first happens

[18:08:45] <ii14[m]> what I'm mainly worried about is that it could be compiled against older treesitter version

[19:24:48] <clason[m]> I'd like to avoid a "hostile takeover" (that's never pleasant), but "more actively maintained" is a perfectly objective reason for switching.

[19:26:13] <mjlbach[m]> if you keep spamming messages you'll get banned
[19:26:19] <lordmzte> its the best scripting languages. its super performant, its got powerful semantics, sane syntax, and its not a lisp dialect. perfect
[19:26:36] <clason[m]> yeah, I was about to write that, but I've learned the hard way that switching parsers is breaking for a lot of people (even when it shouldn't be)
[19:26:44] <blacked> ` and its not a lisp dialect` tell me more about it ? what it means?
[19:26:49] <goodfella> clason[m]: is it safe to say that termguicolors enables more colors in the terminal ? 
[19:26:50] <blacked> is there anything wrong with that?
[19:26:51] <clason[m]> so I'd like to minimize those switches
[19:27:01] <clason[m]> goodfella: yes.
[19:27:04] <clason[m]> that is the whole point
[19:27:06] <LeoNerd> clason[m]: Weeeellllmaybe. There's some pretty fundamental mistakes in this current grammar, which will require quite large structural changes. E.g. it believes that variable declaration is an entire kind of *statement* (e.g. `my $one = 1`) rather than, as is the case, just a kind of expression that can live anywhere (e.g. `printf "one is %d\n", my $one = 1;`)

[19:27:12] <lordmzte> as a dev whos used embeddable lua, i can safely say that lua is the most comfortable one to use too

[19:27:15] <clason[m]> (~24 million more, to be precise)
[19:27:20] <BennyPowers[m]> I've been enjoying learning lua. the limited syntax and library are a nice feature
[19:27:32] <LeoNerd> Fixing *that* and several other mistakes is going to end up making the entire result basically completely different from what it is now
[19:27:49] <clason[m]> yeah
[19:28:01] <blacked> mjlbach[m] :O =L  but i was leanring it , thinking `programmable programming langauge` and `meta programming`
[19:28:03] <blacked> hackable
[19:28:27] <goodfella> clason[m]: so :hi Normal guibg=None is the prefered method
[19:28:30] <clason[m]> To be honest, I don't know what the best approach here is.
[19:28:46] <LeoNerd> It'd be best if I could at least get a reply from the original author... 
[19:28:49] <lordmzte> blacked: great! you can make the language jankier without even forking the compiler!
[19:28:53] <LeoNerd> But lacking that it's hard to decide, indeed

[19:31:35] <clason[m]> s/to/do/
[19:31:55] <LeoNerd> clason[m]: There's a *hint* on one of the Issue replies, about the current plan:    my $self = shift;
[19:31:59] <LeoNerd> err.. clipboard fail
[19:32:01] <LeoNerd> https://github.com/ganezdragon/tree-sitter-perl/pull/3#issuecomment-888495627
[19:32:19] <LeoNerd> Suggests: they're wanting to use it as a langserv...
[19:33:13] <clason[m]> yeah, I saw that -- I think I even mentioned that a while back (as the dev having a different aim for the parser than highlighting, and therefore legitimately different design choices).
[19:33:45] <clason[m]> ...which would make the argument for switching parsers even stronger
[19:34:09] <LeoNerd> Mmmmhm
[19:34:15] *** Quits: crashrep (~crashrep@user/crashrep) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[19:36:45] <clason[m]> To summarize: there are two issues here:
[19:36:45] <clason[m]> 1. on the nvim-treesitter side: switching parsers for the same language is breaking for many users, so not to be done lightly;
[19:36:45] <clason[m]> 2. on the upstream parser side: how to fork and replace a (somewhat active) project gracefully
[19:37:17] <LeoNerd> Yah
[19:37:56] <LeoNerd> Imean... the current perl treesitter parser is so broken as to be basically useless for current users *anyway*, so... In this instance I don't think switching is going to upset many people
[19:38:26] *** Quits: Limits (~Limits@user/Limits) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[19:38:34] <LeoNerd> By "broken" I mean, I have files where it gets halfway down and then several hundred lines of source code are just not highlighted at all, beacuse of some tiny thing the parser is slightly confused about on one line of code
[19:38:44] <clason[m]> No, the problem is just the fact that the parser has changed will break people's setup

[19:42:53] <LeoNerd> OK
[19:43:04] <clason[m]> So my concern would be about long-term (or even just medium-term) maintenance of your fork.
[19:43:31] <clason[m]> Depending on how opinionated you are, you might want to share maintenance of the parser.
[19:43:43] <LeoNerd> Well,.. given I'm 1/3 of the current Perl Steering Council, and justabout the only person in the world actually adding nontrivial syntax additions to Perl at the moment,.. I can't think of anyone else who would be better placed to write it

There may be some bikeshedding on the queries for consistency with other languages, but that should be all.

[22:39:41] <SeanDewar[m]> maybe one hack you can do is to define them in batches
[22:39:46] <s00pcan[m]> It's not like anyone needs an iabbrev added right now. It can be done anytime.
[22:39:53] <SeanDewar[m]> aka a few abbreviations per event loop step

[22:40:03] <s00pcan[m]> I'll take any crazy idea
[22:42:11] <s00pcan[m]> SeanDewar[m]: so, I convert it into a list of tuples and loop over it an execute iabbrev commands with those as arguments. How do I get it to not block?
[22:42:42] <SeanDewar[m]> could try abusing timer_start(0, ...) as you're using vimscript
[22:43:00] <SeanDewar[m]> i dunno how that'll work in vim however, but i'd imagine itd have a similiar effect to yielding a bit
