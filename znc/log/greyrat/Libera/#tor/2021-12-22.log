[16:07:53] <iv4nshm4k0v> xx: I guess I will, but a. it's concerning anyway, and b. one of my servers runs a Tor relay as well, so it got blocked, which is a problem I now need to solve.
[16:09:11] <xx> relay (middle node) got blocked? That's somewhat rare.
[16:09:34] <xx> usually it's access to entry nodes, and then access from exit nodes
[16:17:47] *** Joins: winterflaw (~winterfla@gateway/tor-sasl/winterflaw)
[16:27:51] <iv4nshm4k0v> Actually, I'm not sure; it's certainly /not/ an exit node, but it may be configured as 'entry' as well.
