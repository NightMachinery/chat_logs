[15:26:35] <Guest93> Hi. How can I perform multiple tests of a same file in 'if' condition without repeating file name?
[15:26:35] <Guest93> if "/etc/os-release".IO.f && "/etc/os-release".IO.r and ... {
[15:26:36] <Guest93>   CODE
[15:26:36] <Guest93> }
[15:26:37] <Guest93> So I would like to get rid of repeating "/etc/os-release" multiple times. For me it's very common to call boolean methods on same object in one 'if' condition, so I wonder if there is a short Perl-ish form of it.
[15:27:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> You could deal with the topic variable I think
[15:27:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> either using "given" or in this case, I find it tempting to just use "andthen"
[15:28:03] <Guest93> $_ doesn't work in 'if' condition
[15:28:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> which is a closer equivalent of "with"
[15:29:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it does, why wouldn't it
[15:29:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> if "/etc/os-release".IO andthen .f && .r and ... {
[15:29:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> }
[15:29:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> however, dor this .f and .r business, I would expect that there is some smartmatching stuff
[15:29:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and you don't even need to replace the IO in the first place
[15:29:33] <MasterDuke> m: with "tmp".IO { if .e and .d { say "hi" } }     # or  something like this perhaps
[15:29:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar fb749d99e: ( no output )
[15:30:50] <lizmat> .f && .r && .x with "/etc/os-release".IO
[15:31:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> '/etc/os-release'.IO ~~ :f & :r
[15:31:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> this is also correct, isn't it
[15:31:58] <lizmat> that is also correct, but would create the IO object twice
[15:33:08] <Guest93> >>> if "/etc/os-release".IO andthen .f && .r and ... {
[15:33:08] <Guest93> WORKS!!
[15:33:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> that sounds optimizable though, not an inherent treat of the syntax?
[15:33:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I love this andthen, Jan Krňávek for president
[15:37:02] <Guest93> >> MasterDuke 13:59:33
[15:37:03] <Guest93> >> m: with "tmp".IO { if .e and .d { say "hi" } }     # or  something like this perhaps
[15:37:03] <Guest93> also nice tip. THANK you!!

[15:39:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the difference between `with` and `given` is that `with` skips on missing value

[15:41:39] <lizmat> yes, it does... you can't mix with and if like that

[15:42:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and andthen enforces boolean context, right?

[19:21:14] <japhb> You don't need termios unless you're doing raw *input*.

[19:59:48] <[Coke]> have something working on windows that puts a header and a terminal spinners bar on the last two lines while the viewport is everything above that. need to dynamically get the console size, and reset the viewport when done so that I don't have to hit enter to get past the progress bar.
[20:01:00] <[Coke]> (and wrap it up into a module instead of a bunch of hard coded stuff)
[20:01:14] <[Coke]> (and make it work on linux)
[20:04:48] <[Coke]> can we get raku into the microsoft store?
