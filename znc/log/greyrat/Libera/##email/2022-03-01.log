[18:46:41] <lunaphyte> either can be made to work, conceptually speaking

[23:46:50] <lunaphyte> could it be fine, with time and effort on your part?  sure, possibly - even plausibly
[23:51:05] <pekster> It's a question of where you want the management & administration to be. If you'd rather pay a company to deal with that including support if you have issues sending (misconfigurations, refused mail, email blacklists, etc) then that it may be worth paying a service for.
[23:51:41] <pekster> You can do that yourself too, but then the administration responsibility is internal, meaning you need in-house talent to set it up, ensure it's working right (and updated for security needs!) plus address & fix problems.
