[00:59:55] <BUSY> where can i find what the different block version bits signal?
[01:01:20] <belcher> BUSY those signal bits only have meaning during a soft fork deployment, so look at the bip documents for various soft forks like segwit, taproot, op_ctlv, op_csv
[01:01:33] <belcher> i think segwit is bip141, op_cltv is bip65
[01:02:07] <BUSY> i found this (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009/assignments.mediawiki) but assumed there were more - i'll check those bips out, thank you!

[17:32:55] <dodo> buying bitcoin to buy just one thing sounds very.. inefficient
[17:33:52] <treeman7> https://i.imgur.com/BEbELYY.png this is the total fee?

[17:35:40] <Victorsueca> treeman7: fees are calculated using the amount of storage in bytes that the transaction weighs, the amount of money being sent is irrelevant because internally it's just a floating point number

[17:42:40] <TikityTik> can anyone explain why hashes (the stuff that's mined) is useful for making transactions/blocks trusted?
[17:43:03] <dodo> TikityTik: mines need to work to get one
[17:43:13] <dodo> miners
[17:43:22] <TikityTik> i guess it just makes it so the blockchain can't be tempered with historically
[17:43:39] <TikityTik> so basically the last block is untrusted right?
[17:43:55] <dodo> not really, no, but for big amounts you want to wait a bit
[17:44:11] <TikityTik> why then?
[17:44:23] <dodo> you can trust later blocks more
[17:44:32] <buZz> you will need billions of usd of hw and power to edit 1 block back
[17:44:39] <buZz> and even more to go >1 block back
[17:44:44] <dodo> but for a small transaction, you can even trust it before it's mined
[17:44:50] <buZz> to not even make a million in profit
[17:45:00] <buZz> so, unlikely that anyone -will- do that
[17:45:09] <buZz> but possible
[17:45:16] <dodo> TikityTik: even if a different block wins in the end, the same transactions should still confirm, as they are picked by highest fee

[18:23:17] <belcher> TikityTik yes, seed phrase standards like bip39 and electrum's standard all have an option to add an encryption passphrase (sometimes called the "13th word" or "extension word")
[18:23:41] <belcher> though as you surely know, if you lose that passphrase your money is gone, so be careful hah
[18:24:11] <belcher> but its not a bad idea, then you can write down the words on paper and have a relatively simple passphrase for it so that people who accidently come across the paper cant trivially steal the money

[19:07:00] <belcher> thats one reason multisig is good, suppose you made a 2-of-2 multisig where one key was held on the hardware wallet and the other key was held on your normal computer... then a backdoored hardware wallet couldnt steal your funds because it doesnt have access to your normal computer
[19:07:13] <belcher> and also any malware on your normal computer couldnt steal your funds because they dont have access to your hardware wallet

[21:21:17] <belcher> for when you cross the border
[21:21:21] <belcher> then theres no physical device at all
[21:21:42] <belcher> then when you arrive at your destination obtain a wallet (maybe install linux on a new machine or something) and type in the words
[21:21:59] <TikityTik> oh so it's not like RSA where you unlock the secret key via a passphrase?
[21:22:08] <belcher> it can be
[21:22:23] <belcher> usually your wallet generates these 12 random words, if you want you can add an encryption passphrase
[21:22:25] <TikityTik> what is it called? i thought that was seedphrase
[21:22:33] <TikityTik> oh i see
[21:22:36] <belcher> if you were crossing the border you would opt to not have the encryption passphrase, just use the 12 words
[21:22:52] <TikityTik> well i can just setup a new wallet for that
[21:23:04] <gribble> depending on how much trouble you expect at the border crossing. you said escaping the country implying that it may be difficult to get out without having your stuff confiscated... your own memory is probably best in that case
[21:23:27] <TikityTik> yeah i would have to escape without border patrol checking me, not sure how i'm gonna accomplish that lol

[21:24:21] <TikityTik> i mean i could have family tell me the passphrase too once i'm over there
[21:24:34] <belcher> no point tbh
[21:24:49] <TikityTik> seedphrase*
[21:25:07] <belcher> anyone who eavesdrops on the phone could steal your funds if you do that btw
[21:25:30] <belcher> a better way would be to tell your family one of your bitcoin addresses over the phone, and then they send bitcoins to it
[21:25:50] <NoImNotNineVolt> ^
[21:26:10] <TikityTik> i mean they could just send me a letter with the seedphrase in it
[21:26:13] <as2334> not too good if you assume the phone is compromised tho
[21:26:18] <nanotube> letters can be intercepted
[21:26:21] <TikityTik> i.e. a story that has seedphrases in it
[21:26:22] <belcher> anyone who reads the letter can steal the funds
[21:26:30] <belcher> the seed phrase has to be secret, anyone who sees it can steal the funds
[21:26:36] <NoImNotNineVolt> the phone compromise would have to be extensive.
[21:26:37] <belcher> its not meant to be transmitted to anyone else
[21:26:44] <NoImNotNineVolt> i.e. the ability to impersonate you
[21:26:51] <NoImNotNineVolt> to your family. lol.
[21:27:05] <TikityTik> i mean where you send a letter/story where it contains the seedphrase as part of it
[21:27:12] <NoImNotNineVolt> phone eavesdropping wouldn't be an issue.
[21:27:14] <TikityTik> like every 10th letter is the seedphrase

[21:27:37] <NoImNotNineVolt> TikityTik: that's the worst steganography i've ever heard of :P
[21:27:41] <belcher> if you want to send bitcoins then actually send them, create a bitcoin transaction
[21:27:52] <belcher> seed phrases are meant to be a backup, not a method of transmitting
[21:28:05] <TikityTik> it's more that i don't want my old relatives to mess with crypto if they don't know how to startup a computer
[21:28:17] <NoImNotNineVolt> then don't give them your seed phrase.
[21:28:49] <belcher> one option is to write it on paper and once you're safe on the other side you can tell them over the phone to burn the paper
[21:28:57] <NoImNotNineVolt> giving your seed phrase to "old relatives" who "don't know how to startup a computer" seems like a great way of losing your money.

[21:29:57] <NoImNotNineVolt> considering that one of the core premises of bitcoin is eliminating a need for trust, i'm surprised to hear that all of these ideas heavily depend on trusting third parties.
[21:30:16] <belcher> trusting your own family seems fair enough tbh
[21:30:24] <NoImNotNineVolt> if your plan involves trusting someone else, think of a better plan.
[21:30:27] <belcher> its just that his family doesnt know how to turn on a computer, so it wont work as well

[21:38:44] <andytoshi> NoImNotNineVolt: https://github.com/apoelstra/SSS32/blob/2021-12--intro/intro.md is the scheme, but again, it's super rough and in a pre-alpha stage and i really would not recommend people use it until it's done
[21:38:58] <andytoshi> but if somebody needs to cross a border in the immediate future, it's usable enough
[21:39:22] <andytoshi> e.g. i've used it to transport secrets within the US on domestic flights, where there is a small (but nonzero) risk that TSA agents will read any secrets you are carrying
[21:40:28] <NoImNotNineVolt> i used to talk lots of shit about DHS until they towed my boat to shore for free :P
[21:40:29] <andytoshi> but having said this --- if the threat model here involves a high likelihood of interception, memorization would be a better strategy
[21:40:48] <NoImNotNineVolt> they've bought my complicity :P
[21:41:02] <andytoshi> and if this person can't cross the border multiple times, splitting the key into ciphertext+key doesn't help
[21:41:10] <NoImNotNineVolt> yup.
[21:41:25] <andytoshi> one benefit of this is that it's so insane and rough-draft that if it _is_ intercepted nobody will figure out what to do with it
[21:41:30] <NoImNotNineVolt> this is super cool, though. thanks.

[21:42:26] <andytoshi> belcher: yes, this stuff looks extremely suspicious
[21:42:28] <belcher> btw andytoshi would encryption also work for the US-domestic-flight thing? or can TSA agents force you to decrypt something
[21:42:46] <belcher> yes memorization has the great advantage that nobody can see it in your head
[21:42:57] <andytoshi> belcher: i don't think they can, but even if so, my threat model is not that they've taken me aside and are interrogating me
[21:43:07] <andytoshi> it's just "have they opened my stuff and exposed my keys to their cameras and eyes"
[21:43:40] <NoImNotNineVolt> depends where. there's the border search exception.
[21:43:58] <belcher> sounds like encryption would work just as well then
[21:44:03] <NoImNotNineVolt> there's that case of a guy held in comtempt for not revealing a password, etc.
[21:44:10] <andytoshi> belcher: it'd be an interesting philosophical fight if i were carrying two shamir secret shares, and they wanted me to "decrypt" them, and i argued that both secrets equally contributed to the actual secret and that either one could be considered a meaningless/random key unrelated to the data

[21:45:08] <andytoshi> i just don't have an encryption scheme on-hand that i trust as much as paper computing

[21:46:41] <andytoshi> NoImNotNineVolt: that's fair, but like, the math here is very simple and i've written up an argument for its correctness. and the paper worksheets etc are written in hand-ritten postscrript that you can review

[21:48:09] <andytoshi> it's an interesting argument "home-rolled paper computer encryption scheme". the point of using pen and paper here is that it's super transparent. i'll talk to my coauthor and see if we can address this somehow
[21:48:42] <andytoshi> NoImNotNineVolt: fwiw this isn't an encryption scheme. it's shamir secret sharing which can actually be mathematically proven to be information-theoretically secure
[21:48:58] <NoImNotNineVolt> i think it would help to have a number of unbiased third parties who are recognized authorities in cryptosystem audit it.

[21:52:20] <NoImNotNineVolt> "trust you" is a bigger ask than "trust you and a bunch of unbiased third party authorities"
[21:52:25] <andytoshi> so -- fwiw we are definitely not targeting average people with this scheme. we are targeting people who are kinda comfortable with math, and very *un*comfortable with computers
[21:52:28] <NoImNotNineVolt> (though i guess neither is a substitute for actual validation of proof)
[21:52:37] <NoImNotNineVolt> fair enough.
[21:52:56] <NoImNotNineVolt> i used to be comfortable with math. and then i got a job as a developer in industry.
[21:52:59] <NoImNotNineVolt> :'(
[21:53:00] <andytoshi> and also, consider the trust model here -- suppose i'm lying and have compromised this scheme. how can that hurt you? you are just doing a bunch of work on paper
[21:53:19] <andytoshi> i guess i could reduce the entropy of your secrets somehow, but it's hard to see how i could do that and still have a reversible scheme
[21:53:33] <NoImNotNineVolt> andytoshi: well, if you're acting on behalf of a state actor, and now that state actor can compromise all the secrets secured by this mechanism..
[21:53:45] <andytoshi> by what physical mechanism?
[21:53:51] <NoImNotNineVolt> physical access.
[21:53:57] <NoImNotNineVolt> i mean, say syrian dissidents start using this
[21:54:05] <NoImNotNineVolt> and you're an agent of the syrian government
[21:54:19] <belcher> could there be some number which is the opposite of a NUMS number
[21:54:21] <NoImNotNineVolt> and every dissident caught with paper circles and gibberish, now their secrets are decoded by the state
[21:54:28] <andytoshi> ok, yeah, i see. so imagine that the "secret sharing" doesn't actually split, so the secret can be revealed by the individual shares
[21:54:30] <NoImNotNineVolt> etc
[21:54:32] <belcher> which results in the secrets being produced actually being decryptable
[21:54:54] <andytoshi> NoImNotNineVolt: well, if every secret holder gets caught, they're fucked. the scheme explicitly does not protect against all shares being compromised
[21:55:37] <NoImNotNineVolt> is it not possible that this scheme produces shares, each of which could independently reconstruct the secret?
[21:55:44] <NoImNotNineVolt> i mean, i could come up with such a scheme.

[22:26:04] <TikityTik> why should i not utilize secret keys?
[22:26:15] <belcher> for a number of reasons
[22:26:22] <belcher> seed phrases are the standard for bitcoin wallets
[22:26:41] <TikityTik> i thought hardware wallets are devices that hold your secret key?
[22:26:42] <belcher> one reason is that secret keys dont have error correction, if you get one letter or number wrong in the serialization then you get a completely different wallet
[22:26:53] <belcher> yes but hardware wallets still only give users seed phrases
[22:26:59] <belcher> or let them type in seed phrases
[22:27:55] <TikityTik> what you mean only give seed phrases? i thought those seedphrases are backups incase you fuck with your wallet?
[22:28:02] <TikityTik> oh right there's a seed in there
[22:28:25] <belcher> yes seed phrases are backups
[22:28:45] <belcher> no good wallet lets you touch individual secret keys
[22:28:57] <TikityTik> so how does the secret key get transferred then?
[22:29:00] <TikityTik> well the contents
[22:29:12] <belcher> seed phrases encode a big list of secret keys
[22:29:34] <belcher> an infinitely long list in fact

[22:33:25] <TikityTik> oh so there's a literal CPU that digitally signs within the hardware wallet?
[22:33:33] <belcher> yes
[22:33:33] <TikityTik> a literal CPU inside the wallet

[22:43:28] <TikityTik> isn't a seedphrase incredibly insecure as you only need to bruteforce 24 words vs rsa 4098

[22:43:50] <TikityTik> 4096*
[22:44:22] <TikityTik> from my understanding you can generate the same private key anywhere as long as you input the correct 24 words
[22:44:59] <belcher> there are 2048 words, so thats 2^11, and with 12 words that gives you 2^132, which is secure
[22:45:15] <TikityTik> and can't people just find random wallets by brute forcing 24 words until they find a wallet with money?
[22:45:21] <belcher> rsa's 4098 bit key size doesnt actually give you log(4098) security, because rsa needs bigger keys
[22:45:46] <belcher> you cant because that would take to longer than the age of the universe, the number of possibilities is too big
[22:46:10] <dodo> so you're saying it's possible ;)
[22:46:39] <belcher> wanna race? :p
[22:46:41] <belcher> you go first

[22:52:25] <TikityTik> belcher, why do you say log(4098) isn't it 2^4096 security as that's how many possible keys there are?
[22:52:35] <TikityTik> log(4096) i mean
[22:53:01] <belcher> rsa has some flaws which means the keys have to be bigger for the same security
[22:53:59] <TikityTik> but generally speaking when you say a 2048 bit key size that should be 2^2048 possible keys in the key space no?
[22:54:24] <TikityTik> ignoring algorithm flaws

[22:56:28] <TikityTik> so if I bootup an "insecure machine" where it has windows but I instead boot via a live USB and plugin my hardware wallet, is that considered secure?
