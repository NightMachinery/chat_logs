[00:15:08] <Fenderbassist> good on you
[00:15:13] <Fenderbassist> retro fun
[00:15:38] <Bco1981> that was respons to the quote
[00:15:45] <Fenderbassist> oh I see
[00:15:52] <Fenderbassist> I thought you completed a DOS system project
[00:15:56] <Fenderbassist> :)
[00:16:11] <Bco1981> naah, not yet, i was sent the wrong gfx
[00:16:18] <Bco1981> just sent it back today.
[00:16:29] <Fenderbassist> ugh bummer
[00:19:10] <Fenderbassist> what were they supposed to send you?
[00:19:35] <Bco1981> a Diamond Viper V330 PCI 4MB
[00:20:30] <Fenderbassist> oh nice
[00:20:30] <Bco1981> i was sent something i had never heard of, a ELSA ErazorIII AGP, some tnt2 card.
[00:20:40] <Fenderbassist> oh I remember those
[00:20:49] <Bco1981> and, one of the resistors was half falling off.
[00:20:55] <Fenderbassist> yeah not for you lol
[00:21:12] <Fenderbassist> the Diamond a more desirable card
[00:21:18] <Bco1981> my 486 mobo don't have agp
[00:21:26] <Fenderbassist> right
[00:22:08] <Fenderbassist> that was more the Pentium MMX Socket 7  / Super Socket 7 AMD K63 era
[00:22:22] <Fenderbassist> K6-3*
[00:22:25] <Bco1981> yeah
[00:22:41] <Fenderbassist> first system I built from parts was a K6-3/450 MHz
[00:22:43] <Bco1981> and i have a asus tnt2 32mb agp for that build
[00:23:02] <Fenderbassist> much better quality than what I recall Elsa being
[00:23:02] <Bco1981> have a k6-3+ 400 on the way
[00:23:07] <Fenderbassist> cool :)
[00:24:01] <Bco1981> supposedly... "new"
[00:24:06] <Fenderbassist> mine ran Mechwarrior just fine lol
[00:24:15] <Fenderbassist> oh old unused stock, nice
[00:24:34] <Fenderbassist> I hope your board doens't have a VIA chipset
[00:24:38] <Fenderbassist> mine did, was a pain in the butt
[00:24:47] <Fenderbassist> should have picked a different one myself
[00:25:04] <Bco1981> i think is is an aladdin5 or something
[00:25:10] <Bco1981> it is*
[00:25:38] <Fenderbassist> mine and a friends were the same board, all the same issues
[00:25:44] <Fenderbassist> constantly fixing them lol
[00:25:52] <Fenderbassist> finally upgraded board and processor to the next generation
[00:26:21] <Bco1981> Ahtlon?
[00:26:37] <Fenderbassist> actually on that one I got a 1.1Ghz Duron
[00:26:48] <Fenderbassist> Celeron equivalent roughly
[00:26:59] <Cryowolf> ah tnt...I remember all the rage over that one
[00:27:01] <Fenderbassist> then gave it to my sister who needed a machine
[00:27:07] <Bco1981> yeah, i think i might have 1 in my basement
[00:27:43] <Fenderbassist> she just emails and eBays / Amazons so was plenty for her at the time
[00:27:45] <Cryowolf> I have one in my closet
[00:27:49] <Fenderbassist> nice
[00:27:51] <Cryowolf> I also have a savage 3d
[00:28:01] <Cryowolf> I think thats what it was called
[00:28:06] <Fenderbassist> unfortunately I gave all my old parts to a friend who was doing PC repair on the side at the time
[00:28:08] <Cryowolf> dont remember why I got it
[00:28:26] <Cryowolf> s3 savage
[00:28:30] <Cryowolf> or something
[00:28:44] <Fenderbassist> early 3d card, cool
[00:29:05] <Cryowolf> I have that in my closet too
[00:29:12] <Cryowolf> it was real shit at running games though
[00:29:56] <Fenderbassist> yeah when the 3d race was first on, some were better than others
[00:30:13] <Fenderbassist> Hercules even came out with a 3d card early on but the chips weren't ideal for the job
[00:30:28] <Fenderbassist> Matrox, Diamond, Voodoo, and similar were better imho
[00:30:34] <Bco1981> the diamond viper v330 was among those, the first nvidia model riva 128
[00:30:37] <Cryowolf> I think 3dfx were the distributor of the savage
[00:30:39] <Fenderbassist> depending on whom wrote the game
[00:30:54] <Cryowolf> or maybe it wasnt
[00:30:56] <Fenderbassist> could be, I don't recall
[00:31:10] <Cryowolf> I know my first graphic card was the voodoo2
[00:31:28] <Cryowolf> then tnt, then savage 3d, then only a month or two after, tnt2
[00:31:29] <Bco1981> i 3 of those in my basement... need to test them
[00:31:32] <Fenderbassist> it was my second, the Voodoo 2 3000
[00:31:33] <Bco1981> have*
[00:31:42] <Cryowolf> I dont remember what I got after tnt2
[00:31:50] <Fenderbassist> my first was an ATI card, trying to remember what it was
[00:31:57] <Fenderbassist> long before AMD bought them
[00:31:58] <Cryowolf> I think it was an ati card
[00:32:06] <Fenderbassist> ah I had a Rage card I think
[00:32:14] <Bco1981> ati rage XL
[00:32:20] <Bco1981> usually
[00:32:20] <Fenderbassist> yeah something like that
[00:32:46] <Fenderbassist> those were the days lol
[00:33:00] <Fenderbassist> manually setting jumpers on boards
[00:33:02] <Fenderbassist> :D
[00:33:09] <Bco1981> yaas
[00:33:34] <Cryowolf> might have been radeon 7500 or something
[00:33:38] <Cryowolf> or 7200
[00:34:14] <Cryowolf> I switched back and forth between ati and nvidia
[00:34:35] *** Quits: Mr_Misery (~weechat@27.34.108.11) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0.1)
[00:35:34] <Fenderbassist> I miss buying the Computer Shopper magazines, with the reviews and the many many classifieds
[00:35:39] <Cryowolf> at some point I got a geforce, donmt remember what number
[00:35:42] <Cryowolf> then another geforce
[00:35:59] <Cryowolf> then they started with the weird numbering
[00:36:09] <Bco1981> geforce 256 was after the tnt2
[00:36:10] <Fenderbassist> yeah things did twist a bit
[00:36:11] <Cryowolf> which I still don't get
[00:36:36] <Bco1981> iirc
[00:37:02] <Cryowolf> after the tnt2 I think I ended up getting 256, cause I remember that name so well...then I got an ati card, then nvidia again, nvidia again, then ati, then nvidia, then amd, then amd, then nvidia
[00:37:17] <Cryowolf> and here we are
[00:37:18] <Fenderbassist> I think I replaced the Voodoo 2 3000 16MB card with a Geforce 2 64MB card, I believe
[00:37:40] <Fenderbassist> you sound like a dedicated gamer :)
[00:37:44] <Cryowolf> I slowed down a lot on the graphic card purchases when I had to pay for them myself
[00:37:48] <Cryowolf> lol
[00:37:50] <Fenderbassist> lol
[00:38:13] <Cryowolf> I used to be quite the gamer yeah, 8-12 hours a day of gaming when I didnt have school
[00:38:20] <Cryowolf> otherwise cram as much in as possible
[00:39:27] <Cryowolf> but then in my mid 20s those 8-12 hours turned into 3-4, then into 0-4 and then into "when there's a new game I like I'll pause life and play it 12+ hours a day until Im done with it"
[00:39:31] <Fenderbassist> par for the course, I've known many such serious hobbyists
[00:39:31] <Cryowolf> and thats where I am now
[00:40:11] <Cryowolf> I just can't find the dedication or the energy to play anything like an FPS all day long
[00:40:29] <Cryowolf> I could play a competitive card game maybe 4-5 hours a day
[00:40:56] <Bco1981> mshearts
[00:40:59] <Fenderbassist> time goes by, priorities change
[00:41:01] <Cryowolf> or if they come up with something more similar to JRPG battles
[00:41:18] <Cryowolf> its not so much priority changes, it's just that I don't care as much
[00:41:19] <Fenderbassist> I used to play MMORPGs and be in guilds, on Ventrillo or something
[00:41:33] <Fenderbassist> I still talk to people I gamed with back in the early 2000s
[00:41:42] <Cryowolf> right now I have all day every day to play if Iwant
[00:41:45] <Fenderbassist> as a player or as a lower level GM
[00:41:46] <Cryowolf> I have nothing else to do
[00:42:01] <Cryowolf> do you know what Ultima Online was?
[00:42:04] <Cryowolf> didyou play it?
[00:42:28] <Fenderbassist> no I didn't play that one, I was on T4C (The Fourth Coming), Conquer Online and 
[00:42:33] <Cryowolf> ah
[00:42:37] <Fenderbassist> one other whose name is escaping me at the moment
[00:42:54] <Fenderbassist> the only one I'm on now is SWTOR (Star Wars: The Old Republic
[00:43:05] <Fenderbassist> Guild leader quit the game completely, handed me the guild lol
[00:43:07] <Cryowolf> I was a councilor in that game (volunteer support staff) and later switched to the companion team and became a senior companion, where I was in charge of a staff of companions.
[00:43:15] <Fenderbassist> very nice
[00:43:17] <Cryowolf> then they shut down the volunteer program cause of new rules
[00:43:19] <Cryowolf> laws
[00:43:24] <Fenderbassist> gotcha
[00:43:26] <Fenderbassist> happens
[00:43:30] <Cryowolf> I was still too young to be hired
[00:43:36] <Cryowolf> so...I didnt get a job
[00:43:38] <Fenderbassist> I liked the community of MMORPGs, certain ones
[00:43:40] <Fenderbassist> I see
[00:43:53] <Cryowolf> then EA bought Origin and said "fuck off" to every st aff member
[00:43:55] <Fenderbassist> the game I liked with the community that was most toxic was World Of Tanks lol
[00:44:02] <Fenderbassist> oh that sucks
[00:44:35] <Cryowolf> SWTOR was fun but I hear the expansions dont have as much choices and branching even on different classes
[00:44:51] <Fenderbassist> it's ok in some ways, so so in others
[00:45:04] <Fenderbassist> I already maxed out a healer and lost the desire to make more characters lol
[00:45:12] <Fenderbassist> I just hop on to keep an eye on things
[00:45:15] <Fenderbassist> Imperial side
[00:45:27] <Fenderbassist> I have a Republic character but don't use it much
[00:45:28] <Cryowolf> I played as a sith warrior, a sith lord or whatever theyre called...the dps one, as a imperial spy or whatever and as a bounty hunter
[00:45:35] <Fenderbassist> very nice
[00:45:45] <Cryowolf> completed every class and story quest
[00:45:45] <Fenderbassist> there was a huge shortage of healers so I just stuck with healer
[00:45:49] <Fenderbassist> an Imperial Agent
[00:45:53] *** Quits: anthk_ (~anthk@92.176.105.30) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:46:04] <Fenderbassist> so you are a Legendary Player
[00:46:12] <Cryowolf> the sith warrior was a fairly strange story
[00:46:14] <Cryowolf> a what?
[00:46:28] <Fenderbassist> a Legendary Player is someone that has played all the classes
[00:46:32] <Cryowolf> oh
[00:46:34] <Fenderbassist> and reached 75 on each
[00:46:43] <Cryowolf> I havent reached 75 on each
[00:46:48] <Fenderbassist> so close :)
[00:46:48] <Cryowolf> max was 50 back then :P
[00:46:57] <Cryowolf> or something
[00:46:57] *** Joins: aluna (~aluna@user/aluna)
[00:47:00] <Fenderbassist> ah they are up to 306 gear now
[00:47:08] <Fenderbassist> up from 280
[00:47:35] <Cryowolf> I liked playing as a sorcerer, I didnt like the sith warrior in groups
[00:47:35] <Fenderbassist> running flashpoints now makes it easier to get the drops
[00:47:41] <Cryowolf> so many fucking buttons for a sith marauder
[00:48:07] <Fenderbassist> yeah I don't envy that rotation
[00:48:13] <Fenderbassist> is why I stuck with Agent lol
[00:48:19] <Fenderbassist> I'll heal, and watch you guys blow everything up lol
[00:48:26] <Cryowolf> most fun for me was sorcerer and agent or what the dps version was killed
[00:48:36] <Cryowolf> the bounty hunter was ok, but a little dull
[00:48:50] <Cryowolf> the imperial agent was fun cause I was tasked with killing sith lords
[00:49:00] <Fenderbassist> same for me, I got to 30-40 with that and got tired of it
[00:49:03] <Cryowolf> and they thought I was this puny little servant right up until their last breath
[00:49:24] <Cryowolf> as a sith warrior, the final moments when I met the council were rather rewarding
[00:49:29] <Fenderbassist> leveling your companions to influence lvl 50 helped
[00:49:36] <Cryowolf> having every Sith Lord bowing before me
[00:49:55] *** Parts: aluna (~aluna@user/aluna) (Using Circe, the loveliest of all IRC clients)
[00:50:12] <Cryowolf> I mean technically they bowed to the emperor as I was his "wrath" (his hand)
[00:50:19] <Cryowolf> but still
[00:50:20] <Fenderbassist> I see, sounds fun
[00:50:31] <Cryowolf> you know the big grunt the sorcerer gets?
[00:50:36] <Cryowolf> companion
[00:50:45] <Fenderbassist> the demon?
[00:50:50] <Fenderbassist> or the soldier?
[00:50:57] <Cryowolf> demon? no he was a species of some sort
[00:51:04] <Cryowolf> tall, grunt
[00:51:13] <Cryowolf> in the literal sense
[00:51:17] <Cryowolf> not in the colloquial sense
[00:51:24] <Fenderbassist> I've seen it, I didn't have one 
[00:51:38] <Cryowolf> he liked being treated like a slave basically
[00:51:58] <Cryowolf> when we met someone new I would tell him "Announce me beast"
[00:52:04] <Fenderbassist> lol
[00:52:25] <Cryowolf> and when he cut into a conversation I would say "Be silent hound, you're here to obey me"
[00:52:34] <Cryowolf> and that would gain me influence
[00:52:47] <Cryowolf> but I think thats cause his species is hierarchal
[00:52:56] <Fenderbassist> could be
[00:52:57] <Cryowolf> and if he's to have a master then they can't be weak
[00:53:06] <Cryowolf> or treat him soft
[00:53:28] <Fenderbassist> if you ever hop on and want a healer to run through flashpoints to upgrade your gear, let me know
[00:53:41] <Cryowolf> I havent been on in a decade but thanks
[00:53:47] <Fenderbassist> all my companions are maxed out in influence, as is my gear
[00:53:51] <Fenderbassist> no worries
[00:53:54] <Cryowolf> I would only hop on to play the new story
[00:54:03] <Cryowolf> but I dunno if its worth it
[00:54:09] <Fenderbassist> if you ever do, make sure to upgrade gear first
[00:54:16] <Fenderbassist> the new stories can be a challenge
[00:54:26] <Cryowolf> since they pretty much erase everything I did the moment the expansion begins
[00:54:43] <Cryowolf> its akin to a movie being a dream
[00:54:52] <Fenderbassist> I did the last expansion
[00:54:59] <Cryowolf> like "Oh all this? Heh fuck you, we're resetting you"
[00:55:03] <Fenderbassist> there is yet another one
[00:55:08] <Fenderbassist> they keep adding more and more
[00:55:30] <Cryowolf> do I get my companions back? Does anything I did matter? Does the story branch at all depending on my class and what I did pre-expansion?
[00:55:40] <Fenderbassist> you get your companions back
[00:55:46] <Cryowolf> all of em?
[00:55:54] <Fenderbassist> and your pre-expansion life is there
[00:55:55] <Fenderbassist> yes
[00:56:09] <Cryowolf> life, what does that mean?
[00:56:10] <Fenderbassist> plus there are new ones and also ones that require special missions to get
[00:56:16] <Cryowolf> I mean...its been like a few years
[00:56:17] <Cryowolf> or more
[00:56:48] <Fenderbassist> you're not forced out of the ability to use the fleet station or all the traditional planets / heroics / flashpoints / group runs
[00:56:59] <Cryowolf> Im wondering if my choices and such in classic storyline, matters in the expansions
[00:57:14] <Cryowolf> well of course I'm not but I don't care about that
[00:57:21] <Fenderbassist> not really, it's all a matter of good build and leveled up companion
[00:57:32] <Fenderbassist> knowing your rotation / class
[00:57:44] <Cryowolf> I dont understand what that has to do with the story?
[00:57:45] <Fenderbassist> I did most everything solo
[00:57:55] <Cryowolf> I dont play swtor as an mmo
[00:58:03] <Fenderbassist> oh because the story gets harder once you're done with the main storyline
[00:58:15] <Fenderbassist> 1-75 was just busy work, to me
[00:58:20] <Fenderbassist> the expansion was more challenging fights
[00:58:24] <Cryowolf> Im wondering if my choices in the classic storyline matters or not in the expansion. If they have a direct impact
[00:58:29] <Cryowolf> Im not asking about fights or dungeons
[00:58:30] <Fenderbassist> I found them noticeably harder
[00:58:44] <Cryowolf> they're irrelevant
[00:59:12] <Cryowolf> Im asking if my choices in vanilla has an impact in the expansions
[00:59:15] <Cryowolf> story choices
[00:59:39] <Cryowolf> or maybe youre unfamliar with RPG story branching
[01:00:19] <Cryowolf> do you know what I'm talking about? am I making sense?
[01:00:25] <Cryowolf> maybe Im rambling
[01:01:50] <Fenderbassist> in my one class, when I played the expansion, the storyline was forced upon me, my choices in the initial class storyline didn't make much impact from what I could see
[01:01:59] <Fenderbassist> I was forced by the expansion storyline into storyline fights
[01:02:05] <Cryowolf> so they basically reset i t?
[01:02:07] <Fenderbassist> and some of them were difficult
[01:02:12] <Cryowolf> but I dont care about the fights man
[01:02:35] <Cryowolf> its about the storyline, roleplaying my character, making choices relating to the story. do I do this or do that?
[01:02:42] <Cryowolf> what do I say in this dialogue?
[01:02:56] <Cryowolf> and how does all that impact the continuation of the story
[01:02:58] <Fenderbassist> you should probably read up about it if you're interested, I can't comment on your other classes
[01:03:25] <Fenderbassist> I felt like the last expansion was more "you will go this route"
[01:03:31] <Fenderbassist> and I haven't played the current expansion
[01:03:33] <Cryowolf> no but...you can still answer if your choices in the storyline carried over or not
[01:03:34] <Fenderbassist> so I can't say
[01:03:45] <Fenderbassist> you're sent to a different area
[01:03:54] <Fenderbassist> dealing with different people and different problems
[01:03:55] <Cryowolf> I know you wake up after 10 years or something
[01:03:58] <Cryowolf> or more
[01:04:03] <Fenderbassist> yeah like that
[01:04:25] <Cryowolf> so everything I did has had zero impact on the galaxy and whats going on atm?
[01:05:16] <Cryowolf> I mean becoming a sith lord and taking over territory, acquiring knowledge to find the well of the dark side. Becoming the Wrah of the Emperor and so on.
[01:05:32] <Fenderbassist> I have no idea, I never played one
[01:05:37] <Fenderbassist> so I can't comment
[01:05:42] <Cryowolf> no but Im sure your class did stuff too
[01:05:48] <Cryowolf> I know the imperial agent did
[01:05:58] <Cryowolf> did things that had an impact on the empire
[01:05:59] <Fenderbassist> why don't you look it up online to get a better description than I'm giving you
[01:06:13] <Cryowolf> to get that description I need to real spoilers
[01:06:14] <Cryowolf> read
[01:06:29] <Cryowolf> and going on reddit to find it means I'm not safe from being spoiled for everything
[01:07:04] <Cryowolf> did what you did in classic imperial agent story, mean anything at all or change anything at all in the expansion? Or was it a big reset button?
[01:07:18] <Cryowolf> thats what Im wondering
[01:07:26] <Cryowolf> if everything was just reset or not
[01:07:39] <Fenderbassist> for me, on an Agent, at the end...the Intelligence service was broken up
[01:07:57] <Fenderbassist> which is where I'm at now, haven't done the expansion on him
[01:08:06] <Fenderbassist> I did the expansion on the Repub side character
[01:08:26] <Cryowolf> theres two+ expansions no?
[01:08:36] <Fenderbassist> so far, I think there's a third in the works
[01:08:46] <Cryowolf> ok well...on republic side then, my question remains the same
[01:09:12] <Cryowolf> or maybe you didnt pay attention to it
[01:09:20] <Cryowolf> I mean not everyone was in it for the story
[01:09:39] <Fenderbassist> I don't want to spoil the result for you, since spoilers are a concern
[01:09:50] <Fenderbassist> I will say that the story line felt forced, with really no options other than moving on
[01:10:08] <Fenderbassist> and the end result wasn't expected
[01:10:22] <Fenderbassist> the forced storyline was a long series of fights
[01:10:38] <Fenderbassist> you get new companions, and eventually find all your old companions

[01:10:57] <Fenderbassist> so there you go
[01:11:00] <Cryowolf> okay, I kinda just wanted a yes or no answer though. If my choices had an impact on the expansion
[01:11:12] <Cryowolf> but youre saying that no it didnt?
[01:11:18] <Cryowolf> right?
[01:11:34] <Cryowolf> thats kind of what I feared
[01:11:51] <Cryowolf> the reset button cause they bit off more than they could chew
[01:12:12] <Cryowolf> they couldnt possibly afford to continue the storyline after that with so many classes and all

[01:12:25] <Fenderbassist> could be, I only did one class so I'm not the person to ask

[01:13:30] <Fenderbassist> I logged in my Imperial
[01:13:41] <Fenderbassist> he has 8 companions, hasn't done the expansion
[01:13:59] <Fenderbassist> the Repub char that did do the expansion, has like 30 companions and contacts
[01:14:53] <Cryowolf> but you'd still notice if your choices in your story were noticable in the expansion even if you only played one class
[01:15:05] <Fenderbassist> ok I think we need to stop this line of questioning ;)
[01:15:19] <Fenderbassist> obviously I don't have the info you want
[01:15:34] <Cryowolf> yeah...or we 're not understanding each other
[01:15:35] <Fenderbassist> I've answered the best I can, to me it felt forced
[01:15:39] <Fenderbassist> could be that
[01:15:51] <Fenderbassist> the expansion was really long
[01:15:58] <Fenderbassist> just that one lol
[01:16:16] <Cryowolf> if every storyline choice I made pre-expansion doesn't matter in the expansion, that's a big reset
[01:16:22] <Cryowolf> and thats what Im sorta fearing
[01:16:22] <Fenderbassist> fair enough
[01:16:30] <Cryowolf> is that how it is?

[13:43:13] <darkwitch> the value (for the slightly insane people) is simply the knowledge that you paid money for it, so it's "yours"
[13:43:14] <scherazade> No still you can't make copies it's unique and it has signature of ownership
[13:43:46] <darkwitch> it can be used as an asset, an investment that you sell to even more insane people
[13:44:13] <scherazade> Exactly, people love wasting money so 
[13:44:13] <amigojapan> I see darkwitch 
[13:45:18] <scherazade> You can make your own NFT and sell it at opensea 
[13:47:21] <Urchin[emacs]> the digital object an NFT is tied to still doesn't end up "yours", and anybody can generate an NFT, not just the author, so you're basically paying for a number tied to a digital object to whomever that has no meaning

[22:55:21] <Matt|home> TsundereNoises : it's just bad writing. stargate sg-1 is one of my favorite sci fi series, but my god it flipflops between good and horrifically bad

[22:55:52] <TsundereNoises> Matt|home: I like it a lot too, but honestly I think it's median episode quality is better than a lot of similar shows (but yeah, there are some real turds)
[22:56:14] <TsundereNoises> Matt|home: but like I think there are fewer bad ones than TNG, for example
[22:56:22] <Satin> i missed a chance to get a mental health clinic appoinment today
[22:56:26] <Satin> the first one i'd have
[22:56:31] <TsundereNoises> probably more just okay ones and fewer truly great, but also fewer truly bad

[22:56:46] <Matt|home> oh by and far
[22:56:55] <Satin> and my dad isn't responding to whatsapp my scan yet
[22:57:16] <Matt|home> TsundereNoises : like the episode _right before_ this one is teal'c goes home and sees his wife shacking up with some big black dude, then RIGHT AFTER is daniel's wife gets knocked up
[22:57:26] <Matt|home> and don't get me started on hathor. i don't give a flying fuck what anyone says about emancipation
[22:57:28] <Matt|home> hathor was
[22:57:29] <Satin> and my old phone which would have my health insurance scan on the old whatsapp client logged itself out since i switched phones/the simcard
[22:57:30] <Matt|home> by and large
[22:57:31] <Matt|home> the worst
[22:57:31] <Bco1981> Satin: you're a girl. don't you have a purse?
[22:57:37] <TsundereNoises> Matt|home: oh, season 1?
[22:57:39] <ButterNoodle> lol Matt|home
[22:57:53] <Matt|home> im halfway through S2, and except for the asgard stuff which was cool, i kind of hate S2 with a passion
[22:58:22] <Matt|home> i will say: the replicators (way into the show idk what season) are the best sci fi villains i've come across
[22:58:26] <TsundereNoises> Matt|home: back when I first saw it I liked the hathor episode, but I was young, I agree it's bad in retrospect
[22:59:04] <Matt|home> there's a lot of good shit to praise.. but my god the bad stuff gets really bad. NOT as bad as star trek.. holy fuck star trek episodes had me and my family dying on the floor either laughing or crying
[22:59:06] <TsundereNoises> I think replicators are like the asgard, they did them as a one off and then kept expanding on it later until it became a major plot
[22:59:16] <TsundereNoises> but like I think they first appear a few seasons before they're a big deal
[22:59:20] <Matt|home> stargate just pisses me off with bad episodes because i know they can do so much better
[22:59:31] <Satin> Bco1981: Yes but for various reasons my health insurance card was left back in missouri
[22:59:37] <Matt|home> apparently one of the writers of the show is super heavy into rape fantasy shit, some woman i forget her name, but you can tell which episodes she wrote :\
[22:59:45] <TsundereNoises> yeah, I think TNG in particular has the most PAINFUL bad episodes, moreso than even Voyager
[22:59:45] <Satin> idk it's just a very negative string of events and i'm just a moody bitch now smh
[22:59:52] <TsundereNoises> mostly because of Troi's mom
[23:00:23] <MootPoot> shits borked
[23:00:29] <Matt|home> there is one star trek episode i watched with my sister. she was like "you have to watch this"
[23:00:30] <MootPoot> rip popOS
[23:00:36] <Matt|home> it's either voyager or discovery
[23:00:39] <Satin> MootPoot: how

[23:00:42] <Bco1981> MootPoot: don't pop the OS
[23:00:51] <Matt|home> worst written episode of any television show in the history of television. that is not an exaggeration

[23:00:54] <Satin> TsundereNoises: :=:
[23:00:59] <Satin> MootPoot: how
[23:01:09] <TsundereNoises> Matt|home: I think Voyager is the dumbest, writing-wise, but their dumb episodes don't cause me as much physical pain as the worst of TNG
[23:01:20] <Matt|home> it starts off with an experiment: seeing what happens when you go like, warp speed 10 or whatever. then the episode ends with lizard babies fucking. my god
[23:01:24] <Matt|home> you have no idea how bad that episode was

[23:02:07] <Matt|home> and i was screaming into the tiles on the floor because i couldn't take it
[23:02:08] <TsundereNoises> it's really fucking stupid, but it isn't quite as cringey as some, you know?

[23:03:31] <TsundereNoises> Matt|home: I was watching Travelers, newer SF show with a lot of the same crew as SG-1 (including one of the main writers/directors), it's more modern and I definitely think is pretty decent, but there are still a few really dumb moments
[23:04:36] <Matt|home> yeah. i haven't seen a truly amazing hard science fiction show, the closest one would be deep space 9, but it still has dumb moments. the best fake documentary movie sci fi .. movie.. i've seen is called europa report. if you could make a SHOW like that, it would be my all time favorite
[23:04:42] <TsundereNoises> Matt|home: I feel like the Nox make perfect sense though. They aren't helpful but why should they be, Nox don't give a fuck
[23:04:52] <Matt|home> ugh
[23:04:55] <Matt|home> i hate them with a passion

[23:05:26] <TsundereNoises> I loved Europa Report, but it's an idea that has about 2 hours worth of story in it I think
[23:05:33] <TsundereNoises> i.e. good for a movie
[23:05:40] <TsundereNoises> likewise Arrival is a great movie
[23:05:44] <TsundereNoises> but wouldn't make a good show
[23:06:48] *** Joins: aHick (~memes@71.219.219.100)
[23:09:24] <MootPoot> seems like they spend all their time in sci fi just making the set
[23:09:29] <MootPoot> and not spending time on the story
[23:10:18] <TsundereNoises> those two things have nothing to do with each other
[23:10:28] <TsundereNoises> never heard of an SF show where the writers built the sets

[23:10:54] <TsundereNoises> also reusing the same section of corridor for everything is a tradition as old as tv
[23:11:12] <TsundereNoises> run through the corridor set, run through the same set at another angle, cut it together
[23:11:43] <MootPoot> no, its just likre
[23:11:51] <MootPoot> from a outsiders perspective
[23:11:59] <MootPoot> trailers, demos , etc
[23:12:10] <MootPoot> its all about "cool blinky lights"
[23:12:55] <MootPoot> when's the last time you saw a sci fi trailer which wasent just random animations of futurisitc stuff and meaningless phrases

[23:14:47] <TsundereNoises> I don't know, I never watch trailers unless they're before movies I see in a theater
[23:15:04] <TsundereNoises> and I've seen like 3 movies in a theater in the last 2 years
[23:15:24] <TsundereNoises> trailers in general (sf or otherwise) are so often spoilery, or if not completely misleading
[23:16:01] <TsundereNoises> it pisses me off to no end when a trailer mis-advertises a movie: people who want what the trailer is advertising are disappointed, people who would like it don't see it because they think it's something else
[23:16:15] <TsundereNoises> so the only people happy are people who like what it was advertising and coincidentally also like what the movie actually was
[23:16:36] <TsundereNoises> I feel like A24 is guilty of that quite a bit
[23:20:33] <emmeka> I feel like most movie trailers are either bad, wrong, or spoil the whole thing

[23:33:32] <TsundereNoises> Sxem: with older movies sometimes it's fun to watch the trailer after the movie
[23:33:41] <TsundereNoises> but that's more for how weird some old trailers are
[23:34:23] <S_T_A_N> Nic Cage in Nic Cage the movie the movie
[23:35:58] <Poeticode> i remember the soylent green trailer spoils the entire movie lmao
[23:39:00] <TsundereNoises> not really a trailer, but there was a horror movie from the 70s that had a "test" before it to see if you were mentally stable enough to see the film
[23:39:27] <TsundereNoises> which I guess was a nice gimmick
[23:39:31] <TsundereNoises> although the movie was pretty tame
[23:40:39] <TsundereNoises> but yeah, I don't get why you'd always watch the trailer if you could avoid it, that's why trusted recomendations are so helpful
[23:40:50] <TsundereNoises> if you trust someone's opinion enough, you can go in with just the title
[23:41:27] <TsundereNoises> I try to do the minimal amount of research needed to know if I want to see a movie or not, trailer is like the last step if I'm still on the fence

[23:50:31] <Sxem> my mind can lose focus during movies, and i lose track of what the movie is about and who the main characters are, but the trailer helps me get my bearings
[23:51:28] <Sxem> i usually watch the trailer once to decide whether to dl it, and i do try to avoid watching too much  trailer then, so its more fresh later
[23:51:43] <Sxem> otherwise i might think ive already seen it
