[00:05:13] <Xliff> General question: Given that trait mods are implemented as multi subs, is there any way to make a trait_mod that can work using an objects attributes?
[00:06:46] <timo> hm, trait mods usually run at compile time, so often you dont have like attributes of objects since instantiation often happens later
[00:07:23] <timo> on the other hand, many cases of trait mods mix something into a type so that it can do its work at run time when that data actually is around
[00:08:50] <timo> the answer here really is +it depends+ 
[00:08:59] <timo> now where on this keyboard do i find quotes

[21:51:34] <vrurg> tonyo: it doesn't event have a name in latin alphabet. ЯМБ :D 
[21:53:09] <vrurg> Can be translated as A Language Of Accountant Machines
[21:56:01] <[Coke]> regarding jnthn's note about the spec test suite incidentally using features because they're convenient - might be nice to have a pass through the spec test suite to disentangle that sort of thing. (e.g don't use whatever-* if not needed)
[21:56:32] <lizmat> slightly -- on that: tests need to be easy to make
[21:56:41] <lizmat> this kind of refactoring is *fortunately* rare!
[22:01:07] <MasterDuke> that refactoring (of tests) might be easier to do in some sort of automated fashion after rakuast lands...
[22:03:53] <nine> Honestly sounds rather like useless busy work to me.

[22:12:08] <[Coke]> it's useless for rakudo, mostly; might be helpful for a new implementation
[22:12:29] <lizmat> jnthn surprises me  :-)
[22:12:38] <[Coke]> for $dayjob, sort of thing I'd put on the backlog but not prioritize until a business owner wanted to "pay" for it.
[22:12:53] <[Coke]> I'm behind, no spoilers!
[22:13:00] <[Coke]> (kidding, spoilers ok. :)
[22:13:30] <lizmat> an example of a custom compiler pass

[23:05:57] <nine> tonyo: follow up on auth checking: so if fez does the auth checking but at the same time I can still upload to CPAN or GitHub using someone else's name in my META6.json, what do we really gain? Sounds like it would only really work when we migrate everything to fez and abandon the other ecosystems.
[23:06:31] <lizmat> well, that would be a good course of action, IMO

[23:19:42] <japhb> I concur.  The only reason I haven't pushed for it is that the native fez support for mi6 wasn't merged last time I checked, and telling people to move away from CPAN when their tooling tries to push them onto CPAN seems destined for LTA.
[23:20:13] <japhb> (And I have only recently managed to get out from under a pile of unshaved yaks of my own.)

[23:49:14] <ugexe> nine: thats more a matter of what the default zef configuration is
[23:49:41] <ugexe> p6c and cpan can very well default to off and be turned on only with e.g. --cpan once some critical mass occurs
[23:50:20] <ugexe> although that i guess that mostly requires adbandoning the other ecosystems
