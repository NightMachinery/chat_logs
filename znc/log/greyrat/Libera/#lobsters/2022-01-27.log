[01:30:07] <JordiGH> I think taco trucks are technically illegal here or some shit.
[01:30:36] <JordiGH> Soooo, for the longest time Montreal forbade street food because the government thought it was too peasant or something to be eating on the street instead of a proper sit-down restaurant.
[01:30:53] <JordiGH> Seriously, that was the argument. About how it was kind of ugly to eat on the street.
[01:31:11] <JordiGH> So finally they said, okay, fine, you guys can have your street food... BUT IT HAS TO BE PROPER STREET FOOD
[01:31:44] <JordiGH> So now we have food trucks that are basically restaurants being allowed to take their exact same food with the same standards as at a sit-down restaurant... and sell it out of a truck.
[01:32:10] <JordiGH> (btw this was all in the before times, I'm sure covid has killed food trucks or whatever)
[01:32:32] <JordiGH> Tacos aren't fancy enough for the street food that's allowed here is my belief.

[01:39:14] <JordiGH> I was trying Skip The Dishes but they outright took my money and never gave me food so I had to go to my credit card to dispute the charge.
[01:39:51] <iDrougge> I live in a city so that I don't have to have food delivered to my door.
[01:39:51] <JordiGH> And there was no on one to complain to. They had some Zendesk thing to some confused kid half around the world who didn't give a crap about me.

[12:34:10] <riv> i dont get why you can refer to blobs outside of a repo
[12:34:24] <riv> it doesn't really make sense.. when you git clone you don't download forks
[12:34:39] <riv> so why does the web UI support this - they must have specially implemented it
[12:34:57] <jle> yeah, rellay easy to make fake "installation guides" and link them from somewhere
[12:38:22] <aram> a github fork is just a git branch internally.

[12:41:00] <riv> aram but why doesn't git clone take it?
[12:43:09] <albertito> riv: because git clone has a somewhat smart protocol, and doesn't get objects that are not referenced from the repository heads
[12:43:41] <aram> yep.
[12:43:43] <albertito> riv: that url thing is a github artifact, nothing to do with how git works. They probably have a blob database and don't want to cross-reference it with the repositories the object exits in, or something. Maybe a performance optimization
[12:44:24] <riv> oh right
[12:44:28] <riv> deduplication perhaps
[12:44:54] <albertito> riv: yeah, exactly. They probably share blobs between repos, because forking is common. You can also do that with plain git on your local filesystem, btw

[16:33:43] <riv> hm
[16:34:11] <riv> opinion poll:  trivial formatting changes should be in their own commit? separate from bug fixes, anything that changes functionality?
[16:34:26] <riv> personally I think they should, but maybe im overlooking something
[16:35:24] <bkhl> I generally only clean up in whatever blocks I'm committing. Wouldn't do "reformatting" commits other than to apply a new formatter/linter or something.
[16:36:01] <bkhl> But the latter wouldn't be trivial.
[16:38:59] <riv> I guess it is natural to do it that way
[16:39:12] <riv> but then someones reading commits has to skim past all these trivial changes to find the meat

[16:46:37] <pe> If it's a nontrivial formatting change, I'd make a separate commit.
[16:47:03] <pe> Or fix ups, anyway.
[16:49:44] *** Joins: macswagger (~cee@cpe-104-34-48-156.socal.res.rr.com)
[16:49:48] <bkhl> Depends on workflow I guess. Doing a single merge with a formatting fix before your actual fix seems fine.
[16:50:27] <bkhl> At my job we have put a ticket number at the start of every commit message, but can put "MINOR" for things like this.
[16:50:54] <riv> Thanks :)
[16:51:07] <bkhl> So sometimes I've done one of those commits in the same merge request, before the thing with the real changes. But that's for non-trivial things, like running the whole file through a formatter or something.
[16:51:23] <pe> Reformatting can also have a ticket number...
[16:53:06] <wink> reformatting with huge changes in one commit is horriblke
[16:53:29] <bkhl> Though if it's only white space changes it might be moot.
[16:53:33] <wink> but if you're working in a 5-line function that someone lookign at your change would have to read anyway...
[16:53:47] <bkhl> You can generally choose to view non-whitespace changes in a diff.
[16:53:55] <wink> bkhl: for visual inspection yes, btu it still breaks git blame
[16:54:17] *** Quits: macswagger (~cee@cpe-104-34-48-156.socal.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[16:54:21] <bkhl> wink, that's overblown I think. It's easy enough to go do blame on the commit before whatever the reformatting thing was.
[16:54:32] <wink> kinda annoying to look when something was changed and then there's 3 whiotespace commits in the last 3 years and the real commit is 5y old
[16:54:50] <gwozniak> yeah, I'm not tied to 'blame' either.  Digging a little deeper is fine by me
[16:55:17] <wink> it tends to not be a problem in current projects - it's mostly in legacy code before people looked at formatters or had coding styles at all
[16:55:24] <wink> it easily doubles the effort every time
[16:55:27] <bkhl> wink, if you do major reformattings there's also tools to exclude them from git blame.
[16:55:34] <gwozniak> yeah
[16:55:40] <wink> in a perfect world :)
[16:55:57] <bkhl> Anyway, depends on the project I guess.
[16:56:03] <wink> I'm not tellng you to not clean up, but then standalone cleanup is mandatory
[16:56:05] <bkhl> I maybe do git blame once every one or two weeks.
[16:56:11] <bkhl> And usually I don't run into this.
[16:56:37] <gwozniak> Ours isn't accurate anyway since we don't have the full history
[16:56:47] <wink> I have a 12y old project here where no one ever configured their ide correctly
[16:56:56] <bkhl> Ours isn't because someone (before my time in the team) screwed up the migration from Bazaar.
[16:57:21] <bkhl> So all commit messages going back a certain point have commit messages off by one from each commit. :-)
[16:57:52] <pe> Ouch.
[16:58:05] <bkhl> Will see when we get around to fixing this, but it's a bit of a pain as changing the messages would screw up lots of references to commits from the CI system logs.
[16:58:25] <bkhl> Thinking of redoing the migration and making it a double-root repo.
[16:58:44] <bkhl> So you have one root with correct messages, and a "legacy" one so you can still find stuff from the CI system.
[16:59:11] <pe> Wouldn't it be better to just break it...
[16:59:33] <pe> Though that may also be painful.
[16:59:40] <pe> When you refer to commits in commit messages.
[17:00:17] <pe> Or source code.

[21:04:05] <JordiGH> iDrougge: What does "rebase your formatting changes" mean?
[21:04:17] <JordiGH> I kind of don't know what people mean when they say rebase.
[21:04:23] <JordiGH> Do they mean `git rebase -i`?
[21:04:29] <JordiGH> Or do they mean "change the base"?
[21:04:51] <iDrougge> Rebase from the first commit, and change the commit where the problematic formatting was introduced, then continue the rebase.
[21:04:59] <iDrougge> Afterwards, just force push.
[21:05:42] <companion_cube> do you use `e` on these, iDrougge?
[21:05:54] <companion_cube> apply format, `git add`, `git rebase --continue`?
[21:06:01] <iDrougge> That's what I would do if I did it.
[21:06:24] <companion_cube> cool.
[21:06:50] <iDrougge> But it wouldn't work for anything with more than a handful maintainers.

[21:07:57] <companion_cube> I'm sure there's a way to automate this with filter-branch
[21:08:03] <companion_cube> to multiply the curse levels by 100
[21:08:07] <therufuser> iDrougge: k, sry - didn't get that it was a joke
[21:08:14] <daegalus> I will say that's tricky sometimes as VSCode tends to auto format on save and not formatting on save is a bit of a pita to remember and do
[21:08:18] <iDrougge> I think that there is a Python tool for this.
[21:08:23] <therufuser> I do it for feature-branches
[21:08:54] <iDrougge> Everyone does, right?
[21:08:57] <technomancy> daegalus: oof I hate it when I have to review patches from people who have that on
[21:09:00] <therufuser> And you can do `git rebase --exec $formatter` if you're feeling adventurous
[21:09:21] <daegalus> I try to rebase any formatting changes as either the first or last commit so that it's easy to review the range before ro after the commit
[21:09:22] <iDrougge> therufuser: That's ingenious.
[21:09:38] <technomancy> altho tbh that's just a bug in github that you can't set ?w=1 as a default when reviewing
[21:10:00] <therufuser> iDrougge: Are you joking again?
[21:10:36] <iDrougge> I don't know; isn't it ingenious in a special way?
[21:11:11] <iDrougge> If it's an inhouse project, I don't really see a problem with it if the formatter itself works correctly.
[21:11:34] <therufuser> I don't know; If it's something you need, sure. I just wanted to share a trick I picked up recently

[22:26:25] <wink> I disagree
[22:26:45] <wink> because it's not fragmented. better a slower adoption with less clients (more would be nice) than not 2 things compatible
[22:27:26] <technomancy> it's hard to get mad about something that causes fewer people to use slack/discord
[22:27:42] <thardin> you literally only need to brand an amalgamation of xmpp clients and a server to get that
[22:27:49] <technomancy> thardin: so do it
[22:27:55] <technomancy> if it's so easy
[22:27:56] <thardin> it's already being done with snikket
[22:28:02] <technomancy> never heard of it
[22:28:04] <thardin> it Just Works
[22:28:29] <thardin> prosody on the server, rebranded Conversations on the client
[22:29:01] <thardin> not sure if they branded any desktop client, but Gajim works well enough
[22:32:10] <technomancy> well, if snikket gets people to stop using slack/discord then I'm in favor of that too
[22:32:13] <cb> gajim was Not Great last time i used it
[22:32:31] <cb> conversations is basically the only ok xmpp client that supports a modern xmpp featureset
[22:32:33] <technomancy> I won't like, actually use it, but I will offer my moral support
[22:33:16] <cb> on windows gajim went from bad to awful, god only knows how it is on mac
[22:33:35] <cb> and i switched to iOS so i don't even know what's a good XMPP client. all my XMPP contacts stopped using it anyways
[22:34:52] <ngoldbaum> xmpp? what is this 2006?
[22:35:40] <cb> i'm matrix curious but matrix is perpetually on the verge of being good, not actually any good
[22:36:05] * ngoldbaum waits for the snow to stop to shovel
[22:36:12] <cb> last time a group i know tried to stand up matrix we just switched back to telegram
[22:36:30] * companion_cube is just waiting for a good weechat plugin
[22:36:44] <cb> i use irssi in tmux for irc (all ~85 buffers worth)
[22:36:59] <technomancy> companion_cube: I used one a while back that seemed good except for not having E2EE; is that what you mean?
[22:37:06] <cb> but i don't like it, but switching to another irc experience is just less meaningfuOClly bad
[22:37:13] <technomancy> "what's the best matrix client?" "Libera"
[22:37:21] <technomancy> it works both ways
[22:37:54] <cb> well, less meaningfully bad but not much of an improvement to merit switching
[22:39:22] <bkhl> I used Matrix for IRC for a while, and hung in some other channels too then.
[22:39:46] <bkhl> But found the only high quality channels I was in are the ones that are bridged here anyway.
