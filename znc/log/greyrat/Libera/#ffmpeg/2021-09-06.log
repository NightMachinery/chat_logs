[17:00:54] <phk> BtbN, im talking about showvolume's opacity, i have set opacity p=0.5 there
[17:01:12] <BtbN> You mean you want the output video to be transparent?

[17:02:44] <BtbN> overlay_cuda supports transparency of the overlaid input just fine. Needs to be in a format with transparency for that though, obviously
[17:03:15] <BtbN> You're explicitly telling it to convert it to yuv420p, stripping away the alpha channel

[21:40:58] <BenMcLean> Hello. I am looking at this page here https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/AudioChannelManipulation and trying to work out what would be the command to take a 4.0 (quadrophonic) FLAC file and map it to a 6 channel (5.1) file with the center channel and subwoofer silent
[21:58:07] <furq> BenMcLean: -af "pan=5.1|FL=FL|FR=FR|BL=BL|BR=BR"
[22:23:02] <BenMcLean> Thanks furq! I'll give that a try! :D
[22:23:19] *** Joins: Buster_ (~Buster@46.160.36.66)
[22:24:06] <BenMcLean> furq, I am wondering whether this would be a lossy conversion though? Can it just copy the streams or will it be re-encoding?
[22:24:56] <JEEB> that reminds me at some point I need to adjust the AAC etc stuff to the 2013 edition of the spec
[22:24:59] *** Quits: MrZeus__ (~MrZeus@141.98.252.252) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[22:25:22] <JEEB> since in 2013 they suddenly decided that "no, we didn't mean 'back channel' with our 5.1 definition"
[22:25:26] *** Quits: noarb (~noarb@user/noarb) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[22:25:53] <JEEB> 7.1 got a proper 7.1(back) thing, but 5.1(back) seems to mostly have been a mistake (albeit one that was actually spelled in the spec)
[22:26:25] *** Joins: noarb (~noarb@user/noarb)
[22:26:35] <JEEB> https://0x0.st/-cCn.png
[22:26:52] <JEEB> note the sudden disappearance of the word "rear" from the 5.1 definition
[22:28:02] <furq> BenMcLean: there's probably not a way to do that losslessly
[22:28:18] <JEEB> well as long as he's not doing any resampling from the FLAC?
[22:28:26] <furq> oh it's flac
[22:28:27] <furq> in that case yeah
[22:28:34] <furq> that's just a straight channel map
[22:28:46] <furq> [Parsed_pan_0 @ 0x5d94100] Pure channel mapping detected: 0 1 M M 2 3
[22:29:24] <BenMcLean> great thanks

[22:29:37] <furq> i don't see a way to make mute channels with -af channelmap but this does the same thing
[22:30:17] <JEEB> but yea, furq - just remember that there technically in FFmpeg is 5.1(side) and 5.1(back). I think "5.1" maps to the back one technically
[22:30:25] <JEEB> 5.1(side) is the AC-3 etc one
[22:30:34] <furq> right
[22:30:37] <JEEB> (and which AAC etc should be updated to)
[22:30:55] <BenMcLean> so ... are you saying his recommendation was incorrect JEEB?
[22:31:00] <furq> if you need side then SL=BL|SR=BR
[22:31:18] <JEEB> BenMcLean: It's Complicated
[22:31:45] <furq> if you're going to flac then regular 5.1 is fine
[22:32:08] <BenMcLean> I'm trying to go from quadrophonic FLAC to regular 5.1 yes
[22:32:33] <JEEB> I think the funny bit is that as long as you're not doing actual remixing if the channel order ends up being the same then even if the decoding entity mis-interprets it you can still get away with it
[22:32:41] <BenMcLean> mostly because Kodi doesn't play quadrophonic streams correctly on my nVidia Shield. It only plays the two front channels unless it sees all six channels present. stupid thing.
[22:33:01] <JEEB> I have a few movies with 3.1
[22:33:09] <JEEB> guess how many things interpret that as 4.0
[22:33:50] <BenMcLean> Yeah that's a mess. I was real disappointed that this SACD I saw of Leroy Anderson wasn't surround: it was 3 channel. 3 channel!? What is the point of that? Why not just make it stereo in that case?
[22:34:07] <BenMcLean> It's not like it was left and right and subwoofer either. It was left and right and center.
[22:34:33] <BenMcLean> So .... basically stereo, except dumb
[22:35:36] <BenMcLean> (this is different from the quadrophonic stuff I'm trying to convert)

[22:51:53] <emcodem> good evening ladies and gentlemen :-)
[22:52:33] <emcodem> i'd like to influence the h264 metadata log2_max_pic_order_cnt_lsb_minus4 in the sequence parameter set...
[22:52:56] <emcodem> it seems to depend on sps->poc_type
[22:53:12] <emcodem> but i wasnt able to find out what exactly could influence this sps poc_type...
[22:53:15] <emcodem> any clues ? :D
[22:53:22] * JEEB points at ITU-T H.264
[22:53:27] <JEEB> it's a free spec
[22:53:47] <emcodem> hmmm actually i didnt try it... lemme seek
[22:53:50] <emcodem> see
[22:53:58] <JEEB> although if you have a specific encoder in mind, you could just dig into its source
[22:54:05] <JEEB> if it's a hardware encoder, AHAHAHAHAHAHA (sorry)
[22:54:09] <emcodem> hehe
[22:54:22] <emcodem> i'd be happy to find it in any encoder but its really hard to find
[22:54:45] <JEEB> it's internals
[22:54:59] <JEEB> so you'd have to actually look into x264 code for x264 to see what effects it
[22:55:13] <JEEB> but I do usually see actually understanding what that value means as useful
[22:55:14] <emcodem> yeah... i hoped someone here has a feeling what parameters actually influence this, could be some gop structural thing
[22:55:16] <JEEB> before you start hacking stuff
[22:55:26] <JEEB> for which > spec
[22:55:45] <emcodem> i dont think i need to code for this, i believe it's a configuration thing only
[22:56:01] <emcodem> i mean it will react on gop config or something like it
[22:56:18] <JEEB> yes, the worst case scenario is just that someone like you starts hacking at the code :P
[22:56:34] <emcodem> 😝
[22:56:35] <JEEB> thus first, try to grasp what that value is. then go look at f.ex. x264 code to see what affects it

[23:02:18] <emcodem> too late for regrets 😂
[23:03:40] <emcodem> digging in the x264 source code did directly lead to success... damned, 2 hours digging in ffmpeg source for nothing :-(
[23:03:52] <emcodem> well at least i have again a little more insight at least :D
[23:03:57] <JEEB> well yea, the FFmpeg side only decodes after all
[23:04:07] <JEEB> x264 is the one that actually generates that stuff
[23:07:14] <emcodem> yeah i hoped that it's the same for all other encoders but i wasnt really able to see which of the h264* files are used from which component...

[23:07:55] <JEEB> stuff like that is just left to the encoder at hand, so for any hardware thing you're just left wondering WTF it does, or poking it with a stick :P
[23:08:43] <emcodem> poke it with a stick 🤣
[23:11:43] <BenMcLean> furq, oh no, the command you advised is only copying the front two channels (i checked by opening in audacity)
[23:14:41] <BenMcLean> Ah but I think I have figured it out. It is -af "pan=5.1|FL=FL|FR=FR|BL=SL|BR=SR"
