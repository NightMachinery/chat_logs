[00:00:04] <Rashad> (curiously enough, the "concept of a concept" is object oriented programming's syntax rules for writing a class)
[00:01:15] <Rashad> All concepts have the property of defining properties, and that is their common property, while omitting their specific values. (which also applies to this very concept)
[00:01:58] <Rashad> So one can write: class Class { List<Type, Name> properties; }
[00:02:14] <Rashad> This class describes all classes, including itself.
[00:03:22] <Rashad> An OOP compiler will not allow a property in a class to have a value, but it will allow a class without any values. If that compiler was to adhere fully to Ayn Rand's theory, it would have to also not allow for the empty class.
[00:04:29] <Rashad> The question now is how to integrate concepts non-conceptually.
[00:05:15] <Rashad> To rotate concepts in conceptual space without finding them different, in the same way that rotating an ice cube in the perceptual space does not make it different.

[00:06:50] <Rashad> One has to perhaps stretch and squeeze "List<Type, Name> properties;" In the same way one stretches and squeezes temperature to get ice or a cloud.
[00:07:36] <Rashad> For that to be possible with temperature, you have to define a unit and then a measurement system to get different values. I.e., 10 C or 23 F.
[00:07:45] <Rashad> measurement or numerical system*
[00:08:08] <Rashad> This should allow for half properties and quarter properties.
[00:08:20] <Rashad> I think that's it... you just have to define that!
[00:09:30] <Rashad> Not half a charge in the sense x/2 but in the sense that charge/2 = mass
[00:09:33] <Rashad> The property itself

[02:57:09] <tomathy> i want a discussion/debate of whether the "AI Takeover" or "Singularity" is a real danger, or whether it is just a modern cult with little basis in reality
[02:57:31] <tomathy> there have been so many movies about it
[02:57:42] <tomathy> and movies are somewhat predictive and prophetic
[02:58:27] <tomathy> but i find it very hard to believe that a created intelligence can defeat or come anywhere near to competing with a self-made intelligence that's evolved over millions of years
[02:58:49] <tomathy> and whether it can even have a will to exist
[02:59:10] <tomathy> the question is of course, does it need the will to exist? perhaps OUR will is for it to exist? and this is another route toward life?
[03:00:08] <tomathy> but it seems like idolatry to me, the worship of images and icons, just in modern form
[03:00:31] <tomathy> and idolatry is inherently anti-human, not by its nature since an idol is just dead, but by the intent of its adherents
[03:00:54] <tomathy> AI is in fact an idol and false God of modernity
[03:01:05] <tomathy> thoughts?
[03:01:45] <tomathy> right now companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, they float around in existence because they are powered by AI
[03:02:17] <tomathy> the less humans needed to power that AI, the more money they can make. So this idea has legitimacy only if there is a point whether 0 humans are needed to sustain the existence of the AI

[19:01:49] <DPA> It is interesting how "human" and "animal" refer to a physical thing, but "dehumanization", being human, and calling people animals, relate to the nature or behavior or actions of people or how they are viewed by society.
[19:01:50] <DPA> I kind of don't like that those terms have this kind of double meaning and conflate the two unrelated things with each other. It implies things like that an animal can not be human, although that may not be the case.
[19:04:55] <DPA> Or to put it another way, those words tie how something looks directly to prejudices about how they are.
[19:07:24] <DPA> Although, most humans and animals behave to a large extent the way expected of them, so it's not a big problem yet.

[19:24:51] <pussipupu> Some animals are human given all humans are animals(in the biological sense)
[19:25:32] <pussipupu> Though there are socially constructed meanings of "human" which don't map to the biological of course anyway
