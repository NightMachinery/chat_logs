[20:27:15] <Tiriftoj> Hello! Is there a nice way to delegate all methods which haven’t been overridden locally in a class to another object? The closest I got was ‘has $.object handles *’, but the Whatever also stands for any inherited methods, which I would like to exclude from the dispatch.
[20:28:36] <guifa> sounds like the job for a trait 
[20:31:40] <[Coke]> kind of like FALLBACK?
[20:31:56] <[Coke]> you could have a FALLBACK that re-dispatched to the handler.
[20:32:17] <Tiriftoj> guifa: Any trait in particular? :o
[20:33:41] <guifa> Tiriftoj: it'd be a custom one.  Basically though, question one would be creating a list of the methods you want redispatched.  Then you'd make a trait that adds a fallback (or even installs local methods) that redispatch to some object (which you might define via an attribute)
[20:34:49] <Tiriftoj> [Coke]: Oh right, I can use a HyperWhatever for that. I’ll see if that takes precedence…!

[21:00:26] <guifa> ugexe++  I didn't realize handles would take a class that way
[21:01:15] <guifa> And here I was trying to do that with a trait ha (although TIL there's a huge difference in saying class Foo is traitbar { … } and class Foo { …; also is traitbar } )
[21:01:40] <guifa> Is there any way to, uh, put a trait on a trait so it's done later rather than sooner?
[21:02:25] <Tiriftoj> [Coke]: Okay, so it looks like inheritance takes priority over FALLBACK for ‘handles’… or at least this didn’t work for me:
[21:02:31] <Tiriftoj> m: class A { method m { say “A!” } }; class B { method m { say “B!” } }; class Z is A { has $.b handles ** = B.new(); method FALLBACK ($name, *@args) { say “Z!” } }; Z.new.m;

[21:08:38] <Tiriftoj> Inherited methods are also preferred to delegation by explicit classes, it seems:

[21:36:38] <ph88> can rakudo be run as a single binary or does it need a bunch of files ?
[21:46:07] <guifa> Not by default.  I'm sure there's a way to compile into a single one, but I'm not good with that type of stuff.  I'm sure someone experienced in C could figure it out though
[21:47:24] <El_Che> ph88: it works like perl, python or ruby
[21:47:30] <sjn> ph88: rakudo requires a bunch of files; at minimum the program and the raku VM and it's support libraries. I'm pretty sure noone has tried making something that produces a single executable file...
[21:48:11] <El_Che> sjn: there was an summer of code intern that got pretty far iirc
[21:49:11] <sjn> strace ./raku -e '1' 2>&1 | grep open|wc -l

[21:50:41] <sjn> most are precompiled libraries

[21:52:22] <sjn> ph88: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEFVQaSgJ60 is a decent intro

[22:00:27] <sjn> Raku is still a small language, but growing. Perl has a much larger install base, so whatever you compare with, it'll pretty much have more users in any metric.
[22:02:03] <sjn> ph88: but if you look at the language, you'll see that it solves a *lot* of issues that other languages still struggle with, so when you're considering tools for new development, you'll do yourself quite the favor by considering Raku
