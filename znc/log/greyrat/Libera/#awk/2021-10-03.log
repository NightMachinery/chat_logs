[18:14:51] <Nintendo> Is anyone else disappointed by awk's inability to handle spaces and whatnot in paths?  It's a deal-breaker.
[18:15:28] <Nintendo> c = "sha256sum " ARGV[0]
[18:16:09] <Nintendo> s/0/1
[18:16:22] <Nintendo> It should be that simple.  It's not.
[18:21:17] <geirha> the problem is it doesn't have a way to execute commands. All it can do is use system() and popen() and they only accept a single string that will be passed to sh -c
[18:21:30] <geirha> so you have shell quote the variables you want to inject
[18:22:14] <jetchisel> That is where Perl comes in, at least during that time ^^
[18:22:55] <geirha> f = ARGV[1]; gsub(q, q"\\"q q, f); cmd = "sha256sum " q f q 
[18:23:01] <geirha> where q is  -v q=\'
[18:24:56] <geirha> # awk -v q=\' 'BEGIN{ f = ARGV[1]; gsub(q, q"\\"q q, f); cmd = "printf \"<%s>\\n\" " q f q; system(cmd); exit}' "argument with spaces and 'other stuff'"
[18:24:58] <shbot> geirha: <argument with spaces and 'other stuff'>
[18:26:26] <geirha> # awk -v q=\' 'BEGIN{ f = ARGV[1]; gsub(q, q"\\"q q, f); cmd = "touch " q f q; system(cmd); exit}' "argument with spaces and 'other stuff'"; ls -l
[18:26:27] <shbot> geirha: total 0
[18:26:27] <shbot> geirha: -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Oct  3 14:56 argument with spaces and 'other stuff'
[18:29:15] <geirha> Nintendo: ^
[18:30:34] <Nintendo> If a non-f portion of cmd contains an asterisk, does it not break?
[18:30:57] <Nintendo> Then again, that would probably be a malformed command in the first place...
[18:31:33] <Nintendo> This is starting to feel like a C program, hehe.
[18:31:59] <Nintendo> Thanks for the tip, geirha.  I will try it out.
[18:32:51] <Nintendo> I am a fool, so if it is not foolproof, I will likely find a way to break it ;)
[18:41:48] <Nintendo> # awk -v q=\' 'BEGIN{ f = ARGV[1]; gsub(q, q"\\"q q, f); cmd = "touch 'look at me' " q f q; system(cmd); exit}' "argument with spaces and 'other stuff'"; ls -l
[18:41:56] <shbot> Nintendo: awk: non-terminated string touch look... at source line 1
[18:41:56] <shbot> Nintendo:  context is
[18:41:56] <shbot> Nintendo: etc... ( http://ix.io/3AHG )
[18:43:16] <Nintendo> It is a contrived example, because the workaround is immediately obvious, but it demonstrates the point.
[18:44:12] <Nintendo> Awk would be so much better if it could handle "$f" like a shell does.

[18:55:58] <Patsie>  might still be missing the actual problem here. is it that you want to quote ARGV[1] ? or are you having some issue with creating some combined static+variable command, with spaces in the executed command ?
[18:58:14] <Nintendo> Originally, I just wanted to quote ARGV items.  geirha's solution solved that problem, but I had already whipped up a bash script in the meantime :(
