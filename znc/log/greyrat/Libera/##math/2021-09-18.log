[02:44:00] <droid3> For you familiar with differential algebra /differential Galois theory. Which an application if it is to determine when a function can be integrated interms of elementary functions.
[02:45:09] <droid3> My question is this in a differential field extension adjoining the generalized hypergeometric functions what functions would still be not elementary of this differential field???
[02:47:11] <droid3> It seems hypergeometric function can be used to express any major special function i can come across aka bessel , gamma , elliptic ,erf , trig , hyperbolic ,inv trig , inv hyperbolic , ...etc

[02:48:07] *** Joins: dispater (~dispater@user/brprice)
[02:48:30] <droid3> Hypergeometric functions/series are elementary over there base differential field because integrating hypergeometric functions gives another hypergeometric type function.
[02:48:43] <droid3> So its closed under integration as well.
[02:49:40] <droid3> So it be a differentially closed field extension adjoining hypergeometric functions. Provided all special functions are special cases of hypergeometric functions which in general i dont think is true ?
[02:50:13] <droid3> But i havent been able to find any counter examples of groups of special functions that cannt be written interms of hypergeometric functions????
[02:50:40] <droid3> Anybody understand the question or know the answer to this with a counterexample ?
[02:53:16] <droid3> Leaving differential algebra/galois theory for a second.
[02:53:55] <droid3> The other question which relates to this is...are there any class of special function that cannt be written interms of hypergeometric functions ????
[02:57:23] <droid3> Because if ever special function and any major set of functions can be represented as a hypergeometric functions/series wouldnt by gosper-zeilberger algorithm
[02:58:16] <droid3> allow us to derive almost any mathematical symbolic function /constant identities?
[02:58:54] <droid3> Sure in theory it seems but practice its exponential runtime or infinite runtime ...

[03:02:08] <droid3> Most constants and special function can be represented in hypergeometric function so what cannt other then distributions,piecewise function ...etc
[03:03:03] <droid3> Is there a more general special function that incorporates more constants and special functions then the hypergeometric type functions?
[03:04:11] <droid3> elliptic functions of the first and second kind can be expressed as hypergeometric functions.

[04:03:20] <[itchyjunk]> ##machinelearning recommends a few
[04:03:29] <[itchyjunk]> there is ##ai too which recommends more general stuff
[04:04:11] <[itchyjunk]> this is a common free book that's recommended
[04:04:12] <[itchyjunk]> http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/
[04:04:36] <[itchyjunk]> most books won't have "cutting edge" though. assuming you're looking for deep learning and not "machine learning"
[04:06:15] <Klinda> I just for now have some vision on what ai and machine lerning does, like nlp, computer vision etc
[04:06:31] <[itchyjunk]> machine learning by tom mitchell is a recommended book
[04:06:34] <Klinda> but I think math is the most important part to understand well
[04:06:34] <[itchyjunk]> but this is proper ML

[04:07:44] <Klinda> I mean svm, random forest etc
[04:07:51] <Klinda> these algorithms come from math
[04:09:26] <[itchyjunk]> well, if you wanna learn to cook a chicken, you could go learn chemistry first because chickens are ultimately made of chemicals
[04:09:47] <[itchyjunk]> but you can cook them without knowing much chemistry
[04:10:01] <[itchyjunk]> is you goal to come up with algos? make your own?
[04:10:56] <Klinda> I don't know, as a computer scientist I would prefer to have a degree on math than cs, cause hard topics (P, NP problems etc) come from math
[04:12:15] <[itchyjunk]> To make an apple pie from scratch,  you start with the universe.
[04:12:24] *** Joins: Macuser (~Macuser@216.30.159.201)
[04:12:26] <[itchyjunk]> But it might take a long time before you have some apple pie.
[04:12:47] <[itchyjunk]> If you plan to spend a good few decades before you get to your goal, math is probably the right approach
[04:12:49] <Klinda> seems like if you master math, you can do what you want :D
[04:13:32] <Klinda> yes but one thing is to write classifier(training data, labels)
[04:13:34] <BadK4rMa> if you are creating libraries stuff math would very useful. but if you are using libraries that have all the functions then you could get away w/ not knowing the math
[04:13:53] <Klinda> and then test it
[04:14:00] <Klinda> one thing is to know what's behind it
[04:14:18] <Klinda> so why one should prefer to use a classifier that another one? and so on
[04:14:25] <Klinda> than*
[04:14:57] <[itchyjunk]> Those aren't covered in math.
[04:15:09] <[itchyjunk]> Modern NN's don't have much mathematical theory behind them.
[04:15:22] <[itchyjunk]> You'll want to wait a 100 years or so before it's formalized in math.
[04:15:31] <Klinda> well I am a newbie so I don't know :D
[04:15:34] <cherim> ML is not equal to NN
[04:15:40] <[itchyjunk]> they just try different things till it works.
[04:16:00] <cherim> And by what Klinda says, I don't even see any NN focus
[04:16:05] <[itchyjunk]> right ML and NN is different. but they said modern NLP and such which is mostly NNs
[04:16:08] <[itchyjunk]> transformers and such
[04:16:11] <[itchyjunk]> like GPT-3
[04:16:28] <Klinda> yes I am intrested in NLP too
[04:16:32] <zacts> what about statistics?
[04:16:35] <Klinda> I know they use NN
[04:16:42] <[itchyjunk]> NN's aren't new
[04:16:49] <[itchyjunk]> DNN's are newer
[04:16:56] <[itchyjunk]> but the field is so vast
[04:17:20] <Klinda> statistics also it's important, there is the function for the probability predict_proba :D
[04:17:37] <[itchyjunk]> in any case, better get started
[04:17:41] <[itchyjunk]> you'll be at it for a while
[04:17:42] <Klinda> true
[04:17:56] <BadK4rMa> what are you trying to do klinda?
[04:18:02] <BadK4rMa> make an app?
[04:18:07] <[itchyjunk]> learn ML
[04:18:10] <BadK4rMa> i kinda butted in :)

[06:50:39] <somiaj> biberao: yes
[06:50:56] <somiaj> the classic example is work along a path though a vector field
[06:51:14] <somiaj> but you can also use them to figure out the length of a curve
[06:51:19] <biberao> i see
[06:52:11] <somiaj> at some level the classic riemann integral is a line integral along the x-axis where you weight things by 'area'
[06:52:28] <somiaj> you can also find the charge along a wire with a line integral using a charge density, or a mass using a mass density
[06:52:33] <biberao> in high school we stop at differential equations of type f'=kf
[06:52:55] <biberao> i found this https://math24.net/physical-applications-line-integrals.html
[06:53:27] <biberao> thanks somiaj
[06:53:40] *** Joins: thyriaen_ (~thyriaen@x4db78003.dyn.telefonica.de)
[06:54:13] <somiaj> depending on what you mean by line integral, you can basically view any 1D integral as a line integral, so even volumes of rotation can be viewed as line integrals moving down the axis of rotation.
[06:54:41] <biberao> ok need to analyse tomorrow

[14:24:17] <Gurkenglas> It seems that instead of defining categories as "A path of X induces one X" and then functors as "An X induces a Y such that all diagrams commute", I can define functors as "A path of X induces one Y" and then categories, if I ever need them, as a special functor. Is there a word for this approach?

[14:34:36] <riv> what's this about paths inducing?
[14:34:44] *** cherim_ is now known as cherim
[14:35:13] <Gurkenglas> A category lets you compose a path of arrows into one arrow. Associativity and unitality are both covered by "all ways to do this come out the same way".
[14:36:55] <riv> hmm
[14:37:46] <riv> so what does a path of X mean
[14:37:53] <Gurkenglas> to put it in context, this approach would define a function as "An X induces one Y"
[14:38:13] <riv> this just seems obtuse
[14:38:26] <riv> just call them morphisms
[14:38:27] <Gurkenglas> An arrow has a source and a target. A path of arrows is a finite sequence of arrows that has each target equal to the next source
[14:39:04] <Gurkenglas> https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/arrow
[14:39:21] <Gurkenglas> it's a morphism without there necessarily already being a notion of composition.
[14:39:42] <riv> seems like a weird thing to say
[14:40:15] <riv> morphisms come before composition in normal category theory
[14:41:05] <Gurkenglas> I mean, what to name em isn't the hill for me to die on :) sure we can call them morphisms.
[14:42:06] <riv> you were saying that calling them a path implies composition axioms
[14:42:34] <Gurkenglas> no i didnt
[14:43:16] <riv> ok
[14:43:57] <Gurkenglas> i see your interpretation now, though. a function is a witness of "for all X there exists a Y" and a functor is a witness of "for all paths of X there exists a Y".
[14:45:59] <Gurkenglas> calling them a path implies that sources and targets match. note that there is a canonical category of "paths of morphisms".

[21:46:23] <Hash> Given two positive numbers a and n, a modulo n (abbreviated as a mod n) is the remainder of the Euclidean division of a by n, where a is the dividend and n is the divisor.

[21:46:37] <Hash> I don't understand. I have never heard of this 'mod' thing my whole life and I did math
[21:46:48] <cherim> There are \pmod and \bmod
[21:47:14] <Hash> For example, the expression "5 mod 2" would evaluate to 1, because 5 divided by 2 has a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1
[21:47:23] <Z-module> I would gladly preferentially adopt "tau" if we could get rid of this ubiquitous confusion between equvalence mod m and a particular representative of the equivalence class.
[21:47:23] <Hash> while "9 mod 3" would evaluate to 0, because the division of 9 by 3 has a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 0
[21:47:28] <cherim> First is an equivalence relation as qergle gave
[21:47:34] <int-e> Hash: the usual notation in math is not an operation, it's a relation.  a = b (mod m) just means m | a-b, there are no remainders.
[21:47:37] <cherim> Second is a binary operation as Hash gave
[21:47:43] <cherim> It's just less common
[21:47:46] <Hash> Right
[21:48:14] <cherim> But if you bring ax+b(mod M), it's clearly a piece cut off from \pmod

[21:48:28] <Hash> It's the affine cipher

[21:59:54] <somiaj> Forlorn: your cancellation is not valid.
[21:59:57] <bunny87> i think you're forgetting that g can be not equal to e.
[22:00:01] <int-e> the notations are quite distinct. 2 = 17 mod 5 is the remainder operation, 17 ≡ 12 (mod 5) is modular equivalence; the extra parentheses are quite distinctive (so much so that we often write ≡ as =).
[22:00:09] <somiaj> since g != e you cannot cancle it
[22:00:17] <bunny87> that's it!
[22:00:25] <somiaj> Forlorn: it is kinda like saying 6*4 = 8*3 thus 6 = 8
[22:00:44] <Forlorn> Ah, I get it thanks

[22:03:46] <Z-module> It's never done and is extremely confusing.
[22:05:00] <Z-module> but yeah, you can have  a b = c d   in a group and this doesn't imp;lyu a = either of c or d, nor b = either of c or d
[22:05:46] <Z-module> but if you had  a b = c b   *then* you could cancel off the b from both sides
[22:05:55] <bunny87> well, let's just direct Forlorn in the right path. if anything, your cancellation should lead to the fact that g^(n-1) = g^-1

[22:08:36] <coeus> any word the search for Brian Laundrie?
[22:09:28] <Forlorn> Consider we have a group G and we can form the sequence 1,2,4,3, with application by •2 then 3•2 = 1
[22:09:31] <coeus> wrong channel, sorry
[22:09:31] <Forlorn> Proof by contradiction: if it was equal to any other element in this sequence, more precisely 3•2 = 1•2^m, where 0<m<4,
[22:09:34] <Forlorn> then since 3=1•2^3, that means, 2^3•2 = 2^4 = 2^m•2^n = 2^m where 0 < n < 4 (since we can do that rewrite). If this is true, it must mean that 2^n = 1. Contradiction. Hence we exhaust all options, and the only one remaining is the identity action, that is 2^4 = 1.

We know that -1 is the additive inverse of 1, so we have that 1 + (-1) = 0, then (I think I can do this) just multiply everything by (-1) so you get that (-1) (1) + (-1)(-1) = (-1) 0, so then it is (-1) + (-1)(-1) = 0 and so by adding 1 to both sides you get (-1)(-1) = 1
