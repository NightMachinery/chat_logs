[11:34:00] <SpaceVimBot> <15228328910> hi , i want to change spacevim bootstrap logo, how to do that ?
[12:20:19] <SpaceVimBot> <cefin:matrix.org> Hi, I have some issue with spacevim layers. I found Spacevim and i quiet like it, but indentLine and gitstatus don't work. Is it a known issue ?
[12:20:20] <SpaceVimBot> <cefin:matrix.org> I'm with a Debian computer, vim via terminal.
[12:20:21] <SpaceVimBot> <cefin:matrix.org> I put `enable_indentline` and `enable_filetree_status` on my init.toml but it don't work.

[14:09:54] <SpaceVimBot> <woss:matrix.org> cool, without the spacevim i would put that in the `vimrc` file. but now where to put that, `init.toml`? that doesn't seem to be a correct place. i could maybe put in the custom function? then again, any reason why that is not enabled by default?
[14:11:29] <SpaceVimBot> <christofsteel:k-fortytwo.de> I don't know, I just put it in my bootstrap function, but yeah I think this would make a good default.
[14:12:00] <SpaceVimBot> <woss:matrix.org> @wsdjeg: can it be done? ^^
