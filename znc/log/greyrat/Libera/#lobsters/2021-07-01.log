[00:11:41] <Ristovski> I can highly recommend Motorola devices. Probably the best for both stock-only experience, but also with great community support with custom ROMs etc
[00:11:53] <lep> dsc_, have you considered using mpd?
[00:12:47] <lep> it should be able to play youtube and has http output aswell
[00:12:49] <Ristovski> Fun fact: Moto phones come with a "sensor hub" which is used for their fancy "Moto Actions" (double flick for flashlight, twist for camera etc)
[00:12:54] <dsc_> lep: Yes, but I prefer liquidsoap due to its ability to auto-switch to a different stream when it detects one (i.e: /live.ogg starts via icecast2, liquidsoap detects it, switches to the livestream)
[00:12:56] <lep> but i dunno shit about icecast etc.
[00:13:12] <Ristovski> it runs a STM32 MCU which processes data from sensors and sends interrupts to the main ARM SoC :P
[00:13:19] <dsc_> icecast2 just multiplexes the audio stream, you'd need it with mpd too
[00:13:34] <lep> how so?

[02:47:05] <mockturtle> [ lobsters/lobsters ] - github.com
[02:48:00] <pushcx> Otherwise... we don't do too many db-specific things. MySQL is Right Out if you want the Replies feature to work because it lacks an optimization from MariaDB, but probably other SQL dbs would be fine or a reasonable amount of work.
[02:48:31] <hoistbypetard> if a psql move would come with a move to DO's managed postgres... i can't currently recommend that.
[02:48:59] <epilys> yeah with the easiness of not committing to anything right now, I could probably "maintain" a different db
[02:49:01] <hoistbypetard> the managed postgres has been a little slow for **much** less traffic than lobste.rs would see
[02:49:24] <pushcx> hoistbypetard: Thanks for the heads up, I really appreciate hearing that.
[02:50:28] <hoistbypetard> it is a real headscratcher how running a self-managed instance on what i presume are the same size droplets performs better
[02:51:02] <hoistbypetard> (this is an instance of my site, not lobste.rs, but mine is much simpler and has dozens of users.)
[02:51:04] <pushcx> epilys: I'd be happy to accept patches (esp tests, see issue 861) for db support that don't add a significant maintenance burden to running Lobsters (see readme/contributing for philosophy)

[02:52:14] <epilys> oof
[02:52:20] <pushcx> I was really underwhelmed with the support on the managed db, especially after my issue was escalated and I couldn't tell I wasn't still getting tier 1 canned responses.
[02:52:42] <epilys> pushcx, have you evaluated sqlite?

[02:57:23] <hoistbypetard> the ORM would give me heartburn moving to sqlite. I don't really ruby, but i've had bad experiences running things that seemed agnostic from sqlalchemy, diesel and tortoiseORM against sqlite. things that were just fine with postgres and maria.
[02:57:57] <hoistbypetard> so if i were setting up something that's new to me and had been mainly run on maria or postgres, i'd not start out trying to migrate it to sqlite :)

[14:08:58] <zeph_> Brekkjern: Yes, I plan to link my GitHub in my resume so they can come look at my slick profile picture and fluid pronouns. I guess I also would need to clone some stuff in Rust, though.
[14:09:05] <wink> zeph_: at least where I live (Germany) nobody cares for github profiles. maybe some hip berlin startup. I imagine most decent companies have "github profile" as one of n criteria. I always found it a nice bonus, but only with decent OSS contributions, just some projects might as well be empty
[14:09:17] <Brekkjern> Also, complaining about githubs dominance is kinda dumb when you have GitLab, Gitea, Bitbutcket and probably other systems that are similar.
[14:09:20] <zeph_> wink: What do they care about?
[14:09:53] <varjag> since it's germany, prolly your diplomas and grades
[14:09:54] <wink> zeph_: I have no idea, my sample size is also just 1, because I think I was bad at hiring people. Experience and being able to think
[14:10:09] <lep> i also put my github in my resumé but it wasnt mentioned in the interview

[14:12:21] <wink> varjag: some institutions require or strongly encourage it. to give some credibility. I was repeatedly told to put "Senior Developer" and not just "Developer", my wife (not in IT) was told to put her title there, maybe also for law reasons
[14:12:51] <wink> zeph_: in my experience, no. but if you look through the hiring threads on e.g. HN, some people say it is.

[14:14:11] <zeph_> I had a job some time ago and left without serving the notice period. That counts as no experience. That's why I thought I only have some portfolio and two degrees with piss poor grades to show.

[14:19:59] <epilys> zeph_, why?
[14:20:03] <epilys> have they asked?
[14:20:06] <wink> zeph_: sounds fine. if you want to be a developer then the grades should really be not important. my main advice would be to practice interviewing. just try as many as you can, maybe even the ones that only sound half-interesting. you might be lucky or, at least can practice interviewing and then learn from it.
[14:20:28] <zeph_> wink: What are the lowest salaries they offer in Europe?
[14:20:28] <iDrougge> zeph_: If you have some code that is relatively nice or interesting, by all means put it on Github. Doesn't have to be a project with releases or a readme, just code that shows me that you are a person who cares about code.
[14:20:59] <wink> zeph_: sounds fine re: degrees. No clue about the notice periods, but I think a single one shouldnt ring any alarm bells
[14:21:01] <EdwardIII> we're a small co and we love to see github profiles, but it's not a deal breaker as some people just don't have time to do side projects in the real world
[14:21:11] <EdwardIII> but it's definitely a huge plus
[14:21:27] <EdwardIII> well not strictly github profiles, just code that the person has written
[14:21:30] <wink> EdwardIII: my experience simply was that only like 5% had anything on there really
[14:21:50] <wink> and some clowns had a github profile with 3 cloned projects and zero own code
[14:21:50] <EdwardIII> we also have an extremely simple code practical
[14:21:54] <wink> not sure why that was mentioned
[14:22:03] <zeph_> wink: I develop some stuff here and there but it might not be the language they are looking for.
[14:22:08] <EdwardIII> wink: yes :) we can skim through as devs and figure out what's worth seeing or not
[14:22:45] <wink> zeph_: there are companies who insist on experience in their language and others who won't mind, if you show stuff in 2 languages you probably will learn a third..
[14:23:13] <zeph_> iDrougge: Thanks.
[14:23:23] <wink> EdwardIII: the problem with people with awesome github profiles and lots of OSS contributions tend to flock to companies with an open source project... :P

[14:25:07] <epilys> torvalds is more of a manager than developer nowadays anyway

[14:28:16] <varjag> if you want serious money as an individual contributor you go to sv
[14:28:18] <wink> zeph_: your thinking is flawed here. If you are a junior and the company actually accepts remote people and they pay their juniors 40k, then why not 40k? Some actually have a "you live in $expensive city, so you get more, etc.pp" - but no harm trying.
[14:28:19] <zeph_> iDrougge: It was not a bootcamp. So, that probably qualifies.
[14:28:37] <wink> zeph_: I think ther real problem is getting a remote job in Germany. We actually suck at everything digital.
[14:28:46] <iDrougge> zeph_: If you want 30 000 $, that is possible for a junior with no documented experience.

[14:31:11] <rtpg> I mean I think a lot of remote people are low-balling. If you have some skillsets and you were to say 30k that would largely hit people's budget (and quoting too low is actually a negative signal, like "wait if this person was good they would say more"
[14:31:18] <zeph_> EdwardIII: I don't care. Unemployed at 26, I would be awake at the nights.

[15:04:03] <iDrougge> I thought it was the other way around, with the USA having deindustrialised even earlier.

[16:14:04] <varjag> yup, question is how less well for the rest
[16:15:09] <iDrougge> Well, it's basically a blub copilot if you're working in a blub language.
[16:16:01] <iDrougge> So if you write a function to add one year to a date, it will write code to add 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 seconds to your date.

[16:16:44] <varjag> i think you give it too much and too little credit simultaneously
[16:17:21] <varjag> doing what you describe from first principles requires a naive, incorrect concept of time
[16:17:37] <varjag> but a concept of time none the less
[16:17:52] <varjag> but if it's merely a copycat it'll likely give you a better solution written by meat programmers many times before
[16:18:25] <iDrougge> Unfortunately, there is much code of that kind on Github on which it has been trained.

[23:25:31] <imode> rust requires a fucking else for every if?
[23:25:41] <imode> unless the expression reduces to unit?
[23:25:46] <imode> wow, fuck off.
[23:26:06] <technomancy> but like ... how could it not
[23:26:07] <aravk> that's wrong
[23:26:13] <aravk> oh wait
[23:26:26] <aravk> when the return type of the if expression isn't unit, then sure
[23:26:44] <aravk> and it makes sense - if you're returning something like a File from one branch, how do you expect it to generate a default for the else?
[23:27:05] <technomancy> implicit else only makes sense in languages that are poisoned by nil
[23:27:12] <aravk> ^
[23:27:21] <technomancy> even racket requires else
[23:27:23] <aravk> or where if is a statement, not an expression (à la C)
[23:27:34] <imode> and how is unit not equivalent to nil in this case, you could absolutely infer the absence of a branch to mean "unit".
[23:27:52] <aravk> imode: but unit and a complex type like File aren't compatible
[23:27:55] <technomancy> although if you're going to do it right you should probably just get rid of if altogether
[23:28:10] <imode> blech
[23:28:18] <technomancy> like erlang
[23:28:20] <aravk> in Rust, when you have a value of File, it guarantees that you have an actual file
[23:28:34] <aravk> you can't return unit as if it were a file because that breaks the guarantee
[23:28:36] <imode> sequencing sould not complect with expression semantics.
[23:28:40] <imode> *should
[23:28:49] <imode> have a separate keyword for an expression-if, jesus.
[23:29:00] <companion_cube> imode: rust is correct, yes
[23:29:03] <imode> the real thing that pissed me off was that beginners are going to encounter this and be like "oh that's fine".
[23:29:08] <companion_cube> it's fine
[23:29:11] <companion_cube> it's just expressions
[23:29:11] <imode> and the compiler will scream at 'em.
[23:29:19] <aravk> yeah, and then they'll understand why
[23:29:20] <companion_cube> there is no nil
[23:29:23] <imode> yeah but they LOOK like regular statements.
[23:29:23] <technomancy> if is just shitty pattern matching
[23:29:27] <aravk> because there's a logical reason for it
[23:29:30] <imode> technomancy: yeah.
[23:29:49] *** Quits: archie (~archie@host-82-51-18-227.retail.telecomitalia.it) (Quit: Client closed)
[23:29:52] <imode> there's no logical reason to have the same syntax for expressions as there is for statements in a language that clearly has a boundary between the two.
[23:30:02] <companion_cube> it barely has statements…
[23:30:04] <imode> and to have that carry over into you using either of them the wrong way.
[23:30:11] <companion_cube> there's like `let = …;` and that's it
[23:30:17] <imode> if statements.
[23:30:22] <companion_cube> not a statement
[23:30:26] <companion_cube> an expression
[23:30:40] <imode> fine, a subclass of these expressions that yield the unit type.
[23:30:43] <imode> joy.
[23:30:47] <imode> what a wonderful language.
[23:30:49] <aravk> imode: you're thinking in terms of imperative programming.  Rust's in a weird spot in between, IMO.
[23:30:50] <companion_cube> it is!
[23:31:04] <technomancy> treating statements as a separate thing from expressions is a noob language designer mistake
[23:31:05] <imode> aravk: incredibly weird. just write a lisp already.
[23:31:10] <companion_cube> +1 technomancy
[23:31:10] <imode> companion_cube: it is absolutely not lmao.
[23:31:18] <aravk> imode: too many parentheses
[23:31:19] <companion_cube> imode: maybe because you're not used to it
[23:31:28] <companion_cube> OCaml is the same and it's pretty awesome
[23:31:30] <imode> I'm used to every language feature known to man lmao.
[23:31:38] <companion_cube> clearly you're not used to expressions
[23:31:44] <aravk> lol
[23:31:45] <imode> bold of you to assume that.
[23:31:45] <technomancy> there's plenty of other legitimate criticisms of rust but this is one thing they got right
[23:31:59] <companion_cube> I'm not assuming, I'm just noticing
[23:32:04] <gerikson> I'm a Rust n00b, what does "unit" mean in this context
[23:32:14] <companion_cube> it's the type () with one value in it
[23:32:20] <technomancy> with the possible exception of the fact that their docs misleadingly claim that they have statements
[23:32:20] <imode> technomancy: it just doesn't jive with the rest of the syntax. if you're going to pass off "block-oriented" programming syntax to people, these things have not historically looked like expressions.
[23:32:21] <companion_cube> (also named () but well)
[23:32:45] <companion_cube> gerikson: in rust, all expressions return a value
[23:32:46] *** Quits: pyrorock (~Dont@37.222.8.156) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:32:50] <companion_cube> sometimes this value is `()`
[23:32:52] <imode> so when you get newcomers they're gonna complect a bunch of things, making the language harder to work in.
[23:32:53] <aravk> gerikson: Unit is a type which has a single value.  You use it when you're not really providing any informtion (e.g. when you're returning from a function which doesn't give back any value, you're actually returning unit).
[23:32:53] <technomancy> imode: not really true; ruby has no statements
[23:33:01] <imode> technomancy: ruby doesn't pretend to be C.
[23:33:02] <companion_cube> newcomers can learn
[23:33:11] <technomancy> it's still block-oriented and imperative
[23:33:19] <gerikson> thanks companion_cube and aravk
[23:33:20] <imode> it's more about syntax imo.
[23:33:26] <companion_cube> it's like whining about `var : type` instead of `type var`

[23:33:49] <technomancy> complaining that they didn't repeat the same mistakes of the past is like ... well, yeah that's the point

[23:34:47] <imode> oh god it's not.
[23:34:52] <technomancy> statements are always a design mistake, unless you redefine statements to mean "returns unit"
[23:34:54] <companion_cube> ^
[23:35:10] <af> Like just a simple web interface which has directory navigation, syntax highlighting and a search function which just execs ripgrep on the server
[23:35:15] <technomancy> that's literally the whole point of unit
[23:35:26] <af> imode: it is foss, but it's rather heavy
[23:35:38] <imode> af: the landing page certainly fooled me, thought they pulled a fast one.
[23:35:55] <technomancy> why add another disjoint thing that's like ... "unit but worse" to your language?
[23:36:04] <imode> technomancy: in the rust case, is function definition a statement, then? what's the value there?
[23:36:13] <af> imode: yea. I'm not a fan of runing these blackbox docker containers in the name of self hosting.
[23:36:22] <companion_cube> imode: toplevel statement, I guess.
[23:36:28] <companion_cube> same as `let`
[23:36:37] <imode> sooo how is that a "mistake".
[23:36:38] <companion_cube> but these are clearly not expression contexts, they just name things
[23:36:38] *** Quits: pyrorock (~Dont@37.222.8.156) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:36:53] <technomancy> IMO let shouldn't work without let ... in
[23:37:05] <companion_cube> let in is spelled `let ;` in rust
[23:37:07] <companion_cube> that's all
[23:37:15] <imode> right, but all-or-none is what I'm hearing here. everything is an expression or nothing+epsilon is an expression.
[23:37:19] <technomancy> but for indentation purposes it's OK to fudge a bit and say "the in is just the rest of the file"
[23:37:41] <imode> ironically I'm in favor of everything-is-an-expression but I take everything to an extreme and don't use types.
[23:37:42] <technomancy> so the value of the let expression is the final thing in the scope it introduces
[23:38:27] <imode> I guess I'm arguing that if there wasn't perceived inconsistencies we wouldn't have that blog post.
