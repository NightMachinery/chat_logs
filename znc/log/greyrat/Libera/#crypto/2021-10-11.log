[06:35:56] <SymbioticFemale> ms7821: i'm only releasing it as a teaser. my intention is to do the final release as a library or in the manner that gpg/gpg2 exists with a basic console interface, but easy for  others can build proper GUIs on top.
[06:37:03] <SymbioticFemale> the codebase is incredibly small, the protocol incredibly simple, with no non-standard libraries except libevent and libsodium, so auditing will be child's play, basically.
[06:37:38] <SymbioticFemale> portability (c99) and ease of auditing are two of the key points

[07:01:20] <SymbioticFemale> opinions for: encryption is best in layers, what if tor is flawed? + skeptical claims of tor protocol being perfect forward-safe

[07:28:37] <SymbioticFemale> i think there is no question about whether the connections to network nodes are forward safe, but the question is whether the client <-> onion connection at the rendezous point ( hop 4 of 7) is forward safe
[07:31:15] <SymbioticFemale> i think this is where they describe the handshake at the rendezous point: https://github.com/torproject/torspec/blob/main/rend-spec-v3.txt#L1851
[07:37:23] <SymbioticFemale> https://github.com/torproject/torspec/blob/main/rend-spec-v3.txt#L1935
[07:38:08] <SymbioticFemale> they definately are implementing session keys here at the rendezous point, so the concerns about forward secrecy should be unfounded
[07:46:47] <SymbioticFemale> therefore, based on my protocol design and relevant principles, i should not layer on additional encryption or session keys / unnecessarily bloat my codebase. anyone who has concerns about the underlying protocol should ---> torproject and not attempt to add redundant encryption in my library

[15:32:28] <MacGyver> Depends on what you mean by "familiar".
[15:32:38] <MacGyver> Ask your actual question, we'll go from there.
[15:34:50] <Guest95> my local gym is using gantner locks with mifare classic 1k cards.
[15:36:04] <Guest95> i use tools to get the keys to access the sectors
[15:36:34] *** Quits: yggdrasil (~yggdrasil@67-0-14-108.albq.qwest.net) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[15:37:19] <Guest95> playing around with the content, changing values  etc 
[15:38:11] <Guest95> cloning works fine, but they have a special kind of encryption i cant decrypt or atleast identify
[15:40:11] <Guest95> so my question is: is anyone familiar with these cards and locks, like, if someone worked with them for a period of time and knows more about how they work and communication between card and reader etc
[15:40:18] <aczid> it's possible to define an application specific protocol on top of such cards
[15:40:43] *** Joins: Warped (~Warped@user/warped)
[15:41:46] <Guest95> yes, wouldnt it mean its an additional layer you have to peele off ?

[15:42:15] <aczid> could be, mifare ultralight cards are also used like that for public transport in my country
[15:42:39] *** Joins: yggdrasil (~yggdrasil@67-0-14-108.albq.qwest.net)
[15:42:55] <aczid> in practice that's much more secure than the mfc cards
[15:43:13] <Guest95> mfc are poorly secured
[15:43:19] <aczid> i know :)
[15:43:38] <Guest95> big companies still use them
[15:43:49] <Guest95> is it because its cheaper?
[15:44:29] <aczid> cheaper than desfire ev2, definitely
[15:44:52] <aczid> I can't speak for big companies :) but the total cost of ownership is not just the cards themselves
[15:45:08] <Guest95> in the case of this gym, they use  desfire ev2 for their master key
[15:45:36] <Guest95> ah i see

[15:47:25] <Guest95> would like to show the data in different cards i collected
[15:48:11] <Guest95> so if i later during the day bring this subject up again, its because i need to leave now
[15:53:26] <rk4> feels like how 99% of the locks in my country are easily pickable...a crappy card is still enough to do it's job for the masses
[15:55:25] <Guest95> i believe the problem with digitally controlled locks is once someone finds a vulnarubality
[15:56:16] <msfninja_mob> vulnerability*
[15:56:22] <Guest95> suddenly all of them are jeaperdized
[15:56:31] <Guest95> oh i hate that spelling so much
[15:56:48] <MacGyver> jeopardized* :P
[15:57:00] <Guest95> :(
[15:57:10] <MacGyver> Sorry that was necessary for comedic effect.
[15:57:29] <MacGyver> But yeah, so, the whole thing with the MiFare classic break.
[15:57:34] <Guest95> righfully so!
[15:57:37] <MacGyver> Public transport didn't actually care that much.
[15:57:48] <MacGyver> Government facilities management, much more so.
[15:58:07] <Guest95> especially europe
[15:59:19] <Guest95> you can just fully charge a card and never pay. not something im suggesting or encouraging people to do, but they really dont care
[16:00:10] <MacGyver> The reason they don't care about that attack vector is because it's small fries and it's not a perfect crime.
[16:00:15] <MacGyver> People get caught.
[16:00:34] <msfninja_mob> previous city i lived in has free public transit
[16:01:23] <Guest95> how would they get caught if cards arent connected or associated somehow with the persons identity?
[16:02:41] <msfninja_mob> if the person holds the card in his hand it's his card

[16:03:42] <Guest95> ah true, my bad
[16:04:18] <MacGyver> Same reason that the whole car charging fuck-up isn't really *that* much of a problem.
[16:04:40] <MacGyver> Context: car charging in the Netherlands uses authentication based on a MiFare UID.
[16:04:49] <MacGyver> And I use the term authentication loosely there.
[16:05:04] <MacGyver> As in, literally just the UID. They don't even try to use any kind of security mechanism.
[16:05:41] <msfninja_mob> really
[16:06:04] <MacGyver> But: what's the business case for the criminal? A car is stuck at the charge station for a while, just go to the charge station using the cloned card (and you can easily detect cards are cloned, because the same card will be in use simultaneously), and put a wheel clamp on.
[16:06:16] <MacGyver> No, the real problem with this is stealing the charging cables.
[16:06:44] <Guest95> wow
[16:06:45] <MacGyver> And *that* is not really a problem for the energy suppliers or charge station operators.
[16:06:57] <Guest95> its sad :(
[16:07:21] <aczid> many building 'security' systems use a similar id-based check
[16:07:24] <MacGyver> I would like to say something now that starts with "To be fair to the people designing this system", but I really can't bring myself to.
[16:07:29] <MacGyver> There's really no excuse for this.
[16:07:46] <MacGyver> There's movement towards better systems but this'll be around for a while longer.
