[10:17:32] <DrNostril> hi guys
[10:17:42] <DrNostril> lol kaos
[10:18:02] <DrNostril> i know theyre loud but i keep locking up my 64 gb ram
[10:18:25] <DrNostril> i've been idolizing low power computing and pure matrix math for years
[10:18:34] <DrNostril> suddenly i feel alive and drunk with power
[10:26:20] <rickyrick> lel
[10:26:28] <rickyrick> "low power computing"
[10:26:44] <rickyrick> Bring back Beowulf clusters
[10:28:20] <DrNostril> that's literally what i was thinking
[10:29:06] <DrNostril> but after 1200 hours reading docs and 2 ounces of weed i realize gotdayum there's so much cheap computing power available in rack mount format
[10:29:13] <DrNostril> it's so damn cheap
[10:29:30] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[10:29:31] <DrNostril> beowulf cluster of dell power edges
[10:30:24] <DrNostril> i am working on a project that (as written *ahem*) will require ~120GB ram
[10:30:50] <DrNostril> so I'm like I can reuse this code and keep cranking out huge projects if I just get a damn server
[10:30:55] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[10:30:57] <DrNostril> the mac studio is sexy though
[10:31:08] <rickyrick> I can't imagine you'd get a lot of cores for $750 though
[10:31:17] <DrNostril> dude
[10:31:21] <DrNostril> it's not fair
[10:31:29] <DrNostril> ebay and amazon
[10:31:33] <DrNostril> newegg
[10:31:35] <DrNostril> etc
[10:31:56] <DrNostril> 40 cores?
[10:32:16] <rickyrick> Yeah I'm seeing stuff in that range
[10:32:28] <DrNostril> it's not a billion but the dual xeon setup with mad ram and nvme drives is really really available
[10:32:38] <rickyrick> If RAM is your bottleneck that makes a lot of sense
[10:32:44] <rickyrick> Unless you can get your hands on a big optane drive
[10:32:45] <DrNostril> it totally is
[10:32:51] <DrNostril> whats that
[10:33:06] <rickyrick> Intel's supposed answer to unified storage/memory
[10:33:11] <DrNostril> oh wow
[10:33:19] <DrNostril> we've all been waiting....
[10:33:30] <rickyrick> I think it didn't live up to it's hype
[10:33:40] <rickyrick> Partly because it was memory-tier prices still
[10:33:58] <DrNostril> i have been preaching for years that ram/swap will stop existing
[10:34:05] <DrNostril> i hope that actually happens
[10:34:06] <rickyrick> Also still actually had limited write cycles IIRC
[10:34:09] <rickyrick> Despite all the marketing
[10:34:57] <DrNostril> my meaty home defense thinkpad is the most powerful machine i've ever had
[10:35:12] <DrNostril> and i was thinking about how to upgrade for bigger projects
[10:35:28] <rickyrick> AWS server time :^)
[10:35:29] <DrNostril> am i dumb to just buy an aftermarket server with hella ram?
[10:35:44] <DrNostril> i really don't enjoy data science in the cloud
[10:35:50] <rickyrick> ikr
[10:35:54] <DrNostril> i have done a bunch on digital ocean
[10:36:03] <DrNostril> but i want to heat my house with the math
[10:36:46] <DrNostril> also lots of secret contract work prefers in house computing
[10:37:15] <rickyrick> With in-house data requirements, a thicc server is pretty much unavoidable
[10:37:52] <DrNostril> thank you for saying so
[10:38:00] <DrNostril> i have been trying to justify this for years
[10:38:23] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[10:38:30] <rickyrick> It's all well and good until someone has to open their wallet
[10:38:33] <DrNostril> can i run a pi cluster? can i use a mac mini? my thinkpad is enough if i cool it? digital ocean?
[10:39:15] <DrNostril> these u1 servers caked with ram (no gpu) are real cheap
[10:39:38] <DrNostril> mac studio money gets you some serious beef
[10:39:41] <rickyrick> :^)
[10:39:51] <rickyrick> I put a +400 MHz overclock on my thinkpad
[10:39:53] <rickyrick> Runs toasty
[10:40:01] <DrNostril> completely agree
[10:40:05] <DrNostril> 100% support
[10:40:19] * rickyrick puts marshmellows at the exhaust vent
[10:40:21] <DrNostril> that feeling when you sudo apt install thinkfan
[10:40:40] <DrNostril> oh no maybe i lost him
[10:40:41] <rickyrick> thinkfan doesn't run the fan enough by default
[10:40:45] <rickyrick> gotta go fast (TM)
[10:40:46] <DrNostril> lmao
[10:40:54] <DrNostril> actually lolling rn

[10:41:23] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[10:41:49] <DrNostril> should i go power edge or proliant
[10:42:06] <rickyrick> Whichever has the best power/money

[10:43:24] <DrNostril> "knuckle up if you're buckwild."
[10:43:38] <rickyrick> _//\\( ͡ ͡° ͡°  ʖ ͡° ͡°)//\\_
[10:44:30] <DrNostril> do you give a shit about cryptoworld?
[10:45:16] <rickyrick> It's fun to watch
[10:45:36] <rickyrick> Regret deciding to not mine in 2002 though
[10:45:40] <rickyrick> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[10:48:07] <DrNostril> i mined a bitcoin in 2013
[10:48:15] <DrNostril> lost it in a russian scam
[10:48:19] <rickyrick> LEL
[10:48:28] <DrNostril> claimed to be a  british mining pool
[10:48:43] <DrNostril> wasn't even stolen, i literally gave these pirates a bitcoin
[10:48:51] <rickyrick> Well that's quite the way to lose a BTC
[10:48:54] <DrNostril> i have pics of the mining rig
[10:49:22] <DrNostril> at least... we had electricity included in the lease
[10:49:35] <rickyrick> Yeah that's pretty much a necessity
[10:49:40] <DrNostril> started mining with 1 asic chip on rpi 2
[10:49:42] <rickyrick> Gone are the days where you could mine with a Pentium 3
[10:50:06] <DrNostril> gradually stashed the proceeds and bought more chips until we had real power
[10:50:16] <DrNostril> day traded all the mined material
[10:50:24] <DrNostril> made a full btc in 1 year
[10:50:41] <DrNostril> handed it off to some russian script kiddies
[10:51:28] <DrNostril> i am ready to go back in, but in a different way
[11:04:22] <shrysr> Colombo: ty. yeah that is what I kind of gathered from the advanced R book. Use C or RCpp to write faster bits of code, after identifying bottlenecks.

[15:51:28] <Bayes> shrysr did you get an answer on vectorized functions?
[15:53:58] <Bayes> for two vectors x and y, `z <- x + y` is a vectorized function working elementwise, i.e., `z[i] <- x[i] + y[i]`
[15:54:26] <Bayes> these are traditionally achieved via for loops, but in R for loops are functions ("everything is a function")

[15:55:43] <Bayes> so doing `z <- rep(0, N); for (i in 1:N) z[i] <- x[i] + y[i]` is terribly slow because (i) for, (ii) 1:N, (iii) `[<-` are function calls, you have huge overhead
[15:56:01] <Bayes> `+`(x, y) is written in C under the hood so it's orders of magnitude faster

[22:28:20] <since_> (basically how to get a matrix from a timeseries signal vector where i can throw mvfft on)
[22:33:21] <rickyrick> You mean you want indices 1:400 in the first row, then 2:401 in the second, etc?
[22:36:43] <since_> yes, but columns would be better
[22:37:01] <since_> or 1:400 in first col, 200:600 in second col
[22:37:31] <rickyrick> ya ok then apply is your friend :^)
