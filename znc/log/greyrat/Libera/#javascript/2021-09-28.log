[17:28:18] <thykka> varaindemian, i suppose you're going to want to look into Adobe's documentation regarding JS in PDF (https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/acrobatsdk/pdfs/acrobatsdk_jsdevguide.pdf) but the problem I see with this, is that any such solution will require the PDF viewer to comply with Adobe's "standard". Seeing how most people don't even have Adobe Reader these days, I have a hunch
[17:28:20] <thykka> that it's going to be almost impossible to get consistent results
[17:29:20] <thykka> if it works, fine. If it doesn't, there might not be much you can do about it. Not all pdf viewers allow Javascript, and those that do, might place other restrictions in order to prevent tracking and other malicious activity

[17:30:07] <thykka> or other potential security issues
[17:30:26] <varaindemian> yeah
[17:30:38] <thykka> with that in mind, I would say it's way easier to track PDF downloads, than actual views
[17:30:59] <thykka> or at least more reliable
[17:31:35] <thykka> another option is to embed a pdf viewer on the website, so that people use that instead of their own pdf viewer

[20:07:07] <austincheney> systemfault, its still garbage though
[20:07:45] <austincheney> I would rather them write something wrong that I can guide them to correct than be burdened by a bunch of unnecessary decoration that MUST be there because the framework says so

[20:12:26] <banana_> yeah ok that instead. available tools instead some monolithic thing

[20:16:46] <Donitz> nope
[20:16:56] <systemfault> I reinvented the wheel a ton of times... for learning purposes, but when it was time to ship in production, I just picked some battle-tested tech
[20:16:57] <austincheney> i really don't think building UIs is that challenging.  Accomodating the network is far more challenging.  Really, with UIs, if you don't dick it up the browser does most of the heavy lifing for you anyways
[20:16:59] <prussian> or... does it?
[20:17:01] <ljharb> the very phrase is illustrating how nobody has yet invented a better wheel, only iteratively improved it
[20:17:13] <banana_> ljharb: ?? no I was just saying mandating a monolithic js framework makes app developers dumber
[20:17:14] <Donitz> tons of people have invented wheels
[20:17:20] <ljharb> prussian: again, great question that always adds value to any conversation
[20:17:21] <Donitz> commercial software is full of own wheels
[20:17:25] <ljharb> banana_: right. and no, it doesn't.
[20:17:31] <banana_> or caught in busywork so they dont have as much time to think critically
[20:17:36] <ljharb> Donitz: they're all the same wheel
[20:17:39] <banana_> ok nvm then
[20:17:41] <Donitz> Hah!
[20:17:44] <Donitz> no they're not
[20:17:49] <prussian> ljharb: so true.
[20:17:53] <prussian> that's what I do
[20:17:54] <ljharb> Donitz: there are iterative differences between them
[20:18:02] <Donitz> and quite often a complete re-invention
[20:18:03] <ljharb> Donitz: but fundamentally they are not "reinvented", they're just "improved"
[20:18:20] <Donitz> when you need a a* pathfinder, do you try to adapt an already existing one?
[20:18:26] <Donitz> Or do you "re-invent the wheel"
[20:18:32] <Donitz> ie, write it from scratch
[20:18:36] <Donitz> to fit your particular need
[20:18:43] <prussian> both
[20:18:45] <prussian> usually
[20:18:47] <banana_> ljharb: I think I missed your point but that's probably because I'm dumb

[21:43:05] <merpnderp> austincheney: Yes, we have an base angular app that is massive, but we wanted to move to vue without a full rewrite, so we have angular load our vue app.
[21:43:25] <devslash> has anyone here used Ionic ?
[21:44:08] <merpnderp> austincheney: there are currently 67 complete apps in this thing, 4 of them Vue, and another 18 in beta, which are all Vue.
[21:44:41] <merpnderp> The only data flow between angular and vue is the current user and selected user (if its the type of app with a selected user)

[21:47:39] <merpnderp> For instance I have a PositionManager app in Angular that's responsible for loading all of a positions basic information and showing the current user the apps they can open for that particular position. It was a giant ball of fur in Angular and took me about 5 minutes to rewrite in Vue in clean, sleek, code that makes your spine tingle.
[21:48:40] <merpnderp> It has to make like 30 api calls, has to check 3 different authorization schemes, has to know how to mount an angular applet or a vue applet, and was generally ugly.
[21:48:50] <merpnderp> In Vue it's a pleasure to look at.
[21:49:23] <ljharb> pagios: only when you emit from server to clients, i believe
[21:49:26] <merpnderp> Well maybe 30. It makes a lot.
[21:49:35] <merpnderp> Granted the Angular is all Angular 1.4
[21:49:45] <merpnderp> It's so old its grandkids have grandkids.

[22:11:03] <austincheney> angular makes my soul bleed.  It is unnecessarily excessively OOP for people who have no idea (nor want to) what is going on in the front-end.  I really get the feeling Google wrote this for their Java developers after Google Web Toolkit was a such an epic failure

[22:17:04] <banana_> you know something's up when the author of https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997 starts the book off complaining how things are getting messier

[22:17:38] <banana_> but good book I learned a lot about design patterns that lead to other resources about patterns that helped me out
[22:18:10] <systemfault> Joshua Bloch is top in his field
[22:19:10] <austincheney> C# solved this problem in the most elegant way imaginable.  The language used to force OOP by mandating a file be wrapped in a class.  To dramatically reduce boilerplate and decoration they removed only that one rule.
[22:22:17] <banana_> you're talking about a forwarding class right?
[22:23:08] <banana_> I think that's the same idea as using components on the front-end just done in a different medium I guess? as in the context of a template and not class instance?

[22:25:03] <banana_> so you get best of both worlds essentially but to get reusability with the wrapping you'd have to make an abstract wrapper i.e. abstract skeletal class... or component for FE template stuff.

[22:26:09] <banana_> and you extend the abstract skeletal class and pass the wrapped object but because the inheritance is so minimally used I guess it doesn't  break composition over inheritance
