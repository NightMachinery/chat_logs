[15:18:26] <codingquark> Alright! Time to upload the talk to FTP!
[15:18:58] <codingquark> Please pardon my poor editing skills, the audio has lost some fidelity and words sound wrong to my ears at places :-P
[15:58:25] <codingquark> There it is, done and uploaded
[16:28:16] <bandali> codingquark, haha :p awesome, thanks for the upload! i'm sure it'll be great
[16:28:55] <codingquark> bandali: well, it's going to be average. But I am cutting slack because this is the first time I am recording ;)
[16:29:19] <codingquark> Having no high expectations from myself cannot lead to disasters at least
[16:29:30] <bandali> ay! gotta start from somewhere ;)
[16:32:35] <codingquark> I have also uploaded a transcript
[16:33:42] <bandali> oh that's awesome :) thanks for doing that
[16:38:59] <codingquark> :)
[16:48:36] <sachac> codingquark: yay, downloading it now!
[16:49:00] <codingquark> Oh my, someone else is gonna watch that video! Time to hide away
[17:18:57] <sachac> yay mbork has finished writing a book on Emacs Lisp; ugh I want to squeeze it into my talk
[17:19:52] <zaeph> sachac: Time to Ã—1.25 it. :o)
[17:20:42] <zaeph> You've piqued my interest too; there's no going back now.
[17:21:01] <sachac> no, it'll fit, I have 30 seconds extra
[17:21:14] <sachac> I just have to hunt down pronunciation
[17:21:19] <sachac> and record
[17:21:41] <sachac> next time I'm going to do all the audio on my phone for consistency ;b
[17:40:42] <grym> i twisted my boss' arm into expensing me a boom mic simply because it kills the keyboard noises from my machine while we're talking on meetings 
[17:40:58] <grym> the dac/amp probably helps too ...
