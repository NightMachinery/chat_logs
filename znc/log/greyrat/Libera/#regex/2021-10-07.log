[06:42:44] <re101-quail-26> nup, as mentioned the regexReplaceAll function needs the pattern as a valid string, it doesnt like "\"###[^\"]*###\"" as the string, due to needing to escape the quotes, make sense?

[06:44:08] <jargon> *sees the name in the user list*
[06:51:12] <digitok> 07re101-quail-26, yep, "escaping" usually means preceding the char with a \
[06:51:22] <digitok> that's how you'd do it in 99% of langs
[06:51:34] <digitok> 07jargon, he owns re101
[06:52:47] <digitok> if it's something weird like powershell, it'd be "hi""hi" or "hi`"hi" instead of "hi\"hi"
[06:55:19] <digitok> it says it uses java regex though, so you'd expect what i mentioned earlier to work
[06:56:10] <digitok> oh, unless it wants the escapes escaped also

[19:18:56] <re101-gar-30> First of all thanks to anybody who replies,  I have googled already and have not found the answer to my scenario.  Given the sample string of:  some data,some data,"some other, data",some data,some data,some data
[19:20:06] <re101-gar-30> I am trying locate the substing in double quotes and then locate the comma and remove it/ or replace it.    You can probably tell this is .csv file that I cant ingest correctly because of it
[19:21:37] <re101-gar-30> so end result should be: some data,some data,some other data,some data,some data,some data.  I forgot to mention removing the double quotes as final step but that is easy
[19:23:22] <re101-gar-30> OH and I am trying to do this in C#
[19:33:00] <re101-gar-30> So pattern I want to find (the substring) is \"*\"

[19:56:21] <OnlineCop> re101-gar-30: https://regex101.com/r/Cb8Gay/2 perhaps? It doesn't remove the double quotes on this pass, but removes the commas that occur within double quotes.
[19:56:27] <re101-gar-30> +rewt  I totally get that but unfortunately bulk upload for SQL server doesnt listen to double quotes. Its a know issue
[19:57:50] <re101-gar-30> +OnlineCop really appreciate you taking the time.
[19:58:00] <OnlineCop> That is trying to assert that double quotes that occur to the left are balanced, but don't consider "" (CSV-style of double quotes).
[19:59:03] <re101-gar-30> It should do the job--- will find out soon enough -- again thanks - and even your example I learned about how to use testing in 101 - great resource - sorry for being such a newb
[19:59:24] <OnlineCop> I mean, depending on how "safe" you feel your data is, you could simply match all double quotes and all commas that occur between (both after and before) double quotes...
[19:59:29] <rewt> if it's sql server 2017 or newer, you can use FORMAT='CSV' to have it treat those commas as data
[19:59:51] <OnlineCop> Do you have any data that still requires that it's quoted, but that doesn't contain commas (or whatever the delimiter is)?
[20:02:23] <re101-gar-30> +rewt  Thanks a lot I just tried that for BULK INSERT and got different erorrs so that might just solve this problem. Now need to track down the next erorrs probably not RegEx related.  Appreciate everyone who chimed in
[20:03:17] *** Joins: ormaaj (~ormaaj@user/ormaaj)
[20:03:29] <rewt> in case it's a syntax error, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/bulk-insert-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017#format--csv for proper syntax

[22:05:35] <JohnDoe2> re101-mayfly-97 that's the kind of thing you want to avoid running with regex <p> if not before <span> or 3rd <p> in <div> if not within div with class "crap"... it just gets to be busy work, and it's unreliable.
[22:05:52] <re101-mayfly-97> For you guys, it's child's play 
[22:05:54] <JohnDoe2> re101-mayfly-97 give a parser a try of it's a single file edit it manually.

[22:07:27] <JohnDoe2> what programming language are you using this in?
