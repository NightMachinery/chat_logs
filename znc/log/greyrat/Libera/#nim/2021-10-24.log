[00:07:52] <FromDiscord> <tandy> dom said clear the folder in ur homedir
[00:31:05] <Mister_Magister> works since 2 hours
[00:31:09] <Mister_Magister> maybe devel fixed it
[00:47:27] <FromDiscord> <tandy> `cstrToNimstr` is there a way to use this on browser javascript?
[00:47:47] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> doesnt `.string` work?
[00:47:59] <FromDiscord> <tandy> hmm il try , i was using `$`
[00:48:04] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> or `string(yourStr)`
[00:49:20] <FromDiscord> <tandy> string() and .string dont work
[00:49:31] <FromDiscord> <tandy> only $ compiles, but when testing js errors out
[00:50:18] <FromDiscord> <tandy> another reason why we need typeunions in nim \:)
[00:50:36] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I dont see how that changes this
[00:51:19] <FromDiscord> <tandy> im converting from cstring to string because im using a "pure" type
[00:51:29] <FromDiscord> <tandy> like how the matrix-nim-sdk api works

[00:55:59] <FromDiscord> <tandy> hmm
[00:56:23] <FromDiscord> <tandy> il probably switch the pure types to use cstring

[05:31:55] <NimEventer> New post on r/nim by Ether-naut: Generic issues, see https://reddit.com/r/nim/comments/qeinci/generic_issues/
[06:07:20] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> sent a long message, see http://ix.io/3CDi
[06:09:00] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's to easily support Nim \<-\> Python, there is no reason to use it unless you want to use some python code
[06:12:55] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> and it's better than just calling it as a command line os thingy?
[06:14:46] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Yes when you have to expose many functions and need to also use objects
[06:20:35] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> If you want to make a library for python you'd probably want to use genny to make a nice nim dynamic lib
[06:22:31] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> I was just wondering at this stage (and something for me to possibly try later on) ... thank you both!
[06:28:28] *** Quits: arkurious (~arkurious@user/arkurious) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:55:37] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> "import std/os" vs "import os" ... is the first way better because there might be other os's out there?
[06:55:59] <FromDiscord> <Rika> yes
[06:56:26] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Also cause all new std libraries are forced `std/`
[06:57:26] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> so some new std libraries wont be able to be imported unless I use "std/" ?
[06:57:33] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Indeed
[06:57:41] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> ok thank you!
[07:01:54] <FromDiscord> <rainbowasteroids> that change is going to be enforced with nim 2, right?
[07:02:09] <FromDiscord> <Rika> dunno
[07:02:21] <FromDiscord> <Rika> know that the version after 1.8 is not 2
[07:02:48] <FromDiscord> <Rika> nim 2 might be a decade away or w/e
[07:04:29] <FromDiscord> <rainbowasteroids> I thought nim 2 was going to be when the compiler can compile under ORC
[07:06:31] <FromDiscord> <Rika> no?
[07:06:38] <FromDiscord> <Rika> i dont remember anyone saying that
[07:07:14] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> there's the 2.0 forum post which araq seems to elude to that
[07:07:16] <FromDiscord> <rainbowasteroids> > â†µ> Once Nim can bootstrap via --gc\:orc we should make this the default GC as it works best with destructor based custom memory management. Since this is all based on the "new runtime" which isn't ABI compatible this deserves the 2.0 version.â†µ>
[07:07:25] <FromDiscord> <rainbowasteroids> https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/7983
[07:12:28] <FromDiscord> <Rika> so here
[07:12:46] <FromDiscord> <Rika> once nim compiles under orc -> orc will be default gcâ†µwhich will only happen on nim 2
[07:13:19] <FromDiscord> <Rika> nim compiling on orc doesnt imply nim 2 will release, just another step closer to it

[18:55:55] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> damn it
[18:55:56] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> and don't forget `echo` does not add spaces
[18:56:05] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> !eval echo "Nim version is" &  NimVersion
[18:56:07] <FromDiscord> <Rika> unlike print in python
[18:56:08] <NimBot> Nim version is1.6.0
[18:56:15] <FromDiscord> <Rika> !eval echo "Nim version is ", NimVersion
[18:56:18] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> oh well :/
[18:56:18] <NimBot> Nim version is 1.6.0
[18:56:42] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> got it
[18:56:45] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> thanks
[18:56:58] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> and there are also `NimMinor`, `NimMajor` etc., if you don't want to unparse the string
[18:58:19] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> i just mainly need nimversion
[18:58:21] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> that's all
[18:58:31] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> it is enough at least for me

[20:18:43] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> is there a way to do partial array initialization?
[20:19:33] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3CGo
[20:31:11] <FromDiscord> <Rika> no
[20:31:33] <FromDiscord> <Rika> not cleanly
[20:31:48] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> so I need a macro for this?
[20:31:49] <FromDiscord> <jmgomez> Hey guys, can nimhcr be compiled (and used) against cpp?
[20:32:01] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> nimhcr doesn't really work tmk
[20:32:18] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> better off just writing your own plugin system
[20:32:36] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> or using something like - https://github.com/fungos/cr
[20:32:59] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> or - https://github.com/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus
[20:34:29] <FromDiscord> <jmgomez> oh, it kinda worked with the C target
[20:34:38] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah it kind of works
[20:34:45] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> for toy examples
[20:34:57] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but feel free to try and get it working for your purposes
[20:35:21] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I haven't touched it in years which I'm pretty sure is the last time anyone worked on it
[20:35:31] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> before I tried using it
[20:36:45] <FromDiscord> <jmgomez> Okay, Im just playing around with the possibilities/workflows of nim. Thanks for the heads up
[20:37:08] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> hmm I guess I'll just create a proc to initialize things

[22:47:09] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> probably futhark first, it just happen to be "just working" from what I've seen
[22:47:22] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> c2nim is mostly a DIY solution in the end
[22:47:29] <Pyautogui> Really just listing them for anyone who would like to make a choice, to spare people the trouble of finding them. No real recommendation.
