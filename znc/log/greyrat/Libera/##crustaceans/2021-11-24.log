[00:31:41] <indigo> Woot, The Lounge finally got message search
[00:43:27] <dminkovsky> nice
[00:43:36] <dminkovsky> i should try that out
[00:43:43] <dminkovsky> but i just want everything in irssi
[00:43:48] <dminkovsky> erm, in tmux
[00:44:07] <indigo> It's been super reliable for me
[00:44:33] <indigo> I just like it because I can switch quickly between my home PC, work PC and phone
[00:44:44] <dminkovsky> yes sometimes i'm like i wish i could look at irc on my phone
[00:44:46] <dminkovsky> and then i think
[00:44:50] <dminkovsky> thank god i can't look at irc on my phone
[00:44:52] <dminkovsky> :)
[00:44:54] <indigo> LOL yes
[00:45:15] <dminkovsky> apple does a good job of making it hard to install ssh keys on your phone
[00:45:26] <dminkovsky> i mean, way harder than my laziness can surmount
[00:45:29] <imode> indigo: how's it deal with your phone? on firefox on android I can hardly use it apart from reading.
[00:45:43] <imode> the input text box keeps getting overshadowed by the keyboard.
[00:47:52] <indigo> imode: It works OK on iOS Safari
[00:48:03] <indigo> The input box slides up when the keyboard comes out
[00:48:40] <dminkovsky> weird that on android it does resize the view
[00:48:48] <dminkovsky> android usually handles that a lot more elegantly than ios
[00:48:52] <imode> yeah really.
[00:48:58] <imode> hope that's fixed or I might submit a PR.
[00:49:22] <imode> my lazy ass should just set up a bouncer and use a native client.
[00:52:44] <dminkovsky> what's a native client in this context
[00:52:51] <dminkovsky> good day imode
[00:55:42] <imode> allo dminkovsky.
[00:55:59] <imode> and, something that's android-native.
[00:56:45] <dminkovsky> ah
[00:56:52] <dminkovsky> the bouncer, yes
[00:57:14] <imode> so android client -> bouncer.
[00:57:19] <dminkovsky> back in 2012 i was on IRC for work and had irssi running in a VM and ssh on my phone
[00:57:22] <dminkovsky> it was great
[00:57:35] <dminkovsky> cause android makes it much easier to put a private key onto there
[00:57:39] <dminkovsky> and use a terminal emulator
[00:57:56] <imode> I should probably do that.
[00:57:59] <dminkovsky> imode: so a bouncer is just a bot type thing
[00:58:02] <dminkovsky> ^?
[00:58:16] <imode> a bouncer is basically a proxy.
[00:58:20] <dminkovsky> yeah i wanna do that except i'd never just not look at my phone again
[00:58:26] <imode> it acts as a client.
[00:58:36] <imode> that you can connect to. it holds your connection open.
[00:58:45] <dminkovsky> so what would you bounce
[00:59:04] <dminkovsky> when you open your android client, you'd get channel history there?
[00:59:07] <dminkovsky> on your phone, i mean

[07:02:14] <indigo> I‚Äôve always enjoyed reverse engineering and reading code
[07:03:02] <indigo> I gotta get better at asking people instead of reading code so much, apparently it looks better if you send a lot of emails out with questions

[12:56:14] <gthm> also "everyone do sane things" is an unstable equilibrium even if you get there, because particular software doing non-sane things and only being compatible with itself is a feature for market-dominant companies; see Microsoft in the 90's

[13:41:39] <edk> also i've decided that thinking "junior" and "senior" have actual meanings is a junior view, while any senior developer understands that they're just bullshit corporate speak that may, at best, describe a set of attributes that's valued by a particular company

[17:32:51] <dminkovsky> jjuran: :)
[17:33:23] <jjuran> The newsletter sidebar isn't occluding anything, but I'm going to uBlock it out of spite :-)
[17:33:38] <dminkovsky> i got to say react hooks are one of the cleverest APIs i've ever encountered
[17:34:28] <Geekingfrog> dminkovsky, could you elaborate for someone who has familiarity with react but hasn't touched it in a while and don't know hooks ?
[17:34:43] <dminkovsky> jjuran: just looked up the word "occluding"!
[17:35:29] <dminkovsky> Geekingfrog: well fwiw like all APIs it's probably one of those things you need to experience w/ a particular usecase?
[17:35:51] <dminkovsky> but, like, so
[17:36:04] <dminkovsky> React is all about the coordination of rendering and state, right?
[17:36:20] <Geekingfrog> yup
[17:36:21] <dminkovsky> you render something, and when state updates, it rerenders to update to whatever then new state is
[17:36:31] <dminkovsky> hooks like you surgically set that up
[17:36:36] <dminkovsky> let you*
[17:36:42] <dminkovsky> and surgically compose that
[17:37:08] <dminkovsky> they let you very precisely abstract and compose that behavior
[17:37:44] <dminkovsky> (the fact that hooks are composable is everything; and of course they are because they're just functions with special semantics to React)
[17:38:08] <Geekingfrog> yeah, composition is in general very nice.
[17:38:15] <dminkovsky> they let you very precisely abstract and then reuse interaction-render-related behaviors
[17:38:19] <dminkovsky> and state management
[17:38:32] <dminkovsky> they lead to good abstractions that don't leak
[17:38:37] <dminkovsky> which is the best thing an API can do
[17:38:43] <dminkovsky> at least they do that for me
[17:39:03] <dminkovsky> sorry all this is not particularly specific
[17:39:07] <companion_cube> I've only read the docs, but it seemed like hooks were pretty leaky an abstraction, no?
[17:39:18] <companion_cube> like, you have to call them in a fixed order, and never inside conditionals
[17:40:06] <dminkovsky> my definiton of a leaky abstraction is one that doesn't "scale" to handle developing use/edge cases well
[17:40:17] <dminkovsky> it eventually starts to leak it usefulness
[17:40:33] <dminkovsky> certain APIs seem to help me write better abstractions than others,in that respect
[17:40:34] <jjuran> dminkovsky: I hope my choice of that word instead of a more common didn't end up obscuring my point :-)
[17:40:58] <dminkovsky> jjuran: not at all, it was great learn a word that's probably common and i somehow missed it all this time
[17:41:02] <jjuran> Anyway, yeah, Internet of Shit.
[17:41:47] <gwozniak> Tinkering with the layers and modifier keys on my keyboard.  I feel slightly hobbled atm
[17:42:04] <dminkovsky> companion_cube: "you have to call them in a fixed order" | not sure about this; a hook is a functio nyou call inside of another function; so its order of apeparance is just its order in the code
[17:42:23] <dminkovsky> "and never inside conditionals" this is true -- but that makes sense as a requirement to me
[17:42:42] <dminkovsky> adapting a hook for conditionality is trivial; ou put the conditional inside the hook
[17:42:48] <companion_cube> well the hooks are likely saving state based on their order of calls
[17:42:56] <dminkovsky> na hooks can do anything
[17:43:03] <companion_cube> (so as to save state between calls to the component)
[17:43:35] <dminkovsky> in the scheme of react my experience has been that the order of their appearance is insignificant
[17:43:43] <dminkovsky> i'll keep an eye out now that you mention it though
[17:43:59] <dminkovsky> i mean, if a hook returns something that some other hook uses, it needs to appear before that hook, yes
[17:44:13] <dminkovsky> but that doesn't make anything difficult or limiting in my experience; thats just how all code works
[17:45:09] <dminkovsky> i'd show an example but it's better just to try them out whenever one has a chance
[17:45:19] <dminkovsky> like all things programming :)
[17:50:31] <companion_cube> from the docs: > Instead, React assumes that if you call useState many times, you do it in the same order during every render.
[17:50:53] <companion_cube> but that makes sense, again. I guess react stores an array of curretn values for each state hook
[17:51:04] <companion_cube> and then when it re-renders it gives them back in the same order from the array
[17:58:06] <dminkovsky> yeah that's all true
[17:58:35] <dminkovsky> a side effect of hooks being functions
[17:59:16] <dminkovsky> those lines in the docs draw a lot of attention but none of that has been something that comes into play ever
[17:59:21] <dminkovsky> they could remove those lines from the docs
[17:59:40] <dminkovsky> they should, really :)
[18:04:04] <companion_cube> idk, seems like an important invariant

[18:39:46] <dminkovsky> companion_cube: in practice it's not something i ever think about. every so often i do write code that by accdeint conditionally calls a hook; that gets picked up right away by eslint and i put the conditional inside the hook
[18:39:57] <pja> riv: used to.
[18:40:32] <riv> did you find it causes a slowdown?
[18:40:42] <riv> maybe i should just use normal android :/
[18:40:43] <pja> How good the support is probably varies from phone to phone.
[18:41:02] <pja> It was fine for me when I was using a Nexus4, but that was a very well supported phone.
[18:41:34] <pja> (Since then I used a Nokia for a few years, but they left the bootloader locked down, so I‚Äôm not back to Google with a Pixel 4a)
[18:44:05] <companion_cube> dminkovsky: yeah makes sense, ofc
[18:44:10] <companion_cube> hooks do seem nicer than classes
[18:44:30] <companion_cube> but then, all of that is a lot of magic to make you think JS is an incremental language :)
[18:47:34] <dminkovsky> they're so much nicer than classes. it's like a who other ballgame. i didn't really enjoy react very much before hooks
[18:48:02] <dminkovsky> i mean, i nejoyed it more than  anything else i'd tried up to that point; it was pretty incredible in relieving you of the need to mess w/ the dom
[18:48:06] <dminkovsky> but it was kind of confusing for me
[18:48:27] <dminkovsky> companion_cube: what's an 'incremental language' in this context?
[18:48:33] <dminkovsky> or any context hehee
[18:49:14] <companion_cube> well, excel, for example :)
[18:49:48] <companion_cube> not sure there are general purpose languages built on that particular feature, but you can find libraries for incrementality
[18:50:21] <dminkovsky> hmm excel
[18:50:23] <companion_cube> I think svelte might be the one actually
[18:50:33] <dminkovsky> haven't tried that yet; got stuck at react :)
[18:50:45] <dminkovsky> excel is like a functional tological sort machine
[18:50:59] <dminkovsky> sorts out all the dependencies and evaluates them
[18:50:59] <companion_cube> excel also doesn't recompute things that didn't change, like react :)
[18:51:18] <dminkovsky> why would JS be that, then?
[18:51:56] <dminkovsky> JS is JS :(
[18:52:27] <companion_cube> well, because nowadays everyone wants to make reactive UIs with this kind of abstraction :)
[18:52:36] <companion_cube> react sidesteps it by doing runtime diff
[18:56:05] <dminkovsky> i see yeah
[18:56:36] <dminkovsky> JS really stresses me out because i can't TDD and then i end up w/o tests and w/o types
[18:56:43] <dminkovsky> and therefore w/o software that works
[18:56:51] <companion_cube> can't use TS?
[18:56:59] <dminkovsky> i use TS thank the lord
[18:57:08] <Xe> i have a joke for you
[18:57:13] <Xe> it's webpack
[18:57:14] <companion_cube> so you do have some types
[18:57:31] <dminkovsky> i do, the types are the light
[18:57:35] <dminkovsky> Xe: lol
[18:57:48] <dminkovsky> i have a joke too
[18:57:56] <dminkovsky> how do you exit the apple store?
[18:58:14] <Xe> one way is to get naked and pee on customers
[18:58:16] <dminkovsky> (neighbor told me this one radnomly!)
[18:58:21] <dminkovsky> windows!
[18:58:26] <companion_cube> :D
[18:58:28] <dminkovsky> Xe: that works pretty well too!
[18:58:34] <companion_cube> they're large and very breakable, too
[18:58:46] <dminkovsky> hehe
[18:59:41] <dminkovsky> Xe: that's the 2021 way
[18:59:51] <dminkovsky> the way you described
[18:59:59] <dminkovsky> 2022 coming up soon
[19:00:06] <dminkovsky> will humanity get even crazier

[19:13:33] <gerikson> "wow it's been awhile since I was reminded computer people can be terrible" <finds out about a FreeBSD-derived Mac clone that's against gender neutral pronouns>
[19:13:41] <gerikson> <resets counter to 0>
[19:14:04] <riv> uhhh

[19:14:23] <buttsbot> Twitter - mjg59 - Oh thank goodness there's *finally* a desktop environment for people who don't like gender neutral language https://t.co/lxe8UMihKD
[19:14:31] <dasm> gerikson: is your counter ever going above 0?
[19:14:38] <dasm> *does
[19:14:53] <gerikson> references Snowden, that terrible 'sneak dude, and Apple trying to gender-neutral in German
[19:15:08] <gerikson> dasm: sometimes I am not Extremely Online
[19:15:37] <dasm> ah. so basically "disconnect from the 'society'" and life is better" thing? :)
[19:15:56] <gerikson> I
[19:16:03] <gerikson> m only slightly kidding
[19:16:27] <gerikson> I disconnected from an IRC network because they were basically resetting the counter every other minute
[19:18:52] <dasm> and I'm not kidding at all :D Times when I disconnect from internet are the best times I live.
[19:18:57] <riv> computer people can be horrible, someone is being abusive in arch linux right now
[19:18:58] <dasm> The issue is -- my work relies on internet :/

[19:20:49] <gerikson> that the least attractive part of gemini to me, the implicit gatekeeping
[19:35:21] <indigo> I‚Äôve just accepted that I‚Äôm not cool enough for Gemini
