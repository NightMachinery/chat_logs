[03:20:31] <f-a> winio is fixed, got this from a friend https://www.dropbox.com/s/vfbdsfjcdfef1xp/2.PNG?raw=1
[03:20:34] <f-a> rejoice
[03:22:16] <ManofLetters[m]> \o/
[03:22:54] <f-a> before it would have thrown an exception, this is really great for anyone developing a roguelike

[04:25:39] <EvanR> i can't seem to see these pngs
[04:25:45] <EvanR> 404
[04:26:17] <ManofLetters[m]> I could but can't any more
[04:28:01] <f-a> http://www.ariis.it/link/t/2.png there you have the first
[04:28:37] <f-a> and there the second http://www.ariis.it/link/t/gl.png
[04:30:58] <EvanR> I'm curious what sort of character set you go for
[04:31:14] <EvanR> unicode is not narrowing it down much
[04:33:19] <f-a> suitable blocks are of course latin1 and friends
[04:33:57] <EvanR> like everything in latin1 is fair game? and what friends xD
[04:35:46] <f-a> latin-5 latin-9
[04:36:06] <f-a> yes, fair game. it is displayed correctly and with default settings in linux console
[04:36:17] <f-a> and in cmd.exe as shown by the png
[04:36:57] <EvanR> 3 strange charges missing, but I guess that's a font issue
[05:46:42] <EvanR> er s/charges/chars/
[06:38:33] <EvanR> good lord... GLFW decided that text events (typing A or a or 3 or #) are one kind of event, and anything else (enter, backspace, tab) is not
[06:38:59] <EvanR> in SDL the keydown event may include the character typed, if any
[06:39:54] <EvanR> so to process one relevant stream of text editing events, I gotta merge them somehow
[06:40:08] <EvanR> since it's two entirely separate events in GLFW

[19:50:46] <EvanR> forums posts suggest that they are very separate in windows... which makes me wonder how SDL does it
