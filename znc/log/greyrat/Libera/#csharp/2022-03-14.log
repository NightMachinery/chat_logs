[02:15:01] <lz_> blez: I should come into a random IT company and pretend I've always worked here
[02:15:03] <lz_> maybe it could work
[02:15:34] <lz_> "dude where's my computer"
[02:18:28] <blez> lz_ did you actaully got corona or it was a false alarm
[02:18:46] <lz_> blez: I did just one test which came back negative. maybe it was just allergies
[02:18:59] <lz_> ngl a bit disappointed
[02:19:07] <Nasp> lz_:  "Are you also one of the new ones"
[02:19:16] <Nasp> Was blez  i wanted to highlight
[02:19:28] <lz_> you guys made me think about doing a test btw :)
[02:19:36] <Nasp> Of?
[02:19:54] <lz_> covid
[02:20:03] <Nasp> Ohh
[02:20:07] <Nasp> Self test?
[02:20:16] <lz_> no i went to a center, it took like 15mins
[02:20:30] <Nasp> ahh
[02:20:34] <lz_> the result took quite a long time to come though, so I skipped a sports class while waiting for it
[02:20:41] <Nasp> I think all test centers are closed here
[02:20:52] <Nasp> Or well i think PCr tests are left, bu tquick tests are closed
[02:20:59] <lz_> it's a "normal" center but they also do covid tests for free without appointments
[02:21:07] <lz_> for free if you're vaccinated
[02:21:17] <Nasp> They are all free here
[02:21:27] <Nasp> Not sure i get the benefit of differenting between unvaccinated or not
[02:21:38] <lz_> it's actually the first time I got tested because it's really the first time I thought I could have gotten it
[02:21:45] <Nasp> I wonder what the highest number of test one person have taken
[02:21:52] <Nasp> I remember during 2 months one person have taken like 90 tests or so
[02:22:00] <Suchiman> lz_: i just get online, reserve a test which sends an email that includes a link that will add the test to germany's corona warn app, then you go there, tell them your reserved test id, they swap you and off you go, the results appear in your app automagically after 15~25m
[02:22:02] <Nasp> I think i've done around 10 total
[02:23:13] <lz_> Suchiman: you guys are better at it :)
[02:23:25] <Suchiman> lz_: and if you're positive you automagically alert everyone you've been in contact with anonymously (at least if you agreed to that beforehand)
[02:23:46] <Nasp> you still do contact tracing?
[02:23:59] <Suchiman> Nasp: yes???
[02:24:20] <Suchiman> Nasp: you even get locked up for 10 days at home if you're positive :P
[02:24:44] <Suchiman> which extends to your household members unless they're tripple vaccinated and such
[02:25:00] <lz_> tomorrow we're dropping the masks in most place
[02:25:13] <lz_> eventhough a new covid wave is apparently starting
[02:25:21] <Nasp> Suchiman:  You mean you are home quarantined
[02:25:24] <Nasp> 10 days?
[02:25:27] <Suchiman> yes
[02:25:33] <Nasp> 3-4 days here
[02:25:51] <blez> I'm kinda happy I passed BA.1
[02:25:52] <Nasp> Thought every country had the same strategy
[02:25:58] <blez> maybe "passed" isn't the right word
[02:26:10] <blez> but I hope I've got immunity for BA.2
[02:26:17] <lz_> blez: you caught it?
[02:26:27] <blez> yep, 12 days ago
[02:26:29] <lz_> BA1 doesn't look that bad, esp if vaccinated
[02:26:34] <lz_> that was I was happy to get it
[02:26:39] <Suchiman> BA1? BA2?
[02:26:39] <blez> that's what I thought
[02:26:42] <lz_> would have been like a 4th immunity shot
[02:26:43] <Nasp>  British airways?
[02:26:59] <blez> but I was almost dead for 1 day
[02:27:02] <lz_> Suchiman: ba1 is omicron, ba2 deltacron i think
[02:27:11] <blez> lz_ no
[02:27:20] <lz_> blez: oh ok, I didn't expect it would be bad
[02:27:23] <blez> ba2 is just omicron 2
[02:27:27] <Nasp> Ba1 test?
[02:27:29] <lz_> ok
[02:27:31] <Suchiman> omicron 2, ono
[02:27:32] <blez> it was bad :/
[02:27:44] <blez> my pulse was 120 all day
[02:27:51] <Nasp> blez:  So was mine
[02:27:54] <lz_> blez: can i ask you how old you are?
[02:27:56] <Nasp> And heart palpitations
[02:28:01] <Nasp> It wasn't nice
[02:28:04] <blez> it was like a fever
[02:28:07] <Nasp> Only lasted 3-4 months
[02:28:10] <blez> 34
[02:28:22] <blez> with 2 pfizers
[02:28:26] <lz_> blez: wow, didn't think it could be so bad esp this young
[02:28:36] <lz_> ah maybe your 2nd shot was old then
[02:28:38] <Nasp> I'm 34 and vaccine was bad for me
[02:28:41] <lz_> I got my 3rd shot in december
[02:28:47] <Nasp> I skipped 3rd shot
[02:29:02] <blez> well, my second shot was 9 months ago..
[02:29:02] <lz_> after like 5 months its effect drops a lot
[02:29:35] <blez> but people who wasn't vaccinated got it and they were better
[02:30:16] <blez> I'm fine. But it was bad for a day or two. I got the idea what would it be if I wasn't vaccinated or older. Or not omicron...
[02:30:29] <blez> >not a flu
[02:30:35] <Suchiman> i'm 28, got two biotech's, caught it in february, had one day of headache, coughing and clogged nose for the others. Was negative when i went on the 9th day for another test
[02:30:39] <lz_> blez: https://sciencetaskforce.ch/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fig.2-policubrief.jpg
[02:31:02] <Nasp> Isn't Janssen the one people died from?
[02:31:18] <blez> the real question is... does getting BA.1 get you immunity for BA.2
[02:31:30] <Nasp> What's BA.1?
[02:31:38] <lz_> omicron
[02:31:51] <Nasp> And 2 delta?
[02:31:59] <lz_> no, BA2 came after BA1
[02:32:12] <Suchiman> https://twitter.com/KassandraHeller/status/1381789262496980994 hehehe still good ;>
[02:32:30] <lz_> blez: I think you get some sort of immunity for any covid19 anyway. Omicron had a big reinfection rate, but you still have some sort of protection from previous infections
[02:32:45] <Nasp> Yeah Janssen was the AstraZeneva one right?
[02:32:58] <lz_> no Astrazeneca is another one I think
[02:33:03] <blez> lz_ now the stats are going up again
[02:33:10] <Nasp> Suchiman:  People got a number to call?
[02:33:28] <lz_> blez: yes I've read there's a new wave, that's why it's dumb we're droping the masks in france starting tomorrow
[02:33:55] <Suchiman> Nasp: jansen is the J&J one, the one you only need one dosage of
[02:34:10] <lz_> it's funny because I've read scientists have 0 idea why there's a new wave in europe. They also had no idea when some previous waves stopped etc. it's so weird
[02:34:25] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Ahh okay they are different, just thought it was the same company
[02:34:26] <blez> https://twitter.com/profesterman/status/1501794498225262595
[02:34:28] <blez> ^
[02:35:10] <lz_> blez: well maybe that new wave is ba2 since it's more infectious then
[02:35:18] <Suchiman> blez: well i believe the numbers lol, my dentist got it two days after me, spreading like wildfire
[02:35:34] *** Quits: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[02:35:53] <blez> the real question is.. Do we have immunity at all?
[02:36:13] <Nasp> Or rather is it still dangerous?
[02:36:22] <lz_> blez: I talked with someone who works at sanofi (a french vaccine company), and the answer is yes
[02:36:33] <lz_> blez: partial immunity, but immunity none the less
[02:36:34] <blez> Nasp I guess, not like the original one. But it was nasty
[02:36:44] <lz_> and it gets better every time you catch covid or get vaccinated
[02:36:52] <Nasp> blez:  I heard it was rather harmless now that's why we are supposed to spread it
[02:37:23] <blez> lz_ I know a guy who had delta and still don't have omicron. And he's acting like there's no virus anymore. So, I guess there's some immunity
[02:37:39] <lz_> blez: the drop in efficacy I've shown you a screenshot of, that drop is less important each time your immune system gets a boost
[02:38:03] <blez> lz_ the thing is that people don't want to vaccinate every 3 months
[02:38:23] <blez> in this case the virus is winning the race
[02:38:44] <blez> I just hope it gets more mild and we _have_ some immunity
[02:38:51] <lz_> blez: he told me he's not sure we would even need a 4th dose. maybe not. maybe those 3 are enough and then you catch covid as many times as you want, this helps your immune system anyway
[02:39:14] <Nasp> blez:  How closed is it where you live?
[02:39:15] <blez> remember we have 2019 vaccines. The virus mutates faster
[02:39:18] <lz_> think of an infection as roughly the same as a vaccine shot
[02:39:31] <blez> Nasp what do you mean
[02:39:36] <lz_> blez: it still works well enough
[02:39:46] <Nasp> blez:  Since you say he acts like there's no virus
[02:40:17] <lz_> i'll make you a drawing of what he explained to me
[02:40:27] <blez> Nasp he goes to work every day with open space with 100+ guys
[02:40:52] <Nasp> you still wfh?
[02:41:24] <blez> I do. His company doesn't allow him
[02:41:46] <lz_> here. sorry I didn't put units :) https://i.imgur.com/zIZwOY5.png
[02:42:00] <Nasp> I wonder what winter will bring
[02:42:17] <blez> my idea was that sooner or later, everyone will get it. I just hope that there is some immunity. And it seems to be... at least for some limited time
[02:42:25] <blez> Nasp nukes.
[02:42:33] <Nasp> blez:  If we are lucky
[02:42:54] <lz_> blez: i've read 40% of french got it. I suspect more. + the 85% vaccinated, we're all protected in some way
[02:43:17] <blez> lz_ for now...
[02:43:17] <lz_> also omicron was "only" twice as severe as the flu or something
[02:43:34] <blez> anyway, there a bigger problems nowdays :)
[02:43:37] <lz_> I don't think there's a need to worry anymore, and that's coming from someone who kept worrying about it when others didn't
[02:43:39] <Nasp> I just hope we wont get another lockdown
[02:44:21] <lz_> for countries with a low vaccination rate this is another story. also immunodepressed ppl etc are still at risk
[02:45:15] <Nasp> lz_:  There isn't a need to worry
[02:45:18] <Nasp> Only worry not is Putin
[02:45:29] <lz_> yup
[02:45:38] <Nasp> There havent been much to worry about for months
[02:46:04] <lz_> Nasp: I mean omicron was still bad, we had ~400 deaths a day at its peak here
[02:46:17] <lz_> because it spread like wildfire
[02:46:33] <Nasp> Havent been an issue here for 6 months
[02:47:09] <lz_> Nasp: seems like you had quite a lot of deaths recently https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/denmark
[02:47:22] <lz_> but here they don't report a lot on deaths anymore, maybe it's the same with you
[02:47:36] <Nasp> I haven't seen any reports about that for months
[02:47:49] <lz_> Nasp: news don't report on them but there were still plenty of deaths
[02:48:09] <Nasp> Hmm that those look bad
[02:48:16] <Nasp> I thought most died in 1.st 2nd wave
[02:48:22] <Nasp> There's no talks about further lockdowns
[02:48:35] <lz_> they don't do lockdowns as long as hospitals can manage
[02:48:53] <lz_> doesn't mean people don't die
[02:49:05] <Nasp> They did the last lockdown just for fun
[02:49:18] <Nasp> Was like 95% vaccinated and no pressure on the hospitals
[02:50:09] <lz_> you don't know the pressure on hospitals until it's too late though
[02:50:49] <lz_> a lockdown for omicron would have make sense but they didn't do one here
[02:50:51] <lz_> made*
[02:51:00] <lz_> I self isolated when there were like 500k contaminations a day
[02:51:12] <blez> the govs know they can't stop omicron
[02:51:17] <blez> even with vaccines
[02:51:46] <lz_> yeah lockdowns don't stop waves, they can slow them down which was always the point (except 1st lock down maybe)
[02:51:51] <Nasp> lz_:  Btw those numbers aren't necessarily corona related deaths
[02:51:53] <blez> that's why the whole "pandemic's over" is over the news
[02:52:03] <Nasp> Like if you break a leg and die, and have covid, then it counts as a related death
[02:52:38] <lz_> Nasp: yeah maybe some of those deaths are not due to covid, especially omicron which was less severe on the lungs I heard
[02:53:33] <Nasp> We've learned nothing from this pandemic and are just as horrible prepared for the next one
[02:53:43] <blez> lz_ but does a demage to everything else
[02:54:03] <Nasp> We should make laws for pandemics now, instead of making them up on the spot
[02:54:36] <lz_> Nasp: we already had laws that mandated our country to have mask stocks. They didn't follow them is the problem
[02:55:01] <lz_> at the beginning we had like 1 tenth of what we were supposed to have in stock
[02:55:06] <Nasp> Im thinking like laws and regulatiosn for mask and working from home
[02:55:20] <Nasp> Maybe rules we all agree on before hand
[02:55:38] <Nasp> Here police broke into house if you were more than 10 people
[02:55:43] <Nasp> To avoid such situations
[02:55:53] <lz_> you'd still need to have rules that are adapted to the characteristics of the pandemic, could vary from one to another
[02:59:44] <lz_> 18 million deaths holy smoke https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00708-0
[03:04:02] <Nasp> lz_:  sure but would be a lot easier to prepare now so we dont stand in an unconstitutional situation again
[03:06:04] <lz_> Nasp: what was unconstitutional? here they took exceptional measures, but I think everything was lawful. "state of emergency" things are already covered
[03:06:25] <lz_> on the contrary, there were concerns that they would outlast the pandemic, nobody wants that
[03:07:53] <lz_> in france we probably did lack some tools to force companies into doing remote work though, only thing the gov could do was to "incite" them
[03:08:30] <lz_> I think it became mandatory at some point but it was very late, i admit
[03:10:17] <Nasp> lz_:  We never went to state of emergency
[03:10:27] <lz_> oh? here we did
[03:10:29] <Nasp> So most were just rules made up on the spot enforced by the police
[03:11:11] <Nasp> The most strange part about coming back from WFH is company have grown in size so there isn't even a seat for everyvody
[03:11:40] <lz_> we still are until at least july 31
[03:15:02] <Nasp> Ohh

[12:44:01] <ap5> Nasp, why?
[12:44:24] <ap5> I really like the integrated 2FA :D
[12:44:39] <Nasp> They dont allow saving the password on signup, probably for good reasons buti want to save it in bitwarden
[12:44:53] <ap5> What? I can do that
[12:45:01] <ap5> Sometimes. It depends on the signup form etc
[12:45:10] <Nasp> Yeah
[12:45:18] <Nasp> Some sites don't have forms that does this correctly
[12:45:30] <Nasp> But i had the password in clipboard, entered it into bitwarden
[12:45:40] <Nasp> Had to copy the website and therefor tabbed out to the website
[12:45:47] <Nasp> And in the meantime Bitwarden closed and didn't save it as a draft
[12:45:54] <ap5> :D
[12:45:57] <Nasp> ap5: what 2Fa do you use

[12:46:15] <Nasp> Last week when i tried i accidentially copied a stacktrace since i was debugging
[12:46:20] <Nasp> And forgot i had my password thgere
[12:46:27] <ap5> You can integrate it, so when you sign in and have added 2FA to the site, it copies the token onto the clipboard
[12:46:47] <Nasp> Ahh i have that in Bitwarden as well
[12:46:48] <ap5> So it basically becomes a nobrainer to have 2FA
[12:46:51] <Nasp> Yeah
[12:46:56] <ap5> I like that
[12:47:15] <Nasp> Do you have 2fa on your 1Password?
[12:47:19] <ap5> Yes
[12:47:30] <ap5> You can add it as a one-time password field
[12:47:36] <ap5> an*
[12:47:42] <Nasp> And have it on your phone, accessible?
[12:47:55] <Nasp> I remember with lastpass i had to use the Lastpass 2Fa to access my Lastpass
[12:48:06] <Nasp> So i needed another 2FA app to access lastpass
[12:48:09] <ap5> Lol
[12:48:19] <ap5> I dont have 2FA on the 1password login
[12:48:48] <ap5> I have 2FA on the sites that is in 1password
[12:50:40] <ap5> I have a long password for my 1password - i dont want to have that "a 2fa for the login, so i can get a 2fa for the login, so i can get a 2fa for the 1password"-chain ...

[20:14:03] <JakeSays> it's kind of the whole point

[20:14:17] <bomb> *runs
[20:14:29] <redoc> but touch the ball in the process
[20:14:37] <redoc> no chance you will knock it lose if you never touch it :)
[20:14:43] <bomb> I don't remember if touching was required, but I wasn't the one running with the ball :\
[20:14:59] <JakeSays> bomb: the goal is to capture the ball and run the other direction. grounding it is plan b
[20:15:28] <JakeSays> but since plan a is usually quite difficult, plan b is most often used

[20:31:21] <GunArm> preview version of?  VS?  NET6?
[20:31:25] <GunArm> (no)
[20:31:33] <Diablo-D3> vs
[20:32:25] <Diablo-D3> .net and vs dont have synchronized releases, and you don't need explicit support for 6 in vs for vs to run it
[20:33:19] <GunArm> but VS 2019 preview will include the targetting pack?
[20:33:27] <Diablo-D3> it might
[20:33:49] <JakeSays> i didn't think .net 6 was supported by vs 2019
[20:34:00] <jonp> it isn't
[20:34:05] <jonp> you need VS2022 for .net 6 support
[20:34:05] <Diablo-D3> yeah, isnt it called 2022 now?
[20:34:21] <JakeSays> Diablo-D3: vs 2022 is called 2022

[20:35:40] <jonp> they're all just major version increases

[20:36:17] <JakeSays> Diablo-D3: well, i think few people would consider your view point valid

[20:36:36] <jonp> i don't know how to interpret that?
[20:36:46] <JakeSays> ^
[20:37:05] <jonp> VS2022 supports net6 now, or should support it

[20:37:31] <DoofusCanadensis> well, I'm running the VS2022 for Mac Preview and it does support net6
[20:37:44] <DoofusCanadensis> and since that's come out *after* VS2022...
[20:38:14] <JakeSays> when it comes to version support rider is much better than vs
[20:38:31] <GunArm> hm ok.  just surprised it's not in the installer yet.  not that I can only install things through the installer.  I just throught I was being a good boy doing it that way

[22:14:41] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: what if instead of gps, it was a cellular device? surely that would prove ownership
[22:15:34] <MatthiasVance> Depends on what you mean by cellular JakeSays
[22:15:45] <MatthiasVance> It has a SIM card (if you opt for the insurance package)
[22:16:23] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: i have these little cellular modules that i use with MCU's, etc.
[22:16:50] <MatthiasVance> I read that some people just put an Apple tag somewhere to have it make a noise
[22:16:51] <JakeSays> they're basically just the modem bits from a phone
[22:17:22] <MatthiasVance> Ah yeah it already has that internally, the problem is that if it's in an enclosed space (you can't see it) the police can't do much
[22:17:32] <MatthiasVance> Especially if the GPS is meh
[22:18:06] <DoofusCanadensis> serial number on the GPS isn't enough?
[22:18:12] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: yeah but this is a cellular modem, so you have all the location stuff + data
[22:18:28] <MatthiasVance> 100% sure that's what they have
[22:18:29] <JakeSays> so enclosed spaces aren't an ssue
[22:18:33] <MatthiasVance> ahh
[22:18:34] <JakeSays> ah
[22:18:35] <MatthiasVance> hm
[22:18:46] <MatthiasVance> They do OTA updates when you select that package
[22:18:59] <JakeSays> you're only limited to areas with cell coverage
[22:19:02] <MatthiasVance> I think the main issue is: Have it make a sound, and they have nothing to do that
[22:19:14] <MatthiasVance> And I think that's shitty for a EUR 2750 device
[22:19:20] <JakeSays> holy shit
[22:19:31] <MatthiasVance> Yes that's an e-bike to you
[22:19:39] <JakeSays> damn
[22:19:40] <MatthiasVance> Of decent quality
[22:19:48] <JakeSays> so why is a sound required?
[22:20:04] <MatthiasVance> To give the police probable cause for breaking something
[22:20:29] <JakeSays> location alone isn't enough?
[22:20:58] <MatthiasVance> Well, depends I guess on how close other things are in the proximity
[22:21:05] <JakeSays> because if it's making a sound then the dude who stole it can silence it, etc
[22:21:09] <MatthiasVance> In the cases I read those were in busy places or something
[22:21:16] <MatthiasVance> Yeah true
[22:21:53] <JakeSays> although if done right you should be able to activate the sound on command, so you could activate it just as the police arrive

[22:48:55] <merced> i think hp or oracle offered some kind of vm hypervisor but it cost more than just buying 100 new blades
[22:49:15] <ki9a> hah
[22:49:19] <ki9a> well oracle...
[22:49:25] <JakeSays> didn't oracle just lose a lawsuit over itanium?
[22:49:39] <merced> https://www.theregister.com/2021/09/30/oracle_loses_itanium_appeal/
[22:49:41] <JakeSays> iirc it was because they stopped supporting itanium and hp sued them
[22:49:43] <merced> lmfao yes
[22:49:44] <JakeSays> yeah that's it
[22:54:36] <ki9a> Is winmd what we'll be using in the future instead of .h files?
[22:54:49] <JakeSays> no
[22:55:28] <ki9a> because winui doesn't seem to have headers
[22:55:32] <ki9a> but it does have winmd files
[22:55:38] <ki9a> winui3
[22:56:02] <JakeSays> aren't winmd files just type information?
[22:56:12] <JakeSays> i thought they were only for interop
[22:56:36] <ki9a> yeah com classes basically
[22:56:49] <merced> thats dirty
[22:57:28] <jonp> why is that dirty?
[22:57:30] <jonp> .h files are dirty
[22:57:47] <JakeSays> headers aren't dirty
[22:58:05] <ki9a> headers are nasty to parse
[22:58:24] <jonp> you need to be a C/C++ compiler to parse header files properly
[22:58:30] <jonp> .winmd/IL is much easier to deal with
[22:59:03] <JakeSays> well, yes, compilers are very good at parsing.. source code
[22:59:23] <jonp> if you're writing a non-C compiler, needing to parse .h files is a big ask.
[23:00:03] <JakeSays> you just use a C/c++compiler to parse them

[23:00:39] <JakeSays> not sure why you'd want a non-C compiler to parse C source
[23:01:29] <jonp> suppose you wanted to easily automate creating Objective-C method signatures for C# P/Invoke / objc_msgSend() purposes ;-)
[23:01:39] <jonp> …and all you really have there is a .h file.
[23:02:00] <JakeSays> i would expect a tool to do that for me, not a c# compiler :p
[23:02:01] <jonp> so you need an entire compiler toolchain just to parse a header file in order to get what you *really* want: an ABI signature and selector name.
[23:02:11] <jonp> i'm not saying the C# compiler
[23:02:15] <jonp> but the tool would need to do that, sure.
[23:02:27] <jonp> and writing that tool becomes really complicated.
[23:02:34] <JakeSays> right, so the tool should be based on a c compiler
[23:02:35] <jonp> as opposed to just parsing IL
[23:02:39] <JakeSays> best tool for the job, etc
[23:02:47] <jonp> llvm is not "small", as they say.
[23:03:01] <JakeSays> that's fine
[23:03:12] <ki9a> it's not JUST the compiler though
[23:03:20] <ki9a> you also need the headers, the exact right ones
[23:03:25] <ki9a> and the set of magic defines
[23:03:29] <JakeSays> it's actually not the compiler at all - it's the parser :p
[23:03:36] <ki9a> I have a c parser btw
[23:03:38] <jonp> and "the headers" includes headers provided by the OS
[23:03:42] <ki9a> it's still a pain
[23:03:47] <jonp> so you can't actually be self-contained or consistent
[23:03:52] <jonp> anything & everything could change
[23:04:13] <JakeSays> well, it's the nature of things.
[23:04:26] <JakeSays> if you dont want that overhead, then don't use c++

[23:04:36] <ki9a> it's not about overhead
[23:04:53] <ki9a> it's often the only api spec an os has
[23:05:08] <JakeSays> ki9a: that's overhead - intellectual overhead
[23:05:22] <JakeSays> but you can't blame the language because the OS has shitty docs
[23:05:36] <merced> i just blame microsoft and be done with i
[23:05:42] <ki9a> osx is worse...
[23:05:53] <ki9a> you also have to support objc and soon: swift.
[23:05:55] <merced> idk apple's documentation is pretty thorough
[23:05:58] <ki9a> no it's not
[23:06:08] <JakeSays> merced: not at the lower levels
[23:06:19] <ki9a> it's of the quality: (-) BOOL isEnabled: True if this control is enabled.
[23:06:24] <merced> oh, didnt know which we were talking about lmao
[23:06:26] <jonp> and $DEITY help you when it comes to the Swift ABI
[23:06:44] <ki9a> swift's abi is whatever the swift compiler happens to emit
[23:07:02] <merced> back to cosmos
[23:07:04] <merced> zzz
[23:07:21] <ki9a> apple threw away the posix level docs last time I checked
[23:07:34] <ki9a> so the only api docs is objc level and higher
