But flow implies information moves at a finite speed, because if it moved instantly flow wouldn't be able to retain state (no delay). Ergo, speed C.

[00:08:15] <Decker> ProfSimm maybe consider a broader scope of possible systems that might be modeled; I have a history of a relationship with Union Carbide Chemical; they have these huge sprawling refineries of various processes - yes mostly it's shuttling stuff from place to place, but sometimes there's merges that produces new types/streams... but within a process it might have several steps

[00:34:46] <ProfSimm> Decker: the problem is that it's a property "between" two nodes. 
[00:35:03] <ProfSimm> Decker: we can model it as property of the first node in unidirectional link from first to second node
[00:35:13] <Decker> with a lot of overhead you can generalize that structure so some outside operator can view them easier, without knowing specific objects and what they specifically have for a relation to other things (how they implemented it, or what specific methods on a node they need to use to get the relations)
[00:35:32] <node1> nomagno for example?

[00:36:36] <Decker> Is it worth the generalization in the end?  I'm not so sure... I had abstract lists of entities for an inventory system and relation to other nodes - it was fairly general, even though you could really only hold one thing, it has a list of things that might be in the hand object
[00:36:41] <nomagno> That is, the REMAINDER of dividing 6 by two is zero

[01:16:06] <vdamewood> Now I need to figure out which will result in more downloads, testing my server deployment scripts while installing updates from public repos, or making my own local repo mirrors.
[01:16:14] <ProfSimm> Decker: don't you find it appealing to edit a big software project the equivalent of millions of lines of C code, as two flat tables.
[01:16:22] <ProfSimm> Decker: , I think it's an interesting idea ;-)
[01:16:31] <vdamewood> Private Repos will be about 48 Gigs of downloads.
[01:16:48] <ProfSimm> Decker: I mean... I guess millions of lines of code is also a table of bytes in the end.
[01:16:58] <ProfSimm> Decker: but hopefully the table rep is more insightful
[01:17:09] <Decker> there have been many code analysis tools - some that were really pretty good that have mostly gone away over the years
[01:17:24] <node1> What's autoconf?
[01:17:31] <ProfSimm> Decker: what is the lesson, we don't wanna analyze our code?
[01:17:39] <node1> I have seen many C  project uses it for compilations
[01:17:44] <vdamewood> node1: A tool to generate build scripts.
[01:18:01] <node1> yes it's very hard to backtrack the code into it
[01:18:42] <vdamewood> As far as I care, autoconf is pretty much obsolete.
[01:18:45] <node1> It's makefile is huge big lines of code, once upon a time i dare to backtrack the makefile and i just loose my hope
[01:18:47] <Decker> ProfSimm I dunno... it ends up never really being the tree you think it is?  I guess an ide like hexrays might be close; at least you end up with a single source of truth for function names, and you rename the function and all other references auto update
[01:19:06] <Decker> but that's for taking somethng existing and indexing it not making new things
[01:19:26] <vdamewood> node1: Autoconf doesn't make big Makefiles. Automake does.
[01:20:08] <Decker> without knowing what inputs you're actually getting to functions you can't build an effective run-graph... you end up graphing all the failure and catch paths which are probably never goingt to get hit, and are just there to satisfy coverage tests
[01:20:08] <ProfSimm> Decker: what bothers me about trees is that they're super neat but they're a lie. AST + variables = graph
[01:20:10] <node1> Might be it's automake.
[01:20:19] <beaky> i like autotools the longest part of the build is always the ./configure script 
[01:20:33] <vdamewood> node1: they are often used together.

[02:13:25] <Decker> unless you know how to release all that memory you now have mapped
[02:13:27] <epony> it's also weight on time, and you compensage the wasted space with processing around

[02:13:49] <epony> there is the fuller evaluation that has to happen for assessment of the cost
[02:13:54] <ProfSimm> The whole idea behind COW is to NOT duplicate areas that are the same.

[02:19:07] <bjs> Decker: Copy-on-Write means two programs can read the same memory without actually copying the memory.  Once one of them needs to write to it, then it must be copied.
[02:19:09] <ProfSimm> Decker: to say "don't copy" means to not understand at all why independent snapshot was needed in the first place
[02:19:36] <ProfSimm> Decker: what happens if you don't copy and two processes now are tweaking each other's memory. 
[02:19:39] <Decker> bjs yes, there's still a managment overhead of that memory - and surely if you use it that's great, but what about when you don't ?

[02:20:55] <bjs> Decker: if you don't read or write it, then no memory gets copied.  This is how Linux works when it makes a new process

[02:21:44] <ProfSimm> Decker: the idea is values are passed by copy. This gets expensive for large values, and COW fixes that problem.
[02:22:17] <ProfSimm> Decker: it's identical to "persistent data structures" in FP, but without the ceremony. You work with values as if they're full copies, but they mostly share the same memory
[02:22:30] <Decker> who passes values and finds value in doing such?
[02:22:37] <bjs> Decker: inside Linux is a bit of data (maybe a couple MB in the worst case) that says how all of memory is chopped up for that process, what parts are read-only and what parts are writeable. This is the management Linux needs to do for processes.
[02:22:46] <bjs> a bit of data for each process*
[02:22:52] <ProfSimm> Decker: it's essential in a whole class of models, like Actor system for example (think Erlang)

[02:39:04] <bjs> Decker: im not sure what you're trying to argue.
[02:39:38] <ProfSimm> The problem is that modifying things by reference is very narrow and very fragile.

[02:41:28] <Decker> ProfSimm the other option is don't copy things :)
[02:42:01] <ProfSimm> The point here is 1) if you move it you don't copy it 2) if it's immutable, you don't copy it 3) if you share it and read it, you don't copy it 4) if you share it and write it, you don't copy ALL of it, but only the modified part
[02:42:17] <ProfSimm> How can we have a system literally designed to REDUCE and ELIMINATE copying, and you all complain about copying?
[02:42:46] <Decker> right - seeems like a lot todo about nothing
[02:42:46] <ProfSimm> It's like not understanding what COW is
[02:43:10] <ProfSimm> Decker: you literally don't have to do anything.
[02:43:57] <ProfSimm> COW is not manual, it's automatic
[02:44:21] <bjs> Decker: what are you trying to argue exactly?  it's not very clear
[02:44:42] <ProfSimm> bjs: I've the feeling there's just some meme going around to hate COW for some reason
[02:45:19] <Decker> I'm not hating on it; I'm hating on the logic that thinks it's nessecary or good that it is a thing
[02:45:54] <ProfSimm> So you don't hate it you just hate others don't hate it. OK
[02:46:04] <bjs> Decker: the point here is that in Unix-y systems you have a fork() operation which turns 1 process into 2 that are supposed to be identical copies of one-another.
[02:46:18] <bjs> Decker: if you dislike CoW because of the Copy part, then it's not really CoW you dislike but fork()
[02:46:20] <Decker> the whole idea that passing values is in general a great idea is flawed

[02:47:12] <duuude> lol
[02:47:17] <ProfSimm> Decker: can you express what's the flaw exactly
[02:47:50] <Decker> because you get extra copies - more notable if someone writes something to 1 and none of the others update
[02:48:05] <Decker> that it manages to do that efficiently is beside the point

[02:49:07] <epony> that's the real dramatic problem, most of computing is going towards the needs of big data storage pools and machines, and you pay the price for extra weight in case you adopt that prematurely before your hardware and finances are ready for that

[05:51:11] <pikapika> It is a wrong analogy
[05:51:19] <pikapika> It would work if you replaced games with hpc a bit better
[05:52:12] <pikapika> HPC is an intended use case of GPUs, and while I'd prefer the hpc to be for scientic computation etc, it cannot be claimed crypto is not a kind of hpc itself
[05:53:19] <FloridaMan> I mean, computers were never "meant" to be used for games at all in the first place, but things evolve and more use cases are created.

[08:16:29] <blahboybaz> I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone or something.. I'm trying to find the aspect ratio of s screen size (360 x 800) and what I'm getting isn't corroborated by other sources. [1]: I have never heard of a 16:7 aspect ratio as being anything commone out there.. [2]: I can not find any article or documentation on a 16:7 aspect ratio.. [3]: But 16:7 is what an online calculator gives me (and what 
[08:16:35] <blahboybaz> SEEMS to be the right answer - the answer makes sense mathematically).. [4]: In addition to all that I can't find any reference to a 360 x 800 screen size except the source I got it from to begin with (ie: no corroboration) - however I consider the original source to be highly reliable --> https://gs.statcounter.com/screen-resolution-stats/mobile/worldwide

[08:38:07] <blahboybaz> I'm starting to wonder what practices designers have for approaching their design. What made sense to me (what seemed intuitive) was to design for aspect ratios - pick the couple most common and design for them - then use screen sizes as break point to decide when to use a mobile vs. desktop layout. So the desing itself would have like 2 layouts X a few aspect ratios. Now I'm wondering what the 
[08:38:13] <blahboybaz> most reliable source of aspect ratio and screen size data is.  Do designers just pick a certain company to go with (eg: iphone or samsung or somthing else) and just design for that and call it good?

[13:38:50] <davros> his basic point is... it's worse than that,  it's all about pumping crypto generally its critical to their whole plan to "financialise every micro level interaction", and if they suceed we end up in a dystopia where this all becomes compulsory eg to interact with anyone else in law etc

[14:16:42] <pyzozord> davros: not really, a game designer is simply a person who designs levels / game mechanics. A psychologist with something educated in psychology. We meant the latter
[14:16:56] <davros> a certain type of game designer, i should ay
[14:16:59] <davros> say^
[14:17:23] <davros> the person at the top of the designer tree who has the final say on this is the one who is trusted to do that psychology
[14:17:34] <pyzozord> there can be a psychologist who is also a game designer, but I rather assume psychologists are hired as consultants for the game designers
[14:17:35] <davros> i.e. "i know what will keep players coming back"
[14:17:49] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[14:18:12] <davros> i know what you're saying r.e. "hiring psychologists" but i dont think psychologists academically trained would have the insight into the right kind of psychology,
[14:18:19] <pyzozord> I wouldn't call that psychology no more than trying to get your friend to do something for you
[14:18:22] <davros> i think many fields involve "domain specific psychology"
[14:18:25] <shiit> from the perspective of designer and user playability and playable are different things 
[14:18:46] <pyzozord> but well it's semantics, nvm
[14:19:00] <davros> kind of like how there's a discipline of "mathematician" but engineers, physicicts, economists all have their own applied maths
[14:19:12] <davros> right pyzozord i dont want to start a semantic argument :)
[14:19:21] <davros> what i should say is
[14:19:43] <davros> "a sucessful game designer must have an intuitive grasp of the subset of psychology relevant to this"
[14:20:44] <davros> its their responsibility to figure out the difference between the developpers/design team making the game *they* want to play, vs the game *customers* want to play
[14:20:49] <pyzozord> for sure it's part of the thing, I was just saying we were talking about hiring officially educated/licensed psychologists
[14:21:00] <davros> yeah fair enough

[15:41:45] <phogg> cool but impractical. As soon as you try and view the code anywhere outside your fancy editor everything falls over, and half the problem with the indent war is that any two people might have different ideas of what is correct. This is just another incompatible solution.

[17:59:08] <mishugana> it doesn't, and the language keeps looking till `no`?
[17:59:20] <ProfSimm> mishugana: statements are like bullet points precedes by #. A statement is terminated by source end, or the next # at its indentation level
[17:59:51] <ProfSimm> So basically it's like semicolons, but before a statement, not after it

[18:00:51] <ProfSimm> It's more dynamic than others I guess. But you can fold a lot of those expressions before runtime and optimize them statically

[20:57:51] <bjs> a function with type `Maybe a -> a`, without any other constraints, really would have to be partial

[21:13:27] <pyzozord> I don't really want to run it natively on my machine, I'd need to set up php mysql and all kinds of crap

[21:14:08] <FloridaMan> it's never going to be
