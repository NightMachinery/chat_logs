[00:06:17] <Roey> the painting depicts Nadezhda Krupskaya (Lenin's wife) naked in bed with Leon Trotsky. One guest asks, "But this is a travesty! Where is Lenin?"

[02:14:43] <Shinra> why are they selling that shit in UK lol
[02:14:49] <Bco1981> omero: those custom it yourself gets expensive fast.
[02:15:27] <Bco1981> omero: but ocoursem you can get it like you want it.
[02:15:37] <Bco1981> ofcourse,
[02:17:23] <Bco1981> suddenly this last one i bought... just 2 weeks ago... seem better.
[02:20:05] <Bco1981> omero: lol wow wtf.
[02:20:59] <omero> check the other models too, Bco1981 ...
[02:21:12] <Bco1981> "Concept" ...? not available for order ?
[02:21:30] <omero> eh, I think they produce based on orders... 
[02:21:59] <omero> not sure about your budget, mine couldnt afford those :P
[02:22:44] <Bco1981> i could probably afford it... but... a bit too futuristic for my daily use. :D
[02:22:57] <omero> I linked as an example.. a few weeks ago, my trusted old mechanical keyboard suffered an "accident"
[02:23:23] <omero> I had it for like 20+ years
[02:23:53] <Bco1981> mine wasn't that old yet, just about 16 i think
[02:24:34] <Bco1981> not mechincal, and the tab-key was getting hard to press if i didn't hit it dead center.
[02:24:35] <omero> the keys didnt even have symbols on it anymore, but I didnt care... I can type in the blind on several layouts
[02:26:32] <omero> while sipping some tea, one of my cats suddenly jumped on my desk and nudged the cup with a trick of her tail 
[02:26:35] <omero> lol
[02:27:34] <omero> I immediately took action ... and I thought all was fine for a few hours ... then the space bar stopped working.
[02:27:41] <omero> one cannot live without the space
[02:28:27] <omero> thus I had to replace the whole keyboard :/
[02:29:01] <omero> that's how I found those 'custom' models ... I was intrigued of course

[08:19:36] <MootPoot> I guess I could finish monster instead
[08:21:05] <emmeka> look to like Clannad you have to like 2 things. 1) tearjerkers 2) archetypal school life VN plots
[08:22:18] <MootPoot> hmm
[08:22:25] <Shinra> I remember it was the fuuko arc that actually impacted on me more than the latter one
[08:22:29] <emmeka> if neither of those are up your alley, you're probably not going to really enjoy it. but the payoff is worth it, imo, and the early arcs aren't bad.
[08:22:35] <MootPoot> I'm like 50/50 on both of those things
[08:22:40] <MootPoot> I dont really go seeking them
[08:22:45] <MootPoot> but I dont hate them either
[08:22:47] <Shinra> I didn't cry at the ending but I did for fuuko
[08:24:09] <emmeka> Shinra I think it's a good one, and it sets the tone.
[08:24:24] <emmeka> I didn't cry for Fuuko, but I did like the arc
[08:24:41] <Shinra> and I just loved Kotomi
[08:25:06] <emmeka> MootPoot this is probably a good test, just watch Fuuko's arc to completion, and if you don't like it then you probably won't like the entirety of Clannad.

[08:28:40] <ButterNoodle> trails any good?
[08:28:58] <ButterNoodle> yea clannad is shit
[08:29:10] <ButterNoodle> afterstory is a masterpiece tho
[08:29:44] <MootPoot> trails are pretty decently kept
[08:29:47] <MootPoot> although they are short
[08:29:55] <MootPoot> the longest one in the area is like 4.5km
[08:30:14] <MootPoot> then the next step up is like a 25km one around an entire lake
[08:30:23] <emmeka> if Clannad had actually ended with season 1 I probably would've given it a 6.5/10. It's endearing, it's nice, but nothing about it stands out exceptionally. It feels very much like a lot of other series from the same era.
[08:30:23] <ButterNoodle> nice
[08:30:26] <MootPoot> I dont have it in me to do that, I just did the all the smaller ones
[08:30:45] <ButterNoodle> I did one of those ~20km jobbies
[08:30:48] <MootPoot> Then I tested out equipment loads while hiking
[08:30:54] <MootPoot> weight really fucks you in the asss
[08:30:55] <ButterNoodle> fucking almost killed me
[08:31:01] <ButterNoodle> yes
[08:31:13] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: yep.. nothing special
[08:31:15] <MootPoot> I was running a 15kg pack plus my clothes
[08:31:21] <ButterNoodle> I mean the 2nd 1/2 was good
[08:31:36] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: you would never travel w that much unless ur doing multi day
[08:31:36] <MootPoot> 5km in total but like 2 were uphill
[08:31:39] <MootPoot> fuckin died
[08:32:06] <emmeka> but Clannad is good when you add the context of it all being buildup to Afterstory
[08:32:12] <MootPoot> I could do 20km in a single go if I had no plans to stay the night; and only had my phone and water on me
[08:32:14] <ButterNoodle> I did 15km with a mis-weighed pack and wanted to die 1/2 way in
[08:32:19] <MootPoot> would take a while
[08:32:26] <emmeka> as a whole, the series is fantastic, and it wouldn't be as fantastic without that long buildup
[08:32:37] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: fax... I recommend the entire series.. never just clannad
[08:33:04] <ButterNoodle> its essential watching.. like bebop, or akira
[08:33:05] <emmeka> yeah, and you can't just watch Afterstory, because then it doesn't have impact

[08:44:11] <ButterNoodle> real estate everywhere makes no sense
[08:44:32] <emmeka> yeah but Canadian real estate did the same things as US real estate, but on steroids.
[08:44:33] <MootPoot> brah
[08:44:33] <ButterNoodle> everything went 1.5-2x its value in a few months

[08:46:43] <ButterNoodle> 400K for how big?

[08:47:18] <emmeka> that's what your ass cheeks are for... nature's padding
[08:47:30] <ButterNoodle> for 400K it better be 90sqm
[08:47:50] <ButterNoodle> at least
[08:48:05] <Sadale> same. In fact most cost 600K+ here. 400K is rather low-end.
[08:48:14] <Sadale> lol
[08:48:20] <ButterNoodle> but thats like nyc costs..
[08:48:40] <ButterNoodle> imagine buying an apartment in nyc..
[08:48:48] <emmeka> ButterNoodle one thing that's real nice up in these parts is that outside of actual towns/cities, most land is in "unorganized townships". And there's no counties up here either. In unorganized township, there's no municipal government of any sort, and therefore no municipal taxes or zoning laws or any sort of by-laws.
[08:49:02] <Sadale> I'm not sure on its exact price. But the one I'm living in is 600K+ and it's only 30sqm :-(

[08:51:04] <emmeka> pretty factual statement though
[08:51:27] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: I was actually looking at buying when I had taken a job there.. they were in the 200-300K range for 30-40sqm
[08:51:34] <ButterNoodle> higher end also
[08:51:39] <Sadale> wow. It's cheaper there then.

[08:57:09] <ButterNoodle> #metoo
[08:57:16] <ButterNoodle> they are
[08:57:19] <emmeka> 14 was the age of consent, when I was 14.
[08:57:40] <MootPoot> emmeka here single handedly defining the age of consent to whatever he is
[08:57:48] <emmeka> they've changed it, now, I think it's 16 with exceptions made for 14/15 year olds and someone up to 5 years their elder.
[08:58:10] <ButterNoodle> so 16/21 is legal?
[08:58:11] <MootPoot> can we make the age of consent like
[08:58:11] <ButterNoodle> tf
[08:58:13] <MootPoot> 30
[08:58:14] <emmeka> MootPoot no I mean literally. when I was 14, the age of consent in this country was 14 years old. they changed it during the Harper years.
[08:58:22] <MootPoot> people are too dumb to seks
[08:58:41] <MootPoot> have govt issued sexbots instead
[08:58:42] <emmeka> ButterNoodle 16/anything is legal.
[08:58:48] <emmeka> 16 is the current age of consent here.
[08:58:54] <ButterNoodle> wow
[08:59:08] <emmeka> and, until recently, that was 14.
[08:59:31] <MootPoot> I need to get better at code
[08:59:32] <MootPoot> I suck
[08:59:40] <emmeka> before you get any ideas, it is a crime in both of our countries to travel to another jursidiction to have sex with a minor, and our government used to actually bust Americans for this a lot.
[08:59:49] <MootPoot> lul really

[09:00:20] <MootPoot> I'd risk it for a slim jim

[09:01:27] <emmeka> but I don't think there was an overlap between the time period of 14 being the age of consent and brothels being legal.
[09:01:32] <emmeka> so there's that I guess.

[09:10:56] <MootPoot> my fire is really smoky again
[09:11:00] <MootPoot> even though it has plenty of air
[09:11:08] <ButterNoodle> u put too much wood in it
[09:11:15] <emmeka> oh lol this is amazing. I just looked up why that was a thing. turns out it's because when they legalized homosexuality in 1969 (nice) there was still a law on the books against *heterosexual* anal sex. So they just ammended that law and added an exemption for people over 18.
[09:11:35] <ButterNoodle> DunceCotus: yes I want to see gay girl do gay things, and explore themselves
[09:11:47] <ButterNoodle> *the sex year
[09:12:05] <emmeka> this law was later ammended to remove any specifics about the genders involved in the buttfucking, and so it stayed on the books
[09:12:17] <ButterNoodle> yea thats buttfucked
[09:12:20] <MootPoot> I named a moth sitting next to my laptop emmeka, then that moth proceeded to fly head on into my campfire and pull an icarus
[09:12:34] <MootPoot> I think this might have something to do with the human emmeka's future
[09:12:36] <MootPoot> probably
[09:12:43] <MootPoot> thats what the natives do right

[09:15:12] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: who doesn't
[09:15:40] <emmeka> DunceCotus it was very silly yes. Nonsensical that throughout my own teenage years, a 30 year old could legally knock up a 14 year old girl, but a 17 year old and an 18 year old can't do anything that'd give a fujoshi a nosebleed
[09:15:49] <emmeka> but hey, that's the law for you
[09:16:18] <DunceCotus> the law isn't there to protect people
[09:16:20] <MootPoot> It seems like the amount of smoke coming from my fire is directly related to the amount of bark being burned
[09:16:22] <DunceCotus> its there to control bodies
[09:16:23] <MootPoot> at any one time
[09:18:14] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: controlled burn-off?

[09:55:31] <emmeka> JesseDesu 12,000 years ago the land on which I stand was covered by a kilometer of ice and the oceans so low that Eurasia and North America were connected. 50 million years ago, the earth was so hot that the arctic ocean was open freshwater dominated by ferns and sea turtles.
[09:58:31] <emmeka> the earth is currently in an ice age state, which is actually rare over geological timescales. we think of current changes as extreme. but they are only extreme in their pace, not in their form. 
[09:59:38] <emmeka> the world is not going to end just because we humans feel like accelerating processes that work against us
[10:00:22] <JesseDesu> so you deny global warming

[10:08:08] <MootPoot> but will we be deaded
[10:08:56] <emmeka> things can be bad without them causing human extinction, and shouting about the end of days is neither helpful or factual

[10:49:30] <MootPoot> boring characters

[10:50:20] <JesseDesu> or what was it
[10:50:24] <emmeka> MootPoot idk what's boring about them. Eru Chitanda is a very memorable character, at the very least.
[10:50:32] <JesseDesu> the girl with the blood sword coming out of her hand
[10:50:40] <MootPoot> oh, you loved that other show I told you
[10:50:45] <emmeka> I just like the way she moves. She's animated in a kind of unique, twitchy way.
[10:50:45] <MootPoot> I forgot the name
[10:50:51] <MootPoot> I think that was underratted
[10:50:59] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: remember the girl with the kombini store manager
[10:51:01] <MootPoot> what was it called
[10:51:17] <JesseDesu> after the rain?
[10:51:19] <MootPoot> ye
[10:51:26] <JesseDesu> i loved that show
[10:51:30] <MootPoot> that one had a boring premise
[10:51:36] <MootPoot> but 10/10 execution
[10:51:38] <JesseDesu> wish it had more ecchi
[10:51:38] <MootPoot> imo
[10:51:42] <JesseDesu> but its ok
[10:51:42] <MootPoot> nah
[10:51:45] <MootPoot> ecchi would have ruined it
[10:51:51] <JesseDesu> not for me
[10:52:07] <MootPoot> well
[10:52:10] <MootPoot> not *ruined*
[10:52:11] <JesseDesu> maybe someone made some doujin 
[10:52:17] <MootPoot> but it wouldnt have added anything either
[10:52:53] <emmeka> JesseDesu personally I'd say Hyouka is actually one of the better KyoAni series, and nobody really cares about it for some reason. It's pretty unique, or was in its time.
[10:53:06] <JesseDesu> what is it about actually
[10:53:13] <MootPoot> its about an airheaded girl
[10:53:19] <MootPoot> annoying a dude into doing stuff
[10:53:24] <JesseDesu> nice
[10:53:35] <emmeka> JesseDesu  Imagine Haruhi but you remove everything supernatural, give Kyon 200 more IQ, and change Haruhi from a tsundere into a prim and proper but bubbly girl
[10:53:39] <MootPoot> fuck; my last log is almost gone
[10:53:40] <JesseDesu> i like smart girls tho
[10:53:42] <JesseDesu> better
[10:53:52] <MootPoot> only the embers...
[10:54:01] <JesseDesu> whats a bubbly girl
[10:54:03] <MootPoot> the embers of freenode are burning in my campfire
[10:54:03] <JesseDesu> a fatty?
[10:54:11] <MootPoot> JesseDesu:  bubble tits
[10:54:12] <emmeka> I wouldn't say she's airheaded, she's just... well, curious.
[10:54:13] <MootPoot> and ass
[10:54:21] <JesseDesu> ok
[10:54:25] <JesseDesu> i'll give it a watch
[10:55:29] <emmeka> the thing that I remember the most about that anime is the ending, which is really nice if open-ended, and the way they animated Eru Chitanda. She just sort of moves in a unique way that suits her personality well.
[10:55:43] <MootPoot> ok
[10:55:46] <MootPoot> fucko's arc is ended
[10:55:51] <MootPoot> I give it a 6.5/10
[10:56:04] <JesseDesu> hey fucko
[10:56:22] <emmeka> MootPoot and what did I say earlier.
[10:56:35] <JesseDesu> i'm acquiring hyouka at a rate of 3mb/sec
[10:56:37] <MootPoot> something about global warming?
[10:56:41] <JesseDesu> should be done in 40 minutes
[10:56:51] <emmeka> <emmeka> if Clannad had actually ended with season 1 I probably would've given it a 6.5/10. It's endearing, it's nice, but nothing about it stands out exceptionally. It feels very much like a lot of other series from the same era.
[10:56:57] <emmeka> <emmeka> but Clannad is good when you add the context of it all being buildup to Afterstory

[16:06:27] <AmalLight> education is important
[16:06:34] <iloveyou> I don't think shinto came from buddhism at all
[16:07:01] <AmalLight> especially if you isolate your country from foreigners for a few hundred years -- sad but yes

[16:08:22] <Cryowolf> ah I think I got it now
[16:08:37] <Cryowolf> Similar to how they turned Scandinavian Pagans into Christianity
[16:09:09] <Cryowolf> they adopted some of the ways and tried to lure them in that way and then this and that happened. Off-shoots here and there occured until there was a "winner"
[16:09:18] <iloveyou> still, they don't change buddhists in anime into christians because they want to show the anime in a mainly christian country
[16:09:38] <iloveyou> they certainly change the language however
[16:09:43] <Cryowolf> and that became Shinto, which had its own ways of thinking with some buddhist ways
[16:09:43] <amigojapan> Thanks AmalLight 
[16:10:03] <AmalLight> amigojapan it's make a lot of sounds but it is good
[16:10:07] <AmalLight> interesting
[16:10:08] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I am watching mushoku tensei
[16:10:17] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, cool
[16:10:20] <Cryowolf> what do you think?
[16:10:35] <iloveyou> amigojapan, did you already finish flying witch?
[16:10:47] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I like it besides him being a perv
[16:10:48] <Cryowolf> It's very focused on more real aspects of what a person would do
[16:10:58] <amigojapan> iloveyou: not yet
[16:11:16] <Cryowolf> he kinda grows out of that a bit, but he recognizes that it doesn't fit a childs behavior
[16:11:23] <Cryowolf> but he's an adult in a child
[16:11:32] <AmalLight> they certainly change the language however -- yes this is doing for meet stupid consumers we are iloveyou
[16:11:34] <Cryowolf> so it becomes a dilemma for him, obviously
[16:11:51] <Cryowolf> what episode are you on amigojapan?
[16:12:31] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: episode 9
[16:12:44] <Cryowolf> so the shit has hit the fan then? ^^
[16:12:52] <AmalLight> *yes they are doing for meet the stupid consumers we are
[16:12:56] <Cryowolf> very suddenly, out of nowhere
[16:13:27] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: some kind of magic wave. And he talked to a God
[16:13:32] <Cryowolf> and without doing the whole "The MC now gains a super power and understands everything and saves the day"
[16:13:50] <Cryowolf> yeh
[16:14:24] <Cryowolf> I dunno about s2 (Oct 4) but in season 1 there's very few isekai stereotypes regarding powers
[16:14:40] <Cryowolf> he's not super powerful, he's had to practice all his life
[16:14:58] <amigojapan> I see Cryowolf 
[16:15:09] <amigojapan> Thanks Cryowolf 
[16:15:11] <Cryowolf> I liked that aspect of it, the different approach

[16:17:16] <name100> hi
[16:17:53] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: if you wanna seem snobby and pretentious
[16:17:59] <theholyduck> you could call that a "desu ex machina"
[16:18:08] <theholyduck> for max cred
[16:18:22] <iloveyou> sou desu
[16:18:22] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, also avoid Redo Healer unless you're into borderline hentai revenge "porn"
[16:18:56] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: thats the rape one right. like who in their right mind.. 
[16:19:12] <theholyduck> like they looked SAO and is like "all the villains in SAO are rapists so clearly we should just make a rape anime
[16:19:23] <Cryowolf> theholyduck, unless they make it out to be a spirit that was in his body the whole time and was hoping to hide but had to come out to avoid dying. That would remove the Deus Ex Machina
[16:19:33] <Cryowolf> SAO are horrible at making villains
[16:19:53] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: i mean even if its "Inside him" the whole point is that something comes from out of nowhere
[16:19:57] <Cryowolf> every single time it's "ok so...they do rapey things here...and here...So obviously, they're bad guys"
[16:19:57] <theholyduck> and resolves the incident
[16:20:20] <theholyduck> i think suddenly discovering a super power mid fight to win the fight 
[16:20:22] <amigojapan> Ok Cryowolf 
[16:20:24] <theholyduck> using a entirely new skill
[16:20:25] <Cryowolf> theholyduck, not if it being there has a past reason, like why it was put there, by whom or what and when.
[16:20:26] <theholyduck> is deus ex machina
[16:20:39] <theholyduck> Cryowolf:  retconning in a past reason doesnt change that
[16:20:46] <Cryowolf> if there's a reason for it being there, it's not deus ex machina
[16:21:23] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: you can have a reason for it being there and it still being deus ex machina
[16:21:43] <theholyduck> like how all the aliens die of bacteria at the end of war of the worlds
[16:21:45] <theholyduck> is deus ex machina
[16:21:59] <name100> hi theholyduck 
[16:22:02] <theholyduck> the bacteria was always "there" and there is a reason for them being there
[16:22:04] <Cryowolf> I dont think that fits
[16:22:08] <theholyduck> but it was never plot relevant
[16:22:14] <Cryowolf> it was
[16:22:16] <theholyduck> until suddenly it just comes out of nowhere
[16:22:19] <theholyduck> and solves the ENTIRE problem
[16:22:22] <Cryowolf> they were devouring humans, even sick humans
[16:22:33] <name100> theholyduck: snuse du
[16:22:48] <theholyduck> Cryowolf:  :P i pulled that example straight from wikipedia.
[16:22:50] <Cryowolf> the ships were connected to them so they were getting the blood, bacteria and viruses into them
[16:23:01] <theholyduck> Cryowolf:  as a inauriable example of a deus ex machina that fits my definition
[16:23:11] <name100> theholyduck: ur norwegian, right? just curious. awaiting reply. thanks in advance
[16:23:14] <Cryowolf> fair enough that it fits yours ;)
[16:24:16] <theholyduck> name100:  i dont snus and  who cares :P 
[16:25:13] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: being able to justify it (however weakly) doesnt undo a deus ex machina if it just conveniently comes in and solves the entire problem despite having virtually 0 foreshadowing that it was an option this entire time
[16:25:24] <theholyduck> thats how i see it atleast :P 
[16:26:49] <Cryowolf> theholyduck, you could argue in the case of a spirit coming out to save someone, that the affinity to certain elements or a element that the person had being "higher than a grandmasters" or maybe said to be "as high as a great spirit"
[16:27:00] <Cryowolf> that would be hinting and foreshadowing
[16:27:03] <Cryowolf> maybe more subtle
[16:27:24] <Cryowolf> it then appearing wouldnt be out of nowhere if it's part of the plot
[16:28:49] <Cryowolf> but either way you want to call it. Deus Ex Machina in no way means "bad"
[16:29:04] <Cryowolf> maybe if it resolves the entire story and THE END then it does
[16:29:39] <Cryowolf> but if it happens in the fiirst third of the story and then is part of the story for the rest of it, that's different isn't it?

[17:26:14] <Cryowolf> travel costs in special uh taxis, I don't know the English word for it. They would also be to pay for overnight stays at the hospital. They would be used to pay for ergonomy related things like compression socks and so on for side-effects caused by the medicine and radiation. They would be used to pay for nutrition drinks (because I can't eat as much, I need to get important nutrition somehow). They would be used to pay for the 
[17:26:14] <Cryowolf> occasional medicine that's not covered by healthcare protection  (happens rather rarely tho.) They would be used for any emergency use, like if I need to go into the ER or anything
[17:27:07] <Cryowolf> They would also be used to pay for wound related stuff, cleaning wounds, compression, sterile pads etc that's not given to me on prescription

[17:27:21] <AmalLight> Cryowolf where are you ? if i can ask and you want response

[17:28:03] <AmalLight> oky
[17:28:19] <Cryowolf> all the things I mentioned are things that aren't covered by the high cost protection. Some of them have lowered costs, but they're still costs that me on disability can't afford at this rate

[20:42:02] <Sadale> Need to reprint the screen mount. I've made a mistaken on the design
[20:42:18] <isekaijin> Is there a Japanese course for weebs? So, basically, a course where you learn just enough Japanese to read manga, especially hentai manga.
[20:42:34] <omero> lol
[20:42:50] <Sadale> lol
[20:42:50] <isekaijin> None of those stupid historical or cultural shits, unless they are somehow relevant to hentai manga.
[20:43:27] <omero> this would award a double lol
[20:43:42] <omero> or ROTFL
[20:44:08] <isekaijin> Sadale: Do you have a 3D printer?
[20:46:01] <omero> arent you enjoying the pictures of those manga already, isekaijin ?! what is to be translated to you that you are missing...
[20:50:18] <[R]> Honestly, sometimes the plot adds to the fantasy
[20:50:32] <[R]> And you don't get that unless you can understand WTF is going on
[20:50:41] <isekaijin> omero: I can actually read them at the glacial pace of about two or three short sentences a minute, because I understand some basic Chinese characters, and hiragana is not hard to read at all.
[20:56:17] <Sadale> isekaijin, yep
[20:56:44] <isekaijin> Sadale: Nice. How much does the cheapest 3D printer cost?
[20:56:53] <Sadale> isekaijin, like $300
[20:58:00] <isekaijin> Oh, so probably $400 or $500 after bringing it here. What material do you use to 3D-print stuff?

[23:58:47] <Bco1981> Nanobot: she's not too bad a singing. Amelia was worse in the begining. but she is improving.
[23:59:08] <Nanobot> She's singing a song that doesn't require singing skill.
[23:59:21] <Nanobot> I'd say her singing is about on the same level as Ame
