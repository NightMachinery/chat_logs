[05:57:51] <tbrowder> oh, yeah, the original iot, but without the internet part.
[05:58:12] <perryprog> or you can use it to flex on the projecteuler forums
[05:58:29] <perryprog> and https://codegolf.stackexchange.com
[06:00:46] <tbrowder> did you know the us f-111f had its digital nav system programmed with punched tape readers plugged into the jet by ground crew members?
[06:01:18] <perryprog> Yes! tbrowder told me that just today
[06:01:28] <perryprog> That's pretty crazy
[06:03:55] <tbrowder> yep, but it was state-of-the-art at the time for operational gear
[06:04:56] <perryprog> Not quite as gnarly as string encoding your ROM, though
[06:05:07] <perryprog> and no, not "that" kind of string ;-)
[06:05:42] <perryprog> see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P12r8DKHsak&t=20s

[06:06:23] <perryprog> (this is a time-worthy rabbit hole by the way)
[06:06:26] <tbrowder> i should have said punched tape players i guess, read the tape and converted the tape holes to electrical signals
[06:07:14] <perryprog> Is there a semantical difference between reader and player?
[06:09:47] <tbrowder> i guess it depends on which side of the process you‚Äôre on
[06:29:15] <tbrowder> the apollo program preceded f-111 a bit i think, but it was a much different priority and had mucho dollars in its budget
[06:41:21] <tonyo> the earlier fa18s had a horizontal situational indicator that you'd have to calibrate on the flightline and would move according to what air speed indicated and projected a map onto a screen for the pilot to see where they were
[06:45:26] <tonyo> sometimes we'd get them back for cal and the map would be off the reel or it'd be off by several hundred miles
