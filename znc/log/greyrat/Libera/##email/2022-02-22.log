[02:07:53] <Khepra> welp, I must admit, ever since I switched away from "mynetworks" to dedicated SASL accounts, the paradigm shift nudged me to actually have real virtual_mailbox entries, which makes many things much easier in SASL and default "sender" for each app needing it.

[22:52:24] <hpfr> if you ran `git send-email` on a patch with a soft line that was over 1000 characters in length, would you not be able to email it inline? would lists reject it?
[22:57:10] <Khepra> dunno 'bout lists, but postfix for example would wrap
[22:58:02] <Khepra> unless git already properly encodes it and wraps nondestructively
[23:06:44] <hpfr> Khepra: ah yeah it seems to wrap with `=` thanks to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoted-printable#Quoted-printable_encoding
