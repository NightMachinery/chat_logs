[16:10:31] <opal> yeah so can masturbating in front of surveillance cameras
[16:12:03] <opal> < tpefreedo>…talk about taking no prisoners
[16:12:25] <opal> after a while you get tired of hearing the same half-assed suggestions from people who sensationally get involved in online privacy
[16:12:50] <opal> oh use delta oh use briar oh use tox
[16:13:04] <opal> well i dont know how briar is, i meant to use session as an example
[16:13:14] <opal> because session is that blockchain crap
[16:14:08] <opal> then you have the tinfoils swearing by otr and even pgp (the software, not the openpgp protocol) who have no clue that theyre advocating for broken shit and there are much better alternatives available
[16:14:56] <opal> and businesses such as signal, organisations such as PTIO, getting in on the trend and being equally incompetent for their own reasons
[16:15:32] <opal> i was a signal user even, out of convenience, til i moved completely to telegram and xmpp, and i couldnt justify defending moxie anymore
[16:16:13] <opal> silence has issues and depends on an antiquated communications network
[16:16:17] <opal> sms isnt even reliable
[16:16:57] <opal> i sent like zero texts and received very few legitimate texts ever since i bought my own prepaid service after moving out
[16:17:05] <opal> mostly mms/sms spam
[16:17:09] <opal> sms is shit
[16:17:29] <opal> i used to use it all the time back when dumbphones were still the thing and it was less accessible to pay for a data plan
[16:17:44] <opal> but now everyones using internet/voip shit thats provably more secure, stable, and sustainable
[16:18:46] <opal> telegram's "fine" but it isn't fsf-fine
[16:18:55] <opal> so thats why i shit on things instead of suggesting anything
[16:19:00] <opal> it isnt because i dont believe anything is good
[16:19:07] <opal> or feasible, more accurately
[16:19:23] <opal> im an avid xmpp proponent but it isnt there yet especially for family use
[16:20:06] <opal> forget making matrix accessible, xmpp is actually further ahead than matrix despite having much less of a driving force behind driving standards and implementations

[16:32:53] <kompowiec_> irc is doing well
[16:32:53] <kompowiec_> he was here 30 years ago and it will be long after discordics or other telegrams go out of style
[16:32:57] <opal> couldnt care less about the number requirement if im using it with people who have my number anyway
[16:33:01] <kompowiec_> out of fashion*
[16:33:09] <opal> "well"
[16:33:23] <kompowiec_> pirc.pl for example support chat history
[16:33:28] <opal> the spec was always badly designed and ircv3 is an attempt to badly fix that
[16:33:35] <opal> im not talking about amenities
[16:33:49] <opal> irc was never extensible and was always very poorly standardised
[16:33:59] <kompowiec_> but was first
[16:34:00] <kompowiec_> like email
[16:34:02] <opal> who cares
[16:34:10] <opal> email's actually properly federated, so is nntp
[16:34:12] <opal> so is xmpp
[16:34:14] <kompowiec_> and that's only and only why he won.
[16:34:22] <opal> all superior for their respective communication platforms, for now
[16:34:33] <opal> irc had early adoption, i wont argue that
[16:34:57] <kompowiec_> SIP also was first, even before skype. And also won
[16:35:04] <opal> its phasing out and even with something so small as freenode going down the shitter, you hear people upset about having to connect to multiple networks now
[16:35:31] <kompowiec_> multiple networks in IRC it itsn't big deal, unlike SPOF IMs
[16:35:34] <opal> and frankly the idea of multiple irc networks both is foolish and was never even initially anticipated
[16:35:42] <opal> it just happened because it was doomed toward segmentation
[16:35:44] <opal> because irc's shit
[16:35:54] <opal> xmpp doesnt have a spof lol
[16:36:15] <kompowiec_> i just have IRC, XMPP, Matrix, skype and that's it
[16:36:19] <opal> i hope you realise im arguing predominantly because i advocate for xmpp adoption and extension
[16:36:30] <opal> it isnt because its hip to hate irc or anything
[16:36:44] <opal> i have plenty of experience developing for, using, and breaking irc
[16:36:46] <kompowiec_> XMPP is really fine but you know...
[16:36:55] <opal> MUCs are garbage sadly
[16:37:18] <opal> idk if xmpp should take after matrix's solution partially or fully, or at all
[16:37:34] <kompowiec_> MUC uses more resources than IRC. Moreover, only unicast. This is not a substitute for IRC.
[16:37:43] <opal> everything else works (almost) fine
[16:37:52] <opal> who said mucs were a substitute for irc
[16:38:04] <kompowiec_> matrix just works like usenet
[16:38:16] <opal> usenet doesnt have a DAG lol
[16:38:58] <opal> nntp has more-primitive (but works for usenet) ways of handling resyncing with disconnected nodes
[16:39:05] <opal> and routing messages in the first place
[16:39:37] <opal> for one you actually have to peer instead of matrix just naturally federating
[16:41:01] <opal> also ownership of newsgroups does not exist anywhere near the same scope as ownership of matrix rooms
[16:41:52] <opal> two newsservers with separate policies are going to have their own views of the same usenet platform
[16:42:56] <kompowiec_> only what is left is to use the 3 mentioned above protocols and one SPOF IM. I think skype is the de facto standard in a world without standards.
[16:43:07] <kompowiec_> like microsoft office
[16:43:21] <opal> voip with xmpp as the signalling protocol actually works well
[16:43:34] <opal> i havent touched msoffice (or any office suite) in years now
[16:43:39] <kompowiec_> i hear that works great for dino and conversations
[16:43:53] <opal> i use latex for my resumes and whatever other professional shit i need to write
[16:43:58] <kompowiec_> but not for my gajim :(
[16:44:00] <opal> support for dino is out now?
[16:44:06] <opal> i think gajim is working on it
[16:44:17] <kompowiec_> i tried and it doesn't work
[16:44:30] <opal> gajim uses an older signalling protocol
[16:44:34] <kompowiec_> sometimes it does not even work on the gajim<->gajim
[16:44:39] <kompowiec_> idk why
[16:44:42] <opal> but i thought i heard they were going to follow conversations' footsteps sometime
[16:44:51] <opal> gajim's voip code is very crusty
[16:45:16] <kompowiec_> AstraChat it's only XMPP IM  which i can recommended for normies
[16:45:39] <opal> i recommend conversations but i keep forgetting the play store charges for it
[16:45:39] <kompowiec_> but it's closed source...
[16:45:55] <opal> better adoption for aftermarket cfw on android phones would be nice
[16:46:00] <opal> like reselling phones with LOS on it or whatever
[16:46:17] <opal> LOS has its flaws but the plus side is it supports many phones
[16:46:23] <opal> there are microg builds for it, all that fun stuff
[16:46:35] <kompowiec_> AstraChat works on desktop and mobile + jingle
[16:46:41] <opal> i switched from grapheneos once it stopped supporting my pixel 2 xl
[16:47:25] <opal> and microg's cool for the few things on my phone that want it
[16:48:49] <kompowiec_> phone != open source
[16:49:03] <kompowiec_> at least as long as you use the SIM card
[16:49:16] <opal> now we go back to the issue with sms :^)
[16:49:53] <opal> sim card, baseband, exotic device drivers
[16:50:10] <kompowiec_> you know, I think interoperability is more important than whether the program that offers it will be open.

[16:52:48] *** specing_ is now known as specing
[16:53:08] <opal> oh i work overnight, customers werent the issue
[16:53:24] <opal> overnight stocking is understaffed here so the people who actually show up have to shovel out more work
[16:53:42] <opal> i just feel like its a waste of my time, working for a company i dont believe in
[16:53:43] <kompowiec_> i gotcha
[16:53:57] <opal> would rather do shit that aligns closer to my beliefs
[16:54:12] <opal> eventually starting a nonprofit is my goal but that will be a while
[16:54:15] <kompowiec_> as long as they pay you to do it, I don't think it's a waste of time.
[16:55:05] <opal> i'd rather kill two birds with one stone and make a living wage to do something i believe in
[16:55:48] <opal> if i didnt have to worry about money then i'd just volunteer and work on my own projects all the time
[16:56:10] <kompowiec_> not everyone has to be able to work where they like. Good news for low-skilled jobs is that you don't bring work home with you, which is stressful.
[16:57:03] <opal> i just have a mentality that is completely at odds with that line of thinking
[16:57:09] <opal> i understand it but i just cant apply it to myself
[16:57:46] <opal> i'd put in extra work to something i enjoyed
[16:57:49] <kompowiec_> well, the atmosphere at work may vary. I would run as far from mobbing as possible.

[17:04:24] <vivien> I don’t know any criterion for which telegram could be "fine". It isn’t encrypted, it has a central server with all the messages and metadata, and it requires a mobile phone to use it.
[17:05:20] <opal> >isn't encrypted
[17:05:21] <opal> eh?
[17:10:03] *** Joins: madmiraal (~Thunderbi@78.30.18.184)
[17:10:13] <kompowiec_> opal: since there are no server source codes, encryption is no different than whatsapp.
[17:10:39] <opal> e2ee doesnt require trusting a server, thats exactly why e2ee exists in the first place
[17:11:08] <kompowiec_> like a client that cannot be changed.
[17:11:46] <vivien> According to https://telegram.org/faq#q-so-how-do-you-encrypt-data, you need to be in a secret chat to have end-to-end encryption.
[17:12:34] <kompowiec_> if I have stubborn people on SPOF IM, I tell them I am banned.
[17:14:05] <vivien> Are you banned from libera.chat yet?
[17:15:25] <kompowiec_> i mean syph like discord
[17:16:21] <kompowiec_> I will not be persuaded to telegram too, because the requirement of a telephone number is also an insurmountable barrier for me.
[17:16:58] <kompowiec_> one person offered to set up an account for me, but this raises even greater concerns about taking over the account ...

[22:16:36] <Noisytoot> shan, changing the formatting doesn't affect the meaning of the license (unless it's a very weird license)

[22:18:18] <Noisytoot> then it is still compatible

[23:50:37] <Guest5395> Hi ggoes and everybody else.
[23:50:51] <monkwitdafunk> Hello Guest5395 
[23:51:29] <monkwitdafunk> I like the idea of my use of libre free la liberte
[23:51:38] <Guest5395> monkwitdafunk Thank you for the cool article
[23:51:48] <monkwitdafunk> But that is a complex subject
[23:52:47] <monkwitdafunk> 11:51 <monkwitdafunk> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/install-fest-devil <<<--- this is a cool article (long time ago
[23:52:57] <ggoes> yeah, i like that one
[23:53:19] <Guest5395> But it was updated  2021/07/22 13:56:17 . Was it updated by RMS?
[23:53:41] <ggoes> possibly, most articles are updated in small ways from time to time
[23:54:22] <monkwitdafunk> Install fesf by mail and phone?
[23:54:30] <monkwitdafunk> Fest*
[23:54:49] <Guest5395> I would need some help to be sure I understood the before last paragraph.
[23:55:40] <Guest5395> Install fesf by mail and phone? Not a bad idea.
[23:55:56] <Guest5395> fest
[23:56:03] <Guest5395> *
[23:56:38] <monkwitdafunk> The last paragraph is the boot firmware, and hardware manufacturers
[23:58:21] <Guest5395> What I don't think I understand of the last paragraph is this sentence:
[23:58:25] <Guest5395>  The people who run the install fest should ask some users what the devil did to their computers
[23:58:53] <ggoes> presumably just so the user can articulate what it was and why it's bad
[23:58:58] <ggoes> but i haven't read that one in a bit
[23:59:53] <monkwitdafunk> No. But to design hardware as an OEM, they have to work with an open architecture design where a a distro and oem move under the same ideA.
