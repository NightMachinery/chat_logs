[00:54:24] <GeDaMo> As I said earlier, maybe it could be an offset into a table
[00:54:42] <nomagno> OH, I KNOW! A model where a special address holds the current region in memory in 256 byte chunks
[00:54:49] <GeDaMo> Yes
[00:55:05] <nomagno> So address 0xFFF9 could hold the higher 8 bits of the address
[00:55:13] <GeDaMo> The 6502 had a special 'zero page' addressing more

[00:55:36] <nomagno> Wait no, then I can't access 0xFFF9 :P
[00:55:58] <nomagno> I need to move the registers to my own 'zero page' in the first 256 bytes
[00:56:12] <GeDaMo> "A further addition to the register set is the 16-bit direct page register (D), which sets the base address for what was formerly called the zero page, but now referred to as direct page. Direct page addressing uses an 8-bit address, which results in faster access than when a 16- or 24-bit address is used." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDC_65816/65802

[01:00:36] <pyzozord> what's special about that lowest memory?

[01:56:55] <vdamewood> Yeah, JavaScript's idea of a type is more like 'is an object' and 'is not an object', so objects don't really have specific types per se, just prototypes.

[10:56:59] <smallville7123> yes

[11:03:26] <Amadiro> epony, that'll be a problem for programming on linux just as much tho. Also remember that patents don't mean that much -- companies always make a lot of them, as a form of deterrence. A patent is merely a claim on an invention, it doesn't actually mean anything unless it's exercised or challenged in court. In addition, someone programming on windows using microsofts UI framework would automatically get a license to use this patent anyway.
[11:03:42] <smallville7123> how?

[11:16:05] <Jong> what do you do when you just don't feel like coding but you know you need to get it done
[11:16:07] <Amadiro> epony, of course, because it's popular. And it has been for a long time. 
[11:16:12] <rsonx2> flakland: yes in C nad C++
[11:16:41] <rsonx2> so promotion is just type promoting to higher type
[11:16:46] <epony> because it has DEFECTS, popularity is just.. not because it is highly sought after
[11:16:55] <rsonx2> and demotion is type demoting to lower type
[11:17:11] <rsonx2> and what is pointer decay?
[11:17:34] <epony> but because it is installed by the vendor of the device and included in the hardware+software bundle, non-optional and got sued for that
[11:17:45] *** Joins: Doffi (~doffi@91.132.197.188)
[11:17:48] <Amadiro> epony, but linux has defects too. Also, amount of malware does not directly correlate with amount of defects -- you can have many pieces of malware target the same single defect. Additionally, a huge amount of malware does not target any defect in the operating system at all, instead in third party applications or simply the users naivete
[11:18:11] <rsonx2> demotion causes loss of information and it seem like pointer decays also cause loss of information.
[11:18:13] <epony> that's not an excuse, now you're saying that MSFT puts the defects on purpose because AAPL has defects too
[11:18:20] <epony> false logic ^
[11:18:39] <Amadiro> epony, I did not say that at all
[11:19:38] <rsonx2> I mean int [5] would decays to int * .Seems like compiler cannot work with bound checking after decay of the former type to the later.
[11:20:13] <Amadiro> rsonx2, yes, that's right. Types like int [5] are not terribly useful most of the time in practice
[11:20:33] <epony> people say "MSFT is bad" and you reply with Linux is bad too.. ;-) quite funny
[11:20:44] <rsonx2> but then compiler cannot perform bound checking.

[11:21:34] <Amadiro> rsonx2, thats right, and in fact performing bounds checking at compile-time in general in a way that's useful is basically impossible. That's why there's types like std::vec which do it at runtime.

[11:23:27] <rsonx2> ohh, I get it.
[11:23:57] <rsonx2> So sometime you don't want compiler to do stuffs that would make the program slow
[11:24:57] <Amadiro> rsonx2, ideally you would want bounds checking at compile-time, because if it happens at compile-time then it doesn't have to happen at runtime (making your program faster). But it's just generally not possible ot prove the bounds for arrays in the ways they're used in most computer programs (it boils down to the halting problem)
[11:25:33] <Jong> pencil vs pen for notetaking? Which do you use?
[11:25:38] <Amadiro> rsonx2, there's some languages like agda which only allow the usage of totally recursive functions (a class of functions which can be proven to terminate) and in those languages the compiler can do it (but these languages are not practically used)
[11:26:46] <Amadiro> rsonx2, that being said, C and C++ in particular really don't try very hard -- the C spec specifies that an array decays into a pointer when it's passed into a function, even in cases where it wouldn't _have_ to

[12:48:27] <dan01[m]> Like a car and a car engine
[12:48:48] <GeDaMo> A car engine is a component of a car
[12:49:01] <dan01[m]> In that case I guess it makes sense for the car to store a car engine field
[12:49:21] <apotheon> You could use dependency injection, I suppose.
[12:49:24] <dan01[m]> But doesn't the engine also have to know to what care it belongs?
[12:49:31] <apotheon> . . . which is not the same as fuel injection.
[12:49:47] <GeDaMo> The engine might have a 'car' field

[13:56:01] <amigojapan> piou: hmmm, what if you fail to pay your domain  fee?
[13:56:10] <merijn> Control over .nl is delegated to the Dutch government (who delegates it to a Dutch non-profit)

[19:58:44] <Stefan26> i understand turing machines better than lambda calculus
[19:59:04] <bjs> but untyped lambda calculus on its own is already as powerful as you can get, as far as we understand, since the system is equivalent to Turing machines
[19:59:10] <bjs> Stefan26: yeah lots of people do,  which I think makes sense

[20:52:09] <bjs> it doesn't really come up very much in actual day-to-day mathematics,  but the fundamental incompleteness (and incidental unsoundness) of our mathematical systems in the early 20th century was a big concern at the time
[20:52:17] <bjs> ejjfunky: it's known as Goedel's incompleteness theorem(s)

[20:53:28] <ejjfunky> bjs, i think i got it. it's like we claim that there's infinite number of prime numbers but we cannot know for sure because infinity by definition keeps on going.
[20:53:31] *** Joins: tradar (~tradar@user/tradar)
[20:53:44] <bjs> pyzozord: well the issue is that the logical system you need to describe "being meta" is just as powerful as a system with meta-y things in it
[20:54:44] <bjs> it's the same problem with turing machines + halting problem, if you try say "well okay we'll exclude programs that accept themselves" then you need to be able to compute equivalence of machines and that means you need a system powerful enough to have halting problem questions :P
[20:55:01] <bjs> which kind of implies it's not the "meta"y ness, but something slightly more fundamental
[20:55:01] <ejjfunky> bjs, so, say that we got the largest prime number ever. we won't know if there's another prime number until we compute it out. so, it keeps on going. likely true, but cannot be proven.

Goedel says that there are some statements for which a proof doesn't exist either way at all.  It's a curious little fact of mathematics but it's not generally impacting peoples lives

[21:05:10] <bjs> So it's a nice thing to learn about and try understand but unless you're trying to do something *really* fun it probably won't impact your life
[21:05:18] <bjs> ejjfunky: I think Russel was the one who really *broke* math
[21:05:38] <bjs> with his pesky paradoxes
[21:06:06] <ejjfunky> Russel, how? I think the incompleteness Theorem should have done it nicely already.
[21:06:31] <oldlaptop> He didn't break it, he just proved it was broken.
[21:06:38] <ejjfunky> bjs, you mean like the liar who swears he's telling the truth?
[21:06:40] <bjs> ejjfunky: Russel's paradox showed that the mathematical system people were using was *unsound*,  in that there were false statements which you can prove
[21:07:03] <bjs> contradictions,  which was far more serious and in the early 20th century mathematicians scurried about trying to fix it
[21:07:41] <bjs> ejjfunky: so you get two different ways in which math is "broken", soundness (can we trust a proof?) and completeness (is there always a proof?)
[21:08:00] <bjs> hopefully (!?) our modern mathematical system is 'fixed' and is sound,  but it's still always going to be incomplete

Consultants are more expensive. On average they seem a tiny bit more driven, but not to a degree to make up for their (doubled?) cost.

[22:57:39] <flakland> they're predictable
[22:58:25] <ProfSimm> Photons are like a linked list. They instantly link their source to their target as they don't experience time.
[22:58:26] <nomagno> GeDaMo: private companies aren't really characteristic of a free market
[22:58:27] <GeDaMo> I still can't get over the idea that photons are the basis of the whole EM spectrum, I thought they were only visible light :P

[23:01:31] <ProfSimm> But at least there will be a light show
[23:01:35] <nomagno> In a logical free market scenario these insecurities where everyone thinks if monopolies aren't enforced we'll run out of stuff, that is intervened logically towards improving the life of citizens and providing a strong incorruptible framework of ethical accountability and corporate downsizing, privatization is a very weak and fairly unnecessary ideology
[23:02:19] <Inline> it's about greed
[23:02:26] <ProfSimm> nomagno: ethical accountability has no meaning because there's no code of ethics that is precise and singular. This is why we have laws

[23:13:28] <beaky> and to implement arrays there are many ways the simplest is to have functions from index to value
[23:13:46] <pyzozord> ooh
[23:13:51] <GeDaMo> I think if you want C-style arrays, they would have to be primitives
[23:14:05] *** EtherNet_ is now known as EtherNet
[23:14:41] <GeDaMo> At the very least, you would need a way of allocating blocks of memory other than pairs
[23:14:43] <beaky> the efficient way is to use native arrays and the purely functional way is to use a purely functional map like intmap in coq or clojure's vector and map
[23:15:01] <ProfSimm> nomagno: if someone decides, it's not objective

[23:16:57] <nomagno> It's a real headache to avoid cartels
[23:17:26] <ProfSimm> oligopolies are not that. Oligopoly is monopoly, but instead of 1 company controlling a market, you have 3-4 companies doing so
[23:17:51] <ProfSimm> Oligopolies can form cartels, because they're few parties that can enter secret agreements
