[01:00:12] <msiism> HiccupJul_: What are you trying to do?
[01:00:19] <HiccupJul_> send a file from one pc to another
[01:00:24] <HiccupJul_> well, a folder
[01:00:26] <HiccupJul_> it has spaces in the path
[01:00:43] <msiism> And quoting doesn't solve that?
[01:00:51] <HiccupJul_> nah doesn't seem to
[01:00:55] <Elw3> So she mumbled "i dont know how to proceed" for like 3 minutes and then i just said straight "actually my phone number is 123456789" and she unironically asked for a prefix.
[01:01:05] <tomreyn> HiccupJul_: use sftp, not scp
[01:01:10] <esselfe> anyone knows if those "My passport" external drives work with Linux... does it require a windows only program?
[01:01:23] <Elw3> msiism like via notes in the mail?
[01:01:32] <hodapp> yeah, if you've ever tried to rsync/scp, spaces need escaped *inside* the quotes seemingly
[01:01:41] <msiism> Elw3: Cash by mail or in person.
[01:01:50] <HiccupJul_> yeah yeah i was just looking for a way to avoid that
[01:02:03] <HiccupJul_> *ignore the double "yeah"
[01:02:18] <HiccupJul_> i would use sftp but i'm looking for a command-based thing, not interactive
[01:02:47] <tomreyn> sftp can run a batch job
[01:02:51] <Elw3> Nono, cash by mail as in sending the money in an envelope or _cash by mail_ because the post service here also runs a payment system for orders, i dunno if thats custom in other countries.
[01:03:36] <msiism> I've never experienced that problem with scp. Interesting. But then, I don't put spaces in file names.
[01:03:41] <HiccupJul_> i guess i can make a wrapper script with something like this
[01:03:44] <HiccupJul_> https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/315052/100247
[01:03:49] <msiism> Or, maybe, use rsync?
[01:03:56] <hodapp> rsync has the same issue.
[01:04:07] <msiism> I see.
[01:04:11] <msiism> Why, though?
[01:04:26] <msiism> Elw3: Money in an envelope.

[03:44:11] <DrDon9_> rbox, a followup q regarding this server and some of the nmap results ive seen from it. This first hop server, i have recently discovered that by setting bridging router to the server with a 30 subnet (where the only two hosts are my router and the server), it starts dole-ing out random ips on diff subnets for every device that connects to the
[03:44:11] <DrDon9_> wifi, almost all of which have gateways ending in 254 with no open ports (so i lose the ability to find the ip to get back into the router).  What causes this?  Essentially im getting a whole bunch of static ips, which is cool, but i have no idea how or why thats the case.

[04:11:56] <DrDon9_> so if i manually close every port other than 443 or 8080 etc on my router, and it still scans as having netbios ports and random unusual tcp ports open, thats normal?

[10:36:33] <NeoNTFS32> <NeoNTFS32> I'm not sure the HDD will survive longer than the SSD but ! I can hear the old symphony that HDD is making when a file is loading.
[10:36:33] <NeoNTFS32> <NeoNTFS32> It's actually taking more time to format the free unallocated space to NTFS (so I would be able to put files on it and read it easily through Win') than a SSD. It's a 500GB partition. :)

[13:10:12] <bilbo555> hello. after i upgraded from using my on-board intel graphics card to my nvidia-card, i get a black screen after my PC has done a "suspend/resume", i.e. when i leave it for too long. when just the screensaver comes on, it works fine. since nvidia never resolves these types of problems, i am wondering if i can permanently disable this type of
[13:10:13] <bilbo555> suspect/resume behavior in my distro (debian)?
[13:11:22] <bilbo555> err, suspend, not suspect
[13:11:37] <bilbo555> is suspend/resume the same as hibernation?

[20:00:29] <gloomy> Hey. I have a script test.sh: `echo testing >> /tmp/test; xsel 2>&1 >> /tmp/test; echo done >> /tmp/test`. If I run it in the terminal, it works as expected (tmp/test contains `testing <selection> done`). But if I run it from an i3 keybinding, it hangs on xsel (/tmp/test only contains `testing <selection>`, no `done`). Any idea of why the behaviour might be different?

[21:25:09] <ThinkT510> you can pick up bad habits in any language. rust forces you to learn the implications of memory management without forcing you to manually manage memory (hence the learning curve). some safe languages abstract that away with certain cost/benefit impacts
