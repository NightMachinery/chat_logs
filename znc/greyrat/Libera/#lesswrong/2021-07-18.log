Here’s the pattern: “I’ve invented a fascinating new baking technique! With it, I have baked an amazing new cake!” “An amazing new cake?! Sounds delicious! Could we have a taste?” …)
[01:48:59] <quanticle> Yes, that's the one. Thanks for the re-link
[01:49:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> (That comment was, of course, the impetus for KLPMOR, as a case study in how to *not* do that)
[01:50:17] <quanticle> Lol saturn2's reply
[01:50:29] <quanticle> I'd forgotten it, but it's also excellent
[01:51:00] <quanticle> "As for impressive feats, or the “cake,” I’m pretty sure they aren’t really all that impressive. There’s low-hanging fruit that can be personally fulfilling but not particularly outwardly impressive, and the high-hanging fruit mostly amounts to an odd form of wireheading that leaves you outwardly functional but without a sense of self or of caring about anything." 
[01:51:32] <quanticle> "I've baked a cake, and by 'baked' I mean 'destroyed' and by 'a cake' I mean 'my sense of self'"
[01:51:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> ("I have a meta-technique that I can use to construct meta-techniques" "But what have you done with it" "I used it to make this technique to construct recipes" "But what have you done with it" "I used it to write this pie recipe" "But what have you done with it" "I used it to bake this pie" "But what have... wait..." "I ATE IT")

[02:23:39] <meowcat> it's just a very, very strange classification.
[02:24:42] <quanticle> Feels weird to call some of these people "philosophers"
[02:25:08] <meowcat> well yeah, "writers and thinkers" would be more accurate?
[02:25:15] <quanticle> And lol @ "Nietzche" being in a group by himself
[02:25:18] <meowcat> the only women are ayn rand and a bronte sister
[02:25:31] <quanticle> Well, that's just reflective of past prejudices
[02:25:42] <meowcat> the only black people are "WE DuBois" and MLK
[02:25:58] <meowcat> the only libertarians are ayn rand
[02:26:06] <meowcat> who hated being called a libertarian
[02:26:27] <quanticle> Also reflective of past prejudices. What you're going to go back in time and make philosophy, writing and other intellectual pursuits *not* a white, male, upper-class activity?
[02:27:08] <meowcat> daniel dennett is presumbaly subsumed into "New Atheism"
[02:27:29] <quanticle> I don't understand why the "founding fathers" of the United States are grouped, when their philosophies were actually quite divergent. Alexander Hamilton did not have the same philosophical outlook as Thomas Jefferson.
[02:27:48] <meowcat> also true. and tom paine was pretty dang influential at the time.
[02:28:41] <meowcat> given that it's an SSC/ACX survey, i would have expected mencius moldbug to be listed.
[02:29:23] <meowcat> or like any alt right sources at all

[02:29:38] <Betawolf> oh yeah, Locke but no Hobbes
[02:30:19] <gwern> and no Calvin
[02:30:29] <meowcat> i am entertained by the survey author not being able/willing to name any post-colonialist, intersectionalist, etc. writers.  like, you could start with edward said and howard zinn??
[02:30:35] <pompolic> they missed the most important one then
[02:30:46] <meowcat> Watterson?
[02:30:55] <saturn2> philosophy was also an asian upper-class activity :|

[02:32:34] <galambo_> can I run this shower throat through you guys? when I buy a computer, I say superfluous things like leds and fancy motherboards are a waste of money. you could get a better bang for your buck with say a faster cpu. similarly with food. why eat a pizza when you could eat 10 cans of soup for the same calories?
[02:32:43] <galambo_> why waste your calorie budget on a pizza?
[02:32:53] <meowcat> also, how do you put chesterton and lewis and tolkien and muggeridge, and not put ..... .... orwell? huxley?
[02:33:17] <rmmh> Most people like pizza more than soup 
[02:33:25] <Betawolf> galambo_: well, and hear me out here: eating food is not just about getting calories into your disgusting meat body
[02:33:30] <meowcat> i'm bifoodual, i like pizza and soup
[02:33:47] <pompolic> funny, i had almost the exact same thought today
[02:33:55] <galambo_> but soup is much more efficient than pizza for satiety
[02:34:08] <galambo_> and a whole pizza?
[02:34:10] <pompolic> "what if i just run a LP algorithm using calories"
[02:34:11] <Betawolf> but much less efficient for tastiness
[02:34:23] <rmmh> Is it, though? 
[02:34:23] <pompolic> for food selection
[02:34:34] <galambo_> soup is deliciosu
[02:34:39] <saturn2> why ever eat anything besides mealworm paste
[02:34:40] <galambo_> lots of soups
[02:34:42] <meowcat> i walked two miles for an artichoke pizza last night
[02:34:48] <Betawolf> I mean, there are good soups, but I presume galambo is not addressing such.
[02:34:51] <rmmh> Soup has bad calories:volume ratios
[02:34:51] <meowcat> is 
[02:34:54] <meowcat> it was awesome
[02:35:10] <meowcat> i've never walked two miles for soup, but i bet if i hadn't eaten in a day i would totally do that.

[02:35:31] <saturn2> what's the question associated with this list of thinkers? "which of these do you think are cool?"
[02:35:36] <galambo_> rmmh, you mean good calorie:volume ratio. our society eats too much
[02:35:40] <meowcat> pretty much yeah
[02:35:46] <pompolic> I don't think I'd get hungry pretty quickly if i only ate soup

[02:40:18] <galambo_> I think I actually figured out a way of asking how smart a person is: how many hours they spend cooking per week

[02:42:04] <gwern> quanticle: that's a big kitten
[02:42:12] <galambo_> kuudes, if they spend 3 hours a day cooking then theres probably not much going on in their lives
[02:42:32] <gwern> sounds like a pretty poor way compared to I dunno asking how many books they read
[02:42:55] <galambo_> but asking about cooking is more subtle
[02:43:12] <galambo_> and they might actually get excited about it and tell you about all their recipes
[02:43:20] <rmmh> Kenji is probably stupid
[02:43:26] <meowcat> some people cook while solving the world's problems. some people cook while watching soap operas. there is a wide range of shit people do while they are also cooking.
[02:43:31] <galambo_> instead of going like oh I like harry potter and feeling a bit embarrassed
[02:43:47] <galambo_> yes its not perfect
[02:44:15] <galambo_> also I dont cook and I am very smart so there must be a correlation
[02:44:42] <Betawolf> they might both be caused by hating yourself
[02:44:45] <kuudes> isn't food also other things than calories? vitamins, right aminoacids?

[02:48:02] <rmmh> 4800kJ?
[02:48:15] <kuudes> hmm, ok, so about half of normal requirement or little less
[02:48:16] <rmmh> 4.184kJ
[02:48:19] <adiabonkers> calorie or Calorie (i.e. kilocalorie)
[02:48:27] <kuudes> adiabonkers, yes
[02:48:42] <rmmh> No, 10% of normal requirements 
[02:49:06] <rmmh> Oh right EU food labels use kJ
[02:49:17] <kuudes> hmm. normal consumption is 10 for females and 11 for males
[02:49:32] <kuudes> iirc MJ, but I know I don't remember
[02:50:13] <kuudes> yes, MJ/day seems like the correct measure
[02:50:55] <pompolic> i usually see both indicated
[02:51:23] <kuudes> yeah, 100 W would be 100 W * 3600 s/h * 24 h/day ~9 MWs/day = 9 MJ/day
[02:51:44] <adiabatic> "soup isn't unhealthy" exceptions exist: lobster bisque is a _lot_ of cream
[02:52:55] <kuudes> can't be 10% because then the 100% would be about 4 times the recommended

[06:01:09] <feep> let me take this opportunity btw to remind ya'll that lvdb's chanson de geste ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5615090/24/Chanson-de-Geste ) is a fucking amazing narnia fic

[06:01:16] <feep> and it actually has a satisfying explanation for the susan thing
[06:01:22] <gwern> the problem with aslan is he'll just screw you over with the laws of the emperor-over-the-sea which *he* knows front and back, but you don't

[06:01:36] <Robomot> Chanson de Geste Chapter 1: Prologue: Edmund, a chronicles of narnia fanfic | FanFiction
[06:01:36] <Betawolf> I want to read the fanfiction where these kids come out of the wardrobe and are adults used to ruling a kingdom and fighting wars, but in the bodies of schoolchildren.
[06:01:54] <catern> <_<
[06:02:03] <rmmh> why would they go home
[06:02:26] <catern> IIRC that happens in Chanson de Geste? but maybe I'm thinking of a different Narnia fanfiction
[06:02:51] <shawwwn> That realization when 2022 is closer than 2021
[06:03:02] <feep> catern: it sooorta happens, but it's completely set inside narnia
[06:03:17] <feep> it's the sort of fic where that'd happen if it showed it, it just doesn't
[06:03:38] <catern> I definitely remember reading something like that in some Narnia fic
[06:04:19] <catern> speaking of fiction, Worth the Candle is over
[06:04:49] <gwern> and?
[06:04:55] <catern> so safe to read it if you've been holding off... 
[06:05:18] <catern> well I was going to talk about the ending but I figured that probably not everyone was reading it in real time
[06:05:27] <gwern> is it worth reading?
[06:06:02] <gwern> 'Feedback? :: Thank you for your article on the military tank photo AI experiment. Because you write about bitcoin and lesswrong, I can know with 100% certainty that the tank photo thing definitely did happen. Try not to electrocute your dick while taking research chemicals and hating women.'
[06:06:20] <catern> I'd say it's about equal to the other work of Alexander Wales
[06:06:42] <Betawolf> he really goes overboard with the meta stuff, to the point that most of the dialogue is characters talking about what the plot should be
[06:07:37] <catern> in some chapters, yes, definitely not the majority of the whole work
[06:09:18] <catern> but, anyway, I enjoyed it a lot (I was eagerly awaiting the ending) so I'd recommend it
[06:09:23] <catern> Betawolf: that's kind of a spoiler tbh
[06:10:10] <quanticle> Real talk, though, does Gwern write about LessWrong?

[07:47:02] * feep needs a transition stage :/
[07:47:22] * feep puts 700 lines in git stash...
[07:51:22] <feep> er, for context, since neat has macros, and objects can be passed across the macro border, any compiler change that changes the abi (or api) in a way that macros may depend on, needs a transition switch.
[07:51:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just finished reading https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49247320-the-seventh-perfection . Very interesting. Experimental format (it's entirely written in the second person) that ends up working surprisingly well (though, judging from the GoodReads reviews, not all readers managed to pay enough attention for it to work).
[07:51:27] <Robomot> The Seventh Perfection by Daniel Polansky (The Seventh Perfection book. Read 159 reviews from the world's largest community for readers. Daniel Polansky returns with The Seventh Perfection, an inn...)
[07:51:48] <feep> so when rebootstrapping, you can go "build new compiler with old compiler, generated code is post-transition, macro code is pre-transition"
[07:52:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Some clever implied worldbuilding (not very detailed, but then, it is not a long book)
[07:55:59] <saturn2> passing objects across the macro border seems like a bad idea
[07:56:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also (this is one of my periodic scourings of one of the local branch libraries for new SF/F releases) I just read a Star Trek (TOS!) novel which is all about how democracy is good
[07:56:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Did you know that people still write Trek novels?? Well, they do
[07:57:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> In this one, Kirk & Co. are Federation observers at a democratic election that some planet is holding, the first one after overthrowing a dictator
[07:57:52] <saturn2> common lisp has load-time-value to address that need without putting instantiated objects into the generated code
[07:58:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is possibly *the* most eyeroll-worthy Trek novel I've ever read (and I've read a lot of them)
[07:59:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Absolutely the most transparent "fantasy of Americans imagining themselves in the role of wisely guiding a grateful Third World nation into democracy" ever
[08:00:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Imagine every American-centric preconception, prejudice, and assumption about the world and other cultures
[08:00:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then imagine assiduously and strenuously taking pains to question none of them
[08:01:45] <feep> saturn2: yeahhhhh but writing macros in a C-like language is basically impossible without it
[08:02:03] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: bleh.
[08:04:17] <feep> saturn2: anyway it works as long as I don't also pass objects between compiletime and runtime
[08:04:32] <feep> basically "compiler before change" and "compiler after change" are just modelled as two different platforms.
[08:04:39] <feep> like using macros while building for arm.
[08:05:45] <saturn2> okay
[08:31:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> So I just started reading this book, sf, "one day we detect a signal from aliens", usual stuff
[08:31:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> BUT. First, it's almost 1000 pages long. Second, it's another experimental-format thing, written as a collection of documents. And third ...
[08:31:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... the author is a graphic designer.
[08:32:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's already amazing. Sample sentence:
[08:32:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The logo was a simple square, in black on a white ground. Underneath, in Microgramma Bold Extended, was the company name:

[08:33:01] <feep> ah, high art

[14:31:29] <feep> and then refs was at 37.
[14:31:35] <feep> well, refs was at 1
[14:31:44] <feep> but the classinfo pointer offset to the start of the vtable was at 37.

[16:31:21] <dbohdan> feep: Good job
[16:31:55] <feep> dbohdan: thank you, your praise justifies the expenditure of effort entirely <3
[16:32:10] <dbohdan> Awww
[16:34:23] <PapuaHardyNet> it is cute, there's no doubt about that
[16:34:53] <PapuaHardyNet> from the roundness of the lines, the bright color palette
[16:39:22] <dbohdan> feep: I don't know Neat's internals enough to say if it's a likely bug, however, I'd want to have some negative foo.instanceOf(bar) asserts to make sure instanceOf doesn't accidentally become { return true; }
[16:40:03] <shawwwn> Slept all night again..
[16:40:11] <feep> dbohdan: it'd crash first, instanceOf returns the instance
[16:40:24] <feep> I should assert that
[16:41:58] <dbohdan> I see
[16:42:54] <feep> dbohdan: I extended the test a bit to confirm that the returned instances are valid
[16:43:05] <feep> dbohdan: it's actually cool, what instanceOf does is
[16:43:17] <feep> it's a method that's implemented on every class, it's the first function in the vtable
[16:43:22] <dbohdan> \o/
[16:43:41] <feep> and it just does, "if I know I am class Foo, return cast(Foo) this. if I know I am interface Bla, return cast(Bla) this."
[16:43:54] <feep> literally just a sequence of ifs.
[16:44:18] <feep> er, "if you asked for Foo, return*"
[16:44:32] <feep> and it just goes through all its parents and all its interface parents and throws in an if-then for each of them.
[16:44:33] <dbohdan> I am not sure if that's elegant or hacky.  Probably both.
[16:44:35] <feep> :)
[16:44:42] <feep> hang on, the code for that is actually p simple
[16:45:03] <feep> dbohdan: https://github.com/Neat-Lang/neat/blob/master/src/neat/class_.nt#L499
[16:45:05] <Robomot> neat/class_.nt at master · Neat-Lang/neat · GitHub (The Neat Language compiler. Formerly Cx. Pre-Alpha. - Neat-Lang/neat)
[16:46:27] <feep> note the part where I just switch back and forth between "compiler code" and "code that will go in the compiled method".
[16:46:33] <feep> have I mentioned I fucking love quasiquoting <33
[16:47:09] <dbohdan> Does ~= append?
[16:47:16] <feep> yes
[16:47:30] <feep> targetClassinfo is the parameter to __instanceof
[16:48:07] <feep> that's just a marker that uniquely identifies a class, it's the vtable for classes and a random symbol token for interfaces (they don't have their own vtable)
[16:48:38] <shawwwn>  I had a dream last night where I had to define a superhero. Apparently the whole class did. And apparently the equation was f(x h) for some x greater than “superhero” status
[16:48:45] <feep> ie. if (foo.instanceOf(Bar)) == if (cast(Bar) foo.__instanceof(Bar.classinfo))
[16:48:53] <feep> shawwwn: XD
[16:49:16] <shawwwn> I think h was yourself, but I’m not sure
[16:50:21] <feep> dbohdan: it gets a bit fucky for interfaces because interfaces don't have instanceof methods of their own, since I just use the known one from the class, so it's more like...... if (cast(Bar) ((cast(void* function(void*, void*)**) cast(char*) foo - **cast(size_t**) foo) bla bla bla bla bla
[16:50:38] <feep> I wrote that once in the compiler, I'm not gonna write it again on irc lol
[16:50:46] <feep> let me just say it involves a lot of double pointers and leave it at that XD
[16:50:50] <dbohdan> shawwwn: Surely a "superhero" should just be strictly greater than "hero"
[16:51:20] <dbohdan> feep: I don't really understand the genInstanceofMethod code, but I get the gist
[16:51:26] <feep> :)
[16:51:40] <feep> dbohdan: it gets easier to understand if you straight up ignore recurse()
[16:51:44] <feep> that's only needed for interfaces
[16:52:34] <dbohdan> Why not give interfaces a dummy vtable?
[16:52:46] <feep> that's basically what I did
[16:52:51] <feep> only it's so dummy it's not even a vtable ^^
[16:52:56] <dbohdan> :-)
[16:53:14] <feep> literally just a random number I have lying around.
[16:53:20] <feep> something like cast(size_t) this, I think.
[16:53:30] <dbohdan> Heh
[16:53:47] <feep> er, the only reason it's a random number and not just {0} is so that the linker doesn't merge multiple markers with the same content.
[16:54:21] <feep> I don't know if it does, but why take the risk :) it's a hack anyway, eventually classinfo will probably live there
[16:54:37] <feep> ie. so you can do obj.classinfo.name in debug code, like in D
[16:55:18] <feep> wwwhhhich interfaces also won't have. idk.
[16:55:32] <feep> SOMETHING will be in there that isn't a random number. maybe just the mangled name of the interface.
[16:55:40] <feep> for funs :)
[16:57:02] <feep> dbohdan: oyeah, in case you missed it, idk if I poked you on it, neat has private now :)

[22:48:24] <dbohdan> 'The common name belladonna originates from its historic use by women, as bella donna is Italian for "beautiful lady". Drops prepared from the belladonna plant were used to dilate women's pupils, an effect considered to be attractive and seductive.[9][10][7] Belladonna drops act as a muscarinic antagonist, blocking receptors in the muscles of the eye that constrict pupil size.[48] Belladonna is currently rarely used cosmetically, as it carries the 
[22:48:24] <dbohdan> adverse effects of causing minor visual distortions, inability to focus on near objects, and increased heart rate. Prolonged usage was reputed to cause blindness.[49] '  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropa_belladonna#Cosmetics

It is native to Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia. …)
[22:48:27] <two2thehead> I will say this. Having a girl look at you with dilated pupils is quite cool
[22:48:30] <two2thehead> dbohdan, :D
[22:48:46] <two2thehead> I was wondering if anyone else knew about that
[22:49:45] <two2thehead> Dilated pupils are a guaranteed indicator of interest from a girl. It made me feel attractive whenever a girl looked at me like that
[22:50:07] <gwern> hm. that's a good comparison. it could just be an indicator of arousal/attention
[22:50:15] <two2thehead> yep
[22:50:20] <gwern> both are consistent with the favored/liked disfavored/disliked
[22:50:32] <gwern> you don't want an enemy which is smart *or* paying lots of attention to you
[22:50:36] * dbohdan takes notes for a future vtuber design
[22:51:26] <kuudes> is that the amnesia zombie drug?
[22:52:08] <two2thehead> kuudes, hmm? I don't believe so.
[22:52:17] <two2thehead> https://psyarxiv.com/65e9n/
[22:52:25] <kuudes> yeah, it contains scopolamine
[22:52:49] <two2thehead> dbohdan, make it so that whenever someone donates, the vtuber's pupils dilate
[22:53:05] <dbohdan> Beautiful
[22:53:14] <two2thehead> Kind of a mean thing to do, but I'm sure a double blind test will prove its efficacy
[22:53:25] <Gurkenglas> girl isnt paying enough attention to you? approach her and turn off the lights
[22:56:30] <gwern> sounds rapey
[22:57:47] <gwern> https://twitter.com/nickcammarata/status/1416824530811637764 hm. starting to get a bit concerned
[22:57:50] <|dbotdan> Nick Cammarata (@nickcammarata, 2021-07-18 18:17): ‘btw a lot of my smartest friends in random group chats are getting third Pfizer shots, also heard this rec secondhand from a Pfizer employee. I don’t know who this information could help but I thought I’d put it out there’
[22:58:05] <kuudes> I would get one if I could
[22:58:10] <two2thehead> same
[22:58:54] <two2thehead> serious question time. There are, at my last count, at least five separate vaccines out there. What would be the result if I take all five of them, evenly spaced out?
[22:59:28] <gwern> nothing bad afaik
[22:59:43] <two2thehead> hmm. okay that's my prior as well. gwern +1
[22:59:48] <kuudes> I just got my second shot 12 day ago
[22:59:51] <gwern> but I haven't been paying super much attention to multi-vax discussions
[23:00:10] <kuudes> each seems to have some weird risk around 1/100k or 1/50k
[23:00:26] <kuudes> but other than that, cross vaccines so far seem to have got positive info

[23:00:54] * gwern contemplates his travel plans. well, he's not going anywhere but the gym or a church dinner for the foreseeable future until relatives visit for christmas in late december, so running out to pick up more powerups doesn't seem terribly pressing
[23:00:55] <two2thehead> huh
[23:02:08] <kuudes> I have swum a lot
[23:02:29] <kuudes> then with kids I have went to different sorts of playground types of things
[23:02:43] <two2thehead> dbohdan2, this is exactly what I wanted. thank you
[23:04:08] <dbohdan2> You're welcome!

[23:09:16] <gwern> (I wonder what the real reason for joseph smith banning caffeine was? I can think of 3 plausible ones: (1) to save money, esp foreign exchange, as he'd not know about native caffeinated plants that could be cheaply substituted; (2) a small costly public signal of commitment, as a mechanism of cult solidarity, in addition to the tithe etc; (3) a personal dislike or poor tolerance of caffeine,...
[23:09:22] <gwern> ...typically reified as a grand universal truth)

[23:15:04] <Gurkenglas> suppose we could have gpt hijack an animal's nervous system for 5$ of hardware (plus cloud connection). how screwed are we?
[23:16:02] <two2thehead> define animal? Cat or dog? Very screwed. Just put some C4 on it and have it go towards a person or a place
[23:16:04] <Gurkenglas> spinal cord, i should say. you may want to add a webcam.
[23:16:36] <Gurkenglas> (you can interact with the brain - through the spinal cord interface.)
[23:17:23] <Gurkenglas> two2thehead, does that not also hold for a 20$ drone?
[23:17:49] <dbohdan2> gwern: When I thought about this (for, like, 5 minutes), I guessed (2) (a costly signal, mostly of ingroup solidarity) > (3).  I didn't consider (1), though, and the foreign exchange aspect makes it more plausible.
[23:18:13] <two2thehead> you don't have to build or program the muscles or sensors of an animal. Makes it a lot easier
[23:18:33] <gwern> tea/coffee are often looked upon with disfavor by rulers and political classes because you can't produce them indigenously, people are addicted to them, and they cost a lot in bulk
[23:18:43] <gwern> basically, a nicer opium
[23:19:33] <two2thehead> oh, before I forget. Also, cats and dogs are part of the 'natural' expected continuum for people. A drone is not

[23:20:30] <Gurkenglas> two2thehead, are we also screwed if someone opensources a gpt controller for 20$ drones?
[23:21:54] <two2thehead> probably. I hadn't even considered that option O_o
[23:22:33] <two2thehead> that's actually a VERY dangerous thing. Gurkenglas +1 for coming up with that idea

[23:23:41] <gwern> 1'A 1995 study of nose-picking, requesting information from 1,000 randomly selected adults from Wisconsin USA gathered 254 responses. It defined nose-picking as "the insertion of a finger (or other object) into the nose with the intention of removing dried nasal secretions". Of those who responded, 91% said they were current nose-pickers (but only 75% of these believed everyone did it), and...

Mucophagy is a source of mockery and entertainment in the media. …)
[23:24:31] <kuudes> gpt does not have a control loop
[23:24:51] <dbohdan2> gwern: I didn't think it was much of a concern in early 1800s America, but it seems coffee didn't become really cheap and abundant until later.  When exactly, a bit of search has not made clear to me.
