[06:37:24] <rocket_fuel> thx @The_8472 I only see BEP 42 that adds mutable items via DHT, what are the others? Which has the most traction?

[22:31:29] <TheSHAD0W> rocket_fuel: I think a lot of the DHT settings have been determined experimentally, not because of an analysis of how Kademlia works.  You might want to experiment, or not, and you might want to dive into the theory or math.
