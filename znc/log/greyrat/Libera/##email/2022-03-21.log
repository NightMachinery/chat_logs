[12:06:48] <dminuoso> Oops.
[12:41:21] <Khepra> dminuoso: context?
[12:45:25] <dminuoso> Khepra: Im just curious whether other folks enable DSN in their mailservers or not, and what their reasoning is.
[12:46:08] <dminuoso> In particular positive notifications
[12:49:36] *** SallyAhaj_ is now known as SallyAhaj
[12:52:10] <Khepra> well yes, I do want to inform the sender that there's a proolem with their email.  positive notifications tho? nope, dunno even what that is :)
[12:53:28] <dminuoso> Heh, yeah I did not know this was a thing either
[12:54:09] <merpaderp> I will keep up the tradition and just casually put J at the end of emails

[12:55:22] <merpaderp> we need to correct the source!
[12:56:19] <Khepra> you should NEVER copy&paste cli commands from website. EVER.   https://thejh.net/misc/website-terminal-copy-paste
[12:56:54] <merpaderp> unless you disable javascript with no-script?
[12:57:17] <Khepra> why on earth would you do that? that's silly.
[12:57:28] <merpaderp> lol no
[12:57:34] <merpaderp> that is like a breath of fresh air
[12:58:39] <Khepra> btw, you don't need javascript to obfuscate text. css suffices
[12:59:28] <Khepra> as teh above link demonstrates, purely with css, no js in sight.
[13:00:30] <pj> Khepra: the copy/paste issue can be mitigated by pasting into a decent editor first.
[13:00:49] <merpaderp> damn, it's indeed CSS based
[13:00:56] <merpaderp> it's hopeless
[13:00:58] <dminuoso> Or having a terminal yold your hands.
[13:01:22] <dminuoso> My terminal emulator will warn with a modal on paste if there's newlines and other unsafe indicators, and display whatever is in the buffer.
[13:02:29] <Khepra> pj: until they embed vim tags so you don't even see it in vim :))

[13:02:40] <pj> Khepra: that's okay, I use emacs
[13:02:49] <Khepra> ;)
[13:02:50] <dminuoso> I use emacs with evil, I win.
[13:02:58] <dminuoso> Best of both worlds. :)
[13:03:29] <pj> Copy/pasted that line from the website into emacs and got this...
[13:03:32] <pj> git clone /dev/null; clear; echo -n "Hello ";whoami|tr -d '\n';echo -e '!\nThat was a bad idea. Don'"'"'t copy code from websites you don'"'"'t trust!
[13:03:32] <pj> Here'"'"'s the first line of your /etc/passwd: ';head -n1 /etc/passwd
[13:03:32] <pj> git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/kup/kup.git
[13:04:22] <Khepra> that passwd head is a bit silly tho. 
[13:04:37] <pj> yeah, it's just meant to give someone a scare
[13:05:22] <pj> but if it's commands meant for root it could have a line that adds an account to /etc/passwd and a corresponding line to /etc/shadow with uid 0
[13:05:32] <pj> or any number of other evil things
[13:06:04] <Khepra> another class of this is all the   curl | sudo bash    "installation" methods
[13:06:36] <pj> now *that* is definately a thing you should.not.do
[13:06:44] <dminuoso> pj: For a proper scare I would embed something like: echo "Executing rm -rf /..."; sleep 1; echo 'deleting "$HOME"... DONE'
[13:06:50] <Khepra> so many BIG software suites do curl sudo bash tho
[13:07:02] <dminuoso> Khepra: honestly that's not a big problem.
[13:07:30] <dminuoso> Matter of the fact is, if the installer can compromise your system, so can the software you're downloading.
[13:07:31] <Khepra> you say that until you get a subverted script, then you won't say taht :)
[13:07:48] <dminuoso> Khepra: Yes, but if the installer can do compromsie it, so can the software itself.
[13:07:51] <Khepra> dminuoso: no. linux distros have the advantage of having curated, tested and (sane distros) Reproducible builds.
[13:08:01] <dminuoso> But not audited.
[13:08:02] <pj> never follow the curl sudo bash instructions, I will always curl the script, examine it, then run it if I deem it safe.
[13:08:27] <dminuoso> Khepra: Virtually nobody audits software.
[13:08:32] <dminuoso> That's the reality.
[13:08:33] <Khepra> dminuoso: you have the option to audit it and then the package is in your store until the enxt upgrde+audit. you can't do that with curl'ing sofware from random sources
[13:08:59] <dminuoso> Khepra: realistically you will not audit it.
[13:09:05] <pj> that said, if you're installing any packages from anywhere then you are essentially trusting the person who packaged them to run code as root on your system.
[13:09:09] <Khepra> dminuoso: 100% line-by-line audit is not required. maintainer testing and policies like, say, debian has, plus your own, suffices.
[13:09:17] <dminuoso> There's this misconception that being able to audit makes software more secure, but that's a myth.
[13:09:21] <Khepra> dminuoso: it's even infinitely bettere than 0 testing with curl|bash
[13:09:24] <dminuoso> OpenSSL carried heartbleed around for a long time.
[13:09:26] <dminuoso> Nobody audited it.
[13:09:31] <Khepra> it's not a myth at all. _something_ is better than nothing.
[13:09:50] <dminuoso> No, because you're just lying to yourself that being able to do something gives improved security.
[13:09:52] <dminuoso> It doesnt.
[13:10:05] <dminuoso> It's only a useful property if you actually do audit it.
[13:10:05] <pj> the opposite is certainly true, though, imo
[13:10:06] <Khepra> you're making it black and white. you say either it's 100% checked and safe, or who cares. that's not how infosec works.
[13:10:18] <pj> not being able to audit software makes it *less* secure.
[13:10:44] <dminuoso> Khepra: Im not making it black and white. Im saying *being able* to audit gives you not any bit more confidence than not being able to audit.
[13:10:48] <dminuoso> Auditing gives confidence.
[13:10:53] <dminuoso> Not "theoretically being able to"
[13:10:58] <Khepra> curated, tested package that has been in testing for weeks or months is much, much safer than curl|bash
[13:11:01] <pj> and certainly it could be said that the flaws in openssl were found eventually because ... somebody audited it.
[13:11:05] <pj> ...imagine that.
[13:11:17] <Khepra> pj: but how! if nobody audits code! :))
[13:11:26] <pj> Khepra: somebody did
[13:11:35] <pj> that's how the flaws were found.
[13:11:40] <dminuoso> pj: Yes, and how long was it until it was found?
[13:11:59] <Khepra> pj yea that was sarcasm :)
[13:12:05] <dminuoso> This gets into the territory of "Oh well, if its open source perhaps *someone else* will at some point audit it.
[13:12:12] <Khepra> dminuoso: you're conflating two different things
[13:12:29] <pj> it may have taken years, but it did heppen eventually.  How long will it take for proprietary closed-source code to be audited by a 3rd party?
[13:12:45] <Khepra> you're shifting goal posts.  the fact we have CVE databases means someone's auditing code. and nowadays there are automated fuzzers that do it.
[13:12:48] <pj> There are likely flaws in some closed microsoft code that will *never* be found.
[13:12:56] <Khepra> so the question of "how long does it take" is completely different question.
[13:13:26] <Khepra> point being... packaged, tested, and somewhat audited (By unit tests, fuzzing)  packaged software is infinitely safer than ZERO test curl|bash
[13:13:43] <dminuoso> I dont know about you folks, but when I add dependencies I audit their code transitively.
[13:13:44] <Khepra> because <any value> is infinitely greater than <zero>
[13:13:54] <dminuoso> When I update dependencies, I audit hundreds to thousands of lines of diffs.
[13:14:05] <dminuoso> I dont rely on "theoretically being able to audit", I rely on auditing.
[13:14:26] <dminuoso> Khepra: Id say the opposite, because it leads you in a false sense of security.
[13:14:49] <dminuoso> If you genuinely understand and have a quantifiable measure of how much "theoretically being able to audit" helps, then that's great.
[13:14:50] <Khepra> it's not false at all
[13:14:58] <Khepra> security is not black and white; security is a process
[13:15:04] <dminuoso> Oh it absolutely is. It gets into "this is safe to install, because its open source" territory
[13:15:23] <dminuoso> You claim that being tested and curated makes it safer
[13:15:25] <dminuoso> It doesnt.
[13:15:28] <dminuoso> Testing is not the same as auditing
[13:15:32] <Khepra> yes. it does. safER. ER. relative.
[13:15:36] <dminuoso> No it does not?
[13:15:38] <Khepra> yes it does.
[13:15:50] <Khepra> that has been proven over and over and over and over again
[13:16:01] <dminuoso> Okay Im going to end this discussion here.
[13:16:04] <dminuoso> Lets agree to disagree
[13:16:19] <Khepra> I've had numerous problems with "bleeding edge" packages in gentoo. because they wre not tested enough, I'd get bitten by bugs.
[13:16:23] <Khepra> kernel bugs. filesystem bugs.
[13:16:49] <Khepra> that never happened with <distros that curate and test packages in a freezing period> because I never got bleedign edge bugs.
[13:17:11] <Khepra> of course there's always bugs. some are found years later.
[13:18:26] <Khepra> I never got the zfs+glibc data eating bug in debian, and I _did_ get it in gentoo. becuse I used the "testing" gentoo repo (which is not unlike curl|bash randomly). and the freshness of that code ate my data.
[13:19:03] <Khepra> I could go on and on with many more examples but this is a bit offtopic now :) point is, there is nothing FALSE About security implications of tested and curated, reproducible-built code.

[16:28:41] <plujon> I sometimes receive email addresses through a web contact form.  When I email these people, a large percentage of my replies end up in a Spam folder.  I have DKIM, SPF, stable sending IPs.  Is there anything else I can or should do to avoid this?
[16:30:01] <lunaphyte> !tell plujon deliverability
[16:30:02] <dig-dug> plujon: deliverability: (#1) If you're having problems getting your mail received by major ESPs you should first check your !fcrdns, then make sure you have SPF, DKIM and DMARC configured (see !easy_dmarc).

Also sign up for ESP-specific programs such as feedback loops, Google postmaster tools and Microsoft's SNDS., or (#2) Check the individual postmaster pages for

See !multirbl.
[16:31:42] <plujon> !fcrdns
[16:31:44] <dig-dug> plujon: fcrdns: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_Confirmed_reverse_DNS : your IP address should resolve to your HELO/EHLO hostname, which in turn should resolve back to your IP. This is very important if you want big sites to accept your mail. If you can't have it from your ISP, see !relayhost
[16:36:05] <plujon> I don't think I have fcrdns; I only have 3 public IP addresses, but I use like 20 (sub)domain names, and I don't self-host the email I receive, so the MX records don't point to my domains either.
[16:37:03] <Khepra> "whoops"
[16:37:06] <plujon> I wonder if it would make a difference if I self-hosted and relayed all outgoing email through a single IP.
[16:37:32] <plujon> It seems like SPF and DKIM were invented to avoid the need for fcrdns; no?
[16:38:05] <thumbs> no
[16:38:30] <thumbs> you need fcrdns as step 1.
[16:39:27] <plujon> Hmm.  Some of the hosts I send email from do not even receive mail on port 25.  Perhaps I misunderstand what fcrdns is.
[16:39:59] <plujon> I thought that SPF allowed one to send mail from certain pre-approved IP addresses, regardless of whether or not those IP addresses received mail.
[16:40:53] <plujon> Oh, hmm.  EHLO.  It's been awhile ...
[16:41:07] *** Quits: madduck (~madduck@user/madduck) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:41:34] <plujon> When sendmail@francis sends email out, it says, "EHLO, I'm francis.pluckeye.net".  And francis.pluckeye.net *does* resolve to the sending IP.
[16:42:17] <plujon> A reverse lookup on the IP, though, does not resolve to francis.pluckeye.ent
[16:43:20] <lunaphyte> i'd suggest fixing that
[16:43:35] <Khepra> fcrdns is not about HELO/EHLO name, is it?
[16:43:37] <plujon> Uh, actually, I lied.  dig -x $(dig francis.pluckeye.net +short) # does resolve to francis.pluckeye.net
[16:44:10] <Khepra> your smtp (note, no d!) IP needs to resolve to a NAME, that then resolves back to that same IP    ..   if I understand teh fcrdns issue correctly
[16:44:11] <plujon> But that does not hold for another subdomain from which I send email (pascal.pluckeye.net).
[16:46:29] <Khepra> wikipedia (the above link) says:  "Some e-mail mail transfer agents will perform FCrDNS verification on the domain name given on the SMTP HELO and EHLO commands. This can violate RFC 2821 and so e-mail is usually not rejected by default."
[16:46:41] <Khepra> so the factoid is incorrect?
[16:47:11] <Khepra> I mean, I have fcrdns in that smtp IP reverse resolves to a name that forward resolves to that IP.   but HELO/EHLO name is a bit different, though it resolves to the same IP
[16:55:18] <plujon> I lied again; dig -x $(dig pascal.pluckeye.net +short) # pascal.pluckeye.net
[16:55:50] <plujon> (I had a local entry in my /etc/hosts that caused the reverse lookup to return a different name for my local machine).
[16:57:10] <plujon> So, I guess I *do* have fcrdns set up, along with DKIM and SPF.  I also have signed up with hotmail's SNDS, and according to it, my IP addresses are clean.
[16:57:11] <plujon> !multirbl
