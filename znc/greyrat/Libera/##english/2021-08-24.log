[00:01:46] <darsie> How fast did my paste come through?
[00:02:02] <blkshp> Fast enough that if ozone were in the channel, you wouldn't be.
[00:03:00] <StayHungry> darsie: it's ok, you'll manage :)
[00:03:18] <darsie> manage being or not being?

[00:08:16] <paulo> !ety alter
[00:08:18] <tinsoldier> alter — late 14c., "to change (something), make different in some way," from Old French "alterer" "to change, alter," from Medieval Latin "alterare" "to change," from Latin "alter" "the other (of the two)," from PIE root "*al-" (1) "beyond" + comparative suffix "-ter" (as in "other"). Intransitive sense "to become otherwise" first recorded 1580s. Related: "Altered"; "altering"....
[00:08:27] <paulo> !ety other
[00:08:29] <tinsoldier> other — Old English "oÃ¾er" "second, the second of two; additional, further" (adj.), also as a pronoun, "one of the two; a different person or thing from the one in view," from Proto-Germanic "*anthera-" (source also of Old Saxon "athar", Old Frisian "other", Old Norse "annarr", Middle Dutch and Dutch "ander", Old High German "andar", German "ander", Gothic "anÃ¾ar" "second, other"). ...

[00:15:24] <StayHungry> modern 'politically correct' bible translations drive me crazy
[00:16:45] <blkshp> In the name of the parent, the child and the holy non-biological plasmodic lifeform.
[00:18:20] <StayHungry> e.g. 'strangers' in the passage 'The Lord watches over the strangers, he upholds the orphan and the widow, but the way of the wicked he brings to ruin' is now 'resident aliens'
[00:18:46] <StayHungry> resident aliens? wtf is this?
[00:19:07] <blkshp> People from other places, potentially immigrants that have leave to remain. 
[00:21:47] <dTal> That's interesting. Does that mean that "stranger" used to mean "someone from far away" rather than "someone you don't know"?
[00:22:00] <dTal> I suppose, at one time, they would have been synonymous.
[00:22:22] <blkshp> I believe so
[00:22:49] <dTal> So, someone who is strange in general
[00:23:44] <StayHungry> dTal: there are translations where 'foreigners' is used instead of 'strangers', yes

[00:24:24] <dTal> StayHungry: right, what I'm getting at is what that implies about how English has changed.
[00:24:50] *** Joins: stoiclunchbox (~stoiclunc@user/stoiclunchbox)
[00:26:48] <StayHungry> and, strangely, 'fatherless' instead of 'orphan'
[00:27:49] <TimMc> "extranjero" (same root as "stranger") is Spanish for "foreigner", IIRC
[00:28:34] <TimMc> StayHungry: That just sounds like a *bad* translation more than anything else.
[00:28:58] <TimMc> or, possibly, overly literal rather than trying to capture the meaning

[00:33:01] <StayHungry> TimMc: yeah, my only hope is that I can find a balanced version that takes into account the refinements of the originals, but is not poisoned by the linguistic vagaries of recent years

[00:40:30] <TimMc> Do you want it to sound poetic or do you want it to be as accurate to the original language's intent as possible?

[00:47:55] <TimMc> Like, what if the most correct translation really is "resident alien", would you be at peace with that?
[00:52:13] <StayHungry> TimMc: it should move me. :) If poeticism helps, I'm all for it, as long as there's no substitution of ideas ,)
[00:56:41] <StayHungry> resident alien is hardly an accurate translation because the very concept sounds modern
