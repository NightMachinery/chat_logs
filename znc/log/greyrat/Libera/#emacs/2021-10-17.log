[10:02:55] <edrx> how is your presentation going?
[10:03:21] <codingquark> I rehearsed the first run today :D
[10:03:31] <edrx> wow! great!!!! =)
[10:04:14] <edrx> did you like the result?
[10:04:48] <codingquark> What I did was to setup a Debian 11 VM from scratch, and ran the whole demo. Then I ran the demo once again, this time knowing what I'm going to do, and took notes. Then I ran the demo again, this time from notes and checked if it covers all the things I want to cover
[10:05:51] <codingquark> Tomorrow I'll try to see if it is "simple enough" and still covers the topics. Then I need trim or stretch to fit sections to timing
[10:05:53] <edrx> ah, good idea
[10:06:30] <codingquark> :)
[10:06:33] <edrx> did you discover dependencies that you had not listed?
[10:07:20] <edrx> I haven't started rehearsing mine =/
[10:08:24] <codingquark> Well, from the very first draft, I had to change sequence of a few things to make them be more coherent
[10:09:38] <codingquark> I have discovered that I like revising my stuff up to a point. For blog posts etc, I recently started revising up to a self-decided deadline. I would write 3-4-5 drafts. It is a lot of fun

[19:30:41] <corwin> that's about right, afaik. In principle I think it's responsible to create the makefile

[19:34:11] <corwin> as you might glean from the compound command I'm using, my priority is not having to execute a bunch of steps in sequence (and thus remember those steps), rather than avoiding unneeded computation.
