[01:47:40] <LyndsySimon> I have a function that I'm autoloading from `~/.config/zsh/functions`. That works fine, but I'm finding that functions that I'm declaring inside that file are loaded into the shell context when I use them, even when I use the `local` keyword.
[01:48:03] <LyndsySimon> Is there a way to use functions inside an autoloaded function, without them being made available to the outer scope?
[01:48:36] <osse> No. A usual "trick" is to prefix their names with two underscores
[01:48:56] <osse> in your interactive shell if you type __<Tab> you'll probably see a bunch of functions you didn't know existed
[01:49:37] <Gamma> underscore functions are all processed by completion, so it's probably better to choose a different prefix
[01:50:04] <osse> that's why I added a second underscore :p
[01:50:19] <LyndsySimon> Huh. Well, that answers my question at least :)
[01:50:32] <Gamma> oh does compsys only proces _[^_]* ?
[01:51:20] <osse> I surely hope so! _git defines a bunch of helpers called __git_foo

[01:52:55] <LyndsySimon> My functions prefixed with a double underscore still autocomplete, once I've called the autoloaded function.
[01:53:31] <osse> LyndsySimon: but they aren't recognized as the completion function for a command
[01:53:40] <osse> (which I assume is what Gamma was talking about)
[01:54:00] <LyndsySimon> Here's what I'm doing, if you're curious. I basically re-implemented `z`:
[01:54:13] <Gamma> No matter what they share the same namespace. Even (){ local -A functions } doesn't work
[01:54:40] <LyndsySimon> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/VqHMOESg/d
[01:55:09] <LyndsySimon> Well, that upload is annoying. Hold on, I'll just push the repo.
[01:55:11] <Gamma> iirc You can  zstyle ':completion:*:functions' ignored-patterns '_*' or similar

[01:56:59] <LyndsySimon> It's not important, but I'm open to feedback on my style and usage. I don't often write stuff in Zsh.
[01:57:34] <Mikachu> also compsys won't do anything with functions starting with _
[01:57:45] <Mikachu> it will look in files starting with a _ in $fpath, but that's not exactly the same thing

[02:03:17] <Gamma> Named directories in zshexpn(1)
[02:03:38] <Mikachu> some assembly required

[02:04:50] <Mikachu> i need to rework mine a bit so it isn't hellish to look at
[02:04:59] <LyndsySimon> Gamma: Part of my goal here is to make it fairly usable out of the box and "batteries included"
[02:05:29] <LyndsySimon> I'm wanting to be able to share it with coworkers. Most of those are devs, but not all. Mucking with zsh init isn't really an option for them.
[02:05:30] <Gamma> Well, using static named directories is absolutely usable ootb
[02:05:42] <LyndsySimon> Yeah, i'm seeing that. I just need to grok it fully.
[02:05:53] <Gamma> hash -d name=$PWD; cd ~name
[02:07:27] <LyndsySimon> Hmm. I think that mostly suits my needs.
[02:07:54] <LyndsySimon> Just need to add an alias or something to `hash -d <name>=$PWD`.
[02:08:14] <LyndsySimon> I love that it can be used as an argument to arbitrary commands.
[02:08:22] <Mikachu> something you can do with dynamic directories is cd ~[15] and you end up in the directory of the terminal that uses /dev/pts/15 as the tty device (just as an example)
[02:08:42] <LyndsySimon> Hmm. They don't persist between session by default.
[02:08:53] <Gamma> Right, just like aliases
[02:09:48] <LyndsySimon> Damn. OK. I'll do some thinking on it. Adding a line or `brew install`ing something would be fine.
[02:10:17] <LyndsySimon> I might rework my `d` function into an extension or something that relies on static named directories.
[02:11:25] <Gamma>  I  prefer using them as they are ootb (if I want another one, I'll add it to my zsh config), but I can see the desire to have a frontend for it.
[02:11:47] <Gamma> But then you need to worry about simultaneous zsh sessions getting in each others' way
[02:12:03] <LyndsySimon> I'm fine with that for my own use. I'm pretty happy with the normal tab expansion, honestly. I'm trying to get others hooked on productivity hacks.
[02:12:45] <LyndsySimon> At any rate, thanks :)
[02:12:50] <Gamma> tbh dynamic directories might be *easier* to do something like this with
[02:12:54] <LyndsySimon> I learned something today.
[02:13:14] <Gamma> Since tab completion and expansion always goes through a function you write
[02:13:22] <LyndsySimon> I know my coworkers have various ways of structuring their stuff. I can't imagine an easy way to disambiguate that.

[02:28:25] <Gamma> syscomet: Ah, so you create a new zdnf for each prefix you configure
[02:29:01] <syscomet> Yup, thus the eval.  I normally strenuously avoid eval, but since this function is only called by me, in a machine-specific rc file, it's okay.

[02:29:26] <Gamma> https://gitlab.com/xPMo/dotfiles.cli/-/blob/dots/.config/zsh/functions/zdn_generic_alternate
[02:30:04] <syscomet> The key is that `zsh_directory_name` is paired with `zsh_directory_name_functions`, like many zsh internal hookable functions, so there's a global function, or an array of function names.
[02:30:44] <Gamma> And configured here: https://gitlab.com/xPMo/dotfiles.cli/-/blob/dots/.config/zsh/local/functions.zsh#L8

[02:56:19] <syscomet> Gamma: want_resolve forces a symlink resolution so that you end up with $PWD under the absolute path, instead of remembering you reached it via the symlink, making the symlinks very much a "short cut" rather than "work under here".  elide_prefix is currently unused by me ... I think it's when you have a dir where many the sub-dirs all start with the same string pattern.
[02:57:32] <syscomet> Yup, `pdp_dirname_subdirs nats-io n ~nats-io nats-` means I can do `cd ~[n:server]` and end up in `/home/pdp/syn/go/src/github.com/nats-io/nats-server`

[06:53:08] <k_sze> No, I was in an interactive zsh session
[06:53:32] <k_sze> I typed 'exit' and it exited with 127 this morning, and 137 the other day.
[06:54:16] <Gamma> It will exit with the exit code of the last run command, unless you do `exit 0`
[06:54:29] <k_sze> I see.
[06:55:38] <Gamma> So if the last thing you did before exiting was misspell a command, you'll probably see 127.

[17:14:48] <nesmysl> hurrah
[17:15:34] <nesmysl> does anyone here use setopt nopromptpercent?
[17:17:20] <nesmysl> having this option off breaks so many things in the shell i wonder what circumstances make it useful.
[17:20:10] <nesmysl> one instance would be the correct option: zsh: correct '%R' to '%r' [nyae]?

[18:46:16] <leah2> nesmysl: i guess with PS1='> ' you can disable it ;)
[18:49:30] <nesmysl> not really: as i said corrections don't work, xtrace is crippled: '+%N:%i> git diff --name-status', and that's just what i spotted in in a few minutes
[18:49:50] <leah2> well then send PS4 too
[18:49:52] <leah2> set*
[18:55:10] <nesmysl> it's curious because while print -P stopped working, ${(%)%{...%}} works normally
[18:58:16] <nesmysl> so the question is two-fold: does anyone actually endure this ;), and what is the setting purported to achieve

[19:38:06] <llua> the option is PROMPT_PERCENT, so disabling it would only be useful if you don't want its effects. which comes with all that you have noticed.

[21:26:15] <nesmysl> yes, PROMPT, not XTRACE or CORRECT or any other thing. also, circular reasoning.

[21:27:22] <et09> is there a command to copy them to barbaz-{x,y,z}.sh
[21:27:34] <et09> (i can do copy to another dir and then rename, but just wondering)
[21:28:02] <nesmysl> zcp, see zshcontrib(1)

[21:28:24] <nesmysl> et09: ^^
[21:30:27] <nesmysl> roughly: autoload -Uz zmv; zmv -CW foobar-\*.sh barbaz-\*.sh
[21:30:59] <nesmysl> don't trust this code, check the man page
[21:31:08] * et09 trusts this code
[21:32:10] * nesmysl check /whois.  ok, he's on the other side of the planet.
[21:34:01] <et09> who me?
[21:35:09] *** Quits: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech) (Quit: Bye.)
[21:38:03] <Mikachu> zmv -n will list what it does
[21:38:21] <Mikachu> also there's no info in the manpage but you can check zmv
[21:38:29] <Mikachu> ie, run it with no arguments; it doesn't recognize --help or -h :)
[21:38:50] <Mikachu> ah, that doesn't list -n either
[21:38:53] <Mikachu> zmv -<tab> does
[21:40:33] <Mikachu> oh there is a lot of info in the manpage, maybe i confused the help output with the manpage wrt info content
[21:41:17] <Mikachu> and seems like completion is missing some options too

[23:14:07] <velo> this mean i can't write to the file from shell no more?
[23:14:15] <velo> even with >>
[23:15:19] <ft> You can read some state, like "zstyle -L". But you can't resurrect an arbitrary zsh program, which that file is.
[23:15:26] <llua> restore from a backup
[23:15:49] <ft> Don't think that option exists, given the question. :k
[23:16:04] <llua> prime time to set up backups
[23:16:13] <ft> Definitely.
