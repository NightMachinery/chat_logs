[01:34:39] <austreelis> Hey, I updated my system and since then qutebrwoser doesn't make any sound (e.g. it doesn't even appears as a stream in pavucontrol). I ran `qutebrowser -T -d <some youtube video url>` and collected the following logs: https://pastebin.com/sbB0Unpq . I noticed lines 153-156 reports some alsa stuff failing, don't know if that's the actual issue.
[01:35:58] <The-Compiler> austreelis: no idea, that's all coming from the underlying Chromium
[01:37:39] <austreelis> thanks :) sorry then

[07:18:54] <toofar> if you are looking at dom stuff you can do Array.from(someElements).forEach(...)
[07:25:35] <birkoff> specifically I stumbled it in code that I wrote
[07:25:49] <birkoff> devtools console would show:  TypeError: document.querySelectorAll(".title-class").forEach is not a function. (In 'document.querySelectorAll(".title-class").forEach', 'document.querySelectorAll(".title-class").forEach' is undefined)
[07:29:14] <toofar> and that works in chrome? It though it didn't work anywhere
[07:29:35] <toofar> but yeah, Array.from() should wrap them in real arrays
[07:32:18] <birkoff> works in firefox

[15:08:41] <Nickli> when autosave happens, to what session will it save?
[15:13:59] <Nickli> i have mistakenly closed down my main window several times and it seems like the tabs i had open was not saved
[15:18:37] <The-Compiler> Nickli: whatever was last loaded, unless you set session.default_name
[15:34:07] <Nickli> The-Compiler, would i be possible to use date for naming the default session?
[15:36:00] <Nickli> like the date command in this question
[15:36:15] <The-Compiler> Nickli: can't think of a good way to do this right now. I suppose you could run something daily which checks whether qutebrowser is running, and changes the setting either via a qutebrowser command or via the config file.
[15:37:48] <Nickli> wouldn't need to be some daily per sÃ©, maybe the time you started a fresh qutebrowser instance, just a random thought i had
[15:38:24] <Nickli> but that could easily be shown if the latest change/save date was shown when listing sessions
[15:41:02] <Nickli> *the same effect could easily be achieved...
