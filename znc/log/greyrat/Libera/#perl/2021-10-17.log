[12:41:35] <ggherdov> Hello, I'm looking for a module that can extract the class hierarchy of my perl code (eg. to generate documentation). The hierarchy isn't very complicated, I could grep for "@ISA" and get away with it, but I wanted to try something more sophisticate. I found PPI, https://metacpan.org/pod/PPI , could that be what I need? Thanks for any suggestion

[12:50:16] <mst> ggherdov: are you ok with loading the modules to do it?
[12:50:39] <ggherdov> mst: yes, I think that's fine
[12:50:44] <mst> if yes, I'd probably use Class::Inspector
[12:50:58] <ggherdov> thanks mst, I'll check that
[12:51:04] <mst> or if it's OO code using Moo/Moose/Mojo and you're using roles, walking it with Class::MOP is probably nicer
[12:51:21] <mst> there's also Pod::Inherit which is designed to generate superclass references into your POD during dist build
[12:52:05] <mst> and finally, if you want to see how the sausage is made, Data::Printer will print out class hierachy info for objects as it dumps them and if you go through the source code I wrote the code that extracts the information a few years back and it's pretty solid
[12:52:48] <ggherdov> mst: thanks for these references! I'm not using those frameworks (Moo etc), but the Data::Printer suggestion is intriguing
[12:53:12] <mst> ggherdov: if you're writing OO code and not using one of those, you're basically banging rocks together :D
[12:53:32] <mst> as of the last ten years or so, they're not so much 'frameworks' as 'how you do OO in perl'
[12:53:33] <El_Che> mst: don't take away his rocks
[12:53:43] <ggherdov> ahah it's noted. I'll look at that
[12:53:53] <mst> nothing wrong with banging rocks together, I'm not anti-troll-drummer
[12:55:05] <El_Che> somewhere in the past, a guy wrote Moo banging rocks together

[21:20:03] <djerius> mst: it's a simple problem.  read job params from db, fork workers to do jobs, record exit status for debugging/rerunning.  These are one-shot analysis runs, not something that needs to be up and running continuously. I've used ForkManager in the past; just looking for current state of the art..  I'd use GNU parallel, as the jobs are all run as external processes but I want the ability to keep track of the success of the jobs.  
[21:20:03] <djerius> Setting up something like Minion/Gearman/Beanstalk/etc is too much work.  Aha.  I just discovered the parallel --joblog & --retry-failed options.  Perhaps no need for code at all.  
[21:21:19] <djerius> Should mention, this all runs on a single beefy compute box, so no need for multiple hosts.
