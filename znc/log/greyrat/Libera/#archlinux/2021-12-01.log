[01:22:03] <kek_> so I'm still trying to install my boot loader. Again: I have 2 disks, disk A with windows and disk B with arch. A has winows EFI partition. I want to install systemd-boot into it. It shows the entry but when trying to boot  arch it tells me "mount new_root unknwon filesystem type vfat" and throws me into an emergency shell. Here is some info: https://termbin.com/0omq any tips are highly appreciated :) I'm a bit confused as to why it 
[01:22:04] <kek_> shows type=vfat (the efi is vfat but not the arch partition and for me it reads as it it thinks the arch partition is vfat). What I did was: fdisk /dev/sdb then remove all partitions, create gpt table and formatex with ext4. But I'm a noob, haven't done that in ages. So anything could be wrong. :)

[03:13:13] <vd> phantomotap I have a shared directory in /srv/foo owned by foo:foo and my users are in group foo. If I create a file with my user in this shared directory, the file will be own by user:user, making it unusable by other member of group foo. Should I use a group sticky bit or something like that, making the created files owned by someuser:foo?
[03:14:50] <jonascj> test2332 the mintwelcome.py changes a few strings and multiple schemas, maybe check all of those (line 280-284). Aare they all set to the expected values?
[03:15:32] <test2332> it a really strange issue because everything is blue even folder and menu options expect text highlight color. Which you only seem to be able to change on linux mint using welcome screen I havent found a similar setting on arch

[03:44:58] <vd> g+ws seems like a good practice for a shared folder I think

[14:39:25] <Tom^> so half accurate assumption is nvidia 2xxx and up. ryzen 5xxx and up and or intel coffe lake and up. if you dont care about battery or it being on constantly? go for it nonetheless.

[15:53:39] <grawity> it varies, some clients display suggestions, others let you keep tabbing through nicks, yet others require you to add more letters to disambiguate
[15:53:48] <Repentinus> Just press tab again. Try with 'tat'.

[15:54:13] <grawity> e.g. last time I tried, iirc the KiwiIRC webchat (which Libera uses) displays suggestions a bit like bash
[15:54:21] <tatsumaru> tried with tat but when I keep pressing tab it just keeps displaying everyone starting with tat 
[15:54:41] <grawity> guess you need to input tats[Tab] then
[15:55:07] <grawity> in the end, it doesn't matter how you enter it, as long as the message physically starts with "thenick: "
[15:55:20] <tatsumaru> grawity: yeah that works, maybe there's no possibility to choose from list on my client
[15:55:21] <grawity> there's no specific "tag" or "mention" under the hood

[15:59:26] <grawity> oh, Options > Show Formatting Toolbars lets you just hide the useless bar
[15:59:37] <kirk781> Reminds me of the time when I installed PLasma's flagship distro KDE Neon and proceeded to use Xfce on it.
[15:59:39] <Gagis> tho I noticed QT apps under wayland in Gnome got reeeeaaally weird but that might just be wayland+nvidia thing

[18:01:28] <mystiquewolf> But then i of course wanted to enlarge the root partition, not having a USB means i used grml-rescueboot and had to enlarge my /boot partition, put a Gparted ISO there, didn't work, put a Ubuntu live ISO, didn't work, but spent good amount of trying to change the ISO to decrypt my /boot, didn't succeed. Then i had the brilliant idea to reduce my /boot back again with the ISO in it and managed to break the boot partition.
[18:01:58] <mystiquewolf> Thought i was really fucked up, but then i found not one but two USB, well hidden in my own goddamn home

[18:44:11] <mystiquewolf> Do you think that building AUR packages in clean chroot is necessary? Do the pros outweigh the double installation of runtime dependencies (once in chroot, again in real system)?
[18:45:18] <bparker> if you're trying to find the minimum required packages needed, and you already have them installed, then a chroot/container/VM/etc. might be useful

[21:08:29] <mpan> currybullen: note that one does not verify a build for themselves. If that was the case, one could simply build it and be done. The idea is ensuring either that the official packages are fine (in which case you are the whistleblower) or that your own build hasn’t been based on a source that someone tampered with.
[21:08:37] <grawity> ntfs-3g honors uid= by default, because although NTFS *does* store ownership, the Windows SIDs must be manually mapped to Linux UIDs
