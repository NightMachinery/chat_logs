[00:04:10] <xmb> tercal, like this maybe, i cant test, ... http://ix.io/3QWD
[00:06:23] <xmb> you can set your vars before it in the file, then run, and see
[00:06:34] <xmb> and replace the cmd, the ip will be in $in not $cursorid

[00:11:16] <xmb> http://ix.io/3QWF - arg1 is ip to match
[00:11:21] <tercaL> and "yet2" is "get2" I think, corrected it. Set my vars at the first lines, then ran it, no output, no error here.

[00:12:57] <xmb> i with awk parse every format, its simple ?
[00:13:16] <xmb> i dont assume dynamic json that completly changes syntax, so i awk it
[00:13:29] <xmb> i also dont know jq nor am fan of margin formats like http or json
[00:14:21] <xmb> tircal ip=$1 is making $1st argument of script the ip to match... so 1. edit newest script 2. run newest script with <ip> as arg

[15:29:29] <Earnestly> Inspiration, perhaps
[15:29:50] <ormaaj> grawity: so if it's really important to run those in parallel you'll need to separate their outputs because they're going to be returning data interleaved no matter what you do
[15:29:59] <Earnestly> I would use files
[15:30:20] <grawity> yeah that's the reason the whole output gets captured into $() first

[15:31:58] <Earnestly> This is more-or-less what loglinear does
[15:32:48] <Earnestly> Or at least injects a protocol into the message
[15:33:41] <ormaaj> jjakob: yes. It has to be "correct and sanitized" shell syntax of course.
[15:33:49] <jjakob> might be safer as declare $(cmd) ?
[15:34:05] <ormaaj> won't really work
[15:34:14] <geirha> won't be any safer than eval
[15:34:25] <grawity> Earnestly: basically at this point I've so given up on caring about doing updates "correctly" that I just run `rdo -S pacman -Syu --noconfirm` and wait for the results pop out
[15:35:03] <grawity> if it breaks, it breaks
[15:35:08] <jjakob> it's "lvs --noheadings --nameprefixes -o lv_name,vg_name /dev/myvg/mylv" so I'm relying on lvs to not give me unexpected output
[15:35:15] <Earnestly> Have you tried using mitogen?
[15:35:46] <jjakob> the other option is to run one lvs per each variable I want and directly set that as the value of predefined variable names
[15:36:16] <Earnestly> grawity: However, why not gather logs from each instance into their own files?
[15:36:35] <Earnestly> There's even the possibility of wrapping up these commands in a ninja build
[15:36:56] <Earnestly> Where the result of a build produces a timestamped file
[15:37:17] <grawity> yes but I feel more like using a dumb simple bash thing for this purpose
[15:37:52] <Earnestly> Writing files can be pretty dumb, it's usually the first thing I do, in my own /tmp/subdirectory so that I can just nuke the entire thing without second thought

[15:41:36] <Earnestly> The logs can then be coloured, editted, whatever to suit and all of this without involving much brain at all

[15:42:51] <djph> pft, beat me to it Earnestly :)
[15:42:53] <ormaaj> i kinda wish openssh had a feature to create n fds on the remote side that correspond somehow to whatever fds I pass it on the client side. That's a little too magical perhaps. It would need to make the right kind of fds and somehow transfer fd state which isn't really possible for arbitrary file types.
[15:43:00] <Earnestly> Which I suggest as default, but my strategy is to make "dotfiles" normal files, and appear normally

[17:34:40] <greybot> The difference between $@ and $*: "$@" (quoted) expands to each positional parameter as its own argument: "$1" "$2" ... while "$*" expands to the single argument "$1c$2c..." where c is the first character of IFS.
