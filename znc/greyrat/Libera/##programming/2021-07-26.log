[04:07:28] <InPhase> yitz: I get to set all the development policies at my work, but I don't get to set all the timelines.  So we get some technical debt that slips in when there's no other choice.  With attention to it we keep it minimized on the new code.  There is, however, quite a lot of technical debt accumulated from past work that was never resolved, and it takes a lot of work to hack away at it.

[04:09:43] <yitz> Yeah. Tech debt does have a tendency to show up. We've got a bunch of bugs in our tracker for cleaning up tech debt. And in theory Friday is our tech debt hackathon day. I also get a *lot* of freedom from my manager to pick what I work one which..
[04:09:47] <yitz> ... often involves a lot of tech debt cleanup

[04:12:07] <InPhase> I make a point to regularly ask the programmers under me what the problems are that they're facing with the code they're working on.  I think asking for their assessment of quality issues is a strong way to assess what's in the way of ongoing work, and it's usually code they're highly motivated to fix if I can allocate them time for it.

[04:20:38] <MarkB2> Hello.  Not sure if this is the right place... if there's a better one, please let me know.  I'm using connect() on a Windows 10 platform to connect to a server and am getting connect timeouts at the first couple of attempts.  This usually means I'm doing something wrong with connect().
[04:21:06] <MarkB2> Am using ipv4 addresses... all very vanilla networking code.  Get the same problem on both Windows and Linux hosts.

[04:31:56] <MarkB2> <heh>  The first development was in Linux, both Slackware, Ubuntu, and on a Raspberry Pi.  Windows came along later.. and everything was working until maybe a few months ago.
[04:32:30] <Arahael> tried testing using ping?
[04:32:36] <MarkB2> Arahael:I ..tend.. to agree.  Please, no head bonking: my ISP is Comcast.
[04:32:49] <MarkB2> Good idea... let me check.
[04:34:04] <Arahael> your browser may also be using a proxy. (including, a transparent proxy)
[04:35:08] <MarkB2> The browser is Firefox and connections to the host are lightning fast.  pinging the host produces 11 msec delays.

[05:01:17] <MarkB2> The program needs to know the WAN-side address of the router.  To do that, it attempts a connection to checkip.dyndns.com... which takes forever to come back using connect() but comes back immediately using firefox.

[05:09:09] <Arahael> MarkB2: Sounds like they're proxying http.
[05:10:12] <MarkB2> This will sound dumb but now I'm confused.  Microsoft is proxying http, Firefox is proxying http, or Comcast is proxying http?
[05:10:31] <Arahael> I would suggest Comcast, or some other application you've installed, perhaps your antivirus.
[05:11:03] <MarkB2> This is pretty much a vanilla Win10 install.  I think the AV is Windows Defender.

[05:12:05] <Arahael> Windows Defender is a reasonable AV as far as AV goes, I think.  Yeah, I'd blame comcast.  Have you tested accessing the local LAN?

[05:12:56] <Arahael> But needing to know the WAN side address of the router is a bit weird, unless it's trying to punch a hole through the NAT.
[05:13:02] <MarkB2> At the moment, I can connect to the router... but Comcast is (oh, this explains a LOT) holding router settings remotely.
[05:14:11] <MarkB2> That's the point of this.  I've a chunk of software that talks to Second Life.  But I must supply the WAN-side address to SL so that it can "find" my home computer.  So there is a port-forward set up as part of the initialization of this contraption.
[05:14:30] <MarkB2> What I didn't write was a PnP add-on to have the port-forward set up programmatically.

[05:33:55] <InPhase> MarkB2: 3) Install netcat.  (e.g., ncat.exe which is bundled with nmap)  Then use this to attempt to connect to a netcat in listening mode on a remote server.  (Command "nc" on Linux.)  This takes your software out of the equation, and purely diagnoses your network connection.  Then you can replace each side at a time with netcat to test for guilty pieces of software.

[11:02:54] <DPA> A platform is a thing to build applications for. Those then run wherever the platform runs. A platform tends to have a somewhat stable / backwards compatible API / ABI. Most OSes have some platforms built in, MS with WinAPI & UWP, mac with it's mac speciffic & xcode stuff, etc.
[11:02:55] <DPA> Some argue that linux userspace isn't a platform, due to not providing very stable interfaces / ABI for many things, libs & dependencies can change from one version to the next. It's not a problem for OSS software though, as recompiling stuff often just works anyway. (The kernel APIs are stable, except for /sys/).

[11:33:46] <vdamewood> I kind of gave up when they expected me/someone to send a pull request.
[11:34:40] <W> xeno, that's specific to Oracle, presumably, being the publishers of JDBC. psql presumably uses its own proprietary things, sure, but I'm talking about /what psql outputs/ here. If you tell it to dump a database as create table statements and inserts, do the create table statements and inserts conform to a specific SQL standard? Which? Is this the same for every engine? Etc.
[11:35:45] <xeno> aha, in that case, definitely not
[11:36:33] <Arahael> Every databases uses it's own dialect.
[11:37:00] <W> even further, I would like abstracted /what a typical database admin/ would do; some would presumably use the default config, and get one thing, others might prefer specific configs (e.g. tightening standards compliance? generally a common setting on MySQL) and so on, so you might have two configs "MySQL bare" "MySQL <distro's config>" etc
[11:37:32] <xeno> but no, it's not specific to Oracle - every database have its own specific JDBC driver developed by the database team, using their own proprietary underlying protocols. The only shared JDBC thing Oracle maintains is the interface specification
[11:38:00] <W> basically, I'd like to see if anyone, anywhere in the world, having set up their testing of variety of engines, have cleaned up and shared what they did, and turned it into a FOSS project
[11:38:06] <xeno> and then there's ofc ODBC, which is another standard again

[11:38:32] <W> xeno, I presumed you meant oracle's command line client
[11:38:40] <W> (and *it* using JDBC)
[11:39:14] <xeno> hmm... you could maybe try to take a look at the source for Jetbrains DataGrip, if it's available
[11:39:15] *** saribro is now known as swinnenb
[11:39:30] <W> I'm fine with JDBC on the actual query side, that's what I'm using, I'm just wanting to test for a variety of DBA personalities too
[11:40:43] <xeno> nah, was thinking of SQL Developer (which is also used for DB admin), the other admin things they have is a web interface and the command line client which I guess is developed with their proprietary SQL language extension for C or something
[11:40:43] <W> ah neat - it probably uses JDBC for most things, but it probably has some custom engine coding too, if it can get the query plan and so on
[11:41:33] <xeno> what SQL leads to what query plans are very different on different databases. When you get to DB/2, the true nightmare begins :)

[12:47:10] <W> alycidyne, it's a bit more mathematical than that as I understand it, and probably don't entirely fit programmer notions

[13:02:43] <edk> if i could choose between sqlite, and something that was 100x slower but had type checking, i'd always take the latter
[13:03:13] <DPA> sqlite also has foreign key verification disabled by default, make sure to turn it on. There is also the problem that only 1 client can write to it, and while doing so, nothing else can be done with it (not even reading).
[13:03:46] <deniska> Arahael: mysql and sqlite differ a lot that sqlite will preserve any data you throw in it, while mysql may mangle or truncate it, with default settings :)

[13:09:58] <GeDaMo> I used Berkely db for a uni project

[13:10:49] <edk> why not?
[13:10:54] <vdamewood> He said most people don't realize that it counts.
[13:10:57] <edk> any program can exist in library form
[13:11:11] <vdamewood> pyzozord: That's my main way of developing things.
[13:11:25] <vdamewood> edk: BTW, are you e?
[13:11:28] <edk> yes
[13:11:29] <beaky> yes berkeleydb was the inspiration for sqlite when the guy wondered 'why cant a relational database just be a library too'
[13:11:48] <W> pyzozord, sqlite, hsqldb, etc that has already been mentioned are also just libraries
[13:12:00] <vdamewood> Excelent.
[13:12:21] <deniska> the real question is why didn't anyone convert postgresql to a library? :)
[13:12:35] <vdamewood> libpq?
[13:12:37] <GeDaMo> A library API is just one way of communicating with other code
[13:13:09] <vdamewood> Actually, I guess that's just a client library. No 'library' for the server.
[13:13:20] <W> I think the key distinction here is in-process execution only

[22:00:25] <pyzozord> how do scientists earn money?
[22:00:36] <pyzozord> so that they can keep working on their science?
[22:00:45] <sandman13> grants pyzozord
[22:00:53] <src> paid by universities, r&d deparments, and/or grants
[22:00:58] <src> *departments
[22:00:59] <sandman13> the biggest source of bias
[22:02:16] <GeDaMo> They probably spend more time filling in grant applications than doing research :/
[22:02:16] <sandman13> Company X gives grants for research. Research shows result that is against the company's plan. Can't tell so because you don't get that grant.
[22:02:50] <src> at&t's bell labs paid a lot of scientists to do stuff simply because they had the money due to the telephone monopoly
[22:02:56] <pyzozord> so those grants are just govermental funding right?
[22:03:09] <GeDaMo> No, they can come from all sorts of sources
[22:03:17] <src> where is it where they have to make a mission statement about what they're doing for diversity in order to get funding?
[22:03:20] <src> canada I think :P
[22:03:41] <sandman13> pyzozord: The situation is so bad that you can almost hear "we paid scientists to do our bidding" when you hear the word "grant"
[22:03:56] <pyzozord> I know that at&t had monopoly and mandate to spend 1% of their budget on research which they spent on bell labs. So that was essentially paid by government (aka by taxes)
