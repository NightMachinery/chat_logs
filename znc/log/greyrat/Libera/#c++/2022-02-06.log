[02:25:13] <Alipha> linext: to start with, `AddElements(T arg){element=arg;}` pointlessly default constructs element and then assigns (copies) arg into element. Whereas `AddElements(T arg) : element(std::move(arg)) {}` directly constructs element by moving (not copying) arg into it. Always prefer member initialization lists instead of assignment, and move instead of copy when you can.

[02:29:15] <Alipha> And in main, I moved these 3 strings, `string str_element1, str_element2, type;` outside of the for loop to avoid constructing and destroying those strings every loop. Normally, it's best practice to create your variables as close to where you use them, but if that's inside a loop, you'll be allocating and deallocating every loop.

[03:19:17] <RandomReader> senoraraton - as background information to reason about this sort of thing, "{12,12,12}" isn't a "thing" on its own, i.e. not a vector or anything else, just plain syntax .. so for "foo({12,12,12})" the compiler starts by looking for a function named foo, that accepts one parameter, with that parameter being of a type that will accept that syntax to initialize with

[03:29:56] <Eelis> glossing over the fact that this particular syntax favours one particular sequence type is what causes confusion
[03:30:40] <RandomReader> what confusion? senoraraton is new and isn't even dealing with auto variables or examining the syntax as a unit yet
[03:31:55] <Eelis> there's tons of confusion in C++ because initializer lists are complex and people don't understand their special relationship to std::initializer_list. pretending no such special relationship exists is going to worsen that confusion
[03:32:12] <Eelis> better to be honest up front than to try noble lies
[03:32:36] <RandomReader> and what part of any of the previous conversation even remotely comes near this complexity or special relationship?
[03:32:55] <RandomReader> I certainly haven't lied about anything
[03:33:41] <Eelis> "{12,12,12}" isn't a "thing" on its own, i.e. not a vector or anything else, just plain syntax    <- this obviously glosses over the existence of the special relationship between initializer lists and the type of variable they naturally become: std::initializer_list
[03:33:45] <RandomReader> I'm mostly still waiting on the test case to be more specific about the actual problem, this is just some background about the error message
[03:34:06] <RandomReader> how does it gloss over anything? it *is* just syntax, which is why the compiler refers to it that way
[03:34:28] <RandomReader> it only becomes a std::initializer_list in specific contexts, same as initialization of any other type
[03:34:40] <Eelis> it's not just syntax, it is syntax that has a special tendency to become std::initializer_list, which directly contradicts the misleading suggestion you're giving there
[03:34:59] <RandomReader> what is this special tendency you're referring to?
[03:35:24] <RandomReader> I'm only aware of the one special case for   auto foo = ...   and the overload resolution preference for functions

[03:37:15] <Eelis> eh?
[03:37:18] <RandomReader> senoraraton - in that case, perhaps it's just that the foo() it found didn't accept std::vector<int> at the time

[03:47:24] <RandomReader> in the context of what you just showed, std::initializer_list<int> is simply a type that can be initialized from a braced-init-list
[03:47:27] <Eelis> which has severe consequences, for example you cannot initialize a vector with an initializer list and have the elements *move* into position
[03:47:50] <RandomReader> the only special relationship is that the "initialized" part is a language rule and not a generic type constructor
[03:47:58] <Eelis> so this std::initializer_list stuff comes up even when you think you're just initializing a std::vector
[03:48:13] <RandomReader> but that's a trait of std::initializer_list, not a trait of {1,2,3} as syntax
[03:48:14] <Eelis> you suffer the consequences of having to go through std::initializer_list
[03:48:29] <RandomReader> you seem to be shifting your original argument
[03:49:13] <Eelis> i'm telling you details about the special relationship because you seem so unaware of its nature
[03:49:21] <RandomReader> or possibly interpreting my comment about "syntax" as something else entirely
[03:49:23] <Eelis> and its consequences
[03:49:35] <RandomReader> you haven't mentioned anything I was not aware of
[03:49:49] <RandomReader> but you still seem to be wildly overselling it
[03:50:07] <RandomReader> e.g. you mentioned auto-deduced parameters originally, do you have an example case you were thinking of there?
[03:50:45] <Eelis> i didn't, "auto-deduced variables/parameters" was "(auto-deduced variables)/parameters"
[03:51:23] <RandomReader> ok, then you are taking the conversation in a direction that has nothing to do with what I was originally talking about, which is simply {1,2,3} as syntax in a function call

[03:58:39] <RandomReader> ok, aside from that one special case of placeholder deduction in a copy-initialization context, what part of what I said is incorrect or over simplified?
[03:59:00] <Eelis> we went over this already
[03:59:35] <RandomReader> the example of a function parameter *being* std::initializer_list falls under exactly what I said, "a type that will accept that syntax to initialize with"
[04:00:02] <RandomReader> and you've mentioned a lot of other traits about std::initializer_list itself, but that isn't related to the syntax at all

[04:01:50] <RandomReader> do you have another example where {1,2,3} as syntax does something different?
[04:02:54] <PJBoy> worth noting the case of `for (auto x : {a, b, c})`
[04:03:17] <PJBoy> which can't work for move only types
[04:03:49] <RandomReader> oh, yeah, that one's a subtle form of the same special case, but you wouldn't know it to look at it
[04:04:33] <RandomReader> I find that one simultaneously "not bad" in the sense of probably doing what people expect out of it, and "terrible" in the sense of subtle mechanics

[04:05:57] <Eelis> i find it purely terrible. but it's historical artifact: initializer_list comes from an era where moving was still very new and there were few move-only types to begin with
[04:07:00] <RandomReader> oh sorry, I meant the syntactical part of range-for there ... how it looks is not how it works
[04:08:44] <RandomReader> the const / can't-move constraint I'm "meh" on .. I understand the arguments, it's probably more that I haven't expected anything in particular or run into a scenario that really annoys me

[04:20:10] <Eelis> the thing with these blessed types is that unlike with other stdlib types, you can't make your own improved version of them for your own application. to get the special syntax/functionality, the language makes you use std::initializer_list, sometimes when the code doesn't even mention std::initializer_list
[04:20:42] <Eelis> that's why there's general reluctance to blessed types
[04:21:49] <Eelis> and std::initializer_list is an example where it kinda went wrong, since apparently retrofitting movability is now not easy
[04:27:59] <Eelis> as a result, C++ programmers now have to understand that when they use initializer lists, in a lot of contexts that means going through std::initializer_list, which means no moving
[04:28:10] <Eelis> which is sad :(

[14:41:44] <tesuji> I was under the impression, that a declaration "says that it will be somewhere" a definition says "its here". For const variables, isnt definition and initialisation the same?
[14:42:11] <tesuji> (outside of the question I asked earlier)
[14:42:14] <ville> const is the one that turns: int x = 1; from definition into declaration
[14:42:23] <ville> for class members
[14:43:02] <ville> well it's independent of whether there is an initializer or not: struct aa { const int x; }; is not a definition of aa::x either
[14:43:16] <tesuji> Ah I see
[14:43:19] <ville> errr...
[14:43:25] <tesuji> Nono I get you
[14:43:31] <ville> no that was competely wrong

[17:55:54] <IceMichael> la_mettrie: sure. target &= ~source;
[17:57:49] <PJBoy> (not a logical AND though)
[17:57:52] <la_mettrie> but that ~ probably costs some cpu time so it would be better to avoid it, if possible
[17:58:22] <PJBoy> it probably doesn't
[17:58:28] <la_mettrie> it doesn't?
[17:58:30] <PJBoy> lots of CPUs have a bit clear instruction
[17:59:16] <PJBoy> but even if not, cost of bitwise negation is extremely negligible
[18:00:02] <la_mettrie> but it's a rather intensively used piece of code and should be run on legacy x86 machines (maybe something like 386)
[18:00:33] <la_mettrie> still negligible?
