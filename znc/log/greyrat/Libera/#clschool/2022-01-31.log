[18:24:50] <rotateq> If I'm allowed to ask, can someone please maybe tell me how CLOSER-MOP:SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS is correctly used, or when it makes sense to specialize it on a certain class?
[18:26:46] <beach> Sure...
[18:27:03] <beach> For example, you may have a type of class that represents the slots in a very different way.
[18:27:43] <beach> Take for instance what (I think it was) Pascal Costanza did.
[18:28:22] <beach> He created a metaclass where the slots are represented as special variables.
[18:28:56] <beach> By doing it this way, he could create a thread-safe version of a macro the name of which I always forget.
[18:29:47] <beach> So for that metaclass, instead of a slot access translating into STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS the way it would for a standard class, it translates into SYMBOL-VALUE.
[18:29:56] <rotateq> Do you maybe have something to read up with that? Or I'm not yet at this level, but what sinks in slowly now and how new ones can be defined is method-combinations.
[18:30:24] <rotateq> Okay I didn't know STANDAR-INSTANCE-ACCESS yet.
[18:30:54] <beach> It assumes that the slots are stored consecutively in a vector-like way.
[18:31:30] <rotateq> Okay I try to get that. Thanks for the explanation.
[18:32:20] <beach> http://metamodular.com/CLOS-MOP/standard-instance-access.html
[18:32:58] <rotateq> Right, AMOP the ultimate source.
[18:33:34] <beach> So the method on SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS specialized to STANDARD-CLASS looks up the slot in the class metaobject, looks up the location of that slot, and then calls STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS.
[18:35:26] <rotateq> Okay makes sense, in the first place I got it that SVUC can define automatic effects on other slots if one slot is touched by a getter or setter.
[18:35:59] <beach> That would be a very unusual use for it.
[18:36:28] <beach> It would also be contrary to its specification.
[18:36:45] <rotateq> Okay then good that I asked. :)
[18:37:03] <beach> Yeah.
[18:39:23] <rotateq> Ah okay now I see, there also a class STANDARD-EFFECTIVE-SLOT-DEFINITION.
[18:40:02] <beach> Yes, instances of that one are returned by CLASS-SLOTS for a typical STANDARD-CLASS.
[18:40:53] <rotateq> Much to learn for me to get better with CLOS and MOP.
[18:45:53] <beach> I recommend you read the AMOP book.  Then, you can refer to the Metamodular website for the specification.  It is easier to read than the book.
[18:47:19] <rotateq> I may now be ready to seriously do that, maybe first finishing the book by Keene.
[18:48:08] <beach> Oh, definitely.  The AMOP book is tricky to understand.  I started twice without being able to finish.  I guess I had insufficient knowledge of user-level CLOS stuff. 
[18:48:20] <beach> The third time, it worked.
[18:48:58] <rotateq> I also read small parts already and started with the Closette implementation.
[18:49:15] <beach> Oh, OK.  You are better off than I was then.
[18:51:45] <rotateq> But you were way earlier at that level. :)
[18:53:06] <beach> I have been at it for much longer.
[18:53:32] <beach> So you are probably quicker. 
[18:53:46] <rotateq> It's a big book, as many of the other important but timeless, like PAIP.
[18:54:35] <beach> Yes.  And Alan Kay once said that the AMOP book was one of the most important books in computer science, or something to that effect.
