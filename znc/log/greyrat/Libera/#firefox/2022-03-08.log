[18:30:52] <gurkenglas> What do I need to do to make firefox's Download dialog stop asking whether it's supposed to handle the file with my script? Selecting the tickbox didn't help
[18:31:27] <gurkenglas> When I tried the same for opening .doc files with LibreWriter that worked
[18:32:04] <gurkenglas> but for .json it just opens the same dialog again, with the checkmark "Do this automatically for files like this from now on" still enabled
[18:32:34] <Caspy7[m]> gurkenglas: I think that's about the MIME type. IIRC if the MIME type isn't set correctly then "always do this" won't save
[18:35:00] <gurkenglas> Ah, okay. I've created the json file using a tampermonkey script, is URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([string],{type:"application/json"})); correct?
[18:36:28] <gurkenglas> Caspy7[m]: also something about it must be saving, after all the tick mark on "always do this" is still set the next time it asks me
[18:37:26] <gurkenglas> (and if i remove the tick mark it stays gone until i readd it, and for docx the tickmark stays off throughout that)
[18:40:32] <gurkenglas> Changing it to text/json didn't help
[18:49:57] <Caspy7[m]> perhaps there's a difference between "saving" and honoring :)
[18:49:57] <Caspy7[m]> Or maybe it just keeps the last value that was set in general on that toggle

[19:01:21] <Caspy7[m]> I don't know. Best I could do would be to do a web search - or direct you to mozilla's chat network
