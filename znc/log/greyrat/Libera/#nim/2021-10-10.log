[06:50:40] <FromDiscord> <treeform> In reply to @ajusa "Bit of a library": Writing database is really hard. You could flatty some parts of it and write things in chunks.
[06:51:09] <FromDiscord> <treeform> Personally I don't like streams or files that don't fit into memory

[09:29:33] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> what's an overriable enum?
[09:29:44] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> 1.6 adds in name smarter enums
[09:29:46] <FromDiscord> <Rika> basically having two enums called "red" wont fuck with the compiler anymore
[09:29:58] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> oh right, i thought pure already did that

[11:44:33] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Enums are type safe firstly, secondly allow packed bitsets, thirdly are nicer than using consts since they're declared together and can have a string associated with them

[11:45:49] <FromDiscord> <Rika> nah i also thought "the fuck" in my head rn
[11:46:17] <FromDiscord> <retkid> you have the variable name, a digit, and a string
[11:46:34] <FromDiscord> <retkid> tuple[0] is the digit and tuple[1] is the string
[11:46:37] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Sure but that accepts all digit/string
[11:46:38] <FromDiscord> <Rika> an enum usually maps to a choice

[22:13:45] <FromDiscord> <AlexDev> Can Nim be used in an IDE?
[22:14:58] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> Like VSCode?
[22:15:01] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> Ya
[22:15:05] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> There are a bunch of extensions
[22:15:15] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> also there is nimlsp
[22:15:58] <FromDiscord> <AlexDev> 
[22:17:15] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> Is there a way to modify the lineinfo object of a NimNode? I recall there being a `lineinfo=` proc or something like that
[22:20:04] <FromDiscord> <AlexDev> ah i just found an article on how to integrate it with different IDEs, still thanks!
