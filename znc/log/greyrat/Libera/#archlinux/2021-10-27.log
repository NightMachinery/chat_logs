[09:18:09] <kevr> lol. yeah, idk
[09:18:20] <kevr> though

[09:21:43] <kevr> On systems like, say, Ubuntu, they automatically enable services for you on install. That doesn't happen on Arch.
[09:23:08] <kevr> Good thing, too, imho: With the automatic enabling/starting of services, users may never learn about systemd or managing their services at all. This is quite an important part of the Linux infrastructure that users should be familiar with. At least Arch forces you to at least become familiar with these services (not all the time, though)
[09:23:47] <threwahway>  DHCP: dynamic IP address and DNS server assignment (provided by systemd-networkd and systemd-resolved) should work out of the box for Ethernet, WLAN and WWAN network interfaces.
[09:24:09] <kevr> threwahway: You never had the service started.
[09:24:16] <kevr> So, even if it did, it would never be able to unless you start it.

[09:29:24] <kevr> If you settle with the idea that you have to control your services specifically, you'll have a much easier time with your install. If something is enabled automatically on the iso, then okay, you learn that, but that's an extra thing they do on top of the arch system; it's not that way when you install the package from the repositories.
[09:29:25] <threwahway> now back to figuring out why video drivers work fine on one kernel and not on another, and why options that are given to me by the wiki are making the kernel say its tainted......
[09:29:44] <thurstylark> kernel taint is because blob
[09:29:47] <thurstylark> this is normal
[09:30:03] <thurstylark> it's talking about licensing, I believe
[09:30:19] <thurstylark> doesn't affect functionality

[13:14:40] <tinux> Hello. For some days, maybe weeks, now, I am experiencing window freeze-ups in several program in i3. I compared with xfce, where the same doesn't happen. For instance, in evolution, if I send an email from one account to another, right after sending, the window freezes for ~20 sec, and then again when I change to that account. I can't pinpoint the problem, the [i3-log](https://github.com/t1nux/pastebin/blob/master/i3
[13:14:40] <tinux> .log) doesn't reveal anything (to me). Any ideas what I should pay attention to?

[15:38:55] <thebombzen> I use the write functionality because it's how I put a file in a place where windows can read it
[15:39:11] <thebombzen> so I have to use the tuxera driver, which is FUSE and dropbox won't work with it, which is annoying

[17:04:01] <susi> my touchpad shows in `xinput list` as ELAN1200:00 04F3:3045 Touchpad id=11, and then I can `xinput list-props 11`, it shows e.g. "Device Enabled: 1" and libinput stuff
[17:04:53] <Alison40> nothing called a touchpad is showing up in xinput

[17:05:03] <susi> do you have libinput installed?

[17:05:17] <Alison40> yeah it's a dependency of some qt thingy

[18:27:16] <atomicwrites> Hi I was just wondering, when you create a partition you have to set the partition type to Linux LVM or Linux Root or MS Windows or whatver. Does this actually do anything? I've never seen an instance where it's required AFAIK. I tried searching fo an ansewer but all the results where about MBR vs GPT.
[18:27:36] <Foxboron> It does if you use GPT GUIDs

[18:27:46] <phrik> Title: Discoverable Partitions Specification (at systemd.io)
[18:28:01] <Namarrgon> it depends, most tools don't really care about the type too much or set the correct type themselves

[18:28:36] <jessicara> mbr was limited to a few partitions unless had a sort of extended partition which contains more partitions within it
[18:29:22] <atomicwrites> Ah right extended artitions where impolemented as a type.
[18:30:21] <atomicwrites> Foxboron: So it looks like thats a systemd feature that can mount the drives withought an fstab?
[18:30:38] <Foxboron> atomicwrites: Essentially, yes.
[18:30:42] <Foxboron> I use it for UUIDless booting

[21:21:26] <Foxboron> I do wonder if this busybox requirement is holding us back a little bit
[21:21:39] <earnestly> C is often not appropriate for such things but if one is to program in the shell as if it were C, C might as well be used

[23:05:51] <jelle> MacGyver: the throttling is super annoying on kodi :(

[23:06:19] <demonicmaniac> but it's not throttled to 70kb like ytdl is
[23:06:32] <demonicmaniac> oh yeah that sounds more like network
[23:06:55] <demonicmaniac> to be fair though when enough people have switched to yt-dlp google will just throttle yt-dlp's current hack workaround as well
