[01:30:48] <Wulf> fizzie: settimeofday does have a tz argument which I think linux does NOT ignore.

[01:48:53] <fizzie> Based on some man pages, the weird Linux-specific behavior of settimeofday with a non-null timezone argument sounds to be restricted to the special case where the *time* argument is null, so I don't think that should really come to play. And even if there's some disagreement there in terms of how the hardware clock relates to UTC time, surely that doesn't change the fact that the `struct timeval`
[01:48:55] <fizzie> argument is unambiguously a particular moment, not in any specific time zone.
[01:51:58] <Jacki> tv dont need to have a tz
[01:52:33] <Jacki> yeah some page says tz should be 0, some says null
[01:53:05] *** Quits: mitt3ns (~agent_whi@user/mitt3ns) (Quit: brb)
[01:54:00] <fizzie> Well, POSIX says it should be ignored. And the special Linux thing sounds so special you wouldn't really trip on it accidentally, since it'd only be relevant when *tv* is null.
[01:55:00] <Jacki> ok it set the wrong time anyway
[01:55:22] <Jacki> i think ill use the system command
[01:55:31] <fizzie> But what I was trying to get to is, `settimeofday(&(struct timeval){ .tv_sec = 1637619580 }, NULL)` should be setting the system's notion of current time to the specific point in time that can be written as 2021-11-22 22:19:40 UTC or as 14:19:40 PST, so it doesn't really make sense to say it's "setting UTC time" or "setting local time".

[02:04:51] <fizzie> If "time I give" meant the `struct timeval` argument, there's no way that argument can be "UTC time", or "local time". It's just a time. Time zone is meaningful for the process of converting a calendar time (like a `struct tm`) to a `time_t` value, but the resulting value isn't "UTC" or "local".

[12:42:59] <Guest9226> Hi! I'm doing the examples in the Kernighan and Ritchie book on ANSI C, and I get stuck on exercise 1-12. I wrote a program to print one word per line, and then tested it on the file containing the code. It works fine, except for the places where, in Emacs, I have used M-j to automatically indent the following line. This inserts an invisible
[12:42:59] <Guest9226> special character in the file which doesn't seem to match any of the escape characters in C. So my program doesn't see this case, and instead takes the special character for just any regular character. Does anyone know how to solve this?

[12:45:41] <dacav> Hi Guest9226.  So if I got this correctly, your program accidentally inserts a weird char in the output file?
[12:46:51] *** Joins: sord937 (~sord937@gateway/tor-sasl/sord937)
[12:47:22] <Guest9226> No, it reads its own code as a stream and outputs each word on its own line. But when it gets to a certain special character that is in the file -- the M-j from Emacs -- it fails to recognize it, and so outputs a newline (when it shouldn't).
[12:48:29] <dacav> I see.  Sorry, I'm not familiar with the exercise, so I got confused.
[12:48:48] <dacav> Well, a thing you can do is to look at the source code with a hex editor, and identify what is the weird character that emacs inserted

[12:49:31] <Guest9226> Ah, good idea! Let me do that and get back to you to see what I found.

[12:50:09] <dacav> Then you can either avoid inserting that char in the source code (it should be just ascii, in my opinion, why having anything else?)
[12:50:18] <dacav> or you can change your program to handle it specially

[13:21:49] <dave0> how much of a burden is it to put the cast (if it is even necessary in your implementation) into libc
[13:22:31] <dacav> It is mentioned in the GNU manpage for isspace(3): a signed char that is negative can be extended during the conversion to int to values that are outside the (unsigned char) range... good game
[13:23:25] *** Joins: cm007magnum (~Rheanna@101.89.150.168)
[13:23:55] <dacav> Well, while it wouldn't be technically difficult, I guess you've to deal with the momentum of legacy.  The implementation wouldn't be standard, so you've got to change the standard first, and with all of them all implementations.
[13:24:06] <dave0> as soon as someone puts a file that isn't written in english through your program everything's fucked
[13:24:22] <dacav> Instead, I'd opt for a complier warning, as there's a warning for printf-style args
[13:24:37] <dacav> Indeed
[13:24:40] <dave0> yeah i think netbsd had that
[13:24:53] <dacav> *had* that? Was it removed?
[13:25:00] <dave0> oh has
[13:25:05] <dave0> ok :-)
[13:25:11] <dacav> I wonder if things like cppcheck has it
[13:25:24] <dacav> If not, it might be worthy to send 'em a patch
[13:25:40] <rcf> Such is a good reason for platforms (when possible) to default to unsigned char. 
[13:26:14] <rcf> Use ARM and the problem goes away!
[13:27:07] <dacav> rcf: what do you mean by 'default to unsigned char'?
[13:27:25] <rcf> dacav: the standard allows 'char' itself to be signed or unsigned, defined by implementation. 
[13:27:47] <dacav> …anyway, I believe that much of the strength of C is the portability, so 'Use ARM' is probably not a good solution :D But I think you were ironic
[13:27:54] <rcf> Indeed. 
[13:27:55] <dacav> ah, I see what you mean

[13:43:50] <rcf> The true breakage only starts when you consider CHAR_BIT>8, as you can end up in a situation where (because only rank is defined, explicitly allowing for equal representation of each integer type) sizeof(int)==sizeof(char), breaking every function relying on the "well EOF can just be negative" hack. 
[13:44:39] <rcf> POSIX could fix it, but the entire idiom is too broken to bother adjusting in the proper standard. 
[13:45:03] <dave0> that's a shame cos the ctype stuff is useful
[13:45:53] <rcf> Well, it was useful. In the ASCII world. 
[13:46:43] *** Joins: System_Error (~SystemErr@user/systemerror)
[13:49:43] <rcf> Of course in practice you get around this by simply declaring that only a freestanding conforming implementation can exist in this case.

[13:52:39] <dacav> I suspect that changing CHAR_BIT might mess up with a looooot of things
[13:53:35] <dacav> Funny though: I thought that utf-8 was an (almost?) perfect backward-compatible idea.  Clearly this is an example of why I should say "almost"
[13:54:46] <dave0> i've heard of a few embedded cpu's that actually do have CHAR_BIT > 8
[13:54:55] <dave0> so it's not totally theoretical
[13:55:23] <rcf> It is indeed not theoretical. 
[13:55:54] <dacav> That might pose a embedded-developer-grade challenge
[13:56:15] <dacav> (speaking of which, OT, I'm learning yocto and I want to drawn in coffee)
[13:56:45] <rcf> That much is theoretical, as you don't get stdio at all in those cases.

[13:57:38] <dacav> Guest9226: thank you, actually
[13:58:05] <dacav> I don't quite get what you mean by the precedence problem.  I thought that isspace fixed it for you

[14:00:19] <Guest9226> In other words, there was never any problem with the special character. Like you said, M-j gives \n. But because of the way && and II are evaluated, the program read the cases in an unintended way.

I'm trying to add a GUI to a program that will read JSON entries and so on, so far I've done all the GTK4 stuff of making a GObject and GListStore and such, but now I'm working on the factories aspect of GTK4 lists. 
[16:52:44] <Satin> I'm trying to access the "title" and "author" properties I've specified in the GObject ... so that GtkWidget labels can print it, but I'm getting this error in the compiler https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/rweDfojZ/image.png

[16:58:58] <fizzie> A lot of that is GObject-specific, but for the plain C part of the question, if your `struct _BookEntry { ... }` definition is not in scope in bind_cb (since it's not in the included header, but in the implementation .c file instead), it's an incomplete type elsewhere, and you can't access any fields from it.

[17:01:51] <rcf> They tend to provide getters/setters in the OOP tradition. 
[17:02:26] <fizzie> In that case, likely you'd add a `char *book_entry_get_title(BookEntry *self) { return self->title; }` in your book-entry.c, declare that in the header, and then use `book_entry_get_title(entry)` in place of `entry->title` in bind_cb.

[19:38:58] <Learath2> tetsts: Ok here is the deal. Checking floating point numbers for exact equality just doesn’t work. So you have 3 options, you can use an epsilon comparison to check if your number is close enough. You can use < if you only want to know when the clock is past your value. Or you can use fixed point numbers. I don’t know your full problem so I don’t know what the best option is

[19:59:05] <Bou> cousteau_: even `if (number >= 1.1)` doesn't guarantee that number is >= 1.1 if the 1.1 itself got rounded down
[19:59:59] <cousteau_> then you just have to wait a little bit more so that it gets increased a little bit more over 1.1
[20:00:10] <cousteau_> this is assuming the number is constantly increasing
[20:00:30] <cousteau_> and that you don't really need to detect the EXACT moment when it reaches 1.1
[20:00:58] <cousteau_> (which is challenging enough since a float can't ever represent an exact value)
[20:01:40] <Bou> sure it can, just need to be careful to use binary representable numbers, like 1.125 (= 10^0 * 1.001)

[22:37:50] <fizzie> There's one sort of semi-material bug in the C11 draft.
[22:38:27] <omegatron> only one?

[22:39:28] <fizzie> Well, maybe there's more. But there was a comp.std.c or a comp.lang.c posting summarizing the known differences, and all the rest were really minor. And the "big" one isn't really big either.
[22:40:44] <fizzie> Specifically, N1570 6.3.2.1p2 starts "Except when it is the operand of the `sizeof` operator, the `_Alignof` operator, the unary `&` operators --" and so on, but the clause mentioning the _Alignof operator shouldn't be there (and has been removed from the final version), because the _Alignof operator isn't applicable to an expression. Likewise p3 and p4.
