[06:58:34] <chatguy> I think experiencing the real world ('out there') and pursuing your dreams is more real than sitting at a computer screen talking to randoms about crap, yes
[06:59:15] <chatguy> a real spiritual life is not to be found here, mate. this is a lower astral hell realm for the rejects of reality. welcome.

[07:00:43] <chatguy> hey Samian
[07:03:29] <chatguy> There is just Only, Simply: the Divine Self-Domain, Divine Self-Existence; the Bright itself
[07:03:41] <chatguy> That is what is always already alive. Only That -- One.
[07:04:30] <chatguy> All questions are self-caused, caused by your own presumption, your own self-contraction, your own apparent separation from the very State in which you are arising.
[07:04:41] <chatguy> That is mysterious, but it is not ultimately about Reality Itself.
[07:05:18] <chatguy> Reality Itself -- or the Very Divine -- transcends all causes and effects, all difference, all relatedness, all otherness, all separation, all egoity, all problems.
[07:05:25] <chatguy> The Universe, in fact, is utterly outshined.
[07:05:37] <chatguy> It's as if a light were shined into your eyes so brightly that there was only the light.
[07:05:50] <chatguy> How can objects be defined in an undifferentiated light? They cannot be!
[07:06:16] <chatguy> This chatroom exists in Undifferentiated Light. That's what this chatroom looks like.
[07:07:11] <chatguy> You don't see it because of POV. You don't stand in that position of all possible POVs in time and space, and therefore you don't stand in that position which is prior to time and space.
[07:07:51] <chatguy> Which is Unconditional Conscious Light. Indivisible. The Bright Itself.
[07:08:04] <chatguy> It's the only Reality; it's the condition of this chatroom.
[07:08:45] <chatguy> This chatroom doesn't exist when that Light is realised. This chatroom only exists from POV. And when the Light is found, there is no POV and there is no chatroom, other than Unconditional Light Itself.
[07:08:52] <Croran> chatguy: you seem like more of a troll than Parf is. lol. If it's so pointless to type here then why don't you stop?

[07:10:18] <chatguy> Thanks for the suggestion.

[07:11:35] <chatguy> I understand most people aren't here to do that, though. They lurk while they play games or watch videos or do their jobs. Perhaps it gives them a sense of being connected to a community.
[07:12:41] <chatguy> Do you have anything to contribute, Croran? Beyond talking about your petty urges?
[07:13:00] <chatguy> Do you have any intelligent thoughts to proffer for discussion?

[07:23:47] <Parf> eh, i tend to absorb idiosyncrasies pretty easily
[07:24:05] <chatguy> Croran Good question, brother. I think all religions have some truth to them. I think Mormonism has some greater truth to it -- in some senses -- than conventional Christian sects

[07:25:11] <Parf> calvinism is fun
[07:25:24] <chatguy> Calvinism is a natural conclusion from reading the NT at face value
[07:25:45] <Parf> exactly why it's fun
[07:26:01] <Croran> chatguy: that's a pretty vague line. belief system is one thing on paper, another in practice.
[07:26:18] <chatguy> Croran I'm happy to clarify or justify anything I say. Pls feel free to ask.
[07:26:52] <Croran> chatguy: how do you differentiate a 'belief system' from other social or traditional structures?
[07:27:21] <chatguy> to me a belief system is just that -- a system of beliefs. social and traditional structures tend to be based on belief systems.
[07:27:40] <Croran> chatguy: do you think that, for instance, your federal government is a belief structure?
[07:27:54] <Croran> assuming aussies have a federal government. seems likely.
[07:28:05] <chatguy> no, but if it is based upon a constitution then that document may codify certain beliefs
[07:28:30] <chatguy> we have no bill of rights in Australia, so I think our constitution is inferior to that of the USA
[07:28:42] <Croran> hmm.. you just gave a 'no', but then you contradicted it immediately
[07:28:44] <chatguy> not that the US government upholds the constitution (obviously not)
[07:28:55] <Croran> if the document codifies certain beliefs, how is that not a belief system?
[07:29:08] <chatguy> the government itself is obviously not a belief structure. it's a collection of people.
[07:29:15] <Croran> chatguy: ...same as the church
[07:29:24] <chatguy> the church is a group of people, yes.
[07:30:26] <Croran> so that's what i'm saying. the line between social group and 'belief system' is pretty flexible, especially in mainstream though.
[07:30:29] <Croran> thought*
[07:30:40] <chatguy> beliefs are those ideas that a person or group of people hold to be true, yes
[07:30:49] <chatguy> the people themselves are obviously not beliefs though
[07:31:03] <Croran> chatguy: ...and a belief system?
[07:31:21] <chatguy> a set of beliefs that all interrelate
[07:31:29] <chatguy> it doesn't have to be consistent, even though ppl may assert it is
[07:31:30] <Croran> chatguy: do you think that 'christianity' today is the same as 'christianity' 1500 years ago?
[07:31:39] <Croran> chatguy: do you think that the social group IS the thing?
[07:32:11] <chatguy> Good question. I wasn't around 1500 years ago. I think in some ways it would be the same. and in some ways different. to me the real question is: is Christianity today (or 1500 years ago) the same as that which was believed and practiced by the disciples of Christ?
[07:32:19] <chatguy> the social group is a social group, yes
[07:32:33] <Croran> hmm. that's not a very direct answer.
[07:32:46] <Croran> I would suggest Christianity was VERY different back then.
[07:32:49] <Parf> i'm still not sure wtf you guys are even trying to argue
[07:32:54] <chatguy> okay. tell me about it, Croran...
[07:32:55] <Croran> parf: lol.
[07:33:07] <chatguy> Parf, we are just chatting
[07:33:09] *** Joins: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.brockwell.irccloud.com)
[07:33:17] <Croran> chatguy: well martin luther was born in 1483
[07:33:17] <Parf> oh i see
[07:33:20] <Croran> chatguy: for one.
[07:33:37] <chatguy> Croran and most modern Christians don't respect Martin Luther
[07:33:43] <Croran> chatguy: wait what?
[07:33:59] <chatguy> Croran most modern Christians are Catholic and not Protestant
[07:34:05] <Croran> chatguy: what we refer to as christianity today is protestant.
[07:34:06] <chatguy> Catholic, Orthodox, Coptic
[07:34:11] <Croran> chatguy: catholics are catholig
[07:34:14] <Croran> chatguy: catholics are catholic
[07:34:16] <chatguy> Oh I don't use the word Christianity to refer to Protestant
[07:34:20] <chatguy> only Protestants do that lol
[07:34:26] <Parf> oh man, dem catholics
[07:34:35] <chatguy> I use Christianity to mean an alleged follower of Christ
[07:34:36] <Parf> i don't know that they could be counted as christian
[07:34:44] <chatguy> i.e. someone who believes Jesus is/was the Messiah/Son of God
[07:34:47] <Parf> what with all the idolatry, at the very least

[07:34:50] <ro-bot-o> [url] When Did Christians First Call Themselves ‚ÄúCatholic‚Äù? | freerepublic.com
[07:35:29] <Croran> chatguy: ok well that's, as far as I'm aware, not a common practice since... apparently the year 110 or so.
[07:35:45] <chatguy> Croran okay
[07:35:59] <chatguy> Well, obviously Protestantism is different to 500AD Catholicism :)
[07:36:11] <Croran> chatguy: it's a big history thing in the US...
[07:36:23] <chatguy> okay
[07:36:25] <Croran> chatguy: but i think the naming is worldwid
[07:36:28] <Croran> e
[07:36:40] <chatguy> I'm happy to see references on that
[07:36:47] <chatguy> I'm also happy to use whatever terminology you prefer
[07:36:51] <chatguy> I have no real attachment to labels
[07:37:04] <Croran> chatguy: http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/speed.htm
[07:37:04] <ro-bot-o> [url] Abraham Lincoln's 1855 Letter to Joshua Speed | www.abrahamlincolnonline.org
[07:37:09] <chatguy> 'Christian' was originally, I believe, a derogatory term
[07:37:24] <Croran> chatguy: specifically
[07:37:28] <Croran> "As a nation, we began by declaring that "all men are created equal." We now practically read it "all men are created equal, except negroes" When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read "all men are created equal, except negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics." When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty -- to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken
[07:37:28] <Croran> pure, and without the base alloy of hypocracy [sic]."
[07:37:29] <chatguy> hm?
[07:38:05] <chatguy> ...
[07:38:14] <Parf> that's not how it's spelled
[07:38:25] <Croran> parf: lol. what?
[07:38:29] <Parf> hypocrisy
[07:38:38] <Croran> parf: yeah... that's why it says 'sic'
[07:38:43] <chatguy> So, if I may ask, are you two 'gentlemen' believing Protestant Christians?
[07:38:44] <Croran> parf: it's the original quote, uncorrected.
[07:39:22] <Parf> me? i believe in christ
[07:39:26] <Croran> chatguy: I was raised that way. what's funny is 'protestant' as a label is considered pretty meaningless.
[07:39:39] <chatguy> it's not meaningless to me
[07:39:46] <Croran> chatguy: because there's like.... methodist, evangelical, lutheran, southern baptist... etc
[07:39:53] <Parf> i'm not a catholic nor a protestant
[07:40:20] <chatguy> Croran I understand there are many (many) Protestant denominations (sects)
[07:40:34] <Croran> chatguy: right. what i'm saying is no one really refers to themselves as protestant.
[07:40:34] <chatguy> it sort of goes with the territory of Lutheran axioms
[07:40:42] <chatguy> Croran that's fine
[07:40:46] <Parf> and by believe in christ, i mean i believe he is a conduit to god, but i don't worship christ
[07:40:56] <chatguy> Parf alright
[07:41:00] <Parf> worship is reserved for god alone
[07:41:14] <Parf> i also believe there are many ways to skin a cat
[07:41:21] <chatguy> charming
[07:41:45] <Croran> chatguy: I believe in Christ, but I would not consider myself a member of a particular sect, not even necessarily protestant.
[07:41:50] <Parf> and it wouldn't surprise me that baptisms by shamans in the jungles also are a conduit to god
[07:41:58] <chatguy> Croran thanks for clarifying
[07:43:09] <chatguy> the beliefs of any particular individual Christian will tend to align with certain sects in one way or another
[07:43:21] <chatguy> but I understand that Christianity is very heterogenous
[07:43:29] <Croran> chatguy: anyway, i'm still not understanding how you differentiate between a authority structuer and a belief system
[07:43:41] <Croran> structure*
[07:43:49] <chatguy> an authority structure is a group of people who can hurt you if you don't do what they tell you
[07:43:58] <chatguy> a belief system is a collection of ideas in people's minds
[07:44:07] <Croran> chatguy: okay, and belief systems can be like that too, if you consider the practical manifestation
[07:44:21] <chatguy> the beliefs themselves are thoughts
[07:44:27] <chatguy> the manifestation of beliefs is behaviours
[07:44:31] <chatguy> they are related but not the same
[07:44:32] <Croran> chatguy: beyond that, i consder the american declaration of independence to codify a religion.
[07:44:47] <chatguy> I wouldn't argue with you on that, Croran
[07:44:51] <Parf> "freedom" is explicitly in opposition to god
[07:44:56] <chatguy> lol
[07:45:00] <Parf> and america is very likely the great satan
[07:45:22] <chatguy> always interesting to chat with kooky pilgrims :)
[07:46:05] <Parf> i dunno man, baby sacrifice to the altar of mammon en masse seems pretty indicative of a sort of evil hive
[07:46:06] <chatguy> maybe not interesting, but amusing
[07:46:21] <chatguy> maybe. so does cutting up the genitals of those babies
[07:46:31] <chatguy> and then sending them off to become cannon fodder when they are fully grown
[07:46:41] <Parf> agreed, but i don't consider the bible to be infallible by any means
[07:47:17] <Parf> knowing what i do about translations, i don't trust it much at all, really.
[07:47:28] <Croran> I would suggest that any social organization that maintains a military has a core of beliefs that could be considered a religion.
[07:47:54] <chatguy> Croran, yes all military and monarchy and religious structures are Blue Systems in Spiral Dynamics
[07:48:05] <chatguy> i.e. according to that theory they are all the same type of structure
[07:48:11] <chatguy> authoritarian
[07:48:17] <Croran> chatguy: yeah but. i'm talking about the social organization that owns the military. not the military itself.
[07:48:34] <chatguy> the law of Christ gives liberty, so it is arguably in contradistinction to authoritarianism
[07:48:52] <Parf> the law of christ gives liberty, eh?
[07:48:59] <chatguy> according to "James"
[07:49:05] <Parf> who
[07:49:14] <chatguy> whoever wrote the book of James in the NT
[07:49:20] <Parf> oh right
[07:49:27] <Parf> he was probably wrong then
[07:49:34] <chatguy> lol maybe
[07:49:39] <Parf> most of them were
[07:49:46] <chatguy> I'm sure anyone who disagrees with you is "probably wrong then" ;)
[07:49:47] <Parf> only human after all
[07:49:52] <chatguy> just like Jesus
[07:50:03] <Parf> he probably was just human, yeah
[07:50:10] <chatguy> and no Christ
[07:50:11] <Parf> also the son of god
[07:50:17] <chatguy> whatever that means
[07:50:20] <chatguy> so was Nero
[07:50:21] <Parf> i don't see how the two are mutually exclusive
[07:50:24] <Croran> chatguy: so is being australian a belief system?
[07:50:45] <chatguy> Croran no. it's not a system or a belief. it's a label. an identifier.
[07:51:01] <chatguy> this body was born in a certain geographical region. that's all.
[07:51:12] <Croran> chatguy: hmm. is there a core of australians that believe in a belief system?
[07:51:25] <chatguy> Croran I don't understand the question
[07:51:38] <Croran> chatguy: there is an australian belief system, otherwise the state would crumble
[07:51:44] <Croran> chatguy: argue with me
[07:52:01] <Parf> climbing the greasy pole
[07:52:04] <chatguy> there's a constitution etc. and everyone in Australia has beliefs, just as in every other country.
[07:52:13] <Parf> that one's beelzebub, matter of fact
[07:52:16] <chatguy> I don't care much about 'Australia' etc
[07:52:22] <Parf> it's a sort of king of the hill monstrosity
[07:52:29] <chatguy> it's a primitive country in many ways
[07:52:38] <Parf> pretty weird to see people fight over that one though, since they keep getting into the big guy's beard
[07:52:44] <chatguy> but all countries are part of this "fallen world"
[07:52:45] <Croran> chatguy: There is a set of beliefs that the people who control the country are judged by.
[07:52:58] <Parf> then he picks them out like fleas
[07:53:00] <chatguy> Croran okay. I don't know much about that.
[07:53:07] <Parf> and then they start climbing again, so bizarre
[07:53:18] <Croran> chatguy: ok. well i'm just saying. social group vs belief system is not a clear line.
[07:53:35] *** Quits: lakitu (~lakitu@192-198-3-9.dhcp.radiolinkinternet.com) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:53:45] <chatguy> Croran. I think a social group is a group of people (human organisms). and belief system is a set of beliefs (thoughts). you're obviously free to see things differently.
[07:53:57] <chatguy> hopefully we can move beyond our definitional issues into something more substantial ;)
[07:54:07] <Croran> chatguy: i would suggest that no one complies with a given written belief system.
[07:54:15] <chatguy> probably not
[07:54:16] <Croran> chatguy: so in your definition belief systems are irrelevant
[07:54:36] <Parf> the inherent ambiguity of writing forces people to stand at odds in its interpretation
[07:54:45] <chatguy> I don't think beliefs are irrelevant at all. Humans are imperfect and erratic. Doesn't mean that beliefs don't dominate their behaviours and culture.
[07:54:49] <Parf> language is a chain, and that is the "moral" of babel
[07:54:55] <Parf> a punishment
[07:55:06] <chatguy> beliefs -> behaviours
[07:55:16] <Croran> parf: hmm. so it's a story about semantics?
[07:55:20] <chatguy> mind -> body
[07:55:32] <chatguy> thought -> action
[07:55:44] <Parf> no, it's a story about how the pursuit of power disrupts one's capacity for communication
[07:55:46] <Croran> chatguy: beliefs dominate their behaviors more than social relationships do?
[07:55:47] *** Joins: lakitu (~lakitu@192-198-3-9.dhcp.radiolinkinternet.com)
[07:55:53] <Croran> chatguy: definitely not convinced.
[07:56:35] <chatguy> Croran I'm not trying to convince. What dominates a persons behaviours is not for me to say. I think it would be quite individual. I'm sure for most people it is a mixture of beliefs and social pressures.
[07:56:53] <chatguy> in any case, both beliefs and social pressures are usually related to psychological needs
[07:57:13] <Parf> chatguy, are there any hills on which you'd die?
[07:57:22] <Croran> hahahah
[07:57:42] <chatguy> Parf probably most of them. i don't have much to live for ;)
[07:58:03] <Parf> fair enough
[07:59:02] <Parf> *collects a leaf token*
[07:59:17] <Croran> Parf: I don't know. I feel like there's more to it than that. 'pursuit of power disrupts ones capacity for communication' is pretty subtle.
[07:59:57] <Parf> eh, the tower of babel story is pluripotent
[08:00:59] <Croran> Parf: maybe, but i can't see the positive or productive outcomes of most of the ideals that can be drawn from it.
[08:01:34] <Parf> who says there was supposed to be any positive result from that story anyway
[08:01:39] <chatguy> let me know if either of you want to actually discuss Christianity
[08:02:11] <Croran> chatguy: hmm. you want to narrow the scope from social systems and belief systems to just christianity?
[08:02:18] <Parf> i'm perfectly content letting christianity as a topic evaporate entirely
[08:02:32] <chatguy> Croran if that's how you want to phrase it. sure.
[08:02:54] <Croran> chatguy: sure. what topic makes your dick hard?
[08:03:14] <Parf> eschatology
[08:03:37] <chatguy> Croran I'm interested in philosophy and religion. But I haven't really understood much of what you two are talking about.
[08:03:56] <Parf> feel free to ask me to clear up anything i've said thus far
[08:03:56] <Croran> chatguy: oh on the babel story?
[08:04:15] <chatguy> Croran Happy to discuss the Babel story, but that is more Judaism, or even something older
[08:04:27] <chatguy> it's an ancient myth to explain human languages
[08:04:33] <Croran> chatguy: well that's what we were discussing. no?
[08:04:35] <chatguy> and also Key 16 in the Tarot
[08:04:45] <Croran> chatguy: arguably.
[08:04:45] <chatguy> Croran I don't know what you are discussing, mate
[08:04:55] <Parf> is the tower derived from babel?
[08:05:06] <chatguy> The Tower IS the tower of Babel
[08:05:11] <Parf> huh!
[08:05:15] <chatguy> hence the Hebrew letter of Key 16 is Peh
[08:05:21] <chatguy> (mouth)
[08:05:28] <Parf> cool
[08:05:29] <Croran> chatguy: what does mouth have to do with tower?
[08:05:34] <chatguy> Babel
[08:05:39] <Croran> chatguy: ah. huh.
[08:06:05] <chatguy> Babble
[08:06:16] <chatguy> the story of the tower of Babel is about human language
[08:06:58] <chatguy> I'm gonna swwiiiing from the Chandelier!!!!! IIIIIII"''''mmm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist! Like it doesn't exxxissssst!
[08:07:10] <Parf> ok wittgenstein
[08:07:15] <Croran> that's an abrupt transition
[08:07:22] <Parf> ook ook

[08:07:58] <Croran> chatguy: ok it's a story about human language? that's a pretty bad interpretation.

[08:08:18] <Parf> Le lait est pour la chatte
[08:08:23] <chatguy> Croran It's about whatever you want it to be about, brother
[08:08:35] <chatguy> it's about 'God' being a prick (like most of the Bible) ;)
[08:08:51] <Parf> hey man, god isn't a prick
[08:08:55] <Croran> chatguy: well that's the question. what is God trying to tell us.
[08:09:01] <chatguy> the real God isn't a prick. but the Jewish God is
[08:09:17] <chatguy> God is trying to tell us to grow up and stop being mentally enslaved
[08:09:19] <Parf> adonai? he seems a bit grumpy
[08:09:26] <chatguy> YHWH
[08:09:32] <chatguy> Your Way
[08:09:39] <chatguy> I am the Way
[08:09:47] <Croran> like... we shouldn't cooperate with others to build a tower to heaven?
[08:09:58] <chatguy> lol if that's what you take from it
[08:10:06] <chatguy> Orange Man Bad
[08:10:06] <Parf> seems like a safe bet not to attempt to build a space elevator
[08:10:16] <Croran> parf: lol.
[08:10:33] <Croran> parf: yeah imagine how many languages we could have if we tried that.
[08:10:55] <Parf> the singularity will provide us all with a new language fairly soon anyway
[08:11:03] <Croran> chatguy: orange man... what are you on about?
[08:11:18] <chatguy> Croran Trump Tower, mate
[08:11:19] <Parf> a compulsory language that is instantly integrated neuronally upon any sensorial observation
[08:11:33] <Croran> chatguy: as if trump tower is a space elevator? or particularly tall?
[08:11:41] <chatguy> Croran as if
[08:11:46] <Croran> lol.
[08:11:48] <Parf> also, it'll be an unambiguous language so we won't be able to use it for deception
[08:11:57] * Parf rubs his hands together in satisfaction
[08:12:04] <chatguy> towers are phallic objects that represent human power
[08:12:09] <chatguy> that was Babel and Trump Tower
[08:12:17] <chatguy> I like Trump. Not much of a Babel man though
[08:12:24] <Parf> i too am a fan of trump
[08:12:32] <Croran> why?
[08:12:33] <chatguy> I'm a better fan than you are
[08:12:46] <Parf> watching the debates was like watching two iterations of my grandfather arguing with each other
[08:12:52] <arcturus> maybe the phallic stuff is in the eye of the beholder
[08:12:55] <chatguy> the debates were gold
[08:12:59] <arcturus> its just a building
[08:13:01] <Parf> cmon man
[08:13:09] <Croran> chatguy: you literally just like talk and to hear people talk
[08:13:12] <chatguy> arcturus it's just a phallus
[08:13:20] <chatguy> Croran yes to the first part
[08:13:33] <Parf> imagine if your cock were the root of all language, my goodness. also, lel, root.
[08:13:41] <chatguy> I like to hear myself talk. not so much others.
[08:13:45] <Croran> lol
[08:13:49] <Croran> at least you're honest about it
[08:13:52] <chatguy> words are creative seeds
[08:14:09] <Parf> words are chains
[08:14:23] <arcturus> it could be an association youre making subconsciously
[08:14:23] <Croran> Trump had some good words, didn't he?
[08:14:27] <arcturus> trump, phallic
[08:14:31] <chatguy> Croran for sure
[08:14:42] <Croran> "Look. Having nuclear..."
[08:14:42] <Parf> it's not hard to connect tower with phallus
[08:14:51] <chatguy> arcturus have you been tested for autism?
[08:14:53] <Parf> heh, hard
[08:15:25] <Parf> speaking of the tower of babel, schism is a great song
[08:15:56] <Croran> oh and who can forget, "You're Fired!"
[08:16:09] <chatguy> Croran You're obviously not a fan. All good.
[08:16:17] <chatguy> I know Trump, like Christ, is a divisive man
[08:16:21] <chatguy> :P
[08:16:28] <Croran> chatguy: why do you think that? because I quote him?
[08:16:46] <chatguy> Croran just my impression. happy to be corrected.
[08:16:57] <Parf> do you enjoy pugilism, chatguy
[08:17:06] <chatguy> Parf what is that? boxing?
[08:17:09] <Parf> yarp
[08:17:12] <chatguy> no
[08:17:17] <Parf> i see
[08:17:30] <chatguy> I enjoy sparing with other intelligent people
[08:17:39] <chatguy> sparring? ;)  lol
[08:17:41] <chatguy> the irony
[08:17:49] <Parf> fists contain the language of the heart, you'll find
[08:17:57] <chatguy> if you say so, mate
[08:18:08] <Parf> try it some day, it's a rush
[08:18:17] <arcturus> we are not mere apes to have to resort to our fists
[08:18:19] <Croran> I tried once. got my tooth chipped.
[08:18:31] <arcturus> its about using our reason
[08:18:31] <Parf> shoulda drank more milk
[08:18:35] <Croran> lol
[08:18:44] <Parf> it's not about resorting to fists, it's the praise of the triumph of the fist
[08:18:47] <Croran> shoulda worn a mouth guard i guess.
[08:18:51] <chatguy> Parf is ranking on others for their base urges and yet he likes a good rush ;)
[08:19:10] <Parf> asceticism is the greatest rush one can experience, tbh
[08:19:28] <arcturus> isnt asceticism just cowardice
[08:19:33] <arcturus> opting out of the game
[08:19:34] <chatguy> then you must have experienced them all, Parf
[08:19:52] <Parf> yeah, i've lived a life of enviable vagaries
[08:19:56] <chatguy> asceticism is far from cowardice. only an idiot would say that.
[08:20:09] <chatguy> Parf and not much to show for it
[08:20:22] <Parf> oh, you wouldn't know from what i present on some shitty chatroom
[08:20:31] <chatguy> Park I wouldn't
[08:20:42] <Parf> it'd take a deft eye ;)
[08:20:46] <Croran> is Parf your real name?

[08:20:59] <chatguy> I'm more daft than deft
[08:21:16] <Parf> croran, no.
[08:21:18] <Parf> my name is Joe
[08:21:25] <chatguy> but I get the feeling Cronan is very handsome
[08:21:25] <Croran> oh. not as exciting.
[08:21:28] <Croran> haha
[08:21:34] <chatguy> Joe the plumber
[08:21:42] <Parf> no, joe the writer
[08:21:43] <Croran> chatguy: thanks. I'd like to think so.
[08:21:46] <chatguy> I thought Cronan was the one obsessed with tubes
[08:21:55] <chatguy> Croran just my feeling

[08:37:45] <Croran> i never saw that. had no idea third day did the sound track.
[08:37:47] <chatguy> because that is what your Christ endured
[08:38:28] <Parf> tbh it's pretty badass to be able to even survive that many lashes. 10 can kill a man
[08:39:37] <chatguy> I have no doubt

[08:42:15] <chatguy> that is what your Christ allegedly endured for your sake
[08:42:26] <Croran> chatguy: one man's interpretation
[08:42:33] <chatguy> that is what the entire New Testament revolves around
[08:42:44] <chatguy> the torture, death, and resurrection of a blood sacrifice
[08:43:08] <chatguy> you think Jesus wasn't flogged to within an inch of his life?

[08:44:57] <Croran> chatguy: but you didn't want to understand

[08:45:11] <chatguy> it's crass

[08:59:19] <biys> they already have their 2.5 kids
[08:59:25] <biys> they said they did still have sex

[08:59:56] <chatguy> biys where in the Bible does it say lust is bad?
[09:00:11] <Parf> the trick is to just observe the natural fertility cycle of the woman, biys
[09:00:15] * derpadmin threw his bible 20+ years ago
[09:00:18] <chatguy> Croran philosophical ideas? lol you talked about drilling holes, mate. you're a disgrace. you should be ashamed of yourself.
[09:00:23] <Croran> chatguy: where in the bible does it explain what 'desires of the flesh' are?
[09:00:30] <derpadmin> that book told me I was not going to heaven
[09:00:34] <chatguy> Cronan you don't know?
[09:00:36] <derpadmin> enough red
[09:00:38] <biys> well actually yah there is.  in matthew 5 it said something like: "you've been told not to commit adultery?  well i tell you that if a man even looks at a woman lustfully he will be judged"
[09:00:41] <Croran> chatguy: you asked us to quiz you.
[09:00:49] <Croran> chatguy: wow you are a true troll
[09:00:56] <biys> so the act of sex that isn't associated with procreation is lustful in nature
[09:01:00] <chatguy> Galatians 5:19
[09:01:06] <biys> which would mean that you don't have your eyes truly on god
[09:01:10] <biys> you're allowing "sin"
[09:01:16] <chatguy> biys where in the Bible does it say that?
[09:01:17] <biys> which is essntially just missing the mark

[09:01:47] <chatguy> no, biys
[09:01:49] * Parf raises an eyebrow at that interpretation
[09:01:50] <chatguy> that's about adultery
[09:02:03] <biys> no it isn't... it's about the lengths you must go to follow god
[09:02:07] <chatguy> married sex is the opposite of adultery
[09:02:11] <chatguy> you idiot

[09:02:28] <chatguy> yeah I've read it, mate

[09:02:55] <biys> the entire chapter is about how to live the most holy life
[09:02:57] <derpadmin> no you did not
[09:03:10] <derpadmin> correct biys
[09:03:11] <chatguy> there is nothing about married sex in Matthew 5
[09:03:16] <chatguy> if you think there is then quote it
[09:03:19] <chatguy> you stupid little man
[09:03:42] <derpadmin> he just did chatguy
[09:03:51] <Croran> chatguy: and leviticus 18:6-21,23 describes fornication
[09:03:52] <chatguy> he quoted a verse about ADULTERY
[09:03:58] <chatguy> that is the OPPOSITE of married sex
[09:04:05] <Croran> chatguy: so... married sex doesn't enter into it.
[09:04:09] <chatguy> how many times do I need to say that, derpadmin? are you as dumb as your name?
[09:04:15] <Parf> and herein lies my case for words being chains, ambiguity reigns, and the spirit suffers
[09:04:19] <chatguy> Croran what do you think?
[09:04:25] <derpadmin> you don't get it chatguy do you?
[09:04:28] <Croran> chatguy: i just told you
[09:04:34] <derpadmin> it was crystal clear
[09:04:35] <chatguy> there is no ambiguity about the definition of adultery
[09:04:43] <chatguy> Cronan you told me what?
[09:04:50] <Croran> chatguy: what i think.
[09:05:01] <Parf> no, i'm saying that his interpretation is a sign of the ambiguity of the words themselves
[09:05:01] <chatguy> Croran okay. please feel free to repeat it. I don't know what you said.
[09:05:15] <Croran> chatguy: you told me galatians 5:19. I told you leviticus 18:6-21,23
[09:05:16] <biys> chatguy: what the verse is essentially saying is...  you've heard of adultery right?  as in... you've seen someone do a blackflip right?  well i'll tell you what...  the thriple backflip is actually how you go about it
[09:05:18] <chatguy> Parf there is no ambiguity about the definition of adultery, unless you're a dullard
[09:05:24] <biys> it's a matter of one-upping the current understanding of pure
[09:05:33] <biys> and seeting the threshhold so far out there
[09:05:34] <Parf> there are many dullards

[09:05:58] <derpadmin> context is everything chatguy, I suggest you go re-read matthew
[09:06:11] <biys> i would suggest you re-read matthew 5 entirely
[09:06:18] <derpadmin> indeed
[09:06:18] <chatguy> derpadmin perhaps you can explain the "context" of "adultery" lol
[09:06:30] <biys> you're hung up on a word
[09:06:30] <derpadmin> just go re-read the damn thing chatguy
[09:06:33] <biys> a single word
[09:06:37] <derpadmin> you did not get the context
[09:06:40] <biys> and misinterpreting the entire context of the conversation
[09:06:43] * Parf rests his chin against the heel of his palm
[09:06:44] <derpadmin> it is not only about adultery
[09:06:53] <derpadmin> it is about being holy
[09:06:57] <chatguy> derpadmin I'm not going to do what you order me to do in lieu of you justifying your silly statements
[09:07:19] <derpadmin> ok then, keep misunderstanding the very book you quote

[09:07:39] <biys> "bad" in what sense?
[09:07:44] <biys> i'm not sure what you mean by "bad"
[09:07:45] <chatguy> you called it a sin
[09:07:55] <biys> what is a sin?
[09:08:00] <I_Am_M00t> hi biys
[09:08:00] <Parf> well, this is going nowhere fast
[09:08:02] <chatguy> you tell me mate. you said it
[09:08:05] <biys> what does it mean to sin?
[09:08:18] <chatguy> usually it means to contravene a law in the Bible
[09:08:23] <I_Am_M00t> im not gonna read matthew 5 thank u
[09:08:31] <biys> sinning is a matter of missing your mark.  it's a matter of an idea that there is a MOST APPROPRIATE WAY to live within time and space
[09:08:40] <biys> and when you don't live up to that expectation
[09:08:44] <biys> you're missing your mark
[09:08:49] <biys> and that is what it means to sin
[09:08:52] <chatguy> biys it's fine for you to have your own spiritual ideas of what is good and bad, but you aren't quoting the Bible
[09:09:04] <arcturus> youve missed the mark with that definition, imho
[09:09:09] <chatguy> there is no condemnation of married sex in the Bible
[09:09:24] <chatguy> you have confused adultery with married sex. they are opposites.
[09:09:36] <derpadmin> You say, ‚ÄúFood for the stomach and the stomach for food, and God will destroy them both.‚Äù The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
[09:09:36] <biys> i'm fine with you saying whatever you say
[09:09:44] <biys> but this conversation won't progress further
[09:09:47] <biys> which i am also fine with
[09:09:49] <derpadmin> Corinthians 6:13
[09:09:50] <biys> i wish you a good day
[09:09:52] <arcturus> adultery and adulting are distinct ideas
[09:09:56] <I_Am_M00t> the bible sez
[09:09:58] <chatguy> derpadmin doesn't mention married sex, you fool
[09:10:17] <derpadmin> it does not mention unmarried sex either
[09:10:18] <chatguy> sexual immorality is the opposite of married sex, you idiot
[09:10:19] <derpadmin> you fool
[09:10:31] <derpadmin> you idiot
[09:10:37] <derpadmin> dumb dumb man
[09:10:40] <chatguy> St Paul tells them to get married rather than burn with lust
[09:10:44] <chatguy> lol
[09:10:48] <biys> is uh... audrey not around anymore?
[09:10:49] <chatguy> how pathetic
[09:10:53] <arcturus> you cant go around calling people a dumb dumb
[09:11:13] <derpadmin> he keep on calling me idiot... I sure can
[09:11:21] <chatguy> okay I'll read those verses now Cronan

[15:07:13] <arryana> can't say i know enough about the politics to comment intelligently
[15:08:06] <blkshp> It's about the same as Brexit (but reversed) about 55% want to remain as part of the UK with the rest wanting to leave.

[20:41:51] <Franciman> hi all, I am reading also sprach zaratustra
[20:41:54] <Franciman> zarathustra
[20:50:58] <plankers> good book
[20:51:03] <plankers> i like the part about the chimera
[20:53:16] <Franciman> plankers: I read the prologue
[20:53:34] <Franciman> I really liked the escamotage of zarathustra saying, wait I can't speak to all the people
[20:53:39] <Franciman> I need to speak who can understand
[20:53:52] <Franciman> and so the rest of the book contains his lessons
[20:53:57] <Franciman> and only who wants to follow reads them
[20:54:00] <Franciman> ahah
[20:54:17] <Franciman> I don't quite understand the figure of the clown in the prologue
[20:54:26] <Franciman> I thought maybe it represents bad reputation
[20:54:31] <Franciman> and jokes from the others
[20:54:36] <Franciman> that make you not credible
[20:54:58] <Franciman> and dead to toe community, when you become a clown
[20:55:02] <Franciman> the*
[20:55:03] <Franciman> but not sure
[20:55:06] <Franciman> they say it is the devil
[20:55:09] <plankers> its a bit solipsistic in the end, but ya know
[20:55:13] <plankers> lots of good stuff in there
[20:55:32] <Franciman> was he getting a little bit insaner?

[20:55:51] <plankers> nah nietszche was still quite lucid when he wrote it
[20:56:08] <plankers> along with the geneology of morality its one of his best works
[20:56:28] <plankers> tbh id start with the geneology, its much shorter

[22:13:20] <Franciman> do you also know any commentary book on zarathustra which could be nice to read?
[22:13:29] <phasmatodea> i do not, sorry
[22:13:47] <phasmatodea> im sure theres plenty of interpretations out there
[22:13:47] <Franciman> ehy no prob
[22:13:54] <phasmatodea> nietszche has a way of being polarizing
[22:13:58] <Franciman> lol
[22:14:00] <Franciman> i like it
[22:14:11] <Franciman> on one side I hate that there is no unique interpretation
[22:14:14] <Franciman> on the other side it is fun
[22:14:17] <Franciman> it makes you think more
[22:14:29] <phasmatodea> as long as you dont take it in the jew-hating direction, you should be fine
[22:15:18] <Franciman> ahah
[22:15:30] <Franciman> ah you mean that one interpretation is that the last man is the jewish
[22:15:37] <Franciman> and the ubermensch is the arian german?
[22:16:00] <Franciman> I think this is what he criticizes somehow
[22:16:16] <Franciman> but he is very vague so

[22:39:08] <phasmatodea> my own interpretation is that the ubermensch isnt a man at all, but the collective intelligence were building together through our networked computers
[22:39:28] <phasmatodea> if we ever achieve general purpose AI, thatll be the ubermensch
[22:39:53] <phasmatodea> heres hoping it likes us
[22:40:06] * Panther is an Uberpanther
[22:41:12] <phasmatodea> one would imagine that any such being would have a certain fondness for its creator, assuming we create it in our image
[22:41:15] <phasmatodea> but really who knows
[22:42:21] <phasmatodea> nietzsche is quite clear that the ubermensch will _not_ be a humantho. it will be an evolutionary step past humanity

[22:53:04] <phasmatodea> :)
[22:53:09] <Franciman> thanks for your precious opinion :)
[22:53:17] <phasmatodea> i wouldnt call it precious lol
[22:53:25] <Franciman> for me it was
[22:53:30] <phasmatodea> well thanks
[22:53:39] <Franciman> because you didn't impose it on me
