[00:00:08] <galambo> when I was in the army we used to make our own bread. I remember some people sometimes put strawberry jam in the dough and it tasted delicious
[00:00:41] <galambo> maybe strawberry jam in sourdough bread would make it sweet and sour?
[00:00:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> The food processor, as it mixes up the dough, heats up. The motor heats up, and with it the axle, and the bowl... and the contents...
[00:00:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... enough, as it turns out, to kill the starter.
[00:02:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> The doughs with the instant yeast worked because, it seems, S. cerevisae is more heat-tolerant, and because the yeast is dry to begin with... so it survived. But the wild yeast in my starters - died...
[00:03:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess what I've learned is that I need a bigger machine, and/or a standing mixer... neither of which is happening until such time as I get a new place with more storage space -_-
[00:05:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Relatedly, many bread guides say to ferment bread, esp. sourdough, at lower temperatures, by which they mean 35-50 °F. But I have no access to such a temperature range! The coldest part of my kitchen is well over 70°F, and my fridge doesn't rise above 30°F...)
[00:07:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> tl;dr biology is annoyingly complicated, eating living things is highly inconvenient; if only they weren't so delicious

[00:09:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo: As for jam, well, the sugar in the jam would have pretty much the same effect as sugar from any other source (plain white sugar, honey, whatever), namely a faster rise; that usually results in a more neutral bread, as the dough has less time to ferment and produce acids; the acid in the jam would likely have other effects... hard to say

[05:15:15] <vrs> then I read ahead a bit and skip around in the comments and notice that yeah, noncartesian AIs is also a thing that's been thought about
[05:16:13] <vrs> and some comment of yud's to the effect of "yeah but we don't expect those to be as tractable"
[05:17:38] <vrs> so credit to him, at least not a total blind spot, and it raised my estimates of what random important bits he left in some comments somewhere
[05:21:20] <vrs> hm, then again, I would probably ask "why should we worry when the lebowski theorem exists"

[07:37:28] <feepbot> Twitch leaks - sizeof(cat) (Twitch leaks)
[07:39:07] <ivan> "Their community is also a disgusting toxic cesspool, so to foster more disruption and competition in the online video streaming space, we have completely pwned them, and in part one, are releasing the source code from almost 6,000 internal Git repositories"
[07:40:52] <PapuaHardyNet> "I dislike the users of a platform so I will attempt to kill the platform
[07:40:54] <PapuaHardyNet> "
[07:41:22] <PapuaHardyNet> tbh the only reason I'm downloading the twitch leak is to get access to those 6000 repositories
[07:41:27] <nshepperd2> i have seen hearsay that they have (they claim) actually decrypted all of the passwords and are gonna release them in part 2
[07:42:00] <PapuaHardyNet> probably already sold off to the highest bidder on the dark web
[07:42:02] <nshepperd2> which would sure be an indictment of twitch if it was true. doubt though
[07:42:14] <PapuaHardyNet> part 1 may be proof of work, part 2 may be the payload with which they make money
[07:42:26] <rmmh> given source code you can dig up the password hashing functions
[07:42:47] <rmmh> it's unclear that stolen user passwords are worse than bank account information for all these people
[07:43:45] <adiabatic> ivan: so are these 4channers or tumblrinas
[07:44:00] <rmmh> 4chan
[07:44:24] <adiabatic> "disgusting toxic cesspool" is SA- or Tumblr-speak, though. interesting
[07:44:25] <PapuaHardyNet> tumblrinas can't hack
[07:47:26] <saturn2> i don't think tumblrs say "cesspool"
[07:54:20] <quanticle> The payout data is probably more interesting than their codebase

[07:58:57] <adiabatic> that said, he's really good at feeling the news at you, so I can see how he has the following he has
[07:59:23] <ggreer> I'm surprised so many gun owners are mistaken about how striker-fired pistols work. some (such as glocks) push the sear back to fully cock the striker, then drop the sear: https://i.imgur.com/8lQ6Der.mp4 others (such as sigs and walthers) just drop the sear: https://i.imgur.com/E0asAwq.mp4
[07:59:30] *** Quits: lizzie (~alex@meowface.org) (Quit: leaving)
[07:59:57] <ggreer> the former is safer because the striker is (hopefully) not cocked back enough to detonate the primer if the sear falls due to some malfunction (dropping, metal shearing, etc)
[08:00:21] <ggreer> but a lot of gun owners think that all striker fired pistols use the first design, when in fact it's mostly just glocks
[08:01:41] <ggreer> this is not hard to verify. you simply disassemble your gun and pull the trigger

[08:53:14] <quanticle> I don't think so
[08:53:33] <quanticle> Twitch's model is closer to Patreon than it is to YouTube
[08:59:36] <PapuaHardyNet> so whales?
[09:00:04] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't understand, how do male streamers have whales? I thought only female streamers have whales. Men attracted to men?

[09:02:40] <nshepperd2> yeah that and superchat whaling

[09:23:07] <PapuaHardyNet> also do you have a tree output of the archive that I can view
[09:23:48] <ivan> 1) there are googlers watching 2) PM me in 3 months maybe
[09:24:07] <quanticle> Why do you care if there are Googlers watching lol
[09:24:31] <quanticle> If Google seriously wanted to block youtube-dl they could have done so a long time ago
[09:24:44] <ivan> they do block it with 429 throttling 
[09:25:05] <PapuaHardyNet> .note 3 months PapuaHardyNet request ivan to look at his yt archive
[09:25:15] <PapuaHardyNet> does this even work? I don't know
[09:25:27] <quanticle> 429? I've gotten 403s occasionally, but never 429
[09:25:35] <ivan> you didn't archive enough

[09:26:11] <PapuaHardyNet> I added it to TickTick, so no worries
[09:26:22] <CoJaBo_> Is youtube-dl even still alive? Weird not seeing it update for so many months

[09:26:40] * quanticle uses yt-dlp, yeah
[09:26:52] <CoJaBo_> Does it support downloading tweets yet lol
[09:27:04] <quanticle> Though, if you're just archiving Youtube, and not other sites, youtube-dl still works
[09:27:14] <quanticle> Even though it hasn't been updated since June

[09:29:44] <quanticle> Yeah, hence yt-dlp
[09:30:08] <CoJaBo_> It also can't download things that streamed live but are inexplicably marked as adults-only (a webinar, ffs)
[09:30:18] <quanticle> Though, I don't like the fact that yt-dlp requires you to set a config option to have the same filename format as youtube-dl
[09:30:43] <quanticle> CoJaBo_: Not even if you pass the --cookies option with your browser cookiejar?
[09:30:44] <PapuaHardyNet> huh? just use a custom filename format

[09:31:20] <CoJaBo_> quanticle: I don't have a youtube account
[09:31:50] <quanticle> Then how can you view that stream in a browser?
[09:31:55] <CoJaBo_> quanticle: Is yt-dlp able to download things like tweets, that have text longer than filenames can be? Because that's the most annoying bit of it
[09:32:08] <CoJaBo_> quanticle: I can't view it at all, is the problem
[09:33:07] <quanticle> Oh, I don't see why you're blaming yt-dlp then. If you can't access the stream in a browser, then why do you think yt-dlp is going to let you access it? yt-dlp is for archiving, not bypassing blocks.
[09:33:10] <CoJaBo_> Yet every video I do view in browser is surrounded by illuminati wet-Tshirt twerk vids, and those apparently aren't a problem.
[09:33:47] <CoJaBo_> quanticle: I'm using youtube-dl; I first learned yt-dlp existed approximately 4 minutes ago.
[09:34:02] <quanticle> Well, for YouTube, there's hardly a difference.
[09:35:08] <CoJaBo_> Yeh, it probably won't help me to view webinars of such risque things as antispam tool consoles

[10:26:06] <CoJaBo_> I hate python.
[10:28:35] <quanticle> All of these problems stem from the fact that Python's package management is worse than even Javascript's
[10:28:58] <dv^_^_> i don't know what you guys are talking about
[10:29:04] <dv^_^_> python works great
[10:29:22] <quanticle> The whole reason you end up with so many separate (or rather, semi-separate, semi-conjoined) installations is because Python is incapable of comprehending that *more than one version* of a dependency may exist
[10:30:04] <quanticle> I love how Python folks are proud of virtualenv
[10:30:18] <quanticle> Rather than taking it as a sign that their package management scheme is FUBAR

[10:32:39] <quanticle> Well, I wouldn't go that far. The language itself is quite nice. It's just... all the rest of it
[10:32:56] <synthmeat> performance is terrible, language is meh
[10:32:59] <nshepperd2> that's because in the dark days before virtualenv, the package management scheme was fubar and everything you installed would just be dumped in one global cesspool
[10:33:06] <synthmeat> pkg mgmt is the worst
[10:33:59] <quanticle> nshepperd2: Yeah, and instead of actually fixing that, they give you virtualenv, which is basically a power-shovel that you can use to dig multiple cesspools
[10:34:07] <nshepperd2> lmao
[10:34:34] <quanticle> I mean, fuck, even *Java* got this right

Other programming environments allow you to have multiple versions of a shared library, with different programs linking against the version they specify. Heck, .Net goes one farther and even allows you to redirect those links, specifying, e.g. that an application should use version 4 of
[10:59:49] <quanticle> a library even if it specifies version 3 (because presumably you've tested v4 and have found it to be backwards compatible enough for your purposes). 
[10:59:51] <quanticle> So I guess maybe you mean, instead of having a bunch of different redirects, Python ends up with something like C#'s global assembly cache?
[11:03:22] <saturn2> having multiple versions is also a design flaw
[11:04:13] <quanticle> Oh? How do you handle the reality of non-backwards compatible code changes then?
[11:04:42] <saturn2> breaking library compatibility should be punishable by excommunication
[11:05:32] <quanticle> Mmm... but sometimes the API has to break, in order to fix security issues. We can't write perfect code first time every time.
[11:06:36] <saturn2> that's virtually always a dishonest excuse and not a real reason
[11:07:31] <saturn2> if it's really absolutely necessary the pope can issue a decree to allow it

[12:03:07] <shawwwn> firefox ftw
[12:03:37] <mst> does hitting 'end' not work
[12:04:43] <shawwwn> I almost specified "and no cheat code like hitting 'end'" and then realized no one would be that pedantic
[12:04:51] <shawwwn> congratulations for finding a way to subvert expectations
[12:05:03] <mst> I mean, that's usually how I scroll right on a wide page?
[12:05:22] <shawwwn> noob question: do macbooks have an 'end' key?
[12:05:24] <mst> followed by hitting left for a bit if I didn't want to go all the way right
[12:05:28] <shawwwn> it's one thing I miss from windows days
[12:05:35] <shawwwn> and physical keyboard days, for that matter
[12:05:39] <mst> I suspect they use ctrl-right-arrow or something?
[12:05:44] <mst> or cmd-right-arrow
[12:05:47] <mst> fucked if I know
[12:06:13] <shawwwn> randomly mashing random control cmd right keys ended up just switching tabs
[12:06:20] <shawwwn> fuck apple and their lack of end key
[12:06:24] <shawwwn> end key was the best key
[12:06:31] <shawwwn> now I have a useless dictation key
[12:06:34] <shawwwn> it's f6, and I hate it
[12:06:38] <shawwwn> it just opens dictation
[12:07:02] <shawwwn> https://i.imgur.com/ei5oBg4.png most useless key in the universe
[12:07:18] <shawwwn> second only to the mythical F-lock key that hopefully none of you have a clue what I'm talking about
[12:07:41] <mst> Fn-Esc is FnLk on this keyboard
[12:07:59] <kuudes> you could get a usb keyboard?
[12:08:02] <mst> shawwwn: Fn-Right-Arrow
[12:08:52] <shawwwn> haw, if only it were as useful as FnLk. no no. F lock was some feature that, for a brief time in the 2000's, keyboard manufacturers thought would be a good idea: you press it, and it turns all of your F keys into random media keys, e.g. play / pause buttons, sort of similar to how macbooks are now
[12:09:24] <shawwwn> but became a running joke between me and my friend, because literally the only time we ever pressed it was by accident, since we kept discovering alt-f4 mysteriously stopped working
[12:09:25] <mst> ah, so, modern keyboards, often they act as random media keys unless you hold Fn
[12:09:28] <shawwwn> "goddamn f-lock"
[12:09:35] <mst> and turning Fn-lock -on- is how you get your F keys back
[12:09:39] <shawwwn> yes
[12:09:47] * kuudes scrolled using page down...
[12:09:59] <mst> kuudes: the challenge was 'all the way to the right'
[12:10:04] <mst> kuudes: I don't think page down will achieve that :D
[12:10:23] <kuudes> oh
[12:11:03] <kuudes> but the raw data is not very wide? I think I'm doing this wrong
[12:11:05] <mst> shawwwn: F3/2/1 on this keyboard are vol-up, down, and mute until I turn FnLk on
[12:11:31] <mst> but I don't really use function keys inside X11
[12:11:40] <mst> in fact, I barely ever use function keys except for F4
[12:11:53] <shawwwn> that's almost useful. but only almost. well, now I don't know whether to hit enter after writing this
[12:11:57] <mst> oh, and F5 to turn the advanced graphics off in starcraft
[12:12:20] <shawwwn> actually, you're right, I suppose I hardly ever use F keys either
[12:13:07] <shawwwn> the only time I need them is when playing dota, since I use 123 and F1 for "wasd movement" of my screen (instead of edge scrolling with the mouse)
[12:13:19] <shawwwn> and also in pycharm, because something-F6 is "rename"
[12:13:33] <mst> the rest of the media key bindings are largely pointless to me, but I use volume control a lot more than I need alt-F4
[12:13:37] <shawwwn> but I never end up remembering what "something" is and just click "rename" each time, and say "ah yes, I'll remember next time"
[12:13:46] <mst> hah
[12:13:53] <shawwwn> I just miss keyboard brightness keys
[12:14:00] <shawwwn> apple removed those and put in the dictation key
[12:14:03] <mst> oh, yeah, that's the other ones I use
[12:14:14] <mst> F5/6 on this keyboard are brightness when not FnLk-ed
[12:14:18] <shawwwn> so now I just never turn on my keyboard LEDs anymore. too much hassle.
[12:14:23] <shawwwn> lucky
[12:14:29] <mst> but that's screen brightness not keyboard
[12:14:44] <mst> I'd forgotten backlit keyboards existed

[12:35:06] <nshepperd2> is that the annoying javascript thing that inserts a chat box on the page so you can talk to a product spokesperson

[12:36:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: yes
[12:36:22] <nshepperd2> terrible
[12:37:40] <ivan> everynoise is really cool, thanks
[12:44:03] <Gurkenglas> Okay so even an implementation as a popup window akin to the existing ones would remove a deliberate trivial inconvenience that keeps your inbox deseptembered
[12:49:40] <saturn2> i've considered a simple feedback/help textbox
[12:50:31] <saturn2> as for your list, i don't like third parties or web 2.0
[12:52:28] <saturn2> so far i haven't received any feedback of a quality low enough that it wasn't worth getting
[12:52:59] <saturn2> although i can only handle so much feedback even if it's all high quality
[12:54:26] <Gurkenglas> lacking the time, or the social energy to literally skim the feedback for the most relevant bits? or would you feel bad not giving time to each
[12:54:51] <shawwwn> normally I'd agree with Gurkenglas in this type of situation, because Gurkenglas is recommending a modern solution, which almost universally tends to be a better solution than old style. But... intercom is uniquely annoying, precisely because every site everywhere has it.
[12:54:55] <Gurkenglas> s/most relevant bits/highest-quality items/
[12:55:03] <saturn2> i would feel obligated to read all of it if i put the form there
[12:55:40] <shawwwn> I feel like I can no longer just go to a business and look at their pricing without having that damn intercom bubble either pop up, shake around, or do some other annoying "ohai look at me" attention nonsense
[12:55:48] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, the part of web 2.0 that you don't like being not the feedback/help textbox but the tech bloat?
[12:56:28] <shawwwn> like
[12:56:47] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, would it be fine if it just sat there in the corner? Or perhaps if you had an addon that hid it until you clicked on the addon, perhaps with the addon icon's color indicating whether it's available?
[12:57:16] <saturn2> mainly what i don't like is the pervasive spying, then the manipulative, intrusive and deceptive UIs, then the tech bloat
[12:57:36] <shawwwn> "have you considered using intercom for greaterwrong?" immediately brings to mind "have you considered putting a chat bubble in the lower right corner of every page ever loaded on greaterwrong?" which then translates without loss of generality to "have you considered adding a sticky button that almost no one wants to see just in case someone wants to say something?"
[12:58:17] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, "almost no one wants to see it" <- generalizing from one example, and also applied to many existing buttons
[12:58:23] <Gurkenglas> *applies
[12:58:54] <kuudes> why would anyone want feedback
[12:59:02] <kuudes> users are mostly evil idiots
[12:59:10] <shawwwn> adding a sticky button to the lower right corner of every page on a site which is designed to be a passthrough for another site is probably not a net benefit
[12:59:18] <shawwwn> but that's just, like, my opinion man
[12:59:24] <saturn2> most GW users are people i like
[12:59:30] <saturn2> it's a very niche site
[12:59:45] <kuudes> you could put a chatbot there I suppose?
[12:59:47] <shawwwn> yes
[12:59:50] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, when I give feedback for a bug or missing feature that's often fixed. Seems like a good reason to me!
[12:59:52] <shawwwn> no
[13:00:20] <shawwwn> I mean, *maybe* if the intercom button were solely limited to a page that you had to click on in order to get to
[13:00:28] <shawwwn> like, if someone was hunting around for "how do I report a problem on greaterwrong"
[13:00:33] <shawwwn> and they see "click here to say something"
[13:00:37] <shawwwn> and *then* intercom pops up
[13:00:42] <shawwwn> then sure, cool, good idea
[13:01:14] <shawwwn> having it always on by default though? I mean I'm trying to be diplomatic here. but screw it, quanticle already hates me, so perhaps you should too
[13:01:16] <saturn2> on the other hand, there are already numerous ways to contact me with a tiny amount of effort
[13:01:19] <mst> saturn2: odd thought: register a twitter account and tell people to tweet at it?
[13:01:27] <shawwwn> adding intercom to every page is somewhere between the most terrible idea I've ever heard, and the idea that conceived hitler
[13:01:44] <Gurkenglas> Yeah, on About I saw "send a mail here or ping this guy on #lesswrong", and LW seemed less trivially inconvenient and that's the only thing currently!! that i find better about LW
[13:01:51] <saturn2> mst: i would have to go out and buy a burner phone? meh...
[13:02:26] <mst> saturn2: oh, right, I think I signed up before they required that
[13:02:37] <saturn2> i guess i should add that you can also send me a lesswrong PM
[13:03:14] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, every page has an About link at the top, all it'd need is, like, "long-press the about link to open the feedback chat bubble"
[13:04:47] <Gurkenglas> lesswrong PM is elegant, you can do feedback-chat-bubble-by-long-press-About and user PM popups in one stroke
[13:07:24] <shawwwn> hey saturn2 have you considered adding a sticky link to goatse.cx in the corner? in case your users wanted to goatse?
[13:07:29] <shawwwn> you never know
[13:08:05] <shawwwn> as a bonus, goatse.cx is now blockchain powered
[13:08:15] <shawwwn> so by extension you'd be hopping aboard the blockchain craze
[13:08:40] <shawwwn> now if only goatse.cx had an intercom.. I could finally tell them what I think

[13:09:21] <shawwwn> rip
[13:11:32] <nshepperd2> have you considered releasing a series of 15 greaterwrong.com chat apps, in every case deprecating the previous one before the next one is half-finished
[13:11:51] <saturn2> lol
[13:18:23] <kuudes> could we put there a form which harvests emails we could sell to trolls or something
[13:19:05] <kuudes> does zombo.com still exist? we could put a link button there which says "under construction" to get those old school vibes

[13:23:30] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, that's an ad hominem so you should feel bad :P
[13:23:37] <shawwwn> you were just trying to help. being a dick in response was just me being a dick. you're not wrong that adding an intercom button would also increase the rate at which people leave feedback
[13:24:41] <shawwwn> yes, I feel worse now. the cycle is complete
[13:25:22] <nshepperd2> argumentum ad depressivum
[13:39:58] <Obormot\Gaia> Anyone who is too lazy/dumb to click the "About" link at the top, and follow any of the easy contact instructions... is feedback from them even worth getting?

[14:16:51] <shawwwn> welcome to the conversation
[14:17:23] <shawwwn> we were just discussing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omorashi and how much you really don't want feepbot to autocomplete what it is
[14:17:25] <Gurkenglas> By the way, I hereby declare that when you are deciding whether and what to say to me, treat me as taking no direct emotional damage from when you're a dick at me. Let's see where that goes!

[14:18:17] <nshepperd2> thank you feepbot
[14:18:37] <shawwwn> sadly no wiki command, oh well. that's life.
[14:19:07] <shawwwn> Gurkenglas at this point I assume everyone inevitably will hate me in lesswrong, so
[14:19:16] <shawwwn> honestly that was already my assumption
[14:19:26] <shawwwn> both obormot and quanticle have broken ranks; you're next buddy
[14:19:49] <Gurkenglas> Broken ranks in what way?
[14:20:02] <Gurkenglas> As in, I don't follow.
[14:20:28] <shawwwn> well, even obormot used to like me. we talked about cooking a lot, and he shared his auto sticky killer extension (which I still use)
[14:20:55] <Gurkenglas> And what do people not like about you lately?
[14:20:56] <shawwwn> then one day, "nope, fuck you, ignored"
[14:21:07] <shawwwn> then quanticle was next

[14:21:34] <Gurkenglas> hehehe what did it
[14:21:39] <shawwwn> so me being a dick to you was just further deservation
[14:22:19] <Gurkenglas> i, uh, didn't even notice you being a dick to me, I just saw that "I am strongly against that idea"
[14:22:45] <Gurkenglas> s/saw that/saw that as/
[14:22:50] <shawwwn> in obormot's case, it was something related to my balls, actually. I think I mentioned how good it feels to scratch one's ballsack, and how uniquely human it was, and he was like that's disgusting, I've been looking for a reason to ignore you anyway so that did it.
[14:23:07] <shawwwn> but I probably dressed it up more disgustingly than I'm describing it now
[14:24:22] <shawwwn> in quanticle's case, I was just having a typical me being nutty episode and ended up yelling at him when he was making fun of me for constantly mentioning obormot, and so I ended up /ignoring them both and saying how childish it is to /ignore people
[14:24:36] <capisce^> how does it feel to be hated?
[14:24:39] <shawwwn> "woo look at me I can be a child too, never thought I'd stoop to your level" etc
[14:24:52] <shawwwn> but then I felt bad and unignored him and apologized, but he hasn't spoken to me since

[14:25:17] <shawwwn> nice try
[14:29:59] <Gurkenglas> Hmm. I suppose I might ignore someone if I notice that they take up significant time and grant neither insight nor fuel, and then I point this out and it doesn't help.
[14:33:08] <Gurkenglas> The declaration above was at you as the channel, not just shawwwn.
[14:34:26] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, now that I have allocated some axons to you and you're vulnerable to me, what were your AI timelines and your research activity?
[14:36:32] <Gurkenglas> No need for an essay :P
[14:38:04] <shawwwn> oh, during this period you should expect me to suddenly be sleeping
[14:38:13] <Gurkenglas> what is this period?
[14:38:33] <shawwwn> well, for example, it's 6am and I haven't yet slept, despite attempting to. so expect it to be rand()
[14:38:36] <Gurkenglas> have you considered a wrist device that streams "is this person sleeping" to a webpage
[14:38:45] <shawwwn> does such a thing exist?
[14:38:59] <shawwwn> I'd even have it update my twitter bio
[14:40:09] <kuudes> have it tweet every time you go to sleep or wake up?
[14:40:10] <shawwwn> "currently sleeping" is definitely a thing to have in one's bio
[14:40:15] <shawwwn> nope, just bio
[14:40:42] <Gurkenglas> first thing that comes up is the "oura ring" which uses 300$ and bluetooths your breath and pulse to an app
[14:40:59] <shawwwn> lame. there definitely should be such a thing. but
[14:41:08] <Gurkenglas> which is definitely enough for detecting sleep
[14:41:13] <shawwwn> to answer your question, the fact is, I'm more or less irrelevant in AI now
[14:41:19] <Gurkenglas> how so
[14:41:20] <shawwwn> my glory days are behind me, not ahead of me
[14:41:37] <Gurkenglas> then why dont you switch approaches
[14:41:52] <shawwwn> I just don't think I'll be having impactful output when my focus is my day job.
[14:42:02] <Gurkenglas> then why do you have a day job
[14:42:30] <shawwwn> because my account balance was $0 at the beginning of august, and will be $180k by january
[14:43:02] <Gurkenglas> and what would the long-term future fund need to pay you to put you back in AI?
[14:43:56] <shawwwn> as flattering as that is, I see my impactful role as being an AI cheerleader, rather than an AI practitioner. I help people get into AI, and point out interesting things related to AI
[14:44:32] <Gurkenglas> Impactful enough. Do you disagree with EY about anything?
[14:44:37] <shawwwn> in terms of actually doing AI, though, the fact is, gwern always had the ideas. I never came up with anything innovative. the closest was GPT chess, which gwern claims I thought of, but
[14:44:51] <shawwwn> it was still his idea to do it at all
[14:44:57] <Gurkenglas> What did you supply in that collaboration? The comparative advantage for devops?
[14:45:14] <shawwwn> I hardly know who EY is
[14:45:20] <shawwwn> let alone know enough to disagree
[14:45:27] <Gurkenglas> Have you read Superintelligence?
[14:45:47] <shawwwn> I can't think of the last book I read
[14:46:06] <shawwwn> I spend all my time reading pdfs
[14:46:34] <Gurkenglas> Do you think people should do x-risk work instead of capability work?
[14:46:41] <shawwwn> https://i.imgur.com/rXSH9r9.png
[14:46:52] <shawwwn> this is apparently just page one of three of just how many pdfs I have open
[14:47:09] <shawwwn> I don't know what x-risk is
[14:47:16] <shawwwn> or what capability work is
[14:47:29] <shawwwn> at this point I'm also wondering if this is real life or if I'm dreaming
[14:47:32] <shawwwn> am I asleep?
[14:47:41] <shawwwn> I seem to be awake
[14:47:43] <shawwwn> okay
[14:47:50] <shawwwn> yes, I don't know what x-risk work is
[14:48:08] <Gurkenglas> Hoo boy! Do you expect that when we'll in the coming years/decades properly automate AI research and then the world undergoes a paradigm shift?
[14:48:26] <Gurkenglas> -when
[14:48:32] <shawwwn> all the other pdfs I apparently read https://i.imgur.com/RwlmvQw.png
[14:48:50] <Gurkenglas> How did you test whether you are awake?
[14:49:23] <shawwwn> I was mostly joking because the conversation was unexpected (but not unwelcome). but
[14:49:32] <shawwwn> there is no chance of an AI paradigm shift within our lifetimes
[14:49:41] <shawwwn> everyone will die miserably disappointed
[14:49:46] <Gurkenglas> How do you think you know that?
[14:50:00] <shawwwn> with their hearts broken at the lack of AI apocalypse slash singularity
[14:50:16] <shawwwn> because of the axiom that I've long ago convinced myself of
[14:50:23] <Gurkenglas> That axiom being?
[14:50:45] <shawwwn> to invent AGI, you either need to use evolution, or bypass evolution. there is no other alternative. right now, everyone is convinced that it's possible to bypass evolution
[14:50:53] <shawwwn> ~no one is making evolution simulators
[14:50:57] <shawwwn> that's not a thing that people try to do
[14:51:01] <Gurkenglas> How did you convince yourself of that axiom?
[14:51:18] <shawwwn> by the fact that evolution is *the only process* by which AGI has ever been created
[14:51:26] <shawwwn> and that it's entirely plausible that it's *the only process* that works
[14:51:39] <shawwwn> therefore, since no one is focusing on it, it will not happen within our lifetimes
[14:52:01] <nshepperd> that would be nice if it was true
[14:52:16] <Gurkenglas> It's plausible, I grant. That does not sound like sufficient evidence for "no chance of the opposite"
[14:53:15] <shawwwn> I grant you that, in return. But I would also bet you that $180k I mentioned before. I'm just that pessimistic about the chances. because... if you study the history of science, you'll see just how many times humans let their hubris fool them
[14:53:15] <Gurkenglas> I have recently thought of a mechanism by which people might come to not expect an AI paradigm shift, let's see if it rings true.
[14:53:39] <shawwwn> to me, this sounds equivalent to saying "but it's not impossible that the earth might be the center of the universe"
[14:53:50] <shawwwn> yes, it is indeed not impossible, based on what was known at the time
[14:53:56] <shawwwn> it was just very unlikely
[14:54:11] <shawwwn> the idea that evolution can be bypassed, seems equally unlikely
[14:54:16] <shawwwn> and no one is focusing on evolution.
[14:55:47] <nshepperd> ahh, the wonderful feeling of ghosting Amazon recruiters
[14:57:28] <synthmeat> shawwwn: that was always my intuition as well. but it lacks arguments :(
[14:57:58] <Gurkenglas> If there's an AI paradigm shift, most of the utility lies in the future. Suppose one has a model that strongly says that ~100% of it does, and starts out with a 10% on the possibility. One observes that one's revealed preferences do not match an expected utility calculation, and tweaks the model. the 10% hits 0% before the 100% gets meaningfully away from 100%, and then no further update is necessary. I suggest 
[14:57:59] <Gurkenglas> that one is not to update probabilities from observing revealed preferences! Never! Instead, conclude that you don't care about all future humanity more than about all current humanity, even were it to contain infinite humans. Does that ring true?
[14:59:40] <Gurkenglas> (or perhaps a little more, but not astronomically more. perhaps less.)

[15:22:21] <feepbot> Smartwatches Archives - PINE STORE (PINE64 Open Source Software Smartwatches)
[15:23:07] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, would you prefer to be woken every time you fall asleep without planning to, such as via electric shock?
[15:25:22] <shawwwn> honestly I've wished for an electric shock alarm
[15:25:43] <shawwwn> but that was back during the days where I'd get fired if I wasn't at the office at precisely 9am
[15:26:14] <shawwwn> covid happened, and as horrible as it was -- it killed my uncle -- I have to say, it was something of a godsend for me
[15:26:24] <shawwwn> remote was a quirky thing. no longer. now it's the norm.
[15:26:53] <shawwwn> anyway. I don't fall asleep when I'm not planning to. it's the other way around
[15:26:57] <shawwwn> I can't fall asleep when i want to
[15:27:11] <shawwwn> hence it's 7am and technically I'll need to be working at 11am
[15:27:25] <shawwwn> so today will be the usual .. fun .. of narcolepsy
[15:27:30] <shawwwn> luckily it's no longer terror-inducing
[15:28:03] <shawwwn> since five years ago, in this situation, I'd be sleeping fully dressed for work on the couch, then leap out of bed (aka off the couch) at 8:30am when the alarm goes off
[15:28:22] <shawwwn> and then walk out the door without letting myself sit down, otherwise I'd instantly fall back asleep 
[15:28:51] <Gurkenglas> Have you tried medications?
[15:28:52] <shawwwn> good times. not. ("how to ruin your appetite for ever having any day job ever again, for at least five years")
[15:29:03] <two2thehead> shawwwn, do you have the ability to wake up on time without an alarm clock?
[15:29:06] <shawwwn> sure. I take 2x baclofen each night along with my prozac
[15:29:29] <shawwwn> it does help achieve a restful sleep
[15:29:44] <Gurkenglas> Are you experiencing light before sleep, and if so have you considered a melatonin spray
[15:29:45] <shawwwn> the only other medication, however, is xyrem. affectionately known as the date rape drug
[15:30:03] <shawwwn> since it's what date rapists use to drug their victims
[15:30:09] <two2thehead> I ask because those that do, have a problem with tension and anxiety
[15:30:11] <shawwwn> and I'd rather not date rape myself
[15:30:30] <two2thehead> ie the thing that allows them to wake up on time with no alarm, causes the tension
[15:30:33] <Gurkenglas> Just because of the semantic adjacency? That seems silly!
[15:31:28] <shawwwn> well. it was also because it cost $fuckload, and I had been fired shortly before receiving my first dose. so I never ended up needing to take it, since I no longer had a job at which I needed to be up for.

[20:23:37] <shawwwn> *artificial life* doesn't exist
[20:23:39] <Gurkenglas> therefore it is merely an engineering challenge to figure out how to produce research
[20:23:44] <shawwwn> we don't know how life arose
[20:23:55] <shawwwn> we don't know how to turn collections of dead atoms into life
[20:24:06] <Gurkenglas> i don't need life, i just want papers
[20:24:16] <shawwwn> when you look at a bird, you see that it's flying through the air, and you can very easily make a paper airplane
[20:24:55] <shawwwn> we can't make a "paper airplane" for life
[20:25:07] <Gurkenglas> birds can fly, we can make planes that operate by the same principles of aerodynamics. humans can think, we can make programs that operate by the same principles of information processing
[20:25:30] <shawwwn> one of those is not like the other. the leap isn't justified
[20:25:54] <shawwwn> it's not merely information processing. you're technically correct, the best kind of correct
[20:26:00] <shawwwn> the entire universe is in fact information
[20:26:14] <shawwwn> but that's also my point. people dismiss the universe part
[20:26:18] <shawwwn> and focus on the information part
[20:26:30] <shawwwn> and seem to believe that you can compress the amount of information required
[20:26:52] <shawwwn> (specifically, the amount of information processing required -- i.e. the entire process of evolution)
[20:27:11] <feep> we've already compressed 99% of evolution
[20:27:42] <feep> we just need to figure out the small part where you turn a neural network into an intelligence
[20:28:13] <feep> the mistake is thinking of evolution as goal-directed. humanity is not the result of billions of years of gradient descent into one target.
[20:28:28] <feep> we are an accident of a shifting adaptation landscape.
[20:28:50] <pompolic> i'm not even an AI-dilettante, but my impression is that we don't even truly know the goal
[20:29:07] <pompolic> what is general intelligence, really? are humans general intelligences??
