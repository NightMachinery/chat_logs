[03:45:51] <flatcap> ebb: ah!  thanks for the update
[03:46:56] <flatcap> noex: by default <ctrl-b> is mapped to `urlview` (an external program) that gives you a menu of "clean" urls
[03:48:26] <noex> weird. there doesn't seem to be a urlview in the gentoo repository
[03:48:43] * flatcap checks the name
[03:49:07] <noex> oh, it's called urlscan?
[03:49:23] <noex> no, nothing comes up for that either
[03:49:33] <flatcap> definitely urlview
[03:49:47] <flatcap> mutt and neomutt packages (for other distros) have it as a requirement
[03:50:08] <flatcap> weird
[03:50:23] <flatcap> it's in our default /etc/neomuttrc
[03:51:23] <flatcap> you could work around it by rolling your own macro...
[03:51:33] <flatcap> using `|` <pipe-message>
[03:52:05] <noex> i see it in /etc/neomuttrc as well
[03:52:10] <noex> that's really strange
[03:52:23] <flatcap> |cat
[03:52:57] <flatcap> with `set wait_key = yes` and `set pipe_decode = yes`
[03:53:18] <flatcap> will show your email in the terminal without breaking up the lines

[23:27:06] <laumann> demure: it's an interesting question though - the index will automatically update in a running instance of neomutt, when running mbsync separately. Should the sidebar also update these?
[23:28:38] <flatcap> hmm... it _should_.  alternatively, you could manually <check-stats> (unbound by default)
[23:29:46] <demure> I'll have to remember to test if C-l does the trick. the main thing I'll notice is that over time my other submailboxes will get updated to show unread, but then will still be listing old unread counts later. so maybe the sidebar refresh I am mentally expecting is on a longer timer than my mbsync hook
