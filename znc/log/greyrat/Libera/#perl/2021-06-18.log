[00:02:41] <Grinnz> yeah, that isn't optimized, it just keeps the stack from overflowing
[00:02:52] <Grinnz> which does help in some cases
[00:03:14] <ilmari> yeah, it's actually slower than a regular sub call
[00:04:20] <tm604> heh, "optimised" isn't really top of my list of expectations when dealing with Perl or Python, but I'll take "not running out of memory" as a nice-to-have
[00:04:58] <Grinnz> if you're recursing enough that you run out of memory, performance might be your next problem
[00:05:36] <LeoNerd> "recursion is iteration" is great in a language like Scheme where thunks are /really/ cheap. They are not cheap in Perl

[00:06:56] *** Joins: mesaboogie (mesaboogie@user/mesaboogie)
[00:07:52] <pflanze> Any insight on whether I should call operations to take an element out of a set, map, tree etc. "delete" or "remove"? I know Perl's hash key deletion op is called `delete` of course, but Rust uses "remove" everywhere, and Clojure seems to do the same. (Haskell uses "delete" in Data.Set, though.)
[00:08:00] <pflanze> I tend to prefer "remove", I don't know why.
[00:08:25] <LeoNerd> Offhand I can't imagine any significant distinction between the two words. Personal preference I guess
[00:08:38] <mst> pflanze: are you talking about functional that returns the modified version?
[00:08:53] <pflanze> $foo->remove($val) reads better, anyway; delete $h{$val} may look good since it specifies the whole data point in one go *after* the delete keyword.
[00:08:58] <pflanze> mst, yes
[00:09:02] <LeoNerd> Oh - yeah if it's an "immutable return" thing, call it "without"
[00:09:09] <mst> pflanze: without or except
[00:09:14] <LeoNerd> my $newbag = $bag->without("red");
[00:09:22] <pflanze> Hmm.
[00:09:32] <LeoNerd> delete and remove both suggest inplace mutation

[00:10:24] <mst> pflanze: yes but there's total confusion reading it
[00:10:40] <mst> pflanze: I'd use without by default
[00:10:56] <mst> pflanze: if I really wanted to use e.g. remove I'd do it as $bag->but_remove('red')
[00:11:01] <pflanze> And what would you call the inverse, adding an element?
[00:11:08] <LeoNerd> with
[00:11:47] <pflanze> That feels weird. "do with" or so, could mean anything. Also, "with" in Pascals and what not means "with element $x, do ...".
[00:12:56] <pflanze> What if "remove" is functional and "delete" is mutation?... (I know, I guess you won't think that's right)
[00:13:14] <mst> ->but_add and ->but_remove maybe
[00:13:25] <pflanze> Hmm, maybe.
[00:13:58] <pflanze> That would at least allow more options, like, I've got data structures that allow both "add" (add new element, complain if duplicate) and "set" (replace existing element).

[00:24:13] <gordonfish> I guess it makes more sense to allow `my $obj2 = $obj1->new(...);` when there is supposed to be a relation between them, otherwise it's just sugar.
[00:24:20] <pflanze> Except where every modifying method is a constructor, of course, hehe (functional API).
[00:24:34] <LeoNerd> In that situation a better method name would be `->clone`

[00:32:49] <Grinnz> pflanze: offering a bunch of alternatives seems great, until you want to add features and the things you didn't actually need to offer are squatting on the api you want...
[00:32:54] <Grinnz> tradeoffs
[00:34:13] <Grinnz> yeah, for a constructor which takes the invocant's attributes into account, ->clone is a better name
[00:35:23] <pflanze> Scheme uses the exclamation mark for operations that actually mutate (usually as a performance hack where possible), and I'd love to have something like that.

[00:37:22] <pflanze> I'll have to try it.
[00:37:42] <pflanze> It *may* be obvious anyway it's non-mutating as the code explicitly uses the result, though.

[04:32:48] <Grinnz> funny enough the Freenode adapter for maverick should now probably be a subclass of SocialGamer assuming inspircd uses the same RPL_WHOISIDENTIFIED as unreal... but i'm leaving it as a subclass of Libera so as not to break configs and because supporting connecting to that network seems silly
[04:33:29] <Grinnz> also yes, i should name those adapters after ircds or services packages but shrug
[04:37:49] <Grinnz> i keep thinking that, and then remember why i named them after networks, so they're discoverable because nobody knows what a unrealircd is
[04:38:15] <Grinnz> really, i should have ircd roles and then network subclasses that use them

[05:41:24] <gchristensen> I have a long running daemon that I'd like to scrape prometheus metrics from. it is a fairly simple program: starts up, jumps in to a while loop processing events. usually for prometheus you'd have a background thread serving the /metrics request, is there a good way to do this today? if I'm going to be fighting upstream I can find another way to approach this
[05:41:42] *** Quits: mesaboogie (mesaboogie@user/mesaboogie) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[05:42:25] <Grinnz> the only reasonable way to do "background threads" in perl is via a c library really
[05:42:30] <Grinnz> with pthreads
[05:42:49] <Grinnz> that have no direct access to the perl interpreter
[05:43:47] <Grinnz> but, assuming the CPU part of both what the program does and what is needed to serve metrics are both minimal, you could refactor it to use an event loop instead of a while loop
[05:44:26] <Grinnz> cooperative multitasking just requires nothing blocks for too long
[05:44:29] <gchristensen> the events are brief, so that would probabl ywork
[05:44:47] <gchristensen> though I am not extremely excited to do that :D 
[05:45:03] <Grinnz> have you used IO::Async?
[05:45:39] <Grinnz> that would be my default suggestion, unless you have a specific task that's better served in another ecosystem

[05:46:47] <gchristensen> I'll take a look, thank you!
[05:56:36] <tm604> I'd suggest statsd instead - there are exporters available for prometheus, and it avoids the two problems of "comparatively heavy HTTP request serving for metrics" and "you lose important metrics when you crash"
[05:56:52] <tm604> i.e. push-based, rather than pull-based

[11:30:33] <jaggz> how can I do a simple parse of an optionally quoted set of 1 or 2 arguments?
[11:30:39] <jaggz> ($from,$to) = ($body =~ /^(['"]{0,1})([^\1])(\1)\s+(['"]{0,1})([^\1])(\1)/);

[11:31:37] *** Joins: Judabuda (~ok@user/judabuda)
[11:31:41] <jaggz> other example:  foo 'bar',   foo bar
[11:32:13] <jaggz> basically I need to get two commandline args, which normally go to the units command, but allow them to be quoted like they'd be on commandline, and I'd need to take their innards
[11:33:03] <vague> Do the arguments have spaces in them? Or single words? Just remove the quotes, problem solved
[11:33:17] <jaggz> vague, they could have spaces yes
[11:33:33] <jaggz> (hence the need to allow the quotes, so it can accept the one or two, and recognize the space as the divider)

[11:33:53] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Text::ParseWords - parse text into an array of tokens or array of arrays - metacpan.org ]
[11:33:54] <jaggz> but if they don't have spaces then not quoting is fine
[11:34:17] <jaggz> hmm
[11:34:39] <Grinnz> it's mostly similar rules to shell quoting

[18:12:30] <pflanze> I've got one of those issues that almost make me question my sanity...: https://l.perl.bot/p/pfbtw2
[18:12:31] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Perlbot Pastebin ]
[18:13:14] <pflanze> I can run `empty_mindex( \&string_first)->xadd ("Hi")->add("Hi")` and it returns an error object wrapped in an Err object, as expected.
[18:13:36] <pflanze> Then I run an expression that throws an exception. Fine. Then I run the above again, and now it also throws an exception. Wat.
[18:14:15] <simcop2387> what does xadd actually do?
[18:14:16] *** Joins: Adois (~Adoi@user/adoi)
[18:14:20] <pflanze> It's reproducible in the fperl repl, but not when run in a pod testing.
[18:14:43] <pflanze> So must be the repl's fault somehow, just now I can't imagine how... Will have to dive in or rubber duck until I've got an idea.
[18:15:07] <pflanze> simcop2387, xadd functionally adds the element and if it's already in there, throws an exception. If it's not in there, returns the new version of the mindex.
[18:15:11] *** Quits: mattil (~mattil@helsinki.portalify.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:15:21] <simcop2387> my suspicion would be empty_mindex() is returning the same reference when it should be making new stuff, or xadd is doing so too

[18:48:16] <pflanze> OK, narrowed it down to my $SIG{__DIE__} handler not working correctly.
[18:49:00] <simcop2387> yea sig die can be rather weird sometimes and is generally not what you want to do unless you're directly exiting.  causing spooky action at a distance isn't uncommon
[18:49:37] *** Quits: bastelfreak (~bastelfre@basteles-bastelknecht.bastelfreak.org) (Quit: WeeChat 3.1)
[18:50:04] <pflanze> I'm using it to get a sub-repl at the point of an exception being thrown. Helps debugging. But it *should* not become active when inside an eval {  }. And expecially I'm not aware of any state that is being carried over, that's very weird. Investigating.
[18:50:57] <simcop2387> the only way to stop it from running in eval {} is to remove it during the eval
[18:51:08] <simcop2387> carrying state over though is weird at least
[18:51:20] *** Joins: vrurg (~vrurg@45.74.95.181)
[18:51:32] <pflanze> IIRC I made it look at the stack frames, if it sees eval, then it does not go into the debugger. I wrote that years ago.
[18:51:53] <simcop2387> eval: $SIG{__DIE__} = sub {say "HELLO YAAKOV"}; eval {die "I'm an eval"}

[18:55:13] <perlbot> simcop2387: No output.
[18:55:39] <simcop2387> pflanze: there's a good chance you'll want to guard against that in evals to avoid things like that.  but finding the shared state will also be useful and important
[18:56:00] <pflanze> I confirmed my handler is the issue exactly via that approach.

[20:39:14] <pflanze> I think I did the latter so that one can enable debugging-on-exceptions globally during module load.

[21:28:16] <genio> pflanze: It is bug-ridden on OSes like Windows. It provides a false sense of security as you can't de-taint certain things. That leads to untainting via a .* regex which is pointless and defeats the purpose. It has code for it every damn where. It slows down Perl. And it doesn't make anything more secure.
[21:28:43] <genio> In other words, fuck Taint mode!

[21:36:47] <Grinnz> because ENV is literally necessary for programs to work
[21:37:10] <Altreus> oh someone did mention formats

[21:40:15] <thrig> you may want to clean up ENV but that can be done without taint bogging down all perl
[21:40:53] <pragma-> `use` isn't quite like C's #include, actually. I was looking for something that would directly insert another file without any processing whatsoever. But that's okay, Import::Into seems to solve my problem.

[21:42:01] <pragma-> thanks mst
[21:42:56] <Altreus> isn't that do?
[21:43:02] <pragma-> Also watched 2 different lightning talk videos on Import::Into. Had no idea mst wore a kilt.
[21:43:26] <Altreus> oh yeah, probably with a knife in the pleats
[21:44:14] <pragma-> mst: I like your fast and informative cadence. Good videos.
[21:44:37] <Grinnz> pragma-: probably best to rethink why you think you need that - "run this other code here" was the perl 4 way of doing things, we have namespaces now for a reason
[21:45:37] <Grinnz> if it's just for lexical pragmas then yes, you actually just need proper importing, not code insertion
[21:45:46] <pragma-> Grinnz: I'm doing it so I don't have to write `use strict; use warnings; use feature '...'; etc' at the top of about 20 .pm files in a subdir. Sometimes I add a new feature and I have to edit each .pm file. Now I can just do `use Imports` and stuff everything in Imports.pm.
[21:45:51] <Grinnz> right
[21:46:08] <pragma-> is there a better approach?
[21:46:12] <Grinnz> that can be done with a simple import method, but Import::Into means i don't have to explain how :)
[21:46:25] <pragma-> Yeah, that's why I'm using Import::Info.
[21:46:27] <Altreus> isn't that just use v5.30;
[21:46:30] <pragma-> mst handled all these edge-cases.
[21:46:30] <haarg> pflanze: taint mode doesn't slow down perl when you use it, it slows down all perl programs just by being supported
[21:46:30] <Grinnz> and Import::Base is an Import::Into wrapper specifically for that purpose
[21:46:45] <pragma-> Altreus: well, I'm trying to support back to at least 5.16
[21:46:55] <haarg> you can get a faster perl by recompiling perl with taint support turned off
[21:47:05] <Altreus> oh, well check that none of Modern::Perl or common::sense or any of those things already do it
