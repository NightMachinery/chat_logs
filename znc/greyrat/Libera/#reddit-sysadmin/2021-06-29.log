[01:10:58] <sintax> fft
[01:11:16] <sintax> i'm trying to troubleshoot a printer, not a regular printer, a label printer that stopped supporting windows at xp
[01:11:26] <CptLuxx> perfect
[01:11:30] <CptLuxx> put it in the landfill
[01:11:40] <sintax> I wish. i don't even know what it prints
[01:11:51] <sintax> and the error code they're giving me doesn't match any i can find online so....
[01:11:55] <sintax> throw it away. you don't need it
[01:12:28] <int0x1C8> sounds disappointingly familiar
[01:12:56] <haljhon> Is this something like a Zebra printer?
[01:13:02] <vinrock> is it a fancy label printer or some bullshit
[01:13:06] <sintax> haljhon: yes
[01:13:10] <sintax> OKI printer. 
[01:13:14] <vinrock> fancy like, zebra stuff
[01:13:16] <vinrock> oh yes thats fancy
[01:13:16] <haljhon> Yeah, I used to have to support label/receipt printers.
[01:13:37] <sintax> I've never had to mess with one in my life. 
[01:13:45] <sintax> all i know is they're garbage.
[01:13:57] <haljhon> okay.
[01:14:09] <sintax> oh well. i'll figure it out. 
[01:14:11] <sintax> or break it. 
[01:14:13] <sintax> win win
[01:14:31] <haljhon> are you trying to print something and getting an error or trying to initialize/do control things and getting an error?

[01:15:58] <vinrock> lol
[01:16:26] <haljhon> Almost always, the receipt/label printers are completely different from anything else.
[01:16:43] <haljhon> OKI may not actually even manufacture their own
[01:16:46] <sintax> unless it's like 260+ then it talks about thermal crap and replacing the fuser or checking the cables on the cu/pu
[01:16:58] <sintax> yeah i have no idea. 
[01:17:12] <sintax> i may drive up and look at it as there's no way to login to the damn thing
[01:17:30] <vinrock> ok i makes pretty heavy duty shit i would think they do make these
[01:17:44] <haljhon> OKI printers look like they are rebrands of... something
[01:17:52] <vinrock> ah
[01:18:03] <vinrock> theres a couple small companies that specialize in these industrial type label printers too
[01:18:05] <vinrock> maybe one of them
[01:18:06] *** Joins: riff-IRC (~riff-IRC@user/riff-irc)
[01:18:17] <vinrock> theyre pretty specialized, we use them in our hwarehouses to print packing labels and also the warranty labels on some products
[01:18:24] <haljhon> honestly, there aren't all that many people that make receipt printers
[01:18:35] <sintax> yeah i've used something similiar but no clue who made them and they worked wirelessly. 
[01:18:37] <haljhon> Axiom, Toshiba, NCR, Epson, Star, and Citizen
[01:18:46] <int0x1C8> epson and zebra mostly
[01:18:46] <sintax> but that was when i was in operations. i got to make some one else deal with them not working. 
[01:19:07] <vinrock> i like zebras stuff its pretty nice, just expensive af
[01:19:18] <sintax> for sure
[01:19:21] <haljhon> Motozebra
[01:19:22] <sintax> and it's own zebra language
[01:19:26] <vinrock> yeah motozebra
[01:19:50] <haljhon> Symbomotozebra to be more accurate
[01:20:05] <int0x1C8> our store uses all zebra label printers for item price tags, and a zebra badge printer thing to make gift cards
[01:20:41] <int0x1C8> and guess what poor soul has to support them all

[04:28:06] <xe0n> err it's sql server best practices to configure the correct user accounts
[04:28:10] <xe0n> thats not fancy, that's just standard stuff
[04:28:11] <Work-BWMerlin> Fair enough, as their support documentation recommends having telnet open I think I can let MS's best practice of having different user accounts slide on this one
[04:28:37] <xe0n> its more that he doesn't understand how to do it, not that it's not possible

[04:29:23] <Work-BWMerlin> I added the AD accounts and it said it couldn't find them.  I think there is something I am not understanding about using AD accounts as service accounts in SQL.
[04:29:26] <xe0n> Work-BWMerlin: and with that attitude moving forward, the next guy after you is going to have the same attitude you have towards the dude who just left
[04:29:56] <xe0n> so you weren't able to resolve the user account?
[04:30:44] <Work-BWMerlin> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-windows-service-accounts-and-permissions?view=sql-server-ver15#VA_Desc
[04:32:04] <SleePy> telnet open. My god
[04:32:23] <Work-BWMerlin> That is what I am not understand, this says they are local accounts, and I can see in SQL config that I have two different accounts, NT\MSSQLServer and NT\SQLServeragent
[04:32:57] <xe0n> yup
[04:32:59] <SleePy> The SQL service account should run as a domain user if you need kerberos to work.
[04:33:23] <SleePy> Plus delegation and SPNs setup also then
[04:33:29] <xe0n> ^^

[04:36:30] <xe0n> kerberos just means it authenticates to the domain controller hehe, a standard domain account
[04:36:47] <SleePy> Instead of NTLM..
[04:38:07] <SleePy> We use kerberos delegation on our SQL servers.  Because some stored procedures issue commands to linked servers and we have to pass through creds to make it properly secured
[04:38:25] <SleePy> Pain to remember to configure everything right
[04:38:52] *** Quits: ctrypoph (~ctrypoph@99-51-11-77.lightspeed.brhmmi.sbcglobal.net) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[04:38:58] <Work-BWMerlin> The MS documentation doesn't (unless I missed it) mention anything about using domain accounts, only the local virtual accounts that get setup during installation
[04:39:28] <Work-BWMerlin> This will be a single SQL server running for a POS system.  Very light usage.
[04:41:37] <SleePy> So most likely the pos app can be configured to use a sql only account.  You can configure a user in sql (non domain) and give it the rights it needs.

[09:43:09] <A-KO> DrZak: they literally give you the raw TXT record in the output

[16:20:49] <xe0n> ++++

[16:22:17] <Jay-Win10-Ros> if you're doing 10 boxes, just do some sketchy screenshot doco as you install them so if it's repeated someone has a list, and do it manually and save yourself the time

[16:24:49] <sd> 14<D​ylan> We have 3 different types of hardware and we will get more. First I will have to deploy servers for upcoming projects, then update the in-house server followed by servers outside that will be offline. The idea is to ship the USB stick somewhere and make the installation process as easy as possible.
[16:24:49] <sd> 14<D​ylan> Otherwise we'd have to fly someone
[16:24:52] <Jay-Win10-Ros> it's one guy's folder
[16:26:00] <Jay-Win10-Ros> Dylan - you inject drivers in MDT for each model and it does that part of it
[16:26:49] <Jay-Win10-Ros> for offline servers you've got a different issue, but you could prob deploy MDT to a mini desktop and pass that around
[16:27:35] <Jay-Win10-Ros> or work out a VPN for the servers while they're being deployed...
[16:28:25] <Jay-Win10-Ros> I've got a cradlepoint and I'm guessing I could probably work out how to deploy a server with that and a prodesk mini pretty easy; change the device IP address after it's built
[16:28:33] <sd> 14<D​ylan> I would like that but some clients prohibit network access from outside
[16:28:44] <Jay-Win10-Ros> it's not the client's box till it's deployed as prod
[16:29:11] <Jay-Win10-Ros> just don't hook it up to their kit till it's built
[16:30:38] <xe0n> you could even do it off a thunderbolt disk
[16:30:52] <xe0n> thunderbolt is faster than usb
[16:31:10] <sd> 14<D​ylan> So it's not recommended to save the MDT installer on the USB device?
[16:31:18] <xe0n> yeah probably not, thunderbolt would be faster
[16:31:21] <Jay-Win10-Ros> nah it needs to be a PC :P
[16:31:24] <Jay-Win10-Ros> or a server
[16:31:28] <xe0n> or a nas
[16:31:32] <Jay-Win10-Ros> but MDT doesn't need to be domain joined
[16:31:54] <Jay-Win10-Ros> it's purely DHCP rules.... 60-62?
[16:32:17] <Jay-Win10-Ros> somewhere round there, there's two rules. "All network boot traffic goes to X.X.X.X when booting, pointing to this file"
[16:32:32] <Jay-Win10-Ros> then you just put a file in that location on that IP address, which is every MDT doco
[16:32:55] <Jay-Win10-Ros> so if you've got a network cable plugged into a pc/server booting off DCHP (in this case, a single cable to a pc with mdt running on it)
[16:33:02] <Jay-Win10-Ros> you're cooking with gas
[16:33:24] <Jay-Win10-Ros> then once it's built, you switch it to their network, domain join / network config, good as gold

[17:22:01] <haljhon> But, for someone like me with decent speeds at home and no reason to need Starlink (yet), it is expensive.

[20:49:09] <JollyRgrs> yeah, SCCM is a lot of initial config to get everything going
[20:49:31] <int0x1C8> sounds like MDT
[20:49:36] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> int UW is hiring some cool stuff
[20:49:38] <JollyRgrs> and when you inherit someone else's that did subtle things wrong... you don't know b/c you never thought someone would be stupid enough to not do $thing
[20:49:43] <oxipital> mdt is a subtech of sccm
[20:49:45] <JollyRgrs> nah, MDT is pretty ez
[20:49:52] <JollyRgrs> oxipital: not really
[20:50:07] <oxipital> a lot of what you pay for for sccm is tying a bunch of shit together
[20:50:10] <JollyRgrs> i mean, MDT only covers a small portion of what SCCM Can do
[20:50:13] <JollyRgrs> if that's what you are saying
[20:50:37] <JollyRgrs> oxipital: huh?
[20:50:54] <oxipital> nah, mdt is like an extension of os deployment
[20:50:56] <JollyRgrs> i am not sure you think that word means what you think it means
[20:51:09] <oxipital> which sits underneath sccm
[20:51:35] <JollyRgrs> MDT can be used to make OSD more powerful... and SCCM OSD and MDT can perform the same tasks...
[20:51:51] <oxipital> gotcha.
[20:51:56] <oxipital> TIL
[20:52:09] <JollyRgrs> but I think you are grossly oversimplifying... or just don't have a grasp of everything SCCM is
[20:52:19] <int0x1C8> "like MDT" only insofar as they both need time and effort to configure and set up
[20:52:35] <oxipital> no, i have a pretty decent understanding of what sccm does, i think
[20:53:06] <oxipital> i'm not an expert or anything, but i know it does more than deploy os's or simply deploying applications
[20:53:09] <int0x1C8> but whatever, bring it on
[20:53:24] <JollyRgrs> of all the reporting, monitoring, configuration baselines, etc.
[20:54:14] <oxipital> sure
[20:54:15] <JollyRgrs> it deploys OS, apps, updates, enforces configurations, can monitor app usage, track assets, "and so much more!"
[20:54:41] <JollyRgrs> and not just what it does, but how it does it
[20:54:59] <sd> 14<D​ylan> Is it possible to create a bootable installer on USB with MDT UDI? Seems like that's the tool with custom install pages that Google suggests. Can't find that answer on Google
[20:55:10] <oxipital> sure,  a lot of it relies on configmgr
[20:55:11] <JollyRgrs> you can chain applications (dependencies, or sequences to install mult. apps), you can supercede applications, etc.
[20:55:18] <oxipital> yes, dylan
[20:55:19] <int0x1C8> we use PDQ deploy and inventory here right now
[20:55:34] <oxipital> first link of 'mdt usb deployment' in google is a link.
[20:56:02] <JollyRgrs> yeah, MDT you create the iso, then burn the iso to a usb stick
[20:56:03] <int0x1C8> I've always had the impression that SCCM is like those 2 combined and turned up to 11, with extra stuff sprinkled on top
[20:56:07] <JollyRgrs> donezos
[20:56:15] <oxipital> int0x1C8: me too
[20:56:18] <JollyRgrs> int0x1C8: yes... but "and then some"
[20:56:35] <oxipital> which i think is a potaytos po-tahtos thing with JollyRgrs
[20:56:36] <int0x1C8> right
[20:56:39] <JollyRgrs> most orgs rarely use more than 20-25% of SCCM's potential
[20:56:40] <oxipital> a lot of it is reporting
[20:56:53] <oxipital> but i've never worked anywhere that leaned heavy on reporting
[20:56:53] <JollyRgrs> reporting is a huge part of it
[20:56:56] <JollyRgrs> and most ppl never touch it
[20:57:03] <oxipital> ^\
[20:57:22] <oxipital> i  think that's understandable though
[20:57:33] <sd> 14<D​ylan> Yeah I saw that link but it didn't cover UDI. Not sure if UDI is something separate. `Using MDT UDI as OSD Frontend in Microsoft SCCM`
[20:57:33] <JollyRgrs> reporting isn't just for data scientist type things... if you need to know who has modern auth DISABLED on their devices... you can get that info
[20:57:36] <JollyRgrs> and also correct it
[20:57:41] <oxipital> i mean if updating is hit or miss, then how can you trust reporting
[20:57:54] <oxipital> UDI IS SOMETHING SEPARATE
[20:58:08] <JollyRgrs> oxipital: wdym "updating is hit or miss"?
[20:58:26] <oxipital> we used sccm at a big insurance company i temped fior.
[20:58:29] <int0x1C8> the WSUS kraken
[20:58:31] <JollyRgrs> windows update service being broken doesn't affect data collection and sending to SCCM
[20:58:41] <oxipital> update pushes were broken, reporting wrong
[20:58:41] <sd> 14<D​ylan> So UDI is on top of MDT therefor I can export it to iso?
[20:58:43] <oxipital>  etc
[20:58:44] <JollyRgrs> in fact, you can use reporting to see who hasn't updated their servicing stack, etc.
[20:58:59] <oxipital> a lot of it was due to network issues
[20:59:17] <JollyRgrs> so... if servicing stack isn't updated... it won't notice that they have an update available... so it says "no updates available, i'm compliant"
[20:59:35] * oxipital shrugs
[20:59:36] <JollyRgrs> but if there's networking issues, that's not an SCCM issue anyways
[20:59:58] <oxipital> well i guess i kind of expect more from such a big expensive product.
[21:00:18] <oxipital> pass config status via some normally open protocol
[21:00:27] <oxipital> or do more than lie about update status
[21:00:28] <JollyRgrs> oxipital: lol
[21:00:33] <JollyRgrs> oh son... so much to learn
[21:00:39] <oxipital> what?
[21:00:50] <oxipital> pass that shit via a soap envelope over ssl
[21:01:00] <oxipital> 443 is normally open.
[21:01:09] <JollyRgrs> if you had 50k devices all trying to send their status via packets waiting on the line?
[21:01:25] <JollyRgrs> there's inboxes for SCCM where this data is collected and then processed
[21:01:27] <int0x1C8> fucking soap? srsly?
[21:01:43] <JollyRgrs> you can have SCCM even collect the actual files if you specify in the inventory
[21:01:55] <JollyRgrs> way too much data to try and just send down the line and wait for an ack
[21:02:09] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> how often are they sending status? like every 30 seconds or something?
[21:02:16] <JollyRgrs> this is why i said you most likely don't understand SCCM well enough
[21:02:32] <JollyRgrs> depends, sometimes as often as once an hour, sometimes once a day, or once a week
[21:02:48] <JollyRgrs> but most of all, it depends on what you are collectinge
[21:02:48] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> ok so 50k devices probably isn't that bad
[21:02:54] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> even at once an hour
[21:02:57] <JollyRgrs> you can EASILY collect way too much data
[21:03:14] <oxipital> i figure that's what child installs are for
[21:03:21] <JollyRgrs> ok dude, i hope you get to manage SCCM at that size some day, lol. when you do, make sure to stream it live and lmk
[21:03:22] <oxipital> i forget the sccm specific term for it.

[21:03:46] <JollyRgrs> i'm not asking for congrats

[21:04:27] <int0x1C8> JollyRgrs IS the smarm
[21:04:28] <oxipital> i'm sure it is

[23:51:07] <sd> 08<c​ritamine> Money corrupts all
[23:51:09] <sd> 05<v​yz> my IT professor had very strong words about him, kinda funny during class he'd rant
[23:51:15] <oxipital> does linus even actually do tech or is he like a tweenie youtuber just with cpus?
[23:51:26] <sd> 05<v​yz> doubt he ever was in IT, just super involved
[23:51:29] <vinrock> iirc hes the wave of dudes that started a tech review chanel just so they could get free shit
[23:51:29] <oxipital> look what prank i pulled on this liquid cooler! 
[23:51:33] <vinrock> nah he was never it
[23:51:39] <vinrock> i dont thin kthe guy was even into tech
[23:51:42] <vinrock> he probably auditioned
[23:51:58] <vinrock> there was another name for the channel before he became the face of it
[23:52:03] <vinrock> and there were other presenters/reviewers
[23:52:09] <oxipital> apparently a coworker here recieved free shit because he was some kind of gaming influencer.
[23:52:14] <vinrock> yup
[23:52:24] <sd> 05<v​yz> NCIX tech tips vinrock
[23:52:30] <vinrock> there was a wave of these chanels back in the day because people found out thats how to get fre shit yo ucould never afford
[23:52:33] <vinrock> yeah thats it
[23:52:39] <Jaelae> love my community chats on facebook: "Looking for guidance on who to call or how to handle a situation with a backyard neighbor that takes their dogs poop and throws it in my yard."
[23:52:40] <sd> 05<v​yz> multiple people would explain certain tech things, he was one of them
[23:52:45] <vinrock> yup
[23:52:49] <int0x1C8> he actually worked for NCIX though
[23:53:06] <vinrock> yeah i was sayin, id assumed he just went to a casting cal
[23:53:12] <int0x1C8> as a product owner I think, involved in market strategy and stuff
[23:53:26] <sd> 05<v​yz> he's def somewhere in between tech, marketing and pub. speaking
[23:53:45] <oxipital> went bankrupt apparently
[23:53:50] <vinrock> i distinctly remember seeing early vids and thinking, wtf am i doing watching a hobbyist review shit
[23:53:52] <oxipital> their only cost is staff
[23:54:01] <oxipital> and production
[23:54:07] <sd> 05<v​yz> they used just test a bunch of theories out and review tech, now Linues Media Group spending a shit ton of money on absurd shit
[23:54:21] <vinrock> well yeah its a bigol profitable business now
[23:54:27] <vinrock> dude bought a taycan
[23:54:29] <oxipital> fuck i cant wait until todays youth hit thirty.
[23:54:29] <vinrock> you go girl
[23:54:42] <sd> 05<v​yz> some fucking way this mans created a whole genre or community
[23:54:44] <seednode> Why 30
[23:54:46] <int0x1C8> iirc, according to him, he wanted NCIX to focus more on building out a logistics infrastructure that would put them in the perfect place to be gobbled up and bought out once amazon started expanding into canada
[23:55:04] <vinrock> oh hes canadian?
[23:55:08] <seednode> oh ya you betcha
[23:55:14] <vinrock> ok ill give him an extrapoint
[23:55:19] <vinrock> i asume hes a pro beer drinker like me
[23:55:20] <int0x1C8> yep toronto I believe
[23:55:26] <seednode> toronno
[23:55:38] <seednode> damn southerners
[23:55:41] <vinrock> a beer enthusiast if you will
[23:55:50] <oxipital> so he wanted a youtube channel to become a cloud provider....
[23:56:00] <seednode> I think h means shipping logistics
[23:56:00] <sd> 05<v​yz> def doesn't look his age tho, looks like a teen still even with the beard
[23:56:04] <seednode> So Amazon would acquire that
[23:56:09] <seednode> Not IaaS
[23:56:09] <int0x1C8> NCIX was like the tigerdirect of canada
[23:56:10] <vinrock> he looks mid 30s
[23:56:16] <vinrock> oh no shit
[23:56:19] <vinrock> didnt know that
[23:56:20] <sd> 05<v​yz> maybe it's his voice
[23:56:25] <oxipital> me either
[23:56:29] <vinrock> i loved tiger direct
[23:56:29] <seednode> I'd maybe watch his videos if his voice didn't hurt my ears
[23:56:37] <int0x1C8> a weird mix of frys and tigerdirect/newegg
[23:56:41] <oxipital> i was more newegg
[23:56:49] <vinrock> i stopped shoppping at newegg when they got rid of will-call pickups
[23:57:00] <seednode> The new newegg owners convinced me to never shop there
[23:57:03] <sd> 05<v​yz> never shopped, i like amazon prime 2 day shipping too much
[23:57:05] <seednode> So now I just buy at microcenter or don't buy
[23:57:07] <vinrock> and i stopped shopping tigerdirect when my office was right down the road from newegg
[23:57:08] <seednode> For now
[23:57:17] <oxipital> yeahi love amazob
[23:57:18] <vinrock> wish i had a close microcenter
[23:57:19] <sd> 05<v​yz> Closest microcenter is in NYC, 3+ hours away
[23:57:21] <seednode> Once Microcenter collapses I'll stop using computers entirely
[23:57:25] <vinrock> the one here in a bit of a drive and its in shitsville
[23:57:25] <seednode> My office is 3 minutes from our Microcenter
[23:57:27] <seednode> So I'm there a lot
[23:57:31] <sd> 05<v​yz> lucky bastard
[23:57:32] <vinrock> only been there once but holy crap what a store
[23:57:47] <vinrock> xyz where you at
[23:57:47] <sd> 05<v​yz> it's best buy, but with good products only
[23:57:48] <seednode> I've not purchased from Amazon for two years now
[23:57:50] <vinrock> there's one in paterson nj
[23:57:52] <seednode> But if Microcenter dies might have to again
[23:57:55] <vinrock> er
[23:57:56] <vinrock> vyz
[23:57:57] <sd> 05<v​yz> connecticut vinrock
[23:57:58] <oxipital> not missing much. microcenter is mostly tvs and miniapple stores
[23:57:59] <vinrock> oh
[23:58:02] <vinrock> damn that blows
[23:58:05] <oxipital> and cell phone cases
[23:58:15] <vinrock> the microcenter here was like
[23:58:19] <vinrock> 50% computer comonents n shit
[23:58:26] <vinrock> i was in nerd heaven
[23:58:26] <int0x1C8> they had the storage/shipping logi but again according to him the company or whatever only saw that as the backbone support to their brick and mortar stores
[23:58:39] <sd> 05<v​yz> i wonder where the turning point was for Linus
[23:58:40] <seednode> My only issue with Microcenter is the employees all insist they know more about what I want than I do
[23:58:47] <seednode> But I think that might be all tech-focused stores
[23:58:51] <int0x1C8> so they got double wammied like circuit city and tigerdirect put together
[23:59:04] <sd> 14<(​dm only if prod isn’t working)c> Debating to stay bold or not, a couple of girls came up to ME and asked ME for MY number
[23:59:10] <nullrend> microcenter in my town is pretty well stocked. About 50% components, 20% apple, 10% hobbyist materials, 20% knick-knacks
[23:59:10] <vinrock> circuit city was put out of business
[23:59:24] <vinrock> iirc they were restructuring or something, needed a bigass loan by X deadline
[23:59:27] <sd> 05<v​yz> that's ballsy of them @(dm only if prod isn’t working)c
[23:59:30] <sd> 14<(​dm only if prod isn’t working)c> Like after my friend told me I no joke look like a nazi all the sudden I’m getting girls
[23:59:34] <vinrock> N bank said theyd lend them then they renegged and circuit city went out of business
[23:59:45] <int0x1C8> microcenter was their direct competitor I think
