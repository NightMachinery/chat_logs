When I try to install docker (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) the VM stops and shows a "full disk" or similar when I try to start it again. If I try to remove the VM it also fails. Can you help?

I have a VM that does nothing more than uses yt-dlp to download videos from channels that I subscribe to, and stick them on an NFS share which is on the Synology. I'd like to move the entire process to the Synology, but I'm having issues getting it to work.

[02:57:59] <tabakhase> Aavar the real is "just dont..." - kvm it, or whack it on the host ((also check docker-machine i guess, that has provisioners for libvirt, virtualbox and more too))
[03:01:00] <tabakhase> SuperLag in dockerland the hub becomes our apt-get - so for a start, you wouldnt go from alpine but python, they did most of the hard work already -  on "whats actually breaking", those VOLUME lines likely break what you expect them todo ;-) you dont "need" them at all anyhow, (you can define named volumes wherever you like when running) and if they are in a dockerfile often "last" ((still, 
[03:01:01] <tabakhase> downloads MAY be one, but /app certainly not ever
[03:01:58] <tabakhase> (the "hub becomes apt" may go as far as finding a decent yt-dlp image out there you can just use)
[03:03:55] <Aavar> tabakhase: Hmm... I didn't understand what you just wrote... Care to elaborate?
[03:04:28] <tabakhase> Aavar any specific part? :D
[03:04:34] <SuperLag> tabakhase: I wasn't sure if $IMAGE would last or be around tomorrow (so to speak), so I figured building from a more basic instance might be the safest way to go. That was my rationale there. There are a couple yt-dlp images available in the hub.
[03:05:22] <SuperLag> tabakhase: also, not sure I can get aria2 from python, either, which helps with fragments
[03:07:36] <tabakhase> Aavar "making dockerd spin inside lxc" is a dirty hack - and the way to make it work disables a lot to "almost all" of the isollation the container gave you in the first place (hence the "then just do it on the host directly...") - its about the same security envelope :P -- and for anything else, use an actual VM from the hypervisor of choice
[03:07:45] <programmerq> Aavar: there's no reason you can't run docker in an lxc container. last time I tried it, I had a few extra steps to make that lxc container be more privileged, but it totally works. without showing the error message you're getting, there's very little to go on.
[03:09:52] <Aavar> programmerq: this is not the exact same error, but similar. https://pastebin.com/QrZA1Tee
[03:10:34] <Aavar> I know this is a lxc error... but is there any other way to resole this than to reboot the host?
[03:11:00] <tabakhase> SuperLag there is certainly some "hygiene" todo when picking such a deeper image sure (yt that is, python are library/official images and will remain "forever") - but even if its bad, having a poke at there dockerfiles maybe even forking is usually worth a look too :P
[03:12:11] <tabakhase> SuperLag and idk about aria2 - but "python" is also just a debian(or an alpine) with more stuff ontop https://github.com/docker-library/python/blob/475515049d39e26da9a169da9b098e6c578e8f51/3.11-rc/alpine3.15/Dockerfile

[03:17:57] <SuperLag> tabakhase: so what I was trying to do was use some config files for yt-dlp to point to, that have all the options I'd normally pass on the command line. I figured the way to do it was mount the folder containing those files to /app, and mount the location of the NFS share to /downloads

[03:19:58] <tabakhase> sidenote on above -> you can (and should) use "apk" inside that python image just fine - with SOME exceptions, good example are the php-images where php is installed from sources, so running a "apt-get install php-mysql" will go havok and install a whole additional PHP inside that container ;D - but the readme is usually vocal about such things, and they provide tooling such as a "docker-php
[03:19:59] <tabakhase> -ext-install" script or the "docker-php-extension-installer" helper
[03:22:19] <tabakhase> SuperLag not inherrently "wrong" no, just need to be stacked up a little different you could say :P - and then walk problem-by-problem 
[03:23:20] <tabakhase> SuperLag and errormessages are prime :P -- if i had to guess, the ADD likely explodes hm? :D  (or you are packing a massive build-context...)
[03:24:45] <SuperLag> hm?
[03:25:02] <tabakhase> (context = the "." in your docker build command = current directory (or some other path, or even STDIN or a zipfile) - and only to that path your COPY/ADD has access
[03:26:07] <tabakhase> and if you plan on bindmounting those things into the container (note, not "image") later anyhow, you dont even want/need to copy that stuff in anyhow

[18:37:01] <davix> tabakhase, I was looking to skip the cp- this may require me to ship additional resources with the image (install wrapper to complete these steps rather then just docker up -v...), i will see what else i can learn about  entry point option. 
[18:37:17] <ananke> I already provided them with a basic docker-compose skeleton, so they don't have to rely on documenting some arcane execution, but it would be nice to have a structured and easy way to do testing
[18:38:21] <davix> ada_, if my mount is already existing the existing host mount should replace the docker one (such as in regular -v mount) if its not existing - create it and copy the files from docker volume to it
[18:39:42] <ananke>  I know they can do 'docker inspect --format "{{json .State.Health }}" <container> | jq', though that may not be obvious enough
[18:39:49] <tabakhase> davix guess you can also say that bindmounts are generally more about "shipping things IN" rather than out (as in, mount that sourcecode from your disk) - anything else volumes are pretty much the deal ((when ignoring the performance implications for a moment))  -- that said, "files from the image in either" have a smell... - cause not only could you lose the file (as you had seen just now)

[19:44:21] <faLUKE> hello. I configured a raspberry PI to work as an access point and it worked (I used this guide:  https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#setting-up-a-routed-wireless-access-point) . After installing docker on it, I can connect to its access point, but can't access Internet anymore. I suspect there's a problem in POSTROUTING. What could I do?

[20:08:49] <programmerq> redo whatever the iptables rules that were in place for the access point routing.
[20:09:11] <tabakhase> iptables-persistent is dangersauce...
[20:09:14] *** Joins: qwd (~qwd@185.203.114.234)
[20:13:46] <faLUKE> programmerq: it's not easy to redo
[20:14:50] <programmerq> guess it's too hard then?
[20:15:16] <programmerq> docker uses iptables for its networking. it has a docker-user chain where you can put stuff that docker would otherwise interfere with
[20:15:43] <programmerq> you'll want to configure whatever rules you need to go to that instead of the default ones that docker drops in.
[20:16:04] <programmerq> that's the basic high level approach for the basic high level description of your issue so far.
[20:18:31] <faLUKE> programmerq: the only iptable rule that I set is "sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE"
[20:20:08] <faLUKE> then, how/where do I have to configure that rule while docker is installed/running?
[20:22:34] <faLUKE> maybe this: "Docker also sets the policy for the FORWARD chain to DROP. If your Docker host also acts as a router, this will result in that router not forwarding any traffic anymore. If you want your system to continue functioning as a router, you can add explicit ACCEPT rules to the DOCKER-USER chain to allow it:"
