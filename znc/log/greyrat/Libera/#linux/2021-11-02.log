[00:00:04] <hexnewbie> I was able to reboot my previous router like that, open a Qt 5 app over X forwarding, and a minute, the router reboots itself. 4-5 months later it died completely, and would boot only 1 in 10 times after such reboot. In short: I place my bet on hardware damage

[00:02:31] <katp32> the issue is that this is a desktop with intel 9260 wireless-ac and a threadripper, not a router :P
[00:02:39] <katp32> problem occurs on every linux distro I've tried
[00:02:43] <hexnewbie> That can be a software problem, if conntrack gets full, or fills the RAM (wrong values for conntrack_max and the hash table can do some horrible things, the OOM is more dramatic then a userspace one). But reboot after a continued use of bandwidth sounds closer to a hardware one.

[00:10:27] <hexnewbie> The firmware revision has some chance of being the culprit (I wouldn't rate it high, but it might be easier to test swapping the firmware than the wifi module itself)

[02:03:32] <lovetruth> phogg, aliases can be easier to insert very fast into a .bashrc   and then just with "exec bash" everyone on the OS (suppose you have many people ssh into it) will happily use them :)
[02:03:42] <phogg> I made the math alias because sometimes bash is my calculator and I'd rather say 'math (2*3)+5' without having to add quotes or run bc first.
[02:04:02] <phogg> lovetruth: same is true for functions
[02:04:23] <phogg> admittedly aliases are slightly less typing in the simple case, and way more typing in the complex case

[02:04:59] <lovetruth> yap. I usually like functions more anyway - especially from the programming background :)
[02:05:11] <phogg> if all you're doing is adding some switches, as with the classic alias ll='ls -l' case, then aliases aren't doing you any harm. As soon as you add subshells, pipelines, redirects, or variables you should have used a function

[03:28:38] <Codaraxis> A user was unable to SSH into a server. Regardless of which other server on our network he tried to SSH in from, he would get "Write failed: Broken pipe" as an error. His connection was also rejected when he tried to connect via PuTTy. Looking at the server in question, an SSH process would be temporarily created and was visible in the process list owned by him. There were no /var/log/messages of note that I could spot. Since he didn't need any, I
[03:28:38] <Codaraxis> eventually went through and killed all his processes on the server. The only one that required -9 was metacity. At this point, he could SSH back in without any problems

[03:38:46] <Codaraxis> @jcbjoe2021, That suggests hardware to me. Assuming it's a fresh install, 20 minutes to desktop an additional 10 to the first application loading is unusually slow. You could try an intentionally light distro like LXLE and see how long that takes.
[03:39:11] <Codaraxis> The fact that it shows the Samsung logo for as long as it does leads credence that the BIOS is taking a while to initialize everything before grabbing the OS from storage and handing off to it. It lends credence to slow hardware

[05:17:41] <overlock> katp32, i agree

[05:17:53] <babyface> https://i.redd.it/2ckagwlgsxw71.jpg
[05:17:59] <Psi-Jack> Yonle: Well my go-to for servers WAS CentOS, but that line has been destroyed, thanks IBM. So, These days I recommend Debian, Ubuntu, and MAAAAYYYBE AlmaLinux or RockyLinux, but it's less on my stick these days.
[05:18:03] <naptastic> I'm really happy with Debian on my servers.
[05:18:21] <Yonle> Debian is good, tho
[05:18:21] <overlock> gentoo is nice i remember doing a network bridge
[05:18:25] <mikk0> debian ist gut
[05:18:38] <Yonle> Just the facking ubuntu want to turn every package using snap
[05:18:41] <Psi-Jack> ananke: I literally managed ~30 Gentoo servers, all with profiles so old at the time that it tool recompiling EVERYTHING into binary packages, insuring core stuff was static compiled to prevent breakage.
[05:18:42] <katp32> Yonle: never used debian on a server but I did run ubuntu previously and it ended up just being a nightmare because all the horribly outdated packages meant that I often needed to add 3rd party repos or compile from source manually, which is just hell
[05:18:42] <overlock> arch compiling stuff like on redhat
[05:18:51] <Psi-Jack> Yonle: Yes. Debian IS good. Gentoo is not.
[05:19:13] <Yonle> Gentoo is for regular use, not for server
[05:19:24] <overlock> well gentoo is hard to remember i used forks for years and probably was a waste of time

[05:20:20] <Yonle> ananke, Okay, how about LFS?
[05:20:23] <Psi-Jack> I wouldn't say Gentoo NOR Arch are "good" for even "regular PCs".
[05:20:30] <Psi-Jack> or even "regular people"
[05:20:39] <Psi-Jack> LFS is not a distribution. It's literally a book.
[05:20:45] <ananke> Yonle: LFS is so far out on the spectrum scale, it doesn't even enter the picture here
[05:20:46] <overlock> Arch can be satisfaction
[05:20:50] <katp32> yeah, gentoo is rewarding but requires active maintenance or it will give you hell. not good if you need to manage a ton of machines in parallel, but as long as you have the time to maintain it on each machine you use, I think it's acceptable for anything that can physically run it

[05:22:40] <overlock> i modified a lot of symbolic links idk i was doing therapy
[05:22:40] <Yonle> Alright. Guys
[05:22:58] <Yonle> What do you think about "Things to do after installing ##### linux" ?
[05:23:02] <Psi-Jack> It was funny though, YEARS ago I ran Arch as a very specifically designed proxy-arp based HA firewall for my home router, isntead of using a reliable router that I have today. Arch actually specifically had more issues with just basic networking, it was unreal. Packet loss was way higher than ever. And there was no reason for it. Ripped it off, put on Debian, no issue.
[05:23:04] <Yonle> For me, I just ignore it
[05:23:25] <rascul> /ignore *
[05:23:35] <overlock> well
[05:23:41] * keir muffled screams
[05:23:52] <Yonle> Psi-Jack, Debian is way too stable
[05:23:52] <Psi-Jack> So, I wouldn't even "recommend" Arch for anyone, period. After having used it a couple times as desktop and server, for ANY reasonable use.
[05:24:03] <overlock> that guides post-instalation arent a bad idea for beginners
[05:24:16] <katp32> rascul: my client ignores all users by default, rather than manually ignoring the people I don't want to hear, I just manually unignore the people I do want to hear
[05:24:39] <keir> katp32: you've said that before and i'm still convinced that's not true
[05:24:45] <katp32> it definitely is
[05:25:00] <rascul> by the way, linspire is the only distro worth using
[05:25:03] <rascul> on desktop or server
[05:25:05] <keir> but how can you know you want to hear someone if you never see their messages in the first place
[05:25:12] <katp32> hannah montanna linux is the only distro worth using

[05:25:24] <katp32> keir: psychic projection, like I said before
[05:25:26] <Psi-Jack> I don't use arch btw.
[05:25:34] <rascul> rebecca black os is way better than hannah montanna linux
[05:25:34] <Yonle> I also don't use arch btw.
[05:25:45] <keir> katp32: is this a long-term con you're playing on me?
[05:26:57] <rascul> cons use arch
[05:27:01] <katp32> the only linux distro worth using is a single linux 3.0 kernel compiled for PPC by some dude named john gonzales with no userspace attached
[05:27:03] <Yonle> Hm.

[12:09:06] <TheGuestMovie> bookworm: how c an they work around the fact that proper push notifications on Android require the google cloud push server? Literally the only way around it would be to wake up periodically to check with a pure socket/HTTP request, which will use more battery, and idk if Google even allows this

[12:10:09] <TheGuestMovie> from what I understand, apps just register in the cloud, then the Android OS/push client (not your app) periodically checks "which of these subscriptions have notification" , then Android tells your app you got a notification
[12:10:25] <TheGuestMovie> this is to avoid having every background app be polling a server and consuming battery

What key combo did I accidentially press? And how do I get my shell back to normal state? The only remedy I know is to exit my shell and start a new one.  I am not sure if this is actually something that happens in the shell or if it
[13:51:41] <otisolsen70> happens in Konsole. But I suspect it is the shell. If I call /usr/bin/reset, it gets back to normal behavior.

[16:21:14] <rascul> thyriaen i believe you would need to find the .desktop file and change it there but i don't recall for sure
[16:21:31] <pabed> ananke: you mean this way ? "curl -x socks5://1.2.3.4:443 -L https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -"
[16:21:36] <Psi-Jack> Possibly, yes. You could of course, copy that and override it, or just use menulibre for all that.
[16:22:09] <Psi-Jack> I think the icons, however, would be more a part of icon themes, specifically.
[16:22:10] <thyriaen> rascul, changing the desktop file only changed the - not sure how to call it - icon of the program in the start menu and such

[19:40:59] <hexnewbie> Anyway, the annoying thing is systemd rate limits them (on their request), and then does not cancel the rate limit automatically on explicit ‘systemctl start ceph-osd@1172’
[19:41:24] <Psi-Jack> See thats' where I disagree. It's ALWAYS been needed, and that's why many service managers have been implementing it in the ages.

[19:42:03] <hexnewbie> So after you've been in a completely hurry to fix whatever is preventing the OSDs from dying because the whole data centre is down, now you have to crawl slowly through systemd documentation to figure out how to let it *allow you* to start your OSDs

I have this vps I have forgot the ssh password and I wouldn't want to reset it, because there is some webserver that has no backups and is in use. Now I was about to run the "hydra" to start bruteforcing the psasword, but I started to think that is it possible that this vps may boot or encounter some problems because it is "under attack"? I don't want that because if it gets

[19:57:35] <kveroneau> peetaur, I haven't honestly tried swapping out systemd with sysvinit on my modern Debian, the wiki does mention issues with GNOME, because it's GNOME and it has to depend on systemd...  I may actually give this sysvinit a shot in a local VM at some point.  I am quite curious on how well it's supported in say a non desktop environment.  I personally don't mind systemd, as units are eaiser to manage than LSB init scripts of the past for services.

[22:56:47] <jungleman> the question is what is sr0 really?

[23:20:14] <Psi-Jack> You need a path. . is not in the path (nor should it ever be)
[23:20:26] <XJ8> Yeah, ./ means to do something in the current directory rather than search path for it.
[23:20:27] <Dagmar> koollman: I believe I already teased today that I have written one in bash
[23:20:36] <Dagmar> I have also written one in perl.
[23:20:48] <Dagmar> Between the two, the perl one I'd actually trust.
[23:21:04] <cottnn> besides, some people just like to overengineer and think that some binary in `screen` is too simple and "unscalable", and they need a kubernetes cluster and an AWS instance and all that fun stuff
[23:21:10] <cottnn> because it's "scalable"
[23:21:40] <Dagmar> Psi-Jack: '.' in a user's path is somewhat debateable
[23:21:40] <xiaomiao> cottnn: scaling is easy, but on AWS it'll bleed your credit card dry
[23:22:33] <Psi-Jack> Not really. I mean, you could debate it, but you'd always be wrong about it. 😛
[23:22:34] <Dagmar> Psi-Jack: I generally try and wean those people off it by suggesting ~/bin or ~/.bin if they're a whiner

[23:23:09] <Dagmar> Psi-Jack: So long as it's at the _end_ of the path it doesn't really represent increased risk
[23:23:27] <Jong> I keep going in circles regarding cuda drives. I keep getting E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt --fix-broken install' with no packages (or specify a solution).
[23:23:43] <cottnn> xiaomiao: i bet that some people actually have no clue that you can rent a vps for $10 a month or something
[23:23:49] <hexnewbie> You'd be surprised at the ways operators find to run the malware in someone's user directory they are investigating as root.
[23:23:54] <cottnn> and install anything on it
[23:24:03] <Psi-Jack> hexnewbie: exactly.
[23:24:16] <Psi-Jack> Dagmar: Yeah, there's always an increased risk to adding . to PATH.
[23:24:16] <Dagmar> cottnn: They also don't generally realize that for the price of three months of that you can buy a very small server which will perform more reliably
[23:24:17] <cottnn> so they end up in "choosing the best cloud provider for my wordpress site" thing
[23:24:56] <Dagmar> In practice, users for whom '.' actually represents increased risk are users who will run "email-my-passwords-to-china.sh" without a second thought
[23:25:07] <Dagmar> Usually by finding the file in their file manager and triple-clicking on it
[23:25:21] <cottnn> Dagmar: well for $30 maybe a raspberry pi

[23:26:06] <Dagmar> I upset a looot of people by showing how to actually benchmark a VPS in the first part of the Minecraft boom
[23:26:06] <cottnn> i'm not sure how well rpi would handle apache though or nginx
[23:26:25] <Dagmar> A lot of cats were advertising their VPS services, but overprovisioning at like 60:1
[23:26:39] <cottnn> ohh yea
[23:26:49] <cottnn> there's this whole overselling thing
[23:26:55] <zero> xiaomiao: yes that was it thanks
[23:27:02] <cottnn> there are some good no-bs providers though
[23:27:50] <cottnn> it's also weird how some providers still have no option to upload ISO or have bandwith limits
