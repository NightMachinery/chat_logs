[00:03:21] <Robomot> I'd Rather Have a Cat than a Harem! Novel 1 - Review - Anime News Network (Who needs romance when mom and dad will finally let you get the cat of your dreams?)
[00:03:59] <capisce> why not both?
[00:04:10] <gwern> capisce: from the sound of it, it will be. but cat first
[00:04:26] <gwern> gurkenglas: 1:30? some sort of central bank operation, with too little ammo to permanently move the market?
[00:05:25] <kuudes> gurkenglas, someone with priority gets central bank support to decide the rate as something weird
[00:05:49] <kuudes> basicly, market is not efficient there
[00:06:00] <kuudes> because it is not free etc
[00:07:06] <gurkenglas> aren't they automatically matched with the sell orders that give them the best rate? because this sounds like everyone would put sell orders at maybe 0.009 and cut off the spike.
[00:08:54] <gurkenglas> and then if it was a limited ammo thing the spike ought to get shorter every day
[00:09:27] <kuudes> I don't think putting sell orders is currently freely available within russia maybe
[00:09:43] <kuudes> you know, remember stock exchange is still closed
[00:09:55] <gurkenglas> so every day some random schmuck who says "SELL" first gets a big check? O_o
[00:10:06] <gurkenglas> or, like, someone who bribed someone
[00:10:11] <kuudes> latter
[00:10:24] <kuudes> maybe it is putin buying ammo or something
[00:11:23] <gurkenglas> then you'd think he'd not do it so regularly that curve starts responding to him, which does look like it starts happening over the last few days, right?
[00:11:52] <kuudes> if I knew...
[00:12:17] <gurkenglas> maybe it's just, two people are paid to go to the exchange daily and swap 0.0104 rubles for a dollar and go back home
[00:12:56] <gurkenglas> so someone doesn't fail their order to keep the price above 0.0104 as measured by a gamable metric
[00:13:03] <gurkenglas> *above 0.01

[00:33:08] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Book 1 is Grimes’s Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, with a hint of Lemonade, and it was partly inspired by a theory of Musk’s: that she’s a simulation. “We keep having this conversation where E’s like, ‘Are you real? Or are we living in my memory, and you’re like a synthesized companion that was created to be my companion here?’ ” If this sounds
[00:33:08] <feepbot> like he’s asking her if she’s a virtual pleasure bot, that’s not (entirely) what he means. Anyway, she says, she’s never felt entirely real herself: “The degree to which I feel engineered to have been this, like, perfect companion is crazy.” Does she mean the perfect companion for him specifically? “Yes. Even just studying astrophysics and neuroscience. And it’s
[00:33:08] <feepbot> really annoying because people think I’m an airhead who went to art school.” (She actually wanted to, but it was too expensive.)'

Don’t rely on other people to teach you anything.” She says he taught her how to shoot guns when she was six. Grimes’s parents divorced when she was around 11, and her mother married a man with two sons, bringing her brother count to four. Her grandpa nursed
[00:41:03] <feepbot> her competitive fire. You gonna let your brothers defeat you? Being outnumbered by the boys has never phased her since. She says he taught her to drive a standard transmission by instructing her to reverse the car to the edge of a cliff. If she lets the car roll backward, she says, recalling it now, “we’re literally going to die.”...Grimes’s grandfather is still alive and
[00:41:03] <feepbot> still lives like a hermit in remote British Columbia. Once he gave her some professional feedback: You really need to sex it up. You should be more like Miley Cyrus. “He was like, ‘Your career is going to be way better if you start showing more skin,’ ” she recalls. “I was like, ‘Grandpa.’ ”'

[00:45:40] <gwern> you would need to be fast enough to the brakes, of course, which is a big part of driving: learning brakes
[00:45:46] <ggreer> depends on your reaction to stalling the car. also depends on how you started. did you pull the parking brake, then ease off it as the clutch catches? did you do a 3 pedal start? did you just try to "catch" the car with the clutch?

[01:02:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Interesting re: showing Ruby gwern.net ... I didn't realize most of the LW2 devs had moved to other work (what even is "Lightcone work"? what are they doing?)
[01:03:03] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: Lightcone's specialty right now seems to be basically running conferences
[01:03:40] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I've also just now been walking Oliver through the whole popups system after suggesting they could do transclusion to solve our issues with the versions of "It Looks" getting out of sync and crossposting just being a pain
[01:04:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Interesting
[01:05:59] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I have a bit of difficulty explaining to him the underlying mechanism of when it's an iframe vs when it's downloading html to parse and attach to the DOM or... however it works
[01:06:58] <gwern> (he is impressed but sadly greatly underestimated how much work goes into generating annotations *to* popup)
[01:08:11] <kiboneu> i underestimate things too often. problems i tackles are like hydra-yak hybrids (like the gene splicing in cronenberg's the fly)
[01:08:23] <kiboneu> you shave one yak and the shavings turn into two yaks
[01:08:50] <kiboneu> nowadays i expect to underestimate
[01:10:14] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : 'To play the Riddler Paul Dano didn't have sex for 2 weeks'
[01:10:28] <two2thehead> By that line of reasoning *I* could have played the Riddler :V
[01:12:16] <gwern> ...the riddler? not the joker?
[01:13:04] <two2thehead> 'When the Riddler, a sadistic serial killer, begins murdering key political figures in Gotham, Batman is forced to investigate...'
[01:13:08] <two2thehead> Yeah the Riddler
[01:14:30] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : Hypothesis. Marvel/Ironman/Thor films will *always* be the fun light-hearted films everyone sees every year, while DC films will be the 'serious' psychological films that impacts cinema
[01:15:41] <kiboneu> i think they will cycle 
[01:15:52] <kiboneu> to keep it fresh / exciting
[01:16:17] <kiboneu> something potent about seeing the clown go through dark times (and vice versa)
[01:19:13] <two2thehead> possible
[01:19:37] <two2thehead> apparently the riddler is quite well acted. This bodes well for other Batman villains
[01:19:53] <two2thehead> they won't have to rely on the joker for their star appeal
[01:21:44] <kiboneu> they basically need to get a joker vs. riddler, and then joker figures he needs batman's help and batman also needs joker's help
[01:22:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Did you know that Lumifer is a woman
[01:22:19] <kiboneu> and then they try to betray each other in the end, only to find out that it's been staged by the riddler this entire time
[01:22:34] * gwern rolls the mtf 1d5 dice
[01:22:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: cis woman
[01:22:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wait no
[01:22:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> I misread this
[01:22:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> nm
[01:23:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> (different person)
[01:23:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway
[01:23:12] <gwern> I figured something like that
[01:23:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: "underestimating the difficulty" is the usual thing, isn't it
[01:23:57] <gwern> (I would be really surprised if lumifer were a cis natal woman free of any bizarre issues. lumifer is just so very lumifer, if you know what I mean)
[01:24:44] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah. I think he assumed there was some simple trick. like he asked if we just pulled Pubmed abstracts from PMC clientside
[01:24:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oliver passed me a potential client recently who was like "I want a gwern.net kind of thing" (in more words) and of course I talked to him and he didn't even have a clear grasp of what is CSS and what is HTML, etc.
[01:25:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> I explained to him that I can totally do this but if he thinks that it's a turnkey thing that can be made for him, well...
[01:25:30] <gwern> "oh, there must be some trick, some clever shortcut, or something like the WP api which provides nice clean abstracts for everything - maybe they pull it from Semantic Scholar or Crossref or smth"
[01:25:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haha
[01:25:52] <gwern> "they don't just do it the hard way"
[01:26:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, that's the bottom line, isn't it? Like Eliezer's classic response to "how did you win AI box"
[01:26:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> "There was no trick. I just did it the hard way"
[01:26:41] <gwern> yep. there's no one trick you can patch and say, "ok, ai boxing is safe now"
[01:27:16] <gwern> "phew, good thing we solved that whole ai risk thing in time. now we can go back to the important problems, like putting pronouns in all our bios"
[01:27:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> a.k.a. "no silver bullet; just a whole lot of lead bullets"
[01:27:41] <gwern> at least with lead bullets you have machine guns :(
[01:28:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Lead bullets but they're actually fired from bespoke cannons that you have to get barrels cast for
[01:28:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> For each bullet^W annotation type
[01:29:55] <gwern> maybe those magekiller bullets from _fate/zero_ which are filled with your own groundup skeleton bones and you get like 50 max before the manufacturing process kills you
[01:30:09] <gwern> 'cast from lifeforce'
[01:30:32] <kiboneu> that seems accurate

[03:18:33] <Robomot> Nate Soares (@So8res): "The world is not made of arguments. Think not "which of whese arguments, for these two opposing sides, is more compelling? And how reliable is compellingness?" Think instead of the objects the arguments discuss, and let the arguments guide your thoughts about them."
[03:18:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1500863926858395649
[03:18:38] <Robomot> Eliezer Yudkowsky (@ESYudkowsky): "Your strength as a rationalist is the degree to which it takes "very strong and persuasive argumentation" to convince you of false things, and "weak, unpersuasive-sounding argumentation" to convince you of true things; ideally, in the latter case, the empty string should suffice."
[03:18:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Threads, in both cases, click for full)
[03:20:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> So the Soares thread, mostly agree, but disagree with: "If an argument misleads you, think not "I have learned that similarly compelling arguments are often wrong." Think instead of which step within it was wrong, and adjust your thoughts so that they are not so easily guided down wrong paths." ... but no, you have indeed learned that similarly compelling arguments are often wrong. You can think of steps and so on also, but
[03:20:10] <Obormot\Arcturus>  the thing about arguments is in fact also a thing you have learned
[03:21:09] <feep_> I think it's the least useful thing you can learn
[03:21:21] <feep_> cause you're taking as little correction as possible
[03:21:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Disagree
[03:21:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is very useful
[03:22:07] <gwern> (one man's prior is another man's posterior, I guess)
[03:22:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, the Eliezer thread... is true in a sense, but also: if you attempt to be guided by that principle, then you will go astray
[03:23:18] <gwern> (yes, your prior for true things should be very high and for false things very low, and so it takes no evidence to convince you of true things and tons and tons of evidence - somehow! - for false things, but where do we get this prior? it must be the posterior from a lot of previous updates)
[03:23:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> As I think we have discussed here before, there is a view among many rationalists that the rules of epistemic rationality are things that you can discard as unnecessary once you're sufficiently rational and don't need them
[03:24:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e., "you don't need the rules if you're rational enough"
[03:24:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or "the rules are needed only if you're not rational enough"
[03:24:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> But in fact the rules *are how you become AND STAY rational*!
[03:29:58] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Alexander Graham Bell himself regarded the realities of the telephone business with ever-increasing distaste, and felt himself ever more estranged from the enterprise that bore his name. And to a large extent, the feeling was mutual: he had disappointed and angered his ostensible partners in Bell Telephone by, as they saw it, deserting them in their time of greatest need.
[03:29:58] <feepbot> He had been entirely absent from the American scene from August of 1877 until September of 1878, when he grudgingly agreed to return from Britain to act as a witness in court. “Business is hateful to me at all times,” he wrote to Gardiner Hubbard on one occasion. “I am sick of the telephone and [wish to] have done with it altogether, excepting as a plaything to amuse my
[03:29:58] <feepbot> leisure moments,” he wrote on another. “Why should it matter to the world who invented the telephone, so long as the world gets the benefit of it?” he wrote on yet a third occasion. “I have not kept up with the literature of telephonic research,” he remarked dismissively when he did finally turn up in person for the legal proceedings. These were not the messages which the
[03:30:03] <feepbot> men behind a company girding for the battle for its life — a company with the petulant messenger’s name on the marque — wished to hear. Alexander Graham and Mabel Bell gradually cashed out of said company between 1879 and 1883.

[03:44:27] <quanticle> I wholeheartedly sympathize with Mr. Bell

[03:45:36] <saturn2> do people really think of gwern as an "angelic innocent"?
[03:45:48] <adiabatic> if you don't know any better, sure

[03:47:51] <gwern> (I'm just saying, the pony form isn't *that* different from a bent over human form and realdoll can probably do it at a <100% premium!)
[03:52:54] <mjr> I'm not sure they can pay Hasbro enough.
[03:54:15] <gwern> pfft, the AI part will be a download. and they can sell the cutiemark sticker separately. past that, how can hasbro sue over it? it's just a purple pony. does hasbro really want the media attention?
[03:54:27] <gwern> it's worth noting that hasbro still hasn't sued 15.ai
[03:54:41] <gwern> and 15.ai is 100% explicit about it being twi and is super double dog daring them to sue him
[03:54:54] <gwern> and it's used for all sorts of sex/porn-related audio
[03:55:27] <Obormot\Gaia> Yeah I think Hasbro wants to avoid that sort of memetic association more than they want to avoid trademark weakening
[03:56:06] <Obormot\Gaia> If MLP gets associated in people's minds with middle-aged weirdoes' sex fantasies, it's over as a brand
[03:56:07] <gwern> 'Hasbro Sues MLP Sex Robot Maker' is the sort of headline that instantly costs you far more than you'll ever get back
[03:56:15] <Obormot\Gaia> Yep
[03:56:42] <gwern> it's worth noting how little hasbro has used legal threats and lawsuits so far
[03:58:55] <Obormot\Gaia> Meanwhile, I'm continuing to make my way through Appendix N. Currently up: Abraham Merritt's ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Merritt ) novel _Creep, Shadow!_
[03:58:56] <Robomot> A. Merritt - Wikipedia (Abraham Grace Merritt (January 20, 1884 – August 21, 1943) – known by his byline, A. Merritt – was an American Sunday magazine editor and a writer of fantastic fiction.[1])
[04:01:08] <Obormot\Gaia> 1934. A "weird tale" in the Lovecraft/Chambers/etc. mold. (Though actually he was one of Lovecraft's inspirations, it seems; _Creep, Shadow!_ was his last novel; Merritt began writing in the late 1910s or so) Main character *clearly* based on the author.
[04:01:14] <Betawolf> "He was described as a hypochondriac who talked endlessly about his medical symptoms, and showed eccentric behavior like a need to try out any food, tobacco and medicine he found on his coworkers desks. Occasionally he would dress in a kilt and play serenades for his coworkers with some of his huge collection of instruments he kept in a locked closet at work. He was well liked for his fairness and 
[04:01:20] <Betawolf> inability to fire any employees" he was _that_ coworker
[04:01:47] <Obormot\Gaia> Yes, also:
[04:01:49] <Obormot\Gaia> "His fiction, eight complete novels and a number of short stories,[4] was only a sideline to his journalism career. One of the best-paid journalists of his era, Merritt made $25,000 per year by 1919, and at the end of his life was earning $100,000 yearly—exceptional sums for the period. His financial success allowed him to pursue world travel—he invested in real estate in Jamaica and Ecuador—and exotic hobbies, like
[04:01:49] <Obormot\Gaia>  cultivating orchids and plants linked to witchcraft and magic (monkshood, wolfbane, blue datura, peyote, and cannabis).[5]"
[04:02:28] <Obormot\Gaia> (Certainly no surprise, reading this book, that Merritt was into that kind of substance)
[04:02:33] <quanticle> $25,000 in 1919 is $409,994.22
[04:02:49] <gwern> Betawolf: man, we've all been there. "this is an *Irish* bagpipe" "john we have an on-site with our remotes today" "have you ever heard a little song called... _Molly Malone_" "yes, john. we all have." "but never in THE ORIGINAL IRISH BAGPIPE" [MUSIC BEGINS]
[04:02:58] <quanticle> $100,000 is $1.6 million
[04:03:32] <Obormot\Gaia> Anyway, one of the antagonists in the story, a Dr. de Keradel, expounds, at one point, his theory of ancestral memory, and:
[04:03:38] <quanticle> Yes, I'm sure if I was making a million dollars a year, I'd be doing all sorts of weird shit too
[04:04:08] <Betawolf> I guess the closet had to be locked after some ungrateful soul engaged in sabotage.
[04:04:19] <Obormot\Gaia> “The ancestral memories, the ancient disks, are stored in another part of the brain, away from those that carry the memories of this life. Obviously this must be so, else there would be confusion, and the human animal would be hampered by intrusion of memories having no relation to his present environment. In the ancient days, when life was simpler and the environment not so complex, the two sets of memories were closer.
[04:04:19] <Obormot\Gaia>  That is why we say that ancient man relied more upon his ‘intuitions’ and less upon reason. That is why primitive men today do the same. But as time went on, and life grew more complex, those who depended less upon the ancestral memories than those which dealt with the problems of their own time—those were the ones with the better chance to survive. Once the cleavage had begun, it must perforce have continued rapidly—
[04:04:19] <Obormot\Gaia> like all such evolutionary processes.”
[04:04:24] <gwern> those reeds spontaneously disappeared!
[04:04:28] <Obormot\Gaia> I read that and immediately thought:
[04:04:32] <Obormot\Gaia> THE BICAMERAL MIND
[04:04:41] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I think it's the 'akashic memory' stuff
[04:05:02] <gwern> (the 'region of the brain' is just an attempt to naturalize it)
[04:05:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> mmm not quite, I think, though no doubt related
[04:05:30] <gwern> (sort of like herbert and 'Ancestral Memory encoded in the dna'. yeah whatever dude, we know where you're getting it from, you're mainlining that western-fantasybuddhist occultism)
[04:05:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Merritt's writings were heavily influenced by H. Rider Haggard,[7] Robert W. Chambers,[8] Helena Blavatsky[9] and Gertrude Barrows Bennett (writing as Francis Stevens),[10] with Merritt having "emulated Bennett's earlier style and themes."[10] Merritt's stories typically revolve around conventional pulp magazine themes: lost civilizations, hideous monsters, etc. His heroes are gallant Irishmen or Scandinavians, his villains
[04:05:42] <Obormot\Arcturus>  treacherous Germans or Russians and his heroines often virginal, mysterious and scantily clad."
[04:06:11] <Betawolf> the three virtues of a heroine
[04:06:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Though in this story the protagonist and the antagonists are both... Bretons.)
[04:06:14] <quanticle> Wait, is *that* where Herbert got the ancestral memory thing?
[04:06:18] <gwern> yep, balavatsky, told you
[04:06:31] <gwern> quanticle: well, probably. I don't think I've located a smoking gun for it yet
[04:07:00] <quanticle> Fair enough, but this is similar enough that it's hard to imagine Herbert coincidentally coming up with the same thing.
[04:07:04] <gwern> one of these days I'll spend some quality time in the herbert archives and see what I can dig out...
[04:07:19] <gwern> quanticle: yeah, but there's so many versions of this floating around that maybe it was jung instead or something
[04:07:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also
[04:07:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> The action takes place in New York
[04:07:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because of course it does
[04:07:53] <quanticle> Of course, it wouldn't be noir pulp otherwise.
[04:08:25] <quanticle> Can you imagine any kind of noir storyline taking place in Los Angeles? The very thought itself is ridiculous!
[04:08:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's a part where the protagonist goes up to the villain's townhouse in uptown
[04:08:43] * gwern is unsure if quanticle is being sarcastic here or what
[04:08:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is at the top of a building, overlooking Central Park and so on
[04:09:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> And there's an explicit parallel to, like, an ancient king, looking out over the lands of his subjugated peoples
[04:09:34] <gwern> ooh I always enjoy that in like Alan Moore
[04:09:36] <quanticle> gwern: Half and half. Was there a lot of noir stories that took place in the Los Angeles area?
[04:09:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then they take a trip to uh I think Long Island or maybe Massachusetts or something where said villains bought a bunch of lands and are summoning an elder god
[04:09:39] <gwern> the 'secret architecture'
[04:10:07] <Betawolf> well you can't summon an elder god _in_ the city
[04:10:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's all very "the upper crust are secretly EVIL"
[04:10:18] <gwern> quanticle: well, yeah. like chinatown, big sleep, double indemnity, sunset boulevard, touch of evil...
[04:10:34] <gwern> and modern revivals like l.a. confidential
[04:10:48] <quanticle> Huh
[04:10:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> "[Merritt] lived in the Hollis Park Gardens neighborhood of Queens, New York City, where he accumulated collections of weapons, carvings, and primitive masks from his travels, as well as a library of occult literature that reportedly exceeded 5000 volumes." ... as one does
[04:11:07] <gwern> I find it much easier to think of noir films set in or around LA than NYC, actually
[04:11:19] <gwern> even excluding things like blade runner
[04:11:25] <quanticle> This guy sounds a lot like the heroes he wrote about
[04:11:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes! That's what I'm saying
[04:11:38] <quanticle> Yeah, I'm excluding Blade Runner and cyberpunk
[04:11:49] <quanticle> Both of which are very California focused and very noir
[04:11:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> The protagonist of _Creep, Shadow!_ is just obviously an author analogue
[04:11:58] * gwern looks at https://www2.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-new-york-noirs . he's seen none of these

[04:12:21] <quanticle> So the rule is, author self-insert stories are actually cool as long as the author is actually cool?
[04:12:22] <Betawolf> I guess when you're rich enough, the line between 'fantasies to write about' and 'fantasies to live out' gets rather blurred
[04:12:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Clearly
[04:13:46] <gwern> the musk and branson novels would be lit
[04:14:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh ALSO
[04:14:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> In this novel
[04:15:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> The protagonists need some muscle to help take out the villainous elder-god-summoning reincarnated (??) ancient king or w/e
[04:15:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> So they recruit some
[04:15:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> actual mafiosi
[04:15:24] <Betawolf> great B-movie material
[04:15:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Only not by that name because the word "mafia" hadn't entered common parlance back then yet)
[04:15:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah it's like
[04:16:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Oh yes, my friend, who is a psychiatrist, once helped an Italian mob lord to take revenge on an evil witch who had murdered one of his lieutenants with magic"
[04:16:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> "So now he's gonna call in that favor"
[04:17:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> The mob lord in question is in Italy at the time, so they make do with one of his top fixers, but they telegram the boss himself, who gets on a boat to come to NYC posthaste
[04:17:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's treated like a "cavalry will get here soon" kind of thing

[04:17:50] <gwern> no, just excerpts
[04:17:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, yeah these guys are trafficking with dark powers from realms beyond our own, and wielding ancient magics
[04:18:08] <quanticle> But we have the mafia
[04:18:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> But the big bad Italian mobster boss dude is coming soon
[04:18:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> And when he gets here, oh boy
[04:18:22] <gwern> (_Lit_ would be a great musk novel/autobio title, actually. put it up there with _Liftoff_ or _Ignite!_)
[04:18:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> You sorcerer fuckers better watch the fuck out
[04:18:41] <quanticle> Look, your demons may have demon powers from the underworld, but we have Tommy guns
[04:18:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Exactly that, yes

[05:54:11] <kiboneu> yeah
[05:54:15] <kiboneu> just like tempeh
[05:54:30] <gwern> yes, but I did it for a while and concluded that regular greek yogurt is *so* cheap and making it was kinda annoying in terms of getting everything heated and then straining it

[06:00:36] <kiboneu> are there silicone 3d printers
[06:00:50] <ggreer> most nozzles won't get above 250C
[06:00:51] <kiboneu> probably would have to be way hot
[06:00:53] <kiboneu> yeah
[06:00:57] <rmmh> you 3d print the mold and then cast the silicone
[06:01:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Silicone? Hmm :\
[06:01:08] <ggreer> but you can print molds and use those to cast metals
[06:01:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well
[06:01:23] <rmmh> ggreer: lost wax with plastic lol
[06:01:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> That requires having metal casting equipment, which is additional...

[06:01:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> D:
[06:01:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway I don't think the thing I have in mind is really suitable for casting, shape-wise

[06:04:04] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I know you can send plans to specialist companies which will print it and mail it to you. so if you find one with a metal printer, it might work
[06:04:29] <rmmh> Yeah, they do sintered metal
[06:04:47] <rmmh> it's not as strong as solid casting but it looks good
[06:04:49] <ggreer> the end result there is ugly but printers were much worse in 2013
[06:05:29] <gwern> rmmh: right. I figure whatever obormot is planning doesn't rquire strength, just 'not melt in the oven when I cook with it, and also don't poison me'
[06:07:29] <saturn2> it seems like it ought to be possible to make a 3d printer that uses electrolysis to directly make metal objects, but i've never heard of anyone trying it
[06:07:47] <ggreer> you probably want to 3d print the thing in plastic, then send the file to a company that will print the metal version
[06:08:24] <gwern> saturn2: hm. how would you specify the location? put the electrode really close to the desired point? seems like precision might be bad, and that's not something 3d printers have an abundance of to sacifice
[06:08:44] <saturn2> yeah, you'd have a little electrified needle inside a tank
[06:09:04] <rmmh> saturn2: so, a welder? :) 
[06:09:40] <saturn2> welding isn't the same
[06:09:52] <rmmh> or do you mean electroplating? 
[06:10:22] <saturn2> same process as electroplating, but done bit by bit to get 3d printing
[06:11:15] <rmmh> it's kind of done for integrated circuits 
[06:11:30] <rmmh> but takes lots of horrible chemical washes and coatings and precision
[06:11:57] <rmmh> your cpu has a rats nest of 3d printed wires a dozen layers thick

[07:36:10] <kiboneu> can they afford more inflation? thought there was an overworking / living-in-parents-house thing going on there
[07:36:25] <gwern> quanticle: oh, you mean ukraine. I bet that's way too recent to show up in these stats
[07:37:06] <gwern> kiboneu: economists generally argue that japanese inflation is so low that it suppresses growth
[07:37:54] <kiboneu> ah, i see
[07:38:33] <gwern> no (real) wage growth, minimal (real) GDP growth but zero inflation. reduced demand leading to underproduction and investment. something along those lines
[07:38:43] <kiboneu> right right
[07:39:14] <gwern> and they've had near-zero inflation for like 30 years now
[07:39:34] <gwern> just seems to be a cultural thing. a society-wide horror of inflation
[07:39:41] <gwern> germany seems to be similar

[07:45:53] <saturn2> what if we could have recessions *all* the time? :o
[07:46:48] <quanticle> gwern: Germany is at least understandable. Even we here in the US know about the horrors of Weimar hyperinflation
[07:46:56] <quanticle> But why does Japan hate inflation so much?
[07:47:17] <gwern> WWII destroyed their currency too
[07:47:28] <gwern> you know, '1 yen' used to be serious money
[07:47:52] <quanticle> I mean, 1 cent used to be serious money too
[07:48:02] <quanticle> Used to be able to buy a candy bar for a penny
[07:48:18] <gwern> sure. a lot of years around 5% and then some years at 10%+ will do that to you
[07:48:41] <quanticle> Right, but the US isn't as terrified of inflation as Japan is. 
[07:48:51] <quanticle> Isn't the inflation rate up to about 7% already?
[07:49:01] <gwern> (23% in 1920? wouldn't've guessed that was the record)
[07:49:33] <quanticle> Surprising!
[07:49:43] <quanticle> The US was still on the gold standard then too
[07:50:06] <gwern> yes. of course, during WWI, 'gold standard' was more of an aspiration than a real thing. and then the post-WWI gold standard was even more chaotic and aspirational
[07:50:32] <gwern> give you an idea of just how wild global finances were in WWI and then unwinding it all
[07:50:51] <quanticle> Yeah, those were the years where the US switched from being a debtor nation to a creditor nation, and ended up with some absurd fraction of the world's gold supply, right?
[07:51:16] <gwern> yep. it had diverted huge resources into england and france, who in turn tried to pass the debt onto germany as reparations
[07:51:48] <gwern> you can undertand why inflation would pick up markedly as after the repression of war, people try to spend their savings on finally *living*. after all, that's what everyone has been doing the past year
[07:51:53] <quanticle> It's a useful counterpoint to the goldbugs
[07:51:54] <gwern> still, 23%
[07:52:33] <quanticle> Like, when you try to actually enforce a gold standard (instead of honoring it in the breach, as most countries normally did), this is what happens.

[08:35:59] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: he has a WP article if you want background https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pearce_(transhumanist)
[08:36:00] <Robomot> David Pearce (transhumanist) - Wikipedia (David Pearce (born April 1959)[2] is a British transhumanist. He is a prominent figure within the transhumanism movement and is one of the co-founders of the World Transhumanist Association, currently rebranded and incorporated as Humanity+.[3][4] He approaches ethical issues from a lexical negative utilitarian perspective.[5])
[08:36:09] <PapuaHardyNet> no I haven't looked (or noticed any links) that gwern posted in relation to pearce. I'll check. But hey, that conversation with you is very... insightful
[08:36:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> ardent[m]: Of course it's wireheading
[08:36:26] <ardent[m]> ok fine it's not totally fulldive let's say... or if it is, it's purely wired into the sensory parts
[08:36:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Well, scroll up to how this convo started
[08:36:38] <ardent[m]> (if the difference matters, that's valid)
[08:36:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> ardent[m]: Yes it's wireheading
[08:36:46] <quanticle> ardent[m]: Yeah, of course that's wireheading
[08:37:38] <quanticle> Wirheading doesn't necessarily mean literal wires going into your head. If the system is feeding you inputs via your senses, it can wirehead you
[08:39:57] <quanticle> But I would like to follow up on PapuaHardyNet's question: I get that Davide Pierce is crazy, but why do we care? Is that Humanity+ organization of his important or significant?
[08:40:26] <gwern> quanticle: I think it's more that it reminds you there are people who would unbox Clippy because they see Clippy as *good*
[08:40:42] <gwern> "
[08:40:55] <gwern> It looks like you're trying to end all sentient existence! Would you like help with that?"
[08:41:12] * synthmeat read that as "clippy as *god*"
[08:41:51] <gwern> quanticle: I hadn't even thought about negative utilitarians being part of Clippy's hard takeoff, but Pearce reminds me that that too is totally a story I could've written
[08:41:52] <quanticle> I see
[08:42:29] <quanticle> synthmeat: If I'm reading this correctly, "clippy as good" and "clippy as god" both apply
[08:42:34] <gwern> so it's like "funny comment" "thoughtful criticism" "bonechilling reminder"

[08:50:42] <PapuaHardyNet> but at that point, don't you think we might find better primitive operations than, say, gradient descent? (I don't think backprop is replaceable as long as we use differentiable functions, and neural networks doesn't yet seem to have viable alternatives)
[08:51:18] <PapuaHardyNet> great, you did refer to continual learning. I should first read the entire thing
[08:51:45] <gwern> (the continual-learning is the meta-learned forward rule which approximates backprop but within-episode)
[08:53:57] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: 2cm potatoes much better this time, although I'd need to dial in the heat levels more better. however, the entire house smells like aerosolized ghee with garlic powder and paprika in it, so I'm probably just gonna bake the fuckers from now on and put sour cream in 'em
[08:54:14] <adiabatic> …roughly seven hours after cooking
[08:55:43] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: backprop is in general replaceable. there's lots of things which can approximate gradients without backprop. 'forward gradients' was the other week's thing, but there are a whole zoo of attempts at 'biologically plausible backprop' or using Hebbian learning rules

[09:23:20] <PapuaHardyNet> also sidenote: I don't consider hyperfocusing / using stimulants to get things done to be wireheading. Wireheading usually implies you are optimizing your brain for its reward function, and stimulants basically make you hyperfocus, and that is orthogonal to your brain's reward function

[10:19:06] <saturn2> the different authors represent different points of view or something
[10:19:50] <saturn2> also i think he was spending a lot of time talking to someone with multiple personality disorder or something at that time
[10:20:00] <saturn2> might have been related idk
[10:23:22] <quanticle> I think it's because, at the time, he was genuinely concerned that the postrats he was offending might be able to come after him

[10:29:47] <Ralith> oh well
[10:30:59] <saturn2> he stopped writing and IRC at pretty much the same time, so not exactly graduating

[10:34:43] <quanticle> Though, there is one thing there that I disagree with. He writes that ADHD is a disease of willpower, not attention, and links to this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCAGc-rkIfo

[10:35:11] <PapuaHardyNet> Russell Barkeley is *very* popular in the reddit ADHD spaces
[10:35:13] <quanticle> I watched that entire YouTube video and my takeaway from it was that the professor was claiming that ADHD is a disease of *memory*
[10:35:39] <quanticle> He's saying that ADHD kids literally *forget* what they're supposed to be doing and then latch on to the nearest stimulus
[10:35:46] <quanticle> Is that willpower?
[10:35:57] <quanticle> Or rather, is that a disease of willpower?
[10:36:04] <quanticle> It's not self-evident

[12:04:17] <capisce> although I probably wouldn't find working on a hopeless task that much fun
[12:07:29] <Ralith> the trick is to play with the definition of "working on"
[12:08:00] <Ralith> trick the crypto weenies into funding yak shaving that can later be put to an actually worthwhile purpose
[12:09:21] <Ralith> it's feasible to do this with traditional megacorporations; doing it with crypto startups is probably a comparative walk in the park, though otoh you have to be willing to work at a crypto startup
[12:14:31] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, you mean doing exactly what tech startups do with VCs, except on a smaller scale
[12:19:11] <PapuaHardyNet> so there are two elements that increase the difficulty of finding the optimal "algorithm" for solving a game: hidden information and randomness
[12:19:36] <PapuaHardyNet> roguelikes have a gigantic quantity of both elements
[12:19:37] *** Quits: MerchantOfVenice (~patrick@user/merchantofvenice) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[12:20:52] <PapuaHardyNet> Some roguelikes have a huge amount of hidden information (see Nethack for example), and that incentivizes players to read the wiki to better their strategy
[12:21:37] <PapuaHardyNet> This made some people, including me, believe that roguelikes that eschew hidden information (such as DCSS) are *better* than hidden information roguelikes like NetHack becuase they are somehow "fair".
[12:22:48] <PapuaHardyNet> not true, because DCSS mainly relies on randomness. Now, you can either model the randomness, or you cannot. If you can, this degenrates into a simple computable algorithm. You can read the source code and figure it out. If you cannot model the randomness (aka true randomness), then there's no point in trying since it is true noise.
[12:23:29] <saturn2> hidden information usually means hidden randomness rather than information you can look up on a wiki
[12:24:22] <PapuaHardyNet> sure! do you consider that randomness as something you cannot look up though? I mean, you *can* look at drop rates of weapons in source code, for example, and people do that
[12:25:10] <saturn2> yes, randomness is something you cannot look up
[12:26:10] <PapuaHardyNet> If you sample a normal distribution with a specific mean and variance, the mean and variance can be looked up
[12:28:18] <saturn2> yes, the specific outcome you will get is still unpredictable though
[12:29:56] <saturn2> in roguelikes you need to play through part of the game without knowing what random items you will encounter in the future, that's hidden information
[12:30:09] <PapuaHardyNet> yep! it all devolves into a multi-armed bandit problem, and everything that isn't the actual RNG sampling is basically just hidden information that you can read in wiki or source code
[12:31:05] <capisce> challenge through obscurity vs challenge through randomness
[12:31:47] <PapuaHardyNet> that's a very succinct description what I had in mind, yeah
[12:32:38] <saturn2> "In game theory, a sequential game has perfect information if each player, when making any decision, is perfectly informed of all the events that have previously occurred, including the "initialization event" of the game (e.g. the starting hands of each player in a card game)."
[12:33:06] <PapuaHardyNet> (although if you think of any other distinct element other than hidden information and randomness that massively increases the complexity of finding an optimal solution to games such as roguelikes, do tell me)
[12:33:54] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, I'm not debating your definition of hidden information, I'm using the term a little more loosely. My aim is to mainly categorize the different sources of increasing complexity of finding optimal solutions
[12:34:18] <saturn2> ok
[12:34:32] <capisce> then there's chess, go etc, challenge through combinatorial complexity
[12:36:17] <PapuaHardyNet> uh-huh. their current best solutions are probabilistic only because these RL agents aren't huge enough to contain all the combinations
[12:37:05] <PapuaHardyNet> if all randomness in the world is pseudorandom, then with a gigantic enough supercomputer you can create an agent that can optimally act given any situation
[12:37:11] <PapuaHardyNet> That is what AIXI is, by the way

[14:29:14] <Obormot\Gaia> Reading further in _Creep, Shadow!_ ... this is where the idea of the silver cord originated! :O
[14:29:23] <quanticle> Silver cord?
[14:29:31] <Obormot\Gaia> Amazing. I would've never guessed... 
[14:31:23] <Obormot\Gaia> quanticle: One of the iconic D&D spells / powers is Astral Projection, and the way it works is this: you cast the spell, then you go into a trance, whereby your soul separates from your inert body and enters the Astral Plane. Thereafter you can travel about that realm, or you can pass into other worlds than yours (manifesting a new corporeal body, if so). (Or, of course, you can return to your own body, which ends the spell.)
[14:31:23] <Obormot\Gaia>  And...
[14:32:40] <quanticle> Oh, the connection from your soul to your body is the silver cord?
[14:32:41] <Obormot\Gaia> quanticle: ... at all times, when you are astrally projected, your astral form (or your manifested corporeal body, for that matter) is linked to your original body by a silver cord - insubstantial, visible only at its origin point (back of your neck) and for perhaps a few feet after, then trailing into nothingness, but in actuality stretching across the planes back to your dreaming body
[14:32:53] <Obormot\Gaia> If it is severed - you die!
[14:34:09] <quanticle> And that comes from _Creep, Shadow!_?
[14:34:11] <Obormot\Gaia> (Fortunately, only two things can harm an astral traveler's silver cord: a "silver sword" of a githyanki[1] psychic warrior, or the bite of an astral dreadnaught)
[14:34:16] <Obormot\Gaia> Yes, so it seems!
[14:34:36] <Obormot\Gaia> [1] Githyanki, meanwhile, were created by Charles Stross
[14:35:00] <Obormot\Gaia> (Not in a novel of his, but for a D&D sourcebook, back in the day)
[14:43:32] <rsaarelm> Oh huh, silver cord's a neat flavor for why it's specifically giths and silver sword with the psychic stuff.
[14:44:01] <rsaarelm> The silver sword was a sort of big side-quest deal in Baldur's Gate 2.
[14:44:32] <rsaarelm> And I never really figured why it's silver, because it didn't have the Witcher angle that that's what you kill werewolves with, duh.
[14:44:56] <rsaarelm> (And the game *had* hard to kill werewolves too)
[14:47:49] <rsaarelm> It's an actual occult thing, not just a fantasy trope, I figured it's probably older than some pulp era book. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_cord

It also refers to an extended synthesis of this thread and a second (the consciousness thread, passing from the soul to the physical body) that connects the physical body to the …)
[14:48:34] <rsaarelm> That says the term is from bible, but you'd want a source that ties it specifically to astral projection stuff and the idea that it can be severed just like that when your astral body is out there.
[14:48:59] <rsaarelm> Astral projection being a thing and being attacked while astral projecting being a thing of course go right back to prehistoric shamanism.

[16:17:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Man, the response to this post
[16:18:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nobody is even attempting to answer it
[16:18:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> 24 votes and it's at exactly 0!
[16:19:41] <feep> well the problem is it's uncomputable, because it's based on game theory accelerated by unconscious cognition
[16:19:49] <feep> we're not in a consequentialist regime, mentally.
[16:20:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh-huh
[16:20:16] <feep> (ofc we're in a consequentialist regime generally because everything is consequentialist)
[16:20:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure
[16:20:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> A politically inconvenient consequence of the absolutely bog-standard utilitarian viewpoint, and suddenly, bam! it's uncomputable
[16:20:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Somehow all the rest of what EA does on a regular basis isn't uncomputable!
[16:21:01] <feep> I'm not saying utilitarism is uncomputable
[16:21:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> I know what you're saying
[16:21:21] <feep> the utilitarism of ukraine is totally computable and probably favors just giving it to russsia
[16:21:22] <feep> -s
[16:21:30] <feep> well, though it may favor sanctions
[16:21:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> And I'm saying it's an excuse
[16:21:36] <feep> to make an argument for russia to sell grain cheap
[16:21:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, meanwhile: https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/QCrkSbsdAAyymAxjG/letter-russians-are-welcome-in-america#comment-AtqAZeh5hnG6TdaiE

[16:22:18] <feep> I'm saying inasmuch as we're for stopping russia invading ukraine, we're not doing it out of consequentialism at all
[16:22:25] <feep> so the computational argument is misplaced.
[16:22:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> "There’s no quick and easy path to enter the US even if you speak perfect English or even if you received an education in US universities." ... not quite right! There actually is a quick and easy path and it's called "refugee status"
[16:22:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> But otherwise, yeah, nope
[16:22:35] <feep> out of, er, numeric evaluable consequentialism
[16:22:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Which of course is totally crazy, as immigration policy)
[16:22:57] <feep> we're all the way up in "mentally evaluate the world we want to live in" levels
[16:23:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Just blatantly self-destructive on a shocking level)
[16:23:16] <feep> yeah it's dumb
[16:23:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I say this despite myself having gotten in via the aforesaid refugee status!)
[16:25:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Anyway you miss the point. Your answer is of course true, but notice that no one's giving it - why? Because exactly the view that OP is (by implication) mocking is the recent trend on LW (and adjacent spaces) to be like "the newest EA cause area: send money to help Ukrainians!"
[16:25:54] <feep> weeeeeeeeeeeeell assuming we want to help ukraine for noneffective or noncomputable reasons
[16:26:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> And he's saying "really, guys? are you actually willing to stand behind your implied numercial value assignments there?"
[16:26:03] <feep> there's still an ea answer of how to do this most effectively
[16:26:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Nope, that ship has sailed long ago
[16:26:13] <feep> though you need to be honest about your first cause
[16:26:18] <feep> for instance
[16:26:35] <feep> I want to know where to spend $1 to destroy the maximal $russian ability to make war
[16:26:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: EA is not in fact about "the most effective way to do <your choice of cause>"; EA is about "which is best cause, btw your prior opinions or personal values about this are irrelevant, DO THE MOST GOOD"
[16:26:59] <feep> there is no "the most good" without evaluation of personal values tho.
[16:27:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> I agree!
[16:27:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: The view you are expounding is an argument I made, on LW, many years ago, and *lost*.
[16:27:15] <feep> the point of ea has always been that it's levered widely held commitments to human equality.
[16:27:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I mean that my view lost the memetic battle, of course, not that I "lost the argument")
[16:27:32] <feep> but this is not a necessary component, just an incidental one.
[16:27:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes! I agree! But pretty much nobody in EA agrees!
[16:27:52] <feep> if we hold all humans to be equal in moral worth, then ea provides a space to spend money
[16:27:58] <feep> .... well that's busted
[16:28:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> EA as a movement rejects your view
[16:28:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> And has, again, for many years now
[16:28:19] <feep> I wouldn't know, I'm not sure if I should take your word, so let me just say
[16:28:25] <feep> shitty, if true. :p
[16:28:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have followed this closely for like 10+ years now
[16:28:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Take my word for it
[16:28:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> I *just last week* read a post by Holden Karnofsky that traced the origins of this choice of viewpoint
[16:29:45] <feep> it doesn't make any sense tho. there is no good without values.
[16:30:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> You misunderstand
[16:31:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course there is no good without values, but basically what they're doing is taking the Sam Harris view (with slightly different emphasis)
[16:31:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e.
[16:31:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Our actions are informed by our values, obviously. And what are our values? To do the most good, right? Right. And thus ..."
[16:32:16] <feep> that doesn't make any sense!
[16:32:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then if someone goes "well what I don't want to do the most good" they go "well ok I guess don't do that? but our movement is for like, normal, good people, who want good things and not bad things *shrug*"
[16:33:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> And if someone goes "well what if I disagree with you about what constitutes 'the most good'" they go "well our arguments are v. convincing tho"
[16:33:14] <feep> well, then it seems like they're still working on this model
[16:33:23] <feep> they're just holding the root values unexamined and implicit.
[16:33:29] <feep> which is gonna lead to hilarity
[16:33:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> And by "hilarity" you mean the last decade+ of the EA movement
[16:33:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which, yes, is what has been led to
[16:34:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Seriously though read that Holden post
[16:34:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Where he's like
[16:34:15] <feep> I don't care that much
[16:35:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> "We had to pick *something* that was probably 'the most good', and we had *literally no basis whatsoever* for picking anything, so... I just... picked 'helping save African children's lives' ... because... no particular reason?"
[16:35:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then that somehow turned out to actually be "the most good" even after a decade of research and evaluation, what a lucky happenstance!
[16:35:56] <feep> this is not how I remember it
[16:36:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's what he wrote!
[16:36:10] <feep> maybe he forgot
[16:36:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm not making this up! You want quotes? Here
[16:36:18] <feep> I don't! I don't care that much
[16:36:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Dude he quoted *his own report* from back then.
[16:36:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> He did not forget
[16:37:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway it's not just that post
[16:37:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's mountains of writing by EA bigwigs where they detail their philosophy
[16:37:52] <feep> well that's all very disappointing
[16:37:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> I really cannot emphasize enough that this is not me making inferences about what I think they believe
[16:38:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or psychoanalyzing them based on vague kremlinology
[16:38:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's all very explicit and clear and laid out in great detail and at length

[18:09:02] <gwern> quanticle: it's no accident, you know. why do you think I'm so interested in experience curves? it's because even mundan experience curves like the aggregate '10% decrease per doubling' for vaguely defined 'information technology' is itself a hard takeoff datapoint when you start thinking about a seed AI suddenly getting access to world-scale compute and able to start turning over...

[18:10:08] <gwern> ardent[m]: it's 'insight porn' not because it has conclusions (lots of stuff has conclusions, much like opinions or assholes) but because it has a *big* conclusion which will make you go 'oh my god this explains/changes *everything*!' (even if it's still highly uncertain)
[18:10:42] <PapuaHardyNet> (which is a very good description of "insight porn" in fact)
[18:11:59] <rsaarelm> PapuaHardyNet: I think the food thing in DCSS was that managing food basically felt like a solved problem for experienced players.
[18:12:32] <gwern> it makes you lean back from your computer experiencing the mental orgasm of all sorts of disparate things suddenly *clicking*. it's better than real orgasms because less cleanup (at least initially)
[18:12:44] <rsaarelm> There's been a lot of the general sort of gamist optimization, maybe less verisimilitude style design decisions in DCSS.
[18:14:20] <PapuaHardyNet> rsaarelm: that seems kind of dumb, don't you think? the skill of managing hunger is a positive feedback loop that's part of the meta-game, just like everything else. It being a solved problem doesn't make it a candidate for removal.

[18:15:33] <rsaarelm> PapuaHardyNet: The problem is that it's busywork that doesn't feel like it ties much into general playing-with-mastery once you do have it figured out.
[18:16:38] <PapuaHardyNet> how does someone who supports the removal of hunger differentiate between "busywork" and "general playing-with-mastery"? Both can be represented by computable functions that can be blindly followed.
[18:16:45] <rsaarelm> The general reason why roguelikes have a food mechanic is to prevent the player from grinding at low levels and healing to full health after every encounter.
[18:17:21] <rsaarelm> PapuaHardyNet: They play the game and go "I like this part but that part feels like a chore"
[18:17:21] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: I think the difference is that very few or no people can do 'mastery' while many people can do 'busywork'. it's the difference between tic-tac-toe and chess
[18:17:42] <rsaarelm> Like, everyone hates Sokoban levels in NetHack.
[18:17:55] <PapuaHardyNet> I see. The idea is to remove low cognitive automable / understandable problems
[18:17:59] <gwern> hunger-related choices are not 'a series of interesting choices' because in each one many people can predict the next move with ~100% accuracy
[18:18:00] <rsaarelm> Yeah.
[18:18:07] <PapuaHardyNet> that is an actual and sensible reasoning for removing hunger

[23:12:50] <gwern> Ralith: see the previous 2 screenshots
[23:13:53] <Ralith> you appear to have transitioned directly from technical layout issues to fun story about weird people
[23:14:01] <Ralith> (which, presumably, incidentally illustrates some layout issues)
[23:14:11] <Ralith> but the story is the part I am wondering about
[23:14:25] <gwern> 'I enter the Odyssey Jet Aviation terminal.There are people here, and they are very, very rich. They are so tall, and so healthy. They aren't dressed flashy, but their clothes fit very well and they are fit people. They are handsome, and beautiful.I am carrying a wet cardboard box full of christmas lights and veggie patties. I walk to the front desk and stammer out my name, and am told that...
[23:14:31] <gwern> ...there is no such name registered. Some very rich people look at me, and then they look at the staff, perhaps wondering how this random homeless man was allowed to infiltrate this place of supreme wealth. The staff maintain genuinely impressive poker faces.'
[23:14:55] <gwern> (he is exaggerating. or at least, the rich people weren't there when I was there)
[23:15:24] <gwern> (or maybe I am just rich and tall and healthy and my clothes fit well so I fit in? :thinking_face:)
[23:16:00] <gwern> '-Yes, the last seaplane flight is notionally at 5:30 -But the pilots want an hour to get ready -Yes, they were supposed to be on standby -Yes, standby means that they are already ready -Well, they're not at the airport right now and can't actually get back in time -Because they figured you weren't coming, so they left early -Uhhhh -Yes, we're sorry about that'
[23:16:05] <gwern> ah, ~island life~
[23:16:34] <Ralith> who are these people, what are they doing, why do they need a thousand feet of christmas lights
[23:17:00] <Betawolf> you've obviously never been to a rich person's party
[23:17:12] <Betawolf> (neither have I)
[23:17:24] <Ralith> I gather christmas lights feature prominently
[23:19:00] <Ralith> also where is the rest
[23:19:18] <gwern> the christmas light strings were for stringing along the paths and into the 3 villas for holding talks or just hanging out and like watching movies. a bunch of us watched _Littlefoot_. apparently the little group of "human researchers" investigating the conspiracy theory that an outside world full of 'littlefeet' exists is felt to be a good analogy for being a rationalist
[23:19:55] <gwern> (once the lights were installed, I pointed out that there were actually quite a lot of LED lights already installed at the resort. now I feel worse knowing that aaron went through all this to get those lights...)
[23:20:26] <gwern> Ralith: oh, here's the ending: https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-164711460314546.png

[23:21:58] <gwern> (to be fair, the veggie patties are actually pretty good. can't say the same about the veggie hotdogs)
[23:22:11] <Ralith> why is this story presented in the form of extremely narrow screenshots
[23:23:02] <gwern> Ralith: I had it popped up as a Slack side-thread because I had asked a question in the channel about good places to get an evil Clippy illustration for my story
[23:23:45] <Ralith> veggie patties are definitely not as bad as I feared they might be, but they've got a ways to go
[23:24:01] <Ralith> generally speaking
[23:24:51] <Ralith> I still have no idea what the context for any of this is but oh well
[23:24:58] <gwern> I remember trying a bunch back in the '90s, so perhaps my standards are lenient, but at least for 'a bunch of patties sitting out in a buffet line' they were as tasty as some regular burgers if I fried them and let them sit a bit
[23:25:30] <gwern> Ralith: the context is for the past week I and a bunch of other rationalist types were in the bahamas at a resort as a quasi-conference put together at the last minute when whatever the original conference was fell apart
[23:25:56] <gwern> and there were loads of logistical issues relating to flying from the main bahama island to the actual island and also covid testing and other stuff
[23:26:01] <Ralith> is this someone relating their experience trying to facilitate that in a slack monologue?
[23:26:05] <gwern> yes
[23:26:12] <Ralith> okay, thanks
[23:26:51] <Ralith> I make very good burgers from scratch on a regular basis so my standards are fairly high, but I have had beef burgers that were worse than the fake burger I tried recently
[23:26:54] <Ralith> (learn to season things, people)
[23:27:17] <gwern> yesterday there were further logistical issues when the plane just... didn't show up. so there's some rationalists hanging around nassau today. including eliezer but I think that was at least deliberate
[23:28:45] <gwern> Ralith: my conclusion too: "the distribution of commercial plant burgers now considerably overlaps commercial meat burgers"

[23:29:48] <Ralith> I think the bar for that is probably lower than people usually imagine, but I also think people are usually accustomed to the low end of that bar, so probably that's fine
[23:30:17] *** Quits: Lord_of_Life (~Lord@user/lord-of-life/x-2819915) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[23:30:20] <Ralith> idk how representative my experiences are but I've found that a lot of traditional american foods are usually made very badly
[23:30:40] <Ralith> perhaps because people who have no idea what they're doing in a kitchen feel entitled to make them
[23:31:38] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[23:32:46] <Ralith> practically every instance of "traditional american food, but with actually good ingredients and a competent chef" has been a memorable experience for me
[23:35:23] <Ralith> christmas light person is a good writer
[23:37:58] <gwern> gonzo is a familiar style
[23:39:01] <Ralith> less about relating the events and more about relating the subjective experience, eh?
[23:42:08] <galambo__> kuudes, do you know this channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRaLohr-HPfsz2SXg4hTyEA

[23:42:52] <gwern> yes, although the events do need to be suitably outrageous as to induce a compounding subjective experience
[23:48:43] <Ralith> compounding?
[23:48:46] * gwern actually can't get his chromium to do hyphenation *at all*, whether in a popin or anywhere else. wtf. 'Version 99.0.4844.51 (Official Build) snap (64-bit)' '2022'. should definitely support hyphens... ok time to leave it to th experts and move on
[23:49:20] <gwern> Ralith: sure. you don't just tell one incident, you tell a sequence which build on each other, putting one into ever stranger and more gonzo headspaces and physical spaces, for a sustained cumulative effect
[23:49:51] <gwern> Ralith: it's not simply him walking into one place with a soggy cardboard, it's walking into multiple ones, culminating in a luxury hotel
[23:50:17] <Ralith> ah, it hadn't occurred to me that that might be characteristic of the style
[23:50:31] <Ralith> makes sense though, I can see how that carries the narrative
[23:50:47] *** Joins: _inky (~inky_@46.36.114.138)
[23:51:01] <gwern> (if I had been writing it, I would have included some lines about the wealthy people in the hotel lobby or how he carried it to his room and placed it gently in the middle of the giant table in pride of place)
[23:51:25] <gwern> "we can't stop here, it's burger country!"
[23:51:48] <Ralith> $250 for a night at a swanky hotel actually seems kind of cheap
[23:52:28] <gwern> last minute stay, empty room
[23:53:05] <gwern> there's tons of low-utilized hotel rooms so he could go anywhere else on the island (lots of hotels, and I saw what seemed like half of them on one of my own taxi odysseys)
[23:53:44] <Ralith> is it typical for hotels to offer drastically lower prices in those circumstances?
[23:54:25] <gwern> I think so. I've fired up google maps at like 11PM in a dense area of hotels and seen tons of competing offers from nice hotels at like $99/night. it's the same logic for standby airfares costing very little
[23:54:26] <Ralith> figured that'd be the sort of thing where you'd naively expect a low price due to something something EMH but actually there's less obvious status issues driving everything
[23:54:33] <Ralith> nice
[23:54:38] <gwern> sometimes markets really are competitive!
[23:56:07] <Ralith> sounds like you could have a pretty good travel experience by arranging to be places during known periods of low utilization, having a flexible schedule, and not booking anything in advance
[23:56:33] <gwern> yes. but stressful. that is the time honored approach of hitchhikers and budget travelers: trade money for time/risk
[23:57:11] <gwern> sometimes you get to the gate and there's 20 seats and you fly practically for free. sometimes you get there and the last flight out is actually overbooked and they're dangling money in front of people to get them to walk off
[23:57:27] <Ralith> hence the flexible schedule
[23:57:38] <Ralith> probably not good if you actually need to be anywhere in particular anywhen in particular
[23:58:06] <gwern> yup. like, say, an island 50 miles over with only a few flights in and out a day and an event starting soon
[23:58:17] <Ralith> quite
[23:58:41] <Ralith> as someone who generally finds travel to be categorically stressful now I'm kind of intrigued at having a lazy wander around $LOCATION sometime
[23:59:10] <gwern> I think that would be way easier these days with smartphones
