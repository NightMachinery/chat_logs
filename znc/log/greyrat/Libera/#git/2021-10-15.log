[03:56:01] <ZacSharp> you mean in the submodule in the superproject or in the reference repo?
[03:58:03] <nvmd> can be either. I generally do it in the submodule inside the superproject, saves me from the redundancy of updating the separate repo and then updating the submodule in the superproject

[04:32:27] <ZacSharp> it doesn't but it seems like --recurse-submodules combined with --depth does not apply --depth to the submodules as well
[04:32:52] <ZacSharp> from the name I'd guess that's what --shallow-submodules is for

[12:10:01] <makara> at the moment I can't even get them to behave differently. An example would probably make it clear
[12:10:51] <canton7> makara, 'checkout' has two different functions -- it's used to change branches, and move files between branches. That was confusing, so the functionality was split into 'switch' and 'restore'
[12:12:05] <makara> oh, so branch switching behaviour is identical!?

[14:01:53] <acidjnk_new3> hello
[14:03:31] <acidjnk_new3> Using Git Flow, I've made a small bugfix branch from develop. 1 small commit by me, another one from another person. But now I want to rebase it to the next release branch. Just do it and "accept theirs" for all the pom.xml which have a "conflicting" version? Or will there be chaos?

[14:06:03] <Flow> acidjnk_new3: not sure if this is a git flow question. as far as I understand your situation, "accept theirs" would simply override all the changes of pom.xml made in your small bugfix branch
[14:07:00] <Flow> hence I tend to believe it depends on the changes you made and the other branch if there will be chaos if you simply drop your changes
[14:08:42] <acidjnk_new3> I did not change pom.xml, but the develop branch obviously did!
[14:08:51] <acidjnk_new3> There are no "real" conflicts.
[14:10:44] <osse> sounds like you're rebasing more commits than intended
[14:11:03] <osse> git rebase --onto=next-release develop  is the command to use
[14:11:12] <osse> git status should tell you how many commits you're rebasing
[14:11:46] *** MrC is now known as MrSpooky
[14:13:11] <acidjnk_new3> ok, thanks. I thought I had to go to my tiny bugfix branch, and then just git rebase release/...?
[14:14:57] *** Joins: rewrit3 (~rewrit3@user/rewrit3)
[14:17:24] <osse> acidjnk_new3: then you rebase everything in the range release/foo..bugfix

[16:34:35] <acidjnk_new3> But imo, the main reason for the "conflicts" here is that they obviously changed the version in the 30 pom.xml: Removed the -SNAPSHOT for the release branch, and upped the version for develop. So if I just merge with "accept theirs" for all conflicts, it'll probably be fine.

[16:43:54] <Anticom> Swahili: Stuff in square brackets usually means that they're optional arguments / flags
[16:44:41] <Anticom> You rarely ever need the -- as a seperator to let the command know that the following path is not a flag etc. Typically you can ignore that. So what you'd have to do is simply `git submodule update ./path/to/module` and you should be done.

Use `git submodule update --init` instead of `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`, that way it's one less thing to remember :)

[18:31:43] <linguist> bookworm: well, yeah, maybe 10 minutes would do fine... I just need to learn about changes in time
[18:32:38] <PhrozenByte> Hi everyone, I'm working on a CI pipeline right now and need to dynamically choose the branch/tag to checkout. For choosing the right branch/tag I need a full list of branches and tags. I then do a `git fetch --depth=1` and checkout the code. The repos I'm working with can be huge (i.e. fetching is very time consuming).
[18:32:38] <PhrozenByte> What is faster? A full `git fetch` and `git for-each-ref`, or `git ls-remote` and `git fetch --depth=1`?
[18:32:57] <linguist> I'm autistic and I kinda spend long times in tasks most people would do very quickly, so a couple of times I was reporting something, i.e. a test case that failed, just to learn it has been solved before I finished an e-mail

[18:37:54] <PhrozenByte> isn't this basically the same anyway?

[18:38:37] <osse> but if it's wiped then every fetch will be an initial fetch, so to speak.

[19:00:55] <Swahili> Q: What's the most straight forward way to update a particular branch to be in synch with remote origin? E.g. I often do git pull origin <branch> and then git reset --hard origin/<branch>, I understand this might not be the most succinct way, so wondering what other people do? Thanks!
[19:01:10] <codebam> since the stashed changes weren't committed and I still want to commit them on another branch
[19:01:10] <mgedmin> git stash apply doesn't remove the stash; you were thinking about git stash pop

[20:09:42] <anddam> howdy, I have two separate roots in a repo, I want to rebase one on top of the other
[20:10:01] <anddam> I am going to do   rebase --onto first-head second-root second-head
[20:10:07] <anddam> is that the proper way?
[20:14:01] <j416> depends on which one you want to base on the other
[20:14:22] <j416> also you probably want --root
[20:14:49] <j416> also depends on the reason you are doing this
[20:15:05] <j416> you might get away with graft + filter-branch
[20:17:10] <anddam> there was an hg project whose head was used to start a git one
[20:17:43] <anddam> I added the old history using hggit, but it's its own separate tree
[20:18:23] <anddam> the two people working on the repo prefer to have the old history and are willing to checkout after the merge and force push
[20:18:31] <j416> so you are not looking to merge together actual data, but only keep the old history?
[20:19:08] <j416> and one branch is a continuation of the other, except its first commit happens to be a root commit instead of something on top of what it should logically be the continuation of?
[20:23:00] <anddam> yep
[20:23:17] <anddam> well it's dirtier than that, but that's the gist
[20:24:05] <anddam> j416: I just thought it was a matter of rebasing onto one head the other tree, from root (that first comit you mentioned) up to master (the actual head)
[20:24:09] <j416> then I'd look at graft + filter-branch.
[20:24:17] <j416> man git-replace for graft
[20:24:17] <gitinfo> the git-replace manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-replace.html
[20:24:29] <j416> man git-filter-branch for making the graft permanent
[20:24:29] <gitinfo> the git-filter-branch manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-filter-branch.html
[20:24:38] <j416> also !backup
[20:24:38] <gitinfo> Worried about your data while trying stuff out in your repo? The repository in its entirety lives inside the .git directory in the root of your work tree so to backup everything `cp -a path/to/workdir path/to/backup` or equivalent will suffice as long as the repo is not modified during backup. See also http://sethrobertson.github.com/GitBestPractices/#backups
[20:25:11] <j416> and note that you'll have to update not only this branch but possibly other branches and tags if you have those

[20:26:05] <anddam> j416: there are only two branches, so I am doing the same thing twice and that's it
[20:26:13] <anddam> I'll look at graft
[20:26:34] <j416> anddam: or once, and then just regularly rebase --onto the second branch, for example
[20:26:37] <j416> whichever seems easier
[20:26:48] <anddam> why rebase?
[20:26:55] <j416> if you find it easier
[20:27:05] <anddam> I mean why regularly
[20:27:12] <anddam> isn't this done only once?
[20:27:15] <j416> but, you should be able to simply add just one graft and then run filter-branch on each of the branches
[20:27:18] <j416> perhaps simplest.
[20:27:40] <j416> regularly, I meant that to mean "as usual"
[20:27:45] <j416> sorry
[20:28:00] <j416> might've misused the word
[20:28:12] <anddam> ok, I'll later look into splitting those two branches into separate repos, I think this was covered in filter-branch page, is that right?
[20:28:21] <anddam> j416: it's fine
[20:28:38] <j416> if you have two separate branches already, there's no need for filter-branch
[20:28:50] <j416> just put one in a different repo
[20:29:05] <j416> but this is something different from your original question

[22:56:12] <ash_worksi> how do I look at how far I am away from the remote in terms of commits?
[22:56:21] <ash_worksi> (ie: I committed and haven't pushed yet)
[22:56:35] <ikke> ash_worksi: git log --oneline --graph --all
[22:56:37] <ikke> for example
[22:56:45] <ikke> but I use tig as an interactive browser
[22:56:49] <ikke> gitk is also possible
[22:56:50] * imMute has an alias for 'log --graph --pretty=format:'%C(auto)%h %C(green)%an %Cblue%ar%Creset%C(auto)%d %s %Creset' --author-date-order --decorate=short'
[22:56:57] <ash_worksi> huh
[22:57:00] <ash_worksi> tig you say
[22:57:12] <ash_worksi> is that a standalone application?
[22:57:12] <ikke> Yes, but it's a third-party tool
[22:57:15] <ikke> and it's terminal based
[22:57:32] <ash_worksi> I wonder if it's in the ubuntu repos
[22:57:35] <ikke> should be
