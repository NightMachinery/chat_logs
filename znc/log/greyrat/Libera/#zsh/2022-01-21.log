[01:05:24] <llua> when a program behaves different when a argument is omitted
[01:05:30] <llua> for that same reason
[01:10:58] <Hello72> how can i write *(e:'[[ $REPLY > foo ]]') better
[01:11:09] <Mikachu> how much better does it have to be?
[01:11:17] <phy1729> include the trailing : ?
[01:11:21] <Mikachu> and what metric are we using
[01:11:35] <Mikachu> using * instead of : means you can use any character inside the quoted string which is a nice feature
[01:11:49] <Mikachu> eg *(e:*'foo : * '*) will work fine
[01:12:41] <FreeBDSM> llua, do you have any good examples with some common / widely used utils?
[01:12:42] <phy1729> That doesn't appear to be documented
[01:12:48] <Hello72> i mean *(e:'[[ $REPLY > foo ]]':). what does *(e:*'foo : * '*) do
[01:13:02] <Hello72> it seems to just print zsh: unknown file attribute:
[01:13:08] <Mikachu> Hello72: it's just nonsense code
[01:13:15] <Mikachu> i only wanted to hilight you could use * inside the string
[01:13:40] <FreeBDSM> also, is there an option to not store dupes AT ALL? like HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST, but more aggressive (this one only affects whether to store SEQUENTIAL dupes)?
[01:14:19] <Hello72> i want to use it interactively without typing out (e:'[[ $REPLY > and  ]]':)
[01:14:23] <FreeBDSM> err, copied wrong option
[01:14:33] <Mikachu> you can define a function
[01:14:55] <Mikachu> then you just need *(e:'myfunction foo':)
[01:15:03] <FreeBDSM> (meant HIST_IGNORE_DUPES)
[01:15:05] <Mikachu> or if you can hardcode foo in the function, *(+myfunction)
[01:15:10] <Hello72> i guess that's less bad
[01:15:26] <Mikachu> i also have a keybind to type the boring stuff automatically and quote the string afterwards
[01:15:38] <FreeBDSM> wait, histignorealldups exists, is that what I want?
[01:16:27] <Mikachu> http://mika.l3ib.org/tmp/58483a27e4d10c426845cc797a7adf72.txt
[01:17:03] <Hello72> huh, zsh successfully converts *(e:'[[ $REPLY > [TAB] to *(e:\[\[\ \$REPLY\ \>\ which is impressive but i'm not sure is better

[01:19:20] <Hello72> i was hoping to write *([foo,]) but foo is a variable there and also ,] isn't valid, it needs to be ,-1]
[01:19:50] <llua> FreeBDSM: ls
[01:19:52] <Hello72> i guess after() { [[ $REPLY > $1 ]]; }; *(e:'after foo') isn't *terrible*
[01:20:08] <Mikachu> Hello72: is there any reason why you're not just using <foo->
[01:20:14] <Mikachu> instead of that whole *(e thing
[01:20:26] <Hello72> i thought that was only for numbers
[01:20:39] <Hello72> is that another <>
[01:21:00] <Mikachu> oh > works for strings, sorry
[01:21:16] <Hello72> yes, > not -gt
[01:21:24] <FreeBDSM> llua, please, remind, will setting such an option in my ~/.zshrc affect the work of `ls *` in scripts executed from files?
[01:22:22] <llua> 1, no. 2, just don't set the option anyway.
[01:22:40] <FreeBDSM> okay, thanks, but only because you say so
[01:22:42] <llua> you can toggle the behavior on, on a per glob basis

[01:32:07] <FreeBDSM> so there's `setopt histsavenodups` but it still saves dupes to histfile. And not only when a command exists in histfile, but even when the memory has non-sequential dupes. Well, that sucks :c
[01:32:56] <FreeBDSM> I'd like my histfile to become a bit more like a file with notes and I'd like all stored commands there to be strictly unique

[01:37:00] <FreeBDSM> I wonder if there are like-minded people and whether there are solutions that provide a way to have 2 histfiles: one 'clean' and one 'unclean', with dupes and all that
[01:38:24] <FreeBDSM> can zsh switch (in the active shell on the go) the histfile it works with to another location?
[01:46:36] <llua> notes usually stay as written. if you perform a sequence of commands then look back at those notes and part of them is missing because it happened to be a duplicate of something later, you lost context
[01:47:30] <llua> its data corruption that you are opting into
[01:48:31] <llua> even the runtime if sequential duplicate events can be useful, or the fact that you had to run it multiple times to achieve something
[01:48:39] <llua> runtime of*
[01:48:55] <FreeBDSM> I simply don't rely on the order of commands from histfile, but I'd prefer it to stay for the 'in memory' history.
[01:51:44] <FreeBDSM> with fzf using ctrl+r for history search - it's just a blessing I now rely very heavily on. I rely on it so much that I'd like my history to be kept clean, but I don't want to manually cleanup the file that is 11k long right now
[01:53:34] <llua> anyway, you can change HISTFILE as many times as you want.
[01:53:54] <llua> that does nothing for the in memory events though.
[01:54:08] <FreeBDSM> oooor, it would be awesome to have a hotkey like delete (or delete with some modifier key) to be able to delete highlighted line (when in ctrl+r mode) right from the histfile

[03:22:10] <llua> yes
[03:28:33] <zenof> so, to dump the default keymap, add my modifications and later load it I have to just source the output of bindkey -L, or is there any other way to have a named keymap to reuse?

[20:14:03] <zenof> hey there. I have in my zshenv  'bindkey -v; bindkey "^?" backward-delete-char' but zsh still uses 'bindkey "^?" vi-backward-delete-char'. when I manually run 'bindkey "^?" backward-delete-char' zsh respects that. how can I fix that?

[20:15:23] <llua> people use zshenv for the weirdest things
[20:18:21] <zenof> that's not an answer. do you think keybindings should go to some other place? sure, zshenv is read every time a zsh is invoked. this slows down things, but do you remember my problem from yesterday? how else could I fix that? source a separate file?
[20:18:46] <llua> it wasn't meant as a answer
[20:19:45] <llua> but yes, i do think keybinds make more sense to be in the file sourced by interactive shells since its a very interactive feature
[20:20:45] <zenof> right. but still a shell scrip invokation of vared is interactive and shellscripts usually don't source zshrc, do they?
[20:21:11] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[20:21:16] <llua> nope, but why would you not make your shellscript not be self contained
[20:21:28] <Mikachu> you can't invoke vared from a script so problem solved
[20:21:34] <llua> you can
[20:21:43] <Mikachu> vared: ZLE not enabled
[20:21:51] <llua> yeah, you have to enable it
[20:22:05] <Mikachu> this should probably be the first hint that you're doing something funny
[20:23:40] <llua> shell scripts depending on a user's dotfile is very csh like
[20:24:05] <llua> or csh-era thinking
[20:26:07] <zenof> okay, maybe I set up my keybindings up in another place soon. still, without the script part and in an completely interactive shell: I still have the problem that 'bindkey -v; bindkey "^?" backward-delete-char' is somehow not working ,as a 'bindkey -L' gives 'bindkey "^?" vi-backward-delete-char', and vi-backward-delete-char only deletes up to where the last vi insert mode was entered.
[20:26:55] <zenof> and yes I am testing this in a completely clean, newly set up environment, both on my machine directly and in a VM. in both I get the same behaviour.
[20:27:43] <zenof> so how can I bind the (emacs style) widget 'backward-delete-char' to my backspace?
[20:29:56] <llua> https://asciinema.org/a/KpWvVA6Z2KMshogAFwjcj60wY
[20:29:57] <zenof> Mikachu: why would using vared in a shell script be funny? what would be a better way to get user input? I am open to learn...
[20:30:19] <Mikachu> normally i would use read

[21:13:38] <llua> your .zshenv is one of the first files sourced, anything after has the chance to change it
[21:13:48] <llua> hence my first statement when you entered
[21:14:01] <llua> one of the reasons anyway
[21:14:37] <llua> +bind2maps:16> bindkey -M viins $'\C-?' vi-backward-delete-char <- that line overrides it
[21:14:46] <llua> most likely from debian's global zshrc
[21:15:11] <llua> if your binds were in /your/ zshrc, which is sourced after it, you wouldn't have had that problem
[21:15:53] <llua> but you know, keep using that .zshenv if you want.
[21:16:35] <Mikachu> you can also say setopt noglobalrcs in your .zshenv to avoid weird debian crap
[21:16:53] <Mikachu> except /etc/zshenv which is always parsed
[21:17:47] <zenof> llua, may I ask you why you didn't explain this along with that first statement when I entered? why do you now say things like that? as if I should have known better?

[21:20:17] <llua> again, my first statement wasn't an attempt to help. it wasn't until i posted a way to trace your start up that i was in a helping mood.
[21:20:42] <llua> so i explained it after confirming what i thought

[21:27:13] <zenof> llua: "but you know, keep using that .zshenv if you want." to me sounds like if I was somewhat stubborn with the zshenv thing. I am not. I'm just not really familiar with how these things all work.
