[00:06:28] <foobaz> i think there's a problem connecting 'import "example"' to tempconv.go

[00:08:49] <fizzie> My guess is, it's finding example.FreezingC just fine, it's just not finding the FreezingC of `example.KToC(FreezingC)`.
[00:09:01] <fizzie> Which would have to be `example.KToC(example.FreezingC)` instead.

[01:10:25] <foobaz> the time handling is much like the other issues he raises in that go attempts to simplify things as much as possible, and sometimes this results in oversimplification, i.e. a leaky abstraction

[01:11:30] <foobaz> but what is the solution to that kind of issue? don't simplify things? that doesn't work, because exposing the full complexity of the underlying system is not desirable either
[01:12:21] <foobaz> it's a judgement call, both simplicity and complexity have benefits, and it's necessary to choose a tradeoff
[01:13:00] <seebs> i've consistently found Go's time stuff to Basically Work Correctly
[01:13:07] <pyzozord> just to be clear: I love go mainly for the simplicity
[01:13:15] <foobaz> go often chooses simplicity in the standard library, but it also supports C and assembly if you want to get complicated
[01:13:26] <b0nn> I've consistently whined about Go's date parsing :)

[01:14:11] <seebs> but like. if i want to do hand-parsing, i can, if i don't want to, i don't have to, and the Reference Time makes it really easy to read things.

[03:42:49] <blinux> The Jetbrains process to get a student license doesn't seem to work. It just keeps sending me in cirlces.
[03:44:00] <blinux> I try to apply for a license and it says use the extention link in your account, I go there and no link, but just buy. I also remember when I tried earlier it said it couldn't link it to my account and contact sales, now I don't see this. It is super confusing to just get working.

[11:57:17] <LordDoskias> is there a way to make that part of go.mod evaluated only if it's indeed going to be used by something being built?

[16:47:12] <TomyWork> I'm trying to figure out how to build someone's go project given a readme with no build instructions and a jenkins log with a command that doesn't work for me and almost zero go knowledge.
[16:47:59] <TomyWork> the command is: go build -o /path/to/binary path/to/source.go
[16:48:01] <ikke> try `go build` or `go build ./...`

[16:48:27] <ikke> TomyWork: is path/to/source.go a main package (does it contain 'package main')?
[16:48:59] *** Joins: treeford (~charleste@user/treeford)
[16:49:09] <TomyWork> yes it does
[16:50:41] <TomyWork> it says: cannot find package "<git repo url on our internal gitlab>/internal/commands"
[16:51:54] <TomyWork> I'm gonna deobfuscate the command line a bit: go build -o bin/<application name> cmd/<short application name>/<Short application name>.go
[16:53:29] <TomyWork> that gitlab url is the url to that exact project, btw
[16:53:47] <fizzie> Is there a go.mod file around there, and does it have `module <git repo url on our internal gitlab>` in it? And if so, does the directory ./internal/commands exist, relative to that go.mod file?
[16:54:05] <TomyWork> I'm not sure how the jenkins job is finding that package. I'm guessing they built it differently at some point and it has just kinda reused the old build somehow
[16:54:16] <TomyWork> there is a go.mod
[16:54:43] <TomyWork> and yes there is that line and yes that directory exists
[16:55:34] <TomyWork> "go build" errors with "can't load package: package .: no Go files in <current directory>", btw
[16:55:58] <fizzie> That probably just means there's no Go source in the root directory, which is fair enough.
[16:56:31] <TomyWork> there's a .idea directory, too
[16:56:55] *** Joins: ekathva_ (~ekathva@2001:999:51:1ac7:eb43:36ae:d67e:26d9)
[16:57:54] <fizzie> It all sounds slightly curious. Because if you're running a `go build` in a directory that's "under" a go.mod file, and that go.mod file says `module example.com/something`, then any references to packages of the form "example.com/something/foo/bar" should just resolve to the directory ./foo/bar relative to the go.mod file.
[16:58:05] <TomyWork> and .idea is listed in .gitignore :D

[16:59:53] <TomyWork> go version go1.10.4 linux/amd64 - maybe that's too old?
[17:00:02] <TomyWork> it's from ubuntu 18.04's repos
[17:00:18] <ikke> yes, I don't think that supports modules
[17:00:24] <TomyWork> i see
[17:00:40] <ikke> iirc, that was added in 1.11

[19:58:37] <bookworm> so read the stdlib docs? They usually show you examples
[19:58:52] <blacked> :)ok but  i feel
[19:59:29] <bookworm> as for concurrency there's a bunch of neat gophercon talks on YouTube or a book from packt that only shows you patterns
[19:59:55] <blacked> gophercon talks on YouTube :/
[20:00:17] <bookworm> what's wrong with that?
[20:01:35] <blacked> no no not wrong, i'm thinking, and searching but i feel i will be trapped by tutorial hell, but gophercon official people , makes good
[20:01:58] <bookworm> just start writing code or read code from other people
[20:02:06] <blacked> ok :)

[20:05:15] <bookworm> if you have a shiny new hammer everything looks like a nail doesn't it?
[20:05:28] <ikke> There is also a book called concurrency in go
[20:05:29] <bookworm> the ecosystem has been through that, don't worry.

[20:06:59] <bookworm> considering that all it does is show you different versions of the hammer
[20:07:17] <blacked> oh there is 2017 version only in `concurrency in go`
[20:07:43] <bookworm> goroutines didn't change fundamentally
[20:08:25] <bookworm> all that happened is that you got some implementations of common patterns in the stdlib packages but the patterns still apply
[20:08:47] <blacked> oh ok .
[20:08:51] <bookworm> and if you can write those by hand, you should be able to understand the sync package as well

[20:12:24] <bookworm> to the former, the latter, depends. Yes you can mostly statically build go for some target platforms
[20:12:44] <bookworm> those that don't force syscalls to go over libc

[23:46:14] <lilgopher> is it normal to name a package handler where I write the http handlers of an api like I do here in /internal/handler: https://github.com/dmartzol/hmm ?
[23:46:20] <j416> perhaps you have your own type based on a basic type but you still want to use it with a function that accepts some type
[23:46:39] <lilgopher> sometimes I'm unsure if the naming I'm using is uncommon and confusing
[23:47:04] <lilgopher> sometimes I've seen something like "controllers"
[23:47:08] <j416> lilgopher: I typically just go with "api"
[23:47:38] <lilgopher> hmm, I might go with api, it is even shorter
[23:47:53] <j416> and I don't bother with internal/
[23:48:07] <j416> just makes it longer and adds little value in most cases
[23:48:26] <lilgopher> I like the internal just so we use the same naming. What name do you use as an alternative to internal?
[23:48:35] <j416> nothing
[23:48:37] <j416> just api
[23:48:57] <lilgopher> oh, but then the rest of the libraries you put them in /internal/ or just in the root dir?
[23:49:11] *** Joins: k8yun_ (~k8yun@user/k8yun)
[23:49:14] <j416> internal is a special namespace in Go; you cannot import packages in internal from another project
[23:49:33] <j416> lilgopher: root
[23:50:27] <lilgopher> yeah, I knew that, if I dont use internal I use "pkg", but I dont like to put all libraries in the root dir, just persoanl preference
[23:50:55] <lilgopher> but I like the idea of naming "api" instead of "handler", which seems to confuse some people
[23:52:16] <j416> I sometimes use pkg/ if there are other directories with non-Go stuff, like documents or images or such; if it seems to makes it more clean
