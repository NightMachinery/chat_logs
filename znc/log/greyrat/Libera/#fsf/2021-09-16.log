[16:23:35] <GuestTHU16_1> DESCRIPTION
[16:23:36] <GuestTHU16_1> Cat reads each file in sequence and writes it on the standard output. Thus:
[16:23:36] <GuestTHU16_1> cat file
[16:23:37] <GuestTHU16_1> is about the easiest way to print a file. Also:
[16:23:37] <GuestTHU16_1> cat file1 file2 >file3
[16:23:38] <GuestTHU16_1> is about the easiest way to concatenate files.
[16:23:38] <GuestTHU16_1> If no input file is given cat reads from the standard input file.
[16:23:39] <GuestTHU16_1> If the argument − is encountered, cat reads from the standard input file.

[20:56:44] <madage> kompowiec2[x]: IMO, we've been already pushed aside as some sort of fundamentalist sect, the article offers some insights on what we need to do to overcome this sectarianism and get together with the general public on the basis of other technological concerns which are already seen and felt everywhere
[20:57:44] <kompowiec2[x]> divide and rule, polished to perfection
[20:59:00] <madage> I very much agree that the scenario has changed over the years and that licenses and fsf criteria have become too narrow to tackle the issues we are facing
[20:59:35] <Bronzu> Sorry kinda logged in late. What article?
[21:00:21] <madage> and much more with the view that we need to focus on changing society/culture overall
[21:00:29] <madage> Bronzu: https://rosenzweig.io/blog/software-freedom-isnt-about-licenses-its-about-power.html

[21:11:42] <madage> It's hard to give a one way answer to that, but what I think the article hints on and which I also agree is: we are better off showing how different issues (activism) converge with software freedom and not to make it the sole departuring point of a dialogue
[21:13:04] <madage> so starting from a power dynamics in society, or starting from e-waste we drop some hints on how software freedom may prove to be helpful
[21:13:56] <madage> and certainly we need to drop stallman as a model, it's not feasible to ask everyone to use technology the way he does
[21:14:05] <Bronzu> Free software is a great way to help the planet, you are right
[21:14:16] <madage> not even die hard activists in our movement can honour that standard
[21:14:24] <Bronzu> We may be also able to use other slogans for other groups too.
[21:16:04] <madage> we may use him instead as an example of how contrieved life became and how hard it is to make this choices alone
[21:16:19] <anton> >stallman as a model
[21:16:27] <anton> huh

[21:46:42] <Bronzu> inpost?
[21:47:06] <Bronzu> They seem to only get worse now that they essentailly have a monopoly on parcel lockers...
[21:48:49] <kompowiec2[x]> yeah inpost
[21:49:14] <kompowiec2[x]> Bronzu: well you have alternative - poste restante
[21:49:22] <kompowiec2[x]> or DHL
[21:49:47] <Bronzu> or Polish Post
[21:50:09] <Bronzu> Although the last one lacks in the quality department
[21:50:23] <kompowiec2[x]> midov start using DHL since, when they hid two packages for him in one locker and he could not open it because the application was NECESSARY.
[21:50:47] <Bronzu> Also, Allegro and it's inpost cooperation really sucks
[21:50:55] <kompowiec2[x]> Bronzu: polish post support poste restante :P
[21:50:58] <Bronzu> Basically making Smart necessary to save money
[21:51:08] <Bronzu> I hate online shopping
[21:51:11] <kompowiec2[x]> therefore i just use OLX
[21:51:14] <Bronzu> From almost every aspect
[21:51:21] <Bronzu> @kompowiec2[x], oh hell yeah
[21:51:26] <Bronzu> Just buy stuff used
[21:51:42] <kompowiec2[x]> but as for the number of idiots out there ... it must have gotten worse

[21:52:58] <kompowiec2[x]> Bronzu: you tried craiglist or ebay maybe?
