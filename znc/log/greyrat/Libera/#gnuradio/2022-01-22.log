[00:00:04] <muaddib[m]> And since you mentioned them. What do the ‘spectrum police’ look like? Since you said they come knocking on your door, I’m picturing 1950s “G-Men”??
[00:00:48] <patchvonbraun[m]> I've never met any FCC guys, but I have met the Canadian equivalent.  Nothing special :)
[00:01:33] <patchvonbraun[m]> Canada doesn't really have any spectrum enforcer types anymore.  No DFing vans, etc, etc.  
[00:05:18] <patchvonbraun[m]> I don't know if the UK still has the TV/Radio receiver licensing enforcement vans...
[00:09:09] <willcode4[m]> Those wouldn't do much good these days.
[00:09:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> willcode4: Probably not.
[00:10:58] <patchvonbraun[m]> Both because unwanted emissions requirements have become more stringent globally, and the final IF in a TV receiver likely varies a fair amount by manufacturer and model.

[07:29:13] <dcajacob[m]> Anyone ever see weirdness between using a constellation object vs. the constellation rectangle object?
[07:30:00] <dcajacob[m]> I generally use the constellation object, but I've always been vexed by the fact that implementing differential encoding (mod 4) for QPSK doesn't actually help with phase ambiguity
[07:30:47] <dcajacob[m]> I just chalked this up tome doing something wrong, but I recently noticed someone else using the rect object as an alternative and it just works!

[11:00:36] <yootis[m]> What does the following message from cmake really indicate, and what do I need to do to get rid of it?
[11:00:36] <yootis[m]> -- Not using additional GNU Radio native architecture optimizations.
[11:03:05] <drmpeg> You can set the compiler flags -march=native -ftree-vectorize
[11:03:32] <drmpeg> With -DENABLE_NATIVE
[11:03:49] <yootis[m]> thanks
[11:04:55] <drmpeg> I guess it's an option since not every CPU architecture supports -march=native.
[11:08:15] <muaddib[m]> Hey drmpeg: i just hooked an SDR to my DirecTV dish. Are there any good resources for FOSS decoders? I think I remember you said that the gr-dvbs_rx wasn't really meant for live but was for  testing the LDPC, do I have that right?
[11:09:20] <drmpeg> It's been forked and extended to a full receiver. https://github.com/igorauad/gr-dvbs2rx

[11:11:44] <drmpeg> At around 1 MSym/s.
[11:12:15] <muaddib[m]> Right on, i thought that might be the case. Seems like a good case for dedicated hardware. I'm totally out of my element here, just figured i'd give it a shot!
[11:12:15] <muaddib[m]> most of the channels are pretty wide/high rate right? 20/30MHz?
[11:12:48] <drmpeg> Yes. I think 27 MHz is standard?
[11:13:21] <drmpeg> All encrypted of course.
[11:14:20] <muaddib[m]> oh yea for sure. i was honestly just trying to see the channels. bought a house with an unused dish that was plumbed in 10ft from my lab desk how could I not? :D

[11:51:06] <muaddib[m]> congratulations!
[11:57:54] <drmpeg> RISC-V is one of the easier architectures to contribute to. A fairly small group of devs.
[12:05:23] <muaddib[m]> it's also very popular. thanks for contributing. i know i'll be using it at some point.
[12:07:27] <drmpeg> It's nice right now that there are only a few boards. I'm running a vanilla kernel with just one patch to enable blinky LEDs.
[12:07:55] <drmpeg> But everyone is predicting a big mess like ARM.
[12:08:51] <muaddib[m]> What was the arm ‘mess’?
[12:10:14] <drmpeg> Oh, there's a zillion boards and not every manufacturer upstreams their configuration. So there's many custom kernels.
[12:11:28] <drmpeg> In fact, that patch I submitted is for a specific board.
[12:13:00] <drmpeg> It's part of this things called "Device Tree".
[12:13:29] <drmpeg> Where you describe the hardware capabilities of a board.
[12:14:12] <drmpeg> It's not used for x86.
[12:15:44] <muaddib[m]> Oh right. I see what you mean.
[12:15:54] <muaddib[m]> I’ve done a lot of work with gateworks boards

[12:17:46] <drmpeg> From time to time, I check GNU Radio for 32-bit compatibility.
[12:18:09] <drmpeg> With the X15.
[12:18:24] <muaddib[m]> That’s cool.
[12:18:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> I’ve worked on ARM SOMs. I remember the device tree. Worked on Android kernels as well. Committing atrocities is rather not talk about :(
[12:21:01] <drmpeg> The X15 was pretty fast for it's time. Better than a Pi3. But now eclipsed by the Pi4.

[12:31:16] <drmpeg> Paper plants are probably the most hellish environments.
[12:31:34] <muaddib[m]> How does that relate to gateworks?
[12:31:41] <muaddib[m]> The paper part?
[12:31:55] <drmpeg> Rugged and Industrial.

[12:34:10] <muaddib[m]> Their wiki is really awesome too. I’ve used it for non gateworks related stuff. 
[12:34:10] <muaddib[m]> I had to provision like 50-100 boards at a time and they were happy to preload the boards I ordered with a custom boot-loader 
[12:34:42] <drmpeg> I just saw that -40 to +85C spec and it reminded me of those crazy paper plants.
[12:34:43] <muaddib[m]> Then I could just plug them in when they got to me and flash them right out of the box. Saved a LOT of time
[12:36:07] <drmpeg> My favorite was a toilet paper one on Oregon.
[12:37:04] <drmpeg> It's was like a 1000 feet per minute of a 20 foot wide sheet.
[12:37:44] <drmpeg> The noise level was so high, you had to use sign language.
[12:40:19] <muaddib[m]> Good grief. Hearing protection?
[12:40:53] <drmpeg> Oh yeah.
[12:41:49] <muaddib[m]> Thank goodness
[12:42:36] <drmpeg> There was another one in upstate New York that did oil filter paper.
[12:43:07] <muaddib[m]> Was control system stuff fun?
[12:43:51] <drmpeg> Yeah, it was cool stuff. Using 8080 CPUs back then.
[12:44:31] <drmpeg> The oil filter plant extracted so much water, that the humidity was 100% in the room.
[12:45:08] <drmpeg> The equipment was dripping with condensation.
[12:45:42] <muaddib[m]> Those are very harsh environments
[12:46:21] <drmpeg> It was a fun job. Lots of travel.
[12:47:13] <drmpeg> I was like 22.
[12:47:56] <drmpeg> Before I moved to Silicon Valley.
[12:49:41] <drmpeg> I had a pretty thick Boston accent. One time I went to Tuscaloosa, AL and every time I opened my mouth, someone would say "You're a Yankee right?"
[12:56:02] <drmpeg> The only thing I remember about that plant was drinking the most vile coffee I've ever had.
[12:56:49] <drmpeg> Apparently, the drinking water in Tuscaloosa was hideous back then.
[13:01:01] <muaddib[m]> Wow. That’s really interesting. Sounds cool.
[13:01:37] <muaddib[m]> I’m shutting down for the night. Thanks for sharing the stories.
[13:04:15] <drmpeg> It was a tiny little company that was part of a company that built the dryers. Run by the owners son, who was also my age.
[13:05:23] <drmpeg> We also had a private airplane and the owners son (Tommy) was the pilot.
[13:06:07] <drmpeg> So we'd take that for the close in jobs.
[13:10:12] <drmpeg> When we installed at the toilet paper plant, Tommy was showing off our relay rack to one of the plant guys. He pulls out a random relay to show the guy what we were using. Turns out that it was the one relay that was connected in series to the dryer and the whole thing shuts down.
[13:11:26] <drmpeg> Later, the plane superintendent come over and tells us how much money that cost them. Doh!
[13:11:46] <drmpeg> plant

[21:08:03] <nick40[m]> its GNU Companion 3.8.1.0 (Python 3.8.10)
[21:08:42] <jogn_1[m]> nick40[m]: yeah that's the old version, but I guess it should still work. The latest version is 3.10 (I believe)
[21:09:13] <jogn_1[m]> Check out this "checklist" for errors, might help you out

[21:17:11] <warnes[m]> Hi All, I'm getting this error when trying to use the bladeRF source or sink blocks:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/dce1ba8d3055280c90ca2d35ec7ad9fa608a2f8c)
[21:17:17] <warnes[m]> Ideas?
[21:29:48] <nick40[m]> GNU Radio Companion generates a python script that imports C/C++ libraries where the different blocks of GNU Radio are implemented right?
[21:31:03] <warnes[m]> nick40: The reference comes from a c++ file included in the gr-bladerf python binding..
[21:31:38] <warnes[m]> And some google-foo suggests that `hier_block2` may have been renamed `hier_block`...
[21:31:51] <nick40[m]> No, I'm just trying to understand how GNU Radio works
[21:33:13] <nick40[m]> because looking at a python script generated by GNU Radio companion has lots of "from gnuradio import audio" and I would like to know where it searches for those libraries
[21:34:17] <warnes[m]> @nick40, sorry I thought you were responding to my question, 😜
[21:34:44] <warnes[m]> The generated script is python, and it imports python libraries, many of which wrap c++.
[21:35:00] <jholtom> warnes[m]: that is not strictly true
[21:35:08] <jholtom> you can build C++ standalone flowgraphs and programs in GNURadio
[21:35:53] <warnes[m]> jholtom: True, but gnuradio-companion only generates python.
[21:35:57] <warnes[m]> Yes?
[21:36:32] <jholtom> warnes[m]: yes
[21:36:44] <jholtom> https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/issues/2297
[21:36:49] <jholtom> though iirc this is trying to change that
[21:36:55] <drmpeg> No. There's an option for C++.
[21:36:55] <jholtom> so you can actually do c++ generation from GRC
[21:37:03] <jholtom> oh its active now?
[21:37:06] <jholtom> gosh I'm so out of touch with GRC
[21:37:17] <drmpeg> But it's pretty buggy.
[21:37:43] <jholtom> warnes[m]: also I'm pretty sure your bug is gr-bladerf is only setup for gr3.9 and not 3.10
[21:37:46] <warnes[m]> Yes, I just saw that.  I just toggled it, and it gave errors about "This bock does not support C++ output", so it seems to be a work-in-progress.
[21:38:10] <warnes[m]> Did `heir_block2` get renamed in 3.9 -> 3.10?
[21:38:36] <drmpeg> It's one of my pet peeves. It's a poop or get off the pot kind of thing.
[21:39:06] <jholtom> understandably
[21:41:00] <warnes[m]> Is there a porting guide from 3.9 to 3.10?
[21:41:19] <jholtom> warnes[m]: https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/GNU_Radio_3.10_OOT_Module_Porting_Guide
[21:42:01] <warnes[m]> jholtom: Thanks!
