[00:09:25] <aphysically> because it behaves the same as the failing mkv file I feel like it's very likely the reason the ffconcat-fed vf_subtitles fails is it doesn't like the internal-mkv numbering for the subtitles changing when it reaches the next file, I guess?

[03:58:59] <Guest16> Evening ladies & gentlemen. I'm attempting to build a Fragmented MP4 muxer (from scratch) as a learning opportunity. I receive video frames from an existing source and I have some B-frames that have a composition time but no duration. Do all frame types I,B, P need a duration? I presume they do and I need to patch the code that feeds me the frames?
[03:59:42] <BtbN> you don't need a duration at all, and don't usually have one
[03:59:53] <BtbN> it's implicitly given via pts
[04:00:32] <BtbN> no idea how mp4/mov/isosomething handles it internally, but ffmpeg does not normally care about duration all that much
[04:01:17] <Guest16> Yes but B-frames have CTS,  (a composition timestamp) but I assume they also need a PTS?
[04:01:44] <Guest16> There is a field in the TFHD atom box to specify a default duration, which means the demuxer must internally reconstrue the PTS, afaik
[04:02:35] <Guest16> So given that a sample doesn't have a duration/pts specified, it should apply the default duration to calculate the PTS. But I'm starting to think that the demuxer that I'm using to feed my packets is likely buggy.
[04:08:02] <Guest16> The TRUN box allows me to set flags for what the sample contains: sample size, pts, cts etc. But I have set of mixed I, P & B frames and the composition timestamp is only required for B-frames. But the TRUN box flags apply to all entries, so if I set the CTS flag, should I fake a CTS of I & P flags?
[04:09:02] <Guest16> It seems that the behavior of ffmpeg is to set the CTS flag if it detects any b-frames and then leverage the default duration to make sure that any other frames do have a proper PTS
[04:19:26] <BtbN> You have dts and pts
[04:19:43] <BtbN> dts is in the order stuff needs to be decoded in. And pts in order it needs to be presented in.
[04:20:31] <BtbN> Usually muxed packets are just in decode order, and the decoder then reorders the frames into presentation order
[04:22:26] <Guest16> Yes but in the file format supports either: specifying the pts in absolute terms or setting the default duration and it will dynamically calculate the PTS for each frame if no absolute PTS was specified
[04:23:46] <Guest16> The demuxer isn't giving me any info w.r.t the pts, I'm just getting the cts to calculate the dts.
[04:23:55] <Guest16> It's not an ffmpeg demuxer btw
[04:24:19] <Guest16> But thank you, I will take a look at the fixing the demuxer :)

[13:11:47] <pozz> I'm trying to use ffmpeg to receive and save a RTSP/RTP stream from an IPCam. Audio can be enabled from the configuration web page of the CAM. Even if audio is disabled, RTSP DESCRIBE response contains info about an audio stream.
[13:12:21] <pozz> Indeed ffmpeg and ffprobe shows info about an audio stream even if audio is disabled.
[13:13:01] <pozz> I can see no audio frames are really transmitted when audio is disabled. As soon as I enable audio on IPCam, Wireshark shows audio frames as expected.
[13:14:47] <pozz> Unfortunately ffmpeg seems not working well in this scenario, when audio is disabled on CAM, but announced on RTSP. I experienced a very long delay (around 30 seconds) at startup with creation of the output file.
[13:15:29] <pozz> When I stop ffmpeg now, in reality I stopped the stream at a very old time in the past, around 30 seconds ago.
[13:15:53] <pozz> If audio is enabled (and audio frames are present in the stream) ffmpeg seems working well.
[13:16:09] <pozz> Any idea how to solve this?

[18:36:59] <radiomark> I'm trying to implement an automatic two-pass "loudnorm" filter on some audio
[18:37:29] <radiomark> Does ffmpeg have a 'standard' way for doing two pass processes that I am not understanding?
[18:38:21] <radiomark> http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#loudnorm
[18:38:36] <radiomark> Filter can print to JSON but seems to be no way to put that to a file, or read the file

[18:40:32] <JEEB> radiomark: in theory if the filter attached the values either as side data or metadata to the AVFrames you could have it in a nice manner
[18:40:39] <JEEB> but right now I don't see it doing that :<
[18:40:56] <JEEB> then if you had an API client you could do the stuff properly programmatically
[18:41:12] <JEEB> right now with ffmpeg.c you can see under tools/loudnorm.rb
[18:41:14] <radiomark> Yeah I seem to be left with munging the output to extract the values -- right now I can't even work out how to stop sending the JSON to stderr
[18:41:32] <JEEB> that's how someone decided to implement it in ruby

[18:42:49] <JEEB> although I would prefer something that could be nicely utilized through the API :D
[18:43:45] <radiomark> Can you help me understand the ruby example; they are parsing the JSON from stderr?
[18:44:34] <JEEB> that's apparently what it does

[18:51:20] <JEEB> yea it's just messy if a random filter does it

[23:31:39] <Atsuko> hey all, im trying to dump a random frame from a video to work out crop settings before encoding
[23:31:48] <Atsuko> i've always use this line and it's always worked
[23:32:05] <Atsuko> ffmpeg -ss 27 -i input.m2ts -r 1 output.bmp
[23:32:31] <Atsuko> but now it's spitting out this warning
[23:32:34] <Atsuko> "Output file is empty, nothing was encoded (check -ss / -t / -frames parameters if used)"
[23:32:45] <Atsuko> is there somthing im doing wrong, or somthing else i can do
[23:33:01] <JEEB> mpeg-ts is not an indexed container so your seek can end up in varying places as the library attempts to guesstimate things
[23:33:07] <JEEB> so the result will be the same but not even close to exact
[23:33:30] <Atsuko> i see
[23:33:48] <JEEB> I recommend utilizing something like ffms2 to index the input once, and then you can freely traverse it. simplest ways to visually view this is either with vapoursynth or avisynth since those have editors that have live preview
[23:33:56] <JEEB> like vapoursynth editor for vapoursynth
[23:34:14] <JEEB> also since those do cropping as well, you can preview how many samples you have to crop etc
[23:34:23] <AaronBurr> getting a frame for cropping doesn't require an accurate seek position
[23:34:31] <JEEB> sure
[23:34:42] <JEEB> but since mpeg-ts is not indexed, that 27 second seek can end up anywhere
[23:34:50] <AaronBurr> ah ty
[23:34:50] <JEEB> in this case it decided it couldn't decode anything
[23:35:06] <JEEB> I mean, the result is the same for the same value of ss, but it can end up *somewhere*
[23:35:13] <AaronBurr> thanks for clearing me up
[23:35:25] <JEEB> depending on where the random access points are and where libavformat guesstimates it should seek
[23:35:43] <JEEB> so if it happens to seek to after your last random access point -> no output for you
[23:35:46] <JEEB> since you went past
[23:36:00] <Atsuko> thx JEEB
[23:36:07] <AaronBurr> Atsuko: maybe autocrop filter?
[23:36:18] <Atsuko> no i like to manually check a frame
