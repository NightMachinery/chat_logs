[04:12:11] <aplund> flatcap: thanks!
[04:12:38] <flatcap> sorry about that
[04:12:49] <aplund> flatcap: this seems to fix my new/old maildir problem with notmuch virtual folders: https://gist.github.com/aplund/294ca32f4b03fffa0b1119ded08fc706
[04:13:25] <aplund> I'm just not sure if it is the right approach.  Shouldn't maildir_parse_flags set the 'old' variable?
[04:13:41] <aplund> the code doesn't seem to check if the message is in new or cur at all.
[04:14:04] <bremner> isn't that the definition of old?
[04:14:06] * flatcap pokes adray
[04:14:20] <bremner> (which is btw (neo)mutt specific)
[04:16:53] *** Joins: capn (~capn@user/capn)
[04:17:11] <aplund> bremner: that's why I believe the maildir_parse_flags function in maildir/maildir.c should probably be updated and not the code in the neomutt bindings.
[04:20:59] <flatcap> your patch seems reasonable.  please can you create a pull-request for it, so I can discuss the details with adray (neomutt's notmuch guy)
[04:21:50] <aplund> flatcap... ok.   There's some other issues with the 'unread' label in notmuch... but this solves the randomness in the index.

[16:40:41] *** Joins: nyah (~nyah@05453449.skybroadband.com)
[16:47:20] <gahr> wow that's quite some code!
[16:48:43] <gahr> do you think ansi_color_parse_single could use some regexp? :)
[16:50:00] <flatcap> hehe
[16:50:04] <flatcap> yes, very probably
[16:50:22] <flatcap> feel free to improve it :-)
[16:52:55] <flatcap> we sort of accept true colour ANSI sequences, but we can't do anything with them yet
[16:53:40] <flatcap> I've done some experiments with ncurses and true colour and it seems that we're limited to a 256 colour palette
[16:53:57] <flatcap> we can have 256^2 pairs, but only 256 distinct colours
[16:54:28] <gahr> I'm not even sure *I* can see more than 255 colors :)
[16:54:50] <flatcap> :-)
[16:55:17] <flatcap> I'm going to add some screenshots, but...
[16:55:47] <flatcap> you can test the code against the "colour" dir in the sample-mail repo - https://github.com/neomutt/sample-mail
[16:56:16] <flatcap> there's a colour-cube and a lolcat to really thrash the ansi code
[16:57:12] <gahr> haha nice
[16:57:18] <flatcap> the :color command will show all the colours in use
[17:05:21] <flatcap> I'd appreciate your opinion on #3250 and #3251...

[17:05:29] <flatcap> good ideas? or a step too far?
[17:06:18] <flatcap> the first separates the Envelope out of Compose -- a separate self-contained library
[17:07:20] <flatcap> the second, creates a global dispatch handler, OP_VERSION, etc
[17:08:04] <flatcap> but it moves the dispatcher into MuttWindow -- function handling becomes part of the window
[17:10:28] <flatcap> in that PR, you can window_dispatch_function(focused_window, op) and you don't have to know who can handle it

[17:22:59] <gahr> I think intuitively I would start the search at the root, always
[17:23:11] <gahr> which kind of means a global event loop
[17:23:16] <gahr> and unique OP_
[17:23:23] *** Joins: todd (~todd@gateway/tor-sasl/toddf)
[17:23:45] <gahr> so you wouldn't have OP_DOWN that depends on whether you're in the index or the pager
[17:23:59] <gahr> "This would allow multiple dispatchers to support the same OP -- the first visible one would win.
[17:24:07] <gahr> as opposed to this
[17:24:24] <gahr> I'm not sure "first visible" always matches the traversal of the tree
[17:24:29] <gahr> depending on where you are
[17:25:08] *** Joins: gabriel1 (~gabriel1@user/gabriel1)
[17:25:14] <gahr> so if you are in the pager and have pager_index_lines, and you have a DOWN function that both the index and the sidebar can handle, how do you dispatch it?
[17:25:27] <gahr> should it work differently if you set pager_index_lines=0?
[17:27:39] <flatcap> I'd like unique OPs but my first attempt to rename things didn't end well
[17:27:59] <gahr> yeah
[17:28:01] <flatcap> so currently we need to start at the focused window
[17:28:23] <flatcap> I'm not sure about hidden windows
[17:29:27] <flatcap> if the OPs are unique, then hidden windows should be tested and accept the OP with no action
[17:30:31] <gahr> if the OPs are unique, I think hidden windows should accept the OP and do the action
[17:30:43] <gahr> I might want to select a different sidebar folder even if the sidebar isn't visible
[17:30:58] <gahr> not sure why, but I don't think an error or a silent no-op would be equally valid
[17:31:06] <flatcap> hmm... the sidebar functions are disabled if it's not visible
[17:31:53] <flatcap> if you allow sidebar-next, without the visual feedback, then sidebar-open won't be predictable
[17:33:40] <flatcap> hmm... it might depend on the window...
[17:34:09] <flatcap> in the Pager, you can next-entry to the next email, even if pager_index_lines=0
[17:35:18] <gahr> yeah

[17:36:01] <gahr> you might end up dispatching to a different window depending on who's visible
[17:36:10] <flatcap> yes
[17:37:14] <flatcap> top-down: the index will be searched before the pager (as it's geographically above it)
[17:38:39] *** Quits: gabriel1 (~gabriel1@user/gabriel1) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[17:39:38] <flatcap> if that's the goal: top-down, uniq ops... how do we get there?
[17:40:39] <gahr> what was the problem when you tried?
[17:40:52] <flatcap> the generic menu really messed me up...
[17:40:59] <gahr> ah yeah the generic
[17:41:17] <flatcap> it's got lots of functions that have namesakes in Pager, Index,etc
[17:41:19] <gahr> so you can OP_DOWN or something from anywhere
[17:41:24] <flatcap> yeah
[17:41:46] <gahr> removing it would mean duplicate+rename the functions in the specific places where it makes sense
[17:41:49] <gahr> + change the bindings
[17:41:54] <flatcap> yes
[17:42:06] <flatcap> whilst magically being backwards-compatible :-)
[17:42:09] <gahr> but people probably have bindings with the generic functions already
[17:42:13] <gahr> yeah
[17:42:27] <flatcap> well... you say that
[17:42:38] <gahr> so we first identify the problematic functions, add unique versions that do the same thing, and warn on the use of the old ones
[17:42:38] <flatcap> I doubt many people actually:  bind generic ...
[17:42:58] <gahr> ok if we don't care about backwards compatibility it's easier :)
[17:43:10] <gahr> but isn't it the issue that I can bind index OP_FOO when OP_FOO is generic>?
[17:43:39] <gahr> so if index gets OP_FOO_INDEX and pager gets OP_FOO_PAGER, bind index OP_FOO needs to go away
[17:43:56] <flatcap> yes
[17:44:35] <flatcap> I thought of something, whilst breaking up functions...
[17:44:45] <flatcap> that we nearly have a "sidebar" menu
[17:45:21] <flatcap> instead of  bind index,pager Ctrl-O  sidebar-open,  we'd have   bind sidebar Ctrl-O sidebar-open
[17:47:43] <flatcap> separating index from pager, we might have:
[17:47:45] <flatcap> bind index J next-entry
[17:48:14] <flatcap> urgh, no
[17:48:37] <flatcap> how would users know what bindings would work in the index, which in the pager and which in both?
[17:49:13] <flatcap> do we need to kill the "menu" part of bindings completely?
[17:49:30] <flatcap> bind J index-next-entry
[17:49:41] <gahr> yeah
[17:49:52] <gahr> if we have unique functions, yeah
[17:50:10] <gahr> no wait
[17:50:16] <flatcap> if I type 'J' in the Pager...
[17:50:20] <gahr> yeah
[17:50:30] <gahr> it's not about the "menu", it's about where you are when you trigger the key
[17:50:37] <gahr> that's what users care about
[17:50:47] <flatcap> yes
[17:50:50] <gahr> bind index J index-next-entry; bind pager J pager-half-down
[17:50:52] <gahr> or something
[17:51:09] <flatcap> which depends on the focus
[17:51:30] <gahr> yes
[17:51:31] <flatcap> oh, another problem of top-down, and hidden windows.  what about mulitiple indexes
[17:51:43] <flatcap> in the index -> compose -> (attach) index
[17:52:14] *** Quits: gabriel1_ (~gabriel1@pop.92-184-110-46.mobile.abo.orange.fr) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:52:29] <flatcap> we'd need to distinguish between hidden and a-completely-separate-set-of-windows
[17:52:57] <gahr> try focussed first, then top down?
[17:53:51] *** Joins: gabriel1 (~gabriel1@user/gabriel1)
[17:54:06] <flatcap> hmm... the pager and index are cousins, so we'd need to climb the tree a little
[17:54:20] <flatcap> the sidebar is a distant cousin (a little further up the tree)
[17:56:04] <gahr> why do we need a tree?
[17:56:15] <gahr> I mean, to walk...
[17:56:37] <gahr> wait, let me gather my ideas 20 more sec :)
[17:56:45] <flatcap> np :-)
[17:57:52] <gahr> so if you have index -> pager -> compose -> (attach) index
[17:58:15] <flatcap> there are multiple dialogs in the all-dialogs(A) window
[17:58:31] <flatcap> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neomutt/gfx/main/screenshots/window/dlg-index-pager-sidebar.svg
[17:58:43] <gahr> yep looking at that :)
[17:59:01] <flatcap> (I pity anyone else trying to follow this conversation :-)
[17:59:08] <gahr> s/else//
[17:59:14] <flatcap> hehe
[18:00:25] <flatcap> in the index->compose->index case, there are three dialogs -- in the order they were created
[18:00:35] <gahr> ok
[18:00:39] <gahr> let's assume we have unique functions
[18:00:44] <flatcap> yep
[18:00:45] <gahr> so index-next vs pager-next
[18:01:10] <gahr> so index-next in this case obviously refers to the attach index
[18:01:25] <gahr> so looking into the currently focussed menu makes sense
[18:01:26] <flatcap> yes.  that'll have the focus
[18:01:31] <gahr> good
[18:01:38] <gahr> what if you pager-down
[18:02:01] <gahr> we can do as you say, no-op if no focussed window can handle it
[18:02:11] <gahr> and that's reasonable
[18:02:19] <gahr> it can be defended :)
[18:02:32] <flatcap> :-)
[18:02:57] <gahr> index-next when you're in the pager and have or not have pager_index_lines 
[18:02:59] <flatcap> because there are no pagers visible, nothing would accept pager-down
[18:03:01] <gahr> can be solved by introducing a pager-next
[18:03:19] <gahr> so you are free to use index-next as long as you have an index visible
[18:03:29] <gahr> or you can always use pager-next when you're in the pager
[18:04:10] <flatcap> so you'd duplicate lots of index functions but with s/index/pager/
[18:04:18] <flatcap> and the sidebar too?
[18:04:38] <gahr> sidebar we can choose whether you can only operate it when it's visible
[18:04:53] <gahr> pager-next is important because it affects the pager
[18:05:01] <gahr> and you want to be able to do it even without pager_index_lines
[18:05:19] <gahr> alternatively
[18:05:30] <flatcap> yeah, the pager *needs* to know about the index, but not the sidebar
[18:05:33] <gahr> we still try the focussed thingie first
[18:05:57] <gahr> then we walk the whole tree, and if there are more than one menu that can accept the op, we warn "dunno"

[18:20:49] <flatcap> if you <help> in the pager, which bindings would you see?
[18:22:12] <flatcap> we almost want to ask all the windows, so the help would say (in order)
[18:22:15] <flatcap> Pager bindings...
[18:22:20] <flatcap> Index bindings...
[18:22:23] <flatcap> Sidebar bindings
[18:22:27] <flatcap> Global bindings

[18:29:56] <gahr> mh
[18:30:04] <gahr> yeah we can report all the bindings
[18:30:16] <gahr> sorry meeting :/
[18:30:21] <flatcap> np
[18:30:47] <flatcap> I'm still not sure about top-down, though
[18:31:10] <flatcap> climbing upwards would list the bindings in a relevance order
[18:34:21] <flatcap> hmm... here's an idea that's unlikely to work...
[18:34:29] <flatcap> index-only binding
[18:34:48] <flatcap> bind index J next-entry # available in pager too
[18:35:03] <flatcap> bind index-only J next-entry # NOT available in pager
[18:35:41] <flatcap> or perhaps we want all of the index's bindings to bleed through into the pager
[18:38:02] <flatcap> actually, the index will know whether it's focussed or not
[18:38:48] <flatcap> which index functions (if any) are NOT available in the pager?
[18:54:30] <gahr> good question
[18:54:36] <gahr> limit?
[18:54:55] <gahr> well, since you can always see the index with pager_index_lines, I can't think of anything..
[18:55:17] <gahr> are you suggesting that the pager functions are a superset of the index functions?
[18:55:21] <gahr> logically
[18:55:24] <flatcap> I think so
[18:55:41] <flatcap> there aren't _that_ many just-pager functions
