[00:12:08] <PapuaHardyNet> oooh, okay. I thought you regularly sleep very late and still have no work related issues
[00:12:44] <PapuaHardyNet> shawwwn: you might like reading Yud's newer stuff
[00:13:02] <PapuaHardyNet> specifically his Inadequate Equilibria, it is much higher quality writing in comparison to the sequences
[00:13:21] <nshepperd> nah his newer stuff sucks
[00:13:23] <PapuaHardyNet> He also wrote light novel erotica, if you are into that sort of thing
[00:14:23] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd: imo his older stuff was consistently lower quality. Lots of meandering blogposts that weren't easily connected to a coherent whole
[00:14:31] <shawwwn> finally, a personal anecdote https://www.readthesequences.com/Your-Strength-As-A-Rationalist
[00:14:53] <feep> the sequences have lots of personal anecdotes...
[00:15:16] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: I tend to super disagree, I think even and specifically the quantum physics sequence is actually super important
[00:15:57] <feep> it's just that eliezer never explicitly explains anywhere why he wrote that, which I firmly believe is "as a cornerstone in my 100-post argument for why you should SIGN UP FOR CRYO ALREADY DAMMIT"
[00:16:33] <feep> (the qm sequence seems to be what lots of people refer to when they call a post unimportant)
[00:17:17] <feep> I can only say ... like, the fact that atoms don't have identity has been a beautiful shortcut that has helped my ontology of self out *immensely* over the years, and though I believe it's not necessary for my current position to be stable, it has been immensely valuable in cutting my old position to shreds, which was vital
[00:18:45] <feep> I think afaict, most lw posts do form a coherent whole, it's just not always obvious which way it shapes up
[00:19:03] <PapuaHardyNet> there are diamonds in this heap of blog posts, yes
[00:19:11] <feep> no it's not like diamonds, it's more like proteins
[00:19:24] <PapuaHardyNet> no
[00:19:32] <PapuaHardyNet> diamonds >:|
[00:19:43] <feep> if you're seeing diamonds, you're seeing the carrier, the payload is the ideas that eating the diamonds injects into your brain, which then self-assemble into rudimentary sanity

[00:20:14] <PapuaHardyNet> you know, it's been a really long time since I first read the sequences. At least half a decade
[00:20:50] <feep> shawwwn: yes that's important but yes, the explanation is cruddy
[00:20:57] <PapuaHardyNet> I can't really debate the specifics of the sequences with you. However, I do agree with your assertion
[00:21:12] <nshepperd> shawwwn: it's quite simple. perhaps you're not taking enough drugs
[00:21:22] <shawwwn> ah, true
[00:21:24] <feep> shawwwn: eliezer made several tries to get conservation of evidence into an intuitively parseable format, and I think they all were sort of eh

[00:26:31] <feep> dark thought: anti-aging pre-singularity is a pointless field because most anti-aging treatments will do nothing, each individual breakthrough knocks out a few years in isolation and it's only the combination of half a dozen interventions that results in thousand-year lifespans

I could only say, "we need people committed to progress because of the good probability AGI just won't happen" which is not terribly inspiring
[00:28:16] <nshepperd> no, this is a dark thought: anti-aging pre-singularity is pointless because the people who don't survive to the launch of AGI will be the lucky ones
[00:28:17] <PapuaHardyNet> feep, what's your most probable timeline for AGI / singularity?
[00:28:29] <feep> positive or negative?
[00:28:29] <shawwwn> what even is this webpage tho. https://www.readthesequences.com/Guessing-The-Teachers-Password
[00:28:37] <shawwwn> "When I was young, I read popular physics books such as Richard Feynman’s QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter."
[00:28:45] <shawwwn> the word "strange" links to https://www.readthesequences.com/Think-Like-Reality
[00:28:52] <feep> yes?
[00:28:55] <feep> that seems straightforward
[00:28:59] <PapuaHardyNet> shawwwn: guessing the teacher's password was the most influential Yudkowsky post I read
[00:29:15] <feep> shawwwn: this will make more sense if you imagine it like tvtropes
[00:29:16] <shawwwn> why would it make sense to link "strange" to that page? it's a part of a book title

[00:29:25] <gwern> it's commentary
[00:29:26] <feep> shawwwn: no it does actually make sense there
[00:29:35] <feep> his link placements generally makes sense

[00:29:50] <shawwwn> is it actually elizer's, or did this webpage take certain liberties?
[00:29:59] <feep> ... is what eliezer's?
[00:29:59] <gwern> I'm sure it's eliezer's
[00:30:01] <feep> the word "strange"?
[00:30:03] <shawwwn> the link
[00:30:05] <nshepperd> it's commentary on the use of the word 'strange' in that book title
[00:30:05] <feep> uh
[00:30:07] <PapuaHardyNet> eliezer runs readthesequences.com?
[00:30:08] <feep> how do you own a link
[00:30:19] <feep> the posts? yeah they're approximately all him
[00:30:30] <gwern> feep: oh, you put it in a nft
[00:30:31] <feep> dude was prolific and derivative
[00:30:36] <shawwwn> I didn't realize this site was eliezer's.
[00:30:38] <feep> which is always a recipe for volume
[00:30:52] <gwern> shawwwn: it's obormot's re-presentation of the original LW posts
[00:31:11] <shawwwn> yes. that's why I was skeptical that that link was actually created by eleiieiezer
[00:31:14] <feep> the link was.
[00:31:17] <PapuaHardyNet> so obormot owns the site
[00:31:17] <shawwwn> and not some obormot harebrained idea
[00:31:20] <gwern> why would obormot do that?
[00:31:32] <shawwwn> because obormot does a lot of dumb shit, and no one seems to recognize or disagree with him when he does it
[00:31:34] <gwern> he's retypsetting it, not editing it
[00:31:39] <feep> like, not only would obormot not do that, but it makes perfect sense that yudkowsky would
[00:32:14] <shawwwn> yeah, I agree it makes sense. I was just surprised.
[00:32:21] <feep> if you know the post referenced, and the sequence in which it appears, placing the reference on "strange" is completely straightforward
[00:32:22] <shawwwn> (I agree now, I mean.)
[00:32:41] <feep> (if not, well, there's ... a link ^^)
[00:33:35] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: anyway, I'm kind of hyper vaguely sitting at 2040 rn, but
[00:34:05] <feep> there's some things I'm really paying attention to, the two chart leaders are multi-scale learning, ie. some gradient between short-term and long-term knowledge storage
[00:34:25] <feep> and learned world model tree search

[00:37:15] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: to clarify, that's for the UFAI/"FAI because, not despite, horrible mess" outcome
[00:37:17] <PapuaHardyNet> sorry, I completely forgot the topic
[00:37:19] <feep> I have no timeline for the FAI outcome.
[00:37:28] <feep> I cannot even visualize a path that would get there.
[00:37:46] <feep> it's like
[00:37:53] <feep> "presumably, something happens -- and then principled FAI."
[00:38:21] <PapuaHardyNet> I see
[00:38:45] <PapuaHardyNet> why learned world model tree search?

[00:39:03] <shawwwn> at this point I think apple just hates scrollbars
[00:39:06] <feep> because that's where ... if I look at how current game players fail to play with games that come closer to the real world

[00:41:51] <feep> an AI that can always keep learning can be reactive in a way that current systems fundamentally are not
[00:42:30] <feep> as well as, of course, its ability to find unexpected training sets in the wild

[01:15:28] <shawwwn> good question
[01:15:55] <shawwwn> you seem to have irc log fu. happen to be able to dig up that reddit comment?

[01:19:45] <gwern> 'Instead of training two different models, or fine-tuning a trained model on the "better" games, I simply added two new tokens to the vocabulary, A, and B, and prefaced each game with one of the two tokens. A was used for the more stringent filter, and B for the rest. I did this primarily to save time. Note that it's fairly trivial to "undo" this conditioning just by summing over the two...
[01:19:51] <gwern> ...possible first tokens. I was hoping strategy this would allow me to train with a massive dataset, but then to condition on A to generate higher quality games. ... Each sequence ends with an additional token to denote which side won, or a draw.' nope
[01:21:27] <gwern> so that's an interesting example. ricsonc *was* concerned about how you sample from 'good' play, but did that ad hoc split filtering thing and just dumping the reward at the end, never realizing it could be put at the front along with ELO skill metadata to do it

[01:50:02] * shawwwn downgrades the mention to "something sort of similar"
[01:50:10] <gwern> he's interesting as an example of how natural it is to *not* do it DT
[01:50:53] <gwern> he has all the pieces, he's explicitly thinking 'how do I get GPT to generate *good* games?', he's putting metadata inline as the obvious thing to do, and then he misses the key step of sticking the reward at the beginning

[01:53:01] <gwern> well, by the same logic, they probably did all their work before 5 december 2019 too...

[02:47:25] <RiversHaveWings> yeah but is the xla support still bad
[02:48:08] <shawwwn> not as far as I can tell... my core issue with the previous XLA was that e.g. dataloader was running on your local VM, not on the TPU
[02:48:15] <RiversHaveWings> oh
[02:48:22] <shawwwn> so if you wanted to train on imagenet, every training example had to be uploaded "on demand"
[02:48:26] <shawwwn> from your GCP VM up to the TPU
[02:49:10] <shawwwn> another way of putting it: you couldn't allocate tensors in a way that used TPU RAM. And TPUs have 330GB of RAM
[02:49:30] <shawwwn> but now you can just do torch.rand(3,3) and it uses TPU RAM by default
[02:49:49] <shawwwn> torch.rand(3,3, device=tpu) makes it allocate on the TPU core memory

[03:39:34] <quanticle> gwern: Yeah, you'd need a decent amount of initial capital (but not an obsene amount -- a few million should do the trick) and you'd need to set up the storage space correctly.
[03:39:59] <quanticle> No use buying all this stuff and then just storing it in a giant pile of cardboard boxes in a Self Store somewhere.
[03:40:16] <gwern> really, the major cost imo would be just the labor of having people go compile & go through lists of streamers and do all the back and forth of logistics and one-off purchases

[03:41:46] <gwern> well, the nice thing about hedge funds is that they'd barbecue their grandmother at the block party if they thought it had an uncorrelated return
[03:42:12] <gwern> it looking weird as the primary objection is a point in its favor as it explains why no one has or is doing it
[03:42:13] <quanticle> Still, I can imagine the pitch deck for this one
[03:42:18] <Jayson_Virissimo> But most weird-looking things aren't profitable.
[03:42:42] <gwern> but there's typically a better reason than 'it looks weird' to justify the claim 'it's not profitable'

[03:44:05] <quanticle> I think there's profit here, but I'm not sure that your typical finance of Silicon Valley type is going to be interested in this. "Do things that don't scale" is great advice when you're starting out, but at some point you need to figure out how to make it scale.
[03:44:43] <quanticle> I do wonder if the storage costs would eat up all your expected profit.
[03:44:56] <shawwwn> RiversHaveWings: oh, it un-hung
[03:45:00] <RiversHaveWings> oh?
[03:45:06] <gwern> I'm not sure how far this needs to scale. I mean, how big is the hollywood memorabilia market, for comparison?
[03:45:52] <gwern> quanticle: storage costs will eat up as much money as you want to let them. you can have archival museum stuff which costs $1000/year, or you can dump it in the back of a U-Store for a few bucks a year amortized

[03:54:58] <shawwwn> it must be something further ahead

[03:56:57] <shawwwn> clip does work

[03:57:19] <RiversHaveWings> yep
[03:57:20] <shawwwn> I bet args.cutn == 64 is the problem here
[03:57:43] <RiversHaveWings> btw, MakeCutouts makes 64 random crops of the image and resizes them
[03:57:50] <RiversHaveWings> i.e. not a static graph
[03:58:28] <shawwwn> odd
[03:58:32] <RiversHaveWings> then it has to backprop through it
[03:58:47] <RiversHaveWings> uh, is it actually executing those graphs
[03:58:58] <RiversHaveWings> like view iii
[03:59:20] <shawwwn> .
[03:59:26] <shawwwn> I'm reluctant to view tensors since it causes tensors to transfer from TPU memory
[03:59:33] <RiversHaveWings> oh
[03:59:37] <RiversHaveWings> well
[03:59:39] <shawwwn> lel
[03:59:44] <RiversHaveWings> that's the problem
[03:59:52] <shawwwn> possibly
[03:59:55] <RiversHaveWings> it builds up the graph and then hangs when it compiles it
[04:00:08] <RiversHaveWings> i.e. when you do a transfer back or do the optimizer step with barrier thing
[04:00:12] <shawwwn> all we know at the moment is that it's slow to transfer memory from TPU core to host
[04:00:24] <shawwwn> but I don't think the backprop would do that each step
[04:00:29] <RiversHaveWings> you can just force it t ocompile and execute the graph without a transfer back
[04:00:30] <RiversHaveWings> right
[04:01:29] <RiversHaveWings> ok so you got a loss
[04:01:31] <RiversHaveWings> try backwarding it

[04:23:32] <gwern> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_memorabilia#1970_MGM_auction what a haul
[04:23:32] <Robomot> Film memorabilia - Wikipedia [1970 MGM auction] (Film memorabilia are objects considered of value because of their connection to the cinema. These include costumes, props, advertising posters, and scripts, among other things. …)
[04:23:57] <gwern> can you imagine how much the contents of those 7 soundstages would be worth today? I mean, just the ruby slippers alone would be equivalent to the total revenue of that auction back in 1970
[04:26:28] <gwern> let's see, debbie reynolds purchased a few thousand items, and her collection went for $22m, $2m, and an unknown amount in 3 auctions back in like 2011
[04:30:09] <gwern> 'The months before the Manhattan opening were a frenzy. Evan Todd, an assistant working with Barish who had no curation experience, was brought in to collect props and costumes to decorate the restaurants. Today, movie memorabilia is close to art—auctioned at prestigious houses like Christie’s. But for decades, movie props were thrown out after filming, grabbed by whoever wanted to take...
[04:30:15] <gwern> ...them home, or repurposed by the art department for another shoot, leaving them unrecognizable. In the late eighties, people were just starting to pay attention to set castoffs after a pair of ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz sold in 1988 for $165,000. Todd went to the studios to ask for donations—some would only lend items, demanding the right to get them back whenever they wanted....
[04:30:21] <gwern> ...And he bought items that went up for auction, bidding against private collectors. He dug around in musty attics, damp garages, secondhand shops. He found the ships from Ben-Hur in the middle of a Nebraska cornfield. The ax Jack Nicholson wielded in The Shining, still caked in fake blood, was buried in the back of the garden shed of a guy who worked on the film. “We asked what he wanted...
[04:30:27] <gwern> ...for it,” Todd told the Los Angeles Times in 1995, “and he said, ‘Well, I’ll need another ax.’ That was an easy deal.”'
[04:32:39] <adiabatty> ggreer: it kind of sounds interesting judging by the cover, but I hear the author gets super preachy
[04:32:58] <ggreer> I pirated the ebook. it's... absurd

[04:34:47] <Ralith> absurd?
[04:35:33] <pie__bnc> Dev tools have made a lot of progress but it's pretty frustrating that I can only view the box model of one element at a time...
[04:35:43] <pie__bnc> also are there no good books for learning HTML/CSS? 
[04:35:49] <pie__bnc> Im basically just jumping all over MDN
[04:36:19] <pie__bnc> which is fine for me, but I would have like to recommend something actually good to the friend that got me sidetracked poking at webshit..
[04:36:47] <Betawolf> recommend they stay out of webdev?
[04:36:51] <pie__bnc> and anything for doing layout? doing it by hand seems pretty tedious
[04:36:55] <pie__bnc> Betawolf: heh
[04:37:31] <pie__bnc> someone has to take all the money
[04:39:11] <ggreer> I knew the hugos were going downhill but I didn't know they gave awards to shitty propaganda
[04:41:10] <Betawolf> what's wrong with it? It sounds like a typical naval-gazing 'look how the earth was destroyed' with mutants and spaceships, pretty common in scifi.
[04:42:05] <ggreer> the idea is that if we get rid of all the white male libertarians and adopt genderfluid borderless communism, the earth would become a utopia 
[04:42:31] <Betawolf> lol
[04:43:16] <Jayson_Virissimo> Okay, but the previous communist experiments had hard borders (including between sex categories), so who knows, maybe this time...

[04:49:03] <RiversHaveWings> shawwwn: np :)
[04:50:48] <gwern> I have to say, none of that sounds particularly libetarian. it sounds more... authoritarian? like, the exact opposite of libertarianism?

[09:32:44] <Logos01> Obormot\Gaia: Well. Yeah I'm sure they would *say* it was political. But they would also believe that there's no such thing as something that isn't.
[09:33:16] <Logos01> But they would *also* say that it is as close to objectively morally correct as it's possible to be.
[09:33:29] <Logos01> "Because it's just right."
[09:33:51] <Logos01> ... okay, moment of bitterness arising here so I'mma just say this and recuse myself.
[09:34:13] <Logos01> This is *VERY* similar to what happens whenever I talk about domestic abuse in any public forum.
[09:34:37] <Logos01> Some woman -- and it's almost always a woman, and if it isn't it's an open intersectional feminist -- tells me "This ia chance for you to listen and learn."
[09:34:55] <Logos01> Which lasts right up until I mention what I've lived through.
[09:35:26] <Logos01> They view their position as inherently correct and obviously valid that domestic abuse is a "Women's issue" and men should have no more voice in it than they should about abortion law.
[09:35:40] <Logos01> "This is a chance for you to learn to empathize"
[09:35:54] <Logos01> And then when I point out that I don't fucking *NEED* to empathize to know exactly what it's like because I've lived it?
[09:35:57] <Logos01> FUCKING. CRICKETS.
[09:35:59] * Logos01 done.
[09:36:35] <feep[work]> righteousness is a hell of a drug, man.
[09:37:02] <feep[work]> you're harshing their buzz. of course there's crickets.
[09:37:45] <Logos01> feep[work]: Yeah... the thing that really angers me about it isn't that they don't respond once I drop that little bomb.
[09:38:01] <feep[work]> even that aside, you're just too far offscript.
[09:38:07] <Logos01> It's that I have nigh absolute moral certainty that nothing I can ever say even in those moments will ever budge them even a femtometer from their behavior.
[09:38:21] <saturn2> you know, there's a philosophy that allows you as a white man to experience that same pleasure

[09:39:56] <feep[work]> you were intended to be a prop in their therapy.
[09:40:03] <Logos01> Not gonna lie, the *only* reason I'm more comfortable with Nazi Play in fetish culture than race play in fetish culture is because Hugo Boss was a Bausse.
[09:40:30] <Logos01> feep[work]: No, it's not about their therapy. It's about their underlying narrative.
[09:40:43] <feep[work]> I really don't think it's even about narrative.
[09:40:53] <feep[work]> it's just ritual
[09:40:54] <Logos01> It's a topic that allows them to justify declaring "patriarchical guilt"
[09:41:14] <Logos01> Hence the "This is a time for you to listen and learn (and empathize)"
[09:41:47] <feep[work]> I don't think that means anything
[09:41:48] <Logos01> Because that puts them in the position of shaming the person who is still "mired in the patriarchical ideology"
[09:42:00] <Logos01> feep[work]: I've had that exact phrase said to me five times in the last year.
[09:42:04] <feep[work]> it's just a chant, it's supposed to put you in position to perform your role in the proceedings.
[09:42:07] <feep[work]> yes.
[09:42:25] <Logos01> It *does* mean something, but nobody would ever say it aloud this way.
[09:42:32] <Logos01> "You do not have a voice in this topic. You are to be silent."
[09:42:35] <feep[work]> okay, let me rephrase
[09:42:39] <feep[work]> everything means something
[09:42:47] <feep[work]> I'm saying it's not communicative in nature
[09:43:08] <feep[work]> it's not supposed to inform you that you can gain value from listening
[09:43:12] <Logos01> feep[work]: It's coded, sure.
[09:43:16] <feep[work]> it's not even!
[09:43:19] <Logos01> But intersectional feminists only ever speak in code.
[09:43:41] <feep[work]> like, it's not code as in crypto, it's code as in computer.
[09:43:48] <Logos01> Well, that's not accurate.  They only ever disseminate coded expressions.
[09:44:03] <feep[work]> ritual language always is code.
[09:44:05] <Logos01> It's structurally rather than informationally coded, yes.
[09:44:08] <feep[work]> yeah
[09:44:10] <Logos01> Yeah.
[09:44:21] <Logos01> There are things you're supposed to say to obtain a certain response.
[09:44:24] <feep[work]> exactly.
[09:44:34] <feep[work]> and then the responses assemble the ritual.
[09:44:58] <Logos01> Or more importantly to demonstrate your piety to the aligned elements.
[09:45:08] <feep[work]> you're offscript like the athame at an animal sacrifice suddenly starting to talk about the morality of substitutive punishment

[10:27:51] <feep[work]> is, as far as I can tell from limited experimentation, just straight up a different person than regular me.
[10:27:53] <quanticle> Speaking of which, I've been vaccinated for like 3 months now, and I have NO 5G WHATSOEVER
[10:28:02] <quanticle> This is a scam, I tell ya!

[10:29:23] <feep[work]> quanticle: so I think it's really ... like, agp is just a too reductivist description of what's going on here.
[10:29:44] <feep[work]> it's not even like, I kink on the idea of me as a woman, it's, I kink on the me that *is* a woman, which is a different *entity* from me.
[10:29:56] <feep[work]> hence, depersonalization.
[10:30:16] <quanticle> Or at least that's what it was advertised. I have no 5G whatsoever, and I feel like instead of being injected with nanobots that turn me into a 5G modem and upgrade my technology to be 5G compatible, I might have been injected with something really lame, like a vaccine for coronavirus.
[10:30:35] <feep[work]> and I don't *want* to be her either, that's the thing, catgirls are support builds and I'm a main. I want to *contain* her.

[10:31:35] <feep[work]> but then in a sexual context, it's like the sign flips?
[10:32:04] <feep[work]> and suddenly the intuitive, preferable perspective of the pair is the other half
[10:32:15] <feep[work]> I mean, that's not agp is it. I have no idea what that is.
[10:32:43] <feep[work]> man. I don't even. All I know is the singularity is going to be fucking *wild* for gender.
[10:33:02] <nshepperd2> '<feep[work]> is, as far as I can tell from limited experimentation, just straight up a different person than regular me.' fyi a lot of trans people have this experience, in the sense that their 'regular' self is a contruct made of repression of all other-gender things in order to hide/fit in
[10:33:07] <nshepperd2> as for the rest of it i dunno
[10:33:28] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: yeah you know that's still very plausible.
[10:33:45] <feep[work]> but like, at a certain sufficient level of repression, it still becomes a valid person who deserves to exist.

[10:42:52] <Nivim> I completely reject any sexuality inflicted on me by my body, so I have difficulty sympathizing, but I can, however, empathize; in my reflexive efforts to psychologically twist any potentional developing kink into a shape that fails to trigger at all, I've learned about a lot of different kinks those brain functions try to form, and I think I know the one you're talking about.
[10:43:18] <feep[work]> ~
[10:43:45] <capisce> kuudes: looks like 22 infected out of 10000 people in Estonia atm
[10:43:58] <feep[work]> I guess the reason why I've always found lw to be pretty agp-accepting is that we're allllll so incredibly weird
[10:43:58] <Nivim> It's basically one that tried to attack of deciding "well, since your normal identity refuses to ever have sex, you can swap with this one which is completely free of that restriction", although that's a miserable attack for me, I can imagine someone actually being happy and healthy with it.
[10:44:16] <Nivim> s/tried to at/tried the at/
[10:44:18] <feep[work]> Nivim: yes exactly!
[10:44:21] <feep[work]> Nivim: that fits perfectly
[10:44:35] <Nivim> You're welcome.
[10:44:46] <feep[work]> Nivim: I sort of think of it as due to repression I've transferred all my sexual self-acceptance to my anima
[10:45:24] <feep[work]> which, I think... no, I think that's just a complete description. that's the entire thing.
[10:45:45] <feep[work]> now it just needs a name.
[10:45:49] <feep[work]> schizogender?
[10:46:44] <feep[work]> "dissociative gender disorder" has almost no google hits :/
[10:47:08] <Nivim> (I think it gets healthier the more your idea of that alternative identify could function as a complete person, given the opportunity; the flatter and simpler it is, so long as you let it persist at all, the lower quality the reflections and echoes it causes on the rest of your mind.)
[10:47:18] <feep[work]> yeah
[10:47:28] <nshepperd2> Nivim: you're in a war with your own brain over sex?
[10:47:31] <feep[work]> oh no it could function, p sure
[10:47:49] <feep[work]> not ... like, it wouldn't be well *adjusted* to today's society
[10:48:09] <feep[work]> but that's okay cause I won't be able to do anything about this until the singularity anyway
[10:48:17] <feep[work]> ^^
[10:48:25] <feep[work]> Nivim: anyway thanks, that helped concretify it a lot.
[10:48:27] <Nivim> nshepperd2: I guess so? I have never accepted any sexuality, it tried to not take no for an answer, and so I'm even less likely to accept it than I started.
[10:49:04] <feep[work]> fresh from the #lesswrong hot take factory: puberty is literally rape
[10:49:12] <nshepperd2> that sounds bad
[10:49:31] <Nivim> Basically I view all sexual urges as hostile mind control and obsessively make sure they influence my decisions and thoughts as little as possible.
[10:49:58] <feep[work]> speculating
[10:50:04] <feep[work]> did you always have a really strong idea what sort of person you were?
[10:50:43] <feep[work]> also are you very introspective?
[10:51:04] <feep[work]> sorry, programmer thing, I see a weird state and I want to reconstruct how the system got in there XD
[10:52:18] <quanticle> feep[work]: Man, you *know* what happened the last I read Zach's blog
[10:52:22] <Nivim> A fairly strong idea; when things like starvation or choices like "do you break your own rules or die", I tend to pick die and survive by luck or the kindness of strangers. Perhaps autistically strong, although I'm much less autistic than I was.
[10:52:30] <quanticle> We got sucked into like a four hour discussion on handwriting
[10:52:30] <feep[work]> quanticle: I actually don't remember. :D
[10:52:37] <quanticle> Complete with actually doing handwriting
[10:52:37] <feep[work]> ohhh right, handwritegate
[10:52:42] <feep[work]> I still haven't gotten you that sample.
[10:52:45] <feep[work]> remind me in the afternoon.
[10:52:57] <quanticle> Nah, it's fine, I don't care that much, take your time
[10:53:12] <Nivim> The introsepction question is harder; I tend to fail to be introspective often, but I certainly /try/ to work stuff like that out.
[10:53:29] <feep[work]> Nivim: like, my model here is that you formed a really strong coherent identity before puberty, which is not supposed to happen
[10:53:42] <Nivim> I guess in sheer work hours I'm very introspective, but I would judge my success rate annoyingly low.
[10:54:04] <Nivim> Ah, puberty hit me around 15-16 rather than earlier as a lot of other kids did.
[10:54:10] <feep[work]> ah right
[10:54:15] <Nivim> So that could easily be it.
[10:54:26] <feep[work]> like, I think what's supposed to happen is sexuality gets turned on and then you start integrating that into your self-model which congeals around ... 16-20 or so
[10:54:34] <Nivim> (I was extremely stubborn back when I was 10 though, so that might not be it entirely.)
[10:54:38] <feep[work]> more later nowadays
[10:54:49] <feep[work]> no yeah that fits.
[10:55:17] <feep[work]> like, it's one of the most widespread clichees of humankind that teenagers don't know who they are
[10:55:28] <feep[work]> and I think that's an important mechanism to allow puberty to work at all
[10:55:34] <Nivim> Yeah, puberity finally stopped being miseral around 21-23 for me, so it's like the whole thing got delayed 4 years.
[10:56:04] <Nivim> s/rity/rty/ s/eral/erable/
[10:56:34] <feep[work]> the hot take here is "travel back in time after the singularity to resurrect ... our childselves, who deserve independent stable existence"
[10:57:11] <feep[work]> I'm not sure I fully buy that in universality, but it's hard to argue that growing up can completely change who you are
[10:57:24] <Nivim> That would be sweet and heartfelt; I would like a lot more than one version brought back from my previous dead selves.
[10:57:33] <feep[work]> (inasmuch as an early teen can manage to be someone coherent at all ofc)
[10:57:37] <feep[work]> Nivim: yeah same <3
[10:57:43] <feep[work]> "did I do good? did I do right by you?"
[10:57:54] <feep[work]> "was I30 a good I15?"

[10:58:49] <feep[work]> that's beautiful
[10:58:54] <Nivim> Hah, well I know that's a bad question for me, since a lot of my selves have mutually contradictory views and some wouldn't be able to be brought back due to trying to immediately subvert and murder all others, but you know, I'd like most of them to get to exist even if they wouldn't like a lot of the others.
[10:59:09] <feep[work]> teach them your future superpower: liberalism~
[10:59:35] <feep[work]> or rather, "hugs, but I repeat myself"
[11:00:01] <feep[work]> I think one of the earliest things I decided was ... like, if you can't even embrace yourself, that's just a poor selfhood.
[11:00:23] <Nivim> (There's definitely a version of me that would disown all later ones due to how I changed my mind on whether I was willing to lie to save a life; the youngest of me don't consider lying acceptable under /any/ circumstances, no matter how grevious.)
[11:00:36] <feep[work]> anyway, a nonzero amount of actual work needs to be done here
[11:00:46] <Nivim> Ah! That name isn't just for show!
[11:00:50] <feep[work]> ^^
[11:00:50] <Nivim> Good luck.

[11:01:00] <feep[work]> thanks :stares at editor: fucking gonna need it
[11:01:10] <Nivim> =}
[11:01:22] <quanticle> Your adult personality grows underneath your child personality and eventually pushes it out
[11:01:49] <feep[work]> quanticle: how do I put this uh
[11:01:56] <Nivim> Unfortunately it feels the other way around for me; like they're layered on top, and brain-damage or old age strips away layers.
[11:02:18] <feep[work]> remembering ... I was always like this. Like, latent at least. I can sort of see in hindsight what held me back, and what laid certain groundwork
[11:02:23] <Nivim> (Except the ones underneath aren't wholy intact anymore due to time, so they don't work right.)
[11:02:59] <feep[work]> for me it's ..... like, I have a thing where I don't really model people as people, I don't have the hardware for it
[11:03:04] <feep[work]> I can only model them as copies of myself
[11:03:17] <feep[work]> and I don't think I remember clearly anymore how I thought.
[11:03:32] <feep[work]> so I can extrapolate backwards, but I'm extrapolating over, not into.
[11:03:49] <quanticle> I don't think old-age or brain damage strips away layers; I think it just breaks the person. My mom works with old people and she tells me from conversations with patients' families that when you have a stroke or something, you might become childlike... but it's not likely that you'll regress to anywhere near the same personality you had when you were actually a child.
[11:04:42] <Nivim> That is far more depressing than I expected such a kind of thought to be.
[11:04:44] <nshepperd2> 'personalities are like teeth' 'yeah... you have a whole extra set of them crammed inside your skull like sardines'
[11:04:55] <quanticle> Getting old sucks
[11:05:22] <Nivim> It has many layers of sucking, one for each of your personalities. =] =/
[11:05:24] <feep[work]> "happy birthday!" "oh boy, what's my present?" "you got OLDER" 
[11:05:53] <quanticle> This is why we give presents on birthdays; getting older sucks, so you might as well get something to soothe the pain
[11:06:29] <Nivim> There are people who have bought into the idea that each new year is to be celebrated and mean it, but they are also people who tend to ignore particular things.
[11:07:40] <saturn2> i think you probably shouldn't introspect any more
[11:08:02] <Nivim> (There's this 60-something lady I recall who could still get genuinely excited about her next birthday, even if she was having it alone due to practical/COVID issues, and I found that inspiring at least.)
[11:08:57] <Nivim> (The near-100s that get excited for their next birthday are a bit more understandable, since it's another year they've cheated death.)
[11:10:03] <Nivim> saturn2: Do the last 12 peices or so count as introspection? Does just the way I think read as introspection, to you at least?

[11:28:04] <quanticle> *imperialized
[11:44:28] <quanticle> So I was reading this article about the thermal limits of Starlink ground stations: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/06/starlink-dish-overheats-in-arizona-sun-knocking-user-offline-for-7-hours/ and I was annoyed by their insistence on Fahrenheit
[11:44:28] <Robomot> Starlink dishes go into “thermal shutdown” once they hit 122° Fahrenheit | Ars Technica (Man watered dish to cool it down but overheating knocked it offline for 7 hours.)
[11:44:57] <quanticle> 122ºF is 50ºC
[11:45:23] <adiabatic> that's a little cooler than 129°, what you'd sous-vide a steak at
[11:45:23] <quanticle> The restart temperature, 104ºF is 40ºC
[11:45:43] <adiabatic> if it were in °C I wouldn't have known
[11:46:02] <adiabatic> no, I am not Dave Arnold, who sous-vides entirely in °C despite being American
[11:46:07] <quanticle> 122 and 104 look like arbitrary made up numbers whereas 50 and 40 are numbers you can look and say, "Yeah, that was chosen by an engineer"
[11:48:42] <quanticle> And the low temperature limit is reported as -22ºF, which looks similarly stupid and made up, whereas the metric conversion is -30ºC, which is a sensible number.

[19:11:33] <dbohdan2> gwern: To buy streamers' old controllers is an especially smooth move.  If you were an investor on a sub-hedge fund scale, you could specialize in controllers.  They are small, non-perishable, seen as useful, and hold a closer connection to the streamer's show (and their history-making achievements if they are a speedrunner) than a t-shirt.
[19:19:12] <dbohdan> feep: I have experienced some degree of depersonalization, some of which I attribute to my gender dysphoria.  "in a sexual context, it's like the sign flips?" "that's not agp is it." -- well, I think this actually aligns with Blanchard.  He has developed a theory of "erotic target location error" or "erotic target identity inversion" as the underlying cause of AGP.  At least according to some versions, it is supposed to activate with arousal.  
[19:19:12] <dbohdan> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotic_target_location_error
[19:19:13] <Robomot> Erotic target location error - Wikipedia (Erotic target location error (ETLE) is a hypothesized[by whom?] paraphilia defined by having a sexual preference or strong sexual interest in features that are somewhere other than on one's sexual partners.[1] …)
[19:19:58] <dbohdan> feep: If anything, Blanchard struggles with why the effect may persist *outside* of a sexual setting and invents epicycles to explain it
[19:22:02] <dbohdan> feep: I think the connection between believing in AGP and being anti-trans is weakly or not at all causal in the direction of AGP => anti-trans.  A recent comment by tailcalled on Davis's blog explains it nicely.  'I feel like people overestimate that Blanchardian/transphobia link due to confounding (anti-trans people know that Blanchardianism pisses trans people off, and so pick it up, leading to a correlation despite less causal influence of 
[19:22:02] <dbohdan> Blanchardianism on attitudes to trans people). It seems like it should be relevant to investigate empirically, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.'  http://unremediatedgender.space/2020/Nov/interlude-xx/#isso-230
[19:22:03] <Robomot> Interlude XX ★ The Scintillating But Ultimately Untrue Thought
[19:23:25] <dbohdan> Nivim: "Basically I view all sexual urges as hostile mind control"  They are hostile in the sense that your genes are trying to make you do their bidding against how your normal-mode mind functions
[19:25:47] <feep> dbohdan: right, but it's less like ... it's not ... I don't think it's precisely erotic target location per se, it's more ... 
[19:25:56] <feep> like, I think of it more as *erotic identity location error*.
[19:26:17] <feep> the problem isn't the target pick exactly :p
[19:26:31] <feep> well, inasmuch as any kink can be in error
[19:26:47] <dbohdan> Hmm.  I don't think I understand the difference.
[19:27:46] *** Quits: badsektor (~badsektor@user/badsektor) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:28:05] <feep> okay, like. it's not like being a woman inherently turns me on as a man per se. it's more that I'm ... like, if you assume stuff like "I am having sex" and "I am a target of erotic interest"
[19:28:40] <feep> my brain is the happiest with it, erotically speaking, if the self that is having those experiences at the time is a cute catgirl.
[19:29:14] <feep> but not a different person per se, still in the sense that they're fully me.
[19:29:43] <feep> just like, presenting a different mode I guess.
[19:29:49] <PapuaHardyNet> huh
[19:30:07] <feep> like, I'm experiencing this first-person. It's not a separate person that I identify with.
[19:30:27] <feep> in terms of erotic sensation, it's overlaid over my current body map.
[19:31:01] <dbohdan> This doesn't sound different from how I remember ETLE being described as feeling from inside
[19:31:13] <feep> sure, that makes sense
[19:31:20] <feep> I guess I'm just not sure about the word.
[19:32:04] <dbohdan> The terminology around all of this isn't the best
[19:32:10] <feep> yeah
[19:32:18] <feep> aside AGP, which ... like, we all know the post.
[19:32:20] <dbohdan> You should try to coin better terms if you can

[19:33:35] <dbohdan> I don't think you will be able to escape the stigma of talking about AGP for long with just new terms, though
[19:34:04] <feep> dbohdan: I think the point is I guess it has nothing to do with the target of my *preference*.
[19:34:08] <feep> my preference is totally decoupled from it.
[19:34:38] <PapuaHardyNet> if sexual urges is mindcontrol, then chemically castrating yourself is the only way to gain freedom
[19:35:06] <PapuaHardyNet> (there's an undercurrent of sarcasm to my previous message)

[19:40:16] <PapuaHardyNet> (antidepressants are some sustainable ways to kill your sexual appetite)
[19:40:23] <dbohdan> PapuaHardyNet: Why the sarcasm?  I don't necessarily agree with it, but it is a perfectly valid position.

[19:42:36] <dbohdan> PapuaHardyNet: That's what they [genes] want!
[19:42:51] <PapuaHardyNet> lol
[19:43:41] *** Joins: Guest9 (~Guest9@103.250.137.30)
[19:43:49] <PapuaHardyNet> but yes, killing your sexual desire, or neutralizing it, would increase the quality of life for *many* men in this world
[19:44:07] <PapuaHardyNet> that's one rudimentary step towards transhumanism too
[19:45:30] <PapuaHardyNet> on that note
[19:45:48] *** Quits: gareppa (~gareppa@user/gareppa) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:46:06] <PapuaHardyNet> if there is a sustainable way to kill a man's sexual desire / appetite without harming their health in the long term, perhaps it should be subsidized by the government
[19:46:17] <PapuaHardyNet> it would improve society considerably
[19:47:23] <dbohdan> Xenoestrogens from plastic?  If they work, problem solved.
[19:47:58] <PapuaHardyNet> mate, I don't want everyone to be femboys
[19:48:28] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps it is impossible to separate the benefits of testosterone from the sexual desire it generates. But if it does, then we have struck gold
[19:48:33] <Betawolf> just keep everyone playing videogames. 
[19:48:44] <PapuaHardyNet> that... that works too
[19:49:27] <Betawolf> Can't meet girls if you never go outside *taps head*.
[19:49:58] <dbohdan> "I don't want everyone to be femboys"  Does not compute
[19:51:14] <PapuaHardyNet> you want your culture and society to be able to defend against those who do not follow your mores
[19:51:43] <PapuaHardyNet> femboys are cute af, but you can't have every man be a femboy
[19:52:03] <PapuaHardyNet> women are attracted to sexually dimorphic men, so they'll defect to outsiders
[19:52:22] <PapuaHardyNet> so yes, you don't want every man to be a femboy in your culture / society
[19:59:09] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : all programs should have the ability to rename the filename of the file they have open. It doesn't have to be easily accessible, heck you could force the windows security screen to pop up if you want to, I just would like the option.
[20:00:10] <catern> I want to tell my boss that, the reason I don't want to report what I'm doing every day is, because by making myself legible I make myself governable (ala Seeing Like A State) (and that I think/we've already agreed that my decisions are sometimes better than his)
[20:00:28] <catern> however that is an obscure reference he probably won't get
[20:00:49] <catern> suggestions on the best analogy to explain this concept?
[20:01:02] <catern> explain "Seeing Like A State"-style legibility, I mean
[20:01:15] <dbohdan> catern: Definitely don't mention not wanting "to be governable".  It ought to be misunderstood.
[20:02:07] <pompolic> maybe he'll be amenable to the argument that making yourself legible imposes a cost
[20:02:13] <pompolic> that would be better spent on actually working
[20:02:16] <pompolic> or something
[20:02:17] <dbohdan> The closest mainstream concept might be "micromanagement"
[20:03:27] <dbohdan> PapuaHardyNet: "Femboy" is mostly a physical aesthetic, IMO.  It doesn't strongly imply physical weakness or a lack of martial qualities.  These traits are correlated with feminine appearance in males right now, but even a moderately transhuman society could have combat-ready femboys.
[20:03:35] <dbohdan> </anime-premise>
[20:03:37] <catern> dbohdan: yes, true
[20:03:56] <feep> [17:16] <PapuaHardyNet> it would improve society considerably
[20:04:03] <feep> I'm sorry, in what universe would that not totally explode society
[20:04:12] <dbohdan> catern: How would your boss take "I don't want to micromanaged"?
[20:04:14] <catern> dbohdan: and... I guess micromanagement is actually clearly the best analogy since it's directly relevant
[20:04:21] <dbohdan> Yep
[20:04:28] <catern> oh don't worry about the political implications
[20:04:35] <feep> like, it would improve society if we assume society is perfectly pliable and docile ... but then we don't need xenoestrogen lol
[20:05:01] <PapuaHardyNet> imagine a society where men are stoic bastards
[20:05:10] <dbohdan> catern: Okay, good
[20:05:12] <catern> (he's very understanding, and I'm a key employee, and I'm ready to quit anyway)
[20:05:16] <PapuaHardyNet> one where they don't jerk off to weird shit, or spend money on onlyfans
[20:05:28] <PapuaHardyNet> it would be a society I would be proud to be a part of
[20:05:30] <feep> I'm sorry, stoics are not supposed to jerk it to weird shit?
[20:05:47] <PapuaHardyNet> :| aw come on, I'm not debating Stoicism with you again
[20:05:49] <feep> that sounds like they're meant to care about approval or something
[20:06:10] <PapuaHardyNet> use the normie definition of stoicness, not the greek philosophy of living
[20:06:26] <feep> IT MATTER NOT HOW QUEER THE KINK
[20:06:33] <feep> okay fine stopping
[20:06:54] <dbohdan> catern: You're playing a book-based CCG.  Your boss has played _Seeing Like A State_, and you're countering with _Exit, Voice, and Loyalty_.
[20:07:11] <feep> shit man, inviolate elseworlds comic book when
[20:07:20] <catern> dbohdan: quite so
[20:07:55] <catern> okay actually though
[20:07:55] <feep> dbohdan: he counters: _The Gunslinger._
[20:08:09] <feep> ("Go then: there are other jobs than these...")
[20:08:11] <catern> I think framing this with an unrelated story from Seeing Like A State might be very helpful
[20:09:13] <catern> since that would both 1. support the notion of the subject having superior metis than the ruler and 2. support the notion of legibility resulting in worse outcomes by allowing more control by the ruler
[20:09:45] <catern> even though you're right that micromanagement is the most direct analogy (it's not even an analogy, really!), I think a more distant one is politically helpful..

[20:17:25] <pompolic> what i would do if i didn't give a fuck is point out that the request implies wanting a transfer of decisionmaking in some area from you to him
[20:17:33] <pompolic> and give a "do you feel lucky" speech or something
[20:17:55] <catern> maybe I can just link https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/ to him

[20:18:05] <PapuaHardyNet> you really think he will read that
[20:18:10] <catern> and then once he's read it, say, "so you see how that's related?"

[20:18:33] <pompolic> or if they sell themselves as looking for independent, competent people, then point out that this goes against company principles
[20:18:34] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: Sure, that wouldn't be my concern, my concern would be if that post is too politicial for work
[20:18:48] <pompolic> in practice i am terribly afraid of getting into any sort of confrontation
[20:18:52] <catern> I mean, "Seeing Like A State" is a political book, so it's pretty political...
[20:19:13] <catern> pompolic: your wording ("implies wanting a transfer of decisionmaking in some area from you to him") is really good though
[20:19:20] <dbohdan> pompolic: Relatable
[20:19:23] <feep> also lol, never seen so much toxicity in a comments section

[20:20:16] <catern> anyone want to express a thought on whether https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/ is too political to link at work?

[20:21:53] <feep> exit voice: opposite of inside voice
[20:21:56] <dbohdan> catern: It depends on the politics of your boss.  If the boss has mainstream political views, possibly.  If he is libertarianish, it is probably okay.
[20:22:00] <catern> feep: lol
[20:22:39] <pompolic> *bong rip* ah yes, the grammar of silence
[20:23:13] <dbohdan> (If your boss takes "authoritarian high modernism" as a personal slight...)
[20:24:45] <pompolic> actually thinking further

[20:25:07] <pompolic> maybe you could find out what he wants to make decisions about
[20:25:11] <pompolic> in your stead
[20:25:29] <pompolic> maybe he'll feel stupid when he says it out loud (this never works)
[20:26:01] <pompolic> note that i have a bias towards thinking way too adversarially
[20:27:13] <catern> i have a bad habit personally, which is that I start with the weird bizarre conclusion
[20:27:25] <pompolic> that too
[20:28:05] <catern> like, as an example, just saying "so ultimately this is about transferring decisionmaking power from me to you" about this
[20:28:17] <pompolic> i sometimes say "my brain is wired backwards", due to starting with the end of the train of thought i went to, and taking a really long circuitous path to what started the train of thought

The writing seemed to say on despite the heavy abuse at the hands of gamers.  Controller plastic should be similar to that of mice, no?  A possible problem is that many (most?) modern gamepads are black and therefore must be signed in white marker.  I haven't seen a white marker as permanent as a normal black sharpie.
[21:41:13] <gwern> when I think of a modern controller I tend to think of something extremely slick, durable, and unchanging - old keyboards or mice were grainy, rapidly yellowed or got dirty easily. something like an xbox controller shrugs off mountain dew and cheeto dust. so I figure they've upgraded the materials tremendously (much like everything else has been upgraded each year by materials scientists)

[23:13:55] <two2thehead> :V
[23:14:28] <two2thehead> hmm "Tallying the scorecard is difficult, especially when the numbers are not all available. Despite over 4,360 projectiles fired at Israel, Iron Dome maintained its 90% interception rate. While 12 people were killed by rockets, and at least 1,325 buildings and 738 cars were damaged, the outcome could have been far worse. At the end of the day, Iron Dome did not run out of missiles. Its high interception rate means that barrages were unable to reach 
[23:14:28] <two2thehead> the point of oversaturation. "
[23:14:38] <feep> dbohdan: I shall add a /nasuroar command
[23:15:31] <dbohdan> feep: Nasu?
[23:15:44] <feep> it shall use sparklines to /say:
[23:15:50] <ggreer> it needs to make modem sounds when launching
[23:16:00] <ggreer> and hard drive sounds every once in a while
[23:16:01] <feep> ▁▁▂▂▄▄▆▆███████
[23:16:30] <dbohdan> lol
[23:17:16] <dbohdan> I thought more like a message frequency graph by hour
[23:17:19] <feep> with a cute exclamation mark at the end
[23:17:26] <feep> dbohdan: oh that's clever, I can stick that in the status line
[23:17:35] <dbohdan> \o/
[23:17:55] <feep> anyway, goal for today is at least displaying some menu
[23:18:15] <feep> also: showering, I feel incredibly icky after today's temperature
[23:18:26] <feep> er, some dialog*
[23:19:18] <dbohdan> feep: Have you ever played with Visual Basic for DOS?  While I never made anything serious with it, I can recommend it for TUI inspiration.
[23:19:58] <feep> I'm squarely focused on edit.com for now
[23:22:03] <dbohdan> Well, if you ever want to try it, https://archive.org/details/visual_basic_ms_dos_prof_100 (I actually couldn't find a working English version)
[23:22:04] <Robomot> Microsoft Visual basic für MS-DOS – Professionelle Ausgabe : Microsoft : Free Borrow & Streaming : Internet Archive
[23:22:16] <dbohdan> It works in the browser
[23:25:45] <feep> hm
[23:25:53] <feep> dbohdan: yeah that's a very different visual style than I'm aiming at
[23:26:10] <feep> though they kept the menus the same
[23:26:33] <feep> I'm aiming more at http://jamesfriend.com.au/pce-js/ibmpc-games/
[23:26:34] <Robomot> PCE.js IBM PC/DOS in the Browser
[23:27:02] <feep> (enter edit.com)
[23:29:59] <ggreer> the mastering sounds different from the previous eva soundtracks. maybe less accentuation on the bass?
[23:32:16] <two2thehead> dang the bootup text brings back memories
[23:42:27] <dbohdan> feep: They aren't that different.  The main menu and the file dialogs are very similar, for example.  In some ways edit.com is actually more refined than VB 1.  The most noticeable is that buttons don't have the unnecessary heavy Windows 3.x-style outlines.  But edit.com doesn't implement all the widgets VB does.  If you have a hard time deciding how a widget that isn't in edit.com should work, consider stealing the design from VB or Turbo Vision.

[23:57:58] <feep> dbohdan: I mean, I'm p much gonna add a forms widget and that's basically it
[23:58:04] <feep> not like I need a file open dialog for irc :p
[23:58:15] <feep> wokay, maybe a dropdown
[23:59:30] <ggreer> what the hell? did they actually sew two rats together? wouldn't there be tons of immune issues?
[23:59:40] <feep> maybe they're clones
