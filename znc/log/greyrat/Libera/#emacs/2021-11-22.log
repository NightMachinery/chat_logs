[00:33:09] <thblt> that's… a lot.  I don't know Swift, but I was under the impression it's a regular statically-typed language where most of the type work is done at compile-time.
[00:34:01] <hodapp> if that overhead is there, it almost solely tends to be "dynamic handling of types at runtime" and not due to any sort of type-safety but to things that are just inherent to dynamic types

[07:05:08] <k-man> why does re-builder stick extra \\ in when I copy the RE using c-c c-w ?
[07:05:31] <mns> release engineering is a lot of automation work involving your SCM (git, svn, cvs), build tools (maven, gradle, make), build management (jenkins), artifact storage (nexus, artifactory), deployment (jenkins, home grown tools).  also known as CI/CD and/or DevOps
[07:06:33] <twb> oh so you're not actually DOING releases
[07:06:56] <twb> You're writing issue trackers and stuff to make doing releases easier
[07:07:42] <mns> releases are done by someone on the dev team.  there are too many dev teams and products.  our group provides them the means to do the release in whatever method works for them.  
[07:07:54] <bpalmer> k-man: if you're looking at it in string form, you are probably seeing escape sequences
[07:08:14] <k-man> ah
[07:08:25] <bpalmer> k-man: for example, the string "\\"  is a single character, as you can tell when you do (length "\\") => 1
[07:09:12] <bpalmer> so if you had a  regular expression that used a \b , for example, in a string that would *look* like "\\b" . But (length "\\b") => 2
[07:09:15] <k-man> so... what form do I want it in so i can build a regexp in re-builder, then c-c c-w then paste it into replace-regexp?
[07:09:40] <bpalmer> k-man: if you're writing lisp, you're dealing with strings, so you want those escapes added in.
[07:09:47] <k-man> ah i see
[07:09:54] <bpalmer> if you're calling M-x replace-regexp RET , you aren't dealing with strings, so you don't.

[07:10:07] <mns> hope that helps
[07:11:06] <k-man> bpalmer: I'm doing the latter
[07:11:13] <twb> sounds to me like your devs are idiots and your separate team exists to clean up after them
[07:12:06] <twb> Or I guess the nice way to put it is: someone who only speaks (say) SQL doesn't know how to write makefiles or unit tests
[07:12:20] <mns> twb: there are some that would fall into the idiot category .. but its not cleaning up afer them
[07:14:42] <codingquark> Good morning!
[07:15:18] <mns> twb: I would put it as, release engineering is like the water dept are in a town  .. home owners don't make their own pipelines to the water reservoir ... same concept.  developers (home owners) just have to know where to hook up things ... the rest is taken care of by the plumbing infrastructure that the release engineers put in place
[07:15:31] <mns> morning codingquark 
[07:15:35] <codingquark> :)
[07:15:40] <bpalmer> k-man: a little bit of simple experimentation may  be in order ,but I suspect that re-builder is mostly intended for use with writing lisp
[07:15:56] <bpalmer> k-man: since M-x replace-regexp RET is intended for  "ephemeral" changes
[07:16:02] <twb> I guess if you have that many people that you need a specialist

[07:43:17] <bpalmer> umaxtu: (ocaml is another language that grew out of ML)
[07:43:25] <bpalmer> unless you go for forth.
[07:43:31] <technomancy[m]> aidalgol: descent was a ton more fun tho
[07:43:35] <umaxtu> ok, thanks
[07:43:46] <aidalgol> Yeah, it pretty much leaves just Forth.
[07:43:58] <codingquark> aidalgol: I thought I am supposed to scream and flail around as I write for embedded system. A part of the common, established workflow!
[07:44:07] <umaxtu> only reason I've heard of forth is that there was a minecraft mod that used it
[07:44:24] <codingquark> Is forth a game or a language?
[07:44:26] <aidalgol> technomancy[m]: Those games never gave me motion sickness, but had a hell of a time controlling my ship.

[07:44:55] <technomancy[m]> aidalgol: one cool thing is descent had more colors in it than grey and brown
[07:44:57] <aidalgol> codingquark: It's a stack-based language, so it's a bit of a mindfuck at first.
[07:45:10] <aidalgol> technomancy[m]: Yeah, after Doom 2, it sounds like Id was a really shitty place to work.
[07:45:17] <peterhil_> codingquark: Forth is a stack based language. It was used in old Mac firmware for example.

[07:46:37] <poselyqualityles> refal is the way
[07:46:49] <technomancy[m]> aidalgol: and now he works for zuck, making sure to dispel any lingering doubt
[07:46:52] <aidalgol> Apparently he also refused to hire more people during that year to help speed things along, so when the engine was ready, everyone else was burnt out.
[07:47:06] <codingquark> aidalgol: when Carmack appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast, he accepted that he used to love saying "it will be done when it will be done", but has learned otherwise now
[07:47:46] <aidalgol> codingquark: That doesn't mean he's any less of a shitty person to work for.  It just means he knows that line won't fly in his career now.
[07:47:47] <peterhil_> poselyqualityles: Did you mean Rebol? That's made by Carl Sassenrath of Amiga fame.
[07:48:16] <aidalgol> technomancy[m]: Romero seems to at least have developed *some* sense of self-awareness, by comparison.

[13:00:25] <lockywolf> I'm using eglot with ccls for c++ development, and so far it behaves okay, better than semantic-c++ on my code. However, it doesn't seem to find definitions in .h files. I remember there was some tweak to make it follow "non-project" include-files, but now I don't seem to be able to find it.

[23:42:49] <grym> are there vc.el packages that "ape" magit for different backends?  (i am screwing around with fossil, and want the same kind of transient menu UX as magit)
[23:42:59] <acdw> that's a good idea
[23:44:40] <bpalmer> not vc.el, but there  are some things inspired by magit
[23:44:46] <bpalmer> e.g. ,,monkey
[23:44:47] <fsbot> try:  greasemonkey monkeys monkeysphere
[23:44:53] <bpalmer> ,monky
[23:44:53] <fsbot> bpalmer: monky is A magit-like interface for hg, naïvely hosted by git: https://github.com/ananthakumaran/monky
[23:45:27] <bpalmer> perhaps there's something specific for fossil.
[23:45:47] <cvandusen> I guess hghub.com is not a thing.

[23:47:31] <acdw> mafossil
[23:47:32] <bpalmer> rudybot: the internet isn't large enough to have multiple hubs
[23:47:33] <acdw> m'fossil
[23:47:37] <rudybot> bpalmer: there's a mirror on the git hubs.
[23:48:18] <cvandusen> rudybot:  when you stare into the hubs, the hubs stare into you 
[23:48:21] <rudybot> cvandusen: but it seems to be just with the hubs, the servers themselves are running as usual so connecting directly to say kornbluth works fine
[23:49:59] <bpalmer> space merchants are happy to bypass intermediaries.
