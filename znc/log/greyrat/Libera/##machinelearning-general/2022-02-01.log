[14:58:14] <hodapp> that may be misleading as someone might take it to mean that the weights are shared when they're not
[15:03:33] <hodapp> there is no special term that's used; when papers want to show repetition they'll typically just describe some module (visually or not) and show they are instantiating the module multiple times
[15:05:50] <hodapp> e.g. see figure 1 in "Attention is All You Need" - where they have that "N x" near things - and in section 3.1 where they just say "identical layers"

[20:14:14] <justanotheruser> Why do public datasets split their data into training, validation, and test sets? Shouldn't this separation be done by the researcher?
[20:15:35] <mefistofeles> justanotheruser: yeah, that's kinda odd, unless they already know it's a good split... :/
[20:15:36] <mefistofeles> justanotheruser: can you link to an example?
[20:15:39] <hodapp> it still can be if they want to
[20:15:56] <hodapp> but a lot of public datasets were public because of some sort of competition where initially it was only train/val that was made public
[20:17:46] <justanotheruser> mefistofeles: it's pretty much 1/2 of the public datasets I come across. e.g. https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/download.html
[20:17:47] <SigmoidFroid> ⇒  Open Images V6 - Download
[20:17:57] <justanotheruser> hodapp: oh that makes sense
[20:18:09] <justanotheruser> I assume the test set isn't released until the end of the competition
[20:18:20] <hodapp> but it's standard to leave them as they are so that people can compare their later results against published results and competition results
[20:18:43] <justanotheruser> ah
[20:18:57] <hodapp> but anyone can re-combine and re-split the data if they want
[20:19:01] <justanotheruser> ya that makes perfect sense in the context of comparing results across research papers
[20:19:36] <mefistofeles> yeah, if it's from competition it makes sense
[20:19:42] <mefistofeles> but still, seems odd :P
[20:20:58] <justanotheruser> second question, what is your model selection procedure? Generally I check for research papers tackling an analogous problem, check on semantic scholar for any work built on top of it, check on paperswithcode for comparison of architectures applied to the same dataset and how they performed, then try it on my dataset

[23:53:52] <mefistofeles> I guess that's a way of thinking about it, sure
