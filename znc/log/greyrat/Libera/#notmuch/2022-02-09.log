[01:40:46] *** Quits: jao (~jao@211.68.17.95.dynamic.jazztel.es) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:41:36] <aplund> it comes from the "bindings" directory within the release tarball
[01:41:47] <aplund> oh.. I see there's an update to 0.35.

[01:48:32] <aplund> fwiw, here's the trace: https://gist.github.com/aplund/ae76ea4e6d66f3e0f29aebbd6d74690f
[02:00:02] <bremner> aplund: there's two python modules in that directory, python and python-cffi. The former is deprecated since July 2020.
[02:02:45] <bremner> Based on the backtrace, it looks like you are using the deprecated bindings.
[02:04:46] <aplund> oh.
[02:05:59] <bremner> so if you want the new XDG support, you'll need to port to the new bindings. It's mostly pretty easy.
[02:08:33] <aplund> ahh.. it's lieer that's got the problem.
[02:09:48] <bremner> is it python?
[02:10:31] <aplund> seems to be https://github.com/gauteh/lieer/issues/173
[02:11:46] <aplund> looks like they have migrated, but not the "standard" branch.

[04:00:18] <aplund> I'm so confused as to how to read the config using the notmuch2 interface.  When I do a list(d.config) it's always empty (where d is the Database() instance)
[04:05:39] <bremner> aplund: ah yes there was some discussion about how to do get_directory on the list. I think the original proposer ran out of time or interest
[04:06:57] <bremner> aplund: try accessing d.config like a dictionary
[04:07:09] <aplund> bremner: d.config is empty
[04:07:28] <bremner> see python-cffi/tests/test_config.py for examples
[04:07:31] <aplund> I must be doing something wrong.
[04:09:14] <bremner> here's a simple example:https://paste.debian.net/1230089/
[04:10:01] <aplund> bremner: that's exactly what I'm doing..... list(db.config) == [] on my database
[04:10:32] <bremner> yeah, I'm not convinced list() is doing the right thing there. What if you access an individual element?
[04:12:00] <aplund> everything is KeyError
[04:12:17] <bremner> what if you run _exactly_ the code I pasted?
[04:13:01] <aplund> ohhhhh.. wait. it's not hierarcial
[04:13:25] <bremner> no, not really
[04:13:39] <aplund> db.config['new'] is Key error but db.config['new.tags'] is fine
[04:13:46] <bremner> right.
[04:14:22] <bremner> I suggest asking the mailing list about list(). Floris (or some other pythonista) may understand better than I what _should_ work
[04:15:44] <bremner> ah. actually, I think I understand the bug

[14:57:53] <aplund> Bremner, I'll paste an example later, but it's notmuch2 python and I'm accessing the query iterator from outside the loop (saving the instances in an array). It should probably have a nicer error than a sigabrt
