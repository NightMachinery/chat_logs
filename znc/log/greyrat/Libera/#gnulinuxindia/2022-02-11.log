[06:45:45] <NeoVoid[m]1> The game has started.
[06:45:45] <NeoVoid[m]1> First they bought old channels with thousands of follower 
[06:45:45] <NeoVoid[m]1> then they turn them into some topic related cool channels. 
[06:45:45] <NeoVoid[m]1> and after creating a market they put them on sale.

[07:15:17] <sla[m]12> > why is uniq not working here
[07:15:17] <sla[m]12> use sort before uniq
[07:41:29] <JB[m]> <sla[m]12> "> <J B> history | cut -c 8..." <- So uniq compares with immediate next
[08:09:36] <JB[m]> <sla[m]12> "> <J B> history | cut -c 8..." <- fzf list is sorted alphabetically after that
[08:09:36] <JB[m]> fzf â€”tac is not effective , which makes the recent command first

[13:33:48] <gtlsgamr> How many of you play video games? These are the ones I play a LOT! http://0x0.st/oXEQ.png
[13:34:07] <gtlsgamr> well the first few
[13:36:13] <Ankit[m]> gtlsgamr: On gnu/linux?
[13:36:21] <gtlsgamr> yes
[13:39:19] <Ankit[m]> Is this steam and also did you purchased them?
[13:39:27] <iamak[m]> <gtlsgamr> "How many of you play video games..." <- I play CSGO, Hades
[13:40:54] <iamak[m]> Ankit[m]: CSGO is free on steam
[13:43:48] <iamak[m]> Anyone used `Waydroid` on `X`
[13:43:49] <iamak[m]> s/`/`?/
[13:49:07] <hemish> i always forget the site which we can upload files to with curl. It ends with .st this is all i remember, i couldnt find it after surfing bugswriter channel for half an hour now, can anybody tell me
[13:49:26] <hemish> oh i remember now
[13:49:30] <hemish> its 0x0.st
[13:51:26] <gtlsgamr> Ankit[m]: yes, it is steam. I got them all in sales.
[13:51:34] <gtlsgamr> purchased them but not at MRP.
[13:52:21] <gtlsgamr> except rdr2. that cost me about 1.5k rupees. but it is worth every paisa.
[13:59:09] <iamak[m]> gtlsgamr: you use DE or WM?
[13:59:18] <gtlsgamr> dwm baby
[13:59:25] <iamak[m]> I found that some games don't work well with WM (switching workspaces and all)
[13:59:34] <iamak[m]> gtlsgamr: Same. You dont face the issue?
[13:59:41] <gtlsgamr> none at all
[13:59:47] <gtlsgamr> ALL games I have played worked perfectly
[14:00:04] <gtlsgamr> except the occasional nvidia update, but that just requires rebuilding the kernel modules
[14:00:07] <gtlsgamr> http://0x0.st/oXEt.png
[14:01:30] <iamak[m]> That's a nice config
[14:02:24] <iamak[m]> I play on Intel HD 620 graphics ðŸ˜Ž
[14:03:20] <gtlsgamr> I remember those datys
[14:03:30] <gtlsgamr> make some money then buy a better one!
[14:03:48] <iamak[m]> Yeah that's the plan but GPU prices ;_;
[14:04:10] <gtlsgamr> GPUs are a meme
[14:04:13] <gtlsgamr> get an avg one, like mine
[14:04:16] <gtlsgamr> then forget
[14:04:24] <gtlsgamr> you dont need RTX, you dont need DLSS
[14:04:28] <iamak[m]> I was thikning of waiting for Intel ARC
[14:04:37] <gtlsgamr> games are about stories, and those that aren't, dont need graphx
[14:04:38] <iamak[m]> It's supposed to be cheap. Q1 release
[14:04:46] <iamak[m]> gtlsgamr: Yeah ik
[14:05:03] <iamak[m]> I don't even want 120+ fps xD
[14:05:08] <iamak[m]> I am happy with 60
[14:05:23] <gtlsgamr> ekjactly
[14:05:30] <gtlsgamr> anyway i am off to get kirana 
[14:05:31] <gtlsgamr> so bye

[14:37:36] <gtlsgamr> not on irc it doesn't XD
[15:08:10] <Abhi[m]12> Hi
[15:27:27] <NeoVoid[m]1> Does anyone knows cli color picker?
[15:30:04] * NeoVoid[m]1 uploaded an image: (43KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/t2bot.io/eb7591e5c88213558ccd83b0c8725390c0e165a1/image.jpeg >
[15:30:05] <NeoVoid[m]1> @pystardust I just discovered the could be best color scheme for gli site
[15:33:46] <ramram[m]> <NeoVoid[m]1> "Does anyone knows cli color..." <- Install colorpicker and then make a script, add a keybind
[15:33:46] <ramram[m]> colorpicker --short --one-shot --preview | tr -d '\n' |  xclip -selection clipboard
[15:34:36] <NeoVoid[m]1> * @pystardust @gtlsgamr I just
[15:48:47] <AryaK[m]> xcolor
[15:48:50] <AryaK[m]> is what i use
[15:48:56] <AryaK[m]> very simple and feature rich
[15:49:24] <gtlsgamr> NeoVoid[m]1: I think gli site is dead
[15:49:26] <gtlsgamr> no contributions
[15:55:43] <NeoVoid[m]1> its not dead it just too complicated to contribute for the nubes like me.
[15:56:18] *** Guest2331 is now known as ramram-
[15:56:34] <NeoVoid[m]1> if it just a simple html and css instad of buildshit stuff we could have gain more contributors easily
[15:57:33] <gtlsgamr> okay i get it
[15:57:36] <gtlsgamr> makes sense
[15:57:39] <gtlsgamr> what do u suggest 
[15:57:41] <gtlsgamr> imporovement?
[15:57:53] <NeoVoid[m]1> just remove hugo shit
[15:58:12] <NeoVoid[m]1> and make it use simple html and css
[15:58:48] <NeoVoid[m]1> or if you want to keep using hugo just post an article about how to edit site step by step
[15:59:32] <AryaK[m]> yeah hugo is too much
[15:59:46] <AryaK[m]> also pystardust think we should move gli site to codeberg pages
[15:59:49] <AryaK[m]> from your vps
[16:04:05] <NeoVoid[m]1> but can we really trust codeberg or github like site with traffic data?
[16:10:18] <gtlsgamr> have u heard about pmwiki? google it
[16:14:25] <AryaK[m]> <NeoVoid[m]1> "but can we really trust codeberg..." <- github probably not
[16:14:33] <AryaK[m]> codeberg has to follow GDPR and stuff
[16:14:38] <AryaK[m]> so probably we can
[16:15:14] <AryaK[m]> ig we can use wikimedia thing 
[16:15:23] <AryaK[m]> forgot its name
[18:30:53] <Aaron[m]12> <NeoVoid[m]1> "and make it use simple html..." <- Wait what in Hugo one have to just add one markdown file for a new post but in simple html one will have to manually edit html with all tags
[18:34:40] <AryaK[m]> simple html means a script that compiles markdown to html usually
[18:37:48] <NeoVoid[m]1> <Aaron[m]12> "Wait what in Hugo one have to..." <- thats why we need a tutorial page or something
