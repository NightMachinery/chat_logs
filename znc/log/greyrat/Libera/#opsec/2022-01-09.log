[04:31:34] <Joanna> jan6: I still don’t get why people like Facebook so much. It doesn’t seem like a good place to meet new people.
[04:31:50] <jan6> that's exactly why
[04:32:01] <jan6> it's a good place to meet old people *badum tss*
[04:32:26] <JimBuntu> lolz
[04:32:35] <JimBuntu> Hiya Joanna ! /me waves
[04:33:01] <Joanna> I looked up some people I used to know in there but that’s pretty useless
[04:33:11] <Joanna> Hi JimBuntu what’s new?
[04:33:11] <JimBuntu> Joanna: Do ya eat pork?
[04:33:14] <jan6> more seriously, it's MEANT for stuff like "what's my old classmate up to these days" and "any events near me?" and "any groups for X?"
[04:33:18] <Joanna> Yes
[04:33:24] <Joanna> Why?
[04:33:32] <JimBuntu> https://i.imgur.com/2qGLolB.jpg then you can have one of these plates, Jan gets the other one ;p
[04:33:34] <jan6> it's not meant for meeting new people, although it works alright
[04:34:00] <JimBuntu> Jan, there is plenty, feel free to get seconds and thirds
[04:34:42] <Joanna> It’s been a long time since I’ve had a good sandwich. No whole wheat bread around here...
[04:35:16] <JimBuntu> That there Joanna , is pork shoulder I cooked for 7 hours... bread I made in the same time and cucumber salad that took about 2 hours
[04:35:43] <Joanna> jan6: my old boyfriends Facebook page had old pictures on it for some reason. Unless he hasn’t aged..
[04:36:07] <jan6> or, updated ;P
[04:36:25] <JimBuntu> meh Joanna , the only time we dudes like time passing is when it includes holding a tape measure, you know what I mean
[04:36:29] <jan6> if there's no need to update stuff, some people just don't ;P
[04:36:51] <JimBuntu> My facebook is very, very old. No updates in a long time... 
[04:36:55] <jan6> lol
[04:37:10] <Joanna> JimBuntu: last time I made a pork shoulder roast the scapula was same size as human scapula I sort of felt like a cannibal...
[04:37:23] <jan6> I pretty much exclusively use facebook for group chats with classmates or other such groups
[04:37:39] <jan6> and even that is just Messenger
[04:37:44] <JimBuntu> Joanna, that is literally what wifey#1 and I were JUST talking about... HUGE shoulder blades, lol
[04:37:51] <Joanna> I want nothing to do with old classmates
[04:37:58] <jan6> or current ones?
[04:37:59] <jan6> ;P
[04:38:22] <Joanna> There are no current ones.
[04:38:55] <jan6> I don't go around leaving old chats or anything, but the point is keeping up with happenings of some groups, where sometimes there's pretty important and/or useful info, which I wouldn't get otherwise
[04:39:10] <Joanna> I would like to create a chat system but I don’t have the skill
[04:39:23] <jan6> why create yet ANOTHER chat system?
[04:39:46] <jan6> there's plenty already, like signal, session, xmpp, etc etc
[04:40:00] <Joanna> Because a chat system that does what I want does not exist. Why else?
[04:40:10] <jan6> what does it need to do?
[04:40:13] <Joanna> Those are garbage
[04:40:45] <Joanna> I need it to connect strangers in an intelligent manner
[04:41:06] <jan6> "intelligent" manner?
[04:42:34] <Joanna> Yea
[04:42:57] <jan6> wdym?
[04:43:15] <jan6> IRC is pretty great at that, imho
[04:43:22] <JimBuntu> is it Machine Learning time?
[04:43:51] <Joanna> Not really irc connects with a lot of unsuitable people
[04:44:13] <jan6> not really
[04:44:24] <JimBuntu> I'm quite unsuitable, yet I enjoy talking with you 98.7257% of the time
[04:44:29] <jan6> ^
[04:44:47] * JimBuntu quacks
[04:44:48] <jan6> it's literally impossible to avoid "unsuitable people" without analyzing everyone's behaviour and preferences and tolerances
[04:44:59] <Joanna> I would like to be able to open an app with a million users and only be connected to the best ones for me.
[04:45:13] <jan6> you'd need to do what I just said ;P
[04:45:14] <JimBuntu> That's a low bar Joanna 
[04:45:43] <jan6> for example, I've been g-lined (banned) from a pretty nice network, which aims to be inclusive and whatnot, because they find me "unsuitable"
[04:46:20] <jan6> (after like 3 or 4 years, where I get banned like once a year for accidentally offending someone)
[04:46:20] <jan6> lol
[04:46:33] <jan6> (but now it's permaban)
[04:46:43] <Joanna> I don’t really like the term unsuitable I think everyone has soulmates that they can relate to.
[04:46:44] <JimBuntu> Feb7?
[04:46:52] <jan6> of course
[04:47:11] <jan6> the problem is that you liking someone might well not be mutual ;P
[04:47:21] <Joanna> jan6: how did you offend them?
[04:47:37] <JimBuntu> Joanna, I think WE are soul mates, just a bit less than 1:1 but more than 2:1
[04:48:18] <JimBuntu> I'm not nearly ready
[04:48:45] <JimBuntu> nota bella, I'm not being an ass, I'm being serious here
[04:48:50] <jan6> this last time was with pronouns, where a bot has functionality to set your preferred pronouns, and mine were "he/him they/them tree/trim en/nui" (where I actually do somewhat relate to trees), and I asked if I had to remove "tree/trim" too, and they got mad, lol
[04:49:02] <Joanna> I think each user should have a custom list of people they connect to. All the other users of network would not exist for them.
[04:49:24] <jan6> that's called ignoring
[04:49:56] <jan6> just make an invite-only channel and make invite exceptions for your friends
[04:49:57] <JimBuntu> Joanna, about 30 years ago I was part of a system called Dearborn connection that connected users with others who matches them based o a very long survey
[04:50:00] <jan6> ez
[04:50:05] <JimBuntu> I think what you are talking about is akin to that
[04:50:12] <Joanna> Ignoring should be a last resort. I’d rather not meet them to begin with
[04:50:38] <jan6> there's literally no way to meet new people without meeting some that you don't like
[04:50:38] <JimBuntu> The time I speak of was back in the era of dial up
[04:50:50] <Joanna> JimBuntu: was it successful?
[04:51:05] <JimBuntu> yes Joanna , very much so... at least for me and many others
[04:51:49] <jan6> even if they answer the questions in a way to fit your "profile", you're either gonna have no matches, and therefore nobody coming back, or you're gonna match with some people who you, at some point of time, will not want to talk to
[04:51:53] <JimBuntu> peter who ran it, had 60 modems and dial up lines and many computers to match.. the system was tied into a larger one via what passed as high speed internet for the time (DSL)
[04:52:21] <jan6> "Dearborn is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. "
[04:52:22] <jan6> lol
[04:52:27] <Joanna> It’s fairly easy to match people by opinions or interests but that’s not the route I would take. Opinions and interests are for secondary filtering
[04:52:29] <JimBuntu> We had 10s of thousands of users in the region... lots of matches... although, the system was playable... I played it quite a bit with lots if accounts
[04:52:46] <JimBuntu> Exactly jan6 , I'm from there... well nearby, Detroit
[04:53:30] <JimBuntu> Do you know of Detroit, jan6 ?
[04:54:13] <Joanna> JimBuntu: what kind of criterion was matching done by ?
[04:54:15] <jan6> only because of "detroit: become human" >;P
[04:54:40] <JimBuntu> Joanna, the questinioare has maybe 300 questions, it was similar to an Orion test
[04:54:54] <jan6> also I have a cheap-azz tablet that's branded by "Denver", lolol
[04:55:01] <Joanna> I don’t know what that is
[04:55:13] <JimBuntu> Denver is really far from Detroit, like maybe 1.25 Europes
[04:56:18] <jan6> lol
[04:56:20] <Joanna> Detroit is where they used to make cars
[04:56:36] <JimBuntu> We still make cars... many of them, but more so Engines.
[04:56:39] <jan6> I don't know usa, and I don't give the slightest s**t about it ;P
[04:56:46] <JimBuntu> lolz jan6 
[04:56:52] <Joanna> jan6: needs to study google maps :)
[04:57:19] <Joanna> jan6: what country are you ?
[04:57:29] <jan6> haven't I already told you
[04:57:35] <JimBuntu> Westonia! duh! j/k
[04:57:41] <Joanna> Finland?
[04:57:52] <jan6> close, but no
[04:58:05] <Joanna> You can pm me if it’s secret
[04:58:19] <jan6> 2021-10-27 18:10:39 Joanna jan6: are you in Scandinavia?
[04:58:20] <jan6> 2021-10-27 18:10:53 jan6 Estonia, so not far
[04:58:26] <jan6> not even that long ago
[04:58:27] <jan6> lol
[04:59:01] <JimBuntu> I am still intrigued by your land jan6 , I will visit
[04:59:07] <jan6> it's awesome
[04:59:59] <JimBuntu> I must wait for all of these crotch goblins to mature first, then... visit
[05:01:36] <Joanna> Oh I don’t know much about Estonia besides they are blonde and hate Russians ?
[05:01:59] <JimBuntu> Speaking of... I am being called away. chat ya later... love ya biab
[05:02:15] <jan6> well, hate mostly because soviet times were preeety recent, and soviets did their best to erase the culture of EVERYONE they invaded
[05:02:26] <Joanna> JimBuntu: I don’t think there will be too much international travel in future.
[05:02:35] <jan6> sure will be
[05:02:40] *** Joins: genera (~Genera@user/genera)
[05:02:42] <jan6> not TOO much
[05:02:44] <jan6> but enough ;P
[05:03:11] <Joanna> The culture of japan is being erased as we speak
[05:03:15] <jan6> also no more blonde than any other nordic or scandinavian country
[05:03:30] <jan6> how so, Joanna
[05:03:41] <Joanna> Actually every county’s culture is being erased
[05:03:50] <jan6> they're willingly westernizing, not erasing
[05:03:56] <jan6> it's called globalization
[05:04:06] <jan6> everyone's adapting everything from others
[05:04:28] <Joanna> jan6: you name it. Language, religion,clothing,food,architecture, toilets
[05:04:46] <jan6> but how so, with any sort of sources or examples?
[05:04:52] <Joanna> All being replaced with western garbage.
[05:05:28] <Joanna> Kimonos were replaced with ugly western clothing
[05:05:43] <jan6> you could just as well say that the west is becoming more japanese, due to all the anime influence, and quick-eat crappy ramen and whatnot ;P
[05:05:53] <jan6> uh, that's the same in the west
[05:06:01] <Joanna> Buildings replaced by ugly modernist buildings
[05:06:21] <jan6> like, how many people do you see walking around in full on suits and tophats, or fancy dresses and decorative gloves?
[05:06:27] <jan6> etc etc
[05:06:29] <Joanna> Language is full of English words
[05:07:00] <jan6> the only way to prevent this, is to go full nationalist, and limit external communications and media ;P
[05:07:23] <jan6> most of the borrowed words tend to be for things that don't already have a word natively
[05:07:58] <jan6> e.g. "computer" to refer to computing device, is often more sensible than use the native "one who computes" word
[05:08:17] <jan6> or "internet"
[05:08:52] <Joanna> They have gotten rid of most of their festivals. And have endless propaganda about nonsense that encourages them to get rid of their culture.
[05:09:08] <jan6> uh, where do you see any propaganda or advertisments for that?
[05:09:20] <jan6> because mostly, it's all natural
[05:09:42] <jan6> there's just globally less and less traditions and non-capitalist stuff
[05:09:43] <Joanna> Everywhere is adverts about the pretendemic
[05:09:49] <jan6> less faith worldwide
[05:10:02] <jan6> pretendemic what
[05:10:31] <Joanna> You haven’t noticed?
[05:10:56] <jan6> noticed what
[05:11:14] <Joanna> I refer you to the Corbett report in topic
[05:12:05] <jan6> I can't eat a website whole
[05:12:51] <Joanna> Podcast part
[05:13:19] <jan6> which of the hundreds
[05:13:44] <Joanna> Start with most recent work backwards
[05:14:04] <Joanna> Or actually maybe start in 2020
[05:14:26] <jan6> i still can't eat a website whole
[05:14:49] <jan6> every single episode is like 2-ish hours
[05:15:24] <jan6> it's already too late, anyway
[05:16:12] <Joanna> Well pick the ones that have most interesting titles :)
[05:16:27] <jan6> also, https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-corbett-report/
[05:16:28] <Joanna> Listen to one per day :)
[05:16:29] <jan6> lol
[05:17:01] <Joanna> Yea he has a podcast about fact checkers
[05:17:41] <jan6> from the first minute or so from the first video listed, the permaculture stuff, plus looking at some of the headlines, it's VERY clear that this is specifically for people who want someone to reinforce their suspicions that everyone is lying
[05:17:46] <jan6> there may be SOME truth
[05:17:52] <jan6> but it's not ENTIRELY truth
[05:18:38] <jan6> and several hours of podcasts, are way too intensive things to shift through, to figure out how true, if at all, they are
[05:18:52] <Joanna> So you haven’t listened to his podcasts?
[05:19:15] <Joanna> They are the best podcasts I’ve ever heard
[05:19:19] <jan6> like of COURSE mainstream media has an agenda, but so does this guy, namely providing exact opposite
[05:20:18] <Joanna> You haven’t listened to two years of podcasts and already have decided you don’t like him ?
[05:21:37] <jan6> no, I decided that it's not worth it, because it's too hard to process, if I want to do anything else other than specifically listen to him, attentively
[05:21:47] <Joanna> Who do you think owns fact-check websites ?
[05:22:08] <jan6> some random dude
[05:22:16] <jan6> just like any other non-corporate website
[05:22:49] <Joanna> I guess it’s hard to process if English isn’t your native language. He probably has written articles too.
[05:23:14] <jan6> it has viewer rating submission, plus it points out what articles have made them consider it to be the rating that it is
[05:23:28] <jan6> no, I mean hard as in time intensive
[05:23:34] <Joanna> The fact checkers are for gullible people:)
[05:23:58] <jan6> uh, no, the fact checkers are for people who don't want to spend days face checking everything themselves
[05:24:16] <jan6> or at least don't want to do that for every single website, but rather want a basis, first
[05:25:44] <jan6> it's the same as with e.g. video ratings, the fact that more people hate the video than love it, doesn't mean that you should avoid it, but it does mean you should take it with some scepticism as it might be full of nonsense, but also the contrary is NOT true, the fact that something is liked, does NOT mean it IS true
[05:25:49] <jan6> same with fact checkers
[05:26:38] <jan6> if they say something is good, then it may or may not be, but if they say it's bad, then it more than likely is, at least partially
[05:26:59] <Joanna> Fact checkers are not trustworthy. I’m disappointed that you favor their opinions over mine.
[05:27:13] <jan6> it's not their opinions
[05:27:20] <jan6> it's my opinion based on headlines
[05:27:27] <jan6> it's "alternate" to be sure
[05:27:41] <jan6> but I don't agree with a lot of your views either, as you may or may not have noticed
[05:29:01] <jan6> e.g. "school is prison, and everyone must go to school", while it's very possible to set up homeschooling in most of usa (and with enough research and effort, probably also doable in other countries, usa just has the most easily available resources about it), or the classic ACAB stance
[05:29:36] <jan6> I'm not saying that I care for traditional news either, really
[05:29:50] <jan6> I don't care for ANY specific news
[05:30:52] <jan6> but the more traditional-ish sort of news, tend to report on facts, like "this happened", not "when they introduced fingerprint requirement, I was very alarmed"
[05:31:08] <Joanna> Sure if you don’t have idiot parents who send you to school to be punched in the face school is no problem at all.
[05:31:37] <jan6> focusing on emotions over facts, is very widely common control method, used by religions, cults, dictators, and many others
[05:32:06] <jan6> well, your problem is being in a place where getting punched in your face is acceptable at all
[05:32:12] <jan6> to anyone
[05:32:23] <Joanna> News media uses emotions all the time
[05:32:28] <jan6> sure
[05:32:53] <jan6> everyone does
[05:33:38] <jan6> even scientific papers are often not presented in completely objective way
[05:34:44] <jan6> but at least they don't start off with "dude became self sufficient, had a dream that forest burned along with his house, and went to town teaching people about it"

[05:51:32] <jan6> this is a song I really like: https://lyricstranslate.com/en/billeon-villain.html-0
[05:51:33] <SeaDough> ^ Stella Jang - 빌런 (Villain) (billeon) lyrics + English translation
[05:52:41] <jan6> which includes parts, such as "Someone that i love unconditionally is treated like a dog somewhere else. (say)"
[05:52:51] <jan6> (translated)
[05:53:11] <jan6> and
[05:53:13] <jan6> Are we good? Are we bad? (ay)
[05:53:14] <jan6> What is good? What is bad? (ay)
[05:53:24] <jan6> and "We all pretend to be the heroes on the good side.We all pretend to be the heroes on the good side."
[05:53:30] <jan6> (double-paste)
[05:53:44] <jan6> which is all very true
[05:54:01] <jan6> what is a villain for one, is a friend, or hero, to another
[05:54:38] <jan6> but everyone pushes their views as the "right one"
[05:55:38] <Joanna> Good and evil are opinions
[05:55:43] <jan6> exactly
[05:55:48] <jan6> and the same is with news
[05:56:26] <jan6> ultimately, everything is relative, always
[05:57:21] <Joanna> Look what they have accomplished so far since tv was invented..
[05:57:28] <jan6> even terry prachett has commented through his stories, such as https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/66591-all-right-said-susan-i-m-not-stupid-you-re-saying-humans
[05:57:30] <SeaDough> ^ Quote by Terry Pratchett: “All right," said Susan. "I'm not stupid. You're...”
[05:57:56] <jan6> pretty good quote, and well known
[05:59:06] <Joanna> Fantasies can lead to disaster
[05:59:15] <jan6> fantasies are what makes humans human
[05:59:21] <jan6> ANYTHING can lead to disaster
[05:59:42] <jan6> well, not anything, strictly, but any little thing, can culminate in a huge thing
[05:59:49] <jan6> the butterfly effect, yada yada
[05:59:55] <Joanna> Fantasy is a symptom of a greater problem
[06:00:35] <Joanna> Best solve the actual problem
[06:00:57] <jan6> e.g. one guy can write a book about how rich people should give their money to him, and inspired by that, after a revolution, this is pushed to be the new order of a massive "country"
[06:01:13] <jan6> the problem is sentience, Joanna 
[06:01:29] <jan6> if you're not part of a hivemind, if you have any agency, you can cause trouble
[06:01:42] <jan6> be it intentional or not, you can ruin the efforts of hundreds, even accidentally
[06:02:19] <Joanna> Example?
[06:08:10] <Joanna> So far as I can tell the same families of rich people have been controlling things since who knows when. But nowadays they use proxies.
[06:08:52] <jan6> too broad, can't slice up infinity, lol, e.g. on a smaller scale, say, you're building a statue (say, the one for a sort of festival or something, made of thatch or planks or sticks or whatever it is)... push a stick too hard, pull a string at the wrong angle, and it can all collapse... or maybe, say, after a hard day making haybales, you set up a campfire to enjoy the summer night and relax... say
[06:08:52] <jan6> someone gets drunk, and is being annoying, and trying to comraderie hug you, and you push them away... they could stumble too close to the fire, have clothes catch fire, and in their panic ignite the hay you worked so hard to collect... etc etc
[06:09:11] <jan6> rich people used proxies all the time, back in time, too, lol
[06:10:35] <jan6> like what, you think the king would directly administer the entire kingdom? no way, he got others to do it for him, but if the others weren't willing to do what he wanted, they didn't live for long
[06:11:02] <jan6> (same all the way down)
[06:11:59] <jan6> all power structures work through delegation, and information is also best gathered, and spread, through delegation
[06:12:32] <jan6> instead of you trying to find out every piece of news, you'd just ask everyone if anything new has happened
[06:13:18] <jan6> instead of trying to crush your rival yourself, it's more effective to gather some others to help you with it, potentially giving you ideas you wouldn't think of yourself
[06:13:26] <jan6> etc etc
[06:14:45] <jan6> especially because through spreading out like that, you're far more likely to get/do stuff that would be unlikely, or impossible, otherwise
[06:15:49] <jan6> e.g. by going through other people as proxies, asking "anyone who can help me get an interview with X person who never gives interviews" might well net you some friend-of-a-friend-of-a-friend-of-a-friend's-uncle who happens to have good relations to the person
[06:17:07] <jan6> in the end, it's likely most of the people don't know "jan6 wants an interview with X", but rather "a friend of a friend of mine wants to interview X"
[06:18:33] * jan6 off
[06:19:02] <jan6> it's late here

[15:02:41] <Joanna> jan6: the one person causing a lot of damage to on a small scale makes sense but I don’t think one person has any chance to stop billions of brainwashed zombies from doing foolish things.
