[00:03:33] <eXtr3m0> Wow yeah that seems crazy. much better to calculate a px value with js and apply it inline
[00:03:34] <arch> Gosh, that post really makes me think I should give browsers more credit
[00:03:34] <arch> I'll still respect calc() and not overuse it, but this is extremely encouraging

[00:05:30] <eXtr3m0> But yeah then again this is 5 years old.
[00:06:09] <arch> Mhm! It's also using JS to set CSS, which means that comparisons to computing things in JS might be a bit unfair
[00:06:30] <arch> But the variables in those iterations are actually a lot more performant that I was worried they would be--even five years ago
[00:06:44] <arch> s/variables/cals/
[00:06:52] <arch> calcs even
[00:08:50] <arch> Even the slowest in the screenshot is over 2000 operations per second (Meaning 1 would be cost half a millisecond), and that's including the part where they are updating the objects in JS with new style attributes, which already has performance implications
[00:09:58] <eXtr3m0> I find them most handy in regards of responsiveness for the layout and for little details
[00:10:05] <arch> Me too!

[00:20:53] <arch> alystair: Heck yeah! That's how I write most of the things where that can make sense
[00:21:42] <arch> Like, usually a class API where throwing a class on certain elements gives it a certain piece of behavior, and all of the visual parts of it are handled with CSS

[00:25:17] <arch> So like, giving a normal input a .calendarPlz class will turn it into a clickable thing that pops up a calendar
[00:25:18] <arch> Or .delete on a link will make it request a data attribute on it with a delete request
[00:25:18] <arch> .careful makes a confirmation pop up before doing other logic
[00:25:18] <arch> etc...
[00:25:21] <arch> All of this stuff has visual details, but if I just use those same classes, it's easy enough to just make those appear correctly no matter where I do those things
[00:25:49] <alystair> I went a step beyond and created negation logic
[00:26:04] <arch> It means that like, 40% of the time when I need to implement something new, all I need to do is just write a little bit of HTML and give them some classes

[07:24:30] <dragoonEarth> I've got a javascript question, In Chrome Dev-tools console, it's allowing me to access my function or variables outside of their scope (for example, I can access functions or variables declared with let or const outside a function).
[07:25:26] <matsaman> ?
[07:25:32] <dragoonEarth> For example, the output of this https://gist.github.com/victorfeight/eb35734a0fd96df612958c8df284d8d0  in Devtools console is 1, whereas in RunJS or JS-Fiddle (or firefox dev console) it's correctly "f is undefined". I'm wondering if this is an optimization or something in chrome

[07:26:17] <matsaman> dev tools are not reality
[07:26:31] <matsaman> doesn't mean you aren't misunderstanding something, but they're not reality
[07:26:56] <systemfault> "f" is simply not accessible.

[07:28:31] <dragoonEarth> yea...the "dev tools is not a reality" makes sense lol. Reason I'm asking is I was watching a video on closures and chrome devtools console output was not aligning to the video
[07:29:02] <matsaman> that could also just be bad/lazy/sloppy video editing
[07:29:14] <matsaman> very common with video tutelage
[07:29:23] <matsaman> because it's an extremely inefficient way to convey most information
[07:29:32] <matsaman> and takes a ton of work to make a polished end result
[07:29:49] <matsaman> and then _on top of that_, someone instructors are just dumb and full of crap
[07:29:53] <matsaman> sometimes*
[07:33:33] <dragoonEarth> Yea, sometimes there are inaccuracies or outdated informations. To make my question more clear, I uploaded the output from RunJS vs Chrome devtools with the same code. It's funny because Chrome can access the block-scoped 'i' value, but RunJS (using Node I believe) correctly shows a reference error.

[10:08:37] <dragoonEarth> oscurochu, thank you. After fiddling I realized I have to reload the page so the scoped variables get reset in the Devtools console. This corrected my scoping issue. And as you mentioned, to observe a closure I had to add a reference. Nicely, Chrome does show that my closure is observed now.

[14:39:05] <vladoski> If I change them quite fast, my frontend queries the api two times and first shows one result and then refreshes with the other one
[14:39:20] <vladoski> is there a pattern or something that I can use? How can I approach this problem?
[14:39:30] <RLa> you could try to use lodash throttle or debounce method
[14:39:50] <RLa> you have to think whether you want throttle or debounce
[14:39:56] <RLa> they are different
[14:40:11] <RLa> you probably want "last update wins" type of solution
[14:40:19] <vladoski> RLa exactly
[14:40:37] <vladoski> okay let me see the difference between them
[14:40:39] <vladoski> thanks

[14:43:51] <Intelo> RLa I see so I do not need vm2 or isolatevm kind of libs? node.js can do it out of the box?
[14:44:11] <vladoski> RLa, okay so debounce is what I need
[14:45:02] <RLa> Intelo, no, you probably still need isolation libs to restrict filesystem or network access

[17:28:41] <jaawerth> hmm ok, you might want to try this one too if you're ok getting this info in reaction to input
[17:28:47] <jaawerth> !mdn getTargetRanges
[17:28:48] <jellobot> jaawerth, getTargetRanges() method of the InputEvent interface returns an array of static ranges that will be affected by a change to the DOM if the input event is not canceled. https://mdn.io/getTargetRanges
[17:29:23] <jaawerth> the range api is a pain and I hven't used it a whole lot but that seems to be generally for that sort of purpose ^

[18:32:50] <austincheney> I have limited experience with search, but I have learned that I can search the file system using JavaScript, even from an interface in the browser, orders of magnitude faster than the OS using the OS's native conventions
[18:33:26] <austincheney> I believe, and I could be wrong, is that OS search supports legacy conventions, like wildcards, that are slow

[18:34:40] <undefined_bob> well, I'm not really experienced in search engines too. But I think the search must search the html file on the server for the search value and then show the results somehow
[18:35:54] <austincheney> undefined_bob, HTML, as a file is a big string.  That said you have two search options:  string search or parse the string into something like else like a DOM tree and then traverse the tree nodes
[18:37:25] <undefined_bob> hm most stuff inside the html is in <table>

[19:20:31] <mknod> On such a cell, range.getValue().toString() returns "CellImage", but this test alone doesn't seem very reliable.
[19:21:14] <mknod> Object.prototype.toString.call(range.getValue()) returns "[object Object]". I would have expected "[object CellImage]" but I must be missing something.
[19:22:02] <mknod> I would prefer to use instanceof as it seems to be the most elegant and reliable solution, but I had no luck so far.
[19:24:04] <mknod> range.getValue() instanceof SpreadsheetApp.newCellImage().toBuilder().build especially, returns false. I just can't find the right hand side of instanceof that will allow me to perform that test.

[22:08:23] <ljharb> !iterations @ minnow
[22:08:23] <jellobot> minnow, ECMAScript's Array contains a number of built-in methods for iteration (e.g., map, reduce, every, some, filter, and forEach). They relieve the need for manual iteration, provide better abstraction than a `for` loop, and make it clear what your iteration is doing.

[22:31:34] <PenguinMan98> If you have a dynamic list without a key though, then the component structure changes and if one of the items kicks off a render, the structure can't tell which one did it and should be updated, so it has to render them all. This slows things down. Not ideal. Also, if you have code that inserts or reorders that list and you don't have keys, its
