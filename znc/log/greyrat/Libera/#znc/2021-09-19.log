[02:46:52] <nuke> hey all, im getting this <*status> Cannot connect to IRC (Failed to setup bind host). Retrying...
[02:47:10] <MetaNova> do: '/msg *status clearbindhost' and '/msg *status clearuserbindhost'
[02:47:16] <nuke> weird thing is i added some ipv6 and only 2 or 3 worked
[02:47:35] <nuke> can this be something znc related or just my vps messing up
[02:48:06] <MetaNova> it binds to an address if it can find it, even if it's not routable
[02:48:27] <MetaNova> if it fails to set up the bindhost it's because ZNC doesn't see it as owned by the machine it's running on
[02:48:46] <nuke> what would fix that, a sytem reboot?
[02:48:50] <nuke> i tried that didnt work
[02:48:52] <MetaNova> see above
[02:48:56] <MetaNova> do: '/msg *status clearbindhost' and '/msg *status clearuserbindhost'
[02:49:08] <nuke> i did and set the one i wanted again but didnt work
[02:49:12] <MetaNova> if the IP allocation/routing is broken on your system, there's nothing ZNC can do about it
[02:49:30] <nuke> ok, so definitly not znc problem then, ok tyvm :)
[02:49:41] <MetaNova> did you just .. malform the IP? do showbindhost
[02:50:06] <MetaNova> (/msg *status showbindhost)
[02:50:12] <nuke> yea i double check i cleared set again cleared and nothing works
[02:50:19] <nuke> and other i did just the same works
[02:50:25] <nuke> thats what its messing my head lol
[02:50:47] <nuke> they both seem ok rdns and stuff so confused
[02:51:27] <MetaNova> so do a tracert or ping and specify the address to bind to
[02:51:41] <MetaNova> or try pinging those IPs from a different host
[02:51:45] <MetaNova> like your home connection
[02:53:16] <nuke> weird doesnt ping even the one thats working
[02:53:22] <MetaNova> nuke: are you specifying a domain or an IP?
[02:53:51] <nuke> im creating a AAAA record on my domain cpanel to a ipv6 ip
[02:54:03] <MetaNova> try specifying the actual address
[02:54:14] <nuke> and also added on the vps /etc/hosts that have the ip
[02:54:29] <MetaNova> so
[02:54:29] *** Quits: DiffieHellman (~Username@user/curve25519chacha) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:54:31] *** Joins: Strom (strom@fedora/strom)
[02:54:33] <MetaNova> let me get this straight
[02:54:38] <nuke> ping the ipv6 instead of the AAAA record
[02:54:47] <MetaNova> you're creating an AAAA record and and an /etc/hosts entry?
[02:54:57] <MetaNova> and you think that will assign an IP address to your VPS?
[02:55:03] *** Joins: DiffieHellman (~Username@user/curve25519chacha)
[02:56:43] <nuke> let me try to explain see if u see the problem, VPS1 has the znc with 1 ipv4 and some ipv6, VPS2 my domain with a cpanel, i create the AAAA record on VPS2 (my domain) and on the crontrol panel that the VPS1 provided to create the ipv6 i added the ipv6 and corresponding AAAA to it
[02:56:58] <nuke> and also added it in the /etc/hosts manually thinking it was the problem
[02:57:09] <nuke> what im doing worn gin all this
[02:57:54] <nuke> (/etc/hosts on the VPS1)
[02:58:02] <DarthGandalf> do you see this ip in output of 'ip a'?
[02:58:10] <MetaNova> 'ip addr show'
[02:58:54] <MetaNova> the IP in question needs to _at least_ appear in that output ^ for ZNC to bind to it
[02:58:56] <nuke> hmm i see some, not all that i setted
[02:59:04] <MetaNova> let alone for it to be able to connect to any IRC server from it
[02:59:35] <DarthGandalf> that is where you need to add them
[02:59:43] <DarthGandalf> /etc/hosts is mostly irrelevant
[02:59:47] <nuke> oh so prolly just takes some time to "appear" or should i redo the ones that didnt set
[03:00:03] <DarthGandalf> I really doubt it's about some delay
[03:00:15] <DarthGandalf> unless this cpanel is doing something very strange
[03:00:29] <MetaNova> I also doubt it's any sort of delay
[03:00:53] <MetaNova> IP application/specification/deployment/whatever should be near instant
[03:01:27] <MetaNova> the machine is either assigned/assigns itself an IP or it doesn't
[03:01:55] <MetaNova> if you're following the correct steps as specified by your provider, open a support ticket
[03:02:16] <nuke> i guess i will just redo all the adding of the ones that didnt for some reason get assign see if goes this time, has some weirdly enough got setted 
[03:02:22] <MetaNova> if you haven't looked up their FAQ/KB, do so and see if they tell you what steps you need to take to add additional IP addresses to your server
[03:03:03] <nuke> they just provided the typical "network" "add" on their control panel
[03:03:18] <nuke> i went for manual adding on hosts cause i tought might be the problem
[03:03:25] <nuke> guess no
[03:03:29] <nuke> lol
[03:04:00] <MetaNova> the hosts file is basically irrelevant here
[03:04:37] <nuke> ok gonna try just the with their control panel and wait a bit see if it gets set
[03:04:43] <nuke> gonna try to add/remove troubleshoot see if i can come with some answers from it, tyvm for all the help even not being znc directly related

[18:01:47] <ZNC-Linker> BadKarma, when asking for help, be sure to provide as many details as possible: What did you try to do, how exactly did you try it (step by step), all error messages, ZNC version, bindhosts, etc. Without details, the only possible answer is 'BadKarma, you're doing something wrong.'
[18:04:30] <BadKarma> so if i use --network=container:gluetun does this mean i wouldnt be able to connect to it from a different computer locally? I've never readlly written a docker compose so i might have butchered this one -- https://pastebin.com/t919uLCp . so ideally i would want a znc for my irc that i can connect to locally, but i want to channel the znc through a vpn container (in this case gluetun). ZNC version latest 
[18:04:36] <BadKarma> from docker hub
[18:05:41] <BadKarma> i should also say that the host is my rpi, which is a local server
[18:09:40] *** Joins: woodwose (~woodwose@user/woodwose)
[18:16:17] <DarthGandalf> Do you expect gluetun to magically redirect everything in docker throught that vpn?
[18:18:43] <DarthGandalf> or what the issue is?
[18:27:05] <BadKarma> my devices > znc > gluetun > irc
[18:27:17] <BadKarma> i just want znc to listen locally 
[18:27:54] <BadKarma> with a vpn i wont have a static ip, so i would like to connect to znc then redirect all traffic through the vpn
[18:28:52] <BadKarma> so my issue is esentially how would i be able to connect to the znc container whilst it's taking its network from gluetun
