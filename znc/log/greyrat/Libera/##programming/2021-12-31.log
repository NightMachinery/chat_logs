[01:19:44] <[itchyjunk]> maybe that is something you want? styleGAN2, no anime chan
[01:19:46] <booplux> okay, gotcha
[01:20:49] <[itchyjunk]> so you retrain the discriminator with your flag stuff first
[01:21:13] <[itchyjunk]> then you do that loop in that image and some magic and linear algebra later, it should generate flag like things
[01:21:17] <mrig> seems that word works in that context.

[01:23:10] <booplux> sounds ominously simple [itchyjunk]
[01:23:36] <[itchyjunk]> booplux, the bigger picture is. most of the hardship comes from hyperparameter tuning

[01:25:58] <ProfSimm> mrig: what's an IEEE float? It's two integers forming a sum-product
[01:26:05] <ProfSimm> Mantissa and exponent.
[01:26:07] <ProfSimm> I mean...
[01:26:12] <booplux> in ML, does the math come in the form of plugging in formulas, or just understanding the concepts?

[01:26:50] <MsSmith> I just got first customer for my start up
[01:26:59] <[itchyjunk]> the calculus part just tells you that you can optimize a function

[01:27:01] <mrig> ProfSimm: Yes I remember that you mentioned this the other day, that it could be perceived as a 2D matix essentially.
[01:27:06] <Decker> mostly plugging formulas - libraries make it super easy to just put together a neural network without the first clue about their math
[01:27:07] <MsSmith> eaheuahe
[01:27:11] <[itchyjunk]> the linear algebra part tells you how to get the thing you want that you want to optimize
[01:27:21] <ProfSimm> booplux: you need to structure the features sometimes to help the neural network figure out what the problem parts are. But I wouldn't say it's about tons of formulas

[01:29:09] <MsSmith> most ML just solves the equation gradient(F) = 0 for some differentiable loss function F
[01:29:31] <MsSmith> not interesting or magic tbh
[01:29:55] <ProfSimm> mrig: only thing I don't know is if multiplication is actually the right operation, or something else. Because consider when two particles collide at some angle of incidence. Their product vector is... well, a product, but also it's trigonometry
[01:30:35] <ProfSimm> Multiplication may be just a handy approximation
[01:30:35] <Decker> it's product vectors - 1 for linear motion 1 for rotational
[01:30:41] <Decker> at least in like every physics engine
[01:31:16] <ProfSimm> Decker: neural networks also use a mapping function to map everything from 0...1 or -1...1, because your output may be way out of range
[01:31:28] <ProfSimm> Decker: basically like soft clamping the output
[01:31:38] <mrig> ProfSimm: particles are handy approximations :P
[01:31:45] <ProfSimm> Decker: and I wonder if that doesn't betray that multiplication is not the right operation
[01:31:54] <ProfSimm> It's some sort of product...
[01:32:23] <[itchyjunk]> product doesn't mean "multiplication"
[01:32:30] <[itchyjunk]> inner product is the generalization of dot product
[01:32:54] <[itchyjunk]> you're working in some inner product space (or a normed space?, can't remember).

[01:34:14] <ProfSimm> Another way that ANN differs from biological NN is that biological neurons spike and emit an impulse. Discretized. It doesn't have different strength of impulse to map to a different floating point value
[01:34:23] <mrig> semantic though really, the thought is not of the word but of what is apparently happening.

[01:35:07] <ProfSimm> There's no "potential", instead you use thresholds as a crude approximation.

[01:36:36] <ProfSimm> They say people work better on music, but learn better in silence. Because music synchronises the brain, and synchronous operation is better for "production" while asynchronous is better for "training"

[01:38:04] <ProfSimm> MsSmith: if implemented right a spiking neural network should use a lot less power though. But maybe it needs the right hardware.

[01:45:42] <nomagno> else, outta luck

[03:04:57] <pyzozord> There are some points of disorientation  in dyslexic brain. They serve as a mechanism to kind of do look at problems from different perspective. They trigger especially when something is confusing. This might be helpful to come up with different view points. But it also means that dyslectic must exert much more energy to power through that disorientation and stay focused on something linear or sequential

[14:35:12] <ProfSimm> Let's say we create a database where keys (primary and foreign) are opaque, like java object references. So you get a unique key, you don't see its contents, and you know its type (which table it came from). And you can use it as a foreign key. Is this better than using numbers/strings or worse in your opinion?

You need to manage a key to know if someone uses it. Because if it's just some number "567" you have no idea who has it and whether he uses it as a primary key to a specific table. It's just a number

[15:48:11] <mrig> ProfSimm #SQL are pretty helpful if you need assistance?
[15:48:28] <ProfSimm> Decker: well I've just been thinking, a graph is much better realized as a view of a specific relational structure. 
[15:48:55] <ProfSimm> Decker: consider how taxing it is to serialize a graph properly. Cycles and all.
[15:49:05] <Decker> it's pretty easy
[15:49:27] <ProfSimm> Decker: it's pretty easy if and only if you have a relational view of it, aka "nodes" and "edges". Two tables :P
[15:49:47] <ProfSimm> Decker: ;-)
[15:50:05] <Decker> ... a stack of things that have been serlized, and if they have, emit that reference

[15:50:20] <ProfSimm> Decker: yeah that stack is the actual problem

[15:50:29] <Decker> how is that a problem?
[15:50:37] <ProfSimm> Decker: imagine you gotta serialize the universe. You'll need a universe-sized stack
[15:51:01] <ProfSimm> Decker: on the contrary you need no stack at all to serialize two tables. Just a simple cursor to walk each row

[15:51:50] <ProfSimm> Well needing no stack is better than needing it
[15:52:11] <ProfSimm> Decker: in fact many graph databases store to disk as relations. The above two tables I mentioned
[15:52:53] <ProfSimm> Decker: it's much better for analysis too, and for storage and queries. You have data aligned by type in tables.
[15:53:50] <ProfSimm> I think the only issue with relational databases is that it's fixed to 2D tables (no need for that), and that primary/foreign keys are not encapsulated, they're naked numbers and text
[15:54:00] <ProfSimm> Fix that, and we have the ultimate paradigm
[15:54:16] <Decker> ProfSimm :) it's a graph database

[15:55:52] <ProfSimm> Decker: it's a mess

[16:07:52] <mrig> cool, sounds right up you street then :)
[16:08:21] <ProfSimm> Decker: as for graph databases already being in their store, well they're still serialized, and as noted, most graph databases tend to have relational storage of "nodes" and "edges"
[16:08:59] <Decker> nodes and nodes - edges are implied from the relations nodes have with other nodes but are not things themselves
[16:09:00] <ProfSimm> Decker: what we lack when we traverse a graph as a graph is an ordered set of edges.
[16:09:08] <Decker> if they were, they'd be a node, not an edge
[16:09:42] <Decker> I suppose it's ordered; that is it exists in an order
[16:09:44] <ProfSimm> Decker: and yet many graph database store edges separately. So worth a thought why they do this. Yes you can imagine them as implied. But they're very much their own thing in storage

[16:13:36] <ProfSimm> Decker: think about it like this. Say you need to hibernate your Java program. It's much easier to write down the RAM pages to disk, than to actually disentangle and serialize every individual object by traversing object references, I hope you see that.

[16:17:29] <ProfSimm> Decker: it's zero effort to project nodes/edges as a graph. It's a ton of effort, with a big stack, to project a graph to nodes/edges sets.

[16:45:10] <ProfSimm> Decker: there's no meaning to this hierarchy you've shown me. It's just happenstance based on how the graph was traversed "here's a tree of nodes before they repeated, after they repeated, they're ref[] links"
[16:45:27] *** Quits: va5c0 (~vasco.nun@31.127.137.56) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[16:45:27] <Decker> right
[16:45:31] <ProfSimm> Decker: when you encounted a repeat node is not a function of the graph, it's a function of how you traversed it. It's arbitrary
[16:45:35] <ProfSimm> Decker: it's not useful

[16:50:09] <nomagno> Though I forgot to configure rudder trim, so the prop spin was annoying as heck...
[16:51:30] <ProfSimm> Decker: another problem is that you gotta build the full graph before these refs[] can be tracked back in the other direction. In nodes/edges representation you could query both ways without loading the full graph. Just search a simple B-tree index directly on disk.
[16:51:41] *** Joins: mishugana (~mishugana@user/mishugana)
[16:52:41] <Decker> the refs are emitted serially in the place they are I have to build up to that point
[16:54:04] <Decker> https://gun.eco/docs/ some of that is just a matter of API.  The normal operation isn't to load the universe... when someone logs into a system you just need their user account, not everyone who's on their block
[16:54:17] <ProfSimm> My point is, if you have a "friend ref" on a person. Then you can only guarantee you see all friends when you build the full graph
[16:54:32] <ProfSimm> Given friendship is bidir especially
[16:55:06] <ProfSimm> Or if I can give a more clear example, if employee has "employer" refs, then the employer can only see their employees after you build the full graph
[16:55:20] <Decker> RIght - if you have a CTE query on key-value heirarchy in a database the same is true - without the full recordset you don't have all their friends
[16:55:22] *** Joins: k3nn7 (~k3nn7@109.197.175.182)
[16:55:49] <ProfSimm> The problem is you need to build the graph, not just have the recordset
[16:56:06] <ProfSimm> Or you need to materialize the relationship in both directions on disk
[16:56:15] <ProfSimm> "disk" is figurative here
[16:57:02] <ProfSimm> But if you wanna find a specific node it's again hard to do so if your graph representation is... graph-shaped
[16:57:13] <ProfSimm> You need to literally traverse your disk representation node by node, looking for John
[16:57:32] <ProfSimm> While a relational representation, I can just find "John" in a B-tree
[16:57:39] <ProfSimm> Then get all his friends
[16:57:45] <Decker> I can have a b-tree then too
[16:57:50] <ProfSimm> You can yes
[16:57:52] <Decker> and I have an index of users so when they login I can find 'john'
[16:58:08] <Decker> meanwhile he has many other relationships
[16:58:16] <ProfSimm> And then thing you have a B-tree *over* would be basically the relational representation of your data :P
[16:58:19] <Decker> that just exist and are not implied or projected
[16:58:23] <ProfSimm> A list of attributes on a list of entities
[16:58:47] <Decker> right - which is what databases do to be performant
[16:58:55] <ProfSimm> Well.
[16:59:10] <ProfSimm> My point is once you have that, you don't need another representation. It becomes redundant.
[16:59:16] <ProfSimm> Why repeat the data twice
[16:59:34] <Decker> so you don't have to look at all users to find john
[17:00:11] <ProfSimm> You didn't get me. Many DBs already represent their rows as B-tree on the PK
[17:00:13] <Decker> the btree is just another object in the graph

[17:02:12] <ProfSimm> I wouldn't put the b-tree as just another object in the graph. I mean you want a "single source of truth" in your data.
[17:02:22] <ProfSimm> From which to project views. And the index is a projected view.
[17:02:54] <Decker> anyway the point is - yes eventually at the 'quantum' level of the database it's bits on a disk and there's an index to those bits  (key-value)... sure; but really a much higher level is where it's more productive to think
[17:02:56] <ProfSimm> There needs to be some separation no. Like "this is derived" and "this is the actual thing we derived from"
[17:03:10] <Decker> and then if the bits just make that happen in a performant way? so much the better.
[17:03:45] <Decker> and the higher level emergant structures don't really care it's key-value
[17:03:49] <ProfSimm> Decker: well the key point was that sometimes you need a non-graph view of your data. Otherwise you're doomed to recreate it at your higher level. The way you may accidentally recreate a B-tree that's already a B-tree if you have no access to the B-Tree under

[17:05:17] <ProfSimm> You just gotta be able to open the hood and see what's in and use it as-is I think
[17:05:29] <ProfSimm> It has to be formalized, normalized and well-abstracted for regular use
[17:06:00] <ProfSimm> I think the idea of presenting things as dimensions works. I mean it works in statistics, in math.

[17:06:38] <Decker> sure - there's all sorts of dimensions like pressure, temperature, count of fuzzy bears on the shelf
[17:07:27] <ProfSimm> The trick is to make a system that self-organizes into orthogonal and composite dimensions. Without overlap.
[17:07:36] <ProfSimm> This would be a self-deduplicating dataset
[17:08:19] <Decker> my guy I worked with took my library and tinked with making a game like johnny appleseed.  Basically you'd have a cart you drove around, and it would drop 1 seed every once in a while all the time... he complained that it couldn't make more than 1000 buttons per second to represent the seeds... each individual seed has to become a object itself with a count of 1

[19:05:18] <Trashlord> if I'm iterating on a list, and I want to remove one item from it based on whether it exists, would you say it's good practice to break out of the iteration loop even if I know this particular item will only be found once in the list?

[21:32:19] <apotheon> Well . . . my investigations lead me to the idea that the generic equivalent of anthropomorphism would be metamorphism, but "metamorph" has very strong connotations as a loan word in English that might contradict that usage.
[21:32:26] <sonny> Decker interesting, I suspected so
[21:32:26] <apotheon> s/lead/leads/
[21:33:08] <apotheon> Polymorphism would suggest something has many forms, as opposed to being referenced by way of an alternate form.
[21:33:27] <sonny> I guess events is done at a lower level in windows, since according to a diagram win32 and uwp are seperate

[21:33:55] <apotheon> mrig: That probably doesn't help much, in that it basically says "nope, I don't see good Greek terms for this".
[21:34:16] <Decker> they are... at the lowest level it's while(GetMessage()) DispatchMessage(); sonny
[21:34:29] <Decker> then there's lots of layers on top fo that
[21:34:38] <sonny> one moment, I'll get the diagram
[21:36:55] <apotheon> Maybe something like ypokathistomorphism or antikathistomorphism would suit.
[21:37:20] <mrig> apotheon oh metamorphism is an interesting thought, the penny didn't drop there on first reading, I didn't recognise the word as I would have in another context. Metamorphosis does fit but is not in the correct grammatical tense perhaps, in the English useage?

[21:42:40] <Decker> in the way that it's based on that layer it's right.. and win32 ui is just one side - but there's arrrows that go up from pc to win32 to winrt too
[21:42:40] <mrig> apotheon Oh I was only asking as I used the word anthropomorphism the other day but it does not really fit when considering god to be a computer system.

[21:42:59] <Decker> but then UWP is really also on win32 at least a little

[23:20:42] <wuldor> Nope, I'm just aiming to be Allan Holdsworth no matter the cost.
[23:21:00] <pyzozord> I always feel I should because I don't have any understanding of how it actually is
[23:21:01] <apotheon> wuldor: That's a noble pursuit, if I don't take you literally.
[23:21:52] <apotheon> Neither "be Allan Holdsworth" nor "no matter the cost" should be literal, of course.
[23:23:28] <duuude> wuldor: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise-induced_hearing_loss
[23:23:30] <wuldor> You aware of Holdsworth?
[23:23:33] <mrig> pyzozord I do have a large marshal and a mesa guitar amp sat next to me, I am kind of tempted to warm them up and join in the fun.
[23:23:37] <apotheon> I should listen to some Allan Holdsworth soon, but I'm about to go to meatspace.
[23:23:40] <apotheon> wuldor: somewhat
[23:23:44] <duuude> wuldor: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbycusis
[23:24:15] <apotheon> The missus is on telephone call with her sister, so I'm temporarily trying to entertain myself.
[23:24:51] <duuude> wuldor: Tinnitus is real and is a real pain, you are gonna use that ear as long as you live and you may not become Allan Holdsworth to compensate for it.
[23:25:11] <apotheon> I think I'll play some simple basslines for a few minutes -- like Ministry's "So What?" . . .
[23:25:32] <mrig> wuldor do you have any clues about using sequencers on any computer system?
[23:25:46] <wuldor> mrig: Do it, have you tried the Steve Vai 30 hour workout?
[23:25:50] <wuldor> Gets your stamina up quick
[23:25:53] <mrig> or digital work station, DAW's?
[23:26:00] <apotheon> duuude: wuldor is not necessarily practicing in a way that'll cause hearing loss or tinnitus.
[23:26:10] <mrig> wuldor I'm on a programming mission at the moment :D
[23:26:16] <pyzozord> mrig: if they are drunk this will only encourage them, drunk people do not feel embarassed
[23:26:24] <apotheon> ta
[23:26:28] <mrig> and singing is more my thing musically at the mo.
[23:26:51] <wuldor> mrig: I have written my own sequencer that controls waves but no, not any system stuff.
[23:26:55] <duuude> apotheon: noise is what causes that. even normal city noise causes hear-loss. more noise, more loss.
[23:26:58] <wuldor> mrig: I'm singing whilst playing

[23:27:23] <mrig> pyzozord and the other neighbours who are not socialites or revelers, I must think of the too!
[23:28:03] <mrig> wuldor cool, yes I've taken more to using acoustic with singing rather than the electric, I used to play it a lot more.

[23:28:39] <wuldor> mrig: I'm singing with the guitar before I play a note and then improvise or do scale sequences.
[23:28:53] <mrig> awesome :)
[23:29:05] <wuldor> It is really helping me to play anything I hear in my head all of the neck, I would recommend practicing that, it's a game changer honestly.

[23:37:03] <pyzozord> oh well, the year was pretty shitty to begin with
[23:39:37] <Twix> is it already 2022 for you?

[23:41:11] <user51> you're doing better than eternal september :)
[23:41:48] <Twix> we also had bubble gum november
[23:43:30] <flakland> i don't trust gum, you keep chewing it, and chewing it, and nothing happens it just loses it's flavor. WHO CAME UP WITH THIS?
[23:43:48] <user51> do you trust food?
[23:43:53] <flakland> sometimes
[23:44:03] <user51> it just doesn't end up pretty after a few bites..
[23:44:16] <user51> but since this is ##programming i think we'd call that preprocessing
