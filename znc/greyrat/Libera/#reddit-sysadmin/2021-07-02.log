[00:00:06] <signalblue> stupid question but I have to provide remote access from my company for this app... RDGateway or Guacamole?
[00:00:14] <signofzeta> Yes, allow all.  You should put your home network IP's into UFW as well, in case you ever discontinue Cloudflare.
[00:00:45] <signalblue> Leaning towards RDGateway for some odd reason
[00:00:46] <int0x1C8> ok is there some easy or standard way to put update detection and installation in an application?
[00:01:04] <int0x1C8> like notepad++, VS, VS code, VLC, postman, etc
[00:01:30] <signalblue> trying to automate updates?
[00:01:34] <UDK450> Hmm. So if I allow access from Cloudflare's IPs, I can then go into Cloudflare's Firewall settings and restrict to just my network IP?
[00:01:43] <int0x1C8> an installed desktop application yes
[00:02:00] <signofzeta> UDK450: I'm not sure.  I've never used Cloudflare.  But if I had to guess:  yes.
[00:02:57] <UDK450> Gotcha. Looking thru it now. Thanks.
[00:03:52] <UDK450> Also, what's an excellent nginx server block resource? I spent 4+ hours trying to get things configured. I know Cloudflare didn't help matters with that though.
[00:04:23] <signofzeta> Block resource?

[00:20:31] <int0x1C8> yeah, I can't order that with my chips from chipotle
[00:20:31] <CptLuxx> you only want a web rdp client?
[00:20:37] <CptLuxx> rd gateway does a bit more..
[00:20:51] <signalblue> how does rdg do more?
[00:20:58] <CptLuxx> ??
[00:21:04] <CptLuxx> it proxys rdp connections over https
[00:21:07] <int0x1C8> not that I even like quac anyway, love queso blanco
[00:21:08] <CptLuxx> does load balancing..
[00:21:11] <signalblue> right
[00:21:15] <signalblue> so does guac
[00:21:19] <CptLuxx> nope
[00:21:22] <CptLuxx> its just a web rdp client
[00:21:47] <int0x1C8> jesus mashed avocados can load balance? o_o
[00:21:53] <int0x1C8> maybe it IS a miracle superfood
[00:22:18] <signalblue> CptLuxx: point guac to a ts broker
[00:22:29] <signalblue> and besides
[00:22:35] <CptLuxx> still a web rdp client
[00:22:35] <signalblue> I don't need any of that to start with
[00:22:52] <CptLuxx> and if i have a rd broker already why not go the full way and add a rd gateway
[00:22:53] <signalblue> you got anything against web rdp clients?
[00:23:00] <CptLuxx> no but i like my full client 
[00:23:07] <signalblue> listen
[00:23:20] <signalblue> this is for someone who knows practically nothing about tech
[00:23:28] <int0x1C8> fine, screw you all I'll take my puns elsewhere
[00:23:31] <signalblue> aka end users
[00:23:37] <CptLuxx> then go the full right way and add a normal rd gateway and the html5 webclient

[05:19:26] <BWMerlin> If I want a bunch of suppliers to give me pricing on some computers and monitors is this a request for quote or request for proposal.
[05:19:35] <xe0n> quote
[05:19:57] <BWMerlin> I thought it would be a quote but as I don't know exact make model only general specs I thought maybe proposal.
[05:20:14] <xe0n> sure so that's up to the sales\pre-sales\account managers to find a machine that fits the spec you've asked for
[05:20:38] <xe0n> they'll ask teh standard questions - whats the machine going to be used for, who will be using it, whats the life expectancy etc

[05:22:32] <xe0n> or something i dunno
[05:22:49] <xe0n> but go to shop at the big three - hp\dell\lenovo, and i'm sure you'll get half a dozen or so machines to pick from
[05:22:55] <xe0n> then its up to math and budget etc
[05:23:46] <xe0n> but also look at tools they provide to manage the fleet, dell\hp offer plenty of oob management stuff, lenovo probably does too
[05:23:50] <Jay-Ros> make sure to ask for warranties based on business hardware usage too
[05:24:03] <xe0n> yep all that fun stuff
[05:24:20] <Jay-Ros> if you can squeeze a fourth or fifth year on hw warranties, you're in the ballpark of "device is still covered", especially if you spec high
[05:24:23] <sideup66> hmmm so noone has tried this yet?
[05:24:40] <sideup66> im worried about congestion, does it lose alot of bandwidth, how are speeds, etc

[05:55:40] <Jay-Ros> "I just need to get to the supermarket on the weekend" "Yeah you're gonna need a V8 big block for that"
[05:55:45] <misspwn> well they should offer a stripped down version of it
[05:55:54] <enix> Our devs at <radio> were super anal about performance and our shit ran on everything and anything. You could run it on a potato.

[05:56:38] <Jay-Ros> bring back comic chat
[05:56:44] <enix> At present, POS Vendor wants me to give all these resources to a server because it's not handling it's own resources correctly
[05:57:19] <misspwn> cause SQL?
[05:57:44] <enix> misspwn: me?
[05:58:04] <misspwn> sure
[05:58:04] <enix> Yes, SQL is a beast, but new POS Vendor is doing it with 1/10th the resources, and more
[05:58:39] <enix> s/more/doing more
[05:58:40] <layer8> enix meant: "Yes, SQL is a beast, but new POS Vendor is doing it with 1/10th the resources, and doing more"
[05:58:59] <Jay-Ros> ohhhhh point of sale....
[05:59:10] <enix> I mean
[05:59:14] <enix> Right now, it's highly interchangable
[05:59:31] <misspwn> when they start spewing out this virtual memory thing and doing other tweaks because their software sucks, it's time to move on
[05:59:36] <xe0n> its probably because sql isn't configured correctly lol
[05:59:45] <misspwn> it's like when big companies try to use sage or quickbooks
[05:59:49] <enix> It's not our job to manage the software
[05:59:56] <enix> That's what you pay the vendor for
[05:59:58] <Jay-Ros> quickbooks - been there
[06:00:05] <misspwn> oh it is over 60% because of sql
[06:00:05] <enix> lol quickbooks

[06:01:28] <enix> Turns out they're meant to be short-term point in time backups and we're meant to handle backups VERY differently
[06:01:31] <Jay-Ros> off to tape!
[06:01:38] <Jay-Ros> buhbye
[06:01:38] <misspwn> lolol
[06:02:01] <misspwn> it's fine short term until you don't increase that budget even in the slightest
[06:02:04] <Jay-Ros> New checkpoint, hold for 30 days onsite, rest goes off tot he farm
[06:02:10] <enix> Yep, old archives getting shipped off, I'm rebuilding that server from scratch and using the official support to help me do it
[06:02:31] <Jay-Ros> noice
[06:02:57] <xe0n> Electron uses Chromium for rendering and Chromium’s behaviour is to detect how much system memory is available and utilizes enough of that memory to optimize the rendering experience. If other apps or services signal that they require system memory, Chromium gives up memory to those processes. This matters a lot less on high-end PC’s with lots of RAM, but as you get to less 
[06:02:58] <xe0n> performance machines with less RAM, for example often the choice in education to hit an aggressive price point, performance can really suffer.
[06:03:46] <xe0n> i seeee
[06:03:47] <xe0n> lol
[06:03:50] <enix> yeah i dont think anyone is going to defend Electron
[06:03:57] <xe0n> lol

[06:04:27] <enix> You know you're rendering your app inside a headless browser, and that it's going to add like 300MB to your release, but you just accept it

[06:05:27] <enix> Is Webview Microsofts alternative to Electron? Like electron for .net

[06:19:06] <Jay-Ros> fuck that, check out the seb range
[06:19:16] <Jay-Ros> similar to the amart silverwood range
[06:19:16] <enix> and they're like "Yes, we used less materials, but we're charging the same because thats how much tv units cost"
[06:19:18] <Jay-Ros> but nicer

[07:23:30] <BWMerlin> As much as I don't like Mac the truth is our business can use either
[07:23:33] <xe0n> you want macos, you buy from apple lol
[07:23:33] <csws> you should just ask for a USB-C dock as I think that's the only thing that'll interoperate with mac and windows
[07:24:00] <xe0n> anyways hp\dell\lenovo will be able to fill all those requirements, its basic stuff you're listing
[07:24:07] <BWMerlin> I *think* it needs to be displaylink to get true universal 
[07:24:08] <xe0n> differnt classes of business machines - desktops and workstations
[07:24:23] <xe0n> basic stuff
[07:24:26] <xe0n> start calling the vendors lol
[07:24:31] <csws> lmao
[07:24:34] <csws> your college has an esports taem?
[07:24:35] <csws> *team
[07:24:39] <BWMerlin> Yes
[07:24:53] *** Quits: Roughy (~mdaw45ns@user/roughy) (Quit: Meadow Fresh milk)
[07:25:05] <csws> back in my day we just made do running halo CE on the school computers!
[07:25:25] <BWMerlin> Well now it is a subject and you get graded on it
[07:25:51] <Jay-Ros> back in my day our mac pcs had one mouse button
[07:25:54] <csws> madness
[07:26:04] <csws> you probably don't need 32GB on those machines
[07:26:09] <csws> you should be more explicit about your GPU choice
[07:26:17] <CableNinja> "your K/D ratio is terrible, you get a D-"
[07:26:18] <csws> e.g. RTX 3070, Radeon 6800 XT
[07:26:19] <xe0n> anyway... just call the vendor and provide your list
[07:26:24] <csws> and you should look at high refresh rate monitors
[07:26:27] <xe0n> they'll do the work for you and provide you with choices
[07:26:31] <csws> also why do you specify a 16:10 preference on literally everything?
[07:26:52] <csws> oh wow.. got to the esports games
[07:26:57] <xe0n> 16:10 is slowly dying lol
[07:27:03] <xe0n> :(
[07:27:05] <csws> you could probably run all of those games on a second hand 1080 lol
[07:28:05] <Jay-Ros> prodesk g6 600 SFF with gt 1050 :P
[07:28:17] <BWMerlin> I asked about high refresh rate and colour accurate and they said they didn't need them
[07:28:30] <BWMerlin> So 60Hz it is
[07:29:13] <xe0n> anyway what you're asking for is pretty standard stuff, hp\dell will have offerings for most of that
[07:29:24] <BWMerlin> The main purpose of them is the design side of things, the eSports is secondary (part of that is they know they won't get eSports desktops so better to aim for graphics/design and then use them for eSports afterwards)
[07:31:18] <xe0n> man i just made 2min noodles
[07:31:21] <xe0n> and they're so flavourless
[07:31:21] <xe0n> LOL
[07:31:25] <Jay-Ros> did....
[07:31:26] <xe0n> taste like rubbish
[07:31:30] <Jay-Ros> did you add the flavour?
[07:31:33] <xe0n> i did
[07:31:37] <xe0n> i think i added too much water
[07:31:38] <xe0n> LOL
[07:31:41] <Jay-Ros> ah
[07:31:46] <Jay-Ros> mi goreng?
[07:31:55] <xe0n> nah some chicken flavoured crap
[07:31:58] <BWMerlin> IMO 16:10 is more business because of the extra vertical, I am willing to compromise/work with whoever on requirements
[07:31:58] <xe0n> i aint a fan
[07:32:09] <xe0n> im all for 16:10...i use them
[07:32:19] <xe0n> but they're harder to find these days
[07:32:25] <xe0n> and they dont tend to come in 27inch
[07:32:27] <xe0n> usually < 24
[07:32:39] <xe0n> from what i can see, dell only have one model which is 16:10 now, which...i wouldn't mind :P
[07:32:48] <BWMerlin> I have this old Kogan which is 2560 x 1600
[07:33:06] <xe0n> okay? keyword old
[07:33:13] <BWMerlin> Dell has 1200 and 1600
[07:33:15] <xe0n> i have these old dell ultrasharps :P
[07:33:27] <Jay-Ros> I've got samsung sr350s
[07:33:43] <BWMerlin> LG has some new ultragear which is also 16:10
[07:33:51] <xe0n> LG..consumer
[07:34:10] <xe0n> if you want to save and get your moneys worht, you're going to buy the monitor with the pc
[07:34:15] <xe0n> else your special pricing can go sidewards lol
[07:34:32] <xe0n> dude i suggest you call and speak to some vendors\vars, you'll get an understanding of what the current offerings are
[07:34:44] <Jay-Ros> 100%
[07:35:07] <BWMerlin> I am just going to email them all now, I am not spending all day on the phone if I can help it
[07:35:22] <BWMerlin> Give them the written requirements and let them get back to me.
[07:35:23] <Jay-Ros> you'll get a bunch of lunch invites too no doubt
[07:35:25] <xe0n> who says all day? they dont want to spend all day on the phone either
[07:35:38] <xe0n> yeah get the lunch invite to the tech center
[07:35:40] <xe0n> to suss out all the machines lol
[07:36:10] <xe0n> blahh
[07:36:13] <xe0n> those noodles were shit!
[07:36:23] <Jay-Ros> add soy?
[07:36:25] <BWMerlin> Then I will be just like the BM at my last job, getting wined and dinned and making poor choices
[07:36:48] <Jay-Ros> nah you maintain a strong arm
[07:36:59] <Jay-Ros> and get wined and dined
[07:38:12] <csws> BWMerlin, you got a budget for this too? do you know if the college has preferred vendors already?
[07:38:19] <csws> or perhaps from whoever funds your college too?
[07:38:42] <BWMerlin> lol budget
[07:39:03] <BWMerlin> No budget but I have been asked to look into it and I will put it in my budget for next year
[07:39:30] <xe0n> loll
[07:39:52] <csws> lol wtf
[07:40:22] <csws> can't you just make up some numbers then
[07:40:28] <Jay-Ros> incoming refurbed prodesk 400 g1 sffs but the truckload
[07:40:32] <csws> e.g. $2k per normie machine, $4k for media lab PCs

[08:03:12] <layer8> sd meant: "02<s​ysadmin> Even an A400? That's bottom of the barrel garbage"
[08:03:36] <BWMerlin> I think some of the speed will depend on the CPU in the POS and can it feed the SSD fast enough
[08:03:40] <Jay-Ros> have you considered boot from SAN?
[08:03:44] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Yes A is a vowel
[08:03:55] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> i3 3220
[08:04:12] <Jay-Ros> then you could centralise the 4 POS machines and have redundancy on drive failure across the board
[08:04:27] <BWMerlin> For sales I would recommend going fast as no one wants to wait on a slow PC but you might have a weak system overall so while an SSD will help it may not be able to take full advantage of the SSD speed.

[08:07:35] <xe0n> have a sign on the door directing them to 7-Eleven for cheaper coffee
[08:07:42] <Jay-Ros> you can use the second girl as a physical load balancer

[08:31:26] <JollyRgrs> but i'm kinda getting fed up with ubnt making my old UAP (B/G/N) be EoL and no more configurable from the controller
[08:31:30] <Jay-Ros> I've got a shitty TP link home wifi dude at home, it's got three sticks so it's good for wifi, and nice and central
[08:31:52] <Jay-Ros> but I'm in an apartment with three directional legs so it works for me, I only really play with unifi, meraki and the other one
[08:31:58] <JollyRgrs> it just runs the 2.4ghz SSID for my IoT, not even my main 5ghz network... but I need the old AP for better range in that area
[08:32:15] <xe0n> buy a new unifi ap?
[08:32:17] <xe0n> one that has support?
[08:32:23] <xe0n> means you just swap the AP you're good to go
[08:32:25] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: that's one thought
[08:32:29] <xe0n> can use the same controller etc/
[08:32:38] <xe0n> PLUG N PLAY
[08:32:41] <JollyRgrs> but i seem to be having some other issues and can't pinpoint if they are ubnt's fault or not
[08:32:41] <xe0n> neeeexxxttt
[08:32:45] <xe0n> ahhh
[08:32:56] <JollyRgrs> might also be airport radar... even though i've switched off of DFS channels and still having drops
[08:33:19] <JollyRgrs> chromecast was dropping wifi mult. times during a movie... two different devices
[08:33:36] *** Quits: rhymeswithmogul (~signofzet@user/signofzeta) (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:33:38] <JollyRgrs> and it won't reconnect well. it just keeps cycling of connecting, reconnecting, etc. until you power cycle either the device or the AP
[08:34:09] *** Joins: rhymeswithmogul (~signofzet@user/signofzeta)
[08:34:11] <JollyRgrs> so... i'm at the point where either A) I continue to purchase UAP devices or B) I cut my losses and move to another brand
[08:34:13] <xe0n> sucking up to many wifis
[08:34:19] <JollyRgrs> I don't want to do A, and then ALSO B
[08:34:42] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: yeah, i went full xzibit
[08:34:55] <JollyRgrs> i got wifis for my wifi to suck up to my wifi
[08:36:01] <Jay-Ros> JollyRgrs, is it a speed thing for the IoT stuff?
[08:36:17] <Jay-Ros> Mi has those little usb wifi repeaters you could chuck near your things :p they're like 10 bucks each
[08:36:18] <xe0n> +++
[08:37:09] <Jay-Ros> they pick up one network and pump out a low-power one with a different name nearby; they run on usb 5v
[08:37:24] <JollyRgrs> Jay-Ros: speed thing?
[08:37:47] <JollyRgrs> it's just range... they can see the signal a lot better than they can spit their Tx out back to the AP
[08:38:03] <JollyRgrs> so a Long range AP won't help any... it's the IoT device that has to shout louder... or have an AP closer
[08:38:25] <Jay-Ros> ah makes sense. Sounds like you need to get your wiffies closer :(
[08:38:30] <JollyRgrs> i'd rather not make it more complex by adding so many repeaters like that
[08:38:42] <xe0n> you run multiple aps? get a three pack of unifis and mount them around the house
[08:38:51] <JollyRgrs> well, it's fine for now... cept that the one AP is EoL and once I upgrade my controller, I won't be able to manage it anymore
[08:38:55] <JollyRgrs> i got 3
[08:38:58] <xe0n> nice
[08:39:03] <JollyRgrs> two UAP-AC Lites and an old UAP
[08:39:03] <Jay-Ros> do you have the AP-PRO or AP-Lite ones?
[08:39:11] <Jay-Ros> yeah, have a look at the meshy bois
[08:39:14] <JollyRgrs> my og UAP is not lite and not pro
[08:39:14] <Jay-Ros> the unifi ones
[08:39:19] <JollyRgrs> i was wondering about that
[08:39:29] <JollyRgrs> i never have messed with mesh yet... but interested in it
[08:39:30] <Jay-Ros> I've got them running on a site - they do a good job
[08:39:40] <Jay-Ros> you just power them up and they do their thing, they're pretty good
[08:39:55] <Jay-Ros> on unifi you adopt them like normal
[08:39:55] <JollyRgrs> still manage them with the controller just like other APs?
[08:40:02] <Jay-Ros> yeah
[08:40:25] <xe0n> yeah i got the ac something or other, works fine?
[08:40:30] <xe0n> can't say i worry about wifi at home...ever lol
[08:40:54] <JollyRgrs> what am I looking at in terms of coverage/range of mesh vs standard units?
[08:41:03] <JollyRgrs> do i need more mesh than i do normal APs? or about the same?
[08:41:06] <a1> i don't have home wifi probs either. but my setup is semple
[08:41:10] <a1> s/sem/sim
[08:41:10] <layer8> a1 meant: "i don't have home wifi probs either. but my setup is simple"
[08:42:07] <Jay-Ros> it's been a minute, but the site has the info
[08:42:27] <Jay-Ros> I've only used them on a (insert PM) but line of site they're pretty far range

[08:45:14] <xe0n> 6eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[08:46:46] <Jay-Ros> Umm... check the speed difference on 5 v 6, see if it's necessary for a chromecast :P
[08:47:05] <Jay-Ros> Unless you're gearing up for 8k I'd say "the extra money spent for bleeding edge isn't worth it"
[08:49:32] <JollyRgrs> so is there ANY benefit at all for me doing mesh if i already have ethernet ran to my AP locations already?
[08:49:45] <xe0n> “That is something that is already there now. By the end of the month, it will be at another level which would see it being able to be incorporated in things like Apple Wallets and the like. We will put in place a digital vaccination authentication at border.”
[08:49:46] <JollyRgrs> just seems non-intuitive to do mesh if they are all plugged into ethernet. what other benefits would i get?

[11:21:28] <xe0n> he said he wanted a small gift, but not a mini one
[11:21:31] <JollyRgrs> he's even got the 5g upgrade
[11:21:34] <JollyRgrs> LOL!
[11:21:49] <xe0n> :P
[11:22:29] <xe0n> anyways todays beer choice is hahn premium light
[11:22:35] <xe0n> it was on special for $47
[11:22:38] <JollyRgrs> geez, i got scripts for 11 different services to update my certs when i renew with LE
[11:22:39] <xe0n> that aint bad
[11:22:50] <xe0n> LOL
[11:22:54] <JollyRgrs> $47? geez, my flippy floppies cost as much as a beer?
[11:22:59] <xe0n> yep!
[11:23:02] <xe0n> aus is a rip offfff
[11:23:09] <JollyRgrs> yup
[11:23:31] <JollyRgrs> so yeah... 11 diff. deployment scripts, but some like "deploy_apache.sh" are used on more than one server (i think? or at some points are?)
[11:23:56] <JollyRgrs> and my new one for my dafang flashed wyze cams (3 of them) is used... well, 3 times
[11:25:11] <JollyRgrs> 16 servers right now in my list to get updated
[11:25:14] <JollyRgrs> why do i do this to myself?
[11:25:18] <xe0n> all with the same cert?
[11:25:19] <xe0n> lol
[11:25:26] <xe0n> WILDCARD LIFE BABY!
[11:25:33] <JollyRgrs> it IS the same cert
[11:25:50] <JollyRgrs> works for *.domain.tld, domain.tld, and *.sub.domain.tld
[11:25:59] <Jay-Ros> JollyRgrs, I don't do gag gifts
[11:26:32] <JollyRgrs> so opnsense runs the ACME bot and then spins off a script to scp the certs to each box and then run the deploy.sh with an ssh command
[11:26:48] <Jay-Ros> hahn premium light xe0n?
[11:26:51] <JollyRgrs> Jay-Ros: oh dang, what about if enix is also bound?
[11:26:51] <Jay-Ros> light beer??
[11:26:57] <JollyRgrs> doe she not do bound AND gagged?
[11:27:00] <Jay-Ros> that'd be MY gift
[11:27:03] <Jay-Ros> o.O
[11:27:05] <JollyRgrs> lol
[11:27:08] <xe0n> i mix between heavies and light

[11:27:41] <xe0n> wooop
[11:27:51] <Jay-Ros> can I get a 120 second countdown?
[11:28:03] <JollyRgrs> in a minute
[11:28:10] <xe0n> so is this printer stuff applicable on desktop?
[11:28:19] <xe0n> because the desktop team just told me they've disabled the spooler on deskstops
[11:28:24] <JollyRgrs> ...
[11:28:27] <xe0n> im like errrr is that even in scope?!
[11:28:41] <xe0n> nothing about desktops from what i've seen the past two days lol
[11:28:42] <xe0n> soooo
[11:29:02] <JollyRgrs> i thought the PoC allowed to run as system, but it looks like they have to be serving the printer
[11:29:12] <xe0n> csws plz confirm
[11:29:19] <JollyRgrs> so... as long as they aren't sharing it to others, i'm not sure it can be exploited, but IANAsecurityguy
[11:29:37] <csws> xe0n, idk I heard some whispers about desktops and datacom reckons so
[11:29:47] <csws> in theory I'd say yes it could be vulnerable
[11:30:07] <xe0n> well the thing i laughed about to my manager was i gave the heads up in the morn and was told "yeah nah all good we aint gonna do anything"
[11:30:11] <xe0n> nek minit there's a fucking war room and such
[11:30:12] <csws> some people were coping by saying "muh firewall" but I don't think that matters if yo'ure on the domain profile

If I'm understanding it correctly, the shared storage is to store data locally as it processes/replicates.

[18:01:42] <JollyRgrs> ok?

[18:02:06] <sd> 09<H​aise> https://retropie.org.uk/ ?
[18:02:14] <JollyRgrs> well, if you are using a pi, then yes, it (as default) only has HDMI out and you'll have to convert somehow

[18:02:29] <sd> 13<C​olour> And use a basic bitch PC
[18:02:36] <JollyRgrs> and yes, there was a small window where there were even widescreen CRT... they might be 720p with HDMI input tbh
[18:02:52] <shibboleth> the pi has s-vhs/composite out
[18:03:10] <JollyRgrs> uh... DVI is still digital, so are you talking about using DVI with the analog pins? could just get VGA at that point

[18:03:25] <sd> 13<C​olour> DVII is Analog and Digital, DVID is just Digital, DVIA is just Analog
[18:03:25] <JollyRgrs> for CRT, you'd probably be better using component out
[18:03:39] <JollyRgrs> yeah, but i mean... that's just making it VGA at that point
[18:03:40] <shibboleth> composite
[18:03:41] <sd> 13<C​olour> 980 has DVII but 1070ti has DVID so no go for that one
[18:03:58] <JollyRgrs> shibboleth: component can do 720p and better coloring
[18:04:09] <sd> 13<C​olour> I think you can adapt VGA to composite or component and still get the no-lag aspect
[18:04:15] <shibboleth> yeah, but the pi doesn't do component :)
[18:04:18] <JollyRgrs> composite is the single yellow cable w/o clock
[18:04:26] <JollyRgrs> older ATI cards would be best, IMO
[18:04:46] <JollyRgrs> ATI has always lagged being nvidia in FPS, but in terms of PQ and analog out, ATI won every time in my book

[20:56:09] <gibby> quality is by far the worst
[20:56:10] <JollyRgrs> Teamspeak from back when i used it way back when still was superior audio quality to today's discord
[20:56:27] <JollyRgrs> and i've not used it in prob close to 10 years
