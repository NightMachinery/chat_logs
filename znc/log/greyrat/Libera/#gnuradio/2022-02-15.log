[12:02:58] <l4rrybr3nt[m]> No matter what I do in the chain, I never hear anything. The WBFM demod works fine though. I even did a AM TX chain with modulator from a .wav source and hooked the AM demod at the end of the chain which works fine. Just not with a real RF signal. So I must have done something wrong inbetween, just cant find it

[12:07:56] <LordKalma> l4rrybr3nt[m], why are you resampling after the AM demod?
[12:08:43] <LordKalma> ah nevermind, you're doing the demod at 200k
[12:11:21] <l4rrybr3nt[m]> yes exactly. did that first on a more AF level but tried a few AM examples from google.. ok, I just switched from the hackrf board to an rtl-sdr. I now hear something noise as expected. Maybe the level coming from the hackrf seems way too low

[12:15:31] <muaddib[m]> You should go through the tutorials we’ve made.... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/80d1077b96f15c0eaeabe707169b075a6791559f)
[12:17:06] <LordKalma> libera has an official matrix bridge?
[12:17:26] <LordKalma> muaddib[m], that QPSK tutorial has been useful to me :p
[12:20:16] <muaddib[m]> I think most of them are useful. GNURadio is very powerful. I’ve seen a lot of folks chase their tail (I’ve been one of them) trying to implement something that already has a block or a tutorial written, so I’m a big fan of going to the docs. I haven’t contributed near as much as some folks, but the things I’ve added were gaps that I experienced.
[12:20:46] <LordKalma> sometimes reinventing the wheel is a good academic example
[12:20:51] <LordKalma> that said, depends on your level
[12:21:38] <muaddib[m]> l4rrybr3nt: many are happy to help you here. Glad you’re giving GNURadio a shot. Sounds like you’ve narrowed it down to your hardware. I don’t have a hackrf but I’m sure many others can help.
[12:21:48] <LordKalma> people that have literal zero knowledge and want to get something going to get that dopamine rush of achieving something but don't read the docs are in for some frustration
[12:22:15] <LordKalma> well, you can always crank up the gain on the HackRF
[12:22:22] <LordKalma> don't forget the HackRF is deaf as a door
[12:23:17] <LordKalma> I have one, they are hilariously bad 
[12:23:52] <LordKalma> but hey, it's cheap stuff, and it's a great toy otherwise
[12:23:58] <muaddib[m]> Idk. Lot of folks have done a bunch of good work with them. Depends on the application.
[12:24:09] <LordKalma> you can do many things with them
[12:24:47] <LordKalma> I have the port-a-pack shield on mine, and it awes me how you can even have a small waterfall on that CPU/SoC/whatever-that-weird-thing-is
[12:25:13] <LordKalma> doesn't mean it's the sensitivity king :) strong points and weak points 
[12:27:14] <LordKalma> the HackRF is the worst receiver I have, but it's my only 6GHz receiver
[12:27:15] <LordKalma> so there's that
[12:28:44] <l4rrybr3nt[m]> LordKalma: 1st I really don't avoid reading the docs BUT I just seem to have missed the right part. There are many lessons out, many also on the HackRF with GRC but mine did act different - so its sure my fault
[12:29:47] <LordKalma> oh, I'm sorry, I didn't intend in any way to associate you with my comments
[12:29:52] <l4rrybr3nt[m]> Have a bunch of SDRs here and I agree with you. Its really not sensitive but the only 6GHz capable thing I own :)

[15:53:18] <l4rrybr3nt[m]> The osmocom source still behaves strange: With the RTL stick attached I can well receive AM. With the HackRF not. Like not enough gain (Both SDR attached to the same Antenna) -> if I crank up the RF/BB/IF gains, it doesnt seem to have any effect on the received signal. I thought I might have fried the input circuit but in GQRX I have full control of the gains and also the RX amp works.. I go on developing with the RTL for now but I
[15:53:18] <l4rrybr3nt[m]> have to clear things up. Is there anything I could have messed up in the osmocom source?

[22:32:47] <muaddib[m]> Paging Dr. MPEG
[22:33:14] <muaddib[m]> I think he probably has a FLEX or POCSAG pager :)
[22:36:41] <mhilts[m]> I have made a little but of progress, I see that the "Random Uniform Source" block produces pseudorandom bytes! I am thinking that there will be a way to add a MPEG-2 Transport Stream header for every 187 bytes. Dr. MPEG sounds like the perfect person for this haha. 
[22:36:56] <mhilts[m]> s/but/bit/
[22:42:54] <BarryDuggan[m]> muaddib: the best way to get his attention is to press the '@' key followed by 'drmpeg' like this drmpeg 
[22:45:14] <BarryDuggan[m]> also, if a person has been on the screen recently, you can click their name
[22:47:29] <muaddib[m]> Yea, I know. Mobile doesn’t support that though
[22:47:30] <muaddib[m]> Barry Duggan:
[22:47:53] <muaddib[m]> Does that show on your screen as a tag or just your name with a ‘:’ after it?
[23:00:17] <mhilts[m]> It looks like it is just a ':' to me
[23:04:14] <Zero_Chaos> Is there any need for uhd-3.15 in gentoo if I also ship uhd 4.1?  I'm hitting some bugs in 3.15 and it seems a lot easier to drop it than fix it.
[23:09:49] <Zero_Chaos> mbr0wn[m]: ^^
[23:12:41] <BarryDuggan[m]> muaddib: and mhilts with Element in a browser, there are more capabilities.

[23:17:01] <willcode4[m]> Zero_Chaos: GR is fine with UHD-4.1, and it's transparent to the user. Maybe additional RFNoC features. There may be other users of UHD.
[23:18:00] <Zero_Chaos> willcode4[m]: are you aware of any difference between 3.15 and 4.1 that might have a meaningful difference to some consumer?  I'm shipping gr 3.8 and getting ready to bump to 3.9 (I know I'm behind).
[23:18:19] <muaddib[m]> <BarryDuggan[m]> "muaddib: and mhilts with Element..." <- Yea I’m aware. On occasion I wait to post things until I can get to a browser.
[23:19:00] <muaddib[m]> That’s also why sometimes I hit the reply button instead of just tagging names. It’s the only way to focus a message on the mobile app.
[23:21:02] <willcode4[m]> On 3.8 vs 3.9, we're recommending 3.10 if possible. Most OOTs that work with 3.9 seem to be good with 3.10. Only other external UHD users I know of are the other frameworks - Soapy and OsmoSDR. I don't know the API changes that well, so better wait for mbr0wn for an opinon on that.
[23:22:21] <Zero_Chaos> willcode4[m]: I'm shipping a new enough soapy and osmosdr that it won't be a problem.  Thanks.  And yes, I plan to stop up to 3.10 asap, but I planned on stepping "through 3.9" unless you think that's a waste.  I've heard somethings don't work with 3.10 yet but that could already be fixed.
[23:27:19] <willcode4[m]> I'm sure there are some things that don't work with 3.10 yet, not sure what, or what you package. GQRX works with 3.10, as do gr-satellites, gr-fosphor, gr-ieee-80211. OOTs you need would be the only reason to use 3.9.
[23:33:20] <willcode4[m]> Also, gr-ieee-802154, gr-rds, inspectrum. I see those under net-wireless.
[23:34:08] <Zero_Chaos> willcode4[m]: primarily I'm not sure if trunk-radio works with gr 3.10, but if that's my only concern I think I will jump right to 3.10
[23:34:15] <Zero_Chaos> willcode4[m]: thanks!
[23:36:43] <muaddib[m]> willcode4: just for grins I tried using the generic soapy block with UHD. My GNURadio is built against UHD 4.1, but it appears that the soapy block is expecting 3.15LTS. is that because the 3.9 repo includes UHD 3.15?
[23:37:32] <willcode4[m]> Did you rebuild the soapyuhd after changing to 4.1?
[23:38:16] <willcode4[m]> GR doesn't even know what version of UHD a Soapy driver is built against, so likely a link problem.
[23:38:29] <willcode4[m]> UHD is not included in the GR repo anyway, just gr-uhd which can deal with either version.
[23:47:07] <willcode4[m]> Zero_Chaos: Verified GR -> Soapy -> soapyuhd -> UHD-4.1 builds/works.
