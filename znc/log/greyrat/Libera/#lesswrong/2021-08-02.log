[00:16:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm. I had no idea https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Airport was so important and significant
[00:16:02] <Robomot> Shannon Airport - Wikipedia (Shannon Airport (Irish: Aerfort na Sionainne)[4][5] (IATA: SNN, ICAO: EINN) is an international airport located in County Clare in the Republic of Ireland. It is adjacent to the Shannon Estuary and lies halfway between Ennis and Limerick. The airport is the third busiest airport in the Republic of Ireland, and the fifth busiest on the island. …)
[00:17:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> We had a stopover at Shannon when we came to the U.S., my family and I
[00:17:16] <gwern> 'fifth busiest in ireland' is rather damning with faint praise
[00:17:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> That airport is where I had a sandwich for the first time!
[00:17:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Yes, well, read on
[00:17:47] <gwern> hold on, surely russia had 'meat between bread' before you came to the civilized first world
[00:18:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nope.
[00:18:53] <gwern> so we finally found a way the west is superior to russia culinarily!
[00:18:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was strictly "meat [or other things] atop bread"
[00:20:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> In fact one of the most popular Soviet children's cartoons starts out with a scene in which one of the characters, a talking cat, didactically informs the protagonist that he is eating his meat-on-bread incorrectly: the meat should be facing down, the better to directly contact one's tongue
[00:21:17] <gwern> wait, so it's supposed to be bread-on-meat, not meat-on-bread?
[00:21:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's the claim
[00:21:56] <gwern> was the talking cat right? they tend to be
[00:22:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> There is reason to be skeptical, let us say
[00:23:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://picturehistory.livejournal.com/5427874.html discussion of said idea's provenance - apparently it's rather older than the cartoon

[00:24:42] <gwern> so the meat is like, a salami or deli sliced meat?
[00:24:52] <gwern> huh, it really is just on top of the bread
[00:25:06] <gwern> this is the laziest sandwich I've seen since toast sandwiches
[00:25:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> The meat in this particular instance is kolbasa (Doktorskaya, presumably)
[00:25:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is basically bologna, I guess
[00:25:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> As for "laziest", I prefer the term "efficient"
[00:26:19] * gwern is surprised to see so much praise for _the green knight_ in his twitter today and yesterday. is it possible hollywood somehow turned "sir gawain and the green knight" into... a good movie?!

[00:28:13] <gwern> well, that's confusing. was he drunk, having a heart attack, sick, or asleep? surely it was only one of them
[00:29:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> He overslept, clearly. Would Yeltsin lie? Surely not
[00:29:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was all the fault of those pesky underlings, who were, of course, duly punished

[02:11:42] <gwern> using an insecure phone would be too easy a loophole to that geas, obviously
[02:11:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> So I surmise from all of this that the dating pool in the Bay Area consists of:
[02:11:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. Men who don't want kids
[02:11:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. Women who want kids

[02:12:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> (child-having preference for the last category unspecified)

[02:20:19] <saturn2> "i will not accept having my time wasted. i expect you to impregnate me within 5 minutes."
[02:20:29] <nshepperd> that's what dating apps are

[06:38:25] <shawwwn> It must be possible to parallelize the calcs
[06:38:38] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: nice. i figured jax.jit should be able to speed it up nicely since like 80% of time in my pytorch one was cpu overhead
[06:39:32] <shawwwn> The best part is, I was able to use Jax’s mask() function, which basically lets you pretend you have dynamic tensor shapes inside the sampling loop
[06:40:42] <shawwwn> Normally you can’t have dynamic shapes in an XLA program, which is a problem for GPT because (as you know) the key/value “past” tensors have a shape that depends on the sequence length — each iteration adds another past KV
[06:41:07] <shawwwn> But I can just concatenate the kv’s to the end and not care thanks to mask()

[06:44:20] <shawwwn> Here’s how it works. You create a mask specification: https://github.com/shawwn/openai-server/blob/jax-wip/openai_server/gpt/jax/model.py#L493

[06:44:52] <shawwwn> that shit is really hard to read, but basically it’s saying that each K and V has shape _,n,_,_
[06:45:22] <shawwwn> And since we’re concatenating one more K and V each iteration, it returns _,n+1,_,_
[06:46:09] <shawwwn> Normally this doesn’t help us, because the shape still ends up changing — after all, it’s returning a shape of n + 1, not n. So that means
[06:46:14] <shawwwn> The shape grows each iteration
[06:47:46] *** Joins: nullcone (uid11626@id-11626.brockwell.irccloud.com)
[06:48:18] <shawwwn> However, I trim off the end of that n + 1 here: https://github.com/shawwn/openai-server/blob/jax-wip/openai_server/gpt/jax/model.py#L515

[06:48:36] <shawwwn> And then *that’s* the function I call within the sampling loop
[06:49:21] <shawwwn> So the shape stays the same each iteration — you pass in a padded buffer of K’s and V’s, and mask() takes care of all the details of indexing into the padded arrays properly
[06:49:21] <nshepperd2> so... 'mask' automatically rewrites every xla op to something that masks out the extra elements in the array in the appropriate way?
[06:49:30] <shawwwn> Yup, you got it.
[06:50:34] <shawwwn> For example, the mask function for jnp.concatenate is implemented as “add to the end, then copy it from the end to wherever the current N is” — it’s really cool.
[06:51:10] <shawwwn> So I can just do an einsum against the concatenated K’s and V’s, and the final result is correct, because it ignores all the masked parts
[06:51:34] <nshepperd2> jax devs are insane
[06:52:12] <shawwwn> Naw, I thought so too but the way it works is actually pretty simple. https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autodidax.html
[06:52:23] <feepbot> Autodidax: JAX core from scratch — JAX  documentation
[06:52:42] <shawwwn> That notebook walks you through the core ideas in Jax. And it’s remarkably simple
[06:53:31] <shawwwn> Basically, for any given function, you can map out what that function is doing by passing in “tracer” objects as arguments. E.g. suppose you have a function like lambda x, y: x + y
[06:54:05] <shawwwn> Normally you call it with 1 and 2 to get 3. But you can call it with your own stub objects, as long as your objects implement __add__
[06:54:35] <shawwwn> So since you know the input shape sizes, you can make stub objects that capture the program structure
[06:54:50] <shawwwn> And then you can interpret that structure however you want
[06:54:57] <nshepperd2> yeah it's the same thing https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ad does
[06:55:01] <Robomot> ad: Automatic Differentiation (Install via `cabal install ad`. …)
[06:55:30] <shawwwn> the numpy interpreter simply evaluates each argument directly. But the JIT interpreter turns the program into XLA
[06:55:58] <shawwwn> vmap() adds a batching axis
[06:56:05] <shawwwn> mask() is simply another interpreter
[06:57:17] <nshepperd2> since it unrolls loops, i suppose you could also just jax.jit the whole sampling loop, and make a really big XLA program. wonder if that would be too big
[06:57:30] <feep> dbohdan: konrad zuse operating the z3 https://imgur.com/a/YKN0KTZ it ended up a *lot* weirder than charles babbage
[06:57:33] <shawwwn> That’s why I like the “pytree” design so much — it’s why Jax works with any program structure, even for programs that return custom objects

[06:57:51] <shawwwn> As long as you can flatten and unflatten an object, all the tracing works fine
[06:58:08] <shawwwn> And pytrees are how you define how to flatten and unflatten various objects
[06:58:29] <nshepperd2> feep: love the one where he's sticking his face out of the monitor
[06:58:35] <shawwwn> lax.scan has an unroll parameter where you can specify how many iterations per step to unroll
[06:59:45] <shawwwn> But unfortunately the iteration count apparently needs to be a static parameter, meaning you can’t pass in a variable number of tokens to sample.
[07:00:00] <shawwwn> So I’m gonna try to rewrite it as a for loop
[07:00:38] <shawwwn> (But that’s also why lax.scan supports gradients, whereas for loops only support forward mode gradients — lax.scan requires a static iteration count)

[07:04:37] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: I *think* the problem is, if the loop has a variable execution count, then backwards gradient memory usage can grow with respect to that count

[08:25:11] <saturn2> isn't it way below the mean on taste?

[08:49:17] <Nivim> (On produce breeding priorities): The same kind of pattern could apply to a lot more than just apples. I had assumed changes in pesticides or fertilizers were making almost every kind of fruit and vegetable steadily worse over the years, but I guess breeding for every trait I don't care about would also do it. I care not at all about taste or appearance, and very much about how it makes my blood vessels
[08:49:19] <Nivim> and flesh feel after I eat it. It used to be that a decent bowl of fruit would leave you feeling refresh almost like you'd gotten a night of sleep, particularly if you had but said sleep hadn't been restful, and now nothing but old herbal tea seems to have anywhere near as much effect.
[08:51:55] <Nivim> I very much miss how strawberries used to be around 10 years ago, and only homegrown or wild ones seem to (inconsistently) replicate now.
[08:52:34] <gwern> I don't know if that's really breeding's fault. it certainly *can* backfire like that due to negative genetic correlations, but it's also true that many breeding programs use fairly elaborate indexes to maximize overall progress and market value rather than myopically maximizing some proxy like fat percentage
[08:53:19] <gwern> and it's also hard to argue that the market doesn't work for apples, specifically, given that I pick up a new club apple almost literally every other time I go grocery shopping

[09:08:57] <gwern> definitely among the weirder sleep hacks I've heard
[09:09:40] <rmmh> is this the ghost of jobs preaching fruitarianism?
[09:09:46] <Nivim> Someday I would like to figure out how it works, rather than just flailing into doing it.
[09:10:02] <rmmh> the real sleep hack is r/childfree
[09:10:03] <nshepperd2> Nivim eats only magical underworld pomegranates
[09:10:15] <Nivim> Citrus in general doesn't seem very effective.
[09:10:28] <rmmh> are you chronically close to scurvy?
[09:10:52] <Nivim> I don't think so? I have a lot more vC sources than just fruit.
[09:11:00] <saturn2> what kind of herbal tea has this effect?
[09:11:22] <Nivim> Oh hey, we had this conversation? Let me check my history.
[09:11:54] <saturn2> herbal tea wouldn't have any vitamin C
[09:11:57] <nshepperd2> i suppose being in a constant state of malnutrition could result in random foods seeming to have miraculous effect
[09:12:27] <gwern> nothing comes to mind but vitamin c and Nivim has specifically ruled out citruses
[09:13:02] <gwern> it's not like fruits really have much beyond sugar. they're not full of essential amino acids, or fats, or odd minerals like iodine
[09:13:31] <rmmh> are/were you underweight?
[09:13:35] <gwern> (they have loads of weird chemicals, but not much that ought to be a critical nutrient you could easily be deficient in and see any acute benefits from)
[09:13:44] <Nivim> Extremely badly underweight, basically my whole life.
[09:13:47] <rmmh> oh.
[09:13:55] <Nivim> rmmh: What are you thinking of?
[09:14:17] <rmmh> then it doesn't have to be anything more complex than fatigue from not enough food rapidly alleviated by the sugars in fruit
[09:14:29] <rmmh> or, more tritely, 'low blood sugar'
[09:14:35] <Nivim> Ah, no; I'm carful about that with other sources for blood suguar.
[09:14:58] <Nivim> I mean, adding equivalent amounts of fructose to a food doesn't have the effect.
[09:15:01] <gwern> ? you're controlling blood sugar... but you're still chomping down on big bowls of sugar?
[09:15:03] <saturn2> i don't think the amount of sugar in fruits has gone down
[09:15:03] <rmmh> there's a lot of complex processes beyond just blood sugar for perceived energy, of course
[09:15:04] <PapuaHardyNet> does being underweight mean you have more fatigue? That sounds suspect
[09:15:05] <Nivim> I have tried that before.
[09:15:24] <Nivim> gwern: Making sure I always have enough? Not diabetic.
[09:15:37] <saturn2> i think the amount of sugar in fruits has actually gone up
[09:15:38] <rmmh> PapuaHardyNet: I'm thinking the kind of low-food-drive underweight where you forget to eat for 12 hours then have an apple and feel refreshed
[09:15:40] <nshepperd2> PapuaHardyNet: you need calories to do things
[09:16:33] <Nivim> Ah, no; part of keeping a food log is making sure I never make that kind of mistake; if I go without food long enough like that, I start with a broth of some sort sort and milk to pick me up, then go for a full meal after that.
[09:16:58] <rmmh> I'm just speculating at this point, but kind of discounting the hack as "weird underweight problems"
[09:17:02] <Nivim> I don't try using fruit when I'm starving since it's probably not going to be enough to help.
[09:17:17] <Nivim> rmmh: Yeah, maybe.
[09:17:20] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder how that correlates with intermittent fasting and OMAD. I have tried OMAD, and that actually gives me more energy (unless I work out) throughout the day.
[09:17:35] <rmmh> in general obese people have problems because their organs and joints are chronically overstressed, and underweight people have problems because their body is chronically undernourished
[09:17:43] <PapuaHardyNet> keeping a food log is a good idea, but also hard. how do you make it easier?
[09:18:36] <Nivim> I guess I don't? For me it's just a lot of stubborness, turning my OCD to the purpose of good, and slowly developing good technical shorthand.
[09:18:38] <rmmh> PapuaHardyNet: I suspect IF/OMAD energy levels vary with BF% and how readily the body can harness fat stores for ketosis
[09:19:54] <Nivim> (The most annoying part is when I switch to a new brand or product often and so need to write out the entire ingredients list, producer, distributor, expiry date, country of origin, and such.)
[09:20:17] <PapuaHardyNet> rmmh: yes, that seems the most likely explanation
[09:20:52] <rmmh> fasting + low bf% seems more likely to activate our various starvation adaptations
[09:20:56] <PapuaHardyNet> Nivim: what tracking software do you use / recommend
[09:21:10] <rmmh> PapuaHardyNet: I'm partial to cronometer for food tracking
[09:21:16] <rmmh> but have only used it to lose weight
[09:21:29] <PapuaHardyNet> I'll try cronometer, thanks
[09:21:50] <rmmh> has lots of customizability for the various micronutrients / targets / whatever weird diet you want
[09:23:23] <Nivim> Papua': Ah! Sorry; I tend to want to have it right wherever I'm actually going to eat, as well as be flexible with notation, and so use a notebook. I really should move to a digital solution (and maybe get a hand-held computing solution for it like people have recommended for years) for searching if nothing else.
[09:23:39] <rmmh> ...you don't have a phone? wow
[09:24:12] <Nivim> I keep getting disgusted by the contracts, and then getting distracted with other problems. It helps I'm a hermit.
[09:24:35] <PapuaHardyNet> massive respect for you, Nivim. I wish to one day let go of my phone too
[09:25:29] <saturn2> you can get a contractless phone
[09:25:30] <Nivim> =] Thank you, although to me it feels more like being too rigid in my standards and stubborn in my choice.
[09:26:27] <Nivim> saturn2: Internet seems to think that means prepaid; same thing?
[09:26:41] <rmmh> no there are just carriers that do month-to-month
[09:27:50] <rmmh> most everything on this list-- https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-cheap-cell-phone-plans,review-4504.html

[09:28:46] <saturn2> anything postpaid will involve some sort of contract, but yes there are also ones that don't have onerous lock-in clauses
[09:29:50] <Nivim> (Now, aside from that, to figure out which fragments of conversation I accidentally dropped in the process of focusing on new messages.)
[09:31:33] <saturn2> PapuaHardyNet: what are you waiting for?
[09:33:41] <PapuaHardyNet> father needs my phone to access "my" bank account, whatsapp requires a phone
[09:34:35] <PapuaHardyNet> it's not that big of a deal though, I barely use my phone for much else, and don't pay for a contract anymore
[09:41:50] <Nivim> saturn2 (on that dropped 'what kind of herbal tea' question): Exactly which kind doesn't seem to matter much so long as it doesn't have sufficient side-effects (which might be normally considered their main effect) that I can't drink huge quantities of it; chamomile, echinacia, mint tend to be my go-tos, but the effect those teas are each known for always builds faster than their ability to make me feel
[09:41:52] <Nivim> less tired-- it's just those tend to all be the most tolerable.

[11:03:19] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: re: the earlier conversation about why jax while loop can't do reverse gradients while TF can. Bradbury says:
[11:03:19] <shawwwn> "TF can do it because TF allows a graph to allocate new memory
[11:03:19] <shawwwn> JAX jitted functions can only allocate a fixed amount of memory ahead of time
[11:03:19] <shawwwn> if you have a bound for the iteration count, it would be possible, but then you can also express it as a scan
[11:03:19] <shawwwn> the value of scan is specifically that it separates out the things that completely change on every step and the things where only a slice changes on every step
[11:03:20] <shawwwn> this means it can store a lot less for backprop than a totally general loop"
[11:03:57] <shawwwn> does that make sense? (I still don't really know.)
[11:04:29] <nshepperd2> hm ok
[11:10:46] <shawwwn> .note gwern that feel when nvidia updates their readme.md (https://github.com/NVlabs/alias-free-gan/commit/6eaf75751da2302c9fc56e8ac1ca3b904c1f3f0c) based on my baseless criticism (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27610750)

[11:25:32] <shawwwn> python3 -c 'import jax; print(jax.devices())' should show TPU devices
[11:25:49] <shawwwn> nshepperd: while I'm at it, you want a TPU too?
[11:25:58] <PapuaHardyNet> don't worry, I really value this, and probably will only use it for pytorch and jax experiments.
[11:27:12] <shawwwn> PapuaHardyNet: I recommend running `tmux new -s whatever` and running your experiments in that
[11:27:23] <shawwwn> since I often get disconnected from ssh, and screen sucks
[11:27:31] <shawwwn> but up to you; go wild
[11:28:14] <PapuaHardyNet> will do!
[11:28:54] <shawwwn> PapuaHardyNet: one thing I like to do is to connect to colab using the TPU. You can do that by clicking the dropdown arrow next to the connect button in colab, then clicking Local Runtime (https://i.imgur.com/yqXoQbK.png)

[11:29:44] <shawwwn> and also ssh in while passing the flag  -L 8888:localhost:8888
[11:31:10] <PapuaHardyNet> right, I'll try that. I originally thought of using ipython for terminal REPL acutally
[11:31:35] <shawwwn> ipython's nice too. or so I've heard
[11:31:52] <shawwwn> I often just run python3 repl's directly in tmux since I'm lazy tho
[11:32:29] <PapuaHardyNet> ipython is beautiful: type `torch.linalg.svd?` and you get the docs as a PAGER output
[11:32:55] <PapuaHardyNet> there's tab completion with popups for functions and file based arguments
[11:33:07] <shawwwn> help(torch.linalg.svd) gives the same thing, doesn't it?
[11:33:18] <shawwwn> and python3 gives tab completion too
[11:33:26] <shawwwn> but the popups would be neat
[11:33:39] <kuudes> good morning
[11:34:01] <shawwwn> morning!
[11:34:31] <PapuaHardyNet> yep, help() is the same.
[11:38:34] <PapuaHardyNet> oh one more benefit of ipython is the logging

[11:39:49] <PapuaHardyNet> there's a config option you can enable for ipython to automatically log every single input you add. It is very useful as a reference weeks later when you want to find out what amazing thing you did that you didn't implement in the codebase but now need it

[11:42:55] <PapuaHardyNet> shawwwn: yes, anything you type into the repl.
[11:43:04] <shawwwn> PapuaHardyNet: neat! how do you see the log?
[11:43:17] <feep[work]> dbohdan: anyway the point is, since the network recognizes both a picture of babbage and the string "babbage" as activators for "babbage"
[11:43:27] <feep[work]> then if you invert it, it will logically try to generate both or either.
[11:43:40] <feep[work]> in essence, the network has learned that humans sometimes label things with their name.
[11:43:44] <PapuaHardyNet> you just set the name of the file in the config, and ipython creates a file with that name in the working directory and appends the log in that file when you initialize ipython
[11:43:49] <dbohdan> feep[work]: Thanks for the link.  What is cool here is that the "Z" is a more organic part of the environment than "Babbage" was, almost like an Easter egg.
[11:44:05] <feep[work]> yeah the network doesn't really assign usage to regions, I don't think
[11:44:15] <feep[work]> like, "Z" activates a match for "Z3" and is thus gradiently favored
[11:44:27] <dbohdan> Hmm, I see
[11:44:33] <feep[work]> speculating, mind you

[17:25:19] <two2thehead> that too :V
[17:27:21] <Gurkenglas> Betawolf, that one tries to establish agreement on P iff Q so that once the disagreement is simple enough to investigate one side can be convinced; whereas the point of this exercise is just to prove that one side is wrong somewhere
[17:28:39] <Gurkenglas> or rather: any disagreement indicates that at least one side is wrong somewhere; moving to simpler disagreements should eventually find one side and one place it's wrong at
[17:28:42] <Betawolf> I don't see the distinction between 'one side can be convinced' vs 'prove that one side is wrong'.
[17:29:38] <nshepperd> Gurkenglas: isn't that proof by case analysis
[17:29:52] <Gurkenglas> if i say P and you say not P and we agree that P is Q and R and you say not R and I prove R, then that shows that you were wrong somewhere, but it doesn't show that your original position of not P was wrong
[17:30:59] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd, no. the closest terminology i can think of is ai safety via debate

[17:47:15] <nshepperd2> if HRT actually makes you capable of programming maybe it's worth it

For this reason, we explored pretraining a model on JFT, a large-scale, multi-labeled internal dataset with 300 million images spanning approximately 18,000 classes [73]...After large-scale pretraining on JFT [73], Perceiver IO produces results in the ballpark
[19:17:35] <feepbot> of strong models designed primarily for image classification. Perceiver IO is competitive with members of the Vision Transformer (ViT) [24] family without relying on 2D convolutions. But Perceiver IO is also compatible with convolutional preprocessing, and adding a simple 2D conv+maxpool preprocessing network leads to a moderate improvement in performance. We have incorporated
[19:17:35] <feepbot> several minor improvements to the training protocol reported in [35] and we use it for all experiments. See Appendix Section H for details. While neither the Perceiver and Perceiver IO incorporate any 2D spatial structure architecturally, they use positional features that inject 2D spatial information (see Sec. 3.2 and Appendix sec. D of [35]). By replacing these 2D position
[19:17:40] <feepbot> features with a fully learned position encoding (the same strategy used on language), we can learn an image classification model that is given no privileged information about the structure of images. The results of this model on ImageNet are shown in the table: to our knowledge, this is the best result by any model on ImageNet without 2D architectural or feature information. As
[19:17:40] <feepbot> discussed in [35] (sec. 4.1), this model is also permutation invariant.'

[22:34:16] <pompolic> VR training go brrr
[22:34:22] <pompolic> kojima was right
[22:35:28] <ggreer> VR driving training makes sense. we already do similar stuff for planes. it's not as good as actually driving/flying but the cost of mistakes becomes zero
[22:37:35] <two2thehead> yep
[22:37:41] <two2thehead> and you can have tiers of it
[22:38:03] <two2thehead> 1st tier would be you fritzing around with a commercially available headset
[22:38:19] <dbohdan> ggreer: Do you think it will be equally or less effective for motorcycles?  There have been motorbike arcade machines like https://arcadedirect.co.uk/manx-tt-twin-arcade-machine/.
[22:38:20] <Robomot> Manx TT Twin Arcade Machine | Driving Arcade Game | Arcade Direct (This is a great opportunity to own this beautifully restored Manx TT Twin Arcade Machine. Hire options also available of driving arcade games in the UK.)
[22:38:26] <two2thehead> 2nd would be an in-office headset with physical hardware, etc
[22:39:18] <ggreer> tilting on a motorcycle simulator doesn't make sense. the forces are balanced so you're always pushed "down" into the seat. you only hang off if you want to keep the bike more upright to avoid scraping (and eventually levering yourself off and having a lowside)
[22:41:42] <ggreer> a lot of VR simulation stuff is decent enough. you definitely learn a ton doing the actual thing, but it can give you some preparation. eg: gun simulators teach you about sight picture. with the right accessories they can teach you about proper grip. but they don't teach you about recoil or the extremely loud sounds and flashes (maybe with better accessories, it could, but at that point you might as well just train airsoft)
[22:42:01] <pompolic> i think one of the existing issues is lack of haptics
[22:42:19] <pompolic> and things like, swinging a vr sword is not the same as swinging a real sword
[22:42:36] <ggreer> honestly the biggest issue is that the people making the simulators are not experts in the real thing
[22:42:47] <pompolic> you cannot learn to balance the weight of it if there's no weight. and even if you made a prop, you'd have to simulate impacts
[22:42:50] <pompolic> that too
[22:43:08] <ggreer> real enthusiasts spend their time actually doing the thing. only in places where that thing is illegal (or really difficult to get into) do people write simulators
[22:43:15] <dbohdan> So they made the tilting in the game unrealistic to make it more exciting?
[22:43:25] <ggreer> yeah
[22:43:30] <dbohdan> I see
[22:43:37] <ggreer> also they didn't have displays at the time that could wrap around your field of view
[22:43:51] <pompolic> > real enthusiasts spend their time actually doing the thing. only in places where that thing is illegal (or really difficult to get into) do people write simulators
[22:43:54] <pompolic> story of my life
[22:44:44] <ggreer> I think the only exception to that rule is aircraft. flying aircraft is very expensive ($100/hr on the low end)
[22:45:21] <ggreer> but it doesn't take *that* much time and effort to get the necessary training, and people who want to stay sharp will use simulators
[22:45:42] <ggreer> there's also been more simulation for guns lately, thanks to tech costs decreasing and ammo costs increasing
[22:48:48] <Ralith> h3vr is good stuff

[22:50:19] <pompolic> i'm actually angling for a pilot license once i can fit it in the budget
[22:50:20] <ggreer> the best gun simulator I've played is gun club VR. it's much easier than actual shooting (thanks to the lack of recoil)
[22:50:42] <dbohdan> Ralith: https://store.steampowered.com/app/450540/Hot_Dogs_Horseshoes__Hand_Grenades/?  Looks fun.

[22:50:44] <ggreer> pistol whip would be a lot of fun if they ever added sights to their guns
[22:50:58] <Ralith> dbohdan: yep
[22:51:30] <pompolic> that's the musical rail shooter one, right?
[22:51:34] <ggreer> yes
[22:51:41] <Ralith> it's an enthusiast project, basically a big sack of minigames, some of which have very high replayability, combined with a gigantic pile of lovingly crafted hyperrealistic firearms
[22:52:01] <Ralith> guy's been adding to it continually for five years and there's a thriving community helping out
[22:53:23] <ggreer> looks like it might ship for the quest soon? I should check it out
