[01:50:12] <Joanna> I have just reaffirmed the stupidity of two factor authentication.. I had the misfortune of getting a new phone number yet it insists on sending the access code to the number I don’t have access to. I was told that the system has been updated with my new number but that doesn’t stop it.
[01:51:31] <Joanna> ...And there are idiots who want everything controlled by this garbage?
[02:14:30] <jessicara> the idea makes sense, the implementation is often bananas
[02:15:40] <Joanna> It’s a disaster in the making
[02:15:47] <jessicara> doesn't really help that people keep finding issues with the phone systems, and texts are usually where the 2nd authentication is done
[02:17:44] <jessicara> i recall some years ago ss7 had some serious issues
[02:17:46] <jan6> uh, phone number, is the WORST 2fa system possible
[02:17:52] <Joanna> They don’t take every possibility into consideration. What if someday people without cell phones aren’t allowed to have anything at all..
[02:18:23] <jessicara> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_System_No._7#Protocol_security_vulnerabilities
[02:18:39] <jan6> sms-based 2fa is only marginally better than no 2fa at all
[02:18:41] <jessicara> "a German mobile service provider, confirmed that the SS7 vulnerabilities had been exploited to bypass two-factor authentication to achieve unauthorized withdrawals from bank accounts"
[02:19:01] <jan6> phone networks were never built to be secure
[02:19:02] <Joanna> I already have one account which is super smart and won’t let me get rid of someone else’s cell phone number I have in their system
[02:19:22] <jan6> lol
[02:20:12] <jan6> imagine using such crappy things in the first place
[02:20:23] <Joanna> It won’t accept a non cell phone number
[02:21:07] <Joanna> The whole two factor authentication is really about cell phone number harvesting
[02:21:14] <jessicara> yeah it often is
[02:21:36] <jessicara> yet the people would think are looking for have multiple
[02:21:45] <Joanna> And I don’t have a cell phone and have no plans to get one.
[02:22:17] <jan6> only idiotic systems require phone number for 2fa, and give no other option
[02:22:35] <jessicara> otherwise, most of them
[02:22:46] <jan6> EVERYONE even relatively security-savy knows that phone systems are terrible, even *IF* you don't lose your number yourself
[02:23:28] <Joanna> What is there besides email or one of those devices that generates passwords every minute
[02:23:42] <jan6> there are some voip providers, but I'm pretty sure a considerable amount of services block those by default
[02:24:00] <jan6> otp passwords don't require no device
[02:24:11] <jessicara> not much support for these
[02:24:13] <jan6> technically, if you were fast enough, you could calculate them even with pen and paper
[02:24:23] <jan6> plenty of support from most significant services
[02:24:38] <jan6> and pleny of apps/programs
[02:24:39] <Joanna> Secure Id it was called
[02:24:47] <jessicara> never seen this supported
[02:24:49] <jan6> wtf is your "secure id"
[02:25:05] <jessicara> this kind thing only tends to exist here if i write it myself and use it myself
[02:25:10] <jessicara> banks don't
[02:25:11] <Joanna> It makes codes every minute on a small device
[02:25:28] <jan6> a separate device is one of the options
[02:25:36] <jan6> another is an app/program
[02:27:14] <Joanna> How would someone hack your account that is secured by code sent to phone? Do they need to know your phone number?
[02:27:56] <jan6> also over here at least we have national electronic ID, so there's no nonsense, you log in with your ID card, or optionally set up "smart-id" app, or a special SIM card for your phone (the latter utilized SIM cards' ability to run programs on-board, same way your bank card does crypto on-board (assuming you use chip-based card like a normal person)), which means banks don't use any nonsense method,
[02:27:57] <jan6> nor any insecure password login, to begin with
[02:28:57] <Joanna> National ID sounds like bad news. What country is this?
[02:29:56] <jan6> with phone number, they would generally need to know it, yes, but they could: intercept it, be it near you, or near the sender (which is way more likely), OR do social engineering, to do sim swapping, or similar thing
[02:30:01] <jan6> those two are the main ones I remember
[02:30:09] <Joanna> I really don’t like mandatory 2fa
[02:30:27] <jan6> it's mandatory as much as showing a passport is 2fa
[02:30:28] <jan6> lol
[02:31:57] <jan6> but I agree with mandatory 2fa being more trouble than it's worth
[02:33:30] <Joanna> It’s good for scaring people about “don’t ever get locked out of your account “
[02:33:36] <jan6> the only place where 2fa might be worth it, is your mailbox, because you can pretty much always just reset your password and 2fa through mail, either directly, or by contacting support, or something
[02:34:20] <jan6> also if you do sane backups, you won't get locked out, anyway, since you can just backup your 2fa codes, too ;P
[02:35:09] <jan6> (and SOME places, like google, even allow a "backup set of codes" you can print out or write down, and use when the 2fa key is los)
[02:35:10] <jan6> t
[02:35:12] <Joanna> Gmail asked me for a phone number I think new accounts require it.
[02:35:23] <jan6> uh, pretty sure no
[02:35:29] <jan6> it asks that for "suspicious" accounts
[02:35:32] <jan6> same with facebook
[02:36:03] <jan6> and of course, the less info you leak, the less "normal person" you are
[02:36:46] <jan6> also prepaid sim cards are generally a thing, anyway
[02:38:42] <jan6> over here you can literally get 'em for 1€/piece (which includes a bit of data/calls/sms out of the box, too), without any ID required, some places might require ID, I've heard, but would still be plenty enough for the 2fa, or signup places where you might not want your real number
[02:39:12] <Joanna> I think Facebook requires a phone number now. Luckily it is the phone number I lost :)
[02:39:25] <jan6> it does not
[02:39:31] <jan6> or at least it didn't, like a month ago
[02:39:34] <jan6> lol
[02:42:36] <Joanna> I think you can’t log in with new account without one.
[02:42:48] <Joanna> Maybe old accounts still work
[02:43:56] <jan6> nov 8 or so was when I made a new fb account, so a person would be able to talk to me, but not see my main one (although main one I barely use, purely for group chats with classmates/etc who don't want to use better options)
[02:44:10] <jan6> which didn't need no phone
[02:45:49] <jan6> but
[02:46:00] <jan6> when I tried to make one, a while ago, it DID ask for a number
[02:47:03] <jan6> if they detect you using a VPN, proxy, or just a suspicious IP (might happen with any NAT-ed IP? but more likely at shared net places, like school/work wifi, etc), they're gonna ask for a phone
[02:47:39] <jan6> or if your browser's suddenly changed location, or when you're using hardened browser settings, etc etc
[02:50:21] <Joanna> I don’t understand why anyone would want Facebook. It seems so shallow and asks such stupid questions like what music do you like.
[02:54:28] <jan6> because facebook's intended for friends who know each other IRL to connect and keep up with each other, and nonsense like that
[02:54:40] <jan6> or in general, use all your real info
[02:55:06] <jan6> like it then knows to reccommend "oh hey, like heavy metal? would you like to join this local heavy metal fangroup?"
[02:55:29] <jan6> or "hey, this guy went to your school and also likes The Simpsons, want to add as friend?"
[03:06:38] <Joanna> So first they harass everyone into having unlisted phone numbers using aggressive telemarketers then voila along comes Facebook to help you find people you know who have unlisted phone numbers   Or addresses not shown in public records anymore.
[04:03:32] *** Quits: elkclone (~elkclone@user/elkclone) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[04:17:09] <jan6> uh, you can declare your contact info "only me" or "only friends"
[04:17:23] <jan6> this isn't LinkedIn, after all
[04:19:18] <Joanna> Sure :) nobody else can possibly snoop it :)
[04:30:05] <jan6> unless they're working with facebook, they can't indeed ;P
[04:38:49] <Joanna> Why would Facebook need your contact info?
[04:39:07] <jan6> to contact you
[04:39:08] <jan6> duh
[04:39:13] <jan6> also to identify you
[04:39:29] <jan6> they're pretty clear that TECHNICALLY you're supposed to only use your real, and active, info
[04:39:43] <Joanna> You shouldn’t give contact info to people unless you want them calling you or showing up at your home or having other people do so.
[04:39:50] <jan6> duh
[04:40:20] <Hydragyrum> yeah my only FB acct had some fake info (because I don't want zucc having all that info) and it got deleted...
[04:40:21] <jan6> hence the privacy controls
[04:40:21] <Joanna> I’ve had people’s drunken friends contact me on more than one occasion
[04:40:40] <Joanna> Because my info was readily available
[04:41:10] <Joanna> The only privacy there is is not giving your information at all.
[04:41:29] <Joanna> Which includes not going to their website:)
[04:41:48] <Joanna> Why would anyone trust privacy controls?
[04:42:21] <jan6> you should always have SOME contact info for most people... but that doesn't mean it has to be direct, it can always be "tell mutual friend/aquintance X to tell Y that I need to talk to them about $TOPIC"
[04:42:42] <jan6> privacy controls work perfectly fine
[04:42:59] <jan6> facebook knows your info, and makes sure random people won't see it on your profile
[04:43:18] <jan6> similarly google protects you from everyone who isn't google
[04:43:25] <jan6> etc
[04:44:17] <jan6> obviously, if you can see the info yourself, then so can they (if they want to), which really applies to ALL services, anyway
[04:46:10] <jan6> unless you manually encrypt/decrypt your data, there's no way to know that e.g. protonmail *ISN'T* actually able to look through all your data whenever they want (due to, say...ALSO encrypting it with their key? or...just "borrowing" your private key, unbeknowst to you?)
[04:46:41] <jan6> on the internet, it's nearly impossible to remove info
[04:46:54] <jan6> so you should ALWAYS make sure to not give any that isn't REALLY needed
[04:49:45] <Joanna> Why would I trust big companies with strangers I don’t know?
[04:51:42] <Joanna> That reasoning of big companies are more trustworthy than random people has gotten us into a bad situation already. Ever heard of “data leak”?

[04:57:56] <jan6> it also just happens that NEITHER are particularly trustworthy

[04:59:13] <jan6> because while there are nice random people, there's also a lot of very-much-not-nice random people, especially when they know that I can't ever find out who they are

[18:29:52] <jan6> there are very few such corporations, but much more such individuals, where corporations are actually bound by laws and stuff, and more importantly than that, reputation, but individual people don't need to care about that nearly as much
[18:30:06] <jan6> and they are not above the law in any case
[18:30:32] <jan6> they just help lobby the law to bend it so they don't qualify for the limitations
[18:32:14] <jan6> just like even though microsoft's products might've been used in pretty much every company, including the government, they still got into antitrust trouble with IE and stuff, despite being top of the world
[18:33:33] <jan6> they can get away with SOME stuff, but usually that's by finding loopholes, and lobbying
[18:34:14] <jan6> although you could argue that lobbying IS control, it's not really CONTROL control, it's just bending things, not really reshaping them
[18:37:46] <jan6> if you agree to terms of service that they can use any content you publish with them, at any time, for any purpose, and then use it in a way that you hate and that goes completely against the intended meaning, then it's not them "having government control", just having good enough lawyers to set their rules, and to win against anyone who tries to argue
