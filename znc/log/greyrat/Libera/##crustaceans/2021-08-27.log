[00:11:11] <indigo> I like that the top post on HN is now "Work Hard"... a couple of days ago it was about dealing with burnout
[00:11:14] <indigo> Make up your mind, HN
[00:13:59] <manicennui> "Relying on intelligence alone to pull things off at the last minute may work for a while, but, generally speaking, at the graduate level or higher it doesn’t."
[00:14:02] <manicennui> Been working for me.
[00:14:32] <manicennui> But I assume this is about academia.
[00:15:30] <manicennui> Ah, seems like this is about mathematics academia in particular.
[00:17:32] <indigo> I think there are some good points in there
[00:18:40] <manicennui> indigo: I think the penultimate paragraph speaks to your point.
[00:19:24] <manicennui> "Generally speaking, it is better to try to arrange a few hours of high-quality working time, when one is motivated, energetic, prepared, and free from distraction, than to try to cram into one’s schedule a large number of hours of low-quality working time when one or more of the above four factors are not present."
[00:19:50] <indigo> +1; sometimes you really do need to sign off early
[00:20:03] <dasm> manicennui: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E9nJ_FsVoAAZDcs?format=jpg&name=large
[00:20:06] <dasm> o/
[00:20:07] <manicennui> That's like all the time for me these days.
[00:20:23] <dasm> "Sorry, I'm busy today" :)
[00:20:30] <manicennui> dasm: heh
[00:20:36] <manicennui> That is what I'm doing for my vacation.
[00:20:49] <manicennui> Friday I'm off, but I'm not flying out until Saturday.
[00:20:58] <manicennui> Then I return the following Saturday and have two days off.
[00:21:20] <indigo> You could try missing a meeting, and seeing if anyone pings you to attend
[00:21:20] <dasm> "I'm returning from vacation on Monday, and taking 4 days to recover" ;)
[00:21:21] <manicennui> I don't know how people do stuff like leave straight after work and get back home the night before work.
[00:21:43] <manicennui> I've even seen people fly in early and go to work that day.
[00:21:44] <indigo> I think those people end up taking a sick day the day after they get back
[00:21:47] <indigo> Oh wow
[00:22:26] <manicennui> I get wanting to spend as much time as possible somewhere, but it seems like it is kind of ruined if you immediately have to deal with work.
[00:22:44] <manicennui> Or maybe these sick fucks love work.
[00:23:24] <indigo> Hey, I loved work when I was younger
[00:23:36] <indigo> Spent all of Thanksgiving once working on a project
[00:23:39] <dasm> "work to live not live to work"
[00:24:29] <manicennui> I never have.
[00:24:48] <manicennui> There have been points when I have spent a lot of time on computing, but not because I cared about my job.

[04:10:59] <gwozniak> I dug into the code to verify the problem and... the code is so wrong I can't imagine anyone has ever tested it. Like, literally, the first instruction (this part is in assembly) invalidates everything in the documented spec.

[12:54:57] <_ak_> another question for my nordic / scandanivian friends
[12:55:02] <_ak_> how about american styled dip?
[12:55:25] <_ak_> vs snus? or with snus, is there no reason for something such as dip to exist out there?
[12:55:59] <_ak_> out here (in the us) it is very uncommon for women to part-take
[12:56:05] <_ak_> in chewing dip
[12:56:24] <gerikson> I read about dip
[12:56:46] <gerikson> I'm sure there are people here to like it
[12:57:28] <_ak_> i've noticed in the tech field smoking vaporized / juice tobacco is semi common
[12:57:46] <_ak_> i predict a resurgence in smokeless tobacco / rise in nicotine products
[12:58:19] <gerikson> the deal with portionssnus is that it's way more discreet than loose snuse
[12:58:42] <_ak_> how about you personally?
[12:59:28] <gerikson> I don't use any tobacco/nicotine products
[12:59:49] <gerikson> so people can use it without you noticing it
[12:59:57] <gerikson> a loose "prilla" is really gross imho
[13:02:04] <_ak_> my friend's wife -- a swedish embassy employee has portionssnus shipped to her from sweden
[13:02:19] <_ak_> they live in washington dc
[13:02:59] <gerikson> haha
[13:03:31] <_ak_> yeah -- it's fascinating to me
[13:04:43] <_ak_> dip or chewing tobacco is generally a baseball or blue-collar thing out here

[18:06:50] <gerikson> I've been eyeing to buy an old NUC from $work (money goes to charity) and they just told me I can't get the enterprise Windows tied to it... then they offered to install Linux on it!
[18:06:54] <gerikson> what service
[18:11:27] <dimadima> had never heard of NUCs until now
[18:11:30] <dimadima> little computers?
[18:11:38] <gerikson> yeah
[18:11:48] <gerikson> Intel form factor
[18:12:30] <gerikson> they were the main devel machines for some fucking stupid reason

[18:12:47] <dimadima> lol
[18:13:04] <dimadima> yeah they're fine if you want to ssh and develop in tmux/vim
[18:13:15] <gerikson> seriously this place can be penny wise, pound foolish
[18:13:19] <dimadima> or that cloud vscode thing github is offering
[18:13:33] <dimadima> getting developers tiny computers is... crazy
[18:14:20] <companion_cube> I was hoping small machines were still powerful :/
[18:14:21] <dimadima> no insight into the history of that decision?
[18:14:39] <gerikson> not really
[18:15:02] <gerikson> this was an entirely self-funded operation, no VC money
[18:15:12] <gerikson> so it was partly cultural
[18:15:30] <gerikson> now we're owned by an American company that's owned by PE soo...
[18:15:39] <prussian> I have this i.MX8M Mini EVK from $work and I don't use it for anything.
[18:15:50] <prussian> and the project that it was intended for stalled out
[18:16:03] <prussian> also, I don't like Yocto...
[18:16:26] <gerikson> I have a RPi 4
[18:16:29] <gerikson> which I like quite a lot
[18:16:36] <gerikson> but it's also quite flakey
[18:16:44] <prussian> sounds about right.
[18:17:15] <prussian> wtf would I do with a NUC...
[18:17:16] <prussian> lol
[18:17:27] <dimadima> i've been wondering that for 5 minutes now
[18:17:44] <gerikson> it's gonna be a torrenting box here
[18:17:44] <prussian> I would use it as a nice paperweight.
[18:17:50] <dimadima> my brother in law gave me a RPi of some generation and i have no idea what to do w/ it
[18:17:55] <dimadima> pi-hole but i've been too busy
[18:18:14] <dimadima> how many HDs can you connect to it for torrenting?
[18:18:27] <prussian> I started hacking with a few of the Cortex-M0s which seem more appropriate for actual, uh things
[18:18:42] <gerikson> dimadima: prolly gonna use an external one
[18:19:26] <prussian> I had an idea of a wearable compass. that uses small haptic motors that would tell you where north is. maybe add a BT LE feature so you can plug in like coordinates and the compass would point you to like the next waypoint. hands and eye free navigation...
[18:19:35] <prussian> but I suck at motors I guess
[18:19:45] <dimadima> gerikson: makes sense yes
[18:20:50] <gerikson> already using the Rpi for that tbh
[18:21:16] <dimadima> anyone use funkwhale/subsonic forks?
[18:21:31] <dimadima> like airsonic
[18:23:47] <dimadima> i really want to set up one of these home media servers
[18:25:11] <prussian> I just use minidlna
[18:25:13] <prussian> idk
[18:27:23] <dimadima> if you use funkwhale/subsonic you can get android/ios apps to sync stuff from the service
[18:27:32] <prussian> I got the stupid nonfree device on a hdmi port, hit the dlna, watch the crap
[18:27:34] <prussian> o
[18:28:01] <dimadima> yeah it's a bit more than dlna
[18:28:16] <dimadima> funkwhale takes it further by allowing you to federate your library w/ other ppl
[18:28:33] <prussian> interesting.
[18:28:34] <dimadima> but i wonder how well that works
[18:28:39] <prussian> never heard of it
[18:28:40] <dimadima> (hence asking :))
[18:30:33] <prussian> fair
[18:30:45] <dimadima> my real dream is a torrent client that is backed by cloud storage
[18:31:09] <dimadima> "cloud storage" would suck because the major providers charge a lot of egress
[18:31:14] <dimadima> but some form of cheap remote storage
[18:31:36] <dimadima> so you torrent locally, thereby taking responsibility for copyright stuff
[18:31:51] <dimadima> but then the torrent pieces get synced in an encrypted state to remote storage
[18:32:18] <dimadima> your client keeps some cache of pieces locally, and when something is requested to seed that you don't have, they are retrieved and cached
[18:32:24] <dimadima> but by and large your stuff is remote
[18:32:35] <gerikson> local storage is quite cheap tho
[18:32:49] <dimadima> it's not the cheapness it's the hassle
[18:33:08] <dimadima> my problem has always been that i get some X terabyte HD
[18:33:27] <dimadima> i'm always like "okay, i need to get 2, so i can mirror them in case one fails"
[18:33:41] <dimadima> (which, haha, isn't even a true backup, but hey, these are torrents so whatever)
[18:33:57] <dimadima> so i get 2, but then inevitably it fills up. and on and on it goes
[18:34:36] <prussian> you must go the way of btrfs and #yolo storage
[18:34:52] <prussian> keep adding more devices.
[18:35:08] <dimadima> i agree but that does still suck
[18:35:10] <gerikson> most of the stuff I grab is pretty ephemeral
[18:35:37] <dimadima> yep, same here, but at the same time, i don't want the problem of storage to dictate what's ephemeral and what's not
[18:35:47] <dimadima> i'll delete coooking show EPs i downloaded for a friend myself
[18:35:49] <prussian> storage sucks
[18:35:57] <dimadima> i don't need storage failures to do that for me :)
[18:35:57] <prussian> hate it. simple.
[18:36:03] <dimadima> yep. it sucks: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27837570

[18:36:52] <prussian> wish corona would end so I can go to India this time this century.
[18:37:03] <gerikson> but otoh I think streaming has undercut a lot of torrenting's appeal

[18:40:01] <prussian> gerikson: books are good
[18:40:02] <prussian> what kind
[18:40:02] <dimadima> it's $3.50
[18:40:11] <prussian> just generic entertainment, knowledge?
[18:40:13] <dimadima> how do ppl torrent books?
[18:40:16] <prussian> idk
[18:40:23] <dimadima> i've only been on one tracker and it closed a long time ago
[18:40:34] <prussian> I need access to the academic crap
[18:40:37] <dimadima> books are kind of too small for torrenting unless you get packs, which is unideal in its own way
[18:40:40] <gerikson> prussian: basicallyt everthng
[18:40:40] <prussian> but scihub just works
[18:40:41] <prussian> ig
[18:40:46] <prussian> nice
[18:41:37] <prussian> ya book drm annoys me
[18:41:39] <prussian> don't blame
[18:41:56] <prussian> no starch press is basically the kind of books I buy nowadays
[18:45:00] <dimadima> hadn't heard of that. looks good
[18:45:53] <edm> scihub people need a nobel prize
[18:46:00] <edm> they have transformed our industry
[18:46:12] <edm> well not mine because engineers seem to have a problem with doing lit reviews
[18:46:16] <dimadima> i believe it's this one russian woman
[18:46:37] <dimadima> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28100744
[18:46:38] <buttsbot> Sci-Hub is fundraising | Hacker News
[18:46:55] <prussian> ya. last book I bought was Learn You a Haskell for Great Good, I bought "How Linux Works, 3rd Ed." for my Mentee.
[18:46:56] <edm> but for those of us in our industry that like to look at what's published before tryign something new, it's been utterly transformative
[18:46:59] <prussian> good stuff.
[18:47:13] <prussian> edm: this
[18:47:27] <dimadima> oh they publish "Learn You a Haskell for Great Good"
[18:47:29] <companion_cube> the scihub lady is a hero
[18:47:42] <edm> also today i spent 5 hrs looking hunting a bug having faithfully implemented the mathematics described in the $250 text book work bought me
[18:47:45] <prussian> I basically got a few articles about corrosion sensing thinks to sci-hub. helped a lot
[18:47:52] <dimadima> haskell seems awesome...
[18:48:11] <dimadima> so many high quality projects built w/ haskell... hasura comes to mind for example
[18:48:40] <edm> and then found a rip of the subsequent edition as i was in town and hadn't brought it with me, and it turns out there was an additional term in the printed edition in an equation in error that wasn't there in the rip i found of the subsequent edition
[18:48:42] <prussian> ya it's ok. they need to clean up the prelude though
[18:48:50] <dimadima> prussian: i helped a farmer on twitter get an Ag paper from the 80s that was behind a paywall for $24.99 lol
[18:48:53] <edm> so my numbers were suddenly not out by a factor of a hundred and something
[18:48:56] <dimadima> by pointing this farmer to sci-hub
[18:48:58] <prussian> dimadima: nice.
[18:49:31] <edm> also so many papers are just junk
[18:49:36] <prussian> lol this
[18:49:48] <prussian> i don't blame them. they gotta get their doctorate somehow.
[18:49:56] <edm> can't pay AIAA $45 a time or whatever for just half-assed crap in the hope that one in twenty will be useful
[18:50:06] <prussian> So true.
[18:50:13] <dimadima> absurd, right
[18:50:27] <edm> sp yes, sci-hub has changed the world
[18:50:32] <edm> NTRS is good and legal too
[18:50:34] <edm> for spacey things
[18:50:39] <prussian> anyhow. ya I like No starch. good stuff. can get the physical and ebook.
[18:50:42] <prussian> no drm crap
[18:52:38] <prussian> dimadima: well if you want to learn you a haskell, learn you a haskell does a good job. the guy hosts it for free on a website too
[18:52:41] <prussian> if you don't want to buy
[18:53:58] <dimadima> thank you prussian. yes i will when i have some more time. i do want to learn it
[18:54:13] <dimadima> also purescript looked great a few years ago, though no idea if it ever kept momentum
[18:54:31] <dimadima> i would buy that book, so many ppl recommend it.
[18:59:05] <prussian> is purescript that pure functional compile to js thing?
[19:01:24] <dimadima> yeah my impression was that it was a haskell-inspired language that compiled to JS
[19:01:44] <dimadima> PureScript is a strongly-typed, purely-functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript. It can be used to develop web applications, server side apps, and also desktop applications with use of Electron. Its syntax is mostly comparable to that of Haskell. In addition, it introduces row polymorphism and extensible records.[2] Also, contrary to Haskell, PureScript adheres to a strict
[19:01:50] <dimadima> evaluation strategy.
[19:02:18] <dimadima> last stable release 0 days ago according to wikipedia
[19:04:17] <dimadima> i've been really enjoying typescript but its limited by its third party runtimes (node, browsers)
[19:04:33] <dimadima> i'm excited to try deno some time though
[19:05:03] <dimadima> having come from Java/C# though, the language and type system in TS is so nice and flexible
[19:05:14] <dimadima> but i have no experience with things like OCaml/Haskell
[19:13:02] <ngoldbaum> managed to find all my coffee crap in like 8 different moving boxes
[19:13:10] <ngoldbaum> note to self: pack all coffee crap in one box
[19:13:42] <dimadima> yeah got to have a box that's like **will need this asap when i arrive**
[19:22:54] <ngoldbaum> lol just got another long email in japanese about the mt gox settlement, guess that’s still going
[19:23:40] <ngoldbaum> i had a tiny amount of bitcoin left in there it’s not worth wading through the bureaucracy to get it back if i even get anything

[19:48:52] <prussian> dimadima: interesting purescript. maybe I'll update some of my frontends with it. see how it goes.
[19:48:53] <prussian> tyh
[19:49:01] <prussian> ngoldbaum: what kind of coffee you got?
[19:49:04] <prussian> or gear
[19:49:05] <prussian> I should say
[19:49:41] <ngoldbaum> i make it in a chemex
[19:50:02] <ngoldbaum> so i need a scale, grinder, filters, the actual chemex, some mugs, the beans…
[19:51:05] <prussian> gangsta.
[19:57:47] <prussian> ngoldbaum: I just got a 1Zpresso K-Plus straight from Taiwan and I usually use a Clara French Press myself.
[19:59:01] <ngoldbaum> cool, any particular reason you went with that instead of an electric burr grinder?
[19:59:05] <wrl> aeropress gang
[20:00:08] <prussian> ngoldbaum: lol, some norgie nut I know was talking about geting a JX-Pro and he seems to know all about the hot whatevers, so I looked at it, said, looks cool, saw some yt videos and just went with it. It isn't loud and obnoxious and it doesn't take too much counter space.
[20:00:12] <prussian> that's basically it
[20:00:34] <prussian> and the time I'm grinding is about as long as it takes the water to heat up anyhow
[20:00:35] <ngoldbaum> i’m too lazy in the morning to turn a crank :p
[20:04:51] *** glider_ is now known as glider
[20:04:55] <prussian> damn
[20:05:13] <prussian> it isn't the most pleasant. those Taiwanese guys lied too. 35g my ass.
[20:05:16] <prussian> more like 25g
[20:05:32] <prussian> but it does indeed work very well, consistency wise

[21:13:49] <indigo> Why use nixos when you can anthos + kubernetes + helm + istio
[21:13:54] <indigo> Docker docker docker redis
[21:14:49] <Geekingfrog> anthos ?
[21:17:52] <indigo> IIUC, Anthos is something that lets you run your stuff on multiple clouds
[21:19:16] <dimadima> prussian: excellent
[21:19:24] <companion_cube> herd your k8s instances
[21:19:31] <companion_cube> (taht sounds damn awful)
[21:20:04] * ngoldbaum hands companion_cube a vax mainframe
[21:20:18] <companion_cube> sorry, my religion makes me antivax
[21:21:00] <gerikson> lol
[21:25:55] * ngoldbaum hands companion_cube a horse paste mainframe
[21:25:55] <indigo> I was looking into setting up Navidrome, and then I thought: should I set it up using Kubernetes on GKE, with my music collection backed by object storage?
[21:26:02] <indigo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/0vrWkOCO/image.png
[21:26:30] <companion_cube> is "object storage" just another name for remote file systems? :)
[21:26:44] <bkero> Hardly
[21:26:51] <bkero> Try having an empty directory on object storage
[21:27:10] <dasm> just use empty object? ;)
[21:27:20] <dasm> let's create a "0" object
[21:27:23] <bkero> Try that in S3
[21:27:33] <indigo> Yeah there are differences... IIUC you can't read part of a file in object storage
[21:27:33] <prussian> indigo: because I'm not as hardcore as icy who's whole home setup is kubes
[21:27:40] <companion_cube> bkero: interesting
[21:27:45] <companion_cube> that still seems like a minor difference
[21:28:39] <indigo> Oh nvm. I guess you can using the Range header
[21:28:40] <bkero> The idea is that directories or any sort of nested hierarchy doesn't actually exist in object stores
[21:28:46] <prussian> you can't use http range reqs on s3?
[21:28:57] <prussian> I thought you could...
[21:29:02] <bkero> It's all just window dressing on top as opposed to actual data strctures
[21:29:15] <prussian> ya...
[21:29:23] <bkero> and some things don't translate well
[21:29:34] <prussian> hierachy bad anyhow
[21:29:45] <bkero> Then again part of the problem is that S3, the dominant example, has its own set of brain damage that isn't representative of all object stores.
[21:30:19] <prussian> I am no cloud storage zen master, curious how bad S3 is though.

[21:49:29] <Xe> Geekingfrog: anthos is what you want to use when you hate yourself so much that others need to suffer too
[21:50:59] <indigo> I thought that was Kubernetes
[22:28:26] <Geekingfrog> but I see "Achieve up to 4.8x ROI within 3 years" with anthos !
[22:28:38] <Geekingfrog> and that's something from the our lord & savior google
[22:30:06] <kline> *dabs on hr*
[22:30:20] <kline> finally got off that annoying email list i should never have been on in the first place
[22:30:35] <Geekingfrog> what list ?
[22:30:35] <companion_cube> what about "down to"
[22:30:39] <companion_cube> I like to have a lower bound
[22:30:51] <companion_cube> "achieve down to 0.1% ROI within 6 months"
[22:30:55] <kline> after like 3 months of them ignoring my requests to be removed, i snapped and hit reply-all on a passing email and asked the 700 person list to be removed
[22:31:03] <kline> shut down my laptop and went for the weekend
[22:31:17] <kline> just checked now, 73 new emails but they removed me from the list, so i guess i know what works now
[22:31:31] <Geekingfrog> :D
[22:32:06] <dasm> kline: it sounds like emails: "please don't use reply-all in your emails" which is repeated every. freaking. time.

[22:32:19] <dasm> i'm not getting. why people don't use BCC?
