[02:11:29] <ajak> imo they're both the kinds of distros to hold on to ancient software and patch into oblivion (and that can lead to unique vulnerabilities that aren't in other distros)

[09:05:04] <Hash> Also, run ssh on a non standard port, for extra osbscurity
[09:05:24] <Hash> and perhaps even lock down your ssh to your user/subnet/isp IP/netowrk or few of them
[09:05:43] <Hash> My servers can only be logged into from my home ipv4 and my home /64 ipv6
[09:06:09] <Seirdy> nonstandard ports are not a good security measure. it might save you some headache but it shouldn't be what makes the difference.
[09:06:19] <Hash> And in case someone find outs your non standard port, redirect fail2ban on that port.
[09:06:34] <Hash> That's a false ideation within the security world.
[09:06:42] <Hash> Obscurity is absolutely security.
[09:06:54] <Hash> I give this analogy/argument quite often and it makes sense to people.
[09:07:09] <Hash> The best defense in nature is camoflague. Concealment.
[09:07:25] <Hash> To hide in plain sight. If predetors cannot even tell you're there, they can't do anything.
[09:07:44] <Hash> Obviously it wont' deter a targeted attack, but bots looking for 22 open, it will absolutely thwart that.
[09:07:49] <Seirdy> yes but port scanning is like the first thing an attacker will do if they notice
[09:07:58] <Hash> So obscurity isn't security sure. But it does add to it and it's a large part of it.
[09:08:45] <Seirdy> port scanning is kind of standard practice even for bots. service enumeration and scanning comes first, then exploitation.
[09:08:54] <Hash> Correct
[09:09:01] <Hash> Use port knocking or firewall.
[09:09:09] <Hash> Change port too, why not. Doesn't make my life harder.
[09:09:22] <Hash> But it does lessen the noise in logs.
[09:09:30] <Seirdy> so you shouldn't count on it for anything. do it if you feel like but don't tell yourself that you're doing anything more than buying time.
[09:10:01] <Hash> I as a man of science cannot buy into blanket statements like that.
[09:10:01] <Seirdy> we already have better solutions out there
[09:10:19] <Hash> Every since I started adding obscurity to my seucirty models, I've noticed a fraction of the noise I used to get in my logs.
[09:10:44] <Hash> Once again, it should not be relied upon as a sole means of security.
[09:11:15] <Seirdy> yes they'll clean out the low hanging fruit. so will more effective solutions. the difference is that an actual threat will just hop over the half-measures like they aren't even there.
[09:11:18] <Hash> It adds and embellishes. It deters some people. What %, we can't say.
[09:11:31] <Hash> Seirdy | yes they'll clean out the low hanging fruit <- That!
[09:11:36] <Hash> You found the words for me!
[09:11:38] <Hash> :)
[09:11:59] <Hash> You're right.
[09:12:29] <Hash> It is also a good idea to give them less targets. If someone is determined, you can't really stop that. But just passserbys, you want to hide from them.
[09:12:34] <Seirdy> you can either clear the low hanging fruit without actually solving the problem, or just fix the problem. if the obscurity makes any meaningful difference it means that you haven't locked things down
[09:12:37] <Hash> You don't want to be visible to everyone.
[09:12:49] <Hash> Even innature camoflauge only works against certain perdators and not all predators.
[09:13:02] <Hash> We can see through a lot of camoflauge designed for other predators.
[09:13:12] <Hash> Likewise in security.
[09:13:29] <Seirdy> look at it this way: you can either nuke a fort, nuke a fort then drop a grenade, or just drop a grenade. why would you even bother with a grenade when you have the nuke? sure it'll take care of low-hanging fruit, but *why*?
[09:13:31] <Hash> You hide from some predators, but not all. And the ones you do hide from, is less nuisance. So it's a good thing.
[09:13:58] <Seirdy> security isn't a game of predator and prey. we're talking about literal machines here.
[09:14:04] <Hash> I'm not sure I can agree to that analogy.
[09:14:12] <Hash> Nukes are bad due to fallout and health reasons.
[09:14:22] <Hash> You not only damage your apponent, you damage yourself.
[09:14:28] * Seirdy sighs
[09:14:33] <Hash> Perhaps a different analogy would be more useful.
[09:14:44] <Seirdy> look you know what i mean. you either solve the problem or you just delay solving it.
[09:15:00] <Seirdy> if you lock down your ssh configs it won't matter that everyone can see your port
[09:15:04] <Hash> I advise sprinkling obscuity into your security model.
[09:15:10] <Hash> It helps.
[09:15:28] <CoJaBo> Seirdy: If the nuke's a dud, you might still get a kill with the grenade :P
[09:15:35] <Seirdy> i'd only advise changing your port because if you notice that doing so makes a significant difference, you'd know you've failed
[09:15:38] <Hash> CoJaBo: also excellent point.
[09:15:51] <CoJaBo> Offense in depth.
[09:16:17] <Hash> Seirdy: right now my server has 443/80/25 open. And 25 doesn't advertise AUTH.
[09:16:30] <Hash> 22 isn't visible to anyonle.
[09:16:44] <Hash> Runa  -p1-65536 and you still won't find anything.
[09:16:50] <Hash> Use port knockking or firewalls.
[09:17:01] <Hash> Try not to leave 22 open unless you want needlessly huge logs.
[09:17:12] <Hash> Also, Personal Computing.
[09:17:19] <Hash> Personal. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.
[09:18:23] <Hash> The only noise I have now is in exim logs, people trying the AUTH command when it's not advertised, to protocol errors.
[09:18:44] <Hash> No way to kill SMTP noise. Can kill all other noise but that damn SMTP wont' shut up. People won't stop! Haha
[09:19:19] <Hash> They are trying to AUTH on 25 and AUTH is only advertised on SSL, not STARTLS even.
[09:19:29] <Hash> STARTTLS is only for MTA to MTA communication.
[09:20:54] <Seirdy> or you could just not log events you find useless.
[09:21:16] <Seirdy> those bruteforce attempts are only an issue if they increase your load, since you shouldn't be bruteforceable
[09:21:29] <Seirdy> and you're using fail2ban so that'll fix that
[09:21:54] <Seirdy> what are you protecting yourself from?
[09:24:09] <Seirdy> try bruteforcing yourself. it's a fun exercise. see what actually works.

[10:18:51] <NeoWakeUp> quick question, trying to learn how network's but at the same time learning c++, am i wasting my time in learning how to program or the basics of programming when i should be putting all my attention on security and networking?
[10:20:00] <mnemon> no, knowing how the programs work will help a lot with understanding the other bits
[10:22:35] <NeoWakeUp> mnemon: okay perfect thank you! i heard someone mention "try bruteforcing yourself" wich i've never tried since im obv. still new but it caught my attention lol

[10:42:18] <rudi_s> NeoWakeUp: Could be, just wanted mention that it's not obvious what it means.
[10:42:38] <rudi_s> And if you chose proper passwords you'll never have to do that because you know they can't be (realistically) brute-forced.
[10:42:55] <rudi_s> (Using a password manager is an important step because it reduces the number of passwords you have to remember.)
[10:44:40] <NeoWakeUp> rudi_s: well all my password's are in a password manager YES and they are all generated by the grattes pass word manager in my opinion "PASS" By Gnu, and is encrypted with my gpg key

[10:47:46] <rudi_s> Sounds good (don't know grattes though)

[10:48:22] <tomreyn> and '"PASS" By Gnu' would then be the software
[10:48:37] <tomreyn> written by a gnu
[10:48:58] <NeoWakeUp> tomreyn: Yes indeed
[10:49:58] <tomreyn> you know what is Gnu is? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildebeest
[10:49:59] <websec> ^ Wildebeest, also called gnu, are antelopes of the genus Connochaetes and native to Eastern and Southern Africa. They belong to the family Bovidae, which includes true antelopes, cattle, goats, sheep, and other even-toed horned ungulates.
[10:52:13] <tomreyn> i meant to write: You know what *a* Gnu is?
[10:52:27] <rudi_s> Oh, right
[10:52:28] <tomreyn> I'm sure you were referring to https://www.passwordstore.org/ though.
[10:52:29] <websec> ^ Pass: The Standard Unix Password Manager
[10:53:14] <NeoWakeUp> I actually have never looked that up before but i mean GNU free software movement

[11:03:33] <tomreyn> NeoWakeUp: I should explain this properly. While Gnu is an animal, and I'm not sure what you read, or what made you say '"PASS" By Gnu', the "pass" software is written by Jason A. Donenfeld (who is also known for a bunch of other great software, incl. wireguard), and is licensed under the (GNU) GPLv2.0. Here, "GNU" refers to the 'GNU Project' (https://www.gnu.org/), which developed this software license.
[11:07:20] <NeoWakeUp> tomreyn: if im being honest before using or downloading a software i always check the license if the license is not under GPLv2.0. i search for alternatives with the license under GPLv2.0.

[21:58:09] <rudi_s> Seirdy: I see, thanks. Personally I don't think brute force is really necessary as you can just configure it to withstand a possible brute-force. Also many issues won't be identified by an experiment and only be configuring the hosts securely.
[21:58:45] <Seirdy> agreed, the reason i brought it up was to demonstrate that certain simple measures are sufficient.

[22:19:12] <catbeard> and disable password auth, disable remote root login
[22:21:14] <MadCamel> or make sure the ssh private key is 2-factor secure - smartcard suggested - and allow remote root login. then remove the suid bit from all binaries on the remote machine. this reduces attack surface.

[22:27:29] <Seirdy> yes disable passwords login, disable root login, enable 2fa. I'd personally rather use dnssec to store pubkeys: https://blog.cloudflare.com/flexible-secure-ssh-with-dnssec/

[23:00:32] <rudi_s> I like remote root login (with keys) and see no reason to deactivate it for security reasons.
[23:01:50] *** Joins: pyrrhus (~pyrrhus@user/pyrrhus)
[23:08:15] <MadCamel> yep. it's not like the service wouldn't be running anyway. and it's unlikely disabling root login would prevent any type of exploit.

[23:11:15] <MadCamel> Just have to keep the key secure. Using sudo or su to get to root it's key+password on the remote system. Something you have, something you know. Root keys can meet that requirement as well. Just don't leave them sitting unencrypted in ssh-agent and use agent forwarding or anything silly..
[23:12:23] <MadCamel> It's amazing the inertia that's behind a lot of bad/useless practices.
