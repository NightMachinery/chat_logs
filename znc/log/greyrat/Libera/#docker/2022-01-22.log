[08:11:45] <wroathe> Potentially kind of a long shot, but I figure there might be someone in here that has experienced the same thing. On docker for windows I'm having trouble establishing network connectivity with both my windows containers and Hyper-V VMs utilizing the default switch on a corporate laptop that's been locked down by group policies. I've determined that the firewall is dropping packets inbound from the guest 
[08:11:51] <wroathe> to the host, and I think I've identified that there's a firewall rule that requires that network interface to have a "network category"
[08:12:18] <wroathe> And as far as I can tell that's talking about Window's idea of a network connection profile, where you can categorize the network adapter as public/private/domain authenticated
[08:13:18] <wroathe> Just to test this hypothesis I'm trying to set the connection profile of Hyper-V's default switch utilizing a command like Set-NetConnectionProfile, but Set-NetConnectionProfile requires that the adapter ALREADY have a connection profile (it's just a command to UPDATE an EXISTING connection profile)
[08:13:45] <wroathe> Does anyone here know how I might CREATE a connection profile in windows for an existing virtual network adapter?
[08:14:44] <wroathe> I know that isn't strictly speaking a docker specific question, but there's a possibility that someone that uses Docker for Windows in an enterprise environment has run into this

[13:01:59] <dyslexicat> Hi everyone, I am trying to run docker containers inside dind but I also need to mount the docker socket from the host. However, when I run "/sbin/init" as my entrypoint the "/var/run" path gets overridden and the socket gets lost. All of this makes sense since it's tmpfs but do you have any idea how I can persist my docker socket after "/sbin/init" or any other solutions for this use case?

[20:54:46] <rawtaz> you can run docker-compose from wherever you want - what matters is that the docker client has access to the docker socket or endpoint url
[20:55:11] <DoofusCanadensis> just need to add docker-compose to that container... iirc it still installs separately
[20:55:45] <rawtaz> please note that a user having access to that effectively has root on the system where the docker daemon runs (assuming you run docker daemon as root, which is the default)
[20:57:07] <pycurious> DoofusCanadensis: so when I do a docker-compose xyz.yaml from inside a docker container - the docker-compose run is equivalent to running things on the base OS? 
[20:57:50] <rawtaz> docker-compose is just a wrapper around docker
[20:57:55] <DoofusCanadensis> depends on how the container is set up to use docker
[20:58:12] <DoofusCanadensis> as rawtaz said, you can have the container map to the hosts docker daemon
[20:58:44] <ikke> --volumes /var/lib/docker:/var/lib/docker
[20:59:03] <pycurious> how should i set up a docker container so that it runs docker-compose easily from inside...?
[20:59:08] <pycurious> ikke: is that for me? 
[20:59:11] <ikke> yes
[21:00:05] <pycurious> thanks! 
[21:00:18] <ikke> But do heed the warning that rawtaz gave
[21:01:05] <rawtaz> pycurious: what problem are you trying to solve? why do you want a container to control your entire docker setup, all its containers, and be ablet o have root on the server?
[21:01:43] <pycurious> ikke: In my case - both are running as root right now - so security is not what I am worried about at this point
[21:02:03] <pycurious> rawtaz: I have a docker container - which needs to run a program that is also wrapped inside a docker container
[21:02:20] <pycurious> so just need to run a docker-compose from inside a container
[21:02:27] <pycurious> Both can run on the same OS 
[21:02:44] <rawtaz> hmm
[21:03:41] <pycurious> Let me call these X and Y. So I run X -> Which needs to run Y. Both can run on the base OS
[21:04:12] <rawtaz> yeah
[21:04:55] <rawtaz> it would probably be more secure to do it differently, but it sounds like security isnt a concern in this case?
[21:05:36] <pycurious> rawtaz: nope - no security concern right now
[21:05:40] <rawtaz> ok :D
[21:05:50] <pycurious> these are all internal machines
[21:05:53] <rawtaz> sometimes its nice to not having to bother about that heh
[21:06:02] <rawtaz> yeah they are, i bet. until they arent :-)
[21:06:51] <pycurious> rawtaz: what is a better way to do this - security wise? 
[21:07:02] <pycurious> rawtaz: I agree - someday a hacker can get inside a private machine :)

[21:08:37] <rawtaz> im honestly not aware of what docker-native ways there are to do such a simple thing as to start another container from a first container.
[21:08:58] <rawtaz> off the top of my head, writing a specific script that does just that, and calling that or signalling to it, would probably be the most secure way
[21:09:16] <rawtaz> e.g. have a bind mount to the host where if you drop a certain file, that other container is started by something on the host
[21:09:58] <rawtaz> or an intermediate contianer that does have access to the docker socket, but thats less secure so not a first option
[21:10:31] <rawtaz> theres like tons of ways. you could use a queue or kv store as well.
[21:10:48] <rawtaz> in general i think the key point is that instead of calling directly, you should just signal that you want the other one started.

[21:19:07] <DoofusCanadensis> depends on whether you're starting a container or creating it at the time
[21:19:19] <DoofusCanadensis> could use ansible to control the host
[21:24:31] <DoofusCanadensis> but if it's just starting the container... oh, secure your docker instance with ssh and use that with your docker-compose call

[23:02:15] <wonderer> hey all
[23:02:29] <wonderer> what are the steps to retain my docker container data
[23:02:45] <wonderer> so its not lost when host or container is restarted?
[23:03:09] <ikke> wonderer: put it into volumes our bind mounts
[23:03:19] <wonderer> hmmm
[23:03:40] <wonderer> i am not sure what you mean
[23:03:45] <wonderer> or how to go about it
[23:04:09] <ikke> note that just restarting the container or host should not result into loss of data in containers, unless it's written on tmpfs
[23:04:20] <wonderer> great
[23:04:30] <ikke> Recreating the container would
[23:04:41] <wonderer> just that i see a few google result showing ppl loosing their data upon a container been restarted
[23:05:50] <ikke> https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#mount-volume--v---read-only
[23:05:54] <DoofusCanadensis> probably recreated their container instead of simply restarting it
