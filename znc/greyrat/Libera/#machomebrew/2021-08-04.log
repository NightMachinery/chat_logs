[20:21:34] <mrec> why is it doing that twice?!
[20:22:04] <tdsmith> weird
[20:23:28] <mrec> that's what I think for 3 hours already ..
[20:24:09] <mrec> solving one riddle after each other .. 
[20:25:42] <mrec> and the solution was rather easy
[20:26:05] <mrec> ok that one I was able to install next problem again
[20:26:10] <mrec> Error: Operation already in progress for opencascade@7.5.0.formula
[20:26:10] <mrec> Another active Homebrew process is already using opencascade@7.5.0.formula.
[20:26:11] <mrec> Please wait for it to finish or terminate it to continue.
[20:27:48] <tdsmith> you could try clearing out /usr/local/var/homebrew/locks/
[20:28:02] <mrec> didn't work
[20:28:04] <mrec> tried already
[20:31:48] <mrec> is there a way to force it?
[20:32:04] <mrec> brew install --only-dependencies -f freecad  is not doing anything
[20:34:04] <mrec> or I'd just uncomment the option where it jumps to that error
[20:37:13] <mrec> oh yes
[20:37:14] <mrec>    2 /usr/local/var/homebrew/locks/opencascade@7.5.0.formula.lock
[20:37:23] <mrec>     puts @path
[20:37:30] <mrec> for some reason it had opencascade 2 times in the list
[20:37:44] <mrec> dirty workaround just ignore the lock
[20:56:41] <mrec> homebrew is not made for freecad.
[20:56:51] <mrec> neither the other way around
[21:00:58] <mrec> 4 hours already... that shit homebrew freecad update
[21:02:48] <mrec> first this shit netgen library won't install then it builds and is still incomplete how stupid are those developers
[21:03:57] <mrec> they should be paid for not touchingn any code
[21:13:19] <bn_work> hi, is it possible to install 2 different versions of a cellar package?
[21:13:47] <bn_work> ex:  openapi-generator, I wish to keep my current version + install the latest ver
[21:14:14] <tdsmith> it's not supported
[21:14:58] <bn_work> or do I need to manually back it up if I want that
[21:14:59] <bn_work> ?
[21:15:10] <tdsmith> that might work
[21:15:43] <tdsmith> er, it might work based out of a different path, depending on whether it remembers its installation path -- if you copy it away and then put it back where it was, it oughta work
[21:16:24] <tdsmith> if you really need this permanently one thing you can do is create a tap that contains an explicitly versioned formula of the form openapi-generator@1.2.3
[21:18:36] <bn_work> how do I create a tap?  also, I assume I do that before I do `brew install --HEAD openapi-generator`?
[21:19:05] <tdsmith> i think that's written up at docs.brew.sh
[21:20:05] <bn_work> oh, it's in the man page, but not --help
[21:22:48] *** Joins: donofrio (~donofrio@c-68-40-123-74.hsd1.mi.comcast.net)
[21:23:59] <bn_work> tdsmith: is a tap basically locally saving a formula at a specific version?
[21:24:35] <tdsmith> you can use it that way -- a tap is a repository of formulas
[21:31:00] <bn_work> tdsmith: ok, I'm reading https://docs.brew.sh/Taps but still confused about how to use it?  can I just run `brew tap openapi-generator@x.y.z`?  or do I have to do `brew tap https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/bd0304d37abdd5d938d5859c28529d27cb1c36d9/Formula/openapi-generator.rb` if I want v4.2.3 for ex?
[21:31:31] <tdsmith> no
[21:31:42] <bn_work> if the latter, does it know that it's v4.2.3?
[21:31:56] <tdsmith> taps are just about the repository -- they don't have any special relationship to individual formulas or versioned formulas
[21:32:54] <tdsmith> so the process is basically 1) create a repository 2) put a new formula in it (i.e. copy over the .rb file and change the name) that captures the package at a particular version, named something like foo@1.2.3.rb -- there's no special support for generating this file, you have to do it by hand
[21:32:58] <tdsmith> 3) install your new thing
[21:33:26] <tdsmith> (this is kind of a lot of work and may not be worth it for your application, depending!)
[21:34:02] <bn_work> by "repository" do you mean a new gh repo?
[21:34:19] <bn_work> under my account?
[21:34:58] <tdsmith> strictly speaking not necessarily but yes they're usually published to github; tdsmith/homebrew-ham is an example
[21:49:59] <bn_work> this sounds unnecessarily complicated, can I not just archive a local copy of the .rb file?  PS:  I've already archived my current version of openapi-generator installation in my main src repo, it seems to only be a .jar and a shell script.  I wonder if I should just brew update --HEAD openapi-generator (formula doesn't seem that complex?)
[22:03:28] <tdsmith> probably, try it
