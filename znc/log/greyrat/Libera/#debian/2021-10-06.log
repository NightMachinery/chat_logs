[00:23:35] <somiaj> zzo38: I would put the main mirror personally. The policy says https is prefered if available.
[00:24:09] <somiaj> For both fields, any URLs given should use a scheme that provides confidentiality (https, for example, rather than http or git) if the VCS repository supports it.
[00:24:31] <somiaj> I think having a more offical up to date mirror is more important than https, but others may disagree
[00:24:59] <somiaj> again #debian-mentors on irc.oftc.net might have better info for what is required for packages in debian (note this is assuming your goal is to add this package to debian)

[07:21:47] <Epakai> Do I just need the linux-image-...-dbg package to get a backtrace in the kernel log? Currently only seeing "BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008" in the log from prior boot, then output stops
[07:25:33] <PMT> No, the kernel is perfectly capable of printing its own stacktrace without the -dbg package.

[07:38:35] <PMT> You could try configuring something like remote syslogging to another machine, see if that captures it better (or, first, just local syslog, if you don't have it enabled - not "just" journalctl) - the "traditional" option would be something like a local serial console with it printing this out, you could try configuring kdump to panic and dump on BUG_ON to get both a dmesg capture and a dump file to look at.

[07:39:48] <PMT> That's slightly surprising to me, though - usually I'd expect it to have captured what followed if it saw the BUG line at all, unless for whatever reason it was so confused it couldn't figure out the backtrace.

[07:46:43] <PMT> Note that kdump may require some manual fiddling after enabling to confirm it reliably kexecs and dumps - so even if it says "ready to dump", you should try echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger and make sure it works properly. (Note that that will trigger a crash to confirm it kdumps, so don't do that unless you're prepared to reboot either way.) (Note also that BUG_ON by default won't trigger kdump, I believe, so

[12:23:36] <ede> i had enough problems in the past to value a smal base system that can run on its own
[12:23:56] <nr0q_radio> You can still mkdir /usr/bin and put stuff in it and add it to your system PATH,
[12:24:37] <nr0q_radio> It just doesn't appear that's the default which for most users would work better for them. I don't see anything saying a person can't create directories and doing stuff with them.
[12:26:46] <ede> it's a link into /usr, no big difference on a daily basis.
[12:27:31] <nr0q_radio> yup and on most systems even if you break them into different partitions, because drives are so massive, they'll be on the same drive so if the drive fails, so does all the partitions on it
[12:27:53] <ede> that said, it's normally of no interest if something is in /bin or /usr/bin. but something could be in /sbin instead, which can be an issue with sudo (at least you can't tab it unless you use the whole path)
[12:28:03] <ede> no
[12:28:16] <ede> i have issues with this drive, but only with a single partition
[12:28:55] <nr0q_radio> I have '/', '/boot', and '/boot/efi' all on the same drive so if dies so does my system until I reinstall it on a new drive, but my '/tmp', '/var' and '/home' are on 2 other drives so they'll be fine
[12:29:07] <ede> also the fs is partition specific, which is something else that could break sooner or later
[12:30:35] <ede> i can only use 2 drives and the 2nd one is for data. both PCs need some proprietary crap to insert HDDs, took me a minute to attach them in the past with the traditional 4 screws, but no...
[12:30:40] <nr0q_radio> I've only ever had 1 fs failure that wasn't related to a drive issue, and too many drive failures

[12:36:50] <ede> if you need their help just don't tell them you're on it
[12:37:01] <Khepra> also what is "base system", there's no such thing in a gnu/linux distro; a gnu/linux distro is a loose collection of third party packages
[12:38:14] <ede> keep out everything X and office and games and internet. but basically the things NOT in /usr
[12:38:23] <nr0q_radio> yup and my prior experience with managing systems is that if something in that part has gone sideways, I end up usually re-installing the "base" system anyways and just remount the parts with copies of the configs and remount the data partitions

[12:54:48] <nr0q_radio> yup and in my broadcast studios that meant VNC server because that's the only way I can access those machines when not physically present
[12:56:00] <Khepra> and firefox needs xorg. so xorg is part of base too. and a WM at least. I tried running firefox directly under xorg, wouldn't work as it doesn't render its own windows, requires a WM. so that's xorg + a WM at least, or a wayland compositing WM and no xorg.

[22:41:35] <colemickens> I just want to cry, is there seriously no un-encumbered impl of unrar? ffs
[22:43:05] <PMT> I mean, there is, it's just not solving your problem, it sounds like.
[22:44:28] <PMT> You could try p7zip's rar implementation, but I think that's probably based on the same library.

[22:57:59] <dob1> it's an alias
