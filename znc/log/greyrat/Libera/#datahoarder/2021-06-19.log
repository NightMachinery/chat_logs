[19:43:20] <NiLon> there's 3 possibilities: 1. samba server refuses the permissions 2. your client refuses the remote permissions 3. your client refuses the local permissions (of the filesystem)
[19:43:41] <NiLon> if unsure best option is maybe not do any checks on the client

[21:05:58] <superkuh> I believe so.
[21:06:07] <Allie> And what makes it "not good"? 
[21:06:20] <superkuh> Sorry, not as good. Not much headroom versus the new variants.
[21:06:54] <superkuh> Plus, it's DNA carried so involves splicing and mis-splices can happen. Whereas with mRNA vaccines you're already passed that and go directly to protein expression... and don't involve a live virus of any kind.
[21:08:23] <superkuh> To be even more clear: all of the adenovirus vector ones I know of are far less efficient in preventing infection, symptoms, and to a lesser extent, serious disease than the two well known mRNA vaccines.
[21:08:34] <Allie> superkuh: can you point me to any literature which says that's a serious concern? 
[21:08:54] <superkuh> Literature which says being less effective is a serious concern? Are you being serious?
[21:10:05] <Allie> Literature that says DNA mis-splices are a serious concern
[21:10:09] <superkuh> Ah, one sec.
[21:10:23] <superkuh> It's one of theories for why the adenovirus ones have some problems in some very few people.
