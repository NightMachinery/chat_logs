[04:53:49] <ljetibo> How come when I look at `Thumbnails.objects.select_related("wcs__metadata").query` I see something like `SELECT thumbnails.columns, wcs.columns, metadata.columns from thumbnails inner join wcs inner join metadata` BUT I can't select `...values("metadata.date")` for example?
[04:54:30] <ljetibo> the only extra values I can select are the columns of thumbnails table, and the id column of the wcs table
[04:54:58] <ljetibo> I can make a short example I guess if this is too confusing, I just thought someone might want to take a guess?
[04:55:57] <FunkyBob> don't you mean values("wcs__metadata__date")?  which wouldn't require the select_related anyway

[04:59:50] <ljetibo> FunkyBob: that works, but now I'm confused as to why double underscores work there as I tried that previously having a double then a single. It was my understanding that double underscore is like a "look one table up", and a single for a column name of that table. I am obviously confusing pots and pans here - when does it go one udnerscore and when does it go two?

[05:01:50] <FunkyBob> it's never one underscore
[05:01:58] <ljetibo> right, but date is a column in metadata, so why isn't it `wcs__metadata_date`?
[05:02:04] <ljetibo> that's what I was trying before
[05:02:04] *** Joins: cmbengue (~Thunderbi@207.191.249.160)
[05:02:47] <FunkyBob> because you're traversing the fields wcs -> metadata -> date
[05:06:13] <ljetibo> Ok, I guess I wasn't thinking of jumping tables (wcs-->metadata) as traversing "fields" (although I guess after joining on id cols it would be like traversing field I guess). In any case, thanks

[05:14:38] <levi_> Hey all, looking for some suggestions on what might be the most straightforward, but robust centralized logging to set up for our services. Our applications are mainly running Django on Lambda. I'm thinking the ELK stack may make sense, but not sure if there are simpler options or others that may be a bit easier to implement given that we are on AWS. The goal is just to have observability into our systems and be able to search through
[05:14:38] <levi_> our logs in one place. Any ideas?

[14:00:08] <iwkse> FunkyBob: it's basic model.save() with foreign key like:
[14:00:38] <iwkse> Account = models.ForeignKey(GlsAccount, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)
[14:01:33] <FunkyBob> it's unusual to give a field a capitalised name

[14:11:07] <iwkse> I think I found out the issue
[14:11:13] <FunkyBob> ok, so wherre in the model is accountref defined?
[14:15:09] <iwkse> FunkyBob: it's solved, it was an issue on the db
[14:15:19] <iwkse> basically because we had problems with migrations
[14:15:36] <iwkse> so that field on the db is called accountref, but not on the model
[14:16:11] <FunkyBob> you can tell the model that's the db field's name...
[14:16:17] <iwkse> issue with migrations, just when modifying models the change wont' be reflected
[14:16:22] <iwkse> ah
[14:16:30] <iwkse> without changing the db field?

[23:14:54] <T-101> having a strange thing happen intermittently and I am completely unable to reproduce it locally. this is an oauth thing. I save a state to request.session and then it redirects to the oauth site. is it possible that when django is running on gunicorn with multiple workers, that when the redirect comes back to django, it comes back to a different worker and the state is nowhere to be found in request.session?

[23:18:58] <puff> Good afternoon.  I need to do a fairly simple little web app, basically a glorified to do list, two or three tables (plus the user table for logins, although ultimately I'd like to integrate with a third party site's oauth and share their login).
[23:19:50] <puff> Normally I'd just dust off the php but I figure this might be a good chance to learn python web development.  I'm going to host this on dreamhost, because I already have an account and several sites there, and dreamhost seems to have django support via Passenger.
[23:20:44] <puff> The installation looks straightforward, but of course dreamhost's knowledge base has nothing on actually creating stuff in django.  Can you folks point me at a godo tutorial for somebody with a ton of experience with web stuff but not python web stuff?
[23:21:20] <puff> I started with Perl and CGI back in the late 90s, a couple decades of java, the odd PHP (you just can't help getting some on you, in this field)...
[23:21:54] <puff> Come to think of it, technicall I started with perl and CGI in 1994.
[23:22:05] <puff> I remember when they added the background tag :-).
