[11:06:12] <Jong> Is the word "model" used equivocally in machine learning? I read sentences like "Machine learning is when machines learn from data to build a model of that data that can then be used to make predictions of new data."  But I've also read sentences like "ONNX is an open format built to represent machine learning models." Here "model" seems to mean simply the "architecture" of a neural network, like how many nodes, how are they
[11:06:12] <Jong>  connected. Weight values are typically excluded from the meaning of architecture.  Does "model" mean architecture + values placed in the value holder locations?  Even if so, that's not modeling the data.  Instead that's modeling rules about the data, like rules determining how to classify the data or a probability of something associated with the data

[11:14:34] <Jong> In one sene, "model" is about the neural network and how it looks if you were to draw it out.  In another sense, "model" is about data. Agree or disagree?

[11:54:35] <Jong> If the word "model" is equivocal, why not find two separate words instead?

[13:49:29] <Crowley99> I've always thought of Model as being both.  Model Topology/Structure would refer to any specific structures, and Model Coefficients/Weights, would refer to the coeffients/weights of the trained model.
