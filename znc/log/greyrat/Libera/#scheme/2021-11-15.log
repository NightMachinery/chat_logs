[12:16:22] <amazigh> that is inherited from scheme-to-c by akeep on github, I do not use it in the current code base.

[19:37:19] <jcowan> dpk: Not as far as enyone knows.  Syntax-case, ER, and IR can all be implemented on the same substrate modulo a few issues, but none can be implemented on top of any other.
[19:38:12] <dpk> IR can be implemented on top of ER. there's a Chibi pull request for it, but i think foof refused to merge it because he didn't want to encourage people to use IR due to the quadratic expansion time
[19:38:59] <gwatt> I still maintain you can implement renaming on top of syntax-case. (Maybe not in a desirable manner, but it does work)
[19:41:15] <dpk> i think gwatt is right
[19:41:18] <sham1> Well the only one that you can seem to implement on-top of one thing is syntax-rules ontop of syntax-case (makes sense, they mostly use the same things) and plain traditional lisp transformers ontop of syntax-case. There's even stuff about it on the r6rs manual for both cases
[19:41:53] <gwatt> https://github.com/gwatt/macros
[19:45:10] *** Joins: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23)
[19:45:17] <gwatt> Oh right, there's the caveat that you could call {er,ir}-macro-transformer at a different location than define-syntax, and that would be wrong in what I did.
[19:47:54] <dpk> i don't think that's a terrible problem
[19:50:40] <dpk> i think if gwatt's implementation (or implementation strategy) is workable, i would be okay with having both systems in R7RS Large. still not really happy about it, as it would to me be the quintessential example of how the current voting process is leading to a tendency to just include everything that gets proposed, regardless of how well the resulting language fits together as a whole
[19:51:19] <dpk> but if implementers only actually need to do the under-the-hood work for one and can get the other one for free in an interoperable implementation … well, fine
[19:55:20] <sham1> Seems like the voting could very well lead r7rs-large to be large indeed
[19:55:59] <gwatt> r7rs-supersize-me

[20:02:02] <dpk> and if gwatt's implementation isn't feasible for whatever reason, i really seriously think we should chosen (and presented the choice as) one vs the other, rather than even allowing the possibility of both
[20:02:02] <gwatt> for a while r8rs.org redirected to sbcl
[20:03:04] <amazigh> also related https://i.redd.it/pikrctct8mq41.jpg
[20:03:15] <amazigh> r8rs.org redirect to speechcode.org iirc
[20:03:31] <gwatt> it does now
[20:03:31] <dpk> R7RS is, afaik, supposed to be less of a burden for implementers than R6RS was. if we mandate two low-level macro systems which are currently only supported in combination by one implementation, which require changes to the low-level macro expansion, we're putting more requirements on implementers than R6RS did

[20:03:53] <sham1> Maybe Greenspun's 10th rule was correct all along
[20:04:00] <amazigh> sham1: how so?
[20:04:23] <amazigh> I mean I do not understand how it relates to the above convo?
[20:04:47] <sham1> dpk: it could always be made optional feature
[20:04:49] <dpk> actually, no, sorry: two implementations. Chibi and Unsyntax both support both systems, but Chibi's syntax-case implementation is deficient
[20:04:54] <sham1> But officially specified

[20:55:10] <dpk> mathematically, yes (72% + 36% > 100%)
[20:55:25] <dpk> aaaaaaaugh, whoever just voted requested implicit renaming 😩
[20:55:29] <dpk> why do i even bother

[20:59:46] <Zipheir> ty
[21:00:21] <dpk> i have no idea what 'Only as a SRFI' is supposed to mean. 'No', i guess (i'm understanding that the person thinks these things should be imported through (srfi xyz) rather than (scheme some-name)?) but to me it's just an indication of someone who has not understood what the voting is about
[21:01:39] <Zipheir> The same vote also appears for ER.
[21:05:33] <Zipheir> Apparently someone voted twice!
[21:06:16] <Zipheir> Several pseudonyms, and one person included their title.  Very amusing.
[21:07:41] <dpk> however, the question of how many people voted for both is also an interesting one
[21:08:36] <dpk> even if ER reaches a technical majority of non-abstentions, i would be interested to see that data because i suspect it would bear me out that, while some people want one system or the other, the appetite for including both is limited
[21:08:59] <dpk> (low likely even among those who didn't bother reading my or M N-W's arguments against including both)
[21:23:16] <amazigh> titles ftw!
[21:23:49] <amazigh> lot of people seems to agree with the work done in SRFI
[21:24:02] <amazigh> I mean most SRFIs are at this time voted yes
[21:24:17] <amazigh> Zipheir: what do you think of titles?
[21:24:55] <Zipheir> amazigh: I meant titles like "Dr.", which I think are eminently medieval and silly.
[21:25:55] <amazigh> You might have the skills of a PhD but not the title?
[21:26:28] <sham1> Presenting one's self as a sum of one's titles seems weird
[21:26:58] <amazigh> So far, in this world, it seems being explicit about your rank is better; I am not sure fighting oligarchy (in this case academic / knowledge hiearachy) seems worthless
[21:27:04] <Zipheir> Or vice-versa.  Either way, it's some kind of rank, and I don't believe rank has any valid role in intellectual work.
[21:27:48] <amazigh> that is what an outsider would say :)
[21:28:01] <amazigh> (sorry, I slightly do the devil advocate)
[21:28:04] <Zipheir> Or maybe an insider who has dealt with the pain of academic hierarchy.
[21:28:34] <amazigh> that exactly the reason, my plan is to continue my PhD on wikiversity.
[21:28:40] <Zipheir> Indeed.
[21:28:47] <amazigh> but I might be forced to do a PhD to eat.
[21:29:43] <Zipheir> When I read about e.g. abuse of doctoral students by those who "outrank them", I'm inclined to believe it's not just a harmless medievalism.  But, enough.
[21:30:22] <amazigh> sorry!
[21:31:06] <Zipheir> No, I'm sorry, I started the tangent.
[21:31:13] *** Quits: badkins (~badkins@136.56.92.199) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:31:43] <Zipheir> Wow, the vote on `receive` is strongly pro at this point.
[21:32:41] <sham1> Being able to deal with multiple values is good
[21:32:54] <dpk> but we already have let-values
[21:33:04] <dpk> i don't really understand why we need receive as well
[21:33:24] <Zipheir> Exactly my thought.
[21:33:26] <dpk> the difference is two pairs of parentheses in the first clause
[21:33:29] <sham1> Yes, and call-with-values
[21:33:38] <dpk> but meh. it's a simple macro
[21:33:41] <Zipheir> receive is very specific.
[21:33:51] <dpk> i'm not going to get uppity about it
[21:33:57] <Zipheir> Indeed, who cares.
[21:34:18] <sham1> It's a simple macrk
[21:34:21] <sham1> Macro
[21:34:27] <Zipheir> But I believe it would be an inelegant addition, so I voted against it.
[21:35:00] <amazigh> I think compose is more useful than receive
[21:35:12] <sham1> What did you think of the infix binary operator one
[21:35:13] <amazigh> or the new threading macros
[21:35:37] <sham1> You'd need to teach the threading macro to understand multiple values first
[21:36:00] <amazigh> re compose, see https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-197/
[21:36:42] <amazigh> guile's compose does not support multiple values.
[21:37:01] <Zipheir> sham1: SRFI 197 `chain` is supposed to support multiple values transparently.
[21:37:06] <amazigh> I am not sure what infix binary operator is.
[21:37:55] <dpk> if we get identifier-syntax we can have SRFI 210 compose-left and compose-right with no runtime overhead
[21:37:59] <sham1> Zipheir: that it seems. Good
[21:40:13] <Zipheir> Yes, also SRFI 210, which is lighter weight.
[21:40:27] <dpk> (unless you happen to have a crap Scheme where call-with-values itself causes runtime overhead)
[21:40:44] <sham1> amazigh: it'd be the ability to write (is a <= b) as opposed to (<= a b). There's an SRFI and it's part of this
[21:40:58] <dpk> (or you treat the compose functions themselves as higher-order and pass them around)
[21:43:20] <gwatt> It seems weird that identifier-syntax isn't included in the syntax-case option it's an easy syntax-case macro to write
[21:44:50] <dpk> ι τηινκ. αργη. that's better. i think the intention is to ask whether we'll support expansion of identifiers outside of operand position
[21:45:17] <gwatt> jcowan: does the syntax-case option in the ballot also imply datum->syntax, syntax->datum, generate-temporaries?
[21:45:19] <amazigh> dpk: a crap scheme like dragon peek kryptonit scheme? :)
[21:45:38] <jcowan> gwatt: Yes, the whole R6RS library
[21:45:56] <sham1> Imagine having syntax-case without datum->syntax and syntax->datum. That'd be rather odd
[21:46:16] <amazigh> identifier properties seems like good addition (at least, I think I need them for my generics library)
[21:46:22] <jcowan> The reason id-syntax is a separate question is that you miight want it without syntax-case.
[21:46:57] <gwatt> that's fair.
[21:47:33] <dpk> so if syntax-case is picked, it will support identifier syntax (no hyphen) even if identifier-syntax (with hyphens) is rejected?
[21:48:14] <dpk> -s
[21:48:49] <sham1> Hyphens work since it's one or more
[21:49:24] <dpk> [linguist consternation noises]
[21:49:30] <gwatt> Anyone who wants to use identifier-syntax would have to make it, but assuming syntax-case is R6RS compatible it's pretty simple to write your own
