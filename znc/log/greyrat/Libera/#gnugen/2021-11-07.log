[16:29:52] <Timothe[m]> Various IT stuff/books I'm getting rid of: https://paste.gnugen.ch/paste/RoU3
[16:29:53] <Timothe[m]> It's all free or pay whatever you want. I don't really care, as long as everything goes away and is hopefully  at least somewhat useful to someone :-)
[18:45:24] <artectrex[m]> Is that a drawing tablet?
[18:45:43] <artectrex[m]> What do you want for the ssd?
[18:57:30] <Timothe[m]> It's a remarkable 1 - same one that Roos use.
[19:01:15] <Timothe[m]> As for the SSD, whatever you want - nothing, can be a cake, a coffee, CHF.- 10. I don't really know the state of the SSD, but last time I checked it worked.
[19:09:33] <Notkea> I'd be interested in the Remarkable, but I live far away now :c
[19:10:33] <Notkea> >  I don't really know the state of the SSD
[19:10:33] <Notkea> it's solid. HAHAHAHAHA.

[20:35:59] <nu[m]> owo id like to have the bpi r1
[20:36:16] <nu[m]> its such a brokenly designed mobo
[20:37:46] <nu[m]> <Notkea> "I'd be interested in the..." <- i can help to post it 4 if u want. wanted to try it for some time now
[20:37:54] <nu[m]> * it 4 u if u
[20:39:25] <Notkea> to try posting things or trying the device?
[20:39:34] <nu[m]> posting!
[20:40:13] <Notkea> oh, why so?
[20:40:53] <nu[m]> because the swiss post seems very advanced
[20:41:27] <Notkea> their "customs" part is indeed very advanced, haha
[20:41:42] <Notkea> but yes, I would appreciate that !
[20:46:14] <Orbstheorem> <Timothe[m]> "It's a remarkable 1 - same one..." <- Can I have the rm1? 
[20:51:33] <Notkea> hmm, that's problematic
[21:11:46] <Timothe[m]> <nu[m]> "owo id like to have the bpi r1" <- You can come to pick it up, you know where I live.
[21:11:54] <Timothe[m]> As for the tablet, we can take this off-channel.
[21:26:17] <nu[m]> <Orbstheorem> "Can I have the rm1?..." <- u already have one :P
[22:46:44] <Orbstheorem> > <@nu:synapse.yokai.cafe> > <@roosemberth:orbstheorem.ch> Can I have the rm1?
[22:46:45] <Orbstheorem> > 
[22:46:45] <Orbstheorem> > u already have one :P
[22:46:45] <Orbstheorem> Yes, I wanted to have a backup to play with mine with less fear.
