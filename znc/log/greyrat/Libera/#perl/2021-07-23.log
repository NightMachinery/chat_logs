[02:18:52] <Grinnz> found a new lolmysql entry
[02:19:02] <Kobaz> lollersqls
[02:19:06] <Kobaz> people still use mysql?
[02:19:22] <Grinnz> tragically
[02:20:07] <nirnam> learn mysql so that I can say I know data base
[02:21:32] <Grinnz> perlbot: lolmysql -1
[02:21:36] <perlbot> Grinnz: - The DATE_FORMAT function takes a format that is just similar enough to strftime to be confusing. For example, %M means the full name of the month rather than its usual meaning of minutes.
[02:21:49] <Grinnz> hm, either that's cached or off-by-one
[02:22:13] <Grinnz> perlbot: lolmysql 0
[02:22:16] <perlbot> Grinnz: - To change any part of a column's definition, you have to redefine the column entirely. Changing the column type, whether it's nullable, auto_increment, or default requires specifying all of those things again.
[02:22:28] <Grinnz> ... sure, 0 is the last one, that makes sense
[02:22:59] <LeoNerd> maybe items are unshift'ed? :)
[02:23:16] <Grinnz> 1 is the first one, i know that part works :P
[02:24:56] <pragma-> I like how it replaces broken functions with "real" replacements. mysql_real_escape_string
[02:24:56] <Grinnz> and if you're wondering, that one occurred to me because i accidentally un-auto_incremented a primary key
[02:25:49] <LeoNerd> Will the real MySQL please stand up
[02:26:06] <Grinnz> and for reasons i'm hesitant to explore, on one server that caused it to fail because the primary key didn't have a default, and on another it inserted 0 even though we enable strict mode
[02:26:23] <thunder> you mean mariadb?

[02:30:55] <perlbot> Grinnz: - Temporary tables (which are tables designed to be specific to ONE CONNECTION) get replicated to slave databases if you are using statement- or mixed-format replication, wasting everyone's time and CPU. The documented solution is to designate a prefix for your temporary tables and configure the replication to ignore tables with that prefix.
[02:30:56] <Grinnz> what did i screw up
[02:30:59] <Grinnz> oh there it goes
[02:31:58] <pragma-> curious macro syntax

[10:42:23] <horsepatat> any ideas on how to make HTTP::Tiny to bail out when it visited an audio streaming service?
[10:42:51] <horsepatat> it's returning seemingly unlimited binary output and HTTP::Tiny just keeps on reading forever, since no read timeout or end of it arrives.
[10:43:56] <horsepatat> I guess I can use SIG ALARM, if $http->get() didnt return in 5 seconds, time to wrap it up.
[10:44:32] <horsepatat> but then I wont get the request headers at all and will have to mark link as garbage while it's not at all
[10:45:29] <horsepatat> quick fix is max_size => 1mb, then I will just need to wait for 1 mega of stream
[10:45:47] <Adura> Wouldn't the Content-Type header suffice?
[10:46:16] <horsepatat> how can I evaluate it before it starts infinitly reading data stream?
[10:46:27] *** Quits: Bossi (~quassel@p4fc2272c.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[10:46:36] <Adura> I don't know the module well enough, hah.
[10:46:51] <Adura> Though, a HEAD request comes to mind.
[10:47:11] <horsepatat> I could do that with data_callbackk, it provides headers and chunks of data little by little
[10:48:14] <horsepatat> HEAD would do, but I am parsing titles and meta descriptions, so GET is still needed afterwards.
[10:48:56] <horsepatat> send HEAD, parse headers, figure its HTML and only then send GET?
[10:49:27] <Adura> If it saves bandwidth... sure?!

[17:07:16] <ehuelsmann[m]> then how do you know the problem is with the regex? Did you try running the program without the regex processing?
[17:07:57] <depesz> i ran devel::nytprof, first, and then made small self-contained case, which read the input from file, and runs the regexp

[17:12:22] <Altreus> it may be more efficient to perform these replacements separately
[17:12:34] <ehuelsmann[m]> not by checking if the line has +$

[17:13:10] <depesz> \r i don't really care about.
[17:13:20] <ehuelsmann[m]> maybe it's quicker to check for +\r?\n and only run the regex when that matches.
[17:13:23] <Botje-> depesz: I tried various file patterns and perl rips through it instantly.
[17:13:34] <Altreus> so you could collapse it to \s*\+$
[17:13:34] <depesz> Botje-: give me a moment.
[17:13:55] <ehuelsmann[m]> I'm also surprised this is a problem, to be honest.

[17:14:10] <Botje-> sure
[17:17:33] <depesz> Botje-: we can move the conversation back here.
[17:20:23] <Botje-> depesz: running with -Mre=debug shows it's stuck backtracking
[17:21:02] <depesz> yeah, but how to make it better?
[17:21:38] <shlomif> depesz: i think i wrote a routine in C for that too
[17:24:04] <Botje-> depesz: your first line is 200KB of whitespaces and perl is killing itself backtracking over that.
[17:24:25] <Botje-> so if this format is predictable, skipping the first line is the easiest solution.
[17:24:47] <depesz> no. this is extreme case.
[17:24:47] <alh> Maybe: s/\s*+\+\r?$/\n/g;
[17:24:51] <alh> Which prevents backtracking more or less

[21:05:59] <StayHungry> I'm comparing the shortest ways of swapping first and last items of string such as 23-07-2021 into 2021-07-23 between languages
[21:06:07] *** Joins: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel)

[21:07:56] <StayHungry> good lord, LeoNerd, you grasped the issue at lightning speed without further questions, you're angel of Perl :D
[21:08:01] <LeoNerd> "swapping first and last" is a big vague when you only give one three-part example. Do you want to reverse the entire lot? What if there's 2 parts.. or more than 3 parts?
[21:08:02] <mjgardner> Don’t even need that m
[21:08:11] <LeoNerd> *bit vague
[21:09:01] <StayHungry> powershell -> '23-07-2021'.split('-')[2..0] -join '-'
[21:09:19] <StayHungry> python -> print('-'.join(reversed('23-07-2021'.split('-'))))
[21:09:26] <ether> you can also do it with s/^(\d+)-(\d+)-(\d+)$/$3-$2-$1/r  but that's longer

[21:09:50] <StayHungry> let's see what Perl is about to offer

[21:11:25] <pragma-> perl keeps confounding my expectations
[21:11:30] <LeoNerd> lexicals are inherently simpler
[21:11:53] <LeoNerd> They basically push a lot of the complicated bits over to compiletime, making runtime faster
[21:12:19] <pragma-> no, it does seem to be the order of the subs.
[21:12:32] <pragma-> i renamed them for sure this time and whichever sub runs first is slightly faster
[21:12:36] <pragma-> they're both identical otehrwise
[21:12:47] <Grinnz> benchmark noise probably
[21:12:51] <pragma-> the difference is so tiny you can't even really tell
[21:13:05] <mjgardner> shlomif: Already married, so now I just need the other two.
[21:13:18] <pragma-> i'll use my $i
[21:13:29] <LeoNerd> lexicals are cleaner and safer, too
[21:13:52] <Grinnz> yes, performance is a shitty reason to use $_ in general
[21:14:26] <pragma-> er, i mean whichever runs second.

[21:15:06] <StayHungry> LeoNerd: perl -e 'print(join "-", (split m/-/, "2021-07-23")[2,1,0])' works as expected, sir
[21:15:14] <StayHungry> thank you
[21:15:33] <StayHungry> that m/-/ is not obvious, but oh well

[21:15:49] <Grinnz> StayHungry: perldoc -f split
[21:16:04] <LeoNerd> The `m` is entirely optional, you can just write  split /-/, ...
[21:16:09] <Grinnz> generally written with out the m in split's case
[21:16:11] <LeoNerd> I just like to be explicit with the `m`
[21:16:13] <StayHungry> chaning -e to -E throws error 'Can't locate feature.pm in @INC '
[21:16:19] <LeoNerd> Uhh
[21:16:22] <LeoNerd> Then your perl is broken
[21:16:31] <StayHungry> -e works fine :)
[21:16:41] <Grinnz> -le would also add a newline
[21:16:54] <StayHungry> indeed!
[21:16:54] <Grinnz> er, maybe i made that up
[21:17:33] <Grinnz> no, works for any print
[21:17:42] <StayHungry> why /-/ and not '-' ?
[21:17:51] <Grinnz> because split's first argument is a regex not a string
[21:17:55] <shlomif> mjgardner: a little money can buy you a lot of love/happiness/education, so no need to be a miser
[21:17:56] <Grinnz> that's why i mentioned its docs
[21:18:00] <LeoNerd> They're equivalent in this case. split will cope
[21:18:13] <Grinnz> it will, but you shouldn't write it as a string because that will confuse people into thinking it is
[21:18:13] <LeoNerd> Though since generally split's first argument is a regexp, I just always write it that way anyway
[21:18:25] <Grinnz> there have been bugs in Mojolicious because of this
[21:18:39] <StayHungry> hooray, perl -le 'print(join "-", (split "-", "2021-07-23")[2,1,0])' works :)
[21:18:44] <Grinnz> don't do that
[21:19:06] <Grinnz> split /-/ is correct
[21:19:20] * StayHungry obeys
[21:19:45] <Grinnz> there is only one case where you should call split with a string, and it's the single-space special case which the docs go over
