[01:41:30] <lxsymington[m]> Hi, what’s the best place for finding which lua metamethods are supported within neovim? The lua 5.1 manual appears to list __len and __ call as available but maybe I am misreading it or have got the wrong version?
[01:42:10] <bfredl> yes, 5.1 manual is the correct reference
[01:42:57] <bfredl> on most systems we build with luajit, but it is not guaranteed (but plugins can of c decide to only support nvim with luajit)
[01:45:18] <lxsymington[m]> So is luajit a subset of 5.1 and not necessarily include those metamethods, I am not sure I quite follow?
[01:45:47] <bfredl> superset
[01:46:06] <bfredl> mostly, it supports the same metamethods, but you can even yield from inside metamethod
[01:47:32] <lordmzte> some plugin is setting the file types for files without extension to shell, does anyone know what plugin that might be and how would i find out?
[01:48:00] <bfredl> maybe plugin is nvim core

[15:51:45] <clason[m]> I'm not talking about luamake, I'm talking about lua-language-server
[15:55:55] <sudoforge[m]> perhaps i misunderstood; your earlier output is from the `./compile/install.sh` step within `luamake`, correct?
[15:56:07] <clason[m]> no
[15:56:44] <sudoforge[m]> oh, i missed the bottom few lines on my phone
[15:56:52] <clason[m]> (well, the first part is, which completes successfully. it should build lua-language-server next, but that step seems to be just skipped)
[15:57:07] <sudoforge[m]> i didn't notice that you had chained them together, my bad
[15:57:32] <clason[m]> I did exactly what is stated in the build instructions.

[15:58:37] <sudoforge[m]> that's what i missed while reading it on my phone
[15:58:50] <sunjonSenghanBri> i am connecting via my smartwatch - perhaps I can be of assistance?
[15:59:00] <clason[m]> Well, I assumed that you were familiar with building lua-language-server, since you jumped into the conversation.
[16:00:04] <sudoforge[m]> familiar, yes, but not from the development side of things with this particular project. in any case, i'm fully understanding your issue now, and yes, i can recreate that on x64 linux
[16:00:36] <sudoforge[m]> as in: i do not get a lua-language-server binary either.

[16:02:20] <sudoforge[m]> yep :)
[16:02:46] <sudoforge[m]> i'll bisect the submodules, because why not
[16:03:39] <clason[m]> note that  `bee.lua` is pulled in twice: once by lua-language-server, and once by luamake
[16:04:52] <clason[m]> in the past, issues were usually with `bee.lua`
[16:08:34] <synthmeat> is efm supposed to be attached to every buffer, regardless of the filetype?

[16:16:34] <clason[m]> yeah, makes sense.
[16:19:55] <clason[m]> So you bisected it to that commit?
[16:20:43] <sudoforge[m]> yep
[16:20:55] <clason[m]> Thank you, that is helpful. I'll open an issue then.
[16:21:07] <sudoforge[m]> that commit is 100% the issue. no idea what it's doing, of course, but i can guarantee that `bee.lua` isn't the problem this time around

[16:38:12] <sudoforge[m]> that action (`setup-luamake`) probably isn't following `HEAD`
[16:38:40] <clason[m]> yeah, probably
[16:40:05] <sudoforge[m]> people call me crazy for vendoring every single one of my deps, but it helps to avoid issues like this entirely
[16:42:33] <sudoforge[m]> i use `copybara` to sync in/out of my monorepo, tracking `HEAD` of everything -- but bad commits don't get in, because each change is tested in isolation and not dependent on some external tool (e.g. that action)
[16:42:57] <clason[m]> not sure; the issue here is not the vendored vs. submodule but the insufficient testing when updating
[16:43:01] *** Joins: realguy_ (~realguy@user/realguy)

[19:33:12] <telemachus[m]> For whatever it's worth, I gave up building neovim HEAD via `brew` because it failed relatively often. I find it easier to just use a simple script to set the install directory and let neovim's makefile handle all the other dependencies. (I think that the only requirement on a mac outside of normal build tools is cmake and maybe ninja.)
[19:34:48] <clason[m]> you need `ninja libtool automake cmake pkg-config gettext curl`
[19:35:15] <clason[m]> everything else gets pulled in and built with a simple `make install` from the cloned repo
[19:35:21] <telemachus[m]> Hah, thanks. I no doubt always have those given just other builds.
[19:35:43] <telemachus[m]> But I should add those to the script's checks. Thanks.

[22:24:58] <mhinz[m]> I guess you simply didn't set your terminal editor to use a nerd font, which contains the correct characters.

[22:40:33] <sashanas> I'm trying to use termtoggle to press f5 and run the current file. Already got a function working to do that, but, since termtoggle is lazy loaded by packer, the function, which is inside termtoggle's config file, isn't available, only after I manually open a terminal with the specified key `keys = <C-\>` from packer config. I tried adding <F5> to that list as well so it would load it as well but it didn't work. Anyoone has any idea?

[22:45:42] <sunjonSenghanBri> did you run 😛ackerCompile? If so, what's the output of `:map <f5>`?
[22:46:07] <sashanas> yep, ran PackerCompile after changing it every time, testing other options as well
[22:47:34] <sashanas> n  <F5>        * <Lua function 3> Last set from Lua
[22:47:55] <sashanas> but it gives me an error because the function isn't set yet

[22:50:07] <sunjonSenghanBri> afaik, a properly configured Packer `keys` parameter, should result in a mapping to `<cmd>lua require("packer.load")({'someplugin.vim'....`
[22:53:06] <sashanas> i'm using `keys = {'<C-\\>'},` which i took it from someone else's dotfiles, i tried removing it and the terminal from toggleterm wouldn't open anymore
[22:55:02] <sunjonSenghanBri> remove all lazy loading shennigans and focus on getting it working

[23:05:08] <sashanas> i left it with just a config file `use { termtoggle, config = blabla }` so the other options don't make it lazy load, but that makes the plugin never load instead
[23:06:48] <sunjonSenghanBri> where are you running `require("toggleterm").setup{}` ?
[23:09:53] <sashanas> in a separate file, config-toggleterm.lua
[23:10:17] <sashanas> and in packer, use { 'akinsho/toggleterm.nvim', config = "require('config-toggleterm')" }
[23:12:58] <sunjonSenghanBri> and if you wrap your `config = "require(..."` in `config = function() require('foobar') end` - does that work?

[23:16:16] <sashanas> not really, same thing, after packer compile and restarting neovim - tried checking :scriptnames, toggleterm only showed up after manually doing :lua require('toggleterm')
[23:17:13] <sunjonSenghanBri> try rm'ing your packer cache file, make sure that it's not retaining your lazy load stuff for some reason

[23:39:07] <sashanas> i deleted packer/opt/toggleterm.nvim and let packer install it again, but it puts the plugin into /opt/ again, not /start/
[23:39:20] <sashanas> is this the packer cache or is it somewhere else?
[23:40:35] <sunjonSenghanBri> it's set in a `compile_path` variable in your `packer_opts` config
