[05:20:16] <brucekomike> yes, but you can let your server "trust" your cert on localhost by add your cert to the trusted-cert-list
[05:21:32] <brucekomike> just because your server cannot get ca chain form localhost

[05:33:08] <User9204901> hmm - apologies i dont see to follow that stackoverflow. i am not super familiar with anything referenced in that article given i’m coming from unraid docker where i just installed lounge from the community app store. Do i need to do something on unraid first then edit my config file?
[05:33:30] <User9204901> *cant seem to. follow that stackoverflow page
[05:35:54] <brucekomike> it is about nodejs, not thelounge. Try to find your cert file the make nodejs trust it.
[05:36:19] <brucekomike> i mean "then"
[05:37:25] <brucekomike> try to execute "node" on your server
[05:37:59] <brucekomike> see whether you can configure nodejs
[05:38:49] <brucekomike> oh I forgot to tell you to check the version
[05:39:02] <brucekomike> $ node -v
[05:40:14] <User9204901> v14.13.0
[05:40:19] <User9204901> is what unraid webterminal shows
[05:40:51] <brucekomike> have you find your cert file?
[05:40:55] <User9204901> sorry for dumb question, but what is node.js relationship with the lounge? is the lounge running based off of “node.js”
[05:43:13] <User9204901> hmm im not sure on “my own cert file”. I do have nginx proxy manager installed as its own container, and many years ago i setup various SSL certificates for my DuckDNS configuration. is that relevant to this process (as in, can NGINX Proxy Manager help me with being able to securely connect to IRC servers?)
[05:43:24] <brucekomike> thelougne require nodejs...
[05:44:37] <brucekomike> and you should find the cert file's path in the IRCd config
[05:45:18] <brucekomike> for unrealircd ~/unrealircd/conf/unrealircd.conf
[05:46:27] <User9204901> https://imgur.com/a/anWzOPw is this at all relevant to what we’re trying to accomplish?

[06:06:05] <User9204901> thank you so much for you help, i appreciate you putting up with my stupidity. now are we looking for the IRCd file you were mentioning?
[06:06:56] <brucekomike> you just not have a IRCd running on your server....
[06:08:02] <brucekomike> I have unrealIRCd installed on my server, and connect it through localhost. this make the cert cannot be trusted
[06:09:34] <brucekomike> and it need to be trusted manuaully.
[06:10:11] <brucekomike> I was talking wrong things to you...
[06:10:53] <User9204901> i see. so starting from step 2. I can connect to irc.libera.chat:6697 securely on TheLounge client which i'm currently using. when i try to the same thing for another server, [irc server]:7000 (their instructions provide 7000 for secure and 6667 for insecure), it does not work. I  get the following error - "Connection closed unexpectedly: Error:
[06:10:53] <User9204901> certificate has expired"
[06:12:18] <User9204901> i can connect securely to that same [irc server]:7000 using mibbit web client, so it must be something i have configured wrong on my own TheLounge docker app. trying to figure out what i need to do
[06:13:01] <brucekomike> one way is to trust the cert manually...
[06:14:06] <brucekomike> and another way is to get the ca chain
[06:14:27] <User9204901> which of those two would you recommend?
[06:16:33] <brucekomike> you need to try connecting one more other IRC server to find whether the porblem is common to you thelounge.
[06:16:54] <User9204901> okay let me try another server

[11:22:53] <domicron> Is there a way to specify an alternate to ~/.thelounge ?
[11:23:13] <domicron> Like for example, if I want to run two instances of the lounge under the same uid?

[12:30:52] <domicron> ok I have another dumbo question... public set to true or false is nice, but is it possible to enable anonymous user registration, with the server list locked? So like, a user can hit the URL, setup an account which always retains their connection and can be used across multiple devices concurrently, but does not permit them to connect to any
[12:30:52] <domicron> unlisted irc networks?

[12:38:40] <domicron> I suppose LDAP could work
[12:38:49] <fnutt> domicron: I am pretty sure it would be, if done correctly. There's been two people trying to do this before, but both of them gave up after the first comment made on the pull request. One of them didn't make it optional. ;p

[12:39:14] <domicron> I mean azure offer LDAP for free right...
[12:39:40] <fnutt> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/914
[12:42:29] <brucekomike> in my opinion, IRC is not suitable for the "dumbo end-users".
[12:42:58] <domicron> its not really that different to slack to be honest
[12:46:27] <domicron> I suspect LDAP is probably a good approach. Its not rocket science to add some account creation methods for LDAP. I suspect I could even do it with an eggdrop and some TCL lol
[12:47:07] <domicron> I should probably find a better bot platform than eggdrop though

[14:17:44] <Dr_HaZaRd> I wanted to update the client by following the guide on the site https://thelounge.chat/docs/install-and-upgrade#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions but when I run the first commands to verify the nodejs versions, it comes out that nodejs is not installed. It's possible?
[14:17:44] <Dr_HaZaRd> I'm on Ubuntu, but the server is actually a seedbox and I didn't originally install TheLounge. What I do? I'm not very Linux savvy.
[14:19:06] <brucekomike> may you can try to type node
[14:19:22] <brucekomike> $ node -v
[14:19:39] <Dr_HaZaRd> Command 'node' not found, but can be installed with:
[14:19:39] <Dr_HaZaRd> apt install nodejs
[14:20:44] <brucekomike> if to install nodejs can solve this then you should have a try
[14:23:13] <Dr_HaZaRd> however TheLounge is already installed, I'm writing from it now. So the question is, if it's okay to update the client by installing nodejs and following the guide, if originally TheLounge was installed some other way?
[14:25:59] <brucekomike> I dont have a clue.

[18:49:28] <dav1d> Dr_HaZaRd, then what executes "index.js"? What actually starts lounge
[18:50:04] <dav1d> might be a separate user with its own node installation, a custom node installation in /opt which gets referenced in the systemd script, could literally be anything
[18:50:35] <dav1d> or rephrased, how do you start TL?

TL has been running for months, and before that I had a control panel with a button to start, stop and restart TL. but now i have requested my host to be root and i have lost the control panel .. now i have to do everything from command line and i don't know what is the command to start and stop TL.
