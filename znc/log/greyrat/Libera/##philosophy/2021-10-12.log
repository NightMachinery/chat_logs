[00:01:21] <arryana> now that i'd read
[00:01:58] <mannequin> no one asked you for permicion
[00:02:04] <mannequin> i'm asking you
[00:02:08] <arryana> people are behaving appallingly in crowds, and on planes
[00:02:11] <mannequin> what woud you prefer
[00:02:15] <mannequin> clay or fire
[00:02:20] <arryana> dude.  quit being a pest.
[00:02:21] <tinwhiskers> yeah. people really suck collectively.
[00:02:31] <tinwhiskers> 10% of people can really screw over 90%
[00:02:35] <mannequin> dude, quit being clueless
[00:03:21] <arryana> if you're going to try to insult me because i'm not interested in playing whatever game this is for you, i'll just /ignore you
[00:03:36] <mannequin> that is incorrect
[00:03:48] <mannequin> i'm not insulting you, i'm honest
[00:04:03] <arryana> uh huh
[00:04:05] <mannequin> we are missing eachothers points

[00:06:13] <mannequin> she had such of an opportunity
[00:06:15] <arryana> i think the biggest travel surprise was how entitled people were being
[00:06:26] <tinwhiskers> yeah
[00:06:39] <arryana> the sort of thing where they call boarding groups, and every asshat with a ticket gets in line, though it isn't their turn
[00:07:15] <arryana> total lack of consideration at security
[00:07:27] <arryana> almost nobody put away their tray, or made room for anyone else
[00:07:42] <tinwhiskers> how long was the flight?
[00:07:55] <arryana> i didn't take anything but carryon, so that was a minimal shitshow for me
[00:08:08] <arryana> an hour and some to London, ten hours for the next bit
[00:08:16] <tinwhiskers> do they still serve food/drinks on short legs?
[00:08:35] <arryana> i don't think they do in economy, they did in business.
[00:08:52] <tinwhiskers> oh. business class... niiice
[00:08:59] <tinwhiskers> that would help a bit
[00:08:59] <arryana> i think economy got water

[00:09:32] <tinwhiskers> hell, I'll go by bus to save a few dollars
[00:09:39] <tinwhiskers> but, yeah
[00:09:58] <mannequin> clueless sheep
[00:10:00] <arryana> if i were paying for it, i'd go for 'pleb plus', or main cabin 'extra'
[00:10:03] <tinwhiskers> probably bus is not ideal in your case
[00:10:11] <mannequin> i keep on telling you
[00:10:13] <arryana> the one that's below business but above coach
[00:10:15] <mannequin> just a messaner
[00:11:13] <arryana> there used to be a lot more friendly helpfulness stowing bags on the planes, too
[00:11:28] <arryana> but now everyone's bringing too many carryons, and several were the wrong size
[00:11:39] <tinwhiskers> wow, so people are even more assholes than they used to be. That's just great.
[00:11:56] <redempt1on> Fear. The dex raun up my spine.
[00:11:57] <arryana> which, of course, meant the flight chick had to go stow those underneath, which caused a delay...
[00:11:57] <redempt1on> *ran
[00:12:25] <tinwhiskers> I mean, obviously you'd expect that from the foaming antivaxxers, but I would have thought people with brains would be trying to be nice to each other.
[00:12:40] <arryana> i don't know if it's the masks, the isolation, or that people haven't had to be polite to each other for a while
[00:12:47] <tinwhiskers> mmm
[00:13:46] <arryana> i think a lot of people have lost their not-at-home manners
[00:13:55] <tinwhiskers> arryana: any vaccine mandates for flying on the airlines you've been using?
[00:14:06] <arryana> yes
[00:14:16] <tinwhiskers> oh. well, that's something at least

[00:15:53] <tinwhiskers> So how do you prove your vax status to fly?
[00:16:00] <arryana> cdc card
[00:16:04] <tinwhiskers> oh. ok
[00:16:23] <arryana> you have to submit a photo which is reviewed
[00:16:39] <tinwhiskers> yeah, we can get a paper version but it's a letter you have to ask for from some govt department-a-rather
[00:16:45] <arryana> then fill out an online passenger locator form
[00:16:51] <tinwhiskers> ah. OK.
[00:16:54] <arryana> yeah
[00:17:31] <arryana> and buy a covid test for days 2 and 8
[00:17:45] <arryana> those also get submitted as proof before you fly
[00:17:46] <tinwhiskers> oh. we don't eve have those either
[00:18:00] <arryana> it's a whole thing
[00:18:06] <tinwhiskers> just starting to get rapid testing here. We still rely on PCR so it's unpleasant
[00:18:12] <arryana> here too
[00:18:16] <tinwhiskers> oh, ok
[00:18:31] <arryana> before i left here, i had to get a pcr at the airport by someone official
[00:18:41] <arryana> the return test is a home pcr test
[00:18:46] <tinwhiskers> at the airport seems a little late
[00:19:02] <arryana> i mean, they do the test at the airport, two days before
[00:19:07] <tinwhiskers> oh. I see.
[00:19:34] <arryana> at least that's how it's working near edinburgh
[00:19:49] <tinwhiskers> ok
[00:20:33] <arryana> things are going to have to find a better new normal
[00:21:12] <tinwhiskers> yeah. Well, another 6 months and it will be fairly evenly spread everywhere so there's no real advantage in screening people any longer.
[00:21:22] * arryana nods
[00:21:31] <tinwhiskers> (except preventing new variants getting in)
[00:21:49] <arryana> i think it's more that, to track variants
[00:22:31] <tinwhiskers> yeah, we may see more lockdowns after that to slow spread again if we get a real nasty variant appear
[00:23:25] <arryana> i think the thing that surprised me most is how travel used to be fun and exciting for people.  now they're just big dickheads who would rather be eating doordash in front of their tvs
[00:23:54] <tinwhiskers> that sucks. It's nice when you get seated next to someone to have a chat with. I guess people chat less now.
[00:24:42] <arryana> i invariably have at least a civil exchange with whomever is seated nearest me
[00:24:47] <tinwhiskers> how many trips have you made ding the pandemic now?
[00:24:51] <arryana> three
[00:25:14] <tinwhiskers> nice (or not)
[00:25:29] <arryana> this will probably be the last for a while, there's not much left of my mother.
[00:25:38] <arryana> and work can wait until spring
[00:25:45] <tinwhiskers> oh. Sorry to hear that. I assumed it was for work.
[00:26:07] <arryana> no. my brother spent $20k of her money without telling her.
[00:26:15] <tinwhiskers> ah

[00:29:17] <arryana> so she can't walk, though she can stand assisted
[00:29:43] <tinwhiskers> oh :-(
[00:29:48] <arryana> yeah
[00:30:31] <arryana> while i was there she fell asleep in her scooter and would have fallen out had i not been there, so i suspect that's how she'll go.  and soon.
[00:31:06] <tinwhiskers> will you go over for the funeral or have you already discussed that stuff?
[00:31:15] <arryana> I've already arranged all of it

[01:07:01] <quetzl> it's like asking if parliament is the source of authrotiy in a nation
[01:07:15] <quetzl> yes, but if it becomes despotic and corrupt, the power isnt there
[01:07:56] <quetzl> the point is do you mak ea new parliament or give into the corruption and become one with it?
[01:08:12] <quetzl> i guess preseidencies are the answer to that
[01:09:49] <tinwhiskers> I don't think you can have one true mythology, and they are not voted for.
[01:10:43] <quetzl> well a church isn't a mythology
[01:10:52] <quetzl> a church is considered the body of believers in the mythology
[01:11:10] <tinwhiskers> but the mythology that would give them "the best argument" is a mythology
[01:11:31] <quetzl> doesnt matter
[01:11:36] <quetzl> it's their source of values
[01:11:45] <tinwhiskers> My made up story is better than yours?
[01:12:05] <tinwhiskers> fair enough I guess. I like some stories better than others.
[01:12:08] <quetzl> yeh it's a question of the believers not the myth
[01:12:29] <quetzl> is there a one true body of believers in a certain dogma/myth?
[01:12:31] <tinwhiskers> you surely cannot separate the myhthology from the holders of those myths
[01:12:46] <quetzl> so the catholics are right?
[01:12:51] <tinwhiskers> erm. no
[01:14:00] <quetzl> but you just answered suggesting the holders of the myth are inseperable from the myth, are the protestants the holders of the myth, or the catholics?
[01:14:12] <tinwhiskers> both
[01:14:38] <quetzl> so both are right
[01:14:45] <tinwhiskers> no
[01:15:00] <quetzl> ok
[01:15:06] <quetzl> so both are wrong'?
[01:15:28] <tinwhiskers> not any more than Jack and the beanstalk is more corrct that Goldilocks and the three little bears

[10:56:15] <plankster> so youre saying reality was designed?
[10:56:31] <amigojapan> Not sure. Maybe
[10:56:32] <plankster> my reality differs from that
[10:56:54] <amigojapan> plankster: reality is shared not personal

[10:57:24] <amigojapan> plankster: one of us is wrong
[10:57:31] <plankster> not necessarily
[10:57:56] <amigojapan> Reality was either designed it it was not
[10:58:00] <plankster> we could each of us inhabit our own realities, and mesh our realities with those of others on a case by case basis
[10:58:16] <amigojapan> That is crazy
[10:58:20] <plankster> why
[10:58:51] <amigojapan> Cause having a different idea of reality from what it really is is what defines being crazy
[10:59:08] <plankster> and you get to decide what the sane interpretation of reality is?
[10:59:17] <plankster> who made you philosopher-king
[10:59:22] <amigojapan> Doctors do
[10:59:35] <plankster> last i checked doctors dont have much to say on the nature of reality
[11:00:07] <plankster> i could ask my aunt but shes probably busy helping her patients
[11:00:23] <causative> plankster, you're making the mistake of substituting the social realm for the reality realm - as if one has to be a "philosopher-king" to make sane judgments about reality
[11:00:38] <causative> "philosopher-king" is a concept from the social realm
[11:00:41] <plankster> im not making a mistake, im making a point
[11:00:47] <plankster> and having fun with wordplay
[11:01:05] <causative> your point is a mistake
[11:01:09] <plankster> why
[11:01:19] <causative> because you are substituting the social realm for the reality realm
[11:01:20] <plankster> with less condescension, pls
[11:01:25] <plankster> im not
[11:01:32] <amigojapan> plankster: is a person comes in and says  "there is a person besides me telling me to kill others"but the seat is empty. Then he will be pronounced crazy not "maybe he is looking at another reality
[11:01:56] <causative> you are saying that by claiming there is one true reality, amigojapan is acting like a "philosopher-king" i.e. you see it as him overreaching his social station, making commands and demands that his social status does not warrant
[11:02:09] <causative> this is a concept from the social realm
[11:02:14] <causative> it is not applicable to the question of what is real
[11:02:37] <plankster> i called him that because he presumed to define what reality "really is"
[11:02:41] <causative> a person may overstep his station, and still be right - whether he oversteps or not is irrelevant to whether he is right
[11:02:50] <causative> whether he "presumes too much" for his social station, is not relevant to whether he is right
[11:02:52] <plankster> and i purposefully used an overloaded term for humorous effect
[11:03:02] <plankster> it appears not to have landed
[11:03:06] <causative> it's fallacious to apply this social concept to the question of whether he is right
[11:03:14] <plankster> well theres your mistake
[11:03:21] <plankster> thinking i was applying a social concept
[11:03:26] <plankster> i told you i wasnt
[11:03:32] <causative> I explained to you how you were
[11:03:41] <plankster> and i explained how i wasnt
[11:03:46] <plankster> this isnt fun
[11:04:08] <causative> then what was your explanation? I gave an explanation, you gave a denial, not an explanation in return
[11:04:50] <plankster> amigojapan im less interested in those who differ in their perception of objective reality than in those who differ in their interpretation of objective reality
[11:05:05] <plankster> does the individual interpretation not define an individual, subjective reality?
[11:05:32] <causative> it does not
[11:05:43] <plankster> lets just assume im not talking to you any more
[11:05:49] <causative> an individual interpretation defines an individual, subjective interpretation
[11:05:53] <causative> not a reality
[11:05:58] <causative> belief is not reality
[11:06:05] <plankster> boring
[11:06:49] <causative> you must admit into your ontology the concept that a person can think something, and *be wrong* about it
[11:06:50] <amigojapan> plankster: you say "boring"cause your rather hear fantasy
[11:07:05] <causative> it's not the case that everybody is right all the time because whatever they think just creates a new reality in which they are right
[11:07:08] <causative> that's not how the world works
[11:07:13] <causative> people can think things, and *be wrong* about them
[11:07:18] <plankster> i say boring because anybody who makes definite statements about the nature of reality is probably wrong and not interested in sussing things out
[11:07:26] <plankster> like this guy
[11:07:48] <causative> with that claim, it sounds like you're making a definite statement about the nature of reality
[11:08:06] <plankster> in your subjective reality, perhaps
[11:08:22] <plankster> in mine, i said "probably"
[11:08:43] <causative> well, that is good, every belief should be held only as a matter of probability
[11:08:52] <amigojapan> plankster: reality is just the realm were we share reality with other sane people
[11:08:52] <plankster> you must be fun at parties
[11:08:54] <causative> but we don't have to say "probably" all the time - it is understood
[11:09:15] <plankster> there we go with this arbitrary line-drawing between the sane and insane again
[11:09:27] <plankster> do the insane not inhabit our shared reality as well?
[11:09:49] <amigojapan> plankster: sometimes they see hallucinations
[11:09:51] <causative> when we make any claim there is always a chance we are wrong, which we should keep in mind, even if we are very confident
[11:10:11] <plankster> naturally
[11:10:12] <causative> but we don't have to mention this chance every time

[11:11:18] <causative> the concept that a person can be *wrong*, implies that there is something *right*, some ideal that the person is seeking and may fall short of
[11:11:23] <amigojapan> No plankster if you know it is a hallucination it becomes a pseudo hallucination
[11:11:40] <plankster> and what about shared hallucinations?
[11:11:45] <plankster> like the value of money
[11:12:06] <causative> that's not a hallucination, money has value because you can use it to buy things
[11:12:14] <causative> which is empirically demonstrable
[11:15:18] <plankster> are there some hallucinations that are mandatory to be considered sane?
[11:15:24] <amigojapan> plankster: not a hallucination, that is a belief
[11:15:37] <plankster> whats the difference
[11:16:10] <causative> a hallucination is an exaggerated way of describing a false belief
[11:16:12] <causative> not all beliefs are false
[11:16:22] <causative> some beliefs correspond to the truth, some do not
[11:16:42] <amigojapan> plankster: money has no real value. Or shared belief in its value is what causes us to use it
[11:17:06] <amigojapan> No causative that is a delusion
[11:17:08] <plankster> i think its a trickier issue than that
[11:17:30] <causative> what is a delusion, that some beliefs correspond to the truth and some do not?
[11:18:23] <causative> some things are right, some things are wrong.
[11:19:03] <amigojapan> causative: I am saying" 4:46 PM <causative> a hallucination is an exaggerated way of describing a false belief"is what a "delusion"is, not a hallucination
[11:20:02] <causative> ah, well, he was trying to apply "hallucination" to the concept that money has value - so I infer he does not mean a literal hallucination, but just a false belief (although in this case it is not false that money has value)
[11:20:19] <causative> he is using hallucination synonymously to delusion
[11:21:02] <amigojapan> Ok but they are not synonyms at all
[11:21:30] <causative> well, "hallucination" can be used metaphorically as a synonym for delusion
[11:21:58] <causative> not literally in the sense of seeing a visual image that is not present
[11:22:16] <amigojapan> A hallucination is an image you actually see while awake that is not part of reality
[11:22:30] <causative> yes, that is the literal sense
[11:22:41] <amigojapan> Ok
[11:23:57] <amigojapan> I had never heard of it having a metaphorical sense
[11:25:11] <causative> anything can be used a metaphorical way

[11:43:25] <amigojapan> Hi pussipupu
[11:43:25] <arryana> they seem to have missed me
[11:45:17] <causative> pussipupu, something could be valued but not have value - suppose I am dying of thirst in the desert, and I see in the distance a gourd in the sand, which I imagine to be full of water, so I value it highly and run towards it
[11:45:32] <causative> but it is a dry gourd, or perhaps only a rock
[11:45:39] <causative> I valued it, but it did not have value

[11:46:03] <causative> so we must have at least the concept of "true" value, as distinct from the value assigned at a particular moment
[11:46:14] <arryana> it's got value if you carry it to the nearest water.  now you have a cup.
[11:46:42] <causative> well, that's outside the scenario
[11:46:47] <causative> maybe there is no need for a cup
[11:47:07] <arryana> if you're arguing extrapolated meaning, why is that any mor outside the scenario than anything?
[11:47:33] <causative> anyway I don't value it *as a cup* in the scenario, I'm valuing it for the water inside it, of which there is none
[11:47:36] <arryana> just because you valued it for something you were incorrect about doesn't then make it valueless
[11:48:50] <causative> it may or may not be completely valueless to me, but it certainly doesn't have the value I thought it had
[11:49:04] <arryana> that just makes you wrong, not the item valueless
[11:49:45] <causative> in the scenario, the item has very little true value - maybe not 0, but not anything close to what I assigned

[11:50:03] <arryana> again.  that's just because your assumption was wrong.
[11:50:03] <causative> the great majority of the value I assigned was not truly present
[11:50:11] <pussipupu> Things can have value for a purpose as well as to an agent
[11:50:15] <causative> this proves that mere assignment of value is not sufficient to create value
[11:50:17] <arryana> i don't get how you being wrong has anything to do with the concept in general
[11:50:27] <pussipupu> but it's still not a property of the valued/valuable thing
[11:50:32] <arryana> ^
[11:51:00] <causative> perhaps not pussipupu , but at least your first statement, that "to have value" is the same as "to be valued," is disproven by the gourd example
[11:51:10] <arryana> it really isnt
[11:51:25] <causative> because in this case the gourd is valued (incorrectly), but has slim to none true value
[11:51:41] * arryana wears the gourd as a hat to protect herself from the sun
[11:51:51] * arryana knocks on the gourd to make music to amuse herself
[11:51:57] <pussipupu> It's not valid "incorrectly", you value it differently
[11:52:01] <causative> pussipupu, the value of an object is distinct from the value assigned to that object by any agents at any particular time
[11:52:17] * pussipupu makes gourd samosas
[11:52:21] <arryana> ooooh
[11:52:26] <arryana> that's a gourd idea
[11:52:39] <causative> we may say that the true value can only be spoken of with respect to an agent, but the agent can be wrong about the quantity of value
[11:52:48] <causative> his valuation is not the same as the true value that it has to him
[11:53:02] <causative> the true value is different from his valuation
[11:54:05] <causative> or, to take a more ordinary example, when a person values a stock, they can easily be wrong - they think it is worth a certain amount, but they buy it and then the stock crashes
[11:54:14] <causative> so it wasn't worth that amount
[11:55:07] <arryana> you seem to be conflating people being wrong with inherent lack of value
[11:55:44] <arryana> and if a stock crashes, it -was- worth, and then wasn't after the fact.
[11:55:50] <arryana> that's also irrelevant to the point at hand.
[11:56:05] <arryana> so i'm not sure what you're trying to prove

[11:58:59] <causative> I hope you would agree that "the value of a gourd in the desert to a man dying of thirst depends on whether there is water in it, and stocks can be overvalued."
[11:59:29] <arryana> i can't say i agree with the first.  and i don't see how the second has anything to do with pussipupu's statement.
[12:00:20] <causative> you don't agree that the value of a gourd in the desert to a man dying of thirst depends on whether there is water in it?
[12:00:25] <arryana> nope
[12:02:56] <arryana> i can think of at least three other uses for that gourd
[12:05:26] <pussipupu> If stocks are overvalued then it's in terms of opinion vs informed reflective opinion
[12:05:43] <pussipupu> It doesn't change the nature of value to a thing inherent in the valued thing
[12:05:45] * arryana pushes a tea to pussipupu
[12:06:06] * pussipupu offers a plate of shortbread
[12:06:18] <arryana> oooh
[12:06:19] <arryana> ta
[12:06:27] <causative> pussipupu, I didn't say it was inherent in the valued thing, you're arguing against a claim I didn't make
[12:07:22] <causative> what I said was that how an agent values a thing is different from the actual value of that thing (to that agent)
[12:07:25] <pussipupu> "the value of a thing is distinct from the value assigned to it..."
[12:07:41] <causative> yes, that is a statement I agree with
[12:07:50] <causative> I didn't say it was inherent in the thing
[12:08:00] <causative> I said that assignations can be wrong
[12:08:02] * arryana takes a sharp bit of rock and carves designs into the gourd, then gives it to pussipupu
[12:08:19] <pussipupu> "actual value" is the degree to which it's valued or on a meta level the degree to which it would be valued by a hypothetical informed agent
[12:08:54] <pussipupu> you agree with it because I was quoting you :o
[12:08:55] <causative> the latter, not the former
[12:09:17] <causative> actual value is not (necessarily) the degree to which it's valued - it's the degree to which it would be valued by the hypothetical fully-informed agent
[12:09:48] <arryana> that assumes a seriously limited idea of creativity
[12:09:54] <arryana> i gotta reject it as unrealistic

[12:11:38] <arryana> indeed
[12:11:40] <amigojapan> Why not causative
[12:11:41] <causative> the buyer thinks the value is greater than the price he bought it for
[12:11:46] <causative> and he may be right

[12:12:44] <pussipupu> it's worthless to a hypothetical thirsty person who doesn't like engraved gourds
[12:12:58] <causative> amigojapan, I mean that if I buy a churro for $3 to eat it, then I must value the churro at *greater* than $3 to me

[12:20:55] <causative> amigojapan, so you're saying you disagree with pussipupu , you say that some things do have intrinsic value?
[12:21:41] <pussipupu> There are things we value for themselves, such as other persons and cats, and there are things we value because they have instrumental value for us, such as money
[12:22:06] <amigojapan> causative: I guess I agree. Even water is pretty valuable intrinsically
[12:22:10] <pussipupu> causative: I don't, though at a stretch you might be able to say that of an agent which values itself as an agent
[12:23:14] <causative> pussipupu, even other people and cats are usually means-to-an-end, not ends-in-themselves
[12:23:30] <causative> e.g. you own a cat because you enjoy the company
[12:23:35] <arryana> wow.  if you believe that, it tells me a lot about your life
[12:23:42] <causative> the end is "company," the means is "owning a cat"

[13:38:44] <causative> emotion is instinct

[13:39:41] <arryana> in adults, it's tempered with experience and maturity
[13:40:15] <causative> amigojapan, so it's not always wrong, but as long as you are relying on instinct you are acting as an animal does - that is, in the state of nature. You aren't changing or transforming.

[13:44:44] <causative> instincts - and emotions - can be understood as useful heuristics. In the situations where they arise, a certain behavior, triggered by the emotion, is (or was, ancestrally) usually adaptive for the purpose of reproductive fitness

[14:16:40] <causative> if you say, "I don't agree with that, here's why..." that's a nice way to disagree
[14:16:59] <causative> if you say, "No, I don't agree with that, and it's childish and crazy to think so," that's a way to disagree with the intent of making the person look bad
[14:17:11] * arryana rolls her eyes
[14:17:31] <arryana> tell you what.  you get to change my discussion style in one way if i get to do the same to you.
[14:17:59] <arryana> otherwise, deal with the fact that people express themselvea differently like an adult.
[14:19:03] * amigojapan thinks causative will soon join me in arrayanas ignore list
[14:20:33] <arryana> if you want to take my discussion style as a personal attack and an attempt to 'make you look bad', that's all on you, it has nothing to do with me.
[14:22:54] <arryana> from where i sit, the impression a person makes is based on their own words and actions, not someone else's
[14:23:43] <arryana> but maybe you rely on the opinions of other people more than i do, i can't guess
[14:26:25] <causative> if you want to have a discussion that goes back and forth, where people disagree and argue their sides without getting mad, you have to both be willing to play nice and not try to insult or discredit the person
[14:26:59] <causative> there is a natural tendency - an instinct - that causes people to treat debates over beliefs, as a status contest, and try to use disparaging language, strawmen and personal attacks to "win" the status contest
[14:27:05] <arryana> nobody's mad
[14:27:30] <arryana> you're really determined to ride this victim thing, so i'm just going to step away from talking to you.
[14:27:54] <causative> it's a strong instinct that essentially everyone has - both you and the person you are talking to will have this status instinct
[14:28:25] <arryana> whatever.  not interested in further discussion.
[14:28:49] <causative> but it's undesirable to let it have free reign. If one person gives in and makes it about status, it becomes far more difficult for the other person to remain neutral, because their status instinct will be screaming at them to retaliate
[14:29:10] <arryana> if you keep at it, i'm just going to /ignore you.
[14:29:20] <mannequin> she likes that command
[14:29:42] <causative> for this reason, one needs to be carefully neutral if one wishes to have a discussion without conflict or anger, just seeking after the truth
[14:29:54] <arryana> have it your way, /ignore it is
