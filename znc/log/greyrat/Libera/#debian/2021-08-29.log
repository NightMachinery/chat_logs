[00:06:50] <holgersson> Hi, I've set up a debian 11 from a nightly image on an rasberry pi B+. Now I'd like to install speedtest-cli and would prefer the way through apt instead of pip. From this site I read that it's packaged for debian 11/bullseye, but 'apt update && apt install speedtest-cli' complains 'unable to locate package speedtest-cli': https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/speedtest-cli
[00:06:50] <holgersson> Could you please clarify if the packge is in the repo and if I can actually install it?

[03:37:27] <knotMez> sney what happens if you leave it enabled?
[03:38:20] <sney> since its sources.list entry is just 'bullseye' rather than bullseye-multimedia or so, apt treats it as a normal mirror, and will install packages from there as dependencies for other stuff

[14:50:06] <PMT> i want to check if linux added any quirks that might fix this since debian's last kernel update
[14:51:01] <PMT> if you want to try and track this down, you could try booting older bullseye kernels between 4.19 and 5.10 to see if they break the same way. you could also blacklist the specific kernel module for that device so that you can boot in 5.10 if you just want a working system sans the device for now.

[16:19:35] <PMT> (I recently went down the rabbit hole of wanting to color all the background text until EOL on something that didn't print the whole line, so some of the complications of doing so are still fresh in my mind.)

[16:21:58] <ede> if DE influences how xterm behaves i consider it broken
[16:22:23] <PMT> perhaps, i'm just trying to understand what input you are providing and what is happening instead
[16:23:01] <ede> to mark text in a xterm you 1. can drag from start to end. sucks with more than DOS resolution.
[16:23:31] <ede> 2. you can doubleclick and mark word-wise. better handling, but sucks with word delimiters.
[16:23:51] <ede> 3. you doubleclick the first word and rightclick the last word.
[16:24:11] <ede> which is by far the most convenient and reliable method.
[16:24:12] <ede> usually.
[16:24:22] <PMT> I did not know #3, actually.

[16:25:35] <ede> mouse sucks generally from a physical point of view, it's just cheap crap assembled in chinese sweatshops.
[16:26:08] <ede> i use #3 whereever possible (that's about 99%) of all cases, unless i want to just get a part of a word
[16:26:24] <ede> first time i see it misbehaving, and i have no idea what it could be
[16:26:29] <PMT> i go back and forth on mice and trackballs and touchpads as input devices - because actual direct touch isn't usually precise enough for what we'd want, but the indirection makes some things more cumbersome sometimes.
[16:26:38] <PMT> So you're trying #3, and what is it doing instead?
[16:26:55] <ede> especially after seeing that it works on the copy of that line
[16:27:23] <culix> does bullseye still considers /etc/default? 
[16:27:41] <ede> if you're a bit too far right with the marking (drag or rightclick, i think it works for both of them) it will mark the whole screen line including the EOL
[16:27:42] <PMT> it still exists and is used on my bullseye laptop install, so i'm gonna go with yes, why
[16:28:57] <culix> PMT: did an upgrade from buster and my bind9 settings in /etc/default are not recognized
[16:29:49] <PMT> being ignored, or erroring out?

[21:02:40] <sputnik> evening. guys, i get this: https://i.imgur.com/qaOukRu.png and it's a fresh install of the bullseye. without 'quiet' kernel boot parameter i can see that's the output of scripts local-premount, local-top and local-block. anyone has a clue why do i get these?
[21:05:05] <sputnik> btw, i get this on two machines: poweredge C6320 and some supermicro node / blade. but on vmware virtual machine i don't get these messages though

[22:33:17] <tp43_> recommendation for docs of setting up sudo on debian 11 bullseye
[22:34:12] <dodo> man 5 sudoers?
[22:35:48] <onelegend> ok tp43_ 
[22:35:50] <onelegend> so basically
[22:35:54] <onelegend> you first install it
[22:35:56] <onelegend> su
[22:35:59] <onelegend> enter password:
[22:36:02] <onelegend> then you're root
[22:36:06] <onelegend> and then you do apt install sudo
[22:36:08] <tp43_> I am doing #adduser userName sudo. -> already a member of sudo. But then when I try to use it like $sudo whoami, it isays n is not in the sudoers file. 
[22:36:20] <onelegend> tp43_: you use usermod -a -G sudo username
[22:36:22] <onelegend> and then you logout
[22:36:26] <onelegend> and log back in
[22:38:04] <tp43_> onelegend Like close the terminal and re-open. It didn't work. Do I have to logout of the desktop?
[22:38:16] <dodo> tp43_: newgrp sudo
[22:39:31] <tp43_> dodo, no luck
[22:40:13] <dodo> tp43_: who did you run that command as?
[22:40:17] <dodo> tp43_: use your regular user
[22:40:27] <tp43_> dodo, oh I did root
[22:40:47] <tp43_> dodo, yep, it works, thx so much
[22:40:47] <dodo> it updates the current shell session
[22:40:52] <dodo> yw
[22:41:33] <tp43_> can I add it to bashrc?
[22:42:16] <dodo> you shouldn't
[22:42:54] <tp43_> ok
[22:43:41] <tp43_> I will remember the command newgrp

[22:47:34] <SpeakerToMeat> Hello all.
[22:47:54] <SpeakerToMeat> Question, there's no apt way to get gtk for python 2 on bullseye, is there?
[22:48:59] <sney> most python2 packages were removed for bullseye
[22:49:40] <bozra> ,v python2*
[22:49:41] <judd> No package named 'python2*' was found in amd64.
[22:49:46] <sney> depending on what you're doing, you could possibly use the buster packages, but python 2 is obsolete and so it's just going to keep getting harder to support 
[22:50:27] <Blondie101010> python 2 is officially out of support since jan 1st 2020, including security fixes
[22:50:37] <Blondie101010> so you should just get a better/more up to date package
