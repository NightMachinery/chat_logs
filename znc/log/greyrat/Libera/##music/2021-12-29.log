[07:47:42] <piercedwater-> pretty fun game!
[07:48:19] <artao> we had atari 2600 and NES. idr what football game we had on nes, but the m-network football game for the 2600
[07:48:32] <artao> i have a sweet 2600 actually. easily worth $300
[07:48:39] <piercedwater-> nice
[07:48:56] <piercedwater-> i don't remember much about our atari
[07:48:58] <artao> i've considered selling it cuz i never use it, but then i wouldn't have it if i ever DID wnat to
[07:49:07] <piercedwater-> yep
[07:49:21] <piercedwater-> can you connect it to a modern tv?
[07:50:07] <artao> mine is in excellent quality, except the case which has a cracked lid. but it is one of them faux-wood cases. so everything inside is still nice. two working paddle sets, tho sadly both are Pong Paddles. I need a set of Driving paddles. ... or vice versa. IDR lol
[07:50:10] <artao> and 4 joysticks
[07:50:17] <artao> not chewed on or anything
[07:50:34] <piercedwater-> sounds nice
[07:50:41] <artao> idr how many games. tho i do have that one space fighting game that requires the button pad, and i don't have the button pad
[07:50:45] <piercedwater-> no more game consoles in our house
[07:50:47] <artao> it is
[07:51:06] <artao> like i said, thought of selling it. but then, i don't NEED that money, and it'll only go up in value
[07:51:18] <piercedwater-> yarp
[07:51:23] <artao> i've got an NES too, but not in very good condition. tho it works
[07:51:37] <artao> a gameboy with a non-working screen and broken battery cover which is taped on
[07:51:40] <piercedwater-> treasure island was a good game for me on NES
[07:51:54] <piercedwater-> dem graphics
[07:51:55] <artao> nvr had that one. nor heard of it
[07:52:18] <artao> one of my faves i've got on the 2600 is Video Olympics
[07:52:27] <piercedwater-> oh hmm never played that one
[07:52:36] <artao> it's basically many versions of Pong, some of which allow four player -- with the two sets of paddles
[07:52:51] <artao> it's fun to play it just two-player, each controlling two paddles
[07:53:09] <piercedwater-> i could play pong all day
[07:53:21] <piercedwater-> that and sim city
[07:53:28] <artao> and a Combat-like game, but on "realistic" terrain, and you have two tanks to control. switching between them
[07:53:28] <piercedwater-> dr mario, etc
[07:53:36] <piercedwater-> cool
[07:53:53] <artao> i don't have much good for my nes. i want zelda and metroid, but FUCK they're pricey!
[07:54:03] <piercedwater-> lol
[07:54:21] <artao> and Yar's Revenge, on my 2600. With which I'm meaning to set a world record
[07:54:32] <piercedwater-> oh?
[07:54:35] <artao> ... largely cuz their isn't yet a record for the mode i play
[07:54:39] <artao> heh heh ;)
[07:54:43] <piercedwater-> niiice
[07:54:48] <artao> or at least not last i checked
[07:54:55] <artao> still, i wanna put in a respectable one
[07:55:25] <artao> it's kinda complex to submit a record actually
[07:55:50] <artao> ther'es separate ones for emulator and hardware, and if it's hardware you have to show the hookups and record that you're actually playing the hardware
[07:56:08] <artao> emulator you have to screen-cap and record yourself actually playing it
[07:56:09] <piercedwater-> oic
[07:56:12] <piercedwater-> never knew
[07:56:30] <artao> actual arcade games you have to actually open them up and show that the guts haven't been modified
[07:57:05] <artao> the movie High Score is quite interesting

[08:02:53] <artao> but it fell on the floor and no longer works :(
[08:02:58] <piercedwater-> rip
[08:03:09] <artao> most likely fixable, but i haven't opened it up
[08:04:05] <artao> probably an electrical component came loose, but i'd need more soldering practice before i tried tho
[08:04:32] <piercedwater-> ah yeah. i'm horrible at soldering :(
[08:04:48] <piercedwater-> i have to have both elbows on the table or w/e to make it work
[08:06:47] <artao> again, that thing would be worth a fair bit of money if it worked
[08:06:49] <artao> <sigh>
[08:07:03] <artao> gorram gravity
[08:07:13] <piercedwater-> murphy's law as well
[08:09:28] <artao> and me for keeping it on top of the speaker where it could easily fall off if the speaker got tipped over
[08:16:25] <piercedwater-> currently digging through archive.org for things to organize/hoard LOL
[08:18:01] <artao> fun
[08:19:29] <artao> i'm considering if i should just go back to bed. only been up like 4 hrs

[21:01:10] <morlog> when you only need to tell something to turn on or off you dont really need speed
[21:01:17] <artao> hm. i suppose
[21:01:22] <artao> that could just be 1-bit
[21:01:31] <morlog> 2
[21:01:33] <artao> baud would be irrelevant
[21:01:38] <artao> why 2
[21:01:54] <artao> on or off. 0 or 1
[21:03:08] <artao> morlog do you drummers ever drum in morse code?
[21:03:37] <artao> no such thing as "first row" or anything in a drum circle
[21:03:47] <artao> go where thou wilt, play what thou wilt
[21:03:56] <morlog> there is inner and outer circles
[21:04:02] <morlog> and rows
[21:04:09] <artao> i've found that sometimes there's someone who kinda tries to (and succeeds in) "take over" or "lead" the beat
[21:04:16] <morlog> also a beat epicenter
[21:04:18] <artao> kinda ego flexing
[21:04:27] <artao> i like to counter-beat to them
[21:04:29] <artao> heh heh
[21:04:35] <artao> DRUM FIGHT
[21:04:45] <morlog> depends on your drum
[21:05:27] <morlog> the deeper the bass the more controll you have over the rythm

[21:06:21] <artao> srry, i've forgotten my Hebrew .... what's that?
[21:07:05] <rindolf> artao: a song i like - "grey hit/blow"

[21:11:12] <artao> morlog i finally got my new WTB Velociraptors on my bike
[21:11:16] <artao> aahhh, nice
[21:11:23] <artao> just in time too. snow
[21:11:25] <artao> real snow
[21:11:28] <artao> and cold
[21:11:31] <artao> \o/ WOOT
[21:12:08] <morlog> watch out for the wet spots
[21:12:41] <morlog> up in colorado riding on the snow was like riding on hard pack sand
[21:12:49] <morlog> except for the wet spots
[21:12:56] <morlog> those were like greased glass
[21:13:02] <artao> moreso hidden ice under tire slush
[21:13:16] <morlog> slush was fine up there
[21:13:18] <artao> tire ruts can really suck a tire in
[21:13:21] <artao> or out
[21:13:35] <artao> i'm quite good at snow biking tho. so there's that

[21:45:14] <nativetexan> just right here
[21:45:16] <Panther> :)
[21:45:35] <artao> i'd estimate like -2 LUFS or so

[21:45:48] <artao> or higher
[21:45:57] <Panther> This next part is louder.

[21:46:18] <Panther> The house should shake when this plays.
[21:46:20] <artao> OH
[21:46:29] <artao> i have the input preamp turned up on my mixer
[21:46:32] <artao> D;OH
[21:46:40] <artao> oh
[21:46:42] <artao> that is nice

[21:46:43] <Panther> You got mixed up :)
[21:46:46] <artao> feelin it
[21:47:03] <artao> i know my speakers can do at least 35hz, cuz that's where i can start hearing a tone
[21:47:08] <artao> a bit of clicking prior to that
[21:47:22] <artao> but i also don't have a DC couple interface
[21:47:27] <artao> which sux
[21:47:38] <artao> Panther is there somewhere that says the track and artist?
[21:47:43] <Panther> I do :)
[21:48:02] <Panther> This is Dream Theater Hell's Kitchen - Lines in the Sand.
[21:48:22] <Panther> There is an interface to put the music in that we are working on.
[21:48:37] <Panther> So it will display the show title, but it's not up yet.
[21:48:46] <artao> ahhhhh i see
[21:48:52] <Panther> It has to deal with youtube, sporify, itunes, etc...
[21:48:58] <artao> i was guessing the harder side of 70s prog rock
[21:49:03] <artao> sooooooooo ... about right, yeah
[21:49:06] <Panther> Whatever the ppl are using for their playlists.
[21:49:07] <artao> yeah
[21:49:13] <Panther> This song came ont in 99
[21:49:24] <artao> youtube standard is like -8 LUFS iirc
[21:49:37] <artao> varies from -8 to even -12 for some platforms
[21:49:57] <artao> i sometimes forget when i turn up something on my mixer LOL
[21:49:57] <Panther> I have the PC out to 30, and then another preamp on the audio interface set to like 70%.
[21:50:33] <artao> uh ... what levels tho? RMS LUFS/dbfs. 
[21:50:47] <artao> okay, so what's the name of the keyboardist in DT here?
[21:50:50] <artao> i can't remember
[21:50:53] <Panther> This plays through the PC out, into the audio interface preamp, then back to the DAW via USB, and then out to the Internet with a VST. :)
[21:51:31] <artao> um .... VU meter?
[21:51:45] <Panther> Petrucci is the only one I know of for sure.
[21:51:54] <artao> no
[21:51:55] <artao> um
[21:52:02] <artao> perhaps i'm thinking of a different group
[21:52:26] <Panther> There is a VU meter in the daw, and also a little light that goes around the preamp input that goes around green until it gets all the way around and then it turns red :)
[21:52:28] <artao> somethin with a K?
[21:52:36] <artao> can you use VST plugins?
[21:52:43] <Panther> I do

[21:53:09] <artao> wow. cool
[21:53:49] <Panther> I used to use a de-esser, an EQ, and a few other things, but this is enough.
