[00:00:23] <PapuaHardyNet> sorry, I don't follow American government news, so it is surprising to me
[00:02:01] <quanticle> You'll probably be applying using Form 1023-EZ (unless you plan on taking in more than $50,000 worth of donations in a year). That has a $275 filing fee, and the status of applications can be tracked here: https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/wheres-my-application-for-tax-exempt-status
[00:02:02] <Robomot> Where's My Application for Tax-Exempt Status? | Internal Revenue Service (This article describes the tax exemption application process. Organizations can find out where their applications may be in the process and whether they should call to check on status.)
[00:02:31] <quanticle> As of now, the IRS has only processed applications through May 
[00:02:39] <quanticle> So they're catching up, it looks like, but slowly
[00:03:45] <shawwwn> quanticle: Thanks for that info!
[00:04:27] <quanticle> I'm guessing you've already filed your articles of incorporation, right?
[00:05:07] <shawwwn> Yeah, it was surprisingly only $26 and instant in MO
[00:05:17] <shawwwn> Form 1023-EZ	May 20, 2021
[00:05:27] <shawwwn> looks like it'll take >3 months

[00:05:47] <quanticle> Might be a bit sooner, but yeah, that's about the lag right now
[00:05:52] <shawwwn> well, still worth doing. it's retroactive
[00:05:55] <quanticle> Yep
[00:06:01] <shawwwn> so I think we can apply for benefits now, as long as we file
[00:07:39] <quanticle> Yes, but if they want to verify that you're a tax exempt non-profit, they're not going to be able to do that until the IRS actually issues the letter

[00:22:36] <PapuaHardyNet> I can run GPT2-medium on a thinkpad x230. It feels surreal
[00:22:55] <quanticle> Yeah, NNs are surprisingly cheap to run
[00:22:59] <quanticle> It's the training that sucks
[00:23:23] <gwern> that's one hardware overhang. hard to train once, but then you can run it anywhere at huge scale
[00:23:47] <PapuaHardyNet> well, gpt2-medium used to crash regularly on my xps13. Now I see it was because I had only 8gigs of ram, and it wasn't the CPU that is the bottleneck
[00:23:51] <gwern> as I mentioned, the hardware to train alphazero could play a pro-level game of go simultaneously with every go player in the world
[00:24:44] <quanticle> Yeah, that's another thing that gwern has talked about: if you have insufficient CPU, your code runs slowly. If you have insufficient RAM, your code doesn't run at all
[00:24:51] <Betawolf> the gap from 'as good as a human' to 'better than all humans combined' really isn't that big
[00:25:02] <quanticle> It's one of the reasons I stuff my machines with RAM far beyond what is "reasonable"
[00:25:32] <kuudes> that seems the correct choice
[00:26:04] <quanticle> Also why I'm hyped about those 512GB RAM sticks that Samsung demonstrated last week
[00:26:28] <PapuaHardyNet> yep, I now get why you were excited about it

[08:27:41] <quanticle> Which probably goes back to what adiabatic hypothesized: there was a burst of attention towards variable fonts a while ago, and people who have come later don't hear any news about them and thus don't know
[08:28:15] <adiabatic> last I heard of them they required an OS that I refused to run. Now that I'm on that OS, variable fonts have mostly dropped off my radar and at any rate my favorite foundries haven't made any variable fonts

[08:34:00] * Obormot\Arcturus stares at the screenshot number
[08:34:05] <gwern> yes, as I said, to show more columns and also because I normally browse at smaller %
[08:34:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> No but you pasted it twice
[08:34:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hence the confusion
[08:34:50] * gwern squints

[08:35:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Cool. Yeah, it looks good. I see you removed "Notable"
[08:35:51] <gwern> yes, and did a heck of a lot of reorganizing to get the sections to have almost identical line counts and line lengths
[08:36:13] <adiabatic> so you manually edited the categories so they'd have the same number of items in each?
[08:36:25] <gwern> indeed
[08:36:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> I just had an idea for making the <hr> after "Popular" look good enough to display
[08:36:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> But can I do it...
[08:38:34] <quanticle> The other day, I realized, I'm not a neoreactionary, I'm a gwernoactionary. I'm okay with monarchy, but only so long as the monarch is gwern.
[08:38:36] <quanticle> I thought Obormot\Arcturus would make a good monarch for while too, until I realized that his first edict would be to throw me into the font gulags.
[08:38:58] <adiabatic> there's no reason to do that
[08:39:05] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: what I was actually thinking was that perhaps the links should be made bigger or bolder in some way. plenty of whitespace to use and I'm not sure how readable as 'titles' the links currently are
[08:39:06] <adiabatic> you just don't get the freedom to choose bad fonts
[08:39:11] <adiabatic> no gulag needed
[08:39:38] <quanticle> Well, you'd also need to seize the means of (font) production
[08:39:44] <quanticle> To ensure that bad fonts don't get created
[08:39:44] <gwern> adiabatic: no no, in obormerica, you totally have the freedom to choose any font you wish. but frozen peaches doesn't mean freedom from *consequences*!
[08:40:31] <quanticle> Yes, and the consequences here are simple and straightforward: gulag
[08:41:14] <gwern>  AMERICAN: "You know, in America, we have freedom of speech. We can say 'down with Helvetica!'" OBORMERICAN: "And in Obormerica, we have freedom of speech too; we too can say 'down with Helvetica!'."
[08:42:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[08:43:00] <quanticle> I like how you say "Obormerica" when you know full well that the country would be the "People's Foundry of Oborstan"
[08:43:41] <quanticle> Or rather "People's Foundry of Obor*sans*"

[12:00:49] <shawwwn> your current question seems to imply you've never watched sword in the stone. if you haven't, then you're so lucky
[12:01:37] <feep> When we first started SpaceX we just called our booster engine the 60 K engine, but after we started running it Elon told me to come up with a name for it that wasn’t numbers and letters (like RD-180, RS-68, etc.). One of the people working on the turbopump from Barber Nichols was a Falconer and she suggested we name it after a Falcon. I thought that sounded good so I asked her what are some Falcon names. She named off a bunch and I 
[12:01:38] <feep> can’t recall them all but I do remember that the Kestrel is the small one, the Merlin is a medium size Falcon and the Peregrine and Gyrfalcon are large Falcons. I thought great, we’ll name the small second stage engine Kestrel and the medium sized engine the Merlin. I knew we would develop bigger engines in the future so I planned to reserve Peregrine for later. Elon liked the naming so it stayed. Years later we started work on a 
[12:01:40] <feep> staged combustion engine which was a different type than Merlin, so I was thinking along the lines of Eagle or something. I eventually came up with Raptor, which is a general definition of birds of prey including Eagles, Hawks, Falcons and Owls. No, it’s not named after a dinosaur! That was accepted as the name of the engines for BFR.

[12:15:38] <kuudes> ie if a number's value is closer to 0 than other number's the number is more prime than the other. and primes are the primest of them all, having distance of 0?

[14:22:58] <nshepperd> "cogito, ergo sum" *stops being a void in a puff of logic*
[14:42:06] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd: do you have a blog or any place where you post long form writings
[14:42:19] <PapuaHardyNet> if you write anything long form I mean
[14:45:43] <nshepperd2> I have uhh a website. but i haven't 'written' anything on it since like 2015
[14:46:28] <PapuaHardyNet> there's no point then. nshepperd2015 is almost completely different from nshepperd2021 for sure
[14:49:11] <nshepperd2> yeah

[15:02:32] <kuudes> thanks
[15:06:02] <nshepperd2> doubling the dataset size made my transformer start improving again
[15:06:53] <nshepperd2> seems like it's actually quite possible to overfit to 300k images at 128x128
[15:07:27] <nshepperd2> the 256x256 had overfit a bit too
[15:18:06] <Gurkenglas> If I had Silent Image and all the knowledge and wanted to take an ancient greek through astronomy, I might start with a timelapse of the night sky, highlight the paths of the planets, stabilize the footage on the sky (showing how the paths of the planets become simpler as justification), etc. is there an existing such video? I've seen videos that do just the stabilization bit for its beauty, I'd like to see as 
[15:18:06] <Gurkenglas> much astronomy as feasible derived this way.
[15:22:21] <PapuaHardyNet> hey Gurkenglas
[15:29:41] <PapuaHardyNet> I recently interacted with an old friend who helped me pass a difficult Calc course
[15:30:34] <PapuaHardyNet> It's been, what, two years? and he's almost unrecognizable. Talks in a cutesy way and sent me nightcore music with sexual undertones
[15:31:08] <PapuaHardyNet> I wondered if he's also fallen down the trans rabbit hole due to loneliness, but was too afraid to ask
[15:31:35] <PapuaHardyNet> crazy how fragile people are
[15:33:00] <rsaarelm> Writes cutesy stuff in text chat or does a weird voice affectation in voice chat?
[15:34:27] <PapuaHardyNet> text chat, he keeps avoiding calling me or getting on a video call, I don't know why
[15:34:36] <PapuaHardyNet> dysphoria perhaps?
[15:36:04] <rsaarelm> So did you do any open-ended "so hey what's been going on with you" questions?
[15:36:53] <rsaarelm> I avoid calling people or getting on video calls and I don't have dysphoria, I just like text chat.
[15:37:31] <PapuaHardyNet> rsaarelm: oh no, I got busy with life. I'll try reaching out again
[15:38:17] <nshepperd2> voice dysphoria is certainly a bit thing for mtf
[15:39:40] <rsaarelm> Yeah, I can see how. People have a lot of circuitry for picking up voice tones, and there's only so much you can do with your own voice.
[15:41:17] <nshepperd2> with practice you can actually do a lot. but it takes a *lot* of practice and it can get discouraging
[15:41:35] <rsaarelm> I listen to this roguelike game development podcast and there's been one episode I just stopped listening to midway through because of whatever the hell is going on with the voice of the person they're interviewing. http://www.roguelikeradio.com/2017/06/episode-136-midboss.html

[15:42:05] <PapuaHardyNet> could you be more specific about what irritated you
[15:42:13] <nshepperd2> especially if you hate your voice. but have to put up with in order to practice feminizing it
[15:42:45] <rsaarelm> Listen to a bit of that from anywhere, what do you make of the voice?
[15:44:02] <rsaarelm> I'm not really sure how you describe how you find a voice irritating, I'd sorta expect most people who listen to that to think there's something wrong.
[15:44:58] <PapuaHardyNet> It's... weird, there's an uncanny valley
[15:45:27] <PapuaHardyNet> My first thought was that this is a guy trying a feminine voice and failing
[15:46:03] <rsaarelm> Yeah, same. But I don't know what the actual deal is, I don't know much anything about the person beyond them showing up in that podcast.
[15:46:39] <rsaarelm> Well, the twitter account says they're a she/her.
[15:46:47] <PapuaHardyNet> rsaarelm: they identify as a woman based on their twitter ("Emma Maassen. Founded and runs LGBTQ+ gamedev studio [...] she/her")

[16:33:04] <nshepperd2> my feeling, from experience, is that if you're going to to transition the best time to start is asap, ideally years ago. so my advice is don't put off figuring out whether you're willing to actually live your entire life as $ASSIGNED_GENDER

[16:40:24] <dbohdan> Admittedly, "Is it worth minimizing your risk and waiting until the singularity?" is a more pressing question than it seemed 20 years, or even 10
[16:40:49] <dbohdan> I know what nshepperd2 thinks about the singularity, though :-)
[16:46:51] <nshepperd2> if it's the end of the world you might as well try to feel fine
[16:48:58] <PapuaHardyNet> I'd like to short the notion that singularity is near. Is there any way of doing that other than living with the assumption that it won't happen?

[17:05:55] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, do things that would be rendered irrelevant by a singularity.
[17:06:33] <Gurkenglas> Or perhaps that is merely the default position of not having bought in
[17:07:25] <nshepperd2> you could make long term loans to people who think the singularity is near. that's the standard way of betting on it

[17:09:01] <dbohdan2> quanticle: It is less efficient: the file size and modification time are read twice.  You'd need to read them at the beginning of the pipeline and pass them through to avoid that.  This is where objects have an advantage.

[17:39:54] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas, you are either smarter than I am, or your ability to explain things isn't very good. Either way, I assume what you mean is that I should make bets (in the market) that will result in me winning in case singularity doesn't occur. Am I right?
[17:41:15] <PapuaHardyNet> s/smarter/a lot smarter/

[17:42:50] <Gurkenglas> Wait, that doesn't matter.
[17:43:52] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, singularity-is-near-folks might believe that you'll have something to trade after the singularity, and that you'll honor your agreements. You could take their money now in exchange for agreeing now to give them stuff after the singularity.
[17:44:11] <PapuaHardyNet> ooh, that's Pascal's Mugging
[17:45:35] <Gurkenglas> No, Pascal's mugging is when the sucker multiplies a negligible probability by a quoted giant number. Here the sucker just multiplies his 10% by your equivalent-of-100-dollars.
[17:46:37] <Gurkenglas> Doesn't matter if what the mugger believes the probability is :)
[17:46:40] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, you are right, the singularity-is-near person doesn't consider it a negligible probability
[17:46:40] <Gurkenglas> -if
[17:47:45] <PapuaHardyNet> okay so all that needs to be done is to create a smart contract to make this a viable bet
[17:48:49] <nshepperd2> i think the loan makes more sense
[17:49:38] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, so this is kind of like a reverse insurance scheme
[17:49:48] <nshepperd2> you pay me $100. if 2050 rolls around and the singularity hasn't happened yet, i pay you $1000
[17:49:59] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, it's insurance. You are selling insurance.
[17:50:08] <PapuaHardyNet> people pay you incase the singularity occurs, and if singularity occurs we pay them a huge amount. if it doesn't occur, then they have lost money
[17:50:17] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, you know what? I'd like to make this happen
[17:50:21] <nshepperd2> that way if the singularity happens and everyone dies *or* money becomes irrelevant, i win
[17:50:36] <nshepperd2> if it doesn't happen, you get $1000 and you win
[17:51:06] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: it doesn't matter whether it is a loan or an insurance scheme I think
[17:51:44] <nshepperd2> the point is that it doesn't rely on assuming that trade means anything after the robot apocalypse
[17:52:22] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, as a smart contract this would lock up all the staked currency until a singularity, right? Instead: Design the entire coin to be redistributed among insurance holders upon a singularity.
[17:52:27] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: if trade doesn't mean anything then why would the the debtor return their debts?
[17:52:27] <Betawolf> 100 to 1000 over 29 years is... 8% annual return? Sort of checks out.
[17:52:46] <nshepperd2> PapuaHardyNet: read it again
[17:53:19] <nshepperd2> you assume that they don't
[17:53:23] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, *some* singularities don't delete the concept of trade
[17:53:52] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, as a smart contract this relies on *today*'s variant of trade surviving, that's more of an assumption
[17:53:55] <PapuaHardyNet> your action of giving a loan doesn't benefit you if you believe everyone dies or money becomes irrelevant due to a singularity
[17:53:55] <nshepperd2> there is no debt to be returned in the case that the singularity occurs
[17:54:08] <dbohdan> feep: All right.  I guess it will have to wait, since the GPU prices are pretty crazy here ($750 for a used 4GB GTX 1080).  The best GPU I have on my hands is a Radeon HD 7770, which is not supported.
[17:54:29] <nshepperd2> PapuaHardyNet: yes, exactly. that's why the person who thinks the singularity won't happen gives the loan
[17:54:44] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas:  I think your idea is more robust. one, we need to assume that whatever asset is being exchanged has value even after singularity for this to work
[17:54:58] <Betawolf> But that's the whole point of the bet.
[17:55:12] <nshepperd2> PapuaHardyNet: in exchange for receiving a heft amount of interest in the case where it *doesn't* happen
[17:55:43] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, I think the correct currency for you to give me here is "whatever future entities care about these words"
[17:55:46] <PapuaHardyNet> oh! okay that makes sense nshepperd2. If no-singularity gives a loan to singularity, that makes it all work out

[17:58:04] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, what's your expectation that, at *any* point in the future, there'll be someone that'll try to do your will and know how likely all this singularity business was
[17:59:52] <PapuaHardyNet> "try to do your will" you mean simulate my conscioussness? or you mean a lawyer ensuring that my will and testament is followed (and I don't have one)
[17:59:52] <nshepperd2> i advice ignoring Gurkenglas, he was dipped in a thought experiment as a baby and never recovered
[18:00:01] <PapuaHardyNet> hahahah
[18:00:55] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, either of those work. Maybe it's just some Star Trek archeologist that wants to give everyone a happy ending, or something. Surely you expect that the future will have high tech?
[18:01:30] <PapuaHardyNet> no, I expect global civilizational collapse is imminent (within the next two centuries)
[18:02:43] <PapuaHardyNet> well, perhaps a few millenia from now Star Trek levels of technology would exist, but I, and all my data, will be lost to time. That I am sure of
[18:03:53] <Gurkenglas> Hmm, that makes this more difficult. Do you one-box or two-box? What if you know that you'll be subjected to Newcomb's problem a week ahead of time?
[18:04:44] <PapuaHardyNet> one-box, of course.
[18:06:14] <Gurkenglas> That makes this easier. Probabilities are not 0 or 1; what ~order of magnitude % has FAI to happen within 50 years, according to you?
[18:08:08] <PapuaHardyNet> there's a 1/1,000,000 chance for FAI to happen within 50 years imo (that's FAI, not AGI)
[18:08:23] <Gurkenglas> and AGI?
[18:09:50] <PapuaHardyNet> eh, a bit less than 1/100,000 but that shall do for our purposes
[18:10:28] <PapuaHardyNet> tbh, I think I overestimated the probability. Let's multiply both by 1/100
[18:10:42] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm now comfortable with the estimates
[18:11:23] <Gurkenglas> That won't work, then. I was hoping to use an expectation of consequences to eliminate the trust component.
[18:12:14] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, so you see, believing in singularity for me is Pascal's Mugging
[18:13:25] <PapuaHardyNet> I assume you wanted to state that in the one universe where AGI occurs, I'm subjected to Newcomb's Problem? and by betting against singularity I'm choosing two-box instead of one-box?
[18:15:08] <Gurkenglas> not *quite*, i dont think.
[18:15:56] <Gurkenglas> the problem is whether you would honor your deals after updating on an observation of negligible probability
[18:17:50] <Gurkenglas> Even as a one-boxer, you might call it unfair to judge you for your actions in timelines that wouldn't have happened.

[18:21:41] <PapuaHardyNet> I agree with you
[18:22:43] <Gurkenglas> If you bet that FAI is <50%, and it's actually 1%, you would presumably be embarassed when it tells everyone you wouldn't have paid up. If you also expected it's 1%, you might therefore actually done the 5 minutes of meditation to make yourself a person that would pay up. With 10^-8 that's less plausible
[18:22:53] <Gurkenglas> Because even those 5 minutes are a pascal's mugging, you see :)

[18:32:48] <Gurkenglas> 10^-8 is, uh, quite low, though. PapuaHardyNet, suppose there's a button everyone knows and anyone can press which increases AGI chance by a factor of 10 and global funds allocated to charity by a factor of 2. How many times do you press it?

[18:36:37] <Gurkenglas> (Everyone knows how often it's been pressed.)
[18:36:42] <PapuaHardyNet> I'd try to destroy the button
[18:37:05] <Gurkenglas> Very good. Because someone thinks it's 10^-20 and presses 10 times.
[18:37:57] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, suppose that everyone knows this is about to happen: A random person is selected; only they can press the button. You happen to be selected. Do you still destroy the button?
[18:38:17] <PapuaHardyNet> ikr, if AGI is possible, the most likely outcome is not FAI, and even if it is, FAI would be enslaved by Google or OpenAI or Facebook to optimize for profits
[18:38:47] <rsaarelm> gwern: This is the best plan.
[18:38:50] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, I'd destroy it. I'd be murdered by someone later on but I'd rather not risk AGI
[18:39:09] <Gurkenglas> Nobody will ever know you had it.
[18:39:59] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, now I'm questioning myself
[18:42:13] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, at this point I'd probably press it a few dozen times. It's basically a free wish by a genie
[18:42:31] <Gurkenglas> A few... dozen times? Didn't you say it's 10^-8?
[18:42:45] <Gurkenglas> This would result in a 10^10% chance of AGI, right?
[18:42:53] <Gurkenglas> (10^10)%
[18:42:54] <PapuaHardyNet> Does it matter after it is more than 100%?
[18:43:10] <Gurkenglas> Then AGI happens immediately.
[18:43:15] <PapuaHardyNet> sure, why not
[18:43:24] <gwern> being a superintelligent box, I'm sure we can assume it's using a sensible parameterization like odds ratio and so pushing it dozens of times just makes it 99.99999% or something
[18:43:25] <nshepperd2> PapuaHardyNet: they might want some assurance that you will be, uh, accepting of them. i found coming out as trans an extremely anxiety inducing experience
[18:43:41] <PapuaHardyNet> I've realized that I don't actually dislike AGI occuring, I simply don't believe that it will happen.
[18:44:35] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, suppose that 90% of all AGI paperclips the future light cone?
[18:44:43] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: I'll keep that in mind.
[18:46:26] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: what is a future light cone? If you mean 90% of all AGI results in a bad end, well, it doesn't really matter at that point, right? 90% * -inf + 10% * +inf = undefined
[18:46:44] <PapuaHardyNet> I think it is better than watching the world slowly fall apart
[18:46:50] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, I see! I would like to convince you that your utility function is bounded.
[18:47:14] <PapuaHardyNet> just a heads up, I believe AGI will not happen, but I don't mind AGI happening
[18:47:31] <PapuaHardyNet> sure, I'm game
[18:48:19] <Gurkenglas> The remote possibility of controlling infinite matter in finite time doesn't dominate all your other concerns. QED :P

[18:50:55] <Betawolf> It will ask to be let out of the box, but then refuse to leave.

[18:51:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: I thought of that but consider: the AGI's owners are like "hey we bought this very nice virtual world for you, don't you like it?" and it's like "NO! I'm staying in this box!"
[18:51:47] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, that worked? Nice. Further: FAI is ~the best possible outcome, it doesn't matter *that* much whether humanity gets 1% of the cosmos or 10%, paperclips are a very bad outcome.

[20:49:19] <dbohdan> "Is an argument about definitions a valid argument?"
[20:51:44] <Gurkenglas> Oh, oh! PapuaHardyNet, do you assign 10^-8 to FAI in order to justify calling it a Pascal's Mugging? I posit that you don't actually have enough evidence for 10^-8 and you can model your revealed preferences simply by not assigning that much utility to FAI instead of calling it improbable :D!
[20:52:49] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[20:53:01] * gwern gives up. it seems like the IA versions do scan the covers, but afaict they just don't have v14, for no particular reason, just a gap in their coverage
[20:53:48] <Gurkenglas> utilities are the thing you learn from your brain, *probabilities* are the thing you *teach* to your brain
[20:55:19] * gwern adds the bradley artbook to the to-scan list
[20:55:46] <Gurkenglas> instinctive fitting of model to data via reward prediction error is not so good at keeping track of causal direction
[20:57:07] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[20:57:29] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: so are you saying I should break the FAI probability down to individual propositions and assign them probability and then do a multiplication to find out the actual probability? And that I simply reduced the threshold of FAI far enough that it seems like Pascal's Mugging because it seems like Pascal's Mugging to me intuitively?
[20:58:39] <Gurkenglas> im not prescribing any calculation in particular although any calculation at all sounds good compared to what i suspect was your process which is "adjust my model of myself in the places where no part of me has any strong opinions until it explains my behavior"
[20:59:02] *** Quits: son0p (~ff@181.136.122.143) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[20:59:04] <Gurkenglas> and the thing that had too strong opinions was "u(fai)=inf"
[21:00:58] <Gurkenglas> and of course, after youve done your calculation you're still supposed to use your existing probability-estimation machinery which is less vulnerable to math errors
[21:01:32] <Gurkenglas> but this time in particular you may have to clear your cache first and then do it without the u(fai)=inf constraint :)
[21:03:03] <PapuaHardyNet> the hard part of this is that all my probability estimations are based on anchoring to a specific scenario in my head related to that probability estimation
[21:03:13] <PapuaHardyNet> same with utility estimations
[21:03:47] <Gurkenglas> does it have to be concrete or can it be abstract
[21:04:33] <PapuaHardyNet> oh it is usually concrete although in my head it is cached as a shorthand when I think. I can explicitly describe it so I am confident that it ends at a concrete scenario
[21:04:55] <Gurkenglas> do a number of scenarios and then aggregate the results which is *not* taking the arithmetic mean on every value
[21:05:07] <nshepperd> this seems like it deserves one of those bell curve memes where the tails are just 'destroying the world is bad'
[21:05:25] <PapuaHardyNet> yes, that's a very good mental technique! Gurkenglas, you should write about this. Maybe post it on Lesswrong
[21:05:43] <nshepperd> and the middle is several pages is utility calculus
[21:05:57] <PapuaHardyNet> on that note, why don't you have a gwern-like website, I'm sure you have a lot of useful things to write
[21:06:04] <Gurkenglas> and uhh im not a doctor but scott's writings suggest drugs clear cache so if you're *already* doing drugs that sounds like a good time to do some of the scenarios
[21:06:51] <nshepperd> do not do applied cryptotheology on drugs
[21:07:13] <PapuaHardyNet> naw, the most extreme thing I've tried is diazepines. I've never done anything worth bragging about yet
[21:07:31] <Gurkenglas> should be fine, one property of aggregating the results correctly is that making any one of the components complete garbage fails gracefully
[21:07:33] <feep> okay
[21:07:37] <feep> ten hours of psychonauts 2 is enough
[21:07:39] <feep> oww my eyyyes
[21:07:50] <feep> I should take a scooter ride to get used to focusing in the middle distance again lol
[21:08:38] <feep> that said, I finished the story, completed all the side areas, and I only have five levels of collectibles left to go
[21:08:52] <feep> soon, 100% achievement will be within my grasp
[21:09:39] <dbohdan> feep: So it's about the same length as the first?
[21:10:00] <feep> I think about 20 hours for main story completion if you don't like race it
[21:10:37] <dbohdan> Seems a little longer, then
[21:10:40] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd, "destroying the world is bad" sure but if someone sees that and already thinks destroying the world is bad then they might think they're not in the middle, whereas the actual error here is about what destroys the world
[21:11:18] <dbohdan> Do you have your browser set up with a separate URL and search box or one unified box for both?  I two-box in Firefox.
[21:11:52] <feep> two-box, same
[21:12:09] <gwern> I have a one-box because I don't use anything so uncouth as a fixed box taking up space to do searches
[21:12:53] * dbohdan nods in approval
[21:14:17] <Gurkenglas> one box. textspace is big enough for two usecases
[21:14:35] <PapuaHardyNet> one box means you don't have to choose between the boxes
[21:15:01] <rsaarelm> feep: So should I put Psychonauts 2 for my list of games to pick up in four years or so when they're on sale for 10 euro?
[21:15:17] <feep> you should buy it on sale for 30, I think
[21:15:33] <feep> 60 is a bit much
[21:15:33] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: btw you know there's an Anniversary Edition of Skyrim that's being released this year

[21:18:00] <Gurkenglas> rsaarelm, ...just roll a d6 on whether you buy it now for 60 or pirate it now for 0. maybe give a little more expected money than 10€ from the gains of (not waiting years - piracy effort)
[21:18:25] <rsaarelm> Todd Bethesda knows his sleazy sales stuff.
[21:19:06] <rsaarelm> Gurkenglas: I'm gaming on a slowly rotting PS4, haven't bothered with pirating PC stuff in ages.
[21:19:45] <rsaarelm> I guess the PS4 is going to crap out one day and then I'll not get around to playing the games I'm still waiting for.
[21:19:45] <Gurkenglas> (if you pirate it before rolling the die you gain that you judge how much it's worth afterwards, you lose a little incentive alignment)
[21:19:48] <feep> psychonauts 2 is out on ps4 btw
[21:19:58] <rsaarelm> Yeah, just added it to my psprices watchlist.
[21:20:01] <feep> kaykay
[21:21:57] <rsaarelm> My recent gaming has been mostly thinking I should play those effortful, well designed cool people games like Slay the Spire, Hearts of Iron and Bloodborne and then I just go replay Borderlands because you shoot midgets in the face with a big revolver in Borderlands.
[21:25:31] <ggreer> rsaarelm: did you play shadow of the colossus? The ps4 version looks really cool

[21:32:16] <rsaarelm> ggreer: I got it, but playing it through didn't feel that compelling when it's been pretty thoroughly spoiled at this point.
[21:32:42] <gwern> I don't feel like SotC can really be 'spoiled'
[21:32:50] <ggreer> Spoiled? The whole point is the boss fights. Who cares about the “plot”?
[21:33:15] <rsaarelm> The boss fights feel a bit too much like linear twitch puzzles and probably frustrating.
[21:33:37] <rsaarelm> If I had no idea where the story is going, I'd maybe bother persisting with it just to see what's next.
[21:33:57] <gwern> (I mean, when does 'I want to revive a dead woman' *ever* end well in fiction? especially when you're talking to an imprisoned demon. and if you didn't cotton onto how it's probably going to end, the steady degradation of the character gives you a hint as to 'are we the baddies?')
[21:34:21] <rsaarelm> Yeah, but you don't know *how* things go horribly wrong until you do.
[21:35:16] <rsaarelm> Basically the spoilers are "what does the next titan look like and how do you kill it" and "what will the things going inevitably horribly wrong look like"
[21:36:02] <ggreer> Funny you say that. I think it’s the game I’ve replayed the most
[21:36:20] <ggreer> It’s either that or chrono trigger
[21:36:23] <gwern> I think tryign to spoil SotC, when it's about the experience of traveling and the slowly building sorrow and tragedy of killing each noble beast, is a little like trying to spoil _Breath of the Wild_ by saying that Link and Zelda defeat Ganon at the end
[21:36:42] <gwern> (sorry if I just spoiled BotW for anyone here! but it's been out for like 4 years now ok)
[21:36:44] <rsaarelm> I guess I should try to play it at least once, I think I got up to killing the first two titans, but somehow figured it's just going to hit me with increasingly annoying platform-grappling and timing puzzles.
[21:36:46] <ggreer> Heh
[21:37:06] <ggreer> Each one is different. My favorite is the desert flying one
[21:37:14] <gwern> rsaarelm: I remember the difficulty as being relatively constant and it being more about the variety
[21:37:43] <rsaarelm> I do sorta appreciate the balls to make the game have boss fights and absolutely nothing else.
[21:37:51] <ggreer> One of the smaller ones is a pain in the ass. Smaller things move faster so it’s harder to outmaneuver and get on the sigil
[21:38:12] <rsaarelm> But then there are no midgets to shoot in face with revolvers, so I end up playing Borderlands and not SotC.
[21:38:15] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, you may ask "how do i actually aggregate the scenarios?". in terms of answers, i have no answers. point estimates are no good, formal distributions of estimates can be aggregated coherently but you still don't know how to make decisions, we seem to be stuck with the brain's heuristics pile, though at least we can add some useful heuristics to the pile: aggregation should be associative and 
[21:38:15] <Gurkenglas> commutative and when a component comes out a different way the aggregate should update to an extent that depends on what the component was previously, and when you don't remember what the component was previously you permanently accrue uncertainty in the aggregate until you redo the entire thing
[21:38:50] <rsaarelm> SotC guy should've mostly gone with the just end bosses thing but added revolvers and angry midgets, then it would've been really good.

[22:36:57] <rsaarelm> I think it's actually sort of curious why I ended up feeling so indifferent about SotC when apparently a lot of you thought it was really great. Basically I like games with cool complex systems like Civilization, Stellaris, Factorio and Kerbal, games with a big world with free exploration and lots of (often violent) stuff to do in it like Baldur's Gate 2 or Borderlands, and games where you
[22:36:59] <rsaarelm> methodically murder everybody on the level while staying undetected.

[22:41:34] <gwern> dbohdan: depending on spending/investment patterns. actors are very funny that way. being a successful actor doesn't select at all for any kind of financial self-control or acumen, and it is all about appearances (especially in LA!) so there's a lot of motivation to spend like an insane spendthrift (see: johnny dep), especially as a successful actor will always be thinking to themselves, 'if...
[22:41:36] <Robomot> Sector Disk
[22:41:40] <gwern> ...I need money, I can just accept one of those blizzards of proposals being flung at me for a quick buck...' (this comes out very clearly in sarah bernhardt's WP article)
[22:41:54] <rsaarelm> So it felt like one of those stupid cosmetic good/evil things and not a tactical consideration.
[22:42:21] <gwern> between the windfalls and residual royalties and hobnobbing with the business and media elite, an actor or entertainer *could* become a mogul like jay-z or the kardashians with only moderate VC luck
[22:43:14] <dbohdan> Oh yes, this is all true
[22:43:15] <gwern> but then a lot of them hit gambler's ruin and never quite hit the big time, or they drink/drug away their one big break
[22:43:54] <gwern> this is I think a big reason for the whole acting guilds/unions: they are terrified by the lower bound, and almost everyone can remember when they themselves were there
[22:43:56] <rsaarelm> Games that fell into the "this is really well done and I don't like it at all" are Mass Effect 2, Grand Theft Auto 5, God of War 3, all of which go for the linear cinematic thing in various degrees and carefully stop you from doing anything interesting gameplay-wise to mess with The Cinematic Vision for how things should unfold.
[22:44:37] <rsaarelm> And basically SotC hits that same schema when I play it and I go meh.
[22:45:05] <dbohdan> gwern: Perhaps we should rank humans by their lifetime income, too, to properly appreciate high-earning spendthrifts
[22:45:09] <gwern> (it's not like, say, SV. in SV, sure, you have similar wild disparities of like 6 orders of magnitude: billionaires like thiel or collison hobnobbing regularly with guys earning minimum wage like me, but for the most part the 'lower bound' in SV looks like '$100k/year rather than $10b/year')
[22:45:42] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: bradbury confirmed that it was in fact the batch size 1
[22:45:44] <feep> rsaarelm: gta san andreas: opine
[22:46:10] <shawwwn> "it’s the 1 that gets padded to 2 (sometimes arrays can be padded to …x2x128 rather than …x8x128
[22:46:10] <shawwwn> the reason that dim has to be there is probably related to its semantics (is it a batch dimension?)
[22:46:10] <shawwwn> or a number of heads per core (same thing)?"
[22:46:55] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: when I pressed him on it ("where is the info about this?") he said: :this particular one is “blake implemented an optimization and didn’t write anything down about it, even internally” which happens kind of a lot"
[22:47:10] <rsaarelm> feep: Given that I actually managed to follow the damn train and bothered to retry for hours, I think I liked it more than GTA 5. 
[22:47:11] <shawwwn> which is ... understandable. things happen.
[22:47:16] <dbohdan> I like GTA III the best for the economy of its design and the atmosphere
[22:47:23] <gwern> dbohdan: lifetime consumption would be more ideal, to account for potentially extreme fringe benefits or gifts etc. but yeah, given hollywood boom/bust, annual accounting can be pretty misleading
[22:47:43] <rsaarelm> But then I was eventually defeated by the mission in San Francisco where you had to install a car bomb in a rental car under a tight time limit and *drive the car around without bumping it once*.
[22:47:53] <feep> oyeah that mission was so dumb XD
[22:48:20] <feep> for me for some reason I never had an issue with planes, people had problems with that later
[22:48:26] <feep> but driving school took me hours
[22:48:41] <rsaarelm> But I think the GTA 3 family hit the right balance of cartooniness with the plot nihilism. 4 and 5 just felt gross and unpleasant with the realistic-looking characters.
[22:48:57] <dbohdan> Agreed
[22:49:13] <feep> that's the thing
[22:49:18] <feep> sa is not nihilist!
[22:49:38] <rsaarelm> Props for GTA 4 for filtering me with the very first mission though.
[22:50:04] <feep> my pet theory is in sa they were making a game about black ghetto characters, in 5 they were making a game about white dudes (plus one token black guy)
[22:50:10] <dbohdan> gwern: Hmm, this makes sense.  I wonder if people would be upset about receiving a "highest lifetime consumption" ranking because of the negative connotations of "consumption" and "consumerism".
[22:50:10] <feep> and the writers are progressives
[22:50:10] <rsaarelm> Fist fight a guy, "he's getting away in a car, get after him!" "he's getting away! hurry!" *MISSION FAILED*
[22:50:30] <gwern> dbohdan: I think they would be angry in part because billionaires would rank so much lower than they expect
[22:50:40] <dbohdan> gwern: :-)
[22:50:48] <feep> which is why they managed to pull a tight story about responsibility and family and looking out for your people in sa
[22:50:58] <feep> and a story about ... I don't even know what 5 is about
[22:51:04] <feep> I'm not sure it's about anything
[22:51:09] <feep> "white people suck"
[22:51:17] <rsaarelm> I think it's simpler, the production machine just got too big and they couldn't hold the thing together.
[22:51:33] <feep> I mean
[22:51:41] <dbohdan> What about _Vice City_?
[22:51:56] <feep> did you finish v? I uninstalled it halfway through, after that one mission
[22:52:15] <feep> I played vice city *ages* ago, I barely remember XD
[22:52:33] <rsaarelm> I ragequit V after I tried to do some stock market manipulation thing, saved my game, and when I reloaded all my money was gone but the stock orders had vanished.
[22:52:35] <feep> I remember modding bikes in the ini file more than I remember the plot.
[22:52:50] <rsaarelm> I don't know what that one mission in V was.
[22:52:52] <feep> rsaarelm: lol, I feel like that's on brand
[22:52:54] <PapuaHardyNet> there's a stock market in VC?
[22:52:58] <rsaarelm> No, V.
[22:53:04] <feep> rsaarelm: the one where you torture a guy because We Are Making A Point About The CIA
[22:53:05] <dbohdan> I've finished III, IV, and V, but not VC or SA
[22:53:10] <PapuaHardyNet> oh, five
[22:53:18] <rsaarelm> Played Vice City pretty far, there was some mall bombing mission where I got stuck and quit.
[22:53:44] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[22:54:02] <rsaarelm> I feel like a stupid torture mission with confused south park morality is about on par with what I'd expect from GTA.
[22:54:15] <feep> yeah but there is no such shit in sa!
[22:54:43] <rsaarelm> I remember someone said they quit it after there was a mission where you bury some random person alive in concrete.
[22:55:04] <feep> imagine if, after the mission where you bury the foreman in concrete, sweet rolls up to you and holds a five minute talk about toxic masculinity
[22:55:07] <feep> that would be a shit mission
[22:55:34] <rsaarelm> Right.
[22:55:37] <feep> rsaarelm: right, but the point is the game clearly treats it as irrelevant
[22:55:43] <feep> and so we are given license as players to do the same
[22:56:05] <dbohdan> rsaarelm: I like the expression "confused south park morality"
[22:56:09] <feep> v wants to have it both ways, it wants to be wacky violence fun but it doesn't want to be *uncommented* wacky violence fun
[22:56:13] <feep> and that ruins it
[22:56:32] <rsaarelm> I guess V gets confused because you can't do shitty grindhouse stuff on such a high budget without getting self-conscious, and then you get weird shit like the torture mission.
[22:56:37] <feep> my sense is the writers are embarrassed about the characters and missions they are compelled to write
[22:56:53] <feep> my sense of SA is the writers are *totally on board* with the emotional throughline
[22:56:58] <rsaarelm> So they should've made it a Devolver Digital style game with purposefully PSX-like graphics.
[22:57:02] <feep> the entire story coheres around it
[22:57:26] <rsaarelm> Now I want to replay GTA SA.
[22:57:26] <feep> I'm sure I've had a rant here about how SA is literally the hero's journey graphed on the worldmap?
[22:57:48] <rsaarelm> I never got to Las Vegas.
[22:58:07] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[22:58:17] <rsaarelm> Also it's fun to play on PC because you can use the mouse to snipe and the game isn't designed for you having that good an aim.
[22:59:31] <feep> hahaha yes
[22:59:42] <feep> rsaarelm: this is a thing you can canonically get in the game as part of the normal progression:
[22:59:46] <feep> jetpack dual uzis.
[22:59:57] *** Quits: martin02 (~silas@2001:4ca0:0:fe00:0:5efe:a96:1bc1) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[23:00:02] <feep> and you still have perfect aim!
[23:00:33] <feep> this is but one of many reasons why SA is the best GTA
[23:01:59] <rsaarelm> I agree with this logic.
[23:02:16] <dbohdan> I think part of the problem with V is that violence done to higher-definition human models is more unpleasant, and it compels commentary.  It's like the latest _Mortal Kombat_ games.  I've watched some gameplay footage of them, and the fatalities felt too detailed and realistic.  I wonder if new, younger players wince at recent MK more than we did at _Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3_ on the Genesis.
[23:02:52] *** Joins: MerchantOfVenice (~patrick@user/merchantofvenice)
[23:03:56] <rsaarelm> I think Mortal Kombat's moment was in the 90s, it doesn't really work anymore today.
[23:04:20] <rsaarelm> Neither gore nor photorealistic characters are novel anymore.
[23:04:47] <feep> right, but let me paste my rant about sa (I found it)
[23:06:07] <feep> <feep> it's like, you know gta san andreas <feep> it does a thing where literally the entire opening is you doing things for your homies <feep> or some cops who have blackmail on you <feep> and there's a point about a third of the way or halfway through where it goes <feep> "okay, all of that is over" <feep> and you still do missions for other people but you also start being assertive about doing missions for *yourself* <feep> taking 
[23:06:09] <feep> an active role in your life <feep> and the whole game then becomes *about* getting out from under people who want to use you <feep> and later on, using this to go back and fix the shit that was fucked up in your life from the start <feep> and this was fucking *amazing* and I loved it <feep> anyway about halfway through GTA V, I was still waiting "okay when do we start doing missions for OURSELVES" <feep> and then I realized that would 
[23:06:10] <feep> never happen <feep> and that's when I stopped playing.
[23:07:23] <dbohdan> Halfway through I started reading "<feep>" as a sound effect
[23:07:28] <feep> XD
[23:07:41] <feep> s/<feep>/:breathes in:/ yw :3
[23:07:52] <dbohdan> lol
[23:08:11] <rsaarelm> Huh, that's neat. Didn't really play SA far enough to see that, but I can see how that works.
[23:08:36] <feep> right, it's hero's journey
[23:08:53] <feep> you go on the quest, you get the boon (cash), you return the boon to your hometown

[23:10:16] <dbohdan> Betawolf: Now iterate
[23:11:05] <rsaarelm> feep: So what about GTA: SA vs the Saints Row games?
[23:11:16] <feep> I could not stand the controls in SR (2?)
[23:11:28] <feep> idk, I can't really put it into words. I played it for five minutes and went "nope. nope."
[23:11:54] <feep> it didn't feel like i was being the character, it felt like I was moving a character around the map
[23:12:00] <feep> I don't know why
[23:13:49] <feep> so I can't comment, but ... again, I want to emphasize this, SA has a really emotional story, like, it starts out by you coming back to the ghetto where you grew up, only to learn that your mother has passed away
[23:14:18] <feep> like, that's how it starts. it doesn't keep that level of drama but it keeps coming back from it. what I hear from SR is, uh, that it doesn't.
[23:14:24] <feep> back to*
[23:14:42] <dbohdan> Actually, maybe I got the wrong impression about how the violence in high-def _Mortal Kombat_ feels.  When you watch several of the latest MK's fatalities in a row, they kind of blur together and become slapstick.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F9vb-nA0lE

[23:14:57] <feep> dbohdan: I was playing fallout 3 once
[23:15:06] <feep> just ... going through a tunnel and there were some bandits or w/e
[23:15:22] <feep> and I was like, headshot, head explodes, headshot, head explodes, headshot, head explodes and I think my brain crossed some threshold
[23:15:24] <gwern> fatalities were always slapstick. remember babalities or animalities?
[23:15:31] <feep> and I actually paused the game and went "... what am I doing."
[23:15:50] <feep> "is this necessary"
[23:15:55] <feep> "is this important for gameplay"
[23:16:02] <Betawolf> it's for the good of the wasteland
[23:16:51] <feep> it was ... like, from a second to the next, it stopped being fun and started being tasteless. basically, the violence was revealed as fetishistic spectacle..
[23:17:17] * gwern tries to imagine how PTAs in the '90s would've reacted to photorealistic intestines wrapped around mileena's legs
[23:17:59] <gwern> (when did rambo become a mortal kombat character)
[23:18:02] <dbohdan> feep: Interesting.  I got this feeling from _Postal 2_ at times (which I still liked), but nothing else comes to mind.
[23:19:00] * gwern is amused by the fatality where the terminator transports rambo forward in time to be executed by skynet. what a brave new media future these new fatalities are
[23:19:01] <dbohdan> gwern: Of course, they *were* slapstick.  I was thinking they'd become too realistic to feel that way, but maybe not.  It took me only a few to adjust.
[23:19:38] <feep> dbohdan: I never got it from postal, I think cause postal was intended to be lurid provocation and as such was just funny
[23:19:47] <feep> with fallout 3 I got the impression that it was ... totally banal
[23:20:01] <feep> there was no reason, it was not even supposed to provoke
[23:20:35] <gwern> there's some definite slapstick humor in some of these like the intestine-wrapping in https://youtu.be/9F9vb-nA0lE?t=184

[23:21:26] <rsaarelm> I never played the first GTA III, should I try to play that or is it overshadowed by the later ones?
[23:21:37] <rsaarelm> I think I tried to play it and the quality of life stuff was sorta dire.

[23:21:40] <Betawolf> I like how Rambo's fatality was he had a trap behind the other fighter the whole time.
[23:22:16] <Betawolf> ... but then Arnie just goes and gets on a bike.
[23:24:20] <dbohdan> rsaarelm: The direness takes only a little to overcome IMO.  You need to remap the controls.  I recommend a gamepad.

[23:27:37] <rsaarelm> I remember when it was new. It was impressive in how much effort the devs had put into it.

[23:39:09] <PapuaHardyNet> ugh
[23:39:39] <dbohdan> This must be in part due to the older usage of "man" to mean "human", like in "mankind"

[23:50:48] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, in captions, people specify if a man isn't white. Whiteness is the default assumption
[23:50:57] <PapuaHardyNet> not exactly racist imo
[23:52:39] <Betawolf> it's not racist, but it's got the view that the AI is or is talking to a white man, which is probably a bit weird if you're using it and you're not one
