[02:07:28] <sukhman> @divoid yes you are right
[02:07:33] <sukhman> then which file system i need to use
[02:07:45] <MrElendig> .T*
[02:07:48] <divoid> you need to reformat it as exfat if you want to use the USB on other (windows) computers or ext4
[02:08:00] <MrElendig> sukhman: tar can split archives, but why do you have to use fat32?
[02:08:15] <MrElendig> most things these days will read exfat just fine
[02:08:52] <divoid> the pendrive probably already came with FAT32
[02:09:12] <sukhman> no i think i did it long ago

[06:12:53] <demonicmaniac> the idea of using the target nick at the beginning is simply for high volumes channels to easier skip/ignore a message
[06:13:09] <alschaapman> In a persistent fashion, as far as I can tell...? Seems like that might not be ideal in certain circumstances but it's a very handy tool nonetheless
[06:13:11] <ionface> yeah, that serverfault.com link is where the rest of the steps are
[06:13:13] <alschaapman> And anyway works fine for me here
[06:13:17] <demonicmaniac> while highlighting with just the nick works fine in any client no matter @ or : simply having the nick first makes it easier to discard messages
[06:14:09] <alschaapman> So what you're saying is there actually is a technical reason why it's good etiquette to not use @ before mentioning a nick when pinging.
[06:14:45] <demonicmaniac> no just appending the nick but have it first, @ or : is just convention

[12:44:44] <r3boot> wyre: the FHS talks about purpose, so depending on whats on there you should be able to pick a nice mountpoint. If this is for data tho, there are other things that come into play. For NFS for instance, the mountpoint becomes part of the nfs uri, which is why I would mount it under, say, /data or /movies or so; This allows you to have urls like storage:/data for nfs shares)
[12:45:51] <r3boot> but above all, the fhs is not holy, and all unices that ever existed have/had exceptions to the rule :)

[13:12:40] <Namarrgon> i said that you _can_ use it everywhere, not that you should/must use it everywhere
[13:12:56] <Namarrgon> there is no guideline, just preference
[13:12:59] <Lartza> Yeah feel free to use btrfs everywhere but it's far more experimental and unstable :P
[13:13:10] <Lartza> And MBR is ancient technology, why would you not use GPT

[13:19:43] <r3boot> If you are looking at btrfs, be sure to also checkout zfs, which is more mature, but has (possible) licensing issues

[17:47:21] <jonathon> h4rd3n3D_: while chasing down another issue that exhibited with 5.12 i ran `perf top` and found an acpi-related worker running away. that led to https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/242013/disable-gpe-acpi-interrupts-on-boot , so that might be worth checking as there are mentions of in other threads about freezes/locks. i'm testing a kernel parameter `acpi_mask_gpe=0x03` (to match the interrupt on my laptop) and will see how it goes.

[18:16:17] <roxlu> Hi, this is probably a long shot but maybe someone know this. I'm using the ALSA api to read midi data. I'm reading in a separate thread using blocking mode. Now I want my application to be able to stop the read-thread but because the `snd_rawmidi_read()` blocks the thread loop won't exit. Normally, when using sockets for example, closing the socket will trigger a `read()` to return with an
[18:16:18] <roxlu> error. Does someone knows what a similar approach with ALSA and midi is?

[21:12:42] <thrice> it's a mistake if you think arch is "minimal" - providing packages means the distro needs to comprimise to support a lot of users, and that often implies adding dependencies that *most* will find useful, for example

[21:14:14] <Vamp898> If GNOME developers think its important enough to advertise it as a main feature and shows it on every screenshot and it is built into the GNOME-Shell, it think its basic functionality.

[23:04:46] <Edu4rdSHL> eschwartz, last time I had a "Protocol not supported" was because I was trying to use a program that required a kernel module to load before using it, the kernel was not loaded before so the protocol was unrecognized.
[23:06:02] <Edu4rdSHL> Also happened when building some images with mkosi and then I started getting "Filesystem not supported: ext4" or "unkonown filesystem type: ext4" and was for the same reason.
