[00:22:49] <andr01d> jaybe, I don't think that article is actually true. This statement: "...your webmail, your spam filtering, and almost certainly your general security will not be as good as they have." If you consider that all those "free" email services are paid for by the host reading every one of your email messages, I'd say big tech email is one of the most insecure things you can do on the internet...
[00:23:45] <andr01d> Your basically CCing M$ or goggle on every message...

[01:03:16] <Khepra> are you conflating security with privacy?
[01:04:01] <Khepra> you can't beat their security. that's one of the problems I'm having lately, implementing 2FA for IMAP and webmail. too much work, I'm tired, I want the clients to go to gsuite or microsoft
[01:04:39] <Khepra> I don't have AIs recognizing suspicious activity on logins. I have brute force protectors and statistics based monitoring and alarms which is terrible.
[01:05:48] <Khepra> that article is very much spot on. mail has become too much work and dumb clients don't take "there's never guarantee for email delivery" for an answer and blame you.

[17:14:00] <tuxick> haha
[17:14:40] <tuxick> there's 3 cases if 'disappearing mails' i know of
[17:14:48] <tuxick> gmail, outlook and liars
[17:16:54] <tuxick> causes
[17:32:52] <Khepra> tuxick: needn't be disappearing. could be simpler cases of misconfiguration, outages, etc...
[17:34:20] <Khepra> I've had a case with some government agency mta requesting transport encryption and demanding sslv3 and not retrying plaintext when sslv3 was refused.
[17:34:59] <Khepra> the problem was that the sender never paid attention to these emails not being sent out, or flat out ignored their mta's DSN emails, doesn't matter.
[17:35:28] <Khepra> so months later I have clients complaining they're not receiving "important" email from this agency...
[17:36:28] <tuxick> sounds like the exchange 'admins' of dutch parliament
[17:36:38] <tuxick> had plenty fun with them
[17:37:36] <Khepra> and I'm really getting sick of that carp. No, I won't recompile libssl for sslv3. Just go away, go bother gsuite and outlook. email is ded.
[17:37:48] <tuxick> but yeah, forgot 4) incompetence
[17:39:09] <Khepra> and I really wonder, does gmail really accept sslv3? does this agency have problems only with our servers? does ANYONE, except centos 5 powered cpanel hosting from 20 years ago, accept email from them?
[18:14:14] <tuxick> haha i'd have to find an ancient openssl to check that
