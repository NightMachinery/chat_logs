[04:37:47] <danieldg> it's easy once you get it; until then it can be a bit strange
[04:38:21] <danieldg> some of it you just have to do the work and not use intuition until you 'get it'
[04:43:21] <sarnold> and after you've done a bunch of similar things, it'll probably click at some point and feel easy :)

[11:17:25] <sonOfRa> onelegend: the only modern cipher I'm aware of that is a feistel cipher is DES
[11:17:35] <sonOfRa> It *is* a cool concept, though, the idea is pretty great
[11:19:19] <wasamasa> yeah, same
[11:21:10] <sonOfRa> tusko: personally, I've found number theory *much* easier to understand in the context of a cryptography course than it ever was for me in a mathematics lecture. Did it in the first semester in uni, was completely lost, barely scraped by. Did a crypto course much later with a big focus on number theory, and it clicked. My lecture was based on this lecture series on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuJu8DOJLMltMt8RcX1tdBw/videos

(we did have a partner point out one though) Our web app is only semi-public. I would probably be involved if such a thing occurred, but I wouldn't be in charge of handling any payout, if we did actually pay out (I'm skeptical we would).
[21:22:20] *** Quits: Alina-malina (~Alina-mal@user/alina-malina) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[21:25:43] <TimMc> We have a bounty program that doesn't give out money, but only coupons.
[21:25:57] <TimMc> large public site
[21:26:47] <TimMc> but we get conversations that are like this: "I found this vulnerability" "We investigated and found that it's not actually a vulnerability" "OK thanks, so what bounty can I expect?"
[21:26:51] <TimMc> YOU GET NOTHING
[21:26:53] <wasamasa> lol
[21:27:32] <wasamasa> you think these people will ever understand only a few lucky are rewarded and the rest are better off finding a job with steady pay?
[21:28:01] <danieldg> TimMc: they should be happy you don't charge them for wasting your time!
[21:28:04] <TimMc> Well, they're probably trying and failing to get a job, and this is what they do in the meantime.
[21:28:07] <TimMc> danieldg: haha right
[21:28:16] <TimMc> I feel bad when we have to tell someone who made a really good report that we can give them... a coupon. Like a $150 coupon, but still.
[21:28:51] <TimMc> It turns out it's non-trivial for a business to just send money to a random person in the world, from an accounting standpoint.
[21:29:32] <TimMc> We're not actually misers, we just don't know how to give you the money (and still be in compliance)! 😢
[21:29:53] <TimMc> Apparently we used to give out t-shirts and that was a *nightmare*.
[21:29:55] <danieldg> interesting issue, makes sense though
[21:30:37] <TimMc> Customs in some random country would just steal the t-shirt, or shipping around the world would cost a large amount of money and take forever
[21:30:56] <danieldg> there have to be companies that can help out with this (the finder signs up with them as a bounty finder, you pay the company a bounty fee as a more standard contract)
[21:31:06] <TimMc> Yeah, probably.
[21:31:28] <TimMc> Maybe we could find one with a pro-rata contract.
[21:31:35] <danieldg> because otherwise you probably have to file taxes in every random country
[21:31:41] <TimMc> oh god, yeah
[21:31:50] <TimMc> There's also OFAC and other nonsense.
[21:32:19] <TimMc> I hear that gift cards might be possible, though, so I'm going to ask accounting if we can switch to that.
[21:32:30] <TimMc> Those can also be sold by the recipient, for better or worse. :-)
[21:33:39] <TimMc> ...hmm, we should probably have a public recognition page for people who found good vulnerabilities. That might be worth more to them than the money.
[21:34:39] *** Joins: zro (~zro@user/zro)
[21:34:45] <danieldg> yeah, especially if they want to pivot to doing vuln analysis contracting
[21:35:07] <danieldg> which is a much less random income stream
[21:35:52] <TimMc> (we're a non-profit, for additional context)
[21:37:40] <danieldg> as someone who stays far away from legal, contracting, and finance, I don't see how that would make a difference :D
[21:39:26] <ericonr> danieldg: I'm pretty sure there's a platform for disclosure where companies sign up, forgot the name rn
[21:39:52] <ericonr> But there was some drama around their policies too
[21:40:56] <danieldg> yeah, if the company is doing the determination of "is it a vulnerability" there is guaranteed drama
