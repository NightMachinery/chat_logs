[00:42:57] <phoebos> what is the "autocryptdoc" referred to in neomuttrc(5)?
[00:47:51] <phoebos> i've been testing autocrypt with neomutt, and sending messages is fine, but autocrypt can never find a valid autocrypt key for encryption, even when replying to an autocrypted message :/

[04:00:32] <flatcap> hi dcpurton
[04:00:48] <flatcap> is it easy to repeat?
[04:03:48] <dcpurton> I see it when the window gets larger but not smaller
[04:04:05] <dcpurton> e.g., consider a window taking up 1/4 of my screen
[04:04:31] <dcpurton> If I remove a terminal such that the NeoMutt window resizes to full height taking up half the screen
[04:04:47] <dcpurton> then the status bar is drawn twice
[04:04:55] <dcpurton> once half way up the screen and once at the bottom
[04:05:09] <dcpurton> and the bottom half of the window is blank
[04:05:14] <dcpurton> ^L refreshes
[04:05:59] <flatcap> thanks, I see that too

[06:28:48] <phoebos> flatcap: I've found why none of the autocrypt people were being put into the database
[06:29:26] <phoebos> env->autocrypt is always NULL because in mutt_rfc822_parse_line the autocrypt stuff is under 't'
[06:29:50] <phoebos> and i think that function happens once per header, can't see any state variables
[06:30:05] <phoebos> maybe the idea was autocrypt only works if there's a To: field?

[16:49:02] <gahr> but I don't care much.. neomutt is an end-user application, it should be fine to push updates to the quartly branches too

[16:50:58] <gahr> for freebsd, because I don't care :)
[16:51:07] <gahr> and you shouldn't, too
[16:51:43] <gahr> we cut off quarterly branches at the beginning of each quarter

[17:20:22] <realguy> Hello, what is the best way to install the latest nemutt version on Ubuntu 20.04 is very old. AFAIK comile it on my own is the way to go but maybe an other way exists?
[17:22:42] <flatcap> I'm not a Debian/Ubuntu user, but long ago some one said:
[17:22:44] <flatcap> > adding "deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian testing main" to my sources.list worked
[17:22:55] <flatcap> (so I made a note :-)
[17:24:03] <flatcap> the latest version is 2021-10-29 (a new one in a few weeks)
[17:24:56] <realguy> I hope this will not cause a conflict when I add a debian source in ubuntu.
[17:25:55] <flatcap> sorry, don't know.  I'd wait for someone who knows what they're talking about :-)
[17:27:05] <realguy> I think adding the debian source is no the best idea, I'm going the compiling way, but I don't want to :). I think I have to ...
[17:27:54] <bremner> yeah, it can certainly cause problems to mix debian and ubuntu packages
[17:28:04] <realguy> But yeah, I'll wait, I'm patient
[17:28:16] <bremner> you could rebuild the debian one from source, that should be OK
