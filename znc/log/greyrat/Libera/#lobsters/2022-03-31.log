[16:32:29] <Flisk> i'm specifically interested in what other lobsters think about the piece
[16:32:45] <iDrougge> I found it unreadable with the monospaced font.
[16:33:00] <jj5> Flisk: it's a hard problem, balancing long term support and security
[16:33:14] <iDrougge> I think my brain entered code mode instead of prose mode.
[16:33:39] <iDrougge> jj5: OTOH, promising three-year support for end-of-lifed software is silly.
[16:35:10] <Flisk> yeah, backporting security fixes from newer releases only goes so far
[16:35:31] <edk> i think it's important work and nobody else is doing it
[16:37:24] <edk> stable distros fix a critical impedance mismatch between what free software developers want to do and what a lot of people with computers want to do
[16:42:43] <Foxboron> >The internal strive made several leading members simply quit Debian (without joining Devuan), and many people felt "betrayed" by how the systemd conflict was handled.
[16:42:53] <Foxboron> I'm actually sure how accurate this is
[16:43:23] <edk> debian seems to be not very good at handling project-level decisions, socially
[16:43:31] <edk> there's a lot of drama now around usrmerge
[16:43:42] <Foxboron> Mostly because people where unhappy both at the outcome of "lets support systemd, but keep the door open for other inits" which has resulted in a fairly poor systemd implementation at the distro level
[16:44:25] <Foxboron> but portraying it people being "betrayed" is the form of stuff anti-systemd people like to write to try and imply systemd was unpopular to begin with (it wasn't)

[16:44:59] <edk> i mean, systemd was pretty controversial
[16:45:12] <gerikson> I think Debian's mission was easier back before Linux got *huge*
[16:45:23] <iDrougge> The colour of a bikeshed is also pretty controversial to those standing around it.
[16:45:28] <gerikson> having a stable OS is important for some applications
[16:45:42] <edk> it's not unpopular now but i think that's largely because most of us have better things to do than fight about it
[16:45:44] <gerikson> iDrougge: Plato's bikeshed
[16:46:15] <Foxboron> edk: You think it's controversial because the only thing you heard is the drama
[16:46:27] <iDrougge> I never see Mac people argue about launchd.
[16:46:38] <gerikson> the only citations that piece makes is random Phoronix pieces
[16:46:52] <Foxboron> Same way you hear more negative feedbak then positive feedback. The positive stuff usually never takes the front seat
[16:46:55] <edk> i never see iDrougge say anything useful, there's no need to go on about what we don't see
[16:47:03] <Foxboron> gerikson: Heh, that's not good
[16:47:27] <edk> linux people argue about systemd because linux people are generally working a bit closer to the metal
[16:47:34] <iDrougge> edk: I'm very sorry you feel that way.
[16:47:53] <edk> it's not a feeling, it's an observation
[16:48:00] <epilys> Complaining is Shit and Ruining New Developers [meta culture rant]
[16:48:18] <edk> it doesn't matter to me as a desktop user what my desktop's init system is doing because i ~never interact with it
[16:48:36] <edk> well, as a linux desktop user it does sometimes, because a lot of linux desktop apps don't come with an installer, but that's a bit of a tangent
[16:49:16] <edk> but many people who run linux are configuring servers and will probably interact with their init system quite a bit, so it's relevant what that init system is like
[16:50:54] <edk> the odd part is that systemd is generally quite a bit less annoying than what it replaced, so i guess a lot of it is just people not liking change
[16:51:15] <gerikson> edk: very much so
[16:51:16] <river> yeah
[16:51:23] <edk> but... it's not *only* that. occasionally systemd's developers will decide to impose a stupid opinion on everyone
[16:51:50] <gerikson> at least they're moving forward, not deciding that 1970s decisions should be fixed in stone
[16:51:53] <river> it's one of the most interesting things in open source sociology
[16:52:07] <edk> gerikson: yes
[16:52:45] <iDrougge> What both gerikson and river said.
[16:52:46] <river> there's a whole bunch of factors like pulseaudio, cult of poettering, suspicious debian voting systems, red hat corp., tribalism, unix genius worship and so on that all add up
[16:52:59] <epilys> closing all your user processes (e.g. tmux and other daemons) when you log out was a pretty stupid decision
[16:53:25] <river> oh yeah and a bit of github issue brigading
[16:53:42] <wrl> also poettering really was not good at PR
[16:53:45] <edk> i don't think systemd is a net negative. i do think it's unnecessarily tedious sometimes
[16:53:59] <wrl> and was just actively and unnecessarily confrontational
[16:54:02] <jj5> I'm both for systemd and against it :P
[16:54:02] <edk> yes
[16:54:24] <wrl> i'm particularly remembering the "gentoo users, this is your wakeup call" email where he specifically was talking about kdbus replacing netlink and thus breaking eudev
[16:54:45] <Flisk> wrl: are you joking? i can imagine no better way to represent your software project than jumping on stage and having a heated discussion with the speaker during a talk about your project that you have some gripes with. :^)

[16:57:17] <Flisk> in fairness, it's not so much during the talk as towards the end.
[16:57:51] <lep> i think i was there
[16:57:56] <lep> i was one time in berlin
[16:58:00] <lep> and two times in hamburg
[16:58:41] <lep> afair there was quite the crowd in front
[16:58:46] <lep> watching on the monitors
[16:59:33] <q3k> 'predictable network interfaces' are the biggest systemd blunder
[16:59:53] <q3k> if you're gonna do it, do it well, actually record things by physical address, and let users easily specify renames
[17:00:08] <q3k> tying interface naming to position on the usb or pcie bus is batshit crazy
[17:00:35] <q3k> s,the,a,
[17:01:26] <edk> yes, the predictable names seem like a solution to a problem that might affect someone, somewhere, in theory, maybe
[17:01:28] <q3k> i really like what systemd did with units and even logging, but yeah, then there's just these weird decisions that are seemingly taken by people with zero real world knowledge about how linux is used
[17:01:39] <edk> they don't cause me too many headaches though
[17:02:03] <q3k> they're fine until you reach a machine that enumerates network cards in different order on the PCIe bes per bootup
[17:02:16] <river> is that a real machine???
[17:02:19] <q3k> of course
[17:02:20] <river> kill it with fire
[17:02:25] <q3k> why? it's perfectly fine to do this
[17:02:31] <river> this is fine.jpg
[17:02:34] <edk> machines that do that would also normally swap eth0/eth1
[17:02:47] <q3k> yes, but eth0/eth1 aren't sold as 'predictiable network names'
[17:02:51] <edk> true
[17:02:57] <q3k> plus in practice most distros would actually then remember physical address mapping
[17:03:01] <edk> but i mean, most of the things systemd does wrong are just annoying, not actually making things materially worse
[17:03:05] <edk> this is one of them
[17:03:10] <q3k> so that they would be renamed, but based on a local database
[17:03:32] <edk> and i can live with a little bit of annoying. writing unit files is much easier than writing ye olde init scripts
[17:03:35] <q3k> instead of living in a fantasy world where bus enumeration is idempotent and thus we don't need no stinking state

[17:11:32] <Foxboron> >Both Arch Linux, Artix Linux and Gentoo Linux are extremely fast in providing security fixes from upstream developers.
[17:11:33] <Foxboron> lol
[17:11:43] <river> heh
[17:11:52] <Foxboron> Gee, I wonder *why* Artix is fast
[17:11:58] <Foxboron> is it because Arch does all the work for them?
[17:12:23] <Foxboron> And that is a shallow understand how what Arch does. We are worse than Debian tracking security issues because of the amount of work it requires
[17:12:36] <Foxboron> and because of the inane quality MITRE puts out in the form of CVE data
[17:12:59] *** Joins: timj (~timj@user/timj)
[17:13:31] <Foxboron> If you just want to judge this by "Arch updates packages fast" then.. that is one way to measure it but I wouldn't call that a focus on security. It's an incidental bi-effect of having a simple package release procedure
[17:13:41] <Foxboron> (which is what the author is *actually* talking about there)
[17:14:26] <wink> edk: I think the main problem is that systemd brought new problems to the people who had no problems before. I fully acknowledge that it probably solved the issues of the opposite side
[17:14:30] <Foxboron> Ah, and obviously a patreon link at the bottom. Always included in inflammatory posts
[17:14:37] <Flisk> to be fair, the author doesn't argue that a focus on security is what causes fast patches on arch or gentoo

[17:15:24] <Foxboron> Flisk: They don't explain why either. But they do write "providing security fixes" which makes it read like that is what is being done.

[17:15:56] <Flisk> i mean, that's what shipping newer versions ends up doing, even if it's incidental
[17:16:14] <Foxboron> But that is not "providing security fixes"
[17:16:38] <Flisk> whether the comparison between those distros is a good way to make the point is questionable

[17:18:25] <Foxboron> I don't think focusing on the incidental aspect of providing fast updates is correct when they are 5 lines up argueing Debian lies to their users
[17:18:58] <Flisk> probably not, no. that point could have been made in a more sensible manner.
[17:19:36] <Foxboron> All in all, inflammatory posts written for the shake of clickbait sharing
[17:19:41] <Foxboron> sake*
[17:19:49] <Foxboron> I rate it a C- considering I did actually read it
[17:21:11] <edk> I think the point the article fails to consider (along with most other people discussing it online) is that Debian's job is much harder
[17:21:15] <Foxboron> Fuck me, they have another posts about this very topic
[17:21:31] <Foxboron> edk: As an Arch maintainer I admire Debian a lot really
[17:21:41] <edk> they're protecting overworked admins from constantly having to react to random breakage
[17:21:59] <Flisk> yeah, that part seems somewhat lost on the author
[17:22:26] <Flisk> i think their core criticism is valid though, debian isn't communicating the "maintenance state" of a bunch of their packages all that clearly
[17:22:36] <Foxboron> They are listing Artix as a majoar distribution along with Debian and OpenBSD
[17:22:38] <Foxboron> I can't even :)
[17:22:44] <edk> yes, possible
[17:23:31] <Flisk> finding out by sheer coincidence that i'm using a package that's been all but abandoned by its maintainers is not exactly ideal
[17:23:43] <Foxboron> I don't know if people find my blogpost meta commentary funny. But since they write so much shit about stuff they don't know

[18:03:01] <shapr> At least, that's how it looked to me.
[18:03:12] <wink> shapr: start of the pandemic I, like many people, tried the "meet via zoom" and for most people (those who I don't chat with) it jsut doesn't work. I'd rather do anything else with my time where otherwise I'd be looking forward to meeting tghem in person
[18:03:34] <wink> shapr: so I guess the TLDR is: video chat/online interaction doesnt need to be fixed in all cases
[18:03:34] <shapr> I'm tempted to dig in and post a long comment about how much CPU/RAM you get for how much money when choosing ThinkPad / Mac / System76 / framework

[18:05:49] <shapr> edk: that's starting to sound like useful detail
[18:06:03] <gwozniak> I found the laptop thread okay.  Not great, but okay.  One account seemed very annoyed at the idea that someone might like the M1.
[18:06:11] <shapr> I'd want a poster to describe their priorities and why/how their choice matched
[18:06:31] <wink> shapr: at least with the people I tried it it was like a party where everyone is talking at once, with a banana in their mouth. no flow of interaction, awkward silence, etc..
[18:06:42] <edk> if they could do that in a relatively neutral way i'd probably like it, but mostly people say this thing sucks! without acknowledging that other people have different needs

[18:07:34] <edk> i think one can be pretty incendiary in e-prime
[18:07:37] <shapr> if you remove the "is of identity" you aren't able to say "this is bad" you can only say how it doesn't fit what you wanted
[18:07:43] <shapr> edk: oh, how?
[18:07:44] <edk> for instance, i find macos to suck a great deal
[18:08:32] <shapr> wink: so if your videochat friends had a good microphone and camera, and you also had that, and you all took turns talking, the experience would be improved?
[18:08:35] <gwozniak> edk: seeing the other side of "it sucks" is also like being on the receiving end of a nasty bug report.  You have to try to understand why the customer wrote such a thing (or is trying to do something that is seemingly ridiculous)
[18:08:47] <edk> e-prime also requires quite a bit of circumlocution around the present continuous
[18:09:23] <edk> (which i believe myself to be exemplifying here)
[18:09:39] <shapr> I think I need to expand on the "fix the USER?" section and describe how I had conversational difficulties when I moved to Finland, because the convention is a ten second pause after someone is finished speaking.
[18:10:18] <edk> gwozniak: yeah
[18:10:34] <shapr> One person I asked said that conversations sometimes lasted longer or shorter than they wanted, and that's why they didn't start as many video chats.
[18:10:35] <edk> but it would have been easier to stay cool if they'd just said why they didn't like it
[18:10:52] <shapr> I opined that was part of "fix the user" where they needed to set expectations ahead of time.

[18:12:10] <shapr> You will want to have a good stereo separation setup for that video; either headphones or left/right speakers set far apart.
[18:13:03] <wink> shapr: I wouldn't say I have a low tolerance, I am not one of those "podcast mic or gtfo" peopl, I jsut hate the coworkers and mac users who refuse to even use a cheap headset and you hear them crunching or tapping the desk etc. of course you'll make an exception for a friend who does not do this every day, but the main point is just that I don't see conversations happening. it's always 1:1 at most. or 1:n
[18:13:58] <shapr> I think that's also part of "fix the user", my mother taught me "conversational ball" when I was a kid, where I explicitly pass the active conversational role to another by asking them a question about the current topic
[18:14:18] <companion_cube> "sorry, i forgot a pan on the stove" and hang up
[18:14:18] <wink> I dunno, I've heard from people who had no problems with audio/video calls. but for me it's very dependent on the people. and maybe on their setup, but hardly
[18:14:35] <shapr> I do wonder if one improvement is a "how to" article on giving others equal time in a conversation.
[18:15:12] <wink> I attended a conf via gather.town lately and while it could work (and as I heard did work in the past), this time it didn't really.
[18:15:25] <wink> no one talked to each other. no chatting up random people in the hallway
[18:15:25] <shapr> wink: any specifics on why/how it didn't work?
[18:15:44] <wink> no. everyone used the break to take actual breaks from the computer I guess

[18:23:28] <gwozniak> shapr: I have my attention focused on the source of the sound/video in an online call.  In a room, I'm focused on something else
[18:24:27] <shapr> I know zoom and discord audio can adjust the noise floor, I wish that were easily done for all audio chats.
[18:24:37] <gwozniak> Incidental noise in a cafeteria, for example, despite there being a lot of it, doesn't really bother me.  But if I'm trying to talk to someone online and there is a lot of background noise, it is coming from the same source as the person
[18:24:40] <shapr> That is, zoom and discord can set the minimum volume level required to "send audio"
[18:25:09] <wink> I think y'all are talking about the windows/mac evrsion of zoom
[18:25:09] <shapr> gwozniak: is that because of spatial separation as in the video I linked above?

[21:57:26] <JordiGH> The 72 instead of 80 limit is to allow for 8 characters of >>>> when you need to replyreplyreplyreply to commit messages in your mailing list.
[21:58:01] <JordiGH> From your mutt email client.
[21:58:11] <technomancy> JordiGH: so the worse your code is, the more margin you need to provide, logically
[21:58:12] <JordiGH> In your tiny dumb terminal.
[22:01:57] <JordiGH> Hm, besides linux and git, what else does commit messages where they explain what they're doing and even do stuff like putting code samples in the commit message or benchmark results?

[22:07:53] <technomancy> yeah honestly I'm lukewarm on using git over email, except that I've found that it's trained me to write way better commit messages, assuming that the message is part of the review process.
[22:08:07] <JordiGH> That's what I'm talking about: https://gitea.wisellama.rocks/Mirrors/git/commit/da5267f1b66dfe83a92698e49fa10dee5f74224f

[22:22:23] <JordiGH> Hm, cvs had them.
[22:22:28] <JordiGH> And that was never intended for Linux.
[22:23:26] <JordiGH> git didn't originate the idea of commit message. It did add that stupid signoff line because of legal reasons, though.
[22:23:35] <JordiGH> Git's version of the CLA, I guess.
