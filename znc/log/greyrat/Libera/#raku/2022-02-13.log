[20:28:10] <nine> Voldenet: in that specific example, you may be able to access Pair.a via trickery. But in general NativeCall doesn't support this use case yet. You may have to use a wrapper library written in C that puts this structure onto the heap and returns a pointer
[20:28:23] <Voldenet> Yeah, that's the workaround I use
[20:28:29] <Voldenet> malloc, memcpy and pointer
[20:29:05] <Voldenet> …and the trickery would be using int64 I suppose
[20:29:12] <Voldenet> or Pointer
[20:29:39] <nine> exactly

[21:13:47] <guifa> lizmat: with RAST's maturation, will traits be passed compiled stuff or will they have access to the RAST? Or will there potentially be a different way to get at the AST? (maybe a different trait_mod keyword?)
[21:14:22] <lizmat> guifa: good question...
[21:14:33] <lizmat> I have no idea, really
[21:14:46] <lizmat> I guess initially jnthn will want to go for the least amount of change
[21:15:00] <lizmat> so I don't think you'll be able to do more then
[21:15:23] <lizmat> and once there are macros, some of the trait_mod stuff may be obsolete anyway
[21:15:37] <guifa> Yeah, OT1H, keeping them receiving compiled won't break anything.  OTOH, there's some really cool stuff one could do accessing the AST
