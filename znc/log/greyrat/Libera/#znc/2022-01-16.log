[02:27:22] <r00tobo> tardnado: can you be more specific?
[02:27:30] <tardnado> sure
[02:27:42] <tardnado> right now im spinning up a fresh arch install but 
[02:28:22] <tardnado> i can get znc running just fine, and it connects to my chosen network, however i am unable to connect to the web ui or with hexchat to the znc

[02:28:36] <tardnado> im starting from scratch yet again right now :\
[02:28:54] <r00tobo> do you have firewall in place?
[02:29:00] <tardnado> networking is not my strong point
[02:29:26] <tardnado> im using windows 10
[02:29:38] <r00tobo> no i mean on the vps
[02:29:39] <tardnado> so whatever firewall that might have native
[02:29:40] <tardnado> oh
[02:30:05] <tardnado> i did not install one 
[02:30:14] <tardnado> i used ufw when i was trying with ubuntu
[02:30:42] <r00tobo> then make sure you open the znc port with ufw allow PORT/tcp
[02:31:13] <tardnado> should i install ubuntu instead of arch?
[02:31:59] <r00tobo> not needed
[02:32:10] <tardnado> ok so theres no default firewall in arch
[02:32:29] <r00tobo> if so then make sure you know the right znc port you put during the initial setup

[02:34:09] <tardnado> (again lol)
[02:35:32] <r00tobo> you see the "Listen on port" part? that's the znc port for the web and irc
[02:37:46] <tardnado> should i listen using ssl
[02:38:30] <tardnado> it defaults to no
[02:39:18] <MetaNova> yes
[02:40:08] <tardnado> eh i already put no
[02:40:21] <tardnado> should i redo it?
[02:41:28] <PeGaSuS> it is fine to not run using SSL/TLS as you can set it up later on though
[02:42:12] <tardnado> ok launched and connected to irc
[02:42:13] <MetaNova> sure, just make more work for yourself later, great idea
[02:42:27] <tardnado> now is where i cant proceed

[02:44:01] <tardnado> idk?
[02:44:15] <tardnado> networking i am dumb
[02:44:32] <tardnado> this is where i get stuck idk what to do
[02:44:48] <r00tobo> what port did you pick?
[02:45:41] <tardnado> something like 2027
[02:45:51] <r00tobo> http://serverip:2027
[02:45:55] <tardnado> right
[02:45:56] <r00tobo> in your browser
[02:45:56] <tardnado> times out
[02:46:23] <r00tobo> if you followed that tutorial 
[02:46:27] <tardnado> i did
[02:46:30] <r00tobo> do systemctl status znc

[02:50:45] <tardnado> i just cant connect to it
[02:50:56] <tardnado> i have spent hours trying to get past this point
[02:51:11] <tardnado> do i need to open a port on the znc
[02:51:18] <tardnado> port 2027
[02:51:40] <r00tobo> if you don't have a firewall running on the host machine you don't have to
[02:52:07] <tardnado> i didnt explicitly run one
[02:52:25] <r00tobo> vultr have some kind of external firewall ?
[02:52:28] <tardnado> idk
[02:52:39] <MetaNova> no
[02:52:48] <MetaNova> not unless specifically configured in the client portal
[02:53:00] <tardnado> pacman -Ss iptables    ?
[02:53:15] <r00tobo> tardnado: check your client portal if it's enabled or not
[02:53:36] <tardnado> client portal
[02:53:45] <r00tobo> vultr's client portal
[02:53:51] <r00tobo> where you reboot start etc..
[02:55:16] <tardnado> yeah i mean
[02:56:05] <tardnado> is the vultr client running? yes
[02:56:13] <tardnado> im not sure i understand what you are asking
[02:56:18] <tardnado> im looking at the control panel
[02:56:27] <r00tobo> yeah i mean the control panel of vultr
[02:56:58] <tardnado> right . im looking at it
[03:01:05] <tardnado> netstat -lntu
[03:03:06] <r00tobo> if you see :2027 there that means the socket is open but if you have a firewall running it will block any incoming connection to that port
[03:03:42] <r00tobo> that's why i told you to check the control panel if you don't have an internal firewall inside the os

[03:12:04] <tardnado> i had this thing running a several months
[03:12:17] <r00tobo> what webui?
[03:12:25] <tardnado> znc webui
[03:12:50] <r00tobo> I don't get what you say
[03:12:59] <r00tobo> is it working now or used to work ?
[03:13:00] <tardnado> znc has a web interface
[03:13:05] <r00tobo> correct
[03:13:13] <tardnado> i used to have znc working
[03:13:18] <tardnado> i destroyed the server
[03:13:26] <tardnado> now i cant get it working again
[03:13:37] <tardnado> i used znc for 3 or 4 months
[03:13:45] <tardnado> until i destroyed the server
[03:13:54] <r00tobo> ok now when you try to install znc and follow that tut do you use ssh or vnc terminal inside the client area?
[03:14:26] <tardnado> i use the console inside the client
[03:14:46] <r00tobo> what about using putty?
[03:14:59] <r00tobo> see if you can connect with putty
[03:15:05] <tardnado> ok
[03:15:14] <r00tobo> do you know what putty is?
[03:15:18] <tardnado> yes
[03:15:23] <tardnado> i already have iut running
[03:15:39] <tardnado> what connection type
[03:15:49] <r00tobo> ssh default
[03:15:53] <r00tobo> should be the default

[03:16:27] <tardnado> times out
[03:16:27] <r00tobo> and connect see if it asks you for a user or password
[03:16:32] <r00tobo> ahuh
[03:17:25] <r00tobo> all i have to say is that there is some sort of a firewall in between you and the server
[03:17:46] <r00tobo> did you check the client area of vultr ?
[03:17:57] <tardnado> yeah i dont see anything anywhere about a firewall
[03:18:17] <r00tobo> I don't use vultr so...
[03:18:42] <r00tobo> MetaNova: do you happen to know what is going on here?
[03:18:48] <MetaNova> nope.
[03:23:01] <r00tobo> tardnado: honestly I can't figure out the exact culprit 
[03:23:08] <r00tobo> but it looks to me a firewall issue
[03:23:33] <MetaNova> without being able to externally confirm the port is open on the IP address in question it's a moot point
[03:23:53] <r00tobo> I agree
[03:24:26] <r00tobo> tardnado: https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/
[03:24:34] <r00tobo> put your server ip and the port number there
[03:24:47] <r00tobo> if you see a green flag it means it's open

[03:30:33] <tardnado> how to open a port in arch or is this a vultr thing
[03:31:02] <tardnado> Additionally, if your server has a custom app, that listens on specific port, say 2828, this also requires firewall modification.
[03:31:05] <MetaNova> if you don't remember specifically configuring firewall rules in the vultr account portal, then that sounds like a google question
[03:31:08] <tardnado> ok i need to open a port in arch
[03:31:32] <tardnado> wait i see it now
[03:31:39] <tardnado> https://bobcares.com/blog/vultr-open-port/
[03:31:49] <tardnado> Vultr offers a web-based firewall solution. This Firewall service can be managed from the Vultr control panel. In this, the packet filtering takes place at a higher level on the network and therefore reduce resource usage on the server.
[03:31:52] <tardnado> WHAT
[03:31:58] <tardnado> WHERE I DONT SEE IT
[03:32:00] <tardnado> >8(
[03:33:12] <MetaNova> my dude
[03:33:13] <MetaNova> https://my.vultr.com/firewall/
[03:33:28] <MetaNova> it's literally an option on the landing page when you first log in
[03:35:18] <tardnado> haha i totally k-knew that haha
[03:35:23] <tardnado> i was just testing you guys
[03:35:32] <tardnado> you passed btw
[03:36:19] <tardnado> what protocol do i need to accept tcp?
[03:37:06] <MetaNova> ZNC uses TCP
[03:37:08] <tardnado> im not even embarrassed at all
[03:37:12] <tardnado> not even a little bit
[03:37:18] <DarthGandalf> TCP=Transmission Control Protocol
[03:37:21] <DarthGandalf> it is a protocol
[03:37:54] <MetaNova> you're not configuring a vultr firewall rule, are you?
[03:39:08] <tardnado> i did yes
[03:39:37] <tardnado> i need to connect to it
[03:39:50] <tardnado> so i created a rule
[03:40:22] <MetaNova> is the port open now?
[03:41:23] <tardnado> accept tcp (port)
[03:41:56] <tardnado> <MetaNova> you're not configuring a vultr firewall rule, are you?   < why did you say this
[03:42:20] <MetaNova> in the absence of a vultr firewall, the port is being blocked in the OS
[03:42:43] <MetaNova> creating a vultr firewall rule will not invalidate whatever is causing the OS to deem the port blocked
[03:42:49] <MetaNova> so I ask again
[03:42:51] <MetaNova> is the port open now?
[03:43:02] <tardnado> no
[03:43:21] <MetaNova> then it sounds like you need to google how to open a port in arch

[18:17:26] <wendyg> Anyone might be able to help with a "broken pipe" error on attempted connection?
[18:21:23] <tek_dmn> I might be able to help, wendyg 
[18:21:38] <wendyg> OK.
[18:21:57] *** Quits: ProperNoun (~holyShizn@user/propernoun) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:22:06] <wendyg> I will open by saying I'm using Pidgin, which the configuration page says is "crap" without suggesting anything better or saying why it's "crap"
[18:23:03] <wendyg> Everything I've tried leads to this error: "Lost connection with server: broken pipe"
[18:23:44] <wendyg> I've been through the settings with the person who owns the ZNC server, and everything *seems* correct.
[18:24:05] <tek_dmn> Pidgin is.. special just because the way it does configuration.
[18:24:29] <wendyg> OK. It would be helpful if the page explained that. :)
[18:24:47] <tek_dmn> it might be.
[18:25:00] <wendyg> Or suggested an alternative!
[18:25:10] <tek_dmn> HexChat, most likely.
[18:25:34] <wendyg> OK, well. If we *could* get Pidgin working that would be nice, because my other machine is a Windows laptop, and it also has Pidgin.
[18:25:37] <tek_dmn> broken pipe means... for some reason the connection got closed without your side noticing, so it tried to send data to a connection that's no longer active.
[18:25:52] <wendyg> And then I could just copy the settings.
[18:25:52] <tek_dmn> You get nothing in any form of logs or status message?
[18:26:17] <wendyg> No, I think the connection is failing too quickly for status messages beyond that.
[18:26:32] <wendyg> I did not think to look for a log, but as you say there is one.
[18:26:32] <tek_dmn> And you're sure that the port and SSL settings are correct
[18:26:45] <wendyg> Except what it's logging is this 
[18:27:06] <wendyg> I'm sure the port is.
[18:27:32] <wendyg> I sent the guy the entire list of all settings, and the only two he picked out were the password and the port. 
[18:27:46] <wendyg> (Which I had tried before, but set to what he said)
[18:27:57] <tek_dmn> Password should complain about a bad password, if it's even halfway intelligentl
[18:28:05] <wendyg> That's what I thought too.
[18:28:29] <tek_dmn> ZNC's TLS will do an immediate disconnect if you don't have it matching (since an IRC command is not a valid TLS ClientHello)
[18:29:01] <tek_dmn> Anyways, what about the log? Unless you mean it's just logging the chat history
[18:29:08] <wendyg> It's just logging this chat!
[18:29:45] <tek_dmn> Unfortunately, "broken pipe" without any other data isn't the most diagnosable error, besides toggling the TLS switch and trying again
[18:30:26] <wendyg> Pidgin offers the following options: Use SSL, Authenticate with SASL; Allow plaintext SASL, auth over unencrypted connection
[18:31:01] <tek_dmn> I assume you're using server password for authentication, not SASL
[18:31:27] <tek_dmn> In which case, you want to use SSL, no SASL.
[18:31:30] <wendyg> All of those are unticked.
[18:31:44] <tek_dmn> inluding use ssl?
[18:31:50] <wendyg> I have tried ticking them in turn, to no effect
[18:32:15] *** Joins: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c)
[18:32:20] <tek_dmn> Do me a favor, what's the server and port you're using?
[18:33:05] <wendyg> znc.quatermass.co.uk 6697
[18:33:15] <wendyg> If you tick to use SSL,m the network is not found
[18:33:15] <tek_dmn> that's definitely SSL required
[18:33:39] <wendyg> But...
[18:33:58] <tek_dmn> 6697 is the SSL port.
[18:34:14] <wendyg> Yes, but people do all sorts of things with ports.
[18:34:29] <wendyg> He said use that port; he did not say turn on SSL
[18:34:40] <wendyg> Of course, I have no way of knowing how fast he read the email
[18:35:02] <tek_dmn> People do weird things, but violating conventions is not one of them
[18:35:06] <tek_dmn> usualy
[18:35:17] <wendyg> But if I tell Pidgin to use SSL the network is not found.
[18:35:35] <tek_dmn> then you're doing more than SSL, because that shouldn't affect it.
[18:36:06] * wendyg finds that "shouldn't" has very little to do with what computers do
[18:36:19] <wendyg> I will see if I can make it work in Hexchat
[18:37:00] <tek_dmn> Yes, znc.quatermass.co.uk uses SSL on port 6697
[18:37:42] <tek_dmn> That's why you have a broken pipe, it's disconnecting due to a failed TLS handshake.
[18:37:50] <tek_dmn> As for the other...
[18:39:33] <tek_dmn> The best I can say is you're changing something else, because that's not how SSL works
[18:40:50] <wendyg> I can only tell you how it's labeled.
[18:41:06] *** Quits: anonymip (~anonymip@user/anonymip) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:41:16] <tek_dmn> And I can tell you that there's something else going on
[18:41:29] <wendyg> I believe you. I just don't have any way to identify what it is.
[18:41:38] <tek_dmn> So let's verify this.
[18:41:43] <tek_dmn> account settings.
[18:42:18] <tek_dmn> Protocol, IRC. Username, whatever you were given. Server, znc.quatermass.co.uk. Password, your password.
[18:42:52] <tek_dmn> Advanced tab. Port, 6697. Encodings, UTF-8. Use SSL, yes. Authenticate with SASL, no.
[18:43:18] <wendyg> Yes.
[18:43:28] <wendyg> What do you make the formatting for the password? 
[18:43:50] <wendyg> There seems to be some suggesting that the user name needs to be included
[18:43:51] <tek_dmn> probably username:password
[18:44:54] <wendyg> That is how it is presently set
[18:45:46] <tek_dmn> You could try just the password, but that shouldn't matter. "Network not found" isn't related to authentication
[18:46:06] <tek_dmn> It's also nondescript enough that the one thing I think it could correlate to... doesn't apply here
[18:48:02] <wendyg> I really appreciate the help, but I don't think we're going to be able to solve this.
[18:48:35] <wendyg> I will have to get someone else on that channel who's successfully connected to go through with me how they did it.
[18:51:25] <tek_dmn> I just did.
