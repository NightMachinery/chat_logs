[02:05:32] <Steve-Dusty> help
[02:05:35] <Steve-Dusty> this is driving me crazy
[02:14:40] <mattmcc> It probably put the script in /home/stevek/.local/bin which may not be in $PATH.
[02:15:46] <dre> Steve-Dusty, are you in a venv? you should be. I think I told you this last time
[02:15:57] <Steve-Dusty> how do I check
[02:16:04] <Steve-Dusty> If I close termianl shouldn't it leave
[02:16:11] <Steve-Dusty> it's been happening for the past few months
[02:17:22] <dre> Steve-Dusty, `python3 -m venv .env --prompt="dusty"`
[02:17:26] <dre> then
[02:17:41] <dre> `. .env/bin/activate`
[02:17:55] <dre> without the ` ` of course
[02:17:56] <Steve-Dusty> done
[02:18:11] <dre> oh zsh, try . .env/bin/activate.zsh
[02:18:47] <dre> then just pip install django
[02:18:56] <Steve-Dusty> dre
[02:19:01] <Steve-Dusty> I want to leave the Virtual env
[02:19:18] <Steve-Dusty> `.: no such file or directory: .env/bin/activate.zsh`
[02:19:23] <dre> if you close the terminal, you'll leave.
[02:19:37] <dre> but the problem is, you don't want to leave the virtual .env - that is where your shit is
[02:19:43] <Steve-Dusty> I left it
[02:19:53] <Steve-Dusty> wait why did u want me to create an .env
[02:19:57] <Steve-Dusty> I just wanna reset everytrhing
[02:19:59] <dre> if you start doing stuff outside of the virtual env, you start to fuck up system packages
[02:20:00] <Steve-Dusty> I don't want any venvs
[02:20:01] <dre> which is what you're doing
[02:20:12] <Steve-Dusty> ok so what do I do
[02:20:14] <dre> you need an venv, otherwise everything will be messier
[02:20:16] <Steve-Dusty> I left the virtual env tho
[02:20:17] <Steve-Dusty> I just pipenv
[02:20:35] <Steve-Dusty> so I fucked everything up there's no coming basck now I need to reinstall arch :(
[02:20:39] <dre> right now the env I got you to make is ".env" if you delete the folder the .env is gone
[02:20:49] <dre> yes, perhaps, because you DIDN'T use an env.
[02:20:54] <dre> I'm sure arch is fine.
[02:21:17] <dre> "env" just means "put everything I do with python into this folder called .env"
[02:21:36] <Steve-Dusty> ok
[02:21:38] <Steve-Dusty> can I delete it
[02:21:41] <Steve-Dusty> where is .env located in
[02:21:48] <dre> "and give me a --prompt="dusty"  to remind me when I am in the env or not
[02:21:54] <dre> `ls .env`
[02:22:00] <dre> its right where you typed the commands.
[02:22:18] <dre> but this isn't system level python, it's project level python. it's that folder i just got you to create.
[02:22:26] <Steve-Dusty> got it
[02:22:36] <Steve-Dusty> so deleete it?
[02:22:37] <dre> delete it, that's fine, it's not going to undo the stuff you've done to system level python.
[02:22:40] <Steve-Dusty> what's the point of creating it
[02:22:51] <dre> because I was trying to give you a fresh start, because you're confused.
[02:23:02] <dre> you can delete it, re create it, and start again, very easily.
[02:23:04] <Steve-Dusty> No, Im not in a env when this happened
[02:23:12] <Steve-Dusty> it just not added in path
[02:23:19] <dre> yes, I know
[02:23:19] <Steve-Dusty> some people let me echo django to path and it works
[02:23:22] <Steve-Dusty> but I forgot the command
[02:23:51] <dre> so rather than fucking up your system path and borking arch because it can't figure out how to run the kernel
[02:23:58] <dre> you can just do all this in an .env folder
[02:24:14] <dre> and the venv will automatically add things to your path, remove things from your path, install new tools etc,
[02:24:18] <Steve-Dusty> export PATH:$PATH:/home/stevek/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/django
[02:24:20] <dre> all in that one little project folder called .env.
[02:24:22] <Steve-Dusty> so I can just do this?
[02:24:36] <Steve-Dusty> i just want to fix what I fucked up
[02:24:40] <Steve-Dusty> and I'll use an env afterwards
[02:24:43] <dre> yeah sure that'd work
[02:25:09] <Steve-Dusty> export: not valid in this content:....
[02:25:17] <dre> :P
[02:25:27] <Steve-Dusty> wut
[02:25:33] <Steve-Dusty> wait
[02:25:34] <Steve-Dusty> was that sarcasm?
[02:25:49] <dre> no, it should work if you know what you're doing
[02:25:59] <dre> but you don't, So I can't help you other than to say "do things properly"
[02:26:27] <dre> I don't know how fucked your system is, I can only tell you how to not fuck up your system further.
[02:26:47] <Steve-Dusty> lmao just use windows 11
[02:27:14] <dre> windows uses a venv for you, afaik.
[02:27:29] <Steve-Dusty> y linux so hard
[02:27:34] <Steve-Dusty> is ther a linux book or something
[02:27:35] <dre> but devingon windows is more of a pain
[02:27:41] <dre> Steve-Dusty, because you don't listen
[02:27:48] <dre> close the terminal
[02:27:49] <dre> open a new one
[02:27:56] <Steve-Dusty> literally did
[02:27:58] <dre> `cd` to your project folder.
[02:28:04] <dre> then type in the command that I gave above
[02:28:05] <Steve-Dusty> and create an env
[02:28:07] <dre> yes
[02:28:16] <Steve-Dusty> before I do that I want to fix my outside system first
[02:28:19] *** Quits: Rikem (~mike@user/rikem) (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
[02:28:23] <dre> then type in "source .env/bin/activate"
[02:28:29] <Steve-Dusty> I wanna fix before I keep going tho
[02:28:39] <Steve-Dusty> it's not normal to pip install something and it doesnt work
[02:28:39] <dre> don't put django in the outside system
[02:29:05] <dre> yes. because you've fucked things previously. let pacman -Syu fix all that.
[02:29:13] <dre> pacman should be dealing with system packages. not pip.
[02:29:17] <dre> do not pip in the system
[02:29:29] <Steve-Dusty> u use arch tooo?
[02:30:20] <dre> so I don't give a shit about the rest of the system; for ANY python project, make a venv, activate it, and you'll find pip will ALWAYS work in you venv. everything is contained within the .env folder, and if you fuck shit up you can simply just delete the folder and make a new one.

[02:33:40] <Steve-Dusty> idk the venv lib
[02:33:42] <Steve-Dusty> it's too advanced
[02:33:45] <dre> it's not
[02:33:47] <Steve-Dusty> for me
[02:33:51] <dre> i gave you the only thing you need
[02:33:57] <Steve-Dusty> but I need to learn how to locate folders
[02:34:00] <Steve-Dusty> how to disable it
[02:34:02] <dre> python -m venv .env --prompt="x"
[02:34:02] <Steve-Dusty> etc
[02:34:03] <Steve-Dusty> check it
[02:34:10] <dre> you can't disable it, you just close the terminal.
[02:34:20] <dre> "locate folders"? ????
[02:34:43] <Steve-Dusty> for example
[02:34:48] <Steve-Dusty> "STEVE-FIND-ALL-VENVS"
[02:34:51] <Steve-Dusty> and it'll show all venvs
[02:34:55] <Steve-Dusty> and how to enable it
[02:34:58] <Steve-Dusty> i'll need to learn A LOT
[02:34:58] <dre> venv lib is standard, everything else is dumb shit that came before
[02:35:07] <dre> why would you find all venvs?
[02:35:07] <Steve-Dusty> while pipenv is just pipenv enable
[02:35:09] <Steve-Dusty> pipenv disable
[02:35:19] <Steve-Dusty> pipenv create
[02:35:22] <Steve-Dusty> pipenv uninstall
[02:35:24] <Steve-Dusty> easy af
[02:35:31] <dre> you'd only want the venv that your project is in ( which is in your projecty folder)
[02:35:39] <dre> you've listed 4 commands to my one.
[02:36:00] <Steve-Dusty> ok
[02:36:08] <Steve-Dusty> if I disabled it by closing terminal
[02:36:11] <Steve-Dusty> how do I enable it again

[12:58:14] <serafeim> hello again. i'm using a TimeField (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#timefield) ... can you recommend me a jquery javascript input for that ?
[13:00:27] <serafeim> also, do you have any idea why django doesn't use a type='time' for rendering the timefield but uses type='text' instead ?
[13:07:23] <serafeim> hmmm no answer?
[13:07:40] <serafeim> i had to use some django-widget-trickery to my field: {{ field|attr:"type:time"|add_class:"form-control-sm"|as_crispy_field }}

[13:24:43] <FunkyBob> serafeim: the reasons against using type=time are in the mailing list
[13:24:46] <FunkyBob> and likely trac
[13:25:06] <FunkyBob> I believe (a) it was poorly supported at the time, and (b) there were a fuck-tonne of i18n/l10n issues
[13:25:13] <FunkyBob> it was also discussed recently, iirc
[13:25:42] <FunkyBob> why not supply a custom field template instead of using widget-trickery and crispy forms?
[13:25:58] <serafeim> FunkyBob: i'm not very familiar with custom field templates
[13:26:29] <serafeim> also about the time i think it would be nice if the widget could be overriden so as to use type=time
[13:26:39] <FunkyBob> indeed, it would
[13:26:54] <FunkyBob> you could do that with a custom widget, or a custom widget template,
[13:27:11] <serafeim> right now the time widget just returns input: https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/forms/templates/django/forms/widgets/time.html
[13:27:14] <FunkyBob> widget templates are, imho, a very underdocumented feature
[13:27:24] <serafeim> FunkyBob: correct that's why i don't know anything aobut them :)
[13:28:08] <FunkyBob> well, yo ucould learn a lot from reading those in the source :)
[13:28:23] <serafeim> yes you are right
[13:29:15] <FunkyBob> but it also looks like you could sub-class the TimeInput, set ttype = 'time' and get most of what you want
[13:29:35] <serafeim> FunkyBob: yes that's what i saw from reading the input.html template :)

[21:55:24] <withered_wolf> Django post_save signal gets called when you call .save(commit=False) ... and also when you call .save()... I've got a form where I call .save(commit=False) so I can manipulate some data before calling .save(). Is there a way from within the post_save signal to see if commit=False?
[21:57:53] <withered_wolf> I am essentially just trying to prevent the post_save signal from getting called twice (which is what currently is happening)

[23:21:11] <nbjoerg> yay, running into old performance optimisations that turn out to change the semantics of the code

[23:41:29] <nbjoerg> so foo__icontains=bar is implemented as UPPER(foo) LIKE UPPER(bar) in the postgres backend, because LIKE is faster than ILIKE and 13 years ago, ILIKE couldn't use indices
[23:41:50] <nbjoerg> the fun is that I am now running into cases where the optimisation is not sound, e.g. giving wrong results
