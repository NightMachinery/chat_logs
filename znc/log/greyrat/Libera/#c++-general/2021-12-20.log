In which case, you need to compare using a fudge factor with a scale of what the values involved in the calculation were.

[01:54:11] <Alipha> Which means if you did `x - y`, where x and y were both 100.1, but x and/or y was the result of a computation, which means x and/or y may not be 100.0999984741, but a number very close to it, then you may get a result like 0.000002, which you need to treat as 0

[01:59:30] <Alipha> But if x and y are around 0.001, then the smallest difference that can be distinguished is about 0.00000000001. Which means 0.000002 should not be treated as zero, but instead, values smaller than 0.00000000001 should be treated as zero

[03:35:47] <KombuchaKip> InPhase: As in 32-bit, 64-bit, etc. But what about data precision?
[03:36:26] <InPhase> KombuchaKip: Data precision is the precision of a value that represents something in the real world, which is more meaningful for a very large amount of floating point data.
[03:36:39] * KombuchaKip nods
[03:36:44] <KombuchaKip> InPhase: Ok, still reading.
[03:37:25] <InPhase> KombuchaKip: For example, measure someone's height, and you're not going to get a value better than a centimeter by any method, because a person's height changes on that scale just from small posture changes and other things.
[03:38:02] <InPhase> KombuchaKip: Therefore you have a big gap between the data precision of a person's height and the representational precision.
[03:40:01] <InPhase> By fundamental principles of measurement theory, there is non-zero statistical uncertainty on every single real world physical value from the set of reals obtained by measurement or calculation from measurements, which is almost every value having anything to do with the real world.  And, floats were invented specifically to deal with these.
[03:40:03] *** Quits: plastico (~plastico@neomutt/plastico) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[03:42:30] <InPhase> There is also a non-zero systematic error.  So all that matters for floating point work is that the floating point precision for calculations does not make these pre-existing fundamental statistical and systematic errors larger.  Once you accept that they exist, the methods one uses to address them are the methods of statistics, and not equality.  For example, you check to see if two values are
[03:42:36] <InPhase> within a standard deviation or an uncertainty of the mean of each other, rather than some arbitrary representational value.
[03:47:33] <InPhase> Imagine you are using floating point biometric values from an image to try to equate two identities.  You cannot do equality or almost equality.  You have to determine the distributions of values obtained by a distribution of measurements of the same person and use a statistical comparison to establish whether the new measurement is likely to be from the same population of measurements of the same
[03:47:39] <InPhase> individual.  That establishes equality.

[04:38:52] <KombuchaKip> InPhase: So I've reviewed some reading again, including revisiting RandomReader's article. I think the previous ULP approach might be better than what you proposed, but it still needs to be fixed. Working with ULPs can be more efficient on x86 where I have SIMD instructions for moving from x87 registers into an integer one (which you need to do when type punning).

For small values you need more. So basically one needs to find the curve that suits the application where X is size of an operand and Y axis is acceptable ULPs.

[04:47:30] <KombuchaKip> InPhase: Comparing via ULPs is another way of doing relative comparison.

[04:53:22] <KombuchaKip> Let me check and see what the typical ranges are when not [0,1]

[04:57:28] <InPhase> There is almost nothing a DSP touches that you should be treating in this manner.

Doing it all with integers might be faster, but a lot more complicated.
[04:59:59] <InPhase> KombuchaKip: Sure, floats.  But you don't do equalities on digital signals.
[05:00:43] <KombuchaKip> InPhase: If you are trying to perform feature normalization, you need to compare each one to some baseline to try and find, for example, a minimum or maximum value.

[05:02:03] <KombuchaKip> InPhase: It makes for interesting philosophical reading, but it doesn't help me solve the problem right now. Speaking of which, it looks like the ranges, when normalized, are always [0, 1] as discussed, and when not normalized are approximately [-100,100]. As in usually under a +/- hundred.
[05:02:29] <InPhase> And that's one way to normalize features.  A more robust method for DSP signal feature normalization is z-scoring.
[05:02:52] <InPhase> max/min normalization corrupts feature integrity by outlier noise.
[05:03:03] <KombuchaKip> InPhase: I need to do min-max normalization.
[05:03:21] <InPhase> Are you feeding this into some machine learning algorithm?
[05:04:09] *** Joins: lh_ideapad (~lh_mouse@mingw-w64/developer/lhmouse)
[05:05:10] <KombuchaKip> InPhase: Yes. And it looks like the unnormalized ranges are yet to exceed +/- 100, though it could happen. Regardless, we're talking about values that are either normalized or [0, 100] 99 % of the time. There might be the odd one that's a little over a 100, but none of the input data I've been working with has turned up that scenario yet. This gives us the orders of magnitude to consider in refactoring AlmostEquals(float, float).
[05:06:13] <InPhase> KombuchaKip: Yeah, most likely you really want z-scoring instead.  Do you have a data scientist or statistician on staff that's within NDA that you can discuss this with?
[05:06:47] <InPhase> KombuchaKip: They will understand the impact of min/max vs z-scoring on noise altering the most core learnable features of the data.

[14:26:14] <fredi> it so happens I do know the person in trouble, his code being adapted from a project he worked for in physics department
[14:27:27] <fredi> that meaning: neither has he any idea of what exactly is being done (except for differential equations regarding the movement of neutrons or whatsoever), nor would he be able to produce any MRE
[14:28:22] <fredi> yet worse, the original code being written using C (and OpenMP while we're at it), he was forced (by Mr. Advisor) to rewrite it using C++

[14:30:28] <fredi> given this context, it was suggested to him in the last couple hours, by a third party, that OpenMP tries to synchro whenever an attribution is to be performed, and somehow in his particular case, would be trying to synchronize the object as a whole rather than only the member to be attributed
[14:32:45] *** Quits: cursey_ (~cursey@user/cursey) (Quit: bye)
[14:33:21] <fredi> my single question being if that does hold or makes any sense. long ago, structs and classes had minor differences aside the whole OOPist support, yet OpenMP manages to synchro struct members alone in C whereas not with C++ classes?
[14:35:00] <TinoDidriksen> That sounds like something that's easily testable.
[14:35:47] <fredi> sort of, despite it being (supposedly) tested right now, while we're having this conversation
[14:37:31] <fredi> TinoDidriksen  it means to rewrite in such a way for the attributions to happen outside of pragma scope
[14:38:12] <fredi> but, as a matter of course, it's being done. then again, I shall read OpenMP documentation to the detail would this be proven correct

[14:48:46] <PJBoy> ah ok
[14:48:49] <TinoDidriksen> Oh. Well, profile it first then.

[14:51:06] <fredi> as for testing it with single instances (and comparing ASM), it didn't occur to me but can't do it myself since I never actually worked with OpenMP
[14:51:13] <fredi> simpler*
[14:51:57] <PJBoy> even for the C version, I would bring `e.ordQuad/2` out into its own const variable
[14:52:09] <PJBoy> and declare it as a private for the parallel for
[14:52:09] <fredi> TinoDidriksen  circa 10h ago I asked and he lacks knowledge of what profiling is, so...
[14:52:16] <fredi> I gave the same suggestion
[14:53:07] <PJBoy> if nothing else, I would slow the transition to C++ down a bit
[14:53:19] <PJBoy> the C code can work without any extra transformation in C++

[14:57:29] <fredi> whatever "getQuadOrder()" is meant to be, or to do, I agree about this as well
[14:57:55] <fredi> as for virtual methods, could be such somehow related to the performance issue?
[14:59:01] <PJBoy> if those methods are virtual, then yeah
[14:59:49] <PJBoy> virtual methods have a bit of calling overhead to look up the most derived class' implementation of that method
[14:59:51] <fredi> PJBoy  because I know for a fact outside that code fragment, the whole thing is kinda "forced" in many aspects
[15:00:07] <PJBoy> those calls get devirtualised sometimes, but it's a possibility for performance hits
[15:00:34] <fredi> including a "Master Class" having a bunch of members both virtual and/or not, just for the sake of subclasses inheritance
[15:01:55] <PJBoy> yeah we've all seen some pretty despicable C++ design protocols
[15:02:01] <fredi> a week ago, I was asked about inheriting some specific values. the issue ended up solve through upcasting.

[15:02:39] <PJBoy> though I'd say that C code looks quite nasty too

[15:03:48] <PJBoy> at a glance that looks like it does the wrong thing
[15:04:38] <fredi> as for virtual methods specifically, there are two of them entirely undefined in that big class. when I asked, he argued every subclass do implement them in their own ways but...
[15:04:40] <PJBoy> being that it's equivalent to `psiOld[n][0] = psi[n][0] = e.cce;`
[15:05:15] <PJBoy> those would be pure virtual methods
[15:06:12] <fredi> as long as none are causing said trouble
[15:06:48] <fredi> PJBoy  still, as much as the C code could look bad, it was tested beforehand
[15:07:47] <PJBoy> the other thing worth checking is that you've actually enabled openmp >_>
[15:07:50] <fredi> the assumption of smooth transition from there to C++, of course, being wrong from the start
[15:07:58] <PJBoy> like have you compared the time to the openmp disabled build?
[15:08:36] <fredi> no, but through top it was confirmed more than one instance running
[15:08:52] <PJBoy> alright
[15:09:09] <PJBoy> I think the transition of that code to C++ is smooth enough
[15:09:30] <PJBoy> but the transition from procedural code to object oriented, that's less likely to go smoothly for HPC code
[15:10:14] <fredi> you said it and it's bugging me as well: is the bottleneck even in the code fragment in that StackExchange question?
[15:10:33] <PJBoy> there's no way of knowing without a profiler
[15:10:42] <fredi> let profile alone, ltracing wouldn't do any harm
[15:11:22] <PJBoy> first I've heard of ltrace :o
[15:11:49] <PJBoy> that's cool
[15:11:59] <fredi> if OOPism is delving deeper into libraries we'd know that at least
[15:15:03] <PJBoy> yo first time using conan today
[15:16:23] <very_sneaky> PJBoy: how'd you go?
[15:16:46] <PJBoy> gone pretty smoothly so far
[15:17:09] <PJBoy> delegated the task of configuring/building openssl to conan
[15:17:15] <johnny> moo
[15:17:24] <very_sneaky> nice
[15:17:31] <johnny> PJBoy is a barbarian
[15:17:33] <PJBoy> think it's successfully cut down on build complexity
[15:17:39] <PJBoy> please no
[15:17:56] <PJBoy> every single engineer I've spoken to about conan has made reference to the film
[15:18:04] <PJBoy> that film is like twice my age
[15:18:11] <PJBoy> I'm so sick of it hahaha
[15:18:38] <johnny> so why were you building openssl?
[15:18:51] <PJBoy> dependency
[15:19:06] <very_sneaky> lol, i guess it's an easy association to make. there's actually a remote for conan that allows you to use github repos called barbarian
[15:19:15] <PJBoy> not exactly sure why we were building it from source
[15:19:19] <johnny> well are you using conan to *build* openssl? or download a precompiled version from the conan repo?
[15:19:33] <johnny> it depends on which options you choose i imagine
[15:19:49] <PJBoy> well it spat out a load of output telling me how it configured openssl and built it with gcc
[15:19:50] <very_sneaky> https://barbarian.bfgroup.xyz
[15:19:52] <johnny> i'm doing C :(
[15:20:01] <PJBoy> and openssl does need to run those perl scripts
[15:20:10] <PJBoy> so I can only imagine openssl just *has* to be built
[15:20:27] <johnny> make it stop already
[15:20:41] <very_sneaky> there would be prebuilt binaries for openssl with the default options i think
[15:20:57] <PJBoy> it has CPU specific ASM too
[15:21:17] <PJBoy> idk
[15:21:37] <PJBoy> I'm not the one writing the conan here
[15:21:47] <PJBoy> but I'll take that point onboard
[15:22:17] <PJBoy> all it has is a `[requires] openssl/3.0.0`
[15:22:37] <PJBoy> is there something extra I would need to do to ask conan to download the prebuilt binaries?
[15:22:47] <PJBoy> or will it figure that out automatically?
[15:23:02] <PJBoy> (there are some options specified too that may not be the defaults)
[15:23:46] <PJBoy> `openssl:no_idea=True`
[15:23:51] <PJBoy> :thinking_emoji:
[15:24:07] *** Joins: markong (~kvirc@213.146.188.203)
[15:24:14] <very_sneaky> should figure that out automatically, but you'd need to have everything line up for what they build for: https://conan.io/center/openssl?version=3.0.0&os=Linux&tab=configuration
[15:24:31] <very_sneaky> if you've specified options, then you wouldn't get a pre-built
[15:24:42] <PJBoy> ok so that explains that
[15:25:24] <very_sneaky> unless you're specifying an option to the default value, redundantly
[15:25:41] <PJBoy> can confirm that we're not using any of those prebuilt configs
[15:25:45] <PJBoy> so yeah that'd be it
[15:26:30] <PJBoy> legend has it that conan allows for hosting binaries on a private server though
[15:26:33] <very_sneaky> if you host your own artifactory server (free), you can push binaries up so that you don't have to rebuild for your specific configurations
[15:26:37] <PJBoy> nice
[15:27:22] <PJBoy> artifactory = binary right?
[15:27:35] <PJBoy> or binary + supporting metadata
[15:27:41] <very_sneaky> anything
[15:27:57] <very_sneaky> you can put source, binary, non C++ files up there too
[15:28:03] <PJBoy> oh right
[15:28:22] <very_sneaky> the free version only supports conan packages, but enterprise supports a bunch of other package managers for different langauges too - pypi, npm etc
[15:28:39] <very_sneaky> free version supports conan and generic packages *
[15:28:56] <very_sneaky> so if you want to store tarballs or whatever you can
[15:29:16] * Haohmaru is inventing a lossless data compression/decompression algorithm.. tighten your seatbelts
[15:29:23] <PJBoy> is conan offering servers for their artifacts?

[15:30:40] <PJBoy> but what if jfrog log my artifacts D:
[15:32:49] <very_sneaky> https://jfrog.com/start-free jeez that's not great marketing
[15:33:15] <very_sneaky> hard to find and not clear that it's artifactory, but yeah - i think it includes some devops tools as well
[15:33:59] <PJBoy> to be fair
[15:34:41] <very_sneaky> so, artifactory as a program was recently accepted into iron bank - the dod "hardened" docker container repository. I would imagine they would be in a bit of a bind if they were caught inspecting user resources
[15:34:47] <PJBoy> I searched jfrog and got https://puu.sh/IxsB6/ab7e3fba89.png
[15:35:45] <PJBoy> ah this is the first I've heard of iron bank
[15:35:51] <very_sneaky> yeah, i found the marketing on their page to be a bit confusing - it wasn't clear what was artifactory on the cloud and what wasn't
[15:36:15] <very_sneaky> turns out they bundle everything in
[15:38:17] <PJBoy> so currently we're running `conan install ...; cmake -G ...`
[15:38:36] <PJBoy> does it make any sense to try and put that conan invocation into the cmake script instead?
[15:39:09] <very_sneaky> that's probably a design question to think about. I'm not sure - it feels like a chicken and egg problem
[15:39:16] <very_sneaky> you can specify cmake in conan as a build requirement
[15:39:27] <very_sneaky> so conan will grab cmake if it doesn't exist
[15:39:40] <PJBoy> omg
[15:39:44] <PJBoy> that's news to me haha
[15:40:02] <PJBoy> I wanna try that
[15:40:18] <PJBoy> although cmake is a hard requirement to be preinstalled in other places
[15:40:22] <PJBoy> so meg
[15:40:24] <PJBoy> *meh
[15:41:39] <very_sneaky> atm with a conanfile.py in my project root, i'm using `conan install . --build-folder=build --build=missing; conan build . --build-folder=build -cb` to grab and build everything
[15:41:52] <very_sneaky> and then `conan build . --build-folder=build -t` to run unit tests
[15:42:33] <Haohmaru> so i guess this counts as RLE .. input is 8bit bytes (it's not text, it's a 1bit digital signal), i encode it as 8bit bytes by simply putting a value (0 or 1) at the top bit, and then the other 7bits form a 7bit uint of how many times this bit value happens.. so 0x00 is encoded as "0 8" or 0x08, 0xFFFF would encoded as "1 16" ...
[15:42:37] <Haohmaru> sounds sane?
[15:43:21] <PJBoy> gotcha
[15:46:57] <PJBoy> that means making a conanfile.py then
[15:47:49] <very_sneaky> yeah i guess so. I think you can only use conanfile.txt if you're a consumer of third party libs
[15:47:57] <very_sneaky> conanfile.py allows you to package your project up
[15:48:34] <PJBoy> conan throws me a "ERROR: Conanfile not found at /blahblah/conanfile.py" when I try to run conan build otherwise
[15:49:29] <very_sneaky> yeah that makes sense. Pretty sure you need to define `build()` with instructions on how to invoke cmake
[15:51:49] <very_sneaky> if you need an example, this is a recipe i wrote for cci: https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/blob/2610781460b765058c7fd1d3392be532da3bf0d7/recipes/armadillo/all/conanfile.py#L253

[15:54:41] <very_sneaky> yeah i thought it was pretty straight forward when going through the process
[16:03:18] <PJBoy> right is there anything I need to do for conan to use clang?
[16:03:31] <very_sneaky> just set up a profile
[16:04:06] <PJBoy> ok that's easy
[16:04:08] <PJBoy> thanks
[16:04:50] <very_sneaky> protip is to add CC, CXX and FC env vars to your profiles.. i've found it helps to reduce errors
[16:05:08] <very_sneaky> FC if you're building anything that may depend on fortran - blas, lapack etc
[16:06:48] <PJBoy> the profile my coworker set up for our ARM build has CC and CCX env vars :D
[16:07:08] <PJBoy> I assume that's completely essential for cmake to work
[16:07:48] <very_sneaky> i think if you don't set it, it will look on the path, but i had some weird issues where it would try to use gcc instead of clang in some circumstances
[16:08:12] <very_sneaky> also, if you're building ARM, there's nothing on CCI pre-built for that. they only have x86_64 prebuilt binaries
[16:09:02] <PJBoy> we have a specific ARM toolchain anyway
[16:09:22] <PJBoy> well
[16:09:32] <PJBoy> various specific ARM toolchains from various vendors
[16:09:43] <PJBoy> so there was never any chance of CCI having this stuff
[16:10:29] <very_sneaky> fair
[16:17:12] <PJBoy> alright switching to clang was a great success
[16:17:18] <PJBoy> very happy with this experience so far
[16:17:59] <very_sneaky> :)
[16:18:36] <very_sneaky> i've been watching a lot of packaging talks recently because we're in the process of moving from a bespoke build system to something open source, and transitioning to a package manager from nothing
[16:19:05] <PJBoy> same!
[16:19:06] <very_sneaky> I'm coming around to the idea that build recipe's should be completely agnostic to the package manager wherever possible because then you don't need to care where it's packaged
[16:19:18] <PJBoy> (except without the watching talks bit)
[16:19:47] <very_sneaky> lol exciting - are you doing an evaluation of a bunch of different ones or just going for the most adopted?
[16:20:03] <PJBoy> diving straight into cmake and conan
[16:20:14] <PJBoy> due to sheer enthusiasm of me and this other guy haha
[16:20:36] <very_sneaky> yeah i think that's where we're gonna land but i feel like i need to do some due diligence given the excitement around meson

[16:21:49] <very_sneaky> you'll be happy to hear that I've just been through the process of setting up a ci pipeline for automatic package builds/deployment to artifactory - works super easy. the conan team actually provide all of their packaging tools and docker images that they use for cci
[16:22:28] <very_sneaky> we have on-prem artifactory for all of our existing itnernal package management for other languages already
[16:22:41] <very_sneaky> i have one at home for testing
[16:22:45] <PJBoy> bruh
[16:23:02] <PJBoy> so devs will be able to get the latest builds
[16:23:11] <PJBoy> *without needing to build*
[16:23:16] <very_sneaky> yeah, exactly
[16:23:38] <PJBoy> sounds too good to be true <3
[16:23:38] <very_sneaky> the other thing i'm excited for is dependency resolution lol
[16:23:57] <Haohmaru> do i really have to use printf() to get "0F" printed from 0x0F >:/
[16:24:14] <Haohmaru> .. instead of 'f'
[16:24:16] <PJBoy> dependencies and configuring for those dependencies was the main motivation for cmake in the first place
[16:24:16] <very_sneaky> at the moment we have a hornets nest of doing the dance with existing prebuilt binaries hoping one will work with the others, if you don't want to spend an hour rebuilding
[16:24:23] <PJBoy> << uppercase << hex << 0xF
[16:24:24] <geordi> F
[16:24:35] <PJBoy> << uppercase << hex << setfill('0') << setw(2) << 0xF
[16:24:36] <geordi> 0F
[16:24:43] <Haohmaru> wowz
[16:25:28] <PJBoy> I, for one, hate dancing entirely
[16:25:38] <PJBoy> I would probably opt to do the hour rebuild every time
[16:25:46] <Haohmaru> thanks PJBoy
[16:26:06] <PJBoy> that setw needs to be done for every number you output
[16:26:20] <PJBoy> but the other effects last until you unset them
[16:26:21] <very_sneaky> we have users of the binaries who aren't involved in developing the code, so don't know how to build things, which is a bit of an abnormality i think
[16:26:48] <very_sneaky> but yeah i tend to rebuild as well - fortunately i don't need to do it often
[16:26:50] <PJBoy> building code is hard haha
[16:26:57] <PJBoy> it's hard enough for developers
[16:27:12] <PJBoy> I spent all of yesterday trying to build python 3.6
[16:27:15] <very_sneaky> sometimes i forget how hard simple things are
[16:27:17] <PJBoy> and to no avail
[16:27:32] <very_sneaky> i've been trying to teach git to people in my team

[16:27:55] <very_sneaky> it's an uphill battle but getting there
[16:28:15] <very_sneaky> building c++ is a step beyond that i think
[16:28:25] <PJBoy> git is even harder to use than build systems
[16:28:34] <very_sneaky> you think? there's like 6 commands
[16:28:44] <very_sneaky> i think the mental model is easier

[16:34:49] <very_sneaky> they do have a big green button that says "Get code" though, and allows you to download as a zip or tarball
[16:34:55] <PJBoy> but there's never any hyphens in any practical context
[16:35:34] <PJBoy> they do actually provide the git clone command on github don't they?
[16:35:35] <very_sneaky> yeah true. that does confuse me too. recently i was confused when downloading git-filter-repo

[16:36:04] <PJBoy> ah they do not
[16:36:26] <PJBoy> ugh, why does github have their own CLI
[16:36:29] <very_sneaky> ah, it does just say `Code`
[16:36:45] <PJBoy> they could have used that tab for the actual git command
[16:37:40] <PJBoy> oh and git on windows is even more work
[16:37:50] <PJBoy> actually nah not for read-only purposes
[16:38:04] <very_sneaky> yeah probably. tbf though, it's probably not a bad gate to have. if you don't know how to use git to get files, you shoudln't be downloading and executing arbitrary code anyway
[16:38:10] <PJBoy> but for read-write purposes, you gotta set up pageant
[16:38:23] <very_sneaky> pageant?
[16:38:42] <PJBoy> it handles private keys
[16:38:45] <very_sneaky> i've just downloaded git-for-windows or msys2, which gives you a bash shell

[21:18:46] <PJBoy> sounds like ant colony
[21:18:54] <rpav> std:::y
[21:18:55] <PJBoy> which is a form of AI
[21:19:11] <PJBoy> which std::hive has nothing to do with

[21:20:28] <rpav> just sounds like "we get to name new data structures not you" to me
[21:20:33] <rpav> e.g. https://plflib.org/colony.htm
[21:21:10] <PJBoy> something tells me that plf::colony has never once been used to represent a colony of anything
[21:21:15] <rpav> i see such is even the reference implementation
[21:21:20] <RandomReader> no, it's just inappropriate inspiration relative to the existing style of stdlib

[21:21:31] <rpav> also the hilarity of the c++ committee considering something poorly-named
[21:21:50] <PJBoy> compared to the other containers, colony and hive are both awful
[21:22:04] <RandomReader> it's not a container name, it's a brand name
[21:22:06] <PJBoy> you would never in a thousand years guess what they're good for

[21:25:41] <markong> > also "vector" is poor vs its mathematical meaning <--- indeed!
[21:26:14] <PJBoy> the term "vector" for a vector of arbitrary data appears in several other programming language predating C
[21:26:27] <rpav> it doesn't matter

[21:26:56] <PJBoy> nah it's confirmed vector

[21:28:54] <PJBoy> I highly doubt hive is going to enter anyone's vocabulary either
[21:29:03] <rpav> you can get lighter-weight and faster
[21:29:12] <xkoncek> i just downloaded it, it doesn't have a insert function which accepts iterator
[21:29:16] <rpav> though plf::colony wasn't very std-worthy as implemented either
[21:29:19] <rpav> yeah

[21:29:58] <rpav> it needed a _lot_ of polish on top of it so i just wrote a similar thing .. deque is probably decent out-of-the-box std block storage though
[21:30:00] <RandomReader> (and I hate the "array list" pair, there's just precedent for that term)
[21:30:10] <Alipha> unordered multiset with no fast lookup?
[21:30:17] <RandomReader> not unique
[21:30:25] <RandomReader> or keyed
[21:30:33] <kalven> deque is famously poor on some stdlib implementations
[21:30:58] <PJBoy> it's a bucket list
[21:31:09] <Alipha> my wife says my deque is poor
[21:31:16] <xkoncek> afaik, you can throw values inside, keep iterators and erase them later, that is the use case
[21:31:36] <xkoncek> no order guarantees, but iterators are stable
[21:31:38] <PJBoy> well if your deque is double ended, you can go fuck yourself
[21:31:38] <rpav> Alipha: colony should be O(1) lookup for an index or pointer
[21:31:39] <Alipha> xkoncek: so, std::set? heh
[21:31:40] <xkoncek> i think
[21:31:58] <kalven> set is ordered
[21:31:59] <rpav> more like "sparse array"
[21:32:09] <xkoncek> i think... more/less, but the implementation is block-based
[21:32:21] <PJBoy> the proposal gives
[21:32:23] <PJBoy> > Hive is a formalisation, extension and optimization of what is typically known as a 'bucket array' container in game programming circles
[21:32:37] <Alipha> std::bucket_array
[21:32:45] <RandomReader> "array" has specific meaning in C++ though, so that alone wouldn't fit
[21:32:48] <PJBoy> the "typical name" is way way way better than the atypical brand name

[21:33:06] <RandomReader> it'd have to act contiguously to have "array" in the name

[21:33:24] <RandomReader> how does "bucket" imply linked list?
[21:33:27] <PJBoy> array doesn't mean all that much
[21:33:36] <PJBoy> valarray is a term already
[21:33:40] <RandomReader> "array" in C++ is always used in "contiguous container" terms
[21:33:57] <rpav> because it's been used tangentially for that by someone for hash table buckets at some point, so this qualifies it by prior rules as the definitive, absolute, culturally-ingrained meaning ;)
[21:34:05] <PJBoy> and valarray isn't necessarily contiguous
[21:34:15] <PJBoy> it can have strides or whatever
[21:34:31] <PJBoy> in fact it has weak enough complexity guarantees that it could probably be deque under the hood
[21:34:36] <RandomReader> those are on the operations, not the valarray itself, no?
[21:34:44] <RandomReader> as in the strides apply to the operational layers like slice
[21:34:51] <PJBoy> well it's not specified
[21:34:53] <xkoncek> valarray was in veryy early c++

[21:40:16] <PJBoy> hence bucket_array is all good
[21:40:16] <nolyc> Haohmaru: An object of class type can also be initialized by a braced-init-list.
[21:40:32] <RandomReader> it is, it's a "g slice of an array"
[21:40:36] <RandomReader> it's not "a kind of array"
[21:41:38] <PJBoy> can you make the same logic for std::indirect_array?
[21:42:28] <PJBoy> tbh, I'm starting to see the trend of "xxx_array" being names that belong with std::valarray

[21:44:57] <RandomReader> the standard doesn't seem to describe it as an "array" either though, that just appears in its name
[21:45:41] <PJBoy> it's an "indirect[ion to val]array"
[21:45:54] <RandomReader> it also has no interface that's remotely array-like, it's just bulk assignment
[21:46:11] <RandomReader> yeah, weird one, I hadn't seen it before
[21:46:19] <RandomReader> anyway
[21:46:36] <RandomReader> does "list" imply ordering?
[21:46:48] <PJBoy> std::list isn't ordered
[21:46:53] <RandomReader> colony/hive is associative-like in plain insertion, since it can go randomly
[21:46:59] <RandomReader> it is in the sense that you control the order
[21:47:21] <RandomReader> oh, sorry, I mean in programmer-interface terms
[21:47:29] <imMute> "ordered by the order you insert items"
[21:47:29] <RandomReader> not in the key-sorted sense

[21:50:16] <RandomReader> hm, I wonder if there's any lexical ordering there
[21:51:07] <PJBoy> does set imply ordering to you?
[21:51:19] <PJBoy> 'cause then I could bring up how bitset exists
[21:51:31] <PJBoy> which is actually more of a bitarray
[21:51:48] <PJBoy> although those bits aren't contiguous in the contiguous_iterator sense
[21:53:21] <PJBoy> what about unordered_list

[21:54:17] <RandomReader> I thought about that earlier, I wonder if it's not descriptive enough, but otherwise...
[21:54:40] <PJBoy> confirmed better name than hive then
[21:54:49] <PJBoy> because it's non-zero in its descriptiveness
[21:55:00] <RandomReader> the paper talks about push_back but doesn't specify it, I'm not clear if that's supposed to be a thing or not
[21:55:34] <PJBoy> closest I think you get to the buckets is via std::hive_limits
[21:56:32] <PJBoy> I just noticed it has a std::hive_priority
[21:56:40] <RandomReader> "the proposal for unordered_bitset has been rejected due to being too trivial"
[21:56:46] <PJBoy> as part of its class template
[21:57:23] <PJBoy> it specifies that it has two values `performance` and `memory_use`, but otherwise doesn't say anything about them
[21:57:44] <RandomReader> "unspecified" :D
[21:58:07] <PJBoy> oh no, found it
[21:58:26] <PJBoy> > if set to priority::memory_use this is a non-binding request to prioritize lowered memory usage over container performance
[21:58:46] <PJBoy> and priority::performance is unspecified
