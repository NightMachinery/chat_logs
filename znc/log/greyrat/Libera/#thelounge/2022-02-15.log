[00:12:09] <MaxLeiter> WIP 4.3.1 changelog*
[00:13:10] <MaxLeiter> some of our renovate changes broke the changelog script for renovate PRs, johncs/bookworm
[00:15:02] <williamboman> MaxLeiter: Would it make sense to add thelounge-docker et al. notifications to this channel? We had it on the Freenode channel
[00:16:02] <MaxLeiter> Yeah
[00:16:37] <val> some of the PR numbers are missing a link
[00:16:43] <MaxLeiter> launchd: could you add https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-docker, https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-deb/, and https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge.github.io?
[00:16:50] <MaxLeiter> val: yeah fixing 
[00:17:02] <val> and you probably want to link https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/pull/4466 instead of the commit directly

[00:18:42] * xnaas just had to talk shit
[00:19:35] <MaxLeiter> val: thats the renovate changes I mentioned above
[00:19:43] <MaxLeiter> and I cant be bothered to manually fix each one, so thatll be fixed when the script is
[00:20:14] <MaxLeiter> (it has the PR numbers, its just prioritizing the commit and I haven't looked at the script in a while so I can't recall why) 
[00:21:18] <MaxLeiter> sorry, the issue isnt just renovate, but I assume its the same problem 
[00:24:49] <val> ack
[00:25:10] <MaxLeiter> val: just saw https://github.com/progval/irctest/pull/132, very cool 
[00:25:45] <mou> this reminds me to ask for a feature to shorten the default file upload URL's
[00:25:59] <mou> for like a 5-10 user system they are a bit long imho :)
[00:26:50] <val> you'll find it less cool when I use it to find weird edge cases nitpicking on specifications' wording :p

[00:30:36] <val> heh
[00:31:23] <bookworm> also, sorry for not having reviewed your work... been a busy weekend
[00:31:33] <val> fosdem?
[00:31:39] <val> no worries
[00:31:48] <bookworm> learning to drive 😅

[00:32:05] <val> for a whole week-end? sounds exhausting
[00:32:37] <val> driving merely for an hour wore me out
[00:32:46] <bookworm> well, that plus family dinner plus other things
[00:33:29] <val> unrelated: is there a way to make The Lounge whitelist some TLS fingerprints and/or use a custom CA?
[00:33:36] <bookworm> not yet
[00:33:57] <bookworm> feature should probably be a cert FP that's whitelisted I think
[00:34:25] <bookworm> also avoids the insecure icon for self signed certs etc and is better than just turning the warning off
[00:34:59] <bookworm> as for custom CA, that's easy, just add it to the cert store of your system
[00:35:13] <bookworm> I think node also has an env var for additional CAs
[00:35:31] <bookworm> but you can't tell a newbie to install a system CA, they won't get how
[00:35:45] <bookworm> so a more user friendly feature might be nicer
[00:35:58] <bookworm> (no offense intended, I'd need to look it up as well)
[00:36:31] <bookworm> some magic dir + ca-update and some such, least on debian like systems
[00:36:34] <val> I'm just asking this because irctest can't change the system's store :p

[00:37:33] <bookworm> open up an issue please if it doesn't yet exist, although that'd surprise me
[00:37:37] <val> though I'm not sure it's a good idea to make it too easy to add a trusted cert. it may be easy to abuse
[00:37:48] <bookworm> didn't hurt znc
[00:37:49] <val> s/trusted cert/trusted CA/
[00:37:59] <bookworm> ah, not CA, cert FP
[00:38:05] <val> yeah sure
[00:38:16] <bookworm> TL will never mess with the system CA store over my dead body
[00:38:28] <bookworm> (missing a comma)
[00:38:40] <val> yeah of course, I meant adding a trusted CA to TL's process
[00:38:50] <bookworm> I wouldn't do a full Ca
[00:38:57] <bookworm> just a single cert FP
[00:39:05] <bookworm> meaning TOFU essentially
[00:39:11] <val> actually you'd need more than one, for RR networks
[00:39:16] <bookworm> RR?
[00:39:21] <val> round-robin
[00:39:30] <bookworm> ah, right. Shit
[00:39:41] <val> eg. a network I'm not can't get all its server operators to switch to Let's Encrypt, so they have to do this: https://www.rezosup.net/tls.php
[00:39:58] <val> s/I'm not/I'm on/
[00:40:09] <bookworm> I see
[00:40:38] <val> oooh, they mention they use DANE, could be a cool (but somewhat useless feature) for TL :p

[00:55:31] <val> why do they always leave before we have time to reply
[00:56:52] <xnaas> Everyone forgets that the I in IRC stands for Idle ;P
[00:56:53] <bookworm> I still don't understand why people think that *sets* a password
[00:57:04] <bookworm> it *uses* a password to join
[00:57:12] <bookworm> not the same thing
[00:57:42] <xnaas> I think they're mistaking + next to a server name for creating a channel in general. Which, a channel does get created if no one is in it, but... :P
[00:57:55] <val> xnaas: ooh, good point
[00:58:00] <xnaas> they're thinking too modern
[00:58:03] <xnaas> 😅
[00:58:41] <xnaas> I don't know that there's really a universal "join" icon you could use to better convey the usage, though.
[00:58:49] <bookworm> not sure we should even attempt to set a password

[00:59:37] <bookworm> well, I can just rename the label "join password" and make a tooltip using more words
[00:59:47] <bookworm> not sure that'll help though
[00:59:58] <xnaas> might help 1 person
[00:59:58] <bookworm> but that came up at least once before

[01:04:30] <xnaas> On the plus side, I've been able to use The Lounge as a lesson to people to fuckin' turn off autofill
[01:04:42] <xnaas> people kept adding their own nicks to the highlight exceptions field lol
[01:04:48] <bookworm> I *want* people to autofill passwords
[01:04:49] <xnaas> (because of autofill)
[01:04:52] <bookworm> that's a good thing
[01:05:28] <xnaas> auto vs auto on page load
[01:05:35] <xnaas> the latter being bad, imo
[01:05:43] <bookworm> and the highlight exception should be fixed, there I've added the hint
[01:07:01] <xnaas> Was that shipped in 4.3.0?
[01:07:50] *** Quits: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c) (Client Quit)
[01:08:00] <bookworm> yes
[01:08:16] <xnaas> nice.
[01:08:30] <bookworm> we don't really do backports. A release is essentially  master at a specific point in time
[01:08:56] <bookworm> (enough work as is)
[01:09:28] <xnaas> Sure, just didn't know if you meant "already added a long time ago" (4.3.0) or "just added it yesterday" :P

[18:42:20] <loungebeginner01> i managed to login 
[18:42:23] <loungebeginner01> so what next?
[18:42:52] <loungebeginner01> do i need to start the thelounge everytime i switch on my pi?
[18:43:08] <bookworm> if you want to use TL, naturally
[18:43:25] <bookworm> if the question is actually if you can automatically do that on boot, yes
[18:43:31] <loungebeginner01> can it autostart?
[18:43:33] <loungebeginner01> yea 
[18:43:46] <bookworm> how did you finally install TL?
[18:43:50] <val> it does autostart
[18:43:50] <loungebeginner01> i want to keep it on 24/7.

[18:49:36] <bookworm> no

[18:50:21] <loungebeginner01> maybe it took time

[18:51:15] <loungebeginner01> ok, so I plant to keep this pi in some other place with 24/7 access to electricity and internet
[18:51:31] <val> are you sure you ran "sudo systemctl enable --now thelounge" ?
[18:51:38] <loungebeginner01> yes i did
[18:51:42] <loungebeginner01> first i stopped

[18:58:48] <val> you can ignore that one for now
[18:58:53] <loungebeginner01> yeah ok
[18:58:56] <val> it just means you won't have message history
[18:59:06] <loungebeginner01> ohh

[19:00:15] <val> ah, nic
[19:00:17] <loungebeginner01> i would like to have the history, it means the chat log when i was away, right?
[19:00:28] <loungebeginner01> but before that 
[19:00:43] <loungebeginner01> i want to access my pi from a different network
[19:01:00] <loungebeginner01> i couldnt do it before so i dropped the idea, but now I want to try again
[19:01:17] <val> you need to open the port in your router
[19:01:38] <val> how to do it depends on what router (and/or ISP) you have, so I can't help you with that
[19:02:13] <loungebeginner> understood
[19:02:32] <xnaas> SQLite is just for persistent history. Meaning: without it, if you restart The Lounge, then you have no message history.
[19:02:48] <loungebeginner> port mapping?
[19:02:54] <xnaas> You also can't search message backlogs with the /search command, I suppose.
[19:03:06] <val> maybe
[19:03:19] <loungebeginner> yes you are right xnaas

[19:05:51] <loungebeginner01> but i also dont have static ip
[19:06:29] <bookworm> your in for a rather complicated topic... but that's getting out of scope of this channel
[19:06:37] <xnaas> Technically you could set the WAN port to anything, but the LAN port needs to be 9000 because that's what The Lounge is using. You'll also need to set a static IP on the Pi, yes.
[19:06:38] <loungebeginner01> i understand sorry
[19:06:41] <val> your ipv6 address might be static
[19:06:49] <loungebeginner01> i will leave it for now 
[19:07:06] <val> else you can look into solutions like dyndns or a VPN (the real kind, not glorified proxies)
[19:07:11] <bookworm> have a look at dynamic dns, https://duckdns.org say
[19:07:15] <val> but it does get harder indeed
[19:07:19] <loungebeginner01> i did used duckdns last time

[22:18:00] <landen> hey guys. i'm attempting to deploy my own fork of thelounge, by forking the thelounge-docker and trying to point everything to my own repo. it's failing to build the client app. this is well beyond my scope of knowledge, so I'm wondering if anyone has an example of something similar that I could look at—an example of deploying a fork of thelounge
[22:18:00] <landen> with docker.
[22:20:17] <landen> alternatively, here's my fork of thelounge-docker, in case i'm close. although i'm getting the feeling that I'm completely lost. github.com/landendanyluk/thelounge-docker
[22:22:19] <xnaas> I don't know if that's how yarn works (changing a package name to a github link) — personally, I just stole some of williamboman's work with https://github.com/xnaas/docker-thelounge (he's in the git history) — that would be fairly easy to point to an alternative git repo than official, I think.
[22:23:19] <xnaas> https://github.com/williamboman/thelounge-docker-from-source was the source with no license, so 😅
[22:27:52] <landen> well this looks promising. i'll try it out, thanks for the reply

[23:17:21] <val> specifically, this makes the storage of ident and host constant-size (they are stored as a slice of a string that is already interned by some other attribute) instead of keeping a copy of data.ident + "@" + data.hostname, at the cost of some overhead; and 56 bytes is the break-off point

[23:28:18] <bookworm> that seems .. not worth it
[23:29:33] <bookworm> although I don't quite comprehend why the two individual fields are concatenated when you had them nicely parsed
[23:29:59] <bookworm> just keeping them separate until you display it seems a better choice
[23:30:27] <val> 🤷

[23:31:33] <bookworm> arguing about size and storage layout in js land however is a bit challenging... considering that the spec of the language makes no guarantees whatsoever
[23:32:00] <val> well I'm profiling on whatever old version of v8 Debian ships
[23:32:05] <val> nodejs *
[23:32:07] <bookworm> and in essence all you get is some specific v8 version at some point in time when you ...
[23:32:09] <bookworm> yes, that
[23:32:40] <bookworm> however I wouldn't try to optimize too much for that
[23:32:54] <val> I think storing messages as strings instead of objects may be worth it in general
[23:32:59] <val> but that's trading memory for cpu
[23:33:44] <bookworm> I wouldn't do that, that would mean constantly re parsing for no good reason. Or do you mean in the db only?
[23:34:01] <bookworm> but even then, now you need to reparse messages and you loose information
[23:34:01] <val> that's what I meant by cpu
[23:34:06] <val> and no, I mean the in-mem structure
[23:34:22] <bookworm> god no, that would make the code horrible no?
[23:34:29] <val> little bit
[23:34:45] <bookworm> we should clean the code up, not make it worse
[23:35:05] <val> :(
[23:35:27] <bookworm> why are you even playing with that idea?
[23:36:19] <val> I'd like to reduce the overall memory usage
[23:36:46] <shadoozo> wouldn't reducing msgs in memory be way more effective? 
[23:36:54] <shadoozo> and... easier
[23:37:04] <bookworm> you get that by loading less things into RAM, not by getting rid of parsed messages
[23:37:06] <val> and Msg objects are about three quarters of the total usage when running with 100 users with 20 channels each
[23:37:20] <val> (and no message at all in their history besides them joining)
[23:38:11] <val> shadoozo: yeah but even in my scenario, the lounge uses 150 to 250MB of memory
[23:38:41] <shadoozo> so... 1.5mb to 2.5mb per user?
[23:38:54] <val> yes, and it's not even storing any PRIVMSG at this point
[23:39:30] <val> only an average of 50 join messages per user
[23:39:38] <val> er
[23:39:50] <val> 1000 join messages *
[23:40:01] <bookworm> let's first try to remove double buffering and constant copying prior to saving things as a plain string
[23:40:32] <val> I happen to have some unstaged changes to remove a copy from irc-framework
[23:40:52] *** Joins: Fjord8 (~Fjord@c-73-14-198-35.hsd1.co.comcast.net)
[23:40:52] <val> (but it may be optimized out in newer versions of v8 already)
[23:41:04] <shadoozo> I run with ~185MiB with a server with just myself :P

[23:43:53] <val> oh nvm, my "optimization" on irc-framework doesn't actually change anything :(
[23:44:07] <val> well anyway
[23:44:26] <val> the best solution to the in-memory size of messages may simply be to use zram
[23:45:39] <bookworm> I mean ram usage is going up, not down just by virtue of message tags
[23:45:56] <bookworm> and you and the others are happily adding more to the mix ;P

[23:49:54] <bookworm> ah right, his bouncer stuff is new commands right?
[23:50:28] <val> ah, yes
[23:50:50] <bookworm> having clients synchronize read state sounds *really* nice
[23:51:21] <val> I dream of a day The Lounge and Quassel can get rid of their custom internal protocols
[23:51:31] <val> and speak native IRC between "core" and client
[23:53:27] <val> anyway, I give up on the memory optimization
[23:53:48] <val> I used up all the tricks I usually try in python, it turns out v8 already does most of them automatically D:
[23:54:16] <val> short of changing the actual structure of objects in memory
[23:54:42] <bookworm> If I look at some of the patterns (slice, reverse, using effing arrays and PUSHING THINGS TO THE FRONT) makes my head hurt
[23:55:37] <bookworm> I still think a list should work like an array and not like a hashmap, based on every other language that actually differentiates the two
[23:55:53] <bookworm> can't do that in js...
