[04:03:21] <kline> you need it to ensure you get an idle time listed
[04:05:48] <mjt> kline: interesting. is that so clients doing whois in the background don't spam bandwidth? I can't think of any other reason
[04:06:04] <kline> i think theres more info in the help for whois
[04:06:16] <kline> but basically yes, but probably not for the reason you think
[04:07:17] <kline> /quote help whois
[04:07:56] <Church> Ah nothing like ordering books, going to shelve them and realizing I have copies already heh
[04:08:10] <kline> it does allude to it but you probably need a bit more info: idle time isnt information thats replicated across the network, local servers only know the idle time for their locally connected client. if you need to know the idle time of a user on a remote server, you need to explicitly ask that remote server
[04:08:58] <kline> things like remote whois by definition bypass any local state so generate a server to server request and thats expensive (since a server only has one link down that path to the other server but many thousands of users)
[04:09:33] <mjt> that was not the reason I was thinking
[04:11:12] <kline> you were thinking server to client having to send a line or two less?

[14:48:03] <amazigh> re bumble, lol, that is what scared me with my previous employer
[14:52:54] <ignaloidas> I've heard enough stuff about such things happening that it's the first thing I check in a contract
[14:53:43] <amazigh> ignaloidas: so you ask to remove the clause?
[14:53:57] <amazigh> I mean it was part of very single contract I signed so far.
[14:54:06] <amazigh> s/veryevery
[14:54:10] <amazigh> s/very/every/
[14:54:20] <pe> It seems to me like an American thing.
[14:54:28] <ignaloidas> haven't encountered it yet, but that will definetly be the case if I will
[14:54:44] <pe> Google definitely does this.
[14:54:50] <amazigh> my last employer claimed twitter ip
[14:54:59] <amazigh> linkedin etc..
[14:55:12] <amazigh> instagram ffs
[14:57:06] <amazigh> and they played the "we are the good people" card everywhere, and everytime.

[15:04:43] <epilys> you ask them to remove the clause yeah
[15:04:54] <epilys> first check if it's even legal in your jurisdiction
[15:05:27] <epilys> then again they might still reject that.. I had a California startup reject removing a non compete clause even though they are illegal in California and I told them
[15:05:39] <epilys> the response was "it's standard for startups, investors expect that"
[15:08:34] <letoram> I've had startups act like that before -- when they didn't accept removing it I went fine, added an enforcement clause that on termination they could opt to enforce the non-compete with full payment for as long as they wanted that enforced up to a boundary of n months.
[15:08:58] <letoram> one did enforce it, got 6 months of sitting on my ass getting payed.
[15:09:18] <epilys> oh wow nice
[15:09:29] <epilys> of course in my case it was non-paid
[15:09:43] <epilys> 12 months....
[15:10:26] <letoram> if they expect me to not work, I expected to be compensated for that service. Even then they'd have to define what I would refrain from working on.
