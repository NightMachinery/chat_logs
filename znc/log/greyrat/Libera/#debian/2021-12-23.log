[02:00:00] <dvs> does penguin computers still exist?

[03:43:06] <ws2k3> i managed to remove it. did the zero-superblock tryed to readd it but the same error came
[03:43:33] <rudi_s> `mdadm --remove detached` should do it.
[03:44:04] <ws2k3> rudi_s: ran that command. removed drive is still there
[03:44:36] <ws2k3> also did mdadm /dev/md127 --remove failed drive is still there
[03:44:43] <Blondie101010> soon you won't have other options than to force a rebuild (assemble), and it will likely work

[03:47:04] <rudi_s> ws2k3: Hm, I'd try stopping and assembling the raid.
[03:47:12] <rudi_s> No need to remove the spare because it's already a spare.

[03:48:08] <rudi_s> This is not an issue. The problem is that the removed disk is still considered part of the raid and thus the spare is not used.

[03:59:12] <rudi_s> ws2k3: Hm, I'm confused. I just recreated your scenario and when I add a new disk to the raid it replaces the "removed" disk and starts using it as spare and rebuilds the missing disk.
[03:59:52] <Blondie101010> it's because it was not failed
[03:59:57] <ws2k3> rudi_s: maybe because the state my array is active,degraded,Not Started
[04:00:39] <rudi_s> Blondie101010: No, it was listed as "removed" in my case as well.
[04:01:25] <rudi_s> ws2k3: Oh, then you'll have to stop it first. mdadm --stop and then mdadm --assemble --run /your/disks/here

[04:02:32] <rudi_s> Please don't suggest dangerous options which are not necessary!
[04:03:19] <rudi_s> If it's "Not Started" then mdadm AFAIK won't start a recovery.

[04:09:12] <rudi_s> ws2k3: FYI I cannot reproduce your exact setup. I can either get it as "Inactive" which is not yet assembled or "clean, degraded" with the "removed" disk which automatically starts the resync once I add another disk.
[04:09:51] <rudi_s> I'm not sure how you get "Not started" (I confused this with "Inactive", but this means the RAID is not assembled yet so it's not useful).

[09:23:30] <Affliction> Though I assume you're not asking about something quite so trivial
[09:24:57] <foxbox> Affliction: what if I make a math language in which numbers are treated like integers until they defined as variables at which point they are evaluated as their definition in an equation so therefor `2+2` might not always equal 4
[09:26:13] <Affliction> heh
[09:27:48] <foxbox> in the C-style arbitrary precision calculator you cannot define an integer or float as a variable name

[11:00:29] <Psy-Q> rudi_s: thanks, i checked the maintainer guide as well and it still mentions only cronjobs, so i'm guessing that'll remain the default for packages as well for the foreseeable future
[11:00:35] <ede> would make sense there i guess
[11:01:10] <Psy-Q> but if packages expect cron to be there that won't fly, and at any rate the info i was given was simply wrong :)

[14:59:27] <jcbjoe2021> eyeoh: why do you like DuckDuckGo instead of google?
[14:59:35] <eyeoh> because of the !bangs feature
[14:59:51] <eyeoh> I know it'll take me to exactly the results page I want
[15:00:28] <eyeoh> e.g., https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%21deb+tmux&t=h_
[15:00:33] <eyeoh> I don't know how to do it any faster via google
[15:01:01] <eyeoh> it's also faster than typing packages.debian.org etc

[15:06:03] <AquaL1te> any suggestions for this apt-listbugs versus ansible question? Hi, I would like to use `apt-listbugs`, but it seems not to play nice with Ansible. Is there a way to ignore/disable the `apt-listbugs` error code in Ansible? Like a special flag or something?
[15:06:07] <AquaL1te> Probably if I set this `DPkg::Pre-Install-Pkgs {"/usr/bin/apt-listbugs apt";};` to `DPkg::Pre-Install-Pkgs {"/usr/bin/apt-listbugs --force-yes apt";};` for package installs, but not for package updates, then I have the behavior I want (assume yes and just install even if bugs are found).
[15:06:12] <AquaL1te> Bootstrapping a system works then fine, but then monitor for bugs when updating a system. `dpkg_options` can probably not be used for that, since that requires arguments for e.g. `Dpkg::Options::=--force-confdef`, where as an argument you just leave `force-confdev`, so you're only adding/changing things in the `Dpkg::Options` context, while I need to work in `Dpkg::Pre-Install`.
[15:06:38] <AquaL1te> whoops.. i wanted to copy/paste just this link: https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/comments/rmttf6/aptlistbugs_apt_returned_an_error_code_during_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

[21:56:51] <eyeoh> yeah I built most of my speed on some dos program I can't recall
[21:57:00] <eyeoh> it just felt pure, raw, and fast
[21:57:36] <eyeoh> this is the keyboard that vi's arrows are from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-3A#Hardware
[21:57:51] <ede> i'm better than a lot of people i've seen still, even IT folks. but then i've read they produce like 5 lines of code per day, so speed typing isn't really their interest heh
[21:58:19] <eyeoh> heh, well there's a spectrum
[21:58:35] <ede> still far away from her https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populaire_(film)
[21:58:58] <ede> i've met someone on irc who interestingly even learned it on NORMAL SCHOOL!
[21:59:24] <eyeoh> I'm (just) old enough that I still got to learn to type in school
[21:59:31] <ede> and it wasn't the type of school usually leading to a job where you spend your time on a type writer
[21:59:54] <eyeoh> but yeah, 3 second mark - Linus Torvalds can't touch type: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5S9LIT-hdc&t=3s
[22:00:17] <ede> interesting. my school had a title longer that of an persian prince, but it was all about theory
[22:01:09] <ede> heh, everytime i try i type half a word at about 1 letter per 2 secs and then i start hunting for the next key. including trying to reach the BSP.
[22:01:28] <ede> really faster to move the whole hand.

[22:23:34] <knghtbrd> Telgareith: The safest way to do it is to get the source package and build-dependencies and build a deb for bullseye.
[22:23:50] <knghtbrd> Telgareith: Realistically though … if you can satisfy the package deps, the .deb should work in this case
[22:23:53] *** Parts: n3o (~utamaro@user/utamaro) (Leaving)
[22:25:14] <knghtbrd> My advice for Debian's package system is to regard it like a tree: You can fairly safely mess with a few of the leaves. If you start messing with the branches or worse the trunk, you're going to cause problems.
[22:25:46] <knghtbrd> the package in question sounds like a vvery small leaf 😁
