[08:02:31] <Jong> What are other ways to say "that didn't sit well with me" in the context of someone saying something offensive. For example, a doctor tells a girl aspiring to be a pro athlete but who's been injured "you should get married and raise kids. It's no big deal if you can't play sports anymore."
[08:05:10] <twb> Jong: "what a fucking asshole"
[08:12:40] <Jong> thanks twb 
[08:15:47] <kurahaupo> Jong: An insensitive clod
[08:15:48] <Jong> The doctor's statement reflects prejudicial beliefs that are distasteful and that hurt me
[08:15:49] <Jong> how's that?
[08:17:38] <kurahaupo> Jong: If my doctor exhibited that attitude, they wouldn't be my doctor for long. That's borderline professional incompetence
[08:17:52] <Jong> attitude! good word
[08:18:31] <Jong> The doctor's statement reflected a discriminatory attitude that's distasteful and contrary to basic decency 
[08:20:42] <kurahaupo> A general practitioner should have a reasonable grounding in mental health care. Those kinds of statements are likely to cause significant distress and exacerbate any underlying mental health issues; that's failing the Hippocratic oath: First Do No Harm.
[08:21:48] <kurahaupo> Sometimes doctors have to give bad news, but they should at least be apologetic about it
[08:22:56] <kurahaupo> The stuff about having kids is biased and stupid but not necessarily unprofessional.
[08:24:35] <kurahaupo> guest42: the event was brought forward; please bring the event forward.

[13:13:40] <hackinghorn> also, how to call your aunts/uncles?
[13:14:35] <hackinghorn> I mean, if I shouldnt call my parents by name, maybe I shouldnt to my aunts/uncles and then my father-in-law
[13:14:44] <pussipupu> As an adult I call them by their first names, as a child I called them "aunty firstname" or "uncle firstname"
[13:15:14] <hackinghorn> wait what? its possible?
[13:15:24] <hackinghorn> sounds kinda rude
[13:15:29] <pussipupu> What's possible?
[13:15:57] <hackinghorn> sounds rude to me

[18:57:04] <Varde> I also think American English and English English need to combine to use 1 English. Concerning Color and Colour, Color is right, and concerning Favour and Favor. Favour is right.
[19:00:51] <bp99> Yeah, I think we should also standardize percentages while we are at it. 5% is wrong and 0.05 is right ;-)

[19:07:15] <Varde> She threatens to call... Someone but it's clearly a vigilante system.
[19:08:08] <Varde> Doesn't fav-our, and Col - or ~ sound correct?

[19:11:49] * Varde listens to the col- ore and the fav - hour sounds.

[19:18:24] <Varde> How do they rhyme?
[19:18:42] <sam113101> the way I pronounce the or in favor is closer to "her" than it is to "or", but it's not a gigantic difference

[21:08:49] <terminalpusher> damn it seems it really is pronounced like "right"
[21:09:13] <LjL> that's ww-rong to pronounce it
[21:09:14] <MetaNova> for me, in my dialect, "rite" (as in, "rite of passage"), "right" (as in, "you're right"), and "write" sound identical
[21:09:28] <LjL> no really i haven't heard of a dialect where it's pronounced but with english i never rule things out
[21:09:55] <huf> it's pronounced in some dialects of continental english
[21:10:01] <huf> namely the dialects of people not very good at english
[21:10:26] <terminalpusher> oh no have i been listening to too much continental/bad english
