[01:21:30] <CarloWood> I was thinking: what would happen if you represent every rational number as a vector in an infinite dimensional space - where each axis represents the power of a prime.  Ie, let the coordinates in order correspond to 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 ... etc.

[01:43:31] <mycroftiv> twJizhan: I recommend classical 1st order logic + set theory and its model theory as one branch, and constructive type theory like Martin-LÃ¶f's or HoTT as the other
[01:43:54] <mycroftiv> category theory will get referenced a lot and you can hopefully pick up categories and topos theory also as you go
[01:45:23] <twJizhan> thanks mycroftiv let me think about it...
[01:45:43] <mycroftiv> there is a LOT of semi-duplication of concepts and places where the historical development and the clear concepts are not aligned, the coherent survey style overview of where things are right now doesnt exist other than maybe just reading wikipedia articles
[01:47:10] <mycroftiv> I recommend the youtube lectures of Joel David Hamkins a lot for classical set theory foundations
[01:48:15] <mycroftiv> I like Ken Kunen and Jech in set theory written texts
[01:49:21] <mycroftiv> the 'HoTT book' is kind of the standard book for type theory foundations but I think learning the older and simpler pure MLTT via coding in Agda is maybe more clarifying to approach that side
[01:50:14] <twJizhan> Do you (and most researchers) consider "foundations of math" includes "foundations of theoretical CS"?
[01:50:35] <mycroftiv> i cant speak for most researchers but i think so

[01:53:50] <mycroftiv> the way set theoretic logic can be expressed as boolean algebra of switching gates in information communication network is the foundation of modern computing
[01:55:01] <mycroftiv> well, modern computing isnt directly based on set theory - what I mean is that set theory and boolean algebra are deeply related, and expressing the sophisticated high level abstractions of computer programs goes through logic gates physically
[01:57:39] <twJizhan> Then, maybe I better begin by following Open Logic Projects' textbooks than Harrie de Swart, because they contains "computability" topics, to some (what?) extent?

[02:12:19] <Fangs> no, but please don't feel compelled to explain it to me
[02:12:30] <mycroftiv> its really neither more nor less than the core duality of description vs the actual construction
[02:12:33] <mycroftiv> the recipe vs the baked cake
[02:12:45] <mycroftiv> the type signature is a recipe, the term is a specific example of it
[02:13:01] <mycroftiv> the theories/axioms are a description, for which you then provide concrete data in the form of a model
[02:13:10] <Fangs> you know how there are dualities with 'geometries' and 'algebra'?
[02:13:18] <mycroftiv> yes
[02:13:41] <Fangs> 'actual construction' would be my geometric things, and description 'algebra'

[02:35:07] <mycroftiv> twjizhan: I think in a way the binary patterns of the Yi Jing are almost like an imagination of the rules and possibilities of digital computing, far before it could be done
[02:35:42] <mycroftiv> because we now understand it is true you can represent any information with a large enough quantity of binary bits, and in general you can compress a large amount of bits to a smaller and retain the most significant information
[02:36:17] <mycroftiv> so I feel the Yi Jing is expressing this idea that all the patterns of the universe can be built up from repeated powerset of 2

[02:51:43] <mycroftiv> ^^ there is a mathematician studying large cardinal set theory from a vedic spiritual perspective and doing excellent work, i think - the mathematics is real and solid, the philosophy is up to you to decide if you like
[02:52:43] <twJizhan> maybe this is an example of the way of ancient Indian logic: "negation" can be developed in to two ways: (1) "negation = admitting the opposite" (2) "negation != admitting the opposite"
[02:53:06] <mycroftiv> there is actually something like that in constructive logic vs classical
[02:53:55] <mycroftiv> in classical logic, proving not-not-X is the same as proving X. in constructive logic, there is a distinction
[02:54:39] <mycroftiv> constructively, you have not 'proved X' until you present a constructed, specific X - just proving that it is impossible for X not to exist is insufficient!
[02:55:11] <twJizhan> wow I see I recalled this fact
[02:56:07] <twJizhan> so return to Yi-Jing... is Yi-Jing "constructive math" kind or "classical math" kind?
[02:57:00] <mycroftiv> i would say because the hexagrams are finite and there are 64 of them, it is constructive. in the case of finite objects like 64 possibilities within 2^6, the constructive and classical view is the same usually

[02:57:19] <mycroftiv> however - if you imagine bigger Yi Jing with an INFINITE number of lines, then it would be different
[02:57:58] <mycroftiv> if instead of just 6 lines from 000000 to 111111 in binary, we imagine infinite Yi Jing with 0111000111...... on to infinity, an infinite binary sequence, then classical and constructive view diverge
[02:58:11] <mycroftiv> and a vital aspect of that divergence is the existence of free ultrafilters
[02:58:57] <mycroftiv> a free ultrafilter is like a 'fair map' from 0/1 all the way to the infinite 01010101... powerset of all possible infinite binary sequences
[02:59:56] <mycroftiv> in fact - and pardon me if this is absurd from a culturally grounded view - I have had the idea that the free ultrafilter represents the possibility of generating a symmetrical Yin Yang representing infinite balance and smoothness as the infinite limit of extending the binary hexagram pattern from finite to infinite

[03:01:09] <mycroftiv> so in this rather philosophical view, the classical viewpoint is postulating a kind of infinite balance and symmtery can be found in the limit, which we cannot describe with explicit computation, but still emerges in the pattern of the whole
[03:01:33] <mycroftiv> free ultrafilters on the powerset of the naturals exist in standard ZFC
[03:02:15] <mycroftiv> because of the 'C' - Boolean Prime Ideal is a weak choice principle so if you have the C, you get free ultrafilters on N, but there are models of ZF without them

[03:03:16] <mycroftiv> there are models of ZF in which those sets dont exist, because the axioms no longer require them
[03:03:34] <mycroftiv> twjizhan: just think of it as some 'exotic animal' which may or may not be in a given zoo
[03:03:55] <mycroftiv> ZFC guarantees that the 'zoo of sets' contains the 'free ultrafilter' set-animal
[03:04:25] <mycroftiv> whereas if you go to a ZF zoo, this animal may not be there, but most of the other animals are, because the axioms cause most of the same sets to exist

[03:07:10] <mycroftiv> there is no such set in zf or zfc because it would be paradoxical and inconsistent
[03:07:20] <mycroftiv> but there are different axiom systems in which you can have a set of all ordinals
[03:07:49] <mycroftiv> there are also cases where a set may or may not exist in different models of the same theory
[03:08:10] <mycroftiv> very notably, a set of reals with cardinality larger than that of the naturals but smaller than that of the set of all reals
[03:08:30] <mycroftiv> there are models of standard math that include such a set - and models of standard math that do not

[04:52:48] <Metaleer> \o/
[04:52:51] <Techcable> This is a proofs class
[04:53:03] <Batzy> Metaleer: libera shouldn't imply cs :) i joined as a 13 year old and ended up becoming a math student
[04:53:08] <Techcable> wow
[04:53:25] <Batzy> yeah you do set modulos equiv relation in an intro to proofs sort of class that a math student even might take
[04:53:46] <Techcable> At my school they let math majors pick an "emphasis" so you don't have to take theoretical classes unless you want to
[04:54:00] <Batzy> the cs students took discrete math in my undergraduate, but the math students had another course which was similar just more mathematically intense
[04:54:06] <Techcable> yes I've taken both
[04:54:22] <Batzy> Techcable: my opinion about cs is that people who don't value theory sort of rot away the field
[04:54:22] <Techcable> The CS proofs class was more nitpicky but the math class is harder
[04:54:27] <Batzy> im in cs now

[04:54:46] <Techcable> Yeah I mean there are a bunch of CS majors who just want to program
[04:54:51] <Metaleer> Batzy: It's not unusual here. Many (most?) are people with some sort of background in computers, so CS fits the bill. It's common for them to take discrete math, which I always found to be an interesting name. It's just graph theory, elementary number theory and some abstract algebra thrown in for good measure.
[04:54:52] <Batzy> im just really miffed with the volume of courses that don't rigorously define or prove *anything*

[04:56:11] <Batzy> well no i dont think the distinction between applied and pure math should be everyone's biggest consideration. but I do think people should know what they're talking about
[04:56:19] <z6np-6w> I picked up discrete math along the way somewhere. Interesting and fun! It just depends on algebra and logic mostly so it could be a freshman elective I can see it.
[04:56:20] <Batzy> instead of having a warm and fuzzy feeling about it
[04:56:23] <Metaleer> Typically they end up looking more like 'software engineering' majors than actual CS majors.

[04:58:03] <Batzy> by what metric

[04:58:20] <Techcable> top 50 in the US for software engineering, as rated by US News and world report
[04:58:32] <Batzy> let me see what US News ranks me
[04:58:50] <Techcable> Honestly I think the math in physics is more beautiful than the math in CS :p
[04:58:57] <Metaleer> Amen.
[04:59:02] * Metaleer physicist here.
[04:59:06] <Metaleer> Preach.
[04:59:12] <Techcable> I'm much more interested in diffeqs and stats than I am in abstract algebra
[04:59:16] <Techcable> and number theory
[04:59:23] <Techcable> Honestely I would like to avoid those calsses
[04:59:28] <Techcable> *classes
[04:59:37] <Metaleer> Well, hold on. Physics also has abstract algebra -- we use groups to describe symmetries.
[04:59:40] <Batzy> 12 in "software engineering"
[04:59:52] <Batzy> but these looks like rankings of the undergraduate program
[05:00:12] <Batzy> cs, math, and physics are all very related
[05:00:27] <Batzy> cs is like abusing physics to solve things in math maybe
[05:00:31] <Batzy> you can probably view it that way
[05:00:51] <Batzy> so classical computers are abusing the physics of electrodynamics or something
[05:00:54] <z6np-6w> diffeqs and stats just leads back into finite element analysis and stream processing
[05:00:59] <Techcable> oh I get what you're saying
[05:01:13] <Metaleer> Depends on how you view it. Physics and math were done by the same people some ~ 150 years ago; then, a separation happened.
[05:01:14] <Techcable> like ensalving the electricty
[05:01:20] <Batzy> there are people who have different computational models. A more jokey example was a paper I read about how they were doing computation with herds of crabs
[05:01:30] <Batzy> something weird like that
[05:01:32] <Techcable> Yes! I believe Maxwell was the first person to really use vector calc

[05:02:22] <Techcable> forcing me to do what?
[05:02:29] <Batzy> for example, a hot topic now is quantum computing. Which is just trying to abuse some other physical phenomenon to potentially get more computational power
[05:02:34] <Techcable> ah yeah
[05:02:38] <Batzy> right
[05:02:42] <Techcable> I don't really like quantnum physics very much
[05:02:48] <Batzy> so it's a lot about how physics is limiting your ability to do math
[05:02:51] <Techcable> Or it doesn't sound interesting to me
[05:02:54] <Metaleer> Why. :-D
[05:03:06] <Techcable> It's not classical I guess
[05:03:14] <Batzy> it is :)
[05:03:17] <Techcable> What sounds really cool is statistical mechanics
[05:03:22] <Batzy> classical can embed in qm
[05:03:25] <Techcable> I mean I'm only a freshman, but that sounds awesome
[05:03:37] <Metaleer> Well, yeah. Though if you like functional analysis, you could get into nonrelativistic QM.
[05:03:52] <Metaleer> That's the mathematical framework of it.
[05:04:00] <Techcable> Yeah I mean the math sounds cool, but conceptually I don't jive with it
[05:04:02] <Batzy> im not so sure how much quantum computing theorists care about relativistic vs nonrelativistic qm
[05:04:06] <Metaleer> Oh yeah.
[05:04:10] <Batzy> maybe that's dumb of me to say
[05:04:13] <Techcable> Also I want to learn the math for general relativity
[05:04:14] <Metaleer> It's a really ... bizarre theory.

[15:27:26] <bildramer> if you have a point source of particles undergoing brownian motion (i.e. a random walk), and you want to model adsorption, so whenever they touch a wall they disappear, and you want the steady-state solution to that, is there a differential equation that happens to describe that, too?

[20:56:44] <biberao> int-e: im asking because i found this
[20:56:59] <biberao> maybe in Portugal a trillion is different
[20:57:01] <biberao> lol

[21:01:34] <biberao> but the problem is
[21:01:40] <biberao> it was broadcasted country wide

[21:02:28] <biberao> and a math teacher was reading the numbers
[21:02:47] <biberao> like in Portugal in the 90s atleast we didnt say billions or trillions

[23:16:00] <Metaleer> WA is right; I also double checked with a Casio calculator that can do integrals.
[23:16:33] <Metaleer> That integral, if what you're supposed to evaluate is what you gave WA, yields 2 as the result.
[23:16:43] <blei> you have to pay to see how it does it
[23:17:34] <teacake> ah ive paid for the mobile version it doesnt show the calcu,ation for integrals there. maybe ill see what idiot mistake i made this time i write it..
[23:19:42] <[itchyjunk]> Quick check, is the varience of {1,..,10} 7.125?
[23:19:43] <Metaleer> teacake: https://i.imgur.com/RiQFWop.jpg
[23:20:14] <Metaleer> teacake: Make sure you're getting that as the last integral; the first integral, the one in 'y', is easy to evaluate and should return that.
[23:20:56] <joel135> teacake: you can check your results (intermediate or not) numerically like this https://pastebin.com/raw/91hJvZzr
[23:21:30] <Metaleer> LOL, Python's libraries give more error than a Casio calculator?
[23:21:39] <Metaleer> My calculator returns the exact value.
[23:22:04] <joel135> well i guess this proves calculators are superior to python's libraries
[23:22:41] <joel135> can it give you the exact value of log2(pi + e^2) as well?
