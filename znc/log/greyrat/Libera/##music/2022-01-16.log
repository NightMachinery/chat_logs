[19:31:57] <murthy> SteppenwolfVM: not gonna happen :D

[19:32:26] <murthy> louipc: what about you
[19:32:30] <SteppenwolfVM> murthy: bansuri sounds nice and is cheaper, concert flute is more elaborate and more expensive 
[19:32:35] <louipc> bonne appetite
[19:32:45] <louipc> not much
[19:32:49] <murthy> Chickie: ok I will convey it to artao

[19:33:00] <Janet> ^ The Best of Mussorgsky - YouTube
[19:33:18] <SteppenwolfVM> the downside of bansuri is the loud sound to the right of your ear, while the western concert flute has more tone where the mouth is
[19:33:21] <SteppenwolfVM> at least to my perception 
[19:33:30] <murthy> louipc: ty
[19:33:33] <murthy> SteppenwolfVM: oh
[19:33:47] <louipc> can ghosts reproduce
[19:33:58] <murthy> SteppenwolfVM: can you recommend a good brand?
[19:34:06] <murthy> for the Indian Bansuri that is
[19:34:14] <SteppenwolfVM> i'm not on track with either
[19:34:33] <louipc> i like the sound of wooden flutes
[19:34:35] <SteppenwolfVM> here in germany Bansuri flutes are usually imported from india for very cheap prices
[19:34:38] <murthy> louipc: can't people have peace even after death?
[19:34:47] <louipc> murthy: nope
[19:34:49] <SteppenwolfVM> in india you should be able to find better ones than we get here

[23:05:31] <morlog> my recumbent can keep up with the scooter
[23:05:43] <MusicalDillo> then it's happy accident that the other one failed and can be returned
[23:05:44] <morlog> 30mph on a flat is no problem
[23:06:04] <morlog> yeah
[23:06:06] <artao> wow
[23:06:10] <artao> how fast with inflated tires?
[23:06:12] <MusicalDillo> good to have a better helmet for those sorts of speeds
[23:06:16] <morlog> i wasnt too deep into payments on the scooter
[23:06:42] <morlog> they offered to give me all my money back but i told them id only accept half because ive been using it
[23:06:43] <MusicalDillo> Hopefully your friend will refund most of it?
[23:06:50] <MusicalDillo> ah OK
[23:07:02] <morlog> they are good people
