[00:43:45] <Jacobis9000> hi!
[00:44:00] <selwyn> hi
[00:44:34] <Jacobis9000> I am banned from #2600, someone spammed the channel using instances of my name, and they thought it was me
[00:44:41] <hayley> Hm, no, what happens if I have ab + a^b?
[00:45:18] <Jacobis9000> 2*2 + 2^2 = 8
[00:45:34] <Jacobis9000> oh no wait
[00:45:55] <selwyn> regex question i think
[00:46:02] <hayley> I can't do the derivative and then just not increment POSITION, either, as we could be ambiguous w.r.t incrementing or not. Bloody hell
[00:46:03] <Jacobis9000> 2*3 + 2^3 = 14
[00:46:21] <hayley> hayley's conjecture: If it's a pain in the ass to do with derivatives, it might not be regular
[00:46:39] <Jacobis9000> sounds reasonable
[00:46:47] <Jacobis9000> I wrote a defence of universal, absolute truth once
[00:47:35] <aeth> The problem is in the jump from the deductive to the inductive.
[00:47:35] <Jacobis9000> as the third chapter in an intellectual history, explication, and critique of, a postmodernist American philosopher
[00:47:41] <hayley> "Zero-width assertions are painful for automata-based approaches, especially forwards asserts." - a Hyperscan author
[00:48:01] <hayley> "As a rule, forward asserts are ugly and are "as easy to do as determinizing the two patterns together from that point on" - which can be trivial, or it can be a horrible world-smashing explosion."
[00:48:14] <aeth> You can have universal, absolute truth in the very narrow sense of given a certain axiom system and a certain logic system, you can establish some theorems (but you can't prove everything that you want to, via Godel's incompleteness)
[00:48:30] <aeth> But as soon as you go to the real world, the best you have is statistics
[00:49:01] <Jacobis9000> T is True if and only if T is both a definition of truth and a universal, absolute truth.
[00:49:41] <aeth> The problem with formal logic is that it works out very well in the mathematical domain, and it even follows through to the theoretical side of computer science.
[00:49:52] <aeth> But in the real world, the probability of *nothing* is 1
[00:49:58] <aeth> not one thing, I mean
[00:50:13] <aeth> You can get a certain amount of 9s in 0.999...
[00:50:28] <Jacobis9000> Well the probability of nothing is 1, because without nothing, there wouldn't be everything, for which the probability is also 1.
[00:50:38] <aeth> Even implementing theoretical computer science ideals into a computer program runs into real world limitations as well as real world issues such as hardware failure.
[00:50:45] <selwyn> events w/ probability 1 don't have to happen anyway
[00:51:01] <aeth> selwyn: yeah, but that's just p->q in logic, where p has to happen for q to happen
[00:51:01] <Jacobis9000> oh good point
[00:51:12] <selwyn> not a logic theory thing
[00:51:21] <selwyn> measure theory
[00:51:58] <Jacobis9000> but I didn't rest my argument on the fact that formal logic applies in physical reality, that would be silly
[00:52:42] <aeth> Right. All you have is math and the mathy side of the closely related fields like statistics (in this case, the mathy side is mostly probability) and computer science (theoretical comp sci as well as how programming languages are supposed to work on paper)
[00:52:59] <selwyn> the probability of getting exactly 0.5 from sampling the interval [0,1] uniformly is zero, yet that event can still occur
[00:53:14] <aeth> I suppose you get theoretical physics, too, but a beautiful theory that doesn't accruately describe reality is pointless
[00:53:25] <Jacobis9000> I stated my formal logic, and then, I proceeded to argue that the existence of universal and absolute truth is true because truth and falsehood are absolutes and that if it were true that there is no such thing as universal truth, this itself would be a universal truth, and all sorts of other points, because I was critiquing this particular chap
[00:54:03] <selwyn> aeth: i would say that the theoretical physics theories we do have, are actually really hard to ground in rigorous mathematical truth
[00:54:05] <Jacobis9000> his central thesis was that metaphor is an extra-linguistic action in the course of discourse which fundamentally alters reality
[00:54:10] <aeth> selwyn: Physics is just an attempt to find the simplest mathematical model that fits observations, which will be adjusted to more complicated forms as observations change (e.g. modern physics over classical physics)... so as mathy as it seems, even that isn't deductive.
[00:54:29] <aeth> And you can see that in the simplicity of the mathematical constants vs the mess of the physical ones
[00:54:53] <selwyn> hm
[00:55:13] <selwyn> i certainly agree that physics is not some exercise in deductive logic
[00:55:35] <aeth> or Truth
[00:55:56] <aeth> since there are an infinite number of models that will fit reality and the physicist aesthetically chooses the simplest one until a more complicated one is found to be necessary
[00:56:05] <aeth> Ideally, with predictive power
[00:56:46] <aeth> (the number of models are infinite in the same sense that the number of things you can make in most formal languages are infinite... like programming languages...)
[00:56:55] <Jacobis9000> I think you can derive universal truths from pure observation. It does not have to mean that scientific constants (which are in reality inconstant) need to be in reality constant, for a truth about the universe derived using those mathematical constants to be true. You could say it's true only for a given point (contingent, as Rorty argues), but that depends on the truth in question.
[00:56:59] <aeth> (you can just arbitrarily add complications)
[00:57:21] <Jacobis9000> and it doesn't even have to be scientific observation
[00:58:08] <aeth> Jacobis9000: a good scientific model is *predictive* and is far more useful in that sense than trying to fit a model to each new observation... it really allows modern engineering
[00:58:18] <aeth> However, at any given time, a new observation can break a model
[00:58:35] <aeth> It's unlikely to happen for something we've observed a lot, but it's fairly likely to happen at the edge of what our technology allows us to observe
[00:58:59] <Jacobis9000> Yes that's all fine, how does that negate universal, absolute truth? 
[00:59:11] <aeth> Crucially, the new model needs to still explain things that the old model explained. Modern physics can, afaik, simplify down to classical physics for things of 'normal' scale, where the early modern observations were
[00:59:32] <Jacobis9000> Yes it can
[00:59:40] <aeth> But the new model could have been selected in the first place, but wouldn't have been chosen because the physicist aesthetically chooses the simplest fit
[00:59:43] <Jacobis9000> It is a question of perspective
[01:00:09] <selwyn> i don't know that the criteria for selection are aesthetic
[01:00:36] <selwyn> in history, we can see that there is a convoluted and highly complex consensus mechanism at play when new physics theories are proposed and ultimately accepted
[01:00:38] <aeth> Jacobis9000: Anyway, my point is, even if the physical reality has some absolutes, we can't really know them because all we're doing is fitting one of an infinite number of models on current observations
[01:00:58] <aeth> Contrast this with mathematics, where for the given axiom system and logic system, we *know*
[01:01:21] <aeth> If you dissent in mathematics, you're proposing an entirely new axiom set, you're not disputing a theorem because you can't
[01:02:28] <aeth> selwyn: The simplest model that fits the observations is chosen. This is arbitrary, and there may even be multiple 'simple' models where one is selected for historical reasons. e.g. the sign of the charge of an electron.
[01:03:15] <aeth> This means that if there is an underlying physical certainty, we're only approximating it.
[01:03:24] <Jacobis9000> aeth that is fine, but that does not negate universal and absolute truth, such a statement, if true, is in fact, an absolute truth about the universe, in that it is either absolutely true or not true at all, and it concerns the whole of the physical universe, and is thus universal. I.e., the statement, "It is difficult to find absolutes or universals by the lights of science in the physical 
[01:03:30] <Jacobis9000> universe." Is an absolute, universal truth, if true.
[01:03:35] <Jacobis9000> Anyway they'll turn up, science is very young
[01:04:12] <aeth> Consider the problem of trying to produce identical output to a computer program that you cannot directly inspect in any way (source code, disassembling, reading the machine code, etc.) and can only run with repeated inputs.
[01:04:26] * hayley wants to test PCRE, but doesn't know if the JIT can do submatching.
[01:04:33] <selwyn> isn't that impossible to do?
[01:05:19] <aeth> Jacobis9000: There are multiple algorithms that produce the same results (consider sorting algorithms) and even with the same characteristics (again, consider sorting algorithms)
[01:05:33] <aeth> So my kind of reverse engineering as described won't get you truth, only predictive power
[01:05:48] <Jacobis9000> The well-known limits of the scientific method of philosophical inquiry do not negate universal, absolute truth either.
[01:06:02] <aeth> Right, it just makes it unknowable
[01:06:04] <aeth> if it's there
[01:08:04] <aeth> if your job is to clone sort() and you wind up with something that behaves the same for observable inputs that you've tried (which might not even be a proper sort if there's a bug in the original), that doesn't mean that your implementation is the same because there are many different ways. Even if you observed the timing!
[01:08:30] <aeth> And physics is a much more complicated system than digital sorting
[01:08:53] <Jacobis9000> If your criteria for what constitutes knowledge is limited to scientific evidence, theories and models, and this is anyway only contingent on the present level of scientific development, which as I said is very early.

[01:10:13] <aeth> Science is the *steelman* of real world knowledge outside of the deductive, though
[01:10:29] <aeth> Something like physics has a much higher degree of certainty than most things
[01:11:06] <Jacobis9000> But it doesn't have the monopoly on knowledge. It's objects are limited to physical objects which can be observed by its lights.
[01:11:13] <Jacobis9000> Its*
[01:13:06] <aeth> Physics doesn't have a monopoly on knowledge, but there are few environments that are so clean. Perhaps computer programming, assuming that you program within the limitations of the machine and your machine does not have a hardware failure of some sort. The program should follow the theoretical expectations. Of course, these days, software systems are so complicated...
[01:13:59] <aeth> But the strongest places for knowledge are theorems, which is probably why the Greeks were obsessed with geometry, which was the most developed mathematics of the time.
[01:14:17] <Jacobis9000> It's also fundamentally human, contextualised within human society and human groups, political, and vulnerable to individual bias. Even the choice of area to research is the very entry of bias at the very beginning of the process of scientific research.
[01:15:14] <Jacobis9000> Geometry is very useful, and the Greeks attached much mystical and spiritual meaning to mathematics as well.
[01:16:09] <Jacobis9000> Such that St Augustine castigated mathematicians as leading man into sin, because by that point in history, the works of mathematicians were associated with the occult.
[01:16:16] <Jacobis9000> I think it was Augustine
[01:17:04] <selwyn> had no idea maths was ever persecuted
[01:17:20] <aeth> Philosophy can interfere with mathematics
[01:17:23] <aeth> 0 was controversial
[01:17:47] <selwyn> a fun fact is that china is really good at non-standard analysis
[01:17:52] <Jacobis9000> I have had long arguments with my friend that 0, which is a symbol for nothing, is not a number, but the absence of a number
[01:17:57] <aeth> You don't really get an easy 0 until you use a positional numeral system like the one we have
[01:18:03] <Jacobis9000> but I concede for the sake of common parlance 0 is a number
[01:18:15] <selwyn> because it was favoured by mao for some obscure reason (highly compatible with scientific materialism iirc)
[01:19:13] <aeth> Jacobis9000: what 0 means depends on the context
[01:19:35] <semz> iirc standard vs non-standard analysis is mostly an issue of presentation rather than an issue of results anyway
[01:19:38] <aeth> for instance, if we had a 0 before we came up with the year system (we didn't), we'd have a year 0, but 0 would just be an arbitrary point in a system that would go both positive and negative
[01:19:48] <Jacobis9000> The problem with materialism is that it is reductionist, and ignores the vast amount of the human consciousness and society which is immaterial, such as ideas, language, emotions etc., and can only study these things in a limited way which fails to capture anywhere near their whole truth

[01:20:44] <selwyn> iirc new calendar systems invented after the discovery of 0 don't have a zero year
[01:20:50] <aeth> some do
[01:20:52] <aeth> some don't
[01:20:54] <selwyn> oh
[01:20:57] <aeth> 0 took a while to be accepted
[01:21:35] <aeth> I think a lot of computer-based dates are actually a modification of our standard calendar, with 0 equal to 1 BCE, and with prior years as negatives, so every negative date is shifted by 1
[01:21:35] <selwyn> i don't actually like the idea of zero indexing a calendar anyway
[01:21:44] <aeth> including 0 in a calendar allows for calculations
[01:21:45] <Jacobis9000> aeth but the ultimate meaning of 0 is nothing. And you could say the point of Christ's birth was 0 months, and there were twelve months following which were the 1st whole year.
[01:22:16] <Jacobis9000> uh 11 months
[01:22:32] <aeth> Jacobis9000: 0 can mean absent in that position, or it can mean the origin. In a 'timeline', it would mean origin.
[01:22:43] <aeth> Of course, the origin just means the absence of an offset.
[01:23:05] <Jacobis9000> but the origin is absence, it is the point at which before there was no thing A, after which there was thing A
[01:23:09] <Jacobis9000> the origin = 0 = nothing
[01:23:14] <aeth> But the origin is arbitrary and you can have an infinite number of them. (Even for years, since you don't need to start Jan 1)
[01:24:09] <aeth> Jacobis9000: The origin just means, no vector (for years, a 1D vector which is the same as a scalar) offset in a particular coordinate system
[01:24:20] <Jacobis9000> well 0 is infinite, and all number systems are arbitrary in some sense since they are decided by convention and agreement
[01:24:36] <aeth> The location of the 0 is arbitrary
[01:24:58] <aeth> The Christian calendar system, if it had a year 0, wouldn't even place it correctly because there are two candidate dates, one earlier and one later.
[01:25:23] <selwyn> calendars are for humans, not computers, and humans count starting with 1
[01:25:34] <Jacobis9000> yeah
[01:25:44] <selwyn> so i don't like this idea that we should use the system that is easier for calculating
[01:25:47] <selwyn> but i accept the logic
[01:25:56] <aeth> Even Christmas has the wrong date because shepherds apparently aren't out in the winter.
[01:26:39] <Jacobis9000> Christmas was chosen to coincide with the Winter Solstice, it is not actually the historical birth of Jesus
[01:27:11] <Jacobis9000> But that's not 'wrong', it is a festival of remembrance of Jesus' birth, it can happen any time.
[01:27:33] <Jacobis9000> Noone actually knows when he was born.
[01:28:12] <Jacobis9000> The Queen has two birthdays, didja know?
[01:30:14] <selwyn> wonder if she will get better
[01:30:33] <Jacobis9000> Well anyway I think 0 represents nothing, in decimal anyway and binary anyway. There are infinite points between 0 and 1, so both 0 and 1 are infinite.
[01:30:38] <Jacobis9000> Is she poorly?
[01:31:03] <selwyn> uh yeah fairly ill

[01:38:48] <Jacobis9000> That's an ample majority.
[01:38:57] <aeth> so the majority wants to stay with the UK (for now) but a substantial minority views the UK as an occupying force
[01:39:23] <selwyn> reason why the north is that way is because it was gerrymandered to be that way by britain in the first place
[01:39:35] <aeth> Demographically, this is only expected to last for a few more decades.

[01:44:55] <pl> Jacobis9000: even if I were for Brexit, I'd call what was delivered a brexshit. I mean, they went into battles of wit... unarmed, and it showed
[01:45:06] <selwyn> but it is not certain, sinn fein have basically one shot at it that they can't fuck up
[01:45:10] <selwyn> but it could totally happen
[01:45:16] <aeth> Brexit moved up Irish reunification a decade or two, but it will still take time for demographics to shift. Maybe Covid moved it up even more.
[01:45:32] <Jacobis9000> Well that was Theresa May's fault. She was never meant to be Prime Minister, she was absolutely useless, and a remainer anyway.
[01:45:44] <Jacobis9000> It was a cockup because Gove stabbed Boris in the back
[01:45:52] <selwyn> they need to be in power in the republic, and at least in part in the north, and call a reunification referendum at the right time
[01:46:03] <Jacobis9000> And that happened because Gove's harridan Daily Mail columnist wife wanted to be married to the PM
[01:46:30] <pl> Jacobis9000: More like none of them were ever competent, and May's incompetence took peak in not recognizing the poisoned chalice that was being PM
[01:46:50] <Jacobis9000> I know she's thick as poo, worst Home Secretary in history

I'm not suggesting either of them were particularly ideologically or spiritually or emotionally committed to their sides, but Boris was beholden to his and necessary to unite the Tory Party.

[01:55:19] <Jacobis9000> Remember the adaptation with Sting in it? I loved that film, they totally camped up Dune
[01:55:24] <Jacobis9000> this is not camped up at all
[01:55:42] <Jacobis9000> Could have been camped up a bit more, tbh, I'd love to have seen the Emperor and the Imperial Court in all their fancy gowns
[01:55:45] <Jacobis9000> but no such scenes
[01:55:47] <selwyn> have not watched the whole lynch film but am familiar with it
[01:56:16] <Jacobis9000> but really good film
[01:56:26] <Jacobis9000> a serious adaptation of Dune
[01:56:46] <selwyn> feel that it would be better as a mini series
[01:57:02] <selwyn> hard to get all the context in otherwise
[01:57:14] <selwyn> too much material
[01:57:32] <aeth> but these days, a miniseries would be on $streaming_service_you_dont_have
[01:57:36] <Jacobis9000> but also focused a lot on the action, for example no explanation of Mentats, no Luddite Revolt against the Machine Intelligences mentioned, as a cinemagoer you're just expected to accept the universe as it is
[01:58:05] <selwyn> well, in a miniseries you can do that, and people will pay attention
[01:58:15] <Jacobis9000> yeah
[01:58:44] <Jacobis9000> glad it was a film though, it felt awesome on the big screen
[01:58:52] <Jacobis9000> it really is very good
[01:59:06] <Jacobis9000> but helps if you've read the book, I know people who hadn't were confused
[01:59:31] <selwyn> going to finally watch this squid game thing now
[01:59:39] <Jacobis9000> not touching it myself
[01:59:45] <Jacobis9000> I don't like things like that
[01:59:55] <Jacobis9000> Guard the Sense Doors, sayeth the Buddha Gautama
[02:00:34] <Jacobis9000> ok bbiab I am off to play Cyberpunk 2077

[15:16:23] <selwyn> was altavista actually good?
[15:18:55] <gilberth> selwyn: Oh, that is so incredible long ago. But perhaps yes. The search engines were all crap before Google. With Google you could actually find something. Not like today where Google becomes useless somehow.
[15:19:08] <selwyn> yes
[15:19:42] <selwyn> perhaps drew can make the open source search engine
[15:20:33] <gilberth> selwyn: It still surprises me how simple the initial Google algorithm was and how effective and why nobody else came up with that.
[15:20:53] <selwyn> iirc people came very close but was not commercialised because reasons
[15:21:30] <gilberth> And what also paid off well, I guess, is that Google was ad-free. At that time you could hardly make out the search results between all the blinking ads.

[15:25:22] <gilberth> Ah, I remember. That buggy hello world program.
[15:25:26] <hayley> The joke is that once I found a zero-day in Drew's over-engineered Gemini server which was laughably dumb. I just sent it a null byte, and it would lose track of some string length or something, then crash and burn.

[15:26:01] <hayley> Of no practical use, since people have a script or init daemon to restart the server.

[15:28:28] <selwyn> starting to get into org mode
[15:29:36] <hayley> @gilberth Actually, I wrote a program to fuzz test, and it found NUL on its own. Took me a while to figure out what it did.
[15:33:49] <hayley> It was weird because you require a second request to kill it, and that second request can be anything. So I got confused trying to reduce request strings.
[15:53:47] <selwyn>  did you tell drew

[17:15:23] <selwyn> it died for our sins
[17:16:13] <selwyn> and i have an extra ssd now
[17:17:31] <shka> i guess it's something
[17:17:52] <selwyn> i mean, the macbook was dead anyway
[17:18:08] <selwyn> i only did some graverobbing
[17:18:21] <shka> parts harvesting
[17:20:40] <selwyn> hm, can i get anything else out of it
[17:21:20] <selwyn> ram?
[17:21:21] <shka> dunno man
[17:21:35] <shka> isn't it soldered on to a motherboard?
[17:21:52] <shka> it seems to always be the case on those macs
[17:21:52] <selwyn> most stuff looks soldered
[17:24:21] <shka> apple products are like that
[17:24:27] <selwyn> lucky to get the ssd
[17:24:41] <selwyn> why wasn't that soldered?
[17:27:04] <shka> well, retrieving data from dead macbooks is a task common enough to warrant having the ability to pull the ssd out 
[17:27:23] <selwyn> i don't get it
[17:27:31] <shka> also, SSDs can fail
[17:27:32] <selwyn> apple like to make that task easier?
[17:27:43] <shka> well, for the authorized service?
[17:27:47] <shka> why not :D
[17:27:49] <selwyn> right
[17:27:51] <selwyn> ok
[17:27:56] <shka> also, don't give them ideas
[17:28:03] <shka> maybe they simply forgot about this one
[17:28:33] <selwyn> lol
[17:28:41] <gilberth> Yep, I once got a fried motherboard replaced with my laptop and was surprised that the data was still all there as I got the machine back.

[18:34:10] <Jacobis9000> Hello! So I have decided Swift is a really bad language, and I will not do my final project for CS50 in Swift as an iOS app, and will instead continue to learn Lisp even if it takes me into the new year and do my final project in Lisp
[18:34:30] <Jacobis9000> well not necessarily really bad, but I do not enjoy the syntax
[18:34:38] <Jacobis9000> whereas Lisp is sublime
[18:35:10] <selwyn> unfortunately, you cannot make ios apps in lisp afaik, but you could make an android app
[18:35:19] <selwyn> not really a beginners project but could work if you are ambitious

[18:40:05] <Jacobis9000> Yes I am going to stick with Lisp, although unfortunately I cannot make an iOS app and run it on my phone.
[18:40:58] <Jacobis9000> this is the syntax for creating a set in Swift:  var setName = Set<Type>()
[18:45:43] <Jacobis9000> oh yeah quick question, how do I load a file into Slime for using the functions I've already written?
[18:54:05] <Jacobis9000> never mind found out
[19:01:07] <shka> anybody using clpm already?
[19:02:21] <Jacobis9000> exercise 4.18 in CL intro is too hard for me
[19:02:46] <shka> Jacobis9000: load-file to load file
[19:03:01] <edgar-rft> is clpm like clam but for the afternoon?

[19:30:25] <Jacobis9000> man I am struggling with emacs
[19:30:50] <Jacobis9000> my windows move all about the place, I can't figure out how to close one or shift them around as I want to
[19:31:51] <Jacobis9000> ah maybe C-x 0
[19:32:07] <White_Flame> C-x 1 makes the current buffer fill the entire window
[19:32:26] <White_Flame> q also closes a lot of temporary buffers/panels
[19:32:46] <White_Flame> like warnings, macro expansions, sldb, etc
[19:36:29] <Jacobis9000> I need C-x 0
[19:36:32] <Jacobis9000> wow this book is tough
[19:36:44] <Jacobis9000> I have to code (AND X Y Z W) using cond
[19:37:53] <White_Flame> heh, the answer is pretty short
[19:38:08] <White_Flame> consider the boolean expression for each clause to execute
[19:38:27] <White_Flame> while doing the short circuiting, of course
[19:45:52] <Jacobis9000> AND stops at NIL, COND stops at T
[19:45:58] <Jacobis9000> I can't figure this out
[19:46:53] <Jacobis9000> I need all the CONDs to evaluate to false to return the last item like AND, but if it does that, it wouldn't behave like AND, so I am stuck
[19:47:24] <White_Flame> why wouldn't it be like AND?
[19:47:54] <White_Flame> also, are X/Y/Z/W expressions that might have side effects, or just variables
[19:48:07] <Jacobis9000> I don't know
[19:48:25] <White_Flame> what's the exercise?
[19:49:51] <Jacobis9000> Write the expression (AND Z Y Z W) wusing COND instead of AND, and then using nested IFs
[19:50:09] <Jacobis9000> (AND X Y Z W)
[19:50:40] <Jacobis9000> not a clue how to do it 
[19:51:07] <White_Flame> but you can do the nested IF version?
[19:51:26] <Catie> Jacobis9000: would you not just negate each expression? Like (COND ((NOT X)) ((NOT Y)) ...)
[19:51:30] <Jacobis9000> no I am trying to do the cond version
[19:51:33] <Jacobis9000> I thought that Catie
[19:51:39] <Catie> Didn't work?
[19:51:39] <gilberth> Nested IFs would IMHO be easier. Anyhow, When X is false what should (AND X Y Z W) be? What if X is true?
[19:51:42] <Jacobis9000> I will try that and see if it works
[19:51:51] <gilberth> Catie: That won't work.
[19:51:58] <Catie> Shucks, never mind
[19:52:30] <White_Flame> gilberth: it woudl work if there are no side effects
[19:52:32] <gilberth> The trick is to decompose that (AND X ....) is (IF X ...) ?
[19:53:05] <Jacobis9000> the nots don't work
[19:53:16] <White_Flame> also, you could write a recursive (defun my-and (&rest rest) ...) which only tests the first value and recurses
[19:53:17] <gilberth> White_Flame: I assume that effects and values of the original AND should be preserved.
[19:54:23] <Jacobis9000> nope I am stumped
[19:54:37] <Jacobis9000> I'll look up the solution
[19:54:40] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: You have a form (AND X ...whateverhere...) it is the same as (IF X whathere? whatthere?)
[19:55:21] <Jacobis9000> I need to use COND

[19:55:40] <Jacobis9000> I don't even understand the question
[19:55:41] <White_Flame> COND and IF are interchangeable
[19:55:49] <Jacobis9000> what (AND X Y Z W) is meaningless
[19:55:50] <gilberth> Sigh. (IF X Y Z) == (COND (X Y) (T Z))
[19:56:41] <gilberth> Again. When X is false. What is (AND X Y Z W) then?
[19:57:20] <Jacobis9000> oh the solution in the book is the solution I thought of, using (not x)
[19:57:37] <gilberth> Which surprises me.
[19:57:46] <White_Flame> right, and that assumes no side effects
[19:58:10] <Jacobis9000> I just coded the solution wrong
[19:58:10] <White_Flame> again, this probably asssumes x/y/z/w literally as already evaluated variable values

[20:04:23] <White_Flame> do you have an X defined anywhere?
