[00:11:24] <imode> dimadima: re "how did you produce that code", it's all done via a series of macros, labeled with an underscore.
[00:11:36] <imode> they build a command string which is fed into the interpreter.
[00:12:04] <imode> _seq is the most primitive: it takes in a variable number of arguments and gives you back those arguments concatenated.
[00:12:19] <Brekkjern> Oh, good lord... Apple is likely going to release new HW soon. Prepare for 100s of shitty posts about how amazing a new Mac would be and such shit
[00:12:42] <Brekkjern> Circlejerking about M1 and all that kind of jazz
[00:12:44] <ngoldbaum> also posts complaining about the posts
[00:13:02] <ngoldbaum> also disappointment that the m1x does or doesn’t slice bread
[00:13:04] <imode> you then have _0 and _1, which enqueue bits to the queue. _0l and _1l are just _seq(_0, _left) and _seq(_1, _left), which brings that bit to the head of the queue. then you have _loop, which just wraps whatever it's passed in [ and ].
[00:14:33] <imode> basically, _seq is sequence, _loop is selection + repetition combined, _0 and _1 and _0l and _1l are data and some organization.
[00:14:47] <imode> from these things you can build ten thousand things.

[00:17:01] <buttsbot> Presenting The Gold iPhone 5s | CONAN on TBS - YouTube - https://youtu.be/n7-RetY7fGo
[00:18:38] <imode> dimadima: for example, say you want to write a really primitive 'if', where you want the loop body to execute _just once_. the general form is "{condition} [ {body} 0<]", or "execute a condition which leaves a bit in the deque, if the bit is 1, execute the body, then enqueue a 0 and bring it to the head of the queue, stopping the loop."
[00:21:21] <imode> what happens when you leave the condition and body empty? well, if a 0 is at the head, it's dequeued and the loop is skipped. if a 1 is at the head, then it's dequeued, but the loop immediately ends due to us bringing a 0 to the head. this is why you can use [0<] to drop a bit, regardless of what it is.
[00:21:37] <imode> you can use _that_ to build an if/else form.
[00:22:05] <imode> that's how you recover selection statements.
[00:24:30] <imode> Brekkjern: I had a senior engineer flip out in happiness that IntelliJ interacts with the touchbar yesterday. his excitement was palpable.
[00:24:52] <Brekkjern> imode: :S
[00:25:25] <Brekkjern> I mean... It's cool and all, but it's kinda pointless?
[00:25:36] <imode> it's neat as a gimmick, I find it cool.
[00:26:36] <dimadima> thank you imode i saved those messages for when i play w/ the interpreter, or, uh https://hastebin.com/ugipafojih.py
[00:26:36] <buttsbot> hastebin
[00:26:46] <dimadima> which is both the interpreter and that test
[00:27:07] <imode> yeah there's no frontend so you can't load code from files yet.
[00:27:38] <imode> I need to split up the DSL I'm using, the interpreter and the compiler up.
[00:30:35] <imode> if you like later I can walk you through how I'm generating the inc and dec stuff, but I hog this channel too much.
[00:32:50] <dimadima> oh man if it weren't this week i would jump on the opportunity, but i am in the midst of launching a product i've been working on for a long time
[00:33:02] <imode> fun!
[00:33:04] <dimadima> i'm doing some twitter advertising right now, for example. it's pretty fascinating
[00:33:34] <dimadima> i don't they mone to advertise in the US or similar places, so i'm checking out eastern europe/former USSR

[00:39:25] <dimadima> it's a non-instant messenger

[00:40:56] <imode> huh. that's quite nice.
[00:41:16] <imode> does this have a messaging backend?
[00:41:20] <imode> like, its own.
[00:41:40] <dimadima> what do you mean by "messaging"? i'm running a backend, yeah
[00:42:02] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: that goes back to the earliest version of photoshop
[00:42:15] <ngoldbaum> it would refuse to print, certainly
[00:42:19] <dimadima> imode: the backend is postgres/hasura
[00:42:24] <ngoldbaum> it wouldn’t outright refuse to open it
[00:42:34] <ngoldbaum> or let you include images of banknotes in a project
[00:42:37] <ngoldbaum> that’s new
[00:42:55] <imode> dimadima: interesting. what's your delivery mechanism/how do you handle the mass-broadcast problem.
[00:42:55] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: i've never opened an image of money in PS, going back to the 90s
[00:43:16] <imode> do you need an active TCP connection or somethin'.
[00:43:28] <imode> ngoldbaum: wtf?
[00:44:24] <dimadima> imode: there's an "agent" running that performs delivery every 30 minutes (aka times when messages might become "deliverable")

[00:46:31] <imode> ngoldbaum: photoshop is pretty smart. this image is technically unlawful.
[00:46:50] <dimadima> imode: thanks. if you have any criticism / confusion from the landing page, as someone who's just seeing this for the first time, it would greatly appreciate it.
[00:46:57] <ngoldbaum> the USG should sue getty
[00:47:10] <Brekkjern> imode: But who the fuck appointed Photoshop to be judge and jury?
[00:47:36] <imode> Brekkjern: now you have me wondering whether adobe got pulled into court.
[00:48:17] <imode> I wonder what would happen if you blocked out the top three bills in that example getty images image.
[00:48:27] <imode> what is the minimum viable edit to make that image openable.
[00:48:41] <imode> and does that minimal viable edit result in an image that's conformant with the US legal code.
[00:51:07] <Brekkjern> Imagine the US Treasury Department trying to design new bills and not being able to do it because Photoshop are being assholes :P
[00:51:17] <dimadima> photoshop not letting you mess with money is extremely inane
[00:53:21] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: they get the Good Photoshop

[01:15:02] <dimadima> i'm surprised apple hasn't issued a C&D against that

[07:03:34] <indigo> Someone trying to hack you? :P
[07:03:55] <dimadima> naa that's some debug crap i committed by accident
[07:05:25] <dimadima> i like to prefix debug logs with unique keymash that makes it easy to grep and remove. but sometimes i commit it by accident
[07:05:49] <indigo> Perfect
[07:08:48] <dimadima> exactly, now i can find it :)
[07:09:22] <dimadima> i wonder how getting hacked would go
[07:09:28] <dimadima> how will it happen
[07:10:00] <dimadima> it would be terrible, but in some respects it would be an honor to get hacked
[07:10:55] <dimadima> i mean, unless it's just total bullshit
[07:11:09] <dimadima> that would only be terrible
[07:12:56] <dimadima> that's what i like about GKE, though. my fav thing is kubectl port-forward
[07:13:15] <dimadima> no need to fuck with firewalls to get at things
[07:13:56] <dimadima> everything declared in ingress, and if i need to get at something through the back door, it's trivial with `kubectl port-forward`
[07:15:10] <dimadima> so i won't get hacked because i left some ports open by accident
[07:15:23] <dimadima> at least i don't think i will

[17:13:20] <gerikson> is openGL proprietary?
[17:15:50] <gwozniak> The name suggests otherwise, but I have no idea
[17:16:43] <companion_cube> isn't there a group aroudn it? Kronos or something?
[17:19:28] <ngoldbaum> the API code is licensed under a BSD-ish license
[17:19:46] <ngoldbaum> to call it OpenGL you need to license the trademark from chronos group though

[17:37:07] <dimadima> gerikson: thanks for sharing that
[17:37:46] <dimadima> were you going to submit that to HN or you nursing that 888?
[17:39:39] <dimadima> In his old age, when asked in court whether a defendant was of sound mind, he replied: "I never saw any human being who was of sound mind".
[17:39:42] <dimadima> heh
[17:39:53] <dimadima> Pressed further by the judge, he simply added: "I presume the Deity is of sound mind, and He alone".
[17:40:18] <gerikson> pretty sure I can agree

[17:50:43] <dimadima> i just didn't see anything in that article about him making a recovery

[17:51:44] <gerikson> well his family and 2 doctors
[17:53:40] <dimadima> my grandma was like that in old age
[17:53:57] <dimadima> she thought the NSA and "obama" were listening in on her calls because she was an immigrant

[18:01:36] <dimadima> you feed the rats to the cat and the cats to the rats and you get the karma for nothin!
[18:01:43] <dimadima> companion_cube: yeah lol
[18:02:01] <dimadima> i recalled the term by searching HN for "pizza"
[18:02:12] <dimadima> weird how the mind works
[18:02:49] <companion_cube> ah yes, like in the Silicon Valley show with pizza arbitrage? :p
[18:02:56] <companion_cube> (except they re-sell cheaper)
[18:03:15] <dimadima> hahah i haven't seen Silicon Valley but there was that post about fucking Doordash
[18:03:31] <dimadima> #1 result for "pizza" in HN search cause it was wildly popular
[18:03:46] <companion_cube> oof
[18:03:49] <dimadima> gerikson: what do you think is the best time to do a show HN
[18:03:56] <dimadima> well, that question goes to anybody
[18:04:17] <ngoldbaum> 10:00 AM PT on a weekday that’s not a holiday
[18:04:26] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: but then i miss europe?
[18:04:39] <dimadima> sort of?
[18:04:45] <ngoldbaum> 10:00 AM CET then
[18:05:02] <dimadima> european people are more critical though, maybe i want to miss them?
[18:05:23] <ngoldbaum> i would expect most of HNs audience to be in the US
[18:05:36] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: jokes aside, why you think that time, if for any specific reason
[18:06:06] <ngoldbaum> people will be at work but late enough they’re procrastinating by looking at HN
[18:06:09] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: maybe but if you look early like 4AM eastern, it's distinctly european, with a distinctly different vibe
[18:07:01] <dimadima> 10AM central/pacific they're procrastinating too?
[18:08:01] <dimadima> heh todsacerdoti probably is a bot

[18:57:22] <ngoldbaum> wouldn’t your PM want it to launch because it’s the only way they can get a promotion?
[18:57:48] <ngoldbaum> or maybe the corporate politics have gotten so convoluted that it’s in their interest to sabotage their own project
[18:58:08] <indigo> Everyone on my team is deathly afraid of escalations, even though we've never had one

[20:57:00] <dimadima> i don't know what it is

[21:10:14] <dimadima> indigo: i tried 2>1
[21:10:19] <dimadima> erm 2>&1
[21:10:40] <dimadima> no effect... the weird thing is the first pipe works fine
[21:10:50] <dimadima> if you just do one pipe, whether `grep` or `cut`, it works
[21:10:57] <dimadima> one you add the second pipe, it stops producing output!

[21:34:30] <dimadima> ah
[21:34:38] <imode> allo.

[21:35:31] <imode> a giant pile of java.
[21:39:16] <dimadima> been wondering "could it be java" lol
[21:39:50] <dimadima> on some recently amazon thread on HN someone said an AWS service they worked on, a key part of it was a 1,000 line function
[21:39:52] *** Quits: sth (~seth@sys-v.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:40:02] <dimadima> in a java class
[21:40:28] <imode> there's.. many... instances of that.
[21:41:01] <Brekkjern> I debugged some Python code that was very obviously written by a Java dev. It was difficult to read the code through all the tears :(
[21:41:51] <dimadima> bad devs and bad dev situations give java such a bad rap
[21:41:57] <Brekkjern> I mean... The entire program ran through the constructor of an object :S
[21:42:01] <imode> I agree with that, dimadima.
[21:43:32] <Brekkjern> Absolutely. It also shows that it's one of the most popular languages that universities teach
[21:43:34] <dimadima> Brekkjern: what do you mean ranthrough
[21:44:15] <Brekkjern> You know how sometimes you'd make a main() function and run that?
[21:44:23] <imode> oh god.
[21:44:39] <Brekkjern> They didn't do that... They put the stuff you'd put into main() and made a class Main(): and ran it all through it's constructor
[21:44:45] <Brekkjern> So it would never exit the constructor....
[21:45:01] <imode> now I'm wondering what the fuck that'd look like from an execution standpoint.
[21:45:08] <Brekkjern> I mean... It worked
[21:45:33] <Brekkjern> It made my eyes hurt, but it worked...
[21:45:59] <imode> yeah but.. it makes me wonder if there are optimization problems around that, like will you experience a performance degredation..
[21:46:03] <imode> I don't... think you will?
[21:46:21] <Brekkjern> I don't think there would be any performance issues
[21:46:30] <dimadima> Brekkjern: you wouldn't want to do that in java either :/
[21:46:44] <Brekkjern> Except if some optimization passes couldn't be done because it never exited or something like that
[21:46:44] <imode> yeah you wouldn't. you'd want a static method on a class.
[21:46:52] <dimadima> yeah lol
[21:46:58] <Brekkjern> They emulated that too...
[21:47:09] <imode> I mean technically the constructor is a "static method".
[21:47:50] <Brekkjern> They couldn't just set variables with their "constants", so they made a class that contained a lot of constants and instantiated that class every time they needed one of those constants...
[21:48:13] <imode> hAH

[21:49:11] <dimadima> yikes

[21:49:37] <imode> oh right.
[21:49:41] <dimadima> or replicate something they saw somewhere and not sure why
[21:49:48] <imode> python doesn't do that optimization.
[21:50:01] <imode> frequently constructed objects that aren't parameterized don't get set aside.
[21:50:03] <Brekkjern> I mean... You are explicitly asking for a new instance of something
[21:50:19] <imode> yeah. but you could cache a single instance on certain access patterns.
[21:50:24] <Brekkjern> Sure
[21:51:27] <Brekkjern> You could also just _NOT_ do that

[21:56:13] <dimadima> i believe there was something gender-related, which could be been the issue
[22:13:48] <imode> time to write a bitwise circular buffer.

[22:20:23] <imode> nah.
[22:20:34] <imode> for FV3.
[22:21:00] <dimadima> oh okay makes more sense
[22:25:42] <Xe> nas is online
[22:25:49] <Xe> zfs reports 21TB of disk
[22:25:54] <imode> ayyy.
[22:26:38] <ben> zraid?
[22:27:18] <ben> i have 19T full on my zpool :s
[22:27:57] <imode> is ZFS stable on *nix.
[22:28:01] <imode> or do I have to run FreeNAS.
[22:28:09] <imode> I'm stuck with this shitty Synology thing.
[22:29:51] <ben> mine's on debian with zfs-on-linux
[22:30:02] <ben> works fine
[22:33:35] <Xe> ben: raidz1 on nixos
[22:34:16] <ben> i forget what raidz1 means lol
[22:34:24] <ben> i figured it would be nix for you
[22:37:26] <Xe> raidz1 is raid 5 iirc
[22:42:31] <ben> ok that makes sense

[23:24:19] <gerikson> wtf is this https://lobste.rs/s/moflv5/freebsd_audio_from_perspective_happy#c_1js6us
[23:24:20] <buttsbot> FreeBSD audio from a perspective of a happy user | Lobsters
[23:24:24] <gerikson> I have ifconfig
[23:24:29] <gerikson> on lulnix
[23:31:32] <gwozniak> I found audio on FreeBSD to be okay, but it never detected headphone insertion and such things
[23:41:34] <dimadima> isn't headphone insertion sort of a niche thing
[23:45:43] <kline> niche? it works on like 99% of devices on the market these days
[23:46:26] <kline> windows, mac, android, linux+pa, etc all support automatically re-routing audio and adjusting levels on headphone insert/remove
[23:48:45] <dimadima> always kind of assumed it was a mac feature
[23:48:49] <dimadima> mac/iphone
[23:49:04] <dimadima> how universal of a term is "FAQ"
[23:49:18] <dimadima> will non-native speakers know what it means?
[23:51:00] <companion_cube> wdym "insertion"
[23:51:09] <companion_cube> like, plugging headphones into jack?
[23:51:35] <cb> headphone insertion is table stakes
[23:51:42] <cb> especially for a laptop or modern desktop
[23:51:47] <dimadima> companion_cube: yeah that's how i understood it
[23:52:17] <dimadima> good to know!
[23:52:47] <dimadima> first device i had that detected headphones was the iphone 4s, i think
[23:53:06] <dimadima> if they came out, the audio would pause. which was pretttty cool
[23:55:56] <companion_cube> not having that is crazy
[23:57:27] <dimadima> you know what's crazy? android doesn't let you navigate forward with a swipe
[23:57:58] <dimadima> i thought firefox was broken. turns out the behavior is the same in chrome. and all of android
[23:58:21] <dimadima> please correct me if i'm wrong
