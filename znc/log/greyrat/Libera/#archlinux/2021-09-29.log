[04:14:39] <susi> I prefer CLI/TUI
[04:14:39] <bparker> you might need to install it then
[04:14:51] <bparker> there's probably a way to do it with CLI but I don't know how
[04:15:07] <susi> thanks for the suggestion
[04:15:42] <seanicus> im sorry, what exactly is the problem?
[04:16:02] <seanicus> its just the audio is all weird?
[04:16:10] <susi> that audio gets distorted after 5 secs every time, and the issue started yesterday
[04:16:33] <seanicus> I would guess that's interferecne or something.  that happens to me occasionally.  it usually goes away shortly andif it doesnt then i disconnect
[04:16:50] <seanicus> i just put a one line script in my bin (or really you can use an alias): bluetoothctl connect 74:45:CE:78:2B:7E

[04:16:51] <susi> this does not go away, and happens every time now that it started happening
[04:17:09] <seanicus> so maybe you can set up a keybinding that disconnects and reconnects your specific device with bluetoothctl
[04:17:13] <susi> it goes away for 5 secs if I reconnect

[04:17:44] <seanicus> Hmm.  Have you troubleshooted it?  Tried it with another computer?
[04:18:07] <susi> I've tried it with a phone, no distortion 
[04:18:26] <susi> I'm asking how to debug it further as it seems to be spesific to this computer/installation

[04:25:54] <seanicus> at least for a regular desktop user
[04:26:11] <susi> if I could see some connection details there should be something informational at the moment the audio gets fcked

[05:18:51] <jfu> in this case it is qemu-img that was compiled with libnettle.so.7 but arch only has libnettle.so.8
[05:19:08] <jfu> so i guess it is the qemu package
[05:20:01] <jfu> if you have qemu-img on your machine, try to run it and you will probably be able to reproduce it

[06:15:39] <KStarling_> Well, I tried manually suspending and waking while leaving the libinput event viewer running in terminal. No input data appears to have been generated, and now the touchpad is unresponsive again.
[06:16:12] <KStarling_> Everything I've read about libinput says that all configuration has to be done from within applications using libinput, such as the desktop environment. But the only config gnome offers is basic "how fast do you want the pointer to move" stuff.

[07:45:31] <MacGyver> (Also #archlinux-offtopic exists)
[07:45:32] <SigmaWP> like "came later in a temporal sense" but not "at the same level"

[07:49:42] <MacGyver> As in, your reader won't understand.

[07:50:01] <SigmaWP> [21:15:35] <SigmaWP> you wouldn't say that "kant was the successor of plato"
[07:50:23] <mpan> Yes, because “successor” implies being literally the next element.
[07:50:40] <MacGyver> Well it really depends on what you want to communicate. Kant was inspired by Plato, perhaps?
[07:50:44] <mpan> But you asked about temporal sense and same level… this is the part I don’t get.
[07:50:50] <MacGyver> Or built on the teachings of Plato?

[07:52:38] <mpan> SigmaWP: descendant?
[07:53:02] <SigmaWP> descendant sounds kind of like parental
[07:53:13] <mpan> Though I would still not say that about Kant and Plato specifically.
[07:53:18] <MacGyver> I'm somewhat puzzled by the need for a word that communicates this.
[07:53:42] <SigmaWP> yeah i guess i could figure out how to rephrase
[07:53:44] <MacGyver> As in, I'd probably structure the sentence such that it is clear without having to explicitly say this.
[07:54:06] <MacGyver> In a way, my previous suggestions already imply that chronologically, Kant came after.
[07:54:54] <MacGyver> And if not, a simple structure of "In the school of X, Plato stated that Y. Later, Kant ...."

[12:05:54] <mpan> You mean partition table? If it’s a single filesystem, it may even be created on the drive itself. But for flexibility I would still go for partitions. And whichever partition table you choose is IMO unimportant for that situation.

[14:43:47] <mpan> What command do you consider to “open”?
[14:44:09] <onemu> mpan: "cd"
[14:44:44] <susi> you have typoed most probably
[14:44:59] <mpan> The full command you are invoking. So far it seems you are either in a wrong directory or attempting to use a different name.
[14:45:34] <mpan> In particular you mentioned “navigated to /etc”… which implies you were not there earlier. From which I guess the path is wrong.
[14:46:42] <andi_> anybody can recommend a merge tool with a 4-way merge so that i see base, mine, theirs and the result?
[14:47:27] <onemu> mpan: i was in /etc and did "ls" and modprobe.d was there yet when i cd to it it said it's not..

[14:48:20] <mpan> But, as susi said (and what I asked already)… the exact command is needed.
[14:48:30] <mpan> onemu: please, copy-paste it here. :)
[14:48:34] <mpan> onemu: or tab-complete.
[14:49:02] <onemu> mpan: i'm on windows, my arch laptop doesn't have and irc client, lol
[14:49:35] <mpan> Then we can only guess. And our guess… well, already repeated a few times by both susi and me. =D
[14:49:37] <susi> as said, you mis-spelled, typoed. it's that simple
[14:49:44] <andi_> baltazar: yeah, but i cannot recommend vim. i need something more main stream like kdiff3 but i don't think kdiff3 is active any more?
[14:50:19] <mpan> I am not saying it’s impossible for something to go wrong in other way, but it’s really hard to guess what without being able to debug that directly. And chances are microscopic.
[14:50:38] <onemu> ok sorry guys, i'm still a linux noob haha
[14:50:56] <bea> what's the objective?
[14:51:14] <onemu> also, when i open termina next to my username after the @ it has like a long ID, what is that?

[18:03:17] <cyphertite> hmmh, not sure what is causing jessicant's flickering issue, but what I see with the 4K display on my KDE i7/16 Gb optimus laptop is that *only* when it overheats, the entire screen begins 'flashing' from a legible screen to some horrible, illegible white/grey mess (several times per second).  At that point, it becomes impossible to read/choose the options 'displayed'.  The only choice in my
[18:03:19] <cyphertite> case is to hard poweroff - and wait a few minutes.

[23:51:50] <NetSysFire> its blockdevice naming
[23:52:05] <NetSysFire> sda1/sdb1 is not persistent so use UUIDs instead
