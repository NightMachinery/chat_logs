[11:05:45] <SteelRose> GrandPa-G: use ssh keys
[11:05:55] <SteelRose> passwords are obsolete :-)
[11:06:10] <rk4> you can specify the user in the rsync dest, `man rsync`
[11:06:12] <GrandPa-G> I have to work with what is not what should be
[11:06:54] <GrandPa-G> rk4, good thought. I can log into sender with putty that remembers password and push. thanks
[11:07:27] <SteelRose> GrandPa-G: or you can always run a chown after the rsync / scp has finished to set the right ownership
[11:08:02] <GrandPa-G> SteelRose, there multiple owners, multiple groups, way to hard to do manually.
[11:08:12] <alkisg> GrandPa-G: putty? Is the sender Windows? I don't think you want to keep permissions then :D
[11:08:34] <GrandPa-G> alkisg, no, just a tool to ssh into either server
[11:08:51] <alkisg> OK. Remember that you'll probably need to generated ssh keys and copy them to the root on the receiver
[11:09:05] <alkisg> Because usually, root ssh is prohibited, and even root account logins have no password
[11:09:13] <alkisg> That's not hard to do, it's just 2 commands
[11:09:21] <alkisg> Try: ssh root@receiver
[11:09:29] <alkisg> If you can do it, OK. If not, you'll need ssh keys.

[17:46:02] <TJ-> webchat67: transferring /usr/ is entirely possible. Are you sure this is just /usr/ and not the entire root file-system you wish to relocate? Oftentimes what people do is keep root file-system (/) and home (/home/) in separate file-systems. Root file-system indeed does not need a lot of space. I typically have separate / (<16GB) /var/ (<20GB) and /home/ (asmuch as required)

[21:44:44] <TJ-> GrandPa-G: is there a "-j DROP" as the last rule?
[21:45:35] <GrandPa-G> TJ-, if iptables -S shows all the rules, then there is no drop
[21:46:58] <TJ-> GrandPa-G: then there is nothing in the firewall to refuse any connections and even your ACCEPT for port 7000 isn't required
[21:47:38] <TJ-> GrandPa-G: I thought you either had a default policy of DROP on the INPUT chain, or a final rule sending all packets not previously matching an ACCEPT rule being DROPed
[21:48:31] <GrandPa-G> TJ-, I was afraid I did it correctly. I had the VM (Azure) admin set these up from the outside and he did 3 rules. One of them is working. It looks the same on the vm. Thanks
[21:48:45] <TJ-> GrandPa-G: in which case, because your quoted rule(s) for port 7000 only match on --state NEW you'd also need a conntrack rule to match other states, as in "iptables -I INPUT -i ${interface} -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT"
