[00:38:21] <nickdiazswag209> when writing a bash script, whats the difference between running a command, and running a command using "exec"
[00:38:35] <greycat> exec replaces the shell with the new command
[00:42:10] <nickdiazswag209> whats an example when we would want to use something like that vs just running the command without exec

[00:44:50] <nickdiazswag209> if we dont use "exec" to run the command in a wrapper script, what would be bad about that? whatever we want to execute would also run right? i guess it would just run as a subprocess of bash?

[05:03:13] <pandoxer> if I do it before the git status function it works, but I want my lambda to be the last character
[05:03:43] <e36freak> PROMPT_COMMAND won't affect it

[05:04:05] <e36freak> so have PROMPT_COMMAND assign to a variable, then use that variable in your prompt
[05:04:11] <pandoxer> I set PS1 directly, with `function_name` in its value
[05:04:22] <pandoxer> backticks included
[05:04:32] <e36freak> as an aside, backticks blow goats
[05:04:35] <e36freak> !`
[05:04:36] <greybot> The backquote (`) is used in the old-style command substitution, e.g. foo=`command`. The foo=$(command) syntax is recommended instead. Backslash handling inside $() is less surprising, and $() is easier to nest. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082
[05:04:47] <pandoxer> hmm
[05:04:47] <e36freak> ` is deprecated. anyway,
[05:04:53] <pandoxer> I had no idea, thanks for pointing out
[05:05:01] <greycat> Backticks are horrible, and even if you upgrade to the 2000s and use $() it's still forking a process every time your prompt is shown.
[05:05:17] <e36freak> i'd have your function set a variable and put it in PROMPT_COMMAND
[05:05:21] <e36freak> then use that variable in your PS1
[05:05:27] <larryv> baaaaaa
[05:05:28] <pandoxer> makes sense
[05:05:41] <greycat> but then again, if you're one of these insane git people who call git multiple times every time the prompt is shown, each of those is a fork....
[05:05:58] <pandoxer> I actually use romkatv's gitstatus for most of it
[05:06:20] <pandoxer> my custom function is to display a √ character if the repo is "clean"
[05:06:53] <pandoxer> but my function printfs stuff when called :(
[05:07:19] <pandoxer> and it's being called in a forked process, since it's wrapped in backticks right?
[05:07:46] <greycat> `` and $() both create a subshell, which is a forked process, yes

[05:08:57] <greycat> if you're calling git *anyway*, you may not notice the delay of additional forks
[05:09:15] <e36freak> probbaly not
[05:09:24] <greycat> you must be accustomed to your prompt taking a noticeable amount of time to appear, and if you can live with that, fine
[05:09:36] <pandoxer> it's pretty fast, tbh
[05:10:02] <pandoxer> I think romkatv/gitstatus has a background deamon or something

[06:09:40] <greybot> useless use of greybot
[06:09:54] <wiscii> i was going for grep but meh
[06:11:31] <nightstrike> wiscii: You're highlighting that I'm using grep when I don't need to?
[06:11:43] <nightstrike> kinda like...  cat file | grep word ?
[06:11:54] <wiscii> yes
[06:11:58] <larryv> !grepawk
[06:11:58] <greybot> Awk can do almost everything grep can do. Instead of doing grep 'foo' | awk '{ statement }', try awk '/foo/{ statement }'
[06:12:05] <nightstrike> I mean, I can appreciate self improvement, that's why I'm asking and learning
[06:12:12] <wiscii> larryv: pointed it out
[06:12:21] *** evanextreme is now known as evanextreme[away
[06:12:28] <wiscii> as if by magic
[06:12:31] <nightstrike> yeah, and I thanked him for it :)
[06:12:56] <wiscii> all guud :)
[06:14:08] <wiscii> nightstrike: i was more curious what greybot had on the subject
[06:14:13] <nightstrike> ah
[06:14:59] <wiscii> turns out, it's covered ;-)

[19:24:05] <Lebela> hi
[19:24:12] <Lebela> I am in a bit of a trouble.
[19:24:31] <Lebela> My bash script heavily relies on the accuracy of the file's "modified" time
[19:24:50] <Lebela> However, many files which I copied over from one system to an other have now wrong timestamps
[19:25:00] *** Quits: Inline (~Inline@2a02:908:1252:7a80::1aa) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[19:25:11] <Lebela> the "modified" date is off by 2 hours
[19:25:48] <Lebela> doing it manually with the touch command would be a nightmare (450+ files)
[19:26:15] <Lebela> can I somehow create a script that just subtracts 2 hours from every file's modified time?
[19:26:28] <Lebela> I am 90% sure, also "created" and "changed" are affected
[19:26:45] <Lebela> however, I can only know for sure about the modified date as I took a screenshot of the directory before copying them

[22:52:18] <larryv> !html
[22:52:18] <greybot> You can't parse tag-based languages like HTML or XML using bash, grep, sed, cut, etc. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/113 instead.
[22:52:19] <ash_worksi> that wont cry over the differences between html and xml like xmllint will

[23:06:55] <Patsie> the example shows that I'm trying to pass all files in a folder 'effects/*' as arguments to an awk script
