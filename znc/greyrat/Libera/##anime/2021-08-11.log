[01:43:24] <ButterNoodle> yea there are some intels that dont have built in graphics also
[01:43:32] <Bco1981> F
[01:43:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah but Intel is overpriced shit in general
[01:43:44] <ButterNoodle> meh there is value

[01:44:11] <Bco1981> Aurora_v_kosmose: 11600K vs 5600X... tough choice
[01:44:14] <ButterNoodle> I have yet to cook an intel
[01:44:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Proper cooling also prevents that just fine.
[01:44:31] <MootPoot> I've cooked 2 AMDs, and 3 intels
[01:44:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I've never had an issue with AMD. I've had a lot of such issues with Intel.
[01:44:41] <MootPoot> although the intels were all laptops
[01:44:45] <ButterNoodle> you always say that... insinuating that improper use leads to failure
[01:44:47] <Bco1981> MootPoot: get some proper cooling man
[01:44:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Intel laptops especially are just terrible.
[01:44:57] <MootPoot> 1 amd was a athlon x4
[01:44:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But one could probably remove the Intel qualifier
[01:45:01] <MootPoot> other was a r7 1700
[01:45:02] <Bco1981> oh... laptops can't be helped.
[01:45:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Laptops in general suck. A lot.
[01:45:10] <MootPoot> which I cooked by running a high OC for 3 years
[01:45:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: They could. Manufacturers are crippling them for no good reason.
[01:45:25] <ButterNoodle> show me a business laptop that isnt a slab of shit running amd tho?
[01:45:36] <Bco1981> Aurora_v_kosmose: the proble with laptops is that they don't suck... enough.
[01:45:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> "But it's thin" I don't give a shit, give me a fucking briefcase-thick thing that I cannot overheat and which has decent IO.
[01:45:44] <Bco1981> problem*
[01:45:47] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle:  its gonna take a while for that
[01:45:52] <ButterNoodle> plenty of gaming laptops.. that are generally bad no matter the slug
[01:45:54] <MootPoot> since business consumers dont liek changing things
[01:46:09] <MootPoot> amd has started making good laptop cpus
[01:46:16] <ButterNoodle> yea MootPoot, there's a reason intel is in the datacenters and on the desktops
[01:46:19] <MootPoot> but they havent gotten into the upper market yet
[01:46:22] <Bco1981> Aurora_v_kosmose: lol that's exactly the way i wan't my laptop :D
[01:46:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Having a laptop be a few inches thick shouldn't matter since anyone that has a choice in the matter will use an external screen and keyboard instead of their shitty self-destructing ones.
[01:46:46] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle:  because they used anti-business practices to buy out contracts and force other companies to use intel and not amd
[01:47:00] <MootPoot> they actually had exlusivity deals
[01:47:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Getting >6 cores with AMD at a decent price is feasible. It's impossible with Intel.
[01:47:22] <ButterNoodle> guess they were the only smart chip maker..
[01:47:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And we're no longer in 2003, programs now actually do use multiple cores.

[09:45:27] <sentionics> Never had that done myself, but I'd certainly want to be sedated for it. Not fun.
[09:46:16] <amigojapan> sentionics: no idea. I am j just waiting outside
[09:48:10] <sentionics> amigojapan: best of luck, hopefully, it's nothing too major. Too many possibilities to really speculate, which wouldn't really help a lot anyway. Best to just relax.
[09:48:17] <sentionics> *try to relax
[09:48:38] <amigojapan> Thanks sentionics 
[09:49:38] <amigojapan> I was going to pick up my salary today. I am really low on funds. Guess I will have to take money out of the bank
[09:49:49] <CyberTailor> omg. characters in stone ocean anime trailer look even more gay than in manga
[09:51:05] <amigojapan> The ambulance guy remembered us from like a year ago when we called an ambulance
[09:54:25] <sentionics> amigojapan: Interesting, guess it's nice to see a familiar face during an otherwise stressful moment.
[09:55:37] <amigojapan> sentionics: unless he was implying we call ambulances too much
[09:56:18] <sentionics> lol, well, if it's a guy you only saw last year, that'd be a rather awful implication to make.
[09:56:33] <amigojapan> Yeah
[09:56:55] <sentionics> and awful in general. If someone needs emergency care a lot, well, that's just how it is. Not everyone is super healthy.

[09:57:08] <amigojapan> Right
[09:58:04] <sentionics> Though in my case, I do feel quite a bit of shame when I find myself in the ER when coming down after a week long binge (and lack any benzos to endure it at home)
[09:58:43] <sentionics> haven't had an episode of that in months, and hopefully would like to not need to do it anymore.
[10:00:11] <sentionics> hangovers hit me unusually hard in general it seems, yet I nonetheless got addicted and take it to extremes.

[10:02:36] <amigojapan> sentionics: it seems some problem in her nose was the cause

[10:06:58] <sentionics> Ouch, did it happen after a sneeze?
[10:07:16] <amigojapan> No sentionics 
[10:21:02] <sentionics> amigojapan: didn't find much from google searching. Best I could find were nasal tears, not sure if that's what they mean.
[10:29:56] <sentionics> amigojapan: I'm going to sleep for now. Hope things resolve well for Tomako. Waiting around at the hospital isn't fun also, so hope it's not too bad of a wait. Later, man.

[18:48:36] <berlin36> :o
[18:48:37] <gline> or remove the case and measure the voltage over the led

[19:10:56] <berlin36> I even have a 0$ xmr wallet
[19:11:20] <berlin36> ButterNoodle, idk mate, darkweb is just a boring side of the internet, nothing too cool there
[19:11:35] <gline> does monero still keep a full history of transactions? e.g. if someone finds a vulnerability in 5years can all transaction be possibly be decrypted?
[19:11:52] <berlin36> No
[19:11:57] <berlin36> It's not like btc
[19:12:21] <ButterNoodle> everything today will eventually can be decrypted sometime in the future
[19:12:26] <ButterNoodle> is someone cares enough
[19:12:30] <berlin36> Btc is transparent, you can see every transaction
[19:12:40] <berlin36> ButterNoodle:  i never actually thought about that
[19:12:46] <ButterNoodle> yea
[19:12:54] <gline> i know. my question is just is the info inevitably lost in monero, or merely encrypted?

[19:15:31] <ButterNoodle> hard to rob a bank of all their bitcoins... 
[19:15:37] <gline> u sure?
[19:15:38] <Sadale> The idea of BTC is genius. But they you got all those copycats that adds no value to the world and people keep dumping their money into them

[23:01:31] <holorum> Doesn't Stadia as a whole?
[23:02:12] <Sxem> well, im always out of hd space, so i like having games that take up no space
[23:03:01] <Sxem> also, i think it plays them maxxed out and my pc wd probably just do high settings
[23:03:03] <isekaijin> HDDs are cheap enough. Buy more if you need more space.
[23:03:37] <Sxem> im sure i will cancel it after the 3 free months
[23:04:14] <holorum> You can get pretty big hard drives for not that much money. Also: you can just have 3-5 games at a time installed.
[23:04:54] <holorum> I mostly play indie titles myself, so the biggest game I've encountered in recent times was Umineko with its 2.5 GiB.
