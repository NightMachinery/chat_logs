[08:18:37] <CoJaBo> Most of what I maintain is PHP
[08:18:39] <adiabatic> in the meantime, Google itself didn't _really_ need generics, so they were able to drag their feet on it
[08:18:43] <kiboneu> good morning
[08:18:51] <mst> gwern: I'd argue it wasn't so much a mistake as "we can't work out to do this in a way that satisfies our version of 'simplicity'"
[08:19:00] <adiabatic> what mst said
[08:19:20] <mst> plus go was designed to throw lots of fresh college grad hires at
[08:19:43] <rmmh> I have made a lot of money writing go code so my opinions may be suspect
[08:20:14] <gwern> hm, so go's been out for 12 years now huh? that long now... you know, I feel like there was a period there where it seemed like a lot of new prog langs were coming out from big tech, like go, swift, kotlin, hack, a few others. has that died down or am I just not paying as much attention to PLT as I used to
[08:20:25] <CoJaBo> Also, apparently PHP doesn't support Brotli
[08:20:33] <mst> so having them write repetitive code wasn't really a problem whereas letting them write complicated code they needed to not screw it up was much riskier
[08:20:52] <adiabatic> gwern: all WWDC sessions use Swift examples only and they haven't had Objective-C examples for ages now
[08:20:58] <mst> rmmh: go is Not My Thing but I appreciate the way it picked its trade-offs up front and leaned into them *hard*
[08:21:26] <gwern> adiabatic: didn't say apple'd abandoned swift, anymore than google abandoned go
[08:21:35] <rmmh> mst: it's a good execution of a very basic language
[08:21:41] <adiabatic> right, but it's not sexy nor new

[08:22:17] <gwern> just wondering if there was a reason for what looked like a sudden burst of new langs and then a bust... was it a phase in FANG growth? was it downstream of the mobile paradigm shift?
[08:22:22] <rmmh> nothing significant in the last 5 years
[08:22:24] <gwern> maybe it was just a fad
[08:22:47] <gwern> oh yes, Rust
[08:22:55] <rmmh> I think you need a certain amount of built up frustration with your current generation of languages to support the ecosystem for a new one
[08:23:14] <adiabatic> seems like everyone got sick of C at the same time
[08:23:16] <gwern> julia continues chugging along, not sure about all the JS transpilers... is dart dead?
[08:23:29] <rmmh> a lot of this seemed to converge on ~2010 with Go/Rust/Typescript -- all significant new languages -- being released
[08:23:32] <gwern> 'bosque'? now that's a new one
[08:23:39] <adiabatic> typescript is the big hotness in to-JS compilers

[08:23:53] <mst> rmmh: I suspect that for the things go is generally used for, I would prefer to be writing nim, but I suspect that writing such things in go is a better idea just because of the "people potentially won't take software in that space seriously if it *isn't* written in go" factor
[08:23:58] <adiabatic> I think the only thing that uses Dart is sass, the stylesheet transmogrifier

[08:25:33] <rmmh> julia vs numpy basically
[08:25:40] <rmmh> (vs matlab)
[08:26:02] <mst> adiabatic: classes, static typing, threading, macros, custom operators, native code, WASM, transpile-to-JS
[08:26:09] <gwern> rmmh: yeah, chugging along. still no breakout moment or killer app, but it's doing well for an underdog struggling against the odds and network effects and missing out on DL
[08:26:37] <rmmh> python is *the* language for DL eh
[08:26:53] <rmmh> python is the base, and people fight over tensorflow or pytorch or
[08:28:00] <rmmh> I think a new language needs a *big* winning feature to draw people to it from previous ones. D failed because it was C++, just a bit different.
[08:28:09] <gwern> yep, pretty much. DL is a DSL
[08:28:30] <rmmh> Rust is winning over C++ developers because you have similarly powerful abstractions but more safety
[08:28:45] <rmmh> Typescript, the same but for JS
[08:29:01] <rmmh> Julia wins over MATLAB/Python devs by having a *good* JIT
[08:29:04] <gwern> people fight over the DSL but the host lang remains pretty constant. python hasn't been seriously threatened since like 2014. I sometimes think that most of what people liked about tensorflow initially was just that it was hosted in python, so you didn't go 'eww I have to learn lua?'
[08:30:31] <rmmh> Some of these are pretty company-specific and suspect. Does Hack or Reason have users outside of Facebook? The fuck is Ballerina or Bosque?
[08:31:35] <rmmh> In the Bosque project we ask the question of what happens if the IR is designed explicitly to support the rich needs of automated code reasoning, IDE tooling, etc. With this novel IR first perspective we are exploring a new way to think about and build a language intermediate representation and tools that utilize it. Our initial experiments show that this empowers a range of next-generation

[09:47:34] <shawwwn> the few books I found felt like gemstones
[09:47:38] <shawwwn> and it was mostly visual basic nonsense
[09:48:16] <shawwwn> perhaps you feel that everyone has already made everything worth making, so trail blazing is over. Poppeycock, I say

[09:59:30] <saturn2> bicycles are a great example. there hasn't been a significantly better bicycle design invented in my lifetime
[09:59:55] <saturn2> or maybe there has, but nobody uses it or cares, because bicycles are bicycles
[10:00:20] <Obormot\Gaia> Also, bicycles seem to have gotten more expensive
[10:00:27] <Obormot\Gaia> What's up with that
[10:01:28] <rmmh> Tons of demand for bikes during pandemic
[10:01:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> No I mean before
[10:01:46] <quanticle> rmmh: But is Julia winning over Python devs?
[10:01:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, in the period 2000–2020
[10:01:57] <quanticle> I thought the flow was the other way around.
[10:02:16] <PapuaHardyNet> Julia users switch to Python? strange
[10:02:53] <quanticle> saturn2: So if Programming History is over... then when is the Programming 9/11 going to happen
[10:03:02] <quanticle> To restart Programming History
[10:03:14] <quanticle> Is that what's going on right now, with the chip shortage?
[10:03:17] <adiabatic> ahahahahahahahahhaa

[10:20:10] <shawwwn> saturn2: to appeal to your logical side, if it were true that there were no better designs to be had in programming, then nobody would pay for them
[10:20:47] <shawwwn> this clearly isn't true, since it's possible to launch a business powered by an effective new design
[10:21:50] <shawwwn> even if you feel that "so what, some people manage to make money," then here's an example from the opposite side: if you're a kid in school, the quickest way to impress your friends is to do some clever thing that surprises them with computers
[10:22:15] <shawwwn> that's the essence of hacking, in the traditional sense of the word
[10:22:23] <shawwwn> I don't see that being over any time soon
[10:22:53] <shawwwn> and as long as kids are doing that, they'll always go from that to "maybe I'll be the one to make that business, powered by that new design I discovered"

[11:45:19] <quanticle> kuudes: I just heard from a Finnish streamer that y'all learn *four* languages: Finnish, Swedish, English and you get a choice for the fourth
[11:45:21] <quanticle> Is that true?
[11:54:25] <adiabatic> but how many of them stick
[11:55:35] <rsaarelm> quanticle: Finnish and Swedish are mandatory and you need one other, if English is also mandatory now that's been added in the last 20 years.
[11:58:01] <quanticle> rsaarelm: Yeah, this person was saying that Swedish and English are mandatory, and people have to choose one another.
[11:58:14] <quanticle> Popular choices are German and Spanish, apparently.
[11:58:46] <rsaarelm> Looking at some primary school webpage, it does appear there's different sections for English and Other Foreign Language.
[11:59:35] <rsaarelm> Y'know, thinking back I'm not sure Spanish was even a thing in my high school.
[11:59:59] <rsaarelm> There were joke courses for Estonian, Japanese and Latin.
[12:00:57] <rsaarelm> There's different levels for the language, there's the "learn this from elementary school", "learn the other language from junior high", "tertiary language you probably won't learn at all" and "high school joke course"
[12:01:07] <quanticle> Why was Estonian a "joke" course?
[12:01:27] <quanticle> Isn't Estonia pretty close to Finland, and therefore pretty useful for a Finn to know?
[12:01:33] <rsaarelm> Yes and no.
[12:01:41] <rsaarelm> They're economically irrelevant.
[12:02:05] <rsaarelm> Nobody is serious about knowing Estonian.
[12:02:14] <quanticle> Huh. 
[12:02:59] <quanticle> How popular is Russian?
[12:03:11] <rsaarelm> It's complicated, and I don't get the full picture.
[12:03:53] <rsaarelm> There are some people who have Russian as the A-language starting from elemetary school, and there's some insinuation they're the kids of the 1970s Stalin Youth people.
[12:04:25] <rsaarelm> General sentiment is not learning Russian and there's a last century idea of "don't make things any easier for them when they invade" as far as I figure dit.
[12:04:37] <rsaarelm> So it's a non-joke option, but not very popular.
[12:04:49] <rsaarelm> As far as I know, Estonian isn't available as a non-joke option.
[12:04:58] <quanticle> Huh.
[12:05:42] <rsaarelm> Learning Swedish had the geopolitical justification kuudes is a fan of, but kuudes is the only person under 70 I've heard espouse that.
[12:05:47] <ggreer> https://www.mindbloom.com/ apparently you can get ketamine mailed to you if you video chat with a doctor and pay them money
[12:05:47] <Robomot> Mindbloom | Psychedelic Medicine is Here (Mindbloom helps you heal and grow through legal, safe, and clinician-guided ketamine therapy for depression and anxiety. See if you're a candidate today.)
[12:05:50] <quanticle> I guess I'm in a Cold War mindset, because I see learning Russian more as "know your enemy" than "don't make things any easier for them when they invade us"
[12:06:09] <rsaarelm> Ie, align with Western Europe for the cold war blobbing.
[12:07:24] <rsaarelm> Swedish is close to as irrelevant as Estonian in business and culture so the mandatory Swedish lang is a constant piece of friction, people would just pick English and some bigger other language if they got the choice.
[12:07:31] <adiabatic> yeah, but then again, russians invading the US is kind of far-fetch
[12:08:00] <adiabatic> Invading Finland? Well, they can't count on that simo hayha guy again
[12:08:10] <rsaarelm> Fun thing, I had Swedish as the A-language because options were Swedish and English and I knew back then that it'd be even more of a waste of time to study English since you learn it anyway.
[12:08:36] <quanticle> Haha
[12:08:39] <adiabatic> how does the average Finn get ESL for free? Watching TV?
[12:08:39] <quanticle> Well, it worked out for you
[12:08:50] <rsaarelm> And I still can't understand spoken Swedish.
[12:08:51] <quanticle> adiabatic: Remember: they invented IRC
[12:09:00] <adiabatic> or that
[12:09:16] <rsaarelm> Subs instead of dubbing for all TV is the gateway drug, yeah.
[12:09:50] <adiabatic> how much base English do you need to know in order for that to actually be useful
[12:09:53] <rsaarelm> Then having impoverished local media landscape so all computer games, RPG books, comic books, HP Lovecraft short stories and what have you need to be in English.
[12:10:14] <rsaarelm> Computer games around 1990 being text heavy and English only was a big deal.
[12:10:14] <adiabatic> because I've watched some subbed anime and I have picked up basically epsilon Japanese from it
[12:10:40] <rsaarelm> Yeah, but English is everywhere through other channels as well, unlike Japanese.
[12:11:11] <rsaarelm> TV only does give you only the anime weeb level of language proficiency so that's not good enough.
[12:11:23] <quanticle> The only word I know from anime is "naruhodo", and even then I'm pretty sure I *actually* learned what that word meant from nshepperd's usage.
[12:11:26] <rsaarelm> I think people go for internet exposure now.
[12:11:53] <adiabatic> yeah, anime taught me all the important japanese words…hime…tatakai…katana…
[12:12:04] <nshepperd> loll
[12:12:09] <quanticle> What the fuck is a tatakai?
[12:12:10] <rsaarelm> The basic ingredient is still that the language zone is so small that there isn't really a translated stuff environment where you can just stick with the native language.
[12:12:14] <adiabatic> battle
[12:12:17] <quanticle> I see
[12:12:30] <quanticle> Or rather
[12:12:32] <quanticle> naruhodo
[12:12:47] <nshepperd> pachi pachi pachi
[12:12:52] <quanticle> lmao
[12:14:07] <rsaarelm> I wonder where the limit goes, Germany seems to be big enough that they have people getting in trouble when they only consume stuff as German translations.
[12:14:33] <rsaarelm> Japan obviously has it bad.
[12:14:37] <quanticle> Japan is *hard* on the other side, yeah
[12:15:22] <adiabatic> on the other hand, japan seems kind of resistant to the meme of the day being pushed by harvard and yale
[12:15:25] <rsaarelm> But when your population is 10M or below, then I guess you start being closer to the Finland bin where you need to reach for a bigger language sphere.
[12:15:26] <quanticle> When we visited Italy (and granted, we only visited Italian cities) we didn't have *too* much trouble communicating in a combination of English and hand gestures to get directions

[12:16:43] <quanticle> I think economics also plays a role. I was talking to someone returning home to Italy on the flight and he says that learning English is something of a trend, because the job prospects in Italy are poor and so learning English is seen as a necessary prerequisite for economic advancement.
[12:17:16] <quanticle> i.e. if you want to get a job at a multinational, you'd better have at least a working knowledge of English

[12:24:02] <rsaarelm> My dad only has the STEM field, reads and writes English but makes many mistakes when writing. Mom has none of them, distinctly prefers reading non-English stuff. My aunt's a retired schoolteacher and says she can't really read English.
[12:24:55] <rsaarelm> But they all grew up before the time kids had figured English is really important.
[12:30:00] <rsaarelm> Oh, right. Now I remember why English is special. If you have something other than Swedish as your A-language, then you get put on special B-language Swedish classes on 7th grade. If you had Swedish as your A-language, you'll get English classes there.

[12:31:45] <rsaarelm> Also Finnish, other foreign A-language, Swedish, and skip the English? Dunno if they try to force English on you these days.
[12:39:24] <rsaarelm> Also then in high school they just went "y'all know English anyway, just skip to the A-track" at the people who'd been on the B-English track and then we had one pentecostal girl who legit had had zero English exposure other than the B-classes and was kinda pissed.

[12:53:51] <kuudes> basicly, it is an ecosystem thing
[12:54:18] <kuudes> we have teacher teaching for swedish, english, french, german, spanish basicly
[12:54:22] <quanticle> Also the fact that Chinese is hard ot learn. Like harder than English.
[12:54:26] <kuudes> sure
[12:54:39] <kuudes> which is why it would make sense to start it early on elementary
[12:54:58] <kuudes> otoh indeed I have recently grown more suspicious on if chinese would be a good thing for finnish kids
[12:55:18] <kuudes> here in oulu we have some amount of japanese teaching, and japanese exhange stipends etc
[12:55:37] <kuudes> japan seems possibly much closer culturally to finland, and generally maybe more beneficial ally in future than china
[12:55:55] <quanticle> Yeah, but if none of your kids learn Chinese, where are you going to get your future intelligence analysts from?
[12:56:15] <kuudes> thats usa's problem
[12:56:24] <kuudes> china is far away and we are a small country
[12:56:29] * quanticle was listening to a podcast (of course) where there was an old Cold Warrior talking about how, *back in za day* all the cool foreign policy kids learned Russian
[12:56:51] <kuudes> afaik japan was one of the big ally that bailed finland out of 90s depression, so that sounds good for them
[12:57:09] <kuudes> well, if you gaze into the abyss long enough, the abyss gazes back
[12:57:30] <quanticle> And now, as Tanner Greer is showing us, it's actually helpful to know Chinese in order to parse the stuff that the Communist Party doesn't translate and compare their untranslated statements to their translated statements.
[12:58:10] <kuudes> when I went to school (I was maybe the last cold war kids), the presumption was that communist's kids chose russian as A language, westernist's kids chose english and those in-between (few) chose german, not specifying if east or west
[12:58:12] <quanticle> A lot of the CPC's intentions are goals are stated in public unclassified documents that just happen not to be translated into Enlgish
[12:58:16] <quanticle> *English
[12:58:31] <kuudes> yeah
[12:58:46] <kuudes> but geography will mean that russia is the thing for finland
[13:00:24] <kuudes> but yeah, I learned english, swedish, french and german in primary and secondary education
[13:00:42] <kuudes> my french and german are not good though
[13:01:00] <kuudes> but I managed to play pool with a russian dude in canaries using german, as that was the common language
[13:01:58] <kuudes> these days they start english in, hmm, 3rd grade? and swedish in 4th or 5th grade?
[13:02:20] <kuudes> my friend is sami and her kids are also taught that
[13:02:36] <kuudes> that could be politically useful in future I suppose
[13:04:54] <quanticle> Oh yeah, when the Sami populations of Finland, Sweden and Norway start an insurgency to create a unified Samistan :P
[13:08:48] <kuudes> it is still far away, but some younger people there have actually toyed with such an idea, and I feel it is not impossible thing for russia to wedge on

[23:29:11] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: so one thing that I'd like to fix on the index is the automatic layout producing 2-column rather than 3-columns, despite my extensive reorganizing & trimming: https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16295722722610974.png it looks awful to have these big empty gutters and inconsistent 2 vs 3 section layouts

[23:30:19] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: seems like the various paddings and margins and body-widths could be adjusted for /index to reduce that, in a way which would be inappropriate for regular pages
[23:30:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Well, that is a very narrow window
[23:30:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, there's gonna be a width where the third column won't quite fit
[23:31:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> We can adjust what that width is, a little, but it'll still exist
[23:31:13] <rmmh> dbohdan: it's hard to take a language that has breaking syntax changes seriously, especially on basic fundamentals
[23:31:24] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: it's portrait, yes, but it's still like a 4k monitor. this is at 100%, and it generally *looks* to me like a third column could fit comfortably. I've trimmed all of these down to the point where it should be possible, but it's all of the margins and paddings which blow out
[23:32:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: It may look that way, but there's no way a third column would fit
[23:32:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Literally take an image editor, select one of the existing columns, copy/paste, and try to position the copy to the right. You'll see
[23:33:14] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: firefox manages to get a third in a lot of the cases. I'm not entirely sure why it renders substantially differently - smaller base font size? it's also at '100%' so it's a browser difference: https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16295725702612838.png

[23:35:11] <gwern> I don't think the ff version looks any worse, better in fact because of more third-columns, so it *can* be done to a greater extent than it is now in chromium
[23:35:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, by reducing the font size... :p
[23:35:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Are you quit sure you're at 100%?
[23:35:41] <gwern> well, maybe the index *should* have a smaller font size? you're skimming it, after all, not reading it
[23:35:57] <gwern> alternately, perhaps third columns should be abandoned and two-column made the max?
[23:36:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Never mind that, this whole exercise is confounded by you having different font sizes set in your browsers!
[23:36:19] <gwern> (if third columns can't be done consistently or well, better to not do them at all, perhaps)

[23:37:23] <gwern> I think it looks pretty bad to ping-pong between two and three
[23:38:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess /index does look kind of half-assed layout-wise.
[23:38:37] <gwern> it looks super half assed. it's columns laid out side by side. "you had one job" etc
[23:40:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alright. I'll look into it

[23:41:38] <gwern> (a compromise might be forcing the highlight-trio into three-column, downscaling however necessary, and then mandating the rest be double)
[23:44:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Eugh
[23:44:56] <gwern> I like having the trio side by side, but...
[23:46:10] <rmmh> Old Soviet systems mostly4 used an encoding named KOI8-R. KOI stands for “Код Обмена Информацией” (Information Interchange Code), 8 means 8-bit, and R means Russian (there’s also a Ukrainian version named KOI8-U, the Ukrainian alphabet is distinct from Russian). That encoding is, to put it politely, mildly insane: it was designed so that stripping the 8th bit from it
[23:46:12] <rmmh> leaves you with a somewhat readable ASCII transliteration of the Russian alphabet, so Russian letters don’t come in their usual order.
[23:46:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... ehehe
[23:46:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> I remember KOI8-R
[23:46:47] <rmmh> and yet the casing is backwards

[23:46:51] <Robomot> KOI8-R - Wikipedia (KOI8-R (RFC 1489) is an 8-bit character encoding, derived from the KOI-8 encoding by the programmer Andrei Chernov in 1993 and designed to cover Russian, which uses a Cyrillic alphabet. KOI8-R was based on Russian Morse code, which was created from a phonetic version of Latin Morse code. …)
