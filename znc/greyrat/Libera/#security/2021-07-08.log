[06:22:38] <GeekNerd> I see PrintNightmare's patch was incomplete if you have the point and print policy set to no warning and no elevation under computer configuration.  No article anywhere mentions the user configuration.  My org has point and print (no warning or elevation) in the user configuration, which installs user-mode drivers in the context of the users who the printers are deployed to.  Is the reason nobody's talking about user point and print configuration because
[06:23:26] <flyback> yeah if you can disable spooler for now

[06:23:45] * flyback drags Leonarbro against the exploit
[06:24:49] <GeekNerd> it's User Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Printers.  The registry key it controls is in HKEY_CURRENT_USER.  All the reports of spooler being vulnerable post patch mention privilege escalation if HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Windows NT\Printers
[06:25:01] <GeekNerd> has the nowarningnoelevation key set to 1

[06:26:42] <GeekNerd> but none mention the HLEY_CURRENT_USER equivalent (or the User Configuration under group policy that causes it).  Is this because it's just priv escalation and escalating from user mode to user mode is pointless (wheras Computer-level Point-and-print installs drivers as system)?  But what happened to the "remote code execution" aspect of it?

[06:28:14] <GeekNerd> disabling spooler would not go over well.  Except on the DC's of course

[06:29:38] <flyback> ugh
[06:29:50] <flyback> it's a shame it's a pain to load 3rd party drivers in win 64 bit
[06:30:09] <flyback> I mean it's good for security but I need the old "virtual floppy driver" so I can write out a disk
[06:30:10] <flyback> ugh
[06:30:41] *** Quits: home (~home@user/home) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[06:30:48] <GeekNerd> The workaroud is patch, and then make sure those keys in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Policies (which come from Computer Configuration point and print group policy options) are not set to bypass warnings and elevation
[06:30:58] <GeekNerd> We're in compliance with that
[06:32:07] <GeekNerd> BUT... the instructions make no mention of the equivalent point and print USER configuration group policies or their resulting registry keys in hkey_current_USER
[06:32:41] <GeekNerd> so I'm wondering if these are also vulnerable
[06:32:52] <flyback> yeah I dunno sorry

[12:06:58] <mats1> are you using volatility on the same box to analyze, or passing the dump somewhere?
[12:07:07] <mats1> like a kali vm
[12:07:08] <greg84> no

[12:10:48] <mats1> are you using --profile=Win10x64_19041 ? what exactly are you doing? you shouldnt need to since its kinda old, but did you do a git pull from the latest master branch?
[12:12:25] <greg84> i didn't use profile= as imageinfo and kdbgscan didn't work.
[12:13:19] <greg84> you think if I use the correct profile it would automatically work ?
[12:13:34] <greg84> I used the newest Volatility
[12:14:42] <mats1> try it.
[12:15:16] <greg84> ok
[12:15:59] <greg84> I have an image of the System and a vm, I could get the correct version from there.
[12:16:40] <greg84> thanks
[12:17:25] <mats1> thanks as in you got it to go? data structures can change across builds, you have to specify the profile, volatility afaik is not smart enough to get you there on its own

[21:09:24] <NthDegree> soulisson, Desktop, Documents, Pictures etc. are examples
[21:09:49] <NthDegree> and it depends on the nature of the malware
[21:10:23] <NthDegree> if I was a malware writer doing ransomware I might want to check to see if the folders are being backed up to say OneDrive
[21:10:52] <NthDegree> that way my hypothetical payload only does anything if someone can actually be ransomwared successfully
[21:10:56] <soulisson> NthDegree, ok, I wasn't clear. What so special about them? Why is there a special key for them in the registry?

[21:12:09] <NthDegree> The reason they're special is as an abstraction layer. So Common File Dialog can always reference them even if they're located in weird locations as well as for application developers to guarantee where they're writing to
[21:13:07] <NthDegree> As a Windows sysadmin, I might want Documents located at \\fileserver.domain.local\home$\john.smith\Documents

[21:20:19] <NthDegree> the one you get in Notepad is a good example
[21:20:43] <NthDegree> while Microsoft Office... well.. it cheats by importing a private copy of it, so it always differs slightly from the real Common File Dialog but acts similarly
[21:21:10] <NthDegree> (try using Office 2000 on Windows 10 for an idea of what I mean)
[21:21:20] <soulisson> NthDegree, so these are basically the things under Libraries?
[21:21:58] <NthDegree> soulisson, they happen to be referenced under Libraries but a good clue is when you use the Properties dialog it has a Location tab

[22:09:18] <ajak> beanbag-: so apply that criticism to both sides
[22:09:23] <cvmn> i heard someone say: the israeli-palestenian situation is no longer a matter of mere history ``who started 1st'', but has became a matter of present fact that is like nothing but ``an adult brutally beating a 4 years old kid for pushing him'' (due to the vast uncomprable technological gap between israel and the locked-down palestine).
[22:10:06] <beanbag-> I could even understand if the rockets were fired at the military or infrastructure to make people miserable to make a point
[22:10:16] <beanbag-> but no it's just random people in their houses getting blown up
[22:10:32] <electr0n> this isn't the place for this.
[22:10:37] <beanbag-> yeah good point
[22:10:39] <beanbag-> moving on
[22:11:02] <cvmn> palestenian rockers are firecrackers that were shot after weaks of the israeli police beating palestenian worshippers in their month of worship Ramadan, alongside shots, flash bangs and detention.
[22:11:09] <electr0n> thank you. it can just lead to a mess is all.
[22:12:18] <beanbag-> so this printer situation
[22:12:27] <beanbag-> anything can be done besides just disable spooler
[22:12:43] <ajak> update your machines?
[22:12:57] <electr0n> its ugly. I have been using network printers as a point of compromise for corp networks for years.
[22:13:21] <electr0n> great place for weakly stored credentials since lots of environments require you to authenticate before using said printer.
[22:13:52] <beanbag-> ajak, the update is CANUCKED
[22:14:28] <beanbag-> apprentely it doesn't work 100%
[22:14:46] * beanbag- drags Leonarbro_ against the update
[22:14:50] <skill> they just released a new update, haven't checked it out
[22:14:55] <beanbag-> oh cool

[22:16:46] <beanbag-> <electr0n> its ugly. I have been using network printers as a point of compromise for corp networks for years.
[22:16:47] <beanbag-> sad

[22:42:06] <beanbag-> I love emulators and virtualization
[22:46:31] <NthDegree> beanbag-, that's by design methinks
[22:46:56] <beanbag-> could be
[22:47:54] <NthDegree> "While in UEFI mode, the Windows version must match the PC architecture. A 64-bit UEFI PC can only boot 64-bit versions of Windows. A 32-bit PC can only boot 32-bit versions of Windows. In some cases, while in legacy BIOS mode, you may be able to run 32-bit Windows on a 64-bit PC, assuming the manufacturer supports 32-bit legacy BIOS mode on the PC.
[22:47:54] <NthDegree> "
[22:48:06] <NthDegree> From: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-8.1-and-8/hh824898(v=win.10)
[22:48:23] *** Joins: CraftByte (anze@user/craftbyte)
[22:48:53] <NthDegree> So basically, 32-bit Windows totally supports UEFI if it's a UEFI built for 32-bit but not 64-bit
[22:49:46] <NthDegree> and the irony is that they killed support for some earlier Intel Atom CPUs which took advantage of that "feature"

[22:51:29] <beanbag-> intel dumped compatible mode in their latest hw
[22:51:41] <NthDegree> you *might* be able to do a hackjob on it by using a 64-bit EFI file if the PC supports 64-bit EFI loading
[22:51:58] <beanbag-> it's fine I just changed the vm so it worked
[22:52:16] <beanbag-> im building a 32 bit version of win10 for virtual floppy emulator
[22:52:38] <beanbag-> they updated it to work on 64 bit but it looks like a nasty hack so I don't want to load it on my good win10 laptop
[22:53:01] <beanbag-> it emulates a floppy so when you download a older dell firmware etc updated that insist on writing to a floppy
[22:53:04] <beanbag-> it writes to this instead
[22:53:13] <beanbag-> then i can extract the files and put them on a bootable dos usb

[22:53:49] <beanbag-> yes I know vmware and vbox have an actual virtual floppy also
[22:54:04] <beanbag-> my desktop at work has to run hyper-v cause of wsl2 and so I can't run either
[22:54:15] <NthDegree> you can run virtualbox alongside hyper-v now
[22:54:31] <beanbag-> yeah but it uses the hyper-v hypervisor so what's the point
[22:54:41] <NthDegree> gives you the floppy disk emulation? =]
[22:54:45] <beanbag-> wait
[22:54:55] <beanbag-> how can you do hw emulation if you aren't the hypervisor
[22:54:57] <NthDegree> it isn't the hypervisor that provides devices, it's the virtual machine monitor
