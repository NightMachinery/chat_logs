[02:57:42] <pjs> b0nn: https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/ is what we use
[02:57:58] <pjs> well, one of our clients uses. It's probably the worst interface ever created but there you go
[02:58:45] <pjs> if your app is running on kubernetes, you can also use kubectl to view app specific logs
[02:59:57] <b0nn> pjs: thanks, yeah I'vew been over that dashboard a few times, and not got anywhere
[03:00:59] <b0nn> It only has logs for the cloudSQL - not a single mention of appEngine
[03:02:53] <nucleargrave> hey one more time and im sorry to repeat myself, but I'm looking to build an application that talks to cockroachdb and I'm in favor of using an ORM. I know this is very opinionated, but what are the best and most supported ORM's for go? I've been a huge fan of prisma lately but I saw that the go client is no longer maintained which is why I'm here and ideally i'd like something similar. Thanks in
[03:02:55] <nucleargrave> advance for any thoughts / opinions. If this isn't the best place to ask, I'd also appreciate pointers to any place else.
[03:06:02] <seebs> historically i haven't seen a lot of ORMs in use, and i'm not sure why, but i think it's the same reason there's few Web Frameworks actually being used

[06:36:43] <fizzie> Maybe not a *likely* cause, but there's definitely *some* differences in the destination address sorting. The native Go resolver I believe always follows the RFC 6724 policy table; system ones might instead have RFC 3484 defaults (which e.g. used to prefer 2001::/32 aka Teredo and 2002::/16 aka 6to4 over native IPv4) + may respect /etc/gai.conf customizations. And the default dialer does RFC 6555
[06:36:45] <fizzie> "fast fallback" to v4 if v6 takes too long for any reason, which I guess the resolver might affect somehow, though I don't see how.

[14:15:17] <LordDoskias> are cgo flags transitive, that is if I add some #cgo directives in my package which depends on some other package which also contains cgo would the directives defined in my package affect compilation of the external dependency ?

[14:18:55] *** Joins: tripfandango (~tripfanda@77.137.65.104)
[14:21:03] <fizzie> Yes and no. ;) CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS and CXXFLAGS are per-package, and only used to compile that specific package. LDFLAGS (and pkg-config directives) are used at link time, so all *those* values from all packages are concatenated for the program's final link step.
[14:21:25] <fizzie> See the bit of https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo that starts "All the cgo CPPFLAGS and CFLAGS directives in a package ..."
[14:30:06] *** Joins: fef (~thedawn@user/thedawn)
[14:30:14] <LordDoskias> so if i want to override this behavior id' need to pass those flags before invoking go build
[14:30:23] <LordDoskias> CFLAGS= CPPFLAGS= go build ...
[14:31:40] <fizzie> `CGO_CFLAGS=... CGO_CPPFLAGS=... go build ...`, I believe.
[14:32:31] <fizzie> (And possibly also CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW / CGO_CPPFLAGS_ALLOW if it's a more special kind of flag.)
[14:33:18] <fizzie> Well, actually maybe that latter bit doesn't apply to the environment variables.

[14:49:04] <jjakob> older system has glibc 2.23, mine has 2.32

[14:54:03] <ikke> jjakob: how are you building it statically?
[14:54:49] <jjakob> the commands are in that paste link. found them at https://github.com/golang/go/issues/26492
[14:55:06] <ikke> Are you using CGO?
[14:56:28] <jjakob> my code does not, I don't know if any module dependency does
[14:56:37] *** Quits: nuclearg1 (~nucleargr@user/nuclearg1) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[14:57:02] <ikke> You can try to build with CGO_ENABLED=0
[14:57:16] <ikke> but that does mean things like DNS might behave differently
[14:58:03] <ikke> My understanding is that glibc cannot be easily statically compiled (musl would work)

[14:59:07] <jjakob> CGO_ENABLED=0 throws the same errors as the 2nd case in the paste
[14:59:35] <jjakob> AFAIK it defaults to 0 unless enabled
[15:00:25] <ikke> It links to libc be default, which needs CGO
[15:02:01] <jjakob> yeah, reading about that, system packages like net use cgo
[15:02:47] <jjakob> what do I need to do to build with musl on gentoo?
[15:03:58] <jjakob> https://honnef.co/posts/2015/06/statically_compiled_go_programs__always__even_with_cgo__using_musl/
[15:04:24] <jjakob> so maybe it's as simple as installing musl and setting CC to musl-gcc

[15:10:42] <andlabs> I think the PIE and external linkmode is pulling in cgo maybe?
[15:11:01] <andlabs> is just doing CGO_ENABLED=0 go build without any extra build options sufficient?
[15:11:38] <jjakob> umm maybe it seems like it is

[15:13:14] *** Joins: alwyn (~alwyn@user/alwyn)
[15:13:47] <jjakob> having just CGO_ENABLED=0 does indeed produce a static executable
[15:14:08] <jjakob> thanks andlabs
[15:14:50] <andlabs> yeah
[15:14:59] <andlabs> that issue is missing the important context of "for cgo only"
[15:15:17] <andlabs> go binaries that don't use cgo should already be fully static, unless we're abandoning *that* original goal/selling point too...

[19:05:02] <lidless> Any Go/GUI developers here? Curious what their preferred library is. Go seems to have a lot of unmaintained GUI projects. I'm hoping to avoid things like Electron since it's so low, but if that's how the industry is heading then I'll have to embrace it
[19:05:20] <bpalmer> "so low" ?
[19:06:30] <R2robot> low class? :)

[19:16:12] <lidless> haha! slip. "slow"
[19:16:25] <lidless> As in.. it's the newer Java of GUI frameworks
[19:16:28] <bpalmer> web apps are much like electron but work with people's actual browsers (at least the mainstream ones); on the other hand, you have to be familiar with an do some amount of work in javascript
[19:16:54] <lidless> I'm familiar enough with web-dev stuff. I'm looking for something that is cross platform and speedy
[19:17:05] <lidless> Also, so I can learn Go in a practical way with something I'll use
[19:18:08] <zsnes> is it just me or does test code often exceed the length of the code being tested?

[19:18:58] <lidless> If you want full coverage, probably not far from the truth
[19:19:30] <bpalmer> lidless: well, I haven't used any of the GUI toolkits, so perhaps others can advise you. I nowadays write almost everything to run over the web.
[19:19:47] <bpalmer> (Not technically a "web app" in the sense of having a service worker, etc)
[19:19:54] <lidless> Right

[19:20:37] <lidless> but... it would definitely need workers for my purposes. For example, importing binary formats like from HP Fortify
[19:20:55] <lidless> I'm looking to make a FOSS competitor to ThreadFix
[19:21:17] <lidless> but I'm also keen on learning GUI desktop stuff, and Go seems like such a fun language to work with
[19:22:03] <lidless> I also want to make a GUI front-end to `pass` that is just as good as 1Password, and I feel like compiled is the way to go
[19:23:45] * antarus was never sure how native toolkits in golang, statically compiled, worked well with the dynamically linked desktop.

If you’d like to take over one of these channels, then you’ll need to be associated in some way with the project in question." && "Primary channels are reserved based on a formal or informal claim, external to IRC, to a specific project group, or trademarked name."

[23:25:55] <b0nn> uhhh
[23:26:04] <b0nn> the rule I was looking for was namespaces
[23:26:17] <b0nn> like #python and #python-offtopic
[23:30:41] <fizzie> That part was: "A registered group (as outlined on the page about group registration) can claim ownership over primary channels bearing the group's names or name prefixes. For example, freenode itself owns the channel ‘#freenode’ and all channels beginning with ‘#freenode-’."
[23:31:24] <fizzie> I don't think any particular policy will explain why it's #go-* rather than #golang-* though.
[23:31:40] <fizzie> The Go project has lately been focusing on putting things under go.dev rather than golang.org, you could just say the IRC channel was ahead of its time.

[23:38:17] <seebs> the reason it's go-nuts rather than golang-nuts is that the language name is go, and is not golang

[23:53:36] <fizzie> If you're planning to do that, I think it might maybe make more sense to use `go run` with no version suffix, and use the module dependencies to manage the version. Depending. But there's a bit of a convention around that.
[23:54:06] <chilversc> I don't want to have the version change by supprise as that could generate invalid code for the version of the package I'm using
[23:54:13] *** Quits: bluedust (~bluedust@103.161.144.107) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:54:39] <fizzie> Well, that's the point, the "version of the package you're using" is already controlled by the module's go.mod dependencies.
[23:55:05] <chilversc> would that still be honoured even with "go run ..."?
[23:55:21] <fizzie> Yes, if it's being run within a module and specifies no version. IIRC.
[23:55:54] <fizzie> go help run: "If the package argument doesn't have a version suffix, "go run" may run in module-aware mode or GOPATH mode -- If module-aware mode is enabled, "go run" runs in the context of the main module."

[23:56:16] <fizzie> Running "in the context of the main module" means using the go.mod for version selection as usual.
[23:57:07] *** Quits: christophergray (~christoph@186.151.17.62) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[23:58:26] <chilversc> and then throw in a dummy tools file with //go:build tools so that go mod tidy doesn't remove the dependency?
[23:58:29] <fizzie> Also if you use `go run` with an explicit version suffix, you get that exact version; but when you're actually building the package, MVS may select a different (higher) version if one of your transitive dependencies wants it. So just manually ensuring the go.mod and the go:generate lines match doesn't necessarily mean you get the same version.
[23:58:34] <fizzie> Yeah.

[23:59:07] <chilversc> thanks, that seems to solve the annoyance with having to install a specific version of the tool to get go generate to work
[23:59:23] <chilversc> though I was curious where go tools come from, and how you add tools to that list?
