[01:27:55] <Khepra> Azrael_-: unbound is a recursive caching resolver. which means that, unless configured differently, it will query the "root" dns servers and recurse from them to final authoritative NS zone for the request.
[01:28:14] <Azrael_-> and how/where are the root dns servers configured?
[01:28:37] <Khepra> the "root" servers are hardcoded in every recursive resolver because they have to be, otherwise you have chicken or the egg problem

[01:29:45] <Azrael_-> ok, thanks for this explanation. another strange part: even though there seems to be nearly no configuration, unbound is only listening on localhost. is this normal or is this configured somewhere i don't know yet?
[01:29:57] <PerfDave> That's probably a sensible default

[01:31:37] <Khepra> you haven't shown there to be a bug
[01:31:50] <daft> Sub.sub.host.name resolving gives the ip address of sub.host.name
[01:31:53] <Khepra> use dig(8) and it's +trace option to find out where the response is coming from
[01:31:57] <Khepra> *its
[01:32:36] <greycat> daft: name lookups are done by libc6 and by libnss* modules.  You haven't ever told us the NAME.  Nobody can try to reproduce your results or probe your DNS configs without that.
[01:32:36] <Khepra> daft: and you have eliminated the possiblity that the authoritative server, or your configured resolvers, or etc/hosts, is giving out that answer?
[01:33:31] <Azrael_-> before trying to report a bug for this, directly query the nameserver hosting this domain for the data and see if it is "right" there
[01:33:39] <daft> It works on my phone using my local dns server. It did work on ubuntu 20.10 it does not work on any debian vm i have

[01:47:56] <greycat> neither of those things should be necessary in this case, but maybe they've got a different error than the one they showed...
[01:48:37] <greycat> a new shell (or just hash -r) would be helpful if they had an old cached value, e.g. they used to have $HOME/bin/dig but it went away
[01:48:51] <greycat> but in that case, you'd see the old path in the error message
[01:49:36] <Khepra> greycat: I think they're talking about the "command-not-found" package, the program that tells you which package to install when you get a command not found
[01:49:47] <greycat> I'm talking about bash in the absence of that thing.
[01:49:56] <greycat> someone else suggested it

This is a server in a datacenter and I'm worried if I reboot it it won't come back up.  Is there a way to force-restart a systemd service?

[17:27:49] <wr> *install
[17:28:10] <amacater_> apt-get remove libreoffice should do it
[17:28:29] <wr> amacater_, should i use --purge?
[17:28:31] <wr> also
[17:28:43] <wr> apt-get remove --purge libreofice
[17:28:54] <amacater_> You can. I use apt-get - so where I say apt-get, apt will also work.
[17:29:03] <wr> yes
[17:29:41] <amacater_> if you apt remove libreoffice, it will remove the meta-package anyway and may then tell you that anything not yet removed can be removed with apt autoremove
[17:30:16] <amacater_> apt-remove --purge libreoffice ; apt autoremove && apt install libreoffice
[17:30:25] <wr> amacater_, Package 'libreoffice' is not installed, so not removed, does package have another name?
[17:31:32] <wr> amacater_, Haohmaru am starting to think if i installed libreoffice, i guess have to use libreoffice*
[17:31:32] <Haohmaru> ,i libreoffice
[17:31:34] <judd> Package libreoffice (metapackages, optional) in bullseye/amd64: office productivity suite (metapackage). Version: 1:7.0.4-4+deb11u1; Size: 201.1k; Installed: 219k; Homepage: http://www.libreoffice.org; Screenshot: https://screenshots.debian.net/package/libreoffice
[17:32:09] <wr> amacater_, i can reinstall, i don't need to remove it?, right?
[17:33:02] <amacater_> so - it looks as if the individual apps can be installed relatively independently. Installing the meta-package libreoffice would install me a couple of hundred MB extra
[17:33:23] <amacater_> So libreoffice-calc is installed for example.

[17:34:19] <Haohmaru> so try apt remove libreoffice-* and read carefully what it's gonna do
[17:34:56] <amacater_> You can also force apt to do a dry run, I think.
[17:36:34] <wr> Haohmaru, on libreoffice part no problem, thing is if it messes dependencies, so was good i remembered reinstall
