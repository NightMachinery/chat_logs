[17:31:53] <josevalim> thanks! i have pushed an improvement to the docs in this case but note "I am seeing a lot of Elixir snippets that don't provide context" doesn't help much unless we know said contexts :)
[17:32:02] <josevalim> dcz: ^
[17:32:27] <dcz> josevalim: I'll report next time I'm losing track!
[17:34:08] <dcz> okay, another Eureka of mine from today is that "config.exs" is compile-time. I'm not sure where in the documentation that could be fixed, because I used a) random blog posts, and b) documentation for modules like Ecto and Bamboo
[17:35:19] <dcz> maybe {:system, "VAR_NAME"} references could have a note why it's even necessary, because that got me on the right path
[17:37:18] <josevalim> the {:system, ...} stuff is all outdated stuff that should not be used anymore

[21:16:35] <whk> is there perhaps a list of elixir keywords/tokens. i see "bc" and "lc" has been added as keywords to web-mode (emacs) for elixir, but not sure why.

[22:03:05] <whk> uhm. will check. point is that if there is a new PR trying to cater for this in web-mode with extra complexity i doubt it is worth the merge. 
[22:05:03] <benwilson512> phaleth: I swear in one of the posts about it they were saying that it would leave an unblanced </form> tag which isn't allowed in heex
[22:05:06] <benwilson512> instead you have this https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.Helpers.html#form/1
[22:05:51] <whk> yes, it does not work in heex, because it actually parses the tags it seems. 
[22:06:26] <benwilson512> which is great, missing closing tags causes huge issues w/ live view because morphdom can't diff correctly
[22:07:13] <whk> it was pretty annoying yeah, super happy it changed. 
[22:08:28] <benwilson512> balancing the tags should finally allow things like beautify to work correctly too
[22:10:47] <phaleth> benwilson512: yeah, you are right, but if the </form> tag is removed then the heex template will compile and the closing form tag will be rendered before the closing parent tag of the form
[22:11:43] <whk> now to see how to make <. tags work, but thinking it should not be too hard.
