[01:01:09] <Cl0udNinja> @generaal eric I'd suggest getting the vpn up then, and then working the esxi host problem, vcenter is just management, the hosts are doin the heavy lifting so you can operate without vcenter for a bit
[01:01:49] <Cl0udNinja> shakygator, yeah, just a painful goddamn process atm, because every change I have to rebuild the container, and dockers been funky and not rebuilding parts of the container when I change certain things
[01:02:18] <shakygator> is it skipping some layers when running the build
[01:02:25] <shakygator> cuz maybe you changed an external resource
[01:02:38] <shakygator> so docker thinks the layers already exist

[01:02:53] <shakygator> you can add an ENV command before it
[01:02:55] <shakygator> and then change it
[01:03:05] <shakygator> like put a version number in ENV
[01:03:08] <shakygator> before the COPY cmd

[02:10:02] <monr0e> Gah you;re right. I was thinking of something else. I swear I remember some way to forcefully overwrite a bucket with a file made up of 0's, delete that single file, and kill the bucket
[02:10:06] <xe0n> more like fuck you for not reading documentation
[02:10:12] <monr0e> but its been a loooog time since I fucked around with aws

[02:11:15] <Cl0udNinja> monr0e, yeah that wouldnt change anything, still having to delete the file individually in the end. its because buckets arent actually filesystems

[03:44:01] <shibboleth> there's a whole lot more punch in the space occupied by an intel NUC than what you'll get out of all the raspis you can fit in the same space?
[03:44:22] <arlion> you're right, but i also don't want to spend 1k in 4 machines
[03:44:23] <Hunterkll> i should order a shitload of pi4's and scalp them on ebay 
[03:44:24] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:44:36] <arlion> or authorized reseller on amazon
[03:44:46] <shibboleth> yeah, my local brick-and-mortar has 8+ rpi4 in stock
[03:44:48] <shibboleth> never been out

[03:44:58] <Hunterkll> RPI4 prices on ebay
[03:44:59] <Hunterkll> are insane
[03:44:59] <Alternity> what local store has rpi's
[03:44:59] <arlion> undercut the motherducker who is selling them at 225
[03:45:08] <Alternity> you see what i mean about prices
[03:45:08] <Hunterkll> im ordering 10 just to start

[03:45:16] <Azem> Alternity: I do assembler for ARM and also I am fucking around with robotics so I use them for running code on there that I write
[03:45:27] <Hunterkll> e1: that's still like $75/unit profit

[03:46:09] <Alternity> i ended up buying a rpi400 at $70
[03:46:09] <e1> You could make profit on 110usd/unit
[03:46:17] <Azem> I have 5 Arduino kits on way
[03:46:21] <e1> on ebay with free shipping lol
[03:46:22] <arlion> and you know they will go quick if you list em at 150
[03:46:34] <Alternity> its actually not bad when you consider its a 4gb rpi4 with a massive heatsink
[03:46:41] <Alternity> hits 2.2ghz without issue fanless
[03:47:17] <shibboleth> even a pentium d 2.2ghz from 2006 will beat the shit out of it
[03:47:27] <Hunterkll> now that's just not true
[03:47:28] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:47:40] <arlion> geesh, sell em at 175 and with 10 you will walk away with 1k in your pocket, seller pays shipping
[03:48:00] <arlion> *buyer pays shipping
[03:49:04] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:49:05] <Alternity> arlion pays shipping
[03:49:16] <shibboleth> Hunterkll, depends on what you have it doing. but yeah, the rpi4 doesn't require a fan, so yay progress :)
[03:49:34] <Hunterkll> shibboleth: clock for clock the rpi4's cores are far more performant than said pentium D
[03:49:38] <Alternity> raw compute is not the primary factor in many scenerios anyway
[03:50:03] <Alternity> rpi4 is 'fast enough' in a way the rpi3 was not, whcih makes it actually useful for more things
[03:50:40] <shibboleth> true, the pi4 was a huge step up compared to pi2/3

[03:51:02] <shibboleth> other than dongle required for hdmi though
[03:51:08] <arlion> the ram itself, 8gb model, is very attractive to home labbers
[03:51:20] <shibboleth> damn you. i'd get microhdmi for the second output though
[03:51:50] <technonerd_> you can boot from usb
[03:52:00] <Alternity> arlion you setup a homelab with k8s already?
[03:52:15] <arlion> meh, just install it with openssh enabled. I've never hooked up to my raspis before
[03:52:18] <Alternity> i boot mine from either usb or usb to ssd

[03:52:54] <arlion> Alternity: i did once, then i sold the whole cluster to a cowoker like 3 years ago when i needed the cash. now im studying for the CKA and want another cluster.
[03:52:57] <Hunterkll> alright
[03:52:58] <Alternity> arlion here is a good starting place https://github.com/k8s-at-home/template-cluster-k3s
[03:53:09] <Hunterkll> $784.90 to be billed NET30 when shipped
[03:53:12] <Alternity> as in, a really, really good starting place tbh
[03:53:12] <Hunterkll> expected sometime next month
[03:53:15] <Hunterkll> 10 RPI4 8GB 
[03:53:18] <Alternity> will teach you a lot if you're still figuring k8s out
[03:53:29] <Hunterkll> $831.99 with tax
[03:53:41] <arlion> i have 3 pis sitting around, one 3, 2 4s with 4 gb of ram, might just set up a two node cluster in the mean time 
[03:54:01] <Alternity> k3s you can do a single master, its fine for dev
[03:54:31] <arlion> since i maintain the cloud at work, i have my own k8s cluster at work but it requires using my work computer and when i am done with work i really don't want to turn it on.

[04:12:55] <sloth_on_meth> Can i just shuck a seagate external?
[04:13:05] <Alternity> about to say prob
[04:13:16] <Alternity> wait for a sale on the easystores is the usual route
[04:13:32] <DSee> Slack or Discord?
[04:13:39] <Alternity> iirc the whites in externals are almost as good as reds
[04:13:56] <sloth_on_meth> Yeah most of my drives are shucked hehe
[04:14:04] <sloth_on_meth> I'm just running out of space and sata ports oof
[04:14:29] <Alternity> external should be just as fast these days i'd think
[04:14:32] <sloth_on_meth> Quick note: can Ubuntu linux support, let's say, a 20TB drive? I know windows has issues with Large drives
[04:14:45] <Alternity> usb3.0 is already way faster than spinning rust can go
[04:14:50] <sloth_on_meth> Yeah true
[04:15:10] <Alternity> dont think so little of ubuntu
[04:15:15] <sloth_on_meth> Hahaha
[04:16:03] <sloth_on_meth> I'm on 18TB now with a random mix of drives
[04:16:16] <Hunterkll> lord have mercy 
[04:16:16] <Alternity> actually it looks like ext4 only goes to 16tb partitions
[04:16:29] <sloth_on_meth> Ahhaha
[04:16:30] <Alternity> so you prob will want to use xfs
[04:16:38] <Hunterkll> that shit was the diameter of my wrist
[04:16:40] <Hunterkll> fucking hell
[04:16:41] <Alternity> which goes to 8 exbibytes
[04:16:55] <sloth_on_meth> Hunterkill lmao
[04:16:57] <Hunterkll> sloth_on_meth: windows hasn't had issues with large drives in like 20 years
[04:16:59] <sloth_on_meth> Only 8? Pff
[04:17:13] <sloth_on_meth> Hunterkll haha okay, just something i heard once.
[04:17:22] <Hunterkll> Alternity: ext4 can go up to 1 exabyte partition, with 16tb maximum file sizes
[04:17:38] <sloth_on_meth> Only 1 exa? Pff
[04:17:40] <sloth_on_meth> :')
[04:17:48] <Hunterkll> sloth_on_meth: only large drive issue i've ever encountered is MBR-style partitoned systems and/or bios-bootable based volumes
[04:17:54] <sloth_on_meth> Right, thanks
[04:17:58] <Hunterkll> which caps you at 2TB for the boot volume
[04:18:09] <Hunterkll> but even on 2000 i've had 6TB+ volumes on servers
[04:18:10] <catbeard> work has >2PB of HTTP/3 traffic per month whooooey
[04:18:13] <Hunterkll> just non-boot volume
[04:18:23] <sloth_on_meth> Jesus fuck catbeard

[04:18:54] <sloth_on_meth> How much money do the 8TB easystores cost on sale?
[04:18:55] <Hunterkll> ext4's always had the 1EB limitation 
[04:19:00] <sloth_on_meth> Like, ballpark?
[04:19:07] <Hunterkll> fuck if i know
[04:19:07] <Alternity> about tree fiddy

[04:24:10] <e1> let me check
[04:24:11] <e1> !friday
[04:25:21] <Hunterkll> sloth_on_meth: note also that EXT4's limitations i mentioned above are block-size reliant
[04:25:34] <Hunterkll> so if you use larger than 4K block sizes, the 16TB max file and 1EB max vol sizes go up proportionally as well

[09:14:32] <MOLNIJA> mine does too, but I don't plan to break 384GB

[09:16:58] <MOLNIJA> :?
[09:17:02] <Hunterkll> about $8k in ram
[09:17:03] <Hunterkll> not bad
[09:17:05] <jay-ros> e1 your diet kinda assumes that though :D
[09:17:08] <Hunterkll> less than what i'll be spending on drives
[09:17:26] <Hunterkll> and pretty future proof too, given that everything is DDR4 right now
[09:17:39] <MOLNIJA> I just want to reach 384 for a joke
[09:17:49] <jay-ros> yeah here in australia we're fucked for ddr4 at the moment hunter

[09:18:18] <jay-ros> but there's just not enough hardware projects because of shipping issues
[09:18:20] <Hunterkll> i'm seeing $600-800 pricing average per 128GB stick

[09:19:00] <MOLNIJA> oh no
[09:19:13] <jay-ros> missed it by 5 minutes, heartbroken
[09:19:25] <jay-ros> next lowest price here is around 130

[09:21:29] <jay-ros> yeah imagine all the cisco ucs m4 servers reaching 5 years
[09:21:40] <jay-ros> really? that's shit. You on provisioning with them?
[09:21:50] <sd> 02<M‚Äãitchy93> Laptops
[09:21:53] <jay-ros> ah righto
[09:21:55] <Hunterkll> huh
[09:21:59] <Hunterkll> dell jumps when we bark
[09:22:00] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:22:08] <jay-ros> yeah we're getting our stuff from malaysia built
[09:22:16] <Hunterkll> but we're also only ordering mainstream latitudes and precision units
[09:22:26] <jay-ros> so if there's shipping issues (there is) there's hardware delivery time issues (there definitely is)
[09:22:34] <jay-ros> 2021: year of the lack of docking stations
[09:22:46] <Hunterkll> dell seems to send us thunderbolt docks whenever we ask :P
[09:22:56] <jay-ros> yeah you're ordering for the big scary bois though
[09:23:06] <Hunterkll> I categorically refuse to touch USB docks
[09:23:10] <jay-ros> we were getting them put aside when the next shipment came, but they were super hard to come by
[09:23:34] <jay-ros> I wasn't given one in my new job (dock) - just the laptop
[09:23:43] <yuken> based.
[09:24:21] <jay-ros> I use a desktop with tri-screen anyway, it does the job
[09:24:22] <Hunterkll> microsoft has plenty of inventory of the surface docks :P
[09:25:25] <jay-ros> I don't mind the surface docks, they're pretty neat
[09:25:42] <jay-ros> are they still the magnetic connectors to the surface?
[09:25:46] <Hunterkll> yes
[09:25:54] <jay-ros> yeah they're pretty well-made
[09:26:26] <MOLNIJA> let's not be horny about hardware cost problems
[09:26:30] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:26:32] <jay-ros> I've got a couple of what look to be thunderbolts on my elitebook, but they're on the right hand side
[09:26:38] <Hunterkll> forgot to configure my local java installation to allow TLS 1.0
[09:27:26] <xe0n> the surface dock 1 sucked.
[09:27:36] <Hunterkll> that was the only one i really liked tho ugh
[09:27:38] <Hunterkll> formfactor wise
[09:27:39] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:28:50] <MOLNIJA> why did HP demerge twice?
[09:29:01] <Hunterkll> huh?
[09:29:04] <jay-ros> that's the cube one with the two mini displayports and the two usb adapters?
[09:29:16] <Hunterkll> they did it once, then HPe merged with my former employer CSC to create DXC 
[09:29:24] <Hunterkll> that was an upward merge (in size)
[09:29:26] <csws> wait what
[09:29:31] <csws> DXC is HPE?
[09:29:32] <MOLNIJA> first, Hewlett Packard and.. was it Aligent? within 4 years of 2000
[09:29:38] <Hunterkll> csws: HPE + CSC 
[09:29:42] <csws> horrifying
[09:29:43] <MOLNIJA> then HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise
[09:29:46] <Hunterkll> MOLNIJA: well, that was a long time ago 
[09:29:54] <Hunterkll> they spun off their scientific/lab instruments divison 
[09:29:57] <Hunterkll> because it made sense to 
[09:29:57] <MOLNIJA> ye
[09:30:01] *** Quits: riff-IRC (~riff-IRC@user/riff-irc) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:30:02] <Hunterkll> wasn't their primary market anymore
[09:30:10] <csws> it all makes sense now
[09:30:20] <csws> I had the "pleasure" of dealing with DXC on a daily basis at my last job
[09:30:57] <Hunterkll> csws: yea, CSC's only contribution was to make HPe shittier, i bet
[09:31:16] *** Joins: riff-IRC (~riff-IRC@user/riff-irc)
[09:31:19] <Hunterkll> tbh when we got spun out of CSC we all thought they were getting rid of the federal divisions to sell out to an indian outsourcing company or something
[09:31:19] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:31:29] <MOLNIJA> oh god
[09:31:34] <e1> 2k tickets, god i done goofed
[09:31:37] <jay-ros> that was perspex or some similar name wasn't it?
[09:31:38] <MOLNIJA> HPE demerged HPEES?
[09:31:40] <jay-ros> perplexia
[09:31:41] <csws> wtf e1
[09:31:43] <Hunterkll> then the HPe shit came out, and we had  2-year noncompete (CSC couldn't do federal sector stuff at all) 
[09:31:54] <Hunterkll> and HPe does federal shit
[09:32:12] <Hunterkll> so they just forgave all our debt instead to dissolve the noncompete, which put us in an insanely good footing
[09:32:13] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:32:16] <MOLNIJA> Why do you lowercase the E in HPE?
[09:32:21] <Hunterkll> debt free with all that sweet federal revenue 
[09:32:32] <Hunterkll> MOLNIJA: because that's the nomenclature for how it's normally spelled/written?
[09:32:35] <MOLNIJA> ah
[09:32:41] <MOLNIJA> I have always seen it in all-caps
[09:32:45] <csws> no it isn't
[09:32:46] <csws> it's HPE
[09:32:57] <Hunterkll> that's how i've seen it on all the legal paperwork anyway
[09:33:01] <Hunterkll> *shrug*
[09:33:03] <MOLNIJA> hm!
[09:33:14] <Hunterkll> we still get calls from them to occasionally help/retreive data from old ass aspects of the company
[09:33:16] <csws> the title on their homepage literally says "Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)
[09:33:59] <Hunterkll> huh, it was just the services division, which makes sense, i figured they went full ham though
[09:34:00] <Hunterkll> oh well
[09:34:24] <Hunterkll> never cared enoguh, was just glad to have the CSC yoke lifted
[09:34:30] <Hunterkll> shame they carved up and sold off the /8 though 
[09:34:50] <MOLNIJA> you CSRA?
[09:35:03] <Hunterkll> CSC Government Solutions at the time :P
[09:35:06] <Hunterkll> that was a long ass time ago
[09:35:17] <MOLNIJA> I'm chasing breadcrumbs for some reason
[09:35:26] <csws> are you hungry?
[09:35:32] <jay-ros> do you like pizza?
[09:35:33] <Hunterkll> god, that was what, 2016? 
[09:35:53] <MOLNIJA> no csws, no jay-ros
[09:36:05] <MOLNIJA> I mean breadcrumbs of someone's identity
[09:36:15] <csws> trying to dox Hunterkll?
[09:36:17] <MOLNIJA> nah
[09:36:19] <jay-ros> yeah
[09:36:26] <Hunterkll> over som ething that happened 5-6 years ago  :P
[09:36:28] <Hunterkll> good luck with that
[09:36:28] <jay-ros> he does that himself
[09:36:29] <DoTheNeedful> s/does/dose
[09:36:29] <layer8> jay-ros meant: "he dose that himself"
[09:36:31] <MOLNIJA> although finding out their employer probably counts as doxing
[09:36:38] <jay-ros> you can see breadcrumbs on his keyboard
[09:36:40] <jay-ros> :P
[09:36:42] <Hunterkll> a lot changes in half a decade
[09:36:42] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:36:52] <Hunterkll> jay-ros: at least it isn't crusty and sticky at the same time like yours

[09:37:24] <MOLNIJA> ah..
[09:37:34] <Hunterkll> kept losing contracts left and right over being basically stupid and incompetent and/or just outright illegal 
[09:37:34] <jay-ros> not sure about US, but AU CSC was alright
[09:37:41] <jay-ros> if you liked mainframes
[09:37:43] <Hunterkll> lost one contract, then they *bought* the small biz that got that contract 
[09:37:43] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:37:53] <MOLNIJA> that's ridiculous
[09:37:53] <csws> jay-ros, I had to deal with a DXC netapp person
[09:37:55] <csws> they were absolutely crap

[09:38:08] <jay-ros> I ran purestorage in my last place
[09:38:12] <jay-ros> they paid for steaks
[09:38:27] <csws> the DXC onsite people were mostly ok
[09:38:29] <jay-ros> and they booked out a cinema for movie releases
[09:38:30] <csws> like desktops and helldesk
[09:38:32] *** Quits: polar (~me@user/polar) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:39:05] <MOLNIJA> wow, DXC is operating at a loss
[09:39:10] <csws> amazing
[09:39:21] <csws> TBH
[09:39:23] <Hunterkll> not surprising
[09:39:28] <csws> as shitty as some aspects of DXC were
[09:39:29] <Hunterkll> is mike lowerie still involved?
[09:39:40] <csws> I'd take their local helldesk any day of the week over the "local" TCS helldesk
[09:39:46] <Hunterkll> lawrie 
[09:39:47] <Hunterkll> mike lawrie
[09:39:54] <csws> where they hired like half a dozen indian guys, shoved them in an office in sydney then set the calls to overflow to india
[09:39:59] <MOLNIJA> meow
[09:39:59] <csws> which broke the contract.. but htey don't care
[09:40:12] <Hunterkll> ah no apparently he left in 2019 
[09:40:20] <Hunterkll> https://www.theregister.com/2019/09/12/dxc_mike_lawrie/
[09:40:32] <Hunterkll> i've run into him a few times at government events
[09:41:02] <Hunterkll> always nice when you're chatting with people at the company booth and they go "Oh hi mike!" and you nearly shit your pants and nearly drop your drink at the realization the CEO is standing right behind you
[09:41:03] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:41:09] <epony> check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PA-RISC#CPU_specifications
[09:41:15] <csws> lol I remember them reporting on a DXC townhall where the plebs were complaining about no pay rises, promotions and ever increasing outsourcing
[09:41:28] <Hunterkll> "While the plummeting value of the biz and allegations of mistreatment by underlings would be enough to put most execs in the stocks, DXC said Lawrie's retirement has nothing to do with its recent fortunes.
[09:41:28] <Hunterkll> "
[09:42:14] <epony> in 2004-2006 CPUs were 90nm at 2.5-3GHz and 2C2T on the mass market on open architectures
[09:42:44] <Hunterkll> lol what the hell
[09:42:50] <csws> open architectures?
[09:42:53] <Hunterkll> he runs his own consulting firm now
[09:42:56] <Hunterkll> for CEO consulting services
[09:42:57] <Hunterkll> hahahaha
[09:43:19] <csws> "Ruin your company's reputation in 1 year or less with our easy course!"
[09:43:26] <epony> that's why the CISC machines you call RISC are not very popular after 1996.. Pentium CPUs displaced them
[09:43:26] <Hunterkll> https://www.linkedin.com/company/tlg-llc/
[09:43:37] <jay-ros> are we talking about Dell's 'four pillar' presentations csws?
[09:43:40] <MOLNIJA> epony: you mean ERISC, right?
[09:43:53] <csws> jay-ros, not familiar with that
[09:44:15] <Hunterkll> epony: you're still wrong about ARM, cherrypicking examples doesn't help your case, and RISC machines were still wildly popular up to the late 2000s
[09:44:20] <Hunterkll> just not on the consumer side
[09:44:23] <epony> it's just an example of RISC commercial decline in "workstation" markets for high cost and lack of software
[09:44:30] <Hunterkll> PA-RISC was dying in the late 90s 
[09:44:36] <jay-ros> csws - it was a marketing thing a few years back
[09:44:39] <Hunterkll> hence the port of HP-UX to itanium 
[09:44:52] <epony> so was Alpha and MIPS and PPC
[09:44:53] <Hunterkll> regardless, wh y the fuck are you still stuck on this
[09:44:57] <xe0n> really? we're back to this...
[09:44:58] <jay-ros> 'we're going to keep moving on things we were already working on, but we're gonna try and sell it more"
[09:46:19] <epony> "RISC architectures have traditionally had few successes in the desktop PC and commodity server markets, where the x86-based platforms remain the dominant processor architecture."  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer#Comparison_to_other_architectures
[09:46:27] <Hunterkll> okay?
[09:46:34] <Hunterkll> no one ever argued against that.....
[09:47:25] <Hunterkll> doesn't make x86 superior, just means it was positioned as good enough at the right price (and a fewe other factors helping force adoptions)
[09:47:48] <Hunterkll> I do like how you didn't copy the line right after that though - However, this may change, as ARM-based processors are being developed for higher performance systems
[09:47:48] <jay-ros> I believe this exact conversation has happened previously
[09:47:55] <Hunterkll> jay-ros: yesterday, in fact
[09:48:33] <jay-ros> and it was a strawman argument from epony and everyone was responding with 'yes, reasonable comment, but not really anything all that interesting because adoption is predominantly market-driven, and it is what it is"
[09:48:48] <epony> it was positioned early, and retaind backward compatibility
[09:49:02] *** ChanServ sets mode: -o xe0n
[09:49:21] <Hunterkll> which has hurt it in many regards, intel's finally letting go of some shit though.....

[09:54:08] <epony> I don't remember what you said about ARM servers yet..
[09:54:21] <Hunterkll> that the market share has been on a rapid upward trajectory ?
[09:54:27] <jay-ros> I remember distinctly what he said about arm servers

[09:55:05] <jay-ros> wow
[09:55:10] <jay-ros> straight to the point there
[09:55:14] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:55:15] <jay-ros> no dickin' about
[09:55:58] <jay-ros> hey hunterkll, do you think that ARM devices are becoming less prevalent due to the increases in performance of x86 achitecture recently?
[09:56:05] <Hunterkll> jay-ros: lol
[09:56:18] <jay-ros> I feel like it'll be a steep decline with the next release of AMD chipsets and a drive for Intel to increase performance to compete
[09:56:27] <Hunterkll> jay-ros: i think they'll survive just fine due to fanboys like AMD did for almost two decades
[09:56:48] <epony> which one of these is the SERVER line of CPUs?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ARM_microarchitectures#ARM_core_timeline
[09:56:51] <jay-ros> and ARMs just going to be left in the rear view mirror across desktops, server infrastructure AND IoT, especially with the 'e-friendly cores"
[09:56:52] * epony laughs
[09:56:56] <jay-ros> all of them epony, all of them.
[09:56:58] <epony> muahahahahahaha
[09:57:09] <jay-ros> ARM has had its day in the sun, and it burned out 
[09:57:31] <jay-ros> just wait till x87 comes out!
[09:57:37] <Hunterkll> epony: all of them potentially, in fact
[09:57:46] <epony> it is on your HDD and SSD drive in the on-device controller board main chip
[09:57:52] <Hunterkll> https://www.scylladb.com/2021/09/16/aws-graviton2-arm-brings-better-price-performance-than-intel/
[09:57:53] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:57:56] <jay-ros> that'll be replaced with AMD and Intel shortly
[09:57:57] <epony> does that make them the SERVER market yet?
[09:57:58] <epony> :-)
[09:58:40] <Hunterkll> no, but the Graviton2 and Altra family do
[09:58:50] <jay-ros> intel have been working on hard drive on-device controller board main chips for the past six months and they're set to release in march with a product 3 times faster than the current competitor
[09:58:51] <epony> are they SBSA compliant?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Base_System_Architecture#Level_3
[09:58:55] <Hunterkll> which are implementations of... *checks notes* 
[09:58:57] <jay-ros> totally SBSA compliant
[09:59:04] <Hunterkll> Graviton 1.0 is Cortex-A72 cores
[09:59:29] <epony> cause last time I checked VMware was criticising the ARM performance and lack of standards and inability to run virtual machines
[09:59:30] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o xe0n
[09:59:47] <jay-ros> xe0n, you keep putting your pants on and taking them off
[09:59:49] <Hunterkll> epony: right, which is why AMD has a functional ARM version of ESXi then
[09:59:54] <Hunterkll> Graviton2 is Neoverse N1 cores
[10:00:30] <epony> must buy it then, at least several chips must have been shipped to some undescript warehouse with people peeing in bottles inside
[10:00:32] <Hunterkll> Altra CPUs are ARMv8.2 ISA, not sure which core is the basis for it though
[10:00:44] <Hunterkll> epony: ooooor it's powering major AWS offerings
[10:01:19] <Hunterkll> Some of Altra's ARM CPUs have TDPs of 200W+
[10:01:26] <epony> needs are "pee inside" marketing campaign as opposed to "intel inside" (from the times of pentium !!)
[10:01:51] <epony> 200W
[10:01:57] <Hunterkll> MS's Azure, Oracle, and VMware are all focusing on Altra hardware
[10:01:59] <epony> that's like a threadripper
[10:02:22] <epony> there was this seafile design that flopped after AMD cancelled it
[10:02:42] <Hunterkll> it was cancelled because GF killed the process that it was designed to use
[10:02:45] <Hunterkll> that was in 2014
[10:03:11] <Hunterkll> Altra's CPUs are currently Neoverse N1 cores too
[10:03:20] <Hunterkll> but they're moving to in-house designs instead of just licensed IP blocks that they modify 
[10:03:35] <epony> you know ARM is very popular because AMD uses it internally in the CPU as a management engine
[10:03:55] <epony> it's good as a micro-controller processor
[10:03:57] <jay-ros> we were talking about pizza and home food delivery before
[10:04:01] <Hunterkll> oh wow, an architecture can have more than one use case 
[10:04:03] <jay-ros> why did it get so nerdy in here?
[10:04:09] <Hunterkll> epony: and apparently, good as a general server processor too
[10:04:25] <epony> "AMD acquired the low-power server manufacturer SeaMicro in early 2012, with an eye to bringing out an ARM architecture server chip."

[10:05:32] <Hunterkll> https://www.anandtech.com/show/16315/the-ampere-altra-review
[10:05:48] <jay-ros> now you've got hunterkll tabbin'
[10:05:56] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_K12
[10:05:57] <Hunterkll> do note the pictures of that bog standard server hardware - except it's ARM based
[10:06:10] <Hunterkll> socketed CPUs and all
[10:06:13] <epony> "As of 2018 the product still hasn't been released, with development of ARM architectures continuing but no products planned."
[10:06:28] <Hunterkll> okay?
[10:06:38] <Hunterkll> AMD missed the boat just like intel did in the mid-2000s 
[10:06:40] <Hunterkll> no surprise
[10:07:11] <Hunterkll> https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ampere-altramax-benchmarks&num=1
[10:07:20] <Hunterkll> heh
[10:07:30] <Hunterkll> the Q80-33 apparently runs at 3.3ghz boost clock with a 250W TDP 
[10:07:56] <Hunterkll> oh neat
[10:08:04] <Hunterkll> you can go from the 80 core to the 128 core without changing motherboards
[10:08:07] <Hunterkll> drop in replacement
[10:08:26] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opteron#Supercomputers
[10:08:37] <Hunterkll> okay?
[10:08:48] <Hunterkll> like you keep linking examples that are pretty much irrelevent
[10:09:44] <Hunterkll> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25466063
[10:10:38] <Hunterkll> but barring that, the Neoverse N1 ARM core IP from ARM proper is designed as a server CPU core from the ground up 
[10:10:58] *** Quits: jay-ros (~jay-ros@user/jay-ros) (Quit: Leaving)
[10:12:12] <Hunterkll> but yes, your list of ARM uArchs is pretty much irrelevant, as any of them can be scaled/sized appropriately 
[10:17:15] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Atom#Competition "In 2014, ARM claimed that Intel's Atom processors offer less compatibility and lower performance than their chips when running Android"
[10:17:29] <Hunterkll> ... okay?
[10:17:30] <epony> like which person would run Android on X86 ;-)
[10:17:31] <Hunterkll> still not relevant 
[10:17:51] *** Quits: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c) (Quit: :P)
[10:18:15] <epony> it is relevant, since the Atom CPUs outperform ARM CPUs in the same thermal envelope and are used in servers
[10:18:27] <Hunterkll> except they don't?
[10:19:12] *** Quits: Aoyagi_raventop (~yags@user/aoyagi) (Quit: qat)
[10:19:30] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Atom_microprocessors#"Snow_Ridge"_(10_nm)
[10:19:52] <Hunterkll> epony: especially since, at that time, atom lacked OOE and was equivelent to a 486 in termes of instruction processing, severely hampering its performance
[10:20:17] <Hunterkll> but again, i've shown hard evidence that ARM is competitive with x86 in similar power envelopes with far lower prices 
[10:20:45] <epony> see "Integrated Intel Ethernet 800 series 100Gbps LAN"
[10:20:53] <Hunterkll> okay?
[10:20:58] <Hunterkll> that doesn't mean the CPU performs better
[10:21:00] <epony> like can ARM CPUs push more than 100 Mbps?
[10:21:05] <Hunterkll> the iphone XS CPU is more performant than the surfage Go's CPU lol
[10:21:11] <epony> that's like 1000:1
[10:21:14] <Hunterkll> yes.....
[10:21:16] <Hunterkll> yes th ey can.....
[10:21:42] <epony> where do they go, do they end up in a black hole in the iPhone?
[10:22:21] <Hunterkll> i mean
[10:22:26] <Hunterkll> the raw nu mbers are telling in their own right
[10:22:27] <Hunterkll> http://3s81si1s5ygj3mzby34dq6qf-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ampere-altra-vs-x86-table.jpg
[10:22:29] <layer8> Hunterkll: URL Title for http://3s81si1s5ygj3mzby34dq6qf-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ampere-altra-vs-x86-table.jpg - No title found.
[10:23:08] <Hunterkll> performance/watt and price/performance 
[10:23:11] <Hunterkll> are the critical numbers here
[10:23:41] <Hunterkll> though, performance/core is pretty telling too that it's pretty close to on-par with x86 offerings in that aspect alone
[10:24:11] <Hunterkll> and that's a huge driver as to why market share is increasing
[10:24:36] <Hunterkll> What this chart says is that basically for every dollar that you spend on a rack of servers using a pair of Xeon SP 8276 processors, you will get nearly four times as performance using a rack of the 180 watt Altra processors, and the multiples are 1.63X compared to a rack of systems based on the much more reasonably priced Xeon SP 6238R processors and 1.41X that of a rack of systems based on the aggressively priced 
[10:24:36] <Hunterkll> AMD Epyc 7702 processors
[10:25:37] <Hunterkll> Cloudflare too - is big on the ARM buyin
[10:25:42] <Hunterkll> https://blog.cloudflare.com/designing-edge-servers-with-arm-cpus/
[10:25:53] <epony> an 8C16T performance desktop CPU from AMD/Intel costs about $250-350 USD/1pc retail prices
[10:26:24] <Hunterkll> okay, but we're talking about servers
[10:26:27] <epony> has about 100W TDP
[10:26:38] <Hunterkll> also, what 8 core $350 machines are you buying lmao
[10:27:06] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_second#Timeline_of_instructions_per_second
[10:27:17] <Hunterkll> yea, you keep linking that flawed list
[10:27:17] <Hunterkll> again
[10:27:28] <Hunterkll> i've got hard specint numbers that show you up
[10:27:29] <Hunterkll> so keep trying
[10:27:37] <epony> it's flawed indeed, because Apple silicon does not exist ;-)
[10:27:38] <Hunterkll> among other benchmarks
[10:27:58] <epony> I mean, it's not on the list, cause it's a marketing name
[10:28:11] <Hunterkll> the M1 CPU does exist 
[10:28:18] <epony> see the ? marks in the list
[10:28:21] <Hunterkll> in-house design 
[10:28:27] <Hunterkll> still an ARM CPU however
[10:28:32] <epony> that's bacause of "chickenshit" failure to publish real information
[10:28:41] <epony> it can't compete
[10:28:49] <Hunterkll> LOL
[10:29:01] <Hunterkll> but i've shown you hard data - numbers, benchmarks, tests, sales figures, etc - that show it does and can 
[10:29:37] <Hunterkll> Also, ignoring that, the ARM architectures listed there are IP blocks up for tweaking - not actual production designs (though i'm sure some do just grab the ip block and say "fab this")
[10:29:49] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share_of_personal_computer_vendors#Top_vendors_market_share_(2021)
[10:29:54] <MOLNIJA> awoo
[10:29:55] <epony> you call that competition?
[10:30:20] <Hunterkll> given that half of those manufacturers are shipping ARM machines
[10:30:21] <Hunterkll> sure
[10:30:22] <Hunterkll> why not
[10:30:28] <MOLNIJA> "Apple Silicon does not exist"
[10:30:39] <MOLNIJA> So what does? TSMC?
[10:31:13] <epony> ARM cores and some implementers of SoCs
[10:31:15] <Hunterkll> so called "Apple silicon" is an ARMv8.4 implementation 
[10:31:24] <Hunterkll> epony: yea, Graviton and Altra aren't SOCs
[10:31:35] <Hunterkll> Altra, if you had seen the article I referenced, is traditional LGA socketed CPUs 
[10:31:37] <epony> it's not Apple, it's a lease from the competing real implementers
[10:31:55] <Hunterkll> erm, apple does their own design and just outsources the fabbing, just like AMD does
[10:31:55] <epony> like Apple is missing on the market before 2015
[10:32:01] <epony> (below 5%)
[10:32:07] <Hunterkll> okay?
[10:32:08] <Hunterkll> so?
[10:32:09] <Hunterkll> again
[10:32:16] <Hunterkll> we circle back to the fact that we were talking about servers
[10:32:20] <epony> you wanna check the mobile numbers too?
[10:32:20] <Hunterkll> stop moving the goal posts
[10:32:41] <Hunterkll> stick to one subject area at a time, please, instead of acting like a retarded headless chicken 
[10:32:48] <xe0n> smh...
[10:33:01] <Hunterkll> your whole premise is that ARM can't perform/deliver, and that's been conclusively proven false, so I have no idea why you keep reaching for strawman arguments
[10:33:31] <Hunterkll> and we all know ap ple isn't in the server market at all :)
[10:33:53] <Kiernian|Work> obviously, making people give up even when you're wrong means you're actually right in the end! Or at least, that's the tactic an old buddy of mine used to use when "debating" things, heh.
[10:34:12] <Hunterkll> Kiernian|Work: sure seems that way ;)
[10:37:12] <MOLNIJA> Hunterkll: I thought Altra was a half-SoC like epyc
[10:37:19] <Hunterkll> nope
[10:37:59] <epony> totally not supporting your 80486 claimed design:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels
[10:38:33] <epony> it can run software designed for those processors though
[10:38:48] <Hunterkll> epony: erm.....
[10:38:57] <Hunterkll> epony: my point was lack of OOE in early Atom units
[10:39:03] <Hunterkll> that's all i was commenting on for being 486 like
[10:39:08] <Hunterkll> MOLNIJA: https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3748.jpg
[10:39:12] <epony> actually they have it
[10:39:14] <Hunterkll> that's an Altra Q80 sys tem
[10:39:17] <Hunterkll> epony: they do *now*
[10:39:25] <epony> they are using an p6 microarchitecture from teh start
[10:39:40] <MOLNIJA> Hunterkll: Where's the Nbridge?
[10:39:42] <MOLNIJA> Sbridge?
[10:40:10] <Hunterkll> https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16315/X-T30_DSF3739.jpg
[10:40:15] <Hunterkll> i mean, it's also a multisocket design
[10:40:23] <Hunterkll> epony: they stripped a lot of features in the early atoms
[10:41:26] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnell_(microarchitecture)
[10:41:29] <MOLNIJA> is the PCH on the module like epyc or is it on the motherboard? Is there even a PCH?
[10:42:49] <epony> "This enables relatively good performance with only two integer ALUs, and without any instruction reordering, speculative execution or register renaming. A side effect of having no speculative execution is invulnerability against Meltdown and Spectre."

[11:40:52] <MOLNIJA> epony: You've linked a few cites for specifically x86 architectures
[11:41:01] <MOLNIJA> which, by the way, 100% run under translation now
[11:41:13] <epony> liberia is like siberia with more people per square kilometre, but the main difference is, in siberia, more people know about x86 than about your arm
[11:41:21] <MOLNIJA> and you said translation is slow and bad. why promote x86 at all, then?
[11:41:23] <SirSceptalot> MOLNIJA, it wasn't a very funny joke to begin with. I w... ha, there, epony got it

[11:43:48] <MOLNIJA> they're not

[11:43:59] <epony> oh, you will see

[11:52:37] <JollyRgrs> i thought you had left

[11:52:45] <MOLNIJA> I got disillusioned and nearly switched back to windows.

[11:53:06] <SirSceptalot> sometimes doors are better
[11:53:44] <epony> you know the real fans of WIN/DOS have Apple laptop^W tablets
[11:54:20] <SirSceptalot> fans can be good too, small ones and big ones
[11:54:48] <epony> I like laptops that work alright even when their fan is stuck for 1-2 years.
[11:55:06] <epony> *real tablets for grown ups* ^
[11:55:10] <SirSceptalot> if you get an ARM laptop, you don't even need a fan ;)
[11:55:22] <epony> you'll need prostate pills though
[11:55:29] <epony> cause you'd be senile age
[11:55:38] <SirSceptalot> oi
[11:55:50] <epony> and will be thinking what a young posture that tim cook has
[11:55:50] <SirSceptalot> I only forget most things, not everything
[11:56:09] <SirSceptalot> and my surface pro x is a nippy little device, thank you very much
[11:56:20] <epony> the secret of Apple marketing is accentuating on details you don't care about
[11:57:16] <epony> but that's an ARM CPU tablet with X86 to ARM translation, so it kind of more or less sucks and blows, even without a fan
[11:57:35] <epony> cause it's software translation
[11:57:40] <epony> (emulation)
[11:58:11] *** Emet-Selch is now known as haise01
[11:58:17] *** haise01 is now known as Azem
[11:58:41] <epony> you can get 5-10 second hand laptops for that price ;-) and have all of them running x86 applications that are both free and efficient
[11:59:08] <SirSceptalot> the reason why I haven't taken part in most of this conversation is because I'm well out my depth, but doesn't it run a native ARM version of windows, and native arm programs?
[11:59:17] <SirSceptalot> Yes, I do know it can emulate x86 programs though
[11:59:23] <Azem> and why would I want second hand laptop ? If I am getting laptop I am looking for warranty as first thing in case shit breaks
[11:59:33] <epony> hahaha
[11:59:41] <epony> nice ;-)
[11:59:54] <epony> let me sell you about 10 warranties without a laptop then
[11:59:59] <DrZak> i am surprised at the level of emotions this discussion often brings
[12:00:10] <DrZak> why would anybody care what cpu architecture is used..

[12:00:39] <epony> got a subscription to lose?
[12:00:45] <DrZak> with little software for it
[12:01:04] <DrZak> no that crapple bought in, its a bit more powerful, but there's still very little software for it
[12:01:38] <DrZak> when software gets developed and its working on par with x86 systems, ppl will simply switch 
[12:01:41] <DrZak> no need for drama
[12:01:51] <epony> the entire essense of the ARM shilling is to sell you crappy hardware for the cost of nice hardware, so you have to pay monthly rentals for everything thereafter, like a total fast loans person
[12:02:15] <Azem> :|
[12:02:21] <DrZak> arm shilling?
[12:02:31] <DrZak> is that a new currency? :D
[12:03:24] <epony> ah yeah, don't you know it's fancy marketing that Apple and MSFT and GOOG need to sell more ARMlettes and Chlorebooks

[12:05:08] <DrZak> and developers/gfx designers are a tiny group compared to all people using computers
[12:05:56] <epony> so you think the 96% of 1.5-2 billion PCs are a tiny group
[12:06:19] <DrZak> he?
[12:06:19] <SirSceptalot> epony, I actually gave someone a one-button keyboard as a gift

[12:06:32] <epony> that's fun

[12:06:56] <SirSceptalot> I love sharing my super interesting stories like that
[12:07:02] <epony> I'd give them a "buy" button model, cause that's more American, you know.. but you know better what you're doing with the delete key ;-)
[12:07:08] <DrZak> no, i mean vast majority of systems for users (so not servers) have very tiny use these days

[13:11:22] <SirSceptalot> Sounds like something one would have in the land of the free
[13:11:24] <Oliber> membership in an HoA is often required when you purcahse a house in the development, because they manage maintenance of common areas/services
[13:11:25] * SirSceptalot ducks
[13:13:38] <Oliber> depending where you are, they get quite excited about additional constraints - like your gardens must be well maintained to help minimise spread of weeds and make the area look nice; then some Karen will decide to vote in a new rule that stipulates the exact length of grass or something and people start getting fined
[13:13:51] <sd> 02<M‚Äãitchy93> Even for suburban houses?
[13:14:11] <Oliber> suburbia is where most HoAs exist

[13:14:48] <sd> 02<M‚Äãitchy93> Or a right goodnight
[13:15:44] <Oliber> in the UK they call them management companies, and for the most part - they just require you contribute to the maintenance funds, some areas the local council won't adopt the roads or sewerage systems, so the maintenance has to be paid by the home owners
[13:16:00] <sd> 02<M‚Äãitchy93> Fuck that
[13:16:14] <sd> 02<M‚Äãitchy93> We have strata here but there's no membership, they just do apartment stuff
[13:17:12] <Oliber> when my parents lived out in the country side, the redevelopment of the farm buildings meant that a new septic tank had to be installed, everyone had to pay maintenance towards it; it wasn't a huge amount of money, but it makes sense

[13:21:52] <Oliber> but sharing the costs of maintaining services within a housing development/community also makes sense, it's what your local taxes pay for in most places/older developments

[13:23:32] <sd> 02<M‚Äãitchy93> If the council is under funded, you just get potholes
[13:27:50] <Oliber> i think the UK precedent for that kinda stuff started in the 80s (probably wrong, but eh), and it's proliferated more, pretty frustrating; luckily my current house my bill is around ¬£150 a year for maintenance of one open area, there are some restrictive covenants around making sure that the plants that were originally put in stay similar, and that's it

[13:45:50] <Kiernian|Work> HoA's aren't all bad. The good ones have stipulations saying everyone on the board has to be a dues-paying resident who cannot use their position on the board to benefit either themselves or any business acquaintances.
[13:46:01] <Kiernian|Work> and then don't pay board members
[13:46:27] <Kiernian|Work> then it's just stuff like managing all the funds so that there's enough money to replace everyone's roof after a hailstorm
[13:46:35] <Kiernian|Work> or every 10 years, or whatever

[13:52:23] <Kiernian|Work> where I lived and was on the board, the interior was the homeowner's responsibility and the exterior was the association's responsibility.
[13:52:55] <Kiernian|Work> so siding or painting, roof repair, driveway repair, mowing, snow removal, etc
[13:53:24] <Kiernian|Work> all was part of the VERY REASONABLE dues. Like, $100something a month when most associations charged 3 times taht

[14:25:43] <Oliber> Kiernian|Work: it's a bit of an odd arrangement if you own the house, but if it works - it works
[14:27:06] <Kiernian|Work> I thought it worked great, ex-wife hated everything about it, but hey, she picked the house, heh.
[14:31:01] <Kiernian|Work> but I *really*, REALLY hate mowing the lawn, so I'll tolerate a whole lot in order to avoid doing that.

[14:32:07] <Kiernian|Work> I tried suggesting while I was on the board that we allow indigenous plant life and provided studies by the local university where they were reclaiming stuff that way and it was bringing back butterfly and bee populations because...crabgrass is native, never needs to be watered, and doesn't need mowing.
[14:32:20] <SirSceptalot> while technically correct, I would suggest a mowing robot above CptLuxx 's proposal

[14:35:52] <Kiernian|Work> my objection to mowing and watering lawns is partially a moral one. If it doesn't want to grow there in the conditions it's planted in without help, it doesn't need to be there.
[14:36:18] <Kiernian|Work> it's a waste of water, and most importantly, time and effort
[14:37:24] <Oliber> the grass loves this place, because the builders haven't capped a water pipe that they used when building the properties, so our lawn loves it, but it does have a bit of a mud patch in the middle where the pipe is

[15:48:48] <sd> 13<C‚Äãolour> Yeah I don't think it's fair to have to sit through ads especially after the years people have not dealt with ads. It wasn't normal 10-15 years ago and with adblock people have staved it off from being the new normal.

[19:04:29] <mistiry> it also had IR receiver, and i trolled HS classes a bunch with the universal remote app
[19:04:37] <vinrock> i didnt still have my treo but i found one in a box on the shelf here and its the same one
[19:04:45] <vinrock> cant fire it up tho bcuz of proprietary charger i dont have 
[19:04:54] <signofzeta> vinrock: Mac-formatted floppies, since that's what my school had.  The middle school had PCs, though
[19:05:00] <mistiry> yep everything had proprietary cables back then
[19:05:26] <vinrock> yup apple IIgs in elementary school and then macs in middle school
[19:05:28] <MOLNIJA> awaa
[19:05:29] <MOLNIJA> awoo
[19:05:36] <vinrock> hs was pc's
[19:05:54] <signofzeta> Now it's all USB-C, but good luck determining if it's USB 3.2 Gen1/2/3, USB4, Power Delivery supported, Thunderbolt 3 or 4... it almost makes you miss proprietary cables.  (almost)
[19:06:15] <vinrock> i kinda like how the same conector can do a buncha shit now
[19:06:42] <signofzeta> I bought a few USB-C cables online to clean up my desk.  Turns out they were charging-only cables.
[19:06:49] <vinrock> lol
[19:06:55] <vinrock> that sucks
[19:07:15] <signofzeta> meh, I'm sure I'll get more USB-C stuff as time goes on
[19:07:19] <vinrock> i just bought a ton of patch cables from fs
[19:07:22] <SirSceptalot> those things shouldn't exist

[19:07:50] <SirSceptalot> I love me some USB-C
[19:07:52] <signofzeta> and who knows if they support USB-C Power Delivery or not, or to what wattage
[19:07:58] <SirSceptalot> exactly
[19:08:08] <SirSceptalot> It's a whole mess
[19:08:24] <signofzeta> hopefully USB4 fixes it somehow
[19:08:43] <SirSceptalot> I'll just be happy if they don't rename the older standards again
[19:09:21] <signofzeta> USB 1.1 is now USB 2.0 Low/Full Speed.  USB 3.0 -> USB 3.1 Gen1 -> USB 3.2 Gen1.
[19:10:04] <vinrock> i hate how they change names of old shit
[19:10:15] <fritzwastaken> lol you sound so old

[19:10:23] <fritzwastaken> "Stop changing things! Im just getting used to it!"
[19:10:25] <signofzeta> especially when USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 used to be two very different things
[19:12:10] <SirSceptalot> yeah, sounding old or not, having a thing 1.0 and then renaming it to thing 2.0 when thing 3.0 is released is just too dumb to even have to explain

[20:50:07] <monr0e> I'm reasonably sure that in the UK, even if you have a rifle or a shotgun license, you still can't use them in self defense. I could be wrong on that, though
[20:50:16] <Activ8> they publicly put info about which isn't true usually

[20:52:20] <JollyRgrs> cuz u ded
[20:52:26] <monr0e> And the first time you submit a license application you need a home visit. The idea being to secure confidence in that person's ability and intent to own, maintain, and use the gun in the fashion it has been licensed for
[20:52:27] <fritzwastaken> Yup!
[20:52:48] <fritzwastaken> monr0e: Why cant they do that shit for people who want kids?
[20:52:55] <PublicWifi> wtf

[20:53:45] <PublicWifi> maybe have some empathy for your fellow man or something idk
[20:53:49] <fritzwastaken> We do not need more representation from certain gene pools
[20:54:01] <PublicWifi> thats all a matter of perspective
[20:54:02] <monr0e> Powerlevelling a bit, but given the upbringing my mother gave me, I wholeheartedly agree with a more robust planning process to have children. Our care system os so overstretched it is unreal. 
[20:54:21] <PublicWifi> you willing to force your subjectivity on someone else? :(
[20:54:28] <signofzeta> monr0e, fritzwastaken: I think they do that if you want to adopt a kid.  But making one yourself is free.
[20:54:29] <monr0e> Perhaps licensing is a bit of a stretch, but something to evaluate a set of parents could be useufl
[20:54:51] <PublicWifi> and who sets the code for the eval
[20:54:58] <PublicWifi> that doesn't sound like it could be abused at all
[20:54:59] <PublicWifi> -.-
[20:55:08] <monr0e> In the UK you have to pas extraordinarily stringent checks to foster children, and the process for adoption is only slightly less lengthy

[20:57:26] <fritzwastaken> we can discuss things like civil human beings
[20:58:39] <monr0e> He does raise a point, mind you. Any such process would need significant oversight and a robust complaints process
[20:59:37] <fritzwastaken> Oh no I dont actually think it would be feasible to do
[20:59:48] <fritzwastaken> But there are a lot of shitty parents out there and way too many damned kids
[21:00:09] <fritzwastaken> Lukcily this generation is doing our part and just not having kids
[21:00:28] <monr0e> Perhaps it would be simpler to have a national birth control program, and once a person is on that program, they would have to go through the same style of procedure to come off that program as one does to have an abortion. The point being, it is not impossible for any couple to have children, but the process ensures that the decision is not taken lightly. 
[21:00:40] <monr0e> It would also not be mandatory to take par in the program
[21:01:15] <monr0e> The principle here is that it would reduce the number of "accidental" pregnancies to a much lower number

[23:04:33] <PublicWiFi> thats why estranger is the man
[23:04:39] <estranger> billions dont scare me hehe

[23:04:52] <PublicWiFi> kafka
[23:04:52] <estranger> its the latency requirements for a fully durable system w/ DR
[23:05:13] <PattyCakes> even he can't build a real time trading system at a sub 1ms response time with the kind of data rquirements
[23:05:13] <PublicWiFi> when you say kafka three times in a row teh earth quakes
[23:05:20] <fritzwastaken> ah ty ty PattyCakes thats what I was planning just wanted to make sure
[23:05:27] <fritzwastaken> its only 15tb womp womp
[23:05:51] <PattyCakes> trading platforms work on Deciseconds not Miliseconds
[23:05:59] <fritzwastaken> I sent PublicWiFi a screenshot of one of our storage devices with 8500PB of storage and he almost shit himself
[23:06:06] <PattyCakes> wait, reverse that
[23:06:11] <PattyCakes> I'll stop talking cause I'm retarded
[23:06:17] <fritzwastaken> I felt bad when I told him the jbod was mis-representing the storage and it was only 10pb
[23:06:28] <PublicWiFi> :(
[23:06:41] <PattyCakes> anyways fritzwastaken, the size really isn't a huge deal - it's how many files you have
[23:06:54] <PattyCakes> a billion small files is harder to sync than a thousand large files
[23:06:58] <PattyCakes> you know dis
[23:07:16] <fritzwastaken> I actually have no idea how our storage devices are used
[23:07:23] <fritzwastaken> not sure if its a ton of small files or bigguns

[23:31:48] <int0x1C8> WI, a few months before CC became legal
[23:32:03] <PublicWiFi> was the gun visible?
[23:32:07] <int0x1C8> so they tried to charge me with carrying a concealed and deadly weapon
[23:32:08] <int0x1C8> yes
[23:32:10] <int0x1C8> obviously
[23:32:13] <PublicWiFi> so how is that concealed
[23:32:15] <PublicWiFi> lmfao

[23:33:26] <PattyCakes> being held at gunpoint is an experiance to say the least
[23:33:37] <PattyCakes> shook me for quite a while - sure it took you a little bit too int0x1C8 
[23:33:42] <mistiry> i had a helicopter chase me once
[23:33:44] <mistiry> that was fun
[23:34:08] <PublicWiFi> meanwhile in my state my brother in law caught a guy breaking into his car at 3am. my BiL too the guy at gunpoint and made him walk to the end of the street where a cop lived and made the guy ring his doorbell lmao
[23:34:09] <int0x1C8> ADA didn't want to drop the case because I dunno
[23:34:10] <mistiry> searchlight followed me down the highway, bunch of cops eventually surrounded me, guns drawn, etc.
[23:34:18] <vinrock> i had a cop put a gun to my head for rolling a blunt in the park after dark
[23:34:21] <vinrock> that was entertaining
[23:34:37] <vinrock> mistiry we call those
[23:34:38] <vinrock> ghetto birds
[23:34:46] <PattyCakes> fuck int0x1C8, same here lol. Nobody wanted to be the person who dropped charges
[23:34:47] <int0x1C8> so had to pay $5000 to a lawyer for him to go above the ADA's head to the DA and say "yo wtf is this charging him for concealed carry of a deadly weapon, it was none of those 3 things"
[23:35:00] <mistiry> funny thing is i didnt do _anything_. my car was "similar" to a car that hit a cop on the side of the road and ran
[23:35:15] <mistiry> but i had the full 4-star-GTA experience
[23:35:18] <PattyCakes> are you literally me int0x1C8? That's what my lawyer charged for pre-trial services
[23:35:20] <vinrock> thats awesome
[23:35:37] <mistiry> chopper above with the light, dozen or so cars coming up behind me
[23:35:42] <PattyCakes> then another 10k to fight it ready for trial
[23:35:47] <PattyCakes> and the bail was retarded
[23:35:54] <int0x1C8> PattyCakes, I had a full blown break down about a month later, stopped leaving my apartment, stopped going to work, stopped talking to anyone
[23:36:06] <mistiry> my favorite part was the end
[23:36:06] <vinrock> fuck that

[23:36:18] <int0x1C8> went into the hospital for a bit because of that
[23:36:26] <vinrock> lolwat
[23:36:29] <vinrock> mistiry
[23:36:31] <PattyCakes> int0x1C8, my lawyer had to hold me as we walked out of one of my monthly court appearances after the charges were dropped
[23:36:31] <mistiry> yep
[23:36:38] <mistiry> also not even the same make/model of car
[23:36:54] <mistiry> i was in my geo metro. they were looking for i think it was a ford focus or aspire or some other small ford
[23:36:55] <PattyCakes> once we got outside, I literally collapsed and cried 
[23:37:08] <vinrock> oh man
[23:37:14] <vinrock> you had to sufer through geo metro ownership im sorry
[23:37:18] <mistiry> like ya'll literally chased me with a chopper and didnt even get the car right
[23:37:20] <mistiry> man i loved my geo
[23:37:22] <vinrock> 3cyl of fury
[23:37:22] <PublicWiFi> counter sue or naw?
[23:37:36] <int0x1C8> it wasn't that dramatic for me, we met with the lawyer, he was like "I'm a former DA here, I know the current one, and he'll agree this is bullshit"
[23:38:13] <PattyCakes> int0x1C8, lawyer said the same thing basically "Just waiting for the politics of this to blow over"
[23:38:17] <PattyCakes> took 13 months
[23:38:35] <mistiry> vinrock: i had 2 kicker 12" subs in it
[23:38:36] <PattyCakes> weekly UAs, monthly checkins with the bond agent and court
[23:38:41] <int0x1C8> and later he came back with "yeah he dropped it to a ticket offense, basically displaying a facsimile firearm, its like $150"

[23:41:35] <PattyCakes> good one Activ8

[23:42:32] <PattyCakes> they kicked the correct door in
[23:42:42] <mistiry> when my (now) wife moved states to live with me, i took her car in and got it limo tinted and had a custom box made with the same 12"s i had in the geo
[23:42:45] <Activ8> Oh I see so you where charged then?
[23:42:50] <PattyCakes> oh very much so
[23:43:02] <Activ8> sweet what sentence or fine did you get?
[23:43:11] <PattyCakes> charges dropped, charge expunged
[23:43:17] <mistiry> once for fun i hooked up those 12's to my TV sound system
[23:43:28] <PattyCakes> just because you did nothing wrong, doesn't mean they won't charge you
[23:43:29] <mistiry> worked out ok but not enough power
[23:43:36] <Activ8> that‚Äôs not a charge then or a fine so you got away with it?
[23:44:09] <int0x1C8> yeah, and even if it's completely at fault PDs have no requirement to reimburse for damages
[23:44:44] <vinrock> mistiry when i was like 15, the local broken home that all the kids would congretate at we had a subwoofer closet
[23:44:58] <PattyCakes> Activ8 not how it works here. First off, I'll ignore the "getting away with it" but you can 100% be arrested, charged and tried for a crime you may or may not have committed
[23:45:00] <vinrock> 18's in like, a broom closet ran off a home amp
[23:45:06] <mistiry> lol nice
[23:45:06] <vinrock> youd stand in there and go deaf
[23:45:08] <int0x1C8> there's a famous instance of this where a SWAT team raided a "drug house" but went to the wrong house in a different part of town even, and during the raid a fire started
[23:45:16] <int0x1C8> the house burnt down completely

[23:45:48] <vinrock> they said, sorry not sorry
[23:45:49] <int0x1C8> the owners sued the PD for compensation for wrongful damages, and court dismissed it outright with qualified immunity

[23:47:55] <PattyCakes> either way, you can be charged for anything, by any sworn court officer (which includes peace officers and police)
[23:48:01] <vinrock> the only thing my boys truck was missing was an airbrushed chola on the hood
[23:48:09] <mistiry> had all the interior and exterior lighting and stuff. at one point was sponsored by some place idk who
[23:48:12] <int0x1C8> they have a "generalized" duty to respond, but not a specific duty, so if someone breaks in, and you call 911 saying there's someone here about to kill and rob me
[23:48:15] <vinrock> oh nice
[23:48:30] <vinrock> i only went to one sound competition and it was tooo much for me
[23:48:31] <int0x1C8> and the police don't even send anyone, they can't be held liable for your death
