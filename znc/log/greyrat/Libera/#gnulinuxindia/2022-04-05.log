[10:10:19] <gtlsgamr> Hello firemds
[10:24:43] <daksh[m]> hello
[10:26:17] <gtlsgamr> wazza
[10:29:04] <iamak[m]> If I change my username, do I need to change my home directory name also?
[10:38:21] <AryaK[m]>  maybe but its useful to do so
[10:50:08] <daksh[m]> you dont need to
[11:07:10] <Amit[m]> Have Anyone Knows About "Haxe" and "Crystal" Language Uses?
[11:09:02] <daksh[m]> crystal is good for web dev ive heard
[11:09:13] <daksh[m]> invidious is made in crystal
[11:11:29] <theo[m]> <daksh[m]> "> <@telegram_1371655671:t2bot.io..." <- see?
[11:11:29] <theo[m]> lol
[11:11:29] <theo[m]> i thought we were the only one
[11:20:58] <iamak[m]> <daksh[m]> "you dont need to" <- If I don't change will it create new directory like `/home/newuser` and use it?
[11:21:41] <iamak[m]> <AryaK[m]> " maybe but its useful to do so" <- If I change, will the `$HOME` (and similar) vars get changed automatically or I'll have to manually change?
[11:22:35] <AryaK[m]> just create a new user
[11:22:38] <AryaK[m]> its way more simple
[11:22:45] <AryaK[m]> and stuff wont break too bad
[11:27:09] <iamak[m]> I want to change my username but
[11:27:19] <iamak[m]> It's my real name
[11:27:40] <iamak[m]> Have to edit it everytime I share anything by copy pasting
[11:28:59] <as08[m]> Guys i just connected my phone with my laptop having arch Linux on it my phone says yeah i am connected to a system infact when I do adb devices on my laptop it works fine but i don't know how to access files of my phone
[11:38:50] <iamak[m]> I just use `adb push` or `adb pull`
[11:39:07] <iamak[m]> You can use Media Transfer Protocol though
[11:39:50] <iamak[m]> Read about it [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Media_Transfer_Protocol?useskinversion=1)
[11:44:39] <Prit[m]> Choose in android to transfer files instead of charging that device
[11:48:26] <as08[m]> <iamak[m]> "You can use Media Transfer..." <- Thnx
[11:48:36] <as08[m]> Prit[m]: Lol I'm not on windows
[11:49:12] <Prit[m]> Works for me in linux too
[11:49:47] <as08[m]> Ohk
[11:49:52] <as08[m]> Distro ?
[11:51:12] <iamak[m]> as08[m]: It works regardless of OS
[11:51:22] <iamak[m]> Because it tells Android to start the MTP
[11:51:37] <iamak[m]> Otherwise Android treats your PC as just another charger
