[02:29:27] <velvet1> im building a ccna home lab anyone know of any low power switches or routers?
[02:30:16] <Cl0udNinja> any should be low power as long as you disable unused ports and all that fun stuff
[02:30:31] <e1> who packer
[02:30:38] * Cl0udNinja packs ur mum
[02:30:44] <Cl0udNinja> Packer.. packer.io
[02:31:11] <e1> zz
[02:31:15] <Cl0udNinja> velvet1, it will only use lots of power when its under heavy load. further power savings can be had by turning off things its not using
[02:31:46] <velvet1> gotcha
[02:31:47] <Cl0udNinja> when it says 10A, that is peak/max. it wont always be using 10A
[02:32:25] <velvet1> will they make a lot of noice?
[02:33:02] <velvet1> i was looking at the 1921 router because i was told it wouldn't but they are expensive
[02:33:17] <velvet1> more than they should
[02:33:24] <e1> I mean.. yea and no

[02:37:40] <Cl0udNinja> noise-wise, you'll get a fuck ton of noise at startup before the controller tones them down, and that will give you a baseline for the max noise. generally you probably wont hear it unless its got crazy ineffecient fans in them
[02:38:24] <velvet1> yea at boot thats understandable

[04:05:23] <signofzeta> "Hey Cortana, are you still there?"
[04:06:20] <signofzeta> Yes, Win11 requires UEFI with Secure Boot enabled, a 64-bit processor (sorry, early Intel Atoms), and TPM 2.0.
[04:06:31] <xe0n> yep good
[04:06:33] <signofzeta> Not saying it's the year of Linux on the desktop, but... okay, it's not.
[04:07:03] <enix> nope. not until anti-cheats come to the party
[04:07:05] <xe0n> its not we havent had those requirements there (and pretty much default) for the last couple of years lol
[04:07:49] <signofzeta> Well, no, Win10 boots on 32-bit BIOS systems without TPM's.
[04:07:56] <xe0n> if you're deploying a desktop in the enterprise without UEFI and secure boot enabled, errr you've been doing it wrong for awhile lol
[04:08:00] <signofzeta> Though to be fair, macOS kissed 32-bit Intel goodbye years ago.
[04:08:04] <xe0n> oh please, who has done a 32 bit install recently
[04:08:05] <xe0n> lol
[04:08:14] <enix> Me?
[04:08:16] <xe0n> yeah this isnt going to affect much, and for those where it does, they'll stick with win 10
[04:08:18] <signofzeta> I agree, xe0n.  My co-workers are morons and don't check boot modes before they start.
[04:08:19] <xe0n> which will be still be supported
[04:08:20] <xe0n> soo
[04:08:23] <enix> I run everything on 32 bit. Not everything has gone 64 xe0n 
[04:08:43] <witheringwanton> enix, enterprise went 64 bit years ago lol
[04:08:49] <signofzeta> Though my work computer is UEFI/Secure Boot but only has TPM 1.2.  Perhaps I can upgrade the firmware.  HP released a tool years back for some models.
[04:09:21] <sd> 05<r​mg22893> lol one of the old-ass apps we have that some people use requires disabling secure boot/DEP so guess those people won't be upgrading

[04:12:09] <signofzeta> Oh, and a DirectX 12 GPU is required.  I've been out of the gaming scene for too long to know if it's important.
[04:12:55] <witheringwanton> I've been using linux for 12 years now. feels weird

[04:38:44] <xe0n> yeah, for devs and sysadmins
[04:38:46] <xe0n> consumers, not so much
[04:38:47] <xe0n> lol

[04:40:47] <Cl0udNinja> man, its no wonder LA has such shitty problems... they re-tarred my street like 2 years ago. and now they are totally grating and redoing it

[04:41:50] <enix> I'll be sure to keep you in my thoughts while i get my steering realigned for the bajillionth time due to all the shit roads we have
[04:42:17] <Cl0udNinja> the roads right around me are the last ones that should be being re-done
[04:42:27] <enix> so you live in a rich area
[04:42:37] <Cl0udNinja> idk, not really
[04:42:44] <Cl0udNinja> its like good block bad block here
[04:42:46] <enix> thats what a rich person would say
[04:43:05] <Cl0udNinja> I live on a 'meh' block. shit goes down on all sides of me, but rarely this block

[04:43:42] <enix> all the parents lived in my suburb, so they would do all their drugs and stabbings in the areas around me but leave my place alone
[04:43:54] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[04:44:12] <enix> we legit had fuck all break-ins/theft in my area
[04:44:16] <Cl0udNinja> you go one street south of me, and its even nicer, you go one block north and its sketchy
[04:44:26] <enix> you go one suburb over some crazy cunt was scaling apartments and going in via the balcony
[04:44:26] * DoTheNeedful throws punches
[04:44:52] <Cl0udNinja> you've never locked yourself out before?
[04:44:53] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[04:45:17] <signofzeta> Pfff, I live next to active train tracks.  The state mandates they blow their horn at every road crossing.
[04:45:18] <enix> heh i can break into my own place all g
[04:45:36] <Cl0udNinja> idk if it means I live in a good or bad neighborhood, but I've been seen 'breaking in' to my own place because I locked myself out. no one said a word to me
[04:45:51] <enix> Cl0udNinja: no that's normal. noone gives a fuck
[04:46:04] <enix> i saw someone breaking into a car and asked if she needed help, then broke in for her
[04:46:14] <enix> and then i was like 'wait.. do you own this car?'
[04:46:19] <Cl0udNinja> loool
[04:47:09] <Cl0udNinja> I've had to do it enough times I can do it myself, with just about anything
[04:47:29] <enix> heh i haven't had to break into my jeep yet, thank god
[04:47:31] <Cl0udNinja> I've used swords, hangers, sticks, string..
[04:47:35] <enix> swords
[04:47:39] <Cl0udNinja> yeah lmao
[04:47:43] <Cl0udNinja> to reach the lock button
[04:48:11] <Cl0udNinja> wasnt my sword, and wasnt my car, both were my roommates. but I ended up doing it for them because they couldnt figure it out
[04:48:14] <enix> I can totally see you wearing your hair in a pony tail with a fedora on busting out a sword like "let me help you milady"
[04:48:38] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[04:49:07] <Cl0udNinja> I've never owned a sword. but I did used to have long hair, and never could manage to make a hat look good

These PCs must clean install back to Windows 10 with the media (ISOs) that we provide and can then join the Release Preview Channel to preview Windows 10 updates.

[05:03:09] <xe0n> kinda goes back to why they have been pressured by OEMs for most of this
[05:03:28] <enix> why were oems pressuring?
[05:03:43] <xe0n> because they want to sell hardware, reality is consumers dont "upgrade" to a new windows, they buy new pcs
[05:03:56] <xe0n> so if you're going to buy a PC in 2 years time and it looks the same as what you have now, why upgrade?
[05:04:01] <xe0n> sure we know why....general consumers dont

[05:05:16] <xe0n> yep
[05:05:32] <xe0n> and its those pc repair shop folk "ohhh just stick a new ssd and more memory in, should be good to go"
[05:05:37] <Work-BWMerlin> I have a Windows 2008 server still in production
[05:05:38] <xe0n> if a machine has a win7 sticker, it should've never got win10
[05:05:44] <xe0n> okay? ive got plenty too
[05:05:45] <xe0n> lol
[05:05:56] <enix> I had windows 2003 lol
[05:06:05] <enix> fucking... *****HAD******
[05:06:20] <Work-BWMerlin> I also have "made for vista" and "made for windows 7" machines (running 10 [I hope]) still around
[05:06:30] <xe0n> yeah thats bad lol
[05:06:37] <xe0n> pc shop mentality
[05:07:06] <Work-BWMerlin> Going to see if I can have them replaced next year (putting them in my budget)
[05:07:11] <enix> not everyone can afford new pc's every year
[05:07:16] <xe0n> exactly?
[05:07:19] <enix> vista/7 is a bit old but still
[05:07:20] <xe0n> you dont need a new pc every year
[05:07:31] <enix> even we're swapping out the vistas/7's I've found
[05:07:32] <xe0n> but every 5-7 years is a pretty good number
[05:07:35] <Work-BWMerlin> First budget is going to be a doozie, going to be big and miss some stuff that I am simply not aware of
[05:07:41] <xe0n> you run longer, great! you've got your moneys worth
[05:07:45] <xe0n> but otherwise, its pretty standard
[05:07:52] <enix> 5-7 years is good
[05:08:06] <Work-BWMerlin> Windows 10 is five years old, IMO that is how long a desktop PC should be warranted for
[05:08:13] <xe0n> in a business, yes
[05:08:17] <xe0n> home, get another year or two
[05:08:31] <enix> honestly, you should get more imo
[05:08:37] <xe0n> eh
[05:08:44] <Work-BWMerlin> I want to get some of those SFF ones that bolt onto the back of monitors.  I think most staff can use an i3 with 8gb and 256GB SSD
[05:08:52] <xe0n> those suck
[05:08:56] <xe0n> get standard SFF machines
[05:09:04] <xe0n> you'll be much better off
[05:09:15] <enix> omg pfy was trying to convince $Boss to get the little mini sff ones that are a monitor stand
[05:09:17] <enix> have you seen them
[05:09:25] <xe0n> and you'll want more than i3, i5 for business minimum
[05:09:29] <Work-BWMerlin> lol my home machine is old, got an old xeon 1230 in it
[05:09:39] <xe0n> only needs someone to run a big excel file or something, chip is done
[05:09:42] <Work-BWMerlin> But boy is it stable
[05:10:03] <enix> wait Work-BWMerlin do you guys run vdi
[05:10:08] <Work-BWMerlin> Nope
[05:10:11] <enix> ah nvm
[05:10:13] <enix> yeah i5 or better
[05:10:17] <enix> all our i3's are fucking trash
[05:10:41] <xe0n> i3 is not good for business except for light tasks, anytime you got someone running multiple worksheets, outlook, teams, and a browser, it'll struggle
[05:10:54] <Work-BWMerlin> What gen i3?  Our stuff is so old that I cannot imagine a new gen i3 not being better than what they have, especially if I can get NVMe SSD vs SATA SSD
[05:11:00] <sd> 05<r​mg22893> our default desktop config is an i3 with 16gb of RAM lmao
[05:11:08] <xe0n> the latest gen?
[05:11:14] <xe0n> if you're buying pcs, you're buying the latest gen lol
[05:11:47] <Work-BWMerlin> That depends, some OEM's are so hard up for parts they are still shipping old CPU's
[05:11:47] <enix> or Work-BWMerlin do you buy from gov
[05:12:01] <enix> oh that reminds me brb
[05:12:07] <xe0n> Work-BWMerlin...any modern pc you buy will either be latest or one step behind, lol
[05:13:35] <Work-BWMerlin> I am in private (though they will tell you they are not private) education (in a poor suburb).
[05:15:20] <xe0n> okay? you can still budget to put them in a good position
[05:15:47] <xe0n> you buy underpowered machines, you'll be forking out money to replace them sooner, or worse is have staff complain they're slow lol
[05:15:59] <xe0n> you should be looking at i5 minimum, and if you're buying in volume, any AM will get you special pricing
[05:16:04] <enix> s/f c/f constantly c
[05:16:05] <layer8> xe0n meant: "you buy underpowered machines, you'll be forking out money to replace them sooner, or worse is have staff constantly complain they're slow lol"
[05:17:15] <Work-BWMerlin> I am aware but I just don't know if staff will push an i3 that hard especially and i3 desktop vs the i3 that is in the MacBook Air's that some staff have.
[05:17:43] <Work-BWMerlin> I thought i5 16GB with 256 NVMe but I don't know if that is wasteful.
[05:18:01] <xe0n> then go to 8gb and 16gb on the machines you know will get higher\heavier use
[05:18:09] <xe0n> i5\8gb\256 is a pretty standard config lol
[05:18:40] <xe0n> 16gb on workstations is great, but standard 8gb does the job these days for the workload i described ^
[05:19:01] <enix> I know we gave i3's to staff that were doing email, a little excel, some Word, and some web browsering, and they rejoiced at hte i5 upgrade
[05:19:14] <enix> the i3's also didnt last as long. Started becoming a little tedious to use after a couple of years
[05:19:40] <enix> That means they were probably about five years old by the time we started having issues, but we only got 2 years of use out of them (we buy older machines sadly)
[05:20:25] <enix> Where-as I'm running a 2013 model i5 and it's still chugging along
[05:22:21] <Work-BWMerlin> I wonder what AMD's offering are like
[05:22:36] <Work-BWMerlin> I do want to put these on a five year warranty so they are set and forget.
[05:22:36] <xe0n> yeah buy intel mate
[05:23:26] <Work-BWMerlin> But also buying heaps of the same makes life easier because then you don't need to worry about "that is the special powerful machine and you get the "slow" machine" when the only difference maybe a little extra RAM for the accounts team
[05:23:45] <xe0n> well yeah
[05:23:53] <xe0n> it's standardisation lol
[05:23:55] <xe0n> normal :P
[05:24:05] <Work-BWMerlin> Wanting to get accounts onto 27" 1440 monitors for Excel, everyone else can have 1080/1200 24"
[05:24:19] <xe0n> and usually when the current model is discontinued, you just automatically roll over to the replacement model
[05:24:38] <xe0n> business class machines are easy to manage like that
[05:24:49] <xe0n> hp\dell will be able to provide roadmaps of all that stuff
[05:24:58] <enix> and if you're ditching a bunch of old dell optiplexes, hmu
[05:25:06] <enix> seriously, i'll buy a bunch of them from you
[05:25:09] <xe0n> LOL!

[06:32:56] <xe0n> lenovo
[06:33:15] <Lvl4Sword> What's wrong with Lenovo outside of that Superfish stuff?
[06:33:19] <xe0n> pain in the ass when dealing with drivers\central management\imaging
[06:33:23] * catbeard pokehs PrincessZoey
[06:33:31] <PrincessZoey> to
[06:33:34] <xe0n> most business class machines from lenovo ive had to do model aliasing and stupid junk
[06:33:35] <PrincessZoey> yo*
[06:33:58] <PrincessZoey> sup catbeard ?
[06:34:02] <xe0n> hp\dell = sccm driver packs, good for any imaging platform, no aliasing required, just standard smarts built into the tools (SCCM, MDT)
[06:34:29] <xe0n> but ay if you can get a good price for bulk purchase, go for it
[06:34:52] <xe0n> but be aware those mini pcs can sometimes run the lower powered chips, U\T, U aint so bad, T errrr ive seen some people struggle with em
[06:35:00] <xe0n> hence the SFF desktops just use standard desktop cpus
[06:35:28] <xe0n> and easier to get parts replaced if need be, again usually with business class you just organise the on-site delviery of the part, engineer can either do it or yourselves
[06:35:36] <xe0n> pretty stock standard stuff
[06:37:29] <csws> yeah the tiny PCs use low power chips
[06:37:34] <csws> lenovo hardware is okay i guess
[06:37:37] <csws> but only because everything else is trash
[06:37:56] <csws> t490s is an abomination
[06:39:00] <misspwn_> so today, intelepeer thought it would be a cute idea to change the way inbound routing works or authenticates
[06:39:07] <xe0n> nice
[06:39:10] <xe0n> keep you busy? :P
[06:39:11] <misspwn_> 10digit dialing did not work inbound
[06:39:20] <misspwn_> yeah i was putting out mad fires this morning 
[06:39:49] <misspwn_> went through adding an * in front of the numbers but it wasn't fixing it because they were changing it back and fourth on their end and reverted it all back
[06:40:04] <xe0n> so intelepeer is telephone?
[06:40:18] <misspwn_> they go "well i wouldn't say we reverted but we made adjustments to our previous changes" yeah it's the main sip trunk provider we use
[06:40:37] <misspwn_> so it would have taken even longer to flip over to the backup failover sip
[06:40:47] <misspwn_> outbound was workin just fine tho
[06:41:18] <misspwn_> how you gona make a global change like that without telling people LOL
[06:41:29] <misspwn_> that's not an oops
[06:41:37] <xe0n> hehe yep
[06:41:45] <misspwn_> so many companies use vOIP
[06:42:42] <misspwn_> shit yeah tomorrow is friday, good riddance to this entire week of mondays

[06:48:50] <signofzeta> really?  It isn't an evolution of the "Meet Now" button?  I know they've tried to make headway with the personal/"Teams for Life" thing.
[06:49:39] <xe0n> it is evolution of meet now pretty much
[06:50:29] <signofzeta> well, I'm sure Microsoft will make you sign in with a MSA and then automatically enable it.  I'm sure it's great.  I'm on Linux, but I'm a heavy Teams user for work.
[06:51:00] <xe0n> teams is big part of the strategy, not just for chat, pretty much the hub you go to for all things - onedrive, chat, calendar, whatever else
[06:51:04] <xe0n> email will be part of teams sooner or later
[06:51:13] <xe0n> considering you can change your out of office in it now, thats the beginning
[06:51:20] <signofzeta> I've always joked that Teams won't be complete until it gains an email client.

[06:52:25] <signofzeta> Now, just make it a native app so we don't have the Electron framework bogging it down.  It's okay on Windows and Linux, but it drags like hell on my (Intel) MacBook.
[06:52:45] <xe0n> yeah well that's the benefit of electron - one codebase across multiple platforms
[06:52:47] <xe0n> hence they use it lol
[06:53:12] <signofzeta> except the Linux build is missing features compared to Windows and macOS.
[06:53:23] <signofzeta> It's like they embraced Electron but somehow missed the point.
[06:53:24] <xe0n> and that could be for a number of reasons lol
[06:53:44] <signofzeta> yeah, I'm sure there are underlying technical reasons, but you'd think Electron/Chromium would solve that.
[06:53:59] <signofzeta> Pretty sure I *still* don't have background blur or options here on Linux.
[06:55:38] <PrincessZoey> so apparently I won;'t be able to run windows 11
[06:55:42] <PrincessZoey> cuz I have a 7th gen intel CPU
[06:55:45] <PrincessZoey> fuck you microsoft
[06:55:58] <signofzeta> What's the problem?  I thought most every 64-bit CPU could do it.
[06:56:14] <PrincessZoey> it requires an 8th gen
[06:56:25] <signofzeta> really?
[06:56:32] <JollyRgrs> signofzeta: as of now, the HW req. for win11 is 8th gen if you have an i3/5/7
[06:56:51] <signofzeta> Well, shit.  I have a Xeon at work, but I'm sure it's a 4th-gen at best, knowing my boss.
[06:56:58] <signofzeta> Is there some instruction set it checks for?
[06:57:21] <xe0n> too early to tell, but yes there must be some specific stuff relating to those cpus, whatever they are

[06:59:36] <PrincessZoey> JollyRgrs: was bonus money and I was told to buy it
[06:59:48] <PrincessZoey> I just didn't have enough regular money at that point in time 
[06:59:59] <mkillebrew> the fuck is the point of living within your means?
[07:00:06] <signofzeta> I fixed the caliper myself.  New exhaust tomorrow.  Should have spent my Biden Bucks on it, but as much as I hate to say it, a broken cell phone prevents me from doing my job.

[09:56:08] <JollyRgrs> unless it is a topic of interest to me... i'm gonna be antsy trying to just tell you "IDC!"

[10:18:26] <DrZak> hmm, so one person has 240 people accessing their calendar
[10:18:31] <xe0n> haha
[10:18:39] <xe0n> how instrusive
[10:18:42] <xe0n> prob should be a shared mailbox :P
[10:19:08] <DrZak> nope
[10:19:14] <DrZak> there's a name there
[10:19:20] <DrZak> 'Wilrid X'
[10:19:20] <DrZak> :D
[10:19:37] <DrZak> and he can't save any permissions on calendar anymore
[10:19:45] <DrZak> i wonder if the idiot is trying to add more
[10:20:20] <DrZak> this permission model in exchange calendar is donkey feces
[10:20:43] <catbeard> lol this chick is doing yoga and mooing
[10:20:46] <DrZak> it breaks fairly often
[10:20:46] <catbeard> on twitch
[10:20:55] <xe0n> DrZak: when done incorrectly, yes
[10:20:56] <xe0n> haha
[10:21:18] <DrZak> how do you incorrectly find a person and assign them permission? :)
[10:21:28] <DrZak> no its breaking inside the mailbox tables somehow
[10:21:56] <DrZak> the only save then is to do movemailbox with -moveoptions SkipFolderACL 
[10:22:00] <DrZak> and then set them from scratch
[10:22:12] <yuken> @Jay-Ros I've been drinking a lot of high calorie, fatty drinks like whole kefir too, thinking of adding whey powder and doing that as a big source of calories.
[10:22:24] <xe0n> we've stopped allowing users to set the perms themselves, if you want to share your calendar out, log a ticket and we can do it from the backend
[10:22:35] *** Quits: bloodninja (~bloodninj@user/bloodninja) (Quit: afk)
[10:22:36] <xe0n> because once you mix delegations at the mailbox level, and then at the calendar, they can conflict

[10:22:50] <xe0n> but yeah sometimes annoying, i get it...
[10:22:55] <DrZak> that is another matter too

[14:19:50] <emestee> xe0n: I sorted it already
[14:19:55] <xe0n> nice
[14:20:14] <emestee> it's either because of rid range change between versions, or samba extended acl plugins change

[15:24:10] <xe0n> well yep that would get expensive per machine, they prob look at it as a write off and can just replace it with a freshy
[15:24:10] <xe0n> lol
[15:24:33] <xe0n> because apple care wouldn't cover them for a completely fucked up machine that some student mistreated lol

[15:25:25] <BWMerlin> Correct, AppleCare+ covers accidents, not abuse or misuse.
[15:25:30] <xe0n> yep
[15:25:34] <xe0n> so thats why they dont pay for it
[15:26:07] <xe0n> cheaper to replace the machine lol than pay a premium up front for insurance that 9\10 wont cover some student treating it like shit lol

[16:03:27] <badsnappa> the entire point is you make the smallest possible changes - you do little and often; and you get fast feedback on negative consequences of those changes allowing you to revert quickly
[16:03:54] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> Yeah how often is it that it happens that way :/
[16:04:06] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> You're talking about smaller tech debt recovery iterations
[16:04:09] <badsnappa> what happens? revert a change?
[16:04:34] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> In my experience it never ends up being maintenance only, every release ends up being something pushed to new features by Product
[16:04:50] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> Which means more bitrot in general
[16:05:12] <badsnappa>   someone is sceptical
[16:05:21] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> Skeptical yes
[16:05:51] <badsnappa> we do Infrastructure as Code; I really want to move out infrastructure to being CD
[16:06:01] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> Most places misuse CI, and CD becomes an enabler to bad decisions
[16:06:30] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> Infrastructure as code is separate from CI
[16:06:36] <badsnappa> there's no way I would want to get back to massive projects where entire platforms are replaced in one massive migration
[16:06:49] <badsnappa> CI/CD is the next logical extension to Infrastructure as Code
[16:07:08] <badsnappa> we do CI/CD in some of our tiers
[16:08:00] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> You software stake needs to be smaller always; use more mature capital pieces (OS/containers) and iterate less, develop less, configure more
[16:08:36] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> But I'm saying most shops should do with maybe a quarterly software refresh
[16:08:46] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> With security patches constant
[16:09:13] <badsnappa> so on some arbitrary date you upgrade a load of software and then it is all broken at once?
[16:09:23] <badsnappa> sounds good
[16:09:31] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> It's just better to user experience to not constantly deal with weird new (usually self-introduced) software bugs and errors
[16:09:52] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> ... do you not have a staging environment
[16:10:17] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> Testing shouldn't happen in live production
[16:10:51] <badsnappa> in terms of desktops, the configuration is held in source control (Desired State Configuration); anybody in the company can change it. There is a process, they add a few machines to the testing configuration, rebuild them and test them. When they are happy, they promote their changes to the stable configuration.
[16:11:24] <badsnappa> we see the bulids go through the same way as changes to our software, so we can look at them and keep an eye on what is changing
[16:11:30] <estranger> big bang migrations don't work, aren't practical..... you need more kafka
[16:11:47] <badsnappa> so generally, if our users want updated software, they do it themselves :)
[16:11:59] <badsnappa> we swing in for the OS upgrades
[16:12:10] <badsnappa> and the accounts team ... well, they're something else
[16:12:31] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> I feel like we're talking past each other because I'm mostly talking about application software
[16:12:41] <badsnappa> machines get automatically re-imaged and rebuilt every two weeks to propogate the changes
[16:12:52] <xe0n> wtf
[16:13:34] <BWMerlin> Interesting, why not WSUS?
[16:13:46] <CptLuxx> because wsus sucks
[16:13:47] <CptLuxx> lol
[16:13:56] <badsnappa> WSUS (a) sucks and (b) only handles updates
[16:14:18] <BWMerlin> Agreed, I rip WSUS out when I find it.  Point to the internet, peer updating is already enabled by default so let it handle it
[16:14:28] <xe0n> lol wtf!
[16:14:50] <sd> 14<K​artel> pffft
[16:14:51] <xe0n> classic
[16:15:14] <badsnappa> we do use WSUS ... but mainly as a means of slipstreaming updates into the install images using DISM
[16:15:15] <estranger> just don't do updates, problem solved
[16:15:26] <badsnappa> speeds up the rebuild time
[16:15:40] <CptLuxx> how much?
[16:15:48] <CptLuxx> its almost only one update..
[16:15:50] <CptLuxx> the last cu
[16:15:50] <CptLuxx> done
[16:15:54] <xe0n> eh depends..
[16:16:11] <badsnappa> our dev machines rebuild in 45 minutes, that includes installing visual studio and all the software they use
[16:16:42] <badsnappa> I think there's another 20 minutes on top of that to checkout the codebase, build, warm up the apps so the freshly rebuilt machine is in a ready to go state
[16:16:44] <BWMerlin> You might like full flash update, should get the time down a bit
[16:16:56] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> I've seen a lot more scenarios where the desired practices don't hold water to reality. Not without in-house developer support to make significant changes to existing code and not without more budget than would make sense for said enterprise
[16:17:40] <badsnappa> FFU looks a bit like golden image?
[16:17:41] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> Tbqh the set of companies where that is the case is much bigger than the agile set
[16:18:25] <BWMerlin> Yes, FFU is a fat image ghost style
[16:18:31] <estranger> I like places that throw money at problems
[16:19:00] <BWMerlin> Build the image using your existing process, capture and then FFU deploy, should save you some time
[16:19:21] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> We manufactured the need for this type of work model ourselves, as an industry
[16:19:36] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> soon may the wellerman come
[16:19:39] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> It isn't free, it has a cost
[16:20:27] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> badsnappa: i'm jjely
[16:20:29] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> *jelly
[16:20:52] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> Its taken me at least a week off and on to get my dev env back up
[16:21:01] <badsnappa> I like DISM/WIM method because you take a stock WIM and slip stream in the updates. If there is an equivalent FFU image that can be updated the same way, without the need to "capture" it, that would be good. I've found some docs, I'll have a read after lunch
[16:21:20] <badsnappa> N.B. the process needs to be fully automatable for us
[16:22:16] <estranger> glad no one reimages my workstation heh
[16:22:27] <badsnappa> p​arismillyteri: tbh there's a lot of unnecessary overhead in traditional enterprise that makes "change" very expensive. I've worked in jobs with multiple change control boards and it is just fucking awful. And for all the oversight, scrutiny, control whatever, things still get fucked up and they get fucked up big.
[16:22:43] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> Yes!
[16:22:45] <estranger> they just give us admin and say later dawg!
[16:22:49] <badsnappa> estranger: why would it matter when after reimage your workstation has all your preferences baked into it?
[16:23:08] <CptLuxx> ALL
[16:23:09] <badsnappa> well that's almost true, you kind of have to agree them with the rest of the team
[16:23:29] <estranger> cus I have a ton of custom stuff installed
[16:23:58] <badsnappa> from a support perspective its great. Most users will reboot their machine, hit F12 and reimage it, 90% of the time curing whatever problem they had
[16:24:20] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> I don't miss traditional enterprise but I do think full agile everything is a sort of overcorrection- the technology is good but it often gets misused (mostly by business types)
[16:24:35] <estranger> very large enterprises need that kind of control and process, else they wouldn't work  .... it's a very large ship to steer., but yes some take it too far and it takes months to make a change
[16:25:00] <estranger> I love working with large enterprises, but never for them
