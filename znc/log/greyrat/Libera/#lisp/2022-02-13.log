[00:35:30] <lisp123> White_Flame: I think the recent release of open genera & VLM is just to support the mac m1, but they haven't changed anything about its nature
[00:35:33] <lisp123> Link?
[00:36:13] <White_Flame> the dude who works on it was talking about it on irc
[00:36:27] <lisp123> I see
[00:36:52] <White_Flame> also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genera_(operating_system)#Releases
[00:37:43] <lisp123> Was the guy "David Schmidt"?
[00:37:53] <White_Flame> no
[00:38:28] <White_Flame> I guess him (link from wikipedia reference) https://twitter.com/gmpalter/status/1359360886415233029
[00:39:37] <lisp123> Thanks
[00:39:50] <lisp123> So looks like he did it buts a private release
[00:40:20] <White_Flame> yes, as I mentioned "open" genera is not open source
[00:40:27] <lisp123> Got it
[00:40:34] <White_Flame> (as many commercial products with that word in the name aren't)
[00:41:13] *** Joins: karlosz (~karlosz@47.151.136.69)
[00:41:15] <lisp123> Yeah
[00:41:41] <White_Flame> if you want to run the "leaked" versions, https://archives.loomcom.com/genera/genera-install.html
[00:41:56] <White_Flame> and there are tons of docs on bitsavers
[00:42:11] <lisp123> Thanks, yeah I saw that
[00:42:28] <White_Flame> I have no idea what the actual ramifications are of the distributed VLM versions; they're openly on github
[00:42:30] <lisp123> I'm spoilt with high res screens now, can't go back to old technology
[00:42:51] <White_Flame> you can run it in whatever res you want, iirc
[00:43:04] <lisp123> I see
[00:43:09] <White_Flame> but the fonts are bitmap & unscaled if you have a high dpi display an poor eyes
[00:43:23] <lisp123> Ah yeah that will be a killer for me
[00:45:57] <lisp123> I wonder who is using Portable Genera 2.0 today
[00:46:16] <lisp123> Some top secret NSA laboratory?
[00:46:36] <White_Flame> some old legacy government stuff
[00:47:01] <White_Flame> they still have like an $80k/yr contract with dks/symbolics
[00:47:16] <White_Flame> and buy replacement hardware of which there's still a cache
[00:47:33] <White_Flame> so I do wonder if that's running down and they needed to run their existing worlds on modern hardware more
[00:47:55] <lisp123> Running on M1 may point to that
[00:48:10] <lisp123> I do wonder what software is running on Genera that couldn't just be ported to CL
[00:48:25] <lisp123> Must be something large?
[00:48:34] <White_Flame> it's object system is different, and there is control over different memory regions & things like that which would have to be rearchitected
[00:48:38] <White_Flame> *its
[00:49:08] <White_Flame> and again, I assume they're running snapshotted worlds, not necessarily just have some source code to recompile
[00:49:22] <White_Flame> certainly they could make a CL layer, but having it "as is" is beneficial for .gov assurances
[00:49:28] <lisp123> "At some point, there will be a free license for non-commercial use of Genera and the emulator. (I’ve seen a draft.) As the emulator now runs on Intel and ARM processors (e.g., Apple Silicon Macs), you won’t have to buy a machine. (I presume that was an Alpha.)"
[00:50:47] <White_Flame> where's that from, twitter?
[00:50:56] <lisp123> Yes
[00:51:00] <lisp123> GMPalter
[00:51:06] <lisp123> Same link you sent
[00:51:22] <lisp123> Now I wonder, if Genera is free, could it become a viable operating system for the future?
[00:52:05] <White_Flame> depends on your definition of "viable" :)
[00:52:14] <White_Flame> but I doubt that it would include source code for all the boot image stuff
[00:52:27] <lisp123> If it can run Safari / Chrome
[00:52:28] <lisp123> lol
[00:52:41] <lisp123> And electron apps
[00:52:46] <lisp123> And Javascript ;)
[00:52:52] <White_Flame> and it doesn't sound like a great idea to have the native OS being a hardware emulator, might as well just do it in userspace anyway
[00:53:20] <lisp123> True

[13:10:15] <SR-71> Did you guys read about the famous Ken Thompson hack?
[13:10:57] <moon-child> yes
[13:12:01] <SR-71> I wonder if that hack is still functional.
[13:12:23] <jackdaniel> if you can modify the compiler then you may make it do anything, but it's not really a hack if you ask me
[13:12:53] <moon-child> functional in what respect?  The implementation he made does not target modern hardware, but it's certainly still possible to make such a hack
[13:12:58] <jackdaniel> the hack would be obtaining the capability to modify the compiler
[13:13:21] <jackdaniel> (in a system where you don't have access to it)
[13:13:40] <jackdaniel> modifying the compiler itself to produce malicious binaries is just a malicious feature
[13:13:48] <SR-71> Clever
[13:14:14] *** Quits: ed (~ed@175.141.150.118) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[13:14:33] <SR-71> I wanted to implement such a hack for real
[13:14:34] <moon-child> I don't think the compiler itself is necessarily the most interesting target.  It's just the one he happened to come up with.  But the point is that you can make a hack which spreads itself and hides itself
[13:14:54] <moon-child> and more broadly that computer systems are sufficiently complicated as to not be ultimately trustable
[13:15:03] <jackdaniel> SR-71: in some common lisps it is possible to modify the CL package after releasing the package lock
[13:15:15] <jackdaniel> then you could modify the defun macro to inject some code at the beginning of a function body
[13:15:23] <SR-71> jackdaniel: Spooky.
[13:15:34] <jackdaniel> voila, all functions defined with defun have that code at the beginning, and that code is further compiled
[13:15:54] <jackdaniel> since defun is a macro, it is technically speaking part of the compiler because it is expanded at the compilation time

[13:17:26] <SR-71> That's why proprietory software is suspicious. 
[13:18:01] <moon-child> point of the thompson hack is that _all_ software is proprietary
[13:18:16] <moon-child> and that you haven't real all of the 10s of millions of lines of source code to your opensource software anyway
[13:19:06] <SR-71> I wonder if our nearest pet shop has pigeons. 
[13:20:05] <SR-71> Training them should not be more difficult than inspecting thousands of lines of code.
[13:20:19] <jackdaniel> I think that you've used the term "proprietary" with a different meaning than its definition
[13:20:19] <SR-71> Aye?
[13:22:36] *** Quits: xiews (~wxie@101.93.17.62) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[13:23:34] <SR-71> Proprietary = some level of concealment
[13:25:33] <jackdaniel> not really, proprietary means that some rights are reserved to the publisher (or the software owner) - i.e about sharing modifications
[13:25:53] <SR-71> limited rw access.
[13:26:22] <jackdaniel> the term is not very specific and I believe that one could argue that free software is also proprietary, but the usual line is drawn based on what rights the software user have

[13:27:20] <SR-71> I usually go by if you can read it, modify it and publish it it's not proprietary.
[13:27:32] <jackdaniel> either way proprietary is about having right to do something, not about a technical capability of doing it (indeed it would be hard to review bigger codebases singlehandedly)
