[00:33:52] <Koopz> so i got this simple bash script that generates a .env file containing a db user and password which is being used by docker to communicate the credentials with the db and a php API in two different containers. Now i've added console commands for maintenance tasks to the PHP project and am wondering how i'm supposed to pass the credentials there
[00:34:33] *** Quits: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[00:34:38] <TML> where do the maintenance tasks run?
[00:34:58] *** rake is now known as anomander
[00:36:35] <Koopz> i run those tasks by SSHing to the host, going to the folder containing the project and doing a 'docker run --rm -it -v .... php:latest php cli.php app:import' so it's completely outside of the docker-compose stack
[00:36:53] <Koopz> which sounds utterly stupid
[00:37:38] <Koopz> kinda wish docker-compose.yml had a 'scripts' section like the composer.json

[00:43:16] <Koopz> is my approach wrong? should i go to the folder containing the docker-compose.yml and do a 'docker compose exec app php cli.php app:import'?
[00:48:43] <biberu> Koopz: i assume cli.php should be used every time? should be enough to just compose run service app:import, without repeating php script.php on each invocation
[00:49:28] <ramblebamble> Koopz, your approach has some advantages to other approaches and vice versa, however compose is not to be used for prod-serves for that use swarm/stack(never used those) but since they are deprecated I would use kubernetes and there you have jobs,
[00:49:52] <biberu> Koopz: you can have multiple compose files too, if you want to keep those services outside of a main one for some reason?
[00:49:53] <Koopz> well the default entrypoint for the service is 'php server.php' which fires up an API using ReactPHP
[00:49:56] <ramblebamble> you could also run everything using docker-exec, but since your application runs inside a dockerized environment, it makes sense to use that environment for the cli-command
[00:51:03] <biberu> Koopz: note that you can override entrypoint and command in a service description

[01:26:23] <Koopz> regarding the php container itself, doesn't it kinda bug you that you basically always end up having to create a Dockerfile for extensions?
[01:26:49] <ramblebamble> What do you mean creating a docerfile for extensions?
[01:27:27] <Koopz> well suppose you want to have pdo_mysql, the "official" php image doesn't ship with it by default
[01:28:24] <ramblebamble> Koopz so what that is why you build your own images, I even run my own registry where I build images some based on official images some from scratch, and if you have build it it is already present locally
[01:28:47] <ramblebamble> That is the whole point of docker
[01:28:57] <Koopz> building my own images?
[01:29:22] <ramblebamble> minimal environment for your application, less attack surface, no entanglement
[01:29:35] <ramblebamble> Yes, That is what you use your Dockerfile for
[01:30:03] <ramblebamble> docker build . -f Dockerfile -t my_customized_php_image_with_extensions
[01:30:15] <ramblebamble> will show up in docker images
[01:30:18] <Koopz> well yeah, obviously... i don't know about any other languages but i kinda doubt that you have to create custom images for idk, a python application

[01:30:28] <ramblebamble> Yes
[01:30:41] <ramblebamble> pip anaconda(although that gets quite big) and others
[01:30:50] <Koopz> you just use the default python base image and use your python package manager to get the dependencies
[01:31:26] <Koopz> well unless you want to bake the vendor packages into your image as well
[01:31:46] <ramblebamble> either that or build my own from a base-image depending on how I feel/what the project requires, and for native-code you can even do a from-scratch if you statically link it
[01:31:51] <chazy> if i have a autoincrement column for defining a type, can i use an enum for data related to each of these numbers/types? or do i need a key => value array?
[01:32:28] <chazy> like, does the case whatever = 'data' function similar to key => value in an array?
[01:33:05] <ramblebamble> Koopz, different schools of thought, one says it is but a runtime all else comes from the project and we move the code into the project via volumes others say the image is an artifact of the build-process and put everything in, just unpack dunno nextcloud and have a look at what they have inside the image

[01:39:17] <chazy> ramblebamble: i'm reading the docs, but i don't seen an example in there, basically i have a Model->type column which is int and i need to create some sort of list to enumerate the different types and their values, but can i access the value with the type, like with a normal key => value array? or should i just define a normal array?
[01:39:31] *** Quits: guido_ (~weechat@host-79-56-253-217.retail.telecomitalia.it) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[01:40:07] <chazy> i'm currently using constants, but half the name for each type is the same...
[01:40:32] <chazy> actually, 80% of the name of all constants is the same
[01:40:54] <ramblebamble> why would you give a model a type instead of having the model be the type, also when say you need value, type combinations, that is acombinatory nightmare use validation-functionality for that
[01:41:12] <ramblebamble> if 80% is the same why have them in the first place?
[01:41:30] <chazy> i need the data somewhere, should i just create another table?
[01:42:03] <chazy> it's not something that'd need to change, at least not from a dashboard
[01:42:49] <ramblebamble> you have a table, with columns one of them is a type,  and you have a PHP-object representing that table? So, why not make a validation-function testing all thecombinations in code instead of mapping that to enums?
[01:43:34] <ebernhardson> any convenient way to breakpoint (xdebug) any time a builtin function is called? In particular i'm trying to track down what is calling ini_set('display_errors', 1). The errors stop being displayed if i disable the ini_set function, but seems a bit brute force.
[01:44:23] *** Joins: BadAdviceCat (~BadAdvice@user/badadvicecat)
[01:44:32] <Sammitch> `grep -r ini_set`?
[01:44:42] <ebernhardson> Sammitch: wow, why didn't i think of that :P
[01:44:47] <Sammitch> indeed
[01:44:54] <ebernhardson> Sammitch: seems sarcasm all arond :P
[01:45:48] <Sammitch> but why _can't_ you just grep it? going all the way into the debugger for this seems a bit of overkill
[01:46:26] <ebernhardson> Sammitch: i've been grepping for it with no luck.  The project is ~1.6M lines of php
[01:47:29] <ebernhardson> similarly i thought banning the function would cause php to give me a warning or some such when something calls ini_set, and it does ! But i stripped out all ini_set call's that trigger a warning, and somehow display_errors is still being turned on
[01:48:15] <chazy> ramblebamble: i already have a switch, using constants (first_type, second_type, etc...) in the cases and assigning the different constants (first_type_data, second_type_data, etc) to the same variable, i want to rework all that constant nightmare
[01:48:23] <ebernhardson> so something that seemed simpler was, how about i just get a breakpoint every time the function is called with a specific parameter? Sound sway easier than all this mess so far. But it's also not easier :P

[01:54:55] <ramblebamble> chazy, that only manages the complexity, I would argue that a better architecture of that part of the project is more beneficial
[01:55:46] <ramblebamble> chazy have a look at the strategy-pattern
[01:56:07] <chazy> ramblebamble: yeah, i was also thinking of an array instead of a switch, but still i'd need 3 constants and 1 array instead of 6 constants, which is an improvement already

[11:26:36] <dw1> is there a way to inject a new key=>value in a specific position of an existing associative array
[11:27:26] <dw1> or do i just have to create a temporary array and append it at the right time
[11:29:34] <dw1> i guess the latter.
[11:30:38] <biberu> dw1: why is the order important?
[11:31:08] <dw1> woocommerce My Account page menu items are in the order of an associative array
[11:31:19] <biberu> ew
[11:31:21] <dw1> :D
[11:32:41] <biberu> dw1: i think you can use array_splice to insert items

[11:38:38] <fsoc> Is there a way I can serve a video file through video stream in PHP?

It's for using CSRF token to prevent my video file from getting ripped off.
[11:39:02] <fsoc> I don't know how I could do that, if at all.

[14:12:19] <biberu> that's why i wanted him to try with 3 and 1

[20:36:13] <freeman_h> https://3v4l.org/UA6G1
[20:36:30] <Naktibalda> it is simply bad code
[20:36:47] <freeman_h> if in a curl this will be a json object but it will be invalid which is fine
[20:36:50] <Naktibalda> don't mix business logic with output
[20:36:59] <freeman_h> Naktibalda, +1
[20:37:09] <freeman_h> issue i am having is that locally this works
[20:37:17] <freeman_h> but on server json is invalid
[20:37:31] <freeman_h> I cannot see what is different from my local set up
[20:37:43] <freeman_h> am using pre-set up php vm box
[20:37:48] <Naktibalda> so you have output buffering turned on in your local configuration
[20:37:51] <da_wunder> so debug that json on that server
[20:38:43] <noord> blind guess, headers?
[20:42:17] <freeman_h> Naktibalda, is that why it works locally because output buffering is turn on?
[20:42:25] <freeman_h> so the echo does not show?
[20:42:42] <Naktibalda> yes
[20:42:55] <freeman_h> but which buffering?
[20:43:06] <freeman_h> ob_start?
[20:43:21] <freeman_h> or is this in the php.ini
[20:43:35] <Naktibalda> https://www.php.net/manual/en/outcontrol.configuration.php#ini.output-buffering
[20:44:11] <Naktibalda> removing echo is the best fix

[23:14:43] <__adrian> well, for starters, wsl2 *is* a vm
[23:14:54] <__adrian> or rather, a collection of them
[23:16:00] <jhave> Yes with a custom kernel from MS :)
[23:16:18] <__adrian> i don't use windows, but i hear the better way to mount is to mount a directory on your wsl2 machine and then use wsl:\\ from windows to access. but take that with a grain of salt; someone else might be able to give a better answer.
