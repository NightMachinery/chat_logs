[02:07:39] <ecdhe> lunaphyte: I've been working on an imap-interposer
[02:09:51] <ecdhe> the goal is to give a whitelist-filtered view of your inbox transparently over imap/s.  So it will present an imap server which accepts your credentials and passes them through it's own imap client which is connected to the server where your email is stored.
[02:12:31] <ecdhe> Once a connection + session is established the interposer will pass your commands as usual, but it will filter the server responses to show you only emails from senders on your whitelist.

[20:49:13] <ecdhe> is there a good place to find packet captures of various IMAP clients talking to servers?  Wireshark's wiki has a pcap of a mutt session.  But I'd love to get captures of outlook, thunderbird, etc.  I'm trying to get a feel of typical client behavior
