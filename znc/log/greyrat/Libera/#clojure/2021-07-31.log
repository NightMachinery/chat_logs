[17:31:20] <sobel> i don't benchmark much these days. i'd just get absurd numbers indicating my hardware is a million or a billion times overkill. or as i've noted, perhaps more.

[19:50:07] <Para> sobel: we used to serve 1600 reqs/s on a simple medium-ish AWS instance back in 2012 back when I worked in analytics and in some informal events where we talked with our competition they always had a double take and tried to ask that surely you mean per minute or something.
[19:50:38] <Para> Apparently our competition was running at like 35r/s at the time. I really don't understand how, but our OPEX was ridiculously low.
[19:51:41] <Para> This was the data receiving service, to be specific. Incoming protobuf, convert to objects, validate to get rid of worst trash, reserialize to JSON, write out to Kafka.
[19:53:21] <Para> oh and all requests were actually validated with something that these days would be like jwt+oauth2 but that didn't exist back then... :)
