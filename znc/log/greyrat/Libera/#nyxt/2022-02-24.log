[12:23:26] <graf_blutwurst> Good morning. I tried to give nyxt another whirl as i do every couple months. But still my setup is a bit special being on nixos & nvidia. In particular nyxt crashes with `ERROR **: 09:32:44.128: Unable to configure xdg-desktop-portal access in the WebKit sandbox: GApplication is required.`
[12:26:03] <graf_blutwurst> which does not seem to be related to `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1` as my nvidia issues before

[12:59:21] <sochotnicky> graf_blutwurst: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/158005 I guess
[13:17:45] <aartaka> graf_blutwurst: The short answer would be: use `WEBKIT_FORCE_SANDBOX=0`.

[14:02:00] <hsanjuan[m]> what is the process to enable blocker mode by default and have a good list of blocked domains behind?
[14:08:16] <aartaka> hsanjuan[m]: to enable blocker-mode by default, simply do something like `(define-configuration web-buffer ((default-modes (append '(blocker-mode) %slot-default%))))`. Having reasonable hostlists is a bit more complicated. We use the biggest non-AdBlockPlus-syntax hostlist out there, but it seems to be inferior to what e.g. uBlock does. The best hack there would be using uBlock lists and preprocessing them into plain hostlists.
[14:09:09] <graf_blutwurst> Ah thanks! didn't see that one
[14:12:10] <hsanjuan[m]> aartaka: thanks aartaka . Do I need `(in-package :nyxt-user)` in my init.lisp ?
[14:12:43] <aartaka> hsanjuan[m]: It's optional, but highly encouraged :)

[21:00:53] <aadcg> this is a day I never thought I'd live as a european...
[21:32:33] <mariari> hmm nyxt seems to have annoying behavior in the minibuffer with certain types of different language input methods
[21:32:41] <mariari> and focus is also an issue, maybe I need to update nyxt atgain

[22:47:16] <mariari> it's some chinese input methods
[22:47:21] <mariari> mainly Rime
[22:47:33] <mariari> https://rime.im/
[22:47:39] <mariari> but in general the focus is wrong as well
[22:48:07] <mariari> if you have a text box, and you are going to a minibuffer to switch, then fcitx focuses on the browser box and not the minibuffer
[22:49:36] <mariari> namely as you press enter to force it to materialize
