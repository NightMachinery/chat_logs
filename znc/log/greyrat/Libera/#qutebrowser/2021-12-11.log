[02:07:31] <Maxxxed69> To whomever is to read this, and is well versed in the technologies discussed in this channel, that being of the qutebrowser. Are you aware of weather it'd be considered safe to delete the webengine folder from the ~/.local/share/qutebrowser/ folder?
[02:07:47] <The-Compiler> Maxxxed69: define safe
[02:08:21] <Maxxxed69> Would it affect the config.py and other bindings? 
[02:08:21] <topcat001> Maxxxed69: I found it logs you out of websites. Nothing broke otherwise.
[02:08:36] <Maxxxed69> Because it is 2gbs right now
[02:08:43] <Maxxxed69> That, to me, seems like a lot.
[02:09:28] <Maxxxed69> I also am only using a 80gb ssd, so that may also be a reason to it being considered allot by me.
[02:09:30] <topcat001> It is also safe to remove ~/.cache/qutebrowser
[02:10:07] <The-Compiler> Maxxxed69: there is no config in there, but whatever data websites store, for example
[02:11:13] <topcat001> So, removing ~/.local/share/qutebrowser/webengine and ~/.cache/qutebrowser did not break anything in my tests.
[02:11:44] <The-Compiler> Well, it won't break anything, but you'll lose some state
[02:14:10] <topcat001> yes indeed, in particular the login status. The cache folder is still okay to remove though and keeps state.
[02:14:37] <topcat001> but QB has a cache setting as well
[02:14:52] <Maxxxed69> I will figure out a way to stop cahcing my login state and hopefully also figure a way out to automatically request or add to my keepassxc.
[02:15:23] <The-Compiler> The cache folder doesn't store any state (i.e. you can delete it and only see a performance impact)
[02:15:32] <topcat001> content.cache.size
[02:16:55] <topcat001> Maxxxed69: This is a bit out there but you could also run QB with the -B (basedir) option from a tmpfs based folder. All state is then reset on reboot.
[02:18:07] <topcat001> Kind of in between incognito and permanent - very loosely speaking.
[02:18:51] *** Quits: mohab (~mohab@45.243.59.56) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[02:19:02] <topcat001> I love the -B option and how well it is respected.
[02:19:30] <topcat001> It completely contains the browser artefacts.
[02:28:13] <Maxxxed69> topcat001: how would one go around doing that?
[02:36:17] <Maxxxed69> do i put it into my config.py
[02:36:19] <Maxxxed69> topcat001: .
[02:50:59] <Maxxxed69> The-Compiler: actually, is that possible? or is it required to be input on launch?
[02:51:29] <The-Compiler> Maxxxed69: on launch, as it also changes where your config is read from
[02:51:51] <Maxxxed69> So, it isn't supported to just toss it into the config.py?

[03:56:06] <topcat001> Maxxxed69: If you want to preserve the baseline session, say then you can keep it around as a .tar.xz and just unzip to say /tmp and then point QB to that with -B.
[03:57:10] <topcat001> You can prepare the baseline session by starting with and empty folder, set up stuff, quit QB, delete the cache, and then zip it up.
[03:57:16] <topcat001> For example.
[03:58:26] <topcat001> All this does not touch the state in your ~ which you can access by starting qb normally.
[03:59:44] <topcat001> Incidentally firefox can be run in exactly the same way also.
[04:01:03] <Maxxxed69> really?
[04:01:13] <Maxxxed69> I mean, I am currently using tridactly
[04:01:15] <topcat001> I recently had ff glitch on me on Arch because they have enabled EGL by default and I was using this setup to test various things without messing up my ~ profile while still having temporary persistence.
[04:01:16] <Maxxxed69> tridactyl
[04:02:28] <topcat001> Maxxxed69: mkdir -p /tmp/firefox-ramdisk-profile && firefox -profile /tmp/firefox-ramdisk-profile -no-remote -new-instance
[04:02:43] <Maxxxed69> ahh
[04:02:55] <topcat001> mkdir -p /tmp/qutebrowser-base && DICTIONARY="en-GB" qutebrowser -B /tmp/qutebrowser-base
[04:03:04] <noex> can confirm disabling dark mode fixes bad page rendering. not sure if it's my config specifically or the dark mode itself.
[04:03:36] <topcat001> on Arch /tmp is tmpfs
[04:08:52] <topcat001> Maxxxed69: you can just set up aliases for those. That way you can switch modes easily.
[04:09:10] <Maxxxed69> That is cool
