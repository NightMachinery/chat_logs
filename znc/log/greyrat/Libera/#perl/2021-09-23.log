[00:15:40] <lopid> you could compare @INC in both cases
[00:15:42] <yuesbeez> I dont know what you mean. I am running it like perl -d script.pl
[00:16:12] <jaytee80> You could always change it to "use Net::OpenSSSSSH;" and run it without -d. It'll print out an @INC list. Compare that to the one you got earlier.
[00:16:39] <lopid> that's one way to do it

[00:17:06] <yuesbeez> I had this issue before but unfortunately didn't document the fix. It involved running a command before the perl command to manually include the module
[00:17:23] <lopid> PERL5LIB=… ?
[00:21:30] <yuesbeez> The module exists at: /Users/admin/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.20.0/lib/site_perl/5.20.0/Net/OpenSSH.pm
[00:21:39] <yuesbeez> how can I include the admin perl module folder in INC?
[00:21:58] <lopid> perlbrew? are you running it under a different perl?
[00:22:25] <yuesbeez> no I hardcoded the perl binary and still get the error
[00:22:46] <lopid> what do you mean?
[00:22:47] <jaytee80> use lib ' /Users/admin/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.20.0/lib/site_perl/5.20.0'; (probably)
[00:23:06] <jaytee80> It
[00:23:11] <lopid> perlbrew use 5.20.0 && perl -d script.pl
[00:23:18] <jaytee80> It's not exactly recommended.
[00:23:43] <yuesbeez> This fixed it actually: export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:/Users/admin/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.20.0/lib/site_perl/5.20.0/
[00:23:47] <yuesbeez> Thanks for leading me in the right direction
[00:24:12] <lopid> it may have been the right direction but it's the wrong destination
[00:24:59] <jaytee80> listen to lopid. You need to figure out why it's installed in your 5.20 tree and not your 5.16 tree.
[00:25:21] <jaytee80> Or why perl -d is using your 5.16 tree
[00:25:45] <lopid> i think they've just switched envs with perlbrew
[00:25:45] <yuesbeez> Under normal circumstances I totally agree with you, however this is an 8 year old production system and I have been instructed to fix whats broken modifying as little as possible

[04:00:55] <mst> yuesbeez: remember you fucked around and tried to make perl load modules from more than one perl even though we told you not to?
[04:01:08] <mst> yuesbeez: the most likely fix is to undo whatever you did that we told you not to do

[04:03:38] <genio> stupid Apple and their breaking of Perl
[04:04:07] <mst> yuesbeez: shame you ignored all my help and destroyed the server, but now you have to restore from backup
[04:04:46] <jaggz> is sudo cpan safe?

[04:04:53] <mst> jaggz: no.
[04:05:18] <mst> jaggz: running random shit as root is never safe.
[04:06:01] <jaggz> yuesbeez, yuck. you might want to remove all your perl stuff (risking breaking your system scripts), and re-install all the perl packages you have installed
[04:06:06] <jaggz> WITH some preparation 
[04:06:10] <mst> yuesbeez: I specifcally told you to use 'cpanm' only with the -l option *precisely* to avoid this happening.
[04:06:21] <mst> yuesbeez: you ignored my advice. now you are fucked.
[04:06:54] <jaggz> you can do it safer, by reinstalling your perl modules, getting lists of their files, then a list of the files in the system perl dirs, then doing a diff between the two lists so you can remove only stuff that doesn't belong
[04:07:00] <mst> yuesbeez: the moment you ran 'sudo cpan' you basically decided to say 'fuck you mst' and now you have to restore from backup.
[04:07:14] <zgu> i mean ideally it will write everything to /usr/local so you can possibly work out what didn't come from an OS package
[04:07:43] <jaggz> that seems nice too
[04:07:50] <Harzilein> doesn't the local.pod include timestamps?
[04:08:02] <mst> Harzilein: perllocal is bullshit
[04:08:03] <Harzilein> (or whatever its name was)
[04:08:08] <Grinnz> don't assume siteperl is in /usr/local, but you can purge siteperl to undo that, assuming you can find it on whatever kind of install that is, which we can't know since we havent seen the perl -V

[07:26:13] * ology perks up
[07:28:23] <mns> I'm trying to build perl from source and I give Configure a -Dprefix=/path/to/install  All derived variables are set /path/to/install except for scriptdir which is set to /usr/local/scripts.  Why does it do that ? I could force it to /path/to/install but I've never had to do that before.

[07:43:34] <xenu> mns: perl's Configure loves stabbing its users in the back
[07:43:49] <xenu> this is by design, you need -Dscriptdir=/foo if you want to override it
[07:45:28] <Grinnz> yeah, perl-build overrides scriptdir to $prefix/bin
[07:45:39] <Grinnz> alternatively, just use perl-build, it does everything right already
[07:45:52] <Grinnz> https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Build
[07:45:54] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Perl::Build - perl builder - metacpan.org ]
[07:46:51] <mns> xenu: I know that when I have built it in the past, the scripts have been in /path/to/install/bin  without me specifying scriptdir explicitly.  strange that this is happening now.  Grinnz I'll have to look into perl-build
[07:47:32] <Grinnz> as long as there is a perl available to run it with, you can download and use the fatpacked version anywhere
[07:47:33] <xenu> mns: probably because /usr/local/scripts didn't exist in your system at the time
[07:49:18] *** Joins: Linux77 (~Linux7_7@186.233.182.243)
[07:52:55] <mns> we have /usr/local/scripts existing on all our boxes.  our systems group uses that for patching the os, updating firmware, etc.  I've been building on the same host for the whole day and just noticed this.  oh well.  anyway for now -Dscriptdir does the job so that's that.  
[07:54:23] <mns> Grinnz: perl-build seems nice, but the "THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT RELEASE" part makes me less inclined to use it.  
[07:54:51] <Grinnz> don't worry about that, it's nonsense
[07:55:13] <mns> oh 
[07:55:18] <mns> ok good to kno
[07:55:23] <Grinnz> perl-build hasn't been a development release for years and has been used to build countless perls
[07:55:59] <Grinnz> it is a fork of the configure+build code from perlbrew, and is used for plenv
[07:56:42] <mns> whats plenv ?  
[07:56:59] <Grinnz> perlbrew but using the shell rather than perl
[07:57:05] <Grinnz> for switching installations
[07:57:11] <mns> ahh 
[07:57:16] <mns> like python venv
[07:57:29] <Grinnz> more like pyenv as i understand it
[07:57:42] <Grinnz> but i have no idea how the python things work
[07:58:12] <rindolf> ology: ff on debian won't play the sound on soundcloud
[07:58:21] <mns> I have some rudimentry idea, not much.  enough to cause havoc :-)
[07:59:01] <Grinnz> anyway, perlbrew and plenv are both designed for having multiple perls in your homedir, so if you have that specific usecase they're worth looking into, otherwise just perl-build to where you want and set up your PATH how you want
[07:59:54] <mns> yeah seems like perl-build would probably be what I want

[12:51:47] <lustiger_seth> i thought that this was the main reason of a trial.
[12:59:03] <haarg> version numbers are cheap, and always increasing it, even for trial releases, means you can always tell what was installed even if a user installed a trial version
[12:59:25] <haarg> but not increasing it shouldn't be a problem as far as installing it
[13:01:09] <haarg> it's possible they are using an out of date mirror

[18:05:46] <_73> How can I figure out the number of options that have been set with Getopt::Long? Some of my options take one or more arguments. I want to make sure that the user uses exactly 1 option.
[18:08:35] <Altreus> put them in a hash
[18:08:53] <Altreus> it's generally my preferred method to use Getopt::Long these days
[18:09:06] <Altreus> GetOptions( \my %options, spec, spec ... )

[18:16:58] <_73> my program is more like a unification of a few sub programs. And the user should only use one sub program at a time.
[18:17:28] <_73> versus your example which is a program that can can do one thing in different ways
[18:17:34] <Altreus> ah, then I recommend not using options in the first place
[18:17:54] <Altreus> myscript --option1 --option2 subcommand --subcommand-option

[18:23:15] <Altreus> yeah you can even just have a despatch table

[18:23:54] <aquanight> ... I mean that's pretty much what I just said except the "despatch table" is %main::
[18:24:00] <Altreus> GetOptions is a bit zealous though - you need it to only swallow up to the first non-option thing, so you can have a different option spec for the command itself

[23:34:46] <genio> very rarely, if ever, will you need to actually touch typeglobs yourself
[23:34:51] <phryk> choroba: am i right in assuming &$passed_func creates a (shallow) copy? that way someone in here said it works for hashes, so I assume it's similar for functions.
[23:35:17] <phryk> and is $passed_func->() the right way of calling the function *without* copying it?
[23:35:27] <choroba> No. A subroutine has no inner structure, so there's nothing like a "shallow copy"
[23:35:58] <choroba> the two syntaxes are equivalent, but using & is problematic in other contexts, so it's better not to use it
[23:37:18] <phryk> choroba: what other contexts? do you have a link or something? :3

[23:40:48] <_73> phryk: I would reccomend reading the first two chapters of Object Oriented Perl by Damian Conway. It is about basic to intermediate perl concepts and is written in an intuitive fashion unlike some of the docs. You also seem interested in using advanced OO features which the book gets into in later chapters.
[23:40:49] <choroba> it's usually called a "stack"
[23:41:37] <choroba> Circumventing prototypes is also something you don't want to do by accident
[23:41:54] <_73> the book is freely available online by the way.
[23:42:31] <phryk> I don't even know what that means. Usually I know prototype used basically interchangably with signature, i.e. function identifier + parameter and return type information…
[23:42:42] <phryk> _73: I can pirate. :)
[23:43:06] <phryk> And if I'm not poor anymore and actually like it, I might even end up buying the thing.
[23:44:06] <phryk> _73: and I would've rather have placed those features/patterns in the functional programming niche, at least that's where I know most of them from.^^
[23:46:07] <phryk> _73: uh, that book is over 20 years old – does it even still hold up?^^
