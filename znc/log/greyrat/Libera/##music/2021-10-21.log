[00:27:36] <LibertyDillo> need to get one of those 'I'm Not From Texas But I Got Here As Fast As I Could' bumper stickers
[00:28:01] <LibertyDillo> free range raised, morlog?
[00:28:38] <morlog> im a native austinite
[00:28:42] <LibertyDillo> kewl
[00:28:45] <morlog> lived all over the state though
[00:29:01] <morlog> been to every state and national park in the state
[00:29:08] <LibertyDillo> wow, nice
[00:29:19] <LibertyDillo> a rather large place
[00:29:21] <morlog> yeah
[00:29:36] <morlog> lost maples was my favorite
[00:30:01] <morlog> big ol gash in the ground full of maple trees in southwest texas
[00:30:07] <morlog> left behind by a glacier
[00:30:12] <LibertyDillo> Last time I rode to McKinney they were asking people to make appointments because of the pandemic
[00:30:21] <morlog> yeah
[00:30:35] <morlog> i havent checked on that recently
[00:30:41] <LibertyDillo> Indiana hill country is like that, where glaciers stopped
[00:30:49] <morlog> the botanical gardens are still asking people to make appointments
[00:31:22] <LibertyDillo> How about the Bullock Museum?
[00:31:32] <morlog> i dont know\
[00:31:41] <LibertyDillo> would really like to check that out sometime
[00:32:59] <LibertyDillo> been to the Johnson museum at the library, cool that they have his presidential limo in there
[00:33:12] <morlog> nice
[00:34:09] <LibertyDillo> ordered one of the power banks, as I was just thinking the other day about the fact that it couldn't be powered by USC chargers
[00:34:43] <morlog> you can get an adapter
[00:34:49] <LibertyDillo> and you're talk of the USB-C charging brought it back to mind
[00:34:54] <morlog> it does have 2 usb a ports
[00:35:15] <LibertyDillo> I've tried it, my Mac won't charge via USB
[00:35:19] <LibertyDillo> only one-way there
[00:35:34] <morlog> you can get adapters to get the usb c port to put out 20v @ 3 amps
[00:36:02] <morlog> how old is your macbook
[00:36:05] <LibertyDillo> well, good to have that big storage capacity in any event
[00:36:12] <morlog> yeah
[00:36:13] <LibertyDillo> 2010 and 2013
[00:36:17] <morlog> ah
[00:36:32] <morlog> yeah, that wont charge over usb c without an adapter
[00:36:46] <LibertyDillo> but yeah I might look into a transformer adapter just in case
[00:36:48] <LibertyDillo> good idea
[00:37:34] <morlog> the inverter thats built in would probably keep your laptops powered about the same amount of time as a usb c charger for them
[00:37:46] <morlog> it doesnt use much power itself
[00:38:08] <morlog> add about 15 to 20 watts of power use on it
[00:38:40] <morlog> all my stuff is usb c now
[00:38:49] <morlog> went that way because of charge times
[00:38:57] <morlog> easier when your on the move
[00:39:45] <LibertyDillo> good to have that AC outlet on the power bank, as you found out for running a light
[00:39:54] <morlog> yeah

[08:13:17] <efex> sure, about Tala
[08:13:32] <murthy> :)
[08:13:57] <murthy> I think tala is beat
[08:14:00] <efex> do you hear lots of it ?
[08:14:02] <murthy> raaga are notes
[08:14:36] <efex> well I think it‚Äôs a bit more than that but I am a music thoery guy too
[08:14:46] <efex> but it is more my area
[08:14:56] <murthy> efex: the 80's and 90's music had those traditional music that used music theory, but the new music is more like freestyling
[08:15:17] <murthy> efex: I know
[08:15:32] <murthy> efex: I mean I know about your career
[08:16:00] <efex> all music can be desribed by music tyeor music theory
[08:16:00] <murthy> efex: I only music mostly from bollywood and few other outside sources
[08:16:44] <efex> ah sure then you wpuld hear western ‚Äúbeat‚Äù vas phrase lenght Tala based stuff
[08:17:06] <murthy> efex: yes. its like all music can be described by music theory but all music is not created according to music theory
[08:17:14] <efex> man my typing stinks
[08:17:28] <murthy> efex: I even have a video shared by xybre why music theory is not needed
[08:17:39] <efex> no music is created to music theory that I am aware of‚Ä¶
[08:17:58] <murthy> oh
[08:18:13] <murthy> idk, people always say this is not correct
[08:18:18] <efex> music theory is an awesome tool, a tonof explanations of how things have worked in the past
[08:18:34] <murthy> yes
[08:19:00] <murthy> but if you ask my opinion, its like a tool
[08:19:04] <efex> and ideally discusses the underlying [hyis of sound that make the game board we have to share
[08:19:10] <efex> yes!!
[08:19:16] <sublim20> is there a scientific basis for music theory
[08:19:24] <efex> it is a tool, exactly. what else would it be?
[08:19:24] <murthy> ya
[08:19:36] <efex> sublim20: sure
[08:19:36] <sublim20> as in, the vibrations of notes and how they interact, and whats 'pleasing' to  the human ear
[08:19:37] <murthy> agreed
[08:19:56] <murthy> ya scientific and also clean math
[08:20:07] <efex> sublim20: look at the overtones of strings and air tubes
[08:20:10] <murthy> although naming could have been better
[08:20:27] <murthy> perfect fifth :D
[08:20:54] <efex> sublim20: notice they have strong resonjances at math multiples of the frequency of the lowest part of the ‚Äúnote"
[08:21:10] <sublim20> where should i notice this
[08:21:34] <efex> overtones. Then note that math has those as multiples, music theory gives those frequencies notes
[08:22:04] <efex> if the lowest frequancy is 55 hz, that ia an A
[08:22:51] <efex> Say it is C.. the freq multiplrs of the when describes as notes are C C G C E G
[08:22:54] <murthy> don't forget lumatones
[08:23:18] <efex> that is amajpr triad out lined in the physics
[08:23:31] <efex> lumatone is not a theory
[08:23:54] <efex> sublim20: have I lost you? if so I will not carry on :-)
[08:24:30] <sublim20> yeah, you can stop now
[08:24:33] <sublim20> im good
[08:24:45] <murthy> efex: oh, I got a clean theory lessons from cale the other day and it was perfect
[08:25:02] <murthy> efex: only in some cases the is issue with last notes
[08:25:29] <efex> mm I( guess you could say as it has a name and has been described then the relationaship of the term to the main body of discussion.
[08:25:41] <efex> fine
[08:25:56] <murthy> efex: are you talking to me or sublim20
[08:26:33] <efex> sublim20: well.. that fact is the basic glue that attaches physics to the way we use frequenceies as notes in music
[08:26:42] <efex> both 
[08:27:14] <efex> that was concluding sublim20 as he had an awesome question so I wanted the response to be clear

[08:28:43] <efex> as to luma tones, fine, then are lots of interesting aspects of theory so I want to clarify and say that ‚Äúlumatines‚Äù like all other ways of describing music, are a part of music theory. fine!

[08:29:32] <murthy> efex: I can understand your sentiments

[08:33:07] <efex> how could theory developed in the west about western music be chastised for not covering other music??
[08:33:36] <efex> murthy: sure.. and theory up to a certain point has tobe that as well

[14:32:11] <edgar-rft> Mozart: there was a time when Salzburg was in Germany
[14:34:39] <Mozart> edgar-rft: the Kingdom of Bavaria, in fact; Germany didn't exist until after it was returned to Austria. Either way, it was outside Mozart's lifetime.
[14:39:14] <edgar-rft> but I know a guy called Mozart who actually lives in Germany :-)

[15:05:02] <edgar-rft> somehow there seem to be way too many Mozarts in this world :-(
[15:09:22] <Mozart> I've never met another one.
[15:09:46] <Mozart> "I like to think I'm pretty unique."
[15:12:01] <voids> there were ten times less poeple on this planet in 1750 than now, and most uneducated, i reckon there should be more than one mozart now...
[15:13:02] <Mozart> I suppose "way too many" could be interpreted as "one is too many".
[15:15:15] <edgar-rft> until now we know at least three
[15:25:48] <Mozart> I will not rest until the world is all Mozarts.
[15:25:54] <Mozart> Every man, woman and child, a Mozart.
