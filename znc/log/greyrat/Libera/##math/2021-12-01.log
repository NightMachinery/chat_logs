[03:10:59] <droid3> Like say we have a 4 player game. I could write 6 distinct payoff matrix for each two players however i dont see this modeling exactly what mixed strategy over all a player should take between the payoff matrice optimal mixed strategies.

[03:13:09] <droid3> tusko you know anything on how to handle this aka the case where the finite zero sum game is more then two player? Because i find it hard to represent as a single matrix
[03:13:47] <droid3> I mean how is n-player n>2 normally handled for payoff matrices or is there a completely new theory /method to handle n>2?

[03:15:34] *** Joins: bitdex (~bitdex@gateway/tor-sasl/bitdex)
[03:16:12] <droid3> what i was thinking is if created a payoff matrix between each 2 players of the 4. I have 6 distinct payoff matrices to deal with. And if i take player 1 point a few for analysis i could some how combined player2,3,4 payoff into one group player(2,3,4) against player 1. And thus reduce it down to a two player game where player 1 plays againt the group player(2,3,4)
[03:16:22] <droid3> Not sure if thats the best way to go about it.
[03:17:25] <tusko> suppose
[03:17:26] <droid3> But it would reduce to a single payoff matrix just the column group player(2,3,4) would have a shit ton of strategies based on all combination of the other matrix strategies as grouped together

[03:18:47] <droid3> Since its a zero sum game it be a win for player 1 is a lose for players 2,3,and 4 so it seems to encapsulate what a 4 player finite zero sum game would be interms of the first player point of view.
[03:19:57] <droid3> And changing the first player to either 2,3,4 and recalculate the group(1,3,4) group(1,2,4) ,...etc would get the other mixed strategy perspective  of any other of the 4 players against the group.
[03:20:38] <droid3> Since its zero sum this works for any n-player n>=2 i imagine. However the amount of columns for the group get big fast.

[03:24:08] <droid3> let me know if you guys have a better theory on how to handle n-player n>2 finite zero sum games. I like to here your reasoning. But to me the only reasonable way to do it is reduce the n-player game to a 2 player game where the second player is a group of players against the first. And just have a column for each possible permutation of each 6 payoff matrix as columns of the group player.

[03:26:29] <tusko> observe that the payoff that some given player gets in a 4-player, zero-sum game is a random variable.
[03:26:37] <droid3> But that similar to how one would determine the regular two player game payoff matrix values its up to opinion in alot of ways. Assuming values are accurate for payoff and combined payoff i think this would be a reasonable solution to solve n-player zero sum finite games.

[03:29:24] <droid3> then the group combined payoff columns strategies length is 4*3*2= 24 strategies for the group player(2,3,4)

[03:37:25] <droid3> I have read thru this great old book by Melvin Dresher called the mathematics of game of strategy theory and application. Well written proofs understandable
[03:38:05] <droid3> But it only covers 2player finite zero sum games and 2player infinite zero sum games.
[03:38:42] <droid3> So i was kind of thinking on how one goes about a theory for n>2 player finite and infinite zero sum games.
[03:39:22] <droid3> And the case of n-player finite zero sum games i thought as that group player idea. Seems the most logical to proceed.
[03:40:55] <droid3> However not sure if there a better theory or method to apply for n-player finite zero sum games. As i said the book only address 2 player with a single payoff matrix. It does go thru obviously both pure strategy games and ones that require a mixed strategy optimal solution.

I just dont think a theory works out so cleanly as the finite zero sum games payoff matrices.

[03:48:04] <droid3> Ya cooperative and nonzero sum based game analysis to me is very difficult to come up with a general theory on how to even model these as a mathematical problem correctly and solve them. Appart for a few special cases like famous problems like prisoners dilema ...etc

[03:49:55] <droid3> Because mose games in the real world are a nonzero sum or cooperative component at least. Most of games for fun /sports obviously are zero-sum. But most time nonzero as a players win isnt always going to hurt another player in the game of life.
[03:50:48] <droid3> At any extent i thought cooperative and nonzero sum games would be a discussion for another night as me myself dont understand enough about them / how to deal with them its a mystery other then a few problems.

[04:58:59] <droid3> And i think i had that correct for the n-player infinite zero sum game case aka
[04:59:00] <droid3> int...int M(x,y,z.....zn) d(f(x))d(g(y))...d(q(zn))
[04:59:07] <droid3> for n>2
[05:00:28] <droid3> And i think i have away to solve n-player finite zero sum games when n>2 by a method of reducing it to a 2-player game with only one payoff matrix
[05:01:02] <droid3> But wasnt sure my method is the best method or traditional method to solve such n-player games n>2. Not many resource i have found explain how
[05:01:31] <droid3> /or even consider many example other then the 2-player games.
[05:01:50] <droid3> So i was just curious on the generalization theory to handle those type of games.
[05:02:27] <droid3> been repeating myself so all leave that question in the queue of things to figure out and move on. To a different topic soon.
[05:02:59] <droid3> But i think i solved it by what approaches i was speaking of to handle the n-player n>2 finite /infinite zero sum games.
[05:03:31] <droid3> At least it seems like a reasonable way to approach generalization to n-players both in the finite and infinite zero sum cases.
[05:04:53] <droid3> Actually generalizing infinite zero sum 2-player to n-player games just seems like a higher dimensional payoff function integrated over more integrals and with more distribution function for each of the n players. Nothing hugely different from the theory of 2-player infinite zero sum games from what i see.
[05:05:12] <droid3> Actually its not much more difficult to compute

[05:06:00] <droid3> And it seems the minimax theory would hold for higher variable continous function just as it does in the two variable continous function case for the 2-player infinite zero sum games.
[05:06:58] *** Joins: _0x1d3 (sid43116@id-43116.tinside.irccloud.com)
[05:07:16] <droid3> So you have the analog to n-players aka if the payoff function is continous you always will have a minimax theory equality holding and thus a solution to the game will exist for n-player infinite zero sum games like it does in the 2 player proof.
[05:08:46] <droid3> Also you have generalization of convex continuous payoff function have a unique solution optimal mixed strategy like it would for the 2-player infinite zero sum game proof of it would run the same just with more variables to handle.
[05:11:58] <droid3> And if you have separable payoff continous function or several variable polynomial payoff function for the two player games the analogy results for n-player games follow as well.
[05:12:51] *** voiceofreason_ is now known as voiceofreason
[05:13:39] <droid3> So it seems rather trivial to generalize an n-player infinite zero sum game from the definitions of 2-player infinite zero sum games. If i am not missing anything. Doesnt seem much more challenging the theory either (though coming up with a payoff function for n-player games even for the case of 2 is the difficult part once you got the function.
[05:14:41] <droid3> All it is , is minmax expect value integral over the player probability function distribution space
[05:15:19] <droid3> So from doing it in the 2-player case go to higher dimension doesnt pose to much different in analysis
[05:16:30] <droid3> Turning to now n-player finite zero sum games that is a different story and i hope my theory/thought on converting it to a 2-player game payoff where one player plays against the group of other players is the way to analysis the problem as talked about it long before in this thread.

[05:23:49] <droid3> Its bothering me to have a few loose ends in the theory (aka not understanding full yet)

[06:51:31] <droid3> Cool so there is a neat theory i can finally understand the missing pieces of game theory. For the cooperative games/ nonzero sum games its broken into 4 types as state above nash , spe , bayesian nash , perfect bayesian based on if the nonzero game /cooperative game is incomplete or complete type.

[06:54:18] <droid3> Makes sense because for noncooperative /nonzero sum games one number from a player point of view doesnt imply the other player is the negative of that player.
[06:55:12] <droid3> Aka its not a zero-sum so it requires an order pair such as (2,-1) for strategy 3 for player 1 and for strategy 5 for player two for example.
[06:55:57] <droid3> or in general (ai,aj) represents the order pair value for the ith row jth column in the payoff matrix
[06:56:28] <droid3> when its zero sum game the ai + aj = 0  hence we can just write a payoff matrix of single elements not order pairs.
[06:56:51] <droid3> And then the theory kind of defaults to Melvin Dresher great book
[06:57:40] <droid3> because his book only covers finite and infinite zero sum game analysis yaaaaa yes i see very very very cool so exciting

[13:25:11] <gulzar> Hi. I have two set of points. A and B in same 3D space.   'A' forms sort of irregular polygons of various shapes and widths but witthin some max height. B is just scattered in same space as A. There can be some space within A due to it's shape , not always though. How to find out which points from B are enclosed in A. The points are already placed folowingg some rules of distances.  'A' may not form a continous enclosed shape, reason:
[13:25:12] <gulzar>  Imagine it like , a crushed plastic water bottle ,slicecd by two planes,  in water tank. I need to figure which water is within the bottle boundaries. If the bottle is sliced by two planes at any location, it gives three combos : a) the cap is within the slice   b) the slice is cutting the bottle in center c) the bottom is within the slice. case b will have two open sides, case a,c will have 1 open sides.  In this cases the
[13:25:13] <gulzar> planeboundary shuould be used to get the enclosing location.  this is why the width of thes polygons can be any but the height is maximum th ehieght of the slice.   I aam not good at text chats, please excuse long msg

[17:42:09] <[itchyjunk]> in my formula sum_0^inf f^(n) (a) / n!  *(z-a)^n, my a is 0? i'm trying to verify i understand this by taking the taylor series of z, i should get back z but i am not
[17:42:46] <[itchyjunk]> f(0) = 0 so my first term is 0. f'(0) = 0..
[17:42:47] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: think about it. If f(z) = c_n z^n + c_(n-1) z^(n-1) + ... + c_1 z + c_0 , you just iteratively differentiate and look at the constant term to see that each  c_j = f^(j)(0) / j!      Taylor series simple come from this anyway, you could say.

My point is that we didn't need to bring in those larger groups (S_n and A_n) really.  Just notice that if s in G is even, then so is any conjugate  x s x^-1   since the x and the x^-1 taken together have an even number of transpositions in any expression as a product of transpositions.

[20:35:48] <Z-module> The upshot is: If G is any group of permutations, and if G contains at least one odd permutation, then the set A = {all even elements of G}  is a subgroup of G having index 2, so it's normal. (By the way, this holds even if G is infinite.) I just find my direct check that A is normal up there to be closer to the heart of the matter.

[21:07:07] <Z-module> cadmio: for that, they *do* need |S_n : A_n| = 2.  In general for any group S with a subgroup (even nonnormal) A having |S : A| = 2, if K is any subgruop of S at all that contains even one element not in A, then  KA = all of S, because:   KA contains all of A plus at least one more thing, and KA is a subgroup of S, so  2 = |S : A| = |S : KA| |KA : A|  and |KA : A| > 1.  So |KA : A| = 2 so |S : KA| = 1 so S = KA.   This works even when
[21:07:07] <Z-module> everything in sight is infinite.
