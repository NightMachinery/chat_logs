[00:14:27] <Nanobot> MC is a hot girl who wants to be a dog. So, she takes her pet lap dog, cuts open its belly, empties its guts, and stuffs herself inside. She's a dog now! She runs over to her cute female kouhai who has a crush on her and begins humping the kouhai's leg. The houkai can tell from the feel of the hump that it's her beloved senpai inside, so she begins sucking on the dog's penis. MC has never experienced pleasured like this before. She works the rest of her 
[00:14:27] <Nanobot> dog body into the kouhai's mouth and down into her stomach. As MC begins to be digested, her dog body climaxes, and the dog DNA mixes with the kouhai's to give her dog ears and a dog tail. The dog body digests to the point where it loses integrity, and MC's human body bursts out, exploding the bodies of the dog and the kouhai. MC is fully satisfied.

[13:54:33] <Sadale> Dunno. I find it fun to edge without cumming
[13:54:34] <MootPoot> I never grocery shop while hungry
[13:54:47] <MootPoot> because if I do...I end up buying junk
[13:55:13] <MootPoot> I'm not sure if anyone else has had a similar experience with food
[13:55:44] <MootPoot> Its a lot easier to give into inhibitions and buy crap food / frozen / quick or processed when you are hungry
[13:56:31] * Sadale doesn't purchase grocerries :(
[13:56:37] * Sadale can't cook >_<
[13:56:44] <MootPoot> how will you be a good househusband for your imouto
[13:56:52] <Sadale> I'll need to learn that.
[13:57:07] <MootPoot> the trick to cooking is ez
[13:57:15] <Sadale> But I can't learn that while my stupid dad's around. He loves to watch people doing shit and make uncomfortable remarks on everything :/
[13:57:38] <MootPoot> 1.) eat what you want from outside so you know what it tastes like 2.) watch video on how its made 3.) try and fail a few times
[13:57:42] <Sadale> Either I wait for his death or I move out. The latter probably happens first.
[13:57:46] <MootPoot> then 4.) you now have food
[13:57:56] <MootPoot> Sadale: I mean, when I get people like that I start commenting on them
[13:57:56] <Sadale> I see. Sounds easy
[13:57:58] <MootPoot> then they stop
[13:58:20] <Sadale> MootPoot, nah. This dude's different. If I start commenting on him he'd yell at me. :/
[13:58:29] <MootPoot> yell back

[13:58:46] <MootPoot> outlast him
[13:58:47] <Sadale> He'll always take the last yell
[13:58:56] <Sadale> basically me and my imouto are tolerating him. This guy's hopeless.
[13:59:10] <MootPoot> one time my dad did that to me, he kept on asking me why I keep my room door closed
[13:59:11] <Sadale> If the rent here wasn't that expensive I'd defo move out
[13:59:15] <MootPoot> asking me "what am I hiding"
[13:59:16] <MootPoot> etc
[13:59:35] <MootPoot> so one day I was talking to him and I followed him into the bathroom as he was about to go take a shit
[13:59:38] <Sadale> MootPoot, Your dad's probably better than mine. Mine's an idiot
[13:59:40] <MootPoot> he asked me to get out
[13:59:49] <MootPoot> I told him you arent doing anything bad so why are you hiding
[13:59:58] <Sadale> MootPoot, mine would knowingly do shit that we told him not to do...
[14:00:16] <Sadale> lol
[14:00:26] <MootPoot> he never annoyed me about my room door again
[14:00:27] <MootPoot> lol
[14:00:30] <Sadale> lol
[14:00:33] <Sadale> lucky you.
[14:00:51] <Sadale> Now that me and my imouto'd stay in our own room and close the door whenever that idiot's around
[14:01:13] <Sadale> At least your dad knows when to compromise.
[14:01:50] <Sadale> damn. It makes me sad. The family I'm in was never functional.

[14:03:06] <Sadale> MootPoot, I mean I could actually move out with my imouto. I do have the money to do that. Of course that'd cost me money. And I'd have to do housekeeping work. Currently it's my cute mon who's doing that
[14:03:17] <Sadale> And it'll affect my retirement plan
[14:03:28] <Sadale> Probably pushing it back for like 5 years

[14:05:52] <Sadale> Not with my dad being around. I can't clean up without having him to notice
[14:05:59] <MootPoot> just do it in the bathroom
[14:06:01] <Sadale> In my room my imouto's here and I can't fap.
[14:06:17] <Sadale> nah. fapping without computer access' boring
[14:06:36] <Sadale> I'd rather to use those fapping assisting software/program.

[15:34:06] <MootPoot> all of them are sold as milk replacements
[15:34:12] <MootPoot> coconut milk too
[15:34:45] <darkwitch> they look much like milk
[15:34:48] <amigojapan> MootPoot: soy milk is older than milk in Japan
[15:35:08] <MootPoot> I'm pretty sure milk existed before the idea of soy milk was even a thing amigo

[15:35:50] <darkwitch> peanut butter spreads like butter? hmmm, maybe the smooth version comes closer, but it behaves and tastes very different than butter
[15:36:26] <amigojapan> MootPoot: milk only started being drank in Japan since the Meiji era
[15:36:31] <MootPoot> but breast milk was a thing way before soy milk

[15:36:46] <MootPoot> :3
[15:36:49] <darkwitch> japan does not have a cheese tradition
[15:37:25] <MootPoot> the idea with replacements is kind of that they fill the same area and do the same thing
[15:37:32] <MootPoot> not that they need to taste 100% the same
[15:37:47] <MootPoot> so if you are vegan and you still want milk and cereal.....

[18:04:06] <MootPoot> Zoidberg: what are you telling amigo now
[18:04:17] * MootPoot just got out of the shower
[18:04:24] <Zoidberg> Amigojapan, it doesn't matter if you believe it or not.
[18:04:26] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: not all of them, for example jellyfish are completely different
[18:04:46] <Zoidberg> I said most of them amigojapan
[18:04:53] <Zoidberg> :p
[18:05:03] <amigojapan> Ok
[18:05:40] <Zoidberg> Read some Richard Dawkins books. You'll understand science.
[18:06:09] <amigojapan> Which book Zoidberg ?I like Richard Dawkins books
[18:06:31] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: I have read many of them
[18:08:53] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: people can read the same book and have different interpretations
[18:09:30] <Zoidberg> I don't remember which one. I read them long time ago amigojapan.
[18:09:41] <Zoidberg> All of them are good in general.
[18:10:09] <Zoidberg> I remember the first one very fondly. The blind watchmaker.
[18:10:11] <amigojapan> Yeah I liked the selfish gene and the blind Watchman
[18:11:36] <amigojapan> Ok guys I am getting sleepy. Oyasumi nasai. Mata ashita ne

[18:49:34] <ButterNoodle> if u delete something with gui file manager
[18:50:26] <Zoidberg> MootPoot: Simple, we used to call everything in ocean as fish. Now with advancing science we simply can't do that. Biologically.

[18:51:55] <Zoidberg> actually the point I was trying to make was don't get stuck up on names, they never mean what they are
[18:52:28] <Zoidberg> not just names as in nouns but even words
[18:52:56] <Zoidberg> Sinister has it's origin as someone who uses left hand
[18:59:34] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, I call myself slave of my imouto :3
[19:00:11] <Zoidberg> hello slave, im zoidberg
[19:00:38] <Nanobot> Cleave means to stick together. Cleave also means to separate.

[19:02:56] * Sadale has just learned a new word from Nanobot today :3
[19:04:19] <Nanobot> Honestly, I don't think I've ever heard anyone actually use the "stick together" definition. When I hear "cleave", I think of a sword cutting something in half.
[19:04:48] <Sadale> I havne't even heard of this word as a non-native speaker
[19:05:09] <Sadale> Probably not the kind of word that I'd come across online. It's a mechanical word.

[19:06:11] <Zoidberg> why even make an anime out of it?
[19:06:11] <Nanobot> Sadale: Some common related words are cleaver (a big knife) and cleavage (boob gap)

[19:07:47] <Sadale> lol
[19:08:23] <Sadale> I actually may know more lewd words in English than in my mother tongue. Anyway when I come across a Chinese lewd word I can often understand that immediately because the words here are quite descriptive.
[19:08:29] <Sadale> At least for the lewd words.
[19:10:38] <Zoidberg> Sadale: I don't what dick is called in my native language
[19:10:52] <Sadale> Zegnat, lol
[19:10:56] <Sadale> Zoidberg, *
[19:11:16] <Zoidberg> it never came up tbh
[19:11:19] <Zoidberg> lol
[19:11:21] <Sadale> LOL
[19:11:27] <Sadale> Not surprising xD
[19:11:41] <MootPoot> Zoidberg: so it was all just about scientific classifications? 
[19:11:41] <Sadale> It isn't the kind of words that you'd use in daily life
[19:11:50] <MootPoot> What was the problem then
[19:12:09] <Sadale> Especially if you don't consume local porn or hire hookers that speak local language.
[19:12:16] <Zoidberg> phyla I think is the term
[19:12:18] <MootPoot> Sadale: jerk Ur pecker 
[19:12:21] <Sadale> or have sex with someone that speaks local language

[19:13:35] <Sadale> There's a few words for talking about dick in Cantonese.
[19:13:44] <MootPoot> Zoidberg: do you cook
[19:14:01] <Sadale> Just like in English. We've got pp, peen, dick, cock, pecker, etc. etc.
[19:14:20] <Zoidberg> Sadale: prostitution is illegal here
[19:14:44] <Sadale> Zoidberg, is that common tho? Just because it isn't legal doesn't mean that they aren't around.
[19:14:45] <Zoidberg> MootPoot: sometimes, yes and I don't cook fish :p
[19:14:53] <Sadale> This kind of shit often make their way into thee market even if made illegal.
[19:15:37] <Zoidberg> Sadale: not sure, I honestly don't know. I think it might be common if one know where to look for.
[19:15:38] <MootPoot> Zoidberg: you just order? 
[19:15:48] <Sadale> ah
[19:16:02] <Zoidberg> MootPoot: my parents live downstairs, I eat with them
[19:16:08] <MootPoot> Ah
[19:17:15] <Zoidberg> Sadale: I bet they are quite risky. There are too many stds here in India.
[19:17:19] <Sadale> To be fair tho I've no idea on how you could even hire a hooker here. I guess I'm a good boy :3
[19:17:43] <Zoidberg> Sadale: hiring a hooker doesn't mean they're bad
[19:17:43] <Sadale> Yeah I'm worried about std as well. Plus I'd like to stay loyal to my cute imouto. So I won't bang anyone else. :3

[22:47:21] <Bco1981> i could save 5 more bytes... htop isn't really needed.
[22:47:37] <MootPoot> you can do it in one line if all you do is call a remote script

[22:47:48] <Bco1981> i don't
[22:48:01] <Bco1981> it's one script i download, and run
