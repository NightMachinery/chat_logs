[00:01:11] <fizzie> (And no, the code isn't affected by endianness, it just operates on the full `unsigned int` value. `0x12345678 >> 8 == 0x00123456` is true irregardless of how the implementation decides to distribute those bits in bytes.)
[00:02:06] <Maxdamantus> endianness is only noticable when reinterpreting bytes as different types.
[00:04:46] <bladerunner1> well thanks everyone :) I'll prolly practice around this a bit, now that I understand it

[02:34:47] <TonyStone> i have a while loop and it doesnt print until the loop copmpletes.  if i change it to a for loop it prints.  what can i do to make sure it prints during while loop?

[02:38:23] <nomagno> on many terminals printing without any newline doesn't take effect until the end of the program
[02:38:29] <nomagno> In others it doesn't work at all
[02:38:44] <TonyStone> so nothing prints during this  while(read(fd, privkey, 32) > 0) {

[02:41:15] <fizzie> nomagno: Should be fine. `struct var` is an incomplete type inside its own definition, but you're still allowed to use it in a context that doesn't require a complete type, and the parameter of a function pointer should be one of those. (C11 6.7.6.3p12: "If the function declarator is not part of a definition of that function, parameters may have incomplete type --")
[02:42:05] <TonyStone> BtbN i am tinkering with code of someone elses github project...  im slowly learning a little bit of C so I am not really familiar with read() yet
[02:42:33] <TonyStone> in this project it does this if((fd=open("/dev/urandom", O_RDONLY|O_NOCTTY)) == -1) {  befor the loop
[02:48:13] <TonyStone> wait i should clarify something.  the while loop DOES print in the terminal... however when I am piping it to my other program i cannot read it UNLESS i change it to the for loop then i can read the pipe in my other program.  if that means anything
[02:51:17] <TonyStone> nomagno sorry just saw your respone.  yes i am terminating with newline in both instances...

[03:03:38] <TonyStone> im gonna start over with the original code from github... to make sure i didnt mess something else up
[03:04:01] <ioxzev1z> 202 continues until 303

[03:10:57] <ioxzev1z> Also on line 3 you reopen urandom for each iteration, most likely not closing the previous fd
[03:11:06] <TonyStone> i know   :(
[03:11:11] <ioxzev1z> Move 3 out of the loop you only need to open the fd once

[03:47:50] <fizzie> Given a function f, a list [a, b, c, d] and an initial accumulator value x, folding from the left would mean computing f(f(f(f(x, a), b), c), d).

[03:48:36] <fizzie> (Or the parameters might be the other way around.)
[03:49:20] <fizzie> You tend to see fold more in languages where higher-order functions are less painful than in C.
[03:51:04] <owensjrw> Am I removing a, b, c, and d?

[03:53:25] <fizzie> It doesn't generally speaking modify the list.
[03:53:32] <fizzie> It just returns the result of folding it.
[03:53:38] <fizzie> ,cc int add(int x, int y) { return x + y; } int foldl(int (*f)(int, int), int acc, int list[], size_t n) { return n == 0 ? acc : foldl(f, f(acc, *list), list+1, n-1); } int list[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, sum = foldl(add, 0, list, sizeof list / sizeof *list); printf("sum = %d", sum); // for example

[03:58:14] <owensjrw> So its a way of performing a function on each item in the list from left to right or right to left? In your example summation of each item.
[04:00:51] <fizzie> Yes, except the function is called with two arguments: the list item, and an accumulator that holds the result of the previous call. So in my example, the `foldl(add, 0, list, 5)` call is equivalent to `add(add(add(add(add(0, list[0]), list[1]), list[2]), list[3]), list[4]);`.

[15:35:50] <sham1> But yeah shortly: map goes through each element of your structure and applies the specified function for each element, producing a new list/array/whatever with the new elements. Fold meanwhile reduces the structure's elements by some binary (usually) function, like for example summing every element. Can also be used to implement things like map and filter and other such things
[15:36:10] <sham1> It's an example of a catamorphism
[15:36:50] <sham1> In C those things tend to be expressed more in the way of just doing raw iteration with for-loops and such

Also note that you can't access any JS objects directly from WASM, you always need a wrapper function. Only arrays, strings & numbers can be passed to WASM, the arrays & strings must be copied if not allocated in WASM to it's memory first, and functions can be imported and exported, but calls to them are limited like this.

[23:43:43] <owensjrw> a couple of mentors (such as you are right now) have stated to me to make sure the programs are opaque which is defined  an opaque data type is a data type whose concrete data structure is not defined in an interface. This enforces information hiding, since its values can only be manipulated by calling subroutines that have access to the missing information.
[23:43:53] <constxd> lack of closures accounts for its presense and weak type system accounts for the fact that it's `void *`'
