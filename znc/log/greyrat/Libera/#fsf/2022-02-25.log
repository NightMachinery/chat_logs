[02:32:04] <Kaiod> <GNUCracker> "GNUser?" <- There is no certain nomenclature about GNU users, usually they are called GNUsers or GNU Users. GNU contributors are called GNU Hackers, more or less like this
[02:32:12] <Kaiod> GNUCracker: Hru?
[02:33:05] <isf> my question is:
[02:33:11] <isf> gnu is a gnu system? e.e
[02:35:17] *** Quits: dot0 (~dot0@user/dot0) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[02:37:54] <Kaiod> isf: GNU is an operating system that is free software, and that's it. It contains GNU packages and so on, so I guess so. Although this gets your head in a knot, because philosophy makes you pull up the meaning and confuses everything haha 
[02:38:14] <isf> dude my question is
[02:38:15] <isf> a joke
[02:38:30] <isf> becouse in english dictionary gnu pronounce like new
[02:38:48] <isf> xd
[02:39:26] <Kaiod> isf: I know, I get the point, I just wasn't going to let you have an answer =P
[02:41:32] <Kaiod> isf: In Brazilian Portuguese I can't speak the way you pronounce it, otherwise it sounds like "GUINU", so I have to speak GE.ENE.U (More or less like this, in English it will be understood in a totally different way).

[07:59:31] <White_Flame> but docs, images, etc related to software if used there
[07:59:32] <isf> i recommend you install a free distro of GNU/Linux nmz
[08:00:03] <nmz> isf: what does that have to do with anything?
[08:00:11] <White_Flame> CC only bothers with the artifact itself, while GPL etc deals with binaries, usage, etc

[21:18:24] <vitali64> the git server is vitali64.duckdns.org
[21:18:28] <labrador> vitali64, I'm not arguing that it isn't io but that people forget
[21:18:45] <vitali64> ok np
[21:18:55] <vitali64> craigt: I can't register for now
[21:18:58] <vitali64> maybe later
[21:19:07] <labrador> The best way to prevent phishing is to bookmark trusted addresses
[21:19:13] <labrador> This way you can't forget
[21:19:14] <vitali64> labrador: no
[21:19:19] <vitali64> it's to look at the url
[21:19:36] <labrador> Nah man its easier to look once and use it forever after
[21:19:44] <craigt> vitali64: We can still review the code base.
[21:19:44] <labrador> Looking everytime is borderline paranoia lol
[21:19:58] <labrador> craigt, do you do something to prevent phishing?
[21:20:02] <labrador> just asking
[21:20:16] <vitali64> craigt: why not: http://vitali64.duckdns.org?p=utils/seen.git <- seen
[21:20:26] <vitali64> craigt: http://vitali64.duckdns.org?p=utils/learn.git <- learn
[21:20:57] <craigt> labrador: Not really. I think I am just always careful what I'm interacting with.
[21:20:57] <vitali64> seen is used @ vitali64.gitlab.io/articles
[21:21:08] <labrador> oh
[21:21:12] <vitali64> learn is used @ librerpi.github.io
[21:22:05] <vitali64> craigt: the codebase is less than 100 lines of code
[21:22:16] <vitali64> making learn/seen very small
[21:22:24] <craigt> labrador: I'm don't use any technology to prevent phishing. I don't think anyway.
[21:22:33] <vitali64> and also easy to study them

[21:24:33] <craigt> vitali64: The issue with a rolling version is that the version could change after a review has been done.

[23:14:23] <craigt> vitali64: What about ? http://vitali64.duckdns.org/cgit/utils/learn.git/tree/?h=v0.1
[23:15:25] <vitali64> craigt: works too
[23:15:40] <vitali64> i might stop using gitweb/cgit and use smth else
[23:17:09] <craigt> [APPROVED] https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Learn ([new entry, license check])
[23:17:12] <vitali64> :D
[23:17:19] <craigt> vitali64: Thank you!
[23:17:42] <vitali64> no, thank YOU :D

[23:18:09] <craigt> vitali64: Now, I would recommend sorting out your FSD account so you can enhance the entries. notes, screenshots, etc.
[23:18:09] <vitali64> I'm proud that it's free software and listed @ the fsd :D
[23:18:15] <vitali64> craigt: ok
[23:18:20] <isf> Veloren can be added?
[23:18:20] <craigt> vitali64: Nice! Good to hear.
[23:18:36] <vitali64> craigt: I never created nonfree software
[23:18:46] <vitali64> always used the gplv3
[23:18:51] <craigt> isf: if it is free software, Veloren can be added.
[23:18:54] <alMalsamo> does https://gnudb.org have any relation to the GNU project?
[23:18:59] <isf> see it craigt: https://github.com/veloren/veloren
[23:19:02] *** Joins: tfisgnag (~tfisgnag@181.199.144.10)
[23:19:13] <vitali64> seen/learn are also VERY EASY to study
[23:19:16] <craigt> vitali64: What are your thoughts about the AGPLv3?
[23:19:17] <ggoes> no
[23:19:29] <vitali64> craigt: i don't know
[23:19:44] <vitali64> Andrew told me that it was superior to the GPLv3
[23:19:53] <vitali64> so I trust them
[23:19:53] <craigt> alMalsamo: Hello there. Welcome to the last 10 minutes of this week's Free Software Directory meeting. Will take a look at gnudb.
[23:20:04] <vitali64> hi ggoes 
[23:20:16] <vitali64> :D
[23:20:16] <Noisytoot> vitali64: It only adds one clause. You should read it.
[23:20:21] <vitali64> Noisytoot: ok
[23:20:22] <craigt> vitali64: If there is any chance that seen and learn might be used over a network, the AGPL would be the better choice.
[23:20:23] <ggoes> hi, happy friday
[23:20:34] <vitali64> ggoes :D
[23:21:00] <alMalsamo> craigt: Oh hmm sorry am I interrupting a meeting?  0_o
[23:21:00] <vitali64> craigt: there's a great chance for them to be used on multiple websites
[23:21:10] <vitali64> currently, 2 websites use seen/learn
[23:21:34] <vitali64> well, 2 websites that i'm aware of
[23:21:43] <vitali64> 1. vitali64.gitlab.io/articles 
[23:21:48] <vitali64> 2. librerpi.github.io
[23:22:24] <vitali64> craigt: I might consider using the AGPLv3
[23:22:39] <craigt> alMalsamo: IMO, I don't think gnudb has any relation to the GNU Project.
[23:22:43] <vitali64> if I can upgrade from the gplv3
[23:23:12] <craigt> alMalsamo: Oh no problem. Not interrupting at all, just letting you know.
[23:24:05] <craigt> vitali64: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html take a look at Section 13.
[23:24:39] <vitali64> ok
[23:24:41] <labrador> why not agpl3+
[23:24:53] <craigt> vitali64: Since you are the sole author and copyright holder, you can change the license to whatever you wish.
[23:25:00] <vitali64> :D
[23:25:03] <labrador> it'll make it easier to upgrade
[23:25:19] <craigt> labrador: or-later is always better. Both of vitali64's programs are already or-later for the GPLv3.
[23:25:27] <vitali64> gotta go! :D
[23:25:32] <craigt> vitali64: Thanks again!
[23:25:39] <vitali64> thank you!
