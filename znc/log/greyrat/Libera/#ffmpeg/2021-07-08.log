[00:03:36] <roxlu> I've created ~5 different h264 files (different profiles, yes/no nals, levels, etc.) but not one that I create can be decodeed with this demo.
[00:04:18] <roxlu> I'm curious if there is a way to see the differences between h264 streams (in capabilities/parameters).
[00:05:59] <furq> https://github.com/aizvorski/h264bitstream/
[00:08:27] <roxlu> furq: yeah thanks, that one is pretty detailed indeed
[00:08:40] <roxlu> should I compare the PPS you think?
[00:10:07] <JEEB> if the same stuff works via FFmpeg, then it is not the bit stream but your custom handling of it
[00:10:51] <JEEB> I know I could just shut up but it just is annoying to look at you trying to whack it from what seems to be the completely wrong side.
[00:11:20] <roxlu> JEEB: I -know- that it's something with the way -the demo- handles it
[00:11:30] <JEEB> like add logging to ff_videotoolbox_h264_start_frame and ff_videotoolbox_h264_decode_slice
[00:11:32] <roxlu> and I have clue which is causing it. I
[00:11:39] <JEEB> regarding the goddamn sizes or so
[00:11:52] <JEEB> then you get some knowledge into what is being fed into VT
[00:12:29] <JEEB> then you should be able to figure it out what sort of buffers are being passed to VT by FFmpeg
[00:12:32] <JEEB> for the same sample
[00:12:54] <JEEB> then if you don't want to utilize FFmpeg utilities just write your own parser that does the same job. job's a gooden
[00:13:11] <roxlu> ok yeah that's right
[00:13:17] <roxlu> i might go that way :)
[00:13:51] <roxlu> i didn't directly want to setup a dev environment, make tweaks etc. if there was another approach with ffmpeg
[00:14:07] <JEEB> you are clearly messing things up on a low level and not utilizing FFmpeg
[00:14:19] <JEEB> thus, the best thing you can do is to go as close as possible to the APIs you are utilizing
[00:14:41] <JEEB> and see how the crap that FFmpeg's VT module is receiving differs from what you are pushing into VT in your app
[00:15:23] <JEEB> I am a dumb monkey sometimes writing code, but this still seems like the most straightforward way to compare when you know that X works, and Y doesn't. you start comparing sizes of buffers, the first N bytes of the buffer etc
[00:17:59] <JEEB> but yea, the VT wrapper seems to be keeping the actual buffers fed to VT in vtctx->bitstream / bitstream_size

[00:18:34] <JEEB> then end_frame I guess eats that by passing it into VT
[00:18:59] <JEEB> yea, see videotoolbox_session_decode_frame for example
[00:19:42] <roxlu> I'll create a dev envorinment and start looking into that, thanks
[00:19:43] <JEEB> creates a sample buffer, then VTDecompressionSessionDecodeFrame (and VTDecompressionSessionWaitForAsynchronousFrames)
[00:20:22] <JEEB> you can just follow the registered functions to ff_h264_videotoolbox_hwaccel (such as start_frame or decode_slice, end_frame)

[01:13:16] <slackbot> is there a filter that would let me output either a jpg or a png based on whether there is transparency in the input?
[01:17:40] <kepstin> no - in the ffmpeg cli tool, the selection of output codec is done independently of any video processing that's performed.
[01:18:12] *** Quits: milkt (~debian@gateway/tor-sasl/milkt) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[01:18:16] <kepstin> if you want to script something with the cli tool, you could use ffprobe on the input file to check the presence of an alpha channel, and then set the ffmpeg output codec as you like.

[02:54:05] <slackbot> wait, even if it opens both outputs but only writes to one based on the input stream?
[02:57:48] <slackbot> I mean, wouldn't there be a tee filter to encode both formats and then afterwards I can check the png to see if there's transparency? It seems like a horrible way to do it but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[02:57:49] <DeHackEd> the cli tool lacks that level of intelligence. you have to make it in the app that calls ffmpeg. we suggest ffprobe which can print machine-readable detailed information
[02:58:29] <DeHackEd> you can have it output two files with different options. not sure how jpeg handles input files with transparency. it might reject them?
[02:59:06] *** Joins: MrZeus (~MrZeus@5.253.206.217)
[02:59:28] <slackbot> for me at least it replaces it with just black or something and semi-transparent/translucent areas look weird
[03:00:32] <slackbot> I should maybe look at ffprobe again. I'm hesitant to use it because I don't want to make another request for the resource if it's remote/over http. But maybe it's not a big deal.

[03:14:48] <furq> slackbot: i would use ffprobe but you can do -i input out.jpg out.png
[03:14:54] <kepstin> fwiw, you can output two images - both png and jpeg - from a single ffmpeg command. seems to work fine
[03:15:39] <furq> the png will be rgba if the input had alpha and rgb24 otherwise
[03:16:36] <furq> you'd need to call ffprobe afterwards to check but if you're really concerned about slow networks then that might make sense
[03:16:38] <kepstin> well, it'll preserve the pixel format of the input if possible, i think? and add a conversion otherwise.
[03:17:07] <kepstin> you could also of course download the remote file to a temporary location as a first step.
[03:17:25] <furq> unless it's a frame from a video or something
[03:17:37] <furq> although you could still do something similar
[03:17:57] <furq> and yeah i forgot pal8 can also have transparency
[03:18:26] <furq> i'm guessing you're not going to see any of the other png pixel formats in the wild but who knows
[03:19:32] *** Joins: milkt (~debian@gateway/tor-sasl/milkt)
[03:23:19] <slackbot> Yeah I don't want to download it because if it's a video then ffmpeg doesn't need the entire thing. And I don't know what parts it needs. I think for some formats or containers the end of the file is required and so I let ffmpeg do whatever range requests it needs for that.

[12:30:37] <danergo> JEEB: I have gone all around, and now it seems I can't defeat this: time to first picture is huge. Stream comes from rtsp (h264), and I need ffmpeg to remux it to fragmented mp4
[12:31:06] <danergo> If I hack the fragments with `frag_custom`, sane players will gone to error
[12:31:28] <danergo> I believe they are hoping to get fragments on keyframes
[12:32:15] <danergo> if I modify the encoder to put a keyframe right into the stream just after someone opens the rtsp, it makes no difference, (=stream will start after 10s)
[12:32:48] <JEEB> it really depends on how much buffering etc the players do (in addition to how you generate the fMP4)
[12:33:05] <danergo> if I modify the encoder to put the first 10 keyframes at every second, stream starts fast, but after 10th keyframe, next will come after 10sec, and then I have a 10s pause in the video
[12:33:06] <JEEB> most players don't default to low latency :P
[12:33:56] <danergo> what I don't really get, is if I put keyframes at 1Hz, stream starts fast->OK. but when chaning back to 10s (the keyframes), why should the stream stop?
[12:34:15] <danergo> it must have enough information of everything, as it was already displayed
[12:34:23] <danergo> displayed correctly*
[12:34:51] <JEEB> well check the buffer state of the player, and what your fragments actually contain?
[12:35:08] <danergo> actually, if I purely open the stream in VLC, it displays immediately even without hacking with the keyframes
[12:35:09] <JEEB> if you check the output section and it's all seemingly fine, you'll have to start debugging your client :P
[12:35:54] <danergo> actually, the problem is, that if I use `frag_keyframe`, the first time when `writeout` is called will be after 10s (except the header ofc)
[12:36:15] <JEEB> well yes, it will wait until you have a GOP done, then push the whole GOP out in a single burst
[12:36:21] <JEEB> I think we have gone through this already?
[12:36:43] <danergo> yes. but then: what I really don't get: how can VLC be so much faster?
[12:36:54] <danergo> it opens the stream immediately

[12:36:59] <JEEB> and that's the rtsp one?
[12:37:08] <JEEB> unless you are talking of the fMP4 mux
[12:38:10] <danergo> rtsp contains h264 stream and as far as I know, it cuts the raw bytes at NAL units
[12:38:38] <JEEB> if you are going to compare things, compare apples to apples, oranges to oranges
[12:38:53] <JEEB> "opening this RTSP source is faster than this fMP4 mux that I do at each keyframe"
[12:39:12] <JEEB> RTSP data (RTP essentially) is an A->B mux
[12:39:20] <JEEB> which can be written out as it goes as far as I can tell
[12:39:47] <JEEB> and at the very least, the code paths for input between the RTSP stream and the HTTP (?) fMP4 streams are completely different
[12:40:04] <JEEB> you can't really compare them 1:1 thinking it's the same stuff. it's not
[12:40:12] <JEEB> plus you should know how your mux is going
[12:40:22] <JEEB> as in, when you are pushing which packets through in a fragment
[12:40:40] <JEEB> then you will have to debug on the player/client side WTF is it taking its sweet time with. buffering or otherwise
[12:43:50] <danergo> thx! I will keep digging myself into it
[12:44:25] <JEEB> if your outputs stream can be read by FFmpeg, you can try `mpv --profile=low-latency`
[12:44:36] <JEEB> I think vlc 4 will also have a low latency mode
[12:44:43] <JEEB> that will attempt to minimize buffering etc
[12:47:07] <JEEB> but it really sounded with the case that you were describing that the player would catch up, and then since you were fragmenting on keyframes only, then the 10 second wait until the next fragment would be done and pushed out over the network would then cause the pause
[12:47:16] <JEEB> because the player was less than 10 seconds behind the live point
[12:47:50] <JEEB> and you really can't help that otherwise than fragmenting more often :P

[23:37:58] <danergo> in movenc, there are some useful fragmenting options like frag_keyframe, frag_every_frame, frag_custom
[23:38:25] <danergo> I need to setup these as options, before stream is started to be read and write
[23:38:54] <danergo> is there a known way to start the fragmentation of mp4 with `frag_every_frame`, then change it to `frag_keyframe`?
[23:39:12] <danergo> without loosing consistency of course
[23:39:43] <BtbN> I don't think there's a way to change those flags in the middle of a stream
