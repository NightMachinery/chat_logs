[04:28:13] <Arcsech> Hello folks! I've been hacking on the ABCL backend lately and got a few bug fixes and such that I'll be wrapping into a PR in a few days. I figured I'd hop on here and see if anyone has strong feelings about the ABCL backend - I've got a couple more invasive changes I'd like to contribute as well, but I'd rather talk with someone up front if there's a current maintainer.
[04:32:23] <Arcsech> The ABCL backend does some... interesting things, some of which are not ABCL specific at all and I think it might be nice to promote out of the backend, and some of which are... questionable IMO.
