[12:02:26] <Abhi[m]> > How do I now recognise I have to mark option d .
[12:03:01] <Abhi[m]> How do I recognise this dot ? I am writing some scripts I need to automate it
[12:03:10] <Abhi[m]> The marked option that is d . 
[12:03:10] <Abhi[m]> How can I automate knowing that the ans is d ?
[12:09:13] <E-man[m]> > <Abhi> The marked option that is d . 
[12:09:13] <E-man[m]> > How can I automate knowing that the ans is d ?
[12:09:13] <E-man[m]> You mean how do you automate the answer to the question or how do you know which option have been marked? The first one would be so complicated that if you CAN do it you probably have no need for it. XD
[12:10:24] <Abhi[m]> E-man[m]: I figured out the 1 one just stuck at the 2 one
[12:10:45] * Abhi[m] posted a file: (1661KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/t2bot.io/9e164c45ba5e05b432252f9f195b0b3be8177968/A1_slot_CT3_27_01_22_18MAB201T_Transforms_and_Boundary_Value_Problems.pdf >
[12:10:55] <Abhi[m]> People send me such pdf with marked Options
[12:11:46] <Abhi[m]> Abhi[m]: Like here the correct option is d . I just need to know that this is the correct option in script
[12:18:48] <E-man[m]> <Abhi[m]> "I figured out the 1 one just..." <- Okay so you are reading from PDF? That would make it a bit difficult. Just over the top of my head I would probably do something like this. First Would check if the PDF searchable? OCR should work out of the box for these but check first if the PDF is searchable/ have a raw text embed. Check how the radio buttons are encoded. Then you can just parse through, segment out the questions into
[12:18:48] <E-man[m]> some searchable DS. If the questions and the options comes jumbled youd need to search through in this to find the proper question and the proper option. 
[12:18:48] <E-man[m]> Where are you filling it up? On a site? Then youd need to know the Dom structure and I am guessing the questions would be an array of objects. Youd need to get the text content, compare and find the results and update the corresponding radio button.
[12:20:02] <E-man[m]> But do check out for monitoring tools. They can catch automated stuff for these in some sites.
[12:37:11] <gtlsgamr> Hi all
[12:37:14] <gtlsgamr> how's it going

[19:31:35] <gtlsgamr> ArnavGhosh[m]: The thing is, if you make your own IRC server, people will have to join it seperately
[19:31:39] <gtlsgamr> Just use libera
[19:31:56] <gtlsgamr> but other than that, full sampot.
[19:32:19] <ArnavGhosh[m]> i am not making irc like stuff
[19:33:16] <gtlsgamr> then what
[19:33:20] <ArnavGhosh[m]> Irc is, but i want to learn as well, and make my one a little bit easy to use and many more goals
[19:33:41] <ArnavGhosh[m]> I will make something totally different from it
[19:33:52] <gtlsgamr> So you are trying to make a communication protocol!
[19:33:55] <gtlsgamr> That's great!

[20:29:28] <JB[m]1> @BugsWriter whats that hst alias you are using?
[20:30:47] <Tor[m]> <gtlsgamr> "just type my name and I get..." <- This is why I always have red notifications ( in fluffychat) on cybersecurity chatrooms 
[20:32:49] <ArnavGhosh[m]> JB[m]1: Most probably : cat ~/.zsh_history | fzf | xclip
[20:32:53] <gtlsgamr> ArnavGhosh[m]: Your idea makes SENSE!
[20:33:02] <gtlsgamr> but it needs some clarity I think
[20:33:16] <gtlsgamr> lets get workin on it. Step one, create a paper plan.
[20:33:27] <gtlsgamr> Also, heavy bengali accent bro XD
[20:33:28] <ArnavGhosh[m]> yeah!!!
[20:33:55] <ArnavGhosh[m]> BTw why do we need a decentralized app? We use padoswali aunty
[20:34:00] <ArnavGhosh[m]> gtlsgamr: Yeah
[20:34:18] <ArnavGhosh[m]> Lemme make a Git Repo
[20:34:19] <ArnavGhosh[m]> gtlsgamr: Okay
[20:34:31] <gtlsgamr> sure
[20:34:40] <gtlsgamr> in that add an md file with a rough idea

[20:37:47] <ArnavGhosh[m]> NikunjChopra[m]: Its not neccesary bs= is not neccesarry
[20:37:49] <NikunjChopra[m]> ArnavGhosh[m]: My PC uses legacy bios so I need MBR
[20:37:53] <ArnavGhosh[m]> It just speeds up somehow!
[20:38:05] <Tor[m]> gtlsgamr: Kon thak gaya hai ;')
[20:38:08] <ArnavGhosh[m]> NikunjChopra[m]: just do dd, it should work

[20:40:18] <Tor[m]> gtlsgamr: Ha matlab raat ko shanti nahi milne wali ,we should have a moment of silence now 
[20:40:19] <NikunjChopra[m]> I can‚Äôt boot into windows otherwise rufus would‚Äôve made the job easy
[20:40:21] <NikunjChopra[m]> Too dumb for arch
[20:40:38] <ArnavGhosh[m]> Use Debian instead!?
[20:40:40] <NikunjChopra[m]> Antix has a shit ton of sound and Bluetooth problem
[20:40:45] <ArnavGhosh[m]> Same features
[20:41:13] <ArnavGhosh[m]> Baap hai sabka (almost) debian
[20:41:23] <ArnavGhosh[m]> Kali, Ubuntu, bodhi, u just nae it
[20:41:32] <NikunjChopra[m]> ArnavGhosh[m]: I know
[20:41:42] <NikunjChopra[m]> Bodhi is kinda easier to install
[20:42:01] <NikunjChopra[m]> Just tell me how to burn MBR iso image
[20:42:28] <NightFury[m]> NikunjChopra[m]: Try MX it's also easy to install

[20:42:34] <gtlsgamr> anyway good night bouys
[20:42:40] <gtlsgamr> i gots to go :()

[20:42:47] <gtlsgamr> ArnavGhosh[m]: lets tok tomoro
[20:43:02] <ArnavGhosh[m]> NikunjChopra[m]: Obviously
[20:43:04] <ArnavGhosh[m]> If you optimize it
[20:43:09] <NikunjChopra[m]> NightFury[m]: That‚Äôs what I used before I tried installing Bodhi
[20:43:36] <NikunjChopra[m]> ArnavGhosh[m]: Don‚Äôt have knowledge and time for optimisations
[20:44:18] <NikunjChopra[m]> NikunjChopra[m]: Tried antix as well but it has sound problems and Bluetooth problems

[21:57:18] <theo[m]> so, rsync it is

[22:51:21] <MohdAariz[m]> today i felt too holy
[22:51:25] <MohdAariz[m]> learning templeos cmdline
[22:52:33] <ArnavGhosh[m]> I feel pity for your eyes
[22:52:39] <ArnavGhosh[m]> No dark theme
[22:52:47] <ArnavGhosh[m]> How u survived?
[22:53:12] <y4g400> bhai kehna kya chahte ho?
[22:53:32] <ArnavGhosh[m]> U use dark theme?
[22:53:38] <y4g400> ya
[22:53:51] <ArnavGhosh[m]> then switch to light theme for a moment
[22:54:00] <ArnavGhosh[m]> Your eyes will pain
[22:55:30] <y4g400> it isn't that bad but i prefer dark mode

[22:56:32] <ArnavGhosh[m]> y4g400: its not bad, its evil! Your eyes tend to degrade more, because of more bluelight
[22:58:02] <Aryan[m]> Bruh, using light mode during day makes more sense to me as it requires a really good screen to do dark mode well in light...
[22:58:48] <ArnavGhosh[m]> Try using a light terminal! Even in daylight it doesnt work well
[22:59:03] <ArnavGhosh[m]> I am not against lght theme
[22:59:24] <Aryan[m]> Because somehow all light terminal themes that I've used are shit lol
[22:59:47] <Aryan[m]> Light theme for code editors are good tho
[22:59:47] <ArnavGhosh[m]> but swear to me, how many people remain under the sky most of the time, using terminal
