[00:00:00] <wedr> Maybe we didn't realize there was a connection pool
[00:00:10] <niku> grep 'url="jdbc' context.xml
[00:02:15] <wedr> Did that. In the context.xml, we do have the jdbc resource link name defined in both the context.xml, server.xml, and our JNDI data source lookup.
[00:02:41] <wedr> "name. Defined", not "name defined"
[00:03:34] <wedr> Our DevOps said it is bewildered how there is nothing wrong with the configuration. In fact, we deployed 5 webapps, and only 1 webapp returns a different database schema.
[00:04:14] <wedr> All of them uses the same configuration. Only 4 of them connected to the right database schema, and just 1 outlier out of them all.
[00:05:18] <wedr> I kind of wanted to experiment and see what would happen if we -don't- use any of the JNDI data source for that particular outlier webapp, and just force it to connect to the correct database schema.
[00:10:01] <niku> I don't think we have enough information to really help at this point, but something is different if 3 are acting one way and another isn't. I'd try debugging it and steping through the method that's calling the jdbc/jndi connection
[00:10:26] <niku> here's a video on remote debugging tomcat w/ vscode if you haven't done that before. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9mugpHWr14

[23:15:32] <zumba_addict> back, i gathered more info
[23:16:28] <zumba_addict> so we have hop boxes that we accessed via ssh. We would like to turn them off completely so that our users will switch to the new way which is using ssm to terminal to the instances
[23:16:51] <zumba_addict> but I think my teammate said, if we use ssm, there is only one account that is always used
[23:17:04] <zumba_addict> we won't be able to monitor who's logging in to the instances
[23:17:14] <rawtaz> hmm whats ssm? never heard that before i think
[23:17:30] <zumba_addict> Amazon's System Server manager agent
[23:17:36] <rawtaz> oh right
[23:17:57] <rawtaz> looks like its abbreviated ASM now lol
[23:18:07] <zumba_addict> not sure, let me check
[23:18:26] <zumba_addict> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html
[23:18:32] <zumba_addict> maybe ASM is accepted too :)
[23:21:52] <rawtaz> i read "AWS Systems Manager (formerly known as SSM)" on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.html
[23:22:52] <rawtaz> i have no idea about what you ask though. to me it sounds like you need a way to use multiple accounts with the ASM. maybe something about it is explained in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html
