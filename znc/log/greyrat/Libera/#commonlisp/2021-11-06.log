[02:20:45] <lisp123> How much time do you spend in the REPL?
[02:21:35] <_death> a lot?
[02:22:10] <lisp123> Yeah, it seems quite useful. I've taken it for granted in Emacs/Slime because its just another window
[02:22:33] <lisp123> I'm experimenting with LW right now, and its a whole another frame (in Emacs parlance), and not so easy to switch to/away from
[02:22:35] <_death> I write my code to support convenient interactive use in the REPL
[02:22:56] <lisp123> _death: I've started doing that a lot too
[02:25:34] <_death> what makes switching more difficult in lispworks?
[02:26:37] <lisp123> So in Emacs I can split my frame vertically / horizontally with C-x 3 & C-x 2 and cycle through windows with C-x o. So I just launch full screen Emacs on a large monitor and its great experience
[02:27:09] <lisp123> Lispworks is the same, but the REPL cannot be added (as far as I can tell) into the same frame, it always is its own frame (window in non-emacs terms)
[02:27:45] <mfiano> EXWM :)
[02:27:51] <_death> right.. even if it's in another frame, with a tiling manager and/or two screens..
[02:28:21] <lisp123> So there is a slight lag when cycling back and forth + you can't have both visible together during full screen, and you have to use the mouse a lot to resize (e.g. REPL in top right, editor in bottom right and then top left / bottom left)
[02:28:43] <mfiano> Sounds like you need a tiling window manager.
[02:29:05] <mfiano> With EXWM, Emacs is your window manager.

[02:38:48] <_death> it's been a long time since I saw lispworks UI screenshots, but my vague recollection is that they were implemented as MDI applications on windows, so probably had a Windows menu where you could tell it to arrange the windows as well.. maybe on mac it's the same

[02:40:00] <lisp123> _death: So the editor (which is for source code) can be tiled quite nicely, it just seems like the listener (repl) is separate. I'll ask their lisp-hug group but I poured over their docs and it seems unlikely. Otherwise I really liked their implementation

[02:42:48] <Catie> I'm guilty of both
[02:44:18] <lisp123> The advantage of jumping over to FreeBSD/Linux is that I can finally start playing around with McClim properly

[02:47:55] <Catie> You get to tweak some of the settings for Freetype and Fontconfig if you build them from ports, so hopefully that helps with the font rendering!

[03:05:48] <random-nick> freetype and fontconfig have had plenty of font rendering improvements in the past few years, but I don't know how it affects mcclim
[03:09:26] <Catie> I could be mistaken, I was under the impression that they were used by X to do its text rendering
[03:12:22] <Catie> They appear to be, at least according to the FreeBSD handbook. Does McCLIM not have X render its text, does it use a different mechanism?
[03:14:06] <random-nick> I am not sure, but mcclim does not seem to follow fontconfig settings on my system (at least by default)
[03:18:16] <Catie> Hmm, it seems to be using my Fontconfig fonts, though they look a bit fuzzier than in other applications
[03:19:23] <random-nick> on my system the anti-aliasing on fonts in mcclim is grayscale, might be why they look fuzzy
[03:20:06] <mfiano> If I recall, the CLX backend does not honor the X resources database.
[03:20:27] <mfiano> So ignores things like DPI and hinting settings
[03:20:53] <random-nick> fontconfig provides that information separately afaik
[03:21:11] <mfiano> That may have changed, but it was one reason why I could not bear to use McCLIM on a high DPI monitor
[03:21:36] <mfiano> I couldn't accurately click on some widgets with how tiny they were
[03:25:36] <random-nick> mcclim seems to have code for rendering using X to draw fonts, to use freetype+fontconfig and to use pure common lisp anti-aliased font rendering
[03:25:48] <random-nick> can't find what it uses by default

[03:43:55] <Catie> Okay yeah, it appears that on my system the default is :CLX-TTF, and when I use just plain :CLX I get some broken font handling
[03:45:44] <random-nick> :clx presumably uses the old X11 protocols for rendering fonts

[04:29:35] <holycow> you just built something i wanted for years for diagramming networks when doing site surverys
[04:30:03] <holycow> always wanted a side pane where i could use s-experssions to define hierarchical relationship and have the main window draw it out.
[04:30:12] <holycow> and in your case, draw a ui
[04:30:40] <holycow> nice work
[04:30:47] <holycow> what do you think of mcclim?
[04:32:00] <_death> it's not difficult to do that kind of stuff with mcclim.. but there are many rough edges.. for example at first I wanted to use the drei editor with syntax highlighting etc., but it was extremely slow, even with little snippets like in the video
[04:32:32] <holycow> interesting
[04:32:48] <holycow> i can't wait until someone wraps lem in mcclim
[04:34:28] <holycow> does mcclim use ltk to draw the widgets or does it draw all the widgets it self?

[04:34:43] <_death> it does it itself

[07:19:18] <Guest74> hey, mfiano: have you posted your wave collapse stuff anywhere?
[07:20:43] <mfiano> It is not efficient, nor documented, but it's one of two texture synthesis algorithms in this repository: https://github.com/mfiano/syntex
[07:21:11] <Guest74> that might be private, 404
[07:22:42] *** Quits: igemnace (~ian@user/igemnace) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:22:45] <mfiano> So it is. I guess I wasn't ready for the world to look at that code.
[07:22:49] <mfiano> Fixed
[07:23:54] <Guest74> thanks. Always nice to see other peoples approaches, especially more competent people.
[07:23:55] <mfiano> The algorithm itself is not guaranteed to halt and very difficult to optimize for space. I have to rewrite the propagator
[07:24:55] <mfiano> Currently it uses a naive backtracking approach, so has to store arbitrarily-sized vectors for each pixel for each iteration
[07:25:28] <mfiano> I have ideas on how to make it more space friendly, but I am on hiatus at the moment
[07:28:21] <Guest74> no problem.  I'm sure I'll learn something from looking at it.
[07:30:28] <beach> Good morning everyone!
[07:30:40] <mfiano> This algorithm sort of led me on an intense interest in propagation networks and traditional AI algorithms, so have been reading papers and books for the last...8 months it seems
[07:31:33] <mfiano> Oh make that 5...not as long as I thought, good :)
[07:33:34] <Guest74> Do you use anything to keep track of all that?
[07:33:41] <mfiano> The problem is this algorithm is very sensitive to state changes, and I don't full understand why it fails with some of my more sophisticated backtracking algorithms
[07:33:44] <Guest74> I've got like a bazillion tabs open.
[07:33:53] <mfiano> Org mode
[07:34:08] <mfiano> Particularly, OrgRoam
[07:34:25] <Guest74> I'll look into it.
[07:34:51] <Guest74> Do you have visualizer for it running?
[07:34:59] <mfiano> No
[07:35:06] <Guest74> I often find seeing stuff in action helps to see what's going wrong.
[07:35:22] <mfiano> I use the inspector and Sly stickers for that
[07:35:49] <Guest74> those aren't graphical are they?
[07:35:58] <Guest74> I have trouble with just numbers.
[07:38:10] <mfiano> No, not really. A visualizer wasn't in my interest because of how much memory is required for small input images with the current approach. I was constantly blowing my heap, and I would like to rewrite the propagator before storing even more state for animation.
[07:38:25] <mfiano> Like I said, it is very space-inefficient
[07:38:46] <Guest74> ah, I guess I'll see when I try it out.
[07:38:54] *** Quits: semz (~none@user/semz) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[07:43:06] <mfiano> I may consider rewriting that algorithm in a less awful style with generic functions soon. For now, I'm just letting the subconscious thoughts accumulate for a bit.
[07:43:21] <mfiano> That code really wasn't meant to see the light of day :)
[07:43:39] <Guest74> lol, i've got tons of that stuff.
[07:43:58] <Guest74> usually gets totally rewritten after doing other things for a while.
[07:49:02] <mfiano> Well, that code was started late last year, and I have since changed my stance on using standard classes and generic functions with proper protocols, over the minimal performance gains of heavily type-annotated functions and structure classes spread out across many mutually dependent package madness.
[07:50:02] <Guest74> I'm a little confused, i thought it was pixel based, but I see tile everywhere.
[07:51:10] <mfiano> Only the top-left pixel of a tile contributes to the output image.
[07:51:23] *** Joins: semz (~none@user/semz)
[07:51:51] <mfiano> Reading that code probably assumes a lot of domain knowledge on image convolution kernels and whatnot
[07:55:10] <Guest74> It's been a while. apparently my code is 2 years old in 2 weeks.  but i seem to recall doing whole tiles as a separate method.
[07:55:27] <mfiano> But no, it isn't pixel-based. Like most texture syntesizers it uses image convolution, so the kernel is the atomic unit.
[07:56:34] <mfiano> A tile is basically an instance of a kernel as it slides over the image, with state recording all possible patterns that can exist.
[07:56:45] <mfiano> iirc anyway

[10:48:53] <guthur> CFFI question. I have a callback function had receives a struct A and translation-from-foreign function on the type A. This works great except that CFFI complains about bare references to structs being deprecated, and that I should use (:pointer (:struct A)) but the problem there is that it does not seem to invoke the translate-from-foreign
[10:48:54] <guthur> function if i use that form. Any suggestions?

[21:08:48] <Guest7468> not sure if I should add/remove the &optional (socket *socket*)
[21:09:33] <Guest7468> or change status codes to something more verbose?
[21:09:53] <Guest7468> and how much do you document an implementation of a documented protocol?

[21:17:28] *** Joins: thomaslewis (6e04fe5c02@mail.nobodyhasthe.biz)
[21:18:29] <Catie> You do include a link in the source to the protocol. You might describe what part of the protocol each function implements
[21:19:53] <pjb> Guest7468: defparameter +status-codes+ --> either defparameter *status-codes* or defconstant +status-codes+ ; don't mix them, you'll have problem.
[21:19:57] <Catie> You could also define symbolic constants for your opcodes with the same name as in the protocol. So instead of 4 it would be +get-option-descriptors+ or +sane-net-get-option-descriptors+ if you want to keep it exactly the same
[21:20:44] <pjb> Guest7468: read-word/write-word the symetric of ldb is dpb.
[21:20:57] <Guest7468> I guess I should mention it's the protocol with just sane_net dropped and kebobed
[21:21:26] <Guest7468> In the readme or source?
[21:21:44] <Guest7468> the defparameters are just development convenience so sbcl doesn't yell at me.
[21:22:03] <pjb> Guest7468: sane-string: it would be more efficient to use replace to store stuff in your array.  Also, are you sure you want to exclude unicode?
[21:22:38] *** Quits: guthur (~guthur@149.167.145.129) (Quit: Client closed)
[21:22:39] <Guest7468> the protocol dictates only ansi.
[21:22:48] <pjb> ansi what?
[21:22:51] <pjb> ascii?
[21:22:54] <Guest7468> right
[21:22:59] <Guest7468> thats what i mean :)
[21:23:02] <pjb> ok.
[21:23:19] <Catie> Okay yeah I get you, with the protocol names
[21:23:26] <Catie> Why is it openc instead of open though?
[21:23:31] <pjb> Guest7468: read-string: you do 1+ in sane-string therefore read-string is missing 1-
[21:24:07] *** Parts: thomaslewis (6e04fe5c02@mail.nobodyhasthe.biz) ()
[21:25:22] <Guest7468> catie: to open discussion as to whether it should be open like the protocol or change it to open-device which is what it really seems to be.
[21:25:52] *** Joins: tyson2 (~user@bras-vprn-toroon020aw-lp130-17-184-148-154-245.dsl.bell.ca)
[21:25:58] <pjb> Guest7468: (aref +value-type+ (read-word stream)) while you may count on your CL implementation to signal an error, 1- it's not guaranteed with all optimization level, 2- you should still expect evil input, so validate explicitely your input:
[21:26:31] <Guest7468> pjb: I'm not getting what you mean with the string part.
[21:26:52] <Catie> open-device does better describe what the function does, but it also makes the naming scheme less consistent
[21:27:02] <Guest7468> I need to read the complete string with nul byte or I've got dangling bytes in the socket.
[21:27:44] <pjb> Guest7468: sane-string generates a null-terminate string, with a length including this nul byte.  But read-string reads this nul byte, and removes it later. It's better to just allocate 1- length characters instead.
[21:27:47] <Guest7468> catie: yeah, that was my concern.  I guess open and close is better since it follows the api better.
[21:28:03] <pjb> Guest7468: notably, remove will also remove the nul bytes in the middle of the string.
[21:29:24] <Guest7468> I'm not sure I should be concerned with whether SANE is compromised on a persons home network.
[21:29:40] <pjb> Guest7468: get-devices should take a socket argument too.
[21:30:24] <Guest7468> *socket* needs to be bound for all calls besides init.  I believe it's in the readme.  Should I put that in the source?
[21:30:54] <Guest7468> should I have the optional socket? or leave frontend implementors to always bind *socket*?
[21:30:56] <pjb> No, it's good, but get-devices is not consistent with the other functions with &optional socket.
[21:31:07] <pjb> neither get-option-descriptors
[21:31:14] <pjb> or control-optino
[21:31:17] <pjb> etc.
[21:31:22] <pjb> you need to be consistent.
[21:31:24] <Guest7468> Yes, it's there to bring up the discussion of whether or not to do it that way.

[21:32:18] <pjb> also, if instead of taking a socket argument, you'd take a stream argument, most of your code would be independent of usocket, and could be easily used with other API, or tested without sockets.
[21:33:02] <Guest7468> as for the strings, I think you're missing that read-string is reading the string over the network.  They're adding the nul byte.
[21:33:24] <pjb> Indeed.
[21:33:36] <pjb> That's why the string is 1- length long.
[21:34:10] <Guest7468> but i'm not allocating an array for the string. just for the sequence read from the stream.
[21:34:43] <Guest7468> interesting about taking a stream.  I'll have to think about that.
[21:34:45] <pjb> Now, in general, you could write a macro to generate all those functions, since they're all quite similar.

[21:38:53] <Guest7468> yes, and I already said it was there for discussion.

[21:48:18] <Guest7468> oh there is
[21:48:36] <Guest7468> I guess I'll add all that stuff there.  though still not sure anybody will see it.
[21:51:01] <Guest7468> ok, thanks guys.  Maybe somebody else will chime in with preferences over option to pass sockets or just binding nsane:*socket*
[21:51:29] <pjb> Guest7468: I told you: be consistent !
[21:51:32] <Catie> I can't speak for anyone else, but I definitely look for package documentation
[21:51:57] <pjb> Guest7468: you let the user choose how to use it, but functions that don't have it force to use *socket*, so it's inconsistent!
[21:52:52] <Guest7468> and i told you it was there for discussion.
[21:53:17] <pjb> And the discussion is to be consistent.
[21:53:32] <Guest7468> ok pjb.
[21:54:22] <Guest7468> catie: I don't think I've ever seen package documentation.  Now I'm curious and will have to check.
[21:54:44] <Catie> Oh I don't know that I have either, but I look for it every time in the hopes that I'll be pleasantly surprised
[21:55:18] <Guest7468> i hope to one day pleasantly surprise you!
[21:55:48] <Guest7468> asdf:defsystem doesn't seem to have documentation.  that seems like a big miss.
[21:56:07] <Guest7468> oh i'm looking in the wrong place.
[21:57:52] <Catie> It would be in the package itself
[21:58:14] <Catie> Though now I'm wondering if that's part of the standard or an SBCL extension
[21:58:54] <Guest7468> just that most of my systems are collections of packages.  It does have long-description.
[21:59:12] <Catie> It does not appear to be an extension, CCL supports it as well
[21:59:17] <Guest7468> package documentation is part of the standard i looked.
