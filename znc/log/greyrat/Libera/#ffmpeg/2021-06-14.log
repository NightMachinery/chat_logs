[03:04:23] <asmandos> doesn't look like it is

[03:29:12] <Vatuu> I am doing a rudamentary recording thing using x264 and x265

[03:29:49] <Vatuu> Is there a way to pad a frame to ensure it meets that requirement, or can I disable that somehow
[03:30:32] <kepstin> hmm? no, no power of 2 restriction. they both support arbitrary frame sizes limited by the pixel format
[03:30:57] <Vatuu> Really?
[03:31:14] <Vatuu> Because I get the following error when trying to encode a non-power-of-two set of frames:
[03:31:26] <kepstin> in particular, if you're using a pixel format with subsampled chroma (like 4:2:0) it can't handle  partial chroma pixels, so must be a mulltiple of 2
[03:31:41] <kepstin> but you could convert to non-subsampled chroma if you need that
[03:32:12] <Vatuu> Well, I am using yuv420p for my pixel format
[03:32:51] *** Quits: SpeakerToMeat (~Speaker@user/speakertomeat) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[03:33:10] <kepstin> keep in mind that this is a multiple of 2, not power of two :)
[03:34:15] <Vatuu> Well, yes, that's what I mean
[03:34:17] <Vatuu> "x265 [error]: Picture height must be an integer multiple of the specified chroma subsampling"
[03:34:34] <Vatuu> So I should just pick a different pixel format then?
[03:35:33] <kepstin> yes, you could convert to yuv444p for example. then there's no subsampling, so you can crop on arbitrary pixels.

[03:36:34] <Vatuu> So what other options do I have
[03:36:36] <kepstin> what's the original video source, and what do you want to do with the encoded result?
[03:37:22] <Vatuu> The source is a opengl framebuffer, the target is most likely going to be further processing in stuff like video editing stuff
[03:38:28] *** Joins: tlacatlc6 (~tlacatlc6@097-101-132-062.res.spectrum.com)
[03:38:44] <kepstin> i assume the original opengl framebuffer is rgb?
[03:39:25] <kepstin> you should probably use either rgb encoding, or at least yuv444p (no chroma subsampling) up until the point at which you're encoding a final video file for playback in e.g. web browsers
[03:39:44] <Vatuu> rgba, but yes
[03:40:19] <Vatuu> From what I've seen, x265 and x264 can't do rgb though?
[03:41:16] <kepstin> both can, although for x264 you have to use the encoder name alias "libx264rgb".
[03:41:42] <kepstin> but that's kind of a specialized/unusual format, so it's possible your video editing stuff might not be able to read it
[03:41:49] <Vatuu> I guess I'll just go with yuv444p
[03:41:54] <Vatuu> Adobe stuff can process that, right
[03:42:00] <kepstin> should test that first. If it doesn't, then yuv444p is probably the best you can do

[04:11:33] <BtbN> x264 and x265 are software encoders
[04:11:50] <BtbN> And the x264 opencl stuff often even makes it slower, soo
[04:12:00] <Vatuu> Oh.
[04:12:14] <Vatuu> So, what is the ideal way to enable hardware acceleration then?
[04:12:34] <BtbN> Use the appropiate hardware encoder that matches the hardware you want to utilize
[04:13:18] <Vatuu> So that means I need to verify connected devices
[04:13:19] <Vatuu> Ungh
[04:14:08] <BtbN> There is no generic way to use hwaccel encoding

[16:30:27] <bencc1__> I'm trying to understand how the amix filter work
[16:30:33] <bencc1__> it has frame_list_next_frame_size() function
[16:30:53] <bencc1__> don't all frames have the same nb_samples size?
[16:31:03] <bencc1__> why does it change?
[16:31:10] <bencc1__> https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/af__amix_8c_source.html
[16:34:49] <BtbN> Why would they? Audio frames can have pretty much every size imagineable
[16:35:00] <BtbN> Various codecs use various frame sizes
[16:35:15] <znf> The AMF stuff needs an AMD GPU, right? It doesn't work with the CPUs alone
[16:35:22] <znf> (outside of their APU)
[16:36:26] <bencc1__> BtbN: can the frame size vary over time as well?
[16:36:48] <bencc1__> I think the mixer assumes that all inputs have the same frame size

[17:41:17] <kepstin> keep in mind that faststart mode also rewrites the file a second time after it finishes.
[17:43:18] <DeHackEd> or even the file framerate. 25 fps? 60fps? that can be a big difference maker

[17:51:31] <BtbN> It will re-write the entire file, so for 17GB, on a slow external drive, that can take a bit
[17:51:38] <kepstin> if you have a file that's already mov/mp4 and just want to do a single rewrite to move the MOOV to the start, there's a specialized tool "qt-faststart" provided by the ffmpeg project to do that.

[21:40:59] <Eric_23> Yes, I saw this but I'm pretty much having a problem using it
[21:41:14] <Eric_23> So I'm trying to use the silencedetect filter to remove the intervals of silence that it detects right?
[21:41:22] <Eric_23> So say I have a 30 second video
[21:41:36] <Eric_23> and it detects silence at [3,5] and [10,12]

[21:42:41] <Eric_23> This is the filter that I have been trying so far
[21:42:57] <Eric_23> However, for some reason, the output wav file is the same as the input wav file
[21:43:00] <furq> silencedetect doesn't remove anything
[21:43:05] <kepstin> silencedetect doesn't modify the output in any way. it just detects silence to let you know where it is
[21:43:13] <furq> you want silenceremove maybe
[21:43:32] <Eric_23> silenceremove doesn't remove the correct intervals when using the same parameters for some reason
[21:43:42] <kepstin> you can use the silenceremove filter to remove silence in one pass, or you can use the information from silencedetect to e.g. write a concat format script file with inpoint and output for example.
[21:44:38] <Eric_23> So, if I wanted to use silencedetect to remove audio, do I need to do it in two commands? 1. Find the intervals of silence 2. Use the aselect filter to remove the audio segments ?
[21:44:53] <Eric_23> Because I just wanted to make it concise and only use one line

[21:45:38] <Eric_23> Okay thank you, that's all I needed to know
[21:45:52] <Eric_23> silenceremove doesn't remove the same intervals detected from silencedetect
[21:47:10] <kepstin> hmm. actually, do the expressions in the asepect filter allow you to read frame metadata?

[21:54:15] <kepstin> i don't see any indication that you can read arbitrary frame metadata fields? if so, you could use aselect filter directly after silencedetect and have it use the frame metadata to decide which audio to include
[21:55:03] <sr20det> Eric_23: have you tried silenceremove=stop_periods=-1:stop_duration=1:stop_threshold=-50dB ?
[21:55:28] <Eric_23> Yes
[21:55:42] <kepstin> aselect has special handling for the metadata fields created by the concat demuxer, but doesn't appear to give a way to use the fields created by the silencedetect filter
[21:55:54] <Eric_23> Would you like to see an example of what happens when I use the same parameters on the same audio file? sr20det

[21:56:03] <kepstin> hmm. but they're similar enough it probably wouldn't be hard to add, heh
[21:56:05] <sr20det> yes
[21:56:11] <Eric_23> One second

[21:59:26] <Eric_23> Okay, as you can see here, the audio file is 2:53 seconds and it detected about 6 seconds of silence
[21:59:40] <Eric_23> This is the command I ran
[21:59:42] <Eric_23> ffmpeg -i input.wav -af silencedetect=noise=-30dB:d=3 -f null -
[21:59:50] <Eric_23> Okay?
[22:00:16] <Eric_23> But now when I run the silenceremove command with the same parameters (dB= -30dB, d = 3 sec)
[22:00:20] <Eric_23> This is what happens

[22:03:33] <Eric_23> ffmpeg -i input.wav -af silenceremove=stop_periods=-1:stop_duration=3:stop_threshold=-30dB output.wav
[22:03:37] <Eric_23> This is the command that I ran
[22:03:59] <Eric_23> As you can see it removed way more than the 6 or so seconds of audio that I was expecting it to

[22:05:53] <sr20det> first guess is m in detect and _mode in remove
[22:06:01] <sr20det> file is stereo

[22:08:32] <Eric_23> Removed more audio than was expected

[22:10:09] <Eric_23> Same result
[22:10:56] <sr20det> no idea than
[22:11:10] <Eric_23> Thanks though
[22:11:36] <Eric_23> If anyone does happen to know, I would love to just use silenceremove rather than using silencedetect to remove the audio
[22:14:36] <furq> they don't use the same code for silence detection if it wasn't obvious from them having such different options
[22:14:42] <furq> so you probably just need to mess around with the params
[22:15:37] <Eric_23> Ah thanks
[22:15:54] <Eric_23> Seems silenceremove is more sensitive than silencedetect
