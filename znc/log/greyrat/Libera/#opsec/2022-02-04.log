[02:53:14] <Joanna> jan6: plastic falls apart by itself after a number of years. Glass will stay the same.
[02:53:53] <Joanna> Although I’ve heard that old glass windows are thicker at the bottom
[02:54:00] <jan6> glass degrades with use, plastic reacts with stuff and degrades with time
[02:54:44] <jan6> that's a forever-myth-battle, lol, "glass flows slowly" vs "manifacturing and design choices" or whatnot
[02:55:03] <jan6> also, as it should be: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOcWtq5EOHU
[02:55:03] <Joanna> Degrades from being broken or abrasions maybe
[02:57:23] <jan6> related to the glass argument: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqhXsEgLMJ0
[03:04:00] <Joanna> Glass is an amorphous solid.

[03:49:15] <Joanna> So technically glass is a very thick liquid.
[03:50:21] <technonerd_> as is pitch (tar)
[03:50:39] <technonerd_> the experimenter died before the pitch dripped
[03:56:37] <Joanna> Tar probably contains a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphaltene and other hydrocarbon molecules that are more volatile, hence the horrible smell

[05:18:40] <Roey> I reached the Final Stage in the interview process for this job 
[05:18:53] <Roey> speaking with the president & vice president.
[05:18:56] <Roey> like, the final bosses.
[05:19:01] <jan6> premade as in, like slap together an about.me or github pages, and maybe handle a form with netlify
[05:19:02] <Roey> I think I passed.  I hope I did.
[05:19:10] <jan6> also, prepaid disposable numbers ;P
[05:19:13] <Roey> :)
[05:19:19] <Roey> you know what the Indian recruiters do with your junx?
[05:19:22] <Roey> they apply in your name.
[05:19:32] <Roey> they put your name on their bid packages
[05:19:34] <Roey> then they call you.
[05:19:45] <jan6> hah
[05:19:50] <Roey> this is what one Indian friend of mine who works in IT told me
[05:19:59] <jan6> and then what?
[05:20:00] <Roey> s/Indian/Pakistani.
[05:20:20] <jan6> they won't have your ID or stuff, after all
[05:20:23] <Roey> jan6: oh, I don't know that they do anything nefarious with it
[05:20:30] <Roey> I'm not talking about the Indian scammers
[05:20:50] <jan6> and if they pretend you applied to them, then "just say no", ez
[05:20:50] <Roey> --however--sometimes it gets difficult to discern between them when their phone number fucking reads "POTENTIAL SPAM"

[06:39:52] <Joanna> jan6: before it was easy to spam phone numbers and email there were door to door salesmen which must have been very unpleasant
[06:40:27] <Joanna> That’s where the term get your foot in the door probably came from.
[06:40:43] <jan6> I've only ever heard of 'em from usa and a liiitle bit from britain ;P
[06:40:54] <jan6> and probably partially, yes
[06:41:19] <jan6> getting a foot in the door predates the salesmen, of course, but that might've well popularized it
[06:41:46] <Joanna> I guess the door to door selling was stopped by making it impossible to get anywhere walking...
[06:41:57] <jan6> naaaah
[06:42:17] <Joanna> Door to door is good for dense urban areas
[06:42:35] <jan6> it was stopped when the returns vs investments went too low compared to other methods, e.g. phone calls or web ads
[06:43:09] <jan6> you have to pay a bunch of people, to maybe try some...what...20? 30? houses, of which most will refuse
[06:43:21] <Joanna> Also getting rid of house wives who would be home during the day also made nobody to sell to
[06:43:29] <jan6> vs you pay half as many people to call 100 people, and set up ads seen by a million
[06:44:26] <jan6> door-to-door was a thing because it was the only way to actually reach people, at the time
[06:44:40] <Joanna> Sure smart ads to only target the people who might be interested helps
[06:45:10] <jan6> like literally only options were magazine/newspaper (too expensive to detail much info), radio (way expensive), or door-to-door ads
[06:45:33] <jan6> once more and cheaper avenues became a thing, of course they jumped to that instead
[06:46:19] <Joanna> So now we have dead neighborhoods with nobody walking around and nobody home or home with windows and blinds shut like a dope addict hiding from police.
[06:46:44] <jan6> people aren't walking around because they have nowhere to go
[06:46:58] <Joanna> They are driving in cars
[06:46:59] <jan6> because they can just sit in one place at work, and rest of the day at home
[06:47:12] <jan6> and then take a short trip to the store, just to sit home some more
[06:47:13] <Joanna> There are always cars
[06:47:48] <jan6> why wouldn't there be cars, how else are car companies gonna stay strong
[06:47:53] <jan6> ;P
[06:48:03] <jan6> cars are real good for transporting stuff
[06:48:05] <Joanna> Children don’t play outside anymore. Everyone is isolated in their separate cages away from the strangers nearby
[06:48:27] <jan6> it's almost always self-isolation
[06:48:46] <Joanna> Do you know everyone in your neighborhood?
[06:48:51] <jan6> e.g. give a kid a tablet, and they probably won't WANT to go outside, etc
[06:48:56] <jan6> also here this isn't a problem
[06:49:05] <jan6> I don't, but I don't want to, either
[06:49:15] <Joanna> If you house was destroyed would your neighbors take you in ?
[06:49:26] <Joanna> Would you take them in?
[06:49:33] <jan6> obviously not, for both
[06:49:53] <Joanna> So you have no community then
[06:50:07] <jan6> community is in your imagination
[06:50:38] <jan6> some people do know each other, some don't
[06:51:17] <Joanna> If you run out of money you will be left outside to die. How does that feel?
[06:51:33] <jan6> e.g. my mother, who owns half our house (other half grandmother), DOES know most people, at least aquinted enough to know about who they are, if nothing else
[06:51:51] <jan6> nobody is left outside to die, dummy
