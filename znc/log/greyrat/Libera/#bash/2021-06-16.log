In the application, I replace `false` with `bar` that will either work or fail almost immediately. If it doesn't fail immediately, it will spawn a GUI window, but I don't want the script to hold until that GUI window is closed.

[03:06:04] <nDuff> emacspenguin: ...see the POSIX test standard at https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/test.html -- it doesn't specify == at all, so while it works when your shell is bash, it'll fail with ash or other baseline-POSIX shells.

[10:11:08] <PlayerOne> Hey all ^^
[10:11:17] <jmcantrell> I'm writing a script that handles positional parameters similar to something like cp or mv, where I need to do something with all but the last paramater. Is there something like shift but for the end of $@ ?
[10:11:19] <PlayerOne> Why read loops ends when I try read in this loop?
[10:13:03] <PlayerOne> Like while read IFS=, A B do c="$( grep ... < <( cat someFile | head -n 10 ) )"; done < <( cat someFile | tail -n +10 )
[10:13:13] <PlayerOne> This loops ends after first read line, but why?
[10:13:24] <PlayerOne> The first loop, I meant
[10:14:20] <eschwartz> jmcantrell: do you need this in bash or POSIX sh? The former has plenty of facilities for processing arrays, the latter is very... limited.
[10:14:48] <jmcantrell> eschwartz: I'm fine with just bash.

[10:19:39] <uplime> i didn't know it would hide $0 in there if you tell it to start at the beginning

[13:08:55] <PlayerOne> jmcantrell, you said it'll handle spaces.
[13:09:44] <geirha> it does handle spaces. It quotes them so it can be injected into another bash instance and the space will remain a literal space and not syntactical

[17:59:20] <greybot> the completion facility is built-in, but it needs to be told the appropriate details for each command. The *package* called "bash-completion" is a grab-bag of such definitions, of rather varying quality. But you can simply put your own definitions in your .bashrc to override any faulty or missing ones

[22:27:10] <Swahili> Q: wrote the following script to get the latest commit hash into a file ( https://paste.sh/mGP5TAM6#XFcP5y0DaUSbYZly58dtAHAa ). Is it done correctly? Any red flag?
[22:27:30] <lopid> !set-e
[22:27:30] <greybot> "set -e" is an inheritance of the old bourne shell, and doesn't really work well with modern shell features. You'll really have less buggy scripts if you do the error handling manually instead of relying on the unreliable "set -e"; see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105
[22:27:37] <Soliton> !check
[22:27:37] <checkbot> Soliton: Unable to read that :/
[22:28:06] <Soliton> mapfile -t a < <(git ls ...)
[22:28:57] <lopid> there'll likely be a --pretty that will get you just the hash from git log -1
[22:29:40] <Swahili> thanks for the feedback!
[22:29:48] <Swahili> I'll check mapfile -t a < <(git ls ...)
[22:29:50] <Soliton> is the wordsplitting abuse to get the first word or first line?
[22:29:57] <Swahili> lopid: humm didn't find a way
[22:30:06] <lopid> #git maybe
[22:30:07] <Soliton> read -a if it's for the first word.
[22:30:10] <Swahili> Soliton: lol... split on whitespace...just to get the first word lol
