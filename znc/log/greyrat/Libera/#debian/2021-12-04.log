[02:39:53] <dob1> to use sudo su - user the user need to have a shell define on /etc/passwd ?
[02:40:02] <dob1> *defined
[02:40:23] <sney> !sudo su
[02:40:24] <dpkg> Typing "sudo su" is like typing "cat file | cat".  If you want a non-login shell as root, just use "sudo -s".  If you want a login shell, "sudo -i".  There's no need to run two different superuser-elevation programs chained back to back.  See also <buster su>
[02:40:58] <sney> but yes, if you were to do it correctly with sudo -u username -i, the username would need to have a shell
[02:41:13] <sney> if you did it as sudo -u username -s, no shell is needed
[02:42:29] <xx> sney: you sure about that?
[02:42:39] <xx> -s reads /etc/passwd

[02:44:09] <sney> yeah I've used it pretty often for testing things from service accounts in the past
[02:44:20] <xx> that's so strange
[02:44:23] <sney> and... yep, works just fine on my naemon container for the naemon acct, which has /bin/false
[02:44:30] <dob1> It's not clear to me login/no login shell
[02:44:56] <sney> login shell mainly is about setting the environment
[02:45:03] <sney> try them back to back, and compare
[02:45:04] <xx> sney: I tested it too, and it works as you describe it, but have you seen the manpage entry for -s?
[02:45:21] <sney> I have not looked at the sudo manpage in quite a long time
[02:46:01] <dob1> sney, you are referring to env ?
[02:46:10] <xx> I'm having a hard time reconciling what the manpage says for -s, and what happens when I try it with a user that has /sbin/nologin as login shell
[02:46:37] <sney> on my system it says 'Run the shell specified by the SHELL environment variable if it is set or the shell specified by the invoking user's password database entry.'
[02:46:43] <sney> the invoking user, as in, the one running sudo
[02:46:45] <sney> not the target user
[02:47:13] <sney> so if your user's shell is /bin/bash, you sudo -u www-data -s, you get /bin/bash as www-data
[02:47:40] <dob1> su - user  it's the same as sudo ?
[02:47:46] <xx> I get it now, I thought it would be the target user's /etc/passwd entry
[02:48:11] <xx> thanks
[02:48:22] <xx> dob1: no
[02:48:41] <sney> dob1: su - user is the same as sudo -u user -i
[02:48:49] <xx> sudo, depending on your sudoers file, does extra things such as sanitizing the environment
[02:48:52] <sney> dob1: like the bot says. it helps to test
[02:49:22] <sney> (ok it's not 100% "the same" but it has the same practical result, and you certainly shouldn't use both)
[02:49:45] <xx> it's different enough to lead to unexpected results if the user doesn't know about the difference
[02:51:50] *** Joins: craigevil (~craig@user/craigevil)
[02:52:22] <dob1> sudo -u user -s   while this works even if the user has /bin/false as shell   why su - user -c /bin/bash  doesn't ?
[02:52:22] <sney> I'd buy that for -s, but a login shell should be a login shell regardless of how you got there.
[02:52:56] <sney> dob1: because su - creates a login shell, and that user has no shell
[02:53:03] <sney> sudo -s *does not create a login shell*
[02:53:06] * sney rewinds 
[02:53:27] <sney> sudo -s just runs *your shell* as that user
[02:54:09] * xx copies /bin/bash over /bin/false
[02:54:34] <dob1> sney, I got your point and thanks to point me to do this with sudo without su,  but maybe I am wrong but I was sure I was able to do this with su too even if the user has no shell, maybe I am wrong

[02:58:27] <sney> ah, but you *can* su -s /bin/bash user
[02:59:11] <sney> according to the su man page, -c tries to run a command with the user's shell, which obviously won't do anything if the shell is nologin or false

[06:02:12] <sney> it's evening where I am, and I will be near the computer for the next few hours, though I will gradually get tired and pay less attention
[06:02:23] <wfpkhc> of course i understand
[06:02:36] <sney> but also, I'm not remotely the only person in #debian who knows how to make wifi work on a laptop. if I wander off some other idler will probably be able to help you
[06:02:38] <wfpkhc> to be honest - you have helped me more than you should have
[06:02:49] <wfpkhc> of course
[06:03:04] <wfpkhc> if you do not respond at some point - i understand

[06:19:47] <wfpkhc> tis ok, i need someone to make me look good - it helps my confidence

[06:20:30] <wfpkhc> ok
[06:20:31] <wfpkhc> tghank you
[06:21:26] <wfpkhc> is there any reason i should install the wireless tools?
[06:22:40] <sney> that gives you some utilities like iwconfig and iwlist, they are not 100% needed but can sometimes help for troubleshooting
[06:22:57] <sney> the page is a little outdated, which is understandable since the device is also old
[06:23:48] <wfpkhc> are you kidding - i looked at my chest yesterday, and im starting to get grey hair - IM STARTING to get outdated

[14:17:27] <Khepra> linux audio sucks in general. PA's bad rep mostly originated from the fact that certain distros pushed it out while it was alpha grade

I found the following backport from upstream for ubuntu... https://github.com/lwfinger/rtw89  I'd rather not use ubuntu. not to mention manual modifications of installers is fiddly.

[21:36:36] <sney> #debian only supports debian, sorry
[21:36:54] <codex> sney: ok no problem
[21:37:17] <sney> nemo: debian doesn't use any out-of-tree drivers, so check if it has been accepted into mainline linux
[21:37:57] <nemo> sney: according to that repo it's in-tree

[21:38:17] <sney> ah, I see the readme says it'll be in 5.16. unstable still only has 5.15, but it probably won't be long
[21:38:20] <nemo> ok
[21:38:29] <sney> there isn't a "card list" it's just what's in the kernel

[21:38:49] <sney> nope
[21:38:54] <somiaj> debian does support a few out of tree drivers, but very few and rare (look for dkms packages), but in general it is based on kernel support.

[21:39:42] <somiaj> nemo: debian works on when it is ready time line, so you have to wait until after the kernel releases it (5.16 isn't even released upstream), and then a couple of week to a month to package it
[21:39:50] <nemo> mm
[21:39:56] <sney> you can bookmark this or follow the rss feed on the 'news' panel, https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/linux
[21:40:04] <somiaj> note, it is possible via the linux-headers package to compile your own third party drivers.
[21:40:09] <nemo> yeah ‚òπ
[21:40:19] <sney> but I would guess a month or less based on recent uploads
[21:40:30] <nemo> somiaj: at one point I did a manual "port" of this horrendous thingy for work. "cylance"
[21:40:32] <sney> there's also a 5.16 in experimental, but who knows what's up with that
[21:40:44] <nemo> somiaj: just to satisfy theire requirement of spyware^Wvirus protection in the kernel
[21:40:48] <nemo> but it's painful and I don't wanna
[21:40:57] <nemo> I mean probably easier with them, hopefully no actual code changes
[21:41:07] <nemo> sney: ooooh
[21:41:14] <nemo> sney: if they have an iso, I'll go with it!
[21:41:17] <nemo> that's my level of easy
[21:41:22] <sney> lol
[21:41:25] *** Joins: tieinv (~tieinv@user/tieinv)
[21:41:41] <sney> experimental is a staging area for packages that don't go through the usual migration
[21:41:57] <sney> there is no installer, it's not even a full OS
[21:42:07] <nemo> I wonder if I could take an unstable ISO, and do some brain surgery drop-in of the .16 .deb then
[21:42:16] <nemo> odds are they probably aren't that different ‚ò∫
[21:42:22] <somiaj> packages there are often considered too broken for sid, which is saying something
[21:42:39] <somiaj> though the kernel team will sometimes put prereleases there. Really if you need something that new, I'd build your own kernel
[21:42:44] <sney> yes, when the kernel team puts a package in experimental it's usually because they're testing something weird
[21:42:45] <nemo> plus the rtw89 firmware bin
[21:42:49] <nemo> ew
[21:42:58] <nemo> ok. so might be easier to do my own then
[21:42:58] <sney> just wait
[21:43:20] <nemo> if it's just a couple of weeks, nbd, otherwise might be worth figuring out how to transplant a kernel
[21:43:55] <nemo> !@#$ laptop doesn't even have a cat5 port. ‚òπ  Guess I'd have to buy a USB drive

[21:48:25] <somiaj> also note if you plan to run sid, support is #debian-next on irc.oftc.net. You may have to wait a big longer for the kernel/firmware to make it backports
[21:49:15] <nemo> somiaj: I'll run whatever can actually run, which I guess has to be sid
[21:49:37] <somiaj> many would suggest just wait for the backports. But debian is just a pain on bleeding edge hardware.
[21:49:57] <nemo> somiaj: also, full disclosure, really I was using #debian as an actually-active channel for devuan, since they use 99% debian and don't change the kernel. so. eh. I'm clearly not sane anyway
[21:50:20] <nemo> I've had reasonably good experiences with devuan/debian unstable though
[21:50:24] <nemo> so long as you don't update too often
[21:50:29] <nemo> and watch out what they are updating
[21:50:40] <somiaj> So you are basically leeching support when you clearly know that debian doesn't support derivatives

[21:52:46] <sney> when devuan made their own distro, they also took responsibility for supporting their users. if they can't get it together to do that, welp
[21:52:50] <nemo> sney: and fwiw, the link above to the firmware-realtek was from #devuan - so. cross-fertilization

[21:54:59] <nemo> "how do I install from backports in debian" get that one a lot
[21:55:27] <somiaj> There is a demand for a debian-based support channel, but there isn't one, and this channel is for debian stable.
[21:55:55] <sney> pabs has an ongoing project for more interaction with derivatives, maybe such a channel could be part of that
[21:56:08] <sney> but it would be the wild west with people giving advice that might work or might break something
[21:56:12] <somiaj> The advantage of open source is people can do what they want with it, but if one chooses to use debian as a base to make their own distro, you should use their community for support.
[21:56:29] *** Quits: node1 (~node1@user/node1) (Quit: Client closed)
[21:56:55] <nemo> somiaj: yeah, well devuan is trying fairly hard to be as close to debian as possible it seems. just a thin overlay. but you're right unfortunately the things they remove can absolutely break things. I thought kernel advice would be fine though since they stay 100% on upstream kernel
[21:57:02] <somiaj> yea, so many times we give advice, advice doesn't work, hours later we find out the user isn't even running debian. So it is best to just not support based on debian, and for other distros to foster their own support communities
[21:57:17] <somiaj> that 'thin overlay' changes way more than one may realize.

[22:02:05] <nemo> and then hopefully whole situation resolves itself in a few months for good
