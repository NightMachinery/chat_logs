[20:06:08] <muaddib[m]> Happy thanksgiving folks! Whether you celebrate thanksgiving or not, have a great day.
[20:10:36] <drmpeg[m]> Clayton (@argilo / VE3IRR): I found the bug with the time interleaver. It was something else entirely.
[20:13:37] <drmpeg> The Phase 2 tests are much more comprehensive. I've found other bugs too.
[20:18:05] <drmpeg[m]> The size of the frame mapper block on the GRC canvas is getting  out of control.

[20:38:50] <jholtom> drmpeg: I still like 1920x1080.  It's a good resolution.  But all my monitors are higher already 
[20:39:01] <jholtom> Except the TV
[20:39:10] <jholtom> I'm gonna hang on to that as long as I can
[20:39:25] <ClaytonargiloVE3> drmpeg: Nice! Anything left that needs eyes on it?
[20:39:30] <jholtom> Till someone has good open source firmware for something so it doesn't spy on me or show ads
[20:40:11] <drmpeg> Yeah, I'm loathe to but a smart TV.
[20:40:21] <drmpeg> buy
[20:40:58] <jholtom> Super cool graph though :)
[20:41:08] <drmpeg> Clayton: Everything seems good for now.
[20:42:19] <drmpeg> I think once I run through all the Phase 2 tests, it will be ready for prime time.
