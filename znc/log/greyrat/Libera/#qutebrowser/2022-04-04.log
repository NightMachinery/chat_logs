[00:35:00] <emanuele6> the nm0i link in qute://help/configuring.html is a 404. afaict it has been added directly by The-Compiler with commit a7fb07f, not with a pull request
[00:35:48] <emanuele6> i can't find any contact information (or content) in that me0w.net website

[00:38:45] <mparillo> So for my case, I just would like only the tabs I navigate to actually consume memory when I restore Qutebrowser. I see this issue: https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/4881 but it is closed and I found this: https://www.reddit.com/r/qutebrowser/comments/mgvb81/does_sessionlazy_restore_work_for_you/ which seemed to be my issue, but it references https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5359 and it references qute://warning/
[00:38:47] <mparillo> sessions which seems mostly about losing the back function after a restore.

[00:52:04] <The-Compiler> mparillo: https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5359 is indeed what causes the current implementation of lazy_resture to not work

[12:51:48] <Philipp0205> okay thanks let me try that... 
[12:52:47] <fmartingr> Yeah, that's the issue.
[12:54:26] <il> lol
[12:54:54] <Philipp0205> It was ^^ 
[12:56:47] <fmartingr> I may need to add a warning or something in there for that ^^U
[12:57:57] <Philipp0205> Haha yes. In the usage part "python qute_1pass.py --help" makes it look like one can run it direclty from the terminal 
[12:58:12] <Philipp0205> Thanks for making the script btw appreciate it! 
[12:58:46] <fmartingr> No problem, any problem you have just open an issue at the repository and I will take a look :)

[23:07:49] <megalithic> Good day! Wondering if there is a way to set max_width on individual tabs in the "top" positioned tab bar? the min/max_width i see in docs at the moment seems to only affect the whole tab bar (which makes sense considering the `tabs` notation for that setting)
[23:08:05] <megalithic> Loving this browser, only really discovered Qutebrowser last week.
[23:08:44] <megalithic> Had been (still am) a heavy surfingkeys user for the other browsers, but man, this takes the cake.

[23:17:56] <nytpu> megalithic: afaik there's no way to set the max width on the top tab bar, since the tabs will always split up the entire width of the top bar evenly between them
[23:18:55] <megalithic> fair enough, thanks!
[23:19:02] <megalithic> seemed logical what it's doing, just wanted to verify
[23:19:17] <megalithic> presently trialing left-positioned tab bar
[23:21:14] <nytpu> i definitely prefer the left tab bar
[23:22:22] <nytpu> I have "ttt" and "ttl" bound to switching the tabs to top and left so I can switch between the two, which I do a lot
[23:31:44] <The-Compiler> megalithic: welcome! :)
