[01:20:07] <foo> If I want to ignore/disregard staged files in a repo, I usually do git checkout -- file.txt to do this for one file. What if I want to do this for an entire dir?
[01:21:01] <j416> foo: git checkout -- dir
[01:21:20] <j416> although, not sure what you mean by ignore/disregard.
[01:24:03] <foo> j416: I basically made a bunch of changes in the dir and I want to lose them and undo that
[01:24:08] <foo> j416: I tried that but it didn't seem to work
[01:24:14] <foo> Maybe I have to unstage them first
[01:24:27] <j416> if you unstage them, you lose the changes you staged
[01:24:44] <j416> if your work dir files look different than those staged
[01:24:46] <foo> Yup, had to first do git restore --staged web-files/
[01:24:58] <foo> j416: yeah, that's ok, I copied from another dir prematurely
[01:25:28] <j416> I prefer a workflow where I commit things I want to keep, then I can safely reset away anything else in whatever way without worrying about anything
[01:25:41] <j416> committed things are safe
[01:26:01] <j416> uncommitted things are easy to overwrite by mistake
[01:26:27] <foo> j416: yeah. Only issue now is I copied over a new dir, so I see it in Untracked files. I imagine my solution there is simply to rm -fr the dir?
[01:26:36] <foo> (I realize what I'm doing requires extra care
[01:26:48] <j416> git doesn't care about untracked files

[07:58:42] <Bruce44> Hi, I am wondering do you guys prefer using merge or rebase ? My colleagues require me using rebase only, but in some scenarios I guess merge is much more straightforward
[07:58:51] *** Joins: pony (~ed@168.138.14.60)
[08:00:21] <elibrokeit> Bruce44: I suppose that depends what you mean by "merge"
[08:00:48] <elibrokeit> you can rebase, then merge via a merge commit instead of fast-forward
[08:01:19] <elibrokeit> for large changes encompassing many commits, that might be desirable
[08:01:48] *** Joins: jaggz (~jaggz@user/jaggz)
[08:01:58] <jaggz> if I did git init . and added some files, then cloned that to another computer
[08:02:00] <jaggz> without --bare
[08:02:12] <elibrokeit> this is independent of the fact that rebasing is useful, because it lets you check that the changes apply on the latest version, and makes bisect more useful
[08:02:14] <jaggz> what's the proper way to update it so I don't get this, on the remote clone: 'error: By default, updating the current branch in a non-bare repository remote: is denied,'
[08:02:43] <elibrokeit> jaggz: can you just re-clone it using --bare?
[08:02:56] <jaggz> elibrokeit, not sure. don't want to accidentally wipe things either
[08:03:15] <elibrokeit> did you develop in the version cloned to another computer?
[08:03:20] <jaggz> yeah, both
[08:03:46] <jaggz> what's going on here anyway?  looks like you should have a repo that's not a working tree (you're not working in it directly) for multiple systems to commit to.. ?
[08:04:09] <jaggz> (that doesn't have a working tree*)
[08:04:20] <elibrokeit> and you don't have a third computer, like e.g. one being operated by Github or Gitlab or sourcehut or a private cgit server or something, which is used for central staging?
[08:04:46] <jaggz> no.  although I do have some of my other repos in proper "bare" (I guess) repositories, with multiple checkouts
[08:05:06] <jaggz> just using git+ssh between systems to access them
[08:05:39] <jaggz> so I think the proper way is to move this to a separate repo and both systems work from it.. so how do I make that dedicated central repo?
[08:06:18] <jaggz> I mean, I have a lot of projects that I just "git init ." in, and might then want to clone and work on them from multiple (two) systems
[08:06:18] <elibrokeit> git clone --bare to a third system or to a second directory on one of the first two systems :p
[08:06:50] <elibrokeit> then add that as a remote to both, and push/pull from there (treating it exactly like some treat their github repo copies)
[08:07:33] <elibrokeit> if you'd like to live super dangerously, you could do git config receive.denyCurrentBranch false/ignore/warn
[08:07:48] <jaggz> git remote set-url origin git+ssh://jaggz@192.168.1.15:/path/repos/new-bare-project.git ?
[08:08:13] <elibrokeit> but then pushing to the other system might nuke your current work and mess with the index/HEAD/working tree state sync
[08:08:22] <elibrokeit> sure, I guess
[08:08:29] <jaggz> where I cd'ed /path/repos/new-bare-project && git clone --bare /home/jaggz/projects/new-bare-project
[08:08:59] <jaggz> ... --bare /home/jaggz/projects/old-non-bare-project :)
[08:09:03] <elibrokeit> you could even install cgit and run it on 192.168.1.15 and all of a sudden you have your own self-hosted github alternative ;)
[08:09:25] <jaggz> hmmm

[18:27:52] <cehteh> git cant look into the future :D .. but you can make branches for other PR's and then merge or rebase your own stuff on it, while other PR's may have conflicts between them or the merging maintainer may decide that something needs to be changed, i'd rather suggest you just stay retro-active, whenever your PR fails to merge in master/devel or whatever you update it, github shows that and may even notify you

[18:43:02] <elibrokeit> IIRC the ...../merge ref will only exist if the PR is still open/unmerged but don't quote me on that, my fetch refspec drops /merge and maps /head to refs/pull/<num>

[18:51:43] <elibrokeit> inkbottle[m]: that's because git-dir specifies the location of the .git/ directory, not the location of the repo as a whole. Try -C instead.
[18:52:15] <elibrokeit> That is like make -C dir/ and chdirs first
[18:52:35] <inkbottle[m]> Thanks, will try that.
[18:53:01] <inkbottle[m]> In the meanwhile I also found something there: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1386291/git-git-dir-not-working-as-expected
[18:53:49] <inkbottle[m]> They suggest to use `--work-tree` simultaneously to `--git-dir`, and that did do the trick.
[18:55:00] <inkbottle[m]> Now reading the manual about `-C`.
[18:55:46] <elibrokeit> You could manually and painfully use both git-dir and work-tree but I advise against it unless you are a masochist
[18:55:56] <elibrokeit> -C does both at the same time :)

[19:43:22] <elibrokeit> I assumed the refs/pull/*/merge commits would *not* be outdated as their entire point is to represent merging the commit into master.
[19:43:44] <elibrokeit> Hi-Angel1: you can't make --stat do something other than stat!
[19:43:51] <elibrokeit> But you can use --stat --summary
[19:44:39] <Hi-Angel1> elibrokeit: I'm not sure adding `--summary` changed anything
[19:44:42] <squirrel> elibrokeit: if a file was changed on master it will be in the diff even if the PR does not affect it

[19:45:55] <elibrokeit> squirrel: if you're diffing master against the ***merge commit*** then it should be the difference between master and merging the PR, i.e. "only what merging the PR will change".
[19:46:34] <elibrokeit> But I could be completely misremembering what the /merge ref does...
[19:46:41] <elibrokeit> Since I never pull those :p
[19:50:56] <Hi-Angel1> Ah, I realized, the `git diff HEAD~3.. --stat` works! So, instead of `git-log` you use git diff with `--stat` option
[19:53:34] <elibrokeit> Well, if you want the diffstat between two commits, not the log between two commits with the per commit diffstat, then yes you'll need to use diff instead of log
[19:53:43] <elibrokeit> I guess I misunderstood the question

[20:41:54] <thiago> that commit (I assume from GitHub) was probably current when the PR was opened
[20:41:54] <elibrokeit> Well, there are git refspec signifiers to select the merge base of the merge commit. So at least it is possible to tell via that merge commit, what the actual commit diff of the PR is.
[20:42:03] <thiago> always merge again to your current branch tip before testing
[20:42:29] <thiago> and don't let the PR stay open for more than 2 days after it's been tested. If that happens, test again.
[20:42:37] <elibrokeit> thiago: yes, but if github isn't going to keep the /merge ref up to date there's zero point in them creating it to begin with, users can handle merging themselves just fine anyway
[20:42:52] <thiago> agreed
[20:42:53] <thiago> they should
[20:43:21] <thiago> ignore the merge commit GH created and merge directly the PR tip
[20:43:42] <elibrokeit> The question under discussion isn't about merging anything.

[20:44:00] <elibrokeit> It's about programmatically checking every open PR by someone else to yet another person's repo
