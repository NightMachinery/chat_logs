[00:58:45] <OnkelTem> I need to write a parser for strings of a simple pseudo-language. Is there something what I can use for that?
[00:59:31] <systemfault> People usually pick something like peg.js
[00:59:45] <OnkelTem> Say my string can look like: item item,item,(item item,item,(item item))

The president of Turkey announced a ban on purchasing USD. The next day people sold a lot of USD and bought TRY. The rate dropped from 1 USD to 11 TRY today. <-- it seems beneficial for the country. TRY got its strength back

[05:13:30] <Voxel> I'm curious why fetch() doesn't support porgress yet. Is that related to Promise and its semi-callback functionality (resolve, reject) which is final when returned? What if fetch would have an additional callback parameter in addition to promise which would trigger on each data state change. I'm not an expert, though..

[05:27:48] <systemfault> If you can make those arrays "sets"... then it could be faster.
[05:32:31] <Intelo> systemfault ok but sets can't have duplicates. [1,2,2] != [1,2]
[05:32:36] <Intelo> so sets will fail
[05:32:47] <systemfault> Intelo: I can't magically guess your requirements.
[05:32:57] <systemfault> But yes, it won't work
[05:34:13] <Intelo> I disagree with the example #2. The longest substring is `w` which is appearing 3 times. not `wke`. Am I missing anything here? https://youtu.be/sydRChyHRxk?t=72

[05:38:03] <Intelo> systemfault this means you also agree with me:)  ?
[05:38:04] <systemfault> It asks for the longest substring without repeating characters...
[05:38:40] <systemfault> In example 3, it can be either wke or kew
[05:39:02] <Intelo> Hm.. I see
[05:40:20] <Intelo> systemfault but in example #1 `abc` is repeating 2 times
[05:40:38] <systemfault> without REPEATING CHARACTERS
[05:40:44] <Intelo> ex #2 `b` is repeating 5 times
[05:40:59] <Intelo> what would that mean?
[05:41:05] <systemfault> Are you having a hard time with simple english?
[05:41:13] <Intelo> I think that's the issue here.
[05:41:32] <Intelo> whats a repeating char here?
[05:41:34] <systemfault> ab is valid, aa is not valid
[05:41:59] <Intelo> so repeating char 'side by side'?
[05:42:02] <systemfault> Yes
[05:42:18] <systemfault> They ask for substrings, so it's implied
[05:42:31] <Intelo> abcabcbbb is valid for 'abc' but   aaabbbcccaaabbbcccxxxxx is not valid for aaabbbccc ?
[05:43:15] <Intelo> is that what 'repeating chars' mean
[05:43:19] <systemfault> abc are all different characters and are a substring
[05:43:33] <systemfault> "abc" is a valid substring of "abcabcbbb"
[05:43:41] <Intelo> ok
[05:43:47] <Intelo> what about the other
[05:44:01] <systemfault> If you have aaabbbcccaaabbbcccxxxxx
[05:44:24] <systemfault> Then "ab" is valid "bc" is valid "ca" is valid "cx" is valid

[06:41:14] <Intelo> oh wait.
[06:41:18] <ljharb> Intelo: i used parens to coerce the initial value to zero, and then i added one
[06:41:42] <ljharb> Intelo: to me it's clearer, because it highlights the important part, the +1, and it groups the part that's only relevant when it's undefined
[06:41:43] <Intelo> ok got it.

[06:42:27] <Intelo> ljharb yes its clearer
[06:42:32] <ljharb> seemed simpler, i guess
[06:42:44] <ljharb> imo the ternary hides the fact that you're always adding one
[06:42:57] <Intelo> so syntax / visibility / clarity of code were the reasons alone?
[06:42:58] <ljharb> it's the zero that's the implicit initial value, not the 1

[06:43:30] <ljharb> outside of interviews, hardly at all
[06:43:37] <ljharb> closer to "never" than anything else

[06:44:39] <Intelo> I also wonder why algos are the first gate to pass in interviews usually
[06:44:43] <ljharb> i find that "making actual things that matter" do that more efficiently
[06:46:07] <Intelo> ljharb isn't that the step 2,3,4  (libs, system design etc)
[06:46:21] <Intelo> ---> I also wonder why algos are the first gate to pass in interviews usually
[06:47:11] <Intelo> gate > 1 will fail if gate 1 is weak   <-- I thought but I don't know
[06:47:32] <Intelo> gate 1 here is algos and data structures etc

[06:55:01] <ljharb> Intelo: practice is fine, but it shouldn't really require it? it's just a puzzle
[06:55:31] <ljharb> Intelo: i'm not saying algo knowledge is bad. i'm saying that overindexing on anything is bad, and also that adding "gates" is usually wildly inefficient
[06:55:43] <ljharb> Intelo: and, i'm saying that no traditional CS knowledge, whatsoever, is *necessary*
[06:55:50] <ljharb> Intelo: which means, "CS stuff" should never be a gate.
[06:56:06] <ljharb> i mean, except that if someone claims expertise you can test them on it

[08:18:06] <jellobot> (fail) TypeError: TextDecoder.decode is not a constructor
[08:18:18] <stenno> n> (new TextDecoder()).decode((new TextEncoder()).encode('\xf3\xe0').map((char) => char % 128))
[08:18:19] <jellobot> (okay) 'C3C '
[08:18:48] <stenno> ok
[08:19:05] <stenno> so i guess i just use new Uint8Array([...str])
[08:19:43] <Decker> that won't work :)
[08:19:54] <Decker> str will have 256+ characters
[08:20:42] <Decker> really shouldn't use string at all until you're very done but thenthat's what textdecoder is for (once you hvae valid utf8 encodings)
[08:21:09] <stenno> hmmm
[08:21:39] <stenno> that shouldn't be a problem actually
[08:21:49] *** KevChang is now known as KevChang2020
[08:22:09] <stenno> also uh, can the constructor only accept arrays up to 255 items?
[08:22:41] <stenno> or what do you mean with your statement about 256+
[08:23:21] <Decker> well maybe not given your input... how are you getting the 437 data?
[08:23:36] <stenno> i parse it from a file
[08:23:55] <stenno> VT100 ttyrec to be precise
[08:24:07] <Decker> and are you putting it back out to a file?

[08:24:28] <Decker> (not that that matters I guess) ... so isn't it already in a uint8array from the file?
[08:24:37] <stenno> yes
[08:24:50] <Decker> then you dont need [...str] ?
[08:25:00] <stenno> i am currently refactoring the code so that i can make a transformation before using TextDecoder

[08:26:08] <Decker> I see; I have just this array of 128 characters for 128-255; and those each result in some amount of bytes; so I go through the file first and count how many bytes I'll need to replace the single bytes with byte sequences and then allocate a new uint8array for that size
[08:26:09] <EdFletcher> i read a great article recently that articulated why bare "for" loops are inferior as a construct to the functional interfaces because they're too powerful, but i can't find the link! anyone know what i might be talking about?

[10:37:45] <Voxel> Or, how would you tell the caller that constructor failed. !new Class1(data) doesn't actually work since "return" in constructor return this if the return value is not an object.
[10:38:13] <Voxel> returns 'this'*
[10:40:03] <Voxel> The main issue is to verify that contructor succeded in a statement like if (!new Class1(data)) return false.
[10:41:40] <han-solo> are you doing some processing inside constructor ? i wonder if throwing exception from constructor is a good idea, since constructors are just supposed to setup stuff ?

[14:30:07] <pingpongball> i've those things in the for loop that i'm putting into
[14:30:09] <pingpongball> like for eg
[14:31:20] <pingpongball> `["user1": ["col1", 23, "col2":44 , "col3":"55"],   "user2": ["col1": 223, "col2": 99]]`
[14:31:35] <pingpongball> but they are in for loop like
[14:32:02] *** Joins: voltage (voltage@user/voltage)
[14:32:17] <pingpongball> `for ({userid, colid, number)){}`

[14:32:30] <pingpongball> and they may contain duplicate userid and colid too.
[14:33:40] <pingpongball> so when adding , i should be careful like if duplicate userid came, then i should append the colid's
[14:33:44] <pingpongball> Is there any way?
[14:36:14] <han-solo> check if id exists and just update ? `values = dict.get(userid); if (values.length) { dict.set(userid, [...values, ...newvalues]; }` // ?

[14:54:43] <Decker> well; it doesn't have set and get... but ( thing in object ) works for checking if exists

[14:57:53] <pingpongball> so you mean there is no difference on using `new Map()` and `{}`

[14:58:59] <Decker> but effectively no it's just also an {} implemented internally
[15:00:18] <Decker> pingpongball so back at your original data line example, you can just replace the array container with an object; (although array can also be assigned named fields, it's not like keeping a count of things so it's working outside of what an array is meant to be)

[17:19:03] <halt> name suggest rsa ) I got the inputs, but I can't replicate it, so my question is, how can I trace the function which calculate the csrf value, as I'm getting lost between cross referenced files, and public and private classes and other magic which unfortunately make no sense to me.

[20:08:27] <mikrosis> I finally got the React context provider declared and it wraps the whole App as the whole App should use that context.
[20:08:40] <mikrosis> the context provider itself also got an "addToCart" function as value/prop.

[23:11:00] <chazy> hi, does anyone know how swiper.js works? i'm trying to make the autoplay stop at a certain index using slideTo() but i can't make it work
[23:11:43] <silly> ping
[23:12:33] <chazy> first i start the autoplay, then a setTimeOut and a callback to stop the autoplay and slideTo the given index

[23:51:38] <chazy> hmm why do functions/callbacks get called immediately when i want to pass arguments depending where i put them? like addEventListener() doesn't call the callback but setTimeOut() does, why's that? how do i know when that happens?

[23:54:12] <CoderCharmander> chazy: You're not actually making a callback function, you're evaluating myFunc('abc'), then passing the result to setTimeout.
[23:55:03] <CoderCharmander> To make an anonymous function that calls myFunc('abc'), write () => myFunc('abc')
[23:55:25] <chazy> can i put that inside setTimeOut()?
[23:55:30] <CoderCharmander> Yes

[23:56:14] <CoderCharmander> So it's setTimeout(() => myFunc('abc'), 1000)
[23:57:24] *** Quits: wroathe (~wroathe@user/wroathe) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:57:37] <CoderCharmander> The () => is the syntax to create an anonymous function: a function that does not have a name but can be passed around to be called by others
[23:58:49] <chazy> that works perfectly, thanks
