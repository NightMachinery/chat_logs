[01:01:04] <Khepra> you can always set serial options to the kernel cmdline even if you don't use it, thus you can set it via /etc/default/grub, no need to script anything for grub

[02:37:59] <dadinn> mattb0ne: personally I think nobody should use partition. Either use swapfiles, or use LVM. Also, you definitely want to encrypt your swapspace, so it should be on top of a LUKS device, for which the two options are either as a file, or as an LVM volume.
[02:38:16] <Khepra> only if the paged out memory is needed to be paged back in. just "anything" hitting swap needn't affect performance at all
[02:38:16] <dadinn> sorry, use partition for swapspace.

[02:40:35] <dadinn> alternatively, you can use ZFS for root filesystem and a volume for swapspace. It even has built-in encryption
[02:40:41] <Khepra> sometimes partitions is the only thing you can use for swap

[03:20:27] <xx> it mainly helps when one wants to replicate the root dir / to someplace, like a backup, because it will not replicate /swapfile since that's in a different subvolume

[12:25:55] <pingpongball> Dear fathers, son, daughers, wives, husbands, ......
[12:26:20] <pingpongball> How can i switch between proprietary nvidia drivers and opensource nvidia drivers in one command or easily?
[12:26:50] <pingpongball> I heard optimus / bumblebee but their documentation is hard to read
[12:27:14] <Khepra> that's two different but related questions
[12:27:33] <pingpongball> would be great like apt switch opensource-nvidia-drivers or apt switch proprietary-nvidia-drivers like things
[12:27:35] <pingpongball> Thank you
[12:28:04] <Khepra> to switch betweeen them you just apt install or remove nvidia-drivers (and its dkms and other dependencies), the packaging is configured to disable nouveau when proprietary is installed
[12:28:25] <Khepra> *nvidia-driver
[12:29:45] <Khepra> to deal with optimus/bumblebee, I have no idea. there's wiki but there's also agony, pain, eyes rolled, tables flipped... to get that working.  https://wiki.debian.org/Bumblebee ;;  https://wiki.debian.org/NVIDIA%20Optimus

[12:46:30] <Khepra> pingpongball: just to be on the same page, optimus/bumblebee is about switching on/off of  nvidia and INTEL  ; are you asking about that when you say "switching"?
[12:47:08] <Khepra> or are you asking about nouveau/nvidia-dkms  as one question, and then optimus/bumblebee as another?
[12:47:12] <pingpongball> =L  oh , that means, my question is different not about optimus , but rather nvidia related.
[12:47:28] <pingpongball> no i'm asking about nouveau/nvidia-dkms question

[12:47:50] <Khepra> pingpongball: okay. so that has nothing to do with optimus/bumblebee. you "switch" by installing or removing the proprietary driver.
[12:48:50] <Khepra> if it were only about the kmod, you could easily blacklist one or the other via /etc/modprobe.d/...   but it's not just kmod, it's xorg modules, opengl libs (proprietary vs mesa), and it's a bit more involved, if at all possible due to xorg autodetection
[12:48:54] <pingpongball> but it is so hassle to do that, like if i want to use proprietary i will download that 1 gb like so file and again to use opensource remove and using this 1 2 times a day is not great idea.

[13:09:37] <Khepra> in general there shouldn't be any. some games might behave poorly over xwayland, but taht's probably insignificant compared to how poorly nouveau would work for games.

[14:05:49] <Khepra> anyone else feeling dirty when they talk about how to use WINDOWS.... in #debian... LEGITIMATELY... ie. it's actually ontopic... because that's how perverse that whole WSL business is.

[14:12:30] <Khepra> oerheks: I thought WSL2 was just a form of virtualization, full linux kernel working in it? thus, xorg too? no?
[14:12:53] <Khepra> unlike WSL1 which was basically a WINE-like bash environment inside which one could run glibc linked programs.
[14:12:56] <oerheks> Khepra, no xorg, but programs should work fine, with their gui
[14:13:10] <jokoon> how can I know where apt installed a library?
[14:13:40] <Khepra> oerheks: how does that work? since gui programs require either xorg or wayland bindings and libraries.
[14:14:23] <oerheks> clearly it uses the windows thingy, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps

[14:26:03] <amacater_> My guess is that most things debian are on topic here briefly for redirection - redirection has happened twice in the comments above
[14:28:16] <amacater_> There is an update coming - Windows 10 21H2 - due now-ish - should make running a GUI significantly easier but will require files from testing/backports to work well - see #debian-wsl on OFTC
[14:29:25] <xx> gdb doesn't have a function where I could point it to some symbol server that debian provides?
[14:29:37] <xx> I actually have to install the debugging symbols for every package?
[14:31:20] <amacater_> xx: I think that's the case - it's probably more straightforward to do that anyway - and will be kept up to date as packages change. The majority of users don't need debug info and those that do might not want to call out to servers so local packages are one answer

[16:25:16] <mattb0ne> i am trying to put debian 11 on my new SSD
[16:26:58] <mattb0ne> i was having problems with debian 10 something the AER system bombing with an error, anyways I was able to see it bios and windows 11 was able to install no problem. I made a debian 11 install usb and went through the installation my problem is when i go to reboot to finish the install i get a blue screen sayin my windows OS needs to be recovered
[16:27:19] <mattb0ne> i am not looking to dual boot and I put debian on the entire disk
[16:28:41] <jkc> You may or may not need to disable secure boot, first of all. Second, see if your UEFI menu has an option to select an alternate boot loader. Third, you may need to tell the installer to format the EFI system partition.

[16:30:35] <mattb0ne> I have secure boot disabled and I cannot select a boot loader
[16:30:58] <mattb0ne> how can I tell debian to format the EFI system
[16:31:53] <mattb0ne> partition i do not see it. I am running the install again last time I just deleted everything untill all i saw was the 1.9 TB disk though the full size is 1.92
[16:32:08] <mattb0ne> is there a possibility that the efi partition is hidden from the debian install
[16:32:22] <Khepra> mattb0ne: the installer does that by default. what kind of partitioning did you choose in the installer?
[16:32:44] <Khepra> mattb0ne: nope. the ESP must be clearly visible, labeled, and FAT32 filesystem'd. can't be encrypted or any other trickery used
[16:33:07] <Khepra> (by labeled I mean flagged as "esp" ; I don't mean GPT labels)
[16:34:06] <jkc> "flagged as ESP" means that its partition type is set appropriately.
[16:34:51] <jkc> And I think that if there's already an ESP, the installer doesn't format it?
[16:34:57] <jkc> I seem to remember that, but I could be mistaken.
[16:35:37] <Khepra> hrm that's possible, yes
[16:36:09] <Khepra> mattb0ne: in which case... maybe you don't need any reinstallation. reboot, and in your BIOS/EFIrmware choose BOOT options. hitting F12 or F8 would get you there right after POST
[16:36:35] <Khepra> then see if EFIrmware lists multiple operating systems, being that it has windows and debian EFI stubs/loaders on the ESP
[16:36:59] <Khepra> then choose debian. then optionally remove the windows entry from the ESP, once you boot into debian
[16:39:34] <mattb0ne> ok let me try that
[16:40:53] <mattb0ne> EFIrmware is different from grub right?
[16:41:47] <Khepra> EFIrmware is the baked in, EFI firmware, the thing that used to be BIOS. the F in UEFI
[16:42:21] <Khepra> yeah, it's the hardware baked code that seeks the ESP on disk, launches the stubs/loaders, which in case of debian is grub, that then picks up regular grubb-y functions.
[16:43:26] <Khepra> EFIrmware is a term I coined because I don't like acronym redundancy. Extensible Firmware Interface Firmware would be something from the redundancy department of redundancy.

[16:44:15] <Khepra> which is exactly wy I call it EFIrmware, because EFI itself is _interface_
[16:44:36] <jkc> I think you're splitting hairs in incorrect ways.
[16:44:46] <jkc> I'd just stick to the actual acronyms and not try to invent your own because reasons.
[16:44:53] <Khepra> acronyms for what exactly?
[16:45:03] <Khepra> how do you call the code that executes when you hit F8 during boot?
[16:45:28] <Khepra> that ain't EFI as EFI is a specification
[16:45:35] <Khepra> well.. UEFI is
[16:45:53] <Khepra> so how does one call UEFI implementation software?

[21:58:22] <mattb0n> i am getting a lot of spam from the AER
[21:58:29] <onto> so out of the box, you cant install apps because you need sudo axx, you don't have sudo axx, to add your self to the sudo file you need sudo axx
[21:58:37] <onto> this is a very miserable experience for a new user

[21:59:10] <cryptikulous> try su
[21:59:18] <cryptikulous> did you set a root password at some point?
[21:59:33] <onto> yes during install
[21:59:40] <onto> su looks like what i wanted :)
[21:59:53] <cryptikulous> then edit the file
[22:00:03] <onto> btw
[22:00:29] <onto> if i can su when i need to is there any point adding the user to the sudoers file?
[22:00:39] <cryptikulous> well yes
[22:00:45] <cryptikulous> you can then lock out the root user

[22:53:16] <onto> cya
[22:53:16] <espero> PerfDave, it's normal it tiries to log you in automatically by opening a link in your default web browser which points to discord which then sends the app your credentials so you don't have to enter your password
[22:53:25] *** Parts: onto (~onto@45.63.115.64) ()
[22:53:29] <PerfDave> Personally I use KDE, I find it nicer than Gnome.
[22:53:44] <n4dir> gnome sure is ... an experience
[22:53:51] <PerfDave> espero: Well, I find it creepy. I would have preferred it explained that to me before doing it.
[22:54:06] <euouae> I'm using gnome. I don't use its features, it stays out of my way and that's okay :)
[22:54:27] <espero> I mostly use either GNOME or KDE but rn i'm writing this from dwm.exe
[22:54:46] <n4dir> euouae: i sure dont doubt that, but if you run it it, it is a bit difficult. Not very intutitive
[22:55:11] <PerfDave> Gnome is reminiscent of MacOS, KDE of Windows
[22:55:18] <PerfDave> In their default configs
[22:55:19] <euouae> n4dir I think gnome's vision is to copy apple's authoritative UI
[22:55:38] <euouae> you have no choices, you just accept the defaults, which hopefully are intuitive
[22:55:49] <euouae> and you sort of discover the features while using it
[22:56:03] <n4dir> perhaps. Just saying i got really hard times with it. So i can understand people first being a bit confused. Nothing you couldn't get sorted in a few days, of course
[22:56:18] <euouae> mhmm got you
[22:56:24] <espero> although KDE reminds of Windows in its default config, it could be customized so that it looks even more macOS-ish (or however they changed their capitalization last time) than GNOME
[22:56:29] <n4dir> most of my hardware can't handle it, so that is really my problem (else i would use it more often)
[22:57:20] <espero> I literally run GNOME because it's the default in the distro I use so yeah
[22:57:32] <n4dir> enlightenment, i still call it e17, is also ... interesting.
[22:57:35] <espero> and I don't thing I even have a piece of hardware which is unable to run GNOME
[22:57:40] <euouae> n4dir that's why I'm so happy about debian installed on that imac. I tried other distros but the graphical installation would not load, or crashed
[22:58:05] <euouae> I think I only tried the ubuntu variants
[22:58:05] <n4dir> euouae: yup, i see. Same here. I pretty much could put debian on *anything*
[22:58:10] <espero> even my phone is capable of running it (albeit I haven't tried it yet)
[22:58:41] <n4dir> and most of the times it runs better than distros which claim to be ressource friendly
[22:58:47] <espero> For me debian is THE rock solid distribution that you install once and then forget about maintenance for a couple of years
[22:58:59] <n4dir> yup.
[22:59:56] <n4dir> espero: there is that old speech of a debian dev, "who the bloody hell cares about debian". I like that a lot
[23:00:09] <n4dir> nothing that new to anyone, but still interesting and nice
[23:00:18] <espero> like I installed debian onto my grandma's PC and she is pretty much happy with daily-driving it up to this day even without migrating to a later version (afaik she still runs Jessie but I'm not sure)
[23:00:37] <euouae> I want to get more involved into linux sometime soon but later in my life
[23:00:48] <euouae> the whole development process. Sure I can't be a kernel dev but there may be something I can do
[23:00:59] <espero> there is a cron job that installs security updates once a week but that's all needed to keep the system running with latest security fixes
[23:01:07] <euouae> so for now I'm trying out distros and seeing what feels like a nice place to join
[23:01:27] <espero> on my personal machines I prefer using something more bleeding-edge, like Fedora and OpenSUSE
[23:02:06] <n4dir> i kinda liked Void-Linux, but it's repositories are bit small
[23:02:11] <PerfDave> espero: If she's still running Jessie, that cron job isn't installing security updates :)
[23:02:37] <n4dir> if more bleeding was needed, i'd probably go for Sid though :-)
[23:02:47] <espero> yeah, maybe, I haven't touched that machine in like 4 years already xd

[23:02:54] * n4dir posts this from debian old-stable. ha ha
[23:02:55] <espero> but it still works
[23:03:13] <euouae> how long will the current debian-stable last before it's not getting security updates?
[23:03:17] <PerfDave> I tend to run Debian Stable on my systems because I don't want to have to care about stuff breaking underneath me.
[23:03:19] <euouae> Just to have a good idea about when to update my friends computer
[23:03:28] <PerfDave> euouae: Traditionally, a year after the *next* stable is released.

[23:06:30] <espero> even our school's IT department is trying to persuade the teachers that using FOSS software is better but the teachers don't seem to care about it at all
[23:06:33] <xx> espero: so run windows in a virtual machine, instead of the other way round
[23:06:38] <xx> don't give windows hardware access
[23:06:48] <n4dir> damn teachers. so stupid
[23:06:58] <xx> most teachers never heard of linux
[23:07:40] <n4dir> thats what i said :-)
[23:08:31] <espero> xx, I literally have a dedicated laptop for Windows but I can't live without having Linux so I run Linux on WSL here
[23:09:23] <xx> one day I'll create a software that lets you run different operating systems at the same time on the same machine, and you switch them by some special key combo, but that day is not today

[23:11:41] <euouae> You can see what it looks like here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xen#/media/File:Xen_screenshot.png
[23:13:42] <xx> euouae: I'm thinking of a more advanced version, where the operating systems don't even know they are running as a VM and see all the hardware directly
[23:14:25] <xx> hence being able to use nvidia drivers in windows while at the same time running nouveau in linux, and both executing graphics intensive stuff
[23:14:36] <espero> so you just have three physcical machines and switch the OSes by switching the monitor input device
[23:14:51] <silly> i've read somewhere about a board or laptop with both, an x86 and an arm cpu
[23:14:56] <xx> espero: yeah, my way would be a way of doing that with a single machine
[23:14:57] *** Quits: tesseract (~tesseract@user/tesseract) (Quit: tesseract)
[23:15:21] <xx> it is doable, but very very hard, haven't seen anyone attempt it beyond some trivial stuff in academia
[23:16:38] <espero> I don't think it's doable at all since different OSes often require different firmware to be loaded into various devices like GPUs or Ethernet cards

[23:19:37] <cheapie> xx: The DM&P Vortex86EX2 CPU can actually do some of what you're saying (it has two cores that run completely independently of each other) but it's... not fast.
[23:20:53] <cheapie> I think the intended use for that one is embedded systems, with a full OS (maybe Debian! :P) running some UI thing, alongside some RTOS actually controlling the machine or whatever it's actually in.
[23:22:03] <xx> espero: devices can be reset, firmware loaded & unloaded, and so on. Doable, but very complex.

[23:38:00] <cheapie> aivkiv: I wanna say it was like 7 or 8, maybe 9 at the latest? It is possible to turn it off if it's causing problems for you somehow.
[23:39:04] <aivkiv> cheapie, was it always on by default?
[23:39:24] <cheapie> IIRC the default has been on since it was introduced.
[23:40:51] <cheapie> On one hand it would be nice if it could somehow automatically determine how fast the CPU is and automatically adjust the threshold at which it just downloads the full list, but on the other hand it's not like I can really expect Debian 11 to run well on a 20-year-old computer regardless, so *shrug*
