[20:07:01] <moo> i'm just not sure i should give hostnames to all those moving parts i have that need to see each other
[20:07:31] <rawtaz> moo: why would you set the hostname? are you not using compose?
[20:07:43] <moo> i am using compose
[20:08:05] <moo> actually multiple compose files, and they need to see each other in some way
[20:08:07] <rawtaz> great. all your services (containers) in that compose app can resolve/reach each other using their service names as the FQDN when connecting
[20:08:18] <moo> ah i see
[20:08:36] <moo> but using multiple compose files i use hostname to reach them, is that ok? 
[20:08:37] <rawtaz> a service in one compose can reach the other one by <compose project name>_<service name in there>_<number>. but then you might want to set the hostname instead, yes.
[20:08:41] <rawtaz> but thats just for internal connections.
[20:08:54] <moo> ooh i'll test that, thanks 
[20:09:09] <rawtaz> if you publish a port for a service on the host then whatever connects to that should of course connect to the host's IP or hostname. that has nothing to do with the hostnames in the compose app

[20:51:51] <s33ker> maybe i cant make subdirectories just files ?
[20:52:20] <s33ker> if i restart the one where i made subdirectories ?
[20:52:32] <rawtaz> then one where you are not seeing the directories.
[20:52:51] <s33ker> hm ok let me stop it and start it again
[20:55:14] <s33ker> hmm stopped started same hmm
[20:56:09] <rawtaz> in that case you should probably make a pastebin where you show the exact commands how you start/run those containers, as well as show how you create the directories and how you try to view them in each container.
[20:56:27] <rawtaz> might start with the first part, the commands
[20:56:37] <s33ker> ok one sec
[20:57:01] <rawtaz> if its just two commands you can put them in here on two lines, thats fine
[20:57:06] <s33ker> docker run --name test3 --network algotrade -it -v ScriptVolume alpine:latest
[20:58:01] <maya-r> I think I found a matching bug for my problem, hurray! https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/42680
[20:58:32] <s33ker> rawtaz just made another container and the volume is empty here aswell
[20:59:09] <rawtaz> s33ker: you only pasted one command when you were supposed to paste two. why?
[20:59:40] *** Quits: optiz0r_ (~quassel@lenore.sihnon.net) (Quit: http://quassel-irc.org - Chat comfortably. Anywhere.)
[20:59:41] <s33ker> i made another container with the same command and different name
[20:59:49] <s33ker> if that is what you mean
[21:00:01] <rawtaz> s33ker: doesnt matter *at all*. if we agreed that you should paste the two commands you used to start the two containers, then thats what you do.
[21:00:09] <rawtaz> otherwise youre just wasting people's time, to be frank.
[21:00:30] <rawtaz> theres *nothing* worse than not getting the information one ask for when one is trying to help someone. we dont ask for specific information just because it's fun..
[21:00:33] * rawtaz sighs
[21:00:35] <s33ker> sorry man that was not my intention but i dont know how i created the first container it was 6h ago

[21:01:04] <s33ker> should have told you that but i cant see the command i created it that is why i told you i just made another one with the same command
[21:01:06] <ada_> if you don't have the command that you used to run the container, you can show "docker inspect" which will have the description of your volumes you have mounted
[21:01:07] <rawtaz> you usually have command history, but okay, we'll have to live without that first one
[21:01:20] <ada_> use a pastebin type service so all the info is together
[21:01:23] <ada_> and not in the chat channel
[21:01:40] <s33ker> i get it it was just this command to start with
[21:02:10] <s33ker> anyway what do you think ?
[21:02:14] <s33ker> good so far ?

[21:02:32] <rawtaz> unless im misreading https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#choose-the--v-or---mount-flag the way i understand it is that if you just give one single argument to -v then that will become the *mount point* inside the container, and the volume will be an anonymous one. doesnt that then mean that you dont have the same volume for your two containers (instead each have their own anonymous one)?
[21:02:53] <rawtaz> if i were to create a volume and mount it in a container i'd use -v volumename:mountpoint
[21:02:58] <ada_> "docker inspect" from both containers will give us the volume name and the mount point s33ker 
[21:03:15] <rawtaz> yeah better follow the good advice from miss ada :-)
[21:03:16] <s33ker> aa let me check if new volumes have been created from what i understand
[21:03:33] <rawtaz> hopefully we'll see that they are different volumes, that'd be the logical explanation
[21:03:35] <ada_> s33ker: can almost guarantee they got 'created' if the container runs
[21:03:36] <s33ker> aa thank you guys yes lol
[21:03:48] <ada_> s33ker: just post "docker inspect " output from both containers in the same pastebin plz
[21:03:54] <s33ker> i have 3 diffrent volumes since the name was in use it just gave them a diffrent name
[21:04:01] <ada_> that will tell us exactly what volumes you have mounted
[21:04:24] <s33ker> let me try what rawtaz pointed out i was using it wrong
[21:04:33] <rawtaz> s33ker: when you do specify just  -v ScriptVolume  where do you expect that volume to be mounted inside the container? um just curious
[21:04:41] <rawtaz> im*
[21:05:20] <s33ker> in root
[21:05:26] <rawtaz> right gotcha
[21:05:44] <s33ker> i mena i made the first on so i was happy with root

[21:28:07] *** Joins: Bardon (~Bardon@user/Bardon)
[21:29:46] <s33ker> i think the original rawtaz answer might be correct when it is a must to specitfy path
[21:31:38] <ada_> a named directory is a top level directory, it's not possible to do something like `-v scriptvolume/subdirectory:/home/user/project/scripts/foo`
[21:32:04] <ada_> you cannot specify a subdirectory of the volume name, that doesnt' work - the volume name argument may not contain / characters
[21:32:11] <ada_> but you can target whatever destination you want
[21:32:19] *** LiENUX is now known as LiENUS
[21:33:06] <ada_> if you don't specify a volume name AND a destination, you get an anonymous volume
[21:33:08] <s33ker> so what you are saying i am able to make subdirectories inside the container and see those on the other just the mount process needs to have the volumes parent directory path
[21:33:15] <s33ker> aa thx
[21:33:25] <ada_> theres' nothing to prevent you from making directories inside a volume
[21:33:36] <ada_> you have 2 different anonymous volumes mounted in 2 different containers
[21:33:40] <ada_> so a change in one doesn't affect the other
[21:33:46] <s33ker> yes yes thank you guys i guess i need to specify the path like it was said
[21:33:50] <ash_worksi> oh ada is here!
[21:34:05] <ada_> s33ker: yes you need to specify a target path in both containers
[21:34:28] <s33ker> ada_ and rawtaz ty
[21:34:31] <ada_> I'd also suggest not using capitalization in your volume name as a convention
[21:34:56] <s33ker> ok
[21:38:35] <ash_worksi> ada_: can I ask for your input on this? I want to seemlessly make contract-breaking changes to a service's api behind a gateway
[21:38:37] <ash_worksi> (1) deploy the new service alongside the old service with a different hostname (2) update the gateway to use the new hostname (3) replace gateway so it uses the new service (4) take down old serv

[21:45:13] <ada_> DNS short circuit is how I've done it in the poast
[21:45:41] <ash_worksi> ada_: re DNS short ... @me?
[21:45:43] <ada_> you could also do a canary style rollout where your hostname ends up pointing to both destinations, maybe your proxy can do a weighting algorith so only like 10% of your traffic goes to the new destination
[21:46:02] <ada_> then you can make sure it's acceptable before your remove the original destination
[21:46:20] <ada_> main concern I think would be session state
[21:46:36] <ash_worksi> how does DNS short-circuiting work?
[21:46:41] <ada_> just what you describe
[21:46:44] <ash_worksi> oh
[21:46:46] <ash_worksi> neat
[21:47:51] <ada_> although I might not even bother using different hostnames
[21:48:00] <ash_worksi> so do you just run it as `docker service create my_service_new:latest_hash` ... and then ... rename it after taking down `my_service:older_hash` ?
[21:48:01] <ada_> like, the service itself probably doesn't know/care what its own hostname IS
[21:48:05] <ash_worksi> or... no
[21:48:05] <ada_> so, why do they need to be different?
[21:48:30] <ash_worksi> wont that cause conflicts?
[21:48:34] <ada_> how are you doing the frontend part do you have a proxy or L7 LB like traefik?
[21:48:58] <ash_worksi> erm, you mean the gateway?
[21:49:06] <ada_> sure

[21:50:39] <ash_worksi> yeah, that looks about right... cept there's also an nginx proxy in between internet and gateway

[21:50:59] <ada_> ok I guess I'm not clear on the definition of gateway

[21:51:08] <ash_worksi> api-gateway
[21:51:24] <ada_> gotcha
[21:51:40] <ash_worksi> the idea is just to have a single service which proxies a multitude of microservices
[21:51:43] <ada_> sure
[21:51:58] <ada_> so then, the API gateway knows what the backend service name is and the backend service's operational port
[21:52:48] <ash_worksi> I would do this with nginx using `location ~ /(?P<service>.*)/ { fastcgi_pass $service:9000; }` if not for security and translation
[21:52:50] <Tach> has anyone experience with the go client package ?
[21:52:58] <ash_worksi> ada_: correct
[21:53:38] <ash_worksi> Tach: try #go-nuts
[21:53:56] <Tach> ash_worksi I did, no success
[21:54:21] <ash_worksi> sorry, I have had limited success in #go-nuts too, but at least they're familiar with it
[21:54:37] <Tach> not many people do it sees
[21:54:40] <Tach> seems
[21:54:49] <ada_> ash_worksi: ok so, if all the routing logic is in the api gateway, then I don't think you'd have to touch DNS
[21:55:02] <ada_> but you'd have to change the API gateway config to point to the new backend
[21:55:16] <ash_worksi> ada_: so, you would just put the services on different ports and change the client request url to eg `my_service:8081` ?
[21:56:22] <ada_> yeah if I understand the structure correctly I'd just change the gateway config to point to `service-new`
[21:56:43] <Tach> I need to figure out how I can get the IP address of a swarm container using the go packages
[21:56:44] <ada_> or like in the canary example, if the gateway can do both at teh same time, with sticky sessions, thats what I would prefer
[21:56:46] <ash_worksi> so you _would_ use a different hostname?
[21:57:01] <ash_worksi> ada_: is that difficult?
[21:57:05] <ada_> ash_worksi: I guess I'm just not thinking of them as "hostnames"
[21:57:06] <ash_worksi> the canary example?
[21:57:28] <ada_> ash_worksi: but yes, if the api gateway is pointing to docker services, then the service name is the hostname
[21:57:29] <ada_> so yes
[21:58:05] <ada_> I think I might have to like, draw this
[21:58:06] <s33ker> i tested it guys and it works...thank you
[21:58:16] <ash_worksi> ada_: does that make it a pain to deploy though CI if you want to ensure your new service takes another hostname?
