[03:18:06] <Joanna> jan6: the video steers people away from the root of the problem which is parents not being adequately involved in their children’s lives and leaving them in the hands of strangers. That being said I believe many children have a lot of fun on roblox rather than playing with other children in real life and I don’t think moving people into online worlds happened by accident
[03:18:24] <jan6> uh, no
[03:18:39] <jan6> you should NOT be overseeing everything your child does
[03:19:26] <Joanna> Why not?
[03:19:43] <jan6> same reason you shouldn't be overseeing everything an adult does
[03:20:51] <Hydragyrum> something something helicopter parents
[03:20:57] <jan6> ^ 
[03:21:13] <Joanna> Well then they shouldn’t be crying when strangers do something bad to their kids that they failed to protect. The whole implication of the video is roblox should do a better job of babysitting
[03:21:44] <jan6> "but think of the CHILDREN" is definitely not the correct parenting technique, but neither is total neglect hoping that "Mr Youtube will be a great parent"
[03:22:44] <Joanna> Most parents don’t protect their children well enough in my opinion. I’m all for children being able to have rights and historically age 13 or 14 was the age of adulthood in most cultures
[03:23:14] <Hydragyrum> back in the day, parents would kick their kids out until dusk and they'd go play with the other kids on the street and do all sorts of stuff, turned out fine
[03:23:41] <jan6> the problem that's pointed out is that roblox doesn't CARE that the community is basically creating pseudo-legal companies, which may or may not have bad working conditions, or outright scam people out of their work, you're NOT ALLOWED to talk about it in any official channel, and instead of properly moderating their forum, they're just driving people to other platforms, where "not our problem"
[03:23:53] <Joanna> In fact there is a modern phenomenon of kidaults.. people who reach adulthood and still act like children
[03:24:24] <jan6> like legally, sure, they can't be held responsible, but they won't even ANSWER the questions about that dubious behaviour
[03:24:49] <jan6> the kidadults are usually BECAUSe of helicopter parents, usually single child, too
[03:25:20] <Joanna> Hydragyrum: back in the days before mandatory school people were a lot smarter going to the local schoolhouse voluntarily
[03:25:36] <jan6> you have only one kid, and are willing to do anyone to make their life the safest and best you can imagine, but that also means not letting them take any safe risks, not getting ready for own responsibility
[03:25:56] <Hydragyrum> indeed
[03:26:00] <Hydragyrum> (to both)
[03:26:16] <jan6> well modern school system is obsolete, antiquated from the days of factory education where you then went to factory work, anyway
[03:26:26] <Joanna> Parents should not allow people to injure their child in any way.
[03:26:50] <jan6> "after graduating, you have One Standard Set OF Knowledge" but probably forgot 70% of it anyway
[03:27:02] <Joanna> jan6: not just factories also cannon fodder for military
[03:27:10] <jan6> same thing, basically
[03:27:17] <Hydragyrum> and 90% of it is pretty useless
[03:27:32] <jan6> well, at least over here, most of what you learn isn't useless per say
[03:27:40] <jan6> but you have to MEMORIZE most stuff, not LEARN
[03:27:54] <Hydragyrum> like sure some of it's useful for college but then 70% of what you learn in college turns out to be pretty useless, compared to what you learn by doing
[03:27:57] <jan6> you're never taught how to USE information, only "here's data, remember it next week"
[03:28:01] <Joanna> The term helicopter parent seems like it’s trying to shame people for wanting to protect their children from harm.
[03:28:17] <jan6> because they're doing it wrong, Joanna
[03:28:22] <Hydragyrum> overprotective parenting keeps kids from growing up and learning to do things on their own
[03:28:33] <jan6> unless you want more kid-adults
[03:29:10] <Joanna> Anyone who entrusts their children to strangers is under protective..
[03:29:17] <jan6> uh no
[03:29:26] <jan6> by your definiton everyone HAS to be home-schooled
[03:29:45] <jan6> because pretty much nobody personally knows any of their kid's teachers, they're just trusted strangers
[03:29:52] <Joanna> Or schooled by someone you know really really well
[03:30:20] <jan6> both of which leave HUGE possibility for the parents or Trusted Person to teach either nonsense, or just inaccurate information
[03:31:04] <Joanna> Teachers are just government tools brainwashing kids is all.
[03:31:14] <jan6> maybe they are where you grew up
[03:31:42] <Joanna> A teacher is a very poor substitute for a parent.
[03:31:47] <jan6> depends for what
[03:32:05] <jan6> teachers are definitely not meant for emotional support, they are meant to teach things
[03:32:19] <Joanna> If you live in rich neighborhood the teachers are better
[03:32:32] <jan6> neighborhood doesn't matter, the people do
[03:32:54] <Joanna> Small children need nurturing not brainwashing!!
[03:33:36] <Hydragyrum> that doesn't mean their parents are capable of teaching them all the stuff they may need to know themselves -- especially kids who plan to go to college and stuff
[03:33:56] <jan6> define brainwashing though
[03:34:18] <Joanna> Neighborhood matters a heck of a lot I went to school in rich neighborhood until second grade and what a shock I was in for changing to school in working class neighborhood
[03:34:49] <jan6> again, neighborhood doesn't matter, people do
[03:35:15] <jan6> rich people/companies/schools can just afford to ONLY hire people that meet their desires
[03:35:26] <jan6> poorer ones have to settle for any that qualify enough
[03:35:39] <jan6> but it all depends on PEOPLE
[03:36:15] <Joanna> The fact that nobody thinks that it being illegal to spend everyday with your child is not a problem shows the extent of the problem.
[03:36:40] <jan6> what are you even saying
[03:36:41] <Hydragyrum> >being illegal
[03:36:42] <Hydragyrum> what
[03:36:46] <jan6> no punctuation and hard to read
[03:36:48] <Hydragyrum> where is that illega
[03:36:50] <Hydragyrum> l
[03:37:28] <Joanna> jan6: people in rich neighborhoods don’t tolerate having teachers call their children retarded and beat them with ping pong paddles
[03:37:30] <jan6> where is it illegal to spend everyday, or NOT spend everyday with your child?
[03:37:51] <jan6> physical abuse is illegal in pretty much all developed countries, pretty sure
[03:39:59] <jan6> verbal is a LOT harder to pin down where it starts or ends, but calling "retarded" I'm pretty sure is also very much not liked (although probably won't get them into legal problems unless it's a frequent thing)
[03:42:45] <Joanna> The child is required to go to day prison 30 hours a week right?
[03:42:55] <jan6> that is not a prison
[03:43:37] <Joanna> People in poor neighborhoods treat children like garbage compared to rich neighborhoods I know this for a fact from personal experience
[03:44:01] <jan6> everything depends a lot by areas and countries
[03:44:10] <jan6> in USA, everything is crap, yes
[03:44:43] <Joanna> It’s a crime to not send children to day prison it’s called truancy . Parents have literally been sent to Jail for their children failing to show up at day prison
[03:45:06] <jan6> without arrangements, sure
[03:45:33] <jan6> all you're required to do is achieve a certified level of education, by default, that's a normal school
[03:46:20] <jan6> depending on school, you can probably arrange for partial attendance, provided the kid delivers required tasks on time
[03:47:04] <jan6> and you can probably arrange for homeschooling too, if you really want, although you'd probably still need to take exams and tests in controlled environments
[03:47:11] <Joanna> But stupid parents have this fantasy that oh my children are getting an amazing education and are going to be a big success in life.  How did being compelled  to go a place where it was ok for people to abuse me make me a success in life?
[03:47:56] <jan6> "Truancy is usually explicitly defined in the school's handbook of policies and procedures."
[03:48:05] <jan6> education != success
[03:49:19] <Joanna> The fact is children can teach themselves. The day prison is not for the benefit of the children. It is a factory for creating damaged easy to control brainwashed people.
[03:49:35] <jan6> problem is ensuring they DO teach themselves
[03:49:56] <jan6> same for office work, y'know
[03:50:30] <jan6> for any non-physical work, you don't ACTUALLY have to be present in a work building, technically
[03:51:01] <Joanna> jan6: parents originally had guns pointed at them to compel them to donate their children to the brainwashing factory. And originally school was only 3 months a year or so.
[03:51:49] <jan6> but being present makes it easier to concentrate, for some people (clear distinction betwen work/free time areas), and it's much easier to ask for help in-person, usually, especially if the person's too shy to actually speak up
[03:52:05] <jan6> "originally" depends on countries and areas, again
[03:52:16] <Joanna> The children will teach themselves what interests them. Not necessarily some stupid school curriculum that they will never need.
[03:52:44] <jan6> problem with "what interests" is that it excludes a lot of stuff that would be required, or simply useful, to know
[03:52:49] <jan6> you can't learn about something you're not aware of
[03:52:59] <Joanna> I know someone who never went to school who loves to learn stuff.
[03:53:15] <jan6> and pure titles and broad descriptions don't help too much with finding interesting stuff, either
[03:53:42] <Joanna> I’m a big fan of public libraries
[03:53:51] <jan6> schools nowdays are trying to slowily move away from the cookie cutter stamp-education, anyway, towards a bit more personal experience
[03:55:04] <jan6> I'm not a fan of neither the current, nor proposed more-personal-school systems, but they have good reasons to be in place, instead of "meh, let everyone learn only what they want"
[03:56:55] <Joanna> If schools were not bad they wouldn’t have to be mandatory. The day prison gets paid for every inmates whose body is parked there everyday. It’s a big scam.
[03:56:58] <jan6> you're probably not gonna need to know what years Plato lived, and don't HAVE to be able to mentally calculate 12*4/2, but they're good for having a common set of information, so "contemporary of Plato" will ring a bell of broadly "oh that was like...before christ, right?"
[03:57:30] <jan6> you're very much biased yourself, lol
[03:57:54] <Joanna> I know what I know
[03:58:11] <Joanna> Schools teach garbage.
[03:58:30] <jan6> too bad we don't have future-tech for simulating outcomes of different choices, to illustrate how bad it'd be to abolish school system altogether
[03:58:47] <Joanna> The only useful class I ever took there was the class with sewing machines.
[03:58:56] <jan6> poor people would likely be WORSE educated, and rich people would have all the resources, even more than nowdays
[03:58:57] <jan6> etc
[04:00:29] <Joanna> Abolish day prison. There is nothing wrong with people in neighborhoods gathering to have children socialize and learn. Most school buildings are so bad they should be torn down and rebuilt.
[04:01:19] <Joanna> I think paid teachers should be replaced by parents and volunteers from the community.
[04:01:26] <jan6> schools don't have to be mandatory, but common base knowledge, has to be, for current level of society to work (else you're basically falling to a society similar to middle ages, with rich and well-educated people vs poor peasants, who might know exactly how to fix your shoe, but no clue about what magic makes a clock tick, or why would soap NOT clean certain spots)
[04:02:23] <jan6> Joanna: if your idea was made true, murica would be full of very poorly educated gun-wielding vegan christians ready to shoot any spawn of devil who dares to wear leather jackets or support the opposite political party
[04:02:24] <Joanna> Fixing shoes is important. Learning how to craft clothing would be a step up for most people
[04:03:26] <jan6> problem isn't schools, back in the day, that is, like 4 or 5 decades or so ago, people DID make and fix most of their own clothes, especially fashion items
[04:03:45] <jan6> teen-ish schoolchildren did, too
[04:03:53] <Joanna> If schools were gotten rid of property taxes would go down and people with children could spend the money on operating a school in their community as they saw fit with their own money.
[04:04:16] <jan6> "they saw fit" is HORRIBLY optimistic and naive view of people
[04:04:23] <Joanna> Modern people are dumbed down and dependent
[04:04:41] <jan6> and you WANT dumbed down people to teach others to ALSO be dumbed down and dependent
[04:04:54] <jan6> because they see it "fit"
[04:04:56] <Joanna> What do you think people did before compulsory school? They had one room school houses for every neighborhood
[04:05:19] <jan6> *village
[04:05:27] <jan6> uh, *city
[04:05:36] <jan6> and per a couple villages, maybe
[04:05:59] <jan6> not even every village could afford a school
[04:06:24] <Joanna> People know how to read and write in the 1800s when there was voluntary school. They were more like the amish. They also knew how to farm and craft things.
[04:06:26] <jan6> and after that, also before school, was child labor in factories
[04:07:35] <jan6> if you want any sort of technology to exist, and don't want an utter dystopia of huge class divide, then you do not want the future you're proposing
[04:08:30] <jan6> most things weren't invented because some guy loved the thing, so he made a better version
[04:08:40] <jan6> they were made because people wanted something better
[04:09:00] <jan6> if you hate manually carting stuff, make a horse pull it
[04:09:12] <jan6> you hate constantly re-lighting your candle, invent a shroud
[04:10:37] <Joanna> Government run brainwashing factories are not the answer. People getting together and learning voluntarily about things that actually are useful is what is needed.
[04:11:00] <jan6> but you can't do that if you can't even get into the field, because to fix software you'd need to learn programming, to learn programming you'd also need to learn maths, to make sense of half the ideas things the software does and uses
[04:11:36] <jan6> Joanna, what you want, is an libertarian anarchist future
[04:11:42] <jan6> one that won't happen for the next few centuries
[04:11:53] <jan6> they are not brainwashing factories
[04:12:17] <jan6> and have you ever heard of stuff such as after-school groups? or any other communities?
[04:12:18] <Joanna> Most programming is self taught
[04:12:20] <jan6> they are things
[04:12:50] <jan6> yes, because you already knew a lot of the stuff, and could look up the rest
[04:12:56] <jan6> but you'd need to learn to use a computer first
[04:12:58] <jan6> or a phone
[04:13:15] <jan6> and you wouldn't have learned any specific grammar
[04:13:35] <jan6> so you might think and speak in sentences that don't hold up with the programming language
[04:13:43] <Joanna> I don’t credit school with teaching me reading or math or anything else useful apart from the exception mentioned earlier
[04:13:49] <jan6> and similarly would have difficulties looking up help online
[04:14:15] <jan6> there's an old saying, "teacher is not the one who teaches, but the one who's learned from"
[04:14:21] <jan6> well, paraphrased
[04:14:31] <jan6> it's impossible to FORCE someone to learn
[04:14:44] <Joanna> I was taught to read by my mother after the teacher at school decided that I was retarded.
[04:14:46] <jan6> at most, you can force them to memorize something, for a limited time
[04:15:11] <Joanna> Forced learning = brainwashing
[04:15:22] <jan6> you cannot force the learning of anything
[04:15:27] <jan6> learning is volountary
[04:15:29] <Hydragyrum> Joanna: homeschooling isn't that hard to do (in terms of getting it set up legally) most places in the US
[04:15:35] <jan6> ^ and that
[04:15:51] <jan6> you might want to focus your efforts more on spreading the info on HOW to do it
[04:15:54] <Hydragyrum> it's not like you have to send kids to public school, even if you can't afford to send them to a private or charter school in the area
[04:16:24] <jan6> ^ what I said, afaik, you just have to get certified as knowing some base knowledge
[04:16:49] <jan6> which means you might just need to show up to a couple official tests, and learn everything at home, at your own pace
[04:17:13] <Hydragyrum> yep, I know a bit about it because I and my siblings were largely homeschooled
[04:17:38] <Joanna> Hydragyrum: no wonder you are smarter than average:)
[04:18:07] <jan6> over here, too, is a base-level state-mandated education level, but most schools actually go above that, at least non-rural ones, the base level is specifically set up low enough that pretty much everyone can manage to get over it, even if only barely
[04:18:30] <Joanna> In some places it’s illegal to home school. In other places you can homeschool as long as you teach the same garbage offered in public school.
[04:19:13] <jan6> you just have to prove that you know the legal base level, you can do the same tricks as in normal school, AKA learn it a month or week before test, and forget righ afterwards ;P
[04:19:30] <Joanna> It amazes me how even school shootings don’t deter most people from sending their kids off th
[04:19:40] <Joanna> To the brainwashing factory
[04:20:41] <jan6> I'm pretty sure that everywhere in north america + europe it's possible to set up homeschooling, although in some cases I suppose there might be requirement for something like being declared "special needs" or whatever
[04:21:26] <jan6> keep in mind that I don't *KNOW* much about nearly anything I talk about, it's 90% conjecture, 5% facts, 20% opinion ;P (not 100%, and that's the point)
[04:21:33] <Hydragyrum> I heard about a recent shooting where the kid was really obviously needing to be taken out of school ASAP but they didn't even bother to check his locker or bag for the gun he had, was in a meeting with a school counselor and his parents hours before the shooting because they found a drawing he did of shooting up the place with the text "help me I can't stop these thoughts"
[04:21:45] <Hydragyrum> they just threw the guy back in class and well he shot the place up
[04:22:05] <jan6> classic USA education
[04:22:26] <jan6> I'm happy I haven't had to suffer through THAT
[04:22:36] <jan6> even though school killed my spark
[04:22:43] <Hydragyrum> the parents were like "yeah we don't need to take him out of school to go to a psych" too
[04:23:04] <Joanna> The fact that people don’t understand why it’s wrong to have government involved in their parenting shows how hopeless the situation is. I think the latest thing schools are teaching is gender confusion ...
[04:23:20] <jan6> there is no gender confusion
[04:23:23] <Hydragyrum> and critical race theory
[04:23:51] <jan6> gender is what YOU identify as, sex is what you have, physically
[04:24:07] <Joanna> Hydragyrum: they didn’t take him out of school because they get paid daily for each inmate .
[04:24:36] <jan6> as MOST people fall into binary norms, it's not that much "confusion" to fixate on only those, either
[04:25:15] <jan6> and if you mean confusion that there's more than two, then oooooooh boy
[04:26:12] <Joanna> Schools also teach sex education to encourage premarital sex.
[04:26:21] <jan6> which is great
[04:26:55] <Joanna> Great for destroying families
[04:27:06] <jan6> no
[04:27:25] <jan6> marriage shouldn't ever be the treshold
[04:27:53] <jan6> nor should you limit yourself to only one partner
[04:28:28] <jan6> not as in cheating, but as in, being married shouldn't mean there's literally one person in the entire world you're "allowed" to have sexual relationship with
[04:30:47] <jan6> you shouldn't stay with someone you don't like anymore, "because we're married, and I loved her 10 years ago", but as long as they agree, you should also be OK having different possibilities open
[04:31:06] <jan6> such as "I love your personality, but I love his/her body"
[04:31:07] <Joanna> Growing up in poverty with a single mother is not fun.
[04:31:17] <jan6> there's a lot of things that aren't fun
[04:31:40] <jan6> that is one, sure
[04:32:34] <Joanna> There are people who benefit from us not having strong family ties to rely upon.
[04:38:59] <Joanna> The whole women’s lib thing was for destroying families and having people depend on government to raise their kids
[04:39:51] * jan6 reminds 'emselves to never ask Joanna for anything related to education or politics
[04:40:20] <jan6> you have extremist views that might be shaped by your life, but that I view as completely off the charts wrong, lol
[04:40:35] <Hydragyrum> I'm with Joanna on this one...
[04:40:47] <jan6> IDK about any movements
[04:40:56] <jan6> but in general, from the past conversation
[04:41:34] <jan6> of course there's always SOMEONE to benefit from ANYTHING
[04:41:36] <Joanna> My father disowned me before I was born because he didn’t want to contribute to my well being
[04:42:09] <Joanna> Both parents  working also drives down wages.
[04:42:21] <Joanna> Men and women competing over paying jobs
[04:42:34] <jan6> it's one factor, sure
[04:42:45] <jan6> probably a big factor
[04:43:45] <Joanna> Latch key children parked in front of tvs
[04:45:20] <jan6> or iphones
[04:47:06] <Joanna> And hence the complaints about roblox isn’t protecting children!!
[04:47:15] <jan6> if there's one thing I agree is awful parenting, it's making your TV/phone/computer/internet your babysitter, no matter if you're nearby and don't care, or need to run away entirely (although I think it's technically illegal to leave kids home alone nowdays)
[04:47:22] <jan6> roblox's thing was different
[04:47:32] <jan6> title is one thing, content is another
[04:48:36] <jan6> roblox has stuff like a collectables market, which is basically devolved into a pseudo-stock-market, as any sane person would've predicted
[04:48:52] <jan6> which they rightfully compare to literally gambling
[04:49:10] <Joanna> I see people outside and when their child in stroller cries they had it a smart phone!!
[04:49:16] <jan6> duh
[04:49:31] <jan6> nowdays everyone is giving their kids a phone just to keep 'em quiet
[04:49:51] <jan6> sometimes locked down to a single app, like youtube, sometimes not even that
[04:50:37] <jan6> (also kids are crafy lil' buggers anyway, they might well oversee your password, or find a way to un-pin that app)
[04:54:14] <Joanna> The whole cultural thing of babies being isolated is separate rooms in cages and carted around in strollers not allowed to see their mother is all part of the agenda.
[04:54:33] <jan6> what agenda
[04:54:42] <jan6> to make depressed miserable adults, agenda?
[04:54:43] <jan6> lol
[04:55:19] <Joanna> The mind control agenda. Parents are abusing their children and don’t even realize it.
[04:55:38] <jan6> it's no control
[04:55:50] <jan6> abuse, maybe, sure
[04:56:01] <jan6> control requires, well, control
[04:56:10] <Joanna> Being left alone is the most terrifying thing on earth for babies
[04:56:33] <jan6> isolating to rooms might make the people more receptive to suggestions and stuff, but it, itself, is no control
[04:58:21] <Joanna> Probably causes people to be self centered
[04:58:40] <Joanna> And lacking empathy
[04:59:12] <jan6> nope
[04:59:36] <jan6> self-centering is a different part of the culture
[04:59:54] <Joanna> It also helps the internet of things spyware agenda
[04:59:55] <jan6> lacking empathy, not really, but slightly, sure
[05:00:07] <jan6> there's actually studies about it, fyi
[05:00:56] <Joanna> There is not much empathy
[05:00:58] <jan6> how the west's baby-isolation philosophy is not actually "natural" in any way, and in pretty much all other cultures, it's normal to keep the baby in same bed, or at least same room as parents
[05:01:28] <jan6> often to quite an age, like you might even have a 5-year old in the same bed
[05:01:48] <jan6> west rushes hard to push people to "mature too early"

[05:02:34] <Joanna> Yes
[05:02:48] <jan6> https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210222-the-unusual-ways-western-parents-raise-children
[05:02:56] *** Joins: portalrat (~portalrat@user/portalrat)
[05:03:01] <Joanna> Western culture is cruel and produces mean people
[05:03:27] <jan6> "From sleeping in separate beds to their children to transporting them in prams, Western parents have some unusual ideas about how to raise them."
[05:03:32] <jan6> not mean, inherently
[05:03:57] <jan6> mean-ness comes from the fact that everyone around 'em is somewhat mean
[05:04:04] <jan6> which I suppose IS culture
[05:04:08] <jan6> but you get the point
[05:04:57] *** Quits: s1gyn (~s1gyn@user/s1gyn) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0.1)
[05:05:32] <jan6> it's moreso that mean and money-focused is the "normal" people are surrounded with, rather than the result of specific strategies
[05:06:59] <jan6> also you should seriously relax about your conspiracy theories about "government evil", there's some bad people there, but most people there are simply not aware of the harm and whiplash effect of their actions
[05:07:14] <jan6> just people out of touch with reality
[05:08:12] <Hydragyrum> government is not just the sum of the people in it
[05:08:23] <jan6> like "we must do X to prevent Y" without realizing that it actually increases Z bad thing, which is a source/cause of Y
[05:09:52] <jan6> or simply blindingly ignorant, like the recent fun effect of "whaaat, they right-clicked and saw teachers' social security numbers in our horrible web-app? nooo, they're evil hackers, and I will make sure they're punished! even though they responsibly disclosed that problem to us privately!"
[05:10:55] <Joanna> I think western culture is more materialistic than cultures that do attachment parenting
[05:11:02] <jan6> yes
[05:11:05] <jan6> definitely
[05:11:14] <jan6> murica especially, is ultracapialist
[05:11:47] <Joanna> Hydragyrum: government is really just majorly of non thinking people controlled by very few people at the top probably
[05:11:55] <jan6> weeeeeel
[05:12:20] <Hydragyrum> and the people pulling the strings have a lot of different ways they want to pull it
[05:12:34] <jan6> government is mostly good intentions, with some bad people mixed in, who muddle the waters, and help steer the decisions in ways that align with their agenda
[05:13:02] <Hydragyrum> >ultracapitalist< lol we've got much taxes and state welfare, that's not all that capitalist
[05:13:14] <jan6> it is, lol
[05:13:22] <jan6> especially healthcare and culture
[05:13:41] <jan6> of course, it CAN always be worse
[05:13:58] <jan6> but even something as simple as not bothering to include taxes in the shop prices
[05:14:26] <Joanna> Government is necessary to coordinate but it always self destructs or gets conquered by another government
[05:14:31] <jan6> if your shop is big enough to span several states, it can definitely afford some people to write up correct price labels
[05:14:47] <jan6> similar stuff in a lot of other places too
[05:15:06] <jan6> imho the best governmental type is direct democracy, at city-state sized chunks
[05:15:28] <jan6> which can then form larger and larger alliances and coalitions and stuff, depending on who's currently in power
[05:16:48] <jan6> because right now, in usa, there's not really any choice, anyway, it's "choose A or B or vote for someone who won't win" AKA not any real choice, over here the parties can redistribute the votes as they please, etc etc
[05:17:06] <jan6> everywhere is flawed
[05:17:09] <jan6> the world is broken
[05:17:12] <jan6> and we can't fix it
[05:17:58] <Joanna> The problem is small fair governments get squashed by larger governments with large numbers of brainwashed minions
[05:18:10] <Joanna> Also technology is a factor
[05:18:31] <jan6> exactly why city-states ;P
[05:19:18] <jan6> if the city-states are similar enough size class, then there's won't *BE* a large government with brainwashed minions
[05:20:02] *** Quits: portalrat (~portalrat@user/portalrat) (Remote host closed the connection)
[05:20:07] <jan6> and no one city can have enough power to secretly do weapon tests, or hold up a big enough army to not be overtaken by anyone else
[05:20:26] *** Joins: portalrat (~portalrat@user/portalrat)
[05:20:33] <jan6> well, not power to cover it up well
[05:20:37] <Joanna> It will start with one city state conquering its neighbor and getting larger
[05:20:51] <jan6> and from there history will repeat itself, sure
[05:20:59] <jan6> if you let it
[05:21:35] * jan6 sleeps btw
[05:21:39] <jan6> it's like 04 at night
