[05:00:46] <leah> fedora and guix both suck. especially guix
[05:00:54] <leah> they are quite simply the worst distros available
[05:01:14] <leah> my favourite distros are debian/devuan, arch/artix and alpine
[05:01:37] <leah> but i approve your use of british dvorak keyboard layout
[05:01:40] <DiffieHellman> The best distro is Gentoo-libre GNU/Linux, none else can compete
[05:01:46] <DiffieHellman> Workman > Dvorak
[05:01:46] * leah is a UK Dvorak user
[05:01:50] <tpefreedom> I also like debian and devuan
[05:01:57] <tpefreedom> I currently run debian
[05:02:20] <tpefreedom> DiffieHellman, Gentoo libre?
[05:02:24] <leah> debian/devuan and arch/artix are the same distinction btw: devuan and artix provide choice of init system, debian/arch don't
[05:02:53] <tpefreedom> I'm on normie US qwerty
[05:02:59] <leah> i mention arch because... arch is actually a free system by default (i don't consider th presence of the firmware package a problem, and you can easily delete it if you want to)
[05:03:01] <DiffieHellman> tpefreedom: Gentoo carefully installed without any proprietary software.
[05:03:05] <leah> otherwise, parabola is ok too
[05:03:40] <DiffieHellman> Doesn't a package chock full of proprietary software by default elimate any chances of a free system./
[05:03:52] <DiffieHellman> You have to go out of your way to make it free after all.
[05:03:54] <leah> i consider full linux, or linux with firmware package deleted, superior to linux-libre: linux-libre doesn't just delete blobs, it removes other stuff too
[05:04:01] <leah> debian's default deblobbed linux kernel is better
[05:04:17] <leah> but seriously
[05:04:23] <leah> avoid fedora and guix like the plague
[05:04:26] <DiffieHellman> There's no need to add kernel there, Linux was only and is only a kernel.
[05:04:27] <leah> both have terrible package managers
[05:04:53] <leah> and in general, i don't like the workflow of either distro

[05:16:29] <leah> trust the user to make a decision. don't make it for them
[05:16:50] <leah> linux-libre model is broken. the debian way is better

[05:20:23] <leah> i think if someone did want fsdg, they should consider making a version of alpine with linux-libre
[05:20:39] <leah> that would then be a great option for people to use if they want linux-libre stuff
[05:20:51] <leah> afaik it's the only non-free thing they have: linux firmware
[05:21:22] <leah> and it's much more lightweight than gnu distros (uses busybox and musl, even on laptop/desktop/workstation)

[05:22:34] <leah> i'd even say it's superior to freedom, because it's simpler. simpler means able to understand it more / have more control
[05:22:40] <leah> gnu distros are huge and bloated by comparison
[05:22:50] * Kolev revels in Guix bloat
[05:22:58] <leah> when something gets too complex, you can't control it
[05:22:58] <leah> like
[05:23:06] <leah> my definition of personal freedom is this:
[05:23:22] <leah> if you can learn how it all works and control your whole system yourself. then it's all free
[05:23:33] <leah> with most distros nowadays, that's no longer true. it's impossible to have that level of control
[05:23:36] <leah> but that's what alpine is doing
[05:23:43] <leah> busybox is a really nice thing
[05:23:52] <leah> and musl is very "correct", and the code is clean
[05:24:14] <leah> GPL licensed spaghetti code is not much better than proprietary software, in my opinion
[05:24:25] <leah> (most gnu stuff, especially gcc and glibc, are spaghetti)
[05:24:51] <leah> spaghetti that only a few people understand isn't free in practise
[05:24:52] <DiffieHellman> Excuse me.
[05:24:52] <leah> it's like
[05:24:56] <leah> tianocore is a great example
[05:25:06] <leah> it's intel's uefi implementation. and it's free software
[05:25:07] <Kolev> It's spaghetti code so that nobody would be caught dead claiming in court that it is a plagiarization of their work.
[05:25:10] <leah> but it's spaghetti. unreadable code
[05:25:27] <DiffieHellman> You can still use parts of it in free software unlike proprietary software

[05:31:07] <leah> how the fuck is libreboot.org online right now
[05:31:12] <leah> oh
[05:31:16] <leah> i know why
[05:31:26] <leah> wait, no, that still doesn't explain it...
[05:31:35] <leah> ah, actually yes
[05:31:43] <Kolev> leah: Tyler Durden has it online.  
[05:31:59] <leah> because *i'm* online, i have access to dns resolvers
[05:32:06] <leah> and though ns1.libreboot.org is offline, i have dns cached
[05:32:19] <Kolev> Ah.
[05:32:19] <leah> and i'm *on* the same network
[05:32:28] <leah> my local network is all public IPs, including the libreboot one
[05:32:52] <leah> i can access 81.187.191.145/28, the subnet that libreboot.org is on

[05:33:21] <leah> which means...
[05:33:31] <leah> libreboot.org isn't down, for me! just everyone else lol
[05:33:45] <leah> yeah my ISP says it'll be back in a few hours

[17:23:17] <GNUHacker> hi
[17:24:53] <DiffieHellman> labrador: That blog post really isn't well written. Last time I checked, google is the one who signs each play store cr..app (even though the developer needs to give a key as well), so not much difference there. The sandboxing thing isn't an issue with trustable free software that's not out to get you unlike proprietary software. He even says it's a negative that f-droid doesn't allow garbage
[17:24:56] <DiffieHellman> proprietary libraries...
[17:25:32] <DiffieHellman> f-droid kinda is the only one who can sign the apk's anyway, as they're the ones building them.
[17:26:09] *** Joins: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c)
[17:26:20] <labrador> yeah that makes sense DiffieHellman,and f-droid needs to build from source to ensure its free software
[17:26:32] <labrador> unless reproduible builds are used
[17:26:45] <wgreenhouse> as mentioned, reproducible builds can be signed with the developer's key, and f-droid is actively encouraging those
[17:26:59] *** Joins: andrzejku (~andrzejku@45-11-60-125.ip4.greenlan.pl)
[17:27:15] <DiffieHellman> Building from source doesn't ensure that it's free software, but it does ensure that the developer meets the library requirements
[17:28:34] <DiffieHellman> Pro tip; when someone starts recommending proprietary software or obviously nasty services like google play, treat their opinion as you would a grain of salt.

[17:29:41] <wgreenhouse> if graphene wants to do their own package manager containing free software that's fine too
[17:29:55] <DiffieHellman> If I remeber correctly, grapheneOS devs ensure to use the devices IOMMU, but still ship proprietary software. 
[17:30:29] <DiffieHellman> (i.e. like how lineageOS ships proprietary software you don't want or need like unrar)
[17:31:54] <DiffieHellman> 99% of rar files are best opened with the `rm` command and then by finding a better source of the files.

[17:35:23] <johns> there are some fair points in there; but as usual (more surprising in an article of this length), it doesn't discuss the actual threat models, and so ignores the whole "security vs Google" question

[17:42:47] <gnoo> >Besides, their “quality control” offers close to no guarantees as having access to the source code doesn’t mean it can be easily proofread.
[17:42:59] <gnoo> sure, and proprietary apps can be easily proofread
[17:46:09] <johns> right. it's too bad that the article doesn't acknowledge that many of these differences are also resource issues, and hey, maybe for the longer term we should figure out how to get f-droid more resources. so more vetting/proofreading could be done, like google does
[17:46:46] <gnoo> oh, and now they're saing using older sdks is bad. wow, so i should just throw out my 4 year old phone and buy a new one, huh!
[17:47:05] *** Joins: ElectronApps (~ElectronA@user/electronapps)
[17:47:39] <johns> well, there's some validity to that if you're only talking about security
[17:48:30] <johns> the article also blurs the distinction between f-droid.org and the other models the free f-droid client and server software enable. so you *can* actually get your software direct from the developer if the developer self-hosts/distributes
[17:49:23] <gnoo> i think using old devices that still work is much better than any "security". i mean even termux won't work properly on newer androids so they don't even update the play store version
[17:49:38] <gnoo> newer sdk
[17:50:09] <johns> I'm with you gnoo, for a lot of general users. but in an article focused on security I think it's reasonable to mention
[17:50:37] <johns> people need the information to know what's right for them
[17:53:59] <gnoo> okay, but this point is just bad:  F-Droid doesn’t enforce a minimum target SDK for the official repository
[17:54:08] <gnoo> how is it a bad thing?
[17:55:02] <johns> I don't know enough myself to be sure; I'm assuming that there are security / security policy updates in the SDK over time
[17:55:32] <johns> the article points to changes is sandbox policy over time
[17:55:50] <gnoo> i mean the developer can choose the target sdk, unlike in play store. if they want to support only android 12, they can do that, if they want to support android 2+, they can do that
[17:56:52] <gnoo> so it's not a bad point at all, and the play-store's way is just bad. as mentioned, termux won't update from playstore for quite a time now 
[17:57:39] <johns> yes that is an interesting point about how play's policy can cause apps not to update there
[17:59:47] <gnoo> also, people choose a stance, either tofu or the CA model. having both is quite useless as it's the worst of both worlds. (imho)

[18:02:55] <johns> of course it also doesn't address censorship questions
[18:03:44] <johns> all in all, I'm not sure why the conclusion of this article isn't "use an iPhone"
[18:03:54] <gnoo> exactly. at least i can trust f-droid to not install malicious apps "automatically"
[18:04:34] <gnoo> husky (a plemora client) was removed from the play-store for "access to hate speech website"

[18:07:02] <labrador> thats a little stupid gnoo,so playstore also wont contain any web browsers too?
[18:08:13] <gnoo> exactly, but it's google so it's not about logic but about pr
[18:11:55] <wgreenhouse> gnoo: re termux, it sounds like that author would advocate using the developer's github debug builds, or waiting for graphene to roll out their own package manager
[18:12:31] <gnoo> wgreenhouse: but "Nonetheless, I’d still recommend using Play Store for top-notch security"
[18:12:58] <wgreenhouse> gnoo: yes...and then they mentioned several alternatives...
[18:13:36] <gnoo> and then you're trusting microsoft to not do anything malicious with the generated apk.
[18:13:53] <gnoo> i don't know about the author but i trust f-droid much more than nsa/microsoft

[18:14:04] <wgreenhouse> in any event, some of the critiques of f-droid's current state are legitimate, I think. it would be interesting to have an f-droid repo containing only the reproducible builds
[18:14:58] <wgreenhouse> for my own threat model I don't mind that f-droid signs most packages itself but that's a trusting-trust thing in that I know personally a member of that team

[18:17:06] <gnoo> i think a lot of pre-generated apks in github are liked with proprietary libraries which f-droid versions don't.
[18:17:07] *** Joins: galex-713 (~quassel@109.190.253.16)
[18:17:35] <johns> it's kinda funny when people are like "just because it's open source doesn't mean anyone is looking at it" and then when someone is looking at it and then signing it themselves, they are like "oh no another party"
[18:17:57] <johns> it's valid to think about whether you trust the other party, but also acknowledge the potential benefit here
[18:18:41] <gnoo> saying to trust google or microsoft more than f-droid is just wrong, both have shown plenty of times they should never be tursted
[18:19:39] <gnoo> and somehow that article mentions as if air-gapped systems are bad because it requires _some_ human intervention
[18:19:41] <wgreenhouse> gnoo: sure, in general that's potentially true re nonfree libs. for termux the differences are their debug builds log more verbosely if `adb logcat`'d
[18:20:42] <gnoo> i don't know the reason it does that, is it because some non-free library is used to produce more debugging info?
[18:21:14] <Kaiod> although I haven't seen the beginning of the subject, I trust F-droid, it's a team of volunteers and developers who are very dedicated to what they do. immensely more secure and reliable than Amazon Store and Google play
[18:21:17] <wgreenhouse> gnoo: it's just because the debug builds are larger, afaik
[18:21:59] <wgreenhouse> johns: yeah, I like that f-droid is involving someone outside the project reviewing it and making sure they can in fact build it sanely without nonfree deps (and it's distressing when things like e.g. torbrowser can't be included). but they also admit they don't have the humanpower to review for QA, only for free-ness.
[18:22:01] <johns> people need to think about security more specifically than that.. it is a valid point that f-droid being slower to receive/distribute updates is a problem
[18:22:17] <johns> it's just, the solution to that is to help and support f-droid more imo
[18:22:19] <gnoo> oh, can't that be the case for f-droid too? but i guess the tradeoff between size and debug happens there?
[18:22:54] <wgreenhouse> gnoo: if you distributed the debug builds via f-droid as well it'd get confusing. you'd have two similarly named packages in the repo
[18:23:04] <wgreenhouse> or two different versions
[18:23:06] <gnoo> johns: i don't think it's as bad as it sounds, like, how much older is the usual f-droid build? a month?
[18:23:16] *** Joins: scara (~user@user/scara)
[18:23:34] <wgreenhouse> gnoo: it depends on how much the build has to be adjusted for a release. I've seen 2 months
[18:24:42] <gnoo> and how much secutiry issue are we seeing on the wild? when i see people using android 6/7 without receiving any updates for months, i think it's not too bad that it's a month old ( i guess 2 is a rare case? )
[18:24:53] <gnoo> for years*
[18:25:08] <gnoo> (and they never will)
[18:25:48] <johns> part of the issue here is transparency for users

[18:26:09] <johns> some apps are in f-droid but will never be updated further, are users aware of this? or are they under the impression that they are receiving updates?
[18:26:31] <johns> and the concern has to be for the future -- this is something about f-droid that needs focus, if it's to get many more users
[18:26:37] <gnoo> no, i ment updates because people are using play-store with android-6/7/8/9
[18:26:55] <gnoo> and also never getting security updates on the os
[18:27:14] <wgreenhouse> gnoo: johns was referring to the fact that f-droid contains packages that dead-ended there because can no longer be built/distributed under its criteria
[18:27:35] <wgreenhouse> usually those are warned about in the description, assuming users read that
[18:27:41] <gnoo> oh, doesn't that go to the f-droid archives or similarly named repo?
[18:27:48] <wgreenhouse> no
[18:27:54] <gnoo> oh, ok
[18:28:24] <johns> oh yeah I do remember seeing some notes to that effect
[18:28:36] <wgreenhouse> so you'll have some years-old version of a package that is still getting updates elsewhere
[18:28:51] <wgreenhouse> it can be hard for users to assess that tradeoff
[18:29:46] <gnoo> yeah, but the tradeoff is freedom, right?

[20:36:34] <Noisytoot> tfisgnag68, Yes, otherwise you wouldn't be able to REGAIN it.
[20:36:36] <tfisgnag68> I don't understand how I could loose it in a matter of seconds.
[20:37:06] <natewrench123456> tfisgnag68, did you register it to an email
[20:37:10] <Noisytoot> tfisgnag68, Your TCP connection broke and the server only noticed ~256 seconds later when it tried to send a PING and didn't get a response.

[20:40:45] <craigt> tfisgnag68: It sounds like you are having an IRC issue versus any settings in this channel.

[23:04:08] <corwin> ah, python.  thanks for sharing.  (I'm allergic to scripting languages that produce opaque distributables, and also languages where whitespace has syntactic consiquence, so I think I'll keep hacking on my nodejs based stuff.)
[23:06:07] <corwin> Noisytoot: might be worth adding LICENSE.txt to your repo as the source files seem to say it's included.
[23:10:32] <craigt> Dust3D is taking a while to scan
[23:10:38] * craigt is looking at https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/QLC%2B
[23:10:51] <Noisytoot> corwin, It's called 'COPYING': https://git.sr.ht/~noisytoot/fsfbot-sopel/tree/master/item/COPYING
[23:11:37] <corwin> gotcha. thanks.
[23:13:43] <Noisytoot> I have also written some IRC bots using Node.js.
[23:14:01] <craigt> The recommendation is COPYING <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html>, but LICENSE is very common.

[23:18:53] <corwin> Noisytoot: you might find this interesting..  it's rather handy for defining event handlers that "react" to different text based on RegExp match: https://bpa.st/6D2A
