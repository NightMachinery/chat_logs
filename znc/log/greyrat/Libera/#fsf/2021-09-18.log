[02:50:36] <Alicia> I started writing an optical reader for the medical device "freestyle libre" (which contrary to its name has no free drivers). As a working name I've called my software Freestyle Nonlibre, but it strikes me that this name could be legally problematic. Would appreciate advice and/or ideas for a better name

[20:49:23] <Bronzu> tpefreedom, Terraria
[20:49:36] <Bronzu> Unfortunately it is proprietary software, but it is a great game
[20:50:30] <Bronzu> Oh if anyone cares, OpenBSD devs created a utility fnaify that allows you to run Terraria using the free FNA implementation of XFA
[20:50:40] *** Quits: GNUHacker (~gnu@fsf/member/GNUHacker) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[20:50:52] <Bronzu> Essentially allowing XNA games to run on any system
[20:51:11] <Bronzu> Really cool stuff
[20:53:04] <tpefreedom> A free/libre replacement for terraria would be cooler.
[20:53:09] <Bronzu> That is true
[20:53:20] <Bronzu> But the game is very complex
[20:53:44] <Bronzu> It would take a long time to do so, and I don't belive the devs will release the game under a free license any time soon
[20:53:56] <Bronzu> But the did os with their abandond project Terraria Otherworld
[20:55:04] <tpefreedom> How would you license the code of a game using Godot? Would you have to manually license anything besides art assets/music? Would the game code already be under a free license if the engine is under a free license?
[20:56:05] <tpefreedom> When is IDAD 2021?
[20:56:14] *** gnoo_ is now known as gnoo
[20:56:51] <Bronzu> The engine itself will always be under a permissive license, you can't change that. But any code you create you can license in anyway you want, for example the GPL.
[20:57:01] *** Joins: jacobk (~quassel@64.189.202.146)
[20:57:10] <Bronzu> Thus your game will be GPL, but the engine will stay under it's original license.
[20:57:37] <Bronzu> Godot chosen that decision not to alienate most game developers (which unfortunately make proprietary games)
[20:57:55] <Bronzu> Popularity for the engine means more people interested and possibly more hands to help
[20:58:11] <tpefreedom> What about game logic you create using built-in tools rather than your own code you use alongside the engine?
[20:58:56] <Bronzu> Just like using the GCC compiler doesn't make your code GPL licensed, so doesn't Godot. The tools are permissive but anything you can create with them you license yourself.
[20:59:07] <tpefreedom> Are there any 3D engines under the GPL?
[20:59:25] <Bronzu> Well, if I remember correctly Godot does have support for 3D
[20:59:43] <Bronzu> But my best bet is the GZDoom Engine
[20:59:51] <Bronzu> Some great games have been made using it.

[21:03:50] <kompowiec2[x]> tpefreedom: veloren?
[21:04:01] <mindraj> I like original ID Software approach to licensing. That is make all the tools (the game enginge etc) avaliable but keep the game assets, which I think qualify more as a work of art then part of a program, propietry. This way they simultaneously were able to make revenue from their game and enable many other studios and fans to build games on the ID Tech 
[21:04:28] <tpefreedom> As well as fan recreations.
[21:04:43] <Bronzu> Well they only released engines after the game has been out for some time
[21:04:45] <kompowiec2[x]> Afaik they have cool business model which is success, bounty

[21:40:00] <belgin> if your system is small, you can link statically no problem

[21:40:54] <Noisytoot> but it'll be even more minimal if you use dynamic linking
