[00:28:36] <phy1729> Well 4 is not a valid type, so the type checkers should balk at it

[01:42:10] <cowsay_moo> meejah, there really isn't anything specific to my code it's just a general question.  I want to do this with several of my base class methods.  I have a lot of child classes that I want to run perf counters on and it isn't specific to any one class
[01:42:13] <ssbr> as for why -- the reason is to verify that the client is authenticated. (server would have a corresponding public key.)  This avoids e.g. password sharing etc.

[01:42:51] <meejah> cowsay_moo: I would maybe implement a "perf counter" as a decorator, so then you can re-use it anywhere

[01:43:21] <cowsay_moo> @meejah, interesting idea... I'll look into this. I haven't used decorators very much.  Thanks
[01:43:31] <ssbr> blacktoli: this kind of design isn't super common. GitHub uses it to authenticate via SSH, for example -- but, say, gmail only uses it if you sign up a hardware security key (which hosts the private key), and not by default
[01:43:48] <ssbr> (all of this is AIUI -- I haven't looked in detail into the design of security keys or gmail)
[01:44:03] <meejah> sharing private keys is generally a bad idea..

[01:46:05] <meejah> blacktoli: normally you'd negotiate a shared symmetric key per-session .. but also, sounds like Noise protocol  may be relevant for you here
[01:46:24] <ssbr> blacktoli: you don't need per-client private keys for that. Normally you'd "just" use TLS, via e.g. HTTPS, via e.g. gRPC or similar.

[03:05:21] <SnoopJ> clime, inspect.getfullargspec() can do that, but if you are wrapping the function, this is usually done as: `def wrapper(wraparg1, wraparg2, *args, **kwargs): do_stuff(wraparg1, wraparg2); return func(*args, **kwargs);`

[03:08:20] <clime> right, i am not really wrapping a function, i have just extracted a a chunk of code that i call in for loop in each iteration into a function so I want to pass the whole relevant state that outer function gets into this new subfunction

[03:09:40] <clime> i could wrap that state in an object or dict - perhaps that would be the normal way to do this so when I change (add/remove/...) something there, the change will be shared between the two methods (that now have just one or two params - one of them being the new object)...

[18:20:33] <xheimlich> what happens if I make __add__ and __sub__ inconsistent?
[18:20:45] <Yhg1s> xheimlich: they'll be inconsistent.
[18:20:47] <bjs> xheimlich: then you get inconsistent add and sub operations
[18:20:58] <xheimlich> like  a class has two accounts, long_pos and short_pos
[18:20:59] <bjs> What do you expect to happen and/or worry will happen?
[18:21:32] <xheimlich> if I make it so that pos += value  increases long_pos and pos-= value increases short_pos
[18:21:40] <xheimlich> I'm rubberducking to be perfectly honest.
[18:21:41] <SnoopJ> those are separate methods anyway
[18:22:16] <xheimlich> but, uh, do __add__ and __sub__ propagate to other arithmetic operators. I know I can look this up, sorry.
[18:22:28] <Yhg1s> xheimlich: they do not.
[18:22:53] <xheimlich> anyway, why would I do that instead of creating "add" and "sub" (non-dunder) methods and later think if the naming really makes sense.
[18:23:28] <xheimlich> ever since I saw the infix trick with __or__ and __ror__ I can't take my mind off abusing dunders.
[18:23:38] <SnoopJ> xheimlich, the question that bjs asked you is a good one, answering it will likely shed light on your question.
[18:24:00] <bjs> xheimlich: if you don't define __add__ or __sub__ then you can't use + or - to mean the thing you wanted
[18:24:01] <xheimlich> I tend to do these things to make work without working on the valuable stuff itself.

However, the repl used (running python code) i.e (tcpython) is returning a different float from what I see in my local repl. Converting Farenheight=71 to Celsius=X on local produces: Celsius=21.666666666666668, while on the
[19:20:59] <llanhmod> site the repl return 21.666666666666667.  Which is correct? I'm wondering if TC-Python is a culprit or whatever.

[21:20:15] <bjs> xheimlich: they don't really 'stand' for anything, an annotation in quotes means exactly the same as if it weren't in quotes. It's just that sometimes the annotation refers to a name that isn't defined yet, so putting it in quotes will stop Python trying to evaluate it.

[21:21:14] <bjs> but importantly if you want `class C: def f(self, x: C) -> C` this won't work because the name "C" doesn't exist until _after_ the 'class' statement. So when you run it then it'll fail

[21:39:52] <bjs> gurkenglas: well there are a few ways to do this, probably the best is just to engineer it a bit differently so you don't need to store the list in a hashable structure or something.
[21:39:54] <exarkun> Are there really no elpy users in this channel who want to help fix my poor broken elpy configuration?
[21:39:56] <bjs> gurkenglas: but you can also build a wrapper like https://bpa.st/PZOQ
[21:39:57] <SnoopJ> exarkun, that is tantamount to "use this other way that isn't the one you're talking about"
[21:40:14] <SnoopJ> Have you asked #emacs your emacs config question?
[21:41:18] <bjs> gurkenglas: but note that this hashable object might not behave exactly the way you want, i.e. if a == b but a is not b then PromiseFrozenList(a) != PromiseFrozenList(b);  so you have to be a bit careful with doing stuff like this.

[21:42:52] <fofoni_> gurkenglas, for purposes of hashing/identification/etc, you can get a pointer to your object with id(my_list), but then you might get in trouble if your list ever mutates (becuse then the id won't change, but that might not be what you want, and also two distinct objects which are currently identical lists will have different ids)

[21:43:46] <bjs> this is Python you don't need to use id() to get a reference to the object. You can just store it in a variable/attribute.

[21:44:39] <fofoni_> yes, but you'd need to do that yourself. Are user-defined classes hashable by default?
[21:44:45] <fofoni_> (i dont know)
[21:44:54] <SnoopJ> yes, they inherit that behavior from `object`
[21:45:18] <bjs> fofoni_: yes
[21:45:25] <bjs> but not with the behaviour you would want
[21:45:41] <Yhg1s> Only if the class doesn't redefine equality.
[21:46:08] <Yhg1s> object defines equality as identity, and hashes accordingly. If you redefine equality, and you want it to be hashable, you also have to redefine the hash function.
[21:46:13] <SnoopJ> yea, sorry, there's some nuance to it. https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__
[21:46:17] <bjs> Yes, hashing and equality are tied together

[21:46:56] <bjs> Because the rule is that a == b => hash(a) == hash(b) #  this is the property objects of your class should have to be "correctly" hashable.
[21:47:48] <deniska> and if you need some numerical id for your objects, better enumerate them yourself: mapping = collections.defaultdict(lambda c=itertools.count(): next(c))

[23:47:53] <ianliu> I have an image with pixel values in [0, 1, 2]. How do I set a color map for this image where 0 -> white, 1 -> red, and 2 -> blue?
[23:48:20] <ChrisWarrick> ianliu: is this with any specific library?

[23:52:31] <Keeeeg> uninstalling and reinstalling pip doesn't solve the issue
[23:53:19] <ChrisWarrick> did you upgrade pip in the process?
[23:53:29] <Keeeeg> no how would I do that
[23:53:42] <ChrisWarrick> how did you reinstall pip, actually?
[23:53:49] *** pizza is now known as pizzaiolo

[23:54:58] <ChrisWarrick> Keeeeg: pipenv creates a venv for you, and a pip is installed there. That pip seems to be damaged.
[23:55:11] <ChrisWarrick> (also, consider not using pipenv.)
[23:55:37] <ChrisWarrick> (aslo, your pipenv version seems ancient as well)
