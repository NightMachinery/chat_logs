[03:16:56] <buster> Fangs, it's just an ordinary limit. It strictly doesn't and morally shouldn't include the value of the function at the point being considered. You say stuff like "Continuity at x_0 can be expressed by f(x) - f(x_0) = o(1) as x -> x_0". So the mentioning of f(x_0) is already taken care of. (That's for little o. Big O isn't a limit, as cherim says.)

[05:54:01] <dude12312414> the trick i remember was to use cos(pi/5) = -cos(pi - pi/5) = -cos(4*pi/5). Then let x = cos(pi/5) and use the quadruple angle formula: x = -(8x^4 - 8x^2 + 1). So you get a quartic equation 8x^4 - 8x^2 + x + 1 = 0. But this has two rational roots x = -1 and x = 1/2
[05:54:10] <dude12312414> so you can reduce that to a quadratic in x
[05:54:25] <dude12312414> (since cos(2*pi/5) is neither -1 nor 1/2)
[05:54:47] <dude12312414> sorry x = cos(pi/5) is neither -1 nor 1/2

[05:56:50] <dude12312414> the quartic factors as (2x - 1)(x + 1)(4x^2 - 2x - 1), so you get 4x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0, and this gives you the value for cos(pi/5) = [1 + sqrt(5)]/4
[05:57:02] <dude12312414> from which you can deduce the remaining values
[05:59:19] <frelleck> you can also use cos 3x = - cos 2x along with the double & triple angle formulas
[05:59:24] <frelleck> and solve for cos x
[06:00:15] <frelleck> 4y^3 - 3y =  2y^2 - 1, solve for y = cos x
[06:01:14] <frelleck> y = 1 is one root and then you have a quadratic equation to solve
[06:01:32] <dude12312414> hm but isn't it -(2y^2 - 1) on the RHS?

[06:30:28] <Mathmatician> And we have told about sin(20)
[06:30:55] <Mathmatician> If the triangle with angles 36,72 and 72 degrees we can find sin of 36
[06:31:25] <Mathmatician> can we find sin(20) using the triangle with angles 60, 80 and 40 degrees?
[06:31:51] <frelleck> you can't find sin(20) without solving a cubic equation
[06:32:20] <Mathmatician> i think that the triangle 60, 80 and 40 degrees is interesting because we can write a equilateral triangle using the 60 degrees prexistent angle.

[13:55:14] <Vornicus> ok so I'm looking at exterior algebra.  One thing that's in exterior algebra is a 2-vector, an "oriented area".  It's usually written as a bunch of components, one for each axial plane in the space, as the projected area of that oriented area onto that plane, the same way that a regular vector does with axes.  So, I figure, I can come up with an actual shape that actually projects to have these areas
[13:56:17] <Fangs> the thesis was written almost a decade before LaTeX was invented..

[13:58:08] <Vornicus> this I found was not so bad in 3d; I can use the hodge star to find the normal and that's a 1-vector, do gram-schmidt-ish things to find a pair of in-plane vectors, and just size those to get the right actual area
[13:58:17] <Vornicus> but 4d is eluding me

[14:02:09] <Vornicus> My first guess - with the goal of finding a pair of in-plane 1-vectors and use those - was to go something like (x1, 0, z1, w1) and (0, y2, z2, w2), and try to solve the six equations in six unknowns to match, but this doesn't work all the time - a 2-vector with its xy component of 0 will in this thing require either xw and xz, or yw and yz, to be 0, and that isn't great.

[17:00:48] <rubiksdream> aren't polish spaces still complete?

[17:01:34] <rubiksdream> i guess polish spaces are measure spaces rather than metric spaces

[17:04:35] <lieven> there's also the dense countable subset requirement. that keeps the cardinality down to the cardinality of the continuum.

[17:56:34] <Z-module> hi
[17:56:41] <dextaa> I  think i'm a bit closer to my isomorphism from before
[17:56:50] <Z-module> that's good
[17:58:04] <dextaa> so all words in A are of the form a* w b*, so my map would be something like 2^|x| w 3^|y| (the number of a's and b's as prefix/suffix)
[17:58:19] <dextaa> so then i convert w to binary using a=0,b=1
[17:58:34] <dextaa> and then all these numbers are always even because of the trailing a
[17:58:38] <dextaa> so i divide by two

[19:17:11] <Z-module> cadmio, yes but there's a slight catch: in standard disjoint-cycle notation, we don't include "fixed points" = singleton cycles. Your sigma doesn't have any, but if this sigma were in S_11, it would have cycles (9), (10), (11)   as well, even though not written out, and each of *those* would also (each by itself) be an orbit of this action.
