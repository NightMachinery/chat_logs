[08:39:30] <quazimodo> seems unlikely hey

[08:40:57] <tabakhase> for you (and others) published ports is the deal
[08:41:39] <quazimodo> yeah ok
[08:42:02] <quazimodo> so i guess I could set up a container his host ports that forwards requests into the network

[08:43:49] <quazimodo> ah, right
[08:44:21] <quazimodo> i need to turn on a bunch of services, some dockerised and some on localhost, in a cicd environment, and then run e2e tests
[08:44:23] <tabakhase> you want todo X, dont know but think Y may do it, so you come here asking for Y instead of telling us about X :P
[08:45:15] <quazimodo> the services talk to each other easily enough via their named bridge network, but the thing running on localhost has a problem talking to them unless they all expose their own ports to localhost
[08:45:24] <quazimodo> So yeah, fun times for me
[08:46:07] <tabakhase> "container to host" communication is simple too, feed in your docker0 ip or even just "have the container lookup there gateway"
[08:47:27] <tabakhase> host to container = -p ||| container to container = named networks ||| container to host = call the gateway --- all one yould ever ask for
[08:48:11] <quazimodo> container to host = call the gateway < i don't fully understand this actually
[08:48:17] <quazimodo> i haven't tried to do that before
[08:48:26] <quazimodo> last I read it was easy enough on mac but not so easy on linux
[08:48:57] <quazimodo> I'm going to have to C4 Diagram this...
[08:49:24] <tabakhase> from the view of docker your host is rly just a router, doing portforwarding (published ports) on IN routes, and NAT on the way out
[08:53:22] <tabakhase> the "call the gateway" is just a cheaty method so one doesnt have to pass in that IP as envVar or so :P - but shipping it in explicitly is abolutely fine too ((in fact, it should always support both as "your coworker may have the db running on his other pc and not the notebook" or whatever :P
[08:55:00] <quazimodo> indeed
[08:55:28] <quazimodo> so the container looks up it's gateway, it'll always be the ip of the host?
[08:55:32] <quazimodo> unless explicitly changed?
[08:55:33] <tabakhase> DATABASE_HOST=${DATABASE_HOST:-$(ip route show 0.0.0.0/0 dev eth0 | cut -d\  -f3)}    -- or smth like that in the entrypoint is a fairly common pattern
[08:55:52] <quazimodo> thats interesting

[09:01:37] <quazimodo> actually this host thing you just showed me might help me a lot
[09:01:41] <tabakhase> i just abuse the hell out of "--net container:THISONE" in CI :D
[09:01:49] <quazimodo> because I do actually need to send requests to host from container
[09:02:38] <quazimodo> so if a host has a service bound to 0.0.0.0:3000, then a container process should be able to make requests to HOST:3000, presuming that HOST was correctly resolved by $(ip route show 0.0.0.0/0 dev eth0 | cut -d\  -f3)
[09:02:42] <quazimodo> yeah?
[09:02:51] <tabakhase> yep
[09:03:12] <quazimodo> I hope that's true for circleci 
[09:03:23] <quazimodo> they have a 'docker in docker' thing set up where they remotely execute docker commands 
[09:03:44] <quazimodo> i'm suspicious that the gateway in that case may not be the place where the service is running
[09:04:01] <quazimodo> i'll have to play with it I guess
[09:06:06] <tabakhase> idk about circle (gitlab user) - but if its anythign in the same style - and you want say, create a api for a backchannel ("let the container tell your hostscript results") or such that should still all work as expected (as in, your shell is one docker layer deep, the job two layers)

[09:11:23] <quazimodo> i'm not sure how that can work
[09:12:04] <quazimodo> if the shell is inside a docker container, and spawns other containers then they can't be inside container, they'll need to be turned on in a machine somewhere, possibly the same one as the shell's container
[09:12:20] <quazimodo> but the shell's container wont have the same host/ip as the gateway would for those newly spawned containers, will it
[09:12:43] <quazimodo> maybe I can connect a container to a network from inside the container?

[15:30:47] <selckin> only like 3 hours between
[15:31:20] <maret_> btw I've run sudo journalctl -fu docker.service but I don't see anything interesting
[15:31:23] <CRCinAU> yeah - see what drove me crazy is that the LTE modem takes a while to initialise - so the initial boot, dockerd starts before a ppp interface is present :D
[15:31:54] <CRCinAU> but, something in even a docker-compose down / docker-compose up is enough to trigger the bug and crash dockerd
[15:32:13] <CRCinAU> I didn't trace all the code paths, just that one that causes the crash in the first place
[15:33:07] <CRCinAU> I'm not sure how or why, but after dockerd has crashed once, even if you remove the ppp network interface, dockerd still crashes if you try and start it up again
[15:33:26] <CRCinAU> maybe after the crash its leaving the network in some kind of half-baked state that it doesn't like or something
[15:33:38] <maret_> or maybe different question -> I ve started container with volume, but the volume is at wrong path and I wan to change it on running container

[17:21:39] <tabakhase> maret_ what you wanne do? cause kinda "no" but only cause it sounds wrong :D
[17:22:04] <tabakhase> if you geenerally want to ship things in - say mount oyur php code for live edits - bindmounts are the deal
[17:22:38] <maret_> the whole issue was that I started container with volume with wrong path. At first I wanted to commit the container and run again with different volume. That took too much tiem and I coudnt figure out how to check if everything is ok
[17:23:00] <tabakhase> if you actually _ned_ a volume - "docker cp" exits, but it works with containers, not volumes -- so its a 2-step, but doable
[17:23:03] <maret_> so instead i decided to copy data from running container to host , create new volume , copy data into it through temp docker container and run new container

[18:31:05] <GyrosGeier> you can either specify a v4 address for the bind, or disable v6 completely for the entire system, but that will break other things

[21:38:02] <rawtaz> jwr: i could be wrong but i think that if you bind mount your host's folder into/onto /app then youll see whats in that host folder, but the image's original contnet in there will still exist. but it wont be shown
[21:38:34] <rawtaz> so if you mean that you want to see a vendor/bundle/ folder structure in that /app folder you bind-mounted, you need to create that there or on the host

[21:48:02] <jwr> rawtaz: here's my example typed out more explicitly just to make my intent clear: https://pastebin.com/raw/G6cw01cZ. And the motivation for doing `bundle install` inside the container is because that's how we populate our gems in our production image, and i want to reuse as much of the prod image as i can in the local dev stack for DRY reasons as well as consistency.
[21:50:53] <jwr> i see in this example https://stackoverflow.com/a/37898591 how i can mount a directory from the host and exclude a subdir of that directory, but in that example the excluded subdir is empty. i'm looking for something like COPY --from=prod-image /app/vendor/bundle /app/vendor/bundle`, but i need to be able to do it as part of running the local dev container.
[21:52:35] <rawtaz> the COPY is for the build step so it wont help you much i think (?)
[21:53:11] <rawtaz> but is your dev env outside of the container?
[21:53:36] <rawtaz> if i make a dev env for a project i keep it entirely in the container, and only the source code outside of there

[21:54:53] <jwr> yes, that's my intention too. the entire app stack should exist in the container, with only the source code bind mounted between the host and the container as /app. which works fine but doesn't reuse the gems that are installed inside the image at /app/vendor/bundle.
[21:54:55] <ada_> copy the gem folder to teh host
[21:55:03] <ada_> mount the gem folder to the dev container just like the SO example

[21:55:49] <ada_> you could do the exact same thing as the SO post and just copy your gem files into the named volume, and then it wouldn't be empty
[21:56:25] <ada_> but it's not an "exclude" operator, you're just using nested mounts and the OUTCOME makes it look like you excluded something.  it's not excluded, there's just another mount on top of that subfolder that just so happens to be empty
[21:57:01] *** Joins: Tach (~Tach@user/tach)
[21:57:10] <ada_> if you have an image with the right gems in it, run a container from that image and you could use 'docker cp' to copy the /app/vendor/bundle folder to the host
[21:57:18] <rawtaz> jwr: i dont get why it wouldnt reuse the gems. what is it that needs to use the gems? your IDE? doesnt that run inside the container?
[21:58:52] <jwr> rawtaz: the entrypoint of the image is `bundle exec rails server`, which expects gems to be installed in /app/vendor/bundle, and they are installed there in the image but the bind mount of the source code at /app tramples over /app/vendor/bundle.
[21:59:46] <jwr> ada_: i think i get what you are saying. the intermediate step of running a container and copying the gems out into the host is doable. good thought, thank you.
[21:59:51] <rawtaz> jwr: but then simply put your gems or your source code in different places? :D
[22:00:29] <rawtaz> what youre doing now is like installing something in a given path on your computer, then mounting an external hard drive onto the same path, and expecting the installed stuff to still be accessible

[22:02:13] <tabakhase> cgroup can do that if you wanted tho :P
[22:02:14] <rawtaz> jwr: have you considered a softlink in there somewhere?
[22:02:54] <rawtaz> e.g. bindmount the source into /src then make a symlink to that somewhere in /app (i dont know how rails app structure is workable)

[23:55:59] <gajus> currently I have a script that runs in CI: yarn config set npmScopes.contra.npmAuthToken $foo
[23:56:06] <gajus> The problem is that in CI logs that value of $foo is expanded, i.e. it logs yarn config set npmScopes.contra.npmAuthToken "my-secret-token"
[23:56:09] <gajus> CI = Docker
[23:56:15] <gajus> is there a way to hide it?
[23:56:25] <gajus> #bash channel suggested using set -x
[23:56:36] <gajus> checking if this is valid option in the context of Docker
