[00:00:07] <kepstin> a few filters have some commands to alter some of their settings dynamically which might be easier to use in a program with the api
[00:00:46] <Terrence> How do you check that? Is it in the source code of the filter?

[17:07:04] <DHE> input codec doesn't matter. focus on a tutorial meeting your *output* needs
[17:07:29] <gnoo> You can try converting some other videos before then learn to minimize conversion loss on them before trying actual impkrtant

[17:53:18] <BtbN> I don't think -1 is valid there
[17:54:13] <babyface> -1 is for removing metadata and chapters from the source
[17:54:36] <BtbN> Well, it seems to interpret it as indepentend option

[17:55:05] <BtbN> all says 0-based stream index
[17:56:20] <DHE> let me guess... you put -rf64 between -map_metadata and -1 ?

[17:57:47] <babyface> I need to add -rf64 because of the large size of the output .wav file

[18:11:19] <BtbN> You didn't mistype the -i as -1, did you?
[18:23:30] <babyface> blerd, you're right the correct thing to type is "-rf64 auto"
[18:23:56] <babyface> I can't find any info about this on the ffmpeg website though

[18:28:50] <anchovy> hrm. vlc can handle it so the data /is/ there and it's mostly sane.
[18:31:14] <babyface> furq, ffmpeg -h muxer=wav is great info but why isn't it on the website?
[18:33:43] <blerd> anchovy: maybe it isn't reading the format correct. You can try forcing it with -f. something like... ffmpeg -f mpeg -i VTS_01_1.VOB
[18:42:13] <anchovy> blerd: thanks. that seems to have done it :) it's the obvious solution, really, which explains why I was blind to it :)
[18:42:56] <anchovy> blerd: you may have saved the only video we have of my grandmother so happy days :)

[22:25:23] <simbulu> Pardon if this a stupid question. Downloaded the source. Unpacked it. Ran './configure --enable-gpl --enable-version3 --enable-nonfree' && make && make && sudo make install. Most of it looked ok to me, and indeed now /usr/local/bin/ contains ffmpeg and ffprobe. BUT ffplay is not there  - it has not been compiled at all despite 'fftools/ffplay.c'  does exist.
[22:25:32] <simbulu> What am I missing ?
[22:26:04] <JEEB> you really don't need nonfree if you've not enabled any features that cannot be redistributed

[22:27:57] <simbulu> oh - I do have SDL2, but not SDL2-devel. Let me change that and try again.
[22:28:40] <JEEB> Blacker47: the stats file paths are just passed to libx264 so even if you did set them it's not really FFmpeg that's controlling that

[22:30:07] <Blacker47> seems to happen at the end of second pass.
[22:31:33] <JEEB> which sounds like the amount of frames or something doesn't match between them?
