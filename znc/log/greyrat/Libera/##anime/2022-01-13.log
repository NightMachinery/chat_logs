[04:55:13] <Nanobot> pointed to my "no soliciting" sign, said I put it there for a reason, and told them to leave.
[04:55:55] <Nanobot> And they still kept trying to talk about electric bills, even as I closed the door on them.
[04:56:43] <Nanobot> I'm so far past being polite anymore.

[05:02:45] <Fenderbassist> Nanobot: you and me both, in regards to having them show up over and over, and I have a No Soliciting Sign too, feel your frustration
[05:03:08] <Fenderbassist> I stopped answering the door cause normally I don't have visitors
[05:04:35] <Nanobot> Fenderbassist: Unfortunately, I can't just not answer the door. My family has a way of getting super paranoid, and if my mom tries to call me and I don't answer (usually because I always have terrible reception in my house), she'll drive over and knock on my door, worried that I'm dead. If I don't answer the door, windows *will* be broken.
[05:04:48] <Fenderbassist> that I can totally understand
[05:05:02] <Fenderbassist> was same for me with cell phone, having kids I need to be reachable all the time
[05:05:12] <Fenderbassist> unfortunately friends would message me day and night with stuff I didn't need
[05:05:18] <Fenderbassist> but I couldn't turn cell off
[05:05:23] <Fenderbassist> so I got a house phone instead lol
[05:05:27] <MootPoot> Nanobot: cheap ip camera with calling functionality? 
[05:05:28] <Fenderbassist> no more 3am texts
[05:05:58] <Fenderbassist> I got a different cell number but I leave it off until I leave the house, and most don't have that number
[05:05:59] <Nanobot> MootPoot: That's just more stuff to maintain. I'll just answer the door in a mask and yell at anyone who doesn't belong there.
[05:06:26] <Fenderbassist> Nanobot: you need a Nerf super squirter water rifle kids toy to spray solicitors :)
[05:06:29] <ButterNoodle> my door sign says no soliciting.  do not disturb unless you have a warrant or you are christ returning
[05:06:40] <Fenderbassist> ButterNoodle: nice
[05:06:46] <Nanobot> Fenderbassist: I think that might actually be illegal.
[05:06:53] <MootPoot> Idk, I've started doing that
[05:06:56] <Fenderbassist> oh well
[05:07:05] <ButterNoodle> yea thats assault
[05:07:05] <MootPoot> Nothing to maintain once it's there
[05:07:07] <Fenderbassist> I don't want you to do it if it's illegal
[05:07:19] <Nanobot> I think it could be considered assault
[05:07:20] <ButterNoodle> might as well shoot them at that point
[05:07:28] <Fenderbassist> ButterNoodle: bummer
[05:07:34] <Fenderbassist> nevermind my bad joke idea then
[05:07:41] <ButterNoodle> *you'd probably get the same amount of jail time
[05:07:46] <Fenderbassist> that would suck
[05:07:51] <Fenderbassist> can they dust for water? :)

[05:08:54] <Fenderbassist> I have no TV

[05:09:39] <ButterNoodle> my cameras are all isolated.. so they dont phone home to the motherland - although they want to
[05:09:51] <Fenderbassist> ah
[05:10:00] <Fenderbassist> I can see that being annoying
[05:10:08] <ButterNoodle> I remember when I returned an ip camera bc it was trying to phone home to china
[05:10:15] <ButterNoodle> now they all do
[05:10:38] <Fenderbassist> I suppose it's part of the penalty for depending on China for our electronics and pharmaceuticals
[05:10:45] <Fenderbassist> and other things
[05:10:55] <Fenderbassist> anyway, how you doin lately?
[05:11:09] <ButterNoodle> yea not their fault they make shit cheaper than we can...

[10:45:21] <amigojapan> Lag? Ouch HubertFarnsworth 
[10:45:27] <sentionics> ah, I see. I recall those. I've never personally used em'. They restrict to just html and css right?
[10:45:43] <Matt|home> im trying hard to get rid of some of my favorite clothes.. a lot of them got slaughtered and torn up from wear and tear and a faulty washing machine.. they weren't cheap..
[10:45:55] <amigojapan> sentionics: you can use JavaScript
[10:46:17] <HubertFarnsworth> yes amigojapan, some milliseconds to second lag for messages to appear and send
[10:46:33] <HubertFarnsworth> it's fine though
[10:46:46] <sentionics> Ugh, my nasal breathing is so jacked up right now... but switching to just breathing through my mouth mostly is helping me stay coolheaded. Freaking antihistamine medicine was a bad idea.
[10:47:00] <amigojapan> I see HubertFarnsworth later I may ask you how to do it
[10:47:03] <sentionics> It was just a regular dose of alka seltzer night.
[10:47:16] <HubertFarnsworth> sure amigojapan 
[10:47:23] <sentionics> 12.5 grams of doxamaline I think it comes to.
[10:47:36] <sentionics> or is that mg, I can't remember.
[10:47:46] <HubertFarnsworth> is there [m] beside my name amigojapan?
[10:47:59] <amigojapan> They is not HubertFarnsworth 
[10:48:47] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: good, it kept me online all night, just like bnc services
[10:49:02] <amigojapan> Nice HubertFarnsworth 
[10:49:11] <sentionics> ah, it's 6.25mg doxymaline succinate per tablet. The dose is two tablets though. Can't wait for this to wear off.
[10:50:07] <amigojapan> sentionics: it would suck if you are allergic to antihistamines
[10:50:12] <sentionics> Had a full on panic attack for a few minutes over this earlier, lmao. But squared that away easily enough, now I'm merely a mouthbreather.
[10:53:04] <sentionics> amigojapan: I've had 1000x worse than this experience. I get panic attacks when I get high, particular weed that produces a body high (which is pretty much all edibles that I know of). I took 4 times what the dispensary told me I should start with. I was in a state of panic and intense anxiety all night long. Morning was the biggest relief ever ha ha.
[10:53:48] <sentionics> (well, if I'm drunk and get high, I sometimes do ok, but body highs in general really do me wrong, anxiety-wise)
[10:54:33] <amigojapan> sentionics: you should avoid weed
[10:54:55] <sentionics> Yeah, I've not touched it since the aforementioned experience, which was early last year
[10:55:11] <amigojapan> Ok
[10:55:39] <sentionics> wait, no, I take that back. I took a hit from a pipe last fall. Panic attack again. But uh, I was already in really bad shape as I was days into a bender.
[10:56:07] <amigojapan> sentionics: weed advocates will often say there can be nothing wrong with it, which is not true for everyone
[10:56:13] <sentionics> I don't know what that weed was, but he had something strong, it hit me quick.
[10:56:31] <sentionics> well, it depends on the mind of the person.
[10:57:08] <amigojapan> sentionics: alchohol is a safer drug than weed
[10:57:19] <mixfix41> its kinda like arguing bad trips exists
[10:57:20] <sentionics> most people probably do fine with it, heck, I did fine with it until my apparently dormant anxiety issues surfaced I guess? I don't know. Depends on your potential for mental disorders or something if I had to guess.
[10:58:01] <sentionics> of course, my good times with weed were always when I was already drunk.
[10:59:47] <sentionics> that's definitely the aspect of covid I fear immensely, the difficulty breathing symptom. That's like a phobia for me (which is why this nasal weirdness is making me on edge).
[11:01:13] <sentionics> interestingly enough, my cousin who got his booster a few weeks ago said he had difficulty breathing from the side effects. My side effects didn't include that... so maybe if I get a breakthrough infection, it might not include that symptom. fingers crossed.
[11:02:30] <mixfix41> i was reading on the subreddit herman cain awards. if you have a swollen lymph nodes it could decide youre fate. maybe the health of ones lymph nodes effects symptoms one has too
[11:03:30] <sentionics> mixfix41, yeesh. list of things I don't want to experience.
[11:03:53] <sentionics> isn't that from like thyroid issues or something

[14:22:25] <amigojapan> At least one person could read my schematics
[14:26:53] <HubertFarnsworth> sure amigojapan, it's easy to understand from the video itself
[14:27:36] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: you need to build the hardware, for which you need the schematics on my web page
[14:31:27] <HubertFarnsworth> I don't think hardware is the hard part amigojapan 
[14:32:00] <HubertFarnsworth> at least for me as I already know all those things
[14:32:09] <amigojapan> Alright HubertFarnsworth . The hard part was making the basic interpreter which is what I did
[14:32:25] <HubertFarnsworth> writing a basic interpreter is new for me
[14:32:37] <amigojapan> Right
[14:32:53] <HubertFarnsworth> and writing that piece of code in that small memory of atmega8 is tough
[14:33:08] <HubertFarnsworth> what did you use? atmega32 or atmega32?
[14:33:15] <HubertFarnsworth> atmega8*
[14:36:57] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I got many hints from diamondi spinelli basic interpreter (which was obfuscated, and seems to have disappeared from the internet

[20:18:10] <Bco1981> MootPoot: i have never had to use that kind of usb passthrough. i know a friend has a steamlink box and it can passthrough his controller to his pc. but it didn't work with a original Oculus Rift CV1

[20:36:28] <mixfix41> maybe stream it and then it can be useful for developers in this day and age
[20:36:54] <mixfix41> archive it too since twitch only gives you 14 days or record desktop and archive without twitch
[20:37:15] <hi117> they don't care
[20:37:18] <hi117> they made their money

[20:38:06] <mixfix41> all right
[20:38:10] <mixfix41> 8-D
[20:39:06] <hi117> its just sad when a indy game is mechanically more polished than a AAA game with simpler mechanics
[20:40:11] <mixfix41> how many games do you own on steam
[20:40:36] <mixfix41> total including gog i have only like twenty
[20:40:43] <mixfix41> there all good games i dont even touch em tho
[20:40:52] <mixfix41> i gota find some time sometime
[20:40:56] <hi117> 175 according to steam
[20:41:11] <mixfix41> damn well now i know you know more
