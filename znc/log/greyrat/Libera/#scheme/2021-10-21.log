[18:05:41] <Zipheir> rudybot: It's a cult!
[18:06:18] <rudybot> Zipheir: So it's like worrying that the weird isolationist cult is slightly noisier than it was a month ago.
[18:08:06] <amazigh> maybe it is just travel laptop, last time in 2019 or something, they had an old laptop with missing keyboard caps.
[18:08:27] <amazigh> I can not imagine coding with missing caps
[18:12:06] <Zipheir> That doesn't sound pleasant.
[18:12:47] <lampilelo> what would you rebind ctrl to if there was no caps lock?
[18:13:25] <Franciman> I would not use emacs altogether
[18:13:30] <Franciman> so no need to use ctrl compulsively
[18:14:03] <Franciman> lampilelo: that's a hard question, caps lock is very attractive
[18:15:09] <amazigh> what is this caps lock trick ?
[18:15:15] <Zipheir> I actually have CapsLock bound to Esc/Meta...
[18:15:26] <ecraven> lampilelo: just use a proper keyboard with thumb keys ;)
[18:15:56] <Zipheir> Sounds like typing on a mbira.

[22:11:06] <gwatt> My current and previous job both give macbooks to devs.
[22:11:25] <jcowan> Just so
[22:12:00] <gwatt> Seems to be pretty common for companies these days, at least in the US
[22:12:25] <Zipheir> I try to avoid walled gardens, and I'm a little surprised when people with some kind of "hacker mentality" don't.
[22:12:40] <jcowan> The number of Yellow votes is growing: keep those cards and letters coming in, folks!
[22:13:48] <Zipheir> That's good.  I noticed there were already 8 as of a few days ago.
[22:14:24] <gwatt> Zipheir: I don't use the work computers for personal stuff (except to connect to IRC), but it's easier to just use the provided computer with all the certs, VPN, etc set up than try and figure it out on a personal computer
[22:14:42] <jcowan> I mostly use the command line + Chrome + LibreOffice + the Slack client for work + occasionally Coteditor (for plain text), so I am using the Mac as openly as possible.
[22:14:52] <jcowan> Double that now
[22:15:27] <gwatt> I did try to dual-boot linux at one point, but it just wasn't worth it. Linux has never been that good on mac hardware
[22:19:23] * jcowan nods.
[22:20:03] <jcowan> A cow orker of mine actually uses Linux on a PC, but he lives entirly in the Python back end.
[22:20:53] <gwatt> that sounds reasonable.

[23:36:46] <mdhughes> Well, the alternatives are Linux, which is hot garbage, and BSD, where you have to write almost everything on the desktop yourself, or Windows, which is almost as bad as Linux… or a nice Mac.
[23:37:14] <mdhughes> It's a UNIX with a good GUI. What else did you want?

[23:41:47] <mdhughes> My tolerance for religious nonsense has dropped to basically zero, so that's not a valid argument with me anymore.

[23:47:09] <mdhughes> S'allright!
