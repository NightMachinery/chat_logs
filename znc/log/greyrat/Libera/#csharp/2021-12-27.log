[00:00:07] <sonny> if i have to, probably qt or some such toolkit
[00:00:48] <sonny> the issue is pervasive as well, but it might be easier to solve in win32
[00:01:02] <sonny> it was dissapointing to learn
[00:01:16] <bomb> Qt is no go man. Qt company is trying to get rid of its FOSS community
[00:01:36] <sonny> that it would require such invesment means it is not a good api imo (I have little experience)
[00:02:05] <bomb> if you ask me. WPF checks all the boxes.
[00:02:12] <sonny> kde community said they have the ability to fork qt if the need arises
[00:02:20] <sonny> wpf has the same issues
[00:02:37] <bomb> built on top of binding. XAML is productive. has 2D/3D graphics built-in
[00:02:47] <sonny> with regards t making a text editor or ide
[00:03:02] <bomb> KDE doesn't have the power to maintain Qt on its own
[00:03:26] <sonny> well that's your opinion vs theirs at this point
[00:03:49] <bomb> Qt funds KDE
[00:04:01] <sonny> I'm guessing you get a canvas for 2D/3D graphics?
[00:04:20] <sonny> yes, xaml is a step in the right direction
[00:05:14] <sonny> JavaFX is another capable toolkit
[00:05:37] <bpmedley_> sonny : Have you seen Avalonia?
[00:05:40] <bomb> if you're okay with Java, of course
[00:06:15] <sonny> bpmedley_ no, I am reading about this now
[00:06:50] <bpmedley_> sonny : The main issues are mobile and lack of commercial or abundant widgets.  If the base set works for you, then you might really enjoy Avalonia.
[00:06:52] <sonny> jetbrains has a new ide, I wonder if they used this technology
[00:07:13] <bomb> nope
[00:07:37] <sonny> how do you know?
[00:07:39] <bomb> they're migrating from Swing to Swing/JetPack hybrid
[00:07:52] <sonny> and my word this documentation is so much better already
[00:07:54] <bpmedley_> sonny : https://icons8.com/lunacy <-- Avalonia
[00:08:13] <bpmedley_> sonny : I should have stated.  The main issues when I tried are: mobile and lack of commercial widgets.
[00:08:27] <bomb>    https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-mpp/
[00:09:01] <sonny> bpmedley_ not sure what that link is for
[00:09:13] <bpmedley_> sonny : A well received app built with Avalonia.
[00:09:17] <sonny> ah
[00:10:21] <sonny> bomb so it's react native?
[00:11:17] <sonny> bpmedley_ I prefer avalonia just from a documentation perspective already, but I suspect the same problem will persist for me there
[00:11:42] <sonny> I'm not focused on mobile at all, just wanted to tinker with native widgets
[00:11:44] <bpmedley_> sonny : I joined the conversation late.  What is the original problem?
[00:12:14] <bpmedley_> Avalonia has the same look and feel across all platforms.  Not exactly native..
[00:13:04] <sonny> ah rip

[00:19:02] <sonny> bpmedley_ if I was in a bind, yeah probably
[00:19:08] <sonny> but the goal was to make my own
[00:19:21] <bpmedley_> Got it, understood..
[00:20:03] <sonny> yeah I had this idea for an s-expression editor, to make some type of emacs like software

[03:26:29] <bomb> it's easier than it looks, and the skill will be with you forever
[03:26:55] <Tobbi> I gotta ask you a question: If your boss suddenly asked you to document your system (and to ask another senior coworker for guidance), would that make you worried?
[03:27:00] <bomb> studies show that guitarists bang more chicks than computer programmers.

[03:27:30] <bomb> aren't you in Germany? nobody fires programmers there. and if they do, you can find a new one in 15 minutes.

[03:30:12] <bpmedley_> Tobbi : What is wrong with your employment history?

[03:31:03] <Tobbi> bpmedley_: first job was a working student thing for a company where I just didn't click...they put me under a lot of pressure and didn't give me the resources to succeed... I gave up because It wasn't going anywhere.

[03:31:28] <Tobbi> And I've had that for...almost 4 years now

[03:43:09] <Tobbi> Ah, yeah...
[03:43:27] <Tobbi> But that doesn't change anything about the fact that...the whole thing is incredibly mundane.
[03:43:34] <Tobbi> Maybe I just need to make some changes in my life.
[03:43:35] <Tobbi> IDK
[03:43:57] <bpmedley_> What I've noticed is that all fields become mundane that build on incremental improvement.
[03:45:27] <Tobbi> Probably.
[03:47:02] <Tobbi> And maybe focusing on a job as a source of fun and fulfillment is the wrong thing to do.

[08:27:48] <wodencafe> What does this mean "public static ClassName A => new ClassName();" using the lambda rather than assignment?
[08:28:47] <bomb> it means C# being smart ass for no apparent reason?
[08:29:57] <wodencafe> I don't know what that means.
[08:30:25] <wodencafe> What is the difference between the former and "public static ClassName A = new ClassName();"?

[18:41:11] <bomb> cool
[18:41:20] <bomb> starting a YouTube channel?
[18:45:06] <_Shurik_> I need to learn how to fly that bastard first
[18:45:18] <_Shurik_> it goes up to almost 90 mph
[18:45:27] <bomb> 90 mph
[18:45:28] <bomb> no shit?
[18:46:23] <_Shurik_> bomb: yeah! I'm kinda scared a bit even
[18:47:03] <_Shurik_> FAA imposes limit of 100 mph for any drone, so it's just below that
[18:50:54] <bomb> you still need a license, right?
[18:51:09] <_Shurik_> bomb: no.  Just FAA registration
[18:51:21] <bomb> ah cool
[18:51:24] <_Shurik_> without license I'm limited to 500 feet altitude
[18:51:44] <bomb> I'd get the license
[18:52:16] <bomb> I love drone imagery

[18:56:44] <bomb> holy shit, is that where you live?
[18:57:06] <_Shurik_> No, it's about 2 hours of drive north

[18:57:52] <bomb> aye, cool
[18:58:13] <bomb> these would make great music videos
[18:58:22] <_Shurik_> very nice motorcycle roads there too. Nothing but curves
[18:58:53] <bomb> what's that tower @ 7:30?
[18:59:04] <_Shurik_> Cell tower
[18:59:19] <_Shurik_> I'm surprised it didn't knock out my comm with drone
[18:59:42] <bomb> but the first one was much bigger?
[18:59:53] <bomb> the one you climbed in the beginning
[18:59:57] <_Shurik_> let me see what you're talking about
[19:00:27] <_Shurik_> aaaah that one
[19:00:34] <_Shurik_> it's just a water tower
[19:00:47] <bomb> ha. modern design :)
[19:01:02] <_Shurik_> bomb: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egmlhHMD5L4
[19:01:15] <_Shurik_> and these are motorcycle rides we take here.  Very pretty in the mountains
[19:02:01] <bomb> gotta finish the drone video first. I love watching such videos :)
[19:02:39] <_Shurik_> bomb: yeah, I love those too.  And they are in freaking 4k
[19:05:03] <bomb> you know, you can actually turn this into a job
[19:05:23] <_Shurik_> bomb: oh here, you would like this one
[19:05:45] <_Shurik_> It's a video from where I used to work - Racine, Wisconsin
[19:05:48] <_Shurik_> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03YoeBknyfA
[19:06:02] <_Shurik_> I really liked that little town
[19:06:51] <_Shurik_> Lake Michigan
[19:08:30] <_Shurik_> My camera work is not really good, was still getting used to the drone at that time
[19:11:22] <bomb> ayy
[19:11:27] <_Shurik_> I really should always put it into cinematic mode, it guarantees smooth transitions and turns
[19:11:37] <bomb> it's also editing that shines a shoot
[19:11:52] <bomb> people remove harsh tuns and such
[19:11:58] <bomb> *turns in the video
[19:11:58] <_Shurik_> true, I could cut out that stuff
[19:12:08] <_Shurik_> that was a raw footage
[19:12:35] <bomb> yeah, give davinci resolve a try. also helps with color and such
[19:13:00] <_Shurik_> what's that?
[19:13:34] <bomb> video editing software, runs on win/mac/nix
[19:14:08] <_Shurik_> ah, ok.  I use Shotcut
[19:14:25] <_Shurik_> bomb: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3MZZmXga4A
[19:14:27] <bomb> are you on Linux?
[19:14:34] <_Shurik_> Last one, from Costa Rica
[19:14:38] <_Shurik_> no, Windows
[19:14:56] <bomb> Shotcut works well there? cool
[19:15:05] <_Shurik_> oh yeah, I love it
[19:15:50] <_Shurik_> So my drone has this software bug/feature that doesn't allow it to take off anywhere below equator
[19:15:54] <bomb> very cool video. yeah just removing the fast head turns would do the trick
[19:16:12] <_Shurik_> and I couldn't get it fly when I was in Brasil last year... that was so dissapointing
[19:16:44] <bomb> so how is the new one different from this?
[19:16:48] <bomb> better camera, I suppose
[19:17:01] <_Shurik_> new one is really for racing
[19:17:15] <_Shurik_> this one is better for videos because it is fully gamble stabilized
[19:17:15] <bomb> hah
[19:17:57] <_Shurik_> it's freaky shit, it moves camera like chicken moves it head
[19:18:30] <bomb> lol, so you're gonna use it when riding a bike?
[19:19:06] <_Shurik_> you know, I was really considering it.  There is a "follow me" mode on it
[19:19:18] <_Shurik_> but I'm afraid it would fly into something
[19:19:52] <_Shurik_> I just don't want to destroy $700 drone while fucking around :)
[19:19:53] <bomb> lol imagine it starts stalking some other biker
[19:20:12] <_Shurik_> hahaha
[19:20:32] <_Shurik_> no but tech is amazing.  You can put it into gesture mode and control it with hand signals
[19:20:49] <_Shurik_> go up, go down, go back, folow me

[19:22:37] <bomb> lol
[19:25:15] <bomb> I need to play my bass again, after like a year
[19:25:57] <bomb> I'm thinking a project, 4-piece rock band setup, but the rhythm guitar, lead guitar are also 4-string bass
[19:26:26] <_Shurik_> weird
[19:26:52] <bomb> well 21-fret bass with four string goes up to E4, I guess
[19:27:00] <bomb> that's enough for darker shoegaze sound I have in my mind
[19:28:45] <bomb> bass bass will just pick root and 5ths on the bottom string, rhythm bass will hit distorted 4th/5th power chords on the top two strings, lead bassist will go as high as possible on the fretboard w/ chorus, reverb, etc. pedals.
[19:29:24] <_Shurik_> I actually signed up for lead guitar lessons
[19:29:46] <_Shurik_> I think my sound on bass is good, now need to concur solo guitar
[19:29:54] <bomb> yeah, sorry to hear. but could be fun as a hobby :P
[19:30:16] <_Shurik_> Oh I'd never be musician for living
[19:30:45] <_Shurik_> nor I'd want to.  It's a shitty gig really
[19:30:57] <bomb> you'd never know man. you might end up in a band for fun, and one of your tracks might get viral on day
[19:31:40] <_Shurik_> if it does - it does.  I just know that I could never create something as amazing as Stairway to Heaven for example
[19:31:55] <_Shurik_> so, hobby it will be
[19:32:45] <bomb> Stairway to Heaven is a simple melody, though
[19:32:59] <bomb> the progressive arrangement, and the band's brand value, made it a masterpiece
[19:33:07] <_Shurik_> but it's absolutely amazing

[19:56:12] <_Shurik_> use it any chance I get
[19:56:27] <bomb> are 5 string ones usually have a low B instead of high C?
[19:56:44] <_Shurik_> always do
[19:57:23] <_Shurik_> never seen one with high C. 5 string are all about that extra punch
[19:57:42] <bomb> cool
[19:57:53] <_Shurik_> feels so good to drop lower then E
[19:58:04] <_Shurik_> gnarly sound
[19:58:45] <bomb> hehe
[19:58:51] <bomb> do you have a picture of your pedal board?
[19:59:05] <_Shurik_> for bass?
[19:59:22] <bomb> yeah
[19:59:36] <_Shurik_> I don't use one.  Just Gentz Benz and finger control.  I don't even use compressor
[19:59:57] <bomb> ha, just DI into the Mixer and you're done?
[20:00:13] <_Shurik_> well for recording I literally just DI
[20:00:24] <_Shurik_> on stage I go through Gentz Benz
[20:00:46] <_Shurik_> pre even
[20:00:52] <bomb> just the head to the PA, or cab too?
[20:00:55] <_Shurik_> so sound engineer can tweak whatever he wants
[20:01:00] <_Shurik_> and I use gentz as my monitor

[20:06:09] <_Shurik_> Hartke cab, Genz cab and Shuttle 6 head
[20:06:20] <_Shurik_> about 600 watts of total power

[20:09:16] <_Shurik_> I highly highly recommend you get one
[20:09:49] <_Shurik_> and head itself is absolutely weightless
[20:10:03] <_Shurik_> for 600 watt - you would be impressed
