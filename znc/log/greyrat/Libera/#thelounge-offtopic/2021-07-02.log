[00:01:39] <richrd> I'd really like to grab a TheLounge hoodie
[00:02:00] <MaxLeiter> do we have them?
[00:02:09] <MaxLeiter> oh we do have a threadless huh
[00:02:18] <richrd> Ye
[00:02:30] <MaxLeiter> I have no idea where that money winds up haha (assuming we're supposed to get a %)
[00:02:36] <MaxLeiter> I'll ask astorije
[00:04:18] <richrd> I could just buy one but i read that the store owner can get samples without paying the cut. That'd be nice as a contributor
[00:06:13] <richrd> But any case i could just buy one or two anyway. There like 40€ so not a big deal, but I'm also curious where the extra % goes 
[00:06:28] <MaxLeiter> yeah let me do some digging
[00:07:50] <PeGaSuS> wtf am I missing to donate again to TL?
[00:08:52] <MaxLeiter> please dont donate, we have plenty of cash right now 
[00:09:15] <MaxLeiter> but referencing https://thelounge.threadless.com/
[00:11:59] <PeGaSuS> those mugs are lovely..
[00:19:03] <aab_> lots of mugs
[00:19:12] <aab_> I would buy everything if only I had the cash ha
[00:24:08] <PeGaSuS> https://imgur.com/a/cIhl2km

[00:24:50] <PeGaSuS> so, thanks guys :D
[00:24:51] <aab_> aw man lol
[00:25:17] <aab_> should be a heat warming mug when it gets hot it goes white with a black logo that would be awesome
[00:25:26] <aab_> like reverse logo ha
[00:25:31] <PeGaSuS> haha
[00:25:38] <PeGaSuS> that would be awesome
[00:28:53] <PeGaSuS> and I'll eventually buy the white one xD
[00:29:16] <aab_> for a cup of tea and a cup of coffee at the same time
[00:29:27] <PeGaSuS> exactly! xD
