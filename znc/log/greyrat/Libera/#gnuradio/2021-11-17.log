[06:42:40] <patchvonbraun[m]> It's the attenuation on the prototype filter it generates.  I think it's linear, so default is "100" which is 20dB.
[06:43:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> But that's just a recollecton

[06:52:57] <linge93[m]> Hi,patchvonbraun I later observed the output of the schmid&cox ofdm synch module. I found that there was a judgment error from here on. I checked the output of "detect". The number of 1 was the same as the number of packets received subsequently, but it was less than the number of packets sent(that is, this module has a judgment error and it did not find the beginning of the data packet in the correct position) ,In addition, I did not add
[06:52:57] <linge93[m]> any channels, I used the "ZMQ" module to connect ofdm.tx and rx flow graph, so I think it has nothing to do with the channel 
[06:55:09] <linge93[m]> Is this a problem inherent in the ’schmid&cox ofdm synch‘ module itself? I'm not very sure

[07:28:18] <linge93[m]> patchvonbraun: Okay, thanks for your reply.
[07:28:44] <linge93[m]> Does anyone else have some research on the ‘schmid$cox ofdm sync’ module? When I use it, I find that it cannot correctly determine the start of the packet
[07:33:49] <drmpeg> @luisherasme The attenuation is in dB. So 100 dB is the default. It ultimately sets the number of taps in the filter.
[07:34:17] <drmpeg> Which is a low pass filter.
[07:34:42] <patchvonbraun[m]> drmpeg: 100dB seems....extreme
[07:35:23] <patchvonbraun[m]> I think I've set it to lower values in the past without any really negative consequences.  At least on other polyphase thingies.
[07:37:44] <drmpeg> It depends on the window. Look at gnuradio/gr-fft/lib/window.cc for values.

[16:28:32] <cpfig[m]> Hello, I am a newbie using GNU Radio in an university project. I've used the Filter Design Tool to design a filter and saved it to a file. But how can I use it in GNU Radio Companion?

[16:35:03] <willcode4[m]> cpfig: You usually re-create the filter in GRC using one of the filter blocks. It is also possible to cut/paste the taps from the filter design tool into the taps field for a filter in GRC.

[16:38:27] <cpfig[m]> willcode4[m]: Thanks. But where do I exactly find and paste the taps? I am using GRC 3.9.3.0 under Ubuntu
[16:38:47] <cpfig[m]> I cannot find a taps filter in the Band Pass Filter block, for example
[16:40:28] <willcode4[m]> If you use the Band Pass Filter (or Low Pass, etc.), you would specify the same parameters you used to create the filter in the designer. If you use one of the raw FIR/FFT filters, you specify the taps.
[16:42:33] <cpfig[m]> willcode4[m]: Ok, I will give it a go. Thanks
[16:44:34] <willcode4[m]> For the most part, think of the filter designer as a way to visualize the response of filters that you will specify using parameters in GRC.

[18:23:37] <Guest3690> i am writing a python block, but stuck at a point.

[18:39:21] <BarryDuggan[m]> Guest3690: since it's short, you can put it here, surrounded by three backticks, for example:

[19:14:00] <Yamakaja[m]> No ` = 0;` in your *_iml.h. You need to learn some C++ basics :)
[19:19:11] <jemius> It's a bit too late for that. I did not choose this language.
[19:19:47] <Yamakaja[m]> But you're trying to work with it ... doesn't really matter if you want to or not
[19:20:44] <jemius> I've not got time to learn the abstruse complexity of the fiever-dream stroustroup had when rampaging Dennis Ritchie's honourable work. I've got a week to get things to run, and literally all I want to do is link a function.
[19:21:29] <Yamakaja[m]> Okay, so could you show your current state please? And has the error message changed?
[19:22:33] <patchvonbraun[m]> I'll note that Stroustrups original vision was considerably easier to swallow than what it has turned in to. Even Dennis himself didn't think it was horrible.
[19:22:44] <miek> i have terrible news for you, that locale-dependant issue you had with stof was inherited from C!
[19:23:22] <jemius> Yamakaja[m],  I am not sure what the instructions are. so in _impl.h just = 0, without virtual, and in _impl.cc an override at the end...
[19:24:07] <jemius> miek, It's not news that everything is broken. And no, that issue only arises when cmake+clang in GR is invoked. GCC (g++) does not do that. But anyways...
[19:24:28] <Yamakaja[m]> jemius: Just go back and read them carefully, i think i told you exactly where to put stuff

[23:40:14] <neelpandeya[m]> <patchvonbraun[m]> "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/..." <- Congratulations!!  It's awesome that you and CCERA are getting some prominent visibility.
[23:41:10] <patchvonbraun[m]> Indeed, and the journalist didn't fark it up hopelessly.  The editing on the video is remarkably professional and smooth.

[23:44:52] <willcode4[m]> Is this a quiz? (1, 256).
[23:45:08] <patchvonbraun[m]> Numbers station....
[23:45:18] <Guest36> I am trying to read outputs a "head" block set to num_items = 7680 in a custom python block. len(input_items[0] ) is always giving 4096 as length.
[23:45:54] <Guest36> basically 7680 is getting divided as 4096+2048+1024+512 = 7680
[23:46:06] <willcode4[m]> That's ok.
[23:46:25] <Guest36> if i try to read values, only 4096 values are getting read. how to read all 7680 values?
[23:48:01] <willcode4[m]> Putting N samples into a flowgraph does not necessarily mean that N sample will come out the other end. There are a number of reasons why, but GR is not a calculator. It processes streams of data (and messages).
[23:48:39] <willcode4[m]> What are you trying to do?
[23:49:05] <Guest36> i am writing own custom python block. atleast i should be able to read all the input values right?
[23:49:26] <willcode4[m]> Don't know. Depends on what you are trying to do in that block.
[23:50:22] <willcode4[m]> What do you have in your flowgraph, and how are you running it?

[23:53:17] <Guest36>  basically i have signal source -> stream to vector -> FFT -> vector to stream -> head (num_items =7680) -> my_python_block -> vector sink . In python block i want to take 7680 values given by head block and do futher manipulation of these values accordingly. So basically i will be taking 7680 input values and give out output of 25 values. So
[23:53:18] <Guest36> writing a decimation python block.
[23:55:13] <Guest36> (7680/25) = 307.2    .I haven't set decim values = 307.2 yet., just proceeding with decim=1 at the moment. i am seeing error in reading "print(len(input_items[0]))" stage itself.

[23:58:37] <Guest36> willcode4[m]any suggestions?
[23:59:12] <willcode4[m]> A couple things can be happening. When a block finishes, it sends out "DONE" and shuts down the flowgraph. Also, there can be minimum numbers of items needed by a block (the FFT is a good example). There is also "history" where some blocks require some extra samples before they can process. Filters are a good example (and maybe FFTs).
