[12:10:13] <Isotopp> mooz: the command SHOW BINARY LOGS (previously SHOW MASTER LOGS) will do what you want
[12:10:37] <Isotopp> the output lists all existing binary log files, in 3 columns (previously 2 columns): file name, length in bytes and flag "encrypted"
[12:10:44] <Isotopp> | Log_name      | File_size | Encrypted |
[12:10:50] <Isotopp> | binlog.000323 |       201 | No        |
[12:11:45] <Isotopp> thumbs: using a mysqldump, the intermediate step is not necessary
[12:12:01] <Isotopp> for a binary upgrade, 5.6 -> 5.7 -> 8.0 and running mysql_upgrade at every step is required
[12:15:28] <fraff> hi #mysql, is there a query to see if an index is almost full, yesterday, an int index reached it's maximum value and it took us some time to figure out so I'd like to monitor that
[12:16:02] <Naktibalda> index or auto_increment field?
[12:16:22] <Isotopp> you want to check for primary key exhaustion on auto_increment fields.
[12:16:32] <Isotopp> there was an outage on github caused by thos once
[12:16:39] <Isotopp> and there is the https://vettabase.com/blog/monitor-auto-increment-usage/ article on the problem
[12:17:32] <Isotopp> it has a rather long query on i_s.tables and i_s.columns, but it is long only because of the rather large case statement in it
[12:18:22] <Isotopp> where i work we just had the same problem on some rather unmanaged postgres instance (the application business unit ran postgres, declined external support and did not monitor for this, then messed up their database trying to fix the problem badly)
[12:20:40] *** Quits: Furai (~Furai@furai.pl) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[12:21:24] <Isotopp> fraff: the github outage report in https://github.blog/2020-07-08-introducing-the-github-availability-report/ is interesting, because it hits on another problem. the contributing factor in their outage "May 5 00:45 UTC (lasting for two hours and 24 minutes)" was that they monitor primary key value exhaustion, but they had a bigint/int mismatch in a fk relationship.
[12:21:38] <Isotopp> that is a good find, and a thing to keep an eye on.
[12:23:55] <fraff> Isotopp: thanks for this answer, I have everything I need now

[13:37:37] <fraff> how do I select (very_complex_search) as simple_name where simple_name > 0 ? is it possible ?
[13:40:24] <Naktibalda> does you very complec search return single value?
[13:41:35] <Naktibalda> if it returns resultset, you can use subselect as table:  SELECT * FROM (very_complex_search) AS a WHERE a.field > 0
[13:42:41] <fraff> Naktibalda: single value
[13:46:10] <Naktibalda> anyway, that approach works

[19:32:34] <Naktibalda> you don't need subquery, join table directly
[19:33:03] <Naktibalda> from video JOIN video_like ON ...
[19:33:33] <nkm> can you show me? if you don't mind
[19:33:56] <Naktibalda> read join tutorial, try first example
[19:34:02] <Naktibalda> !t nkm joins
[19:34:02] <ubiquity_bot> nkm: Very basic join information: https://hashmysql.net/wiki/Introduction_to_Joins
[19:34:36] <Naktibalda> SELECT * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.a = t2.b;
[19:34:51] <nkm> ok
[19:34:56] <nkm> let me try
[19:35:04] <Naktibalda> add video fields and COUN(*) instread of *   and add GROUP BY and ORDER BY at the end
[19:36:12] <nkm> should I add type field instead of * ??
[19:37:19] <Naktibalda> what do you need type for?
[19:37:50] <nkm> type saves 0 or 1
[19:38:13] <nkm> type is like TYPE_LIKE = 1 TYPE_UNLIKE = 0
[19:38:16] <Naktibalda> please remind me what result do you want to get?
[19:38:37] <nkm> ok
[19:38:38] <nkm> I have 2 tables. video and video_like (fields: video_id, user_id, type (1 or 0) created_at). I want to get data from video table based on maximum number of likes (of video_like table)
[19:39:40] <Naktibalda> so you want to ignore unlikes, right?
[19:39:45] <nkm> yes
[19:40:02] <Naktibalda> add WHERE video_like.type=1
[19:41:54] <nkm> It gives this error
[19:41:55] <nkm> https://wtools.io/paste-code/b9WQ
[19:42:42] <Naktibalda> missed ON
[19:43:12] <nkm> yes
