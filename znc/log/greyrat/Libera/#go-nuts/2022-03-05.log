[08:02:11] <fizzie> Because in the module-oriented model, you don't use `go get` to install libraries into GOPATH, but instead the piece of code you're writing has its own go.mod file that lists its dependencies, and `go get` (or maybe more often, just writing the imports as if they existed and running `go mod tidy`) is used to manage that go.mod file.

[08:05:04] <fizzie> Some of the answers in that SO post do seem to be trying to explain making a module (the ones that mention `go mod init`), but all in all it's a very confusing thread, with about a 50:50 split of people recommending that, vs. people explaining how to re-enable GOPATH-style development, and none really clearly explains both options.
[08:05:36] <b0nn> johnjohn101: have a look at this https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module
[08:06:05] <johnjohn101> well it's not my module, so do i need to go back to author and have him fix?
[08:06:47] <fizzie> No, "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3" (or "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3/v2" for v2.* versions) is *already* a module.
[08:07:17] <fizzie> The question is how you'd *use* it in module-aware mode (GO111MODULE=on), and the way you'd use it is to put the code *you* want to write inside another module, which depends on it.

[08:09:01] <johnjohn101> well the download of that module didn't take place until i did the auto.
[08:09:30] <nitrix> johnjohn101, You misdiagnosed the problem and went down the wrong path so now you're confused. Your brand new project simply needs a `go mod init` to create a `go.mod` file. Then your `go get` will register dependencies within the project instead of globally for your machine.
[08:09:59] <johnjohn101> nitrix ok i will try again with a new project

[08:13:14] <nitrix> You shouldn't need any environment variables.
[08:13:33] <johnjohn101> so how do i delete the
[08:13:54] <johnjohn101> GO111MODULE
[08:14:22] <nitrix> Go modules have been the facto way of working with Go codebases since Go 1.13, it's turned on by default.
[08:14:33] <nitrix> In fact, it's getting removed in 1.18 to avoid people getting confused.
[08:15:11] <johnjohn101> that's just days away right?
[08:15:15] <fizzie> `go env -w` will have written the setting into the per-user configuration file, typically ~/.config/go/env. You can use `go env -u GO111MODULE` to unset it.

[08:16:21] <fizzie> Are you sure it's really getting removed in 1.18?
[08:17:11] <fizzie> https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.18 for example still has things like: "In GOPATH mode (with GO111MODULE=off), go get still builds and installs packages, as before."
[08:19:03] *** Joins: bluedust_ (~bluedust@103.165.167.61)
[08:19:09] <nitrix> fizzie, They were discussing that `go get` shouldn't install anymore and require a proper `go install`. Go 1.17 was going to deprecate it and Go 1.18 enforce it. Lots of go modules were supposed to go along with it.
[08:19:25] <nitrix> fizzie, I'm guessing Generics postponed things :/
[08:20:05] <nitrix> s/Lots of go modules/Lots of go modules intricacies/
[08:20:59] <b0nn> Not having it would mean that projects that are not modules cannot be installed
[08:21:07] <b0nn> That would hurt a lot of users
[08:21:07] <fizzie> The part of `go get` in module-aware mode no longer installing anything is in the 1.18 release notes (that's where the quote was from), I just don't think it was going to extend into further deprecating GOPATH mode.

[14:01:50] <xb0o2> What's the logic behind an end-bounded slice (e.g. bar := foo[:4]) inheriting the entire capacity of foo? I find it quite unintuitive and I can't think why you would want that behavior?
[14:05:03] <ricci> bar uses the same underlying array as foo, it doesn't allocate a new one
[14:08:05] *** Joins: Icedream (~icedream@hzn-b.serverkomplex.de)
[14:12:26] <ricci> this means that bar[0] = x will result in foo[0] being == x, and bar = append(bar, y) will result in foo[4] == y
[14:12:34] <ricci> use copy() if you want a copy
[14:14:23] <xb0o2> I appreciate that it uses the same underlying array. I'm saying it's slightly counterintuitive behaviour to end up with a slice of len(2), cap(3) (for example).
[14:16:07] <xb0o2> In the inverse where you're excluding items from the start of the slice (e.g. bar := foo [3:]) you end up with a reduced capacity to stop you from attempting to write off the end of the backing array.
[14:16:09] <xb0o2> Which makes sense.
[14:16:32] <xb0o2> I just don't see the logic behind the default behaviour being bar = foo[:3] ending up with a capacity > length
[14:16:53] <j416> no need to reallocate space
[14:16:58] <j416> as was mentioned
[14:17:19] <ricci> xb0o2: because the underlyin array actually *has* a greater capacity

[14:17:30] <xb0o2> Yes, I know that.
[14:17:56] <ricci> so what's the problem? it quite intuitive
[14:19:09] <j416> if the size of the underlying array was to be kept to the exact size of the slice at all times, that would mean a lot of reallocation, and it would lose one of the benefits of slices
[14:19:23] <j416> (being cheap)
[14:20:41] <xb0o2> j416: I'm not suggesting that at all.
[14:20:57] *** Joins: Icedream (~icedream@hzn-b.serverkomplex.de)
[14:20:58] <j416> then what?
[14:21:07] <xb0o2> I'm suggesting it would be more intuitive that the new slice, bar, have it's len and cap the same. Nothing to do with the original slice or the backing array.
[14:21:29] <xb0o2> So that the behaviour of...
[14:21:31] <xb0o2> a := []int{1,2,3}; b := a[:1]; b = append(b, 9);
[14:22:12] <ricci> then use copy(), but this needs reallocation
[14:22:22] <xb0o2> Would result in a still being 1,2,3 and b pointing to a newly allocated array somewhere else.
[14:22:28] <j416> xb0o2: cap is the size of the underlying array.
[14:22:39] <j416> lidless: len is the size of the slice.
[14:22:43] <j416> er, xb0o2 *
[14:22:51] <xb0o2> j416: That's not strictly true?
[14:23:02] <j416> it isnT?
[14:23:09] <xb0o2> a := []int{1,2,3}; b := a[1:];
[14:23:22] <xb0o2> The actual backing array of both has len(3), b has len(2)
[14:23:33] <j416> yes?
[14:24:08] <xb0o2> Sorry.
[14:24:13] <xb0o2> cap(3), cap(2)
[14:24:14] <xb0o2> :)
[14:24:16] <j416> right

[19:25:14] <pyzozord> hey, what does this sentence mean"Unless used through a variable of interface type, methods

[19:25:20] <pyzozord> "Unless used through a variable of interface type, methods can always be statically bound (they are not "virtual"), and incur no runtime overhead compared to an ordinary function."
[19:25:30] <pyzozord> I found it here https://github.com/golang/go/blob/18c5b488a3b2e218c0e0cf2a7d4820d9da93a554/doc/go_spec#L170
[19:29:28] <fizzie> I imagine it means what it says. If you have a method call expression like `x.Foo()`, if the compile-time ("static") type of x is not an interface type, the concrete implementation of Foo() that's relevant is the one defined on the known type of x, and the situation is not any different from an ordinary function call (doesn't need an extra lookup through a vtable or something). Contrast C++ and
[19:29:30] <fizzie> its `virtual` vs. non-`virtual` methods on a class.
[19:31:26] <mickey> i wish there was something like python's pandas for go :(

[19:35:36] <fizzie> There's been some attempts, but I don't think anything has really stuck. I guess Gota (https://github.com/go-gota/gota) is the one most closely inspired by Pandas? Just like Gonum's attempting to be the "NumPy of Go".

[22:02:05] <Garb0> andlabs: I *think* it's due to some insane-default misconfig wizardry due to gccgo, mingw 686, go-gcco and go-golang all installed at once
[22:03:01] <Garb0> i swear to god debian based dists are nothing but trouble, think im gonna retry building on Arch to see if it works. PS, i tried running on both fish and bash to avoid env blackmagickery, still nothing
[22:03:23] <fizzie> I gave it a little bit of a strace locally (since I've got MinGW installed), and to me it looked like the problem was, MinGW linker wrote the final output into a "testdll.exe", but then Go tried to look for it without the file extension: https://0x0.st/oPOd.txt

[22:04:47] <fizzie> Heh, that actually worked here.
[22:05:11] <fizzie> (Well, generated a file, anyway.)
[22:06:11] <fizzie> In fact, `-o testdll.dll` worked as well. It's only with no -o or with `-o <something with no dot>` that it fails to work.
[22:06:26] <andlabs> ah yeah, automatic extensions by windows linkers
[22:06:33] <Garb0> I... it fucking works?
[22:06:38] <Garb0> it did work lmao.
[22:06:47] <andlabs> I forgot all about that on linux
[22:06:55] <Garb0> Why, rob pike? WHY?
[22:07:19] <andlabs> because historically DOS and windows commands like to be "smart" and add extensions themselves

[22:11:51] <Nnavd> I'm trying to understand gos I/O handling in go routines. When long HTTP fetches are occurring, does golang consider that blocking IO and spin up other goroutines to continue work in place of that goroutine until the IO is done?
[22:12:35] <Nnavd> I'm just trying to optimize for an environment where there can be 1) very large fetches 2) long running jobs working on the results of the fetch

[23:48:52] <Garb0> ilpanda: when i use vscode what i do is simply open the terminal with F5
[23:48:55] <A_Dragon> Garb0: there is an official vscode plugin
[23:48:58] <A_Dragon> that works with gopls
[23:49:01] <A_Dragon> and delve
[23:49:04] <Garb0> and just go ahead and do a `go run whatever.go`
[23:49:22] <Garb0> try removing that and running it manually
[23:49:32] <A_Dragon> er, no
[23:49:58] <A_Dragon> if you want to debug with stdin, you'll need to either run delve outside, and tell vscode to connect to it headlessly over its socket, or use it that way normally a-la gcc
[23:50:36] <A_Dragon> also, see the linked issue
[23:53:00] <ilpanda> I was thinking of using delve. Now I see how it is done
