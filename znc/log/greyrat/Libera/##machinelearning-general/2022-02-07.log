[18:38:35] <dostoyevsky2> mefistofeles: can you explain Atomic Multipoles in layman terms?
[18:56:23] <mefistofeles> dostoyevsky2: oh so, you know how atoms have electrical charges, right? So, when you want to know the charge distribution (spatial) in a molecule you have to compute this using multipoles, because there are many atoms and charges moving around (multiple "poles")
[18:57:28] <mefistofeles> and this is commonly done with foundamental scientific models (form quantum mechanics) and this is very computationally expensive, but now they have developed a GNN to learn to compute these things
[18:57:43] <mefistofeles> which is computationally cheaper, at least once you have the model, as usual

[19:08:40] <mefistofeles> dostoyevsky2: not the shape, but how it will behave... from the shape you compute the charge distribution
[19:09:05] <mefistofeles> so that's why it makes sense using GNNs, I guess, because a molecule can be thought of a graph

Even, though, I always feel that the whole science of chemistry is based on statistical models anyways ;-)
[19:17:22] <mefistofeles> dostoyevsky2: oh, yeah, I guess... but it's very likely that these GNNs are not easily interpretable

[19:30:41] <dostoyevsky2> mefistofeles: but it's pretty interesting how some deep learning models can give you worthwhile research ideas that maybe even win you a nobel prize or something... simplyfing qm
