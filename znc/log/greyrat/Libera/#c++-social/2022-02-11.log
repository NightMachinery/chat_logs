[12:12:00] <Renderwww> the router/cable modem or whatever exactly those things are called has non trivial features, but none that I would care about!
[12:22:50] <Crocodillian> if you care about routers, you can ask your ISP to just use a cable modem, or switch your modem/router to bridge only mode if it supports that, and use an edgerouter
[12:23:13] <Crocodillian> but you can also do a lot of those functions with a pi on your network, well many of them
[12:25:27] <Crocodillian> note that edgerouters do not have wifi, you would use access points, the best ones are the unifi APs, unifi makes the edgerouter too
[12:25:33] <Crocodillian> unifi APs are fucking magic
[12:27:52] <Crocodillian> a unfi AP will give you full signal strength where those giant routers with huge antennas will give you nothing

[18:25:32] <Crocodillian> Renderwww: I was born in the soviet union and lived there until I was 9. And I, as well as many other people can tell you, that as horrible, inefficient and insane the soviet-style "communism" was, there were some advantages in society compared to US-style capitalism which is in most of the world right now. People valued other things more, like reading a good book. Were actually interested in
[18:25:34] <Crocodillian> things other than their bank accounts and acquiring bigger and shinier things. Things like a delicious chocolate were a more rare treat instead of being constantly bombarded with sensory overload.
[18:27:06] <Crocodillian> Renderwww: also conditions varied across the eastern block, and the 80s soviet union wasn't exactly gulags and executions like a lot of people who know nothing about it think
[18:30:34] <Crocodillian> Renderwww: also you could say that right now, the US government is far more horrible, inefficient and insane than the USSR was for most of its history, their advantage is that they don't control and ruin the economy and can just feed off it like a fucking cancer
[18:34:36] <Crocodillian> Renderwww: many people lived a simple happy life in the former soviet republics and parts of the eastern block. Right now in Russia the new fascist oligarchy created by US economic experts is trying to suppress the communists in parliament who are getting a lot more votes than they want.
[18:38:13] <Crocodillian> Russia has become the world ideological center of fascism.
[18:38:46] <jotham> holy fuck
[18:38:49] <jotham> can i just say
[18:39:03] <jotham> this channel used to be indulgent with exotica

[18:43:26] <jotham> i'm what, 42, and i've been here since i was 29, since blank discredited the original cpp network
