[17:19:48] <Arya[m]123> wow thats pretty cool
[17:19:55] <Arya[m]123> we need something like this here 
[17:25:02] <Arya[m]123> based af
[17:40:43] <Arya[m]123> https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/my-70-year-old-mother-has-been-using-linux-on-the-desktop-for-the-past-21-years.html
[17:40:53] <Arya[m]123> very nice article 
[18:09:39] <Tor[m]> <Arya[m]123> "https://www.unixsheikh.com/..." <- My mom used ms dos at her job before she was married and tbh 50 year old lady started using linux isn't shocking 
[18:09:47] <Tor[m]> But nice article
[18:10:09] <Tor[m]> But no dark mode :(
[18:26:34] <Arya[m]123> lol
[18:26:36] <Arya[m]123> darkreader

[19:21:18] <pystardust> Arya[m]123: gtlsgamr the vps is expiring today
[19:21:24] <pystardust> I told ramram too
[19:21:30] <Arya[m]123> yeah
[19:21:33] <Arya[m]123> forgot about that
[19:21:35] <Arya[m]123> renew it?
[19:22:45] <pystardust> Hmm, but we dont have much participation. Its only 3-4 people
[19:23:19] <Arya[m]123> ig we have to ask more people to help
[19:23:24] <pystardust> I can host the site on my vps
[19:23:44] <Arya[m]123> also i feel people wont like submitting patches via git patch
[19:24:19] <pystardust> But they can send the article's directly through md file na
[19:24:32] <pystardust> We dont need git if they feel intimidated
[19:24:39] <Arya[m]123> yeah but i feel many people are intimidated 
[19:24:57] <Arya[m]123> pystardust: gitea would be a good idea imo but its resource intensive
[19:25:13] <Arya[m]123> is it possible to take a snapshot of the server
[19:25:28] <pystardust> Yeah, we didnt do much tho, onyl valuable thing is our site
[19:25:31] <Arya[m]123> so if lot more people start coming in we can just restore bnack to the  prevfious form 
[19:25:33] <Arya[m]123> with a new vps
[19:25:43] <Arya[m]123> so we dont loose anything we did like mumble email etc.
[19:25:45] <pystardust> And thats anyways in our git so we can trash the vps
[19:25:57] <Arya[m]123> ok
[19:26:04] <Arya[m]123> how would people contribute then
[19:26:09] <Arya[m]123> just sending md files?
[19:26:20] <Arya[m]123> ig we can host it on gh
[19:26:33] <pystardust> Mumble is was to set up. Mail i just used luke smith script
[19:26:42] <Arya[m]123> oh k
[19:26:45] <pystardust> easy*
[19:26:56] <pystardust> Gitlab if needed
[19:27:05] <Arya[m]123> yup
[19:27:08] <Arya[m]123> codeberg.org
[19:27:15] <pystardust> Gh also anything, for bouncer ppl can use ircnow
[19:27:38] <Arya[m]123> is it possible to warn ppl using gli bouncer that its expired now?
[19:27:48] <Arya[m]123> many are using our znc right
[19:27:50] <pystardust> No one uses it :(
[19:27:56] <pystardust> Really?
[19:28:03] <Arya[m]123> a lot of them do
[19:28:08] <Arya[m]123> ramram wants to 
[19:28:11] <Arya[m]123> hemish does 
[19:28:14] <Arya[m]123> and a lot more
[19:28:17] <Arya[m]123> check the users list
[19:28:25] <pystardust> Oh
[19:28:26] <Arya[m]123> gtls registered a lot of ppl
[19:28:35] <Arya[m]123> can you share the user list  btw
[19:28:38] <pystardust> Ita till 10th
[19:28:45] <pystardust> Its*
[19:28:55] <Arya[m]123> oh k

[19:44:13] <pystardust> https://0x0.st/oiHA.txt
[19:44:28] <pystardust> these are the only ones with network configured, me and gtls don't use
[20:59:40] <hemish> i dont use znc from gnulinuxindia.org now
[20:59:48] <hemish> i use bnc4free.com
[21:00:05] <hemish> btw i can give some contribution through upi payment for vps renewal
[21:00:12] <hemish> like 50rs
[21:00:23] <hemish> i think we can ask ppeople to donate 1 rupee each
[21:00:25] <hemish> or maybe 10
[23:10:58] <pystardust> hemish: thanks hemish, but i think we can think out what we really need and have a plan sorted out before we host
