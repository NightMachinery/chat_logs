[00:54:33] <tomathy> yeh i considered operations non pushable but perhaps that was a mistake
[00:54:52] <GeDaMo> The operations act on the stack, they don't have to be pushed on it
[00:55:03] <tomathy> it's a really bad program but i had to make something to prove something to myself
[00:55:13] <tomathy> the stack has a size of 2 
[00:55:39] <vdamewood> Actually, operators acting on the stack rather than being pushed to it is a thing in many stack-based languages.

[02:34:20] <ProfSimm> With interfaces we run mostly into a namespacing problem, where two incompatible methods may end up with the same signature, something like that may occur with inheritance.
[02:34:49] <ProfSimm> I've been thinking about this. Maybe have object.{uniqueinterfaceid}.methodname() or something. But no one does that because it's be verbose as heck
[02:35:17] <nomagno> :D
[02:35:17] <nomagno> Namespacing can be done like so: NAMESPACE_InterfaceName
[02:35:24] <ProfSimm> I.e. keep every interface distinct, and then   interface X extends Y {things} is identical to interface X = {things} & Y
[02:35:35] <ski> "I think type algebra should be done only on interfaces/abstract types" -- yea .. my contention is that (statically typed, at least) OO languages tend to conflate and confuse things in this area. people tend to think of classes as some kind of type thing (in a static type system sense), where they're really more of a dynamic / run-time thing. basically, each class in Java *has* an associated type (which 
[02:35:42] <ski> is an interface, just like all object types). but the class itself is more or less identical to its constructor(s) (together with the method implementations)
[02:36:06] <ski> in FP terms, the OO constructor/class is basically just a function that returns a record (of method implementations)
[02:36:18] <ProfSimm> nomagno: for what I'm talking about it'd need to be more like interface Name { method InterfaceName_MethodName(); } :P

[02:41:31] <ProfSimm> And yet we need object to implement it. I.e. looks like a function but it's polymorphic method
[02:41:43] <ski> i like how the OO-system of OCaml does "static duck typing" in the sense that as long as an object supports the requisite methods (with compatible argument and result types), you can pass the object, no matter which class constructed it. (and you can make anonymous, one-off, objects, without bothing to make a class). although, i guess there may be some room for the nominal typing view of "an object of 
[02:41:49] <ski> this class type may only be constructed by the class, or a subclass thereof", namely for upholding invariants for abstract data types .. but possibly you could effect that in the usual modular way by keeping the full class type abstract, i think .. hm

[06:58:06] <ski> well, the preprocessor expanstion is a (conceptually) previous stage (even if it would happen interleaved with the parsing)
[06:58:31] <ski> so, the parsing we're talking about here needn't know about that. it just sees a stream of tokens
[06:58:40] <smallville7123> i know
[06:58:49] *** Joins: moniker- (~mon@dh207-123-204.xnet.hr)
[06:59:02] <ski> and it can rewind that stream (and, preferably, commit to not rewinding back past a given position)
[06:59:02] <smallville7123> but im using the parser in order to implement the preprocessor
[06:59:36] <smallville7123> so i dont need to reparse the same input several times
[06:59:45] <smallville7123> the entire input*
[06:59:52] <ski> whether the tokens from that past position to the current position are cached/buffered, or regenerated by the "previous" preprocessor, needn't really concern the parser much
[07:00:48] <smallville7123> also doing such would yeild lots of bugs
[07:01:15] <smallville7123> eg wne a macro gets expanded in a file that file should not be rescanned in it's entirety

[07:01:34] *** Quits: plastico (~plastico@neomutt/plastico) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[07:01:51] <ski> well, you have one stream of characters. presumably this is split into very rough tokens, for the preprocessor to recognize. then, that outputs another stream of tokens (possibly slightly more high-level, e.g. classified according to whether they're number literals, string literals, identifiers, particular symbols/operators, &c.) .. and then the main parser is fed that stream
[07:01:54] *** Parts: mtm49 (~mtm49@177.137.119.134) ()
[07:02:14] <smallville7123> yea
[07:02:35] <ski> (and all these stages can do their processing, interleaved with each other (like coroutines, or iterators, or, possibly, if you prefer, different threads or processes))

[07:04:31] <ski> smallville7123 : yea, so for each generated token from the preprocessor, you could associate the state that one'd need to revert to, should one want to rewind back to this token again

[07:06:19] <ski> or, which perhaps would be more efficient (and somewhat more involved), whenever the parser reaches a choice-point, it'd need to inform its input stream (which is connected to the preprocessor) that it might later want to rewind to the current position again, and then the preprocessor would just push *that* current state to an undo stack (rather than one for each token that's past the current commit

[12:01:50] <bayaz> Title: Packet switching - Wikipedia 
[12:01:59] <arahael> vdamewood: 1 Infinite Loop.
[12:02:08] <Decker> ARP is address resolution protocol - it's sorta like UDP - it broadcases 'who has 1.2.3.4' and if that ip exists, it replies with its hardware address
[12:02:33] <Decker> bridging just takes all packets from one side and relays to the other; it's really low overhead, vs routing
[12:02:42] <pyzozord> but in a ring network if I am a computer, when I receive a packet that is not addressed to me what do I do? Do I send it to all my links?
[12:02:59] <Decker> if bridged
[12:03:00] <pyzozord> isn't that going to very soon clog up the network if everyone does it?
[12:03:08] <Decker> usually it's dropped
[12:03:39] <Decker> or wouldn't go there, unless your computer lied and responed "12.3.4' is here" too... you can do RARP (responding ARP) flooding to switches and cause them to fail open
[12:03:43] <vdamewood> pyzozord: in a ring network, each node only has two connections anyway, so what comes in one ear goes out the other.
[12:04:05] <Decker> they often have a limited routnig table of'this mac is on this port' so if you flood the table so it can still work it has to fail to a hub mode and relay everything eveyrwhere
[12:04:37] <pyzozord> how about bus network?
[12:04:41] <vdamewood> Oh, I guess that's a difference between a switch and a bridge.
[12:04:50] <vdamewood> bus networks get clogged.
[12:05:07] <GeDaMo> All packets are on the bus
[12:05:09] <vdamewood> switches have switching tables. Bridges just pass everything through.

[12:12:36] <pyzozord> I see, so networking is really just "packets with different kinds of addresses all the way down" and "different startegies to send, receive and forward packets"
[12:12:40] <vdamewood> That $20 Netgear device you can only 'configure' by unplugging it to reset its table is not 'managed'.
[12:12:51] <vdamewood> Decker: Of course not. They're routers.
[12:13:07] <Decker> but  by your definition they're managed switches too
[12:13:27] <vdamewood> Decker: I said for a switch to be managed, not for a device to  be a managed switch.
[12:14:26] <vdamewood> If it's a router, it's not a switch. Though, a single device can have a router and a switch in the same package. This is often the case with a home router that has multiple ports for the home network.
[12:14:57] <vdamewood> The router connects to the switch internally.
[12:15:47] <vdamewood> Whether that switch is itself managed depends on whether the configuration interface can manage its switching table or other features.
[12:15:54] <Decker> :) does one say routers connect to swtiches when they are on the same circuit board? 
[12:16:23] <vdamewood> Decker: Does one say that a device is connected to a bus when it's on the same circuit board?

[15:33:44] <Rounin> vrp2zqL7: Normally, that would take the file you specified, create a compressed version of it in the same directory, and delete the original.
[15:33:53] <vrp2zqL7> What the?  Now the command is working on vmlinuz ...
[15:33:53] <bnchs__> vrp2zqL7, try gzip /tmp/test/zdrv_xenialpup7.5.sfs > zdrv_xenialpup7.5.sfs.gz

[15:34:28] <Rounin> vrp2zqL7: If it's compressing (and deleting) vmlinuz, your system could become unbootable... If you're running it with root permissions

[15:35:07] <vrp2zqL7> I copied it into /tmp/test for testing.

[16:10:18] <vrp2zqL7> If you are fine with the oncampus, it might be best to stick with that, then send a thank-you for consideration letter.  Once you have a decent position, potential employers like to hear that if you want to apply somewhere else later.  I am not an expert, just my two cents.

[18:16:16] <vdamewood> amigojapan: When doing credit card payments, everything is done in integer units of the smallest division of currency. It's like everyone is pretending they're Japan.
[18:16:19] <w1kl4s> i'm making a project that wants 2 db types: one for config and immutable data, speed is almost irrelevant in it, and second for high write intensity data that is also volatile - is there some all-on-one solution for that, or should i just use mariadb/postgres/whateversqllikedb + redis/memcached/whateverinmemorykeystore
[18:16:44] <amigojapan> I see vdamewood 
[18:17:05] <vdamewood> So, that book I bought recently, I bought it for 1795 cents.
[18:17:17] <Stefan26> is javascript or C your favorite programming language, vdamewood?
[18:17:26] <vdamewood> Stefan26: No.
[18:17:40] <Stefan26> mine neither, i like python the most
[18:18:08] <Stefan26> but C is coolest for maintaining the illusion I sort of understand how my code will translate to machine instructions
[18:18:23] <vdamewood> I use assembly for that effect.
[18:18:33] <amigojapan> vdamewood: I heard that in Japan for financial transactions they still use a unit smaller than one yen, called sen
[18:18:50] <vdamewood> amigojapan: I have a 50 sen note.
[18:19:10] <amigojapan> vdamewood: is it valuable?
[18:19:18] <vdamewood> It's worth about half a yen.
[18:19:29] <amigojapan> Ah ok lol
[18:19:38] <vdamewood> Seriously, I have no idea if it has collectable value.
[18:19:51] <vdamewood> But it's dated Show 17 (I think. Maybe Showa 18)

[18:20:06] <vdamewood> s/Show 17/Showa 17/
[18:20:17] <Stefan26> i worked for a large swedish bank last year... (in java, but the core bank stuff is still in COBOL)... i was surprised by how they handled currency
[18:20:54] <w1kl4s> dodo whatever is fine tbh 
[18:20:57] <Stefan26> we have "cents" in SEK (or at least used to)... but they seemed to work with the unit of 1/10th a cent ... and doing calculations on that unit (as integers)
[18:21:01] <amigojapan> vdamewood: well I don't think the notes are used anymore but in like financial programs they still keep track of sen

[18:21:50] <vdamewood> SEK = Sweet-ish Crowns?
[18:21:55] <Stefan26> yea
[18:22:02] <Rounin> Stefan26: Though who's going to complain if they're missing that little in the end
[18:22:14] <amigojapan> vdamewood: so I guess I need to have 10000sen to store 100yen so similar to what you said about cents
[18:22:43] <w1kl4s> i wanted to make entire thing in redis, but that's kinda not gonna work since dataset for non-volatile data is expected to be in gigabytes range
[18:22:51] <w1kl4s> a little bit too big for pure memory store
[18:22:54] <Stefan26> well, our side just cleaned up and extracted translactions.. didn't do the "Money-transfer/conversion" logic... so we just worked with BigDecimals with 2 decimals (cents)
[18:23:06] <vdamewood> amigojapan: I'm not sure when the Japanese covernment discontinued sen. Perhaps the computer systems are from before the conversion.
