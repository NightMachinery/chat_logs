[01:15:10] <jhutchins> Walex_: Yes.  It pops up a message that it was unable to mount the CD.
[01:15:28] <greycat> you should not attempt to mount an audio CD.  it has no file system.
[01:15:37] <jhutchins> greycat: Known.
[01:16:13] <jhutchins> It's attempting to automount it.
[01:16:31] <greycat> well then, tell it not to do that, or ignore the warning
[01:16:50] <jhutchins> I suppose what I ought to do is fire up VLC and try pointing it to the device.
[01:17:17] <jhutchins> Clumsy, but who does audio CDs these days, eh?
[01:17:49] <greycat> me, but not typically in my computer (except to rip it to files)
[01:18:42] <jhutchins> greycat: What do you use to rip it?  I haven't ripped audio in years.

[01:20:58] <nixpipe> Serious question: What's the point of the DFSG if Debian doesn't get approved as a FSF distro?
[01:21:25] <jhutchins> I guess the last thing I used was whatever KDE 3.5's music manager was.
[01:21:25] <greycat> Debian's dedication to freedom is independent of whatever the FSF thinks.
[01:21:34] <sney> debian can have its own standards and care about applying them, regardless of 3rd parties 
[01:21:46] <jhutchins> That was a great program, and I pretty much gave up on local music when they killed it.

[01:22:39] <greycat> I seem to have a talent for choosing music players that become obsolete/unsupported after I choose them.
[01:22:41] <nixpipe> Yeah but usually since debian also tries to enforce libre software in its main repos, it's only logical to connect it to the FSF
[01:23:24] <jhutchins> nixpipe: FSF is pretty fanatical.  The reason FSF doesn't approve Debian is that it CAN go beyond the FSF guidelines.  FSF approval means at the expense of reasonable functionality.

[10:19:41] <willow> is there a way to find out exactly how many CPUs a system has.  all the utilities like hwinfo and lswh list what appear to be all the cores as separate "CPUs".  not very helpful when you don't know how many cores the actual CPUs have.
[10:21:05] <willow> for example on one system 'hwinfo --cpu' lists 24 "CPUs" but I know they machine doesn't have 24 actual CPUs
[10:22:14] *** Quits: nekobyte (~nekobyte@user/nekobit) (Quit: eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee)
[10:22:59] <willow> or are the listed "CPUs" actually threads?  looking up the specs for the Xeon E5-2620 v3 in them says they have 6 cores and 12 threads
[10:23:29] <willow> so would the 24 "CPUs" listed by hwinfo mean it is a dual-CPU system?
[10:24:11] <willow> I wish there was a utility which explicitly stated the number of actual CPUs

[12:57:13] <ratrace> you have to consider that compilation workloads aren't purely CPU bound, and increasing paralelization will appear like processing much more code due to various factors.
[12:58:03] <ratrace> (ie. you'd see it increased even without HT)

[13:01:41] <ratrace> but for purely CPU bound work, like no filesystem access, no DMA transfers, in my tests ~30% was the best you could get. It is very much possible that some SIMD based workloads would show even more benefit of HT. really depends on which specific instructions, that are parallelizable by the logic core duplication, are most dominant in your workload
[13:03:01] <ratrace> but all that is moot. my gripe is with linux kernel treating them as execution cores so it's scheduling processes, what with all the context switches, nuking L1, especially now with all the meltdown and spectre mitigations and register cleanups / cache busting, on context switch.

[14:11:29] <Razva> guys I'm trying to make UFW make a simple port forwarding. Here's the log `[UFW BLOCK] IN=ens18 OUT=ens18 MAC=76:ed:83:59:3d:29:24:4b:fe:0a:16:90:08:00 SRC=82.76.118.223 DST=192.168.1.131 LEN=52 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=122 ID=35242 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=53815 DPT=65431 WINDOW=64240 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0`

[14:13:54] <ratrace> could you use paste.debian.net or some other sane paste site?
[14:15:32] <Razva> sure: https://paste.debian.net/hidden/8fdfc91a/
[14:17:39] <ratrace> you're port forwarding inside the same /24 subnet on the same NIC which also has teh srcip in teh same subnet?
[14:18:44] <Razva> yup
[14:18:58] <Razva> the Debian box is on the same class, same switch
[14:19:12] <ratrace> does that even work. how do you masquerade when srcip is in teh same subnet 
[14:19:52] <Razva> I just want to forward port 65431 to 192.168.1.31:65431, via UFW, that's all
[14:22:10] <ratrace> did you check with tcpdump to see where teh ACKs are going?

[14:22:43] <Razva> Y U block?
[14:22:51] <ratrace> because if I'm reading your paste correctly, that ain't gonna work. you're forwarding with src-ip intact so teh ACKs are going back through upstream router, supposedly, but they're not part of any established tcp session

[14:31:33] <ratrace> it's just that doing it over the same NIC might be problematic, but if you say it worked elsewhere, okay
[14:33:10] <ratrace> did a quick google on ufw specifics, seems like you additionally have to have an explicit rule allowing "any" to send packets to port 65431 on your public IP (the one facing SRC=82.76.118.223)

[14:58:38] <Lope> ratrace, you know that mongodb used to complain if it found itself on any filesystem other than XFS

[14:58:44] <Lope> I don't know if that's still the case, though.
[14:59:19] <jelly> I think we're running mongodb on like ext3
[14:59:43] <Lope> I thought of making a ghetto solution by just connecting more spare monitors to my PC, and do a squatting desk for those
[15:00:07] <Lope> then I'd put an indian wallpaper on those screens.
[15:00:27] <ratrace> Lope: well the numbers I was interested in were related to PostgreSQL. You did ask about databases... though mariadb might have a bit different access patterns.
[15:00:41] <Lope> sunk cost, when u get that sinking feeling that you've spent too much?
[15:00:42] <ratrace> for other things, xfs seems better in some tests and ext4 in others
[15:01:24] <Lope> yeah, in the stuff that I was interested in, XFS did better. It is a mixed bag I agree ext4 is competetive.

[15:03:42] <ratrace> yes the phoronix numbers showing btrfs perform better than ext4 and xfs, in some workloads, is particularly interesting. but it's not unexpected. CoW lends better to some workloads
[15:05:19] <Lope> ratrace, well, btrfs is highly configurable

[15:27:17] <ratrace> from purely data serialization aspect, yes, the attributes is where the DDL shines. and if you do it sanely, respecting RFCs, and NOT shrouding everything into damned fugging <![CDATA[]]>  because "escaping control characters is a thing, you know, so you don't need CDATA", it's very easy to work with
[15:28:12] <Lope> yeah, it's not the worst thing ever. It's stuck around forever cos it's actually good.
[15:28:21] <ratrace> sorry, we went off course and xx has a debian issue...
[15:28:28] <Lope> cool
[15:28:58] <Lope> xx, `apt update` ?
[15:29:05] <xx> that's what I ran, yes
[15:29:38] <Lope> xx, any erorrs?
[15:29:39] <xx> I have other keys in /usr/local/share/keyrings/ and they work just fine

[15:31:53] <xx> when I do `gpg --list-packets /usr/local/share/keyrings/cloudflare-warp.gpg` it correctly prints out :signature packet: algo 1, keyid 4408F627835B8ACB
[15:32:01] <xx> so it is the right key
[15:32:33] <xx> it's this key https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/pubkey.gpg
[15:32:58] <Lope> normally you'd do something like this: wget -O - https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/pubkey.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
[15:33:09] <Lope> but you might want to first download the key and inspect it or whatever
[15:33:11] <xx> yeah, but that's deprecated and advised against, isn't it?
[15:33:21] <Lope> What's deprecated?
[15:33:24] <xx> keys should not go in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg
[15:33:50] <Lope> well, you could try it just to see if that's the issue or not.
[15:34:08] <Lope> then remove the key after you confirm with `apt update`
[15:34:16] <Lope> Don't have any holy cows with computers.

[15:39:18] <Lope> how is this thing that you say is advised for 10+ years not working and the dir you refer to doesn't even exist on bullseye?
[15:39:40] <xx> keys don't belong in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg, /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/, nor /usr/share/keyrings, so that location /local/ is the preferred one
[15:39:47] <xx> the dir can be manually created if you don't ahve it
[15:39:49] <Lope> xx, it doesn't exist on buster either BTW.
[15:40:28] <Lope> xx, where is the manpage on /usr/local/share/keyrings/
[15:40:34] <Lope> do you have to enable something to make it work?
[15:40:50] <Lope> `man keyrings` has some stuff

[15:56:24] <Lope> apparently if your key starts with --- PGP YOUR MOM -- then you have to dearmor it to binary format.

[15:59:15] <xx> nevermind, I solved the issue. Clear bug in apt. I just renamed it to cloudflare-warp.key instead of cloudflare-warp.gpg
[15:59:17] <Lope> it worked!!!
[15:59:23] <Lope> xx you need to dearmor, bro
[15:59:27] <xx> I don't
[15:59:37] <Lope> Well it didn't work for me when I didn't dearmor
[15:59:49] <xx> for some reason, apt deviates from rest of linux behavior and changes behavior based on file extension
[15:59:50] <Lope> then I tried the dearmor'd file, and it worked.
[15:59:58] <xx> renaming it to .key instead of leaving it as .gpg fixed it
[16:00:08] <Lope> really.
[16:00:10] <xx> yes
[16:00:13] <Lope> So .key unarmor'd works?
[16:00:18] <Lope> lemme try
[16:00:20] <xx> I don't use unarmored keys
[16:00:42] <Lope> well the dearmor'd isn't nice to work with as a human, for sure.
[16:01:12] <Lope> xx, nice one bro!!!
[16:01:22] <Lope> thanks for teaching me some 1337 skills today
[16:01:35] <Lope> I tried to help you but helped myself in the process.
[16:01:38] <xx> hardly 1337 skills, more like uncovering bugs in apt
[16:01:44] <Lope> But at least I kind of figured out the problem.
[16:02:03] <Lope> yeah, well, nobody does this shit.
[16:02:27] <Lope> I've installed a lot of crap. Never seen this signed-by stuff.
[16:02:54] <xx> https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22usr+local+share+keyrings%22
[16:02:57] <xx> lots of people do it
[16:03:17] <Lope> yeah, but you'd think that software vendors would tell people the advisable secure way to do it
[16:03:38] <Lope> and apt-key add would show warnings
[16:03:55] <xx> `apt-key add` has been deprecated for a *long* time
[16:04:08] <Lope> it's _THE STANDARD_ though.
[16:04:16] <Lope> Like 99.9% of shit uses it.
[16:04:28] <Lope> not very well deprecated IMO.
[16:04:44] * xx shrugs
[16:04:53] <xx> it's like DEB822 style of sources
[16:04:55] <xx> nobody uses those
[16:05:11] <xx> `man sources.list`
[16:05:24] <xx> not even debian uses it
[16:05:35] <Lope> xx, the FACT that /usr/local/share/keyrings/ doesn't even exist on buster or bullseye says everything.
[16:05:46] <xx> no it doesn't
[16:05:53] <Lope> it'
[16:05:57] <xx> /usr/local/ directories are to be created by the user
[16:05:57] <Lope> it's a nothing burger.
[16:06:16] <xx> /usr/local/ is not managed by debian at all
[16:06:19] <xx> or by apt
[16:06:25] <Lope> hmm. okay
[16:06:25] <xx> that's the point of it
[16:06:30] <Lope> I see.
[16:06:42] <Lope> But I mean what about the fact that /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ exists
[16:06:48] <Lope> it's provided for you to add shit.
[16:06:56] <xx> if debian ever touches /usr/local/ then that's when I'll uninstall debian and use some other distro
[16:06:56] <Lope> to encourage best practises.
[16:07:20] <Lope> then /usr/local/share/keyrings is a pointless path.
[16:07:29] <xx> Lope: notice that that's /etc/
[16:07:33] <Lope> you might as well put it in /etc/apt/keyrings.d/
[16:07:35] <xx> user is expected to change /etc/
[16:07:44] <xx> keyrings are not configs though
[16:07:48] <xx> so they don't belong in /etc/
[16:08:11] <Lope> surely it's most convenient to store the source definition with the key?
[16:08:29] <PMT> it's convenient to do everything as root too, doesn't mean you should
[16:13:25] <wintersky> my souvenirs are here \o/ https://ibb.co/c6mcJ33
[16:14:52] <xx> Lope: it really isn't because if you install keyrings through a package manager, then they will go to /usr/share/keyrings/
[16:15:06] <xx> meaning that if you add them manually, then they should go in /usr/local/share/keyrings/
[16:15:35] <Lope> xx, okay, the only benefit is if you're working on a system with other admins then. Cos it's not going to be used by any software automatically.
[16:15:46] <Lope> Not saying it shouldn't be done. Just saying.
[16:16:02] <xx> the signed-by= field should be used by everyone, otherwise any key can sign any repo

[16:17:46] <xx> so let's say if whoever signs mongodb gets access to any of the debian mirrors, then they can just replace any of the file on the mirror and debian will happily install it
[16:18:07] <xx> whereas if you do it properly, then debian would no longer accept that mirror
[16:18:32] <xx> and there are a lot of mirrors, on university networks, where they are poorly secured
[16:18:50] <xx> but it doesn't matter as long as your debian is properly configured
[16:19:07] <PMT> Of course, if you have access to the mongodb mirror and wanted to attack people who have it added, you could just provide a malicious package with a higher version to ensure it gets installed...
[16:19:23] <xx> not if you use a .pref file
[16:19:33] <xx> and pin it to a lower number than debian mirrors

[16:21:06] <xx> well most people do it wrong

[16:22:22] * xx shrugs
[16:22:26] <xx> that's debian
[16:22:32] <Lope> lax on security
[16:22:47] <xx> people add things to /etc/apt/sources.list anyway instead of using that dir
[16:22:59] <Lope> xx, not anymore much

[17:40:15] <PMT> The example in 815828 explicitly includes a separate main/debian-installer reference.

[17:45:10] <jelly> yeah, you shot yourself in the foot by doing an explicit --section.   The code says...

[20:53:37] <DHE> is there something I can specify on the installer boot commandline (or other means) to select a mirror to use for installation? goal is a netboot install with no internet access whatsoever. the pxeboot part is easy, just need to to set it up
[20:54:09] <sney> !preseed
[20:54:09] <dpkg> [preseed] Preseeding provides a way to set answers to questions asked during the Debian installation process, to allow for a streamlined or completely automated installation.  The <install guide> provides an extensive appendix on preseeding with a full example.  See http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed and http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/394 .  See also <debconf-set-selections>.
[20:54:46] <shtrb> DHE, you can select default and post the installation modify to any other mirror (as long you have access to the machine)

[22:47:39] <funnybunny> Hi, I'm trying to test some C code on a big-endian system. I tried an old sparc image and also a mips image which I found here with QEMU: https://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/mips/ Both didn't contain a C compiler. Can anyone help me run a big-endian system with QEMU that has a C compiler?
[22:48:58] <PMT> Why not just install an image yourself? The old install media are still available.
[22:49:55] <PMT> ppc64 was pretty straightforward when I did it.
[22:50:17] <funnybunny> I followed this guide to install an old sparc image https://www.aurel32.net/info/debian_sparc_qemu.php It worked, but there was no C compiler. I downloaded newer sparc and mips images, but I haven't figured out the correct QEMU command for booting them
[22:50:38] <funnybunny> Is ppc64 big-endian?
[22:51:11] <PMT> Given the BE issues I was debugging and the presence of the ppc64le arch, I would suspect so.

[23:09:07] <funnybunny> But then I get a weird error...
[23:09:08] <PMT> -drive is the more generalized syntax, I suspect -hda etc wrap to some incantation.
[23:09:14] <PMT> ppc64el won't do what you want
[23:09:35] <PMT> if you want to play with big endian
[23:09:44] <funnybunny> Oh?
[23:10:14] <PMT> I could be misunderstanding what it is. It wouldn't be the first time.
[23:10:22] <funnybunny> What should I be getting? https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/
[23:10:53] <funnybunny> I got PPC because you said you were using it. I guess I misunderstood
[23:11:00] *** Quits: darutoko (~darutoko@92.125.62.210) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:12:24] <funnybunny> I tried the command you posted but I got qemu-system-ppc64: Unsupported NIC model: virtio-net-pci
[23:12:34] <PMT> Depending on precisely the properties you wanted, https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/snapshots/2021-06-09/debian-10.0.0-ppc64-NETINST-1.iso was the kind of suggestion I was making.
[23:12:35] <funnybunny> After removing that I got qemu-system-ppc64: No Transactional Memory support in TCG, try cap-htm=off
[23:13:15] <funnybunny> OK ty
[23:13:18] <funnybunny> Will try that now
[23:13:29] <funnybunny> I just want a C compiler and big-endian system
[23:15:05] <PMT> Yeah, I get that. I suggested ppc64 because I found it reasonably speedy compared to mips64 or sparc64, though still slower than I'd love.
[23:15:41] <funnybunny> I keep getting qemu-system-ppc64: No Transactional Memory support in TCG, try cap-htm=off and then qemu-system-ppc64: -boot d: drive with bus=0, unit=0 (index=0) exists when I add cap-htm=off
[23:16:29] <PMT> I think you're passing it wrong.
[23:17:02] <PMT> I am aware it did not specify precisely how.
[23:17:09] <funnybunny> Yeah
[23:17:33] <funnybunny> Oh, I see
[23:17:43] <funnybunny> -machine cap-htm=off
[23:18:11] <funnybunny> BOOM
[23:18:17] <funnybunny> Totally black screen
[23:18:22] <funnybunny> Oh wait GRUB!
[23:19:08] <PMT> Yes, emulation is slow. One benefit of using ppc64 is you should be able to specify -smp N to have N virtual cores.

[23:19:27] <funnybunny> Oh, maybe I should reboot then
[23:19:35] <funnybunny> Let's try...
[23:19:58] <funnybunny> Hm... didn't seem to run much faster
[23:20:24] <PMT> Boot wouldn't be particularly faster, no; it might even be slower. It's when you get to the parts where multiple things are going that it might improve.
[23:21:00] <funnybunny> I think I should increase the memory too
[23:21:04] <funnybunny> Like your cmd
[23:21:22] <PMT> I would imagine. I actually have no idea what the default is.
[23:21:31] <funnybunny> What is -M mac99?
[23:21:39] <funnybunny> And -L pc-bios
[23:21:39] <PMT> -M == -machine
[23:22:05] <funnybunny> Oh
[23:22:30] <funnybunny> nvm that was from something online
[23:23:01] <PMT> -L specifies the directory to look for the BIOS stuff in, I think. As you can see from my command, I do not use it here.
[23:23:57] <funnybunny> What is -net user?
[23:24:55] <PMT>               Configure a host network backend (with the options corresponding to the same -netdev option) and connect it to the emulated hub 0 (the default hub). Use name to specify the name of the hub port.
[23:25:34] <funnybunny> I tried -nographic and it totally locked up
[23:25:51] <funnybunny> Stuck on Trying to load:  from: /vdevice/v-scsi@71000003/disk@8200000000000000 ...   Successfully loaded
[23:26:32] <PMT> If it's locking up for you when you changed something, then change it back.
[23:26:51] <funnybunny> Yeah I'm doing qemu-system-ppc64 -drive file=hda.img -machine cap-htm=off -smp 8 -m 2048 -net user -cdrom debian-10.0.0-ppc64-NETINST-1.iso -boot once=d

[23:28:09] <PMT> you seem to have dropped things that you will regret dropping
[23:28:42] <PMT> you may also wish to try fewer cores, sometimes some architectures don't boot well with higher core counts
[23:28:58] <funnybunny> Oh, I see I'm missing -net nic,model=virtio-net-pci I don
[23:29:13] <funnybunny> I dropped virtio-net-pci because it didn't work
[23:29:49] <PMT> That's interesting, it didn't complain for me.
[23:30:15] <PMT> but then, I'm running newer qemu than you.
[23:32:03] <funnybunny> Wow, this Fabrice guy also wrote FFMPEG
[23:32:09] <funnybunny> What a boss
[23:32:11] <PMT> Fabrice Bellard is remarkable.
[23:32:50] <funnybunny> I think I remember playing on this guy's website before
[23:33:00] <funnybunny> I played solitate on a Javscript-emulated windows machine
