[01:28:16] <rpifan> and i had an interview with the consulting firm

[01:28:45] <rpifan> they thought azuread was like normal AD
[01:28:50] <rpifan> so the agent came from them

[07:16:37] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Some fly species‚Äîincluding bee flies, hoverflies, and midges‚Äîserve as pollinators for a variety of plants that are not attractive to bees. In fact, you can thank midges for satisfying your chocolate craving. These tiny flies are the primary pollinators of the cacao (or cocoa) tree.
[07:16:45] <NoxTurminal> So like this TS farm has every version of QuickBooks for instance installed since 2013

[13:21:43] <Kiernian|Work> hey cl0udNinja a fully operational 1950? 1U? what do those weigh, 40 pounds?
[13:22:07] <Cl0udNinja> probably less. yeah its operational
[13:22:24] <Cl0udNinja> I gotta double check its a 1950 but I'm pretty sure it is
[13:22:39] <Kiernian|Work> I wonder what it costs to ship one of those. Probably more than it's worth at any appreciable distance
[13:25:35] <Oliber> you can get one with a pair of Xeon 5160s, 16Gb ram and no storage or rails for ¬£130
[13:25:55] <Reinhilde> i ended up buying an eighty dolan listing for a pair of E5 2640v3

[13:40:16] <Cl0udNinja> Kiernian|Work, actually, technically not *that* bad unless you'd want it like super fast..
[13:40:32] <Cl0udNinja> ~$30 for ~1 week arrival
[13:41:06] <Kiernian|Work> oh, that's not bad at all. does it have storage in it? I'd have to get approval, but I might actually use that.
[13:41:14] <Cl0udNinja> $50 at the high end for 1 week
[13:41:33] <Kiernian|Work> I'm limping along an old setup that was supposed to be decomissioned last year...I've probably got another year to limp it all
[13:41:33] <Cl0udNinja> uhm.. not sure.. I think it does, but its not a lot
[13:50:40] <Cl0udNinja> Kiernian|Work, its got 2 250 7.2k rusties
[13:50:52] <Kiernian|Work> that'd be more than enough
[13:55:38] <Cl0udNinja> checkin ebay looks like mostly goin for ~150 +/- 50 so... if you want it, we can discuss more. make me an offer and then we can talk shipping

[18:33:48] <PrincessZoey> on campus 5 days a week and in office 3 days a week. I'm gunna catch this virus yet
[18:34:25] <sintax> PrincessZoey: i social distance with the best of them. caught it in the office from a vaccinated person :/ whomp whomp. But she's still home quarantining. I was lucky and it was super mild. 
[18:34:29] <Kiernian> I went and visited my parents over the holiday and amongst your typical vulnerable old people ads on whatever channel they were watching was one for a new company doing striking new things with office real estate
[18:34:33] <Kiernian> and looking for investors
[18:34:36] <Kiernian> get in on the ground floor
[18:34:48] <sintax> heh

[18:35:41] <Kiernian> I was like "holy predatory bullshit". They didn't say, but it looked like they were just selling corporate real estate that got yanked up after covid foreclosures. Not sure who they'd sell it to, though.

[18:39:44] <PublicWiFi> how do I know it was powershell? cause my logs fucking went wild the first time someone used it lol
[18:40:10] <Kiernian> yeah, great stuff. we coded it up so that since servicenow detected a user's AD credentials and logged them in as themselves, the script pulled that and allowed for self-service end user session reset

[18:47:08] <JollyRgrs> i've only either seen "barely keep the skeleton of ITIL" or "ITIL SO HARD YOU CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE"
[18:47:38] <Kiernian> all changes SHOULD be approved by CAB. CAB just needs to understand that the whole point it exists is TO APPROVE CHANGES THAT FOLLOW PROPER CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES
[18:47:45] <signofzeta> Oh joy, we added the bad Windows 10 update to our blocklist.  I removed from some guy's computer yesterday.  It's back today, somehow.  Escalation!
[18:47:53] <sd> 13<C‚Äãolour> I hate the idea of CABs. Until recently it was like: Ok if we want to update and reboot this server we need a CAB meeting with their team and then they'll probably say no.

[18:47:58] <sd> 13<C‚Äãolour> I haven't seen the benefit of CABs yet

[18:48:58] <Kiernian> Colour -- that should be part of a weekly scheduled change. They ask you in the meeting if there's anything noteworthy about this set of updates and reboots, you say no, they ask if your rollback plan is still feasible, you say yes, then you update and reboot at the scheduled time
[18:49:01] <JollyRgrs> I've seen many STUPID Changes stopped b/c someone asked "well, have you thought about this? or how would you back out if things went wrong?" and they had dead air for answers

[23:00:58] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> I'll leave that to my first hire, lol
[23:03:09] <signofzeta> Yes, I set up a root-intermediate CA system.  Just remember to boot the root and generate new CRLs more often than "never" or else your clients will start failing.
[23:03:24] <signofzeta> then I set CRL length to a year, since the root was quite idle
[23:04:00] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> crl = cert revokation list?
[23:04:33] <signofzeta> yes.  see also: OCSP
[23:05:08] <signofzeta> if Windows can't fetch a CRL before it expires, it'll invalidate the chain.  My root CRL was no longer fresh, and the intermediate's issued certs started saying "nope" (at least for the Windows VPN service)
[23:09:34] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> That's a very good explanation, thanks. I didn't realize that about what happens before it expires
[23:10:26] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> So you can set that expiration period (you set it to a year) and then if you booted up the Root CA once every 9 months to update and let the intermediate CAs phone home you'd be good?

[23:12:10] <signofzeta> @Killnine: Yes, that's what I wound up doing.  I'd do it around the 3-6 month mark because I would forget otherwise.

[23:15:44] <signofzeta> For an offline root CA, there was no virtual NIC.  I'd boot it, make a CRL, shut it down, then grab them off the VHD file.
