[02:56:30] <skrzyp> the funny problem on top is that I actually started to somewhat prototyping the application which will be used in such legacy environments in... Go, as I was almost 100% sure it supports XP since I used it a few years ago to build a simple tool on XP Embedded which interacts with GRUB2 bootloader config/environment
[02:56:45] <skrzyp> but looks like Go dropped XP pretty recently
[02:56:56] <leonardo> i suppose programming languages/libraries/interprers constantly evolving prefers not to struggle with abandoned software
[02:57:21] <leonardo> and IMO is kind of a sane choice
[02:57:23] <skrzyp> of course, so that's why I'm digging in niche or specialized stuff right now
[02:58:19] <skrzyp> and, on the other hand, I don't really think that Windows internally does really need too much changes for language developers to implement between Windows versions if we stick to NT kernel, but I might be wrong
[03:01:00] <leonardo> i believe programming languages in windows just target win32 API instead of directly work with the NT kernel? not sure tho
[03:05:19] <skrzyp> But win32 isn't changing that much right now afaik, they're focusing on .net/uwp/whatever or even web stuff today

[18:59:25] <kline> few to no countries have actual emoji
[19:00:08] <kline> unicode has combining chars for this that can be used in an infinite number of ways, and its on vendors to add custom images for combinations they want to support
[19:00:58] <kline> so the combination of REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER G and REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER B, ie GB, often maps to the UK (great britain) flag
[19:01:37] <kline> why? it neatly sidesteps unicode having to make political pronouncements on what a country is. theres no pressure to accept/deny any unicode codepoint for palestine, for example
