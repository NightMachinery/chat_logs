[14:02:43] <m1dnight> Hi all. I'm looking for a verb to say "has become close by". I currently have the following sentence: "It emits a value when a device joins, leaves, is nearby, or is far away.
[14:02:46] <m1dnight> "
[14:02:52] <m1dnight> I think the "is near by, or is far away" is odd, no?
[14:03:26] <m1dnight> "joins" and "leaves" imply that that state just happened. "is nearby" does not imply that it was not nearby before.
