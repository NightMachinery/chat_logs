[13:38:27] <clason[m]> something might already be broken
[13:38:31] <clason[m]> then don't use master!
[13:38:41] <clason[m]> (seriously.)
[13:39:31] <ii14[m]> I'm okay with using master, I just don't have time right now to do deal with potential breaking changes
[13:39:58] <clason[m]> not telling you how to live your life, but that's a contradiction. 
[13:40:18] <clason[m]> and unsupported 
[13:40:23] <ii14[m]> I don't see how

[13:40:35] <ii14[m]> I update, test it a bit if everything works, if not then revert the update
[13:41:00] <clason[m]> sure, but you need to do that (somewhat) frequently
[13:41:27] <ii14[m]> why?
[13:41:33] <ii14[m]> if it works, it works
[13:41:35] <clason[m]> as most everything (including plugins) assumes that if you're on 0.6 (which is master right now), you're on the tip of master
[13:41:40] <clason[m]> well, until it doesn't
[13:41:49] <ii14[m]> I don't update plugins that often
[13:42:12] <ii14[m]> only when I know I'm up to date with neovim
[13:43:49] <clason[m]> sure, if you freeze the whole stack
[13:44:19] <clason[m]> just saying there's no support then
[13:47:08] <clason[m]> <ii14[m]> "I always remember it being..." <- No, you're right, I was misremembering. That was why the colored blocks are the way they are.
[13:51:37] <ii14[m]> you think it'd be a good idea to change it or at least have the option to do so?
[13:51:49] <ii14[m]> I could do it
[13:51:58] <ii14[m]> later today
[13:52:52] <clason[m]> I don't know. That would break the connection with the boxes.
[13:53:16] <ii14[m]> the boxes?
[13:53:28] <clason[m]> yes, the colored boxes before the text
[13:53:30] <ii14[m]> those blocks in virttext?
[13:53:35] <ii14[m]> ok
[13:53:42] <clason[m]> they indicate the number, order, and severity of the diagnostics
[13:54:51] <clason[m]> anyway, best ask on dev chat later today (when the two diagnostics devs are awake)
[13:54:54] <ii14[m]> so maybe their order should always stay the same
[13:55:09] <ii14[m]> only the text can change
[13:55:23] <ii14[m]> and the signs
[13:55:51] <ii14[m]> you mean neovim chat, or is there another one
[13:55:54] <clason[m]> Not sure. The current way has a cohesiveness to it that would be lost
[13:55:57] <clason[m]> sure, yes

[16:30:35] <mjlbach[m]> <hendry> "i'm using lsp+gopls well, but i..." <- I’m not sure that’s a feature offered by gopls
[16:31:18] <mjlbach[m]> <ii14[m]> "so maybe their order should..." <- What is it you’re looking for? We can do severity sort but it’s off by default as it adds overhead and removes server control of the diagnostic order 
[16:31:52] <mjlbach[m]> 🏳️‍⚧️ nullrequest(she/her): do you have syntax on/enable in your config?
[16:37:01] <ii14[m]> mjlbach signs and virttext shows the last error, and usually it's the first one you care most about
[16:37:27] <mjlbach[m]> Right but we have an option to sort them
[16:38:14] <clason[m]> I don't think that helps here: no matter how the dkag l
[16:38:22] <ii14[m]> I guess that works too, but it would be nice just to reverse the order
[16:38:30] <ii14[m]> or not really reverse the order
[16:38:34] <ii14[m]> just show the first error
[16:38:59] <mjlbach[m]> You mean in the floating window?
[16:39:07] <clason[m]> s/dkag/diagnostics/, s/l/are sorted, the `show()` method only shows the virtual text for the _last_ diagnostic on a line, not the first/
[16:39:10] <ii14[m]> <mjlbach[m]> "I’m not sure that’s a feature..." <- gopls has autoimports
[16:39:15] <mjlbach[m]> Only show a single error regardless?
[16:39:16] <ii14[m]> no, I mean virttext and signs

[16:39:43] <clason[m]> the `show()` method loops over all diagnostics, so the later ones overwrite the earlier ones
[16:39:49] <ii14[m]> IMO it the virttext should show the first error
[16:39:56] <ii14[m]> s/it//
[16:40:09] <mjlbach[m]> Is it showing multiple errors?
[16:40:20] <ii14[m]> yeah, but I'm talking about virttext
[16:40:21] <clason[m]> one error, one hint
[16:40:34] <ii14[m]> not floating window
[16:40:37] <mjlbach[m]> I’m talking about virtual text
[16:41:27] <ii14[m]> I'm not sure, maybe it shows multiple errors, but it doesn't fit on the screen anyway
[16:41:31] <mjlbach[m]> If you enable severity sort virtual text should show only the most severe error
[16:42:23] <ii14[m]> I know, I'm just saying that usually you care about the first error the most
[16:42:25] <ii14[m]> not the last one
[16:42:40] <clason[m]> mjlbach[m]: Are you sure about that?
[16:43:10] <ii14[m]> this is true for every language server I tried so far
[16:43:35] <mjlbach[m]> I don’t understand what you mean by the “first” error
[16:43:57] <clason[m]> look at either the boxes for the virt_text or the float
[16:44:03] <ii14[m]> see the floating window, there is 1. error, 2. some warning
[16:44:17] <ii14[m]> 1. is the first error
[16:44:34] <ii14[m]> I mean the first diagnostic
[16:44:46] <mjlbach[m]> Ahhh now I understand what you mean
[16:45:15] <mjlbach[m]> We should have an option for reversing the ordering for virtual text
[16:46:03] <mjlbach[m]> But maybe we should show by default the first entry in the per line cache
[16:46:28] <clason[m]> I think it's enough to flip the for loop in the virt_text and signs handler
[16:46:31] <mjlbach[m]> (And only the single entry)
[16:46:33] <clason[m]> draw from last to first
[16:46:42] <ii14[m]> so probably `reverse` should be moved out of `severity_sort`
[16:46:49] <clason[m]> so that the first entry on a line overwrites the others, instead of the last
[16:46:58] <ii14[m]> in diagnostic.config
[16:47:12] <mjlbach[m]> I don’t think we should overwrite virtual text with other virtual text
[16:47:25] <mjlbach[m]> That seems like a waste (if that is what we are doing)
[16:47:36] <clason[m]> that is what we are doing

[17:42:26] <gpanders> ii14 virt text and signs should be respecting severity sort such that the highest severity diagnostic is the one shown. If that’s not the case it’s a regression
[17:42:50] <clason[m]> Sorry, that's not quite the point here
[17:42:52] <ii14[m]> they are, that's not really the issue I have
[17:43:04] <ii14[m]> it's that when they're not sorted by severity
[17:43:08] <ii14[m]> it's reversed
[17:43:11] <gpanders> Oh ok sorry, I misread the convo then
[17:43:25] <ii14[m]> what I mean is that it prefers last diagnostic
[17:43:31] <clason[m]> (even when they're sorted, you see the virt_text and sign for the last diagnostic on the list, not the first)
[17:43:36] <ii14[m]> instead of the first, which is usually the most important
[17:43:51] <ii14[m]> but sorting by severity sort of fixes that
