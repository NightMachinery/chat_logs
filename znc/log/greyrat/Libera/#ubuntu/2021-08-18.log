[01:57:33] <ubottu> There's a flaw in the BFD library of binutils in versions before 2.36. An attacker who supplies a crafted file to an application linked with BFD, and using the DWARF functionality, could cause an impact to system availability by way of excessive memory consumption. <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3487>

[02:01:13] <tomreyn> xMopx: i was previously told about its exitence
[02:01:20] <TJ-> ens: so, either the timeout is too low, ir the device isn't ready at this point (maybe due to the iwlwifi device not having set things up on the USB interface fully at that point)
[02:01:23] <xMopx> hah, alright
[02:02:53] <TJ-> ens: so I think the solution is to delay loading of the btusb module for a second or two
[02:03:09] <ens> TJ-: so the device is reporting it's ready for the next bit of processing when it's not. i see.
[02:03:18] <ens> and then the code tries to load the firmware and gets this issue

[05:58:22] <tomreyn> hirsute (Ubuntu 21.04) comes with kernel version 5.11
[06:00:48] <tomreyn> generally speaking, if you have hardware functionality you strictly depend on, and which is too new to be supported on any ubuntu release but supported by newer kernel versions, then you could use a script to keep running the latest mainline kernels until there is support for it in ubuntu.

[09:02:42] <blahboybaz> Can not remove a printer in 20.04. It keeps automatically adding back as soon as I remove it. I've tried looking for information online but what I'm finding looks like a bunch of long-winded jibberish! Is there a simple solution that allows me to get rid of this offending printer that I don't even own?

[09:20:50] <blahboybaz> So am I forced to have some printer on my machine? What happens if I uninstall cups? Probably a bunch of other stuff is dependend on it and the system breaks? Or if I get a printer later that I want to use I can't because I don't have cups on my machine? If I reinstall it to use my own printer later then it just installs that strangers printer again like - ha ha! gotcha again! right?

[18:50:52] <marcoagpinto> Hello!
[18:51:03] <tomreyn> pizzaburger: i think i brought up btrfs here, mixing this up with a chat i had in #ubuntu-server. what you have there is probably zfs, not btrfs
[18:51:04] <marcoagpinto> why has my VM installed hours ago crashed?

[18:52:38] <marcoagpinto> it crashed while I was browsing with Firefox

My need is the reverse: I have a build environment (not part of ubuntu distribution) expecting to run under Ubuntu 16.04. It generally works also with current (20.04), but in certain instances fails (e.g.: while compiling some selinux packages).
[22:12:51] <mcon> Current "solution" is to run in a VirtualBox VM, but that is very heavy.
[22:14:20] <mcon> I seem to recall there's some Hypervisor expecially tuned to run older Ubuntu releases and that Ubuntu maintains a series of "ready-to-use images. Did I dream?

While it defaults to the 'full mirror' approach you discussed, later versions can

[23:05:13] <tomreyn> carnophage2: is there a ~/.config/autostart/*exchat*.desktop  file?
[23:06:49] <tomreyn> carnophage2: the easiest approach for configurring applications you want to autostart is to install GNOME Tweaks ("Tweaks"), run it, go to "Startup Applications" and select the application you want to start.

[23:36:08] <hajonnes> tomreyn, it is packed in ubuntu. but since it is US keyboard with altGr to make special characters I tried to find it under US. Do you know where it is stored, I tried to search for euskara but could not find anything.

[23:52:14] <hajonnes> tomreyn, I'm not sure, "setxkbmap eu" results in the eurkey keyboard layout. So it must exist in some package. it also says on the homepage that it is included in xkeyboard-config 2.12 and newer. But I do not know more than that.
