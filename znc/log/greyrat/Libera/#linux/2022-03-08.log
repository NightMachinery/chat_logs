[01:35:08] <phogg> it's just a popular combination

[01:39:11] <Gustavo6046> isn't Sway just wayland i3?
[01:39:14] <phogg> Gustavo6046: most WMs aren't as extensible as kwin, so elsewhere you may or may not have the same kind of option. It's still worth looking in to if you're interested. And there's no reason you can't run xfce with kwin
[01:39:15] <Gustavo6046> and i3 is minimal and keyboard heavy

[01:39:47] <Mister_Magister> Mathisen: okay thanks non the less
[01:39:56] <duuude> it makes sense for editors to be keyboard heavy
[01:40:00] <Gustavo6046> duuude, but UI navigation doesn't have to be
[01:40:06] <Gustavo6046> it's more efficient yes

[01:40:16] <hexnewbie> Gustavo6046: Featureless, less. Buggy? The behaviour I am sure is deliberate
[01:40:24] <phogg> GNOME does appear to have something along those lines https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3733/tiling-assistant/ -- acts like the Windows WM in terms of snap-to-tile behavior

[02:07:51] <ananke> that question does not compute
[02:08:19] <ananke> how many disks are there total? two?
[02:08:29] <twiclo> I have a dell server with a hardware raid controller with no HBA mode. You HAVE to set a disk up as a virtual disk if you want the OS to see it
[02:08:44] <twiclo> There are 4 disks. Each one is their own raid0. I know zfs really hates raids
[02:08:59] <twiclo> And in this configuration zfs practically can't see anything about the disks
[02:09:20] *** Joins: cesdo (uid516690@id-516690.tinside.irccloud.com)
[02:09:29] <ananke> many of those lower end PERCs simply allow you to expose the disks directly, without having to resort to such hacks as 'setting up individual arrays for each disk'
[02:09:44] <twiclo> These two servers I have do not allow that
[02:09:52] <ananke> which PERC models?
[02:09:59] <twiclo> PERC H710
[02:10:14] <twiclo> We've been working on this for a while at work now. Trust me they don't have the option
[02:10:34] <twiclo> So what would happen? Seems like nothing bad really but it kinda defeats the point of zfs
[02:10:56] <RayTracer> twiclo: I guess there is no point in counting that as "raid" for zfs, if it only serves to deliver a single disk

[02:28:41] <taperipper> Hey, I got a second lto4 drive some tapes off ebay years ago; I never got around to setting it up properly. I've just been playing with xfsdump and had two of the second hand tapes rip on insert, leaving the leader pin stuck in the drive. I don't know the usage/storage history of the tapes so I'm not going to rely on them. Any warranty is void (the
[02:28:42] <taperipper> drive has been opened) and servicing is likely more trouble than it's worth. Is it worth buying new tapes or is it possible the drive is just borked and it'll destroy them too?

[04:50:33] <tirnanog> rascul: perhaps the context was that of filesystems. but if you just write directly to a block device and you're not using ODIRECT, disk-backed pages are marked as dirty, if they were already present, or are written to pagecache as dirty pages. using pagecache as a writeback cache, effectively. the kernel then writes them back to storage whenever it feels like it.
[04:50:34] *** Joins: CombatVet (~c4@user/combatvet)
[04:51:06] <tirnanog> but ejecting removable media should block on flushing all dirty pages associated with the backing device before it gives the all clear.

[05:20:41] <ayecee> that's a difficult metaphor to unpack

[05:21:21] <rascul> but don't take my word for that
[05:21:23] <Gustavo6046> rascul, yes, I think the best contender is zstd
[05:22:00] <rascul> i've not looked too much into zstd, it looks interesting but i don't think it's nearly as widely available as gzip, if that's a factor for you
[05:22:21] <Gustavo6046> it's not but it's easily installable
[05:22:37] <ayecee> i don't know if there's a sourcecode specific algorithm, but algorithms that can take a prepopulated dictionary could help.

[07:01:05] <gog> did somebody say bagel
[07:01:10] <kfrench> sudomann: Legally, you can probably do it as long as there is no conflict of interest.  If you tell both companies you can do it for a couple of years, they still might hesitate.  You'll have to change something in a couple of years and I doubt they'll want you to abandon them.
[07:01:26] <tusko> help me find a program that can read to me

[07:01:43] <wyclif> sudomann: Doesn't it depend if the companies in question make their employment info available to the public?
[07:01:44] <kfrench> Your work schedule at both places could become a big problem as people at one company have to adjust to the people at the other company.
[07:01:55] <tangy> anyone can call to check a work reference, of course

[07:02:43] <wyclif> Wouldn't hurt to find out for sure
[07:03:07] <wyclif> That depends as well...do they have IP rights or not?
[07:03:11] <sudomann> Luckily I have on average 5 meetings a week at my current company, so I dont imagine I'll run into too many scheduling conflicts.

[20:27:11] <ne2k> mad_moses, https://www.mersenne.org/download/#download you can compile from source if you have a compiler available. otherwise there are binaries. it doesn't mention dependencies so I guess they're probably statically linked

[20:27:38] <mad_moses> Dagmar: yes, but just want to get an idea
[20:27:41] <Dagmar> You can definitely tell ffmpeg what type of video to _expect_ from the source, but it generally figures that out just fine.  I don't know about it's ability to actually _configure_ devices to send that

[23:50:29] <vdamewood> Moainging?! Where? Don't let it get me.
[23:50:30] <BSaboia> I think that this error is misleading. I had to run curl verbosely to realize that the error was with 0x0.st, and that was the actual return of the POST request
[23:50:36] <vdamewood> Morning*
