[10:58:24] <MatthiasVance> I am here to confess
[10:58:29] <MatthiasVance> I didn't do much F# lately
[10:58:40] <MatthiasVance> Wow, that's a lie!
[10:58:59] <MatthiasVance> I haven't been doing my Bolero/Elmish project lately but still my job is all F# :D
[10:59:10] <MatthiasVance> And it feels so different from a year ago, so much more fluency
[11:00:14] <MatthiasVance> Anyone else doing some fun (ðŸ˜‚) F#?
[11:28:38] <biberu> it's been a couple of weeks
[11:29:13] <biberu> i did have some success with the last tool that would've been suited for f#, but that i wrote in c# to make others curious though
[12:06:25] <MatthiasVance> Ah right, a more functional C# approach, right?
[12:16:02] <biberu> yeah
[12:19:43] <biberu> MatthiasVance: there was e.g. one step that sequenced some tasks, seq<task<t>> -> task<seq<t>>, with a single line of code in the middle of the pipeline that resolved the whole thing in parallel, that got some oohs
[12:21:47] <biberu> MatthiasVance: then the usual easy to read error handling etc, and practically no visible async/await in higher level code :)
[12:28:17] <MatthiasVance> :D
[12:40:25] <akronymus[m]> MatthiasVance: sadly I don't really get to do any f#
[13:21:52] <xeno> akronymus[m]: I don't think almost anyone get to do any F# for money 
[13:23:03] <akronymus[m]> xeno at least most don't need to use progress/openedge/abl at work.
[13:27:55] <biberu> xeno: there are several companies around here that use it
[13:34:04] <MatthiasVance> Same here
[13:34:07] <MatthiasVance> Well, here is not NL
[13:34:08] <MatthiasVance> NL sucks!
[13:34:25] <MatthiasVance> Adyen CEO complaining about software engineer wages seems ot be typical NL thinking
[13:44:48] <xeno> but is it enough that it can't easily be rounded down to 0? 
[13:47:13] <MatthiasVance> xeno: What?
[13:48:57] <xeno> I mean, if you have 3.100.000 positions in the country, and 14 of them are for using F#, then it's ~0
[13:49:35] <MatthiasVance> ahh
[13:51:12] <biberu> but 3.1 < 14
[13:51:18] <biberu> this seems good
[14:00:29] <xeno> then there's some positions that requires compartmentalization where multiple instances uses F#
[14:05:17] <biberu> xeno: i was about to apply for an f# position before i got my new job
[14:05:33] <xeno> nice, what kinda company was it? 
[14:05:37] <biberu> but yes, they are few, wouldn't count on spending my career doing only that
[14:05:50] <biberu> a bank in stockholm
[14:09:11] <akronymus[m]> Finance uses f# quite a bit, afaik.
[14:13:03] <jinsun> there are some teams in my company that use F#, unfortunately not mine, its python land here
[14:14:58] <jinsun> I wrote some hacky and simple F# few times when I had to use some old library from the other team, and they hadn't made python bindings for it yet, but that didn't last long
[14:16:19] <akronymus[m]> jinsun have you heard of banking python?
[14:16:30] <akronymus[m]> https://calpaterson.com/bank-python.html
[14:20:30] <jinsun> :D I'm at a bank, so yeah seen stuff like that
[14:21:04] <akronymus[m]> I am such an idiot...
[14:21:57] <jinsun> why?
[14:22:53] <akronymus[m]> https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/fixenufaci.csharp I can just run async and use async.sleep to run my event loop
[14:23:09] <akronymus[m]> (elmish)
[14:23:41] <jinsun> though it is not as bad, python is just there to connect with http services that do most of the work, which are mostly in C++ and F#
[15:01:07] <xeno> akronymus[m]: to be quite honest, I would not be comfortable being a customer of a bank that has implemented their solutions in python
[15:01:26] <akronymus[m]> Allegedly it is a big bank.
[15:06:53] <akronymus[m]> I got it to work.
[15:07:00] <akronymus[m]> Altough, it still requires user interaction :(
[15:07:12] <akronymus[m]> https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/umafilopof.rust
[15:07:37] <akronymus[m]> And I am not happy with the code at all.
[15:30:47] <akronymus[m]> Huh, has anyone of you heard of the "earn it" act?
[15:31:28] <akronymus[m]> That seems to likely make it that the US and EU internet will be split.
[15:31:33] <akronymus[m]> At least to me.
[17:29:21] <biberu> isn't it already?
[17:29:46] <biberu> visit american site -> we're not allowed to track you, go away
[17:33:08] <MatthiasVance> "Oh .rust, let's check it out..."
[18:09:18] <akronymus[m]> Well, hastebin chooses whatever language it thinks is right.
[18:10:11] <akronymus[m]> Sadly, it seems to lack fsharp.
[18:10:37] <biberu> isn't it random?
[18:10:48] <akronymus[m]> Nvm, it actually has it
[18:11:29] <biberu> at least i've always considered it some sort of flair, not any indication of what it contains
[18:11:53] <biberu> but what did they do to the url?
[18:12:21] <biberu> lets make it looooooooooong
[18:13:25] <biberu> akronymus[m]: it doesn't even show the paste for me, since my browser blocks some of those scripts by default
[18:13:58] <akronymus[m]> It does some syntax highlighting
[18:14:14] <akronymus[m]> And someone seems to have bought the original hastebin.
[18:14:36] <akronymus[m]> https://github.com/toptal/haste-server/issues/396
[18:25:08] <MatthiasVance> Wow that is so bad
[18:34:00] <biberu> woo, new books arrived \o/
[21:01:02] <MatthiasVance> What books are you going to read biberu? And why physical books?
[21:41:56] <biberu> MatthiasVance: i just prefer to read like that, but I'll often read the same book in print and on an ereader at the same time
[21:44:28] <biberu> MatthiasVance: this batch is software engineering at google, designing data intensive applications, large scale c++, and a collection of papers by parnas, should keep me busy for a while ^^
[22:06:49] <MatthiasVance> Interesting stuff!
[22:07:07] <MatthiasVance> What are the papers about? Also you do C++?
[22:09:57] <biberu> MatthiasVance: this is the one with the papers: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1416932.Software_Fundamentals
[22:10:46] <biberu> saw it recommended somewhere, just got it out of curiosity
[22:11:33] <MatthiasVance> I hope I can start to read more again soon ðŸ˜„
[22:12:18] <biberu> c++ happens infrequently, but i heard that book contained a good discussion on architecture too
[22:13:17] <biberu> and like learning fp much of what i learned from c++ has been valuable elsewhere
