[00:30:29] <Hydragyrum> so I've got a .wv (wavpack lossless audio) and a cue sheet to go with it, what might I use to convert that to per-track FLAC?
[00:35:03] <ThePendulum> what os?
[00:36:03] <ThePendulum> on linux I've used cuebreakpoints, shnsplit and cuetag, you'll probably want to do the conversion separate from the splitting
[00:36:38] <Hydragyrum> yeah I'm on linux
[00:39:56] <Hydragyrum> is there any particular reason to split before or after conversion?
[00:40:27] <ThePendulum> I guess you can convert the source wav to flac and see how it goes, don't really have any particular reason to question it, just thought maybe it could shift it ever so slightly, but it shouldn't
[00:41:42] <Allie> Hydragyrum: split first. it won't have an impact on audio fidelity, but it'll be faster since you only have one encoding step
[00:42:40] <ThePendulum> does flac splitting require less encoding than wav?
[00:42:56] <Hydragyrum> ope shnsplit doesn't support wavpack
[00:43:11] <Hydragyrum> guess I'm converting first
[00:43:37] <ThePendulum> make a back-up lol
[00:44:12] <Hydragyrum> why? I'm not overwriting the original
[00:44:26] <ThePendulum> I have messed it up before
[00:45:09] <Hydragyrum> well now I have the flac and the wv
[00:46:06] *** Quits: apebot (~api@89.17.152.47) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:51:46] <Hydragyrum> yeah that was easy
[00:56:23] <ThePendulum> got it all the way? nice
[00:57:57] <Hydragyrum> and none of the things screwed up and dropped the quality, which I was sorta concerned I'd need some options for (i.e. mp3 encoders often love to pick low quality)
[00:58:34] <ThePendulum> what's the thing with cue files anyway? why do people use that over split files?
[00:59:14] <Hydragyrum> I don't know
[00:59:16] <Hydragyrum> it's a pain
[00:59:55] <Hydragyrum> but for this thing, the only lossless torrent I could find was single-file with cue (and the file was in some format called wavpack, not even flac or normal wav)
[01:00:34] <ThePendulum> yeah, spent so much time splitting and tagging them. always amazed how they go through all this effort of ripping and uploading files, but don't curate it in any way
[01:01:21] <Hydragyrum> when I rip I usually just push the buttons the right way and it goes and gets the tracknames and whatnot off the internet if it didn't already have them
[01:01:38] <Hydragyrum> and puts it in separate files with all the metadata and the right format

[01:03:04] <ThePendulum> like do I call it "In The End (Tommee Profitt, Mellin Gi & Fleurie Remix)", or put that info in the comment, or put them as the artist and then the original artist in the comment, or in a dedicated original artist column
[01:03:35] <Hydragyrum> true enough
[01:04:23] <Hydragyrum> I usually only deal with originals and covers, rather than remixes by other artists (though I'd probably put the OG in the artist field and the remix in the comment)
[01:04:52] <ThePendulum> I used to have a brilliantly curated Iron Maiden collection with high resolution album covers, don't quite remember why I got rid of it, took me ages lol
[01:05:17] <ThePendulum> I have quite a bit of electronic music as well so some level or remix or featured artist is inevitable

[20:17:35] <Fiji> you're dutch, right? there's a part of taiwan that still has some dutch signs - leftover from when the dutch ruled it :P

[20:19:06] <Fiji> interesting read
[20:21:44] <ThePendulum> apparently it can be spelled either Macau or Macao
[20:22:09] <ThePendulum> just like it can be spelled either spelled or spelt
[20:22:18] <Fiji> yeah, just depends on if you want to be closer to the portuguese or kind-of anglicization of it (macao vs. macau)
[20:22:37] <Fiji> well international english spelling is wrong, just american english is right. i know this because i'm american
[20:23:57] <ThePendulum> looking up what shit we did in taiwan is not going to be good is it
[20:24:10] <Fiji> uh, actually it's not so bad
[20:24:25] <Fiji> you guys didnt hold it for long, it's actually a major point of pride among chinese who know the history
[20:24:32] <ThePendulum> "The Dutch also attempted to convert the aboriginal inhabitants to Christianity, and suppress aspects of traditional culture that they found disagreeable, such as head hunting, forced abortion and public nakedness."
[20:24:47] <ThePendulum> that started off bad, but ended... reasonable
[20:25:02] <Fiji> i mean, the natives of taiwan are treated like shit by the chinese there today
[20:25:08] <Fiji> so i wouldn't feel bad about that lol

[21:04:24] <skye0_mobile> >"Cassidy’s proposal would give Illinoisans the right to seek at least $10,000 in damages against anyone who causes an unwanted pregnancy — even if it resulted from consensual sex"
[21:04:29] <skye0_mobile> good
[21:04:52] <skye0_mobile> i do come from a background where abortion is frowned upon and illegal but i do find the idea of women being baby-making machines to be abhorrent
[21:05:08] <skye0_mobile> then again men haven't proven themselves to be great at anything beyond keeping the clockwork of civilization going

[21:13:18] <skye0_mobile> It's apparently the worst in Canada in the developed world
[21:13:46] <skye0_mobile> I live in the UK, not as cheap as in India but then again most of India doesn't have access to a computer or phone to the same degree that we do

[23:26:55] <skye0_mobile> I'm feeling a bit tied about Dropbox Paper. I like how it's far more minimalist than like Google Docs or Google Keep but dislike it's all tied to Dropbox (which no one seems to use anyway these days).

[23:35:33] <skye0_mobile> hm, according to all this, cryptee looks the best alternative. i have standard notes but basically even markdown formatting is paywalled

[23:43:34] <skye0_mobile> hmm, annoyingly, cryptee requires me to use it in a browser
[23:43:43] <skye0_mobile> even on mobile
[23:43:54] <skye0_mobile> but then again dropbox paper has had issues with the mobile app
