[06:54:43] <gwern> why? what on urbit is worth inheriting all its inanity/insanity?
[06:55:33] <gwern> (I have yet to see a single app or usecase or even repository of content on urbit I'd consider half as useful or interesting as gwern.net alone)
[06:56:20] <adiabatic> gwern: nobody's even trying to attempt to solve the "I have some pictures of my kids that I want to share with a few select friends, and none of us are technical" problem in a way that doesn't involve a central repository, like, say, Facebook
[06:57:06] <dbohdan[phone]> The global partially scarce account system, for one
[06:57:20] <adiabatic> Some of the discussion groups I'm in on Urbit are #lesswrong-tier.
[06:58:22] <dbohdan[phone]> And P2P applications being the default the system is designed around building
[07:01:08] <gwern> adiabatic: that sure is bad. I also don't see how Urbit solves it in the least
[07:02:09] <adiabatic> They seem to have the infrastructure in place for it even though all hosted files depend on an S3-alike currently. Nobody else is even trying, though.
[07:02:38] <adiabatic> One of the weird things about Urbit is that, like git, the storage requirements for a ship always increase.
[07:03:18] <saturn2> urbit gives you secure peer to peer message passing, pictures of kids are one thing those messages could be
[07:04:38] <adiabatic> I mean, I'm rooting for it, but there are a bunch of reasons why I don't shill it, even tongue-in-cheek. The best sales pitch going for it right now is "use it to talk with people who aren't horrified by cgy"
[07:04:47] <PapuaHardyNet> what is cgy
[07:04:52] <adiabatic> curtis yarvin
[07:05:05] <gwern> never seen cgy. is that an urbitism?
[07:05:12] <adiabatic> maybe?
[07:05:15] <saturn2> currently you have to be waaaaay more technical to use urbit than even running your own web server, but in theory immutable state could make things a lot harder to screw up
[07:05:22] <adiabatic> ^
[07:06:00] <adiabatic> if you want to share stuff in public, a web server (or gemini server, if you want to retvrn) is the way to go
[07:06:45] <adiabatic> but the comparison to Urbit isn't "Web server"; it's "Web server plus a PHP (or similar) program"
[07:13:45] <dbohdan[phone]> Disclosure: While I expect Urbit to fail (P>0.9), I got a star in case it does not
[07:14:19] <adiabatic> does your star have a cool name and/or sigil
[07:15:25] <dbohdan[phone]> ~fordev = "for developers/development"
[07:15:35] <PapuaHardyNet> sweet
[07:15:41] <adiabatic> That is _very_ cool.
[07:15:44] <gwern> I don't expect it to really 'fail'. what major decentralized P2P network has ever truly shutdown, down to zero nodes?
[07:16:17] <adiabatic> holy shit, you've got a damn-cool sigil, too: https://urbit.live/~fordev
[07:16:17] <Robomot> Urbit Live (~fordev on Urbit Live)
[07:16:33] <dbohdan[phone]> PapuaHardyNet, adiabatic: You think? Nice. I thought it was the least worst name I could get.
[07:17:13] <adiabatic> if you ever want to cash out you'll probably do pretty well for a good name + sigil like that. usually, "good name" and "good sigil" are orthogonal
[07:18:49] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah! I'd buy it from you if I could, even though I don't care about urbit at all.
[07:19:46] <adiabatic> gwern: you can say it fails if it's a ghost town kept alive by people who have to do retrocomputing to connect to it (keeping around Intel computers even though the rest of the world is on ARM or that four-letter thing that's even more indie) 
[07:20:27] <PapuaHardyNet> four letter? AMD? SPARC? oh, RISC
[07:20:33] <adiabatic> No, not RISC.
[07:20:45] <dbohdan[phone]> adiabatic: Awesome. I haven't been following the market or Urbit in general.
[07:21:08] <adiabatic> do you get the emails from tlon
[07:21:35] <dbohdan[phone]> Yes, that's my only source of news about it
[07:22:39] <PapuaHardyNet> "Talos™ II PowerAI™ Development System [...]  One NVIDIA® RTX 2070 GPU [...] proprietary NVIDIA® driver stack [...]" https://raptorcs.com/content/TL2PA1/intro.html
[07:22:40] <Robomot> Raptor Computing Systems::TL2PA1 Intro (Talos™ II PowerAI™ Development System)
[07:23:18] <saturn2> adiabatic: mill?
[07:25:17] <dbohdan[phone]> gwern: Right. What I mean is, fail to gain even modest adoption.
[07:27:10] <adiabatic> saturn2: no…ESR was shilling it because of something something open-source firmware. I think there was an R in it.
[07:27:22] <adiabatic> Like, it's used in hard-disk drive firmware.
[07:28:11] <saturn2> oh, mips?
[07:28:34] <adiabatic> NT 3.5 ran on MIPS. Probably not it.
[07:29:29] <ardent[m]> I have a planet, it's the only/first active one with fillys in its name
[07:29:53] <ardent[m]> (yes I know iceman, before you ask)
[07:30:06] <adiabatic> I don't.
[07:30:39] <saturn2> mips, risc, and mill are the only 4 letter ones i can think of
[07:31:10] <adiabatic> I thought RISC was a style, not a name of a real instruction set
[07:31:46] <saturn2> it's both

[08:00:41] <gwern> this looks like the usual latex problem I don't think we can fix
[08:01:34] <dbohdan[phone]> Is being anti-crypto in tech counter-signaling at this point? It seems the default with high-status FAANG developers. I am not sure about the rank and file. "Proof-of-work will ruin the climate" is a higher-status objection than "it's a scam".
[08:02:13] <adiabatic> seems like normal (virtue) signaling
[08:02:33] <Ralith> ^
[08:02:43] <gwern> it being green is much cleverer and thus high-status
[08:02:53] <dbohdan[phone]> Fair enough
[08:03:36] <saturn2> i'd say the scamminess is closer to the real reason though
[08:04:34] <adiabatic> the handful of anti-crypto noises I've heard is mostly around the green parts, although this is only limited to bitcoin and the mainstream stuff
[08:04:42] <adiabatic> or NFTs
[08:04:45] <saturn2> or maybe "unauthorized entrepreneurship" generally
[08:05:18] <adiabatic> "they're reinventing why we have all these regulations against this and that" is a distant second objection
[08:05:25] <adiabatic> (N=3, all on the same podcast)
[08:05:30] <gwern> DIMWIT crypto is a scam MIDWIT noooo it's an incredible new way to organize and internet 2.0 the web 3.0 of money JEDI crypto is not green
[08:05:41] <gwern> or at least, that's how it looks to them
[08:07:52] <dbohdan[phone]> It seems like it does
[08:09:57] <PapuaHardyNet> proof-of-work is still quite scary in my opinion
[08:11:03] <saturn2> you said it yourself, they're high-status FAANG developers. crypto bros have a source of money that's independent of the hierarchy they've climbed, so they're mad
[08:12:31] <dbohdan[phone]> This, too
[08:13:17] <gwern> there's definitely a lot of angry FOMO
[08:13:31] <gwern> hasn't been quite like this since the mobile goldrush
[08:14:48] <ardent[m]> imo sustainability is important to allow a more consumerist world (and this is a statement that will get most environmental types irrationally angry)
[08:15:32] <ivan> I haven't climbed a legible status hierarchy and yet I do not like PoW blockchains
[08:16:28] <ardent[m]> I generally like PoW because it permits policy hardforks (PoS has the fundamental issue that the majority can just stake both coins and control both)
[08:19:00] <ardent[m]> the best way I can put it is a hardfork on PoS forks your ballot into two so you still get a vote on both, PoW only gives you one vote across them, so if you're ideologically motivated you have to choose to what degree you want to support each
[08:19:59] <ardent[m]> I'm obviously leaving out a lot about the specifics of validators etc, but this is generally true
[08:22:43] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah it makes sense

[10:48:31] <PlanckWalk> I don't know of any such utility, but I'm not even sure what sort of meaning to ascribe to "lines" there.
[10:49:03] <PlanckWalk> Do you mean something like "if the rendering area was infinitely wide"?

(Not a flashlight. Something for lighting a room.) A portable music player (the type without a big screen) full of podcasts and audiobooks is nice to have, too.

[13:39:23] <dbohdan[phone]> Yeah. Why is your AM dodgy? I thought it worked just about anywhere.

[13:43:45] <synthmeat> there's a team of women running circles right over the road of my window
[13:44:07] <synthmeat> i should buy a binoculars as well. for survival, you know.
[14:03:55] <synthmeat> one week of progress with handling keratoconus on my own. ~20% better vision in the affected eye.
[14:05:21] <synthmeat> there's this french ophthalmologist that's been arguing the same. i should reach out to him.
[14:06:28] <synthmeat> people, stop knnuckle-rubbing yer eyes (or rubbing a lot at all) or sleeping in a way to puts any pressure to cornea
[14:06:38] <synthmeat> *way that puts
[14:09:22] <dbohdan[phone]> "On your own"? Did you have an ineffective treatment prescribed by a doctor before?
[14:10:18] <synthmeat> they missed it at all a year ago. few weeks back they suggested immediate surgery (cross-linking) with scleral lenses after that
[14:10:46] <synthmeat> they even found it upon my insistence to check. and machine said "keratoconus" pretty clearly
[14:11:02] <dbohdan[phone]> That sucks
[14:11:46] <synthmeat> incentives weren't aligned (and i have low trust in doctors in the first place; not my first rodeo being right) so i triple-checked that shit out
[14:13:02] <synthmeat> my general impression are they're pretty bad with anything that happens to <1% of people. maaaaybe >1‰
[14:14:26] <synthmeat> also, the father of the guy that was supposed to do surgery is a free mason, so there's that. i don't trust them as far as i can throw them either :D
[14:14:26] <dbohdan[phone]> My experience with doctors has been the same. I even put in similar words. If you are a rare case, you are out of luck.
[14:17:13] <dbohdan[phone]> The sooner computer-"assisted" (actually, human-assisted) diagnosis becomes the norm, the better
[14:18:30] <synthmeat> i don't know. it's not the science i don't trust, it's the people and their incentives/quality.
[14:19:56] <dbohdan[phone]> That is exactly what having a computer there can help with
[14:20:31] <dbohdan[phone]> So now you are doing something different and your eye is improving? 
[14:22:03] <synthmeat> code with an eye patch, to reduce strain on the eye. stopped rubbing at all. trying to not sleep on that side (and failed mostly) BUT i purchased a "3D" sleep mask that leaves room for eyeball, and that seems to be working great.
[14:23:29] <synthmeat> stare at various distances throughout the day (hence the girls running across the road)
[14:24:46] <dbohdan[phone]> Of course
[14:26:02] <dbohdan[phone]> This sounds rather cheaper and less likely to cause side effects than eye surgery if it works. Do you have an objective metric you track for improvement?
[14:26:38] <synthmeat> yup. there's a led on front of my mac mini, and i mark the deviation (under roughly same time/same lightning conditions)
[14:26:57] <synthmeat> always at arms length
[14:30:39] <synthmeat> also, i may have an idea for a better eyedness test

[14:30:42] <Robomot> Ocular dominance - Wikipedia [Determination] (A person's dominant eye "is determined by subjective alignment of two objects presented at a stereodisparity far beyond Panum's area".[22] There are a number of ways to do this:)
[14:31:01] <PapuaHardyNet> oh wait, you were putting things in your eye recently, yeah?
[14:31:07] <synthmeat> shush
[14:31:13] <synthmeat> :)
[14:31:21] <synthmeat> AFTER this though
[14:31:27] <synthmeat> nope
[14:31:29] <synthmeat> that's a lie
[14:31:32] <synthmeat> it was before this
[14:32:41] <synthmeat> yeah, about 2 years before i noticed first issues.
[14:34:26] <synthmeat> anyways, eyedness test... you have 2 people with with faces looking at each other and they do 4 single-eye measurements that amount to answers to question "am i looking at your open eye with my open eye?"
[14:34:49] <synthmeat> so, 4 measurements, 8 answers
[14:35:23] <synthmeat> face distance should be about half a meter, i think
[14:35:38] <dbohdan[phone]> Your progress sounds good. I guess the risk is that what you are doing isn't improving the underlying condition but only reducing the eyestrain compounding on top of it or something like that. I'd get another doctor to assess it periodically and see if I improved.
[14:36:05] <synthmeat> yeah, i'll get checked up at least yearly
[14:36:56] <synthmeat> anyone has an SO around to test and write down the questions/answers? :D
[14:37:26] <dbohdan[phone]> I'd start more often (to not miss the window for surgery if it is truly necessary) then go yearly
[14:37:49] <synthmeat> ok. but this is a pretty reliable measure, i'm sure of it.
[14:37:53] <synthmeat> i'd bet on it :)
[14:37:59] <synthmeat> mac mini led ftw

[14:39:57] <synthmeat> it's fine, we'll forgive ourselves

[14:42:58] <synthmeat> i'd have two more stories to it. persistent vertigo and rsi.
[14:44:29] <dbohdan[phone]> How did you address these? I have RSI. Using the mouse as little as possible (and then a trackball) and wearing wrist braces helped with it.
[14:45:13] <dbohdan[phone]> I mean that I use a trackball if I have to use a mouse
[14:45:42] <synthmeat> exercise and split keyboard with no mouse (but a trackpoint)

[21:55:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> "How is it possible to not have that??"
[21:56:06] <adiabatic> also you'd probably need to explain "online publishing platform"

[23:24:54] <dbohdan[phone]> I remember a forum post or online article published a very long time ago in Russian in which the author said he could no longer fall asleep without the sound of his PC working. People who live or (especially?) grew up by the sea seem to find its sound to help them sleep. Last summer I saw a lot of young mothers with baby strallers and young children in my town of Lutuhyne. They were born into a particular soundscape that 
[23:24:54] <dbohdan[phone]> was there even before this escalation. Therefore, in the future we will have YouTube content like "Relaxing Sounds To Fall Asleep To - Distant Artillery (10 hours)".
