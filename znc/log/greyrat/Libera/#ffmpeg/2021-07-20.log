[00:08:50] <DennisF> Obviously after posting here you find the bug. And it's obviously behind the keyboard...
[00:13:21] <Case_Of> I have an issue with libaom-av1 option threads in aom-params https://0x0.st/-V1R.txt
[00:13:32] <Case_Of> why does it says it cant be found?
[00:14:52] <Case_Of> I’ve version 3.1.1 of libaom this time

[02:11:58] <kepstin> that's kind of old tho, i don't know if there's better modern options

[02:16:13] <kepstin> one thing to note if you do try bchunk is that it needs raw pcm audio, not a wav/flac file. you can of course use ffmpeg to convert the audio to raw pcm, like "ffmpeg -i audio.flac -f s16le audio.bin"
[02:17:27] <kepstin> looks like "shnsplit" (from "shntool" package) is probably a better option, it should be able to read wav/flac directly
[02:18:56] <kepstin> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CUE_Splitting has some examples of how to use both tools

[04:35:21] <intrac> I'm trying to convert an .mp3 with an embedded jpeg image to an .mp4 h264 video (for playback on a limited media player)
[04:35:55] <intrac> ffmpeg identifies the image and maps it to the output as h264 with a simple -c:v libx264 setting
[04:36:19] <intrac> but I suspect it's not actually encoding at 25 fps - judging from the speed of the encode
[04:36:49] <intrac> also, the seeking of the .mp4 is a bit problematic
[04:37:14] <intrac> if I was using a separate image as an input, I could just loop it and set the required fps
[04:37:37] <intrac> but how might I set the fps of this image embedded in the mp3?

[04:43:20] <kepstin> it's only a single frame, the fps is meaningless
[04:43:27] <intrac> on the source, right
[04:43:47] <intrac> but I'm hoping there's a way to repeat that single frame to generate compliant 25 fps video for the .mp4
[04:43:53] <kepstin> you can use the "loop" video filter to turn the single frame into a repeated frame suitable for a video
[04:43:59] *** Joins: deltab (~deltab@user/deltab)
[04:44:50] <kepstin> for example, use "-vf loop=loop=-1:size=1" to create an infinite looping video, then the "-shortest" option to make ffmpeg cut the video when the audio ends
[04:45:25] <intrac> ah, I'll try that

[04:52:59] <intrac> kepstin: sorry - if you said anything in the last 7 mins, I might not have picked it up
[04:53:24] <intrac> using that video filter caused ffmpeg to eat up all my RAM and lock the system
[04:53:44] <kepstin> i'd have to see your full command line to diagnost that
[04:53:45] <intrac> here's the full params: ffmpeg -i music.mp3 -pix_fmt yuv420p -vf loop=loop=-1:size=1 -c:v libx264 -c:a copy -c:v libx264 -g 32 -keyint_min 15 -strict normal -profile:v main -preset fast -crf 22 -shortest -r 25 output.mp4
[04:54:24] <kepstin> well, the second -c:v is a bit redundant there, but that otherwise looks fine
[04:54:25] <intrac> the encode goes very slowly (sub 1 fps and with a high drop= count)
[04:54:42] <kepstin> can i see the output of that command?
[04:54:48] <intrac> ah, yep. duplication error there.
[04:58:02] <intrac> kepstin: yep, uploading now
[04:59:52] <intrac> kepstin: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JfCkuCBG6y7kbA5D0EqlREFXRd7RXKcn/view?usp=sharing
[05:00:38] <intrac> I did a ctrl+c within a few seconds as my system seems to start paging to RAM and slowing down badly
[05:01:20] <kepstin> oh, i see, the input fps isn't actually 25 for some reason. easy fix is to add an "-r 25" input option (before the -i)
[05:01:48] <kepstin> it's trying to make a 90000fps video, then drop frames down to 25 right now, lol
[05:03:53] <intrac> hm, starting with: ffmpeg -r 25 -i input.mp3
[05:04:12] <intrac> still the same issue:
[05:04:16] <intrac> Stream #0:1: Video: mjpeg, yuvj444p(pc, bt470bg/unknown/unknown), 1920x1080 [SAR 1:1 DAR 16:9], 90k tbr, 90k tbn, 90k tbc
[05:04:23] <furq> -vf fps=25,loop...
[05:04:40] <intrac> ah, was *just* about to ask if the fps could be set as a video filter
[05:06:17] <intrac> furq: no go, using: -vf fps=25,loop=loop=-1:size=1
[05:06:27] <intrac> mediainfo reports no video track on the output file
[05:07:59] <intrac> maybe it'd be easier just to extract the image and use it as a separate input: ffmpeg -r 25 -f image2 -i album_cover.jpg -i audio.mp3 ...
[05:08:05] <furq> maybe
[05:08:07] <intrac> was just hoping to avoid that (or having to script it)
[05:08:24] <furq> you'll probably need -pix_fmt yuv420p as well
[05:08:32] <intrac> furq: yep, already got that
[05:08:40] <furq> oh yeah
[05:08:57] <intrac> without that, I get high profile 4:4:4
[05:09:28] <intrac> an embedded image is a strange source, so maybe ffmpeg's tools are lacking here
[05:10:04] <furq> they are handled kind of weird but it should still work
[05:11:27] <intrac> I've found a page which suggests using -stream_loop -1 on the input
[05:16:56] <intrac> no luck so far
[05:23:57] <intrac> for now I'll extract the image and use it as an image2 input
[05:24:02] <intrac> thanks for the suggestions

[22:07:40] <lenswipe> Hey folks
[22:08:24] <lenswipe> I previously compiled an (old) version of ffmpeg with NDI support. I'm coming back to it now and I can't remember what I did....I need to somehow tell make/configure where it should look for NDI, can someone refresh my memory on how to do this?
[22:08:48] <lenswipe> i.e: does ffmpeg just expect it to be installed as a system library already, or should I explicitly give ./configure a path?
