[00:01:46] <PapuaHardyNet> there's something that has been bothering me for a while now, something I call the "French Question"
[00:02:44] <PapuaHardyNet> I've read multiple different sources to get an overview of the AI researcher demographic, especially the immigrant AI researcher demographic, in preparation for becoming one
[00:02:46] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: synced. looks like I was mostly right about chrome's behavior: https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16447843073846797.png it's smart enough to not download twice, even though it still treats them as 2 separate requests

[00:03:24] <PapuaHardyNet> now, France is the biggest source of current NIPS-published AI researchers
[00:03:33] <PapuaHardyNet> in Europe I mean
[00:03:37] <PapuaHardyNet> overall it is China
[00:04:13] <PapuaHardyNet> next, France is also the place in Europe with the highest concentration of current NIPS-published AI researchers working there
[00:04:15] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: should we version fonts.css as well? (fonts.css still has single-quoted /static/ paths and so doesn't get versioned.) I think that would get rid of even that little 3ms blip for the non-versioned, but maybe there's some reason to not version in fonts.css?
[00:04:45] <PapuaHardyNet> third, France is ALSO the place that is considered, by current NIPS-like published AI researchers, to be the easiest country to immigrate to, to work as an AI researcher
[00:05:19] <PapuaHardyNet> source for first and second claim: https://macropolo.org/digital-projects/the-global-ai-talent-tracker/the-state-of-european-ai-talent/

[00:06:03] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: france is the biggest NIPS publisher? huh. they must all be in the math and theory tracks or something, because I sure don't recall many french surnames on the kind of papers I read
[00:06:20] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern: in Europe! in the European demographic
[00:06:48] <gwern> yeah, even for europe, I just don't think about france at all in NNs. bandits, sure, plenty of french researchers there, but not nns
[00:07:00] <PapuaHardyNet> I know! I don't get this.
[00:07:43] <PapuaHardyNet> Obviously, US is the place to study and work if you want to work in AI or AI alignment, but this one thing has been bugging me for quite a while
[00:08:03] <PapuaHardyNet> I decided to explain it in case you or anyone else here had an insight into this.
[00:09:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: fonts.css not being versioned is not because of single quotes... there's no code that would version it
[00:09:24] <gwern> oh. well, even if it was, the single quotes would stop it
[00:09:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure
[00:09:47] <gwern> maybe we should double-quote it just in case? seems like the sort of thing that 3 years from now might fuck one up
[00:09:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well
[00:09:56] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: what is the mystery here, exactly?
[00:09:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[00:10:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also I can probably write said code without too much trouble
[00:10:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm

[00:10:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah let's see if I can go ahead and do that
[00:11:34] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: aside from that, https://www.gwern.net/static/font/ssp/SourceSansPro-BASIC-Semibold.ttf?v=1604173830 continues to trigger non-preload-use warnings. just that 1. I've checked /About, /Danbooru2021, /Faces, /GPT-3, /Links, /Screwfly, /index, /newsletter/2021/06 (some of which are very long and complicated pages), and they all trigger just that one warning. checking, it's the...
[00:11:34] <Robomot> application/font-sfnt (-1 byte)
[00:11:40] <gwern> ...sans 600-weight (200 bigger than 'regular'). I guess we never use the sans in a big header or anything which would ever trigger that use. so that should probably be removed
[00:12:29] <gwern> (yeah, even /Lorem doesn't use it, apparently)
[00:12:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sans 600? Yeah, makes sense
[00:13:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> But
[00:13:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Something must've motivated its inclusion in this set of just five family-style-weight combos in the preloads
[00:14:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> I can't imagine either of us just went "you know what, let's preload this random variant of a font for no reason whatsoever"
[00:14:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Let me skim the .css files and see if I can't figure this out
[00:14:57] <gwern> it was probably a confusion or typo way back when. wouldn't surprise me if I did it, in which case 'lol'
[00:16:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> But a typo for what? How do you type "Semibold" by accident?
[00:16:48] <gwern> it would've been an ssp/ssfp confusion. the paths are so long and so similar
[00:17:18] <gwern> I assume we do use the serif semibold
[00:18:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes but I found the cause, and it's a legit one
[00:18:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... hm, or did I
[00:19:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> No I didn't
[00:19:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah ok I dunno
[00:20:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Let's remove it I guess.
[00:20:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe this really ought to be serif though
[00:20:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Isn't that used in the page heading
[00:20:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> It totally is!
[00:20:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow this really is a sans/serif mixup
[00:21:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'll fix

[02:22:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> The distortionary effects of the pressures of commercial production and distribution on the average modern person's food experience is one of the most underappreciated things I've encountered in my life
[02:24:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, this huge, *huge* swath of the everyday experience of hundreds of millions (billions?) of people is shaped to such a degree by the practical facts of what foodstuffs and ingredients have what properties relevant to commercial-scale production, storage, distribution...

[04:18:34] <gwern> hm. if it was a mechanical result of slow indexing, I would expect them all to have the same curve, more or less
[04:18:41] <spxtr> right
[04:19:00] <gwern> you would either need some extreme offsetting trends, or strongly field-differing publication speed to produce a variety of staggered and even upturning curves

[05:08:49] <adiabatic> yeah, it's a great source of Urbit memes
[05:09:23] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: 1981? wow, that's kinda weirdly early. also, SF has enough of a financial district to support weirdo art magazines?
[05:09:40] <adiabatic> gwern: the past is a foreign country
[05:10:05] <gwern> I wonder if SF tech really existed in 1981, even, or if it was basically all elsewhere in the valley
[05:10:07] <adiabatic> the SF of 1981? May be?
[05:10:19] <adiabatic> I figure elsewhere

[05:13:53] <ardent[m]> tbh "nobody cared who I was until I put on the mask... then they kept their distance because they assumed I was contagious" would be a decent equilibrium post-Covid

[05:14:06] <ardent[m]> post-2020 really

[05:19:53] <gwern> that looks suspiciously smooth

[05:20:19] <gwern> are these cumulative?
[05:20:45] <spxtr> it shouldn't be cumulative, some decrease

[05:21:41] <gwern> I mean, I know it's a popular topic, but really now
[05:22:12] <spxtr> the vast majority of it is absolute trash
[05:24:13] <spxtr> dark matter attracts a lot of theorists who write many papers per year that have no experimental relevance
[05:24:38] <rmmh> you know who else wrote theoretical papers? that's right. einstein.
[05:25:31] <spxtr> he published 4 papers in 1905 and they called it a miracle year
[05:26:01] <spxtr> meanwhile, most researchers nowadays consider 4 to be a slow  year

[06:21:41] <feepbot> <gwern> 'n 2014, the executives at a brand-new start-up called Andela made a decision whose consequences they would only understand much later. Andela’s model was to recruit and train promising African engineers, then place them at Western tech firms...In the summer of 2019, a glowing BBC article misrepresented how much the fellows were paid, saying they made a third of what
[06:21:41] <feepbot> clients paid Andela, when in fact the amount varied and was sometimes lower. First, the #general Slack channel lit up with complaints, mostly from employees who had been talking among themselves about the issue for months. “I would like to know, did Andela at any point in time tell any news source we get 1/3?” wrote one. “This info has been flying around for a long time and
[06:21:41] <feepbot> it does not seem to bother Andela.” In a private employee-only Slack, they took to calling Andela “The Plantation.” Eventually, the fellows circulated a petition asking for higher pay—an effort organized over Slack. But by late 2019, the issue was moot: The company—citing “market demands for more senior engineering talent”—had laid off 400 people and shut down its
[06:21:46] <feepbot> fellowship program.' https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/slack-office-trouble/620173/ lmao. so they were overpaid the entire time. bet they didn't become appreciative afterwards, but even more self-righteous

[06:37:02] <PapuaHardyNet> s/PapuaHardyNet/gwern/
[06:37:10] <gwern> so they were being paid more than the market wage, and andela was eating the losses, and eventually discovered oh shit there is no path to profitability at all and all the customers have caught on and we're dying
[06:37:56] <gwern> and the ingrates were calling it 'the plantation' and lobbying for *more* pay lmao. yeah they sure were exploiting and enslaving you, gl finding a replacement job paying even as much. oh, you didn't? I see
[06:38:36] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:40:30] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, you are right. the ending of the article does imply that they were running on a loss, which implies that the employees were being paid more than what value they were providing to their clients (or what the startup was earning)
[06:42:04] <gwern> even if it wasn't a startup, it is extremely unlikely that, especially given the time period, that they were being paid the market wage and then the demand abruptly dropped and they were fired then and there
[06:43:32] <gwern> demand during that period would really have gone up (FANG comp eg increased massively over that time). so if you get fired at the end of a period of such escalating income, that means you were never profitable and the program simply ran out its string or the customers wised up after enough expensive experience

[07:13:30] <Obormot\Arcturus>  metadata for all of this to work
[07:14:18] <gwern> typed links is the next step, yes, but heck, even HTML makes those pretty feasible. just stick on a class or data- attribute... that's secretly how gwern.net works

[09:34:43] <quanticle> Like, all of these anti-capitalist things that people are writing clickbait headlines about seem like really dilute versions of '70s anarchism
[09:35:17] <adiabatic> "really dilute versions of '70s anarchism" is _Bad_, though
[09:35:19] <PapuaHardyNet> so 70s anarchism was simply a counterculture movement whose main aim was rebelling against the existing culture, and not "true anarchism", correct?
[09:35:51] <quanticle> adiabatic: It's bad, but is it bad enough for me to care about?
[09:35:53] <quanticle> Answer: no
[09:35:58] <PapuaHardyNet> and the same thing is happening again, with political excuses used to indulge oneself in ways that are a detriment to society, while participating on what is ostensibly a "cool" counterculture
[09:36:24] <quanticle> adiabatic: Like, wake me up when they're bombing banks, okay?
[09:36:57] <quanticle> And hijacking planes and flying them to Cuba
[09:37:04] <PapuaHardyNet> what's in Cuba
[09:37:16] <quanticle> Communism
[09:37:49] <adiabatic> this is the unexciting normalization of bad behavior
[09:38:04] <PapuaHardyNet> exactly, what adiabatic points out
[09:38:06] <adiabatic> any costs that I bear from this will be distributed to me in the forms of higher prices
[09:38:18] <adiabatic> to cover for what is euphemistically called "shrinkage"
[09:38:58] <quanticle> Except they won't because stores are capable of charging different prices in different locations. The costs to this will be distributed among the poor people that these "tips" aim to help, but I don't give a shit, because I live in a suburb.
[09:39:06] <adiabatic> one of the big interesting political-engineering works going on right now is "how can we get Singapore without getting North Korea?"
[09:39:39] <PapuaHardyNet> get a Lee Kuan Yew, of course
[09:40:28] <adiabatic> this is movement toward something that increases transaction costs because you have to put everything behind lock and key in order to purchase it
[09:40:29] <quanticle> Do we want Singapore? Singapore isn't actually all that good at making things. They're just a financial hub. If you wanted to make a Singapore, it's easy, just carve London or Manhattan off from its host country.
[09:40:40] <quanticle> What we want is closer to Taiwan or South Korea.
[09:41:07] <quanticle> Or Germany, I guess.
[09:41:20] <quanticle> Or Finland, but as we all know Finland isn't real
[09:41:50] <adiabatic> AFAICT Singapore is a multiracial and multiethnic fairly-high-trust society where there are no no-go zones at night for women walking alone.
[09:41:55] <quanticle> Like, Singapore gets to be Singapore because all the poors live across the border in Malaysia
[09:42:02] <quanticle> And come over on guest worker visas
[09:42:20] <PapuaHardyNet> who is "we" here? who wants another Singapore?
[09:42:24] <quanticle> And can be deported if they misbehave
[09:42:44] <adiabatic> I could say "I want Japan" or "I want Finland", but that's cheating and impossible barring massive forced population movements that we all boo the Nazis for.
[09:43:00] <quanticle> Like I said, carve off Zone 1 London or Manhattan off into its own city-state and boom: instant Singapore
[09:46:22] <quanticle> Singapore gets to be a high-trust multiethnic society for the same reason that the Harvard campus is a high-trust multi-ethnic society.
[10:00:27] <saturn2> PapuaHardyNet: "true anarchism" isn't real, anarchism is always based on petulant rebellion and wishing really hard that power would just disappear
[10:05:39] *** Joins: feep[work] (~mathis@195.50.168.194)
[10:07:02] <saturn2> and these days even politics that potentially could be real aren't real, because all politics is about hanging out with a subculture or engaging in political fandom on the bottom, and personally accumulating clout and money for those on top
[10:08:11] <saturn2> (in western countries)
[10:08:29] <nshepperd2> true anarchism is being the psychopath who takes advantage of the petulant rebellion
[10:09:04] <nshepperd2> warlordism or something
[10:23:10] <feep[work]> > engaging in political fandom on the bottom
[10:23:11] <feep[work]> kinky
[10:24:09] <feep[work]> .note feep try ? for error propagation
[10:27:21] <feep[work]> https://saagarjha.com/blog/2020/05/10/why-we-at-famous-company-switched-to-hyped-technology/ lol
[10:27:22] <Robomot> Why we at $FAMOUS_COMPANY Switched to $HYPED_TECHNOLOGY (Saagar Jha's website.)
[10:28:22] <feep[work]> Luckily, all of our software is designed from the ground up for introspectability, and using some BPF scripts we copied from Brendan Gregg’s website^W^W^W^W^W^W^W^W^W^W our in-house profiling tools 
[10:28:26] <feep[work]> oh god it's too real
[10:29:18] <feep[work]> > Every metric that matters to us has increased substantially from the rewrite, and we even identified some that were no longer relevant to us, such as number of bugs, user frustration, and maintenance cost.
[10:35:16] <quanticle> "After careful consideration, we settled on rearchitecting our platform to use $FLASHY_LANGUAGE and $HYPED_TECHNOLOGY. Not only is $FLASHY_LANGUAGE popular according to the Stack Overflow developer survey, it’s also cross platform; we’re using it to reimplement our mobile apps as well."
[10:35:18] <quanticle> This is literally the reason one of the other senior developers was able to push through a switch from Angular to React. He pointed out that 1. Angular is old and most new developers are coming in with React experience and 2. React Native means that we can use a single technology to rebuild the tablet app that some of the field technicians use
[10:35:20] <quanticle> This is, of course, a terrible idea (for the company), but 1) I don't care 2) I personally kind of like React and 3) React is a lot nicer to have on one's resume than Angular and 4) I could use some more mobile dev work on my resume, so I enthusiastically voiced my support for this idea
[10:35:53] <spxtr> Resume Driven Development
[10:36:12] <quanticle> Unironically, unashamedly yes
[10:37:07] <quanticle> Also doesn't hurt that the engineer voicing this proposal has Pull™ in positively magical quantities
[10:37:13] <PapuaHardyNet> Web development and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.
[10:37:27] <quanticle> Absolutely
[10:38:35] <quanticle> However, in my defense, there are many other people who you should letterbomb before me if you want to stop web development
[10:38:55] <feep[work]> quanticle: yeah if something like that comes up I make my point against it, and then drop it because hey, I'm not paid in shares.
[10:39:09] <feep[work]> it's not my job to make sure we have a good architecture.
[10:39:22] <feep[work]> we literally have a person for that, if they discard my input :elaborate shrug:
[10:39:45] <PapuaHardyNet> that's a sustainable mentality
[10:39:51] <feep[work]> that's my thinking, yeah.
[10:40:05] <feep[work]> give longtermism a poke, then drop it
[10:41:07] <feep[work]> Never let people foist ownership on you for something you have no control over.
[10:41:33] <quanticle> feep[work]: As they say in the Amazon "core values": "Disagree and commit"
[10:41:35] <quanticle> In theory this means that you should have you say, and then the team lead should take everyone's objections into account when formulating the final plan, and then the team members should agree to follow the plan, even if less than 100% of their objections have been addressed
[10:41:37] <quanticle> In practice this means you voice an objection at the meeting, the team lead says your objection is noted but they're going to stick with the original plan anyway, and then you STFU and do your work
[10:41:39] <quanticle> I don't know why they bother with the meeting; maybe it makes them feel good to squash a stupid peasant opinion once in a while?
[10:42:09] <feep[work]> to be fair, as long as the team lead owns it, that's fine.
[10:43:09] <PapuaHardyNet> as a manager, doesn't the team lead have more leeway to spin a narrative where the failure is not the lead's decisions but the incompetence of their underlings?
[10:43:22] <PapuaHardyNet> you may not be interested in politics, but politics is interested in you
[10:43:49] <nshepperd2> then you get to write in performance review, "I made a strong contribution to <doomed project>, which was then scrapped when everyone realised it wouldn't work"
[10:44:56] <quanticle> Well, in theory the team lead owns it
[10:44:58] <quanticle> In practice the team lead gets to say in his annual review, "I created $NEW_RENDERING_FRAMEWORK, convinced 3 teams to use it, and replaced $OLD_RENDERING_FRAMEWORK, resulting in $PERF_IMPROVEMENT"
[10:45:00] <quanticle> Neglecting, of course, the fact that the perf improvement resulted entirely due to said client teams being forced to rewrite all their shit, paying special attention to perf this time because the new framework was known to be slower than the old
[10:45:02] <quanticle> Team lead then gets a headpat from management, a promotion to principal engineer and then a transfer away from the slow creeping meltdown that they've set the stage for
[10:45:04] <quanticle> I saw this happen *twice* in my 2 year tenure
[10:45:49] <nshepperd2> haha yeah
[10:45:53] <PapuaHardyNet> looks like I do have a pretty good idea of how things work in the industry :)
[10:46:09] <nshepperd2> that happened a lot at google
[10:46:17] <PapuaHardyNet> what happens to the people who are in doomed projects though quanticle?
[10:46:37] <spxtr> They try to squeeze out a promotion before abandoning ship.
[10:48:00] <PapuaHardyNet> how likely is it that you get a promotion after having been in a doomed project? seems very unlikely to me
[10:48:20] <nshepperd2> "we created a new <database>, which is better in the old one in ways $X, $Y and $Z, (and then we deprecated the old one causing hundreds of thousands of engineer hours of churn)"
[10:49:14] <nshepperd2> also all the the client teams are unhappy because they have use cases that aren't met by the new thing but that's a stretch goal
[10:49:20] <quanticle> If you're in a doomed project, you do your best and try not to piss anyone off who can be an obstacle to you tranferring out. In other words, suck it up for anywhere from six months to a year and then start networking like mad in order to find a less doomed project to work on.
[10:49:21] <quanticle> Worst case, you get fired.
[10:49:58] <quanticle> But it's fine because you have 2 years of MAGMA on your resume
[10:50:00] <quanticle> And everyone wants to hire you

[11:05:27] <PapuaHardyNet> so my laptop CPU shut down while I played gzdoom / DOOM 1993. I believe my video game days are over entirely.
[11:07:03] <PapuaHardyNet> (the only time I'll actually open up this x230 and replace the thermal paste is when I have another machine and I am unwilling to buy another laptop so it is going to be a while)
[11:08:33] <quanticle> Either that or you need to take a canned-air duster to your laptop fan. My brother complained about the same problem. I thought it was bad RAM, at first, because the computer would also crash while run MEMCHECK. But a closer examination of the hardware showed that the fan and heatsink were just extremely dusty. I cleared the dust, and now his laptop runs great once again.
[11:12:39] <quanticle> What's the resolution of the X230s display, anyway? 1600x900?
[11:13:06] <PapuaHardyNet> thanks for the heads up!
[11:13:34] <PapuaHardyNet> the resolution is 1366x768. Using a TN panel version

[11:13:58] <quanticle> Unfortunate
[11:14:49] <quanticle> My brother's laptop is from one generation newer; it's a T440p. But when I got it for him, I made sure to upgrade to the 1600x900 IPS pane.
[11:14:51] <quanticle> *panel
[11:15:18] <PapuaHardyNet> bought it second hand from a guy in Bangalore who was a FOSS proponent whose website topped HN
[11:15:31] <spxtr> I truly appreciate having tech-savvy family. No need to deal with buying/fixing family computers.
[11:16:01] <PapuaHardyNet> can't trust anyone else in India for thinkpads or any second hand stuff tbh. I'd have gone with a standard new Dell whatever if I didn't know this FOSS guy
[11:16:12] <PapuaHardyNet> oh btw, he corebooted the laptop beforehand, which was the main reason I wanted it
[11:16:17] <quanticle> Wow
[11:16:19] <adiabatic> I blew air out of my iMac a year ago and it stopped running at 140something
[11:17:13] <quanticle> spxtr: Well, my brother is tech savvy, it's just that he hadn't dusted his laptop in the 8 or so years he'd had it. I don't have to deal with the normal computer issues that people complain about.
[11:18:04] <quanticle> So is Coreboot an open source replacement for UEFI?
[11:18:20] <PapuaHardyNet> if the only reason I wanted a workstation was to run AI experiments locally, and now that I only use TPUs and run AI experiments remotely, perhaps I should simply buy a SOTA laptop
[11:18:39] <PapuaHardyNet> quanticle: that's right! it is an open source bootloader that is a replacement for BIOS / UEFI
[11:19:10] <PapuaHardyNet> he also disabled ME as much as possible so that's even better
[11:19:23] <quanticle> But, what's the point? Is it just to demonstrate your loyalty to free software, or is there a practical benefit that you get out of using Coreboot?
[11:20:02] <PapuaHardyNet> I personally always wanted a max-paranoia setup so that in the long term I can use it for risky activities like storing cryptoassets
[11:20:48] <PapuaHardyNet> not intended as a daily driver and I don't mind Intel ME or AMD PSP or UEFI or BIOS. Once you spend enough time desperate for compute, you stop worrying about privacy
[11:20:56] <Otthorn[m]> Coreboot is usually faster to boot in my experience

[21:12:27] <adiabatic> 'runs on software' and 'runs on gas' are orthogonal. Seems like Bruce Schneier's site is full of reports of pwnable cars, and broken bluetooth stacks with keyless entry permissions were way more common 10–15 years ago than electric cars were then

[21:13:28] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: mhm, by the time I get my next car in 5–10 years, the new gas cars will probably be as remotely pwnable as electric
[21:14:04] <ggreer> yeah that was going to happen with cars anyway, regardless whether they were gas or not
[21:14:19] <two2thehead> yep
[21:14:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why is that an argument against "EVs are bad"
[21:14:58] <rmmh> two2thehead: it plays into my stereotypes of atrocious Japanese and meche software engineering 
[21:15:04] <Betawolf> It's not specific to EVs, just new cars in general
[21:15:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> At best it's an argument for "EVs are only the vanguard of badness, soon everything will be bad, enjoy your less-bad gasoline car while you can, and don't buy electric [or any new cars]"
[21:15:13] <rmmh> I think it's because the big corps assign lit majors to be programmers 
[21:15:32] <adiabatic> It's not. It's more like "new gas cars are pretty near to that bad anyway, so it's not worth singling out the EVs"

[21:28:07] <Betawolf> In Google Chrome, a number of pages with video sources pop up the chromecast icon in the built-in player. I'm trying to remember if I had to configure something to make that happen or not.

[21:54:38] <CoJaBo> linear: If you get a deposit from the US Treasury, they will steal all your money lol

[21:56:44] <gwern> adiabatic: the real lesson is that, like so often in modern life, you need to abandon all shame. shame is a weakness, and for suckers!
[21:56:54] <kuudes> what does cashback mean?
[21:57:21] <linear> cash back is basically credits/cash you get after making a transaction with the CC, e.g. if I spend $100 on gas with 4% back I get a $4 credit I can apply to my CC bill (so, equiv. to cash)
[21:57:28] <adiabatic> ^
[21:57:39] <linear> i enjoy optimizing it for cards, e.g. my amazon 5% cash back has added up to..a lot recently
[21:57:55] <kuudes> who pays that?

[21:58:27] <adiabatic> I think I have to get at least $20 to get an actual cash back on my Discover card, but I can use any amount of it on amazon.com
[21:58:37] <CoJaBo> Until PNC scammed me, that was the worst thing I've ever seen a bank do

[21:59:02] <Robomot> How credit cards make money (Credit cards make money through net interest, interchange, fees, and marketing contributions.)
[21:59:12] <kuudes> I don't think we have those here
[21:59:23] <linear> CoJaBo: amazing
[21:59:48] <CoJaBo> linear: I'm still trying to get the rest of my money out of the account :/
[22:00:27] <linear> this is making me want to cancel my acct there, I don't even think I can do autopay on their card
[22:00:40] <linear> (maybe some convoluted way to find obscure support areas and fax pdf forms for it? but idk not worth my time)
[22:00:45] <CoJaBo> Due to an unrelated foulup, a business I bought something from placed an eroneous $300 hold on my account, so I wasn't able to withdraw that $300
[22:00:48] <adiabatic> kuudes: generally, as an american, foreign countries' credit cards are way wimpier and less desirable compared to bank transactions, or no better (here, you're not liable for fraudulent charges over $50, and basically all credit-card companies here will waive that too).
[22:01:40] <CoJaBo> adiabatic: PNC goes a step further by suspending your account on legitimate deposits too.
[22:02:23] <adiabatic> kuudes: which is why chip-and-pin (well, the pin part) never caught on here; since we're not responsible for fraudulent charges, we have way less incentive to be secretive about our credit card numbers (whereas, if a fraudulent charge happens from my bank account, well, the money's _gone_)
[22:02:57] <kuudes> ... how does one charge a banking account
[22:03:03] <adiabatic> with a debit card
[22:03:16] <kuudes> ah
[22:03:29] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : Someone said something that really stuck with me. You can be a bitcoin millionaire *without* being a dollar millionaire. Because you need someone to tell you the dollars for the bitcoin
[22:03:51] <two2thehead> I knew this was the case in FOREX but hadn't considered the same would apply for bitcoin
[22:03:54] <two2thehead> mildly interesting
[22:04:05] <adiabatic> a bank will partner with a credit-card provider to use its infrastructure to set things up to debit my bank account, but as far as the merchant is concerned, the money's coming from Visa
[22:04:30] <kuudes> so, visa pays the cashback money?
[22:05:17] <adiabatic> Right. This is as opposed to whatever other sort of credit-card perks one might get from a credit card (airline miles, etc.)
[22:05:53] <kuudes> airline miles?

[22:09:37] <two2thehead> Remember the lidar based mosquito detector study I shared a few years back? This is a more advanced version of it
[22:10:19] <two2thehead> tl;dr it works and works well AND works enough to function as a radar-equivalent for in-flight insects
[22:10:35] <two2thehead> the authors want the next version to be on a panning mode
[22:10:46] <two2thehead> similar to ye olde radar domes
[22:11:36] <two2thehead> Not yet real time, but if you can use it as actionable data to detect where swarms congregate for come from, you may have a higher odds of detecting and eliminating breeding grounds

[23:29:08] <capisce> I'm learning both Russian and Chinese to hedge my bets
[23:29:25] <gwern> tsk. language learning is not convex!
[23:29:49] <two2thehead> convex?
[23:30:30] <gwern> half-learning chinese and half-learning russian is not as useful as learning either chinese or russian
[23:30:46] <two2thehead> ah. non-linear. gwern +1
[23:30:56] <gwern> no, non-linear in a bad way
[23:31:31] <gwern> they could be non-linear in a good way if they were convex and had diminishing returns, say, and then half-learning 2 languages might be much more useful than learning just 1 language
[23:31:33] <capisce> well, I've learned Chinese pretty well already
[23:31:53] <gwern> (or given that both are reputed to be incredible pains in the butt, if you took them up as hobbies, it'd be more like learning 1% of chinese and 1% of russian... rather than 2% of either)
[23:32:00] <two2thehead> I'm reminded of the joke - Child: We learned to write today
[23:32:00] <two2thehead> Parent: Very good, what did you write?
[23:32:00] <two2thehead> Child: I don't know, I can't read
[23:32:19] <capisce> and I'm learning Estonian which is also a pain in the butt
[23:32:21] <two2thehead> gwern, yeah non-linear in a bad way
[23:33:18] <capisce> still prioritizing Chinese though
[23:33:32] <capisce> but some minutes of Russian on Duolingo each day doesn't hurt too much
[23:34:44] <capisce> not really sure what my goal is with Chinese, but it's interesting
[23:35:32] <capisce> I bought The Three-Body Problem trilogy in Chinese but still haven't tackled it
[23:36:14] <two2thehead> TRI SOLAR SICIGERY!
[23:36:23] <two2thehead> Or however the heck you spell it
[23:37:44] <gwern> szygzy?
[23:38:27] <saturn2> (who came up with that word?)
[23:38:57] <two2thehead> that's the one
[23:39:04] <capisce> "Among 80 young, overweight adults who reported sleeping for 6½ hours or less per night, those who slept for 1.2 hours (72 minutes) longer each night for two weeks consumed, on average, 270 fewer calories per day. Some ended up slashing up to 500 calories from their daily menus without even trying to "diet.""
[23:39:31] <two2thehead> whoever it was, he hated vowels
[23:39:58] <two2thehead> 'syzygy"
[23:41:04] <two2thehead> capisce, am I allowed to paste a quote from the book here? It's been years since it has come out so any spoiler policy doesn't apply imo
[23:41:42] <capisce> two2thehead: go ahead
[23:41:54] <capisce> spoilers never really bothered me anyway
[23:42:31] <gwern> capisce: one wonders how much is just that they had less time to snack themselves fat
[23:44:54] <capisce> not sure, I've noticed feeling hungrier on less sleep too
[23:45:17] <capisce> and the time when I was most successful at losing weight was when I was funemployed and could sleep ad libitum
[23:45:52] <capisce> but I was also staying in Vietnam for a significant time which has the lowest obesity rate in the world
