[01:20:46] <luke-jr> dale: (it's already authenticated)
[01:21:19] <dale> luke-jr: See above explanation from bjs: if you put {'a': 5} in locals, Python won't use it because it compiles the lambda before it knows a is a local, so it only looks for it in globals, which doesn't have a.
[01:21:28] <luke-jr> oh
[01:21:31] <Gustavo6046> Will mypyc eventually possibly implement special hot code for bytes/string handling? Would it be plausible?
[01:21:38] <luke-jr> even though the lambda in inside the eval?
[01:21:41] <luke-jr> which has 'a' as a local
[01:21:43] <dale> If you did "lambda a=a: a" it work, but that's hacky.
[01:21:57] <dale> luke-jr: Yes, as far as I understand.
[01:22:42] <bjs> luke-jr: Python reads your string as if it were a Python program.
[01:22:42] <luke-jr> but when it compiles lambda:a, it should already be a local :/

[01:22:51] <luke-jr> bjs: that's what I expect ;)
[01:23:05] <bjs> I'm not sure passing a "locals" when the input is a string ever does anything sensible(?)
[01:23:13] <Gustavo6046> Like if I wanna do operations on bytes, and some functions that are called a lot and seem to impact performance do many similar operations on byte sequences that could be made more efficient by using byte sequence manipulation more idiomatic to C at times, maybe mypyc could take advantage of that and very much optimize code that works with bytes a bunch!
[01:23:13] <bjs> luke-jr: okay but Python programs have globals, and then functions have locals
[01:23:29] <bjs> luke-jr: so you should expect "a" to be global in both.
[01:23:39] <Gustavo6046> Stuff like using char* arithmetic and grouping closely related operations on bytes objects happen in the same block of allocated memory

[01:25:37] <Gustavo6046> Not only does it help avoid context switching, if we're going to emit machine code from this e.g. using LLVM, being able to do string operation more contiguously (with less breaks inbetween for malloc or free or for managing data inbetween different allocated memory blocks) would make it more friendly to vectorizers and SIMD stuff.

[03:29:29] <JayDoubleu> yeah but the regex complexity might be a result of using pdfgrep tho, the examples I posted above are parsing this pdf for example https://github.com/cismirror/old-benchmarks-archive/blob/master/CIS_Amazon_Linux_2_Benchmark_v1.0.0.pdf and pdfgrep is making it ugly across multiple lines hence the ducktaped regex to make it work.
[03:30:36] <JayDoubleu> And to make it work it essentially finds all task headers like for example on page 20, extracts the header line for each task eg. 1.1.1.2, grabs it's Level and page number and adds it in YAML format

[06:37:06] <CodePoint> habnabit_: "...it's entirely unicode codepoint..."
[06:37:10] <Widdershins> habnabit_: 'symbol' is to me a pretty normal nomenclature for an identifier token
[06:37:30] <BrenBarn> so what are you asking exactly about `a` in that example?
[06:37:52] <Widdershins> BrenBarn: they're not, they're making an example of a symbol
[06:38:01] <gggp> I mean symbol of methods
[06:38:14] <habnabit_> Widdershins, sure but the implication here seems to be a set of desired features and that's going to depend on which language's "symbol" they mean
[06:38:20] <gggp> inheritance
[06:38:29] <habnabit_> Widdershins, like, objc selectors? ruby symbols? lisp symbols?
[06:38:36] <CodePoint> Widdershins: actually, it's more correctly referred to as a glyph.
[06:38:47] <Widdershins> habnabit_: yeah
[06:38:52] <CodePoint> symbol implies meaning.
[06:38:55] <Widdershins> CodePoint: glyphs and codepoints are very different
[06:39:02] <Widdershins> CodePoint: symbol does not imply meaning
[06:39:05] <BrenBarn> Widdershins: but before they were asking "how does a symbol work" or something

[06:39:20] <habnabit_> Widdershins, so knowing the origin tells you what the desired features are
[06:39:36] <habnabit_> Widdershins, not denying 'symbol' is a widely understood concept
[06:40:03] <habnabit_> js has symbols which are pretty weird
[06:40:10] <Widdershins> habnabit_: right. so i'm trying to remember the little nuances of javascript style prototype inheritance and honestly i don't remember any ways in which it's particularly different than python's class system
[06:40:29] <Widdershins> you can mostly just rename a couple concepts and it's *mostly* 1:1
[06:40:49] <habnabit_> in js a 'symbol' is really a specially-defined key for object methods like how C++ has special methods 'operator+' and so on
[06:40:54] <BrenBarn> Widdershins: um, yes, they asked "how does it lookup symbols"
[06:41:15] <CodePoint> habnabit_: actually they are referred to as member functions of the class.
[06:41:16] <habnabit_> so you concretely implement a protocol by making a method named one of those symbols instead of a string name
[06:41:21] <Widdershins> BrenBarn: in the context of resolving methods in nested inheritance. please calm down
[06:41:29] <Widdershins> BrenBarn: you did not read far enough back
[06:41:46] <habnabit_> gggp, are you asking about operator overloading like how you make an object iterable?
[06:42:13] <gggp> BrenBarn is right
[06:42:36] <nedbat> gggp: Python doesn't call them symbols, we just call them names.
[06:43:04] <Widdershins> habnabit_: i wasn't aware of any special semantics around particular names in javascript; i know the implementation has some special cases for efficiency and maybe i don't know enough about it but i'm not aware that it is that different semantically
[06:43:48] <BrenBarn> gggp: The way names are looked up is somewhat different if you're talking about a "bare" name (like `a` in your example) versus something like a method

[06:44:38] <BrenBarn> for a bare name it basically looks first in the local namespace, then in enclosing namespaces (like an enclosing function), eventually to the global namespace, and then finally the namespace of builtins

[06:53:01] <Widdershins> i think? actually hold on

[09:18:20] <Tashtari> But bash/sh is going to come up a lot if you work in *nix environments, so it wouldn't be bad to have a working knowledge of it
[09:18:20] <Samian> Tashtari  cool thanks!
[09:19:12] <bpalmer> If you're going to write bash code as a "professional, professional coder," the onus is on you to learn bash, at least so you know you're not introducing security issues or doing risky behavior.
[09:19:28] <bpalmer> but bash is not a tremendously complicated language.
[09:20:44] <Samian> One last question.  I type lscpu and the cluster I'm running benchmarks on shows 96 cpus.   I have atop running and python is at %1,000.   Running all 69 cpus would be %96,000, so I'm nowhere near that.   Is it safe to run two or three benchmarks in parallel?  Will python automatically pick cpus that aren't being utilized?

I've got a bunch of graphs that I'm updating and for the majority of the gui I create a thread when I need to do something somewhat processor intensive. Little did I know that only one thread was running at a time, so now I'm looking at multithreading or multiprocessing

[17:32:28] <con3> Currently I'm receiving data over serial, responding to the data and then using the received data to update indicators on the gui + update about 10 graphs.
[17:33:00] <con3>  I'm not sure however whether I should use multithreading/multiprocessing or the built-in qthreadpool for the graphs or if that is advised at all. My application also has two tabs. One showing received data, indicators and allowing you to send data via serial and the other for the graphs. When switching to the tab with the graphs there is noticeable decrease in performance

[18:37:59] <Marvin> before I was helped with this, I was using some cgi-bin stuff with nginx. quart was a tremendous imrpovement
[18:38:24] <jabberwock> I wouldn't say your direction was wrong. Definitely more complicated
[18:38:36] <Marvin> at least by a factor 10
[18:38:40] <jabberwock> grainger and grym seem to be on top of the latest and greatest tools :)

[18:39:32] <jabberwock> but you can also proxy from nginx to quart and use nginx as a load balancer. your experience was not without good learning
[18:40:23] <Marvin> from what I gathered here, the problem with was cgi, not quart. I was advised to (or advised not to, not sure anymore) fastcgi, stumbled on quart while trying to get it to work
[18:41:00] <Marvin> then moved to using Kivy because web forms and javascript are a real pain in the butt when dealing with binary strings
[18:41:05] <jabberwock> It seems like you want something that doesn't require a lot of fussing, and I would not recommend nginx or CGI for that
[18:41:24] <jabberwock> Kivy is the QT type thing?

[18:47:40] <Marvin> I don't see the need for templates. maybe for sites with a lot of static content but this is not where I'm going
[18:47:55] <jabberwock> did you mean dynamic?
[18:48:05] <jabberwock> what are you writing, out of curiosity? (if you're able to share)
[18:48:49] <Marvin> no, static. I'm writing a thing which is turning out to be some sort of tool for semantic analysis
[18:49:25] <jabberwock> that sounds really cool
[18:49:34] <Marvin> it can basically store any type of real-world objects parametrically into a single table
[18:49:51] <jabberwock> <- mind blown
[18:50:29] <Marvin> very recently I found out I was doing it wrong, and part of the thing is developping into a new form of "language" that is orthogonal to languages as we know them today
[18:51:07] <jabberwock> so it could potentially be used to write a better templating engine?
[18:51:12] <jabberwock> This is me pretending to understand
[18:51:27] <Marvin> using a single table has the advantage that you don't need to update the databasae structure or interface when adding/modifying objects
[18:51:51] <jabberwock> that makes sense, and is similar to dynamodb
[18:52:00] <Marvin> but I'm sure you know this. another advantage is that it makes it great for data correlation
[18:52:07] <SnoopJ> Marvin, in this context, templates are useful for decoupling static (as in always-there) content from dynamic (as in varies-per-request in general) content

[19:36:18] <SnoopJ> As an aside: you don't need to use os.path.join() here if you don't prefer it, you can call the .joinpath() method on Paths, use `Path(pth, "additional", "parts")`, or `pth / "additional" / "parts"` when you have Path objects

[21:20:56] <Jin^eLD> ammar2: been at that point a couple of times and not seldom then it was "too late" :)
[21:21:10] <habnabit_> Jin^eLD, (fwiw, this is a good example of how Python.h/cffi are the different spellings of the same concept: you can't do this with Python.h either. bytes objects have their own buffer that exists only in memory owned by the runtime)
[21:21:22] <SnoopJ> Jin^eLD, the middle-ground is making a prototype and measuring *that*
[21:21:57] <habnabit_> in either case, you can make an object that behaves like a bytes object would, but you can't make a builtin bytes object with a buffer it doesn't control
[21:22:02] <Jin^eLD> habnabit_: can you think of a python object that could be initialized with an existing memory buffer avoiding copying (still assuming/enforcing a read-only scenario)
[21:22:11] <SnoopJ> with a basic understanding of how the prototype does (or doesn't) represent the thing that will require a lot of build-out

[21:22:29] <habnabit_> Jin^eLD, sure, memoryview is the easiest one
[21:22:41] <Jin^eLD> cool thanks, will have a look at that
[21:23:05] <habnabit_> Jin^eLD, if this was something more interesting than ascii bytes, numpy can provide multiple-dimension arrays with weird strides
[21:23:13] <Jin^eLD> SnoopJ: you are not wrong, but one has to start somewhere :) if I had an easy out of the box way of not copying when I know I do not need copying, I'd rather go with that and then make my tests
[21:23:14] <habnabit_> Jin^eLD, but memoryview would be enough
[21:23:22] <ammar2> but again, I would suggest just doing the bytes approach first
[21:23:29] <Jin^eLD> nah, standard CAN is just 8 bytes payload
[21:23:31] <SnoopJ> Jin^eLD, I say it precisely because getting started is usually a good idea
[21:23:36] <ammar2> it's not that much work to switch it over to a memoryview if laid out correctly
[21:23:52] <habnabit_> 8 bytes? that isn't a copy; that's a single register move ;)

[21:25:36] <mike18> how can i make python unit test not to return exit 0 if a test fails?
[21:25:47] <habnabit_> mike18, use pytest; it can do that quite easily

[21:27:14] <SnoopJ> you use it like `pytest --cov=pkg/ ./tests/`
[21:27:28] <SnoopJ> mike18, it is unclear what the question "and coverage?" means here. Can you say more?
[21:27:45] <mike18> i have a test failing atm
[21:27:51] <mike18> but that coverage run -m pytest -sv ./tests/; coverage report

[21:28:07] <habnabit_> mike18, that's what ; does yes
[21:28:11] <habnabit_> mike18, perhaps you meant &&
[21:28:20] <SnoopJ> does coverage care about the exit code anyway?

[22:51:07] <phy1729> The pydantic docs have "validators are "class methods", so the first argument value they receive is the UserModel class, not an instance of UserModel."    I thought type['Foo'] was the right way to annotate that.
[22:52:04] *** Joins: wyclif (~wyclif@user/wyclif)
[22:52:49] <SnoopJ> phy1729, a simple string is by far the simplest way to do a forward reference of this sort. The behavior is defined by PEP 563 and referred to here: https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/postponed_annotations/#self-referencing-models
[22:53:40] <phy1729> But 'Foo' would mean an object of type Foo not an object which is the class Foo itself.
[22:55:18] <SnoopJ> hmm
[22:55:36] <SnoopJ> you're right, and I'm not sure why mypy doesn't complain when so-annotated
