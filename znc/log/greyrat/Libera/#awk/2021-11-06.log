[19:23:14] <shbot> emanuele6: etc... ( http://ix.io/3EcP )
[19:23:21] <nmz1> it works with just 2 $$
[19:23:31] <emanuele6> what?
[19:24:35] <emanuele6> # mawk 'BEGIN{print $"abc"}'
[19:24:36] <shbot> emanuele6: no output
[19:24:38] <emanuele6> # mawk 'BEGIN{print $$"abc"}'
[19:24:39] <shbot> emanuele6: no output
[19:24:43] <emanuele6> what does that do?
[19:24:56] <emanuele6> # echo line| mawk '{print $$"abc"}'
[19:24:56] <shbot> emanuele6: line
[19:25:01] <emanuele6> how?
[19:25:09] <emanuele6> oh, "abc" eveluates to 0
[19:25:31] <emanuele6> and then $0 is a string that evaluates to 0
[19:25:46] <emanuele6> but in user51's command it is 9999
[19:26:05] <emanuele6> then you have $9999 which is i don't know what
[19:26:23] <OMGOMG> # echo 9999 | mawk '{$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"abc" = 2; print}' | wc
[19:26:24] <shbot> OMGOMG:       1       1       2
[19:27:12] <emanuele6> $9999 is "", then $"" is $0 which is 9999, then $9999 is "" ...
[19:27:38] <emanuele6> so that is basically setting $9999 = 2
[19:28:43] <emanuele6> # echo 9999 | mawk '{$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"abc" = 2; print}' | awk 'END { print substr($0,length-2) }'
[19:28:43] <shbot> emanuele6: 2
[19:28:46] <emanuele6> yes
[19:29:17] <emanuele6> # echo 9999 | mawk '{$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"abc" = 2; print}' | awk 'END { print "last two chars: _"substr($0,length-2)"_" }'
[19:29:17] <shbot> emanuele6: last two chars: _2_
[19:29:29] <emanuele6> ah, right -2 is just the last character
[19:29:58] <emanuele6> anyway, that is what that does: $($0) = 2; print

[20:55:35] <user51> nmz1: you need to rubber duck the $ operator to get it

[20:57:27] <user51> uh, sorry, bad explanation
[20:57:44] <user51> $N would mean "take the nth field, access it"
[20:58:30] <user51> so $($N) would access the $N field

[21:11:18] <cyberbanjo> can awk set enviornment variables? see the time of every timezone but idk how to use awk $ timedatectl list-timezones | awk 'system("env TZ=$0 date")'
[21:11:58] <emanuele6> that is not valid awk
[21:12:35] <emanuele6> what you want is: awk '{ system("TZ="$0" date") }'
[21:12:51] <emanuele6> env is not necessary because system runs the program with /bin/sh
[21:13:20] <cyberbanjo> Thank you, that is what I needed. :) 
[21:13:36] <emanuele6> but you should quote $0 properly before injecting sh to avoid problems
[21:14:32] <emanuele6> since the output of `timedatectl list-timezones' is just timezones, it should not matter
[21:14:44] <emanuele6> but it's not hard to do
[21:14:57] <emanuele6> cyberbanjo: anyway, why do you want to use awk for this?
[21:15:07] <cyberbanjo> What would you normally use? 
[21:15:13] <emanuele6> sh
[21:15:35] <emanuele6> timedatectl list-timezones | while read -r tz; do TZ=$tz date; done
[21:15:46] <emanuele6> that is safe by default
[21:16:37] <cyberbanjo> i dont really know sh, but thats anticipating more input
[21:16:40] <earnestly> emanuele6: zdump
[21:17:15] <emanuele6> in awk, to make it safe you would have to do something like this: awk '{ gsub(/'/,"'\\''"); system("TZ='"$0"' date") }'
[21:17:32] <emanuele6> and it is unnecessarily hacky
[21:17:34] <earnestly> More backslashes I'm afraid
[21:17:43] <emanuele6> ah, right.
[21:18:09] <earnestly> emanuele6: I've done this recently, it's unfun:         gsub("'\''", "'\'\\\\\'\''", shellsafe); system("mkdir -p -- '\''" shellsafe "'\''")
[21:18:30] <emanuele6> > thats anticipating more input
[21:18:39] <emanuele6> cyberbanjo: what does that mean?
