[03:04:36] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> thanks for the insight
[03:04:43] <A-KO> hurdygurdy: By having the key physically stored in an HSM, where key operations are offloaded via PKCS#11 operations that occur over the wire on the HSM itself.
[03:05:00] <A-KO> where the CA itself, does not, at all, have the key anywhere near it. Not in memory, not on disk, etc.
[03:05:08] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> ah
[03:05:47] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> So... the better stack would be Vault for secrets and shit, and then an external CA that can appauth with Vault?
[03:06:06] <A-KO> no. Vault doesn't handle PKI very well at all.
[03:06:13] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> oh
[03:06:27] <A-KO> vault can, however, use an HSM to protect its secrets via sign + seal. ; so the best option is an external HSM that both vault and CAs can use

[07:30:40] <a1> ^

[07:30:59] <Cl0udNinja> only serial killers use /bin/sh
[07:31:29] <Cl0udNinja> a1, yes, but I didnt initially for this one. I broke it into sub tasks that are ina role, but not really using a role in itself. tbh I dislike the role process/structure in ansible
[07:31:36] <catbeard> gcc developers and serial killers
[07:31:43] <Cl0udNinja> I much prefer the role structure from Chef
[07:31:58] <a1> Cl0udNinja: roles are ok to me. i am not a fan of some of the conditionals
[07:32:01] <catbeard> probably one and the same

[07:32:30] <Cl0udNinja> a1, yeah thats my issue with it. thats why I liked the Chef roles much more. 'include role:subrole'
[07:32:39] <Cl0udNinja> well thats not quite it but you get my point
[07:32:53] <a1> kind of, personally haven't used chef
[07:33:04] <a1> i get the concept though
[07:33:07] <catbeard> HELLO CHILDREN
[07:33:16] <Cl0udNinja> Hurdy I'd suggest Chef over puppet, but only partially. Puppet sucks imo, but Chef has taken a weird turn in their methodology/distribution

[19:31:36] <thegodsquirrel> oh noes
[19:33:39] <thegodsquirrel> csws I have only used VMWare back in my MSP days, my shop was all Windows and when we got a new client with VMware we converted them to Hyper-V
[19:34:14] <csws> geez
[19:34:31] <thegodsquirrel> It seems to have everything I am looking for, mostly want to get experience with terraform and ansible for fun
[19:34:34] <csws> if you sign up for vmware.com I think you can get trials and whatnot
[19:34:55] <thegodsquirrel> Yeah, that's how I got esxi 7.0

[19:35:41] <DrZak> huh?
[19:35:54] <DrZak> so, to install it you need to get the SSD somewhere else and put stuff on it?
[19:35:55] <thegodsquirrel> That's why I was considering ProxMox because I run Debian for my Docker stuff 
[19:36:06] <thegodsquirrel> I dont Haise
[19:36:12] <csws> @Haise my greasy fingers already slipped and hit ctrl+v so thegodsquirrel is sorted
[19:36:13] <sd> 09<H​aise> ok
[19:36:27] <DrZak> or boot something else from usb, the dump the esxi image on it and then boot thtat?
[19:36:30] <sd> 09<H​aise> thegodsquirrel: give me couple of mins and I will get on IRC

[19:37:00] <DrZak> oooh
[19:37:04] <DrZak> so the installer WILL boot
[19:37:12] <DrZak> just hte hypervisor wont

[19:37:32] <thegodsquirrel> You can use Balena or Rufus 
[19:37:33] <csws> step 2: launch rufus
[19:37:58] <DrZak> does os-x still require fink to actually do anything that isnt a toy?
