[09:31:21] <sdragon> Digit: why's that?
[09:35:31] <Digit> it often has a sorta music-disrespecting/time-signature-disrespecting way.
[09:36:46] <Digit> sometimes dizzying sliding asynchronicities of parts, sometimes jarring changes.
[09:37:51] <sdragon> I can appreciate that sort of stuff, if I'm in the right mood
[09:38:01] <sdragon> I enjoy Captain Beefheart
[09:38:02] <Digit> "waltz right into my space when I'm listening to music in 4/4" made me think how fitting a cartoon-characterisation that could be of what soffmi muhod often does.  :)
[09:38:49] <Digit> yeah.  similar spirit, in parts, albeit genre-askew.   ... whatever genre soffmi muhod is.   but then captain beefheart wasnt particularly genre constrained either.  :)
[09:39:23] <sdragon> CB is very blues, I think
[09:39:41] <sdragon> Just very raw, unrestrained blues
[09:40:12] <Digit> :) broad churchly, yeah, and so where cb's blues, sm's experimental.
[09:40:41] <sdragon> I can dig it, Digit

[09:46:21] <Digit> om nom junk-food music.  so much sugar.  energy happy buzz.  :D
[09:47:34] <sdragon> Funny you say that, as I bite into actual junk food, and for just that reason
[09:49:15] <Digit> i like to think there's less substance to any side-effect harms of audio-junk than "food", but who knows.   
[09:49:58] <sdragon> You could be right
[09:50:58] <Digit> i had to switch one off yesterday upon hearing what sounded like authoritarian/supremacist hypnotic suggestions... :3  makes one crave purely instrumental... so one doesnt need have the media-astute propaganda-aware mental-tinfoil guard up.
[09:52:06] <sdragon> There's always Rage Against the Machine
[09:52:25] * Digit musics more for parasympathetic-mode healing... most of the time
[09:52:36] <Digit> yeah, the cathartic go-to #1
[09:53:26] <Digit> soffmi muhod's ominator's sorta between both.  n_n  rage, om,    ... and the machine.
[09:54:22] <Digit> autechre sometimes too.    :)   mix of cathartic rage, and om,  ... and the machine.  :D

[20:50:54] <artao> earlier i was fantasizing that the russian military would turn and join with ukraine to go take putin out of power
[20:51:40] <Panther> You can't turn the clock back; it only goes forward. Maybe you could reassemble the Soviet Union, but it is never going to happen by killing your 'comrades.'
[20:52:49] <Panther> Clearly he has not thought enough about this issue. Further, if he does start a nuclear war, it won't matter anymore, anyway.
[20:54:37] <Panther> Besides... what ever happened to the tough russkies? Did they lose something since the '40s? Now they can't fight, but have to hide behind a nuclear weapon. They never went toe to toe with the Americans, so... put that button down, and let's see what you really got. :P

[20:57:01] <morf> well that's what i understand from their propaganda shit and what i think anyway

[20:57:40] <Panther> Russia has a lot to offer. Maybe it could be done, tho I am sure no one there will want the kind of government they used to have. It takes imagination and creativity to do something like that.

[22:48:36] <LibertyDillo> I sure don't want one, although I'd consider a hybrid
[22:48:51] <louipx> i'd have an electric sure
[22:49:06] <R2robot> An electric truck is definitely on my wishlist
[22:49:07] <louipx> i still want the diesel truck tho to go with it ;)
[22:49:46] <R2robot> electrics make full torque off idle.  
[22:50:00] <louipx> until theres nuclear powered vehicles
[22:50:04] <louipx> then i'll go for that 100%

[23:49:23] <nativetexan> howdy LibertyDillo, yes sir it's really nice outside
[23:49:40] <artao> JFC, me. That couldn't have been healthy. I just ate an entire 10oz bag of fresh cheese curds and an entire 1lb package of fake crab. I just couldn't stop cramming it in my mouth.

[23:53:10] <artao> Anyone know what the status is of Russia's Northern Fleet?
[23:53:45] <nativetexan> not i, i've been reading about what's happening
[23:55:41] <nativetexan> seems the media is spinning this invasion/war into overtime 
[23:57:32] <nativetexan> we will probably have to wait like 20 years before the truth comes out
[23:58:58] <efex_> look at global media to bypass your local political “fake news” issue
[23:59:17] <nativetexan> like which global media?
[23:59:35] <efex_> all of it
[23:59:51] <efex_> for example the Manchester Guardian..  established 1821
