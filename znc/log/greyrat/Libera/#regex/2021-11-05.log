[00:58:01] <ChrisM> Quick question... can I use \L to only transform the capture group directly after it without affecting other capture groups when doing a substituion? https://regex101.com/r/cOkKQI/1/
[00:58:28] <ChrisM> I want the result after substitution to be skillName for both lines
[00:58:34] <ChrisM> Instead of skillname
[01:01:04] <ChrisM> Or is there a way to pull this off without using a Transformation
[01:01:14] <VectorX> ChrisM you can add \E where you want it to stop
[01:01:28] <ChrisM> Nice thanks!
[01:02:01] <ChrisM> Is there a way to achieve the same result without using a Transformation?
[01:03:28] <ChrisM> Just noticed that VSCode does not handle Transformations in the replace field correctly
[01:04:18] <ChrisM> Turns it into s\EkillName lol
[01:04:50] <ChrisM> Acutally it apparently is fine with the Transformation but not the \E

[01:08:39] <re101-kiwi-22> does anyone have any ideas about the question I asked at the beginning of the chat?
[01:10:56] <VectorX> re101-kiwi-22 how do you renumber it?

[01:11:16] <ChrisM> :')
[01:12:53] <VectorX> if you need to paste any code or exampled you can paste into your regex101 link or use https://pastebin.com/ , you kept getting muted for pasting a lot of text in here
[01:14:33] <ChrisM> I highly recommend regex101
[01:15:25] <re101-kiwi-22> Yeah, I didn't know how to use the site, but I corrected that and the regex101 link is up at the top of this chat
[01:15:32] <re101-kiwi-22> sorry...
[01:16:59] <VectorX> you had started to paste some urls and code, we didnt see all of it, so update the link with what ever you want us to look at and tell us how the rules of how it needs to get renumberd, beside regex not able to do that
[01:26:19] <re101-kiwi-22> Sorry, I just clicked on the link above and it takes me to the example I was working on...
[01:26:23] <re101-kiwi-22> https://regex101.com/r/8HuvYj/1
[01:26:52] <VectorX> yeah it's not going to update by itself, you have to put stuff in there and hit the update button, and give us the new link
[01:27:31] <re101-kiwi-22> The list numbering is not consistent. I just want to find a way to renumber the list so that it is consistent, i.e. 1 2 3 4 5, etc.
[01:28:22] <re101-kiwi-22> However, the amount of URLs the user may add is unknown...
[01:28:55] <re101-kiwi-22> therefore the REGEX needs to work for at least 4 digit numbers?
[01:29:35] <VectorX> you would have to do that with vb, if the text is one entire string, split it into lines, then you can go two ways, loop thru the lines and replace the number with a counter value starting at 1, probably the easiest, or split by ; again and loop thru doing somthing similar
[01:30:15] <VectorX> if you need to match the number with regex for the replacement you can do something like ^\d+

[01:31:14] <re101-kiwi-22> Not really understanding your questions VectorX?
[01:31:36] <VectorX> I didnt ask any questions
[01:31:44] <re101-kiwi-22> I just clicked on the link and both links take me directly to my example?
[01:32:09] <re101-kiwi-22> My example is a list where each line is numbered
[01:32:20] <VectorX> I just told you what you need to do
[01:32:23] <re101-kiwi-22> but the numbering became inconsistent
[01:33:00] <VectorX> this is assuming the list is sequential but numbers are not based on what you said so far
[01:33:01] <re101-kiwi-22> I would like to find a way to add, remove, correct the numbering...
[01:33:43] <re101-kiwi-22> the expression ([\d+]) is what I used in my example...
[01:33:56] <VectorX> you need ^\d+
[01:34:10] <re101-kiwi-22> But that neither removes nor corrects the numbering...
[01:34:43] <re101-kiwi-22> ^\d+ only selects the numbers...
[01:34:46] <VectorX> regex cannot do that, it can remove the number with a replace but you have to add it back to the string using VB, I explained that above
[01:36:18] <re101-kiwi-22> so what do I need to do to remove the numbers from all the lines in the list?
[01:38:04] <VectorX> split the lines by \n or \n\r depending what you have, then loop the lines and do a Regex.Replace() matching ^\d+ and replace with empty string, use a counter variable and increment it in the loop then add that counter to the start of the string

[02:06:58] <VectorX> re101-kiwi-22 actually one ammendment to what I said, instead of replacing by an empty string, you can use the counter value

[06:12:46] <ChrisM> Anybody know why my substitution is not working correctly? https://regex101.com/r/loxTPn/6/ The results I get in regex101 under substitution is exactly what I want it to be.
[06:13:38] <ChrisM> I tried doing the substitution in VSCode and it worked until a certain point and then just started returning numbers
[06:14:05] <ChrisM> I also tried using a PHP script to do the substitution and it did absolutely nothing.
[06:17:46] <JohnDoe2> ChrisM that sounds like you're trying to make an all-in-one code parser
[06:19:22] <JohnDoe2> ChrisM I'd recommend having a look at CodeMirror - make a custom mode. You can then replace text or change its case, whatever. If that sounds like a lot, then I would emulate a parser by going at it chunk by chunk. In other words rather than 1 regex, make 1 regex per task.
[06:20:57] <ChrisM> Thanks I will try it out
[06:22:15] <JohnDoe2> yeah that's an insane regex I'm afraid I don't have the kind of time on my hand to figure out what all 160+ capture groups do. It's definitely a good example of things getting out of hand.
[06:22:18] <ChrisM> Are you saying that you think it is all the \l that is breaking it?
[06:22:32] <ChrisM> Yeah I get that
[06:22:43] <ChrisM> Things always seem to get out of hand with me lol
[06:23:18] <JohnDoe2> ChrisM well if it works in regex101, then it's fine, that's where it exists.
[06:23:34] <JohnDoe2> but taking \l to vscode won't work.
[06:23:45] <ChrisM> It does work in VSCode though
[06:23:56] <ChrisM> I was using it without a problem earlier today
[06:24:01] <JohnDoe2> taking it to php requires you to run preg_replace_callback() and pass it a callback function to do the lowercase transformation
[06:24:53] <ChrisM> Think I will try removing all of them and then just changing the case everywhere afterward
[06:24:53] <JohnDoe2> ChrisM cool, yeah it seems to be implemented there.
[06:25:07] <ChrisM> Maybee there are just too many of them lol
[06:25:20] <JohnDoe2> either way that's not what I'm saying and I have no clue what you mean by "not working correctly"
[06:25:41] <JohnDoe2> getting the answer to that would require me to look at the monster 😆
[06:27:01] <ChrisM> (y)
[06:30:02] <JohnDoe2> ChrisM if you look at your changes side-by-side they're not that extensive, it's a bit overengineered 
[06:30:34] <JohnDoe2> 1: abilityThreeTargetTypes -> targetType
[06:30:42] <JohnDoe2> 2: abilityThreeNumHits -> numHits
[06:31:00] <JohnDoe2> 3: abilityThreeSkillDescs -> skillDesc
[06:31:12] <JohnDoe2> see a pattern yet?
[06:32:21] <ChrisM> Yeah I forget why I felt this was the way I had to do it
[06:35:48] <ChrisM> Same issue without the \l's I think your right I need to just do a bunch of simple replacements
[06:36:47] <JohnDoe2> one thing at a time
[06:37:07] <ChrisM> Thanks for setting me straight =)
[06:38:32] <JohnDoe2> ChrisM https://regex101.com/r/loxTPn/7 to start you off, the items you're making singular, except NumHits which stays plural
[06:39:00] <JohnDoe2> ChrisM a useful tool would be a visual diff software. For example Meld, or some vscode extension I don't know about 
[06:39:04] <ChrisM> Correct
[06:39:19] <ChrisM> Cool, thanks again
[06:40:00] <JohnDoe2> that helps you "see" only what's changed between your original and where you want to get. Then it's a matter of seeing a pattern and simplifying regex's job. Try to be as precise as possible to avoid false positives
