[00:34:36] <mooff> shame there isn't an obvious canonical way to serialize a channel in the sidebar to a URL fragment other than its position
[00:34:44] <mooff> like #/chan-16 etc
[00:36:48] <bookworm> (it's not the position in your sidebar but the channel ID)
[00:37:49] <bookworm> the problem with human readable URLs is how do you construct them? Max tried with the hostname+chan combo, that immediately fails if you use any sort of bouncer
[00:38:43] <MaxLeiter> (I still want to merge that in, at least for public mode. Would be great for conferences) 
[00:39:03] <bookworm> or if you have multiple connections to the same network, which isn't that unusual
[00:44:47] <Activ8> Unless you could add a tag to the channel and use that tag for non bouncer scenarios 
[00:44:51] <Activ8> dunno
[00:46:27] <Activ8> Iâ€™m using 4.3 master and I thought you could swipe from right for user list? It doesnâ€™t work on an iPhone I donâ€™t think
[00:47:57] <MaxLeiter> Not merged, author hasnt completed the PR 
[00:48:11] <MaxLeiter> shouldnt be terribly difficult to fix up if anyone has interest
[00:48:34] <MaxLeiter> (Probably just re using the channel list code) 
[00:49:59] <Activ8> Ah that explains it

[00:55:29] <rvgate> hey guys, while experimenting with thelounge using docker i realised i never used a volume mount for my running container. to migrate the data, would it be as easy as copying everything from /var/opt/thelounge to the volume mount and restart?

[17:20:18] <onichomp> is there a way to delay a command? 
[17:21:15] <onichomp> like... when i join a server, i need to msg a bot to get permission to access a channel, but the bot doesn't give the permission right away it takes some seconds
[17:24:39] <xnaas> I don't think there's anything like a /sleep or /wait, but you could do some random stuff like /ns HELP or something just to waste time. ðŸ¤”
[17:25:46] <onichomp> ok, it's very hacky, but thanks
[17:26:22] <bookworm> the very hacky part is delaying in the first place
[17:26:43] <bookworm> sleeping is not a valid synchronization primitive mkey
[17:27:49] <onichomp> so, it's hard to implement it in a client?
[17:28:08] <bookworm> sleep? No, trivial
[17:28:51] <xnaas> Hmm...maybe there was a /sleep -- I feel like I remember using it in the past, but maybe not. 
[17:30:00] <onichomp> so, it's trivial but not a feature? mmm... 
[17:31:23] <onichomp> this feature exists on mirc https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/mirc/commands/timer
