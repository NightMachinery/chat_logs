[02:40:39] <sney> !pmount
[02:40:39] <dpkg> pmount ("policy mount") is an application to make it easier to (un)mount removable media such as USB flash memory sticks; e.g. as normal user, "pmount sda1" mounts it at /media/sda1 (no superuser requirement, no need to create a mount point).  You will need to be in the <plugdev> group, but you'll know that from reading /usr/share/doc/pmount/README.Debian.

[03:07:06] <gry> whats wrong with it?
[03:07:32] <Katana_Steel> chromium was updated upstream, about a week ago and still no change on the tracker page
[03:08:08] <sney> Katana_Steel: yes, new sid uploads are rare during the freeze 
[03:08:37] <sney> and the chromium package is big and can be complicated to upgrade. 
[03:08:47] <sney> !slushy
[03:08:47] <dpkg> When a <testing> release becomes frozen, <unstable> tends to partially freeze as well.

[09:56:01] <jhutchins> Just curious, and if so how have you managed to avoid docker.
[09:57:17] <joze> ápt distupgrade will leave manual added sources as they are when the grat upgrade comes?
[09:58:04] <PMT> My prior job in primarily sysadminning was pre-Docker, my next job was almost exclusively software eng, my current job is a weird mix and my employer has a lot of homegrown solutions
[09:58:44] <joze> I never did a dist upgrade
[09:58:58] <joze> frightening
[10:00:05] <PMT> joze: "apt dist-upgrade" will not, I believe, mess with your sources.list{,.d} contents at all, but packages installed outside of the main Debian repos may not function on newer releases than intended, and in the worst case could conceivably break the upgrade
[10:00:23] <joze> is there something new that will not be enabled when I dist upgrade instead of a fresh install?
[10:01:47] <PMT> The release notes should document any major things to be aware of, but generally I would expect settings to be preserved, so you might indeed end up with an older default preserved.
[10:02:21] <joze> so fresh install it will be
[10:02:45] <PMT> fresh install would have the new settings, yes, but if you find a setting that isn't what you want it to be, you can change it.
[10:02:58] <PMT> *new defaults, I should say.
[10:03:10] <joze> I wanted to be lazy
[10:05:52] *** Joins: mason (~mason@redhat/mason)
[10:06:18] <PMT> If a changed setting is somehow earth-shattering, I'd expect a popup on upgrade or in the release notes or something.
[10:06:43] <joze> maybe!
[10:10:39] <PMT> If you're worried about your data somehow being lost on upgrade, make sure you have a known-good up-to-date backup (or, ideally, backups, but that's a separate discussion). If you're worried about the system not booting properly after the upgrade, that would be a somewhat surprising outcome, but almost certainly recoverable as long as you can boot something from USB or CD and have a livecd/liveusb/... handy. 
[10:10:45] <PMT> If you're worried about something else, ...
[10:11:28] <PMT> I've dist-upgraded this machine 3 times, I think, and I'm not especially concerned about going to bullseye whenever I do that. YMMV, of course, depending on your concerns, experiences, and backup state, but that's my $0.02.
[10:11:59] <joze> the usual ways to do upgrades were always fresh installs
[10:12:13] <mason> Debian's been safe for in-place upgrades for many years now.
[10:12:22] <joze> I am too old for this!
[10:12:34] <mason> If you're an enterprise, then sure, upgrade hardware and software together on a schedule.
[10:12:36] <PMT> Which systems were you using, that fresh installs were the preferred upgrade route?
[10:12:47] <mason> PMT: They still are depending on the environment.

[10:13:46] <joze> the configurations of the default
[10:14:38] <PMT> If you want a system with all the same settings as a new install, then you probably want a new install.
[10:14:58] <joze> yeah, silly me

[10:19:49] <PMT> I too think that it would be better to look at the new config files for the packages you're having FOMO on, rather than just replacing the install, unless you absolutely need to for whatever reason. Not that there's anything wrong with a fresh install, but having to redo everything in your setup is often involved.

[12:41:13] <angkat> googling for ntpd shows that you have to install it, but i don't know about systemd
[12:42:09] <jaafarrc> Ah, classic systemd.
[12:42:32] <ratrace> if you mean that in some bad way, the reason it's enabled by default is because the maintainer said so

[12:42:51] <angkat> maybe this will help ^
[12:42:59] <ratrace> it's in the vendor presets file which is entirely distro/maintainer configurable. the unit also has a condition to not start if another ntp daemon binary is present

[13:00:07] <auge> or wouldnt I?
[13:00:33] <ratrace> afaik, could be wrong, grub-pc is terrible with windows 10 in dual boot as win10 constantly wants to fix its booting chain
[13:00:56] <auge> ive been like that for long. no issues
[13:01:01] <ratrace> because ordinarily, you'd need grub to be the main component in boot chain, which then offloads to windows stageN loaders

[13:02:10] <ratrace> auge: okay, so, in that context.... is {/usr}/sbin/grub-install not present on debian live?
[13:02:20] <auge> no its not
[13:02:42] <ratrace> I don't recall, can you apt install on live?
[13:02:53] <auge> yeah, but cant find it in repositories O.o
[13:02:58] <ratrace> grub-pc
[13:03:13] <PMT> it's grub2-common on my buster system, according to dpkg -S.
[13:03:19] <auge> i even downloaded an udeb package, but couldnt install because dependancy, then i try install dependency libc6 cant find it also
[13:03:38] <auge> uhm
[13:03:46] <ratrace> PMT: grub-pc should be the "main" package that then pulls in common and stuff, because you can differentiate grub-pc from grub-efi
[13:04:26] <auge> btw, i can install grub on any of my drives, right? i want to install it in /dev/sdd
[13:04:30] <auge> where my linux are
[13:04:58] <ratrace> auge: sure, as long as the drive ahs the conditions for a staged bootloader

[13:05:38] <auge> installed
[13:06:13] <auge> grub-install: error: failed to get canonical path of `overlay'.
[13:06:15] <PMT> auge: honestly it sounds like your problem is that your boot order put the windows drive higher than your linux drive, if it's defaulting to windows and you didn't have the drive where GRUB was installed plugged in when you did the windows install. So I'd double-check that.
[13:06:30] <ratrace> that's a possibility
[13:06:37] <auge> PMT in my motherboard i can choose what drive to boot
[13:06:45] <auge> but ive tried all my drives and cant find the grub
[13:06:58] <auge> i think i installed the grub on the same drive i formatted 
[13:07:10] <PMT> that would also certainly cause this.
[13:07:14] <auge> i did this long ago and cant remember
[13:07:32] <ratrace> multiple-drive dualbooting is the best you can do, they _should_ be totally independent, and windows _usually_ won't touch other drives like that
[13:08:04] <auge> uhm, how is that?
[13:08:13] <auge> like, choosing in the MOTHERBOARD which drive to boot?
[13:08:39] <auge> i would like to keep that, but there is a issue, i cant boot my linux now. I dont know why
[13:08:59] <auge> since grub is messed, i try to boot linux drive from motherboard, but black screen is there, debian wont boot anymore
[13:09:05] <PMT> I think it may have stopped, but didn't Windows used to have a nasty habit of just scribbling its bootloader on every drive visible if you, say, ran fixboot?
[13:09:13] <auge> maybe it doesnt know whats the partition now that i removed grub?
[13:11:03] <auge> PMT that never be my case. Windows never screwed my grub until now. well if you try to fix boot from windows, it will probably ruin your grub, but i never did that
[13:11:16] <auge> same way, if you install windows, it will screw your grub, thats what happened to me
[13:11:29] <auge> but the problem is, i think the grub was installed in the same drive i installed windows
[13:11:40] <auge> so this time i want to install it where the linux is
[13:12:28] <PMT> auge: I wasn't commenting on your specific situation, just remarking that I thought Windows had a bad habit of scribbling over the bootloader on every drive it could see whenever it had occasion to write it (which is, admittedly, almost never).
[13:14:20] <auge> you think what im trying to do is right? installing grub in my linux drive?
[13:14:30] <auge> im getting an error, cant find cannonical overlay

[13:21:33] <auge> there are 4 ext 4 partitions, and 1 swap, and one partition without defined FS
[13:22:04] <PMT> The big clue, I would think, would be which one is the largest, unless you configured it pretty strangely.
[13:22:08] <ratrace> if you don't use labels, mount one by one and see what's on them. maybe nice opportunity to put on some labels, if only partlabels (which I prefer over fs labels)

[23:17:10] <search_social> Hello, I have a list of some dates from Linux kernel history and some overlapping dates from Debian distro history. I would like to generate a timeline image stitching both sets of dates on one axis but keeping them separate on the other axis. I'm wondering what libre software would do this.
