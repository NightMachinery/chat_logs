[11:17:41] <byteit101[m]> I often have a desire to quickly load a jruby session with certain maven artifacts loaded. it's always a pain to create artifacts so finally got around to creating a maven_require that does just that. This seems like thing that may be useful to more than just me, so was looking at where to put it. I see the jar-dependencies gem has similar things, and I depend on that, so my thoughts are: I could make a new gem, or would jar-dependencies
[11:17:41] <byteit101[m]> want to integrated my method?
[13:42:06] <kares[m]> JarDependencies already has that - did you try smt like: `require_jar 'org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.12.0'`
