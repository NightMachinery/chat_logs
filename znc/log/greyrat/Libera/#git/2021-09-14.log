[02:21:23] <foo> Trying to push a repo to github. I want to use a specific ed25519 key. I have a .ssh/config set up for my preference, Host me, Hostname github.com, User git, Port 22, IdentityFile... I do git add origin me:myuser/myreponame.git  , git push -u origin main ... but I'm getting a permission denied. fatal: Could not read from remote repository. -> any suggestions?
[02:21:55] <foo> Or if nothing more, perhaps someone can confirm I'm doing the git part right?
[02:24:20] <mackerman> foo: If you have ssh set up, you can test ssh to github without  git   https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection
[02:25:16] <foo> mackerman: thanks, denied. Which likely tells me it's not repo specific and as a whole my key doesn't work, correct?
[02:25:32] <mackerman> That origin repo you described does not have a github URL. Unless you are obfuscating things.
[02:26:02] <foo> mackerman: I am, it's a private repo so I don't think it'd work anywho. It's starting to sound like my key isn't set up in github although I thought I did this
[02:26:05] <mackerman> Likely either you or github is not configured for that key, correct.

[15:07:25] <tsdh> I'm just doing a "git merge origin/branch" and notice that this merges commits which I've already merged yesterday.  But on my current branch's log they have different SHAs.  Seems like someone force-pushed origin/branch?  How can I find out?
[15:09:29] <bookworm> look at your graph? if you merge origin/branch into your local one it should always be a fast forward
[15:10:10] <bookworm> (assuming it's the same remote tracking branch, naturally)
[15:10:17] <tsdh> bookworm: No, I'm merging origin/release-X into release-Y so it's never a fast-forward.
[15:13:15] <tsdh> But I can see that a commit no origin/release-X I've merged yesterday has a different SHA in my release-Y log (at one arm of my merge commit) than in the current origin/release-X log, so it seems that commit (and some of its predecessors) where changed on the origin/release-X branch.  That should not have happened and I wonder if I can find out who it was.
[15:14:49] <tsdh> Oh, well, that has to be the committer of the oldest commit from release-X which is still included in this merge, right?
[15:16:17] <gnoo> will git show `sha' work?

[15:38:17] <ikke> there are 2 ways:

[18:51:45] <imMute> what version of git do you have?  it definitely removes the {a => b} (and replaces it with two separate lines) for me
[18:52:18] <Rashad> Hello. I initialized an empty repo in my folder. I have a .gitignore that looks like this: `*.out`. I want to do a `git clean` before I add things to the repo.
[18:53:08] <Rashad> However, I also wanted to do a `git clean -n` (dry run) for a .gitignore `!*.java`, just to make sure there isn't something else I need to be cleaning.
[18:53:35] *** Quits: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[18:53:43] <imMute> Rashad: you can add gitignore patterns to git-clean with the -e flag, if that's what you're looking for
[18:53:46] <Rashad> (I am simplifying the .gitignore file to be brief)
[18:53:55] <humky> imMute: 2.33.0
[18:54:24] <Rashad> imMute: If I run `git clean -n` with .gitignore=`*.out` , it will list all the *.out files
[18:54:43] *** Joins: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel)
[18:54:57] <imMute> Rashad: makes sense, I believe it lists the files it would remove
[18:54:59] <Rashad> imMute: If I run `git clean -n` with gitignore=`!*.java`, it doesn't list anything
[18:55:26] <imMute> Rashad: makes sense, you're telling it *not* to remove .java files
[18:55:27] <Rashad> I even tried `!x` which should list everything except for x
[18:55:37] <imMute> no no no,  that's not what ! means
[18:55:53] <imMute> it means "don't ignore this file" not "ignore everything *but* this file"
[18:55:53] *** Quits: eschwartz (~eschwartz@archlinux/bugwrangler/eschwartz) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[18:56:06] <Rashad> oh I see I see
[18:56:20] <imMute> it's so you can have stuff like   'somedir/*' and '!somedir/*.java'  which causes git to ignore everything in the dir except the java files
[18:56:24] <Rashad> Is there an option to ignore everything but a certain pattern?
[18:56:46] <imMute> Yes, add "*" to your gitignore.  might need something like "**/*" too but the first one might be enough.
[18:57:03] <Rashad> I see I see
[18:57:05] <imMute> and then add "!*.java", for example, to not ignore the java files.
[18:57:14] <Rashad> Yeah
[18:57:17] <Rashad> Let me try.
[18:57:21] *** Joins: eschwartz (~eschwartz@archlinux/bugwrangler/eschwartz)
[18:57:27] <imMute> but that's an atypical use of gitignore.  it's usually better to ignore just the things you actually want to ignore
[18:57:47] <mspe> be careful
[18:57:52] <imMute> because with "ignore everything by default" you might create a new file that *should* be tracked, but it doesn't show up in status because it's ignored and now you've not committed it.
[18:57:58] <Rashad> yeah I am just doing this to "inspect" my code... the final gitignore will be much different

[23:09:58] <James0r> so looking at this, you can't discern which branches were merged right?
[23:10:17] <ikke> James0r: no, plain log just linearizes everything
[23:10:54] <imMute> James0r: my go-to is   git log --graph --oneline --decorate=short   (and some other things)
[23:10:54] <ikke> James0r: you could also use --format=fuller, which shows the parents of each commit

[23:13:12] <James0r> what's in the parenthesis to the right of the commit and commit hash is showing which branches are on the same pointer? maybe pointer isn't the right word

[23:40:04] <imMute> James0r: did you 'git fetch' ?
[23:40:33] <imMute> James0r: "showing which branches are on the same pointer?"  more like showing which branches point to which commits (and the ones on the same line all point to the same commit)
[23:40:56] *** Quits: Strom (strom@fedora/strom) ()
[23:41:19] <haymawk> I got a warning in a pull request that the branches have multiple merge bases. I'm assuming something like this happened. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26370185/how-do-criss-cross-merges-arise-in-git
[23:41:22] <haymawk> Is there a preferred way to clean it up?
