[08:58:07] <just1602> When I open a rust file and try to run dispatch it didn't find the config
[08:58:31] <just1602> But if I run :set ft=rust and try to run dispatch after that it find the b:dispatch config
[08:58:45] <just1602> Does someone have already had an issue like that?
[08:58:55] <just1602> Thanks :)
[09:06:35] <jamessan> You don't need the autocmd bit of it.  ftplugin files run for every buffer that's detected as that filetype, so all you need to do is the "let b:dispatch ..." bit
[09:07:31] <just1602> Oh okok, thanks ! 
[09:15:14] <p00f> also if this was not an ftplugin you would need the BufRead event, not FileType. I might be wrong
[09:16:08] <just1602> On the vim-dispatch documentation it suggest the FileType event, but I didn't understand that it was meant to be place in the vimrc / init.vim
[09:16:49] <p00f> so i was indeed wrong

[13:20:08] <clason[m]> no, cmp has nothing to do with it
[13:20:32] <ambasta> Alternately, how do I understand why vim.lsp.buf.formatting() is implementing a particular indentation
[13:21:00] <clason[m]> well, `:LspInfo` should show you which server is attached
[13:21:11] <clason[m]> this server gets the `textDocument/format` request
[13:21:47] <clason[m]> how it responds to that request is the server's business; you need to look at their documentation whether something like the indentation is configurable

[17:03:31] <_Real[m]> <lainon_[m]> "why does neovim allow you to..." <- since neovim (and also vim, but in a generic way) implements lua interpreters for plugins to use

[17:03:55] <_Real[m]> so if you already have the interpreter, why not going all the way out and do the lua config?

[20:08:29] <mjlbach[m]> The default behavior of neovim is X, I think the example shown in help is actually a better result because of A, B, C. Is there a prior issue or discussion about why the default is the way it is, and if so could you link me to it?

[20:13:06] <mjlbach[m]> kylo252[m]: I read the whole thread
[20:13:55] <sunjonSenghanBri> I understood it as overflowing some limit, when diagnostics, gitsigns and code_actions/foo were all active
[20:14:39] <mjlbach[m]> I think we had discussion about "namespacing" column in sign column at one point
[20:14:55] <mjlbach[m]> like so you could control all LSP signs go in column 1, all plugin signs go in column 2
[20:15:02] <mjlbach[m]> but that is complexity-high AFAIK
[20:15:51] <sunjonSenghanBri> that's what I was alluding to with :
[20:15:51] <sunjonSenghanBri>  16:57 < sunjon> signs already have a priority and a group. If there were a `SignPlaced` autocmd, 
[20:15:56] <sunjonSenghanBri>  perhaps you could impose your own limit/ordering to each group
[20:16:07] <sunjonSenghanBri> I don't know the real mechanics/complexity though
[20:16:19] <mjlbach[m]> The snippet limits the signs to 1 per diagnostic per line
[20:16:56] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach[m]: oh, I showed it in the image:
[20:16:56] <kylo252[m]> - I don't want to overlap with gitsigns

[20:57:18] <kylo252[m]> at a quick glance, this is a design inherited from vim, and changing it will incur a big penalty
[20:57:19] <kylo252[m]> I don't think it's a particularly appropriate data-model to represent the signs as a list. I want to say a queue is better for this but I don't nearly enough about the code-base, and how long the tail is, to say for certain
[20:57:53] <clason[m]> well, then keep looking, and when you do, you can propose an improvement (even to vim, and then two editors profit!)
[21:00:13] <kylo252[m]> ~~only 10 `goto` statements, might be doable~~  there are probably easier things to fix first
[21:00:15] <clason[m]> (I mean this with respect, but usually it's considered polite to learn enough about the code-base first before poo-pooing the design decisions.)

[21:21:55] <kylo252[m]> the vim patch was a massive PITA and took quite a while to get it done.
[21:21:55] <kylo252[m]> I specifically avoided formatting it to make the review easier, but I feel that it backfired since it got ignored because of the failed CI tests

[21:22:36] <clason[m]> usually people start small, to get an understanding of the code base
[21:22:42] <jamessan[m]> Yeah, there are poor implementations in Vim.  tag lookup used to be quadratic, but then I submitted a PR to fix that.  As they say, code speaks louder than words.

[21:29:22] <clason[m]> (unless I misremember what "the clang-tidy one" was)
[21:29:32] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: idk, I feel like it's very clear when the compiler tells you something is missing/wrong
[21:29:32] <kylo252[m]> since there are very few warnings, anything new should be taken into consideration 
[21:30:17] <kylo252[m]> and `-Wundef` is used in the linux kernel as a hardening flag
[21:31:05] <clason[m]> yes, but it's not in Neovim
[21:31:10] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: I trimmed down the original into this

[21:31:25] <clason[m]> so as far as I can see, it's just cosmetic
[21:31:28] <kylo252[m]> this as one part^
[21:31:41] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: which ones?
[21:31:57] <clason[m]> so very low priority for the few maintainers that are knowledgeable in that area 
[21:32:01] <clason[m]> the warnings
[21:33:08] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: that's why we have tools to tell us what we should look out for
[21:33:08] <kylo252[m]> > bugprone-macro-parentheses
[21:33:08] <kylo252[m]> Macros are expanded by the preprocessor as-is. As a result, there can be unexpected behavior; operators may be evaluated in unexpected order and unary operators may become binary operators, etc.
[21:33:08] <kylo252[m]> https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-macro-parentheses.html
[21:33:32] <clason[m]> again, there's not been an actual issue traced back to these
[21:33:40] <clason[m]> so that's on the "nice to have, but not urgent" list
[21:33:48] <clason[m]> meaning exactly: low priority
[21:34:20] <clason[m]> and never trust a tool blindly
[21:36:12] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: no argument from me there, but it's still a step towards a better codebase
[21:36:12] <kylo252[m]> also, there's a reason why this specific warning has higher "risk" classification than others 
[21:36:14] <ii14[m]> I think parens in macros are a good idea
[21:36:34] <clason[m]> all this doesn't change the "low priority" thing
