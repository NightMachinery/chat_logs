[00:06:48] <artao> trumpet is my longest-played instrument. and the only one i've been formally trained on
[00:07:15] <artao> but i am SERIOUSLY out of practice. I've been working on gettin it back tho. bit by bit
[00:07:26] <artao> step 1 is gettin the lips and tongue back

[00:08:05] <artao> properly tonguing 16th notes @ even 80bpm is rather hard when you've got the back-pressure from buzzing into the mouthpiece
[00:10:03] <artao> Unrelated -- So I was playing my ww1 flight sim yesterday, actually doing a campaign rather than just fly around aimlessly, getting used to the planes. I had just scored my first dogfight win and was heading back to the fray when my computer -- well, the video card specifically -- totally crashed and froze up
[00:10:07] <artao> NOOOO
[00:10:12] <artao> so now i gotta refly that shit
[00:10:27] <artao> Simply flying in formation is tough
[00:11:46] <artao> pretty sure it happend cuz i'm running the game in "virtual super resolution" 3800x1800 along with full 8xEQ antialiasing
[00:12:01] <artao> it looked GREAT tho. MUCH easier to see distant aircraft
[00:12:16] <artao> Spotting other planes is one of the hardest parts
[00:12:43] <artao> Speaking of which ... I need to get my head-tracking working. It really helps with situational awareness

[00:18:01] <macrobat> cozier, softer tone on my 1+1/4C than on the 7C. softer attack and the notes are more bendable

[00:25:09] <macrobat> 5/4C
[00:25:47] <macrobat> I confed the keyboard and removed the thingy that sends a small 1/4
[00:26:53] <macrobat> it doesn't say 5/4 on the mouthpiece. it says 1 1/4, but that looks clumsy on the screen

[00:30:05] <artao> useful info. i've nevre really learned much about outhpiece differences
[00:31:25] <artao> i see
[00:31:35] <artao> there is no standard for mouthpiece numbering. sweet
[00:31:37] <artao> WELL
[00:31:50] <artao> in that case ... my 13a is a Schilke and my 14a4a is a Yamaha
[00:32:07] <artao> your 1+1/4c must be a Bach
[00:32:20] <artao> or 5/4C
[00:32:33] <macrobat> korrekt. is of vincent bach

[10:41:10] <Rashad> rindolf This AI will almost instantly know what it is doing. 
[10:41:36] <Rashad> rindolf And the AI is not guessing what the answer is, it knows what it needs to do. 
[10:41:46] <Rashad> It's a definite procedure.

[10:42:17] <rindolf> Rashad: ah, isit fun training

[10:49:30] <Rashad> morf The idea is so simple, so clear, so basic that it is the kind of thing that is 1) easy to demonstrate (I am working on that, but it's been only 2 days since I had it and I am busy with work), and 2) the kind of thing that people will miss
[10:50:14] <Rashad> Experts like complicated things, like a new billion dollar telescopes that needs a few super computers to digest its information so that a physicist can model a galaxy. 
[10:50:27] <Rashad> I don't have that kind of luxury so I have to work from first principles. 
[10:50:54] <morf> things like telescopes are complicated for a reason
[10:51:11] <morf> if you don't get the thing simplicity is the best, you are no expert
[10:51:25] <morf> get to the thing, that*
[10:52:51] <efex_> experts that I know are all about simplicity.
[10:53:01] <efex_> morf yes!
[10:55:05] <Rashad> When I was in Singapore working on sound source localization as an intern, the professors had sophisticated labs and were working on cutting edge AI to solve the problem. 
[10:55:48] <efex_> sure
[10:56:08] <efex_> they want simple answers, but need complicated equipment to figure it out
[10:56:17] <efex_> that’s ok

[10:56:22] <Janet> ^ Deep Thought 1
[10:56:28] <Rashad> I suggested vibrating the microphone array in a simple sin wave manner. It increased the accuracy noticeably in my simulations. Unfortunately, my internship ended abruptly and I don't know if it also worked in real life environments. 
[10:56:41] <Rashad> But the professors told me they were trying it.

[18:41:05] <louipc> you'd still need something like that with a camera anyways
