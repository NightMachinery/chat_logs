[06:30:15] <Intelo> Hi,
[06:30:50] <Intelo> I find clojure to have too much parans. Is there a way to get rid of those? speciallly the opening and closing ones per line. If so, would that be a good thing to do?
[06:32:59] <seebs> https://xkcd.com/297/
[06:33:06] <seebs> i don't think we're gonna get rid of the ()s in lisps
[06:34:12] <Intelo> seebs https://github.com/boxed/indent-clj#example
[06:36:06] <Intelo> seebs what do you think?
[06:36:56] <seebs> i dunno, i don't think i'd like it. it's an interesting experiment, though.
[06:38:01] <seebs> as an observation: i have ever used python. i hated it a lot. in general, i hate indentation-sensitivity, and find that it is very error-prone.
[06:38:26] <seebs> the usual argument for it is that if you make whitespace control execution, it becomes impossible to have code that does a different thing from what it looks like, and i guess that's sort of true?
[06:38:53] <seebs> but in practice i can always run stuff through a formatter and have no code that does a different thing from what it looks like, and the real problem is always a mismatch between what i'm thinking and what i've written.
[06:39:26] <seebs> and when i have braces, parens, or whatever else, i have something that works a bit like a parity-check for that. if the indentation i write and the () i write don't agree, *something* is wrong and probably i got distracted and made a mistake, and the system can tell me that.
[06:41:25] <leah2> full ack
[06:43:37] <Intelo> seebs ok
[06:43:42] <Intelo> leah2 what>?
[06:43:53] <leah2> what seebs said :)
[06:44:06] <Intelo> full acknowledge?
[06:44:11] <Intelo> well its too much parans
[06:44:12] <leah2> yes
[06:44:15] <leah2> no
[06:44:33] <Intelo> if it could be semi colon ;, it would be manageable too.
[06:44:37] <ToxicFrog> Counterpoint: it is not too much parens
[06:44:48] <leah2> it's already fewer than in other lisps :)
[06:44:55] <seebs> one of my friends actually dislikes that clojure doesn't have *enough* parens
[06:45:12] <Intelo> how isn't it extra noise?
[06:45:15] <seebs> he would have preferred (let [(a b) (c d)]...)
[06:45:42] <Intelo> why `let [(a b) (c d)]..;` was not enough?
[06:45:42] <seebs> well, for one thing, i sometimes indent things differently, or put things on one line. so the () are needed there. but also... i like it being clear what i'm doing?
[06:45:45] <leah2> i like compact let and cond
[06:46:06] <seebs> so the problem with let without () around it is... how do you know when it's done?
[06:46:13] <leah2> can cause some errors ofc
[06:46:13] <seebs> i hate whitespace dependency, so i don't want that.

[06:46:48] <Intelo> seebs you put a ; at end and know its done
[06:46:56] <ToxicFrog> Now there's too many ;
[06:47:00] <ToxicFrog> Replace them parens, IMO.
[06:47:04] <ToxicFrog> *replace them with
[06:47:06] <Intelo> ToxicFrog exactly half of ()
[06:47:07] <leah2> perhaps you should learn ocaml instead ;)
[06:47:08] <seebs> how do i tell what thing the ; is making done?
[06:47:31] <ggb> For context, Lisps are ancient in the population of programming languages. Their structure is quite regular, and can easily be translated into a pythonic syntax with significant whitespace. There are several implementations of exactly this for all major Lisp dialects.
[06:47:32] <ToxicFrog> seebs: I *think* they're only proposing removing parens from top-level forms, in which case the ; would be unambiguous
[06:47:36] <seebs> say i have a let and a cond and i have sub-clauses within the cond. do i just stack the semicolons?
[06:47:36] <ToxicFrog> But also, why?
[06:48:00] <seebs> "top-level" is pretty ambiguous and i *like* that the language doesn't care what level i'm on, it's always the same language nested.
[06:48:06] <Intelo> ToxicFrog from each line
[06:48:08] <ToxicFrog> Like, if syntax bothers you that much, how does removing only the outermost parens of each form help you?
[06:48:08] <ggb> Despite the ease and the availability, none of those whitespace mods have become popular. It is a good thing to reflect on this.
[06:48:22] <Intelo> ToxicFrog to get this  https://github.com/boxed/indent-clj#example

[06:50:02] <ToxicFrog> Intelo: ok, but if you're just removing parens from top-level forms you don't get that, and if you really want that and syntax matters that much to you, why not use python?
[06:50:20] <Intelo> python is not clojure
[06:50:29] <Intelo> I heard clojure is more powerful
[06:50:40] <Intelo> I just started it and was put off by parans
[06:50:45] <Intelo> so I came here
[06:50:53] <ggb> Perhaps the things that are new to you are part of the more power?
[06:51:05] <Intelo> yes
[06:51:11] <Intelo> Igues
[06:51:18] <Intelo> I guess
[06:51:19] <ToxicFrog> What other languages have you used?
[06:51:22] <Intelo> java
[06:51:25] <Intelo> javascript
[06:51:29] <Intelo> little php
[06:51:42] <leah2> you'll get used to it :)
[06:51:46] <Intelo> thats it
[06:51:52] <Intelo> leah2 ok.. :)
[06:52:15] <Intelo> but by nature I get disturbed with any kind of syntax noise, lib noise, etc
[06:52:17] <ggb> I would encourage you to reflect on the attitude that, when learning something new, you presume to know best how to do the thing you do not yet understand.
[06:52:22] <leah2> remember when js was all (function(){...})() ;)

[06:53:09] <ToxicFrog> In my experience:
[06:53:11] <ToxicFrog> - the more languages you use, the less you care about the superficial aesthetics of the language
[06:53:13] <ToxicFrog> - it's good to learn languages outside your comfort zone, because you learn lessons there that remain useful even if you don't end up using that language on a regular basis
[06:53:19] <Intelo> leah2 thats anonym func rarely used

[06:54:16] <Intelo> the js example leah2 pasted    ToxicFrog
[06:54:19] <ToxicFrog> Before async/await and => sugar it was ubiquitous and even now it's pretty common both in hand-written JS and in generated ode
[06:54:40] <Intelo> ToxicFrog yes
[06:54:45] <Intelo> but now it helps
[06:54:55] <ToxicFrog> Also if you don't like noisy code I don't see how you can stand to use Java :P
[06:55:18] <Intelo> ToxicFrog and hence for same reasons:   https://github.com/boxed/indent-clj#example
[06:55:24] <ggb> Yes, plenty of other people on the internet complain about lispy parens. As I noted, there are lots of implementations of de-parenthesized lisps. These implementations are not popular. We cannot do the process of coming to understand this for you.
[06:55:34] <Intelo> ToxicFrog I stepped back from java
[06:55:45] <ggb> If you want to use a white-space mod for a lisp, no one is stopping you. Go for it.
[06:56:15] <Intelo> ggb ok can you share what de parenthesized impl exits?
[06:56:21] <selfsymmetric-mu> ggb: Our threading macros are pretty cool. Singleton forms (-> do not need to be parenned)
[06:56:33] <ggb> You've been linking to one a whole lot in this conversation. Scroll up?
[06:56:37] <Intelo> ggb is there a white space mode in clojure built in? configurable?
[06:56:45] <ggb> Wisp is an implementation for Schemes.
[06:56:48] <Intelo> ggb you said " a lot of"
[06:57:02] <ggb> Racket has DSLs with significant whitespace.
[06:57:06] <Intelo> ok
[06:57:15] <Intelo> ggb is there a white space mode in clojure built in? configurable?
[06:57:27] <Intelo> clojure itself I mean
[06:57:42] <ToxicFrog> Intelo: no.
[06:57:59] <Intelo> ok, thanks
[06:58:29] <Intelo> is vim ok to use for clojure
[06:59:18] <Intelo> last qustion ToxicFrog ggb seebs do you see any language superior to clojure in terms of smart coding, doing more with coding less, more features and power as a programmer
[06:59:34] <Intelo> these are my values as of now
[07:00:00] <ggb> More power? C. Coding less? APL. Smart coding? I have no idea what you mean. Features? C++.
[07:00:07] <ToxicFrog> Those are very vague values.
[07:00:35] <Intelo> ggb thanks
[07:00:35] <ggb> Java and C# are very featureful.
[07:00:50] <ToxicFrog> Personally, I use clojure as my "default language" these days, but there are tasks I prefer Rust, Lua, Python, or zsh for, and most of my coding at work is done in C++ for interoperability with existing C++ code.
[07:01:02] <Intelo> if its lib, clojure can use js and java lips. right?
[07:01:32] <Intelo> ToxicFrog ok
[07:02:34] <ToxicFrog> Also, like...as a general rule, if your immediate reaction upon trying to learn a new thing is to start complaining that "it doesn't look like old thing, how do I make it look more like old thing?" you are (a) not going to get very far and (b) probably going to annoy everyone around you.
[07:02:36] <ToxicFrog> Like...just try it out. Maybe you'll like it. Maybe you'll hate it, but learn something worthwhile in the process. Maybe you'll hate it and not learn anything except that you really care about syntax, in which case you've at least learned something useful about yourself and can try Scala next or something.
[07:02:38] <ToxicFrog> And I mean this for a generalized 'it', not just Clojure specifically.
[07:03:15] <ggb> ^^ What ToxicFrog said. I was in the middle of typing something largely the same.
[07:08:59] <seebs> i do most of my work in Go, which is a very different language. it's one of my favorites because i spend nearly all my time thinking about my problem space and virtually none thinking about the language.
[07:09:14] <seebs> i am liking clojure so far, but the diagnostics from the tooling are sort of impressively bad
[07:15:23] <Intelo> ToxicFrog ggb seebs ok

[17:47:27] <sobel> Para: i'm grappling with my 15-year-old observation that if someone took security exploitation to the max, it would probably destroy the internet, but who's gonna debug ALL THE THINGS
[17:47:47] <sobel> i don't like having that answer now
[17:47:52] <sobel> it was a rhetorical question
[17:48:52] <leah2> is there a reason clojure doesnt have optional arguments? most multi-arity definitions i see in the wild just pass nil as default values...
[17:48:54] <sobel> or so i thought. now i count clojure as part of my defensive posture.
[17:49:28] <Para> leah2: there are, but they don't work quite right :7
[17:49:54] <leah2> hmm, i guess one can do (fn [foo & [bar quux]] ...)
[17:50:01] <leah2> but that swallows additional arguments
[17:50:45] <ToxicFrog> (fn [foo & [bar baz & rest]] ...) works
[17:50:54] <ToxicFrog> (but I don't like it)
[17:50:57] <leah2> and then fail if rest isnt empty
[17:51:29] <Para> leah2: this is in fact a new addition in 1.11 https://clojure.org/news/2021/03/18/apis-serving-people-and-programs
[17:51:56] <leah2> but then i need to name all parameters?
[17:52:07] <ToxicFrog> I think the fail-if-rest-nonempty has to be done by hand :/
[17:52:14] <ToxicFrog> Manually throw Arity or something
[17:52:23] <leah2> ToxicFrog: yeah, which makes is a runtime error
[17:52:56] <ToxicFrog> It's a runtime error anyways unless you're using core.typed or something, though?
[17:53:08] <ToxicFrog> Unless your linter catches it.
[17:53:09] <leah2> maybe i just need to write a defn* ala srfi-89
[17:53:19] <Para> (defn x [& {:keys [a b] :or {a 1 b 2} :as m}] [a b m]) -> (x :a 4) ;=> [4 2 {:a 4}]
[17:53:45] <Para> Problem here is that those defaults don't carry over to the aliased `m`, so it's kind of useful but not quite.
[17:53:54] <leah2> ToxicFrog: hm yeah
[17:54:51] <Para> And CLJS had some issue with `& args` IIRC, because JavaScript doesn't care about number of args given to functions.

[17:55:45] <sobel> the actual syntax rules of JS, when i look closely, are appalling
[17:56:06] <sobel> tired old story, but i keep discovering new chapters
[17:56:15] <Para> I saw a picture recently where someone had reordered JS equivalence rules to the shape of a pentagram.
[17:56:26] *** Quits: puchka (~marius@102.160.110.130) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[17:56:32] <Para> It felt very apt.
[17:56:50] <sobel> i think it was here someone posted the JS equivalence rules superimposed with the christianity trinity equivalence rules
[17:56:59] <sobel> that was sublime
[17:57:31] <Para> And while contrived, noticed today that Firefox JS console is just fine evaulating `!!1!=!1??1` to `true`
[17:57:49] <sobel> ffs
[17:58:28] <Para> I guess it counts as performance enhancement if your keyboard face-slamming also evaluates...?
[18:02:17] <sobel> one time while scanning all the port-mapped memory on my 2nd or 3rd computer i discovered a bit that flipped when i pounded on the table
[18:02:45] <sobel> never did figure out where that i/o was microphoning its way in to my system
[18:03:02] <sobel> but i sure made a userPause() function out of it
[18:03:31] <sobel> i think JS operates on a lot of similar principles
