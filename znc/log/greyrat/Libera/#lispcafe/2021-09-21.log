[00:43:43] <mfiano> moon-child: I enjoyed your well-written posts on the "why lists" thread.
[00:44:30] <selwyn> shka: how is the weight loss going
[00:44:39] <shka> selwyn: stuck at 84 kg
[00:44:41] <shka> forever
[00:45:13] <selwyn> well
[00:45:18] <selwyn> forever is a long time
[00:46:09] <shka> nah, literally 
[00:46:30] <shka> it was multiple months, and my weight never went under 82 kgs
[00:46:39] <shka> it is in general between 82 and 84
[00:46:45] <shka> which is honestly, not bad
[00:46:53] <shka> at least my legs are not killing me
[00:47:25] <selwyn> that´s good
[00:49:19] <shka> anyway, people don't realize that loosing more then 10% of body mass is actually really damn difficult
[00:50:11] <shka> having said that
[00:50:14] <shka> good night
[00:50:45] <selwyn> goodnight shka
[00:51:01] <selwyn> i am planning to lose like 5%
[00:51:10] <selwyn> but it does not seem like a huge deal
[00:51:25] <selwyn> famous last words perhaps :o
[00:51:28] <gilberth> Take care. But remember gaining weight is near impossible.
[00:52:49] <gilberth> At least for me, but I don't try anymore.
[00:53:09] <shka> uh, easy 
[00:53:16] <shka> gilberth: try eating regular meals
[00:53:36] <gilberth> Nothing happens.

[00:55:21] <shka> oh, so it came out?
[00:55:21] <gilberth> Perhaps. One doctor mentioned that it could well be that my body thinks my little weight is its ideal weight.
[00:56:09] <copec> shka: I opened in a bunch of countries on the 15th
[00:56:14] <shka> oh
[00:56:31] <shka> i am not very excited for that movie
[00:56:44] <selwyn> why not? 
[00:57:16] <shka> well, i don't think there is any room for anything interesting here 
[00:57:29] <shka> there was already dune tv series, it was pretty good
[00:57:32] <copec> I was really excited but I mellowed out about it somewhat. Still want to see it
[00:57:38] <shka> and dune is... overrated

[01:02:39] <shka> well, that's ok
[01:02:48] <shka> i used to be dune fan as well
[01:03:00] <selwyn> but it´s been said that you need to have a teenage mentality to enjoy it the first time you read it

[01:04:09] <shka> well, that's when i read it

[01:06:08] <selwyn> also partly why i like it: here is a story about a teenage boy who takes over a whole planet

[01:16:32] <copec>  /sad_trumpet
[01:17:19] <copec> The world and basic plotline are great, but the character building is terrible. I found I didn't really care what happened anymore because I wasn't invested in any of the characters
[01:17:36] <selwyn> in the expanse?
[01:17:41] <copec> Yeah
[01:17:48] <copec> In the books, specifically
[01:17:56] <selwyn> right
[01:18:15] <copec> In the TV series, the characters come across great, in the books they are all completely flat to me
[01:21:25] <copec> I felt the same about Dune in the book, flat characters just playing out a world in commentary of our world.
[01:22:34] <copec> I am admittedly a huge TV/Film Sci-Fi fan, and don't read much fiction, mostly read technical stuff
[01:24:27] <selwyn> i agree that dune does not have much in the way of character development, but the characters are generally very memorable

[09:30:32] <contrapunctus> moon-child: a bicycle helmet, because it is meant to be worn while cycling, cannot by design be as heavy or protective as an automotive helmet; reliable data about the safety of bicycle helmets is scarce; these and some other factors are why it's rather a controversial subject for cyclists.

[10:25:45] <moon-child> are browsers actually still pretending not to be oses?

[11:42:02] <hayley> Anyway, here is a theorem I formulated while doing pathfinding but can't really prove. Say we have some points on a plane, and we need to link them all up. If we draw lines from each point to the nearest other point, then the lines won't overlap.
[11:42:33] <hayley> At least, any case of overlap I can come up with violates the precondition that we pick the closest points.
[11:43:56] <selwyn> hm

[12:23:09] * hayley got a response: "Async/await isn't meant for CPU paralellism, it's for IO."
[12:23:33] <hayley> The thing is: IO gets faster, CPUs mostly get faster by adding moar cores. So you end up CPU-bound again if you only use one thread.
[12:27:14] <hayley> And I bet such programs where async/await works well have embarassingly parallel parts, which aren't hard to implement with multiple threads.

[12:47:15] <hayley> tl/dr https://i.redd.it/n9o42vxg2wt61.jpg
[12:51:09] <hayley> Or, another way of thinking about it, olde Lisp systems had a WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS that basically stopped the rest of the world while some criticial section ran. Then it was considered a dumb idea. Now it's not considered a dumb idea again.
[12:59:52] <selwyn> what
[13:00:44] <hayley> That's how I see async/await with explicit awaiting points. Everything between await points is in a WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS.
[13:01:23] <Duuqnd[m]1> I have never learned how async and await stuff works (I've heard it's just event loop stuff?). Should I?
[13:01:29] <hayley> Nah.
[13:01:43] <Duuqnd[m]1> I mean, it might be good to know for discussions like these
[13:02:04] <Duuqnd[m]1> But yeah, from the little I've seen I've never had the desire to use it
[13:02:12] * hayley had a meme on this, and misfiled it.
[13:03:00] <hayley> It's really a performance hack, and one that's only good if you find yourself awaiting on IO most of the time. And I don't like that argument, because it is totally dependent on IO and single-core speed.

[13:30:01] <selwyn> how its defined?
[13:30:46] <hayley> Yeah, big-O is worst-case so that's weird.
[13:32:47] <dave0> i like algorithms that use a little sprinkle of randomness :-)
[13:33:29] <kakuhen> hayley: presumably you're dealing with a stochastic process so you are taking asymptotics of its expected value
[13:33:50] <kakuhen> thats the most obvious guess at a definition of "average big-O" to me
[13:34:00] <kakuhen> i saw it once when dealing with random graphs, i think? but this was 2 years ago
[13:39:17] <selwyn> for a problem instance of size n, you can define the average running time of all the 2^n possible inputs
[13:39:35] <selwyn> (assuming your input is a binary string of length n)
[13:39:57] <selwyn> and then try to bound this function above in the usual way with big O notation
[13:40:24] <hayley> I see.
[13:40:52] <selwyn> this appears to be what the paper does, though i have not finished it yet
[13:41:34] <selwyn> the reason for this is that there are some hard problem inputs that have exponentially small probability, so an average case bound does not seem too irrelevant

[14:19:01] <gilberth> Is that a German thing?
[14:19:43] <selwyn> yes ime?
[14:20:39] <Gnuxie> I've never actually drank coffee, does it really have a good effect? should I try it after work before evening hacks or will that just kill me the next day? 
[14:21:21] <gilberth> Curious. Anyhow, in '19 and '20 coffee was bad for me, now it even is recommended by the doctor and I enjoy it as I used to be a coffee addict. *shrug*
[14:21:47] <pl> Gnuxie: depends on individual
[14:22:00] <gilberth> Gnuxie: It has an effect, but it wears off as with any drug.
[14:22:12] <pl> also, a lot of coffee preparation methods / styles of coffee give wildly different results when it comes to your enjoyment and/or effects
[14:22:26] <selwyn> as does tolerance, of which you have none
[14:22:35] <Gnuxie> cool 
[14:22:54] <Gnuxie> maybe i should save it for an occasion to go berserk 
[14:23:07] <gilberth> Heh.
[14:23:15] <selwyn> i know someone who gave up coffee partly in order to do that
[14:23:42] <selwyn> as in, they gave up for 28 days, since this is apparently the withdrawal period
[14:24:06] <selwyn> and after that, they noticed the benefit was much more pronounced and they only save it for special occasions
[14:24:37] <gilberth> Yep, as I said, it wears off like with any drug.
[14:26:17] <gilberth> I drink a lot of coffee, but I prepare a pretty strong coffee in the morning and not so strong in the evening.

[20:10:46] <selwyn> the reason why average case complexity is useful in that case is because some inputs are much more likely than others
[20:11:50] <selwyn> in particular, that is because the worst case is associated with having a large amount of errors during a quantum computation that are present within a spatially large extent
[20:11:53] <selwyn> which is very unlikely
[20:20:22] <shka> well, the worst case for hash table is O(n) while the average and the expected is O(1)
[20:20:27] <shka> so no duh
[20:24:34] <selwyn> in this case you should plan for the worst case though
[20:24:42] <selwyn> hash tables get all kinds of things put into them
[20:24:59] <selwyn> the worst case could easily be the observed case
[20:27:04] <selwyn> otoh, if your input is a bunch of error measurement outcomes that are exponentially likely not to form a huge connected chain, then, well
[20:28:26] <shka> selwyn: well, that's why there is a random seed in the python string hash function
[20:28:38] <selwyn> uh
[20:28:45] <selwyn> should hash functions have random seeds?
[20:29:17] <shka> i would argue against it 
[20:29:38] <selwyn> it seems to violate the spirit
[20:29:42] <shka> yeah
[20:29:54] <shka> i mean, it is a process wide random seed
[20:30:14] <selwyn> what
[20:30:16] <shka> so hash value in python can't be exchanged against the processes
[20:30:20] <selwyn> so distributed hash tables are out
[20:30:36] <shka> not out, but you can't use the default hash function
[20:30:45] <selwyn> great
[20:31:41] <shka> not great either, because hash function written in python would be usually slow
[20:32:06] <shka> also, this "feature" can bite your ass
[20:33:01] <shka> it certainly was the case for me
[20:33:35] <shka> but on the flip side, python libs using dicts are protected from malicious hash collisions
[20:33:40] <shka> so that's something i guess
[20:34:26] <selwyn> i have come to expect serious languages to provide hash functions that are good enough instead of writing my own lol
[20:34:42] <selwyn> what´s a malicious hash collision?
[20:34:52] <shka> dude, python is named after the "monty python"
[20:34:58] <shka> it is not "serious"
[20:35:00] <shka> :P
[20:36:28] <shka> selwyn: you can construct a huge json object that after parsing will generate degenerate hash table that will linear probe trough the whole content at each read attempt
[20:36:45] <selwyn> oh right
[20:36:54] <gilberth> Having a random value mixed into your hash function is essentially a randomized algorithm. You use those to escape the worst case complexity. This may seem like a hack in the runtime analysis of your algorithm, but defeats attacks on your worst case. The reasoning in general is: As the worst case is a random [secret] input, the attacker cannot easily guess that. Apart from an attacker, this also works in general.
[20:37:00] <shka> do that enough times and you can bring the web application to it's knees 
[20:37:30] <shka> gilberth: thanks
[20:37:36] <shka> selwyn: what gilberth said
[20:37:46] <selwyn> oh
[20:38:16] <shka> anyway, i would argue that such thing should not be a default behavior 
[20:39:17] <shka> or at least the seed should be passed to the hashing function so it is only randomized when it matters
[20:39:21] <gilberth> I would argue otherwise. This amortizes such that the worst case isn't pathological anymore.
[20:39:43] <shka> yeah, i agree that there is reason to do so
[20:40:11] <shka> but i think that it would suffice if hashtable would pass a random seed instead of it being a global behavior
[20:41:04] <shka> in lisp you can at least implement your own hash function and it has a chance to perform well
[20:41:13] <shka> in python... pull out the C
[20:41:22] <shka> which, sucks
[20:41:45] <gilberth> I agree that this at first might seem like .oO(Oh what the hack!), but it is a valid strategy also for things like scheduling.
[20:42:00] <shka> yes, certainly
[20:42:14] <gilberth> To be fair: User hash functions are non-standard in CL.
[20:43:18] <gilberth> But when in doubt we have proper compilers and could always craft our own hash tables, if we wish.
[20:43:23] <shka> i don't disagree with this approach being valuable solution, i am just at odds with idea of having it always on, on all strings, in all contexts
[20:43:48] <gilberth> shka: It doesn't hurt.
[20:46:07] <shka> i wonder if cl permits this
[20:46:34] <shka> it does not
[20:46:47] <shka> even if x and y exist in different Lisp images
[20:46:49] <shka> pretty clear
[20:47:13] <gilberth> What? CL says nothing about the hash function used.
[20:47:29] <shka> not the hash-table
[20:47:31] <shka> sxhash
[20:47:45] <shka> i was wondering if sxhash permits randomization
[20:47:58] <gilberth> Yes, but SXHASH has nothing to do with hash tables.
[20:48:05] <shka> i know
[20:48:30] <shka> i mean, hash is not used only for hash-tables
[20:48:39] <shka> as you pointed out
[20:49:23] *** Quits: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[20:50:36] <gilberth> SXHASH only promises to be stable within a "session".
[20:50:57] <shka> are you sure?
[20:51:20] *** Joins: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth)
[20:51:20] <shka> "even if x and y exist in different Lisp images" seems to contradict you
[20:51:24] *** Joins: pjb (~pjb@user/pjb)
[20:52:26] <gilberth> For the listed data types, only.
[20:52:35] <shka> yeah
[20:52:41] <shka> i guess
[20:55:49] <gilberth> Third paragraph of the "Notes", too. In essence for objects compared with EQ by EQUAL (but symbols), the implementation could use some hash of the address of that object. (If that address does not change within a session).
[20:57:54] <gilberth> So, yes, a random salt is not ok for the listed data types. The SXHASH value must be transportable in those cases.
[21:06:46] *** Joins: yewscion (~yewscion@2604:ca00:149:479::60:4768)
[21:08:43] <gilberth> Oh, seems like I missed a good day to buy more stock after quotes went down the last days.
[21:09:47] <gilberth> Have I mentioned that my timing is far from optimal?
[21:11:36] <White_Flame> it's china real estate collapsing, and its fallout
[21:11:47] <shka> oh, nice 
[21:11:49] <White_Flame> it might keep the market down for a bit, could still get in
[21:12:01] <White_Flame> depending on which symbol
[21:12:03] <shka> real estate crash, just what i needed for Christmas
[21:12:13] <gilberth> White_Flame: Yep, perhaps.
[21:12:32] <White_Flame> it's all of china's empty massive developments for "investment" that are getting underwater and developers are bankrupt
[21:12:45] <gilberth> shka: I wait for the european real estate crash, so that I might afford to buy a flat or a house.
[21:14:36] <selwyn> looking forward to energy and food shortages
[21:14:39] <selwyn> return to woolton pie
[21:14:55] <gilberth> Once ECB interest rates raise, it'll be a disaster here waiting to happen.
[21:15:35] <gilberth> selwyn: Energy? Is energy hauled by trucks?
[21:17:20] <shka> hmmm, maybe i should woolton pie for tomorrow
[21:18:27] <selwyn> it is hauled by grid interconnects
[21:18:30] <selwyn> one of which is broken
[21:18:34] <selwyn> but there are lots of other reasons
[21:19:26] <gilberth> I bet, energy still is less expensive than here.
[21:19:26] <selwyn> one interesting thing is that the gas shortages are leading to co2 shortages => food and beer shortages
[21:19:33] <selwyn> gilberth: apparently not
[21:19:47] <selwyn> at least as far as electricity spot prices are concerned
[21:20:23] <gilberth> selwyn: No? I pay 30ct/kWh for electricity. Can you beat that?

[21:21:20] <selwyn> 	British Steel, which is owned by Chinese industrial conglomerate Jingye, said it was now being quoted a maximum price at peak times of “up to £2,500” per megawatt hour, compared with an average rate of £50/MWh in April.

[21:21:29] <selwyn> not consumer prices though
[21:21:34] <selwyn> sorry for the copyright notice
[21:22:59] <selwyn> so steel making is sometimes uneconomical
[21:23:25] <gilberth> Sounds like Britain is strewed.
[21:23:37] <Gnuxie> that is really expensive 
[21:25:00] <gilberth> Damn paywalls, where is micro-payment?
[21:26:13] <selwyn> ~17ct/kwh in england according to some websites, idk how much we pay
[21:26:29] <selwyn> though i imagine that figure predates the current shortage
[21:27:44] <gilberth> I mean, those news site really are dumb. First they have annoying, that is animated, ads on their page, Now people use ad-blocks and they in effect don't want money for reading the article. When there would be a way to pay say 5ct to read a single article, that would be fine with me, but not a subscription.
[21:28:01] <selwyn> i have very mixed feelings about the financial times
[21:28:38] <gilberth> selwyn: Well, the plan of our local politics is to make engery expensive, so that we will use less and the rest of the world more. To save the climate.
[21:28:44] <selwyn> so i hear
[21:29:14] <selwyn> well, admittedly you guys have pioneered a lot of green energy techniques that the world can use
[21:29:32] <selwyn> paid for by germany
[21:29:34] <selwyn> so the system works i guess
[21:30:55] <gilberth> selwyn: I am not talking about the FT in particular, but news sites in general. I may get a pointer to an article I really want to read and in practice cannot without a subscription, which is not-acceptable. Could I just pay a few cents, I may well pay that, and to a different news provider every other day.
[21:30:57] <selwyn> i wonder if the government will be able to ride out an energy crisis
[21:31:13] <selwyn> gilberth: yes i see the appeal of that. i am fortunate enough to enjoy an institutional subscription to the ft
[21:31:23] <selwyn> but their annual rates, damn
[21:31:47] <selwyn> £154 for 1 year
[21:31:56] <selwyn> i wouldn´t be able to justify that
[21:32:36] <selwyn> it is unfortunate because it is the only newspaper left in britain that does proper journalism
[21:33:05] <gilberth> selwyn: Oil which I don't use, will be used by someone else. So where is the gain? Second: When coal power will be turned off (remember that nuclear will be turned of next year), we'll need Russian gas for turbines (sic!) with more CO_2 produced per kWh as with coal. Brilliant move!
[21:33:24] <selwyn> gas produces more co2 than coal?
[21:33:41] <gilberth> In turbine power stations, yes.
[21:33:59] <selwyn> huh
[21:34:40] <selwyn> well, as i have learnt recently, some of that co2 is an important byproduct
[21:34:55] <gilberth> For beer?
[21:35:01] <selwyn> and animal stunning
[21:35:14] <selwyn> + hospitals
[21:35:31] <gilberth> But it will still end up in the atmosphere, won't it?
[21:35:55] <selwyn> yes
[21:36:58] <gilberth> Anyhow, I am sick of the German politics wrt to climate change. All that really happens is that we face more taxes.
[21:38:36] <gilberth> You know my opinion: We should go nuclear as fast as we can. I haven't changed my opinion since Chernobyl. At that time I was young and the accident triggered me to think about it.
[21:42:51] <selwyn> i found out recently that the engineers that drained the steam suppression pool did not actually die as reported at the time
[21:43:01] <selwyn> one of them carried on working in the nuclear industry. damn
[21:43:53] <gilberth> So in essense I blame the local Green party, which has its roots in the anti-nuclear protest for us not producing less CO_2 as we do.
[21:45:10] <gilberth> selwyn: Yes, it is surprisingly less fatalities than is suggested. However I am in general a bit skeptical about documentaries around that topic as it is a political issue, too.
[21:45:19] <selwyn> me too
[21:45:54] <selwyn> when i was at school we learned that the three men sacrificed themselves
[21:46:10] <selwyn> but decades later they tell a different story, when people bothered to find them
[21:46:26] <gilberth> Sorry, that is almost funny.
[21:47:57] <gilberth> "Hello, is that you, Mr. XYZ?" "Yes." "Oh, you're dead, didn't you read the news?" "Hugh?"
[21:52:57] <gilberth> I wonder how many coal mine workers died premature. My step mom grew up in the Ruhr area with lot's of mining. She and her class-mates all had fathers working there, and none of them actually got older than 60yo. All died from bad lungs.
[21:56:32] <selwyn> there was a really bad disaster in wales
[21:56:48] <gilberth> What happened?
[21:57:03] <selwyn> aberfan
[21:57:23] * gilberth reads
[21:57:26] <selwyn> idiots put a coal dust (?) dump above a village
[21:57:34] <selwyn> after rain it formed a landslide
[22:03:51] <gilberth> Dust? Perhaps just whatever is digged up not being coal? Dunno.
[22:04:43] <selwyn> yeah that stuff
[22:06:31] <gilberth> The whole of the Ruhr area has pumps running for eternity because otherwise the area would convert into lake landscape and to keep the ground water free of pollution. Let's talk about the half-life of nuclear "waste" again.
[22:08:32] <gilberth> But yes, it's just irresponsible to pile that stuff up above a village. That was a disaster waiting to happen, I guess.
[22:10:02] <selwyn> wales also had a village demolished in order to make it easier to supply liverpool with water
[22:10:55] <selwyn> they are treated kind of like a colony when it comes to environmental stuff imo
[22:11:23] <gilberth> We still erase villages each year to get at coal by above-the-ground mining.
[22:14:09] <selwyn> in germany?
[22:14:59] <gilberth> Yes. To get at brown coal.
[22:20:57] <gilberth> It's these monsters eating the coal: <https://ucpcdn.thyssenkrupp.com/_legacy/UCPthyssenkruppBAIS/assets.files/products___services/mining_systems/bucket_wheel_excavators/bagger-288/bucket-wheel-bagger-288_image_h664.jpg> <https://ucpcdn.thyssenkrupp.com/_legacy/UCPthyssenkruppBAIS/assets.files/products___services/mining_systems/bucket_wheel_excavators/bagger-288/bagger-288-in-action_image_h664.jpg>
[22:21:09] <gilberth> At times a village is in the way.
[22:22:42] <gilberth> Something I blame the Green movement for, too.
[22:24:21] <selwyn> picture reminds me of the fallout new vegas mine
[22:25:48] <gilberth> Wikipedia says the excavator is 220m long. A beast.
[22:27:29] <gilberth> There is a nice panorama on Wikipedia of what it looks like, when the beast was there: <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Tagebau_Garzweiler_Panorama_2005.jpg>

[22:33:32] <gilberth> Ah, wget helped. Curious.
[22:34:11] <gilberth> selwyn: Yes, like that, only larger still.

[23:12:36] <gilberth> Yep, it shows me I would need 3.2GWh in batteries for Hamburg alone, and 1000 wind turbines. What I miss is the capital costs.
[23:13:18] <pl> They are buried on the details, the advanced params contain capital costs per kWh for each source/store 
[23:13:53] <pl> The resulting cost is for making it break even for the lifetime of the plants 
[23:14:43] <pl> BTW, it funnily enough matches what I'd like to use to replace current EU energy market with 
[23:14:50] <gilberth> Ah ok. But the site is biased. It quotes the costs for enegery the customer pays, which is taxes included, and does not say that the costs quoted are the same.
[23:15:19] <pl> Eh? I thought the disclaimer was pretty big on that 
[23:19:47] <gilberth> I could only guess. So what is the current cost per kWh, not what is charged? It doesn't say that.
[23:21:02] <gilberth> It also doesn't mention what area I would need to install that wind turbines and solar panels.

[23:25:30] <gilberth> Ok. Without that hydrogen storage it says, I need 60GWh in batteries and end up at 23ct/kWh, which would be like 100ct/kWh for the customer, given current taxes. And use every square inch of the city for solar panels. Thanks.
[23:26:17] <gilberth> Won't work.

[23:33:28] <pl> Anyway, the kind of plant setup it proposes that is supposed to give constant supply, is what I'd like to be prioritised instead of dumbly letting wind crater the price

[23:37:27] <gilberth> Well, unlike with conventional power the renewable power does not respond to demand.
[23:37:41] *** Joins: ec (~ec@gateway/tor-sasl/ec)
[23:38:04] <gilberth> So you need lots of backup installed power.
[23:38:31] <gilberth> Or a storage technology, which is not available.
