[00:00:20] <lacroix> can you prove that claim, AssKoala ?
[00:00:23] <AssKoala> lacroix, of course, it depends
[00:00:29] <lacroix> show me.
[00:00:31] <hexnewbie> rbox: I think it came from this bug: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=931433
[00:00:42] <rbox> damn debian people making my life difficult!
[00:00:46] <rbox> what's new!
[00:00:51] <ayecee> lacroix: what form of proof would you accept?
[00:00:52] *** Quits: varioust (~varioust@gateway/tor-sasl/varioust) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[00:00:53] <AssKoala> lacroix, well, I can point you to docs from vendors that claim those potential gains, I can't like send you proprietary information from the company.
[00:01:08] <rbox> ayecee: sometimes zip files have a comment that says what made them, no such comment on this though
[00:01:10] <AssKoala> I make video games, my area of expertise is in optimization and systems architecture
[00:01:21] <AssKoala> and I noted why PGO works
[00:01:44] <AssKoala> the other big gain we get with PGO is a decrease in variance of CPU frame times
[00:01:47] <lacroix> AssKoala: I have trouble seeing how it can apply for general-purpose kernels (such as eg. distro kernels), or even eg. android kernels.  For a machine that has a single purpose, you're obviously right, which was not what we were discussing.
[00:02:00] <AssKoala> lacroix, you didnt specify for the kernel
[00:02:19] <AssKoala> but, even there, you can make gains if you recompile the kernel for your specific system
[00:02:23] <lacroix> AssKoala: wasn't that the context of the discussion?
[00:02:25] <hexnewbie> rbox: Vanilla infozip may work
[00:02:27] * lacroix smiles
[00:02:31] <ayecee> yeah well you didn't specify for games so
[00:02:33] <AssKoala> lacroix, not exactly?
[00:02:38] <AssKoala> its not games only
[00:02:38] <lacroix> right
[00:02:43] <rbox> hexnewbie: well its still complaiing that parts of the zip are corrupt
[00:02:47] <AssKoala> any application, or kernel, can get wins from PGO
[00:02:57] <AssKoala> but its going to be optimal for that particular profile sety
[00:03:05] <lacroix> AssKoala: So basically with an embedded system, yes. But that wasn't the context
[00:03:08] *** Joins: clarjon1 (~clarjon1@user/clarjon1)
[00:03:09] <ayecee> AssKoala: okay so it doesn't matter if kernel was specified?
[00:03:29] <hexnewbie> You *can* have a game as a kernel module. (Bad idea of 2022 candidate #17619)
[00:03:38] <AssKoala> no, not just embedded systems.  If I run a NAS and have a kernel that I recompile feeding in profiles from my systems usage, I'll get some amount of gains
[00:04:13] *** Joins: maret (~maret@nat-88-212-37-89.antik.sk)
[00:04:14] <AssKoala> PGO will rarely make anything demonstrably slower -- it primarily acts as a better guide for LTO
[00:04:14] <ayecee> don't reckon that will make much difference in that application
[00:04:16] <lacroix> AssKoala: In short and in brief, and to put it it simply, Exactly.  So for a system that does multiple things, none of them get anywhere near the maximum benefit.
[00:04:36] <clarjon1> haldo
[00:04:56] <lacroix> me an pretty everyone else here, thought, you claimed that pgo brings 10-20% speedup for the linux kernel.
[00:04:58] <hexnewbie> rbox: Well, that's corrupted archives for you. Those bad floppies were unrecoverable.
[00:05:02] <AssKoala> lacroix, maybe -- one of the optimizations is actually code duplication, so even on a general system, it may duplicate code more intelligently than basic inline fucntions
[00:05:08] <AssKoala> lacroix, my apologies, I meant as a general statement

[00:07:35] <hexnewbie> If you have a gazillion context switches, and fires up Meltdown trampolines on *every* context switch, those 20%.... Well, I guess given that the Meltdown fix didn't obliterate the performance completely, 1% sounds about right.
[00:08:02] <AssKoala> hexnewbie, if you're context switching that much, you arent really doing much real work then :)
[00:08:16] <hexnewbie> AssKoala: Story of my life
[00:08:21] <AssKoala> I mean, the quanta is usually around 10ms, so you have to be doing a ton of switches for it to matter

[01:42:53] <Fieldy> hello, i'm trying to learn kubernetes by installing it from scratch. I've been at it 5 days now following the official documents, and it's just a land mine field of confusing and sometimes conflicting or unclear instructions. is there some distro out there that it can be installed from its default repos to have a working base? ubuntu-server isn't it that's for sure
[01:43:03] <Fieldy> #kubernetes is silent

[01:44:47] <hexnewbie> I've faced that with Ceph. I've faced that with OpenStack. And, by proxy, I've faced that with Kubernetes. It's the reality, page 3 says never cross the streams, page 172 says cross the streams immediately.
[01:44:48] <Fieldy> yeah a job that's mine for the taking needs me to be able to set up elk within docker within kubernetes, but just setting up kubernetes has become a roadblock, i need to move on

[01:48:41] <hexnewbie> Like, Ceph's documentation on placement groups, instead of saying “Keep 100-200 placement group copies per disk, total”, writes an essay of 20-30 pages of confusing, self-contradicting nonsense, whose most logical interpretation leads to create 2000-3000 PG copies per disk, but also at times says that 30 is enough at one point, then goes to tell you that you need the understand “the tradeoff” (without pointing upsides and downsides)

[06:38:17] <rbox> sadhands: you need to install libglib2.0-dev:i386 and make sure your stuff is picking up the headers from it instead of the 64-bit one

[08:24:03] <MinusOne> Hmm. Yeah, I don't know. The programming I do rarely goes beyond bash scripts and maybe a little python. If I feel masochistic, maybe dipping my toes into very rudimentary C =P
[08:24:56] <very_sneaky> even python is dealt with a little strangely though - in apt, you have to explicitly install pip as python3-pip rather than just having it come with the python distribution like it does most other places

[12:27:50] <hexnewbie> fdsdf: Why would it store file encoding?

[12:28:35] <pystardust> fdsdf: yeah thats my questions, to what extent are they heavy?
[12:28:38] <jim> pystardust, to make a web app work in all situations, you have to test it against every browser out there

[12:55:40] <Sauvin> node1, you don't say what language you're working with and what the purpose of understanding sets is, exactly.
[12:56:14] <labrador> I think he just wants to understand them Sauvin,maybe a maths book is better then here tho node1
[12:56:48] <Sauvin> Sometimes math books are a mistake because they're full of all kinds of symbols that the uninitiated find cryptic and intimidating.
[12:56:48] <jim> pystardust, and, we're not unreasonable, we realise you might be retraining a habit... so for a (little) while, you'll just get reminders
[12:57:43] <pystardust> jim: no problem, I'm gonna type like I'm writing a paper. Laugh Out Loud
[12:57:43] <ramblebamble> Sauvin, then you are trying to advance to quickly?

[12:58:50] <node1> Sauvin,  The purpose is to learn set and apply it's theory in practical.
[12:58:58] <ramblebamble> Sauvin, you are barely able to jump right in unless you do it on a day to day basis, that is correct, for the average joe, reading it cover to cover is the best idea or at least chapterwise

[12:59:18] <labrador> I do not

[13:00:41] <ramblebamble> pystardust, nice book thanks and there is even a pdf-link I found *dream*
[13:00:46] <labrador> jim, most people aren't good at maths. I think its a good assumption
[13:01:06] <ramblebamble> Sauvin, but isn't it the same with all things you put your mind to unless you do them on a day to day basis?
[13:01:18] <labrador> ramblebamble, yeah you do need to do it daily
[13:01:22] <labrador> Like 2-3 hours
[13:01:23] <ramblebamble> the special case with math is that it is less forgiving
[13:01:43] <pystardust> ramblebamble: try till chapter 3 set theory
[13:01:46] <node1> Here in academic they taught maths as laborious effort. They don't teaches you how to visualize and make use of it ( applied mathematics ), they just prepared you to be the part of workforce

[13:02:39] <labrador> node1, well then it'll be extra hard if you don't actually understand it and just know how to do stuff. though that is exactly my knowledge in maths.
[13:02:42] <node1> I feel maths is not remembering formulas and doing exercise and memorizing it. I feel it's way to think and visualize
[13:02:55] <labrador> Its just a step harder to 'grok' maths
[13:03:09] <pystardust> node1: I agree, even if you planning on studying Physics as a major, you will have to take math for granted. My ego couldn't take it
[13:03:40] <labrador> pystardust, yeah you basically need to say "This works,I don't know why it works,but this works"
[13:04:14] <jim> labrador, I do understand that math has its symbols, and some of them take awhile to get used to. this is in the same category as making fun of someone's chosen identity: it's just not a good idea :)
[13:04:22] <node1> remembering formulas and doing exercise and memorizing it (laborious effort) that waht in academics they teaches you. They don't tell you why , how and where to use this
[13:04:42] <labrador> jim, ok
[13:04:44] <pystardust> If it were a black box. Say like a program like sed. I don't mind not knowing the source code but knowing how each function works in and out. But we can't do that with math, cause it's logic itself, so transparent that it feels wrong to take it granted
[13:05:01] <ramblebamble> node1, that is exactly why I left university for technical university
[13:05:16] <labrador> it does yeah,and you're forced to do the same in high school. Feels sick doesnt it pystardust
[13:05:26] <ramblebamble> pystardust, chapter 3 is actually quite a smooth read from what I read so far
[13:05:28] <labrador> Its transparent yet a black box
[13:05:29] <fdsdf> I found it! was in .local/share/recently=used.xbel
[13:05:52] <node1> here Univerity is just mearly factory to produce machines these machine feel the requirements of industry. That sit
[13:05:53] <pystardust> ramblebamble: nice, but do read the previous parts, math usually doesn't make sense if u skip chapters
[13:06:04] <node1> s/feel/fill
[13:06:30] <node1> Anyway i'm also part of these system :D
[13:06:47] <ramblebamble> pystardust, I know those previous chapters ;) what is really good about that book is it defines analysis, which is s.th. I only got to get my head around at the end of studying
[13:06:48] <labrador> Some of that is just because school prepares people for different stuff. So you can't really start from the bedrock of maths.

[13:33:44] <Scisista> yeah well nothing happens
[13:34:11] <jim> Gaboradon, when grub looks for something to boot, it's usually a kernel, and grub will find it by name, in a filesystem that grub understands. (same is true when there is also an initramfs image.) usually, when new kernels are installed, and when initrds are regenerated from the new kernels and the modules of those new kernels, it picks up the names of those things, and builds grub menus from them.

[13:35:07] <Gaboradon> Hmm, I can still see Fedora boot files there, while I'm in openSUSE /boot/efi   -efibootmgr seems to only remove the menu from appearing but doesn't completely clean files, like some people said on stackoverflow.

[16:35:50] <NyB> WG is simpler when you control both ends, and requires less in terms of resources. OpenVPN is far more ubiquitous and can be configured in ways that work better with restricted connections.
