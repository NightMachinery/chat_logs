[00:40:59] <MrElendig> downside is that the G series are now mostly not compatible with the unifying controller :(

The problem is that it is an OLD i7-940, so it doesn't have `aes` in the CPU.

[04:04:14] <Dagmar> Psi-Jack: Probably perfectly reasonable to keep them separate since very little of the OS will change from day to day, but /home is another matter
[04:04:18] <rascul> well, each home directory i'm interested in i backup completely separate

[04:05:02] <Psi-Jack> Dagmar: Yeah. That's what I'm thinking. borgmatic does a great job of my system, and Vorta seems to be a great user-based backup front-end for the userspace.

[05:49:35] <Psi-Jack> Pretty much the answer is.... No not really.

[06:32:31] <jaggz> akoana, that worked
[06:32:32] <jim> doesn't find have an ls builtin, to run similar to ls -l?
[06:32:44] <Psi-Jack> jim: It has an output format.
[06:32:58] <akoana> jaggz: so ls is not /bin/ls
[06:33:05] <Psi-Jack> So, again, the reason why using ls in a find run is kinda like pointless.
[06:33:09] <jaggz> wait what's the difference between the + and \; ?
[06:33:23] <Psi-Jack> jaggz: + == xargs parallelism.
[06:33:28] <jim> well let's try this: find . -maxdepth 1 -name ls -ls

[06:40:18] <jim> jeffreybenzos[m], if it's worded that way, chances are good that instead of "I'm trying to test xyx, and the messages aren't helpful, because they say "foo", they will instead hear you say: "You SUCK! Write yo crap bettah"

[07:29:05] <leeper> People, I'm just trying to find the best way to auto-remove then auto-add btsusb upon startup automatically. It's the only thing that fixes this bluetooth issue
[07:29:29] <leeper> If I can do it without root, then I'm all ears
[07:29:58] <Psi-Jack> leeper: Okay. That, then, is wrong. 🙂
[07:30:14] <Psi-Jack> Upon startup of what, exactly? Login to desktop? System boot?
[07:30:46] <leeper> login, although having my keyboard at login screen would be nicer
[07:31:00] <leeper> yes, login to desktop
[07:31:01] <Psi-Jack> What exactly is the actual problem itself?

[11:21:37] <jim> I think you need x to be able to cd into that dir

[11:23:35] <hingoanashi1209> and that would just decrypt to the program accessing it and not be visible to anyone else on the system?
[11:23:36] <rudi_s> It's basically like sshfs but decrypts the files locally. On the remote side it's a directory tree (same structure as decrypted) of encrypted files.

[11:30:51] <rudi_s> However, any process running as your user has access to your files in $HOME so it can write arbitrary files and run arbitrary code. There's not much reason to try to hide decrypted files from then because they can still access it anyway.

[11:32:15] <rudi_s> TL;DR: All of your processes have access to all your files one way or another anyway. So you cannot really protect decrypted files from your user so there's not much gained by not using tools like gocryptfs to "mount" decryptes files and make them accessible for your user.

[11:48:59] <hingoanashi1209> do they work well for individual files?
[11:49:13] <rudi_s> And there is (almost) no difference to "mount decrypted version, read file, unmount" to "decrypt in software, read, close". Either an attacker will only read your tree from time to time, then it doesn't matter. Or it really wants to access the file so the "short time" doesn't matter and it will just grab the decrypted content from memory.
[11:49:25] <rty> if you also use one cypher on top of another, on top of another, that's going to slow it down. if it's not AES, it's going to be tremendously slower
[11:49:34] <hingoanashi1209> you can even use gpg, but that has the drawbacks I mentioned. ex even has something.
[11:49:34] <rudi_s> gocryptfs definitely does, LUKS is bit more clunky.
[11:49:47] <rudi_s> Or you could use age/gpg/etc.

[11:50:42] <hingoanashi1209> also there is and encrypted loop mount
[11:50:59] <rty> btw, another good containereized storage is keepass, e.g. keepassxc implementation. you can store arbitrary files attached to entries
[11:51:10] <rudi_s> And don't kid yourself. Do you use separate passwords for each file? Good passwords? If not, there's not much difference when you decrypt them all because an attacker can simply read the password you enter ...

[14:45:05] <archie> MrElendig sure may be. My laptop has 24 gb of RAM (16+8) though I rarely use more than 8 and surely I never went above 16. I wonder if disabling a slot (if there's a bios option or whatever) or removing it could reduce power comsuption in order to increase battery life
[14:45:16] <MrElendig> archie: no
[14:45:19] <TJ-> esselfe: the 'address already in use' is likely due to gkrellmd not setting SO_LINGER to a low/0 timeout so the kernel keeps the socket around. If you kill and then immediately try to restart the process listening on the same addr/port, it'll still be in use

[16:38:25] <akik> i remember there's an english term something like bruhaha
[16:38:33] <lacroix> berndj: I didn't read through all the details, but the impression I got is, it's something like this: when the path length is >1GiB, the code will malloc a block that's >2GiB (which is fine),
[16:38:37] <berndj> brouhaha
[16:38:52] <bruvvha> yea its an expression to describe the friend of the owner of a commodore
[16:39:00] <lacroix> berndj: but then it will pass that length to a function that accepts an `int` (so the >2GiB length becomes a large negative value) and then tries to *append* something to that buffer, causing it to write to an address that's start of the buffer minus ~2GiB.

[16:44:14] <lacroix> berndj: the (implicit) conversion from `size_t` converting a positive value to negative, causing some later pointer arithmetic to change a pointer that was *supposed* to be "buffer + <big number>" to be treated as if it was "buffer - <big number>" instead.
[16:44:37] *** Quits: dust (~dust@user/dust) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[16:46:35] <lacroix> berndj: On Linux and other of its kind, `int` is 32 bits and `long` is 64; on x86-64 Windows both `int` and `long` are 32 bits, and you have to go to `long long` for a 64-bit type.

[16:47:47] <hexnewbie> Kre10s: You can also give the filesystems on the drives the same label (or the partition, too)

[19:25:23] <TJ-> Guest62: if it is booting in UEFI mode then the bootable images need an EFI system partition with the bootloader at the removable media path in a FAT file-system  e.g. /EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI

This is likely due to my DNS setup with dnscrypt-proxy and dnsmasq but I can't figure out what. DNS won't work when I restart my system for a bit and will only start working after 10-20 minutes after the reboot or when I restart the service

[22:40:59] <rahl> uwharrie: thanks for the heads up re list bot

[22:44:37] <c705> the unix philospohy is do one thing, and do it well. my problem with systemd is it tries to be everything. it's the init system. it's the journal service. it's the udev service. I personally don't like it, but I admit that it does have it's benefits
[22:44:54] <yakiza> I've got a question for yall, I remember few years ago I wanted to create a bootable usb and for some reason dd was not cutting it for me and I had found a walkthough tutorial that I splitted the usb in 2 or 3 partitions  and once I did that It worked like a charm but I do not remember what I had searched in google to find that any clues?
[22:44:57] <c705> I've used systemd and openrc pretty extensively, and I prefer a slower but less complex init system. my choice
[22:45:05] <rahl> I have been using arch for some years now, always with systemd iirc, but it's not comfortable to talk about how to deal with arch if I just conceptually considered trying to remove systemd

[23:38:15] <hexnewbie> StarOffice (the Star Division one) shipped a graphical installer that simply installed the rpms with rpm, all while prompting you the same way a Windows installer would

[23:40:01] <Psi-Jack> hexnewbie: I do remember that! I got my official StarOffice CD from Sun because I downloaded Java on a day they were doing a convention.

[23:41:00] <dhrv> what is the secure way of storing files ? and accessing them across internet
[23:41:09] <jim> DynamiteDan, some dists with package managers, have extensive documentation on how to package (example, debian has a packaging manual that applies to .deb package files)
[23:41:17] <dhrv> these files happen to just some text files
[23:41:47] <DynamiteDan> okies. Thank you for the advices

[23:56:38] <Sauvin> If I understand this correctly, if you do NOT want ssh encryption over sshfs, you have to explicitly disable it.
[23:57:08] *** Joins: rudds (~rudds@user/rudds)
[23:57:25] <DLange> yes, but via the Internet you don't want unencrypted ssh
[23:57:47] <DLange> that's only an option in a trusted network where you need the last bit of data throughput
[23:58:11] <Sauvin> Yup! And it's dead simple to set up.
