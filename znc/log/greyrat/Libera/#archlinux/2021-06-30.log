[00:02:28] <lakiluki> Hey, I'm trying to use a tty session for some of my programming, but it seems that my tmux config + possibly my shell configuration + my vim configuration don't play along nicely
[00:02:44] <lakiluki> the thing is, when I start up vim for example without a tmux session, it mostly looks fine
[00:03:19] <lakiluki> however, when I do it inside of a tmux session, inside a tty - some colors seem to disappear and it all blends in weirdly (syntax highlighting also stops working)
[00:03:43] <lakiluki> this is not an issue only in vim, but all of the colors and some curses programs seem really weird
[00:04:02] <lakiluki> i tried the same thing with an empty tmux config, and it doesn't seem to help

[00:24:19] <swivel> so whenever it does an update it doesn't just stick it on sda or something... I had to shove an msata disk into this laptop and it's coming up as sda, with my nvme now at sdb... everything is working but I'm concerned next time I run pacman -Syu if grub gets updated it'll stick it in my msata and not the nvme I use for the OS

[00:26:53] <lakiluki> since those are unicode characters, I guess my question actually is - is there any way to support unicode inside a tty session?
[00:27:07] <MacGyver> swivel: Coming from Debian, there's two possible reasons to want your package manager to do things to your bootloader automatically, one of which is not a concern on Arch, the other might be.
[00:27:09] <swivel> MacGyver: i just wanted to ensure any scripts maintaining grub in an update would know to use the MBR @ sdb, but it sounds like no such automation is in play

[01:17:45] <Jerryeeee> you will see what i am talking about
[01:18:20] <swivel> Namarrgon: it says it's an xz file, but why is this important? it's a partial, nothing should be actually trying to make use of it

[01:19:51] <Namarrgon> Jerryeeee: decades ago
[01:19:59] <Jerryeeee> really
[01:20:10] <swivel> demonicmaniac: if pacman is using external xfer command, and wants to assume verything in that directory is usable, it should probably instruct xfer command to use a separate directory for partials

[01:44:52] <demonicmaniac> the main question here is - did pacman -Sc actually clean all not installed save for that .part or not
[01:45:11] <demonicmaniac> pacman -Sc doesn't say what it did clean or not and it's not clear from your error output if pacman -Sc did something or not
[01:45:29] <swivel> it spit out an error, not a warning, I assumed that interrupted the cleaning - maybe it's being skipped and actually working and is nothing more than a misleading message

[01:48:49] <swivel> the security argument is valid even if the security model assumes decompressors are not vulnerable, the vulnerability could be higher up the stack, let's say it passed lzma but exploited libarchive or some other metadata parse - the point is it's a partial file and *unverified* and you're attempting to do things with it

[02:31:59] <baltazar> not sure tbh :) I guess that it has more tools for developing code, e.g. debugging, running code
[02:31:59] <lantech19446> usually they have features that help with syntax and indentation as well as containing the ability to compile and possibly even run the code from within them

[02:35:03] <baltazar> (honestly my IDE will always be bash & vim/neovim)
[02:35:09] <eschwartz> an IDE has things like code completion as you type, or the ability to click a button / hit a hotkey and compile the entire program
[02:35:13] <mingdao> lantech19446: My question was just to whoever has eXPerience using an IDE.
[02:35:18] <grawity> so like if debugging involves :!gdb, that's not very integrated (vs being able to set breakpoints right in the editor)
[02:35:37] <eschwartz> but vim can do both -- LSP plugins exist, jedi-vim exists, YouCompleteMe exists...
[02:35:44] <eschwartz> and vim has :make
[02:35:46] <baltazar> grawity: :Termdebug

[03:48:13] <jaawerth> I like lua as a config language a lot better than viml, the main thing viml has is ecosystem. so I'd rather lua in nvim than vimscript 2 in vim9, though of course some of that depends on how the relative ecosystems develop

[04:08:17] <thrice> have you tried asking pacman what deps it would install, with the package that is in the repos? :>
[04:08:25] <lantech19446> I'm ok with using kde plasma especially if it gets me some extra functionality I'm not really liking gnome as much on arch as I did on Ubuntu anyway

[08:57:04] <mpan> !anyone
[08:57:05] <phrik> Quite possibly. Why do you ask?
[08:57:24] <thagoat> Just curious. I tried it a week or so ago and it failed
[08:59:29] <NetSysFire> "it failed" is very broad
[09:00:06] <NetSysFire> try again and go to #archinstall if you find issues
[09:00:26] <darkstardevx> Anybody else having issues with the gpg keyserver giving this error? gpg: keyserver refresh failed: No name. Haven't been on Arch in a while so i'm kinda behind and trying to do my updates. I tried changing the keyserver but it didn't work.
[09:00:39] <thagoat> Yep. lol Some python error I don't remember right now. Not looking for help, I prefer to not use it. Just striking up a chat
[09:01:04] <NetSysFire> Torxed_ is the one responsible for it but there is a reason the dedicated channel exists
[09:01:08] <NetSysFire> !give darkstardevx moar context
[09:01:09] <phrik> darkstardevx: moaarrr context!!! MMMOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRRR!!!
[09:01:14] <NetSysFire> is this the pacman keyring?

[09:05:30] <alschaapman> Isn't this related to some happening with SKS recently?
[09:05:35] <NetSysFire> yes
[09:05:44] <NetSysFire> make sure you use e.g the ubuntu keyservers
[09:05:48] <alschaapman> Okay, so that is a pacman keyring thing.
[09:06:16] <alschaapman> Does anyone have a link about the SKS thing? I tried searching around but I can't find anything relevant and I can't remember where I read about it
[09:07:00] <alschaapman> Thought it had something to do with European privacy laws and the write-only nature of the keyserver service meaning user information can't be removed
[09:07:07] <NetSysFire> !keyserver
[09:07:08] <phrik> Due to the SKS HKPS keyserver pool having disappeared, use the gpg option "--keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com" instead.

[13:20:01] <Namarrgon> astroanax: you can run X as root. you can run X as your user with an unprivileged X and you can run X as your user with a suid X

[14:32:52] <Grau> I'm using stereo headphones but also have a surround system. The headphones work fine on cable (I always used them with bluetooth on windows, which works in arch, too -kind of- but gets random disconnects/reconnects, but that's another problem). When I select 5.1 I get 5.0. The subwoofer is not working at all

[14:33:41] <Grau> I know

[17:46:19] <raster> well havent used one on my machines for many years. i got a new thunderx2 workstation at work when i joined now like about 3y ago and the nouveau drivers of course had issues. they were tearing and sometimes because filled with random vram junk. i just bought an amd gpu to replace it, fixed one kernel bug that was messing up cached vs uncached etc. ram mappings and then the amd worked like a charm after that.

[17:47:45] <Grau> Okay....AMD it is then.
[17:48:01] <raster> both drivers will want to control the same device and reality is that existing processes will be using the gpu - like the compositor .. and for that matter xorg itself
[17:48:16] <alad> Grau: with AMD the difference is your breakage is free and opensourced
[17:48:22] <raster> so if in theory you would unload the nvidia modules, load nouveau .. you would have to kill everything usng the gpu to release it at the kernel level

[17:54:40] <Grau> Oh, since my subwoofer is working now: Is it possible to creat a 2.1 profile that will be used by Clementine? I do want 5.1 in movies and games but I don't want my music upmixed.
[17:55:08] <raster> recently it was the oss nature of mesa that led me to find a problem in my code this way... i figured out WHY it was erroring thansk to that ... and it also turned out thgat mesa had unhandled error paths and was far too optimisitc about mmap() succeeding and it later trying to munmap the 0xffffffffffffffff address because mmap failed and no one checked this error and properly unwound :)
[17:55:29] <raster> i throw some patches over the wall at mesa - error handling code fixed, and my own code fixed too so i don't cause the error anymore :)

[19:56:18] <MacGyver> demonicmaniac: Sure but nvidia didn't have a ball to drop.

[19:58:06] <raster> in theory. i haven't tried and don't plan to.

[20:00:55] <raster> at least the logic is - if you are saving money you use the on-board gfx on your cpu/apu. you dont buy a gfx card. if you want the perf you may buy a cpu with no gpu and then buy a higher end gpu to match. if you choose to be neither of these markets.. you are very very very niche and not worth the effort to deal with product-wise

[20:27:33] <b0b> can someone please tell me: does pacman handle optdepends at all? in the sense that it can distinguish between dependencies and optdepends? as i understand it, for pacman a package is either asexplicit or asdeps but nothing else, is that correct?

[20:31:04] <mpan> Sure, pacman can mark packages only as installed explicitly or as a dependency. But that is unrelated to optdepends. And I can’t really see space for any other option, with those two being mutually exclusive and covering all possible cases.

[20:39:05] <alad> it can distinguish between optdepends and depends, it just can't automatically install optdepends
[20:39:06] <th0rne> You don't need to tell pacman that.
[20:39:06] <mpan> b0b: the question makes no sense. Please, provide the exact situation.

[20:39:35] <alad> i.e. no --install-suggests for you
[20:39:39] <mpan> optdepend is a package’s property, not an installed package’s property.
[20:40:02] <th0rne> If you install something without asdeps, you're installing it explicitly - it's what you want to install.
[20:40:02] <MacGyver> I think the question is asking about --don't-uninstall-optdeps, though?
[20:40:18] <baltazar> b0b: if that's what you're asking, it's not possible to know that a package is installed as an optional dependency for another package
[20:40:20] <mpan> Possibly, but that hasn’t been state.
[20:40:47] *** Quits: discape (~discape@user/discape) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:40:52] <th0rne> Non-optional dependencies pacman will install for you, so you don't need to do anything.
[20:40:54] <mpan> (it is, however, possible to know that it may be installed as an optdepend for anothe package)
[20:41:09] <MacGyver> As in, if a recursive uninstall of package A would remove dependency B, which is *also* an optdep for C, you can't tell pacman not to uninstall B based on that.
[20:41:10] <b0b> ah. so if i -Rs package A that has package B as optdepend, and B is installed asdeps, it _will_ be uninstalled too?
[20:41:34] <b0b> aah
[20:41:36] <b0b> thanks
[20:41:44] <mpan> b0b: only if package B is not installed as explicit.
[20:41:52] <b0b> yes
[20:42:03] <mpan> And if it’s installed as a dependency and is an optdepend (two separate concepts), you will be warned.
[20:42:05] <baltazar> and if no other package depends on B

[22:04:45] <NetSysFire> especially with crashes
[22:04:58] <NetSysFire> journald does some magic to keep the journal small enough

[22:14:46] <teraflops> heh
[22:15:19] <mpan> average_arch_use: keeping old logs should not increase flush time on boot. At least not alone.

[22:15:51] <mpan> 40GB — I smell the cause of the problems.
[22:16:00] <teraflops> yep
