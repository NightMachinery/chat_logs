[01:00:05] <edgar-rft> Caim: The running Emacs program only knows the modes that are currently activated, everything else only knows the internet.

[20:20:43] <bkhl> By adding the ability to bury stuff in threads noone can even discover I guess you make things even more effective by eliminating the need for anyone to even reading it?

[20:24:12] <bkhl> Well, there are situations where it's appropriate to use it or not.
[20:24:22] <bkhl> In my experience at least my colleagues are not good at realizing the difference.
[20:24:36] <grym> deciding where to semantically segment or not is up to you, yes
[20:24:54] <grym> but certainly i have regularly forking conversations with just one person 
[20:24:56] *** Quits: osfe (~lemaire@nanpc540.in2p3.fr) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[20:25:06] <bkhl> In particular we tend to have group chats for ongoing deployments and stuff where the whole point is having a chat channel for everyone to see what's going on.
[20:25:15] <JordiGH> grym: Because Alice and start a thread with Alice while talking to Bob and Bob won't notice that Alice started a thread with herself unless Bob goes up and looks up to where Alice might have started talking to herself.
[20:25:26] <grym> JordiGH: then you @ them there
[20:25:34] <bkhl> If people fork off in that it means you have to start thinking of whether to follow each thread.
[20:25:34] <grym> where you is Alice in that case 
[20:25:49] <JordiGH> You already get atted by everything in the DM.
[20:25:53] <grym> bkhl: people are going to fork _anyway_, it's just a question of how you represent it
[20:26:00] <bkhl> Sure.
[20:26:06] <JordiGH> If you're already looking at the DM you don't get atted again if I start talking to myself.
[20:26:14] <bpalmer> JordiGH: somebody put at-sign everything in the message?
[20:26:15] <grym> like, i grew up on IRC; i know how to segment a flat stream 
[20:26:23] <bkhl> The problem is if people can fork of and expect me to decide whether I need to follow a particular thread or not.
[20:26:27] <bpalmer> isn't it at-sign everybody ?
[20:26:52] <grym> but flat stream segregation relies on the semantics of nick highlighting, which (as i am doing right now) is often implicit 
[20:26:57] <JordiGH> bpalmer: People like to at in DMs in Slack but the DM itself already notifies. Atting again doesn't do anything.
[20:26:57] <bkhl> If they have to start a whole separate group chat for a subgroup or something, then they will be forced to explicitly invite me or not.
[20:27:01] <grym> in that sense, threads are more explicit
[20:27:52] *** Joins: runejuhl (~runejuhl@user/runejuhl)
[20:30:12] <bpalmer> I have a coworker who, in a chat with threads, regularly posts on the wrong thread. Thankfully it's not a very busy discussion.
[20:31:00] <grym> i have a slack team that has 3 members and one of them who is not me threads nearly every reply 
[20:31:01] <pjb> well, the UI is not the most clear.  I don't understand, we had the basis of nntp news readers, why can't they be at least as good?
[20:31:03] <grym> this is lunacy 
[20:31:26] <grym> it's so low traffic just reply in line it's fine 
[20:31:36] <wasamasa> no
[20:32:10] <grym> slack's "share message" thing is interesting as a thread alternative 
[20:32:25] <grym> since you can more or less bottom-quote things that way without a thread
[20:32:33] <bpalmer> It's a pity it's hard to do well, but this is honestly why I think reddit has proven itself to be a decent successor to usenet.
[20:33:02] <bpalmer> Conversations as trees are such a better model for how things work than either a single flat list or completely disconnected threads.
[20:33:06] <grym> i agree, reddit is pretty ergonomic
[20:33:15] <bpalmer> or, I suppose, a forest, because it's made of many trees.
[20:33:33] <grym> i've been on a reddit diet for a while though 
[20:34:01] <grym> i've mined the depths of its mediocrity to the point of diminishing returns for those hobbies i use it for

[23:08:57] <thblt> There's something weird with the way ERC colorizes nicks, because in my Emacs it makes most 4 letters nicks greenish, five is purplish, seven is gray… I wonder if that could be avoided.
[23:09:34] <thblt> There's a lot of greens in general, though.
[23:10:29] <bpalmer> there's some erc module out there which colorizes based on hash

[23:55:46] <gueorgui> Hi folks, I'm not sure what's the emacs way to think about how to accomplish this goal, would be grateful for advice: I'm searching for a term in a Projectile project using Vertico (`+vertico/project-search`) in order to refactor matching code. How would I go about saving the list of matches into a separate buffer so I can go through them one by one without having to search again? I hope this makes sense.
