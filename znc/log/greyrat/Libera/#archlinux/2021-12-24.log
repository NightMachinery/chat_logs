[00:22:43] <MacGyver> WHYYYY
[00:23:45] <MacGyver> So apparently what kodi does when it crashes, is, there's this single_stacktrace function that searches the filesystem for files matching the pattern "core*", read them, grep them for being an existing kodi coredump, and then add to that file.
[00:24:13] <MacGyver> And that gets called, among other things, on $HOME with a max-depth of 5. FIVE.
[00:24:45] <ectospasm> That'll take five-ever!

[01:44:15] <Forsaken87> yes, i do
[01:44:31] <MacGyver> Forsaken87: So what's going on here, the fe80 addresses are link-local, and you *always* need to specify the interface they need to use, and using them also *never* passes router boundaries.

[03:37:01] <Forsaken87> running
[03:37:05] <MacGyver> Yeah okay.
[03:37:18] <Forsaken87> so it's not the router after all? :O
[03:37:41] <MacGyver> It might be.
[03:37:44] <MacGyver> Sec.
[03:37:52] <MacGyver> Figuring out what 2a02:908:1800:6:1570:badc:dfae:60c4 is likely to be.
[03:38:21] <Forsaken87> How did your server receive the packets then? :D Or does the router only block the replys towards my pc?
[03:38:27] <MacGyver> The latter.
[03:38:38] <MacGyver> *I* am getting ICMPv6 destination unreachables when trying to reply to your ping.
[03:38:49] <Forsaken87> huh
[03:38:50] <MacGyver> From that address.
[03:38:57] <bea> pings to both addresses die at 60c4 for me
[03:39:22] <bea> which is hmmmm
[03:39:26] <MacGyver> And tracing to that address puts it in unity-media's network.
[03:39:43] <MacGyver> Might be the router's public-facing IPv6.
[03:40:27] <bea> you get a /64 ... but then its NAT'd?
[03:40:33] <MacGyver> No, not NAT'ed.
[03:40:38] <MacGyver> I saw the correct source addresses.
[03:40:47] <MacGyver> But for one of them, the router just claims it can't reach it.
[03:41:11] <MacGyver> So firewall shenanigans or NDP shenanigans.

[03:41:29] <Forsaken87> I just whispered you my routers public ipv6
[03:42:37] <Forsaken87> MacGyver: So the router is blocking the reply (not my ISP itself), right?
[03:42:48] <MacGyver> The router isn't exactly blocking the reply.
[03:42:58] <MacGyver> It's dropping it, claiming it can't reach the destination address.
[03:43:23] <MacGyver> (Blocking implies a rejection based on firewall rules, which this doesn't seem to be)
[03:43:53] <Forsaken87> Isn't that what happens if you create a iptable drop rule?
[03:44:14] <MacGyver> Then I wouldn't receive an ICMPv6 destination unreachable.
[03:44:17] <MacGyver> I'd just not see anything.
[03:44:23] <Forsaken87> (which is what I usually do if someone spamms my server from a specific ip)
[03:44:38] <Forsaken87> huh weird
[03:44:41] <NetSysFire> drop is evil
[03:45:02] <NetSysFire> rejecting it is just better for debugging, bonus point if you use --reject-with and use something sane
[03:45:32] <MacGyver> I don't know *why* the router thinks it can't reach that address though.

[03:49:16] <Forsaken87> is the /128 from SLAAC or DHCPv6?

[03:49:42] <MacGyver> Your pi's /128 works, your other machine's /64 works.

[04:21:03] <Feuermagier> MacGyver, I took a closer look at the display configuration setting of KDE. Managed to enable them there. Apparently they were marked as "disabled". Huge Thx!

[12:06:07] <Betal> dostoyevsky2: you don't need dxvk-bin at all if you download dxvk from winetricks or dxvk zip from upstream and use it in wine-prefixes you need
[12:06:08] <GuiToris> jelle, alright, as soon as I have a little time, I wil :)
[12:06:11] <dostoyevsky2> novns: Well, have fun spending years of manually installing recursive depdencies from AUR then
[12:06:13] <jelle> GuiToris: cool!
[12:06:36] <novns> dostoyevsky2, with exact versions, no auto updates
[12:07:32] <novns> because things can break in AUR when you look the other way
[12:07:53] <novns> AUR is not a thing to trust blindly
[12:08:10] <Betal> dostoyevsky2: vulkan-bin have no dependency at all anyway
[12:08:15] <dostoyevsky2> novns: `yay -S --noconfirm dxvk-bin' alone runs for like 20mins... it's pulling like 200 packages... I seriously doubt that you'd ever be able to do that with makepkg...  You'd just give up in the process, and by the time you'd be finished your build would be stale
[12:08:42] <Betal> dostoyevsky2: looks you need to read the PKGBUILD or check what this package is
[12:08:55] <Betal> there is nothing to do with this package, almost 0 cpu power for it
[12:09:01] <novns> dostoyevsky2, you can use some other distro in your dockerfile, where those packages aer easily installed
[12:09:10] <novns> *are

[12:09:20] <dostoyevsky2> novns: What is the preferred distro for wine?
[12:09:44] <jelle> it would be much more awesome if someone packaged dxvk for archlinux ;-)
[12:09:45] <novns> dostoyevsky2, I would check ubuntu first, it's heavily tested

It only happens when I have linux-headers installed (running 5.15.11-arch2-1 on a T14 Gen 2 w/ Ryzen 7 5850u) so I'm assuming it has to do w/ an amd driver or something.

[23:22:43] <switchnode> after last system upgrade (including linux 5.15.8arch1-1 -> 5.15.11arch2-1 and xorg-server 21.1.2-1 -> 21.1.2-2, but not xclip or pass), `pass -c` now hangs instead of copying the relevant password to the clipboard, even though `pass show` and `xclip -i` both work fine. has anyone heard of this issue?
[23:23:32] <randomxusr> semiote, I'll try using pavucontrol. Lspci shows both Nvidia TU116 (guessing for hdmi) and AMD Device 16637
[23:23:43] <semiote> you might just need to enable the right mode and find the right jack to use on your motherboard if you're using a simple 3.5mm motherboard microphone connection.

[23:28:55] <semiote> in pavucontrol under the configuration tab, you'll find the modes for each of your devices. might be less relevant if you're dealing with a laptop internal microphone that has no external port.
[23:29:21] <semiote> profiles, they're called in the ui
[23:29:31] <semiote> there's selection options for each of the input/output sinks on their respective tabs too.

[23:38:09] <semiote> for the easiest setup it's probably best to install pulseaudio-alsa and have pulseaudio manage your devices.
