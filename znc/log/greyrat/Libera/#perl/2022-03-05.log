[02:42:03] <Botje> i'm sure some golfer is really happy with that behavior too
[02:43:10] <kjetilho> e.g., tr/a-z/_/ would be super annoying

[02:44:05] <kjetilho> blah.  you know what I mean
[02:59:22] <gordonfish> EvanCarroll: Well, tr is normally supposed to replace each character with a corrasponding character on the other wise, so the two lists normally need to be of equal length, giving a 1:1 replacement.
[02:59:35] <gordonfish> Also it's what tr(1) does as well
