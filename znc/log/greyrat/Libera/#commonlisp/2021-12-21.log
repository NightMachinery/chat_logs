[00:29:30] <Bike> utis: for standard hash tables you don't specify a hash function. are you using a library or extension?
[00:29:34] <marcoxa> utis: hash-tables (unfortunately) only accept EQ, EQL (the default), EQUAL and EQUALP.  These four cover most cases, including strings and Josh_2 ponted out.
[00:30:12] <marcoxa> Weeeeeel... maybe no so "unfortunately".
[00:31:07] <fiddlerwoaroof> I wonder how many implementations extend hash tables here
[00:31:11] <fiddlerwoaroof> SBCL has sb-ext:define-hash-table-test
[00:31:23] <Bike> that said, string-equal and equalp coincide on strings anyway
[00:34:06] <fiddlerwoaroof> https://github.com/metawilm/cl-custom-hash-table#implementation-details
[00:34:23] <fiddlerwoaroof> Probably don't use that, though :)
[00:34:36] <fiddlerwoaroof> At least, don't use it if the default set of tests works
[00:38:11] <semz> I don't really get the design of this library. Why codewalking?
[00:39:26] <utis> well, i want to use symbols, but that gets me into trouble when i try to supply the symbols from another package
[00:41:17] <semz> You can specify a package, e.g. 'foo:sym, 'bar:sym instead of 'sym
[00:41:19] <utis> if i understood weitz, it's possible to use a custom test if one also supplies a hash function?
[00:41:21] <semz> Or keywords

[00:44:55] <marcoxa> utis: in general you need to supply a test AND a hash function; they go together.  However, in CL you do not have control over SXHASH.  Implementations (I'll name the sin, but not the sinner) have been known t returns something like ... 42 upon calls to (SXHASH some-random-struct).
[00:48:14] <marcoxa> As an example, Java is very clear about how you should specialize hashCode() and equals() methods together.

[02:24:29] <Guest74> Is there a function to remove a specific position from a sequence?
[02:25:26] <Bike> nope. there are some ways one can hack it up
[02:26:58] <Guest74> yeah, i'm using start and end, but just wondering.
[02:35:29] <_death> (remove-if (constantly t) '(a b c d e) :start 2 :end 3)
[02:36:06] <Guest74> my goto is if-not #'null
[02:36:41] <Bike> unlike deaths, that is sensitive to the actual contents of the sequence, isn't it?
[02:38:09] <Bike> if you have nil at that position it wouldn't actually be removed.
[02:39:50] <Guest74> I'm not sure I've ever used nil in a sequence.  and i tend to only use it when I have odd stuff in the sequence.
[02:39:58] <Nilby> The constantly version also seems to get optimized quite well.
[02:40:45] <Bike> does it?

[02:42:48] <Guest74> except #'null is handed to it.
[02:43:13] <Bike> no matter what you're going to be allocating a new sequence of variable length and copying into it
[02:43:14] <Nilby> I was expecting it could just do the list splice, but I guess not
[02:43:42] <Bike> i don't believe remove is permitted to have its result share structure with the input

[14:33:07] *** Quits: igemnace (~ian@user/igemnace) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:33:44] <Guest36> So I want to figure something out. Class C inherits from Class A and B. Class A1 is "effectively" class A but with a particular value for one of its slots. I created A1 to allow me to specialise some methods
[14:34:12] <rotateq> do you have code to bring on a pasteboard?
[14:34:44] <Guest36> Damn I'm confused
[14:34:51] <beach> rotateq: So far, even I can follow it. :)
[14:34:53] <Guest36> Ignore me. Let me think some more :-/
[14:35:07] <rotateq> oh hm
[14:35:21] <Guest36> I basically want a method on class C, but specialising based on the values within its slots
[14:35:27] <rotateq> beach: oh what did i say? and no, you're the absolut expert here :)

[14:36:11] <beach> Guest36: You can't use the value in a slot as a specializer.
[14:36:34] <beach> Guest36: You can use a class or a particular value (with EQL).
[14:36:56] <Guest36> Yes, I got to that. So I decided to "create" class A1 so that I could create methods that specialise on A1
[14:37:06] <Guest36> But the problem is C inherits froM A and not A1

[16:29:23] <VincentV`>  rotateq: RE: /CLOS and what they have in other galaxies/. So I have recently learned about garnet, and it has prototype OO called KR. Prototype OO is argued by some to be more flexible than class-based OO. The basic premise is that instead of classes you simply clone objects -- while setting slot values, adding/(removing?) slots, the whole inheritence deal etc. The inflection point is: you don't have to specify types of the new object
[16:29:23] <VincentV`>  (particularly in garnet, you have to set :is-a slot, every object is of type "schema"; I don't know how if other such systems do it better). So, this seems to be more dynamic. But then, again, I wonder how well it bodes for performance (e.g. you can't do gradual typing on these in particular, but, in principle, you could probably find a way to do it).
[16:29:36] <VincentV`>  So, this discussion here lists some pros/cons: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/110936/what-are-the-advantages-of-prototype-based-oop-over-class-based-oop
[16:29:43] <VincentV`>  Even though not all of these points are relevant against something like CLOS (e.g. changing behaviour at runtime is supported pretty damn well in CLOS, and I bet it's more robust with change-class), it does make you wonder. Maybe even some sort of a system where you can go from one to another (ie gradual) could be the next most alien(ating) thing on the line.
[16:30:11] <rotateq> VincentV`: oh cool and yes, much to discover and combine powerful ideas

[17:33:28] <engblom> When it comes to nosql databases, I think berkeleydb would be a really good option if the CL library would just be worked on a bit. What I like with berkeleydb is how everything is pairs (a bit like a alist) and both the key and the value can be of any native type in any programming language.
[17:33:43] <engblom> You never have to translate between different types.
[17:34:06] <rotateq> at CERN they also use couchdb
[17:34:42] <rotateq> there's a CL tool pgloader or so for SQL databases, to bring them to postgresql with one click

[22:02:12] <Bike> the perhaps silly way that i think about it is that generic functions can't specialize on their return type.
[22:03:07] <lisp123> Bike: I see, that kinda makes sense
[22:05:36] <Bike> the bit on this post in map sums it up: "Common Lisp does not allow map to deduce its return type based off the surrounding context", and indeed that's kind of a nonsensical proposition with the semantics of the language
[22:05:45] <Bike> whereas in haskell or coalton or whatever that's no problem
[22:06:03] <lisp123> But wouldn't the return type be contingent upon the inputs to a function so one should just create distinct generic functions, depending on the input?
[22:06:54] <Bike> for map the return type is not continent on the inputs to the function (other than the specifier input). you can map a list to a vector, a list to a list, whatever.
[22:07:13] <lisp123> true
[22:07:30] <lisp123> ok that's starting to make a bit of sense
[22:07:48] <Bike> in the example in this blog post, you could also consider how "identity" would work as a generic function
[22:08:08] <Bike> ...it wouldn't, since it doesn't actually have any arguments. the only thing to "dispatch on" is the context

[22:11:01] <lisp123> The bit about specialising on return type, would that be more useful when coercing from one type to another? I saw mention something of that in the post, so that kinda makes sense to me
[22:11:11] <Bike> that's also in the post, yes
[22:11:39] <Bike> Consider the lisp form (+). that is defined to be an integer 0. If you write (+ 3.7 (+)), what that means (prior to optimization) is that you call +, that returns integer 0, that's coerced to a single float, and then added to the float 3.7
[22:12:16] <Bike> + is "not aware" of its context in a floating point computation

[22:16:21] <yitzi> Seems like if you were actually trying to implement an algebra with generic functions you could just accomplish this by specializing on a "group" or "field" instance.
[22:16:31] <yitzi> That would basically be the same thing.
[22:17:04] <Bike> sure, people do that. and actually i think that's how coalton implements typeclasses under the hood.
[22:17:15] <Bike> means passing some more arguments around, though.
[22:17:53] <yitzi> I think that is what Weyl did. (Lisp based algebra).
