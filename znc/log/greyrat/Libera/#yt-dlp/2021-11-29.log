[17:03:09] <pabs3> eqw: that video works for me with both youtube-dl and yt-dlp
[17:08:30] <eqw> pabs3: maybe facebook gives you different different version, and I get the later version. Another weird thing about facebook is that right-click on the video in browser doesn't work.
[17:09:00] <pabs3> perhaps
