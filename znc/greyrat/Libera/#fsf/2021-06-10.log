[14:42:16] <damo22> the linux kernel interfaces change all the time, how can you keep up with a compatible interface?? 
[14:46:06] <damo22> "kline: aggi, gnu hurd does not provide a drop-in replacement for linux with compatible interfaces, which is somewhat annoying. why?"  hurd is a microkernel model, it is not supposed to have any drivers inside its mach kernel, the drivers are all supposed to be processes in userspace
[14:48:04] <damo22> if someone wants to write a userspace unikernel framework / wrapper for linux then we can use liblinux in hurd but currently no one is working on that, so we are using rumpkernel from netbsd drivers
[14:54:10] <aggi> i was thinking of the syscall interface, more than 320 syscalls, and interfaces downwards to hardware is another story, equally worrying
[14:54:57] <aggi> it is only coincidence i had noticed gentoo wiki mentioned *bsd kernel are not supported as drop-in replacement anymore, leave alone what GNU Hurd project could achieve
[14:55:21] <damo22> i think hurd uses upstream glibc these days

[14:56:29] <damo22> the beauty of hurd is that the kernel is tiny and has very minimal jobs to do: manage memory, provide a message bus for inter-process communication and restrict access to certain i/o
[14:59:36] <damo22> hurd is missing drivers for hardware and i dont have much time to work on it, although ive almost replaced the in-kernel disk driver with a userspace pci one

[15:04:34] <aggi> i remain sceptical if it is a strategically relevant choice to support Hurd on x86 hardware anyway
[15:05:10] <aggi> damo22: maybe, some radical approach was more appropriate, such as tailoring hardware for Hurd, i was thinking about j-core.org occasionally
[15:06:02] <damo22> probably yeah, that would be cool
[15:06:27] <aggi> add to this the situation with compilers, if something radical as GNU Hurd was approached, then i wouldn't recognise GCC as a viable option anymore either
[15:07:04] <damo22> what situation with compilers? do you mean gcc/ llvm
[15:07:09] <aggi> both
[15:07:27] <damo22> i like gcc because its gpl
[15:08:06] <damo22> we need a gpl toolchain to protect all gpl software
[15:08:15] <aggi> of cause
[15:08:48] <aggi> i wouldn't blame GNU for the situation anyway, if they are forced by the industry, to implement yet another frontend, such as rust recently
[15:09:15] <damo22> from the technical side, i cant speak to it, as i dont write compilers
[15:09:18] <aggi> or interfaces downwards to support hundreds of CISC simd voodoo
[15:10:11] <aggi> i studied telco engineering 20 years ago, and have had enough of this anyway
[15:10:26] <damo22> i feel perhaps people working on toolchains are being paid to work on their hobby by an employer
[15:10:55] <damo22> so there is always need to release a new version
[15:11:23] <damo22> rather than write a stable compiler for a long term release

[23:42:20] <asdflkj_sh> odoood: well there are >500 people in ##rust if you want to hear what they have to say (although rust has a reputation for rabid rustacean fanboys, they even have a name, the Rust Evangelism Strike Force)
[23:43:01] <odoood> i get the feeling it won't be an unbiased source
[23:43:32] <odoood> so might wait on that 
[23:44:43] <asdflkj_sh> true, but OTOH there's no such thing as an unbiased source
[23:47:25] <odoood> yea - but like with anything when I'm looking at its "ratings" I like to see what's the worst ppl say first
[23:48:10] <odoood> if that doesn't bother me then at least not an automatic rejection lol
