[07:39:18] <Jong> How would you have stated this? "Reading requires my mind to go through the steps: visual symbol -> work spoken silently to myself -> meaning."
[07:39:18] *** solveig is now known as feainnewedd
[07:39:47] <Jong> The part "to through the steps" is what I'm most iffy about.  What's a better word for "iffy" btw
[07:39:52] <Jong> unsure?
[07:40:28] <CuriosTiger> "iffy" has several meanings. unsure or uncertain is one of them. Questionable or untrustworthy are two others.
[07:40:52] <CuriosTiger> It can even mean dangerous. Ie. "that neighborhood is iffy after dark."
[07:41:03] <CuriosTiger> Going through steps is fine.
[07:41:05] <Jong> most unconfident, most bugging me, most problematic
[07:41:21] <CuriosTiger> I think you mean "word spoken" rather than "work spoken".
[07:41:49] <CuriosTiger> And if I were writing this, I'd say "Reading requires my mind to go through the following steps:" -- but that is a question of style, not correctness.
[07:41:49] <Jong> yes I did
[07:42:06] <Jong> I wish there was an AI on MacOS that would highlight typos for me
[07:42:13] <CuriosTiger> and rather than "meaning", I might use the word "comprehension".
[07:42:38] <CuriosTiger> There is. However, it's not smart enough to catch correctly spelled words used incorrectly.
[07:42:46] <Jong> Also I wish there was an entire-sentence thesaurus AI that would present alternative ways to say the same thought
[07:43:08] <Jong> Ever wanted to say something but not matter what sentence you thought of, it didn't quite say what you wanted?

[12:23:18] <mdogg> Voxel: That sentence doesn't make much sense.  Are you relaying something that somebody else asked?
[12:30:06] <mdogg> It sounds like the question has to do with whether someone who uses excessive slurs (I infer that as offensive language) should first be warned that their behavior is unacceptable, or whether they should be banned immediately for a period of 1-hour.  Is that right?
[12:31:40] <inhahe_> i'm not sure what it's asking either, but i know that 'in case when' should be either 'when' or 'in case', not both
[12:31:51] <inhahe_> and 'i.e.' should be 'e.g.'
[12:32:03] <inhahe_> and '1 hour' should be '1 hour ago'

[12:53:18] <blkshp> However, I think my car could take it as it was designed there and I'd take it for the price difference.
[12:53:49] <mdogg> What octane is your lowest?
[12:53:52] <mdogg> Ours is 87
[12:53:54] <blkshp> 95
[12:55:01] <mdogg> Our highest in 98% of gas stations is 91.  We have to go to speciality stations if we want higher than that in California.  As you get into the northern part and the eastern portion of the U.S., though, the highest standard octane rating is 93.
[12:55:14] <mdogg> (expect for specialty stations)
[12:55:32] <blkshp> I put 99 in usually.

[12:56:57] <blkshp> I'll probably switch to E10 when i get the new one
[12:57:02] <mdogg> I used to put 91 in my Tacoma all the time until about 4 years ago when California added another gasoline tax.  Now I'm using 87.  It did run better on the higher octane.
[12:58:47] <mdogg> Diesel is a bit more than $1USD more expensive than petrol now.  I still think about getting a diesel if I end up buying another pickup because the engine is built better and gets much better milage. 
[12:58:51] <mdogg> millage.
[12:59:25] <blkshp> my new one isn't a mustang but it's a 1.5 engine but it's 182bhp but I have never had a petrol with a turbo before so I'll just do some testing to see what it runs like on the different types but as it's new it's probably much better on higher ethanol so I will switch to the 95 E10 and see how that runs
[13:00:49] <mdogg> Oh, if you have a turbo then you'll want to use higher octane.  I used to have an MR2 Turbo and the manual said it required at least 91 octane.  But since your lowest is 95 then you shouldn't have anything to worry about.
[13:01:03] <mdogg> Turbos and supercharged engines have higher compression.
[13:01:33] <blkshp> I'll see what the price difference is and what the MPG is on this car
[13:03:25] <mdogg> If you force air into the cylinder and the gasoline that is being used is too low, the gasoline could ignite prematurely (before the piston has fully compressed the fuel) and there is a risk that you blow out your rings or rods..   Basically there's a chance that things won't end well..
[13:04:02] <mdogg> Just look in your manual - it should say the minimum octane rating (or, sometimes a minimum octane number which are different).
[13:04:34] <mdogg> For example, a minimum octane number of 96 is equivalent to an octane rating of 91.
[13:08:41] <mdogg> blkshp: You know what?  We may actually have the same octane.  It might just be just the way Europe and the US index it that's different.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane_rating

[13:09:06] <blkshp> xD
[13:11:20] <mdogg> Yeah - your 97 is what we would call 92/93 octane.

[13:19:00] <mdogg> Kelvin would be better than Fahrenheit, too.

[13:21:11] <mdogg> Well, at least we don't have yellow headlights.
[13:21:11] <pussipupu> Everyone should drive on the right because boats pass port to port
[13:21:12] <blkshp> And they originally drove on the left.
[13:21:24] <pussipupu> and boats are better than cars anyway
[13:21:48] <blkshp> But londoners walk on the right and that's not how we make cars do things!
[13:22:07] <blkshp> (it's as relevant as boats! :P)
[13:23:04] <mdogg> We need boats.  Well, ships anyway..
[13:23:13] <blkshp> I don't.
[13:23:54] <mdogg> And I'm getting out of the way regardless of which side I'm on if a cargo ship is heading towards me.
[13:24:36] <mdogg> Sometimes I hear people say "irregardless".  It makes my skin crawl. 
[13:25:14] <blkshp> Well people are going to say it irregardless of your feelings :P
[13:25:21] <mdogg> Don't I know it.
[13:25:48] <pussipupu> I heard that a lot just after famous person said it and now almost never
[13:26:00] <pussipupu> I think it was a president 
[13:26:13] <mdogg> Probably.

[13:27:06] <mdogg> Some speak better than others.  Just like normal people.  
[13:27:41] <pussipupu> Bush very much plays a role though as well
[13:28:50] <mdogg> H.W. Bush spoke very will.  His son on the other hand, should have just stuck to the script.
[13:31:30] <mdogg> I can handle speaking to a team of 30 people whom I've worked with for some time, but I have to admit that I don't do very well speaking in front of 30 people whom I've never met before. 
[13:31:54] <mdogg> Unless I'm just reading something.
[13:32:01] <mdogg> I'm not myself..

[13:38:22] <mdogg> In a position like that, though, you need to at least *present* as confident and competent.  People who go into politics can't say, "Gee, I didn't know I was going to have to convince people to support me by speaking publicly."

[21:43:13] <TimMc> It's basically up to blkshp, but I think he's fine with those kinds of contractions. Mainly he gets annoyed at text-speech like "ur" for "your", not capitalizing, and not punctuating sentences.
[21:46:26] <TimMc> Singular-they has been broadly accepted in English for a long time now.

[23:03:08] <xau> In my view you can safely disregard them.
[23:03:59] <xau> Due to the stylistic superiority of the second formulation.

[23:08:19] <csi123> Why is "due to" + gerund better than "because" + past tense?
[23:09:39] <TimMc> deya: In the first paragraph I'd replace "cover" with "covers" or "covered" (number mismatch); "must know" with "must-know" (making it an adjective); "this will be again like" with "this will again be in the form of" (just a style suggestion).
[23:10:06] <TimMc> "spread on different locations" -> "spread among..."
[23:10:36] <TimMc> (although I'm not sure how that relates to remote jobs)
[23:11:22] <TimMc> "applicable on" -> "applicable to" (first one wasn't exactly wrong, but second is better)

[23:11:37] <xau> It feels to me more like what a cultivated English speaker would say, csi123.  I would say it that way.  I wouldn't count it against anyone if they said it the other way.

[23:16:54] <csi123> Does "being" belong there?   The Italian police arrested 14 or 15 people from four of Lidl's offices during investigation into ties with the Laudani crime family. The four offices, being in charge of 200 stores, were placed under state control for six months.
