[23:11:24] <rvalue> does youtube-dl work on youtube live streams?
[23:11:58] <opal> have you tried it
[23:12:36] <rvalue> i subscribe to a creator who creates great content and he takes good care of muting the audio when he thinks it might be copyrighted but i guess even with best efforts the video gets taken down when the stream ends
[23:13:16] <rvalue> @opal: i will trying next time when he streams but just wanted to know if it works
