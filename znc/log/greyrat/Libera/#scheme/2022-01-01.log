[04:26:25] <amazigh> Spawns_Carpeting: I have a very minimal scheme that compiles to JavaScript
[04:26:28] <amazigh> would that help?

[04:27:28] <amazigh> the code is at https://git.sr.ht/~amirouche/ruse-javascript
[04:27:32] <amazigh> let me check the code
[04:28:15] <tatsumaru> hey guys, i just read that openAI's GPT-3 is capable of translating source code from one programming language to another. does this mean that someone could write a scheme and just translate all the python libs they need into said scheme in order to get fast traction with that language?
[04:28:42] <aeth> no
[04:28:45] <amazigh> Spawns_Carpeting: that is the interesting file and branch: https://git.sr.ht/~amirouche/ruse-javascript/tree/wasm2/item/scratch.scm
[04:29:17] <aeth> tatsumaru: even if that claim was true, it would only work on the most popular programming languages. There isn't even one "Scheme", there's dozens of incompatible dialects.
[04:29:32] <aeth> tatsumaru: Just like how machine learning isn't too good at translating to/from Latin
[04:29:41] <amazigh> Spawns_Carpeting: go through this https://github.com/akeep/scheme-to-c
[04:30:25] <tatsumaru> aeth: but you could hypothetically translate from one language that doesn't have guaranteed bytecode compatibility like python into something like java that has guaranteed bytecode compatibility for use with clojure?
[04:30:30] <aeth> (Actually, Scots would be a better analogy because it checks both boxes: relatively obscure and dozens of incompatible dialects instead of a uniform language)
[04:31:40] <amazigh> btw LiSP is not super great read imo, could not finish it.
[04:31:49] <amazigh> not anymore at least.
[04:31:53] <aeth> tatsumaru: cleaning up subtle mistakes in machine-generated code (which isn't a new thing) is probably going to take about as long as translating it by hand
[04:32:05] <aeth> "better" AI just makes the mistakes more subtle
[04:32:12] <aeth> but without strong AI you're not going to get it to be flawless

[04:32:40] <tatsumaru> i see, thanks
[04:32:47] <aeth> imo of course
[04:32:51] <amazigh> +1
[04:33:48] <aeth> the way you generally translate a library is gradually, with runtime compatibility
[04:33:52] <aeth> e.g. C/C++
[04:33:56] <aeth> afaik
[04:34:06] <aeth> (that is, slowly turning C into C++ is easy)
[04:36:14] <amazigh> they are companies specialising in translating C to C++ or Cobol to Java
[04:36:37] <amazigh> I know one company that does that
[04:36:49] <amazigh> never seen the work done first hand
[04:37:22] <tatsumaru> if you are doing it by hand like that isn't it simply easier to just write it from scratch?
[04:37:36] <amazigh> it is not done by hand but by a program
[04:37:46] <amazigh> apparantly no. That's what the company claims.
[04:38:39] <amazigh> The thing with COBOL is nobody learns it anymore, so it is apparantly better to grab a progoram translate it to Java, and I guess fix the Java code
[04:39:48] <tatsumaru> amazigh: did you know that most of US money runs on cobol mainframes? banks/federal reserve

[05:05:46] <Zipheir> LiSP is a very hard recommendation.  Not at all a book for getting started implementing Scheme, IMO.
[05:06:22] <Zipheir> Ah, here it is.
[05:06:25] <Zipheir> Spawns_Carpeting: http://michaux.ca/articles/scheme-from-scratch-introduction
[05:07:08] <Zipheir> That's what I learned from when trying to understand Scheme interpreters in lower-level languages.
[05:10:32] <s-liao> Zipheir is possible to remove r7rs dependence from srfi-207 implementation?
[05:14:30] <Zipheir> s-liao: Yes, but it would be a lot of work.  We would have to replace all of the bytevector-* stuff with u8vector-* equivalents.  So the egg would depend on srfi-160, then, probably.
[05:14:52] <Zipheir> The r7rs egg has good support from the CHICKEN developers, too.
[05:15:45] <Zipheir> s-liao: Why do you want to get rid of the r7rs dep.?

[05:25:35] <s-liao> Zipheir one more question, have you been coding on js before?
[05:27:29] <s-liao> I saw your code. the function signature you have, it has "undefined"  such this.
[05:28:27] <s-liao> It likes you have such experience on the JavaScript.
[05:28:34] <Zipheir> s-liao: I rarely write any JS.  'undefined' is what (chicken type) calls "the unspecifed value".
[05:28:59] <Zipheir> So, for-each, display, etc. all return "undefined" in CHICKEN.
[05:29:36] <s-liao> Yes. it is.
[05:30:17] <Zipheir> I don't think it's a good name.  Usually when something is "undefined', things blow up or demons fly out of your nose.
[05:30:34] <s-liao> I was learning JS for a while like a month ago. I messed up with it.
[05:31:37] <amazigh> undefined in js is not a good habit
[05:31:44] <amazigh> either, same as scheme
[05:32:43] <Zipheir> s-liao: Did you like it?
[05:32:50] <Zipheir> amazigh: Undefined or unspecified?
[05:34:18] <Zipheir> Unspecified values are very common in Scheme (somewhat unfortunately, IMO).
[05:39:27] <s-liao> I thought that your guys have experience on JavaScript, I am trying to figure out to build the portal  like https://caniuse.com/  for scheme knowedge
[05:42:56] <s-liao> Undefined is Okay. I have not thought too much. As before I was coding in the java. I can not figure out one value, it is not null and  "" , but representation undefined case. Maybe that is it. or Unspecified Undefined .
[05:44:54] <Zipheir> I know there are many, many people in #scheme with JS knowledge.  Some might be willing to help out.
[05:46:41] <s-liao> Yes.
[05:48:11] <Zipheir> There's also https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Scheme_Programming , which I mean to get (back) to work on sometime soonish.
[05:48:20] <s-liao> It like https://caniuse.com/flexbox-gap, we come into one srfi or one feature, all the knowledge for user to easy navigate
[05:50:45] <s-liao> And the different release in each implementation as well.
[05:54:25] <amazigh> sorry, I am confusing.
[05:55:13] <s-liao> ?
[05:56:55] <s-liao> Yes, amazigh you have pre-srfi about the web UI before.
[05:57:37] <s-liao> Do you have some recommend for building the portal like https://caniuse.com/  for scheme knowedge
[05:58:08] <s-liao> or suggestion.
[05:59:10] <amazigh> s-liao: I started one, with chicken-spock
[05:59:29] <Zipheir> Good use for spock.
[05:59:46] <amazigh> but honestly, the best use of our time regarding portable stuff, I think is getting together portable libraries or programs.
[06:00:05] <amazigh> (and possibly a linter)
[06:00:25] <amazigh> I am not even sure what do to, I promised myself, not to make plans this year, and just code.
[06:01:07] <amazigh> I mean, we had enough high level libraries in scheme-live, it would be clear what is portable
[06:01:44] <amazigh> And push piece wise stuff to SRFI when we feel it is ready.
[06:02:00] <amazigh> somewhat superseeding the pre-srfi org
[06:02:59] <amazigh> I started with another JSON library supported by 12 scheme :>
[06:03:17] <s-liao> That is cool.
[06:03:53] <amazigh> :)
[06:04:07] <amazigh> but it is still fuzzy what the point is
[06:04:20] <amazigh> (I take the risk to say that even if it might be a downer)
[06:04:52] <Zipheir> Hey, it's a new year.  No downers, please.
[06:05:17] <amazigh> 2022 is the year of scheme... in the editor!
[06:05:34] <s-liao> Can I stupid question about json library?
[06:05:39] <amazigh> sure
[06:05:45] <amazigh> there is not stupid question.
[06:05:50] <s-liao> Why I rarely see the validation for json file?
[06:05:52] <amazigh> s/not/no/
[06:06:11] <amazigh> like XML schemas?
[06:06:20] <s-liao> Yes.
[06:06:26] <amazigh> ah
[06:06:55] <amazigh> Sure thing validation is required. I rarely see it either
[06:07:35] <amazigh> The point of XML / JSON Schema is to avoid everybody rolling their own validation machinery
[06:07:45] <amazigh> basically factoring and making it easier to interop
[06:08:38] <amazigh> The thing is there is less *big* JSON schemas to validate, everything is ad-hoc
[06:09:18] <amazigh> unlike XML, they started from the start that they wanted to have various documents that conform to a particular schema, hence the need from the start for a shared validation logic
[06:09:18] <s-liao> When are we talking xml/html. they always are talking validation for them.
[06:09:52] <amazigh> That is what I try to explain, there is little interop around JSON, hence no need for much validation
[06:09:59] <amazigh> but JSON Schema is a standard.
[06:10:48] <s-liao> Like http://json-schema.org/
[06:10:55] <Zipheir> Yes.
[06:13:45] <s-liao> But what json file is almost like js file, what is the validation for the subset of js file?
[06:14:36] <s-liao> the validation is for the reader of js file?
[06:15:06] <amazigh> the goal is the make sure the JSON file has the correct shape
[06:15:13] <amazigh> that input validation
[06:15:16] <amazigh> that is input validation
[06:17:11] <s-liao> Do we have the same concept in the scheme?
[06:18:09] <Zipheir> S-exp validation?
[06:19:52] <amazigh> There is no formal spec yet
[06:20:05] <s-liao> https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html
[06:20:28] <Zipheir> (read) does Scheme validation.
[06:26:35] <s-liao> Yes. Read in scheme and Elisp are super security in term of the input validation.

[06:35:03] <wasamasa> OWASP is not concerned with correctness of code
[06:35:34] <wasamasa> they just provide checklists what to avoid so that you don't get pwned or yelled at by your auditor
[06:37:09] <Zipheir> What's the point of performing input validation on a program?  You're screwed anyway if you're executing something from an untrusted source.
[06:37:36] <wasamasa> yes
[06:37:50] <wasamasa> it's misleading to talk about JSON as a JS subset
[06:38:02] <wasamasa> it isn't even
[06:38:17] <wasamasa> it very much looks like it (which makes it easier to think about)

[06:41:39] <s-liao> wasamasa yes. OWASP is just a cheatsheets. I thought that you  probly have something to say about the input validation.
[06:41:53] <wasamasa> ultimately, JSON is an underspecified serialization format and JS is a turing-complete language
[06:42:16] <wasamasa> OWASP reminds you that you shouldn't do stuff like using eval to parse JSON (because then you'd treat it like JS, not JSON)
[06:42:29] <wasamasa> (yes, people did that)
[06:42:42] <wasamasa> (yes, there's intentional workarounds to break code doing that)
[06:43:09] <wasamasa> I don't really have anything to say here
[06:43:36] <Zipheir> "I have nothing to say.  And I am saying it." --John Cage
[06:43:57] <wasamasa> the entire reason that input validation avoids unexpected behavior is because it forces you to be explicit about what expected behavior should be
[06:44:53] <wasamasa> OWASP teaches you which approaches work better and what trade-offs they have, but it doesn't teach you how to engineer a correct program
[06:45:30] <Zipheir> Sounds a bit like a type system.
[06:45:39] <wasamasa> yeah
[06:46:10] <wasamasa> it's quite interesting how several classes of vulnerabilities just disappear if you introduce formal methods into your code
[06:49:02] <s-liao> which one is more close to the serialization process?
[06:50:19] <wasamasa> I need more context to answer that
[06:51:13] <s-liao> Yes. Like the electricity off, what would happen during the application is running.
[06:51:42] <wasamasa> that doesn't help me figuring out what you meant to say
[06:52:29] <wasamasa> anyway, it's late
[06:53:38] <s-liao> the electricity off suddenly during the application is running, what is living objects in the application. serialization object in the disk.
