[00:09:36] <curium> was just curious

[00:41:56] <mario-goulart> Not so much the stupidity.
[00:48:08] <Guest38-Marek> Good evening fellow schemers! My name is Marek and I'm from Wejherowo and new to chicken(and also pretty fresh in all this scheme and lisp world). Can anyone help me out with getting chicken to work on Debian11? I did manage to get everything running on my Antix localbox. In fact I installed almost all 505 eggs here :)) However, now I'd like to get
[00:48:08] <Guest38-Marek> my program to work on a linode server. So i've got debian11 here and installed the chicken debs, but cannot compile nor run my compiled boinary or script here because of a problem with srfi-14! It won't build because srfi-14.types is missing! I have a srfi-14 folder in .cache and there's some  stuff there but srfi-14.types is indeed missing! Does
[00:48:09] <Guest38-Marek> anybody has a clue what i could try in this situation?

[00:53:52] <klovett> Guest38-Marek: try retrieving srfi-14 again, the .types is in mine. at worst i can paste a copy
[00:55:36] <mario-goulart> Guest38-Marek: welcome!
[00:56:11] <mario-goulart> I wonder what caused srfi-14.types to be missing.  Did the installation of eggs fail at some point?
[01:00:44] <Guest38-Marek> Thankyou kovett for your quick help. Thank you mario! Actually I was installing http-client and srfi-14 seemed to be a dependency
[01:01:44] <Guest38-Marek> chciken-install -r srfi-14 didnt do anything, but i removed the .cahce folder and tried again to install srfi-14 and now it dit get the srfi14.types
[01:03:07] <Guest38-Marek> and it compiled srfi-14 now (and http-client :)  )
[01:05:01] <Guest38-Marek> i have no idea what caused the .types to be missing, but i think that as far as i remember a few out of the 505 eggs didnt build on my localbox(though i would have to analyze this matter)
[01:05:58] <mario-goulart> Ok.  Thanks for the details.  I'd guess the problem with srfi-14 was problem related to a fetch error.
[01:06:58] <mario-goulart> Regarding egg build failures, most likely your system doesn't have all the required libraries/headers some eggs depend on (some can be rather obscure).
[01:14:41] <Guest38-Marek> I think so too. I was only this one file and i hadn't any such problems with 14 while i was building on local. I would even say that chicken is good girl and does not make any troubles(that's why i felt hopeless with this types thing missing!)
[01:16:09] <Guest38-Marek> I just installed on this 1core, 1gb linode the brev egg, which has isn't the smallest and it was done in 2 minutes without any errors
[01:17:30] <mario-goulart> Excellent.

[10:18:57] <sjamaan> Jesus how many dependencies does one need just for some literal syntax?
[10:19:35] <sjamaan> Looks like a bug in this egg
[10:20:35] <s-liao>     r7rs
[10:20:35] <s-liao>     srfi-1
[10:20:36] <s-liao>     srfi-145
[10:20:36] <s-liao>     srfi-152
[10:20:37] <s-liao>     srfi-160
[10:21:07] <s-liao> those are the dependencies
[10:21:20] <sjamaan> yeah that's ridiculous!
[10:22:30] <s-liao> You mean that it need r7rs egg or the other eggs
[10:22:54] <s-liao> r7rs-small is like a package?
[10:22:54] <sjamaan> I guess that's the price to pay for portable code :S
[10:24:43] <sjamaan> Anyway, it looks like this egg simply doesn't implement the reader syntax part
[10:25:17] <sjamaan> heh, the manual actually says so right at the end of the opening paragraph: https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/srfi-207
[10:26:58] <s-liao> The portable code is like for abstract stuff. If there is a special need. then it will get sucked
[10:28:13] <s-liao> https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/srfi-207#formal-syntax?
[10:30:20] <sjamaan> No, the opening paragraph, right at the start says "This egg currently provides only the bytestring library; reader support for the external notation cannot be implemented as an egg, but a variant of the notation compatible with CHICKEN's reader macros may be added in a future release."
[10:32:21] <s-liao> oh
[10:34:31] <s-liao> read-textual-bytestring  works.
[10:34:53] <s-liao> Thanks
[10:41:49] <s-liao> #u8 "string" like opposite meaning to the c language.
[10:43:51] <s-liao> when add the prefix to string. it can be turned to character to wide character.

[10:57:13] <s-liao> Anyway. I mean String-notated  is an abstract, but it come down to String-notated bytevector, it is a special need.
[11:05:31] <s-liao> It is much heavily dependence  on srfi-152.
