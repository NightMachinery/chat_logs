[18:00:31] <wyre> hi guys, I'm trying to run ffmpeg asynchronously https://bpa.st/GB6Q

[18:12:22] <Byteflux> wyre: presumably it wouldn't matter whether it's sync or async, if the process fails to start or produces an error, you'd inspect the process object for an error. probably want to consult the docs on symfony process for that.
[18:14:05] <wyre> Byteflux, I can't see here anything about process objects debugging https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/process.html
[18:14:47] <Byteflux> Search the page for 'error'
[18:14:52] <Byteflux> I'm sure something will turn up
[18:15:30] <biberu> wyre: uh, when would that class be instantiated and it's methods called? you're not assuming it's state survives across requests?
[18:15:49] <Byteflux> That too, async doesn't mean it'll survive between requests
[18:16:17] <biberu> wyre: careful with starting processes from your httpd too, what if someone starts thousands of them? did you consider a queue?
[18:16:47] <wyre> biberu, lines 21 and 22
[18:17:14] <biberu> what about them?
[18:17:18] <Byteflux> Once the request has been served, if the process is still running, it's killed.
[18:18:02] <wyre> biberu, is where the class Process is instantiated
[18:18:08] <wyre> and the start() method called, right?
[18:19:02] <biberu> wyre: sure, but what happens before that? i guess this is done when someone makes an http request?
[18:19:07] <Byteflux> wyre: If this code triggered directly from a request controller?
[18:19:13] <Byteflux> Is*
[18:19:17] <wyre> biberu, Byteflux it's a button
[18:19:24] *** Quits: Xaldafax (~xaldafax@cpe-198-72-160-101.socal.res.rr.com) (Quit: Bye...)
[18:19:35] <Byteflux> Okay, I'll take that as a yes
[18:19:41] <Byteflux> Assuming it's a button on a page or something
[18:19:49] *** Joins: Xaldafax (~xaldafax@cpe-198-72-160-101.socal.res.rr.com)
[18:19:54] <wyre> sure, it's a button on a view, right
[18:20:02] <Byteflux> I think you might be misunderstanding what async means here
[18:20:30] <Byteflux> Async just means "do this thing but don't wait for it to finish, so I can do other stuff at the same time"
[18:20:44] <Byteflux> It doesn't necessarily mean "run this in the background"
[18:20:47] <wyre> well, I'd like to have a async process because at the same time a progress bar is filled
[18:20:59] <Byteflux> Once the page has been served, the process is killed.
[18:21:48] <Byteflux> Like biberu said you need to use some kind of job queue
[18:22:01] <Byteflux> Looks like you're using Laravel? https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/queues
[18:22:18] <biberu> and as far as that class is concerned php exited too, the next time you click a button to check the result it starts over from scratch
[18:22:58] <wyre> Byteflux, this is symfony
[18:23:08] <Byteflux> Ah well I'm sure there's something for that too
[18:23:27] <wyre> but I don't get your point, the page is already served when you are able to click the button that triggers the function
[18:23:47] <Byteflux> Your ffmpeg process is a child process, it's killed when PHP exits.
[18:24:27] <biberu> ^ and php exited when it was done with that page
[18:24:57] <biberu> if you want to remember things between requests you have to manage that explicitly
[18:27:06] <biberu> wyre: it's a bit hard to understand, but i'd advice you to look up php's lifecycle and the general structure of http requests and responses, it'll make it easier to understand what appears to be going on here
[18:28:10] <Byteflux> In the case of PHP, the application isn't constantly running. The application is created and destroyed on each HTTP request.
[18:33:10] <biberu> wyre: your browser probably has a network log to show you the requests it sends, usually accessed via F12, perhaps that can help to visualize it
[18:39:01] <wyre> so then is not triggered this script when I click the button?

[18:40:10] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[18:42:47] <Byteflux> wyre: You have to understand how HTTP and PHP work. Button click -> HTTP request -> PHP/Symfony -> HTTP response -> Result in browser. By the time your browser has loaded the new page, PHP is finished. Your process is no longer running, it's forcefully terminated.
[18:43:01] <Byteflux> That means ffmpeg is no longer running

[18:43:25] <biberu> wyre: my *guess* is that you're issuing a request from a button in a form, and that is intended to start a new ffpmg process. the user does not wait for it to finish, but sees another page, and this is what you mean by "async". is that correct?
[18:43:41] *** Joins: phlixi (~phlixi@ppp-46-244-173-22.dynamic.mnet-online.de)
[18:44:29] <wyre> Byteflux, in this case, the browser doesn't have to load a new page, because when you click the button a progress bar starts to fill while the process is alive
[18:44:47] <Byteflux> What is keeping the request alive?
[18:44:53] <Byteflux> The PHP process
[18:45:00] *** Quits: mIk3_08 (~Thunderbi@user/mik3-08/x-2852566) (Quit: mIk3_08)
[18:45:15] <Byteflux> wyre: What are you doing to stop PHP from terminating?
[18:45:29] <biberu> and how are the progress updates sent?
[18:45:47] <wyre> in fact there are two buttons, one to execute the process and another to reset the process when you want (which is the resetDiagnisis() function)
[18:46:14] <wyre> Byteflux, it stops by itself when the audio finishes (20s)
[18:46:36] <Byteflux> When the 'Process' finishes?
[18:46:38] <wyre> that's why the time to fill the progress bar is set manually at 20s
[18:47:01] <Byteflux> But you started the process asynchronously. Why would it wait for it to finish?
[18:47:10] <Byteflux> Async means "don't wait for me to finish"
[18:47:41] <wyre> because both processes are 20s long
[18:47:54] <Byteflux> But you started the process async, did you not?
[18:48:00] <wyre> yes
[18:48:13] <Byteflux> So then PHP is going to terminate when it's done with the request, it's not going to wait for the process to finish.
[18:48:20] <Byteflux> That's what async is?
[18:48:30] <Byteflux> And when PHP terminates, the process is also terminated.
[18:49:12] <biberu> wyre: so if you click one button you start ffmpeg and save the process id, and when you click another you want that same id to be remembered? do you understand why that state might be lost at that point?

[22:17:18] <__adrian> composer is not a packagist client

[22:19:44] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi how are you sir?
[22:20:54] <sweb> how to publish package problem is it's mono repo contain folder for PHP package ... not root folder on github
[22:21:39] <sweb> __adrian: https://github.com/aasaam/aes/tree/master/php
[22:21:40] <__adrian> you mean it's not it's own repo?
[22:21:57] <__adrian> it should be its own repo
[22:22:32] <__adrian> git does have submodules, if you need to keep it in the "parent" repo as well
[22:22:40] <sweb> __adrian: problem is packagist not accept sub-directory of repo during submit
[22:22:55] <__adrian> right,  "@__adrian> it should be its own repo"
[22:23:16] <__adrian> this is bad organization in general (not specifically a packagist problem)
[22:24:10] <sweb> golang supported easily, npm is client dosnt matter where is the folder you can publish but packagist/composer dosnt
[22:24:26] <__adrian> the "folder" itself doesn't matter
[22:24:33] <__adrian> it needs to be its own _repo_
[22:24:56] <__adrian> whether you do that with submodules or whatever hackery
[22:26:03] <__adrian> (1) move the code inito its own repo, so it can be its own project.  (2) IF you still need the project in the original place, put it there through some other means (a submodule, an install script, etc.). though it would be better to make the new project a dependency, if possible.
[22:26:50] <sweb> __adrian: that's lot work to do, ok i will try. thanks for help bwt
