[02:59:12] <POGtastic> hi, got an abstract algebra question. "Show that if φ : R to S is a ring homomorphism, then φ is injective iff its kernel is trivial." I can easily show injectivity implying that the kernel is trivial, but I'm not sure how to work backwards.
[02:59:28] <POGtastic> With the group homomorphism, I can take inverses, but I don't think I can do that with the ring homomorphism...
[03:03:22] <Z-module> For the converse, take its contrapositive. Assume the map is not injective. Now deal with two distinct elements is sends to the same image.
[03:04:45] *** Joins: Trashlord (~trash@user/trashlord)
[03:06:01] <Z-module> It turns out you only need the fact that the map is a homomorphism of groups (the additive groups of the two rings). So inverses won't even come up.
[03:06:11] <SGautam> Why are 3 sets of vectors linearly independent when the determinant is non-zero? Shouldn't it be the reverse?
[03:06:37] *** Quits: Pickchea (~private@user/pickchea) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:07:03] <SGautam> Linear independence means the equation a*v1 + b*v2 + c*v3 = 0 has no non-trivial solution
[03:07:14] <SGautam> (for a, b, c)
[03:07:49] <SGautam> So if you take the determinant of [x1 y1 z1], [x2, y2, z2], [x3, y3, z3] it should be zero for no solution right?
[03:07:56] <SGautam> But its the other way around.
[03:08:02] <SGautam> (as in for linear independence)
[03:12:23] <POGtastic> Z-module: So I'm looking at a \neq b, but φ(a) = φ(b). If this were just a group, I'd be going "φ(ab^-1) φ(a)φ(b^-1) = φ(a)φ(b)^-1 = φ(a)φ(a)^-1 = 0," which implies that ab^{-1} = 0, which implies that a = b. Since this is a ring, can I just note that this is also an additive group?

[03:30:21] <Z-module> POGtastic:  we're only using the additve groups of these rings for this, so it ends up as  f(a - b) = f(a) - f(b)
[03:30:53] <Z-module> in other words, your "b^-1" in the additive group of R is  -b   and then a '*' that is  a + (-b)   which is what a - b means
[03:31:47] <Z-module> Since 0_S is the additive identity element in S, the kernel of f, for just this group situation, is all the x in R with   f(x) = 0_S
[03:31:55] <POGtastic> Z-module: gotcha. so it's really φ(a - b) = φ(a) - φ(b) = φ(a) - φ(a) = φ(0). Then a - b = 0, so a = b
[03:31:58] <Z-module> and your goal is show that some x != 0_R  is in that
[03:32:36] <POGtastic> sorry, φ(a) - φ(a) = 0_S (which is φ(0_R))
[03:32:52] <Z-module> actually   f(a) - f(a)  is just 0_S  outright
[03:32:57] <POGtastic> ^
[03:33:04] <Z-module> it's an element of S added to its own inverse
[03:33:43] <Z-module> f(0_R) is *always* going to be 0_S  for any homomorphism at all. Forget that. You're only dealing with f(something nonzero) here

[03:44:34] <Z-module> POGtastic: I would separate the directions:   (I) Say f is injective. Since f is a homom., we already know f(0_R) = 0_S, so if any r != 0_R existed with f(r) = 0 too, that violates the injectivity of f. So ker(f) = {0_R}.    (II) Say ker(f) = {0_R}. If some r != r' existed with f(r) = f(r'), we get  0 = f(r) - f(r') = f(r - r'), but this means the nonzero element r - r' would be in ker(f).

[08:51:10] <_0xMsFoxyEmilySm> instead of asking 'whats the shortest path between 2 nodes in a graph aka Dijkstras alg' you'd just encode it as 'compute 1 in base b'

[11:47:29] <tom__> mycroftiv: How is the topology in Lean going?
[11:48:42] <tom__> Does every uni math course expect you to just "use" the results of proofs from lectures/notes in weekly problem sheets?
[11:49:22] <mycroftiv> tom__: I work in Agda, and it has gone well, im pausing the technical part of formalizing set theory/large cardinals/ultrafilters until i work out some connected things
[11:49:33] <PlanckWalk> tom__: Not just results
[11:49:53] <PlanckWalk> THey expect you to know the proofs themselves at least well enough to adapt them to similar premises.
[11:50:08] <tom__> mycroftiv: Oh are you contributing to mathlib?
[11:51:11] <tom__> PlancWalk: So they expect you to use them without justification in problem sheets but they expect you to fully understand their justification?
[11:51:54] <tom__> It seems like lots of different proofs have key ideas that are shared
[11:52:48] <tom__> Like  contradiction where you construct an element slightly bigger
[11:53:35] <tom__> I think maybe that is what makes proofs tricky to learn at first because there is this hidden layer of patterns that come from experience
[11:54:25] <PlanckWalk> tom__: I mean that some problem sheets will include questions where you need to adapt a proof you've seen in order to solve theproblem.
[11:54:41] <PlanckWalk> (Not just the result)
[11:54:50] <tom__> Yeah
[11:55:04] <PlanckWalk> And yes, there are a lot of common themes across proofs
[11:55:26] <tom__> Is it possible to formalise these common themes?
[11:55:33] <tom__> Is that what category theory does?
[11:55:39] <PlanckWalk> That's one of the reasons behind generalized abstract nonsense.
[11:55:43] <PlanckWalk> Err, category theory.
[11:56:17] <PlanckWalk> A lot of these things in there are generalizations of patterns across a bunch of other fields
[11:56:19] <tom__> My word I never realised just how darn abstract category theory is
[11:57:08] <tom__> Does it get the name abstract nonsense because its an abstraction of an abstraction and a lot of people dont see the point?
[11:57:22] <PlanckWalk> I mean really, pretty much everything in math boils down to "generalizes some pattern and makes proofs easier"
[11:57:28] <tom__> Yeah
[11:57:51] <tom__> What is the mathematical object of study in CT
[12:00:46] <tom__> perhaps relationships between mathematical objects
[12:01:10] <xelxebar> tom__: Anwser probably depends on who you ask; CT is a large, broad subject, but the fable is that MacLane invented categories and functors as tools to define the notion of a natural transformation.
[12:02:40] <xelxebar> Motivationally, elementary CT can be seen as way of making precise a bunch of analogies that happen between fields.

[12:06:54] <xelxebar> tom__: Hrm. For me personally, CT is immensely helpful as an organizational framework. It extracts out and names broad connections and features that would otherwise require ad-hoc characterizations and be harder to cognate about.
[12:07:27] <xelxebar> It's firmly rooted in algebra.

[13:35:51] <tom__> So you don't need a base case because you aren't just assuming the last single step is true but all preceding steps for any arbitrary step?
[13:35:55] <xelxebar> Yeah, basically. The induction step is a computation. Think of it like a function, say F, that maps f(n) values to f(n+1) values. You can then compare f(n+1) against F(f(n)).
[13:36:15] <ski> you recover the base case if you set ⌜n⌝ to ⌜0⌝, since then ⌜∀ m ∈ ℕ | m < 0. P(m)⌝ is vacuously true, seeing as ⌜0⌝ is the least natural
[13:37:12] <tom__> Thanks this might be exactly what I was looking for!
[13:37:19] <ski> i was thinking that, maybe, if you're seeing you're duplicating formulae or arguments in the base case (compared to the induction step), then *maybe* you could "absorb" that into the induction step, by course-of-values

[14:19:24] <ski> when you compare your induction goal to your induction hypothesis, the differences are typically something like ⌜n⌝s in the IH being replaced by ⌜n + 1⌝'s in the IG, and we, somehow, want to bridge the chasm. so, working backwards from the IG, towards the IH, we use rewrite rules (backward implications, often equalities or inequalities), to "ripple" the "diff" ⌜⋯ + 1⌝ outwards (perhaps ⌜f(n +
[14:19:30] <ski> 1)⌝ becomes ⌜f(n) ⋅ n⌝, e.g., in which case the new "diff" is ⌜⋯ ⋅ n⌝). their terminology is that it's like a wavefront that keeps moving
[14:20:16] <ski> eventually, the massaged IG becomes a formula which has all its diffs on the outside, and a copy of the IH on the inside, at which point it follows immediately from the IH

[14:24:30] <ski> e.g. if you're proving ⌜∀ n ∈ ℕ. ∀ x ∈ X. R(n,x)⌝ by induction, you might be able to massage the IG ⌜∀ x ∈ X. R(n + 1,x)⌝ into ⌜∀ x ∈ X. R(n,f(x))⌝, at which point this follows from the IH ⌜∀ x ∈ X. R(n,x)⌝, by setting the ⌜x⌝ there to the ⌜f(x)⌝ in the massaged IG

[16:09:13] <Josep> thanks ski
[16:09:16] <ski> np
[16:09:25] <zacts> I have a few books on the subject, but I feel stuck.
[16:10:38] <zacts> like, for example, I'm looking at ch 1.2 of Apostol's Analytic Number Theory
[16:10:41] <riv> zacts: learn about modular arithmetic and prime numbers and quadratic reciprocity
[16:10:44] <zacts> which is Divisibility
[16:10:56] <zacts> what is quadratic reciprocity?
[16:11:47] <zacts> also, would you mind linking some tutorials/resources on those subjects?
[16:12:05] <riv> ireland and rosen is a good book
[16:12:21] <zacts> I especially seem to do well when I can tinker with stuff.
[16:12:36] <riv> you can do modular arithmetic experiments with e.g. sage in jupyter notebook
[16:12:52] <zacts> oh cool
[16:13:02] <riv> rosen covers what i said, as well as eulers totient and The Structure of U(ℤ/nℤ)
[16:13:06] <riv> which are also really good
[16:13:22] <zacts> oh cool thanks
[16:13:38] <Josep> zacts I have exactly what you need

[16:34:49] <haasn> Say I have a coin that may or may not be weighted, and my prior belief is that the coin is fair, i.e. P(H) = 0.5. I flip the coin and it lands on heads. My understanding of Bayesian inference is that I should now slightly update my estimate of P(H) to reflect this new evidence. (If I keep flipping the coin and keep getting heads, I would eventually converge on P(H) = 1). But I'm struggling to see
[16:34:49] <greenbagels> rsonx | There are uncountably infinite subsets of a countably infinite set.
[16:34:50] <haasn> how to fit this situation into bayes' update rule. Examples I find on the internet use a hypothesis like "coin is fair", but I'm not interested in *whether* or not the coin is fair, I'm interested in updating my assessment of P(H). Maybe what I am doing is not possible with just a number alone, and I would need to use some kind of probability distribution over possible values of P(H)? (But then,
[16:34:52] <haasn> what distribution would I assume? Uniform probability?)
[16:35:01] <greenbagels> rsonx: do you mean uncountably many?

[16:40:16] <haasn> riv: I see what you mean, but my point is that I'm interested in finding the mean of the resulting probability distribution for P(H), not the value at 0.5
[16:40:33] <haasn> (the latter is what I would interpret as "probability that the coin is fair")
[16:40:44] <riv> so we start of by not knowing anything about the coin
[16:40:50] <riv> but we assume it is memoryless
[16:41:00] <riv> so each flip is independent
[16:41:17] <riv> so we model the coin as having P(Heads) = c, P(Tails) = 1-c, for some c
[16:41:34] <riv> we don't necessarily assume c = 1/2 to start with
[16:41:50] <riv> we assume a uniform probability distribution that c is any number from 0 to 1
[16:42:20] <rsonx> greenbagels: yes. I meant that there are uncountably infinite number of subsets of a countably infinite set.
[16:42:31] <riv> from perform experiments this distribution becomes gaussian (I think) with its maximum around where you would expect
[16:42:54] <riv> i.e. if you got heads 10 times and tails 30 times, it would peak near 10 / 40
[16:43:27] <riv> but P(Heads) is not necessarily 10 / 40
[16:43:37] <haasn> riv: and if I have a prior guess on the coin fairness, I could start with an appropriate normal distribution?
[16:43:58] *** Quits: ppw (~ppw@user/ppw) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[16:44:00] <riv> I think there's a reason why it's bad to do that
[16:44:08] <haasn> e.g. say I have tested a similar coin from the same manufacturer in the past and came up with a normal distribution for that
[16:44:20] <haasn> or, indeed, say I have tested this same coin a year ago and I am simply continuing my trials from there
[16:45:07] <haasn> it just seems to me that approximating the distribution in a 'void' like this, without incorporating any prior information, sort of defeats the point of bayesian statistics (i.e. incorporating prior knowledge into experimental outcomes)
[16:45:36] <riv> I think "prior information" is a misnomer
[16:45:42] <riv> priors and information are separate things
[16:46:17] <riv> the model you create is a prior, information is used to affect the parameters of the model to prove better prediction

[19:16:04] <Z-module> tom__:  oh wait, sorry.   a in A  means   a in X_n  for all n. Now f(a) is in X = X_0, and since a is in X_n for all n = 0,1,2,...  then  f(a) in f(X_n) = X_{n+1} for all n = 0,1,2,..., meaning in X_n for all n = 1,2,3,...   and f(a) is still in X_0 too, so f(a) is in all X_n for n = 0,1,2,..., so it is in A.

For the case b = 10 and n = 7, it is actually just the sequence 1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, ... so a divisibility test for 7 based on digits is that the dot product of the digit sequence and this (1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, ...) sequence mod 7 is 0...

[23:01:49] <Josep> also why not including the suqare root inside the sum
[23:04:20] <Franciman> have you ever heard about correct statistics?
[23:04:29] <Franciman> i don't know the english name, tbf
[23:04:36] <Josep> uh no
[23:04:42] <Franciman> basically it is a mathematical thing
[23:04:47] <Franciman> to get correct estimators of the variance
[23:05:02] <Josep> so not 100% correct answer?
[23:05:05] <Franciman> i.e. the expected value of standard deviation
[23:05:10] <Franciman> is the variance of the population
[23:05:15] <Franciman> if you don't divide by n-1
[23:05:22] <Franciman> you don't get this result
[23:05:26] <Franciman> but i can't explain the intuition behind it
[23:05:30] <Franciman> so
[23:05:33] <Franciman> to rephrase more clearly
[23:05:41] <Franciman> that definition of \sigma = sqrt(things)
[23:05:45] <Franciman> wait wait
[23:05:50] <Gurkenglas> Josep, sqrt directly after ^ is just absolute value, though
[23:05:56] <Gurkenglas> *after ^2
[23:06:20] <Franciman> let's try with \sigma^2 = 1 / (n-1) * sum from 1 to n of (x_i - xavg)^2
[23:06:27] <Franciman> this statistics has the property that
[23:06:38] <Franciman> the expected value of \sigma^2 is the variance of your population
[23:06:44] <Franciman> while if you divide by n, this isn't true
[23:07:23] <Franciman> now, Josep this is a math thing, i've seen many practicioners divide by n
[23:07:24] <Josep> but what I am saying is that the correct formula should be this
[23:07:26] <Franciman> when n is sufficiently large
[23:07:34] <Josep> deviance = Sum from 1 to n of ( sqrt((xi-xavg)^2))/n
[23:07:41] <Josep> why is this formula incorrect?
[23:08:02] <Franciman> first of all the sqrt goes outside because deviance is the sqrt of statistical variance
[23:08:16] <Franciman> which is sum (x_i - xavg)^2 / (n-1)
[23:08:18] <Josep> sqrt should be inside the sum not outside because if we put it outside it would give different answers
[23:08:34] <Josep> I dont agree
[23:08:35] <Franciman> no we put it outside, because if we put it inside, it wouldn't be what we want
[23:08:37] <Franciman> :D
[23:08:43] <Franciman> what is your intuition for std dev?
[23:08:49] <Josep> but if we put it outside it wouldnt be want we want lol
[23:08:59] <confuzeus> Josep: there is a difference between population standard deviation and sample standard deviation. the population standard deviation divides by n. the sample standard deviation by n-1. there is bias introduced by doing things on samples so the sample standard deviation has a correction for the bias
[23:09:24] <Josep> we want an average for the distance between a number in our sample and the average of our sample so this formula models it correctly Sum from 1 to n of ( sqrt((xi-xavg)^2))/n or I am not understanding what we want
[23:09:59] <confuzeus> the correction is called bessel's correction (see here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction )

[23:12:27] <confuzeus> Josep: also there is nothing preventing you from empirically calculating the standard deviation by your approach as well the other other approaches and see if you get similar results. that may help you get some intuition and even strengthen your argument
[23:13:12] <Josep> I am getting close esults but not similar
[23:13:39] <Gurkenglas> Josep, your formula models what you describe correctly, and the sqrt-of-average-of-squared-distance formula models something else. both formulas do something, and calling them correct or incorrect looks so far just like a disagreement about definitions :)
[23:13:56] <Josep> for example if I have this sample 1,4,6,7 of average 4.5 I got 2.6 for deviance while using the normal formula but when using my formula I got 2
[23:14:25] <Josep> but I don't understand what the other formula is supposed to do?
[23:14:31] <Josep> what is it calculating exactly
[23:16:25] <confuzeus> is variance formula ok with you?
[23:16:42] <Josep> yeah but I dont understand what is it modeling
[23:16:46] <Josep> what is it calculating
[23:16:51] <Gurkenglas> Josep, good question. Let me try to give a reason for the sum-of-squares formula.
[23:17:36] <Gurkenglas> Josep, your formula can be calculated for not just the mean, but also for other points. Suppose one point is at 1 million and 9 points are at 0. then the average is 100000.
[23:17:38] <Josep> my formula for instance calculates the average of the distances between each number of the sample and the average of the sample
[23:17:53] <Gurkenglas> And your formula gives 180000, I think.
[23:18:19] <Gurkenglas> If we calculate your formula not with respect to the average, but with respect to 0, then we get an average distance of 100000.
[23:19:08] <Gurkenglas> If we calculate your formula with respect to all possible reference points, we'll get the minimum average distance at the "median": the point where there's as many points above as below
[23:19:17] <Josep> the average should be 1000000x9 / 10
[23:19:18] <Gurkenglas> the sum-of-squares formula is minimal at the average.
[23:19:35] <Josep> from 0 to 1 million
[23:19:36] <Gurkenglas> makes sense?
[23:20:07] <Josep> one second
[23:21:01] <Gurkenglas> Of course you can say, just like we should care about your formula instead of sum-of-squares, we should care about median instead of average.
[23:21:31] *** Joins: jellydonut (~quassel@cBC66BF51.dhcp.as2116.net)
[23:21:34] <Josep> if we have 9 points at 0 and 1 point at 1 million the average is 1000000 so the average distance between each point and 1 million is 9x1000000/10 = 900000
[23:21:35] <Gurkenglas> That's not unreasonable. The median makes more sense than the average for, for example, grades, which are more about ranking than numbers.
[23:21:57] <Josep> ops
[23:22:03] <Josep> I made a mistake the average is not 1000000
[23:22:12] <Gurkenglas> Try again with 9 points at 0 and one point at 100 :D
[23:22:13] <Josep> the average is 1000000/10 lol

[23:23:42] <Josep> so 10 points in total the average is 100/10 = 10 and the average distance between each point and the average 10 is  9x10/10 = 9
[23:24:08] <Gurkenglas> (9x10+1x90)/10, there's also the point at 100 :)
[23:24:48] <Josep> ops I forgot the 90 yeah
[23:24:57] <Josep> lmao this is so confusing

[23:30:09] <Gurkenglas> When we calculate the average distance of these 10 points to a point between them, moving the point left will decrease 9 distances and increase 1 distance, so we can minimize it by moving it all the way to the 9 points.
[23:30:10] <Josep> correct
[23:31:19] <Gurkenglas> you could imagine that each of the 10 points pulls the reference point towards them, so it'll move until there's equal pull in both directions.
[23:31:31] <Josep> however the formula doesn't understand that we have 9 points left and 1 right it just understands the average
[23:31:42] <Josep> it depends only of the average
[23:32:12] <Gurkenglas> Well, then. *Why* do you think your formula is good?

[23:44:46] <confuzeus> you didnt get the explanation i gave earlier?
[23:45:02] <Josep> wait
[23:45:06] <Josep> I think I understood 1 part
[23:45:31] <Josep> I think this is the only reason
[23:45:33] <Josep> With samples, we use n – 1 in the formula because using n would give us a biased estimate that consistently underestimates variability. The sample variance would tend to be lower than the real variance of the population.
[23:45:33] <Josep> Reducing the sample n to n – 1 makes the variance artificially large, giving you an unbiased estimate of variability: it is better to overestimate rather than underestimate variability in samples.
[23:46:21] <Josep> so we do it on purpose just to make it bigger?
[23:46:34] <Josep> is that correct?
[23:46:46] <PJBoy> suppose you take a sample of size n, so you have these n sample data values
[23:46:48] <Gurkenglas> uhhhh. i would expect the correction to do an estiamte that is on average correct, not an overestimate o.o
[23:47:07] <PJBoy> and you derive from that the sample mean from those n sample values
[23:47:30] <PJBoy> well given n-1 of those sample values and the sample mean, you can determine what the remaining 1 sample value is
[23:47:57] <PJBoy> for population mean, that relationship doesn't hold
[23:48:22] <PJBoy> your n-1 sample values and population mean don't help you determine the 1 remaining sample value, because the population mean isn't derived from the n sample values

[23:50:59] <Josep> that's what I just read
[23:51:09] <PJBoy> you only have n-1 sources of real information, so it only makes sense to divide by n-1 in your calculation
[23:51:19] *** Joins: vindex10 (~vindex10@gateway/tor-sasl/vindex10)
[23:51:20] <PJBoy> I wouldn't think it in terms of "correction"
[23:51:27] <PJBoy> or over/under estimation
[23:51:54] <confuzeus> that is called bias
[23:52:03] <Gurkenglas> if you pick 2 numbers at random from those million, their average will be wrong in the same direction they're wrong. Instead of calculating distances, squared or not, to the true mean, you'll calculate smaller distances.
[23:52:07] <PJBoy> unless you use the population variance formula, in which case you need correcting
[23:52:10] <Josep> I understood what you said but this isnt a reason to divide by n-1 instead of n while you are calculating an average distance

[23:53:05] <Josep> Gurkenglas is sqrt(a^2+b^2) < sqrt(a^2)+sqrt(b^2) ?
[23:53:23] <Gurkenglas> yep.
[23:53:24] <Josep> yeah we are making the average bigger
[23:53:35] <Gurkenglas> wut
[23:53:40] <Josep> they are using this instead of distances just to make the average bigger lol
[23:53:41] <confuzeus> it is multiplying by n/n-1 rather than dividing by n-1
[23:53:46] <Josep> to not overestimate things *
[23:54:00] <Gurkenglas> Josep, no no no! using their formula instead of yours has nothing to do with the n-1 thing
[23:54:20] *** Joins: plankster (~plankster@user/plankers)
[23:54:22] <Gurkenglas> I'm not clear on whether the n-1 is the correct amount of correction, let's do the math right now.

[23:55:03] <Josep> its not a correction they are just making the formula wrong on purpose to get a bigger value so that they dont overestimate things
[23:55:08] <Josep> this is my conclusion

[23:56:44] <Josep> I am confused honestly
[23:57:32] <Josep> but using distances will make the average distance between each number and the mean of the sample bigger
[23:57:37] <Josep> so why arent they using it
[23:57:59] <Josep> since sqrt(a^2) +sqrt(b^2) > sqrt(a^2+b^2)
[23:57:59] <Gurkenglas> Josep, here I drew the underestimate thing. http://sketchtoy.com/70417305
[23:58:58] <Josep> yeah
[23:59:10] <Josep> but what is the false average / underestimated distances
[23:59:27] <Josep> their forumla?
[23:59:36] <Josep> their formula is the underestimated distances?
[23:59:42] <Josep> and mine is the true distances?
[23:59:50] <Guest1778> https://i.imgur.com/F7aWh2f.png Can anyone comment on my second proof?
[23:59:51] <Gurkenglas> what the bessel correction says is, when you don't know the average of the distribution, and so you just make it up from your samples, you'll get distances to the "average" that are too small.
