[09:38:13] <re101-goat-54> I need to do that to multiple files - find and replace only the 1st <br> tag in multiple files. What you linked to replaces every <br> in every file: https://regex101.com/r/ur89RD/1
[09:38:43] <Me-me> Sounds like a notepad++ problem. You should ask in the chatroom for notepad++. We mostly help with regex, here.

[09:39:38] <yitz> I could start kicking for off-topic questions? Also, why are people using regex to match fixed strings?
[09:39:58] <re101-goat-54> I need to do that to multiple files - find and replace only the 1st <br> tag in multiple files. What I linked to replaces every <br> in every file. A RegEx will help replace it
[09:40:27] <yitz> re101-goat-54: regex101.com doesn't support multiple files
[09:40:39] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/ur89RD/5 This will match the first instance only - the reason is because of the lack of "global" modifier. How notepad++ would represent that, I don't know. It may not even be a feature of their search function.
[09:40:58] <re101-goat-54> OK, so can you give me a RegEx to find the 1st <br> tag?
[09:41:14] <yitz> <br>
[09:41:24] <yitz> 21:59 +     yitz| https://regex101.com/r/ur89RD/4  finds the first <br>
[09:41:50] <yitz> Though you don't need a regex to find-and-replace a fixed string...
[09:41:51] <Me-me> As yitz said. The pattern is valid and accurate. We can't really help with the implementation.
[09:43:01] <re101-goat-54> +Me-me the `\s*<br>\s*-` replaces every <br> tag which I don't want
[09:43:16] * yitz facepalms
[09:43:19] <Me-me> That's not the pattern's fault.
[09:43:33] <Me-me> And as a result, we can't help you.
[09:43:36] <re101-goat-54> I need to do that to multiple files - find and replace only the 1st <br> tag in multiple files. What I linked to replaces every <br> in every file. A RegEx will help replace it
[09:43:37] <yitz> Click "replace" and not "replace-all"
[09:43:50] <yitz> A regex really doesn't help
[09:44:00] <re101-goat-54> it does
[09:44:07] <yitz> Can I kick, Me-me?

[20:01:56] <purplex> a simple dos game :p
[20:01:57] <re101-collie-25> Hi guys, u have a simple regex :  \\b\\d{1,7}\\b, problem is that this regex catch this 123-345-456
[20:02:56] <re101-collie-25> How can tell the regex to not end with "-"  ?
[20:03:01] <OnlineCop> re101-collie-25: The `\b` boundaries don't check that there are whitespace characters to the left/right, so it matches '123' and '345' and '456'.
[20:03:26] <OnlineCop> To not end with "-", you can use a negative look-ahead: `\b\d{1,7}\b(?!-)`
[20:03:57] <OnlineCop> That would match '456' even though there's a hyphen before the digit.
[20:04:45] <OnlineCop> If you're using a regex language that supports look-behinds: `(?<!-)` right before the first `\b` could eliminate that problem.
[20:05:39] <OnlineCop> If you're using a regex language that DOESN'T support them, you can match the character before (change from non-capturing to capturing if you need to "keep" that character in some kind of substitution): `(?:^|\s)\d{1,7}\b(?!-)`
[20:06:10] <OnlineCop> re101-collie-25: Which regex language/flavor are you using?
[20:08:46] <digitok> english/orange
[20:11:42] <re101-collie-25> Awesome! can u explain to me the concept of look behind  look ahead ? or just send me link ? 
[20:12:27] <OnlineCop> re101-collie-25: The "full" explanation on https://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html is great, but it might be overwhelming.
[20:12:46] <re101-collie-25> Thanks!
[20:13:42] <OnlineCop> You have two look-around types: "peek" to the left or "peek" to the right. You will assert that you do/don't find text to the left with either `(?<= ... )` or `(?<! ... )`, or assert that you do/don't find text to the right with either `(?= ... )` or `(?! ... )`.
[20:15:17] <OnlineCop> The  `(?<!-)`  from earlier said that, at this position right before the `\b\d{1,7}\b`, to peek at the previous character. If it is NOT a `-` character, then continue with the rest of the `\b\d{1,7}\b` pattern. However, if it finds a `-` character, the match fails right then, and it tries again at the next position in the string.

[21:16:48] <re101-ocelot-82> guys how can I match the whole <order> tag in two separate regexp? one for the first and one for the second (not both in one regexp). can anyone help?
[21:17:30] <re101-ocelot-82> i have this so far <order>[\s\S]*?<\/order> but it matches both in one query
[21:29:12] <simcop2387> digitok: OnlineCop: definitely doable
[21:30:02] <OnlineCop> simcop2387: It wasn't a feature request, by the way. Just an observation. :D
[21:31:02] <OnlineCop> re101-ocelot-82: The `/g` (global) flag keeps matching till the end of the document. It shows two matches, so after the first <order>...</order> was found, it would have stopped if the `/g` flag were not there.
[21:31:35] <re101-ocelot-82> yes but how can I now select (in a separate regex) the second <order> ?
[21:31:41] <re101-ocelot-82> how do I do that
[21:31:54] <re101-ocelot-82> is there something like "skip first match"? :D
[21:32:09] <OnlineCop> Are there any identifiers before one that aren't before the other?
[21:32:21] <OnlineCop> Or, does one contain something that the other doesn't?
[21:32:35] <re101-ocelot-82> yea one contains the "AAA", the other the "BBB"
[21:32:38] <re101-ocelot-82> otherwise they're mostly identical
[21:33:11] <OnlineCop> Which regex flavor/engine?
[21:33:34] <OnlineCop> For example, </wawa> is found before the 2nd <order>
[21:34:10] <re101-ocelot-82> right but actually ignore that :D  i don't know why I put it there. the <order> tags appear right next to each other
[21:34:35] <re101-ocelot-82> it's some kind of software wrapped around a c++ regexp thing I guess. so it has no support for capture groups 
[21:34:36] <OnlineCop> Do you want to find the 2nd..nth instance of <order>...</order>? Or exactly the 2nd?
[21:34:40] <re101-ocelot-82> this is why i need 2 queries
[21:34:51] <re101-ocelot-82> I think the 2nd is fine
[21:35:08] <OnlineCop> boost::regex ?
[21:35:15] <re101-ocelot-82> yea i think internally that'd be boost
[21:36:38] <OnlineCop> If you're using your https://regex101.com/r/cUXtkK/1 in code, does https://regex101.com/r/cUXtkK/2 also work? I'm trying to determine whether it supports some advanced features (like `\K`).
[21:38:17] <re101-ocelot-82> I think it will support most regex features but I am unable to code something like "give me the second result of capture group", this is why it needs to be done in two separate queries
[21:38:26] <re101-ocelot-82> also I unfortunately cannot test right now. lol
[21:39:12] <OnlineCop> Are you able to std::find() the position of the first `<order>`? If so, you could pass that offset+1 to the regex.match() that you're using.
[21:40:35] <OnlineCop> Or, are you able to share (non-proprietary, non-IP) a sample of the code that's doing the actual matching?

[21:43:36] <re101-ocelot-82> Unfortunately there is no code. It's more of a GUI thing were you connect the input string to a so called operator (in this case the operator is called find, and supports a regex input) and you connect the output to another thing. In this case the input string is a concatenation like the one I posted of two <something> tags and I need to connect it
[21:43:37] <re101-ocelot-82> to two separate find-operators. One should spit out the first <something> and the other the last <something>. 
[21:43:54] <re101-ocelot-82> So a RegExp101 solution would be enough. I guess I could figure out the rest. I'm terrible at regex tho ^^
[21:44:12] <OnlineCop> Will the first <order> always start at character 0?

[21:46:46] <re101-ocelot-82> that should do the trick actually
[21:46:47] <OnlineCop> Although, if it doesn't understand `\K`, it's going to return the result like this: https://regex101.com/r/cUXtkK/5
[21:46:59] <OnlineCop> That's why I asked earlier whether you knew if it supported those features.
[21:47:02] <re101-ocelot-82> ok. \K is like advanced feature?
[21:47:06] <re101-ocelot-82> library may be old(er)
[21:47:17] <OnlineCop> And that can be EXPONENTIALLY slow if there's a lot of text between </order> and the next <order>
[21:47:57] <re101-ocelot-82> ok I will try that tomorrow and if it doesn't work i will find some other way :D  thank you so very much!
[21:48:05] <OnlineCop> https://www.regular-expressions.info/keep.html states that Boost 1.42 should support \K
[21:48:15] <OnlineCop> My pleasure.
[21:48:29] <re101-ocelot-82> ok now I will look in the cpp ... *opens laptop*
[21:50:07] <OnlineCop> If it uses boost, there should be results for each of the matches it found. Better yet, if you wrap the stuff you want to keep within (capture group) parens, those almost always show up in an indexed group you can use.
