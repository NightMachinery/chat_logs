[01:27:59] <energizer> am i right in thinking "functor" means something different in haskell than in math? fmap seems like a functor, not the "Functor" `f` that implements `fmap`. what is the reason for this naming convention?
[01:28:35] <monochrom> Yes and no.
[01:28:48] <nosewings> The term "Functor" in Haskell comes from math, but it basically just means "anything that has a map function"
[01:29:33] <energizer> yeah seems confusing
[01:29:54] <dsal> Functor means "that datastructure functs"
[01:30:04] <nosewings> I honestly have no idea where the use of "functor" to mean "first-class function" comes from
[01:30:25] <janus> dsal: functs is german for 'works' right?
[01:30:27] <monochrom> The standard library type class Functor is better known in math as endofunctor. Moreover, the notation is a bit different: Whereas the object map is still called Maybe or [] for example, the morphism map is called "fmap" regardless of whether it's Maybe or [] or other examples.
[01:31:28] <monochrom> Moreover you can further argue that the Functor type class is only for endofunctors on one single hardcoded category: the objects are Haskell types, the morphisms are Haskell functions.
[01:32:17] <monochrom> OTOH you can counter-argue that since that's an example of functor, the name is not wrong either.

[02:20:54] <janus> well the ST-like context could keep track of whether operations that could potentially leak the nonce are executed more than once

[02:43:38] <Axman6> why would forkIO be unsafe in a linear context? You can still track whether something linear is used ones in the forked action or the forking action, and as long as it's not used in both you're ok. Rust does exacrtly this right?
[02:44:27] <monochrom> Rust allows multiple readers. %1 doesn't.
[02:44:59] <geekosaur> and I doubt linear haskell actually knows that forkIO or forkOS or forkProcess is "special"
[02:45:04] <Axman6> so the check is even simpler for Haskell right?
[02:45:04] <monochrom> Rust's system also aims at tracking "can I free() now?", which is quite a bit different.
[02:45:50] <geekosaur> or any other of the variants that essentially dupliucate an execution context
[02:47:32] <geekosaur> we already have the problem that nothing in ghc/rts knows that in the child of a forkProcess all threads have ceased to exist

[03:41:47] <yuyua32> I was thinking to fix that I could just do y `notElemen` xs
[03:42:12] <EvanR> that's not the whole story
[03:42:29] <snake> yup programmers will never use your function before checking if y is an element of the list so you can be sure it will never crash when used properly
[03:42:37] <hpc> what error does it produce, and what line does it happen on?
[03:43:03] <yuyua32> Non-exhaustive patterns in function index
[03:43:19] <EvanR> if the list is very long or infinite, then sticking a containment test in front is kind of silly
[03:43:28] <yuyua32> its not gonna be long
[03:43:32] <EvanR> in the infinite case, it's just wrong
[03:43:41] <yuyua32> im guessing it happends at 1 + index n xs
[03:43:43] <yuyua32> when xs is empty
[03:43:49] <yuyua32> so
[03:43:54] <snake> maybe you can return a tuple (Bool, index)
[03:43:56] <yuyua32> | index n [] = 0
[03:44:01] <yuyua32> would that work?
[03:44:11] <snake> idk
[03:44:15] <snake> gonna shut up now
[03:44:22] <EvanR> 0 sounds like a false positive
[03:44:32] <yuyua32> shit true
[03:44:35] <nosewings> Probably not, because then you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between an element at the front and one not in it at all
[03:44:39] <nosewings> You could return -1
[03:44:44] <yuyua32> got it
[03:44:45] <hpc> depends on what you want index to return - maybe you decide that if (index n xs) > length xs, that means "not found"

[04:40:44] <snake> what is >>=
[04:41:07] <monochrom> As opposed to using "intuition" to ignore the exact type and handwave your way around.

[04:41:49] <nosewings> "m1 >>= \x -> m2" is the same thing as "do x <- m1; m2"
[04:42:12] <snake> ok thanks, not sure if i should start there or perhaps the learn you a haskell book
[04:42:43] <monochrom> When I teach Haskell I teach >>=, no "do". It works great.

[04:43:32] <EvanR> if it had modern css maybe people would not have forgotten about it

[11:53:44] <bahamas> c_wraith: that's what I mean. is there a different meaning (just curious)?
[11:54:16] <c_wraith> sure.  Maybe you mean the english phrase corresponding to a number, such that f "twenty-three" = 23

[11:55:59] <int-e> c_wraith: The strange thing is... I'd expect the trails towards a cycle to be about half as long as the cycle for a random function. So this... feels decicively non-random.
[11:57:08] <c_wraith> well, the problem had a lot of structure.  I'd agree it's non-random. :)
[11:58:27] <int-e> but then how can there be long cycles at all? it's a mystery :)
[11:58:38] <dminuoso> bahamas: You should really use `readMaybe` though.
[11:58:49] <dminuoso> `read` is one of those things I wish we didn't have.
[11:59:18] <dminuoso> It must be the number #1 source of bottoms causing crashes and misbehaviors, usually even from some transitive dependency..

[13:24:06] <lortabac> gensyst: I'll be honest, after spending a considerable amount of time on these problems, my advice is "don't"
[13:24:31] <lortabac> use Idris or Agda
[13:24:43] <gensyst> why? what happened :)
[13:25:00] <lortabac> or even better, just accept that you can't encode every possible invariant in the types
[13:25:45] <lortabac> gensyst: it gets **extremely complex** very quickly
[13:26:01] <gensyst> It stays less complex with Idris/Agda?
[13:26:26] <gensyst> Is this a limitation in Haskell that's here to stay on Haskell?
[13:26:36] <int-e> The type checker should be helping you, not vice versa.
[13:27:15] <dminuoso> gensyst: The limitation in Haskell is that type level programming is rather an artifact than a feature.
[13:27:34] <dminuoso> It just so happens that, after enabling a bunch of bolted-on extensions, you can do a bit of type level programming.
[13:27:59] <lortabac> do you know the "fraction of our power" meme? that describes the problem well :)

[17:34:39] *** Quits: xsperry (~xs@user/xsperry) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:36:38] <dminuoso> iphy: Is that not simply an algebra on the tree?
[17:37:40] <geekosaur> that's more or less what I'm wondering. I mean, the whole point of parsing into a tree representation is to enable such analysis
[17:38:02] <iphy> for example, I'd parse a C file into a list of top level declarations (comments, includes, functions, defines, #ifdef/#endif, etc.) and then re-parse the list of declarations into "includes first, defines and functions next, and everything should be wrapped in a header guard"
[17:38:24] <dminuoso> That does not sound like "parsing"
[17:38:29] <dminuoso> That sounds like a simple tree transformation.
[17:38:36] <dminuoso> i.e. `transform :: Tree -> Tree`
[17:38:41] <iphy> sort of, yes
[17:38:51] <iphy> except the output tree might be a different type, but sure, it could be the same type
[17:38:58] <iphy> and yes, it's a simple tree transformation
[17:39:05] <iphy> is there a "tree transformation" generator?
[17:39:17] <dminuoso> You mean a function?
[17:39:29] <dminuoso> I'm really unsure what you are looking for, that isn't covered by a simple function with pattern matching.
[17:40:05] <iphy> header ::= ifndef ID define ID include+ decl+ endif
[17:40:17] <iphy> that's what I want to express
[17:40:46] <iphy> header ::= ifndef ID define ID include+ decl+ endif { Header $2 $5 $6 }
[17:41:15] <iphy> or, maybe in haskell pattern matching syntax:

[17:43:26] <iphy> I'm not changing C programs, I'm parsing them

[18:02:32] <geekosaur> but tbh if I know a header is going to have that pattern I build it into the parser rules and the resulting AST will have your Header node
[18:03:29] <iphy> right, that's an option
[18:03:54] <iphy> but I was hoping to be able to do more pattern matching and analysis that way more easily
[18:04:06] <dminuoso> I would simply do this in haskell code.
[18:04:25] <dminuoso> Once you have your AST, you can transform it, and if the resulting data type changes, make it a simple `f :: AST1 -> AST2`

[18:13:21] <dminuoso> I think I have a broad understanding what you are trying to do here.
[18:13:36] <dminuoso> And it seems you should simply write this into your happy grammar.
[18:14:20] <dminuoso> Or potentially a separate pass, much in line with how macro expansion is implemented in C compielrs
[18:14:31] *** Joins: featurebug (~featurebu@49.205.122.91)
[18:14:53] <dminuoso> i.e. first parse the macro language into a MacroAst of course, and then parse the C bits and pieces separately

[18:16:11] <iphy> maybe I can turn ast nodes into the token type of a second happy parser
[18:16:32] <iphy> but I'd like to make many smaller parsers like this, used for various analyses
[18:16:58] <iphy> making many happy parsers seems a bit heavy
[18:17:02] <dminuoso> Something like `data MacroAst = Define T.Text T.Text | If T.Text MacroAst | C T.Text
[18:17:17] <dminuoso> And then `C T.Text` would be the raw C chunks
[18:17:50] <iphy> right, but that would be specific to one use case
