[06:05:59] <chatguy> ok
[06:07:11] <causative> moral conflicts are almost always dependent on conflicts over what the facts are
[06:07:49] <causative> hardly ever do you see two people who agree on literally all the relevant facts of a moral quandary, but take opposite sides in judging what is moral
[06:08:27] <causative> for example, abortion opponents tend to claim that the zygote has a soul, whereas abortion advocates say the opposite
[06:08:41] <chatguy> if it has a soul, then when it dies it will continue to live
[06:08:43] <chatguy> so what's the issue?
[06:09:30] <causative> well, the abortion opponents would say it's wrong to kill something with a soul because God said so
[06:10:02] <causative> which is also a question of facts - whether God exists or said that
[06:11:05] <causative> now - I say moral conflicts are dependent on conflicts over the facts, but it's not like people generally begin with a set of believed facts and derive their moral views impartially from that
[06:11:39] <causative> usually the process works the other way, or both ways - where people start with a moral conviction and then decide on what facts they would like to believe to support that conviction
[06:12:37] <causative> but still, even when engaging in that kind of motivated reasoning, the person's case would fall apart if it weren't for the "supporting" facts
[06:13:01] <causative> so - just get the facts right, and the morals will mostly follow
[06:13:32] <Delf> Or... don't have morals.
[06:14:56] <Delf> Replace them with sound values instead.
[06:16:42] <causative> ok Delf thumbs down on morals, thumbs up on values; and from earlier I know you're thumbs down on truth, thumbs up on facts
[06:17:44] <causative> you're just inventing your own private definitions for these common words
[06:18:33] <causative> most people understand that morals involve values, and vice versa
[06:19:21] <causative> "what are your moral views?" and "what are your values?" are almost the same question

[08:11:59] <Delf> I am NOT emotionally invested. But it is very human to be emotionally invested. Do you see the problem? Why people rather fuck at each other instead of trying to understand one another? They're busy classifying whether one is good or not and that's much easier, to stick people into boxes.

[10:41:52] <Delf> pussipupu: Maybe... What about if your following a manual written by an assholes or few... then you'd be better of reacting in defense
[10:42:58] <pussipupu> I don't understand, “following a manual” and “using logic” aren't at all the same thing

[10:46:55] <mrdata> a radical position isnt one held by the majority or even a large minority
[10:46:57] <arryana> i'm wondering what this person thinks 'the manual' contains
[10:47:04] <mrdata> so mask wearing isnt radical
[10:48:00] <mrdata> before covid, it may have been. but it is normal now
[10:48:49] <pussipupu> mask wearing and liking wearing masks aren't the same thing
[10:48:50] <Delf> It's only odd stance if you notice yourself doing it, otherwise it's... standard behavior and whenever you have fucked up emotions, it's because of others... when they ask questions or say things that make you seem.. less bright.
[10:49:00] <pussipupu> Though it's also true that many people seem to like wearing masks

[10:53:53] <arryana> i'm about to go find a tea
[10:54:23] <arryana> beliefs change with new evidence/information all the time
[10:55:13] <pussipupu> Especially if you view yourself as someone whose opinions change, interestingly
[10:56:15] <inhahe_> that is interesting
[10:56:32] <Delf> Suppose I'm emotionally invested in my belief and they're not based on logic that I consciously understand. They're based on my ability to "know my place", my ability to organize, to fall in line, and to listen to others, because I'm inferior. And I'm not even consciously aware of doing this. And I'm content with it. And here comes you using logic, questioning and in the process makes me look
[10:56:34] <Delf> stupid because I don't know how to answer it and it seems trivial and easy to answer... but I fail.
[10:58:07] <Delf> Part of me, will recognize the dangers in what you're saying and will resond accordingly, in defense. If I don't disengage, I risk having my internals, emotions, my whole sense of self and purpose in life... to be put in question. This is something very heavy to go through
[10:59:21] <pussipupu> I thought the topic was one using one's logic to examine and possibly modify one's own beliefs
[11:00:29] <Delf> Yes. I just wanted to say that... it might be asking too much, from certain people.
[11:01:23] <Delf> A lot of people have religious affiliations
[11:03:44] <pussipupu> I'm sorry but I'm not following this at all
[11:05:35] <Delf> Don't be. I talk about things that I consider to be important to the subject. They can be offtopic too.
[11:05:57] <arryana> this just looks like a random assortment of assumptions about how some imaginary 'other people' think.
[11:06:57] <arryana> still not coherent, from where i sit
[11:11:29] <Delf> ot
[11:12:53] <Delf> It's good to use logic to examine. Belief change as a consequence.. Our brains try to calculate what is most probable, the pros and cons.
[11:13:55] <arryana> what does that have to do with 'internal soup'?
[11:14:48] <Delf> I say religious mental thought patterns when we're operating in the same mode as we do when we're religious believers, following manuals. We can enter this mode even when we're the kind that likes to us logic to examine. Sometimes it just gets past us and we don't notice it.
[11:15:45] <arryana> i still have no idea where this magic 'manual' you keep referring to is, or what you think is in it.

[20:17:23] <I_Am_M00t> I just notice a similar thought structure in a lot of conspiracy theorist thinking
[20:18:42] <I_Am_M00t> and yes, i think there is something that glues them together, and i think that style of thought creates a breeding ground for nasty thinking
[20:19:38] <I_Am_M00t> they complain that others hate to think critically, yet their own thoughts seem to be very poorly organized
[20:20:11] <biys> conspiracy theorists.
[20:20:13] <I_Am_M00t> i think it's just stress and fear that causes a lot of conspiracy theories to pop up, they're fantasies people build up to cope
[20:20:25] <biys> so are you saying that if humans didn't exist, climate change wouldn't either?
[20:20:56] <I_Am_M00t> even though there are important points to be made on the topics they bring up, those points get buried in hogwash
[20:21:31] <biys> and you would say you don't fall into the category of people you just described?
[20:22:30] <I_Am_M00t> and yea, it's the same deal with religious people. Although there are important points to be made about the nature of life, religious people often muddle the discussion to the extent that those points can't be discussed
[20:22:53] <I_Am_M00t> with religion, the important questions are tied to politics (and often nationalism, racism, etc)
[20:23:23] <biys> so #woke
[20:23:48] <I_Am_M00t> that's the real issue nobody likes religion - not because nobody likes to contemplate existence, but because the religious community smuggles in nasty ideas in the backdoor
[20:23:57] <I_Am_M00t> through the backdoor*
[20:24:12] <biys> no one likes religion but so many people identify as being part of some religion or another
[20:24:19] <biys> idk what you think you mean
[20:24:58] <biys> i would say your own perceptions of religion are allowing you to make claims about religion that aren't really true
[20:25:09] <biys> so i would say you fall into the category of people you described above
[20:25:41] <audrey> Maybe don´t harass people online, I_Am_M00t
[20:25:49] <audrey> in response to <I_Am_M00t> i've been harassing a few antivaxxers online
[20:26:08] <audrey> this doesn´t accomplish anything, wastes your time, wastes their time, entrenches both parties´  pre-existing beliefs
[20:26:44] <biys> audrey: pretty much more or less anything I_Am_M00t types is for the purpose of causing some kind of emotional response
[20:26:51] <biys> you should see their chats on another network in another ch annel
[20:26:59] <audrey> if massive government and media campaigns to promote the vaccine haven´t managed to sway a person, it´s unlikely that your harassment will accomplish it
[20:27:01] <biys> they come here and masquerade as being some kind of admirable person
[20:27:12] <biys> i've said it before and i'll say it again

[20:30:54] <audrey> «Not even irreligious» is kind of where I´m at these days

[20:31:54] <biys> elevate the importance of religion?
[20:32:01] <audrey> in the same way that it might raise eyebrows to call yourself «disbeliever in Zeus» or «non-believer in horoscopes»

[20:42:11] <Ungwelian> It's kinda difficult :/
[20:42:37] <biys> i kind of think that the current state of things is built on the back of religion

[20:42:58] <I_Am_M00t> biys: I guess my main exposure is with people who identify as "christian" or "muslim"
[20:43:05] <audrey> Well, assuming you´re vaccinated, all that person is dointg is putting themselves at increased risk, not you

[20:43:28] <Ungwelian> I'm thrice vaccinated, but also in one of the highest risk groups.
[20:43:49] <Ungwelian> And with aging parents too.
[20:43:50] <audrey> since it appears that the vaccine does not prevent you from transmitting the disease to other people
[20:44:08] <I_Am_M00t> audrey: except it kind of does decrease transmission rates?
[20:44:17] <pussipupu> It reduces infection, severity, and transmission
[20:44:28] <pussipupu> no vaccine is 100% on these things
[20:44:42] <audrey> Unvaccinated people are primarily a risk to themselves and other unvaccinated people.
[20:44:59] <audrey> At this point, if you are unvaccinated in any Western country, it´s pretty much because you´ve made a conscious decision to remain unvaccinated.
[20:45:33] <pussipupu> only if you ignore people who can't for whatever reason get vaccinated or who have compromised immune systems that don't respond strongly
[20:45:52] <audrey> Which is not in your best interests, but hey I´m not gonna micromanage your lifestyle choices.
[20:46:01] <I_Am_M00t> the question is what to do, some countries seem to implement curfews and measures directed solely at the unvaccinated
[20:46:04] <biys> this is a conversation i won't take part in.
[20:46:11] <audrey> either way COVID talk tends to degenerate pretty quickly in these kinds of chatrooms
[20:46:14] <pussipupu> And even successfully vaccinated people aren't at no risk, so on the aggregates it's not too be discarded
[20:46:15] <biys> i think it's oversimplified on both sides
[20:46:33] <biys> and i think that once you start removing a persons liberty to make decisions about their body and themself, it becomes problematic
[20:46:37] <biys> and that is all i'll say about that

[20:48:02] <Ungwelian> It's exceedingly frustrating to see that person defend the antivaxxing as "freedom", while at the same time it undermines health & freedom from others.
[20:48:05] <audrey> I can´t read those emojis on my chat client.
[20:48:16] <audrey> Either way, strongly encourage you to take the entire conversation elsewhere
[20:48:36] <audrey> We´ve been down the COVID discussion road before and it never leads anywhere productive; just people getting more entrenched in their prior beliefs
[20:48:40] <biys> the vaccine doesn't make it so you _CAN'T_ transmit the virus though...
[20:48:45] <audrey> If you want to duke it out, have at it! Just not in ##philosophy
[20:48:47] <Tintle> I am vaccinated, however, I will never agree with mandatory vaccine
[20:49:01] <audrey> ##philosophy-off is a good place for this
[20:50:19] <Ungwelian> Few people there it seems.
[20:50:46] <biys> not a conversation i'm willing to have because it's just so oversimplified it's nonsense
[20:51:01] <audrey> biys: Yes, that´s part of the reason I don´t want to get deeper into this
[20:51:13] <audrey> Even the «experts» frequently get it wrong in this area, so what hope do the rest of us have
[20:51:58] <biys> i don't even wanna respond to that
[20:52:11] <biys> because i mean... there was a time when we thought we knew all theer was to know about physics
[20:52:15] <biys> then we broke open the atom
[20:52:23] <biys> and my opinion is that vaccines are dysgenic to begin with
[20:52:33] <biys> we're increasing our reliance on something foreign
[20:52:40] <Tintle> We've already had many viruses... and did somebody ask you to show your polio certificate to enter a supermarket?
[20:53:04] <Tintle> Did somebody ask you to show your hepatitis vaccine certificate to enter a mall?
[20:53:16] <biys> i am fully vaccinated because we've already had dysgenic practices
[20:53:19] <biys> we can't stop now
[20:53:23] <biys> but that doesn't mean it isn't dysgenic
[20:53:36] <pussipupu> This sure looks a lot like dropping the subject
[20:53:40] <biys> ^ lol
[20:54:18] <biys> i'm trying to figure out the boys triggers when it comes to the girl
[20:54:36] <biys> it seems like if i hug the daughter and walk away the boy will get jealous or upset and attack her in some way or another
[20:55:04] <biys> she's such a suck though cause it seems like all her teeth are coming in at the same time
[20:55:15] <biys> she's been teething for months
[20:55:22] <biys> and it makes her very unpleasant to be around
[20:55:50] <audrey> :(
[20:56:11] <I_Am_M00t> idk, what was the original focus anyway? i was broadly thinking about conspiracy theorism

[22:57:13] <biys> Ungwelian: i have read many critique
[22:57:53] <biys> i find it interesting, however, that you move to the critique prior to reading the book
[22:58:10] <biys> it's an interesting process when it comes to consuming literature
[22:58:39] <biys> firstly, you're not consuming the literature prior to formulating a position
[22:58:49] <biys> you're looking for critique on the literatior prior to consuming
[22:58:52] <biys> that seems like a backwards process
[22:59:16] <I_Am_M00t> what book is this?
[22:59:55] <biys> it's kind of like saying: "i'm looking firstly for a position that validates my ideas"
[23:00:27] <biys> I_Am_M00t: you left the conversation, so i'm not sure why you'd be interested in it now
[23:01:22] <Ungwelian> biys, I have background in biology, and from what I read, it seems to me that you've become the victim of a predatory author.
[23:01:32] <biys> care to elaborate?
[23:01:44] <Ungwelian> The premise, the conclusion.
[23:01:51] <biys> how i have "become a victim to a predatory author"
[23:02:12] <Ungwelian> The book makes wild, sensational claims.
[23:02:17] <biys> which claims?
[23:02:19] <biys> hah
[23:02:31] <Ungwelian> For example that humans will become enslaved by robots.
[23:02:42] <Ungwelian> And will become robots too.
[23:02:47] <Ungwelian> Just because of genemodding.
[23:02:49] <biys> is that what it says in the book?
[23:02:53] <biys> which page?
[23:02:59] <I_Am_M00t> Ungwelian: what book are you talking about?

[23:04:19] <biys> ooooh
[23:04:23] <biys> you're reading someone elses critique
[23:04:25] <biys> gotcha
[23:04:34] <biys> so it isn't even your first hand undertanding of the book
[23:04:42] <biys> you can't really provide any evidence
[23:04:46] <Ungwelian> Of course I didn't read the book in an hour.
[23:04:56] <biys> yet you're talking about it like you've read it
[23:05:01] <biys> this makes sense!
[23:05:08] <Ungwelian> Are you saying that the book doesn't make these claims?
[23:05:15] <biys> i'm asking you for the page
[23:05:21] <biys> you were the one making the claim
[23:05:22] <biys> not me
[23:05:24] <Ungwelian> You're the one who has read it.
[23:05:48] <biys> on which page are these claims you're suggesting made?
[23:05:51] <biys> that is all i'm asking
[23:06:06] <biys> like i said, i have the book in front of me
[23:06:16] <krb> theres more to living forever than just solving aging
[23:06:19] <biys> i'd like to read the exact section you're claiming to have first hand knowledge of
[23:06:29] <biys> re-read
[23:06:35] <Ungwelian> Then it should be easy for you to say if these general topics are established in the book.
[23:06:57] <krb> the sun will explode, theres a infinite amount of exploding suns and black hole guns. and then theres the possible end of the universe
[23:06:57] <biys> is this how it works in your world?  you make a claim about what the book says without providing even a page number?
[23:07:05] <biys> then you expect me to validate/invalidate it?
[23:07:07] <krb> and meteorites
[23:07:08] <biys> heh
[23:07:17] <Ungwelian> I'm not going to read hundreds of pages without having a preliminary idea of what is said.
[23:07:24] <biys> mmhmm
[23:07:57] <biys> all i'm asking is which section of the book you're making reference to
[23:08:01] <biys> i'll flip to that page
[23:08:22] <Ungwelian> I like some of these alternative culture books. "The Giza Power Plant" was fun to read, for example. Doesn't mean that I believe it :)
[23:08:24] <audrey> Uhoh, has someone been called out for not reading a book they claim to have knowledge of ? :o
[23:08:29] <audrey> Hoŭ controversial
[23:08:32] <audrey> *How
[23:09:50] <Ungwelian> Another point is that, according to the critique, the author presents this RNA-DNA phenotype change as a kind of violent overthrowing.
[23:10:13] <Ungwelian> And induces, that humans would change the phenotype to robots via genemodding quite as violently.
[23:10:19] <biys> i guess this is how it works now days
[23:10:21] <Ungwelian> I mean, rationally: where are these robot masters?

[23:12:10] <audrey> If you could at least get this to an object level discussion that would be more productive than this.
[23:12:25] <biys> i agree entirely
[23:12:54] <causative_> well, it's the courtier's reply
[23:13:50] <biys> not really
[23:13:56] <biys> as in this case the critique is second hand
[23:14:11] <causative_> that's the courtier's reply
[23:14:13] <biys> it's essentially hear'say
[23:14:30] <biys> oh, beg your pardon

[23:15:41] <I_Am_M00t> biys: hmm, i'm reading the prologue, so it's basically a critique against transhumanist movements (robotics/AI, gene editing)
[23:16:18] <biys> okay
[23:16:19] <causative_> if the book is valuable, and for the general public, then reading it ought to enable you to make cogent arguments yourself, in favor of the points in the book
[23:16:37] <causative_> so it doesn't matter exactly what's in the book - it matters what you got from it, that you can use to coherently support the claims in it
[23:16:52] <biys> yes.  i outlined my position on that above.
[23:17:22] <causative_> ok
[23:17:32] <biys> i neither support or oppose JFG and the revolutionary phenotype.  i said it was a perspective
[23:18:24] <biys> this conversation is more-so about claims that what's happening right now, with regards to anything really, can be quantified as "good" necessarily
[23:18:29] <biys> as we trasncend space and time
[23:18:38] <I_Am_M00t> biys: i mean he's saying that transhumanist movements and supporting technologies might... kill off today's humans
[23:18:43] <I_Am_M00t> that's almost self-evident?

[23:18:56] <causative_> lots of things might kill off today's humans
[23:18:56] <biys> I_Am_M00t: yah, i really don't think he asys anything entirely outlandish at all
[23:19:02] <biys> it's simply a warning
[23:19:17] <causative_> but IMO, if humans don't advance, there is no purpose to our lives
[23:19:35] <causative_> if we were to fall back to the iron age and stay there for a billion years - we wouldn't have achieved anything, we'd just be waiting around pointlessly for a billion years
[23:19:44] <I_Am_M00t> biys: well... i haven't read the book, so... even if that claim is true, i can't really judge his full viewpoint
[23:19:49] <causative_> it would be better to spend a thousand years in the space age than a billion years in the stone age
[23:19:54] <I_Am_M00t> that view isn't really controversial, it's kind the plan
[23:19:59] <I_Am_M00t> it's kind of the plan*
[23:20:04] <biys> that's assuming, causative_, that the primary purpose of existence is to progress
[23:20:08] <biys> which... i mean.  maybe
[23:20:25] <audrey> There´s a purpose to life?
[23:20:28] <biys> ^
[23:20:30] <audrey> Damn, that´s hella depressing.
[23:20:38] <audrey> Also where are you getting this from? Did you talk to God or something?
[23:20:59] <I_Am_M00t> well if there's no purpose to life, you can't really state that conserving humanity is important either
[23:21:10] <audrey> I don´t think conserving humanity is that important, either, fwiw.
[23:21:18] <audrey> But anyway I have to go to the park to enjoy this sunset
[23:21:19] <audrey> TTYL
[23:21:28] <I_Am_M00t> but then, transhumanist movements aren't really "wrong"
[23:21:30] <audrey> And try to behave while I´m gone; my scrollback doesn´t sleep.
[23:22:04] <I_Am_M00t> biys: do you think that there's no purpose to life?
[23:22:19] <causative_> whether there's a purpose or not, we certainly have *preferences* for one outcome over another
[23:22:31] <biys> do i THINK?
[23:22:37] <biys> what do you mean?
[23:22:44] <causative_> and sometimes our preferences can be inconsistent, or fail to achieve the higher-order preferences
[23:22:46] <I_Am_M00t> do you think that there's a purpose to life?
[23:22:51] <biys> think
[23:22:59] <causative_> thus, some preferences are irrational, and some are more rational
[23:23:04] <I_Am_M00t> yea biys , lol
[23:23:21] <Ungwelian> Even the prologue of that book contains apocalyptic warnings.
[23:23:22] <I_Am_M00t> anyway, i don't see a point in reading the book if that's all it's saying
[23:23:27] <causative_> we might say that the "purpose" of life can be what a rational person would prefer as the outcome of life
[23:23:49] <I_Am_M00t> it's saying "humanity might end if we continue with AI/gene editing", my response is... "ok"
[23:24:00] <causative_> again, everybody has preferences - it's just a question of which sets of preferences make more sense than others
[23:24:05] <causative_> they don't all make an equal amount of sense
[23:24:07] <biys> I_Am_M00t: i THINK only what i am capable of thinking of based on my intersectionality and the indoctrination i've been exposed to
[23:24:26] <I_Am_M00t> Ungwelian: i mean, of course it does
[23:24:43] <I_Am_M00t> biys: ugh... what?
[23:25:02] <biys> what does it mean to "think" ?
[23:25:08] <I_Am_M00t> so based on what you said, do you think there's some primary purpose to life?
[23:25:37] <I_Am_M00t> biys: lol, i don't know where you're going with this ;)
[23:25:37] <biys> i was born in a very religious house-hold.  the purpose of life is to pretend to be a good person so i can go to heaven and spend eternity with god.  methinks
[23:25:46] <causative_> and I'd argue that having a preference for some sort of advance for humanity, makes more sense than a preference for having humanity just persist for a long time without significant change
[23:25:54] <causative_> it's more rational
[23:25:54] <Ungwelian> "You are indeed holding a book which portends the end of DNA-based life on Earth.
[23:25:56] <Ungwelian> Most of the technology required to implement this carnage has already been developed and there are no international laws keeping anyone from using it."
[23:26:11] <biys> i think wheeler says something like... perception is the information and the processor
[23:26:16] <causative_> time only matters because of the events that occur in it
[23:26:22] <Ungwelian> Per my experience in genemodding and human rights, that's a wild claim that simply isn't true.
[23:26:26] <causative_> if nothing much happens, then it's as if little time passed
[23:26:34] <I_Am_M00t> biys: you brought up the idea that there might be a primary purpose to existence, maybe it's progress, maybe it isn't. And then you kind of referred to audrey's questioning of whether or not there's a purpose to life
[23:26:41] <causative_> if a *lot* happens, that's more interesting and valuable than if it just repeats the same kind of situations over and over
[23:26:43] <biys> I_Am_M00t: no i didn't
[23:26:48] <biys> i've never said there's a purpose to anything
[23:27:08] <biys> if i did it might have been sarcasm
[23:27:54] <biys> my official position on the matter is...  the only reason i "think" the things i do... is because of my indoctrination and my intersectionality
[23:28:32] <causative_> to which you apply your reason
[23:28:41] <causative_> some things you were told as a kid don't make sense, so you stop believing them
[23:29:34] <causative_> it's not just what you were given, but what you make of that
[23:30:36] <biys> this is why i have such a hard time with supposed atheists as well
[23:30:51] <biys> because the underpinning of more or less everything they know has religious context
[23:31:03] <Ungwelian> Also this "gigantic, genocidal battle" between RNA and DNA doesn't mention, that there are still both RNA and DNA virii around. Plenty of both.
[23:31:06] <biys> the thoughts, ideas, concepts they hold as being true have origins
[23:31:10] <Ungwelian> RNA-based organisms are definitely not extinct.
[23:31:14] <biys> those origins are likely associated with some religion at some point in time
[23:31:33] <Ungwelian> In the lab we worked at, a person researched RNA-based organisms for use in agriculture, IIRR.
[23:32:31] <causative_> who cares if the origin of an idea was at one point in time religious
[23:32:42] <causative_> Gregor Mendel was a monk, does that mean genetics is religious?
[23:32:58] <causative_> what matters is what the idea means in the present and whether it is consistent with observations, and true
[23:33:23] <biys> Spinoza says to know God we need to know how everything around us works (more or less)
[23:34:00] <biys> but this is more-so a critique of those who consider themselves athiest
[23:34:21] <causative_> everybody's an atheist about almost all the gods
[23:34:26] <causative_> there have been thousands of gods people have worshipped
[23:34:39] *** Parts: omero (~omero@idlerpg/player/omero) ()
[23:34:43] <causative_> Christians are 99.9% pure atheist... because they disbelieve in 99.9% of gods
[23:34:55] <biys> most atheists claim to be void of any religious significance
[23:35:10] <causative_> what does that mean, "void of any religious significance"?
[23:35:29] <biys> you'd have to ask I_Am_M00t on this one
[23:36:45] <biys> ask an atheist how they upholdt he moral beliefs they do
[23:36:53] <causative_> I'm an atheist, ask me
[23:37:02] <biys> it'll be something intrinsic
[23:37:21] <causative_> I have some high minded philosophical justifications for morality now
[23:37:30] <causative_> for much of my life I didn't have those justifications and was trying to figure them out
[23:37:41] <causative_> I was raised atheist - nobody ever told me God would burn me if I sinned
[23:37:55] <causative_> but they did tell me it was wrong to hurt people, or steal, or murder
[23:38:29] <biys> exactly.  so you didn't formulate these ideas based on your own "thought"
[23:38:29] <causative_> and it was obviously true to me - it upset me, and still upsets me, when people hurt other people, or behave in ways that break "the rules" when those rules would be beneficial for everyone if followed
[23:38:47] <causative_> it wasn't because of any God though - they didn't tell me about that
[23:38:54] <causative_> they just said it was wrong and I agreed
[23:38:57] <causative_> it's also about how I feel
[23:39:00] <biys> the underpinning of the ideas originated somewhere though
[23:39:05] <biys> what came first?
[23:39:08] <biys> the chicken or the egg?
[23:39:10] <causative_> I would feel bad if I hurt someone - not because it would come back to me, but because I empathize
[23:39:16] <biys> maybe
[23:39:18] <biys> maybe not
[23:39:27] <biys> your formulation of that opinion is based on your indoctrination
[23:39:35] <causative_> and because I have strong views about what is "right" and what is "wrong"
[23:39:46] <biys> based on what you've b een told to think about "right" and "wrong"
[23:39:56] <causative_> perhaps these views are genetic - they are stronger than most people who say they're religious
[23:40:22] <I_Am_M00t> biys: you referenced the idea, nevertheless
[23:40:37] <causative_> it took me a long time just to accept that there's no objectively "right" grammar - that what I was taught as "correct" grammar is simply the grammar accepted among a certain group of high-status English speakers, taught to me so that I could learn to be one of that group
[23:40:39] <I_Am_M00t> biys: but putting that aside, the book isn't really saying anything revolutionary about the future
[23:40:51] <I_Am_M00t> biys: it might have some good ideas though, i don't know
[23:41:02] <I_Am_M00t> i don't see what the fuzz is about, maybe it has some scientific inaccuracies here or there
[23:41:04] <causative_> before I had that clear understanding, as a child, I just knew that saying something this way was "right" and saying it the other way was "wrong"
[23:41:08] <causative_> I had no deeper understanding than that
[23:41:26] <causative_> 'don't use "ain't" - it's wrong.'  That was the level of my understanding of right and wrong, as a child.
[23:41:48] <causative_> children believe what adults tell them are right and wrong - there doesn't need to be a god associated with it
[23:42:09] <I_Am_M00t> regarding the future, humanity may not exist anymore, and extreme gene editing might give rise to all kinds of fantasy creatures, for all kinds of purposes
[23:42:14] <causative_> and also they are influenced by their instincts and empathy not to hurt people
[23:42:35] <causative_> their ability to put themselves in someone else's shoes naturally guides them towards the golden rule
[23:43:03] <causative_> although people differ on that count - some are less empathetic, or less concerned about right and wrong
[23:43:05] <biys> I_Am_M00t: you read the book already?
[23:43:47] <biys> causative_: so you don't think children are born tabula rasa?
[23:43:53] <causative_> of course they are not
[23:44:06] <causative_> no one can reasonably think that now that we have neuroscience and genetics
[23:44:09] <biys> what do you think of the Vikings or the Spartans?
[23:44:26] <biys> how could, the spartans for example, consider throwing an unfit child to it's death?
[23:44:43] <causative_> well, I did say a lot about what we are taught as a child
[23:44:43] <I_Am_M00t> biys: why should I read it, is my question? in the prologue he says the book is about the RNA->DNA transition, and he also adds that gene editing may give rise to a DNA->SUCCESSOR transition
[23:44:46] <I_Am_M00t> i'm not interested
[23:44:47] <causative_> it melds with our instincts
[23:45:00] <causative_> if the adult says "it is only right to throw the weak to the wolves," the child may come to embrace that idea
[23:45:07] <I_Am_M00t> i don't disagree with any those things either, on the face of it
[23:45:12] <biys> I_Am_M00t: i think it's interesting that you think you can comment on the works without reading it is all
[23:45:14] <causative_> although they may also have some natural aversion to it
[23:45:15] <biys> *shrug*
[23:45:22] <I_Am_M00t> biys: like, what point were you trying to make with that book?
[23:45:29] <biys> I_Am_M00t: you left the conversation
[23:45:30] <I_Am_M00t> if you state that, then i can have a longer read
[23:45:35] <biys> i'm not going to reiterate it again
[23:45:48] <causative_> as a child I was very concerned about right and wrong, and I'd say it was because when someone hurt me, I wanted to be justified in condemnation of them - I wanted to be "right" and prove I was right, so that I could get help from adults in correcting the situation
[23:45:50] *** Quits: nitrowheels (~nitrowhee@151.49.191.20) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:46:10] <I_Am_M00t> biys: but i'm not commenting on the entirety of the work, i'm just saying that main questions he's asking (which are laid out in the prologue), simply don't appeal to me right now
[23:46:17] <biys> you think that your perceptions of right and wrong when you were a child were obtained organically without any influence causative_ ?
[23:46:19] <I_Am_M00t> i don't think he's wrong about anything, i don't have a criticism about it
[23:46:34] <causative_> so my idea of right and wrong was influenced by that - by wanting to establish right and wrong in such a way that I could get social support against my enemies
[23:46:36] <I_Am_M00t> it just sounds like he's making a few claims that seem to have validity (in a larger sense)
[23:46:51] <causative_> biys, I said a *lot* just now about the influences
[23:47:07] <biys> "as a child i was concerned about right and wrong"
[23:47:14] <biys> why were you concerned about right and wrong as a child?
[23:47:36] <biys> you say it's because when someone hurt you you felt some way or another about it
[23:47:44] <biys> your perceptions about being "hurt"
[23:47:55] <biys> were those organic perceptions void of influence?
[23:48:00] <biys> your perceptions of pain
[23:48:05] <causative_> compared to other children, I was concerned with right and wrong because of probably genetics
[23:48:08] <biys> do all people perceive pain in the same way?
[23:49:39] <biys> i'll give you an example
[23:49:42] <causative_> my perceptions of pain are genetic
[23:49:43] <causative_> like anybody's
[23:49:54] <causative_> you hit someone's finger, they feel pain - their biology makes that happen
[23:49:57] <causative_> not social influences
[23:50:00] <biys> oh?
[23:50:45] <causative_> any animal feels pain if you hurt it
[23:51:04] <causative_> well, any mammal at least, probably any vertebrate, invertebrates are a grayer area
[23:51:25] <biys> my daughter seems completely undisturbed by the fact that the nails on her toes are ripped past the distal edge
[23:51:29] <biys> well into the nail plate
[23:51:48] <causative_> well, that doesn't hurt very much
[23:51:58] <biys> i did it a few weeks back
[23:52:01] <biys> it definitely hurts
[23:52:17] <biys> you've never lifted a nail?
[23:52:44] <causative_> I often cut my nails by scratching the edge of it with another nail until it makes a notch, so that I can peel from the notch across the end of the nail
[23:52:53] <causative_> and sometimes that goes into the quick
[23:52:57] <biys> and IIRC there's also significant amounts of literature about training your brain to feel less pain
[23:52:58] <causative_> it's not that painful
[23:52:59] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[23:53:36] <biys> hve you ever heard of Wim Hof ?
[23:53:46] <causative_> sure, you can train yourself to feel less pain, doesn't make the origin of pain any less biological
[23:53:58] <biys> it isn't about the "origin" of pain
[23:54:00] <biys> it's about perception
[23:54:16] <causative_> oh, the iceman, yes I heard of that guy
[23:54:36] <biys> are you saying Monks don't feel less pain?
[23:54:40] <causative_> no
[23:55:15] <causative_> I just said as much:  "sure, you can train yourself to feel less pain"
[23:55:40] <biys> so would the phrase: "you can train yourself to feel more pain" be just as accurate?
[23:55:55] <causative_> well, you could, though few would want to
[23:56:18] <biys> do you have control of what you're being trained to think during your early years?
[23:56:29] <causative_> to an extent
[23:56:31] <biys> between the ages of 0 and 5
[23:56:42] <causative_> somewhat
[23:56:49] <causative_> children don't just accept *everything* they are told
[23:56:57] <biys> they accept a lot, though
[23:57:00] <causative_> sometimes they will reject some things that don't make sense to them
[23:57:23] <causative_> if they can reject carrots they can reject what adults tell them
[23:57:27] <biys> i remember watching this prepper show where the kids thought it was completely normal to eat cricket flour
[23:57:38] <biys> i can tell you my son would be cricket flour averse
[23:57:52] <causative_> pretty much every parent tells their kid not to do crime
[23:57:58] <causative_> it doesn't sink in for everyone
[23:58:19] <biys> yet you think that the sense of right and wrong is intrinsic?
[23:58:21] <biys> biological in nature?
[23:58:41] <biys> and you think children aren't born tabula rasa
[23:58:51] <biys> in the sense that they have predetermined ideas about how to navigate the world?
[23:59:26] <causative_> it's partially biological, e.g. natural empathy or natural tendency for rule-following; partially about what you were told; partially about how your sense of reason interpreted and corrected what you were told to make it more consistent
[23:59:59] <biys> yes
