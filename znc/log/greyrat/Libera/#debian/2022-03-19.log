[01:36:15] <somiaj> karlpinc: "/run is mounted by the systemd program running as process #1. It is one of the so-called "API filesystems" that systemd mounts before it even begins to bring up services and targets."

[01:37:15] <karlpinc> somiaj: Thanks.  I was just going to look up the API filesystems.
[01:38:03] <karlpinc> I've a problem on a (very slow) system running mailman3.  It seems that on startup it has no permission to /run/mailman3/master.pid.  So startup fails.
[01:39:16] <Khepra> karlpinc: you need RuntimeDirectory=mailman3  in the service unit, so /run/mailmain3 is precreated and owned by User=
[01:39:24] <karlpinc> Perhaps this is because it looks like shutdown is failing also.  But the mailman3 unit has a PIDFile directive, so I'd think that systemd would delete the old pid after shutdown anyway.  I'm looking to set systemd dependences to fix it....
[01:39:47] <Khepra> afaik systemd doesn't touch pidfiles
[01:39:53] <karlpinc> Khepra: Is there a bug in the bts?  (Shouldn't this already be in the unit file?  I'll go look.)
[01:40:00] <Khepra> it should
[01:40:28] <Khepra> so it's either _that_ or you change mailmain3 config for another path for the pidfile. I've seen some incomplete service units like that, so it's not surprising
[01:40:54] <Khepra> I'd really love to type mailman3 instead of mailmain3
[01:40:55] <karlpinc> Humm.   Not there.  I'll put it in /etc/systemd.... and see if that fixes the problem and report a bug.  Thanks!
[01:41:21] <Khepra> you can put a drop-in with only that one entry under [Service] group.    systemd edit mailmain3.service   (or what's the service unit name)
[01:41:33] <karlpinc> Khepra: I've already got a drop-in.  I'll add it.
[01:41:37] <Khepra> the edit command will open the editor and save will save into a drop-in file
[01:41:41] <Khepra> ah k
[01:42:03] <karlpinc> Khepra: It needs dependences on the MTA also.  I'd file a bug, but have no idea if this can even be done in a generic fashion.
[01:42:24] <karlpinc> Khepra: There'd have to be a generic MTA.service to "depend on".
[01:42:27] <Khepra> karlpinc: probably not, esp. since Exim is default.
[01:43:03] <Khepra> karlpinc: thing is, unlike the shell scripts of the old, which were archaic and required pHd in bash,  systemd units are _meant_ to be tweaked by sysadmin

[01:43:31] <Khepra> I found a lot of units missing or incompelte. I tend to always write my own, and I mean full replacement under /etc/systemd/system/ , not just drop-ins
[01:43:32] <karlpinc> Khepra: It probably _could_ be done.  By having all the mta maintainers frob their service files to work with something generic.  And then there'd be a "generic service" to work with.
[01:43:54] <karlpinc> Khepra: Kind of sad state of affairs, if what comes with the system leads to race conditions on boot.
[01:44:01] <karlpinc> and shutdown
[01:44:04] <Khepra> karlpinc: technically yes, esp. sinc for postfix, for example,  postfix.service is a dummy that actually invokes postfix@-.service template
[01:44:16] <Khepra> so _that_ one could be generic-mta.service  something something
[01:44:30] <karlpinc> I'd be another whole "debian specific" thing.  Hard to say if it is worth it.
[01:44:47] <Khepra> it's not. the units are severely lacking anywy, so writing your own in full is recommended
[01:45:13] <karlpinc> Khepra: Sounds nuts to me.  I'm supposed to be able to install packages and have them work.
[01:45:22] <Khepra> because debian wants to sit on two chairs at the same time, it does neither of the approaches well enough. neither systemd nor sysv scripts. that's sad. but hey... the units are meant to be tweaked, so... ;)
[01:45:35] <karlpinc> Khepra: Life goes on.  :)
[01:46:03] <Khepra> bascially debian crippled itself with that last GR, instead of _mandating_ systemd as fully and only supportable init, and those five people who want sysv.... can do it themselves.
[01:46:42] <karlpinc> Khepra: Why would having the generating/whatever sysv stuff in systemd preclude having the rest of systemd "work"?
[01:47:02] <Khepra> karlpinc: because sysv doesn't have anywhere near the APIs and capabilities of systemd
[01:47:20] <Khepra> so for example, you can't write nginx to run as unprivileged, with caps and seccomp, because sysv can't do caps or seccomp
[01:47:30] <karlpinc> Khepra: So what's stopping the "just systemd" part from working?
[01:47:30] <kee> Systemd doesn't have anywhere near the capabilites of systemd, either.
[01:48:02] <Khepra> if systemd were the only supported init, debian would out of the box have .... _could_ have.... optimized and secured units. this way? it's halfassery.
[01:48:05] <kee> To actually get a systemd service to work properly, you need to write a custom supervisor in C that calls the systemd API.
[01:48:23] <Khepra> that's bs really
[01:48:54] <Khepra> I write all he .service units myself, I ignore packaged ones. configured to run unpriv where possible, seccomp'd, namespaced, apparmored, ....
[01:49:17] <Khepra> systemd does _that_ part, process management, with all those features, very well
[01:49:27] * karlpinc is bugged because nobody can tell me how to build a systemd target that does, say, exactly what multiuser.target does, but missing one component.  So that I can "partially boot", do stuff, and then go to the multiuser.target.
[01:49:44] <kee> karlpinc: Crash your system.
[01:49:51] <Khepra> karlpinc: I find the folks in #systemd very helpful.
[01:50:03] <kee> Systemd has a single-user recovery mode that you can use if you have a root password set.
[01:50:10] <kee> Just make enough services fail, and hey presto.
[01:50:50] <somiaj> karlpinc: I don't know if that is easily possible, since it is the units themselves that state what target they are in.
[01:51:07] <karlpinc> What I want is nothing involving recovery.  I want to use 2fa/etc to do stuff at boot time, manually.  (And then, having done so, have the system finish booting.)

[01:51:26] <somiaj> karlpinc: You might want to make a new target, my-multiuser.target, have it depend on multiuser.target and then those services you want missing you should assign to this new target.
[01:51:43] <Khepra> karlpinc: I'd use a custom service, as custom intermediary target would require all the WantedBy=multi-user.target   to change allegiance
[01:51:46] <karlpinc> somiaj: My work around is a new target, on top of the multi-user target.  I think.  It's been a while.
[01:52:03] <Khepra> with a custom service you can, in reverse, express dependencies FROM that unit to others, without the need to alter the others.
[01:52:07] <somiaj> karlpinc: yea, I think that is the way you have to go about it, otherwise you have to modify all the units.
[01:53:02] <karlpinc> On another note.  Is it "better" to leave the /run off of RuntimeDirectory=mailman3?  I kind of like the idea of being explicit.
[01:53:32] <Khepra> but that _is_ being explicit
[01:54:00] <Khepra> systemd precreates and pre-owns the dir for the .service to use, it's _the_ way to ensure service specific /run/ subdirs.

[02:01:24] <karlpinc> I wish I could watch more of the shutdown.  It takes more than a minute.  which means to me the dependences are wrong and something is shutting down before something else that needs it.  But that is for another day.

[09:21:31] <chubby-cactus> Hello All :^) I've just followed these instructions https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/134837/separate-boot-partition-on-usb?rq=1 and my machine has failed to boot. I corrected some errors the installer made, but all the UUIDs match in /etc/fstab /crypttab, all the filesystems and partitions are correctly formatted, and the installer installed correctly between both devices. What can I do?
[09:24:49] <sussudio> chubby-cactus: usb sticks are unreliable. don't use them for anything permanent.
[09:28:21] <chubby-cactus> Ideally, I can infinitely copy my /boot, and even manage multiple machines with one USB

[10:35:17] <PamiPetteri> wez, the same to you
[10:35:38] <PamiPetteri> how do I prioritize zramswap to replace the "hard drive swap"?

[10:36:38] <TeRRoR_MuDa> apt-get never worked for me
[10:36:56] <TeRRoR_MuDa> but then im like this isnt the old debian so yea
[10:37:09] <PamiPetteri> Khepra, how do I configure my zram?
[10:37:09] <Khepra> Heston: it's not
[10:37:42] <jmcnaught> apt-get is basically frozen because changing how it works will break too many scripts, so it's the one to use for scripts.  apt is improved each Debian release, including apt-patterns(7) as mentioned above.

[10:38:28] <Heston> makes sense
[10:38:45] <jmcnaught> You can use whichever one you want, but "apt upgrade" will install new kernel packages without requiring "apt-get dist-upgrade" or "apt full-upgrade", making it safer and easier to use.
[10:39:18] *** Quits: CaCode (~CaCode@user/cacode) (Quit: Leaving)
[10:39:24] <Heston> wouldnt those new kernel packages be pulled in as dependencies anyways?
[10:39:27] <jmcnaught> aptitude still has the best search of all of them in my opinion.
[10:40:26] <Heston> too many ways to do the same thing
[10:40:52] <Khepra> PamiPetteri: you install zram-tools and you configure /etc/default/zramswap
[10:40:53] <jmcnaught> "apt-get upgrade" will upgrade packages but not install new packages required as dependencies.  This is why you would see packages held back sometimes, requiring "apt-get dist-upgrade" which does install new packages, but can also remove them.

[11:29:49] <rudi_s> Or use scp?
[11:30:05] <Khepra> or that yes. newer openssh clients will actually use sftp in the backend of scp
[11:30:48] <alkisg> Thank you Khepra, I've been using scp so far, I saw here the other day that's it's getting deprecated, and I wanted a quick way to switch to sftp; rsync is fine, but I'm not sure it's preinstalled on e.g. Windows clients, so I'll need to structure some if/then else for my fingers auto-typing :D

[11:34:36] <aminvakil> i'm aware that after upgrading openssl library, nginx service needs to be restarted, so that it uses the new openssl
[11:34:51] <aminvakil> does reloading nginx work the same way?
[11:35:32] <Khepra> good question
[11:35:50] <aminvakil> afaik systemctl reload nginx, spawns a new nginx instance and new requests get to the new nginx instance until old requests are satisfied
[11:35:58] <Khepra> reloading spawns new worker processes. the master still does accept() which means the master is the one doing the TLS handshake? I think? could be wrong
[11:36:48] <Khepra> nginx does have graceful restart capabilities if you run it as root, so you don't lose any requests, for master process upgrade.

[11:59:26] <Khepra> SIGTERM or SIGQUIT if you set KillSignal=QUIT
[12:00:01] <aminvakil> https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.kill.html#KillMode=
[12:00:07] <Khepra> so basically, this unit I have.   stop (or restart) will send QUIT to the master, and will wait. if it doesn't shut down in predefined timeout, systemd thinks they hung and then KILLs master and all the children directly
[12:01:02] <Khepra> this timeout is TimeoutStopSec and I set it to 5 seconds.

[14:28:21] <IguanaBob> Aw. Too bad :/ Wanted to fix version numbers of packages but fail or at least warn me if they are different.
[14:28:24] <Khepra> that said... is there any particular reason you want that version on your debian?
[14:28:58] <Khepra> IguanaBob: you can force version in package name in apt install, then it'll fail
[14:29:24] <Khepra> apt install nftables=0.8.1.2.3.4   => E: Version '...' for nftables was not found
[14:30:00] <IguanaBob> I just tried it in general if I can assert specific versions of some packages. When maintaining servers I want to be informed about new minor or major versions (of some packages) and look into it. nftables was only an example.

[14:37:29] <Khepra> IguanaBob: well, you can, but by specifying verion in the package name, not preferences. Assuming the repos
[14:37:33] <kjetilho> I make apt-snapshots for QA testing.  it is quite simple, I just to rsync dists/bullseye to dists/2022/03/19/bullseye, and specify 2022/03/19/bullseye as the release name.
[14:37:36] <Khepra> still carry the specific versions you want.
[14:38:11] <kjetilho> so that way we can do QA runs for a few days, and then be sure to upgrade to the same packages in production which we tried in testing.
[14:38:24] <Khepra> running your own apt repo is another good solution, yes. you update it when there's need, you test the new packages, and then that becomes available to production in a controlled manner, ie. no race conditions like TOCTOU

[14:45:08] <Khepra> in general, for a pre-packaged binary distro like debian, you mostly do NOT want to fiddle with versions. the tip of the repos (current state) is tested and specifically intended. anything else can open up vulenrabilities or (re)introduce bugs, or make the entire installation come down burning in a dependency hell.

[14:46:40] <kjetilho> agreed

[16:21:18] <udaba> i have to reboot to solve this

[16:21:39] <udaba> i posted that on my language forum and some people told me thats maybe a systemd issue?

[16:32:23] <stdInOut> hello,  I wanted to avoid running sudo with 'make install', so I came across 'checkinstall', which was available as apt package, so I installed it and ran 'checkinstall --install=no --backup=no -D'..While the command was running, some files in /var/tmp were not permitted to be processed, and I was asked if I wanted to keep out the files in '/home', which I confirmed. at first, checkinstall also asked me to fill in and confirm a few things to start
[16:32:23] <stdInOut> creating documentation. After these, I happened to find out that checkinstall was not maintained for over 5 years! and this post reports horrible things that may happen upon running checkinstall; https://askubuntu.com/questions/1138384/why-is-checkinstall-no-longer-being-maintained
[16:32:24] <udaba> I cant find the error log now . As i told you my PC freezes at random moments when playing a game.Im noob and i though the reddit post had something to do with it because im getting similar messages only when upgrading kernel or nvidia-drivers.

[16:37:01] <Khepra> let's not confuse them now with sysrq things. let's first see the logs pertaining to the "freeze". it's unlikely that oom would "freeze" the pc
[16:37:22] <kee> It freezes mine quite consistently, with exactly those symptoms.
[16:37:42] <Khepra> and you have oom entries in kernel log?
[16:37:53] <kee> Lemme trigger it and check.
[16:38:19] <Khepra> which process was oomkill'ed ?  because the kernel will NOT kill the "one that tried to grab too much RAM".  It'll kill by rolling a dice, minus oomkill modifiers
[16:38:49] <kee> It always kills the right process on the machine where X.org doesn't leak memory.
[16:38:58] <stdInOut> can someone please respond? I see Khepra is busy, but is s/he alone here? if checkinstall is that old and therefore hazardous, how can it be available in apt?
[16:39:08] <abrotman> udaba: also, do look for firmware updates, that can sometimes help

[16:40:13] <kee> Khepra: I have a line saying oom-kill:constraint=CONSTRAINT … and another one saying Out of memory.
[16:40:21] <Khepra> stdInOut: if you're afraid by `make install`ing untrusted programs with files all over your system.... use contianers. that's why they're invented for :)

[16:40:40] <dpkg> well, cruft is a program to look over your system for anything that shouldn't be there, but is; or for anything that should be there, but isn't.  To install it, type apt-get install cruft.  It takes a while to run.
[16:40:57] <stdInOut> Khepra, can I please have an answer to the question that I asked?
[16:41:20] <abrotman> dpkg: debsums
[16:41:20] <dpkg> debsums is a utility that will check a package's files against their checksums.  The "-a" argument will instruct it to also check configuration files: "apt install debsums; debsums -a -s".  Almost all packages come with md5sums included in the package or apt will have generated them for you; generate missing ones with "apt-get install --reinstall `debsums -l`".  Ask me about <md5sums>.

[16:47:31] <kee> The freezing is when it runs out of memory but doesn't think it needs to OOM kill.

[17:17:53] <stdInOut> yes, I can spill coffee on my computer and hardware can get damaged, and all data, too.. what are you telling me?
[17:17:55] <abrotman> Download a binary game from the internet, run it as a user .. you have *zero* idea what it will actually do
[17:18:09] <Khepra> remember when microsoft installation scripts for.... "R" I think?  removed /bin/bash? pepperidge farm remembers.

[17:19:09] <Khepra> stdInOut: I think you're asking a question nobody here can aswer. do we _know_ if <something> has definitely damaged your files.  we don't. you can only compare to backups. you can only prevent fires in the future by using proper tools.
[17:19:09] <stdInOut> there is an explicit warning about this package. and you tell me, well it may happen with anything you do?
[17:19:42] <abrotman> stdInOut: I can write you a shell script that does damage to your $HOME .. so can you.  I'm not sure what you're getting at.

[17:21:13] <Khepra> there are no reported bugs for breaky/buggy behaviour :  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=checkinstall;dist=unstable  ; which doesn't mean there isn't any. just saying a random AskUbuntu post is not something I'd consider... trustworthy.
[17:21:15] <stdInOut> kee, I can give you a very proper answer for that. but it suffices to say that it is a repo package. and please do not join in.

[17:24:08] <stdInOut> the former post says the same about /HOME, that it messes up that, too

[17:25:22] <stdInOut> abrotman, if you dont see the difference between prevention of a problem entirely and fixing it after it happens...
[17:25:55] <stdInOut> yes, then really there is a different problem there. also not related to this topic.

[17:28:33] <ice9> how can I determine nvme interface type (M.2/PCIe) from the command line?
[17:29:19] <stdInOut> Khepra, for 1000. time, no. how can try that? I dont know if that is the case or not. I was here to ask if that kind of damage is what this program can do, and as I understand, the answer is yes
[17:30:01] <Khepra> stdInOut: right.
[17:30:32] <Khepra> I don't know for a fact. Doesn't seem impossible or unreasonable that messing with `make install` even in a confined env, could damage files inside that env.
[17:30:55] *** Quits: Fausto (~dante@gateway/tor-sasl/filohuhum) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[17:31:04] <Khepra> that's why checkinstall should be used in a disposable environment. chroots, containers, ...
[17:31:13] <stdInOut> a package that hasnt been maintained for 5 years.
[17:31:14] <stdInOut> http://checkinstall.izto.org/
[17:31:20] <stdInOut> even the url is http
[17:31:26] <Khepra> it's not the fault of checkinstall.  you can typo a rm-rf /home/user files/here   and that doesn't mean coreutils should be banned
[17:32:07] <Khepra> checkinstall only enumerates files installed. doesn't in any way make any promisees to contain or isolate or act as a security boundary, no? or does it?
[17:33:45] <stdInOut> I think it is a waste of time talking to you. you are brainless fanatics making up this miserable pretexts.

[21:42:21] <qqz> Debian refuses to load i915/kbl_dmc_ver1_04.bin after upgrading though the file is there
[21:42:36] <qqz> It should be the firmware for my graphics card
[21:43:03] <qqz> upgraded to bullseye
[21:43:11] <qqz> maybe something with the firmware loader
[21:43:29] <Khepra> any clues in dmesg?
[21:43:47] <qqz> http://pastie.org/p/6E0r8OwQHjQqnneLrJBoMz
[21:44:09] <qqz> (-2) is not very verbose as error code
[21:45:03] <qqz> can it be that it needs the i915 kernel driver to load the firmware? perhaps that one is loaded later on
[21:45:22] <Khepra> I think it's possible there's a bug in either the driver or the firmware
[21:45:35] <Khepra> you can replace that one file from kernel.org's tarball and see if that helps
[21:46:09] <Khepra> though that could potentially introduce other issues, as you should then replace the whole shebang of i915 firmwares from teh kernel.org tarballs
[21:46:35] <qqz> I would guess the driver as I have tried it with the debian firmware as well as the Mageia firmware which does not output an error on Mageia
[21:46:49] <Khepra> are they same version firmwares?
[21:47:05] <Khepra> and then you can try bullseye-backports kernel yes,

[21:48:22] <Khepra> I thought you upgraded to bullseye
[21:48:31] <Khepra> and also... rt? do you really need a rt kernel?
[21:48:35] <qqz> ahh, will need 5.10.0-12-rt
[21:48:39] <qqz> it is installed
[21:48:54] <Khepra> did you actually perform the proper upgrade procedure?
[21:48:56] <qqz> running update-grub
[21:49:18] <qqz> thx for the first help; will reboot and see if it is resolved
[21:49:22] <karlpinc> What's the "right way" to setup a systemd dependency so that a process does not start until postgres has opened it's socket and is ready to accept connectons?  (I've tried, simultaneously After= and Requires= for both postgresql.service and postgresql@.service and this does not seem to do the trick.)
[21:49:34] *** Quits: qqz (~odo@217-149-164-108.nat.highway.telekom.at) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[21:50:45] <Khepra> karlpinc: none. the only way to test "socket open" is to actually try and connect and fail refused. systemd has no facilities for that. HOWEVER, you could whip up a test script and shove it under the unit's ExecStartPre=
[21:50:50] <karlpinc> Is the whole @ thing messing me up and I need to declare a dependency on a particular postgres version, or is it just systemd starting things "fast" and not waiting for pg to open the socket or ....?
[21:51:01] <Khepra> karlpinc: the latter
[21:51:31] <karlpinc> Maybe I won't worry about it.  I get messages in the logs, but eventually the whole thing works so....
[21:51:34] <Khepra> "proper" systemd services would use sd-notify and notify BACK to systemd when they're ready. unfortunately, we don't yet live in that world

[23:31:34] <sney> you use pre and post hooks to stop and start postfix/dovecot as part of the process. see this example for haproxy, https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html#setting-up-automated-renewal
[23:32:00] <sney> and you can use systemctl instead of service, ofc
