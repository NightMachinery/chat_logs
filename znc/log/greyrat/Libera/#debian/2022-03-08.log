[01:01:45] <somiaj> Here I'm unsure, I don't see any bug reports about this, but the description of the stdlib is, "It is not normally used on its own, but as a dependency of python3.9", it could be that there is stuff collected here that could require additional dependencies like python3-tk in this case
[01:02:26] <somiaj> python3-tk is a rare widget set these days, most things don't use it, so I see why it isn't installed by default.
[01:02:43] <somiaj> I'm unsure why something that depends on python3-tk is included in the stdlib package, but you'll have to ask the python team about that.

[02:07:38] <Khepra> the module is still supported by python with no indication that it might be deprecated or surpassed by something else. it is, after all, THE python module to handle RFC compliant email messages (form, content)

[02:12:33] <kee> Email headers are practically identical to HTTP headers. Is email really not a network protocol?

[02:13:00] <Khepra> which "email" are you talking about? python module? it's not a "protocol". P in SMTP is a Protocol
[02:13:14] <Khepra> email has no functions to send email. it merely constructs the message which you then send via smtplib.
[02:13:28] <Khepra> it also has no functions to "receive" in that it cannot answer to SMTP(rotocol)
[02:13:43] <kee> It has functions to read emails.
[02:14:00] <Khepra> it has functions to _manage_ email _messages_. it has no ability to respond in SMTP
[02:14:01] <kee> That's fairly useless if you're just feeding it known-trusted emails; you can't use it to read the ones you've received.

[02:39:51] <greycat> are you asking us what package it's in *on ubuntu*?  how would we know?
[02:39:55] <Khepra> nickgaw: it's base-files and another iirc
[02:40:22] <greycat> also, installing a package analogous to login from a foreign OS onto Debian is VERY unwise
[02:40:31] <nickgaw> true
[02:40:32] <greycat> copying the raw file out of /etc/pam.d/ would be less intrusive, by a lot
[02:40:35] <kee> greycat: Isn't Ubuntu basically just Debian?

[02:41:10] <Khepra> nickgaw: it's the /etc/update-motd.d, part of base-files package and I _think_ used by the pam module

[02:45:27] <Khepra> nickgaw: so from what I gather, you need to comment out the "noupdate" line from /etc/pam.d/login, then you need scripts in /etc/update-motd.d/<here> that will be run by run-parts (so keep in mind the rules for that), with which you can construct the login motd.
[02:45:53] <Khepra> since by default it also uses the static /etc/motd, you can set it to empty, and then have an ordered update-motd.d/ script add it first or last, whatever you feel
[02:47:31] <Khepra> also be careful as some packages will install files under /etc/update-motd.d/  . you can get those packages with something like     apt-file search /etc/update-motd.d
[02:48:07] <Khepra> since that's /etc/ you can pre-empt emtpy filenames in those names, or just alter them post installation

[02:49:55] <nickgaw> Debian does not have update-motd packages.
[02:50:10] <Khepra> it's not a package
[02:50:30] <Khepra>  /etc/update-motd.d/ belongs to "base-files" package, and the pam module uses the dir
[02:52:22] <Khepra> and according to pam_motd(8) manpage, if you comment out the "noupdate" line in /etc/pam.d/login, the module will run scripts under /etc/update-motd.d/

[04:10:53] <Khepra> I want to use Raspberry Pi as a daily driver for a certain role. all it has to do is run firefox, pycharm, and a buncha terminals, under sway. can I do it with pure debian or am I really bound for raspbian?
[04:11:32] <kee> Debian should work fine.
[04:11:43] <kee> You need the proprietary GPU blob, of course.

[04:29:50] <somiaj> Khepra: look at http://raspi.debian.net/ for debian images. Also make sure you get one that can support arm v7 I think, some pi's their chips don't support that, and need special patches in the kernel, which is where raspbian comes into play

[04:30:48] <Khepra> somiaj: I see, thanks.
[04:31:25] <somiaj> I think most modern pi's will be fine, I just know there is some issue with some of the arm chips on them that makes it hard to support with a non-patched kernel.

[04:34:09] <karlpinc> Khepra: You can chase through the rpi 4 wiki to "some outside page" that says how to do it.  Basically, IIRC, either use a wired connection for installation or do a minimal install and then get wireless working.
[04:34:49] <trench> karlpinc: all depends on what version he has
[04:35:01] <karlpinc> Khepra: The only trouble is that you can't seem to get an rpi 4, or any rpi.  I've been waiting 2 months for a r4.  The r3 is supposed to be harder to get.
[04:35:18] <karlpinc> trench: Yes.  I'm only talking about the rpi4.
[04:35:35] <trench> karlpinc: rpi3 also supports wifi :>
[04:36:03] <trench> but I would rather get a pine64 instead of rpi
[04:36:21] <trench> they are faster and you don't any special blob
[04:36:52] <karlpinc> trench: But installing debian on it can't be done through the installer.  (My guess is you'd have to put rasbian on it and then use that to install.)
[04:37:15] <trench> and you don't need a dongle for a micro hdmi connection either

[12:32:12] <Khepra> sepulchralDrake_: the only way you can do this is having an external backup; install debian regularly; then pull data in from the backup
[12:33:50] <Khepra> can you do it in place? technically yes if you deleted all distro/packaged files and kept only your own data (eg, /home/, maybe stuff in /var/lib like postgres databases, maybe some /var/log files, ...), and then you can use debootstrap to "overlay" an installation atop of existin filesystem; but you really need to know what you're doing; plus I'm not sure if the selinux xattrs pose a problem
[12:34:20] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[12:34:23] <sepulchralDrake_> good point
[12:34:29] <Khepra> and also /etc and other configs will most definitely require reworking, so you can't even keep those.
[12:34:35] <Khepra> just... backup and reinstall normally :)
[12:35:22] <sepulchralDrake_> yeah will be the way then. i would have been nice to have not to redo the hardening but i already guessed i had to
[12:35:40] <Khepra> sepulchralDrake_: do you intend to run selinux on debian too?
[12:36:04] <sepulchralDrake_> anyhow first i need to get a plan if i will stick to the current hoster or move away
[12:36:23] <sepulchralDrake_> neither used selinux on the centos machine

[12:37:14] <sepulchralDrake_> did a lot of other hardening on the machine - but to be honest i am still not getting the idea behind the selinux part
[12:37:41] <sepulchralDrake_> and surely didn't invest to much time to understand it in detail
[12:37:58] *** Joins: spare (~p6v7jzsnh@user/spareproject)
[12:38:05] <Khepra> well it's very simple. it renders UIDs obsolete and irrelevant. every process needs a context, and every context needs a policy in what it can do to any other context. that's basically it. it's super good stuff.
[12:38:40] <sepulchralDrake_> sounds so
[12:38:44] <Khepra> like, doesn't matter if something is run as root. root is impotent in a properly done, strict policy selinux system
[12:39:15] *** Quits: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[12:39:29] <sepulchralDrake_> should really invest some time to that topic
[12:39:35] <Khepra> it's worth it
[12:40:26] <Khepra> but if you intent do stick to debian, there's apparmor. it's also a MAC framework, but in many ways different from selinux, and in many ways easier to write policies and maintain them; but in general there's very little prepackaged policies, you'd have to write most of them yourself.
[12:40:44] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[12:40:49] <sepulchralDrake_> oh ok
[12:41:31] <Khepra> I mean there's selinux on debian too, but in my experience it's an afterthought and hard to get set up properly. the packages simply aren't tested to work in a selinux-by-default environment.
[12:42:05] <sepulchralDrake_> i will compare both - it might be that i will come to the conlusio that both might be an overkill and the other hardening i had done is sufficient for my level of required security
[12:42:49] <Khepra> that's possible too. I find systemd's service unit's security options quite good and covering vast majority of hardening that, for example, I want to do.
[12:43:34] <Khepra> I use apparmor as a second layer atop of that (proper security is in-depth, onion-like layering, not a boolean) to make things even more strict; or when a .service unit is not available (user run stuff)
[12:43:48] <sepulchralDrake_> on all the current Centos installs i manage the selinux needed to be disabled anyway as the some software was messing around with it - but as those machine has been part of a domain that software was essential
[12:44:15] <Khepra> cPanel?
[12:44:21] <sepulchralDrake_> true the more layers to breach the longer it should take

[13:05:28] <willow> much better to do an actual backup of any database then restore on the new system
[13:06:50] <willow> trying to in-place switch from centos -> debian is asking for major headaches if not disaster
[13:07:21] <jelly> depends on how good you are, possibly only minor headaches
[13:07:48] <willow> someone advanced could possibly do it
[13:08:50] <jelly> I wouldn't call it advanced, just take care to use the exact same or newer version of the db with the exact same set of features/options available, or more
[13:09:36] <willow> i could see a lot of permissions issues for one thing
[13:11:15] <willow> for example the perms set for different daemons can be complex.  may require one or more users/groups.  maybe require special perms on different directories...
[13:11:40] <willow> do you just drop in a new unit file and expect it to work?

[20:06:02] <kittonian> hi all. i read about the policykit vulnerability this morning and am trying to check my server to ensure I'm not at risk. I'm running the latest bullseye with all the updates, but it appears that if I apt-get install policykit-1 it is not installed. I thought it was installed on all installation since 2009? Am I missing something?
[20:06:34] <jelly> kittonian, it's not always installed.

[20:36:30] <jelly> frost-core, have you had a positive experience with ANY modern 64bit distro?
[20:36:39] <frost-core> id say Lubuntu
[20:36:51] <frost-core> and Mint XFCE which is what im running
[20:37:19] <frost-core> all of the distros except for debian
[20:37:30] <frost-core> and no custom repos debian based distros
[20:37:37] <frost-core> why do they not work?
[20:37:38] <jelly> to gauge how new it is, which kernel version is that mint xfce using?
[20:37:53] <frost-core> jelly : i run 19.3, so 5.4
[20:38:04] <jelly> your hardware platform is crap and noone can support it well
[20:38:04] <frost-core> the latest probably uses 5.11
[20:38:12] <jelly> that's why they don't work
[20:38:31] <rawtaz> so i changed the security line in apt sources to what kittonian suggested, and i also made sure that there are no other sources list files (e.g. in the .d folder), but despite that theres no sign of getting 5.10.92-2 from apt: https://kopy.io/l7M1s (the one mentioned at https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0847 ). any ideas why that would be?
[20:38:47] <rawtaz> is there perhaps some apt cache i need to clean out
[20:39:45] <jelly> frost-core, my take is, it would probably take serious work to make a modern kernel and xorg work decently again, and that work can be used to make $$$ and buy something with a proper intel gpu, haswell or newer
[20:40:26] <jelly> frost-core, if I knew you personally I'd literally send an old sandybridge thinkpad to use that instead
[20:40:54] <silly> i'm not ready to give up my gma500 netbook
[20:41:07] <silly> i'd even buy the same again

[20:41:28] <silly> nope
[20:42:02] <kittonian> rawtaz, that's very strange. it's definitely available. in fact, I just updated from -1 to -2 before coming into the channel
[20:42:10] <silly> eww t420
[20:42:47] <rawtaz> kittonian: i have two other machines nearby here, will try it on those as well :)
[20:42:55] <rawtaz> FWIW i totally trust what youre saying. so yeah its just odd
[20:43:23] <jelly> frost-core, well.  If you can install openssh-server somehow (pull disk out, boot on a different machine, install and set up things), then put it back into the N2800 system, maybe you can generate some logs we can look at an try to make 64-bit work
[20:43:32] <silly> kittonian, rawtaz looks like my security line in sources is wrong too
[20:43:43] <rawtaz> silly: what do you have?
[20:43:49] <silly> i remember reading about the change somewhere
[20:43:55] <silly> same as you did
[20:44:08] <silly> i'd expect it to fail if it's wrong
[20:44:10] <rawtaz> yeah they changed from like a security-specific domain to the same as the other lines, i recall
[20:44:13] <jelly> frost-core, if you can boot a different 64bit distro while debian installation is present you might be able to mount debian, chroot and install things as well
[20:44:35] <rawtaz> silly: does that mean you havent gotten the update, 5.10.92-2, either?

[21:45:23] <rawtaz> thanks to you; thanks very much!
[21:45:38] <randall> rawtaz: If you don't already use config management software, I can recommend ansible to regularly verify that all the packages you need are installed as they should.
[21:45:55] <rawtaz> yeah i need to get started with that stuff
[21:46:16] <randall> ansible has a very low entry barrier, as opposed to chef/puppet and the others.
[21:46:32] <rawtaz> i just have an itch with it - the fact that you need to clean up as well. its not like Nix where you just define how everything should be and it makes it happen. so i think ansible and salt as well arent really great in that regard
[21:46:49] <rawtaz> yeah, ive used it a little before. just never got to using it regularly
[21:47:07] <randall> You need to clean up with ansible? In what sense?
[21:48:21] <rawtaz> to clarify; e.g. if your playbook creates some files and some user and edits a line in a file. then you want to not have those anymore, and the edit in the file gone. then you need to update the playbook to have like present:false or similar, and not sure how to deal with the changed file..
[21:48:32] <rawtaz> so you end up with a playbook that contains stuff you DONT want. thats rather dirty IMO
[21:48:56] <rawtaz> of course when you have the luxury of just redeploying the entire system you dont need to be bothered by this, but when you dont have that infra it becomes messy

[21:49:39] <randall> rawtaz: Ah, I see. IMHO that's seldomly the case, you can sometimes just do an ad-hoc play for that to remove those. Or do it by hand.

[22:37:35] <sceptttre> Hello. I'm installing bullseye and I'm at the "[!] Software selection" step. I want this to have XFCE, so I selected that option but quickly thought, what is this "Debian desktop environment" that is selected by default? Which environment is it?
[22:37:45] <sceptttre> So I read the guide (https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/amd64/ch06s03.en.html#di-install-software)
[22:37:56] <sceptttre> and it mentions, "By default, debian-installer installs the Gnome desktop environment."
[22:38:18] <somiaj> sceptttre: it is generic stuff that is included for all desktops
[22:38:34] <somiaj> so usually that is selected + the desktop you want. If you select that and no other desktop, then gnome gets installed
[22:39:32] <sceptttre> I see. So what happens if that is not selected AND at the same time one of the other options is selected, xfce, for instance?
[22:39:41] <sceptttre> Or mate, cinnamon, whichever
[22:39:57] <somiaj> You are allowed to deslect that? I thought it was automatically selected when you selected a desktop.
[22:40:05] <greycat> The installer presents you with a task selection dialog menu toward the end.  GNOME is selected by default.  If you don't want it, it's easy to un-select it.  You'll either want to select a different DE, or un-select "Debian desktop" as well, or else it will choose a DE for you, and it will probably choose GNOME.
[22:41:15] <greycat> I do not understand the rationale behind having a "Debian desktop" selection which does something unknowable, but I didn't get a vote.
[22:42:19] <sceptttre> somiaj .... I pressed "continue" right before you asked that. I don't know. I just figured one could deselect that one but perhaps as soon as one selects one of the other options, it is selected automatically
[22:42:35] <sceptttre> I can try this at another time. It'd be interesting to know
[22:42:44] <greycat> You can un-select it.
[22:42:58] <sceptttre> greycat how are these things decided btw?
[22:43:16] <somiaj> yea, I always unselect everything and just install a minimial system, and install software I use aftwards.
[22:43:18] <greycat> Probably a committee.  Who knows.
[22:43:38] <somiaj> But I think the generic desktop enviorment is select in conjunction with another choice.
[22:43:49] <somiaj> You can run 'tasksel' after the install to get that menu back if you really care

[22:44:34] <sceptttre> somiaj well, i could do in one of my other computers right now but... wouldn't that install the software when i press continue? lol

[22:52:28] <somiaj> To me it isn't cryptic, just select the desktop you want.
[22:52:43] <somiaj> If you want to install xfce, select xfce, if you don't want to install gnome unselect gnome.
[22:54:36] <sceptttre> ..... I thought you understood what my question was given that you answered but it might've been a sheer coincidence
[22:55:28] <sceptttre> The "select / deselect" is clear
[22:55:35] <kee> If you don't install task-desktop but you install a desktop environment, nothing much happens.
[22:55:37] <sceptttre> Wait...  have you ever seen the menu prompted by taskel?
[22:55:53] <kee> Iirc, the overall metapackage is just "make sure you have at least one DE installed".

[22:55:55] <sceptttre> If you don't install task-desktop but you install a desktop environment, nothing much happens. << either you're wrong or somiaj is wrong then lol
[22:56:20] <sceptttre> since according to somiaj, "and if you look at task-xfce-desktop, it depends on task-desktop, so that will be installed if it is selected or not if you select xfce"
[22:56:27] <sceptttre> which to be fair, that makes sense to me

[22:56:55] <kee> In which case we're both *right*.
[22:57:24] <sceptttre> yes and 2 + 2 = 5, right?
[22:57:24] <greycat> If you're trying to ask "What happens if I unselect Debian desktop, but leave GNOME selected", the answer is "I don't know, why would I do that", and I think kee is saying that it won't be noticeably different from having both selected.
[22:57:41] <kee> greycat: That's exactly what I'm trying to say.
[22:57:55] <sceptttre> "and if you look at task-xfce-desktop, it depends on task-desktop, so that will be installed if it is selected or not if you select xfce" != If you don't install task-desktop but you install a desktop environment, nothing much happens.
[22:58:16] <kee> I mean nothing much happens as in, it's not noticeably different from installing task-desktop and a DE.
[22:58:32] <sceptttre> still *something* happens, right?
[22:58:34] <kee> I didn't know about the dependency situation, which makes it even *less* difference.
[22:58:48] <kee> The only difference is whether the A flag shows up in aptitude-curses against task-desktop.
[22:59:13] <kee> That's assuming tasksel doesn't just mark it manually-installed anyway.
[22:59:20] <sceptttre> Still a difference, right?
[22:59:33] <sceptttre> Tick vs no tick
[22:59:49] <kee> Yeah. But you will never notice it.
[22:59:52] <greycat> If you're so deeply curious about what happens when you do unusual things in the installer, try it and see.  Most of us don't try unusual things in the installer.
[23:00:20] <greycat> We're more likely to be able to tell you how to achieve common goals.
[23:01:01] <kee> Just tested it!

[23:01:37] <kee> Deselecting task-desktop when it's installed does `install task-desktop-`.
[23:01:46] <kee> Note the - after task-desktop.
[23:02:01] <kee> So, ultimately, nothing much happens except it being unmarked as manually installed.
[23:02:45] <sceptttre> Yeah. But you will never notice it. << that's besides the point. There was still a bit flipped somewhere to have that option install in the background regardless of what my selection was
[23:03:17] <sceptttre> I gotta go though. It was a fun chat. Thank you all for your help

[23:08:02] <johnjaye> i had a problem booting my debian just now. it said something about waiting for suspend resume to finish
[23:08:31] <johnjaye> then a message about blocks it checks on /dev/sdc4 (the root partition). then some text flashed and i got the login. where do i find that text that flashed in red?
[23:08:43] <kee> Probably systemctl.
[23:08:51] <johnjaye> not dmesg?
[23:09:05] <kee> dmesg is just for kernel messages iirc.
[23:09:05] <johnjaye> ok. i didn't see it in dmesg so i was confused
[23:09:06] <greycat> so there wasn't actually a problem -- it worked?
[23:09:13] <johnjaye> yes but it booted slow
[23:09:25] <kee> systemctl has all the information that systemd has access to, including the contents of dmesg.
[23:09:32] <kee> It's the world's worst pager, though.
[23:09:33] <greycat> journalctl should have it
[23:09:45] <johnjaye> like it should show a login. not sit there for 30 seconds wtih a message about suspend/resume waiting failed
[23:09:46] <kee> Ah, yeah, I'm thinking of journalctl, sorry.
[23:09:52] <johnjaye> is it because i'm using 'reboot' to shutdown?
[23:09:53] <kee> systemctl is for listing services. :-)

[23:13:35] <johnjaye> ok i found the problem in journalctl. it's failing to mount the swap partition due to fstab having the wrong UUID
[23:13:49] <johnjaye> i thought i fixed this before. how can the UUID change?
[23:15:22] <johnjaye> should i just change it back to /dev/sdc2 ?
[23:15:43] *** Quits: shtrb (~shtrb@user/shtrb) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:15:57] <somiaj> did you run update-initramfs after fixing the uuid in fstab?
[23:16:23] <LoRez> '
[23:16:41] <johnjaye> i don't know. i made these changes awhile ago
[23:16:46] <johnjaye> i just noticed the slow booting now though
[23:17:09] <somiaj> well check that the uuid is fixed in your fstab file, and if the uuid is correct, update your initramfs (I think uuids propgate to there so it can mount things early)
[23:17:36] <johnjaye> meaning even if change it in fstab it still might not work on reboot unless i do update-initramfs?
[23:18:12] <somiaj> Yup
[23:18:17] <johnjaye> ok sec

[23:18:59] <somiaj> yea, etc/fstab is located in my initrd image, so it will need updated
[23:20:22] <johnjaye> interesting. i got an error about that
[23:20:41] <johnjaye> it says initramfs-tools sets swap to the invalid UUID but that doesn't exist
[23:20:47] <johnjaye> or a warning rather since it says W:
[23:21:02] <johnjaye> "but no matching swap device is available"
[23:21:11] <johnjaye> but i changed fstab

[23:26:18] <alkisg> There's a resume.conf somewhere under /etc/initramfs.tools, can't search now; after updating the uuid there, run update-initramfs -u
[23:27:47] <johnjaye> it was in conf.d/resume. literally one line saying the swap uuid
[23:27:54] <johnjaye> that's pretty impressive alkisg

[23:34:43] <somiaj> passwd and shadow have the same thing
[23:34:56] <kjetilho> you can delete it if you like, but it can be useful in an emergency.  e.g. /etc/passwd or shadow is b0rk
[23:35:35] <dokma> I'm going through my /etc to remove old gunk. /etc/group backup is a good thing. Will leave it.
