[07:27:18] <rud0lf> if i like big cats, can i say "I'm fond of big cats"?
[07:27:37] <rud0lf> or does fond carry some context unknown to me?
[07:27:48] <rud0lf> like... emotional?
[07:32:50] <CuriosTiger>  You can say "I'm fond of big cats".
[07:34:39] *** Joins: kerfluffy (~kerfluffy@user/kerfluffy)
[07:36:00] <rud0lf> thank you
[07:36:06] <rud0lf> i'm fond of you, too ;)
[07:47:43] <LuisP18> fond of our tiger here? :3
[07:49:35] <rud0lf> :)
[07:49:39] <rud0lf> fond of all tigers
[07:49:53] <rud0lf> except for tony the tiger, i don't like frosted flakes ;P
[07:50:54] <LuisP18> lol
[07:51:45] <LuisP18> guess you'd say ... they're greeeeat .. not :>
[07:51:56] <rud0lf> they're grrrrross
[07:52:12] <LuisP18> lol :P
[07:52:37] <rud0lf> do you know what's the difference between small cat and a big cat?
[07:52:45] <rud0lf> big cats don't purr while inhaling
[07:52:53] <rud0lf> small cats do it both ways
[07:53:15] <LjL> big cats don't purr while ingesting you*
[07:53:15] <rud0lf> and i think one of big cat's doesn't purr at all
[07:53:16] <LuisP18> hm, interesting
[07:54:13] <rud0lf> a cute fact, when a cub attacks adult lion for fun, they (adults) growl and roar mimicking pain to raise cub's self esteem
[07:55:30] <roo-> A not so cute fact, when an adult lion attacks a cub for fun, they tend to die
[07:56:15] <rud0lf> to raise the adult lion self-esteem? :P
[07:57:30] <roo-> They say it's their natural tendency... wiping out other males' offsprings, more room/resources for their own
[07:58:45] <twb> Is ANYONE surprised that cats are assholes?
[07:59:08] <twb> They literally carry a disease that makes humans like cats
[07:59:28] <LjL> i'm not sure that's their fault
[08:03:12] <roo-> rud0lf: A more interesting fun fact about stray domestic cats... they know how to use mirrors and interpret shadows naturally
[08:05:02] *** Joins: Samian (~Sami@174.27.107.153)
[08:08:31] <pussipupu> They carry a parasite that on average makes male humans more tolerant  the smell of cat piss and female humans less
[08:08:31] <rud0lf> i knew about mirrors, i've seen a compilation of cat recations a while ago
[08:08:49] <pussipupu> Which isn't really the same as liking cats .þ
[08:08:53] <rud0lf> the cat was shown a face filter of his owner, that changed their (owner's) face to a cat's muzzle
[08:09:07] <rud0lf> and the cat looked back at their owner to see if that's real
[08:09:19] <roo-> You've seen stray or non-stray cats?
[08:09:21] <rud0lf> cats and dogs are also aware of tv picture
[08:09:29] <rud0lf> non-stray
[08:10:11] <roo-> Non-stray cats having such abilities is not that surprising, since they have their entire life to be familiar with them and experiment
[08:10:32] <roo-> My experience is with stray cats that naturally don't have access to such things, and they do that naturally
[08:11:03] <rud0lf> also, cat's that never seen mirror are only afraid of image in vertical mirrors
[08:11:16] <rud0lf> they are used to image in the water surface as they drink
[08:11:54] <pussipupu> The plural of “cat” is “cats” not “cat's”
[08:12:40] <twb> pussipupu: I was referring to toxoplasmosis gondii
[08:12:48] <LjL> twb, he knows
[08:12:55] <pussipupu> twb: I know
[08:13:33] <pussipupu> That's why that's what I responded to :þ
[08:13:46] <LjL> also it appears to make you less risk-averse in stupid ways
[08:13:51] <pussipupu> Also cats make us like them by being lovely
[08:13:55] <LjL> which is probably a bigger problem than making you liking cats, or their piss
[08:14:23] <twb> It makes you more likely to get hit by a bus also
[08:14:31] <twb> Since it lowers your motor reaction speed
[08:14:46] <twb> It *doesn't* make you climb to the top of a tree and wave at eagles, though
[08:14:50] <LjL> if mine got any lower i'd literally uh

[08:15:40] <rud0lf> i used to type what i think
[08:15:48] <roo-> rud0lf: Here's an example with shadows, my balcony is very high, 3 floors up, how the cats that are on the ground floor know to look at me immediately as I go to the balcony?
[08:15:52] <rud0lf> but i practiced spoken english a lot lately
[08:15:59] <rud0lf> and now i type what i _hear_ in my head
[08:16:11] <rud0lf> i have to re-learn everything :/
[08:16:23] <LjL> i've noticed as i got a bit more familiar with english pronunciation and more able to actually undertand spoken english, which used to be a sore point, i've simultaneously started to make more typos on homonyms
[08:16:24] <rud0lf> roo-: mhm
[08:16:39] <LjL> the "your"/"you're" kind that's irksome, and that i thought i'd never do because i just know the difference too well
[08:16:44] <rud0lf> LjL: yes, i think because of same reason
[08:16:50] <LjL> and i did, until my brain started being used to them sounding the same!
[08:17:29] <rud0lf> because you're used to be visual sensation, then it became audial (?)
[08:17:38] <rud0lf> is there even such word as "audial"?
[08:17:49] <roo-> rud0lf: They see my shadow on the building next to mines, and they immediately look up to my balcony. They can do that only when the sun gives away my shadow, other times they are clueless
[08:18:06] <rud0lf> little smart beasts
[08:18:16] <LjL> auditory
[08:18:26] <pussipupu> There's *audible but what you're looking for is...
[08:18:30] <pussipupu> What LjL said :þ
[08:18:32] <rud0lf> cats also have bad fame of being less loyal and loving than dogs
[08:18:35] <rud0lf> which is not true
[08:18:58] <rud0lf> they just show their feelings different way, and there's social misinformation bias to it
[08:19:05] <pussipupu> Cats don't understand personal space and do tongue kisses when you're sleeping
[08:19:15] <rud0lf> like everyone automatically says "ewwwww" at the idea of pineapple pizza
[08:19:15] <pussipupu> Genuinely the worst behaviour of any of our cats
[08:19:16] <LjL> i gave away a cat because i had never had a pet before and after a few months i realized i just couldn't deal with him and i still feel shitty about it :(
[08:19:20] <rud0lf> which is actually not that bad
[08:19:40] <rud0lf> i just don't like hot moist fruits/vegetables like pineapple or cucumber
[08:20:02] <rud0lf> LjL: you didn't click together :)
[08:20:19] * pussipupu hugs LjL
[08:20:31] <LjL> we stressed each other. he ended up poking a hole in his fur, and i ended up poking a hole in my hair
[08:20:49] <rud0lf> a furhole
[08:20:53] <LjL> but he was lovely when he wasn't randomly attacking my but ;(
[08:20:54] <LjL> butt*
[08:21:11] <LjL> yet, i value my ability to sit without cat teeth in my butt
[08:21:26] <rud0lf> butts are eternal enemies of cats
[08:21:35] <LjL> feet too
[08:21:36] <roo-> Not very common for cats to bite as an attack
[08:21:39] <rud0lf> they purr sometimes but they're not cats
[08:22:15] <LjL> roo-, well he never *really* bit me, though i don't know if that's because he wasn't really trying, or just because i jumped out of the chair quick enough. what i know is that my behavior of jumping away enabled his behavior of making me jump away
[08:22:19] <rud0lf> i've also learned that dogs "sneeze" when they want to show that growling and biting is not serious during play
[08:22:35] <rud0lf> i thought before they just randomly hit their noses or something
[08:22:50] <LjL> "just don't show him he's won" - easy to say, hard to do if you're scared of a little beast aggressively wanting to show he can take your chair
[08:23:28] <LjL> and he really just wanted to do that... there could be a chair next to mine, but he didn't care, he just wanted to evict me from mine
[08:23:33] <rud0lf> the worst thing are cub's teeth... sharp like needles
[08:23:46] <rud0lf> teeth/fangs
[08:23:58] <rud0lf> i think there's english word for animal teeth
[08:24:04] <LjL> he was young, not entirely sure his age, but probably gave him away when he was one year old or so
[08:25:09] <pussipupu> Animal teeth are teeth
[08:25:33] <LjL> i guess fang is technically a type of tooth?
[08:25:35] <roo-> I think it has more to do with cubs having a tendency to bite... I don't really think that one that experienced a bite from an adult cat can say: "good thing it wasn't a cub"
[08:25:48] <pussipupu> Yeah, fang is specifically the long piercing teeth
[08:26:19] <LjL> roo-, yeah fro what i've heard/read, kittens bite each other "lightly" for play, problem is they don't realize human skin is more vulnerable
[08:26:25] <pussipupu> Adult cats generally know how to bite without hurting in my experiece
[08:26:35] <LjL> i've read some advice to actually pretend to be more hurt than you are when they bite
[08:26:54] <roo-> pussipupu: Without hurting implies that's a play/game not an attack
[08:27:00] <pussipupu> Yeah, I'd stand by that advice
[08:27:08] <LjL> but i'm not sure, that could cut (bite?) both ways... if the cat is playing, then it'll think "oh okay i bit too hard", but if it actually wants to hurt you then you'll show it has accomplished the goal
[08:27:28] <pussipupu> roo-: Yeah, they will also if taught what hurts humans do play attacks with sheathed claws
[08:28:08] <LjL> i was just terrified though when he went ears down, pupils dilated, on that damn bunk bed
[08:28:27] <LjL> didn't look like playfulness, he looked possessed ;(
[08:29:03] <pussipupu> Yeah, our monster goes full-on dæmonspawn
[08:29:24] <pussipupu> Visually
[08:29:50] <LjL> he got along best with my mom, ultimately, even though she's the one most scared/grossed out by animals in the family
[08:30:09] <LjL> they had a ritual where morning couldn't really start before they had nose-kissed
[08:31:01] <roo-> I wouldn't get my face close to the face of an animal I consider aggressive
[08:31:52] <LjL> roo-, i don't know if you could call him aggressive beyond the quirks of most any cats. i think i was just more scared than the average human, and he took advantage of that
[08:32:04] <LjL> there was *one* time he drew any amount of blood from anyone
[08:32:27] <LjL> and that was on my mom, as a matter of fact, but only because she dared take away his empty bowl. he had a very special thing for food
[08:32:36] <roo-> Even if its not really aggressive and just being playful aggressively... putting your face/eyes on the line, sounds too much of a risk
[08:32:37] <LjL> definitely possessive on food
[08:32:54] <LjL> roo-, he was just in a different "mode" when he was like that. you could tell.
[08:33:06] <LjL> when he was all purring and wanting cuddles it was pretty clear
[08:34:07] <pussipupu> Time to brave the outside world, be well cat lovers
[08:34:17] <roo-> :)

[10:15:56] <Babar> is it? It doesn't seem a reduction at all, is it not literally the person's argument?
[10:16:21] <twb> I don't think so.
[10:17:39] <twb> I think the claim is more that urban-fantasy-vampires are in no way based on real vampires
[10:18:13] <twb> (Though they are probably based on D/s and rape fantasy and all that, which is discussed in other posts)
[10:18:52] <Babar> oh
[10:19:29] <Babar> the person started the whole tirade as a response to "Why are vampires sexy?" where their response was "They are not", and proceeded to list real-life blood-sucking animals
[10:20:10] <twb> Babar: well that question wasn't automatically asking about urban fantasy vampires
[10:20:28] <twb> Although I can see that's the implied context
[10:20:35] <Babar> fair enough, I suppose if you consider those real-life animals as vampires, then your understanding is applicable
[10:21:05] <Babar> although aside from vampire bats, I probably wouldn't, and even with the bats, the connection is purely through the name :D

[10:56:48] <StayHungry> blood-drinking practices (as food, as medicine, as rejuvenating fetish, as life force of defeated enemies…) predate all those scientific observations. then a projection takes place and folklore entities inherit traits. then a corpse is exhumed with blood pushed out of the orifices by gases. everything gets mixed up. so 'anthropomorphic vampires' are way older in terms of descriptive existence.
[11:15:07] <twb> StayHungry: also related to corpse disposal in sub-zero conditions
[11:17:47] <StayHungry> the very obvious answer to 'why vampires are sexy' is this: it makes easier to extract the life force out of the victim, because suave seduction trumps violent abduction.

[13:51:22] <tinsoldier> Etch A Sketch is a mechanical drawing toy invented by André Cassagnes of France and subsequently manufactured by the Ohio Art Company and now owned by Spin Master of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. An Etch A Sketch has a thick, flat gray screen in a red plastic frame. There are two white knobs on the front of the frame in the lower corners. Twisting the knobs moves a stylus that displaces...

The left control moves the stylus horizontally, and the right one moves it vertically. The Etch A Sketch was introduced near the peak of the Baby Boom on 12 July 1960 for $2.99. It went on to sell 600,000 units that year and is one of the best known toys of that era. In 1998, it was...

[20:23:25] <LuisP14> such debatable thing in spanish (lemon/lime)
[20:23:54] <twb> darsie: pets are usually gendered, work animals may be, meat animals rarely
[20:23:55] <darsie> StayHungry: I mean for unknown sex.
[20:24:36] <twb> If an animal's sex is unknown, "it" is acceptable in English
[20:25:02] <Babar> yeah, animals of unknown gender aren't gendered
[20:25:08] <Babar> are they in some other languages?
[20:25:14] <Babar> e.g. dog always being male or something
[20:25:14] <LjL> yes
[20:25:17] <darsie> Yes, in German.
[20:25:24] <LjL> pretty much any language that has grammatical genders
[20:25:51] <CuriosTiger> Yep. German dogs are all male, cats are all female.
[20:26:02] <CuriosTiger> grammatically, anyway :P
[20:26:09] <pussipupu> Death to grammatical gender </obligatory>
[20:26:20] <darsie> Not always. Dogs are male in German, but Susi in Susi und Strolchi is female.

[20:29:09] <masoudd> wow :D
[20:29:20] <CuriosTiger> So in German, you would literally say: "Do you see that young woman? It's coming this way."
[20:29:46] <darsie> CuriosTiger: Der Hund von Georg ist ein Weibchen. Er heisst Susi. Susi ist schnell. Sie hat eine Maus gefangen.
[20:29:51] <CuriosTiger> (This is because of a grammatical rule in German that makes all diminutives neuter, regardless of the gender of the root noun.)

[21:06:54] <furrykef> The origins of Indo-European gender aren't too poorly understood, I think.
[21:07:04] <furrykef> It began as an animate/inanimate distinction.
[21:10:43] <pussipupu> Finnish has distinct animate/inanimate verb-er noun forms which I quite like
[21:11:13] <pussipupu> Though animal is eläin, which is the inanimate one (liver)
[21:11:36] <pussipupu> So maybe it's person Vs not person or something
[21:13:02] <furrykef> Japanese has an odd animate-inanimate distinction... it's only used with one pair of verbs, "aru" and "iru", meaning "to exist" or "to be [in a certain place]".
[21:13:49] <furrykef> The money is on the table: Okane wa teeburu no ue ni aru.
[21:14:03] <furrykef> The cat is on the table: Neko wa teeburu no ue ni iru.
[21:14:10] <furrykef> Since a cat is animate, you must use "iru" instead of "aru"
[21:15:38] *** Joins: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess)
[21:16:15] <furrykef> We also know the history of this particular quirk of grammar, since Japanese is attested before the distinction was made. Originally "aru" could be used with anything and "iru" (or rather "wiru") meant "sit".
[21:21:08] <pussipupu> Seems like a dark way of giving someone sad news about their cat is available in Japanese

[21:30:50] <pussipupu> Sounds right at least!
[21:31:14] <huf> what's the form for "he/she lives"?
[21:32:22] <huf> ooooh does the finnish word for "understand" have anything to do with standing?
[21:36:47] <pussipupu> "elää", which is the same as the infinitive
[21:37:09] <pussipupu> I don't think so at least
[21:37:20] <huf> same as the infinitive, how strange..
[21:38:21] <pussipupu> Apparently it comes from a PG word for "around", as does the word for "around"
