[04:49:42] <ii14[m]> I don't understand the question
[04:49:46] <ii14[m]> what do you mean by capture
[04:51:27] <sszark> ii14[m]: When you use `!%some_command` it prints into your buffer. I want to do the same for lua calls basically.
[04:52:07] <ii14[m]> I don't understand what the percent symbol does
[04:52:15] <ii14[m]> do you mean `%!`?
[04:52:19] <ii14[m]> so the other way around
[04:52:23] <sszark> I thought doing `%lua cmd()` would work. But i assume the `!%` is some special combination.
[04:52:25] <sszark> Yeah sorry.
[04:52:49] *** Joins: off^ (~off@64.253.22.77)
[04:53:44] <ii14[m]> `%` is a range, means the entire buffer when placed before a command, like in this case `!` command, and when it's placed after it usually means the current buffer filename
[04:53:58] <ii14[m]> no, that won't work with lua
[04:54:48] <ii14[m]> give me a minute, because I have a custom command that does this, but maybe there is an easy way to do it
[04:55:25] <sszark> Sounds good. I've been writing some text generation functions. I just need a way to insert it into the document.
[04:59:31] <ii14[m]> add this to your config: `command! -nargs=+ -complete=command Put call append(line('.'), split(execute(<q-args>), "\n"))`
[04:59:42] <ii14[m]> and then `:Put lua ...`
[05:01:54] <sszark> I'll give it a try. thanks!
[05:02:02] <ii14[m]> you should be able to use any command with that
[05:03:44] <sszark> Would this be for a lua config? or is that vimscript. I'm getting syntax errors.
[05:04:33] <ii14[m]> `vim.cmd([[command! -nargs=+ -complete=command Put call append(line('.'), split(execute(<q-args>), "\n"))]])`
[05:04:35] <ii14[m]> for lua
[05:04:48] <ii14[m]> previous one was for vim script

[12:43:18] <kylo252[m]> @desdic, it's worth mentioning that depending on the server/linter, you might be able to set additional logging. it would be something like `--verbose`. since that would differ from server to server, you'd need to override the default command used by lspconfig
[12:43:23] <desdic[m]> I have the trace now but there is no errors since the error is the index in diagnostic.lua

[12:44:49] <mjlbach[m]> if the line/character number are missing from all diagnostic notifications, then it will cause the error
[12:45:37] <kylo252[m]> desdic[m]: which linter wrapper are you using? or can it be used directly by gopls or something?

[13:03:42] <kylo252[m]> if you clamp the results earlier, wouldn't that remove the need to do it again at the diagnostics side? 
[13:04:19] <mjlbach[m]> That's a bad idea for a variety of reasons, the solution is to patch the language server
[13:04:58] <mjlbach[m]> you should only ever clamp in the display layer, the true cache needs to be preserved for code actions

[13:07:45] <mjlbach[m]> I don't think the appropriate solution is clearing the diagnostic cache
[13:08:01] <kylo252[m]> more prevalent is probably get_diagnostics not updating immediately after you fix a violation, so the lsp-sign kinda gets stuck
[13:09:02] <mjlbach[m]> That should never happen, except with null-ls or rust_analyzer

[19:04:00] <p00f> can i highlight only function definitions and not calls?
[19:04:45] <p00f> (I'm trying to port https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster)
[19:06:10] <saltrocklamp[m]> <ii14[m]> "https://github.com/neovim/neovim..." <- ty!
[19:06:41] <saltrocklamp[m]> p00f: you'd need two different syntax groups i think? i'm not sure if there's a way to "conditionally" highlight otherwise
[19:07:02] <p00f> there's only `Function`
[19:07:25] <ii14[m]> with treesitter and whatnot?
[19:07:33] <ii14[m]> or just vim syntax highlighting
[19:08:16] <p00f> just vim? nvim-treesitter also defines only `TSFunction`
[19:08:40] <ii14[m]> I think treesitter should differentiate between definitions and calls somehow
[19:08:46] <p00f> and I don't think I'm willing to hook into treesitter myself
[19:08:51] <ii14[m]> with just vim, depends on the syntax
[19:09:00] <saltrocklamp[m]> with nvim tree sitter, i believe you can add new highlight groups, and then write a query to highlight function definitions differently from function calls
[19:09:13] <ii14[m]> what filetype do you want it for?
[19:09:57] <p00f> all?
[19:10:05] <p00f> i'm making a colorscheme
[19:10:12] <saltrocklamp[m]> syntax definitions vary wildly by filetype
[19:10:17] <saltrocklamp[m]> both with vim and treesitter
[19:10:17] *** Quits: samgranieri (~samgranie@user/samgranieri) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[19:10:23] <ii14[m]> yeah that might not work
[19:10:28] <saltrocklamp[m]> i'd recommend starting with 1 file type that you understand well
[19:10:42] *** Joins: Galladite (~Galladite@host-92-24-75-159.as13285.net)
[19:11:02] <ii14[m]> so for example for lua, when you're in lua file, you can run `:filt /^lua/ hi` to see all lua highlight groups
[19:11:03] <saltrocklamp[m]> with tree sitter, you could write a query like (e.g. with python) `(function_definition name: (identifier) @funcdef-name) @funcdef` and then map the `@funcdef-name` capture to a new highlight group of some kind
[19:11:13] <ii14[m]> and you might find groups for function calls there
[19:11:16] <ii14[m]> or not
[19:11:16] <p00f> saltrocklamp[m]: the builtin queries define only `function` and `method`
[19:11:33] <saltrocklamp[m]> i am saying you would need to write your own query (example above) and map the capture to a new highlight group
[19:11:40] <p00f> saltrocklamp[m]: yeah no I'm not doing that for all filetypes
[19:11:40] <ii14[m]> so you'd have to do it per language
[19:12:05] <saltrocklamp[m]> there's no general solution for "all filtypes" because the tree sitter syntax tree is defined differently for every filetype
[19:12:17] <p00f> saltrocklamp[m]: i know
[19:12:19] <saltrocklamp[m]> and once you get into traditional vimscript highlights, things are even more irregular
[19:13:05] <saltrocklamp[m]> so my suggestion is to at least define the new highlight group and TS capture group in your plugin, and give users instructions to add support for their preferred languages
[19:13:11] <p00f> p00f: i was hoping... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/1e3df5cfb9fe581e40f0f40f7b2c7727bd8699dd)

[19:26:28] <p00f> are there examples?
[19:26:39] <saltrocklamp[m]> maybe? i'm not sure. i see that a lot of the more popular schemes have special case highlighting for popular languages
[19:27:06] <numToStr[m]> Yes, you can do that
[19:27:31] <saltrocklamp[m]> e.g. OceanicNext has a bunch of special cases for ruby, python, et al
[19:27:34] <numToStr[m]> Prefix the hi group with language
[19:27:36] <saltrocklamp[m]> and that's just the one i happen to have open right now

[19:29:25] <clason[m]> they might not be reported by playground, but they're there and can be mapped
[19:29:38] <p00f> clason[m]: i mean you don't have `rustTSTypeDef` and `rustTSTypeUse`

[19:30:19] <clason[m]> but there are much more specialized captures that you can map highlights to
[19:30:44] <clason[m]> like (fictitious) `TSType.definition`
[19:31:32] <p00f> clason[m]: i don't think there is, because normal `TSTypeDef` and `TSTypeUse` without rust aren't
[19:31:46] <p00f> clason[m]: fictitious being the key word
[19:31:50] <clason[m]> yes
[19:32:12] <saltrocklamp[m]> that's what we were discussing clason: contributing support for the currently-hypothetical `TSType.definition` to nvim-treeesitter. it would be a small change and people could contribute support gradually over time
[19:32:21] <saltrocklamp[m]> or at least that's where the conversation led
[19:32:28] <clason[m]> I'm just saying that nvim-treesitter offers much more customizability than the "standard" (even `TSfoo`) highlight groups
[19:32:28] <p00f> yeah
[19:32:40] <clason[m]> which ones depends on the queries
[19:33:11] <clason[m]> I'm saying look at the query first what is actually captured
[19:33:15] <saltrocklamp[m]> there's no reason you couldn't start supporting `TSType.definition` right now in your custom color scheme, but then you might run into trouble if one day it gets accepted in nvim-treesitter with slightly different semantics
[19:33:46] <p00f> so
[19:33:46] <p00f> 1) there currently aren't any colorschemes which have their own queries

[22:19:59] <smolck> `local stuff = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)`, then `stuff[1]` is a 1-based index and `stuff[2]` is a 0-based index, now go figure that out
[22:20:05] <dundargoc> I'M NOT ANGRY!
[22:20:25] <smolck> that's his secret, he's always angry
[22:20:35] <smolck> ii14[m]: you named the chat that should not be named

[22:24:03] <smolck> no
[22:24:11] <smolck> that's enough to drive a man mad
[22:24:14] <ii14[m]> you can have cursors at different places
[22:24:17] <ii14[m]> in different windows
[22:24:23] <smolck> but in the same buffer
[22:24:26] <ii14[m]> even tho its the same buffer
[22:24:37] <ii14[m]> do a split with :vs
[22:24:40] <smolck> `:e some_file` and `:vs` and boom
[22:24:40] <ii14[m]> and move the cursor
[22:25:19] <dundargoc> OK that makes sens.e

[22:25:47] <smolck> hey
[22:26:10] <dundargoc> smolck: thanks for the help.
[22:26:11] <smolck> thank me too even though I basically just echoed what ii14 said
[22:26:37] <ii14[m]> and I echoed what b_F_r_E_d_L said
[22:26:44] <ii14[m]> nim naming convention
[22:27:24] <dundargoc> Next sentence.
[22:27:30] <dundargoc> > The 'cursor position in the window' should be the actual position in the window grid, not the byte index from the buffer. This will obviously deviate when multi-byte characters are encountered.
[22:27:49] <ii14[m]> multibyte characters
[22:28:04] <ii14[m]> multiple bytes can be in one cell

[22:28:11] <ii14[m]> like emojis
[22:28:11] <smolck> I think that means it's like, the row,col but each cell could be multiple byte chars

[22:34:47] <megalithicSethMe> any of you using tailwindcss been able to get highlighted rendering of the documentColor entries in nvim-cmp? in other words, when viewing the documentation for a color in the completion menu, are you able to get the color highlighted as the actual color described?

[22:45:59] <natechan> It looks like (in NVIM v0.6.0) setting <<iminsert=1>> results in the completion menu presented by tab during a call to input() appear in the wrong location.  This smol vimrc https://pastebin.com/YZQuVprg illustrates the problem.  How might this be worked around?
