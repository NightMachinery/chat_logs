[04:02:55] <OnlineCop> My thoughts on the emojis problem: Whatever those emojis print (let's say it's ٩ʕ•͡×•ʔ۶) requires 6x octals in PS1. That means that your prompt tries to backtrack 6 "characters" whenever you start backspacing/up-arrowing, etc. However, the emojis themselves might only be "one" character to the non-terminal, so instead of it backing up 6, it should really only back up 1 (or 2).
[04:03:33] <OnlineCop> So you might be able to get around the problem by \[...\] escaping those 6 octals. But, since it thinks they are 2 "characters" wide, you need to add back in 2 "characters.
[04:03:45] <OnlineCop> That's where those un-\[ ... \]-escaped \e[0m's come in.
[04:04:55] <OnlineCop> They are each 1 byte, so now, you have \[\357\214\203  \356\234\222\] to have PS1 "stop" counting them, but then adding a couple \e[0m back in somewhere (not within \[...\]).
[04:05:03] <OnlineCop> Just my 2 cents on it.

[14:39:49] <geirha> hard to follow that script. It parses a bunch of parted and lvs commands, so it requires knowing what those commands output in each case. But a general approach to debug it is to use set -x
[14:39:51] <geirha> !-x
[14:39:51] <greybot> set -x (or ''bash -x myscript'') makes bash output the exact command that it will run after parsing and expansion. You can put ''set -x'' just before the code you want to debug (turn off with ''set +x''). To add more information, change PS4 first: eg. PS4='+($?) $BASH_SOURCE:$FUNCNAME:$LINENO:'

[19:01:45] <Soliton> well, try just  echo "${!LESS_TERMCAP_@}"  to see what variable names it expands to.
[19:02:05] <OnlineCop> It's alright; I'm just trying to find a convenient way to @Q-print my `declare -p` output when they contain $'...' literals.
[19:02:14] <OnlineCop> That expands to nothing.
[19:02:18] <Soliton> i guess you don't have to leave out the quotes. if nothing matches it's like just calling declare -p.
[19:02:33] <OnlineCop> echo "'${!LESS_TERMCAP_@}'" just prints ''
[19:03:15] <Soliton> so if you don't know beforehand you need to check it actually expands to something before giving it to declare.

[21:15:50] <greycat> that's not equivalent to process substitution, though.  the command sub is run until it completes, and the results are stored in a temp file.
[21:16:09] <greycat> with process substitution, there's a pipe between two concurrent processes
[21:16:49] <greycat> the POSIX equivalent of process substitution is to create a FIFO, run a background process writing to it, and then run a foreground process reading from it.  then clean up.
[21:17:43] <phy1729> It's useful in the case where you need the RHS of a pipeline in the foreground which is what process substitution is used for sometimes. Absent wayttd info, I figure it's worth a mention

[22:13:39] <greycat> The issue is that your program has to be able to separate the larger string into the set of smaller strings.  If you use a space between the smaller strings, but there can be a space already INSIDE one of the smaller strings, you have a problem.

[23:02:06] <Filystyn> also thank you for other answers irc users.
[23:02:12] <OnlineCop> FreeBSD's sed -E apparently differs from GNU's sed -E/-r. Thanks, Apple.
[23:02:35] <phy1729> Guess one could  sed -E $'s/^(\U1F332|\U1F333|\U1F334|\U1F341|\U1F384|\U1F38B)*//'
[23:02:42] <twkm> you should pee towards gnu too.
[23:02:50] <xmb> everypee
[23:03:05] <OnlineCop> Couldn't those just go into a [character group] ?
[23:03:10] <phy1729> no
[23:03:22] <phy1729> because they're treated as bytes not characters

[23:03:32] <xmb> convert to LC C
[23:03:47] <xmb> and use the 2 / 3 or so length chars
[23:03:56] <Soliton> how do GNU and bsd sed -E differ?
[23:04:43] <greycat> sounds like a good question for #sed
[23:04:48] <phy1729> but that should solve Filystyn original problem
