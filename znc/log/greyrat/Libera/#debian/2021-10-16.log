[00:08:41] <redbrass> tomreyn: ovmf is handled via the qemu call.  I'm testing a "production" installer image - so hacking the startup.nsh isn't the first choice.  I do have a vbox_headless.nsh I switch to that works with our console output.  The default .nsh assumes a normal hardware setup where the output is redirected to a differnent tty after the boot sequence.  That results in no further output in the console.
[00:09:18] <redbrass> er.. no further output in the serial console....
[00:11:35] <Blondie101010> hmmmm, random thought...  couldn't you just have a different boot image served over TFTP based on the VLAN?

[00:13:41] <redbrass> PMT: yeah, putting expect in the initramfs might be handy.  I'd have to do some other changes to make that the init script.  But yeah, that may be the path I end up on.
[00:14:53] <redbrass> basically, our build process creates a bootable USB image file.  Now we need to validate that that image works properly, at least to the point where specialized QA can be done (i.e. does that image launch to a point where further hardware specific tests can be done...)
[00:16:02] <redbrass> That specialized QA takes place after the installer has installed our stuff to the virtual hard disk. (virtual for testing purposes that is..)
[00:17:10] <redbrass> I need to script the test that ensures the installer works as expected (so we can extend our CI/CD processes..)

[17:35:27] <Wyzard> willow, libvirt-daemon-system depends on dnsmasq-base (which contains the actual dnsmasq program), but it does not depend on dnsmasq (which provides the systemd unit to run dnsmasq as a system service)

[17:37:29] <Wyzard> I think the reason for the dependency is so that libvirt can run "private" dnsmasq instances providing NAT for VMs, which I'd expect to be independent of whatever DNS service the system provides to the outside network
[17:38:36] <Blondie101010> oh you're right :)
[17:38:54] <Blondie101010> my guess would therefore lean more towards the DHCP aspect
[17:39:15] <Wyzard> I'd expect those dnsmasq processes to listen only on the tun/tap interfaces that connect the host to the VMs, so they shouldn't interfere with powerdns or whatever listening on your external network interface

[18:18:05] <willow> excited to try powerdns with sqlite3 backend.  it seems like a db backend would make managing zones a lot easier.
[18:19:25] <willow> i've written scripts to do complex regex operations to do things like update dkim keys in zone files.  not fun.  it seems logical that all the components of a zone file should be fields in a table.
[18:19:52] *** Parts: RNeese (~rneese@2600:6c5c:6a00:c4e3:9c67:fcd7:bbd3:c91a) ()
[18:20:37] <willow> sqlite3 seems like a good choice since it's not dependent on an actual sql server daemon to be running
[18:25:46] <jim> the thing with sqlite is, you can have only one connection to it... so either it's the dns server or it's maybe a client set up to alter its records
[18:26:41] <jim> which also means, you would have to take down the dns server in order to make changes to the dns records
[18:27:06] <willow> good to keep in mind 👍
[18:27:38] <Wyzard> I think sqlite does allow multiple processes to open and use the db file
[18:28:27] <Wyzard> Writes lock the whole database (not just the record being updated), so it's not efficient to share a db between lots of writers, but it's still safe
[18:29:12] <Wyzard> and that shouldn't be a problem for a DNS server since you're probably not changing records frequently

[18:32:11] *** Quits: Sokomine (~Sokomine@user/sokomine) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[18:33:00] <jim> and, the dns server probably does not write to the db
[18:33:42] <jim> unless the lookup cache is in the db
[18:34:39] <Wyzard> Even if it does, that's not a problem since 99.99% of the time it's the only thing using the db anyway

[18:37:14] <Wyzard> but it should be safe for an update client to change things while the server is using the database; the update client might have to wait a moment if the server is writing to the database, and then the server might have to wait briefly while the update client writes its changes, but the concurrent access shouldn't hurt anything other than DNS responses maybe being delayed a few milliseconds due to the locking

[18:48:46] <jim> can the dns server you're using, use other dbms systems?

[21:53:20] <nunggu> respectfully, i think it's perfectly ok to use pc with debian as router since long-long ago there was a debian derivative called vyatta that specialize on being a router. PC is general purpose hardware. Debian have great, welcoming, and helpful community that can be bothered to help with how to make a router using debian. Debian will get security update and upgraded forever. Consumer class router
[21:53:22] <nunggu> on the other hand...., while the OS may get updated (like Mikrotik RouterOS), the small available storage will make it obsolete far more earlier than a PC.

[22:18:07] <Wyzard> Consider using an OS like OPNsense that's designed for routers, though; that'll be easier to configure
[22:18:29] <jkc> Blondie101010: I'm sorry, but I strongly disagree with what you're saying. Most consumer routers are horrendously underpowered. The heaviest lifting for most routers is crypto, and any consumer CPU made in the last... several years at least... has hardware acceleration for that.

[22:19:18] <jkc> Blondie101010: Unless you're buying high-end hardware that has dedicated ASICs for switching or something of that sort, all you're running is some small ARM CPU that is going to get absolutely destroyed by even moderate consumer CPUs.
[22:19:39] *** Joins: AndrewYu (~andrew@user/andrewyu)
[22:20:21] <jkc> There is nothing wrong with using a spare PC for a home router/firewall and, if configured properly, can offer some impressive functionality. Try running suricata on a $50 home router.
[22:20:22] <Blondie101010> not bad points, but why is your router loaded with any kind of crypto?  VPN?
[22:20:34] <Wyzard> My own router is running on a PC Engines APU2, which is about the size of a small ethernet switch but it's actually an amd64 PC (and it can run Debian or OPNsense)
[22:20:37] <nunggu> VPN or IPSecs?
[22:20:38] <jkc> Blondie101010: VPN, TLS inspection if you really want to, etc.
[22:20:47] *** Quits: fcinq (~irc@network.g33k.host) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[22:20:52] <Blondie101010> APU is/was a neat device
[22:21:20] <jkc> Wyzard: I've got a tiny low-power i7 box. Six NICs. The thing SCREAMS. I have symmetric gigabit over fiber with full TLS inspection and suricata.
[22:21:20] *** Parts: tieinv (~tieinv@user/tieinv) (Leaving)
[22:21:47] <jkc> Something that you wouldn't have a hope of supporting with a consumer router.
[22:22:32] <Blondie101010> my main point was money, and so far your arguments are not
[22:22:41] <jkc> Plus you're not reliant on vendors for firmware updates, which are notoriously bad.
[22:22:50] <Blondie101010> but you do have valid points
[22:22:57] <jkc> Blondie101010: 14:10 <Blondie101010> many reasons including: relying on a desktop system to replace a reliable device, as well as performance limitations that are typically overcome by hardware acceleration on many affordable specialized devices
[22:23:15] <Blondie101010> yes
[22:23:17] <jkc> Blondie101010: If your main point was money, you'd have said it first.
[22:23:29] <Blondie101010> no but ok it's the second point then
[22:23:30] <nunggu> you guys have super cool PCs. when i imagine debian based PC router, usually it's because that PC is an old abandoned, decades-old PC and slap some NIC/USB wifi. i think it's because i'm in a third world country.
[22:23:54] <jkc> nunggu: What's your internet speed?
[22:24:26] <alkisg> Wouldn't the power needed to operate a pentium 3 as a router, be more expensive than e.g. buying an rpi-zero or something?
[22:24:47] <Wyzard> My first home router (in like 2001) was an old spare PC, something like a 90MHz Pentium, running Debian  :-)
[22:24:49] <jkc> alkisg: Depends on what you want it to do. An RPi could NOT handle my connection.
[22:25:11] <nunggu> 30Mbps down, 8Mbps up, around 30USD/month, and it's not unlimited, at some point the ISP will do throttling, perhaps after 500GB transfer
[22:25:24] <alkisg> Eh, mine is 250mbps :)
[22:25:28] <alkisg> up/down
[22:26:06] <jkc> Blondie101010: And your response is predicated on the concept that everyone needs to do what I do. I bought what I bought because of what I wanted it to do. For nunggu, for instance, a ten year old Core i3 would easily do the job.
[22:26:19] <nunggu> well, old unused PC is free and electricity is unreliable here yes, but power is cheap (read: dirty, from coal)
[22:26:51] <Blondie101010> jkc:  that's so unclear I'll just skip it
[22:26:52] <jkc> Hell, I used an Athlon X2 3400(?) as my firewall processor for years.
