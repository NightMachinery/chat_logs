[12:30:29] <rindolf> Rashad: hi
[12:31:43] <Rashad> rindolf I have a simple idea for a new kind of AI.... care to hear? 
[12:31:52] <Rashad> It can be done with JavaScript. 
[12:32:38] *** Quits: efex_ (~efex@S0106a84e3fbc9313.du.shawcable.net) (Quit: efex_)
[12:34:13] <macrobat> ai is for lisp, no?
[12:34:33] <Rashad> You can implement AI algorithms in any language, I think. 
[12:34:58] <Rashad> This one will be easier to do in JavaScript, because it has dynamic typing and also `eval`.
[12:36:40] <Rashad> The point is to make the AI write code into the program, where `eval` gets handy, but with C# or Java it can just output the code as a string and then compile this output outside the program. 
[12:37:58] *** Joins: OnAironaut (~OnAir@user/onaironaut)
[12:40:18] <macrobat> yes, this is territory where lisp excels. it has macros to "rewrite itself" so to speak. js is harder to handle
[12:40:53] <Rashad> Ah.
[12:40:57] <Rashad> Could be useful. 
[12:41:58] <macrobat> grammar for js is much more complicated than lisp grammar

[23:49:37] <artao> It is not my trumpet that is flat, it is my lips.
[23:55:00] <artao> WHOA
[23:55:11] <artao> I just switched from my 14a4a mouthpiece to my 13a
[23:55:17] <artao> much easier to play!!
[23:55:20] <artao> i should buy a 7c
[23:55:27] <artao> IDK what happened to my 7c
[23:55:50] <artao> buty mouthpieces are like 50usd +
[23:59:11] <artao> i'm actually able to hit high A with the 13c ... with the 14a4a i could barely hit high G
[23:59:30] <artao> i even hit high B momentarily, unwarmed up even
[23:59:56] <artao> Moral: 14a4a is not for a weak embouchure
