[04:04:55] <Nanobot> I've been a good little boy all year, and all I ask is that Instacart go out of business so that somebody else can come in and fill their void.
[04:05:34] <Nanobot> Every time I use their site, I feel like the victim of domestic violence.
[04:06:48] <MootPoot> hello beaky
[04:06:53] <MootPoot> Nanobot: is it really that bad
[04:07:05] <MootPoot> although I've never used it so idk
[04:07:59] <Nanobot> Yes, and it gets worse every time I use it. It's like every day they wake up thinking, "What new types of unwanted bullshit can we start interrupting our users with today?"
[04:08:08] <Roey> oh hey beaky
[04:08:10] <Roey> and MootPoot & Nanobot 
[04:08:29] <Roey> Has there been any anime about casual use of hallucinagens?
[04:08:33] <MootPoot> oh, so its one of those kind of popups
[04:08:33] <Roey> in a not-bad way?
[04:08:35] <MootPoot> Roey: lmao no
[04:08:38] <Roey> ynot
[04:08:44] <MootPoot> japan is REALLY hard on drugs
[04:08:54] <Roey> k
[04:08:59] <MootPoot> you cant show anything that even slightly demonstrates them in a positive light
[04:09:04] <Roey> ohhhhhhhh I see
[04:09:17] <Nanobot> They literally punish me for adding an item to my cart. And they do it *randomly*. I add an item to my cart, and then I stop and wait to see if I'm going to be attacked by a modal popup that puts a clickable thing right where my cursor is.
[04:09:39] <MootPoot> for refernce, they are strict enough that just saying "I like / do weed" on twitter is enough to get the police at your door Roey 
[04:09:46] <Roey> ahhhh
[04:09:49] <Nanobot> And do you know how to add 2 of an item to your cart? You click add twice.
[04:09:51] <Roey> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
[04:10:03] <Roey> MootPoot: ^ thanks for the info
[04:10:24] <MootPoot> Nanobot: so unless japan does a 180 on that - not happening
[04:10:30] <Roey> heh ok
[04:10:55] <MootPoot> Nanobot:  can you designate the modal popup and just delete the element preemtively?
[04:11:17] <MootPoot> I use uBlock origin's block element feature to do that for me
[04:11:29] <Nanobot> They obfuscate everything in the HTML. They have ads that I can't block because the HTML is different every time.
[04:11:48] <MootPoot> even with a DNS blocker thingy?
[04:11:51] <MootPoot> damn
[04:11:58] <Nanobot> The site is also agonizingly slow because all the JS framework bullshit.
[04:12:15] <MootPoot> you're making me never want to use it , and I've never used instacart
[04:12:17] <Nanobot> It's their domain, with URLs that look like normal URLs they use for other essential things.
[04:12:55] <MootPoot> well
[04:13:34] <MootPoot> I guess you have the cash - just get a rando to do it for you
[04:13:57] <MootPoot> I know some people who have cleaning maids which are just part timers/ uni students
[04:14:13] <MootPoot> they just pay them an extra 100-200 a month to pick up groceries for them as well
[04:15:08] <MootPoot> sure some rando uni student could use it more then like
[04:15:13] <MootPoot> instacart

[05:51:07] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle:  noods u say

[05:51:43] <mixfix41> well im just using ip route to route local media server
[05:52:17] <ButterNoodle> why route if its local
[05:52:30] <MootPoot> route local moms to ur area
[05:52:34] <MootPoot> ofc
[05:53:09] <ButterNoodle> I prefer policy based routing.. if match on hot moms then route to next hop
[05:53:48] <mixfix41> because i gotta learn it. im purposely skipping any hubs or switches and doing it with pcs and laptops with direct connections. its a large loss in speed but the eeducation is vital
[05:53:49] <ButterNoodle> if match on ugly fat moms then increase local preference
[05:54:12] <ButterNoodle> mixfix41: tf
[05:54:34] <ButterNoodle> u just adding nics and different ip networks and hoping for the best
[05:55:11] <mixfix41> well dhcpcd was covering everything until i start to add mroe machines (my media server) before that it was just my local services not media
[05:55:25] <mixfix41> so i had to dig a command and it was solve quick..
[05:55:29] <mixfix41> its more practicing
[05:55:34] <mixfix41> thats all
[05:55:36] <ButterNoodle> sounds like u could just download more switch ports
[05:55:43] <mixfix41> dont need to
[05:55:45] <mixfix41> its too fast..
[05:55:52] <ButterNoodle> I dont get it
[05:56:40] <mixfix41> no you arent suppose to , the setup imo is more versatile. i dont have to plug a switch in thats an extra power cord, more work, but less powercords
[05:57:08] <ButterNoodle> no it just defies all logic

[06:51:56] <MootPoot> sometimes you need to be reeled back in

[06:52:33] <BillyZane> i use to dread mondays
[06:52:39] <BillyZane> now i don't even know what day of the week it is
[06:52:59] <BillyZane> i got a job as a dish washer
[06:53:18] <mixfix41> i use to do that
[06:53:19] <BillyZane> i was a waiter as well
[06:53:41] <BillyZane> my hand was peeling skin cause of those damn frying pans
[06:53:59] <BillyZane> they all had rough metal bars for handles, i would grip it open hand
[06:54:16] <mixfix41> we had ecolab chemicals to use with industrial hobart dish washer
[06:54:29] <BillyZane> nice
[06:54:47] <mixfix41> i left that job to get license in real estate
[06:55:12] <BillyZane> that's a good skill to have
[06:55:16] <BillyZane> are you doing real estate then?
[06:55:27] <mixfix41> no that was over ten years ago
[06:55:32] <BillyZane> oh i see
[06:55:56] <mixfix41> a lot of foreclosures during that time
[06:56:04] <BillyZane> oh i see, was this before or after 2008?

[06:56:20] <mixfix41> so marketing buyers during the aftermath
[06:56:40] <BillyZane> that would have been a nice time to buy a house

[07:04:38] <ButterNoodle> yea
[07:04:39] <mixfix41> hey my parents have done pretty well financially. its just everything else they let go to shit

[07:05:23] <ButterNoodle> BillyZane: yea It's been pretty stagnant since pandemic
[07:05:31] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: thats how it works
[07:05:47] <ButterNoodle> when I was hunting it was like that
[07:05:55] <ButterNoodle> but chances are the 3 in one week are all shit
[07:06:15] <MootPoot> well, right now lets see
[07:06:18] <ButterNoodle> I fortunately found some contract work while I was unemployed
[07:06:42] <MootPoot> I have 1 recruiter lead , one direct interview request and one ( come talk to us in 5 months )
[07:07:12] <ButterNoodle> unfortunately most people that I was trying to get a job w I had turned down jobs when I was employed because they were cheap
[07:07:39] <ButterNoodle> then they like.. naaa we to cheap then, why we ok now?
[07:07:42] <MootPoot> I feel like the big secret is keeping your fixed costs as low as you realistically can
[07:07:55] <ButterNoodle> all costs as low as possible
[07:08:23] <MootPoot> if you own your own house and have no loans - you can get by on basically nothing
[07:08:24] <ButterNoodle> I just paid off ~1400 a month in bills over christmas
[07:08:40] <ButterNoodle> yea my house is paid off relatively soon
[07:08:53] <ButterNoodle> I'll not be living here then hopefully
[07:09:23] <MootPoot> still planning on cutting and running?
[07:09:29] <ButterNoodle> if the housing market doesnt shit the bed before I move to TX I'll probably just buy a townhome till it does

[08:53:23] <JesseDesu> mostly cuz google doesnt respond well
[08:53:31] <MootPoot> try a different dns server?
[08:53:38] <JesseDesu> same thing
[08:53:43] <JesseDesu> all of the servers
[08:53:46] <MootPoot> well, if you are linking to a different country then its gonna be shit
[08:53:49] <JesseDesu> say unusual traffic detected
[08:53:50] <MootPoot> no matter what
[08:54:00] <MootPoot> but DNS server is differnet from VPN server
[08:54:11] <MootPoot> are you using cloudflare?
[08:54:14] <MootPoot> no-IP?
[08:54:20] <JesseDesu> what 
[08:54:21] <MootPoot> google DNS?
[08:54:22] <JesseDesu> is that
[08:54:26] <JesseDesu> 8.8.8.8?
[08:54:30] <MootPoot> yea
[08:54:32] <MootPoot> that stuff
[08:54:33] <JesseDesu> i dunno
[08:54:42] <JesseDesu> i just press connect

[08:54:46] <JesseDesu> select a region
[08:54:58] <MootPoot> yeah that's not a DNS , thats your VPN
[08:55:12] <MootPoot> although I think depending on your VPN they might be making it use their DNS as well
[08:55:12] <JesseDesu> is the DNS configurable through the VPN software
[08:55:36] <MootPoot> DNS is usually through your router or through your computer that you want the DNS changed on

[09:09:32] <JesseDesu> the penguin?
[09:09:34] <JesseDesu> from batman
[09:09:40] <ButterNoodle> and I'd only torrent over vpn anyway
[09:09:46] <ButterNoodle> not from the house
[09:10:10] <JesseDesu> butternoodle, i'd like to try your elaborate setup
[09:10:11] <ButterNoodle> I seed from canada
[09:10:27] <JesseDesu> arch and all
[09:10:30] <ButterNoodle> yea it works like everything else
[09:10:40] <ButterNoodle> its like getting in a ford truck
[09:10:42] <JesseDesu> i use the simplest tools available
[09:10:46] <MootPoot> is canada real
[09:10:59] <ButterNoodle> except when u sit in it.. all the controls are slightly different
[09:10:59] <MootPoot> or am a AI just living in ButterNoodles server
[09:11:14] <ButterNoodle> and nothing inside is from the factory
[09:11:29] <MootPoot> emmeka told me to never get ford
[09:11:33] <ButterNoodle> *browses the google just fine tho
[09:11:38] <ButterNoodle> why
[09:11:42] <ButterNoodle> they run forever
[09:11:48] <ButterNoodle> short of a honda or toyota
[09:11:50] <JesseDesu> my dad had a ford escort in the 80s
[09:11:53] <JesseDesu> worst car
[09:11:56] <ButterNoodle> #metoo JesseDesu 
[09:12:03] <MootPoot> oh wait
[09:12:04] <MootPoot> nvm
[09:12:08] <ButterNoodle> mine ran for 400,000 miles
[09:12:10] <MootPoot> he said never get a GM
[09:12:11] <JesseDesu> we went toyota in 1993 and never looked back
[09:12:14] <ButterNoodle> then I sold it
[09:12:25] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: that makes sense
[09:12:32] <MootPoot> I dont think I'd get a ford 
[09:12:41] <ButterNoodle> they are overpriced and cheap.. they feel like a toyota inside
[09:12:48] <MootPoot> like - the most I would consider is a compact truck
[09:12:51] <JesseDesu> my family has owned like 7 camrys
[09:12:58] <ButterNoodle> *i'd never own toyota or gm
[09:12:58] <MootPoot> and the problem with that is there are basically just 3 of them int he market
[09:13:12] <MootPoot> chevy colarado  , honda ridgeline and that new korean one
[09:13:14] <JesseDesu> butternoodle
[09:13:15] <ButterNoodle> ford or honda
[09:13:16] <MootPoot> forget the name
[09:13:24] <JesseDesu> toyota is the best
[09:13:26] <MootPoot> colarado looks nice though
[09:13:28] <ButterNoodle> ford ranger is back MootPoot.. but its overpriced as shit
[09:13:28] <MootPoot> good aftermarket
[09:13:31] <JesseDesu> my dad swears by it
[09:13:39] <ButterNoodle> yea
[09:13:43] <MootPoot> how much we talking 
[09:13:45] <JesseDesu> its a dad car
[09:13:49] <ButterNoodle> toyota lasts forever.. but they are cheap inside
[09:13:58] <JesseDesu> thats what you want
[09:14:04] <ButterNoodle> not really
[09:14:10] <JesseDesu> its not a luxury vehicle
[09:14:36] <mixfix41> if you want high mileage per tank get a nissan maxima(sp?) i think thats the model
[09:14:40] <mixfix41> it gets like 500 per tank
[09:14:42] <ButterNoodle> if I wanted the trim to fall apart and stuff to stop working at 50,000 miles I'd buy a GM.. not a toyota thats overpriced
[09:15:00] <ButterNoodle> nissan.. always overlooked, and a good ride
[09:15:12] <MootPoot> boring tho
[09:15:16] <JesseDesu> toyota engines are 400,000 milers
[09:15:22] <MootPoot> they had that huge scandal recently
[09:15:24] <MootPoot> with their PM

[17:21:25] <darkwitch> it's important to help make the chinese rolex clone industry survive in these difficult times
[17:22:21] <Terminus> also, i'm fascinated by automatics. quartz are a dime a dozen. if i want accurate time, i just look at my computer.
[17:22:25] <Sadale> Terminus, ah. mentality of older people :P
[17:22:52] <Sadale> I'm actually developing an internet synchronized clock. Not a watch tho.
[17:23:24] <Terminus> i'm liking the idea of buying a bunch of cheap movements and learning watchmaking.
[17:23:57] <Sadale> making watch sounds very difficult. It's fascinating to me as well.
[17:24:22] <Sadale> It's like magic with all those gears spinning around and somehow it could turn the clock
[17:24:54] <Terminus> looks like i can start with less than $100. $40 for the movement, $30 for tools, remaining $30 for whatever i haven't thought of.
[17:25:29] <Sadale> wow. That inexpensive?
[17:26:00] <Terminus> yep. the $40 for the movement is actually 2x crap movements. but for learning purposes, don't need the quality $200 ones.

[17:27:27] <Terminus> Sadale: should be definitely easy for you to get. all the stuff i'm looking at is from china.
[17:27:28] <Sadale> Makes me wonder if you could use the same knowledge to make vibrators
[17:28:07] <Sadale> I'd just need to amplify the vibration of the movable parts inside the watch somehow :3
[17:28:08] <Terminus> aren't vibrators easy? just put an imbalanced weight at the end of a motor.
[17:28:21] <Sadale> true. There're even dedicated vibration motors
[17:28:26] <Terminus> but sure, you can gear it so you achieve some other effect.
[17:29:06] <Sadale> Terminus, Now, go make a vibrator for beerbear! :P
[17:29:15] <Sadale> Is that beerbear or bearbeer? I couldn't remember
[17:29:28] <Terminus> Sadale: bearbeer. and i can just buy one instead. easier. =P
[17:29:52] <Sadale> nononono! This one's different! It's made by Terminus. Her boyfriend made it! :D
[17:30:22] <Sadale> To be fair tho the ones available in the market is probably of higher quality at cheaper pric
[17:30:24] <Sadale> price*
[17:30:30] <Terminus> also, i've explained the thought process to her about the reasoning behind buying replica watches. she agrees that it's silly to buy genuine. ü§£
[17:31:08] <Sadale> lol
[17:31:32] <Sadale> I honestly think that it's silly to buy a branded watch. Money could have been spent on something better. :P
[17:31:35] <Terminus> i like a particular watch for her. the clone is $600. the genuine is $60k. spending $60k on a watch is silly. that's like 60 m^2 of land already.
[17:31:38] <Sadale> like onaholes!
[17:32:02] <Sadale> yeah $600 could get you like 10 onaholes.

[17:45:30] <Sadale> Just so you know, she's cute. And I believe that she won't get married away any time soon. Basically both of us just don't bother getting into a relationship with any external people.
[17:46:23] <Terminus> Urchin[emacs]: they just seem to be better quality than the others i've seen. i could always just frankenstein my own watch if i really go crazy.
[17:46:28] <Sadale> What I'm thinking is that, why even bother getting a gf while I've got a cute, supportive imouto? And what she's worried about is that she may end up geetting into a toxic relationship.
[17:47:13] <Terminus> Sadale: so what you're saying is getting married to your imouto is the best option. üòõ
[17:47:47] <Sadale> Terminus, only if that's possible. In almost everywhere on the earth it isn't possible to formally marry an imouto. :'(
[17:48:43] <Sadale> Terminus, we do often joke about marriage tho. Just for lulz xD
[17:49:35] <Terminus> Sadale: there's always the option of acting married because screw social conventions. üòÇ
[17:49:48] <Urchin[emacs]> Terminus: btw, what did you get?
[17:50:32] <Sadale> Terminus, true. In fact if she ends up being with me in long run, and if I ever move out of my parent's home, it may even be more convenient to pretend that me and her are couples in the public.
[17:51:13] <Terminus> Urchin[emacs]: yachtmaster 116622. silver dial.
[17:51:18] <Sadale> Terminus, It'd be weird to see an imouto living with an onii-chan in the same home. Like very weird. People may get the wrong idea. :/
[17:52:51] <Terminus> Urchin[emacs]: 2824 movement because i'm thinking it's easier to maintain than a 3135. can buy a sellita SW200 for $200 if it ever comes to that.

[17:53:36] <Terminus> meanwhile, vostok doesn't even say what movement is in their watches on their website.
[17:54:01] <Sadale> wtf a movement even is?
[17:54:17] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: mechanism
[17:54:26] <Terminus> Urchin[emacs]: they're ok i think. yachtmaster 2 on the other hand, now that's ugly.
[17:54:44] <Urchin[emacs]> Terminus: Vostok uses their own movement, they have few configurations
[17:55:19] <Terminus> but if it was me, a yachtmaster isn't what i'd buy either.
[17:55:42] <Terminus> Urchin[emacs]: i want specs and service manuals though. haven't seen any for vostok.
[17:55:48] <Sadale> Terminus, Do you need a clock in your home? That's because I happen to be making one. xD
[17:56:00] <Terminus> i prefer watches based on ETA movements.
[17:56:01] <Urchin[emacs]> Terminus: also, they're probably closest to the architecture of Rolex movements among cheap movements (in terms of automatic module and the date flip mechanism in particular, though they lack quickset)
[17:56:17] <Sadale> It'll probably take me weeks to complete this project to the state that I can ship it tho
[17:58:14] <Terminus> Urchin[emacs]: at that point though, i'd probably lean towards a high quality clone 3135 movement instead. i believe there's also a clone 4130.

[18:00:09] <Urchin[emacs]> Terminus: a whole Vostok is $40-ish last time I checked
[18:00:54] <Urchin[emacs]> Terminus: they have some weird '60s solutions as far as their dive watches go, but '60s are well before everybody had what's now agreed upon to be good qualities of a dive watch
[18:01:59] <Terminus> Urchin[emacs]: i'd have to check landed cost. the a seiko is easier for me to get.
[18:02:35] <Terminus> so far, i haven't found a local vostok dealer.
[18:03:14] <Terminus> also doesn't help that the vostok website is so slow. probably because they don't use a CDN.
[18:03:29] <Urchin[emacs]> Terminus: you order Vostok online
[18:03:47] <Urchin[emacs]> Terminus: there's Meranom as the primary online shop for them

[23:46:10] <Bco1981> 3600x vs 4790k... why bother

[23:47:05] <MootPoot> idk
[23:47:16] <MootPoot> cpu mark is over 2x in favor of the 3600x
[23:47:22] <Bco1981> single core barely matches the 4790k
[23:47:28] <Bco1981> that's multicore
[23:47:43] <Bco1981> games don't rely much on multicore. yet.
[23:47:49] <Berlin36> yo Bco1981 
[23:47:52] <Bco1981> yo Berlin36 
[23:47:56] <Berlin36> how are you
[23:48:27] <MootPoot> do you play on 1080p 240hz or something?
[23:48:39] <Bco1981> i'm fine, am alone this week. had a bit of a close call last week when my daughters teacher was tested positive.
[23:49:03] <Bco1981> MootPoot: just 144hz but i would like hit to be able to hit that.
[23:49:23] <Bco1981> *like it to be able to hit that.
[23:51:42] <Berlin36> i've played a bit of "Remnant From the ashes" today
[23:51:53] <Berlin36> it's like dark souls afaik, but with guns and shit
[23:52:51] <MootPoot> I think I've played it
[23:52:54] <Berlin36> a really nice game, was free on Epic Games about a month ago
[23:53:11] <Berlin36> its really the type of game i like
[23:53:41] <Bco1981> MootPoot: with a 3900x + rtx3080 vs 5600x + rtx 3080 there is atleast 20% more performance, half the cores.
[23:54:02] <S_T_A_N> I think this coffee was a mistake https://puu.sh/IEVHV/5ad1c2b159.jpg
[23:54:04] <ImoutoBot> [image/jpeg] 1.9MB
[23:54:15] <Bco1981> just because the IPC and single core performance is that much better.
[23:54:34] <Berlin36> why? S_T_A_N 
[23:55:04] <Bco1981> MootPoot: so my livingroom vr pc with the 3080, is not performing at it's best...
[23:55:21] <S_T_A_N> Rich, syrupy, salty is a hard flavor to dial in
[23:55:32] <Berlin36> oh
[23:57:00] <Berlin36> i also played "The Forest" a couple of days ago
[23:57:08] <Berlin36> almost finished it
[23:57:33] <Berlin36> got a bit into gaming since our lessons are online and shorter...
