[19:28:48] <Tookie> not sure where to start
[19:29:06] <rob0> read each one and follow the instructions it gives you?
[19:29:30] <rob0> also, always useful to start with your high-level goal
[19:29:46] <Tookie> just trying to get my netgear router to work with vpn
[19:30:34] <rob0> to do what in particular?
[19:30:46] <Tookie> to access my home network
[19:31:13] <rob0> and the router is running a server instance?
[19:31:24] <Tookie> seems like the auto config file it generated is not to current specifications for openvpn
[19:31:33] <rob0> not surprising
[19:31:37] <Tookie> yes
[19:33:04] <rob0> BTW using anything in 192.168.0.0/23 (0.x and 1.x) is a very bad idea.  You'll be on a hotspot somewhere using the same network.
[19:34:57] <Tookie> sent you the config file... it did not specify the specific ip 192.168.0.0 in it
[19:38:39] <rob0> sent me?
[19:39:03] <Tookie> pvt msg
[19:40:53] <rob0> Oh.  That is frowned upon.  And in any case, you should probably start at the HOWTO found at community.openvpn.net, and set it up yourself, correctly.
[19:41:46] <rob0> It will cover the various use cases.  Split tunnel (like just to access your home network) is relatively simple.
[19:42:34] <rob0> But you'll need to avoid potential IP address conflicts.
[19:46:29] <Tookie> theres nothing to "configure" on the router
[19:47:20] <rob0> sucks.  Maybe set up a server behind the router, and point to it with NAT?
[19:47:50] <rob0> Very few routers I have seen are any good in their openvpn implementations.

[22:28:10] <BtbN> I wish there were more end-user compatible routers you could just plopp down and forget about for years...
[22:28:32] <BtbN> Only ones I know about are the AVM ones, and those virtually don't exist outside of Germany.
[22:28:49] <BtbN> And OpenWRT is not useful for that, since it needs a lot of expert knowledge and manual maintenance

[22:43:36] <Tuvix> using openwrt stock is fairly turnkey but it depends what you do beyond builtin tasks
[22:44:28] <Tuvix> the openvpn package is not part of the default install but the graphical and even default config style it has is pretty bad
[22:45:16] <Tuvix> it gets better if you just use normal config files like you would on a linux host but this gets into needing some basic admin skills - most openvpn setups do frankly
[23:14:31] <ordex> Tuvix: I think it is close to impossible to create a gui that allows to configure openvpn in all its options
[23:15:28] <Tuvix> right. best case would be a gui that just exposes a text box with the config but that is probably not what most webdevs think looks good
[23:31:43] <ordex> hehe
[23:47:32] <BtbN> Tuvix, it's turnkey until the next security vulnerability turn up
[23:47:57] <BtbN> Cause the average end user will never apply the update to fix it, and there is no Auto-Update for what I'm aware
[23:49:21] <Tuvix> lots of off the shelf soho routers have no auto udpate either. perhaps its more common in lower end stuff now but since I don't run those myself..
[23:49:52] <Tuvix> most home users likely do not bother to check belkin or dlink or netgear or whatever site for new firmware images
[23:50:20] <BtbN> I'm literally only aware of AVM routers having rock solid auto update
[23:50:37] <Tuvix> point being that if you are trying to configure openvpn you are probably more on the ball than a vast majority of less technical users
[23:50:46] <BtbN> I have shipped a bunch of them around the world to friends for that reason, so they can just plopp it down and leave it there for 5 years, without ever being behind on security updates
[23:50:49] <Tuvix> though that still may not mean you bother to update your system..
[23:51:40] <BtbN> It's sickening how many TPlink/Linksys/Netgear/... shitbox router are around the world, vulnerable to years old attacks, because the owner has no idea what a firmware update even is
[23:54:19] <Tuvix> don't worry. they are secure, Because Of Nat </sarcasm>
