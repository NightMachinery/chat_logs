[19:20:15] <evilgohan2> It's an OLED so there is no backlight. Either the display is on or its not.
[19:21:04] <evilgohan2> I tried it again this morning. No luck. It just sat there like it was on, turned on the AVR too via CEC. But it did nothing. Then it turned itself off after about 10 minutes (and the AVR with it). that happened twice.
