[00:00:31] <beastDivision> i found the error, the wiki.znc.in/Reverse_Proxy page says for https to use: proxy_pass http://[::1]:7001$uri;
[00:00:46] <beastDivision> but that is wrong, the $uri should not be there
[00:01:07] <MetaNova> oh really
[00:01:11] <beastDivision> change it to proxy_pass http://[::1]:7001/; and it works fine 
[00:02:10] <MetaNova> maybe that's because uri isn't defined
[00:02:46] <MetaNova> beastDivision: what if you include "uri /" under "error_log" ?
[00:03:54] <MetaNova> simply replacing "$uri" with "/" won't always work as, yes, while / is the default uri if a custom uri is specified, "proxy_pass http://[::1]:7001/;" will not work
[00:05:04] <MetaNova> or maybe the "$uri" is intended to indicate that you should specify what your *actual* URI is
[00:05:46] <MetaNova> I'm just trying to determine how best to edit the wiki

[00:09:22] <DarthGandalf> beastDivision: for IRC or for HTTP?
[00:11:16] <beastDivision> DarthGandalf: for HTTP
[00:11:35] <beastDivision> I don't see anything about the uri in the error logs
[00:11:52] <beastDivision> I don't know how to best edit the wiki, I'm not an nginx expert
[00:16:43] <Nacorid> In nginx docs I only find $uri for try_files and error_page, although it supposedly always holds the current uri
[00:17:59] <MetaNova> the example location / {} blocks for https://wiki.znc.in/Reverse_Proxy#HTTP and https://wiki.znc.in/Reverse_Proxy#HTTPS differ
[00:18:07] <MetaNova> the HTTPS one includes $uri
[00:18:12] <MetaNova> the HTTP one does not
[00:18:13] <Nacorid> Yeah
[00:19:15] <Nacorid> Hmm
[00:19:28] <Nacorid> I just changed / to $uri and it still works
[00:20:00] <MetaNova> huh
[00:23:56] <MetaNova> I feel like the wiki needs editing I'm just not certain how best to edit it
[00:24:10] <MetaNova> this is the first time the $uri thing has been reported, to my memory
[00:25:11] <beastDivision> hmm, I'm using nginx/1.21.4 and znc 1.8.2, both install from official repo, nothing else installed besides certbot, I don't think I did anything wrong, but maybe I did, if no one else is reporting it maybe it isnt an issue 
[00:26:18] <MetaNova> as a compromise, I will include a mention of $uri needing to be removed in your case for it to work

[01:55:55] <rockworld> [17:25] <*status> Cannot connect to IRC (Invalid argument). Retrying...
[01:59:52] <rockworld> ok I finally got it lol all I had to do was /setbindhost 0.0.0.0
[02:02:48] <Khaytsus> rockworld: What was it set to?  You didn't have it to some silly host that doens't exist did you?
[02:03:35] <rockworld> no it was a domain that I pointed to the machine
[02:03:58] <rockworld> it should work too I dont know why it didnt 
[02:04:12] <Khaytsus> But did it resolve back...  the IP it resolves to must exist on the machine or it's literally listening to something that's invalid.
[02:04:35] <rockworld> yes it exist
[02:04:56] <rockworld> if you do dig tech.quebechosting.net it should point to 149.56.74.121
[02:05:11] <rockworld> or even /dns tech.quebechosting.net
[02:05:16] <Khaytsus> On the machine itself, it also resolves to that?  and that IP is directly assigned to that machine?
[02:05:37] <rockworld> yes that ip is directly assigned to
[02:05:43] <rockworld> and that domain name to
[02:05:46] <Khaytsus> Strange then...
[02:06:10] <Khaytsus> It's when people think they can put l33t.h4x.4u or something silly in there and znc somehow report that....... is when I usually see this broken ;)
[02:06:23] <Khaytsus> But if it's valid it should just work
[02:06:47] <rockworld> kinda weird I probably did something wrong on that Im going to look forward on it 
[02:06:50] <Khaytsus> Although I will piont out that 149.56.74.121 doesn't resolve to that domain, so won't be particularly exciting if you do make it work ;)
[02:06:54] <Khaytsus> It'd just show the IP
[02:06:59] <rockworld> you are right
[02:07:06] <rockworld> thats why Im guessing right now ^^
[02:07:31] <Khaytsus> Either way that should have worked, but... just pointing out that your hostname would be the IP in this case, if it worked, not the domain
[02:07:34] <rockworld> Im going to point the reverse to it 
[02:08:09] <rockworld> I know what I forgot to do now :p
[02:08:18] <Khaytsus> People get custom hostnames in irc confused with bindhost in znc for some reason.  Yes, if the host/ip are all valid you can put it there to specify which IP the znc listens on and connects from.  But it has to be valid ;)
[02:08:52] <rockworld> I know in past they was able to use custom vhost like this

[02:23:42] <bookworm> usually oidentd nowdays iirc
[02:24:02] <rockworld> [17:53] AUTO Please make sure identd is installed and properly configured on your router and/or firewall to allow connections from the internet on port 113 before you reconnect. Visit https://www.undernet.org/gline#identd for more information.
[02:24:54] <bookworm> so... do that?
[02:25:21] <bookworm> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Oidentd
[02:25:39] <rockworld> ok thanks thats a package that I need to install probably
[02:26:03] <bookworm> there's a bunch of things you could use, that's the one I know about
[02:26:33] <bookworm> you also need to forward / open an additional port etc
[02:27:31] <rockworld> port 113

[02:39:15] *** Joins: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c)
[02:39:30] <Khaytsus> But perhaps some networks require it, no idea.  I don't use anything except libera...  I'm on _one_ channel on efnet and slashnet.
[02:42:27] <MetaNova> from the wording of the (error? warning?) message from undernet, an ident response is either required or highly encouraged
[02:42:45] <MetaNova> either way it's trivial to just run an ident daemon with port 113 open if that's all that you require
[02:43:15] <MetaNova> >gline#identd
[02:43:34] <MetaNova> didn't notice the "gline" portion. looks like it's /required/ for your host/range at least
[02:45:36] <rockworld> MetaNova: any alternative package that I can use on debian machine ? for a ident daemon
[02:45:48] <MetaNova> debian has oidentd

[02:48:40] <rockworld> Im going to look on that, I have bullseyes last version fully updated

[02:55:34] <MetaNova> sweet
[02:57:27] <rockworld> so I need to configure that now 
[02:57:38] <MetaNova> no, actually
[02:57:56] <MetaNova> if your only requirements are to have a valid ident response (for Undernet) then all you need is:
[02:58:10] <MetaNova> 1) an ident daemon (installing oidentd resolved this)
[02:58:14] <rockworld> ok I just need to port forward
[02:58:18] <MetaNova> 2) port 113 is open in your firewall
[02:58:26] <rockworld> tcp or udp
[02:58:30] <MetaNova> tcp
[02:59:05] <rockworld> MetaNova: ok thank you, your help was greatly appreciate 
[02:59:12] <Khaytsus> I remember back in the day when channels would ban unidentified (from identd) users.  I bet that's still a thing on other networks.
[02:59:42] <MetaNova> you mean +b *!~*@*
[02:59:43] <MetaNova> lol
[02:59:46] <Khaytsus> zyrp
[02:59:48] <MetaNova> that's .... lame
[02:59:50] <rockworld> Khaytsus: they use a old system :)
[03:00:04] <Khaytsus> uh.. fingers in the right place this time
[03:00:09] <Khaytsus> yeap
[03:01:35] <rockworld> so I need to open port 6697 aswell in firewall 
[03:01:43] <rockworld> ?
[03:02:29] <MetaNova> no
[03:02:58] <rockworld> ok alright cause Im going to turn firewall on now hope I dont get disconnect

[08:41:38] <darkbasic92> Hello all. I cannot for the life of me manage to connect to ZNC using hexchat. I may be missing a setting, I'm not a pro at this, last error I got was "SSL handshake timed out". I am using the docker version and have configured it properly for the server, if I join with a different nick I can whois me just fine, but I probably can't type out my credentials properly in the password field?
[08:43:32] <Andrio> darkbasic92, can you connect using a web browser?
[08:45:38] <darkbasic92> I can connect to 6501 just fine which I did to configure it, I can't connect to the ZNC service itself, if that's what you're asking
[08:45:51] <Andrio> using HTTPS?
[08:45:58] <darkbasic92> No clue, moment
[08:46:22] <darkbasic92> Secure connection to 6501 doesn't work, only plain http
[08:46:40] <darkbasic92> Like my homelab ip is 192.168.1.200 if I go with https://192.168.1.200:6501 I can't connect at all
[08:47:13] <darkbasic92> Moment, I may be lying, rofl
[08:47:27] <darkbasic92> I forgot I turned it off so I could connect with my proper nickname, I couldn't join without nickserv auth here
[08:48:47] <darkbasic92> Nop, plain http works fine, https doesn't
[08:49:04] <Andrio> If you don't have that port number configured for TLS connections, trying to connect over TLS won't work.
[08:49:19] <Andrio> You should set up a different port for TLS.
[08:50:09] <darkbasic92> I don't remember trying to join securely? I never tried to configure TLS or anything of the like, and in my previous setup it was working just fine without any special configuration, just formatted before saving my config and I don't remember anything anymore
[08:50:49] <darkbasic92> I think what I'm mostly missing is how I should properly format my username:password thingy in hexchat? ZNC does join properly, I just can't connect to it from my desktop
[08:51:29] <Andrio> That's not the issue.
[08:51:35] <Andrio> Your client is trying to do a TLS handshake
[08:51:45] <Andrio> that won't work if you don't have TLS configured on whatever it's connecting to.
[08:52:08] <Andrio> either set that up, or get HexChat to not use TLS
[08:52:24] <darkbasic92> Ah, that's probably all I needed then, gonna try
[08:52:26] <Andrio> (But if you don't use TLS you'll be sending your password in plain text over the network)
[08:53:30] <darkbasic92> Waiting for it to time out again so I can paste the exact error
[08:54:54] <darkbasic92> SSL handshake timed out
[08:55:19] <Andrio> still using SSL/TLS incorrectly.
[08:55:45] <darkbasic92> Alright, I'll look into it further, I assume I don't need to config something on ZNC's end, it's all my fault on the desktop end?
[09:02:08] <darkbasic92> Got it, it was my fault for not being able to connect, got SSL working on ZNC's part and now hexchat connects. It now complains of a self-signed certificate, I assume I'll have to accept invalid certs for ZNC?
[09:04:14] <Andrio> or get a Let's Encrypt certificate.
[09:05:23] <darkbasic92> Thanks for the help, that amount of security is really not as important to me, I just accepted invalid and it worked fine.
