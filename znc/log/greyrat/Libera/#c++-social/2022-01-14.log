[10:44:21] <Carbonflux> don't fix it if its not broken.
[10:50:06] <MaNI> thats our power utilities attitude as well, it hasn't worked out great ;) 
[10:51:25] <Renderwww> but it your power utilities fulfill the "it's not broken" in from the start?
[10:55:41] <Carbonflux> heh, i mean stuff thats really not broken, not fake not broken.
[10:56:45] <Carbonflux> anyway, its an old saying, so its overboard.

[13:18:02] <Crocodillian> the title of my next book will be 'Effective Modern Terrorism'
[13:19:08] <ERROH> p. nice
[13:19:29] <ERROH> make sure it says something about ponies in warfare
[13:19:59] <Crocodillian> Absolutely, and I will make full use of the new features in Terrorism20.
[13:29:38] <Crocodillian> I will help people put 'terror' back in 'terrorism'.
[13:30:49] <Crocodillian> Because I live to serve.
[13:30:54] <N`aZ> make sure to have a section on how to do the same but using ancient terrorism version
[13:32:52] <Crocodillian> Actually, that's one of the concepts I need to cover. People often make the mistake of thinking they need an AR-15 when a dagger is sufficient and more appropriate for the task.
