[00:14:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Berlin36: DEAUTH packets don't require authentication. 
[00:14:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> 802.11w/WPA3 does rquire that.
[00:15:33] <Bco1981> Berlin36: how many devices you have that use internet ? on cable and on wifi. including the router ?
[00:16:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> WiFi in general sucks and should be replaced by wires whenever feasible.
[00:16:16] <Bco1981> ^
[00:16:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> WiFi maximizes convenience at the cost of reliability, speed and securit.
[00:17:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *security
[00:17:49] <Bco1981> steps you can take to make it harder for others to abuse your wifi.
[00:18:00] <Bco1981> Make your dhcp scope smaller.
[00:18:25] <Bco1981> reserve ip adresses with your devices mac-addresses
[00:18:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Preallocate MAC addresses and whitelist outgoing IP addresses.
[00:18:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or rather, whitelist IP addresses allowed switch/LAN side
[00:19:33] <Bco1981> change the ip adresses to something "non-standard" so not 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0
[00:19:57] <Bco1981> but 10.123.234.0 255.255.255.192
[00:19:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Dangerous advice that. LAN addresses should be allocated within private address ranges if you don't want problems.
[00:20:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Well, 10.123.0.0/16 is still within 10.0.0.0/8, that's fine
[00:20:41] <Bco1981> just be aware that 255.255.255.192 only has 30 usable ip adresses.
[00:20:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> aye
[00:21:42] <Bco1981> correction 62
[00:22:05] <Bco1981> it's 255.255.255.224 that only has 30
[00:22:26] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: do you need my subnetting class?
[00:22:53] <Bco1981> yeah, it's been some 20+ years... i could use some refresh
[00:22:58] <ButterNoodle> :)
[00:23:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> 10.123.234.0/26
[00:23:25] <ButterNoodle> you wanna learn ipv6 while ur at it? it will only add 10x the time
[00:23:52] <ButterNoodle> Aurora_v_kosmose: u picking 123 .234 at random?
[00:24:00] <Bco1981> Aurora_v_kosmose: starting from 0 is too easy. 192
[00:24:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: I just repeated what Bco1981 picked

[00:24:17] <ButterNoodle> always pick something that is subnettable
[00:24:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Honestly as far as I'm concerned WiFi is doomed from the start as far as this goes.
[00:24:37] <Bco1981> but... it is ?
[00:24:42] <ButterNoodle> dont make a noob mistake like I did and pick something in the middle and now its too much of a pita to change it 20 years later
[00:24:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> WPA2/PRO is basically the only way to make it half work.
[00:25:07] <ButterNoodle> and then everything is a summary route with ur stuff somewhere in the middle
[00:25:13] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: re:subnetting
[00:25:37] <ButterNoodle> I mean 172s are nice too
[00:25:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There's no particular reason you can't just offset from y.x.123.0 and give it more than /24

[00:34:26] <Berlin36_> oh
[00:34:28] <ButterNoodle> the only think I have on APs are phones/tablets, and when I walk around w a laptop
[00:34:33] <emmeka> it's a lot nicer than bluetooth, but operating on the same frequency
[00:34:40] <Berlin36_> i see
[00:34:46] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: #metoo
[00:34:53] <Berlin36_> bluetooth affects wifi speed tho
[00:34:54] <ButterNoodle> APs are set to a reasonable power level and are within a few feet of where its used
[00:35:02] <ButterNoodle> Berlin36_: only on 2.4
[00:35:03] <Bco1981> when not walking around with the laptop, then it has cable
[00:35:04] <Berlin36_> unless you have 5GHz wifi
[00:35:07] <Berlin36_> yes
[00:35:07] <emmeka> yeah, bluetooth is 2.4ghz as well... it's crowded

[00:35:28] <Berlin36_> what laptop do u use Bco?
[00:35:59] <emmeka> my router, that ButterNoodle recommended me, is dual band so I can just use 5 and it's k. However the thing has stupid antenna gain, so when 2.4ghz is on, I can use the wifi 300ft away from home... so I turn it on every so often if I want wifi out in the field

[07:28:24] <isekaijin> Aurora_v_kosmose: And you expect ordinary people to know how radios work.
[07:28:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ...
[07:28:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> We've been saying that global trading and unnecessary tourism would lead to unnecessary pandemics for half a century now.
[07:29:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If anything it's astoundingly surprising it didn't happen before
[07:29:39] <isekaijin> Well, that makes sense. People move around too much. Good for the economy, but also ‚Äúgood‚Äù for the transmission of diseases.
[07:30:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I can even cite books mentioning it and bioterrorism as increasingly credible and low-budget risks, from the 80s
[07:31:12] <amigojapan> Define "move around too much"if I had not come to Japan my life would be completely different now
[07:31:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: A lot of people seem to travel for the sake of traveling or to keep with the Johneses (sp?)
[07:32:00] <isekaijin> amigojapan: Settling in another country is okay.
[07:32:10] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: my life in Japan started out as tourism
[07:32:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> While tourism might be interesting, it's an unnecessary risk.
[07:32:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: For the sake of tourism or scouting what you already considered?
[07:33:21] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: it was an extension of studying Japanese which was an extension of watching sailor moon
[07:33:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> huh
[07:34:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But yeah, I never understood why sterilizing international packages and quarantine for travel wasn't a thing anymore.
[07:34:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Yes you can sterilize electronics safely, it's just more expensive and slightly more complicated)
[07:36:28] <amigojapan> isekaijin: I don't think I would settled in Japan if I had not travelled here as a tourist first
[07:38:32] <amigojapan> Would have*
[07:41:24] <amigojapan> I don't think we should totally abandon tourism and become like what Japan was in the sakkoku period Aurora_v_kosmose , in every country
[07:42:58] <amigojapan> Tourism has many benefits. One of which is understanding other countries better
[07:44:17] <amigojapan> Even if it risks pandemics,a lot would be lost
[07:44:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Quarantines should be standard.

[08:03:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Hm, there's a bit of a distinction there to be made. For the most part it's just that your system shell also was primarily a basic interpreter

[08:04:14] <ButterNoodle> is that just for transport?
[08:04:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: One of the issues is that for a lot of such machines it couldn't have scaled that way. Not to allow multiple users or even just secure single-user use of the machine.
[08:04:27] <MootPoot> wym transport
[08:04:31] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: I cant find any willing for a reasonable price
[08:04:34] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: many many people learned programming thanks to needing to interact with basic
[08:04:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's not to say it couldn't be done. 
[08:04:44] <ButterNoodle> like just to get ur shit from the car to the capsite
[08:04:50] <ButterNoodle> not carry on ur back for 50 miles
[08:04:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> LispMs could. And they could easily have been extended to what the LispOS papers talk about.
[08:05:02] <MootPoot> yeah, maybe like a 2-3 hour hike tops

[08:06:49] <amigojapan> I see Aurora_v_kosmose 
[08:07:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: So I'm effectively still in the paradigm of "I don't like what my shell is doing, lemme toggle settings or rewrite the functions for that entirely"
[08:07:44] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: we ended up making GUI be based around things that are often found in an office environment
[08:07:50] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle:  I think the longest I'll ever go with just the backpack would be like 3-4 days
[08:08:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Thing is, it's mostly laziness and dumbing it down for interns.

[08:08:28] <MootPoot> u callin me dumb
[08:08:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Back in the days where no one had computers at home except programmers because they were stupidly expensive.
[08:08:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> New Car price expensive.
[08:08:55] <MootPoot> the time before time
[08:09:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yes, to which we owe a lot of our problems.
[08:09:30] <MootPoot> as we all know, time started at January 1, 1970
[08:09:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> LispM OSes and Plan 9 demonstrate programmable GUI is very feasible.
[08:09:40] <MootPoot> everything before that is fake
[08:09:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> No one bothers to however.
[08:09:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Well. That's not quite true.
[08:10:18] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle:  is 40L enough for 3 or 4 ays
[08:10:19] <MootPoot> days
[08:10:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Some Lisp hobbyists try their hand at making window managers and compositors that can do that... and then promptly get distracted by life and their WIP in project goes dormant
[08:12:34] <omero> I wonder why we are still using keyboards
[08:12:56] <MootPoot> becuse the only real alternative is typing on a flat board
[08:13:02] <MootPoot> and that is sexual harassment
[08:13:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That however I don't. There are precious little interaction methods that are as versatile. 
[08:13:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Also touchscreens have absurdly bad ergonomic properties.
[08:13:22] <omero> I mean... we could be all benefit interfacing a pianoforte for emacs
[08:13:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> >8h consistent piano usage gets pretty strainful
[08:14:22] <MootPoot> last time I used a piano for 8 hours was when I was 5 years old
[08:14:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> A better question is why trackballs were phased out in favor of unambiguously ergonomically worse mouses.
[08:14:40] <MootPoot> I got yelled at and told to stop sleeping on top of my uncles piano

[14:16:15] <Berlin36_> i understand functions
[14:16:23] <amigojapan> Ok
[14:16:35] <Berlin36_> but sometimes it may return more than only one thing
[14:16:43] <Berlin36_> for example a password and an encrypted string
[14:16:56] <Berlin36_> and i don't want to use cout im the function
[14:16:59] <amigojapan> Then return a struct

[14:17:09] <amigojapan> Or an object

[14:18:37] <Berlin36_> what type the function should be
[14:18:42] <amigojapan> Structs are for c
[14:19:52] <amigojapan> Berlin36_: the function can return any objects for example stringAndInt function(){

[15:54:16] <Sadale> so, cancer for me? xD
[15:54:26] <Sadale> nah. Just 33% more chance of cancer. I can afford that.
[15:54:27] <isekaijin> There has to be another alternative.
[15:54:35] <isekaijin> Fapping in the bathroom.

[16:03:19] <shinythings> In the lab, capsaicin seems to kill cells linked to more than 40 types of cancer, including the colon, liver, lung, and pancreatic cancers and leukemia. The spicy chemical changes how some genes linked with cancer cells act and even stops them from growing.
[16:06:49] <Macer> games end lives
[16:07:02] <isekaijin> shinythings: Yeah, but preventing cancer by eating chili does not sound anywhere as exciting as preventing cancer by fapping.

[20:05:35] <MootPoot> or my contract dosen't get renewed
[20:05:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Search for another job now. They've already made up their mind.
[20:06:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And it might be more of an excuse to avoid having to deal with employee raises by ensuring a fast turnover.
[20:06:21] <MootPoot> well, I'm on a internship atm
[20:06:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Some employers are scum
[20:06:30] <MootPoot> so govt pays 80% of my income
[20:06:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Well you've got your answer right there.
[20:06:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They don't want to pay your wage.
[20:06:56] <MootPoot> cant leave until its over ; if I do then I'll fail my internship course
[20:07:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's fine. I do mean, line up something after.
[20:07:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's obvious they never intended to keep you

[20:07:44] <MootPoot> since my internship ends on dec 1st
[20:08:05] <MootPoot> they got me to do some iOS work and I didnt really stick well to that
[20:08:34] <MootPoot> so now they're probably like "hes doing more then the 20% we pay him for" so they're probbaly just never going to renew my internship contract
[20:08:53] <MootPoot> my work contract I mean
[20:09:14] <MootPoot> usually as soon as internships are over they can keep you and give you a full time spot for much higher $$$
[20:09:30] <MootPoot> but I've heard multiple talks about how the "company cant hire any more till we get money coming in"
[20:09:45] <MootPoot> this is a small 8 person startup

[20:51:00] <Cryowolf> China is trying to take over the world through gaming, in particular on mobile phones. This is something we should all fear because once covid becomes cyberborn, the 5G will do what it was intended to do and infect the entire world. Only by using an app to protect us are we safe from death. An app China controls!I know this to be true because I just made it up in my head and the stability of my sanityt is questionable at best on a good day. There's no need 
[20:51:00] <Cryowolf> to look at me like that, I'm not crazy. You'll see once the Martians abduct us, the world is a gigantic flat antenna array the aliens use to communicate
[20:51:15] <hassoon> china is big
[20:51:32] <hassoon> 1.3M + of people? gimme a break
[20:51:52] <Cryowolf> what do you mean?
[20:51:53] <ButterNoodle> thats obviously a lie.. the lizard people are in control of china
[20:52:00] <hassoon> Cryowolf: Son.
[20:52:09] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, the lizard people are androids
[20:52:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> One of the issues with the theory of China domination is that they're culturally incompatible with a lot of the world. And to have even semi-stable mostly-global control would basically require them to change to so much the result would barely look the same.
[20:52:13] <hassoon> ButterNoodle: ya whoever is running the world
[20:52:19] <hassoon> ButterNoodle: same whoever made covid
[20:52:25] <ButterNoodle> yea lizard people
[20:52:30] * hassoon spears whoever runs the world and made covid
[20:52:34] <ButterNoodle> ever wonder why lizards are immune to covid?
[20:52:37] <MootPoot> is ARM the future
[20:52:42] <MootPoot> is x86 gonna die
[20:52:42] <hassoon> what's arm
[20:52:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Afaik they aren't

[20:53:03] <ButterNoodle> Aurora_v_kosmose: thats deer
[20:53:08] <ButterNoodle> they arent immune to covid
[20:53:12] <MootPoot> the problem with that is that nobody uses riscV
[20:53:18] <MootPoot> theres jsut a few test boards out
[20:53:20] <ButterNoodle> because it sounds racist

[20:53:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ARM is also going to fall back because the IP bullshit behind its cores and systems isn't conducive to use.
[20:54:07] * ButterNoodle remembers the alpha processor
[20:54:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> x86 will fail because it is, quite simply, not that good a spec in the first place.
[20:54:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's overcomplicated, cumbersome and just not that great.
[20:56:00] <ButterNoodle> thats real hard to imagine considering how much of the market share they have
[20:56:04] <blue_rog> > have we actually managed to do anything with distributed computing
[20:56:11] <blue_rog> MootPoot: yes?
[20:56:27] <blue_rog> Isn't a lot of the world just a shit ton of distributed computing
[20:56:39] <blue_rog> a lot of science research is
[20:56:47] <ButterNoodle> I mean the only shift away from x86 has been apple, and only recently from what I have read
[20:56:58] <Cryowolf> Aurora_v_kosmose, a lot of eastern countries are incompatible with western ones, but mentioning some of them would get me labeled a racist I'm sure
[20:57:11] <blue_rog> I really want RISC-V to succeed
[20:57:47] <blue_rog> Until people come along and add propiertary instructions for 'efficiency and board specific things
[20:58:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cryowolf: There's a reason after all that when genocide wasn't done only because of pragmatic concerns rather than ethical concerns, a lot of times concessions were made to instead keep local populations relatively happy by taking and tweaking bits of culture they already had.
[20:58:28] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose:  ehhh..I mean ARM is still everywhere thouggh
[20:58:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Imposing entirely different systems of values tends to lead to a much higher likelihood of revolt
[20:58:39] <MootPoot> dont underestimate the inertia of legacy
[20:59:02] <MootPoot> people like to shit on anything non open source, but imo the "open source will always win in the end" is a bit of a fantasy tbh
[20:59:12] <MootPoot> just look at all of our x86 development
[20:59:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> just look at the endgame of encroaching IP bullshit.
[20:59:27] <MootPoot> companies like working with other private companies
[20:59:29] <blue_rog> intertia of legacy ... that's a really nice way of puttin git
[20:59:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Eventually ou won't be able to get anything done without working FOSS
[20:59:42] <MootPoot> I dont like it..but IP bullshit is here to stay
[20:59:49] <Cryowolf> how do I reset appearance of adilirc? My buttons look weird
[21:00:00] <Urchin[emacs]> AFAIK, x86 processors are really RISC processors that virtualize x86
[21:00:06] <MootPoot> wat

[21:00:10] <MootPoot> how

[21:00:16] <blue_rog> what
[21:00:36] <MootPoot> why
[21:00:47] *** Geela is now known as sscout
[21:00:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Probably easier to actually design efficient electronics for.
[21:01:01] <MootPoot> what does a x86 have to gain from emulating RISC unless it needs to run RISC code
[21:01:07] <MootPoot> which they dont in most cases
[21:01:15] <blue_rog> x86 has 1500+ instructions. risc-v has less than 500
[21:01:30] <MootPoot> what about normal ARM 64
[21:01:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Trapping yourself into legacy support when you've long realized that your original design was shit but you can't just change it now.
[21:01:40] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: sad but true
[21:02:33] <blue_rog> I'm not sure about ARM
[21:02:44] <blue_rog> but i do know that some instructions are crazy long
[21:02:53] <blue_rog> and they're so specific
[21:03:09] <MootPoot> why the fuck are cheap android devices available
[21:03:26] <MootPoot> but similarly specced SBC dev/tinker boards over 2x the price
[21:03:40] <blue_rog> supply chain?
[21:03:42] <sscout> volume?
[21:03:45] <blue_rog> they mass produce them
[21:04:06] <blue_rog> tinker boards aren't made in the same amounts as android phones
[21:04:28] <blue_rog> plus the modular alternatives you can get from countries like china are really cheap
[21:04:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Some phone boards can be reused though.
[21:04:38] <MootPoot> yeah..but you would think they could just do^
[21:04:46] <MootPoot> with some extra connectors stuck on
[21:05:06] <rando25892> they must take their plans to another project
[21:05:10] <blue_rog> for tinkerboards, they want good quality cause the people who buy them want good and reliable quality
[21:05:49] <blue_rog> the set of people who want to buy cheap android phones do not necessarily care about the quality of individual components
[21:06:01] <MootPoot> ehhh
[21:06:02] <MootPoot> I mean 
[21:06:15] <MootPoot> its not like those cheap android phones stop working after 5min
[21:06:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They're built to be disposable crap.
[21:06:28] <MootPoot> they last years as well, its the software bloat that kills them
[21:06:36] <rando25892> you can lump them together then think about if they want an all open bootloader or not
[21:06:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> We get them priced at >60$ a piece, but they probably cost max 1$ a piece to build
[21:07:13] <MootPoot> the cheapest linux capable board I can get here is like 40 bucks for a raspi zero
[21:07:15] <MootPoot> which is pretty sad
[21:07:16] <MootPoot> tbh
[21:07:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> rando25892: Open bootloader doesn't matter so long as the memory is reprogrammable, just use jtag or some other similar method.
[21:07:40] <Cryowolf> If I upgrade my phone (or rather when), my main concern is that it's fast enough to handle browsing, video watching, some games, some music. That it's a budget phone, 5g compatible and doesn't break after 2 seconds of use
[21:08:08] <rando25892> hmm oh ok yea i figure that open bootloader would be nice on really bad bios devices other than reflashing with the origina bios bin
[21:08:09] <blue_rog> so the dude's family my cousin got married to own a really big charger factory + r&d wing. They go to china (at least used to pre-covid) very often. He told me that individual components are made by companies in such large quantities with not great QC standards and that's why they're cheap 
[21:08:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> iirc
[21:08:27] <blue_rog> For better QC, you need to pay more
[21:09:05] <MootPoot> actually, fuck it
[21:09:11] <MootPoot> is there a good way to just slave android phones
[21:09:15] <MootPoot> and make them do the compute
[21:09:25] <blue_rog> wait
[21:09:27] <MootPoot> maybe have like a board you can OTG or something to with your android phone
[21:09:31] <blue_rog> what do you mean 40 buck for a raspi 0
[21:09:33] <MootPoot> and then use the GPIO from teh board
[21:09:39] <MootPoot> blue_rog:  thats what I pay here
[21:09:41] <blue_rog> isn't it $5 (in the US)
[21:09:42] <blue_rog> ah okay
[21:09:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Afaik the bootloader in phones is the lowest-level firmware in the device and sticks around between reflashings.
[21:09:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> What you need is to be able to overwrite that too
[21:10:20] <rando25892> what is an rpi 0 a raspberry that doesnt work?
