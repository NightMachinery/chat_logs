[00:04:22] <Nanobot> It was caused by one of PG&E's faulty power lines. Again. Just like every year.
[00:05:17] <Bco1981> oh... their insurrance must be unimaginable expensive.
[00:05:23] <Nanobot> Climate change is just the reason the fires are hard to control. We're in the middle of a drought (again).
[00:05:52] <Nanobot> Bco1981: I mean, they go into bankruptcy just about every year.
[00:06:23] <Nanobot> But they're a monopoly. They're *the* power company in California. The state government keeps them alive, because the alternative is nobody has power.
[00:07:19] <Bco1981> so, the state government keeps killing people by not getting those power lines fixed.
[00:07:45] <Nanobot> A few years ago, my peak month for energy costs was about $600. This year, it's over $800, because PG&E rose the prices. And you can bet they'll be $1000 pretty soon. Despite me using less energy each year.
[00:08:57] <Bco1981> you planning on some solar panels ?
[00:09:17] <Bco1981> a wind mill ?
[00:09:49] <Nanobot> I'll go through the process of getting an estimate on those after I retire. Last time, they figured I'd save about $80/year when all was accounted for. Which wasn't worth it.
[00:10:01] <Bco1981> or are there unreasonable taxations and regulations with generating your own power over there too ??

[00:21:51] <MootPoot> Worked wonders for me
[00:22:07] <MootPoot> Both during wildfires and normally
[00:23:02] <Bco1981> that doesn't clog up like the AC ?
[00:23:15] <MootPoot> You can get a HEPA one that you have to replace filters for or a ifD one like I have where the filter is permanent and washable but you get less overall throughput
[00:23:31] <MootPoot> Bco1981: wym, if anything it keeps my ac from clogging
[00:23:49] <MootPoot> Also doubles over as a standing fan
[00:25:02] <Bco1981> you said the other day your AC was clogged up, so it was generating ice. but if you have air purifier... then it must be really bad air in your room.
[00:25:24] <MootPoot> Well, my ac dosent clog anymore
[00:25:29] <MootPoot> Or even get dirty
[00:25:35] <Bco1981> ah okay
[00:25:36] <MootPoot> Same with dust on things
[00:28:24] <MootPoot> It was over double the price of a HEPA model
[00:28:29] <MootPoot> For the same size room
[00:28:51] <MootPoot> But....I never need to care about buying new 40 dollar filters 
[00:29:03] <MootPoot> 4 times a year so the math works out
[00:29:29] <Nanobot> MootPoot: I have an air purifier. It can only do so much. I still have to use a mask, and I can still smell smoke.
[00:30:45] <MootPoot> Nanobot: do you live in an old place that's not really airtight?
[00:30:56] <MootPoot> Its time to crank it up
[00:31:03] <Nanobot> This house was built in the 1950s, like most of the houses in this area.
[00:31:05] <MootPoot> Get 3 air purifiers
[00:31:08] <MootPoot> Oof
[00:31:21] <MootPoot> Yeah that's not good air sealant
[00:31:24] <Nanobot> I'm using towels to try to seal some of the gaps, like under my front door.

[03:04:10] <rando25892> i dont recognize the anime
[03:09:29] <sentionics> rando25892: it appears to just be a song using a Touhou character ('Seija' it seems) for some of the visuals.
[03:09:52] <sentionics> *not an actual anime
[03:10:08] <rando25892> oh ok
[03:14:54] <Nanobot> I set my tab indentation width to 8 spaces, and I sometimes wish I could set it higher. Roast me.
[03:16:23] <sentionics> Nanobot: so long as you don't care about the 80 width line convention, I have nothing to say on the matter.
[03:17:50] <sentionics> when a lot if not most of us are coding with decent sized monitors, 80, nay, even 120 width line caps are kinda outdated.
[03:17:57] <Nanobot> I'm a fan of keeping *comments* down to 80 characters per line *after the indentation*. Just because that's a nice line length for readability. But I have yet to see an editor that helps to highlight where "80 characters after the indentation" is.
[03:18:23] <sentionics> but I get people wanting to split their editor windows, where it could matter once again
[03:19:14] <sentionics> (of course, word-wrap usually is pretty keen for such situations)
[03:19:45] <sentionics> IMO, line width getting long for code is just a sign you need to refactor that line. Break it down for readability's sake.
[03:20:07] <Nanobot> I find word wrap perfectly fine as long as it isn't just silly long. Like, if it's wrapping to 8 lines when my editor is maximized, then that line could use some reformatting.
[03:20:39] <sentionics> lol, 8 lines
[03:20:53] <sentionics> sounds like 8 functions that could be made into
[03:21:02] <Nanobot> I've come across code where a single line wrapped to about half my screen height.
[03:21:13] <sentionics> j/k, but one good function for where that's neatly broken down, would be keen
[03:21:54] <sentionics> wtf. Code obfuscation is a job security technique used by some in the past I guess.

[03:24:59] <Roey> er
[03:25:03] <sentionics> less code is not always better code.
[03:25:05] <Roey> map/filter
[03:25:57] <sentionics> Roey: admittedly, I need to use functional stuff like map/filter/reduce more.
[03:26:27] <Roey> aye
[03:26:40] <Nanobot> I pretty much never use map/filter functions. It makes it slower just for the sake of avoiding a loop, which really isn't much more effort.
[03:26:41] <Roey> sentionics: well list comprehensions did away with much of the need for map/filter/reduce
[03:26:43] <Roey> admittedly
[03:26:54] <Roey> and lambda: inside them
[03:27:13] <sentionics> I do advocate for avoiding global state as much as possible (though, I tend to just pass around a god state object admittedly, which is probably not that much better)

[06:06:07] <sentionics> mathu: yes. I have to.
[06:06:12] <mathu> hell yeah
[06:06:23] <sentionics> giving up means accepting an early death.
[06:06:43] <sentionics> dying to liver failure is quite horrible I hear.
[06:07:13] <mathu> so i hear as well
[06:07:32] <sentionics> I'm already 35, probably getting close to that point where the binges put me into liver cancer territory
[06:07:45] <sentionics> or at least, significant liver damage territory
[06:08:13] <mathu> good time to quit then
[06:08:21] <sentionics> yeah
[06:08:34] <sentionics> quitting often comes with lots of false-starts. Tenacity is key
[06:08:38] <mathu> i'm trying to find a link to basically a webcomic diary of a guy that was trying to quit alcohol in case you'd find it, like, relatable
[06:08:39] <sentionics> "never give up"
[06:09:05] <sentionics> heh, mathu, you're a nice guy, ha ha
[06:09:45] <sentionics> again, I'm a bit drunk, but if you find it, probably good to share it with me tomorrow or something
[06:09:59] <sentionics> when I'm drunk, my memory isn't the best
[06:10:24] <sentionics> but I feel like I'd probably remember if you linked me
[06:10:29] <mathu> you're also a nice guy and i'm glad to hear you want to keep trying quitting. that's uhh not how you used to sound when the idea came up lol
[06:11:01] <sentionics> I got blackout drunk a lot. much of what I said/did, I scarcely remembered the next day
[06:11:13] <sentionics> though, I did remember quite a bit
[06:12:13] <mathu> sentionics: https://imgur.com/gallery/TaIqIkJ found it, i can link it again next time i see you if i remember

[06:12:29] <sentionics> Thanks mathu. Glad you think I'm a nice guy. It really is my nature to be 'nice'. Though the subtle thing about that is 'nice' doesn't equal 'kind'.
[06:13:28] <sentionics> logged the link on my todo log (I'll find a better place for it later, but I have this log file open all day long everyday now)

[11:32:08] <sentionics> Bco1981: Microsoft is getting more and more aggressive with forcing their invasive bullshit
[11:32:15] <Bco1981> yes
[11:32:18] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: even the pro/enterprise?
[11:32:40] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle:not 100% sure yet with those.
[11:32:50] <ButterNoodle> cause that doesnt make sense
[11:33:00] <Bco1981> true, AD and all.
[11:33:05] <sentionics> Bco1981: win 10 is nicer than win7 UX-wise. But I feel it's most definitely spying it's ass off on me.
[11:33:18] <ButterNoodle> wonder how many more domains I'll need to black hole on my dns
[11:33:20] <Bco1981> sentionics: yeah
[11:33:23] <sentionics> Microsoft knows I usually beat off in the mornings.
[11:33:35] <ButterNoodle> well initially win10s ux was dogshit
[11:33:48] <ButterNoodle> it took a few years to not be so shitty
[11:34:00] <sentionics> oh, didn't know that
[11:34:20] <ButterNoodle> first release I used some shit to make it look like 7
[11:34:27] <sentionics> lol
[11:34:43] <ButterNoodle> i think after the first major version upgrade it started looking more usable
[11:34:44] <sentionics> instead of just use 7, please just kinda almost be 7
[11:34:50] <Bco1981> on windows 7 i usually set it to classic
[11:34:53] <ButterNoodle> now its more like 7
[11:35:13] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: did u make 7 look like XP

[12:07:17] <sentionics> don't keep me on life support
[12:07:19] <sentionics> gods no
[12:07:22] <sentionics> just let me go
[12:07:43] <DunceCotus> let you go where?
[12:08:04] <sentionics> the problem with choosing your end is, a lot of societies don't want you to have that choice
[12:08:25] <sentionics> I don't want to die
[12:08:54] <sentionics> but I recognize a time will come that the benefits of being alive will sink below that of the benefits of being dead.
[12:09:17] <DunceCotus> im not sure life/death works like that
[12:09:29] <sentionics> that's dark, but I feel that's a realistic assessment.
[12:10:02] <sentionics> if I'm doomed to be in pain until death. Death might be the last remaining relief.
[12:10:27] <sentionics> This is being realistic.
[12:10:30] <amigojapan> sentionics: once they put you on life support you probably won't be able to euthanise yourself and you likely won't know when that is until it is too late
[12:10:50] <Cryowolf> I do think that if someone is suffering and they have no chance at a normal life, or they are dying and are in great physical and mental pain. They should have the right to choose to die. However, no doctor should be forced to give or inject the deadly drugs
[12:10:57] <sentionics> life support sounds like prison
[12:11:19] <sentionics> I need to establish my will, no life support
[12:11:30] <Cryowolf> but this should be decided by doctors and professionals and not just the person saying "I want to die" randomly
[12:11:39] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: it was a pro version this one, and i can still set all the things with the windows update, even the ip and disable other allowed sources. so gpedit.msc still works.
[12:12:04] <Bco1981> so right now... i'm not so scared of win11 anymore
[12:12:14] <Bco1981> aslong as they keep these features.
[12:12:21] <Cryowolf> sentionics, there are laws in many countries with a do not resuscitate clause you can fill in. Meaning they cant bring you back if you die or keep you artificially alive
[12:12:30] <Cryowolf> if your body cant do it on its own
[12:15:51] <amigojapan> Brb shower
[12:17:59] <Cryowolf> if W11 is free and I can still have at least the same kind of privacy as I have now, if I can still make the same kind of changes, if I have the same control over the interface and file system etc....If they don't take away but only add, then I don't mind. But I dunno anything about it
[12:18:19] <Bco1981> kinda annoying i can't run task manager from the rightclick on taskbar anymore
[12:18:28] <Cryowolf> and my brain isnt in a capable mood to read any articles, but it can watch videos

[12:19:11] <Cryowolf> oh
[12:19:17] <Cryowolf> you can upgrade already?
[12:19:25] <Bco1981> yeah
[12:19:47] <Bco1981> in windows 10 you can set some beta channel i think it was and get windows 11 as an update
[12:19:56] <Bco1981> but, i got a iso to test with
[12:20:11] <Bco1981> not risking my own OS on testing.
[12:20:28] <Cryowolf> oh ok
[12:20:33] <Cryowolf> yeah Im not risking my os either

[12:20:55] <Cryowolf> it is? that's good
[12:21:20] <Cryowolf> I mean itwould be dumb if you couldn't...cause then if someones internet is down, their computer stops working
[12:21:24] <Bco1981> and that centered task bar, is still possible to have at the left side.
[12:21:50] <Cryowolf> centered?

[12:55:40] <Cryowolf> TPM sounds like some pretty DRM like stuff
[12:55:43] <Cryowolf> very annoying
[12:56:21] <Cryowolf> I guess I will wait until they hack it well enough before I install it for my mom :P
[12:56:22] <amigojapan> Alright Bco1981 
[12:56:27] <Cryowolf> but I own a license
[12:58:14] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: and it seems that if you enable TPM you must also enable secureboot, which will limit the kinds of Linux you can dual boot to
[12:58:24] <Bco1981> ^
[12:58:50] <theholyduck> i think most linux distros support it though?
[12:59:03] <theholyduck> + you can sign your own binaries for it if needs be
[12:59:14] <Bco1981> theholyduck: that's not what Andy said
[12:59:15] <theholyduck> sooo. you can still compile your own kernel or whatever
[12:59:22] <Bco1981> i bet he tested it
[12:59:33] <Sapphirus> They do. Microsoft's signing keys were leaked awhile back.
[12:59:33] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: its not really drm at all. 
[13:00:02] <Sapphirus> Depends on if the distro in question uses those keys or if you have to go in and setup your own keystore.
[13:00:02] <theholyduck> Sapphirus:  i think even besides that its just supported
[13:00:15] <tastythings> I see katrinplommon are used to make prunes
[13:00:35] <Sapphirus> theholyduck, so as long as signing isn't enforced, I suppose.

[13:04:08] <Katrin> theholyduck: a bunch of devices with odd bootloaders
[13:04:33] <theholyduck> Bco1981:  it hasnt been updated in half a decade. it was barely updated the half a decade before that
[13:04:34] <theholyduck> ?
[13:04:38] <Katrin> Bco1981: even before grub2 lilo lagged behind imho
[13:04:39] <theholyduck> as far as i know it doesnt support uefi
[13:04:49] <Sapphirus> I'm still using legacy boot here.
[13:04:50] <theholyduck> it doesnt support secureboot apparently
[13:04:54] <Sapphirus> I see no problem with it :P
[13:05:14] <theholyduck> like. ive been using linux since 2004
[13:05:24] <theholyduck> and ive always been using grub. 
[13:05:35] <theholyduck> because lilo was always that anicent ass thing that never updates
[13:05:42] <Sapphirus> A device that doesn't allow me to enable legacy boot is not a device I want to use.
[13:05:53] <Sapphirus> Possible to use GPT partition table with legacy boot, too.
[13:06:05] <theholyduck> ok so there IS a UEFI compatible lilo but its also disabled
[13:06:15] <theholyduck> Sapphirus:  i mean having the option for legacy boot is fine i guess
[13:06:35] <theholyduck> i prefer uefi booting now that it is an option
[13:06:44] <theholyduck> *its also discontinued
[13:06:53] <theholyduck> anyways. i think my point is dont use fucking lilo
[13:06:58] <theholyduck> its efi compatible release was in 2013
[13:07:06] <theholyduck> and its last non efi compatible release was in 2015
[13:07:20] <theholyduck> meanwhile there last grub update was 50 days ago
[13:07:22] <Sapphirus> What advantage is there to UEFI booting without secure boot?

[13:08:46] <Cryowolf> but I understand why people like linux
[13:08:53] <Sapphirus> Faster boot time, or nah?

[13:13:29] <Sapphirus> theholyduck, it's possible to boot a GPT partition from legacy bios boot, so I don't see larger partition sizes being an advantage of UEFI. 
[13:13:39] <Sapphirus> Just not with Windows, I don't think.

[13:14:38] <theholyduck> but whatever
[13:15:21] <Sapphirus> There's a legacy boot flag you set in the GPT partition table with a partitioning utility.

[13:19:16] <Sapphirus> Grub supports this.
[13:19:17] <Bco1981> Sapphirus: UEFI advantages: ∙ Fast booting - UEFI can directly boot the operating system and save the BIOS selftest process. And also eliminates the time to switch to CSM mode during POST.
[13:19:20] <Cryowolf> Bco1981. I guess it does then ;D
[13:19:27] <Bco1981> Supports for hard drive partitions larger than 2 TB.
[13:19:34] <Bco1981> ∙ Supports more than 4 primary partitions with a GUID Partition Table (GPT).
[13:19:42] <Cryowolf> ok then I must be running uefi cause Im running a 4tb one
[13:19:46] <Bco1981> Supports unlimited number of partitions.    (i doubt that)
[13:19:54] <Sapphirus> Bco1981, you can boot GPT with bios boot, though.
[13:19:55] <Bco1981> Supports full capabilities of new devices - new devices may not provide backward
[13:19:56] <Bco1981> compatibility
[13:20:04] <Cryowolf> I dont doubt it, you can serial connect them
[13:20:08] <Bco1981> Supports secure startup - UEFI can check the validity of the operating system to
[13:20:09] <Bco1981> ensure that no malware tampers with the startup process.

[13:24:38] <Bco1981> amigojapan: that's probably not signed, so you need to disable secure boot.
[13:24:50] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: it only mentions a connector, not a module

[13:25:13] <amigojapan> I see Bco1981 
[13:25:49] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, well if w11 cant be run with a 5600x compatible motherboard on a b550 chip, they
[13:25:55] <Cryowolf> they gonna have a lot of people not upgrading
[13:26:16] <Cryowolf> so Im pretty sure this can run w11
[13:26:54] <Sapphirus> This HEDT system of mine from 2015 can't even run Windows 11 with the TPM requirement.
[13:27:10] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: if there is some module connected to the JTMP1 then yes, you can wun w11. if not. no
[13:27:17] <Sapphirus> I could plop a 22 core broadwell xeon in here but I can't boot WIndows 11. lol

[13:27:45] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, I don't see why a mobo that can run 5600x etc would be so antiquated as to not have those things
[13:27:48] <Sapphirus> Completely arbitrary requirement by Microsoft to force people to replace perfectly workable hardware.
[13:28:03] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: talk to M$ about that.
[13:28:04] <Cryowolf> but if I cant install w11, I wont
[13:28:11] <Cryowolf> cause I cant afford new hardware
[13:28:12] <Bco1981> this is windows 11 Requirements
[13:28:16] <Cryowolf> so Ill stay on w10 then
[13:28:28] <Bco1981> you just need that module,
[13:28:37] <Bco1981> not a complet new pc
[13:28:57] <Sapphirus> Good luck finding a module when there's no standard module interface.
[13:28:58] <Cryowolf> so I can buy a pci-e module for a few euro?
[13:29:24] <Sapphirus> And better luck to you, if modules are not even manufactured for your motherboard, anymore.
[13:29:28] <Bco1981> tpm2.0 modules are sold on ebay, said linus LTT
[13:29:46] <Sapphirus> Yeah, but there's no standard interface for them.
[13:29:54] <Sapphirus> So you'll have to hope you can find one that works with your motherboard
[13:29:55] <Bco1981> ^
[13:30:31] <Sapphirus> With the latest Ryzen chipset, there shouldn't be any issues supporting TPM 2.0.
[13:30:48] <Cryowolf> thats why Im saying, since I run 5600x, I should be safe
[13:31:05] <Sapphirus> Now if you're running X99, like myself, or something in its age range, you'll be quite SoL if you want to run Windows 11.
[13:34:49] <Sapphirus> I think it's best to put emphasis on how this requirement is completely arbitrary and only serves to make PC manufacturers some dough.
[13:36:26] <Cryowolf> if I can run local on W11 Home, I will prolly upgrade
[13:36:37] <Cryowolf> but if they restrict W11 Home more than W10 Home, I won

[14:43:32] <Katrin> pls
[14:44:43] <amigojapan> tastythings: that's a terrible translation. Better older sis cat
[14:45:29] <tastythings> there's no way to fix it
[14:45:31] <Katrin> amigojapan: Germany has mostly dropped honorificts these days q.q

[14:46:20] <tastythings> the transistors know nothing, lol
[14:46:30] <Katrin> People barely use second person in polite form anymore
[14:47:16] <amigojapan> Katrin: you mean like ustedes in Spanish?
[14:47:35] <amigojapan> I mean usted
[14:48:09] <Katrin> amigojapan: Mostly the use of "Sie" is in decline, but also other local honorifics
[14:48:28] <Katrin> I don't even remember them properly as they were pretty out of fashion already in my youth
[14:48:40] <Katrin> and you'd only see them in old German TV shows
[14:49:55] <amigojapan> Katrin: maybe every language will become like English after dropping honorifics
[14:51:35] <amigojapan> Katrin: yeah usted in Spanish is sie in German
[14:51:59] <Katrin> amigojapan: That would be horrible
[14:52:04] <Katrin> Language shapes thought
[14:52:14] <Katrin> If we cannot think polite, how can we act polite?
[14:52:23] <Publios> lots of languages drop honorifics - it is common
[14:52:23] <amigojapan> Katrin: I still used it for some family members when I was a kid
[14:52:27] <Publios> there are other ways to be polite
[14:52:40] <tastythings> is gegege mostly about people disappearing because of some youkai and then coming back at the end of the episode after they fight the youkai?

[14:56:16] <Sapphirus> I don't like the taste of dark chocolate, hot chocolate, coffee or tea.

[14:56:36] <Sapphirus> Warm beverages in general and bitter things are awful

[15:00:26] <Bco1981> there is this underlaying taste in beer, that i just don't like
[15:00:34] <Sapphirus> Bco1981, I don't like beer, although I've never tried wine.

[17:30:12] <Roey> it's a concept from an episode of South Park; it's when producers put in references to previous shows in an effort to reel you in

[17:36:11] <Roey> yeah but I mean,
[17:36:30] <DunceCotus> you mean they didn't act like space pirats
[17:36:32] <Roey> the characters were /professionals/ doing a /job/
[17:36:33] <DunceCotus> *pirates
[17:36:42] <Berlin36> amigojapan, oh okay, btw i use weechat from android now
[17:36:44] <Roey> here the characters are not professionals, and they're only going where the wind takes them
[17:36:51] <Berlin36> in Termux
[17:36:57] <Berlin36> looks pretty cool
[17:37:00] <amigojapan> Ah ok Berlin36 
[17:38:16] <Berlin36> can i disable the bar that shows the time?
[17:38:39] <Berlin36> it's not really needed and it takes a lot of space
[17:39:01] <DunceCotus> Berlin36 ?
[17:39:16] <amigojapan> Dunno Berlin36 
[17:40:13] <Roey> Anyone else here watched Star Trek: Lower Decks?  Opinions?

[17:43:19] <amigojapan> Roey: I wave to watch it
[17:44:38] <amigojapan> Berlin36: the time stamp is disablable I think. But not sure about the command
[17:45:36] <Berlin36> yeah, im gonna try and sisble it
[17:46:01] <Roey> aye
[17:46:44] <amigojapan> Roey: that's a comedy right?
[17:47:57] <Roey> correct.
[17:48:07] <Roey> a comedy with a Star Trek theme-pack bolted on
[17:50:34] <amigojapan> Roey: id like to see it
[17:52:21] <DunceCotus> i've heard its okay but not that funny
[17:53:42] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: that is a big problem for a comedy
[17:54:03] <DunceCotus> sci-fi and comedy rarely work
[17:54:20] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: red dwarf was great
[17:54:21] <DunceCotus> except in some cases like (early) Red Dwarf, Galaxy Quest
[17:54:31] <amigojapan> Right
[17:54:35] <DunceCotus> amigojapan early red dwarf yeah
[17:54:56] <DunceCotus> the latest season I couldn't bring myself to watch
[17:54:59] <amigojapan> Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
[17:55:03] <Bco1981> The Orville ?
[17:55:04] <DunceCotus> they're just too old
[17:55:11] <Roey> that was fun in a more intellilgent way, HHGttG
[17:55:14] <DunceCotus> amigojapan also good, but kinda faux-scifi
[17:55:44] <DunceCotus> Bco1981 it was alright, but suffers from MacFarlaneisms
[17:55:45] <amigojapan> What is faux DunceCotus ?
[17:55:55] <DunceCotus> false
[17:56:26] <DunceCotus> amigojapan like HHGttG uses its sci-fi elements purely for comedy
[17:56:33] <DunceCotus> it doesn't really use it to create a cohesive world
[17:56:52] <DunceCotus> Red Dwarf however has a quite serious scifi world
[17:56:55] <DunceCotus> but comedy within that world
[17:57:03] <amigojapan> I see
[17:57:26] <DunceCotus> the last HHGttG book "Mostly Harmless" however was very dark for a comedy
[17:57:43] <DunceCotus> I remember being quite surprised by its change in tone

[17:58:09] <amigojapan> I did not read that one
[18:00:23] <DunceCotus> Futurama is another good sci-fi comedy
[18:00:30] <DunceCotus> but that's again more using sci-fi elements for comedy
[18:00:37] <DunceCotus> like HHGttG
[18:00:57] <DunceCotus> Rick & Morty is another one, similar thing
[18:01:05] <DunceCotus> flippant in its sci-fi, used for comedy
[18:01:39] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: but those are all good shows. I don't know what exactly you want
[18:02:50] <DunceCotus> im not complaining
[18:03:02] <DunceCotus> just saying that sci-fi and comedy don't mix organically
[18:03:11] <DunceCotus> you kinda need to make it into parody to make it work
[18:03:29] <amigojapan> I see
[18:03:52] <Sxem> humans are not all identical robots that only like 1 kind of sci fi comedy
[18:04:19] <DunceCotus> with comedy one problem is relatability 
[18:04:50] <DunceCotus> with sci-fi you are playing with futurity and concepts outside everyday modern life 
[18:05:00] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I had a pretty good Rick and Morty dream. And I wrote it down. Wanna read it?
[18:05:02] <DunceCotus> comedy of the future is not comedy of today
[18:05:23] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I think you showed me it
[18:05:29] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[18:05:40] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I even dream analysed it
[18:05:59] <amigojapan> Sorry. Very bad memory here DunceCotus 
[18:06:05] <DunceCotus> its alright
[18:06:11] <amigojapan> Thanks

[18:26:02] <amigojapan> Matt|home: since going postal seems related to your essay
[18:26:08] <Roey> Matt|home: wow
[18:26:27] <Matt|home> oh no DunceCotus it's american government, this question was discussing the shift from the spoils system to the merit system under garfield and his assassination

[18:26:45] <Roey> :P heh
[18:27:04] <Matt|home> it's just a joke persona because otherwise my essays are dry and hard to read

[18:27:10] <Matt|home> american government
[18:27:12] <Roey> Matt|home: ahhhh
[18:27:37] <Matt|home> this chapter is on bureacracy :D as you can imagine
[18:27:40] <Matt|home> it's not particularly thrilling
[18:27:42] <Roey> Matt|home: how's the class, does the curriculum try and stamp leftism onto you?
[18:28:29] <Matt|home> nah it's mostly read at your own leisure and here are the takehome tests. this is the final, the class is over after today. unfortunately we didn't focus on the topics i was really interested in, which is constitutional government (im not going to law school i just like the subject)
[18:28:38] <Matt|home> but we spent very little time on the chapters that cover that
[18:28:46] <Roey> Matt|home: ahhh
[18:29:02] <Roey> Matt|home: well good luck with this!
[18:29:04] <Matt|home> mostly introductory stuff, here's the party system here's the branches etc

[18:29:50] <DunceCotus> that's one thing you don't really see in animes.. homosexuality
[18:30:12] <Roey> well female homosexuality yeah lots
[18:30:20] <Roey> and homosexuality in the form of yaoi sure
[18:30:35] <Roey> DunceCotus: unless you mean something lese?
[18:30:36] <DunceCotus> yaoi is quite niche
[18:30:37] <Roey> *else?

[18:31:20] <tastythings> they say it's a hot climate
[18:31:30] <Roey> also Jews are underrepresented in naime
[18:31:31] <Roey> anime
[18:31:33] <DunceCotus> hot button climate
[18:31:35] <Roey> aside from tropes here and there
[18:31:50] <DunceCotus> Roey even japanese is underrepresented in anime
[18:31:58] <tastythings> it's just fine that they are underrepresented
[18:32:01] <DunceCotus> I mean it all takes place in japan but main characters are all westernised
[18:32:23] <Roey> tastythings: why? Christianity is very front and center in anime
[18:32:25] <Roey> why not Judaism?
[18:32:28] <tastythings> since they are equally underrepresented in real life in japan
[18:32:29] <DunceCotus> that's perhaps one reason its so odd when they adapt animes to film
[18:32:34] <DunceCotus> and the characters now look japanese
[18:32:35] <DunceCotus> xD
[18:32:38] <Roey> tastythings: or do you mean about Japanese people?
[18:32:53] <Roey> in anime from what I understand it's a stylized approximation of Western culture
[18:32:55] <tastythings> I mean japanese people, yes
[18:32:58] <Roey> ahh
[18:33:08] <Roey> tastythings: but what about all the anmes with Japaense names and locations?
[18:33:18] <DunceCotus> Christianity as front and center of anime? Not sure about that

[18:35:12] <tastythings> anime is for the most part not about the west

[18:54:41] <tastythings> I do hope it changes a bit because I don't think I can eat 97 episodes of the same thing

[20:34:51] <Jigsy> Hah.
[20:35:02] <DunceCotus> Jigsy latin is useful
[20:35:10] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, you're clearly a man of culture and experience. You understand the difference between 2d and 3d very well and for this, you have my respect
[20:35:14] <Jigsy> It's a dead language only used in scientific circles.
[20:35:18] <DunceCotus> for reeling in the latinos
[20:35:27] <Jigsy> And even then, who the fuck calls things by their Latin names?
[20:35:46] <DunceCotus> scientists who are trying to sound smart
[20:35:48] <Berlin36> some latin words are very familiar to me
[20:35:55] <Berlin36> as i speak Romanian
[20:36:03] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Mahouka Koukou no Yuutousei | Episode: 5
[20:36:03] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Kageki Shoujo!! | Episode: 5
[20:36:22] <Berlin36> ngl, latin sounds epic
[20:36:30] <Sxem> english has a lot of rare words based on latin, so it helps figure out the meaning without using a dictionary
[20:36:35] <Berlin36> it's like you're trying to summon godzilla
[20:36:43] <Jigsy> If you're going to learn a language, at least learn a useful language.
[20:36:54] <Cryowolf> Latin is incredibly useful, it's used to name things quite often and you find a lot of different languages closely related to Latin across southern and central Europe during the ancient reign of the Republic of Rome and Empire of Rome. To learn about history, Latin is a very good tool
[20:36:56] <Jigsy> Like 日本語.
[20:37:13] <TsundereNoises> Latin's useful if you really like reading stuff from roman times
[20:37:14] <Berlin36> it says big boobs?
[20:37:22] <TsundereNoises> or want to use magic
[20:37:29] <Cryowolf> Latin isn't very useful if you're a lumberjack
[20:37:31] <Cryowolf> but still
[20:37:33] <Jigsy> Half the stuff they teach in school is stuff people could learn in their own time.
[20:37:37] <Cryowolf> TsundereNoises, I use magic all the time
[20:37:53] <Jigsy> I left school 18 years ago, and I've never once applied any knowledge of Shakespeare to a real world situation.
[20:37:54] <isekaijin> Is Japanese going to video games what Latin once was for science?
[20:38:11] <isekaijin> going to be* for* video games
[20:38:14] <Cryowolf> no Japanese devs are adapting to the western market quite a lot
[20:38:17] <Jigsy> I'm not very good at learning Japanese, though. :<
[20:38:17] <Cryowolf> which sucks
[20:38:24] <Cryowolf> because I want old school JRPGs
[20:38:30] <Cryowolf> anyway, off to the store
[20:38:33] <Sxem> latin was a proto-esperanto
[20:38:38] <TsundereNoises> more seriously, I'm opposed to the approach of arguing that it's bad to teach something in schools based on it's practical usefulness, because I've seen that argument used against literally everything, and I've ended up needing lots of random things I was taught that I didn't think I would
[20:38:48] <TsundereNoises> and also that we should let kids keep their options open
[20:38:57] <isekaijin> Sxem: Latin did not have to be purposefully kept alive.
[20:38:59] <TsundereNoises> I don't really give a shit if they teach Latin or not, sure it isn't the most useful language
[20:39:17] <Jigsy> I had a choice of Latin or French as a second language in school.
[20:39:19] <TsundereNoises> but the PHILOSOPHY of "let's not teach this because I personally don't feel it's useful" is kind of a gross approach
[20:39:21] <Jigsy> I chose French.
[20:39:26] <Sxem> i took latin at my catholic grade school
[20:39:39] <DunceCotus> its good to leanr useless stuff too
[20:39:46] <DunceCotus> cause you don't know what's gonna be useful ultimately
[20:39:56] <Jigsy> I don't know...
[20:39:59] <TsundereNoises> Yeah, I could have taken Latin, French, or Spanish, I took French
[20:40:00] <Sxem> i kept scoring 100 but they said only god is perfect and gave me 99s instead
[20:40:03] <Jigsy> ...the time they spend teaching useless crap...
[20:40:05] <TsundereNoises> but that's not a reason to not offer Latin
[20:40:08] <Jigsy> ...could be spend teaching useful stuff.
[20:40:13] <Jigsy> time spent*
[20:40:17] <DunceCotus> Jigsy like what?
[20:40:19] <TsundereNoises> and really, I chose Japanese

[20:41:40] <TsundereNoises> yes but there's also lots of "unimportant" things I learned in school that have been helpful in some way in my life at one point or another
[20:41:56] <Jigsy> I've honestly learnt more from the Internet than I did in school.

[20:42:32] <isekaijin> Jigsy: You do not need to know MATH to do your taxes, though. Just basic elementary school arithmetic.
[20:42:34] <DunceCotus> end of the day it is useful to whom, to do what?
[20:42:41] <DunceCotus> useful often has ideological connotations
[20:42:46] <Jigsy> [17:12:32] <isekaijin> Jigsy: You do not need to know MATH to do your taxes,
[20:42:49] <Jigsy> I never said you did.
[20:43:09] <TsundereNoises> the biggest problem is how many people just can't think and don't really know how ANYTHING works
[20:43:15] <DunceCotus> MATH tax
[20:43:27] <Jigsy> How's this then.
[20:43:28] <TsundereNoises> and some of that is solved by just having some amount of things they've had to think about more, whatever they are
[20:43:34] <Jigsy> Make all the useful crap extracirrcular.

[23:07:55] <Omega037> I mean, we are all vaccinated, doesn't seem to have prevented transmission
[23:08:02] <Omega037> That is probably thanks to Delta
[23:08:21] <Omega037> As for getting sick, my son has had the flu, strep, etc a few times
[23:08:33] <Omega037> So unless it gets really bad, he just needs sleep and fluids

[23:26:14] <isekaijin> Nanobot: Where does ImoutoBot fetch information from about new episodes?
[23:28:53] <Nanobot> isekaijin: nyaa. It compares the torrent title with the titles in anidb and uses heuristics using the series premier date and episode numbers to try to guess which anidb entry the torrent corresponds to, and then pull information from that. It uses a local copy of anidb on my computer (which also powers !a and other stuff)
