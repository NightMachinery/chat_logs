[02:40:10] <havenwood> A joke, but it *almost* works to do: @values[selector.object_id / 2]
[02:40:45] <havenwood> Pesky `true` would be `10` not `1` these days.
[02:42:08] <aesthetikx> havenwood, what is @values and what is selector?

[02:44:39] <weaksauce> reference to that i assume
[02:46:54] <havenwood> aesthetikx: yeah, I meant the gist ^
[02:47:50] <havenwood> I hash to prod constant is tempting. Is `nil` also a `0` key is a question too?
[02:47:56] <havenwood> to proc*
[02:48:41] <havenwood> I don’t like ternary, cross-class keys.
[03:12:16] <aesthetikx> i never came across an actual use case for Hash#to_proc, care to demonstrate?
[03:12:30] <aesthetikx> or do you mean a hash with proc values

[06:25:12] <StayHungry> Good morning, comrades
[06:25:43] <StayHungry> I'm exploring syntax and possibilities of various scripting languages related to the following task:
[06:26:04] <StayHungry> Swap 24-07-2021 into 2021-07-24
[06:26:42] <StayHungry> Ruby is the last one on my list after Lua, Perl, Python, Powershell, NodeJS, and AWK
[06:27:09] <StayHungry> I wonder how would you do that in the shortest possible way, basically a one-liner to execute from command line
[06:31:30] *** Quits: graywolf (~wolf@user/graywolf) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[06:32:48] <weaksauce> could just do a basic split on -
[06:32:52] <weaksauce> then swap it 
[06:33:06] <weaksauce> assuming the data is normalized 
[06:33:56] <StayHungry> yep, seems only 2 ways exist to approach this
[06:34:07] <StayHungry> either split,reverse,join
[06:34:17] <StayHungry> or capture groups then reorder
[06:34:44] <weaksauce> yeah
[06:35:01] <StayHungry> except for limited lua, which helped with capture groups, rest of mentioned languages did it the first way
[06:35:17] <StayHungry> so i wonder the syntax of ruby here
[06:36:28] <nakilon> .split("-").reverse.join("-")
[06:36:50] <nakilon> you basically translate the task from English to Ruby word by word
[06:37:10] <weaksauce> > "07-2-2021" =~ /([0-9]{2})/; $1
[06:37:35] <weaksauce> but i'd do the more descriptive way 
[06:37:37] <StayHungry> by the way, if you're interested how other languages syntax looks here: https://dpaste.org/MgxA/slim
[06:37:41] <nakilon> .scan(/\d+/).reverse.join("-")
[06:38:19] <nakilon> I code in Ruby exactly because I know how other languages look
[06:39:01] <StayHungry> hmm, your code looks almost exactly as javascript's for nodejs :D
[06:39:38] <nakilon> because javascript likes ruby -- see coffe script
[06:39:51] <weaksauce> wasn't always that way
[06:40:02] <StayHungry> ruby.exe -e "print(('24-07-2021').split('-').reverse.join('-'))" is the shortes way here, right?
[06:40:19] <nakilon> you can use ?- instead of "-"
[06:40:19] <weaksauce> god why would someone want to program in python like that 
[06:40:20] <weaksauce> oof
[06:40:46] <weaksauce> sub puts for print 
[06:40:52] <weaksauce> gets you a lil shorter
[06:40:56] <StayHungry> weaksauce: you mean nested way instead of sequential? i'm shocked too :)
[06:41:25] <weaksauce> yeah "-".join is where you lost me 
[06:41:30] <StayHungry> +1
[06:41:36] <weaksauce> obfuscates the intent like mad
[06:41:49] <nakilon> [you in Python.to(supposed.(like(that)).write())]
[06:41:55] <StayHungry> :D
[06:41:57] <weaksauce> haha
[06:42:09] <nakilon> damn I even lost "are" somewhere
[06:42:18] <weaksauce> it blows my mind that the zeitgeist went the python way 
[06:42:24] <weaksauce> packaging sucks hard
[06:42:35] <weaksauce> the indentation thing is worse in all regards 
[06:42:37] <StayHungry> shortest was powershell's, most elegant seems to be awk, most clear is either js and ruby, rest are so-so
[06:43:08] <michigan> ruuuuuuby!
[06:43:34] <StayHungry> however, ruby.exe takes 350ms to launch :( maybe there is a way to accelerate it?
[06:43:37] <michigan> is so frekin gorgeous like a modernized and simplfied alternative to python
[06:44:02] <weaksauce> cruby probably StayHungry 
[06:44:56] <weaksauce> i mean i just did a small ruby oneliner and it was no time at all really 
[06:44:59] <nakilon> also there is some flag to "not load bundled gems", see --help
[06:45:30] <weaksauce> but if you want initial startup time to be real low don't use ruby
[06:45:42] <weaksauce> probably python too 
[06:46:27] <weaksauce> and if you are calling a ruby script often it's probably at the wrong level of abstraction 
[06:47:04] <nakilon> what is Zeitgeist ? wikipedia says it's now in Vala, not Pithon
[06:49:26] <StayHungry> ruby --disable=gems -e "puts(('24-07-2021').split('-').reverse.join('-'))" -> 50 ms, hooray
[06:50:52] <StayHungry> cruby is something not bundled here, it's kind of abandonware right now, or not?
[07:04:25] <StayHungry> no, perhaps you meant chruby which seems not to be available for Windows
[07:10:36] <StayHungry> nonetheless, thank you for warm welcome and help in-depth, comrades
