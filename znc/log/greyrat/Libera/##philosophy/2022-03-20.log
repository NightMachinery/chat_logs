[18:14:23] <arryana> at least, 25 years ago that was true
[18:14:32] <Ungwelian> The entire Earth doesn't embrace Christianity. There are thousands, if not tens of thousands of religions.
[18:15:00] <amigojapan> Ungwelian:there was a time when assan's pOV was the mainstream, but that is a very long time ago, how are we regressing like this?
[18:15:02] <Ungwelian> Many, many religions involving millions of people.

[18:19:35] <assan> see mrdata, you claim polaris is what you observe but how does your observation of polaris proove the earth being round?
[18:19:38] <Ungwelian> And in addition to secularization, a lot of people live in bad conditions and drudgery, and _need_ what conspiracy theories offer.

[18:20:35] <arryana> i can't wait for the next cloudy day so i can prune some of the hedges
[18:20:36] <Ungwelian> It's far more interesting to think e.g. that the Earth is flat, than to agree with the mainstream round view. Like, if it's flat, what else has been hidden from knowledge?
[18:20:43] <Ungwelian> Suddenly all kinds of theories open up.
[18:20:48] <arryana> this vampire thing has its drawbacks
[18:21:01] <Ungwelian> And you get into this magical, enchanted reality, with good and evil hidden forces.

[19:00:49] <amigojapan> he is iryith
[19:01:18] <iryith> that is fairly easily disproven with P and S wave transfer through the planet and the associated shadow zones
[19:01:31] <assan> amigojapan don't worry, you know the truth and am not that wise, so let's leave it at that
[19:02:21] <iryith> assan, do you have a refutation to the P and S wave transfers?
[19:02:25] <assan> i wish you good with your endeavors amigojapan, i hope those your computer programs make good waves someday
[19:02:57] <amigojapan> Ok thanks assan
[19:03:04] <assan> iryith what are P and S wave transfers
[19:03:26] <assan> sure you welcome amigojapan
[19:03:51] <pussipupu> I can't tell if the strange grammar is deliberate
[19:03:52] <iryith> So when you have an earthquake, you get a variety of waves, the main ones being P and S waves, (pressure and shear respectively). So say an earthquake happens on one side of the planet, you're going to get transfer of those waves through the planet
[19:04:28] <pussipupu> iryith: also maritime charts wouldn't work if the surface wasn't curved
[19:04:31] <iryith> and the shadow zones are really neat, because P and S waves transfer their energy in different ways, they also interact with different phases of matter differently, so P waves are good at going through solids but not so much through 'liquids'
[19:04:47] <assan> iryith earthquakes never happen here where i am
[19:04:48] <pussipupu> lots of things just don't fit with disc earth
[19:04:57] <iryith> these waves, the timing, and the placement of them can tell you the interior structure of the earth

[19:38:46] <I_Am_M00t> flat earthers aren't pilots i assume, and even if some are, as long as they follow instructions i couldn't give two damns
[19:39:18] <biys> flat earth belief is a result of mistrust in the establishment/institutions/government

[19:39:29] <biys> you can't view it from the same lens  you're viewing it
[19:39:51] <biys> consider it a matter of not really believing anything you've been told by those who claim ``authority''
[19:40:28] <biys> i mean...  we can all point at times the government has acted shady or lied to further some agenda coined as being for the greater good
[19:40:44] <biys> we can see where health institutions have done experiments on people without them knowing
[19:41:02] <biys> we can see times when the government hasn't acted int he best interest of its population at all

[19:42:06] <biys> their acceptance of ideas outside the norm is just an indication of the level of mistrust they have towards the system
[19:42:10] <biys> it makes perfect sense really
[19:43:03] <mrdata> i have a lot of mistrust towards the system
[19:43:28] <mrdata> but from first principles and my own observation, i know which models check out

[19:44:26] <mrdata> my father was a sailor
[19:44:27] <biys> the position is something like..  imagine if the underpinning associated with your understanding is flawed at it's deepest roots

[20:50:01] <mrdata> on my map, lagos to tokyo goes north-east, flying over russia; frustratingly, these days, we should avoid flying over russia

[20:56:05] <mrdata> if you are going to put a satellite in orbit, it helps to know where to put it
[20:56:16] <mrdata> so, shape of the earth kind of comes up, there
[20:56:24] <assan> Delf it's more like a sun map, i mapped the earth using the different times the sun meets particular lands
[20:57:02] <assan> it's all condensed and not like fully detailed but before i exit the earth am gonna pen something more detailed
[20:58:02] <mrdata> assan, so what direction must i go to get to japan, fastest?
[20:58:07] <assan> and mrdata let nato and the world military allow people go check out that Antarctica let's be sure there's no edge cuz last i checked those far places are government only
[20:58:09] <arryana> that's one of the things id on't regret about my youth. i hiked the appalachian trail, half the pacific crest trail, and walked across new mexico

[21:10:07] <Delf> I have noticed my brainballs getting into defense mode when I use belief, it tries to protect what I believe

[21:12:47] <Delf> No
[21:12:51] <Delf> Getting into defense mode
[21:13:12] <assan> because you try to defend the truth?
[21:13:41] <Delf> I don't try to defend the truth, my brainballs is compelled to
[21:14:14] <assan> the bible would say money is a protection like knowledge is, but the difference is that knowledge preserves he that posses her
[21:15:02] <assan> also the bible would go ahead and say knowledge is good for she that poses it, meaning if what you have is truth it would be evident in your life quality
[21:15:40] <assan> the idea is not to go debating with mister data, truth improves your mind in itself
[21:17:09] <Delf> Truth is too religious of a thing for me
[21:17:20] <assan> well not really
[21:17:33] <assan> sometimes truth is agreeing you don't know
[21:17:46] <assan> better to say i don't know than assume
[21:18:35] <assan> call out all topics in existence and take your stand
[21:18:40] <Delf> I value honesty deeply, contrary to truth

[21:19:15] <assan> well you probably have a prejudice towards the word truth
[21:19:17] <Delf> At some point, you will be forced to decide which you want to value. You cannot have both :)
[21:19:49] <assan> i would say honesty is more like a tool to approach the truth

[22:27:07] <mycroftiv> and so believing we now had the mathematical power to merge reality and videogames and reshape our physical bodies like videogame skins, i said a lot of totally insane things to people that are rather offensive
