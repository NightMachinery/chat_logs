[03:47:21] <lz_> https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/
[03:47:29] <Nasp> Yeah except it doesn't work for stack deploy which we use it seems
[03:47:59] <Nasp> Now i'm trying to just bake it into the image but no dice so far
[03:48:06] <lz_> you said earlier you were using "compose up" but nvm
[03:48:36] <Nasp> Yeah i thought so but seems like we werent
[03:48:43] <Nasp> We have our own tooling on top of docker
[03:49:34] <lz_> so i kept googling and https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-stack-deploy-with-context-and-env-variables/96152

[03:51:33] <Nasp> Which part?
[03:51:37] <Nasp> It says it's not supported as well
[03:51:51] <lz_> they mention a workaround
[03:52:02] <bomb> nobody gives shit about the Ukrainian-Russian war anymore
[03:58:47] <bpmedley> dpuerto : When you say "build number" are you using SQL Server and want the specific version?  Something like "select @@version"?
[03:58:48] <Nasp> lz_:  Seems like i just keep losing because some of the tool chain supports it and others not
[03:59:03] <Nasp> I think i will just try and add it to the compose files and do a search and replace tomorr
[04:00:33] <bpmedley> Another possibility: You may also use the --build-arg flag without a value, in which case the value from the local environment will be propagated into the Docker container being built: "docker build --build-arg HTTP_PROXY ."
[04:01:28] <Nasp> Yup i tried that as one of the first things
[04:01:57] <bpmedley> What does --build-arg do, Nasp ?  Anything?
[04:02:08] <Nasp> nothing
[04:02:33] <Nasp> I have a possible solution no

[04:02:54] <Nasp> Which was what i was kinda trying to avoid
[04:03:18] <bpmedley> Are they easy edits?
[04:03:31] <Nasp> I may be able to do a search and replace on existing lines
[04:03:42] <bpmedley> Can you use perl and do the replace programmatically?
[04:04:09] <Nasp> search and replace build -> args: with build -> args -> my new entry
[04:04:11] <Nasp> And then a new line
[04:04:20] <bpmedley> Cool, hope it works
[04:04:30] <Nasp> Yeah i really dont want to edit all those files
[04:04:37] <Nasp> I've said for years we should simplify it
[04:05:53] <DoofusCanadensis> should and having-the-time-to-actually-simplify are often two very different things

[11:45:26] <PeterR``> how do you then know when to stop waiting for more items?
[11:45:39] <PeterR``> (there are many identical consumers)
[11:46:28] <PeterR``> with one producers it's easy: you just called CompleteAdding and the consumers will all drop out of a for loop which uses GetConsumingEnumerable

[15:26:29] <canton7> smallville7123, and just use BitOperations.PopCount, no need to inject your own
[15:26:33] <canton7> *to invent your own
[15:27:20] <ern> ASUS: When you do something async, like, connect to some resource outside of your application, such as a database or API, doing it "async" will let the application "free up" cpu cycles to do someting else in the mean time
[15:27:31] <JakeSays> canton7: didn't he just re-implement the shift operators?
[15:27:50] <ern> when you do await somethingAsync() it will wait until this operation is done, otherwise you can do something else in the mean time
[15:28:18] <Suchiman> ern: not necessarily CPU cycles but threads which have memory and scheduling overhead to keep around
[15:28:20] <canton7> JakeSays, ish? >>> is an unsigned shift in Java: C# just uses >> with an unsigned operand
[15:28:38] <ern> Basically, you can start several async operations, like api1, api2, api3 and they can run in parallell
[15:28:45] <canton7> But Java doesn't know about unsigned numbers, so you need a different operator

[23:11:14] <DoofusCanadensis> we'll sell you office solutions that you walked through in our VR Lab before anything was even built
[23:11:23] <DoofusCanadensis> nah, custom built for now
[23:11:26] <redoc> DoofusCanadensis: pretty cool
[23:11:56] <DoofusCanadensis> we have some former Nintendo devs working on the 3D and VR parts of the system
[23:11:57] <bomb> yeah, you're smart enough to quit gamedev, and build a software company using your gamedev experience :)
[23:12:29] <DoofusCanadensis> the early motto for ice edge was "merging construction with gaming"
[23:12:46] <bomb> so, who are your customers, if I might to ask? what kind of companies use VR other than game studios?
[23:13:52] <DoofusCanadensis> the manufacturing company is our main customer... we manufacture reconfigurable and environment friendly office solutions and use the VR to show you how configurable before anything is built
[23:13:54] <redoc> companies that build track homes

[23:21:15] <JakeSays> bomb: that's not something one brags about :p
[23:21:56] <bomb> shut it JakeSays they use Swing because it's a battle-hardened industry-strength application platform choose by Fortune 500 companies.
[23:22:09] <jonp> it is?
[23:22:18] <DoofusCanadensis> hehe

[23:24:07] <DoofusCanadensis> given that our app originally only supported Windows (the new stuff is all Unity on mobile so...), Java was an odd choice
[23:24:08] <bomb> it's awesome. C# doesn't have anything comparable to Swing yet
[23:24:16] <jonp> WPF?
[23:24:18] <JakeSays> bomb: that's because c# is a language
[23:24:19] <DoofusCanadensis> except that James Gosling was on the original Board of Directors
[23:24:27] <bomb> WPF is Windows only
[23:25:18] <bomb> a fair share of CG industry runs on Linux. that's why Houdini, etc. supports Linux
