[09:37:27] <jmcantrell> I was testing some color scheme stuff with a page and had `<meta name="color-scheme" content="dark light">` set. In firefox, this shows form elements with dark backgrounds, but in qutebrowser, they're still the default white. What controls that?
[09:45:10] *** Joins: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge)
[09:45:23] <bedlam> There's a program called qt5-ct which can set qt5 themes.
[09:46:27] <bedlam> I can't say if it controls form elements though.  I would think there's some CSS for that.
[09:53:55] <jmcantrell> I’m using that and I have it set on a dark theme but I’ll double check it.
[10:27:14] <jmcantrell> Is there a way to configure default css?
[10:32:07] <bedlam> IIRC you can load or reload a css file.
[10:32:53] <bedlam> I haven't done it for a few years and some versions ago though, so there are probably changes.

[11:41:54] <jmcantrell> bedlam: thanks. That gets me a step closer
[11:43:39] <bedlam> You should be able to edit it on the fly, and when you've saved it run the :set command in QB's CLI.
[11:44:15] <bedlam> I had an alias to open it in gvim, and another to :set it afterwards.
[11:44:37] <bedlam> It makes it much easier/faster to see the effects.
[11:46:38] <jmcantrell> Do you mind sharing your css?
[11:47:08] <bedlam> I don't think I have it any more, or if I do it's years out of date.
[11:47:36] <jmcantrell> I wonder why that setting allows for a list of files. First one that exists wins?
[11:47:46] <jmcantrell> Ok no problem
[11:47:55] <bedlam> Not a clue.  I only ever used one.
[11:48:24] <bedlam> I guess you could have a list with each one style per website?
[11:48:30] <bedlam> styled*
[11:49:21] <jmcantrell> How would qb select the css for a particular site?
[11:49:54] <The-Compiler> jmcantrell, bedlam: You can set it to multiple files to combine them, e.g. if you use https://github.com/alphapapa/solarized-everything-css/ and don't want to edit it, yet want to add your own customizations
[11:50:31] <jmcantrell> Ooh that looks promising
[11:52:32] <jmcantrell> I’m guessing there isn’t a way to apply css per site?
[11:55:05] <The-Compiler> nope
[11:55:22] <The-Compiler> there's an old PR open for that, but it had various issues and never was really finished
[11:56:16] <The-Compiler> to get per-site CSS with proper applying of the styles (not just when the page finished loading), IIRC we'd need to reimplement the whole URL pattern matching logic in JS :-/
[12:00:57] <jmcantrell> The solarized style sheet helps, but there’s still some quirks with a lot of sites. I guess that’s to be expected.

[20:34:05] <donoban> it seems thats ctrl+shift+t it's already a bind to :undo
