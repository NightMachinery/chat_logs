[00:42:01] <diana> Hello

[00:42:33] <diana> I have a string like "lib64samplerate0-0.2.2-1.mga9"
[00:43:05] <diana> and i need to get everything until number plus - 
[00:45:13] <karhunkynsi> So, 'lib64samplerate' then?
[00:46:24] <diana> lib64samplerate0
[00:46:31] <diana> including the number
[00:47:17] <karhunkynsi> Ok, how about remove first - and everything after?
[00:47:26] <diana> not quite
[00:47:47] <diana> because in some string i have a minus  and than a number and a minus
[00:49:37] <karhunkynsi> Have a couple more examples of input and desired output?

[01:00:57] <diana> sed ..... | urpmi --downgrade -
[01:01:01] <diana> that's what i tried
[01:01:45] <yitz> How's urpmi expect that data?
[01:02:05] <diana> usually i just go with urpmi --downgrade git-prompt
[01:02:24] <yitz> cmd | while read -r ; do echo cmd "$REPLY"; done
[01:02:34] <yitz> Assuming urpmi doesn't expect STDIN
[01:03:02] <diana> hmmmm
[01:03:08] <diana> cmd being the sed thing?
[01:03:14] <yitz> Sure
[01:03:20] <diana> so something like
[01:04:13] <diana> rpm -qa|grep mga9|sed 's/-[0-9]\{1,\}\..*//'| while read -r ; do echo `rpm -qa|grep mga9|sed 's/-[0-9]\{1,\}\..*//'|` "$REPLAY" ; done
[01:04:31] <yitz> No backticks
[01:04:35] <yitz> REPLY not REPLAY
[01:04:54] <yitz> And ... one cmd should be sed, the other urpmi
[01:06:01] <diana>  rpm -qa|grep mga9|sed 's/-[0-9]\{1,\}\..*//' while read -r ; do echo urpmi --downgrade "$REPLY"; done
[01:06:16] <yitz> Yeah
[01:06:22] <yitz> Looks roughly about right
[01:06:52] <yitz> If urpmi accepts multiple packages(?) and there's never going to be spaces in the package name, you can also just use a command substitution
[01:07:18] <yitz> Though #bash and shellcheck will complain about word splitting
[01:07:42] <yitz> echo urpmi --downgrade $( rmp ... | grep .. | sed .. )

[02:08:35] <OnlineCop> devForBot: `[^\n\d]*(\d)` looks for "anything except a digit/newline" followed by a digit, and capture the digit. But `(?:[^\n\d]*(\d))?` makes all of that optional (it can match 0 or 1 time).
[02:09:10] <OnlineCop> If you have `(?:[^\n\d]*(\d))?(?:[^\n\d]*(\d))?` at the end, it can match 8  OR  9  OR  10 digits, instead of "exactly 10".
[02:09:52] <OnlineCop> To match exactly 10 digits, you don't want `(?: ... )?` around those last 2.
[02:10:03] <devForBot> yes correct I was doing the tests but it is not working for me

[02:12:00] <devForBot> I am doing it in dialogflow which is google's AI for the Chatbot theme and I am trying to make an entity with a regular expression to do the validation.
[02:12:30] <devForBot> But the language I almost always use is Node.js JS.
[02:12:47] <OnlineCop> So maybe ECMAScript/Javascript?
[02:13:31] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/0SaKVj/7/codegen?language=javascript
[02:13:34] <devForBot> yes, that's right
[02:15:25] <devForBot> it's not really working for me at all
[02:15:56] <devForBot> It seems that dialogflow does not support such a big expression or I don't know.
[02:16:06] *** Quits: netpipe (~netpipe@user/netpipe) (Quit: Client closed)
[02:17:37] <OnlineCop> Does it match nothing?
[02:18:08] <devForBot> no, it is returning empty variable
[02:18:34] <OnlineCop> What does this return: [^\n\d]*(\d)[^\n\d]*
[02:18:35] <devForBot> that is, the parameter declared as an entity to validate
[02:19:27] <OnlineCop> I'm looking at https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/entities-regexp and they appear to be fairly similar to what we're using on the regex101 regex.
[02:20:08] <OnlineCop> Sometimes, the substitution should be  \1\2\3 ... \10  instead of  $1$2$3 ... $10
[02:20:21] <devForBot> Yes, that's just what I was checking
[02:21:36] <devForBot> but I'm not using it as you say with the $ symbol.
[02:22:31] <OnlineCop> If you want to remove everything EXCEPT digits, you can use   \D+
[02:22:39] <OnlineCop> https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax says it should support it.
[02:23:09] <OnlineCop> The problem is that it will remove characters around ANY number of digits, not just 10 digits.

[03:24:08] <quickEngineQuest> yo yo
[03:24:26] <quickEngineQuest> quick question about the different RegEx engines
[03:27:00] <yitz> quickEngineQuest: the other one is better
[03:27:24] <quickEngineQuest> Golang/Java 8 RegEx, do they have any significant differences from PCRE/Python? -- and does ECMAScript get used anywhere but within JS? (in which case... when xD I'd expect to have noticed it being used somewhere throughout my years working in webhosting)
[03:27:38] <quickEngineQuest> anywhere but in*
[03:28:18] <quickEngineQuest> okay, that second part of the question was too impulsively phrased xD
[03:28:50] <quickEngineQuest> only the first part's relevant for my current activity:p
[03:29:48] <quickEngineQuest> oh, I notice some major differences in Java RegEx right away - but that's manageable
[03:31:12] <OnlineCop> quickEngineQuest: .NET and Javascript support variable-width lookbehinds. Java has some support for variable-width lookbehinds, but functions a bit differently.
[03:31:46] <OnlineCop> PCRE doesn't support variable-width lookbehinds, so instead allows \K to do a forward match, and then "forget" the text before it.
[03:32:52] <quickEngineQuest> "PCRE doesn't support variable-width lookbehinds, so instead allows \K to do a forward match, and then "forget" the text before it"  gg... I thought I knew everything about PCRE, but this workaround could've helped me out many times
[03:33:08] <OnlineCop> Most of the flavors are adopting Unicode support, although they can differ slightly in how they are implemented. The most common notation is \p{...} where '...' will be the name or subset of whatever specific Unicode point you want to work with.
[03:33:27] <OnlineCop> Javascript doesn't support atomics, although there's a way to cheat.
[03:33:56] <OnlineCop> You can use a capture group inside a lookahead, and then outside of the lookeahead, use a backreference to them match what you had just captured: (?=.*(something))\1
[03:34:56] <OnlineCop> PCRE allows recursion; none of the others do. However, .NET does have one nice feature to make up for that: repeating a captured group will push new values onto the stack, instead of PCRE's method of just overwriting/clobbering what was there beore.
[03:34:58] <OnlineCop> *before
[03:35:27] <OnlineCop> You can then selectively POP values off of the .NET stack as you encounter other characters, effectively allowing you to do things like "brace matching".
[03:35:36] <quickEngineQuest> the JavaScript one's not really relevant, but had me surprised as it never caught my eye in customers'  scripts - Golang & Java may be come into play later
[03:35:46] <quickEngineQuest> Golang's bascially Python, from what I can see
[03:35:52] <quickEngineQuest> just minor differences
[03:35:59] <quickEngineQuest> Java however...
[03:36:03] <quickEngineQuest> scurs me
[03:36:23] <OnlineCop> There's an XRegexp package for Javascript to extend it with PCRE features. In Python, 're' is a built-in regex module, but the 'regex' module (from pypi) has most of the PCRE features.
[03:36:40] <OnlineCop> Yeah; Java wanted to be different.
[03:37:11] <quickEngineQuest> No no, Java was born different, but you're not supposed to talk about that. It may hurt its feelings
[03:37:25] <OnlineCop> Sadly, Golang is more 'RE2' than Python, so you have to look over its page of "PCRE notations" and then notice all the "(not supported)" next to many of them.
[03:37:37] <quickEngineQuest> both are 100% fine by me:p
[03:37:39] <OnlineCop> Yeah; we should be nice to Java. It's had a rough few weeks.
[03:39:09] <quickEngineQuest> I've mastered PHP&Python RegEx to where the senior sysadmin who's supposed to teach me, needs me to help him with complicated RegEx thingies
[03:39:10] <quickEngineQuest> :p
[03:40:03] <quickEngineQuest> the logic comes natural to me for whatever reason
[03:40:46] <quickEngineQuest> (me trying to use it for the first time when I was 12 may've had something to do with it, tho)
[03:41:11] <quickEngineQuest> back then it mostly confused & scared me
[03:43:18] <quickEngineQuest> anyway, back to work!
[03:43:19] <quickEngineQuest> thanks
[03:48:53] <OnlineCop> Maybe if you have time, you can explain to me when someone would use (*PRUNE). I use (*SKIP)(*F) all the time, but don't think I've ever encountered a time when (*PRUNE) was the go-to hammer.
[03:50:09] <Me-me> Did that lookahead problem ever get fixed?
[03:50:14] <Me-me> No, subroutine problem.

[03:58:46] <Me-me> Dang.
[03:59:48] <OnlineCop> TL;DR is that perl supports exactly that, but PCRE/PCRE2 were written in a way that it would be a significant change in order to put that into it.
[04:00:06] <OnlineCop> Plus, I'm about the only one who seems to have noticed it, so there aren't very many people screaming or yelling over that.
[04:00:34] <OnlineCop> Or maybe I just haven't created enough throw-away email accounts that "we" all want the same feature.

[17:50:43] <digitok> 07re101-cat-91, which programming language are you using
[17:54:42] <digitok> if it is pcre, https://regex101.com/r/HcHu6O/2, otherwise, https://regex101.com/r/HcHu6O/3 using group 1

[18:07:46] <re101-cat-91> if you have time i woulb be very thankful if you could help me with this one as well - https://regex101.com/r/mWlZ6k/1 i only want to get the text after the : or **

[18:08:04] <re101-cat-91> **Physiker:** Oh ja! Und wir können es jetzt auch demonstrieren! Kommt einfach mal mit!
[18:08:05] <re101-cat-91> only want to get

[18:29:24] <OnlineCop> re101-cat-91: PCRE?
[18:30:26] <re101-cat-91> python regex
[18:30:27] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/mWlZ6k/2
[18:30:31] *** Joins: nvmd (~nvmd@user/nvmd)
[18:31:52] <OnlineCop> This matches until it hits either ':' or '**'
[18:32:12] <OnlineCop> Then it expects ':' before '**'
[18:32:24] <re101-cat-91> how can i only get group 2 matches
[18:32:37] <OnlineCop> So if you need it to match line 1, where it's '**'...'**:' instead of '**'...':**' then you may need to modify that.
[18:32:58] <OnlineCop> If you don't want group 1, just remove the '(' and ')'.
[18:35:18] <re101-cat-91> which one of them, sry im not very good at it
[18:39:03] <OnlineCop> Change  ([^*:]*)  to just   [^*:]*
[18:39:44] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/mWlZ6k/3 would add MORE capture groups, but also allow "**name** (action): text" as well as "**name:** text"  :D
[18:40:49] <OnlineCop> Did you not want the **Name**?
