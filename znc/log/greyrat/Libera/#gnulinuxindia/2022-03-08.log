[07:50:03] <NeoVoid[m]> Using linux is not a big deal. Almost all DE provide intuitive interface these days.
[07:50:43] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> command line god
[07:51:06] <NeoVoid[m]> what will be thing of wonder is one figuring out cli without any outside guidance.
[07:51:15] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> yes
[07:51:23] <NeoVoid[m]> like just put them in tty jail
[07:51:28] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> XD
[07:51:43] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> they will just google how to install de on <insert distro>
[07:52:12] <NeoVoid[m]> well you can give them a only hint is about man pages
[07:52:23] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> yeah thats sounds ok
[07:53:34] <NeoVoid[m]> may be this can be goos example psychological experiment on non technical folks to test their problem solving or exploring abilities.
[07:53:55] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i did ok cuz i learned how to google :Skull:
[07:54:36] <NeoVoid[m]> that could be nice topic for doctorate.
[07:54:57] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> idk what that means
[07:56:12] <NeoVoid[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: you know those kids who could figure out where to find games in tv system in early days or in mobiles. 
[07:56:12] <NeoVoid[m]> those are the ones who dont taught how to use google.

[08:31:05] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> This is literally my linux experience
[08:31:44] <relejek[m]> Neo Void:  it is actually not that difficult for a luddite to get started if you through them into a tty jail. at least on the learning part. it will be boring but they can get started if you give them a logged in tty shell
[08:31:48] <NeoVoid[m]> I think its inbuilt function of conscience to figure things out. 
[08:31:49] <NeoVoid[m]> in the child period we are most likely in shape to harness it. but unfortunately we were wired not stretch this ability.
[08:32:28] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i was in tty mode for 2 days lol
[08:34:50] <relejek[m]> Ask you self, you know nothing, 
[08:34:50] <relejek[m]> what is the intuitive thing you would type in tty (terminal) that could give you something to learn and get going? and everyone knows it as it is culturally been taught to literate people
[08:35:09] <relejek[m]>  * Ask your self, when you know nothing, 
[08:35:09] <relejek[m]> what is the intuitive thing you would type in tty (terminal) that could give you something to learn and get going? and everyone knows it as it is culturally been taught to literate people
[08:36:44] <relejek[m]> s/through/throw/
[08:37:45] <smud[m]> help!
[08:39:03] <smud[m]> <ElJohnSepiol[m]> "i was in tty mode for 2 days lol" <- Its fun to use. The low input latency really grows on you
[08:40:16] <relejek[m]> smud[m]: exactly my guy. the most intuitive a Luddite could type in a terminal that gives them a learning start.
[08:58:15] <gtlsgamr> relejek[m]: smud[m]: Not sure if your use of the word "Luddite" is correct.
[08:58:36] <gtlsgamr> According to wikipedia the term "luddite" often is used to describe someone who is opposed or resistant to new technologies
[08:58:58] <gtlsgamr> interesting read --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite
[08:58:59] <NatuKaka> Title: Luddite - Wikipedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
[09:08:44] <relejek[m]> gtlsgamr:  i know the word and its origins. it started as way to insult a group of people (the factory workers) in industrial age by -well- 'industrialists'. yet now it is used for 'people who don't understand modern tech' or 'resist learning tech' or could be used in a sense for specific tech. e.g " i am a C-lang master but a 'BASIC' luddite, coz i don't want to learn it however easy may be."
[09:09:04] <gtlsgamr> ah!
[09:09:20] <gtlsgamr>  the term "luddite" often is used to describe someone who is opposed or resistant to new technologies <-- so this is an incomplete definition i guess
[09:09:29] <gtlsgamr> i didn't know what it meant hence i googled
[09:10:23] <relejek[m]> by the old definition, their could be no 'luddites' in modern era of tech. so, it has adorned a new cloak. now it is not an insult but jsut an identifier of kind of people, so as to understand their views.
[09:14:13] <relejek[m]> gtlsgamr: strictly my personal opinion coz we live in a multilingual society(country: India) "natural languages change and develop fast from months to a generation, so, does it's grammar and the dictionary" 
[09:14:13] <relejek[m]> heck i don't understand some Gen-Z slang and those guys are awesome and all that is canon now lmao.

[10:33:20] <NeoVoid[m]> its funny how he is saying this was about Ukrainian users specifically because last post which tells the same story didnt mentioned Ukrainian people being involved it was just about general userbase of telegram who lives in russia.

[10:38:27] <iamak[m]> dakship: I was thinking of forking the current LoS unofficial build and adding SE Linux. But reading about it gave me headache so not going to do that
[10:38:39] <iamak[m]> Also don't want to experiment on my only phone
[10:39:09] <dakship> Makes sense
[10:39:50] <iamak[m]> Is SE Linux essential?

[16:22:32] <glizzster[m]> all songs are there bro
[16:22:36] <glizzster[m]> most*
[16:22:46] <glizzster[m]> and like, you can just use an adblocker on spotify
[16:22:46] <dakship> i never ever found a song which wasnt on yt
[16:22:53] <dakship> which i can just get by ytdlp
[16:23:12] <dakship> glizzster[m]: with ytdlp there are no ads at all
[16:23:19] <dakship> and it isnt properitary
[16:23:20] <dakship> ofc
[16:23:21] <glizzster[m]> spotify is also convenient you know
[16:23:26] <glizzster[m]> dakship: yeah
[16:23:31] <glizzster[m]> that
[16:24:32] <dakship> spotify is proprietary
[16:24:36] <dakship> i was taking about ytdlp
[16:24:43] <dakship> glizzster[m]: no it isnt
[16:24:47] <dakship> at least for me
[16:24:59] <dakship> isnt spotify also electron based
[16:25:28] <dakship> if you are ok with electron def try nuclear
[16:31:15] <glizzster[m]> i also hate spotify
[16:31:27] <glizzster[m]> but i didnt had any great options at that time
[16:31:31] <glizzster[m]> so i just started using it with adblocker
[16:31:34] <glizzster[m]> and got used to it
[16:31:59] <smud[m]> <dakship> "i never ever found a song..." <- Problem with youtube is that all formats are compressed, so you don't get high quality audio
[16:33:49] <dakship> the audio is good enough for me
[16:33:59] <dakship> my crappy speakers cant tell the difference anyways
[16:34:05] <glizzster[m]> lol
[16:45:20] <smud[m]> I use this site, found in it the r/piracy megathread: free-mp3-download.net
[16:50:51] <dakship> does it download from yt
[16:59:09] <Aaron[m]1> <smud[m]> "Problem with youtube is that all..." <- I think you are partly wrong spotify offers max 160 kbps quality for free account and youtube offers max 256 kbps but spotify premium offers max 320 kbps quality 
[16:59:09] <Aaron[m]1> So unless you are spotify premium user you are better off with youtube
[17:00:24] <Aaron[m]1> <smud[m]> "I use this site, found in it the..." <- This site just reencodes mp3s to flacs so no quality difference between them

[21:38:00] <Zbnssn[m]> good question but data going on swap is p rare unless you do stuff that overloads your ram
[21:40:15] <Zbnssn[m]> I use vm on which I have an encrypted root  partition so it decrypts/encrypts whenever I log in... On the wiki I saw a warning to not run this on SSD because it would shorten it's lifespan quickly because SSDs have limited write cycles so I have it on my HDD
