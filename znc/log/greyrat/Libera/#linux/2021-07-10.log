[00:34:48] <jabberwock> I thought you were changing the FS type on a drive that had data. my bad
[00:35:09] <RedNifre> Yes, I have blkid
[00:35:56] <fakuve> so basically when you rsync from Windows to Linux , backs and forths you will be loosing the permissions while in Windows
[00:36:01] <omero> good. then before you attempt changing 'partition types' in the blind, you want to make sure you really are doing it on the 'correct spot'

[00:36:24] <omero> fakuve, that pretty much sums it up. yes.

[03:19:13] <sklv> like fine if that's the default, but give me the option to reserve 100GB for a critical VM

[04:48:22] <wwalker> is there a way to change the **resolution** of the vt console (not the font size, the resolution) preferably in real time, but at boot is semi-acceptable  .

[05:51:26] <Dagmar> Just getting somethign to do that with actual arrays made it apparent to me why it's not an option
[05:51:53] <Dagmar> Each row or column would be dependent on subsequent rows and columns, progressively
[05:52:05] <circuitbone> In context you have containers for data and other containers for layout.
[05:52:13] <circuitbone> Which are essentially divs.
[05:52:25] <pnbeast> Do you have a container for beer?
[05:52:39] <Dagmar> Yeah, and if you switch grid to going down then across instead of the default, you can only set how many _rows_ and it will keep that
[05:52:47] <rascul> pnbeast i have one, i call it a fridge
[05:52:58] <rascul> it stores other beer containers, which i call cans
[05:53:15] <Dagmar> So there's like, no way to have a 4x5 grid where say, the leftmost two columns are full and the rightmost two columns only have 4.  It'll always be 5, 5, 5, 3.

[06:47:40] <Sauvin> "I'm not a doctor, but I've played doctor in front of the TV from time to time..."
[06:47:46] <ayecee> seems like this goes beyond a conversation simulator and more into a teaching tool
[06:47:49] <circuitbone> So we all wear `emotiv epochs` and send emotions via brain waves?
[06:47:59] <ayecee> well i do
[06:48:13] <Sauvin> More like facial expressions, body language and tones of voice.
[06:48:23] <beltwaybob> im not a doctor but I know how the parts fit together
[06:48:29] <klysm> mat1010, what you need is a centralized rubric declaring the lobes of the brain, how the thalamus and other central regions interrelate, and all of this in didactic terms that you can understand as you write, let's be honest, your new program.
[06:48:48] <Sauvin> The challenge of online communication at a social level is injecting "emotional" implication into the text without grossly misprepresenting oneself.
[06:49:06] <Nosrep> true!
[06:49:18] <ayecee> grossly representing yourself doesn't fly either
[06:49:33] <Dagmar> Well, that depends.
[06:49:41] <Sauvin> Don't forget that the human mind probably runs on C, so, you'll need some oversight programs running to check for things like clobbered stack frames, null pointers, etc.
[06:49:55] <Dagmar> For people in Philly you can just replace every adjective with "f**kin'" and you're good
[06:50:05] <ayecee> brb, gotta take a stack dump
[06:50:13] <Sauvin> The human mind is one MASSIVELY complex and monstrously re-engineered binary tree.
[06:50:30] <ayecee> but is it turing complete?
[06:50:46] <Dagmar> Ask a psychotherapist about that
[06:50:56] <Sauvin> Just going by random samples taken from the production floor where I work, I'd say the base models aren't Turing complete, no.
[06:50:57] <circuitbone> The brain is a wet wired discriminator
[06:51:10] <klysm> making this realization is haps a cool hobby, not really something you can find answers for on the fly
[06:51:22] <Sauvin> "haps"?

[09:57:51] <Dagmar> Aside from the original problem being a bit silly, the simpler solution is to just use iptables to redirect queries to a local webserver _you control_

[09:58:26] <lautre[m]> Do you want forbidden to access outside? (internet, or the lan too?)

[09:59:39] <Conrad> Hi everyone. I haven't used Linux since the early 2000s but I want to install it on my junker Lenovo $300 special from 2018 that struggles to run Windows 10. A lightweight distro would be beneficial. Can ya throw me a recommendation?
[10:00:00] *** Joins: nac0 (~nac@user/nac)
[10:00:17] <circuitbone> The model number of the laptop would help.
[10:00:35] <lautre[m]> Conrad : XFCE, so you can try Debian live on usb
[10:00:38] <omero> Conrad, define 'lightweigt'
[10:00:56] <Conrad> I'll get the model number.
[10:01:11] <Dagmar> foucist: That is being done because if there's a capture portal operating (less sinister than it sounds) it'll try to speed things along by maybe punting you to the page where you click the little checkbox that says "I promise to be a good boy and follow the ToS"
[10:01:35] <Dagmar> There's not much _point_ in trying to intercept it from your own machine
[10:01:50] <Dagmar> Much fun to be had intercepting it for _other_ people, but for your own machine?  Pfft.
[10:02:28] <Dagmar> Proxy queries aren't the same as a browser making an http query of a webserver
[10:02:36] <omero> unless he is trying to come up with something that needs to be tested...
[10:03:46] <foucist> Dagmar: in this case the captive network assistant is rather limited, so it opens a limited browser that retains no cookies or login info, which forces me to close the assistant everytime, go to the actual browser and attempt to load a page, which then gets the redirect, and then i can use lastpass or whatever to finally login.. so the idea of adding a proxy layer would be to make it easier to automate
[10:03:47] <omero> that would really make sense. he might be interested to 'see' what's going on 'on his local' system... before interferring with 'some other one system'

[10:05:07] <foucist> i have to login everytime i change wifi or turn it off/on
[10:05:18] <Dagmar> For this case, I'd just _kill it_ and install your own hook that just makes the query to the webserver and POSTs your credentials
[10:05:50] <foucist> yeah but i wanted something more generalizeable.. as a tool for others to use as well since this is a common enough problem for people that travel a lot perhaps
[10:05:51] <Dagmar> Use something like Fiddler to intercept the entirety of what the browser sends when you login

[10:06:28] <Dagmar> Most people who travel a lot don't have to deal with capture portals that require a login
[10:06:54] <Dagmar> Half the hotels I've seen dont' require much beyond clicking a EULA
[10:07:25] <Dagmar> There's also another problem you might not have realized.
[10:07:26] <omero> the other half will just ask for a credit card number :)
[10:07:46] <circuitbone> The model number must of gotten lost in the mail.
[10:07:52] <Dagmar> Since these things typically don't have any good way of using a properly signed cert, you don't have any way of knowing for certain if YOU are connecting to the right thing
[10:08:11] <Dagmar> You'll just be automating something to hand your login and password to any wireless device that asks
[10:08:56] <circuitbone> I use a pi as a router firewall when I travel and if I have to drop a sim into a machine, I use a blank clean old phone.
[10:09:19] <foucist> well for each new wireless device that redirects to whatever page, i'd like to record what the browser sends, and then just do a replay of it the next time that happens

[10:10:43] <foucist> each time a forced redirect happens due to not having logged into the captive portal yet, there's probalby a unique URI (or other details).. can track that, and then replay the last successful login or checkbox acceptance or whatever..
[10:11:26] <Dagmar> They work by virtue of something I generally refer to as "I control the horizontal, I control the vertical"
[10:11:44] <Dagmar> Until you've signed off on the EULA, typically _all_ DNS queries will return the same answer
[10:11:57] <Dagmar> ...and it will point at the capture portal.

[10:34:29] <hexnewbie> ShapeShifter499: There are recovery tools that are filesystem-aware, and if they support your filesystem, you might get more metadata. Like extundelete (and ext4magic) for ext2/3/4. There are varying reports on whether that even works with modern flavours

[11:31:04] <RedNifre> Ok, got the statistics. I still don't know what's going on, but changing from rsync to cp boosted the speed from 300kB/s to 7500kB/s. So instead of waiting for 40 days, I'll expect to be done on Sunday \o/

[12:51:22] <curdlesnoot> RedNifre: I'm not sure why nohup even comes into this. it's certainly not needed to protect cp(1) in the case that it is backgrounded by an interactive instance of bash that exits. in any case, one downside is that you never learn what the exit status value of cp is. you could in principle, but probably are not doing so at present.

[13:03:08] <curdlesnoot> RedNifre: i.e. you tell bash to exit. it's not recieving a sighup from elsewhere and it's certainly not signalling itself to that end.
[13:03:41] <jim> NotAsysAdmin, if you have a root shell to the server, you can try: apt install openssh-server

[13:04:15] <curdlesnoot> RedNifre: another thing you might find interesting is that bash has a disown builtin. `some_command & disown` would remove some_command from bash's table of active jobs, even though it was responsible for spwaning it in the first place.

[16:06:30] <horseface> under installation, it simply says to:
[16:06:42] <horseface> 05. Flash the ROM and TWRP installer.
[16:06:52] <horseface> would this be adb sideload?
[16:06:58] <lopid> yes
[16:06:58] *** Joins: jacktar (~whiteshad@gateway/tor-sasl/jacktar)
[16:07:12] <horseface> and so what would the command look like?
[16:07:33] <lopid> you'd install twrp via fastboot, then boot into recovery (twrp) and sideload the rom
[16:07:49] <horseface> yes, i see...
[16:08:11] <horseface> so 'fastboot flash recovery x.zip'?
[16:08:14] <lopid> you could probably get away without installing twrp and using it "live"
[16:08:20] <lopid> for twrp, yes
[16:08:28] <horseface> thanks okay.

[16:12:15] <huria4> I'll just say yes to modern professional cinema camera for sake of argument. I don't know if the camera itself has to support linux or the cable connecting to linux has to support linux just to transfer the film.

[16:19:43] <hodapp> if you'd stop fixating on the "cable" for some reason, and look at something like the Red Digital cameras if you're fine with putting down 5 figures, they use REDMAG or RED MINI-MAG for storage which should just act like a block device in a reader

[17:36:46] <longxia> akik: I don't use docker but my impression is that it's often not a smooth ride. But I have only a few help channels to base my opinion on so it might be skewed.

[22:41:58] <omero> beltwaybob, aristotele is overrated but it is a necessary evil

[22:44:34] <omero> that is the problem in general with languages, beltwaybob
[22:44:41] <beltwaybob> I don't think it's a very big problem
[22:44:52] <void09> vhallac: unused drives, trying to set up a unionfs with all of them
[22:44:53] <beltwaybob> Aristotle provides the solution, these sounds reflect affections in the soul, which is a natural growth.
[22:45:05] <void09> actually mergerFS. Know any ? :)
[22:45:25] <beltwaybob> But that itself is not a suntheke, it is a diatheke, albeit not a legal diatheke, it's a natural diatheke, which does not include the sounds, only the affections.
[22:45:30] <omero> beltwaybob, I will be glad to explain. not here. here is not a good place.

[22:46:29] <beltwaybob> omero: At bottom I think it is only a problem if you are not actually a linguistic creature, that is, you just sor tof pragmatically deploy "sounds" without having nouns, etc.
[22:46:31] <vhallac> I would start with lvm. Make a volume group, add all your drives there, and

[22:49:47] <onelegend> I speak -1 languages
[22:49:59] <yogoyo> :D
[22:50:01] <vhallac> they would dump everything in the console
[22:50:03] <beltwaybob> Sauvin: If Aristotle is correct, it does not matter what language you express him in, because the meaning of words is predicated of affections in the soul, e.g. natural dispositions
[22:50:10] <void09> I speak 2+i languages
[22:50:12] <beltwaybob> Sauvin: Those dispositions are not things justified by verbal arguments, they are evolved

[23:28:44] <void09> but you get to use 100% of the space, vs mergerfs which cannot split a file on more than 1 disk
