[02:54:35] <drmeister> How does one kill a thread?   I remember that it was difficult (impossible?) to implement destroy-thread because signals and C++ exception handling don't talk to each other properly.
[02:55:47] <drmeister> Do implementations put something in to poll if a signal has been sent to a thread?   I'm off my threaded programming game.
[02:56:18] <MichaelRaskin> Signal? As in POSIX signal? Aren't they per-process anyway?
[02:57:27] <drmeister> And I freakin' implemented clasp's Bordeaux threads support - I should be answering the questions.
[02:57:43] <drmeister> Unix signal.
[02:58:11] <drmeister> Maybe that's a POSIX signal.  I always have to look things up.
[02:58:55] <MichaelRaskin> Unix/POSIX signals are surely same thing
[02:59:28] <MichaelRaskin> But if you use what POSIX considers threads inside the same process, you cannot send a signal to a thread, it is handled by a process
[02:59:56] <drmeister> Ok - one less thing to deal with.  What I do know is that a signal handler can set a global flag and a thread can poll that flag and then decide what to do with it.
[03:00:50] <MichaelRaskin> Oh wait, sorry
[03:00:59] <MichaelRaskin> There is tkill, too
[03:01:06] <MichaelRaskin> That sends to threads
[03:01:18] <MichaelRaskin> (but this is Linux-only)
[03:01:27] <drmeister> In Bordeaux threads there's destroy-thread. https://sionescu.github.io/bordeaux-threads/threads/destroy-thread/

[03:07:01] <yitzi> drmeister: Answered your bordeaux-threads question over in chat. I'll restate: those docs are for v2 and the v1 docs appear gone. Here is an archived copy. https://web.archive.org/web/20190921043635/http://trac.common-lisp.net/bordeaux-threads/wiki/ApiDocumentation
[03:08:06] <drmeister> MichaelRaskin: Thanks - I'm flailing a bit trying to figure out how this stuff is supposed to work and looking at my implementation to figure out what I did when I better understood how this works.   I see what I did now.   I implemented the underlying code of destroy-thread so that it registers an interrupt with the thread you want to destroy and when that checks its list of pending interrupts it unwinds the stack and shuts 
[03:08:06] <drmeister> down the thread.
[03:09:15] <drmeister> yitzi: Ah - so I'm not going crazy.  I thought I remembered the documentation being more complete.
[03:10:03] <drmeister> And there's a v2 for bordeaux threads - that's welcome - I guess. It would be nice to keep a link to the old documentation in the meantime while the new documentation is populated with "TODO"
[03:10:09] <yitzi> Yeah, it's kind of irritating. I just downloaded a copy on my machine cause I am always needing them.

[07:01:44] <pjb> drmeister: indeed. They're repl "commands", ie, functions intended to be called interactively from the REPL.  list-threads displays the list of threads. kill-thread calls list-threads, and let the user select a thread to kill it.
[07:02:16] <pjb> drmeister: this way, I don't have to remember how one kills a thread (when all I want to do is to kill blocked threads I forked from slime).
[07:04:04] <pjb> drmeister: of course, when you run slime/swank, there's also M-x slime-list-threads RET and  k (slime-thread-kill) …
[07:07:25] <pjb> drmeister: sometimes, a what a function brings, is only its name.  You didn't ask "How does one destroy a thread?", but "How does one kill a thread?", as any normal person woul do.  So naturally, what is needed is a kill-thread function, not a destroy-thread function. Try (apropos "KILL") !
[07:08:33] <pjb> drmeister: that's also what my tools/quicklisp.lisp provides, with a bunch of (quick-…) quicklisp commands.  Most are just renaming or thin layers on quicklisp stuff.  Some people have really twisted naming minds…

[16:15:10] <McParen> Hello, after a few weeks of Libera, can anybody compare the activity levels here and at freenode?
[16:15:30] <McParen> Is #lisp on freenode still the most active channel?
[16:15:45] <MichaelRaskin> #lisp on Freenode is dead
[16:18:15] <McParen> What about the two new chans here on libera, #lisp and #commonlisp? Is common lisp discusses here more actively or in #lisp?
[16:19:25] <MichaelRaskin> Well, the aim is to have #lisp close to old ##lisp and #commonlisp be about Common Lisp.
[16:19:26] <McParen> I only occasionally lurk, but for some reason do not want to monitor several channels to find out where the discussions have moved.
[16:19:33] <MichaelRaskin> It seems to drift in that direction
[16:20:39] <McParen> Has that been the case, that common lisp topics actually are kept to #commonlisp, or are they still discussed more in #lisp?
[16:21:53] <MichaelRaskin> Sometimes some people ask a question in #lisp which is mostly about Common Lisp. But I think most of the discussion in #lisp are such that Common Lisp and Scheme and Clojure answers are all appreciated
[16:27:30] <phoe> #lisp has some CL discussions now and then
[16:27:35] <phoe> but most of them happen in #commonlisp
[16:29:52] <McParen> Ok, that is what I wanted to know, thanks.

[17:35:23] <edgar-rft> McParen: basically freenode #lisp moved to Libera.Chat #commonlisp and freenode ##lisp moved to Libera.Chat #lisp. The reason for this is that on freenode many newbies joined #lisp and started to ask Scheme questions without reading the channel topic, so now Libera.Chat #lisp is for *all* Lisps and Libera.Chat #commonlisp is for Common Lisp only.
[17:35:56] <phoe> (and ##lisp redirects to #lisp)

[20:09:13] <ldb> beach: For example, in a interactive prompt of CLIM, the user can store some predefined actions by recording them, and replay these actions when needed
[20:10:24] <beach> The easiest way to do that is just to click on an previous interaction.  Every interaction is a presentation that can be re-executed by a click.
[20:12:09] <ldb> Is it possible to re-executed multiple interactions simultaneously? 
[20:12:43] <beach> I don't think so, no.
[20:13:08] * ldb if it does not fit into the design of CLIM I guess I can add some script interface then.
