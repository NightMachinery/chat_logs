[17:29:46] <FromGitter> <fleimgruber> Using the `zig` layer via https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+lang/zig/README.html and having installed the zig language server `zls`, upon opening a .zig file, the language server is not loaded and `lsp-mode` is nil. LSP works for other languages and servers alright on opening files. Any ideas on how to debug this?
[18:31:22] <FromGitter> <fleimgruber> Not a big deal, a simple M-x lsp starts the server alright, was just wondering why it does not behave like for the other modes or if this is configurable.

[20:10:28] <FromGitter> <manuel-arguelles> I have noticed something odd since using spacemacs, opening files from the arguments doesn't seem to work anymore, if I do `emacs /tmp/test.txt` for example, it just opens the spacemacs buffer and ignores the file
[20:12:01] <FromGitter> <manuel-arguelles> if I disable the org layer, then it works as expected...
[20:17:52] <FromGitter> <manuel-arguelles> oh it seems to be org-roam
[20:53:53] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> :(
[20:57:27] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> if LSP doesn't start automatically, it could be the directory is not added to LSP's project directories
[20:57:59] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> normally LSP prompts you about whether to import this directory

[21:15:16] <FromGitter> <fleimgruber> @lebensterben is the prompt depending on a matching language server capability that might not be provided by the Zig language server?
[21:15:39] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> nope
[21:16:04] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> the prompt sometimes doesn't show up for unknown reasons.
[21:16:19] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> close and reopen the buffer and usually you will see the prompt.
[21:16:51] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> there must be some other packages messing up stuffs.
[21:17:39] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> in my observation, this (prompt not showing up) most likely occurs when you just started Emacs
[21:18:27] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> because most packages are lazily loaded. when you opened the first buffer with a programming language, many packages are loaded in the background.
[21:18:53] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> which could possibly cause unexpected behaviours
[21:24:52] <FromGitter> <fleimgruber> I see. I tried closing and reopening as well as `(find-alternate-file)`, but prompt is not showing up.
[21:26:56] <FromGitter> <fleimgruber> But not a real issue, I was just curious.
[21:30:33] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> if it's added already it won't show up.
[21:31:01] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> you can check via the file ~/.emacs.d/.lsp*
[21:31:15] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Cannot remember the full name
[21:32:06] <FromGitter> <fleimgruber> It is .lsp-session-v1 over here and does not contain the buffer path in question.
[21:42:38] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> you may add it to the list yourself

[23:04:41] <FromGitter> <alex-ilin> @lebensterben, could you tell me which package or layer binds the "SPC SPC" to `spacemacs/helm-M-x-fuzzy-matching`? Maybe I could reinstall that thing if I knew what it was.
[23:06:43] <FromGitter> <manuel-arguelles> global-git-commit-mode is not working for me... (I did add (require 'git-commit) to user-config, still it keeps loading the buffer as fundamental
[23:07:03] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> it's defined in completion/helm
[23:07:52] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> be aware that I can see this comment on iOS client but I cannot see who posted it. And I cannot see this comment on PC client.

[23:09:46] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> @manuel-arguelles You also need `(global-git-commit-mode t)`
[23:11:28] <FromGitter> <manuel-arguelles> @lebensterben yes I already have it
[23:12:04] <FromGitter> <manuel-arguelles> still it fails to identify the buffer as a commit, I'm running it with emacs -nw not sure if that has something to do
[23:12:16] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> What's the result of `echo $GIT_EDITOR` in shell?

[23:26:06] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> it looks like you're also on bugOS.
[23:27:50] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> @manuel-arguelles are you on `master` branch?
[23:33:07] <FromGitter> <manuel-arguelles> Already did

[23:33:24] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Yeah thanks
[23:44:24] <FromGitter> <manuel-arguelles> Talking about LSP, has something changed? find other is not longer working... (`SPC m g a`) that was my favorite shortcut
[23:45:01] <FromGitter> <manuel-arguelles> now it's set to xref-find-apropos (no idea what that is)
