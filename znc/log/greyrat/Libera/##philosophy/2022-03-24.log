[06:17:36] <amigojapan> Hi str0 , what Is It?
[06:18:04] <amigojapan> I tried to look it up but I don't get it
[06:19:13] <Yin-Dawg> Reading about it now sounds cool
[06:19:21] <Yin-Dawg> basically chatting about how you arrived at your belief systems
[06:19:54] <amigojapan> Which belief system?
[06:20:03] <Yin-Dawg> any
[06:20:11] <Yin-Dawg> how you form the views and beliefs that you have
[06:20:20] <Yin-Dawg> apply the Socrates method to belief systems
[06:20:22] <Yin-Dawg> super cool
[06:20:33] <amigojapan> I am not sure how I arrived at my entire belief system
[06:20:55] <Yin-Dawg> then it's probably worth pondering now?
[06:21:07] <amigojapan> Umm ok
[06:22:03] <amigojapan> I know that entering and leaving a Japanese cult probably had a big influence in my general belief system
[06:22:38] <Yin-Dawg> WOW, definitely that would have had huge impact...
[06:22:51] <amigojapan> Yep
[06:23:29] * Lumine tries to remember the earliest times he entered into his current beliefs
[06:23:47] <amigojapan> For a while after leaving I was left wondering what parts of the cult teachings I should keep and which I should discard
[06:24:09] <str0> Yeah it's pretty cool, I've been a part of the community for a while now.
[06:24:42] <str0> It's mostly a method of approaching people with questions, rather than arguments.
[06:25:10] <str0> You can remain completely neutral and still change someone's view on something by making them thinking about it
[06:25:14] <amigojapan> Lumine: some of them must go back to childhood
[06:25:18] <str0> think*
[06:26:05] <Lumine> amigojapan: perhaps, but I've discard almost all of my childhood notions, which used to revolve around Christian doctrines
[06:26:10] <Lumine> discarded*
[06:26:48] <amigojapan> I see Lumine . I was not bright up in a family that pushed religion on me
[06:26:57] <Lumine> Neither was I
[06:27:04] <amigojapan> Brought up*
[06:27:08] <Lumine> But it was in the culture, the school system, and my peers
[06:27:33] <Lumine> The language they used
[06:27:53] <amigojapan> I see
[06:28:25] <Lumine> Plus I was told I was going to hell when I die when I was just a little kid
[06:28:36] <Lumine> So that left an impression
[06:30:05] <amigojapan> Lumine: I was never told that when I was a child
[06:31:22] <amigojapan> Not that I can remember anyway
[06:32:29] <Lumine> My earliest memories are from when I was 3 years old
[06:33:31] <str0> Mine are from around the same age, plus some 2 second flashbacks from when I was 2
[06:33:44] <amigojapan> Yeah I think my earliest memories must be from around 3, I remember going to the Montessori school
[06:34:01] <Lumine> You went to school at the age of 3?
[06:34:19] <amigojapan> Montessori is a kindergarten
[06:34:27] <Lumine> Still a little early to me
[06:34:41] <Lumine> I went to one at the age of 5
[06:34:42] <str0> It's where kids play while parents are at work
[06:35:21] <Lumine> Ah, the days when I didn't have appointed schedule, I just gamed with my father
[06:35:34] <amigojapan> At least I think I was 3, I don't have a calendar going back so far
[06:36:07] <amigojapan> Lumine: videogames?
[06:36:10] <Lumine> Yeah
[06:36:28] <amigojapan> Ah you must be much younger than me then
[06:36:39] <Lumine> How old are you
[06:36:53] <amigojapan> 44
[06:37:02] <Lumine> Yeah by 11 years
[06:37:09] <amigojapan> I see
[06:37:45] <str0> amigojapan, did you play any video games in your childhood
[06:37:57] <amigojapan> Altho we did have video games in the arcades
[06:38:21] <amigojapan> str0: I did but my dad hardly did at all
[06:39:12] <amigojapan> str0: I think I must have been like 8 years old when I got my Atari 2600
[06:39:23] <str0> Yeah, you were the first generation that was born into having accesible video games.
[06:39:34] <amigojapan> Yup
[06:39:47] <amigojapan> I am gen X
[06:41:40] <amigojapan> str0: but until 8 years old I had only played videogames at arcades
[06:42:34] <str0> Woah, arcades were out of trend long before 8 years.
[06:42:40] <str0> Where are you from?
[06:42:51] <amigojapan> Mexico
[06:44:27] <str0> Oh I misunderstood, I thought you said until 8 years ago
[06:44:29] <amigojapan> str0: arcades were still in vogue way after that when I was a kid, cause they had much better games than what you could achieve at home
[06:44:38] <amigojapan> No no
[06:45:15] <amigojapan> str0: more like 36 years ago
[06:45:21] <str0> Thats more like it
[06:45:41] <Lumine> Remember pinball machines
[06:45:52] <amigojapan> I do Lumine
[06:46:12] <Lumine> We had one at our local swimming pools
[06:46:34] <Lumine> I played it once or twice
[06:46:36] <amigojapan> Pachinko is a descendant of pinball machines
[06:47:06] <Lumine> I played more pinball on my Playstation
[06:48:05] <str0> My fair share of pinball was on windows, space cadet
[06:48:14] <str0> As much as I dislike windows that was a banger
[06:48:22] <Lumine> Yeah sounds about right
[06:48:34] <Lumine> I once played for like 12 hours straight at a friend's place
[06:48:39] <Lumine> Was off my hinges
[06:49:02] <Lumine> We had a competition
[06:49:37] <str0> I found a really cool pinball game for the pc engine/turbografix. It's called alien crush.
[06:49:55] <str0> I played it all night a few days back, sent me right to the past.
[06:50:29] <Lumine> I think the pinball game on PS was called Fantastic Pinball or something

[16:40:19] <amigojapan> brigand: shouldn't Pikachu have evolved long ago?
[16:40:36] <brigand> o
[16:41:32] <arryana> heya lumi, what's the good word
[16:42:05] <amigojapan> brigand: I think they kept him from evolving cause his original form is the cutest one
[16:43:29] <Lumine> Hello arryana, I'm having coffee as usual
[16:43:35] <arryana> excellent
[16:43:52] * arryana is finishing the beetroot, walnut, and goat cheese salad for lunch
[16:43:58] <Lumine> Yum
[16:44:37] <arryana> beetroot's such a seriously undervalued root
[16:45:04] <Lumine> I haven't had them in a while
[16:45:17] <Lumine> Last root I had was rootbeer
[16:45:25] <arryana> ooh
[16:45:39] <arryana> i dunno why they're always so cheap, but it's a thing here
[16:46:28] <Lumine> Unless you count carrots, then I had them yesterday
[16:46:39] <arryana> why not.
[16:46:52] <arryana> i like thoee too, but i like parsnips even more
[16:47:10] <Lumine> Yeah they're nice
[16:47:23] <arryana> i tend to shop by color, for veg.  to balance a bunch of them
[16:47:33] <Lumine> I see
[16:48:10] <arryana> while we don't eat every color every single day, we certainly have them at least a few times a week
[16:48:23] <Lumine> :)
[16:48:40] <arryana> sadly, here, food banks are overflowing with potatoes
[16:48:50] <arryana> people cant afford the energy to cook them
[16:49:07] <arryana> to me that's a sign of serious wrongness
[16:49:08] <Lumine> That is sad
[16:49:11] <arryana> yeah
