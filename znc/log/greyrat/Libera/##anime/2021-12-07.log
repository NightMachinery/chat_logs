[04:50:57] <sentionics> *I mean with you and Tomako
[04:51:32] <amigojapan> sentionics: the borders are closed still
[04:51:46] <sentionics> oh right. When will this pandemic end already
[04:52:00] <sentionics> my state, no one even cares here.
[04:52:14] <amigojapan> sentionics: it just for worse with Omicron
[04:52:31] <sentionics> They completely stopped wearing masks, aside from the rare employee (most employees aren't masked either)
[04:53:06] <sentionics> I don't want to die of covid. slowly can't breathe enough.
[04:53:15] <sentionics> slowly, can't, breathe...
[04:53:20] <sentionics> that's hell on earth man.

[04:54:01] <sentionics> but I'm in a red state.
[04:54:57] <sentionics> being an alcoholic might put me at a higher risk, despite the vaccination I got. You have to be approved for special reasons for the 3rd booster shot here, last I read.
[04:56:41] <amigojapan> sentionics: the US has a vaccination rate of about 60 percent, Japan has a vaccination rate of about 78 percent
[04:56:45] <sentionics> well, on the upside. I've seemingly been really lucky with most stuff in life somehow. Maybe I'll luck my way through any danger here. (let's be real, there is no luck, only results, and bias resulting from that is misguided)
[04:57:31] <sentionics> I uh, hope I continue to be lucky :/
[04:57:41] <amigojapan> sentionics: and vaccination started really late here

[05:00:06] <sentionics> that sucks man.
[05:00:20] <amigojapan> sentionics: we only have about 800 cases of Corona in Japan now
[05:01:19] <amigojapan> Nation wide
[05:01:55] <sentionics> I want to say I feel really bad about the US getting it quick but then half of us turning their noses up at it. But... I'm fed up with right-wing brainwashing around here. I don't really know how to feel anymore. Seems so easy to just say "screw you" to half these people. But they affect those around them. They keep the virus alive here. And also, much of my family are them.
[05:02:04] <sentionics> It's frustrating.

[05:04:50] <ButterNoodle> has he had it yet?
[05:05:12] <sentionics> possibly, but he's not had it bad if he has.
[05:05:25] <ButterNoodle> well
[05:05:28] <sentionics> he wouldn't know. He hasn't been to a doc in a while.
[05:05:42] <ButterNoodle> he allowed an opinion if he's had it
[05:06:02] <sentionics> gotta know you've had it first before spouting an opinion, imo
[05:06:17] <ButterNoodle> like I said
[05:07:30] <sentionics> whatever, I wouldn't really care that much, but he doesn't have to shit on me (indirectly) for getting vaccinated everytime I see him.

[06:52:57] <TsundereNoises> sentionics: amigo just doesn't like christmas, I LOVE christmas, and I give him shit about it every year, it's a long-running joke
[06:53:01] <SummerSkies> ah yes
[06:53:11] <Satin> davic: they speaking french to my ears
[06:53:15] <Satin> spanish*
[06:53:21] <Satin> idk what they're saying kappa
[06:53:23] <SummerSkies> vaporized seminal mist
[06:53:24] <TsundereNoises> *italian*
[06:53:27] <Satin> yeah
[06:53:28] <sentionics> well, I'm not a holiday man myself, amigojapan. blame it on living alone for years too much.
[06:53:30] <TsundereNoises> *catalan*
[06:53:35] <TsundereNoises> um
[06:53:42] <Satin> basque
[06:53:44] <Satin> ian
[06:53:45] <Satin> w/e
[06:53:47] <sentionics> people have to tell me what holiday it is, or I just miss it.
[06:53:54] <Satin> sentionics: easter
[06:54:03] <Satin> get out the bunny ears
[06:54:11] <sentionics> Satin: I know easter is in spring, but not which month.
[06:54:12] <SummerSkies> it's cinco de mayo
[06:54:15] <TsundereNoises> *romanian*
[06:54:23] <TsundereNoises> that's the one that's technically a romance language, right?
[06:54:45] <TsundereNoises> sentionics: easter is tricky because it changes every year, late march or early april
[06:55:03] <Satin> *bozal spanish*
[06:55:05] <sentionics> I recall doing stupid shit during easter egg hunts as a teenager. my cousins and I played some pranks on the youngsters, but we gave them the eggs we found. I like to think it made up for the mischief.
[06:55:10] <Satin> *any pidgin language*
[06:55:16] <TsundereNoises> Easter has dumb timing, it's like Hanukkah for Jesus-fans
[06:55:22] <Satin> sentionics: how old are you?
[06:55:26] <sentionics> I'm 36
[06:55:30] <Satin> i see
[06:55:35] <sentionics> I'm speaking of times from way long ago
[06:55:38] * Satin emerged from the void 22 years ago
[06:55:40] <sentionics> like 20+ years ago
[06:55:45] <Satin> yes
[06:56:02] <sentionics> Satin: I want to be 21 again :(
[06:56:13] <Satin> sentionics: I don't reccomend it personally
[06:56:19] <Satin> but then again idk
[06:56:23] <sentionics> :/ 21 sounds good to me
[06:56:32] <Satin> it's just been a pain in the ass for me
[06:56:43] <Satin> but that's just current me speaking who knows what future me will think
[06:56:53] <TsundereNoises> I want to be like 24 again, I think that's where I'd start my redo
[06:57:02] <amigojapan> Satin: what age do you want to be?
[06:57:06] <Satin> most of my 21st year was spent recovering from being shot tbh
[06:57:07] <TsundereNoises> that or like 15, but that'd be weird
[06:57:10] <Satin> amigojapan: 25s
[06:57:15] <sentionics> ah, you need a good programming teacher to teach you how to be a drunk and work as a programmer sometimes (just enough to survive but not enough to get anywhere's in life - this is the way).
[06:57:35] <Satin> lmao
[06:57:39] <sentionics> I know da way.
[06:57:39] <amigojapan> Satin: nothing changes, only time goes faster the older you are
[06:57:44] <Satin> dae wae
[06:57:50] <TsundereNoises> Satin: look at it this way, you'll (most likely) spend a lot less time in the hospital next year
[06:58:05] <Satin> amigojapan: I don't like the dating pool at around my age, I don't feel satisfied with my current progress in life around my age, and so on
[06:58:16] <Satin> will graduate late too thanks to being shortchanged by myself and life but oh well
[06:58:19] <Satin> TsundereNoises: tru
[06:58:22] <TsundereNoises> so date someone just a bit older who isn't a creep
[06:58:26] <TsundereNoises> need to beware of the creeps
[06:58:34] *** Quits: KOLANI (~KOLANI@104.163.174.140) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:58:51] <TsundereNoises> but some people have their shit just a bit more together, and that can make a difference
[06:58:57] <Satin> idk, I'm not really looking to date yet or anything but also my experiences with gen z peers are pretty bad
[06:59:04] <Satin> in some respects on that front
[06:59:08] <Satin> TsundereNoises: yes
[06:59:13] <sentionics> is watching jojo now. afk for a bit.
[06:59:14] <Satin> I'm assuming the 25s have their shit more together
[06:59:16] <TsundereNoises> I mean, people your age are fucking annoying from my perspective too
[06:59:17] <Satin> sentionics: have fun
[06:59:21] <sentionics> I heard the 6th is good
[06:59:22] <Satin> TsundereNoises: ikr.
[06:59:24] <sentionics> stone boys
[06:59:32] *** sentionics is now known as sentionics_
[06:59:38] <Satin> TsundereNoises: It's more like, when I was 16 some years ago I assumed people around 21-22 would be mature
[06:59:44] <amigojapan> Satin: you could wait 10 years are date someone 10 years older than you
[06:59:45] <TsundereNoises> that's funny
[06:59:46] <Satin> then I get around here and I'm not really...satisfied?
[06:59:51] <TsundereNoises> but I think I was the same way at 16
[06:59:55] <TsundereNoises> college kids were SO mature
[06:59:57] <TsundereNoises> pfft
[07:00:03] <Satin> Either all 21-22 year olds are not so mature
[07:00:05] <Satin> or, my generation
[07:00:13] <Satin> bunch of snowflakes /half j
[07:00:24] <Satin> :p
[07:00:25] <amigojapan> Satin: they are still kids
[07:00:37] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I think it's like how kids have been ruining everything forever since ancient greece
[07:01:08] <TsundereNoises> with their damn theater and harp music
[07:01:22] <Satin> I just want to talk to more people who aren't very childish and naive about shit and still sound like they're 16 in figuring out basic social relations out
[07:01:28] <Satin> too much to ask though
[07:01:54] <Satin> that being said, some of my best friends r great ppl and around my age, and plenty have their shit together
[07:02:02] <amigojapan> There is only a tiny difference between 16 and 21 Satin 
[07:02:04] <TsundereNoises> I mean, if you're looking for people with the social skills of clueless teenagers, you're in the right place‚Ä¶
[07:02:09] * Satin talked to a PhD lightning physicst dude the other night at a house party
[07:02:14] <Satin> amigojapan: disagreed
[07:02:16] <amigojapan> Satin: only 5 years
[07:02:20] <Satin> TsundereNoises: rofl
[07:02:27] <Satin> amigojapan: a lot changes in 5 years
[07:02:31] <Satin> when you're younger
[07:02:42] <Satin> when you're older 5 years isn't much change
[07:03:14] <Satin> I have traces of how I was when I was 16, but in general, as theholyduck once told me when i was younger 'it gets better when u reach adulthood'
[07:03:23] <amigojapan> No it does not.i have been 16 and 21 already Satin 
[07:03:31] <Satin> amigojapan: does for me :)
[07:04:10] <Satin> 18-19 was when I was finally stabilizing, getting my grip on being myself, and just being very chill in person than all the angst in the world
[07:04:55] <theholyduck> In parts being a teenager is great. No responsibility. All the free time really.
[07:05:01] <amigojapan> Satin: people are still kids till like 35
[07:05:06] <theholyduck> But it also really did
[07:05:10] <theholyduck> Er sucks

[07:06:15] <theholyduck> @amigojapan: I think there's a difference between acting childish

[07:07:00] <TsundereNoises> Satin: as someone just on the bring of adulthood according to amigo, I don't think I understand either
[07:07:14] <Satin> TsundereNoises: rofl "according to amigo"

[07:08:50] <Satin> TsundereNoises: wild.

[08:05:52] <MootPoot> Omega037: so the grandparent strategy, literally just what I said
[08:05:54] <Satin> fuck this gtk stuff actually has my head scratching for once
[08:06:02] <MootPoot> Satin: take a shower 
[08:06:07] <Omega037> MootPoot, doesn't have to be a grandparent
[08:06:11] <ButterNoodle> Satin: write some python for me
[08:06:16] <Omega037> Could just be a friend or someone running something in their basement
[08:06:22] <ButterNoodle> Omega037: no stranger is gonna watch ur kid for free
[08:06:24] <Omega037> Not ideal, but that is life for poor people
[08:06:31] <MootPoot> Omega037: grandparents are the only once we who will do it nonstop for free 
[08:06:32] <Omega037> Not free, but not $1k a month
[08:06:44] <ButterNoodle> not much less than what a daycare charges...
[08:06:44] <Omega037> A lot of the people having kids ARE the poorest
[08:06:46] <MootPoot> Randoms wont do it
[08:06:59] <Omega037> They have higher birth rates
[08:07:00] <ButterNoodle> Omega037: that is a fact
[08:07:13] <ButterNoodle> because stupid people keep shitting out kids
[08:07:15] <Omega037> It is educated, middle and upper classes that could afford $1k a month that have less
[08:07:17] <ButterNoodle> they dont know any better
[08:07:20] <Omega037> And yet, they don't all die
[08:07:21] <MootPoot> Omega037: they do it by just letting their kids free and not being taken care of
[08:07:23] <MootPoot> That's how
[08:07:26] <Omega037> So clearly, it is possible
[08:07:33] <Omega037> Nobody is leaving a 1 year old home alone
[08:07:34] <ButterNoodle> *not ideal
[08:07:41] <Omega037> Yeah, not ideal
[08:07:44] <MootPoot> Not even close to ideal
[08:07:52] <ButterNoodle> yea
[08:07:55] <MootPoot> Or acceptable
[08:07:56] <Omega037> That is the thing about money, as you make more you find ways to spend more
[08:08:04] <Omega037> Better schools
[08:08:06] <Omega037> Better food
[08:08:09] <Omega037> Better housing
[08:08:16] <Omega037> Better after school activities
[08:08:19] <Omega037> etc
[08:08:28] <Satin> better wealth disparities with the rest of the have-nots
[08:08:33] <Omega037> I grew up fairly low middle class
[08:08:38] <ButterNoodle> I remember the days of scraping together change to get baby formula and hot dogs, when next in like people were getting fillets and lobster tails on EBT cards..
[08:08:42] <MootPoot> That was a quick shower Satin 
[08:08:48] <Satin> no i never went anywhere

[08:09:05] <ButterNoodle> its better to be real poor than just a little poor
[08:09:09] <Omega037> We used to be either watched at my parents' work (when they had a day care) or by an old neighbor lady
[08:09:13] <ButterNoodle> Satin: how was the shower
[08:09:16] <Omega037> Never lived near family
[08:09:19] <ButterNoodle> was it hot or cold?
[08:09:34] <Omega037> Anyways, I know tons of people having kids
[08:09:47] <ButterNoodle> I dont know tons of people anymore
[08:09:49] <Omega037> I think if you are a childfree person, you likely socialize with a lot of childfree people
[08:09:49] <ButterNoodle> I dont like them

[08:09:52] <MootPoot> But anyway, the only people you can mostly trust to take care of your kids are your grandparents.. And the way modern life is , moving around so much away from family fucks that over
[08:10:26] <ButterNoodle> would have rather my parents help w the kids.. but thats a story for another day
[08:10:51] <Omega037> Yeah, we haven't had any help like that
[08:10:59] <ButterNoodle> Satin: go shower and report back
[08:11:03] <Satin> Omega037: I mean I think you're correct that it's not as crazily low as people on IRC or people who don't have kids might make it out to be, but at the same time there is a very sustained trend of people having less kids, to the point where demographic sociologists and what not are sounding the alarm bells.
[08:11:06] <MootPoot> So then if you are couple making like 45-50k each , effectively you make your wife stop working 
[08:11:19] <Satin> and the cost of raising kids is very very very clearly higher than before, post 2008
[08:11:30] <MootPoot> Or if you give everything to day-care and STILL have to put time in when you get f home
[08:11:41] <Satin> https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57003722
[08:11:41] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: if ur combined income is 100K.. you can afford daycare

[08:12:08] <Omega037> Satin, COVID numbers are gonna be unusable
[08:12:08] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: the problem is that daycare is not 24/7 , so you still have to put in the time 
[08:12:19] <Omega037> We have just had my wife stay home
[08:12:22] <MootPoot> Grandparents are 24/7
[08:12:29] <Satin> that was for 2020
[08:12:34] <Satin> in general the trend is lower.
[08:12:35] <ButterNoodle> the problem is when the cost of daycare and the cost of going to work is the same or more than the after tax monies
[08:12:36] <Omega037> Satin, exactly
[08:12:42] <Omega037> 2019 was 1.70
[08:12:42] <ButterNoodle> keep in mind day care is a tax write off
[08:12:48] <Omega037> 1978 was like 1.76

[08:13:02] <MootPoot> Anyway, 2d kids are much cheaper to raise 
[08:13:04] <MootPoot> So
[08:13:09] <MootPoot> I know what I'm doing
[08:13:12] <Omega037> Satin, impossible to tease that apart
[08:13:21] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: and u can throw em in the trash when you stop liking them
[08:13:25] <Omega037> Statistics is literally my expertise
[08:13:36] <MootPoot> Or is it 
[08:13:37] <Omega037> I believe the decline is mostly due to the drop in religiousness and community
[08:13:42] <Satin> "While the pandemic may have played some role in the number of births during the final weeks of the year, the overall picture is more indicative of a continued fertility decline that started years before the public health crisis. Since 2014, the last year during which the number of births increased, the country has experienced a six-year downward streak, averaging 2% fewer births per year. "
[08:13:48] <Satin> "Birth rates have been sinking across demographics, and 2020 was no exception. Every race and ethnic group and every age group between 15 and 44 (which account for 99.7% of births) had a lower rate."
[08:13:54] <MootPoot> Sex
[08:13:57] <MootPoot> Not enough
[08:13:59] <MootPoot> Sex
[08:14:06] <Omega037> Wait, is it for the year ending in 2019 or the year 2020
[08:14:06] <ButterNoodle> yea.. wife works at an OB.. "pandemic babies" are a thing
[08:14:24] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: lol I was thinking about putting money into diaper company stock 
[08:14:32] <ButterNoodle> lets not bring up the statistics of miscarriages since covid tho
[08:14:34] <MootPoot> For the pandemic baby boom 
[08:14:35] <Omega037> Because 2020 would have had people living very different lifestyles
[08:14:40] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: ur too late
[08:14:44] <Omega037> Regardless, people can still have and raise kids
[08:14:51] <Satin> Omega037: I don't think it's just mostly the drop in religiousness and community.
[08:14:52] <MootPoot> Why do they call it a miscarriage anyway 
[08:14:52] <ButterNoodle> yea
[08:14:54] <Omega037> People choose not to primarily due to a lack of social pressure
[08:14:57] <Omega037> Changing norms
[08:14:59] <Satin> Economy is a big one, and many economists point that out.
[08:15:02] <Omega037> Not having kids is more accepted now
[08:15:12] <ButterNoodle> yea I was thinking about picking up a 2nd wife through this
[08:15:17] <Omega037> People used to either feel compelled or see it as a goal
[08:15:21] <ButterNoodle> would spice things up
[08:15:21] <Satin> I don't know why it feels like you're trying to avoid acknowledging that factor.
[08:15:28] <MootPoot> Satin: afaik a lot of people in their 20s are okay with the idea of having kids but  can't handle the price
[08:15:43] <MootPoot> Don't remember numbers 
[08:15:44] <MootPoot> Tho
[08:15:47] <Satin> MootPoot: Yep. Surveys show many young women do want kids, but the costs of living simply don't allow them to.
[08:15:48] <Omega037> Satin, birth rate didn't suddenly recover in boom times recently
[08:16:03] <ButterNoodle> u know
[08:16:14] <MootPoot> Now people keep those little rat dogs and cats instead of kids 
[08:16:14] <ButterNoodle> lets stop all this talking and just go try to make some more kids..
[08:16:14] <Satin> Omega037: because even in the boom times it's not affordable compared to before for many people
[08:16:15] <ButterNoodle> ez
[08:16:18] <Omega037> Anyways, I'm not sure why we are arguing about it
[08:16:22] <Omega037> ButterNoodle, my wife is done
[08:16:25] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: sex time 
[08:16:31] <ButterNoodle> Omega037: w sex?
[08:16:31] <Omega037> I'm actually gonna get snipped soonish
[08:16:38] <Omega037> With having kids
[08:16:38] <Satin> snipped = ?
[08:16:40] <MootPoot> Omega037: squeezed all the juice out of her?
[08:16:41] <ButterNoodle> oh
[08:16:43] <Omega037> I would have liked a fourth

[08:16:50] <MootPoot> Lmao
[08:16:52] <Omega037> Satin, vasectomy
[08:16:54] <Satin> Oh.
[08:17:15] <Omega037> Our youngest is autistic, which took some wind out of our sails
[08:17:17] <ButterNoodle> was gonna say.. if she done having sex, hope she's Mormon. .cause its time for wife #2 to enter the picture :)
[08:17:20] <Omega037> Plus she is already 38
[08:17:22] <Satin> I'm not a guy so... why do guys do that again?
[08:17:31] <MootPoot> If it's a woman we don't snip though, up here we use the auger that we use for punching a hole during ice fishing

[08:18:40] <MootPoot> Satin: you know... I remember Dahi being yoghurt in Indian

[08:19:28] <Omega037> The sperm ends up in the vas deferens
[08:19:41] <Satin> Are you a biologist or something
[08:19:44] <Omega037> The seminal vesicales are the sperm
[08:19:45] <Omega037> Sorta
[08:19:47] <Satin> I remember you working in gene stuff
[08:19:53] <Satin> or something like that a while ago
[08:19:56] <Omega037> So anyways, you cut off the vas deferens
[08:19:59] <ButterNoodle> Omega037: nice explanation, but how will this help me install windows server 2003 on a core2 duo?
[08:20:00] <Omega037> Now you get no sperm
[08:20:04] <Omega037> Just delicious semen

[08:20:23] <Omega037> and I work for a massive Biotech company

[08:20:42] <ButterNoodle> O.o
[08:20:42] <Satin> how much chemistry did you have to do
[08:20:46] <Omega037> General rule of thumb is you can only make semen worse
[08:20:48] * Satin has been considering bioinformatics
[08:20:49] <MootPoot> We have sex here on a lake, then we come back when she's about 7 months pregnant and make a hole in the ice - slap her stomach as hard as possible with a beaver tail while she is lifted into the air by a moose, baby plonks into the ice lake and we dump maple syrup in the hole.  Roll forward 2 months they climb out during the spring thaw 
[08:21:00] <Omega037> I took like basic chem, that was it
[08:21:03] <Satin> MootPoot: lol
[08:21:09] <Satin> Omega037: so biology isn't that big on chemistry?
[08:21:14] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: thats how I understood it
[08:21:16] <Omega037> Well, I took the 1 semester course that was sometimes 2 semesters for others
[08:21:18] <Satin> no organic chem?
[08:21:24] <Omega037> My program wasnt, no orgo chem
[08:21:28] <Satin> lucky
[08:21:40] <Omega037> We did animal physiology and Cell/Molecular Biology

[09:06:31] <MootPoot> same
[09:06:32] <sentionics> make my nose bleed snot.
[09:06:35] <MootPoot> except there is a catch
[09:06:51] <MootPoot> it has to be under the threshold 
[09:06:57] <MootPoot> if I cant taste anything else except spice
[09:06:59] <MootPoot> its meh
[09:07:06] <sentionics> I see what you mean.
[09:07:31] <sentionics> spice is supposed to amplify flavour with a bit of pain, that's my opinion.
[09:07:55] <sentionics> but if there's no flavour, or the flavour is shit, well, no amplification in the world will fix it.
[09:08:25] <listen_ers> dragon chicken peppers with oxtail broth
[09:08:39] <sentionics> that sounds sexy as hell, listen_ers
[09:08:48] <listen_ers> its crunchy its a good change up
[09:08:57] <listen_ers> good kick not very spicy
[09:09:00] <sentionics> oh my god, I'm horny to eat that.
[09:09:06] <sentionics> what, I want it spicy
[09:09:07] <listen_ers> almost like spicer green pepers i guess
[09:09:16] <MootPoot> japanese spice is a joke
[09:09:25] <sentionics> I want it hot as hell
[09:09:26] <MootPoot> I had a japanese guy I knew 
[09:09:38] <MootPoot> who gave me "extra spicy food" according to him
[09:09:44] <MootPoot> and was really talking it up
[09:09:51] <MootPoot> it wasent particuarly spicy
[09:09:52] <MootPoot> or good
[09:10:02] <MootPoot> it just like eating a spoonful of paprika
[09:10:46] <sentionics> if there is a hell, I wonder, will the true God (whatever religion has Him pegged properly as God) forgive my drunkenness, will He toss me away to damnation?
[09:11:18] <sentionics> well at any rate, I'm not a believer in any of that supernatural stuff, so guess I'm defaulted to the Hell trashcan for most gods.
[09:11:54] <sentionics> but if you can show me actual supernatural stuff, I'll change my mind.
[09:12:14] <sentionics> video stuff these days doesn't work though on that note, obviously.
[09:12:32] <sentionics> gotta see it myself, which is also part of why it'd never happen even if there was a God.
[09:12:54] <sentionics> I am forever lost.
[09:13:55] <sentionics> Or more realistically, my typical short human life isn't owned by religion (so I at least get something out of it, at least for a little while).
[09:14:20] <MootPoot> I think I get why I keep borking my liunx installs 
[09:14:22] <MootPoot> I just did it again
[09:14:54] <sentionics> often times, simply following the defaults gets you something working.
[09:15:15] <sentionics> reconfigure after you get to the initial working state.
[09:15:41] <sentionics> MootPoot: what flavour of linux?
[09:16:06] <MootPoot> its mostly ubuntu or debian
[09:16:19] <sentionics> I use ubuntu 20.04 for WSL.
[09:16:24] <MootPoot> but basically -> apt get install or upgrade gets interuppted
[09:16:34] <MootPoot> then dpkg breaks
[09:16:44] <MootPoot> then I have to do some fancy command to rebuild it
[09:16:44] <sentionics> what's the first error message? 
[09:17:28] <sentionics> the thing about dependency chains. The error message that matters is the first one. Fuck the rest.
[09:17:31] <MootPoot> okay , uh
[09:17:38] <MootPoot> I install the OS 
[09:17:41] <MootPoot> ssh into it 
[09:17:52] <MootPoot> apt update and upgrade
[09:18:04] <MootPoot> upgrade takes a while , get interuppted or something happens
[09:18:13] <sentionics> uh, that never should error out
[09:18:15] <MootPoot> then ssh reezes
[09:18:17] <MootPoot> freezes
[09:18:20] <sentionics> wtf, how is your shit even hosted

[09:18:53] <sentionics> I can't really help in that case
[09:19:04] <sentionics> that's some curious way to do it.
[09:19:14] <sentionics> I always just use hosting services.

[09:20:04] <MootPoot> it works okay - but then  I try to do stuff

[09:20:29] <sentionics> a fucked install/config will bite relentlessly again and again until you unfuck it.
[09:20:50] <MootPoot> it errors out saying that grub-efi--amd64 keeps returning on an error
[09:20:55] <MootPoot> at least I get what/why its happening now
[09:21:01] <sentionics> either understand why and how, or start over and pray.
[09:21:14] <sentionics> well, praying won't help, but you get the idea.
[09:21:16] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot u ever ask in deb's channel?
[09:21:30] <MootPoot> nah- this is the first time I looked at it since like friday

[09:21:42] <MootPoot> I was waiting for a capture card so I could go into bios and see
[09:21:52] <MootPoot> I made it boot off the microsd aaaand borked it again
[09:21:52] <ButterNoodle> lmc if I have any docs on efi..
[09:21:54] <MootPoot> lmao
[09:22:01] <ButterNoodle> may not be worth a shit since its for arch
[09:22:02] <sentionics> ButterNoodle's advice is best. I forget to mention, you should chat in places that mainline the stuff.
[09:22:02] <MootPoot> well I can just re-image

[09:22:57] <ButterNoodle> btw arch may work on that
[09:23:19] <ButterNoodle> I'm using arch rn
[09:23:21] <MootPoot> they have special images for it

[09:23:29] <sentionics> ButterNoodle: it's a valid solution in general: if one distro fucks up, try a different one.
[09:23:30] <ButterNoodle> runnit
[09:23:41] <MootPoot> but there is a YT video showing a dude just doing the normal ubuntu website download and install
[09:23:45] <MootPoot> so I presume you can do both

[16:30:13] <HeTo> Satin: you could print the widget pointers when you are creating them and then print the widget pointer the shortcut is invoked on. use %p for printf to print a void*. would also recommend printing the pointer when you destroy a widget. that way you can check if the pointers are what you would expect them to be and that the thing hasn‚Äôt been destroyed
[16:30:27] <HeTo> or something similar if you are using some other pointer than the widget pointer

[17:22:46] <listen_ers> why
[17:22:50] <listen_ers> it does text boxes
[17:22:51] <isekaijin> Finding close strings is an algorithms problem.
[17:22:56] <isekaijin> Not a UI problem.

[17:23:21] <listen_ers> on the contrary if you dont get a clear vision like that that its not a good attitude like reach for a pencil and throwing it back

[18:39:13] <ButterNoodle> I do like cousins tho
[18:39:17] <analoq> Jigsy: my cousin's birthday is on christmas ^.^
[18:39:25] <Jigsy> I have too many cousins.

[18:39:41] <analoq> Jigsy: i think mine is 29 :D

[18:39:55] <analoq> oh
[18:39:58] <analoq> missed that one
[18:40:23] <ButterNoodle> holy crap.. my trash has already been picked up.. its 10 am
[18:40:57] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: homeless guy was hungry
[18:41:01] <analoq> well tbf. christmas is on different dates depending on where you live. in my case it's the 24. well legally it's the 25 and 26. but the presents here are given on the 24th
[18:41:07] <ButterNoodle> must love cardboard..
[18:41:32] <amigojapan> 26?
[18:41:32] <Jigsy> I don't really bother with Christmas.
[18:41:48] <amigojapan> Jigsy: I hate Christmas
[18:41:55] <Jigsy> Same.
[18:42:02] <ButterNoodle> I love Christmas cake girls tho
[18:42:05] <TsundereNoises> also it's much more likely than people realize to have 2 people have overlapping birthdays in a small group (i.e. people we know)
[18:42:27] <analoq> amigojapan: 1st and 2nd christmas day. 24th is christmas eve
[18:42:28] <ButterNoodle> I actually like chirstmas, but the people ruin it
[18:42:43] <ButterNoodle> and ur family ruins it
[18:42:53] <TsundereNoises> I love christmas, but it helps if I can avoid any retail establishments in the month of december
[18:42:59] <amigojapan> analoq: aren't there 12 days of Christmas?
[18:43:13] <analoq> not here. as far as i know :p
[18:43:29] <analoq> but i wouldnt mind 12 days off
[18:43:30] <TsundereNoises> yeah but outside of songs, no one has really cared about the "12 days of christmas" concept in like 200 years
[18:43:32] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: I love blowing money at christmas
[18:43:36] <amigojapan> analoq: in Japan it's not a national holiday at all
[18:43:44] <analoq> understandable
[18:43:54] <ButterNoodle> money is the name of my crack dealer
[18:44:00] <TsundereNoises> it used to be much harder to travel, so longer celebrations made more sense
[18:44:23] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: yeah, I like giving gifts too, I like finding things that people like that they wouldn't otherwise be aware of

[18:45:09] <analoq> death fixed christmas for me ^.^
[18:45:16] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: not in the same way, I mean that having a 12 day celebration made more sense when you had to travel a long distance by carriage/wagon/sleigh to get anywhere

[18:58:07] <analoq> 3:
[18:58:28] <TsundereNoises> christmas music should ideally be without lyrics and played by a brass quartet
[18:59:00] <amigojapan> analoq: have you seen the 4k version of that video, the original remastered?
[18:59:02] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: a lot of those are not yule traditions though
[18:59:10] <TsundereNoises> the tree is
[18:59:14] <TsundereNoises> I believe
[18:59:26] <amigojapan> It is TsundereNoises 
[18:59:40] <TsundereNoises> but a lot of the food stuff cannot possibly be
[19:00:02] <TsundereNoises> I don't think the ancient germans made cake
[19:00:08] <TsundereNoises> much less rolled it into logs
[19:00:31] <TsundereNoises> and they definitely didn't use espresso filling
[19:00:36] <TsundereNoises> which is VITAL to the tradition!
[19:01:28] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: "eggnog has been associated with Christmas since the 1700s.
[19:02:28] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: exactly
[19:02:34] <TsundereNoises> that's my point
[19:02:44] <TsundereNoises> eggnog was not a pre-roman invention
[19:02:54] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: that means it was plagiarized
[19:03:02] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: no it doesn't
[19:03:22] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I think you're confused by over a thousand years about history
[19:05:05] <MootPoot> still going on about christmas?
[19:05:14] <amigojapan> "It is believed that eggnog began in Europe.¬†As early as the 13th century, medieval monks in Britain were known to drink "posset," a warm ale punch with eggs and figs. Over time, this likely merged with the various milk and wine punches often served at social gatherings.
[19:05:42] <amigojapan> MootPoot: when will it end. TsundereNoises made it yearly
[19:05:58] <amigojapan> Made it daily I mean
[19:06:25] <amigojapan> MootPoot: every day is Christmas for him
[19:06:52] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: 1700s is american revolution, and 1200s (i.e. 13th century) is high middle ages, castles and everyone being super christian and throwing inquisitions
[19:07:16] <amigojapan> I see TsundereNoises 
[19:07:47] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I will admit to liking eggnog
[19:07:54] <TsundereNoises> these are not times where yule was widely celebrated is my point
[19:08:04] <TsundereNoises> your sense of history is way off
[19:08:48] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I shall drink eggnog during summer to nog you
[19:08:58] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: that's fine, egg nog is great
[19:09:12] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: although unless you make it yourself, at least here you can only get it from like thanksgiving to new year
[19:09:14] <amigojapan> Yeah
[19:09:33] <amigojapan> Yeah I will make it
[19:09:38] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: those eggs are good for muscle building though
[19:09:44] <TsundereNoises> they might help with the feats of strength

[19:13:24] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I don't see why you would especially, but I don't know without looking up why someone thinks that would be fatal
[19:13:28] <TsundereNoises> it probably isn't good for you
[19:14:21] <TsundereNoises> but eggs aren't that exciting, and it can't be like water toxicity or anything
[19:14:35] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: someone mentioned the other day that someone had a bet that he had to eat 50 eggs, and he died after it
[19:15:35] <MootPoot> I can eat 50 eggs

[19:23:14] <amigojapan> Die, not sure
[19:23:29] <TsundereNoises> and the record is 69 hotdogs, but people like that have extra expandable stomachs
[19:23:42] <TsundereNoises> like you could not just go beat the world eating record
[19:23:47] <isekaijin> listen_ers: What example?
[19:24:02] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I mean, I don't think there are really THAT many hotdog-related deaths per year anyway

[19:24:18] <TsundereNoises> choking or otherwise
[19:24:19] <listen_ers> it works
[19:24:20] <TsundereNoises> hi Urchin[emacs]
[19:24:40] <isekaijin> listen_ers: Have you tried it in my ‚Äúhello world‚Äù and ‚Äúahello world‚Äù test case?
[19:24:53] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: my stomach says "hey you could easily eat 50 eggs" but I guess those instincts can be wrong
[19:25:01] <listen_ers> no cause that compiles for easy
[19:25:13] <isekaijin> ?
[19:25:43] <isekaijin> I'm not sure what compilation has to do with this.
[19:26:20] <isekaijin> listen_ers: It only seems to complete prefixes.
[19:26:57] <listen_ers> no the functionality for replacing the text in the box isnt there
[19:26:59] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yes, I really don't think you could, but I don't know, maybe you could
[19:27:14] <listen_ers> but the rest is there, like word prediction
[19:27:20] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: but also your stomach would probably start telling you it was a bad idea partway through, and if you listen to it you should be fine
[19:27:27] <TsundereNoises> instead of pushing on until you actually kill yourself
[19:27:41] <listen_ers> just do tab completion plus selecting basic stuff
[19:27:53] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: hmm, it seems only 2 people died last year from choking from mochi. That may be like choking from anything https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42537953.amp

[19:28:09] <TsundereNoises> yeah, 2 people die per year of any dumb thing you can imagine
[19:28:27] <amigojapan> I see TsundereNoises 
[19:28:32] <listen_ers> but for the correct word it does work
[19:28:44] <listen_ers> so im not sure i would use it if i did use text boxes myself
[19:28:45] <TsundereNoises> out of all the people in the world, someone is going to die from anything stupid you can think of
[19:28:52] <listen_ers> i like it
[19:29:03] <TsundereNoises> single digits are just not surprising with how many people there are
[19:29:04] <listen_ers> and plus its better then nothin
[19:29:11] <listen_ers> much
[19:29:15] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I often choak when I eat steak. Especially when I am starving
[19:29:24] <isekaijin> listen_ers: I just tried it. It only completes prefixes.
[19:29:49] <isekaijin> I'm not saying that it's useless. I'm only saying that it doesn't really do anything beyond complete after a given prefix.
[19:29:50] <listen_ers> the second box does complete guesses
[19:30:06] <listen_ers> its the dictionary theres not many words
[19:30:06] <isekaijin> listen_ers: I tried all four boxes.
[19:30:19] <isekaijin> I wrote ‚Äútoalt‚Äù, and it didn't guess ‚Äútotal‚Äù.
[19:30:26] <listen_ers> as in (for satins case) would be the book library which wouldnt be much to do even then rather then predicting speech
[19:30:31] <listen_ers> it does
[19:30:34] <listen_ers> actually

[19:31:34] <listen_ers> yes yours isnt working
[19:31:47] <listen_ers> it compile in two seconds this example
[19:31:56] <isekaijin> It just completes after a given prefix.
[19:32:02] <isekaijin> This is, of course, super easy to implement.
[19:32:04] <isekaijin> Just use a trie.
[19:32:24] <isekaijin> (But, of course, it is even better if the library already does it for you.)
[19:32:44] <isekaijin> But doing useful autocomplete after the user makes a typo is actually rather hard.
[19:33:16] <listen_ers> the second box seems to be doing it
[19:33:21] <listen_ers> ofcourse its hard

[19:33:54] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I need to chew my steak much more before swallowing it whole
[19:34:00] <listen_ers> theres definitely not working on yours
[19:34:10] <listen_ers> toatt on teh first box goes thru the suggestion then blanks
[19:34:50] <listen_ers> but you should have , "action!" and "'nother action!" below actoint for a brief duration
[19:34:53] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yes, please chew your food before swallongi
[19:34:56] <TsundereNoises> you are not a snake
[19:35:03] <listen_ers> im not sure what yours is doing
[19:35:08] <listen_ers> but i didnt write it
[19:35:12] <listen_ers> glad i found it you can bet
[19:35:14] <TsundereNoises> snake is allowed to eat whatever he wants without chewing, he can just unhinge his jaw
[19:35:15] <isekaijin> listen_ers: Yes, it autocompletes what it already knows, assuming you typed an exact prefix.
[19:35:18] <amigojapan> Thanks TsundereNoises 
[19:35:35] <listen_ers> wait whats the difference between a prefix rather then a whole book title?
[19:35:45] <isekaijin> listen_ers: You might write a book title wrong.
[19:36:03] <listen_ers> and the first recommendation comes up with the closest guess!!!!
[19:36:07] <isekaijin> If you write a book title slightly wrong, Google still figures out what you meant, most of the time.
[19:36:21] <isekaijin> If you write a book title wrong, especially near the beginning, then this thing is useless.
[19:36:34] <listen_ers> see i dont understand that portion
[19:36:38] <amigojapan> Ok guys time for me to sleep. Oyasumi nasai minnasan
[19:36:44] <listen_ers> cause i could make a hella lotta use for this for that exact case
[19:36:53] <isekaijin> amigojapan: cya
[19:36:59] <listen_ers> well the arranging isnt there
[19:37:03] <amigojapan> Ty isekaijin 
[19:37:08] <listen_ers> but obviously thats the functionality thats need to be put in
[19:37:26] <listen_ers> i guess im just too hype for it
[19:37:32] <isekaijin> listen_ers: I'm saying that a useful autocomplete in the presence of typos is actually hard to implement, and a UI library or framework is not likely to provide it for you.
[19:37:39] <TsundereNoises> „ÅäË™ïÁîüÊó•„Åä‰ºë„Åø
[19:37:52] <isekaijin> But, well, if you disagree, then let's agree to disagree.
[19:38:10] <listen_ers> no i see i wasnt clear about where yo uwere coming from thats all
[19:38:21] <listen_ers> i thought you thought it was completely useless as to learning how
[19:38:32] <isekaijin> Oh, no.
[19:38:38] <isekaijin> For learning purposes it is certainly useful.
[19:39:01] <listen_ers> but yea
[19:39:04] <listen_ers> i see
[19:39:34] <listen_ers> the different word example is the primises of actually somehow thinking matching closer and closer to the string if even possible to implement in this example
[19:39:51] <listen_ers> i did just find it :p
[19:39:51] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: Êú¨ÂΩì„Å´„ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ!

[19:41:09] <listen_ers> also notice in the first box the functionality of text replacing is there so thats good
[19:41:35] <listen_ers> the second box does just demonstrate wild suggestions
[19:41:54] <listen_ers> so if you had good momentum into programming it it could possible
[19:41:56] <Satin> a
[19:43:03] <isekaijin> I think eventually Satin could do better than just matching prefixes, though.
[19:43:20] <isekaijin> Some heuristics could work, like ‚Äújust look at the two longest words‚Äù.
[19:43:45] <isekaijin> But for the time being, it is probably better for Satin to just focus on learning GTK.
[19:44:02] <listen_ers> for me its first glimpse at the trials of text box and implementations
[19:44:12] <listen_ers> so i dont really have skills to argue
[19:44:26] <listen_ers> just that i stumble on it :p
[19:44:34] <Satin> isekaijin: how complicated is this stuff to you?
[19:44:41] <isekaijin> Satin: I'm no good with UIs.
[19:44:49] <Satin> algo wise
[19:45:13] <listen_ers> well this example too is as good as a how to full of conviction ^^
[19:45:30] * Satin dropped all classes due to PTSD from being shot anyways, and one of those classes was data structures and algorithims this semester
[19:45:44] <isekaijin> Satin: Certainly not easy. Maybe if I do my research (read: googling papers), I can find a workable solution in weeks, but that assumes I have absolutely nothing else to do, wihch is not true.

[19:59:52] <isekaijin> Of course, calculus teachers will give you the bullshit excuse that ‚Äúit trains your brain‚Äù and blablabla, but the hard fact is that most programming doesn't use calculus in any way.

[20:07:20] <Satin> I really enjoyed this, though I haven't gotten through it entirely or anything
[20:07:46] <Satin> but learning a bit about set theory for the first time was "wait so THAT"s what functions actually are"
[20:08:07] <Satin> and I'd like to learn how to actually do math proofs and such
[20:09:11] <isekaijin> Oh.
[20:09:56] <Satin> I'm not great at math or anything, but that stuff was actually fun and I'd like to actually go more into it. 
[20:10:12] <Satin> I also know that calculus in my college classes is frustrating. It's so little on foundational details for how it is developed

[20:10:26] <isekaijin> Yes.
[20:10:37] <Satin> I hate that :(
[20:10:37] <isekaijin> There is nowhere near enough time to develop those tools from the ground up.

[20:13:53] <Satin> don't think we have that here

[20:33:24] <SummerSkies> he made it sound like he wanted a channel and then he never talked again
[20:33:42] <Satin> TsundereNoises: I was supposed to take Calc 2 this semester, and I did, but it was not a normal attempt at all. I wasn't studying, I was bad with stress etc.

[20:34:09] <SummerSkies> you know what TsundereNoises
[20:34:17] <Fenderbassist> maybe he's making an alias to join and observe first

[20:34:32] <TsundereNoises> SummerSkies: or basic deductive reasoning
[20:34:38] <Satin> the algorithims class randomly had math induction stuff but it wasn't that math-ey i think
[20:35:02] <Satin> my interest in discrete math or whatever is more of an interest in learning to read/write proofs and i *feel* it's closer to foundational math theory which is far more interesting
[20:35:09] <Satin> than friggin calculus lulz
[20:35:13] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I get what you mean, I had a summer where I took one of those condensed summer classes and had a lot of other shit going on and what would normally have been an easy enough class got to be really tough and I got a C

[20:37:27] <TsundereNoises> I think we should be judged on our A-game

[20:37:42] <MootPoot> even the cheapest mass produced ones today are still like
[20:37:44] <MootPoot> 30 bucks
[20:37:48] <Satin> TsundereNoises: so there's two ways to go about this. the "normal" way to learning calc and just going along with the coursebooks stuff, or trying to both learn more ""rigorious""  (in reality it's just slightly more rigorious) way with spivak's calculus
[20:37:59] <omero> last time I used a trackball was to play Crystal Castle
[20:38:07] <TsundereNoises> Satin: for what it's worth, I thought discrete was more fun, but Calc is also really fucking important conceptually (and I at least had to do some proofs there, even if it wasn't really a proof-based class)

[20:53:25] <TsundereNoises> technically there was a book, but teacher used it for homework problems and that's it

[20:53:52] <TsundereNoises> Satin: on one hand, my gut says this is making things harder than you really need for calc 2 in college
[20:53:54] <Satin> might try apostol's instead 
[20:54:03] <Satin> TsundereNoises: no, that is literally true
[20:54:04] <Satin> it is
[20:54:08] <HubertFarnsworth> MootPoot: I thought it is named after the relay race

[20:54:21] <TsundereNoises> like you see when you have new relgious schisms
[20:54:26] <Satin> but on the other hand, I'm personally interested in *trying* to step up my understanding of math stuff
[20:54:33] <TsundereNoises> Satin: on the other hand, several of these things seem like things I vaguely remember doing in calc 1
[20:54:36] <Satin> and am frustrated to hell with my college calc classes usually
[20:54:43] <Satin> yeah
[20:54:50] <MootPoot> the best thing I've found is that to fuck math subjects

[20:55:28] <Fenderbassist> HubertFarnsworth: it's a Fenderbassist
[20:55:32] <Satin> as someone pointed out a bit ago, it's because of lack of time to develop these things

[20:55:49] <Fenderbassist> HubertFarnsworth: indeed you are, how's things?
[20:55:55] <TsundereNoises> Satin: so is your plan to like self-teach calc and then take the class to get the check mark on your record?
[20:56:14] <Satin> TsundereNoises: yes, but I know that's not actually going to happen unless i entirely commit over the next few weeks
[20:56:22] <HubertFarnsworth> Fenderbassist: It's okay. I made almost double the money in 15 days and haven't done much.
[20:56:30] <Satin> but i also don't have any classes and i'm at home and everyone else is gone for winter break soon so

[20:57:11] <MootPoot> not really relavant but 
[20:57:17] <TsundereNoises> Satin: well I mean it seems like a good enough book, I'm just wondering if it's not significantly less doable for you in this timeframe than an easier book which might get you the same results in the end
[20:57:20] <Satin> TsundereNoises: but my problem is I also don't want to focus too heavily on rigorious calculus either, it's interesting, but "foundational math" stuff seems more interesting

[20:57:53] <MootPoot> the chapters are like 60% history lecture and 40% math excercise
[20:57:54] <Fenderbassist> things have been pretty much like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyKU29v-JLg , just finding little enjoyments while getting stuff done

[20:58:08] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I actually get really frustrated with how many textbooks are written anyway, but that's another topic
[20:58:10] <Fenderbassist> back into lifting again, really enjoying that
[20:58:12] <MootPoot> like "the bablylonians did X Y Z to discover this math thing, now follow along with me and you'll work it out on paper"

[20:59:35] <Urchin[emacs]> at least the babylonians had the sense to pick a number base most convenient for division
[20:59:45] <Satin> TsundereNoises: also as you can see I'm doing that thing where I'm talking about what I want to do rather than actually doing it
[20:59:48] <TsundereNoises> Satin: as you'd see from the other book though, calc isn't that removed from analysis, which is also underlying all this stuff
[20:59:54] <HubertFarnsworth> Fenderbassist: reading, a lot of reading
[21:00:04] <Poeticode> Satin lol I love how much of a flop Maplestory 2 was. Like yo, it being a 2d platformer is what made it dank
[21:00:06] <Fenderbassist> reading is awesome, I try to get some every day, glad you're keep it up
[21:00:10] <Satin> TsundereNoises: but my end end end end goal is "GIT GUD AT MATH PROOFS AND MORE RIGIROIOUS MATH" 
[21:00:15] <TsundereNoises> Satin: and yeah, a lot of this seems like distraction, and like a distinction that is maybe more in your head than you think
[21:00:29] <Urchin[emacs]> calc is a subset of analisys
[21:00:30] <TsundereNoises> Satin: you will have to git gud at proofs for every math class ever
[21:00:34] <Urchin[emacs]> *analysis 
[21:00:35] <Satin> TsundereNoises: not true
[21:00:42] <HubertFarnsworth> Fenderbassist: the hard part is getting rid of distractions 
[21:00:44] <Satin> at least not in my generation tsuntsun
[21:00:50] <Satin> calc 1 had close to no proofs
[21:00:54] <Fenderbassist> yeah that's an important life skill
[21:00:58] <Satin> i didn't see any proofs thrown at me in calc 2  either
[21:01:00] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I guess I believe you, I never took it in college
[21:01:03] <Satin> before i stopped going to class
[21:01:03] <HubertFarnsworth> yup
[21:01:12] <TsundereNoises> but there's plenty of stuff you should prove
[21:01:13] <Urchin[emacs]> universities here just start with real analysis, calc is sometimes covered in high schools
[21:01:19] <Satin> and there's other classes at this school that i'll take that require *some* proofs
[21:01:26] <TsundereNoises> like I feel like how integrals work makes more sense if you go through the proofs for some of it
[21:01:27] <Satin> but they're not hardcore focused on it or anything, and it's like, one single class.
[21:01:34] <Satin> TsundereNoises: yes, and they do not do that here
[21:01:38] <MootPoot> Am I on /ignore or something
[21:01:42] <Satin> MootPoot: yes
[21:01:47] <MootPoot> ...
[21:01:50] <Fenderbassist> MootPoot: I hope not
[21:01:50] <HubertFarnsworth> Fenderbassist: are you still working out? I remember you going to gym everyday
[21:01:56] <MootPoot> Satin: the book I linked literally has what you want 
[21:01:57] <TsundereNoises> Satin: anyway, I think the class where I got the most practice at proofs was either real analysis or linear algebra
[21:02:00] <Satin> MootPoot: that's why Urchin[emacs] responded to your comments on babblyon
[21:02:01] <MootPoot> Like that image 
[21:02:05] <MootPoot> He did ?
[21:02:08] <Fenderbassist> not every day, but I am doing free weights again
[21:02:11] <Satin> TsundereNoises: amazing
[21:02:14] <Fenderbassist> I'm getting old, I need more recovery time
[21:02:15] <TsundereNoises> I guess you could focus on problems for linear algebra, but it was like 75% proofs from the prof I had
[21:02:22] <Satin> MootPoot: are they on your ignore list???
[21:02:32] <HubertFarnsworth> ouch Fenderbassist, take care mate
[21:02:52] * MootPoot grumbles
[21:02:54] <Fenderbassist> I take very good care, lots of supplements, very clean food, plenty of water, no junk food
[21:03:08] <Fenderbassist> maintaining muscle mass
[21:03:11] <HubertFarnsworth> nice
[21:03:14] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I realyl kind of want to find my old notebooks
[21:03:22] <Satin> TsundereNoises: üëÄ 
[21:03:22] <TsundereNoises> Satin: do you need to retake calc 1, or just starting calc 2?
[21:03:29] <Satin> technically retake calc 2
[21:03:31] <MootPoot> There was no ping 
[21:03:35] <MootPoot> Not sure if he did 
[21:03:42] <Satin> but practically, i didn't even try calc 2
[21:03:44] <Satin> this semester
[21:03:48] <MootPoot> Ot it was conincidental
[21:03:54] <Satin> i just stopped going to class or dozing off into dealing with PTSD hell
[21:03:55] <TsundereNoises> so basically start from scratch because you put in 0 effort
[21:03:55] <Fenderbassist> would freak out the last band's guitarist when I would carry his PA bass bins in each hand
[21:03:57] <Satin> yes
[21:03:59] <Satin> exrctly
[21:04:03] <Fenderbassist> he couldn't carry one, he never works out
[21:04:10] <SummerSkies> alright this fukcin psychic guy is getting old
[21:04:14] <SummerSkies> Im' happy he didn't join here
[21:04:27] <Fenderbassist> and we are both old men lol
[21:04:38] <HubertFarnsworth> lol SummerSkies, which psychic guy?
[21:04:47] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I mean if your university isn't even talking about proofs, I guess I agree with you, just this book seems kind of overkill?
[21:04:56] <Satin> TsundereNoises: you're absolutely correct
[21:04:59] <Satin> it is overkill
[21:05:05] <Satin> and I want it to be overkill
[21:05:24] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I just worry it might be too much overkill, it's a long and dense book and you have a relatively short period
[21:05:31] <MootPoot> Funnily enough I got that book at the salvation army / goodwill shack 
[21:05:33] <MootPoot> Lmao
[21:05:37] <MootPoot> For 2 dollars 
[21:05:38] <Satin> TsundereNoises: did you read that stackexchange answer btw?
[21:05:41] <MootPoot> Best 2 dollar book
[21:05:44] <TsundereNoises> and it seems like a decent amount of it isn't really there to have much to do with what you'll learn in calc 2
[21:05:46] <TsundereNoises> at a glance
[21:05:49] <TsundereNoises> haven't gone in much yet
[21:06:03] <Satin> Commonly mentioned alongside Spivak is another "rigorious" textbook by Tom Apostol
[21:06:07] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I have like 5 things open about this right now and I was going to do something else
[21:06:10] <TsundereNoises> I might have lost it
[21:06:10] <Satin> and I might try that now
[21:06:13] <Satin> oh
[21:06:19] <TsundereNoises> oh yeah, I did see that
[21:06:31] <TsundereNoises> Satin: take a look at how long it is, and how dense it is to read
[21:06:36] <Satin> the last few times I went over reading about the landscape in terms of textbooks i ignored it
[21:06:41] <Satin> thinking spivack was just better
[21:06:50] <TsundereNoises> I mean sometimes books need to be dense to teach anything, but they can also smooth things a bit
[21:06:55] <Satin> but now this guy's description of it being more easier at first, more nicer, and more computer science oriented
[21:07:01] <Satin> is making me want to check it out
[21:07:06] <TsundereNoises> I say at least take a look
[21:07:11] * Satin is currently on a forbidden site to uh, obtain, uh,, things, totally legally
[21:08:34] <TsundereNoises> textbook publishing is a scam anyway
[21:08:42] <Satin> TsundereNoises: I hate pearson.
[21:08:51] <Satin> I hate cengage
[21:08:55] <MootPoot> I hate pears
[21:08:57] <Satin> I hate McGraw
[21:09:08] <MootPoot> so you're okay with the hill part?
[21:09:11] <Satin> I hate companies that publish "7th edition" just to change things slightly up to charge 
[21:09:13] <TsundereNoises> Satin: all my worst textbooks were ones that had unneeded 14th editions just adding in more junk
[21:09:16] <Satin> MootPoot: lol
[21:09:24] <Satin> MootPoot: yea HIll is fine.
[21:09:26] <TsundereNoises> often the changes make the writing worse
[21:09:27] <Satin> Fuck McGraw /s
[21:09:35] <SummerSkies> HubertFarnsworth: there's this big shot in another channel I'm in 
[21:09:42] <SummerSkies> wanting to do readings or something
[21:09:42] <MootPoot> fortunately I only had to buy one expensive book for my enture double degree time at my  uni
[21:09:42] <Satin> TsundereNoises: I know right.
[21:09:45] <MootPoot> which was like 
[21:09:47] <MootPoot> 120 bucks
[21:09:49] <MootPoot> I was so mad about it
[21:09:52] <MootPoot> lol
[21:09:56] <Satin> MootPoot: fucking lucky canadian b-
[21:09:57] <SummerSkies> that channel was dead so he asked for an active one so I said here and he never joined
[21:10:03] * Satin seethes in american
[21:10:08] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I should find my organic chem textbook and transcribe a page for you, it's maybe the worst written textbook I've ever seen
[21:10:11] <SummerSkies> and now he just had to do a long ass reading on the 1 person to talk to in the channel 
[21:10:13] * Satin has spent $400 etc before just on textboks for a semester
[21:10:15] <TsundereNoises> like at an english sentence level
[21:10:18] <SummerSkies> and he's just going on saying the same shit over and over again 
[21:10:18] <Satin> MootPoot: FUCK IT ALL
[21:10:26] <HubertFarnsworth> SummerSkies: He would get eaten alive here
[21:10:32] <Satin> TsundereNoises: oh god. STEM people being bad at English.
[21:10:33] <SummerSkies> that's kinda why i did it
[21:10:36] <Satin> but it's the textbook...
[21:10:46] <Cryowolf> dont suppose anyone here happens to own the TCL C825 television?
[21:10:47] <Satin> instead of the students...
[21:11:00] <MootPoot> Satin: funnily enough the more of a "traditional" area I went to ( when I did my business degree) that was the only place that made me buy that cringe book
[21:11:03] <MootPoot> lmao 
[21:11:06] <Satin> lmao
[21:11:06] <MootPoot> to top it off
[21:11:15] <MootPoot> the book HAD the exams and test in it
[21:11:18] <MootPoot> so you had to buy it 
[21:11:21] <MootPoot> I didnt even know
[21:11:27] <MootPoot> until like after the first test
[21:11:35] <TsundereNoises> I feel like not writing your own exams and just taking them out of a book is such a cop-out
[21:11:36] <MootPoot> the test were on that cringe mcgraw website
[21:11:52] <TsundereNoises> no one who really cares completely agrees with what any given book wants to test on
[21:12:15] <MootPoot> Satin: guess how much student loan I have~
[21:12:17] <MootPoot> or well

[21:24:14] <TsundereNoises> I probably need to expand on that
[21:24:17] <TsundereNoises> not sure if I'm up to it

[21:27:19] <TsundereNoises> such wonderful disdain
[21:27:20] <Satin> but aside from that frustrations 14 year old me felt suddenly a sense of "wtf this is cutting edge bugs and issues... and  look what I'm dealing with"
[21:27:21] <MootPoot> not really with you
[21:27:31] <Satin> and I usually learnt a lot about what was actually going on

[21:33:19] <MootPoot> some affiliate ocmpany with asus made it
[21:33:26] <Satin> and now a last opportunity to study all of these things
[21:33:26] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I find this with almost everything, when things are interrelated, it often helps to have some clue about all the parts before going into huge depth on one, but it's really hard to teach that way
[21:33:31] <Satin> before next semester starts
[21:33:41] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: I got arch running on it but I have to complete the normal install

[21:36:43] <sscout> well, she probably wants off twitter too but its her professional one
[21:36:46] <MootPoot> its just me being retarded and not knowing how to linux
[21:36:51] <ButterNoodle> yea its something distro/image specific
[21:36:55] <Satin> TsundereNoises: but at this point, I've accepted that even if I don't do well with my opportunity, I'm not going to beat myself up entirely and just accept it too, maybe.

[21:41:43] <Satin> taht's true
[21:41:43] <TsundereNoises> Satin: in the next few weeks I'm in a place where I have both not a lot I HAVE to do, but a good amount of time to work on things I want to do for me
[21:42:03] <TsundereNoises> Satin: so if you ever want a buddy to like work on stuff at the same time through the power of peer pressure, I could be up for that
[21:42:14] <TsundereNoises> obviously DIFFERENT stuff, but I still think it can help sometimes
[21:42:14] <Satin> yesyes for sure
[21:42:48] <Fenderbassist> she's a smooth player
[21:42:49] <Satin> i think it's about balance, if you go over the edge and are too self critical with no acceptence, it's stiffling. on the other end you also want to do things, in the first place and give them your best shot
[21:43:20] <TsundereNoises> I tend to stall a lot on getting started BECAUSE of that self-criticalness
[21:43:27] <Satin> TsundereNoises: personally for me a big one is giving myself permission to just do imperfect things, and to also focus more on this idea that my attempt is my messy, complicated, not great "performance" of it

[21:44:07] <Satin> TsundereNoises: we're very similiar in some ways lol

[21:44:31] <TsundereNoises> yes
[21:44:33] <Satin> yes LMAO
[21:44:38] <MootPoot> I reframed everything from "I have to succseed at X" or "I have to make X good" or goals like that to simply "my goal is to try doing X"
[21:44:39] <TsundereNoises> we both score well on that neurotic scale thing

[21:44:50] <TsundereNoises> in your face!
[21:44:53] <Satin> haha
[21:45:19] <MootPoot> so no matter what I do , I technically win 100%
[21:45:23] <MootPoot> since I only have to try
[21:45:24] <MootPoot> thats it
[21:45:27] <TsundereNoises> I think what I get most hung up on are when I'm stuck on a thing that's like a prereq to a prereq to the thing I really want to do
[21:45:31] <Satin>  life is a negotiation, not a rat race!! it's okay to do imperfect work, and have your own, performance, give yourself permission to play and messily live in the moment
[21:45:38] * Satin tells that to herself aswell

[21:46:46] <Satin> MootPoot: yeah that's somewhere where i've landed too, it took a long while
[21:46:54] <Satin> and it's a process, but i feel much better than before
[21:46:57] <MootPoot> it didnt really fix the problem 
[21:47:02] <MootPoot> I still think everything I do sucks
[21:47:03] <MootPoot> etc
[21:47:05] <MootPoot> I dont know enough
[21:47:06] <Satin> it's better than the alternative
[21:47:09] <MootPoot> or I'm dumb
[21:47:09] <Satin> MootPoot: but ur trying
[21:47:11] <Satin> and thato's what matters
[21:47:13] <Satin> MootPoot: same
[21:47:14] <MootPoot> but its a big enough bandaid
[21:47:19] <MootPoot> that I can do stuff
[21:47:29] <MootPoot> since its so easy to hit that "just try" metric
[21:47:39] <Satin> :)
[21:48:04] <MootPoot> so as far as I'm convinced, I'm sucsessful at 100% of the things I do
[21:48:19] <Satin> hehe
[21:52:50] <TsundereNoises> what bothers me most isn't when I can't figure something out, it's when I fail at something that I know I'm 100% capable of
[21:52:59] <TsundereNoises> and that has been happening a lot in the last few years
[21:53:19] <Fenderbassist> TsundereNoises: sometimes you have to take a step back and rest/recover
[21:53:31] <Fenderbassist> trust me, in the advancing years you will experience that again :)
[21:53:34] <TsundereNoises> especially with things where the overall goal is kind of nebulous and so you need specific sub-goals and then fail at those sub goals, it leaves everything feeling pointless sometimes

[23:04:38] <Satin> Jk
[23:05:03] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: I'm into more things but that's just indirectly what I can think of, I'm a very meta person
[23:05:20] <Satin> and that's not supposed to be patting myself, it's actually sad
[23:05:29] <Satin> cursed with knowing the landscape but rarely any depth
[23:06:09] * Satin is trying to change that by doubling down on programming, actually reading buuks and maybe some math stuff, and then moving onto the next thing
[23:06:14] * HubertFarnsworth is into English Literature, scifi, fantasy novels, writing, british comedies, classics, manga, anime 
[23:07:00] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: nice, I got a stack of used books recently
[23:07:14] <Satin> dorpped like $150 on it, I plan to actually read them as I get a grip on the programming part

[23:07:34] <Satin> yeah nah I dropped that shit early
[23:07:41] <HubertFarnsworth> Satin: you're lucky
[23:07:44] <Satin> I know shakey has value and all, but I'm not ready for that 
[23:08:19] <Satin> and anyways when i got a copy it was some oxford pres something edition and was extra annoying for reasons i can't remember
[23:09:05] <HubertFarnsworth> overall the plots are wild, depressing and somehow revolves around full moons, magic and such
[23:09:07] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: modernist literature is like this nice balance for me
[23:09:13] <HubertFarnsworth> but man, he knows how to write
[23:09:16] <Satin> between amazing stylism, at least from the greats

[23:15:13] <HubertFarnsworth> Satin: It has a female protagonist but that's not the reason why I recommending it. It has this kind of wildness to it, a sense of freedom, rebelliousness. It's something better to read when young. Quite enjoyable 
[23:15:37] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: gotcha :)

[23:48:54] <MootPoot> Either that or their have a vocal tic making it sound like that 
[23:48:55] <Bco1981> MootPoot: it's far from every IT person that uses the pc as much at home. not like us/me that when i get home i run straight to the pc and turn it on.
[23:49:03] <Fenderbassist> they probably don't want to spend their own money
[23:49:08] <Fenderbassist> unless it's for their personal use
[23:49:14] <MootPoot> This person also thinks 100 bucks is too much for a computer 
[23:49:26] <Fenderbassist> they might have the wrong mindset for the field?
[23:49:29] <Bco1981> that person does not know it
[23:49:39] <MootPoot> Somehow managed to get through uni with a netbook running win10
[23:49:43] <MootPoot> Lma0
[23:49:51] <MootPoot> 2011 netbook 
[23:49:52] <Fenderbassist> I saw that very thing when I got my IT degree
[23:50:02] <Fenderbassist> one guy had Windows 7 starter on a netbook
[23:50:05] <MootPoot> I feel like some of them treat IT as a job 
[23:50:08] <MootPoot> Only
[23:50:08] <Fenderbassist> 1 GB RAM
[23:50:14] <Fenderbassist> was sooooo slow
[23:50:16] <MootPoot> Fenderbassist: I'm cringing and relating 
[23:50:22] <MootPoot> That one person asks you for help
[23:50:25] <MootPoot> And you don't want to 
[23:50:34] <MootPoot> Since a 5min thing will take 10 years 
[23:50:46] <Fenderbassist> I tried sharing stuff to help him out via a USB flash drive but it would have taken 3 days for it to copy over
[23:50:56] <Fenderbassist> was USB 2 I think on his machine
[23:51:20] <MootPoot> Just.. Why
[23:51:28] <MootPoot> Like, they've been to a store 
[23:51:28] <Fenderbassist> he didn't own a car, only a bicycle, so in his case probably all he could aford
[23:51:30] <Fenderbassist> afford*
[23:51:33] <Fenderbassist> was a 200 netbook
[23:51:49] <Fenderbassist> my Acer Aspire One netbook ran circles around his
[23:51:52] <MootPoot> Well, in that case I'll give it a pass, but in that case just use the school's computers 
[23:51:55] <Fenderbassist> he probably bought used at a pawn shop
[23:52:09] <MootPoot> This one person wasted 3 hours of the teachers time every day 
[23:52:12] <MootPoot> After class 
[23:52:15] <Fenderbassist> bummer
[23:52:18] <MootPoot> Since helping them doing anything
[23:52:26] <MootPoot> Imaging a video call+screen share 
[23:52:41] <MootPoot> While running visual studio ( full, not vs code ) 
[23:52:47] <MootPoot> On a fucking 2010 netbook
[23:52:47] <Fenderbassist> when I needed help I went to the math lab
[23:52:54] <Fenderbassist> yes the math lab, my dungeon of doom lol
[23:53:06] <Fenderbassist> I don't math well
[23:53:28] <Fenderbassist> yeah that's nuts, VS on a calculator like that
[23:54:08] <Fenderbassist> their choice(s), their consequences, eventually people will tire of it
[23:54:22] <Fenderbassist> seen a number of people like that get fired
[23:54:27] <Fenderbassist> live and learn
[23:55:06] <MootPoot> They originally got it because they had no money, I get that but like 
[23:55:18] <MootPoot> They stuck with it the whole degree
[23:55:24] <MootPoot> At that point
[23:55:29] <Fenderbassist> should have gotten a part time job just to get something better
[23:55:31] <Fenderbassist> imho
[23:55:37] <Fenderbassist> even day labor for one week
[23:55:37] <MootPoot> Just go get a laptop on payments from the school store 
[23:55:40] <Fenderbassist> would have done it
[23:55:41] <Fenderbassist> or that
[23:55:54] <MootPoot> 20 bucks a month , even a 400 dollar computer would be enough
[23:55:57] <MootPoot> Really 
[23:56:04] <Fenderbassist> agreed
[23:56:59] <MootPoot> The funny thing is those same people go on about how macs are so good 
[23:57:06] <MootPoot> And why windows are trash 
[23:57:24] <MootPoot> Bitch - if you paid 1.3k or more for any modern computer it would be good 
[23:57:45] <MootPoot> It's just that apple dosent sell 200 dollar pieces of trash 
[23:57:50] <Bco1981> well... there is a reason for that... if you only pay $100 for your windows pc... and $1200 for your mac...
