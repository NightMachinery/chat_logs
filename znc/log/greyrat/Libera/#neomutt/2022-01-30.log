[02:52:23] <flatcap> dcpurton: sorry about the information overload.  once I get an idea I tend to run with it :-)
[02:57:01] <dcpurton> flatcap: no probs. I think these are the kinds of things that are at the right level for me and fun to work on
[02:57:13] <dcpurton> I now understand the compose code reasonably well
[02:57:19] <flatcap> great :-)
[02:57:23] <flatcap> to both
[02:57:36] <dcpurton> and thinking about things, promoting and demoting attachments won't be so hard
[02:57:47] <dcpurton> so might as well do all the movements you think of
[02:58:01] <flatcap> yeah, I think with the right structures underneath
[02:58:24] <dcpurton> don't worry about #3223 too much just yet. I'll let you know when it's worth having a look at
[02:58:24] <neo-bot> PR by @dcpurton "Support for inserting attachments": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/pull/3223
[02:58:31] <flatcap> sure
[02:58:41] <flatcap> I think we might be able to do it in stages: first add the connectivity to AttachPtr; then strip back Body
[02:59:06] <flatcap> though that might be pointer HELL while we convert
[02:59:16] *** Quits: weirdsmiley (~weirdsmil@203.122.10.222) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[03:00:16] <flatcap> I've been trying to work out what the API would look like -- not much progress yet
[03:00:32] <flatcap> trying to decide all the "pure" attachment functions we'd need
[03:00:34] <dcpurton> Be careful that Body is manipulated elsewhere when there is no AttachCtx present (e.g., in start-up code when supplying attachments on command line)
[03:00:55] <flatcap> oh yes. I'd overlooked that bit
[03:01:17] <flatcap> I _think_ most of the non-compose manipulations are "simple"
[03:01:26] <dcpurton> this does make use of the body->next and email->body structures
[03:01:33] <dcpurton> probably
[03:02:06] <flatcap> quite a few places use Body->next, but I think they'd be happy with an ARRAY
[03:02:18] <flatcap> but... more investigation is needed
[03:03:46] <flatcap> we just need to find the right place to break into this problem

[18:53:51] <bitigchi> > replied to listedeyEv
[18:54:13] <bitigchi> "that's being replied to listed"
[18:55:04] <bitigchi> no idea what this means :)) I better not indulge myself in translating it I guess
[18:55:46] <flatcap> the config one-liner doc says:  Add 'X-Comment-To' header that contains article author
[18:56:08] <bitigchi> so, like a fancy cc?
[18:56:26] <flatcap> possibly, yes
[18:56:34] <flatcap> probably for display purposes only
[18:57:17] <bitigchi> probably. and if I understood it right, FollowUp-To is also kind of a to-do kind of cc?
[18:57:53] <flatcap> yeah. sounds about right
[18:58:06] <bitigchi> got it. thanks flatcap!
[18:58:12] <flatcap> np
[18:59:21] <bitigchi> doing a line-by-line check with mutt's messages
[18:59:31] <bitigchi> interesting to see how both evolved
[18:59:44] <flatcap> ah!  you have too much free time :-)
[19:00:10] <bitigchi> I'd hate to see too much divergence
[19:00:19] <flatcap> I got rid of a lot of `.`s at the end of lines -- a lot of messages aren't real sentences
[19:00:27] <bitigchi> yes, i've noticed that
[19:00:36] <flatcap> but apart from that, there should be a fair amount in common
[19:01:26] <bitigchi> i saw some nice optimizations on neomutt side, like getting rid of "word%s" patterns, which require quite a bit of creativity to make it sound right 
[19:01:27] <flatcap> one of our devs improved the handling of plurals using ngettext()
[19:01:35] <flatcap> exactly :-)
[19:01:37] <bitigchi> yes, noticed that as well
[19:02:10] <flatcap> if you spot anything that's awkward to translate, do let me know
[19:02:21] <bitigchi> will do, thanks!
[19:02:29] <flatcap> or if you think something could do with a L10N comment
[19:03:03] <bitigchi> some mutt messages have more explanatory comments, would be useful to migrate actually
[19:04:31] <flatcap> sure.  you can create a branch on the neomutt repo:  preferable [devel/DESCRIPTIVE_NAME]
[19:05:00] <bitigchi> added to my todo already
[19:05:03] <flatcap> Reis Radomil is who we thank for ngettext() :-)
[19:05:05] <flatcap> thanks
[19:06:25] <bitigchi> what's the policy on sending patches upstream? if I wanted to migrate these optimizations to upstream for instance, what do you deem upstream-worthy?
[19:07:08] <flatcap> er...
[19:07:47] <bitigchi> or upstream is very traditional? :)
[19:07:49] <flatcap> Kevin's fairly reasonable.  we still cooperate for security fixes
[19:08:10] <flatcap> yes, very
[19:08:40] <flatcap> i'm sure they'll be receptive to any patches you wish to send
[19:08:53] <flatcap> (more so, if you don't mention the 'N' word ;-)
[19:09:10] <bitigchi> :)))
[19:10:12] <bitigchi> to be fair, i mostly e-mail in order of apple mail (a very bare-bones ui with everything turned off) -> mutt -> neomutt
[19:10:46] <flatcap> I forgive you :-)
[19:11:19] <bitigchi> ideally, i'd love to see neomutt's optimisations and fixes migrated gradually
[19:11:42] <bitigchi> just for the sake of reducing confusion on which client to select
[19:11:59] <flatcap> years ago, I'd have jumped at the chance to merge our improvements 
[19:12:18] <flatcap> but they really weren't interested
[19:12:53] <flatcap> mutt's code is a steaming pile of ****, but... miraculously it's stable
[19:13:10] <bitigchi> neomutt has more refactoring i presume?
[19:13:17] <flatcap> HELL YEAH!
[19:13:33] <bitigchi> that's most nice
[19:13:38] <flatcap> we've been working really hard to fix the architecture, but we've caused instability along the way
[19:14:30] <bitigchi> i guess that's the same for vim/neovim situation. vim's codebase is improving but still very old, neovim breaks for me every time, so i gave up
[19:14:47] <flatcap> yeah, mutt/neomutt is very similar
[19:14:50] <bitigchi> vim has like 90~% test coverage
[19:14:59] <bitigchi> incredible
[19:15:00] <flatcap> wow, that's impressive
[19:15:24] <flatcap> we have some unit tests that cover a small part of the code
[19:15:30] <flatcap> it's a start
[19:15:56] <flatcap> the big problems lie in breaking up the dependencies in the code
[19:15:59] <bitigchi> not to give any ideas, but maybe pulling a red hat in the future might be reasonable
[19:16:26] <bitigchi> keep one side stable, gradually refactor and unit test
[19:16:38] <bitigchi> the other side is the test bed for new stuff
[19:16:58] <bitigchi> bbl
[19:16:59] <flatcap> we hoped that might be the case early on
[19:17:06] <flatcap> ok, see you later
[19:31:37] <bitigchi> i understand though, if the code works and it's stable, not much difference for the user
[19:32:14] <flatcap> yeah
[19:33:05] <flatcap> our killer feature is notmuch integration -- for power-users with their mail held locally
[19:34:47] <bitigchi> i see, yeah very useful
