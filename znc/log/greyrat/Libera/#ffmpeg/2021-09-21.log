[02:44:20] <splitongop> So I'm getting [Parsed_buffersink_19 @ 0000020c2bc6af40] 100 buffers queued in Parsed_buffersink_19, something may be wrong ...when the concat filter switches to a new source. There is also a jump in the video/audio at the stitch point. I feel like I need to flush the buffersink at the stitch point to see if there are more frames before moving on but just a guess. Any ideas?

[14:45:05] <roxlu> Where do the filters fit in when I'm using the ffmpeg libs to do transcoding? I haven't used the filter api before and atm I would e.g. decode a frame, then scale it and maybe reencode w/o filters; but am I correct that I can simply create a filter graph with e.g. a scaler/decoder/encoder and the graphs creates the scalers/decoder/encoder?
[14:49:19] <JEEB> there's no decoders or encoders in lavfi

[14:57:59] <roxlu> JEEB: ok thanks, I'm trying to understand the data flow. When I have a h264 file and I want to scale it via a filter, would I first read a frame `av_read_frame()` , `avcodec_send_packet()`, `avcodec_receive_frame()` and then pass the `AVPacket` that I received into `filter_encode_write_frame()` ?
[14:58:28] <JEEB> filters deal with AVFrames, not AVPackets
[14:58:34] <JEEB> they deal with raw video or audio
[14:59:26] <roxlu> oh yes I see indeed
[15:00:36] <roxlu> so a use case would be where I want to scale a video (h264) where I first decode, then pass the frames into a filter graph, and write the output via e.g. a muxer
[15:01:55] <JEEB> usual use case is read&demux -> decode -> filter -> encode -> mux&write
[15:02:10] <JEEB> but these things are completely separate from each other as far as libraries go
[15:02:17] <JEEB> you can do whatever the heck before and after filtering
[15:02:25] <JEEB> if you have a weird input that gives you XYZ stuff
[15:02:34] <JEEB> you can then just create a filter chain only
[15:02:47] <JEEB> and then afterwards you can show that filtered output or just pass it onto a completely non-FFmpeg encoder

[15:04:29] <roxlu> ok thanks!
[15:06:43] <roxlu> my goal is to use a vaapi based scaler, for which I have to provide the device and I was wondering how that relates to the filter api? I read in the wiki that you can use `--init_hw_device ...` but what api is used to do this in C
[15:09:29] <JEEB> https://lists.ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/structAVHWDeviceContext.html
[15:09:59] <JEEB> see functions such as https://lists.ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/hwcontext_8c.html#a1cb1f874bb5a0ed7743f9a2b73b47e6e
[15:12:05] <roxlu> thanks! I just saw the `vaapi_transcode.c` in the doc dir! that might be a good start.
[15:12:13] <roxlu> I'm going to setup a basic test

[15:15:29] <JEEB> examples-wise hw-specific filtering seems to be not really there
[15:15:50] <JEEB> the only example of AVHWDevice being mentioned is the hw_decode example
[15:17:26] <JEEB> AVHWFramesContext does exist in the vaapi_encode example, but with a quick look that for some reason does a lot of stuff outside of the FFmpeg VAAPI stuff (unlike the vaapi_transcode example)
[15:18:29] <JEEB> doc/filters.texi does mention AVHWFramesContext tho
[15:18:51] <JEEB> also avcodec.h has plenty of stuff on it libavcodec/avcodec.h
[15:18:53] <JEEB> asdf
[15:20:36] <roxlu> ok thanks, I'll dive into that too
[15:21:05] <JEEB> but yea, libavfilter/{avfilter.h,buffersrc.h} do have references that certain structs have an attribute doing AVHWFramesContext
[15:21:16] <JEEB> the lavc stuff seems to be specific to AVCodecContexts, unsurprisingly :)

[23:23:04] <aphysically> is http:// the protocol I should be using for an output URL? I'm not sure what other options there are, there's unix:// but I want to avoid it to be portable

[23:27:37] <aphysically> no raw:// or text:// or anything hmmm
[23:27:58] <JEEB> people usually just implement their own AVIO thing if they need custom IO
[23:28:10] <JEEB> like my baby's first AVIO thing https://github.com/jeeb/matroska_thumbnails/blob/master/src/istream_wrapper.c
[23:28:39] <JEEB> although to be honest I'm not sure what you're expecting to happen with something like raw:// or text:// ?
[23:28:42] <JEEB> where would it output it?
[23:29:16] <aphysically> oh I probably want just tcp://
[23:29:42] <JEEB> like raw:// or text:// just sound like standard output, but taht's pretty sure not what you're meaning
[23:30:13] *** Trieste_ is now known as Trieste
[23:30:24] <aphysically> I want to capture -progress <filename> in a platform independent way to monitor ffmpeg stuff I open
[23:30:35] <aphysically> I first tried mkfifo and a file, which worked, but it's not portable to windows
[23:30:49] <aphysically> then I tried a numbered pipe, which worked again on linux, but my friend said it threw an error on windows
[23:31:20] <aphysically> so now I"m diving into stuff I've never done before with sockets and opening a socket: socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
[23:31:44] <aphysically> then binding it to a free port on localhost and telling ffmpeg to send progress to http:/that-bind, which worked but I didn't really want to use http
[23:31:55] <aphysically> I think what I really wanted is something like tcp://localhost:port
[23:32:05] <JEEB> let me guess, you're utilizing stdout for data output?
[23:32:54] <aphysically> nah, I just wanted to make this to separate it out from the regular output the user sees
[23:33:00] *** Joins: gioyik (~gioyik@gateway/tor-sasl/gioyik)
[23:33:11] <aphysically> originally I was just parsing the progress with a regex and it worked fine so really I"m just making life hard on myself :)
[23:33:42] <JEEB> well with subprocesses I've done it the "wait until crap gets finished" way with normal python subprocess, as well as asynchronously with twisted
[23:33:58] <JEEB> and basically you would get a callback in the latter each time you got bits over stdout
[23:34:13] <JEEB> since the python thing can hook into the stdout of the subprocess
[23:34:19] <JEEB> just like you can do that for stderr
[23:34:21] <aphysically> https://github.com/GBeauregard/pyffstream/blob/52c63c7d86b0b748778c05a0db405ecc8b91172b/src/pyffstream/ffmpeg.py#L778
[23:34:30] <aphysically> this is the mkfifo solution I was using
[23:34:50] <aphysically> I think this tcp:// thing is working though
[23:35:23] <JEEB> yea but that should be solvable by just plugging into stdout. which is only a no-go if stdout is to be utilized for data output
[23:35:43] <JEEB> also I wonder if such async subprocess stuff is already in modern python3
[23:35:54] <aphysically> https://github.com/GBeauregard/pyffstream/blob/52c63c7d86b0b748778c05a0db405ecc8b91172b/src/pyffstream/cli.py#L342 this is the subprocess call
[23:36:03] <JEEB> twisted just happened to be in like 5-10 years before async was cool
[23:36:03] <aphysically> JEEB: oh, with PIPE:1 you mean
[23:36:25] <aphysically> I thought I tried that and I had some problems that I couldn't solve, but in retrospect I think it might have been deadlock things
[23:36:26] <JEEB> default "-" is stdout
[23:36:44] <JEEB> yea Popen, I remember that thing :P
[23:36:54] <aphysically> right, and ffmpeg normally outputs everything to stderr so it's separate
[23:37:00] <JEEB> well yes
[23:37:04] <JEEB> stderr for human readable
[23:37:07] <JEEB> stdout for parsed stuff
[23:37:11] <JEEB> progress is for parsing
[23:37:12] <JEEB> :P
[23:37:18] <JEEB> or well, machine read stuff
[23:38:05] <aphysically> hmmm, I know a lot more now than when I first was trying stdout (in particular how to use selectors to get I/O from both stdout and stderr without deadlocking or using threads)
[23:38:18] <aphysically> so I could go back to doing that, or I could just use this socket solution
[23:38:41] <aphysically> and asyncio is in stdlib now, but I don't know how to use it at all yet
[23:39:04] <JEEB> but yea, it's really simple to get caught into subprocess making it so that it just whirrs in the background until it finishes
[23:39:14] <JEEB> while twisted kind of forces you into "here's a callback for data on stdout"

[23:39:46] <JEEB> note, I don't especially like twisted but at least that kind of made sense

[23:56:05] <mythos> hiho. I have a little problem understanding the build-options. If I use --disable-everything and use --enable-decoder=h264, enables that a software decoder or just a framework for h264 in general (for instance for --enable-decoder=h264_vaapi)?
[23:56:35] *** Joins: gioyik (~gioyik@gateway/tor-sasl/gioyik)
[23:56:52] <JEEB> I would expect that to enable the full decoder
[23:58:04] <mythos> what would i need to set for only the vaapi h264 decoder?
[23:58:36] <mythos> if that is possible
[23:58:39] <JEEB> that'd be the h264_vaapi hwaccel
[23:58:59] <JEEB> anyways, things may be more complicated but looking at the select line for h264_vaapi hwaccel
[23:59:02] <JEEB> > h264_vaapi_hwaccel_select="h264_decoder"
[23:59:04] <JEEB> that ends up with h264_decoder
[23:59:27] <JEEB> granted, you usually want something else than the decoder/hwaccel only
[23:59:30] <mythos> and that is the full h264 sw decoder?
[23:59:44] <JEEB> it seems so by the configure script, but I would check it out
[23:59:57] <mythos> i have looked at the configure myself and did see that line. that's why i'm asking
[23:00:14] *** Joins: softworkz (~softworkz@185.202.32.197)
[23:00:29] <JEEB> and now I'm being the idiot telling you to check it out and list things through `ffmpeg -decoders` or through the API :)
[23:00:57] <mythos> hehe. that's what i'm already doing :)
[23:01:31] <JEEB> but in any case even if you only need the hwaccel, they base upon a lot of the parsing in the decoder framework
[23:01:31] <mythos> i'm new to building ffmpeg for a special purpose. normally i just enable everything
[23:02:06] *** Quits: gioyik (~gioyik@gateway/tor-sasl/gioyik) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[23:02:07] <mythos> so it's not possible to build a ffmpeg with h264 hw accel only?
[23:02:13] <mythos> without patching it i mean
[23:02:19] <JEEB> you understood it incorrectly what I meant
[23:02:39] <JEEB> and just to note an answer "I do not know", but various places seem to be doing it
[23:02:48] <JEEB> it's just that you need the NAL unit parsing from the decoder for the hwaccel
[23:02:53] <JEEB> since while no actual decoding per se is being done
[23:02:59] <JEEB> the basic NAL units get parsed
[23:03:50] <JEEB> after all, the hwaccels piggy-back on top of the base decoding framework, but you don't need the whole shebang
[23:03:52] <mythos> hmm... i have seen, that there is also a h264parser traget
[23:04:00] <JEEB> that's kinda separate
[23:04:59] <mythos> just one more question: witch file/dirtree is the h264 sw decoder?
[23:05:08] <JEEB> libavcodec/h264dec.c is the base file
[23:05:16] <JEEB> you can see at the bottom of it there's the AVCodec definition
[23:05:22] <JEEB> you can see how the hwaccels get plugged in there
[23:05:38] <JEEB> so you need the decoder as a component for the hwaccels
[23:05:39] *** Joins: cosimone (~user@2001:b07:ae5:db26:c24a:d20:4d91:1e20)
[23:05:50] <JEEB> but it just sends slice decoding out to the hwaccel
[23:06:53] <mythos> great. then i should be able kill the sw decoder. just so it can't work without vaapi
[23:07:06] <JEEB> you can see all the avctx->hwaccel checks for example
[23:07:20] <mythos> many thx!
[23:09:57] <mythos> thx, your explanation is really helpful
[23:10:50] <JEEB> I do wonder if anyone attempts to build a no-actual-slice-decoding-included lavc h264dec, or do they just utilize the parser and then duplicate all the metadata etc NAL unit handling
[23:10:56] <JEEB> sounds messy :P
[23:11:21] <JEEB> since if you look into h264dec, there's a /lot/ of stuff that isn't directly related to slice decoding
[23:11:36] <JEEB> parameter set parsing, various SEI messages etc
[23:12:26] <mythos> hehe. you know how it is: copy&paste is the programmers friend&devil
[23:12:48] <JEEB> no, I mean: that stuff kind of has to be in a decoder. of course it's in another file etc
[23:13:05] <JEEB> since the decoder is the thing reading metadata etc off of the NAL units that are presented to it
