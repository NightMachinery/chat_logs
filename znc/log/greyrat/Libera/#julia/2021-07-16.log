[06:23:06] <mikko> i think the examples here could use some explanation https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/numbers/#Base.Math.significand
[06:23:32] <mikko> i've spent the past 30 minutes trying to figure out what's the significance of dividing significand by the number itself and mul.tiplying it by 8 :D

[08:41:25] <mikko> good catch on the negative numbers, i didn't even think of that
[08:43:22] <mikko> that 2^3 change is helpful, but maybe exponent() function should also be mentioned as i think that's where the magic number 3 comes from?
[08:44:39] <mikko> as an aside, now that i've figured out how that works i find it weird that significand returns a normalized float rather than the original integer
[08:59:49] <^[> I didn't want to clutter the examples too much by introducing the exponent function, but maybe that would've been better.
[09:00:18] <^[> Hopefully someone who reaches for the significand function will be aware that there's an exponent as well.
