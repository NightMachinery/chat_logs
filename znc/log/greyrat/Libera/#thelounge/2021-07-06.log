[03:33:31] <Snuupy> yes you can do a cross compile yourself phisch

[03:34:31] <phisch> Snuupy: i just did (https://hub.docker.com/r/phisch/thelounge) but i was hoping there was an official image. hopefully they build an arm/v6 one in the future
[03:34:49] <Snuupy> ah
[03:35:00] <Snuupy> I'm not too familiar with cross compiling, I just know it's a thing
[03:35:08] <Snuupy> how do you get x86 to build armv6 or v7?
[03:35:13] <Snuupy> like, what's the command for it
[03:35:19] <Snuupy> maybe you can do a PR
[03:36:02] <phisch> check out this article: https://www.docker.com/blog/getting-started-with-docker-for-arm-on-linux/
[03:36:05] <phisch> start at "Register Arm executables to run on x64 machines"
[03:36:10] <Snuupy> ah
[03:36:27] <Snuupy> thanks
[03:36:27] <phisch> you basically get a container that can build arm images
[03:36:35] <phisch> and then build images inside that container
[03:36:47] <phisch> it's pretty easy following this article
[03:38:17] <Snuupy> I have to look into it, I plan to move my thelounge instance from an x86 VPS to an ARM VPS lol

[03:39:51] <phisch> the official thelounge image does work on arm v7, only v6 is an issue, and you can just use mine until they provide an official one, i intend to keep it updated until they do, and remove it once they do
[03:40:03] <Snuupy> I don't need armv6
[03:40:10] <Snuupy> I have to check the arch on the oracle cloud VPSes
[03:40:24] <Snuupy> and I have to make mods to the official image anyway for a few things
[03:40:41] <Snuupy> would rather just pull from git repo and build my own

[12:51:35] <phisch> and when you support gifs, people want to record their whole screen at 60 fps with it for 3 minutes and then wonder why encoding it takes 2 hours and the file is 7GB large

[18:59:15] <Jay2k1> but yes, it's in the code
[19:00:06] <bookworm> what's in your default config on the running instance?
[19:01:13] <bookworm> the logic is that it merges the user config (the thing in /etc or whatever) with the default (/usr/lib or whatever) and warns if they aren't in the object stored in /usr/lib
[19:01:38] <bookworm> as in, if you have a key in the user config that isn't already in the defaults
[19:01:52] <bookworm> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/blob/fa854fde786a0dc8c91bcecfa3e9bfd3284a7a0a/defaults/config.js#L160 <-- the defaults should contain it
[19:05:02] <Jay2k1> it does... weird

[19:06:28] <bookworm> do you run it via yarn directly?

[19:07:36] <Jay2k1> i do... for ages, to upgrade i do git diff > mychanges.patch; git stash; git pull; patch < mychanges.patch, yarn && NODE_ENV=production yarn build

[19:18:41] <bookworm> but then it really should use the local version... not like there's an install step in between

[20:45:36] <FloridaMan> is there any "hook" system, or a good place for me to place hook code for things in the codebase? I want to try to build out an MQTT hook to send highlights and direct messages to an MQTT broker in my spare time if I can
[20:50:10] <bookworm> FloridaMan: not for this usecase no. There's some hooks for plugins, but message receive hooks aren't part of it. That is to say the plugin API gives you low level access to the client, so you can do whatever. Consider this unstable though and subject to change
[20:50:36] <FloridaMan> OK I guess I'll just hold off then
[20:50:51] <bookworm> well you can just patch the source itself
[20:51:00] <bookworm> not as nice for sure, but workable
[20:55:27] <FloridaMan> bookworm: it's not too big of a deal really. I have a Node-RED setup that allows MQTT messages to be read aloud from my Google Home and it would be nice to have it announce when I have highlights and mentions
[20:55:34] <FloridaMan> but it's not worth too much effort tbh
