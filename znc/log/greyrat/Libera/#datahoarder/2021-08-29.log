[10:28:22] <cluelessperson> Question, how do you all manage permissions in your directories and on your servers?
[10:28:46] <cluelessperson> I find myself writing a script to set specific ownerships and permisssions for specific directories across the board
[10:28:58] <cluelessperson> and I can just run that or reference that if I'm ever manually modifying anything.
[10:30:05] <NiLon> not sure what the question is actually about
[10:30:27] <rmmh> I don't have any other users on my machines, so it's quite simple
[10:30:29] <NiLon> first question would be that why would you need to manage them in the first place
[10:30:47] <rmmh> my user owns everything other than root's crap in /. simple.
[10:31:58] <cluelessperson> I see, so it sounds like you don't bother.
[10:32:30] <cluelessperson> well since I cannot verify all the software that might potentially run on my servers, I try to isolate services and their permissions and allowed directories as much as possible.
[10:33:03] <cluelessperson> every service runs as its own user/group which only has access to specific directories to read/write.
[10:33:23] <cluelessperson> I feel the only realistic way to improve security is by engaging in like, SELINUX, but... nah
[10:33:43] <rmmh> firejail is a simpler way
[10:33:44] <unfinity> ・゜゜・ ​ 。。・゜゜\_0​< qu​ack!
[10:33:46] <rmmh> ,bang
[10:33:46] <unfinity> WTF?! Who are you, Kim Jong Un firing missiles? You missed. You can try again in 7 seconds.
[10:33:56] <rmmh> ,bang
[10:33:56] <unfinity> rmmh you shot a duck in 11.829 seconds! You have killed 114 ducks in #datahoarder.
[10:34:31] <NiLon> cluelessperson and you don't feel like the defaults are strict enough?
[10:38:37] <cluelessperson> NiLon, sorry, default what?
[10:39:41] <NiLon> default ice cream flavor, what do you think the discussion just were about?
[10:39:57] <NiLon> I already see this being waste of time
[10:40:22] <cluelessperson> NiLon, so you're suggesting run every service as root or my user?
[10:41:37] <NiLon> did I suggest so at any point?
[10:42:00] <cluelessperson> NiLon, frankly you're not communicating well so it's difficult to tell what you're suggesting.
[10:42:23] <NiLon> frankly I didn't (yet) suggest anything at all
[10:42:28] <cluelessperson> "how do you all manage permissions with various services on your systems?"   "use the defaults"
[10:42:29] *** Joins: Darkcoal (~user@139.64.57.138)
[10:42:37] <NiLon> because I have yet to discover your actual and real problem
[10:42:40] <cluelessperson> default permissions are all fucked up.
[10:43:12] <NiLon> I never said to use default
[10:44:05] <NiLon> and that doesn't mean you should or should not
[10:44:27] <cluelessperson> NiLon, It's exactly as I described.    I have ZFS accessed over NFS/CIFS/Samba by various services, VMs, containers, and they all read, write, or execute files.
[10:45:23] <NiLon> right so what is the problem?
[10:45:33] <cluelessperson> So I have directories like  someplace/docker/services/deluge or bitcoin or whatever,  or   someplace/vm1/users/
[10:46:03] <cluelessperson> or    /archive/torrents   or /archive/media
[10:46:17] <cluelessperson> NiLon, the idea is to strictly limit or restrict what various services may access or modify.
[10:46:57] <NiLon> so default permission of 000 and only allow whatever to access?
[10:47:01] <NiLon> what is the problem again
[10:47:20] <cluelessperson> default permission of 000...
[10:47:28] <NiLon> not strict enough?
[10:48:09] <cluelessperson> That would mean no one could even read the contents of those directories, without having root.
[10:48:26] <NiLon> isn't that what you wanted
[10:49:49] <cluelessperson> The question is about how to standard permissions, users, groups for many directories, which you might then come in a year later and move around or have to change or move files around in media and such.
[10:50:00] <cluelessperson> and maintain the overall permission system/scheme across the board.
[10:50:17] <cluelessperson> the closest thing I've been able to find is to write a script that manages permissions for the various directories.
[10:50:21] <cluelessperson> per service.
[10:50:35] <NiLon> 000 is good standard for isolation, I don't see a problem there at all
[10:51:04] <NiLon> "I try to isolate services and their permissions and allowed directories as much as possible."
[10:51:11] <NiLon> isolate as much as possible, done
[10:51:42] <rmmh> if I'm running an untrusted service, docker is usually the easiest way
[10:52:52] <NiLon> problem is that you are trying to make a "standard" without having a clue what you actually want to be done
[10:53:12] <cluelessperson> rmmh, sure, but apart from managing files in volumes for their respective containers, you have to configure docker services to run as specific user/groups and match the directories you intend to use.
[10:53:28] <cluelessperson> NiLon, I feel I've been quite clear.
[10:54:12] <cluelessperson> I guess that only thing I haven't described is that some services *overlap* directories.
[10:55:10] <NiLon> ah yes the classic problem of wanting perfect isolation without isolation
[10:55:45] <NiLon> and now you know why there are permissions in the first place
[10:57:50] <NiLon> only if there would be something like groups where you can set this overlap
[10:58:04] <cluelessperson> the idea is to isolate services as much as *possible*, and only giving them *specific* permissions they need to access files and directories.
[10:58:18] <cluelessperson> Some of those files and directories may be shared, but still their permissions vary per service.
[10:58:42] <cluelessperson> and again, in the case of like, personal media, I may need to manually move things around, but still also keep the intended permission scheme.
[10:59:09] <cluelessperson> For which at the moment, I manage through a script I've tailored to keep the intended permission scheme per service/directories/files.
[10:59:14] <cluelessperson> I'm asking how you manage them
[11:03:28] <NiLon> so I guess there is no problem to be solved
[11:03:42] <NiLon> you have it already figured it all out
[11:07:40] <cluelessperson> I presented something that takes work to manage.
[11:07:45] <cluelessperson> I presented my solution to manage it.
[11:07:55] <cluelessperson> I asked if you all have different solutions.
[11:08:02] <cluelessperson> Don't know what's difficult about the question.
[11:20:00] <Adagio>  
[11:22:00] <Adagio> I'm a bit more lax too, the `docker` user owns everything it needs, but if I found myself needing to manage permissions that extensively I'd reach for config management (I use Salt).
[11:23:58] <NiLon> difficult part is not understanding the problem. You say you want isolation, yet you want everything to access everything. And by everything I mean resonably everything, but yet this resonably isn't defined to anything actual
[11:24:33] <NiLon> if you even would give a scenario you are afraid of, then it becomes much more workable
[11:26:43] <NiLon> I tried to give base surface to work with by asking why defaults are not good enough, there must be a reason
