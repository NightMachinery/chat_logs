[18:08:04] <fat_thor> Hello everyone.  I'm looking to transport an FFMPEG video stream using RIST.  Haven't been able to find any documentation or usage examples online.  Is there a good resource to help me accomplish this?

[18:17:08] <znf> I had to look-up RIST
[18:17:19] <znf> and I haven't found any info on the first page!
[18:17:48] <JEEB> https://code.videolan.org/rist/librist
[18:18:24] <JEEB> I think there was a patch set for librist, not sure if it went upstream yet since it seemed like librist still had some funky spots
[18:18:33] *** Quits: realies (~realies@user/realies) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:18:55] *** Joins: realies (~realies@user/realies)
[18:20:58] <znf> what does it actually do?
[18:21:20] <JEEB> it's a Yet Another UDP based transfer protocol
[18:21:30] <JEEB> I'd say it's kind of on the same market segment as SRT
[18:21:36] <JEEB> (the protocol, not the subtitle format)
[18:23:10] <fat_thor> That's right, JEEB.  SRT and RIST are pretty similar.  I understand SRT is very similar, except that it doesn't seem to support multicast, which I need.
[18:25:02] <JEEB> ok, librist support is in master
[18:25:11] <JEEB> so feel free to build FFmpeg with it
[18:26:42] <fat_thor> thx JEEB, I can look into doing that. I was looking for RIST user documentation
[18:27:41] <fat_thor> although it looks like it's a bleeding edge feature, I understand docs may not exist yet
[18:28:01] <JEEB> https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html#rist
[18:28:10] <JEEB> I mean, in FFmpeg it's just a protocol
[18:28:41] <JEEB> rist:// as the input or output URI
[18:28:42] <JEEB> etc
[18:28:50] <fat_thor> I see what you mean
[18:30:30] <JEEB> basically the URI is passed on to rist_parse_address and off you go
[18:30:46] <JEEB> most likely a multicast IP means multicast, unicast IP means unicast
[18:30:51] <JEEB> although you'll have to check that from librist's side
[18:31:06] <JEEB> since that is what actually implements the protocol
[18:31:27] <fat_thor> JEEB are you an FFMPEG dev?
[18:31:58] <JEEB> I do that too
[18:32:20] <fat_thor> lol cool.  I appreciate the help.
[18:33:03] <fat_thor> I'll play with it and see how it goes.

[19:25:42] <JEEB> if not, then you'd have to pass it over

[21:03:30] <jcelerier> I'm having a little bit of trouble reading a flac file with libav, but it works fine in e.g. vlc, mpv, etc... so it's most certainly my code which is wrong

[21:51:09] <jcelerier> hmm, this example also fails : https://www.ffmpeg.org/doxygen/0.6/api-example_8c-source.html
[21:51:14] <jcelerier> but ffplay reads it
[21:51:42] <jcelerier> this too fails: https://rodic.fr/blog/libavcodec-tutorial-decode-audio-file/
[21:52:30] <JEEB> jcelerier: use examples from under trunk, not 0.6 :D
[21:52:35] <JEEB> if you're going to utilize teh doxygen examples
[21:52:48] <JEEB> https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/examples.html
[21:52:52] <JEEB> check the transcoding example
[21:53:14] <JEEB> or maybe demuxing_decoding if that is good
[21:53:31] <JEEB> I just know transcoding does not skip utilizing existing FFmpeg functionality in order to limit itself to some scope
[21:56:04] <Helmholtz1> JEEB, any idea about my question? ðŸ˜€
[21:56:43] <JEEB> pipe: ?
[21:57:00] <JEEB> since ffmpeg.c actually I think converts "-" into "pipe:"
[21:57:40] <Helmholtz1> JEEB, so this? ffmpeg -i "http://164.68.124.111/espn2.m3u8" -c pipe:1 | ffplay -i -
[21:57:56] <Helmholtz1> but it still doesn't work
[21:58:03] <JEEB> no
[21:58:07] <JEEB> for input in ffplay

[22:00:31] <znf> what do you mean it doesn't work?
[22:00:59] <znf> curl url | ffplay - works
[22:01:11] <Helmholtz1> znf, JEEB https://dpaste.com/EQCNUL4EX
[22:02:05] <znf> ffmpeg -i "http://164.68.124.111/espn2.m3u8" -c copy -f mpegts - | ffplay -
[22:02:48] <znf> -f hls works, too, I believe
[22:02:53] <Helmholtz1> znf, huh...this one works...
[22:02:54] <Helmholtz1> https://superuser.com/questions/322216/how-can-i-pipe-output-of-ffmpeg-to-ffplay
[22:03:02] <Helmholtz1> none of this answers wor
[22:03:31] <Helmholtz1> znf, what is that -f?
[22:03:39] <Helmholtz1> doesn't -c copy moot all conversions?
[22:03:49] <znf> specifies what format ffmpeg should output
[22:04:22] <znf> when unspecified, the output format is decided by the container extension, but because pipe has no extension, you want to specify the format
[22:04:35] <znf> ie: if you put out.mp4 it will write to mp4, out.mkv will write to mkv etc.
[22:04:37] <Helmholtz1> znf, why matroska doesn't work?
[22:04:48] <Helmholtz1> ffmpeg -i input.avi <options> -f matroska - | ffplay -
[22:05:20] <znf> it does work, just not for the formats of your inputs
[22:05:32] <znf> ie: if you transcode, you can do:
[22:05:33] <znf> ffmpeg -i "http://164.68.124.111/espn2.m3u8" -f matroska - | ffplay -
[22:05:46] <znf> but, again, that will transcode to suitable streams for matroska
[22:06:23] <znf> tl;dr - ffmpeg can't put your input streams in a matroska container, and it tells you why:
[22:06:24] <znf> [matroska @ 00000188fc4de840] Error parsing AAC extradata, unable to determine samplerate.
[22:07:01] <Helmholtz1> znf, what would be the *best* option to stream m3u8?
[22:07:07] <Helmholtz1> ffplay itself can play it
[22:07:11] <Helmholtz1> ffplay "$link"
[22:07:17] <znf> depends to what you're "streaming" to
[22:07:28] <znf> not sure what you're actually trying to do there :)
[22:07:48] <Helmholtz1> to play the stream robustly
[22:07:55] <Helmholtz1> can I add a delay somewhere?
[22:07:58] <Helmholtz1> like a buffer
[22:08:07] <znf> probably
[22:08:54] <znf> Not something I ever bothered to do

[22:50:58] <jcelerier> hm, I don't understand - I'm discarding all the streams that do not interest me while decoding with
[22:50:59] <jcelerier> https://paste.ofcode.org/j8URde9ZwyqRvFcQtqafk5
[22:51:08] <jcelerier> yet I still get packets for all the streams
[22:51:24] <jcelerier> what's the point of AVDISCARD_ALL then ?
[22:51:30] <JEEB> yea whether discard does something depends on the demuxer I think
[22:52:01] <JEEB> although there's some global logic in libavformat/utils.c
[22:52:46] <JEEB> jcelerier: try with an MPEG-TS file for example, I wouldn't be surprised if that does the deal :)
[22:52:59] <JEEB> although I would have expected the global code to kind of have done it
[22:53:10] <JEEB> oh well
[22:54:06] <jcelerier> in a lot of cases it worked (e.g. getting only the video from a movie)
[22:54:15] <jcelerier> but here, I have a set of .flac with an embedded cover
