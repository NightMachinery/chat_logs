[03:19:10] <Raziel> T`aZ, "enough light but not too much" for what usecase?
[03:20:18] <Raziel> suicide, I dunno if there's any specifically for C++ jobs. The usual job websites should have C++ jobs. On linkedin you can even filter by C++ or such
[03:22:43] <Raziel> anyway, too much light probably won't be an issue since normally you should be able to just turn them down if it is too much v:
[03:29:34] <suicide> Raziel: Do you know what type of skills with C++ is usually needed?
[03:29:57] <suicide> Is it mostly used for GUI, embedded software, ...?
[03:30:03] <Raziel> suicide, C++ is used in a pretty wide variety of projects, so it can depend quite a bit
[03:30:05] <suicide> I'm trying to build a portfolio based on that
[03:30:15] <Raziel> When it is used for GUI, it's usually gonna be Qt, so knowing that would help
[03:30:40] <Raziel> Embedded software also uses it a lot, POS systems, video games, simulations
[03:31:12] <suicide> Raziel: Do you maybe know which type of projects could be really interesting to attract headhunters?
[03:31:50] <Raziel> It does depend on what kind of thing you'd be looking to get into
[03:32:13] <Raziel> Contributing to open source game libraries, renderers and such, would probably be very useful if you want to get into game or sim dev on the engine/renderer side
[03:33:06] <Raziel> Networking stuff is big as well, so stuff like asio is always good to know about, as well as database interfacing
[03:33:32] <Raziel> Big data processing as well, so stuff like multithreading helpers, intel TBB, OpenMP, CUDA, the stuff that pushes the performance boundaries
[03:35:36] <Raziel> Image manipulation and computer vision is another pretty big one in some manners of projects (robotics and automation), so that's things like OpenCV, Tesseract, etc
[03:36:23] <Raziel> ...so basically, if you don't really have a preference towards a certain niche, there's a lot to "pick" from :p
[03:36:34] <suicide> Raziel: so that's really complicated xD
[03:36:52] <Raziel> well, I doubt there's many positions that would expect you to have deep knowledge of ALL of those
[03:37:07] <suicide> Also I only have a bachelor's degree
[03:37:17] <suicide> So some fields are already closed for me I think
[03:37:54] <Raziel> Eh, not necessarily, it's very rare for positions to ask for master's degrees or PhDs unless they're research or teaching
[03:38:09] <Raziel> they care more about projects/experience usually
[03:38:14] <suicide> Raziel: where are you from?
[03:38:25] <Raziel> Romania :p
[03:38:45] <suicide> Nice then
[03:38:58] <suicide> I'm also in EU and I though they always ask for a master's degree
[03:38:58] <suicide> x)
[03:39:15] <Raziel> Not based on what I've seen :p
[03:39:19] <suicide> Raziel: is it hard to participate to open source projects?
[03:40:04] <Raziel> it depends on the project, but generally it's not really hard per se, it can just be overwhelming to get in one since there's usually no direction as to what you could or should be doing, and limited learning resources pertaining to the codebase
[03:42:45] <Raziel> some are more complex than others so that makes it harder, some are less documented, some have specific requirements about code style or what you can and can't use, so there's quite a few things to account for
[03:42:54] <suicide> Raziel: Are you actually working as a C++ dev?
[03:42:59] <Raziel> yep
[03:43:06] <suicide> What are you doing?
[03:43:18] <Raziel> casino games and related systems
[03:43:19] <Raziel> lol
[03:43:36] <suicide> XD
[03:43:43] <suicide> In C++ :o
[03:43:58] <Zogatribe> casino games? how are you generating random numbers?
[03:44:39] <suicide> XDDDD
[03:45:06] <Raziel> Zogatribe, depends on the use case, but for now within the games I'm just using a stl mt64 v: in other cases we get numbers from a server, while other machiens have hardware rngs installed and we get em from there
[03:45:38] <Zogatribe> how are you seeding it? do you reseed often?
[03:45:45] <Raziel> suicide, yeah, in C++. A lot of vendors went for unity more or less recently, while some still use their older proprietary engines
[03:45:54] <Raziel> I think a few are even still using flash lol
[03:47:53] <Raziel> Zogatribe, it's still in testing phase but the current seeding I normally use is a sseq of a random device and a time since epoch count. And no, I don't normally reseed often since I don't think that would really add much security
[03:48:27] <Raziel> specially considering there's a lot of pseudo-nondeterministic things that also call the rng, so it can be difficult to ever know the step
[03:51:02] <Raziel> Zogatribe, https://wandbox.org/permlink/Td1cxgOWPwmfHDYt nice and simple ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[13:37:09] <Carbonflux> coinbase had a lot of accounts hacked in the past, they just shrugged and blamed the user. 
[13:42:23] <Carbonflux> “We believe we can balance these interests by continuing to support law enforcement efforts while promoting policy frameworks that respect individual privacy,” Coinbase said.
[13:43:20] <Carbonflux> i think they just snagged the coins and those users will never get them back.

[14:13:37] <Carbonflux> personally i decided to put an RFID in my cock as it does like to run off on its own and make trouble. 
[14:14:50] <Carbonflux> i think more people will do the same when they realize how much crime is caused at night when people fall asleep and their cocks start running about.
[14:15:26] <Faux> What's reading the rfid in your cock?
[14:16:11] <Carbonflux> well, mostly it there if the cock gets arrested or run over by a car.
[14:16:28] <Faux> Not as common as the trouble making, presumably.
[14:17:53] <Carbonflux> ya, still, who knows what they get up to, if there really is a public outcry i think many pubs and the like might start putting cock tracking RFID readers in their establishments.
[14:18:29] <Faux> What kinda range can you get of RFID readers? They're practically contact only, right?
[14:18:40] <Faux> Not sure how hygienic that could be.
[14:19:52] <Carbonflux> it depends on signal strength, for many corporate tracking application you can wire up a building with detectors. 
[14:21:10] <Faux> Is that true? Would have thought you'd risk setting fire to the cock if you overdrove it too much.
[14:22:51] <Carbonflux> well, you can use a UHF RFID tag as well
[14:23:00] <Carbonflux> those have a range up to 100 meters.
[14:23:40] <Faux> Ah, okay, we're getting somewhere.
[14:23:56] <Carbonflux> tho those are active tags
[14:24:07] <Carbonflux> for passive tags the range is like 10 meters
[14:24:12] <Carbonflux> which is still ok
[14:24:27] <Faux> 10m theoretical, probably 1m practical, still good enough for e.g. doors.
[14:24:31] <Carbonflux> and you can use reference points to build a map
[14:24:36] <Carbonflux> ya
[14:25:06] <Faux> A lot of companies do this door management stuff with just cameras and person-recognition (i.e. face, clothing, posture, etc.).
[14:25:10] <Faux> Couldn't you do that with cocks?
[14:25:25] <Carbonflux> seems like most building tracking systems use reference points that link to a local node.
[14:25:33] <Faux> (I contracted for one of said companies, for like three weeks.)
[14:26:31] <Carbonflux> cock are kinda small those and they move fast when you they are in undocked mode.
[14:26:51] <Carbonflux> most people don't remember it because they are sleeping.
[14:27:55] <Carbonflux> the rules of course are different for evolved cocks, like Putin's.
[14:28:41] <Carbonflux> they can fly, do magic, even consume souls or crawl in peoples ears and make they say things by hacking their brains.
[14:31:30] <Carbonflux> but ya, i don't think the visual cock recognition software is very advanced right now, its another example of AI bias, clearly.
[14:33:33] <Faux> Someone was working on anus recognition.
[14:33:46] <Faux> https://www.businessinsider.com/scientists-designed-a-smart-toilet-with-butt-recognition-technology-2020-4?r=US&IR=T
[14:34:42] <Carbonflux> that seems more practical, i assume the anal wrinkles are almost as unique as a finger print.
[14:35:32] <Faux> Why wouldn't the veining on a cock be unique? Retinas are.
[14:37:25] <Carbonflux> that might be harder to capture, not all cocks are like Putin's, with its massive throbbing veins that seem to glow with a dark umbra that in a surreal way seems also to be a kind of black light of evil.

[15:03:38] <jotham> he's confusing recorded history with history
[15:03:42] <jotham> because he's a dipshit american
[15:03:49] <Carbonflux> you don't know shit about history.
[15:03:56] <ERROH> he's furious that 'default' is trending in .ru
[15:04:00] <Carbonflux> your just a mouth.
[15:04:12] <jotham> good buddhist values showing through now
[15:04:16] <jotham> please absolutely inform me about the middle east Carbonflux 
[15:04:25] <jotham> and the thousands of years of entire civilisations being wiped out
[15:04:30] <Carbonflux> Buddhism is not about pretending to be nice.
[15:04:36] <ERROH> but i always wanted to love stellaris
[15:04:59] <ERROH> i lack a game that i love and has the visual aspect of being in outer space
[15:05:07] <TCZ> civ -> cyiv
[15:05:18] <ERROH> well, there's ksp, but i don't have time anymoar
[15:05:23] <jotham> i feel that vibe ERROH 
[15:05:31] <Carbonflux> ya i do too
[15:05:44] <Carbonflux> i once thought EVE online might give me that
[15:07:10] <ERROH> anyways, in my very biased opinion if you ever wanna go grand, go paradox
[15:07:21] <ERROH> total war is like fifa of strategy
[15:08:08] <jotham> can i just say, snow piercer is the best scifi show on tv atm
[15:08:59] <jotham> new total war was kinda tempting
[15:09:04] <jotham> but i need a new gpu before getting it
[15:09:14] <jotham> my stupid big ultrawide is hard to drive with my gpu
[15:09:19] <jotham> even though it's a perfectly fine gpu
[15:09:25] <jotham> probably shouldn't have got the nice monitor
[15:09:40] <jotham> even though it's fucking nice for work
[15:09:47] <Carbonflux> i think cloud gaming is going to be the best option for a few years until the gpu market rebalances.
[15:09:49] <jotham> which isn't something you really want to say
[15:10:03] <jotham> yeah i quite often play steam streaming games on my ryzen thinkpad
[15:10:08] <jotham> in bed with my controller
[15:10:11] <jotham> streaming from my pc
[15:10:14] <jotham> and it works good as
[15:10:27] <jotham> laptop has hardware video decoding right
[15:10:30] <jotham> so it barely brakes a swet
[15:10:39] <jotham> and xbox controller is telegraphed back to the pc
[15:10:50] <jotham> good for horse theft auto
[15:11:06] <Faux> HORSE THEFT AUTO
[15:11:10] <Carbonflux> ah, i was wondering about that game
[15:11:14] <Carbonflux> its good?
[15:11:15] <jotham> it's very nice Carbonflux 
[15:11:17] <Faux> Yes.
[15:11:18] <jotham> yeah
[15:11:20] <jotham> it's well made
[15:11:27] <Faux> The keyboard controls are comically awful.
[15:11:32] <jotham> yeah use a controller
[15:11:34] <jotham> it's so worth it
[15:11:39] <Carbonflux> heh
[15:11:44] <Faux> Nah, learn to suffer. It's what keyboard people believe.
[15:12:34] <T`aZ> i played gta 1. you have probably no idea what it means having awful keyboard control
[15:12:36] <jotham> faux is angling to be the first person to impart genital warts over the medium of irc
[15:13:13] <Carbonflux> i tried to play one of those Yakuza games without a controller recently, it was very bad.
[15:13:22] <TCZ> i won doom 1 using only keyboard
[15:13:37] <Faux> Christ.
[15:13:40] * T`aZ HF TCZ 
[15:13:55] <T`aZ> i started using a mouse only in quake2
[15:16:02] <jotham> * using only one keyboard
[15:16:06] <jotham> most pros use two
[15:16:32] <Carbonflux> it just seems like using a controller is somehow a betrayal of PC gaming. 
[15:16:43] <jotham> just means TCZ has no real motor skills
[15:16:56] <T`aZ> lol
[15:17:08] <T`aZ> Carbonflux: indeed, it does have it's use though
[15:17:13] <T`aZ> its*
[15:17:14] <TCZ> jotham, why ppl dont use 2 mices mouses mousines when use pc - 2 hands = 2 mouses
[15:17:29] <jotham> right
[15:17:47] <TCZ> moses
[15:17:59] <jotham> you're gonna trigger these singualr linear pointer device dweebs
[15:18:32] <Carbonflux> ya, i might have to buy a controller soon, i have been playing more games on Luna now and it seems to need it, their controller uses wifi which they claim is a lot faster.
[15:18:33] <TCZ> for example it could be used to rip off enemies like in 2 sides and blood everywhere guts etc
[15:18:51] <jotham> controller games are better with a controller
[15:18:55] <jotham> and it doesn't take much work
[15:18:58] <jotham> just get a wired one if you can
[15:19:02] <jotham> the force feedback is stronger
[15:19:05] <jotham> and they weigh less

[15:22:54] <TCZ> avczxcasdagfasdasfasdf
[15:30:17] <ERROH> do you think those oligarchs who funded uk private schools
[15:30:33] <ERROH> do you maybe think they also put some money into the leave campaign?
[15:30:49] <ERROH> that one was p. close right?
[15:31:16] <jotham> absolutely
[15:32:04] <jotham> useful idiots talking about the decline of westenr values, and how we need a war, and how neo-lib shitbags are all pedophiles
[15:32:11] <jotham> that is 100% valuable to the authoritarian states
[15:32:20] <jotham> and is no way to reform our democracies
[15:32:43] <jotham> it's not even half of societies fault for agreeing with it
[15:32:48] <jotham> it's superficially true
[15:33:03] <jotham> so yes, russia is absolutely telling right wing and left wing retards what to think
[15:33:07] <jotham> so is china and ameirca
[15:33:13] <jotham> and they are all doing it for their own reasons
[15:33:30] <jotham> and we are surrounded by useful idiots 
[15:34:19] <jotham> brexit was totally encouraged by people that could profiteer out of market dischord
[15:34:42] <jotham> anyone that thinks they are being patriotic, or being smart
[15:34:46] <jotham> are being manipulated
[15:34:59] <jotham> it's about looting the entire fucking stock market
[15:35:18] <jotham> i think robin hood just showed us this recently
[15:35:28] <jotham> with citadel floating all the funds for all of the shorts
[15:35:36] <jotham> and it's entirely a dark pool
[15:35:49] <jotham> so citadel both shut it down and also profited stupidly out of it
[15:36:16] <jotham> yes the city of london is propped up by russian billionares
[15:36:22] <jotham> part of me wonders if that's why they even left the eu
[15:36:33] <jotham> cause the swiss and germans were stealing too much of the robber pie
[15:36:45] <jotham> so england wanted to go full robber without the eu
[15:37:07] <jotham> anyone that talks about nationalism or identity or rights for white men
[15:37:15] <jotham> is absolutely bleeding active cancer out of their faces
[15:37:20] <jotham> and has no grasp of the real world
[15:37:30] <jotham> and is just a cry baby idiot
[15:38:35] <MaNI> the main thing the last few years seem to have proven is that everyone on both extremes of the spectrum have a hardon for authoritarianism and will go out of there way to justify/defend it even through extreme congnitive dissonance
[15:39:03] <jotham> that's why i've tried to caution you on paying out our pm
[15:39:13] <jotham> i think the authoritarianism is dangerous
[15:39:19] <jotham> and she's a consensus leader
[15:39:22] <MaNI> like for instance supporting putin even though spending most their life complaining how everything else is communism and bad
[15:39:23] <jotham> and it's very unfashionable
[15:39:26] <jotham> and easy to make fun of
[15:40:29] <MaNI> IDK from the outside some of her actions look kind of authoritarian, like a brief read about those protests the other day she seemed pretty quick to support the police action and condemn the protestors for even being there, but I've only read superficially
[15:40:48] <MaNI> NZ just isn't important enough to warrant enough attention for me to properly understand (sorry not meant as an insult)
[15:40:56] <jotham> depends how the tv is edited right
[15:41:00] <jotham> and who the target audience is
[15:41:04] <MaNI> yeah
[15:41:12] <jotham> 'white woman bad'
[15:41:14] <jotham> is very popular
[15:41:18] <jotham> amongst all classes
[15:41:24] <jotham> including all non white groups
[15:41:28] <jotham> it's got massive traction
[15:41:34] <jotham> 'country run by a karen'
[15:41:40] <jotham> we even hate our own women
[15:42:10] <jotham> can i just reiterate MaNI 
[15:42:14] <jotham> she's a neolib blairite
[15:42:17] <jotham> that's her politics
[15:42:19] <jotham> and it's very bad
[15:42:25] <jotham> but that isn't how the media presents her
[15:42:36] <jotham> so the way we get information is broken
[15:43:01] <jotham> she'd die to ensure your south african compound goes up by 10% a year
[15:43:14] <jotham> and she wouldn't legalise cannibis or abortion
[15:43:18] <jotham> but she's the lib darling
[15:43:21] <jotham> haha
[15:43:23] <jotham> it's very dumb
