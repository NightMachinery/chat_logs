[10:51:23] *** Joins: CoderGuy (~CoderGuy@user/coderguy)
[11:14:06] <CoderGuy> I solved a coding issue earlier that had to do with deleting via a different api, and it got me curious, in c# when you reasign a variable IE List<int> mylist = new List<int>(); mylist.add(1); Console.WriteLine(mylist.Count); //prints 1  mylist = new List<int>(); Console.WriteLine(mylist.Count); // prints 0
[11:14:45] <CoderGuy> so basically reasigning will create a new list & I assume it will delete the old one because it gets replaced with the new one
[11:16:27] <CoderGuy> so I guess, how does C# deal with like removing all the variables that might be inside a class when said instantiated object gets replaced with a new one?
[11:16:40] <moose> The older one, if referenced by nothing else, will eventually be marked for collection by the garbage collector.
[11:16:53] <CoderGuy> ohhh it gets garbage collected interesting
[11:17:03] <moose> Every single object that is created is tracked by the garbage collector
[11:17:16] <CoderGuy> does this not happen in c++?
[11:17:28] <moose> Correct.
[11:17:49] <CoderGuy> so then in something like C++ what do people do to collect all the variables?
[11:18:05] <moose> You implement a destructor or simply use your class like a value type instead of a reference type.
[11:18:18] <CoderGuy> interesting
[11:18:24] <moose> A destructor gets invoked when you explicitly tell the object to die (self destruct, collect, whatever)
[11:18:41] <moose> C# has destructors too, but the garbage collector is the one who calls them.
[11:18:46] <CoderGuy> early on when I was learning how to code, people said garbage collection is really bad, is that true?
[11:18:54] <moose> It depends on what you are measuring badness with.
[11:19:04] <CoderGuy> how bout just efficiency
[11:19:15] <moose> Again, it depends.

[11:19:26] <CoderGuy> um, being able to free up memory and run things quickly
[11:19:27] <moose> Generally speaking, people like managed and garbage collected languages because you don't have to manage memory manually which is error prone if you are not paying attention.
[11:19:42] <CoderGuy> ic
[11:19:47] <moose> And a garbage collector in some instances can manage memory more efficiently than we can by hand.
[11:20:23] <CoderGuy> okay cool, well I was just reviewing this because in the past I just assumed "hey you reassigned the variable that thing is gone" but I guess this whole time stuff has been getting gc'd
[11:20:39] <moose> It will get GC'd eventually yes.
[11:20:51] <moose> The common implementation is what is known as a generational garbage collector.
[11:21:03] <CoderGuy> and then in the off hand language I was using, that wasn't exactly happening and the weird solution was I have to set an attribute for it to happen
[11:21:41] <moose> Which language?
[11:21:48] <CoderGuy> it's more of an api thing it's called nodegui
[11:21:53] <CoderGuy> it's a wrapper for QT
[11:22:01] <Inge> MSSQL: any decent shortcuts to expanding a varchar field that .. is used as a PK on a key table and thus is used in a bunch of tables with FK constraints, PK's and indexes (oh yeah, and in many db instances, in some cases with aut-generated names of said indexes)
[11:22:02] <moose> Fun.
[11:22:18] <CoderGuy> but that is interesting why something like C# tends to work better for this
[11:22:21] <CoderGuy> it's just setup to do so
[11:22:21] <moose> Inge: Yes, redesign the database and don't use varchar as a primary key.
[11:22:36] <Inge> moose: thank you for your valuable input,Cpt. Obvious :D
[11:22:39] <moose> <3
[11:22:44] <moose> I will think for a moment now and see if I have an idea...
[11:23:11] <moose> When you talk about "expanding a varchar field" what do you mean specifically?
[11:23:16] <CoderGuy> wait what should he use?
[11:23:22] <Inge> just enlarging it
[11:23:28] <moose> Inge: Oh, like resizing the column?
[11:23:30] <Inge> yeah
[11:23:36] <moose> How many records are in the running DB?
[11:23:39] <Inge> varchar(x) -> varchar(x+y)
[11:23:46] <moose> Are we talking thousands or millions?
[11:23:57] <Inge> some customers with a few millions, most with far less
[11:24:26] <Inge> but there are at least 22 impacted tables with actually specified FK relationships
[11:24:53] <moose> Are they in HA clusters or just single instances?
[11:25:04] <Inge> single instances AFAIK
[11:25:05] <moose> If single instances, the million record folks will likely require maintenance downtime.
[11:25:11] <Inge> sure
[11:25:18] <CoderGuy> alright well this sounds super cool, ty for help moose i'm gonna get back to it enjoy databasing :D
[11:25:41] <moose> CoderGuy: It should use an INT or BIGINT typically for your PK. Always auto-incrementing.
[11:25:56] <moose> There's zero need for GUID, I stand by that.
[11:26:00] <CoderGuy> oh true
[11:26:01] <moose> At least as a PK :)
[11:26:03] <CoderGuy> cuz it's your id right
[11:26:14] <Inge> just an int would likely work fine here
[11:26:25] <moose> Inge: So just do the whole ALTER TABLE whatever MODIFY COLUMN smallcolumn VARCHAR(x+y)
[11:26:27] <CoderGuy> yeah why would an ID have letters unless you doing some weird hex stuff
[11:26:35] <moose> But you may want to drop the connection restrictions into read-only except for admins temporarily.
[11:27:17] <moose> If you have any that are in HA clusters, you can keep one as active one as passive and then fail them over (swap the DBs at the load balancer)
[11:27:25] <moose> Make the change on the passive then do the failover, basically
[11:27:30] <moose> Then complete the change on the active
[11:27:34] <moose> That'll be the zero downtime solution
[11:27:47] <Inge> I'm ignoring all operations sidde for now - alter table alter column fails due to dependencies (fk, pk, index)
[11:27:55] <moose> Both methods are referred to as "roll forward" operations. You can't back out your change unless you restore from a full backup.

[12:52:13] <Babbage> hey
[12:55:08] <MatthiasVance> hi!
[13:08:34] <sysRPL> okay
[13:09:20] <sysRPL> at the end of the 2nd day of me writing a ui tookilt from scratch on top of opengl -> https://streamable.com/5ttp9b
[13:10:17] <bomb> why, though. you didn't like NanoGUI?
[13:10:18] <sysRPL> added: hbox, vbox, slider, tooltips, and optimized things a bit. also added theme color querying, color blending based on opacity, and disabled states for all controls
[13:10:40] <sysRPL> because i thought it would be easier and better if i wrote it myself
[13:11:01] <bomb> okay
[13:11:15] <sysRPL> i also added custom user controls, but haven;t writen one, jsut the base calss for custom user controls
[13:11:26] <bomb> Lazarus-like anchoring please :)
[13:11:57] <sysRPL> all layout is handled for you by way of packing containers
[13:12:35] <sysRPL> you choose from hbox, vbox or window, and set the align to near, center or far, and they arrage all the controls for you
[13:12:50] <bomb> they're not as flexible as "ConstraintLayout"
[13:13:15] <sysRPL> it is supposed to be easy to create layout this way as there is no visual designer
[13:14:26] <sysRPL> and it's also supposed to be a minimal ui toolkit just there so you can set parameters / design physics simulations or create a basic game ui
[13:14:55] <bomb> okay. vbox/hbox is workable
[13:15:13] <sysRPL> i am going to write a "redmond" win95 stlye theme, fix a few things, then write documentation and publish
[13:16:28] <bomb> it's not immediate mode, is it?
[13:17:30] <sysRPL> i am unsure how to answer that
[13:17:56] *** Quits: Lukky (~Lukky@modemcable163.88-161-184.mc.videotron.ca) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:18:00] <sysRPL> because opengl has an immediate mode, and it's not using opengl immediate mode
[13:18:37] <bomb> I'm merely talking about the user-facing API
[13:18:57] <sysRPL> but people unfamiliar with opengl think of immediate mode as rendering each frame every frame. in that respect, yes it's using an immediate mode rendering system
[13:19:38] <bomb> I wasn't asking about its implementation detail
[13:19:46] <bomb> but that's also a nice information
[13:19:47] <sysRPL> it's not meant to be a windowing system. it's meant for providing a basic ui toolkit inside physics simulations, games, or animated graphical demo programs
[13:20:03] <sysRPL> THOUGH
[13:20:50] <sysRPL> it has easy to use render buffer objects, which allow you to draw just once and reuse that, updating things only when a change occurs. it's opt-in though
[13:21:37] <bomb> did you just ask me I'd need to write a retained-mode scene graph on top of your gui toolkit?
[13:21:54] *** Quits: kenanmarasli (~kenanmara@user/kenanmarasli) (Quit: Leaving)
[13:22:28] <sysRPL> just write Buffer := Cnavas.NewBuffer(Width, Height); Buffer.Bind; // now you can draw once to the buffer and reuse it
[13:24:46] <sysRPL> or inside render put ... MainWidget.Render; and it does everything for you
[13:25:47] <sysRPL> MainWidget is a hidden super parent to all widgets in a scene
[13:26:53] <sysRPL> MainWidget.Add<TWindow>.Text := 'Hello World'; // you just added a window with the text 'Hello World' into the scene

[14:40:08] <bomb> and gain a large botnet to do anything XD

[21:36:04] <gufi> took around 15-20 hours
[21:36:20] <Nasp> We also have the orm abstracted and that's probably why it wont be possible

[21:36:37] <Nasp> Even new stuff is made with EF 6 for some reason

[21:37:08] <Nasp> We have 200 something entities and 20-30 DbContexts in that soluti
[21:37:26] <gufi> i created a new project that had all the entities, then went through each service and swapped them out one by one ( grouped a few simple ones )
[21:37:36] <gufi> 20-30... contexts?? what the fuck
[21:37:42] <gufi> though that would make it easier to swap
[21:37:57] <gufi> since you'd only have to swap one context at a time i suppose
[21:38:22] <gufi> our code is also microservicy so they're all intentionally simple
[21:38:40] <gufi> entire application that basically hosts a single service or two
[21:39:01] <gufi> every thing is either a simple api call or rmq consumer
[21:41:16] <Nasp> gufi: Problem is it's so intertwined
[21:41:21] <Nasp> Anyways still not done converting to Core
[21:41:26] <Nasp> Only 200 controllers left :D
[21:41:33] <Nasp> 200 of those as well
