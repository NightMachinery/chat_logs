[12:07:40] <donoban> onla: maybe they block it due some reason?
[12:08:10] <donoban> curl also fails, but maybe it's due tor address
[12:10:17] <onla> donoban: you also get forbidden 403 on those websites with qutebrowser, but not with another browser?
[12:10:51] <donoban> I don't tested other browser

[12:12:26] <donoban> I tested with firefox and chromium without tor and works
[12:12:46] <onla> and qutebrowser gave you also forbidden 403?
[12:13:21] <donoban> yes but I'm running it over tor, I would need to modify some things for testing it with a normal address
[12:13:58] <onla> ok thanks. I wonder if they are blocking some user agents then. Duda is a website generator thing or something, and tasoite-rakennus.fi is a website that uses that duda
[12:14:28] <donoban> let me a few sconds
[12:15:52] <donoban> yes
[12:16:01] <donoban> 403 Forbidden
[12:16:26] <donoban> I'm gonna try curl again, for fast user agent switch
[12:18:43] <donoban> uhM, now I get '301 Moved Permanently' with curl
[12:19:48] <donoban> ok, curl 'https://www.duda.co' works
[12:20:10] <onla> same here. I couldn't replicate 403 forbidden with curl
[12:20:30] <donoban> have you tried faking user agent?
[12:22:37] <onla> no
[12:23:00] <donoban> yeah
[12:23:03] <onla> it's ok. I know how to do it but I do some other task now. Maybe I try later
[12:23:11] <donoban> it fails with
[12:23:13] <donoban> -A 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) QtWebEngine/5.15.3 Chrome/87.0.4280.144 Safari/537.36'
[12:23:50] <onla> ok
[12:24:02] <onla> can you get it to work with some other user agent
[12:24:24] <onla> no need to test but if you want :) just curious
[12:24:25] <donoban> I don't know if there is an option for changing qutebrwoser user agent
[12:24:31] <donoban> I suppose that yes, let me look
[12:24:42] <onla> you can in config.py
[12:25:09] <donoban> can't do it with some command?
[12:25:25] <onla> hmmm, I don't have the config.py here on this work pc that I could give an example. 
[12:25:38] <onla> on my home PC's qutebrowser I have bound a key to switch user agent
[12:25:54] <onla> I don't know, maybe possible
[12:26:29] <donoban> probably it doesn't help very much but I would like to set it to something less fingerprintable
[12:26:56] <donoban> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Qutebrowser#Minimize_fingerprinting
[12:27:07] <donoban> set content.headers.user_agent yah!
[12:35:00] <donoban> onla: it loaded with: :set content.headers.user_agent 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/92.0.4515.131 Safari/537.36'
[12:35:23] <donoban> but failed with other two, it seems a very strict policy
[12:41:16] <onla> ok thanks
[12:44:34] <The-Compiler> donoban: the answer at https://www.reddit.com/r/qutebrowser/comments/tpuqj5/qutebrowser_affected_by_cve20221096/ is spot-on, right now we know nothing

[13:37:19] <ThinkT510> can you test with qutebrowser 2.4?
[13:38:54] <il> I could install the newer version
[13:39:15] <il> Can I preserve the configs, though?
[13:40:36] <ThinkT510> if qutebrowser follows semver then I'd assume there may be breaking changes between 2.0 and 2.4

[13:47:07] <il> that fixed it lol

[13:53:26] <ThinkT510> ah, there you go
[13:53:45] <il> And I keep it updated with install --upgrade
[13:53:58] <The-Compiler> well apparently you did not ;)
[13:54:09] <il> Well, I used the ubuntu repos, so that's my fault
[13:54:12] <il> severely out of date
[13:54:36] <The-Compiler> ThinkT510: semver says there would be no breaking changes between 2.0 and 2.4
[13:55:00] <il> Of course, OpenBSD ports have the newest version
[13:55:01] <ThinkT510> The-Compiler: Is that just new features?
[13:55:04] <il> openbsd is great, I swear

[14:10:32] <The-Compiler> saro: :version has a list, usually ~/.local/share/qutebrowser and ~/.cache/qutebrowser (though that can easily be deleted). You could also just use a different --basedir or --temp-basedir.
[14:10:44] <saro> I see .cache/qutebrowser and `.local/share/qutebrowser`
[14:11:05] <saro> ahh I didn't know :version had a list. Thanks
[14:11:35] <saro> yeah I would like to use my config and everything to try to use the browser daily and eventually fallback on the current version 
[14:11:38] <saro> thanks
[14:12:17] <saro> should I report any issue on https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5395 or open new ticket?
[14:13:14] <The-Compiler> saro: feel free to open a new one, I think that's getting a bit long. It's also a bit hacky and outdated, will start working on a new qt6 branch hopefully this week.
[14:13:36] <The-Compiler> was planning today, but now my phone stopped charging so I have more urgent stuff to take care of again :(

[16:13:22] <The-Compiler> fiete: I suppose you don't really know much about Rust? Would be cool if someone packaged python-adblock for Debian some day ;)
[16:14:41] <ThinkT510> I'm a huge fan of rust
[16:15:02] <The-Compiler> ThinkT510: do you happen to be a Debian developer, or know one? :P
[16:15:26] <ThinkT510> no, debian is much too oudated for my tastes
[16:15:36] <ThinkT510> outdated
[16:15:52] <The-Compiler> Debian != Debian Stable
[16:16:52] <ThinkT510> me != debian developer

[16:49:55] <il> noice
[16:50:15] <il> I have an ubuntu install/system, a void system, and an openbsd ysstem
[16:50:34] <The-Compiler> btw I use Arch (and have since 2010, Ubuntu from 2005-2010)
[16:52:36] <sedrosken> in my constant on/off relationship with Linux -- more on than off in recent years -- I've used Ubuntu from 2007-2012, Arch from 2012-2016, Gentoo sprinkled in here and there, and these days typically Debian. They don't lag behind rolling release quite so bad anymore
[16:53:28] <sedrosken> well. Devuan, because I prefer alternatives to systemd, but it's pretty much Debian in spirit
[16:53:52] <sedrosken> I remember with Wheezy the versions packaged were quite literally years older than what was available elsewhere, meanwhile it seems like these days they release a new stable version at least once a year
[16:55:11] <sedrosken> I've used Slackware and OpenSuSE, and think I've tested Fedora, but don't have any preference for them tbh
[16:55:26] <il> I used some ubuntu derivative distros in the beginning, I liked xfce
[16:55:27] *** Joins: svs3 (svs3@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/svs3)
[16:55:35] <il> then I used some arch with tiling wms, of course, did the i3 thing for some years
[16:55:46] <il> and then I needed something that'd just work, so I used kubuntu
[16:55:53] <il> that's actually this system, only I removed a lot of it
[16:55:54] <sedrosken> I toyed with Void, but at the time I tried it I was turned off by how tiny the repos were and how they basically meant for you to be your own maintainer for packages that were standard everywhere else
[16:56:07] <sedrosken> granted that was like
[16:56:09] <sedrosken> 2017 I think
[16:56:17] <il> I
[16:56:21] <sedrosken> I ought to give them another shot sometime
[16:56:22] <il> might try kiss linux
[16:56:26] <il> if I"m feeling adventurous one day
[16:56:30] <il> But there's too much stuff to do before then
[16:56:44] <sedrosken> My main system runs i3wm right now, with a 1440p display it just makes sense to me to make the most of it with a tiling wm
[16:56:48] <il> I mean, so far, I like openbsd on an old thinkpad a lot, I might get another old thinkpad for that lol
[16:57:08] <il> I realized I don't care about tiling that much, as long as I can do everything with a keyboard
[16:57:10] <il> so I use cwm
[16:57:23] <il> Have been for 2-3 years now, don't remember when I started
[16:57:25] <sedrosken> I want to like BSD, I ran NetBSD on an old K6 system I have kicking around and while I was impressed that it even just RAN and gave me a working X server, it was clearly not meant for it
[16:57:41] <sedrosken> 224MB used of the 256MB RAM it had at a TWM session with nothing else running
[16:57:48] <il> I know compatibility can be a bitch for bsds, but
[16:57:53] <il> openbsd works ootb on old thinkpads
[16:57:56] <il> like, everything works lol
[16:58:12] <sedrosken> I mean, it'd be strange if it didn't considering their popularity with the FOSS crowd
[16:58:32] <sedrosken> overall, BSD just isn't really for me I think
[16:58:47] <il> why
[16:59:04] <sedrosken> I want to like it but just enough is different that I end up stumbling, embarrassing myself, and giving up out of frustration and sticking to what I know
[16:59:24] <sedrosken> that and I like to run more recent hardware than a Core2 or Sandy Bridge thinkpad
[16:59:50] <il> I think you can do the latter with freebsd

[16:59:59] <il> although I don't know how good documentation/community is for freebsd
[17:00:02] <il> for openbsd it's excellent
[17:00:10] <sedrosken> I hear it's Fine(tm)
[17:00:12] <il> a lot of things just make sense
[17:00:42] <sedrosken> I might kick it around in a VM sometime, get a better feel for it, but I don't think I'm ready to run it on a machine I use everyday
[17:02:52] <sedrosken> I also like to run certain games on my main, and even with WINE and the supposed Linux compatibility layer being able to run Steam just enough doesn't work that I'm like "I'll just leave it like it is thanks"
