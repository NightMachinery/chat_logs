[00:57:28] <FromGitter> <ro6> When I go to a new filetype for the first time and LSP presents me with a choice like the image below, what am I really deciding on?
[01:01:31] <FromGitter> <kjartan_oli:matrix.org> I believe that is a prompt for which language server to install.
[01:01:35] <FromGitter> <ro6> ha, nevermind I'm being stupid. That's not an option, it's the title bar :facepalm
[01:35:14] <FromGitter> <ro6> After switching to hybrid editing mode, every time I reload `.spacemacs`, I'm seeing this: ‚èé `Error (use-package): hybrid-mode/:config: Variable binding depth exceeds max-specpdl-size` ‚èé Everything still seems to be working fine though.
[05:31:22] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> @ro6 Thanks for reporting. If you're willing to help, please restart Emacs, toggle on debug with `M-x toggle-debug-on-error` and enter hybrid mode. And post the backtrace to github.

[19:06:45] <FromGitter> <DJManas> Hello guys, I am sorry, but maybee it would be better to write here, than to write garbage into the issues list. Few days ago I started thread about feature request for the thing that I can't set debugpy as python debugger (variable dap-python-debugger). I did further research and found out, that my configuration is not correct, because when I launch M-: eval expression and write dap-python-debugger I can see 
[19:06:45] <FromGitter> ... ptvsd. But when I use M-x, set-variable and use dap-python-debugger and set it to debugpy, it works like a charm. So I guess I must have wrong configuration in .spacemacs file, but I am lost here. Where should I put this variable?
[19:08:36] <FromGitter> <DJManas> At the moment I got it inside block dotspacemacs/user-config, where I have setq-default and after '( I got (dap-mode :variables dap-python-debugger 'debugpy)), what is wrong with this?
[20:26:52] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> post your .spacemacs
[20:32:46] <FromGitter> <DJManas> https://pastebin.com/smsPw2MG
[20:34:10] <FromGitter> <DJManas> I had tried dap, dap-mode and having the same section in user-config or user-init. Everytime after change I restarted emacs SPC q-R
[20:43:59] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> oh... you config is vastly wrong
[20:44:12] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> look at line 572
[20:44:30] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> you should not set dotspacemacs-configuration-layers in user-config
[20:44:48] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> that has no effect
[22:40:51] <FromGitter> <DJManas> Ok, I went out from this documentation, from python layer. I mean, is there some documentation I can start out of, how to set it properly?
[22:40:52] <FromGitter> <DJManas> https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+lang/python/README.html#fill-column
[23:02:06] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> it doesn't mean you should add it to user-config
[23:02:44] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> and don't read the documentation. read source code.
[23:05:24] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> this one in particular is misleading
[23:05:46] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> layer configuration should always be done in dotspacemacs/layers
[23:14:41] <FromGitter> <DJManas> Oh I see. Thanks
