[13:51:45] <brm_> sorry if kinda oot if i ran php -m | grep redis and it showed i can assume it the php redis working isnt (whether i use php-redis / pecl ) ? or i completely ignore something else in order to verify redis.so for php ? sorry
[13:52:49] <Naktibalda> yes, if you see redis in php -m, then it means that redis module is enabled for php-cli

[13:53:44] <Naktibalda> mod_php and php-fpm usually have their own separate configuration files, so php -m doesn't guarantee that redis extension is enabled for your webserver

[16:57:01] <nokiomanz> Good morning or any other part of the day you are in! Using php-fpm, if I set the pm.max_children to 200, I can accept up to 200 concurrent connection at 1 php-fpm process per connection. If I send more, php-fpm seems to hang and stop responding to all. Not sure on the mechanic here but is there a way to work around that? If I send more as part of a benchmark I need to end up restarting the pfp-fpm process. Hope I
[16:57:01] <nokiomanz> make sense on my question
[17:00:31] <Blondie101010> are you sure it stops responding, and that it isn't simply waiting for the scripts to end?

[17:06:15] <nokiomanz> Blondie101010, I am sure? No, I am in the process of learning as much as I can on how php-fpm works. Before, and for the past many years, I have been using apache with mod_php. Give me a seconds and I will try to add a bit more info on the bahavior I get/see
[17:08:47] <nokiomanz> if the config is set to 200 and I sent concurrent connection. I get to see php-fpm process spawn up to 200 in number. Which makes sense. If I sent 250 concurrent connection I get a pool seems busy from the log saying that there are 0 idle. And then It stops there. Looking at the apache log nothing moves. as if stuck there. I though that it would server the 200 first connection that came and then but in wait the add
[17:08:47] <nokiomanz> ed 50 or something or just drop those 50
[17:10:30] <AllenJB> I don't have real experience with a system ever hitting it, but as I understand it reading the docs there's a backlog, which defaults to unlimited size (see the listen.backlog fpm pool setting) (or whatever the OS allows) which connections enter if they can't be immediately handled.
[17:10:31] <AllenJB> The web server would then timeout the connection to fpm if it's not handled within a time specified by the webserver connection.
[17:14:02] <nokiomanz> Yeah, I know my "real" concurrent connection that I will need. But I like to bench and test a server to see where he can go. And how it will behave if it goes too high. I will look unto the listen.backlog.

[17:21:46] <nokiomanz> hoooo I like this a lot ! I will go play with that immediatly! All in all I think I start to understand how it all work together and what needs to be done to get an apache/php-fpm to scale more. At first I had to switch from a socket to a tcp port to talk to php-fpm because of performance issue. And now I am back on a socket. Improvement on my side I say ! Thanks for sharing that info.
[17:23:35] <nokiomanz> If I can abuse, ubuntu seems to have a default ulimit for open file at 1024. Do you think that can be a problem when using a socket type configuration?
[17:28:31] <Blondie101010> like any other parameter, it is meant to be adjusted based on your needs, but keeping a low default is a sane choice

[19:37:19] <Koopz> though this is only true as long as your crontab's line actually looks like "/usr/bin/php /path/to/php-file.php do:stuff" and not "/usr/bin/curl http://intranet/cronjob.php"  ;D
[19:37:52] <haroldjfks> Koopz: ok
[19:38:56] <AllenJB> Tip of the day: Don't do the latter if you can help it. Web requests are subject to timeouts that can stop your script unexpectedly which cli requests are not. On a busy site they also tie-up web server / php-fpm connections.
[19:46:26] <Koopz> ah how fondly i remember having to write exceptions in the application to let calls to specific actions through without redirecting to the login page as well as setting the timeout to 10 minutes just for cronjobs to work
[19:47:34] <Koopz> and don't forget about the memory limit xD
[19:49:14] <Koopz> until i finally found out i could just do the proper cli approach with fancy progress bars and whatnot
[19:50:00] <Koopz> which then made me stumble upon the problem of needing to give users the ability to trigger those processes from the webinterface
[19:51:11] <AllenJB> Also: Random things on the internet will obtain and poke URLs. I worked one place that had customer alerts set up on a web-run cronjob. Developers would enter the URL in their browser with a special query parameter to test it (send results to specific IP).
[19:51:12] <AllenJB> Then one day our ISP started requesting the URLs with no query parameters attached, which would run the cron in live mode and send emails to lots of customers.
