[03:40:14] <kee> Whoops, you're right. I meant INT_MAX.
[03:40:43] <InPhase> quartz: if (current < smallest) { current = smallest; } ...  Read that again slowly.
[03:41:29] <kee> That is probably a more significant bug. :-)
[03:41:59] <InPhase> quartz: Professional programming tip:  Don't smack the forehead too hard.  This can cause unpleasant skin damage.
[03:42:09] <quartz> InPhase: Ahhh thanks.
[03:42:22] <quartz> InPhase: I don't catch the meaning of that...
[03:42:28] <kee> Btw if this is C, you don't need to write `int current = 0;` at the beginning. You can put `int current = Math.abs…` inside the for loop.

[03:43:31] <InPhase> quartz: A joke.  It is a standard human trait to apply rapid motion of the hand toward the forehead upon spending too much time looking for what is in retrospect an obvious bug.  While it can be healthy to emulate human traits in order to blend in with the humans, this one can cause pain.
[03:43:57] *** Quits: zaher (~zaher@37.48.177.207) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[03:44:24] <quartz> InPhase: Fair enough. The thing does not work for edge cases like  x = 3 y = 4 int[][] points = [[3,4]]
[03:44:32] <quartz> So basically it should return 0, but mine returns -1
[03:44:35] <kee> InPhase: That's the bug I pointed out!
[03:44:39] <InPhase> quartz: Correct, that's because of what kee is telling you
[03:45:20] <quartz> Oh
[03:47:11] <quartz> No offense, but isn't it bad programming practice to use stuff like INT_MAX
[03:47:17] <quartz> Just seems weird to do that.
[03:47:22] <quartz> But what do I know honestly
[03:47:27] <kee> Why would it be bad programming practice?
[03:47:30] <sonny> it's the boundary condition
[03:47:39] <InPhase> quartz: It's a hacky shortcut which fails when one of your input values has that distance.
[03:47:52] <InPhase> quartz: You can always replace that with an additional boolean variable.
[03:48:07] <kee> But the code fails when x = -20 and points[i][0] = INT_MAX + 5
[03:48:14] <kee> You should really use a long, not an int.
[03:48:50] <InPhase> quartz: The problem you have is that you initialized smallest to the first element, but did not initialize index to the same element, and the first element will never be less than the first element.
[03:48:51] <kee> But I'm pretty sure leetcode won't give you a test case like that.
[03:49:13] <kee> InPhase: But the 0th possibility might not be valid
[03:49:38] <quartz> InPhase: Right.
[03:50:25] <InPhase> kee: Correct, so initializing to that is invalid.
[03:50:26] <quartz> InPhase: But how would the boolean work if I need to compare current with the smallest seen
[03:50:38] <InPhase> quartz: Which consequently means that initializing smallest to that first value is equally invalid.
[03:50:46] <quartz> yeah
[03:51:11] <InPhase> quartz: Consider, your first element might be x=2, y=2, point (3,3) distance 2, and the closest valid might be distance 5.

[07:19:41] <xheimlic1> it's basically progress is good good good.
[07:19:57] <duuude> what are the arguments for non-universal units?
[07:20:06] <xheimlic1> there's nothing intrinsically better about metric.
[07:20:12] <amigojapan> actually "meter" just means "mesuring tape"
[07:20:13] <xheimlic1> duuude: they're already in use. 
[07:20:36] <xheimlic1> that's a mic drop for me. You have to argue for change, not the way around.
[07:20:41] <duuude> I just can't bother to remember what was ounce or carat for the 10 times in year I may hear them
[07:20:55] <duuude> or how much is a "barrel" of oil
[07:20:59] <xheimlic1> duuude: that's because you're not in the jewelry business.
[07:21:04] <amigojapan> xheimlic1:whats better is that every county uses metric
[07:21:13] <xheimlic1> I used to be in energy modeling.
[07:21:41] <xheimlic1> When I was living in that world, I knew what a barrel of oil was.
[07:21:43] <duuude> xheimlic1: well, would metric hurt them? no. would it be better for me to understand? yes.
[07:21:49] <xheimlic1> btw carats are different things for diamonds and gold.
[07:21:59] <xheimlic1> duuude: it would. they'd have to change eeeeeeeeverything.
[07:22:01] <duuude> even worse

[07:22:15] <xheimlic1> I mean, didn't a space vehicle explode because of how complex metrication is?
[07:22:31] <duuude> which one?
[07:22:34] <xheimlic1> you need carats if you work in jewelry. then you know what there are.
[07:23:23] <xheimlic1> for a while I was in the energy business and could convert barrels of oil to liters of gasoline (assuming some standard conversion rates)
[07:24:00] <flaqoniun> the mars one, i don't know if it exploded though, they blamed unit conversion software bug
[07:24:34] <xheimlic1> when you're trying to avoid accidentally quadratic and other small algorithm problems, you know O(n) from O(log n) or even O(nlog n) in your bones. If you've learned the basics and worked in algorithms for many months.
[07:24:35] <duuude> It would be nicer if they were in metric, and if they aren't, that is the result of historical failing and legacy
[07:24:41] <duuude> like timezones
[07:24:53] <duuude> timezones are expensive nonsense

[07:26:17] <xheimlic1> this is sometimes called Chesterton's fence.
[07:26:54] <xheimlic1> timezones are a weird situation because many people don't live in proper time zones anymore.
[07:27:07] <xheimlic1> timezone lines were enlarged to fit political units.
[07:27:26] <xheimlic1> but where I live we have three time zones and even being in the middle of two timezone lines is already annoying.

[08:48:27] <vdamewood> strlen makes no distinction between bytes and chars either. It just returns the number of characters from the one pointed to, the the one before the first encountered '\0' character.
[08:48:36] <amigojapan> I don't think strlen counts the null string 
[08:48:47] <vdamewood> amigojapan: s/string/character/
[08:49:05] <amigojapan> Right sorry
[08:49:19] <vdamewood> It's not something to apologize for.
[08:49:35] <amigojapan> Sorry
[08:49:39] <KillerWasp> Also, the number of bytes reserved is less important than the number of characters used, which with strlen()+1 helps you allocate memory based on the number of characters used.
[08:49:45] <vdamewood> Neither is that. And don't apologize for that either.

[11:00:31] <CoderGuy> Considering Javascript, string.split returns an array, even if there was nothing to split. But if what you want is a string if split doesn't actually split, what's the best solution?
[11:01:21] <CoderGuy> Should you A) check via string.indexOf() for the split char before splitting? Or B) check the length of the array from the split result & set the array to a string given the length is 1?
[11:03:50] <GeDaMo> You can pass an option 'limit' parameter to split
[11:03:58] <GeDaMo> It limits the number of values returned
[11:04:21] <GeDaMo> I'm just thinking out loud :P
[11:07:54] <GeDaMo> What are you going to do with the result after you split?
[11:08:45] <GeDaMo> It seems strange that you want two possible types for the result

[19:05:04] <GeDaMo> I've wondered before about better terms than left and right shift, maybe upshift and downshift
[19:05:20] <deniska> if we're talking "physical" stuff, you access data in modern RAM in much wider chunks than a single byte anyway
[19:05:33] <deniska> And many architectures prohibit unaligned access
[19:06:18] <deniska> GeDaMo: "chomp" for shift right, "bump" for left shift
[19:06:49] <pyzozord> deniska: wait what, I think in assembly you can address any byte you want
[19:07:00] <GeDaMo> You can
[19:07:03] <deniska> pyzozord: depends on the architecture
[19:07:11] <deniska> pyzozord: x86 is fairly lax in that regard
[19:07:15] <pyzozord> I think only about x86
[19:07:37] <GeDaMo> ARM, MIPS and RISC-V also allow accessing single bytes from memory
[19:07:44] <deniska> on many other architectures, the address you load often have to be multiples of 2 or 4 or 8
[19:08:11] <deniska> on ARM I think program counter is 2x bytes aligned?
[19:08:14] <pyzozord> I never heard of it, but I imagine it could be done
[19:08:26] <deniska> or was it m68k? >_>

[19:08:43] <deniska> haha, a bit :D

[19:09:07] <Bou> programmers don't byte, they nibble a bit
[19:09:19] <davve> in any case, you only need to check for endianness when reading/writing from memory

[19:54:51] <Intelo> InPhase ignore 'popular'
[19:55:05] <InPhase> bnchs__: Because when you are writing programs that require security guarantees, you need a language that enforces constraints and guarantees throughout the program.  That way you can construct low level and mid-level components with security and robustness guarantees of behavior, and then build these up with layers of well-designed abstraction to get higher level application behavior that follows 
[19:55:09] <Intelo> InPhase will your answer change if you ignore popularity?
[19:55:11] <InPhase> guarantees about what will happen.  It is basically like engineering yourself somewhat of a security proof about what the program will do.  With C this is nearly impossible.
[19:55:35] <bnchs__> why is it nearly impossible?
[19:55:46] <bnchs__> and why should i need a language to babysit me
[19:56:01] <InPhase> bnchs__: I was a huge C fan for a full decade, back in the era that it was the only way to get peak performance code, so I don't dismiss it lightly.  But it definitely has huge weaknesses that make it very inappropriate for writing modern code with security requirements.

[19:57:39] <Intelo> What language can empower most to a one man show/ one man army?
[19:57:56] <InPhase> bnchs__: A "guarantee" means a piece of code where all code that uses it through the provided interface will get only specified correct behavior.
[19:58:07] <bnchs__> InPhase, you will get that
[19:58:14] <bnchs__> unless you A) fuck up the string pointer

[20:01:47] <InPhase> bnchs__: It's not that you "can't" write secure programs in C.  It's that C does not provide scalable guarantees, so the robustness and security issues spread broadly over massive parts of the program, meaning that it requires a massive time investment and a constant attention to low level details in high level logic to make sure everything actually works correctly.  This failure of C results in 
[20:01:53] <InPhase> MOST of the security bugs in C programs.  So it is literally the case that MOST of the security bugs in C code simply do not happen in modern designs of C++ programs.  (Or Rust.)

[20:09:47] <InPhase> bnchs__: A robust and secure program is such that if you try to position an image at coordinate (1,1), (-20,-30), or (92341234, "bathroom"), it will not crash.  Which is best obtained when the components you use to do the positioning have no possibility of crashing.  Which is best obtainable when you have clean interfaces all the way down the chain such that from the lowest level components on up, 
[20:09:53] <InPhase> the behaviors of all possible inputs are well-defined, and there are no leaky abstraction possibilities for crashing or undefined behavior from bad input values.

Every single one of them is an undefined behavior risk, where the value can be null, the pointer can be out of lifetime, and ownership of the data resource is not specified in the type being passed along.

It's learnable, and you can do it.  When you scale up to larger programs with more interactions, eventually things get missed when the prerequisite and postrequisite requirements are far away from the implementation details of the leaky abstractions.

[22:20:20] <GeDaMo> Are traits not similar to interfaces?
[22:20:43] <pyzozord> no, I think they are very different things
[22:21:11] <GeDaMo> "For inter-object communication, traits are somewhere between an object-oriented protocol (interface) and a mixin. An interface may define one or more behaviors via method signatures, while a trait defines behaviors via full method definitions: i.e., it includes the body of the methods. In contrast, mixins include full method definitions and may also carry state through member variable, while traits usually don't." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_(com
[22:21:18] <pyzozord> traits are like partial, unfinished classes that get mixed in with normal classes, afaik
[22:21:54] <pulse> sounds like composition
[22:22:34] <pyzozord> it's not really composition, you can't refer to it through variables, it just becomes a part of your class, I think it's closer to inheritance

[23:11:06] <epony> your cpu does not go rewrite your program

[23:11:20] <kee> The CPU reorders the instructions. That's not a full rewrite.

[23:38:14] <kee> True. And the reason freeing all the memory took so long is because of swap thrashing.
[23:38:17] <epony> and kernels have dynamic / automatic memory management anyway
[23:38:41] <epony> no, because it passes through storage sub-system
[23:38:58] <kee> Because the deallocation was happening in a different order to the allocation.
[23:39:00] <epony> that's not how you prove automatic memory management is faster or more efficient
[23:40:03] *** Quits: CyberTailor (~cyber@gateway/tor-sasl/cybertailor) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:40:46] <kee> I'm not saying…
[23:40:48] <epony> larger memory allocation is always a slower operation because you wait more from the memory management unit
[23:40:52] <kee> Sometimes GC is appropriate.
[23:40:58] <kee> That's all I'm saying.
[23:42:01] *** Joins: CyberTailor (~cyber@gateway/tor-sasl/cybertailor)
[23:42:08] <pyzozord> i mean in some sense garbage collection is just not freeing everything right away

[23:42:34] <pyzozord> in that sense I have no problem with garbage collection

[23:42:59] <epony> except that.. it never fits in cache

[23:43:25] <GeDaMo> Although it does involve a fair amount of copying
[23:43:31] <pyzozord> although to be honest for my day job, having gc in go is a godsent
[23:43:51] <epony> and if you're using a virtual machine, it already has GC so having one in your application is double memory allocation GC churn
[23:44:28] <epony> and you have one in the kernel for data structures and (virtual) memory management (automatic) so it becomes tripple GC churn
