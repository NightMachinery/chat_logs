[00:14:00] <monochrom> My collection of the GHC-API is that I had to call one function to create a record (it contains IORefs), then I had to pass this record to all other functions.
[00:14:13] <monochrom> So I think ghci does the same, but I haven't checked.
[00:14:37] <monochrom> So it goes back to the non-global solution.
[00:15:05] <geekosaur> ghc-api does have its globals though; consider unsafeDynFlags
[00:15:17] <geekosaur> granting that they're in the process of cleaning that up recently
[00:15:21] <monochrom> That said, gtk2hs solves multi-threading with a secret global IORef for a queue.
[00:16:36] <monochrom> It's marvelous. You know how gtk+ is one of those C libraries that "you must choose one thread, and only that thread is allowed to call gtk+ functions".  Hell, you're working with such a C library right now.
[00:17:02] <monochrom> So how does gtk2hs allow you to call gtk2hs functions in any thread you like, every time a different thread?
[00:18:08] <monochrom> So you are supposed to use postGUISync or postGUISync, depending on whether you want to wait or not.

[00:18:54] <monochrom> Both of them enter the thunk that stands for your function call into the global queue.

[00:19:22] <monochrom> gtk2hs's main loop periodically dequeues and makes the actual call.
[00:19:39] <monochrom> So all actual calls are made in the same thread as the main loop.
[00:19:59] <monochrom> But it still requires a global queue. Which is basically your scenerio.
[00:20:29] <monochrom> Now, how do you make a queue in Haskell?
[00:20:58] <monochrom> Most people don't mind an immutable queue, and putting it in an IORef if mutability is desired.
[00:21:43] <monochrom> Furthermore, for an immutable queue, most people don't mind settling for amortized O(1) time, it's simpler.
[00:22:10] <monochrom> Then it's a tuple of two lists, let's call them "front" and "back".
[00:22:32] <monochrom> To enter something into the queue, back_new = x : back
[00:22:58] <monochrom> To dequeue: If front is non-empty, take the head.
[00:23:24] <monochrom> If front is empty, front_new = reverse back, back_new = [].  Now try again.
[00:23:38] <texasmynsted> I am curious if anybody is doing anything with Haskell and ORC files. I saw this https://www.huwcampbell.com/posts/2020-09-18-announcing-orc-haskell.html

[01:49:18] <monochrom> quoting allows writing a string literal to be parsed to an ADT, and the ADT can have nothing to do with the host language.

[02:31:10] <monochrom> Well, if the user supplies a type sig, the compiler is obliged to not generalize that behind your back.
[02:31:13] <int-e> But in fact it does!
[02:31:31] <int-e> (Though ghc will be smart about it if it knows that the type is the same)
[02:31:39] <monochrom> But if you define "x = (0,1)" without type sig and without MMR, you do get x :: (Num a, Num b) => (a, b).

[04:54:14] <jackdk> in fact, stack does a great job of encouraging bitrot, as its templates create libraries with no bounds on deps, which then get uploaded to hackage and break things for everyone else
[04:54:20] <mechano> you wade in quite rudely davean
[04:54:29] <monochrom> But it involves keeping even the old hardware.
[04:54:47] <monochrom> And he didn't even have Haskell in mind.  More likely C.
[04:54:52] <EvanR> I'd appreciate a stackage for old hardware
[04:55:02] <mechano> jackdk: ah, i wasnt aware of this issue to do with bounds
[04:55:04] <jackdk> Particular recent example: base >= 4.x && <5 admits unreleased versions which are allowed to contain breaking changes, which is exactly what happened when GHC9 appeared on the scene
[04:55:08] <jackdk> also aeson-2.0
[04:55:20] <johnjaye> ephemient: what is the difference between v1 and v2 in cabal? i saw a makefile that was talking about v1 commands
[04:55:22] <EvanR> operator, get me an old BeBox, for R5
[04:55:33] <glassy> i thought v2 had atomic updates and stuff like that?
[04:55:38] <glassy> i'm probably wrong
[04:55:42] <Guest24> could i put an if statement within an if statement
[04:55:43] <davean> glassy: that -j is the package parallization, not the GHC
[04:55:54] <glassy> what do you mean by package parallization?
[04:56:03] <monochrom> His way translated to Haskell, you wouldn't even refer to stackage online.  You would download the tarballs, and stick to them.  You don't even know that stackage won't change the tarballs.
[04:56:12] <jackdk> so I consider the patterns encouraged by stack to be extremely rude, in that they use the bounds information to construct their snapshots, and then encourage the uploading of packages which make that break that information source.
[04:56:25] <davean> glassy: compiling seperate packages in parallel, not inside a package
[04:56:39] <davean> glassy: and most of cabal stuff is atomic - what do you mean by atomic updates?
[04:56:43] <ephemient> my approximate flowchart is: stack is fine if you just want some libraries as an end-product and don't particularly care which versions. cabal is required if you want to stay up to date or ship something to be used by other users
[04:57:01] <glassy> i just thought you could rollback stuff with cabal v2, i'm not well informed
[04:57:12] <davean> glassy: 
[04:57:24] <davean> The concept of "rollback" isn't meaningful for v2
[04:57:54] <jackdk> I can respect that it helps people making applications at the leaf of the dependency graph, but it also holds the ecosystem back. There's little enthusiasm for using things like backpack and multiple internal libraries because they don't work with stack, and stack has not enough dev resources
[04:57:57] <mechano> jackdk: hmm, so it doesnt ensure against breaking changes from new ghc versions. thats a shame, since that was the reason i was using it. i guess if it doesnt even do that, then my reason for using it, and advocating for it, and the haskell toolchain - based on a rationality of the snapshots ... wait, how does what you say change anything, the
[04:57:57] <mechano> snapshots should always use the correct ghc
[04:58:04] <glassy> lol idk
[04:58:28] <glassy> davean: how do i make builds inside a package parallel as well as compiling seperate packages in parallel?
[04:58:42] <glassy> been wondering for about a year embarassingly
[04:58:53] <glassy> maybe i got it working but my disk is the bottleneck
[04:58:58] <Guest24> https://paste.tomsmeding.com/6yumtqfg
[04:59:24] <Guest24> this is what I've changed
[05:00:04] <dibblego> it's Friday somewhere, go to the pub
[05:00:05] <jackdk> mechano: maybe the snapshots continue to work. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that the patterns encouraged by stack encourage people to submit misbehaving libraries to hackage, which makes the ecosystem worse for everyone else. I don't support bootstrapping off someone else's commons, and then making it worse
[05:00:08] <davean> glassy: Also, is your setup a custom setup?
[05:00:10] <mechano> ephemient: as far as i could tell it was the only way to ensure that a personal project that builds could certainly be built again at another time
[05:00:31] <glassy> davean no, it is just cabal now after i moved from stack
[05:00:37] <glassy> i don't have any dot files changing compilation
[05:00:54] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[05:01:19] <jackdk> besides, who knows if the ghc you download will run against the system libs on your build machine in the future? Nix will get you closer, but this question will ultimately bottom out against the fact that GHC doesn't have a working bootstrap path any more
[05:01:28] <monochrom> dibblego: But the pubs are closed in my city :(
[05:01:33] <davean> glassy: see https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/5176
[05:01:38] <dibblego> can't be, that's illegal
[05:01:58] <davean> glassy: if you have parallism between package builds - the strongest parallelism - then you have a problem of getting the correct overall parallelism when there is parallelism inside a build
[05:02:04] <ephemient> mechano: cabal can certainly pin versions, including ghc. the onus is on you to have a working GHC version, but I think that's reasonable: ghcup makes it easy
[05:02:23] <glassy> i've tried using ghc-options -j 24 too
[05:02:43] <glassy> it is hard to know how to split threads between building packages and those packages themselves
[05:02:45] <ephemient> I still use stack for personal projects, but I'm sort of expecting to have to switch off of it as it's in community maintenance mode now

[05:38:10] <Axman6> there is a lot wrong with the line "isBanana if (f,s,h) == Banana"
[05:38:19] <Axman6> firstly, there's no = so it is not a definition'
[05:39:25] <Axman6> seccondly, (f,s,h) has type (Flavour, Scoops, HasSprinkles) but Banana has type Flavour, so you can't test if they are equal, only things of the same type can be equsl

[06:06:23] <zwro[m]> So here are the exact rules used by MonoLocalBinds. With MonoLocalBinds, a binding group will be generalised if and only if
[06:06:23] <zwro[m]> Each of its free variables (excluding the variables bound by the group itself) is closed (see next bullet), or
[06:06:23] <zwro[m]> Any of its binders has a partial type signature (see Partial Type Signatures). Adding a partial type signature f :: _, (or, more generally, f :: _ => _) provides a per-binding way to ask GHC to perform let-generalisation, even though MonoLocalBinds is on.
[06:07:48] <zzz> zwro[m]: that doesn't explain my example. I don't think MonoLocalBinds is relevant even

[09:01:45] <Axman6> It turns out that a lot of what you really need for real applications is ReaderT, which contains any config you need, connection objects, logging functions etc. but it can be nice to be able to talk about those separately

[09:07:16] <ski> (and yea, i like the spontaneity, but also the occasional conversation over larger spans of time. and the non-proprietaryness, openness to different clients, lack of built-in / blessed logging, lack of (in-line) images and other such nonsense, and (mostly) lack of emoji. (i believe that many of these contribute to particularities of IRC culture in a way that might not be completely evident). obviously we 
[09:07:17] <Axman6> people get confused by IRC by joining and not seeing anyone talk for five minutes - if you have a question, you just ask it, and if people are around they'll answer

[09:20:46] <Axman6> there's a couple of feature I miss but they're not a big deal... the only one that comes to mind is better support for split screens (I don't understand how glirc's work) - I used to always have a 20 line high split with just mentions in it
[09:20:54] <ski> (re absence of logging, it seems to me this contributes to (many, though not all) people (regulars) staying connected for longer period of times, and thus contributes to the common "lurk until someone says something interesting" pattern. also picking up threads and conversations from a while ago)
[09:21:18] <glguy> Axman6: glirc's split screen works like how I used xmonad
[09:21:23] <Axman6> ski: I like the lack of time pressure that brings
[09:21:26] <ksqsf> monochrom: nice gradient!
[09:21:28] <ski> yes
[09:21:36] <glguy> a column for a main window, and a column for the stuff I'm watching
[09:21:59] <glguy> (or optionally all in one column)
[09:22:27] <glguy> zzz: It's best for me, but not for everyone. You'll likely find you prefer irssi :)
[09:22:28] <Axman6> would love to know how to do that - I think I tried but couldn't figure out how to a) have a fixed size window with mentions/highlights, b) how to configure that in the config
[09:23:24] <ski> zzz : well, using Irssi, i've still only made very few customizations (i guess i've very lazy/tolerant/reluctant to cross the threshold to adding much such stuff)
[09:23:50] <Axman6> I definitely found glirc easier to configure than irssi
[09:24:34] <Axman6> Also, by default there's a highlight set up for the word glirc, so I know that every time I say glirc it highlights all the glirc users
[09:24:43] <zzz> oak-: it's a long list, but between dropped messages, not rare over a minute latency (up to 2 hours, i've experienced) and weird stuff like messages not being sent when not all matrix users in one channel can see eachother or something like that

[14:15:18] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[14:15:48] <mechano> here the low dimensional space is that rhythms are something to do with how the brain expects a repeated sound, because of how it processes vocal tones (im guessing) - and that this gives the language, which people have somehow naturally determined...
[14:16:02] <[exa]> mechano: lexers and parsers are usually formalized as programs that compute matches to regular and context-free languages
[14:16:10] *** Joins: Morrow (~Morrow@bzq-110-168-31-106.red.bezeqint.net)

[14:19:30] <mechano> i guess the main differernce is that a language isnt a black box parametric model, and that all of the design variables are comprehensible
[14:20:01] <[exa]> also NNs are tremendously inefficient compared to parsers that you can automatically define from a formal language spec (regex/automaton, CF grammar, ...)

[14:22:07] <[exa]> like, this is getting to automata & grammar theory which is kinda offtopic anyway :D
[14:22:16] <[exa]> no big worries I guess tho
[14:22:49] <[exa]> the point is that spec is not giving a test case, it is a complete, always decidable specification of what is in a language and what isn't
[14:23:08] <mechano> so how does haskell fit in to all this? i mean, i was just using a simple example to try to understand how an actual language can be described
[14:23:36] *** Quits: mc47 (~mc47@xmonad/TheMC47) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:23:54] <[exa]> haskell has a quite complicated context-free grammar, you might find the "specifications" in GHC source, likely as alex/happy parser source code

[14:25:46] <mechano> im struggling to get the difference between a basis transformation, eg a matrix in linear algebra, and the compilation and program writing process as a kind of similar bijection. is the specification fulfilling the same role as the matrix parameters?
[14:26:34] <[exa]> the difference is that compiling program by basis transoformation is theoretically possible but a total madness to do correctly
[14:26:37] <mechano> [exa] wait, why does haskell use happy & alex? what are those, how do they work here?
[14:27:13] <ephemient> alex : happy :: lex : yacc
[14:27:54] <mechano> ephemient: im not sure what that means
[14:27:56] <[exa]> mechano: are you aware of the finite-state machine theory, pushdown automata, etc?
[14:28:09] <mechano> im guessing that the parser has some state
[14:28:24] <mechano> during a fold that consumes the program string
[14:28:45] <ephemient> alex is to happy as lex is to yacc. lex and yacc are well-known lexers and parser generators in old-school compilers, alex and happy fulfill similar roles in Haskell

[14:34:03] <[exa]> normal parser state machines have "stacks" (ie. infinite memory) which is impossible to do easily, but you can convert limited-depth stack machine to DFAs and go the same way
[14:34:23] <[exa]> ending up with matrices like 10000000x10000000 for parsing haskell
[14:34:41] <ephemient> a parser generator. you give it a grammar and it spits out Haskell code

[14:35:25] <[exa]> (I'm assuming there are no shenanigans (there are) and no lookahead)

[14:36:29] <mechano> ephemient: sounds more like a lexer that outputs parser, which seems confusing
[14:36:31] <[exa]> you won't fit it on earth IMO
[14:36:56] <mechano> so how does the compiler end up being so elegant?
[14:37:06] <mechano> is that because its a good language?
[14:37:22] <[exa]> it avoids expressing problems in inefficient ways
[14:37:27] <mechano> or because its written in a good language? im still slightly confused about the stages ere
[14:37:32] *** Quits: Codaraxis_ (~Codaraxis@user/codaraxis) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[14:38:32] <mechano> something to do with them being consumed in an ordered way?
[14:38:54] <[exa]> same with neural nets, you can express the learning task as precise boolean logic problem, but no one does that because the complexity of doing it that way would be completely hopeless
[14:39:02] <mechano> you only get left to right determinism then... but i cant see that being responsible for the most part of the savings
[14:39:50] <mechano> i think im missing something about what makes a good language, or a good program, or something
[14:40:15] <[exa]> did you do any computational complexity theory?
[14:40:16] <mechano> seems like theres something to do with compiler complexity, ie not just a big matrix
[14:40:34] <[exa]> inverting compilers is NP
[14:40:37] <mechano> [exa] i never heard of it, so im guessing not, but the ideas are probably familiar
[14:40:57] <[exa]> (ok maybe much harder than NP)
[14:41:08] <mechano> [exa] thats basically impossibly hard, iiuc
[14:41:53] <[exa]> yeah it very easily belongs to some class of problems that you just can't expect to solve in humane times
[14:41:53] <mechano> so you need to use the spec to give the lexer and parser (compiler), and not try to infer the spec from the compiler? is that what your saying?
[14:42:19] <[exa]> lexer and parser _are_ the compiler
[14:42:24] <mechano> how is that to do with what makes a good language?

[14:49:54] <mechano> what am i looking for?
[14:49:57] <[exa]> anyway there is no good metric on how to measure this AFAIK, especially not with bijections and linear algebra because the "expansion" process is just wicked complex
[14:50:24] <[exa]> yeah that was my anti-example to "compress program size"
[14:50:45] <mechano> i guess trying to understand what makes a language good would be like trying to understand the "most common shaped programs" or something
[14:51:14] <[exa]> Haskell does the expansion basically by embedding a few layers of extra logic above the actual program logic and programmer may exploit these to do complicated stuff in the lower layers quickly

[14:58:04] <johnjaye> specifically i tried to run ministg and got the error [__1] unknown package: monads-tf (dependency of ministg)

[14:58:53] <mechano> the point being just that repitition & variation as a grammer for drumpattens is kind of rationalizable. but i still cant understand how that idea carries over to haskell, about what programs we can expect, and how this governs the language we end up using
[14:59:36] *** Joins: sheb (~sheb@31.223.228.71)
[14:59:43] <mechano> but i suppose most languages dont even have functions as first class citizens, so i guess they are way behind
[14:59:56] <mechano> i wonder how impactful all of this stuff is
[15:00:04] <mechano>  /important
[15:00:04] <[exa]> mechano: spoiler: the idea doesn't really carry easily to haskell. If you are trying to determine how humans perceive the haskell programs and why it is nice for them, you'll need to go super deep to neuroscience and you might have like 20 years of work to do, likely getting 2 or 3 PhDs in the process :D
[15:00:33] <mechano> huh, then i might be able to describe it nicely
[15:01:00] <mechano> without resorting to category theoretic string theory constructions!
[15:01:14] <mechano> *muhaha* - ok im offski

[15:01:58] <[exa]> johnjaye: `cabal update` didn't fix that? (that downloads a new database of packages)
[15:02:00] <johnjaye> er... so ghcup just downloads binaries?
[15:02:06] <johnjaye> [exa]: correct
[15:02:33] <johnjaye> it printed Downloading the latest package list from hackage.haskell.org then returned
[15:03:06] <[exa]> if it still fails then, I'd expect some realistic versioning problems that might be fixed with newer cabal, but I don't know much of the packages, really guessing now
[15:03:31] <[exa]> ghcup is kinda like rustup, it downloads you a working environment, puts everything in the $PATH right, and provides an easy tool to get newer versions of the tools
[15:03:42] <johnjaye> you know as much as i do.

[20:54:38] <ski> hm, so if we have at least two parts, at least one of them containing at least two elements (iow `emb' being non-injective), then there's an `f' that doesn't respect the partition
[20:54:53] <EvanR> it's a functor between two categories of endomorphisms
