[16:54:14] <Deide> Re: dependency injection. Mark Seemann is mentioned because he has a talk about the subject. Here's one: https://youtu.be/cxs7oLGrxQ4
[16:55:13] <Deide> If you search his name, he's done the talk a few times, and one or two follow up talks too
[16:58:18] <biberu> he also has a good book on di in c#
[19:00:10] <MatthiasVance> Does this kind of code make you happy? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/uJ2neKvI/image.png
[20:02:03] <MatthiasVance> I wonder how people in this channel are doing F# professionally, full-time
[21:27:28] <akronymus[m]> MatthiasVance: in our dreams, sadly
[21:27:48] <MatthiasVance> I might be the only one? :o
[22:55:22] <Deide> Yeah, no professional F# for me either, but I do keep bringing it up at work, so maybe one day
[23:55:23] <MatthiasVance> Come work for us! :D We do F#!
[23:56:50] <MatthiasVance> Also C# and Java positions available etc.. ML .. we do cool and fun stuff
[23:57:07] <MatthiasVance> And aren't a big company
[23:57:14] <MatthiasVance> I guess .. 40 people now?
[23:57:26] <MatthiasVance> Remote-first too :)
