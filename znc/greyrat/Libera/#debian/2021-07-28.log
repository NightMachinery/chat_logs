[01:02:14] <jasonwc> mattb0ne, I had to use the kernel from backports for the i7-9700K so I'm almost certain you'll at least need a new kernel

[01:03:12] *** Joins: Tokamak (~Tokamak@mobile-166-170-29-75.mycingular.net)
[01:03:33] <greycat> bullseye is using 5.10, so if that's not new enough, you may have to build your own kernel.  or use something besides Debian, in the worst case.
[01:05:01] <jasonwc> Phronix bencharmked that CPU under kernel 5.8
[01:05:03] <jasonwc> https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=celeron-pentium-cometlake&num=1
[01:05:46] <jasonwc> "All testing was off Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with all systems at their maximum rated memory frequency and dual channel configuration, 525GB Crucial CT525MX3 storage, and running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS while upgrading to the Linux 5.8 Git kernel."
[01:06:41] <PMT> I still think bullseye will do it.
[01:07:03] <jasonwc> yeah, he should try a live image
[01:07:06] <greycat> did they not *try* bullseye yet?  were they using buster with a backported kernel, and no other backports?
[01:07:13] <jasonwc> Is the problem that it won't boot or you don't get graphics?
[01:07:23] <PMT> the problem is not getting hardware acceleration.
[01:07:55] <greycat> you'll typicall need more than just a backported kernel for that
[01:08:17] <jasonwc> wouldn't you need a new xorg too?
[01:08:25] <PMT> I also linked a thread of someone with a same-generation intel chip saying none of this worked and bullseye did. :P
[01:08:27] <greycat> yes, and mesa, and possibly firmware
[01:08:42] <jasonwc> Yeah, so he should just try on Bullseye as PMT says, and it'll probably just work
[01:08:50] <greycat> if it were my machine, I would definitely try bullseye
[01:09:00] <jasonwc> This is one of the areas where Ubuntu LTS is nice.  They backport all that stuff.
[01:09:35] <jasonwc> We're ~3 weeks away.  It's not going to change very much.
[01:09:56] <PMT> Do they? They offer backported kernel, but I thought they didn't bump versions much post-release either.
[01:10:36] <jasonwc> When I last read about how their LTS process worked, they indicated that they backported xorg and mesa with the kernel to support new hardware
[01:14:04] <PMT> I see them cutting new xorg packages for the HWE, but the version numbers don't immediately seem to have gone up, just grown a suffix, so it's hard to know what churned.

[01:34:06] <sney> Stonefruit: anything in ~/.local/bin would have been placed there by you, or something you ran, so removing it won't cause any system-wide issues. however, it might have been placed there for a reason, ^

[01:34:23] <dpkg> wodim ("write optical disk media") is a <DFSG> compliant fork of <cdrecord>, part of <cdrkit> and available in the wodim package.  See http://lwn.net/Articles/198171/ for the release notice.  Use -pad for .wav files when burning audio.  Use -swab if your CDR uses little endian or .cdr is in big endian -- basically if the audio on CD is static, use -swab.

[01:36:04] <Stonefruit> PMT, sney: yes, I was hoping to figure what the reason could be :) I guess it has something to do with qemu, what I use but rarely. I'll leave it there for now

[01:45:49] <jelly> I lost interest in burning media on linux since most free apps were so bad at it with burner hw and meia I had available.  Led to a quicker adoption of usb sticks.
[01:46:27] <xx> well I hope it will still work, I need to burn 1 file on a cd
[01:46:31] <jelly> basically the only vendor knowledgeable enough to try make things work reliably was J. Schilling, and he... did not work well with Debian people
[01:46:40] <PMT> tbh i found the available Free software perfectly servicable I just stopped having a need for media
[01:46:43] <PMT> s/Debian//
[01:47:36] <jelly> you either got very lucky with hw + media combo or did not have high expectations
[01:48:13] <PMT> I must have been extraordinarily lucky, then, because I used a number of different random burners and media and it worked fine for me.

[01:57:47] <jasonwc> The advertised life expectancy did not hold in my case
[01:58:18] <PMT> I had one or two discs that were unreadable, but the vast majority worked great.
[01:58:29] <jasonwc> After how long?
[01:58:45] <PMT> The oldest were 10+ years?
[01:59:07] <jasonwc> not bad. 
[01:59:44] <PMT> Fortunately, in a somewhat improbable outcome, I had a friend with an automated optical media jukebox for bulk-reading discs.
[02:00:02] <PMT> (The drives and Linux were ordinary consumer stuff, just the loading/unloading involved clever machinery.)
[02:00:19] <jasonwc> Anyway, I"m glad CD-R/DVD-R went away in favor of HDD storage.  It was silly trying to hit an exact size target for x264 encodes.  CRF is faster and yields a consistent quality, but that wasn't feasible if you were limited to an exact size.

[06:58:51] <mattb0ne> tried the same thing doesn't work 
[06:59:01] <mattb0ne> my bit of googling says this has to do with the mDNS
[06:59:22] <mattb0ne> when I plug in the ethernet cord from the SBC it never connects

[06:59:36] <jhutchins> !doesn't work
[06:59:36] <dpkg> "Doesn't work" is a vague statement.  Does it sit on the couch all day long?  Does it procrastinate doing the dishes?  Does it beg on the street for change?  Please be specific!

Ask me about <smart questions>, <sicco> and <errors>.
[06:59:38] <mattb0ne> so something is funky with the connection
[07:00:25] <mattb0ne> when I say connect I get a icon in the system tray with an active connection 
[07:00:46] <mattb0ne> on the computer that cannot connect that does not happen. I cannot ping

[07:02:59] <jhutchins> Is the interface up? Does it have an address?  Can you ping localhost?  Can you ping another computer in your netowrk by IP address?  Can you resolve the hostname you're using to try to connect?  Have you tried updating your /etc/hosts file to match the hostname and the IP address?

[12:00:55] <dob1> in the dir I am doing this I can create new files
[12:01:30] <rudi_s> dob1: sudo runs as root but ">" redirects as your user.
[12:01:40] <dob1> ah ok, got it
[12:01:43] <rudi_s> It should work if the directory is writable by you.
[12:01:53] <dob1> I have to become root then
[12:02:06] <rudi_s> So use something like head ... | sudo tee file1 >/dev/null
[12:02:16] <rudi_s> Or run it as root, yes.
[12:03:35] <dob1> it seems more simple to become root

[15:03:26] <PMT> The one on bullseye does as I described.
[15:03:27] <dob1> it's the same as bullseye
[15:03:43] <Khepra> PMT: you mean when you add --color=always on debian, it also shows empty lines?
[15:03:46] <PMT> It does.
[15:03:57] <PMT> (show empty lines)
[15:04:06] <Khepra> it works fine for me on bullseye. shows grepped content, colored red.
[15:04:19] <Khepra> y'all have broken $TERM or sumfin?
[15:04:41] <PMT> Not obviously.
[15:04:56] <miko> out of curiosity, what is your $TERM?
[15:05:09] <Khepra> urxvt here, TERM=rxvt-unicode-256color over ssh to debian bullseye server
[15:05:45] <Khepra> or to deconfuse what I said .... that TERM is on the debian bullseye server, over tmux, over ssh, from gentoo client running rxvt

[15:22:32] <Khepra> PMT: oh so it's something deeper than just the term?
[15:23:01] <PMT> Apparently.
[15:23:38] <miko> hmm, despite the fact that the vc4 module is loaded, glxgears uses llvmpipe
[15:23:40] <miko> weird
[15:23:45] <PMT> I would assume it's related to why grep without --color=always decides not to color in this case.
[15:23:49] <Zr40> Khepra: nothing too exotic. It's a bunch of servers, running postgres, python and nginx.
[15:24:05] <Khepra> PMT: but I used rxvt on debian (buster and bullseye) even directly (not over ssh/tmux) and never had grep color issues
[15:24:16] <Khepra> so I wonder what could be the reason for this
[15:24:19] <PMT> Sure.
[15:24:48] <Khepra> Zr40: I pushed some servers in prod to bullseye, but not yet the ones with postgres, python and nginx, so I can't tell you how well that works.
[15:25:36] <Khepra> Zr40: actually... one test server with postgres and nginx is alraedy bullseyed; no problems seen, upgrade went smooth esp for 11->13 postgres; but it's not under active use so I don't know if there's edge cases.

[15:30:20] <Khepra> Zr40: oh also... python 3.7->3.9 upgrade is the one I'm holding off due to our apps not being compatible with 3.9.  that's the only big issue so far I've seen
[15:30:51] <Zr40> as for something else. These servers are currently still on stretch (lack of assigned time, but that's been solved). Should I upgrade via buster or can I go directly to bullseye? (Reinstalling if it breaks isn't a problem)
[15:30:56] <Khepra> but the issue is in OUR code. dependent libraries (we use PyPi, not packaged python libs in debian) all have upgrades and apparently support 3.9
[15:31:36] <Khepra> Zr40: skipping a release is not supported, so go stretch->buster->bullseye

[17:58:25] <kirk781> Apart from systemd, it's quite ahem, identical to Debian in many ways{including the fact that it's repos also hold older software like Debian's :p}
[17:59:47] <PMT> Given that I think its definition is something like "Debian minus systemd", it would be something of a deviation from expectations if they started throwing in package updates for fun.

[18:00:17] <miko> devuan is pretty much just debian with official support for other inits + some patched packages. i believe they even download the packages that aren't patched from the debian mirrors rather than from their own
[18:00:25] <miko> i could be wrong regarding that, though
[18:01:30] <PMT> I do not think any official Debian mirrors are in the end system's sources.list.
[18:01:32] <kirk781> They throw in support for non free firmware in their official release; hence it atleast installed properly without needing a wired internet connection
[18:01:37] <kirk781> PMT, nope
[18:02:44] <PMT> (I only know this because we had someone come through the other day with a problem that turned out to be them using Devuan and lying about it, badly, and then they said rude things after I answered their question anyway.)

[18:02:55] <kirk781> I would need to download one of the non official ISO's of Debian to get it to boot into a GUI so that it atleast detects an internet connection. Also, does the netinstall version detect wireless connections for the installation to proceed?
[18:03:23] *** Joins: Cyp (~cyp@192038128058.mbb.telenor.dk)
[18:03:49] <kirk781> PMT, I installed it the other day and it hasn't given much issues. Most of the issues can be solved by reading the Debian wiki or if nothing, the Arch Wiki :p
[18:04:08] <PMT> Sure, the problem wasn't with Devuan.
[18:04:33] <PMT> THe problem was that they might have been trying to crossgrade? It wasn't entirely clear how they wound up in the position they were in, because they were lying.
[18:05:41] <kirk781> PMT, Does Debian's netinstall image include support for wireless connections/drivers for the installation to proceed or is a wired connection needeD?
[18:06:29] <kirk781> Debian won't even boot into a GUI and no amount of fiddling with helped when installing the official Xfce based{I assume} installation media
[18:06:43] <PMT> I don't recall the last time I tried installing Debian with a wireless connection, sorry.

[20:24:36] <zerowalker> Khepra, yeah that was my take on it as well, and cause of that i haven't really thought about it, as it's not even in apt anyway (not sure if it couldn't be for some reason)
[20:27:14] <zerowalker> tbh i don't really know how snap works, i thought it was just like "apt" but it was more isolated and with user privileges mostly, as it "simulates" the normal structures, but then i think i read that snap contains some minimal "ubuntu kernel", so i my view got a reality slash
[20:28:35] <furrymcgee> snap is just another linux container daemon
[20:28:43] <zerowalker> out of curiosity,  does debian have some "lxd alternative"? i find the "run a minimal os in a container" to be quite a big thing that i have missed out on

[22:02:12] <mattb0ne> beagle iso
[22:02:31] <PMT> I mean, vanilla buster is also on kernel 4.XX, you'd have to be more specific.
[22:02:37] <mattb0ne> i think there is a reason there kernel is downgraded. I think you can use your own image but it would be a lot of work
[22:02:58] <mattb0ne> how long ago is stretch

[22:07:35] <SymbioticFemale> its insecure by default. their ISO images have hardcoded passwords and are listening on every possible medium from serial/USB/ssh with password, etc
[22:07:51] <jhutchins> SymbioticFemale: Bullshit.
[22:08:02] <sney> you could probably get a minimal fairly-plain debian image by booting the factory iso and using debootstrap from there, then copying whatever basic bootloader mojo over 
[22:08:05] <jhutchins> SymbioticFemale: None of that is true.
[22:08:16] <SymbioticFemale> jhutchins: the beaglebone.org images?
[22:08:57] <SymbioticFemale> the MOTD upon serial access literally contains the root password
[22:09:18] <jhutchins> SymbioticFemale: You didn't specify.  I am referring to amt64 stretch.  It would surprise me if that were true of beaglebone, but I suppose it's possible.  Live images pretty much have to have default logins.

[22:57:52] <greycat> I missed the start of this, but there is no way that an "un-mounted server" counts for any kind of space tallying.
[22:58:34] <PMT> Copying things to where you thought a filesystem was mounted and it wasn't does take up space.

[22:59:14] <Khepra> if that's ncdu output for _unmounted_ /mnt, then maybe there was some copying done, thinkin /mnt was mounted and it wasn't so it all ended up back on the rootfs

[23:02:40] <PMT> Siamand_: the key thing you should understand is that this most likely happened because you tried to copy things to something that was mounted in /mnt/ when it wasn't mounted, so it did not end up on that filesystem, and now you have deleted the copy of it that ended up on /'s filesystem.

[23:48:09] <joo-_> but in xfce under settings i think they got something also to add a printer
[23:48:10] <xx> nothing responds on localhost on that port
[23:48:30] <joo-_> ah ok maybe you dont have the cupsys, but i think its pretty easy in xfce
[23:49:08] <xx> a link to a debian guide would suffice for now, they all look very outdated. Or a wiki page (the debian wiki has terrible search)
[23:49:10] <joo-_> but if not, can You look to install cupsys server on the system and try port 631, it has nice interface for controlling the printers

[23:50:16] <joo-_> i think its just apt-get install cups, maybe you didnt select during installation

[23:57:27] <xx> I think I got confused during installation because it said "print server"
[23:57:42] <xx> and my computer is not a "server" to which other "clients" would connect to print
