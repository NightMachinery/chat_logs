[02:20:29] <trevoke> sachac: the clocktable code seems fairly rigid; I'm also looking at the org-collector module but that also seems rigid. If I can take the output of the clocktable block as, maybe, the input to another code block on which I can run the transpose function, I may have a shot?
[02:20:59] <trevoke> I'm after what seems to be the holy grail of clocktable reporting: a report with times aggregated/summed by a given property (or tag)

[14:09:26] <thblt> Emacs sometimes pop regular buffers in the minibuffer. For example, if I press C-x g (magit-status) while browsing files for C-x f, the magit status buffer appears in the minibuffer.  Is there a general way to prevent this?

[14:15:43] <thblt> theothornhill: vertico.  Let me try with something else.
[14:16:19] <thblt> I have the issue even with vertico disabled. Maybe something in my config.
[14:16:40] <theothornhill> thblt: just tried with vertico, works fine here too.  Tried with mct and vertico
[14:17:06] <theothornhill> must be config, I think? Maybe some display-buffer-same-window thing?
[14:17:20] <thblt> Maybe my shackle config.  
[14:17:35] <theothornhill> probably
[14:18:20] <thblt> Yes. Ok, it's because :same t.  I need a blanket ban on :same t when the minibuffer is the active window.
[14:19:26] <theothornhill> yeah! I tried once just using display-buffer-same-window as a default action, but that caused all sorts of weird behavior with magit
[14:20:04] <theothornhill> In general emacs is popping up buffers all around, and I can't seem to get the hang of how it works :)
[14:21:37] <thblt> Shackle works well, except for that bug.  I found how to fix it, I just need to decide what to do. other-window?

[17:28:14] <dharju> hi. i'm trying to edit a latex-block in org-mode using org-edit-special, but it's telling me there's no special environment there. i'm using "#+begin_latex latex" followed by "#+end_latex". i added "latex" after "#+begin_latex" in order to get syntax highlighting in the block. anyone else experienced this issue?
[17:28:40] <grym> dharju: i suspect #+begin_src latex might work 
[17:28:48] <dharju> oddly enough, it works if i add latex-code inside the block and then try org-edit-special.

[19:18:57] <bkhl> black is the type of formatter that always gives the same output for the same syntactic content.
[19:19:12] <bkhl> So you can make a lint job based on whether the code matches that formatter or not.
[19:19:52] <bkhl> I really like having that style of formatter in our CI at work, it removes the need for a whole class of useless conversations.
[19:19:53] <grym> Bayes: yes, black.

[19:21:49] <grym> (because pre-commit will compel you to not care)
[19:22:51] <Bayes> so does it change the format only for the committed code, i.e., you can still have your own crap style locally?
[19:23:18] <bkhl> Theoretically, but then you'd have to maintain that formatting separately somehow.
[19:23:19] <Bayes> I don't think what I asked makes sense really
[19:23:44] <bkhl> Reapplying your own formatting from other people's patches would be a bit of a pain.
[19:23:47] <Bayes> ok so in the end you don't end up with different local copies
[19:24:11] <bkhl> No, at work we mainly just use "format on save" in our respective editors.
[19:24:23] <Bayes> so you code in whatever style you like, then you blacken, you commit, and voila the code is all neat
[19:24:29] <bkhl> I do it through LSP with Eglot, but I assume blacken.el can also do that.
[19:24:31] <Bayes> gotcha
[19:24:41] <bkhl> So I also write Python very sloppily and then just save to format.

[19:27:04] <bkhl> On the CI side I actually run it as part of the test suite, with a plugin to pytest
[19:27:25] <bkhl> So formatting checks also show up as warnings in Junit XML reports etc.
[19:27:27] <grym> Bayes: if you apply black in CI, then whatever you commit will be blacked no matter what you wrote
[19:27:39] <grym> pre-commit will change your source code for you on disk before it's ever committed
[19:27:48] <grym> this either freaks you out, or not 
[19:28:35] <grym> i start new projects as black-only, so i never have the "oh god formatting commit" problem 
[19:29:05] <bkhl> Git has things now to ignore certain commits in blames though, that work reasonably well.
[19:29:11] <bkhl> But it's a bit of work to set it up for each project.
[19:29:24] <grym> yep, that's very helpful if you can get the team and be like "OK today is the fuck develop day"
[19:29:43] <grym> it gets rough when you have 6 feature branches

[21:10:34] <abrahms> I've been consistenly disappointed with this osx laptop since I got it. Work, unfortunately, doesn't support linux for developers (and have things which are impassable without their support).  Just today I had to re-plug my display cable 5 times to get it to pick up my display (despite not being disconnected since yesterday)
[21:11:18] <cvandusen> and that display works fine with other laptops?
[21:11:19] <thblt> abrahms: bad cable? I'm all for hating Apple and all that, but external display support isn't exactly one of their weaknesses.
[21:11:50] <TRS-80> abrahms: I have heard increasing displeasure from Apple power users since years now about the direction the company seems to be heading.  FWIW.
[21:12:12] <abrahms> thblt: So the laptop technically supports 2 displays. It has worked in the past. If I plug in both displays w/ USBC cords, they don't consistently work. Sometimes one works, sometimes the other. I've swapped cables between them and that doesn't appear to be a determining factor.
[21:12:28] <thblt> Weird.

[21:35:49] <epolanski> SO I guess that it is normal that if I f C-x 5 2 no new frame appears and nothing happens right? only one frame is supported in terminal mode

[21:39:02] <bpalmer> epolanski: I'm not sure the full context, but frames work for me in non-windowed emacs on linux; it's just that as I switch frames (with C-x 5 o), each frame is always the full size of the terminal

[21:43:45] <bpalmer> elisp is a lisp-2 where functions and variables occupy different namespaces.

[21:44:29] <abrahms> krux02: yes. As previously mentioned, I have gotten them to work a few times, but it's very inconsistent. Both cords are usb-c cords and which one I use has no bearing on which monitor decides to work.

[21:45:13] <bpalmer> krux02_: that's another way of thinking about the namespaces,  yes.
[21:45:28] <krux02_> in other words, when you pass 'mysomthing to a function, you pass in both the value and the function
[21:45:32] <bpalmer> (And it's closer to the way it's implemented: a symbol has multiple slots, including a value slot and a function slot)
[21:45:33] <krux02_> (if it exists)

[22:17:37] <pingpongball> :)
[22:18:08] <thblt> Well, I'm no wizard, but the eintr and elisp manuals are good starters.
[22:18:27] <thblt> eintr is the starter, elisp is a reference.
[22:18:37] <TRS-80> Well thing about high level wizards is that they are very busy.  So I will answer instead.  :)  Start with Tutorial, then Elisp Tutorial.  Then start writing some things you find personally useful.  And study sources of packages you use and try and figure out how they work.  Try and track down bugs.  You can also learn a lot just hanging around in here.
[22:18:52] <pingpongball> so if i learn from those , would i be able to make packages like nyan-cat , beacon ?:)
[22:18:59] <pingpongball> or do i need more
[22:19:06] <TRS-80> basics of Elisp are actually quite easy

[23:38:42] <TRS-80> bpalmer: I thought rudybot had posted that at first
[23:38:43] <bpalmer> akk: if there is no mark set, you'll get an error "The mark is not set now, so there is no region." I think otherwise, you would get a stale set of values (depending on tranasient mark mode)

[23:40:04] <akk> Oh, duh, I should have just tested that. It doesn't seem to cause an error, and the function says the non-region is not a url which is the right answer.
[23:40:50] <akk> Maybe it's giving me a zero-length region at point.
[23:41:43] <bpalmer> (you'll get the "the mark is not set now" if you had never set the region in the buffer)

[23:42:26] <akk> And my theory about them both being point is wrong, or at least, (= start end) isn't true.
[23:43:17] <bpalmer> The region is defined as the stuff between (point) and (mark)

[23:43:47] <bpalmer> when the region goes away (e.g., because you're using transient-mark-mode), the mark and point functions still have values; but region-active-p returns nil
[23:43:56] <akk> I must be getting a default mark somehow, because if I quit and restart emacs, it still doesn't give me an error.

[23:46:22] <quippy> hey folks I'm suddenly having an issue where exec-path-from-shell is giving me a stale version of my PATH and IDK what's going on; has anybody seen this before, or could help me troubleshoot?
[23:46:57] <akk> hmm, now I'm getting it everywhere. Maybe I'd left something in my previous function (which I just deleted from .emacs) that was setting the mark.
