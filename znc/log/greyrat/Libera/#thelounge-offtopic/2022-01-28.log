[07:32:00] <johncs> XMPP and especially Matrix are fairly mature and popular alternatives to IRC
[07:32:10] <johncs> are there any other big names?
[07:33:24] <xnaas> email? /s
[07:33:44] <xnaas> Mattermost is probably more common than one might suspect
[07:33:52] <xnaas> large market for self-hostable Slack
[07:34:25] <johncs> oh interesting, yeah i'd bet
[07:34:34] <johncs> I'm planning to integrate chat into a saas product I work on later this year and I'm just trying to get my mind thinking through what I'll do
[07:34:51] <xnaas> oh there' suh
[07:34:55] <xnaas> oh there's uh**
[07:34:56] <xnaas> shit
[07:34:58] <xnaas> lemme think
[07:35:58] <xnaas> not rocket.chat
[07:36:22] <xnaas> zulip
[07:36:24] <xnaas> that's the one
[07:36:29] <xnaas> https://github.com/zulip/zulip
[07:38:00] <johncs> oh very cool. the problems their focused on isn't relevant to my product, so i think they'd be a bad fit, but i do remember seeing that project forever ago and it seemed cool then. seems cool now. i like the idea of trying to better support async chat.
[07:38:28] <johncs> thank you for showing me it
[07:39:20] <johncs> i'll probably end up using matrix. imma feel like I'm cheating on IRC while I implement it though ðŸ˜­
[07:39:32] <xnaas> XMPP ftw
[07:39:40] <xnaas> pretty sure it's purpose is being built into shit
[07:39:43] <xnaas> and then not federated
[07:39:44] <xnaas> :P
[07:40:06] <johncs> haha i haven't written it off tbh, but probably not :P
[07:45:17] <xnaas> Sounds horribly bloated. ðŸ˜¬
[07:53:46] <johncs> I haven't heard good things... but tbh a lot of great tech is like that ðŸ˜…. Hard problems are hard. Sometimes quite good solutions are still kinda shit.
[07:58:14] <xnaas> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[07:58:58] <xnaas> idk, I endure a lot of suffering to self-host my own shit and be degoogled and such, but every time I touch anything Matrix-related I want to puke :P
[07:59:19] <xnaas> I mean shit, I put up with IRC! ;P

[16:09:55] <xnaas> If it's not federated, I don't think the storage would be *that* bad.
[16:29:51] <bookworm> if you're not federating then why use matrix?
[16:30:09] <bookworm> there are way simpler protocols then
