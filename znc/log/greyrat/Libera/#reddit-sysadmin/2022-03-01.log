[00:00:10] <PublicWifi> i love TOR
[00:00:17] <PublicWifi> @NinjaStyle long story short...
[00:00:23] <PublicWifi> I have 2 buildings, A and B
[00:00:39] <PublicWifi> B is new, and I'm getting the network bridged to building A using some unifi wireless bridges
[00:00:59] <PublicWifi> our APs have 2 SSIDs, only is prod stuff so VLAN1, and the other is guest, so VLAN 2 for instance
[00:01:17] <PublicWifi> user was able to get a vlan 2 dhcp lease from the main building, and then go down to the new building and connect to the wifi
[00:01:28] <PublicWifi> and his device was able to pass traffic using his vlan 2 lease
[00:01:44] <PublicWifi> even though the bridge hasn't been changed to allow anything besides VLAN 1 tags
[00:02:39] <PublicWifi> a took a new device down there and tried to connect to the vlan 2 wifi (one that didn't already have a lease) and it worked as expected and wasn't able to get a lease or pass traffic
[00:04:30] <PublicWifi> I didn't think vlans were technically routing
[00:04:49] <PublicWifi> i mean I guess that would make sense if his device already had an IP and shit, if it was just routing at that point since its a differnet subnet 
[00:05:49] <thegodsquirrel> Is that building only supposed to have the guest SSID available?
[00:08:26] <PublicWifi> nah its supposed to have both

[00:09:17] <PublicWifi> man you would have though I shit in the floor with the reaction I got by telling all the c-levels to move their IoT and personal devices to teh guest network lol
[00:09:26] <PublicWifi> sorry bro you don't need Apple TV on the prod network
[00:09:51] <sintax> pfft
[00:09:53] <sintax> what do you know
[00:09:59] <PublicWifi> lolol
[00:10:05] <sintax> i'd set up a raspberry pi some where and let you wonder where it is connected. 
[00:10:13] <sintax> and have it randomly ping your machine. 
[00:10:23] <fritzwastaken> wasnt there a reddit post about a random pi found behind a printer?
[00:10:24] <signofzeta> PublicWifi: Mostly.  Unless someone uses it to show a presentation in the board room.  Then you'll hear about it for sure.  That's an edge case, though.
[00:10:40] <sintax> and make it send you random messages through cmd prompt
[00:10:42] <PublicWifi> we have dedicated machines setup for that
[00:10:43] <thegodsquirrel> Heh, plug it into the secondary port on one of the Unifi APs he will never find it
[00:10:50] <PublicWifi> LOL
[00:10:51] <sintax> ^^
[00:10:53] <PublicWifi> oh Ill find it
[00:10:57] <sintax> hahaha
[00:10:57] <PublicWifi> :D
[00:10:58] <signofzeta> Who needs a Pi, fritzwastaken?  HP's printers had "Faxsploit" which let you install code in the flash via the phone line.
[00:11:08] <sintax> haha
[00:11:11] <sintax> not that's hackerman
[00:11:16] <sintax> going back to phone lines
[00:11:22] <sintax> brb
[00:11:26] <signofzeta> fax machines are basically interpreters
[00:11:43] <PublicWifi> the idea that fax is considered HIPAA compliant is retarded
[00:11:51] <signofzeta> And who can forget the classic buffer overflow on the old HP LaserJets that let you write a message to the 16-character screen?
[00:11:53] <PublicWifi> technically anyone on the line can grab the data and demodulate it
[00:11:53] <thegodsquirrel> it makes perfect sense
[00:12:17] <sd> 02<d​eer> And yet, pharmacy sends orders via fax all the time
[00:12:21] <PublicWifi> same
[00:12:29] <PublicWifi> we do medical billing and most hospitals make us fax shit
[00:12:39] <fritzwastaken> signofzeta: at my last job I made the screen say "Insert Coin" Our poor very very foreign accounting lady was very confused and came to the help desk asking about the coins
[00:12:41] <PublicWifi> cause otherwise they'd have to go thrugh the netsec team's stipulations and its a hallse
[00:12:47] <PublicWifi> hassle*
[00:12:51] <thegodsquirrel> Once you make it digital a whole new level of hell comes down on you
[00:12:55] <PublicWifi> yup
[00:13:14] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> big fax at it again
[00:13:16] <thegodsquirrel> And doctors are cheap mother fuckers
[00:13:18] <PublicWifi> lol
[00:13:23] <sd> 02<d​eer> I think hospital admins are all just 80 and don't want to let go of their precious fax service
[00:13:31] <signofzeta> fritzwastaken: I almost used that hack to "find" printers missing from our inventory by making it say "CALL IT DEPT".  My boss thought it was a great idea, but later changed his mind.
[00:13:38] <PublicWifi> that and it literally gets around digital hipaa rules
[00:13:47] <fritzwastaken> lol nice signofzeta 
[00:13:49] <PublicWifi> its honestly a lot easier than having to deal with email encryption services and shi
[00:14:02] <sd> 02<d​eer> Yeah, that's fair
[00:14:02] <fritzwastaken> Im so happy I only have to worry about 4 printers
[00:14:03] <signofzeta> in the US, at least.  Australia (and I think Japan) have decided faxing is not secure.

[02:40:36] <SleePy> Well just heard of a issue that takes the cake for the week.  Shipping's main printer ran out of toner, so they contact purchasing and get a new toner sent.  They throw out the old one.  The toner comes in.  Its the right part (hard to mess this up with Ricoh having you select which printer your ordering parts for).  But they didn't remove just the toner.  Somehow they removed the drum.. Printer is only 1 year old..

[03:26:30] <signofzeta> sideup66: No, but I had interviews with different sets of managers so they could get a feel for me.
[03:27:03] <sideup66> interesting
[03:27:32] <sideup66> yeah this was like a panel of managers with positions is how im understanding it, idk how to feel but then again, any market literally makes 0 sense right now
[03:27:58] <signofzeta> Yeah, we had one or two people doing hiring for the whole company, so it's not exactly like your situation.
[03:28:10] <estranger> sideup66 nope heh
[03:28:50] <estranger> we put you through rapid sure fire interviews but it's for a specific job.. if we don't think you're a fit we might refer you to another position 
[03:28:58] <estranger> -sure
[03:29:06] <estranger> think that's pretty standard
[03:29:27] <estranger> I like to know what I'm interviewing for heh
[03:34:41] <sideup66> right
[03:34:46] <sideup66> yeah its a few positions
[03:34:50] <sideup66> im not sure how to feel with this
[03:34:52] <Cl0udNinja> sideup66, I've had interviews where about halfway through they were like 'let me go get X' and it turns out X is a different team/department and they think that my skills would be better there. but rarely have I had a 'panel', though the place I'm at now, when the hiring process happened, I interviewed with all of the major people
[03:35:12] <sideup66> yeah, i have no idea what to expect
[03:35:32] <sideup66> it may not be panel like, its like 3-4 hiring managers
[03:35:34] <sideup66> its all one comapny
[03:35:40] <sideup66> so its not some staffing/recruiting bs
[03:35:44] <Cl0udNinja> yeah
[03:35:56] <sideup66> so im guessing they are looking for where im a fit
[03:36:32] <Cl0udNinja> where I'm at now, I had back-to-back interviews with all 3 of the engineering team leads, but it was more about cultural fit than anything

[05:00:22] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> Sorry you're going through that though
[05:00:42] <doubletwist> Though I'm a little concerned - I'm not getting the response rate I'd hoped for on the positions I've applied for. Not sure what I'm doing wrong or missing that they are looking for.
[05:00:51] <doubletwist> I don't * think * my resume is all that bad :)
[05:01:32] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> Lot of it is HR bullshit, "they don't have X degree or Y certification", typically not jobs worth happening anyways. All you need is one good response

[05:01:55] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> I would say aim high, too. Its the ones you don't expect that reach back out to you.
[05:02:47] *** Joins: Emet-Selch (~haise01@user/haise01)
[05:03:13] <doubletwist> Yeah I'm not really aiming particularly high 
[05:03:44] <doubletwist> I have trouble discerning which requirements they *really* want and expect so I tend to err on the side of caution
[05:05:26] <doubletwist> I know for sure I'm somewhat hampered by my lack of experience with cloud and ci/cd - which seems to encompass 90% of the Linux sysadmin jobs I'm finding
[05:05:41] <doubletwist> Plus we used (and I love) saltstack - but everyone seems to want Ansible or Puppet
[05:07:35] <doubletwist> At least from a listed requirements standpoint, the openings I'm seeing seem to be mostly devops and heavily skewed toward the 'dev' side of things
[05:25:39] <mistiry> Traditional IT jobs are still out there, but the market is definitely trending toward the DevOps style roles
[05:26:51] <mistiry> One of the reasons I started learning and now work with some of these modern tools and processes. Love me some Terraform and Ansible.
[05:28:13] <doubletwist> I love Saltstack. And I'm not opposed to doing devops/cloud - just have very little practical experience with it - and other than what I learned to be able to manage Saltstack code in git/bitbucket, I don't come from a development background.

[05:28:39] <mistiry> I didnt either
[05:30:12] <doubletwist> I will say, based on a lot of what I've seen from devops teams and some of the horrible things they do (from an ops perspective) a lot of them could definitely use someone with more ops experience to help guide them to not do stupid things.
[05:30:16] <mistiry> I was sysadmin forever, until I changed jobs like 9 months ago. 
[05:30:46] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> what did you change to?
[05:31:07] <mistiry> DevOps Engineer would be the closest title that describes what im doing
[05:31:15] <doubletwist> Yeah I've done this for 26 years now. Definitely 'forever' in IT terms. :)
[05:31:21] <mistiry> technically my title is very dumb right now. "Systems Engineer, SRE (DevOps)"
[05:31:34] <technonerd> all the buzz words
[05:31:52] <doubletwist> I'd love to shift toward more DevOps - I was already slowly trying to turn this place in that direction - but it's a large, under-manned ship so hard to turn.
[05:31:53] <mistiry> doubletwist: bit longer than me, about 18 years 
[05:32:49] <doubletwist> Gonna be harder now that they are replacing the entire, experienced systems and network teams with a jr helpdesk team.

[05:35:42] <mistiry> downdetector has a few big names with outages. facebook, twitter, etc
[05:36:13] <doubletwist> Unfortunately for them, they have ZERO experience with Salt even though we told them they needed someone who knew it in order to manage our systems. 
[05:36:36] <mistiry> doubletwist: Honestly, Terraform is pretty easy to get started with. You dont have to worry about things like pipelines and such right away, and can introduce that later.

[12:36:26] <Guest23> I have a Windows Server 2019 with a SMB file share role. I have mapped it as a network drive on several Windows 10 machines. But whenever I right click a file or folder on that drive and click "properties", it takes at least 90 seconds (!!) for the Properties window to open. If i right click enough times, I can even get the drive to become
[12:36:26] <Guest23> disconnected from my computer. Besides that, the drive is responsive and behaves normally. What could be wrong? How to troubleshoot? Nothing useful in Event Log as far as I can tell

[12:48:34] <kerat58> but the context menu is slow on that same computer.
[12:48:44] <Guest23> yes
[12:49:12] <Guest23> not just slow, literally takes 2 minutes to right click properties
[12:50:17] <SirSceptalot> The folder it's in isn't compressed by any chance? Still shouldn't take so long though. It happens with a new blank text file as well?
[12:50:42] <kerat58> I had something similar happen a long time ago; and the reason was total BS, like sorting or grouping was re-running every single time you clicked anything in Explorer (I think)
[12:51:00] <kerat58> that's why the command line operations were fast, because those Explorer 'extras' aren't included
[12:51:09] <SirSceptalot> Also, is it only this one share? Have you tried setting up a second share directly under the drive and testing with that?
[12:52:40] <Cl0udNinja> can you turn off Access Time on windows / Windows SMB? that could have some affect, but probably not that drastic
[12:52:49] <Guest23> SirSceptalot no compression, happens with any file yes. I was initially thinking something might be blocked in the firewall, but that checked out. Could there be some issue with the server and the domain controller?
[12:52:53] <kerat58> also depends on number of items in the directory in question...
[12:53:04] <kerat58> large number of files in directory -> more problems 
[12:53:06] <Cl0udNinja> I know you can on linux, but idk if that applies on windows

[19:15:19] <koollman> best case, some config file is included and tries to load module that it shouldn't load. worst case, you're going to find out later that everything is borked and you can't rollback
[19:15:19] <teh_f4ll3n> all the site dbs are on a separate mysql 8 server
[19:15:40] <koollman> yeah. but you have the client part on the server, then
[19:16:15] <teh_f4ll3n> not like I'm deleting the old VM. the rollback is just a NIC switchover in vCentre :D
[19:16:21] <mistiry> yep. what if it has a vulnerability? what if you need to use sql later? what if there are other extensions with issues that wont be revealed until this one is resolved?
[19:16:33] <mistiry> also tons of unnecessary noise in the logs
[19:16:57] <mistiry> and the fix for that isnt to reduce the logging level to shut it up
[19:17:26] <koollman> teh_f4ll3n: unless data in the db got messed up
[19:17:26] <teh_f4ll3n> the migrator is smart enough to update the configs
[19:17:40] <teh_f4ll3n> the DBs are not being migrated
[19:17:49] <koollman> teh_f4ll3n: but the code accessing them is
[19:17:56] <mistiry> ok. you do you, boo boo :)
[19:18:00] <koollman> so, you have a db connector. and that part is probably the source of your warnings
[19:18:28] <teh_f4ll3n> nah, it's just the built-in sql engine that's not in use

[19:20:29] <teh_f4ll3n> so, it's just the migrator being extra informative I guess
[19:21:11] <teh_f4ll3n> yeah, the server I'm migrating has 7.3 as the latest
[19:21:50] <teh_f4ll3n> migrating everything to the platform that doesn't even have 7.3 included or available for install :D
[19:21:56] <Fossil> I have got old backends reappearing in my haproxy loadbalancers even after a restart and I cannot fucking figure it out. Too weird
[19:22:34] <teh_f4ll3n> but we did test everything on 8.0 and 8.1, so we know there will be minimal impact if any
[19:22:50] <arlion> a restart re-reads the config file. So any config changes done live to the haproxy sock are not persistent
[19:23:50] <arlion> first thing i always check, that seems to be a persistent issue with my haproxy is that i always check for two running processes.
[19:24:26] <arlion> For SOME reason. if i use haproxyctl and socket commands, haproxy will start a new parent ID EVEN WHEN THE HAPROXY PID IS SET

[19:31:00] <arlion> Like, im not trying to be a dick here. But I also know when you are in over your head and this is really a good learning opportunity. There are alot of great concepts at play here, and frankly i could spend an hour talking about just one of them.

[19:32:50] <arlion> This isn't a quick fix type of challenge. Ideally, there is already some technology someone already has in place that you just need to add a few additional lines to a config and it will start working for you

[19:59:08] <koollman> PublicWifi: grounding is important. at least some common ground to get the same reference ground everywhere, even if not actual ground (but of course it should be real grouunding if you can)
[19:59:15] <PublicWifi> okay side question

[20:00:43] <PublicWifi> at&t is involved but they are slow
[20:01:00] <PublicWifi> the gateway responds

[20:05:01] <thegodsquirrel> I know that ISP stuff can be a bit different sometimes
[20:05:02] <PublicWifi> nothing in the network rack is grounded with the case ground lugs, just from the power cables themselves

[20:19:36] <fritzwastaken> GROND!
[20:20:49] <teh_f4ll3n> I mean why not just ground to actual ground? why "center screw"?
[20:21:09] <PublicWifi> center screw is actual ground, and its nearby the rack
[20:21:23] <PublicWifi> shoving a ground wire into a ground hole of the outlet is retarded

[20:22:27] <fritzwastaken> Meanwhile a copper busbar is like... 50$ with all the mounting hardware
[20:22:30] <teh_f4ll3n> is it too soon for a minute of silence?
[20:22:53] <teh_f4ll3n> that's $50 he could spend on ANAL lube

[20:22:55] <PublicWifi> chrsit quit triggering me before I have a chance to leave teh desk LOL
[20:23:00] <PublicWifi> the bus bar has to be grounded SOMEWHERE
[20:23:06] <fritzwastaken> IPMB interface was TRIGGERED. 
[20:23:08] <PublicWifi> that literally doesn't help the idea lol
[20:23:10] <PublicWifi> LOL
[20:23:14] <PublicWifi> OKAY IM LEAVING NOW FOR REAL
[20:23:16] <PublicWifi> fritzwastaken loves buttsex in his butt
[20:23:46] <fritzwastaken> I dont think ive been in many server rooms that didnt have a busbar and a grounding solution
[20:23:52] <fritzwastaken> or a*
[20:24:10] <teh_f4ll3n> who said it was an actual server room?
[20:24:12] <fritzwastaken> its like not having cooling
[20:24:18] <fritzwastaken> tis true
[20:24:27] <teh_f4ll3n> y'all have cooling? :D
[20:24:36] <fritzwastaken> lol depends on the datacenter
[20:24:51] <shakygator> my first "server room" was just a closet with a retro fitted mr slim
[20:24:56] <shakygator> but no bussbar
[20:25:04] <shakygator> our next building was purpose built so it was much better
[20:25:05] <teh_f4ll3n> just playin'. Our datacentre is hella cold
[20:25:06] <fritzwastaken> oh yea, from my MSP days ive seen servers hidden under stairs
[20:25:24] <teh_f4ll3n> in enclosed space, with no ventilation
[20:25:24] <sd> 09<F​uzZzERD> That sounds delightful!
[20:25:31] <teh_f4ll3n> been there
[20:25:33] <teh_f4ll3n> seen that
[20:25:52] <fritzwastaken> my old MSP was hired by Purdue for one of their poultry processing plants
[20:26:04] <fritzwastaken> Occasionally feathers would get in there, it was hot as hell
[20:26:09] <sd> 09<F​uzZzERD> I worked at a place that had a server rack in a closet powered by an extension cord. Well, one day, IDK someone decided to run a big report or something, kicked the servers into high gear, and the extension cord melted and everything went down.
[20:26:12] <fritzwastaken> and you just heard chickens dying
[20:26:23] <sd> 09<F​uzZzERD> That is how I learned that our server rack was powered by an extension cord...
[20:26:41] <fritzwastaken> big oof
[20:26:43] <teh_f4ll3n> anyone monitoring the news for power outages, maccas causes
[20:26:45] <teh_f4ll3n> ?
[20:26:53] <fritzwastaken> half of Kentucky just goes offline
[20:27:12] <sd> 09<F​uzZzERD> are you suggesting that KFC is frying their chickens in a server closet?
[20:27:40] <fritzwastaken> lol no, but Purdue had a small network rack on top of the processing floor
[20:27:44] <fritzwastaken> and it was hot af up there
[20:29:19] <teh_f4ll3n> extension cords are fine if they're properly rated, not those flimsy 13A ones
[20:29:59] <fritzwastaken> But also make sure, that at the end of the extension cord, you have at least 2 power strips
[20:30:36] <teh_f4ll3n> daisy chained
[20:30:40] <teh_f4ll3n> :D
[20:30:42] <fritzwastaken> ofc
[20:31:06] <teh_f4ll3n> because who doesn't like electrical fires
[20:31:12] <fritzwastaken> Uuuugh how to robocallers get so many damned local phone numbers

[20:32:52] <fritzwastaken> smart

[23:18:38] <sintax> i'm sure you'll see some one go to recover it. 
[23:18:39] <vinrock> spend a few weeks diving for rims and then buy a house
[23:18:41] <DrZak> bugiatti are 45k
[23:18:46] <DrZak> bugatti
[23:18:48] <vinrock> yeah but theres no bugattis on the boat
[23:18:53] <sintax> bring the cars back. refurbish. sell for half price.
[23:18:57] <sintax> "minor water damage"
[23:19:03] <DrZak> they are
[23:19:13] <int0x1C8> there's almost no chance that it sank in a place that's divable by humans
[23:19:29] <DrZak> depends, there are some shallows there too
[23:19:37] <sintax> use a submarine
[23:19:38] <DrZak> shallow, as in 500-600m deep
[23:19:44] <sintax> if we can get to the titanic we can get a car
[23:20:10] <int0x1C8> humans can't scuba much beyond 100ft deep without doing saturation diving
[23:20:29] <sintax> humans are weak!
[23:20:33] <sintax> useless meat bags
[23:20:57] <DrZak> tbh. why humans?
[23:21:03] <kerat58> Not "minor water damage."  Think more positive.  Such as, "Baptized"
[23:21:06] <DrZak> just lower a giant magnet and fish it out
[23:21:28] <int0x1C8> and to even get to 100ft you need a shitload of training, rebreather, and heliox mix
[23:22:18] <sintax> kerat58: you got it right
[23:22:39] <int0x1C8> also if the tires were pressurized they've burst
[23:22:49] <sintax> i can afford tires
[23:22:53] <sintax> i cannot afford a lambop

[23:23:19] <sintax> yes it does
[23:23:20] <kerat58> plus I'm sure that the "repair kit" that comes with the car will be super helpful with the tyres
[23:23:21] <sintax> finders keepers
[23:23:29] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> The cargo is likely owned by whatever insurance company payed out the policy
[23:23:47] <vinrock> if they dont recover it tho after x period of time, it can be sondiered abandoned

[23:25:28] <sintax> gonna have to be quick then?
[23:26:58] <kerat58> yeah in all seriousness, there are some pretty complex maritime "salvage" laws
[23:27:00] <kerat58> on how this all works
[23:27:41] <kerat58> that's why they say if you ever find some gold treasure while diving, tell no one, and melt it down, then sell the gold.  Don't say you found treasure and end up with a dispute with say Spain because you just found their coin from 1468
[23:27:53] <vinrock> loose lips sink ships
[23:27:54] <vinrock> kek
[23:28:03] <vinrock> seriously tho dont ever report anything you find
[23:28:22] <vinrock> in england they will straight up just take it from you and toss you a could sheckels for your time
[23:28:23] <sintax> ^^
[23:28:27] <vinrock> couple
[23:28:40] <kerat58> yeah it can be a real raw deal sometimes
[23:28:46] <vinrock> there the amiecan family that foud the gold eagles in the grandfathers safety deposit box that the feds confiscated
[23:28:51] <int0x1C8> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYuMN206Jzo great show about diving
[23:29:09] <sintax> vinrock: probably made them pay taxes on it too
[23:29:15] <kerat58> governments are all about confiscation; it is just that some confiscation looks more blatant than others

[23:32:29] <vinrock> he got blamed for it
[23:32:35] <vinrock> he just repoted the bag iirc
[23:33:02] <kerat58> lol, a security guard who loved cops all his life reports the bomb, they don't take him seriously, then later they go back and try to say he staged the bomb, and even tried to trick him into confessing on a fake video
[23:33:19] <vinrock> and then he died before anyone had his back

[23:46:39] <Cl0udNinja> `fullbyte` is defined as `bytes.fromhex("00")` (or FF)
[23:46:52] <shakygator> im out of my element
[23:47:28] <Cl0udNinja> I mean I'm basically just appending \xFF until the size is correct, which is about 16MB
[23:47:46] <Cl0udNinja> and then I append that string to an array at the end, for later writing

[23:53:31] <Cl0udNinja> wow.... well TIL
[23:53:53] <estranger> FF bytes are heavier than 00 bytes
[23:54:03] <estranger> puts more weight on the bus, slowing things down
