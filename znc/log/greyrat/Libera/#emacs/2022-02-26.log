[00:02:16] <sturm_> Hi, I'm trying to use Emacs with python-mode's interpreter integration. I can C-c C-e to eval something like "1 + 1" and the REPL shows "2", but eval-ing a string, list, None, function etc. displays no output at the REPL, just adds ">>> ". Any ideas?
[00:02:44] <sturm_> The only customization I've done is set "python-shell-interpreter" to "python3"

[00:36:24] <fsbot> Highly likely!
[00:36:29] <quippy> WTF?
[00:36:41] <bremner> does your custom-file overwrite itself maybe?
[00:36:44] <quippy> is there something wrong with this? (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/.emacs-custom.el")
[00:36:56] <bremner> looks ok?
[00:36:58] <quippy> it shouldn't? it's an Org file that tangles out
[00:37:08] <quippy> one sec
[00:37:11] <quippy> I'm looking at the org file
[00:37:14] <quippy> maybe there's a discrepancy
[00:37:25] <quippy> oh! I bet I figured it out actually, I bet that's exactly the issue
[00:38:17] <quippy> oh that's very frustrating, okay, the problem is that I changed the tangle destination for all code blocks in the entire file instead of having the definition defined under a header, so that I could move the bullets in that header to the top level
[00:38:32] <quippy> and there's one code block specifically that's supposed to go to init.el and the rest goes to another file
[00:39:11] <quippy> and I guess if you tell Org to tangle a more-specific code block, in that code block header, to a different destination than the rest of the file, it just doesn't work? but only if the more-specific code block is the same language as the rest of the tangle definition?
[00:39:19] <quippy> because I _also_ tangle out a bunch of Bash and that's all working
[00:39:26] <quippy> sorry for the long description maybe you care and maybe you don't
[00:39:30] <quippy> but that's definitely it
[00:40:01] <quippy> thanks for the help, whether you care about the long-winded explanation

[03:32:51] <spikemaster> techically you could create an emacs in vim. Tpope made a lisp that compiles to vimscript. With real macros and everything.
[03:33:12] <quippy> every day we stray further from the light
[03:34:12] <spikemaster> but vim's scripting language isn't getting any love, while emacs lisp just gained recent performance gains in the langauge, and on top of that the nativeComp feature.

[06:32:21] <edrx> hi all... I am trying to learn more about the menu bar to add to eev a function that shows the innards of how menu bars work, but there are some things that seem to basic that I can't find how to do...
[06:34:12] <edrx> If I type C-h k and then I click on Edit -> Paste I get the same effect as running this:
[06:34:23] <edrx> (describe-key [(menu-bar) edit paste])
[06:35:15] <edrx> and I can examine all the menu entries starting with Edit by running these sexps:
[06:35:22] <edrx> (describe-keymap menu-bar-edit-menu)
[06:35:22] <edrx> or (find-ekeymapdescr menu-bar-edit-menu)
[06:36:19] <edrx> So (menu-bar) sort of works like a fake prefix key.

[06:37:13] <edrx> How to I list the (fake) key sequences that start with (menu-bar)?

So far I've found the :with-tags and similar options, but tags set with #+TAGS: ... in the org files are not shown later on, and they interact "strangely" with publishing.
[17:32:19] <kenran> That is, when I set :exclude-tags to '("programming"), and `C-c C-e P a` in one of the files, not all files are exported to HTML (as I'd expect, as some of them have this tag in their #+TAGS: ...), but I cannot see any connection between which files are exported and which aren't.  Any pointers on this? I've seen at least one org blog that has something like this, but that one's source is not public.

[17:41:23] <bpalmer> lemacs_zzz: indentation is handled by each mode separately, so the specifics of it may vary; but typically, the way programming language modes do is set indent-line-function to be an appropriate function that will indent the line "properly". You may need to write  your own function that uses the underlying mode's indentation function, and if you don't move, try tabbing

[19:39:52] <kenran> lemacs_zzz: I was surprised by how little it took to get a personal configuration that I'm as happy with as "before" (I have been a (n)vim user that switched to Doom Emacs).  Doom polishes lots of stuff though that I don't, but don't /really/ need.

[22:08:10] <blacked> I do javascript,golang..... alot of programming and recently switched to vanilla emacs
[22:08:22] <blacked> But I cant get indent correct.
[22:08:36] <blacked> Is there any one package to rule them all to indent all things intelligently.
[22:08:41] <blacked> in emacs.
[22:09:08] <technomancy> no
[22:09:28] <corwin> fsbot: tell blacked about enter
[22:09:29] <fsbot> blacked: Enter is not punctuation. Please do not split your messages across multiple lines, as it inhibits readability.
[22:09:47] <blacked> ok
[22:10:25] <blacked> technomancy like treesitter, i would just enable for languages, and it all enables parser based syntax highlighting. Like that

[22:10:32] <technomancy> how could you have one package that knows every language? there's thousands of languages out there.
[22:10:50] <Common-Lisp> huh?
[22:11:16] <blacked> technomancy right, so as tree-sitter, is there any package, that have preconfigured, if not i would have manually add programming langauge i want to indent, just turn on .
[22:11:52] <technomancy> I dunno; all the language modes I use already know how to indent correctly without any additional stuff

[22:22:36] <blacked> ahhhh yeah daleÂ  that what i was lookingfor.
[22:24:29] <blacked> oh dale had you tried tree-sitter?
[22:24:30] <blacked> I dont know how they indent things, they tell it override emacs default programming major mode to their own, i dont know what facilities they added for indentation except syntax highlighting.
[22:24:30] <blacked> OR if Is it possible to enable even if emacs some programming langauge major mode is overwritten by another program, but i still want one feature of that overwritten mode ?
