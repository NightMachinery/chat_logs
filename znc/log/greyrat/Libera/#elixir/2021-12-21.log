[02:29:22] <devin> hello, I have a question about elixir function pattern matching. I'm on Elixir 1.12.3 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 22). If I define two functions of the same name in a module, each with a unique atom as the only parameter, then everything gets compiled and works as expected bc pattern matching can ensure the right same-name same-arity function is called based on the parameter, which is a unique atom. However, if I add a default second parameter to one of the 
[02:29:22] <devin> functions, I get: (CompileError) iex:15: def bar/1 conflicts with defaults from bar/2. I would expect the unique atom in each function to avoid any conflicts in the signatures between these two functions, so I'm wondering if I'm missing something wrt how elixir handles defaults in parameters.

[02:53:32] <benwilson512> devin: the short version is that you need to define a bodiless clause above the other two in order to disambiguate. The longer answer is that you have to mentally expand how defaults work
[02:54:28] <benwilson512> suppose you start with this
[02:54:29] <benwilson512> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/roF75WPT/
[02:54:37] <benwilson512> if you add a default parameter to one of them eg
[02:55:04] <benwilson512> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/yns3fd8T/
[02:55:16] <benwilson512> you get an error. The reason is more obvious if you expand out how the default works
[02:56:36] <benwilson512> what I have there ^^ is equivalent to
[02:56:38] <benwilson512> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Thcr01Xz/
[02:56:57] <benwilson512> as you see, the `def greeting` on line `1` ends up always catching all cases
[02:57:31] <benwilson512> the solution is to use a bodiless clause to disambiguate
[02:57:32] <benwilson512> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Q8CJg8yR/
[02:57:33] <devin> yep that makes sense! 
[02:58:19] <devin> thanks for the explanation
[03:00:33] <benwilson512> no problem!

[10:13:18] <serafeim> hello friendsa
[10:14:30] <serafeim> is anybody here using the `with` thingie ? i'm writing elixir heavily for some time now and i haven't had any situation where it would be useful
[10:14:35] <serafeim> or less complex
[10:14:52] <Nicd> I do
[10:15:13] <serafeim> hm
[10:15:31] <serafeim> can you display an example where the with is useful in a practical situation ?
[10:15:36] <serafeim> do you use it somewhere in codestats ?
[10:15:46] *** Quits: yauhsien (~yauhsien@61-231-38-209.dynamic-ip.hinet.net) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[10:15:50] <Nicd> yep
[10:16:04] <Nicd> though that codebase is not really an example of good practice
[10:16:08] <serafeim> ha ha
[10:16:28] <serafeim> well most prod code isn't an example of good practice because usually there are other priorities
[10:17:01] <Nicd> here's one: https://gitlab.com/code-stats/code-stats/-/blob/master/lib/code_stats_web/controllers/auth_controller.ex#L28

[10:19:40] <serafeim> yes ok i understand. it's a way to run sequential code in an expression

[10:20:15] <Nicd> here's a new long long boi: https://gitlab.com/Nicd/geo-therminator/-/blob/trunk/lib/geo_therminator_web/live/main/pump.ex#L10
[10:20:33] <serafeim> in this line https://gitlab.com/code-stats/code-stats/-/blob/master/lib/code_stats_web/controllers/pulse_controller.ex#L75 there's a `reason` variable
[10:20:52] <serafeim> where does this variable get its value ?
[10:21:29] <Nicd> if any of the matches in the `with` part above doesn't match and instead returns a suitable tuple
[10:21:33] <Nicd> it's a pattern match

[10:24:46] <serafeim> so these 4 functions here: https://gitlab.com/code-stats/code-stats/-/blob/master/lib/code_stats_web/controllers/pulse_controller.ex#L54-L57 do return `{:error, :generic, reason}` ? 
[10:25:16] <Nicd> possibly
[10:25:26] <serafeim> so that means that you haven't used builtins but you have written special functions to encapsulate the builtins and return the proper tuple for the match
[10:26:14] <Nicd> there is no builtin for those things
[10:26:18] <serafeim> ha ha ha ok
[10:26:41] <serafeim> the thing is that you need to write your functions in a particular way in order to be used with `with`
[10:27:05] <serafeim> i can't decide if that's better than just writing a bunch of ifs one inside the other
[10:27:19] <Nicd> I can, it's heaps better
[10:27:26] <serafeim> ha ha ha
[10:27:58] <Nicd> not only does it make sense in general to have a sensible API for your functions, but you can avoid the unreadable `if` pyramid that would result otherwise
[10:28:21] <serafeim> maybe you're right. i'll consider using the with in future situations if i have a similar situation
[10:28:37] <serafeim> Nicd: yes i know. you can't use if more than 2 levels deep or you'll be doomed
[10:28:52] <Nicd> it's always a balancing act and you'll only know how to use it if you learn how to use it
[10:31:32] <serafeim> yes thanks for giving me some examples

[11:17:15] <serafeim> how can i know if i'm running tests in a phoenix project ?
[11:17:25] <serafeim> i want to setup something in my application.ex but only if tests are run
[11:19:31] <serafeim> i'm trying this `System.get_env("MIX_ENV") |> IO.inspect` but i'm getting `nil` when running `mix test`
[11:20:11] <serafeim> ah
[11:20:15] <serafeim> that's the correct one `Mix.env() |> IO.inspect`
[11:20:23] <Nicd> note that Mix isn't available in releases
[11:21:32] <serafeim> so this will break in release ?
[11:21:43] <Nicd> yes, it will crash
[11:21:51] <serafeim> how to write it properly ?
[11:22:04] <serafeim> put it in a try catch ?
[11:22:22] <Nicd> I don't know what people usually do for modifying their app for test
[11:22:45] <Nicd> but you can config it: `config :my_app, testing: config_env() == :test`
[11:23:10] <serafeim> you mean in my config/test.ex
[11:23:28] <Nicd> in your config.exs or runtime.exs
[11:23:33] <serafeim> cool thanks
[11:24:03] <Nicd> I mean if you like to use that test.exs then you can set it to `false` in config.exs and `true` in test.exs
[11:24:11] <Nicd> I only have config.exs and runtime.exs
[11:31:30] <serafeim> really ? not dev.exs ? 
[11:32:05] <Nicd> nope
[11:34:06] <serafeim> strange
[11:34:10] <serafeim> phoenix creates these by defautl
[11:35:03] <Nicd> Phoenix can't rely on runtime.exs existence I think
[11:35:11] <Nicd> and different strokes for different folks
[11:35:38] <Nicd> I have this: https://gitlab.com/code-stats/code-stats/-/tree/master/config

[11:38:21] <Nicd> and in the runtime.exs I have env specific sections
[11:39:23] <serafeim> i'm using the default phoenix thingie. the only extra is that i'm adding this code in the end to load extra stuff (that won't be versioned) https://dpaste.org/AZwY
[11:39:27] <serafeim> version controlled
[11:40:12] <Nicd> I have local overrides in `.env`
[11:40:57] <Nicd> like https://gitlab.com/code-stats/code-stats/-/blob/master/.env.dist
[11:41:52] <serafeim> i avoid usingg the env unless absolutely necessary

[11:56:25] <Nicd> maybe not if you might use it in the future. but you should remove Ecto code from your codebase

[13:02:35] <josevalim> i will also submit it to the forum once it makes the rounds in the mailing list
[13:05:12] <serafeim> so let will then be used as a reducer ? seems useful for people that don't want to use reducers
[13:05:23] <serafeim> so *for* will be used as a reduder
[13:05:57] <serafeim> does it have any advantage over just using a reducer ?
[13:06:15] <serafeim> i guess the sytax will easier to understand for multiple comprehensions
[13:11:18] <Nicd> my concern was about the reduce option but I saw it will be deprecated
[13:11:50] <serafeim> for has a reduce option ? 
[13:11:52] <serafeim> lol

[13:13:29] <Nicd> for does quite many things currently
[13:14:16] <serafeim> i didn't know about that so when i had to reduce multiple things i had to use reducer in a reducer resulting in beautiful things like this: https://dpaste.org/o8sb
[13:14:27] <serafeim> i remember that sometimes i had used 3 reducers one inside the other

[16:37:17] <Zarathu> josevalim: i submitted the issue for that. i want to try to fix it today and get a PR over (as well as for the other issue from sept) but master appears completely broken

[16:37:39] <josevalim> Zarathu: i need more context :)
[16:37:40] <Zarathu> well, not *completely*. phx-click doesn't push any events
[16:37:53] <Zarathu> sorry, wasn't expecting you to be here :>
[16:38:08] <Zarathu> i'm trying to figure out if it's really an issue in master or if it's on my end
[16:39:10] <Zarathu> `data-phx-link="patch"` works, as do a bunch of other events. but in my app when i use PLV master, `phx-click` links and buttons don't work anywhere
[16:39:27] <Zarathu> (and by "don't work", i mean nothing happens. no console errors or anything)

[16:44:54] <josevalim> Zarathu: double check if it is not a node.js cache
[16:45:12] <josevalim> like, you are not using the javascript that comes from master, but from whatever version you were before
[16:46:44] <serafeim> well the conclusion is that it will definitely be useful to avoid reducer mess :)

[17:26:35] <Zarathu> removing all occurrences of phx-click-away in my app caused everything to work again
[17:27:41] <Zarathu> i don't understand this commit, like why it's desirable to not execute both
[17:52:02] <Zarathu> sorry :< i was hoping to take things off of everyone's plate but instead i'm adding a new issue

[21:25:55] <Ankhers> Does anyone have experience with cockroachdb and ecto? I'm just trying to play around with it and I'm getting an error when trying to migrate for the first time. It seems it doesn't like the lock table commend on the schema_migrations table.
[21:36:11] <whk> looking at the for guide makes me realise that I should be using for much more frequently... actually going to see if I can use for to refactor some ugly code and try and avoid using it as a hammer now. 
[21:58:06] <Ankhers> whk: In my experience, for is not really used all that often outside of Phoenix views. Not saying it shouldn't be used more, but people generally prefer the Enum module.
[22:05:19] <whk> we have 2 or 3 places where it seem to be cleaning a bunch of complexity, but yeah.. does not seem like the goto for simpler cases.

[23:28:21] <OliverMT> Ankhers: there is a  cockroach db ecto fork specifically for the migrations
[23:28:31] <OliverMT> there is some kind of lock the ecto migrations tries to set that is not supported in cockroach db
[23:28:37] <OliverMT> so you need the ecto_cockroachdb
