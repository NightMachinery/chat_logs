[21:17:25] <basshelal[m]> headius: I'm a little annoyed that JNR-FFI doesn't support structs by value, especially as parameters, I discussed this with enebo while you were on vacation.
[21:17:25] <basshelal[m]> How easy do you think it  would be to add this at some point, I had a bit of a go myself but started to lose the plot and got busy with other work.
[22:38:37] <edipofederle[m]> Hi Guys, we plan to make some similar improvements (ref: https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/pull/2259/) on JRuby side ?
