[00:53:11] <hkm> not sure what that means

[01:09:50] <khronosschoty> hi I was wondering, how exactly is someone supposed to set the HOME variable for running git-daemon via inetd?
[01:10:06] <khronosschoty> "Giving these options is an error when used with --inetd; use the facility of inet daemon to achieve the same before spawning git daemon if needed."
[01:10:12] <khronosschoty> https://git-scm.com/docs/git-daemon
[01:11:51] <khronosschoty> I've tried to solve this using several methods, such as write a shell script to call git-daemon instead of calling git-daemon directly in the inetd.conf
[01:12:51] <khronosschoty> the only method I've come up with that works is setting HOME and then calling the inetd but that effects all the programs being run via inetd and not really a solution

[01:19:40] <hkm> khronosschoty, if you set a variable as such `a=2 COMMAND` and execute the given command on the SAME line, the variable will only be modified for that line
[01:20:32] <hkm> oh no i misread your problem, sorry
[01:24:00] <khronosschoty> I saw an old Debian bug report about this, but there didn't appear to be a solution, it seemed like they just dropped inetd for git-daemon use. I didn't confirm this is the case, tho. All I know is, I can't seem to solve this issue following the available documentation.

[14:02:44] <mrtnt_> I'm writing a script in Python which uses a GitPython library. The script pulls a repo with "Git(repo_dir).pull()". However, this repo can be empty and thus the "Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref 'refs/heads/master' from the remote, but no such ref was fetched.'" error is shown. As a workaround, I first check if the remote repo is empty or not with "Repo(repo_dir).git.ls_remote()" and pull the
[14:02:46] <mrtnt_> repo only if it isn't empty. Is the "git ls-remote" correct or best way to check if the remote repo is empty? Perhaps there is a more elegant solution?

[20:53:40] <ramblebamble> Howdy guys, I have a question regarding `git checkout --orphan`. It creates a new commit without any anscestors, similar to `git init && touch a && git commit -a -m 'foobar'` so there are 2 trees. How will GIT's very own garbage collection behave in this case because non of those trees are reachable from the other

[21:11:21] <ramblebamble> yes, a lot of commands in the man-pages do not have a NOTES section but put everything of that kind in the description, and everything below that is for examples or switch-description, so scrolling all the way to the bottom is not my first instinct, unfortunately
[21:11:28] <mackerman> Garbage collection of unreachable objects would be a short summary. The implementation details are deferred until the options are explained of how to get things done.
