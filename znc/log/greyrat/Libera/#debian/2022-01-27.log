[00:33:19] <Protected> Hey there. Just tried to upgrade a server from buster to bullseye using the instructions in the release notes and while the upgrade itself seemed to go well, without any of the possible issues listed in that page, after reboot the server doesn't seem to be booting. I mounted the filesystem from a recovery image and can't immediately find anything logged in /var/log from after the moment of
[00:33:19] <Protected> the reboot. Where can I look for information that might help me figure out what's going wrong?

[00:51:58] <Khepra> there isn't, from "inside" the OS. unless you modified initramfs to send of the kernel buffer somwehere. if that's a server, perhaps you have OoB access, ipmi or something, and can use serial output (virtual or real) to read the console

[01:05:35] <anddam> howdy, semi-OT question (not really sure there), I have a Debian 9 and an Ubuntu 18 running as guest vm on libvirt. The virt domain is configured to automatically redirect USB on both, when I connect a CCID device on host (a smart card reader) the Ubuntu machine sees the device (I check this via lsusb) the Debian system does not
[01:05:57] <Khepra> Protected: oh yeh, if you have KVM access (keyboard-video-mouse), then that's another way to look up the console during boot
[01:05:59] <anddam> could this be due to somehow udev missing some feature on Debian 9?
[01:06:34] <Khepra> anddam: well what does dmesg say?
[01:06:56] <Khepra> it's possible ubuntu has the driver (patches). ubuntu does a lot of hardware enablement patching of their kernel, something debian doesn't have
[01:07:02] <Protected> Khepra: Finally got a view of the boot output after some java shenanigans. So, something about unrecognized mount option "default"... [FAILED] ... to mount /home, [DEPEND] Dependency failed for Local File Systems is all that's logged. Can I fix this from here or should I reboot back to recovery and edit fstab?

[01:07:57] <Khepra> unfortunately you can't rewrite moutnign options via cmdline, you'll have to change fstab. probably missing "nofail" from the mount options, roughly assuminng from what you just said

[01:09:22] <anddam> Khepra: the (patched) driver for what?
[01:09:40] <Khepra> anddam: ubuntu must have more than just that, did it recognize the device and load up the correct module? or is it just xhci_hcd that's involved in this?
[01:09:44] <anddam> I mean I am trying to see the device on lsusb here, I figure that's up to the virtualizator to provide that, then it's plain USB
[01:09:47] <Khepra> anddam: your usb device
[01:09:54] <Protected> That was the case before the upgrade, and I double checked sshd_config earlier just to make sure it wasn't something silly like a return to default config :)
[01:10:20] <Khepra> anddam: smart card readers have traditionally been badly supported on linux.
[01:10:31] <anddam> Khepra: mm good question, I am not too knowledgeable on how USB work. I'll pastebin the dmesg related part

[01:12:19] <anddam> these are the output of `sudo dmesg | grep -i usb` on ubuntu  https://termbin.com/6fpy  and  debian  https://termbin.com/pcvq
[01:14:17] <anddam> ubuntu has ehci ohci uhci and xhci, debian only the latter
[01:14:35] <anddam> that's a lot of hci more, IIRC those just differ for USB version support, right?
[01:14:37] <Khepra> anddam: perhaps you're constraining yourself to just "usb" grep. you should really tail -n 0 -f  /var/log/kern.log or even better, use journalctl -n0 -f   and then plug the device and pastebin what pops up at that moment
[01:15:13] <Khepra> anddam: I think this is not about USB at all but specific card reader thatn then  cascades to various USB drvers. Debian's kernel has all the USB core drivers like ubuntu,
[01:15:28] <anddam> ok
[01:15:45] <anddam> also I'll leave just one guest VM at time while doing this
[01:15:59] <anddam> I am not sure the thing can be redirected both ways at once

[16:18:54] <merpaderp> I did the usual for swapping buster to bullseye in /etc/apt/sources.list file, then update && upgrade && dist-upgrade
[16:19:07] <merpaderp> after reboot it seems half the packages are missing from system
[16:19:45] <PerfDave> OK, I'd go back and start with the upgrade guide for Bullseye, from the start, go step by step.

[16:34:30] <Khepra> and did you disable third party repos before upgrade? not sure what should've been done with frankedebianized packages tho. uninstall or what
[16:35:26] <merpaderp> I think I did not, well I did now at least
[16:36:02] <merpaderp> well now the situation is that apt is working fine, but most of packages are not installed anymore, like gcc is gone, just installed xorg again
[16:36:58] <Khepra> if you need build tools, you could install the build-essential metapackage and it'll pull in everything else
[16:37:30] <merpaderp> yea well it was just an example
[16:37:42] <merpaderp> seems whatever I did wrong during upgrade, lost all the packages I had on system
[16:38:12] <merpaderp> so I might as well start puting everything in place, starting with X11 with intel graphics and so forth
[16:38:19] <merpaderp> like, firefox-esr is not installed anymore
[16:38:36] <jelly> it would be a lot easier to figure out what happened if you could show apt output
[16:38:41] <PerfDave> merpaderp: I'd check the output from the original broken upgrade and see what happened.
[16:39:31] <jelly> these things can happen if the admin pushes on blindly without look at what apt is saying

[20:09:28] <vezult> I have a server for which outgoing http requests are negotiated by proxy
[20:09:42] <vezult> curl works, apt doesn't
[20:09:43] *** Seto_Kaiba is now known as Hunterkll
[20:09:47] <vezult> https://paste.debian.net/1228610/
[20:09:53] <vezult> both are configured to use the same proxy
[20:10:09] <vezult> is there something obvious that I'm missing?
[20:10:44] <Poster> apt is running in sudo, does the root user have http_proxy defined?
[20:11:19] <jelly> vezult, do you have access to proxy logs?
[20:11:25] <vezult> Poster: it's defined in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/apt_proxy.conf
[20:11:36] <vezult> jelly: no, I don't have any control over the proxy
[20:11:42] <jelly> hmm.
[20:12:24] <jelly> vezult, can you look at the output of "apt --print-uris update" and try to fetch some of those manually
[20:12:34] *** Quits: Hunterkll (~hunterkll@2001:470:8b06:100:2958:1194:aedf:1fa3) (Quit: Leaving)
[20:12:35] <vezult> Poster: Acquire::http::Proxy "http://10.141.22.15:8080/";
[20:12:39] <Poster> jelly's idea is good, you could also try running tcpdump locally to see if it's trying, assuming your LAN adapter is eth0 it would be "sudo tcpdump -n -i eth0 host 10.141.22.15 and port 8080" ; in another window run your apt command(s) and see if tcpdump shows traffic
[20:12:58] <vezult> Poster: I can't install any packages...so, tcpdump is out of the question
[20:13:02] <vezult> it's not currently installed
[20:13:32] <rawtaz> i accidentally set a password using `passwd` on the root user of a bullseye system. can someone verify that the most exact way to get things back to what they were on that root account by default is to run `passwd -l` rather than `passwd -d` ?
[20:14:12] <vezult> jelly: I can fetch those manually w/curl
[20:14:19] <vezult> or, all the ones I've tried
[20:14:20] <Poster> ok try: "watch -n1 netstat -an | grep 10.141.22.15"
[20:14:22] <jelly> interesting
[20:14:42] <jelly> vezult, does your proxy inspect User-Agent?
[20:14:57] <rawtaz> actually, if im right the most exact way would be to do `passwd -dl root`
[20:15:08] <Poster> sorry, make that: watch -n1 "netstat -an | grep 10.141.22.15"
[20:15:19] <jelly> rawtaz, or just keep a root password set.  It's safer to have it than not to have it.
[20:15:44] <Poster> the refresh rate of 1 second may be too slow to see the traffic
[20:15:45] <jelly> there are situations where having a known root password helps and is better than not having any set.
[20:15:50] <rawtaz> jelly: how can a root account with a password that can be used be safer than a root account that is locked (a ! in the password field in the shadow file)?
[20:16:09] <vezult> Poster: I see new connections made
[20:16:10] <rawtaz> right. i do have sudo users currently, using sudo to go root when needed
[20:16:20] <rawtaz> jelly: i take it you mean safer in terms of plan B :)
[20:16:23] <vezult> that was with apt
[20:16:37] <jelly> rawtaz, system breaks and boots into a rescue mode which asks you for root password
[20:16:48] <vezult> also w/curl
[20:16:50] <rawtaz> yeah, gotcha
[20:16:56] <vezult> I mean, I assume it's from them.
[20:18:05] <Poster> Well that's sort of good, looking at your paste apt is getting a 403.  Does your proxy require a username and password?
[20:18:25] <vezult> well, it doesn't w/curl :-)

[21:14:54] <jelly> Heston, I'm aware of that.  Tell them so.
[21:14:58] <karlpinc> fling: It could also have to do with jami being gnome.  Maybe it wants a whole-lotta gnome-y stuff, including stuff that's normally installed as "recomends" and so is not installed because your box does not have X.
[21:15:38] <karlpinc> fling: In other words maybe they've not separated out the X client from the X server requirements properly.  Just a random guess.

Use wnpp-alert (from the <devscripts> package) to see what packages you are using that are in need of help.
[22:14:18] <karlpinc> fling: Or maybe you contact the jami package maintainer and ask that they do a new package from the source.  It sorta depends on the build process whether that would be better than the <wnpp> route.
[22:14:47] <fling> karlpinc: talking to them
[22:15:01] <karlpinc> fling: See also the <ssb> factoid, but that assumes that the package you want is in sid, which is probably not the case.

[23:38:49] <useretail> sney, or should i better upgrade my dist?
[23:39:16] <amacater_> useretail: Much better idea to upgrade to bullseye and 5.10 out the box, in my opinion
[23:39:41] <sney> useretail: there is a newer debian stable release than buster, but if you're trying to solve 1 problem, you might want to try the backport kernel first to see if it even makes a difference
[23:39:49] <sney> tbh that message sounds like a hardware problem, like a funny hub
[23:40:15] <sney> shtrb: for a game that old, if proton doesn't easily support it, you could always run a windows xp (or previous version) VM and play it that way. wine may also be an option
[23:40:42] <shtrb> sney, yep VM with winxp it is :) (cleaner than wine)
