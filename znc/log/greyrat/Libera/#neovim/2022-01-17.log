[02:09:20] <aelen> hey all! I've been pimping out my neovim config recently after being a long time vim user and just using the same plugins for ages. Now I'm rocking things like treesitter which remove the need for many of the other plugins I have and I'm trying to remove the remaining functionality over to LSP, but for some reason I am struggling to get formatting work properly. I am trying to get formatting for terraform 
[02:09:26] <aelen> working, for example, which ultimately just runs `terraform fmt`, but it's not working. How can I start to debug this?
[02:09:50] *** Quits: kron (~weechat@user/qaph) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:09:55] <aelen> fyi, `:LspInfo` shows me that the `efm-langserver` is attached, but I am not sure if it's actually running or anything
[02:10:26] <mjlbach[m]> Assuming you configured efm correctly?
[02:11:48] <aelen> not entirely sure - I do have eslint working through efm for example, so it shows errors/warnings and stuff
[02:11:51] *** Joins: kron (~weechat@user/qaph)
[02:13:37] <aelen> but I can appreciate that linting and formatting are quite different

[12:55:55] <kylo252[m]> clason: could you take a look again at https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/17059
[12:55:55] <kylo252[m]> sorry about the confusion there
[12:56:19] <kylo252[m]> you probably need to edit the issue description a bit
[12:56:20] <clason[m]> I don't see how `@` enters this issue at all?
[12:56:39] <kylo252[m]> his username has an `@` but he forgot to mention it 😅
[12:57:00] <clason[m]> Hmph.
[12:57:02] <kylo252[m]> language barrier most likely
[12:57:50] <kylo252[m]> you can skim through the lunarvim issue for more context if you'd like, but the main problem is that stdpath can contain `@` for some godforsaken reason
[12:58:36] <kylo252[m]> it's an upstream issue as well btw
[12:59:09] <kylo252[m]> it's probably gonna be proper headache for Uri/Path/LSP generally at some point
[13:01:08] <clason[m]> Good thing we don't accept URIs for spellfiles.
[13:02:20] <kylo252[m]> I think that LSP has generally worked fine for him, but this makes me worried about whatever function that makes this fail for spellfile
[13:03:12] <clason[m]> whatever Bram implemented in `spellfile.c`
[13:03:51] <clason[m]> which you can just look at.
[13:04:04] <kylo252[m]> would it be be spell_load_file from the  get-go? that one is just calling `os_fopen` immediately, which is a bad sign if it doesn't work..

[14:16:56] <dngray[m]> i suppose the flatpak might be okay for just some very basic plugins
[14:17:23] <dngray[m]> though there does seem to be a npm wrapper included with it
[14:18:14] <Amanda[m]> That sounds like something that would cause more problems than it would solve
[14:18:22] <Amanda[m]> * That wrapper sounds like
[14:18:51] <dngray[m]> only reason i was thinking about it is because i thought it might be nice not to overlay it
[14:19:16] <dngray[m]> i might just confine it in a container, mostly for organization anyway.
[14:23:36] <dngray[m]> <Amanda[m]> "That sounds like something..." <- yeah maybe
[14:24:23] <dngray[m]> i kinda thought as it looked official https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.neovim.nvim
[14:24:23] <dngray[m]> https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim#flatpak
[14:24:44] <dngray[m]> derp maybe i need to add that to my path hehe
[14:25:49] <dngray[m]> wait nevermind, i don't think that will help
[14:25:52] <Amanda[m]> I'm just very cautious with attempts to package node, since most of them are a bit terrible
[14:26:14] <dngray[m]> i don't think it packages nodejs
[14:26:38] <Amanda[m]> Oh I misunderstood completely then
[14:26:41] <dngray[m]> and i installed the `nodejs` and `yarnpkg` from fedora repos so I assumed it would be okay
[14:27:06] <Amanda[m]> I thought you were talking about a flatpak for node
[14:27:35] <dngray[m]> it was more about being able to access them inside of neovim's flatpak, for things like https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim and https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim
[14:27:42] <dngray[m]> Amanda[m]: oh lol, god no

[14:47:11] <clason[m]> unfortunately, that is not a drop-in replacement for LaTeX (depending on what you use it for)
[14:47:30] <clason[m]> there's also texlive-scheme-minimal, I believe
[14:48:59] <leiserfg[m]> clason[m]: what does not work for you with it?
[14:49:36] <clason[m]> Lots of packages that I need for journal styles
[14:49:53] <clason[m]> And I need to use the same compiler as arXiv, otherwise it's just a pain.
[14:50:39] <clason[m]> And it needs a completely different build system, so that collaboration with other people that do not use it becomes a mess.
[14:51:01] <clason[m]> (It's a good project, don't get me wrong; it's just not "one size fits all".)

[15:05:38] <clason[m]> Yeah, VimTeX is the bee's knees :)
[15:10:31] <dngray[m]> well what i think ill do is use the neovim flatpak as like a cut down neovim for just general editing

[16:05:58] <Amanda[m]> sounds like a bug in nvim-cmp then?
[16:07:11] <Amanda[m]> and i just checked, somehow my local nvim-cmp had an incompatible history with upstream, so something was amiss

[16:09:07] <cbus> hmm, so I added this https://github.com/p00f/alabaster_dark.nvim plugin but it doesnt show in :Colors (fzf colorpicker) but does show up in :colorscheme, any ideas?

[21:02:20] <kylo252[m]> a quick and dirty text replacement for  the file in `arkav/lualine-lsp-progress`, didn't really work out 😅
[21:05:13] <kylo252[m]> nvm, seems that the error is unrelated, so yeah just having it on path and adding it by file name `"lsp_progress"` works for me

[22:17:49] <Charles[m]> doesn't show either, maybe i'm calling echo wrong

[22:23:45] <Charles[m]> it's kind of weird that it doesn't use the value of `filetype`
[22:23:59] <clason[m]> Because it's more general
[22:24:12] <clason[m]> You can fire the event on certain directories etc.

[23:29:21] <zenof> in my colorscheme (derived from the Melange theme) when I do hlsearch, the background of the character at the cursor position is the same as the normal background which makes the highlighted word look strange. I think that's inverted fg and bg. how can I make it it still uses the usual cursor colors, I think that's the  "Conceal" keyword?
