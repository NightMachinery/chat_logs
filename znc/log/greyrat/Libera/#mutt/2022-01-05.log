[21:22:48] <bmomjian> I am running Mutt 2.0.5 on Debian 11. I am running mutt -e 'set index_format="  %S ..."', but am having trouble with the 'New/N" display not showing when the email has Status and X-Status email headers.  Basically, if it has both headers, when I try to mark a read  email as New with 'N', it does not show as new, but as still blank/read.  However, if I don't set index_format, it shows 'N' properly.  Is %S not the default display for Mutt?  
[21:22:48] <bmomjian> If not, what is the default display format?  If I use index_format %Z, I see the N, but also other flags I don't want to see.
[21:35:03] <bmomjian> I now see the default is %Z, which shows the three flag levels.  What I think is happening is that %S has to put all three flags into one character, and I think the later X-Status blank is overwriting the New flag, which seems backwards.  Earlier versions of Mutt did not do this, but the new Mutt version that came with Debian 11 is causing this.
[21:35:32] *** Joins: barbarossa93 (~barbaross@c-73-39-107-44.hsd1.md.comcast.net)
[21:36:35] <bmomjian> What is really odd is that when I use my custom index_format, New is actually working because tab stops at the New email and skips the read ones, but there is no indication in the display that it is new.  This makes the user interface kind of confusing too.
[21:48:35] <bmomjian> I solved it by changing %S to %2.2Z so I only get the first two %Z status values --- seems to work.
[21:49:19] *** Joins: spare (~ovrldjoww@user/spareproject)
[21:51:43] <bmomjian> Oops, that is not going to work since the tag mark is the third letter.  :-(
[21:53:58] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: AFAICT the %S expansion code hasn't been changed, in 24 years.
[21:54:40] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: you're welcome to open a ticket detailing the change in behavior and I'll try to track a regression down though
[21:55:23] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: 'N' has always been the 'default' value displayed if no other status flags are set...
[21:56:12] <bmomjian> OK, thanks. I ended up using %Z and setting to_char to '', which seems to work fine.  My wife uses mutt so the TF... would have totally confused her since it confused me too.  I might introduce it later now that I see it can have value.
[21:56:20] <bmomjian> But at this time, I think simple is better.
[21:57:21] <bmomjian> Well, N is no longer the default --- it is showing blank for read and read message marked as unread emails if the X-Status header exists.
[21:57:44] <bmomjian> Which I am pretty sure is a change since I only upgrade last week and have been using mutt for years.

[22:01:07] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: if you can include a sample mailbox and muttrc that shows the problem that would be appreciated
[22:02:06] <bmomjian> OK, sounds good. Yes, it was a dash.
[22:02:38] <bmomjian> Ah, it might be that the 'r' is overriding the N.
[22:04:10] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: but you say you are trying to mark it as 'new' and it's not changing the flag. so that could be a bug.
[22:05:23] <bmomjian> So it is changing the internal status, as I can see via using the tab key, but there is no change in the %S display.
[22:07:47] <bmomjian> i am now seeing this clearer.  If the email displays with 'r' via %S, the N/mark-as-new doesn't change the %S display.  It is possible this is an old problem and I am just finding it.

[22:10:00] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: if you refresh or pagedown/up again does it redraw properly?
[22:12:13] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: wait, you are saying 'r', not '-'.  'r' indiciates a replied status
[22:12:14] <bmomjian> No.
[22:12:26] <bmomjian> Right, 'r', not '-'
[22:12:58] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: yes, the reply status has always overridden display of 'N'.
[22:13:05] <bmomjian> I tried changing pages but that status stays as 'r', not 'N'.
[22:13:17] <bmomjian> Oh, OK.  Is there a logic for that?
[22:13:35] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: yeah, that would be expected behavior.  'N' is the default if no other flags are displayed.
[22:13:41] <bmomjian> Oh.

[22:15:00] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: I can't explain the "logic" behind it, but the behavior hasn't changed :-/
[22:15:16] <bmomjian> There is no control over that reply flag, right?  Now  my %Z display is mostly N and O, but some 'r', which seems kind of odd.
[22:15:25] <bmomjian> Yeah, I must have just hit this issue after the upgrade.

[22:15:44] <bmomjian> Oddly I got two emails that were 'r' that I needed to mark as unread, which got me digging.  ;-)
[22:15:51] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: no %S expando has no configuration
[22:16:38] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: you may want to look into index-format-hook though
[22:17:00] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/#index-format-hook
[22:17:02] <bmomjian> I saw that.  :-)
[22:17:33] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: it *might* give you something you like if patterns match the behavior you want to display
[22:18:19] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: I don't think all the display flags have a corresponding pattern operator, but it's worth a look.
[22:19:11] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: I need to run right now though
[22:19:26] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: feel free to report updates or questsions to the channel though.
[22:31:34] <bmomjian> Thank you for the help here.  I obviously didn't have a full understanding of the issue until now.  I will dig and report back.
[22:39:17] <bmomjian> I am a good digger.  ;-)

[22:42:58] <bmomjian> OK, here is an issue.  When I use %S, N doesn't overwrite 'r', but when I use %Z, N overwrites 'r'.  This is not  a case of %Z having more columns because 'r' and 'N' are both in the first column of %Z and %S.

[23:42:42] <bmomjian> I looked at index-format-hook, and while I can generate the first letter I want, I need the last two characters of %Z, and I don't see any way to get only the last two characters, skipping the first character.
