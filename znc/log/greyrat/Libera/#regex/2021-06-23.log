[15:57:53] <purplex> for room, i'd make the bot auto-kick for > 10 lines to handle it..  
[15:59:02] <digitok> meh
[16:00:23] <Me-me> purplex: I only say "don't spam" because digitok wants to be more cautious with the bans.
[16:00:38] <purplex> anyway spam is too vague now, even me-me can't tell what's spam anymore
[16:00:38] <Me-me> Otherwise I would simply kickban them
[16:00:56] <digitok> most of the "spammers" don't even know what irc is
[16:01:03] <digitok> so no, they shouldn't be kickbanned
[16:01:39] <purplex> not saying banned, just they'd learn not to do second time perhaps?
[16:02:04] <digitok> they generally do after you say "don't"
[16:02:19] <purplex> like a gentle reminder 'kick'
[16:02:44] <digitok> even more gentle
[16:02:49] <digitok> loving, almost
[16:03:06] <Timvde> At least this channel doesn't have a lot of Matrix users who post long messages and then edit their message, which duplicates it
[16:03:34] <digitok> that's dumb
[16:03:53] <purplex> guess i'll drop this spam discussion since it's too vague for me to tell whats spam anymore
[16:04:09] <Timvde> digitok: well, it's basically the only way to replicate the edit on IRC
[16:04:12] <digitok> Me-me calls it spam, but it's not spam
[16:04:21] <digitok> Timvde, yes, don't replicate it
[16:04:25] <digitok> it's irc
[16:04:33] <Timvde> Then you don't get the edited message
[16:04:36] <digitok> good
[16:04:37] <Me-me> It is spam because it's flooding, and it's definitely flooding.
[16:04:54] <Timvde> It would be cool if it could generate a sed replace :P
[16:05:35] <digitok> it's nothing unless it's intentional
[16:06:08] <purplex> if user says it wasn't intentional guess we should believe it
[16:06:51] <digitok> they're on a site which they don't even know can save a link, they click "live help", they think "i need so show them my data"
[16:06:53] <digitok> that's all
[16:07:03] <digitok> to*
[16:07:36] <digitok> 99% of them won't do it again after you say "don't"
[16:09:10] <Me-me> https://libera.chat/guides/bots#ozone There's also this.
[16:09:42] <Me-me> Might be able to (instead of kline) simply quiet people who paste like, four lines in under a second so that they don't paste another fourty on top of that. And maybe give them a warning.
[16:09:54] <Me-me> So we don't have a "the damage is done" problem.
[16:10:34] <digitok> i don't think you can paste much in under a second, this network seems to delay it
[16:10:50] <Me-me> Fair. Four lines in four seconds then.
[16:10:51] <digitok> the paste above spanned 8 seconds
[16:11:23] <digitok> Hash can type more than that
[16:11:35] <Me-me> I fail to see the problem.

[17:12:00] <Me-me> I don't accept that. Kicking out, sure. But we should have no obligation to purposefully let people flood the channel just because "they don't know any better". That's my line in the sand. I don't let people punch me in the face just because it's a friendly greeting in their culture.
[17:12:29] <Me-me> At some point, the obligation is on them to understand what it means to paste lines into a channel. They can suffer through a 30 second timeout.

[17:47:05] <purplex> What a nice lion, pasted data in the link and didn't spam us.
[17:47:17] <Me-me> Indeed.
[17:47:33] <Me-me> Lion: What seems to be the problem? The substitution?
[17:47:35] <re101-lion-76> Hello, I would like to test a replace regex.
[17:47:51] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/N0P0ZM/2 PCRE2 no longer supports \N, now you have to use $N
[17:48:21] <re101-lion-76> I want to use \1 to call back my group
[17:48:29] <re101-lion-76> but not seem to work
[17:48:40] <Me-me> Check the link I posted.
[17:48:53] <re101-lion-76> Ok seems to be $1 to be used
[17:48:56] <re101-lion-76> instead
[17:49:13] <Me-me> Yes.
[17:49:59] <re101-lion-76> Thanks a lot ;-)  Your web site is very usefull. Big thanks
[17:50:37] <purplex> Let me say it this time.
[17:50:40] <purplex> Happy to help.

[19:30:32] <jimbocz> I am counting columns in a line from a csv file
[19:31:46] <jimbocz> Link is https://regex101.com/r/P5cpHK/1/
[19:33:08] <jimbocz> It's important that not every column in the csv will be quote escaped even though the example is
[19:33:53] <jimbocz> And I know very little about regex, sorry
[19:45:06] <OnlineCop> jimbocz: https://regex101.com/r/P5cpHK/2 perhaps? Depends on whether your regex flavor supports look-behinds.
[19:45:33] <OnlineCop> If I recall, CSV accepts "escaped" double quotes as: "" (two sequential double quotes).
[19:46:06] <OnlineCop> As in: "Column 1"|"Column ""2"""||Column4
[19:47:52] <OnlineCop> jimbocz: https://regex101.com/r/P5cpHK/3 if your regex engine doesn't like the look-behind.
[19:50:22] <OnlineCop> And if I remember correctly, SOME csv formats allow a literal newline within a quoted column, so that `[^"]+` should still match it when "|Column[newline]2||" is read.
