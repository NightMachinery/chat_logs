[04:01:00] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Presently looking at trying to get nimlsp to work with kate apparently the present issue is with a `didChange`
[04:01:17] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Ah life is better with a controller 😛
[04:01:27] <PMunch> Oh most definitely
[04:01:34] <PMunch> I've actually been able to get some progress now :P
[04:02:06] <PMunch> If you want to help out with NimLSP I believe one thing that would really help debug stuff is a record/playback feature
[04:02:15] <FromDiscord> <Alea> how do you compile with the options set in your project's nimble file?
[04:02:22] <FromDiscord> <Alea> like binDir and such
[04:02:24] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Well right now i just want diagnostics
[04:02:34] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `nimble build`
[04:02:36] <PMunch> Essentially a way for nimlsp to store each command that goes through in a format that can then be replayed by a test
[04:03:25] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3Ttr could i bother you for a moment  to explain why the json doesnt match the `requestMessage` herre?
[04:03:46] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Is it the lack of `id`?
[04:06:47] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> In reply to @Elegantbeef "There's also a protobuf": planning to use that actually
[04:06:49] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> I love protobuf
[04:11:45] <FromDiscord> <luteva> In reply to @Alea "how do you compile": i think you can just use nimble as a command instead of nim
[04:13:06] <FromDiscord> <luteva> params are added fromn the nimble config and c (compile) r (run) etc. are just "forwarded" to the nim command
[04:17:45] <FromDiscord> <Alea> Hmm, now its throwing an error that it can't find my installed nimble packages despite the nimble dir being in my path
[04:19:40] <PMunch> @Elegantbeef, me?
[04:20:10] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Yea disregard i just changed the code a bit and it then accepted it even though it's not adhering to the spec
[04:20:21] <PMunch> All the message definitions are taken from the LSP spec
[04:20:33] <PMunch> But some clients are dum-dums and don't adhere to the spec
[04:20:43] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Yea i got that
[04:20:46] <PMunch> The way NimLSP currently works requires the use of strict parsing
[04:20:55] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Pmunch quit typing
[04:21:18] <PMunch> Otherwise the initial parsing will succeed when it's meant to fail and fall through to the next message type
[04:21:32] <PMunch> What change did you make to make it work?
[04:21:48] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I understand, and making it accept that message just got further to making it crash with badly formed cancel request
[04:22:03] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I changed id to be optional to see what would happen, but it just got to a cancel request and cried
[04:22:14] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Kate's LSP implementation seems to disregard the spec quite hard
[04:23:08] <FromDiscord> <luteva> In reply to @Alea "Hmm, now its throwing": can you list your installed packages?
[04:23:12] <FromDiscord> <luteva> which OS?
[04:23:41] <FromDiscord> <luteva> nimble list -i
[04:23:56] <FromDiscord> <Alea> Windows 10 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/371759389889003532/957064824318222407/unknown.png
[04:24:08] <PMunch> Yeah the way you distinguish a request from a notification is by the existence of an ID IIRC
[04:24:51] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So then perhaps it's a you issue. hmm i dont know much need to look at the spec more
[04:25:46] <PMunch> Sounds like a Kate issue TBH
[04:26:21] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I mean it's probably not even the issue
[04:26:29] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> We're not getting any request for diagnostics it seems
[04:27:25] <PMunch> Wait, didChange isn't a request
[04:27:27] <PMunch> It's a notification
[04:27:30] <PMunch> So that's correct
[04:27:36] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Yea it is
[04:27:37] <PMunch> diagnostics are sent on save
[04:27:40] <FromDiscord> <luteva> ok so maybe your are just not in the folder of the project you want to compile/run? if all went well, you should be able to just use the nimble command instead of nim (for compiling, running, debugging, cross-compiling etc.). But I have absolutely no idea about how that works on windows.
[04:28:59] <FromDiscord> <Alea> I think I originally installed nim without choosenim, so I'm thinking of nuking my installation and starting over clean with the new version↵that a good idea?
[04:30:07] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Hmm seems kate isnt sending a save lsp message
[04:30:09] <PMunch> If you have a broken Nim installation then sure
[04:30:17] <PMunch> @Elegantbeef, well that's silly of it
[04:31:57] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Yea the only instance of the word (s \| S)ave is in the intialize request
[04:32:43] <PMunch> The problem is that asking nimsuggest for diagonstics is kinda slow..
[04:32:52] <PMunch> That's why it's only done on save
[04:33:03] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I mean i know that
[04:33:06] <PMunch> I guess a "if has been able for x seconds" test could be added as well
[04:33:11] <FromDiscord> <luteva> In reply to @Alea "I think I originally": as pmunch said: If you have a broken Nim installation then sure.↵I think many windows guys try it with a new/clean installation whenever "something is wrong". but i do not know.
[04:33:38] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's a case of even with saves there is no diagnostic information being exchanged so something somewhere isnt happy
[04:34:40] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> But go back to elden ring i'll toy around
[04:35:13] <PMunch> No worries, I die so frequently that I'm typing while it reloads :P
[04:35:19] <PMunch> I've been playing the whole time
[04:35:38] <PMunch> But do you get the save notification in NimLSP?
[04:35:45] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> No
[04:35:55] <PMunch> Without it it won't send diagnostics, no matter if the file is saved
[04:36:28] <PMunch> So you either need to get Kate to send save notifications, or you need to implement something in NimLSP that sends diagnostics without it
[04:51:03] <PMunch> Well, that's enough gaming for tonight

[15:49:42] <FromDiscord> <Bung> The packed pragma can be applied to any object type. It ensures that the fields of an object are packed back-to-back in memory.↵what does this mean ? "packed back-to-back in memory"
[15:51:03] <PMunch> It means that if you have a char, a char, and an int it will take 10 bytes on a x64 machine and not 16 bytes it would usually take with alignment
[15:58:38] <FromDiscord> <Bung> sorry ,not 6 bytes right ?
[15:59:12] <FromDiscord> <Bung> where 16 bytes  coming from
[15:59:16] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> !eval echo sizeof(int)
[15:59:18] <NimBot> 8
[16:01:35] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> Padding can be added to 2/4/8 bytes types in object type so that they are placed in multiple of 2/4/8 address.
[16:02:10] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> !eval echo sizeof ('a', 'b', 1'i64)
[16:02:13] <NimBot> 16
[16:06:38] <FromDiscord> <Bung> why there are padding
[16:07:04] <FromDiscord> <Rika> It is more efficient for the processor
[16:07:12] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Processors read words
[16:07:21] <FromDiscord> <Rika> So a 64 bit processor reads 64 bits at a time
[16:07:48] <FromDiscord> <Rika> It would be annoying to use two reads for an integer because there were two bytes used before it
[16:12:04] <supakeen> You get a free short!
[16:14:40] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> !eval echo sizeof (1'i64, 'a', 'b')
[16:14:43] <NimBot> 16
[16:14:48] <supakeen> Honestly, a lot of this is also just based on previous simpler processor designs and simplifications.
[16:16:17] <supakeen> For example I know that Intel unaligned reads are basically free unless they cross a cache line.
[16:16:20] <FromDiscord> <Bung> I think I need a example to understand how the type padding added and how the processors read
[16:16:57] <supakeen> You're not dealing with padding here, Bung.
[16:17:15] <supakeen> You're dealing with a fixed-width type, an i64 or a 64-bit integer, which is always 64-bits and thus 8 bytes.
[16:17:20] <FromDiscord> <auxym> out of curiosity... what's the failure mode of ARC in the presence of cycles? Does it simply fail to collect refs that are part of the cycle? Or will it attempt to collect stuff that's in use and segfault? Or cause an infinite loop / infinite copies / set my computer on fire?
[16:17:24] <supakeen> If you have two of them you always have 16 bytes.
[16:18:18] <supakeen> Now if you have structs it's normal for those to be padded to a multiple of the largest type.
[16:19:21] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> echo sizeof (1'i64, 2'i8, 3'i64, 4'i8), ", ", sizeof (1'i64, 3'i64, 4'i8, 2'i8)↵Most of case, padding are added so that 4 byte types are placed on multiple of 4 address and so 8 byte types.
[16:19:25] <supakeen> But again this is both compiler and architecture dependent if it needs to be done, and is not usually something one worries about.
[16:19:29] <supakeen> Unless you do really bad things.
[16:19:30] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> !eval echo sizeof (1'i64, 2'i8, 3'i64, 4'i8), ", ", sizeof (1'i64, 3'i64, 4'i8, 2'i8)
[16:19:33] <NimBot> 32, 24
[16:21:02] <supakeen> Reminds me of the old C best practice of reverse-sorting your structs by size for the least amound of waste 🙂 
[16:21:55] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @auxym "out of curiosity... what's": Cycles do not get collected; if you make more you hit memory limits
[16:22:18] <FromDiscord> <Rika> If the program ends there will be memory that isn’t freed
[16:22:41] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3TvQ
[16:22:58] <FromDiscord> <Rika> No crashing or freezing yes
[16:23:10] <FromDiscord> <auxym> right. so if I have cycles involving objects that have a lifetime equal to the lifetime of the program it shouldn't cause an issue
[16:23:37] <FromDiscord> <Rika> It would if your operating system is dumb and not freeing memory on end
[16:23:50] <FromDiscord> <Rika> So don’t try it on embedded I guess?
[16:24:47] <FromDiscord> <auxym> well, on embedded (bare metal micros), lifetime of the program = time that the system is powered on. everything is "freed" on a reset /  power down 😉
[16:25:48] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Well sometimes it’s important to free on end anyway
[16:25:51] <FromDiscord> <auxym> thanks for the info on arc btw 👍
[16:26:09] <FromDiscord> <Rika> ORC could still work on embedded
[16:26:18] <FromDiscord> <Rika> You just lose determinism
[16:26:24] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Might be important for you
[16:26:25] <FromDiscord> <auxym> the cycle collector is run time overhead though, no?
[16:26:26] <FromDiscord> <auxym> yeah
[16:27:24] <FromDiscord> <auxym> i'm toying around with writing a scheduler fyi, which is a global that is always alive (obviously, sort of like an OS), but avoiding cycles is sorta hard
[16:27:51] <FromDiscord> <auxym> might have to resort to manual MM for some of the low level details
[16:31:59] <FromDiscord> <mratsim> In reply to @auxym "the cycle collector is": Only for types that may have cycles, and the collection is still inserted at deterministic location, it's the duration of collection that is non-deterministic<

[16:32:38] <FromDiscord> <auxym> In reply to @mratsim "Only for types that": interesting, ty. so can I see where's it's inserted with expandArc?

[16:33:33] <FromDiscord> <Bung> (edit) "28" => "2  8" | "1" => "1 "
[16:34:16] <FromDiscord> <mratsim> In reply to @auxym "i'm toying around with": where would you have cycles in a scheduler? Your tasks are a direct acyclic graphs
[16:34:58] <FromDiscord> <mratsim> actually a tree
[16:35:13] <FromDiscord> <mratsim> only one parent can spawn a task.
[16:35:47] <FromDiscord> <auxym> scheduler has a ref to tasks, but tasks have a ref to the scheduler so that they can make "syscalls" (yield, acquire lock, etc)

[19:34:09] <FromDiscord> <Phil> I mean, you can pretty much use whatever you want.

[20:07:52] <FromDiscord> <Phil> How you set filepaths and the like, whether absolute compared to one or all relative, is just a detail on how to use that.
[20:08:41] <FromDiscord> <Phil> If the only variable thing in your application is filepath though and you don't need settings, then your original approach of just compiling them all relative to a specific folder is also valid. I just haven't encountered a lot of scenarios where that was the case yet, so I instinctively go for the runtime-settings-approach
[20:09:50] <FromDiscord> <Patitotective> i still need to see how i'm going to "build" an application↵like, appimage, snap or just a binary
[20:10:11] <FromDiscord> <Patitotective> and see if runtime settings work in that case
[20:10:30] <FromDiscord> <Phil> IIRC flatpak was winning the popularity contest, could also be a valid target
[20:11:01] <FromDiscord> <Phil> Well, popularity contest compared to the alternatives of snaps and appimages
[20:12:03] <FromDiscord> <Patitotective> yea, gonna check it too and maybe put all those alternatives in the template so you can choose which one to use or choose all

[21:58:21] <PMunch> @Alea, haven't seen it personally since I don't use Windows. But that looks like a string interpolation issue
[22:12:14] <FromDiscord> <Alea> it's probably another error caused by having a space in my username :withered:

[22:12:55] <PMunch> @Patitotective, define "open"
[22:13:07] <FromDiscord> <Patitotective> open in the browser
[22:13:23] <FromDiscord> <Patitotective> just like discord
[22:14:18] <PMunch> Platform specific for sure
[22:14:41] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> https://nim-lang.org/docs/browsers.html ?
[22:14:42] <PMunch> On Linux you could probably do `xdg-open "https://duckduckgo.com"`
[22:14:54] <PMunch> Oh, or that apparently :P
[22:15:03] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> in the std library thankfully
[22:15:13] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> also PMunch did you have a chance to look at my PR?
[22:15:15] <FromDiscord> <Patitotective> In reply to @ajusa "https://nim-lang.org/docs/browsers.html ?": 🙃  thanks
[22:15:40] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> or a chance to update the docker/readme instructions?
[22:15:54] <PMunch> For the playground? No I haven't had a chance to look at it
[22:17:09] <FromDiscord> <Alea> is there any way to force the choosenim subcommands to run in verbose mode?
[22:17:22] <FromDiscord> <Alea> maybe I'll see what string formatting fails exactly
[22:28:02] <FromDiscord> <Alea> Judging by the message printed right before the error, it builds the compiler and then makes an early return from the build function before building the tools which is where I would presume this error happens since it mentions nimble.exe ↵https://github.com/dom96/choosenim/blob/950d19e7f5bfe96e95a90781633a4d28029d6f59/src/choosenimpkg/builder.nim#L133
[22:33:29] <FromDiscord> <Alea> Ok I think the error might be coming from here? https://github.com/dom96/choosenim/blob/b959c84745ff4869d6d7ef0818b7147685b3f494/src/choosenimpkg/switcher.nim#L222
[22:33:46] <FromDiscord> <Alea> How could this formatting break?
[22:48:50] <FromDiscord> <Alea> Annoying 😮‍💨  ↵guess I'll have to go with manual install again
[22:54:14] <PMunch> Is this just a normal Windows build?
[22:54:55] <FromDiscord> <Alea> yeah
[22:55:16] <FromDiscord> <Alea> I'm 90% sure it's an error with formatting the filepath because of the space in my username
[22:55:27] <FromDiscord> <Alea> that same error has popped up several times across the nim tools
[22:58:07] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> Are you trying to build devel Nim with choosenim? What's error message did you got?
[22:58:18] <PMunch> Yeah spaces are annoying when writing terminal applications
[22:59:31] <FromDiscord> <Alea> It got the step where it says `Compiler: Already Built` and then failed with https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/371759389889003532/957345568903012402/unknown.png
[22:59:53] <FromDiscord> <Alea> It also printed something about running nimble.exe -v
[22:59:57] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> You need to quote paths with '' or "" if it contains space.
[23:05:35] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> How did you run choosenim?
[23:06:36] <FromDiscord> <Alea> through the runme script, both regular and as admin
[23:07:34] <PMunch> I don't think it's where you thought it was @Alea
[23:07:50] <PMunch> The error message seems like $1 is passed to exec or something like that
[23:08:15] <FromDiscord> <Alea> possible, jumping around on github was tough
[23:08:43] <PMunch> Have you done `--verbose` on the choosenim call?
[23:09:40] <FromDiscord> <Alea> yup, that just printed out a bunch of messages about the disabled analytics
[23:09:50] <FromDiscord> <Alea> nothing about the actual subscripts
[23:10:34] <PMunch> @ajusa, the build error is because I've forgotten to change Dockerfile_nopackages to reflect the _v1 change in Dockerfile
[23:13:01] <PMunch> You can either apply those changes, or you can just build v1.4.8 instead :P
[23:14:50] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> wdym by v1.4.8? do I put that in the one file?
[23:15:26] <PMunch> `echo "v1.4.8" > curtag`
[23:15:31] <PMunch> Then run the Docker command
[23:21:11] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> gotcha, I will try that then with the nopackages file and see if I can get it working locally
[23:22:20] *** Gustavo6046\away is now known as Gustavo6046
[23:27:06] <PMunch> I was able to build that one at least

[23:34:55] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> hm, tried that and I have the images building but the command to get the versions doesn't seem to work. Additionally, some of the other commands ran by this program require root and certain users?
[23:36:04] <PMunch> Not quite sure what you mean?
[23:36:28] <PMunch> It is a bit hard-coded to the playground production environment I believe
[23:36:33] <PMunch> But I have run it locally in the past
[23:43:52] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> In reply to @Require Support "so i have a": If you are just trying to use functions/procedures in .dll file: https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#foreign-function-interface-dynlib-pragma-for-import
