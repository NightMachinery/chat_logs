[13:14:13] <ERROH> Renderwww, is https://store.steampowered.com/app/1612480/Heal_Hitler/ verbotten in your country?
[13:38:18] <Renderwww> naturally
[13:38:26] <Renderwww> it only shows "Oops, sorry!"
[13:38:41] <Oxyd> Literal fascism.
[13:39:01] <T`aZ> negative fascism, so its ok
[13:39:53] <Renderwww> not sure if actually verboten or steam just not bothering
[13:40:03] <T`aZ> need to make sure it doesn't underflow, or you'll get Undefined Fascism, and there anything can happen
[13:40:38] <Renderwww> I'm still amused by the irony that games like Wolfenstein are literally verboten because of swastikas even though the whole point of the game is shooting nazis in the face
[13:43:09] <Renderwww> I wonder if heal hitler is akshually blocked from activation in deutschbagland
[13:43:36] <Renderwww> for many of the porn games you can still activate keys
[13:58:35] <ERROH> porn is verbotten too?
[14:14:51] <Renderwww> it would require some kind of age verification that goes beyond ticking "yes I'm older than 18 and want to view smut"
[14:15:06] <Renderwww> valve didn't want to bother with that so they just don't show any porn games in the german store
[14:18:01] <T`aZ> that shit is expanding into other part of eu
[14:18:18] <Renderwww> but think about the children!!!
[14:18:54] <Renderwww> end game is clearly some chinese local EU internet
[14:19:03] <Renderwww> *chinese style
[14:21:43] <Oxyd> If it filters out all the Americans, I'm all for it.
[14:22:01] <Renderwww> that's racist!
[14:33:53] <Renderwww> https://cryptowat.ch/de/charts/KRAKEN:BTC-USD?period=30m maybe I get to buy a new giraffics card too
[14:35:01] <Oxyd> Of course crypto would crash just after I buy a GPU.
[14:35:24] <Oxyd> Also, I have absolutely no clue how to read most of that.
[14:35:25] <Renderwww> you should buy some more
[14:35:57] <Renderwww> only the one on the left is important where the squigly line is red and goes down
[14:37:03] <Carbonflux> thats the kind of screen they show in movies.
[14:37:22] <Carbonflux> smart people look at them
[14:38:04] <ERROH> i'm surprised coins aren't verboten

[14:44:21] <Oxyd> Weimar-era coins probably are.

[14:58:54] <MaNI> doubt GPU prices have crashed as well though
[14:59:01] <MaNI> so no need to regret your GPU purchase yet
[15:00:40] <Carbonflux> its interesting to consider the challenge of making a graphics device that can't be used for mining, assuming there is any interest in that.
[15:01:30] <Carbonflux> frankly i think the console industry it loving this.
[15:02:13] <MaNI> nvidia put out some half hearted attempts, they were immediatelly cracked
[15:02:22] <Carbonflux> i think a lot of the management types like to keep proclaiming, even in private, that the PC era is over.
[15:03:27] <Carbonflux> in the end i think the powers that be want to move back to a "mainframe" model.
[15:03:47] <Carbonflux> rendering is remote, using farms.
[15:04:03] <T`aZ> just need to wait 20 more years so local computer (aka pc) are hype again
[15:04:15] <Carbonflux> i am waiting for the first versions of meta-VR cloud implementations.
[15:04:16] <dukwon> home cloud
[15:04:25] <Carbonflux> yup
[15:05:04] <dukwon> bird cloud
[15:07:44] <Carbonflux> needs another disruptive tech thingie, maybe the solution is to make computing cores so cheap it does not matter, using carbon, nanotubes and 2D materials i suspect. Given the heat problems go away we can make 3D computing blocks without needing rare earth. These blocks will also enable ray tracing to become a valid real-time option.
[15:09:38] * Carbonflux handwaves and intones that sacred "make it so..."
[15:09:58] <MaNI> pricing was pretty fine before demand outstripped supply, we just need to wait for the next giant economic bust or for manufacturing to recover/ramp up and it will be back to normal
[15:10:16] <Carbonflux> ya
[15:11:12] <Carbonflux> still, i think carbon based computing is going to be a nice change, moving away from rare earths is important imo.
