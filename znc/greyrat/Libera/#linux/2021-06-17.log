[03:00:31] <Guest80> Well.. it’s here lol
[03:00:43] <Kyv> As stated in the ArchWiki, the everything should be set automatically and the xorg.conf will be used to 'tune the driver'.
[03:00:57] <BCMM> perhaps it's more like a crash course in how the system actually works, rather than a user thing, and the questions is more like "how does the init usually get launched"
[03:01:12] <BCMM> as opposed to "how should the user make init launch"

[03:01:34] <Guest80> Thanks all you’ve been very helpful
[03:01:34] <Kyv> helpppppppp: if it is not working automatically then it is the kernel modesetting you should address.
[03:01:43] <autopsy> The kernel launches init through initramfs.
[03:01:46] *** Joins: quarkyalice (~quarkyali@user/quarkyalice)
[03:02:17] <autopsy> The kernel actually launches /init then inside the initramfs then the initramfs hands over the init processd to the root fs.

[04:40:48] <phogg> 90% of it is just a wrapper around a series of kernel features, and there are other wrappers
[04:41:19] <c705> phogg: the arguments I was hearing was setuid = bad and lots of cves. I'll give them that cves are bad against it because of the setuid, but I read the developers side of the argument and i'm not entirely convinced either way
[04:41:21] <phogg> if all you want is to have a private network namespace it's not the greatest choice, and the same can be said for each of the things it does

[07:07:08] <timj> theproffesor: getting X11 window coords is notoriously hard because different window managers have different amounts of decoration. a good guess is to pick the coords of the grand child (app window) of the root window, minus the coords of its parent window (wm deco). except for window managers that implement virtual desktops via an intermediate root window - this can be detected with WM specific hints on the virtual root, which is a child
[07:07:08] <timj>  of the X11 root.
[07:07:09] <timj> also, the above approach doesn't work for toolkits that draw their own deco (gtk these days), that again has to be detected with toolkit specific xprops on the app windows.

[09:40:42] <kurahaupo> The modes by which data recovery can occur change depending on the generation of technology. SSD cells have an intrinsically binary state, so once a block is gone it's really gone, but SSD devices operate by keeping a mapping from the total block pool to the apparent device size, and so you can't be certain whether the inaccessible blocks contain traces

[10:05:09] <autopsy> Constant compiling means you never get a binary.

[10:05:32] <kodah> Comrade: you want builds to be dependable and repeatable, which is why we create binaries and strive to make them multi-platform when possible

[12:06:17] <kirk781> gnux, FEdora is bleedy edge and based on RHEL. Ubuntu is more stable and based on Debian
[12:06:43] <kirk781> gnux, Most beginners tend towards Ubuntu though both are equally noob friendly. Ubuntu is slightly easier IMO
[12:07:01] <gnux> ah
[12:07:02] <gnux> ok
[12:07:10] <gnux> fedora 34 now

[12:07:24] <gnux> 34 >> rhel 8
[12:07:27] <kirk781> Aherin, like which?
[12:07:30] <Aherin> ive been on Debian since.. well since before humans discovered fire
[12:07:57] <kirk781> Aherin, there was a time when I knew dozens of folks on Linux and ALL used Ubuntu. I could recognize that Unity desktop from anywhere
[12:08:02] <Aherin> kirk781 i had issues with network commands which where different, not sure how that is these days :)
[12:08:19] <kirk781> Ubuntu is just Debian with updated repos :p

[12:09:02] <maret> SysGhost well yeah thats the issue I am trying to solve
[12:09:10] <Psi-Jack> kirk781: Not really. Mint IS basically Ubuntu.
[12:09:13] <kirk781> Heck, with Elementary OS and Mint, one could go about without ever opening the terminal
[12:09:18] <Aherin> i want a distro that has the looks of macos/ios, the integration of Apple, yet the freedom and passion of FOSS, and preferably NOT by a Chinese company
[12:09:21] <Psi-Jack> kirk781: With some actual breaking changes.
[12:09:35] <deniska> The most noob friendly linux is arch. Ubuntu is intended for highly trained professionals
[12:09:36] <kirk781> Psi-Jack, well, yes but they project themselves as even more entry level than Ubuntu

[15:19:36] <MrFreeman> Greetings. I was just using Clonezilla (partclone) to clone a drive, I turned my monitor off to get some rest, and when I tried to turn my monitor on, no video connection was re-established. I am guessing that is expected behavior, or should a video signal be detected by my monitor?

[15:21:12] <ysftaha> Hello, I was wondering if there is a way to run a script in the background from within the script i.e. not having to put an "&" (ampersand) after the executable when running it.
[15:22:12] <kurahaupo> ysftaha: why don't you want to use & ?
[15:23:26] <BCMM> ysftaha: as in, you'd like to just run ./script.sh, and have it go the background on its own?
[15:23:29] <ysftaha> well, the script is a simple pomodoro, that sleeps then `notify-sends` I want it to run in the background. More specifically `nohup` but I don't want to `nohup pomo` everytime.
[15:23:41] <ysftaha> BCMM: exactly
[15:25:05] *** Joins: Yorick_ (znc@vps.freegamehosting.eu)
[15:25:16] <kurahaupo> ysftaha: A "background job" is a process group whose leader is a direct child of an interactive shell. Which means it has to be forked directly by the interactive shell, and not waited for. But if you merely want it to run without the shell waiting for it, then just use & inside the script, perhaps on a compound statements that encompasses most of the script

[15:33:39] <sumthing1980> ah ok
[15:33:46] <BCMM> also, simply forwarding all traffic to another machine is not exactly the same thing as an http proxy
[15:34:03] <sumthing1980> so iptables then?
[15:34:05] <BCMM> usually, that would refer to a proxy that applications are aware they are using

[20:06:26] <miko> oops
[20:06:45] <rob`> I personally find Chrome a little sus just on the basis that it has some ungodly percentage of the browser market; even if it's technically more secure, it'll be more targeted by possible exploiters. There's advantages in being in the minority, for security purposes.
[20:06:50] <Psi-Jack> alzgh: You think Chrome itself does the spying? No, it's Google, themselves, that are integrated into many sites, and many transactions of various kinds. The browser itself has extremely little to nothing to do with it.
