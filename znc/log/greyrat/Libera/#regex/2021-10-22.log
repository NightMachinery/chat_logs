[03:09:54] <maroon> i updated a regex digitok helped me with couple days ago, and the change was messing it up. i wanted to have an optional hyphen between capture groups not being captured, and that caused the later group to slide to a different group position. i think i got it back working right, but was wonding if changing -? to -*? is the right way?

[03:50:44] <digitok> it doesn't look like it's doing what you described?
[03:52:39] <maroon> it did when it had -? instead of -*?
[03:54:19] <maroon> though that has the effect of swallowing multiple leading hyphens, but i guess that's not a dealbreaker
[04:00:34] <digitok> doesn't that break match 1
[04:02:34] <maroon> match1 is supposed to have the entire word, so thats fine
[04:03:31] <digitok> but with -? it doesn't get the suffix in group 4
[04:04:17] <maroon> correct, the suffix was supposed to stay as grp4, but -? causes it to float down to being grp3 if the string is like 1234-FF
[04:05:03] <digitok> if there is more than one hyphen, should only the first one be excluded from group 3?
[04:06:36] <maroon> wasnt supposed to, but thats not a dealbreaker, the big problem is that the word ending with -FF should always have that be grp4 instead of being grabbed by something else, like when the word is 1234-FF
[04:08:33] <maroon> looks like (?=-?) is also working for grabbing only 1 hyphen and never stealing from the suffix -FF
[04:10:11] <maroon> in place of -*?
[04:11:28] <digitok> you must be looking at a different link
[04:12:52] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/sRfXLo/5
[04:14:29] <digitok> it sounds like you want groups 3-5 to exclude the - from group 3, no?
[04:14:36] <digitok> matches 3-5*

[17:11:53] <maroon> maybe if the group (-FF|-23|) is changed to something like (-FF\b|-23\b|\b) that would keep the earlier group from stealing the hyphen from it?

[17:19:47] <digitok> cool :)
[17:22:15] <digitok> (?!(?:FF|23) ) is slightly cleaner than (?!FF |23 ), just a few more steps
