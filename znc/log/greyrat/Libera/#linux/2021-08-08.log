[01:24:29] <Kadigan> Hm... Hey guise, I've been looking (on and off) into some sort of solution to stream stuff over the Internet from my own box. Like, a webserver thing that would allow me to go through my media folders, and then let me stream whatever in a browser window - transcoding as required - so that I could watch stuff remotely instead of having to download it. Any ideas? I'd rather not install any sort of app for that, either.
[01:24:41] <Psi-Jack> Kadigan: What's a "guise?"
[01:24:57] <Kadigan> It's "guys" but misspelt. Long story.

[04:16:58] <neshpion> "Prime numbers indicate scenarios in which conflicting options were given.  The following options conflict, in order of their prime number: ...  If an error code is a multiple of two or more prime numbers, the factors indicate mulitple conflicts"

[04:17:29] <bewees> [[R]]: So if the GPU is passthroughed to a VM, the hypervisor GUI is emulated?
[04:17:37] <[[R]]> bewees: what?
[04:17:52] <neshpion> evilop: that's far too straightforward
[04:18:07] <sheep> bewees: the hypervisor doesn't have the ability to use the passed-through GPU. The VM has almost complete control
[04:18:14] <ali__> evilop, there is only one file under xorg.conf.d/ which is xkb-defaults.conf
[04:18:24] <sheep> bewees: so the host might not have a graphical output at all, or it might have to use a different GPU
[04:18:38] <evilop> ali__: as I hinted at, xorg does autoconfiguration these days (and have done so for 20 years no)
[04:19:00] <Psi-Jack> evilop: 20 years? Not quite, but kinda sorta.
[04:19:01] <evilop> ali__: so you only need a config snipplet if you want to override it, eg for setting the keyboard layout
[04:19:07] <evilop> Psi-Jack: I include the HAL days
[04:19:17] <Psi-Jack> Back then it was XFree86./ 🙂
[04:19:29] <sheep> ali__: do you have the virtualbox guest drivers installerd?
[04:19:30] <bewees> sheep: Um, so you would have to shutdown the guest until you can get back any graphical or CLI interface?

There is no man file for this command, and nothing in the mdadm docs that I can find. Does anyone know if this is essential to run? If so, has anyone heard of this problem before, or know what might cause it?

Appears that after I removed all the OTF files with 'font.dir' and 'font.scale' files out of the ~/.local/share/fonts/misc directory, I could install the xorg binary 'xorg-fonts-misc', asking to remove 'xorg-fonts-alias'...plus it auto installed 'xorg-fonts-alias-misc' with 'xorg-fonts-misc'.  Now when I issue the command 'xfd -fn
[11:59:10] <locrian9> -wuncon-siji-medium-r-normal--10-100-75-75-c-80-iso10646-1' it shows the xfd font grid with all the glyphs and their glyph codes.

[15:08:27] <Lope> jim, thanks. my main concern is whether windows can handle being the 5th partition
[15:08:58] <jim> I think yes, but I don't know much about winderz
[15:09:11] <Lope> okay, I've got another question please :)
[15:09:19] <Lope> I've got a GPT linux install with 4 partitions
[15:09:20] <jim> sure
[15:09:27] <jim> ok
[15:09:29] <Lope> On a 60GB SSD. I want to copy it to a 1T SSD
[15:09:40] <Lope> I know I can't just DD the whole thing
[15:09:52] <jim> yeah, I wouldn't use dd
[15:09:55] <Lope> So I was thinking I'd need to manually create the partitions
[15:10:08] <paulcarroty> and?
[15:10:18] <jim> yeah, I think so to
[15:10:18] *** Joins: takimbal (~takimbal@linuxhq/tkimball)
[15:10:21] <jim> o
[15:10:40] <Lope> then I could probably DD the first 3 partitions

[15:10:54] <Lope> something like that?
[15:11:08] <jim> you could use rsync or cp -a
[15:11:12] <Lope> I know then the UUIDs will be the same so that might break my system temporarily while both SSDs are connected to both
[15:11:42] <Lope> probably the best is to format each partition and then cp the contents.
[15:11:44] <Lope> bit of a hassle.
[15:11:50] <jim> well if you create the partitions, they'll each get a different uuid
[15:11:57] <Lope> yes
[15:12:04] <paulcarroty> before dd-ing partitions check their sizes, they should be identical
[15:12:19] <Lope> yeah, for sure
[15:12:28] *** Quits: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[15:12:33] <Lope> but paulcarroty if I do DD. then I'll have multiple partitions with the same UUID
[15:12:44] <Lope> which I don't care about cos the SSDs will be on separate machines
[15:12:55] <Lope> But will that upset my kernel while I'm doing the copying etc?
[15:13:34] <Lope> they'll be on separate machines eventually, but I might connect both SSDs to the same machine to do the dd'ing
[15:13:42] <Lope> unless I somehow dd over ssh?
[15:13:52] <Lope> I guess I can dd via ssh
[15:13:58] <paulcarroty> create new partition -> dd old to new
[15:14:14] <paulcarroty> and you'll get new uuid
[15:14:18] <Lope> like dd if=/dev/sdXn (how do you make dd to stdout?)
[15:14:22] <Lope> then pipe that to SSH
[15:14:43] <Lope> oh, paul that's brilliant.
[15:14:44] <paulcarroty> copying over ssh is very slow
[15:14:53] <Lope> I've got a LAN
[15:15:00] <Lope> and can do SSH aes accelerated, it'll be fast.
[15:15:04] <jim> I think you're thinking about two different ways to use dd... dd the entire drive, or dd each partition separately... and I'm saying maybe you don't need dd at all. dd transfers an image of the drive or partition, but if you use rsync or cp -a (or others are possible), that's not image, it's file-by-file
[15:15:25] *** Quits: sdoubleyou (~sdoubleyo@user/sdoubleyou) (Quit: Leaving)
[15:15:26] <Lope> paulcarroty, I thought the UUID was determined by the filesystem? So you're saying the UUID is determined by the partition table?
[15:15:34] <paulcarroty> even over LAN, you should do deep tuning with enc protocols to speedup scp

[15:15:57] <paulcarroty> sure
[15:16:59] <paulcarroty> dd-ing entire drive makes sense only if drives are identical by size

[17:38:26] <Psi-Jack> Good for userspace stuff, like $HOME
[17:38:43] <n4dir> felco: when debian is in the freeze for the new stable release, even unstable hardly gets new packages. experimental would, you'd assume, but really not that exciting

[17:40:29] <felco> Running Debian here, using backports and non-free, it is pretty solid

[17:43:11] <felco> I use tar to write to tapes, but would be nice to have a backup manager that can work with tapes
[17:43:13] <jsbach> Psi-Jack, i have a docker container which has to be started up with the execution. This docker container variable  is set in my .bashrc like MY_CONTAINER_NAME="remote_de"

[19:36:14] <autopsy> They straight deregistered me on Freenode.
[19:36:24] <Psi-Jack> for help on this network, there's #libera, specifically.
[19:36:30] <Psi-Jack> autopsy: They did everyone.
[19:36:32] <zulu> So I'm using a nick that's registered by someone else though. How is that working?
[19:36:37] <Psi-Jack> And now you can't even login to their network at all, period.
[19:36:53] <autopsy> Oh.
[19:36:57] <Psi-Jack> zulu: Well, they can ghost you at any time.
[19:37:01] <Psi-Jack> Kicking you off.

[19:37:08] <zulu> So if they show up then I'd be booted out?
[19:37:12] <Psi-Jack> Yep.
[19:37:19] <zulu> Ahh, thank you again.
[19:37:21] *** OneLegend is now known as legend
[19:37:23] <autopsy> It disconnects your client from the server and you dissapear from sight if they know the password.
[19:37:24] <angular_mike_> according to this https://www.linuxatemyram.com/ linux always uses all RAM, spare ram is used for disk caching. However htop only shows like 4gb out of 16 being used normall. Does it mean disk caching is not working?
[19:37:41] *** Joins: AmR|EiSa (~amr@156.199.80.130)
[19:37:41] <legend> zulu: you aren't immediately booted out. They would have to first identify to nickserv, and then issue the REGAIN command
[19:37:51] <zulu> Got it.
[19:38:41] <autopsy> angular_mike_, you have to see that in Linux, if programs call malloc the memory is allocated but not considered used yet, your disk caching works fine.
[19:38:42] *** Joins: gambl0re (~gambl0re@24.140.237.124)
[19:38:49] <tirnanog> angular_mike_: nope. it simply means that your workload hasn't yet been sufficiently intensive or running for long enough in order for the amount of anonymously mapped pages (those used by applications) or pagecache (mostly cached disk-backed pages) to grow beyond that.
[19:38:55] <zulu> Okay so another question: apart from Libera.Chat and freenode, are there any other servers that are pretty cool for just browsing through?
[19:39:17] <esselfe> zulu: oftc
[19:39:18] <zulu> (I'm aware of the current freenode politics thing going on, but I know there are still some cool chats happening on there)
[19:39:23] <autopsy> zulu, theres poeple on all IRC networks.
[19:39:35] <esselfe> yeah there are lots of networks
[19:40:10] <zulu> Yes yes, I know, and the other answer is "depends". But I'm just curious what other ones have a lot of activity like these two main ones.
[19:40:25] <angular_mike_> is there a way to show how muc hmemory is being used for disk cache?
[19:40:37] <autopsy> DALNet EFNet. Slashnet.
[19:40:44] <autopsy> Those are IRC networks.
[19:40:44] <zulu> I like browsing random chats, and discovering new ones with neat topics a lot, and figure looking at the more popular networks is a good start.
[19:40:53] <esselfe> angular_mike_: free
[19:41:08] <autopsy> angular_mike_, try man free
[19:41:20] <zulu> Thanks. Because when I logged on at first now there's like 50 of them and I had no clue where to even begin apart from going at it randomly.
[19:41:26] <autopsy> Then open your terminal and free the cat man du!
[19:41:26] <angular_mike_> autopsy: i don't see any mention of disk there
[19:41:29] <tirnanog> angular_mike_: also, htop doesn't account for cache usage by way of its numerical readings.
[19:41:44] <tirnanog> top can.

[21:29:53] <raxor2k> psi-jacl : SMS speak ?
[21:29:54] <sniperwolf> i sometimes stream movies for money on website that has contract with local cinemas, so money goes to local cinema. But buying phiscal releases is kinda useless. I dont even have place for it, and it just distributor getting paid
[21:29:57] <artefact> i am trying to get writeback throttling (wbt) to work. i am still getting huge read starvations during writeback with the wbt defaults. any ideas?
[21:30:03] <Psi-Jack> raxor2k: Yes. See /topic for examples.
[21:30:49] <raxor2k> psi-jack: i dont understand where youre heading to ?
[21:30:51] <Psi-Jack> sniperwolf: Vudu, Netflix, Redbox, iTunes Movies, Amazon, so many many ways to legit pay for and stream.
[21:30:57] <Daemonick> n4dir: can you post me the link?
[21:31:00] <Psi-Jack> You have literally 0 excuses here, sniperwolf, so stop it.
[21:31:21] <n4dir> Daemonick: sure, but a quick google "antix forum" will do it just fine. In case you are faster than i am
[21:31:47] <sniperwolf> but its all big corporations. Pay for netflix so they can continue producing garbage? its probably like with spotify - artists only get pennies of whatever corps get
[21:31:48] <n4dir> back in the days they had an IRC thingy included there, but no more, it seems
[21:31:58] <Daemonick> n4dir: I do not know how to express my problem in simple and short terms

[21:33:20] <ayecee> sniperwolf: if it's garbage, don't use it.
[21:33:30] <n4dir> Daemonick: well, as they include that persistent install for USB for ages now, and they got kind of a gui-configuration-tool and all, i assume you just describe the broad problem, and they will handhold you to solve it. They tend to be friendly and patient and all
[21:33:48] <ayecee> sniperwolf: if it's garbage, and you still want it, it's not garbage.

[21:35:12] <Daemonick> n4dir: thanx

[21:35:16] <sniperwolf> there is not even a way to pay for films and get it in digital form for permanent use

[22:30:42] <THE_GFR|WORK> hey everyone have some weirdness going on.  I am writing data over the network to an image file via ddrescue which you can do to a storage server I have.  ddrescue writes the data and the image file size grows, when ddrescue completes the process, the image file turns into a 300 kilobyte file with a 0 kilobyte log file that is corrupted and does not have the correct info.  Is this related to
[22:30:42] <THE_GFR|WORK> updates, since I am running Linux Mint 20.1 at the moment or permissions on the shared folder?
[22:30:49] <jim> (I don't really like shell languages, they're hard to read, hard to write and hard to maintain... having said that, they're your first contact with the power over your computer afforded by linux)

[22:40:37] <THE_GFR|WORK> ayecee: no I am not, but the other thing is ddrescue has "finished" on the screen but if I try to resume the rescue, it indicates the log file and the image file are the same and can't continue because the log is corrupted

[23:48:36] <neoncortex> Besides all insanity, IRC semms to be the last sane way of communicating, there is no alternatives I'm aware of, sadly.

[23:50:09] <ayecee> that someone would say that sincerely makes me think irc has jumped the shark too
[23:50:24] * Samnzdat slings a few AOL discs.
[23:50:25] <ayecee> back to heart to heart conversations at the fire
[23:50:43] <Samnzdat> Man, those make good coasters.
[23:50:56] <bob_x1> neoncortex: I do agree many projects are moving to alternatives. And no IRC channels for these projects. But in another way - it's easy to check a real free property of the program

[23:54:05] <[[R]]> theres a whatsapp app?

[23:56:58] <tesseract> greatcoof, i think you can use snap or flatpak
[23:57:16] <Psi-Jack> Avoid snap and flatpak.
[23:57:37] <tesseract> Psi-Jack, why?
[23:57:44] <yogoyo> the vote is docker :P
[23:57:48] <greatcoof> also it will be on a pretty small usb so running a bloated distro is not an option
[23:57:53] <Dan39> docker!? DOCKER IS THE DEVIL!
[23:58:05] <Psi-Jack> tesseract: Well, they're both flawed, and do not actually add any benefit whatsoever but more pain.
