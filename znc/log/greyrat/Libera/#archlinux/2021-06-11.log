[00:29:05] <lmat> I just installed postman from AUR after doing a system upgrade (-Syu). When launching postman, I get `electron7: error while loading shared libraries: libicui18n.so.67: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory'. `pacman -Ql | \grep libicuio\.so;` shows  icu /usr/lib/libicuio.so.69.1 (and nothing about 67). Does this mean that the postman package is out of date?

[06:22:13] <charlie5> hi all ... A gcc-ada-debug package has been added to the Archlinux AUR. It is  identical to the official gcc-ada package except that debug symbols have  not been stripped.
[06:22:27] <charlie5> This allows for setting breakpoints on the standard exceptions of  the Ada runtime library in GDB, as opposed to seeing a message such as  'Your Ada runtime appears to be missing debug information".

[08:41:52] <jadelclemens> Howdy, I have an NFS server set up with krb5 authentication. I have an NFS share mounted on a machine with a user that doesn't exist on either the kerberos server or the NFS server, and (I think) as a result of this, any files created by that user are given the 'nobody/nobody' owner. Do I need to create a matching user on one of these servers for user/group ownership to properly propagate here?

[13:56:17] <epic> I am having trouble with systemd-networkd, I have set up eth0.network in /etc/systemd/network with static ip, but networkctl gives me "degraded" for eth0, and some logs ".. eth0: Failed to rename network interface 2 from 'eth0' to 'enp6s0f1': Device or resource busy" . I dont see any conflicting system services and I do not have any udev rules for renaming..

[14:02:39] <epic> yeah it seems something is using the ethernet devices before the renaming happens from networkd - but I dunno why it tries to rename - eth0 is much nicer than enp6s0f1

[14:03:02] <hstefan> Hi! I've been trying to troubleshoot why nothing happens when I click on  the "switch user" button in KDE. I was using XFCE before I had the same issue, so I think there might be something not DE-specific going on. I checked Xorg logs and logs for all systemd units with journalctl, but couldn't spot anything out of hte ordinary. Does anyone have suggestions of where I could look?

[16:29:07] <grawity> but regarding your package

[16:29:22] <grawity> does `pacman -Si ncmpcpp` actually show you the same version as on the website?
[16:29:43] <grawity> (does it happen to show *more than one* package?)
[16:30:06] <Hello_World> No in both cases, it shows the previous build date
[16:30:40] <grawity> what about `pacman -Si boost`, is that at 1.76.0?
[16:30:52] <Hello_World> Yes
[16:31:14] <grawity> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ have you tried switching to a different mirror, in case something broke mid-sync?
[16:31:30] <Hello_World> After a -Syu I ended up with boost at 1.76 and ncmpcpp which couldn't handle it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[21:27:52] <Cybolic> Well... I should mention that some Jack applications don't like pipewire's re-implementation, but since that's optional, it's not really worth complaining about.
[21:28:07] <drop> Just a few days ago pipewire suddenly stopped working correctly with electron/chromium applications for me. It was fixed pretty quickly in Arch, but the experience definitely still isn't perfect.
[21:28:15] <Xogium> hmm I haven't migrated yet, sounds like it would be a rocky start if something goes wrong with the whole thing given I rely on tts
[21:28:53] <Sout> i have managed to screw up pulse / alsa on my work fedora computer, i have an exteral dac/adc, cant seem to use both the mic and the output at the same time any more.

I have an internal soundcard, an external DAC, my HDMI output and the built-in device in the Valve Index and Pulse would occasionally refuse to use one of them or permantly switch to the wrong one. pipewire just uses what I've told it; no fuss :)

[23:14:41] <Betal> wonder why minecraft did not use java 11, as it is a stable release 
[23:14:49] <alschaapman> I guess I could look into how much the PKGBUILD has changed between major releases
[23:14:59] <nihilazo> all minecraft versions up until the most recent one were built against java 8
[23:15:03] <alschaapman> It might be relatively simple to just package it for myself
[23:15:07] <nihilazo> so it's a surprise that it suddenly has jumped to the latest version
[23:15:15] <nihilazo> instead of sticking to a stable
[23:15:33] <Betal> nihilazo: forcing Windows users to update! :)
[23:15:36] <nihilazo> on windows I know that it bundles a JRE
[23:15:49] <nihilazo> so that's probably why they think they can use a new one, because they bundle it
[23:15:59] <nihilazo> linux uses the system jre
[23:16:08] <ChrisTX> bit strange they went with a non-LTS version.
[23:17:13] <r3boot>  /21
[23:17:18] <mrmonday> everyone stuck with java8 because it was/is a massive hassle to upgrade to java 9... upgrading from 9 to 16 can usually be done with no code changes though, so a lot of devs do that
[23:17:50] <mrmonday> things are usually on 8 not because it's LTS, but because it's a lot of work to move to 9 (or, at least, it can be... it depends)

[23:39:53] <MrAureliusR> in the few days since I installed it?
[23:39:54] <alschaapman> Well Pipewire is still pretty new. If you've had Plasma/kwin for more than a few months, the pipewire dependency probably came along after you first installed kwin.
[23:40:04] <Edu4rdSHL> MrAureliusR, yes
[23:40:15] * MrAureliusR facepalms
[23:40:48] <Edu4rdSHL> gst-plugin-pipewire, krfb and kwin are the packages that requires pipewire.
[23:40:53] <alschaapman> Also it's been a dependency of Flatpak and XDG portal for a while. By "a while" I mean maybe a few weeks, couple months... I'm not sure

[23:41:19] <MrAureliusR> urgh this kind of thing annoys me endlessly
[23:41:30] <MrAureliusR> let's hope I have a working soundserver after reboot
[23:41:41] <alschaapman> You don't need to uninstall pipewire in order to not use it as your sound server. I don't know why tf you're even trying to do this
[23:41:49] <thurstylark> pipewire has been a dep of kwin since october of last year... https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-packages/commit/ee16dc5b5a5db0334393780c558c8ec5c4d3bf32#diff-37538beb61ff63edebbf735dfcf39e5d732f49183d6beb097169d971875ca422R12
[23:41:54] <Edu4rdSHL> Well, these are upstream decisions, Arch only add the dependencies

[23:42:01] *** Quits: trev (~trev@user/trev) (Quit: trev)
[23:42:10] <thurstylark> 5.20.0 apparently needed it
[23:42:19] <alschaapman> It seems fairly obvious that it got pulled in as a dependency well before you decided to use it as your sound server, and you just didn't notice
[23:42:24] <Edu4rdSHL> pipewire is getting unavoidable lately, last obs release also depends on it
[23:42:47] *** Joins: AJ_Z0 (~AJ_Z0@user/aj-z0/x-3780512)
[23:42:48] <thurstylark> yup. just because pipewire got installed without your notice doesn't mean it's new

[23:43:58] <Edu4rdSHL> But as alschaapman said, you can have it installed without need to use it as sound server. Anyways the last pipewire release is pretty stable, I switched from pulseaudio to pipewire about 2 weeks ago (when 0.3.29 arrived to repo and it was completely broken)
[23:44:03] *** Quits: saurabhs (~saurabh@183.83.46.108) (Quit: leaving)
[23:44:21] <MrAureliusR> sure, it's stable

[23:44:23] <alschaapman> *I* certainly can't be bothered to keep track of all the packages installed as dependencies on my system.
[23:44:26] <h4rd3n3D> oh, and btw, pipewire works well ;p
[23:44:26] <MrAureliusR> but it sounds like crap
[23:44:38] <MrAureliusR> at least, with my config
[23:44:41] <Edu4rdSHL> Actually I'm using pipewire + wireplumber (instead of pipewire-media-session) and it's working good
[23:44:51] <MrAureliusR> > you can have it installed without need to use it as sound server
[23:44:55] <MrAureliusR> why on earth is that a thing
[23:45:19] <MrAureliusR> what is it doing if pulseaudio is the sound server?
[23:45:26] <thurstylark> that's a thing for many packages available in the repos

[23:49:23] <MrAureliusR> it creates a fake pulseaudio soundserver

[23:49:30] <h4rd3n3D> mongy:  everyone has their own definition of pisspoor HW, but my 12 year old i5 laptop runs pipewire well, as does my newish serious laptop :)
[23:49:33] <alschaapman> nifl: It's similar to what pulseaudio-alsa does when using PulseAudio as a sound server, I think
[23:49:41] <VMGuy234> I'm wondering if the zem kernel would work better than the normal on my poop laptop (secondary, but ultimate poop)
[23:49:47] <VMGuy234> *zen\
[23:49:47] <MrAureliusR> if I wasn't using bluetooth audio for music, I would just use pipewire full-time
[23:50:00] <MrAureliusR> because I like it from a management point of view much better
[23:50:01] <nifl> heard that a certain version of firefox which relied on it . 
[23:50:06] <Betal> could not get null-sink and loopback to work in pipewire, I get a forced mono effect when audio pass the nullsink/loopback
[23:50:34] <alschaapman> MrAureliusR: Surely you must have followed some instructions to set up the Pipewire sound server? Just undo those steps.
[23:50:56] <MrAureliusR> that's exactly what I was trying to do when I first messaged here
[23:51:05] <VMGuy234> My laptop specs are an Intel Atom (i dont know how to check processor speed or number of cores) with1gb ram
[23:51:10] <MrAureliusR> anyway, I think I'm back on pulseaudio now
[23:51:11] <ping2000> pipewire doesnt tell if it can do A/V sync or set specific delays. if you do software dsps you need offsets
[23:51:15] <VMGuy234> would regular or zen be better
[23:51:20] <mongy> h4rd3n3D: it's a miracle I have sound at all.  pipe had a few issues with Xruns now n then and few apps not having sound, last time I used it couple months ago.  Tried it again few days ago, doesn't detect any outputs now. (╯°□°)╯︵  ┻━┻
[23:51:38] <alschaapman> PulseAudio, the way it's packaged for Arch anyway, should start a sound server for you by default if you have it installed.
