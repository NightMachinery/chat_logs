[20:10:41] <f-a> we are alive
[20:10:44] <f-a> and kicking
[20:10:48] <f-a> ciao EvanR , welcome back
[20:12:53] <f-a> what specific terminal do you people use? I get good FPSs on kitty and awful on xterm 
[20:12:57] <f-a> wonder what changes
[20:13:57] <__monty__> Kitty making use of the GPU probably?
[20:14:14] <f-a> could be, could be
[20:14:44] <EvanR> xterm was always the one that was fast back in the day xD
[20:14:51] <EvanR> could play bb demo at full speed
[20:53:10] <ManofLetters[m]> what counts is quality of frames, not quantity
[21:01:50] <EvanR> yes at low FPS you can savor each frame
[21:12:49] <ManofLetters[m]> each pixel
[21:17:37] <f-a> what count is game making, and I have passed last week mostly refactoring
[21:26:28] <ManofLetters[m]> each source code character
[21:28:16] <f-a> what term do you use, ManofLetters[m] 
[21:30:07] <ManofLetters[m]> gnome-terminal

[22:11:34] <sm> FWIW this stack.yaml works... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/9bcef4d2568fefeae09f2596a9c12d4808e46fe6)
[22:12:01] <f-a> thanks! will add it
[22:13:59] <f-a> mhh timers-tick should be in stack too…
[22:18:28] <sm> the newest versions aren't in stackage yet
[22:18:31] <f-a> https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage/issues/6299 are stack maintainers supposed to reply to these messages?
[22:18:39] <sm> should appear there in the next nightly I think
[22:19:55] <sm> ah, you don't have to but if you take no action your package might eventually get disabled in stackage nightly so the depender can be upgraded
[22:20:23] <sm> so yes, it's good to act on them (sometimes it just requires a hackage revision)
[22:21:25] <sm> in an 80x25 Terminal (and similar in iTerm3) on a macbook air m1, balls stays at 60 FPS up to ~1500 :)
[22:21:46] <sm> and in a 200x60 terminal, up to ~350 balls
[22:22:32] * ManofLetters[m] refrains from crude jokes
[22:25:47] <sm> oh yes, my script can't use this version till it lands in nightly. Which requires that timers-tick bounds-updating revision or release for 6299.
[22:26:23] <sm> I'll need to find some way to auto-convert this stack script to a full package
[22:26:46] <sm> for testing not-in-stackage libs, and for packaging purposes
[22:31:27] <ManofLetters[m]> do you mean, to convert to cabal?
[22:33:11] <sm> to a full cabal package, yes
[22:34:29] <sm> so I can get it on hackage. (After 1.0 I might drop the one-file script version)
[22:35:19] <sm> a workflow for script -> package seems useful generally 
[22:37:41] <f-a> ManofLetters[m]: I explicitly named it like so in an act of juvenile frustration
[22:38:17] <f-a> sm: I *did* put a new package on hackage for both a-t-g and timers-tick, but do I need to reply to that ticket or am I just fine with uploading the packages?
[22:38:33] <f-a> also thanks for testing! 1500 balls/60FPS is really impressive
[22:38:35] <f-a> excellent term
[22:39:16] <f-a> I am pretty happy with the revision
[22:40:02] <f-a> if this goes fine I could also add IO callbacks as suggested by icrbow[m]
[22:41:49] <sm> f-a: the main thing you need to do is make timers-tick on hackage compatible with hspec 2.9.0, by a revision increasing that upper bound, or if necessary a new release
[22:42:12] <sm> secondly announce that on the issue as a courtesy
[22:44:41] <sm> oh you already did the first. yes just mention it on the issue, it helps move things along
[22:47:17] <f-a> ah! That is what I was referring to, thanks. I will drop a courtesy message (tho I thought the «they fixed it» checklist was automated!)

[22:48:38] <sm> not that I'm aware, that would be nice though
[22:55:08] <ManofLetters[m]> bot deserve some courtesy, too
[22:55:11] <ManofLetters[m]> s/bot/bots/
[22:59:08] <f-a> yeah, and I have noticed hackage provides RSS feeds too now, so for sure it would be doable
[23:01:06] <f-a> in any case, done
[23:05:39] <EvanR> so uh... I'm looking into graphics options, and am unsurprised that the options aren't that easy to digest
[23:06:04] <f-a> what are you planning to make, EvanR 
[23:06:49] <EvanR> I don't know
[23:07:40] <EvanR> when features grow to a certain point, it becomes like "this needs to be in a browser", and then you have haskell in a browser
[23:07:53] <EvanR> when I was hoping it didn't need to come to that
[23:08:00] <f-a> sdl?
[23:08:16] <icrbow[m]> There's even a fediverse bot
[23:08:16] <icrbow[m]> https://functional.cafe/@hackage
[23:08:21] <EvanR> sdl by itself lets you paint lines, rectangles, raster images 
[23:08:36] <EvanR> but not really text
[23:08:48] <EvanR> or even individual glyphs
[23:09:07] <f-a> not even with sdl-ttf?
[23:09:15] <EvanR> sdl_ttf doesn't really have fine control over presentation, and no control over more advanced glyph formation
[23:09:43] <ManofLetters[m]> are you sure?
[23:09:44] <f-a> what advanced glyph formation do you need, novel Aldo Manuzio? :P
[23:10:07] <EvanR> yeah I'm familiar with sdl_ttf from the decades of old xD
[23:10:10] <EvanR> it's pretty shitty
[23:10:21] <f-a> alas it is a bit of an unfinished job, yes
[23:10:25] <ManofLetters[m]> haha, I'm the maintainer and possibly the main user
[23:10:38] <ManofLetters[m]> so you owe me details
[23:10:55] <EvanR> also quality has not been that impressive
[23:11:07] <EvanR> but I'm not sure if that's even solvable in a feasible way
[23:11:08] <ManofLetters[m]> it's just freetype quality
[23:11:18] <EvanR> right, that
[23:11:26] <ManofLetters[m]> freetype is used in Firefox, isn't it?
[23:11:28] <EvanR> blurry text
[23:11:36] <EvanR> I haven't used firefox in a while
[23:11:47] <ManofLetters[m]> perhaps you don't use proper hinting or antialising?
[23:11:58] <ManofLetters[m]> e.g., with Ubuntu fonts, I needed non-standard hinting
[23:12:20] <ManofLetters[m]> I mean freetype hinting style parameter
[23:12:28] <ManofLetters[m]> light vs heavy or something
[23:12:28] <EvanR> at one point I made a linux from scratch with as much "proper hinting" as I knew to enable and it was ok but still kind of blurry
[23:12:41] <ManofLetters[m]> trying to snap both to X and Y or only to one of them, forgot which
[23:12:56] <ManofLetters[m]> ok, I believe you
[23:13:10] <ManofLetters[m]> just not sure if you had the same set of tools 10 years ago than is available now
[23:13:17] <EvanR> probably not
[23:13:23] <EvanR> right now I'm on windows though
[23:13:34] <ManofLetters[m]> 2 hinting styles, 3 rendering options
[23:13:44] <ManofLetters[m]> some kerning and stuff I don't touch
[23:14:11] <ManofLetters[m]> *by rendering options I mean the amount of antialising/transparency
[23:16:12] <EvanR> the quality aspect is really kind of a tangent, though it's probably fixed by using a dang "actually a browser" front end
[23:16:57] <ManofLetters[m]> anyway, thanks for the feedback :)
[23:17:15] <EvanR> you're really the maintainer of SDL_TTF?
[23:17:25] <f-a> no I am, he is of sdl2 ttf
[23:17:26] <ManofLetters[m]> yep and the sole one
[23:17:32] <f-a> (both: bindings)
[23:17:34] <EvanR> sdl_ttf 2
[23:17:35] <ManofLetters[m]> but not the C stuff, the Haskell bindings
[23:17:37] <EvanR> oh
[23:17:46] <EvanR> nvm xD
[23:18:03] <EvanR> I was going to ask for the whole intended scope and future directions for the poor thing
[23:18:07] *** Quits: joes (~joes@2a02:8109:1b3f:b214:c989:cb3a:960a:d80b) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[23:18:07] <ManofLetters[m]> oh, so you were taking about SDL1?
[23:18:11] <EvanR> no
[23:18:11] <ManofLetters[m]> phew
[23:18:15] <EvanR> the C code
[23:18:29] <ManofLetters[m]> the SDL2 C code?
[23:18:32] <EvanR> though sdl 1.2 is a nice vintage xD
[23:18:41] <f-a> EvanR: I do not think sdl people grasp the finer details of it
[23:18:44] <EvanR> framebuffers rock
[23:19:06] <EvanR> or did
[23:19:19] <f-a> they don’t grasp the usefulness of making proper releases
[23:19:35] <ManofLetters[m]> SDL2_ttf is really a rather thin shell over freetype, though they are adding some stuff now (but not release)
[23:19:40] <ManofLetters[m]> yeah
[23:20:07] <f-a> how text heavy you plan to go EvanR ?
[23:20:20] <f-a> simple games can live with suboptimal typesetting
[23:20:43] <EvanR> I'd like the change the colors of individual letters, maybe put underlines or strikethroughs
[23:20:57] <f-a> icrbow[m]: nice to know (re: package bot)
[23:21:15] <ManofLetters[m]> will it be bitmap fonts?
[23:21:24] <f-a> is raster that bad for you?
[23:21:28] <ManofLetters[m]> because then the problem of quality is gone
[23:21:30] <EvanR> no I'd like to have a magnifying glass
[23:21:43] <EvanR> so like 2 zoom levels
[23:21:44] <ManofLetters[m]> :<
[23:21:58] <ManofLetters[m]> if it's x2, still perfect
[23:22:02] <f-a> yeah
[23:22:05] <f-a> have some filter
[23:22:12] <EvanR> point being to appreciate the detail of the vector graphics fonts xD
[23:22:28] <f-a> hehe ok definitely not raster then
[23:22:30] <EvanR> and other vector graphics
[23:22:39] <EvanR> emojis, diagram maybe
[23:22:44] <f-a> definitely definitely not raster
[23:23:21] <ManofLetters[m]> I've actually created a bitmap font and converted from it to TTF
[23:23:27] <ManofLetters[m]> best (or worst) of both worlds
[23:23:34] <EvanR> yes TTF can stored bitmap fonts
[23:23:41] <ManofLetters[m]> not that way
[23:23:43] <ManofLetters[m]> really scalable
[23:23:50] <EvanR> weird xD
[23:24:06] <ManofLetters[m]> pixels turned into vector squares
[23:24:13] <ManofLetters[m]> and then you resize them at will
[23:24:18] <EvanR> that's... so cursed xD
[23:24:19] <ManofLetters[m]> probably also deform, etc.
[23:24:22] <f-a> make a game on paper
[23:24:28] <ManofLetters[m]> but that's beyond SDL2_ttf
[23:24:43] <EvanR> you literally took "a pixel is not a little square" and said "yeah it is" lol
[23:24:43] <f-a> https://fafa2.itch.io/hunt-in-trieste I did for postcard jam with scribus, people like the font
[23:25:18] <f-a> I once made a small something with ghcjs, it was not bad
[23:25:32] <EvanR> >make a game on paper
[23:25:37] <EvanR> elaborate xD
[23:25:46] <EvanR> paper supports so much more than a lot of stuff I find
[23:26:04] <ManofLetters[m]> I guess, both of you guys totally ignore enthusiastic emojis sticked to your lines on Matrix?
[23:26:19] <EvanR> I do not see any emojis
[23:26:27] <EvanR> good to know matrix is doing that
[23:26:43] <ManofLetters[m]> no, Matrix users are doing that
[23:26:57] <f-a> well EvanR , itch.io has some «postcard game jam» (write a playable «game»  on a postcard) [not source on a postcad, mind you]
[23:27:00] <ManofLetters[m]> like @sm, ic.rbow, me
[23:27:07] <f-a> so you releae it as PDF
[23:27:22] <EvanR> I feel left out by not seeing the emojis
[23:27:34] <f-a> ManofLetters[m]: try to spam some emojis please
[23:27:56] <f-a> (I am seeing nothing)
[23:27:57] <ManofLetters[m]> ☠️'
[23:28:02] <f-a> ok I am now
[23:28:05] <f-a> we are part of it

[23:28:26] <EvanR> hmm
[23:28:27] <ManofLetters[m]> and your emojis are not renedred
[23:28:34] <EvanR> I only saw the standalone one

[23:28:49] <f-a> yep only standalone
[23:29:08] <f-a> inform us if our messages cause sensation
[23:30:14] <EvanR> hunt in trieste sounds awesome
[23:31:02] <f-a> it is a cyoa in a postcard, with a twist
[23:31:23] <f-a> I have received positive comments, which is weird — nowadays people are usually scared by text. 
[23:31:37] <sm> I avoid reaction emojis in irc-bridged channels for this reason, but occasionally I'll drop one in for the matrix users
[23:32:37] <sm> a pity, they're useful
[23:33:01] <f-a> I suspect that soon we all be over to matrix, if ircv3 lags behind
[23:33:12] <EvanR> I've never used matrix
[23:34:15] <sm> I guess the bridge could represent them as "+1" messages or similar
[23:35:06] <EvanR> the traffic in here seems low enough that might pass, but under normal circumstances reaction emojis not being whole messages is great xD
[23:37:18] <EvanR> so svg-tree haskell library is a thing and looks good
[23:37:22] <EvanR> cairo exists
[23:37:34] <EvanR> is there a thing that can join them... i.e. render the svg
[23:40:04] <sm> ohh hunt in trieste is awesome ! never saw one of those
[23:40:29] <f-a> check the other postcard game jam entries, they had nice ideas too

[23:40:58] <f-a> rip
