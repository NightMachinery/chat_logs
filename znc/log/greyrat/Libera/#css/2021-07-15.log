[21:59:51] <entuland> when you hover on first stat and slowly move the mouse to the second level it pops out, there is a gap where the hover goes to the surroundings of the page and the second level disappears
[22:00:31] <entuland> https://i.imgur.com/XPIk4y5.png
[22:00:48] <entuland> as you move the mouse just to the right of First Stat, the second level menu disappears
[22:01:03] <drej> that's a menu? not just a tooltip / details?
[22:01:08] <drej> also it flickers when you move from bullet point to text
[22:01:48] <entuland> yeah I guess they're learning how to create menus, that's what I gathered from previous interactions
[22:02:15] <entuland> ideally the bullet should go, if that's going to be a menu of sorts
[22:02:24] <Rockwood> yes i am trying to understand the element selection
[22:02:26] <entuland> but maybe I recall wrong
[22:03:02] <entuland> all of that decoration you put in the popup makes it hard to understand clearly what I mean
[22:05:24] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/uyhq963a/ now i will add this concept
[22:05:46] <Rockwood> this is lovely
[22:11:35] <Rockwood> is possible without hover?
[22:12:13] <entuland> what would you like to use instead of the hover?
[22:12:15] <entuland> a click?
[22:12:34] <Rockwood> any other way like hover
[22:12:41] <entuland> I don't understand
[22:12:50] <entuland> either you want the hover or you don't
[22:12:52] <Rockwood> my concern about touch screen
[22:13:09] <entuland> you shouldn't be using such type of menus on mobile at all
[22:13:17] <Rockwood> like hover which works on touch screen too
[22:13:33] <entuland> there is no such a thing, you need the equivalent of the click
[22:13:42] <Rockwood> okay
[22:14:01] <entuland> which you can achieve with <details> - it has a built-in open / close feature that doesn't require CSS
[22:14:23] <Rockwood> html tag
[22:14:26] <entuland> yes
[22:15:17] <Rockwood> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details
[22:15:22] <Rockwood> i found this
[22:15:40] <entuland> that's the one
[22:16:03] <Rockwood> but its need click
[22:16:08] <entuland> notice how there is no CSS / JS to handle anything here: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/14vdwbnu/
[22:16:24] <entuland> yes, it requires the click
[22:17:44] <Rockwood> okay
[22:18:02] <entuland> if you want to allow both hover and click at the same time, you need some more markup
[22:18:35] <Rockwood> right now my focus to learn css
[22:19:04] <entuland> well, this is part of it, it's just matter of learning the techniques involved in achieving a specific goal
[22:20:37] <Rockwood> suppose if i use JS for this work then will it effect in any thing?
[22:20:50] <entuland> I don't understand the question
[22:21:29] <Rockwood> suppose if i toggle by JS then is it bad idea?
[22:21:48] <Rockwood> for replacement of hover in css
[22:22:09] <entuland> you can get both the click and hover at the same time without JS

[22:22:26] <Rockwood> hows?
[22:22:42] <Rockwood> click and hover both?
[22:22:56] <Rockwood> by our functions?
[22:23:04] <entuland> yep, probably with :focus-within somehow, I don't remember the exact technique
[22:24:48] <Rockwood> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within
[22:25:41] <entuland> yeah it's a sketchy technique to an extent, it requires using a checkbox or so
[22:27:34] <Rockwood> ok

[22:30:03] <Rockwood> entuland, is correct now? https://codepen.io/cyberia/pen/YzVpXNq?editors=1111
[22:30:16] <Rockwood> i have done less gap now
[22:31:29] <entuland> yeah, I wouldn't focus too much on that kind of things, unless you know for a fact you want that kind of menu going horizontal - they're a mess because you need to give them a fixed width
[22:31:44] <entuland> vertical menues are way easier to achieve and less annoying
[22:32:16] <Rockwood> okay
[22:32:27] <entuland> but then you may want the first level horizontal opening vertical, the second level in the vertical opening another vertical level to the side, and things get messy quite easily
[22:32:34] <entuland> it's probably better not to use them at all
[22:33:28] <Rockwood> in this i wanna make one level menu
[22:33:31] <entuland> there is also the problem of the level root being a link itself leading to another page or not
[22:33:31] <Rockwood> just
[22:34:20] <Rockwood> means?
[22:34:26] <entuland> if you want to read more about it, this article covers some of the above in a decent way: https://css-tricks.com/in-praise-of-the-unambiguous-click-menu/
[22:34:41] <entuland> if you really want to go for a menu, go for a click menu, not a hover one
[22:35:05] <entuland> will work the same on desktop and mobile, and will be way easier to implement, by just using the details built-in behavior that requires no CSS at all
[22:35:09] <Rockwood> actually i am looking for gaming purpose stuffs
[22:35:32] <entuland> doesn't matter, if it's a browser game, you're still in a browser
[22:36:08] <entuland> there is plenty of games where menus are click menus and not hover menus
[22:41:30] <Rockwood> ok
