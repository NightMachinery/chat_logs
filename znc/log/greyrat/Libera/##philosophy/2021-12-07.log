[03:14:31] <tomathy> now that is a horror of horrors
[03:14:45] <Delf> It's irrelevant. If we nuke at such scale, it would make too much noise. Others will hear it and they won't have it. We're already scheduled for extermination, they'll just re-schedule our extinction.
[03:15:27] <tomathy> we're gonna find out COVID was Chinese systematic political assassinations and "revenge" for their "colonial age of humiliation"

[03:52:15] <biys> i get that...  but you're classifying them in such a way
[03:52:15] <causative> capitalism is in theory good *if* there is fair competition - competition drives prices down to the marginal cost, and also drives the marginal cost down, which benefits consumers.  Problem is, every corporation does its best to avoid competition whenever it can
[03:52:19] <biys> i'm asking about your metrics
[03:52:34] <biys> the determination and valuation of your metrics
[03:52:56] <causative> by making a product only they can make (monopoly), by raising barriers to entry to prevent startups from competing, by collusion with the other major players, by buying legislation

[03:53:14] <causative> by buying up competitors
[03:53:54] <causative> yeah capitalism fails in medicine for those reasons *and* because of asymmetry of information; the customer isn't a medical expert so he cannot judge the value of what he is buying, so competition among medical providers cannot happen.

[03:56:32] <plankster> capitalism? problem!
[03:57:16] <causative> capitalism is good *if* the government aggressively enforces laws to detect and stop monopoly/oligopoly tactics, and promote real competition
[03:57:51] <causative> if the government does not do this, which it does not, capitalism is - well, it is economically productive, but certainly not all it could be

[04:22:40] <I_Am_M00t> i declare any opinion that deviates from mine as wrong

[04:31:09] <Delf> Reality is an anomaly of our evolving perception
[04:34:39] <Delf> Truth is not more important than our coexistence, cooperation and evolution. The latter three are foundational and the deciding factor for our continued existence. Otherwise we guarantee our extinction! :)

[04:58:42] <causative> when a dictator lies to you, usually they lie in a way that makes them look great, so you will support them even though they don't deserve it.  Often they lie about the supposed crimes of their enemies, so you will help hurt those enemies.

[04:59:58] <causative> yes
[05:00:24] <causative> whenever the Enemy uses force to suppress dissent without discussion, we can assume they are doing so for malevolent reasons - because discussion of the truth would make them look bad

[05:01:59] <causative> yeah sure, Mao Zedong says "let's hold discussion groups every day after you work in the fields."  No dissent allowed of course.
[05:02:11] <causative> "discussion" without "dissent" is not real discussion

[05:09:16] <Delf> So I'm deceptive, lying, dishonest and I pretend to joke, when I'm actually not or I use it as  a tactic... and this all for what, to abuse you?
[05:10:37] <causative> very well, if you were joking, then tell me *without* joking what you would do if you were a dictator
[05:10:54] <causative> and how it's different from what you said
[05:11:35] <Delf> I'd gather around people who are interested in making systems that are good. To restructure our society. We need to build a bridge from current conditions to ideal conditions.
[05:11:58] <causative> that's entirely consistent with what you said when you were "joking"
[05:12:24] <Delf> That part is not a joke
[05:13:09] <Delf> Can you explain to me, your humor? What makes you laugh? Logically.
[05:13:20] <causative> it's also entirely consistent with what vicious dictators say
[05:13:28] <Delf> My humor is simple, it's contradictory. It's self-loathing.
[05:14:03] <causative> vicious dictators give lots of platitudes about how great everything will be under their rule - "but don't ever cross or contradict me or you might disappear," everyone can read between the lines.
[05:14:36] <Delf> What would you have me do about that? Those fuckers said whatever they said, what they thought you wanted to hear... I'm not concerned with what you want to hear. I'm merely stating my intention
[05:15:16] <Delf> I have 0 problems with people disagreeing with me
[05:15:51] <Delf> I need other point of view. I need more perspective. This way we build more accurate data
[05:16:28] <Delf> This is like the guy crying wolves. Are you familiar with it?
[05:17:23] <causative> well, if that's true about your actual attitude towards disagreement, then good
[05:19:30] <Delf> Do I actually seem aggressive towards others when they disagree with me?
[05:20:25] <causative> Delf, a joke has three parts.  First there must be some setup that everyone is more or less familiar with. Then there must be a twist, something that's kind of consistent with part of the setup, so that you can see there's a logical connection between the setup and the twist, while at the same time the twist is very unexpected or doesn't entirely make sense.
[05:20:49] <causative> third, there must be some element of negativity, especially in the twist
[05:20:56] <Delf> That's one kind of a joke
[05:21:17] <causative> all funny jokes are like that
[05:21:27] <causative> anything you'd actually laugh at
[05:21:46] <Delf> Hmm.. do you laugh at your own jokes?
[05:21:57] <causative> not usually
[05:22:07] <Delf> See... I do, I laugh most to my own jokes.
[05:22:58] <Delf> Probably because I don't look too much at stand up comedy or similar
[05:24:13] <Delf> Envision yourself being very similar to how you are not, with the wits and all, but... add to it a very stupid ignorance and pride on top of that. Would you laugh at yourself then?
[05:24:25] <Delf> s/not/now/
[05:24:25] <ro-bot-o> Delf meant to say: Envision yourself being very similar to how you are now, with the wits and all, but... add to it a very stupid ignorance and pride on top of that. Would you laugh at yourself then?
[05:25:14] <causative> the "twist" needs an element of surprise or the joke isn't funny
[05:25:28] <causative> so usually we don't laugh at our own jokes because we aren't surprised, because we thought of it
[05:25:38] <Delf> Hmm...
[05:26:00] <causative> and yes, ignorance and pride can be funny, but only if incorporated into a complete joke with all three parts
[05:26:02] <Delf> This requirement is not mandatory
[05:26:22] <Delf> Perhaps it is for you
[05:26:33] <Delf> This is very interesting indeed
[05:27:22] <Delf> Many people consider me fucking weird, because of my humor...
[05:27:55] <Delf> For example, if we're shooting guns, and I pick up a gun, I can make a joke and say... now you can no longer afford to disagree with me.
[05:28:31] <Delf> Would you not laugh?
[05:28:34] <plankster> no
[05:28:37] <plankster> thats a threat
[05:28:39] <Delf> WTF!
[05:28:51] <plankster> also are you talking to yourself or to somebody i have ignored
[05:30:38] <Delf> A friend of mine would've instantly said... (after having laughed of course) I disagree with you. I can always afford to disagree with you.
[05:32:45] <Delf> Most likely someone you've ignored, plankster. Why in the hell would you ignore them? He's one of the most honorable person in this channel
[05:33:00] <plankster> no that guys a cunt
[05:33:09] <Delf> How?
[05:33:19] <plankster> by being a cunt
[05:33:31] <Delf> How is he being a cunt!?
[05:33:40] <plankster> idk i have him ignored
[05:34:01] <Delf> You guys have probably just misunderstood each other
[05:34:51] <plankster> no he was being a jerk so i ignored him
[05:35:26] <Delf> How was he being a jerk?
[05:36:05] <plankster> i dont recall and i dont really care
[05:39:08] <Delf> That is heavy mate... If you ever make it to my shit list, I'll be able to explain to you, in detail, how you end up there and why.
[05:39:35] <plankster> k
[05:39:46] <Delf> My memory generally sucks shit. But I never forget core fundamental problems of others
[05:42:02] <causative> looks like plankster probably ignored me because I wouldn't agree with him that all truth is subjective and everybody inhabits their "own reality"

[05:43:49] <causative> I would not laugh at that
[05:43:59] <causative> if you picked up a gun and said I could no longer afford to disagree with you
[05:44:24] <causative> it's the kind of humor that's half-serious and would make me uncomfortable
[05:44:51] <causative> "kidding on the square"
[05:44:55] <Delf> I'd laugh my ASS off if you picked up a gun and said I could no longer afford to disagree with you
[05:45:43] <causative> like, you probably didn't *actually* mean you'd shoot me if I disagreed, but the underlying sentiment is probably sincere and not a joke - i.e. "don't disagree with me or I'll find some way to punish you for it"
[05:45:50] <causative> there are a *lot* of people who think that way
[05:46:34] <causative> and a person who thinks that way is the kind of person who would want to make a joke like that
[05:46:47] <Delf> Noo...
[05:47:05] <Delf> Can you explain why I would laugh if you made that joke?
[05:48:11] <causative> well, it legitimately is a joke, I will grant you that - it is an appropriate response to laugh at it.  But I wouldn't laugh at it because the subtext is too serious, it comes from a common mindset of seriously wanting to punish people for disagreeing
[05:48:45] <causative> it does have the three elements of a joke I described earlier
[05:48:56] <causative> setup, twist, negativity
[05:49:23] <Delf> I would not laugh, if you were the kind of person you described that makes such jokes

[05:54:13] <causative> but you'd be very strange if you didn't *also* have a feeling, at least initially, that you don't like what they said and want to discredit them in return
[05:54:32] <causative> you don't have to act on this feeling but virtually everyone has it - and most people do act on it
[05:54:39] *** Quits: kmh (~kmh@2a00:6020:5004:6800:8485:34d7:7cf1:8b35) (Client Quit)
[05:54:53] <Delf> You don't even have to have this feeling
[05:55:28] <causative> it's hard to know everything that's going on in your mind
[05:55:40] <Delf> I have had, I can recognize it. And I remember me having it and I can explain why I had it also. And I can explain why I no longer have the feeling also.
[05:56:40] <causative> there's the face you present to the world, which may also be how you think of yourself, and to construct this face there's a lot of denial of baser impulses
[05:57:02] <causative> so if you don't introspect very carefully the impulse is to only present the parts of yourself that make you look good
[05:57:23] <causative> and to disbelieve you have bad parts, and not look too hard for them or give much credence to them
[05:58:29] <Delf> I've recorded myself while having a discussion with a friend, for science of course. My facial expressions are outsourced to the copilot so to speak. I do not consciously make facial expressions
[05:59:05] <biys> you likely do
[05:59:12] <biys> they've just become so automatic you don't notice them
[05:59:57] <Delf> I likely do what? Make facial expressions consciously?
[06:00:10] <biys> convey your body language in such a way
[06:00:47] <Delf> I have very expressive facial expressions, at least from what I've seen
[06:01:44] <Delf> Have I not said that I develop both sides equally? My benevolent side and my malevolent side?
[06:14:32] <audrey> Why would you want to develop your malevolent side?
[06:14:46] <audrey> Unless the conversation is about, I don´t know, sadomasochism
[06:16:11] <biys> audrey: you gonna watch HellBound you Netflix?
[06:16:17] <biys> did you watch squid games?
[06:18:18] <audrey> I don´t have a Netflix subscription
[06:18:24] <biys> oh
[06:18:32] <audrey> Sorry :(
[06:20:40] <audrey> «you Netflix» - is that how people address each other these days? or presumably a typo ?
[06:20:42] <audrey> :P
[06:22:06] <Delf> You must be severely unsober (mentally incapacitated), if I'm to get uncomfortable when you make such a joke. You seem conscious enough to notice your weaknesses. That in combination with your benevolence, I see no danger but rather the contradiction which is why I would laugh in the first place. The second reason I'd laugh is because death does not end me, but you don't know that and it's
[06:22:08] <Delf> probably not worth finding out either :)
[06:22:47] <audrey> oh man, my two favourite personalities facing off. there is a perfect Russian expression for this that is a bit too obscene to say in English here
[06:23:09] <audrey> biys: Anyway I hate just killing a conversation with a flat «no» so to follow up - anything in particular about that show that´s interesting?
[06:24:55] <Delf> causative: It would not be inappropriate to laugh, should I make such a joke while heavily drugged as even in such conditions, my judgment is sound.
[06:26:01] <biys> HellBound, from the best i can tell with the 10 minutes i've watched it so far, is about the judgements as a result of being evil
[06:26:17] <biys> it's dark
[06:26:35] <biys> netflix seems to be coming out with some good dark content recently
[06:28:08] <audrey> Last show I watched like that was HBO´s Black Mirror which I liked
[06:29:15] <audrey> My ex fiancée recommended it. Every episode works as a standalone story, which is a welcome break from the usual «filler» you have to run in a multi-episode plotline.
[06:29:46] <audrey> We ended up watching all the episodes but one, which was unexpectedly low quality
[06:41:11] <audrey> Probably not something I´d re-watch, though
[06:41:13] <audrey> Too gory

[10:46:32] <betashaft> what is everyones thought on the delineation between erotic art and pornography
[10:46:47] <plankster> if it makes you horny, its porn
[10:47:16] <brigand> what if normal porn doesn't make me horny anymore?
[10:47:29] <mnemon> if there's no intercourse, it's eroticism
[10:47:35] <plankster> then find weirder porn, duh
[10:48:03] <brigand> define intercourse
[10:48:06] <plankster> mnemon what about intracourse
[10:48:28] <mnemon> I guess that's slightly porny
[10:48:30] <brigand> what if it suggests intercourse?
[10:49:27] <plankster> the question for me is: can i fap to this?
[10:49:29] <betashaft> So how about Batailles Story of the Eye
[10:49:37] <betashaft> is that porn
[10:50:03] <plankster> thing is, i dont consider porn and art to be mutually exclusive
[10:50:13] <plankster> so id call story of the eye both
[10:52:14] <betashaft> but it feels like there is a difference between porn and erotic art right? Porn isn't consumed for it's artistic value, and presumably, Story of the eye isn't widely used as a tool for nutting
[10:52:21] <plankster> the french are fucked up anyway, not the best example
[10:53:14] <plankster> well like, you can be reading story of the eye and get the urge to orgasm from it
[10:53:34] <plankster> then you might finish it off by fantasizing about one of the scenes
[10:53:59] <plankster> also, porn with artistic value is usually going to be better than the tasteless stuff
[10:54:24] <betashaft> what do you mean by better though?
[10:54:41] <betashaft> was is the qualitative factor of making porn good or bad?
[10:54:52] <plankster> cinematography in general is widely recognized as an art. i dont see why applying that art to recording people fucking would make it any less artful
[10:55:04] <brigand> define tasteless
[10:55:07] <plankster> no accounting for taste
[10:55:46] <betashaft> I mean cinematography usually is good in so far as it conveys mood
[10:55:50] <plankster> peculiar pieces of art will always hold more attraction for some than it will for others
[10:56:05] <betashaft> porn cinematography is mostly good if it gives a good view of the action
[10:56:23] <betashaft> which i think both have merit, but maybe not in terms of artistically
[10:56:28] <plankster> at its base level, sure. but theres also the transitions, the flow of the picture
[10:58:06] <brigand> i like ahegao art

[15:32:55] <pussipupu> If so I've seen videos of it, if not I don't know what you're referring to :p
[15:33:10] <arryana> i think i read that this one has motors to keep it going
[15:33:20] <arryana> but perhaps it's mostly river fed

[15:36:58] <pussipupu> Ah, what I've seen(in videos) is a disc rather than a doughnut, that's pretty cool
[15:37:32] <pussipupu> I wonder how much trouble I'd get into for cutting holes in the river, and if I'd drown
[15:39:34] <arryana> haha

[17:32:00] <mnemon> pussipupu: if you cut them just for giggles without marking them I foresee a lynch party in your future when someone falls in and drowns ;D

[18:14:12] <mnemon> pussipupu: some purpose for them in mind?
[18:14:35] <pussipupu> Or buy a river and use decent warning lights
[18:14:48] <pussipupu> on a related note, buy me a river
[18:16:36] <mnemon> I don't think you can buy rivers

[18:22:03] <mnemon> might be able to buy full access if you own all the land areas surrounding a pond ... and land areas close to the waters do usually have a stake in them which mostly means you're allowed to use nets an fish-traps etc.

[20:31:57] <darklambdda> was busy trying out guitar softwares
[20:32:17] <audrey> Cool
[20:32:23] <darklambdda> was reviewing a few last weekend... to pick something during the extended cybermonday sale
[20:32:38] <darklambdda> now i realized.. after that sale.. there's holiday season sale also.. haha
[20:33:11] <darklambdda> but the cybermonday sale was better.. at least $25 better for the product that i ended up getting
[20:33:19] <darklambdda> perhaps not much...
[20:33:59] <darklambdda> but was contented as it was an informed decision... only bought after comparing various alternatives
[20:34:41] <darklambdda> had to spend time checking out features though.. and had to do it soon because the deals have deadlines...
[20:34:46] <darklambdda> how's everyone?
[20:37:16] <audrey> I´m all right, I think
[20:37:19] <audrey> Been quiet in the channel today

[20:44:39] <darklambdda> hehe
[20:44:56] <audrey> I need to get a life, probably
[20:45:03] <audrey> Been cooped up for 18 months working at home here
[20:47:08] <audrey> Thing is, I don really know what to *do* with myself now
[20:47:36] <audrey> I´m writing a novel and resurrecting my old piano repertoire, but I need to add some social activities to the mix, too.
[20:48:38] <darklambdda> there are lots of things to do in life... if only i have more time...  had to allocate time for work and stuff though.. some things required for survival

[20:50:25] <audrey> I go through periods where I write prolifically, but those alternate with times I just sit in front of the computer dumbly with the drool coming out of my mouth.
[20:51:35] <darklambdda> are you writing as a profession?
[20:52:28] <audrey> No, just on my own time.
