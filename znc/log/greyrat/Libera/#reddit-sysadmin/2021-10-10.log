[05:55:02] <vonunov> Hunterkll: It was a grand time, so many accounts in Pidgin. The peak for me was around 2012 when I got Skype running on a remote VPS, through a couple of different wrappers, to bitlbee in irssi
[05:55:04] <cryptic1> it integrates so well
[05:57:14] <Hunterkll> vonunov: wtf is wrong with you

[06:10:36] <Hunterkll> the fuck did you expect?
[06:10:42] <dragonfleas> i expected it to not run
[06:10:49] <Hunterkll> I dumped $700 into my original xbox in mods in the early 2000s lol
[06:10:50] <dragonfleas> or at least for them not to have official support
[06:11:05] <dragonfleas> they literally have an entire jira category for xbox functionality
[06:11:05] <Hunterkll> clear frosted case, XIR, Xecutor3 mod chip, front panel with USB ports and bank select switches, etc 
[06:11:25] <Hunterkll> i really want to build one again lol

[06:12:16] <dragonfleas> i'm really tired of windows
[06:12:23] <dragonfleas> now that EAC is working in proton, i may switch back to linux
[06:12:26] <Hunterkll> yea i felt like that in 2004 
[06:12:27] <Hunterkll> lol
[06:12:32] <Hunterkll> then i grew up
[06:12:40] <dragonfleas> it's fucking gaming that's kept me away from linux man
[06:12:56] <Hunterkll> 1.4ghz, that was it
[06:13:04] <Hunterkll> yea keeping me away from linux now is getting shit done in general
[06:13:05] <Hunterkll> lol
[06:13:21] <Hunterkll> win8 was the first post-XP release that was good enough under the hood to actually use as a desktop OS again
[06:13:22] <Hunterkll> lol
[06:14:04] <dragonfleas> the start menu conundrum wasn't as bad as people make it out to be tbh, yeah it sucked, but like still usable
[06:14:10] <Hunterkll> well
[06:14:13] <Hunterkll> i absolutely miss it

[06:15:07] <dragonfleas> yep
[06:15:15] <dragonfleas> hate it

[06:16:02] <Hunterkll> there's no confusion, they just work 
[06:16:04] <dragonfleas> yeah the signing shit is annoying as fuck to me
[06:16:14] <Hunterkll> .... ?
[06:16:25] <Hunterkll> you can install whatever j random appx you want....
[06:16:40] <Hunterkll> msix+appx = future

[06:19:54] <Hunterkll> i updated avalaunch on my xbox
[06:19:57] <Hunterkll> and got that wallpaper
[06:20:02] <Hunterkll> got in trouble with my gf for that
[06:20:06] <Hunterkll> I WAS LIKE I JUTS UPDATED IT IDK 
[06:20:07] <Hunterkll> XD
[06:20:15] <dragonfleas> that smells like early 2000's anime conventions
[06:20:36] <Hunterkll> lol this woulda been 2009
[06:20:45] <Hunterkll> the launcher update had that special christmas wallpaper
[06:21:11] <dragonfleas> bruh
[06:21:20] <dragonfleas> windows 11 adds support for standalone linux GUI apps?????
[06:21:24] <dragonfleas> fuck yeah
[06:21:26] <Hunterkll> ......
[06:21:36] <Hunterkll> slow as shit apparently, and it's been in win10 insider builds for ages
[06:21:54] <dragonfleas> i never run insider builds lol
[06:22:00] <Hunterkll> your loss
[06:22:12] <Hunterkll> only thing i run "production" builds on is my work laptop lol 
[06:22:13] <dragonfleas> sucks, wonder if it's better to run in a DE
[06:22:16] <Hunterkll> cuz i can't run insider for work 
[06:22:21] <Hunterkll> no as in 
[06:22:29] <Hunterkll> even with a DE it wouldn't matter?
[06:22:36] <Hunterkll> don't think you can even run a DE except the support bits 
[06:22:39] <Hunterkll> just single apps 
[06:22:57] <dragonfleas> i'm pretty sure i've seen someone running lxde on WSL
[06:23:03] <Hunterkll> https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/blob/main/docs/WSLg_IntegratedDesktop.png?raw=true
[06:23:05] <Hunterkll> like this
[06:23:29] <Hunterkll> all apps but edge and windows calc are linux/WSL
[06:23:55] <dragonfleas> that image triggers a panic reaction for me
[06:24:08] <Hunterkll> dragonfleas: but yes, WSLg has been available since a april of this year
[06:24:09] <Hunterkll> lol
[06:24:24] <Hunterkll> https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/04/21/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-21364/
[06:24:36] <dragonfleas> i don't support windows professionally anymore, so it makes sense i know absolutely 0 about it XD i don't keep up with shit anymore
[06:24:54] <Hunterkll> ye i just run insider because i'm impatient 
[06:24:55] <Hunterkll> lol
[06:25:48] <Hunterkll> dragonfleas: hilariously, that was supposed to be the fall release of windows 10 
[06:25:51] <dragonfleas> how stable are features when they come to insider
[06:25:58] <Hunterkll> i've had almost no issues
[06:26:02] <Hunterkll> like one or two quirks here and there but 
[06:26:05] <Hunterkll> shit just works
[06:26:25] <Hunterkll> ocasionally you get like
[06:26:28] <Hunterkll> explorer randomly crashing
[06:26:35] <Hunterkll> you can just roll back to previous build and keep on truckin' 
[06:26:43] <dragonfleas> yeah i've avoided insider builds because i'm afraid of running into weird fucking system wide bugs that fuck me, i have awful luck with running into one of a kind bugs with any kind of software
[06:26:59] <Hunterkll> yea see
[06:27:02] <Hunterkll> you just roll back
[06:27:03] <Hunterkll> no big deal
[06:27:20] <Hunterkll> and the rea l system-wide breakers they block systems that would have those
[06:27:29] <Hunterkll> like I didnt get a win11 build like, two builds ago
[06:27:34] <Hunterkll> because i'm intune co-managed with sccm 
[06:27:46] <Hunterkll> and that apparently caused random BSODs, so they blocked any machine with intune detected
[06:27:47] <Hunterkll> lol
[06:28:41] <Hunterkll> see you'll see shit like
[06:28:42] <Hunterkll> "Fixed an issue that was making some PCs unable to progress past the boot screen when upgrading to 224xx builds with certain SSDs attached.
[06:28:42] <Hunterkll> "
[06:28:46] <Hunterkll> but in reality, to you
[06:28:52] <Hunterkll> it just means you wait, it reverts, and you carry on
[06:29:31] <Hunterkll> yea here's the note
[06:29:32] <Hunterkll> Insider PCs that are Mobile Device Managed (MDM) will not receive this build. There is an issue in this build that prevents PCs from successfully updating to this build. We hope to have this fixed in the next flight.
[06:29:53] <Hunterkll> basically they internally tested, found the bug, released it anyway, but blocked pc's that would hit the bug

[08:07:55] <barred_owl> here is a riddle: why was the catholic  priest mad at the scoutmaster?
[08:08:05] <Hunterkll> JollyRgrs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R--_ATzE6o XD
[08:08:10] <sd> 05<M​antisek> it takes 500mA
[08:08:35] <Hunterkll> @Mantisek minimum spec is that a USB port must provide 500mA
[08:08:38] <Hunterkll> even usb 1.0
[08:08:45] <Hunterkll> most provide 2A these days
[08:09:04] <barred_owl> does anyone have an answer?
[08:09:05] <PattyCakes> I can put clamps on my nipples and lick a lemon to generate 500mA
[08:09:07] <sd> 05<M​antisek> er sorry it requires MORE than that
[08:09:17] <Hunterkll> yea most ports should be fine with that
[08:09:28] <Hunterkll> i mean, powered hub can't hurt but still - they'll provide the same amount per port by spec
[08:09:38] <barred_owl> anyone?
[08:09:50] <sd> 05<M​antisek> nope it wasn't that.

[08:11:51] <barred_owl> BardRT, you have a better punchline
[08:12:33] <sd> 05<M​antisek> well it wasn't the usb hub
[08:12:44] <sd> 05<M​antisek> moved it away from any possible interference or anything that could block it
[08:12:46] <sd> 05<M​antisek> if anything it got worse

[14:15:02] <Casteil> they added support for multiple 'synthetic' temperature triggers to start kicking temperature up... so you can adjust fans based on overall CPU+GPU temps over a period, or for just highish CPU or GPU temps
