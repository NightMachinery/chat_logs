[02:16:02] <halosghost> int-e: I wondered if it ever bothered the maker of that ad that there are clearly some folk who will not buy that logic
[02:16:46] <int-e> :)
[02:18:23] <halosghost> I especially liked the version that was ‚Äúyou wouldn't download a car, would you?‚Äù
[02:18:53] <halosghost> to which I pretty much immediately responded (out loud, iirc), ‚Äú‚Ä¶ I can download a car‚ÄΩ hell yeah!‚Äù and went to try to see if I could
[02:19:07] <Bostik> damn right I would
[02:19:23] <int-e> Was this before or after GTA came out ;)
[02:19:32] <Bostik> welcome the diamond age
[02:20:58] <halosghost> int-e: ü§∑
[02:22:43] <int-e> halosghost: Too serious? I mean we're talking entertainment here... I've downloaded dozens, maybe hundreds of cars in my life, as part of various video games. GTA is just special because it also allows you to steal them :P
[02:23:05] <halosghost> :)
[02:23:27] <halosghost> int-e: I never really played GTA, so the only car-stealing I've done in games was in The Godfather
[02:23:40] <halosghost> (which is a bit of a full-port/rip-off of GTA, so it's pretty much the same thing)
[02:24:30] <halosghost> (unrelated: it's been fun switching between Project Euler and Cryptohack for some personally-paced CTFs)

[19:48:11] <recyclehero> I have been going through a lot with authorities lately. 
[19:48:24] <nadio> anyone here that can dumb down this for me https://sarwiki.informatik.hu-berlin.de/TrueCrypt#Volume_format_specification Header key derivation
[19:48:27] <nadio> ?
[19:48:39] <recyclehero> we are a business which has physical contact with 40 nodes/persons 
[19:48:42] <recyclehero> nadio: hi 
[19:48:49] <recyclehero>  I was designing a IAM on and off for a while 
[19:48:58] <recyclehero> now it has become a urgent task 
[19:49:03] <recyclehero> I want some opinions
[19:49:16] <ms7821> uh oh
[19:49:16] <recyclehero> I want to go passwordless 
[19:49:31] <recyclehero> my inital research candidates where ssh key mechansim, pgp, bitcoin address ... 
[19:49:41] <recyclehero> giving it some thought and desiring to choose the path of least resistance 
[19:50:45] <recyclehero> I am thinking of ssh public and private keys as a means of web service authentication.
[19:52:45] <ms7821> are the users developers, and have you considered/rejected fido2?
[19:52:48] <yawkat> if it's about web services just go with mutual auth
[19:53:27] <ms7821> also, have a chat with someone who doesn't refer to people as "nodes". Security is all about understanding users
[19:54:12] <recyclehero> ms7821: I say node. in case of our business(recycling) it can be a residential complex, maybe smart bin or a janitor
[19:54:42] <recyclehero>  I though of it as a three layer solution: 
[19:54:49] <recyclehero> 1-hash/fingerprint being a digital address
[19:54:55] <recyclehero> 2-public key being the lock of our digital home 
[19:55:05] <recyclehero> 3-private key being the key to their digital home

[19:57:25] <recyclehero> I appreciate hearing some toughts around this implenetation 
[19:59:11] <ms7821> honestly, the whole concept of IAM for a recycling business sounds like massive overkill. what's actually protected behind the authentication?
[19:59:30] <recyclehero> ms7821: digital wallet 
[19:59:33] <ms7821> if it's smart devices phoning home, you can surely deploy keys on them yourselves, and manage rotation
[19:59:36] <ms7821> WHAT

[20:01:13] <recyclehero> labrador: thanks 
[20:02:31] <ms7821> wow, OK, that's slightly different to what I think of for residential recycling
[20:03:01] <recyclehero> we have a hierarchical structure. transporters own some workspace and fleet. recycle drives do the pickup form enlightened citizen. regular senario: recycle drive arrive at the pickup location scans the QR code of the citizen and submit a buy transaction. 
[20:03:20] <ms7821> but I'm still not sure why an IAM system is required. Surely it's just a matter of allocating amounts to a device (like smart meters) and then separately associating that device with a user account
[20:03:43] <ms7821> oh, is this a concept? are you about to say this is built on blockchain?
[20:04:06] *** Quits: Vitto (~Vitto@se-14.nat.univ-paris4.fr) (Quit: Leaving.)
[20:04:29] <labrador> >blockchain
[20:04:30] <labrador> why
[20:04:53] <recyclehero> I have the transactions and pickup schedueling code working for some time but there is no IAM in place and the citizens doesnt see anything digital. these services are now for us(transporters and drivers )
[20:05:18] <recyclehero> ms7821: the architecture is sure event based, so yes I can say a blockchain 
[20:05:29] <recyclehero> CQRS 
[20:06:04] <recyclehero> I want to identify the citizens now
[20:06:51] <ms7821> talk to your users
[20:07:28] <ms7821> and CQRS isn't blockchain, it's graphql
[20:08:31] <recyclehero> see my architecture is based on event. nothing gets deleted and the current world view is calculated based on all the past events. blockchain with now previous blcok hash 
[20:08:35] <recyclehero> no*
[20:08:56] <ms7821> that's just an event-driven architecture
[20:09:04] <ms7821> forget I mentioned blockchain, I'm glad it's not
[20:09:16] <labrador> Also...is blockchain crypto?
[20:09:32] <ms7821> but seriously you need to ask your users what sort of system they expect before deciding on an architecture
[20:09:53] <ms7821> I bet they'd prefer to log in with openid than SSH keys
[20:10:44] <ms7821> and like if this is your first authentication system, don't overengineer it
[20:10:44] <recyclehero> ms7821: looking for tech stuff here than UX. I spend a whole lot of time with the users.
[20:10:59] <recyclehero> I was looking into openid way back for some diffrenet use cases 
[20:11:26] <recyclehero> my tilting toward keys is I dont want to keep their date unencrypted at rest

[20:12:26] <recyclehero> no SSOs no third party no profile no KYC. We initiate them and hand out keys for a permenant secure communication chanell
[20:14:18] <recyclehero> ms7821: the money is the sweet parts and related to why I want to use keys. no money. imagine a full reserved banking system. I put 1000kg of Iron in a place with CCTVs. now you give me 10kg of recyclale trash. I give you 1.2kg token for iron 
[20:14:55] <recyclehero> you should be able to checkout through exchanges like any other 'money'

[20:17:38] <recyclehero> and you can make finanical services accessible to whom has recyclables at hand

[20:27:20] <recyclehero> ssh fingerprint vs public key hash? 
[20:27:23] <ms7821> as I said, it's clear you want to built an independent financial system rather than actually solve anything useful like recycling, so just use whatever blockchain tech is the latest/hippest

[22:31:23] <nadio> one step at the time, PBKDF2 (iteration) + 512bit salt + Password => 2 Keys 256bit long (by splitting it into two strings) => but only one 1 is used to decrypt the header?

[22:35:53] <yawkat> the wiki doesnt say. so, you have to read the code.

[22:41:04] <ms7821> it would imply both are used, though. I don't know why you'd not use the second
[22:45:25] <nadio> ms7821: You can only have one key, and xts mode is just Cipher-mode so nothing todo with it, and the whole thing is only to decrypt the header that contains the actuall key for file system. - This is where I get lost...
[22:46:30] <nadio> and yes I am cross checking with the specs but the code might be out of my ball park https://www.truecrypt71a.com/documentation/technical-details/truecrypt-volume-format-specification/
[22:46:47] <yawkat> nadio: xts uses two keys.
[22:47:39] <yawkat> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_encryption_theory#XTS see the image, key1 and key2.

[22:55:36] <nadio> ahh yawkat second key is for the empty space xts writes over?
[22:55:48] <nadio> or am I totally wondering around with no clue?
[22:55:58] <yawkat> no, the xts cipher mode literally uses two separate keys
