[02:20:21] <bladerunner56740> I mean, from pacman..
[02:20:22] <sangy> the other option is using pacman to install the native runtime (i.e,. pacman -S steam-native-runtime) and use that instead
[02:20:41] <sangy> that will use the runtime libraries from the system, rather than the ones built by valve

[04:41:32] <williewillus> writes seem to go very fast (in memory?) before it *actually* starts writing out to disk, then everything slows down terribly. There is probably some knob i can turn to make throughput worse to improve latency, but I don't know what it is.
[04:42:13] <sheep> did you ever test these disks without encryption?

[04:46:27] <beastDivision> SSD's can only hold high throughput for a short amount of time before their buffer fills and the speed drops to that of a sloth swimming through molasses 
[04:46:34] <beastDivision> especially cheaper SSD's 
[04:46:50] <beastDivision> so if you're doing big data transfers that might be whey you hit such a performance issue 
[04:47:23] <williewillus> is there a way i can trade that throughput for better interactivity?
[04:47:43] <williewillus> i'm fine with my pacman -Syu's taking 1.5x longer as long as the system stays interactive
[04:47:47] <sheep> aes-xts is most likely faster than the drive's throughput or the SATA conrtroller, assuming that it's SATA

[04:48:08] <beastDivision> if you're certain that it's the SSD cache running out, you could find a way to throttle big transfers with something like rsync 
[04:48:28] <sheep> an NVMe SSD should be faster
[04:48:36] <williewillus> what do you mean by rsync?

[05:13:07] <jkhsjdhjs> hey, I was added as a co-maintainer to an aur package to fix some things, which I did. While I was at it, I also changed the source url from ghproxy.com to github.com. the original maintainer is using and wants to keep using ghproxy.com, because github.com apparently isn't accessible by some chinese users and the download speed with github.com is rather slow in china. However, the rest of the
[05:13:07] <jkhsjdhjs> world has a really high ping to ghproxy (270ms for me), otherwise I wouldn't really mind to keep ghproxy as a source. do you have an idea for a solution that would fit for all users?

[06:22:58] <j-james> any tips on sandboxing zoom? the web version lacks features i believe, but i don't trust the native client
[06:23:42] <j-james> is flatpak the go-to here?
[06:24:16] <ishitatsuyuki> maybe
[06:24:28] <ishitatsuyuki> the web version is generally less hassle
[06:24:32] <Repentinus> Most enterprise installations should expose a SIP endpoint that you can call from any video-enabled SIP phone.
[06:24:33] <ishitatsuyuki> no stupid always-on-top etc

[06:25:15] <Repentinus> That is a matter of perspective.
[06:25:50] <ishitatsuyuki> his point is probably that his school uses some of Zoom's proprietary features

[07:06:02] <mpan> Perhaps space issues? Are you cleaning up pacman cache? If not, see the pacman-contrib and its `paccache` tool. I use `paccache -rk3` routinely.
[07:07:22] <mpan> There may be some issues during and just after boot, after file caches get full or some particular pieces of software that naturally random-read tons of files (LibreOffice as an example). But otherwise you should not perceive much slowdown during typical use. Not saying that your particular workload can’t experience it.

[20:05:12] <nimbius> so apparently through dracuts dark unholy machinations it simply...knows...my present setup and through divinations and arcane runes builds the unified EFI image at my command with no kernel options.

[20:05:52] <nimbius> im not ruling out whether dracut could, or has at this point, made my morning porridge in the process but it seems --hostonly strips necessary dependencies from the build, one of which being brltty in some sense.
[20:06:47] <nimbius> meaning my dracut image is a bombastic 90mb, whilst my original kernel was a svelt 34mb.
[20:07:04] <nimbius> is there a safe way to trim the lard from dracut...
[20:07:14] <Namarrgon> are you comparing unified kernel images?

[21:15:00] <kj7rrv> What is the point of installing source AUR packages when -bin packages are available?
[21:16:17] <kj7rrv> -bin packages install a lot faster because they don't need to be compiled, and I can't think of any disadvantages
[21:16:20] <zenof> kj7rrv: building your package from source, especially when from the AUR, gives you more control of what's actually been done.
[21:16:25] <oscen> kj7rrv: Anyone can put anything on the AUR, this includes malicious scripts and whatnot, if you trust the maintainer you can install a -bin package or you can (as intended) look at the source (make sure its safe) and then compile it
[21:16:26] <earnest> What is linuxarc?
[21:16:31] <kj7rrv> Oh okay
[21:16:35] <novns> kj7rrv, -bin packages in AUR are outdated and unmaintained sometimes

[21:17:45] <novns> yes, twice.  and before going to bed too
