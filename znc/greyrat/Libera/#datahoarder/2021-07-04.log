[15:50:33] <Spring> Searched but finding good external 3.5" enclosures with a fan has been a bit fruitless. Are there any known reliable enclosures like this? Looked at both single, 2x and 4x bay JBOD types but each had reviews/impressions about reliability and/or overheating due to baffling fan placement.
[15:53:21] <Spring> Eg: two Icy Box 2x and 4x bay enclosures were slammed by users for corrupting data due (they believe) to its sleep function/controller issues. While another pointed out the PCB entirely blocks the only rear fan. A different with dual fans cooled well enough (and was a rare one to be 'virtually silent') but users experienced corruption issues (unsure if due to older firmware or what).
[15:53:48] <Spring> *a different brand
[15:54:40] <Spring> then there are posts on /r/DataHoarder about eSATA (when port multiplication is present) being generally more reliable than USB for multi-bay enclosures which also limits the choice
[16:05:40] <NiLon> also don't confuse eSATA (external SATA, the obsolete standard) and SATAe (SATA express) :p
[16:14:51] <Spring> yeah, I have 5.25" eSATA enclosure for an optical drive and my system has an eSATA port (thankfully), though its fan is crazy loud :p
