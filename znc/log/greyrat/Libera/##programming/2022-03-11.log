[01:52:50] <nomagno> It's literally just prohibiting traditional extension.
[01:53:28] <nomagno> pyzozord: it's interface segregation
[01:53:28] <sonny> rust might just be a culture thing tbh
[01:53:40] <nomagno> Last one is dependency inversion

[01:54:30] <nomagno> And it's a nightmare now until it is finished
[01:54:45] <Sqaure> sonny, they have some new thing about safe memory allocation wo garbage collection, memory protection, enhancements in typechecking, immutability. I really cant say, I know very little. But i heard a bunch of people are really content with it.
[01:55:09] <sonny> nomagno: I liked how discord? got a boost by using rust
[01:55:14] <pyzozord> lisno liskov is just about subtyping polymorphism as far as I can tell
[01:55:21] <Sqaure> Like, people who are very interested in language design. 
[01:55:22] <CalimeroTeknik> nomagno, in fact this s.o.l.i.d. thing is more palatable when you remove the object-oriented think, and consider that "modification" implies changing the name, which is equivalent to introducing a new function or other (and deprecating/removing the previous)
[01:55:24] <pyzozord> which is what everyone does anyway
[01:55:39] <ProfSimm> Sqaure: the scam here is that you still have reference counting pointers and so on in Rust, and people use them.
[01:55:52] <sonny> Sqaure: I'm interested in language design :D

[01:57:42] <nomagno> pyzozozord: Inversion of control isn't part of SOLID
[01:57:52] <CalimeroTeknik> this s.o.l.i.d. thing seems to me like somebody took things that, used in a certain way do help, but are presented in a way that doesn't help much
[01:57:54] <Sqaure> pyzozord, buzzwords have many names
[01:58:07] <pyzozord> nomagno: lol pyzozozozozord
[01:58:16] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: dependency inversion means "depend on interface" and inversion of control means "depend on parameters"
[01:58:31] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: so, related, but not the same thing
[01:58:41] <sonny> discord? did a rewrite because they couldn't manage the GO gc on the server or something

[01:59:29] <sonny> but some other company just tuned their application instead of a rewrite
[01:59:36] <sonny> worked out either way
[02:00:28] <sonny> it's certainly a community favourite so, it's worth investing in I think
[02:00:56] <nomagno> The 'S' is too situational, the 'O' is reasonable, the 'L' you need fairly abstract languages that are very insanely structurally typed, the 'I' flies in the phase of hierarchical design which is, like, very important, and the 'D' same story
[02:01:04] <Sqaure> IoC is the root to many evils. I feel the issues IoC solves should be solved compile time. Like much of testsuite setup should move to your build. I know most build systems aren't ready for that. "-Hear me now, believe me later".
[02:01:17] <sonny> IoC?
[02:01:23] <nomagno> I don't want Rust to take over honestly
[02:01:39] <Sqaure> sonny, Inversion of Control 
[02:01:40] <sonny> nomagno: probably will
[02:01:41] <ProfSimm> nomagno: the L literally means "type X must act like X"
[02:02:12] <nomagno> ProfSimm: it means 'Type X+Y must act like X when the situation arises'
[02:02:13] <Sqaure> nomagno, what do you not like about it? 
[02:02:16] <ProfSimm> nomagno: also re. I, interfaces don't follow a hierarchy

[03:05:20] <Decker> Recurseecursecur yes - much like python and Go

[03:06:45] <Recurseecursecur> this one points out logical problems in yaml, but doesn't make it clear which one is a bigger nuisance for most people
[03:07:38] <Decker> inability to restream it; having to teach someone else to edit a file and put in spaces specifically is beyond my patience level
[03:08:02] <Decker> it's hard enough to get them to add a comma and a number in the right order
[03:08:16] <FloridaMan> which is easier: that or telling them which brace/bracket to use and where they're missing them?
[03:08:17] <FloridaMan> heh
[03:08:36] <Sqaure> Decker, solution. Only let programmers touch them =D

[05:18:06] <InPhase> flakland: First of all, pretty much everything is twos complement already.  But putting that into the specification does NOT mean the hardware must use it.  It means the compiler must produce code that behaves as if this how the variables work.
[05:18:44] <flakland> i don't know if i can call C a high level language anymore if they ratify this
[05:19:05] <InPhase> You could already compile C onto hardware without integers supported by the processor.
[05:19:47] <MsPoop> InPhase: are you suggesting theres a wave-particle duality principle of software?
[05:19:49] <|smlckz|> given a real number, how can i refer to the part of the number before and after the decimal point?
[05:20:25] <flakland> whole.fraction
[05:20:35] <MsPoop> a hardware-software principle
[05:20:49] <InPhase> |smlckz|: The whole number part is on the left, the fractional part is on the right.
[05:21:02] <MsPoop> chicken and egg problem dude
[05:21:22] <vdamewood> Which do you fry first, the chicken or the egg?
[05:21:30] <MsPoop> software could have very well come before hardware
[05:21:40] <MsPoop> that is just an accidental consequence of history
[05:21:55] <MsPoop> that hardware folk are the 'heros' and happened to create hardware first
[05:21:59] <|smlckz|> now suggest me variable names for both part: would wholepart and fracpart be good enough?
[05:22:02] <MsPoop> or that lead to mainstream software
[05:22:06] <Sqaure> flakland, C high level? Can you get much lower? =D  
[05:22:07] <MsPoop> it could have very much been other way around
[05:22:19] <vdamewood> Sqaure: Yes.
[05:22:20] <MsPoop> and some might argue it surely was
[05:22:41] <InPhase> |smlckz|: Sure.  Or whole_part, frac_part, to make it clear you are not questioning who Lepart is.
[05:22:43] <vdamewood> Sqaure: You can get into actual low-level languages.

[09:01:46] <comet23> it's ironic that a plane ticket to russia, hotels, taxi/transport, hospital stays, and medical treatment is just as good as in america but it's way cheaper than what it would cost to have the same procedures done over here
[09:01:46] <Sqaure> ...or 3 years of dumpster fire 
[09:01:50] <epony> hotels in crisis in NY vs corporations in crisis in DW

[10:07:55] <Jong> Suppose you had two ways to debug. One was more formalized and that formalization was an initial overhead cost. The other was off the cuff debugging by setting breakpoints in vscode
[10:08:40] <Jong> sometimes setting break points and a quick debug is all you need. Other times the problem is so complicated that to keep track of what you're doing, you need a system
[10:09:08] <Jong> like a series a tests to do after every change to make sure nothing breaks 
[10:10:12] <Jong> When you realize you need a system, then it seems the initial attempts of simple debugging was a waste of time

[13:14:36] <Decker> the map tables for physical memory to logical memory have crazy layouts
[13:16:22] <davros_> what is the problem docker solves, how much harder is it to work without it 
[13:16:36] <davros_> just curious where all the peices come from in a project i'm looking at

[13:18:36] <deniska> davros_: while technically not the most correct comparison, imagine docker to be a tool for creating and running single-purpose VMs
[13:18:38] <davros_> this services is gong to be dynamically spinning up instances i guess, thats probably what they want it for

[13:19:35] <davros_> its just i'm wondering about each peice , "why does this exist"

[13:20:14] <davros_> (this was just a utility for managing uploads, they're "rewriting it in rust" to get rid of the npm dependancy)
[13:20:17] <deniska> davros_: docker (well, not docker specifically, but rather "open container format") is used as a foundation for tooling like kubernetes
[13:20:46] <deniska> whether it's a useful tool, depends
[13:21:06] <Decker> it's a modular thing - can build lots of layers in images and stack them together like legos
[13:21:13] <davros_> my game as it stands could run in statically served pages, (single player) , one fly in the ointment being its instantly piratable like that
[13:21:19] <deniska> I personally find docker useful for installing various services which are not my primary focus
[13:21:51] <davros_> these guys are building a service for wasm games and part of the reasoning is games need a server component (even if single player) to stop instant piracy
[13:22:04] <deniska> Like, I will develop with python locally because that's where I have all the tooling set up, but if I need mysql database for testing, I'll put it in docker, because I don't want it installed systemwide on my dev machine
[13:22:06] <davros_> so that people will be motivated to make pro content this awy
[13:22:09] <Decker> starting with a nice base platform, and then layering on peices - you can also drop layers - say you include gcc,make,etc but you don't need that to run, but you can incude that layer, a source layer then do the build in the sysem; and then take that binary output and dorp the other other layers
[13:22:23] <Decker> but I don't know why docker and wasm are related
[13:22:23] <davros_> yeah i was also thinking python is already my goto "utility language"
[13:22:49] <davros_> Decker i've just ended up needing to look at docker , after following suggestions to port my game to run in a browser (wasm)
[13:23:01] <davros_> ^^ for reasons explained earlier: these guys want a server component

[13:23:22] <Decker> sure... then npm is another thing like that - you can use it to install deps, and dorp it in a release
[13:23:45] <davros_> yeah they conceded "imposing npm on people coming from native gamedev isn't going to go down well"
[13:23:54] <Decker> but then I'd encourage going to npm (node) more... which has great websocket libraries
[13:24:05] <deniska> it's not like docker really solves a problem of "imposing npm"
[13:24:09] <davros_> they did a trial run deployment with another chap (C++ based, i'm using rust) , and he complained aswell 
[13:24:12] <deniska> you are just running npm inside docker :)
[13:24:45] <davros_> eventually im sure the service being built can streamline these parts
[13:24:54] <davros_> thats part of the point of it existing (i hope
[13:27:31] <davros_> i am wondering if a bunch of things can be simplified out by virtue of wasm existing, ie. "now you can compile native-like programs on the web"
[13:27:50] <Decker> the interop between wasm and dom is still a JS glue layer
[13:28:04] <Decker> other than for like webgl which needs like a 1 shot glue
[13:28:09] <davros_> yeah thats shitty as far as i can tell but i hope that gets streamlined asell
[13:28:12] <Decker> (and probably still the animate loop)
[13:28:32] <Decker> I don't even really see that remotely possible given the architectures
[13:28:50] <davros_> yeah the port to webgl was a PITA but if i'd read some other docs first about the differences and knew them upfront it would have been easy
[13:28:58] <deniska> wasm is useful if you have heaps of C or C++ code which you want to put on the web
[13:29:04] <deniska> or if you want to use rust :D
[13:29:11] <davros_> which is exactly me
[13:29:18] <davros_> i'm C++ -> Rust
[13:29:59] <Decker> I had a opengl2 layer already and really that just ported pretty quick with I don't even really recall needing changes?
[13:31:57] <davros_> i had a fair amount of changes to make but some was going back on things i'd stripped out, and the real difficulty was finding out performance hazards the hard way ("ah , they can pipeline shader comilation")
[13:31:58] <Decker> just the bit to open the window and swap contexts
[13:32:10] <beaky> nice i like rust in rust i trust
[13:32:17] <davros_> SDL2 + Gl via empscripten , its a great idea imo

[14:44:08] <amigojapan> GeDaMo: yeah, I have tired, that, except that for exaample I tried to add a lable, and i cant seem to get the ui labelModule initialized, something like var lbl = new  labelModule.Lable(); does not work, cause I need to do something like var lableModule = require("ui/lable"); but that does not seem to be working in eval either
[14:44:36] <GeDaMo> Does it throw an error?
[14:44:39] <amigojapan> GeDaMo: it may be an eval scope problem
[14:44:54] <amigojapan> yes GeDaMo, let me see exacly what it sayd one sec
[14:46:33] <GeDaMo> Maybe if you created a global object e.g. myvars then did eval("var myvars.lableModule = ...")

[14:57:36] <thomas25> a device <-> relay server <-> UI. I'd write a single server that that listens on two port and relay the messages. Now, I need to finish a project that never took off and they designed it like this: a device <-> server <-> mongodb <-> server <-> UI. I've contacted the original author and he says it's for scalability reasons they chose micro services instead of a simpler relay server. i just can't rationalize the idea and
[14:57:37] <thomas25>  considering turning to simpler approach. any cons and pros comes to mind?
[15:01:17] <Decker> I'd think there'd still be a hook between servers to post events that records were updated in the database; but maybe mongo has something like that? subscriptions to changes?

[15:06:13] <thomas25> hmm
[15:06:46] <thomas25> also their architecture is designed with devices being master, they decide when to update, they open a tcp connection send stuff or get some new stuff and close the connection.

[15:09:07] <Decker> depends on how many times they connect - a new connection is 3 packets before 1 data... and 2 for close
[15:09:29] <Decker> if it's by name, it's a dns lookup - seems dns results don't have very long keepalives
[15:10:44] <Decker> but - it requires the server to keep receive buffers allocated and sockets and their receive windows...
[15:11:09] <Decker> it is less work for the server - it doesn't have to allocate a socket resource on accept() (and again the TCP window buffer it has)
[15:11:34] <Decker> (to keep the connections open)
[15:12:09] <thomas25> yeah those are valid cons/pros
[15:12:23] <thomas25> less CPU and bandwidth load for server but more memory requirement

[22:45:49] <oldlaptop> KillerWasp: It's a fantastic idea if the kernel doesn't do multithreading properly, or if you don't want the headache of supporting everyone's incompatible threading interface but still want concurrent threads.
[22:45:59] <sonny> just load them on OS threads and have endless fun
[22:46:16] <KillerWasp> It's something new for me, so I don't know how it should work, probably you can't change the uid/gid.
[22:46:53] <oldlaptop> OS threads aren't isolated from each other anyway. They share the same PID and the same memory address space, generally, so of course they also have the same UID and GID (in a unix context).
[22:47:23] <oldlaptop> The main thing you lose is the possibility of true /parallelism/, instead of just plain concurrency.
[22:47:39] <oldlaptop> Multiprocessor machines were way less common when green threads were invented, so that wasn't a big problem back then.
[22:48:30] <oldlaptop> (You can still gain some performance through I/O concurrency - you don't even need the abstraction of threads at all to do that, of course.)

[22:49:04] <GeDaMo> green threads can benefit from multicore too
[22:50:15] <oldlaptop> Certainly in the sense that your green-thread implementation can in principle be smart enough to spin up multiple kernel-level threads to run your green threads.
[22:50:25] <oldlaptop> IIRC solaris once did that at the kernel level.
[22:51:29] <nomagno> Can you actually implement preemptive threading/time sharing in userspace?
[22:51:31] <nomagno> I have no idea how you'd do that
[22:52:17] <oldlaptop> If you're something like the JVM you could, I suppose.
