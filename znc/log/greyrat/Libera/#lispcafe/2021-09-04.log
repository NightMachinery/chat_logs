[01:23:54] <selwyn> well, are there more people trying to cross illegally then usual
[01:24:22] <shka> i mean, it is not like Belarus is a migration route, unlike, let's say turkey
[01:24:34] <selwyn> yes
[01:24:36] <shka> so that's that

[01:24:51] <shka> as for the numbers, few thousands crossed border

[02:11:07] <seere> gilberth: I know. Reducing Germany to Bavaria is typical.
[02:11:21] <selwyn> texas is the common usa analogy to bavaria
[02:11:37] <White_Flame> I think a lot of that has to do with oktoberfest being heavily exported, and people's primary exposure to "german"
[02:12:26] <selwyn> also that the rest of germany doesn't really have a fixed mental image in foreigner's heads, apart from possibly berlin
[02:12:41] <gilberth> seere: Well, I once read the thesis this comes from the US occupying Bavaria after WWII. So this is the picture the soldiers then brought home.
[02:12:43] <White_Flame> or "east germany"
[02:13:03] <selwyn> white_flame: that's true, but in the past of course
[02:13:31] <White_Flame> gilberth: is oktoberfest quite bavarian in its trappings even around non-bavarian germany?
[02:13:46] <selwyn> gilberth: i am not sure, this image exists in the uk as well
[02:13:51] <gilberth> White_Flame: It is very Bavarian.
[02:14:23] <White_Flame> yeah, so the distinctive "german celebration" is as such
[02:14:36] <White_Flame> at least as far as cultural events that non-germans associate with germany
[02:14:38] <seere> White_Flame: deep south? Deep woods with rednecks or westcoast hippies. thats it. maybe bible belt fundamedalists. But were are going political again... 
[02:16:10] <gilberth> White_Flame: Well, that picture of silly music, beer from way too large mugs and funny leather pants is not sth you'll find here.
[02:17:02] <seere> White_Flame: Yes, nowadays it's beer and "Oktoberfest". Literature, music and philosophy is forgotten.
[02:17:41] *** Quits: selwyn (~selwyn@user/selwyn) (Quit: Connection closed)
[02:18:44] <pl> probably doesn't help that germany is stitched from essentially multiple territories that were separate countries with different culture and often language?

[02:18:59] <edgar-rft> seere: don't worry if it's late, gilberth will hate Lederhosn tomorrow, too :-)
[02:19:41] <pl> gilberth: I remember from my visits to Papenburg (Emden) that local Low German is spoken effectively on both sides of dutch/german border
[02:19:52] <seere> we all have our stereotypes bout other nations...
[02:20:17] <gilberth> edgar-rft: Indeed, a pity that I can't vote for the Bavarian separatists.
[02:20:24] <seere> edgar-rft: i don't worry, it's interresting to hear
[02:21:14] <White_Flame> "leather pants" tends to have a different connotation than "lederhosen"
[02:21:30] <gilberth> Or put another way: Bavaria and Austria are culturally way closer than them and me.
[02:21:32] <White_Flame> more of the former, less of the latter, plz thx
[02:21:51] <seere> pl: these are more like ancient dialects.  
[02:22:17] <edgar-rft> gilberth: I would instantly support that :-) Finally something it makes sense to vote for. Good bye Seehofer and Söder...
[02:22:49] <pl> seere: well, locals talked common throat infection with netherlanders, so...
[02:23:19] <gilberth> White_Flame: There are those typical Bavarian short leather pants. But there also are leather pants which look like a vanilla pair of trousers, like say blue jeans.
[02:23:24] <edgar-rft> "Lederhosn" is more the traditional bavarian oldschool-style of leather pants.
[02:24:18] <White_Flame> "leather pants" = https://www.google.com/search?q=leather+pants&source=lnms&tbm=isch
[02:24:32] <gilberth> Yes, and note the missing "e" in "Hosen". That's the Bavarian dialect.
[02:24:37] <White_Flame> ah
[02:25:31] <edgar-rft> motor-cyclists also wear leather pants that have not much to do with what is meant with "Lederhosn"
[02:25:40] <edgar-rft> let me find some pictures...
[02:25:45] <gilberth> edgar-rft: My ex-ex GF had a couple of those regular looking leather pants. Could be quite sexy, if they fit tight.
[02:26:24] <seere> "lederhosn" you where when you go to "oktoberfest" (or are an actor in an 70' softporn). Lether pants you wear when you are a tough guy riding your motorbike ;)
[02:26:57] <seere> s/where/wear/, I shouild go to bead now...
[02:27:13] <White_Flame> typos in typo corrections are always the best
[02:27:46] <edgar-rft> this is how a typical bavarian-style Lederhosn looks like -> https://www.purecostumes.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/FM75785_full_1.jpg
[02:27:47] <gilberth> Yes, and this tough moter cyclist is pretty much the anti-oktoberfest visitor.
[02:27:53] <seere> White_Flame: ´did i mention i should go to bed ;) Having a tough da...
[02:28:17] <gilberth> edgar-rft: Thanks, I have eye cancer now.
[02:28:35] <White_Flame> I guess this is all equivalent to st patricks day and actual irish people
[02:28:56] * seere is riding a motorbike, bit wearing textile. Leather doesn't look goog at me :|
[02:29:02] <White_Flame> just an excuse for people to drink excessive beer
[02:29:03] <edgar-rft> gilberth: I found this image only for you!
[02:29:27] <gilberth> edgar-rft: Terrific!
[02:31:02] <edgar-rft> but it's really worse than reality, even in bavaria people would be emarrassed to run around on the street with such an outfit :-)
[02:31:55] <gilberth> White_Flame: Indeed. Also like carneval in the west of Germany, another custom we don't do up here. Somehow us north germans don't need such excuses.
[02:33:32] <lotuseater> would be cooler to walk in Kimono and japanese sandals
[02:34:08] <seere> gilberth: carneval in the west, oktoberfest in the south. What excuse have the north and the east of the country for excessive drinking?
[02:35:03] <gilberth> seere: As I said, we don't need such excuses, we drink whenever we feel like it ;)

[02:39:41] <gilberth> Heh.
[02:39:58] <lotuseater> yes funny films
[02:39:59] <seere> gilberth: My opinion - after 200-300 km lether gets quit uncomfortable, thats why im wearing textile. Especially on warm and/or rainy days.
[02:40:20] <lotuseater> so those football games happening there I like
[02:40:49] <edgar-rft> no, but seriously, northern people drink more high-percentage hardcore booze, while southern people drink more low-percentage stuff like beer and wine
[02:41:28] <lotuseater> the portion makes it ^^
[02:41:58] <edgar-rft> yes, doesn't mean that you can't get seriosly drunk with beer and wine...
[02:42:03] <gilberth> seere: I have no idea, I don't ride the motor cycle. And never will. But for shoes there is nothing more comfortable than leather.
[02:42:05] <lotuseater> right
[02:43:02] <lotuseater> better riding the car-and-cdr-cycle
[02:43:09] <edgar-rft> gilberth: you don't ride a motor-bike, that's why you need bavarian leather pants

[04:37:49] <hayley> Most intelligent manual memory management fan
[04:41:59] <copec> IMO memory management should be fully controllable, in that the programmer can choose to do it all manually, or depend on a GC they can customize
[04:42:21] <copec> That feels like the CL way to me, since everything else is like maximal amount of choice
[04:43:25] <moon-child> yes.  Manual memory management-styles can be done in a language with automatic memory management, but the opposite is not true
[04:44:46] <moon-child> everybody likes to talk about microcontrollers.  But there's not very much space where you can have 'malloc' and not 'gc'.  Below, there's forth or c with all static buffers and a carefully controlled stack size
[04:45:10] <hayley> IMO C4 in Common Lisp implementation when
[04:45:47] <moon-child> hayley: pls
[04:46:38] <hayley> moon-child: every time you complain we add another barrier
[04:47:45] <copec> I think what I want moon-child is something where I can do what I want to do and not work against the grain. Whether it be chasing down cons or trying to use a library for memory management
[04:50:32] <copec> One could have rust-like memory management, or depend on the GC, or some combination of customizeable behavior
[04:50:44] <hayley> I'm sorta convinced that the read barrier can be speculated/out-of-order executed over without issue, but you still get barriers for manually managed code.
[04:51:10] * hayley uploaded an image: (58KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/XJFXWEazUcihGNGWsdLwNiWA/pauseless.png >
[04:52:18] <moon-child> hayley: well, you also get compaction for manually managed code, so ~fair trade.  Which might be meaningful if you heap is large enough to page and the compactor knows about it
[04:53:10] <hayley> moon-child: Sure. But people complain about it...probably because they see "cache friendly layout" as something garbage collectors don't allow for, and so compaction is redundant to them.
[04:54:09] <hayley> I'm not complaining though, because a struct of arrays or array of structs is necessarily anti-modular as it forces a specific implementation type.
[04:54:13] <copec> hayley: can you link me to something so I'm not supposing what you are talking about?
[04:55:11] <hayley> Something about what?
[04:55:36] <hayley> There's a fair few concepts, and it'd take me a while to go through logs.
[04:56:19] <copec> nvm

[04:59:31] <hayley> FWIW I don't think you get awfully many advantages of manual memory mangement though. Not like you can free() and reuse memory immediately with most collectors.
[04:59:54] <hayley> I suppose your free() could put objects in a list serving as a "cache", and then allocation looks through the cache. But that's pretty silly.
[05:00:23] <moon-child> is it silly?  It's just making your own allocator
[05:01:24] <hayley> Still seems silly to me.
[05:03:00] *** Quits: Qwnavery (~Qwnavery@user/qwnavery) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[05:03:55] <copec> I'm familiar from two sides of it, I read Solaris Internals like 15 years ago, so I know of the slab allocator, which is pretty efficient
[05:04:01] <copec> For its uses
[05:04:05] <copec> http://www.parrot.org/sites/www.parrot.org/files/vmem.pdf
[05:04:07] <gilberth> Most malloc(3) allocators would work with individual free-lists for different sizes. So two objects malloc'ed with different sizes are not next to each other in virtual address space and most likely don't share a cache line. Case closed.
[05:04:32] <copec> Now there is a slab allocator for glibc
[05:05:26] <moon-child> gilberth: have you read the mimalloc paper?
[05:05:52] <moon-child> I think it still uses different lists for different sizes, but it has interesting adjacent things to say
[05:06:25] <gilberth> Cache-wise you can't get better than bumping a pointer and compacting. And in this respect linked list traversal make be cheap. This is why REVERSE usually is more clever than NREVERSE when returning a list gathered in some routine.
[05:07:38] <gilberth> And when you traverse objects while compacting in the same fashion as you bet upon they are accessed later on, you actually optimize cache-behavior while GC.
[05:09:29] <gilberth> moon-child: No I have not. I do not believe in manual memory management at all. It's doomed to fail in every respect.
[05:11:23] <copec> The slab allocator that solaris/linux sorts and recycles by allocation size so it can just hand it over and not do that work again
[05:11:32] <copec> I would imagine a GC implements the same type of thing
[05:11:39] <copec> Or some do
[05:12:15] <gilberth> It's fully that in the 60s people were very well aware of it. It was proposed for CPL even. Then came BCPL. "Na, math is hard, let's go shopping." BCPL was like CPL, but with taking the compiler out of the equation on the ideas (1) The compiler ought to be trivial and (2) the programmer should know what he is doing. Then came B and then C. And here we are.
[05:12:31] <gilberth> * funny
[05:13:17] <gilberth> copec: You pretty much want a compacting GC.
[05:13:19] <copec> Do you understand what I'm thinking gilberth? Or do I need an Elon Musk computer/human interface
[05:14:07] <gilberth> Perhaps, that would almost certainly have a higher bandwidth.
[05:14:14] <copec> I actually haven't had much problem programming non-cons'ing style when I need to, and the GC has been fine in every CL impl that I've used
[05:14:33] <copec> I just think having that portion open and customizable would be the most CL like
[05:14:54] <hayley> gilberth: Would you pay the read barrier?
[05:15:47] <copec> I'm mostly talking to myself ignorantly in here, I need to study GCs
[05:16:02] <copec> Any suggestions where to dip my toes in first?
[05:16:09] <gilberth> copec: Then your problems weren't interesting enough.
[05:16:21] <copec> Indeed.
[05:16:44] <copec> Mine weren't, but I can imagine problems that would be. I just haven't programmed those
[05:16:48] <gilberth> hayley: You will find a decent read barrier implementation anyway, so why pay you for that?
[05:17:20] <moon-child> copec: I seem to recall a nice talk at ismm last? year describing concurrent gc
[05:17:25] <hayley> It's still probably less than 10% slower, which is something.
[05:17:25] <copec> I'm a philosophical programmer, so I'm mostly BS
[05:18:14] <copec> I'll google that up moon-child, thanks

You can't really handle a stack overflow in that kind of system, or an out of memory situation.

[06:47:56] <gilberth> PROG is curious. In the interpreter, the no body-form of a PROG may be a COND. For conditional jumps you would say (GO (COND ((NULL Q) (QUOTE THERE)) (T (QUOTE SOMEWHERE-ELSE)))), the argument of GO is evaluated. Not so in the compiler, where the target of the GO is not evaluated, but COND being allowed as a body form.

[07:12:43] <kakuhen> the 32-bit ARM port wont really help much because ARM changes wildly each revision
[07:13:08] <kakuhen> armv7 and armv8 are basically totally different, and the M1 is based off some superset of armv8a-something
[07:13:28] <kakuhen> i think armv8 chips can emulate armv7, but i havent heard much about it and the details are fuzzy in my head
[07:13:57] <moon-child> kakuhen: it's a three-address risc, how different can it be?

[07:16:02] <kakuhen> I tried looking at the darwin-arm part of CCL and I dont know any comp sci so i dont think i could work on a port
[07:16:06] <kakuhen> also i dont feel like buying any M1 hardware
[07:16:40] <hayley> I can settle for splicing someone to say "Kyle was not with us before...he was not present...now he is dead." Quite easy too.
[07:17:31] <kakuhen> moon-child: just for you to appreciate how "different" older revisions of arm are
[07:17:58] <kakuhen> the darwin-arm32 port of CCL was written before NEON was even an official thing
[07:18:09] <kakuhen> didn't exist on armv6 and it was completely optional on armv7 (and  apparently most ppl opted to not implement it)
[07:18:20] * hayley uploaded an audio file: (151KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/BPaPvQfudkShWhkunDXhSYxP/kyle-is-dead.mp3 >
[07:18:27] <kakuhen> the x86 ports of CCL make heavy use of instructions like SSE2 apparently
[07:18:28] <kakuhen> soooo yeah.
[07:18:41] <moon-child> kakuhen: x86 actually looks pretty much the same with and without sse
[07:18:47] <kakuhen> it's probably not a lot of work to make a bad, unperformant darwin-arm64 port based off the existing arm32 one
[07:18:48] <moon-child> the only place you need it is fp stuff
[07:18:58] <moon-child> (unless you wanna use x87, which--...)
[07:19:08] <kakuhen> but it seems stupidly difficult to make use of all the modern stuff in the m1
[07:20:13] <hayley> I wish they'd not have background music while admitting to child murder, but beggars can't be chosers.
[07:20:15] <hayley> *choosers
[07:21:25] <kakuhen> also the darwin-arm32 stuff is very clearly written with iphone in mind
[07:21:35] <kakuhen> my favorite part: #define MAXIMUM_MAPPABLE_MEMORY (256<<20) /* uh, no */
[07:23:14] <kakuhen> oh also moon-child apparently it's a requirement to have SSE2 if you want to run CCL on x86
[07:23:18] <kakuhen> otherwise it just wont run
[07:23:39] <kakuhen> im not too sure on why this is, or how the x86 port works, but i know that rme worked on it almost entirely by himself, so he can probably tell you why
[07:24:18] <moon-child> probably for floating point
[07:25:51] <kakuhen> oh also the m1 is full of quirks for floating points -- e.g. quadruple precision floats dont exist
[07:26:41] <kakuhen> so if you want something like 80-bit precision, you're just not getting it, not without fighting really hard for it.
[07:27:11] <kakuhen> now im curious on number crunching in SBCL on x86_64 vs arm64
[07:27:33] <moon-child> I question the utility of such high-precision fp.  I think in most cases when 32-bit is not enough, you want variable precision or fixed-point or some such
[07:27:38] <kakuhen> i'd expect the former to win simply because i see lots of random packages introduce x86-specific optimizations to SBCL for this kinda thing
[07:28:51] <kakuhen> moon-child: well, i guess the only issue is for handling long-floats, not that many people would be using them
[07:29:06] <kakuhen> but a quick glance at clhs tells me that you only need *at least* 50 bits precision for them
[07:29:14] <kakuhen> so I guess it's not as big of an issue as i previously thought.
[07:36:07] <hayley> Oh well, I can still get some doctor to call the process "cooking".

Especially the latter, as my primary backend still is Cocoa. The FFI might be a challange as it uses a hacked version of some olde version of GCC to turn header files into an FFI database.

[08:32:49] <kakuhen> gilberth: now that swift has a stable ABI it may be a good idea to start thinking about interfacing with swift too
[08:33:45] <kakuhen> it'll probably be as tricky as the obj-c bridge considering swift's memory management was designed to copy objective-c's (for interopability purposes)
[08:34:17] <kakuhen> well, by "copy" I really mean just copy objecitve-c 2.0 and ARC.
[08:37:14] <gilberth> kakuhen: I will bother when ObjC support is about to be dropped by Apple.
[08:37:24] <kakuhen> so never :3c 
[08:37:55] <kakuhen> apple themselves uses a lot of nice object techniques that cant really done with swift, or at least it is insanely tedious to do so (e.g. isa-swizzling)
[08:38:07] <gilberth> I won't be so sure. Apple is on the route for more lock-in.
[08:38:55] <kakuhen> more lock-in doesn't need removing obj-c support
[08:39:00] <kakuhen> it needs merging the kernel of iOS with that of OS X.

[13:01:23] <pjb> hayley: it depends on whether you have a plank provider, or if you start from trees.  
[13:02:07] <hayley> pjb: I'd imagine you have a plank provider, or at least that the guy in charge of putting the planks up isn't the guy who made the planks.
[13:03:09] <hayley> (I'm asking this stupid question because I am making an analogy for why it is natural most programmers would not care about the source code for one thing in particular. We....don't do everything. No one does everything.)
[13:05:00] <gilberth> I have no need for a sawmill, when I could buy planks at cheaper than cutting them on my own. Especially when I could not use the sawmill all the time and thus would be underutilized.

[13:07:24] <hayley> While I don't care about sawmills, someone does, because wooden beams don't grow on trees.
[13:07:42] <pjb> gilberth: in Europe the woods belong to somebody, and they're cultivated and exploited by commercial interests (and the militaro-industrial complex of the centuries past).   In the USA, there was no such industry, so people had to go cut their own wood to build their houses.

[13:12:05] <gilberth> ok. A closed source OS would be a plank, I can't modify or repair. Even when having all the tools.
[13:12:35] <gilberth> And only drive nails through it at pre-defined placed.

[13:19:12] <gilberth> These real world analogies don't work well because of the zero cost of a copy. And we're not talking about costs here.
[13:19:27] <hayley> Indeed.

[13:22:17] <gilberth> dave0: That's a good example. In ancient times radios and TVs came with schematics, so everyone having the skill could repair it.

[13:48:29] <gilberth> I always wet shave. If that's the term.
[13:49:07] <Qwnavery> gilberth: so what I gather is that they introduced new restrictions on RF devices that require them to be "certified" after a series of tests. Which in a way prevents the open sourcing by placing liability for any misuse of the rf firmware on the manufacturer. Please let me know if I'm wrong.
[13:50:52] <hayley> Surely you can fool proprietary devices into thinking they are in another region, and thus violate RF rules that way.
[13:52:12] <Qwnavery> ^
[13:52:21] <Qwnavery> This whole bill is bullshit.
[13:53:18] <gilberth> Qwnavery: It's (16) in the preamble. "The user, the radio equipment or a third party should only be able to load software into the radio equipment where this does not compromise the subsequent compliance of that radio equipment with the applicable essential requirements."

[13:53:34] <kakuhen> the side effect is that you cannot repair your own video game console
[13:54:20] <pjb> RF rules violations can cost you dearly. The authorities have cars roaming the cities and places with antenae to detect infringements.
[13:54:30] <Qwnavery> gilberth: I see it.
[13:54:55] <Qwnavery> pjb: pretty easy to find offenders aswewll
[13:54:58] <gilberth> Qwnavery: So for a WiFi router which has the HW to use channels not allowed for WiFi here, this means that the manufacturer of the HW must take precautions that the firmware could not be replaced by another.
[13:55:52] <Qwnavery> gilberth: that's stupid, being proprietary someone will find away and it won't get fixed anyway.
[13:56:20] <Qwnavery> This whole bill is just when push comes to shove and the EU ain't having none of it.

[13:58:06] <Qwnavery> they can "lawfully" seize any (and all) online accounts without a warrant or court order.
[13:58:36] <gilberth> And it's not only the manufacturer but anybody importing HW. I doubt that is you, when buying in China. And without a CE sign, you won't get the device though customs. Heck, even a missing user manual in your national language is suffice to not let it into the country. No matter whether you need a user manual or could read the provided one perfectly.

[14:08:58] <Qwnavery> I don't either, but people I live with have it on the TV where I have to walk past to get anywhere in the house, so you pick up the general trends without all the bullshit.
[14:09:00] <gilberth> hayley, better read news once a day and if you only do it in a tl;dr fashion.
[14:10:46] <gilberth> I still don't get where Mr Andrews stands. More leftish or more rightish?
[14:11:10] <Qwnavery> He's like Left Authoritarian.
[14:11:22] <gilberth> ok.
[14:12:06] <Qwnavery> He's completely locked down Victoria in some of the most dictorial ways imaginable.
[14:12:08] <gilberth> Here is me: http://clim.rocks/gilbert/pc.png ;in the lonely quadrant
[14:12:24] <kakuhen> come to calfiornia and you'll get sick and tired of everyone being in that "lonely quadrant" ;)
[14:12:36] <gilberth> Heh.
[14:12:41] <kakuhen> maybe some neckbeard at a university will be in the red or blue quadrants, but theyre the exception, not the rule
[14:12:45] <shka> Qwnavery: AFVs on the streets?
[14:14:02] <hayley> I forgot the meme that says "Fuck off government...oh, if I stay home I get to do drugs and play video games. I'll do it, but not cause you told me to!"
[14:14:11] <Qwnavery> shka: thank god he doesn't have that power
[14:14:30] <gilberth> kakuhen: Nobody in the violet, then?

[14:15:02] <shka> because, shutting down country in most dictatorial ways possible mostly reminds me of this https://dziennikzwiazkowy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2-StanWojenny-768x320.jpg

[14:16:25] <Qwnavery> dave0: holy shit they are actually bumblefucks
[14:16:30] <kakuhen> gilberth: that would be my lonely quadrant :>
[14:16:38] <shka> i would want to complain about military at the border, but i guess i did enough yestertay
[14:16:44] <Qwnavery> gilberth: I haven't done that test in a very long time
[14:16:48] <kakuhen> gilberth: but no, in my experience most people are in the green quadrant
[14:16:56] <Qwnavery> I should do it again.
[14:17:01] <kakuhen> uh let me eyeball some coordinates real quick

[14:17:28] <Qwnavery> shka: damn, poland is a bit scuffed to say the least.
[14:17:30] <kakuhen> most young people in california are within a neighborhood of (-3,-4)
[14:17:41] <hayley> Well, they are not going to be beating my high score of like (-9, -9) or so.
[14:17:48] <kakuhen> older populations will vary somewhere between green and blue quadrants
[14:18:31] <gilberth> kakuhen: If only people would vote that way, and the Green party here is in the red quadrant.
[14:19:15] <gilberth> kakuhen: I personally care way more for the vertical axis than for the horizontal. And besides what is center (left/right) here is left in the US.
[14:19:29] <hayley> There aren't parties past (x, -7) or so. That's the point.
[14:19:36] <kakuhen> oh i misread you gilberth
[14:19:40] <kakuhen> I almost said you reported the opposite of what euros tell me
[14:19:44] <kakuhen> but yes, i agree with your current statement
[14:23:45] <kakuhen> ok out of curiosity i decided to retry the test

[14:25:06] <kakuhen> i hold strong opinions -- they just tend to not be very political ones.
[14:25:23] <gilberth> Heh.
[14:26:00] <kakuhen> my favorite part about the test results page is how the coordinates are specified by GET requests.
[14:26:45] <kakuhen> https://a.uguu.se/KeRNLMDF.png
[14:26:52] <gilberth> Well, and everyone has different things that are important to him. /me for instance can get very angry when civil rights are about to be cut down further.
[14:26:56] <hayley> "You cannot be moral without being religious." I am not a moral person, so how would I know?
[14:27:59] <kakuhen> the (10,10) coordinate reminds me of this meme
[14:28:00] <gilberth> hayley: Indeed. Moral is sticking to a random set of ideas what is right and wrong. Moral is for people afraid of using their brain.
[14:28:03] <kakuhen> https://a.uguu.se/oHCegjjd.png
[14:28:06] <hayley> (-8.88, -8.67)...actually, after like 6 years I don't think I've cracked -9 or further because the questions just make no sense at some point.
[14:28:09] <kakuhen> what makes this especially funny to me is that i know some people like this
[14:28:24] <hayley> Like the "morals" one - I dunno, not relevant to me.
[14:28:47] <hayley> Oh, here is the quarantine meme: https://i.redd.it/7vzx08jxwvt41.jpg
[14:29:01] <kakuhen> oh hey i recognize that flag
[14:29:04] <hayley> gilberth: See https://i.redd.it/0x0ijm9tiz051.png
[14:29:15] <kakuhen> one of my housemates was very into philosophy but i forgot what the name of that blue flag was
[14:29:25] <hayley> Egoism?
[14:29:30] <kakuhen> i just know there's some book "for anarchists, billionaires, and" something i cant remember
[14:29:35] <kakuhen> maybe? it's making neurons fire in my brain.
[14:29:41] *** Quits: dec0d3r (~dec0d3r@2001:8003:4810:9600:7275:1afb:1707:8eaa) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:29:48] <hayley> The Unique and its Property (alternately, The Ego and its Own)?
[14:29:58] <hayley> (Also alternately, the book gilberth still hasn't read?)
[14:30:53] <gilberth> The book gilberth would read in its original version.
[14:32:20] <kakuhen> i only read math books and when i was younger, really stupid light novels
[14:34:25] <gilberth> Somehow I find no patience to actually read these days, but I used to real all sorts of books short of novels. Novels are just entertainment, nothing to learn.
[14:34:42] <kakuhen> for entertainment i read brain dead journalism
[14:34:55] <kakuhen> and sometimes the comment sections, too.
[14:35:23] <Qwnavery> ok I'm done the quiz
[14:35:41] <Qwnavery> (-5.25, -1.44)
[14:36:12] <Qwnavery> It's hard because I'm unsure how to interpret some of the questions because of their possible influence on the results.
[14:36:27] <hayley> IMO the quadrants are a red herring still. And both axes are also prone to multiple interepretations too.
[14:36:40] <kakuhen> there's a new political compass anyway
[14:36:44] <Qwnavery> oh?
[14:36:44] <kakuhen> five values test or whatever it is called.
[14:36:51] <hayley> 8 values?
[14:36:55] <kakuhen> yeah i think?
[14:37:07] <Qwnavery> ya
[14:37:11] <Qwnavery> https://8values.github.io/
[14:37:11] -ixelp- 8values
[14:37:38] <hayley> An example, still: someone who advocates for insulated, tight communities (my ex) and someone who rather wants free association of individuals (me) would both be in the negative y half.
[14:38:18] <gilberth> Well, for a quick test, two axes are fine. In theory you would need as many axes as there are questions.
[14:38:26] <hayley> "Government intervention is a threat to the economy." Hell yeah, I'll take that.
[14:38:51] <Qwnavery> ok doing the 8values and here's an example "Oppression by corporations is more of a concern than oppression by governments." and you have 5 boxes from Strongly agree to strongly disagree
[14:39:15] <kakuhen> i pick the 3rd box assuming it is neutral
[14:39:34] <kakuhen> governments and corporations are sometimes two sides of the same coin to my eye.
[14:39:39] <gilberth> [x] strongly disagree
[14:39:45] <Qwnavery> The problem is if by disagreeing you infer that you believe the opposite than you alter the outcome, it's based on interpretation.
[14:40:03] <gilberth> Sure.
[14:40:08] <hayley> "The general populace is bad at making decisions." I said yes, but I bet it will assume I would rather rule over them, than my interpretation that I would prefer to not be ruled by them.
[14:40:36] <kakuhen> >I bet it will assume I would rather rule over them
[14:40:40] <kakuhen> that is the canonical interpretation yeah
[14:40:41] <Qwnavery> I believe that both of them are a major concern.
[14:41:01] <Qwnavery> kakuhen: kek
[14:41:12] <kakuhen> note that my qualification for canonical is similar to what knuth said about "canonicity" in mathematics
[14:41:21] <kakuhen> if two mathematicians in separate rooms come up with the same example, that example is canonical
[14:41:23] *** Joins: random-nick (~random-ni@87.116.165.220)
[14:41:34] <kakuhen> the test and I both came up with that interpretation independently
[14:41:43] <kakuhen> therefore i see it as the canonical interpretation of the answer's implication
[14:41:50] <Qwnavery> 3x^2 + 8x - 2 is canonical then.
[14:41:55] <Qwnavery> ._.
[14:41:58] <kakuhen> well, what example is it used for?
[14:42:18] <kakuhen> I wish I dealt with nice polynomials like that.
[14:42:28] <kakuhen> I fucking hate whatever the hell polynomials I was given in algebraic geometry.
[14:42:28] <Qwnavery> heh
[14:42:58] <kakuhen> and then my professor thought it'd be real funny to include problems on the exams that were completely out of scope of the course's content
[14:43:05] <Qwnavery> heh
[14:43:10] <gilberth> For each election here is a questionary where you would get a ranked list of parties, which most or least agree with your answers. I took it yesterday. One question was "Do you believe we should exit coal power by 2035 (or what ever)." What was not asked was what the alternative would be and that you don't like nuclear power is somehow implied. Funny that another question was about Nord Stream II. Yet, when we exit coal and don't do nuc
[14:43:22] * hayley uploaded an image: (81KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/AwwOWDIOqhHZgqCHbtoENGwL/astrology-result.png >
[14:43:24] <hayley> Read 'em and weep.
[14:43:26] <gilberth> It's more complicated as simple yes/no answers.
[14:43:59] <kakuhen> there's this proposition that's like: some tangent plane of R[x,y,z]/(x^2+y^2+z^2-1) is not freely generated or whatever, but it follows some formula that is necessary to be freely generated
[14:44:06] <kakuhen> and the actual proof uses methods we never ever learned
[14:44:09] <kakuhen> and this was a first year grad course
[14:44:20] <kakuhen> and literally 5 points on the exam: "is this true or false? lol"
[14:44:30] <Qwnavery> hayley: -9 -9 all right.
[14:44:36] <Qwnavery> lol
[14:44:39] <kakuhen> (oh also the actual proof is like 4 pages long)
[14:44:46] <kakuhen> (and we had  9 other questions)
[14:44:51] <kakuhen> (no idea how we were going to do all of that in an hour)
[14:45:11] <kakuhen> this same professor has done worse stunts before
[14:45:19] <Qwnavery> kakuhen: I haven't done high level maths sadly.
[14:45:26] <kakuhen> when testing people in galois theory, he would make some students derive the actual fucking quartic equation
[14:45:34] <Qwnavery> I get what it's saying but I have no idea where to start for a solution.
[14:45:41] <kakuhen> formula im sorry
[14:45:43] <Qwnavery> Simultanious Equations?
[14:45:49] <kakuhen> he once made a take home exam for his algebra class where manually deriving the entire quartic formula was one (of five) problems, to be turned in within 2 days
[14:45:58] <Qwnavery> get x, solve for y, solve for z using y and x?
[14:46:30] <kakuhen> if you're asking about the tangent plane question it's a lot more subtle
[14:46:32] <hayley> Quartic being y = ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e?
[14:46:34] <Qwnavery> take z and x then solve for y
[14:46:48] <kakuhen> it concerns project modules over some tangent plane of the unit sphere
[14:46:50] <kakuhen> projective*
[14:46:58] <kakuhen> hayley: yes.
[14:47:10] <kakuhen> using galois theory you can derive the quartic formula yourself
[14:47:13] <kakuhen> it's just a fuck ton of busy work.
[14:47:17] <Qwnavery> wait what the fuck
[14:47:20] <kakuhen> not something I'd ever want someone to do.
[14:48:15] <Qwnavery> I never even thought that you could have tangents to entire planes.
[14:48:49] <Qwnavery> then again, what the hell is the cartesian plane, n tangent planes.
[14:48:56] <kakuhen> ok let me clarify this i guess
[14:49:13] <kakuhen> so take R[x,y,z]/(x^2+y^2+z^2-1), i.e. coordinate ring of the unit sphere
[14:49:27] <Qwnavery> ok yep
[14:49:30] <kakuhen> and let A = {(x,y,z)\in that ring above | ax + by + cz = 0}
[14:49:51] <kakuhen> you can prove every A-module is project really neatly, actually, it involves some fiddling with short exact sequences and the fact ax+by+cz=0
[14:50:18] <kakuhen> OH im sorry
[14:50:20] <kakuhen> A is what we call the tangent bundle
[14:50:22] <kakuhen> not the tangent space lol
[14:50:32] <kakuhen> I haven't done a lick of math since I finished my exams in June.
[14:50:40] <kakuhen> I've been stangnating...
[14:50:46] <gilberth> "My religious values ..." My WHAT?
[14:51:16] <kakuhen> anyway it's easy to prove projectivity, but proving the A-module is not free is pretty fking ugly
[14:51:20] <kakuhen> it involves an invocation of Serre-Swan
[14:51:29] <Qwnavery> I see, so ax + by + cz = 0 must be true because of the fact they are tangent, therefore you can solve for a formula in terms of a b and c?
[14:51:31] <hayley> As I was saying about the questions.
[14:51:33] <kakuhen> which is pure abstract nonsense about functors between really stupid topological spaces
[14:52:00] <kakuhen> Qwnavery: in algebra we dont really care about solving anything -- as dumb as this may sound
[14:52:10] <kakuhen> we just care about the structure of the module 
[14:52:42] <Qwnavery> kakuhen: yea, sorry when I say solve I meant re-arrange I guess
[14:53:20] <kakuhen> oh also A is just a definition
[14:53:26] <Qwnavery> I'm like 6 weeks away from my final highschool exams, I know diddly squat about actual mathematics.
[14:53:33] <kakuhen> oh boy
[14:53:42] <kakuhen> yeah this may be too much to explain rn
[14:53:50] <Qwnavery> It does make sense so far though.
[14:53:54] <kakuhen> for some reason i was suspecting you of being an applied math student heh.
[14:54:03] <kakuhen> an undergraduate in particular.
[14:54:31] <kakuhen> aaand i just realized i flooded lispcafe with really off-topic discussion :3c 
[14:54:33] <Qwnavery> Nono, I'm just a measly highschool student who's currently failing all of his math classes because he procrastinates from actually studying.
[14:54:53] <kakuhen> ok before i go to bed i have a funny story about failing all my math classes
[14:55:05] <kakuhen> one of my chinese friends is in that same boat
[14:55:14] <kakuhen> taking linear alg a second time and going to fail because he basically went to zeor lectures and was depressed all quarter
[14:55:20] <kakuhen> he offers me like $200 to do the exam for him
[14:55:31] <kakuhen> he has some disability accomodation thing so i wouldnt be sneaking into some large exam room and meet the prof
[14:55:40] <kakuhen> but I have no idea how the disability center actually operates
[14:55:50] <kakuhen> and I sure as hell do not look like a Yanwen (yes that's this name)
[14:55:57] <Qwnavery> lol
[14:55:57] <kakuhen> so that was a missed opportunity to get $200 
[14:56:02] <Qwnavery> LOL
[14:56:16] <kakuhen> and he failed the class again :<
[14:56:20] <Qwnavery> :<
[14:56:20] <kakuhen> i genuinely wanted to help
[14:56:21] <kakuhen> but whatever
[14:56:43] <Qwnavery> Better him failing than passing without knowing a single thing IMHO
[14:57:10] <kakuhen> he was a CS student but I'm not sure if the stuff he was interested in really needed linear algebra, heh
[14:57:19] <kakuhen> im not sure what exactly he even wants to do
[14:57:28] <kakuhen> i just recall the last thing we did before lockdowns was pretty crazy
[14:57:40] <kakuhen> i had him handcuff me and place me in the back of his old crown vic
[14:57:48] <Qwnavery> what the fu-
[14:57:48] <kakuhen> the dude for some reason has a huge collection of retired CHP vehicles
[14:57:58] <kakuhen> and he has this crown vic with fucking bullet holes on the doors
[14:58:09] <Qwnavery> lol wth
[14:58:09] <kakuhen> its a fun ride every time i get in
[14:58:30] <Qwnavery> heh
[14:58:32] <kakuhen> we would sometimes drive far away and go into hoods and witness all the weird stares we'd get
[14:58:46] <kakuhen> "why is this kid driving a cop car around here?"
[14:58:49] <contrapunctus> "i had him handcuff me and place me in the back of his old crown vic" it's not weird...if you don't kinkshame 😏
[14:59:06] <kakuhen> oh we once got instantly pulled over
[14:59:19] <kakuhen> this same friend loves being inside trunks especially when there's no more seats left in the car
[14:59:24] <Qwnavery> lmao
[14:59:26] <kakuhen> so when we were with his friends
[14:59:29] <contrapunctus> Wow.
[14:59:30] <kakuhen> the dude was just chilling in the trunk
[14:59:33] <kakuhen> there were cop cars behind us
[14:59:34] <shka> crown vic is such a weird car
[14:59:39] <Qwnavery> he sound like loads of fun lmao
[14:59:43] <kakuhen> and my friend likes to randomly jump out of the trunk to startle drivers behind us
[14:59:48] <kakuhen> well, he did it to the fucking university police
[14:59:51] <kakuhen> instantly pulled over.
[14:59:53] <Qwnavery> LMAO
[15:00:26] <kakuhen> gosh -- i had such a wild time at university before lockdowsn.
[15:00:40] <gilberth> Ah, this also is a mere GET. And where are the other four axes?
[15:00:40] <kakuhen> anyway he also got pulled over very often due to, you know, driving a retired CHP vehicle all around.
[15:00:44] <kakuhen> the cops in fact once asked for his number
[15:01:06] <kakuhen> and whenever him and his friends got pulled over -- "oh, it's you guys."
[15:01:23] <kakuhen> we also learned a very dangerous fun fact...
[15:01:29] <kakuhen> the keys on crown vics and explorers are literally identical.
[15:01:36] <Qwnavery> o_o
[15:01:43] <kakuhen> my friend decided to take his crown vic's keys and attempt to open the university police's ford explorer one day
[15:01:48] <Qwnavery> yikes
[15:01:52] <kakuhen> there's this area near a quarry that ppl hang out by and police happened to be there
[15:01:57] <kakuhen> they know my friend and are fine with him
[15:02:02] <kakuhen> anyway they decided to try out the key thing
[15:02:04] <kakuhen> and it actually worked.
[15:02:15] <kakuhen> his crown vic keys successfully unlocked their ford explorers
[15:02:37] <Qwnavery> skeleton key :D
[15:03:15] <Qwnavery> That's pretty sick though
[15:04:07] <kakuhen> sometimes i think about those days and conclude "wow, the people calling me a retard really do have a point."
[15:04:49] <Qwnavery> lmao, at least you're not failing basic HS maths
[15:04:53] <kakuhen> it's getting too late but i also have stories of sneaking into hackathons just to steal google cloud credits and pizza.
[15:05:13] <kakuhen> oh in fact the shirt im wearing right now was stolen at a hackathon
[15:05:20] <kakuhen> it's some XL women's shirt with a fancy graphic on it
[15:05:27] <Qwnavery> lmao
[15:06:31] <Qwnavery> aight, really cool to talk to you, look forward to hearing more stories
[15:06:54] <kakuhen> maybe -- i usually try to not convince people on small, comfortable communities like this one that I'm literally retarded
[15:07:03] <kakuhen> i'm just hyper right now and decided to tell a few of them.
[15:07:26] <Qwnavery> fair
[15:08:16] <Qwnavery> I gotta scoot
[15:08:21] <Qwnavery> peace
