[00:17:27] <kepstin> verify that the disposition option is set correctly, that's needed for some muxers
[00:20:04] <kepstin> i actually suspect that the ogg opus muxing might not support cover art at all? :/
[00:20:22] <baltazar> kepstin: I'm not even converting it or anything, it's literally the same format in and out, just changing the metadata (I have -c copy set)
[00:20:44] <baltazar> kepstin: it does support it, since the source is ogg opus as well
[00:20:52] <baltazar> and it has the cover art
[00:21:43] <kepstin> no, i think the problem is that ffmpeg's ogg opus muxer doesn't support cover art.
[00:21:51] <kepstin> so it's unable to write it to the output file
[00:21:58] <baltazar> ah
[00:22:04] <baltazar> well that's a shame
[00:22:14] <kepstin> which is pretty weird, since it should be the same as ogg vorbis, and i can write cover art to a vorbis file :/
[00:22:33] <kepstin> er, wait, maybe not.
[00:22:50] <kepstin> doesn't seem to work in vorbis either? :/
[00:23:05] <baltazar> I assume that only depends on the container, which is ogg in both cases
[00:23:23] <kepstin> no, it's specified as part of the codec mapping in ogg vorbis and ogg opus
[00:23:35] <kepstin> it just happens that they both encode cover art in basically the same way
[00:23:42] <baltazar> ah
[00:23:55] <kepstin> (the cover art encoding in ogg vorbis and opus is really funky; they make a flac cover art frame, then base64 encode it, then store it as a text metadata param...)
[00:24:37] <baltazar> lol. maybe I should just convert it to something else, not like it matters to keep it in opus
[00:25:19] <kepstin> or use external metadata tools to put the cover art back :/
[00:25:38] <kepstin> copying music file metadata through ffmpeg is already kind of a lossy operation, particularly for multi-value tags
[00:25:57] <baltazar> what's weird though is that I'm pretty sure the source was also created using ffmpeg
[00:26:59] <kepstin> the source might have been originally muxed with ffmpeg, but then had the image added using a music file tagging tool afterwards
[00:27:40] <baltazar> hm
[00:30:34] <kepstin> (i personally prefer to leave my cover art in external files, since duplicating it in every file in an album seems silly, and the vorbiscomment style cover art encoding is really inefficient on top of that)
[00:32:12] <baltazar> kepstin: I usually do that as well, but this is a compilation (my "favourites" folder), and I'd like to have cover art for each track

[19:16:43] <LGPLQuestion> Does LGPL permit me to study ffmpeg and create encoders (not licensed under LGPL or GPL) based on the way ffmpeg uses them?
[19:17:04] <LGPLQuestion> Like learning how ffmpeg using vulkan acceleration
[19:17:36] <LGPLQuestion> and creating my own vulkan accelerated encoder (no copy+paste only follow a spec)
[19:20:34] <JEEB> there is no spec for vulkan usage?
[19:20:42] <JEEB> well there is but more on khronos side
[19:20:50] <LGPLQuestion> Vulkan was just my example
[19:21:04] <LGPLQuestion> I was referring to all hardware encoding setups (NVENC, VAAPI, etc)
[19:21:54] <LGPLQuestion> A better version of my question is: Does LGPL permit me to study ffmpeg as a way to learn how to use libraries ffmpeg uses like VAAPI, Vulkan Video or NVENC
[19:22:23] <JEEB> if you are not utilizing the FFmpeg abstractions I actually don't know how much fun you'll get from the libavcodec AVHWAccel implementations to begin with?
[19:22:57] <LGPLQuestion> My documentation is limited
[19:22:59] <LGPLQuestion> anything helps
[19:23:17] <JEEB> uhh, I thought nvenc|vaapi|DXVA etc have actual examples?
[19:23:33] <JEEB> just like nvidia did the vulkan video dec|enc example
[19:23:57] <JEEB> in general it's a Difficult Question. how much of a derivative work is it if you exactly know how something is done in an open source project
[19:24:13] <LGPLQuestion> I don't want to use ffmpeg as an abstraction layer, just as a method to learn the APIs
[19:24:38] <LGPLQuestion> My final implementation will most likely use very different code
[19:24:40] <JEEB> yes, which is exactly why it's weird why you'd want FFmpeg specifically if you are not going to be using AVFrames, AVCodec etc
[19:24:47] <JEEB> but anyways
[19:24:55] <JEEB> it's a complex thing
[19:25:04] <JEEB> that's why I generally keep away from reading f.ex. GPL code
[19:25:12] <JEEB> if I am implementing LGPL
[19:25:21] *** Joins: gwohl (~gwohl@c-68-52-161-215.hsd1.tn.comcast.net)
[19:25:46] <JEEB> maybe it's overly being cautious
[19:25:46] <LGPLQuestion> I would rather go through ffmpeg's documented code rather than looking through a glorified press prensentation
[19:25:48] <kepstin> this sort of thing is really where you need to talk to an actual lawyer (that you are paying for) if you want a legal opinion.
[19:26:29] <LGPLQuestion> Ok

[19:30:45] <JEEB> I do myself check other implementations after I've gotten something done and if I'm having problems which I cannot figure out (f.ex. quirks of an API or something).
