[00:42:12] <Jaelae> blackfriday screwing me this year
[00:42:35] <arlion> black friday was a week ago?
[00:43:04] <Jaelae> i ordered some things and 3 major items were lost in transit
[00:43:38] <arlion> oh lame
[00:43:54] <Jaelae> Airpods for $79 shipped November 26th, was scanned november 29th and said delivery by Tuesday and ever since then it was never scanned again
[00:43:59] <arlion> maybe your package ended up in a random forest in Alabama
[00:45:00] <DrZak> how are these companies even affording the losses?
[00:45:25] <Jaelae> then Macy's i ordered a Ninja Foodi and it was lost as well
[00:45:39] <sd> 11<H​otmess> they cost $3 to make thats how they abosrb the costs
[00:45:41] <Jaelae> the companies said no problem and they will refund me but then i have to buy the item again at full price 
[00:46:00] <arlion> oof.
[00:46:09] *** Joins: monkey_ (~user@190.104.116.153)
[00:47:54] <arlion> I don't think i would buy the items again and low key wait to see if the packages show up in the next week.
[00:48:02] <arlion> and if they don't show. oh well lol
[00:49:11] <Jaelae>  well they are xmas gifts for people
[00:49:11] <Jaelae> lol
[00:49:22] <Jaelae> though both are easy to get just not as good of a deal
[00:49:38] <arlion> dam. You're right i was just thinking about if it was for me. I'm such a selfish asshole when im drunk
[00:49:39] <Activ8> Black Friday and other deal days are scams
[00:49:44] <Jaelae> you a jerk man
[00:49:52] <Jaelae> some are scams sometimes you find a decent deal
[00:50:02] <Activ8> i have never ordered anything on one of these days
[00:50:38] <Activ8> I tell you why, in the UK what they do is mark down a price but sell it for the same price but say they reduced it when they never.
[00:50:39] <Jaelae> for example the airpods were $129 then for blackfriday $79. then they went back up to $109. however today they are back to $79 for a "extended black friday sale". A month before black friday they were $89. so obviously its a bit of bologne
[00:50:46] <Activ8> I’ve caught many places doing it
[00:50:52] <Jaelae> i got a tv for $750
[00:50:57] <Jaelae> but in september it was on sale for the same price
[00:51:02] <Activ8> Con
[00:51:06] <Jaelae> so they tend to mark the price back up for teh weeks before black friday
[00:51:19] <Activ8> Disgusting behaviour
[00:51:26] <Jaelae> only real good deal i saw was gamestop had Nintendo Switch preowned games - buy 2 and get 1 free
[00:51:55] <arlion> dam that is a good deal. Since nintendo products rarely go on sale.
[00:52:15] <Jaelae> yea exactly. i mean preowned but its fine those cards are pretty solid
[00:52:27] <Jaelae> i sold a lot of my switch games this summer nad couldnt believe how much money i got for them
[00:52:34] <arlion> gotta lick them to ensure they are authentic
[00:52:50] <Jaelae> Mario Kart sells for at least $40+ used
[00:53:25] <arlion> Mario Kart 8 is a8 year old game!!
[00:53:33] <arlion> we need a new MK baaaddd
[00:54:14] <arlion> saying this as a person who enjoyed MK8 thoroughly
[00:54:50] <Activ8> I been playing Zelda OOT today
[00:54:51] <arlion> I really wish they would put the old n64 diddy kong racing on switch.
[00:55:30] <Activ8> I play n64 games on project64 with a genuine n64 controller
[00:55:33] <arlion> Activ8: i played it for a bit and was amazed at how poor the game controllers were. .. well, rather that the controlles didn't map to switch very well
[00:55:49] <arlion> oh then
[00:55:56] <arlion> you're doing the authentic experience
[00:56:04] <Activ8> You don’t play it on the switch emulator you get the genuine 64 rpm n use project 64
[00:56:17] <Activ8> i have a usb to n64 controller adaptor
[00:57:19] <arlion> are you using that project that upscaled all of the art of OOT?
[00:57:58] <sd> 11<H​otmess> ds9 upscaled looks great btw

[01:41:47] <catbeard> to remove the url from referrer and address bar
[01:42:32] <catbeard> it's interesting trying to debug remote image embeds when validating hotlink protection
[01:42:53] <catbeard> you click on open image in new tab and it fails, but then you copy paste the image url into a new tab and VOILA
[01:43:55] <catbeard> i'm not sure how i.wp.com works but could someone potentially sign up under the root domain and gain access to their cdn
[01:44:18] <catbeard> under https://i.wp.com/rootdomain.tld/
[01:44:41] <catbeard> got a webmaster that is seeing images load from there while investigating image theft
[01:44:46] <catbeard> says she never used wordpress.com

[01:48:43] <catbeard> pretty sneaky, but i mean at least the hotlink rules are working
[01:48:50] <catbeard> maybe that's why they had to steal the images again that way
[01:49:13] <catbeard> and code it like that

[08:14:03] <Hunterkll> LOL
[08:14:09] <a1> to rpifan maybe
[08:14:46] <yuken> fuck you laughing at Hunterkll?
[08:14:49] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess but yes, i've noticed a lot that..... linux installers (other OSes too) when they spec minimum system requirements, it's actually a hard deal because the installer does shit in memory that it *expects* at least that much ram to be there or will fail
[08:14:50] <yuken> I can nuke Maryland right now.
[08:14:55] <Hunterkll> so if it cranks to below 4GB 
[08:14:59] <Hunterkll> it damn well may fuck off
[08:15:12] <Hunterkll> Solaris is especially like that because of the CPIO buffer sizes it uses in the installer
[08:15:25] <Hunterkll> you'll get all sorts of nasty p ython errors/crashes/failures if you don't have the minimum amount of ram spec'd for install
[08:15:30] <Hunterkll> post-install you can run with less than a gig no problem
[08:19:12] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess but at any rate, dynamic memory does work in the 20.02 installer

[08:23:46] <d1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many 
[08:23:46] <d1> computer use version of the GNU system every day, without ...
[08:23:46] <d1> ... realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program allocates the machine’s resources to 
[08:23:46] <d1> the other programs that you run. The kernel is an ...
[08:23:46] <d1> ... essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU//Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.

[08:56:08] <Hunterkll> even though kernel debugfs is mounted by default
[08:56:22] <Hunterkll> your 16GB drives might be reporting a hair under actual 16GB then
[08:56:31] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> yea
[08:56:34] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> thats what I expect
[08:56:37] <Hunterkll> kinda like how I have five different vendor 500GB SSDs 
[08:56:44] <Hunterkll> but they all have slightly different usable/reported space
[08:57:13] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> but its such a common occurrence that they should be checking if its larger than, say, 15gb not 16.
[08:57:18] <Hunterkll> it's why i always make sure when RAID-ing SSDs I have them all installed in the final config before building the volume so it uses the size of the smallest reported to make the volume 
[08:57:30] <Hunterkll> yea, but their base OS image may inflate to exactly 16GB 
[08:57:33] <Hunterkll> so then that would fail 
[08:57:48] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> afaik it doesn't
[08:58:02] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> but you make a valid point
[08:58:24] <Hunterkll> that or it's their test scenario for updates/caching/partition layout
[08:58:31] <Hunterkll> so even if it's just partition layout, they may be using fixed minimums
[08:58:33] <Hunterkll> so meh

[15:00:49] <Hunterkll> Haise0: i think blizzard just just hatchet job reductions
[15:00:59] <Hunterkll> like "reduce workforce by 15% " so every team takes a cut equal to that
[15:01:02] <Hunterkll> proportionally
[15:01:21] <Hunterkll> not sure though
[15:01:30] <Hunterkll> i remember one round of layoffs that i am familiar with like every team got hit
[15:01:33] <Hunterkll> regardless of purpose
[15:01:37] <Haise0> could be though I don't see them cutting CoD team cause its their cash cow
[15:01:46] <Hunterkll> LOL
[15:01:53] <Haise0> and they need garbage produced yearly
[15:02:07] <Hunterkll> yea but you can just hire and fire for that shit
[15:02:15] <Haise0> fair enough
[15:03:11] <Hunterkll> apparently a bulk was esports though
[15:03:15] <Hunterkll> which makes sense, honestly
[15:03:30] <Hunterkll> U.S. workers laid off will receive a minimum of 90 days of severance and health benefits for up to a year, according to Bloomberg, and each employee laid off was given $200 in gift cards to Battle.net, which is the company's online video game storefront.
[15:03:49] <Hunterkll> yea that's one thing i can't fault blizzard for - their severances aren't that bad comparatively
[15:04:02] <DrZak> thats so human of them
[15:04:11] <Haise0> lol
[15:05:40] <Haise0> Hunterkll: how far are you with Endwalker MSQs ?
[15:06:03] <Hunterkll> Haise0: Krile gets high as fuck and lost

[15:07:20] <Hunterkll> do you know how hard it is to find a tripping lala in a gigantic ass area without flying?
[15:07:31] <Haise0> wtf lol
[15:14:54] <Haise0> I love playing tank lol, queues are instant for dungeons/raids/bosses 
[15:15:27] <Hunterkll> well
[15:15:29] <Hunterkll> they are.... right now
[15:15:36] <Hunterkll> because the two new classes are healer and DPS classes
[15:15:40] <Hunterkll> wait a few weeks....
[15:15:41] <Hunterkll> :P
[15:15:47] <Hunterkll> healers are facing DPS-level queues right now
[15:16:25] <Hunterkll> DrZak: lol i thi nk with my seniority I get like, 6 weeks of severence in a layoff, and that's it..... 
[15:16:33] <Hunterkll> and that's only because i have more than 5 years tenure
[15:18:56] <DrZak> o.0
[15:19:20] <DrZak> we have 3 months minimum and if you are long enough at a company like me, its 6 months
[15:19:57] <Hunterkll> ah no
[15:19:59] <Hunterkll> it's 5 weeks now
[15:20:09] <Hunterkll> guess that changed at some point in the merger/acquisition shuffle
[15:20:26] <Hunterkll> 5 to 9 years, 5 weeks. 9 to 15 years, 6 weeks
[15:20:47] <Hunterkll> but it's not just a severence package, it could also be a combination "you're still working, but your end date is known" + pay for that period
[15:20:52] <Hunterkll> so you could get notice and them work you all 5 weeks
[15:20:53] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:21:45] <Hunterkll> DrZak: even better, if the company loses the contract and you're kept on with the company acquiring the contract, no severance for you 
[15:21:49] <Hunterkll> since you kept your job
[15:21:53] <Hunterkll> "kept"
[15:22:18] <Hunterkll> and that's if you're "offered" the position to stay on with that contract shifting
[15:22:29] <Hunterkll> so even if you decline because "fuck no i'm never working for them again" etc
[15:22:32] <Hunterkll> you're left high and dry
[15:23:33] <Hunterkll> DrZak: i will say that at least it applies to ALL employees except c-levels, so even division directors, etc 
[15:23:45] <Hunterkll> so unless you're under a negotiated contract for your employment, everyone gets the axe fairly 
[15:23:48] <Hunterkll> so that's at least something
[15:23:58] <Hunterkll> there's no different tier for managers/directors/VPs/etc
[15:24:22] <Hunterkll> Haise0: ayyy i'm inside thancred

[23:17:22] <Telgareith> (in this case)
[23:18:31] <Hempux> Well you could offer their IT guy to trade keys.. "I'll give you my public if you give me your private" and on the interview just pull up your laptop and run the playbook that connects to their on-prem kiosk PCs, installs the hollywood package, kills xserver and starts that instead
[23:18:57] <Telgareith> lmao
[23:19:26] <Telgareith> I'm quitting the place because they can't even get that level of security right
[23:20:17] <Hempux> Do you want to trade keys? I'll give you my rsa_id.pub if i can have your rsa_id.. mine has 4 more characters in the filename so its a pretty good trade.

[23:22:13] <Hempux> I'll do you one better, just send me your RSA token by certfied mail and your credentials and i will do your job for you. you can just look at catpictures all day. Unrelated question. does your PC have russian locale installed?
[23:24:30] <Hempux> I made my very own ansible lookup plugin yesterday to save me the trouble of occantinally spending 2 minutes downloading a CSV file. Once i've used that playbook a couple of hundred times i will have 'recovered' those hours spent.
