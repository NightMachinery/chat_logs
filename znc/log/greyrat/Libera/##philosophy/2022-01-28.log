[00:39:13] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: I don't think I have one
[00:39:16] <mycroftiv> we are collaborating and harmonizing here
[00:39:23] <mycroftiv> profsimm: wow, i totally do, i just manage it
[00:39:32] <mycroftiv> its not much different than a GTA mission really
[00:39:37] <mycroftiv> for me that is
[00:39:48] <mycroftiv> your perceptions, your game, your limits, are probably different
[00:40:04] <mycroftiv> because there are no differences except differences of degree between degrees of difference and no difference
[00:40:13] <mycroftiv> or something along those lines as someone said waking up from ether
[00:40:16] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: do you know how a lazy person is sure they'll get it done tomorrow, and a fat person is sure they'll diet tomorrow. And then they don't. That's the sane person's promise to themselves to be more sane tomorrow.
[00:40:35] <mycroftiv> well if we mean healthy yes
[00:40:43] <mycroftiv> the words all overlap and dance
[00:40:47] <mycroftiv> im listening
[00:41:02] <mycroftiv> ive been heavier and ive been lighter
[00:41:07] <mycroftiv> gone through a lot of alice changes
[00:41:31] <mycroftiv> peacee on phone for a bit
[00:41:56] <ProfSimm> We're subject to our current mindset. If we weren't, there would be no things like bipolar disease. We'd just be static. Decide to think one way and that is it
[00:42:19] <ProfSimm> All atheists pray before they die.
[00:42:34] <ProfSimm> If they survive they are once again atheists.
[00:42:56] <ProfSimm> Continuity is an illusion. We're not ourselves from one moment ago or the next moment.
[00:43:08] <ProfSimm> We're different entities that inherit state
[00:43:24] <iryith> people also sometimes call out for their mothers before they die, even if their mother is dead
[00:43:32] <iryith> doesn't really mean anything
[00:43:39] <iryith> It's a comforting thing
[00:44:28] <ProfSimm> iryith: I'm not sure what you mean by "doens't mean anything". Do the only things that mean anything are when we're comfortable and calm
[00:44:39] <ProfSimm> Life is not determined by those moments
[00:44:53] <ProfSimm> Most people choose to do the minimum in these moments.
[00:44:59] <iryith> no, I'm saying that just because an atheist would pray to god doesn't mean they secretly believe in that god
[00:45:01] <ProfSimm> Believe nothing, do nothing
[00:45:15] <ProfSimm> iryith: I didn't say they 'secretly' believe in God
[00:45:28] <iryith> what was the reason for the comment then?
[00:45:39] <ProfSimm> iryith: I'm just saying you think you don't believe in God, and you don't, and you think you never will, then a moment comes, and you believe and pray. Then you stop believing again
[00:45:54] <ProfSimm> iryith: the point is we don't know ourselves and can't predict ourselves.
[00:46:16] <iryith> like I said, they aren't believing in god at that point
[00:46:16] <ProfSimm> iryith: everyone thinks they'll go into the fire, but until the moment comes, you never know. To quote Tenet
[00:46:32] <ProfSimm> iryith: like I also said, you're missing my point
[00:46:48] <ProfSimm> They truly don't believe in God in one moment, and they truly believe the next moment.
[00:47:09] <iryith> just because they are praying does not mean they believe
[00:47:21] <ProfSimm> iryith: give me a sane reason to pray to nothing
[00:47:28] <iryith> I just told you
[00:47:32] <ProfSimm> No you didn't.
[00:47:47] <ProfSimm> You said it's comforting. What's comforting about praying to something that you believe doesn't exist.
[00:47:54] <iryith> It's a comforting thing. Say you grew up in church as a kid and the act of praying is a comforting activity during that time
[00:48:20] <iryith> you usually revert to something comforting in your past when you're going through an incredibly hard time
[00:48:26] <ProfSimm> I think you interpret it as a regression to childhood memories. It's a valid take, but not the reason this happens most of the time.
[00:48:48] <ProfSimm> I didn't go to church, and there's nothing comforting about prayer, but when I thought I'll die in my life, I prayed
[00:49:24] <iryith> There's a lot that's convoluted in that though. Social norms, media saturation with that exact same scenario
[00:49:38] <ProfSimm> OK, but that's still not the point
[00:50:12] <ProfSimm> The point is most of those people praying, when asked in another time "would you pray if you're about to die", they say 'never'
[00:50:26] <ProfSimm> Therefore you don't control your own programming
[00:51:01] <ProfSimm> This is also why people who try to "change"... they almost never do
[00:51:21] <ProfSimm> Change is mostly things that happen to you, not something you do to yourself
[00:52:22] <ProfSimm> iryith: I wonder why don't we pray to Santa Claus when we die, I mean that's something we universally believed and even saw as children
[00:52:32] <ProfSimm> But that's a side point
[00:52:39] <iryith> because Santa isn't seen as a source of comfort
[00:52:50] <ProfSimm> Shit, Santa is a great source of comfort.
[00:53:14] <ProfSimm> He makes stuff free of charge and gives it to you for being nice.
[00:53:17] <iryith> he's a source of great joy, not comfort
[00:53:29] <iryith> and you never celebrate it with him
[00:53:30] <ProfSimm> How is God a source of comfort/
[00:53:45] <ProfSimm> He's more a source of terror. Follow these laws, and worship me, or hell.
[00:54:01] <ProfSimm> Well I mean abrahamic God I guess
[00:54:06] <ProfSimm> Other Gods have different models
[00:54:25] <mycroftiv> i have to roll. peace and love friend, i will the backscroll in a bit

[02:27:38] <CaCode> ProfSimm, the gravitational pull the effect caused by the large mass of the black hole traps the light but of course it does not act on itself
[02:28:33] <CaCode> the reason the light does not excape is the fact that the gravity does effect the areas beyond the event horizon

[02:30:48] <ProfSimm> CaCode: I see it a bit differently
[02:30:55] <CaCode> ProfSimm, gravity affects mass but not gravity or other forces
[02:32:33] <ProfSimm> CaCode: gravity is an emergent phenomenon that represents the vacuum movement in space. This is not fundamental space, but might as well be the way we see it. Matter "consumes" space, and creates negative pressure in areas of consumption. No matter how fast a black hole consumes, that negative pressure will always travel at light speed outside the black hole and be filled with the surrounding space
[02:33:18] <CaCode> we should test your claim by posting it in ##physics
[02:33:54] <ProfSimm> CaCode: we can't test this claim in physics, because we're still riding the coattails of general relativity
[02:34:25] <krb> i've seen some videos about people talking about how there is no gravity, it's just appears like to us. but according to the video, things go where they will be in the future

[02:35:01] <krb> yeah, it was something like that

[02:35:10] <ProfSimm> time is itself emergent
[02:36:09] <ProfSimm> We need to understand what vacuum is, and we have a very rudimentary idea so far. At least we recognize virtual particles and zero point energy.

[02:40:28] <ProfSimm> What is decaying
[02:40:31] <krb> can we say void of space?
[02:40:46] <krb> or space of space?
[02:40:51] <ProfSimm> krb: vacuum isn't void of space. It is space
[02:42:05] <krb> if by vacuum someone means to say something like a "totally empty location in space, where all we see is a sort of "space itself""
[02:42:31] <CaCode> so what you are talking about is some quantum-term?
[02:42:46] <ProfSimm> krb: but it's not totally empty. It contains at least one field, and is a media for EM and gravity waves among other things, as noted.
[02:43:13] <ProfSimm> Vacuum is lack of anything the way the ocean is lack of anything to a fish.
[02:43:35] <ProfSimm> It's just a naive idea that caused this term that we're now stuck with despite we know better

[02:44:51] <ProfSimm> krb: but be mindful time is not an actual dimension. That's just a human approximation.
[02:44:59] <ProfSimm> Because clocks are useful

[02:46:29] <krb> i imagined that relatively it will go slower higher up (think i got this part wrong somehow)
[02:46:55] <ProfSimm> krb: nah, higher gravity = slower time
[02:47:19] <krb> but since astronauts don't age as fast as we do here. why would we say it was faster time there?
[02:47:21] <ProfSimm> krb: matter basically "eats up time". Think about it as computational density
[02:47:42] <krb> or is it faster only since they move faster around the earth?
[02:47:48] <ProfSimm> krb: they do age faster.

[02:48:17] <ProfSimm> It's not as extreme as it is around stars or black holes
[02:50:06] <krb> maybe it isn't really time going slower at all then for us, it's just the pull making it harder for things to move around
[02:51:02] <ProfSimm> krb: well in a way yes. Time slows down as you move faster and faster, and gravity is essentially identical to constant acceleration

[05:42:25] <ProfSimm> My theory is they're taking it easy as to not introduce cultural shock to us, first, and second not to introduce shock to themselves if we react violently
[05:42:48] <ProfSimm> The default mode of co-existence is the threat model and competition
[05:43:33] <ProfSimm> So it takes a very slow and patient approach to build compatibility between two civilizations so they co-exist peacefully. It's not just a function of "oh they smart, so they good" It's more complex

[06:09:25] <mycroftiv> sufficiently smart civilizations tend to not fight the limits but figure out some kind of end-run around them, and mutual simulation allows for this
[06:10:09] <mycroftiv> so to talk to another alien species that might be about to show up at your doorstep, you simulate it and communicate with the simulation, to hopefully work out a peace treaty before the fleets meet
[06:10:39] <mycroftiv> its much safer to negotiate with a simulated entity in a box that you control than the actual entity
[06:11:30] <mycroftiv> but a simulation that is worth talking to about its goals is going to need feelings in the simulation to motivate those goals
[06:12:26] <mycroftiv> and so the process of civilizations simulating each other is probably infinite nesting boxes, with each layer a little simpler relative to the metalayer
[06:13:16] <mycroftiv> if you have a Sufficiently Safe Simulated Society Simulacrum you can open the Pandora Box and let it out into the higher reality
[06:14:09] <mycroftiv> interestingly the easiest way to measure the safety is by studying how the simulation treats its inner models, if it shows compassion and mercy and kindness
[06:15:18] <mycroftiv> this isnt much different than the law of karma or various mathematical/physical symmetry and equivalence principles
[06:15:54] <mycroftiv> the best simulations and the best realities tend to converge into the same ontology
[06:16:19] <mycroftiv> and hence good dreams can become real in many universes, with decent statistical likelihood in the big Measure
[06:17:26] <mycroftiv> believing in the good dream possibilities is like a cybernetic feedback loop where the optimization oscillation of sympathetic vibrations finds the sweetest harmonies that perpetually rainbow and shadow and crystal in the painting

[10:05:12] <Jong> Do you guys think it's inevitable that philosophy will be a regular required course in k-12 grade the same way math and science are now?
[10:05:31] <mycroftiv> probably yes
[10:05:34] <Jong> I can't imagine that in 500 years, still philosophy won't be required
[10:05:49] <mycroftiv> i think the idea of 'requirements' may change a lot way before then
[10:05:57] <mycroftiv> in just a few weeks honestly
[10:06:11] <Jong> true. The education system as we know it won't exist 500 years from now
[10:06:26] <mycroftiv> the whole post-corona landscape of a lot of things is going to be different i think, nice and soon
[10:06:52] <mycroftiv> ive been starting to say we can kind of all agree that Feb 15 has a good chance of being a kinda Good Day
[10:07:17] <mycroftiv> i mean they are all good days
[10:07:23] <mycroftiv> for someone somewhere at least!
[10:07:30] <Jong> no philosophy in k-12 -> overall uninstall society -> cannot be an advanced society.   The contrapositive is: is advanced society -> overall intelligent -> people must learn philosophy
[10:07:42] <Jong> s/uninstall/unintelligent
[10:07:42] <ro-bot-o> Jong meant to say: no philosophy in k-12 -> overall unintelligent society -> cannot be an advanced society.   The contrapositive is: is advanced society -> overall intelligent -> people must learn philosophy
[10:07:48] <mycroftiv> and if its just not your day - well every dog has one, and the cats and dogs eventually sort out their boundaries maybe

[10:17:42] <Jong> One area I find people weak in because they haven't studied philosophy is regarding words. Philosophers are good at identifying the idea a word represents in a given discussion and if the word is unpinned and pinned to new idea at any time, the philosopher detects the equivocation.  But most people don't
[10:23:21] <mycroftiv> learning the flexibility of language and symbols, the softness, is a new vibe perhaps we can all groove with. i must travel for a bit. thanks for speaking with me. see you soon perhaps.

[18:03:12] <amigojapan> zicada: even the monalisa is overrated so I say it is not "objectively good" as many people claim
[18:10:42] <zicada> it would be foolish to claim any piece of art is objectively good
[18:10:46] <zicada> imho
[18:28:38] <iryith> you could say it is objectively technically well done
[18:28:43] <iryith> so, technically good
[18:29:05] <mycroftiv> zicada: i was just trying to be a little clever. beauty is in the eye of the beholder and art is communication, so to me the Quality is in the interaction. altho some art is just fun for the creator and is only seen by them, still same thing

[18:38:49] <zicada> iryith: right, but only if its a figurative painting
[18:39:08] <zicada> iryith: you could say its objectively well painted, application of technique 9/10 say
[18:39:24] <iryith> not necessarily, y ou can probably pick apart any piece of art down to technical specificities
[18:39:37] <iryith> Even abstract art
[18:39:40] <zicada> and that IS the content. This is where I feel the split is. Some argue "therefore figurative art is wrong/bad"
[18:39:45] <iryith> lots of interesting color blending and chemistry going on in there
[18:40:09] <zicada> becasue the art has a preconceived notion of what it is, instead of abstract, where the veiwer gets to decide entirely"
[18:40:21] <mycroftiv> cant that go both ways in both cases?
[18:40:50] <mycroftiv> as a viewer, i can look at representational art 'abstractly' as pure geometry and color without reference to an external model, if i wish
[18:41:13] <mycroftiv> and almost all purely abstract art can look a bit like something, in some cloud-face vague way if you squint
[18:41:13] <zicada> if its a picture of a landscape with a person on a horse
[18:41:15] <zicada> then thats what it is
[18:41:35] <zicada> it could be anyone, but often its a particular person at a parcilar person in time etc
[18:41:40] *** Quits: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.helmsley.irccloud.com) ()
[18:42:17] <zicada> for some art critics this is problematic, that the artist has "too much say" in a way, with a figurative work
[18:42:43] <mycroftiv> zicada: the 'thats what it is' is still a perceptual bind happening in the perceiver, there are measurable correlations between a representational painting and its topic, but double-images and illusions and infinite flex exist
[18:42:54] <zicada> and they end up thinking abstract art therefore is more "true" art, because it has nothing subjective, and anyone can look at it and only use their own experience to define what its about
[18:43:06] <zicada> whereas with figurative paintings you expect the viewer to know what you do
[18:43:17] <mycroftiv> its the common knowledge indeed
[18:43:49] <mycroftiv> although abstract art often evolves its own language, which may not be referential to physical shape, but can still carry external meaning perhaps
[18:43:50] <zicada> because it has nothing but "the subjective" i meant
[18:44:13] <zicada> there is no lingering objective fact that the author has left behind, that will hit you differently based on your own culture
[18:44:46] <zicada> thats where they get the idea that some art is "racist" because it demands the viewer has the same culture as the painter in order to understand the painters "true intention"
[18:45:12] <zicada> but with abstract painting that cant happen, it doesnt required any particular culture etc
[18:45:18] <zicada> its just patterns, so its...  safer ?
[18:45:20] <mycroftiv> yea but maybe sometimes painting just wormhole to a different universe and the person-on-horse is just as abstract to 17dimensional beings as any other image of something with no correlate in their reality
[18:45:43] <zicada> art should not try to "feel safe" i think
[18:45:53] <zicada> seems to defeat a lot of the purpose
[18:45:59] <mycroftiv> some art is a tool of revolutionary change
[18:46:11] <zicada> mycroftiv: sure
[18:46:15] <zicada> propaganda
[18:46:30] <mycroftiv> theres a beautiful sculpture with a sign in my city just in front of a random house "art is not a mirror held up to reality but a tool to shape it" - or about like that
[18:46:39] <zicada> and art from people who are moved by said propaganda, like 2nd rate propaganda i guess
[18:46:55] <zicada> but theres a while dynamics, a range there
[18:47:02] <zicada> whole*
[18:47:11] <zicada> all art is more or less political
[18:47:13] <mycroftiv> art, advertisement, propaganda, literature - a lot of labels with value systems that are observer-relative frames
[18:47:40] <zicada> mycroftiv: neat, which city ?
[18:47:50] <mycroftiv> zicada: Madison, Wisconsin
[18:48:04] <mycroftiv> (united states of america, planet earth, etc)

[18:50:48] <zicada> last names are pretty modern

[18:52:05] <mycroftiv> some amazing algorithm where the compression happens outside instead of inside, if that makes sense to some of you
[18:52:23] <zicada> but if you happened to be a smith, then people would call you your name Smith

[18:52:39] <mycroftiv> and if you make funny jokes
[18:52:40] <ProfSimm> Most categories we deal with are defined by positive examples, negative examples (is or isn't the category) and there are always fuzzy items in the middle that people on the internet argue bitterly in which category they fall.
[18:52:54] <ProfSimm> What does that say about our thought process.

[18:53:40] <ProfSimm> But we also define our own 'universes', and in there categories are absolute. Format models.
[18:53:42] <mycroftiv> all the senses are involved, everything in proportion, timing and balance, ritual and renewal, its a lovely case study
[18:53:52] <mycroftiv> profsimm: format, or formal, or both?
[18:53:54] <ProfSimm> We can definitively say if a point is in a circle or outside
[18:53:58] <ProfSimm> formal*
[18:54:15] <mycroftiv> i think format is fine too, the letter itself can be in a kind of unstable perceptual superposition of states
[18:54:48] <mycroftiv> where we hear a primary meaning and an 'echo' meaning or something, and this happens in language just as it goes and flows anyway, on the larger level, so projecting it into letters is same theme. unicode i suppose
[18:54:56] <ProfSimm> So are fuzzy categories an artifact of our imperfect mapping from mental model to reality, and does that mean reality has its own absolute categories in the model it represents

[19:00:56] <mycroftiv> the open spinning balance is kind of the alchemical secret obviously
[19:00:58] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: what i can't understand about namespaces is this... if I copy a folder that's mounted to another folder, am I copying the mount, or the contents of the mount. And am I copying it for the process only, or on the disk for all

[19:01:18] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: how does plan 9 mix all these things together. Categories :) in its own little universe
[19:01:18] <zicada> mycroftiv: its like a game, how much have you forogtten when you have kids that age yourself, say. It really is right to way forgotten becasue you know a lot MORE Than the teens do at this point right
[19:01:23] <mycroftiv> profsimm: with languages, the thing and the thing-pointed-to have a way of telescoping
[19:01:36] <mycroftiv> its a homotopy thing, if that language is ok with you, the math part
[19:01:47] <mycroftiv> i never want to force the math or anything
[19:02:01] <mycroftiv> forcing is supposed to be by choice. mathematically speaking.

[19:05:44] <ProfSimm> There you go. Imagine URLs are files and folders and that's plan 9 ;-)

[19:05:56] <zicada> im realatively familiar with how nix kernels are structured
[19:06:07] <zicada> yeah its kinda REST like i suppose you could say kinda ish
[19:06:20] <ProfSimm> I'm a sucker for "one abstraction to rule them all" concepts

[19:07:55] <zicada> its not stateless in the way REST is anyway
[19:07:55] <ProfSimm> zicada: in plan 9 it's all centered around file system mounts.
[19:08:16] <ProfSimm> zicada: you know how linux/unix have this /proc directory, it's modeled after plan 9. Plan 9 models everything like virtual folders.
[19:08:23] <zicada> not sure what you mean by mounts
[19:08:36] <zicada> you could arguably say everything in every NIX is a file
[19:08:44] <ProfSimm> zicada: well you have device like a usb stick, you mount it to a folder right
[19:08:46] <zicada> does it matter that its "mounted" it exists in the filesystem
[19:08:48] <zicada> when you boot
[19:09:07] <zicada> things like /dev being all the devices and /proc being all the processes etc, theyre files
[19:09:15] <ProfSimm> zicada: well in plan 9, however one distinction is the mounts are process-specific, not global.
[19:09:26] <ProfSimm> zicada: so it's not all at boot time
[19:10:02] <zicada> ProfSimm: so each individual file is owned by some process, not just a mamber of a group of precesses
[19:10:06] <zicada> member
[19:10:29] <ProfSimm> Not each file, more like each mount, a sub-tree of the file system
[19:10:41] <zicada> ProfSimm: so must be lots of "handover" going on ? lots of making sure all files are owned by somebody etc
[19:10:41] <ProfSimm> A mount is more like a directory and everything under it
[19:10:46] <zicada> what are the upsides ?
[19:11:08] <ProfSimm> zicada: I have to defer to mycroftiv if there's a loft of handover, but I don't think so.
[19:11:11] <zicada> i mean i havent heard of it and its from the 80s, its logical to conculde the upsides were not enough to outweight he downsides
[19:11:17] <zicada> or it would be a thing now
[19:11:58] <zicada> what are we missing out on with modern Linux that Cloud 9 would have given us, that we need now
[19:11:58] <ProfSimm> zicada: the problem is that elegance and correctness are not criteria for surviving natural selection on their own.
[19:12:14] <zicada> word
[19:12:23] <zicada> elegance is a human concept
[19:12:43] <zicada> theres no reason to think reality is "elegant" according to current cultural human ideals about what that is
[19:12:43] <ProfSimm> zicada: modern Linux has a lot of ad-hoc APIs for the same thing, where you need to write dedicated programs to connect them, which in plan 9 would be a single CLI shell command.
[19:12:57] <Atque> zicada: so are programming and operating systems : P
[19:13:13] <ProfSimm> zicada: for example in plan 9 your sound device is a file. You share it on the network, someone else can mount it, and pipe their sound to your computer. No programming needed
[19:13:13] <zicada> to even think reality is somethinhg humanity can recognize is hubris
[19:13:42] <zicada> Atque: indeed
[19:13:53] <zicada> ProfSimm: your sound device is a file in linux too
[19:14:11] <ProfSimm> zicada: right but what can you do wijth it
[19:14:24] <zicada> you directly change that file to make sound come out
[19:14:31] <zicada> if you want
[19:14:38] <ProfSimm> Can you share it on the network
[19:14:51] <zicada> and the underlying layer decides which driver to use to make that file appear
[19:15:10] <zicada> its a file
[19:15:28] <ProfSimm> yes it's a file, but can I pipe sound over the network to it
[19:15:34] <zicada> nix is famous for "everything is a file"
[19:15:50] <ProfSimm> Basically Linux/BSD/Unix have since borrowed a lot from Plan 9, but in a fragmented way
[19:15:55] <Atque> ProfSimm: Lol
[19:15:55] <ProfSimm> So it's not the same thing
[19:15:56] <zicada> im sure
[19:15:58] <zicada> thats great!
[19:16:10] <zicada> early stories of what we'd call opensource today
[19:16:10] <Atque> ProfSimm: Yea, you could share it on the network but... don't
[19:16:21] <mycroftiv> sorry i wandered off a bit to a different stream but im floating back
[19:16:23] <zicada> what we all want is good software after all
[19:16:31] <ProfSimm> Atque: well the point is in plan 9 that's business as usual
[19:16:38] <zicada> MUST it be some cool sub-thing that the majority doesnt use ?
[19:16:50] <zicada> in order to be cool ? or can we get past this after 35
[19:16:52] <Atque> ProfSimm: what kind of environment requires that to be BAU?
[19:17:08] <ProfSimm> Atque: BAU?
[19:17:16] <Atque> business as usual?
[19:17:17] <zicada> like how the "cool coders" HAVE to use postgre, because mysql is so mainstream etc
[19:17:29] <zicada> its identity over utility
[19:17:34] <zicada> dumb imho
[19:17:44] <ProfSimm> Atque: I don't understand your question. Have you sometimes wanted to share sound from your iPhone to your speakers :P?
[19:18:10] <mycroftiv> you need sharing and security both
[19:18:29] <mycroftiv> and know when you want a lossy or lossless channel , what encoding, encrypted or not
[19:18:41] <Atque> Yeah, but they don't it by piping data directly to device handler.
[19:18:42] <mycroftiv> how we connect the data paths is an infinite weaving art
[19:18:51] <zicada> young coders have a strong need to signal that the tools and techs they use are the coolest and best, and that people who use other techs and tools are dumb
[19:18:52] <mycroftiv> sometimes you go in raw
[19:18:55] <ProfSimm> zicada: if I can sum up plan 9, it's like imagine all the APIs of it are like a single USB type port. And Linux is all.. parallel ports, serial ports, thunderbolt, mini display port... etc. etc.
[19:18:57] <zicada> eg vi vs emacs
[19:19:00] <zicada> and such
[19:19:11] <Atque> Heck, iOS runs Darwin. It has /dev too, but you still have APIs and all that layered on top.
[19:19:13] <ProfSimm> It's fragmented
[19:19:33] <zicada> ProfSimm: meh
[19:19:42] <zicada> ProfSimm: you dont seem to understand Plan 9 that well
[19:20:09] <zicada> lets just accept theres is a reason its not with us anymore
[19:20:16] <zicada> other technologies turned out to be better
[19:20:25] <zicada> and caught on, not always because they were better either mind you
[19:20:31] <ProfSimm> zicada: you were asking a moment ago if I mean the movie, but I guess since then you've rapidly advanced in understanding Plan 9
[19:20:39] <mycroftiv> when you say not with us any more that seems kinda funny because im here inside plan 9
[19:20:48] <zicada> right now, Linux is what gets the most development, its interesting enough
[19:20:55] <zicada> and arcane enough in places
[19:21:13] <mycroftiv> ive been using and living inside plan 9 for a long time, i connect to and use standard systems also, in my weird house of cables and cords, but plan 9 is kind of at the center
[19:21:13] <Atque> zicada: Yeah, so most OSes can only have so many file descriptors.
[19:21:37] <ProfSimm> zicada: assuming "there's a reason" and dismissing it, is in fact the reason it was dismissed.
[19:21:39] <pussipupu> The is-an-object paradigm feels nicer than is-a-file
[19:21:41] <ProfSimm> zicada: network effects
[19:21:47] <Atque> I imagine right now, there's a few hundred network connections. Storing those all as file descriptors doesn't seem sensible.
[19:21:50] <ProfSimm> zicada: there's no other reason
[19:21:53] <zicada> ProfSimm: yeah, im aware of many failed unix projects from the 80s that tried to invent things. Many of those ideas were redefined and improved and went towards projects exactly like Linux
[19:22:24] <ProfSimm> zicada: Linux doesn't have an "improved" idea of what Plan 9 did
[19:22:39] <zicada> but the GNU people clearly felt cheated, that Linux got all the credit
[19:22:55] <zicada> when he only did the kernel and they did all the tooling almost
[19:22:58] <Atque> zicada: Some get new life too. Functional programming mirrored maths in PROLOG, LISP etc. Those never succeeded. Now, Scala, F#, Rust etc. all like the style.
[19:23:03] <zicada> and the clib and stuff
[19:23:41] <zicada> Atque: For sure. Lovely changes in the ES-spec for js
[19:23:48] <zicada> benefited everyone
[19:25:06] <zicada> but like with movements elsewhere, hardline groups are created etc
[19:25:23] <zicada> who will never accept over their DEAD BODY that VI is anywhere close to Emacs etc
[19:25:56] <zicada> just as an example, endless array of things to argue about
[19:26:01] <ProfSimm> zicada: whether a project succeeds or not is a function of thousands of parameters. What plan 9 will be reinvented eventually but it can take arbitrarily long
[19:26:02] <Atque> Is visual studio code acceptable over vi and emacs?
[19:26:29] <zicada> Atque: i use vscode every day and i think its the best IDE i have ever used
[19:26:33] <zicada> i love it
[19:26:43] <Atque> ProfSimm: Why would it be reinvented?
[19:27:07] <Atque> zicada: Yup, same
[19:27:38] <zicada> it opens instantly, i can have 5 of them open at once with tons of tabs open and all i have to do is pay a 50 bucks for 64GB ram
[19:27:53] <zicada> people complain about Electron ? Its amazingly fast on my Ubuntu machine
[19:28:14] <zicada> worth some extra ram imho
[19:29:13] <Atque> Yeah, I need to build a pc pc some time this year. I have got it on my mac and work laptop. Even with lower specs it works well tbh.
[19:29:41] <Atque> pc pcs are kind of making me sad at the moment, because GPUs are still way too expensive.
[19:30:23] <ProfSimm> Atque: the problem of modern APIs is fragmentation. Eventually the drawbacks of ad-hoc APIs outweigh the benefits and a unified concept takes over.
[19:31:12] <mycroftiv> unification and diversity can balance in code and life
[19:34:01] <Atque> ProfSimm: Well, the common runtimes for people today are very varied... the web, JVM, CLI, Python, Node, iOS, Android, macOS, container environments (podman/docker/etc.), cloud, linux etc., even excluding niche ones.
[19:34:36] <Atque> ProfSimm: Unless some government steps in and forces everyone to move somewhere, I imagine it would grow and grow for a long time.
[19:35:39] <ProfSimm> Atque: actually what docker does in part reinvents Plan 9
[19:35:54] <ProfSimm> Atque: virtualization is much more trivial under plan 9, it's part of the kernel
[19:36:07] <mycroftiv> its a little more complicated and abstract than that id say
[19:36:37] <mycroftiv> namespaces arent really quite the same as virtualization, although very similar, and what is literal and what is metaphor can be tricky to be precise about
[19:36:58] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: if you mount things per process, that process can be isolated.
[19:37:11] <ProfSimm> And all APIs and devices are namespaces so
[19:37:28] <Atque> ProfSimm: Docker doesn't provide virtualisation. That is done through hypervisors, virtual machines etc. It provides tooling for specifying how to build containers and other things like docker compose for multicontainer interactions, dockerhub for storing images etc.
[19:37:34] <mycroftiv> profsimm: yes, i do plan 9 really obsessively for many years so lets talk details to clear up any confusion if youd like. its very cool stuff :)
[19:37:57] <mycroftiv> the per process sandboxing in 9 is not the most developed mechanism from a security viewpoint
[19:38:10] <ProfSimm> Atque: well it doesn't matter what we call it. Point is every process exists in its own environment that can be customized for it
[19:38:27] <mycroftiv> the plan 9 parallel namespacing works less as a security lock-in jail, and more as giving each process its own little garden
[19:38:51] <Atque> ProfSimm: Is that a good idea? It sounds like it would introduce overhead where not needed.
[19:39:14] <ProfSimm> Atque: "overhead" is not something anyone ever said for plan 9
[19:39:24] <Atque> Heck, in Windows 11, app virtualisation is said to reduce GPU performance by 20% in some cases. Imagine the impact of doing that for each process.
[19:39:45] <ProfSimm> Atque: how is it less overhead to literally reinvent poorly some of the same idea on top of a kernel that can't handle it
[19:40:45] <ProfSimm> Atque: all plan 9 does is avoid "global state by default". There are global mounts, but you decide which are and aren;t
[19:40:54] <Atque> ProfSimm: Is it less overhead to rebuild everything depending on the NT kernel and Windows platform from the last 30 years? No
[19:41:10] <ProfSimm> Atque: I don't understand your point
[19:41:43] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: do you feel the overhead of plan 9 ;-)
[19:41:48] <Atque> There are plenty of good kernels (zirkon, linux etc.). But it doesn't make sense practically to migrated to them in many cases.
[19:42:26] <ProfSimm> Atque: you're talking about inertia and network effects, while trying to argue about overhead of implementation. I don't think these connect
[19:42:51] <ProfSimm> Atque: it's self-evident the world is not running on plan 9. Yes network effects are most of it. Overhead isn't
[19:43:18] <ProfSimm> Network effects are often the opposite of quality
[19:43:31] <ProfSimm> Let's say inversely correlated
[19:44:38] <ProfSimm> Windows is one example, and I'm using Windows.

[22:24:21] <mycroftiv> Ok. Shall I attempt to perform a more rigorous and careful test of my manual typing and grammatical construction skills?
[22:24:28] <iryith> no
[22:25:01] <iryith> It's like being the only sober one at a frat party. People slurring their speech and thinking it is making sense to everyone else, and everyone else accepting it because they're drunk as well and it's just random nonsense
[22:25:04] <mycroftiv> I have damaged fingers from rheumatoid arthritis and I am indeed on some marijuania which I believe is medicinal, but I don't think I'm below human sober average for verbal communication right now.

[22:26:05] <mycroftiv> iryith: That is a fair and honest assessment. I have used weed my whole adult life and I did probably start too early as a teen./
[22:26:35] <mycroftiv> I certainly cannot claim that the ratios of smoking weed and playing videogames to doing more conventionally useful tasks in my life has been optimized.
[22:27:04] <mycroftiv> However, I don't believe the societal treatment of drugs and medicines and plants such as cannabis has been optimal at all either, so I'd like to ask for a treaty in an ongoing war.

[22:27:40] <mycroftiv> I apologize if, like many veterans, I have a few screws loose from days fighting on the front lines and seeing my buddies go down in the dirt. Literally, with an angry cop doing so because of a plant.
[22:27:45] <mycroftiv> Now I do understand the flipside
[22:28:04] <mycroftiv> If we want to look at really specific history, there was Weedstock and there still is Harvest Fest
[22:28:56] <mycroftiv> Weedstock was organized by some people that im a few people away from, a kind of music and marijuania and farm hippies kind of anarchically making a mixture of protest and party
[22:29:09] <mycroftiv> had some good and bad aspects like all of life
[22:29:55] <mycroftiv> but overall the idea of going to some open land, setting up some speakers, letting whoever voluntary chooses to go to that land enjoy music and the headspace they create with plants - well overall it seemed like a good time
[22:30:03] <mycroftiv> now the causalties are real, of all the partying
[22:30:29] <mycroftiv> and in fact, the actual facts of my life and all this is pretty public, me, JenBen Kidwell, and my friends and associates and history
[22:30:46] <mycroftiv> I can talk honestly about who did too much when and how it hurt themselves and someone else and it was not cool

[22:31:20] <mycroftiv> relapses and jail terms and well-intentioned attempts to 'help' by people who were close and maybe were harming even by attempting to help
[22:31:47] <mycroftiv> I talk a lot about Choice and drugs and addictions are some of the craziest paradoxes of choice-not-choice

[22:32:35] <mycroftiv> for both the patient, and whatever the molecules in question are
[22:32:55] <mycroftiv> these molecules that may bring us either healing or harm, we study them scientifically and rationally, but we also study them via long term cultural practice

[22:33:34] <mycroftiv> it is not secret at all that the use of substances to alter consciousness seems to be part of many religious practices, and anyone who has opened the Doors of Perception understands why
[22:34:14] <mycroftiv> in the 1950s in the usa, some conservative people thought LSD and related were 'proof of god' because seemingly -cough- sober people would take them, and have indescribable experiences, and come back slightly...Changed.
[22:35:04] <mycroftiv> after a few hours they saw the world without the wild colors and streaks and kaleidoscopic spirals of high dose shamanistic psychedelics, but they often felt they had Seen Something of what the mystics talk about
[22:35:21] <mycroftiv> and maybe the mystics talked about the things they saw after eating some of the Odd Fruit
[22:35:28] <mycroftiv> or smoking the green

[22:36:20] <mycroftiv> a broken brain cannot function, but my brain is not broken despite the numerous ways it is Bent. Ive soaked my skull in what seemed like good juices to me, with some smoke for added flavor
[22:36:40] <mycroftiv> and if the medicines i use impair me in some ways, they enhance me in others
[22:37:09] <mycroftiv> we all have different Strong Suits - different colors, different crystals and gems and treasures we have found or made - and we play the game by using our best to do our best
[22:37:41] <mycroftiv> i got handed Fear and Lothing in Las Vegas as an early teen
[22:38:03] <mycroftiv> and as a 'major inspiration' lets just say HST is dangerous for many reasons, altho there are a lot of layers to the onion
[22:38:39] <mycroftiv> but a friend of mine with a name like mine pointed out that in the book, he and his 'attorney' are kinda freakin out and unhappy most of the time, underneath the crazy energy and seeming hedonism
[22:38:45] <mycroftiv> and they dont really treat others well
[22:39:07] <mycroftiv> getting fucked up and treating the world as a stage for your stoned antics aint the Way in my opinion
[22:39:26] <mycroftiv> but thats not what the book tells us to do if we pay attention to what its really all about
[22:39:32] <mycroftiv> as always, theres way way more under the surfacee
[22:39:45] <mycroftiv> its showing how the good dream became a nightmare
[22:40:52] <mycroftiv> how the idea of new flowers of peace and love and understanding turned into something not so good after all, where people were using drugs to not connect but escape things they needed to deal with, and lots of abuse of the young by exploiters
[22:41:27] <mycroftiv> i think its a cliche to say the Haight Ashbury was considered 'dead' (not gratefully cough tho more spirals) by 1969
[22:41:51] <mycroftiv> too much Junk and fakers and people looking to make a quick buck by appropriating the culture
[22:42:41] <mycroftiv> but the good living energy isnt fake and it lives and gets carried forward. some tribes go off and make farm-communes and have rainbow gatherings, some follow the aforementioned Dead
[22:43:21] <mycroftiv> another whole layer here is the Land and Native Americans and their treatment and treaties and that sorry saga we are still needing to fix
[22:44:02] <mycroftiv> that has a complicated relation with the rainbow people but that isnt my direct focus right now, my partner Mav has more direct involvement there, my health issues have been an obstacle for me in some regards
[22:45:22] <mycroftiv> but back in the 60s there was a big swing to seeing the Native peoples as the good folks in the story, who were genocided by the white settlers, and thats pretty factual i think
[22:45:58] <mycroftiv> and seeing the native traditions as a way to improve things, and the hippies tried to adopt and kind of poorly imitate - and ended up appropriating in some maybe harmful ways - aspects of that culture
[22:46:38] <mycroftiv> I believe at this point we pause and then find ourselves smoking peyote ceremonially, which i have not done
[22:46:53] <mycroftiv> perhaps someday i still may because i believe the voyage we are all on is really just beginning
[22:47:47] <mycroftiv> and if with whatever humbleness and openness and awareness i am a guest, and a child of those who inherit the harms done by the previous generation, i might learn such things, i will welcome these meetings and friendships
[22:48:10] <mycroftiv> i feel from reading so many tales like the Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test that 'i was there' but this body was not. other fingers were of course ;)
[22:49:33] <mycroftiv> but the Alembic of mind that is red and blue and split by lightning and breathes new life into being with sacred fire is an eternal time-travelling Vessel and I'm privileged to have stroked it and heard its Tone, and I will try to do so now, if you excuse me

[22:58:46] <mycroftiv> maybe in the most optimistic scenario, which is actually possible, something almost-as-good as a Free Lunch is actually available
[22:58:58] <mycroftiv> something about making an investment prior to the meal
[22:59:16] <mycroftiv> i dunno, put a penny in an account a long time ago, have lunch today on the accumulated interest
[22:59:35] <mycroftiv> i wonder if my grandparents had an idea like that, and there is some Buried Treasure to be found
[22:59:54] <mycroftiv> anyway I think I had gotten to Adams

[23:05:57] <mycroftiv> and im back but probably i have other doors to open and others switchboard connections to make in the big purplechess hypercube of ongoing interactive fiction. so i figure we all will speak again soon, whoever we are now
[23:08:28] <iryith> purplechess hypercube
[23:09:20] <mycroftiv> yes, that isnt word salad, its stuff I make in software in Plan 9
[23:09:52] <iryith> "I read about it once! I wrote it down first and then read it, but it still counts!"
[23:09:55] <mycroftiv> the game of purplechess, played on a binary hypercubic chessboard, randomly generating a yi jing hexagram, trying to make a connection
[23:10:36] <iryith> how can a hypercube be binary
[23:10:52] <causative> if you have 2 of them
[23:10:53] <mycroftiv> iryith: you are putting words in quotes, which I gather means you believe you are paraphrasing me. I'm having a hard time knowing how to answer most usefully.
[23:11:07] <mycroftiv> iryith: its also just a cube with binary bitstring labels on the vertexes
[23:11:14] <mycroftiv> every dimension adds a bit
[23:11:29] <iryith> so the binary part belongs to the label, not the geometry?
[23:11:32] <mycroftiv> this is a graph structure used by computers in the real world, and a network topology
[23:12:00] <mycroftiv> iryith: yes, and binary in some ways becomes 'colorful' as it goes to infinity. but maybe i should slow down.
[23:13:05] <mycroftiv> iryith: if you are interested in what a binary hypercube is, how it was used in real computers, and what kind of software i have done in plan 9 to play with it, the links are on wikipedia or my websites
[23:13:51] <mycroftiv> and indeed everything i do is just some kind of remix, but so it goes, we all just remix and remix and new random elements or choices or whatever you want to call them enter the stew
