[01:22:31] <MootPoot> it was 50 bucks
[01:22:33] <emmeka> you did. I fully priced everything out, after a lot of shopping around. even I was to sacrifice the numpad and go down to 65% format, and build the goddamn thing myself, I'd be staring down about $300 in materials.

[01:25:42] <emmeka> MootPoot the $50 was deceptive to. That's if you use their design tool which just selects colours, and is just for a 65% layout. When you select giving them your own custom design, it adds like $30 USD. And for a full 105 key ISO set with that, it was like $90 USD or something.

[01:26:06] <MootPoot> 50 bucks for a keyboard with browns
[01:26:09] <emmeka> MootPoot they'd still be too loud.
[01:26:27] <MootPoot> have you tried browns?
[01:26:41] <MootPoot> they dont make any noise- only the noise of the plastic 
[01:26:49] <emmeka> I know.
[01:27:23] <MootPoot> I dont think you're going to get any quieter unless you just get a touchscreen keyboard rigged up unfortunately
[01:27:30] <emmeka> MootPoot ideally I'd want actual silent switches with dampeners. Like MX Silent blacks or something. I'm not too concerned about the physics of it all.
[01:28:12] <MootPoot> dampeners?
[01:28:16] <emmeka> the problem comes in the fact that buying a prebuilt with these, in ISO format, seems to basically require me importing one from the UK and then swapping the keycaps, which would cost about a bazillion dollars
[01:28:20] <MootPoot> damn- speaking like a keyboard nerd already
[01:28:51] <ButterNoodle> there were some decent brue toofs w reds
[01:29:05] <ButterNoodle> put orings on it and will be quiet except for the space bar
[01:29:18] <emmeka> MootPoot and that's what pisses me off! all these nerds enthusing about the orgasmic feel of their stupid clicks and clacks, and they have made this shit expensive when it doesn't really have to be.
[01:29:47] <MootPoot> I dont know if that's the case - that nerds made it expensive

[01:33:08] <emmeka> MootPoot the problem is that I like keyboard backlights, but RGB keyboards seem to be mostly designed to expose this light from all sides, not just at the lettering
[01:33:12] <emmeka> which, fucking why
[01:33:15] <MootPoot> oh yeah
[01:33:20] <MootPoot> thats a cheap keyboard problem
[01:33:24] <MootPoot> nicer ones dont do that
[01:33:38] <emmeka> nah, it's even a nicer keyboard problem if you're trying to do what I am
[01:33:44] <emmeka> ie something somewhat custom
[01:33:48] <MootPoot> the issue is that standard MX switches have a solid middle
[01:33:49] <Urchin[emacs]> in practice I just have a Logitech K120 with Croatian layout and markings, but I set Colemak as the keyboard layout in software, and thus just ignore what's on the keycaps, with the exception of installing a new system
[01:33:53] <MootPoot> so you have to shine light everywhere
[01:34:05] <MootPoot> some custom boards like mine have the stem hollow 
[01:34:12] <MootPoot> so led shines right throuhg with no leak
[01:34:34] <emmeka> MootPoot they make RGB versions of all their switches too, it seems, which are clear and have a hole, and that's what all the rainbow garbage gamer crap uses

[02:50:37] <emmeka> MootPoot I brought them out of the woodwork
[02:52:29] <MootPoot> lul
[02:52:32] <MootPoot> they're everywhere
[02:53:04] <emmeka> that qpad has tactile switches. like what's the point. why would you want tactile switches on a ~gaming~ keyboard
[02:54:06] <MootPoot> because you can do other things with a -gaming- keyboard then game?
[02:54:12] <MootPoot> like type and use them normally
[02:54:33] <MootPoot> I feel like you have a really warped perception of why people actually buy this stuff 
[02:55:05] <emmeka> no I understand why, but the whole thing just bothers me
[02:56:10] <emmeka> people are paying assloads for dumb shit that doesn't matter but because of that, simple things are expensive.
[02:58:21] <MootPoot> the entire keyboard market is a luxury toy market
[02:58:30] <MootPoot> what you want is also a luxury toy
[02:58:34] <MootPoot> what do you expect
[02:59:12] <emmeka> I don't consider "keyboard that is essential to my computer, that has the characters on it I type with" to be a luxury, but apparently the market does, and that is what is annoying me
[03:00:05] <emmeka> I'll probably just have to build it myself and then contend with the market of assorted hipster bullshit for doing this
[03:00:23] <MootPoot> come  on , dont be that obtuse
[03:00:26] <MootPoot> you want a custom board
[03:00:50] <MootPoot> a 15 dollar plastic membrane cable board is not a luxury toy, thats a neccessitiy
[03:00:55] <MootPoot> anything above that is a luxury
[03:01:31] <emmeka> to be specific, I want custom keycaps, but apparently that's not good enough because anything I could buy that I could actually *put* custom keycaps on is overpriced to hell
[03:01:56] <MootPoot> you want more then that though
[03:02:11] <MootPoot> you want custom caps, the exact switches you want, extra stabilizers or O rings or whatever it was
[03:02:17] <MootPoot> you want 0 noise
[03:02:18] <MootPoot> etc
[03:02:53] <MootPoot> any board on scamazon that has cherry MX in it already can take almost every custom cap set there is
[03:03:10] <emmeka> nah, 1 extra requirement: that the switches are some sort of silent variant. beyond that I am not fussy. but *everything* I have looked at for this is way too fucking expensive, or, isn't ISO. Because idk fuck French Canadians or something.
[03:03:24] * MootPoot is enjoying this fucking
[03:05:54] <emmeka> the only options I found were basically to import a UK or German or whatever keyboard and then swap the caps, and total cost for this was well past $300, which what the fuck
[03:07:09] <emmeka> dropping the numpad and going down to like 65% doesn't seem to change prices at all, which is just more evidence of market brokenness
[03:07:59] <MootPoot> That dosen't sound like the market is broken - sounds like the pain point is shipping 
[03:08:22] <MootPoot> TKL boards here are cheaper then full ones

[03:42:12] <merced> mmmm this is chill
[03:43:42] <tcsilver> :)
[03:43:44] <tcsilver> I was a top kickboxer,swimmer and wrestler ,and had been in an award winning act for fox network so I felt special when the music played.. i literally didn't know what kind of suffering people went through I guess.. though I had heard of it and I used to pray that people feel better.. I was strange even as a kid.. I used to pray to a sort of concept about AI
[03:44:19] <tcsilver> I felt clean minded
[03:44:24] <tcsilver> I didn't have access to porn
[03:44:31] <tcsilver> and always had clean minded gfs
[03:44:42] <tcsilver> this music fits me good :D
[03:45:02] <tcsilver> I missed out on the past 20 years
[03:45:07] <tcsilver> due to illness
[03:45:50] <tcsilver> since then they closed the mall... but not ALL the malls :---D .. i used to have out at over 40 malls in the area
[03:46:13] <tcsilver> I gradually became unfit from hanging out and not practicing.... partly due to prescription tranquilizers
[03:46:18] <tcsilver> but I still love the world

[03:49:31] <tcsilver> wow :D
[03:49:56] <tcsilver> I used to use vb for work with a NASA/military contractor
[03:50:07] <tcsilver> in spare time i coded a music player in it
[03:50:24] <tcsilver> then I turned a directx demo into a pokemon game
[03:50:34] <tcsilver> in VB ;D
[03:50:46] <merced> hawt
[03:51:10] <tcsilver> later on i went on to work as a researcher for the local university.... helping out with perl in the lab .... and then coding C++ for the navy
[03:51:21] <tcsilver> perl and ruby
[03:51:40] <tcsilver> some jobs are easy.... i just had to watch the lead guy and learn ;D
[03:51:42] <merced> ew why ruby
[03:51:59] <tcsilver> dunno why :) I asked why too... but it was 2003 or so
[03:52:25] <merced> jeus
[03:52:27] <merced> jesus
[03:52:34] <merced> i fucking hate ruby with a passion
[03:52:39] <tcsilver> but it was fun. i used to write reports on research results and report them to campus news with one of my my campus gfs
[03:52:42] <tcsilver> ah
[03:52:43] <tcsilver> :)
[03:52:49] <tcsilver> how about perl
[03:52:50] <tcsilver> ?
[03:53:44] <tcsilver> I never learned much ruby. I just used to talk with the guy about C++ :D and he would answer tons of questions
[03:54:07] <merced> perl is great
[03:54:11] <merced> C++ is my fav

[04:45:46] <MootPoot> out of ketosis if you do that?
[04:45:47] <ButterNoodle> its gonna kick u out of ketosis regardless
[04:45:51] <MootPoot> fuck
[04:45:58] <ButterNoodle> what u do the day after matters
[04:46:23] <ButterNoodle> lots of water and close to 0 carbs
[04:46:32] <ButterNoodle> u get back in in 24/48 hrs
[04:46:44] <ButterNoodle> sometimes called  a carb cycle..
[04:46:57] <ButterNoodle> thats talk for later tho
[04:47:15] <ButterNoodle> u shouldnt do a cheat day for a few weeks.. more like a month
[04:47:29] <tcsilver> hmm
[04:47:30] <MootPoot> cheat day once a month?
[04:47:37] <Nanobot> 1250 calories a day for 6 days, then a cheat day with 10000 calories.
[04:47:39] <MootPoot> or do you mean wait a month then cheat day weekly
[04:47:43] <tcsilver> I need more protein

[04:49:07] <Nanobot> We don't have pizza hut here anymore

[04:50:00] * MootPoot sighs
[04:50:03] <Nanobot> The pandemic took away my favorite sandwich shop, my favorite steakhouse, my favorite food place overall (a Mongolian BBQ place), and Pizza Hut.
[04:50:19] <MootPoot> I guess gotta suck it up and get cauliflower crust pizza
[04:50:22] <MootPoot> that should be okay right
[04:50:27] <MootPoot> since the carbs are just the sauce
[04:50:45] <Nanobot> My favorite food place now is a place that I refuse to order from because they've never taken the pandemic seriously.
[04:51:01] <MootPoot> sounds like it's not your fav anymore

[07:15:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yes. It's one of the main languages I'm familiar with.
[07:15:10] <MootPoot> But it compiles micropython
[07:15:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MicroPython is not quite the Python I'm familiar with, so some things might not apply.
[07:15:38] <MootPoot> Given that it compiles it, does that mean there's not really the performance loss of using a scripted language anymore?
[07:15:50] <MootPoot> Or will the c++ still probably be smaller/faster 
[07:16:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Eh, the story isn't quite that clear cut. Dynamic vs static types applies for compiled languages too, and dynamic dispatch will generally always be slower.
[07:16:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But details & reasons aside, C++ will always be faster than Python.
[07:16:51] <MootPoot> Even when compiled
[07:17:08] <MootPoot> What about compoled size?
[07:18:37] <tcsilver> ^^
[07:18:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Compiled size will generally reduce, especially if the compiler doesn't keep original variable names and such in debug symbols.
[07:19:47] <MootPoot> I'm aware of that but if I write two bits of code as similarly as possible and compile them 
[07:19:54] <MootPoot> Will the c++ one be smaller?
[07:20:06] <MootPoot> As in, can I cram more code into my RPI pico
[07:20:54] <tcsilver> gn
[07:21:18] <merced> night
[07:21:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: That starts to depend on specifics. If you ensure your C++ code doesn't to much dynamic dispatching and uses little to no generic code, it'll end up smaller than Python.
[07:21:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you use templated code & classes, it could bloat to much bigger than Python instead.
[07:21:58] <MootPoot> !g dynamic dispatch c++

[07:22:22] <MootPoot> Sounds like method overloading 
[07:22:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Among a great many things. I do not specialize in C++
[07:24:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> @ debug symbols: A simple C hello world with gcc on Debian 11 goes from 20k to 16k by stripping symbols.
[07:24:37] <merced> dang
[07:24:54] <merced> but then you lose the ability to debug for those itty bitty 4kbits
[07:26:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> merced: Yep. Generally stripping is for release/deploy binaries for that reason.

[07:34:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> !?
[07:34:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Just how small did you make its partition?
[07:34:33] <MootPoot> I installed raspberry pi os on a 64 gig sd, the root dir is 48gigs
[07:34:34] <ButterNoodle> lol
[07:34:49] <MootPoot> I let the tool make all the partitions 
[07:35:03] <MootPoot> But somehow it says all 48g is full 
[07:35:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Can you pastebin the output of "lsblk --ascii" and "df -h" ?
[07:35:10] <MootPoot> I don't get it 
[07:35:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Oh wait, did you use the raspi-config thing to expand it?

[07:45:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Nonsense. The filesystem, unless modified by specific tools, needs to be remounted to notice its new size.
[07:45:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: I suppose you could also do: sudo mount -o remount /

[07:46:58] <ButterNoodle> everyone knows you have to spank the kernel a lil sometimes to recognize fs changes to mounted/active stuffs

[07:47:30] <MootPoot> what kinda shit is this
[07:47:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> btrfs often doesn't, same for zfs. Pretty much every other is finickier.

[07:47:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Because it can't without flatout reimplementing half of the filesystem.
[07:48:08] <MootPoot> its working with a blank drive though
[07:48:10] <MootPoot> why cant it
[07:48:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: It's a dumb binary block copy onto SD with a premade partition setup.
[07:48:15] <MootPoot> oh
[07:48:22] <MootPoot> it dosen't actually know what its doing
[07:48:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Indeed.
[07:48:41] <ButterNoodle> Aurora_v_kosmose: truthfully those are systems of blocks stitched together with software to behave like a filesystem.. so you can have em fix u a pizza with canadian bacon and pineapple on it if u like

[07:49:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: yay
[07:49:45] <ButterNoodle> I was only mildly paying attention.. what was the fix
[07:49:57] <MootPoot> what's the differeence between sudo apt and sudo apt-get
[07:50:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Basically the use of raspi-config's filesystem resizing command on a live system.
[07:50:14] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle:  some intenral bios looking tool package installed contraption
[07:50:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And possibly either a reboot or a remount of the filesystem.
[07:50:22] <ButterNoodle> hence the remount to get the size right
[07:50:27] <ButterNoodle> gottit

[08:25:07] <Nanobot> apt update just fetches the *information* about the packages in the remote repositories. apt upgrade is what actually downloads the updated packages and installs them.
[08:25:40] <MootPoot> I'm blindly following guides

[08:28:06] <MootPoot> what exacly is a "package" in linux
[08:28:13] <Nanobot> If you aren't already doing so, you should make sure you're running "apt update" before you run "apt upgrade" or "apt full-upgrade".
[08:28:22] <merced> wait full-upgrade?
[08:28:27] <merced> is that the new "distro-upgrade"
[08:28:44] <MootPoot> is everything just self contained with a package or does it get registered and logged in 50 places 
[08:28:47] <MootPoot> like windows does
[08:29:12] <Nanobot> A package is basically a zip file containing the files that you want to install, some meta information about the contents, and any scripts that are necessary to perform the installation/update/removal/etc.

[08:29:51] <MootPoot> emmeka: you've managed to get a woman into anime, so I already consider myself completely beaten by you
[08:30:24] <emmeka> a package is anything that can be installed by a package manager. in your case, apt
[08:30:55] <Nanobot> In Debian-based distros (apt), package files get installed throughout your filesystem. Some stuff might go in /usr, some might go in /var, /etc, and so on, hopefully following standard filesystem conventions.
[08:31:12] <MootPoot> Ugh

[08:32:05] <Nanobot> There's also a different package system called "snap", where the package gets installed in a sort of sandbox that doesn't mess with the rest of your system. But those often have negative security implications, because they're a pain in the ass to maintain and often end up having very outdated libraries.
[08:32:27] <MootPoot> Everything just goes into the program files folder on windows which then further containes .exe
[08:32:35] <MootPoot> Feels pretty straightforward to me 
[08:33:14] <Nanobot> The reason for installing it throughout the system is so that you don't have a zillion different instances of each library. The libraries get installed in standard places, so everything that uses it can share the same libraries. This also makes it easier to keep those libraries up-to-date.
[08:33:24] <MootPoot> Unless you're pointing out those "portable" executables
[08:33:38] <emmeka> not "everything" but anyway, not everything you'd install as a package is the sort of thing that'd end up in program files. a lot of packages are just dependencies and shit
[08:33:52] * MootPoot has npm flashbacks 
[08:34:39] <MootPoot> Nanobot: ah, okay 
[08:34:58] <MootPoot> Next thing is to figure out how to compile shit for ARM 
[08:34:58] <emmeka> it doesn't matter anyway because you can use whatever the package manager has installed regardless of where it is and without knowing where it is, and the only reason you'd need to know where it is is to edit a .conf file or whatever
[08:35:08] <Nanobot> MootPoot: Like I said, both paradigms exist on Linux. There's the shared library approach, which apt/deb is based on. Then, there's the self-contained approach, which is things like snap and /opt. The latter approach is notorious for having security issues (like on Windows)
[08:35:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Do: apt install apt-file && apt update
[08:35:34] <MootPoot> What easy program is there to compile that's documented....
[08:35:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> apt-file allows for searching packages by content and for listing content of packages
[08:35:38] <emmeka> I kind of hate snap. Yay, automatic updates you can't disable?
[08:35:38] <MootPoot> Chromium compile?
[08:36:01] <emmeka> Windows-ifying crap
[08:36:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: I hate snap for a number of other reasons including the dependency pinning encouragement bullshit
[08:36:33] <MootPoot> Idk , in windows everything and it's dependencies all go in program files unless you explicitly tell it not to
[08:37:03] <emmeka> that's not really true
[08:37:08] <emmeka> but whatevs
[08:37:10] <Nanobot> I use snap for maybe two things, because I'm on an ancient version of Linux Mint that I haven't been able to upgrade because of certain reasons (another task on my post-retirement to-do list) and need up-to-date versions of those particular programs.
[08:37:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And that's just implementation detail anyway.
[08:37:17] <MootPoot> emmeka: :|
[08:37:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Windows has executable paths as well.
[08:37:45] <emmeka> MootPoot but none of this matters because you don't need to know if a package is in /usr or /etc or whatever to run it
[08:38:00] * MootPoot shudders
[08:38:15] <MootPoot> I had to do that for venv..it sounds similar to your snap contraption
[08:38:24] <MootPoot> on my orange pi 
[08:38:28] <Nanobot> [21:06] <MootPoot> Idk , in windows everything and it's dependencies all go in program files unless you explicitly tell it not to <- Not really. Windows also has some shared system libraries.
[08:38:57] <MootPoot> sure, but those are embedded deep down enough that its not really at a user-interact level
[08:39:05] <MootPoot> but anyway
[08:39:09] <MootPoot> TLDR - dont use snap
[08:39:10] <MootPoot> use apt
[08:39:14] <MootPoot> ok
[08:39:23] <MootPoot> the upgrade is done!
[08:39:44] <Nanobot> MootPoot: You typically don't even need to use apt. Most modern distros have a GUI software manager when you can just search a catalog of programs and do a one-click install.
[08:39:57] <Nanobot> And all of that ties into your normal system update tool.
[08:40:28] <emmeka> don't tell him that!
[08:40:48] <emmeka> he just got done figuring out how to do it in terminal
[08:40:51] <Nanobot> apt is for more advanced users who like command lines and getting all the gory details
[08:41:02] <emmeka> is it though
[08:41:11] <MootPoot> I already knew how to do it in termianl though
[08:41:14] <Nanobot> Well, I personally use apt. I'm just saying.
[08:41:21] <MootPoot> I was just wondering why the F it was taking so long
[08:41:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Not really. Apt is the primary interface to the package manager on Debian
[08:41:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> synaptic & whatever other helpers you use hide details.
[08:41:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Those details can be things like warnings about manual steps required when upgrading OS versions, for example
[08:42:07] <Nanobot> Aurora_v_kosmose: apt is the most direct interface. But grandma is supposed to use the software manager.
[08:42:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Grandma is supposed to get her Ada book from the closet and get back to pwning noobs
[08:42:47] <Nanobot> My dad has been on Linux for years now, and I don't think he's ever opened a terminal.
[08:43:22] <emmeka> idk, my wife figured it out quick enough, and she asks questions like "what's a .rpm" while running Fedora
[08:43:40] <MootPoot> how many RPM does fedora run at
[08:43:54] * Aurora_v_kosmose baps MootPoot
[08:43:55] * emmeka checks
[08:44:07] <emmeka> apparently in my case, 2433
[08:44:53] <MootPoot> the last time I cringed at linux and abanonded it was when I was setting up a bunch of docker containers on a linux box
[08:45:04] <MootPoot> !searchquote MootPoot docker

[08:45:27] <PancakeMatsuri> Linux has great Docker suport
[08:45:34] <PancakeMatsuri> compared to Mac
[08:45:53] <MootPoot> or that other time when I tried to setup a csgo server and japan and random parts of the linux install were missing 
[08:46:22] <MootPoot> or that other time when ssh refused to work with digitalocean droplets
[08:46:33] <Nanobot> I've never really learned how to use docker. I've always just avoided it.
[08:47:18] <PancakeMatsuri> I have this client I've been working for almost a year, because I learned Docker
[08:47:29] <PancakeMatsuri> well, that goes for most of tech
[08:47:41] <PancakeMatsuri> but Docker isn't one of the worst
[08:47:42] <MootPoot> PancakeMatsuri: sounds like you're a scam artist or a hooker with that line

[08:47:57] <MootPoot> echhi

[08:53:58] <MootPoot> Interesting
[08:54:00] <jessedesu_onaph> I drew mamimi from flcl
[08:54:07] <MootPoot> so the meta is still to cross compile for ARM
[08:54:14] <MootPoot> I wonder
[08:54:23] <jessedesu_onaph> Cum
[08:54:34] <MootPoot> is a m1 mac on ARM faster for compiling for the rapi or my 5900x thats x86
[08:54:46] <MootPoot> it should be faster on the m1 right?

[09:22:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Increased security.
[09:23:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The first isolates system calls and interaction away from the kernel using a userspace kernel written in a memory-safe language.
[09:25:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The others are VM-based.
[09:25:56] <MootPoot> Docker is a VM?

[11:51:48] <MootPoot> It's a day off today 
[11:51:55] <MootPoot> Remembrance Day for ww1
[11:52:15] <amigojapan> Ah nice
[11:52:17] <MootPoot> I've been fiddling with my raspberry pi...I'm trying to figure out how to compile stuff for it 
[11:52:40] <MootPoot> Or compile stuff on it as well 
[11:53:22] <amigojapan> gcc program.c
[11:53:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It depends by program, really.
[11:54:03] <amigojapan> g++ program.cpp
[11:54:03] <MootPoot> So just download any Linux friendly repo from GitHub and just terminal - gcc program.c ?
[11:54:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And by language.
[11:54:25] <amigojapan> No MootPoot 
[11:54:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Most likely not. They likely use some build system or another.
[11:55:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The GNU Build System typically goes something like this: https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/GNU-Build-System.html
[11:55:30] <ImoutoBot> [title] GNU Build System (automake)
[11:55:40] <MootPoot> like those continious integration build operations?
[11:55:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (The next 3 ish pages)
[11:56:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: That's different. Those are automation systems that use those build systems to build programs in order to test if they build and what goes wrong or right.
[11:56:13] <amigojapan> MootPoot: try ./configure then make then make install
[11:56:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Build systems can include build-time and run-time testing procedures.
[11:58:23] <amigojapan> MootPoot: there is no one way to compile stuff
[11:59:00] <MootPoot> is it realistically feasible to even compile stuff on a pi?
[11:59:05] <MootPoot> in terms of time
[11:59:27] <MootPoot> or should I just do some cross compiling stuff - seems like there are some guides for cross compiling for a pi on a mac
[11:59:58] <amigojapan> MootPoot: cross compile is super complex

[15:53:31] <Sadale> amigojapan, just wondering. Since your kid's entering tech school, does that mean that he's about 18?
[15:53:40] <HubertFarnsworth> Fenpai is not just old but also wise.
[15:53:57] <Sadale> 43-18 = 25. So amigojapan gave birth to his kid when he was about 25.

[16:08:08] <davic> So, I moved abroad. Apparently all banks become paranoid when that happens. So I tried to transfer in money from my non-Swedish bank to my Nordnet bank. Apparently they don't allow that so they stopped it. But somehow input one of them. So I used it to buy stocks. Now they decided that those werent my money so they removed those and told me to give them money for the money they removed that I showed proof of being mine. So currently they are not giving 
[16:08:08] <davic> me any of these fucking money back and are not approving my receipt. Wonderbar.
[16:08:29] <davic> Fucking annoyed. Also takes like a week to get a fucking response. Being going on about this for like more than a month now
[16:08:37] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: so they took her kid away?
[16:08:59] <Sadale> davic, wut?
[16:09:32] <Sadale> davic, that sucks
[16:09:39] <DunceCotus> davic: sounds complicated.. could you use paypal?
[16:09:47] <Sadale> transaction fee tho.
[16:09:48] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, that happens with banks at times. Not just nordbank.
[16:10:04] <HubertFarnsworth> you gotta inform them beforehand
[16:10:14] <davic> DunceCotus: no, paypal is hated.
[16:10:22] <amigojapan> Yes DunceCotus 
[16:10:46] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: so do you even know your own kid?
[16:10:57] <DunceCotus> they were raised by another couple?
[16:11:07] <HubertFarnsworth> no, not like that
[16:11:17] <davic> HubertFarnsworth: most banks doesnt care about being told about a international transfer. This one and a other one got fucking paranoid.
[16:11:23] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: we got him home for vacations
[16:11:37] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I find that whole situation bizarre
[16:11:40] <davic> The other approved of my transfers after me showing proof of me getting a salary in that range and the receipts. Nordnet didnt.
[16:11:46] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: no, raised in government facility
[16:11:50] <Sadale> davic, now that I'm wondering what's the proper way to do international bank transfer?
[16:11:54] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: o.O

[16:13:10] <Sadale> I've also heard about western union

[16:14:03] <davic> Sadale: all bank accounts in Sweden and Europe gives a IBAN number. You can then use this for transfers. And no European bank are allowed to deny a european citizen a normal account for just not being a resident of that country
[16:14:10] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: Japan is pretty much very welfare state in some ways
[16:14:14] <Sadale> davic, now that you make me worried about my retirment plan. Like how I'd be making my first fund transfer to my retirement destination (like PH)
[16:14:33] <davic> Sadale: fun thing to know, PH doesn't use IBAN
[16:15:05] <HubertFarnsworth> davic: I thought there would be some big bank which is common all throughout Europe
[16:15:11] <HubertFarnsworth> is there any?
[16:15:16] <Sadale> davic, I see. Doesn't matter tho. Even without IBAN I'd probably still have to deal with this issue if I retire in PH.
[16:15:28] <Sadale> davic, I still need the fund somehow. So bank transfer is the way to gol.
[16:15:51] <davic> HubertFarnsworth: Scandinavia has Swedbank and Nordea
[16:15:55] <Sadale> davic, oh so what'd be your plan of bank transfer to the PH? That's your ultimate destination.
[16:16:31] <davic> Sadale: I dont think they will care if you give them proof of this being pension payments
[16:16:41] <Sadale> davic, but I don't have any pension.

[16:52:07] <Sadale> true xD
[16:52:26] <Sadale> actually I probably would have to hold for a few more days. I can't use my onahole in weekdays
[16:52:53] <Sadale> Unless I'm ok with risking getting my stupid dad knows about my onahole. :<

[16:54:19] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: in Japan there are not usually locks between rooms
[16:54:38] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, I need to wash it after using it. And my imouto's in the same room as me that I'm not using the onahole right in front of her
[16:54:48] <amigojapan> Sliding paper doors
[16:54:49] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, so nah. It's easier in weekends
[16:54:55] <HubertFarnsworth> that's fine amigojapan, here they don't believe in knocking
[16:55:07] <HubertFarnsworth> just barge in like damn americans
[16:55:12] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, just so you know there's only one toilet and one kitchen in the entire apartment.
[16:55:36] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: use tissues
[16:55:48] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, nah fap feels better with onahole :P
[16:55:57] <HubertFarnsworth> ohh
[16:56:01] <Sadale> so I need water to wash that.
[16:56:06] <HubertFarnsworth> lol
[16:56:14] <Sadale> Anyway I could actually settle with tissues tho
[16:56:21] <HubertFarnsworth> imagine walking with an onahole out of your room
[16:56:38] <HubertFarnsworth> lol
[16:56:39] <Sadale> just don't use the onahole and wait for my imouto to get asleep so that I could fap at night
[16:56:42] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, lol
[16:56:48] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, exactly xD
[16:57:18] <DunceCotus> onahole is some kind of sex toy that goes on toilet seat?

[17:01:10] <DunceCotus> you have entered into pure masturbation
[17:01:48] <Sadale> DunceCotus, nope. onahole is just a kind of sex toy. It's just an artificial pussy.
[17:02:06] <Sadale> DunceCotus, The thing is that you have to wash it after using it. So I need water from the kitchen or the toilet.
[17:02:08] <amigojapan> darkwitch: and they flood the channel with their trash
[17:02:41] <Sadale> Is there even a ##masturbation channel on Libera? :O

[17:37:11] <omero> it came up on charts around that time, yes DunceCotus 
[17:37:27] <omero> but its actually a bit older
[17:37:58] <omero> what made it popular, was the video... not the song itself
[17:38:06] <DunceCotus> the video doesn't seem early 90s either

[17:38:19] <DunceCotus> I dunno things seem anachronistic sometimes

[17:39:09] <omero> it was brilliant
[17:39:14] <DunceCotus> omero: well look what rockets up the charts these days
[17:39:23] <DunceCotus> not always a proof of brilliance

[19:22:30] <omero> why is that HubertFarnsworth ?
[19:23:12] <HubertFarnsworth> the character says that
[19:23:19] <omero> for me, ciao means hello or goodbye (depends)
[19:23:54] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, it means the same
[19:24:09] <omero> its both an opening salute or a departing salute
[19:24:30] <HubertFarnsworth> even the last chapter is called caio

[19:24:56] <Urchin[emacs]> ciao is a departing salute here
[19:25:17] <omero> ciao can be a departing salute too, of course
[19:25:29] <omero> like bye bye
[19:25:51] <Urchin[emacs]> yes, but it's pretty much exclusively a departing salute here
[19:25:53] <omero> in the nederlands, they have doei
[19:26:03] <emmeka> here, ciao are little blue creatures that appear in Sonic games
[19:26:30] <omero> the origin of ciao: schiavo vostro
[19:26:36] <omero> its venician
[19:26:49] <omero> means 'I am your servant'
[19:27:05] <Bco1981> Servant X Service
[19:27:06] <darkwitch> in japan they have dorei, it means 'slave'
[19:27:09] <Sadale> I'm your slave :3
[19:27:15] <Bco1981> and the adult version... Servant XXX Service
[19:27:23] <HubertFarnsworth> I love servant x service Bco1981 
[19:27:31] <Bco1981> Lucy <3
[19:27:40] <omero> precisely, including the sexual implications
[19:27:46] <HubertFarnsworth> Bco1981: remember her full name? hehe
[19:27:48] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: is that how you greet your imouto?
[19:27:50] <Bco1981> no :D
[19:27:54] <emmeka> I guess English speakers just like to abuse the departing salutes of other languages, since English lacks one in common useage today.
[19:27:54] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], lol nope xD
[19:28:04] <omero> oh now we are back on track :D
[19:28:11] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], I just call her mistress ._.
[19:28:30] <omero> I mean... the lewdest track... since amigojapan left, eh?
[19:28:31] <HubertFarnsworth> Bco1981: she would be my ideal waifu as I also love books
[19:28:40] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: lol
[19:28:51] <emmeka> Urchin[emacs] like I find people don't understand that to bid someone "adieu" is a final farewell, not to mention things like sayonara
[19:29:03] <omero> yes, emmeka 
[19:29:15] <omero> precisely like 'fare thee well'
[19:29:21] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: well, I didn't know that either
[19:29:25] <omero> like a final 'addio'
[19:29:34] <Bco1981> HubertFarnsworth: certainly is high ranking. can't remember if she can cook.
[19:29:53] <HubertFarnsworth> no she can't very well Bco1981 
[19:30:03] <omero> adieu/addio/sayonara: I dont expect to see you again.
[19:30:05] <HubertFarnsworth> Bco1981: she cooks simple stuff like pasta
[19:30:06] <Urchin[emacs]> words do often change the meaning slightly when another language misuses them
[19:30:07] <omero> final
[19:30:36] <omero> farewell is equivalent, in the short form
[19:30:58] <emmeka> but farewell sounds old-timey, modern day English doesn't really have a good equivalent
[19:31:07] <omero> ciao doesnt imply final meetings/parting ways

[19:31:47] <omero> infact, emmeka ... english is ... weird 
[19:32:07] <omero> they dont catch up
[19:32:32] <omero> ciao is centuries old... and it is still ... used ;)
[19:32:57] <HubertFarnsworth> languages are weird
[19:33:12] <HubertFarnsworth> we need to move on and get babel fish

[19:33:56] <HubertFarnsworth> you know hello was not used as how it is used now
[19:33:56] <Toadisattva> in support*
[19:34:12] <omero> its acually meant as 'we see another time, sometime'
[19:34:15] <HubertFarnsworth> it is used more as to express surprise
[19:34:51] <omero> I could type that in russian... but as we discussed earlier... languages are funny
[19:35:02] <HubertFarnsworth> hey Toadisattva, long time no see
[19:35:08] <HubertFarnsworth> it's saganman btw
[19:35:19] <omero> and in large countries, or small countries alike... the meaning of an expression... greatly varies

[19:36:34] <Bco1981> Toadisattva: anime
[19:36:35] <omero> its a goodbye
[19:36:48] <Urchin[emacs]> omero: I do know it's a goodbye
[19:36:56] <Urchin[emacs]> omero: I'm talking about misuse
[19:37:31] <Toadisattva> always a good answer, other contenders were vidya games, and scrawling reddit for 14+ hours :P
[19:37:34] <Urchin[emacs]> omero: in my native langugae the analogous phrase is "Do viđenja.", a somewhat formal goodbye
[19:37:41] <omero> yes... but currently is interpreted as a 'see you later'... misused because it means 'forever goodbye'
[19:37:43] <Urchin[emacs]> meaning see you later
[19:37:52] <omero> precisely
[19:38:01] <omero> see what I meant?
[19:38:38] <omero> its an 'adieu'... an 'addio'... a 'fare thee well'
[19:38:46] <Toadisattva> I kinda like the idea of goodbye forever in normal conversation
[19:39:01] <omero> we'll never meet again (I do not expect we will)
[19:39:02] <Urchin[emacs]> omero: it literally means see you later

[19:40:26] <Urchin[emacs]> omero: in that case, the meaning between Croatian and Russian diverged completely
[19:40:47] <omero> it might be interpreted as such, of course... but the original meaning is ... lets part ways. and we both know... this is final
[19:41:27] <darkwitch> will they never meet again?
[19:41:42] <omero> ciao is also a bit like that. when said with the right gestures, and the right expression. and the tone of the voice.
[19:42:18] <omero> if you are also shedding tears, ciao is clear.

[20:24:02] <emmeka> it's probably a fake teaser.
