[21:07:53] <SigmoidFroid> ⇒  Overview — Deep Learning for Molecules and Materials
[21:09:15] <mefistofeles> dostoyevsky2: I guess, but geometric deep learning is probably too new in that case
[21:09:25] <mefistofeles> books are never really up to date with the state of the art
[21:09:30] *** Quits: ohyeahprivacy (~ohyeahpri@193.32.127.240) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[21:12:14] <dostoyevsky2> Yeah... I've been watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6Pw4MOzMuo the other day, but it didn't feel that revolutionary for me.  Graph matching has been done before in many papers, it's just natural when you think about certain problems.  So I still don't really see what the big deal might be
[21:12:15] <SigmoidFroid> ⇒  ICLR 2021 Keynote - "Geometric Deep Learning: The Erlangen Programme of ML" - M Bronstein - YouTube, 00:38:26
[21:12:54] <mefistofeles> dostoyevsky2: I guess the big deal is it emerging as a whole new subfield... because it's becoming pretty big
[21:13:28] <mefistofeles> I mean, the same can be said about almost everything :)
[21:18:27] <dostoyevsky2> mefistofeles: I'd say that CNNs really hadn't a lot of applications before using them for NNs... so they kind of revolutionized working with visual kernels, and using them with backprop to actually guess suitable values was surely pretty powerful... but graph matching... 80% of Knuth/Cormen's books are graph algorithms... that's the whole computer science 101
[21:19:01] <dostoyevsky2> Yeah, ok, maybe ML experts discovered those books in 2021... fair enough
[21:19:14] <mefistofeles> dostoyevsky2: sure, but it's much more than graph matching
[21:19:43] <mefistofeles> because you have to add flexibility (randomness) and this is when it becomes really tricky, or very specific and it has blown since the first attempts
[21:20:53] <mefistofeles> I mean, it's like saying computer/information theory in Turing era was just redefinding Boltzmann's work and statistical mechanics, which is not wrong... but it is also huge on itself
[21:21:11] <mefistofeles> there are no original ideas, that's a given
[21:24:11] <dostoyevsky2> I guess I am not 100% sure how backprop'able graph algorithms are in general... maybe the revolutionary idea lies in that?
[21:25:19] <dostoyevsky2> that those graph models are actually differentiable?
[21:26:56] <mefistofeles> yeah, that sounds like something
[21:27:06] <mefistofeles> (I still don't understand it)
[21:27:14] <mefistofeles> but I know it's a big deal for reasons
[21:27:21] <mefistofeles> well, not huge, but big enough surely
[21:28:01] <dostoyevsky2> but aren't some graph problems NP-hard, like the travelling salesman?  Sure, autodiff might be able to cut that down.. but it just sounds impossible

[21:33:23] <dostoyevsky2> Also, the other day I had some idea of using regular expression matching in NNs... I guess the ICLR 2022 keynote is my time to shine

[21:34:24] <mefistofeles> go for it :)
[21:39:44] <dostoyevsky2> I mean they've done regular expressions to death for gene sequencing in the 2000's, but now using it in a NN is the revolution...
[21:50:46] <mefistofeles> dostoyevsky2: yes, sounds like something very AI/ML/DL worthy

[21:57:35] <dostoyevsky2> The ethz and Oxford statistics professors are all members of the R core team.. not sure if the MIT has a reputable stats department, and if they indeed prefer Julia.. but I think Julia is made by MIT's Math department
[22:01:30] <dostoyevsky2> Which is why Julia shines for simulations... whereas R shines for models that are applicable to something... basically a papers+code that goes back to the 1990's

[22:31:35] <Klinda> your name is something related to hadoop?
[22:32:57] <stefan-_> fun fact, word2vec.c is multi-threaded and shares the word vector matrices between all learner threads, that means there can be collisions during training, e.g. reading + writing the same vectors
[22:33:01] <stefan-_> that method has actually a name: asynchronous stochastic gradient descent, see https://groups.google.com/g/word2vec-toolkit/c/NLvYXU99cAM/m/rryQhcaxKSQJ
[22:33:02] <SigmoidFroid> ⇒  de-obfuscated Python + question
[22:36:32] <dostoyevsky2> hodapp: I really loved Julia for the simulations... Was really the first language that had a proper weather model, which is really fun to play around with in a notebook...  They say that most of those models are very simplified though, but it still feels great... much better to be able to use them interactively than using some C/C++ mammoth like MuJoCo
[22:41:32] <dostoyevsky2> hodapp: That being said #julia is not really helpful... and I didn't want to use slack
[22:41:51] <hodapp> hmm. I was logged into their Slack at one point but Slack irks me, despite that I have to use it for a bunch of things

[22:49:14] <dostoyevsky2> they then started to use toml files to pin all the versions of libraries, which might help
