[03:48:42] <aphysically> furq: apparently a bunch of other fields are broken in ffprobe too, the problem was a commit removed the stuff that made them work (cause it was within deprecated guards?) but didn't deprecate the features themselves
[03:48:56] <aphysically> unclear why
[03:49:43] <durandal11707> aphysically: bunch?
[03:50:04] <aphysically> I don't know how much, everything that depended on properties and the coded_w/h
[03:50:12] <aphysically> if you have a list that would help someone remove it in master correctly
[03:50:35] <aphysically> do you have a list?
[03:52:43] <durandal11707> huh, you first start claiming it is a bunch
[03:53:50] <aphysically> at least 4, which was the bunch I was referring to, if you're asking for an exact number I don't know
[03:58:52] <aphysically> durandal11707: do you know how I can find them so I can add to the bug?
[04:01:22] <aphysically> I understand this removal is sensitive for some reason that's unclear to me, but I'm just trying to catalogue the information needed to fix master
[04:02:03] <aphysically> (and 4.4)
[04:02:15] <aphysically> although I think 4.4 might be fixable with a revert
[04:04:10] <znf> can you link the commit that broke it?

[04:13:53] <durandal11707> how much time passed since regression?
[04:14:32] <aphysically> uhhh 7 months maybe? Are you wanting to bring the features back?
[04:14:53] <aphysically> in the case of release version the regression was in the 4.4 release
[04:15:00] <aphysically> so whenever that was
[04:15:05] <durandal11707> too long
[04:15:31] <aphysically> too long for what?
[04:16:27] <softworkz> not too long, but I would say too big

[04:16:47] <softworkz> here https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/3749eede

[15:24:33] <hardcoresushi> Hi, I have some troubles compiling ffmpeg for Android. I found this ticket: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/4928 that says we must use --disable-asm when building for x86. But I also get relocation errors with other architectures like arm64: ld: error: relocation R_AARCH64_ADR_PREL_PG_HI21 cannot be used against symbol ff_cos_32; >>> defined in ../../../../ffmpeg/build/arm64-v8a/libavcodec/libavcodec.a(fft_float.o)
[15:25:24] <hardcoresushi> Strange thing: I got this error with NDK r23 but everything goes fine with NDK r21e

[15:28:04] <JEEB> I know at least one project that seems to be building FFmpeg for arm and aarch64 with the NDK
[15:29:11] <JEEB> seems to be utilizing ndk 23 now
[15:29:38] <hyrcanus> i run ffmpeg on aarch64
[15:29:49] <hyrcanus> oh android.  neevermind.
[15:30:29] <hardcoresushi> JEEB: I can compile with NDK 23 but only when enabling "--disable-asm"
[15:31:10] <JEEB> I don't see anything regarding FFmpeg being poked when the toolchain was bumped https://github.com/mpv-android/mpv-android/commit/9f4751e3c9b7d8860eb608a58086ee289733698c#diff-e9ee322d62b4dbc8a1d7de484a759b807225c4c170830dfc010e5f28fc6996da
[15:31:41] *** Joins: Flabb (~Flabb@89.169.42.92)
[15:31:47] <JEEB> and the FFmpeg process doesn't really have much special https://github.com/mpv-android/mpv-android/blob/master/buildscripts/scripts/ffmpeg.sh
[15:31:59] <JEEB> only 32bit intel gets disable-asm
[15:32:36] <JEEB> which is expected since android requires position independent stuff which strips you from the ability of utilizing all the registers
[15:33:06] <JEEB> (which in 32bit mode were limited on x86)
[15:34:07] <hardcoresushi> JEEB: It seems mpv uses shared libraries. I use static libraries, can it be the issue ?
[15:34:59] <JEEB> it may, although I'd be surprised personally in this specific case
[15:35:13] <JEEB> I'd be more pointing towards the build root having some leftovers or something else like that
[15:35:53] <hardcoresushi> Also, every errors I get seem to only concern fft_float.o
[15:40:25] <JEEB> just make sure you get those when the build root is clear (like if you have a xyz_build dir from which you call the FFmpeg configure script, you may just clear that once and then try again)
[15:41:00] <JEEB> but all I can see is that mpv-android doesn't disable filters and that fft code is being utilized in at least two filters right now
[15:41:01] <hardcoresushi> JEEB: just did a fresh build. I checked there was no .o files in the root folder but I still get the same errors.
[15:41:26] <JEEB> so in theory the configure line utilized should be having that code built
[15:41:41] <JEEB> if you believe it's a static|shared issue I think then it's quite quick for you to test
[15:42:47] <hardcoresushi> I will test to use shared libraries

[20:48:58] <aphysically> I guess following an intention to be used for high resolutions? (re: hevc)
[20:49:17] <JEEB> yea, so you can code a single color larger block more cheaply
[20:49:26] <JEEB> (or the split it into smaller regions
[20:49:39] <JEEB> I think the optimization between those two is what's hard for newer formats
[20:49:50] <JEEB> since when you have large blocks, they can look real cheap n' maybe good PSNR even
[20:49:55] <JEEB> but then you get blooooor

[20:50:22] <JEEB> and other newer formats
[20:50:31] <JEEB> since writing that cost benefit analysis is hard

[21:48:59] <aphysically> oof I need to come up with a workaround for SRT startup
[21:49:22] <aphysically> if for some reason ffmpeg is slow to start encoding the connection will die
[21:49:39] <aphysically> this can happen for any subtitles for example; I workaround this by extracting subtitles to a separate temporary file

[23:16:47] <smfs33> I have a question about filepaths for subtitles on windows. Is it possible to use absolute paths at all? I'm having trouble finding the right format. I keep getting variatons of this error "[Parsed_subtitles_0 @ 000002201db4a7c0] Unable to open "c:\Users\jakob\Documents\projects\quickstrim\in.mkv""
