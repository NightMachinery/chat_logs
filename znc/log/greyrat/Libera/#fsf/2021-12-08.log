[07:47:50] <DiffieHellman> I dunno, but the OSI seems to accept is as an "open source" license somehow.
[07:47:51] <nckx> ‘University of Victoria’.
[07:48:22] <nckx> DiffieHellman: Yeah, weird at first glance, no?  Although I'm not familiar with OSI's acceptance criteria at all.
[07:50:07] <DiffieHellman> Here is the acceptance criteria; https://opensource.org/docs/osd They don't seem to solidly follow the criteria for some inane reason though.
[07:50:19] <tpefreedom> Doesn't the open source definition used by the OSI )not sure exactly what tho) include licenses that disallow commercial use?
[07:50:33] <nckx> In fact https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_Public_License says ‘FSF approved’, although a super-lazy cursory Web search didn't turn up evidence.
[07:51:01] <nckx> So that's a big 🤷 from me on understanding licencing once more :)

[07:52:22] <DiffieHellman> The FSF does not list the Adaptive Public License in their license list as mentioned above.
[07:52:32] <nckx> Uhuh.
[07:53:41] <tpefreedom> I'm running a benchmark on my android phone to see just how underpowered (or maybe not) it is.
[07:54:46] <nckx> I wonder if it's some weird templating artefact: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adaptive_Public_License&diff=1059206135&oldid=1032641870
[07:55:22] <nckx> That's the edit that supposedly introduces ‘FSF approved: Yes’ without actually mentioning FSF anywhere in the diff?
[07:55:49] <nckx> ‘Free Software = Yes’ = alias?
[07:56:10] <DiffieHellman> Hmm, Is there a page or email I can submit a new license onto the page?
[07:56:30] <DiffieHellman> licensing@fsf.org huh. Might send em an email.
[07:56:42] <anton> what license do you want to submit?
[07:57:35] <DiffieHellman> The Adaptive_Public_License being discussed.
[08:02:02] * nckx reverted false FSF claim on Wikipedia…

[20:17:21] <AndrewYu> Not the worst thing ever since go-to-the-school tests are still supported. What is unacceptable is our government requiring the use of proprietary software in COMPULSORY education. (https://aveniracademia.org/2021/10/20/education.html is what I wrote on that.) By the way, do you think of US courts requiring Zoom to be unconstitutional?
[20:19:25] <kompowiec> when I was in compulsory education and it was literally the beginning of remote education, I used email and electronic journal.
[20:19:48] <kompowiec> I have not been forced by my schools to use non-free software
[20:20:04] <kompowiec> (unless non-libre JS i guess)
[20:20:23] <AndrewYu> That's nice
[20:20:28] <GNUHacker> nice
[20:21:33] <kompowiec> although there were links to skype and other junk in the electronic log but i just didn't use them.
[20:22:07] <AndrewYu> We're forced to use Tencent Meetings and (ofc) WeChat. Has a lot to do with Chinese culture of being conservative and ******* collectivism (started really appearing from the Ming dynasty as I read)

[20:24:18] <kompowiec> extreme individualist here
[20:24:24] <AndrewYu> <Teacher> Freedom of choice isn't applicable when you're under 18
[20:24:57] <AndrewYu> <Andrew> No, the const says that I can't sign a contract cuz I'm under 18, but I do have the right to decline them
[20:25:00] <kompowiec> the ideology of equality in school is extremely toxic.

[20:26:04] <AndrewYu> <Andrew> *redirects what the teacher says to /dev/null*
[20:27:12] <kompowiec> ultimately it can be said that non-free software doesn't work on your computer (because you use trisquel or something)
[20:27:20] <AndrewYu> Fun fact: I'm trying to construct a mathematical way to limit the powers of, ugh, the power with group theory
[20:28:05] <AndrewYu> Hyperbola to be exact, yeah. Then they said I have to INSTALL SOME "SANE" OPERATING SYSTEM, WHICH THEY MENTIONED WINDOWS. 
[20:28:17] <AndrewYu> I'm like, my computer isn't powerful enough.
[20:28:51] <kompowiec> it's also a good option.
[20:29:25] <nomagno> I'm fairly sure nonfree software DOES work on Trisquel
[20:29:55] <AndrewYu> that is, if you really want to
[20:30:36] <AndrewYu> try paru/yay -S zoom-bin on hyper/parabola. In conflict with your-freedom which is a dependency of `base'. Try to remove that, yay!
[20:31:39] <nomagno> I honestly don't care about using nonfree software, I care about clearly knowing when I am using free and when I am using nonfree software
[20:31:41] <kompowiec> nomagno, iirc linux-libre kernel on trisquel block non-free firmware, not necessarily non-free software but I don't think a non-technical person would understand the difference.
[20:31:48] <nomagno> And I find Debian to be very good for this
[20:33:28] <AndrewYu> And I couldn't get out of that. (as a not emotionally strong person who is in 2ndary school) I remember crying at 2AM thinking about the dystopian reality you-know. At last got over school by pacstrapping stuff into a mount bind, learning how Xorg works, forwarding the X client of Zoom inside, making it unable to touch my stuff. Simple containers don't separate the kernel though.
[20:35:20] <AndrewYu> But that still left me very uncomfortable. (1) the overeach of collectivism (2) because I lied that I accept the EULA, which I obviously don't, and that has unforseeable effects on my future, legal-wise and mentally.  
[20:35:29] <kompowiec> Nowadays, free software exists for almost any task. The problem is to convince people to do so.
[20:35:38] <AndrewYu> Good night, 1 AM here. School tomorrow. Glad that it's IRL school.
[20:35:52] <kompowiec> bb
[20:36:18] <nomagno> Debian clearly and thoroughly separates out free, nonfree and free-with-nonfree-dependencies software. I honestly don't want to be babysitted when installing packages, just informed

[20:37:34] <nomagno> For example, I can tell you the only nonfree package I have on my system right now is a single nonfree Nvidia blob, because I ran into too many performance issues otherwise.
[20:37:53] <nomagno> This is what I want an OS to do. Inform me, not block me
[20:38:08] <AndrewYu> I usually sacrifice performance for FS
[20:38:13] <AndrewYu> *doesn't sleep yet*
[20:39:23] <kompowiec> my only non-free software on my PC it's probably just skype. I use free version for my wifi broadcom
[20:40:02] <AndrewYu> kompowiec: I recently convinced a classmate to switch from SPSS to R, which I liked ofc. Convincing people to use GNU/Linux was very hard. I recently found Deepin to be a good entry point for the Chinese. It is not completely FS (driver blobs, and the default installation of Sogou Chinese Input, and the App Store that includes WeChat and Tencent Meetings and stuff), but it's at least better than using
[20:40:04] <AndrewYu> Windows. The reason why they didn't switch is because of games, which is a not insane but pretty lame reason to me.
[20:41:03] <AndrewYu> nomagno: If I maintain a repo/dist, I won't block installation of nonfree software. I just won't include it in the repos.
[20:41:13] <kompowiec> ironically, people will think the solution to the linux gaming problem is steam.
[20:42:06] * AndrewYu has no idea of how steam works
[20:42:37] <AndrewYu> I mean, sometimes I mess up monoids in minetest, sometimes I stall in Flightgear, that's it. No nonfree games.
[20:43:33] <AndrewYu> Btw, I am actually reconsidering my use of the GPL due to me agreeing with https://unixsheikh.com/articles/the-problems-with-the-gpl.html. I'd love to hear people's thoughts on this.
[20:44:49] <kompowiec> tldr; steam it's DRM
[20:45:10] <nomagno> Selling people the fact switching to fully free operating systems is of interest is very hard for much the same reason selling free software itself in a traditional (dumb) way is hard
[20:45:42] <kompowiec> > The GPL is hypocritical
[20:45:44] <kompowiec> oh sweet
[20:46:04] <AndrewYu> nomagno: If you're referring to compatibility, I don't think that's the case w/ Deepin for Chinese users w/ productivity software
[20:46:15] <kompowiec> when people learn that appeal to hypocrisy doesn't work. Never.
[20:46:59] <AndrewYu> Well true, but the point is made well
[20:48:06] <kompowiec> Is not. If I say you shouldn't smoke and still smoke, but I smoke, it doesn't refute the notion that you shouldn't smoke.
[20:48:13] <AndrewYu> I don't like it when people think that commercial \equiv proprietary

[20:51:21] <nomagno> The GPL is, effectively, a noncommercial license. At least as far as most traditional software developer corporations are concerned
[20:51:45] <nomagno> The larger issue is selling digital tokens as if they were physical resources that take money to copy, is DUMB
[20:51:58] <kompowiec> recently in my store there was an information on not to buy more than you need during these holidays. I guess it's a slight suggestion that they have a supply problem, but they've wrapped it up in a savings slogan. Free software desperately needs good marketing.
[20:52:07] <nomagno> I blame copyright, companies, and the GPL, and everyone else
[20:52:20] <AndrewYu> Yeah. The Internet is causing issues lol
[20:52:25] <GoatAvenger> Screw business and making money with software.  The government and private sector are perfectly capable of paying good money to good developers for good software if that was their interest; but, it's not.  Their interest is in world domination.
[20:52:32] <nomagno> Ideas, binaries, source code, and the rest of copyright idiosyncrasies are NOT something you can own
[20:52:48] <AndrewYu> kompowiec: I believe so
[20:53:07] <GoatAvenger> Their interest is in exploitation, and profit at the expense of other's ignorance.  plain, and, simple
[20:53:08] <nomagno> Property is defined around scarcity

[20:54:04] <kompowiec> china is best proof that IP it's suicide
[20:54:30] <davisr> nomagno: It's entirely possible to make a living selling free software. If the software has a low-cost and trusted developer, most people will get it from its canonical source. Elsewhere, distributing copies serves as good marketing (i.e. "it's so good, it's worth sharing")
[20:54:31] <AndrewYu> kompowiec: I don't understand though I live there
[20:55:16] <kompowiec> AndrewYu, from what I understand China has a completely different IP model and they copy almost every Western technology.
[20:55:20] <nomagno> davisr: Yes, it is indeed possible to make a living. I think selling software in the first place is dumb tough
[20:55:43] <AndrewYu> kompowiec: That has more to do w/ patents than copyright, but yes. Patents aren't international
[20:55:56] <kompowiec> meanwhile western self flagellates itself with its own copyright law.
[20:55:59] <GoatAvenger> If you make a good software product, a good movie, a good book; generally, decent people, will pay for it, even if it's free world work.  But a cultured society where decency abounds, requires that you treat people with decency, we still have a lot to learn on how to do that.
[20:56:08] <nomagno> And my original point was that the GPL makes the tradition software business model of "let's pretend this binary costs money to copy" impossible

However, many people believe that e.g. The Medicine Industry should have IP stuff since it's really a big investment to develop meds, while intuitively software is on the other extreme.

[21:04:49] <nomagno> Piracy IS theft, BECAUSE intellectual property IS property. Let's rephrase: copying things that don't cost money to copy around IS moving things that cost money to copy around, BECAUSE the right to limit how people share ideas IS the right to control scarce goods
[21:05:09] <GoatAvenger> Patents are okay, and make sense, if used the way they were intended, and sanely.  Same with copyright; but, copyright lasting 100+ years is beyond insanity..

[21:05:46] <AndrewYu> By the way, why are books so expensive in the US and elsewhere? Something that I expect to be able to buy for 20$ costs something like 200$ in the US. The same with medical care, which I understand as a medicaid problem. 
[21:06:02] <davisr> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#IntellectualProperty 
[21:06:13] <kompowiec> nomagno, so it only makes sense from the perspective of the person who believes that IP makes sense? Do I understand it correctly?
[21:06:38] <AndrewYu> davisr: \forall "Intellectual Property" \in this
[21:07:03] <AndrewYu> -context = \set{Copyright, patents}
[21:07:09] <nomagno> kompowiec: the "piracy is theft" statement only make sense if you don't understand the difference between an intellectual monopoly and the exchange of scarce goods
[21:07:14] <AndrewYu> Patents? To me they're like: I invented this thing first, so you don't get to use it unless you get it from me
[21:07:41] <White_Flame> nomagno: eh, it's not theft.  You're not stealing the right to copy from the IP holder.  You're violating their copy right.
[21:07:50] <White_Flame> the copyright itself is the property
[21:08:02] <GoatAvenger> AndrewYu, say I invented a novel machine of great use; a patent would help protect me with time, to get it to market, before a large mega corporation can steal the plans and outproduce me before I even draw up the final draft
[21:08:07] <AndrewYu> We're kindof using "IP" sarcastically, since at least I believe that that isn't property
[21:08:41] <GoatAvenger> AndrewYu, but what happens, is corporations use armies of lawyers and paper pushing strongmen, to control that whole ecosystem, so now it works only in their favor.  At least as far as my limited understanding of the issue goes
[21:08:46] <AndrewYu> GoatAvenger: In reality they get (ab)used by the large mega corporations first. Rethinking patents might make it better tho
[21:08:56] <GoatAvenger> AndrewYu, yeah, exactly
[21:09:16] <AndrewYu> Ah yes. Legal system <=> compete w/ each other on how much money you have to get good lawyers
[21:09:20] <GoatAvenger> Patents and copyright work against the people; originally, they were there to protect the little guy
[21:09:28] <kompowiec> nomagno, ESR in their book "The Hacker Milieu as Gift Culture" says (more or less) just as "capitalism" is the natural, peaceful, voluntary way of determining who can do something with limited physical resources, so is "gift culture" a natural, peaceful, voluntary way of determining who can do something with digital technology or with an infinitely copyable resource.

[21:10:59] <Noisytoot> nomagno, "Intellectual property" is NOT property. You cannot own information and it costs nothing to distribute it.
[21:10:59] <AndrewYu> People don't get rich because of hard work, people get rich because they were lucky before birth (mostly).
[21:11:11] <GoatAvenger> clearly our only recourse is to start a new country on the plastic island in the pacific, and fix all these broken ultra bourgeouse laws
[21:11:20] <GoatAvenger> heh

[21:13:52] <White_Flame> Noisytoot: IP is not about owning information.  IP is about owning rights about the information's distribution

[21:19:51] <Noisytoot> White_Flame, What's the difference?
[21:20:03] <White_Flame> getting the details right when arguing things
[21:20:16] <Noisytoot> Restricting the distribution of information is restricting freedom of expression.
[21:20:30] <White_Flame> claiming that ownership of information is invalid is correct, but equating IP with that is not a valid takedown of IP
[21:20:58] <White_Flame> right, the effects that those rights bring undermine the "noble" intended purposes of IP
[21:21:03] <GoatAvenger> Capitalism isn't really a system, as far as I understand it.  It's more of just an observation of human nature.  The problem, as my guess, would be, lack of proper checks and balances.  That's why democracy was invented, to put checks and balances on power; we've probably failed to properly do that for business, such that the power of business has over-powered and corrupted the rules of governing.
[21:21:16] <White_Flame> GoatAvenger: correct, it's a back-labeled concept
[21:23:10] <GoatAvenger> The real problem we all faced, was briefly flirted with in the 1950's and 1960's: consciousness and human nature.  And how we handled that was with MKUltra and Wood Stock.  lol
[21:23:18] <GoatAvenger> We've got some figuring out to do still.
[21:23:25] <White_Flame> naturally, you have family-sized cooperation and burden sharing; you have trade (which can be free or coersive); and domination at play in natural behavior
