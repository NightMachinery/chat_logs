[02:32:15] <greybot> JayDoubleu: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem -- "I want to do X, but I'm asking how to do Y..."
[02:32:25] *** Joins: katsuragi (katsuragi@tilde.institute)
[02:34:01] <JayDoubleu> emg: ehh. I'm trying to run command on golang using `cmd := exec.Command("bash -c mycommand")`
[02:34:05] <emg> JayDoubleu: 1) no need to call bash to call ls 2) you shouldn't ever use ls except in interactive usage 3) why do the quotes come into play?
[02:34:15] <JayDoubleu> so I always get the return code
[02:34:20] <emg> JayDoubleu: ah! awesome! yeah you don't need bash, one sec
[02:34:46] <emg> JayDoubleu: but also: why ls? please please tell me you're not going to parse the output from ls
[02:34:48] <emg> !ls
[02:34:48] <greybot> DO NOT USE ls' output for anything. ls is a tool for interactively looking at directory metadata. Any attempts at parsing ls' output with code are broken. Globs are much more simple AND correct: ''for file in *.txt''. Read http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs
[02:35:07] <emg> JayDoubleu: if it's for a log... ok, but if you're doing anything with that file list, use a native go approach
[02:36:09] <JayDoubleu> emg: its just an example of passing parameters. this cmd is passed to pty.Start() if there is no command in path it will throw error so cmd will not have any return code I can grab
[02:36:15] <emg> JayDoubleu: that being said, you don't exec a command + flags like that in go, give "ls" as one arg and "-laht" as another: https://pkg.go.dev/os/exec#Command
[02:36:44] <JayDoubleu> emg: yes. just another example.
[02:36:49] <emg> JayDoubleu: I'd highly recommend taking this to the go irc channel, I think it's #go-nuts
[02:36:51] <e36freak> JayDoubleu: #go-nuts sounds like a better channel, and don't ask assuming bash -c, ask straight up what you want to do
[02:36:54] <e36freak> yeah
[02:37:15] <emg> yeah go specifically decided NOT to use a shell to execute external programs for good reason

[15:06:16] <podeni> Hi everyone. I'm curious, what character replacement regex could I use (sed? perl?) to merge all lines that don't begin with a double quote with the above line, if the above line doesn't end with a double quote? (use case: It's a CSV with multiline-cells that I want to collapse.
[15:06:50] <podeni> something like replace [^"]\n[^"] with $1 $2
[15:06:54] *** Joins: maledictium (~crux@bl23-232-57.dsl.telepac.pt)
[15:08:56] <twkm> i suggest #perl or #sed.
[15:09:43] <podeni> Cool, thanks!
[15:10:15] <twkm> bash can possibly do it, slowly.
[15:10:32] <NRK[m]> feel like it's a job better suited for awk
[15:10:39] <geirha> gawk -v RS='"\n' '{gsub(/\n/, " "); print $0 "\""}'
[15:11:14] <geirha> also doable with awk, but a bit longer
[15:11:59] <geirha> (posix doesn't define what happens when RS is longer than one char)
[15:13:27] <grawity> I would suggest that the correct, if a bit longer, method is: python -c "import csv, sys; csv.writer(sys.stdout).writerows([cell.replace('\n', ' ') for cell in row] for row in csv.reader(sys.stdin))"

All other variable names should be lowercase.

[16:18:58] <Soliton> whatever string processing you do you should do it either in sed or in shell. not mixing the two.

[16:22:08] <Soliton> and if you mean you want to inject $CHANGELOG into sed code then yes of course.
[16:22:13] <jsbach> Soliton, sed says  unterminated `s' command if i pipe it to sed
[16:22:30] <Soliton> show the actual sed call.
[16:23:07] <jsbach> Soliton, VERSION=$(echo "$CHANGELOG" | sed -e 's/^\([1-9][0-9]*\).*/\1/')
[16:23:34] <Soliton> no matter what the input is it can't possible make the sed call a syntax error...
[16:23:41] <geirha> if you inject it into sed, sed is likely to produce that error, but not when just feeding it to sed's stdin
[16:23:42] <Soliton> input is input not sed code.
[16:24:03] <Soliton> again that sed code is not even 53 characters long.
[16:24:18] <geirha> find the sed command that is actually printing that error message. The one you pasted is not it
[16:25:06] <Soliton> or show the whole script so we can remove the echo|sed non-sense.

[16:58:46] <Soliton> the alleged shell injection might involve bash.

[21:57:12] <greybot> Set up your environment (PATH, LANG, EDITOR, ...) in ~/.bash_profile. Set up your bash shell (PS1, functions, shopts, ...) in ~/.bashrc. Then source .bashrc from .bash_profile. See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles>. For GUI logins, SEE YOUR DOCUMENTATION or ask your OS channel because they're all different and we don't know.
[21:57:18] <irc_user> I see, thanks. I'm on MacOS so IIRC it's backwards for whatever reason.

[21:58:24] <e36freak> it's not backwards, when you open a terminal it's just a login shell
[21:58:33] <e36freak> .bash_profile would still be the place to put it
[21:58:41] <tirnanog> yeah, I was going to say. I'm pretty sure Term.app invokes a login shell.

[22:01:47] <tirnanog> does the file not exist in your case?
[22:05:15] <irc_user> It does, I swear there was a reason I put some exports in the bashrc instead of profile, but I guess I can't count on my past self to not be an idiot so I'll move it to bash_profile haha
[22:05:43] <OMGOMG> profile is only read on login, so if you frequently add paths, you might consider doing it otherwisely

[22:08:38] <tirnanog> that's not true. Apple's terminal invokes a login shell, as was discussed above. and macOS doesn't care about either of ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile upon logging in.

[22:10:08] <tirnanog> graphically, that is. but if you were to login via, say, ssh, you'd also get a login shell.
[22:10:13] <irc_user> Is there any practical reason other than convention to not just dump everything into bash_profile on MacOS then?
[22:11:14] <irc_user> Ah, I should read that wiki link before asking.
[22:11:16] <tirnanog> yes. there might conceivably be situations in which you start bash as an interactive, non-login shell. in that case, you might appreciate that your interactive-tweaking parts are in .bashrc.
[22:11:42] <irc_user> I see, thank you
[22:12:08] <tirnanog> I mean, might not be something you do regular, but the principle could still apply to your platform.

[22:15:05] <tirnanog> incidentally, you could use .profile instead of .bash_profile. some of us here do that, because it then benefits other sh implementations. in that event, you would need to guard the sourcing of .bashrc. for example: if [ "$BASH" ] && [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi
[22:17:21] <irc_user> Ah so if someone uses zsh as well for example, they wouldn't have to write a zprofile?
[22:17:30] *** Joins: Atque (~Atque@user/atque)
[22:17:51] <tirnanog> not sure about zsh. I don't think it reads .profile normally. but dash would, for example, along with many others.
[22:18:21] <tirnanog> ah, I'm wrong. zsh does indeed read .profile.
[22:19:00] <tirnanog> but only in its supposed sh/ksh compatibility modes, apparently. makes sense.
