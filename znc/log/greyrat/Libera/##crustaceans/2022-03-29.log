[16:12:54] <gerikson> its ally  Azerbaijan is eyeing the rest of Nagorno-Karabakh
[16:13:46] <Brekkjern> But I can imagine Turkey was added because the Soviet navy was rather powerful, and Turkey controlled the only warm-water port on the European side of Russia.
[16:15:06] <Brekkjern> That said, at that time they probably did control the Baltics, so I guess they could have used those ports?
