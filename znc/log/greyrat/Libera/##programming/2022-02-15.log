[00:00:02] <pyzozord> they can give you migranes and question your life choices and your inteligence
[00:00:17] <sonny> at my currency pace, I've done a chapter in 6 months ...
[00:00:36] <pyzozord> well K&R is fairly light weight in all honesty, there are a puzzle or two but mostly it's straightforward
[00:01:05] <sonny> k&r was well written, has good questions in there as well
[00:01:08] <user51> last few exercises in chapter 1 are harder if you limit yourself to what's been introduced

[00:01:40] <pyzozord> but I was very thorogh about it, I was reading the book, asking many questions in #c, doing every exercise, asking for reviews, asking more questions, reading the specification, reading other websites
[00:02:03] <pyzozord> then I did few projects in c including the terminal emulator and code editor I use every day
[00:02:15] <sonny> that's great, those are big projects

[02:27:19] <ProfSimm> apotheon: I'm wondering if this will improve legibility over a classic closure syntax
[02:27:37] <apotheon> ProfSimm: doubtful
[02:27:45] <apotheon> A classic closure is pretty clear.
[02:27:50] <ProfSimm> apotheon: fun_name: from (a, b, c) to (a * b * c * d) where (d: 20) vs  fun_name: (a, b, c) -> {d: 20; return a * b * c * d}
[02:28:14] <ProfSimm> apotheon: the "where" part is helpful though. Many functional languages do it
[02:28:19] <apotheon> the second example is more clear
[02:28:24] <ProfSimm> apotheon: that is, moving declatations after
[02:28:33] <mrig> the hash used for the nodes has been augmented if i'm not mistaken to a more complicated hash to generate, in which case just write one down on paper from time to time and check against that?
[02:28:39] <ProfSimm> apotheon: it's more clear because you're used to it, that's the hard part
[02:28:52] <apotheon> Moving declarations after it would be worse for comprehension by anyone who isn't a working mathematician, I think.
[02:29:18] <auge> mrig: you talking about github?
[02:29:40] <ProfSimm> apotheon: well, think about it like this: do you write classes in this order:   public properties, private properties, constructor, public methods, private methods
[02:29:53] <apotheon> I understand it pretty easily, but reading it is more work due to having to retroactively contextualize it, and most people who aren't working mathematicians would not be accustomed to it in the first place.

[02:37:05] <apotheon> ProfSimm: I don't usually write code in languages where I would use all those features of a class.  My most common cases are things more like where class variables are just class variables, and if you want to access them externally you need accessors.

[02:38:21] <apotheon> ProfSimm: Yes, I would have those three things.
[02:38:22] <xsperry> apotheon, in languages where you can define syntax both before and after function definition, most code base use latter syntax. if the function is short, as it usually is in funtional languages, it makes sense to first see the big picture, and then break it down into smaller, more detailed pieces after
[02:38:39] <ProfSimm> apotheon: and you write then in this order...?
[02:38:40] <oldlaptop> auge: git is *inherently* resilient to tampering with the repository, those commit hashes authenticate the entire history
[02:38:58] <ProfSimm> xsperry: precisely my goal

[03:00:49] <nomagno> I'd actually prefer them to be necessary to apply copyright to crap, you know
[03:01:07] <nomagno> It'd make the public domain be more easily approachable
[03:01:27] <nomagno> But Berne convention.
[03:01:29] <ProfSimm> nomagno: well they have the practical purpose of referring to the copyright owner and when they published. But when they last tweaked the source is less relevant I think
[03:02:05] <PlanckWalk> It's not an end date, it's a date range of revisions
[03:02:06] <nomagno> ProfSimm: Considering the copyright expiration is tied to the author's date, the year of publishing is kinda irrelevant nowadays
[03:02:16] <nomagno> author's death*
[03:02:41] <PlanckWalk> When a work is substantially updated, the changes are derived works and have their own copyright date.

[03:04:22] <_73> ok I understand now thanks

[03:06:28] <apotheon> If you have an older copy, you can show you extracted from the older copy. If you don't, you don't have evidence of copyright age in your favor.

[03:08:04] <apotheon> sure
[03:08:06] <PlanckWalk> Yep.  If someone derives from the older version that has entered the public domain, whether there's a newer version that isn't in the public domain doesn't make a difference.
[03:08:30] <PlanckWalk> But if someone republishes your *new* version, with *substantial* new work, then you can sue them.

[03:09:26] <ProfSimm> There are git hooks that update this stuff
[03:09:57] <PlanckWalk> It's not mandatory to put a date range on the new work, or indeed any date or copyright notices at all.  It just helps you if you need to due someone, since they can't claim innocent infringement.

[03:23:25] <Sqaure> clumsy,flawed and slow language plagued by Spring and just lack of progress. It takes 10 times the effort to make something solid it compared to say Haskell.
[03:23:43] <Sqaure> ..solid in it*
[03:23:59] <EdFletcher> have you tried (if you can) kotlin? 
[03:24:12] <tokerboker> i have not used spring for a long time
[03:24:19] <tokerboker> what does spring buy you over plain java?
[03:24:33] <tokerboker> (or i guess could you use java without spring?)
[03:24:58] <Sqaure> Kotlin makers motto: A less verbose java. And its just that, it doesnt offer anything more except maybe their handling of null which feels like half ass hack.

[03:25:47] <EdFletcher> Sqaure: yeah but less-verbose, when we're talking about java, is a pretty big win in and of itself! plus it's just more ergonomic overall. if you have to use the jvm, seems like it's a better way to maintain your sanity. 
[03:26:19] <tokerboker> i guess what are you trying to build.
[03:27:16] <tokerboker> i kinda like javascript for hobby projects
[03:27:25] <tokerboker> and ofcourse big frontend projects.

If I write a program using GPL software, militaries can use it to kill people!  (if I understood that correctly)
[04:35:50] <Hash> Dang.
[04:36:31] <dTal> I did actually ask a substantive question, which remains unanswered, which is how exactly a software license written by other people and used by other people for their own projects, and not enforced on you in any way, can possily infringe YOUR rights?
[04:36:31] <vdamewood> vrp2zqL7: *Using* GPL software, well, define 'using'.
[04:36:46] <apotheon> dTal: I said "I often encounter", not "from you, dTal".
[04:37:14] <dTal> Okay, well then I'm sorry.
[04:37:16] <apotheon> dTal: Meanwhile, you specified an "entitled attitude" about something I said.
[04:37:19] <apotheon> specifically
[04:37:21] <apotheon> okay
[04:37:23] <apotheon> forgiven
[04:37:27] <apotheon> thanks
[04:37:30] <vdamewood> vrp2zqL7: If your were to incorporate substantial portions of the GPL codebase, then yes. If you were to execute the program as part of your development process, then no. The GPL wouldn't apply to your code.

[04:41:41] <dTal> In a world where software copyright did not exist, perhaps we would have no need for the GPL either. Software would be a free for all.
[04:41:51] <dTal> However, we do not live in that world.

[04:42:18] <oldlaptop> dTal: We then arrive at a fundamental disagreement over whether the GPL is appropriate as means to that end
[04:42:37] <apotheon> what oldlaptop said
[04:42:57] <vdamewood> Hash: If you need more time to think about what you're typing and type a full thought, feel free to take a few moments. It makes it harder to follow the conversation when your text causes most of it to scroll past the screen.
[04:42:59] <dTal> To my mind, the GPL is a *counterweight* to proprietary software. A tool to construct a parallel ecosystem which the proprietary world cannot appropriate, in the same way that we cannot appropriate the proprietary world.
[04:43:03] <apotheon> The GPL is, in many ways, self-defeating.
[04:43:15] <Hash> vdamewood: now that's a reasonable obejction.
[04:43:20] <Hash> Something that can be worked with.
[04:43:35] <Hash> *nod* I'll try.
[04:43:52] <apotheon> It is essentially a weapon against closed source software development, but it's not a sniper rifle, and it's not a knife.  It's a nuclear weapon.  It catches a lot of innocent bystanders in the blast radius.
[04:44:07] <oldlaptop> dTal: All too parallel

[04:45:26] <apotheon> (Other things happened since then, but it was kind of a big stink for a couple weeks or so.)
[04:45:50] <dTal> Well, yes. Any proprietary company could do the same. That is precisely the issue that the GPL is designed to protect against.
[04:46:21] <vrp2zqL7> So, if I write a c program and compile it with GCC, I can share a closed-source version, own that, and place restrictions on that, vdamewood?  Sorry, I do not know if compiling C or C++ puts pieces in the derivative program.
[04:46:28] <apotheon> dTal: That doesn't justify it.
[04:46:44] <apotheon> "We're allowed to hurt our supposed allies becuase the enemy does, too."
[04:46:46] <dTal> You can't say you prefer permissive licensing, and then turn around all offended like when someone takes advantage of your permissive license.
[04:46:50] <oldlaptop> dTal: It is a rather bad look for a bunch of people who purport to oppose that sort of behavior to engage in it
[04:46:54] <apotheon> s/cuase/cause/
[04:47:16] <dTal> How did it hurt OpenBSD?
[04:47:16] <apotheon> dTal: I'm not being hypocritical.  I'm pointing out why I don't like *restrictive licensing*.
[04:47:39] <vdamewood> vrp2zqL7: For the take of this discussion, let's say that a compiler does not insert any code into the project, it just translates from C (or C++) to assembly or machine code. In that case, the GPL would have no effect on your proprietary code compiled with gcc.
[04:47:56] <oldlaptop> It didn't, it annoyed various OpenBSD people and OpenBSD-adjacent people, who percieved it as hypocritical.
[04:47:58] <apotheon> dTal: I'm allowed to dislike restrictive licensing, whether it claims to be restrictive for money or for "my own good".
[04:48:33] <apotheon> dTal: I take the position that it's best to follow a policy of "first, do no harm", not of "first, fuck my neighbors", basically.
[04:48:42] <dTal> This is essentially the paradox of tolerance, isn't it
[04:48:59] <dTal> this is absolutely the nub of the issue
[04:49:09] *** Joins: audio (~audio@user/audio)
[04:49:15] <apotheon> It's self-defeating.
[04:49:16] <vdamewood> vrp2zqL7: That being said, gcc actually does insert a shim into the final program to implement a function called _start that's called before main, and calls main itself, and other code to setup the C standard-library state, like malloc's allocation pool. There's an exception to the licensing for this code, that allows you to include it into a proprietary program.
[04:49:41] <flakland> it's only restrictive if you try to redistribute the combined work(s)
[04:49:56] <flakland> you might be thinking of AGPL
[04:50:02] <oldlaptop> flakland: The anti-GPL position is precisely that such a restriction is improper
[04:50:24] <dTal> But isn't *that* self defeating?
[04:50:25] <oldlaptop> (or rather that more or less *any* restriction is improper)
[04:50:38] <vdamewood> vrp2zqL7: That code is in a file called crt0.o, and is automatically linked into the final executable.
[04:50:39] <dTal> To not believe in the restriction from adding more restrictions?
[04:50:54] <dTal> The inevitable outcome of that is someone takes the code and adds more restrictions.
[04:50:55] <apotheon> dTal: I choose to encourage doing the right thing over discouraging doing the wrong thing.
[04:51:03] <apotheon> Those who will do the wrong thing will do the wrong thing, period.
[04:51:41] <apotheon> Those who wish to do the right thing, however, are being subjected to legal threats by those who claim to be their allies.
[04:51:42] <dTal> The GPL seems far more pragmatic to me. The only added restriction is against adding more restrictions. That seems philosophically pure as well.
[04:52:01] <dTal> I don't see how handing over code to "the enemy" should be considered noble.
[04:52:03] <vdamewood> dTal: Even the GPLv3 has some restrictions that are okay to add.

[04:53:23] <oldlaptop> GPL3 also adds restrictions that go beyond "no added restrictions!", or at least arguably do so
[04:53:36] <vrp2zqL7> I can understand why the four freedoms might have been put in place originally, but that was only a start and not an end because eventually those specific terms would be become manipulated.  Personally, if I were an advanced programmer and it was allowed, I would split my code into at least a few different forms: closed-source, open-source, permissive, open-to-read-but-not-modify, etc.

[04:55:39] <dTal> In fact, the FSF have been extraordinarily *un*-litigious, considering the amount of money they stand to gain from taking a hardline stance, considering the sheer number of GPL violations globally.
[04:55:40] <ProfSimm> I have a somewhat peculiar problem. I need to mark pure objects that contains impure objects as impure. But also permit objects to have encapsulated state. So they can hide if contains impure state. So uhmm

[04:55:55] <dTal> To a degree that frustrates me.

[04:57:05] <vdamewood> apotheon: "harmless" from the FSF perspective.
[04:57:05] <perro_> it's lost ground in the wild cause it's not pragmatic

[05:14:55] <chives> flakland, that is sad because the program has some basics for that but i think it really needs an understanding of the speakers because i think ive had clipping i couldnt hear and clipping i could here separate from the programs perpsective, they're cheap speakers tbh but i like them honestly mainly just passing the time maybe learning a thing or two along the way
[05:14:58] <apotheon> Try saying no and see what happens.

[05:15:32] <ProfSimm> apotheon: of course I'll say no to being caged or killed, the worst that could happen is they'll cage me or kill me.
[05:15:50] <Irishmanluke> oldlaptop: I understand that the state is equivalent to a local monopoly on force, it doesn't change the fact that noone is being killed for copying files

[05:16:02] <pulse> i don't really understand this idea that just because digital data is copyable, it's somehow not subject to the same proprietary rights as everything else
[05:16:18] <pulse> seems weird to me
[05:16:34] <pulse> copyright is a good mechanism
[05:16:36] <perro_> 1 file == 1 death penalty
[05:16:38] <perro_> 2 == 2
[05:16:45] <ProfSimm> pulse: reality is inconsistent because we filter it through our models and categories, and categories are subjective. Such as what's theft, what isn't and so on.
[05:16:46] <Irishmanluke> pulse: well now I'm going to sound like I'm contradicting myself but your intuitions are completely backwards
[05:16:47] <oldlaptop> pulse: "everything else" meaning data that does not happen to be stored digitally? or "everything else" meaning also physical property?
[05:17:00] <ProfSimm> pulse: but copying is not moving
[05:17:14] <ProfSimm> pulse: it's two different things. 
[05:17:17] <pulse> oldlaptop, i think the idea is that because digital data is copyable, it's not the same as a couch because you can't copy a couch as easily
[05:17:22] <oldlaptop> There is a very obvious category distrinction between information and physical property, and none (really) between information that happens to be stored on paper and information that happens to be stored on (say) magnetic media.
[05:17:24] <ProfSimm> Move semantics vs value semantics, yo
[05:17:31] <pulse> but to me that's backwards. if we're digitalizing the world, we need some sane concepts that hold it together
[05:17:31] <Irishmanluke> what profsimm said
[05:17:51] <perro_> some of yall syhould go to law school
[05:18:00] <pulse> oldlaptop, right, but does it make sense that someone shouldn't pay for a copy of, say, a game, that some studio spent millions on?
[05:18:09] <pulse> it's pretty obvious why copyright exists, to me
[05:18:11] <ProfSimm> perro_: I've the feeling you have and about to hit us with wisdom

[05:18:43] <flakland> chives, the program has processing built in?  you have to mess around with the parameters,  ratio/threshold/(hopefully)gain
[05:18:51] <vdamewood> I went to a law school once... to visit a friend.
[05:18:52] <Irishmanluke> well presumably in another world where copyright didn't exist the game studio would either find another business model or they simply would not exist

[05:20:04] <vdamewood> pulse: What are all your systems?
[05:20:05] <pulse> vdamewood, but apparently using glob is bad, output_directory is bad, and stripping is also bad
[05:20:12] <chives> flakland, thats why from my perspecticve was thinking there may be a simple way to just tap it forward over time slowly and allow the software to reclip it... not ideal but at least help it to recenter itself i guess
[05:20:24] <vdamewood> pulse: Yep, yep, and yep.

[05:20:50] <Decker> pulse you have some extra quotes but they're mostly harmless
[05:20:57] <pulse> vdamewood, i don't have access to that, so idk if it builds there
[05:21:02] <vdamewood> I still haven't read mostly harmless.
[05:21:05] <pulse> Decker, hmm, where
[05:21:17] <pulse> oh the ""'s ?
[05:21:20] <Decker> "${PROJECT_NAME}" e "src/*.cpp" "src/*.hpp" "src/*.h")
[05:21:34] <chives> since i dont think i can quickly do it I don't know what do yall think... since if the song is 4 minutes long or so the sound level is important for that song so i dont think i want to mess that up you know what i mean... i want to try and keep the stage i guess
[05:22:00] <chives> but every so often im noticing "damn, i cant hear again"
[05:22:04] <Decker> you only need the quotes if the value in the quotes has a space... if it get sutituted later like project_name it'll still just be 1 token to the target_link_librarys functin
[05:22:09] <vrp2zqL7> This might be going more into philosophy, ethics, and morality, but I would say time matters a bit.  Copying a NES game in 1990 is very different than thirty years later in the 2020s in my opinion especially since the old-style cartridges are not made anymore.
[05:22:12] <pulse> Decker, i see
[05:22:16] <pulse> not really a huge issue
[05:22:20] <Decker> no
[05:23:00] <chives> its not the end of the world just passing the time trying to avoid "real thoughts" i cant do anything about
[05:23:04] <vdamewood> I'd say keep the quotes since it ensures that the value is a single token to CMake, even if spaces are added later.

[05:31:46] <amigojapan> Good morning
[05:31:50] <vdamewood> Decker: the output directory is the location where it goes during build time. GNUInstallDirs affects install locations.
[05:32:06] <vdamewood> pulse: Okay.
[05:32:10] <Decker> ahh - fighting with that is counter productive vdamewood :) 
[05:32:20] <Irishmanluke> I used to be a libertarian in college so I'm familiar with the argument that using the government for basically anything is immoral because the government derrives it's power from force.  I think that while it's true on some level that the government derives its power from force in reality the image of someone being locked in a cage or shot tends to be misleading when in reality noone is 
[05:32:26] <Irishmanluke> worried about being locked in a cage or shot for copying a file
[05:32:30] <vdamewood> Decker: Not if you want to run your program on Windows for debugging.
[05:32:54] <Decker> what makes your idea of where things go any better than any other?  (that was my question for pulse too after his comment aoubt 'I put files in lots of places that *I* want' )
[05:33:05] <Decker> vdamewood that's what install() rules are for
[05:33:33] <vdamewood> Decker: Since windows lacks rpath, I have to stick the exe's and the dll's in the same directory in order to run them without installing.
[05:33:41] <vdamewood> Decker: And no, you do not install to debug your code.
[05:33:45] <amigojapan> Irishmanluke: if you don't rely on the government, then you can't even use the roads
[05:33:46] <Decker> so buld the instal target
[05:33:55] <Irishmanluke> lol
[05:33:55] <Decker> install only copies those things that changed
[05:34:00] <Irishmanluke> there are private roads
[05:34:11] <vdamewood> Install will stick them into c:\program files, no thanks.
[05:34:19] <pulse> from another chan pulse> the output directory i can justify because i want the executable in a separate dir where i can copy various related files in post
[05:34:34] <pulse> i think it's neat if it going into /bin/ and then i can have my own little post-build world there
[05:34:41] <amigojapan> Irishmanluke: yeah but the great majority are public roads, at least here
[05:34:45] <pulse> as opposed to if it just mixes at build root
[05:35:13] <Decker> vdamewood set CMAKE_INSTALL_DIR to output and then it goes to build/output
[05:35:34] <Irishmanluke> amigojapan: I think it's actually a non-trivial question whether or not you could have roads (or something equivalent or superior to roads) without the government building them
[05:35:47] <vdamewood> Decker: Also, installing will strip debug information on *nix.
[05:36:09] <Irishmanluke> you certainly could have some smaller roads built by private companies or citizens or home owners associations 
[05:36:11] <Decker> not if it's a debug build
[05:36:31] <pulse> why would you install a debug build
[05:36:39] <pulse> not that i fully grasp install, anyway
[05:36:49] <Irishmanluke> larger roads are harder 
[05:36:52] <vdamewood> pulse: Apparently Decker thinks you should install in order to debug your code.
[05:36:52] <pulse> on windows we have .msi for installing :P
[05:36:57] <pulse> ugh
[05:37:00] <amigojapan> Irishmanluke: I am left learning when it comes to government works
[05:37:01] <pulse> no, i wouldn't want that

[05:37:53] <pulse> so wtf is make install then for
[05:38:12] <vdamewood> Me neither. There are really two ways to handle this situation, either add the place where your DLL goes to your %PATH%, or build your .exe and your .dlls in the same location. I opted for the latter.

[06:24:07] <vrp2zqL7> After the last healthcare fiasco in the U.S., it is clear government should never be trusted with running or controlling healthcare, education, or social programs like promises of having money for people when they retire many decades later in my opinion.

[06:26:09] <Irishmanluke> I know the US system is bad simply because of the amount of money we spend on healthcare collectively compared to any other country

[06:27:05] <vdamewood> pulse: Because CMakeSetups makefiles and VC project files that update whenever CMake files are changed. If you add/remove files from the project, you *don't* change the CMake files to match and there's no way to detect the change. Instead, you get a file not found error for a deleted file, or you don't even touch the new source file.

[06:28:50] <PlanckWalk> weird*
[06:28:58] <pulse> vdamewood, don't you just run cmake again and it updates the vsproj?

[06:29:49] <pulse> vdamewood, well, i'm sure i'll figure it out during dev

[06:30:01] <pulse> so half of this stuff i have no intuition for
[06:30:10] <vdamewood> It's easy. Just don't use file(GLOB) for source files.

[06:53:22] <oldlaptop> The stack should generally grow towards the top - so either the top starts at 0 and moves towards n as you push things, or it starts at n and moves towards 0.

[12:26:46] <deniska> (and other llvm toolchain compilers as well)
[12:27:33] <deniska> vdamewood: the issue is not so much crosscompilation, but rather bootstrapping. Like how "nothing" you can start with and build a usable system out of that

[12:28:41] <vdamewood> Well, I bring up cross compiling as a solution to the bootstrap problem.
[12:29:04] <deniska> granted you can't really build, say, gcc, without access to some gcc, or maybe clang, and I doubt gcc is buildable with msvc?

[16:21:00] <mrig> The line between philosophy science and math is not so distinct, and also the naming of people as authors is not considered to be that important either, depending on sect though, the jains to attribute things to individuals more so now.

[16:23:42] <mrig> amigojapan: the main issue is that that which is learned is always done in a similar way, and more often than not those who see knowledge are not those who write it down.
[16:23:50] <Xeroine> are only negative binary signed magnitude numbers changed when converting to 1's component? like do positive ones stay the same always?

[22:11:41] <apotheon> oldlaptop: Shareholder votes are generally regarded as being about *how* to serve shareholder value, not *what value means* in too broad a sense.  The defensible act is the act that can be described in terms of (eventual) money.
[22:11:48] <nomagno> I go back to entropy

[22:11:56] <absentia> oldlaptop: sure
[22:11:59] <nomagno> The most stable arrangement for any single entity is the monopoly
[22:12:11] <apotheon> I'm not a lawyer either, but there it is.
[22:12:17] <absentia> what i was referring to there though is not a mandate of sociopathic behavior
[22:12:27] <absentia> but regulations that either benefit and solidify the position of the incumbents
[22:12:38] <absentia> or lack of regulation that allows corporations or large firms to take outsized risks
[22:12:44] <absentia> (usually with other people's money)
[22:13:16] <absentia> corporations have many incentives to act sociopathically
[22:13:19] <absentia> but it's not mandated by law
[22:13:22] <absentia> that's ridiculous
[22:13:23] <apotheon> absentia: It's not like the law says, literally, "thou shalt be sociopathic".  It says "serve shareholder value", and doing so in a defensible way involves sociopathic behavior.
[22:13:45] <nomagno> Corps naturally seek to dominate the market at any cost due to having been regulated by people that found personally benefitial. Your average citizen, however, is benefitted from a strong, active, 'breathing' regulatory framework that isn't overreached and keeps the market as diverse as possible.

[22:14:11] <pulse> i think corporations sacrifice a lot of profit for moral values too, you just don't see that because it's easier to focus on the negative
[22:14:15] <nomagno> It's also just EASIER for a single company to try to control everything

[22:18:20] <apotheon> which is also about profit
[22:18:21] <pulse> 1.4 billion is not pocket change
[22:18:30] <pulse> and they literally just get good PR out of it
[22:18:38] <absentia> flakland: it affects bond yields and pricing
[22:18:47] <apotheon> pulse: MS is well-known for "donating" things to get people hooked on its software.
[22:18:49] <absentia> which consequently affects how many people are willing to invest in equities
[22:18:53] <flakland> everything affects yields and pricing though
[22:18:54] <absentia> and particularly riskier high growth equities
[22:18:59] <flakland> is there a direct correlation you mean?
[22:19:00] <nomagno> pyzozord: I feel the need to derail this great discussion, but are you seriously considering making an IF/visual novel open world game?
[22:19:03] <pulse> apotheon, that's an argument in bad faith imo. you can twist it either way. i prefer the optimistic lookout
[22:19:13] <pyzozord> nomagno: you don't do good for sake of good. If you suggest doing good to corporate managers they snart at you
[22:19:33] <pyzozord> or whatever is called that uncontrollable exhale of air because you almost laughed
[22:19:44] <absentia> flakland: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to determine the federal funds target rate. As previously stated, this rate influences the effective federal funds rate through open market operations or by buying and selling of government bonds (government debt).(2) More specifically, the Federal Reserve decreases liquidity by selling government bonds, thereby
[22:19:46] <absentia> raising the federal funds rate because banks have less liquidity to trade with other banks. Similarly, the Federal Reserve can increase liquidity by buying government bonds, decreasing the federal funds rate because banks have excess liquidity for trade. 
[22:19:50] <pyzozord> and they look at you like you are from a different planet
[22:19:52] <absentia> from the same link
[22:19:55] <GeDaMo> pyzozord: snort
[22:19:56] <oldlaptop> pyzozord: I'd suggest the smart ones won't do that. (The rarity of smart ones is another issue.)
[22:19:59] <pulse> another obvious one is google could charge for their services, but they offer them for free, benefiting billions all over the world. again, you can twist that as a negative easily but i prefer to look at it as actual 'goodness'

[22:20:29] <apotheon> Google isn't doing this for good purposes.  It's doing it for advertising revenue.
[22:20:38] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: isn't snorting inhaling like drugs or something?
[22:20:42] <nomagno> pyzozord: That nose exhale happens to me both when I'm about to crack up laughing and when I'm trying not to slap you, I'd be scared of both in a manger :P
[22:20:51] <GeDaMo> pyzozord: it can go both ways :P

[22:21:13] <pulse> it's much harder to find the good perspective in it. as in, some people at google are actually good and actually want to make the world better
[22:21:24] <absentia> flakland: it becomes more expensive to take on debt (or more profitable to issue debt) if the fed rate increases

[22:46:01] <oldlaptop> pikapika: Blindly dumping in-memory data structures to disk is going to be even less space-efficient in most cases.

[23:11:36] <Sqaure> oldlaptop, i was interpreting it as sqlite schema + storage format served the same purpose as say xsd + xml. Maybe i misunderstood you?
[23:11:39] <oldlaptop> I would say in a general sense it's wiser to use the database, which gets you a well-specified and widely-understood file format, a declarative language for doing stuff with it, and a well-tested I/O layer with ACID semantics, than to write your own inferior replacement of all that stuff.
