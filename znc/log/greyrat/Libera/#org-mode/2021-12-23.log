[15:56:23] <gour> i've configured integration between neomutt and org-mode (based on https://github.com/stefanv/org-neomutt) which from the neomutt side uses: org-protocol://store-link?url=message://{message_id}&title={subject}{dt}
[15:57:03] <gour> otoh, i also configured mu4e and i like that it was easy to use org-capture template for creating org-mode tasks
[15:58:57] <gour> now, wonder if it is possible to use org-protocol-capture call instead to provide ability to use one of my predefined org-capture templates?
[15:59:37] <gour> mu4e is nice mailer, but one of the neomutt's advantages is that it has nntp support enabling one to use gmane-based mailing lists

[16:35:29] <konubinix> IIUC, in your neomutt setup, neomutt calls emacs to store links to messages using org-protocol-capture. Now, you want to store a link from a message as seen with mu4e as well and use org-protocol-capture to do so. Right?

[16:41:51] <gour> well, here is the script https://paste.centos.org/view/6de12d45 which creates org-link from the mutt for selected message. now i'd like to call org-capture instead to be able to use one of my predefined org-capture templates, so that i don't need to manually create TODO task in my org file, but just fill the template and get complete task, with TASKS, DEADLINE etc.

[17:17:50] <konubinix> gour: I see, so your question may be reduced to "is there a way to run an equivalent of 'M-x org-capture' from org-capture-protocol?", right?
[17:18:56] *** Joins: sangoma (~kabaka@41.190.135.117)
[17:19:06] <konubinix> And I suppose that you are not willing explicitly to use org-capture-protocol right? Remember that org-capture-protocol is mostly designed to be called from a browser.
[17:19:53] <konubinix> Here, because you can simply call a program, like it is done in your snippet, I would tend to simply run `emacsclient -e '(org-capture)'`
[17:21:01] <konubinix> Because you run this from inside neomutt, I suppose you want to do something more complicated than just org-capture, you would want to get some information from the message from which you call org-capture
[17:21:49] <konubinix> With emacsclient, you have whatever behavior you want at hand, because you simply call an emacs function. So you an craft whatever emacs function does whatever behavior makes sense to you 
[17:23:25] <konubinix> Like in the example, the message_id, the subject and the date are given
[17:27:40] <konubinix> Oh, I think I understand. You want to use a template that gets some data from the context, like %a. But you want that context to be filled using neomutt contexts instead of the current point
[17:28:11] <konubinix> I guess this is what your mu4a workflow looks like. You select a template that contains some placeholder like %a, right?
[17:28:57] <konubinix> And then M-x org-capture -> select the template -> the placeholders of the task are already filled with some data relative to the mail you were looking at
[17:29:52] <konubinix> And ideally, you want to use the same capture templates for mu4a and for neomutt?
[17:32:05] *** Joins: bsd4me (~bsduser@user/bsd4me)
[17:44:18] <gour> konubinix: exactly, i possibly just want to use neomutt instead of mu4e and get same/similar behaviour when it comes with org-mode integration
[17:47:37] <konubinix> In my mind, this is not possible without changing the templates
[17:48:24] <konubinix> Placeholders like %a are evaluated from what buffer/mode/point you are in when running org-capture
[17:48:47] <konubinix> It would make little sense to use %a and want to provide some context from outside of emacs
[17:49:17] <gour> i understand, here is my org-capture template: https://paste.centos.org/view/44edcd93
[17:50:04] <konubinix> This template contains indeed the %a placeholder
[17:53:11] <konubinix> Hmmm, actually, I can see from org-capture code that %a use whatever you put in the :annotation property
[17:53:20] <konubinix> And defaults to capturing the link
[17:54:17] <konubinix> http://ix.io/3JfA
[17:54:24] <konubinix> see how it construct the annotation at the beginning?
[17:54:36] <konubinix> And I can also see that org-protocol uses the annotation property
[17:55:07] <konubinix> My bad, org-protocol is not suitable for your use case
[17:56:34] <konubinix> Anyway, you should be able to populate org-store-link-plist before calling org-capture to provide whatever link makes sense to you 
[17:57:05] <konubinix> Something like emacsclient -e '(let ((org-store-link-plist something)) (org-capture))'
[17:59:17] <gour> konubinix: ok, will try it!
[18:00:55] <konubinix> This works for me ->
[18:00:56] <konubinix> emacsclient -e "(let ( (org-capture-link-is-already-stored t) (org-store-link-plist '(:annotation \"something\")) ) (org-capture) )"
[18:01:17] <konubinix> Then I select a template that contains %a, then %a is substituted with "something"
[18:01:29] <konubinix> Up to you to decide what this something should be in the context of neomutt
[18:04:52] * gour nods

[18:08:43] <konubinix> I see you use %:subject in the template as well
[18:09:10] <konubinix> Simply add it to org-store-link-plist and you should be ok
[18:10:19] <konubinix> I've added the template you shared above
[18:10:31] <konubinix> And calling emacsclient -e "(let((org-capture-link-is-already-stored t)(org-store-link-plist '(:subject \"somesubject\" :annotation \"something\")))(org-capture))"
[18:10:48] <konubinix> And then selecting the template "e" manually in the org capture screen
[18:10:49] <konubinix> I get
[18:11:06] <konubinix> http://ix.io/3JfE
[18:11:35] <konubinix> So I guess it does what you want
[18:13:15] <konubinix> Actually, by looking more closely at the code of org-protocol, this is close to what is done there. They also set org-capture-link-is-already-stored to t and fill the org-store-link-plist before calling org-capture
[18:14:47] <konubinix> The main difference is that they don't allow for any type of plist in org-store-link-plist (hence you cannot provide a %:subject with org-protocol), they use org-link-store-props to fill it (I don't know if it matters) and they provide a default template
[18:15:35] <konubinix> Note that because the template is got from that code
[18:15:36] <konubinix> 	 (template (or (plist-get parts :template)
[18:15:36] <konubinix> 		       org-protocol-default-template-key))
[18:16:35] <konubinix> Then you could actually make the template selection interractive by setting org-protocol-default-template-key to nil, which is the default
[18:17:03] <konubinix> But I don't feel like I want to try this out, as I don't like org-protocol much and don't want to spend much time in it
[18:17:50] <konubinix> I'd rather run a emacs json/http server to communicate with a browser application and emacsclient to communicate with a non browser application
[18:18:28] <konubinix> But that is of course a matter of taste
[18:20:18] <konubinix> Anyway, I hope that helped :-)
[18:20:23] <gour> hmmm...mayb e it would be easier/simpler to just use mu4e ðŸ˜„
[18:20:35] <gour> btw, what is your mailer?
[18:20:47] <konubinix> Haha. It would be much simpler not using emacs in the first place :-P
[18:21:32] <gour> heh, the other day i read one article in regard: https://jonathanbartlett.co.uk/2020/10/28/emacs-fatigue.html
[18:21:54] <gour> when  investigating whether to settle on evil mode or just use plain bindings
[18:21:56] <konubinix> If you stick with emacs, I think you will end up thinking that most things are easily doable with a bit of elisp
[18:22:43] <konubinix> Last time I said that, I was asked to show how to make SPC SPC run some command while letting SPC insert a space
