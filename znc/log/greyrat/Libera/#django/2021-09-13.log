[01:16:13] <llanhmod> serious question, right now i'm in development, and have the default django secret insecure-qay inside the settings.py file on my github. What I want to know is 1) do i add the settings.py file to .gitignore and 2) i would use and .env in production for such a real key, right?
[01:17:22] <llanhmod> might be something on the site about this, haven't look yet, honestly. (doing so now)
[01:18:08] <dodo> the secret be should be secret. how you accomplish that is up to you
[01:18:18] <llanhmod> dodo: fair enough
[01:18:25] <dodo> i wouldn't exclude the settings file though as it's probably central to the project
[01:18:34] <llanhmod> okay
[01:18:42] <llanhmod> that's what I was really wondering...normally
[01:18:47] <dodo> in my case the secret is written to the settings during deployment
[01:18:55] <llanhmod> normally i handle the secret with a .env file
[01:21:11] <llanhmod> is that a real secret or the default django one?
[01:21:58] <dodo> is there a default one? i thought django generates a random one.. no idea tbh, i always add my own anyway
[01:22:27] <llanhmod> i suppose it is randomly generated.... just noticed it today.

[01:40:48] <GinFuyou> Yes, it's randomly generated. You can usually safely change it during development. Notably it invalidates sessions and password reset token I believe

[02:09:58] <GinFuyou> Please, just ask
[02:10:08] <hmx-12> okay! then i'll ask. sorry haha
[02:12:55] <hmx-12> uhh, basically i'm running a translation project for a game! and what i want to do is, have a page with the original text on one side and entry on the other, and to basically hold onto that. and that in progress translations would be viewable by registered users but not by like someone just visiting the site
[02:14:43] <GinFuyou> entry == text input?
[02:15:03] <GinFuyou> what is "in progress translations" exactly in this context?
[02:15:12] <hmx-12> yeah!!! sorry if that was unclear. like i want to have text input from the user and hold onto what they type in as an in progress translation
[02:16:18] <GinFuyou> > hold onto what they type in as an in progress translation
[02:16:27] <GinFuyou> really don't understand what it means
[02:17:35] <GinFuyou> You want to submit every change in text input? Like in google docs and similar?
[02:17:55] <hmx-12> sort of? not every change. just when they want to submit it, and then it would hold onto it to be viewed or edited later
[02:17:58] <hmx-12> but i want the original text to be non-editable, just the translation is editable
[02:18:22] <GinFuyou> Ok, so a normal submit? So you are talking about most simple form with one input? ^_^'
[02:18:55] <hmx-12> yeah, i guess? i guess it could be a form. i'd just need a *lot* of forms, because there are many, many files for each character that need to be translated
[02:19:32] <hmx-12> and i'm wondering if there's like a reasonable way to do this without relying on something like google docs where it can get kind of messy and overwhelming
[02:19:33] <GinFuyou> Ok, you haven't told that before I believe?
[02:20:01] <hmx-12> yeah i didn't mention it. because the game has a lot of text, and there are 10 characters each with their own stories
[02:20:42] <GinFuyou> Well, it doesn't mean they have to be on one page. Page size should be limited anyway or it would load too long
[02:21:00] <GinFuyou> But multiple forms are no problem
[02:21:23] <GinFuyou> More of a question how you want to set workflow
[02:21:59] <hmx-12> gotcha, okay. i was thinking maybe a page per file or small group of files? also, is there a way to set like... idk how to put this uh. basically set a group for user(s) that says which characters they can translate?
[02:23:21] <GinFuyou> Yes maybe a group of related texts, like per character or per chapter? You can also use pagination.
[02:24:28] <GinFuyou> You may want some kind of permissions-like relations if you want to limit users to some parts
[02:24:56] <hmx-12> yeah, permissions is exactly what i was thinking. but that's doable?

[02:28:30] <hmx-12> nah, i don't really need that. at most there will be 1-2 people working on each character, and if i break up the files into different pages then they can still work simultaneously on different things

[04:27:35] <schinckel> hmx-12: It's probably still worthwhile looking into something that ensures one user doesn't stomp over the data of another user who was editing the same page at the same time - although you can reduce this even further by using AJAX to submit just the form they are editing.

[10:47:30] <hemebond> Exactly what I ended up with, thank you schinckel 😊
[10:50:20] <hemebond> Any idea if it's possible to do it from the Package perspective?
[10:50:58] <schinckel> You mean get the latest approved release date for each Package?
[10:51:12] <hemebond> Nevermind, that would just be what I have now. This all started because I wanted to reduce database queries.
[10:51:35] <schinckel> You can use Subquery to get that.
[10:51:47] <schinckel> It will do a correlated subquery though, so it won't perform quite as well.
[10:53:44] <schinckel> Package.objects.filter(...).annotate(last_release=Subquery(Release.objects.filter(package=OuterRef('pk'), approved_by__isnull=False).order_by('-created_at')[:1])
[10:53:52] <schinckel> I think I got the parentheses right... ;)
[10:54:21] <schinckel> Oh, missed a `.values('created_at')` on that subquery queryset...
[10:56:21] <schinckel> https://schinckel.net/2019/07/30/subquery-and-subclasses/ has some more stuff like that.
[10:57:23] <hemebond> Nice, thank you.

[11:12:08] <schinckel> It's not quite as nice as being able to do a join on a subquery, but we haven't figured out how to do that in the ORM yet ;)
[11:12:41] <schinckel> (You can do it in a way using the ORM - as long as it's always the same subquery and you can write it as a VIEW, then stick a model in front of it)
[11:16:48] <hemebond> I think I've figured out how to "invert" the queryset so I don't have to update all my filtering code, etc.
[11:17:01] <hemebond> So the original Release-first method works well.

[13:39:40] <Jhin> How can I register the onclick event from the template in the model?
[13:40:19] <moldy> Jhin: javascript runs in the user's browser, your model code runs on the server. you need to send an http request if you want the two to communicate
[13:40:30] <Jhin> in a template I've got a button, onclick does some JavaScript, I would love that button to also change a model field
[13:40:59] <moldy> so, you need to write a view, give it a urlpattern, then make your js code send a request to that url
[13:41:04] <moldy> i.e. AJAX
[13:41:51] <Jhin> Ok, so that's the way we do it
[13:42:25] <moldy> yup
[13:42:36] <Jhin> what about this:
[13:42:39] <Jhin> @register.simple_tag
[13:42:40] <Jhin> def update_variable(value):
[13:42:40] <Jhin>     """Allows to update existing variable in template"""
[13:42:41] <Jhin>     return value
[13:42:41] <Jhin> and then use it like this:
[13:42:42] <Jhin> {% with True as flag %}
[13:42:42] <Jhin>     {% if flag %}
[13:42:43] <Jhin>         //do somethings
[13:42:43] <Jhin>         {% update_variable False as flag %}
[13:42:44] <Jhin>     {% else %}
[13:42:44] <Jhin>         //do somethings
[13:42:45] <Jhin>     {% endif %}
[13:42:45] <Jhin> {% endwith %}
[13:43:31] <Jhin> will this simple_tag be able to access a modelfield and changge it?
[13:44:40] <GinFuyou> Don't paste to channel please!
[13:45:01] <Jhin> sure
[13:45:04] <GinFuyou> It will able to do anything on server. But it already ended when it's in user's browser
[13:45:50] <GinFuyou> If you put adding needed client instructions with it - I guess it works
[13:46:35] <Jhin> I will try this then, but I have to be clear, I don't understand how that works
[13:48:04] <GinFuyou> It doesn't
[13:48:15] <GinFuyou> You still need all the ajax things
[13:48:43] <Jhin> ok Ajax it is then
[13:48:50] <GinFuyou> But you could try to encapsulate inside a tag. Could make sense for reusable apps
[13:49:51] <Jhin> im back in 5 minutes

[14:03:39] <Jhin> Ok I guess will not figure this out. I know how to delete an instance of an object when url contains pk of a single object. But how do I delete multiple objects? I've got a Tag(models.Model): user = ForeignKey(User, ...) and name = CharField (...)
[14:04:23] <dang`r`us> some_queryset.delete()
[14:04:48] <dang`r`us> (some_queryset = the result of a filter call, etcY)
[14:04:49] <Jhin> I want to let the user select
[14:04:51] <GinFuyou> for loop also work but this ^ is more efficient
[14:05:22] <dang`r`us> Jhin, ModelName.filter(pk__in=list_of_ids_selected_by_user).delete()
[14:05:47] <Jhin> how do I pass the list of ids selected by user?
[14:05:54] <Jhin> I'm guessing im using a form
[14:06:20] <Jhin> and posting this form, and in the view im doing the logic
[14:07:47] <GinFuyou> All input goes through a Form
[14:07:53] <Jhin> Should I really spam the main chat with these questions? They are pretty basic and not to percise

[15:37:01] <serafeim> do you know that django 3.2 broke support for older mysql versions ?
[15:37:02] <serafeim> i
[15:37:04] <serafeim> i'
[15:37:30] <Kim^J> Define older
[15:37:32] <serafeim> i've got a project running django 3.1.13 and using an old mysql version that i cannot upgrade. when i try to upgrade this project to 3.2.7 it breaks
[15:38:26] <serafeim> Kim^J: let's not go into this. this is an old unsupported version of mysql. the problem is that django 3.2 which was an LTS dropped the support
[15:38:41] <serafeim> is is very problematic for me because now i can't go to the LTS version
[15:38:52] <Kim^J> So upgrade MysQL
[15:39:02] <hemebond> Which version of MySQL?
[15:39:04] <Kim^J> It's a MySQL issue, not a Djano issue.
[15:39:06] *** Joins: gitly (~gitly@148.252.133.74)
[15:39:20] <hemebond> Have you narrowed down exactly which Django version breaks?
[15:39:36] <serafeim> the version is 5.1.73
[15:40:01] <serafeim> Kim^J: no it is a django issue because it dropped support for this sql version on a minor release
[15:40:15] <Kim^J> 14 November 2008
[15:40:20] <Kim^J> It's time to upgrade.
[15:40:24] <serafeim> Kim^J: yes i know it is very old
[15:41:01] <serafeim> the thing is that *this particular very old database* was supported by django 3.1. and then the support was dropped on the next minor version. if the support was dropped on django 4 then everything would be fine because i'd have the LTS
[15:41:39] <Kim^J> What makes you think Django dropped it? It could be the driver
[15:42:03] <b-rex> none of that matters now. upgrade mysql.
[15:42:08] <serafeim> i only change the django version all other requirements are exactl the same
[15:42:18] <serafeim> django 3.1 it works. django 3.2 it does not work.
[15:42:30] <Kim^J> What doesn't work?
[15:43:02] <serafeim> it throws a crazy error `django.db.utils.OperationalError: (1193, "Unknown system variable 'default_storage_engine'")`
[15:43:28] <serafeim> i suppose the default_storage_engine variable was added in a later mysql version
[15:44:05] <Kim^J> serafeim: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/databases/#creating-your-tables
[15:44:42] <serafeim> Kim^J: yes i know, i do not use this at all
[15:45:18] <serafeim> Kim^J: i think the problem is that they have added this variable in the connection: https://github.com/django/django/blame/1061f5243646b4c9b8a758f8a36c9e2ccdded1cf/django/db/backends/mysql/base.py#L372
[15:45:22] <Kim^J> Well, maybe you should?
[15:45:31] <hemebond> "The end of upstream support periods was reached in January 2012 for MySQL 5.0 and December 2013 for MySQL 5.1. As a consequence, Django 1.8 sets 5.5 as the minimum MySQL version it officially supports."
[15:46:02] <serafeim> hemebond: the thing is that it was working *perfectly* by all django versions before 3.2.
[15:46:19] <Kim^J> So run that then?
[15:46:26] <serafeim> i know it was not supported by django, the mysql also is not supported at all. but it *was* working before that line was added
[15:46:30] <hemebond> It worked but was deprecated.

[15:53:01] <hemebond> Yes. You can't upgrade. Versions 1.8 and beyond required MySQL 5.5.

[15:53:38] <Kim^J> Does that matter?!

[15:54:00] <hemebond> 😲
[15:54:22] <serafeim> yes it matters for me. the first level of attack is the web server and app server. if these are supported then i feel safe

[22:00:58] <dodo> i don't know what "it" means in that sentence
[22:01:23] <piscvau> the topic says it is not supported.
[22:01:34] <piscvau> I have only one class which inherit from auth.
[22:01:59] <GinFuyou> No topic says to share code and traceback via dpaste

[22:10:29] <piscvau> sorry I misunderstood. I thought you were mentioning the topic regerenced in my error message. I prepare a dbpaste.
[22:10:41] <piscvau> here is a dbpaste https://bpa.st/34WQ
[22:13:47] <GinFuyou> why are you calling makemigrations in a script?
[22:15:02] <GinFuyou> migrations are part of code. They should be bundled
[22:15:04] <piscvau> here is the trace https://bpa.st/WLJA
[22:16:15] <piscvau> WHat do you mean by bundled?
[22:16:52] <GinFuyou> added to git for example
[22:19:09] <piscvau> they are in git. but Here I am just creating a new base which is empty and I load it with a sql dump. SO I have no migration because the model is completely coherent with the database content
[22:20:50] <GinFuyou> It has nothing to do with db being empty or not. Makemigrations makes files. It's not part of deployment and highly discouraged
[22:21:11] <GinFuyou> You use it as part of dev cycle
[22:21:26] <GinFuyou> Deployment only needs migrate

[22:23:39] <GinFuyou> Well, you app doesn't use migrations? Like migrations module (dir) was removed?
[22:24:12] <GinFuyou> Also Group is auth.Group? Are you using multi-table inheritance? Are you sure you want it?
[22:24:13] <dodo> it looks like mesrecettes has no migrations, but it should have some
[22:24:53] <dodo> ooh
[22:28:31] <piscvau> OK I see. I had a bad thinking. I deleted migrations to start with a clean app because they were related to old modifications. How do you get rid of old modifications?
[22:28:57] <dodo> what are old modifications?
[22:29:22] <piscvau> modifications of the model that I made before
[22:30:37] <dodo> not sure what you're asking? how to undo code changes? or applied db migrations?

[22:34:12] <GinFuyou> That didn't really made sense. If you recreate DB, there are no changes and applied migrations in it
[22:34:30] <piscvau> No I do not have a prod env yet. otherwise I would not do it
[22:35:10] <GinFuyou> if you have db with applied migrations on other hand, it's not recommended to delete migration files
[22:35:54] <piscvau> recreate database means no changes an applied migrations. But How do I create the auth, admin etc... tables which are not im my db. I thought migrations was the way to do it!..
[22:36:27] <piscvau> No I have no db with applied migrations anywhere
[22:36:50] *** Quits: EvilDMP (~textual@django/moderator/EvilDMP) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[22:38:43] <GinFuyou> "Migrate" manages all things changing database schema (and sometimes - data)
[22:39:12] <dodo> piscvau: if you drop the db and migrate, it will re-create all tables
[22:39:23] <dodo> piscvau: if you selectively delete tables not
[22:40:33] <piscvau> I start with an empty database and with the load sql I populate it with the data from my app but not the data from the admin
[22:41:16] <dodo> piscvau: what's thie load sql thing?
[22:41:18] <dodo> this
[22:41:41] <dodo> ah.. you import a dump
[22:41:46] <dodo> and then you don't have the auth tables?
[22:42:16] <dodo> well. you migrate first, and *then* load the dump.. which might overwrite existing data....
[22:42:29] <piscvau> the load sql thing is a command that executes a load of a sql dump file
[22:42:33] <dodo> and who knows what's in your dump...
[22:42:45] <dodo> you could be creating a migration table with random content
[22:42:52] <dodo> please just don't load a database dump
[22:43:03] <dodo> or
[22:43:10] <dodo> piscvau: *why* do you load a database dump?
[22:43:37] <GinFuyou> there are data migrations - just in case
[22:43:48] <piscvau> right my problem is  that I do not have the auth table.
[22:44:09] <dodo> piscvau: no, your problem seems to be that you import a database dump
[22:44:31] <piscvau> why do I load a sql dump? because the data of my app is coming from an old application. There is a lot of data which I do not want to loose
[22:44:46] <dodo> piscvau: yeah, get your app to work first
[22:44:52] <dodo> you can work on importing the data later
[22:45:06] <dodo> fwiw, i'd write an exporter/importer tool
[22:45:15] <dodo> using sql files to migrate data is... not nice
[22:45:41] <dodo> piscvau: when you don't import the db dump, do your problems go away?

[22:46:19] <piscvau> no the problem arise before I import the sql dump. I come in the migrate
[22:47:41] <piscvau> no the migrate is casing the error in https://bpa.st/WLJA before I import the data
[22:47:42] <dodo> piscvau: can you paste your actual models file?
[22:48:52] <dodo> and like GinFuyou said, don't run makemigrations there
[22:49:01] <dodo> do that before. and commit the migrations to your repo
[22:50:01] <piscvau> https://bpa.st/ZTOQ the complete model file but part of it is in french
[22:50:44] <dodo> and you did run makemigrations now?
[22:51:19] <GinFuyou> So, yeah you are using multi-table inheritance to auth.models.Group
[22:51:26] <piscvau> I My understanding is that the problem come from the family class which inherit from group
[22:52:16] <dodo> yeah
[22:53:11] <piscvau> would it be simpler if I made a one to one relationship from family to group?
[22:54:28] <GinFuyou> It's should be more clear than MTI. May solve the error, but you probably still want migrations for that app
