[01:23:19] <biys> causative: i agree with that to a degree
[01:23:23] <biys> generally speaking, sure
[01:23:44] <biys> but that isn't to say that there aren't peopel who want to.... draw pictures in the sand with a stick and expect to make 6 figures a year doing so
[01:24:15] <biys> or obtain an underwater basket weaving degree
[01:24:23] <biys> then ask themselves "why don't i have a job?!"
[01:24:32] <biys> i think there'a certain amount of person responsbiility associated with being poor
[01:24:37] <biys> some is as a result of a "corrupt system"
[01:24:54] <biys> but i'm fairy certain a large majority of it has to do with personal choices
[01:27:05] <causative> and if their personal choices are the result of their social environment?
[01:27:57] <biys> then the appropriate corrective actions need to be taken, provided the person is willing to take them
[01:28:57] <causative> usually no one is willing to help them with corrective actions
[01:29:10] <biys> i'd likely need an example
[01:29:15] <biys> cause that seems like a generalization
[01:29:24] <causative> well, corrective actions would be, say, career planning, or mental health care
[01:29:33] <causative> both in short supply if you don't already have money
[01:29:56] <biys> depends where you live.  there are lots of free solutions available where i live
[01:30:25] <biys> i'll also say that we can't clump the poor of africa or the rio favelas in with the poor of "the west" for example
[01:30:31] <biys> those are completely different things
[01:31:07] <biys> they would require signifiacntly different solutions
[01:31:43] <tomathy> howdy
[01:31:48] <I_Am_M00t> why do you make it a sport to bash on the less fortunate biys? aren't there more pressing problems?
[01:31:56] <causative> I think the average person is really pretty smart, on the basis that, I'm pretty smart in certain ways, but plenty of average people are smarter than I am in other ways
[01:32:21] <causative> it's a question of how you chose to direct and specialize your intelligence during childhood, rather than the absolute quantity of it
[01:32:26] <biys> sure.  smartness is relative to the situation being discussed
[01:32:57] <biys> with that in mind, causative, there is still certain social mores we all essentially have to abide by given the fact that we're social creatures
[01:33:06] <biys> so i'm not sure what you're attempting to suggest
[01:33:24] <biys> i'm good at math so i don't have to be good at following the law?
[01:33:52] <causative> that the poor aren't poor because they're dumb - they could be capable of being, e.g., an accountant, just their social situation didn't lead them that way
[01:34:01] <biys> i never said they were poor because they were dumb
[01:34:14] <biys> i just said that summarizing all people as poor because of some over-arching systemic problem
[01:34:18] <biys> is kind of a significant over generalization
[01:34:32] <causative> well, it's a systemic problem that their social situation didn't lead them towards a higher-paying career
[01:34:35] <I_Am_M00t> > why do you make it a sport to bash on the less fortunate biys?
[01:34:53] <biys> not really.  there is a certain level of personal responsibility
[01:34:57] <causative> people reflect the people around them
[01:35:10] <I_Am_M00t> i can't imagine the horrible mindset you have
[01:38:44] <biys> so it seems like you're attempting to say that a persons lack of regard for themself is...  a social problem?

[01:41:05] <biys> i don't care about myself, and i neglect enough personal responsibility... society will just come along and clean everything up for me
[01:41:08] <biys> that is their duty!
[01:41:44] <biys> if i don't nourish myself accordingly, do drugs, don't invest in myself - society will do it for me

[07:59:10] <tomathy> doubt can also be a stumbling block in matters of faith and belief, which are the highest matters

[08:01:38] <tomathy> nay, in matters of knowledge we rid ourselves of belief, but in matters of belief, we rid ourselves of doubt
[08:01:41] <causative> belief as an article of faith, unquestioned and unjustified, is enemy-talk; it is from the direction of truth-indifferent or truth-opposed systems

[08:04:24] <amigojapan> Neither faith nor"evidence"probably know what truth is. Nobody really knows

[08:06:03] <tomathy> how can you lack faith and have seen or appreicated that film?
[08:06:13] <tomathy> it sells faith more than anything else
[08:06:37] <tomathy> faith is the way of life
[08:06:53] <causative> because what you call "faith" is completely unnecessary.  I don't know or care why you think faith is a result of seeing or appreciating that film; it sounds like a case of confirmation bias.
[08:09:53] <amigojapan> tomathy: everyone has watched the matrix. It's not really a movie that causes people to become believers in God
[08:10:21] <causative> perhaps you have in mind Kant's response to the evil demon, that the world could not be a deception because Kant has faith in God? if that's what you mean, it's bullshit
[08:11:23] <causative> the correct response to an evil demon or brain-in-a-vat or matrix or simulation scenario is "yeah maybe" (and I'd say the maybe comes to a "probably not" in the totality of evidence)
[08:14:19] <tomathy> why do you consider faith unnecessary?
[08:15:22] <tomathy> isnt it actually a way to live without causing much harm, and to see things done which are hoped for, or rightly desired for, without demanding of them to be?
[08:16:18] <tomathy> sometimes we're wrong
[08:16:44] <tomathy> sometimes we're right
[08:17:23] <tomathy> but i think to caste out belief/faith as if it's a torment, or a waste, is deceptive
[08:17:35] <causative> to blind yourself, to see what you would wish to be true instead of what is supported by evidence?
[08:17:45] <amigojapan> tomathy: how about the people who fly airplanes into buildings do to faith?
[08:17:48] <causative> it marks you as an enemy

[08:20:04] <tomathy> amigojapan: i'm not saying all faith is ethical, i'm saying it's a fucntional way to be, to have faith. do you doubt that those people were effective in their behaviour?
[08:20:13] <causative> even when it doesn't have overt external consequences, to be wrong is an *internal, mental* ultimate harm
[08:20:45] <tomathy> causative: faith does not caste out evidence
[08:20:55] <amigojapan> tomathy: sure. In my belief, faith can be a powerful psychological tool
[08:21:12] <tomathy> but it can endure and persist in spite of it, unlike anything else, and be right
[08:21:22] <causative> it can also endure and persist in spite of it, and be *wrong*
[08:21:36] <causative> and it's more likely to be wrong than right - if you assert something at random without evidence, you're probably wrong
[08:21:46] <causative> and if then you don't allow evidence to correct your belief, you're going to stay wrong
[08:22:10] <causative> to say that blind faith is a powerful social force is true, but all you're saying is that the enemy has powerful weapons
[08:22:21] <causative> the truth-searchers have powerful weapons too
[08:23:25] <tomathy> faith is more powerful than any physical weapon
[08:23:39] <causative> faith is less powerful than truth-searching
[08:24:20] <causative> truth-searching got us to the moon, got us the computer you're typing on.  Faith organizes people into groups, sets them against each other - it doesn't invent, it doesn't discover, it doesn't advance

[12:39:43] <Aidhan> I'm not entirely sure what philosophy is, I'm guessing it's the unanswerable questions of life?
[12:45:30] <Ungwelian> philosophy (n.)
[12:45:31] <Ungwelian> c. 1300, philosophie, "knowledge, learning, scholarship, scholarly works, body of knowledge," from Old French filosofie "philosophy, knowledge" (12c., Modern French philosophie) and directly from Latin philosophia,
[12:45:41] <Ungwelian> from Greek philosophia "love of knowledge, pursuit of wisdom; systematic investigation," from philo- "loving" (see philo-) + sophia "knowledge, wisdom," from sophis "wise, learned;"
[12:46:01] <Aidhan> oh nice
[12:46:19] <Ungwelian> I think "unanswerable" is a bit pessimistic, though :)
[12:47:10] <Aidhan> depends how you see it, perhaps as an opportunity to ponder answers is less so
[12:49:04] <Ungwelian> My wager is, that these questions are nowadays considered unanswerable because the world is becoming increasingly secular.
[12:49:48] <Ungwelian> And traditionally, these questions have been answered by religions & theology.
[12:50:24] <Aidhan> absolutely
