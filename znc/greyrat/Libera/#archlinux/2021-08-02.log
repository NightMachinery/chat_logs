[04:14:22] <FrostySnowman> Hi All,
[04:14:23] <FrostySnowman> I have a thinkpad T480 (no dedicated gpu) and a thinkpad usb c gen 2 dock. I would like to connect 3 monitors to the dock (2 dp and 1 hdmi) I understand the intel display drivers can run up to 3 screens. I can get two monitors and the laptop screen working fine, however when I plug in the third monitor it does not work. I have tried the suggestion
[04:14:23] <FrostySnowman> to ignore on screen close (in /etc/systemd/logind.conf) however that does not help. The challenge appears to be how to disable the internal monitor so that the intel graphics can output to the external monitors. I have tried disabling the xrandr output, as well as using the hdmi of the laptop to no avail. Anyone got any ideas?

[04:25:38] <MacGyver> FrostySnowman: It might also simply be a case of the USB C dock not being able to drive that amount of screens.
[04:25:42] <MacGyver> Ah damn.
[04:26:11] <MacGyver> Well, hope they get the help they need, but afaik sending multiple screens over USB-C has some limits.

[18:09:02] <Midjak> Hi. I get random freeze with kernel 5.10.47-rt45-1-rt-lts on intel N3700 . The problem occurs when I perform heavy operations as build a package. The problem seems to occur only on Xorg I am trying right now to build the package without Xorg and everything seems to work (I will wait the end of the build to be sure). The symptoms are a hard freeze with none device (mouse, keyboard) working. I tried several solution without success here htt
[18:09:02] <Midjak> ps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/intel_graphics#Xorg_configuration
[18:09:34] <NetSysFire> if it freezes, can you still e.g ssh into your device?
[18:09:42] <Midjak> nope
[18:09:55] <jonathon> does it occur with the standard `linux-lts` kernel?

[18:13:30] <y3k> Hey NetSysFire! No fucked up this time... yet, haha. Just really curious. Today I turned on the PC and when I ran `ssh-agent` it got the PID 6100, when it usually had ~650
[18:13:49] <NetSysFire> its just random, dont worry about it
[18:13:57] <NetSysFire> pids dont matter much
[18:14:02] <y3k> I checked my `ps` output and there are a lot "bumps" of thousands.
[18:14:16] <y3k> Random? Thought they were sequential.
[18:14:37] <y3k> Also, ssh-agent has been ~650 for YEARS, since it's one of the first processes I start.
[18:14:54] *** Joins: jaysicks (~jaysicks@91-82-251-137.pool.digikabel.hu)
[18:15:09] <NetSysFire> they are but there being a race condition that some job which invokes lots of processes can "increase" the pids of processes which start later
[18:15:16] <y3k> How it looks like right now, is as if something started thousands of shortlived processes during startup.
[18:15:20] <NetSysFire> yes

[18:15:51] <NetSysFire> this is why i said its semi-random. dont worry about it, especially if you e.g run a DE like KDE
[18:16:00] <y3k> But still... from 650 to 6100, it's interesting.
[18:16:02] <NetSysFire> its still worth to examine your journal for any hints
[18:16:10] <y3k> No DE, just WM
[18:16:21] <y3k> The system is pretty much barebones.
[18:16:33] <NetSysFire> an update could have introduced this behavior, too
[18:16:49] <y3k> i3 with xinitrc and that's basically it, nothing self starts.
[18:16:54] <y3k> Oh yeah, it happened during the update.
[18:16:59] <y3k> I usually update over weekends.
[18:17:07] <y3k> And it's the only time I turn off the PC, ha
[18:17:26] <y3k> i.e. I updated on Saturday, PC was off Sunday and this is happening today.
[18:18:07] <NetSysFire> if you want to find the cause, and this will take much of your time, downgrade each package that was updated and dont forget to reboot after each single downgrade until you find what caused it

[18:42:03] <srp> alternatively, you could install systemd-boot into /boot and make your efi partition mount there
[18:42:08] <srp> which would probably be more convenient
[18:42:19] <stecx> ^ i think my arch.conf is good...
[18:42:28] <srp> your first paste says it isn't
[18:42:44] <srp> > initrd: /initramfs-linux.img (No such file or directory)
[18:42:56] <stecx> yep :(
[18:43:32] <srp> so either your arch.conf needs to be adjusted to point to /boot/initramfs-linux.img *or* you should have your efi partition point to /boot and reinstall systemd-boot on there, if it isn't too late
[18:43:46] <Midjak> NetSysFire, ok. What can I do ? I can try journalctl from ssh once again but I get ntohing from journalctl. However during my tests without Xorg I have seem message about RCU. I tried to google them but I found nothing. As instance "task blocked on level-0 rcu_node" I don't know if it is related to my issue. Do you know what is RCU ?
[18:44:01] <NetSysFire> post the whole log
[18:44:06] <Midjak> ok
[18:44:10] <srp> if this is a working system, then i'd just do the former - but a fresh install, i'd do the latter, even if it meant reinstalling (which should be somewhat painless with archinstall if you aren't doing anything fancy)
[18:44:55] <stecx> adding /boot doesnt help

[18:51:23] <srp> MacGyver: the boot loader entries haven't changed all that substantially in years
[18:51:41] <srp> there's probably more settings available but the basic stuff is still the goto
[18:52:11] <MacGyver> srp: Right, I just needed to double-check that I'm justified in pointing out errors as errors, not weird things that are correct nowadays.
[18:52:31] <MacGyver> Also, looks like systemd-boot does not in fact yet support cross-partition loading.
[18:52:59] *** Joins: dschrempf (~dominik@070-207.dynamic.dsl.fonira.net)
[18:53:03] <MacGyver> Any boot entry in /esp will only be able to use kernels and initramfs in /esp; and any boot entry that must use a kernel in /boot, needs to live itself in /boot/loader/entries.
[18:53:31] <srp> i dunno about that, since XBOOTLDR seems to be able to have separate partitions
[18:53:34] <Scimmia> it does, actually, but the other partition must be fat32 as well
[18:53:37] <MacGyver> So, if that kernel lives in /boot, that entry needs to go to /boot as well. Also the type of /boot needs to be XBOOTLDR and its fs probably needs to be FAT32.
[18:53:53] <MacGyver> Then why does our wiki say "systemd-boot will search for boot menu items in esp/loader/entries/*.conf and additionally in boot/loader/entries/*.conf if using XBOOTLDR. Note that entries in esp can only use files (e.g. kernels, initramfs, images, etc.) in esp. Similarly, entries in boot can only use files in boot."?

[18:56:11] <MacGyver> The boot loader itself can live on the ESP, but the *loader entry* needs to live on the same partition as the files it's loading, according to what it says there.
[18:56:13] <srp> but it could be possible
[18:56:17] <srp> Scimmia: ah, ye
[18:56:25] <MacGyver> And in the pastes provided, that's exactly what's being done.

[18:56:48] <MacGyver> The loader entry is under /efi, and the initramfs is reportedly under /boot.
[18:56:58] <MacGyver> So if that's their intention, the loader entry needs to be moved.
[18:57:10] <srp> are you sure though, since it says that the kernel and initramfs *can* be separate from the esp partition?
[18:57:14] *** Joins: nyah (~nyah@90.221.186.180)
[18:57:17] <MacGyver> Now I'm of course not at all confident that /boot is in fact a correctly formatted XBOOTLDR partition.
[18:57:23] <srp> right
[18:57:27] <srp> that'd be my thought
[18:57:35] <MacGyver> I'm sure that that's what the wiki says.
[18:57:41] <MacGyver> And it kinda makes sense.
[18:57:55] <MacGyver> Because the bootloader entries have always been relative to the partition root.

[20:19:03] <jaawerth> metaljack34: this may not be relevant, one note about this (once you've verified the nslookups work as expected), if it works in curl but not browser, I've noticed with chromium-based browsers that if you resolve something that's https on the VPN (e.g. a "blocked" page or w/e) that's different on the public internet, it caches it super aggressively (for https only) and takes time for the change
[20:19:05] <jaawerth> to reflect
[20:19:14] <jaawerth> not sure if it applies to FF as well
[20:19:23] <cq-work> Unplugging and plugging the monitor appears to fix it.

[23:13:08] <Namarrgon> which packages were updated?
[23:13:24] <Vlek> the kernel version, headers, and a bunch of other stuff.
[23:13:24] <Namarrgon> does the keyboard work when you boot the fallback initramfs?
[23:13:31] <Vlek> No, that also is not working.

[23:14:08] <Vlek> What's the command to do that? I will give it a try right now as I have tried a few different things to try to fix it without any success.

[23:17:11] <Vlek> It should be up-to-date as of 7/15 because of what I did to try to regress the kernel to see if that would fix it.
[23:17:32] <Vlek> I tried rebuilding initramfs and it said it generated the images successfully.
[23:17:42] <Namarrgon> post the output to a paste service
[23:17:45] <Vlek> There are a few warnings for missing firmware for modules though.
[23:18:30] <Vlek> How do I do that via tty?
