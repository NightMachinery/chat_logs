[01:23:53] <ggreer> mRNA flu shots will protect against more variants of influenza and production can be ramped up on shorter timescales. currently it's like 6 months from "oh shit this influenza variant is gonna be bad. we should add it to the vaccine this year" and actual rollout

[01:37:17] <two2thehead> \O/
[01:37:29] <two2thehead> good enough ELI5 for me
[01:37:48] <ggreer> if you inactivate the virus, you usually fuck up its structure or chemistry a little. so your immune system ends up fighting a slightly different version of what you want it to
[01:39:02] <ggreer> I don't think adenovirus vector vaccines have a long future. in addition to becoming immune to the payload, you become immune to the vector. this is why sputnik V uses a different adenovirus for the second shot
[01:44:03] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Previously, you asked me how I feel about this. I was a Scottish nationalist at the age of 15, prepared to punch people on the nose over the issue. I think once you grow out of that kind of thing — by the time I’d got to Oxford, I’d become a young Thatcherite, a kind of punk Tory. The more I reflected on it as a historian, the more I could see that Scotland had a
[01:44:03] <feepbot> great deal out of the Union. It was entirely to the advantage of people like me that Scotland was a part of a greater political unit. Johnson was right about the finest sight a Scotsman sees: the high road to London. All that persuaded me, and I’ve been a proponent of the Union ever since. But having fought the battle over 2014 when the referendum on independence occurred last,
[01:44:03] <feepbot> I’m a little bit despondent at the thought of having to make all those arguments again. Maybe in the end, you just have to treat it like the Quebec issue and try to call the nationalists’ bluff because I don’t really think there’s that profound a sentiment in favor of nationalism. The SNP keeps this going with a mixture of anti-English sentiment and trying to distract
[01:44:08] <feepbot> attention from its own failures because they basically do run Scotland. Devolution has given them all the power that matters. These issues are so parochial that it’s hard for me to get excited about them anymore. I would now say, “Well, okay, try independence and see how you like it. You think you’re going to be a Scandinavian country, but you’ll turn out to be a Balkan

[03:09:56] <feepbot> laarc (Links for the curious)
[03:10:05] <shawwwn> they were like "so it's python and reads flat files?" and I said nah, it's arc, a lisp dialect
[03:10:20] <shawwwn> showed that I could change things in the repl on the fly without redeploying
[03:10:36] <shawwwn> gonna fuck around making a beatsaber mapping program
[03:10:43] <adiabatty> is arc the paul graham lisp
[03:12:39] <Betawolf> (wow, it really was about Kyon taking 600 years to do his homework)
[03:13:15] <saturn2> adiabatty: yes
[03:13:26] <adiabatty> oh neat. how is it compared to other lisps?
[03:13:39] <nshepperd> can't believe nagato put up with him
[03:15:16] <gwern> Betawolf: you think *you* had a lot of summer homework, it's nothing compared to japanese kids
[03:15:47] <PapuaHardyNet> laarc.io is really interesting
[03:17:55] <gwern> I think pg has moved onto a slightly different lisp he calls 'bel' now
[03:17:57] <Betawolf> great demonstration of infinite power, though. While the likelihood of completing your summer homework is minute, given enough iterations it will happen.
[03:19:08] <shawwwn> adiabatty: I like it because it's designed to make creating webapps as easy as possible
[03:19:19] <shawwwn> if you want to spin up a form, it's literally just (aform ...)
[03:19:37] <adiabatty> Interesting. So it has built-in functions for generating HTML bits?
[03:20:19] <shawwwn> yup. e.g. here's creating a new blog post https://github.com/laarc/laarc/blob/master/blog.arc#L56-L57
[03:20:19] <adiabatty> Is there anything in the language that assists with this, or could this sort of thing be ported (possibly with less-ergonomic function names) to other lisps?
[03:20:30] <feepbot> laarc/blog.arc at master · laarc/laarc · GitHub (https://www.laarc.io/. Contribute to laarc/laarc development by creating an account on GitHub.)
[03:21:18] <shawwwn> [+ _ 1] is equivalent to (fn (x) (+ x 1))... so the brackets are shorthand
[03:21:40] <shawwwn> and (prn:+ 1 2) is equivalent to (prn (+ 1 2))
[03:21:43] <shawwwn> the : is composition
[03:21:55] <shawwwn> so (foo:bar:baz x) is (foo (bar (baz x)))
[03:22:03] <adiabatty> that seems handy
[03:22:12] <shawwwn> yup. and that's pretty much all the fanciness there is
[03:22:26] <shawwwn> beyond that, it's just powerful functions and macros
[03:22:35] <adiabatty> I don't know all the memes. How am I supposed to interpret "posts*", with only the trailing asterisk?
[03:22:57] <shawwwn> ah, that just means global variable
[03:23:16] <adiabatty> Do other lisps use *foo* for globals?
[03:24:57] <shawwwn> yeah
[03:25:04] <shawwwn> I like foo* better since it's easier to type
[03:25:11] <shawwwn> I spun up an instance of blog.arc so that you can see what it's like http://vegeta.shawwn.com:1234/blog
[03:25:17] <adiabatty> makes sense. one shift-key press instead of two
[03:25:32] <adiabatty> neat
[03:26:15] <shawwwn> so on http://vegeta.shawwn.com:1234/newpost you can see what https://github.com/laarc/laarc/blob/master/blog.arc#L55-L60 does
[03:26:23] <shawwwn> it's a white page, with a form that has a title and text field
[03:26:35] <shawwwn> and when it's submitted, it runs [let u (get-user _) (post-page u (addpost u (arg _ "t") (md-from-form:arg _ "b")))]
[03:26:51] <shawwwn> it's helpful to read it right to left
[03:27:04] <shawwwn> so the first thing it does is (arg _ "b") which just gets the parameter "b" that was submitted with the form
[03:27:10] <shawwwn> which is the text body
[03:27:20] <shawwwn> then (md-from-form ...) parses it as markdown
[03:27:52] <shawwwn> then (addpost u (arg _ "t") that) adds it as a post to your username with the title specified by the "t" parameter of the form
[03:28:15] <shawwwn> so it's super simple to just have "a form that does things"
[03:29:19] <saturn2> adiabatty: i don't think there's anything in arc that's outside what you can do with macros and reader macros, the idea was just to have a consensus for a useful and tasteful set of those
[03:29:58] <shawwwn> basically. but the specific choices matter a lot
[03:30:11] <shawwwn> racket is theoretically capable of everything that arc does -- in fact, it's powered by racket under the hood
[03:30:19] <shawwwn> but working in racket is roughly 10x more painful (for me at least)
[03:30:43] <adiabatty> I wonder how extra crappy this would all look if laarc used bootstrap classes on just about every element like most webshit I'm knee-deep in does
[03:31:17] <adiabatty> one of the nice things about having an entirely separate template language is that it keeps the UI crap away from the actual logic that requires a different mindset to keep your head in
[03:31:46] <adiabatty> or at the very least the first part of a JSX function that returns an element for React
[03:32:02] <shawwwn> lol
[03:32:06] <adiabatty> Because Racket doesn't have the tastefully-chosen names?
[03:32:15] <shawwwn> nah, it doesn't have non-hygenic macros
[03:32:19] <shawwwn> which is no small loss
[03:32:42] <shawwwn> so for example, I just created this: https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/QGc2GKvD/
[03:32:52] <shawwwn> if you go here, you can see it http://vegeta.shawwn.com:1234/ohai
[03:32:53] <feepbot> Snippet | IRCCloud
[03:32:53] <adiabatty> hygenic macros are ones that won't fuck up things like SOME_MACRO(x++) in, say, C?
[03:33:02] <shawwwn> try posting text like:
[03:33:02] <shawwwn> > *test*
[03:33:03] <shawwwn> woohoo _asdf_
[03:33:27] <shawwwn> so basically my goal just then was to create a "markdown previewer", and it took me about 10 seconds
[03:33:33] <shawwwn> due to the power of having the macros at my disposal
[03:34:00] <shawwwn> I can't think of a simple explanation of non-hygenic macrosf
[03:34:11] <shawwwn> they're a stupid concept, designed to protect the programmer from themselves
[03:34:14] <shawwwn> I hate that it's the default in racket
[03:34:22] <saturn2> adiabatty: no, hygenic macros are about leaking symbols from inside the macro to macro-using code
[03:34:24] <shawwwn> er, hygenic macros are the stupid concept
[03:34:30] <shawwwn> non-hygenic macros are the things that make sense
[03:34:42] <adiabatty> oh right right, I remember skimming this in Butterick's thingy
[03:34:45] <saturn2> or rather, hygenic macros prefent you from doing that
[03:34:47] <shawwwn> so like, here's whenlet
[03:34:50] <shawwwn> (mac whenlet (var expr . body)
[03:34:50] <shawwwn>   `(iflet ,var ,expr (do ,@body)))
[03:34:57] <gwern> that's quite a take. why do I want my macros clobbering accidentally-same-named variables by default?
[03:35:15] <shawwwn> because
[03:35:21] <saturn2> gwern: because the cure is worse than the problem
[03:35:26] <shawwwn> (whenlet foo (+ 1 2) (+ foo 3)) returns 6
[03:35:31] <shawwwn> but here's awhen
[03:35:34] <shawwwn> (mac awhen (expr . body)
[03:35:34] <shawwwn>   `(let it ,expr (if it (do ,@body))))
[03:35:40] <shawwwn> as you can see, it automatically uses the variable name "it"
[03:35:42] <shawwwn> so 
[03:35:48] <shawwwn> (awhen (+ 1 2) (+ it 3))
[03:35:55] <shawwwn> it's easier to read, easier to write, and consistent
[03:36:03] <shawwwn> it introduces the variable name "it" in the macro itself
[03:36:06] <shawwwn> you can't easily do that in racket
[03:36:11] <shawwwn> you *can*, but it's hard by default
[03:36:23] <shawwwn> especially if you're trying to refer to a global variable (which you want to do sometimes)
[03:36:58] <Ralith> this is the sort of thing that gets lisp a reputation as being unusable for projects involving more than one developer
[03:37:18] <adiabatty> Ralith: basically RoR, but more. Lot of magic.
[03:37:29] <shawwwn> not quite as much magic as it seems
[03:37:35] <shawwwn> just good design
[03:37:42] <Ralith> I rather thing ruby is quite a lot more magical, in fact
[03:37:43] <adiabatty> Good design…and magic.
[03:37:56] <Ralith> but that is mostly because it is more complex to begin with
[03:38:01] <adiabatty> actually yeah, ruby probably has more magic

[04:14:44] <[itchyjunk]> I liked the look of the 3rd one and it looks glossy. i think this is either due to eggs in recipe or butter coating or somesuch?
[04:14:48] <nshepperd> maybe i need to give up and use alamy which has real captions instead of danbooru ;_;

[04:15:09] <[itchyjunk]> Can AI takes images and spit out ingredients? would it be the type of problem an AI could solve?
[04:16:04] <shawwwn> define "ingredients"
[04:16:13] <shawwwn> like cooking ingredients?
[04:16:25] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[04:16:38] <shawwwn> I think it could spit out recipes for things that look visually similar
[04:16:40] <[itchyjunk]> like if it saw image of bread, would it be able to tell me which one used eggs?
[04:16:45] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[04:16:55] <shawwwn> it'd be able to give you bread recipes given a picture of bread
[04:17:17] <shawwwn> I have no idea if it could give that level of detail you're wanting though
[04:18:18] <[itchyjunk]> like sour dough and some basic bread would look visually different right? I imagine a baker would be able to look at say `ah! this is sourdough`
[04:22:20] <nshepperd> my upscaler is getting heckin good though, so it was all worth it
[04:23:25] <nshepperd> https://zlkj.in/dalle/upscaled/a3d6d81e3776edd66d3f819d49b5a4dc.png it barely fucked up this image at all even despite vqgan compression
[04:23:28] <Robomot> image/png (1376x1344; 912 KB)
[04:24:33] <Ralith> [itchyjunk]: bread is more complicated than that
[04:24:41] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[04:25:09] <[itchyjunk]> What's an upscaler? :s
[04:25:20] <Ralith> the appearance of a given dough changes dramatically depending on how you knead/proof/shape/bake it
[04:25:49] <nshepperd> upscaler take small picture, upscaler make big
[04:25:50] <[itchyjunk]> Ralith, right. but would that mean an AI can't figure it out?
[04:26:06] <[itchyjunk]> nshepperd, ahh, does as i had guessed it would..
[04:26:25] <Ralith> there are many different mutually exclusive paths that might end up with nearly visually identical breads
[04:26:36] <[itchyjunk]> so like in the old tv where they say "zoom in and inhance" that wasn't realistic, it's not realistic with your upscaler?
[04:26:51] <[itchyjunk]> since zooming in, you'ed lose data but the upscaler is filling it in?
[04:27:10] <[itchyjunk]> Ralith, is that a hypothesis or you know this for a fact?
[04:27:14] <nshepperd> my upscaler invents plausible details to fill in the gaps
[04:27:27] <nshepperd> instead of just making a blurry image
[04:27:32] <ggreer> https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02036-1 sigh
[04:27:32] <Robomot> The lack of people of colour in science images must be fixed (Archives, libraries, photo agencies and publishers need to do better to reflect science’s true past and present.)
[04:27:35] <[itchyjunk]> right so it can zoom in and inhance
[04:27:41] <Ralith> it is obviously true if you spend much time around bread, yes
[04:28:03] <nshepperd> basically
[04:28:08] <[itchyjunk]> eh proof by obviousness sounds like a hypothesis
[04:28:26] <Ralith> reality is an illusion
[04:28:37] <Ralith> who really knows anything
[04:28:50] <[itchyjunk]> ggreer, what's the solution? Have an ai that non people of color and generate people of color?
[04:29:18] <[itchyjunk]> that takes*
[04:29:47] <[itchyjunk]> What's the opposite of people of colour?
[04:29:49] <[itchyjunk]> white people?
[04:30:35] <nshepperd> a bayesian superintelligence could probably identify a bread recipe just by looking at the result
[04:30:50] <[itchyjunk]> ah!
[04:31:02] <[itchyjunk]> so in theory, it would be possible for AI to figure out ingridents based on images
[04:31:11] <[itchyjunk]> ?
[04:31:11] <nshepperd> from like subtle patterns of bubbles on the surface or something
[04:31:22] <Ralith> in theory, it is possible for an AI to take over the world over a one bit per second modem
[04:31:23] <[itchyjunk]> right
[04:31:51] <nshepperd> but idk, if you just take a picture carelessly with a camera it might be limited by resolution
[04:32:00] <Ralith> an actual baker certainly cannot make such inferences, though in practice you can generally get 90% of cases just by pattern-matching conventional cosmetics
[04:32:08] <[itchyjunk]> well, i am dealing with whether something is even possible to begin with or laws of physics or some such prevent it.
[04:32:15] <Ralith> most things that are shaped like baguettes are in fact baguettes, etc
[04:32:20] <[itchyjunk]> An actual baker can to certain degree of accuracy.
[04:32:28] <[itchyjunk]> Not sure why you say they can't.
[04:32:38] <[itchyjunk]> They, infact, do it all the time.
[04:33:00] <[itchyjunk]> The look at the final product to infer what needs to be tweaked in the ingredients.
[04:33:14] <adiabatty> what if the noob baker baked the baguette so wrongly that it wouldn't even be considered a baguette inside
[04:33:20] <adiabatty> but it's still long like a baguette
[04:33:22] <nshepperd> most bakers don't spend all day learning how to predict recipes from breads
[04:33:28] <Ralith> why even bother asking the question if you're so convinced you already know the answers
[04:33:34] <[itchyjunk]> adiabatty, would it look like a baguette from the outside?
[04:33:39] <[itchyjunk]> but not be one from the inside?
[04:33:52] <adiabatty> right. like, maybe it's like focaccia inside or something
[04:33:59] <[itchyjunk]> I'm not convinced. You're the one answering it with certainity.
[04:34:03] <adiabatty> I know diddly squat about bread baking, so
[04:34:13] <Ralith> adiabatty: that specific case would actually be a hell of an accomplishment
[04:34:14] <[itchyjunk]> And seems like not everyone agrees with your hypothesis.
[04:34:18] <Ralith> foccacia doesn't shape
[04:34:24] <Ralith> it's practically batter
[04:34:45] <Ralith> though ofc there's little you can't do with a mold and an airbrush
[04:35:16] <nshepperd> iirc a major contributor to the texture of the crust is steam escaping from the inside. so fucking up the baking so that the inside cooks differently will plausibly result in a visually distinguishable exterior
[04:36:04] <Ralith> a good-faith loaf's appearance is mostly about the baking, yeah
[04:36:20] <Ralith> the composition of the dough is the trickier part
[04:36:50] <[itchyjunk]> Here, they look visually different to me
[04:36:51] <[itchyjunk]> https://ttm.sh/tnv.jpg
[04:36:52] <Robomot> image/jpeg (949x2080; 613 KB)
[04:37:01] <[itchyjunk]> But what is the difference that I am noticing? I don't know
[04:37:08] <[itchyjunk]> I seem to think they look different
[04:37:08] <Ralith> indeed
[04:37:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's a top crust and a bottom crust
[04:37:30] <[itchyjunk]> but if i ask myself why, my go to answer seems to be ingredients difference
[04:37:36] <Ralith> lol
[04:37:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Bottom picture is bottom crust
[04:37:42] <[itchyjunk]> oh its the same loaf?
[04:37:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes lol
[04:37:46] <[itchyjunk]> poop
[04:37:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> gg
[04:37:55] <[itchyjunk]> how did you figure it out?
[04:37:57] <[itchyjunk]> experience?
[04:38:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> yes
[04:38:04] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm
[04:38:11] <Ralith> Obormot\Arcturus is actually a baker
[04:38:13] <[itchyjunk]> is it shiny because the pan was oiled?

[04:38:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Top crust, bottom crust
[04:38:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Pan was oiled yeah
[04:39:06] <Ralith> dough in direct contact with a pan will always cook very differently than dough only in contact with the air
[04:39:13] <[itchyjunk]> would you be able to tell the difference between a sourdough and a non sourdough visually?
[04:39:18] <Ralith> different pan materials (stone, metal, glass) will also have different effects
[04:39:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sourdough and non? Probably not from a photo
[04:39:42] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[04:39:54] <[itchyjunk]> maybe baking jobs are AI-safe then
[04:40:24] <Ralith> for better or for worse, baking jobs do not consist of forensic loaf identification
[04:40:52] <[itchyjunk]> Well, say i find a really delicious loaf of bread.
[04:40:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Law & Order: Sourdough Bread Unit
[04:41:11] <[itchyjunk]> What information would i have to provide an AI so it can replicate it? all i had was actual piece of bread
[04:41:17] <[itchyjunk]> pictures? texture?
[04:41:24] <[itchyjunk]> that would be the limit of what i could provide
[04:41:33] <[itchyjunk]> maybe describe the taste? but that's subjective
[04:41:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> In New York city, yeast-based offenses are considered especially delicious. The detectives that investigate these scrumptious crimes are members of an elite squad known as the Sourdough Bread Unit. These are their stories.
[04:42:11] <Ralith> if you got enough people to rate the taste along a well-conceived set of dimensions you might do okay
[04:42:45] <Ralith> extracting information like "how much fat is there" visually is going to have uselessly high error bars
[04:42:59] <Ralith> and dramatic effect on the taste/usability
[04:43:01] <nshepperd> a mass spectrogram of the interior would probably do the trick

[04:43:43] <[itchyjunk]> i suppose if it was brute forcing it or somesuch?

[04:44:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah DIY bagels is one of the most daunting baking projects I can think of
[04:44:15] <nshepperd> sure, if you have a dataset of millions of spectrograms and recipes to train it on
[04:44:28] <Ralith> also got some leads on a few other less-pretentious offerings that I have't made my way to yet
[04:44:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well these bagels at least look potentially real
[04:45:04] <[itchyjunk]> oh i see, so this would be supervised learning
[04:45:13] <Ralith> definitely a different species of thing

[08:39:03] <feep> welp, logos01 left
[08:39:06] <feep> good job ops
[08:39:45] <feep> the channel is instantly more correct about fucking air conditioner drains
[08:45:57] <adiabatty> since we're indulging in sarcasm I'd also like to point out that we don't have anyone who gleefully spoils 15-year-old media properties around people who haven't seen them yet
[08:54:10] <feep> eh, I think you'll find that's not an exclusive role.
[09:08:11] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: regarding the blandness of Skyrim, I think the biggest contributor is level scaling
[09:08:53] <PapuaHardyNet> the reward of being able to one shot low level mobs and being able to take on endgame bosses isn't there due to level scaling, making progression feel meaningless
[09:09:50] <feep> I think that's a totally separate reason it's bland from what I was saying.
[09:09:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: It's unfortunate that Logos01 left, but do you propose that anyone be allowed to do anything if they'd leave otherwise? I mean, we can disagree on whether the given action was correct or not, but surely Logos01 leaving is not an *additional* argument either way
[09:10:10] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: no I just think the +q was a bad decision.
[09:10:37] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: bad decisions are bad because they have bad consequences
[09:10:56] <PapuaHardyNet> sure, I'm just adding on something I believe is a gameplay issue
[09:11:21] <feep> I don't think anyone specific leaving is an argument, or should be an argument, but "bad mod decisions cause people in general to leave" is valid and individuals leaving does provide evidence towards that
[09:11:55] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: like, "do X or I leave" should not work, but "do X or *people* leave" should.
[09:12:33] <feep> so it's not an argument about the specific mod decision, I just want it thrown on the evidence pile.
[09:13:13] <feep> for comparison, one of my points was "this is the sort of thing that causes channel forks".
[09:14:09] <saturn2> what i said in #lw-meta:
[09:14:12] <saturn2> 2021-07-28 05:10:54     saturn2 so, i feel strongly that what logos01 has been doing can't be allowed - making up ideas in his mind about how things are, not bothering to check them, stating them as absolute fact, if challenged trying to shift the goalposts to make himself retroactively right or just bringing up a bunch of tangential points as a distraction
[09:14:14] <feep> in a more general sense, I think ops are a broken institution and should be replaced with a subscription system.
[09:14:14] <saturn2> 2021-07-28 05:11:45     saturn2 he's done this several times over the past few weeks, sometimes while i've been here, other times i've only seen it in the backlog
[09:14:16] <saturn2> 2021-07-28 05:14:16     saturn2 i'm open to the possibility that there was a better way to get him to not do that anymore, i'm not really open to just letting him keep getting away with it
[09:14:46] <feep> saturn2 I think by the time you are at "I can't let him get away with it" you should not be doing op decisions, that is not a good oppy mindset.
[09:15:14] <feep> but that said I think what was actually happening was just "logos01 is shit at communication because he is autistic"
[09:15:54] <feep> like fuck man, if repeatedly confidently asserting things that are false is now banworthy, then ban me now.
[09:16:12] <feep> the only difference is that I ritually hedge.
[09:16:44] <feep> you shouldn't believe people's confident assertions without sources *anyway*! this is not something that should need to be fixed at the source
[09:16:48] <feep> certainly not with mod action.
[09:17:39] <saturn2> when was the last time you confidently asserted something that was false?
[09:17:44] <feep> few days, I think
[09:17:45] <rsaarelm> I think the problem is when you keep being wrong and start making lots of noise arguing for your case. If you're spitballing, you're not supposed to get totally invested in a spitball.
[09:17:59] <saturn2> yes
[09:18:13] <feep> uh, of course I argue for my case, I just asserted a thing, so as human cognition goes, I assume it is true, so I assume I believed it for a reason and I start explaining that reason
[09:18:15] <feep> this is how brain do
[09:18:54] <feep> in any case, I don't think logos01 was *invested*
[09:19:08] <feep> I just think he's rubbish at signalling investment level.
[09:19:34] <feep> which again, shouldn't be a strong factor anyways, *and in any case, still doesn't justify mod action*.
[09:20:09] <feep> so far as I can tell, logos01 was banned for exhibiting a totally normal behavior, even for people here, While Autistic.
[09:20:44] <feep> like, this is what happened five seconds later in pm
[09:20:54] <feep> "logos01 you are cool and I love you, but here is a link disagreeing with the drain thing"
[09:21:01] <feep> "oyeah you're right, I was wrong about that"
[09:21:06] <feep> ^ depicted: a very invested person
[09:21:48] <feep> in summary, your argument is bad, your perception is biased, and your decision was unjust.
[09:22:52] <feep> (this is why moderators should be abolished. I want an irc command to subscribe to someone opping...)
[09:23:19] <feep> (there's simply no reason or need for forcing this position globally except it was easier historically.)
[09:23:32] <rsaarelm> I sorta feel like it's part of the local culture that if you're wrong about a thing and get very enthusiastically fighty about your side, things go bad for you. And this is different from wider social norms.
[09:23:48] <feep> I completely disagree that this is or should be part of the local culture!
[09:23:50] <adiabatty> the trouble with your kind of thing is that the conversation gets fractured as different people have different filters in place
[09:24:00] <feep> getting invested in debates is fun, good and on brand.
[09:24:55] <feep> adiabatty: sure, but first of all you could also remove lines addressed to a person, second, well, given a *serious* fracturing you'd presumably still split channels
[09:25:02] <rsaarelm> The problem is, people should be able to self-correct.
[09:25:09] <feep> and third, this is already the case with /ignore, which is an existing feature that is per-client rather than per-server
[09:25:28] <feep> rsaarelm: yes I hear it's great for self-correcting if you assert you're right and then punish your debate partner
[09:25:35] <feep> much better than posting links or trying to convince them
[09:25:38] <feep> very lesswrong
[09:26:06] <feep> much virtues
[09:26:41] <rsaarelm> And someone being wrong and getting fighty looks like they haven't been able to self-correct, and they're invested on their stance so other-correcting won't work, and the conversation is deteriorating fast because "here's why you're wrong on a pretty simple level" isn't that exciting and it's mostly a psychodrama where the person's ego doesn't let them admit they were wrong.
[09:27:05] <feep> I think someone being wrong and getting fighty is *much* more harmless than someone being *right* and getting fighty *with their +o*.
[09:27:39] <rsaarelm> I'm recalling some rando years ago who got extremely invested in it being formally impossible for IQ values to be below zero and just doubled down when being explained the normal distribution formalization until I guess they were kicked out or something.
[09:27:43] <feep> at any rate, it turns out correcting logos01 was extremely trivial.
[09:28:00] <feep> I just had to try for literally one minute.
[09:28:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: I dunno man, I think your excuses for Logos01 do not bear any resemblance to reality
[09:28:31] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus I once argued with you for five hours about whether harmony exists, kindly shut up
[09:28:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hardly comparable
[09:28:49] <feep> yeah, it was much more annoying
[09:28:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> No way
[09:29:09] <adiabatty> :popcorn:
[09:29:16] <feep> (srsly, I didn't mind that, I'm not saying it was bad)
[09:29:45] <feep> (I'm just feeling fighty rn because Someone Hurt My Ingroup For No Good Reason)
[09:29:51] <rsaarelm> Holy shit.
[09:29:53] <feep> anyway so my take is ya'll are just projecting aggressive stubbornness onto him because you got into a weird mode of assuming aggressiveness and then finding evidence for it by looking
[09:29:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> No one hurt anyone
[09:30:17] <rsaarelm> I just went back to the logs looking if I can see who the no negative IQs rando actually was.
[09:30:22] <rsaarelm> And guess what.
[09:30:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Logos01 was doing a very dumb thing that was *also* injurious to the health of this channel and to the usefulness of said channel to everyone in it
[09:30:25] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: by the time someone "has to step away from irc for a few days" I think it is safe to assume that they were hurt
[09:30:36] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: I think the mod action was more injurious frankly
[09:30:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is not safe to assume that at all, gtfo
[09:31:00] <feep> eehh
[09:31:11] <rsaarelm> It was Logos01 back in 2011.
[09:31:13] <feep> anyway, the problem is autistic people are kind of like
[09:31:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> rsaarelm: rofl
[09:31:19] <adiabatty> sounds like a reasonable assumption to me
[09:31:21] <saturn2> rsaarelm: my god
[09:31:25] <feep> rsaarelm: yeah I was gonna say, I mean, I didn't say that earlier so I don't get points for it
[09:31:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: The mod action seemed like the only alternative in this case, do you have a better one?
[09:31:34] <adiabatty> maybe not always true, but…a reasonable assumption
[09:31:36] <feep> rsaarelm: but I was *totally* gonna say, "that seems like a perfectly fine debate for this channel"
[09:31:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Keep in mind that the *goal* of the mod action was clearly correct
[09:31:48] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: yes! argument! links! which *I know worked*!
[09:31:56] <feep> worst-case, just *dropping the topic*!
[09:32:13] <feep> or how about this
[09:32:21] <feep> "logos01: :puts on +o hat: please drop the topic"
[09:32:23] <feep> you know
[09:32:24] <feep> like sane people
[09:32:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Dropping the topic doesn't work
[09:32:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Argument and links also didn't work
[09:32:34] <feep> uh
[09:32:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> This was demonstrated
[09:32:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, no.
[09:32:40] <feep> same in reverse.
[09:32:49] <feep> I tried argument and links, kindly, charitably, for literally one minute
[09:32:57] <feep> and it worked perfectly fine.
[09:33:19] <feep> like, logos01 is autistic, what's your excuse.
[09:33:37] <saturn2> almost everyone here is autistic
[09:33:40] <feep> diagnosed*
[09:33:48] <PapuaHardyNet> :(
[09:33:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> What difference does that make
[09:34:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if we get a psychologist in here and diagnose everyone
[09:34:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> What will change
[09:34:11] <feep> then I will be more charitable with you
[09:34:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> -_-
[09:34:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Are you kidding
[09:34:19] <feep> but I will also advocate that you do not be mods. :P
[09:34:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep you are being super dumb, sorry
[09:34:42] <feep> I feel I am being entirely consistent.
[09:34:54] <adiabatty> the funny thing about "but he's autistic on the internet" is that I was in this one channel a while ago and the actually autistic guy was normal with us and the only 'autistic' guy was the guy who was a tankie berniebro who occasionally went full /pol/ every few months
[09:34:58] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't think one should give extra privileges to someone just because they are autistic
[09:35:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Being autistic is not some sort of "get out of not being an obnoxious idiot free" pass
[09:35:06] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: it's not privileges.
[09:35:12] <adiabatty> Of course, if you've met one autistic person, you've met…one autistic person, but still.
[09:35:19] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: it's a question of assumptions about the intent behind ways of communicating.
[09:35:37] <PapuaHardyNet> I mean the threshold for patience and understanding should be low enough that even autistic rationalists shouldn't have problems
[09:35:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> There are better and worse, and correct and incorrect, ways of communicating
[09:35:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> In some cases, the ways autistic people tend to communicate by default are actually the better ones
[09:36:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> In other cases, the opposite
[09:36:27] <feep> yes, and in those cases we assume they're stubborn and invested (because that's what that would signal in a neurotypical) and kick them out?
[09:36:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or we don't assume anything and instead treat people according to how they behave
[09:36:52] <saturn2> it seems that feep and kuudes are the only ones strongly opposed to this, anyone else?
[09:36:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> (cf. the "person-interface" idea)
[09:37:23] <feep> saturn2: I object to the framing as "anyone who speaks up is opposed", from where I'm standing you, obormot and rsaarelm are the only ones in favor.
[09:37:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Like, we're autistic, right? And that means we don't have to care about people's feelings)
[09:37:50] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: it's not a question of caring, it's a question of capability of communication.
[09:38:08] <adiabatty> I'll publicly register my mixed emotions/thoughts. (I've aired them privately.)
[09:38:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: If someone is *incapable* of not being an obnoxious idiot, it does not follow that they should be allowed to be an obnoxious idiot
[09:38:21] <feep> in any case, this wasn't +q for hurting people's feelings, so your entire argument misses the point.
[09:38:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's like that Diogenes anecdote
[09:38:49] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: logos01 is entirely capable of not being an obnoxious idiot, there is even already an established mechanism that works
[09:38:51] <feep> argument and links.
[09:39:13] <feep> "asserting confidently the opposite while being a mod" worked too, I guess, in that the problem has left permanently
[09:39:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Cool, if he's capable of it, then he should do so
[09:39:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> “It’s my fate to steal,” pleaded the man who had been caught red-handed by Diogenes.
[09:39:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> “Then it is also your fate to be beaten,” said Diogenes, hitting him across the head with his staff. 
[09:39:51] <feep> you have to actually buy a ticket^W^W^W use the mechanism.
[09:39:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> ^ the anecdote in question
[09:40:20] <feep> "I thought that was my food," pleaded the man.
[09:40:32] <feep> "Then you deserve this," said Diogenes, fixing the problem with violence.
[09:40:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Unironically yes
[09:40:48] <feep> Unironically no.
[09:41:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Otherwise the incentive is just to claim "I thought that was my food" and then you get a pass for stealing
[09:41:27] <feep> :xkcd about how most people are not psychopaths:
[09:41:36] <feep> and this comes back to how the entire problem is one of lack of charity
[09:41:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> People in here are way, way, way more charitable about this kind of thing than anywhere else
[09:42:04] <feep> In general yes.
[09:42:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> I, personally, appreciate this about this channel
[09:42:13] <feep> That's why this case so upsets me.
[09:42:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Logos01 went like five ballparks past "charity"
[09:42:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> (As he's done before)
[09:42:25] <feep> I disagree.
[09:42:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Multiple times)
[09:42:39] <feep> I mean, let us remember that what we are in fact talking about is
[09:42:41] <feep> drains.
[09:42:45] <feep> air conditioner drains.
[09:42:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, and?
[09:43:01] <rsaarelm> I'm pretty much agreeing with the Diogenes anecdote myself.
[09:43:22] <adiabatty> To the extent that the Diogenes quote is relevant, I'm on Diogenes' side.
[09:43:36] <feep> I'm on Diogenes' side in the original quote, I am strongly against Diogenes in the modified quote.
[09:44:23] <rsaarelm> Fwiw, I do think it's a bit of a tricky situation for healthy conversation if you have people who are both mods performing mod action as needed and enthusiastically participating in debates, but you take the mods who are willing to volunteer.
[09:44:25] <feep> in fact, if we consider diogenes telling the anecdote, I would be willing to guess it was the second and then framed at the first.
[09:44:35] <feep> rsaarelm: shit, I'll do it
[09:44:48] <feep> I mean, I can kick spammers too :p
[09:45:25] <feep> wouldn't have mattered in this case though because in general, the mod activity you get is the minimum of the mod action thresholds.
[09:46:04] <feep> that's why like ... if you need more mods mod I'll happily volunteer, but in general I don't think *anyone* should mod people who have recently pissed them off, *evr*.
[09:46:06] <feep> e*
[09:46:20] <PapuaHardyNet> huh, are you saying that the mod(s) who debated logos01 ended up quieting him?
[09:46:25] <feep> just saturn2
[09:46:28] <feep> and yes
[09:46:55] <adiabatty> I think we just have two active mods now that namespace is basically gone — gwern and saturn2
[09:46:56] <PapuaHardyNet> well, I'm now in support of your line of reasoning, for what its worth
[09:47:14] <saturn2> there's also nshepperd
[09:47:19] <adiabatty> ah right ty
[09:47:43] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: anyway I don't think logos01 went maybe one unit past charity *and also was annoying*.
[09:47:47] <feep> I think*
[09:47:54] * feep rephrase
[09:47:58] <feep> one unit into charity budget*
[09:48:15] <feep> like, I'm not saying logos01 isn't annoying.
[09:48:35] <feep> but we already have a well-working tool for excluding annoying people you don't want to hear, /ignore.
[09:48:57] <saturn2> that's not a well-working tool
[09:49:07] <feep> I think it's significantly underused.
[09:51:03] <saturn2> PapuaHardyNet: this has happened many times with different people involved, but yes i waited to "catch him in the act" as it were
[09:52:01] <saturn2> feep: regarding "I can't let him get away with it" being a bad basis for mod decisions, i really can't figure out what you meant
[09:52:05] <feep> I don't ... I don't have anything to say about that line. I think it already fully supports my point as written.
[09:52:38] <feep> I don't know how to convince you if you think saturn2's last two lines represent good mod behavior.
[09:53:09] <feep> only maybe we just want totally different things out of channel moderation.
[09:53:41] <feep> as an op, your job is to *support logos01*.
[09:53:58] <feep> by the time your phrasing is like "I have to protect the rest of the channel from logos01" things have already gone insanely off the rails.
[09:54:19] <saturn2> i see
[09:54:35] <feep> like, from what I can see the goal here should be to turn logos01 from this path
[09:54:52] <feep> the goal should not be to eat popcorn as he dramatically sails off the cliff
[09:55:10] <feep> To This End, We Use Words First.
[09:55:37] <feep> and then we *keep* using words.
[09:55:58] <adiabatty> feep: there's this one guy in this other tech channel that I was (maybe still am) a mod of and while he's not an asshole, he's random and off-topic and sucks up the attention in the room and is a near-constant drain on the rest of us because none of us give a shit about whatever he's on at any given point
[09:56:00] <feep> in the perfect world, with perfect ops, the location of you in relation to the out of control train should be like spiderman, heroically plastered on the front.
[09:56:03] <saturn2> that makes sense to me when applied to newbies, but logos01 is literally one of the oldest of oldbies
[09:56:08] <adiabatty> but he never gets the boot because all the rest of us are too nice
[09:56:24] <feep> I'm not saying this is the threshold where ops become good, I'm saying it's the unattainable standard to aim for
[09:56:41] <feep> adiabatty: yes but the problem is not --- like, this is *already the fucked up situation I am describing*.
[09:56:51] <feep> it's already evolving in the predictable, fucked up way.
[09:57:06] <feep> when you reach the end of your rope and finally ban him, the ban is not the mistake
[09:57:21] <feep> the preceding hours of failed communication and failed prior steps are the mistake
[09:58:11] <adiabatty> feep: it's choosing one failure mode (bans of a regular) over another (leaving an argumentative nerd who won't change his mind/back down/moves goalposts instead) (assuming logos01 does this)
[09:58:18] <feep> (he doesn't)
[09:58:41] <feep> adiabatty: right, and my disagreement is precisely with this dichotomy, because it is completely made up.
[09:58:58] <feep> the perception is created by a self-reinforcing social failure.
[09:59:18] <Ralith> fyi logos01 was one of the reasons I left for years
[09:59:30] <feep> Ralith: did  you tell him that
[09:59:42] <adiabatty> Ralith: that bad, huh?
[09:59:43] <Ralith> idk, it was years ago
[09:59:46] <saturn2> being someone's social skills coach is a ton of work, and they have to be fully invested in learning in order for it to even work
[09:59:50] <Ralith> he gets pretty obnoxious
[09:59:51] <feep> I agree that logos01 is annoying
[09:59:51] <adiabatty> ^
[10:00:04] <adiabatty> er, I was ^-ing saturn2's comment
[10:00:08] <feep> I think in this channel, of all channels, it is your god damn job as a participant to say "logos01 you are annoying, please tone it down"
[10:00:13] <feep> it can even be the mods who say that
[10:00:21] <Ralith> you can go be his personal social skills coach if you want
[10:00:23] <Ralith> good luck with that
[10:00:40] <feep> that's not at all what I'm proposing.
[10:00:51] <feep> in any case, you *still* have /ignore.
[10:00:52] <Ralith> right, you're proposing everyone else do it instead
[10:01:04] <feep> I'm proposing everyone else use a much more legible skill
[10:01:17] <feep> actually, I'm proposing plain everyone, in general, use a skill of legible social communication
[10:02:05] <feep> because frankly I think that's a core part of the community ethos.
[10:02:51] <nshepperd2> the problem, and the reason saturn2 muted him, is that when logos01 gets going, arguments and links don't work
[10:03:03] <feep> nshepperd2: I have *direct evidence you are wrong*.
[10:03:17] <nshepperd2> he just gets angrier and angrier until he /ignores whoever was arguing with him
[10:03:17] <feep> and people have asserted this like four times now, and I've said it was wrong every time and it keeps coming up
[10:03:20] <adiabatty> feep: a single counterexample doesn't falsify a generalization
[10:03:24] <feep> yes it does!
[10:03:31] <feep> anyway this is why I think it's a self-reinforcing meme 
[10:03:38] <saturn2> i now feel more confident in my decision knowing unambiguously that logos01 has driven away at least one person
[10:03:41] <feep> you stop trying, and then you take the ongoing failure as evidence.
[10:04:23] <feep> saturn2: if you didn't consider that at the time, you shouldn't give yourself points for it
[10:04:44] <feep> in any case, there's still much better solutions like, again, "please stop you're being annoying"
[10:05:26] <Ralith> saturn2 gets points for having good judgement, not for being aware of some specific supporting evidence that the judgement was good
[10:05:34] <feep> nshepperd2: like, on the topic of getting angrier, I have always had very good experience with not being an asshole to him
[10:06:13] <feep> Ralith: sure if we assume op judgment is based on a diffuse unintelligible feeling
[10:06:17] <feep> supposed to be*
[10:06:25] <saturn2> i totally considered it, i just didn't know for sure how many people it was
[10:06:31] <feep> Ralith: saturn2 gets points for successfully determining that logos01 is very annoying
[10:06:44] <feep> it's the entire process between that and the outcome that's fucked.
[10:06:58] <Ralith> people are generally judged directly based on their behavior
[10:07:07] <feep> no apparently not 
[10:07:21] <Ralith> well, I can't speak for you of course
[10:07:25] <feep> apparently people are judged directly, silently, then punished for some made up reason that nobody else is punished for 
[10:07:30] <feep> months later
[10:07:56] <feep> good system
[10:08:04] <adiabatty> feep: if we follow your rule then somebody can be annoying indefinitely if they're annoying and stop and annoying and stop and annoying and stop
[10:08:12] <feep> adiabatty: I disagree.
[10:08:34] <feep> adiabatty: in any case, I mostly brought it up because it was confidently asserted that logos01 *doesn't stop*.
[10:09:58] <feep> like, yes if you silently eat your annoyance and give very oblique hints, the autist doesn't stop
[10:10:07] <feep> then if you punish him for some made up reason, he gets angry
[10:10:11] <feep> how unreasonable
[10:10:54] <feep> to be clear, the reason I get so upset at this is because I'm "not autistic, but I can see it from where I'm standing", it's very much a "there but for the grace of god" case
[10:11:11] <feep> so my take is "I fully understand where logos01 is coming from."
[10:11:12] <adiabatty> I can certainly understand _that_.
[10:11:25] <feep> aand "We of all people should be able to do better."
[10:11:27] <adiabatty> I'm already shit at reading people
[10:11:41] <feep> and then when the reaction is "no actually we did that perfectly well, points for us" I tend to go "no, fuck you"
[10:11:54] <feep> this was a *bad* outcome.
[10:12:06] <feep> it could have been avoided.
[10:12:06] <adiabatty> …on the other hand, I'm very much OK with exclusion, even if I'm the one being excluded not infrequently
[10:12:30] <feep> adiabatty: I'm generally ... *okay* with exclusion, but like, ya'll are my ingroup.
[10:12:35] <feep> if this place excludes me, I am *fucked*.
[10:12:35] <saturn2> i agree it would be better if, theoretically, we could teach logos01 not to do this
[10:13:07] <feep> I think I would be much more charitable if
[10:13:09] <feep> hypothetically
[10:13:11] <feep> you had fucking tried.
[10:14:33] <feep> anyway, need to actually head to work, this is cutting into my morning
[10:14:38] <feep> I still love everyone here
[10:14:51] <saturn2> <3
[10:15:40] <feep> saturn2 you are cool and your view is valid, I just think you're a bad op.
[10:16:45] <feep> maybe it's just an unreasonable standard. I just tend to prefer my ops be legible, and barring legible, passive.
[10:17:03] <saturn2> fair enough
[10:17:04] <feep> it's all preference anyhow.
[10:17:22] <rmmh> ircoping is hard
[10:17:23] <feep> (this is why the real problem is irc's centralization of power)
[10:21:32] * feep returns with half a jacket and a bike helmet
[10:21:52] <feep> oh btw, you know @brazenautomaton on tumblr? 
[10:22:02] <saturn2> yes
[10:22:06] <feep> yeah
[10:22:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: "I don't know how to convince you if you think saturn2's last two lines represent good mod behavior." ... well, they do
[10:22:14] <feep> he's basically my spirit animal.
[10:22:30] <feep> I think ... it doesn't have to be the case that we're the place for the brazens or logos01's of the world
[10:22:33] <feep> but there *has* to be a place.
[10:23:15] <feep> that's ... like, call me a bleeding heart libertarian, but a world where people like that are without any home or support is *fucking awful*.
[10:23:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I think in this channel, of all channels, it is your god damn job as a participant to say "logos01 you are annoying, please tone it down"" ... uh everyone here has said that many times, lol
[10:23:34] <feep> not that the world isn't already fucking awful, but like, everyone socially excluding them is actually one of the problems that *don't
[10:23:40] <feep> * neccessarily get fixed by the singularity
[10:23:44] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: I don't actually think so
[10:23:59] <adiabatty> I certainly haven't said it.
[10:24:06] <saturn2> yes, i don't think they should be denied a place
[10:24:08] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: I think people imagined saying it or obliquely implied it and misremember having felt it as having said it
[10:24:24] <saturn2> and i agree that i should have made my thought process more clear upfront, i will endeavor to be more legible in the future
[10:24:28] <feep> thank you
[10:24:38] <feep> that makes me feel a lot better.
[10:25:20] * feep resumes afking
[10:25:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: I think that the mod behavior patterns in here are like 50%, if not more, of the reasons why this channel is sane and cool despite, you know... the rest of the internet... and the world
[10:25:40] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: oh, in *general*, I agree.
[10:25:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Also I've identified the fundamental difference between your view of moderation and saturn2's/mine/everyone else's
[10:25:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> You want corrective authority, we want selective authority
[10:26:11] <feep> I want most of all, continuous enforcement.
[10:26:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's tangential
[10:26:21] <feep> no that's essential
[10:26:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nah
[10:26:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> btw
[10:26:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> "that's ... like, call me a bleeding heart libertarian, but a world where people like that are without any home or support is *fucking awful*." - this is how we get the Bay Area
[10:27:00] <adiabatty> ^
[10:27:14] <feep> I don't think the problem of the bay area is that they don't kick enough people out.
[10:27:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[10:27:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is
[10:27:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> 100% that is precisely the problem
[10:27:30] <feep> I think the problem is that they don't have a plan to help people.
[10:27:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, we don't have to theorize; we actually know very well and clearly where this sort of thinking ends up
[10:27:36] <adiabatty> the bay area has many problems, but "they don't kick people out" is definitely one of the big ones
[10:27:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> No they do
[10:27:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> They have many plans
[10:27:49] <feep> afaict their plans are all passive
[10:27:57] <feep> because they're too offhand to take *corrective action*
[10:28:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Their plans are bad, but more importantly, their plans are *combined with a policy of not kicking people out*
[10:28:10] <feep> I don't mind corrective action, I mind discontinuous illegible corrective action.
[10:28:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that ruins them irrevocably
[10:28:26] <PapuaHardyNet> this entire discussion has made me very conflicted: obviously I don't think saturn2 should be banning someone when they are the one annoyed by them, and yet, obormot's arguments are all very sensible
[10:28:36] <saturn2> i mean, i do try to be "corrective" whenever it seems reasonably likely to work
[10:28:44] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: that's how it feels to be witnessing a battle over framing. :P
[10:28:49] <adiabatty> PapuaHardyNet: he was not _the one_ annoyed; he was one of many
[10:29:06] <PapuaHardyNet> oh I understand, which is why I believe obormot makes a lot of sense
[10:29:24] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: you should be careful that ... like, when you are seeing a debate, you are not seeing primarily arguments going back and forth
[10:29:32] <feep> especially if both people are raising good points
[10:29:47] <feep> that usually indicates the fight is more about like, the domain in which the debate should be being decided.
[10:29:55] <feep> and that level is usually implicit.
[10:30:17] <PapuaHardyNet> i'll keep that in mind
[10:30:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> The domain in which the debate should be decided is the one in which I am right, because I am in fact right
[10:30:20] <feep> :)
[10:30:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Obviously :p
[10:30:58] <feep> see, obormot sometimes fucking annoys me, and I don't say he should stop because I don't think he would
[10:31:00] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: but like
[10:31:22] <feep> you can be confident that you *will* get warning from me before I'd ever get so far as to escalate that.
[10:31:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> I was already confident in that, because Logos01 got like a million warnings
[10:31:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or at least five, which is pretty much the same thing
[10:31:57] <feep> my being annoyed is in the first range a me issue, if it gets to the level where I make it a you issue, I will *tell you this overtly*.
[10:32:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Cool
[10:33:21] <feep> anyway re la, I don't think the issue is that they don't kick people out, it's that they don't take any of the dozens of steps that could take place *before* kicking peope out either.
[10:33:53] <feep> the problem is not that the curve ends too quickly, or that it's too sharp, the problem is that the curve is the fucking x axis. :P
[10:35:00] * feep CLOSES THE LAPTOP, swear to god this place is addicting tho

[11:09:47] <PapuaHardyNet> does centralization of ownership of an asset affect its value? say, XRP is mostly owned by Ripple Labs, while bitcoin is more distributed in ownership. Does this make bitcoin more valuable than XRP, all else considered equal?
[11:10:25] <V> the value of an asset is determined by whether elon musk shills it on twitter
[11:10:54] <V> (actually, even then, this has knock-on effects on surrounding assets, but the ones he mentions explicitly get affected the most)
[11:12:29] <PapuaHardyNet> coin nihilism, eh? That doesn't work in the long term
[11:12:30] <V> more generally, I don't think you're going to see that much of a relation between centralisation/decentralisation and value, because cryptocurrencies are all risky & strongly hype-driven, so you're more likely to be looking at whether they have a marketing department and lots of people who're trying to increase the value by word of mouth
[11:14:28] <PapuaHardyNet> let me reiterate - everything else, including the hype, is considered equal for both the assets in question
[11:14:35] <saturn2> otoburb: i think he's just gotten busier. he still pops by now and then
[11:15:01] <otoburb> saturn2: you mean people here have lives outside of the channel? that's blasphemy
[11:15:12] <otoburb> but ... glad to hear
[11:15:46] <PapuaHardyNet> there are two ways this could go: either because the less distributed asset is scarce, it will be of a higher value, or because it is less distributed, it is trusted less since people think prices are dependent on the whale's movements
[11:15:58] <PapuaHardyNet> so... it all boils down to marketing?
[11:16:09] <otoburb> PapuaHardyNet: Digital asset narratives favour decentralization at the moment. But the winds could shift. 
[11:16:56] <otoburb> XRP is a hard one to compare because it's the furthest away from "all else being equal", unless Bitcoin Core lied about having banking relationships early on (i.e. shitty marketing)
[11:17:56] <PapuaHardyNet> I just used XRP as an example because it has no organic method of distributing its assets towards users of the blockchain, unlike proof-of-work currencies
[11:18:18] <V> PapuaHardyNet: I mean, I don't trust their value to be dependent on anything sane, given e.g. the tether fraud

[13:06:01] <PapuaHardyNet> considering buying a 500$ pre-corebooted Thinkpad X230
[13:07:13] <PapuaHardyNet> its the cheapest way for me to get a corebooted laptop right now and I plan on not buying another laptop for years (do plan to build a pc for deep learning though)
[13:07:31] <PapuaHardyNet> the X230 has 16GB ram and a 230GB SSd
[13:07:45] <PapuaHardyNet> is this an extremely dumb decision or acceptable
[13:08:30] <feep[work]> it's ... *okay*?
[13:09:09] <feep[work]> i5 is solid, I think processors haven't sped up a *crazy* amount
[13:10:07] <feep[work]> the drive may be the biggest factor
[13:10:40] <PapuaHardyNet> I use a 2TB external HDD for all my media and backups, so the SSD isn't a problem
[13:10:57] <feep[work]> I mean purely as a daily use thing
[13:11:18] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[13:11:21] <PapuaHardyNet> oh no, my current XPS13 has 256GB SSD, I have no issues daily driving it
[13:11:50] <feep[work]> what's the issue with it? not enough ram?
[13:12:10] <PapuaHardyNet> I need another laptop for my sister and plan to give this one to her
[13:12:29] <feep[work]> oic
[13:12:35] <feep[work]> it's probably fine then, I guess
[13:12:50] <PapuaHardyNet> thank you, I'm now more confident about this decision
[13:12:56] <feep[work]> I will say that I bought a laptop for 2000€ three years ago (that was fucking expensive for me)
[13:13:07] <feep[work]> and I repeatedly thought "fuck, I am incredibly glad I shelled out for a really good laptop"
[13:13:25] <feep[work]> but I don't know how much of that is just the m2 ssd
[13:13:40] <PapuaHardyNet> I'll go overkill on a desktop tower once NVIDIA 40 series releases (or I get my hands on a 3090 easily)
[13:13:46] <feep[work]> that's fair.
[13:13:57] <PapuaHardyNet> it's a barbell strategy, minimal laptop and maximal deep learning workstation
[13:13:59] <feep[work]> I use mine as a daily driver, so I really appreciate the marginal speedup.
[13:14:17] <PapuaHardyNet> right, it makes sense
[13:14:28] <feep[work]> I will say that having a really high-tuned main system that reacts snappily under load is
[13:14:31] <feep[work]> *fucking tight*.
[13:14:55] <PapuaHardyNet> that's what I'm aiming to build, yeah :)
[13:14:59] <feep[work]> but that said, for $500 I think the thinkpad sounds good. main issue may be the shitty display.
[13:15:25] <PapuaHardyNet> I barely do anything more than code so the display is acceptable for me
[13:15:30] <PapuaHardyNet> (oh god I have no life)

[13:18:35] <feep[work]> I find context switches motivating

[13:27:17] <PapuaHardyNet> it's nice that this channel is socially gated enough for people to be of a certain threshold of age and mental maturity
[13:27:34] <feep[work]> yeah I can see that

[13:29:32] <PapuaHardyNet> funnily enough, I found lesswrong after reading gwern's spaced repetition post (not 100% sure of course, but this is the most likely cause)
[13:30:18] <feep[work]> oyeah I have no idea how I found the blog
[13:32:14] <feep[work]> probably just read a page and got addicted
[13:33:25] <PapuaHardyNet> that was such a long time ago, it couldn't have been reddit. perhaps some other link aggregate site

[14:40:17] <feep[work]> and it has a dearth of ~maths~, only one subscript index
[14:40:28] <feep[work]> synthmeat: and at any rate, it's pretty obvious
[14:40:58] <feep[work]> uh, context: we have a central old-ass database that changes are written to, and we need to space out changes for the same key by half a sec to avoid corruption
[14:41:18] <feep[work]> but we don't want to wait between every update because then we'd fall behind the data stream
[14:41:22] <feep[work]> and also there's operations that affect multiple keys
[14:41:44] <feep[work]> so I have this MultiDelayQueue, where you can queue a task for n keys and it will run in order per queue and also with a minimum delay between tasks
[14:42:52] <feep[work]> and the impl has a small proof to show that there's always at least one task 'ready' (not blocked by a previous task): assign an integer in sequence to each task as it is added (insert index, i), then the tasks in each key's queue are monotonically ordered with respect to i
[14:43:23] <feep[work]> so take the queued task with minimum i, and it is not blocked (by contradiction), so there's at least one task that is unblocked
[14:44:36] <feep[work]> (which isn't necessarily the one that is actually executed - because another may have a smaller needed delay value - but the set is nonzero, which is why we're allowed to find the soonest one and run it.)

[14:56:29] <synthmeat> sounds like google keep, at least what they released initially
[14:57:13] <synthmeat> could you elaborate on "ms word textboxes ..." thing?
[14:58:01] <bildramer> basically I want 2d text. click somewhere to the right of whatever text is in a file, and be able to type, and the two blobs of text don't affect each other
[14:58:24] <feep[work]> gimp?
[14:58:37] <bildramer> and preferably not just a hacky way to have a text file full of blank spaces
[14:59:17] <bildramer> well, yeah, I could use actual word, or the libreoffice version, or some image drawing application, but my goal is to be able to select/edit/type with one or zero clicks, that's the only problem with word

[15:01:36] <bildramer> maybe emacs or vi

[15:12:58] <bildramer> I guess a sticky note program could do, as long as it stores all sticky notes in a file, and can have two sticky notes one on top of the other all the time, and doesn't eat ram like it's groceries
[15:13:27] <rsaarelm> And you need to figure out the UI idioms for pushing and popping into the note subspaces.

[17:26:15] <rsaarelm> Maybe when you're in high school your social circle might be people who go hang out on a hpmor forum or something and you think, hey, random people can be sorta smart and you can talk to them about stuff, and then you start going into worklife and suddenly the people you interact with might be a lot more randomly selected.
[17:26:34] <rsaarelm> Already in university it's going to be different than some specific subculture forum.
[17:26:46] <PapuaHardyNet> I was talking about mental maturity, that was the point I was making - it isn't just about age
[17:27:12] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, the subculture where you encounter the person matters.
[17:27:16] <rsaarelm> Yeah, there are differences obv.
[17:27:36] <rsaarelm> But I don't think it's easier to find smart 16 year olds than it is to find smart 21 year olds.
[17:28:24] <PapuaHardyNet> agreed. it's less about the age, and more about the person
[17:28:44] <rsaarelm> Well, okay, there is one thing, you can end up randomly talking to people who are going to be career tracked into the professional-managerial caste and will soon know to never talk about anything over open channels while they're still high-school aged or undergraduates, but not so much after that.
[17:28:59] *** Joins: feep[work] (~mathis@217.64.163.97)
[17:29:44] <PapuaHardyNet> there are people groomed like that? taught to never talk about anything over open channels, as you put it
[17:30:13] <rsaarelm> They'll pick it up from the surrounding culture I imagine.
[17:30:38] <rsaarelm> Also they'll just get different places to hang out than online social circles.
[17:31:37] <PapuaHardyNet> well, you'll find smart 16 year olds in very niche places such as, say, coreboot IRC, or imageboards focused on tech, and you wouldn't know they are 16 unless they tell you (aside from the usual teenage immaturity that usually is easily detectable)
[17:32:04] <PapuaHardyNet> I think I was 16 or 17 when I first began idling on and off on this channel in fact
[17:32:30] <rsaarelm> That's the only option you have as a 16-year-old for hanging around grown-up conversations.
[17:34:26] <PapuaHardyNet> unfortunately, I agree
[17:34:37] <rsaarelm> Then I dunno, people go hang out with Peter Thiel instead of here when they grow up and make it big.
[17:35:07] <rsaarelm> (There's probably something in between "idle in IRC" and "hang out with Peter Thiel" but I'm less clear about the details there)
[17:35:14] <PapuaHardyNet> Vitalik Buterin was 17 when his father introduced him to Bitcoin and the Bitcoin whitepaper
[17:35:59] <PapuaHardyNet> within a few years he went from a super smart teenager to someone who made a name for himself by writing in magazines about it
[17:36:40] <PapuaHardyNet> His Ethereum project was why he got the Thiel Fellowship - but the most important thing here is that his dad gave him the opportunities to get started down this direction
[17:37:13] <PapuaHardyNet> getting lucky is very important if you want to "hang out with Peter Thiel" as a 20 something if that's your threshold for making it big
[17:38:37] <rsaarelm> It's more like, it's pretty much invisible when people end up doing normal stuff instead of broadcasting their stuff on something like IRC, but sometimes they end up in the Thiel penumbra and that's notable enough it's again visible in open channels.
[17:39:15] <rsaarelm> Like, Konkvistador used to hang out here, now he's got his whatsit-thinktank thing that I don't know if it's known to be Thiel-funded but I assumed it is.
[17:39:27] <PapuaHardyNet> huh. don't you think people who end up in the Thiel penumbra are people who successfully market themselves (or are marketed)?
[17:39:37] <PapuaHardyNet> I have no idea who Konkvistador is.
[17:41:11] <rsaarelm> Samo Burja.

[17:41:48] <feepbot> rsaarelm: I have last seen Konkvistador 317 weeks, 5 days ago saying "JOIN".
[17:42:20] <PapuaHardyNet> 6 years?
[17:42:33] <RiversHaveWings> I sort of remember that nick
[17:42:36] <rsaarelm> Yeah, sounds about right.
[17:42:53] <rsaarelm> He was pretty active on old lesswrong around 2010.
[17:43:00] <RiversHaveWings> Oh, feepbot carries over the history from the old channel?
[17:48:31] <rsaarelm> So a Konky will be on #lesswrong when he's 20, and then he'll be running his thinktank and not hang out at IRC at 30.
[17:48:59] <rsaarelm> Give it some time though and we'll start to have retired interesting people in IRC channels who again have time to hang out online and yell crazy stuff at random people.

[17:57:43] <RiversHaveWings> oh?
[17:57:49] <RiversHaveWings> he could do it anonymously
[17:58:41] <dbohdan> Right, but if a few people knew, it probably wouldn't stay secret
[17:59:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> He could use a proxy

[18:04:47] <rsaarelm> IRC is growing more obscure, so there's less people trying to run weird scams or troll ops over IRC these days.
[18:04:51] <rsaarelm> So I guess that's a feature.
[18:06:46] <dbohdan> Although maybe I am miscalibrated.  Maybe it's more like "don't be Peter Thiel or Elon Musk"?
[18:07:18] <rsaarelm> Though I guess the endpoint might be nobody but a bunch of senior citizens describing their bodily functions, as someone described the state of the current ham radio scene.
[18:07:53] <rsaarelm> I'd think name recognition drops pretty fast past the Musk, Bezos, Thiel level.
[18:08:09] <dbohdan> Thiel and Musk wouldn't have a normal IRC experience, but perhaps a CEO of a pretty major (non-public?) company still could
[18:08:45] <dbohdan> rsaarelm: Yes, definitely
[18:09:05] <rsaarelm> Yeah, though I'd guess regular CEOs are also the sort of people who have a very ingrained sense to never be interesting over public channels for fun.
[18:09:22] <dbohdan> Yeah

[23:42:43] <pie_> dbohdan: im not surprised
[23:43:26] <pie_> dbohdan: but if i process all the queries myself and dont run it 24h/day how bad could it be right? :P
[23:43:33] <ggreer> I was worried about the risk of long covid before vaccination. now I'm not worried at all. I assume pretty much everyone will get infected eventually. it'll become another strain like the flu
[23:43:42] <mjr> kuudes, I assume by "wait time" you mean time after the second dose. I don't think you should worry overmuch for yourself. (THL btw considers you fully vaccinated after a week from the second shot.)
[23:43:45] <pie_> dbohdan: i would imagine they throw captchas at you once in a while
[23:45:14] <mjr> (or you were trying to say "weeks")
[23:45:27] <dbohdan> pie_: I don't know about that.  They may just silently flag you for review if your activity is statistically unusual.
[23:45:53] <dbohdan> pie_: They have an API
[23:46:15] <dbohdan> pie_: https://ahrefs.com/api/subscription -- not cheap
[23:46:15] <Robomot> Plans & Pricing - Ahrefs API (Ahrefs API enables using our backlinks data in your applications.)
[23:46:31] <pie_> i dont really get the difference between their integrations and normal api thing https://help.ahrefs.com/en/articles/72096-is-it-possible-to-use-your-api-functions-with-a-usual-ahrefs-subscription
[23:46:32] <Robomot> Is it possible to use your API functions with a usual Ahrefs subscription? | Help Center - Ahrefs (Discover the difference between Ahrefs subscriptions and Ahrefs API subscriptions.)
[23:46:49] <pie_> dbohdan: the integrations thing comes with the normal subscription
[23:48:09] <dbohdan> pie_: The difference seems to be that with an API subscription you get the right to resell their results
[23:49:20] <dbohdan> I wonder what the marginal value of a service like Ahrefs is
[23:49:42] <dbohdan> I could write one
[23:50:17] <kuudes> mjr, I am way over 2 weeks since 2nd shot, wife will be t+12d of 2nd shot on monday
[23:50:17] <pie_>  apparently they crawl a lot and have BIG DB
[23:50:20] <pie_> or something
[23:50:20] <pie_> idk
[23:51:08] <mjr> Right. Well anyway, by THL standards that's fully vaccinated (and the graph I saw at some point seems to support that).
[23:51:18] *** Joins: srhm (~ascii@user/srhm)
[23:53:13] <dbohdan> pie_: Yeah, I imagine they have high operating costs.  (But low expenditure per client.)
[23:53:44] <pie_> that would imply they shouldnt mind getting some more clients for cheaper so idk
[23:54:06] <pie_> though i dont mind that its a bit obscure, maybe that means it turns shitty slower
[23:56:02] <kuudes> mjr, yes
[23:56:18] <kuudes> here in oulu we are currently seeing surge of +50% cases per day
[23:57:25] <kuudes> so far I see the options:
[23:57:32] <kuudes> 0) do not alter current - wife goes to near-work 2 days a week to meet patients, wfh 2 days/week, I work from home, kids go to daycare currently and school 2 weeks from now
[23:57:32] <dbohdan> pie_: Is it obscure?  It's the top result "what links to my site" for me in Google, Bing, and DDG.  It has 45 likes on <https://alternativeto.net/software/ahrefs-com/about/>, which seems good for its category.

[23:57:40] <kuudes> 1) full lockdown - wife demands to work from home fully or get those days off without salary or quit, kids taken home
[23:57:49] <kuudes> 2) tighten by cutting all nonwork, nonschool, nondaycare contacts
[23:57:55] <kuudes> 3) loosen by removing personal restrictions
[23:58:01] <kuudes> 4) something else
[23:58:14] <pie_> dbohdan: i dont objectively know. I didnt think to check something like that
[23:58:50] <dbohdan> pie_: FWIW, I also knew about it and had used it (for free)
[23:59:11] <pie_> dbohdan: yeah but we're special :P
