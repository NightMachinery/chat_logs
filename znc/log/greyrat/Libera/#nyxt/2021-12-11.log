[00:13:58] <TheInformaticist> Reading your article about Nyxt and Emacs. Very interesting.
[00:18:26] <TheInformaticist> Emacs needs to be re-implemented in a more modern Lisp. How about Schemacs? (copyright The Informaticist, 2021).
[00:20:14] <jmercouris> :-D
[00:20:27] <jmercouris> CL I think is very modern
[00:21:10] <TheInformaticist> I know. Does the Nyxt browser have a text buffer feature?
[00:22:25] <TheInformaticist> In other words, can I edit an ascii file inside Nyxt, out of the box?
[00:28:42] <jmercouris> TheInformaticist: yes
[00:28:49] <jmercouris> It is in fact possible
[00:29:00] <jmercouris> It’s called open file with editor or something
[00:29:06] <jmercouris> I’m afk atm so I can’t recall
[00:32:22] <TheInformaticist> OK. Sounds promising. I'll let you know how it's going in about a week. TTFN!

[03:39:07] <pedro-delfino> If I understood your question correctly, unlike Emacs, there is *no* major/minor mode hierarchy on Nyxt
[03:42:41] <KarlJoad> So there is no way for a single style to affect all types of buffers? Say moving to dark mode background.

[04:31:47] <jmercouris> KarlJoad: this is possible
[04:32:12] <jmercouris> KarlJoad: the define-configuration form can accept multiple classes
[04:33:27] <jmercouris> (define-configuration ‘(tomato zucchini) ((taste-rating “delicious”)))
[04:34:15] <jmercouris> Of course in your case it might be something like (define-configuration ‘(buffer prompt-buffer) ((style “some style”)))
[04:34:24] <jmercouris> Not nearly as interesting as tomatoes and zucchini’s
[04:34:30] <jmercouris> But that is a discussion for another time
[04:34:52] <jmercouris> I should also note I typed this on a phone, it’s just pseudocode, I probably used the wrong type of apostrophe etc
[04:34:57] <jmercouris> But it should give you an idea
[04:54:22] <KarlJoad> Gotcha. Watching through a video about Nyxt that was posted just today. It answered my question.
