[00:57:58] <JordiGH> What's the right way to automate a request for a big CSV? It takes a while to generate.
[00:58:25] <JordiGH> So user requests it via an HTTP JSON request and then what... I give them a url to poll to see when it's ready?
[00:58:48] <c355e3b> I would have them give you a webhook instead of polling

[01:14:50] <rbasak> REST would suggest a POST that redirects you to a URL at which the result will appear (there are probably HTTP result codes for "not ready yet" and "expired"). I would make the webhook an "extra" to save polling. Easier to debug then.

[01:26:49] <JordiGH> I'll see if the client wants a webhook.
[01:27:02] <cot> Is this (i.e., using a squarish variant of a font as italic) common elsewhere, or is this a lone case? I've never encountered this before

[17:49:15] <c355e3b> Why can't I have a spinlock
[17:49:16] <dutchie> i think "pure rust" is a distinct usage from the FP-specific notion of "purity"

[18:02:20] <gwozniak> be content without them
[18:02:23] <c355e3b> I feel like it would be better if `release` required a second tag

[18:16:08] <epilys> are we talking about "new version of X software" or "here is X software" posts?
[18:16:47] <ignaloidas> it depends on the release I think, e.g. I have posted quite a few of Godot releases, but I'm looking if they are interesting not only for those using it before posting it
[18:16:50] <epilys> the former is out of topic; it's a mailing list announcement not an article
[18:17:24] <epilys> The release announcement could highlight new features in depth; I guess that's on topic if it's properly titled
[18:17:34] <Guest16> is there any way to block all other websites except few? in windows, hosts file need website addressses that need to be blocked.
