[01:18:30] <Kabouik> I came up with this after some CSS work: https://0x0.st/o-GP.png
[01:19:29] <Kabouik> But this is still not perfect because it forces me to start my selection range from 366
[01:19:43] <Kabouik> Sorry I forgot to put a title on the slider in the screenshot, it's the bottom one
[01:21:27] <Kabouik> I don't see how to workaround the impossibility to exclude boundaries from the selected range, except maybe with two distinct slider, but that is a severe ergonomy cost
[01:22:08] <Kabouik> What would be great would be a circular slider with two handles, and one could slide the selected range past begin and end boundaries
[01:23:06] <Kabouik> Which would allow selecting ydays from end of year to beginning of year (overlapping two years) and also within one year (not including beginning or end of year).
[01:27:28] <rickyrick> wat
[01:27:41] <rickyrick> How does your slider work for leap years

[01:34:46] <Kabouik> Typically I don't care about exact dates, so whether yday 60 is Feb 29th or March 1st is not important for me
[01:35:15] <Kabouik> What matters in my case is the number of days in the range
[01:35:29] <Kabouik> But yeah that is something that should be considered, indeed
[01:35:32] *** Quits: eliocamp3 (~eliocamp@user/eliocamp) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[01:37:20] <rickyrick> Why not just do 01-01 to 12-31
[01:38:42] <Kabouik> Because this does not allow me to something like [Dec-01, Dec-31, Jan-01, Feb-01]
[01:38:59] <Kabouik> i.e., if I want both december and january in my range, then I have to include all months of the year
[01:39:08] <Kabouik> Which is an issue if I want to filter only winters
[01:39:51] <rickyrick> o i c
[01:40:00] <rickyrick> Why not have two separate sliders; one for start and one for end
[01:40:07] <Kabouik> The problem with dateInputRange really is it is only useful for dates (including years), which is not always what we need
[01:40:07] <rickyrick> If start < end, it's the conventional [start, end]
[01:40:16] <rickyrick> If end < start then you wrap around the end instead
[01:40:23] <rickyrick> [0, start] and [end, 12-31]
[01:40:34] <Kabouik> And slider ranges for a series from 1 to 366 does not allow seasonal filtering either because seasons overlap both 1st and 366 dats
[01:40:36] <Kabouik> days*
[01:41:01] <Kabouik> That is what I do in the screenshot I think, or are you referring to something else?
[01:41:52] <rickyrick> o i c
[01:42:06] <Kabouik> But that is still an issue, my UI has to force a choice that the user may not want: either include end of year and beginning of year in the selected range, or prevent wrapping end of year and beginning of year
[01:42:08] <rickyrick> I assume you can specify both 75 to 363 as well as 363 to 75
[01:42:11] <Kabouik> A circular slider would allow that
[01:42:16] <Kabouik> Exactly
[01:42:26] <Kabouik> That is what I would want
[01:42:42] <rickyrick> ¯\_(ツ)_?¯
[01:43:12] <rickyrick> TBH I personally hate circular sliders
[01:43:23] <rickyrick> Used too many VSTs with that shit
[01:44:53] <Kabouik> I hate them too but if they have sane defaults in the UI and can be shifted without moving handles, it makes them more survivable
[01:45:05] <Kabouik> https://dreamrs.github.io/shinyWidgets/reference/figures/knob.gif if that could take two values, that would work nicely really
[01:45:53] <rickyrick> >knob.gif
[01:46:04] <rickyrick> I guess what you'd be looking for is a double-sided knob :^)
[01:46:54] <Kabouik> I imagine this would be the exact same issue for time of day actually. Say you want to monitor temperature data from 11pm to 4am, the circular gif allows that. And still, the same ui and application would allow monitoring 10am to 2pm. I think there's a real use there. I'll open an issue at ShinyWidgets just in case they deem it relevant
[01:47:04] <rickyrick> Honestly I'd just replace the start and end handles on your existing slider with [ and ] and call it a day
[01:47:25] <Kabouik> Can you elaborate? I'm not sure I understand
[01:47:49] <rickyrick> https://i.ibb.co/6ZPqRVg/M2tr-QGycajo-Jd-Ja-ZNc-Om.png
[01:47:51] <rickyrick> Something that looks like that
[01:48:35] <Kabouik> Right, I should do that to make my current UI less ambiguous. 
[01:48:58] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[01:49:03] <Kabouik> However that's still an issue: most of my samples are in February, so forcibly including end of december and beginning of January might be an issue for users who want a shallow time range.
[01:49:39] *** Quits: Vojtaeus (~vojta@user/vojtaeus) (Quit: Odcházím...)
[01:50:09] <rickyrick> wat
[01:51:42] <Kabouik> I have samples from say October to March, every year. So I need a way to make a October-to-March range (hence my reverted slider). However, since range limits are impossible to exclude, that also means my range will always start from December 31st at the latest. This is an issue if some users only want to visualize February samples.
[01:52:40] <rickyrick> ._.
[01:53:00] <rickyrick> Wouldn't it be [October, December] union [December, March]?
[01:53:49] <Kabouik> But that means two distinct sliders, plus a way to disable either of them individually, which makes the UI more complicated
[01:53:53] <Kabouik> Let alone the code :<
[01:54:00] <rickyrick> wat
[01:54:04] <rickyrick> I thought that's what your current slider does
[01:55:18] <Kabouik> My slider can only do [October,  March]: 
[01:55:29] <rickyrick> Oh
[01:55:33] <rickyrick> Your screenshot was just a mockup?
[01:55:47] <Kabouik> No, I think I fail to explain properly. It's an actual UI and it works
[01:55:52] <rickyrick> ._.
[01:56:03] <Kabouik> But you can't disable the right handle, and it's stuck at 366 max
[01:56:33] <Kabouik> Which means Dec 31 is included, and then the left hand only allows moving from Jan-01 to whatever later yday
[01:56:51] <Kabouik> So there is now way to do [Jan, Feb] for instance. This would be possible with a regular (non inverted) slider.
[01:56:59] <Kabouik> s/now way/no way
[01:57:00] <rickyrick> Oh I see it's permanently inverted
[01:57:17] <Kabouik> Yes, I don't know how to make that dynamic
[01:57:19] <rickyrick> As in you can't move the right [ handle past the left ] handle
[01:57:29] <Kabouik> That would be some significant coding I guess
[01:57:33] <rickyrick> Yeah I bet
[01:57:46] <rickyrick> I've never used Shiny tbh
[01:58:03] <rickyrick> The last time I made any significant UI was in VB6 :^)
[01:58:04] <Kabouik> Actually if the base sliderInput() allowed moving sliders individually from left to right (and overlapping them), that'd work. But right now they can't cross each other.
[01:58:26] <rickyrick> Add checkbox for invert :^)
[01:58:37] <Kabouik> The backend would be complicated still :<
[01:58:42] <rickyrick> ya
[01:58:44] <Kabouik> I'd have to come up with conditions everywhere
[02:00:17] <Kabouik> In an earlier iteration, I had two distinct sliders. That works too, and it does allow making two different intervals like [Oct-Dec] union [Dec-Feb], or [Feb-Fev] union [Feb-Feb] if you only want February
[02:00:39] <Kabouik> But go explain your users they have to move the two sliders to February if they want only February, instead of just one
[02:06:26] <rickyrick> https://i.ibb.co/v4mRL07/6vp-B1frx-V1-Tdw1-Udr66b.png
[02:06:39] <rickyrick> I can't believe I still have VB6 installed lel
[02:14:48] <Kabouik> Yeah, that is what I did with the two sliders, except it's not that clear with the Shiny UI because you don't have that red line unambiguously showing what is the current range

[02:15:57] <Kabouik> So you have a "Range start" where you're supposed to select high ydays for December for instance, and a "Range end" where you're supposed to select low ydays (February), which will be counter intuitive
