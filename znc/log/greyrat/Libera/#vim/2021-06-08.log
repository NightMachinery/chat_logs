[01:21:47] <kek_> hi, if I install e.g. nuxtjs locally I can choose a linter. Now I use vim. How exactly can a lib like nuxtjs give me the linter? wouldn't that be something provided by vim or a plugin for vim?
[01:22:36] <romainl> what linter?
[01:23:24] <romainl> kek_: ^
[01:23:33] <kek_> romainl, ah I think I actually solved my confusion
[01:23:54] <romainl> how?
[01:24:46] <kek_> yeah I'm good nevermind thanks - it just installs a linter on nodejs/compiler and then that thing should tell you what's wrong when compiling. I confused it with something like an LSP in vim directly.

[03:50:18] <kybr> correction on my lines: s/your/you're/ ... UDP/OSC is a common standard in musical systems. sending to localhost mostly (but sometimes a remote host). need lowest communication latency. don't want to invoke external program. will probably use the built-in perl.

[04:01:38] <SvenG> 9vim has builtin perl? :-)
[04:03:04] <SvenG> (i always thought it was just some *interface* to perl..)
[04:04:11] <gehn> well, vim has built in <MANY_LANGUAGES> provided you compile vim with support for that given language
[04:04:24] <gehn> perl, python, ruby and even scheme
[04:04:30] <gehn> at least, there might be a few more
[04:04:39] <SvenG> oh.. i have seen that
[04:04:50] <SvenG> language *support*
[04:05:04] <SvenG> just not any language built *into* 9vim
[04:05:13] <gehn> or more likely, provided your *distro* compiled vim with support for that language
[04:05:22] <gehn> SvenG, well, right, other than VimL aka vimscript
[04:05:44] <SvenG> that one seems to be the *only* built-in one, isnt it?
[04:05:50] <gehn> neovim does things differently, but also has similarly support for a variety of other langs
[04:06:04] <SvenG> so i heard
[04:06:05] <gehn> I mean, I guess it depends on what we mean by built in
[04:06:07] <SvenG> .. here at vimberlin
[04:06:12] <SvenG> .. and vimfest
[04:06:21] <gehn> having a full compiler/parser/lexer for a given language, other than vimscript, no I don't think so
[04:06:22] <SvenG> .. from this justin guy
[04:06:30] <gehn> but being linked against libpython makes python pretty close to built-in

[04:08:22] <gehn> like if you were to statically link libpython into vim, arguably the python compiler/interpreter is literally then built-in, it's inside the vim binary itself

[04:12:17] <kybr> gehn: yes. when i said built-in, i meant the +perl/dyn in vim --version
[04:16:05] <kybr> the lua+libuv API in neovim made it pretty easy to send portions of buffers via UDP. i'm getting back to vim and i'd hoped i would see some low-level socket access via vimscript. none, but maybe that's a good decision.

[11:16:19] <dmelani> habamax: a weird mode used to manage todo lists, agendas, note keeping and whatnot. i haven't found anything quite as good for vim yet
[11:17:31] <spyt> as much as I love org-mode, the dissonance I experience when I use emacs makes it not worth it for me. And I've tried it all: handcrafted config, spacemacs, doom-emacs
[11:17:35] <habamax> I know, I would be really surprised if something emacs bound (and only needed there) would be better implemented somewhere else
[11:18:12] <habamax> and org-mode is over over over praised

[11:28:31] <R2robot> incomplete, but still. hehe
[11:29:07] <romainl> maybe if hey had an OS to back them up
[11:32:23] <igemnace> with the (slim) subset of features i used in org-mode (agenda, todos, tables), my impression is that its strength is in being a plain-text format (and the simplicity and performance that entails), while still having interactivity with a lot of effort on making sure the experience isn't buggy
[11:32:53] *** Quits: romainl (~Adium@81.54.245.213.rev.sfr.net) (Quit: Leaving.)
[11:33:35] <igemnace> for example: tables. you'd expect that it'd definitely be doable to draft out ASCII tables and code some basic actions such as "add row" using plaintext manipulation (even w/ tools such as unix cut, grep, etc)
[11:34:50] <igemnace> but when you actually try to put it together yourself, you'll quickly find that there are limits to the manipulation, and it leads to leaky abstractions. edge cases where the table generation misbehaves, for example, and it chokes on the output
[11:36:26] <igemnace> org-mode's magic is in the attention to detail to all those edge cases such that there are no leaky abstractions at all (or at least, that's how it felt to me). like it was a perfect table implementation straight out of a spreadsheet program, but it's in plaintext so you know the magic is in the parse-process-output routine
[11:39:03] <igemnace> i don't think emacs has to do with it, fundamentally. if it were a different editor with the same level of programmability, and the creators of org-mode were just as motivated to implement it *there*, you'd still be left with the same quality org-mode product

[11:55:59] <igemnace> of course, semantic table building (e.g. how you'd do it in html, latex, or markdown) is always going to be better than building tables ad hoc via UI. because it's exact. you won't immediately see the actual table straight in your plaintext, though
[11:57:31] <igemnace> which is fine, of course; pretty easy to render it out and view it in a proper viewer. but then, that's where you'd have to admit org-mode is pushing itself, even if it doesn't seem "proper": it wants the user to have tables in plaintext, and it takes care of issues

[12:05:33] <igemnace> o/
[12:05:43] <igemnace> been a while
[12:06:02] <habamax> igemnace: to be frank I am not sure if restructured text or markdown would be able to handle those "business" document tables
[12:06:23] <habamax> but asciidoc(tor) does it with ease
[12:06:36] <igemnace> habamax: what use case are you thinking of?
[12:07:07] <habamax> solution design documents and alike
[12:07:44] <igemnace> rest ive never used. but markdown at least, you usually process into html, and there you have more control

[12:08:28] <igemnace> (whether marked up or not)
[12:08:36] <habamax> asciidoctor is my saviour :)
[12:08:54] <igemnace> never heard of it before. bookmarked for learning
[12:09:34] <igemnace> ah, it's a markup language that *also* processes into html?
[12:09:40] <habamax> it is markdown done right
[12:09:59] <habamax> html, pdf what I use
[12:10:29] <habamax> and docx with pandoc
[12:10:34] <igemnace> funny how html has all the semantics down right, people just seem averse to it in general because of the verbosity of nested xml
[12:11:06] <habamax> igemnace: there is a docbook which is widely used in a book production
[12:11:06] * SvenG .oO(BRD word document?)
[12:11:31] <habamax> and asciidoc format is a lightweight version of it
[12:11:35] <igemnace> pandoc is my weapon of choice for all of those, when it's convenient to write in plain text. otherwise, i just create a doc in a word processor

[14:21:54] <talmobi> hauleth: thanks, figured out the issue was that the autocmd was defined before the plugin code -- so it was trying to call a command that didn't exist yet, I guess
[14:22:08] <talmobi> moving autocmd below the plug codeblock solved issue
[14:23:29] <talmobi> i'm guessing it has to do with filetype definitions are loaded before regex definitions etc and depending on which you use the order of definitions also matter

[19:01:43] <rsarson> hi!  i came across this: Normally 'autoindent' should also be on when using 'smartindent' (:h 'si')  why?  i can't see a difference when testing.  i found https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/18590/, which shows smartindent vs cindent, but nothing about why autoindent should be on when using smartindent
