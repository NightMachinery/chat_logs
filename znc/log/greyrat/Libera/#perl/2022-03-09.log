[18:21:23] <haarg> numbers and numeric strings are pretty much interchangeable in perl, so it's not obvious what kind of errors you are talking about

[18:21:42] <haarg> unless you are passing in something that isn't a number, in which case i'm not sure how you'd expect to convert it to a number
[18:22:46] <haarg> and it kind of sounds like the numeric check is revealing a real issue, so removing it doesn't sound right
[18:22:54] <The_Blode> What I've done is...I've made a note on this code review. I can see the original variable is initialised as $var = "";
[18:23:07] <The_Blode> Which is fine but then $var < 1, Perl is getting upset
[18:23:18] <The_Blode> So I've just changed $var = 0;
[18:23:22] <The_Blode> As it's initialisation value.
[18:23:25] <The_Blode> All fine now.
[18:23:37] <haarg> seems like the right fix
[18:23:52] <The_Blode> It was my hunch. Thanks :) the other error is funky and I have no clue really.
[18:24:12] <The_Blode> Will leave that one till last as I don't fully understand it. Still learning Perl all the time. Everyday's a school day.
[18:24:33] <The_Blode> This guy is new to Perl so trying to steer him on the right path. Probably best to initialise with nothing $var;
[18:24:41] <The_Blode> I'm guilty of initialising stuff to strings though.
[18:24:50] <The_Blode> use strict helps correct me though and guides me.
[18:25:09] <The_Blode> Also, I noticed he was doing %hash = ""; which Perl outright rejects.
[18:25:12] <The_Blode> And rightfully so.
[18:25:45] <The_Blode> I've never seen debug say code was "Useless" though lol
[18:29:50] <haarg> generally that would be something like: my $f = 5; $f; print "blah\n";
[18:30:30] <haarg> that $f is just sitting there doing nothing, so it probably indicates a programmer error
[18:33:07] <The_Blode> Yeah. He's new to Perl so yeah. These things are happening.
[18:33:27] <The_Blode> Like @array; print @array[0];
[18:33:36] <The_Blode> Perl was unhappy with that

[20:06:50] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: my risc-v board arrives today :) also i now know why the hell i haven't been able to figure out where the hell it was.  took 3 weeks to go from China->US to their logistics partner, then spend 9 days in customs, got a tracking number for USPS, but DHL picked it up with a different tracking number, and then gave it to the USPS by me today to actually deliver, which updated the USPS
[20:06:51] <veesh> this is defs OHMAGERD level
[20:06:56] <simcop2387> tracking number finally.
[20:07:24] <LeoNerd> Ahyes.. I'm waiting on a supply of more of those 32x8 LED matrix boards, so I can do my big scrolling text sign

[20:09:01] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: mqtt + esphome, you could just have it pull text and render it as a scrolling message pretty easily.  https://esphome.io/components/display/max7219digit.html as an example
[20:09:02] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ MAX7219 Digit Display — ESPHome ]
[20:09:39] <simcop2387> i plan to do that with mine once i get around to putting an FPGA in the middle for doing the actual driving.  Mine's RGB and to get a decent color gradient i need the better timing from an FPGA
[20:09:57] <LeoNerd> Ahyes - a HUB75 panel? I have some of those to play with
[20:10:02] <LeoNerd> I suspect the RP2040 can drive it
[20:10:49] <simcop2387> should be able to do it decently yes.  the PIO or whatever the 2040 calls it should make that a lot easier than trying to do funky crap with DMA, bitplanes, and interrupts like i was doing with a teensy 3.2
[20:11:10] <LeoNerd> Yeah... that PIO will do verynicely
[20:12:06] <simcop2387> i got that to mostly work, but i was basically stuck at doing anything other than simple animations because of cpu time to render since i was frequently in interrupts to send things out to the display.  an fpga + SPI to dump a buffer to should be very nice in the end.

[20:14:46] <LeoNerd> Have you read the (Adafruit?) article about doing colour gradients using PCM rather than PWM? If you do that you have tonnes more CPU time for actually working out what to display
[20:15:10] <simcop2387> i hadn't, that might be nicer for the FPGA too then

[20:17:44] <LeoNerd> Oh yeah it came from there
[20:17:57] <LeoNerd> I probably have a link soooomewhere, I'll see if I can dig it up
[20:18:31] <LeoNerd> But the basic idea is rather than doing e.g. 8bit PWM where you do 256 timer interrupts, you break the periods up unevenly and do only 8 interrupts of increasing (or decreasing) interval, and do each segment on/off the entire time corresponding to a single bitslice of your data
[20:18:47] <LeoNerd> So between the largest times, you have tonnes of spare CPU cycles to do interesting calculations

[20:27:12] <simcop2387> ah yea that's basically how i was doing those panels, the real problem was the anemic DMA buffers and needing to go back constantly to point them at the next section to send out.  and then during the shortest period i only had a few 10s microseconds to shift the data out.  at least if i wanted more than a few FPS and more than 4 bits per channel
[20:28:03] <simcop2387> i had several KB of data to push out and only something like 64bytes per dma channel and needed all the DMA channels at once to do it.  been a while since i looked though.  end result was just frustration and going "fuck this, FPGA or CPLD"

[21:51:17] <LeoNerd> It's not intended to be useful
