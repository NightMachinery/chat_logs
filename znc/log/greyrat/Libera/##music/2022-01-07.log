[23:09:56] <MusicalDillo> wow
[23:14:12] <Panther> hmmm...  his family were citizens of a British Commonwealth, but he was by chance born in Miami, so as a US citizen,  he was not entitled to be called Sir.
[23:15:39] <Panther> I don't see if he ever applied for dual citizenship, which would have conferred the substantive rights of the position. Still, it is a very high honor.
[23:18:05] <Panther> Peerages may be created by means of letters patent, but the granting of new hereditary peerages has largely dwindled; only seven hereditary peerages have been created since 1965, four of them for members of the British royal family.
