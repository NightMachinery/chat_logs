[03:00:38] <Gerula> maybe Hannah Arendt isn't the best example
[03:01:25] <Gerula> At an early stage of his polemic with Culianu, Eliade complained in writing that "it is not possible to write an objective history" of the Iron Guard and its leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu.[263] Arguing that people "would only accept apologetics [...] or executions", he contended: "After Buchenwald and Auschwitz, even honest people cannot afford being objective".

[12:54:36] <amigojapan> good mornig mrig
[12:54:40] <mrig> amigojapan: is dogmatic belief caused by indoctrination?

[12:56:12] <mrig> I've not been vaccinated, but am not anti vaccines, if you have any questions I'd be happy to answer. For me, I would say that this choice is guided by both philosophy and science.
[12:56:18] <assan> you being conspiratorial
[12:56:38] <assan> with that philosophy means love of wisdom
[12:56:50] <assan> you joking right?
[12:57:01] <mrig> amigojapan: that appears to be a strawman argument :)
[12:57:20] <mrig> why not put some petrol on it too?
[12:57:25] <assan> that's not what philosophy means when we investigate the word even further amigojapan
[12:57:25] <amigojapan> assan: that is the meaning of the greek words philo and sofy
[12:57:49] <mrig> sophia is the goddess of widome

[12:58:31] <mrig> Interestingly also in arabic, a concept very similar to that of maya in eastern philosophy.

[13:02:49] <assan> so when we talking vaccine amigojapan, different medical philosophies have how they treat ailments and some of us don't include balaclavas and vaccines
[13:03:11] <mrig> s/of/or/
[13:03:11] <ro-bot-o> mrig meant to say: these days a needle in the frontal lobe or a electrocution or drugging.
[13:04:08] <mrig> It is rather sad for these dogmatic fools that they can not see reality with any greater resolution or definition.
[13:04:45] <mrig> such is life, humanity needs all of its branches in order to explore its way forwards.
[13:05:52] <amigojapan> assan: people also say "my personal philosophy is" yeah
[13:06:20] <assan> mhmm
[13:07:06] <assan> that's why i say you should join the league of the true scholars
[13:07:12] <assan> but no
[13:07:19] <assan> you being paranoid
[13:07:26] <dispersed> there's medicine, and alternative medicine, not really multiple philosophies in medicine
[13:07:52] <assan> well it's like Christianity
[13:07:53] <dispersed> mainstream medicine has evidence based medicine and maybe some less evidence based, just clinical practice
[13:07:55] <amigojapan> dispersed: there is also being against medicine
[13:08:23] <assan> Christians would say there's God and there's gods
[13:08:44] <assan> so it's easy to claim my god is the true god
[13:08:47] <amigojapan> God is just one of the gods
[13:09:00] <dispersed> even chinese use western medicine first, and their own traditional medicine if you run out of science-based tricks
[13:09:06] <assan> yeah so medicine is just one of the medicines
[13:09:27] <dispersed> (if they can afford)
[13:09:28] <assan> let's not call one the medicine while others alternatives
[13:09:51] <amigojapan> dispersed: in Japan we have kanpo yaku, which is traditional chinese medicine that has been tested by western medical standards and riggor
[13:10:23] <dispersed> I suppose that is evidence based medicine then
[13:10:42] <dispersed> but of course people elsewhere may not know it
[13:10:46] <amigojapan> yup,  yet many foreigners dont like it cause it is based on Chinese medicine
[13:11:51] <amigojapan> dispersed: as for as I am concerened kanpo yaku is just part of western medicine now

[13:49:47] <mrig> amigojapan: He was in a sweatshop and is now building iphones as a child labourer.
[13:50:04] <mrig> sorry, was reincarnated in a sweatshop.

[13:51:27] <mrig> that's just common knowledge in non materialist cultures.
[13:51:28] <amigojapan> but it is possible he would be alive had he taken normal treatment, or even both herbal and normal

[13:55:30] <amigojapan> mrig: even tho he died early, I guess Iam still jelous of how much influence he had over the computer industry
[13:55:35] <mrig> Perhaps he had already sealed his fate, and it was far to late?
[13:55:47] <amigojapan> perhaps
[13:56:12] <mrig> Perhaps he was lacking some vital aspect of the lifestyle that is supposed to accompany that kind of approach.
[13:56:28] <mrig> There is usually a ritual aspect too.

[14:04:53] <mrig> focusing upon 'who dunn it' really is a western thing, and is completely irrelevant at the end of the day.

[22:32:16] <Irishmanluke> mutation isnt and doesnt have to be truly random though
[22:32:33] <Irishmanluke> only pseudorandom
[22:34:07] <Irishmanluke> randomness is a convenient way to model processes which are aggregates of subprocesses which are affected by a lot of small local variables that we cant possibly be expected to model by themselves
[22:36:06] <Irishmanluke> so essentially you have this large process which extremely computationaly complex on its own but there are certain processes that are emergent from it that become probalistically computationally reducible
[22:38:17] <Irishmanluke> the idea being if a process were determistically computationally reducible wed be able to produce models whose predictions all had probability values of 1, (this is different from how accurate or precise the model is)
