[00:02:02] <Robomot> Lermontov (Russian nobility) - Wikipedia (Lermontov (Russian: Лермонтовы) is the name of a Russian noble family of Scottish origin, descended from George Learmonth (who was known in Russia as Yuri Andreevich Lermont). The family legend has it that George Learmonth was a descendant of the famed 13th-century Scottish poet Thomas the Rhymer (also known as Thomas Learmonth).[1])

[00:23:18] <saturn2> catern: informative
[00:24:48] <mst> catern: 'discovery'
[00:25:23] <mst> I think maybe 'introduction' is a superset of that, but it would be worth at least discussing that fact
[00:26:11] <catern> oh yes, let me add a short bullet point about service discovery, I had one before, it's important to at least include that phrase
[00:28:49] <mst> catern: I think a key difference is discovery is 'intentionally going out and -asking- for an introduction to X' whereas things like three vat introduction are more 'at the discretion of the service you're talking to' ?
[00:30:44] <catern> yes, that's a good distinction - and in both cases you don't care what the exact "route"/address to X is, you just want some route, no matter what it is
[00:31:56] <mst> also, hrm, something like SRV records + round robin / geoip type stuff blurs the lines interestingly
[00:32:15] <mst> but "remote service tells you 'actually, talk to X using Y'" is definitely an introduction that isn't pure discovery
[00:32:28] <mst> heh, HTTP 302s are also a blurry case depending on the situation
[00:32:53] <mst> catern: sorry, just thinking out loud (the fact reading the post made me do so should be considered a +1 to the post even if my thoughts are of variably quality ;)
[00:32:57] <mst> *variable

[00:35:18] <saturn2> should you distinguish granting a capability vs just giving out a redirect?
[00:35:52] <mst> I've worked with systems that gave out a redirect with an HMAC'ed token baked into the target URL

[00:46:18] <catern> saturn2: that's a great point, I'll think about it - indeed most of these (the first few) *aren't* secure capabilities, because it's possible to just scan IP addresses and URLs and access things without being explicitly introduced; but, still, if you're introduced, and you can save the key/password/capability and reuse it again later, that doesn't necessarily make it not a capability
[00:49:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> "$x = preg_replace('/\\\\/','//////',$x);" ... statements dreamed up by the utterly deranged
[00:49:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> wait no it's
[00:49:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> $x = preg_replace('/\\\\/','\\\\\\',$x);
[00:49:54] <mst> so 'replace two backslashes with three' ?
[00:50:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> No
[00:50:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Replace one backslash with two.
[00:52:18] <mst> uh, you have four and six backslashes in there, I am confused
[00:52:32] <mst> like in perl s/\\\\/\\\\\\/ would be two -> three
[00:52:42] <mst> s/\\/\\\\/ would be one -> two
[00:52:52] <gwern> so, this is men's preg slash
[00:53:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Yes. I do indeed have four and six backslashes in there. And yet...
[00:54:35] <gwern> (the level of formatting and notation in this song paper is unreal. it took me the past hour to excerpt & format it while setting up regexps/rewrites for everything it does that my enormous list of specialcases still doesn't handle)
[00:54:48] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: I ... ok, you know what, I don't want to know
[00:56:17] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: so it's x4 on the LHS and x3 on the RHS and ... yeah, no, never mind :/
[00:57:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: The left hand side is easy enough to explain. \\ turns into \ in a single-quoted PHP string, and then the regexp engine gets \\, which of course just means \
[00:57:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: But what's going on with the right hand side?? Nobody knows, and probably it's impossible to find out
[00:58:33] <Betawolf> it's just establishing the exchange rate between forward and back-slashes
[00:59:04] <saturn2> maybe PHP helpfully unescapes strings until they reach a fixed point, for your convenience
[00:59:27] <kuudes> are there cyclical such strings?
[00:59:49] <kuudes> or could I play game of life with such a conversion thingy
[00:59:53] <saturn2> i don't think so
[01:00:26] <saturn2> the unescaped string is always shorter or the same
[01:00:47] <kuudes> could it change characters with phase 2?
[01:01:07] <gwern> there are string rewrite systems which are TC but I think you need at least one shortening operation, it can't just get longer without bound... hm, although that doesn't mean it does no computation, look at CAs or wang tiles
[01:01:21] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: oh, hang on, it's turning into '\\\' so the first one escapes the second one then the third one is taken literally
[01:01:33] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: '\\\\\\\\' (eight) would probably work just as well
[01:01:51] <mst> and possibly have less chance of summoning an elder god later
[01:02:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: But why is the third one taken literally? And why is the second one escaped??
[01:03:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh because it could be like \1 or something
[01:03:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> And be a capture group reference
[01:03:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah ok you're probably right
[01:04:35] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: nope
[01:04:48] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: because it's the last one in the string, so there's nothing left to escape
[01:04:56] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: so obviously it wasn't a typo, you just meant it literally
[01:05:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: No that was about the first+second one that I was talking about
[01:05:44] <mst> eh? \\\ is handled as '\\' -> escaped \, followed by '\' at end of string
[01:06:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> I understand, but the question was "why is it escaped at all"
[01:06:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is a replacement pattern
[01:06:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> And the answer is "because the backslash still has special meaning, due to e.g. capture group references"
[01:06:41] *** Joins: son0p (~ff@181.136.122.143)
[01:06:44] <mst> right, which is effectively a qqstring since it can have \1 or $1 in it
[01:06:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> What's a qqstring
[01:07:01] <mst> double quoted string
[01:07:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah yes
[01:07:13] <mst> except unquoted in an environment where only $1, $2 etc. are available for interpolation
[01:07:25] <mst> which is why I was thinking about that, not the (discouraged) \1 syntax
[01:07:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, anyway, I removed that bit from the code
[01:07:41] <mst> > \11, for example, would confuse preg_replace() since it does not know whether you want the \1 backreference followed by a literal 1, or the \11 backreference followed by nothing. In this case the solution is to use ${1}1. This creates an isolated $1 backreference, leaving the 1 as a literal.

It contains fungicides to inhibit mold growth, controls fruit respiration to delay ripening, protects from bruising while the fruit travels, and includes tints and glossy shellac to enhance a fruit’s appearance. ... The waxes themselves are made from sugar cane, beeswax, carnauba, and resins."

[07:16:15] * gwern wonders how long until the simpsons gets rebooted or something. it's far too valuable IP to just keep wheezing out the nth season on fox no one watches
[07:16:48] <adiabatic> have they had to retire any of the VAs yet
[07:17:07] <gwern> there was a fuss over apu. I dunno what the results were
[07:17:24] <gwern> but of course, a reboot is also a perfect time to reboot the VA salaries^WVAs
[07:17:29] <adiabatic> he's out, but I'm wondering about the woman who voices Bart Simpson, among others
[07:17:34] <feep> gwern: I mean, do they understand that if they can't make season 59 or whatever good, they also cannot make the reboot good
[07:17:48] <gwern> feep: you'd be handing it over to a new team, of course
[07:18:03] <adiabatic> isn't the team a ship of theseus at this point
[07:18:06] <gwern> feep: like, _cowboy bebop_. it's not the original animators sitting on the set directing the actors
[07:18:25] <feep> .. was that remade...?
[07:18:27] <gwern> new series, new team, new vision
[07:19:01] <adiabatic> feep: Netflix is making a live-action one. John Cho got hurt and they entirely paused everything waiting for him to recover instead of ditching him and going with another Spike
[07:19:15] <gwern> no guarantee of success, but at least it'll be different. you can say a lot of things about the star wars reboot but "it was shitty in the way george lucas would've made it shitty" is not one of them (it discovered its own ways)
[07:19:28] <gwern> yeah, I think the netflix one drops in a few days
[07:19:33] <feep> adiabatic: uh    okay
[07:19:35] <adiabatic> That soon?
[07:19:41] <gwern> yes, like the 19th or something
[07:19:46] <adiabatic> well shit
[07:19:53] <gwern> the previews all look *super* close to the original, which is its own failure mode
[07:20:09] <feep> yeah that's ... more than a *lot* of shows, cowboy bebop is a specific mood
[07:20:36] <adiabatic> hmmmm, Netflix's My List doesn't show expiration dates anymore

[19:44:44] <gwern> (amphetamines don't boost your IQ at all, only your motivation and willingness to apply the IQ you have already. they can boost your performance on IQ tests and you get a higher score, but because you solve more easy stuff and not on the hardest questions)

[19:49:41] <Gurkenglas> when we give people anti-amphetamines before the test, does that remove the variance in the motivation component?
[19:49:53] <gwern> and another way to put it would be in terms of _r_, that means that increasing the x factor by 1SD increases the iq score by 0.1SD. that's a lot

[19:55:32] <shawwwn> ^
[19:56:06] <Gurkenglas> uhhh guys just take the gradient of the total logprobability of the completion with respect to the scaling of the embedded tokens from that line
[19:56:44] <PapuaHardyNet> what is "scaling of the embedded tokens from that line"
[19:57:27] <PapuaHardyNet> are you saying you look at the contextual embeddings of the encoder and decoder and then use that to interpret what caused the alternate completion to be suggested?
[19:57:37] <PapuaHardyNet> sounds sensible, but I have no idea what that means in practice
[19:57:56] <Gurkenglas> embed the 10 tokens from that line, literally multiply every entry of the 10 vectors by a, take the derivative at a=1. (or did that not do "pay more attention to these", i dont remember)

[20:00:03] <PapuaHardyNet> s/to/too/
[20:00:04] <RiversHaveWings> Gurkenglas: why would that work, smaller and bigger embeddings than the actual embeddings aren't in-distribution for the model
[20:00:54] <Gurkenglas> the hope is that the architecture is constructed to make this sensible, let me think whether this can be done while staying in-distribution.
[20:00:56] <gwern> attention maps and interpretability is a huge field but one with questionable results
[20:02:06] <gwern> I am not entirely sure you can say what 'made it pick one completion over another', because after all, the answer is just 'the RNG spat out 0.13, which made me pick token #7 instead of token #1 at the 3rd BPE'
[20:02:59] <gwern> there's not really any 'reason' when it comes to top-k/top-p sampling
[20:03:17] <Gurkenglas> gwern, i mean what made this completion so probable. although i suppose it might be an issue that it'll tell me about features of the completion orthogonal to the one i was curious about
[20:03:25] <shawwwn> ggreer: https://i.redd.it/ftezmx1i75081.jpg
[20:04:21] <RiversHaveWings> Gurkenglas: what if you took the magnitude of the gradient for an embedding and divided it by the magnitude of the embedding
[20:04:39] <Gurkenglas> suppose there's a completion i'd accept and one i'd reject and they subjectively "differ along two dimensions", of which I'm only curious about one. then i'd want it to generate completions "between" the two for binary search
[20:05:42] <gwern> GPT-3 doesn't by default have any real text embedding that you could treat as a disentangled latent representation
[20:05:46] <Gurkenglas> RiversHaveWings, why the denominator? do you expect gradients to all else equal be bigger the bigger the vector?
[20:06:00] <RiversHaveWings> Gurkenglas: to correct for the embeddings being different magnitudes
[20:06:03] <RiversHaveWings> yes
[20:06:19] <gwern> you can totally say, 'StyleGAN, show me the difference between these two faces along a human-interpretable axis like "glasses", and interpolate' because it has a _z_ where 'glasses' is a single specific number
[20:06:38] <gwern> 'text interpolation' is a lot harder and rarer
[20:06:42] <RiversHaveWings> and if it's not a specific number it's something simple like linear direction
[20:06:48] <RiversHaveWings> a linear direction
[20:06:49] <gwern> 'code interpolation', being text, is the same thing
[20:07:02] <Gurkenglas> gwern, yes the "between" would be done by "find a completion whose line-wise attribution strengths are between the two given completion's"

[20:07:57] <RiversHaveWings> Gurkenglas: you can have different completions with similar attribution strengths though right?
[20:08:13] <Gurkenglas> RiversHaveWings, that would say how much the completion's probability would change if that line were who-knows-what, not if it were deleted
[20:08:25] <PapuaHardyNet> so a model needs to have both encoders and decoders for interpretability to be possible?
[20:08:51] <gwern> no... iGPT shows that you *can* extract embeddings out of GPT. it's just very unusual and hard and a research project

[20:18:26] <Gurkenglas> the line could perhaps be replaced with a call to a function that presumably is implemented at the end of the file. though always naming it foo would cause inconvenient associations in gpt...
[20:20:38] <Gurkenglas> but all of that is much more expensive and complicated than RiversHaveWings' suggestion, which is worth trying, maybe it just works. along with the one where we take the "away-from-zero" direction of the gradient instead of the norm over all directions.

[20:26:21] <Gurkenglas> the reason i suspect away-from-zero might just work is that scaling an embedded vector that way merely increases the extent to which the attention's softmax selects everything involving those tokens.
[20:27:34] <Gurkenglas> of course if the attention was already sure that line is the relevant one, the gradient will be very small, so by rights one needs to do an integrated-gradients calculation.

[20:51:59] <Gurkenglas> what would you recommend? something someone has previously interpreted, ideally, for a benchmark.
[20:52:20] <gwern> I'd start with paperswithcode and go from there, I guess, if I wanted a smol classifier

[20:55:15] <gwern> then FixEfficientNet-B1 at 7.2M, ViTAE-6M at 6.5M, MixNet-M at 5M and so on
[20:56:11] <Gurkenglas> those are professional numbers. im looking for rookie numbers.
[20:56:23] <gwern> well then keep scrolling down?
[20:56:42] <gwern> I think all of those outperform whatever old inception you're using while being a fifth or less the size
[20:58:05] <Gurkenglas> it doesnt have to perform well. it doesnt have to do what these do. it can be 0.00003M.

Habitual washers fatigue 43% less than people who wash more consciously, but respond just as much to habit disruptions. Consistent with location-specific cue-based habit formation, healthcare
[21:12:40] <feepbot> workers are more likely to wash in rooms they have visited more often in the past.

[23:03:05] <ggreer> they're arguing over this video. apparently the defense's copy is 4MB. the prosecution's copy is over twice as big. the prosecution emailed the video to the defense and apparently that compressed the video (losing significant quality & resolution)
[23:03:28] <adiabatic> 480p vs. 1080p
[23:04:06] <dv^_^> In the Rittenhouse trial?
[23:04:08] <ggreer> yeah
[23:04:12] <ggreer> jury is still deliberating
[23:04:29] <adiabatic> who's doing the arguing?
[23:04:52] <ggreer> not clear. the livestream just cut in with the judge talking
[23:05:11] <ggreer> I'm guessing the defense made some motion
[23:05:13] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : https://archive.md/eDczg
[23:05:14] <two2thehead> "Professor Cited as Corruption Expert Is Sentenced for Money Laundering A former University of Miami international studies professor used bank accounts in his name and the name of a company he created to launder about $2.5 million, prosecutors said."

[23:05:36] <adiabatic> ggreer: yeah, I saw the motion to dismiss with prejudice last night
[23:05:38] <feep> he just did it for the cred
[23:06:10] <two2thehead> feep, street cred is VERY IMPORTANT in the forensic accounting field :V
[23:06:46] <feep> damn it feels good to have tenure
[23:07:56] <gwern> two2thehead: didn't realize he hadn't been sentenced yet. not surprised he got so little time: the ruin of his name and career and the costs of defense alone are pretty good punishment
[23:08:41] <two2thehead> gwern, this is just like _The Wire_. Only a lot more dorkier
[23:09:09] <two2thehead> "According to prosecutors, Dr. Bagley opened a bank account in Florida under his company’s name, Bagley Consultants, in 2016. But there was hardly any activity in the account until a year later, when he started receiving large deposits from bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates and in Switzerland.
[23:09:10] <two2thehead> Those accounts ostensibly belonged to a food company and a wealth management firm but were actually controlled by a Colombian national whose money came from “the proceeds of foreign bribery and embezzlement stolen from the Venezuelan people,” according to an indictment."
[23:09:47] <kuudes> ah, he took bribes from the *wrong* people
[23:09:54] <PapuaHardyNet> cool! man stepped into the big leagues for a while
[23:09:55] <two2thehead> The full gamut, UAE Switzerland Colombia and Venezuela
[23:10:08] <kuudes> he would have got away with it unless it was for you pesky cia and nsa
[23:10:10] <adiabatic> nobody's allowed to steal from the venezuelan people except venezuelan politicians
[23:10:42] <kuudes> adiabatic, I presume he took money from venezuelan politicians and us intelligence outed him
[23:10:53] <two2thehead> could be possible
[23:15:53] <feepbot> <gwern> 'The vulnerability—present in Pentium, Celeron, and Atom CPUs on the Apollo Lake, Gemini Lake, and Gemini Lake Refresh platforms—allows skilled hackers with possession of an affected chip to run it in debug and testing modes used by firmware developers. Intel and other chipmakers go to great lengths to prevent such access by unauthorized people. Once in developer mode,
[23:15:54] <feepbot> an attacker can extract the key used to encrypt data stored in the TPM enclave and, in the event TPM is being used to store a Bitlocker key, defeat the latter protection as well.

[23:35:31] <PapuaHardyNet> chromium has this amazing feature of timestamped history
[23:35:46] <PapuaHardyNet> firefox really should have it too
[23:36:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... it does?
[23:36:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> They both have this feature
[23:37:13] <gwern> 'timestamped'?
[23:37:30] <ggreer> they use VLC <3
[23:37:37] <ggreer> "VLC? It's all greek to me." -Judge
[23:38:03] <PapuaHardyNet> well, they aren't timestamped, or if they are, you aren't shown the timestamps. however, firefox does give the option to sort by last visited, which is... not great but acceptable

[23:38:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Huh? I'm not seeing anything different in Chromium than in Firefox
[23:38:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Screenshot this feature, let's see it
[23:38:46] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern: by timestamped I mean a specific datetime should be associated with the history entry
[23:38:52] *** Joins: gareppa (~gareppa@user/gareppa)
[23:38:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, Firefox has this

[23:40:48] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: view literally says "by date"
[23:40:53] <feep> if you open the real history view, you get timestamps
[23:41:07] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, I was supposed to open the "real history view", a separate window entirely
[23:41:17] <feep> wait shit no you don't still
[23:41:19] <feep> wtf
[23:41:26] <feep> oh, you do, you can turn it on
[23:41:30] <PapuaHardyNet> the sidebar is what I always considered the history view smh
[23:41:32] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: yeah, ctrl-shift-h
[23:41:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is what happens when you use bad operating systems

[23:42:28] <PapuaHardyNet> right, ctrl+shift+h does open it. Why is it not mapped to ctrl+h jesus
[23:42:41] <gwern> 'Most Recent Vist' is the column you want I guess
[23:42:46] <PapuaHardyNet> yep
[23:45:55] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: firefox still has a menu bar
[23:46:21] <feep> it's just hidden by default, you press alt to access it
[23:46:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: I say *proper* menu bars
[23:46:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or rather, *a* proper menu bar
