[00:13:47] <Panther> It was on salw for $8/g, so that's not too bad these days.
[00:14:55] <piercedwater> nice. i tried CBD and it was meh...250mg 30mL bottle for $25
[00:15:47] <piercedwater> mint flavored which was nice
[00:16:40] <Panther> Usually with what I can get here, I wind up using about 50mg of CBD per day.
[00:16:53] <piercedwater> what strength?
[00:17:03] <Panther> 23%
[00:17:07] <piercedwater> oh hmm
[00:17:22] <Panther> It also has 0.9% d-9 in it :)
[00:17:39] <Panther> But that doesn't amount to much.
[00:18:46] <piercedwater> i kind of want to try whiskey again
[00:19:05] <piercedwater> have a nice drink before music listening, i think it might improve my enjoyment of music

[22:13:19] <independent56> I have decided for CC BY-SA 4.0 to allow remixing, but thats only because i'mscared someone might stealmy rights when it's in the public domain.
[22:13:31] <artao> i mean ... if that's what you want to do, yeah
[22:13:53] <artao> i don't know about "adviseable"
[22:14:26] <independent56> I am a programmer, so a lot of what i wrote was released into the open source domain. Is the public domain for msuic similar to open source?
[22:15:21] <sublim20> whats your goal
[22:15:24] <artao> i dunno. i guess
[22:15:29] <TomatoSynth> if its in the public domain, do you have 'rights'?
[22:15:34] <artao> tho moreso people work with audio, not data
[22:16:01] <artao> not sure what you mean by "composition" .. the MIDI files? the project files?

[23:21:47] <murthy> macrobat: how is that finger thing holding on to her fingers when she is plucking?
[23:21:53] <murthy> do they glue it?
[23:21:55] <macrobat> ah, I meant the sheng
[23:22:14] <murthy> oh ok
[23:22:50] <murthy> that sheng looks like a some kind of bagpipe without the bag
[23:24:17] <macrobat> sitar pick is like a metal thread cage put on one finger. guzheng picks are strapped to the fingers
[23:25:33] <artao> murthy wow. i've never seen such a thing
[23:25:56] <artao> as an office worker tho we'd sometimes wear rubber fingertips for shuffling paper
[23:26:03] <murthy> macrobat: oh ok
[23:26:06] <artao> we called em finger condoms LOL
[23:26:12] <artao> MUCH tinier tho. just the tip
[23:26:14] <artao> heh heh
[23:26:16] <murthy> those straps seems to be not visible
[23:26:33] <artao> i preferred using the little jar of waxy stuff. just rub your finger on it
[23:26:41] <artao> the rubber finger tips you can't really feel anything
[23:27:16] <murthy> artao: you think that finger condones would work with your bass?
[23:27:42] <artao> no
[23:27:42] <murthy> ok sorry I forgot
[23:27:47] <artao> they'd get torn apart
[23:27:56] <artao> your finger tips develop nice callouses over time
[23:28:04] <murthy> your situation is authoroties
[23:28:07] <artao> right
[23:29:20] <murthy> artao: thats why vegan
[23:29:53] <artao> that has nothing to do with arthritis
[23:29:58] <artao> in my case it's genetic
[23:29:59] <murthy> yes
[23:30:03] <murthy> no
[23:30:21] <artao> mom had both hips and both knees replaced, dad had a hip replaced, two brothrs have had their knees replaced ...
[23:30:26] <murthy> arthritis is because of excess uric acid in blood
[23:30:30] <artao> joint problems in general actually
[23:30:44] <murthy> ok
[23:30:53] <artao> i also have elhers danlos syndrome, but not NEARLY as bad as my sister
[23:31:12] <murthy> sorry about your sister
[23:31:20] <artao> yeah. thx
[23:31:39] <artao> another sister has rheumatoid arthritis. i just have osteoarthritis
[23:31:43] <artao> she's an RN
[23:32:01] <morf> :|
[23:32:10] <murthy> artao: Its not anyone's fault
[23:32:12] <murthy> artao: but
[23:32:12] <artao> she also has celiac disease, as does another brother
[23:32:26] <murthy> artao: the medical community and lack of research
[23:32:45] <murthy> all humans deserve life without re precautions
[23:32:46] <morf> but we need to hear all about it
