[06:00:04] <mocx> I recently was reviewing setting up Hibernate on my laptop running Manjaro and I was surprised to find how easy it was. I also think there are a lot of conflicting advice on Linux when it comes to enabling stuff like this.
[06:01:00] <mocx> Most people just talk about battery drain but I’m finding systemctl + plasma settings sufficient for dramatically increasing my battery life.

With Perl, the project might fail because you designed and implemented a pile of shit, but there is a clever workaround for any problem, so you might be able to keep it going long enough to hand it off to someone else, and then when it fails it will be their fault, not yours.

[17:48:34] <q3k> perhaps considering the thing in terms of 'fans' and 'love' is the problem here

[18:04:00] <iDrougge> I don't like working with Rust very much because you must write unwrap() after every statement.
[18:09:34] <companion_cube> You really shouldn't have to
[18:09:43] <companion_cube> That's a red flag
[18:10:01] <companion_cube> (some are legit, like unwrap on a lock guard, though)
[18:10:06] <iDrougge> And they say it is the most stable language, but it crashes all the time!

[18:11:26] <companion_cube> Ah well, if you work on rust written by bad programmers, sure
[18:12:20] <iDrougge> That's my point. People who enjoy working in $LANGUAGE might not enjoy it just as much if they had to share it with your average programmer.
[18:12:39] <companion_cube> Quite possible
[18:12:53] <companion_cube> But think that some people have to work with mediocre C++
[18:13:01] <companion_cube> Now that's a scary thought
[18:13:19] <iDrougge> Some even have to work on the compiler.

[20:34:53] <epilys> JordiGH, one of my freelance clients is a VPS provider and uses redis so there's that one single data point
[20:40:01] <arnt> Redis is just so widely used that it's no longer particularly cool. Not passé.
[20:42:49] <q3k> i've always seen redis as passe, generally used as a workaround for languages that make it difficult to keep state between requests
[20:43:30] <q3k> doesn
[20:43:33] <q3k> bleh.
[20:44:01] <q3k> doesn't offer any significant durability or consistency guarantees, you're expected to be bale to always regenerate your redis data from somewhere else...
[20:44:10] <q3k> so just keep a local cache and skip the network stack roundtrip
[20:44:27] <technomancy> we use it for caches that specifically need to be shared across multiple machines
[20:44:34] <technomancy> obviously for a single machine it's silly
[20:45:20] <q3k> an alternative for these usecases is to move whatever logic needs the cache into a deeper serving tier as it's own little process, and keep the cache local in process still
[20:45:25] <arnt> Redis is great for the kind of app runs on a rack, and in my impression that's what it's designed for. The ability to use it on a single machine is just an accidental side effect.
[20:46:15] <arnt> You can always move stuff around. RFC 1925 point 6.

[20:50:52] <q3k> in the same way writing any web service is inventing your own postgres, as you could've implemented your entire thing in pl/sql
[20:51:01] <technomancy> ah never mind; misread. you're recommending a single point of failure instead lol.
[20:51:04] <technomancy> no thanks =)
[20:51:43] <q3k> it's not what i'm recommending, and redis is generally an SPOF anyway
[20:53:13] <q3k> cluster redis is a mess, strong consistency is not something you can achieve without sacrificing performance down to the performance of a mediocre database
[20:53:48] <technomancy> yeeeah I don't think anyone's recommending using redis in a case where strong consistency is needed
[20:53:53] <arnt> I had something fall over because of that. While I was on the train going from the office to vacation. The lack of Redis led to very high load on the backend, which broke things completely. That's a general effect of caches failing.

[20:55:27] <arnt> Possible. But doing it with redis involved twenty-some lines of code plus the tests. Difficult to beat.

[20:56:53] <q3k> coding for the happy path is easy, when you start to code for anything else it turns out that redis-like setups are super difficult to reason about
[20:57:54] <arnt> Well, the setup that my redis code replaced was what you had in mind, and broke regularly, even predictably.
[20:58:10] <q3k> ah, i see
[20:58:15] <arnt> Crontabs around the world hit the service, and the service more or less went down.
[20:58:29] <q3k> yeah, thundering herd be like that :)
[20:58:47] <q3k> not fully discrediting redis anyway, at least that wasn't my point
[20:59:00] *** Quits: gabriele (~gabriele@user/gabriele) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:00:35] <q3k> if anything my recommendation is to think about the problem at hand deeply, and not immediately default to redis any time you think you have a cache or lock problem
[21:01:37] <q3k> as another example to solve an imaginary 'global cache' problem: proper traffic steering to keep different shards/bits of a large keyspace onto more-or-less the same machines can alleviate the need for a global cache
[21:02:09] <q3k> since every server will then end up only caring about a subset of some global keyspace, and you've thus gotten rid of the need to share cache between processes
[21:04:34] <technomancy> yeah I would not be at all surprised if it gets used for a bunch of things it's not that good at

[23:48:45] <pushcx> (this is an unusually nice marketing page)
[23:49:15] <c355E3B> pushcx: I think the only thing we would do is need to hard cut over to Postgres
[23:49:37] <c355E3B> which isn't that bad last time I looked, the `L` color changing will need a rework and SearchController needs to go.
[23:49:50] <pushcx> Yeah. They can host mysql but I'd rather not run any VPSs.
[23:49:52] <c355E3B> If we are looking at neat IaaS platforms, https://railway.app/
[23:49:53] <mockturtle> [ Railway ] - railway.app
[23:50:46] <c355E3B> And they offer mysql
[23:50:50] <c355E3B> no clue if its MariaDB though
[23:50:52] <pushcx> hmmmmmm
[23:51:00] <c355E3B> (Which, we kinda need to keep the replies working)
[23:51:35] <pushcx> Yeah. Oh, speaking of, that's still darn expensive - I stuck Rails.cache(2.minutes) around that call in the PR for issue 580, the nav redesign.

[23:53:06] <c355E3B> Why not we move it to be entirely in memory?
[23:53:12] <c355E3B> Doesn't super matter if we loose it

[23:55:17] <pushcx> That'd be a per-worker cache and sessions don't pin to a worker so the user would see random stale data as they loaded new pages.
