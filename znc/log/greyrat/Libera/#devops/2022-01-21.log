[00:44:20] <slaughter> It's not necessarily wasteful, depends on the org. My wife's company has their computers literally destroyed when they're done, which makes me want to cry. Other companies sell them back (which then get refurb'd) or liquidate them or donate them to schools etc.

[03:04:54] <rawtaz> if resources that wouldnt have to be used are used, thats pretty much wasteful IMO
[03:05:16] <rawtaz> and theres no way around resources being used here
[03:08:22] <kwilczynski> ?
[03:08:36] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Resources? Gold coins?
[03:08:36] <kwilczynski> ;]
[03:16:57] <rawtaz> environmental resources, as well as monetary and human resources, as well as time.
[03:17:26] <rawtaz> you cant do work without spending resources, it's simply physics :)

[04:16:09] <rawtaz> i think daddy will have to buy one of those to test it out to make sure it's safe..
[04:16:25] * kwilczynski throws a tantrum!
[04:16:43] <rawtaz> dude life really sucks. why do all the kids get all the fun stuff, and here we grown ups (me) only get to work and stuff
[04:18:18] <rawtaz> its so unfair
[04:18:34] <kwilczynski> :/
[04:18:44] <kwilczynski> Go play on PS5.
[04:18:54] <rawtaz> im too broke to have one
[04:18:57] <kwilczynski> Stay away from my Lego and space walker!
[04:18:58] <rawtaz> i also dont have a TV
[04:19:05] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Then move in with slaughter.
[04:19:11] <rawtaz> he has a tellie?
[04:19:13] <rawtaz> i might, then.
[04:19:24] <kwilczynski> He just got a decent gig.
[04:19:27] <kwilczynski> :)
[04:19:35] <rawtaz> yea he could support me for the rest of that gig at least
[04:19:49] <rawtaz> sometimes you think the right thoughts kwilczynski
[04:19:54] <rawtaz> it's rare, but it happens!
[04:20:01] <rawtaz> we should celebrate that some day
[04:20:20] <kwilczynski> I do have a stroke of genius now and then.
[04:20:25] <kwilczynski> :)
[04:20:35] <kwilczynski> At least three time a week, I'd say.
[04:20:49] <kwilczynski> times*
[04:20:52] <rawtaz> heh
[04:21:50] <kwilczynski> ?
[04:21:54] <kwilczynski> Don't believe me?
[04:21:57] <rawtaz> heh
[04:23:34] * kwilczynski throws another tantrum!
