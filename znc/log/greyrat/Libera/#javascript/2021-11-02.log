[00:02:30] <hassoon> zettabyte: i know where to learn react from, but i'm telling another fact
[00:02:53] <lantech19446> I don't get this I did npm install jquery it said it loaded the new one but i'm still stuck on version 1.9.0
[00:02:54] <qswz> you should be grateful she did

[00:03:08] <ljharb> lantech19446: you have to specify a version if you want something out of range
[00:03:14] <ljharb> lantech19446: `npm install --save jquery@latest`, for example
[00:03:24] <hassoon> qswz: grateful she sent me a react test instead of angular/vanilla js ? and why ??
[00:03:38] <lantech19446> so jquery@1.11.0
[00:03:39] <ljharb> ew, angukar
[00:03:41] <ljharb> *angular
[00:03:52] <ljharb> lantech19446: oh well if you want 1.11 then `npm install --save jquery@1`
[00:03:54] <qswz> lantech19446: it's wrapped or downloaded from another thord-party robly
[00:03:56] <ljharb> but jquery 1 is very obsolete
[00:04:07] <hassoon> 1? old days
[00:04:16] <lantech19446> should i go to 2.0 then?
[00:04:27] <lantech19446> I know i need to be at 3 eventually but it says to do it in steps
[00:04:33] <qswz> jquery@anything is old days
[00:04:43] <hassoon> lantech19446: don't use jquery, use vanilla javascript
[00:05:18] <lantech19446> hassoon: as far as i know we're no longer using jquery but I'm still getting docked for having 1.9.0 installed
[00:05:40] <lantech19446> once i can determine that we're definitely not using it anymore i'll remove it all
[00:06:14] <zettabyte> hassoon: you're welcome :)
[00:06:15] <lantech19446> i just tried jquery@latest and it says up to date
[00:06:24] <lantech19446> so I don't understand why it's not being used
[00:07:02] <qswz> you need to understand how npm is linked to your built websites
[00:07:04] <rustyshackleford> I'm trying to figure out what's going on here
[00:07:24] <rustyshackleford> I'm using utils.inspect with breakLength:Infinity, compact: true
[00:07:41] <lantech19446> qswz: what do you mean how it's linked
[00:07:46] <rustyshackleford> in unit tests, it does what I expect which is to pretty print my object, without newlines
[00:07:52] <ljharb> lantech19446: you should be on react, and not jquery :-)
[00:07:57] <ljharb> lantech19446: but yes, do it in steps
[00:08:07] <rustyshackleford> on the client (react native), it adds newlines in between each property
[00:08:18] <silly> i'm about to apply for an angular job... hassoon want to change with me?
[00:08:25] <lantech19446> ljharb: from the way it seems it was only being used for an email script and qswz rewrote it for me in vanilla js
[00:08:37] *** Joins: AnselmoCampanas (~AnselmoCa@190.99.69.41)
[00:08:37] <rustyshackleford> is there an alternative to utils.inspect thats not JSON.stringify?
[00:08:49] <ljharb> ok
[00:08:53] <ljharb> silly: ew, why
[00:09:07] <ljharb> rustyshackleford: https://npmjs.com/object-inspect
[00:09:17] <ljharb> rustyshackleford: it's what jellobot uses
[00:09:25] <stenno\OK> silly: whats the product?
[00:09:53] <qswz> silly: oh don't, think twice
[00:10:07] <qswz> or do, it's good to burn oneself
[00:10:20] <systemfault> For some people, it's either Angular.... or unemployment.
[00:10:27] <systemfault> Depends where you live.
[00:10:30] <qswz> I did an angular job too, for a few moths
[00:10:49] <qswz> moths* and kept asking to switch to react after 3 months
[00:10:50] <ljharb> it's covid. jobs are remote.
[00:10:52] <rustyshackleford> json.stringify would work if it didn't blow up for circular objects
[00:11:00] <ljharb> if you live on the internet, there's non-angular jobs
[00:11:00] <systemfault> I'm glad that React is popular in North America
[00:11:09] <rustyshackleford> I do wonder why tf a circular object would even exist
[00:11:14] <ljharb> rustyshackleford: object-inspect should handle that, but also why would you have circular objects at all
[00:11:19] <lantech19446> qswz: I just searched everything that touches that page and none of them have any mention of jquery with the exception of that script you rewrote
[00:11:29] <rustyshackleford> ljharb: logging errors that I'm getting from an SDK
[00:11:38] <rustyshackleford> maybe I can just filter out the properties that are causing issues
[00:11:44] <rustyshackleford> I only need to log a few things
[00:11:49] <ljharb> systemfault: which countries that aren't china/vue have angular as the primary job kind?
[00:11:57] <qswz> lantech19446: share the websit eurl maybe
[00:12:05] <lantech19446> lansdalelibrary.org
[00:12:07] <qswz> because else it's never going to make progress
[00:12:48] <samsch> ljharb, Express req + res can end up being circular. Or maybe even always are?
[00:13:07] <silly> oh man :(
[00:13:12] <samsch> Or maybe I was *really* off the rails when I was writing that
[00:13:26] <qswz> lantech19446: so open devtools

[00:19:43] <qswz> lantech19446: is the subscribe form working?
[00:19:52] <lantech19446> yes

[05:27:37] <kalen> ljharb, i see you're the maintainer of the airbnb eslint config. is there any way to get it to work with eslint v8 at this point for nodejs? perhaps a beta version? i see the open issue for eslint v8 support with a few pull requests adding some features on your checklist, but i don't know if any of that makes it ready for at least partial use. i don't need for this to be production ready... just ready "enough" for a simple, personal node project
[05:30:00] <kalen> so far, i think i mainly just need eslint v8 support for top-level await (annoying having to wrap those in IIFEs with no way to just ignore the error without plugins)

[09:41:58] <kalen> eslint is insisting that i use array destructuring for setting a property on an object. for instance, const o = {}; [,,o.prop] = arr; to set the value of o.prop to the 3rd element of arr. that might be okay for a looking a few indexes deep, but what if the array has a hundred elements and i want to set it to the 99th element. it's not seriously suggesting that i do [,,,,,,,,,,,o.prop] = arr; ? or is there a better way to destructure an array

[09:49:28] <systemfault> If you don't reassign a variable, you should be using const.
[09:49:46] <ljharb> kalen: "airbnb" is not the linter config. it's the guide. the linter config is just a partial tool for enforcing the guide.
[09:49:58] <ljharb> kalen: the airbnb GUIDE, the actual thing that matters, says to avoid mutation and reassignment
[09:50:22] <kalen> yeah but you're not saying avoid. you're saying never use
[09:50:23] <kalen> heh
[09:50:25] <ljharb> kalen: "the linter allows it" doesn't matter, that just means it's not automatically prevented. "the guide allows it" is the time you can use it.
[09:50:32] <ljharb> kalen: i'm personally saying that, yes
[09:50:38] <ljharb> kalen: because i only maintain the airbnb guide, it's not MY guide.
[09:50:54] <ljharb> my personal opinions are stronger than airbnb is willing to enforce internally.
[09:50:57] <kalen> do you have a guide of your own somewhere? i'd love to read it

[09:52:05] <ljharb> absolutes are nice because when you know enough to understand when those absolutes break down, then that's the first moment you might be able to deviate from the absolute

[09:53:41] <kalen> hard and fast rules are nice. eases cognitive overload. but sometimes when you're bending over backward to accommodate a hard and fast rule, you end up wasting even more time for very little benefit

[09:54:51] <kalen> case in point, the destructuring rule caused me to refactor code into something that looks WAY uglier and longer
[09:55:11] <kalen> i like destructuring most of the time, but sometimes it's not the most concise/prettiest

[09:55:45] <ljharb> that's also the beauty of good eslint rules :-) it makes gross things uglier so they stand out more.
[09:56:07] <kalen> i'm not referring to the array thing, heh. that was just a little example i was playing around with to see the kinds of things airbnb flags

[09:56:52] <kalen> i thought maybe i was overlooking an easy way to destructure such an array without using a gazillion leading commas
[09:56:56] <ljharb> nope
[09:57:01] <ljharb> well, `.slice(99)` :-p
[09:57:02] <ljharb> but yeah
[09:57:10] <ljharb> but there's always the chance i'd loosen the airbnb config if you showed a compelling pattern
[09:57:21] <ljharb> it's happened like 3 times in the last 6 years, so there's a chance
[09:57:27] <kalen> haha
[09:57:50] <kalen> yes, i can tell you're very flexible and open-minded... not very opinionated at all xD
[09:58:16] <systemfault> The airbnb-base preset is pretty good, I personally only disable the for/of rule when writing nodejs code.
[09:58:37] <systemfault> Because using for await/of is with node streams is nicer than the alternatives.

[09:58:44] <ljharb> systemfault: yeah that's reasonable
[09:59:08] <ljharb> systemfault: if there was a separate airbnb package for "node-only code" then it would allow for-await..of, since there's no non-shitty alternative for async iteration

[10:01:54] <ljharb> kalen: but also, you just don't need that stuff in the browser most of the time
[10:02:23] <ljharb> and also, when you ship to the browser everyone, by necessity, has a broader support matrix than they would with server-only, since on the server you control the env
[10:02:35] <systemfault> kalen: If you're asking about for/of... It's because that for browsers, you usually want to support older ones... that may not support generators and/oir for of. Babel can polyfill those but the emulation is _really_ slow.
[10:03:47] <ljharb> but also, loops are terrible
[10:03:57] <ljharb> it's just that for-await-of, in particular, has no non-loop alternative yet
[10:04:17] <ljharb> and for-of when you're doing async things is slightly more readable than the .reduce alternative

[10:06:02] <sheetjs> https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v0.12/configure#L483
[10:06:13] <sheetjs> in gcc 8 `-dumpversion` returns just the major version
[10:06:18] <ljharb> `$CC` can be overridden tho
[10:06:23] <sheetjs> the correct parameter apperas to be `-dumpfullversion`
[10:06:26] <ljharb> oh, hm
[10:06:29] <ljharb> "correct"?
[10:06:36] <ljharb> or, does it depend on which gcc version is being used
[10:06:50] <sheetjs> gcc 6 -dumpversion prints the semver
[10:06:57] <ljharb> because one option is to inject `$CC` such that it listens for `-dumpversion` and changes it to `-dumpversion`
[10:07:04] <ljharb> *dumpfull
[10:07:23] <sheetjs> yeah if it is not set
[10:07:35] <sheetjs> wouldn't want to break cases where users override CC manually
[10:07:56] <ljharb> sheetjs: right nvm could detect that, and call into whatever CC is set to
[10:08:07] <ljharb> the way nvm_download changes curl params to wget params as needed
[10:08:11] <kalen> is array.fromAsync() the equivalent of Promise.all(array.map(async...));

[13:40:40] <Deneb> in JavaScript how can I determine when a file save has completed? I have the following function: https://dpaste.com/ES2XSLQXZ
[13:41:14] <Deneb> the problem is that the function finishing does not mean that the file save as completed which runs into problems when trying to save multiple files....
[13:41:28] <hassoon> Deneb: depends on the server response
[13:41:28] <sickdyd> !nomongo
[13:41:28] <jellobot> sickdyd, Don't use MongoDB - it has many issues, and is essentially never the right solution to your problem. Here's a list of issues: http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2015/07/19/why-you-should-never-ever-ever-use-mongodb/ and a more technical article at http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/
[13:41:55] <Deneb> hassoon: should have mentioned this is browser only
[13:42:09] <Deneb> hassoon: there are no calls to a server
[13:42:18] <hassoon> Deneb: how is the scenario of the file saving action like ? the user just clicks on a button pointing on a mere link for the direct file url ?
[13:42:18] <theskillwithin> sickdyd ???
[13:43:44] <Deneb> hassoon: yes, the user selects from a dropdown either one or multiple files and clicks a button. Works fine for one file, but if the user clicks multiple it only does the first few and then drops out.
[13:44:58] <Deneb> when the user selects multiple, a loop is called that reads the file details from and index and calls the pasted export function to save it
[13:45:15] <Deneb> the files are generated from data in web storage

[13:47:25] <Deneb> hassoon: I will look into it. No idea what AJAX is or what its for. Do I have to download and install it or is it already part of the browser?
[13:48:53] <hassoon> Deneb: ajax is querying url via the http protocol and doing a specific logic with the response
[13:49:45] <hassoon> Deneb: in your case, it's simply querying the file url, in other words retrieving the file via its url using a GET http request.
[13:50:30] <hassoon> Deneb: any dynamic progress monitoring operation that you want to implement does imply workign with xmlHttpRequest
[13:50:43] <hassoon> or maybe fetchApi if your more comfortable with tha

I expect that revoke is doing the same as object.remove() ? Someone suggested using promises a little while back, but even there you need some condition to determine the resolve state so I spent a while going round in circles....
