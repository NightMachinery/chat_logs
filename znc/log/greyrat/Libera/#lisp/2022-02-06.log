[06:37:22] <sm2n> don't put trailing parens on a separate line
[06:37:35] <sm2n> as for why it doesn't work, your body code is in the let bindings list

[07:46:25] <aeth> Unlike most languages, Lisps make scope explicit. Not indenting LET/LET* properly defeats this property of the language.
[07:47:06] <aeth> it's quite clear with something like this that x is contained to that scope: (let ((x 42)) (+ x x))
[07:47:26] <aeth> but once you use more than one line, you really have to pay attention to where you put the lines and how you indent it

[09:49:29] <moon-child> memory corruption is just a symptom
[09:49:41] <moon-child> you can always have 'memory corruption' at the level of your abstracitons
[09:49:54] <moon-child> the problem comes when it's difficult, cumbersome, or even impossible to create such abstractions
[09:50:23] <moon-child> it's easy to write int x[] = {1, 2, 3}; x[5], but hard to write int_array x = make_int_array((int[]){1, 2, 3}, 3)

[09:58:00] <edgar-rft> Good morning Everything! :-)
[10:02:05] <sm2n> That is true, you can write C in any language
[10:02:30] <sm2n> but only in some languages does that let you run shellcode
[10:03:09] <sm2n> though you could argue that some forms of weird machines are buffer overflows in disguise, I suppose, to continue that line of thought
[10:03:12] *** Parts: Everything (~Everythin@37.115.210.35) ()
[10:03:24] <moon-child> in c, shellcode is generally dead
[10:03:48] <moon-child> even ROP can be trivially defeated by switching calling conventions, but compilers are ... reluctant
[10:03:52] <moon-child> for ... reasons
[10:05:39] <sm2n> I don't think W^X is universal yet
[10:06:24] <moon-child> you don't need W^X enforced.  You just need ... not X.  Which you generally get
[10:06:33] <sm2n> for calling conventions, compatibility, I would guess, though that hasn't stopped glibc devs historically (I know, they have backwards compatibility and not forwards, but still)
[10:07:02] <edgar-rft> sm2n: C is very low-level, not all languages provide such a destructive ways of programming. Destructive meant in a neutral sense, most programming languages for example try to save you from producing segfaults by *not* providing direct memory manipulation. What means you can't write C in *all* languages.
[10:07:09] <moon-child> very few c applications have genuine use for executable memory.  Moreover, if you _do_ have use for executable memory, language safety isn't going to save you; you could just generate the wrong code
[10:07:15] <sm2n> what alternate calling convention would you propose?
[10:07:23] <moon-child> separate call/data stacks
[10:07:29] <moon-child> (NB. This is completely backwards compatible!)
[10:07:52] <sm2n> It is‽
[10:08:16] <sm2n> Actually, that makes sense
[10:08:44] <sm2n> Why have I never heard of that approach?
[10:08:46] <moon-child> there is some complication with calling a new-abi function from an old-abi one.  But the reverse works fine
[10:09:28] <sm2n> Also, yes, I agree. But it's not fair to read so much into a simple jab at a prone target :)

[22:52:38] <sm2n> untyped lambda calculus doesn't

[22:58:45] <sm2n> well that's the thing
[22:59:01] <sm2n> in untyped lambda calculus whenever you have a type error you get stuck
[22:59:17] <sm2n> there's no recovery strategy or anything, that's the point
[22:59:19] <moon-child> I don't think it happens 'whenever'
[22:59:20] <sm2n> it's formalized that way
[22:59:26] <moon-child> you will also get nonsense results sometimes
[22:59:38] <sm2n> What do you mean?

[23:00:21] <ASau> Personally, I don't follow either.
[23:00:29] <sm2n> you mean like using church numerals as regular functions?
[23:00:34] <ASau> Sure, you can implement pure lambda calculus, but why?
[23:01:00] <moon-child> sm2n: yes, something like that.  When you use a term in a different fashion than you intended to

[23:01:35] <ASau> sm2n: now I don't follow even when starting from here.
[23:02:20] <ASau> Addition of numerals defined as application of one numeral to another, or?
[23:02:37] <moon-child> yeah that specific case doesn't make sense
[23:02:57] <sm2n> I think I was assuming that there was at least one non-function value, like lambda calculus with additive natural numbers
[23:02:57] <moon-child> but imagine using a church-encoded list where you meant to use a boolean
[23:03:04] <ASau> Repetitive application of some function is defined as application of numeral to said function, or?
[23:03:44] <sm2n> yes, well you could use it wrong, you could do for ex 1_c f_c
[23:04:03] <sm2n> where _c denotes that they are church encoded
[23:04:25] <ASau> char *x= "asdf"; int y = 10; x+y; /* C */
[23:04:44] <ASau> How does that differ?
[23:05:15] <sm2n> I sentence you to the array hole!
[23:05:26] <ASau> char x = 'a'; int y = 10; x+y;
[23:05:29] <moon-child> c is not known for being very strongly typed
[23:06:45] <ASau> Lambda calculus too.
[23:07:48] <ASau> Note that I don't bring up examples from _really_ untyped languages, like one of mentioned above.
[23:08:06] <sm2n> yeah, I'm not entirely sure what we're talking about now either
[23:08:18] <sm2n> it's one of those days
[23:08:31] <ASau> Anyway.
[23:08:52] <ASau> sm2n: if you're interested in the topic of separation of data and control stacks, I suggest that you read about Krivine machines.
[23:09:01] <ASau> First.
[23:09:07] *** Joins: ewwegweg (~ewwegweg@user/ewwegweg)
[23:09:12] <ASau> Only then, optionally, you can read about Forth.
[23:10:01] <sm2n> lol okay
[23:10:02] <ASau> If you're acquainted to KMs, you understand that programming in Forth feels like operating some primitive simulation of KM directly.
[23:10:23] <ASau> Something like programming Turing machine directly.
[23:10:55] <ASau> Also, you may refresh your knowledge of SECD.
[23:11:03] <ASau> Just to feel relation.
[23:11:20] <sm2n> what's the canonical reference?
[23:11:30] <ASau> Ufff....
[23:11:49] <ASau> Do you mind searching it youself?
[23:12:14] <sm2n> sure, I just asked in case you had something off the top of your head you like
[23:12:23] <ASau> I just don't have my archive reachable, and thus I'll have to do it just like you.
[23:13:29] <ASau> It _may_ be useful, it you start searching around works of Xavier Leroy of O'Caml.
[23:14:22] <ASau> Or maybe his early works from the time preceding O'Caml.
[23:17:14] *** Quits: Thom2503 (~Thom2503@248-217-158-163.dynamic.caiway.nl) (Quit: Leaving...)
[23:18:27] <masinter> i need a glossery of current irc slang. O'Caml= ????
[23:18:36] <ASau> While we are on such deeply theoretical topics...
[23:18:54] <ASau> Does anyone know how one could measure complexity of algorithm in algol-type language?
[23:19:11] <masinter> does the language matter?
[23:19:18] <ASau> Yes.
[23:19:31] <ASau> Target application is Java and C.
[23:20:05] <ASau> No C++ with all its heavy templatology.
[23:20:38] <masinter> is C "algol-like"?
[23:20:43] <ASau> Sure.
[23:21:13] <masinter> it depends on the linearity of the language to implementation cost
[23:21:13] <moon-child> 'kolmogorov complexity', I think?
[23:22:09] <masinter> in Lisp it's easy to write things that are order N^2 in list length
[23:22:34] <moon-child> oh, computational complexity
[23:22:47] <ASau> moon-child: something in the line of Kolmogorov, yes.
[23:22:56] <moon-child> oh nvm
[23:23:05] <ASau> Run-time/space complexity doesn't matter.
[23:24:02] <ASau> I need something to estimate probability of mistake introduced when implementing/reimplementing algorithm.
[23:25:27] <masinter> who would make the mistake
[23:25:41] <ASau> Theoretically, there are some nearly anecdotical references to number of lines, but, I'm afraid, this depends on formatting, plus it doesn't take into consideration modern tooling like syntax highlighting.
[23:26:00] <masinter> doesn't it depend more on the mistake-makers frame of reference?
[23:26:22] <moon-child> yeah doesn't make much sense to me either
[23:26:47] <masinter> I'd think these days you'd use AI/Machine learning to figure out what factors are a good prediction
[23:26:47] <moon-child> if you reimplement an algorithm and make a small mistake, is that likely to affect the overall complexity of the implementation?
[23:27:08] <moon-child> and: what's to say you don't simplify--or complicate--the implementation when porting it anyway?
[23:27:31] <masinter> how likely is it that the result will cause the computer running the algorithm to explode
[23:27:53] <moon-child> :D
[23:27:57] <moon-child> 'lp0 on fire'
[23:29:16] <masinter> why isn't porting software like language translation
[23:29:39] <moon-child> cuz the latter is called 'compilation'
[23:29:44] <moon-child> (kinda kinda)
[23:30:26] <masinter> someone gave me a file from Greenblat's garage archives tapes
[23:30:52] <masinter> written for LMI lisp... called "Interlisp"
