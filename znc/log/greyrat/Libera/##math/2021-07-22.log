[00:00:43] <biberao> -s
[00:00:44] <biberao> so
[00:00:46] <biberao> its life
[00:01:44] <biberao> brb
[00:01:45] <Z-module> I thought all of Europe had free school through the end of high school
[00:01:47] <biberao> going to take the trash
[00:01:57] <biberao> Z-module: but when i was studying
[00:02:07] <biberao> it wasnt to that extent
[00:02:50] <biberao> only foreigns might have the luck to study for free

[03:34:17] <Z-module> I had a very fun "TV moment" last night, catching up on an older wacky series that mostly has wild nonsense going, nothing at all technical. But this high-school kid in it turns out to be a great math student, and he's boning up on stuff.

[03:35:41] <Z-module> Funny thing: with the English subtitles for this turned it, it said "infinite solutions for..."   I've seen lots of people make this mistake. I think they must think it's the correct way, similar to "one solution", "two solutions", etc.

[07:36:51] <pikapika> Z-module, I am just wondering how cosines etc are accurately calculated in digital hardware
[07:37:24] <pikapika> Either we have the inaccuracy introduced due to the 'pi' fraction in the series expansion
[07:37:50] <pikapika> or if we are using the phasor binary search trick, we still need to construct the table of cos(p/4),cos(p/8),cos(p,16)... somehow
[07:39:44] <pikapika> even if the table construction is a one-time job obviously, if we wish ot avoid pi fractions we might for instance start from cos(p/4)=sqrt(.5) and then build up half cosines by sqrt(0.5*(1+cosx)) say, that still has the problem of having to do it to about k*2^table_size digits accuracy so the cosine for the smallest angle is correct to the full digits required

[11:17:01] <Samian> I'm mad that I found a way to understand matrix multiplication that wasn't taught in school
[11:17:08] <Samian> and it all makes perfect sense now
[11:17:41] <Fangs> Samian: do share
[11:19:05] <Samian> for Matrix A times Matrix B = matrix C.   Draw a grid for matrix C.  Draw Matrix A to the right of the grid aligned with the rows.  Draw Matrix B above the grid aligned with the columns.
[11:20:22] <Samian> Where a row of Matrix A intersects with a column of Matrix B, that's where the dot product of the two vectors is stored.
[11:21:05] <Samian> Fangs  does that make sense?
[11:21:08] <Fangs> yeah
[11:21:22] <Fangs> what's your background?
[11:21:26] <Samian> Have you ever seen matrix multiplication setup that way?
[11:21:36] <Samian> Fangs  I work for facebook doing ai
[11:21:56] <Fangs> presentation is new, but this is a nice intepretation of an alternative way to define matrices
[11:23:23] <Fangs> let U, V, W be vector spaces, then a "matrix" from U to V may be thought of as an element of U* (x) V and from V to W as an element of V* (x) W
[11:23:28] <Fangs> V* denotes the dual
[11:24:14] <Fangs> Samian: you can 'evaluate' an element from U* (x) V and V* (x) W by plugging in stuff from V into the V* stuff
[11:24:38] <Fangs> (in more concrete terms, V is col matrix, V* is row matrix and the 'evaluation' is just the dot product usually)

[12:17:50] <Fangs> so let a, b, c be homogeneous element of A, I want to compute [a]*[b|c]
[12:18:46] <Fangs> I think this should be [a]|[1*(b|c)] + P(something) [b]|[a*c], and [a]*[c] should be [a]|[1*c] + P(something) [c] | [a*[]]?

[12:41:42] <Fangs> for what its worth this is where they talk about shuffles, and I don't think they're any more enlightening
[12:43:57] <cherim__> A shuffle has a natural sign based on the number of disorders
[12:44:44] <Fangs> do explain
[12:44:46] <cherim__> If you replace every letter that came from the first string with 0 and every letter from the second string by 1, then it's the (-1)^{disorders in the 0/1 string}

[14:12:04] <jwpapi> wow why are the reviews so bad https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/LfeAjIOh/image.png
[14:12:47] <lisp123> jwpapi: that is a mystery to me :-) I was shocked to see those reviews. BUT, I have seen many books with great reviews that haven't been so great, so now I discount reviews generally
[14:13:50] <lisp123> perhaps different people like different learning styles, but for me it was a masterpiece as it taught me not only a very large portion of statistics but also the whys

[14:16:03] <lisp123> I think most of the reviews dont like it because its a concise book (covers a lot but not too much words) and also the exercises are relatively simple then get hard
[14:16:38] <lisp123> for me, the simple exercises really helped drill in concepts (I did every one in the book) and gave me confidence, and because I'm more mathematical vs. someone non-mathematical and trying to simply use statistics in their work
[14:16:44] <lisp123> i preferred the concise and precise definitions
[14:16:58] <jmorris> jwpapi: I'm asking what YOU know, why would you need a list
[14:17:25] <lisp123> Where it excelled for me was giving me the deeper understanding of statistics, for example WHY would one use expected value as a relevant statistic in a problem?
[14:18:19] <lisp123> (the answer being - if we assume the future will be similar to the past, then expected value is the best unbiased estimator or something like that - been a while since I did stats :-)

[15:06:00] <jwpapi> Jmorris because it's been years since I touched the topics. Probably a lot of stuff  I'll understand once I revisited it
[15:06:39] <jwpapi> lisp123: yes I understand and not always we can assume that future will be like the past
[15:07:25] <lisp123> jwpapi: true words :-) One of the biggest and most inaccurate assumptions made in many models (especially time series)
[15:07:36] <jwpapi> I always wondered how you can check hypothesis test with past data.

[15:08:56] <jmorris> jwpapi: if you can't even say what you know then the answer is that you don't know anything
[15:09:08] <jmorris> so starting from the beginning is probably the best idea
[15:10:23] <jwpapi> And I had a couple of strategies that were candidates. And then I could just let it run on my database and see how many standard deviations it was better than random bets. But if I test a 100 strategies it's likely to find one with being 99% significant
[15:10:48] <jmorris> but again you haven't specified what your actual goal is by learning statistics

[16:00:11] <Z-module> looking
[16:01:37] <Z-module> HN/N isn't even *meaningful* as a group unless N is normal.
[16:01:42] <Z-module> So you used it that way.
[16:02:16] <Z-module> plus HN isn't necessarily a subgroup of G without one of H, N being normal
[16:02:47] <Z-module> oh, you mean in the example part at bottom?
[16:02:58] <Z-module> well, same remarks
[16:04:08] <Z-module> and you know of course that in abelian groups like this, all subgroups are normal
[16:04:16] <cadmio> ah right, but it could just a quotient set
[16:04:27] <Z-module> it's not commonly notated like that
[16:04:56] <Z-module> in group theory,  (big group)/(subgroup)   nearly always means the quotient group, meaning that the subgroup is normal.
[16:05:22] <cadmio> ok
[16:06:03] <Z-module> you're right that we do deal with "the set of all left cosets of H" as a set for G to act on, but notating that set as G/H is confusing and very rare.

[16:08:59] <Z-module> why call it  (1/3)^i   instead of  3^i ?   Since i ranges over all of Z, these give the same set.
[16:09:26] <Z-module> you could, but it's very confusing, practically never done
[16:09:35] <Z-module> (as notation)
[16:09:51] <Z-module> especially since we sometimes talk about "double cosets" which have the notation  H\G/K

[16:11:13] <cadmio> the other times (another exercise) we used the notation h + N instead of hN because that was an additive group rather than multiplicative, right?
[16:11:28] <Z-module> yes
[16:12:02] <jwpapi> Jmorris assuming I know nothing what do u recommend is the best to start?
[16:12:10] <Z-module> and if it was some *abstract* abelian group, not a specific thing that's a subset of the reals or something familiar like that, you could still use the generic notation  hN  there
[16:12:51] <Z-module> there isn't any true distinction between additive and multiplicative groups other than notation, except when you're talking about substructures of rings where the two separate operations are already in place.
[16:13:16] *** Quits: slidercrank (~slidercra@user/slidercrank) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[16:13:23] <cadmio> and when I studied quotient ring modulo an ideal I used to indicated as a +I never as aI
[16:13:28] <Z-module> so like the real field R has the additive group (R, +), and multiplicative gruop (R\{0}, *)
[16:13:56] <Z-module> yes because quotient rings are actually (to start with) quotients of the *additive* group of the whole ring
[16:14:04] <Z-module> on which we then also define a new ring multiplication
[16:15:14] <cadmio> ok so I was considering only additive groups and not multiplicative ones
[16:15:18] <Z-module> the additive group is defined (as a group) for all possible additive subgroups of the ring, but the new ring multiplication only meaningfully works when the subgroup is an ideal (which is stronger than just being a subring)
[16:16:54] <Z-module> oh I see why you used (1/3)^i in there -- they posed the problem as "the subgroup generated by 1/3".  So you're not wrong, but it's nicer-looking if you write that subgroup as  {3^i : i in Z}
[16:17:09] <Z-module> (same thing as what you have, since (1/3)^i = 3^(-i) )
[16:17:28] <Z-module> anyway that's just an aesthetic point, not important
[16:18:22] <Z-module> the very general thing I used there is that if X is any subset of a group G, then <X> = <X'>  where X' is the set you obtain by replacing some or all the things in X by their inverses.
[16:18:34] <cherim> When will the exercises with deeper content finally start...
[16:18:47] <Z-module> becauase the <.> operation (subgroup generated by) already lets you invert anything in sight

[16:19:17] <cadmio> the concept of 'coset' was introduced with groups but it's basically the same concept studied with quotient rings, that I studied first
[16:19:43] <Z-module> "Show, in fewer than 45 pages, and without ultra-high-powered tools, that if G is any finite nonabelian simple group, every g in G is a commutator element."

[16:20:52] <Z-module> cadmio, yes, though in rings the group involved (the ring's additive group) is abelian, so you never worry about normality, etc.
[16:21:05] *** Joins: seninha (~seninha@user/seninha)
[16:21:57] <Z-module> cadmio, also, you might wonder if it's "abitrary" that we define addition in rings to be commutative by axiom. It's actually unavoidable in any ring with 1: if you eliminate that axiom from the ring axioms, but keep the 1 in there, you can still *prove* that addition is commutative. Kind of neat.
[16:22:01] *** Quits: bitdex (~bitdex@gateway/tor-sasl/bitdex) (Quit: = "")
[16:22:28] <cadmio> so there is no multiplicative ring counterpart?
[16:22:42] <Z-module> no, lots of rings have non-commutative multiplication
[16:22:44] <cadmio> I mean 'quotient'
[16:22:51] <Z-module> oh, there is
[16:23:35] <Z-module> But if S is a ring, S\{0} is quite often not a multiplicative group.  It does have subsets that are.
[16:24:53] <cadmio> so the role of the ideal in quotient rings is now played by Normal groups
[16:25:10] <Z-module> you could maybe say that
[16:25:16] <Z-module> but to me this is a backwards approach
[16:25:29] <Z-module> most algebra-intro book authors agree with me and do group stuff first. A few don't.

[18:25:15] <johnkeats6> buster, a quantum field is sorta like having a quantum harmonic oscillator at each point in space (actually momentum space). the creation operator which creates a quantum in that case creates a particle. the oscillators are coupled together so the quatum can travel from place to place and you've got a particle moving around

[19:38:22] <Gurkenglas> Right, because the operators actually take in a list of operands rather than two, and associativity lets you express this with a binary operation. Why does linearity keep coming up?

[19:43:58] <johnkeats6> it's possible to understand the klein-gordon eq as a limit of a system of (classical) coupled harmonic oscillators (in position space) too. it's just that going to momentum space "decouples" them
[19:45:23] <Z-module> OK, so M is a 2-manifold.  f, g are continuous real-valued functions on M.  So it's pretty hard to imagine what they mean by  \bar{f(S)}   where S is a point of M.
[19:46:15] <johnkeats6> it should mean complex conjugate
[19:46:22] <johnkeats6> they probably typo'd the C as an R there
[19:46:29] <Z-module> possibly it's a typo and they wanted f, g in  C^0(M, C)  -- complex-valued.
[19:46:38] <Z-module> yeah
[19:47:04] <johnkeats6> observables should form a C* algebra, which needs to have a * operation. in the canonical example, you have M_n(C), and * is the (complex) adjoint. for 1x1 matrices it's conjugation

[19:49:18] <fweht> johnkeats6: ok, that makes sense
[19:49:20] <johnkeats6> i guess maybe that's the point -- the 'self-adjoint' elements in M --> C are the real-valued ones
[19:49:34] <cherim> Note that it's R everywhere, including a\in R in 2.2
[19:49:51] <cherim> It matters what the paper does in general
[19:50:03] <fweht> cherim: it started to make sense after reading further
[19:50:45] <fweht> they tried to model those observables as self-adjoint operators, so they reused the definitions in a complex-valued setting
[19:51:18] <johnkeats6> probably they're trying to draw the parallel between classical and quantum mechanics?
[19:51:37] <fweht> johnkeats6: i just wondered if there is a more fundamental intuition to adjoints, when i think of observables as operators which take a state and deliver a complex expectation value
[19:53:38] <johnkeats6> fweht, i think the physicist answer would be that self-adjoint operators have real eigenvalues. that never satisfied me too much. it makes perfect sense that the hamiltonian H should be self-adjoint, so that (equivalently) e^(iH) (the evolution) is unitary

[19:57:02] <int-e> Gurkenglas: Not really, I just picked a natural question that would convey the same information.
[19:57:14] <johnkeats6> fweht, i don't know. absolutely any (let's say continuous) function on the phase space should be 'observable' in the intuitive sense, complex valued or not (after all you could just separately observe the real and imaginary parts)
[19:57:29] <Gurkenglas> huh, sold
[19:57:31] <int-e> Gurkenglas: I.e., I was aware that the answer would be negated.
[19:57:53] <Gurkenglas> yeah, you're right, that's how we should do these things
[19:58:16] <johnkeats6> in the classical world you can carefully observe p and q. so obviously you can compute f(p, q) for any well-defined f
[19:58:26] <Gurkenglas> the reason i suspected "Yes, all of them." is that commutative, associative operations "actually" take in a set of operands, and noncommutative, associative operations take in a list of operands, and paths in a graph seem much more natural than lists
[19:58:38] <johnkeats6> continuity is just because your measurement of p, q is never perfect, so you wouldn't want discontinuities
[19:59:09] <fweht> yeah makes sense
[19:59:30] <cherim> Observables are self-adjoint and evolution is unitary in almost all scenarios. But if yoy condition on something of this broken, non-unitary evolution is of more use in physics than non-real observables

[22:23:15] <int-e> acresearch: As far as I can make out, that term seems to originate in machine learning literature, where it's used to describe (approximation) algorithms that have some known error bound, in contrast to other "heuristic" algorithms that are only supported by experimental data.
[22:23:59] <int-e> Weird stuff.
[22:25:16] <mawk> if I have an equation like \int_0^x f(t)dt = xf(x)², then it should be equivalent to taking derivative on both sides no?
[22:25:31] <mawk> taking derivative on both sides I find that f(x) = 1+C/√x
[22:25:45] <mawk> but when I plug back that f in the original integral I get C² = 0
[22:26:06] <riv> derivative of both sides? hmm
[22:26:10] <mawk> but C must be > 0 due to how it's constructed

[22:26:16] <riv> it looks valid

[22:26:51] <mawk> f(x)² + 2xf'(x)f(x)
[22:26:59] <riv> ok thats what i get too
[22:27:05] <riv> so
[22:27:16] <riv> f(x) = f(x)^2 + 2 x f'(x) f(x)
[22:27:18] <riv> does this help us?
[22:27:19] <mawk> then I simplified by f(x) assuming it's ≠ 0
[22:27:21] <mawk> yes
[22:27:29] <riv> im not sure that's valid?
[22:27:34] <mawk> then you solve that with f(x) = 1 + C/√x
[22:27:37] <mawk> why not valid?
[22:27:43] <riv> does f(x) =/= 0 mean its not the zero function, or that it's never zero on any inut?
[22:27:44] <mawk> you can assume f(x) ≠ 0 I think
[22:27:44] <riv> input*
[22:28:04] <mawk> it's never zero
[22:28:12] <riv> i see
[22:28:40] <riv> what about
[22:28:41] <mawk> but f = 0 somewhere is a contradiction I think
[22:28:51] <riv> f(x)^2 + (2 x f'(x) - 1) f(x) = 0
[22:29:14] <riv> f(x) = 1 - 2 x f'(x)

[22:31:28] <mawk> d/dx (ln(g(x)) = -1/2 x is what you get by rewriting
[22:31:40] <mawk> so g(x) = C/√x, assuming x ≥ 0
[22:31:50] <riv> oh that's really nicely done
[22:32:00] <mawk> otherwise it's C/√|x| but we don't like negative values
[22:32:55] *** Joins: xad231 (~xad231@user/xad231)
[22:32:57] <mawk> I think the difference between the initial integral eqn and the differentiated version is that the former can tell us the initial condition
