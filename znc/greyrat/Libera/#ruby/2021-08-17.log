[12:21:05] <Guest47> it's make sense, in fact i want to contribute in GsoC in Ruby particularly, so this my purpose for my Question jhass[m]
[12:21:48] <jhass[m]> so does that require C?

[12:30:19] <Guest47> yes, some of projects is requisite :C+ruby, My question about i should to learn C in parallel? or focus in ruby first. 
[12:30:39] <Guest47> https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4697800446574592/
[12:31:18] <Guest47> check the idea list If you don't have an idea about it 
[12:34:12] <leftylink> isn't there the saying that each individual has a different learning style, or has that been debunked?
[12:34:29] <leftylink> because if it's true that each individual has a different learning style, whether one should learn two things at once or one thing at a time depends on the individual.
[12:36:08] <leftylink> okay, I guess https://www.educationnext.org/stubborn-myth-learning-styles-state-teacher-license-prep-materials-debunked-theory/ says the visual style etc. is debunked
[12:37:29] <leftylink> and https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-myth-of-learning-styles/557687/
[12:38:51] <leftylink> but these sorts of learning styles are different from whether someone can/should learn multiple things at once
[12:40:21] <leftylink> my search for "learn two languages at once or one at a time" turns up https://blog.duolingo.com/can-you-learn-two-languages-at-the-same-time/ as first result.
[12:41:46] <Guest47> you learned me a new lesson today, I think i should to explore myself more ,thanks leftylink
[12:44:10] <nakilon> in my university you was supposed to learn 10 languages in 5 years one by one, not at the same time
[12:47:57] <leftylink> there is also the consideration... learning is never complete.
[12:48:06] <leftylink> learning is a continuous process
[12:48:52] <leftylink> but I suppose the question here will be whether to split time between two languages as a beginner in both, or get some level of proficiency and fluency in one before starting on another
[12:51:31] <leftylink> interesting choice
[12:52:14] <Guest47> exactly that's what's i mean, i was described it in wrong way

[13:40:50] <jhass[m]> yes, only you can answer this the best. Consider if you learn better by reading something upfront or exploring something as you go. In the latter case learning both at once can be viable IMO, if you have drivers for it as well. If you're more into focusing on something soaking in as much as possible, I imagine that to be less effective doing for two things at once. C and Ruby in fact are presenting quite different challenges and approaches and in turn are
[13:40:50] <jhass[m]> also better suited for quite distinct problem domains (not saying there's no overlap at all of course). A final consideration I would make is previous background. If there's little experience with programming in general beforehand then I would definitely recommend to focus on Ruby first and then learn how C is different. If there's previous knowledge in something that's quite comparable to one of them, then picking up that other similar thing on the side
[13:40:50] <jhass[m]> with the more new concepts might become quite achievable
[13:52:24] <Guest47> in fact i appreciate your all words thanks A lot jhass[m]

[23:09:22] <nesoi> I have an old program that is using ruby 2.4.1 and won't run now because it wants to load openssl 1.0.0, what's the easiest way to run it? 
[23:09:48] <adam12> nesoi: If you need to stick with 2.4.1, probably Docker.
[23:11:06] <adam12> nesoi: No chance of upgrading tho? I didn't think there was anything breaking from 2.4 to 2.5 (or even 2.6)
[23:16:32] <nesoi> ok so what's the easiest way to upgrade? btw, I'm on macos :/
[23:16:42] <nesoi> need to upgrade all the gems too I guess
[23:17:29] <adam12> nesoi: You likely want to use a Ruby version manager. There's a few options: frum, chruby, rbenv, and rvm.
[23:17:38] <adam12> nesoi: I'm presuming you're using system ruby.
[23:18:20] <adam12> nesoi: You'll need to install the gems, but may not need to upgrade them. You can't generally re-use the same gem install across Ruby because of the Ruby ABI isn't guaranteed to be stable.
[23:19:12] <nesoi> I think I'm using brew ruby
[23:19:22] <nesoi> not sure though
[23:19:25] <adam12> nesoi: Ah. Definitely install a Ruby version manager then.
[23:19:34] <nesoi> what's the easiest to deal with?
[23:19:49] <adam12> nesoi: I'm using Frum lately. It's built in Rust and reasonably nice (but new). My second choice is chruby, but you need to pair it with a Ruby installer like `ruby-install`.
[23:20:03] <nesoi> I don't have a lot of time for this though, just want to get this running

[23:26:07] <nesoi> hm Error: No available formula or cask with the name "frum".
[23:26:33] <nesoi> I also have no idea how I'd use this to get the program running
[23:27:27] <weaksauce> chruby is easiest to get going
[23:27:36] <weaksauce> use that with ruby-install
[23:27:47] <nesoi> ok but what am I installing?
[23:28:26] <weaksauce> you need to install a newer ruby like 2.6 then install chruby into your shell script and use it like chruby 2.6
[23:28:40] <weaksauce> shell script being your bash or zsh startup 
[23:30:28] <nesoi> hm
[23:30:37] <nesoi> and this does what?
[23:31:22] <weaksauce> it sets up your path to use the ruby and gem dirs where a user installed ruby is 
[23:31:37] <weaksauce> ruby-install compiles it 
[23:31:50] <weaksauce> chruby changes the ruby
[23:32:05] <nesoi> ok so why do I want to do that?
[23:32:11] <nesoi> instead of just upgrading it?

[23:32:53] <weaksauce> upgrading system ruby is not advised
[23:34:15] <nesoi> if I run ruby-install it says the latest version is 2.4.1
[23:34:19] <nesoi> which I have
[23:37:01] <nesoi> hm. I already had chruby installed
[23:37:57] <nesoi> for chruby 2.6 it says unknown Ruby: 2.6

[23:41:42] <weaksauce> yeah you need to install ruby 2.6

[23:53:25] <rapha> hi all
[23:54:04] <rapha> while inside the File.open(..., 'w'){|f| ...} block, right after f.write, is there a way to "take back"/"undo" the last character written?
[23:56:27] <rapha> like ... f.write("\bx") ... and then have "x" there instead of whatever would have been there before. which obviously won't work, because you'll get y^Hx instead.
