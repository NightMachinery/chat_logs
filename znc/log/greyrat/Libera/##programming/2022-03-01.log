[01:24:04] <pyzozord> essentially inversion of control principle is just "write plugins" and dependency injection is a concrete plugin architectural pattern
[01:24:27] <pyzozord> I think I personally really disagree with inversion of control principle
[01:25:05] <pyzozord> you are not in control, things are hard to debug, the thing that calls you is usually complex and messy...

[01:26:01] <pyzozord> although that depends, callbacks, schedulers, event loops all are very useful
[01:26:12] <pyzozord> dependency injection less so, it's quite terrible imo
[01:26:40] <deniska> depends…
[01:26:58] <deniska> DI is just a fancy way of saying "passing stuff around"
[01:27:13] <deniska> which is generally a good thing because you are avoiding globals
[01:27:23] <pyzozord> it usually has like registries and stuff biulds stuff

[01:27:45] <nomagno> The only valid way of designing APIs is from caller to implementation IMO
[01:27:49] <deniska> depends on a language, in more dynamic languages it's easier to pass objects/classes around
[01:27:51] <nomagno> Callbacks may be used but that's because it's an overly useful structure

[01:29:19] <pyzozord> I don't see what DI really solves tbh
[01:30:09] <deniska> pyzozord: it solves a problem which appears when you have multiple variants of what you can inject
[01:30:55] <deniska> maybe you have different ways you access database in normal execution, on a dev machine, and during tests

[01:32:42] <pyzozord> So wiki page says "How can a class be independent from the creation of the objects it depends on? How can the way objects are created be specified in separate configuration files? How can an application support different configurations?"
[01:33:39] <pyzozord> the first one is fair enough, when you do lots of OOP you'll maybe wanna make the classes less coupled
[01:33:53] *** Joins: ProfSimm (~ProfSimm@87.227.196.109)
[01:33:58] <pyzozord> but the configuration stuff is just not useful
[01:34:13] <pyzozord> it takes just as long to change it in the code as it takes to change it in the configuration
[01:34:30] <pyzozord> and you gotta know the code anyway, so the configuraiton is just wasted complexity
[01:34:33] <deniska> configuration can be managed separately from code
[01:34:55] <nomagno> You know, a long standing issue of mine is that in many languages you need to do a mapping from string to identifier
[01:35:00] *** Quits: u0_a83 (~hexingb@111.30.224.251) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[01:35:32] <nomagno> I can't read a field from config then treat that as the variable to read from, I need to write boring boilerplate to translate from "var" to `var`
[01:35:41] <nomagno> Specially happens with compiled languages
[01:35:46] <ProfSimm> I came up with an odd/interesting concept... you can receive arguments anywhere in a function, and the arguments may be merged into the parent scope. I.e.  a -> a * a works, but also make a binding "a" in the parent scope
[01:35:48] <pyzozord> deniska: these all seem like plugin features, not something to use as the backbone of a framework
[01:36:01] <ProfSimm> Scope and receiveing arguments is two separate things basically.
[01:36:03] <pyzozord> I mean a plugin-system features
[01:36:22] <deniska> pyzozord: as I said, you don't need a fully fledged framework to do DI
[01:36:29] <deniska> pyzozord: it's just passing things around
[01:36:53] <pyzozord> my experience with DI is mostly as the core of a big framework
[01:37:01] <deniska> pyzozord: `def __init__(self, foo): self.foo = foo` as opposed to `def __init__(self): self.foo = Foo()`
[01:37:04] <deniska> the former is DI
[01:37:04] <nomagno> ProfSimm: That violates principle 1 of static scoping: scopes need to make sense
[01:37:15] <ProfSimm> deniska: the reason people use frameworks is because passing things around doesn't scale if it's flat (bunch of arguments) and no one taught them how to structure their code so it's not flat
[01:37:43] <deniska> yes, but it's a starting point, only switch to something more frameworkey if you actually need it
[01:37:43] <nomagno> What does flat code look like?
[01:37:48] <nomagno> Don't know what you mean
[01:37:56] <ProfSimm> nomagno: it makes sense. In context. This is a scope:  {}  so if you type {a -> a * a} it works like a "normal" closure

[01:39:31] <ProfSimm> nomagno: flat code as in, if you have 10 dependencies, would you pass 10 arguments? Option 1) Yes  Option 2) Compose them in objects  3) Just switch to denial mode and say "oh if you have 10 dependencies, your code is wrong"

[01:41:29] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: DI doesn't make things hard to track, it makes things much easier to track compared to alternatives

[01:42:31] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: but you need to pass some things in. Basically your object's configuration, or context, or environment if you will. That's DI
[01:42:44] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: DI containers though basically emulate global variables, so that sucks
[01:43:04] <pyzozord> yeah that's just passing things you need around
[01:43:10] <pyzozord> or mostly pointers to things you need
[01:43:27] <ProfSimm> Autowiring containers defeat the point of DI.

[01:49:39] <ProfSimm> deniska: it's a solved problem way I see it. Do most of your config in code, and the rest that's user-facing or deployment specific use something simple like a JSON, INI file, or if you have the UI for it, an sqlite db
[01:50:15] <pyzozord> I don't see a point for adding configuration files for code that you completely own anyway
[01:50:26] <pyzozord> especially in interpreted languages

[01:51:43] <jeaye> i.e I own bayaz's code, but he still loads up his runtime data from a config file, since that data varies from dev and prod and I don't want them baked in the code.
[01:51:50] <ProfSimm> deniska: or even in a Python file that's not in your repo, but is config.
[01:51:55] <deniska> ProfSimm: sure, but you still have to write custom code to read from that config, and you need to specify the path to this config somehow

[01:52:16] <ProfSimm> deniska: well, luckily reading JSON is a one-liner
[01:52:54] <pyzozord> sure for every different database connection you have to customize you have hundred other classes that don't need to be customizable like this all that much
[01:52:59] <deniska> the problem with that in the context of django is that everyone might be doing it slightly differently, so when you open someone else's django project, you need to figure out "how do they do settings?"
[01:53:21] <pyzozord> so might as well just write database stuff so that it is customizable, and leave rest alone
[01:53:28] <ProfSimm> deniska: it helps if the project has  config.EXAMPLE.json
[01:53:38] <ProfSimm> You open it, it's basic, you copy rename, done
[01:53:40] <pyzozord> no need for system increasing complexity for the entire system

[01:56:15] <deniska> pyzozord: it's one of these basic things one would expect a framework to handle. Like, when working on a django project, you typically don't have to look how they do views, or how they access the DB, because it's handled in a consistant fashion
[01:56:20] <deniska> which is a value of a framework
[01:56:47] <sixpiece> pyzozord the problem I think is not the audience
[01:56:54] <sixpiece> the problem is I cannot do anything
[01:57:00] <sixpiece> everything is so difficult
[01:57:04] <pyzozord> yes that would be a problem too
[01:57:06] <flakland> lol
[01:57:08] <ProfSimm> deniska: way those frameworks work, you know where a view is, but you can't find the right view in a mid-size to big project
[01:57:16] <ProfSimm> deniska: all flat. I hate flat code

[09:05:25] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocad#Windows  "AutoCAD Release 12 in 1992 was the first version of the software to support the Windows platform - in that case Windows 3.1. After Release 14 in 1997, support for MS-DOS, Unix and Macintosh were dropped, and AutoCAD was exclusively Windows supported. In general any new AutoCAD version supports the current Windows version and some older ones. AutoCAD 2016 to 2020 support Windows 7 up to Windows 10."

[10:15:04] <node1> I never did this i would be happy if i got some examples.
[10:15:13] <Decker> Although - the program can try and attach to itself as a debugger and prevent a debugger from attaching; so you'll have to work around that safety latch first probably.
[10:15:47] <sonny> even if you use windbg?
[10:16:00] <Decker> in the end a program that's a crack reads bytes, seeks and writes bytes; any program that can update binary information in a file is an example.  Finding what bytes and where has nothing to do with the program.

[12:07:45] <ProfSimm> sonny: see, I realized something. We can think of functions as streams. Writing to a stream is passing an argument. Reading is forcing evaluation to read a result. And when you read a result, there's the question 1) I still have the function, and the result, I have two things now 2) are those equivalent or not  
[12:07:57] <ProfSimm> sonny: in FP they are. But in any other style they're not.

[12:09:42] <ProfSimm> sonny: yeah. Seen this mentioned before here. 
[12:09:57] <beaky> ProfSimm: yes one area where this may not hold is equality, an example is equality of functions, so it gets into intensional vs extensional equality: functions are equal if and only if they are one and the same function (according to the intensional i.e. internal definition), vs. functions f and g are equal if and only if for all x, f x = g x ( function extensionality

[12:09:59] <bayaz> Title: function extensionality 
[12:11:43] <beaky> so you can have functional programming where functions are not necessarily equal to the result, but then you can then use setoids or quotient types to say 'equivalent with respect to a given equivalence relation'
[12:12:44] <ProfSimm> beaky: good point, makes me wonder if equivalence of functions really makes sense tbh

[12:24:26] <amigojapan> yep Decker

[12:24:49] <Decker> no I mean ue that - and don't get tied to either platform? with any sort of native binding?

[12:25:44] <sonny> (lambda () 1) => always gives 1
[12:25:57] <Decker> sonny if they have arguments, it's easier to argume 3 always returns the same value - and it's a determinisitic funcction

[12:25:59] <ProfSimm> sonny: which is equivalent to just 1

[13:51:53] <password> they need like a 10k multicursor limit

[13:54:57] <PlanckWalk> In a way yes
[13:55:11] <PlanckWalk> In the sense that they can be in a capturing group that you then replace.
[13:55:16] <pyzozord> I don't think it's possible, but I might be wrong
[13:55:26] <password> hmm i think i might need to fix sublime

[13:56:11] *** Quits: ravan (~ravan@user/ravan) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[13:56:31] <PlanckWalk> Since they're zero-width anchors it's a bit awkward to try to say what you mean by "replacing" them.
[13:56:32] <GeDaMo> It's not finding the pattern anyway :P
[13:56:38] <password> yay i did not break sublime
[13:56:46] <GeDaMo> Does vi regex not support ^ and $ ?
[13:56:55] <pyzozord> it does
[13:57:25] <pyzozord> I know I do s/stuff$// in vi often, and I don't think it ever deleted a line
[13:57:28] <pyzozord> just leaves them empty
[13:57:32] <beaky> yes vi regex evolved from ex which evolved from ed which was the original regex
[13:57:39] <PlanckWalk> $ doesn't match a newline character
[13:57:58] <GeDaMo> Yeah, it doesn't remove the line, just blanks it
[13:58:02] <PlanckWalk> It's a *zero-width* match.
[13:58:04] <beaky> i think ken thompson invented regex
[13:58:14] <beaky> (tho not regular languages)
[13:58:14] <password> its find and replace is much much better
[13:58:29] <koollman> it matches the place just between the newline and the character before the newline. not a character :)
[13:59:09] <PlanckWalk> Various regex find-and-replace implementations let you match and replace newlines, though.
[13:59:25] <PlanckWalk> I don't know whether sublime's is one of those.
[13:59:45] <PlanckWalk> I would expect so, since it's a common thing to want in a text editor.

If you link with the import .lib file, it's like the DLL is a part of the program itself to the programmer (mostly).

[20:55:22] <apotheon> React definitely has its conceptual, design appeal, in that there's a simplicity of the approach in theory that seems great in abstract discussion, but in practice it seems like it always ends up a fucking bottomless hole of sprawling complexity for almost any significant project.
[20:55:29] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: I don't disagree with what the page says, except one thing. The model is not about the "data logic and rules of the application". It's about the data, logic and rules of the MVC component. MVC is a component pattern, not an application pattern. That's precisely the abuse that happened since RoR. You may not care about RoR, but they're the first who abused MVC this way, and it picked on since on front and backend

[21:14:54] <apotheon> I'm not talking about the '90s.
[21:15:07] <apotheon> Are you arguing that nothing is MVC on the web unless its UI state is entirely in the browser, as some kind of bizarre need to define what part of the system computes UI state?

[21:43:24] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: I don't understand why you take this as if I'm personally insulting you for some reason. Does it matter if Rails is MVC or not? No. You can make sites with it, so that's cool.
[21:43:41] <apotheon> It feels like ProfSimm thinks that GUI dev is all about designing buttons at this point.
[21:44:01] <apotheon> I'm guessing that's not the case, but . . . wtf.
[21:44:07] <ProfSimm> Yes, because I gave you like the simplest possibly example of a component, it means I think it's all buttons.
[21:44:16] <pyzozord> ProfSimm: I'm not taking this as an insult, I think you might have mixed me up with someone else

[21:47:38] <ProfSimm> This is another example of how RoR is like 3-tier and not like MVC, by the way. In 3-tier, data talks to application, application talks to view. In MVC, controller talks to model, and MODEL TALKS TO VIEW
[21:47:39] <apotheon> ActiveRecord is not the model per se.

[22:35:20] <Decker> it's not an accessable property from JS
[22:35:23] <piou> pulse: I would recommend seing FP as a design decision more than a language one. If you learn a bit of FP you'll see that it probably relates well to many things you've encountered in procedural languages, and sometimes offer alternative solutions that have different properties, possibly preferable
[22:35:53] <piou> pulse: you can exploit most of FP strategies even in languages that aren't FP oriented
[22:35:58] <pyzozord> pulse: they appear to have th same interface as the rest of it, but the "body" might be implemented natively maybe? dunno
[22:36:01] <InPhase> pulse: There are some programs and problem domains where nearly the entire program fits very well into those patterns, and in those cases, using pure FP can provide some convenient structural and reasoning advantages.  So this is where there is a role for these languages.  The reason they do not have broader uptake is simply that there are also other problems to solve.

[22:38:30] <ProfSimm> GeDaMo: elsewhere?
[22:38:43] <pulse> ProfSimm, the interesting thing is that it approaches programming from a more math-y direction
[22:38:51] <ProfSimm> pulse: sure
[22:38:56] <pulse> traditional programming languages approach programming more from a practical standpoint
[22:39:00] <pyzozord> state can be mess at scale
[22:39:01] <GeDaMo> ProfSimm: the thing I'm talking about is the defining anonymous functions in the function call itself
[22:39:14] <ProfSimm> GeDaMo: see my example, they're inside the function
[22:39:14] <InPhase> pulse: State is actually disruptive to reason about when you can avoid it.  Even in programs with state you should strive to compartmentalize state and isolate access to it, so that routines behave as purely as possible.  But there are a lot of state-based problems, and thus you need some way to track gradually mutated state to address those reasonably.
[22:39:27] <pulse> pyzozord, state can be a HUGE mess in multithreaded scenarios
[22:39:34] <pulse> i mean debugging MT stuff is ... hats off
[22:39:40] <piou> I find that states are difficult whenever you deal with concurency... which is pretty much all the time since the program generally runs on a system with concurrent processes and lots of innocuous operations like reading a file can go wrong very fast and unexpectedly
[22:39:44] <pulse> i go crazy following the flow of a single thread sometimes
[22:39:56] <pulse> FP elegantly solves that by having no states, which is cool

[22:42:56] <InPhase> sonny: The whole point of OOP is that state is not easy to reason about, so you need to lock that stuff down into compartments with well-defined interfaces.  :)
[22:42:59] <pulse> no state would mean you can just foo_x(10000)

[22:43:16] <DPA> I kind of like the Symbol() concept JS has. It's usable instead of private, public, protected, but it's much more versatile.

[22:51:37] <sonny> ProfSimm it's not explicit at all, just look at Java packages
[22:52:18] <ProfSimm> sonny: java packages are not encapsulation, they're technically not hierarchical as well. The dot is, well, decorative
[22:52:27] <sonny> or the modifiers like private, public and protected
[22:52:57] <sonny> those all operate on a hiearchy
[22:52:59] <DPA> I think OOP making a class being both, a data structure, and a function interface, dumb & unnecessarily restrictive. There is no need to have such a thing as methods, and data structures don't necessarily have a 1:1 relation with interfaces.
[22:53:16] <sonny> yes I think it's a mistake too
[22:53:32] <sonny> but it's too late

[22:56:09] <sonny> yea, but I think he's talking about Java-like restrictions
[22:56:29] <sonny> so libraries end up using the static keyword a lot
[22:56:57] <sonny> and the dreaded can't use foo cause static senario
[22:57:13] <DPA> Often, functions take a bunch of objects. It's not unusual that more than one object are the actor, or that it's unclear which one should be the method.
[22:57:28] <DPA> *should have
[22:57:56] <sonny> I'm ok with operating on data, but I think the idea was that non programmers like objects or something?

[23:47:20] <pdc> KillerWasp what application are you using to see the file?
[23:47:44] <oldlaptop> Try opening up your vim in an xterm, and see what happens then.
[23:47:47] <KillerWasp> pdc: not really, much unicodes show from a hidden font even if you use dejavu, liberation or consolas.
[23:48:01] <GeDaMo> Yeah, a fallback font

[23:56:50] <oldlaptop> pdc: If all your GTK applications are rendering it the same way, I'd suspect that first.
[23:57:10] <oldlaptop> Unless you're talking about some GUI frontend to vim, vim doesn't necessarily have anything to do with how that codepoint is actually rendered.
