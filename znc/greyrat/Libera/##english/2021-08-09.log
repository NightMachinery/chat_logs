[02:12:19] <LjL> monarchy does tend to be vaguely sexist
[02:15:01] <dTal> no need to encourage it
[02:16:32] <dTal> what's the most awkward, problematic verb you could use? swapped? traded? flipped?
[02:16:34] <kurahaupo> Exa: "sealed a peace treaty by exchanging royal hostages"

[02:17:51] <kurahaupo> oh, in this context? "pimped"
[02:18:13] <Exa> I found another way to say it, saying both princesses "comes from" or "are born in" the other country
[02:18:34] <Exa> come from*
[02:18:41] <Exa> came?
[02:18:43] <LjL> "swinged". it's both awkward, and grammatically wrong!

[02:19:51] <dTal> unless both princesses slept with both princes at the same time I think "swinged" is semantically wrong too

[12:17:19] <twb> "dispatch" doesn't make sense there
[12:17:19] <blkshp> Might get a few looks though if you said either. It's not standard language here (England); I'd say, "Send the emails" or "Send the notifications" or even "Send the outbox mails/notifications", "Work the outbox"

[12:17:39] <twb> You would dispatch the messages in the outbox, but not the outbox itself
[12:18:01] <twb> It's prone to confusion with "despatch", though.  Best to avoid it entirely.
[12:18:01] * blkshp waves at the channel
[12:18:29] <twb> for email, I would probably just say "synchronize" or "go online"
[12:19:06] <twb> for an actual outbox... not sure.  "Summon the mail boy" or something?
[12:25:45] <alguien> twb, I have a NotificationOutbox which is basically a buffer for notifications, so perhaps a Synchronize() method is doubly appropriate

[19:32:09] <TechTest> though saying your English is "advanced" level does it necessarily imply you have  the C1 certificate?
[19:33:24] <StayHungry> depends on context
[19:33:48] <TechTest> on a CV for example
[19:34:45] <StayHungry> depends on employers
[19:35:58] <TechTest> implying I have a certificate even though I don't may be a good idea, who knows :P
[19:39:20] <StayHungry> solid certificate says it all
[19:40:54] <StayHungry> but it is unlikely to be needed when applying to a more modest company, where a confident language skill is a daily cornerstone necessity
[19:41:11] <pussipupu> Saying you have advanced English skills doesn't imply you have a qualification
[19:42:31] <TechTest> what if I'd say I have native - level English skills?
[19:42:59] <StayHungry> English (native), that's all
[19:43:53] <TechTest> well, English isn't my first language
[19:44:10] <StayHungry> then English (fluent)
[19:47:02] <TechTest> yeah, maybe something like this 
[19:52:29] <StayHungry> try to be clear above all. if there are no certification papers, then it is more appropriate to refrain from using comparison degrees from the academic environment.

[20:29:08] <TechTest> StayHungry: thank you, I guess "native level" would work
[20:29:18] <TechTest> even if I'm not native
[20:29:45] <StayHungry> deceptive to my taste, but tastes differ :)
[20:34:41] <TechTest> maybe :) 
[20:35:02] <StayHungry> because 'native' implies circumstances of origin and upbringing
[20:35:06] <TechTest> but the main language isn't English anyways
[20:37:48] <TechTest> I already mention Greek as my "first language", so I don't think there's as  misconception about that
[20:38:42] <StayHungry> 'native level' is 'native' but longer, whereas you mean 'native-like', which is usually indicated by the term 'fluent' https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/10006/how-should-i-indicate-language-proficiency-on-my-resume
[20:39:09] <StayHungry> Greek (native), English (fluent) is the way to go if you ask me
