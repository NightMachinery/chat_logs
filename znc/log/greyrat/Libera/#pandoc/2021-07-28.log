[15:08:09] <opDispatch> do most people still use the FreeNode room ? I see no activity here, while there used to be a bit on FN.

[16:56:00] <sm_> Hello
[16:56:21] <sm_> I need help with markdown conversion
[16:57:02] <sm_> I was trying to make a document in markdown which I wanted to later convert into a pdf with formatting
[16:57:20] <sm_> In my document, I wanted to have a vertical table
[16:57:54] <sm_> Where the headers are in rows and they are centered
[16:58:41] <sm_> The problem is that... I can't seem to do it with regular markdown syntax
[16:59:09] <sm_> And pandoc doesn't seem to convert it when I create the table with html
[16:59:34] <sm_> Is there anyway to do this?
[16:59:50] <sm_> Or is it a lost cause with pandoc

[17:51:44] <__monty__> Don't think any markdown converters allow much in the way of justification.
[17:52:14] <__monty__> With you could do with it with a custom filter.
[17:52:30] <__monty__> (I know they left, figured someone else might maybe benefit.)
