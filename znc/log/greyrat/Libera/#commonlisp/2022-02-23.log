[04:12:36] <mayuresh> good morning everyone. :)
[04:13:37] <mayuresh> i had asked this on the 'hug' mailing list, didn't get an appropriate response.
[04:14:13] <mayuresh> so asking here; is there any way to provide 'gnu' "readline" like functionlity using portable "common lisp"?
[04:15:22] <mayuresh> NotThatRPG: what do you mean by a "forms interface" to commands?
[04:19:46] *** Quits: patrice (~patrice@user/patrice) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:20:17] <NotThatRPG> In CLIM, one can have widgets that pop up to prompt for the arguments to a command. Given the alphabet soup of arguments to shell programs, it would be great to have something like that.
[04:21:27] <NotThatRPG> One could take the information that is in bash completion to begin to populate such an interface.
[04:21:36] <Xach> mayuresh: no.
[04:21:58] <Xach> mayuresh: terminal interaction at that level is not specified in common lisp.
[04:22:43] <NotThatRPG> I guess one could use CLIM, which is sorta portable, but at the cost of giving you a whole new terminal!
[04:23:04] *** Quits: _patrice (~patrice@50-248-121-94-static.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[04:23:20] <NotThatRPG> And CLIM requires a bunch of extensions that are outside of ANSI CL.
[04:23:27] <mayuresh> Xach: Thanks! :)
[04:23:36] <random-nick> yeah, it's portable vs standard CL
[04:24:01] <_death> I remember https://github.com/jasom/clinenoise though I've not tried it
[04:24:07] <mayuresh> NotThatRPG: That sounds very much like what A/UX did with their "Commando" tool.
[04:25:16] <jasom> _death: it should work for any sufficiently VT-220 like terminal; the history feature isn't super well tested though
[04:25:53] <NotThatRPG> _death: I don't really know what clinenoise is because it's got no readme...
[04:26:16] <NotThatRPG> oh, I see -- it's in response to the readline question, not mine
[04:27:17] <jasom> NotThatRPG: what do you mean no readme, it's totally got one that says "This is the stub README.txt for the "clinenoise" project."
[04:28:04] <NotThatRPG> jasom: Fair.
[04:28:06] <NotThatRPG> !
[04:28:21] <NotThatRPG> Then I read the asd file
[04:28:49] <NotThatRPG> I was hoping someone would say "oh, yeah, I've been working on a McCLIM terminal," but  alas...

[07:30:56] <mayuresh> beach: can you mould "second-climacs" to be usable without "clim"?
[07:31:24] <mayuresh> ofcourse, that would mean it can't be called "climacs". :)

[07:34:40] <mayuresh> okay.
[07:34:52] <beach> mayuresh: I am not interested in making Second Climacs an Emacs clone.  I want it to be an excellent editor for editing Common Lisp code.
[07:35:14] <beach> I think that requires a GUI library, and CLIM is a very good candidate.
[07:35:27] <mayuresh> beach: what led you to think I'm requesting that you make "Second-Climacs" an Emacs clone?

[07:35:45] <mayuresh> beach: Ah, okay, because I requested a GUI-less version!
[07:35:46] <beach> The fact that you want a terminal and not use a GUI library.
[07:36:29] <beach> A terminal is not the business of the editor, but it is for Emacs, because Unix can't really create a consistent set of tools with internal communication the way CLIM can with Common Lisp.

[07:39:16] <moon-child> not that I know of, but I stand by my statement
[07:39:20] <mayuresh> thanks to etimmons and parjanya, I got somewhat close, though not succeded yet.
[07:39:34] <beach> mayuresh: It really isn't usable at the moment.  And I am not working like that.  I still don't know how to compute correct indentation, so that's the main priority.  If you understand that my idea for Second Climacs is to be a Common Lisp editor, you will see that there is no point in working on other aspects until I have figured out indentation.

[07:43:04] <mayuresh> I understand that you want to have a Common Lisp focused/only editor component which would eventually be used by someone else to integrate with out McCLIM components to develop a Common Lisp IDE, right?
[07:43:11] <beach> Second Climacs is meant to be excellent for Common Lisp editing because it uses Eclector (which is a Common Lisp READer) to parse the buffer contents.  If I thought it would be enough to use existing techniques based on text, I would never have started the project.
[07:43:36] <parjanya> mayuresh: might I say respectfully, if you are having problems with asdf, you have more urgent problems than thinking about adjusting complex IDEs
[07:43:56] <mayuresh> parjanya: I agree wholeheartedly. :)

[07:45:11] <mayuresh> And yes, I don't know "anything" about Common Lisp. :)
[07:45:27] <mayuresh> I have only worked with AutoLISP.
[07:45:58] <mayuresh> And I got introduced to CS using Logo (thoroughly) which is a Lisp (though a lot of people tend to disagree).
[07:47:32] <beach> Not again!
[07:47:50] <parjanya> mayuresh: have you read Practical Common Lisp?
[07:48:18] <mayuresh> beach: I was just pulling your Dosa. :p
[07:48:21] <Guest7482> beach: if you tried to make it gui agnostic, do you have some sort of format for rich text that other gui environments could parse?
[07:48:55] <mayuresh> parjanya: Not yet. I'm working through Touretzky.
[07:51:36] <beach> Guest7482: What purpose would the rich text serve?  Again, the idea is to create something that is unbeatable for editing Common Lisp.  For that purpose, it takes Common Lisp source code and gives it to Eclector (which again is a Common Lisp READer).  It then transforms the text into some nested data structure.  Where would rich text fit in?

[07:52:44] <mayuresh> beach: I think Guest7482 is approaching it from the Microsoft environment side, where most code editors are actually "rich-text editors".
[07:53:11] <beach> I am sorry to hear that.
[07:53:51] <mayuresh> beach: both of my IDEs (for PalmPilot and Baan Tools development) extended the rich-text editor component provided with Microsoft's Foundation Classes included with Visual C++.
[07:55:31] <Guest7482> I don't know about microsoft.  I wondering about things like bold/italic/fonts etc.. Or if those are coupled directly with what's returned from eclector.
[07:56:08] <mayuresh> Guest7482: presentation is a different layer altogether. Isn't it?
[07:56:37] <Guest7482> it'd be a gui layer.
[07:57:05] <mayuresh> Guest7482: beach's work is "below" the GUI layer.
[07:57:49] <mayuresh> Guest7482: you could extend McCLIM to provide your visual elements as needed.
[07:57:54] <Guest7482> sigh, nevermind
[07:58:22] <Guest7482> In the future, please don't speak for others.
[07:58:34] <beach> I am not making myself clear here.  Font size, color, family etc. would be supplied by the module that analyzes the Common Lisp code, and these characteristics would be based on the role of the elements of the Common Lisp code, such as whether it is a lexical variable, a function name, a package name, etc.  But the result will then no longer be text, and instead consist of a tree of standard objects.
[07:58:51] <mayuresh> Guest7482: Sure, just tried to help you out of a ditch.
[07:59:27] <beach> mayuresh: CLIM already contains everything that is needed in terms of fonts.
[08:00:17] <mayuresh> beach: yes, I know. By extend, I meant, do whatever Guest7482 expects from "their" instance.

[11:02:01] <beach> hashfunc170a: Macros are no different from ordinary functions.  What works in an ordinary function works in a macro function as well.
[11:02:49] <beach> hashfunc170a: You can't have two separate objects like that in Common Lisp.  They are either bundled up in a list as you have, or they are multiple values.

[11:19:49] <phoe> hashfunc170a: a macro must return some Lisp code, which will most likely be a tree of conses
[11:20:09] <phoe> you can use cons- and list-making functions to create that tree, rather than quasiquote

[14:07:13] <phoe> pjb: I know it's standard macrology, but it isn't "obvious" macrology
[14:08:01] <pjb> It's obvious when you write the compiler and call the macroexpander.
[14:08:18] <phoe> it's not obvious if you are learning lisp and want to learn how macros work
[14:08:40] <phoe> people who are learning lisp do not usually write lisp compilers at the same time

[14:15:52] <phoe> point taken
[14:17:10] <jackdaniel> a natural language is relative; a person who learns macros doesn't need to know about this implementation detail (even if it is part of the standard)
[14:17:48] <jackdaniel> when someone wants to understand how macros are implemented, then we could say that they peek behind the abstraction scenes, so they /get their hands dirty/

[17:55:14] <Guest7482> Also did the double buffer one, but I think the general consensus is not to use it, especially for gl as it uses up your stereo views.

[18:21:03] <beach> I would still love to see a new CLX-like library that is more CLOS-y and that uses the Xrender extension exclusively for drawing.
[18:21:41] <Guest7482> if it's one of the output events, i think the output requests were putting out the wrong information.
[18:22:16] <beach> Then, maybe this time it should be a more abstract library so that different types of display servers can be used.

[19:11:04] <beach> NotThatRPG: There is stuff already in the McCLIM distribution, but I haven't looked at it lately.
[19:11:06] <jackdaniel> it doesn't cover everything, but it is a good start
[19:11:29] <NotThatRPG> What's the status of the emacs-style application stuff in McCLIM?
[19:11:37] <beach> random-nick: That's the lower level I was talking about.  But that's not how it is typically presented.
[19:11:49] <beach> ... pun not intended.
[19:12:20] <beach> NotThatRPG: ESA?  Still working but should be split up and restructured.
[19:12:38] <jackdaniel> random-nick: most toolkits rely on widgets+callbacks while clim defines a frame as a model and presentations and commands that have semantic meaning
[19:13:18] <NotThatRPG> The last time I tried McCLIM the graph layout stuff worked poorly, and argument parsing for complex arguments didn't work properly (trying to remember exactly what was wrong, but I think I had a command that required two arguments off the graphics, and it just didn't work at all).
[19:13:25] <NotThatRPG> But again, that was a LONG time ago.
[19:13:50] <beach> blacked: For an application to be highly scriptable, it needs a dynamic programming language.  I don't know Lua, so I can't say whether it would do the trick.  Some applications are written in a static programming language, and then scripting capabilities are added in the form of a dynamic language.
[19:14:10] <jackdaniel> either way, mcclim is useful for other things than writing applications - i.e you may use it to produce raster images, pdf and postscript documents etc
[19:14:14] <beach> blacked: But it is a much better idea to have the entire application written in one dynamic language.
[19:15:14] <blacked> i'm looking like i know elisp is not lisp or common lisp
[19:15:22] <blacked> but i heard this quote
[19:15:32] <blacked> Emacs Lisp is probably the most featureless language you can think of; it doesn't even do basic threading and the async stuff is a joke. All the major programming language modes are implemented as ad-hoc Elisp regexp parsers making bugs impossible to fix. Virtually _everything_ is implemented in Elisp, because the C code is a gigantic
[19:15:33] <blacked> unmaintainable mess. This means that all the pretty high-level stuff like Magit is shit slow. Good features take ages to propagate to upstream, whose reasons are often more political than technical.
[19:15:41] <blacked> `doesn't even do basic threading and the async stuff is a joke` , how is for common lisp?
[19:15:50] <phoe> CL has decent threading support
[19:16:16] * jackdaniel gets back to work
[19:16:20] <phoe> nothing truly good for asynchronous programming though, since it just doesn't fit the language model very well
[19:17:29] * jackdaniel hints at lparallel and lfarm

[19:19:42] <beach> blacked: It would have been better if Emacs were written in Common Lisp, as opposed to the way it is now written, but I understand Emacs Lisp is getting better and getting closer to Common Lisp in some respects.  Then, I don't much like how Lisp mode is implemented in Emacs, which is why I started Second Climacs.
[19:19:58] <blacked> yes there is one :)
[19:20:04] <blacked> but nobody use it :(
[19:20:19] <beach> Nobody uses what?
[19:20:28] <blacked> Climacs
[19:20:38] <beach> Hold on a sec...
[19:20:43] <blacked> beach can i use doom emacs in climacs?
[19:20:46] <jackdaniel> there is more than one - hemlock and climacs come to mind. hemlock if I understand correctly is used as an ide for ccl
[19:20:49] <_death> blacked: this quote is not up to date.. e.g., ELISP> (make-thread (lambda ())) => #<thread 0x565065b4e198>
[19:20:51] <_death>  
[19:20:57] <jackdaniel> (or the ide is build on top of hemlock)
[19:20:58] <NotThatRPG> blacked: elisp and emacs are a scandal for software engineering. Everything is done wrong according to SE dogma, but somehow it works better than most software that's done right.
[19:21:02] <random-nick> phoe: why doesn't it fit the language model?
[19:21:04] <NotThatRPG> FSVO "right"
[19:21:13] <beach> blacked: (First) Climacs is not that much better than Emacs, but I am talking about Second Climacs, which is not ready to use, which is why it is not used.
[19:21:55] <blacked> `talking about Second Climacs` oh ok , i'll move to it if it is ready, but what about my already configured config
[19:22:01] <Guest7482> notthatrpg: Which is why planning out software almost seems like a futile endeavour.  You never quite now why people will use things.
[19:22:13] <beach> blacked: It is not ready, as I said.
[19:22:36] <beach> blacked: And from your remarks, it sounds like you wouldn't want to be a user anyway.
[19:22:44] <NotThatRPG> Guest7482: Actually I was referring to things like namespacing, typing, heck, even lexical scope!
[19:23:05] <semz_> Was about to say, it's a bit weird to see "basic thread and async support" as a supposedly major shortcoming of elisp when there are so many much worse.
[19:23:11] <blacked> ummmm these language are slowly deteroiorating in the history, dont hate me but thats true.

[19:24:53] *** Joins: treflip (~user@user/treflip)
[19:25:06] <phoe> random-nick: well, less of a language model issue, but I do not know if any CL implementation supports that out of the box; there is stuff like cl-async which requires foreign code and structuring your code around its async model
[19:25:31] <phoe> but yeah, elisp discussion would be more suited to #lisp
[19:26:22] <Guest7482> it's certainly been an issue when trying to deal with events/eventing.
[19:29:07] <random-nick> don't other async programming models have you also structure your code around the async model? from what I understand, async models are still callback-based, but now with async/await syntactic sugar instead of explicit callbacks/CPS, not unlike cl-cont/green-threads
[19:33:16] *** Joins: poldy (~dbane@user/poldy)
[19:33:28] <random-nick> but yes, in order to do these things in CL you either need to rely on an entire foreign async framework like cl-async does, or you have to manually build your own while interfacing with the OS directly which would probably require implementation-specific code in order to keep things compatible with the implementation's implementation of files and streams
[19:34:05] <random-nick> unless you write your own using gray streams, I guess
[19:35:07] <Guest7482> there seems to be some time penalties going with gray streams.
[19:36:12] <_death> there are much better ways to support parallelism and concurrency anyway.. Lisp has a long history with such ways
[19:36:30] <NotThatRPG> I wish that the concurrency stuff from portable allegroserve had caught on: they are more lispy than many of the alternatives.
[19:36:39] <phoe> _death: could you say a bit more? I'm curious
[19:38:33] <_death> phoe: just think about the actor model (scheme ;), connection machine (starlisp), qlisp, etc.
[19:38:48] <phoe> oh, you mean these! yes, I see
[19:40:48] <_death> the CSP book also used a Lisp-alike
[19:41:18] <random-nick> also, does async offer any advantages compared to a "lightweight" threading model?
[19:44:56] <NotThatRPG> _death: "CSP book" or did you mean "CPS book"?
[19:46:12] <random-nick> csp would be communicating sequential processes? what would be cps?
[19:46:28] <phoe> continuation passing style I guess
[19:46:52] <Guest7482> I'm just wondering how to deal with events across different lisp processes.  You wouldn't want your event processor to execute callbacks in it's own process.
[19:47:35] <random-nick> why would you have different lisp processes in the first place?
