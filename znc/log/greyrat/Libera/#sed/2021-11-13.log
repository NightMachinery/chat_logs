[20:43:43] <Riviera> /foo/i\
[20:43:45] <Riviera> lalala
[20:45:54] <Riviera> One can understand the \ part of the command name. Syntax like /foo/ilalala comes from GNU sed.
[20:46:04] <lopid> why require a newline in the first place?
[20:46:07] <Riviera> Using i\lalala is actually rather fucktarded.
[20:48:09] <Riviera> lopid: I don't know why these decisions were made, if I had to guess I'd assume it's because of being ed-inspired (where you would hit enter before entering such lines),
[20:49:36] <Riviera> lopid: and because it's consistent with how multiple lines are entered in such contexts (using trailing backslashes (which however is different to ed, which uses a dot)),
[20:50:02] <Riviera> lopid: abd maybe because it eases parsing.
[20:50:18] <Riviera> lopid: but .. i'm pulling these out of my arse, been a while since i thought about such.
[20:50:21] <Riviera> :)
[20:51:32] <lopid> the ed thing might make sense (but also not :)). does typing the characters "\n" in ed insert a newline? i think not, but they do get substituted in sed…
[20:52:13] <Riviera> no, they don't
[20:52:20] <Riviera> that's GNU sed only.
[20:52:36] <Riviera> (or GNU and .. who knows, other ones, like busybox; but not classic / standard sed)
[20:53:25] <lopid> # printf %s\\n foo bar | sed --posix '/bar/i\one\ntwo'
[20:53:30] <shbot> lopid: foo
[20:53:31] <shbot> lopid: one
[20:53:31] <shbot> lopid: etc... ( http://ix.io/3ETu )
[20:54:09] <lopid> maybe it's only gnu "posix"
[20:55:15] <Riviera> There's no --posix in POSIX sed.
[20:55:36] <Riviera> Joking aside, it's how I said :p

[21:27:40] <Riviera> hehe
[21:27:59] <Riviera> well IMHO it'd not be a bad idea for some standard way to tell tools to behave according to the standard
