[02:01:48] <topcat001> If it gets scratched (which audio CD and DVDs are notorious for) or the metallic layer degrades (the latter has happened to me for some discs), it will not read.
[02:01:54] <SysGhost> MLC variants sure won't hold as long as SLC ones.
[02:01:57] <Earnest> 2 years apparently
[02:02:01] <Earnest> Before data loss starts
[02:02:39] <topcat001> However, unless the disc is physically dented/broken a specialised facilty can read the data back as the physical grooves/pits will still be there.
[02:02:42] <Earnest> SysGhost: When it comes to hdd vs. dvd, I mostly regard them as the same-ish.  hdds have a lot more to go wrong, but as you noted, sometimes burns are bad, too fast, etc
[02:02:49] <SysGhost> I kno that USB thumb drives are stupid as a backup media. I even had USB media fading bits on my very own desk.
[02:03:19] <Earnest> topcat001: The polycarbonate layer can be pretty badly scratched, so long as it can be polished back enough
[02:03:34] <topcat001> indeed
[02:03:44] <topcat001> but if the dye fades too much, it's gone

[02:04:05] <Earnest> topcat001: Yeah, dye is very important (as is metal used)
[02:04:16] <SysGhost> Earnest: There's another thing to consider. Something I learned with tape drives a while back: Drive units themselves can fail over time, and if they're out of life time, there's little to no chanse getting data back from media if one don't find a new drive used to take spare parts out of.

[02:04:41] <BrainDamage> exactly because they are dense that their data retention capability suffers
[02:04:48] <topcat001> in the past slower writing speeds seemed to last longer. I have ample empirical evidence of this.
[02:04:51] <Earnest> That's what I meant about hdd's having more to go wrong; the motors and electronics onboard, whereas that problem is sort of centralised to the dvd reader

[10:15:23] <cmtm> Hi folks, I'm trying to setup remote luks decryption over ssh by following these instructions: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Specialties#Remote_unlocking_of_the_root_(or_other)_partition 
[10:15:24] <phrik> Title: dm-crypt/Specialties - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[10:15:33] <cmtm> My HOOKS looks like this: HOOKS="base udev autodetect modconf block keyboard keymap consolefont netconf tinyssh encryptssh filesystems fsck"
[10:15:43] <cmtm> When trying to connect via ssh, I get an error saying "no route to host". This would lead me to believe that I've misconfigure the network connection, but what's strange is that if I add "break" to the linux commandline, I can enter the passphrase physically on my keyboard, causing the initramfs rescue shell to start. AT THIS POINT, I can ssh into the device from another machine, and it even asks for the disk decryption passphrase. 
[10:15:43] <cmtm> So it seems everything is configured correctly, but for some reason, I can't reach the machine while it's waiting on the keyboard input.
[10:15:53] <cmtm> Anyone know what's going on?

[10:19:08] <grawity> then maybe the problem is that it asks for luks passphrase *before* starting ssh?

[18:17:31] <Earnest> haskell as shared libraries was a mistake, and one that I even promoted.  You need so much automatic tooling to make haskell bearable
[18:18:18] <Earnest> I think using haskell outside of universities, like ocaml, was a dreadful mistake.  Even SPJ joking suggests he never wanted haskell to be popular, but he's right, it never should

[18:36:17] <AiO> neko2: the absolutely coolest thing about 2 weeks old new languages with their own ecosystem is that they will also be incompatible with them selves, so you need 13 installs of the same ecosystem matching each so called release :D

[18:36:53] <neko2> meh, if lisp is only "really" defined by that concept then who cares if it's a lisp
[18:37:01] <neko2> there's more to a language than lists
[18:37:02] <Earnest> And the nature of cons cells gave rise to cdr, car, etc. and a whole bunch of patterns that could merge data and code in specific ways that are unique to lisp (e.g. binder)

[23:51:00] <Foxboron> Neovim is pushing vim in the right direction 
[23:51:04] <Foxboron> What has Manjaro done?

[23:51:29] <jclsn> No idea. I just like their approach to kernel management. I never trust the first kernel release
[23:51:33] *** Joins: duxsco (~Thunderbi@user/duxsco)
[23:51:47] <Foxboron> Then don't make comparisons

[23:52:12] *** Joins: duxco (~Thunderbi@user/duxsco)
[23:52:20] <grtcdr> What is Manjaro's approach with kernel management?
[23:52:35] <Foxboron> Versioned kernels
[23:52:38] <jclsn> grtcdr: The kernel isn't updated by default with pacman
[23:52:40] *** Quits: duxco (~Thunderbi@user/duxsco) (Client Quit)
[23:52:44] <Foxboron> Which they forget and don't remove from the repos when they go EOL
[23:52:50] *** Joins: duxsco (~Thunderbi@user/duxsco)
[23:52:51] <Earnest> (And they don't backport)
[23:52:52] <Foxboron> jclsn: not really true
[23:52:52] *** Quits: Narrat (~omnius@p200300df5f13efa406ea56fffe2e7cdc.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Quit: They say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, but it's not one half so bad as a lot of ignorance.)
[23:53:08] <grtcdr> Why would they do that? I've never personally had any issues with kernel upgrades, and I do them pretty frequently too.
[23:53:10] <Foxboron> Earnest: they do pull experimental valve patches because Manjaro needs to look good on benchmarks..
[23:53:11] <jclsn> Foxborn: Why not`?
[23:53:15] <Earnest> grtcdr: theatre
[23:53:23] <Earnest> It's pure theatre
[23:53:46] <jclsn> grtcdr: I did occasionally
[23:54:04] <grtcdr> Were they catastrophic?
[23:54:04] <Earnest> This idea of, oh no the kernel might not work, is such bullshit.  Yes it may, and then use an older one, easy to do.  Holding back versions does nothing to stop this possibility
[23:54:18] <Foxboron> jclsn: because all their kernels provide linux but are versioned. They are dealt with by pacman. THey provide scripts so you don't have to think when you move between releases
[23:54:51] *** Joins: agvantibo (~agvantibo@79.165.99.155)
[23:54:59] <grtcdr> They should advise people to use two different kernels, LTS and Stable. And have their bootloader give them the option to pick between the two. This is the best approach. Don't hold back releases, you donuts.
[23:55:28] <grtcdr> How is their pamac (lmao) by the way?
[23:55:40] <Earnest> I just wish people would get over treating the kernel as special, needing entirely different methods of management than any other package
[23:55:46] <Earnest> This isn't going to happen though
[23:56:08] *** Joins: agregory (~agregory@98.47.65.14)
[23:56:15] <jclsn> Foxborn: All of this might be true, but still it isn't upgraded by default. You do it with their script and I usually upgrade after the 5th update or so. Haven't had any issues since. Might be a coincidence but well
[23:56:29] <grtcdr> I've had more problems with mpd, than with all my system packages combined.
[23:56:29] <jclsn> grtcdr: pamac is crap
[23:56:32] <Earnest> So instead of having a nice mechanism which works for every package, the kernel needs its own little set of tooling, it's own idiocyncrasities, it's own problems
[23:56:35] <jclsn> No idea why they came up with that

[23:57:21] <jclsn> Foxboron: I recently learned to touch type. Give me a break
[23:57:29] <grtcdr> It doesn't solve anything, since anybody using an Arch linux distribution should have the basic knowledge to open up a terminal and pacman -Ss through pacman's database.

[23:57:58] <grtcdr> jclsn: I can attest to that
[23:58:00] <Earnest> jclsn: tab is a key you can touch
[23:58:02] <Foxboron> jclsn: why does that matter when you can type "fox" and hit tab?
