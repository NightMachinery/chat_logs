[05:08:20] <d1rewolf> for example, I also use lua for hammerspoon

[05:12:34] <Bowuigi[m]> Since coq is a completion engine, it can use the native LSP or other kinds of sources
[05:12:45] <Bowuigi[m]> Namely, the buffer, paths, etc

[05:16:46] <Bowuigi[m]> They are not exactly the same
[05:16:58] <Bowuigi[m]> You can't use the Native LSP with CoC AFAIK

[12:36:47] <jakedevs[m]> it exists in popos you can unhide it with ctrl h but nvim folder isnt in there 
[12:36:53] <jakedevs[m]> i made one on my own with init.vim in it 
[12:36:58] <jakedevs[m]> would that work
[12:38:50] <irc_user> It should work, try it out.
[12:39:25] <jakedevs[m]> i did but there's nothing in the folder now even when i start vim and close it
[12:40:00] <irc_user> what do you mean nothing in the folder? didn't you just create `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`?

[12:41:33] <jakedevs[m]> oh
[12:41:44] <jakedevs[m]> i mean i thought it would generate a default config for me but i guess so
[12:42:33] <irc_user> It's been a long time since I installed nvim from scratch but I assume the default config is just whatever is default in neovim. If you want to customize it that goes in `init.vim`.

[13:26:12] <jakedevs[m]> hello when i remap keys in vim for example :nmap j <Left> the remap works but it doesnt go to my init.vim
[13:29:11] <irc_user> neovim doesn't automatically change the init.vim file for you, you have to go put `nmap j <Left>` in yourself
[13:29:29] <irc_user> But also I wouldn't recommend mapping j to left arrow personally.
[13:29:38] <jakedevs[m]> oh okay
[13:29:58] <jakedevs[m]> well im trying to do jkli
[13:29:59] <jakedevs[m]> kind of like wasd but for the right hand
[13:30:10] <jakedevs[m]> feel like it'd be more traditional
[13:31:11] <irc_user> You can of course do whatever you want, but I think since you're a beginner you should learn the default bindings first. Like the issue there is that `i` is the hotkey that puts you into insert mode. So you'd need to put that on a new key. But then that new key probably does something. And so on.

[13:32:25] <jakedevs[m]> i know, but i really dont like the default keymap and im willing to go out of my way to change it

[13:43:49] <irc_user> Since these are mappings for normal mode, you should use `nnoremap`, not `noremap`.
[13:44:47] <irc_user> and use `nnoremap` instead of `nmap` as well, because with `nmap` if you bind `<down>` to something `k` would invoke that too I believe.
[13:44:54] <irc_user> So just change all of it to `nnoremap` imo.

[14:50:46] <woodhardigan[m]> clason[m]: The problem I was also having is occasionally not loading properly when opening html or css files. I end up having to manually type ColorizerAttachToBuffer or ColorizerReloadToBuffer
[14:50:57] <woodhardigan[m]> Guess I would have to add it to my options...

[14:51:33] <sunjonSenghanBri> but that's not what bloated means?
[14:51:47] <sunjonSenghanBri> and "not loading properly" is not a great definition either
[14:52:32] <sunjonSenghanBri> if something happens, or doesn't happen based on file events, that's usually a problem that's not related to plugins
[14:52:55] <woodhardigan[m]> When something doesn't work properly out of the box, I also consider it a "bloat" ... 
[14:53:33] <woodhardigan[m]> Nah, I installed it alright. 
[14:54:37] <woodhardigan[m]> Any ways to get the termguicolors to display my colors properly? Usind my Xresources colorscheme ideally? Been also looking down that road
[14:56:05] <sunjonSenghanBri> I've no idea what "not properly" is
[14:57:22] <sunjonSenghanBri> googling "xresources colors neovim" has https://github.com/nekonako/xresources-nvim as the top result
[14:57:34] <sunjonSenghanBri> that'd probably be a good start to understanding what you need to do

[15:01:16] <sunjonSenghanBri> for what?
[15:01:25] <sunjonSenghanBri> turning 16 colors magically into a colorscheme?
[15:02:23] *** Joins: LordRishav (~LordRisha@user/lordrishav)
[15:03:40] <sunjonSenghanBri> that's not meant to sound as facetious as it did. I don't understand what your expectations are though
[15:04:22] <sunjonSenghanBri> terminal colors have an index. some colors in that index have a generally agreed value, ie. 1 == red
[15:04:51] <sunjonSenghanBri> terminal apps will now render with what you've set as red, when pointing to the 1 index
[15:06:01] <sunjonSenghanBri> vim colorschemes have hundreds of highlight groups, who or what makes those associations?

[15:09:46] <woodhardigan[m]> Yes, I understand that. The thing is, when I don't have termguicolors set I actually get the colors on neovim as expected, without needing colorschemes. I have 3 lines of settings on my options to optimize it and that's it.

[15:10:56] <clason[m]> OK, the _default_ colorscheme indeed works without `termguicolors` (very much by design)
[15:11:12] <clason[m]> but a colorizer never will, because it needs to be able to handle arbitrary colors

[15:17:18] <sunjonSenghanBri> bloated.
[15:18:22] <woodhardigan[m]> vim-css-color was king, despite not being written in lua 
[15:18:46] <sunjonSenghanBri> "yeah!"
[15:19:04] <bookworm> to be fair, not everything needs to be rewritten in lua... I just personally can't stand vimscript
[15:19:51] <bookworm> it's like bash vs python or any other sane language... bash works but doing anything but a simple pipeline is horrid
[15:20:02] <woodhardigan[m]> Only got into lua for LSP and cmp. Couldn't care less 
[15:20:10] <sunjonSenghanBri> that's a valid point in most cases
[15:20:26] <sunjonSenghanBri> but I think the approach norcalli took with colorizer was very deliberate
[15:20:26] <bfredl> if it works, it works. I'd switch to a newer alternative if it offers some new functionality I want, not just because it is a different lang. :]
[15:20:32] <clason[m]> Also, I don't see why vim-css-color should be broken -- the repo seems active, and not full of "neovim b0rken!!eleven!" rabble
[15:21:07] <sunjonSenghanBri> FFI processing of the colors values it going to be orders of magnitude faster than anything done in vimscript, on modern CSS files
[15:21:17] <woodhardigan[m]> bfredl: This. That's it. That's why I questioned colorizer. 
[15:21:31] <clason[m]> performance, and zero external dependencies.
[15:21:39] <clason[m]> those are pretty convincing arguments in my book
[15:21:52] <sunjonSenghanBri> this is why I questioned your observation of what the actual issue is and what your expectations are
[15:22:02] <clason[m]> (both of which are at least facilitated by using Lua)
[15:22:03] <bfredl> woodhardigan[m]: so? no one is forcing you to use colorizer if you don't want to :]
[15:22:07] <sunjonSenghanBri> you're critisizing things that are nothing to do with _your_ issue :]
[15:22:16] <sunjonSenghanBri>  you haven't even got it working
[15:22:27] <sunjonSenghanBri> and we're discussing its bloatedness and reason to exist
[15:22:54] <woodhardigan[m]> clason[m]: I looked a few weeks ago but really don't remember anymore. Will have to look again. But there was people on reddit talking about it too 
[15:23:05] <bfredl> any colorizer which uses 24-bit colors are gonna need termguicolors. old/new or vimscript/lua is irrelevant here
[15:23:11] <clason[m]> ah. reddit. that font of carefully verified facts
[15:23:14] <bfredl> s/are/is/
[15:23:34] <woodhardigan[m]> sunjonSenghanBri: I did installed it and got it working, that's also why I mentioned 
[15:24:28] <sunjonSenghanBri> yeah. I was looking how css-color did it; Unless it assumed that a range of the 255 colors was unused, and overwrote those for it's temporary highlights, I don't see how it works without termguicolors
[15:24:44] <sunjonSenghanBri> or how you'd know it was working, if your terminal isn't compiled with truecolor
[15:25:56] <woodhardigan[m]> Well, I never had termguicolors set and it just worked 
[15:26:24] <sunjonSenghanBri> you never had truecolor support period
[15:26:39] <clason[m]> I think it has a hardcoded set of terminal colors: https://github.com/ap/vim-css-color/blob/8bf943681f92c81a8cca19762a1ccec8bc29098a/autoload/css_color.vim#L94
[15:26:41] <sunjonSenghanBri> you've only ever been capable of displaying a preset palette of 256 colors
[15:26:44] <bfredl> so, presumingly it worked with the 255 color palette. which means it showed you an approximation, not the actual CSS color :]
[15:27:09] <clason[m]> bfredl: unless you're only using terminal colors in your CSS ;)
[15:27:34] <bfredl> clason[m]: gui browser considered bloated; return to lynx

[15:28:09] <bookworm> not cool anymore, the cool kids use gemini by now

[22:20:05] <woodhardigan[m]> Can someone please give me an insight here. Been trying to get lualine gruvbox theme to display the orange color on the fg when in normal mode. I've look into the github plugin page and LunarVim wiki as well. Both describe the same configuration which should be very straightforward. Still I'm getting the following error: `Theme 'custom_gruvbox' not found, falling back to 'auto'. Check if spelling is right.`

[22:50:32] <pun> run doesn't give an error, but the settings has no effect
[22:51:03] <pun> but the use case is documented in the readme on github  use { 'glacambre/firenvim', run = function() vim.fn['firenvim#install'](0) end }
