[03:05:00] <leftyfb> cluelessperson: why did you say "io errors" if you didn't see any io errors in logs?
[03:07:13] <cluelessperson> leftyfb, because it is some weird sort of io error that I click a file and it opens like 5 minutes later

[03:09:35] <cluelessperson> leftyfb, I'm suggesting the problem is in the logic of how this application loads data.

[03:14:06] <oerheks> yes, without proper info, a wild guess
[03:14:12] <jhutchins> My file manager hangs at startup when the Network Drives are either not mounted or have dropped off.
[03:14:25] <cbreak> yeah, but hanging is not an io error
[03:14:27] <jhutchins> It eventually comes up, but after a wait.
[03:14:32] <leftyfb> there's been no actual errors reported. Only a claim that the file manager isn't performing to their liking
[03:14:40] <cbreak> hangs aren't related to the issue here
[03:15:39] <jhutchins> cbreak: "Not responding" sounds like "hangs" to me.
[03:15:44] <cbreak> hangs could be caused by various reasons, either by being blocked in some syscall (because of a file system / os issue)
[03:15:56] <cbreak> or by some userland level deadlock / livelock

The thing is that i dont want to use yad because it has to be installed and i believe zenity was pre-installed in Ubuntu. Buuut.. im considering it now and im asking: what type of GUI building would you use? right now im googling python3 gui windows. but since i

[07:21:07] <snake> maybe the terminal for linux just offers generic colors with a wide range, and only the application can choose to not use stupid low-contrasting color combinations
[07:21:23] <snake> meaning i need to configure each program indivudally to use good colors

[08:15:40] <snake> ednash, what is that supposed to do
[08:15:53] <ednash> one liner to print all colors
[08:15:56] * snake rolls eyes
[08:16:02] <snake> are you even paying attention xD
[08:16:15] <ednash> i don't really care about your problem snake

[08:16:54] <ednash> anyway
[08:16:59] <rob0> and got trashed for it, yes
[08:17:02] <ednash> i rather like that one liner myself :)
[08:17:04] <snake> because the linux community has a real toxicity issue
[08:17:12] <rob0> and you are it
[08:17:15] <snake> it's like you're committed to misunderstanding people
[08:17:34] <snake> ednash, i dont want to print all rgb colors, i want to change the appearance of text on my screen
[08:17:50] <snake> i also found this site you guys could share if anyone has a similar problem: https://terminal.sexy/
[08:17:51] <ednash> go google search or something
[08:17:56] <ednash> it's an easy problem to solve
[08:18:04] <snake> thne you can export to the desired format easily
[08:18:13] <ednash> that one liner though
[08:18:13] <snake> ednash, its MUCH easier than above users were letting on
[08:18:17] <snake> they just wanted to debate

[08:20:45] <snake> that's fine by me
[08:20:49] <rob0> GIGO
[08:21:31] <ednash> it only works on zsh
[08:22:02] <snake> if someone comes in with a problem, it is preferrable to stay silent than to (OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE) start asking them if they like microsoft, and maybe they should just use windows
[08:22:22] <snake> and then send them three articles that miss the point entirely of what the issue is
[08:22:35] <rob0> I'm sure if there were ops available, you'd be banned.
[08:22:50] <ednash> zsh is one of those things i didn't know i needed until i just chanced upon it
[08:22:57] <snake> support receives a problem and provides a solutoion, otherwise just say you can't help, or say nothing, its fine
[08:23:13] <esv> hey folks, I am using 20.04, the about section says I am using X11 for the windowing system, just wondering, are you aware of  any plans to switch to wayland? not a fan of wayland but that seems to be the new flavor
[08:23:14] <snake> the information i came back and shared is THE solution to what i was asking
[08:24:02] <snake> rob0, yeah that's understandable, i am just so tired of taking crap from people that would rather hit enter 100 times to drown out my questions and responses
[08:24:15] <snake> so i lashed out, but it was against the CoC because i was mean
[08:24:53] <esv> also, is there a way to make terminal to copy the selected section automatically to the clipboard w/o having to type shift+ctrl-C?
[08:25:18] <snake> esv, 21.10 uses wayland
[08:25:27] <snake> kubuntu has a wayland option too but i didnt try it
[08:26:01] <esv> k, thnx
[08:26:05] <snake> that's pretty robust that you can switch to x11 or wayland at runtime
[08:26:15] <snake> impressive software development going on there
[08:26:39] <esv> yeah, but barrier does not seem to work well with wayland
[08:28:28] <snake> yeah idk what that even is, sorry bud
[08:28:59] <snake> in any case you can use x11 for the time being. i dont think its deprecated or anything

[21:05:01] <Dr-007> question. i want each button to be able to call a script supplying the selected list option in this GUI yad bash script: https://dpaste.com/AEBWLMPWJ it'll show you your partitions on sda1. my goal is to make the items moveable via the up / down buttons.
[21:05:30] <leftyfb> Dr-007: did you try asking in #bash?
[21:06:03] <Dr-007> it's pending
[21:06:09] <Dr-007> but yad is like zenity
[21:06:15] *** Joins: Guest88 (~Guest88@176.59.81.175)
[21:06:19] <Dr-007> and zenity is kinda ubuntu specific (i believe)
[21:06:35] <Dr-007> so that's why i'm also asking inhere
[21:07:10] <leftyfb> Dr-007: the functionality doesn't exist in yad or zenity so you need to script it with bash, or some other language like python
[21:07:12] <Dr-007> it's driving me nuts. ive been also exploring other GUI options. (preferrable pre-installed linux stuff like zenity)
[21:07:52] <oerheks> zenity is not preinstalled
[21:08:04] *** Joins: rulezzz (~rulezzz@187.204.142.191)
[21:08:27] <Dr-007> leftyfb, yeah thats what im walking into each time. it seems impossible. so thats why i started asking around. python, i believe it is preinstalled in Ubuntu (right @ oerheks?)
[21:08:46] <Dr-007> and. what GUI tool should i use then?

[21:09:54] <leftyfb> Dr-007:  without mentioning buttons, zenity, yad, scripting or code, what exactly is your end goal here?
[21:09:54] <Dr-007> so dont say c :P
[21:10:22] <leftyfb> Dr-007: put another way, with your perfection application, what is the use case?

[21:11:38] *** Quits: frmlof (~frmlof@70.243.238.191) (Client Quit)
[21:12:00] <Dr-007> well, the details im showing you now in https://dpaste.com/AEBWLMPWJ are targetted at moving the order of partitions around. i want this because ive been making bootable usb sticks and sometimes i end up with the fdisk warning "partitions are out of order". this can be fixed via sfdisk -r i believe but .. well, thats my end goal
[21:12:48] <leftyfb> Dr-007: so you want a tool to move partitions on flash drives around?
[21:13:12] *** Quits: EvilDMP (~textual@django/moderator/EvilDMP) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[21:13:32] <Dr-007> no i want a GUI environment where i can list stuff then change the order of the items in that list. something like zenity
[21:13:50] <leftyfb> Dr-007: why not focus on building them correctly to begin with? If the partitions are wrong, rebuild it correctly. You do understand that usb flash drives have a limited life span of writes and moving partitions around certainly doesn't help that

[21:19:49] <Dr-007> leftyfb, yes but then sfdisk -r, --reorder <dev> fix partitions order (by start offset) would fix my problem magically. but without the power of me adding stuff in the blank spaces if i delete a partition. fdisk will created a partition on an earlier sector but assign it a latter /dev/sdaXX id then give you the "disk out of order" bs. so my GUI tool should prevent this in the first place. these bootable USB's ive been making ive been collecting all the mount
[21:19:49] <Dr-007> stuff under scripts. this part ive arrived on and we're talking about now is the part where you gain some control over how and what partition is created. dont mind my lifespan of the USB.
