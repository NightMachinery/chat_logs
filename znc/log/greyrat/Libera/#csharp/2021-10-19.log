[11:56:40] <MatthiasVance> Yeah markdown is great
[11:56:44] <MatthiasVance> For documenting stuff next to code
[11:57:20] <Jck_true> And I'm trying to learn a little devops on the side. So I'm also building the app in Mono and running SonarQube static code analysis on it (Just for the hell of it)
[11:57:36] <Jck_true> And I just wondered what the preferred method was for documentation
[11:57:36] <MatthiasVance> Jck_true: Why are you using Mono over .NET 5?
[11:57:47] <Jck_true> MatthiasVance: Linux server.
[11:58:06] <MatthiasVance> haha, welcome to the future Jck_true, .NET has been on Linux for years
[11:58:36] <Jck_true> Oi :P I do embedded development :P
[11:58:57] <Jck_true> I was still star struck that I could do GUI stuff by just drag/drop
[11:59:06] <MatthiasVance> :D
[11:59:37] <Jck_true> Had a surprising amount of fun writing a little helper tool for my sports club
[11:59:55] <biberu> is mono still maintained? i still just see partial support for 7?
[11:59:58] <Jck_true> Anyway. So the conclusion is there isn't really an offical way of doing doc blocks?
[12:00:13] <biberu> Jck_true: xml comments
[12:00:19] <MatthiasVance> Jck_true: Yes XML doc
[12:00:21] <Jck_true> Okay :) Thanks
[12:00:21] <MatthiasVance> In code
[12:00:40] <MatthiasVance> (I thought we answered that before drifting off? maybe not :D)
[12:00:41] <biberu> Jck_true: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/
[12:00:50] <MatthiasVance> "+MatthiasVance> Otherwise, XML doc is fine"

[12:02:39] <Jck_true> I will... No reason. I distribute the binary from my development PC anyway. Can I build the windows executable on linux with .net 5 and distribute that?
[12:03:12] <Jck_true> Just to practice my devops :)

[12:35:04] <biberu> Jck_true: you probably created a project with one of the old framework templates
[12:35:37] <Jck_true> biberu: I'll look at it over the weekend :)
[12:36:43] <biberu> Jck_true: when you create a new project and pick e.g. a console application there are several templates, and one of them probably says .net framework in the description, usually you don't want that one
[12:37:19] <MatthiasVance> Fuuuck, fifth time scaffolding from DB

[12:46:25] <MatthiasVance> argh no EF Core 6 without .NET 6 of course, time to upgrade :)
[12:50:09] <MatthiasVance> wow
[12:50:12] <MatthiasVance> that was 2 whole minutes of work
[12:55:59] <MatthiasVance> I'm pleasantly surprised that it all Still Works (tm)
[13:00:46] <Miles8of9> you replaced dotnet 5 with 6 and it still compiles and works?
[13:02:00] <MatthiasVance> I replaced .NET Core 3.1 with .NET 6 and it still works
[13:05:13] <MatthiasVance> Miles8of9: So an even "bigger" step version wise :D
[13:06:59] <Miles8of9> i raplaced version 3.1 with 5 and got tons of errors to fix, i ended up copying files to a new solution and fix errors one by one... bc breaks!
[13:07:14] <Miles8of9> replaced
[13:08:39] <MatthiasVance> Ah what kind of things were breaking?
[13:10:10] <Miles8of9> calls to framework libs... it was an aspnet core project
[13:11:02] <MatthiasVance> Miles8of9: "framework libs" as in 4.x?
[13:11:51] <Miles8of9> dotnet core libs, like authentication, ef etc
[13:12:01] <MatthiasVance> ahh okay
[13:12:18] <MatthiasVance> Did you update the packages as well then?
[13:12:21] <MatthiasVance> Because I kept them at the same version
[13:13:08] <Miles8of9> ofc i updated everything
[13:13:17] <MatthiasVance> ahhh
[13:13:25] <MatthiasVance> Yeah I'm not doing that :D
[13:13:28] <MatthiasVance> Because *then* stuff will break
[13:18:55] <jbe> good to hear the upgrade path from 3.1 to 6 is less work than the 2.0 to 3.1 was at least
[13:28:09] <MatthiasVance> Well, as long as you don't upgrade anything other than the target framework heh
[13:28:25] <MatthiasVance> I'm assuming you also updated all packages when you went 2.0 -> 3.1?

[15:02:47] <bomb> thank you Suchiman THANK YOU
[15:03:28] <bpmedley> I was seriously considering the Macbook Pro 14 in and am thinking that I should wait until .Net and Windows 10/11 ARM64 are out of beta.
[15:03:59] <jamea> but my big dude is: how to send print directly to usb?  (i mean, "skip the print queue"
[15:04:24] <bomb> get the MBP so you can dev iOS too. that's a worthwhile skill
[15:04:59] <MatthiasVance> You can do that on Windows
[15:05:01] <MatthiasVance> Without a Mac
[15:05:01] <MatthiasVance> :D
[15:05:18] <bpmedley> bomb : True.  I think I should wait until Parallels and Windows ARM64 10 are out of beta.
[15:05:31] <bpmedley> MatthiasVance : Are you talking about developing or publishing?
[15:06:08] <bomb> no publishing without a Mac, that's for sure. but you can lease a Mac VM for that
[15:06:32] <bomb> or run a hackintosh VM in VirtualBox, etc.
[15:07:37] <jamea> other thing is: IEnumerable<dynamic> result = myConn.Query(qry);   <----- with this line only can execute sql commands: Select ? or can execute insert/update/delete ?
[15:08:14] <Suchiman> jamea: for queries not selecting any data, use Execute instead of Query
[15:08:38] <biberu> and don't use dynamic ><
[15:09:30] <MatthiasVance> bpmedley: Both
[15:09:42] <bpmedley> MatthiasVance : With or without a build host?
[15:09:52] <MatthiasVance> Developing without, publishing in App Center
[15:10:17] <jamea> biberu why not, sorry and escuse me
[15:10:31] <jamea> suchiman: IEnumerable<dynamic> myConn.Execute(qry);   ?
[15:10:42] <biberu> jamea: because you won't get any help from the compiler if you do
[15:11:08] <biberu> jamea: => very, very easy to make mistakes that don't appear until runtime, i.e. it'll crash in the face of a possibly paying user
[15:11:38] <Suchiman> jamea: no... check IntelliSense for the correct return type
[15:11:51] <biberu> => now you can't feed your cat and have to live on the streets
[15:11:54] <biberu> all because of dynamic!
[15:12:17] <MatthiasVance> bpmedley: ^
[15:12:36] <bpmedley> MatthiasVance : Nice!!  I was googling App Center.
[15:12:42] <MatthiasVance> :D
[15:12:55] <MatthiasVance> Downside is that you don't have a simulator, only an actual device
[15:13:17] *** Quits: Haxxa (~Haxxa@89nnjg0xckz9ggn6r5xm.ip6.superloop.com) (Quit: Haxxa flies away.)
[15:13:19] <jamea> ooo Suchiman: myConn.Execute(qry); right?
[15:13:21] <bpmedley> Just so I understand, App Center can present an actual device for testing?
[15:13:31] <jamea> testing....
[15:13:32] <biberu> jamea: you can just do var result = myConn.Query(qry), it's *less* typing and you maintain type safety
[15:13:39] <MatthiasVance> bpmedley: No, for development you have to use an iOS device, but you don't need a Mac
[15:13:48] <jamea> biberu thanks
[15:13:49] <MatthiasVance> bpmedley: And when you're done you can tell App Center to publish

[15:14:07] <MatthiasVance> no
[15:14:12] <MatthiasVance> the app is built on Windows, in VS
[15:14:29] <MatthiasVance> That's the "development" part

[15:51:07] <bynarie> Yea that needs to be cleaned up a bit.. Thank you for the input guys
[15:51:28] <bynarie> Its a messy pos i know lol, but it used to work and i modified something and for some reason it doesnt work now

[15:53:08] <bynarie> ok
[15:53:21] <bynarie> yes its a console only app
[15:54:34] <bynarie> I was just trying to keep the ugly unhandled errors from being displayed
[15:54:46] <jonp> but you *want* them to be displayed.
[15:54:49] <jonp> to know what broke
[15:55:06] <jonp> thus, you only want the try/catch if you want to *continue* once an error occurs

[19:14:53] <MizMahem> wanting to build WPF in Linux is kind of a weird ask if you can't actually run it there.

[19:15:58] <Diablo-D3> MizMahem: it was written for linux and osx before microsoft even owned xamarin
[19:16:09] <Diablo-D3> Ive used apps that use xamarin forms on linux when I still ran linux as my desktop os
[19:16:23] <Diablo-D3> its jank as shit, and not a great way to write a brand new ui, but it works
[19:17:07] <MizMahem> hmm, TIL.

[19:18:02] <Diablo-D3> no
[19:18:10] <Diablo-D3> remember, the dude that started xamarin is ex-gnome
[19:19:32] <Diablo-D3> the whole thing was a clusterfuck anyways

[19:59:18] <DevJohnC> my main gripe is that if you're using MAUI then you've decided to build a native app over a web app, but macOS support is through Catalyst and last I looked WPF was community supported? UWP restrictions suck dong

[20:06:46] <MizMahem> DevJohnC: that was my impression as well, so I didn't look further into it.
[20:07:32] <MizMahem> I mean, there is a place for MAUI maybe, but for people wanting to build desktop apps, I think a methodology like Avalonia is a much better fit.
[20:07:47] <bomb> I fell asleep and saw Java in my dream lol
[20:08:01] <Slade> hmm. i know they're changing cookie policies with the new tracking laws, so now my google/instagram ads are full of type 2 cookies.  https://crumblcookies.com/
[20:08:04] <MizMahem> having a common backend (model) between mobile and desktop is fine, but trying to cram the same UI abstraction for both mobile and desktop seems a bad idea.
[20:08:10] <bomb> another vote for Uno btw
[20:08:23] <bomb> MAUI is going to be crippled by design
[20:08:34] <Diablo-D3> yeah, maui *is* crippled
[20:08:47] <Diablo-D3> because it doesnt define what you think it does
[20:08:57] <Diablo-D3> it defines what all cross-platform uis must implement
[20:09:08] <Diablo-D3> each ui then *may* implement whatever the fuck they want
[20:09:23] <Diablo-D3> winui 3.x, for example, doesn't even require .net languages. wanna use c++? go ham.
[20:10:19] <MizMahem> I mean, water long under the bridge at this point, but I never understood why they decided to develop a new version of the WinUI, instead of continuing to iterate the one that exists.
[20:10:35] <Diablo-D3> because they are
[20:10:36] <MizMahem> Well, I guess I do know why, they wanted to unify desktop and mobile, but that was a collosal failure so... here we are.
[20:10:38] <Diablo-D3> they're doing both
[20:10:47] <MizMahem> right, riding two horses at once :p
[20:10:47] <Diablo-D3> its not a *new version"
[20:10:56] <Diablo-D3> not in the sense that winforms isnt wpf isnt winui isnt whatever
[20:10:59] <Diablo-D3> its two concurrent branches
[20:11:08] <Diablo-D3> thats A FUCKING STEP UP
[20:12:08] <MizMahem> well, I mean for a long time there the strategy was unclear, and the WPF route was treated as more "legacy" with WinUI 3 being the new hotness. It is only fairly recently they have pivoted to saying both will be supported going forward.
[20:13:16] <DevJohnC> they really need to maintain WPF, it's the most attractive platform from a developer standpoint because it doesn't come with it's own bullshit runtime or w/e like UWP
[20:13:48] <DevJohnC> what's the point of unifying .NET if your desktop apps still have to be written to target something other than the BCL?
[20:13:51] <bomb> just use JavaFX
[20:13:52] <Diablo-D3> MizMahem: they'll all be supported froever anyways
[20:14:02] <jonp> DevJohnC: what's the meaning of "come with its own bullshit runtime" though?
[20:14:06] <Diablo-D3> its that they're not *adding* platforms to old shit
[20:14:13] <jonp> especially in a .NET Core+ world in which apps *can* bundle their runtime?
[20:14:17] <Diablo-D3> and its really super easy to update most code thats xaml-based to new xaml-based
[20:14:32] <jonp> arguably *should*?
[20:14:47] <DevJohnC> jonp, my experience with UWP was that a ton of APIs are missing and replaced with new ones that better favor sandboxing or something, idk
[20:15:11] *** Joins: exvicesindaco (~exvicio@user/exvicesindaco)
[20:16:18] <DevJohnC> so if my app model is in a shared .net5 library, for example, and it does file IO or something using the BCL - that would run on xamarin.mac fine, even with the sandbox - but you try to run it on UWP and it's all about those missing APIs
[20:16:46] <MizMahem> well there is "supported" and there is "seeing active development." No doubt WinForms will be "supported" nigh-on forever, but I don't think any expects it to get new features or to be able to handle whatever the latest UI hotness is or whatever.
[20:17:06] <bomb> WPF is still the shit. Microsoft should just grow some and make WPF cross-platform
[20:17:17] <DevJohnC> and iirc the file IO apis were async only, which does make a certain kind of sense, but it SUCKS if you have any code that's not in an async call chain already
[20:17:23] <DevJohnC> and was rediculously over-complicated
[20:17:36] <jonp> wasn't that fallout from WinRT?
[20:17:36] <bomb> UWP is limited, as mentioned. MAUI has half-assed XAML support running on what, WinUI?
[20:17:46] <jonp> bomb: and iOS and Android
[20:18:13] <DevJohnC> targeting macOS using Catalyst is a mistake and feels so goddamned lazy

[20:18:31] <bomb> it's productive, declarative, loved by the community
[20:18:40] <bomb> WPF is the gold standard apparently
[20:18:59] <Diablo-D3> wpf is the most understood.
[20:19:03] <jonp> i suspect you're over-indexing on "XAML"
[20:19:07] <jonp> and not what XAML *is*
[20:19:11] <MizMahem> well I don't know about "proper" but again from my brief look the syntax is different enough to hurt, and often more verbose.
[20:19:18] <jonp> an XML-based object serialization structure
[20:19:21] <DevJohnC> XAML is just the markup language, which I actually don't like much
[20:19:28] <jonp> and if those objects don't exist on a given platform, you can't use them
[20:19:40] <DevJohnC> it's overly verbose and not the easiest thing to read with human eyes
[20:19:47] <jonp> easier than MSBuild?
[20:20:08] <bomb> now this attitude why we can't have nice things

[20:21:57] <MizMahem> XAML is pretty verbose, which is unfortunate. Again I've not done much more than glance at Xamarin but it's XAML appears even more verbose than WPFs. What I like about Avalonia is that it's dialect is pretty close to WPFs, but has some nice features that lets you simplify bits of it.

[20:27:53] <DevJohnC> despite not loving XAML, poor XAML support is the reason I don't use Eto.Forms much these days
[20:28:16] <Diablo-D3> it could use s-expressions, you'd just need an orthogonal way to namespace them
[20:28:25] <Diablo-D3> [12:53:40] <DevJohnC> yay, YAPS (Yet Another Path Syntax)
[20:28:30] <Diablo-D3> NT itself hilariously uses unix paths
[20:28:41] <Diablo-D3> its *only* broken ass legacy win32 stuff that doesnt
[20:28:48] <MizMahem> I mean, I don't think XML is necessarily the problem, per se. Yeah, it introduces some potential complexity in terms of things like namespaces and what not. But that complexity is also a solution to some problems.
[20:28:50] <DevJohnC> these days I put as much of the app model into a shared library and then build UIs for whatever platforms I need as close to native as I can (Xamarin.macOS and WPF w/ Stylet usually)
[20:29:49] <bomb> Eto still have a chance IMHO
[20:29:58] <MizMahem> But there wasn't any reason for the XAML selection techniques to be so ill-formed. Like, xPath exists, CSS exists. There were solutions at hand that could have been used.
[20:30:14] <Diablo-D3> xml isnt the problem the way microsoft uses it in xaml
[20:30:20] <Diablo-D3> it actually uses the entire xml toolset available
[20:30:21] <MizMahem> yeah
[20:30:22] <DevJohnC> Eto is my clear standout UI framework because it's the only one I know that does native UI
[20:30:29] <Diablo-D3> namespaces, schema enforcement, etc
[20:30:33] <Diablo-D3> if you dont use those, dont use xml
[20:33:02] <DevJohnC> it's fine, works ok, has flaws is all
[20:33:07] <DevJohnC> not sure what's better though
[20:33:25] <DevJohnC> like, I don't love HTML/CSS and I don't think anybody does :P
[20:33:44] <DevJohnC> or JSX
[20:33:45] <MizMahem> well, HTML would be the other go-to solution if you weren't going to use XML.
[20:33:47] *** Joins: kenanmarasli (~kenanmara@user/kenanmarasli)
[20:34:09] <MizMahem> the advantage would be its a widly known language. The disadvantage would be parsing it would be much more of a PITA.
[20:34:20] <MizMahem> so I understand why they went the XML route.
[20:35:02] <MizMahem> well the other advantage I guess would be that HTML comes with its own well developed selector language in CSS (and XPath I guess to).
[20:35:37] <MizMahem> though I think a variety of CSS could have been adapted for XAML, and I suppose XPath could have been used without changes.
[20:36:06] <DevJohnC> I think CSS is actually quite stellar, design wise
[20:36:26] <DevJohnC> succinct and simple syntax
[20:36:50] <MizMahem> I agree.
[20:38:46] <MizMahem> hmm, I'm far from an expert on how HTML or WPF (much less Xamarin) do layout, but I also think HTMLs layout approach may be different enough to cause some challenges there as well, I suppose.
[20:39:05] <MizMahem> (though obviously from a language perspective, you can define layout however you want, but I think HTML layout expectations are different)

[20:54:21] <MizMahem> on a completely different subject, is there a good LINQ-ish way to express like a recusive transform, or any existing methods that are good for doing so? Like a method that takes a value, transforms it against the first item in the list, and then uses the result of that value as the input for the second value?

[20:56:08] <Suchiman> MizMahem: i mean, it's LINQ, so there you go :P
[20:57:03] <MizMahem> hmm, well maybe I'll make a stab at doing it with Aggregate and see how it looks.
[20:57:55] <MizMahem> Actually, now that I think about it, aggregate isn't a terrible fit, except I guess I usually think of Aggregate in terms of return a singular value instead of a list of values, though that is absolutely not a requirement.
[20:58:06] <DevJohnC> I wonder if EF will get code generation like System.Text.Json
[20:58:42] *** Quits: Haxxa (~Haxxa@89nnjg0xckz9ggn6r5xm.ip6.superloop.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:59:43] <MizMahem> oh thats right, and because generating a new enumerable inside Aggregate can be messy :/
[20:59:59] <MizMahem> I think I've been down this road before, lol.
[21:02:01] <_genuser_> o/
[21:07:23] <MizMahem> yeah, every time I do something like this I basically end up doing something like making my own stackframe inside aggregate. Which I guess works but makes me think I'm kind of hammering a square peg into a round hole.
[21:12:51] <irwiss> DevJohnC: that'd probably be one of the best improvements ef could get, so you could get compiler errors instead of runtime when expression translation fails
[21:13:31] <DevJohnC> irwiss, for real that'd be amazing

I wonder if it is worth writing my own "Aggregate with a built in stack" operator, or perhaps this whole thing is just a bit wrong headed and I should throw it all in the bin. https://dotnetfiddle.net/1uGePr

[22:22:52] <ScottMichaud> Sorry for the follow-up from yesterday. If I have a target in a csproj file, and I set Outputs="C:\Dumps\cvextern.dll" on it. When I delete C:\Dumps\cvextern.dll, the build is still skipped. Running Visual Studio in diagnostic output doesn't even have my target name in it.
[22:23:17] <ScottMichaud> When I change a line in the C# file, then it happily copies cvextern.dll into C:\Dumps\cvextern.dll
[22:23:33] <ScottMichaud> It's like the Build target is not even being run or something???
[22:23:38] <MizMahem> hmm. I suppose the problem with building my own StackAggregate (Stackgrregate?) is that any method I pass it has to return to values...
[22:24:07] <MizMahem> or wait, does it? Hmm... no, I can constrain it to only returning a single value and appending that value to the result for it. Hmm...

[22:26:26] <MizMahem> ScottMichaud: right, I can and do (and did) do that. But I dun want to :p
[22:26:37] <ScottMichaud> In C# 9 (I think) it's just "new (first, second)" syntax.
[22:26:39] <ScottMichaud> Ah okay.
[22:28:55] <MizMahem> because from a "functional?" er... outside the "Aggregate" view what I want to do is take a method and apply it recursively to a given set of values along with some seed. That is, take the output from one call of the method and use that as the input of the next method.
[22:29:01] <Diablo-D3> auto tuplet con/decon
[22:30:09] <MizMahem> How this differs from a usual (or well, LINQ) Aggregate is that Aggregate is built with the assumption that result will be the final value in the chain. While what I want the result to be is all the intermediate results in the chain.
[22:30:24] <MizMahem> Which, I mean, I can still do with Aggregate, but it feels awkward.
[22:30:48] <MizMahem> to wit: https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/X5Re2YhL/DontTryThisAtHome.cs
[22:31:33] <chilversc> MizMahem: that sounds like fold left in other languages?
[22:32:11] <MizMahem> chilversc: possible. Thanks for the word, I'll google more. I am not a very good functionalcomputationlinquistologist :p
[22:35:51] <MizMahem> hmm, although thinking more what I want here is still two return values. In this case the quotient (which becomes part of the result) and the remainder, (which becomes the new seed/stack/whatever). Although `(double Remainder, double Quotient) Method(double value)` is still a cleaner signature than `(double Remainder, IEnumerable<double> Results) Method(double value)`
