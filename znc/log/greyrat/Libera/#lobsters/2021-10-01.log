[22:15:21] <jlindgren> when starting a language with your name doesn't work, make a library for another langauge that uses your name!
[22:15:32] <imode> what.
[22:16:34] <riv> i thin kthis poor guy has been raked enough
[22:16:36] <drobilla> Good grief it only gets worse and worse the more you look.  That's enough Internet for today I think
[22:16:37] <deadk> yte
[22:16:39] <deadk> -t
[22:18:25] <auri> as a self-appointed representative of the D community, I'd like to formally disown that person, if that is an option
[22:18:40] <imode> I'll do the same but for the i3 users community.
[22:19:00] *** Joins: jmw (~jmw@user/jmw)
[22:19:16] <imode> I like how his example of apparent DWM sins is "restart the process". news flash, you need to restart i3 if you alter the config as well.
[22:19:36] <companion_cube> tbh you can restart i3 without losing your windows
[22:19:39] <deadk> i agree with riv, at this point this is just stupidity porn
[22:19:40] <companion_cube> idk if dwm does it?
[22:20:11] <imode> I thought X owned your windows by default.
[22:20:19] <riv> you run dwm in a loop inside your xinitrc
[22:20:27] <riv> that lets your windows stay when you reboot dwm
[22:20:39] <companion_cube> hu
[22:20:42] <companion_cube> funny
[22:21:00] <imode> weird.
[22:22:49] <drobilla> bpwsm's approach of "there is IPC and only IPC" is the correct answer to this problem space IMO
[22:23:04] <drobilla> Configuration, key bindings, scripting/automation, all the same thing.  It's lovely
[22:23:10] <deadk> herbstluft does the same thing
[22:27:07] <technomancy> does "there is repl and only repl" count?
[22:27:27] <imode> which WM is that.
[22:28:01] <technomancy> exwm and awesome I guess?
[22:28:07] <technomancy> I was thinking broader than WMs
[22:28:46] <technomancy> I would also accept "there is smalltalk and only smalltalk" for varying values of "smalltalk"
[22:30:07] <imode> "there is repl and only repl" is an interesting idea.
[22:30:24] <technomancy> that's basically "emacs; the tldr"
[22:30:29] <technomancy> or smalltalk or lis pmachines
[22:30:30] <imode> means you'll need access to the frame buffer.
[22:31:01] <companion_cube> "there is LSP and only LSP"
[22:34:04] <cb> lumpy space princess???
[22:35:16] <shapr> that one, yeah

[23:23:37] <meff[m]> Lispy folks: What is the standard deploy flow like for CL and for Schemes? Do you end up getting executables with the Lisp image inside of it? And what's the startup time of these execs?
[23:23:49] *** Joins: pnoud (~pnoud@user/pnoud)
[23:23:58] <meff[m]> Asking about startup time mostly for writing scripts
[23:24:13] <meff[m]> But also curious from a long-lived app perspective
[23:25:40] <riv> the best way is to ship the whole compiler along with your program
[23:26:02] <companion_cube> there is no app, only REPL
[23:26:46] <cb> i just saw about that i3 vs. dwm post and WOW the title alone sounds spicy enough it shouldn't be posted
[23:27:36] <Church> Isn't everything in i3 just IPC too?
