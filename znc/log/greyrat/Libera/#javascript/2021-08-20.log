[04:22:14] <hassoon> shouldn't storing a dom element in a variable for later excessive use is better than calling it everytime with  Element.querySelector ? even if it's just reachable by doing Element.querySelector(<unique_class/id>) ?
[04:22:43] <hassoon> by excessive use i mean reusing it with every e.g mousemove event
[04:23:05] <sheetjs> depends if you modify the dom later
[04:23:51] <hassoon> sheetjs: nah the element is always there, i'm just going to do some dynamic resizing on it using some MouseEvent based logic
[04:24:38] <wroathe> hassoon: Yes, if it's the same element then you should keep a reference to it on hand
[04:24:50] <GreenJello> I usually find it clearer to define which elements I'm going to interact with in a single place
[04:24:56] <wroathe> hassoon: Otherwise you're just wasting CPU cycles to keep re-querying the DOM
[04:25:09] <GreenJello> whether that's a static lookup or a function that queries the DOM
[04:25:17] <hassoon> wroathe: ya makes sense
[04:25:57] <GreenJello> a single querySelector call isn't going to make a significant impacT
[04:26:56] <GreenJello> I wouldn't consider the performance cost until you have an observed issue
[04:27:00] <hassoon> GreenJello: nah the querySelector is going to be called with every mousemove event, so i'll opt with the variable approach
[04:27:16] <hassoon> * opt for *
[04:27:29] <c4017w> If I add an element to a div (where most elements are overflowed and not visible), it re-renders the entire div right?
[04:28:12] <c4017w> So I would be better off using windowing/virtualization to speed up adding new elements?
[04:28:14] <hassoon> what's overflowing and what's overflowed ?
[04:28:43] <c4017w> Like the div is a fixed height and it has overflow:hidden
[04:29:01] <GreenJello> hassoon, not sure it matters if you query a dozen elements in a mousemove event

[04:29:56] <GreenJello> but I come to the same preference for code quality reasons

[04:35:06] <wroathe> GreenJello: hassoon: Yeah, sorry, I shouldn't have confused the matter. Don't store a reference because you're worried about performance until you've measured. That said, it's often easier algorithmically to query one single time and re-use a reference than it is to re-query
[04:36:27] <wroathe> So the lazy programmer in me does it because it seems obvious to move an operation whose result can be reused out of the inner loop of the program, regardless of whether it would have a noticable performance impact or not.

[07:44:50] <ljharb> oh yeah you're right
[07:45:04] <ljharb> it's closer to right than before tho :-p
[07:45:43] <GreenJello> codebam, in your initial code all of the queries run in the background, so you at least need to deal with that or else you'll get out of order results and might not have all of the results when you try to use it
[07:46:29] <GreenJello> if you still end up using push at some point, that might be fine as long as things are sequenced correctly
[07:47:06] <GreenJello> it is hard to get consistent ordering with push, though
[07:47:18] <codebam> well right now it's working correctly as far as I can tell, but you're probably right. I'm trying to plan out how I want to refactor
[07:47:29] <codebam> because I'm calling this from another database query
[07:47:33] <codebam> in the then of that
[07:47:48] <codebam> https://paste.sbehan.ca/files/SOL.png
[07:47:59] <codebam> SOL, accurate haha
[07:48:34] <cis> "It should work but it doesn't" is frustrating, while "It shouldn't work but it does" is terrifying.
[07:51:33] <codebam> is it bad to be using so many await?
[07:52:38] <GreenJello> you might want it to make some of these queries concurrently, which a series of awaits prevents

[16:06:03] <carlino3> docs says that middleware can be used to perform authentication. i have wrote a middleware that receives a JWT from the client on the handshake object and validates it. if valid, retrieves the user info from database and attach it to the socket instance.
[16:06:08] <carlino3> https://socket.io/docs/v3/middlewares/
[16:07:22] <carlino3> this is working perfectly, but i need to send the user info back to the client also. is there a way to do it in the connection handshake (for example, send arbitrary data to the 'connection' event) or should i emit a custom event?

[22:23:31] <earendel> an object implementing an iterable interface could extend to methods to methods map,forEach,reduce. if it has iterable AND equable interface (implementing an isEqual predicate) could extend the methods contains, find, union, intersection, difference etc
[22:23:33] <austincheney> honestly, if you are concerned about some conventions that occur in other languages but are absent in JS and requisit upon classes you are really just trying to write your former language in JS syntax
[22:24:12] <systemfault> cloudbender: Google has literally spent, for the last 15+ years, truckloads of money on their JavaScript engine to optimize as much as possible
[22:24:19] <networker> i encounter quite a bit weird behavior but not so sure if someone has ever encountered ever before, so i was writing two console.log statements to test my two variables equality with "console.log(text,text.length,typeof text,beacon,beacon.length, typeof beacon);console.log(text==beacon);", and when i open it my console i see something like this "#        8 string #        8 string" and "false"
[22:24:34] <networker> lert's me paste it into a hatebin for better view
[22:25:25] <austincheney> cloudbender, what do you mean by optimizations?  For logic other than arithmetic JS is about half as fast as Java or about a quarter as fast as C++
[22:25:32] <networker> here https://hatebin.com/jeqgdtqiqe
[22:25:46] <networker> i did really expect a true there
[22:25:54] <cloudbender> sorry, it was a rather vague question
[22:26:08] <networker> was it for me ?
[22:26:40] <cloudbender> I want to run a performance test in the browser, and I was wondering if optimizations would mask my algorithms.
[22:26:44] <austincheney> where arithmetic is concerned JS is about 10x slower than Java/C++ because of memory inefficients around its single numeric type
[22:27:10] <cloudbender> ah. single numeric type
[22:27:37] <GreenJello> networker, const cps = (s) => Array.from(s).map(s => s.codePointAt(0))
[22:27:49] <austincheney> networker, instead of "==" try using "===" and console.log(typeof text+" "+typeof beacon)
[22:28:01] <GreenJello> try passing both strings to that and log the returned array
[22:28:03] <networker> i did try ===, still false
[22:28:21] <earendel> the extended methods could be returned in an object return by a Symbol representing the implemented interface .. so there would be no collisions

[22:33:49] <networker> i've never seen this one before tho, how strange
[22:34:08] <earendel> one question would be if an object has to implement two separate interfaces to extend to some methods. so maybe for that you would need to create a seperate interface, with an own synbol, which inherits/mixins other interfaces to be implemented. i think it could maybe be done without changing javascript at all even. with some extender method. at least at first as a proof of concept. what do you think? i may lay it down in some paper and
[22:34:08] <earendel> implement a proto
[22:34:16] <networker> var beacon="#"+" ".repeat(standardlen-1); also this is how i created beacon

[22:43:27] <earendel> carlino3 pardon ^
[22:43:56] <networker> GreenJello: also i did use .repeat method, does that count as generating non-breaking character ?
[22:44:14] <carlino3> earendel yes, that was my first idea. but what about fonts and audio?
[22:44:35] <carlino3> (fonts are defined as @font-face in CSS)
[22:44:44] <GreenJello> networker, it's just the name of the character. You can repeat any string you like
[22:45:11] <albertlast> carlino3: loading screen is the worst of world..
[22:45:27] <GreenJello> if you repeat a string that has one character that's the non-braking space, then you get multiple of those
[22:45:48] <GreenJello> if it's a normal space, then you get multiple normal spaces

[22:48:28] <earendel> are you serious?
[22:48:47] <albertlast> because loading screen block the user out of using the page/app
[22:49:33] <GreenJello> the loading indicator explicitly tells the user that they're waiting
[22:50:00] <GreenJello> if something takes a second to load, it's usually perceived as instant
[22:50:11] <earendel> i think in most cases you would want best accesibilty, so a page can be read even without styles. but in others.. like  for instance games, you want the assets to be loaded of course.
[22:50:26] <albertlast> users don't like to wait
[22:50:53] <albertlast> in games you got lod

[23:41:59] <carlino3> business in general,i guess
[23:42:24] <ljharb> Slade: a blank page of any color, yes
[23:42:31] <ljharb> austincheney: the kind that serves human beings
[23:42:38] <albertlast> i see this very common in sap stuff ther web stuff, always block the complet page unjtill everything is loading
[23:42:51] <albertlast> eaven the user will never see/use the stuff
[23:42:54] <ljharb> albertlast: nobody's saying "block the page" is good
[23:43:07] <ljharb> albertlast: all i'm saying is that humans objectively prefer a loading indicator to seeing a blank page
[23:43:09] <austincheney> ljharb, the rules differ pretty substantially for SAAS, ecommerce, and adtech
[23:43:22] <ljharb> austincheney: it's about human psychology, this does not differ for anything.
[23:43:55] <albertlast> show the page as soon as possible, when you got time to present a loading animation you had enough time to present something in the viewport of the user
[23:44:09] <ljharb> albertlast: that's ideal, but not necessarily true
[23:44:21] <austincheney> ljharb, in ecommerce if you aren't displaying ads the magic mix is actually, counter-intuitively, lower traffic at a higher conversion rate
[23:44:38] <ljharb> austincheney: i'm not sure how that sentence relates to "showing a loading indicator versus showing a completely blank page"
[23:44:53] <Slade> ljharb, oh. ok
[23:46:23] <albertlast> i can't image that the blank page stay the same time as a loading indicator
[23:46:55] <austincheney> ljharb, it really comes down whether the user should be forced to wait at all irrespective of how its communicated.  on a SAAS site a user will just patiently wait even without a spinner graphic
[23:46:58] <albertlast> since already the loading indicator need someting to be shown and this time you could already render the viewport stuff O.o
[23:47:05] <ljharb> albertlast: yes, and a loading indicator for twice the time is objectively preferred by people to a blank page
[23:47:15] <ljharb> albertlast: the delay isn't about rendering time, it's about making network requests
[23:47:41] <ljharb> austincheney: yes, i understand that some users are coerced to wait regardless, but their patience and enjoyment is still affected the same
[23:47:57] <ljharb> austincheney: that in some domains you can get away with a much shittier experience doesn't really matter unless you're trying to make a shitty experience
[23:48:05] <carlino3> the actual issue is not a blank page, but broken styles (e.g. an element with different fonts having different widths and altering the layout, etc). you notice the website "fixing" and it looks ugly
[23:48:31] <ljharb> also that
[23:48:36] <austincheney> ljharb, agreed, which is why I hate sites that are coded as a SPA when they are in fact not any kind of application at all (its just that the developers cannot write code without a pet framework)
[23:49:29] <albertlast> is the use of different fonts not the first issue, and the loading screen than a workaround for the mistake done before?
[23:50:11] <albertlast> get the fonts also pre loaded or dynamlical by the js self?

[23:57:13] <jellobot> dostoyevsky2, Avoid setInterval; use setTimeout instead. https://web.archive.org/web/20160602165800/https://zetafleet.com/blog/2010/04/why-i-consider-setinterval-to-be-harmful.html (requestAnimationFrame may be another alternative, see !raf)
[23:57:26] <ljharb> dostoyevsky2: also for something like that you probably want rAF anyways
[23:57:38] <anddam> howdy, I made a simple browser extension that hides a particular section of GMail (namely the Hangout gutter that is displayed by default since last year pandemic) by setting a few .style properties to DOM objects when the page loads
[23:57:43] <ljharb> dostoyevsky2: also you should try react, it'll rerender less stuff
[23:58:14] <anddam> a few actions in Gmail shows that section again, is there a hook I can use to call a function when a DOM object gets its stlye changed?
[23:58:33] <ljharb> anddam: you could try MutationObserver, but not really no
[23:58:43] <anddam> I ask that in order to not have a function idle periodically checking, I'd rather have it called only when need be

[23:59:20] <dostoyevsky2> ljharb: Actually I am just updating the text content of a div.  Showing the current time position in an Audio element.  I don't think react could do it more efficiently than me, as I already update just one property...  But I guess this then shouldn't show up as a high energy task
