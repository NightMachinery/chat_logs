[02:20:50] <Diablo-D3> the win10 taskbar code still exists in win11
[02:20:53] <Diablo-D3> *it didnt go anywhere*
[02:21:01] <Diablo-D3> it actually cant because of long term compat reasons!

[02:21:16] <Nasp> Yes i know it's still there
[02:21:21] <Diablo-D3> explorerpatcher just disables the new xaml taskbar and renables the old one!
[02:21:31] <Nasp> Why do you need an entire patcher for taht
[02:21:37] <Nasp> Can't you just do it through registry?
[02:21:39] <Diablo-D3> because you have to patch explorer.exe for it
[02:21:46] <Diablo-D3> the registry hack no longer works
[02:21:53] <Nasp> yay
[02:22:13] <Nasp> So with fixed you mean find something external to fix it :D
[02:22:15] <Diablo-D3> it does OTHER neat things too, but its all 100% patching stuff to re-enable or disable it
[02:22:33] <Diablo-D3> like, dont like the new explorer context menus? obviously the old ones still exist
[02:22:51] <Diablo-D3> its really super tiny because all it does is patch it
[02:22:58] <Nasp> The new explorer menus on top of the old explorer menus :D
[02:22:58] <Diablo-D3> it doesnt add anything to it
[02:23:01] <Diablo-D3> yup
[02:23:07] <Diablo-D3> all it does is just launch the old menu directly
[02:23:14] <Diablo-D3> it can swap out the alt-tab as well
[02:23:21] <Nasp> It's like someone got told to just quickly make a new UI
[02:23:21] <Diablo-D3> want the old win2k one? its still here.
[02:23:31] <Nasp> "We need a win 11 now, we have no new features,  just change some UI please"
[02:24:25] <Diablo-D3> the only thing the patcher DOES add thats new... is his attempt at making a classic looking alt-tab, but with the modern features
[02:24:44] <Diablo-D3> all configurable though
[02:24:44] <Nasp> I saw somene making a completely new taskbar instead

[12:01:49] <tsujp> So the `JsonPatchDocument<T>` takes a T and allows the properties of T to be targeted by the JSON patch itself, that I get
[12:02:30] <tsujp> Then we make a new instance of Customer and try and apply the patch document to it
[12:03:01] <tsujp> But I am fetching a pre-existing entity, and attempting to edit things on that entity instead and it doesn't like that because I allow T properties to be set but I am fetching N type entity, understand?

[12:03:23] <tsujp> Unless you use AutoMapper?

[15:59:40] <xb0o2> Check what you're actually counting the characters of ;-)
[16:00:21] <cerl> It's 'int counting' causing the issues isn't it? I've tried it as char before, but the csc compiler gives me an error.
[16:00:54] <xb0o2> Nope - go through your code with a fine tooth comb - you'll spot the mistake.
[16:02:08] <cerl> Oh my. I think I know what I did wrong. It's putting the file PATH in the string, not the contents of the file.
[16:02:58] <xb0o2> Bingo.
[16:04:19] <Nasp> Should enums be json serialized as strings or ints?
[16:04:27] <Nasp> Or should that be something you can decide for the specific usecase
[16:05:24] <cerl> There we go. I fixed it. It's reading the contents of the file rather than putting the file path as the string. Thank you xb0o2.

[16:29:29] <jmer> Nasp: I don't remember the details I just liked how OpenAPI handles enums
[16:29:42] <Nasp> Well that's the documentation about it
[16:29:52] <Nasp> More like do you want to send and receive enums as strings or ints
[16:29:59] <irwiss> if "optimizing" enums into integers is a concern it shouldn't be json to begin with imo
[16:30:09] <Nasp> Not optimizing
[16:30:11] <Nasp> Just what do you prefer
[16:30:19] <Nasp> I feel like the safest way us to use strings
[16:30:33] <Nasp> Since at some point you just know somebody is going to sort enums in alphabetical order
[16:30:42] <Nasp> But if it's enum flags then it should be ints
[16:30:43] <jmer> using strings is a lot less magical than just sending numbers and hoping the consumer read the docs correctly... :P
[16:31:19] <irwiss> it's not about preference, the moment you put them as integers is the moment json loses human readability, in which case, why are you using json?
[16:31:48] <jmer> irwiss: that's a pretty good argument imho
[16:31:55] <Nasp> Yes it's more readable
[16:31:59] <Nasp> Isn't that a preference as well
[16:32:13] <jmer> I guess in that perspective quality code is a preference as well
[16:32:22] <Nasp> Also  i hate enums :D
[16:32:54] <jmer> I don't really hate them but I haven't seen a fit for them very often.
[16:33:06] <Nasp> Well i dont hate them, i hate how they are abused
[16:33:10] <jmer> hahahhaa
[16:33:21] <jmer> Nasp:  in that case I 100% agree with you
[16:33:21] <Nasp> I've seen people do stuff like EnumObjectType
[16:33:26] <jmer> ...
[16:33:28] <Nasp> So you need to  check the enum to find out what the type you are working with
[16:33:30] <Nasp> And stuff like that
[16:33:36] <Nasp> Or making waaaay to many decisions based on enums
[16:33:36] <jmer> because let's add our own typesystem on top of the built in one xD
[16:34:07] <Nasp> Like in one specific example we had an enum, and then 4 dictionaries where you could look up information based on that enum
[16:34:11] <Nasp> How about just using a class then :D

[20:50:59] <wroathe> Without needing to still implement the properties
[20:55:04] <Suchiman> wroathe: so the args that are filled into the object are read from the command line?
[20:55:35] <wroathe> Suchiman: From a variety of sources potentially
[20:55:44] <wroathe> Suchiman: It's meant to be a class library that is agnostic to the kind of application using it
[20:56:00] <wroathe> So it could be a console application, or a web application, or a powershell cmdlet that calls these routines
[20:56:25] <wroathe> And so these are args objects that I want the consumer to be able to provide an "override" for the working directory for
[20:56:40] <wroathe> The default value of WorkingDir for these objects is Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()
[20:56:41] <Suchiman> wroathe: ah... that will make my idea of just normalizing when populating the properties fall flat
[20:57:07] <wroathe> But in the case of powershell it'll be whatever the cmdlet's path is (which is different from the process working directory)
[21:04:15] <wroathe> Maybe the way to do it is to make my own "global" working directory variable as part of one of my static classes
[21:04:28] <wroathe> Windows.WorkingDir = "c:\whatever"
[21:04:39] <wroathe> And then access that from my FilePath abstraction with it's implicit conversions
[21:05:34] <wroathe> Hrm, but the problem with then with that is it pins me into only having one working directory at a time for all of the routines
[21:05:57] <wroathe> Which is how Directory.GetCurrentDirectory behaves anyway
[21:06:01] <wroathe> But still, it's annoying
