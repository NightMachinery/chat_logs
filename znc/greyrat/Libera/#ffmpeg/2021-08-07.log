[13:27:22] <GuiToris> to see what's going on otherwise I don't know when to stop the recording
[13:27:55] <GuiToris> I'm thinking of picture and sound

[19:03:28] <MoC> Hi, this is more of an signal processing question but when resampling one can effectively choose between filters that either have a clean-ish frequency response or exhibit very little rippling. Are there any general guidelines as to when one wants to use either of them? I am currently leaning towards aliasing filters when upsampling and rippling filters when downsampling as I'd rather have aliasing in probably inaudible frequencies than rippling in potentially audible
[19:03:29] <MoC> frequencies but I am not sure if such considerations make any sense or if it's more related to what I am going to do to the signal after upsampling.
