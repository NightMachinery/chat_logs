[04:21:36] <Voidwarper> there is a bug with qutebrowser. if you go to libera.chat main website, on the top navbar on the dropdown buttons you can see two right or down arrows
[04:22:07] <Voidwarper> while from the source code there is only one in a ::before element from the button title
[04:22:34] <Voidwarper> The-Compiler
[04:28:54] <emanuele6> Voidwarper: qutebrowser would not cause the problem, qutebrowser just uses qtwebengine to render html pages and all that
[04:29:34] <emanuele6> either way, i just tried that page on another chromium browser and it has the same issue
[04:30:04] <emanuele6> probably a bug in libera.chat's css
[04:30:41] <ktprograms> Same in WebKit (Safari)
[04:30:44] <Voidwarper> emanuele6 inspecting their source code, it seems to be as it should be
[04:31:03] <Voidwarper> i opened the webpage in chrome and it works well (one arrow not duplicates_

[04:38:13] <Voidwarper> ktprograms yes pseudoelements must be broken in qtwebengine
[04:38:31] <emanuele6> either way, if their css and html is correct and there really is a renderer bug in the page, the bug would be upstream in qtwebengine or chromium (or another similar dependency), not be in qutebrowser.
[04:38:34] <ktprograms> Voidwarper: This is happening for me on WebKit (Safari)
[04:39:14] <Voidwarper> i tested with a portable version of chrome i have and it looks good, also they same told me the liberachat mods when i asked in their channel why their site is broken
[04:39:32] <emanuele6> then they are probably using non portable CSS as i said
[04:39:45] <Voidwarper> ktprograms safari i think uses blink now
[04:39:58] <Voidwarper> they moved to the google engine
[04:40:25] <emanuele6> it is weird since Voidwarper said that it displays correctly in google chrome
[04:40:44] <emanuele6> i can only get it to display correctly on firefox (but i have not tried google chrome)
[04:41:03] <Voidwarper> maybe chromium pushes beta builds
[04:41:26] <ktprograms> According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine), it isn't being used by Safari
[04:41:27] <Voidwarper> google chrome stable, is better tested probably
[04:42:45] <emanuele6> safari doesn't use blink, it uses webkit
