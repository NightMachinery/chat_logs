[05:07:24] <companion_cube> people keep talking about homelabs
[05:07:30] <companion_cube> are these like their main desktop machine?
[05:09:47] <anirudhan> I think its different for different people.  For me, its a bunch of raspberry pi clusters that I run my services on.  The question I have is wrt to storage.  I want to have a system by which I can mount block storage to my VMs similar to how we do in AWS EBS.
[05:11:33] <companion_cube> the common part is that it's at home, right? :p

[05:16:29] <companion_cube> I think I have an opposite need: a kind of short lived instance in the cloud, with big computing abilities, for just a few hours
[05:16:45] <companion_cube> the problem is that if you make a VM image it seems that most of the time you pay for it even when it's down :/
[05:16:51] <companion_cube> at least on EC2 and DO, I think

[18:05:30] <manicennui> x86 Chrome is definitely noticeably slower on an M1 than aarm64 Chrome.
[18:07:11] <ignaloidas> surprise, emulation isn't as fast as native :P
[18:07:47] <ignaloidas> I would wonder though, how wasm performs though in M1 vs some comparable x86 machine
[18:08:23] <ignaloidas> because "middlecode" is an interesting concept that could prove powerful going into the future

[18:14:50] <manicennui> Google doesn't seem to be able to detect CPU type for Macs, so it just suggests the x86 build by default, and I didn't look at it closely the first time I installed.
[18:15:15] <manicennui> I only realized my mistake when it had to install Rosetta before running.
[18:20:53] <manicennui> I figured I'd fix it later, but I noticed that some things were pretty slow.
[18:27:38] <EdwardIII> manicennui: what kind of thing are you doing on your m1? dev?
[18:27:48] <manicennui> Yes.
[18:28:44] <EdwardIII> manicennui: which langs?
[18:28:54] <EdwardIII> i'm interested if it's ready for prime time
[18:29:17] <manicennui> It is, but it doesn't matter in my case, because most of my development is done on another machine that I SSH into.
[18:29:59] <EdwardIII> ah ha ok
[18:30:21] <manicennui> But I can't imagine that you'd have a problem unless you are doing something low level perhaps.

[18:31:16] <manicennui> Some key piece of software you use not working well under Rosetta or not being ported I imagine.
[18:31:27] <EdwardIII> iDrougge: lack of native support for runtimes/toolings, running them slowly under rosetta and making me unhappy
[18:32:06] <manicennui> Nothing I do relies on binaries either though.
[18:32:15] <companion_cube> seems like docker is a bit hit-or-miss on M1
[18:32:21] <manicennui> So unless it won't compile on aarm, it shouldn't be a problem.
[18:32:28] <manicennui> Docker is a shitshow on the Mac in general.
[18:32:36] <manicennui> Since it has to run under a VM.
[18:32:38] <EdwardIII> currently i have a 2019 mbp and frankly it sucks for my workload. CPU reguarly gets up to 80/90C, becomes barely useable due to throttling, then from time to time bluescreens for consistently running at 100C which the CPU is not rated for
