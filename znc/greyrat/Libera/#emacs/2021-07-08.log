[02:49:11] <darth-cheney> Is rcirc just not able to show messages/nicks in columns?
[02:49:42] <aindilis> aidalgol, noted - yeah he'd be making a sacrifice, but the good news is I've written a lot of custom modes for languages we both use, and we need a web editor - can Emacs be hosted online somehow?
[02:50:15] <aindilis> for other people to edit data that we incorporate into the AGI
[02:50:33] <aidalgol> No, but there has been at least one attempt at emulating Emacs in a web browser: ,,ymacs

[10:23:25] <wasamasa> wgreenhouse: I don't think you specifically broke it, but it has been like that since yesterday
[10:25:10] <kenran> What would be the standard way to add "format on save" functionality, but with a specific function for each specific mode?

[10:27:28] <wasamasa> that function could for example dispatch on the major mode
[10:27:47] <wasamasa> or better, it would use indirection by looking at a buffer-local variable for the formatting function to use
[10:27:58] <wasamasa> and you'd set that buffer-local variable via your major mode hook
[10:28:25] <wasamasa> or you could improve the former with a multimethod/generic function

[10:28:45] <kenran> wasamasa: thanks, lots to look up :) but it's something on my TODO list for quite a while and it looks like there's a lot to learn/pick up as well!
[10:28:49] <wasamasa> the fallacy is believing that there is a standard way
[10:29:00] <wasamasa> no, there's not, this is a text editor made of lots of hacks
[10:29:33] <kenran> wasamasa: ah yes, I saw that with "popups", or in general windows that "pop up". how they're named, how they can be closed etc.

[13:53:52] <hmw> I plot histograms of the grades of my students with matplotlib. The raw data is stored in Org tables, the Python script is a code block. Works OK, but if you don't use matplotlib too often, there is a bit of fiddling involved to make it do what you want it to do.
[13:55:37] <empwilli_> ack, everytime i want to plot sth. i end up with not doing so because the hurdles even for simple things are high... but the same holts true for gnuplot so that's that :D
[13:57:01] <hmw> That's true. But I think the results of matplotlib can be very eyepleasing.
[13:57:14] <empwilli_> indeed
[13:57:41] <hmw> Esp. if one uses seaborn
[13:57:53] <empwilli_> so that's no argument against matplotlib, i think plotting things is inherently complex and has a ton of nops to fiddle with

[18:00:38] <rpav> doom's level limitations lead to better levels than most games without
[18:00:50] <rpav> also doom64 is on steam and 1000% worth it

[18:01:59] <rpav> hodapp: yeah .. i don't see a lot of that anymore sadly
[18:02:26] <rpav> levels these days are much more "streamlined ride from A to B, don't let the player get lost etc"
[18:02:42] <rpav> whereas i spent hours exploring doom levels to find all the things
[18:02:47] <yates_work> i thought it was because there was a PAGER set in my bash config, but if i "unset PAGER" in an xterm, then start emacs from that shell, it stil happens
[18:03:02] <AlKatori> Depends on the type of game. As I'm older I find I like the streamlined A to B more
[18:03:10] <AlKatori> of course I'm playing rimworld right now so who knows
[18:03:11] <rpav> and i spent awhile exploring the first couple doom64 levels too .. i think that one has some good stuff
[18:03:19] <hodapp> see, one thing I liked in Blood is how there were parts of levels that were very clearly made for people who were cheating (e.g. using weapons cheats and then blowing up every single thing they could find to blow up)

[18:37:29] <bremner> I switched from irssi to circe years ago because of "uncanny valley" text editing: it's a bit like emacs but not really.

[19:23:32] <wasamasa> it's considered good style to extract magic numbers and such into constants
[19:23:44] <xheimlich> yes. But you don't have a magic number there.
[19:23:51] <xheimlich> you have default options!

[23:32:05] <bpalmer> I'd be suspicious of anything like 'QueryFoo', though; to me, that suggests it's a function call of possibly arbitrary complexity, up to and including internal RPCs
[23:32:07] <contrapunctus> rpav: Doesn't the IDE tell you it's const? 🤔️
[23:32:16] <rpav> natter: next to things like `#define ture true` so those typos don't slow me down!
[23:32:34] <contrapunctus> (I haven't used C++ since the early '00s)
[23:32:37] <bpalmer> you should #define ture false   because it's not true.
[23:32:44] <bremner> compile your C++ with a PHP compiler for less annoying errors
[23:32:51] <lampilelo> rpav: lol that's a good one
[23:32:51] <contrapunctus> lol
[23:33:00] <bpalmer> less annoying or fewer annoying errors?
[23:33:06] <rpav> contrapunctus: well the point is more looking at a list of APIs to determine what they do, rather htan looking at a list of APIs then secondary information
[23:33:20] <rpav> like in lisp there's often set- or in scheme there's !
[23:33:20] <bremner> bpalmer: excellent question, evil twin
[23:33:26] <bpalmer> rudybot: I'm sure mutation can be exposed in the UML diagrams.
[23:33:53] <rudybot> bpalmer: isn't UML that ridiculous manglement-speak fad for drawing inaccurate diagrams of systems that don't actually exist after the reas thing has been released?
[23:34:03] <rpav> bpalmer: haha ture/false
[23:34:44] <ix> rpav: wtb hungarian notation?
[23:35:04] <rpav> hungarian is like .. poortyping
[23:35:20] <ix> I dont like hungarian notation for anything except namespace disambiguation
[23:35:32] <rpav> though i guess you could consider `const` part of the type, but ehh
[23:35:40] <ix> But the information *is* there, so what you want is isomorphic
[23:35:58] <rpav> well you first have to convince everyone to use it specifically for that
[23:36:15] <ix> rudybot: lol, true
[23:36:16] <rudybot> ix: lol that's so true
[23:36:26] <ix> Hey, jinx.
[23:36:27] <rpav> which i guess is easier than time travel to make culture changes to early C++
[23:36:46] <bpalmer> of all the things to use time travel for ...
[23:36:53] <ix> :D
[23:36:56] <rpav> or convince everyone to use something else / make something better / ...
[23:37:30] <ix> I miss C++. My latest project is C so i have object-oriented pains
[23:37:42] <solidus-river> yeah this seems really complicated, i jsut dont want to use escape or meta as modifiers and it seems emacs doesn't support this
[23:37:53] <bpalmer> hmm. I might enjoy a story about a time traveller with really specific desires. "Yes, yes, I'll get around to dealing with WWII some day. But first, I need to stop a mathematician from getting in a duel..."
[23:37:56] <solidus-river> really seems like a basic feature to rebind keys, very confusing
[23:38:43] <ix> solidus-river: maybe look at evil, it does some seriously fucked up things to emacs's input filter
[23:38:46] <rpav> bpalmer: or maybe a time traveler who's looking for the smallest thing with the largest positive future impact because you only get one shot
[23:38:57] <rpav> though surely that's been done, and isn't as funny
[23:39:19] <ix> bpalmer: who, btw? Is that pythagoras? I cant remember
[23:39:40] <ix> No, maybe euler?
[23:39:43] <bpalmer> I was thinking Galois.
[23:39:47] <ix> Galois!
