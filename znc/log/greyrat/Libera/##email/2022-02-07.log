[10:18:54] <pj> That's a massive range, though, they seem to have most of 56.0.0.0/8
[10:21:27] <pj> That said, USPS.com designates 56.0.0.0/16 as their mail server range, according to their SPF record, so any of that which falls outside of that probably should be on the PBL.
[10:27:21] <jimpop> (can't sleep, on mobile...)
[10:27:57] <jimpop> 56.0.143.18 is the sending IP which matches the SPF
[10:29:47] <jimpop> here's the RCVD_IN_ZEN_LASTEXTERNAL line:

[10:44:13] <pj> Why did you ask about 56.207.40.123, then?
[10:44:29] <pj> oh, nm
[10:45:01] <pj> the sending IP is 56.207.40.123, which is not 56.0.143.18 and also does not match the SPF record.
[10:46:09] <pj> so where did you get 56.0.143.18 from?
[10:46:54] <pj> oh, that recieved header is not yours
[10:47:28] <pj> so then where is the log entry or header showing the message arriving to you?
[10:48:32] <pj> gk-c18-email.usps.gov resolves to 56.0.143.18 but that's meaningless.  All of that info is coming from the sending server and is untrusted.
[10:58:08] <jimpop> here's my received header:
[10:58:11] <jimpop> Received: from gk-c18-email.usps.gov (gk-c18-email.usps.gov [56.0.143.18])(using TLSv1.2 with cipher ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 (256/256 bits))(Client CN "gk-c-mail.srvs.usps.gov", Issuer "Sectigo RSA Organization Validation Secure Server CA" (verified OK))by mx2.domainmail.net (Postfix) with ESMTPS id 4JrWLx58vGz3r66for <JIM@K4VQC.COM>; Sat,  5 Feb 2022 12:05:29 +0000 (UTC)
[10:59:56] <jimpop> to me, that should be the last trusted IP used by Spamassassin
[11:01:20] <jimpop> but it's clearly not, as 56.207.40.123 is in the PBL/ZEN and 56.0.143.18 isn't

[15:46:26] <solsTiCe> hi. I don't know much about email and stuff. I mail daily "subscriptions" to people (around 200) that specifically ask for it. I have setup dmarc in DNS record to increase reputation (?). the other day, I have added a rua=mailto:... and now I receive daily report from google on that email address. why is that ? I did not ask for that. On a subdomain, I have a forum hosted on google app engine. but that's all, beside using analytics
[15:47:40] <solsTiCe> I don't even plan to make anyhting from that dmarc email address because p=none in the _dmarc record
[15:47:45] <Khepra> solsTiCe: "I have added a rua[...]"   that's asking for it :)
[15:48:05] <solsTiCe> ok. I will remove it then. any explantion though ?
[15:48:10] <Khepra> don't have rua or ruf if you don't want the reports
[15:48:20] <Khepra> https://dmarcian.com/rua-vs-ruf/
[15:49:34] <solsTiCe> I was using google as my MX but not anymore
[16:39:08] <solsTiCe> I just read I is recommended to use a SPF 'v=spf1 -all' if the server does not send email. I just created a subdomain Mx for Inbound Parse Webhook on sendgrid. So I want that, right ?
[16:50:28] <jimpop> 7
[16:50:46] <jimpop> (opps)
[16:51:15] <solsTiCe> ah ah. we know your password now ! ok .sorry
[16:52:00] <jimpop> lol, yes short passwds are easier to manage
[17:03:20] <tykling> solsTiCe: you are getting the report because someone is delivering mail from your domain to google, and you have the record in place. if google were to receive no email from your domain for 24 hours they would have nothing to send a report about
[17:04:23] <solsTiCe> yes. I have finally understood that. so only google send those dmar reports. because I receive nothing from outlook, yahoo, ...
[17:04:41] <tykling> maybe you are not sending to those providers
[17:06:05] <tykling> I know yahoo sends out reports because I receive from them
[17:06:45] <tykling> also fastmail, xs4all, aol, verizon, comcast, mail.ru - just from a quick scan of my mailbox
[17:07:13] <tykling> but it all depends on who you (or spammers impersonating your domain) sends email to of course
[17:12:12] <Khepra> solsTiCe: "I just read I is recommended to use a SPF 'v=spf1 -all' if the server does not send email"    ...  not the server, but domain. the spf records are for domains.
[17:12:36] <Khepra> and yeah, having SPF records even for (sub)domains that never send is better than not having SPF records.
[17:13:26] <solsTiCe> well, yahoo servers are deferring my emails. reason: 'Email was deferred due to the following reason(s): [IPs were throttled by recipient server]'. I have added a simple sleep when sending emails. But that still fails like that. I am increasing the sleep to 5 minutes for yahoo email; Is that ever be ok ?
[17:14:01] <solsTiCe> Khepra: ok
[17:18:12] <Khepra> the "throttling" messages from yahoo is total misdirection. you'd get that if you sent one email per day, if yahoo servers have you blacklisted for whatever reason
[17:20:03] <solsTiCe> yes/ ok
