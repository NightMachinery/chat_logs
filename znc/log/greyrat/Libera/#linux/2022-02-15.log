[06:58:50] <mlu> and there's plenty of languages more consistent than PHP :P
[06:59:02] <tpanarch1st> blame whmcs for writing that in php ha
[06:59:31] <mlu> phpMyAdmin is a janky toy to admin a database with
[06:59:41] <F8ER> Indeed, PHP is very tricky one, and is not recommended for new developers since it's relatively easy to open a security hole.
[06:59:45] <tpanarch1st> server admin's using cloud linux with jailed shell so I can't update the php max vars is what it boils down to

[07:00:06] <matsaman> F8ER: oh steam uses it do they? La-dee-dah =P
[07:00:13] <mlu> in my experience, a new developer can always easily open a security hole whatever language they use
[07:00:24] <mlu> PHP makes it fairly easy only beacuse it's fairly easy to do anything
[07:00:28] <F8ER> Yes. Steam is Nginx and C++ mostly. Looks like MySQL too.
[07:00:36] <matsaman> no, PHP makes it easy because it has zero security accountability
[07:00:39] <mlu> but what I've found is: opening a security hole is about as difficult as getting stuff working at all
[07:00:41] <matsaman> and it was never even designed
[07:00:47] <matsaman> and people keep rewriting it

[09:36:06] <DOSfan> alkisg: maybe it is better as a swap file cause I could adjust it's size easier if everything was in one ext4 partition.
[09:36:11] <alkisg> You can also use a swap file as they told you in #ubuntu, and grow the ext4 to gain that 1 GB
[09:36:43] <alkisg> A swap partition helps in live cds and in hibernation; a swap file can be resized more easily, but you shouldn't have to resize it in normal use
[09:37:09] <alkisg> If you expect resizing a 1 GB swap to save you from out of space issues, you're doing something wrong
[09:37:33] <alkisg> Also, if your disk is SSD and you don't have enough % of disk free, you're wearing it out
[09:37:46] <alkisg> SSD disks are supposed to have enough free space to work properly
[09:37:59] <DOSfan> alkisg: Ok that makes more sense, I'll make a swap file instead.  What about this disk cache size .. that's one I am trying to figure out how to size it.  Is there a seperate file for setting 'disk cache' size?

[09:48:05] <kaf> (alkisg) SSD disks are supposed to have enough free space to work properly
[09:48:32] <kaf> isn't it required for all type of storage disks ?
[09:49:01] <alkisg> No, writing the same sectors in HDDs isn't as big an issue as in SSDs

[09:49:32] <kaf> how much empty space good for a 128 gb sdd to work properly ?
[09:50:27] <alkisg> I don't have numbers off-hand, you'd need to google for numbers. I'd leave 20% of free space in each partition.
[09:50:47] <kaf> 20% of free space fair enough
[09:50:58] <kaf> (alkisg) No, writing the same sectors in HDDs isn't as big an issue as in SSDs
[09:50:59] <kaf> cheers

[12:19:47] <Lemniscate> The only time you ever really see these with something like Debian or Ubuntu is when you're trying to build something that has dependencies that conflict with what's already installed or is in repos.

[12:21:30] <Lemniscate> Sounds to me like you might like buiding strange stuff in a VM.
[12:21:45] <Lemniscate> That way, if it goes BOOM, you still have a usable install.

In this way it is possible to have applications compiled against different versions of libfoo installed on the same system."

[15:26:55] <EtherMan> Hey so, I'm a bit perplexed atm because I can't seem to get cront to run my python script :/   I have a script that says */5 * * * * /bin/bash -l -c "/usr/bin/python3 /home/root/main.py"  but it never runs. Running the script manually works with no issues, but with crontab, nothing. If I add a > /tmp/pyscript.log at the end, then it writes the file upon execution, but there's no output whatsoever. Anyone have any ideas what could be wrong?

[19:18:55] <mort> huh curious, curl prints connection refused but no syscall returns ECONNREFUSED
[19:19:00] <kurahaupo> For "how many file descriptors does this process have open", the simplest way is just to count them as you go. Or open a new one, whereupon it will give you the lowest available number
[19:19:17] <ayecee> jensen: i'm going to go with no.

[19:19:37] <absentia> you can list a process' open file descriptors through `/proc/$PID/fd`

[19:20:03] <ayecee> they serve different purposes.

[22:17:32] <kj7rrv> Wouldn't they have to compromise a repository first?
[22:17:42] <Psi-Jack> kj7rrv: Or your DNS. 🙂

[22:54:32] <ayecee> sybariten: by activating the universe repo and installing it with apt.
[22:54:38] <Gustavo6046> hexnewbie, what if it's a maglev pendulum?

[22:57:45] *** Joins: falk689 (~falk689-q@gateway/tor-sasl/falk689)
[22:58:15] <Gustavo6046> anyway, with a maglev pendulum, maybe have the magnetic field somehow react to a pendulum's slight changes in movement, and providing some pushback from anything other than the pendulum's trajectory? it would be kind of like a flywheel or an inductor
[22:58:21] <ayecee> but maybe you've got some ideas you want to try out first.
[22:58:29] <hexnewbie> Gustavo6046: You can remove the people if you're feeling extra merciful, I was thinking the axial rotation (angular momentum), and the entirety of the iron core
[22:58:43] <Gustavo6046> ahh
[22:58:53] <Gustavo6046> when I said magnetism I was referring to the maglev mechanism, but now I realize what you mean
[22:58:58] <Gustavo6046> so the magnetic field of the Earth itself could interfere?
[22:59:05] <Gustavo6046> you think it could be calibrated for?
[22:59:22] <catbeard> i unlocked super maglev upgrade in dyson sphere program a while ago
