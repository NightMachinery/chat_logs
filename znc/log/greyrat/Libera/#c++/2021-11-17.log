[02:01:18] <CppCon> aliases won't show up during moving
[02:01:30] <CppCon> unless you have very shitty code
[02:02:06] <Alipha> yeah, with references and pointers and such, you could inadvertently do a self move. but since the stdlib doesn't protect against it, i wouldn't bother protecting against it
[02:02:06] <CppCon> IMO, std:move() is considered a coding smell (most casts are)
[02:02:48] <imMute> O.o  even the situations where it's required to not get a copy?
[02:02:49] <Alipha> um... apparently CppCon likes to do unnecessary copies
[02:02:53] <CppCon> nope
[02:02:59] <CppCon> I like to do this: consume(func())
[02:03:04] <CppCon> did you get it?
[02:03:58] <imMute> how do you do that in the initialization list of a ctor?\
[02:04:14] <CppCon> that is the only place it doesn't smell : - )
[02:04:16] <jkaye> std::move is a smell, lol
[02:04:41] <imMute> mmkay.  let me just refactor all my code to be 100% functional.
[02:04:42] <jkaye> Not sure the understanding is complete on that one
[02:05:00] <CppCon> but std::move(localvar) or std::move(data_member) or even std::move(global_var) smell A LOT (in order of smelling, left to right)
[02:05:00] <jkaye> And by not sure, I mean I'm sure the understanding is not complete to say something like that
[02:05:02] <Alipha> if you're a fan of functional programming, yeah, i guess you can avoid std::move...

[05:49:51] <bpalmer> there are non-standard ways of doing this, but one way that uses just a little bit of non-standard tools is to have a tool that turns a file containing "It was the best of times; it was the worst of times..." into a .h with something like #define TEXT "R(It was the best of times... )"

[14:46:02] <rond_> I have a class A. I want to create a named tuple inside A for the sake of readability (to return this named tuple instead of just a tuple or std::pair). However, if I define a struct inside A, then I do not have access to A's fields. IS there a clear way to achieve this without passing the reference to the object?

[15:14:07] <TinoDidriksen> rond_, this is not Java. Sub-classes are actually just classes - they don't have an implicit connection to the parent object, because they aren't part of the parent object. They are separate types that just happen to share some knowledge.
[15:14:28] <TinoDidriksen> So if you want to access, pass in the object whose member you want to access.
[15:15:45] <rond_> that''s what I thought. thanks!

[15:25:32] <rond_> My IDE warns me that my ctor does not initialize fields. However, I have something like this: struct A { struct B { int a; int b; }; B left; B right; A(int u) { ...computationsForSomeVals... left = {someVal1, someVal2}; right = {someVal3, someVal4};};
[15:25:38] <rond_> should it be done any better?
[15:26:28] <TinoDidriksen> Those are technically assignments, not initialization. Just add = 0; to the int members.
[15:26:50] *** Joins: pingpongball (~pingpongb@43.228.192.108)
[15:27:43] <rond_> TinoDidriksen I don't like it because it gives a hint to the reader that somehow "0" is a default value - when it's not.
[15:28:35] <TinoDidriksen> It shouldn't really warn unless you're reading from the variables before the first assignment.
[15:29:53] <rond_> maybe CLion isn't catching up

[17:50:08] <King_DuckZ> is that string doing something dodgy that confuses the stdlib, or did I run into a broken is_standard_layout implementation, or am I misunderstanding what should be a standard layout?
[17:50:42] <TinoDidriksen> The latter.
[17:50:52] <TinoDidriksen> Standard layout does not mean trivially copyable.

[22:16:53] <Guest34> But what about static class member variables like this `struct test { static int a;}`, is `a` 0 or it doesn't even exist as it has to be defined somewhere outside the class?
[22:18:16] <bpalmer> right; that's just a declaration, but you need a definition as well.
[22:20:01] <Guest34> the `0` initialization does not apply to uninitialized static member variables unless they are defined outside like this `int test:a;` then it's 0 initialzed.
