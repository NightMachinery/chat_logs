[00:00:04] <clever> i got it directly from the broadcom site
[00:00:11] <craigt> clever: disgruntled employee, somebody left their password on a sticky note attached to their monitor. So many options.
[00:00:16] <clever> and it was part of the original header release for the v3d porting contest on the rpi1
[00:00:16] <craigt> clever: oh
[00:00:36] <craigt> clever: Then I would ask broadcom for clarification.
[00:00:56] <clever> basically, the rpi soc is a collection of at least 5 cpu clusters, including arm, vpu, and the 3d core
[00:01:14] <clever> and the 3d stack was all done on the vpu, in a codebase RPF cant release
[00:01:35] *** Quits: fling (~fling@user/fling) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[00:01:37] <clever> but, there was a different chip, that was 3d only, and the 3d stack for android was done properly in linux on the arm core
[00:01:44] <clever> using the same 3d core
[00:01:52] <clever> and broadcom was able to release that driver
[00:02:17] *** Joins: fling (~fling@user/fling)
[00:02:19] <clever> so basically, they released the driver for the "wrong" chip, and told the community to race and see who fixes it first

[00:06:52] <clever> https://github.com/phire/hackdriver is a proof of concept somebody made, entirely in userland, just poking at /dev/mem
[00:07:02] <clever> i believe originally, it just rendered a single triangle using fragment shaders

[00:07:40] <clever> https://github.com/cleverca22/gl
[00:08:14] <clever> craigt: i was also crazy enough to try and re-implement opengl from scratch, rather then fixing the original driver, and got far enough to render a simple 2d scene
[00:08:17] <clever> before i then realized, i dont know how opengl works :P
[00:08:46] <clever> i have since ported that example to baremetal: https://github.com/librerpi/lk-overlay/blob/master/platform/bcm28xx/v3d/v3d.c

[02:36:28] <Jastiv> Pretty sure that it is not a correct usage of LGPL.  You can always distribute binaries if you distribute source.   (on the other hand, the developer does not have to distribute binaries and can choose to distribute only source.
[02:38:53] <Jastiv> (I've actually seen some developers do this, where you have to pay for binaries, but can download the free software source gratis. ) (althought there is nothing preventing you from redistributing binaries, people don't bother)

[02:40:21] <junebug> Jastiv, there is a closed source binary required to even build the application. The source doesn't compile or run without the proprietary binary
[02:41:15] <Jastiv> I'm pretty sure you could take the LGPL component and replace the closed source binarry piece, compile and run it that way, and redistribute the binarries.  Code is not require to compile.
[02:41:17] <junebug> Seems like a dark pattern to me. But the questions is does LGPL allow for this usage?

[03:29:09] <tojil> regarding the RYF, one clear obstacle for me is the price. companies seem to charge you twice or 3x more just for having a RYF sticker... gotta push for more cheaper and popular solutions.

To distribute a nonfree program, to recommend a nonfree program to other people, or more generally steer them into a course that leads to using nonfree software, means leading them to give up their freedom.

[04:49:15] <isf> nice, that is good becouse i see a lot of communities of GNU/linux, who hide the GNU name normaly they always say "install ubuntu that is the goal" but they dont say it
[04:49:23] <isf> but they do it with their example
[04:49:47] <isf> thats the reason i share the free software freedom steps with my example
[04:49:59] <isf> becouse the steps i make are easy and all can do it
[04:49:59] <TheLinuxNerd> isf, there a lot of goals. yes, my individual goal right now is to stick with Ubuntu and not go back to Windows :-D
[04:50:16] <TheLinuxNerd> not relapse on non-free :-D
[04:50:41] <isf> but run a computer with RYF certification isnt something all can do
[04:51:08] <TheLinuxNerd> and only use that Windows secondary PC when I am required by job to do something that just can't be done on Linux
[04:51:16] <TheLinuxNerd> * GNU/Linux
[04:51:57] <isf> when someone say me run this nonfree software 
[04:52:05] <isf> i say, thanks but no with nonfree software
[04:52:24] <TheLinuxNerd> isf, and in Romania they say "You're Fiiiired!"
[04:54:23] <isf> i want be funny, but i dont see like something bad say no to run nonfree software even if is for something i dont want in my will
[04:55:10] <TheLinuxNerd> it doesn't matter how you see it, here it's disobedience to boss.
[04:59:41] <DiffieHellman> Hmm, I wonder why people keep talking about nonfree hardware when the chat's about free software./

[05:45:22] <qrpnxz> isf, with software, i think releasing only object code can be thought of as a kind of defective by design, because the developer, having the source, is in a way purposely taking away your ability to practically make changes (releasing the code would be extremely cheap). Do you agree?
[05:46:23] <isf> im aggre with the free software license as the GPLv3 or later
[05:46:53] <isf> in terms of if you want distribute a software for example a binary you must share it with the source code too
[05:47:15] <qrpnxz> i know you want software to be free but that's not what i'm asking
[05:47:53] <isf> im not a technical user
[05:48:06] <qrpnxz> what part didn't you understand. I can explain
[05:48:16] <isf> but i know the GNU Guix, help in terms of the tehcnical issue about the source code multiple lenguages issue
[05:48:38] <isf> with the GNU Guile or something like that let you change the source code with the same lenguage
[05:48:42] *** Quits: Codaraxis (~Codaraxis@user/codaraxis) (Quit: Leaving)
[05:48:44] <isf> something like that i learn the last night
[05:49:01] <isf> but that is a technical issue not about freedom in the computing freedom itself
[05:49:06] <qrpnxz> guile is an implementation of some variants of scheme (which is a lisp)
[05:49:16] <qrpnxz> a programming language
[05:49:27] <isf> yes, how you see im not a technical user
[05:49:51] <qrpnxz> ok forget that i have another question. one min.
[05:50:01] <isf> for example, for me looks like the software are defective by designs if im not a developer?
[05:50:29] <isf> ofcourse not, i dont need learn how to apply the freedom 1 to modify and study if i dont want  becouse my use my time in others issues
[05:50:41] <qrpnxz> correct
[05:50:41] <isf> the important for me is have the freedom to do it, even if i dont do it
[05:50:47] <qrpnxz> yes
[05:51:04] <isf> all i can do
[05:51:11] <isf> but no all benefit me
[05:51:16] <isf> that is something i believe
[05:51:23] <qrpnxz> i was saying that the object code only can be thought of a defective by design because even if you know programming you cannot really change it, and it would cost almost nothing to just post the source with the program
[05:51:41] <isf> all the software i have in Trisquel i cant change it
[05:51:46] <isf> becouse i dont know how to do it
[05:51:57] <isf> but all is free software becouse i have freedom to do it anyway
[05:52:03] <qrpnxz> yes
[05:52:22] <isf> i have freedom to be wrong and destroy my system
[05:52:24] <isf> too
[05:52:28] <isf> jaja
[05:52:55] <isf> but, i have a community to make questions too and normaly they help me when i have questiosna bout technical issues i dont know
[05:53:12] <qrpnxz> isf, I know your focus is software, but i want to hear your opinion on this: if a musician wrote a song with MIDI, or as an audacity project, or whatever other format for music composition, but they only release the final "render" (the final music file for consumption i.e. FLAC), do you think an injustice has occured?
[05:53:40] <isf> i cant see the injustice 
[05:54:17] <isf> if they make something useful
[05:54:22] <qrpnxz> so if i use a music file, but i cannot really modify it easily, that's ok, but if i use a program and i can't modify it easily, it's not?
[05:54:27] <isf> for example, a machine who can short fruits
[05:54:28] <Andrew> qrpnxz: Is the song meant to be a work of practical use?
[05:54:46] <qrpnxz> let's say it is. For example, some kind of informational audiobook
[05:55:02] <isf> if he make a machine what can cut fruits imagine the machine are working and bad and the other people cant change it becouse have a nonfree license
[05:55:09] <isf> that is the problem we solve with free software
[05:55:09] <qrpnxz> thought it is impossible to know whether any kind of creative work will be practically useful in everyday life
[05:55:21] <qrpnxz> even joy of music is practically useful imo
[05:55:37] <Andrew> qrpnxz: My philosophy of dharing tells me that I'd do so in both cases, if I write a book I will share thr LaTeX source, 
[05:56:07] <isf> free software licenses are for software, you can put it in others things too, but arent for them in the start
[05:56:23] <damo22> music as an artform is a capture of sound, youre not supposed to receive the instructions for how to reproduce the artwork

[05:56:40] <isf> i dont see the injustice in dont share the tabs of a song if you make a song

[05:57:10] <Andrew> analagously
[05:57:12] <qrpnxz> If i create a program that all it does is create an beautiful audio-visual experience on your monitor (perhaps it's a game, or a demo) is that then justified to only be executable and not source then?
[05:57:40] <Andrew> runnable software as a workform is a compilation of source code
[05:57:41] <qrpnxz> any file can be considered a type of instructions for another program to generate a display
[05:58:01] <Andrew> youre not supposed to receive the instructions on how to reproduce the running software
[05:58:03] <isf> if you make a software and you want distribute as a free software you need distribute it with the source code under a free software license
[05:58:05] <Andrew> i.e. the source code?
[05:58:05] <damo22> music is not an executable
[05:58:13] <damo22> i think that part is clear
[05:58:26] <Andrew> damo22: "analagously"
[05:58:51] <Andrew> damo22: i mean they're all used to produce a final usable/enjoyable thing
[05:58:53] <damo22> you can embed music into an executable
[05:59:00] <Andrew> ...
[05:59:02] <damo22> but that can be separate
[05:59:16] <qrpnxz> Andrew, well that is the question. If the fact that it doesn't have a "practical use" means it's okay to not disclose the preferred form for modification (source), then even purely artistic programs should be in that category
[05:59:17] <isf> right now im touching music with my guitar and i dont need share with others the tabs becouse are injustice, becouse arent
[05:59:31] <damo22> yeah, isf
[06:00:02] <Andrew> qrpnxz: Yeah I know.  That's what RMS/FSF thinks of sharing (based on practical works).  My 
[06:00:04] <damo22> its not an injustice to not share source code either btw, you can have private gpl projects
[06:00:07] <isf> but if i sell a machine i need make a manual with all information to learn how works
[06:00:10] <Andrew> personal view is to share everything
[06:00:23] <isf> becouse is inmoral sell a machine if the people who buy cant know what realy do
[06:00:28] <qrpnxz> damo22, we are talking about if you receive the compiled product. For music that is a consumable like FLAC
[06:01:10] <damo22> music does not have to be "compiled".  in its rawest form its just a wave
[06:01:28] <isf> in realy, music is more like the source code itself

[06:02:49] <isf> and in software that mean make the software free under a free license
[06:02:53] <qrpnxz> damo22, the wave is compiled. The source (again, preferred format for modification) of most digital music made today are project files or midi or other formats that specify times, patterns, filters, and reference atomic lossless samples. The final music file is not the source if you made it with MIDI.
[06:04:30] <damo22> qrpnxz: just because there can be a process musicians use to create their art, does not mean they are obliged to share that process recipe.  It could be nice, but its different from software where the end result is an executable that does your computing

[06:06:30] <damo22> i dont think its an injustice to share a FLAC
[06:06:45] <qrpnxz> damo22, ik it's different, ofc it's different, the point is why is the moral consequence different. Why is a music file telling my speakers what to do, and a program telling my speakers what to do, or other hardware what to do, different? If it's a question of "practical use", that's dubious because I think art is practical, but if you say it's not, well some software can be not practical too.
[06:07:19] <qrpnxz> it's similar in important ways
[06:07:24] <damo22> the music file does not tell your speakers how to produce the sound, it only represents voltage over time as a wave form
[06:07:57] <damo22> your music player is the executable
[06:08:02] <damo22> it needs to be free software
[06:08:28] *** Quits: lg543 (~lg543@154.70.46.162) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:08:31] <qrpnxz> it does tell my speakers what to do. No music file, no sound. Music file describe what sound to make. Program can describe more things to do, including what sound to play. I can compose a song with general programming language also.
[06:08:35] <DiffieHellman> In most cases, the music file is a form of source (provided its lossless0.
[06:09:06] <qrpnxz> yes i was going to bring that up, there are tiers of source. FLAC is more preferred for modification than an mp3
[06:09:21] <damo22> flac is like wav+zip
[06:09:23] <qrpnxz> a visual studio project file can be preferred to simply the source of a program
[06:09:31] <isf> the best way to share music, is always without DRM and with free format, for example Ogg or others who arent nonfree
[06:09:42] <DiffieHellman> A midi file with all the instruments for the song would be nice, but isn't required to use or modify the music
[06:09:55] <DiffieHellman> damo22: FLAC is _not_ like wav+zip
[06:10:19] <damo22> DiffieHellman: well, it is a compressed lossless format
[06:10:38] <qrpnxz> yes, but again it's about what is preferred for modification. I can also edit object code of a program. That is of course much worse than editing a FLAC, but editing a FLAC can produce only a fraction of what you could accomplish with the source.

[06:11:12] <DiffieHellman> FLAC is producted by first doing lossy compression similar to opus, and then adding addittional data to make up for the removed frequencies.
[06:11:25] <damo22> DiffieHellman: incorrect

[06:12:02] <isf> the games can be separated in 2 parts software who must be free and art, who must be without DRM
[06:12:03] <damo22> its a reversible compression algorithm applied to a wave file
[06:12:05] <qrpnxz> TheLinuxNerd, game is where all the culture combine yes. Game is just art and entertainment, or can be educational, and it uses all sorts of media as well as general compueter instructions
[06:12:17] <qrpnxz> DiffieHellman, flac is lossless
[06:12:25] <qrpnxz> FLAC stand for Free Lossless Audio Codec
[06:12:39] <DiffieHellman> damo22: Yes, but part of the stage uses techniques similar to opus, but other steps are taken to add data ensure that it's lossless.
[06:12:54] <DiffieHellman> *to ensure
[06:13:17] <qrpnxz> flac is not really at all comparable to opus
[06:13:30] <qrpnxz> flac does linear prediction, opus goes into the frequency domain. It's totally different
[06:13:34] <TheLinuxNerd> I think the compiler, the OS, should be free software
[06:13:35] <DiffieHellman> Yes, but the compressor uses technqiues from the opus compressor.
[06:13:45] <qrpnxz> flac came first, that's not possible
[06:13:51] <damo22> all i know, flac applied to my.wav can be reversed with flac -d my.flac 
[06:13:53] <DiffieHellman> It's completely different, but it's not anything like zipping up a wav file
[06:14:06] <damo22> and i get the same wav back 
[06:14:08] <qrpnxz> flac is more comparable to zip yes
[06:14:20] <qrpnxz> opus and zip are not really comparable
[06:14:59] *** Quits: lg543 (~lg543@154.70.46.162) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[06:15:18] <qrpnxz> Anyway, so these are questions I'm having. My strongest justification for requiring source code from people is really along the lines of right to repair.
[06:15:41] <qrpnxz> I don't really have how to justify the AGPL
[06:16:43] <DiffieHellman> Well, I must have got something in the wrong order, or named the wrong thing than opus, but I do remember reading a rought outline as to how FLAC compression works.
[06:17:37] <DiffieHellman> 3>The encoder then tries to find a good mathematical approximation of the block, either by fitting a simple polynomial, or through general linear predictive coding. A description of the approximation, which is only a few bytes in length, is then written.
[06:17:44] <damo22> DiffieHellman: you might be right, but the whole point of flac is that you can store a smaller file on disk and recover the original wav when you need to play it, which is similar to how zip would work 
[06:17:51] <DiffieHellman> 3>Finally, the difference between the approximation and the input, called residual, is encoded using Rice coding. 
[06:18:01] <qrpnxz> yes
[06:18:08] <DiffieHellman> Yeah, so it uses lossy encoding first and then applies a residual so it's lossless.
[06:18:21] <damo22> ok
[06:19:03] <DiffieHellman> zip is 100% lossless. FLAC changes the data, but manages to encode the same sound wave.
[06:19:08] <damo22> you could achieve a similar thing by streaming a gzipped wav into your player over a gunzip pipe
[06:19:29] <DiffieHellman> Well no, the gzipped wav would be larger.
[06:19:32] <qrpnxz> flac "changes the data" in the same zip changes the data. That's not a distiction to make
[06:19:57] <damo22> well yeah, flac is probably more efficient compressor of audio data
[06:20:12] <qrpnxz> much better
[06:20:14] <damo22> i mean the process would be the same
[06:20:32] <qrpnxz> the result is the same
[06:20:37] <damo22> result*
[06:20:42] <damo22> yea
[06:21:07] <DiffieHellman> I believe zip uses a dictionary, and the replaces patterns with the dictionary contents. So all the data is in the file, you just gotta repeat the parts of the dictionary in the correct places.
[06:21:13] <DiffieHellman> (damn I love being pedantic).
[06:21:20] <DiffieHellman> But I guess we can leave it at that.
[06:22:34] <damo22> the good thing about players that support flac is that they already have the decompressor built-in so you wouldnt need to "unzip" the flac every time you play it
[06:22:50] <damo22> it is done by the player itself

[06:23:11] <DiffieHellman> Yup, the different compression technique is supported by the player. It wouldn't be too hard to make a player be able to take gzip files mind you.
[06:23:35] <qrpnxz> flac is specifically designed to be easy to hardware implement, i don't think about gzip
[06:24:42] <damo22> free software people seem to get caught up in details..
[06:24:52] <DiffieHellman> That's the whole idea.
[06:25:56] <damo22> yeah but we were sidetracked from our main discussion
[06:26:06] <qrpnxz> But to touch back, media can have source too, so i think it's good to GPL that stuff too, not just software.

[06:26:33] <damo22> im not convinced artwork should be GPL'd
[06:27:15] <damo22> in some cases you cant reproduce the artwork because it was a pure audio capture
[06:27:37] <DiffieHellman> It would be a good thing to GPLv3 artwork, but if you don't, you're not evil.
[06:28:45] <damo22> you cant provide source for a pure audio capture, the source would be the wav file
[06:28:54] <qrpnxz> GPL has many features: 1) grant natural freedom, 2) right to repair (so, not purposely defective in the modification department), 3) "not effective technological measure", 4) no tivo. 5) sharealike. All are useful for media as well.
[06:30:12] <qrpnxz> damo22, if you created the music track by directly mutating the audio, then there's not really preferred for for modification, but many many modern productions do have project files, midi, and other build descriptions that are preferred format of modification
[06:30:24] <qrpnxz> s/for for/form for/
[06:31:40] <damo22> a lot of audio productions are made by mutating a bunch of raw audio files, i agree, but the artist wants you to experience the final product and does not intend you will modify it
[06:31:44] <qrpnxz> so like if you edited together your podcast in audacity, the audacity project file would be the preferred form for modifications
[06:32:05] <qrpnxz> if you used https://lmms.io/ or other audio workstation, that project file is the preferred form for modification
[06:32:21] <clever> DiffieHellman: i forget the name of the compression algo, but one i looked at recently, basically had 2 modes, either "here is N bytes to output" and "copy N bytes from output - X", so it could trivially repeat any byte sequence it had previously output (within a certain reach)
[06:32:31] <qrpnxz> damo22, yeah, microsoft intend you only experience the windows they built for you too. So?
[06:32:42] <clever> thats another non-dictionary compression method, but it wouldnt do well for audio
[06:33:33] <damo22> thats clever, i mean here he is
[06:33:45] <qrpnxz> wah wah wah
[06:34:35] <clever> bzip2 still blows my mind, it basically sorts the bytes in the stream, so similar bytes wind up neat eachother, creation a lot of repeating sequences that compress easily
[06:34:51] <clever> but its sorted in some crazy way that allows undoing the sort without any metadata
[06:35:30] <damo22> ive not examined compression algs much
[06:35:58] <damo22> lz was supposed to be interesting
[06:36:47] <damo22> i heard it was patented in gif once

[06:41:40] <DiffieHellman> I wouldn't call it a "right", I would call it a restriction

[06:45:54] <qrpnxz> if my computer makes a sounds from running the instruction in a flac that's okay that we don't have the preferred form of modification, but if it doesn't from running instructions from object file why is that now we need the source?

[14:16:31] <darwin> anyone tried vtm, the console-based window manager from SlackBuilds.org?  It sounds really nice but crashes on Slackware64-15.1+current which is what I want to try it on first.  I'd use Freenix (formerly FreeSlack) but don't have any recently-made open hardware though I do have Freenix on an old T500
[14:22:28] <TheLinuxNerd> seriously? 
[14:22:36] <TheLinuxNerd> Slackware?
[14:22:41] <TheLinuxNerd> it still exists!? O_O
[14:22:59] <darwin> it had a stable update last month
[14:23:03] <darwin> ISO release
[14:23:16] <TheLinuxNerd> is it still installpkg?
[14:23:28] <darwin> and almost daily/weekly stable updates for maybe the past decade.  It still has that but also slackpkg
[14:23:40] <darwin> another such interface is twin (text window environment) which worked but crashed

[20:06:46] <corwin> nckx: it may be more helpful (and less hostile seeming) to simply redirect. e.g. "OK, but how do I <put clear explanation of your needs here>?"
[20:07:23] <isf> At a deeper level, we must not present a nonfree program as a solution because that would grant it legitimacy. Nonfree software is a problem; to present it as a solution denies the existence of the problem.
[20:07:52] <nckx> There was nothing unclear about my question and it was clearly directed at gnoo, not isf.
[20:07:58] <isf> if you want know more about Guix you can find info maybe in #guix

[20:09:22] <nckx> 20 Mar 12:41:45<gnoo> lot's of gnu project support proprietary os, that's one of the main critisim people point when they talk about fsdg

[20:09:22] <nckx> 20 Mar 12:42:56<gnoo> and sice guix supports propretary os, guile must
[20:09:28] <nckx> Hence:
