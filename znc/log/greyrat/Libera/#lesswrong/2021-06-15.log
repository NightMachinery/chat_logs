[00:01:16] <feep> dbohdan: import sparkline;
[00:01:27] <feep> and either build from demo or -Psrc:demo:compiler
[00:01:38] <feep> (packages are like includes but bundled)
[00:02:06] <feep> ie. -Psrc:demo:compiler is "a package called src, in path demo, depending on another package called compiler"
[00:02:32] <feep> (compiler == "build/cx/ at the cx binary", that's why it doesn't work if you copy it elsewhere)
[00:02:40] <feep> er, build/src

[00:02:53] <feep> worrying...

[00:03:17] <rsaarelm> feep: What's the best way to read input from stdin?
[00:03:25] <feep> dbohdan: er, src:demos:compiler, sorry
[00:03:40] <feep> rsaarelm: right now, C functions :( this is version 0.0.3, a *lot* of glue is missing
[00:03:52] <Logos01> PapuaHardyNet: Ehh, startup life. It's slightly more likely to actually occur than not occur, but not enough to bank on.
[00:03:58] <dbohdan> feep: That works.  I didn't notice the bad path.
[00:04:09] <feep> it shouldn't crash anyway :P

[00:06:35] <feep> once there's ranges, it should be something like import std.stdio; stdin.readLines, like D has, but this is weeks off still
[00:12:17] <PapuaHardyNet> Logos01: what's your startup about?
[00:12:28] <PapuaHardyNet> if you are willing to talk about it, of course
[00:14:02] <feep> dbohdan: ping? sorry to annoy, but I wanna merge before I go to bed :D
[00:14:11] <feep> anything I can help with?
[00:14:22] <Logos01> I will explain this poorly but it's basically a kind of social-media format for doctors and patients to communicate and exchange medical records.
[00:14:52] <enterprisey> interesting
[00:15:01] <Logos01> So it takes the place of video streaming platforms for remote consultation and also provides conversation history and medical records transfers.
[00:15:26] <Logos01> And on the care-provider side has some integrated stuff for SOAP note-taking and so on so doctors don't have to write everything up from memory at the end of the day
[00:15:54] <Logos01> And patients can own their own conversation history with any given provider and allow Doctor B to watch a video stream of their previous consultations with Doctor A
[00:15:59] <enterprisey> what general region of the world is this targeted at? are you working with a local hospital?
[00:16:29] <dbohdan> feep: Sorry, I was experimenting with list comprehensions.  Pushed.
[00:16:32] <feep> ~
[00:16:51] <Logos01> Well a previous startup by the same owners of the company I work for is a "Home Health Care" company, and it's at least partially aimed at some of that.
[00:17:14] <PapuaHardyNet> well, it is a very sensible idea
[00:17:15] <Logos01> enterprisey: HHC's are like ... outpatient service centers, basically.
[00:17:55] <Logos01> PapuaHardyNet: We're already in (paid) closed beta for the product, with more customers lined up for the live release which should be the middle of next month.
[00:17:59] <PapuaHardyNet> it is less about innovative technical solutions and more about solving actual people problems. That's always a good sign in my opinion
[00:18:09] <dbohdan> feep: Whee!
[00:18:10] <Logos01> I mean it's basically a phone app.
[00:18:11] <Logos01> But yeah.
[00:18:47] <Logos01> Just the bit where little old ladies can have a conversation about the medication regime with their doctor and then just share the video stream with their son/daughter/nurse afterwards rather than half-assed explain it ...
[00:18:59] <rsaarelm> feep: You've exposed a problem with my universal Advent of Code framework. It wants source files to have names like "1501" but Cx requires symbol-like module names and file names must be module names.
[00:19:09] <Logos01> It's something that might actually reduce unnecessary deaths annually if it takes off. So that's worth working on.
[00:19:58] <PapuaHardyNet> btw, have you already onboarded medical facilities to handle the influx of customers?

[00:21:38] <feep> rsaarelm: you would have the same issue with D
[00:21:41] <Logos01> I don't know how to map that to actual unique patients but the total serverload is remarkably low and I'm architecting for autoscaling infrastructure for the live open release.
[00:22:05] <rsaarelm> Hm, never mind, script fix on my end was actually trivial.
[00:22:21] <PapuaHardyNet> I see. and your revenue model differs among the providers?
[00:22:43] <PapuaHardyNet> or is it that you simply take a cut from whatever revenue a provider makes?

[00:28:23] <PapuaHardyNet> its use as a tool by the customers of the medical organization itself is a plus, but not the core selling point
[00:29:55] <feep> dbohdan: I literally just went and added that! I didn't even have to rebuild the compiler!
[00:29:58] <PapuaHardyNet> (Windows wasn't a very appropriate analogy. Perhaps Slack would be a better example)
[00:30:25] * dbohdan is impressed
[00:30:35] * feep happy sounds!
[00:30:35] <dbohdan> feep: I like the "base 0" in the comprehensions
[00:30:48] * feep does the happy wriggle
[00:30:57] <Logos01> PapuaHardyNet: I mean it's *very* different from Slack, but Slack works at this high an altitude.
[00:31:26] <feep> dbohdan: and that's the point of cx. macros are cool. C people don't know. I want to show them.
[00:31:30] <dbohdan> feep: That means "base data[0]", not a literal zero, right?  Because data can be negative.
[00:31:42] <feep> no it's literally zero rn, which is probably on reflection atrociously wrong
[00:31:47] <feep> it should be -int.max/int.max
[00:31:53] <dbohdan> Yeah

[06:58:59] <Robomot> Fraud, murder, and ignorance about what academic historians do (Fraud, murder, and ignorance about what academic historians do)
[06:59:19] <feep> fraud, murder & ignorance in las vegas
[06:59:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I explained how historians can’t get academic jobs through individual merits in the U.S. or Europe. You need networks. I talked about “markets,” the expectations of what CVs (the academic term for resumes) should look like, and how getting noticed by universities is dependent not just on productivity but also on references from people of great esteem. With every explanation I gave, another question came up. What is a
[06:59:28] <Obormot\Arcturus>  postdoc? What is an editor? What is a letter of recommendation? How does anyone get paid?
[06:59:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> The questions kept coming because the answers I was giving made no sense to how people imagined someone survived as a professional historian. Weren’t historians like artists or writers? Wasn’t their worth and position dependent on the quality of what they produced? Or maybe they were like journalists, paid per column or through working on producing publications? Or maybe historians were like teachers, their employment
[06:59:28] <Obormot\Arcturus>  opportunities dependent on the degrees they had obtained?"
[06:59:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I’m sure it was confusing when I told the lawyers, judge, and jury about how the writing and publishing process works. I said: “People don’t make money working for journals; you do it as a volunteer for the state of the field. There are no paying jobs.”"
[07:00:51] <feep> this seems unlikely
[07:01:01] <feep> like, what's the probability that the value of journal articles would be exactly zero?
[07:01:09] <feep> either people should be getting paid, or they should pay to be published
[07:01:34] <feep> I guess it makes sense if the absolute value is smaller than the cost of setting up a payment infrastructure

[07:03:01] <feep> > Which is fair in a way, but the world is large. How can anyone know enough? Should there be courses on "The World and How to Know Sort of Enough About It?". If not courses, some ideas about how to get a range of knowledge?
[07:03:10] <feep> this suggests a solution that is both exciting and terrifying
[07:03:14] <feep> judge/gpt-3 centaur
[07:03:38] <saturn2> yeah, there's no way historians can really exist. it's just another conspiracy theory
[07:05:11] <Mark_> isn’t it very obvious how academic historians get paid? like all other academics?
[07:05:40] <Mark_> in other words, they have a regular salary as professors, and can apply for funding from the government and sometimes whatever other organizations?
[07:05:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is a confusing article tbh
[07:05:53] <feep> I mean, the *structure* exists and can be looked at
[07:05:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> It fails to answer two pressing questions
[07:06:04] <feep> but generally one presumes a kind of market where value is produced
[07:06:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. So ... what *are* "the archives"??
[07:06:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. Why did this Bonich guy kill Klinger?
[07:06:29] <feep> that seems like a basic question to not answer, considering the title
[07:06:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right??
[07:06:40] <feep> maybe they ran out of funding
[07:06:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> "At the termination of the murder trial, Bonich was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. In her closing arguments, the prosecutor emphasized how Bonich’s crime was premeditated, one which weaponized an “abuse of the American dream” to catch, corner, and eliminate Klinger, his prey." ... but why??
[07:07:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Police determined that Klinger had been in the park alone with a friend, 49-year-old Alexander Bonich. They also discovered that Klinger had wired $85,000 to Bonich in order to purchase an apartment in Astoria. Anyone who knows anything about New York real estate can smell a rat in this story. An apartment in Astoria costs about $700,000, if you’re very lucky. In New York City, real estate fraud is a believable motive for
[07:07:05] <Obormot\Arcturus>  killing. Bonich was arrested posthaste." ... fraud how??
[07:07:07] <Mark_> “In my professional life as a history professor at an elite research university” hmmmmmmmmmmmm I wooonder how these people get paid
[07:07:10] <feep> like academic publishing, there is no why
[07:07:15] <feep> he just did it to advance the state of the field
[07:07:29] <feep> Mark_: it's clear *how* they get paid, it's not clear *why* they get paid.

[09:57:45] <saturn2> Fusxfaranto: it would work
[09:57:51] <feep[work]> Fusxfaranto: it works cause it can be energy positive without being thermal positive
[09:57:58] <spxtr> with a sufficiently nice heat exchanger you'd be able to hold the thing at nearly ambient temperature, but no colder
[09:58:10] * feep[work] thinks
[09:58:15] <feep[work]> spxtr: no you can get colder than ambient
[09:58:16] <saturn2> when i was a kid i built a wrist peltier cooler actually
[09:58:22] <feep[work]> remember that this is not a closed system
[09:58:29] <feep[work]> consider: fridges
[09:58:31] <spxtr> feep[work]: I should've said "with only passive cooling"
[09:58:36] <saturn2> it was ridiculously bulky but it did work
[09:58:40] <feep[work]> oyeah, with only passive cooling with no material loss
[09:59:16] * feep[work] googles "embr wave but cheaper"
[09:59:44] <feep[work]> yeah I think it's pricy af cause it has zero competition
[09:59:44] <feep[work]> shame
[09:59:44] <Fusxfaranto> yeah that's kind of what i mean saturn2
[09:59:58] <feep[work]> wonder if you can 3d print a better one
[10:00:18] <spxtr> I'm so very very glad that I bought an AC. One of the best purchases I've made in terms of QoL/$
[10:00:21] <quanticle> 3D print a peltier? You can do that?
[10:00:21] <Fusxfaranto> i can't imagine they can fit enough cooling in the kind of form factor feep linked
[10:00:26] <feep[work]> quanticle: no but like, the casing
[10:00:30] <quanticle> Ah, okay
[10:00:37] <feep[work]> maybe arduino a controller
[10:00:53] <feep[work]> Fusxfaranto: the idea is that they don't permacool but pulse cool
[10:00:53] <spxtr> feep[work]: that'd be pretty easy to prototype actually, I like the idea
[10:01:23] <feep[work]> ie. charge capacitor, spin up, cool down, recharge etc, maybe the brain does something where it looks at min/max values
[10:01:32] <Fusxfaranto> hmm i believe that
[10:01:41] <spxtr> I think you'd want a battery in there, unfortunately
[10:02:00] <feep[work]> solar might work? you only need this on days where it's hot enough to get a bunch of power out
[10:02:11] <feep[work]> and you can pulse it, meaning you don't need the fan perma running
[10:02:24] <spxtr> wrists aren't exactly the best place for solar cells
[10:02:26] <saturn2> solar power would not be enough
[10:02:36] <spxtr> and bracelets don't have much surface area
[10:03:00] <feep[work]> I think you can get 0.3W
[10:03:01] * quanticle is now imagining feep velcro-ing solar panels to one of these: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714768PohcL._AC_SL1482_.jpg

[10:03:09] <quanticle> And then running wires to his wrist Peltiers
[10:03:13] <feep[work]> if you charge for half a minute, that might do it
[10:03:18] <saturn2> even if you covered your whole body with solar cells it wouldn't do much
[10:03:24] <feep[work]> saturn2: o.o?
[10:03:29] <feep[work]> saturn2: you are way behind the sota of personal solar cells :p
[10:04:00] <feep[work]> a cpu fan uses like 2W
[10:04:12] <spxtr> could pretty easily do a back-of-the-envelope calculation for how much power you would need. might be possible to get some cooling simply powered by body heat
[10:04:14] <feep[work]> meaning you can run it for ~1 in 6 seconds
[10:04:36] <saturn2> a peltier cooler uses like 50w or more
[10:04:40] <feep[work]> ah shit
[10:04:44] <feep[work]> right, fair point
[10:04:45] <spxtr> it scales with area, though
[10:04:46] <feep[work]> go heatsink?
[10:06:22] <quanticle> Okay, forget the umbrella hat then

[10:06:54] <nshepperd2> quanticle: a metal heatsink will definitely feel cooler than ambient
[10:06:55] * feep[work] had a fridge moment
[10:06:56] <feep[work]> we're humans!
[10:07:08] <feep[work]> forget the heatsink, fan directly on wrist skin
[10:07:14] <nshepperd2> since it will dissipate heat to the air faster than your skin can directly
[10:07:16] <feep[work]> direct evaporation cooling
[10:07:36] <quanticle> feep[work]: Dude you just reinvented those neckstrap fans
[10:07:47] <feep[work]> I mean, yes? :D
[10:08:14] <quanticle> Lol
[10:08:15] <spxtr> inject thousands of tiny fluid ejectors into your skin, each one can respond to elevated temperatures and eject a small amount of fluid for evaporative cooling
[10:08:21] <feep[work]> XD
[10:08:31] <feep[work]> right, we have all the hardware, we just need air movement
[10:08:31] <quanticle> spxtr: We need a snappier name for it
[10:08:36] <quanticle> I propose: sweet
[10:08:36] <feep[work]> and we can definitely do pulsed cpu fan on 0.3W
[10:08:39] <quanticle> Because it's sweet
[10:09:23] <quanticle> No wait, it won't be sweet, it'll be salty because we'll need to maintain electrolyte balance. Okay, replace one of those 'e's with an 'a'.

[11:38:05] <quanticle> The problem with XML, as I see it, is that it was never clear what should be attributes and what should be a child CDATA element
[11:38:11] <LeoTal> What's wrong with it as an exchange format? It's chatty but it compresses well. My beef with it is that it's not really human-readable, but machines don't care
[11:38:12] <feep[work]> quanticle: that is one of several problems
[11:38:21] <quanticle> So every format has its own idiosyncracies with regards to that
[11:38:25] <feep[work]> LeoTal: xml validation is fundamentally not semantically versionable.
[11:38:39] <adiabatty> LeoTal: it's tough to tell whether something should go in an attribute or a subelement
[11:38:45] <adiabatty> LeoTal: (during the design phase)
[11:38:45] <feep[work]> this is the second main issue aside the unclear mapping between attributes and children
[11:38:55] <LeoTal> feep[work]: You've lost me. Isn't that what the doctype is for?
[11:39:16] <feep[work]> LeoTal: no because you can only version the doctype itself, you can't be forward compatible unless you leave unvalidated plugin extension slots
[11:39:27] <LeoTal> Ohhhh right
[11:39:29] <feep[work]> like, this is more an xsd issue than xml
[11:39:33] <feep[work]> but those are pretty linked
[11:39:42] <LeoTal> Yeah I've never run into that irl but yeah that's a problem
[11:39:58] <feep[work]> also while scanning a document it's impossible to tell that an attribute is complete

[11:40:11] <quanticle> We've all made mistakes in our youth
[11:40:12] <feep[work]> meaning you need to potentially keep every child attribute of every node in memory while walking the tree

[11:41:55] <saturn2> what if you make a wrapper doctype with the version and the real data in a CDATA
[11:42:25] <feep[work]> you can make the real data json
[11:42:26] <quanticle> <data version="1">lmao</data?
[11:42:36] <quanticle> s/\?/>
[11:42:47] <saturn2> anything is possible with innovative solutions
[11:42:58] <feep[work]> hm, also you can I guess sorta do it with xml, but you need to be prepared to get children in any order
[11:43:07] <quanticle> Modern problems require modern solutions.
[11:43:10] <feep[work]> or you can hardcode order in xsd, a feature that only makes the format even more ambiguous
[11:43:30] <feep[work]> I have a dconf talk where I rant for ten minutes about why xml is shit
[11:43:46] <quanticle> You gave a talk at dconf?
[11:43:50] <adiabatty> what do people here think about newline-delimited JSON where the file is a newline-separated list of objects
[11:43:52] <feep[work]> oh, another aspect is that it absolutely forces a data transfer type type layer
[11:43:55] <feep[work]> quanticle: yeah, dconf online 20
[11:44:01] * quanticle is suitably impressed
[11:44:04] <feep[work]> dconf offline 19 too, but 20 is better
[11:44:12] <saturn2> quanticle: also i'm pretty sure he meant O(1) space
[11:44:15] <feep[work]> yeah
[11:44:17] <quanticle> Ah, okay
[11:44:30] <feep[work]> and yeah you can *kinda* do it with xml if you're prepared to receive children out of order
[11:45:02] <feep[work]> meh
[11:45:15] <feep[work]> my main issue is that it requires @(Xml.Attribute) and @(Xml.Element) annotations
[11:45:22] <saturn2> adiabatty: it's a silly workaround for inadequate parsers
[11:45:28] <feep[work]> as compared to literally every other format that has a 1:1 mapping to "structs, arrays and hashmaps"
[11:45:56] <adiabatty> saturn2: yeah, I'm not a huge fan either. I'd rather have YAML with one dict per document
[11:46:08] <quanticle> Anyway, as bad as XML is... I think I'd still prefer it to CORBA. At least XML is human readable... kinda. It's plain UTF-8, let's put it that way. CORBA is just an opaque binary blob. If you don't have a specification or a pre-built decoding library, you're just SOL.

[11:52:57] <quanticle> "FEEP 1. n. The soft bell of a display terminal (except for a VT-52!); a beep. 2. v. To cause the display to make a feep sound. TTY's do not have feeps. Alternate forms: BEEP, BLEEP, or just about anything suitably onomatopoeic. The term BREEDLE is sometimes heard at SAIL, where the terminal bleepers are not particularly "soft" (they sound more like the musical equivalent of sticking out one's
[11:52:59] <quanticle> tongue). The "feeper" on a VT-52 has been compared to the sound of a `52 Chevy stripping its gears."

[11:55:42] <quanticle> The only thing I know about feep or feeping is that there was this bird that woke me up at 4am for a solid week, going "FEEP FEEP" outside my window; I told feep about it and then the bird stopped. I assume feep had a word and his fellow feeping creature extended him some professional courtesy.

[13:05:53] <adiabatty> I like openbsd, but why are you running it on an AWS box?
[13:06:08] <adiabatty> you want openbsd in the cloud?
[13:07:05] <PapuaHardyNet> nah, I'm trying to set up a deployment endpoint for a temporary dynamic site I'm making as an internship submission
[13:07:43] <PapuaHardyNet> and I have access to AWS, and I dislike heroku since it doesn't just outright give you a box to play with
[13:08:29] <PapuaHardyNet> I could have used ubuntu but I thought this was a good opportunity to get to know openbsd better
[13:08:46] <adiabatty> Fair enough. On the other hand, the nice thing about Heroku is that you don't have to deal with keeping a box up to date…
[13:10:34] <PapuaHardyNet> that's a real benefit I didn't know about. I'll keep that in mind

[16:26:13] <kuudes> that seems to go down but maybe level, LeoTal? are you in france currently?
[16:26:53] <LeoTal> Yep, for the next while or so
[16:27:38] <LeoTal> Cases and deaths are way down due to either the weather or the vaccines or both, but that seems to be slowing, possibly because people are risk-compensating as hard as humanly possible

[16:35:02] <kuudes> it is not specifically vaccine resistant, but vaccine only takes out 9/10 infections

[16:38:00] <LeoTal> Hm should be more like 19/20 no?
[16:38:48] *** Joins: oxide (~lambda@user/oxide)
[16:44:19] <kuudes> the newest uk data indeed would suggest 19/20; israel data suggested 9/10 and iirc over here in finland a local epidemic was about 90%
[16:44:40] <kuudes> the open question is how much vaccines prevent infection to get serious
[16:44:57] <kuudes> israel data leaved it as possibility that they don't or do only very little on that
[16:45:21] <LeoTal> Rephrase?
[16:45:41] <kuudes> ie that it could fit into israel data that 2 dose pfizer would reduce exposures -> infections by 90% and exposures -> deaths by 90%, so infections -> deaths would not be reduced
[16:48:58] <LeoTal> Huh, last I came out from under my rock, the talk was that it reduced infections -> deaths for sure but maybe not exposures -> infections
[16:50:02] <LeoTal> With the mechanism being 1) you mostly catch/transmit from the upper airway but die from the lower lungbits 2) the vaccine makes you make IgG but not much IgA 3) IgG protects the lower bits and IgA the upper ones
[16:53:05] <LeoTal> Hm by "infections" what do you mean? Could you be catching just severe infections, such that there's a threshold effect? My preferred defn would be that you're infected iff you can transmit, but there's no easy way to test for that
[16:56:07] <PlanckWalk> A world in which vaccines reduce infection by 95% and do nothing for severity if infected, is a much better world than one in which infectivity is not reduced at all but severity is reduced by 95%.
[16:57:35] <PlanckWalk> I suspect the one we're in is some of both.
[16:58:00] <PlanckWalk> Just from broad expectations of immune-system properties.
[16:59:00] <PlanckWalk> (Replace "95%" with whatever pretty darn good but not perfect number that seems reasonable)
[17:02:31] <kuudes> well if infectivity is only reduced by 1/x but the disease mutates to increase its infectivity by x, then we are at x/x ie at the starting point
[17:02:51] *** Joins: inky (~inky@141.136.79.172)
[17:03:00] <kuudes> so best would imo be if we would not have to mind the infectivity because the consequences would be near nil, I suppose

Risk of COVID-19 hospital admission was approximately doubled in those with the Delta VOC when compared to the Alpha VOC, with risk of admission particularly increased in those with five or more relevant comorbidities. Both the Oxford–AstraZeneca and Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines were effective in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection

We had insufficient numbers of hospital admissions to compare between vaccines in this respect. The Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine appeared less effective than the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in those with the Delta VOC. Given the observational nature of these da

[17:38:02] <PlanckWalk> I haven't seen anything that says that Delta variant causes 4x more severe disease (in terms of lasting damage or death)
[17:38:26] <PlanckWalk> Some such variant may arise, of course.
[17:39:39] <PlanckWalk> If we can get enough vaccines out fast enough, such variants will at least take very much longer to arise.  But we're not doing great at that in many countries.
[17:40:29] <PlanckWalk> The main thing is to reduce transmission (and therefore mutation)
[17:41:37] <PlanckWalk> It is actually very nice to see lines like "insufficient numbers of hospital admissions to compare between vaccines in this respect"
[17:41:44] <kuudes> iirc alpha variant caused some 1.6x hospitalizations compared to 2020 spring variants, and delta caused more than alpha such that their product was about 4x
[17:42:08] <kuudes> yes, we should get more vaccines
[17:42:34] <kuudes> currently my locale is very near 0 in new infections - today was 0 and last 14 days per 100k persons is ~5 here
[17:42:37] <two2thehead> huh. matches up with my priors
[17:42:44] <PlanckWalk> That sentence alone says that the vaccines are still extremely effective against Delta.
[17:42:46] <kuudes> but I am worried about next fall and winter
[17:43:09] <kuudes> well, extremelely effective, depends on what is one's goalpost
[17:43:18] <PlanckWalk> By every goalpost that matters
[17:43:27] <kuudes> unsure
[17:43:53] <kuudes> if your locale has wide spread of covid, you will still likely get it even if you have been vaccinated and don't take precautions
[17:43:57] <PlanckWalk> No
[17:44:07] <kuudes> if your locale has low spread of covid, it likely protects you
[17:44:08] <two2thehead> wait, more vaccines as in more inoculations per person or more vaccines created per person? 1 != another
[17:44:20] <PlanckWalk> You seem to be assuming independence of exposure->infection chances.  That's not how it works.
[17:44:21] <kuudes> you can't go to covid ward without protective gear even with 2 doses and time.
[17:44:53] <PlanckWalk> Most people can.  They just don't know which, in advance.
[17:44:59] <PlanckWalk> So they don't risk it.
[17:45:37] <kuudes> someone proposed it was about personal immunity deficiency, but we have had infections in prime health doctors with 2 doses and protective gear
[17:45:54] <kuudes> + infections carrying over 2 dosed doctors and protective gear to their homes
[17:45:56] <PlanckWalk> Yes.  Hence "don't know which, in advance"
[17:46:19] <kuudes> well you could just test that with microneutralization test, couldn't you?
[17:46:35] <PlanckWalk> Apparently not :-/
[17:47:14] <PlanckWalk> Or rather, it's not predictive enough to rely.
[17:47:17] <kuudes> I am sceptical we could put much anyone to spend time on covid ward with 2 doses for long duration
[17:47:25] <kuudes> can we do such with measles currently?
[17:47:47] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[17:47:52] <kuudes> oh?
[17:48:14] *** Joins: CuddlePup (~cuddlepup@user/cuddlepup)
[17:48:17] <kuudes> source? do we have some "good treatment" guide that says so somewhere?
[17:49:49] <PlanckWalk> It's not good practice to deliberately forgo protective equipment, obviously.
[17:50:19] <PlanckWalk> But many vaccinated nurses have worked in measles wards for long durations with catching measles.
[17:50:24] <PlanckWalk> without*
[17:50:37] <PlanckWalk> (E.g. my mother, when she was much younger)
[17:50:50] <kuudes> without equipment?
[17:51:29] <PlanckWalk> With equipment, obviously.  Just because you're 95% safe doesn't mean that you deliberately lick measles patients.
[17:52:42] <kuudes> well yes, if you wear protective equipment properly, you are rather unlikely to catch the disease
[17:52:53] <kuudes> the talk was about society that is returning to "normal" ie no masks etc
[17:53:09] <PlanckWalk> What I'm saying is that the equipment alone is not nearly enough.
[17:53:26] <kuudes> so then, if things get to indian/italy/iran/brazil scales, you just have covid everywhere
[17:53:36] <PlanckWalk> Measles is ridiculously contagious.
[17:53:46] <kuudes> yes it is
[17:53:49] <PlanckWalk> (Far more than SARS-nCov-2)
[17:53:58] <kuudes> so far
[17:54:14] <nshepperd> it seems very unreasonable to attribute 99.9% effectiveness of not catching measles entirely to protective equipment and not to being vaccinated
[17:54:31] <PlanckWalk> WHat tends to happen is that some (very few) nurses catch measles early, and the rest don't at all.
[17:54:32] <kuudes> alpha was about 1.5x more contagious than 2020 variant, delta is maybe 2x more contagious than alpha
[17:54:42] <PlanckWalk> (When vaccinated)
[17:54:46] <kuudes> nshepperd, who did so?
[17:55:04] <nshepperd> kuudes did
[17:55:08] <kuudes> O_o where?
[17:55:16] <kuudes> don't invent numbers to my mouth
[17:55:49] <PlanckWalk> If the vaccine was a per-exposure probability reduction, then the "tail" of infected nurses would be much longer.
[17:55:57] <kuudes> I do not note any line in my backlog where I have mentioned "99.9%"
[17:55:58] <feep> update
[17:56:03] <feep> made it home without falling off my scooter
[17:56:06] <feep> going to bed
[17:56:09] <nshepperd> 99.9% is my number
[17:56:10] <kuudes> feep, good
[17:56:28] <kuudes> nshepperd, then "<nshepperd> kuudes did" seems false
[17:56:32] <nshepperd> a measles treatment nurse is likely "exposed" at least a thousand times
[17:56:32] <PlanckWalk> The fact that it isn't, strongly demonstrates that in most cases, the vaccine actually confers *immunity*, not just exposure reduction.
[17:56:35] <kuudes> are you misunderstanding on purpose?
[17:57:17] <PlanckWalk> We don't have such repeated-exposure tests for COVID yet, but it's very unlikely that the immune system works utterly differently on it.
[17:57:44] <PlanckWalk> It is quite likely that vaccination usually confers immunity.
[17:57:59] <PlanckWalk> (At least for some as yet unknown period of time)
[17:58:08] <kuudes> if that is so widely known, then surely you can link me to a textbook on that?

[18:02:39] <kuudes> people on this channel are usually unusually good in backing their beliefs, which is why discussing here is very worthwhile
[18:02:54] <kuudes> so please back your beliefs! this is important!
[18:03:05] <PlanckWalk> Nothing, really.  It's just a thing that I have strong reason to believe based on personal research (I was unable to be vaccinated against measles, so looked up a fair bit on it) and discussions with my mother (who at one point was a nurse working with measles patients and knew many more)
[18:03:14] <kuudes> :-/
[18:03:41] <LeoTal> I have to implement a bunch of changes requested by an UX guy and I vehemently disagree with all of them
[18:03:43] <kuudes> sorry, that does not feel strong enough to bet health of myself and my dearest ones on. but thanks for the opinion, I will take that in mind on updating
[18:03:47] <PlanckWalk> So I don't have specific sources from 20 years ago to give you.  Wikipedia didn't even exist then.
[18:04:44] <kuudes> basicly my current belief is that we should reduce the amount of local spread of covid, and vaccines help much in that. but one should not believe "I have been vaccinated therefore I can't get covid"
[18:04:53] <kuudes> until shown otherwise
[18:04:55] <PlanckWalk> I agree with both
[18:05:16] <PlanckWalk> But I am suggesting that your *model* for believeing those is likely wrong.
[18:05:23] <kuudes> unsure
[18:05:31] <kuudes> but I agree I will soon see if it is wrong
[18:05:49] <kuudes> and me being wrong this way has way less consequences than me being wrong in the contrary position
[18:06:12] <PlanckWalk> For you personally in the short term, yes.
[18:06:35] <kuudes> ie on this way me being wrong causes my dearest ones to miss some amount of a couple of months to see that vaccinated people don't get hospitalized much, on the other way we would end up with health losses
[18:07:18] <kuudes> but it seems to me dangerous for people to talk about being sure the other way, as that causes people to drop restrictions and opening borders etc
[18:07:34] <kuudes> we should wait and see how uk manages stuff and update after that
[18:07:58] <kuudes> they are now having a surge there
[18:08:03] <PlanckWalk> I am very sure that vaccines do not reduce exposure->infection probabilities independently.
[18:08:07] <kuudes> even though they are one of the most vaccinated countries
[18:08:22] <kuudes> yes, but you are unable to back that with evidence
[18:08:29] <PlanckWalk> I can back that much, sure.
[18:08:48] <PlanckWalk> I just can't back up the specific profile of nurses working long term with measles patients.

[18:10:45] <kuudes> it is important!
[18:12:00] <LeoTal> Measles is weird, though, no? For one thing it's ridiculously contagious but the vaccine is ridiculously effective. So it might not carry over. (Though if it's an upper vs lower airway thing, it might)
[18:16:03] <Logos01> So as a minor distraction from how my home being put up for sale by the landlord is screwing me, I have a thought I would like to vett for discussion.
[18:16:13] <PlanckWalk> Hmm, rabies is probably too dissimilar in effects to be a reasonable comparison.
[18:16:20] <Logos01> Namely; more atheists who care about things like "ontology" should be aware of the concept of virtual objects.
[18:16:46] <Logos01> Especially since a solid understanding of them makes it much easier to ease people who believe in "the soul" into a more naturalistic worldview.
[18:17:14] <Logos01> You don't have to go to the point of computer science to make this point -- you can look at the weirdness that philosophers get up to when trying to discuss whether or not holes exist.
[18:17:42] <LeoTal> Ontology is the study of surjective functions
[18:17:45] <Logos01> Yes, holes as in the things you can dig in the ground with a shovel when you're trying to make a well or to bury a landlord's body.
[18:18:17] <nshepperd> obviously exposure->infection is not independent
[18:18:20] <Logos01> LeoTal: Ontology is the set of all things you believe exist or could exist given your epistemology. Instantiated instances of the classes, if you will.
[18:18:23] <nshepperd> that would be remarkable
[18:18:36] <PlanckWalk> nshepperd: Yeah, but proving it to a skeptic seems difficult.
[18:18:45] <Logos01> So anyhow. The idea I'm getting at here is pretty straightforward.
[18:18:49] <nshepperd> i expect there are degrees of correlation
[18:19:10] <Logos01> One of the things that drives people to soul-belief is the 'gut feeling' that "they" are not their bodies, that they have a homunculus.
[18:19:19] <LeoTal> Logos01: I see you are attempting to punish my joke by pretending not to get it. Unfortunately for you, I am more than capable of playing along and explaining it at length while you beg me to stop.
[18:19:24] <Logos01> OR are the homunculus. We don't need to be precise here, if you know the concept it's fine.
[18:19:47] <Logos01> LeoTal: I'm an agorophobic autist who is losing the roof over his head so I'm freaking out and it's fresh so I'm poor at humorification right now. Sorry.

[18:25:19] <Logos01> I haven't heard back from the rental agency yet about the possibility of me being the one to buy the house, but the notice did say they're giving me first opportunity to make an offer.
[18:25:23] <LeoTal> Huh, here that's multiple kinds of illegal
[18:25:26] <Logos01> I did ask how much they're asking for.
[18:26:00] <Logos01> LeoTal: It's more than 30 day's notice, and doesn't break any leasing agreements. 
[18:26:06] *** Quits: pkkm2 (~pkkm@dgs4.neoplus.adsl.tpnet.pl) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[18:26:23] <Logos01> It's just kinda really shitty for me because the housing situation right now is such that it can take more than a month to get a decent place.
[18:26:33] <kuudes> over here if the landlord ceases the lease, then it is 3 months notice period if lease has been less than 12 months and 6 months if more
[18:26:48] <Logos01> kuudes: I'm not actually on a lease right now though.
[18:26:54] <Logos01> I've just been paying them monthly rent.
[18:26:55] <kuudes> sublease?
[18:27:00] <kuudes> O_o
[18:27:09] <LeoTal> Here it's very illegal to rent without a lease (of course people still do it)
[18:27:17] <Logos01> The original lease expired and had a clause that without renewal you can just keep paying monthly.
[18:27:43] <kuudes> over here that is considered in the law to just be a lease with the original terms but without end date
[18:27:43] <Logos01> I mean strictly I still have the original lease, it's just that the actual term of the lease ended more than a year ago.
[18:27:48] <kuudes> so 6 months notice etc
[18:28:26] <kuudes> and those notice periods are things the law says can't be negotiated to lower for renter's harm
[18:28:41] <kuudes> but yeah, sounds sucky
[18:29:00] <kuudes> my landlord offered me to buy the housing as well, but it was in too bad of shape for my interest
[18:29:01] <Logos01> kuudes: Yeah but I live in Republistan.
[18:29:04] <Logos01> https://www.utahlegalservices.org/node/22/no-cause-eviction
[18:29:05] <kuudes> indeed indeed
[18:29:07] <Robomot> No Cause Eviction - ULS (A tenant and a landlord can end a tenancy for no reason at the end of a lease or when the tenant is living in the property on a month to month basis. This can be done if the landlord or the tenant give to the other person what is often called a “No Cause” notice.)
[18:29:22] <Logos01> For month-to-month tenants the minimum is 15 days before the end of *that* month.
[18:30:02] <LeoTal> A month and a half should be enough to rent or buy something else. If not, do you have anywhere you can crash while you look?
[18:30:05] <kuudes> surely some landlord would be happy to get a decent sysadmin as their tenant?
[18:30:24] <kuudes> I mean, you sound like a good tenant
[18:30:37] <Logos01> I'm not exactly a high-maintenance tenant (in any context, really.)
[18:30:59] <Logos01> The thing that's stressing me the most is that I haven't had to look for a house for myself in 16 years.
[18:31:03] <kuudes> put a question on facebook or similar?
[18:31:08] <kuudes> yeah
[18:31:16] <kuudes> it is indeed a thing that causes stress
[18:31:30] <Logos01> And my agoraphobia thing is muuuch worse these last two-three years than they've been before.
[18:31:51] <kuudes> iirc home relocation was around there in divorce and relative's death in us military grief-point checklist or something
[18:32:07] <Logos01> This *should* be trivially easy for me to resolve but I'm not handling it at all well and I am taking this as a genuine sign that once I get past this hurdle I *need* to find a psychiatrist.
[18:32:18] <Logos01> Because I should not be physically shaking in fear at this.
[18:32:26] <kuudes> yeah, that sounds bad
[18:32:32] <Logos01> (Like right now I'm not but I was last night.)
[18:32:38] <kuudes> do you have an close adult to get you a place?
[18:32:43] <Logos01> No.
[18:32:46] <kuudes> dang
[18:32:55] <Logos01> I have no friends or family in the state to speak of.
[18:33:05] <Logos01> No friends to speak of, no family at all.
[18:33:11] <kuudes> quanticle, saturn2 do you guys know anyone who could manage this for Logos01?
[18:33:16] <Logos01> (I mean, my family is alive but they're out of state.)
[18:33:47] <Logos01> kuudes: I've put out several emails to possible places to rent already, and I've contacted my property management company to get a quote on the asking price to see if I can/want-to meet it.
[18:34:24] <Logos01> I'm also waiting to hear back from a repair shop that I have been told has the software needed to fix my car (it's a computer fault, I'm morally certain of this and have confirmed it), so that I can get it all resolved.
[18:34:48] <Logos01> And I have 46 days left on the clock here so I'm not like desperate or anything.
[18:34:52] <kuudes> good, good
[18:35:00] <kuudes> you have this channel at least :)
[18:35:16] <Logos01> Plus my job is extremely flexible on scheduling for handling these issues so I Can just drop whatever to get things done whenever.
[18:35:34] <kuudes> oh, could you escalate this to your job hr? they are usually competent in this sort of things?
[18:35:35] <LeoTal> Logos01: You seem to be handling it great — you're doing what needs done, there's no extra points awarded if you don't shake or complain while doing it. Treating the agoraphobia can't hurt, though
[18:35:45] <Logos01> I think I've been in the office at my job like 3 times since I started in February, at not once since April.
[18:36:01] <kuudes> could you call them or email them?

[18:36:39] <Logos01> kuudes: Hrm... didn't think about contacting HR. I don't think I'm in that place just yet. Maybe if I'm still stuck spiraling as of July1st.
[18:37:17] <Logos01> I *HAVE* told my manager & boss -type people about my situation so they at least know to expect this to be distracting me.
[18:37:42] <kuudes> usually this sort of things are where bossthings are very happy to help, as this is a thing they can do something about
[18:37:44] <Logos01> Also because I trust the boss-type on a personal level enough to kvetch to him about stuff sometimes.
[18:37:50] <kuudes> code etc is a thing they usually can't do anything
[18:37:58] <kuudes> that sounds excellent!
[18:38:26] <Logos01> Like if this *had* to happen to someone I'm probably one of the better-situated people *for* it to happen to.
[18:38:54] <Logos01> It would just be better if I had actually been working that two year gap that ended back in August.
[18:39:06] <Logos01> 'cause I could easily buy a house and also would have waaay more savings. But meh.
[18:39:14] <Logos01> Anyhoo. The ontology and diggy diggy soul thing.

[18:39:47] <Logos01> Like, people often say "the mind is the brain and the brain is the mind" and that's the monist model of cognition.
[18:40:26] <nshepperd2> the shape of that chart seems to basically bear out the claim that measles protection is nearly all-or-none
[18:40:27] <Logos01> But for a wide swathe of people, this just isn't *persuasive* despite all the evidence that demonstrates quite exhaustively that what affects the brain affects the mind and what affects the mind affects the brain.
[18:40:44] *** Quits: plutonic (~user@130.44.155.145) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[18:40:54] <Logos01> These are the sorts of people who buy into shit like TAG (the Transcendental Argument for God)
[18:41:09] <nshepperd2> vaccinated people either got infected very shortly afterward, or never got infected
[18:41:12] <Logos01> Which is the idea that there are "external, transcendent" truths which is why math works.
[18:41:18] <kuudes> nshepperd2, does that chart mean that without vaccine only about 0.0017 of people would contract measles?
[18:41:29] <nshepperd2> but for an insignificant number of stragglers
[18:41:33] <Logos01> Because God is the omnipresent consciousness in which the number 2 resides so that everyone else can use it.
[18:41:49] <Logos01> But ultimately this is a product of *failure to understand holes.*
[18:41:54] <gwern> feep: as it should!
[18:42:06] <Logos01> I'm more than halfway serious here.
[18:42:24] <LeoTal> nshepperd2: Hang on, it just says that the vaccine is usually "all" (after it kicks in)… perhaps I'm confused what we're talking about
[18:42:25] <nshepperd2> kuudes: it means that only about 0.0017 of people did contract measles, in the environment of the study
[18:42:40] <Logos01> Virtual phenomena are things that are real in the sense that they can be interacted with, observed, and be stated to have characteristics -- but do not have any physical substance in and of themselves.
[18:42:58] <kuudes> nshepperd2, hmm, that seems to mean it is very rare
[18:43:05] <Logos01> And the inner homunculus is a virtual machine.
[18:43:14] <kuudes> but also the 0 group seems to have very few infections after point of t+1.5y
[18:43:17] <nshepperd2> yes, the study environment was america
[18:43:28] <Logos01> You are not your brain; you are the information that your brain encodes and executes.
[18:43:33] <kuudes> and 1 group had infections to about t+1y
[18:43:43] <Logos01> Like everybody in this channel should, presumptively, grok that fact.
[18:43:56] <Logos01> But it's conveying it to others that's a touch harder.
[18:44:27] <kuudes> so if we just multiplied the 0 group with ~ 0.0002/0.0017, wouldn't the lines be about same form?
[18:44:28] <nshepperd2> the 1 group does not appear to be a scaled down copy of the 0 chart
[18:44:36] <Logos01> Especially since, as I'm saying this, in a certain sense I'm saying that no one actually exists.
[18:44:40] <Logos01> But we're all real.
[18:45:07] <Logos01> Anyhoo. I'mma go have some tea and stop trying to be too tryhard about the early morning thinkery.

[18:45:44] <Logos01> Like to the casual transhumanist this isn't a weird or exciting statement.
[18:45:52] <LeoTal> Lemme rephrase the question. We have a disease that, if you're unvaccinated, you always catch if you kiss a frog. We have a vaccine that we know is 97% effective: 3% of vaccinated frog-kissers got the disease vs 100% of unvaccinated ones. But there are two ways this could be true. Maybe every time you kiss a frog, you have a 3% chance of catching the disease. Or maybe the vaccine rolls a d100 when it's injected; 97% of the time it pro

[18:45:55] <kuudes> hmm "This database is publicly available through the US Medicaid system."
[18:46:10] <LeoTal> nshepperd2, kuudes, PlanckWalk: Is this the question we're asking?
[18:46:12] <Logos01> Dyo: After all, I'm suggesting that mind uploads are possible.

[18:47:10] <Logos01> There *IS* however an interesting potential caveat about the statement in something it susses out which breaks one of my existing intuitions.
[18:47:30] <kuudes> LeoTal, yes, that seems to be the question
[18:47:32] <Logos01> It contradicts qualia.
[18:47:34] <Logos01> https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-knowledge/
[18:47:35] <Robomot> Qualia: The Knowledge Argument (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
[18:48:00] <kuudes> and the reality seems to be something between those extremes, but the question is on where in betwee
[18:48:08] <Logos01> If you have Mary in the colorless room and provide her with all possible "scientific" knowledge of the color red she does *not* learn something about the color red the first time she leaves a room and sees a rose.
[18:48:20] <kuudes> Logos01, I don't believe qualia are meaningful
[18:48:29] <Logos01> Because that "scientific" knowledge would include the necessary thought experiments to synthetically induce the experience.
[18:48:43] <kuudes> mary can cause red feeling by putting electricity in her brain's "sense red" circuit
[18:49:07] <Logos01> kuudes: Or just hypnogogically inducing synesthesia or something. But yes.
[18:49:12] <kuudes> indeed
[18:49:20] <LeoTal> kuudes: Thanks! So, I don't see how the chart nshepperd2 linked answers that question (about measles). What am I missing?
[18:49:54] <Logos01> kuudes: I would use that *rather* than "wiring up the sense red circuit" because it implies that the experience is induced with knowledge of the product.
[18:50:04] <Logos01> Rather than blind operation of a circuit.
[18:50:17] <LeoTal> kuudes: Also, why do you want to know? Is being 3% vulnerable very different from having a 3% chance of being 100% vulnerable, given that there's no test for it (is there?)?
[18:50:33] <Logos01> I.e.; you're using *knowledge* to induce experience of specifically red, rather than happening to identify where experiencing red lives in the brain.
[18:50:38] <Logos01> If you get the difference.
[18:51:45] <kuudes> LeoTal, if 97% of vaccinated frog kissers don't contract the disease and we will be in an environment where frogs will be flying anywhere, people who have got the vaccined don't have to isolate to their homes because they can dare it once and if they don't find themselves infected, they can conclude they are safe
[18:52:15] *** Joins: srhm (~ascii@user/srhm)
[18:52:33] <kuudes> whereas if you have that the vaccine only reduces the chance to get ill to 3% compared to normal per frog kiss, you will still have to ration your frog kisses because eventually you will roll under 3%
[18:52:55] <kuudes> in the former state we do not have to close borders to keep frogs out

[18:53:17] <kuudes> because the frogs will just infect some 3% of the population and we will be done with it
[18:53:28] <kuudes> in the second scenario the frogs will eventually get us all infected
[18:54:10] <kuudes> PlanckWalk, nshepperd2, did I describe the scenarios correctly?
[18:54:24] <LeoTal> Huh so your plan is to straight-up sacrifice the people who can't get the vaccine and people for whom it doesn't work, not build up herd immunity around them?
[18:54:56] <Logos01> kuudes: In my version you're actually encoding knowledge of the experience, rather than knowledge about where the experience occurs. You see that distinction?
[18:56:00] <kuudes> LeoTal, well, that is sort of what our "getting to herd immunity" is about, I think
[18:56:08] * gwern reads about freenode just... deleting its userbase and starting over with a blank sheet. the cocaine/amphetamine allegations certainly seem a lot more plausible now. also, this pretty much refutes any argument that 'maybe we should've stayed at freenode?' lee has helped you out - you get an IRC network migration, she gets a migration, *everyone* gets a migration! you just get to choose whether 
[18:56:14] * gwern it's libera, 'freenode', or other
[18:56:47] <Logos01> (Short-form; activating the brain could result in experiencing blue instead of red due to a miswired individual brain. With the induced synesthesia you have to specifically target the color-experience rather than the location of the color-experience.)
[18:56:56] <Logos01> gwern: Apparently Freenode has also permabanned IRCCloud.
[18:57:00] <kuudes> Logos01, I am unsure if you can induce experience of red with just meditation
[18:57:11] <kuudes> but with electricity I don't see any problem
[18:57:29] <LeoTal> kuudes: Whose? Like, I'm pinning my hopes on covid not getting to the vulnerable people, because the effectively-vaccinated people make the contagion graph not percolate
[18:57:36] <kuudes> and I believe we have about "same" red circuit in all human brains
[18:57:54] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: ...what happened *now*

[18:59:26] <Logos01> kuudes: I would call that "not entirely ruled out" -- but then again Mary could just eat greyscale shrooms and guided-meditate the trip to do it.
[18:59:31] <Logos01> Which counts.
[18:59:34] <kuudes> LeoTal, over here the chief vaccinologist has started to talk about actual herd immunity "now that we have got much people vaccinated", "we have to withstand some amount of illness"
[18:59:44] <Khoth> I think if you're still on the old one you aren't kicked off, but if you disconnect you can only rejoin the new one
[18:59:51] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: no, this is a good thing. it's the final nail in the coffin, and also, now that everyone has been deleted, you don't have to worry about your account expiring and impersonation - *every* freenode account no longer exists and so everyone on 'freenode' will be assumed to be fake until proven real
[19:00:15] <kuudes> Logos01, sure. I find it unlikely but works for me
[19:00:25] <kuudes> ie I don't rule it out with logic etc
[19:00:50] <kuudes> "1500 people per year die in finland to influenza"
[19:01:21] <kuudes> ie it does not cause strain on the hospital system, people die slowly enough
[19:01:25] <Khoth> I have no idea why they've done this. The tentative explanations I've seen are "too much drugs" and "they wanted to do a real migration but fucked it up and now they're pretending they meant to do that"
[19:02:42] <kuudes> basicly for some part of decision makers the thing to protect is the societal order, not that much the lives or health, and well, they may be well calibrated, maybe

[19:02:53] <kuudes> I am putting my hopes into the minister of health
[19:03:23] <LeoTal> kuudes: Well, I don't entirely disagree, in that if you aren't an island it isn't really possible any more to pull a New Zealand and eradicate the damn thing via repeated lockdowns until your population reaches herd immunity via vaccination alone. But uhhh I feel like there could be fewer deaths than just balls-out-yolo
[19:04:13] <kuudes> LeoTal, well, I disagree, because finnish population has soon twice eradicated the local disease without vaccines
[19:04:29] <kuudes> we did it in 2020 and we are now doing it again
[19:04:36] <kuudes> with just contact reduction
[19:04:41] <kuudes> it is weird and wonderful
[19:04:45] <LeoTal> Nice!
[19:04:49] <nshepperd2> actual herd immunity is the whole point of vaccination
[19:05:22] <kuudes> imo we should at least wait for uk situation because that seems to offer the rest of us nice evidence one direction or another
[19:05:31] <nshepperd2> well, most of the point
[19:05:38] <LeoTal> Oh and you're > 50% of half-vax pop now, so you don't have to hold on much longer
[19:05:48] <nshepperd2> like, eradicating diseases
[19:05:57] <kuudes> like, it would be pretty unethical to cause a vaccinated population to have widespread covid, but now that it has happened, might as well get benefits out of it
[19:06:08] <kuudes> LeoTal, uk has >50% 2 dosers and >75% 1 dosers
[19:06:14] <kuudes> and they still seem to be getting exponential
[19:06:34] <LeoTal> kuudes: Yeah the UK is absolutely determined to fuck this up as many times as they can

[19:07:37] <Logos01> kuudes: I'm still more lenient of the "pop shrooms to intentionally hallucinate a rose to see the color red" Thing because you're cognitively constructing the rose from first principles in that case, is all.
[19:07:53] <Logos01> I find that more ... argumentatively persuasive, for what's likely a petty reason.

[19:08:06] <|dbotdan> Gaurav Venkataraman (@gaurav_ven, 2021-06-15 13:29): ‘Well done!  We were able to change our research from intracellular neuronal computation to efficacy of lateral-flow tests due to the freedom of our Emergent Ventures grant.  And nobody in the UK would fund it! | Easier to do the thing than get funding for the thing. | (@Dominic2306)’
[19:08:18] <kuudes> Logos01, I guess a thing that comes to my mind in that experiment is "how would one know which of the colors in their mind is red?"
[19:08:58] <kuudes> my point on red is "red is the color of living meat" and that is about same between humans, and likely also between mammals etc
[19:09:13] <Logos01> kuudes: Well if Mary has *all* physical information on the subject then she can take the necessary steps to properly vett the color's encoding.
[19:09:24] <Logos01> Etc., etc..
[19:09:40] <kuudes> indeed. and in physical environment there is no option for everything to be white and black and gray
[19:09:42] <nshepperd2> LeoTal: on second thoughts i'm not sure that that chart answers the question very well
[19:09:46] <kuudes> because of light's physical properties
[19:10:15] <LeoTal> Well I see 3 plans: 1) Australia: close borders; whenever you get a case, hammer lockdown until you get to 0 cases; repeat until enough people are vaccinated that you can reopen. 2) UK: reopen now because lol. 3) Nobody: do Australia but continue until the whole world is at herd immunity, because you're worried about vaccine resistance and about mild-but-still-yikes infections in the vaccinated. Are you advocating (3) over (1)?
[19:11:06] <kuudes> I think maybe yes
[19:11:21] <kuudes> mind you that we have shown we can have some amount of contact and not get local spread
[19:11:32] <kuudes> ie it seems that we can maybe have cargo etc
[19:11:49] <Logos01> Point being, you could simulate somehow the relevant processes to 'colorize' known things based on what that type of object's color would be outside the greyscale room.
[19:11:58] <Logos01> Anyhoo, too much effort on something we all already agree on.
[19:12:00] <kuudes> and indeed it would make sense to allow low amount of "sparkles" from the border to the population, as long as we can shut down local chains
[19:12:15] <Logos01> Need to get my car cleaned out so I can un-embarrasedly have it towed.
[19:12:28] <kuudes> Logos01, yeah, I think tl;dr: at least to me is "qualia does not seem to make that much of sense"
[19:12:29] <LeoTal> Yeah fomites don't matter
[19:12:45] <Logos01> (Hopefully once I get it fixed I'll be able to get it to a registration/emissions-test place without getting a ticket since I don't have a printer to print out a copy of temp-registration.)
[19:13:01] <kuudes> we already have our covid app intake at ridiculous levels and we may get >80% vaccination rate etc
[19:13:05] <LeoTal> (I still don't know if it's "antisemites" or "Yosemites")
[19:14:00] <LeoTal> kuudes: My problem with (3) is it's going to take years, maybe forever. For (1) you can vax your own country and call it done
[19:14:19] <kuudes> 1 seems to be what they are currently advocating
[19:14:25] <kuudes> I fear it won't work
[19:14:42] <gwern> 'We initially imagined that the scientists at the top universities would swiftly receive abundant funding, and that Fast Grant’s comparative advantage might lie in identifying promising work outside of the most prestigious institutions. Even though we did not formally count institution environment and reputation at all in our assessment methodology (unlike, for example, NIH grant scoring...
[19:14:46] <kuudes> I hope the healthcare minister can delay it enough that uk has exploded, so that everyone will again fear bodybags
[19:14:48] <gwern> ...processes), we were surprised to see that a large fraction of our grants went to people at top twenty institutions, with major recipient institutions including Berkeley, Stanford, MIT, and UCSF. Furthermore, many of these Fast Grant recipients had received minor to no other funding at the time of their application. We didn’t expect people at top universities to struggle so much with...
[19:14:54] <gwern> ...funding during the pandemic.'
[19:15:16] <kuudes> gwern, :-(
[19:15:25] <kuudes> also, the finnish nasal vaccine did not get government funding

[19:46:09] <nshepperd2> gwern: i formatted the danbooru tags by replacing underscores with spaces to better match what CLIP would be used to, so you might want to do that
[19:46:12] <gwern> nshepperd2: oh. your dall-e doesn't include any text tokens in the VAE-token-sequence for the GPT?

[19:46:57] <nshepperd2> it just passes the CLIP embedding vector

[19:47:36] <Logos01> two2thehead: Oh it's great. The game is apparently high scifantasy and it includes plant-people, furries, cyborgs, and we'retotallynotgoa'uld.
[19:48:01] <Logos01> But no colonialism or slavery.
[19:48:01] <Betawolf> that's a lot of personal slaves
[19:48:09] <Logos01> Despite coming from a deeply slave-keeping culture.
[19:48:12] <Logos01> Because Africa.
[19:49:09] <gwern> nshepperd2: it's a good first start. I assume there's nothing inherent in it that stops you from taking a BPE encoder and just prepending the tags and retraining?
[19:49:15] <two2thehead> at my most charitable interpretation, maybe they had 'that' political upheaval/war in the past and are just not mentioning it yet?
[19:49:36] <Betawolf> I mean, how do you even use 12,000 slaves? Is there some sort of pyramid operation going on here -- do your personal slaves have slaves, to help them better focus on serving you?
[19:49:48] <Logos01> Betawolf: He was the Jeff Bezos of his era.
[19:49:48] <gwern> (hotstarting it - the GPT may be confused initially but should figure it out, and it's a sequence model so it has no fixed dimension length)
[19:50:14] <Logos01> His total procession for the pilgrimage included some 60,000 free people as well as the 12,000 slaves.
[19:50:38] <Betawolf> Oh, okay, so they were serving others. I was thinking it was just one household.
[19:51:11] <Logos01> I mean he was the ruler of the Mali Empire.
[19:51:31] <Logos01> Well, while he ruled it he was, not for like the whole tenure of the Mali Empire.
[19:52:11] <Logos01> It *IS* worth remembering who the dude was because for a while there the Mali were pretty much the wealthiest state outside of Asia, and today basically nobody knows about them.
[19:52:37] <gwern> (but muh path dependency and poverty traps)
[19:53:03] <Logos01> But "Mother Land" is apparently based on the historical footnote of the fleet he actually did gather together in the 1300's to go to the New World, which never actually made it -- apparently here they basically got wormholed to a far off alien world?
[19:53:15] <Logos01> And they're billing it as "A TTRPG free from colonialism and slavery"
[19:53:32] <Logos01> And like ... you *KNOW* that fucking fleet had a significant slave presence. Full stop.
[19:54:25] <pompolic_> not very diverse of them
[19:54:28] <LeoTal> If you want a prestigious and powerful and very old ancestor, you can't really afford to be picky about stuff that was near-universal back then, but yes it makes this a little odd

[19:58:57] <pompolic> some sort of implicit primacy of social reality over what actually happens

[20:04:25] <Logos01> He was imprisoned for obscene acts *many* times.
[20:04:53] <Logos01> And the point is, at the time it was in fact the general consensus a lot of times that the things he talked about *WERE* obscene.

[20:08:55] <pompolic> but i'm pulling your leg; i agree
[20:09:17] <LeoTal> I think I'm broadly in favour of having different levels of acceptable obscenity in different places
[20:10:02] <Logos01> LeoTal: Well sure.
[20:10:22] <Logos01> Like, there's a *difference* between being obscene and after-the-fact proclaiming "Oh I was just kidding!"
[20:10:39] <Logos01> And specifically establishing the satirical stance and *then* being obscene.
[20:10:40] <LeoTal> Polnareff's song that goes "I'd like to make love with you" was perfectly legal but could only be played on the radio late at night. Seems better than both 1) banning it and 2) inflicting obscene songs on everyone, thus raising the bar for what counts as obscene ever higher
[20:11:43] <pompolic> i think "better" really depends on what you want to achieve

[20:15:12] <gwern> putting in stuff for adults is pretty common in animation and children's material in general, and is often an explicit goal. like lauren faust's MLP bible says that a major FiM goal is to make something that moms can watch with their 6-9yos. having some lewd humor is not too surprising

[20:30:17] <Logos01> "Probably just a family pet"
[20:32:33] <LeoTal> pompolic: I used to feel like I had a good handle on the nerd types who ask "but why shouldn't we create a race-based slavery system, imagine the opportunities for efficient specialisation" vs the normal asshole types, but the latter has launched campaigns to seduce the former so now I'm less clear on who's who
[20:33:15] <pompolic> my first thought is that the latter group is more likely to engage in epistemic consequentialism
[20:33:22] <pompolic> not sure if this is actually true
[20:33:48] <LeoTal> I don't understand those words in this order
[20:33:55] <pompolic> but the nerd type is less likely to start from the bottom line "i want slavery" maybe
[20:34:29] <pompolic> epistemic consequentialism is just belief in belief
[20:34:45] <pompolic> believing things because one thinks it has beneficial effects regardless of truth value
[20:35:19] <Betawolf> the plus side of slavery is you don't need to do work you don't want to, the negative is other people do and that's mean. A true engineer just creates slaves that aren't people so then nobody has to work.
[20:35:42] <pompolic> modern problems require modern solutions

[20:36:09] <LeoTal> Betawolf: I agree but prefer different vocabulary.
[20:37:34] <Betawolf> I mean we don't have to call them slaves, but I care far less about that, and if some people enjoy calling robots slaves then I feel like they can probably just go for it.
[20:37:51] <pompolic> anyway, i guess my point was, "i think the nerd type would be able to explain the process by which they came to the conclusion that race-based slavery is good, but normal assholes would probably only be able to reiterate the belief"
[20:38:16] <pompolic> but again, i'm not sure if this is actually true
[20:38:24] <nshepperd2> ('the word robot means slave')
[20:38:24] <Betawolf> (I guess the old-fashioned approach to 'create slaves that aren't people' is just to redefine 'people')
[20:38:27] <LeoTal> pompolic: The nerd type gamely follows the quest for truth wherever it leads (knowing the answer is generally "to complete ostracism", but not caring enough to stop), whereas the deliberate asshole type tends to live in social reality more than experimental-prediction-land
[20:38:57] <pompolic> pretty much
[20:39:20] <pompolic> nshepperd2: iirc it means "work" in russian
[20:39:36] <pompolic> not sure if there's a connotation about the particular type of work, but probably "labor"
[20:40:26] <LeoTal> I think it has various bad consequences if I phrase as "I order my slave to swallow my bodily waste, which is morally acceptable to me because I don't consider robots to be people" what most people would phrase as "I flush the toilet"
[20:41:18] <pompolic> tangentially related: i dislike when people conflate "person" and "human"
[20:42:47] <pompolic> i think it's less about sneakily redefining personhood, and more about builtin "human" category membership tests also working for "person" membership tests
[20:44:17] <LeoTal> I specifically use "human" to mean the species and "person" to mean, y'know, the thingies it's bad to kill and whose preferences matter and stuff. Robots aren't people and won't be people unless some cunt fucks shit up real bad; humans become people sometime before or after birth (unsure when); heavily disabled humans often seem not to be people but always turn out to be people so don't try no funny shit; chickens aren't people but th
[20:44:18] <LeoTal> e vegans mistakenly believe they are
[20:44:18] <pompolic> mostly because it's actually pretty easy to fail the "Turing test" but for being human

[21:22:42] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern: what would take far too long?

[21:23:30] <feep> the true future of micropayments
[21:23:33] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: so then no one will use it if it has to lock up their browser for a day per pdf
[21:23:39] <PapuaHardyNet> the idea is to earn the shitcoin equivalent of pennies per user download
[21:24:08] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern: does mining on CPU lock the browser?
[21:24:28] <gwern> I really think you should go sketch out the compute requirements here to at least order of magnitude
[21:24:32] <PapuaHardyNet> I guess I'll need to test it. I've browsed the internet very comfortably while running xmrig
[21:24:46] <feep> you probably want to keep cpu load low enough that the fan doesn't spin higher
[21:25:05] <gwern> and it's your own fault if you're using laptop or mobile or anything anywhere electricity consumption matters
[21:25:27] <PapuaHardyNet> that's right, its the user paying for the electricity consumption
[21:25:51] <PapuaHardyNet> its basically the advertisement method of making revenue, except ads are replaced by proof-of-work
[21:25:56] <Khoth> I think I'll just get the pdf from scihub instead, they probably have a better selection and I don't need to keep a browser window open for ???? duration before I get my pdf

[21:26:29] <nshepperd> this seems likely to be far less efficient than the user just paying scihub with some crypto directly
[21:26:40] <feep> yeah but we don't have an api for that
[21:26:42] <feep> that would be cool
[21:26:55] <Khoth> Who would go to the new weird shady illegal paper download site instead of the widely known and trusted illegal paper download site?
[21:27:06] <feep> to be fair
[21:27:18] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps it shouldn't host sci-hub PDFs then, maybe something else
[21:27:21] <feep> I also thought nobody in germany would use the new weird shady corona app instead of the widely known and trusted corona app
[21:27:23] <feep> but
[21:27:32] <feep> that is the world in which we live
[21:27:52] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, I actually have stopped expecting sensible actions from people by now
[21:28:15] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps a decentralized archive of data then, not just sci-hub
[21:28:32] <PapuaHardyNet> the bigger the data you want to download, the more proof-of-work the end user needs to submit
[21:28:47] <PapuaHardyNet> it's still morally ethical in my mind

[21:28:59] <PapuaHardyNet> nano
[21:29:02] <feep> I think you have reinvented s3 :p
[21:29:26] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: no, let me give you an example
[21:30:52] <PapuaHardyNet> let's say you want a rare album that is on REDACTED and you don't have a REDACTED account. This same album is now on shitcoinhub, uploaded by a user. Since the album is 500MB, your Ryzen needs to hash only for 10 minutes before you can freely download it from my servers.
[21:31:08] <PapuaHardyNet> I get paid, storage provider gets paid, uploader gets paid
[21:31:13] <PapuaHardyNet> you get your rare album
[21:31:16] <PapuaHardyNet> everyone wins
[21:31:32] <gwern> incidentally, at the conference I sketched an idea for a 'CO2coin'. essentially, the mineralization approach to CO2 removal should be auditable: you can just send someone out to a specific GPS coordinate, dig up whatever they're standing on, and go 'yep, that's olivine gravel/sand'. olivine captures CO2 naturally, scale to gigatonnage, is surprisingly cheap, and the capture is essentially...
[21:31:38] <gwern> ...irreversible. then it's just a standard slashing game: people claim to have dumped X tons of olivine, collect a CO2coin reward to sell to philanthropists, put up a stake, and challengers call in auditors to spotcheck claimed olivine sand dumps
[21:32:54] <PapuaHardyNet> that's... that's a more useful idea than most coins
[21:33:24] <PapuaHardyNet> but it isn't decentralized, so it isn't a "cryptocurrency", now, is it? 
[21:33:46] <feep> going back to bed~
[21:33:46] <PapuaHardyNet> are challengers ensuring consensus and earning money for it?
[21:33:54] <PapuaHardyNet> gn feep!
[21:33:55] <gwern> no, it's completely decentralized. the only place you extend trust is to the auditor agency, and they can be punished by community forks to new auditors
[21:34:49] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm
[21:34:52] <gwern> the claimers just post messages with their X tonnage at GPS coords Y, the challengers can be anyone who is suspicious or has already checked themselves
[21:34:53] <PapuaHardyNet> it's sensible
[21:35:20] <gwern> the money comes from any philanthropist, or person, or company wanting verifiable offsets they can burn, etc
[21:35:40] <PapuaHardyNet> but wait, you can simply claim an unclaimed patch of olivine to make free money
[21:35:45] <gwern> not as sand
[21:35:58] <gwern> olivine exists as huge deposits, but as solid slabs of rock which can't react
[21:36:34] <PapuaHardyNet> oh, so when it is in the form of sand, it naturally captures CO2
[21:36:34] <gwern> that's apparently actually the main cost of this form of co2 capture: you can mine the olivine for very cheap, but then transporting & grinding it up into small particles is the expensive part
[21:36:35] <rmmh> gwern: olivine weathering really needs beaches too 
[21:36:39] <gwern> well, moisture
[21:36:44] <PapuaHardyNet> right, right
[21:36:55] <rmmh> It is the most plausible co2 capture I've seen
[21:37:05] <gwern> that was the mian objection, it's not entirely clear how you incentivize mpoisture provision if you aren't dumping on a beach
[21:37:26] <gwern> I didn't know enough about the water contribution to know how serious that is or if there's any small tweak to fix that
[21:37:37] <rmmh> wave weathering multiplies the effective capture a bunch too
[21:39:06] <gwern> but I came up with it mostly to prove to jed mccaleb that you *can* come up with a co2coin. no one there could answer his question 'but how does the blockchain *know* about CO2 in the real world?' which is of course the basic question about any of these, and you just need to find a CO2 method that fits inside known economic games
[21:39:49] <PapuaHardyNet> how about a 51% attack where claimers and challengers collude?
[21:39:57] <PapuaHardyNet> s/how/what
[21:39:57] <rmmh> 1) usdt is "worth" something 2) usdt auditing is atrocious 3) therefore, co2coin is plausible 
[21:40:14] <gwern> hehe
[21:41:49] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: that would set up a race for other challengers to frontrun the collusion and get their challenge out first. I think many of these designs also burn some fraction to make various kinds of wash or circular trades unprofitable? but the last resort of community forks may be enough to discourage that too

[22:15:24] <gwern> I ate at planet hollywood manhattan once in like 2010 or something, and I was deeply unimpressed. I had no idea there was a time it was actually seriously cool
[22:16:11] * gwern mostly just wondered how they got all the very expensive memorabilia. apparently the answer is 'planet hollywood *made* memorabilia expensive by buying it all up, and then had to farm it organically'
[22:16:58] <Logos01> The actually moving part will without question be deeply stressful but I'm planning on hiring a moving company that also does the packing and unpacking for you which will get me like 95% of the way done once I have the new lease.
[22:17:17] <kuudes> that sounds reasonable
[22:17:42] <Khoth> I ate at one once as a kid, I had no idea they were supposed to be cool
[22:17:47] <kuudes> I tried to solve things by throwing money at them and that seems to have been a good idea - source: I have moved a couple of times

[22:29:31] <kuudes> indeed
[22:29:41] <kuudes> oh, btw, would she be good in aiding you in this mental situation?
[22:30:47] <Logos01> Nooooott... really.  Though I *have* been texting with her.
[22:31:03] <Logos01> (She's at her BF's place while in recuperation so I haven't really seen her.)
[22:31:25] <Logos01> But sympathy isn't really a thing I can expect from her in any appreciable sense.
[22:31:55] <kuudes> indeed, but is sympathy a thing you need?
[22:32:24] <Logos01> Not really much else she can really *do* at the moment.  I've told her that if she finds any recommendations to send them my way.
[22:33:20] <kuudes> ok
[22:33:22] <Logos01> kuudes: Back before she became domme she was also my gf. We broke up and she moved out for a couple of years and then she had a bad breakup and needed a place. So I let her rent my basement for cheap because I wouldn't ever have to actually interact with her.
[22:33:56] <kuudes> indeed
[22:34:09] <Logos01> And it wasn't really a "I hate you you betrayed me and poisoned my goldfish you whore!" sort of breakup. Just a... two aggressors and no recipients do not a successful relationship make.
[22:34:18] <Logos01> Not when that's, y'know, an important aspect of it.
[22:34:28] <kuudes> yeah
[22:34:38] <kuudes> what do you feel you need currently?
[22:36:05] <Logos01> Well I've got the car towed and I'm waiting on the estimate. Once I get that back I'll be able to know how long it'll be before I have my car working again. Once I have that I'll be able to actually do walk-throughs on properties and that'll be the initiator on me putting up applications on leases.
[22:36:42] <Logos01> Hrm... she just asked me if I'd be okay with both her and her BF moving in, which would certainly defray the costs further which helps.

[22:57:10] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: this is a debate we've had before, but this doesn't really seem to be brutalist in the sense of 'exposing the raw structural elements' - a HTML page with sections is *not* made of `### Section Name`, it's made of `<section><h2>Section Name</h2></section>` or whatever. it's like if you had a greek temple made of marble... carved to look like unfinished tree limbs propping up the...
[22:57:16] <gwern> ...roof.
[22:58:19] <PapuaHardyNet> right, that makes sense
[22:59:16] <gwern> it's inspired by the examples which actually do expose the structural elements like that. like, the header will be indented and bolded and the text of that will actually be '<h2>Header</h2>'. that's pretty reasonable to call 'brutalist web design'
