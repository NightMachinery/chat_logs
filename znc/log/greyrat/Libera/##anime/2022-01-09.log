[00:01:19] <JesseDesu> so i give them kudos
[00:01:35] <Cryowolf> I don't think likes on instagram mean anything anymore. Most people forget they pressed like on something after 10 minutes
[00:02:02] <JesseDesu> i dont remember what i typed in irc as soon as i send it
[00:02:22] <Cryowolf> that's quite a short memory problem
[00:02:25] <JesseDesu> glue is not conductive right
[00:02:34] <JesseDesu> i need to fix the mic on a bluetooth for my helmet
[00:02:48] <JesseDesu> its loose, i want to glue gun it

[00:27:35] <DPA> I'm looking for a generic / boring isekai I haven't seen yet. Pretty much anything goes, I think. Just nothing like SAO, please.

[00:28:14] *** Joins: darkbot081 (~dbt081@5.139.102.193)
[00:28:18] <DPA> I guess I could watch that.
[00:28:56] <Urchin[emacs]> DPA: what's your specific annoyance with SAO, btw?
[00:32:13] <DPA> I don't really know. I kind of like when things have proper reasons, regardless of how realistic they are, unless they are just kind of random. But SAO, I just don't sea what's interesting about it. It just seams like it's doing whatever it wants.
[00:39:07] <DPA> I guess another way to put it may be, when something happens, it should make sense within the framework which is already known.
[00:39:47] <emmeka> DPA tbf, how much of SAO have you actually watched
[00:40:00] <emmeka> Alicization is legitimately good, even if you have to wade through shit to get to it
[00:40:24] <emmeka> but I'm not sure if it's boring or generic

[00:40:54] <MootPoot> hmm
[00:40:57] <MootPoot> idk about that
[00:41:01] <DPA> I've only seen a few episodes.
[00:41:33] <MootPoot> Alicization is like..well. Every other SAO arc except with maybe some extra team battles and better animation
[00:41:51] <ButterNoodle> yea alicization is the clannad afterstory of sao..
[00:41:52] <MootPoot> good braindead anime but I never thought I'd see the day where emmeka called SAO good
[00:42:09] <emmeka> you haven't spoken with me on the subject, then
[00:42:28] <MootPoot> Alicization turned SAO from "braindead anime" to "anime that you'll remember for a season but is still braindead"
[00:42:28] <ButterNoodle> like emmeka said.. sometimes u have to eat through a lot of shit to get to the pretty pink ass hole of an anime series
[00:42:32] <MootPoot> lol
[00:42:41] <emmeka> MootPoot I unironically like SAO. I have ever since it aired. I mean, I acknowledge that it's trash. But it's highly digestible trash.
[00:42:49] <ButterNoodle> #metoo
[00:42:53] * MootPoot takes a swig of his drink
[00:42:58] * MootPoot coughs
[00:43:04] * MootPoot watches hell freeze over
[00:43:08] <emmeka> this isn't a new position
[00:43:26] <ButterNoodle> people hate it bc is poopular and predicable, but I for one like my hand jobs, blow jobs, and bowel movements on a schedule
[00:43:28] <emmeka> I've had plenty of fights here in ##anime defending SAO
[00:43:29] * MootPoot watches blank eyed out at hell, freezing over
[00:43:48] <emmeka> idk why you think I *wouldn't* like it, exactly
[00:43:57] <ButterNoodle> I got u emmeka, even tho I watch for the harem and a not the dogshit MC
[00:44:26] <emmeka> the good thing is that the writer realized that Kirito sux so everything they did later in the series minimizes his presence or outright removes him
[00:44:29] <Bco1981> cute funny girls
[00:44:31] <ButterNoodle> tbh in the tier list of dog shit MCs.. he's not at the bottom
[00:44:33] <MootPoot> lack of yuri, lack of any actually in depth character writing , standard shonen anime meta, etc
[00:44:44] <emmeka> ButterNoodle wanna know the most annoying part about it
[00:44:49] <MootPoot> or well - I shouldn't be so mean
[00:44:51] <ButterNoodle> yes pls
[00:45:01] <MootPoot> the characters are 1cm deep, not completley shallow
[00:45:03] <MootPoot> but they're close
[00:45:09] <MootPoot> ah well
[00:45:13] <ButterNoodle> I mean if u hate shounen and thats the excuse.. #thatsfinetoo
[00:45:24] <emmeka> so in the novels, there's precisely 1 of the Aincrad arc stories that wasn't adapted into the anime. It is called The First Day, and takes place immediately after Kirito splits up with Klein in episode 1.
[00:45:25] <MootPoot> I dont mind braindead shonen
[00:45:32] <emmeka> and it explains /all/ of Kirito's edgelordness
[00:45:41] <emmeka> it makes him make sense, as a character
[00:45:45] <emmeka> and they didn't include it
[00:45:51] <ButterNoodle> we talked about this
[00:45:54] <MootPoot> its just that its emmeka - the dude who wont watch a anime unless he has all the directors and voice actors and artists lined up in a row perfectly 
[00:46:06] <ButterNoodle> I wanted to read it, but cared very little about kirito anyway
[00:46:06] <emmeka> I'm not sure why you think that's me
[00:46:07] <Bco1981> MootPoot: as long as there is anime tiddies.
[00:46:15] <MootPoot> and dosen't like it when there is not a massive dose of gayness

[00:46:48] <ButterNoodle> yea
[00:46:58] <ButterNoodle> I love nipples
[00:47:03] <emmeka> MootPoot weird strawman, really. I don't even care about seiyuu all that much. And the thing about studios is way off base - you were the one arguing that knowing studios and people in the industry is irrelevant and you should approach absolutely everything blindly, which is ridiculous
[00:47:30] <MootPoot> > industry is irrelevant and you should approach absolutely everything blindly, which is ridiculous
[00:47:32] <emmeka> being cognizant of studios and creators doesn't mean I don't watch anything unless it comes pedigreed
[00:47:39] <MootPoot> wrong -
[00:47:51] <MootPoot> I never said that - I said multiple times this si just how I do it.
[00:47:57] <MootPoot> I never said you should do it like that
[00:48:23] <emmeka> sure, but then what's this claim that I "wont watch a anime unless he has all the directors and voice actors and artists lined up in a row perfectly"
[00:48:28] <emmeka> that doesn't sound like me
[00:48:43] <MootPoot> Sounded like what you were telling me as the alternative that I should be doing
[00:49:02] <MootPoot> brb
[00:49:59] <emmeka> no, I was telling you to maybe learn your shit instead of actually promoting or celebrating ignorance, like you were actively arguing against the idea that anyone should choose series based on the studios and creators that did them, as if it was absurd to maybe make KyoAni shows a priority or whatever
[00:50:23] <emmeka> and basically outright said that anyone who does this is a snob
[00:50:52] <emmeka> but regardless, I still don't get how you got from there to that idea of how I watch things
[00:51:27] <emmeka> MootPoot also you watched Alicization, right? There's plenty of gayness to be had
[00:51:34] <emmeka> Eugeo best girl, afterall
[00:53:53] <Cryowolf> The only arc I somewhat like, is the bullet one. Otherwise SAO is ass
[00:54:06] <emmeka> Cryowolf but did you watch Alicization

[00:58:01] <emmeka> ok well I'm not going to have this conversation again and don't really care right now, but I am still confused as to how you got this idea of what I watched
[00:58:03] <MootPoot> tbh at this point if there was, I've probably forgotten
[00:58:18] <Cryowolf> I mean, why would it matter how someone picks their anime? If they enjoy it and have a good time, then the whole goal of it is achieved

[01:03:46] <emmeka> MootPoot this is the opposite of what happened, though. I was talking about studios and you butted in to say how you never check any of that and watch everything blind on principle and then argued that anyone who so much as cares about studios and creators involved in a show is a snob

[06:29:42] <ButterNoodle> google it
[06:29:49] <ButterNoodle> bet u have a distributor near
[06:30:02] <MootPoot> Do they make any wifi ax stuff
[06:30:21] <mixfix41> the thing too is not thinking about network just have it stay out my way. my laptop will shut off on me if i move it and jiggle the power cord thats enough hardware id like to deal with rn
[06:31:37] <mixfix41> if you gonna get the mikrotik you need an access point
[06:31:55] <mixfix41> maybe your old router but i went with ubiquiti
[06:32:24] <mixfix41> and 2.7 gighz is slower but the range is improve
[06:32:32] <mixfix41> im happy with it
[06:32:42] <mixfix41> i aalready said this
[06:32:47] * mixfix41 goes away
[06:32:51] <emmeka> just checked the distributor I got my hap ac2 from, they have it in stock
[06:32:54] <emmeka> it's pretty spiffy
[06:34:01] <mixfix41> routeros is partly why its so stable 
[06:34:05] <mixfix41> pretty nice
[06:34:11] <MootPoot> 190$
[06:34:12] <MootPoot> expensive

[06:37:04] <emmeka> ButterNoodle unnecessary though. That AC2 has stupidly good antenna gain
[06:37:18] <MootPoot> ac3 is for 1 50
[06:37:23] <ButterNoodle> but MootPoot has a mansion
[06:37:24] <emmeka> I can get the 2.4ghz waaaaaaaaaay the fuck out in the field
[06:37:26] <MootPoot> 150*
[06:37:34] <emmeka> like, 300ft, easily
[06:39:20] <MootPoot> is the hap ac3 only 2x2?
[06:39:35] <ButterNoodle> idk
[06:39:38] <ButterNoodle> read the specs
[06:40:48] <mixfix41> you only use the mikrotik for wifi i think i have the same one
[06:41:01] <MootPoot> :\
[06:41:02] <mixfix41> im not sure i was having trouble with its range
[06:41:09] <mixfix41> and ive read the same too on reddit
[06:41:15] <MootPoot> seems like its only 1x1 or someth
[06:41:24] <MootPoot> max 5ghz speed is 867mbit

[06:41:52] <Sadale> lol
[06:41:52] <emmeka> actually, gimme a sec. I can tell you exactly how far it can go and still get signal, the lazy way
[06:42:03] <MootPoot> Well, that's not the issue for me
[06:42:03] <Sadale> 5G is here in Hong Kong SAR.
[06:42:08] <emmeka> measuring on google earth to a spot where I know it cuts out, lol
[06:42:10] <MootPoot> I have a repeater setup
[06:42:18] <mixfix41> well im cheap tho
[06:42:23] <JesseDesu> is it a 6 shooter
[06:42:24] <mixfix41> thats what i mean :)
[06:42:25] <MootPoot> My problem is mostly floors in the way - vertical coverage
[06:42:30] <MootPoot> not horizontal

[06:43:37] * ButterNoodle unzips
[06:43:44] <emmeka> answer: signal is fine up to 400ft, cuts off at about 450ft
[06:44:13] <emmeka> MootPoot how many floors do you have where that'd be an actual problem
[06:44:21] <mixfix41> Sadale: 5g with 4 UAP ac pro acess points
[06:44:21] <MootPoot> 4
[06:44:30] <emmeka> ....4?!
[06:44:32] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot might need more mimo.. he has power users
[06:44:35] <mixfix41> close to five hundred dollars in access points
[06:44:39] <mixfix41> emmeka: for 5g
[06:44:41] <mixfix41> i only have one
[06:44:49] <emmeka> wh-what does one even put in 4 stories of house
[06:45:01] <emmeka> that's basically a low-rise
[06:45:09] <ButterNoodle> one would hope lots of hookers
[06:45:34] * MootPoot resides on the 4th floor and needs wifi all the way down to the basement
[06:45:39] <mixfix41> depends, if all your electronics is 5g compatible, do eeeet
[06:45:46] <emmeka> do you need an elevator
[06:45:56] * MootPoot flexes thighs
[06:46:00] <emmeka> or do you just walk up 3 flights of stairs all the time
[06:46:23] <mixfix41> no but if you want to bring your whole electronic setup in the shed you could sit there and ponder life
[06:46:35] <MootPoot> oh
[06:46:41] <MootPoot> my router is still under warrenty
[06:46:48] <mixfix41> i mean i can do it now

[06:57:50] <ButterNoodle> another reason its shit
[06:57:54] <ButterNoodle> be compatible
[06:57:56] <Macer> that's a big reason for sure lol
[06:58:01] <ButterNoodle> and dont use stupid device names
[06:58:02] <Macer> they have mount_smbfs
[06:58:05] <Macer> which is ancient
[06:58:07] <mixfix41> or i  mean ubiquiti i just cant imagine using the mikrotik wifi
[06:58:10] <mixfix41> for the hap ac2
[06:58:10] <Macer> it only does ntlmv1
[06:58:15] <ButterNoodle> anyway...
[06:58:24] <Macer> mount.cifs is much better
[06:58:46] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: if u need more wifi get something else
[06:58:56] <Macer> either way though. i like fbsd. i'd use it as my go to if it could just mount smb properly. that's sort of a dealbreaker
[06:59:01] <Macer> and i refuse to use fuse heh
[06:59:03] <mixfix41> ubiquiti has range
[06:59:07] <mixfix41> get range

[06:59:32] <ButterNoodle> mixfix41: I think MootPoot just wants an all in one box.. so probably neither
[06:59:32] <mixfix41> even with a regular router add a access point and see
[06:59:40] <Macer> i have some netgear somethinghawk that i just use as a wifi bridge
[06:59:45] <mixfix41> no range then..
[06:59:54] <mixfix41> haha im glad im done with it 
[07:00:27] <Macer> Uptime: 214 Days 02 Hours 57 Minutes 33 Seconds
[07:00:39] <Macer> it seems to get the job done. heh. 
[07:01:03] <mixfix41> yeah i have a few i can play with now but its gonna gather dust for now
[07:01:49] <Macer> i wish all these somethingpi boards had dual gbit nics and enough support to be used as a router without costing through the roof
[07:02:11] <mixfix41> ubiquiti
[07:02:27] <mixfix41> its not about speed its about data stream
[07:02:28] <Macer> i have a ubiquity sfp+ switch
[07:02:36] <Macer> it really isn't that special heh
[07:03:02] <MootPoot> well tbh on wifi I only have a few devices which need that kind of speed, and any router can do that many clients
[07:03:10] <Macer> but a ubiquity router probably costs a lot more than a dual nic pi would if they made one that wasn't too expensive or actually supported being used as a router. i know someone makes one but it was a little costly for what it was 
[07:03:10] <ButterNoodle> yea its just a switch
[07:03:33] <Macer> i mean you're better off just building some miniitx 1u with a decent low powered intel 
[07:03:33] <MootPoot> But I also rely on the router to do all the routing for everything so
[07:03:35] <MootPoot> idk
[07:03:57] <ButterNoodle> yea it isnt 1999.. you dont have to use a spare PC for a router

[07:04:14] <Macer> it's in a nice looking rackmount case tho haha
[07:04:22] <Macer> it's pretty much the same thing you'd get in a router anyways. 
[07:04:25] <ButterNoodle> with a single power supply
[07:04:35] <ButterNoodle> and probably uses more than 5w
[07:04:41] <mixfix41> the analogies you can find on it sound different
[07:04:52] <Macer> hm. not sure what the D2500 uses
[07:05:16] <ButterNoodle> the rb-5008 is pretty nice
[07:05:30] <mixfix41> bridging may be the answer. though its more plugs you want to deal with good to save money but for range its just eye boulging can you get it?
[07:05:33] <Macer> ButterNoodle: i don't know. i've ran it for years so far without issue so i don't mind it

[08:19:44] <MootPoot> they want me to send the thing back then they'll mail me another 
[08:19:46] <MootPoot> god what a pain
[08:20:19] <Cryowolf> they should be sending you an RMA box though
[08:20:22] <Cryowolf> to send it back in
[08:20:32] <MootPoot> well, they said wait 2-3 business days
[08:20:33] <MootPoot> so
[08:20:35] <Cryowolf> and paid postal

[08:21:16] <Cryowolf> not even in the US
[08:21:28] <Cryowolf> falls under warranty
[08:22:03] <Cryowolf> regretting a purchase is another thing though, but something not working
[08:22:10] <Cryowolf> that they cant make you pay for

[08:23:19] <MootPoot> for seasonic they told me I had to send it to the US from canada
[08:23:27] <MootPoot> since that was their only location for NA

[08:41:47] <Sadale> wifi FTW
[08:41:47] <MootPoot> its the newer one
[08:41:50] <MootPoot> the RISC-V one
[08:41:54] <Sadale> oh. ESP32-C3
[08:41:58] <Sadale> That's not ESP32.
[08:42:05] <MootPoot> it says ESP32
[08:42:08] <MootPoot> ?
[08:42:32] <Sadale> Just for avoiding confusion, please say ESP32-C3 instead. Otherwise people'd assume that it's the classic ESP32
[08:42:49] <Sadale> I'm considering using the ESP32-C3 for my portable game console. But that project is in line and I have to work on the clock first
[08:43:08] <MootPoot> isent that one the ESP8266

[08:45:14] <Sadale> The clock? Yes. The clock is ESP8266.
[08:45:26] <Sadale> The game console will possibly be ESP32-C3.
[08:45:39] <MootPoot> no I mean the ESP32 that everyone calls a ESP32 is actually a ESP8266
[08:46:25] <Sadale> wut?
[08:46:25] <Sadale> Not true
[08:47:00] <Sadale> ESP8266 is not ESP32. espressif has ESP8266, ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3 and new models of their MCU are keep getting released.
[08:47:27] <Sadale> ESP8266 is to be replaced by ESP32-C3 after a few years

[12:18:12] <sentionics> MootPoot: I remember my cousins studying interview prep books back during the junior and intermediate dev job hunting days. I've yet to read one, I've just been stupidly lucky all my career.
[12:18:38] <MootPoot> well, all the "code tests" or technical parts I've encoutnered are way too easy
[12:18:44] <MootPoot> in actual interviews
[12:19:20] <MootPoot> so I'm not sure if they chosse easy questions or if this level of job is too low for my skill 
[12:19:30] <MootPoot> but I can't represent it in my resume so what does it matter
[12:20:17] <MootPoot> I tried to get some recruiters on the phone but it seems like all of them just want you to give them your resume for free and you still have to apply for jobs manually - at that point what's the point of a recruiter
[12:20:22] <MootPoot> might as well apply directly
[12:21:12] <Neopolitan> Recruiting is basically just another bullshit job these days
[12:21:13] <sentionics> MootPoot: doesn't hurt to apply for intermediate level positions too. Also, the coding challenge part of my last job, despite being a senior position basically just gave me college sophomore level database and python problems to solve in front of the interviewer.
[12:21:36] <Neopolitan> If they aren't actually doing anything to help you, just skip them.
[12:22:50] <sentionics> MootPoot: I think the biggest part of what helps to sell it in the face of weak tests like that, is to sell your proficiency with your editor of choice, and show good coding styling. Show them how you thing, revise variable names as you go to make them better, and speak aloud what you're doing and thinking as you go through it.
[12:23:31] <MootPoot> seems like the old days of recruiters where they asked you and then found a job for you is gone
[12:24:15] <MootPoot> either that or they dont care becuae entry level jobs dont get them enough comission
[12:24:33] <sentionics> MootPoot: Well, it probably depends on your location. Over here in the US, there's some recruiting agencies that aren't bad. But of course, when you reach senior level, you're a hot commodity so they're all over you.
[12:26:00] <sentionics> We've our share shit recruiting agencies, and directly applying is probably ideal. But if you're lazy like me, you just goof around until some recruiter cold calls/emails/messages you on linkedin you, and asks if you're interested in <x> position.
[12:26:30] <sentionics> That's how I got my last job. I wasn't really looking. But I was like, sure, put my name in for those. Got the interview, got the job.
[12:27:08] <MootPoot> I guess, I put my name down in all the places I could fine
[12:27:10] <MootPoot> find*
[12:27:10] <sentionics> Hated the job, got myself fired a few days ago, and now I'm back to being lazy and free.
[12:28:19] <sentionics> MootPoot: beware though. If a recruiter pushes your name as a candidate to a company, and then you directly apply, that company may be legally obligated to ignore your direct application and go through the recruiter.
[12:28:26] <sentionics> Not sure how it is in Canada.
[12:29:16] <MootPoot> well, for today I just want to get a job and have a normal pay
[12:29:24] <MootPoot> hold it for a year or something then bail
[12:29:54] <sentionics> MootPoot: Your strategy must therefore be, hit the junior and intermediate positions, and line up those interviews as much as you can.
[12:30:56] <sentionics> At the junior level, competition actually sucks really bad, so it's hard to land them. Intermediate isn't as bad. Senior level, well, companies are practically salivating for senior level devs.
[12:32:14] <sentionics> MootPoot: try to find and pick up clients for freelance work if you can, they can pad your resume, and you can include that in your "years of experience" claim.
[12:32:45] <ButterNoodle> I'ma try to suck my own dick and go to bed
[12:34:05] <sentionics> Hard to do, tbh. But sometimes, you get lucky and happen to know/meet someone who needs a website made or whatever. Don't undersell yourself, be upfront and charge what your worth. Don't charge fixed price for an entire freelance project (that's asking for a hell you don't want to know).
[12:34:34] <sentionics> fixed price is fine for clearly defined milestones. Anything extra is an additional time evaluation.
[12:35:35] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Boruto: Naruto Next Generations | Episode: 231
[12:35:52] <sentionics> For freelance, remember, you're not working as just a developer, but as a business more or less. So you charge like you're doing business. If you're dev rate is 25, you better at least charge 50.
[12:42:08] <MootPoot> for freelance didnt everyone just flood the market with stuff like fiverr
[12:42:37] <MootPoot> the stories I've heard of people freelancing are people who used to work for a bunch of companies that they have a reputation with
[12:42:40] <sentionics> MootPoot: clients who go for cheap online labor like that tend to get what they pay for.
[12:44:02] <sentionics> MootPoot: That said, places like the r/forhire subreddit used to be decent. Hell, I remember landing a few clients off of elance (now known as upwork) back in my college days 10 years ago.
[12:45:55] <sentionics> I doubt things work out nearly so easily with online sources anymore. If you have a compelling portfolio, you might can get lucky making a [forhire] post on the appropriate forums.
[12:47:11] <PancakeMatsuri> Upwork averages at about $30
[12:47:23] <sentionics> From what I've heard, you need to carve out a bit more of a specific niche you cater to (restaurant websites maybe?) and tailor portfolios specific to the niches you want to advertise on.
[12:48:20] <sentionics> clients often aren't tech-savvy so they may have no idea what even javascript is, so rather than sell your techstack, sell what you can make for them.

[13:00:15] <sentionics> MootPoot: Big thing about freelance though, if you do land a client... you gotta see it through very seriously. It's not a college project you goof off on and try to finish at the last minute. I've burned a few bridges with this mentality when I was younger, so definitely do beware if you go for it. A satisfied client can make for a great job reference too if nothing else, plus sometimes you get really lucky and they either

[16:16:58] <Sadale> true
[16:17:03] <Sadale> But still
[16:17:06] <Satin> i just have to look at the keyboard and type

[18:04:12] <isekaijin> Sadale: Does that mean “Cantonese language”?
[18:04:49] <isekaijin> Sadale: The Jyutping version is vaguely similar to “guangdonghua” in Mandarin.
[18:10:36] <Sadale> isekaijin, yep. It does mean Cantonese language.
[18:10:42] <Sadale> gwongdungwa. :3
[18:11:51] <isekaijin> I like the idea of randomly associating Latin alphabet letters to sounds, to troll native speakers of languages written using the Latin alphabet.
[18:12:49] <isekaijin> Bonus points if you can back your design decision with arguments like “my spellings are shorter, so they're more convenient”.
[18:13:01] <isekaijin> Like the idea behind APL, but applied to natural languages.

[18:14:42] <ImoutoBot> [title] APL (programming language) - Wikipedia
[18:15:01] <darkwitch> it's all a sticky mess of sounds
[18:15:45] <isekaijin> “A sticky mess of sounds” is literally how English sounds to me.
[18:16:03] <isekaijin> I got used to it, but it's still a mess.
[18:18:08] <darkwitch> every individual adds their little flair to it, be it a dialect, accent or their own personal oddity
[18:18:24] <darkwitch> it tends to have little in common with the written language
[18:21:41] <isekaijin> It's more the fact that some sounds blur the distinction between consonant and vowel, like “r” (this one is even worse in German) or “w”.
[18:23:01] <darkwitch> what you write as 'r' can be spoken in near infinite number of ways
[18:23:55] <Satin> okay vim is usable.
[18:24:09] <Satin> Even if I basically go up and down with my right hand for hjkl.
[18:24:47] <Satin> my K goes up and my J goes down
[18:25:12] <Satin> !seen mootpoot
[18:25:12] <ImoutoBot> Satin: mootpoot was last seen in ##anime 4 hours and 25 minutes ago: <MootPoot> Yeah, I guess
[18:25:49] <darkwitch> k goes up and j goes down?
[18:26:00] <HeTo> oh, if only j and k were swapped colemak wouldn't be that bad for vim hjkl
[18:26:04] <darkwitch> what does it all mean
[18:26:35] <HeTo> darkwitch: vim basic cursor movement commands
[18:27:04] <darkwitch> hmm, press the arrows?
[18:27:24] <HeTo> at least most other vim commands aren't based so much on the position of the keys, except ones derived from hjkl
[18:27:35] <HeTo> darkwitch: requires moving the hand away from the letters
[18:28:12] <HeTo> perhaps e for its placement next to w, but even then you can have the mnemonic *e*nd of word
[18:28:32] * darkwitch does not comprehend why people insist on using old and weird software
[18:28:55] <merced> i never got the hang of hjkl
[18:28:59] <merced> maybe one dady
[18:29:01] <merced> day
[18:29:22] <Sadale> lol APL programming langauge
[18:29:35] <HeTo> darkwitch: in vim, you can use the arrows, but hjkl are better because they are right where your fingers are anyway
[18:29:47] <Sadale> It's the one with all those weird symbols
[18:29:52] <HeTo> and usually other commands are even better because they move than one row or column at a time
[18:29:59] <darkwitch> it's good to move your hands around now and then
[18:29:59] <Satin> darkwitch: because this "old" software is very usable still, and useful
[18:30:08] <Satin> and much builds on it
[18:30:24] <Satin> in my case though this is happening because I use a different keyboard layout for two years now
[18:30:49] <merced> id use hjkl but having to move my finger to ESC to navigate is a no go
[18:30:56] <Satin> I was whining about the whole thing an hour ago because I thrown off by internet discussions about it sucking. Now that I've actually tried it, it isn't so bad. I can live with vim defaults, at least, so far.
[18:31:14] <HeTo> vim isn't that old even, first of all it's actively developed, and secondly even going by its first release it's newer than Windows NT or macOS (NeXTSTEP), for example
[18:31:40] <Satin> Yeah I hate the esc thing too but whatever.
[18:31:51] <merced> i like vim a lot more than emacs
[18:31:57] <HeTo> oh wait, the first release of Windows NT is later
[18:32:01] <Satin> The interesting thing is I'm getting into the habit of finally using caps lock on COLEMAK which is another backspace.
[18:32:03] <merced> but tbh nano is eeasiest
[18:32:18] <Satin> Normally even though that is a thing, I still reach over to my backspace but for some reason now I'm actually using it more often.
[18:32:18] <merced> Satin: lol that would drive me absolutely insane
[18:32:24] <Satin> why
[18:32:50] <Satin> You yell a lot or something?
[18:33:08] <Satin> I've lived without CAPS LOCK for two years now. No need for me.
[18:33:16] <merced> mostly that i always accidentally hit it
[18:33:19] <Satin> IF I WANT TO YELL I'LL HOLD DOWN SHIFT, YOU HEAR ME
[18:33:25] <merced> so instead of geetting caps id ddelete some coded
[18:33:32] <merced> god this keyboard is about to die
[18:33:34] <Satin> I SEE
[18:33:36] <merced> speaking of keyboards..
[18:33:50] <HeTo> Satin: esc is such an isolated key I have no problem hitting it quickly because I just need to hit something in the neighbourhood, but there are people who bind escape to caps lock instead
[18:34:02] <Satin> it's reaching over.
[18:34:06] <merced> oh that's smart
[18:34:07] <Satin> It's more movement.
[18:34:18] <Satin> I guess I could look into remapping that.
[18:34:19] <merced> even though i wanna use caps sometimees when im edditing baash
[18:34:26] <Satin> Actually. What I could do is change ESC to backspace.
[18:34:36] <merced> XD
[18:34:41] <Satin> and leave CAPSLOCK as backspace for myself.
[18:34:42] <HeTo> I usually press esc when I'm done writing and I'm thinking of something anyway
[18:34:59] <Satin> Yeah well, ESC seems to be vital to changing modes in Vim.
[18:35:07] <merced> <ESC><ESC><ESC>:wq is a huge part of my muscl ee memory workflow at this point
[18:35:19] <HeTo> so it's not so bad it's a little further away. gives some pacing anyway
[18:35:33] <Satin> meh
[18:35:35] <Satin> I don't like it
[18:35:36] <Satin> I don'
[18:35:39] <Satin> t
[18:35:42] <Satin> want to reach over for esc
[18:35:48] <Satin> if I'm going to use it that often
[18:36:16] <HeTo> also, I probably use ^W more often than backspace
[18:36:20] <Satin> Man this backspace to esc idea is perfect. Time to see how complicated it is to do on Linux.
[18:36:26] <Satin> and Windows as well.
[18:36:50] <Satin> I installed an accompying setup file from the COLEMAK site, or I do on all my Windows installs in order to make the caps lock a backspace.
[18:37:02] <HeTo> by the time I see a typo, chances are it's further away than just one or two characters, so might as well go and rewrite the whole word
[18:37:44] <Satin> So you edit this shit in xkb something huh hmmmmm
[18:40:03] <merced> my keyboard is nice
[18:40:13] <merced> i flip a dip switch and i can remap my keys at HW leevle

[18:40:24] <merced> not this shitty macbook keyboardd
[18:40:25] <Satin> I don't think mine does that
[18:41:42] <HeTo> Satin: so how do you use vim? do you press esc right away when you're finished writing a segment or do you leave it hanging around in insert mode in case you figure out what to write next and decide to continue where you are?
[18:42:05] <Satin> former so far
[18:42:12] <Satin> I've barely been using it for 30 minutes? lol
[18:42:15] <Satin> was doing the vim tutor thing
[18:42:20] <Satin> vimtutor*
[18:42:37] <HeTo> oh, well anyway, that's what I'd suggest you do, too

[18:42:45] <darkwitch> your discussion is a bit alien to me. I'm happy with my mouse and all the other keys
[18:43:16] <Satin> merced: doesn't work on COLEMAK
[18:43:19] <Satin> xd
[18:43:24] <Satin> or at least it's annoying rather y'know
[18:43:32] <Satin> WASD QWERTY is WARS for me.
[18:43:33] <merced> oh right yeah lmao
[18:43:42] <merced> that kinda sucks
[18:43:47] <HeTo> reduces the likelihood you'll be confused about what mode you're in once you return to it (it does show it at the bottom, but that requires looking there)
[18:43:51] <Satin> There's only like two games I've encountered so far that don't have re-mappable keybindings.
[18:44:17] <Satin> Other games automatically support COLEMAK or whatever, or at least I can remap stuff.
[18:44:17] <Satin> @ game devs, be sane
[18:44:25] <Satin> merced: most of the time it's not an issue.
[18:44:35] <Satin> but on sites like that one specifically with no way to remap at all, yeah uh.
[18:44:45] <Satin> QWERTY-centric world gross.
[18:44:48] <HeTo> does that game not use the letters but the keycodes instead?
[18:44:54] <Satin> I dunno.
[18:45:21] <HeTo> well, the point with that game is to learn vim commands
[18:45:36] <Satin> or
[18:45:42] <Satin> wait nevermind i guess it can work for me
[18:45:42] <HeTo> it should use the letters shown regardless of where those letters are on your keyboard to work properly
[18:45:53] <Satin> yeah actually it can work, I was probably mixing it up with another site
[18:46:08] <Satin> again, of course, i use it inverted but hey

[19:29:54] <TsundereNoises> I feel hella is the appropriate adjective here for some reason
[19:30:35] <Satin> TsundereNoises: I know! It's much better than before. I had lots of issues with discerning what to not take verbatim notes on and what not. And now it's a bit better with me being more picky, but still long winded.
[19:30:39] <TsundereNoises> Satin: this is making me want to find some of my old notebooks, like for math, but a) I don't know exactly where they are and b) I think I'd be embarassed of my handwriting

[19:30:51] <Satin> TsundereNoises: lmao understandable
[19:31:09] <TsundereNoises> also, anything taken during a college lecture, at least a big concern was getting it down fast enough

[19:31:16] <Satin> but here we are

[19:31:36] <Satin> s/style/approach/
[19:31:44] <TsundereNoises> high schools aren't so great at preparing kids at this, I had a few teachers who were
[19:31:55] <Satin> TsundereNoises: Yeah, but like, a lot of people with the amount of credit hours I've taken, have a method or approach they stick to generally, at least, that's my suspicion.
[19:32:08] <Satin> Then again a lot of community college, I didn't really rely on notes much.
[19:32:11] <TsundereNoises> Satin: but like, the semester I taught high school, a lot of the kids just had no fucking clue at all how to study for a test, and that was seniors
[19:32:15] <Satin> Just practice often, and glancing at notes.
[19:32:19] <Satin> TsundereNoises: Jesus.

[19:33:14] <Satin> It's not even impossible, but community college was too easy in many ways as long as I had interest and paid attention

[19:37:11] <TsundereNoises> Satin: so part of me wants to homeschool my eventual kids, and part of me thinks that's terribly stupid
[19:37:37] <mixfix41> after kintergarden so they can grow a bean
[19:37:39] <Satin> My stance has always been this: as long as you're actually doing it properly, I don't have issues with homeschooling.
[19:37:41] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I don't want them to be infected by notions of jesus or slut shaming though
[19:37:45] <HeTo> TsundereNoises: thought of the usual American answer and choosing where you live based on the school there?
[19:37:53] <Satin> The system is really broken in general and parents are just not held accountable at all though.
[19:38:09] <Satin> I suffered the worst brunt of that bit
[19:38:30] <TsundereNoises> HeTo: I've lived in places with better schools and moved away for reasons, and it's not really all my decision you know

[19:39:52] <Satin> TsundereNoises: Parenting is hard. I'm watching my Niece breakaway from her family and their control and what not, declare she's not really a christian, has an atheist boyfriend. As much as I secretly support her to be herself, part of me wishes she hadn't done it so abruptly to my step sister and her husband who've only tried to be the best parents. All of this to say, just fair warning that kids have that independence streaks.
[19:39:53] <TsundereNoises> I'm torn about whether that means she'll do less damage or not
[19:40:09] <Satin> Sometimes exposing them to the "bad" early on reduces that vs having an outburst later.
[19:40:32] <Satin> But anyhow, yeah. Homeschooling isn't bad and if you do go down that route, I'm sure you'll do 10x a better job

[19:40:41] <ImoutoBot> TsundereNoises: (218 / 276) <T​sundereNoises> I mean I honestly would love to have little kids that I could watch precure with <T​sundereNoises> but they better fucking learn japanese ASAP, because I'm not screwing around with that "Glitter Force" dub
[19:40:53] <Satin> lol
[19:42:07] <TsundereNoises> we worship madokami in this household
[19:42:38] <TsundereNoises> Satin: on the other hand, school as a means of not having to deal with your kids for 8 hours is a serious perk
[19:43:03] <TsundereNoises> I don't know, this is all enough in the future I'm just feeling weird thinking about it
[19:43:12] <mixfix41> just be aggressive more freetime
[19:43:22] <mixfix41> your kids will always stray away
[19:43:28] <mixfix41> dont listen to me
[19:43:32] <Satin> As thy days, so shalt thy strength be ~ some verse from the Psalms.
[19:43:44] <TsundereNoises> part of it is also my memories of 5th grade math
[19:43:58] <TsundereNoises> "oh, you're done, here, go work on the 6th grade math workbook"
[19:44:05] <TsundereNoises> which is the SAME FUCKING SHIT
[19:44:34] <TsundereNoises> but we're constantly understaffed on special ed, 70% of the kids are below grade level for reading (and grade level isn't that impressive)
[19:44:43] <TsundereNoises> so it sucks to be the kid who is kind of on top of things too
[19:44:47] <Satin> My homeschooling was incredibly mixed. In hindsight I wouldn't have it any other way, I don't really like how public schools and what not are run.
[19:44:49] <TsundereNoises> AND the kid having trouble, franly
[19:44:53] <TsundereNoises> frankly
[19:45:05] <mixfix41> do you scan your books tsundere?

[19:45:30] <TsundereNoises> mixfix41: I don't own a scanner and speedreading is bullshit, not sure which you mean
[19:45:39] <mixfix41> no i mean scanner
[19:45:49] <Satin> But it was painful. Dealing with insane parents that were controlling, isolating me completely, didn't grow up with friends. Religious prayer time twice a day, neglecting/downplaying education, adding to my own self image/self worth issues that took years and noticing my peers in community college on the same level or sometimes below me in school to shake that off and more.
[19:45:52] <TsundereNoises> mixfix41: I don't want to hurt the bindings, also why would I
[19:46:14] <mixfix41> its just one method
[19:46:17] <mixfix41> thats why
[19:46:22] <TsundereNoises> mixfix41: method for what though?
[19:46:27] <mixfix41> enjoying it
[19:46:35] <mixfix41> then you can pull up a page on command
[19:46:55] <mixfix41> kids would read more if they develop their own system foor this no doubt
[19:46:58] <TsundereNoises> mixfix41: I don't see how that makes books more enjoyable?
[19:47:06] <Satin> The positives were, spending time on the internet and what not just made me better rounded in general I feel. I wouldn't have spent so much time on IRC, the humanities, and other things I don't regret at all working towards in, technical subjects like science be dammed which I'm fixing now.
[19:47:07] <mixfix41> it would trust me..
[19:47:10] <TsundereNoises> but I also don't think I know wtf you're actually takling about
[19:47:20] <mixfix41> not the throw a scanner at them and expect that to work
[19:47:25] <mixfix41> but if they makeuseof the scanner thats how
[19:48:50] <TsundereNoises> for things where I want to flip back to a particular page (like a map or a list of abbreviations or something) I actually find physical books MUCH easier to use than pdfs

[19:49:46] <Satin> I'm getting better at using digital textbooks with fancy pdf viewers in linux like zathura. Now I just need to get better at notetaking and I'll have the "perfect" setup for myself. teehee
[19:50:30] <TsundereNoises> Satin: lately I've been weirded out a lot by people claiming they never write anything in english
[19:50:46] <Satin> hm?
[19:50:48] <TsundereNoises> Satin: like "when's the last time you wrote something instead of typing it" and they think the answer is years rather than "this morning"
[19:51:10] <Satin> They're not exactly wrong in some ways.
[19:51:17] <TsundereNoises> I mean they are for me
[19:51:29] <gh0s1> scribble notes
[19:51:33] <gh0s1> that counts
[19:51:35] <gh0s1> signatures
[19:51:36] <TsundereNoises> Satin: this is usually in the context of people arguing that typing but being completely unable to write is okay
[19:51:39] <Satin> I'm not surprised at all if many of them barely write except for signatures, random notes or whatever, and that's it. I can understand that not really counting much.
[19:51:41] <gh0s1> writing in tips
[19:51:54] <TsundereNoises> gh0s1: exactly what I mean, little notes to yourself, etc.
[19:52:15] <gh0s1> I do most of my organization with handwritten notes on pen+paper
[19:52:26] <TsundereNoises> <3 gh0s1
[19:52:32] <gh0s1> <3
[19:52:46] <Satin> TsundereNoises: I think none of the kids anytime soon are going to lose the ability to write soon. If your standards of being able to write are proper handwriting though, that's def declining and going to be seeing even more drastic declines in the future.
[19:53:07] <Satin> s/ability to write/ability to scribble-write/
[19:53:09] <TsundereNoises> but like I have a drawer of little bits of scrap paper and notecards with useless bullshit on one side that I use for when I need a random bit of paper for something
[19:53:13] <TsundereNoises> happens all the time
[19:53:33] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I'm not talking about nice handwriting, I'm talking about… the flipside of literacy I guess
[19:54:07] <gh0s1> oh my handwritings god awful
[19:54:10] <TsundereNoises> same
[19:54:16] <TsundereNoises> my handwriting is shit, but I can read it
[19:54:21] <gh0s1> I can. Most days
[19:54:22] <Satin> I don't think kids aren't going to have that anytime soon till schools actually stop teaching it. I also think that adults who claim they can't write like that to you are often exaggerating.
[19:54:39] <Satin> They might not actually properly handwrite, but they aren't forgetting it either.
[19:54:53] <gh0s1> They probably think "write an essay on paper"
[19:54:57] <TsundereNoises> Satin: the two contexts I've seen are people arguing schools SHOULD stop teachingi t, just typing, and re: japanese and basically not learning how to write at all and just only typing
[19:55:02] <Satin> gh0s1: exactly
[19:55:05] <TsundereNoises> Satin: which, by the way, I also find terrible for my memory
[19:55:07] <mixfix41> get on your art aprons its handwriting rescue
[19:55:10] <DunceCotus> the kurds are alright
[19:55:18] <gh0s1> that's random
[19:55:18] <Satin> DunceCotus: thanks
[19:55:25] <Satin>  /j
[19:55:40] <TsundereNoises> and no they don't, I never wrote much for essays on paper and I don't think we need that either
[19:55:47] <DunceCotus> kurdsburglar
[19:56:03] <TsundereNoises> I'm talking like teaching the 1st graders how to write letters shit (and idiots on the internet about japanese)
[19:56:14] <gh0s1> "Idiots on the internet"
[19:56:17] <gh0s1> never enough of those
[19:56:30] <Satin> TsundereNoises: The people who are saying schools should stop teaching it are just well, extreme. I also think they are the minority, or at least I would hope so anyway.
[19:56:51] <TsundereNoises> Satin: yes, but the argument itself infuriates me
[19:56:55] <Satin> There are people who don't know how to write at all, but they're rarer. Duck is one of them for sure, but I think he mentioned it was some condition or something
[19:57:02] <Satin> TsundereNoises: understandable
[19:57:21] <TsundereNoises> Satin: it's a subset, I guess, of the "I don't use math/shakespeare/history so we shouldn't teach it" argument
[19:57:30] <TsundereNoises> which is very prominent with parents and I think a pretty dangerous meme
[19:57:42] <TsundereNoises> since the point of school ought to be to prepare kids to have options
[19:57:56] <Satin> I think shakespeare/history aspect is more stronger than math as part of those bullshit ideas
[19:58:11] <Satin> the math is well recognized because of how dominant STEM is these days
[19:58:21] <Satin> it's harder to question
[19:58:31] <TsundereNoises> local parents are very down on math, it's why my hometown doesn't have high school calc anymore basically
[19:58:36] <Satin> meanwhile the humanities get plenty of bashing
[19:58:48] <TsundereNoises> not current home, the school I went to as a kid
[19:58:50] <Satin> TsundereNoises: I'd argue that's exceptional, but, I see where you're coming from
[19:59:09] <Satin> TsundereNoises: not to be too intrusive or rude, but this sounds like a particularly rural community?
[19:59:18] <TsundereNoises> yes
[19:59:22] <Satin> ok that explains that
[19:59:37] <TsundereNoises> Satin: my high school graduating class was 80 if that helps
[19:59:42] <TsundereNoises> which I think is not tiny
[19:59:45] <TsundereNoises> but I know isn't big
[20:00:10] <TsundereNoises> I had a few actually really great teachers in high school, but they've all retired and the district has gone to shit
[20:00:22] <Satin> Yeah I see. I'm not surprised then. I'm vaguely familiar with sentiments like that, but they're usually more rural for sure than anything you see anywhere else when it comes to math.
[20:00:47] <Satin> They probably have issues with the ways "most schools" teach things, have some degree of skepticism towards the school system, and how it's corrupting the youth's minds as well.
[20:00:59] <TsundereNoises> Satin: not so much
[20:01:10] <TsundereNoises> Satin: top 2 least religious states in the country, yeah
[20:01:53] <TsundereNoises> it's not the corrupting youths minds, it's the "I didn't like school and don't use anything I learned so my kid shouldn't have to learn it" attitude
[20:02:01] <Satin> Yikes
[20:02:03] <TsundereNoises> because anyone who uses their school got the fuck out of town basically
[20:02:17] <Satin> Yeah, that's just as shitty and often more overlooked
[20:02:21] <TsundereNoises> and now the school board are all people who mostly don't want their property taxes to go up
[20:02:27] <Satin> My parents were like that as well.
[20:02:48] <beaky> school boards like in great teacher onizuka
[20:02:52] <Satin> Well. Both of them did go to school and have degrees, my mom has an MA in English lit. Years ago. But my dad went to divinity school adn in general has a ditrust of school

[20:03:51] <Satin> TsundereNoises: Mind me venting about something or is too early in the day
[20:03:58] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I feel like my home state has it worse than average in that respect because of our idiotic tax structure, but that's another rant

[20:05:39] <Satin> I have never taken any biology classes in my life, but I might in the future try to minor in it since bioinformatics somewhat appeals to me as a potential career path, as a disclaimer.

[20:11:31] <TsundereNoises> Satin: although as I said, in my college immunology wasn't techincally in the bio department
[20:11:42] <DunceCotus> physics was hard in school so I gotta have faith people know wtf they're doing
[20:11:49] <TsundereNoises> Satin: and a lot of the kids who found the other bio type majors too hard did switch to bio, so there was something to it there I think
[20:11:57] <TsundereNoises> Satin: like just in terms of graduation requirements
[20:11:58] <DunceCotus> though the popular physicists tend to be skeptic fuks
[20:12:06] <JesseDesu> goos modning
[20:12:07] <Satin> TsundereNoises: how do you feel as a bio major who your physics peers look down on you as having a degree in an easier field in
[20:12:07] <emmeka> Satin it's a different kind of learning that the math kiddos don't excel at
[20:12:10] <JesseDesu> i'm tired

[20:14:35] <emmeka> like the truth of it is we don't *really* understand any of this at a deeper level, and most of the study of biology is fundamentally heuristic

[20:46:17] <gh0s1> Removing refueling forces cars to be more fuel efficient. So they can race with less weight
[20:46:30] <JesseDesu> that sounds like it would need an engine rebuild after 2 laps
[20:46:34] <Satin> 4:00

[20:48:08] <gh0s1> I don't see refueling coming back anytime soon tbh
[20:48:33] <Satin> yeah and i don't see any reason why it should
[20:48:49] <Satin> environmental one is a big one for sure in the long term
[20:48:57] <Satin> and fuel costs shit for everyone
[20:49:00] <gh0s1> they have a huge push for sustainability
