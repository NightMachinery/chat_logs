[00:00:31] <JEEB> it has its own implementation of HTTP, and then it can utilize various libraries for TLS. on windows I'd go with the schannel thing, which is the windows built-in TLS library
[00:00:52] <byte4byte> well i already have openssl built so im hoping i can reuse it
[00:01:04] <JEEB> and the windows SDK already has schannel :D
[00:01:14] <JEEB> but yes, openssl also has a wrapper but makes the result non-distributable
[00:01:23] <BtbN> schannel will get security updates automatically. Your hand-built openssl won't.
[00:01:37] <BtbN> I'd always go with schannel for Windows
[00:02:10] <JEEB> then if you absolutely have to have a not-schannel, gnutls is the thing that gets most testing out of the TLS wrappers.
[00:02:20] <byte4byte> ok
[00:02:26] <BtbN> Building gnutls yourself is A MESS though
[00:02:32] <JEEB> yup
[00:02:36] <JEEB> which is why I went with schannel
[00:02:36] <BtbN> it has like 5 or more dependencies, that themselves have dependencies

[00:41:22] <bencc1> https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/doc/examples/transcode_aac.c
[00:41:30] <bencc1> the first example decode and re-encode
[00:41:46] <bencc1> the second use an input fifo buffer, output buffer and resample
[00:41:55] <bencc1> why is the second example so much more complex?
[00:42:04] <bencc1> when do I need this complexity and when not?
[00:42:05] <JEEB> because it utilizes swresample instead of libavfilter
[00:42:16] <JEEB> you can also do the audio mixing stuff with libavfilter
[00:42:23] <JEEB> and it then has its own buffers etc
[00:42:43] <bencc1> nice
[00:42:52] <bencc1> can I dynamically add and remove inputs when needed?
[00:43:04] <bencc1> or will I need to create a new graph each time?
[00:43:13] *** ZucZero is now known as Zucca
[00:43:19] <JEEB> I think you would have to recreate the graph
[00:43:45] <JEEB> channel layout stuff should be change'able, but not necessarily stuff that requires more inputs
[00:43:48] <DeHackEd> unless you can do something with placeholder streams. depends on your exact needs
[00:44:11] <bencc1> let's say I need to mix up to 10 streams
[00:44:15] <JEEB> flushing a filter chain and re-creating it shouldn't take too much time
[00:44:37] <bencc1> I'll mix speakers in a conference so I'm not sure how frequent the changes will be

[00:45:28] <bencc1> every time I re-crate a new graph
[00:46:03] <JEEB> just flush the previous stuff from the filter chain and you should be OK?

[04:47:01] <k0l0r3k99> hey! Anybody knows sth about hardware encoding for Surface Pro X?
[04:47:14] <k0l0r3k99> (Windows with arm64)
[04:47:21] <BtbN> Seems unlikely
[04:48:17] <k0l0r3k99> In task manager I see it has SQ2 Adreno 690 GPU. Video decoding with ffmpeg works, but I can't use video encoding
[04:48:35] <BtbN> There is no Generic Hardware Encoding API
[04:48:46] <BtbN> Like there is for decoding via dxva/d3d11va
[04:48:59] <BtbN> So ffmpeg would need explicit support for that hardware encoder
[04:49:06] <BtbN> Which I'm pretty sure it does not have
[04:49:43] <BtbN> I can't even easily find any docs on how to utilize it
[04:50:33] <k0l0r3k99> So, the problem is that you can't find documentation to implement hardware encoding, right?
[04:51:45] <BtbN> Well, you'd also need someone who has such a device, and cares enough to implement a very device specific encoder for it
[04:51:59] <k0l0r3k99> I've surface pro x
[04:52:24] <k0l0r3k99> and I can compile ffmpeg for Windows arm64
[04:53:02] <BtbN> Well, do you know what API exposes the hwencoder, and do you know how to write an encoder for ffmpeg for it?
[04:53:24] <k0l0r3k99> nope
[04:54:34] <Hello71> my guess is it doesn't even support hwenc
[04:55:19] <BtbN> It does, it's on the spec sheet and MS even advertises support for it
[04:55:27] <BtbN> But no word on how to actually utilize it
[04:55:42] <k0l0r3k99> yep, there is hardware support for h264
[04:55:59] <Hello71> where?
[04:56:01] <k0l0r3k99> according to documentation & task manager
[04:56:41] <BtbN> It even has an HEVC encoder
[04:56:47] <BtbN> But still no word about how to use it

[05:08:39] <k0l0r3k99> We should ask MS for hardware encoding or qualcomm?
[05:09:17] <BtbN> That PDF sounds like it's about Linux, not Windows.
[05:09:38] <znf> both those PDFs mention linux and windows binaries
[05:10:33] <znf> or, rather, the "80-pc029-2_c_qualcomm_hevc_video_encoder_user_manual.pdf" mentions building ffmpeg with "libqhevcenc"
[05:10:41] <znf> (obviously, that's HEVC)
[05:11:03] <znf> it might not be the same SoC tough :P
[05:11:57] <BtbN> Yeah, if it works on that device at all, it's not at all public, and thus can't be included anyway
[05:12:25] <znf> all qualcomm does is usually only offered as binary blobs
[05:13:44] <k0l0r3k99> but this API must be in some dll in system32
[05:13:49] <k0l0r3k99> so it should be possible to search for it
[05:13:54] <BtbN> Good luck
[05:14:26] <znf> You can most likely find those files in the Adreno SDK
[05:14:38] <bittermelons> '$ ffmpeg.exe -f concat -safe 0 -i x.txt -c copy x.ogg'... is there anything that can grab me timestamps from each file in x.txt in order to add  chapters to the resultant .ogg?

[07:09:17] <MichaelB> Hello everyone. I'm trying to decrypt an audible audiobook to m4b using the following command:
[07:09:22] <MichaelB> ffmpeg -audible_key KEY -audible_iv IV -i book.aax -c:a copy -f adts pipe: | ffmpeg -f aac -i pipe: -i book.aax -map 0:a -map 1:v -map_metadata 1 -c copy out.m4b
[07:09:46] <MichaelB> Crap, I already messed this up lol

[07:09:55] <MichaelB> I'm using THIS command:

[07:10:30] <MichaelB> The output file seems fine on my windows machine. Metadata and cover are are present. But when I copy the file to my android device, the cover art isn't loaded. But if I pipe the aac stream to a new ffmpeg, then the output file cover art shows on Android.

[19:40:03] <SpeakerToMeat__> good day all.
[19:40:10] *** SpeakerToMeat__ is now known as SpeakerToMeat
[19:41:06] <SpeakerToMeat> Question, for some reason in one machine (this doesn't happen on a different one), when I burn subtitles to the image with -vf subtitles= the process takes a very very long while to start (like 5 to 8 minutes), but runs smootly and fast once it starts. Any idea why this could be happening?
[19:41:41] <SpeakerToMeat> the last message while starting and before actually running is "[Parsed_subtitles_2 @ 0x560150bba9c0] Shaper: FriBidi 0.19.7 (SIMPLE) HarfBuzz-ng 2.3.1 (COMPLEX)" "[Parsed_subtitles_2 @ 0x560150bba9c0] Using font provider fontconfig"
[19:43:01] <JEEB> you can check with -debug_ts if anything's happening in the background (it logs each read/adjustment/encoding/etc
[19:44:07] <JEEB> also which version are you on, out of interest
[19:44:38] <SpeakerToMeat> 4.1.6
[19:45:04] <JEEB> oof
[19:45:04] *** Quits: linjie (~linjie@58.247.210.251) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:45:35] <JEEB> anyways, the -debug_ts flag still may give you hints if it's doing anything, but that's already quite old :D
[19:46:04] *** Joins: linjie (~linjie@58.247.210.251)
[19:47:07] <SpeakerToMeat> JEEB, distro packaged one, I should probably update
[19:47:45] <SpeakerToMeat> it's gonna be a headache to get all the libraries I want for it, but yeah
[19:48:47] <JEEB> you can check btbn's builds for example?
[19:48:54] <JEEB> I think he now does linux as well
[19:49:02] <JEEB> https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/tag/autobuild-2021-07-02-12-37
[19:49:03] <JEEB> yup
[19:50:18] *** Quits: linjie (~linjie@58.247.210.251) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[19:50:31] <SpeakerToMeat> yeah but I better build myself because for example I want blackmagic integration

[19:51:44] <SpeakerToMeat> but don't worry, I un-cheered
[19:52:15] <BtbN> I'm actually impressed I got over 3k Downloads every day
[19:52:44] <SpeakerToMeat> I'm really happy you don't have to pay for those
[19:53:06] <SpeakerToMeat> Is there a list of compiled libraries/modules on the gpl and lgpl version somewhere? let me see if there's a readme...

[19:53:36] <BtbN> Those are GPL only
[19:53:52] <SpeakerToMeat> mhm
[19:54:14] <SpeakerToMeat> I wonder, if I want more stuff, if I can just fork and add what I want, scripts.d seems pretty straightforward
[19:54:29] <BtbN> Whatever could possibly be missing at this point? :D
[19:56:45] <SpeakerToMeat> BtbN, stuff that would have no interest for a general download or be easy operationally or legally to include. In my case, just the blackmagic sdk integration, for capture on my old intensity pro
[19:57:03] *** Quits: blue_penquin (uid505269@id-505269.brockwell.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[19:57:09] <BtbN> That's not included for license reason. It's non-free and thus non-distributable
[19:57:18] <SpeakerToMeat> Exactly
[19:57:33] <BtbN> fdk-aac is also in there, but not built for normal builds.
[19:58:12] <SpeakerToMeat> So no aac support? or no aac support via fdk-aac?
[19:58:18] <BtbN> No fdk-aac
[19:58:56] <SpeakerToMeat> Are there reasons why I would preffer fdk-aac to other aac en/decoders?
[19:59:24] <BtbN> It's the best encoder out there
[19:59:34] <SpeakerToMeat> Ok
