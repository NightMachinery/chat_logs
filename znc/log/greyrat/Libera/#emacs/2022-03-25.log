[10:48:31] <codingquark> Every time I try to fight with it, it makes sure to fight back and bite me
[10:48:38] <Xylon> when I have multiple windows open in a frame, and I open the buffer list, it seems to choose a window at random to open it in
[10:48:39] <codingquark> I have to _actually_ take care
[10:48:44] <Xylon> how do I get deterministic behaviour
[10:48:45] <parsnip> i'm not sure snakes are lizards now. researching...
[10:49:01] <parsnip> at least they are descended from lizards, i think
[10:49:15] <parsnip> but we are descended from bony fish, does that make us bony fish?

[10:49:39] <parsnip> oh, i missed the question

[10:50:46] <parsnip> there is shackle, which is a thin wrapper around the builtin emacs method

[10:51:13] <parsnip> there may be alternatives

[11:01:30] <parsnip> And even if they did, in what sense is it correct to refer to them as lizards.
[11:01:46] <parsnip> In what sense are we bony fish?

[11:05:39] <parsnip> aha, the term might be monophyletic vs paraphyletic

[13:52:25] <bkhl> A lot of people seem to think of it as light weight, but from what I've seen it's not that different from KDE/Gnome in terms of CPU/memory use
[13:53:32] <parsnip> doesn't kde and gnome pull in quite a bit of dependency?
[13:54:16] <parsnip> like, one could test apt get install {kde,gnome,xfce} desktop in docker, and time how long it takes to install each
[13:54:41] <bkhl> The benchmarks I was thinking of was benchmarks of "system load" in terms of memory/CPU usage
[13:54:51] <parsnip> like, if you install anything that requires gtk, it takes a while, one reason to install emacs-nox for example
[13:55:22] <bkhl> Probably rare to use XFCE without also having some GTK/QT applications, so not sure how relevant that is.
[13:55:55] <parsnip> lol, Forbes did a comparison
[13:56:35] <bkhl> As I recall KDE did pretty well in terms of CPU/memory use for a desktop environment.

[13:59:22] <Lumine> Wait, how can Xfce be heavier than KDE
[13:59:22] <bkhl> Some of the dependencies people complain about for Gnome I don't think contributes much to load though.
[13:59:24] <codingquark> When people want light weight, they do not go for tiling WMs or similar extremely minimal settings?
[13:59:37] <bkhl> Like, people might not like it depends on systemd, but it's not like systemd will have a massive impact on your CPU/memory use
[14:00:05] <bkhl> codingquark, I think there are minimalists that don't like tiling window managers necessarily.
[14:00:13] <parsnip> i guess KDE leaped forward
[14:00:21] <parsnip> maybe when they switched to QT
[14:00:31] <bkhl> But I think for them, lxde and stuff like that is the thing

[15:27:32] <parsnip> traits is how they add methods to structs?

[15:42:37] <bpalmer> one difference is that rust classes are not fully open; you can either implement (possibly external) traits for your own structs as they're defined; or you can implement local traits for external type after they're imported, but you can't make an external type implement an external trait
[15:42:59] <bpalmer> and to use the methods that are defined as part of a trait for a type, you have to import both the trait and the type.

[16:55:38] <bpalmer> As for reference counting ... some C++ types do support it (such as std::shared_ptr), but it's not automatically available.

[16:57:02] <mason0> hi. I have image links inside an org file, [[./path/to/img.jpg]]. if I put cursor on the image and press enter it is opened in separate window. but if I do org-display-inline-images, or org-toggle-inline-images nothing happens, I still see only the links. images are 400x300 or less
[16:58:57] <empwilli>  Spawns_Carpet[m]: you have to add smart pointers into the mix for the ref counting part, though
[17:00:09] <Spawns_Carpet[m]> Yeah for sure, but you are using smart pointers right??
[17:00:09] <fsbot> Don't count on it
[17:00:27] <artefact> smart pointers: we'll segfault your program, but do it smartly
[17:00:50] <empwilli> jup, i just wanted to say that there is no magic property that refcounts in c++ :)
[17:01:21] <artefact> doesn't c++something have shared_ptr<T> that does some refcounting on its own?

[17:04:13] <empwilli> I don't get a lot of the bad rep that c++ is getting though.. I mean yes preprocessor stuff is not that great and a more expressive meta programming language would be great, but other than that
[17:04:21] <empwilli> at least for more system centric programming I love it
[17:04:34] <empwilli> (i.e. OS programming and stuff)
[17:04:35] <artefact> it's bloated and has high-cost abstractions
[17:04:35] <mason0> empwilli I guess it does since it can display image in a separate window?

[17:04:45] <mason0> separate buffer*
[17:04:54] <empwilli> ah, ok; i guess then yes
[17:05:52] <empwilli> artefact: that's a 90s argument; yes you can build high overhead stuff, but in said usecase you should _always_ know the costs of what you are doing
[17:06:24] <empwilli> and c++ offers many abstractions that can be statically flattened so you don't pay much
[17:06:34] <artefact> yes, you should. and you should never use-after-free, or access out of bounds memory. it's hard
[17:06:59] * Spawns_Carpet[m] mutters something about rust
[17:07:27] <artefact> don't give any credit to my knee-jerk opinion. i've never written c++ for a real project
[17:07:59] <empwilli> indeed I think rust is a great language, as well; haven't gotten around to do much with it, though
[17:08:49] <empwilli> I for one think that many of the c++ adds too many abstractions doesn't hold and if you know a few rules of thumb modern c++ has more or less easy to use features that simplify programming (and offer type safety)

[20:13:55] <artefact> some terminals (eg. xterm) can remap input sequences to others, and you can do the opposite mapping in your init.el to work around terminals being full of legacy stupidness
[20:14:34] <artefact> i got C-backspace to work in xterm like that. then i decided to just use x emacs and save my sanity
[20:15:17] <artefact> with a little customize you can turn x emacs into a terminal-simile anyway
