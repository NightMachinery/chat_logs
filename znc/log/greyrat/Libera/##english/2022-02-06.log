[05:23:59] <LjL> Urawa: it's an adverb, and I don't believe there is an "adjectival version" of it. Although many adjectives can be turned into adverbs quite regularly, there are a lot of very common adverbs that don't have a corresponding adjective

[06:51:27] <Urawa> like not gettin recognized by everyone so fast or whatever

[06:56:57] <amigojapan> Urawa: hehe actually I am Mexican but I have lived 20 years in Japan
[06:57:26] <Urawa> what i later noticed, long after choosing that nick Awaru, is that it is pretty similar to Amaru, the name of Tupic Amaru, indigenous south american civil rights fighter & Tupac Amaru Shakur, who was named after Tupac Amaru
[06:57:34] <Urawa> however, this was not intended, at least not conscious

[07:00:32] <Urawa> like at some songs for example, which sound very similar to other songs, sometimes that much, that the interpret of the original song accuses the newer one of stealing from him, this can be cause the one who does the second song have heard the first song before, and, without the intention to copy the first song, or sound similar to it, let that from the subconsciousness flow into the creative process of creating the new song
[07:01:26] <LjL> amigojapan, do you often get randomly called "amigo" in Japan if they learn you're Mexican :P
[07:01:59] <Urawa> so it may be that, (i chose Awaru just out of my brain, like it just came out of nowhere so to say), may be that the subconsciousness took that actually from Tupac Amaru, but that wasnt intended though
[07:02:00] <amigojapan> Yep LjL that is why I chose this nick

[07:55:18] <TimMc> and the clerk may have been of Indian, Pakistani, or nearby origin.
[07:55:55] <pussipupu> maybe you happened to pronounce one vowel one certain way
[07:56:06] <LjL> or as i say, one vovvol
[07:56:13] <TimMc> What I said was "no, why do you ask?" and he gave some reply I couldn't make out -- I think something about there being a lot of Brazilians. But maybe I should have said "no, are you?" :-P
[07:56:19] <pussipupu> sometimes that's all it takes to make a spurious connection

[07:56:59] <pussipupu> Does w generally evolve to v in human languages or is it a coincidence that Latin and Finnic did that?

[07:57:37] <LjL> pussipupu, i wouldn't say "generally", but it's a very plausible evolution, you basically go from approximant to fricative. can happen the other way around too

[08:05:07] <LjL> heh, not really, i wouldn't say that
[08:05:17] <LjL> one is what English often calls "dark L", the other is... the other one
[08:05:43] <LjL> between back vowels you say the dark L, between front vowels you say the regular L that British English has in word initials at least
