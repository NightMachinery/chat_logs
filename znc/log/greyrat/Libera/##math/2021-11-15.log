[00:00:49] <mornfall> cheating be damned, the problem is that those people are a huge drag on classes later on; cheat their way through first semester, by second they struggle in class and slow everyone down with stupid questions and constant complaining that the stuff is ‘too hard’
[00:01:15] <mycroftiv> maybe we should just teach the people who want to learn and let the others live other lives
[00:02:05] <Z-module> I mostly did my undergrad math hw on my own, though a couple of times I did run some proofs past a friend on my dorm hall who wasn't a math major but who understood most  of what I was talking about. He helped me realize the hole I had in fully filling in Nagata's example of an infinite-dimensional commutative noetherian ring. That was one of my favorite late-nights ever.
[00:02:43] <mornfall> Z-module: yeah i don't think anybody has a problem with that kind of cooperation
[00:02:48] <jimbzy> I was going to take discrete maths this semester, but decided to drop it at the last minute because online maths aren't very good.
[00:03:00] <Z-module> I miss those days.
[00:03:02] <jimbzy> The learning software sucks, and the other students don't know how to communicate.
[00:03:16] <qergle> jimbzy: why isn't your school re-opening?
[00:03:20] <Z-module> and going on my own to Bourbaki and Jacobson to fill in missing details
[00:03:41] <jimbzy> qergle, My school is open, but it just doesn't fit into my life at the moment.
[00:04:03] <Z-module> and walking into Mike Artin's office to say, "Pardon the reference, but I have a question about artinian rings..."   (He was quite helpful.)
[00:04:13] <somiaj> As an instructor, I don't really care if students cheat in calculus (it will totally be obvious when they apply for a job, or try to move on other classes), except for the preception. I want students who work hard, struggle, but actually learn and maybe only get a C/B grade, to feel they did a good job and feel proud of themselves. So if they see someone do no work and get an A for cheating, then they may
[00:04:16] <mornfall> i'm just generally annoyed by students that sit through 3 years of computer science, then come to the state exam and they don't know what a relation is… or a vector space… or pretty much anything that you can't cram in 3 days
[00:04:19] <somiaj> cheat as well.
[00:04:21] <somiaj> so if you are going to cheat, just make it so no one knows.
[00:04:33] <mycroftiv> irc in the past few years has been my only chance to discuss math with anyone, when i was in college as a music major 25 years ago it wasnt what i was doing, i need to meet more mathematicians in real life

[00:25:32] <XCode> because of that we can embedd the source of the morphism into the target.

[03:35:59] <jmorris> memorye: can you solve it with that setup
[03:36:05] <memorye> And very importantly the door he chooses to open has to be intentionally NOT the one with the prize
[03:36:15] <qergle> sure, which is why on the show they allow the contestant to pick
[03:36:27] <PlanckWalk> Even if the contestant picks, they can be correlated

[03:37:18] <memorye> jmorris i am thinking about it
[03:37:21] <qergle> memorye: right, there are a few key assumptions, one of those is monty always shows a goat
[03:37:34] <qergle> if he shows a car it's sort of game over

[03:42:24] <jmorris> anyway y+2x=1 and B wins with probability x + 0.5y = x + 0.5(1-2x) = 0.5

[03:47:46] <adem> cherim: thanks, I'll see if I understand the approach
[03:48:01] <PlanckWalk> jmorris: You said that P(B wins) = 0.5 therefore P(A wins) = P(B wins)
[03:48:02] <memorye> no they arent really
[03:48:09] <memorye> i drew it
[03:48:14] <PlanckWalk> Those aren't exhaustive
[03:48:27] <PlanckWalk> P(A wins) + P(B wins) + P(draw) = 1
[03:48:29] <memorye> Within the case where A has more at n
[03:48:57] <PlanckWalk> P(A wins) = 1 - P(B wins) - P(draw) < 0.5.
[03:48:58] <memorye> there is a case where A has only 1 more
[03:49:00] <memorye> at n
[03:49:06] <jmorris> PlanckWalk: the game is totally symmetric at n flips
[03:49:11] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[03:49:12] <jmorris> n flips each
[03:49:13] <memorye> and within that case there are two possibilities
[03:49:20] <cherim> P(B wins) = P(A wins) + P(draw).
[03:49:25] <memorye> and one is a draw
[03:49:38] <memorye> the other one is A wins
[03:49:48] <PlanckWalk> jmorris: The rest of your argument was fine, but you flubbed the last line.
[03:50:00] <memorye> i like it though jmorris
[03:50:09] <PlanckWalk> P(B wins) = 0.5 is correct.  "so it doesn't matter if you play A or B" is not.
[03:50:49] <jmorris> PlanckWalk: you can apply the exact same argument for A
[03:50:52] <PlanckWalk> Nope
[03:51:01] <PlanckWalk> draws exist.
[03:51:26] <PlanckWalk> You are saying P(draw) = 0 for all n.  Think about that.
[03:51:32] <cherim> You can simply compute cases n=0 or n=1 explicitly if you want
[03:51:42] <jmorris> fuck ive been asking my question wrong
[03:51:56] <memorye> ok you should say
[03:51:58] <memorye> um
[03:52:02] <memorye> how should he ask it?
[03:52:24] <memorye>  it should be something like is B more than 50% likely to win
[03:52:28] <memorye> that would be good
[03:53:08] <memorye> or maybe he should make it some way that there are no draws?
[03:53:14] <jmorris> ok the question should just be what is the probability that B wins
[03:53:23] <memorye> yeah that would be good

[04:01:24] <PlanckWalk> The mathematical structure for finite things like that is pretty boring.
[04:01:29] <memorye> but it you ... oh is it just  multi armed bandit problem?
[04:01:39] <PlanckWalk> Well, not just finite but explicitly enumerated.
[04:01:50] <memorye> planwalk ok infinity
[04:01:58] <memorye> what do you have, regarding infinity and probability
[04:02:17] <memorye> can you come up with a scenario that is interesting and paradoxical
[04:02:26] <PlanckWalk> The rules of probaiblities let you determine whether the question has a well defined answer or not, given the constraints.
[04:03:09] <PlanckWalk> Most of the "paradoxes" are thinly disguised cases where there isn't enough information, and people just fill in with some unjustified assumption.
[04:03:25] <memorye> yeah , and maybe all of them are
[04:03:33] <frelleck> I agree with PlanckWalk's last statemnt
[04:03:36] <memorye>  but i would rather think about one that might not be like that
[04:03:45] <memorye> as opposed to one that we know is
[04:03:55] <frelleck> with the caveat that some of the paradoxes are just meaningless/not well-defined
[04:03:56] <memorye> well actualy maybe it would be good practice to find such things

[04:05:10] <PlanckWalk> Some of the infinite cases are more intuition-bending in that they really do behave differently from our finite experience.

[04:06:29] <memorye> i notice if i restrict to just blue hued lights , half of the time its bright and half of the time its faint.

[04:09:03] <jmorris> you should use the information you have about the non blue lights
[04:09:44] <jmorris> based on the current level of information
[04:10:00] <memorye> but should the other info matter too maybe?
[04:10:28] <memorye> suppose i can look back as far as you like
[04:10:34] <memorye>  and its always 1/2 for the blue ones
[04:10:47] <memorye> i mean real close to 1/2
[04:10:58] <memorye> and its real close to 9/10 in general
[04:11:18] <memorye> for all the hues combined
[04:13:06] <jmorris> i have no reason to believe that the events are independent without knowing the underlying mechanics of the machines
[04:13:20] <jmorris> so i would still bet it goes bright
[04:14:03] <memorye> well if it costs .7 to play and if you win on faint you get 4 ,and if you win on bright you get 1
[04:14:10] <memorye> then it matters
[04:14:21] <memorye> suppose you know the underlying mechanics
[04:14:31] <memorye> that the blue light generator is .5

[07:50:55] <qergle> yeah, i don't know what a paradox is but there are simple probability problems that lead even smart people astray....
[07:51:47] <qergle> for example, you have a bag that contains a marble (white or black with equal probability). you add a white marble. now you draw one and it's white. what's the probability that the remaining one is white?

[08:11:10] *** Quits: Leonarbro (~Leonet@user/leonarbro) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[08:11:42] <moose> What colors would you suggest? I am sure every single color can be perceived as offensive if you try hard enough.
[08:12:30] <tusko> The probability itself is dubious
[08:13:14] <moose> If you have a bag with two marbles and you add a white one and draw a white one, it's unknown what the probability of a specific color the remaining marbles hold.
[08:13:45] <moose> But that's not the original question.
[08:14:34] <tusko> whether a white marble should be drawn, given the bag presently contains 1 pink and 1 polka-dotted marble, is 50/50 irrespective of what happened on the last draw
[08:15:14] <moose> The question was that the bag contains a black or white marble. You add a white one. You draw a white one. What is the probability that the remaining marble is white?
[08:15:16] <XCode> Any algebraic geometer around ? I would like to discuss something cool I was thinking about.
[08:16:03] <tusko> moose, right. but the *actual* probability, to my mind, seems to relate directly to the population of marbles in the bag prior to a given draw.
[08:16:38] <moose> My initial thinking is that it's a game where each drawing is independent. You have either a white or black marble in the bag, that makes it a 50% probability that the marble is white. You add one. Now it's a 66% probability that you will draw a white one. You draw a white one, now you're back down to 50%.
[08:17:07] <tusko> Yes, if I understand you this seems most sensible.
[08:17:07] <moose> Drawing a white one has no impact on whether or not your odds are worse for drawing a consecutive white marble. It just means that the bag either contains a black or white one at 50% chance each.
[08:17:29] <moose> I think generally people are fooled by thinking of it in terms of consecutive draws.
[08:17:40] *** Joins: Ginalo (uid502518@tinside.irccloud.com)
[08:17:59] <tusko> I believe the 'correct' answer here, though, is that there is a 2/3 chance to draw the second white marble.

[08:18:40] <moose> The question isn't about drawing a white marble, it's about the probability of there being a second white marble at all.
[08:18:52] <tusko> However much I agree with how you described the *actual* chances for a discrete draw.
[08:19:03] <moose> Read the question carefully :)
[08:19:20] <moose> "What are the odds that the remaining marble is white?" is very different from "What are the odds that the next draw will be a white marble?"
[08:19:35] <tusko> I see, so it asks what is the probability there are two white marbles, given you only ever added two and then drew one?
[08:20:00] <moose> The adding and removing is there to mess with your noggin'.
[08:20:22] <moose> It changes nothing in the question and adds no hint, it is there purely to confuse you and mislead you.
[08:20:29] <tusko> The remaining marble? There are two marbles. If you drew a white marble they are {W,B} and had you drawn a black marble they are {W,W}
[08:20:51] <moose> Ah yeah, my bad.
[08:21:14] <moose> No, wait, that's not accurate :)
[08:21:26] <tusko> This seems like some form of the Monty Hall problem
[08:21:28] <moose> I am correct, there is only one marble remaining after you add and remove the white one.
[08:21:52] <moose> The bag has one marble, it's either white or black. You add one white marble and then draw one white marble.
[08:21:54] <XCode> I have a curious question. Essentially R-Alg is the co-slice category under R in the category of commutative rings. We can view polynomial rings as free objects in that category. I was wondering is it possible to completely generalize algebraic geometry by studying co-slice category of a particular object A in an arbitrary category C? 
[08:22:08] <moose> At least that's hoe the question was written :)
[08:22:14] <tusko> You have {W,B}, then add white for {W,B,W}, then you draw white {W,B}.
[08:23:19] <tusko> I see, so you have some marble then add a white marble, and then draw a white marble?
[08:23:39] <tusko> And you're curious about what the marble in there is?

[09:00:44] <moose> The question can be restated more clearly. You are given a bag with one marble that is either white or black. You are given a white marble. You add this white marble to the bag, which now contains a white marble and either a white or black marble. You draw a white marble. There is now either a white or black marble in the bag. What is the probability that the remaining marble is white?
[09:00:47] <moose> The answer is clearly 50%.
[09:01:20] <moose> Drawing a white marble after adding one does not increase or decrease the probability that the original marble in the bag was white or black.
[09:02:55] <frelleck> it was more likely that you would draw a white if the original one was white
[09:03:24] <moose> I understand the principle behind what the other guy is saying
[09:03:28] <moose> The question isn't asking that.

[09:04:07] <moose> I have a master's in health physics.
[09:04:19] <moose> I don't understand why your argument has now shifted to bullshit power plays on degrees/grades/etc.
[09:04:30] <frelleck> just making sure you weren't a child pretending to know math
[09:04:37] <moose> Fair enough.
[09:04:38] <frelleck> you get that here sometimes
[09:05:10] <moose> Right. I get the intent of the question and my argument is that it's intentionally misleading or poorly formed :)
[09:05:57] <moose> Anyway it's gone on for too long now IMO.
[09:06:06] <moose> Lets build a simulation.
[09:06:34] <frelleck> go for it
[09:07:23] <jmorris> moose: the answer is clearly not 50%
[09:07:38] <jmorris> if you draw a white marble then there is clearly a > 50% chance that the marble left is white
[09:08:21] <jmorris> its so clearly not 50% that i dont even think thats what qergle meant when he said what people initially guess
[09:08:30] <jmorris> im guessing he meant 75%
[09:08:33] <frelleck> no, they do choose 50 percent
[09:08:50] <frelleck> they think the adding and removing a white marble changes nothing
[09:08:55] <jmorris> oh
[09:09:01] <jmorris> i see
[09:09:01] <frelleck> so if was 50 percent before it was 50 percent afterwards
[09:09:31] <jmorris> yeah this is an elementary mistake
[09:10:04] <jmorris> also the question is perfectly fine
[09:10:12] <jmorris> there's zero ambiguity
[09:10:18] <frelleck> if you had either 100 whites or 100 blacks and added the white marble, shuffled, and got out a random marble which was white, surely it's more likely there were 100 white marbles
[09:10:33] <moose> I disagree, if the intent is to say the question expresses that you draw a marble from the bag and it happens to be white.
[09:10:46] <moose> It says you simply draw a white marble, you remove a white one from the bag, unambiguously, every time.
[09:10:58] <jmorris> yes
[09:11:02] <jmorris> that is what it says
[09:11:17] <jmorris> whats the problem
[09:11:47] <moose> The problem is that the effect is identical to adding the same white marble and removing the same white marble.
[09:12:10] <jmorris> no its not
[09:12:12] <moose> If the question was "You draw a marble and it's white." that says something different than "You draw a white marble"
[09:12:40] <jmorris> lol
[09:12:43] <moose> Yes, I am being pedantic. But the question is intentionally formed to fuck with people.
[09:12:50] <jmorris> not really
[09:12:54] <moose> It's ambiguous.
[09:13:06] <moose> Only to someone who sees things one way is it not ambiguous... no offense.
[09:13:17] <moose> And in that case, you could be right or wrong, depending on who is asking it.
[09:13:38] <qergle> this is very common idiomatically. nobody objects to you take a die what is the probability that "you roll a 6"
[09:13:48] <qergle> nobody says that you roll and it happens it to be a 6
[09:14:19] <moose> Reading the original question it actually says it correctly lol
[09:14:31] <greenbagels> the problem is that a bag contains a white marble and a marble of indeterminate color with two equally probable choices
[09:14:38] <moose> I just noticed the question was posed different ways honestly.
[09:14:46] <moose> I will stfu now.
[09:14:58] <jmorris> well do you still think its 50%
[09:15:13] <greenbagels> qergle only phrased it in terms of sequential actions to make the physical picture more clear, probably
[09:15:15] <moose> I knew it wasn't 50% based on what I thought the question was.
[09:15:32] <moose> I was just being pedantic about the phrasing.
[09:15:47] <qergle> the phrasing was fine
[09:15:52] <jmorris> 3:30 PM <moose> The answer is clearly 50%.
[09:16:31] <isekaijin> XCode: What you have described is essentially working with affine schemes over Spec(R), and you can generalize this to working with arbitrary (not just affine) schemes over S (again, S is arbitrary, not necessarily affine).
[09:17:11] <isekaijin> XCode: And, of course, you can work with arbitrary slice or coslice categories if you so wish, but then you have to give a good reason to call the resulting field of study “geometry”.

[09:50:07] <rindolf> mycroftiv: good luck
[09:50:22] <mycroftiv> rindolf: eh, im doing this of my own curiosity and interest, so its all good, its just mentally challenging
[09:50:46] <rindolf> mycroftiv: ah
[09:51:29] <mycroftiv> i started on pure set theory and dependent types a few years ago and managed to actually eventually understand Scott's proof that a measurable cardinal means V != L, and how to express a lot of things in Agda formalization, so this is extending that knowledge
[09:52:06] <mycroftiv> the connection between set theoretic logic and knot theory via braid theory in one direction and 4 manifold topology/knot theory is another is completely astonishing to me
[09:54:42] <mycroftiv> at this point i believe it is correct to say that you can express a specific infinite ultrafilter structure via a particular kind of infinitely continued physical knotting pattern that corresponds to a casson handle
[09:55:27] <greenbagels> mycroftiv: that +/- comment reminds me of this thought i had recently
[09:55:43] <greenbagels> that it feels like adults who never learned math "right" make it harder for themselves to learn it right
[09:56:02] <greenbagels> because they try to make too much sense of things that they need to just accept (since it's easier to brainwash kids with "correct" math facts)
[09:58:00] <mycroftiv> greenbagels: i agree, i often see people with an interest in math get derailed by wanting to argue their intuitions vs standard definitions, it shows up in this channel a fair amount
[09:59:03] <greenbagels> i think thats one of the most depressing things about when math ed fails
[09:59:11] <greenbagels> it becomes much more difficult to correct that as people get older
[09:59:30] <greenbagels> at least, thats how it feels
[10:01:53] <mycroftiv> i think people need more exposure to logic early. my grandfather taught me the game of making 'well formed formulas' with dice with arbitrary symbols and rules for what sequences of symbols were legal
[10:02:41] <mycroftiv> so it was easy for me to see that math in school was just a special case of this kind of game, with the goal of making the rules useful as a map of physical counting and arithmetic
[10:05:13] <mycroftiv> so all the places where people want to argue about how something doesnt make sense without any real grasp of the larger picture, i just want to say 'lets just play the game by these rules for now, decide later if you want to make up your own game'

[10:11:41] <mycroftiv> droid3: there are nondetermined infinite two player games, in fact you can make one with a nonprincipal ultrafilter

[10:11:53] <PlanckWalk> We both pick a natural number.  Biggest number wins (otherwise draw)
[10:12:22] <PlanckWalk> Each of us have infinitely many choices.
[10:12:29] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: usually players take turns picking subsets of some infinite set, with 'victory sets' defined, and the outcome of the game is who has picked a winning set after an infinite number of moves
[10:12:38] <isekaijin> Oh, infinitely many choices, rather than infinitely many moves. I see.

[10:13:09] <PlanckWalk> Yes, games can be infinite in many respects
[10:13:15] <droid3> mycroftiv i know infinite games in general there is no minimax theory for mix strategies like you got with finite games. Because you can have distribution functions that are not continuous and thus makes the expected value integrals strict
[10:13:17] <mycroftiv> these infinite games correspond to principles in descriptive set theory actually
[10:13:28] <mycroftiv> and correlate to large cardinal axioms
[10:13:56] <mycroftiv> determinacy for a certain variety of infinite games == all sets of reals of a certain complexity are 'nice' == various large cardinals exist
[10:14:06] <droid3> But i wasnt sure if an infinite game that was zero sum and perfect information had such a minimax / saddle point/ nice game value situation? Have any examples

[10:14:20] <mycroftiv> https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/large-cardinals-determinacy/
[10:14:26] <PlanckWalk> Every option is dominated by some other option
[10:15:30] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: That looks to me like an artifact of logic (where you can arbitrarily decide the rules), rather than necessary geometric knowledge (where, if you cannot prove the theorems you want, then the problem is with the rules).

[10:17:02] <droid3> ok so what would be an example of a infinite game that is zero sum and one that is nonzero sum.  Have any good examples? In the case of finite chess ,checkers, ...etc are all zero sum and finite. And finite nonzero sum would be say a cooperative game where a loss for one doesnt make a win for another or visa-versa
[10:18:07] <droid3> But i cannt think of examples when it comes to infinite game case. I am just studying these types of games more rigourously i have always in the passed focused just mathematically on finite games / finite payoff matrices ...etc
[10:18:26] <droid3> Now i am getting more into the other half aka the infinite game analysis.
[10:19:03] <greenbagels> what if you take planckwalk's example of natural number guessing
[10:19:07] <droid3> This is usually thru integrals of functions over [0,1] interval with distribution
[10:19:17] <greenbagels> but instead of biggest one wins, both players win if d(n,m) < 10 ?
[10:19:18] <PlanckWalk> Take my game, but now you win if the sum of numbers we pick is even, I win if it's divisible by 3.

[13:05:00] <isekaijin> Errr, my question is not well posed. Let S1 and S2 be copies of the real line equipped with different smooth structures. For simplicity, we represent the smooth structure on each Si as the family of global diffeomorphisms R -> Si, where R is the real line with the standard smooth structure. Now, since S1 and S2 have the same underlying set, we may consider the smooth structures as sets of continuous

[14:51:20] <PlanckWalk> Simplar: Your function isn't just a^f(x) + a^g(x).  It's a^f(x) + a^f(b-x)
[14:51:47] <Simplar> PlanckWalk: what does it change?
[14:53:02] <PlanckWalk> Derivative of f(b-x) is pretty closely related to derivative of f(x)
[14:53:23] <PlanckWalk> But those of f(x) and g(x) are generally completely unrelated
[14:53:33] *** Quits: Xenolithic (~Xenolithi@user/xenolithic) (Quit: Client closed)
[14:54:15] <PlanckWalk> You could also write it as e^f(x) + e^f(b-x) for slightly different f
[14:54:36] <Simplar> Okay, so far I see that it just complicated stuff even more.
[14:55:11] <cherim> It simplifies work somewhat, you can reduce to proving monotonicity intervals for (a^f(x))'
[14:55:13] <PlanckWalk> If you're trying to find some critical points, it makes it much easier

[14:56:38] <PlanckWalk> So you get critical points when  e^f(x) f'(x) = e^f(b-x) f'(b-x)
[14:57:04] <PlanckWalk> In this form there's one really obvious critical point.

[14:59:56] <PlanckWalk> You could say it depends upon those definitions, but really in this case you could just say no.
[15:01:01] <PlanckWalk> Since the broader context tells you that for any of the general meanings for "europe", none of them have a country labelled "japan" in them.

[15:06:19] <user51> i mean, the previous textbook was an introduction to logic, and my teacher repeatedly said to think in class, but then also said he "doesn't know" about a not-totally-formal answer
[15:07:01] <user51> i'm probably just being pedantic. maybe i'm just stuck thinking bottom-up.
[15:07:10] <Simplar> PlanckWalk: critical points are points where function changes its slope?
[15:07:19] <Simplar> and decreases if increased before
[15:07:20] <int-e> riv: huh? it's a perfectly fine specification of a class that happens to be a set
[15:07:29] <Simplar> or increasing if decreased before
[15:07:37] <PlanckWalk> Simplar: points where the derivative is zero
[15:07:54] <riv> lol
[15:08:00] <PlanckWalk> For a differentiable function on an open set, every local minimum or maximum is a critical point
[15:08:26] <PlanckWalk> (If there are any)
[15:08:59] <PlanckWalk> The reverse isn't true though, not all critical points are local minima or maxima
[15:09:05] <user51> int-e: i'll agree that it's a bit of a trollish question. but i do wonder if i'm just not thinking right about this.

[15:09:35] <riv> there's multiple bad things about the question user51, you're not wrong

[17:56:16] <rex_victor> It's kind of hard doing an exercise, if you don't even know what the question is :)
[17:58:34] <Z-module> They secretly switched you over to the Dysfunctional Analysis course.
[17:58:44] <rex_victor> ok in the script there is an proof of those equalities (but without mentioning what they mean) and they end with "showing the asserted density"
[17:58:49] <rex_victor> Z-module: :D
[17:59:11] <[itchyjunk]> do they give the name of theorem or somesuch?
[17:59:55] <rex_victor> No name, but it's about the sequence spaces. The other statements in the theorem are very common
[18:00:18] <rex_victor> c_{00} ⊂ l^1 ⊂ l^p ⊂ l^q ⊂ c_0 ⊂ l^∞
[18:00:28] <rex_victor> this I've seen often
[18:00:43] <Z-module> So for the first one there, rex_victor, just take any element f of l^p and find a sequence of things in c_00 that converges (w.r.t. l^p norm) to f.
[18:00:45] <[itchyjunk]> What does it mean to raise a set to something in the first place? A^B means AxAx B times? googles says it means set of all function from A to B which makes less sense to me
[18:01:08] <Z-module> should be funcdtions from B to A
[18:01:14] <[itchyjunk]> oh B to A
[18:01:27] <[itchyjunk]> hmm interesting, never came across that either ;_;
[18:01:40] <Z-module> sometimes this is written with B on the left of A (a pre-superscript type of thing)
[18:01:55] <Z-module> It's just a handy object to have a name for in some situation, mostly set-theoretic
[18:02:01] <rex_victor> Z-module: thx, I'll think about it; now that I know what I'm supposed to proof :)

[18:04:09] <[itchyjunk]> oh.. i think i've seen that in my discrete math class ..
[18:05:00] <[itchyjunk]> that explains where we get that A^B notation from
[18:05:48] <Z-module> right, and for general cardinals A and B (including any infinite possibilities), we define cardinal exponentiation  A^B  as the cardinality of that set of functions.
[18:06:37] <Z-module> (which agrees with the usual numeric thing when A, B are both finite)
[18:07:23] <rex_victor> iirc there is another "reason" why we write A^B but I can't get it right now

[23:21:34] <rex_victor> I'm gonna take a break, maybe I find a way. But I shall return later with algebra :)
[23:21:52] <riv> hi
[23:21:55] <GomJabbar> i have a unit sphere centered at the origin and an arbitrary point on the surface of that sphere, what would be a way of finding a vector orthogonal to that point and the center of the sphere
[23:22:23] <riv> GomJabbar: pick a random vector on the sphere and take the cross product
[23:23:00] <Decker> origin to that point on the surface is the normal to a plane that is perpendicular - any line in that plane counts
[23:25:04] <greenbagels> (what you want is called a tangent vector on the surface of the sphere)
[23:25:10] <GomJabbar> exactly
[23:25:15] <GomJabbar> i want a point on the tangent plane

[23:25:59] <greenbagels> ok, so let's define r as the vector from the origin to your surface point
[23:26:10] <GomJabbar> ok
[23:26:33] <greenbagels> take any nonzero vector orthogonal to r and add it to r
[23:26:48] <biberao> hiya
[23:26:58] <riv> i just told you how to generate one
[23:27:45] <greenbagels> yeah you can do what riv said but it doesn't work for general n-spheres B)
[23:27:46] <GomJabbar> so im calculating the cross product of what, r and the origin?

[23:42:33] <dfdx> Hi #math. This is kind of a super noob question, and if it is not math related please let me know. Someone told me that the concept exists in mathematical proofs. the question is, is there a word that describes the following scenario, for any objects A and B: A influences B, which in turn makes B influence A.
[23:42:41] <dfdx> it's kind of like a cycle. i mean you can come up with examples all over the place. in biology, climate change, etc. hopefully math, too.
[23:42:51] <riv> equivalence
[23:43:01] <mh_le> what is an outsphere?
[23:43:32] <dfdx> hmm... equivalence? doesn't feel right. but i guess i can see how it can be "equivalence" so long as you can create a function that takes you there and back.
