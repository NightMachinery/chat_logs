[00:02:56] <pjb> alcaeus: dont' use equal but <
[00:03:02] <pjb> or >
[00:03:34] <pjb> alcaeus: also, get-internal-real-time gives you time in some internal unit.  So 1000000 internal units can be whatever.
[00:03:59] <pjb> alcaeus: multiply with internal-time-units-per-second
[00:04:08] <pjb> (or divide).
[00:05:12] <alcaeus> pjb: figured equal might be an issue, but with < it still returns nil (internal-time-units-per-second = 1000000 on sbcl)
[00:05:32] <pjb> No, even on sbcl, internal-time-units-per-second can be anything.
[00:05:35] <pjb> It depends.

[00:06:04] <pjb> There's a #sbcl channel too.
[00:07:40] <alcaeus> thanks but the code is still not returning internal-time-units-per-second, which is the goal... is it a misplaced return statement? my loop fu is not great either :P
[00:08:34] <pjb> alcaeus: https://termbin.com/ddrb
[00:08:43] <sm2n> what are you actually trying to do?
[00:09:04] <sm2n> you're never going to have it be exact
[00:11:13] <pjb> Well, without loop body, it can be close enough: https://termbin.com/zipc
[00:11:31] <alcaeus> it's an emacs exercise, i want to do color manipulations on recently typed characters for up to a second
[00:12:08] <pjb> emacs has different time functions.
[00:13:28] <alcaeus> oh, figures. thanks all, that is a lot of useful info though.
[00:17:36] <Nilby> in emacs sometimes the mysterious answer is (sit-for 0)

[05:49:07] <nij-> I'm curious about why most functions defined in CL weren't defined as generic functions. For example, it'd make sense to me if I can extend the function '+. This is not to complain; I'm just curious why the decision was made that way.
[05:49:40] <White_Flame> clos was pretty new when the standard was coming together, iirc
[05:50:02] <White_Flame> and it's a lot of legacy in general
[05:51:02] <White_Flame> at the very least, the MOP wasn't ready in time for the spec
[05:51:30] <nij-> I see..
[05:52:22] <nij-> Kinda related: does the advent of local-nickname in a defpackage construct counted as a violation of the CL standard?
[05:52:47] <nij-> I consider it as an extension that doesn't (seem to) break backward compatibility.
[05:52:59] <White_Flame> I'm sure others can fill in more than I can, but I would suspect that speed & optimization might have had a part in it, too, as generic function calls were much heavier weight than standard functions
[05:56:15] <White_Flame> regarding PLNs, I'd guess the most likely violation would be in the symbol reader if any
[05:57:12] <etimmons> clhs defpackage
[05:57:13] <specbot> http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/m_defpkg.htm
[05:57:26] <etimmons> Implementations are allowed to extend the options
[05:58:22] <nij-> "Since implementations might allow extended options an error of type program-error should be signaled if an option is present that is not actually supported in the host implementation."
[05:58:34] <nij-> I'm very confused by this sentence..
[05:58:50] <White_Flame> add a comma after "extended options"
[05:59:50] <White_Flame> iow, unknown options should error out and not be ignored
[06:00:07] <nij-> But it's ok for implementations to add their customized options?
[06:00:54] <White_Flame> yes, the spec says implementations might do that
[06:01:45] <White_Flame> btw, I presume that FIND-PACKAGE finds local nicknames based on the current value of *PACKAGE*?
[06:03:42] <White_Flame> I guess that wording probably wouldn't violate the spec, either

[12:30:20] <lisp123> Would it be fair to say, any non trivial function API meant for external use should use keyword parameters exclusively to aide in documenting the arguments to a function call, within the call, and to future proof the interface (allowing for the addition of new keyword parameters in the future), and then leave it to the programmer to write their own convenience functions to then avoid having to keep writing keyword parameters in their call?
[12:33:24] <ck_> I wouldn't agree to that in these general terms, but it doesn't sound like a bad idea for an interface with many or varying arguments
[12:34:36] <pjb> lisp123: indeed, it may be a good style to use only mandatory and &key parameters for API functions.

[12:36:47] <beach> lisp123: Your functions could not be generic then.
[12:37:41] <beach> lisp123: Also, terminology issue, in a function call, we pass "arguments", not "parameters".
[12:39:12] <lisp123> beach: Thanks. By "keyword paramters in their call" I was referring to the :something-something part vs. for example the "3" in ':something-something 3'. Is there a term for that (keyword option? keyword argument?)

[12:40:37] <lisp123> beach: Sorry, what would you mean by functions could not be generic then?
[12:40:41] <lisp123> Got it, thanks
[12:41:31] <beach> Generic functions need required parameters for methods to specialize to.  If you have no required parameters, generic functions are pointless, and you deprive yourself of all the conveniences of generic functions.
[12:42:13] <lisp123> Ah yes, that makes sense. I quickly realised part of that when PJB noted to use only mandatory &key parameters, as with just &key parameters, there's not forced mandatory parameters
[12:42:26] <lisp123> Thanks
[12:44:06] <beach> There is no such thing as "mandatory &key parameters".  I think what pjb meant was "required" rather than "mandatory", and he said "mandatory AND &key...".

[15:13:49] <unixlisp> As we have two Dylan, in early "Lisp syntax Dylan", + is a method(can not add other methods),  and in late "Algol syntax Dylan", + is a generic function.  "why most functions defined in CL weren't defined as generic functions?", as Moon said at 88:"There does not appear to be any current practice at all, let alone a concensus ... X3J13's business, is to stabilize the Lisp of the 1980s so people can use it."

[22:14:11] <utis> say i wanted to make an alist of symbols and functions but i didn't want to type out the dot and the (lambda for every element, would it be a valid use of eval to pass elements of the form (symbol arguments-and-body) to something doing (cons symbol (eval `(lambda ,@arguments-and-body)))?  hope that's not too vague.  (i read somewhere that eval was evil and never needed)
[22:16:04] <White_Flame> what do you wish to type as your input form?
[22:16:10] <White_Flame> in terms of symbols/functions
[22:16:34] <Bike> eval is sometimes needed, but not for that. you could define a macro, maybe.
[22:16:41] <White_Flame> or probably just a mapcar
[22:16:58] <phoe> rule of thumb while doing Lisp code: you don't need eval
[22:17:06] <phoe> ...unless you do, but that's pretty damn rare
[22:17:17] <Bike> (defmacro my-alist (&rest entries) `(list ,@(loop for (symbol args-and-body) in entries collect `(cons ',symbol (lambda ,@args-and-body))))
[22:17:25] <White_Flame> oh wait, I get it
[22:18:20] <White_Flame> for stuff like this, I tend to use a macrolet
[22:18:22] <Bike> actually make it (symbol . args-and-body)
[22:18:35] <White_Flame> since it probably doesn't need to be a globally-visible macro
[22:18:47] <Bike> then (macroexpand-1 '(my-alist (foo (x) x) (bar (y) (values y y)))) => (LIST (CONS 'FOO (LAMBDA (X) X)) (CONS 'BAR (LAMBDA (Y) (VALUES Y Y))))
[22:19:19] <Bike> if your problem is "i don't want to type this repeatedly", the answer is quite possibly a macro

[22:43:57] <nij-> Can an instance of a class in CL be encoded in xml based on xml-rpc?
[22:49:40] <White_Flame> that depends way more on the values the instance holds, and how, than the fact that they're in an object

[22:55:43] <White_Flame> one big issue is if some values need to remain EQ between references
[22:56:36] <White_Flame> eg, instance 1 and instance 2 both have a value of (1 2 3), are those 2 EQ or not, before & after ser/deserialization?
[22:57:00] <White_Flame> or if they refer to other peer instances

[22:59:30] <random-nick> you can also use the MOP to go over each slot and serialise it that way instead of writing methods for every class, but then you have the problem of serialising slots you don't want to have serialised

[23:00:38] <random-nick> you would also have to write a method for every class of slot definition you use, but that would usually just be the standard slot definition
