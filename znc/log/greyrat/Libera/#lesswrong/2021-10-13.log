[03:57:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://www.asktog.com/papers/raskinintuit.html ... This is a good essay
[03:57:21] <Robomot> Jef Raskin on "Intuitive Interfaces"
[03:57:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have a substantive disagreement with Raskin, which I'll get to in a moment, but overall he makes some excellent points
[03:58:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> (lol @ the mouse experiment in particular)
[03:59:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also this jumped out at me:
[03:59:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> "It would read very differently‚Äìand more honestly‚Äìif the magazines discussed above made it clear that ratings were based, for example, 50% on user satisfaction, 30% on productivity, and 20% on familiarity. Note that user satisfaction and early productivity (long-term productivity, though of great importance to users, is not tested) are strongly dependent on familiarity, so that the rating system is further flawed in not
[03:59:14] <Obormot\Arcturus>  being built on a set of independent (orthogonal) bases: the three parameters tend to rise and fall together.
[03:59:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> That quality of a new interface paradigm that is commonly titled "intuitive" may well turn out to be one of the worst qualities it can have."
[03:59:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Two things here:
[04:00:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. The last sentence refers, of course, to the idea that a UI should be fully usable with no explicit learning or instruction at all, and Raskin's "may well turn out ..." prediction came horribly true: mobile UIs are its embodiment
[04:01:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. "early productivity (long-term productivity, though of great importance to users, is not tested)" - why it's naught but our old friend, THE THIRD USER
[04:02:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, my disagreement: I think there is something important which is (a) consistent with "intuitiveness" as characterized by Raskin, (b) is a desideratum of well-designed programs and UIs
[04:02:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Namely: what returns of effectiveness/efficiency of use may be gained from what investment of explicit learning/instruction
[04:04:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> That is, suppose I open ClarisDraw and I look at the UI and go "hm, not immediately obvious what to do or click on" - i.e., it's not familiar to me. Ok, then someone tells me (or I read in the user's manual) that here are the tools, here is how to select them, here are basic concepts of object manipulation. Cool, now I can start using the UI, doing stuff, in a purposeful way, *and then the program is "intuitive"*, and I will
[04:04:55] <Obormot\Arcturus>  almost never need any *additional* explicit instruction
[04:05:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> I will now be able to do a great variety of stuff with this program, *and master its various capabilities*, without requiring any any further explicit instruction or seeking out help etc.
[04:07:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> This to be contrasted both with the silly (and destructive) ideal where one needs *no* instruction or explicit, effortful learning, and can do all things with the program, AND with UIs where learning that you can do X in Y way doesn't get you very far in being able to do Z, W, etc.
[04:08:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> A UI can be said to be "unintuitive" if you can learn a bunch of things and then regularly still go "ok, how do I do <thing I don't specifically already know how to do>", and need to be told, or look it up in the help, etc.
[04:11:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> So under this view, saying "yeah, well the WIMP paradigm isn't intuitive because totally naive users try to pick the mouse up, like Scotty" misses the point; yeah, true, but (as Raskin himself notes!) *once you tell them the basic principle* of the mouse (and of windows, menus, etc.), you're now pretty much done, and everything from then on is "intuitive", because it's all just an application of that now-familiar interaction
[04:11:05] <Obormot\Arcturus>  pattern
[04:12:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> A little explicit instruction and/or effortful learning "unfolds" into naturally developing mastery of the system - as opposed to "any given action is its own specific incantation, to be independently learned". The former is "intuitive" even though the user with *zero* knowledge of the UI is just as stuck as in the latter case
[04:17:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> (The "incantation" stuff may sound like I'm holding out CLIs to be the paradigmatic "unintuitive" UIs, but - while there's plenty of examples in that domain! - that need not necessarily be true [though it often is, sadly]; and there's plenty of GUI examples. Google+ was notorious for this, and Google's approach to UX design is rife with it in general. In a typical Google UI, if you know that you have to click/tap on <whatever>
[04:17:03] <Obormot\Arcturus>  to do <whatever>, do you thereby know where other functions are, how other stuff works? Nope, it could be anything and anywhere, it could be disguised, it might not even look interactable, it's going to be in some arbitrary location and won't necessarily follow any knowable pattern, etc.)

However, there are two observations critical to the current discussion. First, Trump‚Äôs mean lies per day depends on the time frame sampled. For example, his average during the first 30 days sampled was 4.6 lies/day compared to
[04:41:19] <feepbot> 36.8 lies/day in the final thirty days sampled. Second, when we look at a one-day snapshot of Trump‚Äôs lies, he might not be revealed as an unusually frequent liar. Of the 649 consecutive days examined, Trump lied 0, 1, or 2 times (i.e., values within the normal range) on 38.2% of those days. In contrast, he told five to fifteen lies (his average, +/‚àí5 lies) on 27.1% of the
[04:41:19] <feepbot> days. In short, depending on which day was sampled, his lie frequency might be zero or it could be 125. We would draw very different conclusions about his lying behavior depending on the particular day that was sampled, and his tendencies are only recogniz able when viewed over time. This insight motived the current investigation into lying over time. Could the same day-to-day
[04:41:24] <feepbot> variability be true of other people?' heh

[05:33:11] <gwern> ivan: eg I'm pretty sure this is an IA scan https://andymatuschak.org/files/papers/Apple%20Human%20Interface%20Guidelines%201987.pdf because it's so garbage. it's weirdly mottled, the text is nastily pixelated, and it has obtrusive edges and tilts
[05:33:14] <Robomot> PDF (164 pages; 11.3 MB) - Apple human interface guidelines : the Apple desktop interface (Apple Computer, Inc)
[05:34:53] <gwern> eg pg43 - if this was a 1ds done with debinding,  then the last paragraph wouldn't be cutoff by the page bend
[05:36:12] <[itchyjunk]> do.. hidden layers also use activation function? Idk if my XOR approximator would need it or not
[05:36:49] <gwern> yes, they use activation functions. otherwise if they are just linear, they collapse down to a single linear layer as usual
[05:37:32] <[itchyjunk]> ah 
[05:43:05] <catern> gwern: that tweet about the "psychosocial effects" of the flint water crisis is pretty much unbelievable
[05:43:27] <catern> everything else in social psych is bs, I seriously doubt that's real either
[05:45:30] <gwern> catern: comparing copper pipe families to lead pipe families and showing the declines are equivalent is a pretty strong method
[05:46:30] <gwern> and it's true that lead is *so* popular to blame for anything and everything (I blame Drum) that it's due for some comeuppance
[05:46:47] <catern> oh I know the lead effects are huge
[05:46:56] <catern> er, tiny*
[05:47:07] <catern> easy mistake the keys are like right next to each other
[05:47:32] <catern> I just doubt the causality between "people are scared of lead" and "decrease in educational achievement"
[05:48:21] <gwern> increasing educational achievement is hard. decreasing seems like it could be a lot easier. "poor little timmy is pretty dumb, like his whole family. last year I wouldn't've bothered, but this year, must be the *lead* retarding him. better send him for special ed evaluation"
[05:49:39] <gwern> (my mom works in special ed. she says they always look forward to letting the kids use markers by christmas, after months of rehearsing how you write your name on a piece of paper)
[05:51:36] <catern> if it was really so easy for a high-profile news cycle focusing on your town to tank outcomes like this, I think that effect would be better known
[05:52:11] <gwern> flint was a super-extreme case, and you typically don't have instruments like pipes
[05:52:46] <gwern> which gives you a very precise way of saying "this family was *not* affected, even slightly, by this supposed disaster, as compared to the family literally next door which got a 100% dose"
[05:53:19] <catern> i'm contending that there was some independent cause of the outcomes getting worse for all families, not that it was lead instead of the news cycle
[05:53:47] <catern> (well, or more likely, just random variation)
[05:53:50] <gwern> what else could it be? as you say, it's such a large effect
[05:54:14] <enterprisey> lead does less than people say? tell me more
[05:54:19] <gwern> a bunch of slow brain-eating zombies moved in and ate the kids while the parents were at meetings on lead?
[05:54:42] <catern> if it was slow zombies we should see increasing performance in track and field
[05:55:14] <gwern> they might be slower in general because they are dehydrated from having to import fancy bottled mineral water :)

[06:31:14] <nshepperd2> 'charged with multiple counts of sodomy' that's still a thing?
[06:32:53] <gwern> I think sodomy got redefined to extreme and illegal acts. like how they struck down 'sodomy' originally and accidentally enabled bestiality in washington and pedophilia in NY or something like that...
[06:34:08] <gwern> 'A sodomy law is a law that defines certain sexual acts as crimes. The precise sexual acts meant by the term sodomy are rarely spelled out in the law, but are typically understood by courts to include any sexual act deemed to be unnatural or immoral.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodomy_law
[06:34:09] <Robomot> Sodomy law - Wikipedia (A sodomy law is a law that defines certain sexual acts as crimes. The precise sexual acts meant by the term sodomy are rarely spelled out in the law, but are typically understood by courts to include any sexual act deemed to be unnatural or immoral.[1] Sodomy typically includes anal sex, oral sex, and bestiality.[ ‚Ä¶)
[06:34:59] <nshepperd2> weird
[06:35:29] <gwern> yeah, it gets confusing: eg  'In April 2014, a proposed Louisiana bill sought to revise the state's crime against nature law, maintaining the existing prohibition against sodomy during the commission of rape and child sex abuse, and against sex with animals, but removing the unconstitutional prohibition against sex between consenting adults. The bill was defeated on April 15, 2014 by a vote...
[06:35:35] <gwern> ...of 66 to 27.[17] Utah voted to revise its sodomy laws to include only forcible sodomy and sodomy on children rather than any sexual relations between consenting adults on February 26, 2019.[18] Governor Gary Herbert signed the bill into law on March 26, 2019.[19][20]' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodomy_laws_in_the_United_States
[06:35:35] <Robomot> Sodomy laws in the United States - Wikipedia (Sodomy laws in the United States, which outlawed a variety of sexual acts, were inherited from colonial laws in the 17th century.[ ‚Ä¶)
[06:35:40] <gwern> I was hoping WP would have a nice table of what *is* still illegal
[06:39:07] <gwern> (anyway, er, I guess if they charged them with it, it must still be a thing in virginia at least for kids, although one does hope he didn't anally rape her)
[06:41:37] <[itchyjunk]> Someone odd that I would like to share.
[06:42:09] <gwern> I don't think it's odd. surely we can all agree that anal rape is worse than vaginal?
[06:42:17] <[itchyjunk]> I am watching house md season 2 and they say the brain doesn't have a lymph system. but i remember it being discovered some years ago. i check the episode air date and it was a few years before that was discovered.
[06:42:28] <[itchyjunk]> Not sure why I find this interesting but I do!
[06:42:52] <[itchyjunk]> Anal rape is necessarely worse?
[06:43:12] <gwern> seems a lot more damaging. anal sex in general is just more dangerous and potentially damaging, so make it violent and coercive...
[06:43:15] <[itchyjunk]> Low (no?) chance of pregnancy
[06:43:36] <[itchyjunk]> hmm, are the chances of catching std different for anal vs vaginal?
[06:43:41] <gwern> as STDs go, pregnancy doesn't seem great
[06:43:51] <gwern> and of course, with vaginal you still have all the other STDs
[06:44:13] <gwern> [itchyjunk]: it's probably because it's surprising both that such a fundamental fact of anatomy could be discovered only so recently, and also that it'd come up to remind you of it, so it feels like baader-meinhof
[06:45:02] <[itchyjunk]> ah "baader-meinhof" complex. didn't know this thing had a name.
[06:45:40] <[itchyjunk]> This is generally the answer people give to "i was talking about X and then my phone showed me an add of X". Similar concept right?

[06:55:27] <gwern> truly, synchronicity

[06:56:11] <[itchyjunk]> I read that a lot of those stuff was inspired by jungs work.
[06:56:23] <[itchyjunk]> Not sure how true it is, but made sense.
[06:57:47] <gwern> oh sure. jung was huge

[07:47:20] <PapuaHardyNet> when does education stop being a low hanging fruit for citizens of a country to use for social mobility exactly?
[07:50:42] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps it is a combination of the state of a citizen, and the state of a country, that incentivizes them to overvalue education

[14:13:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, to be fair to her, clearly Leverage is terrible (lots of accounts, not doubting hers at all), clearly it affected her horribly (completely understandable, wow).

[14:17:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway my point is that, like... this person seems (on a superficial skim / impression from her essay) to be basically decent, not terrible or anything, right, just kinda crazy (in perhaps a not-too-unusual "California" sort of way), but imagine building an entire organization out of people selected to be like that, and then the leader is also clearly a sociopath

[17:34:23] <kuudes> "Finland's National Advisory Committee on Vaccines (KRAR) is meeting on Wednesday to discuss which population groups, if any, should receive a third 'booster' dose of the coronavirus vaccine. "In September, the ECDC [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control] warned that the effectiveness of the first two doses could weaken towards the end of this year," Minister of Family Affairs and Social Services Krista Kiuru (SDP) tweeted on Wednesday morning.
[17:34:33] <kuudes> The potential need for a fourth jab will also be discussed by the committee, according to Yle sources. Finland currently has about one million doses in stock, which can remain frozen for between six and nine months, depending on the manufacturer. The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) further confirmed that health authorities have made jab orders to cover vaccinations up to the year of 2023."

On a year-over-year basis, prices increased 5.4% versus the estimate for 5.3% and the highest since January 1991. However, excluding volatile food and energy prices, the CPI increased 0.2% on the month and 4% year over year, against respective estimates for 0.3% and

Food prices also showed notable gains for the month, with food at home rising 1.2%.

However, the continued rise in prices even with the drop in vehicle costs could lend credence to the notion that inflation is more persistent than policymakers think. Airline fares tumbled 6.4% for the month after falling 9.1% in July. Shelter prices, which make up about a third of the

Owners' equivalent rent or how much an owner of a property would have to pay to rent it, increased 0.4% as well, its largest monthly gain since June 2006...Apparel prices also declined 1.1% in September while transportation services dropped 0.5%.

[22:32:54] <ainoue> What is the consensus in here about inflation in the US? Personally, I‚Äôve been quietly assuming that inflation is going to end up genuinely high for a few years
[22:33:14] <ainoue> Lots of my friends tell me otherwise, but the above seems pretty damning?
[22:34:29] <gwern> over the past few months I've mostly been increasingly thinking it'll last longer than I thought, because it seems to always come down to a labor shortage somewhere, and the workers just aren't coming back afaict
[22:35:24] <gwern> there is no inherent physical reason for all of these shocks to last for years. the vorgons didn't cut off our unobtanium shipments from alpha centauri. but if the workers aren't there, then it can be a permanent supply reduction in anything
[22:36:19] <gwern> (sure, everyone is frantically automating and rejiggering and substituting and investing to deal with it and try to return to an equilibrium, but that can take a long time)
[22:36:48] <ainoue> Surely we have to eventually converge on a similar amount of labor force participation as before? Else where will working class incomes come from, sans government incentives?
[22:37:21] <gwern> well...
[22:37:52] * ainoue tenses
[22:47:00] <rmmh> ainoue: it's ok if you subtract things that don't matter like housing, inflation is fine!
[22:48:17] <ainoue> rmmh: everyone in society can afford housing and it‚Äôs a miracle
[22:50:17] <kuudes> rents are in inflation, buying houses are not
[22:50:31] <kuudes> technically imputed rents could be in inflation/consumer prices I suppose
[22:51:22] <gwern> it mentions owner is 0.4%
[22:51:25] <rmmh> (I'm being sarcastic. a CPI that ignores housing costs is ridiculous)
[22:51:42] <kuudes> housing costs are included as rents usually, but not buying houses
[22:51:54] <kuudes> same as stock prices are not included in consumer prices
[22:52:08] <gwern> (I assume you calculate inflation in owner imputed rents by looking at comparable houses and observing their prices going up; since now you're 'paying' more implicitly for a houe that remains the same old crummy thing)
[22:52:09] <rmmh> people don't need to buy stock
[22:52:10] <kuudes> you don't eat apple shares, no matter what ghost of jobs says to you
[22:52:16] <kuudes> neither they need to buy houses
[22:52:21] <kuudes> they just need to live in one
[22:52:23] <rmmh> they need somewhere to live
[22:52:25] <kuudes> yes.
[22:52:27] <kuudes> they can rent
[22:52:29] <rmmh> and that generally means they pare for it
[22:52:33] <rmmh> pay*
[22:52:51] <kuudes> as we know, in many locales rents and house prices are not connected very well
[22:53:07] <kuudes> indeed in good market economy they should be connected, but in many locales they are not
[22:53:44] <kuudes> but this is indeed clear in berlin or nyc or sf - cost of apartments on buy are not connected on cost to pay to live in an apartment
[22:54:35] <kuudes> if they are connected, usually a reasonable middle class person who can pay a rent for some apartment should be able to float a loan to buy equivalent apartment for them to live in
[22:54:42] <kuudes> but in many locales apparently that is not true

[23:10:35] <kuudes> influenza?
[23:10:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who knows
[23:10:44] <kuudes> indeed
[23:11:04] <ggreer> it's been a while. maybe you're one of the lucky few who got covid twice
[23:11:05] <kuudes> they say that in addition to covid we now will have extra hard rs virus, parainfluenza and influenza
[23:11:11] <kuudes> ggreer, he already did
[23:11:35] <pompolic> rmmh: first i thought it was a tandem bike
[23:11:35] <kuudes> iirc Obormot\Arcturus got covid twice, correct me if I misrecall
[23:11:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> You are correct
[23:11:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> This feels very different though
[23:11:48] <kuudes> thanks and my condolences
[23:11:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> thx
[23:12:04] <ggreer> twice? I thought it was just once
[23:12:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> nope
[23:12:21] <kuudes> I have taken influenza vaccine and plan to take another dose of the same as a ad hoc booster shot for that, because why not

[23:13:54] <kuudes> dbohdan also has second covid now likely per his description :-(
[23:14:04] <TheWhisper> Who are all these people getting covid
[23:14:10] <ggreer> jeez look at all these people taking all the covid for themselves. so selfish
[23:14:15] <kuudes> hoo
[23:14:35] <TheWhisper> Share it around
[23:14:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> "What about covid?" "You've already had it." "We've had one, yes. What about second covid?"
[23:14:46] <ggreer> heh
[23:14:54] <TheWhisper> Just wait until elevenses covid
[23:15:24] <kuudes> it seems we are doing that, now indeed more people in my contacts are getting covid than before. I guess restriction lifting is the cause possibly?
[23:15:32] <dTal> my boss got a cold a few weeks back - he's still coughing now
[23:15:46] <dTal> the "cold" going round is no joke
[23:16:09] <kuudes> btw influenza vaccines got here a week or two ago, so I presume they are also just recently on your local pharmacies
[23:16:12] <dTal> kuudes: UK?
[23:16:15] <kuudes> finland
[23:16:37] <kuudes> but they are the same stuff in western world, so presumably there is not much difference when they come
[23:16:47] <ggreer> a lot of people I know got covid early on (april/may) or over the 2020 holidays
[23:16:53] <kuudes> I guess australia etc south side could have them on the other side of year?
[23:17:32] <ggreer> maybe nowadays it's so typical that you don't even mention it. "yeah I got covid. so what I'm fine now"
[23:17:46] <dTal> kuudes: the rate has held mostly steady for several months
[23:18:25] <dTal> but it's sustained, and in finland it's at the top end. So yeah, you probably would see a lot more people trickling in
[23:18:29] <kuudes> dTal, oh, you were talking about covid? sorry, I was talking about influenza vaccines :-p but yeah
[23:18:38] <dTal> oh whoops sorry
[23:18:41] <kuudes> :)
[23:18:45] <dTal> I forget there are other viruses :p
[23:18:50] <kuudes> indeed indeed

[23:19:13] <kuudes> over here cases have increased a lot now that they have lifted restrictions and told people covid has went away
[23:19:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Aren't colds also a coronavirus though
