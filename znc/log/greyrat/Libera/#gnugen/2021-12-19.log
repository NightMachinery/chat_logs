[01:23:13] <artectrex[m]> Today's xkcd is relevant: https://xkcd.com/2556 ðŸ˜œ

[11:49:35] <sunyibo> how paranoid are you guys with cameras in public spaces? Technically, when I'm typing in my passwords, while being filmed, my password becomes compromised. I do use pass -c...
[12:18:21] <sunyibo> why is it so complicated to have a current overview of directory sizes? Running r on ncdu takes a long time. I would imagine a table that gets updated while I'm moving around stuff.
[13:37:33] <Orbstheorem> <sunyibo> "how paranoid are you guys with..." <- Most security camera systems placed at reasonable distances will likely not record enough details to fully reconstruct your password.
[13:44:07] <Orbstheorem> <sunyibo> "why is it so complicated to have..." <- Depends on the details of the filesystem:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/0b48c9a283c2f94ab3a77baaad67ab49aa0bf9c8)
[13:46:44] <Orbstheorem> For instance, when I use ncdu to view my root directory, it believes my disk is storing around 30TB of data, because of all my backup snapshots which require my disk to store an extra kilobyte or two to keep around.
[13:47:47] <Orbstheorem> In reality, I'm overprovisioning my disk and storing around 1.4TB of data in a 1TB disk due to compression.
[13:49:06] <Orbstheorem> And when I query my available spice I get 93G (which is an approximate value that my fs can infer by looking at the root-tree metadata and running some statistics.)
[14:02:34] <Orbstheorem> <artectrex[m]> "> <@crijns:gnugen.ch> Maybe this..." <- I absolutely love this!
[14:02:35] <Orbstheorem> Microarchitectures ftw!

[14:34:42] <typedef[m]> <sunyibo> "how paranoid are you guys with..." <- Not that paranoid, but Edward Snowden had "funny" stories where he put on a very large hat whenever he had to enter a password into his computer just to be sure

[14:37:59] <LucasCrijns[m]> <sunyibo> "how paranoid are you guys with..." <- Maybe two factor authentication with a Yubi key or something can protect you from this? I believe PAM has such a plugin, enabling you to use two factor authentication
[14:40:45] <sunyibo[m]> lexekon is a very talented young penguin who wants to make friends and play games on linux.

[14:49:38] <Orbstheorem> Un mobile ?
[14:51:18] <afontain[m]> un machin qu'on attache au plafond et qui bouge
[14:51:44] <Orbstheorem> Ah, comme les trucs qu'on met pour les bebÃ©s ?
