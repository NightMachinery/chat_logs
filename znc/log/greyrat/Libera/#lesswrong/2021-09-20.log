[00:00:39] <feepbot> <gwern> 'But Evergrande’s funding channels started drying up well before last week. According to interviews with employees, state media reports and corporate documents seen by The New York Times, the company started forcing staff members to help bail it out as early as April, when it began peddling the short-term loans. Around 70 to 80 percent of Evergrande employees across China
[00:00:40] <feepbot> were asked to put up money that would then be used to help fund Evergrande operations, Liu Yunting, a consultant for Evergrande Wealth, recently told Anhui Online Broadcasting Corporation, a state-owned news group...Company management said the investments were part of “supply chain financing” and would allow Evergrande to make payments to its suppliers, Mr. Liu said in his
[00:00:40] <feepbot> interview with Anhui. “Because we employees had to complete a quota, we asked our friends and families to put money in,” he said. Mr. Liu said his parents and in-laws had invested $200,000, and that he had put about $75,000 of his own money into Evergrande Wealth.' https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/business/china-evergrande-debt-protests.html

[00:15:21] <rmmh> Verbal is a good split to have cunning monsters that can't talk

[00:20:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: As for gf vs. gc, this suffers from the problem that when you make your stats too granulary, you will find yourself struggling to find use cases, while also running into ambiguities - does this fall under gf or gc? etc.

[00:35:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: re: that NYT caramel apple cake recipe: the cake itself seems fine, but if you ever make this I would strongly recommend not using this frosting recipe. For *one* 9"-round layer of frosting, it uses 3 cups (!!) of confectioner's sugar, AND then an additional 7 oz of caramel candies! Adding the frosting *more than doubles* the amount of sugar in the cake...
[00:38:01] <gwern> (indeed. my opinion is that most recipes use too much frosting. fortunately, that can be amended simply by scraping some off, and then rememebering to not put so much on)
[00:38:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Instead, use something like the cream cheese frosting recipe from https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/63573/libbys-pumpkin-roll-with-cream-cheese-filling/ (replacing the 1c powdered sugar with ~2/3c brown sugar and increasing the vanilla extract a bit, for a butterscotch/caramel flavor)
[00:38:04] <Robomot> Libby's® Pumpkin Roll with Cream Cheese Filling | Allrecipes (Delicious and easy to make.)
[00:39:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This would cut the amount of sugar in the frosting by ~3x, if you even used the full amount, which I don't think would really be necessary as it surely takes less frosting to frost a single 9" round layer than to fill a 15"x10" roll cake...)
[00:40:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I have made this cream cheese frosting many times, fyi, and can recommend it highly; it always gets rave reviews)
[00:40:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> (You can flavor it with various cream liqueurs, too. I do Bailey's sometimes)
[00:42:12] <kuudes> gf is int, gc is wis
[00:42:17] <kuudes> verbal is cha
[00:42:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't think so
[00:42:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> gc would be the stat used for declarative knowledge, as gwern said - but that's definitely Int, not Wis
[00:43:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> (cf. https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/knowledge.htm )
[00:43:05] <Robomot> Knowledge :: d20srd.org
[00:43:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> We have descriptions of what the attributes mean, you know; we don't need to speculate or confabulate
[00:44:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons."
[00:44:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Wisdom describes a character’s willpower, common sense, per- ception, and intuition. While Intelligence represents one’s ability to analyze information, Wisdom represents being in tune with and aware of one’s surroundings. An “absentminded professor” has low Wisdom and high Intelligence. A simpleton (low Intelligence) might still have great insight (high Wisdom)."
[00:45:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Charisma measures a character’s force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness. This ability represents actual strength of personality, not merely how one is perceived by others in a social setting."
[00:46:51] <kuudes> meh. but the original question was not about d&d, but "If you had to divide the usual Intelligence stat in a vaguely D&Dlike game into 2 or 3 stats (which should seem balanced)"
[00:47:08] <kuudes> so knowledge(d&d) is useful but not defining
[00:47:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> (These quotes were from 3e; then there's also the following, from Gygax's AD&D 1e)
[00:47:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Intelligence: Intelligence is quite similar to what is currently known as intelligence quotient, but it also includes mnemonic ability, reasoning, and learning ability outside those measured by the written word."
[00:48:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Wisdom: Wisdom is a composite term for the character’s enlightenment, judgement, wile, will power, and (to a certain extent) intuitiveness."
[00:48:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Charisma: Charisma is the measure of the character's combined physical attractiveness, persuasiveness, and personal magnetism. A generally non- beautiful character can have a very high charisma due to strong measures of the other two aspects of charisma."
[00:50:22] <Betawolf> PoE's 'Resolve' seems clearer than Wisdom as a division from Int.

[01:13:50] <gwern> rmmh: there's no mystery about why political memes evolve along partisan grounds. but I don't think they are all that novel for it, nor do they lead to the scenario in scott's story - after all, everyone *already* knows if they hate trump or not, say. it's hard to see how to weaponize that further. the dress or yanni are interesting in cleaving people precisely in surprising or even...
[01:13:56] <gwern> ...unpredictable ways
[01:14:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Nothing, because it's an image and could've been altered or affected in god knows what ways
[01:14:35] <kuudes> I think rmmh point was in "the nearly exact bisection"
[01:14:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: The dress as seen in the image was a certain color, derivable from the RGB values. Of anything else, there is no fact of the matter.
[01:15:20] <gwern> kuudes: there is no more mystery than in the male-female sex ratio also being a 'nearly exact bisection'

[01:19:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: It's like... what if you take a picture of George Bush but your camera or image compression or filter or what have you is such that it somehow comes out looking like Bill Clinton. Well, who is this a picture *of*?? I mean... it looks like Clinton. What else is there to say? "I produced this image by photographing Bush"? So what? You could've produced it by putting in pixels by hand in MS Paint for all it matters...
[01:20:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Reference is not magic...
[01:20:23] <kuudes> in uk largest party currently has about double the seats the second party
[01:21:45] <Betawolf> (this is in part a Brexit effect)
[01:22:00] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: if one person says it looks like bush and another says it looks like clinton, which RGB values do we need to compare to determine who is objectively right
[01:22:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: The ones where we take a picture of Bush and a picture of Clinton and compare which the image actually resembles more
[01:23:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> And if there's no way to do that, well, then there's no fact of the matter
[01:23:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> The *facts* about the dress image were:
[01:23:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. The actual image was such that the dress was white/gold, period.
[01:23:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. Some people saw it as white/gold.
[01:23:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> 3. Some people saw it as blue.
[01:23:35] <saturn2> there are a virtually unlimited number of ways to do that. which one?
[01:23:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's it, there are no other facts that bear on the situation
[01:24:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Again, if there's no plausible unique way to do that comparison then there's no fact of the matter, and all that remains is "it looks one way to some people and another way to others"
[01:24:48] <saturn2> then the RGB values are back to being irrelevant
[01:25:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> In the Bush/Clinton case, sure
[01:25:17] <kuudes> Betawolf, well, canada has about similar https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Canadian_House_of_Commons_2020_standard.svg

[01:25:22] <kuudes> though they have elections tomorrow
[01:25:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> In the dress case, it's much simpler and there was an obvious unique way of answer "what color"
[01:25:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, as I said, the 3 facts I listed were the only facts
[01:26:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was *in principle* impossible to settle the question in any way beyond that
[01:26:17] <Betawolf> It's true you would not do bad, transported to a random time in the past 100 years, guessing that the government is Conservative.
[01:29:26] <saturn2> there's a clear way to settle it, since the image wasn't photoshopped or manipulated and there's an actual dress
[01:31:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> That hardly matters
[01:32:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's clearly possible to produce an image that looks gold by taking a picture of a dress that looked blue IRL, I don't doubt that the reverse is also possible given suitable lighting conditions and equipment and so on, so "there's an actual dress" is pretty much irrelevant
[01:33:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Photoshopping is just one (rather crude) way of severing the connection between "how does it look IRL" and "how does the image resulting from doing some image-generating process look on a screen"
[01:33:31] <saturn2> there wasn't any unusual equipment either
[01:33:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who said anything about "unusual"
[01:34:12] <saturn2> it was exactly what everyone thought it was, a phone camera pointed at a dress in a store
[01:34:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> That description encompasses a vast array of possibilities, which, again, is evidenced by *this very image itself*

[01:37:12] <saturn2> the people who said the dress was blue were correct about the question everyone was attempting to answer, and thereby revealed that they had a better ability to accurately surmise the lighting conditions with limited information
[01:38:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> I wasn't attempting to answer that question and neither were many other people
[01:38:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Many people instead correctly rejected said question as pointless and confused
[01:39:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> The ones who answered it "correctly" happened to be "right" by chance, which proves nothing
[01:39:50] <saturn2> it's obviously not by chance
[01:40:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Disagree
[01:40:47] <saturn2> if it were by chance there should have been equal numbers guessing red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, etc
[01:41:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> That doesn't follow at all
[01:41:40] <saturn2> why not?
[01:41:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indigo and gold are not two randomly selected colors
[01:42:01] <saturn2> that's what i said
[01:42:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is a fact about what perceived colors can be generated by what processes
[01:43:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> It does not therefore follow that it was impossible to start with a gold dress and generate that photo
[01:43:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed it almost certainly would've been much easier to do so than to start with a green dress and do same, etc.
[01:43:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> But even that proves nothing
[01:44:10] <saturn2> of course it wasn't impossible, it was just far less likely

[01:44:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wait no
[01:44:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> You mean far less likely to start with gold than with blue?
[01:44:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> In that case, no
[01:45:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> It looked gold to some people and blue to others and the ones to whom it looked blue happened to be right by chance; it just as easily could've turned out the other way

[01:48:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> (AND there were multiple versions of the pic floating around, with different amounts/types of image compression, which should've made everyone way more skeptical of the veridicality of the image, but didn't)
[01:50:24] <saturn2> we never know for certain that any photo isn't a trick or photoshopped, but nevertheless we often identify the colors of objects in them (with the reasonable expectation that those colors will closely resemble what we see if we look at the same object directly)
[01:51:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, we identify the way the colors of the objects we construe the scene depicted in the photo contains look to us
[01:52:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> We identify those with the ways the colors of the real objects in the real scene where the picture was taken would look to us at our peril
[01:52:05] <saturn2> and those construals can be judged accurate or inaccurate

[01:52:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> The identification can be more or less correct, but, again, we assume their correctness at our peril
[01:53:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> People should be way more skeptical of such things as a matter of course
[01:53:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Especially since they encounter violations of that assumed veridicality all the time
[01:54:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is an absolutely ubiquitous scourge of product photos, for instance
[01:55:22] <saturn2> imagine you used a new camera to take a photo of your favorite red ball. but in the resulting photo, the ball looked blue. would you then say "ah, this is a good camera, i am happy with my purchase. totally unrelatedly, i construed the subject of the photo to be an unexpected color for some mysterious reason"?
[01:55:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, of course not
[01:58:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> But imagine you used a new camera to take a photo of your favorite red ball and then used the resulting image as the product image for an eBay auction of that ball and then when you shipped it to the buyer he posted a complaint saying "the ball looked orange but actually it's red", would you say "this is a perfectly normal camera that takes normal pictures of things, here's a picture of my cat wearing an American flag cape for
[01:58:36] <Obormot\Arcturus>  proof"?
[01:58:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, you would, and people do
[01:59:53] <saturn2> in that case, i would be right and the ebay buyer would be wrong

[02:04:18] <saturn2> i'm confident i would be able to identify bananas as yellow and tomatoes as red, whether at noon or dusk
[02:04:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> IRL, yes, absolutely
[02:04:49] <gwern> my understanding was that a lot of the weirdness of human color vision is to enable that sort of semantic-color-constancy
[02:04:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yep
[02:04:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just so
[02:05:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> And photos confuse the heck out of that faculty, routinely
[02:05:42] <saturn2> yes, people are often surprised by the colors they see in pictures, but that's because they made wrong assumptions instead of right assumptions
[02:06:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This, by the way, is one of the reasons why paintings can sometimes look more realistic than photos, because a skilled/trained painter can correct for certain sorts of distortions introduced by the photographic process)
[02:07:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Landscapes are where you see this sort of thing most commonly)
[02:11:44] <saturn2> if two shoppers look at the same image of a product, and when they receive the product, one finds the product to be exactly the color he expected and the other does not, the former has more accurate beliefs than the latter
[02:14:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Only in the pre-Gettier sense of "accurate beliefs"
[02:14:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> He arrived at beliefs that turned out to match reality but not in a way such that we can say "yeah he was right, he knew what color it was"
[02:15:07] <saturn2> can anyone ever know anything?
[02:15:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Probably not
[02:15:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Radical skepticism is the only way
[02:15:43] <quanticle> Are we still arguing about The Dress?
[02:16:33] <quanticle> Yes, it was whatever color it was, human color perception is weird, there is no inherent difference between orange and brown.
[02:17:12] <saturn2> we agree on all the facts about the dress, we're arguing about what it's possible to know by looking at a photo
[02:18:17] <saturn2> i think the people who said the dress was blue were better at interpreting photos, obormot thinks they were only lucky guessers
[02:19:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: the wise man bowed his head solemnly and spoke: "theres actually zero difference between blue things and gold things. you imbecile. you fucking moron"
[02:19:55] <quanticle> It seems like this could be empirically tested by creating a bunch of photos with ambiguous colors. If the people who perceived The Dress' colors correctly were truly better at color perception, we'd see them guess other ambiguous photos' colors correctly as well.
[02:20:18] <saturn2> i agree
[02:20:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nah, the results would depend on the specifics of the process for "creating photos with ambiguous colors"
[02:21:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> But if you did something like this I would predict that the results wouldn't follow any kind of pattern like "some people are better at this", it would just be "some people happen to perceive X things in a way that turns out to match the 'real scene'" and this would vary by type of color ambiguity and other stuff
[02:22:04] <saturn2> it would need to be the same process - going to shopping malls and taking pictures normally, then picking out the ones with ambiguous colors. it would take many, many years to get a decent sample
[02:22:40] <quanticle> This is the sociological equivalent of those physics experiments that hunt for neutrino data.

[04:34:30] <gwern> (to give an idea of obscurity - I put in well over a hundred thousand edits to WP and others and was an admin, and I don't even know what template I'd use for that)
[04:34:44] <shawwwn> use the "do it or else I'll blow you up" template

[04:35:23] <shawwwn> "where there's a will, there's a way" -- no. where  there's a threat, there's a way
[04:35:27] <gwern> anyway, I just update my links when I run into it.
[04:35:48] <shawwwn> yes but I bet at least 5/4ths of your links are still broken
[04:35:57] <shawwwn> and you don't even realize it
[04:36:01] <rmmh> Wikipedia section rename log eh
[04:36:06] <kuudes> would it be useful for you to have a change detector spider?
[04:36:09] <shawwwn> yes!
[04:36:24] <rmmh> It's pretty easy to parse Wikipedia dumps for that 
[04:36:45] <rmmh> (how many Wikipedia articles does gwern link to? 1000?)
[04:37:56] <gwern> oh no, at least 10k
[04:38:15] <gwern> (I counted it in the past and noted it here somewhere)
[04:38:49] <gwern> shawwwn: naw, not 5/4ths. every time I sync, I pop open a W3C linkchecker run and fix some. today was /Catnip's turn 
[04:39:00] <shawwwn> uh huh
[04:39:10] <shawwwn> and how pray tell can you check a broken anchor?
[04:39:17] <shawwwn> impossible
[04:39:24] <gwern> shawwwn: it loads the remote page and looks at all the anchors?
[04:39:28] <adiabatic> ^
[04:39:29] <shawwwn> no way
[04:39:54] <adiabatic> I ran a link checker on my sites. I was surprised by how broken some of the links were.
[04:39:56] <gwern> shawwwn: ...why do you find that so implausible?
[04:40:23] <shawwwn> because someday you'll die, and then 5/4ths of the links will break. you have to automate
[04:40:29] <rmmh> It's not like getting the page is way cheaper than getting the anchors 
[04:40:29] <shawwwn> automate, automate, automate
[04:40:36] <shawwwn> that's the only way gwern.net will remain forever
[04:40:51] <rmmh> It's OK, you're allowed a little link rot if you're rotting
[04:40:59] <shawwwn> I think you can use string distance to automatically select the most plausible link
[04:40:59] <gwern> shawwwn: I *have* been considering freezing my WP links to specific revisions...
[04:41:02] <catern> gwern's fanclub will maintain gwern.net to fix the broken links
[04:41:33] <adiabatic> rmmh: well, assuming the target page isn't a giant pile of react JS delivered over fetch()/XHR…
[04:41:45] <adiabatic> gwern: don't see why you wouldn't
[04:42:06] <gwern> adiabatic: I like the idea of links which are up to date :( unfortunately, WP quality does not improve monotonically
[04:42:23] <gwern> also, it's yet more complexity to get & store revision IDs
[04:42:29] <adiabatic> considering the things you link to, you'd expect the important ones to gete worse non-monotonically
[04:42:50] <gwern> most of those 10k WP links are uncontroversial...

[06:50:22] <saturn2> shawwwn: i don't know a simple command to list all executables in your $PATH, but all the git commands can be found in /usr/lib/git-core/
[06:52:24] <shawwwn> ````````````
[06:52:26] <shawwwn> uh
[06:52:38] <shawwwn> yes but
[06:52:54] <shawwwn> the interesting part of the nerdism for me is the idea that the git commands don't necessarily need to be in a specific directory
[06:53:06] <shawwwn> and even if they are, you still need to get a short description of what each of them does, for e.g. git help -a
[06:53:27] * shawwwn wonders how git-help does it
[06:53:32] <shawwwn> without invoking each of them
[06:54:23] <saturn2> i think git help just lists all the files in /usr/lib/git-core
[06:54:52] <shawwwn> nah, most of these are actually mine https://i.imgur.com/0ZhBbKD.png
[06:54:54] <shawwwn> they live in ~/bin

[06:56:25] <saturn2> oh, right
[06:56:31] <saturn2> that'll do it
[06:57:00] <shawwwn> yep, that seems to be one way...
[06:57:10] <shawwwn> but then how would git-help get any help for each of those?
[06:57:16] <shawwwn> it needs some kind of short descriptor
[06:57:32] <shawwwn> e.g. https://i.imgur.com/54qcp9n.png
[06:57:58] <shawwwn> also apparently it's not /usr/lib/git-core on macos, and `which git-help` shows nothing
[06:57:59] <shawwwn> hmmm
[06:59:24] <gwern> shawwwn: 'completion generator'. when you hit tab on an empty CLI and bash asks you which of 5k+ executables you want, it has to get that information somewhere
[06:59:32] <gwern> also has a bunch of other versions for aliases, functions, files etc
[06:59:58] <shawwwn> `man compgen` has nothing, and compgen -h says bad option
[07:00:06] <shawwwn> silly unix
[07:00:11] <saturn2> it's a bash builtin, check the bash manpage

[07:56:47] <shawwwn> saturn2: architecture challenge for you. Suppose someone wanted to reimplement something like dropbox: block-level deduplication. What would you use? The only thing I got from HN was "look into btrfs and duperemove"
[07:57:08] <shawwwn> https://github.com/markfasheh/duperemove seems interesting, but it seems almost manual

[07:58:03] <gwern> bup?
[07:59:03] <shawwwn> interesting..
[07:59:48] <ivan> zfs did that and everyone hates it
[08:00:21] <shawwwn> ivan: yeah, but zfs did it in a silly way
[08:00:29] <shawwwn> it forces dedup at read and write time
[08:00:30] <ivan> whole files are ideal for deduplication because you can pre-filter on file size
[08:00:55] <rmmh> it's unclear how much dedup is actually worth it for dropbox
[08:00:58] <shawwwn> yeah but I want to be able to store imagenet as a tarball, as extracted files, and also as preprocessed tensorflow dataset files
[08:01:02] <shawwwn> without it taking up 3x storage
[08:01:04] <rmmh> at the block level
[08:01:27] <adiabatic> you'd think that per-file dedupe would be good enough for most things
[08:01:29] <shawwwn> alternatively, being able to serve tarball files might work (https://github.com/mxmlnkn/ratarmount)
[08:01:30] <rmmh> this was a sweet hack though https://github.com/driverdan/dropship

(Instantly transfer files between Dropbox accounts using only their hashes. - GitHub - driverdan/dropship: Instantly transfer files between Dropbox accounts using only their hashes.)
[08:01:45] <ivan> sounds like you want a programmable filesystem that can put together sequences of other files
[08:02:04] <rmmh> shawwwn: indeed, ratarmount gets you 2 of those-- not sure what 'processed tensorflow dataset' looks like
[08:02:13] <shawwwn> yeah
[08:02:20] <shawwwn> the trouble is, imagenet is a tarball of tarballs
[08:02:26] <shawwwn> and I forget whether ratarmount supports that
[08:02:38] <rmmh> yes
[08:02:40] <rmmh> Recursive Mounting: Ratarmount will also mount TARs inside TARs inside TARs, ... recursively into folders of the same name, which is useful for the 1.31TB ImageNet data set.
[08:02:45] <rmmh> hey look :)
[08:02:49] <shawwwn> (lol at https://github.com/driverdan/dropship)

[08:03:28] <rmmh> if tensorflow dataset files are like... metadata + the jpeg blob, you could probably cobble that together with some FUSE fuckery
[08:03:29] <shawwwn> hmm
[08:03:52] <shawwwn> well, it's probably fine to have it be a copy
[08:04:02] <shawwwn> the main goal was to serve the individual files via a webserver
[08:04:09] <shawwwn> so that people can write an imagenet viewer pretty easily
[08:04:27] <shawwwn> but without eating the cost of having to extract the tarball
[08:04:32] <shawwwn> I guess I'll just use ratarmount for everything
[08:05:01] <saturn2> you can write your own fuse modules, it's not terribly hard
[08:05:52] <rmmh> ratarmount is written in python, you could hack it up directly for this
[08:07:02] <rmmh> oh, you know this, you've already committed to it :)
[08:07:22] <shawwwn> yeah but that was like a year ago

[12:05:08] <PapuaHardyNet> does anyone here do time tracking? I'm curious
[12:05:30] <kuudes> everytime someone pays me to?
[12:05:59] <adiabatic> PapuaHardyNet: I use Timing
[12:05:59] <synthmeat> i do it on voluntary basis
[12:06:24] <adiabatic> sometimes I wonder where the time goes and it tells me
[12:06:25] <synthmeat> like, fellas i work with say "you're the only one that doesn't need to do it"
[12:06:51] <adiabatic> yesterday I went to the gym, spent a long time in the kitchen, and took a nap. all that ate up a whopping eight hours of my day
[12:07:01] <adiabatic> and that was only three things
[12:07:32] <adiabatic> none of which was video games
[12:07:50] <synthmeat> i mostly use it as leverage to prove we need to pay tech debt. "see, 70% of my time is spent fixing shit, it's time to back down from features and fix shit up"
[12:08:20] *** Quits: MerchantOfVenice (~patrick@user/merchantofvenice) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[12:08:33] <PapuaHardyNet> sounds good. I do a limited form of time tracking for work - basically I track pomodoros and what I do in them
[12:09:15] <synthmeat> i just have a dozen categories in a spreadsheet and put in minutes in there
[12:20:15] <shawwwn> I just sleep all day and hope nobody slacks me
[12:22:32] <synthmeat> you'd hate working with me then, i'm the one who slacks people :)
[12:22:49] <synthmeat> also the one who instigated semi-weekly calls
[12:24:56] <rsaarelm> I used to do time tracking for my own stuff as a pomodoro-style productivity thing.
[12:25:08] <rsaarelm> It worked pretty well for half a year or so, but I slipped off it.
[12:25:47] <rsaarelm> Also I made some stuff for implementing stochastic time tracking like this. http://messymatters.com/tagtime/
[12:25:48] <Robomot> TagTime: Stochastic Time Tracking for Space Cadets | Messy Matters
[12:27:19] <synthmeat> a) memory, check, b) obsessive, check. so i don't need stochastic? :D
[12:27:44] <feep[work]> the tagtime android app was last updated in 2014
[12:27:49] <feep[work]> :(
[12:28:20] <rsaarelm> Had this interesting thing where I wanted to specify the pseudorandom formula for doing the stochastic checks so I could have a multi-device setup for it, and wasn't sure just what to use to write the spec. Ended up going with C. https://github.com/rsaarelm/tt/blob/master/stochastic-ping-reference-implementation.c
[12:28:21] <Robomot> tt/stochastic-ping-reference-implementation.c at master · rsaarelm/tt · GitHub (Time tracking and todo tool. Contribute to rsaarelm/tt development by creating an account on GitHub.)
[12:29:29] <rsaarelm> Idea is that you have a mobile app, a browser alert or whatever that pings you when the stochastic times roll around, and then you have an entirely disconnected app somewhere where you go log in your current thing and it knows exactly what ping time you're talking about despite having no communication with the app.
[12:29:46] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:30:01] <rsaarelm> Of course this assumes a honor code for the user since all ping times are deterministic and known ahead of time, so it's useless for any sort of adversarial setup.

[12:32:44] <feep[work]> that's very fair
[12:32:58] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: maybe use a pseudorandom seed?
[12:33:16] <feep[work]> something like what geohashing does, closing dow jones of the previous day
[12:33:17] <rsaarelm> That's what I do, look at the C program I linked.
[12:34:24] <feep[work]> oh, you seed it off a common start time?
[12:34:27] <PapuaHardyNet> a cross platform personal time tracking app is what is missing from the current market

[12:35:44] <feep[work]> right
[12:35:52] <feep[work]> took me a sec XD
[12:36:14] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: ... oh, now I get it. you input a start time and it outputs a delay?

[12:36:30] <feep[work]> why not just compute a random delay and print that instead of the loop?
[12:36:57] <rsaarelm> There was some reason for that which I've forgotten since 2018.
[12:37:13] <feep[work]> maybe you like this distribution of delays more
[12:37:32] <rsaarelm> Oh, random delay's problem is that you don't know when the program is being called.
[12:37:40] <feep[work]> no like, seed with unix time
[12:37:43] <feep[work]> print random delay from that
[12:38:09] <feep[work]> but this will give you an, I think, whatshisface, what's the name for the distro .. normal distributed? delays
[12:38:18] <rsaarelm> Yeah, but if alert is at time t, t minus 20 and t minus 10 have different unix times but both must give you t.
[12:38:18] <feep[work]> instead of rand's bounded flat
[12:38:28] <feep[work]> and explicitly getting a normal distribution out of rand is a little nontrivial
[12:38:40] <rsaarelm> Well, t-20 says "wait for 20" and t-10 says "wait for 10".
[12:38:49] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: no I mean, rn you explicitly seed the program with a unix timestamp anyway
[12:38:53] <feep[work]> and it outputs a delay for that timestamp
[12:39:09] <feep[work]> just do that same thing but with an explicitly computed delay
[12:39:17] <feep[work]> same xorshift
[12:39:22] <rsaarelm> But t-20 and t-10 are different seeds, so they give me delays that end up in different points.
[12:39:55] <rsaarelm> And I need to get a delay that ends in the same point for every unix time after the previous ping.
[12:40:00] <feep[work]> I'm not even sure what distro this is, it's *not* normal because it has a lower bound where p goes to zero
[12:40:14] <feep[work]> OH, I see what you mean
[12:40:17] <rsaarelm> Yeah.
[12:40:19] <feep[work]> hang on, does this do that?
[12:40:42] <rsaarelm> It's basically a formula for "is this specific unix timestamp one where a ping occurs"
[12:41:04] <feep[work]> but ping_time is your xorshift seeeeeeeee OH I SEE, right, you're sampling on a *property* of the unix time
[12:41:09] <rsaarelm> And then it computes the delay by looping ahead until it finds the next timestamp that's a ping timestamp, and then it tells you how far away it is.
[12:41:12] <rsaarelm> Yes!
[12:41:12] <feep[work]> I forgot you reset the seed every cycle
[12:41:18] <feep[work]> that's clever
[12:41:39] <rsaarelm> It's not a real rng function, it just co-opts the math.
[12:41:55] <feep[work]> basically [first xorshift(a) == 0 for a in current_time .. int.max]

[12:58:25] <rsaarelm> My intuitions about which things God gave a soul to and which things God didn't give a soul to obviously come from my soul that God gave to me and are therefore valid.
[13:05:02] <rsaarelm> Though admittedly a brazen head automaton that answers alchemical questions like gwern is a confusing case, but I think the schoolmen have deliberated on it and the conclusion is that it is not truly alive because it will consistently respond with atheistic heresy when questioned about theological matters.

It smells like steak!” “I don’t know.” “No one is going to believe this.” “I don’t know if I even believe it.”...This fudge was really good. In fact, it was better than the non-beef
[19:04:11] <feepbot> portion of fudge that I had pulled out and set aside for Alex in case the beef fudge turned out to be a pile of…beef fudge. But the beef fudge was BETTER than the fudge that did NOT have beef in it. I never thought I would ever type that. It might have been that I used a food processor, but the beef pieces kind of just dissolved in the fudge. I didn’t get any of those weird
[19:04:11] <feepbot> crunchy bits the recipe talked about. It gave the fudge a nice depth of flavor and a complexity that was a shock. It also gave it a good level of salty that we appreciated. And, as the recipe writer claimed, it did dial down the sweetness significantly. It was also smoother in texture and slightly more gooey than the non-beef fudge. Maybe from the melted fat in the roast beef?
[19:04:16] <feepbot> Either way, it was shockingly good.'

A purified aesthetic also appealed to California’s alternative cultures: leftist cells, utopian communes, dietetic retreats, nudist colonies.
