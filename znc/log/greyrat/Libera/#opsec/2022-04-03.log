[03:16:24] <Joanna> Atque: jessicara iz I was reading previous conversation and there are a few points I’d like to make. There is a thing called entrapment where people who work for government infiltrate/organize protests and other organizations and encourage/participate in criminal acts.
[03:19:31] <Joanna> Also most very large well organized “protests” are probably either created or hijacked by people working for a government. I now believe the Canadian truckers were set up to fail as a pretext to create harsher laws. The people leading them weren’t even truckers. People are so gullible and keep falling for the same tricks.
[03:23:19] <Joanna> Sure protests sometimes succeed as a coup like in Ukraine because they are funded and organized by state actors with a lot of resources. Ordinary law abiding people protesting doesn’t accomplish much which is why it is constantly encouraged. The safest way to “protest “ is to just quietly not cooperate. But they never encourage that in news media do they?
[03:28:50] <Joanna> If everyone just stopped cooperating with unfair laws the laws would be gone in one second. But that’s not going to happen because most people are dumb fleshbots with bad software.  Constitutional laws is just there for show to be selectively enforced. It’s used to protect the creators of pornography and other destructive media but it is still a crime to go outside naked minding your own business in most places...
[03:30:34] <Joanna> One thing that really bothers me is how people sexualize little girls by making them wear bathing suit tops to cover boobs they don’t have..
