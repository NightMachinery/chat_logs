[00:11:57] <irwiss> yes it's probably good you didn't, lithium fires can be very bad, even blow off chunks of burning shit into the air

[00:16:20] <JakeSays> ki9a: is this for something you're writing, or are you injecting in to an existing process?
[00:16:22] <ki9a> so my problem is that with Boehm, you HAVE to register every thread you use it ofr

[00:20:07] <Suchiman> JakeSays: short circuits and exposure to oxygene since lithium will react violently with it
[00:20:11] <JakeSays> ki9a: on linux you could probably do an inotify on something under /proc/self
[00:20:26] <ki9a> That is a nasty way to do it though
[00:20:39] <JakeSays> well, it's posix
[00:20:40] <Suchiman> JakeSays: btw. you've heard MS contributed a windows frontend for flutter
[00:21:06] <JakeSays> Suchiman: they contributed a uwp frontend. google did the windows frontend
[00:21:15] <JakeSays> and the uwp frontend isn't done
[00:21:20] <ki9a> maybe that could work; I just don't know what the overhead ofa thread local is
[00:22:00] <JakeSays> ki9a: you could also hook the pthread_create function
[00:22:26] <SKull> ki9a: is procfs even on mac?
[00:22:33] *** Quits: peterR`` (~pter@88.103.230.136) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[00:24:04] <Suchiman> ki9a: the way .NET does it is when managed code is called or native code returns into managed code a GC transition happens which causes previously unknown threads to be registered with the runtime and then using a thread static classes destructor to detect dying threads
[00:25:32] <ki9a> Suchiman: any idea how a thread class destructor looks ?
[00:26:02] <SKull> ki9a: your solution is probably one or more 0f the many pthread_* functions
[00:26:21] <JakeSays> ki9a: i would imagine that on mac there's probably a native api for this sort of thing
[00:27:11] <ki9a> mac doesn't really have docs at the level below cocoa
[00:27:19] <ki9a> they deleted them
[00:27:32] <JakeSays> well, you have the darwin source

[00:27:59] <SKull> ki9a: use the freebsd docs
[00:28:47] <SKull> ki9a: or ddg.gg with the !man bang
[00:29:21] <ki9a> __cxa_thread_atexit
[00:29:32] <JakeSays> that's for exit notification
[00:29:56] <JakeSays> you could get that via pthreads too
[00:30:09] <ki9a> Yes
[00:30:15] <ki9a> but I can combine that with a threadvar
[00:30:30] <JakeSays> that won't get you a create event though
[00:30:50] <ki9a> I don't think ther is one
[00:31:10] <JakeSays> not w/o some trickery
[00:31:32] <ki9a> __threadvar int boehmregistered = 0 ;if boehmregistered = 0 then boehmregistered = 1; registerexit (gc_unregister); register_my_thread;
[00:31:34] <ki9a> something like that
[00:31:39] <ki9a> you said pthread had an api ?
[00:31:52] <JakeSays> for thread exit events, yes
[00:31:58] <JakeSays> well, using TLS
[00:32:08] <JakeSays> you register a thread destruction callback
[00:32:29] <JakeSays> but i thought you were after create
[00:33:00] <JakeSays> ki9a: out of curiosity have you ever looked at v8's c++ garbage collector?
[00:33:25] <ki9a> Not really no
[00:33:39] <JakeSays> it's pretty slick
[00:33:58] <JakeSays> chrome uses it for managing c++ objects
[00:34:21] <JakeSays> i was thinking about de-v8-ify'ing it
[00:36:33] * Suchiman looks at v8's JS GC: conservative, disgusting
[00:40:31] <ki9a> __cxa_thread_atexit << looking for the underlying api of that
[00:41:10] <JakeSays> ki9a: um, that might be in compiler-rt
[00:41:57] <ki9a> Looks like _tlv_atexit  on Darwin
[00:42:25] <Suchiman> (or just use the trick i've posted, should work everywhere :P)
[00:42:51] <JakeSays> Suchiman: what trick is that
[00:43:05] <Suchiman> JakeSays: https://github.com/dotnet/corert/blob/c6af4cfc8b625851b91823d9be746c4f7abdc667/src/Native/Runtime/unix/PalRedhawkUnix.cpp#L437-L461
[00:43:12] <ki9a> Suchiman: the c++ trick requires me to have well, the c++ runtime
[00:43:16] <ki9a> which I do not.
[00:43:19] <Suchiman> ahhh
[00:43:26] <JakeSays> Suchiman: that's not a trick.
[00:43:33] <JakeSays> it doesn't solve the problem at all
[00:44:20] <ki9a> a combi of a thread local var to see if it was registere,d nad _tlv_atexit will
[00:44:26] <ki9a> on Darwin at least
[00:44:46] <JakeSays> ki9a: but then something needs to check that var
[00:44:52] <ki9a> New
[00:44:56] <JakeSays> you going to poll or something?
[00:45:28] <ki9a> New as a starter
[00:45:33] <ki9a> but that won't fully cover it
[00:45:38] <JakeSays> right
[00:46:04] <ki9a> Given that I cannot control things fully
[00:46:08] <ki9a> this is the best I can offer
[00:46:38] <JakeSays> ki9a: couldn't you link in a pthread_create shim?
[00:49:38] <ki9a> Unfortunately the nr 1 usecase for this is GCD callbacks
[00:49:41] <ki9a> and GCD is messy
[00:49:50] <ki9a> (they call it grand central dispatch)
[00:49:55] <JakeSays> right
[00:49:57] <ki9a> it's really just a callback pool

[01:46:47] <khanred> _genuser_: yeah
[01:47:05] <_genuser_> what are some of the things you didn't like (curious)
[01:47:45] <khanred> The UI is just so drastically different and the server already seems to be struggling to handle our load
[01:48:08] <brianonymous> khanred: dont tell me that cuz i think we will be going to gitlabs soon
[01:48:09] <khanred> Point 1 may not be a valid criticism, but it's what's causing me problems
[01:48:35] <khanred> The CI stuff seems to integrate better...so I guess that's something
[01:49:19] <_genuser_> well there's non-intuitive UI and there's just different UI.
[01:49:23] <khanred> Seems to exclusively call them Merge Requests instead of PRs
[01:49:37] <khanred> _genuser_: Well it's certainly not intuitive lol
[01:49:53] <_genuser_> different might be hard to get used to because you're used to something else. But non-intuitive UI is basically without excuse. If you can't figure out easily what to do with your average devops tool, it's not designed correctly.
[01:50:40] <_genuser_> khanred that's what I think if you can't figure out by clicking around a little bit and have to really dig in and read docs, that's just a UI not properly designed.
[01:51:22] <_genuser_> I do'nt understand devops tools using 1 click deployment. ... They're all 1-click deployment. Seriously that's not an advantage only one devops tool enjoys.
[01:51:46] <khanred> Well I did figure shit out by clicking around but its not great

[02:12:02] <teegee> do you guys all roll with nullable enabled?
[02:12:02] <brianonymous> just recently had that bite us in the ass, but also have a net5 build in the wings waiting. what an awesome way to advance my causes.

[02:13:30] <jonp> teegee: absolutely
[02:14:14] <Suchiman> although on my main projects are still on .NET FX so the BCL is unannotated so the use is limited
[02:14:38] <Suchiman> then again i'm using patched reference assemblies for .NET FX that have nullable annotations on them, copied from core
[02:15:06] <Suchiman> then again only on my PC because getting every dev and the build machine to hack their ref assemblies seemed too much effort to me
[02:15:18] <teegee> lucky for me, I don't have legacy code. wooo :)
[02:15:32] <jonp> Suchiman: you can build against alternate frameworks like netstandard or net6, even though you won't "use" those bits on net472 or whatever

[02:20:38] <jonp> indeed, and usually i'm down with that.

[11:22:10] <Nasp> dont oyu lose sales by emptying the shopping basket every hour?
[11:24:35] <ap5> Well, it kind of depends of the implementation. Not many sites actaully deletes anything, but they soft delete lines on the basket, due to many reasons (stock runs out, a reservation runs out etc)
[11:25:29] <ap5> But it sounds strange if your basket cookie id, that represents the basket, is deleted by the website itself. That is a strange implementation.

[11:42:40] <MatthiasVance> mtj: Just install a newer one?
[11:43:18] <ap5> mtj, are you doing .NET 6/.NET Core (so it begins!) or .NET development?
[11:43:49] <MatthiasVance> ap5: You can make that easier by saying "You are using .NET 6, right?"
[11:43:53] <MatthiasVance> No need for the confusion
[11:44:04] <ap5> :)
[11:44:27] <Nasp> I have .NET 5 migration meeting in 30 minutes
[11:44:40] <Nasp> I was told we should speed it up and be done in 2 weeks
[11:44:41] <jmer> bring a sword Nasp
[11:44:46] <jmer> lol
[11:44:50] <ap5> :D
[11:44:55] <ap5> 2 weeks gg
[11:45:00] <Nasp> Been going on for months now
[11:45:03] <Nasp> Only controllers left
[11:45:07] <Nasp> But it still takes a long time
[11:45:11] <ap5> It does
[11:45:21] <Nasp> Especially since the FromRoute doesn't work as intended
[11:45:28] <Nasp> So you need to add that on all routes that need it from routes :/
[11:45:32] <Nasp> I thought i fixed it
[11:45:36] <mtj> ap5: no preference atm, (i just started with C#) so... NET6 :)

[11:46:28] <ap5> h.
[11:47:44] <MatthiasVance> h.
[11:48:04] <jmer> Anyone knowledgable about JIRA setup?
[11:48:06] <Bilz> hi*. I'm debugging some issue in our softwware. It's to do with double calculations. Sometime ago, some computer was done, and saved to a file, and returning 7.7389500000000009 (was saved to a file). Now when I do the calculation, I get 7.73895. Now, I know that precise, reproducible double calculations are a problem, but the test department aren't letting this go!
[11:48:07] <MatthiasVance> Yes
[11:48:09] <MatthiasVance> jmer:
[11:48:28] <jmer> our "JIRA guy" is claiming that it's impossible to set up a default "Description" template for tasks
[11:48:36] <MatthiasVance> What is a description template
[11:48:44] <jmer> MatthiasVance: a template for the Description filed
[11:48:47] <jmer> field*
[11:49:05] <jmer> MatthiasVance: so we can have a checklist like "Did you considder X, Y, Z, did you include repro steps" etc.
[11:49:12] <Bilz> what efforts can I do to try to reproduce, as I am out of ideas - i realise this is a broad question.
[11:49:41] <MatthiasVance> Bilz: Use decimal?
[11:49:48] <MatthiasVance> Then you have fixed the bug
[11:50:05] <MatthiasVance> You already know what the issue is, why do you need to reproduce?
[11:50:26] <Bilz> MatthiasVance, yeah, fixing the bug is ok. It's just reproducing it that is the problem
[11:50:30] <jmer> MatthiasVance: in other words; we want the Descrpition field to be pre-filled with certain stuff to "motivate" ourselves to fill out tasks/user stories properly
[11:50:38] <Bilz> MatthiasVance, test department man, the bloody test department!
[11:50:49] <MatthiasVance> Bilz: Bullshit?
[11:51:02] <MatthiasVance> Bilz: If they state "this is a bug" I agree, fix it? Why do you need to reproduce it?
[11:51:11] <Bilz> jmer, I think it's a great idea because i probably spend more time trying to reproduce an issue than actually fixing it, because of lack of info
[11:52:19] <mtj> any ideas for this vscode error, trying to debug a hello.cs file -> "unable to generate assets to build and debug. OmniSharp server is not running."
[11:52:42] <Bilz> MatthiasVance, it's a customer facing product in the scientific world and need to explain why it happened to the customer the first time. it's above by pay grade to argue that they don't need to reproduce. so i either reproduce, or continue telling them I can not until they give up
[11:52:57] <MatthiasVance> jmer: I don't know if that's possible
[11:53:11] <MatthiasVance> Bilz: You just explained it ...
[11:53:42] <MatthiasVance> Bilz: You do know what the issue is with double so explain that? Show them the specification?
[11:53:47] <jmer> MatthiasVance: it's super easy to do with Azure Devops
[11:54:06] <jmer> MatthiasVance: I refuse to believe that JIRA doesn't let you have default values for your various fields

[15:47:07] <MatthiasVance> Ah right, Entity Developer
[15:49:21] <Nasp> Bah, why can't i mix and match attribute + conventional routing
[15:49:36] <Nasp> Now we might need to migrate all routing during this migration and i dont wanna
[15:50:04] <MatthiasVance> Bah why can't you put kerosine in your car, it works for planes
[15:50:18] <MatthiasVance> Going from a plane to a car I don't want to deal with gasoline..
[15:50:21] <Nasp> I dont think you can compare that
[15:50:30] <ap5> MatthiasVance, i actually think they had :D
[15:50:31] <MatthiasVance> Sure you can, I just did
[15:50:46] <Nasp> I still have FromRoute issues :/
[15:50:49] <MatthiasVance> awh
[15:50:57] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: OH OH!
[15:51:05] <Nasp> It's quite annoying, and that might be why we need to rewrite all routes during the migration
[15:51:06] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Make sure the name of the parameter is *exactly* like the thing in the route
[15:51:10] <Nasp> And i wopuld prefer to stay with conventional
[15:51:20] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Yeah but that requires you to use attribute routing thingy
[15:51:22] *** Joins: Roughy (~mdaw45ns@user/roughy)
[15:51:24] <MatthiasVance> oh
[15:51:37] <MatthiasVance> I didn't know I only use that, but on a very high level because conventions
[15:51:45] <MatthiasVance> *because
[15:51:58] <Nasp> We couldn't agree on conventions
[15:52:07] <Nasp> Like i want to use api controller conventions
[15:52:09] <Nasp> But without the attribute
[15:53:35] <MatthiasVance> You mean the conventions you add on an assembly?
[15:53:47] <MatthiasVance> Or do you mean convention based routing
[15:53:55] <MatthiasVance> Because the former allow you to have no attributes
[15:54:04] <MatthiasVance> But still have sanity
[15:54:04] <MatthiasVance> :D
[15:54:13] <MatthiasVance> *also
[15:54:18] <Nasp> I mean [ApiController] fromroute
[15:54:32] <MatthiasVance> those are two separate things
[15:54:37] <Nasp> Or which doesn't requiring littering with attributres
[15:54:44] <Nasp> No ApiController adds a convention so it binds models more sanely
[15:54:59] <MatthiasVance> Yes, but you don't require to specify attributes... manually
[15:55:15] <Nasp> ?
[15:55:17] <Nasp> Yes
[15:55:31] <Nasp> I dont want to litter with FromRoute, FromQuery, FromBody and just use conventions
[15:55:59] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: "conventions" can either refer to using ApiConvention or convention-based routing, not sure what you're aiming for?
[15:56:16] <Nasp> MVC conventions that's called ApiController convention
[15:56:24] <MatthiasVance> So convention-based routing
[15:56:30] <Nasp> Which binds Complex models to body by default
[15:56:32] <Nasp> It's not convention based
[15:56:37] <Nasp> It called a convention
[15:56:42] <Nasp> But it's not convention based routing
[15:56:45] <MatthiasVance> "Actions are either conventionally-routed or attribute-routed."
[15:56:54] <MatthiasVance> Straight from the docs ;)
[15:57:20] <MatthiasVance> Even if you have attribute-routed actions, you *don't* have to specify attributes if you use ApiConvention, hence the confusion here
[15:58:01] <MatthiasVance> I know now that you mean convention-based routing because you mentioned MVC and that was the situation before
[15:58:07] <MatthiasVance> Just signalling that you could have it both ways
[15:58:15] <Nasp> I want it both ways but i can't
[16:02:08] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  What i would like is to use conventional routing + attribute routing in the same controller AND ApiController conventions
[16:02:27] <Nasp> And i thought i've kinda did that but it's not exactly default it we might have found a corner case
[16:02:37] <Nasp> And the other teammembers just want to rewrite all the routing
[16:02:49] <MatthiasVance> Yes
[16:02:57] <MatthiasVance> I would pick one and implement that
[16:03:06] <Nasp> Pick one routing?
[16:03:31] <MatthiasVance> Not necessarily, pick one or more that work and team can agree on is the best solution :D
[16:03:41] <Nasp> Well they agree best solution is attribute routing
[16:03:41] <MatthiasVance> I don't know your use case heh
[16:03:52] <Nasp> Since it's the default
[16:04:11] <MatthiasVance> And you don't want to have attributes everywhere.. that's solvable using ApiConvention on the assembly
[16:04:23] <Nasp> I dont want FromRoute attributes
[16:04:26] <MatthiasVance> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/advanced/conventions?view=aspnetcore-6.0
[16:04:36] <Nasp> I still want HttpGet("blahblah/{id}]
[16:04:54] <MatthiasVance> yes
[16:04:59] <MatthiasVance> Then you want what I just linked
[16:05:12] <MatthiasVance> Or at least, that's what I suggested earlier
[16:05:20] <Nasp> Yeah but what are those
[16:05:30] <Nasp> I dont think those are the same conventions
[16:05:34] <MatthiasVance> duh
[16:05:40] <MatthiasVance> That's what I've been trying to tell you :D
[16:05:51] <Nasp> [ApiConventionType(typeof(DefaultApiConventions)) <-- what does that actually add
[16:05:57] <MatthiasVance> These are *also* conventions, just explicit
[16:06:12] <Nasp> Yes but not the same conventions i'm talking abotu
[16:06:17] <MatthiasVance> I know that!!
[16:06:19] <MatthiasVance> :D
[16:06:54] <Nasp> Soo then wwhat
[16:07:01] <Nasp> Hmm my test passes now
[16:07:02] <Nasp> It shouldn't
[16:07:19] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Okay, let's take a step back, how many values are you having FromRoute for?
[16:07:22] <MatthiasVance> More than just "id"?
[16:07:30] <Nasp> A few
[16:07:48] <Nasp> Like usually one that's the customer id
[16:07:52] <Nasp> And then sometimes another
[16:08:31] <MatthiasVance> Oh wait so instead of HttpGet they want .. what?
[16:08:42] <irwiss> https://twitter.com/physicsJ/status/1491021889006833664?t=OAn5jUKK58ZIt9ybqlTfMA&s=19
[16:08:50] <Nasp> I want to have the MapControllerRoute("BlahBlahController")
[16:09:02] <Nasp> And inside that controller i want to use HttpGet("{id}")
[16:09:02] <irwiss> turns out if it's a bit windy it may affect magnetic fields :P
[16:09:17] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Yeah and in case of multiple things HttpGet("{id}/{somethingElse}"]?
[16:09:25] <Nasp> And on top of that i want it to use the conventions from ApiConvention that applies FromRoute, FromBody
[16:09:31] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  What about that?
[16:09:37] <Nasp> Then i just add them like that
[16:09:40] <MatthiasVance> Okay good
[16:09:51] <MatthiasVance> And when do you require FromRoute? Because that is the default
[16:10:11] <MatthiasVance> You already have [HttpGet] which specifies it's from the route
[16:10:14] <Nasp> That is somehow required
[16:10:18] <Nasp> And i've never quite understood why
[16:10:31] <Nasp> And in this case we need it everywhere, unless we switch to Attribute routing and Apiconventions
[16:11:02] <MatthiasVance> So something is wrong :)
[16:11:14] <Nasp> Yes
[16:11:27] <MatthiasVance> Because what you sketched earlier is perfectly possible, just using HttpGet and only FromBody when needed
[16:11:45] <Nasp> I would think so too, but yeah im just getting more and more confused
[16:11:51] <Nasp> And i asked the team if we should maybe add anotehr test
[16:11:58] <Nasp> But instead we should just remove the tests and use attribute routing
[16:12:02] <MatthiasVance> A good way to get everyone on the same page
[16:12:07] <Nasp> Which increases the complexity of the orgiinal task
[16:12:09] <MatthiasVance> Is to start a clean web project real quick, API project
[16:12:19] <Nasp> We did and it works more default there it seems
[16:12:22] <Nasp> But we are not quite sure why
[16:12:25] <MatthiasVance> ahhh
[16:12:41] <Nasp> That's why we wanted to just use attribute routing, but not sure if it would actually work
[16:13:41] <jmer> sounds like the typical "we have no clue why it works, let's just do something and hope" instad of actually figuring out why it broke in the first place
[16:14:10] <jmer> eerh.. what I mean is "we have no clue if it would actually work"
[16:14:47] <Nasp> Also still not sure if attribute routing is the right fit in this case
[16:14:51] <Nasp> Sure it's nice for smaller projects
[16:15:00] <Nasp> But when you have 350 routes, i would prefer having them ina file
[16:15:51] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: Anyways i'm quite sure it's still not possible to use Attribute and Conventional at the same time
[16:15:56] <Nasp> Because that would probably solve all my issues
[16:16:02] <Nasp> Since i kinda had to make my own routing
[16:16:54] <MatthiasVance> I'd take this opportunity to clean up all the routing
[16:17:03] <Nasp> Clean it up to attribute routing?
[16:17:10] <MatthiasVance> Also, you talked about MapControllerRoute("BlahBlahController"), but usually it's just endpoints and then .MapControllers()
[16:17:19] <Nasp> I couldn't remember it's name
[16:17:29] <Nasp> But it's something like MapControllerRoute
[16:17:39] <MatthiasVance> That shouldn't be there :o
[16:18:01] <Nasp> ?
[16:18:07] <MatthiasVance> Well, unless you want to use convention based routing ;)
[16:18:21] <Nasp> Like i said i would like to use both
[16:18:31] <Nasp> Convention to the controller, and then the controller decides for the actions
[16:18:48] <MatthiasVance> That is EXACTLY how it works by default
[16:19:04] <MatthiasVance> Seriously create a new web project -> API and check it out
[16:20:34] <Nasp> Hmm i was sure we tested that earlier
[16:20:41] <Nasp> But we didn't automate the test and tried 100 different things
[16:20:56] <Nasp> Kinda why i wanted to add tests instead of manual so it would be easier to agree
[16:21:01] <Nasp> And then when it's all green we know it works
[16:25:00] <Nasp> Bah have to go now, this meeting took most of the day
[16:30:00] <Suchiman> https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/63675 jeez if only windows file sys perf wouldn't suck as bad lol
[16:32:24] <MatthiasVance> wowww
[16:32:32] <MatthiasVance> That's a big difference xD
[16:32:55] <Suchiman> indeed
[16:33:00] <Diablo-D3> windows perf is fine though
[16:33:07] <Diablo-D3> unless you're git
[16:33:09] <Diablo-D3> or wsl2
[16:33:11] <Diablo-D3> or a database
[16:33:17] <Suchiman> Diablo-D3: or node
[16:33:19] <Diablo-D3> or actually do any meaningful io ops
[16:33:31] <Diablo-D3> somehow sqlite goes burr though
[16:33:50] <Suchiman> Diablo-D3: well iops isn't as bad, neither is database (see MSSQL), the problem is just many files
[16:33:54] * JakeSays likes his speedy zfs
[16:33:58] <Suchiman> but absolutely shredding one single file is fine
[16:34:01] <Diablo-D3> mmmmmmmmmmmmmm zfs yis
[16:34:13] <Diablo-D3> yeah, its just files that screw you
[16:34:21] <Diablo-D3> wsl2 gets double fucked though
[16:34:39] <Diablo-D3> git on windows natively is like 10x faster than linux git accessing windows fs
[16:34:56] <Diablo-D3> ironically, git on windows is 10x faster accessing wsl2's fs than its own...
[16:35:00] <Suchiman> Diablo-D3: yeah git-for-windows has a FS cache builtin IIRC
[16:35:08] <Diablo-D3> not fs cache issue
[16:35:23] <Diablo-D3> wsl2's 9p2000 impl is fucko on the windows side, known issue
[16:35:25] <Suchiman> Diablo-D3: i mean, that's why it's faster than unix git accessing windows
[16:35:46] <JakeSays> wsl2 with its own disk should be super fast
[16:35:47] <Diablo-D3> *any* op accessing windows side from wsl2 is cursed, not just git
[16:35:50] <Suchiman> Diablo-D3: but yeah wsl2 sucks :P
[16:35:56] <Diablo-D3> naw, wsl2 is great
[16:36:00] <Suchiman> wsl1!
[16:36:01] <Diablo-D3> they just need to do more work on the corner cases

[16:37:01] <JakeSays> wsl1 was a nice research experiment
[16:37:04] <Diablo-D3> git in wsl2 accessing linux fs is just a little bit faster than git.exe accessing linux fs
[16:37:27] <Diablo-D3> git.exe accessing linux fs is much faster than git.exe accessing windows fs
[16:37:34] <Diablo-D3> git accessing windows fs is fatally slow.
[16:37:52] <Suchiman> JakeSays: with awesome results but then they went like "nah, too much effort"
[16:38:11] <Diablo-D3> also, you cant ln -s from windows on the ntfs path yet
[16:38:55] <Diablo-D3> you CAN mklink from windows on the linux path
[16:38:59] <Diablo-D3> which is ridiculously wat

[16:42:01] <JakeSays> Suchiman: yeah it was pretty slick
[16:42:46] <JakeSays> the best way to access the windows side from linux is via cifs
[16:44:50] <mtj> hey folks, can anyone suggest a good #channel to get programming advice for a csharp newbie?
[16:44:56] <MatthiasVance> This one
[16:45:05] <MatthiasVance> It's called #csharp for a reason :D
[16:45:18] <JakeSays> well, you'll get advice.. no guarantees as to its quality
[16:45:41] <jonp> and no guarantees that it'll be good for a newbie
[16:45:48] <jonp> we're not teachers
[16:46:04] <JakeSays> just be wary of the europeans
[16:46:05] <Suchiman> JakeSays: and that's the bit i absolutely don't get, why didn't they go with cifs and instead went with this protocol nobody ever heard before xD
[16:46:11] <jonp> JakeSays: eh?
[16:46:17] <JakeSays> Suchiman: exactly
[16:46:39] <JakeSays> jonp: i'm continent shaming
[16:46:58] <jonp> right, but at least provide a bizarro explanation for *why* to content shame
[16:47:00] <Diablo-D3> you mean why 9p2000?
[16:47:09] <Diablo-D3> because the windows side of smb has bad perf
[16:47:14] <JakeSays> Suchiman: seems like they could've created an optimized cifs pipe

[16:47:18] <jonp> "can't trust the brits on programming, 'cause their cooking sucks" or something
[16:47:24] <Diablo-D3> they actually had a prototype of their shit where they used samba on the linux side fine
[16:47:32] <Diablo-D3> they couldnt get windows's own smb to perf
[16:47:42] <Diablo-D3> this is a hilarious admission from microsoft
[16:47:47] <JakeSays> jonp: i am pre-caffeine, so that's the best you get for now
[16:47:55] <Diablo-D3> they have a blog entry on their not-called-msdn-anymore blog
[16:48:07] <jonp> poor MSJ
[16:48:34] <mtj> can anyone suggest a suitable syntax to call the Sound1() function, in the following example (not homework - honest) -> http://lomont.org/software/misc/robotron/
[16:48:46] <Diablo-D3> whats really interesting is how they implemented the 9p2000 client
[16:48:54] <Diablo-D3> whats even MORE interesting is, it seems to be a legitimate one
[16:49:06] *** Joins: MaNa2k (~MaNa2k@224.81-166-66.customer.lyse.net)
[16:49:56] <Diablo-D3> double also, their choice in 9p2000 was largely driven by qemu having a virtio backend already
[16:50:36] <Diablo-D3> and linux already has full support
[16:50:55] <Diablo-D3> their choice of protocols basically were "does linux already support this and we dont have to write anything on that side"
[16:51:36] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: lol what island?
[16:51:49] <jonp> Diablo-D3: that would suggest CIFS/Samba, yet that wasn't used.
[16:51:58] <Diablo-D3> jonp: again, they couldnt get the perf they wanted

[21:05:48] <BtbN> Yes, which is what's interesting if you don't only use it as Office PC that's never stressed.
[21:06:05] <GetShwifty> that's why the individual who did real world business loads
[21:06:06] <BtbN> If you don't put it to work, there's no reason to buy such a chip in the first place
[21:06:21] <GetShwifty> and compared total power draw (NOT JUST PEAK) power draw
[21:06:33] <GetShwifty> gave an interesting perspective
[21:06:48] <BtbN> You buy those high core count chips if you do stuff like compiling a ton of code, video processing, ...
[21:06:57] <GetShwifty> yeah
[21:07:01] <BtbN> all stuff that will absolutely hammer all cores, and will happily make it draw 200W+
[21:07:07] <GetShwifty> that's kind of why i wanted to see
[21:07:13] <GetShwifty> somebody in here who had one
[21:07:18] <GetShwifty> and see what their REAL world experience was
[21:07:40] <BtbN> All those "Hurr durr doesn't use 200W in every day use" "debunkers" run light games on it, and then shout bullshit because it only draws 60~100W doing that
[21:08:01] <GetShwifty> the person who did this
[21:08:05] <GetShwifty> was not running light or games
[21:08:14] <GetShwifty> the people claming  200W are OVERCLOCKING AND
[21:08:21] <GetShwifty> running nothing but games or cinebench
[21:08:34] <GetShwifty> something that is not REAL world every day business/heavy use
[21:08:39] <BtbN> No, the CPUs use 200W without doing any kind of OC
[21:08:52] <BtbN> there's no notable headroom for that anyway, Intel goes right to the limit by themselves
[21:09:14] <GetShwifty> but you're just repeating what you saw on gamersreview/pcreview/trustedreview
[21:09:33] <GetShwifty> you've not actaully used one, and actually measured/monitored power usage
[21:09:41] <BtbN> Are there Pro-Intel Tinfoil-Hats now or what is this?
[21:09:52] <BtbN> There's plenty of people who have tested this, all coming to the same conclusion.
[21:10:05] <BtbN> If you stress those high end CPUs, they turn into furnaces
[21:10:51] <BtbN> Yes, if you only use them for office or some games, they won't get to the point where they use that much. But why spend that much money on such a CPU if you then never use it? You don't need a monster of a 16 core to play some games.
[21:19:26] <DevJohnC> yeah, my understanding was if you wanna put any kind of real load on a 12th gen i9 you needed a decent cooling AIO or high end fan cooler
[21:19:55] <GetShwifty> which i'm fine with
[21:20:07] <GetShwifty> one of the things pointed out by the article that did REAL WORLD testing and TOTAL DRAw
[21:20:26] <GetShwifty> some of the takss Intel used more power while processing the load, but finished up 10-30% sooner
[21:20:40] <GetShwifty> and when you averaged out how long Ryzen took to finish the same load ryzen ended up using more power
[21:21:00] <GetShwifty> and i'm okay with that kind of burn because that's a burn i'm willing to accept. burn more gas to go faster and get there sooner
[21:22:22] <GetShwifty> whgy it would be nice to see some real world usage/reports from people running similar software/workloads

[22:47:50] <BtbN> Assuming my 16 Core Ryzen and the 16 Core Alder Lake will take roughly the same time to build some project, the Ryzen clearly wins.
[22:48:00] <BtbN> The Intel chip will burn 200W while compiling on all cores.
[22:48:21] <BtbN> The Ryzen chip sticks to 120~125W
[22:48:36] <BtbN> so unless Intel somehow managed to be more than twice as fast, which they don't, they're much less power efficient
[22:48:52] <irwiss> meh unless you're running a datacenter it's not really interesting
[22:49:16] <BtbN> It is. Having a 100° furnace in your PC isn't healthy in the long term
[22:49:55] <BtbN> You can turn off the "over-budgeting" those chips do, so they stick to TDP. Then Intel and Ryzen are roughly on-par in power draw. And Intels performance advantage has vanished.
[22:51:39] <BtbN> The whole "But muh real world usage" stuff is Intels Marketing-Ploy to explain away that they need to draw extreme amounts of power to compete with AMD.

[22:52:00] <BtbN> In their beloved real world usage, it's 100$ irrelevant if you use an Intel or AMD Chip. They'll both be more than fast enough.
[22:52:04] <BtbN> *100%
[22:54:13] <irwiss> the temperature of the furnace is completely irrelevant, the wattage is, open a window

[23:44:11] <GetShwifty> what's that?
[23:44:35] <GetShwifty> is that the service nvidia is pushing where you pay to lease a card because nvidia 'can't produce enough' ?
