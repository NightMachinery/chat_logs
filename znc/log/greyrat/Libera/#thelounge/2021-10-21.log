[03:07:11] <johncs> Some kind of visual hint that a user is no longer on the room would be nice. I feel like that comes up often, but I don’t know that I’ve ever had a client do that
[03:08:19] <johncs> i remember I had an irrsi filter that would at least show parts for recently active users for this reason (whereas normally I had it filter out parts)
[03:08:47] <shadoozo> would be nice indeed, but for that you'd need to track nickchanges too (and if we're going there I'd also like it if my pms automatically adjusted on nickchanges so I can easily continue to chat and keep the chat history for that person there) 
[03:09:02] <shadoozo> irccloud does that, and it's really helpful
[03:16:19] <johncs> I think it’d still be helpful without that, and not terribly confusing
[03:17:24] <johncs> Tracking nicks seems like it might not always be a good thing. I bet some bridges mess with their nicks rapidly and wouldn’t want us to change the nick in the chat history automatically
[03:17:40] <johncs> though I haven’t mucked with too many irc bridges

[08:16:00] <bookworm> johncs: the "smartfilter" for join / parts is something I'd like to implement for just that reason
[08:17:27] <bookworm> had a wip that crapped itself due to me using array idx over the actual message ID, need to do this some other way
[08:18:19] <bookworm> also not sure if I want to shove it in the client or server... client would keep the load there but we could really optimize the network traffic for the backlog if we shove it in the server

[20:04:01] <Activ8> bookworm do you know the exec plugin, can that do updates of packages by command line?  What sort of things do you have it doing if you don't mind me asking? I'm just having a play about with the exec plugin that's all and trying to get it to do updates.  Do you run an update script of some sort then execute the script?  Would you mind giving me
[20:04:01] <Activ8> some examples?
[20:04:44] <Activ8> When I execute /exec it tells me "error: Command failed: /scripts/update.sh /bin/sh: 1: /scripts/update.sh: not found"
