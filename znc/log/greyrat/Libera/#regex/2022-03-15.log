[16:37:09] <re101-coyote-48> Hi! I am trying to replace the beginning of each line with a random number in a text document using sublime text. I use ctrl+H to replace ^ search for a new line and replace \d, but it does not work :(. Can someone help me with this?
[16:40:07] <Andrio> re101-sheep-35, try using capturing groups instead. e.g. maybe /(?<=q)u/ can be replaced with /q(u)/.
[16:40:55] <Andrio> re101-coyote-48, I don't recall exactly how Sublime Text works, but can you place a cursor on the beginning of each line and paste a separate string to each?
[16:41:07] <re101-sheep-35> Andrio can you do that  here https://regex101.com/r/fmLuYS/1

[16:42:23] <re101-sheep-35> Andrio that code is not work.. it says that is lookbehind
[16:42:42] <re101-sheep-35> many browser doesn't support lookbehind
[16:48:11] <re101-coyote-48> Andrio just like any other text editor. Each text editor has a text replacement function ctrl+H and using it I want to insert a random digit at the beginning of each line of my text document. I'm trying to replace ^ with \d , I hope that there will be a random digit from 1 to 9 on each line of the document
[16:48:34] <Andrio> re101-coyote-48, unfortunately you can't do that with just regex.
[16:48:48] <Andrio> What you can do is go to random.org to get a list of random numbers and paste them into your document.
[16:49:51] <re101-coyote-48> I have a long document and it will take a very long time to do it manually :(
[16:51:10] <re101-coyote-48> it is necessary that a digit from 1 to 9 or from 1 to 25 be added to each line at the beginning
[16:52:47] <Andrio> what's a digit from 1 to 25?
[16:53:27] <re101-sheep-35> Andrio can you got any solution for me
[16:55:44] <re101-coyote-48> Andrio i mean random digit from 1 to 25

[17:02:31] <re101-sheep-35> I don't want to select white space
[17:02:40] <Andrio> re101-sheep-35, use the first capturing group

[17:03:09] <Andrio> You can paste into the start of each line using that

[17:53:14] <re101-sheep-35> (?<!
[17:54:26] <purplex> so you are using it in a browser itself.. is that the add-on that doesn't support it?

[17:55:45] <purplex> works for me
[17:56:15] <purplex> what do you mean by browser doesn't support it?
[18:07:38] <digitok> not all browsers have support for ecmascript 6

[18:19:58] <wyre> are () always for backreferences? 
[18:20:29] <wyre> I mean ... I can see in those examples https://wiki.debian.org/debian/watch the capturing group (.+) but I'm not sure if this is just this, a capturing group
[18:23:08] <wyre> hmmm, apparently () can be used for several purposes ... 🤔 https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Regexe.html#zz-2.12
[18:24:32] <Andrio> It's basically used to pull out part of a match.
[18:24:38] <Andrio> And also for backreferences or recursion.
[18:28:26] <wyre> Andrio, what when you use `(?:pattern)`?
[18:28:38] <Andrio> That is a non-capturing group.
[18:28:38] <wyre> what's the purpose of brackets then if you disable the capturing group? 
[18:28:41] <OnlineCop> wyre: The notation for '(...)' has always been a group, and is supported in all regex flavors. Over time, the non-capturing '(?:...)' version came about, probably because people wanted to differ between stuff you group and stuff you keep.
[18:29:22] <wyre> OnlineCop, hmmm, I cannot see the difference between grouping stuff and keeping stuff 🤔
[18:29:40] <Andrio> wyre, so you can apply quantifiers such as + to a group without using a capturing group.
[18:30:02] <OnlineCop> wyre: Here's an example: `((?:\w)+)`
[18:30:19] <OnlineCop> Imagine that `\w` is actually a more complicated atom/expression.
[18:30:45] <OnlineCop> You have an outer "capturing" group that keeps everything that it found. The inner group repeats as many times as it can.
[18:31:06] <OnlineCop> If you have `((\w)+)` instead, what the regex engine sees is that there are TWO capturing groups: the outer one is $1, and the inner one is $2.
[18:31:25] <wyre> hmmm, then I think I cannot make the difference between a group and a capturing group  
[18:31:27] <OnlineCop> Each time the inner one matches another `\w` character, it overwrites what was in $2 with the new letter.
[18:31:54] <wyre> so are backreferences the very same than capturing groups? 
[18:32:10] <OnlineCop> Your final result will say that capture group $1 contains "everything" you wanted to match/substitute, etc., but then you also have this "partial" group $2 that doesn't have all of them; it just has the "last" of the matches.
[18:32:24] <OnlineCop> Backreferences like \1 and \5?
[18:33:06] <wyre> oh, I see, so the capture group is actually () the backreference are like \[1-9], right? 
[18:34:06] *** Quits: re101-sheep-35 (~re101-she@202.134.14.153) (Quit: Client closed)
[18:34:08] <OnlineCop> Yes, that's right.
[18:34:15] <wyre> I think then this is a little confusing to me https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Regexe.html#zz-1.1
[18:34:24] <OnlineCop> Reading left-to-right, the first '(' the regex encounters is group 1, then the next is group 2, etc.
[18:34:27] <wyre> because what I understand from there is that () are the backreference
[18:34:44] <wyre> but they are actually to create a capturing group that you will be able to reference with a backreference, right? 
[18:35:18] <OnlineCop> The exception is when '(' is immediately followed by '*' or '?'. In those cases, since those quantifiers aren't "valid" after the start of a group, "someone" decided that it would let the group do special things, like be a non-capturing group, etc.
[18:35:28] <OnlineCop> Yes, that's correct.
[18:36:29] <OnlineCop> There's going to be a difference in notation, though: the pattern expects \1, \2, ... \9 within the pattern itself when you use a (...) to capture. When you do substitutions, most modern flavors expect you to switch to using $1, $2, ... $9 instead of backslash-number.
[18:37:12] <wyre> yes, I can see the differences between python and perl 😊
[18:37:13] <OnlineCop> Python still likes \1, \2, ... in the substitutions, though, so it chooses to ignore the $-number.

[22:39:32] <OnlineCop> What part do you want to keep? Everything except '/personal/' (or anything that comes before 'videos')? Just "videos" and nothing else?
[22:41:29] <OnlineCop> Personally, I'd just match `/personal/` and then start capturing the `\w` word characters after it: https://regex101.com/r/5MYZkM/1
[22:43:08] <coder7of9> oh okay thanks i can try that
[22:43:13] <OnlineCop> Javascript typically has built-in commands to split up the URL's query and return you key-value pairs, but if you want /personal/ followed by anything up until it reaches the query-delimiters of '?' and '&', you could replace `(\w+)` with `([^?&]+)`
[22:43:22] <coder7of9> i wanted just videos   everything elese goes
[22:43:39] <OnlineCop> Take a look at Code Generator on the left of regex101.

[22:44:23] <coder7of9> thanks :)
[22:44:45] <OnlineCop> That should give you something you could copy-paste if you just want that captured group. Or if you want to replace everything else with "nothing", https://regex101.com/r/5MYZkM/2 (https://regex101.com/r/5MYZkM/2/codegen?language=javascript) is another way to do it.
