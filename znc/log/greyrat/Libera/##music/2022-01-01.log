[06:01:19] <four> Good evening nativetexan, and MusicalDillo :)
[06:01:28] <MusicalDillo> Hi four
[06:02:55] <nativetexan> i went to HEB this morning, that was a mistake. it was absolutely packed
[06:03:11] <MusicalDillo> no doubt
[06:03:21] <MusicalDillo> that's why I went Thursday ;)
[06:03:22] <piercedwater-> the winn co around here was swamped this afternoon. no way was I going in there
[06:03:35] <MusicalDillo> and Walmart was still really busy
[06:06:05] <nativetexan> at&t has had free hbo and cinemax this week but i haven't found any movies i wanna watch so far
[06:06:13] <four> I wish I could wander the wide-open spaces of America.
[06:06:21] <four> But how does a Brit get a green card!?
[06:06:38] <nativetexan> cross the border down here in texas/mexico
[06:06:50] <four> Ahaha :)
[06:06:53] <MusicalDillo> haha
[06:08:07] <nativetexan> change your name to quatro
[06:09:01] <MusicalDillo> actually, there are people from all over the world crossing the southern border now that Biden's leaving it open :/
[06:09:35] <MusicalDillo> but that's a discussion for another channel
[06:09:36] <nativetexan> oh, four is spelled cuatro not quatro
[06:09:52] <four> This country is becoming quite tiresome, I know the masses like to slate America for various popular reasons, but it still looks like there is opportunity for real freedom to me!
[06:10:01] <four> Ahaha, cuatro it is! :)
[06:10:12] <MusicalDillo> depends on the State, four
[06:10:41] <MusicalDillo> Lots of Californians and others moving to Texas because it still has some semblance of respecting the Constitution
[06:11:04] <nativetexan> tru dat
[06:11:18] <MusicalDillo> Florida also
[06:11:46] <four> I like the idea of Texas, more so than Florida! I wonder how long I could stay if I were just to holiday?
[06:12:45] <nativetexan> looks like up to 6 months
[06:12:59] <four> Oh, that's more than I expected!
[06:13:26] <four> Would a sensible person be safe to just back-pack around Texas these days?
[06:13:29] <nativetexan> well, that's the simple answer apparently, seems there are guidlines to it and all
[06:13:56] <four> Ah, no doubt! There is so much red-tape everywhere these days!
[06:14:37] <MusicalDillo> four> Would a sensible person be safe to just back-pack around Texas these days? << depends where, I'd stay away from the southern border
[06:14:53] <MusicalDillo> lots of problems with drug cartels down there
[06:14:58] <four> Ah, that seems sensible! :)
[06:16:17] <MusicalDillo> It's not like backpacking around Europe
[06:16:56] <MusicalDillo> It can be really dangerous in the US
[06:17:29] <MusicalDillo> no 'Youth Hostels' or anything like that
[06:18:01] <four> Ah no, I'd pay for Motels etc.
[06:18:31] <MusicalDillo> Depending on the State, there may also be COVID restrictions
[06:18:57] <MusicalDillo> and depending on the city in Texas
[06:19:03] <four> Oh yes, I forget about that! We seem to be ignoring them completely in England!
[06:19:15] <nativetexan> lol
[06:19:24] <MusicalDillo> heheh
[06:19:29] <nativetexan> yeah, i wou;dn'

[06:19:43] <nativetexan> i wouldn't visit australia right now
[06:19:59] <MusicalDillo> Yeah, try Austria or Germany lol
[06:19:59] <four> It's madness really, I can only imagine what's going to happen here in the next week or two :/
[06:20:49] <MusicalDillo> So have you got your 6th booster injection yet?
[06:21:28] <nativetexan> i just got the first 2 myself, i'm gonna let that roll a bit
[06:21:29] <MusicalDillo> Yes, it's getting very silly and counter-productive
[06:22:06] <four> Ah, yes, my third! I'd rather not have any more! lolol
[06:22:22] <MusicalDillo> Hopefully the thing will burn itself out soon
[06:22:34] <four> Hopefully, only time will tell :/
[06:22:57] <MusicalDillo> The Omicron version supposedly has symptoms of the common cold
[06:23:17] <four> Well, this seems true for the previously vaccinated.
[06:23:59] <four> I read that 90% of hospitalizations here are unvaccinated, the remaining 10% being the vaccinated vulnerable.
[06:25:53] <nativetexan> i've so many different numbers about hospitalizations, i'm not sure what's true anymore
[06:26:33] <four> This is fair, I just try my best to avoid exposure, and submit to the vaccinations to cover the scenarios I cannot escape from.
[06:26:38] <four> It's a sorry state of affairs.
[06:26:47] <nativetexan> true
[06:27:29] <four> I've been working from home for the past 2 years straight, and I think I need to escape for a while, and go walkabout, before my sanity does! :)

[06:37:11] <nativetexan> yes murthy
[06:37:23] <Panther> Is that like a quarter of second life?
[06:37:43] <murthy> nativetexan: there is a enhanced version of it called "Black mesa" what do you think about that?

[06:38:47] <murthy> nativetexan: It's like a remastered version of half life, with better graphics and stuff
[06:39:17] <murthy> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mesa_(video_game)
[06:39:18] <Janet`> ^ Black Mesa is a first-person shooter game developed and published by Crowbar Collective. It is a third-party remake of Half-Life made in the Source game engine.
[06:39:22] <nativetexan> oh ok, half life was a good game as i recall, it's been a while since i've played though
[06:39:25] <Panther> It is really sweet and looks very very red. :)
[06:39:36] <murthy> I have never played half life and people say it's a cult game
[06:39:43] <murthy> Ya
[06:39:59] <nativetexan> yeah, half life came out decades ago
[06:40:05] <murthy> So I think I will try it with this new black mesa

[11:00:34] <nativetexan> tons of moisture
[11:00:43] <Panther> I don't like it, but it hasn't been that bad here.
[11:00:50] <Panther> It was worse in PA.
[11:01:09] <nativetexan> miserable humidity here
[11:03:05] <Panther> :(
[11:03:08] <Panther> a/c
[11:03:25] <nativetexan> yeah and a dehumidifier
[11:03:27] <Panther> Mine is running right now.
[11:03:36] <Panther> It's pumping air in from outside.
[11:03:53] <nativetexan> mine doesn't
[11:04:06] <Panther> I also have the heater on low, so it keeps it about 60 in here.
[11:04:12] <nativetexan> it's just the constant humidity
[11:04:40] <nativetexan> anyways, happy new year, i'm going to bed
[11:04:47] <Panther> The condenser of this one won't work this cold, so I guess you do need a dehumidifier.

[15:49:13] <murthy> I would call that violent
[15:49:14] <artao> i like my racing games, but the ones i have you don't get to do the customizing and stuff

[16:05:03] <artao> VERY tempted to pick up IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad along with Flying Circus
[16:05:16] <artao> cuz then I could do online WW1 biplane dogfighting
[16:05:44] <artao> which is super fun

[16:07:11] <artao> the what?
[16:07:14] <murthy> and also dividing games with dlc is very irritating
[16:07:25] <artao> lots of games have that. i don't entirely get it either
[16:07:36] <murthy> artao: I see a lot of games with dlcs named "Season pass"
[16:07:36] <artao> seems basically like a way to get people to pay for a game every year
[16:07:44] <artao> with new content and shit
[16:07:54] <murthy> oh ya, that could be it
[16:08:11] <artao> eternally keep selling DLC rather than make new games
[16:08:12] <artao> LOL
[16:08:46] <murthy> also It seems people are paying for in game content, seems like a pseudo currency, bogus and could have been the precursor to this crypto currency mania

[16:09:23] <artao> yeah, in-game currency. microtransactions
[16:09:36] <artao> been around quite awhile

[16:09:55] <artao> in some games you can play for free but have to pay for decent equipment

[16:47:09] <murthy> and after seeing the "on sale" you buy a lot
[16:48:19] <murthy> artao: can you freely roam fallout 4 world without playing any scenario?

[16:48:52] <artao> i've not played it myself, but it is open world
[16:49:00] <artao> like the elder scrolls games
