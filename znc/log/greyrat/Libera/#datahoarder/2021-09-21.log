[02:03:04] <evilgohan2> oh boy
[02:03:10] <evilgohan2> Activision/Blizzard leveled up
[02:03:16] <evilgohan2> now have TWO federal agencies going after them
[02:04:16] <sarnold> two stars!
[02:05:07] <evilgohan2> Well, they've already had the state of California come after them so that's at least 4 stars (on the pre-GTA V scale)
[02:05:10] <skye0_mobile> Nice! Then we can be done with the annual CoD spam BS
[02:05:13] <evilgohan2> So, feds now means 5 stars
[02:05:43] <skye0_mobile> Sadly Overwatch is tainted at this point
[02:06:35] <evilgohan2> but hey, you too can buy "Remastered" D2 this week!
[02:06:54] <skye0_mobile> At least gay women still have Life is Strange, one big draws of OW was a lesbian who wasn't (just) far material
[02:06:55] <evilgohan2> I'd tag it as /s, but I know a bunch of Gamersâ„¢ will go out and buy it anyway.
[02:07:18] <skye0_mobile> At least another company I hope can be king of the arcade shooter
[02:07:33] <evilgohan2> Battlefield has a new game later this year
[02:07:46] <skye0_mobile> By God u hope not Ubisoft because their as bad as Activision too
[02:08:03] <skye0_mobile> BF2042 better not flop 
[02:08:08] <evilgohan2> yeah, except no one pretends Ubisoft is a good company
[02:08:19] <evilgohan2> But Blizzard fanbois...
[02:08:21] <evilgohan2> oh man.
[02:10:10] <skye0_mobile> Yup, and Activision ones I reckon 
[02:11:08] <skye0_mobile> I tolerate EA because they haven't gone this low AFAIK. Also, The Sims 4, only other game I enjoy atm 
[02:11:46] <skye0_mobile> Getting bored of BF4 somewhat and compared to Splitgate BF4 makes me sloppy
[02:13:24] <skye0_mobile> I have only Splitgate to look forward to if even after the delay BF2042 flops

[03:39:47] <PanickedKernel> Hey all. I'm looking for some input on a good backup program that I'll mostly be using for code. I will be backing up from windows to a linux server. I'd love if there was a gui on the windows side. I have used restic in the past and I'm wondering if that is popular? Any input is appreciated!
[03:39:50] <dTal> superkuh: I actually have the feature length version of that
[03:40:06] <dTal> totally data-hoarded it before it got purged from the net
[03:40:08] <skye0_mobile> stop tempting me geforce experience with BF2042, i need to save for rent, and even if i get one of those systems i might not even get it on xmas
[03:42:22] <cirdan> skye0_mobile: yeah once dropbox limited me to 3 computers and wanted to spy on all my docs i mostly stopped using them
[03:43:33] <skye0_mobile> i still have dropbox, and have some sensitive data on it. i don't use dropbox often though and i try to back it up elsewhere too cirdan

[23:08:00] <evilgohan2> skye0_mobile: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/police-car-sex-affair-surrey-b1923528.html
[23:08:11] <evilgohan2> I blame MSN news on that one.
[23:08:28] <skye0_mobile> yeah
[23:08:49] <skye0_mobile> i'm also gonna have to consider moving away from the nhs if I don't get a permanent position in 6 or 12 months, but even then i'm still unsure
[23:09:11] <skye0_mobile> the only pain of being a young adult for me so far - unable to land a permanent job and the BS that comes with it
[23:13:06] <NiLon> seems like microsoft's plan worked to promote their own news site by forcing it to every user
[23:14:26] <skye0_mobile> i don't like MSN because they also promote some of the shitty local newspapers too and it makes MSN seem like they're shit quality
[23:14:37] <skye0_mobile> Honestly I'd prefer to avoid the news, even Google news
[23:14:53] <skye0_mobile> MSN just seems like a tabloid to me
[23:21:19] <ThePendulum> so Apple is working on making iPhones detect depression
[23:21:43] <skye0_mobile> hmm...
[23:22:00] <skye0_mobile> kind of what happens when you don't have universal healthcare for one
[23:22:08] <skye0_mobile> you have sleazy companies filling that void or whatever
[23:23:29] <ThePendulum> it can offer a tool even good healthcare perhaps can't, because no one wants to talk to a psychiatrist as long as they're on their phone
[23:23:44] <ThePendulum> but I am very skeptical about where that information can potentially be channeled
[23:23:50] <ThePendulum> governments, insurance companies
[23:24:32] <ThePendulum> there are probably going to be similar applications from Google who will be more eager to use it for advertising
[23:26:18] <skye0_mobile> pretty much what happens when you have small government (except to nuke other countries and spy on its own) and big business
