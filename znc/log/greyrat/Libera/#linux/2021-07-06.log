[00:56:45] <msiism> I see.
[00:57:04] <phogg> No one is entitled, but it's amazing that the developers claim to do things in the interests of the mass of users, but repeatedly refuse to listen to actual user feedback.
[00:57:22] <msiism> Right.
[00:57:27] <phogg> A small number of noisy users who actually ask for something are trumped by a *theory* that some large number of users, if asked, would disagree.
[00:58:18] <msiism> (By the way, GitLab regularly makes me bite the air infront of my monitor, sometimes other things that get in the way. Just saying…)

[03:03:46] <KungFuJesus> Hello, I seem to have an issue with FreeBSD's NFSv3 server and Linux's v3 client.  For whatever reason, the server seems to go deaf to RPC requests for a bit and I have to wait what I think is the full 600 seconds for a timeout and retry.  This is the error output from the kernel when rpcdebug is on: https://pastebin.com/rCv2ZTri
[03:04:03] <rob`> greatcoof: it refers to the maximum integer size that a computer's CPU can handle without extra processing.

[03:06:13] <rob`> For instance, a 32-bit computer counts Unix time in "seconds since 1970". That counter runs out in 2030-something. Any 32-bit unix computers around then will overflow that counter.

[03:09:26] <rob`> 2038 is close enough that we're already running into the need to project dates that far into the future pretty regularly. Your average mortgage, for instance.

[04:38:04] <expert975> Can I tell linux not to flush part of the disk cache when it starts swapping out pages? In other words, can I reserve some RAM for the disk cache even when low on RAM? I have swap on compressed ram(zram) and I get a lot of disk access when the kernel starts swapping out. I'm pretty sure it's being caused by the processes' executables being read from disk over and over again

[12:43:13] <autopsy> Like using what home written procured and working C source code binary they wrote to bind to and see if you're listening the port will be bound so they will get a failure the reciever when he tries to nc anything anywyas.

[19:33:51] <otisolsen70> Dagmar, felco: thanks for your help. Is there any risk that the tun routes  (VPNs) will affect which route it will take? I do not think so. They are resolved first, right. And then the packets going through the tunnels are wrapped in another packet that goes through either wlan0 or eth0 determined by the Metric, righT?
[19:34:26] <Dagmar> otisolsen70: The question as stated is a little bit wooly, but no
[19:34:57] <otisolsen70> Dagmar, yes it is. Sorry. Will try to be more specific...
[19:35:09] <Dagmar> Once a packet goes into the tunnel interface, the original destination address is gone inside the envelope and is no longer sometrhing the routing table cares about
[19:35:23] <A4L> Weird... Even if I bind-mount /proc to /var/xxx/proc and set the mode=700 or umask=007 option, those options do not show up in the `mount` list afterwards, all other options do... But if I set an invalid option, let's say hidepid=invisible, only available in kernel version 5.2 AFAIK, dmesg will complain, otherwise it will simply ignore those options.
[19:35:25] <Dagmar> THe packet is now "just data" and part of the payload of the packet constructed by the tunnel interface
[19:35:30] <otisolsen70> Dagmar, right. So there is no risk that the vpn tunnels will ever influence this.

[19:38:41] <otisolsen70> IN this specifici case I have eth0 and wlan0 on the exact same subnet. so this is why metric is used. What if both are on two separate ADSL connections for instance. How does it determine which one to use for upstream?

[19:39:34] <curdlesnoot> A4L: hidepid is a meaningful option in the context of procfs, so it wouldn't be right not to scrutinize the option's value. I suppose that's why.
[19:39:56] <Dagmar> Such values can be laughingly referred to as being in "hash order"
[19:40:08] <Dagmar> ...meaning whichever comes first comes down to how they're stored in memory and may change from moment to moment for no apparent reason
[19:40:15] <otisolsen70> Dagmar, ok, so it may actually change at any time... So some packets going out through eth0 and others through wlan0. And thus break any tcp conection
[19:40:31] <Dagmar> No that's unlikely to break an existing connection
[19:41:12] <Dagmar> It may however, play hob with any new connections going out, since lots of things bind to 0.0.0.0 and let the _kernel_ decide what the source address is based on the destination and routing table generally indicating an optimal outbound interface

[19:46:19] <otisolsen70> Dagmar, what I am a bit worried about is the situation where, say, eth0 is connected to an active link. However, that link does not go anywhere because of some upstream routing problem. And the wifi is also connected to a working connection. Then I will experience failing connections.

And it will also connect to various wifi networks. It must always have a working connection. And it should prioritize ethernet when available. But NOT if ethernet is not actually working.

[21:46:39] <Dagmar> ceph does a damn fine job at the expense of occasionally making a storage admin flee the facility screaming uncontrollably
[21:46:40] <[twisti]> ah, yeah, thats why i picked storage spaces. but its definitely not fast
[21:46:56] <koollman> or at least regular raid does. you could do some neat splitting of the disks in partitions and assemble those in raid volumes respecting various constraints
[21:46:58] <[twisti]> but i use it for media files so i dont really care about performance

[21:47:51] <Dagmar> [twisti]: The TL;DR is that not only do we have mdadm, we also have LVM which is totally fine with new disks being added to a volume group, provided you're only asking it to span across block ddevices

[23:53:35] <beltwaybob> But lots of movies were, ahem, released, without having been on DVD
[23:53:39] <beltwaybob> Nah, the laserdisc/cd is too thin
[23:53:44] <beltwaybob> it doesn't have a satsfying cartridge
[23:53:57] <beltwaybob> if it has a cartridge over the media and a door, that is so much cooler
[23:54:00] <Topco> i could run my entire OS from DVD if i wanted to
[23:54:02] <phogg> koollman: mdadm and lvm both rely on being able to write superblocks in specific locations, and they also tend to want to be able to overwrite metadata in those blocks. It would be difficult to create a valid set of discs that is also possible to assemble as an array.
[23:54:18] <Dagmar> beltwaybob: I think you should just give it another five years before Corsair starts sticking RGB LEDs on goddamn thumbdrives made of largely lucite, and then you can skip straight to Federation technology
[23:54:35] <koollman> phogg: that is the 'might' part. I think mdadm has a few modes with external storage for the superblocks

[23:56:06] <coroner> modprobe blinken.lights=1
[23:56:07] <phogg> koollman: assembling ro once you have the bits in the right places is completely doable, I was just thinking that putting the blocks where you need them without random access would be hard
[23:56:12] <beltwaybob> well, it is just showing that the circuit is active
[23:56:17] <beltwaybob> so there still could be problems
[23:56:22] <beltwaybob> but the problem isn't that the circuit is receiving no power
[23:56:35] <beltwaybob> I mean, sometimes that is the problem, e.g. you have tribbles eating the circuit boards
