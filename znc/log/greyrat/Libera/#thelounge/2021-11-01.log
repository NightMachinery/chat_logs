[03:05:50] <johncs> artico: I think Activ8 has the right idea. You can just count the number of connections to whichever port you're serving thelounge from. It may not be perfectly accurate since each user could have more than 1 connection active at a given time, depending on what they're browser is doing, but it should be a useful tool nonetheless.
[03:06:18] <johncs> Here's some info on doing that I found quickly, but I imaging you could find other resources easily enough: https://serverfault.com/questions/527875/how-do-i-get-the-number-of-currently-established-tcp-connections-for-a-specifi
[03:08:19] <johncs> If you're reverse proxying through nginx, you could also use it logs or diagnostic tools to accomplish this. That could give you much more information like IP addresses, and you should be able to get as-accurate-as-possible with that method.

[03:10:55] <brettgilio> Is the lack of DCC file support a design choice of The Lounge?
[03:11:34] <brettgilio> nvm did some searching
[03:11:46] <brettgilio> its just largely infeasible with browsers
[03:13:23] <johncs> I think it's probably possible. The work around WebRTC has done the heavy lifting.
[03:14:30] <brettgilio> could you explain more johncs?
[03:18:15] <johncs> brettgilio: WebRTC allows web browsers to directly connect to each other and send data. When I said that just now I didn't realize DCC was an actual standard and different clients are generally able to share files with each other. I naive implementation of file sharing via The Lounge using WebRTC would not be compatible with other DCC clients. But
[03:18:15] <johncs> it might be possible to interact with other DCC clients depending on the details of WebRTC and the details of DCC, neither of which I'm familiar enough with to say.
[03:19:03] <johncs> So I should've really said "I think it might be possible. WebRTC might be flexible enough."
[03:19:12] <brettgilio> It sounds like a massive maintenance burden...
[03:19:48] <johncs> Yeah I'm sure not gonna do it üòÇ. The Lounge's current strategy of "upload the file to the server that's hosting me and I'll serve it" is way simpler and works great.
[03:20:00] <johncs> I feel like DCC would only be nice for huge files.

[03:46:46] <artico> johncs, Thanks, I solved it through iptables. I have limited the number of connections coming from the ircd server and from port 6667 to my server with thelounge host, this does not allow to have connections beyond the limit. I'm writing a script that dynamically increases and decreases the number of active connections, using the ss -4 command,
[03:46:46] <artico> listing the tcp connections from the source ip. In the configuration file I have blocked lockNetwork so I do not allow the addition of new ircd. In this way I hope to provide access to the ircd without managing adding users and limiting abuse

[17:50:57] <artico> that is config.js
[17:51:18] <Activ8> have you set the permissions so that the lounge can read the .pem files?
[17:51:49] <artico> yes for test i set full permission
[17:52:03] <artico> lrwxrwxrwx 1 lounge lounge   43 Nov  1 13:38 privkey.pem -> ../../archive/domain.com/privkey1.pem
[17:53:00] <Activ8> the .pem certs are stored in /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/ right?
[17:53:29] <artico> the user the lounge is owner dir /etc/letsencrypt/
[17:53:33] <artico> is correct
[17:53:48] <artico> yes* is stored inside
[17:55:33] <bookworm> congratulations, all your certs are now potentially compromised... rotate them
[17:57:00] <artico> but I start now ...and working properly in ngnix
[17:58:35] <Activ8> they only need read by the lounge user/group not write

[18:04:22] <artico> I delete certificate and start again certbot
[18:06:43] <Activ8> you shouldn't need too, the permissions just needs to be set correctly on that file so that the lounge can read the certificate 
[18:07:43] <xnaas> If you're already using nginx as a reverse proxy...you don't really need thelounge to do any TLS.
[18:10:14] <artico> xnaas I use sudomain with different ip to domain is in other server
[18:11:10] <redoc> Guys, unless I am missing it, what is the minimum system requirements for this irc chat client?
[18:11:33] <redoc> I am going to spin up a container solely for this
[18:12:15] <xnaas> The biggest recourse requirement would be RAM, but you can get RAM usage fairly low if you limit the amount of messages kept in RAM, I guess.
[18:12:37] <redoc> 4GB plenty? 8GB?
[18:13:54] <xnaas> 4GB is beyond enough. My thelounge container is only using 372MB of RAM with maxHistory set to 10000. iirc that's up to 10k messages per channel stored in RAM.
[18:14:13] <xnaas> If you're in a lot of large, active channels, you'll want to lower that maxHistory value significantly, probably.
[18:14:26] <xnaas> (if you need to keep RAM usage down)
[18:15:01] <redoc> ok ill give it 1GB then
