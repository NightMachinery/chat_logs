[11:15:07] <Irenes> have you played Continuum (not to be confused with the late-90s game by the same name)?
[11:15:14] <jjuran> I have!
[11:15:23] <Irenes> I very much love that System's Twilight is the top item
[11:15:27] <Irenes> I paid money for that in the day
[11:15:38] <Irenes> it was like three weeks worth of lunch money, I had to save up by skipping meals
[11:15:56] <Irenes> (which is a bad idea and I don't recommend it but I wasn't able to eat every day anyway so skipping meals felt like a normal thing to do)
[11:16:34] <Irenes> are you the author of this?
[11:18:51] <jjuran> Of AMS?  Yes.
[11:19:10] <Irenes> it is a super cool project
[11:19:13] <jjuran> thanks
[11:19:49] <Irenes> I'd love to hear more about the "bitmapped terminal abstraction"
[11:19:59] <Irenes> like what the interface is between the front and back
[11:21:53] <jjuran> There's basically a framebuffer in a file
[11:22:06] <Irenes> oh interesting
[11:22:11] <jjuran> The format is called SKIF: Simple, Kinetic Image Format
[11:22:33] <imode> is that a standard format?
[11:22:47] <jjuran> No, I made it up :-)
[11:22:50] <imode> heh.
[11:23:05] <Irenes> I like the name
[11:23:11] <jjuran> thanks
[11:28:19] <imode> "generic bitmapped terminal abstraction", what's that mean exactly?
[11:34:07] <jjuran> imode: It means that it handles updating a bitmapped display along with receiving mouse and keyboard input.
[11:34:56] <imode> ah so it's just a frontend.
[11:35:19] <imode> it's not like a new kind of terminal device, just something that can take a bitmap.

[11:40:17] <jjuran> Irenes: By default, Continuum crashes with a black screen, but specifying a 68020, it launches.  It crashes on game start because the SoundDCE low memory global is unimplemented.  I fixed that, and gameplay works. :-)
[11:41:08] <jjuran> It crashes when I try to quit, though :-P
[11:42:10] <Irenes> interesting!
[11:42:14] <Irenes> haha

[15:34:41] <wink> ymdatta[m]: who knows if C++ got ISO-certified because it already had enough traction or if most of the post-ISO-traction came form the certification? esp. as there are so many compilers and it seems hit or miss (from an outsiders perspective) how good they are with quick and correct adoption. Also esp. the field where C++ is used there isn't so much competizion, so how would you compare?
[15:35:37] <wink> ymdatta[m]: finally, I think the domain of use greatly represents if "quick updates" or "stability > all" is key, so that's another thing that could be completely opposite. Think embedded versus SaaS/Web

[23:26:00] <aleph> Only have it set up in the bedroom however
[23:26:11] <aleph> Don't need that high an energy bill
[23:26:16] <ngoldbaum> ugh hope pnw people can stay cool
[23:26:23] <ngoldbaum> it’s gorgeous here today

[23:47:00] <gerikson> omg the idiots at Techrights are unironically talking about Big Foss
[23:48:05] <meff[m]> if anyone needs to stay cool, a DIY swamp cooler can help
[23:48:11] <meff[m]> (or you can buy fancy ones)
[23:48:31] <meff[m]> I've found good luck with a towel whose bottom is in a bucket of water, and the rest is draped in front of a box fan

[23:52:28] <manicennui> We had a several decades long experiment that showed that was a complete shitshow for most users.
[23:52:28] <maskd> I'm in the pocket of Big Floss
[23:52:47] <technomancy> mozilla is in the pocket of big foss
[23:52:58] <manicennui> Most users are far better off with the current model, other than the bullshit that Apple does to hurt competitors.
[23:53:09] <gerikson> manicennui:
[23:53:12] <gerikson> agreed
[23:53:18] <manicennui> And the threats are greater than ever.

[23:55:23] <manicennui> The Linux desktop situation is still a shitshow too, which is even worse if you are using a device with low power usage requirements.
[23:57:01] <manicennui> Unless a company like Google and device manufacturers take care of those problems for your specific device.
[23:57:40] <manicennui> Arguably you can go a long way by relying on Ubuntu, but its not in the same ballpark as Windows 10 and OS X.
[23:59:31] <gerikson> Ubuntu is Big FOSS though
[23:59:37] <gerikson> it has systemd
[23:59:40] <gerikson> and a CoC
[23:59:40] <manicennui> heh
[23:59:53] <gerikson> and is ok with Rust
