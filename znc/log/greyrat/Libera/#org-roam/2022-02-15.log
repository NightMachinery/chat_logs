[00:17:51] <konubinix> Ok, I get it. I can share mine. In my android phone, I use hypothesis to take quotes and comments on web sites

[00:18:53] <konubinix> And Librera PRO (from fdroid) for pdfs
[00:19:41] <konubinix> To the best of my knowledge, Librera is the only FOSS pdf reader on android that provide text selection
[00:19:54] <konubinix> Then, from librera, I share to Orgzly
[00:21:23] <konubinix> Now, in my PC, my web browser is qutebrowser. It allows to run arbitrary scripts and zathura for pdf thzat also provide a (very basic) way of triggering a script
[00:22:29] <konubinix> When reading websites, I can directly call emacsclient with the appropriate selected region and url to create a note
[00:23:34] <konubinix> In zathura, when selecting a text, it is automaticzlky put to the clipboard, so the script I configured uses xclip to get it and then call emacsclient as well
[00:24:36] <konubinix> Then, to get the notes fro: my phone, I use hypothesis.el to gather my phone note from hypothesis and have a command to put those quotes in appropiate roam nodes
[00:25:19] <konubinix> And, using git-annex, I have folders synced with my phone, so that I can retrieve the pdf note from orgzly 
[00:25:48] <konubinix> I think I told about everything I use :-)
[00:26:29] <konubinix> Then, my roam nodes at first are just aggregates of quotes, like this https://konubinix.eu/braindump/posts/2b837d86-c5c3-4d51-b03a-134373bc0427/?title=theorie_argumentative_du_raisonnement
[00:27:37] <konubinix> But when I consolidate them, I had opinions, interpretations and structure, it then looks likesthis https://konubinix.eu/blog/posts/ae37b219-5eb7-41d7-9687-5a52fb9821f1/?title=what_should_i_put_into_those_scopes_and_access_tokens_claims
[00:28:13] <konubinix> I assume that at some point, I will consider the content as ready enough, so that I can tag it evergreen

[00:30:51] <konubinix> Does this help ,
[00:30:53] <konubinix> ?
[00:33:29] <eugercek> Thanky you so much. I'm searching programs you mentioned. 
[00:34:08] <eugercek> Can you find your notes realted to a book x at any point? I afraid of losing the resource I get the ideas.
[00:34:26] <eugercek> Also very good setup of yours :D
[00:35:23] <konubinix> I've not read to-be-quoted books since I've been playing with roam
[00:35:56] <konubinix> But I've tried simply taking photpraphs, with mitigated success
[00:37:12] <konubinix> https://konubinix.eu/braindump/8abbd0ea-635e-4d03-8c2d-f6587d544a5b?title=aisance%5Fcognitive
[00:37:33] <konubinix> But I don't like this
[00:38:48] <eugercek> Hard to search
[00:39:19] <eugercek> Btw I'm taking notes about your note taking to improve my note taking :D
[00:42:25] <eugercek> I probably shouldn't ask this and just read, I'll, How to take smart notes. But I write everything I don't know in books. And I read mostly web dev only I couldn't convince  myself that thse should be notes. Do you have any restriction strategy?
[01:05:29] <konubinix> I don't
[01:06:44] <konubinix> But that's the beauty of it: you don't know the note will be useful until it suddenly is
[01:07:39] <konubinix> And most of the stimuli you are confronted to won't become notes.
[01:08:20] <konubinix> I guess ypu have to be in peace with that 
[01:08:48] <konubinix> Also, I realize I seldom take notes at my first reading
[01:09:58] <konubinix> But one day I realize that I have a question, my second brains says it does not know the topic but my biological brain remembers some book/web site/thesis about that stuff
[01:10:19] <konubinix> Then, I read it again, at take the notes that answer my question
[01:10:46] <konubinix> Recently, I wondered wheter HATEOAS is actually in the initial REST documents
[01:10:58] <konubinix> I read the thesis with that in mind
[01:11:14] <konubinix> And I'm at the state of bag of quotes -> https://konubinix.eu/braindump/posts/9c105b00-c13b-43f3-96e3-f74fd65b6935/?title=representational_state_transfer
[01:12:25] <konubinix> IIUC, the idea is that with time, my second brain becomes a conversation partner that tells me ancient stuff I believed and forgot
[01:12:40] <konubinix> hence I try to make the habit of nicely asking it
[01:13:46] <konubinix> Fun story, last month, I told my opinion about organizing git repos with colleagues
[01:14:21] <konubinix> I then suggested they read my written opinion https://konubinix.eu/braindump/posts/4e310528-a716-4639-96ad-0cc5dcb2854d/?title=pragmatic_git_workflow
[01:14:46] <konubinix> They read it and then told me it did not say the same as I just told them
[01:14:56] <eugercek> :D
[01:15:10] <konubinix> I read the note and realized my past self was much more inspired than I was
[01:15:45] <konubinix> My conversation partner convinced me of something
[01:16:06] <konubinix> That was like an epiphany of the conversation partner thing
[01:16:24] <eugercek> Totally get "stuff I believed and forgot" this. 
[01:16:34] <konubinix> :-)
[01:17:23] <konubinix> The network of small concept nodes with bidirectional links helps a lot getting to that old wisdom
[01:17:28] <eugercek> It's very abstract concept, I hope I overwhelmed myself 2 times. I hope I find a way to keep taking notes and don't feet unproductive.
[01:17:55] <konubinix> I tend to use gtd heavily
[01:18:32] <eugercek> I thinkg org is gateway drug for gtd and second brain.
[01:18:32] <konubinix> So, as long as I know my options and feel confident not doing what I'm not doing, I'm good with taking notes
[01:19:22] <konubinix> Otherwise, I just stop taking notes and feel also good then
[01:20:12] <konubinix> My second brain end up being a big bag of random unfinished thoughts, but in there, there definitely are useful stuff
[01:21:00] <konubinix> To me, gtd helps a lot renegotiating ones engagements and feel good with realizing I won't do this or that note after all
[01:21:09] <konubinix> That, and stoicism I guess
[01:21:33] <eugercek> Probably the reason I feel very bad is I don't read my notes again!
[01:22:21] <konubinix> Indeed, you might want to challenge the reason why you wrote them in that case
[01:24:18] <konubinix> I think making a habit of asking them for information is one key of a meaningful system
[01:24:44] <konubinix> And filling the lack of answer by a note answering the question
[01:25:08] <konubinix> This is definitely where I'm going right now
[01:25:42] <konubinix> Epistemic modesty, then asking the system, then filling cache misses with consolidated notes
[01:25:46] <eugercek> What do you think about deleting part of notes? Do you delete often, for densening notes
[01:25:46] <konubinix> rinse and repeat
[01:26:16] <konubinix> I take a look at one random node a day
[01:26:25] <konubinix> If I feel so, I delete
[01:26:40] <konubinix> In general, I consolidate or just keep
[01:26:57] <konubinix> With 5K nodes, it still ok
[01:27:08] <eugercek> Very good to hear!
[01:27:18] <konubinix> To me, it's like a second brain
[01:27:41] <konubinix> A lot of useless junks and a few nuggets
[01:27:52] <eugercek> While I'm transitioning org roam I'll delete and densen stuff.
[01:28:08] <konubinix> I guess the junks somehow help making the nuggets 
[01:30:46] <dcunit3d> hmmm interesting convo
[01:31:20] <dcunit3d> konubinix: have you used Google Repo?
[01:31:39] <konubinix> My default choice is to leave junks. They do no harm and who knows whether they might prove valuable in the future?
[01:31:49] <konubinix> dcunit3d: No
[01:32:13] <konubinix> repo, as in the multi git tool that is used in android ?
[01:32:18] <dcunit3d> repo seems like it might be a heavy handed for the git flow that you mentioned in your blog https://android.googlesource.com/tools/repo
[01:32:20] <dcunit3d> yes
[01:33:05] <konubinix> Yes, once mike ten years ago
[01:33:19] <konubinix> Trying to build android from scratch
[01:33:20] <dcunit3d> i want to find a way to combine repo with orgit and org-roam, so i can get captures of snippets from git branches checked out via the default.xml 
[01:34:17] <dcunit3d> but maybe orgit isn't what i'm looking for, since it links to magit buffers. https://github.com/magit/orgit
[01:34:42] <konubinix> Somehow, I never managed to like magit
[01:35:16] <dcunit3d> it would be nice to have a capture template that doesn't link to a currently checked out git repo, but instead links to a commit hash (+ metadata about git branch) that doesn't go stale. that way, i can capture code snippets and put them in org files
[01:35:38] <konubinix> You can create whatever links you want in org-mode
[01:35:39] <dcunit3d> i have a setup linked that allows me to do this, but the links go stale when files move. 
[01:36:42] <dcunit3d> i mean i have a setup with using file linking that allows me to browse source like this. it works for multiple default.xml files in google repo
[01:37:07] <dcunit3d> i think my setup is a bit too heavy handed for most though.

[11:36:21] <konubinix> dcunit3d: I encourage you to look at the code of orgit to realize it is not a big deal to create org-mode links
[11:36:51] <konubinix> To me, your issue is ontological rather than technical. This is in my opinion the most difficult part 
[11:37:39] <konubinix> Decide what needs to be done, that's to say in your case what would it be like to capture the link and to get back to it
[11:37:52] <konubinix> Then, I think you can craft something easily with org-store-link
[11:38:35] <konubinix> And of course, you will have to make assumptions about the environment in which the code is run, for a start you might want to assume repo is installed for instance
[11:39:24] <konubinix> To create the links to slack, it did not take me more than a few hours
[11:39:31] <konubinix> https://github.com/ag91/ol-emacs-slack
[11:41:07] <konubinix> The code is far from perfect, but I hope you get the idea
