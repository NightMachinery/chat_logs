[03:44:45] <Affliction> zstd <3
[03:44:48] <Voxel> eharmonic, > `2.0` compression ratio: https://i.imgur.com/ZY5o6ge.png
[03:45:00] <Voxel> From this one: https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/releases/tag/4.0.0
[03:45:04] <gog> the compression ratio is original size * 1/ratio
[03:45:12] <gog> or rather the inverse of that operation
[03:45:26] *** beaver is now known as Guest01
[03:45:27] <gog> so a compression ratio of 2 is 1/2 the size
[03:45:30] <Voxel> gog, there is difference between source and result
[03:45:31] <Affliction> compressed size is 300M vs 150M uncompressed, that's the question.
[03:45:32] <znf> compression ratio = uncompressed / compressed
[03:45:39] <Voxel> So, it's literally ~+100% of the size
[03:45:57] <Affliction> I'm gonna take a look at that zip file
[03:45:58] <Voxel> Affliction, it was not a question, but statement.

[03:46:22] <D20diceroller> such compression is going to make downloading files off the BBS a breeze
[03:46:24] <znf> Affliction, because zip/deflate is antique
[03:46:25] <eharmonic> i don't know anything about generations but i use tar -J xz for compression - slow compressing but pretty quick uncompressing and the smallest compression i can get - though gz is stream

[03:46:41] <znf> many files

[03:47:17] <gog> znf: most likely
[03:47:38] <Affliction> ok, 7zip says the packed size is 135M, unpacked size is 157M, physical size is 323M
[03:47:44] <letalis> hi, i have a vm with gnome boxes which always starts with the wrong resolution. is there a way to set a script or cronjob that changes the resolution automatically every time i start the vm?
[03:47:55] <letalis> i am on fedora 35 and the vm is fedora security lab
[03:47:56] <Affliction> so, the first one owuld be explained by deflate not seeing all the files
[03:48:08] <D20diceroller> eharmonic: lol!
[03:48:10] <Affliction> the filenames are pretty long too
[03:48:23] <znf> Affliction, most likely you have 4k blocks filesystem, so if the files are 2K, on the disk they'll actually use 4K
[03:48:43] <Affliction> zip does not have block alignment internally
[03:48:49] *** Joins: newpy (~newpy@206.168.231.90)
[03:49:04] <Affliction> I'm guessing, it's the duplicate metadata with very long filenames
[03:49:10] <gog> i thought zip could make use of a global dictonary?
[03:49:14] <gog> maybe that was something else
[03:49:16] <Affliction> it has both
[03:49:31] <Affliction> central directory at EOF which contains some of the info in the local file headers, which precede each file

[07:57:50] <CaesarNaykid> hey everyone. Quick Question. which distro would you say would be the best one to run for a system with an nVidia graphics card and muliti monitors. I've heard AMD is better but it's too late, i already have an nVidia 3070, but don't plan to use it for gaming, I just want to make sure it won't have stability issues with that. Curious what your recommendations are

[09:07:49] <pnbeast> Yep, it is.
[09:08:00] <Mister_Magister> Question. If i were to get NVMe drive, which would be more beneficial. If i put / root on it and /home on ssd it sure would boot up faster but once all services are running there isn't really any performance boost because all user-space software, even though executables are stored on root (/usr) the config is stored in home directory so i think that after boot there would be like no performance boost. Contrary to that if i were to
[09:08:02] <Mister_Magister> use nvme as /home then all the userspace programs, while loading the executable from root, they would load and do all the runtime changes in the /home so in the nvme which would be bigger performance boost i think
[09:08:39] <Mister_Magister> the other thing to consider is the capacity of the drive. NVMe are usually pricier so the idea is to put root on it and use ssd (bigger storage) on /home because /home ends up bigger

[15:10:42] <phogg> The first thing to learn is that you can never really learn Linux. It moves too fast, by the time you've learned it all something has changed and you have to learn that, too.
[15:10:58] <phogg> In that way we are all always constantly learning Linux. That's what keeps it fun.
[15:11:04] <invra> ull never learn it all. give up on that thinking
[15:11:49] <nomagno> You don't necessarily need to keep learning at breakneck pace
[15:12:04] *** Joins: thorre (~thorre@user/thorre)
[15:12:37] <nomagno> It's very likely someone is supporting some old way of doing stuff that they, like you, prefer. In that way it's all very open-ended and diverse
[15:12:45] <invra> also it really depends on what "learning linux" means to you. Can be replacing windows with linux as a regular desktop user.. or you want to dive into the nitty gritty
[15:12:57] <phogg> All that said, there are fundamentals that change slowly (or rarely), and a general knowledge of them will get you far if you learn nothing else. Unix and its design philosophy, the general layering of components, things like that.
[15:13:04] <nomagno> The kernel is a monolith, but the userspace is a bazaar

[22:29:43] <keir> akk: it's Ctrl-Meta-V by default
