[05:03:22] <foo> Sure? I'm confused by your statement. eg. we saw some CSS with a CSS class that's not used. Is there a way to search for a string of text to see when it was last altered by a CSS commit? git blame shows me what is present, I'm looking for something like that but I can search past commits and see when something might have been deleted

[14:56:02] <stenno> good day, i have a question regarding .gitignore. I have a folder in my 'root' directory called 'vendor', which i want to ignore. however, in my folder structure, there are other folders named 'vendor' which i do not want to ignore. I added `/vendor/` to my .gitignore, but `git status` still lists files inside /vendor/**. how can ignore the 'vendor' folder inside my root directory and all its
[14:56:04] <stenno> children?
[14:56:30] <osse> stenno: lists them in what way?
[14:56:31] *** Joins: mallkrampus (~mallkramp@148.72.164.119)
[14:56:37] <stenno> osse: 'new file'
[14:56:56] <osse> stenno: git check-ignore -v  path/to/one/of/them
[14:57:26] <stenno> no output
[14:58:00] <osse> git ls-files -- path/to/one/of/them
[14:58:40] <stenno> outputs the path
[14:58:51] <osse> then the file is tracked, and .gitignore does not apply
[14:58:56] <stenno> yes
[14:59:17] <stenno> my question was, how do i specify in gitignore to ignore the folder 'vendor' in my root directoryy
[14:59:35] <osse> If it is tracked, and you want it to be tracked, then you can't
[14:59:45] <stenno> i don't want it to be tracked.
[14:59:58] <osse> then git rm --cached vendor && git commit -m "Remove vendor folder"
[15:00:00] <stenno> i want it to be ignored
[15:00:43] <stenno> ok and this will only remove the tracking for the 'vendor' in my root folder, not 'vendor' in other subfolders
[15:00:44] <stenno> ?
[15:00:53] <osse> yes
[15:00:58] <stenno> thx
[15:01:18] <stenno> oh wow that was a lot of output
[15:01:32] <stenno> worked like a charm, osse, thanks
[15:01:38] <stenno> even though i don't really know why ...
[15:01:46] <osse> note that now other clones won't get that folder at all
[15:01:53] <stenno> hmm
[15:02:01] <stenno> thats fine
[15:02:16] <stenno> if i wanted it to be empty, i'd have to use .gitkeep right
[15:02:32] <osse> .gitignore is for avoiding adding crap to git, but it does not avoid subsequent changes to files already added to git
[15:03:00] <osse> any file will do. You can for example put .gitignore with '*' inside it. That way you don't have to deal with vendor in the top-level .gitignore
[15:03:01] <stenno> i thought they weren't added yet as git listed them as 'new file'
[15:03:14] <stenno> ooh nice one!
[15:03:24] <stenno> i will do it like that, thats great, thanks

[16:45:42] <Anticom> Hi folks. I'm not entirely sure whether this is considered on topic but I'm gonna give it a shot. We've got a repo that we're using as a mono-repo for some php packages which in turn had some submodules to js packages. So basically the layout is <project repo> -[has submodule]-> <mono repo> -[has submodule(s)]-> <js package repo>

[16:46:31] <Anticom> Now due to some changes in our project we don't need the js submodules in the mono repo anymore. I used this guide ( https://stackoverflow.com/a/1260982/966530 ) to remove the submodules from the mono-repo.
[16:47:02] <Anticom> The issue now is, that our GitLab CI still seems to think that those old and removed submodules are present somewhere and hence the build is failing
[16:47:41] <Anticom> Any ideas whether there are known bugs with GitLab or maybe I did something wrong while removing the submodules? If so where do I need to look for issues in my working copies?

[16:48:42] <rapha> is there a way to tell git to output non-error/non-warning messages on stdout instead of stderr?
[16:48:58] <Anticom> The project repo only shows the mono-repo as submodule and if I cd into the mono-repo and repeat the submodule status I only get the remainding submodules I actually want in there. But in the CI log it's trying to initialize the old and removed submodules still
[16:49:20] <dminuoso> Anticom: The sheer amount of issues we've had with nested submodules and gitlab ci was astonishing
[16:49:36] <cbreak> Anticom: are the submodules up to date?
[16:49:45] <selckin> doesn't submodules mean you don't have a monorepo, or did i miss a memo
[16:49:50] <cbreak> or do they show up in git status as having different commits?

[16:52:05] <Anticom> Hm I just noticed those are only warnings and the actual error is with the 3rd submodule. I'm using relative paths in my .gitmodules. Maybe I did something wrong there.
[16:52:09] <selckin> i was thinking as the concept where you bundle the source of every single dependency and build everything for a single rpeo, made popular by google
[16:52:37] <cbreak> mono is a microsoft technology

[18:07:37] <selckin> you can't gitignore tracked files, so you need to remove them, stage the remove (git rm; git add -u); and commit
[18:07:45] <noord> djowens: git rm

[18:11:30] <djowens> selckin, removing from all of history would be good if possible
[18:12:09] <selckin> !rewrite
[18:12:09] <gitinfo> Rewriting public history is not recommended. Everyone who has pulled the old history will have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push --force-with-lease <remote> <branch>` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum
[18:12:14] <selckin> !remove
[18:12:14] <gitinfo> [!remove_commit] You can use rebase to remove commits: git rebase --onto <commit>~1 <commit> <branch>. Note this will !rewrite history.
[18:12:22] <selckin> hmm whats the magic command
[18:12:44] <selckin> !filter
[18:12:44] <gitinfo> [!filters] Filters can be very useful for automatically making changes to files at checkout(smudge) and checkin/add(clean). See 'man gitattributes' for more information

[21:01:39] <ksynwa> Hello. I am hosting my git repos on a vps that I use ssh to interact with. On the vps, I created the repository using `git init --bare -b=main repo.git`. Then I pushed to it from my local machine using `git push origin main` where origin is set to git@vps:repo.git. But when I clone `git clone git@vps:repo.git`, the branch that is checked out by default is master. Does anyone know why this is
[21:01:41] <ksynwa> happening?

You can't edit them directly (trying to check them out results in a !detached HEAD), but you can create a local branch based on a remote-tracking branch using e.g. 'git checkout -b <branch> <remote>/<branch>'
