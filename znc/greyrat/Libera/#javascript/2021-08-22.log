[01:01:32] <bugweiser> all I know is that there was a pmwiki channel on freenode, but msg alis lists nothing for pmwiki on libera. Sven_vB appears to be a maintainer of an outh-package for pmwiki, and listed this channel as on his profile-page on pmwiki.

[02:20:44] <ThePendulum> is that useful for anything when you have a digital archive with a search engine?

[02:21:47] <Alexendoo> It can be yeah
[02:22:19] <Alexendoo> You can't search for stuff you don't know about, a list of everything would include that (whether or not it's separated by letter)
[02:23:01] <ThePendulum> in my case I have a list of actors, I can see the argument for wanting to browse actors you haven't heard of, but if you're doing that it probably doesn't really matter what letter their name starts with
[02:23:20] <GreenJello> ThePendulum, oh, you meant an actual library full of books
[02:23:44] <Alexendoo> It doesn't, but in that case it's just an arbitrary way to break down the list into smaller chunks
[02:23:44] <ThePendulum> well a digital library of anything with indexable items
[02:24:09] <ThePendulum> in my case I have a list of actors, I can see the argument for wanting to browse actors you haven't heard of, but if you're doing that it probably doesn't really matter what letter their name starts with, but if you have a thing for actors starting with an 'G', I guess it could be added to the search engine
[02:24:30] <ThePendulum> guess I can at least reduce that interface to a dropdown or something, probably not used enough to spread it out like that
[02:25:16] <spynxic> Autocomplete not working?
[02:25:19] <GreenJello> or have a search field that special-cases 1 or 2 letter inputs
[02:25:59] <GreenJello> or with a toggle for only matching the start of a title
[02:26:01] <ThePendulum> spynxic: autocomplete inside the search bar? if for some reason you wanted all actors with a specific letter that's going to give way too many results
[02:26:33] <spynxic> Have it automatically aggregate results into categories
[02:26:33] <ThePendulum> GreenJello: guess that could work, if you're searching for 'A' you're probably not looking for any other part of their name

[02:46:36] <wroathe> Alexendoo: Otherwise you'd have to make your web project gracefully detect which protocol is available
[02:47:01] <Alexendoo> Which features?
[02:47:51] <wroathe> I'd have to look. Last time I reviewed the HTTP/2 documentation was like 5 years ago. I thought I remembered there being additional support for new request methods and http headers, among other things.
[02:48:02] <Alexendoo> It's generally transparent to the web application
[02:48:16] <Alexendoo> The http/2 bit would be done by nginx/apache/etc
[02:48:43] <wroathe> Yup. What I'm concerned with is client compatibility, and the impact it has on web applications running in that client.

[02:55:16] <GreenJello> http push is the main thing that isn't backwards compatible
[02:55:47] <GreenJello> but people just don't use that feature, and probably wouldn't even without backwards compatibility concerns
[02:56:31] <wroathe>  I don't remember where I got the idea that HTTP/2 was some kind of superset of HTTP with new methods, status codes, and headers. Maybe speculation before the initial release of the spec?

[16:00:25] <Ingvix> hey, I was just wondering if it'd better to access an element by querySelector or by manually going down the tree child by child if the element is always in the same location. And like withing the first few layers of children. It seems like it would be more efficient to go down the tree but I'm not quite sure
[16:00:27] <sillyslux__> not sure about node, but const and let don't create globals in a browser environment like var does
[16:00:44] <Ingvix> just wondering abour best policies
[16:01:07] <sillyslux__> ross have you tried setting breakpoints?

[16:01:50] <sillyslux__> Ingvix, you worried about performance?
[16:02:06] <ross> sillyslux__: I ended up just temporarily switching it out for `module.exports` :P
[16:02:08] <sillyslux__> better go the elegant way
[16:02:56] <Ingvix> I have some tendency to take the optimized route even if it isn't prettier
[16:03:22] <Ingvix> or resource-wise necessary
[16:03:27] <sillyslux__> even if the gains are neglectible?

[16:03:54] <theskillwithin> querySelector is my answer

[16:05:06] *** Joins: gggp (~textual@60.10.23.160)
[16:05:11] <Ingvix> no, I just felt logical that a search would be slower than a set path
[16:05:19] <sillyslux__> best practice is a universal solution, one that adapts to changes later and more readable code
[16:05:42] <sillyslux__> so querySelector it is then
[16:06:01] <Ingvix> hmm, yes, I guess I'll go with that in this case then

[20:55:33] <austincheney> hello mikrosis
[20:55:51] <mikrosis> so when I want to connect to a WebSocket server with a browser (JavaScript) - that websocket server needs HTTPS encryption, right?
[20:56:35] <sept> Thanks austincheney. I'll try using that.
[20:57:32] <austincheney> sept, it will take some effort but it looks like set method is what you need for merging typedarrays https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray/set
[20:58:07] <austincheney> mikrosis, if the page is https the websocket must also be encrypted and thus wss protocol.
[20:58:19] <austincheney> if the page is just http then the websocket can use wither ws or wss protocols
[20:58:21] <austincheney> brb
[20:59:58] <sept> So, maybe the best way to do this is use + to concatenate the Uint8Arrays into one string and then use a constructor for Uint8Array to change the type?

[22:16:31] <GreenJello> it limits the damage of leaking the access token
[22:17:19] <Slade> can you elaborate on that?
[22:17:22] <doc> Slade: think about the entire process. If your user is compromised then you can let the jwt expire, but they'll need the refresh token to get a new jwt token. You then have the ability to expire a refresh token

[22:19:04] <GreenJello> yeah, what doc said, then

[22:21:27] <GreenJello> and access tokens are short-lived
[22:21:47] <doc> not exactly, it's worth looking at how jwts are made if you want to understand the details, but the gist is there's a public/private key setup and the auth token is encoded in a way the access token checks can be offloaded to the servers without hitting the db. Eventually though, for safety, you want to do a periodic check in that the user's access isn't revoked, and that's where the refresh comes in

[22:50:50] <Slade> doc, hum  using refresh tokens to lockout websocket sessions isnt useful :/
[22:51:14] <Slade> just stops new sessions
[22:52:21] <GreenJello> Slade, you could still use it there. You get the refresh token on connection, and you can periodically check if it's revoked, and if so, terminate the websocket
[22:54:56] <doc> Not a problem I've solved yet personally, would have to have server side handling for that too
[22:55:01] <doc> can't trust the client
[22:57:42] <Slade> yea
[22:57:53] <Slade> that gets involved with 3rd party server ;P
[22:58:01] <Slade> err well. its open source. so i guess i can mod that
[22:58:02] <Slade> but grr
[22:58:27] <doc> yeah, it's a problem I need to address at some point, and now I'm annoyed
[22:58:43] <Slade> yea?
[22:59:20] <doc> mildly, it just means I need to find some way to track sessions to users and close them off, whatever that involves... asyncio stuff is... magic right now to me.

[23:00:31] <Slade> authuentication becomes a pain after you've got multiple client types and multiple server platforms trying to cooperate
[23:00:58] <doc> sounds like you want some sort of single sign on thing
[23:01:09] <doc> maybe
[23:01:31] <Slade> not even single signon. i just have  c# app doing lots of the work. and i have hasura doing the graphql/websockets
[23:01:55] <Slade> the JWT provides access to everything. just need to pass and handle them professionally
