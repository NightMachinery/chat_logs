[01:40:29] <vegii> what for?
[01:40:53] <MootPoot> I have a 2.5g connection from my modem to my wifi AP
[01:41:02] * Jigsy drinks his own Wakamezake.
[01:41:03] <vegii> either move to shielded cat7 or go full fiber

[01:42:17] <vegii> world of pain
[01:42:22] <ButterNoodle> how so?
[01:42:29] <MootPoot> but I think the main thing was that crappy coax I was using
[01:42:38] <MootPoot> the modems SnR values are a lot happier now
[01:42:48] <ButterNoodle> 10g over rj45 is common now
[01:42:57] <vegii> eeeek
[01:43:03] <MootPoot> 700 up to 850 mbit*
[01:43:05] <ButterNoodle> I mean a datacenter standard
[01:43:06] <MootPoot> I should have said
[01:43:18] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: yes.. shitty coax
[01:43:34] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: that old cable it took like 2min for the modem to connect upstream...this new one literally 5 seconds
[01:43:41] <ButterNoodle> lol
[01:43:49] <ButterNoodle> amazon basics cable ftw
[01:43:55] <vegii> oof
[01:43:58] <MootPoot> amazonbasics was the cat6
[01:44:04] <MootPoot> I used cable matters for the coax
[01:44:22] <ButterNoodle> 1m< it really doesnt matter on the cable for 1g
[01:44:44] <MootPoot> I've seen people pull 10g on copper rj45 all day
[01:44:45] <ButterNoodle> I havent tried my luck w a 1m cat 3 on 10g
[01:44:53] <MootPoot> aside from the expensive NICs required
[01:44:55] <hassoon> anyone is an expact ?
[01:44:57] <MootPoot> its doable
[01:45:15] <hassoon> * expat
[01:45:23] <ButterNoodle> I mean its all how much crosstalk and attenuation u have on the cable

[01:45:50] <MootPoot> the higher the data rates the fuckier the cables
[01:46:16] <ButterNoodle> yea.. and running 10g over cat 3... probably run fine till u go over 1g of data
[01:46:27] <ButterNoodle> I have no 10g rj tho..
[01:46:37] <ButterNoodle> either twinax or mmf
[01:46:50] <ButterNoodle> I think I have some smf 10g optics somewhere in a box...

[01:48:48] <ButterNoodle> tru.. they are shit
[01:48:50] <ButterNoodle> never buy again
[01:49:16] <MootPoot> the newer ones seem somewhat better....but imo I'd rather just buy asus or something
[01:49:24] <MootPoot> msi is the budget gaming laptop
[01:49:36] <lastonestanding> MSI is good quality
[01:49:58] <MootPoot> from the people I've talked to and my own experience with MSI , they are kinda meh
[01:50:07] <MootPoot> not as bad as like HP
[01:50:15] <MootPoot> but still in the substandard category
[01:50:23] <vegii> lol, hp
[01:50:38] <lastonestanding> no way
[01:50:39] <lastonestanding> MSI is premium league
[01:51:18] <vegii> is asus premium league then?
[01:51:46] <lastonestanding> I would not rate them higher than msi
[01:51:49] <MootPoot> MSI slacks on build quality, updates, aftermarket support...I could go on

[02:15:09] <MootPoot> I should swap out that other coax then too...
[02:15:14] <ButterNoodle> probably
[02:15:20] <MootPoot> I have like a 20 ft coil just wrapped up
[02:15:25] <ButterNoodle> flatten it
[02:15:32] <MootPoot> the actual distance is like 2ft
[02:15:33] <ButterNoodle> zig zag and its fine
[02:18:33] <vegii> don't kink
[02:19:10] <ButterNoodle> tru.. coax min bend radius
[02:19:27] <MootPoot> wonder what the max bandwidth of coax is
[02:19:38] <MootPoot> I already shove like 2.5gbit through mine
[02:20:31] <MootPoot> my isp offers a max of 1.5gbit service over coax under 900mhz, and MoCa I get 1.5gbit more...with losses that's about 2.5 realistic

[02:25:16] <MootPoot> just was wondering
[02:25:44] <MootPoot> if I connect all 4 of those to the switch, and say I max out my throughput to one of the VM's through a LAN file transfer
[02:25:47] <ButterNoodle> with no "bundling" protocol or negotiation.. spanning should kill the other 3 links
[02:25:53] <MootPoot> huh
[02:25:55] <MootPoot> TIL
[02:26:14] <ButterNoodle> otherwise wo spanning tree it would loop the network
[02:26:23] <ButterNoodle> from esxi to the switch.. yes
[02:26:54] <MootPoot> There is no way to tell it "okay, this NAS VM uses 3/4 of the 1gbit conecctions so that it has 3gbit throughput to multiple clients"
[02:27:10] <ButterNoodle> you can do mac based load balancing on esxi and plain etherchannel on the switch
[02:27:12] <MootPoot> and let all the other VM's just use the last wire
[02:28:03] <ButterNoodle> that will just bind one mac to mac conversation to a cable
[02:28:14] <ButterNoodle> nope
[02:28:20] <ButterNoodle> nothing works that way..
[02:28:44] <MootPoot> hmm
[02:28:47] <MootPoot> okay
[02:28:51] <MootPoot> thanks for answering
[02:28:55] <ButterNoodle> software defined stuff can load balance based on a specific flow.. but we arent gonna be doing that at home
[02:29:58] <ButterNoodle> I mean what will happen.. if 3 different mac to mac conversations are happening the switch/esxi will try its best to put them on different links

[05:26:09] <dfch> davic yes
[05:26:12] <amigojapan> davic: how is bart?
[05:26:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Still an unaging skateboarding kid.
[05:27:29] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: I never was able to ride aa skateboard withought falling off
[05:27:29] <davic> amigojapan: bart died sir
[05:27:39] <amigojapan> ouch davic
[05:27:40] <davic> commited suicide by being in my office
[05:28:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: I was when I tried, but local street maintenance had me decide I didn't care much for it.
[05:28:23] <dfch> davic u got office already?
[05:28:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Being stuck in a small square that isn't potholes isn't great.
[05:28:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bikes, mountain bikes particularly, deal better with it.
[05:29:32] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose:wne I was a kid,, before videgames, what were popular were skateboards, tops and yoyos
[05:29:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah. I was just pragmatic and didn't feel like killing myself just to look cool.

[05:30:55] <ButterNoodle> bitch boi
[05:32:31] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: I wonder if a longboard is any easier to ride
[05:32:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Reportedly yes.
[05:32:42] <amigojapan> should be more stable
[05:33:01] <amigojapan> ah good
[05:35:39] <MootPoot> I went to the store and asked for a few feet then the girl at the counter told me to turn around and bend over
[05:36:22] <MootPoot> ... To pick up the stuff on the ground you dirty minded people 
[05:36:38] <ButterNoodle> few feet?
[05:36:41] <ButterNoodle> I love feet
[05:37:16] <MootPoot> How many feet is a few 
[05:37:45] <amigojapan> MootPoot: my dad used to say "a couple is two and a few is three"
[05:37:56] <amigojapan> but that seems too strict a definition
[05:38:29] <ButterNoodle> woah she had 3 feet?
[05:39:18] <amigojapan> my dad got angry at things like ppeople saying "this twon is 30 minutes away" he wanted to know the distance not the minutes
[05:39:50] <MootPoot> amigojapan: a couple of feet is 4
[05:39:54] <MootPoot> :3
[05:40:39] <amigojapan> two sets of feet
[05:41:17] <amigojapan> soon this girl will be spider girl
[05:41:27] <Fenderbassist> would make me laugh if someone saying "Look at the happy couple that just got married" involved 3 or more people
[05:41:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Going by most slav languages, 1 = 1, 1-4 = a few, 5 = some
[05:41:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *2-4
[05:41:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *5+
[05:42:21] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: but if someone say I will be a couple of minutes, and actually took 4 minutes, I dont think you owuld think they lies
[05:43:14] <Fenderbassist> sounds a little harsh and over reactive
[05:43:24] <Fenderbassist> to hold someone to that standard over such a little thing
[05:43:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Mind, it's not literal translation or anything, more illustrating that grammatically there's three categories. It's more CAt1 = 1, Cat2 = [2,4], Cat3 = [5,]
[05:43:29] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: personally now, I just take them as guidelines, not a strict numbers, couple , few some
[05:44:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You conjugate 1 dog, three dogs and dix dogs differently.
[05:44:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *six
[05:44:23] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I think my dad was too literal about words
[05:44:41] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: or maybe that was just a common practice for him and where he lived
[05:44:43] <amigojapan> I see Aurora_v_kosmose
[05:44:54] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: my parents would say a couple is two and a few is three or more
[05:45:20] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I see, that is simillar to my dad
[05:45:29] <Fenderbassist> was just common practice for them
[05:45:35] <amigojapan> I see
[05:45:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's kinda weird that a pair is so often called a couple, but couple otherwise never implies a pair.
[05:45:55] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: but three or mroe can be 500
[05:46:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ...nah wait
[05:46:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sometimes it does.
[05:46:24] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: so then you have to bring in common sense to the equation and decide that no one is likely to call a few 500
[05:46:46] <Fenderbassist> "I am going to the store to buy a few packets of Ramen" probably doesn't imply hundreds
[05:46:48] <amigojapan> alright
[05:46:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But coupling elements are more a logical relation between unstated numbers of components than an indication of how many.
[05:47:18] <Fenderbassist> if they come home with 12, it's not a crime
[05:47:23] <Fenderbassist> or a lie
[05:47:50] <Fenderbassist> anyway
[05:47:56] <Fenderbassist> did you have your coffee?
[05:48:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's a weird statement when there's no implication of logical relation and coupled use.
[05:48:08] <amigojapan> not yet Fenderbassist, let mep repare it
[05:48:14] <Fenderbassist> k
[05:48:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Languages are weird.
[05:48:24] <Fenderbassist> Aurora_v_kosmose: languages are weird
[05:48:28] <Fenderbassist> hehe
[05:49:17] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: anyway to a computer if( a >2) is 3 or more but wont complain if it is 500
[05:49:38] <Fenderbassist> I'm sure, I thought we were talking about people though
[05:49:46] <Fenderbassist> things vary with humans
[05:49:48] <amigojapan> true
[05:49:54] <Fenderbassist> they also have the right to change their mind midflight
[05:50:23] <Fenderbassist> and they also deserve understanding if circumstances interfered with their previously stated plans
[05:50:25] <amigojapan> yeah I agree
[05:50:35] <Fenderbassist> I mean, if you want people in your personal life
[05:50:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (cond ((>= number 5) 'many) ((>= number 2) 'fk-it-idk) ((<= number 1) 'one))
[05:51:05] <Fenderbassist> you can't be Landru (the computer from Star Trek OS that controlled a planet)
[05:51:17] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: also the definition of a bunch is pretty lose too
[05:51:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> 0 is one, of course.
[05:51:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> :p
[05:51:57] <Fenderbassist> fair enough
[05:52:15] <dfch> Of course
[05:52:17] <dfch> :3
[05:52:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I spent so long messing with Elisp I was somewhat sad when I noticed CL actually doesn't have pcase.
[05:53:02] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: a dozen can be literally 12, but can also be around 12
[05:53:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Now that's just weird.
[05:53:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> "A dozen or so" is approximation, but a dozen is specifically a grouping of 12.
[05:53:38] <Fenderbassist> and a baker's dozen is 13 I think?
[05:53:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Fenderbassist: What, are they indexing from 0 and overflowing?

[05:59:30] <amigojapan> so who knows how much you are buying
[06:00:36] <amigojapan> eggs come in packs of 10
[06:02:30] <Fenderbassist> I guess you have to "eyeball it"
[06:02:40] <Fenderbassist> judge visually and by weight in hand
[06:02:43] <amigojapan> yup
[06:03:23] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist:vegetables come in bunches, but bunchces vary insize form supermarket to supermarket
[06:03:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Keep an old pack of eggs, zero the scale with it, put new pack on.
[06:04:31] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: there are no scales either
[06:04:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Got to bring your own.
[06:05:21] <amigojapan> I guess Aurora_v_kosmose, but I odnt hink they would care if you complained that the ammount got smaller
[06:05:41] <amigojapan> maybe it would help to know which supermarket is better
[06:06:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If they underfed the chicken or tried to sell large eggs by including less than there is in the small eggs pack?
[06:06:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yes, the latter is effectively fraud.
[06:07:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I wouldn't put that kind of bullshit beyond some groc\eries here.
[06:07:48] <amigojapan> I find that a bunch of spinach is widely different form supermarket to spuermarket
[06:09:01] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: poor chickens
[06:09:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: It's one example. I'd more expect them to use the exact same small eggs & lie about it.
[06:10:24] <Fenderbassist> Aurora_v_kosmose: how are things going for you these days ?
[06:10:29] <amigojapan> ok Fenderbassist my coffee is ready

[06:22:59] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: with marijuana becommin legal in more and mroe states, is there a legal age for marijuana?
[06:23:11] <Fenderbassist> I believe it's 21
[06:23:14] <Fenderbassist> just like with alcohol
[06:23:16] <amigojapan> ah
[06:23:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Can get your skull aerated by angry farmers legally, but forget recreative drugs.
[06:23:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Got to love the sense of priorities.
[06:24:09] <Fenderbassist> lol
[06:24:30] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: I think it's a good trend, marijuana can be medicine for a lot of people
[06:25:23] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I hope so, tho marijuana is what triggered my anxiety disorder which I am still treating even today
[06:25:39] <bxgelsan> who pinged me
[06:25:51] <bxgelsan> and if so can they repeat what they said
[06:25:53] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: it affected me differnet from usual people
[06:25:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: That sounds... a bit much. Are you sure they weren't altered with something much less okay?
[06:26:06] <bxgelsan> not a big scrollback.
[06:26:10] <amigojapan> no I am not sure Aurora_v_kosmose
[06:26:13] <bxgelsan> minimalist.
[06:27:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I know that stock here got reported to be contaminated with other more addictive stuff. Which I suspect just led to people growing it themselves instead.
[06:27:37] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: sounds like what you sampled might have been treated
[06:27:55] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: that is sure plausable
[06:27:59] <Fenderbassist> bxgelsan: we are discussing mmj being legalized now more and more, and that I think it's a medicine
[06:28:13] <bxgelsan> ah
[06:28:20] <bxgelsan> well yeah
[06:28:26] <Fenderbassist> people use cannabis to treat anxiety
[06:28:27] <bxgelsan> :p
[06:28:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Most plants that stick around humans for so long in medical roles tend to have some sort of legitimate use.
[06:28:47] <Fenderbassist> so I am kinda surprised you feel it triggered yours, but I suppose it's possible
[06:29:03] <Fenderbassist> people do vary
[06:29:25] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: the Japanese doctor diagnosed it as being the cause
[06:29:44] <Fenderbassist> "you smoked a joint and this resulted in life long anxiety"?
[06:29:48] <Fenderbassist> something like that?
[06:30:00] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: a bong, but yet
[06:30:05] <Fenderbassist> hmmmm
[06:30:18] <Fenderbassist> I wonder if was more of an attitude than a diagnosis but hey

[06:30:25] <Fenderbassist> lol
[06:30:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Yes the rhyming is intentional)
[06:30:57] <bxgelsan> Fenderbassist: japan unless its changed, has a stance against it. due to lazy stereotype.
[06:31:08] <bxgelsan> its more socially acceptable to take some form of methamp
[06:31:20] <bxgelsan> than to smoke the devils lettuce
[06:31:41] <bxgelsan> :p
[06:31:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Japan seemingly has a stance against mental health in general. And most drugs other than alcohol (hell yeah, hard drugs get a pass).
[06:31:45] <Fenderbassist> bxgelsan: ah I see
[06:31:47] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: well, yeah Japan is kind of strict twords marijuana, recently they even have a law that makes it illegal for Japanese citizens to smoke marijuana even when they are not in Japan

[08:37:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ##anime is way too busy for me to bother with its logs
[08:37:37] <MootPoot> amigojapan: bascially everything gets dull over time - the trick is to find the thing that costs the least to replace
[08:37:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Well, I do sometimes skim them, but not read them through.
[08:38:36] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I think I will only shave like once per week, so that should let it survive more
[08:41:27] <MootPoot> or you could just get something that facilitates that rather then trying to reduce how much you shave or creating more e-waste...
[08:41:48] <MootPoot> that plastic shaver you have is just going to get landfilled
[08:42:00] <MootPoot> razor metal blades just rust away
[08:42:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Reducing how much you shave can still help. Clipping the beard would also create much less waste.
[08:42:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Electrolysis would solve the issue for good, but proportionally produce more e-waste.
[08:42:58] <MootPoot> the best method is just either keeping a beard and never shaving..or just using a single or double edge razor 
[08:43:01] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I am also lazy to do it more often
[08:43:18] <MootPoot> the only byproduct is just a used metal blade, no plastic
[08:43:26] <MootPoot> it'll rust away harmlessly in 5 years
[08:46:26] <amigojapan> MootPoot: shaving has to be done much more cafeully with a blade, this  takes 2 minutes and can be done dry

[09:50:52] <ButterNoodle> DunceCotus: does it matter if u expect a different result or an unpredictable result?
[09:51:06] <ButterNoodle> the problem is the expectation
[09:51:30] <DunceCotus> expecting a different result is only to be expected
[09:51:32] <ButterNoodle> if running out into traffic doesnt get you ran over 9 out of 10 times...
[09:51:41] <Altor> ButterNoodle: Understand.
[09:51:50] <DunceCotus> no two faps are the same
[09:51:53] <ButterNoodle> after u get ran over.. you might need to be institutionalized
[09:52:00] <DunceCotus> no two walks around the same block are the same
[09:52:01] <DunceCotus> etc.
[09:52:16] <ButterNoodle> idk man.. my aim is pretty consistent
[09:52:24] <ButterNoodle> then again I dont fap to the same thing twice..
[09:52:29] <DunceCotus> to expect a different result each time is reasonable imo
[09:52:33] <DunceCotus> even if its only slightly different
[09:52:35] <ButterNoodle> the whole internet is out there to fap to
[09:53:12] <DunceCotus> I get where Einstein is coming from but even Einstein can be wrong
[09:53:15] <ButterNoodle> imagine settling down with a house, picket fence, 2.5 kids, and a cat.... with just one photo...
[09:53:29] <ButterNoodle> yes
[09:53:33] <ButterNoodle> science can be wrong
[09:53:54] <DunceCotus> you can't repeat without there being difference
[09:54:16] <DunceCotus> you could argue well the difference is negligible but I don't think so
[09:54:24] <ButterNoodle> there is a thing called tolerance
[09:54:26] <DunceCotus> the slight differences matter
[09:54:30] <ButterNoodle> when u machine something
[09:54:33] <ButterNoodle> for example
[09:54:41] <DunceCotus> right
[09:54:48] <ButterNoodle> 2 parts can be considered identical based on tolerances
[09:54:55] <ButterNoodle> but
[09:55:00] <DunceCotus> and they have to actively account for errors/misalignments etc.
[09:55:05] <ButterNoodle> that is considered a repeatable result
[09:55:18] <ButterNoodle> just like say the LHC
[09:55:18] <DunceCotus> not perfectly repeatable
[09:55:44] <DunceCotus> another thing is how you interpret the result
[09:55:56] <DunceCotus> sometimes it takes many repetitions to interpret the same-ish result differently
[09:56:00] <ButterNoodle> those results are not perfectly repeatable yet those and pretty much all measures in the universe are open to tolerances
[09:56:26] <ButterNoodle> variance is acceptable in results
[09:56:34] <DunceCotus> just saying Einstein is wrong is all

[09:57:23] <S_T_A_N> Everyone must be right
[09:57:24] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: but I mean it isn't insane to expect a different result from repeated activity
[09:57:28] <S_T_A_N> Everyone must comply 
[09:57:28] <ButterNoodle> no S_T_A_N...
[09:57:30] <DunceCotus> because it will be different
[09:57:33] <ButterNoodle> everyone right is wrong
[09:57:34] <ButterNoodle> its 2022
[09:57:54] <DunceCotus> I think Einstein
[09:57:59] <ButterNoodle> thats not at all what he means...
[09:58:03] <DunceCotus> was more meaning to expect wildly different results

[09:59:04] <DunceCotus> still even though we can predict the sun will rise tomorrow, doesn't mean it is guaranteed to happen
[09:59:13] <DunceCotus> just cause something is repeated does not always entail the same result
[09:59:16] <DunceCotus> or same-ish even
[09:59:18] <ButterNoodle> irrelevant
[09:59:35] <DunceCotus> its entirely relevant to that quote

[09:59:37] <S_T_A_N> It always will. Until it won't. Until then it always will

[10:00:08] <ButterNoodle> can u educate DunceCotus on the finer points of logic?
[10:00:16] <DunceCotus> S_T_A_N: applies to everything
[10:00:20] <ButterNoodle> bc he still thinks the earth is flat
[10:00:34] <ButterNoodle> an satellites are held in place w sky hooks

[10:00:43] <S_T_A_N> ButterNoodle, the fuck
[10:00:54] <ButterNoodle> well its 1/2 true
[10:00:54] <DunceCotus> no I think satellites are a fantasy
[10:01:00] <ButterNoodle> ^
[10:01:04] <S_T_A_N> I can't engage with that level of retardation 
[10:01:07] <DunceCotus> satellite imagery comes from high-altitude planes
[10:01:33] <DunceCotus> GPS works via cell towers
[10:01:51] <ButterNoodle> S_T_A_N I have talked to people on the ISS w radio as they went overhead.. gg
[10:01:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yes but no.
[10:01:53] <S_T_A_N> > GPS works via thing that was invented after GPS
[10:02:01] <DunceCotus> we cannot exit the Earth's atmospheric manifold, not yet anyway
[10:02:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There are GPS relay modes
[10:02:19] <ButterNoodle> I had a ford escort with a cracked manifold
[10:02:28] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: that is just mental gymnastics to avoid the round earth
[10:02:44] <DunceCotus> there is 0 evidence for round Earth
[10:02:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> DunceCotus: yes, we know that phlogiston fills the space all the way to saturn, that's fine.
[10:03:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ah shit. s/phlogiston/ether/

[10:04:20] <DunceCotus> the heliocentric model is not that different from descriptions of planets as orbiting Earth
[10:04:26] <DunceCotus> its just moving the orbits to the Sun

[10:05:04] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: it is one of the cars I learned how to drive in, they let me drive it even when I was like 12 yo, in a priavte land of a golf course
[10:05:19] <DunceCotus> Aurora_v_kosmose: well that's kinda what I'm doing but I'm saying that talking about "outside" Earth is nonsensical as even the stellar dome is part of Earth

[10:10:22] <ButterNoodle> DunceCotus: I dont have a brother
[10:10:41] <DunceCotus> given how most of our reality seems fractal, I assume the Earth is also part of a bigger fractal structure
[10:10:43] <ButterNoodle> I think JesseDesu was going to the BMV looking for some yaoi a while back iirc
[10:10:44] <DunceCotus> hence bubbles
[10:11:09] <ButterNoodle> but bubbles have curves.. fractals have fractals
[10:11:19] <DunceCotus> Galaxies etc. are perhaps plasmic fractals within the cell wall of the Earth
[10:11:33] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: fractals can produce bubbles
[10:12:08] *** Quits: treeman6 (~treeman5@user/treeman5) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[10:12:29] <DunceCotus> the cell wall seems to absorb light, so our telescopes are really more like microscopes into the cell wall
[10:12:56] <DunceCotus> so 'galaxies' are likely tiny vortices
[10:13:30] <DunceCotus> outside the bubble(s) is perhaps a seething plasmic medium, which reacts with the cell wall to produce things we know of as "stars", "planets", "galaxies" and their motions

[10:15:06] <DunceCotus> "However, spheres do not pack together very nicely.  There’s always gaps between the adjacent spheres.  So when a foam forms, there may be some number of large bubbles, interspersed with smaller bubbles in the gaps, which in turn have even smaller bubbles in their gaps and so on.  The foam is approximately self-similar on smaller and smaller scales; in other words, foam is fractal."

[12:02:21] <MootPoot> There is like 2 of them which involve that

[12:02:56] *** Joins: topaer (~topaer__@121.72.139.44)
[12:02:58] <Bco1981> that's not why she... "graduated"
[12:03:01] <Bco1981> she was fired
[12:03:16] <MootPoot> For leaking company info 
[12:03:22] <Bco1981> the otaku community lost their shit yes. but she did a bad.
[12:03:41] <hi117> and what information did she leak to who and for what reason?
[12:03:59] <hi117> she leaked information to a guy because she was under attack from the fandom for having his DM show up on her stream
[12:04:22] <MootPoot> Yes... But she wasn't fired for talking to that dude 
[12:04:33] <MootPoot> The company stood behind her for that 
[12:04:37] <MootPoot> Until the leaking 
[12:04:41] <hi117> The scandal was still about broken hymens
[12:04:52] *** Quits: topaer__ (~topaer__@121.72.139.44) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[12:04:58] * MootPoot shrugs 
[12:04:59] <MootPoot> Sure 
[12:05:24] <Bco1981> for the greasy otaku, yes it's a scandal... but lets be serious... ofcourse she can have a boyfriend irl
[12:05:37] <Bco1981> who the F cares
[12:05:46] <MootPoot> A scandal these days is like 20 people on Twitter 
[12:05:47] <hi117> The Japanese community, I should have probably clarified that I meant on the Japanese side
[12:05:51] <MootPoot> 99% of the time 
[12:05:54] <Bco1981> besides the bad side of otaku culture
[12:06:17] <hi117> it's been pretty consistent that the Westerner fans don't really care but for the Japanese fans it's pretty much everything
[12:06:34] <MootPoot> Nah
[12:06:45] <MootPoot> If that was the case she would have no Japanese fans left 
[12:06:52] <MootPoot> Which is not the case 
[12:07:08] <hi117> MootPoot: this isn't all Japanese fans, but there is some part of the fan base that is willing to go to absolute extremes and have no repercussions
[12:07:33] <MootPoot> Sure.. But there is a big difference between "pretty much everything" and what you just described above 
[12:07:54] <hi117> but these fans are the driving force behind all of these scandals, it only takes a minority to drive the scandal
[12:08:56] <MootPoot> And? Like I said...most scandals are just 20 people on twitter
[12:09:08] <MootPoot> Twitter gonna twitter
[12:09:42] <hi117> until they start calling up the people in real life when they didn't even publish their phone number
[12:10:12] <MootPoot> When that happens they'll take the appropriate steps then...i really don't know what your overall point is 
[12:10:23] <hi117> yeah, they appropriate step is to go into hiding
[12:10:34] <MootPoot> Aside from making jp fans seem like they are all deranged people 
[12:11:04] <hi117> because they really can be, have you not noticed that Japanese animators are scared shitless to have a real sexually active relationship in anime?
[12:11:30] <amigojapan> hi117: I tried messaging you on element, but it seems you may not have noticed
[12:11:42] <hi117> it wasn't until very recently that main characters and anime having sex were a real thing
[12:11:48] <MootPoot> Becuase they can't air sex on tv... 
[12:12:00] <MootPoot> And most of the target market for anime is teens 
[12:12:09] <hi117> amigojapan: ah, it did not notify me
[12:13:14] <amigojapan> thats ok hi117
[12:14:01] <hi117> MootPoot: that isn't true for seinen anime, and they have sexually active people in live-action stuff all the time, even if it's not explicitly shown. only an anime do they have to tread the lines so carefully with making sure that the hymen stays intact
[12:14:03] <amigojapan> MootPoot: unless it is seinen
[12:14:19] <amigojapan> MootPoot: seinen broadcast after midnight anyway

[12:17:46] <hi117> what I'm complaining about is that they go all the way up to the point where it should have happened and then something convenient happens to stop it, and the only reason why that happens is so that fans don't get pissed off

[14:11:48] <senti> wait, I have no god, except the god of alcohol, whoever that is (they do good alchy with that sippin' cream, maybe I should find their number)
[14:12:23] <senti> JesseDesu, I think the mind isn't meant for lengthy wakefulness, regardless of sleep
[14:12:31] <amigojapan> senti: the god of alchohol is the porcelain god, yu have an icon of that god in your bathroom, which you pray to when you puke

[14:15:33] <senti> water and laying down, that does the job.
[14:15:49] <senti> sick stirring up? water up.

[14:22:06] <senti> it's not cost effective, as far as the alcohol content goes, but it's so damn tasty
[14:22:15] <amigojapan> it depends on the volume and percentage of alchohol of both the sipping cream and the beers
[14:22:37] <senti> it's like a chocolate malt, but better. And somehow, there's alcohol in it, if you really try to notice.
[14:23:10] <amigojapan> senti:you mean a malted?
[14:23:21] <senti> beer ain't on this level of flavour. this is just, try not to kill yourself by accident levels of tasty
[14:23:46] <senti> no, like a milkshake vs a chocolate malt

[14:24:11] <amigojapan> ok never  head of chocolate malt
[14:24:23] <senti> it's probably an american thing maybe?
[14:24:24] <amigojapan> I see

[14:24:52] <senti> I've had shakes and malts as a kid, and knew that shakes were easy to down, malts were really thick
[14:25:05] <senti> (obviously dessert drinks)
[14:25:23] <amigojapan> let me google to see if it is the same thing
[14:25:46] <senti> amigojapan: my mom made chocolate malts for us with a blender
[14:26:13] <senti> she used ice cream, hershey's chocolate, maybe some milk. put all that in a blender.
[14:26:21] <senti> it was really good
[14:26:33] <senti> I haven't had one of her malts in soooo many years.
[14:26:45] <senti> gods, my mom made the best malts
[14:26:58] <senti> maybe, I should ask her to make another.
[14:27:03] <amigojapan> senti: I suspected they were the same thing "Sometimes simply called a malt, a malted shake is one of those seriously old-timey drinks that is still found at diners and soda fountains. What distinguishes it is malted milk powder — the evaporated powder made from malted barley, wheat flour, and whole milk. It has a toasty, buttery flavor that's just a bit savory."
[14:27:41] <amigojapan> the real name is malted shake
[14:27:54] <senti> I'm no connoisseur, but that sounds so good.
[14:28:04] <amigojapan> a;0

[15:49:47] <Bco1981> can't remember the limits, if they told that back when sata became a thing,.
[15:51:38] <Bco1981> 32 bit operating systems and SATA 2 both had 2TB limits for a single drive.
[15:51:39] <Bco1981> O.S. limitation is lifted by release of 64bit and hardware limitation are lifted by release of SATA 3.

[17:52:39] <ezekielnoob> and take a beating
[17:52:43] <bxgelsan> ezekielnoob: do you stink?

[17:53:29] <ezekielnoob> GTA is kinda dead anyway
[17:53:35] <ezekielnoob> i just play it when i just want to roam around
[17:53:47] <bxgelsan> ezekielnoob: i cant play that if i wanted. i used to play it a bit
[17:53:48] <ezekielnoob> they still have beautiful scenery
[17:54:00] <bxgelsan> you had to get a mod menu just to fucking play the game normally
[17:54:08] <bxgelsan> and fend off malicious modders
[17:54:12] <bxgelsan> -.o
[17:54:30] <ezekielnoob> bxgelsan ah yeah it's fucked... i fortunately have found a few people to play with, and it made it exponentially more fun
[17:54:38] <ezekielnoob> so we do heists often together
[17:54:40] <bxgelsan> ezekielnoob: eventually it turns into a modder fight and its not even fun
[17:54:46] <bxgelsan> its just, shitty.
[17:54:47] <ezekielnoob> bxgelsan yeah the PC is just fucked
[17:54:53] <ezekielnoob> rockstar is just milking it
[17:54:59] <bxgelsan> yea
[17:55:00] <ezekielnoob> i feel like a cuck palying it, but it sitll is fun
[17:55:03] <ezekielnoob> lol
[17:55:05] <bxgelsan> oh its a great game
[17:55:11] <bxgelsan> but its the community
[17:55:15] <ezekielnoob> oh yeah
[17:55:26] <bxgelsan> ive played with a decent group of people
[17:55:37] <bxgelsan> we used to run cheat missions to help level up noobs :p
[17:55:39] <ezekielnoob> so many pieces of shit, but i believe ROckstar incentized shitty behavior too
[17:55:55] <ezekielnoob> it's too... militarized
[17:56:08] <bxgelsan> youd kill the client at a certain point in i forget what mission. or halt internet access to it, i forget who had to be host
[17:56:16] <ezekielnoob> i miss the old days of Car chase fights
[17:56:16] <bxgelsan> but a high payout mission
[17:56:19] <bxgelsan> low time

[22:57:30] <mixfix41> so the dub actors arent very close to the original creators so theres a lack of communication therefore easy to skimp them
[22:57:46] <mixfix41> they need to recognize their worth
[22:59:01] <mixfix41> 40k royalty for big box hits dub pay
[23:01:43] <emmeka> really, dub VAs have a rather daunting task. they have to do voice acting for something where the lip flaps are totally arbitrary and weren't designed for them at all.
[23:02:05] <emmeka> because people find it grating when audio/lip flaps don't sync
[23:03:26] <emmeka> it's a pretty difficult skill, and a lot of these people are dedicated specifically to that craft, and broadly a lot of them (especially from union dubs...) do pretty great at it nowadays. but these people make a few hundred bucks a show... before tax... as contractors.

[23:55:24] <Nanobot> Poeticode: An OTE long zone is when it's down 61.8% - 78.6% of a recent major upward movement. That is, when the price is relatively low compared to where it's been recently. The OTE long zone of the June 2021 - September 2021 movement is $37246 - $44033. If you expect the price to rise from there, that's the range to buy. Honestly, I was 50/50 on whether it was going to rise or lower from there, and I'm still not convinced it'll make a new all-time high
