[17:06:38] <hemish> btw how well is the autocomplete in python, speed and relevance wise?
[17:06:45] <hemish> i think it uses jedi for that

[17:19:01] <ArnavGhosh[m]> But i cant
[17:19:08] <hemish> cant pm through irc into telegram
[17:19:16] <Amit[m]> <ArnavGhosh[m]> "I know, but I think it was sort..." <- I Don't Think It's Comedic. I Saw Lot of Programmers Who Love VS Code but Fun Fact Is They Use Windows Also
[17:19:16] <ArnavGhosh[m]> Hes in Matrix world
[17:19:18] <ArnavGhosh[m]> And i am using Telegran
[17:19:57] <ArnavGhosh[m]> Okay, Use the same number to PM me on Whatsapp
[17:20:21] <hemish> a genuine question: when i try to pm through irc to telegram users, it shows "login before inviting telegram puppets". How can i do that?
[17:20:25] <ArnavGhosh[m]> btw, how was the navbar i made using the Tailwind?
[17:20:38] <AryaBackup[m]> hemish: its not possdible
[17:20:42] <Amit[m]> BTW, What is VS Codium??
[17:20:46] <AryaBackup[m]> maybe it is if you self-hosted a bridge
[17:20:57] <AryaBackup[m]> Amit[m]: vscode without blobs
[17:20:59] <AryaBackup[m]> and telemetry
[17:21:00] <ArnavGhosh[m]> Amit[m]: Open source veraion of VS code
[17:21:17] <NeoVoid[m]> Join the matrix leave telegram thats what we here for to embrace the FOSS.
[17:21:17] <NeoVoid[m]> not for getting addicted to telegram for the sake of ones comfort.
[17:21:17] <NeoVoid[m]> this group is a just medium for telegrams user to call onto FOSS platforms like matrix.
[17:21:27] <AryaBackup[m]> and yet you tell that in telegram
[17:21:28] <Amit[m]> ArnavGhosh[m]: VS Code also Open Source
[17:21:30] <Vaibhav[m]> Amit[m]: Open source version of Microsoft vs code
[17:21:46] <ArnavGhosh[m]> Amit[m]: Its not, VS code is Forked from VS codium
[17:22:01] <ArnavGhosh[m]> Which means Some features are missing in codium
[17:22:02] <NeoVoid[m]> AryaBackup[m]: yes as stated in last line its a medium
[17:22:15] <hemish> microsoft maintains code repository, but when making end user binaries, it adds some telemetry to that opensource stuff
[17:22:18] <ArnavGhosh[m]> Just like: Google Chrome and Chromium
[17:22:24] <Amit[m]> Let's See GitHub
[17:22:32] <Vaibhav[m]> > <Neo Void> Join the matrix leave telegram thats what we here for to embrace the FOSS.

[17:22:32] <Vaibhav[m]> I just joined back, time to leave maybe :/
[17:22:33] <ArnavGhosh[m]> hemish: Yeah
[17:22:53] <ArnavGhosh[m]> Vaibhav[m]: Why?
[17:23:07] <hemish> matlab open source hai vscode, but vo waala nahi jo end user vs code ki site se download karte hain
[17:23:21] <NeoVoid[m]> ok i am gonna go. but i have unleashed the mad titan ramram. dont let him snap his fingers.
[17:23:27] <hemish> aur jo open source hai, uska naam "code -oss" rakha hai
[17:23:27] <ArnavGhosh[m]> hemish: Haa
[17:23:42] <NeoVoid[m]> s/ramram/@aramharam /
[17:23:43] <ArnavGhosh[m]> NeoVoid[m]: Does he also have Deviant Syndrome?
[17:23:44] <hemish> uske upar telemetry and other stuff daal ke microsoft jo use bana deta hai, that is "vs code"
[17:23:44] <Amit[m]> Whole VS Code made from JS and VS Codium is Using Shell.
[17:23:49] <Amit[m]> Isn't that Weird?
[17:24:32] <ArnavGhosh[m]> Amit[m]: Yeh
[17:24:33] <ArnavGhosh[m]> Amit[m]: No
[17:24:39] <hemish> it contains shell scripts to create opensource binaries of code oss
[17:25:05] <hemish> the shell scripts would probably download the source code of "code" first, apply some patches and then build it
[17:25:08] <Amit[m]> hemish: VS Codium >> https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium
[17:25:21] <hemish> amit: haa main dekh chuka
[17:25:23] <Amit[m]> hemish: VS Code >> https://github.com/microsoft/vscode
[17:25:43] <Amit[m]> Kuchh to Gadbad Hain
[17:25:51] <hemish> koi gadbad nahi hai
[17:26:08] <Amit[m]> "ium" It's Mostly Used by Google.
[17:26:14] <hemish> vscodium ke src folder mein source hai nhi to js kyon dikhayega
[17:26:21] <Amit[m]> that's the reason to think that
[17:26:41] <hemish> src folder mein microsoft waali vscode repo se source download hoga
[17:26:46] <hemish> shell scripts se
[17:26:55] <hemish> vscodium ki repo mein build instructions hain
[17:27:01] <Amit[m]> hemish: VS Code ka Source me to hain. Main to wohi baat kar raha hoon.

[17:34:19] <Amit[m]> So, Microsoft Using Google Tactic In Different Way. First Build Chromium and Then Chrome.
[17:34:33] <hemish> vscodium microsoft ka project nhi hai
[17:34:38] <Amit[m]> ArnavGhosh[m]: Average.
[17:34:39] <hemish> microsoft ne 'ium' nhi lagaya
[17:34:50] <hemish> microsoft ne to rep bhi "vscode" naam se hi banayi hai
[17:34:53] <hemish> *repo
[17:35:10] <hemish> 'ium' apni foss community ne hi banaya hai
[17:35:48] <hemish> but you can say that tactic, they first build vscode repo, and finally add things to make original vscode binaries from ms
[17:36:30] <hemish> quit

[19:24:00] <relejek[m]> i can't help you with the 'decompiling' yet what i have seen people do is with C/C++ is coz that code is close to machine code / binaries thus some people find it easy to reverse engineer the core logic.
[19:24:49] <relejek[m]> whereas android code is high level code much more convoluted to be reverse engineered from MC

[19:26:04] <relejek[m]> it may be much easier to replicate the app by yourself by learning the USER features and discern the core code under the hood.

[20:13:20] <hemish> there is a website just search for apk decompiler, it actually decompiles, i used it to extract algorithm used for generating captcha from our school's app, so that i could a write a python client for my school app's server
[20:13:32] <hemish> there is an android app for same purpose, but it is slower

[20:21:29] <hemish> a fun thing just happened with me, i had pure arch (by classical way) with sway installed on a partition, but i wanted to try archlinuxgui cinnamon edition. Most of beginner distros install grub by default, and archlinuxgui installed that too, so i always remove grub is i use refind, to pass kernel parameters in refind we need a configuration file called 'refind_linux.conf' present inside /boot. So what i did was mounted the previous arch install
[20:21:31] <hemish> to /mnt
[20:21:57] <hemish> and then ran 'sudo cp /mnt/boot/refind_linux.conf /boot/'
[20:22:48] <hemish> but i forgot that that configuration had 'root=theuuidofpreviouspartition'. i rebooted my machine and went to boot archlinuxgui
[20:22:57] <hemish> and boom, my previous arch install booted
[20:23:31] <hemish> so the fun thing is that the kernel that was booted was of archlinuxgui, but its root was the previous archinstall
[20:23:53] <hemish> so, technically, you can boot an ubuntu parition with arch kernel too
[20:24:38] <hemish> later i corrected with correct partition in 'root=<>'
