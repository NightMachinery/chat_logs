[15:52:13] <dcpurton> morning to you flatcap 
[15:53:41] <dcpurton> what defines which properties of a message are given object status for colour?
[15:53:45] <dcpurton> https://neomutt.org/feature/index-color#3-%C2%A0colors
[15:54:16] <dcpurton> Just things you might want to colour separately?
[15:55:00] <flatcap> hi dcpurton 
[15:56:11] <flatcap> yes
[15:56:42] <flatcap> in the index, that's been done by columns...
[15:57:01] <flatcap> in the status bar, you just have to be really good with regexes
[15:58:10] <dcpurton> But with $index_format you can essentially define whatever columns you want, right?
[15:58:47] <dcpurton> it looks like the default columns are (more or less) the ones picked as objects
[15:59:05] <flatcap> yes, but the colours are wrapped around the expandos
[15:59:26] <flatcap> so it works whatever the arrangement
[16:00:25] <flatcap> the index colours patch is an old one.  it could probably be done better now
[16:01:50] <flatcap> have a look at each member of Body and think if a user could ever conceivably want to display it and/or colour it
[16:02:17] <dcpurton> I guess I'm more wondering why you can colour index_label (%y, %Y)
[16:02:35] <dcpurton> But neither %Y or %y appears in the default $index_format
[16:04:28] <flatcap> I guess it was thought to be useful, but not enough people use labels to put it in the default format
[16:05:30] <flatcap> btw, I've thought of a problem with the "everything separate until send" model for compose...
[16:06:03] <flatcap> if the user calls <write-fcc>, then the Bodys would need to be assembled
[16:06:23] <flatcap> but if the user then quits compose, we'd have to be careful about who frees what
[16:08:18] <flatcap> (separate implies AttachPtr owns the Body, joined-up implies the Bodys own their children)

[17:08:12] <dcpurton> %Q: "Q", if MIME part qualifies for attachment counting
[17:08:19] <dcpurton> What does this mean?
[17:13:05] <flatcap> in the index, there's a %X which count the number of attachments...
[17:13:23] <flatcap> but some "attachments" are more meaningful than others
[17:13:38] <flatcap> so you can create rules about which should be counted
[17:13:47] * flatcap looks up the docs...

[17:18:14] <dcpurton> there you go…

[18:36:27] <zsw> flatcap: sorry for the lag.  Here's the rss feed -- https://www.reddit.com/r/altcomix/comments/.rss  An example of a subject would be '/u/Log_Log_Log on Seattle Star, Oct. 1985'.  I could try and parse off the "$username on " before rss2email sends the message.
[18:38:24] <zsw> My other idea was to figure out how mutt does its threading and have a script run (via incrond?) to setup the threading.  Since I'm shrouded in ignorance, I figured I better ask before going too far down these rabbit holes.

[19:12:19] <kaji> I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask this, but can someone give me an opinion on what's the best custom email domain name to have as an open source developer?
[19:12:49] <kaji> lastname.com is sadly not there, I wonder if lastname.is works? Like firstname@lastname.is, or should I just first@firstlast.com
[19:12:54] <kaji> Which would be more common?
[19:18:27] <flatcap> zsw: no worries.   can you publish a set of emails (one thread, say) from rss2email so I can have look and a think -- github gist or pastebin 
[19:18:54] <flatcap> kaji: .io and .dev seem fairly popular (no idea what they cost, though)
[19:19:29] <kaji> flatcap: sadly lastname.io and lastname.dev were also taken :(
[19:19:37] <flatcap> :-(
[19:19:43] <kaji> Should I just give up and use firstlast.com?
[19:20:01] <flatcap> perhaps, if your names aren't too long
[19:20:27] <kaji> Yeah it's like 10 characters :)
[19:20:43] <flatcap> that's not too bad :-)
[19:20:48] <kaji> Which is probably why all domains for last.tld is taken lol
