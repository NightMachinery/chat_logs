[18:51:43] <forgotmynick> Hello. I have a script that polls for temperature every second. I'm trying to find a way to setup an alert if the temperature has deviated more than 2c in the last 5 minutes however I'm not sure how to approach this. Say at 00:00:00 the temp is 5c, at 00:01:00 the temp is 8c, at 00:02:00 the temp is 2c and at 00:05:00 the temp is 5.2c. Comparing against the first entry or taking an average wouldn't be reliable. Can anyone offer
[18:51:43] <forgotmynick> some advice? I don't need to know how to code it, more so the methodology
[18:53:31] <forgotmynick> I suppose I could do this with max() as an example but what about a way to detect a sustained temperature change for 5 or 10 seconds?
[18:58:06] <TinoDidriksen> Can compare rolling averages.
[19:01:26] <TinoDidriksen> You need a bit of everything. A baseline, plus both min and max to see if the extremes deviate from the given baseline, plus rolling averages to see if the temperature is skewing.
[19:10:48] <Naktibalda> why does temperature change so quickly?
[19:10:59] <biberu> because of all the bitcoin miners
[19:12:28] <Naktibalda> is it fine if temperature goes up 24 degrees in 60 minutes?
[19:18:15] *** Joins: magla (~gelignite@55d4d852.access.ecotel.net)
[19:25:37] <forgotmynick> Thank you! Rolling averages is exactly where I need to start. It's for a combination of things but ultimately to protect a data cabinet as I want to put in several ups to keep the network and servers running (I have health anxiety and extreme paranoia about things catching fire). If the temperature is increasing then I can increase air conditioning automatically but don't want to for short bursts as electricity is quite expensive
[19:25:37] <forgotmynick> in the UK. If the temperature gets too high then I can build some kind of fire suppression system too (I'll need to learn this but have plenty of sbc's to make a project out of it). I can't afford to buy suppression system and the cabinet is close to gas pipes. I'm looking into moving the gas but until then I can at least learn this even if it's just for fun. Commercial electricians said it's fine and has no hazard but people
[19:25:37] <forgotmynick> online (mainly from the US) said it is. The electricians said our laws are far more stricter than the US and shouldn't worry about it but it's too late lol

[21:20:24] <__adrian> so, what does that record represent?
[21:20:32] <__adrian> reads to me like a line item on an order
[21:20:49] <__adrian> ?
[21:21:34] <Northwoods> and individual order number ( not items )
[21:21:44] <__adrian> so a whole order?
[21:21:49] <Northwoods> right
[21:23:26] <__adrian> so does  Ord_model  represent an Order (a thing in your code)? or does it represent a _row_ in that table (a thing in your database)?
[21:24:51] <__adrian> a good way to determine this might be, "does it have any business logic (how do i handle orders)?" or is it full of database logic ("how do i INSERT things in the DB")?
[21:25:05] <Northwoods> full of database logic
[21:25:21] <Northwoods> i am using different tables ( more generic ) functions
[21:25:30] <__adrian> more generic = more bad
[21:25:36] <Northwoods> ok
[21:25:44] <Northwoods> Thanks for help, i got a call , need to leave
[21:25:49] <__adrian> ok

[23:03:05] <__adrian> use https://php.net/class.datetime instead. recommend starting with just "august", and if it's in the future, adjust to the previous year.
[23:03:16] <__adrian> e.g., https://3v4l.org/tCA0Q
[23:09:05] <AllenJB> Don't forget to consider the case where it's currently August
[23:11:05] <__adrian> if it were, then $aug > $now would be false (they would, at worst, be equal). take january as an example: https://3v4l.org/Sbc4o
[23:23:06] <maneken> whouldn't new DateTime($any_month) always be in the future?
[23:23:46] <__adrian> no (see above)
[23:25:18] <__adrian> but also i think "this year" is implied
[23:25:31] <__adrian> you could write that just to be sure
[23:28:19] <maneken> I see. How about this: https://3v4l.org/vFFnh
[23:30:00] <__adrian> that gives you a different (and incorrect, if i understood the question) result
[23:31:37] <__adrian> (should be >, not >=)
[23:32:07] <__adrian> (but still not how i understood the question; i read it as compared to "now")
[23:32:36] <__adrian> actually i see how your interpretation might also be right
[23:32:57] <__adrian> so i guess it depends on what you mean  :)
[23:34:14] <maneken> I'm taking a month name from the user (eg: 'January', 'August') and I want to end up with a 'Y-m-d' string of the last such month.
[23:35:20] <maneken> so if it's january now, and the user says 'January', I'm looking for '2021-01-01'
[23:36:26] <__adrian> k. so yep
[23:37:38] <maneken> thank you!
