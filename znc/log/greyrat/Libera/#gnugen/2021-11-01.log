[09:45:44] <sunyibo> I have a debian vm that goes into paused mode shortly after booting up. I tried the usual "prevent sleep" https://askubuntu.com/questions/47311/how-do-i-disable-my-system-from-going-to-sleep
[09:45:51] <sunyibo> Any thoughts?

[11:41:06] <artectrex[m]> Love this idea
[11:51:47] <artectrex[m]> Does anyone here want to do this with me? I think I have about 200GB of stuff
[11:59:58] <sunyibo> as I mentionned, my disk is full ... ;-)
[12:00:44] <sunyibo> Has anyone looked at religions as forks? something like 'git diff christianism judaism' (pardon my git)

[14:45:04] <Notkea> pondering switching to ZFS's encryption for that reason in particular... But my hardware is so old that it doesn't have AES-NI, so it's a pain... Time to renew the hardware I suppose :c
