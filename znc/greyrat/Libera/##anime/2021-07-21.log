[00:27:29] <spoonm> so one thing that's been going through my mind is that my employer should technically know about me using IRC under this nickname, particularly here on libera, and I wonder if any colleagues, supervisors and whatnot would care about me asking a little too much about Bco1981's children
[00:27:42] <druggedlady> anyway, I had a terrifying moment just now when the party kids in the garden were playing a macarena remix at full blast

[01:14:49] <MootPoot> I want cute swedish girls to like me
[01:15:02] <davic> and in University you get 500 usd in benefits for free as long as you finish the courses
[01:15:10] <spoonm> "free"
[01:15:27] <spoonm> stop salivating, MootPoot, you know it's all coming from taxes
[01:15:29] <davic> and can loan 1000 usd extra with an interest of 0.05 % from the gov.
[01:15:33] <davic> spoonm: ye
[01:15:37] <MootPoot> spoonm:  I dont really mind though
[01:15:44] <spoonm> what?! how can you not mind?!
[01:15:50] <davic> spoonm: he should just do it like me, take all the benefits and when you earn enough flee
[01:16:06] <MootPoot> because I'm not a temporary embarassed millionare

[01:16:27] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: Quote by Ronald Wright: ‚ÄúJohn Steinbeck once ... - Goodreads <https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/328134-john-steinbeck-once-said-that-socialism-never-took-root-in> | Temporarily Embarrassed Millionaires <http://www.temporarilyembarrassedmillionaires.org/> | The Myth of the Temporarily Embarrassed Millionaire - Jacobin <https://jacobinmag.com/2018/05/americans-class-politics-piston>
[01:17:05] <davic> MootPoot: but tbh, the taxes are fucking high, and it only gives you benefits when you are young and for your kids and if you get fired
[01:17:12] <davic> and if you get sick
[01:17:14] <davic> but thats about it
[01:17:23] <MootPoot> its a nice compromise over here tbh
[01:17:25] <Bco1981> swedes... complaining about high taxes... pfft
[01:17:32] <MootPoot> our taxes are about the same as in the US
[01:17:37] <MootPoot> but we get more for it
[01:17:47] <davic> Bco1981: its a socialist communist state according to americans so
[01:18:13] <spoonm> I understand more or less what you mean, MootPoot, but I don't see how wanting less taxation is suddenly a bad thing
[01:18:57] <MootPoot> because "less taxation" means in practice "less taxation for those who are already loaded af, and the rest of us have the same tax"
[01:19:07] <spoonm> in my country we don't have only income tax: we have two other main fees we are legally bound to pay when we're working, namely social security and the guaranteed fund for time spent under employment
[01:19:20] *** Joins: Enyo (~Enyo@cpe-24-59-253-105.twcny.res.rr.com)
[01:20:10] <spoonm> part of your salary goes to the government for income tax, then another part goes to the government for your future cents-worth pension, then another part goes to the government so they can give it to you if you get fired (as long as you meet some requirements)
[01:20:10] <MootPoot> if you look at tax cuts here in NA at least, they get them passed while flag-bearning the moniker of normal working class people, but then you look at the requiremets for that tax cut and who it benefits, its already super well off people
[01:20:29] <davic> spoonm: we have income tax, employer tax, church tax and then tax on the products you buy of 25%
[01:20:39] <MootPoot> I have 5% sales tax here
[01:20:41] <MootPoot> and income tax
[01:20:42] <MootPoot> thats it
[01:20:48] <spoonm> davic: around 60% tax on the products here, 97% if they're imported
[01:20:57] <davic> spoonm: not enough
[01:21:02] <davic> just tax it 100%
[01:21:11] <spoonm> it essentially becomes that
[01:21:28] <spoonm> tax on goods affects the poor more so than it affects the rich, MootPoot 
[01:21:30] <MootPoot> spoonm:  but anyway, for the most part in all the examples relavant to me , less tax actually hurts me 
[01:21:58] <davic> spoonm: before you can import shit without being taxed, but then they started just taxing everything from the first cent, with a 15 usd fee
[01:22:15] <MootPoot> but most of the bills arent for simple goods tax, they're for like tax on investment income over like 500k and shit like that
[01:22:42] <davic> spoonm: how is it with the covid19 in br
[01:22:46] <spoonm> awful
[01:23:22] <davic> spoonm: still going full trump?
[01:23:37] <spoonm> no, Trump at least acknowledged it and everything at one point
[01:23:48] <davic> not really in a way
[01:23:51] <MootPoot> without tax I would be stuck paying my student loans untill my 30s, my parents would probably not have lived to this date with the healthcare it offers, and I would not be able to attend like basic schooling for free when me and my family were poorer two decades ago
[01:24:14] <davic> MootPoot: I have 13000 in student loans
[01:24:27] <davic> payin around 180 usd every 3 months
[01:24:31] <MootPoot> tax has helped me immensely, and I'm not trading that for some far fetched dream of not being able to make a million dallars a year instead of only 800j
[01:24:33] <MootPoot> 800k
[01:24:57] <davic> most swedes that move abroad just stops paying it
[01:25:11] <MootPoot> I would be perfectly okay with a 100% tax on all incomes and investment incomes after you cross 100k in income t bh
[01:25:17] <davic> and then the swedish student loan gov. body just hires some detective to find the guy and provide them with a letter
[01:25:35] <spoonm> I'm not going to say that taxes bring absolutely no benefit to those who make use of aid stemming from it, MootPoot, but you're making the mistake of assuming all these need to come from the government, and that the government would've had no way of stepping in to help the poor despite lower taxes
[01:26:05] <davic> MootPoot: I think the main issue of USA is
[01:26:07] <davic> the states
[01:26:09] <MootPoot> no, but it would hnot have been as good
[01:26:12] <MootPoot> as I had it
[01:26:13] <davic> what the fuck is wrong with the states
[01:26:21] <spoonm> you don't know that, MootPoot 
[01:26:27] <ButterNoodle> they all need to secede davic 
[01:26:29] <davic> Like travel from NY to Texas and the laws are fucking completely different
[01:26:34] <ButterNoodle> then we can be like europe
[01:26:37] <davic> ButterNoodle: just vassalize them
[01:26:38] <MootPoot> I know it, just look at the US lol
[01:26:41] <davic> gosh
[01:26:58] <MootPoot> if we were like europe we wouldnt have fat girls here
[01:27:04] <MootPoot> everyone would be in shape
[01:27:05] <ButterNoodle> wut
[01:27:07] <davic> wut
[01:27:10] <MootPoot> lol
[01:27:12] <davic> just look at UK
[01:27:16] <Bco1981> eh... no
[01:27:20] <MootPoot> it was a joke
[01:27:20] <ButterNoodle> you think there are no fat girls in Europe...
[01:27:21] <ButterNoodle> lol
[01:27:31] <davic> Bco1981: well DK girls just loves the polse
[01:27:35] <davic> cant save that
[01:27:35] <spoonm> there are a few things our government provides the poor if they want to go to university (and cannot enter any of the hundreds of great public, entirely free universities): prouni, fies and the requirement that 50% of seats be occupied by people who come from public schools
[01:27:37] <MootPoot> but afaik the obesity rate in euro is really low
[01:27:54] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: you can move the bar
[01:27:55] <spoonm> prouni is something I agree with: the government will pay your tuition for as long as you don't flunk over 2 classes in a year
[01:28:00] <MootPoot> mainly due to the focus on public transit and dense cities
[01:28:03] <davic> MootPoot: its because we dont put sugar in everything and the taxes are so high so you are more picky with your cash
[01:28:04] <MootPoot> walkable cities
[01:28:07] <davic> like
[01:28:10] <spoonm> fies is a student loan and it was used for fraud
[01:28:21] <davic> my gf told me that filipinos put sugar in their fucking pasta
[01:28:23] <davic> I was like wut
[01:28:45] <davic> apparently US fucked over PH when they owned them and put sugar in everything
[01:31:27] <MootPoot> but anyway, given examples of more captilistic countries I honestly think despite government wastage this is the best compromise
[01:31:36] <MootPoot> I'd stick on the side of more govt and tax rather then less
[01:31:55] <MootPoot> only way I would change my mind is if I was a trust fund kid
[01:32:30] <MootPoot> but if you're low, middle, and even upper middle class, tax helps you more then it hurts ( provided your govt is not completely corrupt/incompetent )
[01:35:29] <MootPoot> I'm probably never going to ever make it big enough to actually be benefited from tax cuts..even if I hit it semi big like Nanobot  I would have no issue coughing up the tax for it

[03:29:01] <mixfix41> you couldnt ever talk me into a chair that helps relieve lack of activity
[03:29:25] <mixfix41> you cant just sit on soft cushion and expect it to be i dont know it better be silk and mink or whatever
[03:30:09] <MootPoot> I mean, sure
[03:30:28] <MootPoot> sounds like your priorities are too different to ever be part of the intended market
[03:30:36] <MootPoot> in which case, go get your scooter
[03:30:46] <mixfix41> well im just saying

[03:30:54] <mixfix41> you could build projects or whatever
[03:31:10] <MootPoot> with what money?
[03:31:27] <MootPoot> the entire point of a nice chair is to make the work you have to do easier on you
[03:31:27] <mixfix41> idk im just saying my brain cells go on strike about that chair for some reason
[03:31:40] <mixfix41> let me look at it
[03:31:48] <MootPoot> unless you're going to abandon a desk job and go work in the fields
[03:34:02] <mixfix41> just get a low back chair you dont need those high backs
[03:34:52] <mixfix41> a chair is a heavy sturdy piece you dont want it too big 
[03:35:25] <mixfix41> your actually just getting a chair for the price of a new mattress tho
[03:35:33] <MootPoot> so?
[03:35:46] <mixfix41> isnt it just pillows and cushioning how does it get over 150>
[03:36:42] <mixfix41> i know sitting down a body pillow fixes everything for your arms to rest on
[03:36:50] <mixfix41> just get a cheap body pillow and call it a day
[03:37:03] <mixfix41> the firm cucumber one
[03:37:04] <MootPoot> what do you work as?
[03:37:21] <mixfix41> no job at the moment
[03:37:28] <MootPoot> profession?
[03:38:00] <mixfix41> just technology enthusiast i have interest in a variety of crafts
[03:38:11] <mixfix41> not sure how to make m oney from yet
[03:38:13] <Jigsy> Work from home.
[03:38:19] <Jigsy> Become a prostitute. It's easy.
[03:38:34] <MootPoot> so you havent had a proper job yet?
[03:38:55] <mixfix41> couldnt say so
[03:39:02] <Jigsy> I've never worked either.
[03:39:15] <MootPoot> yeah I can see why your take on the chair is like that
[03:39:20] <MootPoot> lol
[03:39:27] <mixfix41> why
[03:39:38] <MootPoot> spend a few years working a desk job and you'll get it
[03:39:38] <mixfix41> but im reading kernel device driver pdf why am i not at the screen a lot???

[03:41:21] <mixfix41> i have a point tho 
[03:41:25] <mixfix41> buy good shit!
[03:41:39] <mixfix41> but if you have the cash
[03:41:43] <mixfix41> and the stuff already
[03:41:50] <mixfix41> a nice chair i could be wrong then
[03:41:59] <mixfix41> you speak for minority imo
[03:42:08] <mixfix41> or i gues the majority i dont know
[03:43:14] <mixfix41> its not a big argument but it is kinda a lot of cash for a chair
[03:44:38] <mixfix41> i know one of the kernel head project developers he skates if you didnt have skating equipment then a nice chair is a mistake also
[03:48:17] <mixfix41> MootPoot: show me someone you think makesuseof that chair in a short clip 
[03:48:32] <mixfix41> that you think proves my point wrong
[03:51:27] <mixfix41> MootPoot: if you buy those wooden chair cushionings for extra padding it helps as much as an expensive chair 
[03:51:46] <mixfix41> same with layers of cushioning on a bed
[03:52:08] <mixfix41> im not sure how people sleep on wooden beds but theres  a thresholds for beds i find

[04:19:29] <mixfix41> obviously for looks its good to have nice things including chairs 
[04:20:04] <mixfix41> but functionality wise if you are just needing a chair that performs then extra butt cushion and lap pillow is sufficient
[04:20:48] <mixfix41> in hindsight for room design and professional look expensive is better
[04:22:28] <dfch> Japan nukes were bad, but totally deserved it
[04:22:49] <dfch> (not troll)

[05:23:49] <MootPoot> but they also got me this, but this is for me only

[05:24:10] <snake> beaky, oh i dont know the difference xD
[05:24:31] <snake> MootPoot, why wouldnt they just say "hey keep the macbook"
[05:24:39] <snake> instead of returning it and then buying it again
[05:24:43] <MootPoot> cuz the costco one was more expensive
[05:24:46] <snake> o
[05:24:51] <MootPoot> its the same model

[05:25:09] <snake> technically not wrong, he payed partially

[05:36:34] <MootPoot> the 50gb IDE
[05:37:44] <MootPoot> tbh now days I just use full IDEs over fancy editors like vscode
[05:37:50] <MootPoot> I'll use vscode for quick edits and stuff
[05:38:12] <MootPoot> but if I actually need to dev stuff I'll go use like PHPstorm or something jetbrains for web

[06:51:31] <snake> Aurora_v_kosmose, they want it to be obscure
[06:51:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: Yes and it's idiotic.
[06:52:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> As youtube-dl demonstrates, you just need one person to bother implementing an extractor and sharing it.
[06:52:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> What even is the point?
[06:52:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Rather than wasting time on useless obfuscation, rather spend those expensive programmer hours on useful things.
[06:54:10] <snake> Aurora_v_kosmose, if pixiv didnt make it obscure, the artists would go to a site that tries
[06:54:17] <snake> (maybe)
[06:54:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They're also idiots.
[06:54:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If your browser can show it, it's extractable from your cache or from the page's render info.
[06:54:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Literally ctrt-i -> media on firefox
[06:54:56] <snake> yes but if some group of idiots finds out what another group of idiots wants, they can offer it and sell it to them, even if it's all a facade
[06:55:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Furthermore, if no one can see your art what even is the point publishing it online?
[06:56:11] <amigojapan> You can record a video using quicktime, as a screencapture
[06:56:22] <amigojapan> Nothing can stop that
[06:56:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Yeah but that usually shits all over quality.
[06:57:09] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: I have found it to be ok for me
[06:58:07] <amigojapan> At least with quicktime on a Mac
[06:58:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hm, might be system dependent now that I think about it. I'm fairly sure screen resolution settings affect it.
[06:58:58] <amigojapan> Ah yeah that might affect it, yes
[06:59:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Like, recording 4k output on a 1080p desktop won't work.
[06:59:33] <amigojapan> Right
[06:59:44] <amigojapan> Agreed
[06:59:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Recording 240p on your toaster will probably work.

[09:42:54] <pteague> financially stable panic attacks? i don't necessarily get panic attacks, but i baton down the hatches & go into survival mode ... do i really need to spend that money? in the past i've gone down to focusing on paying rent (or finding someplace cheaper) & making sure i have just enough food

[09:48:38] <Matt|home> i can't go back to work yet. when i do my unemployment stops immediately (they won't defer reporting to the irs), and when that happens witholding my first two weeks check puts me in overdraft

[09:48:54] <Matt|home> so i have to wait until im at least at breaking even in my checking account..

[14:13:11] <amigojapan> darkpeach: I had tomako smell it, she said "it smells like disinfectant" :(

[14:14:37] <amigojapan> I see
[14:15:12] <amigojapan> Anyway it is pleasant on my nose
[14:17:58] <darkpeach> you should try the tesori one that smells like a pirate :D
[14:19:01] <amigojapan> darkpeach: I had tomako shell it again and she said "it's a fragrance, and it smells blue"
[14:19:38] <darkpeach> must be the aqua one then, not the citrus
[14:19:48] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[14:19:59] <JesseDesu> my correctly sized screen protector came in the mail
[14:20:05] <JesseDesu> i installed it
[14:20:12] <JesseDesu> so much better
[14:20:59] <amigojapan> Nice Jesse, I need a screen protector badly. I sanded down a player t if my phone's screen with too much use
[14:21:02] <darkpeach> When I smell this, I have the feeling of being a pirate coming freshly from a wellness vacation on some lost island, like 200 years ago.

[14:21:29] <JesseDesu> you sanded down a what

[16:23:41] <JesseDesu> do you even have one
[16:23:43] <OjousamaNoises> amigojapan: do you like collabs more, or do you like one girl alone?

[16:27:24] <amigojapan> Ok
[16:27:40] <OjousamaNoises> I have no problem with marine, I just feel like amigo is in a vulnerable place and hasn't seen really any of a lot of great vtubers
[16:27:44] <OjousamaNoises> I like marine
[16:28:42] <amigojapan> It is true that there are plenty of vtubers I have never seen

[18:03:20] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth what does society think of single person?
[18:04:41] <HubertFarnsworth> not good DunceCotus 
[18:04:55] <OjousamaNoises> It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife

[18:05:43] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth why don't you tell them that
[18:05:57] <ButterNoodle> yea what does society think of a man with 2 wives?
[18:06:06] <DunceCotus> no parent wants to torture their child (more than they have to)
[18:06:22] <ButterNoodle> idk why we are hung up on this... 0 is not enough but 2 is too many?

[18:38:09] <ButterNoodle> no
[18:38:09] <DunceCotus> saganman right, cause parents are meant to be responsible for their own kids
[18:38:17] <DunceCotus> locking both the parents and kids into family arrangements 
[18:38:21] <DunceCotus> that are only harmful for all
[18:39:07] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle so they're not your rays of sunshine?
[18:39:24] <ButterNoodle> that shit stops when they turn into teenagers
[18:39:29] <OjousamaNoises> and I suspect getting pushed into it against your will isn't going to help either
[18:39:50] <saganman> DunceCotus: yeah yeah, here kids are supposed to take care of their parents. There are laws on this.
[18:40:09] <OjousamaNoises> saganman: what happens if you emmigrate?
[18:40:13] <ButterNoodle> yea having kids with someone just to make them happy isnt good

[18:44:04] <saganman> I recently read a good German joke.
[18:44:35] <DunceCotus> its unclear if there are any good German jokes
[18:44:39] <saganman> the one where american couple adopt a german baby, anyone know this?
[18:44:50] <OjousamaNoises> I have not heard this, no
[18:45:26] <ButterNoodle> saganman: its a chinese baby
[18:49:36] <amigojapan> saganman: I think part of the problem is you are leading your parents to think you are willing to get married when you are not, and I think the solution is telling them you are not willing to get married
[18:50:06] <OjousamaNoises> Yeah, at a certain point you have to get by your mother's refusal to actually have a conversation like an adult

[18:50:15] <OjousamaNoises> either a letter, or through your father or whatever
[18:50:24] <saganman> So this American couple adopt a German baby boy. Everything is fine except he doesn't talk. They take him to doctor and get him examined and doctors says there is nothing wrong. One day they gave him apple strudle and the kid says, "this apple strudle is a bit tepid". The parents ask, "Wolfgang, you have never spoken before. After all these years now you finally speak. Why haven't you spoken before?" and the kid says, "Up until now everything has 
[18:50:24] <saganman> been satisfactory"
[18:50:33] <OjousamaNoises> or just telling her "it's frustrating that my mother handles arguments like a 5 year old"
[18:51:13] <OjousamaNoises> I went about a year without speaking to my mother at one point, but we get along much better now
[18:51:16] <DunceCotus> Wolfgang XD

[21:48:38] <Nanobot> I use rsnapshot for my main backups, and I also do special backups of my wallet to multiple devices.
[21:49:06] <ezekielnoob> bitcoin
[21:49:38] <ezekielnoob> i think you were mining them years ago
[21:49:42] <ezekielnoob> amiright Nanobot
[21:50:17] <Nanobot> I've never mined bitcoin. Bitcoin mining on commodity hardware has been unprofitable the entire time I've been involved in bitcoin.
[21:50:29] <Bco1981> if you have transfered some bitcoin and restore a backup... what happens to the duplicate that you "actually" don't have anymore ?
[21:50:38] <Nanobot> It's cheaper to just buy bitcoin.
[21:51:01] <ezekielnoob> oh i see.. i wonder who that guy i was thinking of
[21:51:20] <Nanobot> Bco1981: The wallet is just the keys. The blockchain is what records where all the bitcoins are. So, your old wallet has keys to addresses that now contain 0 bitcoins.
[21:51:29] <TadeusTaD> ^
[21:51:47] <Bco1981> ah okay
[21:53:05] <ezekielnoob> still deciding on my soundsystem, anyone of y ou guys have a 5.1 surround sound or a really nice stereo system?
[21:53:50] <Bco1981> ezekielnoob: a old coworker was very into home theater audio, and he said something to me that i could relate to.
[21:54:16] <ezekielnoob> what he said?
[21:54:43] <ezekielnoob> this is my current room setup... i have a projector https://flickr.com/photos/fernandezekiel/51312068430/in/dateposted/
[21:54:44] <ImoutoBot> [title] IMG_20210713_141223 | Ezekiel Fernandez | Flickr
[21:54:52] <Bco1981> when you watch a movie and it goes boom, then with a 5.1 system you will only get that boom from one direction. and he would hear that. and i must admit i hear that too. i notice it. and it is kinda annoying.
[21:54:57] <ezekielnoob> i want to add a better sound system, not that the curent one is bad
[21:55:29] <ezekielnoob> Bco1981 but it's supposed to be like that right?
[21:55:32] <Bco1981> no

[21:56:10] <SpiritOfSummer> bro how do you save quotes
[21:56:23] <ezekielnoob> ah i see... but maybe it's the movie recording itself that is bad?
[21:56:27] <ezekielnoob> Bco1981 ^
[21:56:44] <ezekielnoob> im leaning more towards stereo tho
[21:56:45] <ezekielnoob> cause anime
[21:56:50] <ezekielnoob> anime don't got 5.1 sounds
[21:57:21] <Bco1981> ezekielnoob: true it depends on the audio tracks in the movie. but if you have a atmos movie track, and only have 5.1 then you won't hear it as intended because you don't have the correct setup.
[21:57:48] <ezekielnoob> it has to be good on music to me tho too
[21:57:56] <Bco1981> anyway, that was just something to think about
[21:57:58] <ezekielnoob> so that's why i am more towards 2.1/2.0 than a 5.1
[21:58:01] <ezekielnoob> Bco1981 thanks!

[21:59:42] <ezekielnoob> speakers age well
[21:59:54] <ezekielnoob> especially passive ones

[22:47:22] <OjousamaNoises> also a dragon head
[22:47:29] <Nanobot> Yeah, I caught a little bit of it live.
[22:47:35] <Bco1981> oh, they killed the dragon together ?
[22:47:46] <OjousamaNoises> I've been enjoying the building of mesa mesa road though
[22:47:56] <OjousamaNoises> yeah
[22:48:08] <OjousamaNoises> and then Nene couldn't actually pick it up at the end for like 45 seconds
[22:48:13] <Nanobot> Did they defeat the dragon? I thought they just went out to get elytra.
[22:48:23] <OjousamaNoises> I don't know, I didn't watch the whole stream
[22:48:25] <Bco1981> reminds me i still haven't watched the epic adventure of mona & pekora.
[22:48:27] <OjousamaNoises> I just know they went to do the thing
[22:48:32] <OjousamaNoises> I don't actually know how minecraft works
[22:48:33] <Nanobot> The dragon was defeated ages ago.
[22:48:39] <Nanobot> Although it can be respawned.
[22:48:45] <Nanobot> The elytra is elsewhere.
[22:48:48] <OjousamaNoises> my minecraft knowledge is EXCLUSIVELY from watching random vtubers play it in the background while I do other things
[22:48:57] <JesseDesu> what anime is coming out today
[22:49:04] <Nanobot> To get elytra, you have to go further out and fine an end city with an airship
[22:49:05] <OjousamaNoises> Nanobot: Nene DID get a dragon head though
[22:49:08] <OjousamaNoises> don't know if that means anything
[22:49:16] <Nanobot> The dragon head is just part of the airship, not from the dragon.
[22:49:19] <Bco1981> i've been playing for like 9 years and i still don't know everything.
[22:49:33] <Bco1981> oh that's how you get one
[22:49:54] <OjousamaNoises> I've been‚Ä¶ watching vtubers play minecraft for about a year, that's my knowledge base
[22:49:55] <Nanobot> The dragon head is just attached to the front of the airship. You just have to scaffold over to it and break off the head.
[22:50:19] <Bco1981> silktouch ?
[22:50:25] <Nanobot> Any pick, I think.
[22:50:29] <Bco1981> ah
[22:50:49] <Nanobot> Oddly, you don't get dragon heads from the dragon itself. The dragon just drops xp and opens end portals.
[22:50:49] <OjousamaNoises> anyway, the thing was on a‚Ä¶ frame thing,
[22:50:58] <OjousamaNoises> and Nene spun it around for a while before being able to pick it up
[22:50:59] <Bco1981> and the egg
[22:51:10] <Nanobot> Ah, yeah, the egg.
[22:51:22] <Nanobot> (which does nothing)
[22:51:30] <OjousamaNoises> I caught the end of it, not the beginning
[22:51:33] <Bco1981> you use the egg to respawn i think
[22:52:13] <Nanobot> Bco1981: No, you respawn the dragon by placing end crystals around the end portal in the end.
[22:52:22] <Nanobot> the end
[22:52:50] <Bco1981> oh, i tought you had to have the egg to in the middle of the end crystals
[22:52:55] <Bco1981> thougth*
[22:53:36] <Nanobot> Nope. The dragon egg isn't actually used for anything. You can use it decoratively, and it has a few interesting characteristics in terms of how it behaves when you do stuff to it, but nothing actually depends on it.
[22:53:56] <Bco1981> ah yeah i see.
[22:54:58] <MootPoot> you can sew on the skin onto a onahole and pretend like you're fucking coco
[22:55:20] *** Geela is now known as sscout
[22:55:28] <Nanobot> I believe there's only one dragon egg per world. If you lose it, it's gone forever. Although, server mods can create other ways to obtain it.
