[20:10:11] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> FYI Personally, I prefer to start the server by setting `dotspacemacs-enable-server`to t in my dotfile, because usually the reason for (re-)starting emacs is to 'reset' the interpreter. If you start the server via systemd, then you have to seperately reset the server by restarting it via `systemctl` (or via some other hack). By starting it via the dotfile, you can just use `SPC q r` to restart the server. If
