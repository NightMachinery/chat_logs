[01:06:48] <SantaWasTaken> Have you tried... the simple art of gitting gud?
[01:06:55] <Hunterkll> Do you have an IP block?
[01:06:58] <SantaWasTaken> Both at networking, and asking questions
[01:07:00] <Hunterkll> or did you just get the server itself

[01:08:02] <sd> 09<Yâ€‹ochiro> I just got the server itself
[01:08:04] <sd> 09<Yâ€‹ochiro> no IP block
[01:08:13] <Hunterkll> well, if you don't have any IPs to give your VMs 
[01:08:17] <Hunterkll> how will they network?
[01:08:24] <Hunterkll> you need to buy an IP block 
[01:08:44] <Hunterkll> or at least one failover IP, set up a router VM, and then set up NAT on a separate vswitch via the router VM ....
[01:10:11] <sd> 09<Yâ€‹ochiro> Will try that way, thanks
[01:10:37] <Hunterkll> i highly suggest just buying an IP block, setting up vRack, and putting a vswitch on the second nic and just using straight regular IP configurations
[01:10:39] <rpifan> one of my life goals is to try a bacon butty
[01:11:28] <Hunterkll> without vrack/ip block you're stuck having to manually enter MAC addresses into the manager per-IP, etc
[01:12:13] <Hunterkll> I just have a few /24's assigned to my vrack and just IP servers like normal 
[01:13:14] <sd> 09<Yâ€‹ochiro> Didnt know that i had to bought IP block for VMs. I just though i had to simply setup VM router with one IP, then deserve private IP to VMs
[01:13:41] <Hunterkll> so you'll need at least *one* extra IP
[01:13:49] <Hunterkll> since the IP you're given is used for the management interface
[01:13:55] <Hunterkll> in an ESXi scenario
[01:14:09] <Hunterkll> so you'll need at least one "failover IP" purchased (if you don't get an entire block) to do the setup you want
[01:14:11] <sd> 09<Yâ€‹ochiro> True. Thanks a lot
[01:14:48] <Hunterkll> but yes,after you get that second IP you can set it up like you want
[01:14:55] <Hunterkll> with all VMs just having internal IP space 
[01:15:06] <Hunterkll> I highly reccomend VyOS for your router VM too
[01:15:58] <sd> 09<Yâ€‹ochiro> I'm used to setup PfSense or Mikrotik CHR
[01:16:15] <Hunterkll> for this use case VyOS is more than sufficient

[13:16:37] <SirSantalot> no but a man can dream
[13:23:17] <catbeard> lancehead: what's your questeion
[13:24:46] <Hempux> Im trying to figure out why followprint/equitrac stopped working and the PCC application has mysteriously vanished from the ricoh printers..
[13:25:16] <Hempux> Im starting to wonder if it was there to being with, even tho its referenced in manuals. maybe its built-in in later versions of fw 
[13:25:54] <Activ8> telephones do go down sometimes but not as much as the web, this needs to stop 
[13:27:31] <lancehead> catbeard: so, I have it set up with a 5 login limit and a 10 min lockout. It seems to be working fine, goes by IP/hostname and everything 
[13:27:32] <lancehead> The thing is 
[13:27:45] <lancehead> If I do 4 wrong logins and then one correct one 
[13:27:55] <lancehead> And someone else tries logging in and gets their pass wrong 
[13:28:07] <lancehead> They immediately get banned for 10 mins on the first wrong try because I had the prior 4
[13:28:15] <lancehead> Any way to change that? 
[13:28:47] <lancehead> So that it logs tries by IP as well instead of overall
[13:32:24] <CptLuxx> how often you misstype the password lol
[13:32:46] <lancehead> I was testing it @CptLuxx , so five times on purpose ;) 
[13:32:59] <CptLuxx> use ssh keys
[13:33:00] <CptLuxx> problem solved
[13:33:10] <catbeard> what service
[13:33:17] <lancehead> Not a good solution for our company, CptLuxx
[13:33:21] <CptLuxx> aha
[13:33:31] <CptLuxx> so normal passwords an open ssh
[13:33:33] <CptLuxx> sounds good
[13:33:33] <catbeard> how is ssh keys not a good solution
[13:34:12] <catbeard> or is this for hosting
[13:34:22] <lancehead> this is used to ssh into machines all over the world, and only two people have access rights 
[13:34:42] <CptLuxx> two people
[13:34:44] <lancehead> if those two people lose their keys, all machines would have to be recalled because they can no longer log in
[13:34:45] <lancehead> yes
[13:34:47] <CptLuxx> and ssh keys are not an option
[13:34:49] <CptLuxx> ok....
[13:34:55] <xe0n> because they have a intern with zero real world experience who gets advice off an irc channel setting shit up, what could go wrong?
[13:35:18] <lancehead> Brother I'm just repeating what I've been told, idk either 
[13:35:22] <catbeard> lancehead: i'd seriously recommend re-keying with existing access using something like Teleport
[13:35:22] <CptLuxx> this setup sounds amazing 
[13:35:38] <lancehead> xe0n: u need a hug?
[13:35:42] <catbeard> from what it sounds like right now, it's just waiting to get popped
[13:35:49] <catbeard> also don't forward ssh-agent
[13:35:59] <catbeard> onto servers you don't trust anyway
[13:36:14] <xe0n> imagine having software that can manage ssh keys...
[13:36:39] <catbeard> i mean you could have an SSH CA too so the keys are revocable
[13:36:43] <catbeard> smallstep.com
[13:38:02] <catbeard> fail2ban is just a bandaid here, and doesn't solve the problem of how to filter access to only those that need it
[13:38:18] <catbeard> it just limits the attempts, incorrectly so you say
[13:38:49] <lancehead> I'll suggest that catbeard, thanks. For now though; is there any way to fix that f2b issue I'm having that you know of?
[13:39:04] <CptLuxx> why fix?
[13:39:06] <CptLuxx> its 2 users
[13:39:15] <lancehead> Ask my manager, frankly
[13:39:18] <CptLuxx> how often can they enter the password long lol
[13:39:34] <CptLuxx> and then 10 minute ban what a catastrophe
[13:39:36] <catbeard> https://www.booleanworld.com/protecting-ssh-fail2ban/
[13:40:24] <catbeard> should get you up and running
[13:40:45] <lancehead> CptLuxx: want me to ask him if you can have his email to discuss specifics? If not, I'm just here to ask a question :)
[13:40:53] <lancehead> Awesome catbeard, thanks! I'll check that out 
[13:40:55] <CptLuxx> oh please
[13:41:01] <CptLuxx> i wanna hear what he has to say
[13:43:21] <lancehead> CptLuxx: That was sarcasm; I'm just a little sick of getting laid into when I ask a question in here when I'm not the one deciding stuff like this and it's therefore not my fault lol. It's annoying, it's happened several times now
[13:43:38] <xe0n> tell them to use a connection manager so they dont have to enter the password...
[13:43:44] <lancehead> I'd be fine with a "hey, maybe look into this" but the general attitude is "ur dumb lol"
[13:43:53] <xe0n> and can't really enter a password wrong if its copied (and pasted) from a password manager
[13:43:55] <CptLuxx> well it is dumb
[13:44:51] <lancehead> I get that, but it's not dumb from my side and people do tend to act like that even after I explain I'm just following my internship assignment
[13:47:54] <lancehead> And sure, I could tell my manager he's being dumb, but doing that too often will end up with me no longer having an internship and I *kinda* need it to graduate
[13:48:45] <catbeard> then you should explain the risks of if someone popped that ssh account
[13:49:06] <lancehead> catbeard: This is a very comprehensive article, thanks a lot
[13:49:10] <catbeard> np
[13:49:19] <lancehead> I think they're aware tbh
[13:49:28] <xe0n> shit show in the making.
[13:50:10] <lancehead> I don't exactly know all the details of the environment it'll operate in (and neither do you @xe0n), for all I know it'll work just fine
[13:50:33] <catbeard> does the box this is on have a public ip
[13:50:59] <lancehead> There's a *lot* of other stuff working in combination with this that I have no knowledge of
[13:51:04] <lancehead> The box itself? no @catbeard
[13:51:25] <catbeard> so you got that many people bruteforcing a LAN box?
[13:51:55] <lancehead> Probably not, which is probably why fail2ban is good enough 
[13:52:15] <catbeard> that's kind of what Match blocks are for in sshd_config
[13:52:20] <lancehead> Come to think of it, I guess I know more than I knew 
[13:52:26] <catbeard> limiting the login access per group by IP
[13:52:58] <catbeard> e.g. if the user is in this group, only allow logins from this IP range
[13:53:46] <lancehead> Hmm I guess that could work 
[13:56:54] <catbeard> like set PasswordAuthentication no in sshd_config, then do
[13:57:07] <catbeard> Match Group staff Address 192.168.0.*

[13:57:42] <catbeard> then add your users on that box to staff group
[13:58:17] <lancehead> That could defo work; all the systems these go into are duplicates and use the same IP ranges since they're all airgapped
[13:58:18] <catbeard> then only attempts for users in the staff group can try password authentication, but only from the LAN

[18:48:32] <SirSantalot> yeah but when it's dumb shit like just getting a pc an ip
[18:48:33] <Alternity> we also tend to underestimate our abilities as well
[18:48:39] <Alternity> if anyone could do it they would
[18:48:52] <SirSantalot> I mean, it worked after manually assigning it
[18:48:56] <lancehead> My manager wants me to test out execshield, meaning I have to learn to write a buffer overflow @ SirSantalot so that'll be fun

[18:50:04] <Hunterkll> just put it next to cryptic1's mom
[18:50:06] <SirSantalot> ok, pop quiz, what kind black magic will prevent a computer from getting an IP from dhcp, assuming that it is indeed set to look for dhcp?

[18:50:42] <lancehead> Yeah exhausted DHCP pool would be my first guess as well 
[18:50:44] <Hunterkll> or on a lan segment that doesn't have something like an ip helper to forward the DHCP requests to the DHCP server

[18:51:12] <lancehead> SantasWiFi: I can't code. Like at all, so it'll be a fun thing to learn

[18:52:24] <lancehead> What're you trying to connect that's not getting a lease? @ SirSantalot
[18:52:32] <lancehead> If another device just gets an IP then yeah. most likely 
[18:52:35] <Hunterkll> an ethernet device
[18:52:36] <Hunterkll> lol
[18:52:44] <lancehead> Well yeah, but what kind 
[18:52:46] <SirSantalot> it's a pc in a "machine"

[18:54:17] <SirSantalot> 192.0.4.93
[18:54:33] <SirSantalot> the range it was supposed to get was in 10.0.0.
[18:54:38] <lancehead> Huh 
[18:54:40] <Hunterkll> so again
[18:54:43] <Hunterkll> i'd check the DHCP server

[19:15:17] <Santax> technonerd: global warming is a myth!
[19:15:34] <Santax> it's like 30 degrees above normal where i am.
[19:15:40] <sd> 13<gâ€‹0hl> reason i ask is i'm migrating from SCCM to InTune - currently we just have one big OU for our devices and while we migrate to InTune i'd kind of like to break it up if i can...

[19:15:42] <Santax> gonna get 1-2" of rain over the next couple days.
[19:15:49] <SantaWasTaken> I want some good storms/snow storms this winter
[19:15:53] <Hunterkll> oof
[19:15:58] <SantaWasTaken> I would be so happt with a solid foot or 2 of snow this year
[19:16:03] <Hunterkll> i wish intune could replace SCCM sometimes, but the future is co-managementlol

[19:19:01] <int0x1C8> yeah we got hella wind, I was watching a livestream from 5 til like 11 when I went to bed
[19:19:04] <Hunterkll> @g0hl everything from physical imaging to advanced compliance/remediation policies, bandwidth management, SCCM extensions we've used (like 3rd party product patching), much more capable upgrade task sequence/etc for OS build upgrades, AI features, server management, software metering, etc etc...
[19:19:07] <Hunterkll> I could go on for days
[19:19:16] <int0x1C8> the storm split and went around us lol
[19:19:45] <Hunterkll> we're doing co-management eventually just to add some smoothing/integration headache fixes, but nothing for primary management (we have IBCM set up, etc already)
[19:19:50] <int0x1C8> but we got some rain and some wind, but nothing extreme
[19:20:00] <int0x1C8> still windy as shit

[19:21:38] <sd> 13<gâ€‹0hl> ah okay, gotcha. we're still at a base level of SCCM... like bare minimum packaging. i think we'd want to end up going to that intune version of image deployment rather than sccm. also probably  use that intune branch cache for bandwidth savings.
[19:22:06] <Hunterkll> @g0hl the 'intune version' of image deployment is OEM pre-installed kit only, shipped from vendor, nothing preloaded

[19:24:08] <Hunterkll> the default vendor image is there

[19:24:21] <Hunterkll> like apple DEP 
[19:24:23] <DrZak> yea
[19:24:29] <Hunterkll> it's not a pre-loaded image

[19:26:01] <Hunterkll> that's all up to your or the home user's internet connection, if you can deal with intune often being slower than a properly configured SCCM agent, etc
[19:26:17] <Hunterkll> it's why MS leans heavily on co-management as the primary solution for SCCM shops already 
[19:26:40] <Hunterkll> by virtue of having SCCM alone that already tells me you've got a lot of other stuff, all probably AD joined, going on at the same time
[19:27:00] <sd> 13<gâ€‹0hl> i'll have to look more into co management then and see what we can work out. i know we're far deviated off of the SCCM path and don't have a super good understanding of it. we're all already spread pretty thin.
[19:27:15] <DrZak> as usual
[19:27:16] <DrZak> :D
[19:27:29] <Hunterkll> co-management is basically hooking SCCM and intune together and using both 
[19:27:35] <Hunterkll> it actually expands the capabilities of each other

[22:43:13] <Hunterkll> okay, i guess that's not terrible, but i'd think OSPF would be a simpler fit, but eh
[22:43:48] <Hunterkll> here i am thinking you got dual WAN connections running your publicly routable LIR/RIR assigned space over BGP on the WAN side using a sonicwall as your core routers....
[22:44:01] <Hobadee_> Better question; Who the fuck is running a SONICWALL??
[22:44:10] <DrZak> the hedgehog
[22:44:16] <Hunterkll> actually for an MSP they're pretty fucking neat in some ways

[22:44:21] <sd> 07<sâ€‹zeraax> Lots of SMB use sonicwall. Don't kid yourself.

[22:44:47] <Hobadee_> sâ€‹zeraax, I know.  We used to run a Sonicwall.  Then we got some sense and chucked it in the trash.

[22:48:44] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> :3
[22:49:01] <Hobadee_> Has any distro become the defecto replacement for CentOS?
[22:49:07] <iphone> centos stream
[22:49:11] <Hunterkll> ^
[22:49:12] <iphone> badumtiss
[22:49:28] <Hunterkll> centos stream is basically a mirror of how you *should* be running RHEL 8 in production in most use cases (appstreams enabled, etc)
[22:49:33] <Hunterkll> it's actually not that bad
[22:49:47] <Santax> do people still use admin service accounts?
[22:49:53] <Hobadee_> Ok, why the fuck didn't CentOS Stream show up when I googled "CentOS alternative"?
[22:49:54] <Hunterkll> wut
[22:49:57] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> i want to say alma is winning but I dunno
[22:50:02] <Hunterkll> Hobadee_: because centos steram is just centos
[22:50:04] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> pick your poison
[22:50:06] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> alma or rocky
[22:50:15] <Hunterkll> Hobadee_: like, www.centos.org
[22:50:36] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> iirc it goes fedora -> centos stream -> rhel
[22:50:38] <Hunterkll> https://www.centos.org/centos-stream/
[22:50:50] <Hunterkll> it tracks the RHEL9 support lifecycle
[22:51:14] <Hobadee_> Wait... what the fuck?  I thought CentOS was being killed off?  They are still doing it?
[22:51:15] <Hunterkll> HurdyGurdyBurdy: it's more like RHEL with all the appstreams/current enabled, so pretty much how people run centos anyway when they turn on EPEL and shit
[22:51:28] <Hunterkll> Hobadee_: they killed off the traditioanl fixed in time model centos that 1:1 mirrors base RHEL
[22:51:38] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> muh subscriptions
[22:51:38] <Hunterkll> but with RHEL8 they added app streams / newer versions you can access
[22:51:44] <Hunterkll> centos stream only has the latest versions
[22:51:49] <Hunterkll> you can't pin to a specific set of supported versions
[22:51:57] <Hunterkll> so it's like running RHEL8/9 with all streams enabled to current channel
[22:52:20] <Hobadee_> Ah.  Gotcha.  So aimed at more frequent updates?
[22:52:23] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> yes
[22:52:26] <Hunterkll> think of it almost like rolling release - almost
[22:52:31] <Hunterkll> except still RHEL-level conservative 
[22:52:37] <Hunterkll> just you don't have to wait 4-5 years for a PHP version update
[22:52:41] <Hunterkll> https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/faq-centos-stream-updates
[22:52:44] <Hunterkll> that covers it all
[22:52:44] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> so if you want old school centos then you'll have to go alma or rocky
[22:52:45] <Hobadee_> Is that really a good idea for a server-grade distro?
[22:52:51] <iphone> Hobadee_: centos stream is between fedora and rhel now. it is basically a more stable fedora
[22:52:54] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> my company is rotating off of it
[22:52:58] <Hunterkll> Hobadee_: it's literally how we run RHEL in production
[22:53:03] <Hunterkll> except we're using paid rhel
[22:53:11] <Hunterkll> but it might as well be a centos stream drop in replacement
[22:53:16] <Hunterkll> since we have all the current branches lit on 
[22:53:18] <Hobadee_> speaking as a company who has no budget for actual RedHat, I wouldn't know.  :-P
[22:53:21] <Hunterkll> instead of staying on the "base" supported version
[22:53:24] <iphone> I feel like stream is good enough for most things, and if its not, then just buy rhel licenses
[22:53:32] <iphone> or use up to 16 free rhel licenses
[22:53:45] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> or just go deb/ubuntu :/
[22:53:49] <iphone> that too
[22:53:51] <Hunterkll> iphone: and if you follow red hat guidance and management practices, you might as well be using stream anyway because you're like a week behind/ahead package versions hitting RHEL
[22:53:52] <Hunterkll> lol
[22:54:02] <Hobadee_> I'm not a fan of ubuntu server.
[22:54:05] <iphone> debian is great
[22:54:15] <Hunterkll> ubuntu can blow a bag of donkey cocks with all its fucked up quirks
[22:54:17] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> we run deb on all our shit, i've gotten used to it
[22:54:24] <Hobadee_> Except Ubuntu doesn't do SELinux
[22:54:29] <iphone> same shit, different package manager
[22:54:32] <Hobadee_> Not decently at least
[22:54:35] <Hunterkll> but yes, RHEL configured in the new manner is essentially equivelenet to centos stream, almost 1:1 
[22:54:39] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> fuck selinux lmao
[22:54:45] <haise01> oh boy
[22:54:45] <iphone> selinux is great, fuck apparmor
[22:54:48] <Hunterkll> so you can't even really say it's between fedora and RHEL
[22:54:53] <haise01> SELinux is good shit
[22:54:55] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> I just hate dealin with it
[22:54:57] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> lol
[22:55:07] <Hunterkll> fucking
[22:55:10] <Hobadee_> SELinux is a bitch to deal with, but secure as shit when done right
[22:55:15] <Hunterkll> just run grsec, SELinux, and app armor all at the same time

[22:56:30] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> kek

[22:56:49] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> and just because we can, norton
[22:56:50] <haise01> isn't there MS Defender for Linux as well ?
[22:56:52] <Hunterkll> 100% useful dev server
[22:56:57] <Hobadee_> Run a linux base, with Windows Server running via WINE, which is used to run servers via Cygwin
[22:56:59] <Hunterkll> haise01: i literally just mentioned it

[22:57:06] <Hunterkll> <Hunterkll> with microsoft defender atp running 
[22:57:14] <haise01> oh I missed it :/
[22:57:18] <haise01> time to increase font
[22:57:35] <iphone> do that all in a container
[22:58:00] <Hobadee_> iphone, As long as the containers are running in cygwin, yes
[22:58:33] <Hobadee_> But the containers should emulate ARM architecture and run ARM binaries
[22:58:53] <iphone> but the arm binary is just an emulator for x86
[22:59:09] <Hunterkll> why does this sound like products I actually have used before
[22:59:44] <iphone> and finally python2.7 ./hello_world.py gets ran
