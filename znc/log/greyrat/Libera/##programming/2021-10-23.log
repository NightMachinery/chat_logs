[00:07:40] <lispmacs[work]> Hi, maybe a dumb question: but in computers, if I add together 32-bit integers X and Y, and ignore a carry out bit or overflow flag, the result is simply [X + Y] (mod 2^32), correct?
[00:08:30] <wedr> Sounds about right.
[00:08:39] <wedr> I dunno, need someone else to check on this.
[00:08:52] <flakland> signed integer or unsigned
[00:09:22] <lispmacs[work]> assuming two-complement, does it matter?

[00:09:40] <pikapika> Yes
[00:09:54] <lispmacs[work]> okay, let's say the same question for each
[00:10:25] <wedr> for ones-complement, you will need to take into account a positive zero and a negative zero

[00:12:00] <sgt_chuckles> any devops people here?
[00:12:33] <sgt_chuckles> how can I make a circle-ci job dependent on another one?

[00:20:29] <Rounin> lispmacs[work]: It depends on the architecture, instruction, programming language etc.
[00:21:21] <Rounin> lispmacs[work]: Like, in C, adding two unsigned integers should yield that result, but signed integers are either undefined behaviour or unspecified behaviour or something like that... So they might wrap around, or the optimizer could do something strange, etc.
[00:21:55] *** Joins: ArtVandelayer (~ArtVandel@ip174-68-147-20.lv.lv.cox.net)
[00:23:28] <pikapika> Rounin, I think C does not even enforce 2s complement
[00:23:34] <pikapika> so there's no guarantee even for unsigned

[02:49:58] <arahael> berndj: in my family tree app, i distinguish between "Person", and "Evidence", the evidence seeks to prove that there is a person linked in there somehow.
[02:50:02] <vdamewood> Well, you should at least provide a representative sample.

[02:50:57] <vdamewood> ThingHaver was a tongue-in-cheek suggestion.
[02:50:57] <arahael> berndj: don't make it a subrecord.
[02:51:21] <berndj> vdamewood, i guess i can constrain it as: any entity for which a relatively stable set of natural persons is ultimately responsible

[02:56:16] <berndj> i considered "identity" also, but that's a bit ambiguous. i'm not trying to represent trigonometric identities. just things with ID books or URLs

[02:56:57] <berndj> hey that's not too bad a suggestion
[02:58:10] <berndj> arahael, re: serializing and composition: i'll have a separate table of Evidences, but there will have to be an array of Evidence IDs in the PersonThing record, so i can find them (no SQL-like relational DB)

[09:08:50] <nitrix> A functor is a mapping from something that has a given structure to something else that has another structure. An endofunctor is such mapping from/to the same structure. A monoid is an identity with a binary operation, like 0 with +, or 1 and *. A monad is a monoidal endofunctor.
[09:08:56] <rustyshackleford> hmm I disagree
[09:09:31] <nitrix> It's not horrible to learn, whether you decide to use burritos or the actual terminology, as long as you accept that there are new words to learn.
[09:09:49] <nitrix> The concept itself is rather simple.
[09:10:19] <rustyshackleford> are you sure those words aren't just made up?
[09:10:33] <nitrix> I think all words are made up.
[09:10:42] <rustyshackleford> mind blown
[09:11:27] <rustyshackleford> but so the pair (0, +) doesn't make sense to me
[09:11:33] <rustyshackleford> + is a binary operator
[09:11:55] *** Quits: yeirr (~yeirr@user/yeirr) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[09:12:24] <nitrix> This particular monoid could be named "Addition" and would encompass the idea of folding values of a specific type into a unique value.
[09:12:42] <rustyshackleford> so a monad is something like a function: f(0, +) = (1, -)
[09:13:04] <nitrix> If you have two Int, the + operator, and the value 0, there are a lot of things you can say about this. You can start explaining what "addition" means.
[09:13:19] <nitrix> 0 + 0 folds into 0, for example.
[09:13:28] <nitrix> 0 + (0 + 0) is also 0.

[09:15:12] <rustyshackleford> pure math was fun in college
[09:15:24] <nitrix> Well, a monad is a supposed to be just the operation join :: m (m a), so given a value wrapped by some structure, and the structure is wrapped again by another similar structure, you're supposed to be able to collapse them into a single one.
[09:15:34] <rustyshackleford> I appreciate its usefulness but I think I'm over it
[09:15:39] <nitrix> Have you ever used an Optional type in a programming language?
[09:15:46] <rustyshackleford> yeup
[09:15:56] *** Quits: hexingb (~hexingb@101.30.45.96) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[09:15:58] <nitrix> Like... Optional a = Some a | Nothing
[09:16:22] <nitrix> If you have a value Some(Some(Some(42))), you'd like to be able to collapse that into just Some(42).
[09:16:40] <rustyshackleford> I wanna cry already
[09:16:41] <nitrix> Similarly, if what you have is Some(Some(Some(Nothing))) that's essentially just Nothing.
[09:16:47] <rustyshackleford> why are you abusing optional so badly?
[09:17:04] <rustyshackleford> do you work at my company?
[09:18:05] <nitrix> Because there are function that accepts and returns Optional, and you want to be able to compose them (the input of one is the output of another) and invariably, somewhere down the line, you'll accidently end up with something that's wrapped twice unless you go through the extra care of pattern matching.
[09:18:38] <nitrix> Programming languages with monads have a lot less pattern matching, wrapping and unwrapping all the time, they just implement the "monad" instance that knows how to squish those redundant things.
[09:18:38] <rustyshackleford> so monads, commutivity let you solve a sorta tricky recursive problem more easily
[09:19:25] <rustyshackleford> optionals are useful but I've seen some sorta tricky scenarios they make you deal with too
[09:19:38] <rustyshackleford> to the point where I wonder, why don't we just use null instead?
[09:19:52] <nitrix> Optional is a simple example, but you can go more complicated with things like a Either type for error handling.
[09:20:11] <nitrix> You want two pieces of code that are successful to fold into a single piece of code that's successful.
[09:20:19] <nitrix> If the first piece fails, the second piece shouldn't be executed.
[09:20:22] <Guest8086> are promises monads?
[09:20:31] <Guest8086> and asynch/await/coroutines
[09:20:47] <nitrix> That short-circuiting can be implemented with monads.
[09:21:08] <nitrix> Heck, if you've written middleswares in any modern http frameworks, you're basically doing monads.
[09:21:33] *** Quits: newpy (~newpy@206.168.231.90) (Quit: Leaving)
[09:21:45] <nitrix> It's just that some languages have types for those things, and library functions that are very generic to be able to work with these things.
[09:22:15] <Guest8086> just seems like a recursive abstraction over a value type 
[09:22:41] <Guest8086> that generalizes 'identity' 
[09:22:50] <Guest8086> but why not have any recursive abstraction? why restrict to identity
[09:23:10] <rustyshackleford> I'm either too high for this conversation, or not high enough
[09:23:26] <arahael> Guest8086: It's sometimes said that any time you have a semicolon, you can do that with monads.
[09:23:27] <Guest8086> its like how people ignore goto and pretend it doesnt exist but pontificate about promises and coroutines 
[09:23:31] <nitrix> It generalizes folding operations (merging two things into one) for things that are capable of mapping one structure to another.
[09:23:36] <arahael> Guest8086: They are a *very* generic pattern.
[09:24:01] <nitrix> It's a generic thing for something already generic, that's what trips people's brain I think.
[09:24:31] <nitrix> You have to work with practical examples to get it in my opinion.
[09:24:47] <rustyshackleford> optional was a good example

[09:32:01] <nitrix> rustyshackleford, Essentially, Go doesn't have exceptions, so error handling is very verbose. Very commonly, functions will return an error so you have to constantly check for errors before continuing.

[10:11:50] <nitrix> You don't know whether there's 1 element inside, multiple elements inside, or even, optionally an element inside.
[10:12:16] <nitrix> The concept of "inside" is what makes the type a Functor. It decides what "inside" means.
[10:13:13] <nitrix> Maybe the "inside" is talking to a database to find a value (side-effects), etc.

[10:14:23] <nitrix> All of this is a nice, single Functor interface, with a single method map, and all your types that have some concept of "wrapping something" can implement.
[10:15:10] <decker> foreach is better there ;)   you don't need a new array if you're modifying the existing
[10:15:12] <nitrix> It's an abstraction.
[10:15:24] <decker> and then for( let of ) is better - no extra context allocation and function call
[10:15:26] <decker> right
[10:15:54] <decker> though for let of has issues with letting just any class iterate itself somehow

[15:49:17] <vdamewood> Yeah, 3 floppies for dos and 7 for W 3.11 fW was fine. But after about 12 floppies, you need to CD instead.
