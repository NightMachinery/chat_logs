[17:31:36] <gnoo> i don't see any link to video on that site and it looks too american to investigate more. 
[17:32:12] <gnoo> you can always set the output format to something like -- -o 'title.%(ext)s'
[17:32:30] <donofrio> gnoo, ah I'll try that
[17:32:42] <gnoo> i recently found cmd.exe dosen't like quotes second hand so if that dosen't work try removing the quotes

[21:46:19] <soren_> Are there any reasons to use --xattr in addition to or as a replacement for --embed-metadata?
[21:49:15] <soren_> The latter seems strictly better because the data stored using the former gets wiped if the file is moved to a filesystem not supporting xattr, even if it's moved back

[22:45:38] <Pinchiukas> ede: yeah, like that.
[22:45:47] <Pinchiukas> As I understand currently that's not possible?
[22:52:18] <Pinchiukas> Or maybe it's possible to have few formats with priorities? So that if the first is not available, it would fall back to another one.

[23:21:30] <ede> Pinchiukas: i don't see how if it's not implemented natively. somehow (best*) is defined and used per default. a userdefined list (conf?) would be used instead. a workaround would be to keep your own and use -f with it. every source uses its own system so it would be a lot of work already to just set up such a default list for each of them.
[23:22:03] <ede> i tried to play with the unpacked version before and i really have to get into python back before :/
[23:22:38] <ede> still fascinates me how much fantasy the language designers seem to have :)
[23:23:46] <ede> right now i'd probably just replace the shell code i'd use with something in the init phase and construct the -f parameter before passing control to __main__.
[23:23:58] <Pinchiukas> I mean I don't need the best. I want 1080p60fps mp4. If not, I'd settle for whatever else like vp9 up to 1080p.
[23:24:19] <Pinchiukas> I'm actually using ytdl from mpv. :)
[23:24:51] <ede> heh best is subjective anyway. hard to compare different formats for quality without looking at the frames produced.
[23:25:24] <ede> that new mp4 codec yt uses may be better, but useless if you can't handle it because old codecs :)
[23:25:46] *** Joins: realz (~realz@user/realz)
[23:25:54] <ede> Pinchiukas, how do you make it with yt?
[23:27:00] <ede> if you just want to limit your sources to certain resolutions and codecs or containers you could compose a -f string and use it most of the times probably. or a shell script or a function even.
[23:27:59] <ede> i have 787 files in /extractor/ btw. that really is a number.
