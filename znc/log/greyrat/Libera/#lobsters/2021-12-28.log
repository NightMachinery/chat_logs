[22:05:36] <riv> we try to give good security advice like "use a password manager"
[22:05:56] <riv> then someone invents something that makes you post your passwords to some 3rd party server and calls it a password manager
[22:06:04] <riv> now what are we supposed to do/say....
[22:06:05] <wink> yea
[22:06:11] <wink> but lastpass is OLD
[22:06:30] <wink> before widespread "use a password manager"
[22:07:24] <cb> i need to bug lobsters about an appropriate enterprise password manager
[22:08:19] <c355E3B> cb: for work?
[22:09:33] <rb> i think lastpass existed before google chrome
[22:09:43] <rb> i remember reading about it on a PC magazine from like 2008
[22:10:27] <wink> a keepass file on an smb mount with regular backups is very enterprise :P
[22:10:39] <banna> "with one user claiming that they saw new login attempts from various locations with each password change"
[22:10:42] <banna> yikes
[22:13:11] <jyc> I noticed some password managers even allow you to change your password for a site within the manager now, so itâ€™s one small step to evil :-)
[22:14:01] <c355E3B> I'm also a fan of not buying services for work which don't offer SAML + SCIM
[22:14:34] <cb> c355E3B: yes
[22:14:39] <cb> we dont have any kind of SSO here
[22:14:46] <c355E3B> Do you have AD?
[22:14:48] <cb> no
[22:14:52] <c355E3B> ldap?
[22:14:54] <cb> no
[22:15:02] <c355E3B> umm
[22:15:16] <c355E3B> 1password for teams + gsuite is my recomendation
[22:15:17] <cb> it's less than 10 people and was like 2 for most its life
[22:15:38] <c355E3B> fair
[22:15:41] <cb> we've got fastmail and use nextcloud already so it's harder to justify 365 et al
[22:15:46] <wink> I don't think 1p has a better model of security
[22:15:56] <wink> they just haven't messed up yet, unlike lastpass again and again
[22:16:03] <cb> i was curious about nextcloud's password manager but it sucked bc it doesn't handle sharing w/ groups at all
[22:16:11] <banna> You all don't use post-it notes stuck to your desktop monitors?
[22:16:23] <wink> postit notes are fine if you work at home
[22:16:44] <kline> tbh physical security is probably far safer than ~~the cloud~~
[22:16:54] <c355E3B> wink: IMO every password manager is a risk, but that's more caused by the vendors not supporting sso properly
[22:16:55] <wink> yeah. different threat model
[22:16:57] <banna> It's air-gapped, and if you have terrible handwriting, it is even encoded in a unique cipher!
[22:17:30] <banna> If you take any security training with IT, physical security is one of the more crucial bits
[22:17:50] <wink> c355E3B: I don't see how SSO helps in any form here. that's just a possible layer of mistakes on top (if you have it or not, depending on your view)
[22:17:55] <banna> but in the case of password managers, they should really be used in conjuction with some kind of MFA
[22:18:17] <kline> use `pass` with a yubikey etc for storing the pgp key
[22:18:57] <banna> Most forms of authentication are a balance of ease of use and barring unwanted things from busting in the front door
[22:19:01] <cb> i usee kepass for personal
[22:19:09] <cb> but i was wondering if anyone had better ideas
[22:19:22] <cb> c355E3B: also it's less a PW manager for company resources, and more for resources entrusted to us by clients
[22:19:27] <cb> i.e. VPN creds
[22:19:52] <c355E3B> wink, what i've seen having been on the it/ops side is that people will do really dumb thing with shared accounts (like eveyone use the same lucidchart account and cost us six figures when we go legit...)
[22:19:56] <c355E3B> SSO kinda stops that
[22:20:18] <wink> c355E3B: ok, but completely different problem to your password manager being in the cloud
[22:20:30] <c355E3B> Yes, but made worse by having it
[22:21:00] <wink> I don't get it. if it's in a local text file that everyone can read, they can get the same acc fro mthere as well?
[22:21:23] <wink> I'm strictly talking about lastpass fucking up for the 3rd time in 10 years or so

[23:33:44] <kline> what do you use gpg for just now?
[23:34:27] <kline> i think the main issue with gpg just now is that theres really just 1 "do everything" tool, and more focussed application in different contexts would be better
[23:35:03] <kline> gpg tries too much to be its own environment and ecosystem, its very much not The Unix Way
[23:40:38] <varjag> gpg tries to be pgp
[23:40:55] <varjag> which quite truly was not the unix way
[23:41:58] <varjag> kinda like libreoffice feels strange no matter which distro you run it on, because it's ms office 97 at heart
[23:44:00] <Foxboron> kline: Distro stuff and email :p
[23:44:14] <Foxboron> also password-store because reasons
[23:45:18] <Foxboron> My main problem with all the other options is key discovery. Even gpg being flawed it does work. Where as the other stuff simply has no solutions
[23:45:38] <Foxboron> and I got tired looking up gpg keys from github/keybase/personal websites and across N keyservers.... well this year
[23:46:49] <kline> Foxboron, problem is i dont think age is a drop in replacement for gpg, right?
[23:47:34] <kline> some people will say thats a good thing, but it does mean that any instance where you have gpg use programmed in doesnt work, and you need to have the ability to displace gpg in those places
[23:47:41] <Foxboron> gpg and age isn't comparable
[23:48:09] <Foxboron> I find it annoying when people discuss gpg and just point at age. It doesn't do 10% of what gpg does. Argueably that is a good thing but that doesn't solve anything on my end
[23:48:20] <kline> Foxboron, aside from that, anyway, your mail client should automatically download my gpg key when you write/receive an email for me, as someone finally decided that being able to host keys in a place you can find based on the UID is a good idea
[23:48:41] <Foxboron> wkd<3
[23:48:42] <kline> so when you get an email from kline@libera.chat, it goes to libera.chat and downloads the key associated with kline
[23:49:12] <kline> Foxboron, and yeah, you might find it annoying to have age and gpg compared, but this came about because someone said "im finally replacing gpg with age", but that obviously doesnt work for many use cases!
[23:49:12] <Foxboron> hmm, libera.chat doesn't provide a wkd. So what do you use for that?
[23:49:21] <kline> are you sure?
[23:49:23] <Foxboron> yes
[23:49:27] <Foxboron> Î» ~ Â» gpg --auto-key-locate clear,wkd -v --locate-external-key kline@libera.chat
[23:49:27] <Foxboron> gpg: using pgp trust model

[23:49:53] <kline> kline@libera.chat works here
[23:50:05] <kline> and ive used it to fetch my team members keys in the past
[23:51:00] <Foxboron> hmmmm
[23:51:11] <kline> what do you get with `gpg --locate-key kline@libera.chat`
[23:51:21] <kline> (i only host on wkd)
[23:51:30] <Foxboron> I get nothing
[23:51:41] <kline> sounds like a local misconfiguration then
[23:52:52] <Foxboron> No, I think you are missing the openpgp.libera.chat subdomain
[23:53:21] <kline> thats only required for advanced mode
[23:53:25] <kline> in direct mode you dont need this
[23:53:31] <Foxboron> We had the same issue in Arch Linux
[23:53:32] <Foxboron> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[23:53:51] <Foxboron> It works for my key from archlinux.org so I suspect there is something wrong with your wkd :p I have debugged stuff like this for us
[23:54:15] <kline> ok, then i guess we're at an impasse because ive tested it with a number of other actors and the third party we both see says its fine
[23:54:31] <kline> (but you have pointed out that you think it doesnt work in advanced mode, which is true, because we use direct mode)

[23:54:37] <kline> are you configured to only use advanced mode?
[23:54:46] <Foxboron> errrr, I didn't know there was a difference
[23:54:58] <kline> there is
[23:55:06] <Foxboron> documentation :)?

[23:56:25] <Foxboron> I get the difference. I just don't see how gpg selects one

[23:58:14] <kline> i dont know how gpg selects between the two or why your local install isnt using direct

[23:59:36] <kline> (some people might be thinking "man what a slam dunk, age person gets shown they arent using gpg right", but its actually a massive indictment for gpg that this kind of issue can happen)
