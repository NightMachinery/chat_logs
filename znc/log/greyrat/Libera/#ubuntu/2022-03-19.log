[00:50:51] <Jeremy31> Once you have a backup/image of the Windows install, see if the Ubuntu installer gives you the install along Windows option
[00:51:20] <Dro_> Currently I'm thinking about to do lie this: 100GB for Windows11 - 100GB for / (ext4), 8GB for swap , 92GB for /home - 200GB FAT32 (for data)
[00:51:28] <Dro_> what do you think guys?
[00:52:00] <Dro_> Jeremy31, sure I'll do a backup
[00:52:08] <oerheks> Ubuntu installs in a single partition, but you are free to choose manually
[00:52:25] <Dro_> I'm used to separate / and /home
[00:52:31] <oerheks> let windows make free space, with diskmanagment.
[00:52:43] <Dro_> I'm just thinking about how mucuh space should I leave for each partition :D
[00:53:29] <Jeremy31> I would just let Ubuntu do the repartitioning after making the backup
[00:53:34] <jhutchins> I haven't done a dual-boot (except multiple Linuxes) for a long time, these days I just create the restore disks (for future sales) and nuke it.  For a while, there were rumors you had to use the Windows disk manager to re-size partitions.  I gather that's no longer true?

[00:54:45] <jhutchins> Dro_: Partitioning guarantees that the space you need will be on the wrong partition.  Unless you know EXACTLY where you will need space, do a single partition + swap.
[00:55:14] <oerheks> and windows gives a max available free space possibility

[04:38:27] <impermanence> but then that's when chef-client hits: https://bpa.st/4POQ
[04:39:35] <impermanence> and then in the openssl::upgrade recipe the logic says:
[04:39:37] <impermanence> https://bpa.st/KXXA
[04:39:44] <sarnold> impermanence: package holds are kinda weird, I'm not *too* shocked that an openssl::upgrade recpie wouldn't be prepared to handle some of hte packages being held, others not
[04:40:09] <sarnold> impermanence: but it also feels like the recipe should be prepared to upgrade whatever binary packages are actually installed from the openssl source package
[04:40:19] *** Joins: codedChaos (~William@static-24-233-200-9.md.cpe.atlanticbb.net)
[04:41:13] <sarnold> impermanence: is there a newer version of the recipe? it's not a problem for you yet, but eg focal has libssl1.1 rather than libssl1.0.0 ..
[04:41:49] <impermanence> no there isn't but obviously that is on the horizon
[04:41:56] <impermanence> but I don't understand why it's breaking
[04:42:03] <impermanence> this is xenial
[04:42:53] <impermanence> so openssl::upgrade if after precise then libssl1.0.0
[04:43:01] <sarnold> put it on the list of things that probably needs investigating before too long

[08:19:36] <notnowimbusy> I have hid/revealed the terminal a bunch.  Just now I moved it and played with various buttons.  Dragging works exactly as previously.  When my point reaches the terminal border it switches to an arrow.  When I click to move it, it switches back to a hand.
[08:21:38] <notnowimbusy> It just clicked that I had played around with the "settings" dialog playing with the "natural scroll" setting.  The value I saw for primary button looked wrong so I played with that, but it had been correct.
[08:22:41] <notnowimbusy> I am actually a moderately experienced user, it is gnome et al which are "new" to me.

[13:14:26] <mort> how do you install the chromium package on ubuntu
[13:14:32] <mort> not the snap, the actual package
[13:14:51] <ravage> ubuntu does not provide that anymore
[13:14:59] <mort> that kinda sucks
[13:15:03] <mort> snap doesn't... really work
[13:15:28] <lotuspsychje> cant generalize statements like that mort
[13:15:40] <mort> I can and I will
[13:15:55] <mort> snap is a decent tech demo, but there are just so many issues
[13:15:58] <lotuspsychje> not in the support channel
[13:16:00] <ravage> then please do it somewhere else
[13:16:21] <mort> alright, if you want something concrete: how do you get chromium from the snap to work on wayland
[13:17:19] <ravage> there are support contacts onhttps://snapcraft.io/chromium
[13:17:46] <mort> this would've just worked with the apt package you know
[13:18:01] <mort> somehow, the chromium snap isn't able to connect to the wayland server
[13:18:20] <mort> presumably because some containment bs is preventing it from connecting to the socket
[13:19:08] <lotuspsychje> mort: check the recent chromium bugs; https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/chromium-browser/+bugs?field.tag=snap&orderby=importance&start=0
[13:19:26] <mort> the whole snap experience is chock full of stuff that doesn't properly integrate with the system, doesn't respect your settings, doesn't provide the features it otherwise would, or just doesn't work

[13:20:14] <lotuspsychje> then pick/use alternate browsers of you likings that doesnt snap, like falkon browser for example
[13:20:47] <mort> why should I have to pick a different browser just because canonical is incapable of packaging the one I want? There's nothing wrong with chromium here, canonical just doesn't provide a working chromium package
[13:21:13] <lotuspsychje> there's no use to discuss it here mort volunteers cant help that fact
[13:21:29] <mort> this is the official Ubuntu support channel is it not
[13:22:00] <mort> I'll just compile chromium myself

[18:41:51] <nunya> leftyfb: I solved yesterday's question regarding alphabetizing desktop icons and auto arrange by using nemo-desktop instead of native desktop manager. I installed dash to dock to move menu button to left bottom aligned dock. It also has a nice feature for when I'm only using the laptod display instead of my large monitor. It lets you scroll if there are a lot of "favorites" on the dock. I couldn't get Ubuntu's native dock to do that.
[18:42:24] <nunya> Icons would be all cluttered and stacked on top of each other with native dock

[19:00:07] <zteam> nunya, oh my bad, yeah check the settings in avidemux first I readed to quickly, as a last resort you could try editing the cursor theme if you really wanted to, and if you find the clock there replace it with the the regular icon for your mouse pointer, but that's a really clunky workaround

[19:26:40] <xboxbml> hey all.. I've got home built windows PC in which i threw an old spinner drive i had laying around and installed Ubuntu 21.04 i think some time ago, and let it sit for a while unused. Fired it up and it wanted to upgrade to 21.10 so i let it.. Been trying to get itunes installed and run in wine on a vm inside my mac. nothing but black screen.. unusable. I just today decided to give it a whirl on the PC dual booted to the Ubuntu
[19:26:40] <xboxbml>  21.10 with Wine 7.. It actually works! I think it has something to do with having an actual video card in it.. unlike the VM. I had to go down to iTunes 12.4.3(arbitrarily selected this older version).. as the latest version would not work. black screen and only some characters visible on screen. HD videos will not display though.. itunes wants a monitor that's either built in or supports HDCP.. I had it connected to DVI monitor
[19:26:40] <xboxbml>  when installed and run.. I disconnected and connected HDMI monitor but still says same thing.. I'm waiting for this movie download to finish then will reboot with HDMI monitor connected to see if that changes anything.. Anythoughts on this setup?

[23:40:39] <pycurious> My ubuntu machine just freezes its X at times and then stops to respond. After that I've to power it off and power it back on (When it turns to clean up the SSD etc). I've run memory tests on it - and no errors there. Any ideas on how to debug such an issue?
[23:41:51] <tomreyn> switch to tty when it seems to freeze, login and check error logs, or check them after reboot

[23:42:17] <pycurious> tomreyn: When it freezes, no tty, no ssh - just frozen.
[23:42:48] <tomreyn> so check logs after reboot
[23:43:07] <pycurious> tomreyn: syslog?

[23:46:02] <pycurious> tomreyn: Current time is 4:14. Journalctl -eb -1 shows 12:55:59 as the last line - is that normal? I see some programs connecting/disconnecting….nothing of an error…do i need to scroll long back from the last line of journalctl -eb -1?
[23:47:40] <pycurious> tomreyn: I dont see any serious errors in that command
[23:48:15] <tomreyn> -b -1 makes it show the previous runtime's log.. -e places the viewer at the end of what was logged. so no scrolling should be needed, and you should see the last logs that were recorded for the previous runtime.
[23:48:47] <tomreyn> journalctl --list-boots    shows when boots were recorded
[23:49:05] <tomreyn> which ubuntu release are you running?
