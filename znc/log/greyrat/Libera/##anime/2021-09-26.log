[09:22:30] <ButterNoodle> yea
[09:22:36] <ButterNoodle> it would be crazy
[09:23:33] <jessedesu_onaph> That's nuts
[09:23:45] <jessedesu_onaph> Although honda is a bit boring
[09:23:59] <jessedesu_onaph> It just works
[09:24:52] <ButterNoodle> naa the rrr
[09:24:59] <jessedesu_onaph> Koguma likes it
[09:25:22] <jessedesu_onaph> Did you see rule 34 of supercub
[09:26:10] <jessedesu_onaph> There's a really good one involving the throttle 
[09:29:42] <ZdrytchX> confact whats with #anime kicks? i got kicked from ##anime a while back to move to #anime, so im kinda confused, so we back in double hashes for now?
[09:29:46] <jessedesu_onaph> Triumph Ducati and Aprilia are all more interesting
[09:30:55] <confact> ZdrytchX: #anime is not the real channel, this is. I added a redirect to here and kicked  all. That's why.
[09:31:13] <MootPoot> its weird how motorcycle and car people enjoy stockholm syndrome about their things being unreliable into the vehicles having "soul"
[09:31:18] <ZdrytchX> ah yes im reading the link vohveli linked now
[09:31:50] <jessedesu_onaph> Mootpoot
[09:31:57] <confact> ZdrytchX: i ended up owning #anime so I added redirect. It stopped to work for a while. So that's why you didnt get redirected before.

[09:32:59] <jessedesu_onaph> Confact u had firsties
[09:33:01] <ZdrytchX> on discord/game server administraiton i woukld assign abusers a special "prisoner" tag
[09:33:13] <ZdrytchX> which gave them no rights except specific channels which normal users opt-out of by default
[09:33:23] <jessedesu_onaph> How did you know libera was gonna be a thing
[09:33:32] <jessedesu_onaph> Insider information 
[09:33:36] <ZdrytchX> i started getting kicked from freenode
[09:33:46] <confact> jessedesu_onaph: i just got lucky :p
[09:33:47] <ZdrytchX> and now i cant connect to freenode becuase of the new SSL login thing i cant be arsed registering
[09:34:02] <ZdrytchX> i alreayd have a nickserv identity so why do i need another :(
[09:34:16] <Sadale> nya~ :3
[09:34:27] <ZdrytchX> either way freenode notifications were mostly just superbowl botspam ads anyway
[09:34:47] <confact> freenode have a SSL login now?
[09:35:45] <jessedesu_onaph> Freenode isn't on my network list anymore
[09:35:51] <jessedesu_onaph> I deleted it

[09:36:22] <Sadale> hey! You gay! :<
[09:36:28] <MootPoot> you're a girl

[09:36:47] <Sadale> MootPoot, ok w/e
[09:36:50] <jessedesu_onaph> I'm a girl
[09:36:54] <Sadale> confact, I think you need to register an account on freenode and the only way to join there is to use SASL.
[09:36:55] <jessedesu_onaph> That likes girls
[09:37:38] <MootPoot> SASL = Sexy All Saturday Long
[09:38:00] <confact> everything is connected to sex apparently

I told you, go to Manila and show up at an anime convention and flash your US passport, you'll have legions of Filipino cosplayer girls to choose from
[09:38:24] <tsukkin> sadale not even seeing an option to register an account on their website either
[09:40:18] <jessedesu_onaph> Why is the symbol for databases always 3 hockey pucks
[09:40:34] <tsukkin> jessedesu_onaph because of the canadians 
[09:40:55] <jessedesu_onaph> Damn canadians
[09:40:56] <Sadale> tsukkin, IIRC the registration has to be done on irc.com or something. Anyway I wouldn't recommending joining freenode anymore
[09:41:08] <Sadale> The network is effectively dead
[09:41:19] <ButterNoodle> download irc.com
[09:41:24] <tsukkin> yeah but luke says the real #anime is there 
[09:41:28] <jessedesu_onaph> Can I get a real answer
[09:41:39] <tsukkin> whatever that means
[09:41:44] <ButterNoodle> tsukkin: he still believes in fairy tales too

[09:44:51] <ButterNoodle> F
[09:44:54] <ZdrytchX> i wonder how much their population dropped because of it
[09:44:59] <tsukkin> a lot
[09:45:25] <jessedesu_onaph> Sadale
[09:45:27] <ButterNoodle> who is actually on royal freenode
[09:45:33] <jessedesu_onaph> Do you know
[09:45:37] <Sadale> jessedesu_onaph, nya? :3
[09:45:42] <Sadale> jessedesu_onaph, what answer?
[09:45:51] <tsukkin> butternoodle apparently people who believe in financial equality 
[09:45:51] <ZdrytchX> OOF i googled the chart, its pretty big
[09:45:56] <tsukkin> so like communists maybe ?
[09:46:00] <jessedesu_onaph> Why is the icon for databases always 3 hockey pucks
[09:46:03] * Sadale is a comrade as well :3
[09:46:05] <ButterNoodle> tsukkin: isnt the owner a prince?
[09:46:08] <tsukkin> no clue
[09:46:11] <ButterNoodle> is he sharing his fortune?
[09:46:16] <Sadale> jessedesu_onaph, no idea

[09:46:37] <ZdrytchX> no way librera already has more users
[09:46:43] <Sadale> jessedesu_onaph, found this: https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/31784/what-is-the-origin-meaning-of-the-icon-used-for-database

[09:46:55] <jessedesu_onaph> Ty
[09:47:14] <tsukkin> libera has 174000 users right now
[09:47:28] <tsukkin> and that only includes ones that are joined into channels with at least 5 users
[09:47:42] <Sadale> jessedesu_onaph, after a few decades people'd be asking why the save icon is a purple square with a little grey rectangle on the top with three horizontal lines at the bottom :P
[09:47:50] <ZdrytchX> no wait haha that graph actually says 0 users
[09:47:52] <tsukkin> does that count the same person twice if they join multiple channels though
[09:47:59] <ZdrytchX> because it was last updated on the day freenode required SASL
[09:48:52] <tsukkin> ' everyone who wishes for a world where the people are in power as both the governor and the governed '
[09:48:57] <tsukkin> what does this even mean ?
[09:49:39] <jessedesu_onaph> Sadale
[09:49:47] <jessedesu_onaph> The floppy disk
[09:50:05] <Sadale> jessedesu_onaph, yep. We know about floppy disk. But the new generation won't.
[09:50:18] <jessedesu_onaph> Anyone born after 1995 doesn't know what that is
[09:50:29] <Sadale> jessedesu_onaph, same goes for the 3 hockey pucks database icon. We've no idea on what it is until a google. :P
[09:50:31] <tsukkin> i was born after 1995 and i know what a floppy disk is
[09:50:39] <jessedesu_onaph> Or vcr and vhs
[09:51:13] <jessedesu_onaph> Tsukkin first hand or from Google?
[09:51:23] <jessedesu_onaph> How do you know about it
[09:51:29] <tsukkin> i also know what irc is though so survivorship bias comes into play 
[09:51:42] <Sadale> IRC FTW :3
[09:51:53] <Sadale> Discord sucks *middle finger* :P
[09:51:56] <jessedesu_onaph> Did you ever have like 200 of them in a drawer
[09:52:10] <tsukkin> jessedesu_onaph i have held both a floppy disk and the smaller harder diskettes 
[09:52:15] <tsukkin> never used one for anything though
[09:52:20] <Sadale> The school I went to recommended us to purchase floppy disk. But we never put them into use :/
[09:52:24] * ButterNoodle sucks Sadale's middle finger
[09:52:25] <Sadale> And then floppy disk becomes obsolete.
[09:52:37] <Sadale> ButterNoodle no hentai! >///<
[09:52:40] <tsukkin> my laptop that i used to use for irc had a floppy drive in it 
[09:52:48] <tsukkin> or diskette 
[09:52:50] <tsukkin> the hard ones 
[09:53:01] <ButterNoodle> lemme just clean it off
[09:53:26] <jessedesu_onaph> The 1.44mb ones are floppy disks still
[09:53:40] <ButterNoodle> they aint floppy
[09:54:04] <jessedesu_onaph> The 5 inch ones that aren't hard are the real floppies tho
[09:54:50] <jessedesu_onaph> I had an apple ii from a neighbor friend
[09:55:06] <tsukkin> calling those floppy seems wrong
[09:55:06] <jessedesu_onaph> They had a strip poker software
[09:55:28] <jessedesu_onaph> My dad quickly confiscated that tho
[09:56:40] <ButterNoodle> why
[09:56:48] <ButterNoodle> u wouldnt lettem play?
[09:57:17] <jessedesu_onaph> I was 10 I think
[09:57:24] <jessedesu_onaph> The year was 1995

[10:53:50] <ZdrytchX> no, but australia was still upgrading to the internet

[10:54:23] <ButterNoodle> wow
[10:54:29] <ButterNoodle> imagine having quotas
[10:54:35] <ZdrytchX> we also had this massive CRT that weighed almost as much as a fucking piano
[10:54:45] <ZdrytchX> like literally we could move our piano with only 3 of us

[10:54:59] <ZdrytchX> god fucking damn my fingers every time i lift that shit up
[10:55:14] <ZdrytchX> when i say massive it wasnt atually that massive
[10:55:21] <ButterNoodle> 36"
[10:55:29] <ZdrytchX> i cant remmeber the exact specs but it was something like 38 inch

[10:55:58] <ZdrytchX> or 60 at 1280

[10:58:04] <tsukkin> vvvvvv was a fun game

[14:20:18] <Sadale> amigojapan, right inside the anime they use the megaphone on the car. Anyway the content of this episode made no sense to me. It made no sense to me back when I was a kid, and it makes no sense to me right now as an adult either.
[14:21:04] <amigojapan> Yeah Sadale exactly that, except the car stops near my house and speaks for hours
[14:21:10] <Sadale> woah
[14:21:12] <Sadale> That's stupid.
[14:21:25] <Sadale> Here those megaphone cars would keep moving while speaking
[14:21:26] <amigojapan> Yup
[14:21:57] <amigojapan> Yeah Sadale they stop at 7 11 and talk from there
[14:22:53] <Sadale> What's even the point of using a car?
[14:23:02] <MootPoot> vroom vroom
[14:23:05] <Sadale> Couldn't you just bring in the equipment, stand there and rant all you want?

[14:25:15] <Sadale> aw
[14:25:50] <Bco1981> they probably use a car so they can make a fast get a way if needed.
[14:26:01] <Bco1981> and there is a window they can close if needed.

[14:35:54] <Sadale> But it's legal if you just show the name of your political party.

[19:36:48] <isekaijin> Do modern games require a GPU to play?
[19:37:02] <isekaijin> Or is just a quality of life thing?
[19:37:11] <Bco1981> only if you want 30+ fps
[19:37:17] <DaPinkOne> isekaijin, depends what you consider "modern", but usually, yes
[19:37:33] <Bco1981> the newer amd and intel cpu's with integrated gpu's can... play.
[19:38:04] <isekaijin> I absolutely want 30+ fps.
[19:38:34] <isekaijin> I would buy a third PC just for gaming, but my bedroom has no room for one more PC.
[19:39:02] <DaPinkOne> just buy the graphics card?
[19:39:06] <Bco1981> upgrade one of the existing?

[19:39:58] <Bco1981> put in a extra ssd and install windows on that
[19:40:21] <DaPinkOne> linux/mac does have some modern game support with steam
[19:40:27] <Bco1981> set linux drive as standard boot drive, F11 when you want to game
[19:40:46] <isekaijin> That requires rebooting when you want to play.
[19:40:55] <Bco1981> yeah obviously
[19:41:00] <isekaijin> Rebooting is such a PITA. I leave my PCs turned on 24/7.
[19:41:19] <DaPinkOne> what OS do you run?
[19:41:38] <isekaijin> Arch on both PCs.
[19:41:58] <beaky> nice i like arch
[19:42:19] <isekaijin> Yes, Arch has treated me well, beaky-senpai.
[19:42:32] <DaPinkOne> might look into /r/lowendgaming and/or steam
[19:42:52] <DaPinkOne> steam's got a linux support tag, iirc
[19:43:03] <isekaijin> Thanks.
[19:43:26] <isekaijin> It is sad that my phone is better for playing games than either of my PCs, neither of which is exactly a low-end PC.
[19:43:48] <DaPinkOne> isekaijin, that depends heavily on what type of game you're playing
[19:44:09] <isekaijin> Anything with cute girls, mostly.
[19:44:17] <isekaijin> Cute anime-style girls.
[19:44:28] <beaky> cute girls with h-scenes
[19:44:40] <DaPinkOne> beaky, do you play games on linux?
[19:45:11] <beaky> yes factorio and dwarf fortress and noita
[19:45:25] <beaky> the only games i can run on my 12yo gpu lol
[19:45:43] <DaPinkOne> i was expecting visual novels, tbh
[19:46:25] <DaPinkOne> noita's not bad though. I'm a couple runs in. picked it up on sale a few weeks ago
[19:46:44] <isekaijin> Are visual novels really that interesting, if all you can do is pick among pre-made choices?
[19:47:10] <DaPinkOne> isekaijin, there's a logic tree in the back, but you really don't know what's gonna happen
[19:47:13] <beaky> for vn i jsut watch the vns on youtube like when vtubers play them or kinako game on yt https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8aX9PlW8Xc8xU3ZDlwpdNA/videos

[19:47:58] <isekaijin> Actually, I am very new to gaming. Were I a more experienced gamer, I would probably already have an optimized gaming system.
[19:48:24] <beaky> systems optimized to display cute girls
[19:48:33] <isekaijin> Yes.
[19:50:29] <DaPinkOne> I played fate/stay night's VN for a little bit, and i played a little bit of valkryia chronicles
[19:51:17] <DaPinkOne> the former annoyed me 'cause MC-kun won't stop dyin, and the later was way more content than I expected
[19:51:39] <DaPinkOne> I can't say anything bad about the genre as a whole though, unless you hate reading
[19:51:47] <beaky> sometimes mc-kun gotta die to protect the cute girls he loves
[19:52:02] <DaPinkOne> beaky, unless it's the cute girl doin the killing :<

[22:10:35] <Cryowolf> it's a MSI Tomahawk B550, has a lot of heatsink stuff on it and shielding and whatnot
[22:11:01] <lastonestanding> does it have WIFI?
[22:11:08] <Cryowolf> what you should do is create a thermosiphon cooler with copper
[22:11:22] <Cryowolf> nope sadly it doesnt have wifi or bluetooth :< but those are cheap to get
[22:11:29] <Cryowolf> bought 4.0 bluetooth for 20 euro
[22:11:54] <Cryowolf> I don't think a good wifi is that much either
[22:12:17] <lastonestanding> copper?!
[22:12:25] <Cryowolf> but I use cable cause a wifi that will match what I'm upgrading my internet to won't withstand much
[22:12:32] <Cryowolf> copper and aluminium
[22:12:32] <lastonestanding> since when do you write it like that?
[22:13:18] <Cryowolf> to lead the vapor up, where it cools down, perhaps with the help of some other gas or device
[22:13:34] <Cryowolf> and then it sinks because it gets cold and cools it down
[22:14:05] <lastonestanding> wouldn't it make more sense to produce electronics which do not generate so much heat?
[22:14:12] <Cryowolf> thermosiphon for CPU has been proven to beat out water cooling and it's still in early stages
[22:14:45] <MootPoot> does it matter though
[22:15:21] <MootPoot> normals dont actually need it for anything that a current cooler can't do just fine 
[22:15:33] <MootPoot> and overclockers will go LN2 anyway
[22:15:37] <Cryowolf> lastonestanding, yes it would, if the technology existed in a...price range that wasn't only for the rich
[22:15:45] <Cryowolf> LN2?

[22:16:28] <Cryowolf> thermosiphon will still beat out any watercooler, both in maintenance and effect
[22:16:37] <MootPoot> yes but why does it matter
[22:17:00] <Cryowolf> because it costs less and you dont need to replace parts or worry about pipes bursting and destroying your computer
[22:17:14] <MootPoot> sounds like a job for air cooling

[22:17:45] <Cryowolf> yes high end aircooling will outperform most watercoolers
[22:17:47] *** Joins: solaraquarion (~solaraqua@pool-141-157-225-211.nycmny.fios.verizon.net)
[22:17:58] <MootPoot> I'm failing to see the utility aside from "because I want it"
[22:18:34] <MootPoot> air is cheaper, less maintainance and as you said does better then most water
[22:18:40] <Cryowolf> cheaper, don't need to replace parts, keeps a OCd CPU cooler than watercooling does, less risk of leaks
[22:18:50] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, until you OC it to extreme levels
[22:19:05] <MootPoot> yeah, so basically for just "because I want it" group
[22:19:05] <Cryowolf> then it stops outperforming water cooling
[22:19:09] <Cryowolf> high end anyway
[22:19:14] <MootPoot> it dosen't really enable anything new
[22:19:37] <Cryowolf> or the "I want to play everything on ultra with maximum fps, stability, hz etc"
[22:20:01] <MootPoot> not that its a bad thing, I just dont see why anybody aside from the extreme overclockers would really care
[22:20:03] <Cryowolf> or the "I need this computer to run this rendering effectively in this farm"
[22:20:14] <MootPoot> Cryowolf: you can do those things with air just fine
[22:20:23] <Cryowolf> not a render farm no....
[22:20:34] <MootPoot> server racks still use air
[22:20:38] <MootPoot> and they do just fine
[22:20:47] <Cryowolf> render farms are in rooms that are in -20 to -40 C
[22:21:17] *** Quits: solaraquarion (~solaraqua@pool-141-157-225-211.nycmny.fios.verizon.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:21:18] <Cryowolf> they don't just use air
[22:21:23] <MootPoot> yes, but the actual cooling from cpu -> outside is still just normal air , the fact that they precool the air dosen't really change much
[22:21:26] <Cryowolf> they use very very cold air
[22:21:35] <MootPoot> the density of the computers would require that anyway
[22:21:41] <MootPoot> even if you had thermosiphons
[22:22:05] <Cryowolf> thermosiphons would enable people at home to start doing more of it
[22:22:06] <MootPoot> Its cool tech, dont get me wrong
[22:22:19] <MootPoot> Cryowolf:  how so?
[22:22:27] <Cryowolf> especially if they make homemade thermosiphons that can keep CPUs down much more
[22:22:38] <MootPoot> they can't make render farms at home with air?
[22:22:50] <Cryowolf> not really powerful ones
[22:22:59] <MootPoot> also, removing more heat from the cpu just makes the ambient that much hotter, requiring air pre cooling anyway
[22:23:06] * MootPoot shrugs
[22:23:26] <Cryowolf> it would require a heat pump in the room
[22:23:36] <Cryowolf> not a room cooled to -40
[22:24:15] <MootPoot> how so? If anything you would need less external cooling with normal air cooling since less is output
[22:24:17] <Cryowolf> also, those thermosiphons have some form of actual refridgeration on them
[22:24:33] <MootPoot> making it dispose of more heat with a thermosiphon would make your room cooling demands MORE severe
[22:25:11] <Cryowolf> uuh in the end the heat is still expelled by fans
[22:25:25] <MootPoot> so then what does it actually change?
[22:25:45] <Cryowolf> I said that from the start

[22:41:15] <MootPoot> weak
[22:41:15] <Cryowolf> cause there's no such thing as bacterial infection 
[22:41:35] <Cryowolf> omero, that's a really bad thing to teach
[22:41:48] <omero> Cryowolf: we're still alive
[22:42:03] <omero> and survived battles...
[22:42:04] <Cryowolf> you realize the sterility relies entirely on the person who has the pee, being healthy right?
[22:42:17] <omero> lol
[22:42:30] <Cryowolf> plenty of nations survived doing stupid shit
[22:42:37] <omero> I said that vodka is better already, Cryowolf

[22:43:23] <Cryowolf> Yeah I do
[22:43:29] <omero> good.
[22:43:33] * MootPoot waits for applause
[22:44:16] <omero> but I wouldnt mind drinking loli pee van het tap. risk? ok. my take.
[22:44:27] <Cryowolf> Urine still contains bacteria and how harmful it is depends entirely on what bacteria is in there. It also depends on how healthy and effective their kidneys are
[22:44:39] <omero> you dont get it eh?
[22:45:06] <Cryowolf> Loli's filter their urine into the fountain of youth
[22:45:17] <Cryowolf> how do you think they live for thousands of years?

[22:46:13] <Cryowolf> you forgot my follow up
[22:46:31] <Cryowolf> but I dont think thats how you add a quote

[22:49:00] <Cryowolf> leave my quotes alone
[22:49:07] <MootPoot> The future of PC cooling is massively spread out cpu dies on one board, all passively cooled
[22:49:23] <omero> then you would have one unnecessary quote, Cryowolf 
[22:49:34] <omero> the one you didnt like. want to keep it?
[22:49:37] <MootPoot> Imagine a 10x10 motherboard covered with risc-V 5w tdp chips

[22:50:03] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: (21 / 29) <C​ryowolf> My quotes really make me shine as a person
[22:50:04] <omero> you selfquoted
[22:50:09] <MootPoot> LOL
[22:50:11] <Cryowolf> What are you talking about? I don't have a quote I don't want. I added it
[22:50:26] <MootPoot> That quote in context with the newly added one
[22:50:45] <MootPoot> Talking about Loli pee makes you shine as a person
[22:50:45] <Cryowolf> the quote in context with 99% of my quotes
[22:50:53] <omero> selfquoting is quite ... lame.
[22:51:08] <MootPoot> It's frowned upon here
[22:51:11] <Cryowolf> omero, doesn't bother me
