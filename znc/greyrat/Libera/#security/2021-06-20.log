[16:21:04] <velix> e4vo3xmpqqa3: Okay, I really thought apparmor could help here.
[16:21:30] <velix> pam_apparmor looked very promising :(
[16:22:12] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> i dont know much about apparmor but prefer cheating catch alls to provide functionality so i dont have to maintain horrible amounts of path based policy against upstream changes : /
[16:22:56] <velix> linux really lacks of a sane multi-user permission system.
[16:23:03] <velix> it's not designed for multiple users :(
[16:23:25] <velix> at least, not for multiple untrustful ones.
[16:24:06] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> would just cheat /bin /sbin /lib /lib64 + /usr with 0750 and force group access to get binaries :) but then im a bit weird
[16:24:54] <velix> e4vo3xmpqqa3: Then user could simply run `/lib/ld-linux.so chmod -R 0777 /bin`
[16:25:11] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> nah not without being root
[16:25:29] <velix> e4vo3xmpqqa3: Doesn't he need to access ld-linux for normal applications?
[16:25:47] <velix> e4vo3xmpqqa3: I just want to disallow single applications, not all.
[16:26:00] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> you can make full static binaries if you really want but it doesnt matter what you execute if you dont have permissions to change the file
[16:26:25] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> all my suid binaries are 0750 with explicit group access which would allow what your on about
[16:27:04] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> ive cheated all of it using busybox tho can give all users a basic shell then force group permissions to touch any other binary if i wanted to get granular about it
[16:27:04] <velix> e4vo3xmpqqa3: Since I'm on Debian, every `apt upgrade` might vaporize this ;)
[16:27:25] <velix> e4vo3xmpqqa3: yeah, good old rbash and chroot might do? ;)
[16:27:48] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> i did say im a bit weird :P i build all my images from a real os and the stuff running is ephemeral without a package manager installed
[16:28:19] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> you could just alias upgrade='apt upgrade;./harden-permission.sh' if you really wanted
[16:28:32] <velix> yeah. an after-upgrade hook
[16:29:09] <velix> Thanks, I'll try.
[16:29:28] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> dont think randomly hooking unused libraries into other binaries would do alot tho ? it would need to be your own library thats hijacking function calls, and if your user can only write to a noexec path itll failed when linking
[16:30:01] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> if you cant hook a library it was using or find a collision in function names that actually does something useful it would be pretty inert
[16:30:28] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> your suppose to preload your own library and overwrite the functions in pre existing so its hooking and executing your code without read write access to an exec mount path it fails anyway
[16:31:29] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> only read write space on my install is noexec mounted, so any binary or library drop cant be executed regardless
