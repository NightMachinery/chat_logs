[00:17:34] <Batzy> hey Z-module, say i have a set of words on 4 symbols, like A, a, B, b. If i take words of length l and consider the D_l group action on this set, do you think there's an easy way to tell if a word has a symmetry that's lexically ordered before it without just iteratively checking the symmetries? (D_l is the dihedral group and A^_1 = a, B^-1 = b). also if anyone besides z mod knows lmk

[00:19:00] <Batzy> yes
[00:20:24] <greenbagels> ok so when you say symmetry, in this case is it symmetry with respect to the Dl action?
[00:20:31] <Batzy> yes so like
[00:20:34] <greenbagels> like if the word is w, and the element of Dl is g, gw = w?
[00:20:36] <Batzy> yxx is a symmetry of xxy
[00:20:42] <greenbagels> ok
[00:20:52] <Batzy> and so is xyx and so on

[14:54:24] <riv> good idea
[14:54:33] <cadmio> so k = dr and d = 2h +1
[14:54:53] <riv> so we need to show that  2^((2h+1)r) + 1   can be factored
[14:55:16] <cadmio> yes
[14:56:33] <riv> consider (X + 1)(X^(2h) - X^(2h-1) + ... + X^2 - X + 1)
[14:57:28] <riv> you have: X * (X^(2h) - X^(2h-1) + ... + X^2 - X + 1) = X^(2h+1) - X^(2h) + ... + X^3 - X^2 + X
[14:58:01] <riv> so when you add that to 1 * it, all the terms cancel out except the first and last

[18:57:24] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: to see why forward images can fail to preserve intersections, take A = B = {1,2}, f:A -> B defined as f(anything) = 1, then  f({1}) cap f({2}) = {1} cap {1} = {1},  but   f({1} cap {2}) = f({}) = {}.

[19:08:17] <[itchyjunk]> oh duh
[19:08:21] <Z-module> for arbitrary unions you need:  If {C_t : t in T}  is any indexed family of subsets of A  (doesn't even need to be countable), then   f(cup_{t in T} C_t) = cup_{t in T}  f(C_t)

[22:22:12] <cadmio> hey
[22:23:09] <Z-module> Just use the very general/useful fact (that you can prove first):   if m is an odd positive integer, then for any integers a, b (or really any two commuting elements in any ring at all):     a^m + b^m = (a + b)( a^(m-1) b^0 - a^(m-2) b^1 + a^(m-3) b^2 - ... - a^(m-(m-1)) b^(m-2) + a^0 b^(m-1) )
[22:23:44] <Z-module> It's a simple telescoping thing.

[22:25:53] <Z-module> More generally, for a positive integer m:   a^m - b^m  is always divisible by a - b,  and   a^m + b^m is divisible by a + b if m is odd.
[22:26:03] <cadmio> so the text is using a known algebrai identity
[22:26:20] <Z-module> Such as   a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)
[22:26:24] <cadmio> 'cause I wasn't able to see how that showed up in the text
[22:26:37] <Z-module> it's a simple identity that you should internalize and use a lot

[22:31:10] <Z-module> Or ignore all that, for your problem, and just think about integers mod 3.  If m is odd, the  2^m = (-1)^m = -1   (mod 3), so 3 divides  2^m + 1.
[22:31:51] <Z-module> So if m > 1, then 2^m + 1 is composite.

[22:32:04] *** Joins: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv)
[22:32:35] <cadmio> the argument on another text is that if k has an odd factor t then 2^k + 1 has (2^(k/t) + 1) as factor
[22:32:35] <Z-module> well, you need more than that
[22:32:41] <Z-module> yes
[22:32:49] <cadmio> I'm not sure if it's because the same telescoping identity

[22:39:54] <harwiltz> Hello all. I know that the closed unit ball in a normed vector space is compact iff the space is finite-dimensional. Can the same be said about a closed ball of unit radius in a metric space?
[22:42:02] <Z-module> harwiltz: whatever is true about the closed unit ball around the origin is true about *all* the closed balls of positive radius anywhere.
[22:42:09] <Z-module> I mean, topologically
[22:42:21] <Z-module> you can write down a simple homeomorphism about any two of those

[22:43:04] <Z-module> Oh, sorry, in a general metric space there is no "origin"
[22:43:31] <Z-module> so it's not a thing in general metric spaces
[22:45:19] <Z-module> harwiltz: in other words, a general metric space isn't even a vector space, in general, so you can't even talk about dimension

[22:49:16] <Z-module> TVSes are quite special lovely things.

[22:50:11] <Z-module> Math people are weird, right? Most people would say a lovely warm apple pie is lovely, but a ...... vector space? WTF??
[22:50:24] <harwiltz> Yes... I'm working on something with my supervisor that deals with a metric space of probability measures. I suggested that we try to find some transformation to a vector space, but he wasn't thrilled with that idea
[22:50:36] <harwiltz> Z-module: Idk doesn't everyone find TVSs beautiful?\
[22:51:20] <Z-module> heh
[22:52:19] <Z-module> I know a guy, in fact, very very gifted, who got a math PhD at Princeton, and then 2 years later totally left the whole field. He said, "Math is just all made up!"
