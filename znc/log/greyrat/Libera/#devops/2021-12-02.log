[00:10:42] <Latrina> sup mofos?
[00:10:58] <lantech19446> hey Latrina not much just setting up my lab for learning ansible
[00:11:08] <Latrina> cool man
[00:11:13] <Latrina> I am learning ansible as well
[00:11:30] <Latrina> I mean, I can get by with it. But I need to get better at it
[00:11:58] <lantech19446> I don't know any yaml so the most i've done so far is setup a controller and a couple targets and i can get them to ping
[00:13:13] <kwilczynski> Ansible.
[00:13:26] <kwilczynski> Makes me want to re-read Ender's Game.
[00:13:27] <kwilczynski> ;)
[00:16:45] <lantech19446> lol
[00:17:05] <kwilczynski> Good series, by the way.
[00:17:09] <kwilczynski> So.
[00:17:11] <kwilczynski> Ansible.
[00:17:15] <kwilczynski> YAML.
[00:17:50] <lantech19446> I just ran into something odd, I added my web server to the hosts file and it failed on the first host and seems to have hung on the webserver
[00:26:26] <kwilczynski> Make sure SSH connectivity works.
[00:28:11] <lantech19446> it is it started running when i tried a second time, now I just need to figure out how to add credentials to like known_hosts or something because I want both nodes in the same group but they don't have the same user
