[00:00:36] <tabakhase> goddard where/how thats running? CI usually has shell fail mode on, so it stops on error, no need for oyu to "manually handle it" (set -e)
[00:02:01] <goddard> tabakhase: yeah i tried that
[00:02:11] <goddard> its apart of a github action
[00:03:37] <tabakhase> that should do just that already - unless you call a script from it, in this script (say you have a build.sh that gets run) you have to re-set it (or bash -e build.sh)

[00:05:17] <ada_> artok: nice
[00:06:28] <ada_> ph88: the directory that you are trying to look for would have to be contained in the build context
[00:06:39] <ada_> ph88: what problem are you trying to solve by doing this?
[00:07:21] <ph88> i didn't want to run a command before `docker build` to put the binary somewhere
[00:07:27] <ada_> ph88: maybe you just have a large build context with many many files, but you don't want to copy all of them, only a certain file?  but if that's the case, why do you need to find it dynamically?  if your project structure doesn't change, wouldn't the file path be constant?
[00:07:47] <ada_> s/directory/binary
[00:08:44] <ada_> ph88: so to use an example, if you had a binary at /usr/local/bin/foo, but your build context was ~/project, the COPY would fail, because /usr/local/bin/foo is not underneath ~/project 
[00:08:59] <ph88> oh
[00:09:25] <ph88> the build context is the directory where the Dockerfile is right ?
[00:09:40] <ada_> technically it's the path you supply to 'docker build' command
[00:09:56] <ada_> usually everyone uses the . for "current directory" and yes that's usually where the dockerfile is
[00:10:23] <goddard> tabakhase: i will give that a shot i tried setting it inside the script itself 
[00:10:42] <ada_> if you had a project at ~/project and your binary was at ~/project/bin/foo and your dockerfile was at ~/project/dockerfiles/Dockerfile, then you could set your build context to ~/project and it would contain both the dockerfile and the binary

[04:22:21] <tabakhase> thats literally what it does - not even a docker thing
[04:22:58] <bancroft> yeah I mean, outside of docker sure I can be sure if I make a tmpfs but inside ... still a bit magical, too many unknowns 
[04:23:26] <BtbN> You can't from the inside of it. But you can when setting up the container.
[04:24:15] <tabakhase> click the dam link :P

[04:24:35] <bancroft> lol i'm still reading hold your horses man
[04:25:46] <bancroft> hmmm only with docker on linux 
[04:26:17] <tabakhase> if youre using docker, its 99% of the time "On linux"
[04:26:35] <tabakhase> windows docker - as in windowsNT containers that run exe´s in hyperV - does almost noone
[04:26:51] <bancroft> yeah but, I had to do some weirdness to get docker on raspbian lite 
[04:27:08] <bancroft> it's still linux, i'm just wondering if that will still be ok 
[04:27:23] <bancroft> pi cluster 
[04:27:24] <tabakhase> thats ARM, so ye you cant use x68 stuff
[04:27:49] <tabakhase> most "popular" images have variants for that
[04:29:02] <tabakhase> but for anything else, that a linux like any other =)
[04:29:27] <bancroft> tmpfs is x86 only? waah?

[04:31:37] <tabakhase> vs say, https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql?tab=tags&page=1&ordering=last_updated - only amd64 (also works on intel64bit, historic naming so dont get confused there)
[04:32:14] <tabakhase> so say for mysql, using mariadb instead (a fork) be the better option, as they have all architectures again https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb?tab=tags&page=1&ordering=last_updated

[04:33:22] <bancroft> i'm using this as base https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu

[04:35:59] <bancroft> good to know, thanks 
[04:37:30] <tabakhase> "current docker" likely has that fixed - but "back when multi arch was added" it was kinda a hack ontop of the existing image/manifest format so things could get pretty messy :D

[11:07:25] <gebbione> hi folks, i would like to run npm or other build commands and the main problem is loading credentials ... ie .npmrc file with tokens , .known_hosts etc ... Is there a way to add files outside the context ... ie ADD in Dockerfile from ~/.ssh for instance? As at the moment i am getting some permission errors and i need to find a way to include these files without mounting them
[11:09:51] <aminvakil> what do you mean by including these files without mentioning them?
[11:10:49] <aminvakil> gebbione: also have you seen these: https://docs.docker.com/language/nodejs/build-images/ https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp/
[11:11:31] <gebbione> mounting ... 
[11:12:59] <gebbione> those articles don't solve the problems of authenticating with private repos
[11:13:07] <gebbione> this is the problem i have
[11:13:23] <gebbione> i m already using a node image with npm inside 
[11:14:07] <gebbione> but when i npm install it wants to verify the GitHub fingerprint even if i add a known_host
[11:14:23] <aminvakil> ah, sorry i misread
[11:18:03] <gebbione> usually with composer (php) i have no problems but i am getting stuck with npm
[11:19:21] <gebbione> managed to fix the host verification problem
[11:19:28] <gebbione> lets see the others :/

[17:07:25] <rapid16> I'm using nginx image and connected via interative shell. IT doesn't have ifconfig and trying ot see the container's IP
[17:07:35] <rapid16> Do containers not have their own IP?
[17:08:29] <rapid16> I can't access nginx via browser calling localhos
[17:10:46] <artok> rapid16: normally you start port forwarding with containers, so hostip:port is going to container:port
[17:11:05] <rapid16> Which config does that go into?
[17:11:14] <artok> docker run -p
[17:11:40] <rapid16> docker-compose shows "80:80"
[17:11:53] <rapid16> It does it under nginx image settings
[17:12:09] <artok> well there you have that your hostip:80 is sent to container port 80
[17:12:21] <rapid16> Hmm. Then why can't I access it
[17:12:52] <rapid16> I can't get nestat either...package isn't found
[17:13:34] <rapid16> Is mysql supposed to be blocking when calling docker-compse up
[17:14:08] <artok> nothing should be blocking
[17:14:11] <rapid16> Hmm
[17:14:20] <rapid16> Then I guess there is a problem
[17:15:43] <rapid16> Here is the output and configs https://gist.github.com/shortbit/2f579f49fa2c56b30394911a9dadc67a

[17:16:11] <rapid16> What does that mean?
[17:16:52] <rapid16> HOw do I put it blocking?
[17:20:31] <rapid16> Do I need -d argument to docker-compose?
[17:21:57] <akik> rapid16: containers have an ip address from each of the user defined networks you connect them to
[17:23:44] <rapid16> It's part of app-network
[17:23:51] <rapid16> I don't know of an IP for that

[17:24:38] <akik> rapid16: you can see them with docker container inspect
[17:24:45] <artok> container ip can change but daemon will keep your port forwardings going on, and internal dns keeps record between container-container
[17:25:28] <rapid16> docker container inspect isn't a valid command

[17:31:44] <artok> is that php app based on apache php ?
[17:32:01] <artok> or you have apache running on your localhost and therefore your nginx cant bind to that port ?
[17:32:09] <akik> rapid16: in the container? use docker exec to go there as root
[17:32:18] <artok> localhost being now that host
[17:32:22] <rapid16> I did that already
[17:32:42] <rapid16> I cannot find apache or nginx config files
[17:34:38] <rapid16> This is stupid...why would sudo not exist
[17:34:56] <artok> because there is no need
[17:35:44] <rapid16> Then why does trying to install something say it is?
[17:35:49] <artok> starting the container being root and de-escalate to some user, rather than starting as some user and escalating to root
[17:36:37] <akik> rapid16: are you now just testing and not creating your own Dockerfile?
[17:36:52] <artok> and while docker exec into container is effective, remember that it isn't that persistent
[17:36:57] <rapid16> I don't rememer how I got the dockerfile
[17:37:35] <akik> rapid16: you can put all the commands in Dockerfile. they'll be run as root. then it's reproducible
[17:38:55] <rapid16> Hmm.
[17:39:05] <rapid16> I don't know why there is apache and no apache config files
[17:40:01] <akik> rapid16: the files will be at the same directories as when you're not using containers
[17:40:13] <rapid16> That's where I'm checking
[17:40:21] <rapid16> Only place they sould be
[17:40:24] <rapid16> should*
[17:40:33] <akik> rapid16: use the package manager to check
[17:40:54] <rapid16> Check for installation?
[17:41:16] <artok> depends on whose images using, if there is some custom way for the service
[17:41:41] <rapid16> I'm about ready to just stop trying
[17:42:02] <akik> rapid16: that took what, an hour?
[17:42:51] <akik> rapid16: if it's an image built on debian/ubuntu, it's dpkg, alpine, apk, centos, yum/dnf
[17:43:17] <rapid16> What do you mean by it took an hour?
[17:43:22] <akik> rapid16: don't stop now as you're just getting to speed
