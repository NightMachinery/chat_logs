[05:13:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yes, coffee is world saying hello to you with drugs to apologize for waking you
[05:15:08] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: java is a fake language
[05:16:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I honestly don't understand why java is synonymous with coffee, it's hardly the first place to have grown it
[05:17:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Arabia has a much stronger claim to it.
[05:17:29] <MootPoot> light roast best roast
[05:17:30] <MootPoot> fight me
[05:17:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm obligated to agree because it has a higher concentration of caffeine than dark roast.
[05:18:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It so happens that sufficient roasting denatures caffeine.
[05:18:31] <MootPoot> also
[05:18:46] <MootPoot> you can keep light roast warm for longer on the hot plate without it tasting burnt
[05:18:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I suppose that would also be true.

[12:35:59] <mixfix41> well to get a better experience
[12:36:03] <mixfix41> theres always something better
[12:36:05] <Bco1981> atmos
[12:36:25] <amigojapan> Ok death916 back. Yes I love 711 :)
[12:36:41] <Bco1981> 5.1/5.2 is only 2D audio... Atmos is 3D
[12:36:43] <amigojapan> death916: but for fried chicken Lawson is better
[12:37:03] <amigojapan> death916: and family mart send cheaper
[12:37:28] <mixfix41> is it breast cuts too?
[12:37:31] <death916> i jus went n got subway cuz it was that or jack n the box
[12:38:08] <amigojapan> death916: never had Jack n the box
[12:38:16] <death916> its just greasy fast food
[12:38:22] <death916> burgers n stuff
[12:38:29] <amigojapan> I see
[12:38:42] <MootPoot> Cock in the box
[12:38:52] <death916> nothing open by my work at this hour
[12:38:52] <Bco1981> MootPoot: gn
[12:38:57] <JesseDesu> MootPoot, gn
[12:39:55] <mixfix41> id been deep frying chicken leftovers it would be nice to marinate it before it cook it 
[12:40:06] <mixfix41> or fry or whatever
[12:41:53] <mixfix41> moot even you should save up for 1964 ears we should probs trade pictures of our earsets just in case there is a bottom to it analyze each component..
[12:43:14] <mixfix41> but also beer can chicken leftovers is pretty good to deep fry since i start to use that at first
[12:43:53] <theholyduck> mixfix41: i think stop trying to sell people on the idea of buying a 500++++ dollar iem
[12:44:17] <mixfix41> what?
[12:44:45] <mixfix41> its only a suggestion
[12:44:53] <mixfix41> i truly work towards caraudio
[12:44:58] <mixfix41> so im not sure about your attitude
[12:45:16] <mixfix41> yea
[12:45:22] <theholyduck>  most peoples audio needs are not THAT demanding. and like  most people would be much better served by 250 bucks airpods pros or 280 bucks WF-1000XM4
[12:45:31] <mixfix41> the pieces costs half of a nice amp for a car sub system thats totally true!
[12:45:40] <mixfix41> true true
[12:45:53] <mixfix41> but if you understand the meaning of my message its pretty benign
[12:46:15] <mixfix41> (ok whatever)
[12:46:25] <amigojapan> mixfix41: I am fine with yeah audio,I don't even listen to music
[12:46:36] <mixfix41> you couldve just suggest it along altogether instead confront me tho
[12:46:47] <amigojapan> Trash audio*
[12:46:56] <mixfix41> me too
[12:46:59] <mixfix41> im just saying
[12:47:03] <mixfix41> its nice to get input sometimes 
[12:47:13] <theholyduck> mixfix41:  :P its just. you brought up that somebody should save up for 500+ dollar IEMS that basicly nobody needs
[12:47:15] <Bco1981> i like it when i can feel the music
[12:47:16] <mixfix41> like a football pass and receive its not saleman cold calling
[12:47:30] <theholyduck> out of nowhere. 
[12:47:39] <mixfix41> out of nowhere, not exactly
[12:47:40] <theholyduck> again 
[12:47:47] <mixfix41> i dont just post the link to the site out of nowhere
[12:47:52] <mixfix41> it was in the flow of conversation
[12:48:06] <mixfix41> but if we end it here then i think its less cat fighting about it and moving on
[12:48:26] <mixfix41> just confrontational about the price i get it,
[12:48:46] <theholyduck> mixfix41:  partially the price and partiall the pointlessness of the
[12:48:52] <mixfix41> funny cause id relate that way too im in no means sitting pretty financially

[12:49:35] *** Katrin is now known as KatrinValerie
[12:49:43] <theholyduck> mixfix41:  i mean i could afford 500 dollar IEMS. i just dont see the point. ive tried some nice ones and theres really very little to them
[12:49:49] <KatrinValerie> onegai weechat-san accept my new default nickname
[12:49:57] <theholyduck> again basicly no audiophile wank ever passes ABX testing anyway
[12:50:10] <mixfix41> hmm 
[12:50:14] <theholyduck> mixfix41:  i use some nice sony over the ear bluetooth headphones
[12:50:14] <mixfix41> interesting
[12:50:17] <theholyduck> with noise canceling
[12:50:18] <KatrinValerie> theholyduck: just make affordable boxes that sound decent yourself
[12:50:26] <mixfix41> yet i only suggest it if 500 is murderous then fml
[12:50:32] <KatrinValerie> There's plenty of decent tutorials for audiophile diy speakers
[12:50:38] <theholyduck> KatrinValerie: not talking speakers :P
[12:50:40] <mixfix41> 500 = good pair of subs 500 = half the price to power them
[12:50:41] <theholyduck> talking earbuds
[12:50:41] <theholyduck> :P
[12:50:43] <mixfix41> im not blind 
[12:50:48] <KatrinValerie> theholyduck: DIY them too
[12:50:50] <KatrinValerie> !
[12:50:56] <theholyduck> KatrinValerie:  :P still pricy :D 
[12:51:01] <theholyduck> and still mostly pointless
[12:51:05] <KatrinValerie> theholyduck: you just need an extruder
[12:51:08] <theholyduck> i prefer the convenience of bluetooth audio
[12:51:12] <KatrinValerie> something to cast silicone in
[12:51:21] <mixfix41> i have bluetooth, 15 dollar shrapnel skate speakers
[12:51:24] <Bco1981> KatrinValerie: i think that is the way i have to go, the day my old speakers start to disolve
[12:51:33] <mixfix41> i have a bt beats unopen box too
[12:51:39] <mixfix41> just saying
[12:51:47] <mixfix41> just suggest it along next time
[12:51:49] <theholyduck> again nobody is saying beats by dr dre is any good
[12:51:50] <KatrinValerie> Bco1981: I need to fix my logitech boxes, I didn't put them up since moving in with my girlfriend.
[12:51:50] <theholyduck> :P
[12:51:57] <mixfix41> i dont think confronting me about a lavish product is a best move
[12:52:02] <theholyduck> its a fashion acessory
[12:52:13] <Bco1981> 22years old... they could break any moment.
[12:52:17] <theholyduck> mixfix41: im mostly just weirded out by your obsession with trying to convince other people to buy super expensive IEMs
[12:52:28] <death916> lol
[12:52:29] <KatrinValerie> Am I a u-haul lesbian if I am moving in with my second gf after little over a year of really knowing her?
[12:52:30] <death916> this again
[12:52:31] <mixfix41> not obsession its irc obsession but not an obsession
[12:52:38] <death916> no
[12:52:40] <death916> yr is good
[12:52:53] <death916> i moved in wit my gf after 6 months
[12:53:00] <death916> im not a lesbian nor do i have a uhaul
[12:53:02] <death916> but alas
[12:53:03] <mixfix41> irc/oss obsession 
[12:53:10] <amigojapan> Congrats death916 
[12:53:11] <theholyduck> KatrinValerie: i thought lesbians drove subarus?
[12:53:14] <theholyduck> not u-hauls
[12:53:17] <KatrinValerie> well with the first I moved in after a few months
[12:53:18] <death916> thx
[12:53:39] <KatrinValerie> or basically instantly
[12:53:42] <theholyduck> like subarus has been like the official cars of american lesbians for decades 
[12:53:47] <theholyduck> according to what ih eard
[12:53:51] <death916> also hipsters
[12:53:54] <death916> and hipster lesbians
[12:54:00] <KatrinValerie> Like the second date just didn't really end and she stayed at my place from that point on xD
[12:54:09] <death916> lool
[12:54:13] <KatrinValerie> we just went to her parents place to pick up clothes at that point
[12:54:27] <KatrinValerie> I should have seen the warning signs, she really only wanted to escape from her parents
[12:54:50] <KatrinValerie> well, I don't doubt feelings were involved as well, but it didn't run as deep as we initially thought
[12:55:02] <KatrinValerie> death916: we were all like, oh we will grow old together and stuff

[12:59:14] <KatrinValerie> A monogamous girl wrecked it though

[12:59:40] <KatrinValerie> I want a Subaru now
[12:59:41] <theholyduck> emmeka: i mean thats a chicken and an egg problem
[12:59:43] <emmeka> but the u-haul reference, I never understood
[12:59:49] <KatrinValerie> Maybe I have BPD after all
[12:59:51] <theholyduck> i thought the lesbians bought subarus first
[12:59:59] <mixfix41> are the airpods actually that good though?

[13:02:35] <amigojapan> midgardlol: isekai of rats
[13:02:47] <theholyduck> amigojapan: i bring them up as a more practical alternative for MOST people who are looking to spend big money on some form of earbud
[13:02:57] <theholyduck> thats a lot cheaper than 500 bucks iems
[13:02:59] <mixfix41> but i am still going to buy car subs and amp one day

[13:03:36] <theholyduck> my car has very little noise isolation

[13:07:09] <mixfix41> yea
[13:08:29] <mixfix41> see for me not to be ignorant and present a expensive equipment is to actually know the other products and i cant possibly have time to learn them

[14:58:07] <nicotiana> you can predict the future but it doesn't have to follow your prediction closely or at all

[15:04:01] <amigojapan> Precent
[15:04:33] <nicotiana> I don't believe the world is that way
[15:04:49] <amigojapan> Well I do
[15:05:39] <amigojapan> nicotiana: first of all. Do you agree that we can predict exactly how chemical reactions will react?
[15:08:24] <amigojapan> nicotiana: tomako promised she will end her manga shopping spree after spending 200usd on manga
[15:08:48] <isekaijin> Whoa.
[15:08:59] * isekaijin wants to go on a manga shopping spree too.
[15:09:04] <nicotiana> no, I don't agree amigojapan
[15:09:16] <amigojapan> isekaijin: manga is expresive
[15:09:36] <amigojapan> nicotiana: you don't believe in chemistry?
[15:09:53] <isekaijin> It is entertaining. And the characters are often very well drawn.
[15:10:27] <isekaijin> amigojapan: Rather than ‚Äúpredict‚Äù, it is more like we already know how chemical compounds will react, based on prior experience.
[15:10:30] <amigojapan> isekaijin: this is in a period of 3 days
[15:10:45] <isekaijin> But there are some cases of accurate prediction in chemistry too.
[15:11:12] <amigojapan> isekaijin: and we know exactly what will happen if we mix them again, right?
[15:11:38] <isekaijin> Of course, if you mix the same compounds under the same conditions again, the same reaction will happen.
[15:12:01] <isekaijin> But that is not so much a ‚Äúprediction‚Äù. You have already seen it happen before.
[15:12:20] <isekaijin> A prediction is when you can tell something will happen, even though you have *not* seen it happen before.
[15:12:22] <mixfix41> is it because its deuplicating emotional feelings
[15:13:00] <amigojapan> isekaijin: right. Then everything in the universe is made of chemicals or energy. And behaves in completely predetermined ways including our brains
[15:14:25] <Publios> amigojapan,  it seems that way, but at the quantum level things behave only within certain probabilities. you can't actually predict exact behavior
[15:14:35] <Publios> and that's just the start
[15:14:39] <amigojapan> Conclusion: free will is an illusion
[15:14:41] <isekaijin> Mmm. I do not think our current understanding of science is good enough to claim that beyond all doubt.
[15:15:07] <mixfix41> theyve master ddrug manufactering isnt that true though
[15:15:12] <Publios> no
[15:15:25] <amigojapan> Publios: random values don't give you a free will
[15:15:41] <mixfix41> chemicals in the range of our emotional experience not all drugs we need 
[15:15:45] <Publios> amigojapan,  ok, I'm not arguing about free will or not tho
[15:16:03] <amigojapan> isekaijin: sure,but we can say evidence points in that direction
[15:16:19] <amigojapan> Alright Publios 
[15:16:19] <Publios> amigojapan,  but random values in the chemical and quantum world do challenge your presuppotions about energy and chemicals behaving in predetermined ways
[15:16:47] <Publios> atoms and energy SORT of behave in predetermined ways
[15:17:01] <isekaijin> In any case, to the best of my knowledge, quantum mechanics is about measurements, not about ‚Äúfree will‚Äù or anything like that.

[15:18:57] <Publios> no, but if one bases one arguments that free will doesn't exist because our brains and decisions are made on chemicals and energy and those things behave in predetermined ways then if those things don't actually behave in predetermined ways then you cannot say free will doesn't exist based upon their behavior
[15:19:18] * nicotiana gives amigojapan some interesting medicines
[15:19:45] <isekaijin> amigojapan: Regarding buying $200 worth of manga in 3 days... not too long ago, I spent roughly the same amount in a combination of music albums and Super Chats, and also in under a week.
[15:19:57] <Publios> psychotropic medicines do not at all affect everyone the same way - this is especially clear when it comes to antidepressants and anti-psychotics
[15:20:14] <Publios> for one person an anti-depressant can turn them suicidal, for another the same one works wonders
[15:20:30] <Publios> their brains don't have fundamentally different structures or neurotransmitters
[15:20:46] <mixfix41> thats really odd assessment given the side effects and affects of srri's
[15:21:13] <amigojapan> isekaijin: I would never do that. Maybe on computer things(when I can afford it
[15:21:16] <mixfix41> though you are right it does probs help people , genuinely?
[15:21:17] <Publios> that being said, certain ssris work well in related individuals
[15:21:38] <Publios> mixfix41,  I take an ssri that works very well for anxiety and OCD
[15:21:45] <isekaijin> amigojapan: In retrospect, I agree that it was not money well spent. I mean, the albums were okay, but the Super Chats were excessive.
[15:22:13] <Publios> when I'm on this SSRI it is far easier to resist doing compulsions
[15:22:22] <amigojapan> isekaijin: how much was the biggest superchat?
[15:23:07] <isekaijin> amigojapan: About $25 given the current exchange rate, but it was worth more last year.
[15:24:01] <isekaijin> And, yes, spending on computer things is a better way to spend money. :-)
[15:24:20] <amigojapan> Publios: that is because everyone has a different brain chemistry. We can only think "this has worked for most people so it may work for him too"
[15:25:02] <Publios> amigojapan,  that's not really true
[15:25:03] <KatrinValerie> The wound on my head itches

[17:21:49] <Cryowolf> you usually feel soreness after an injection in the shoulder, especially of a vaccine
[17:22:20] <Bco1981> amigojapan: yesterday i asked the guy that gave me my shot, how far in they go. because you hardly feel it. he said about 3-4cm.
[17:22:48] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: yes you feel soreness but the injection itself was painless
[17:23:04] <mixfix41> yea iv needles dont even hurt thats another hurdle to wrap around but if they lack practice they can leave a mark

[18:11:03] <mixfix41> !later tell theholyduck: so i do a small skim: and found this "And Apple iPod stock headphones are generally crapped upon by anyone and everyone.  Your $12 headphones should give you markedly superior sound if you get them sealed in your ears properly." here: https://forums.rockbox.org/index.php?topic=14880.0 so i think this does support your side a bit more as well. but its nice to mention!!!!

[18:15:12] <beaky> o
[18:15:16] <Bco1981> Java minecraft is shaders.
[18:16:46] <Bco1981> i think there is only 1 shader that make use of global illumination effects and actually using the rt cores.
[18:17:08] <Bco1981> SEUS PTGI
[18:18:31] <Bco1981> oh.... that's a no for that one too.  It does not take advantage of hardware acceleration on RTX cards. This isn't possible for now.
[18:22:05] <hassoon> Bco1981: aaaaa shar'ap
[18:22:26] <Bco1981> hassoon: my mobs are cuter then yours
[18:23:30] <isekaijin> Bco1981: Sadly, Minecraft alone is not worth wasting a perfectly good machine by installing Windows on it.
[18:23:48] <Bco1981> true, it's everything else.
[18:24:00] <Bco1981> since minecraft java is crossplatform
[18:24:06] <mixfix41> linux != windows remains true
[18:24:11] <mixfix41> both have something
[18:24:44] <mixfix41> actually if you launch mingsys you get some good goodies in there too
[18:25:00] <mixfix41> emacs is built with it i saw in its filepath
[18:25:02] <amigojapan> Windows has all the games and the office software :(
[18:25:14] <isekaijin> Office is useless.
[18:25:26] <isekaijin> If you want to generate pretty documents, you need LaTeX.
[18:25:37] <isekaijin> And if you don't mind your documents looking like shit, you might as well use Google Docs.
[18:25:55] <amigojapan> isekaijin: but if you work in an office sometimes they force you to use it
[18:29:06] <mixfix41> i will only play pubg if it runs natively on linux id never buy it otherwise
[18:29:14] <amigojapan> isekaijin: and exchange too
[18:29:22] <ButterNoodle> latex play in the office is nice
[18:29:52] <amigojapan> L3wd
[18:30:08] <ButterNoodle> is that a fork of latex?
[18:31:08] <isekaijin> Is it possible to ‚Äútransfer‚Äù a Windows license from one machine to another?
[18:31:18] <ButterNoodle> depends on the license
[18:31:24] <ButterNoodle> oem vs retail
[18:31:41] <hassoon> Bco1981: what's a mob
[18:31:44] <ButterNoodle> I think u get 5 activations with retail
[18:31:55] <isekaijin> Oh.
[18:32:10] <ButterNoodle> but you can always call MS and play stupid and get anything activated
[18:32:10] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: how does it know it is on a different machine?
[18:32:20] <ButterNoodle> wdym?
[18:32:26] <ButterNoodle> hwid
[18:32:37] <mixfix41> ive done that once, the systems kinda broken
[18:32:40] <isekaijin> This is regrettable. I would buy a Windows license if I were allowed to transfer the license to another machine whenever I want to.
[18:32:50] <mixfix41> but it did do it eventually
[18:32:51] <ButterNoodle> I mean...
[18:32:52] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: ah ok activation counted. I see
[18:33:12] <ButterNoodle> just use the activation bypass tool
[18:33:26] <mixfix41> at first windows 8 was complaining cause i swap the hard drive to a different mobo. then i return it to the original one i install it on so i had to call in
[18:33:44] <mixfix41> windows 8 in particular windows 7 i can swap around
[18:34:01] <ButterNoodle> kms something boku no pico something to fix that
[18:34:02] <mixfix41> ah
[18:34:03] <isekaijin> I do not mind using pirated software on virtual machines, but on physical machines I would rather install a legal copy of the operating system.
[18:34:26] <ButterNoodle> when u can get an oem key for <$20 why not
[18:34:51] <ButterNoodle> bought a few dozen and only had one go bad from a vendor that oversold
[18:34:53] <mixfix41> cause we like standing in the rain and feeling wet ButterNoodle 
[18:34:58] <hassoon> ow no, my cat insists on sleeping on my chest
[18:35:20] <ButterNoodle> hassoon: as long as it doesnt poop on ur chest
[18:35:30] <ButterNoodle> is it cold?
[18:35:43] <hassoon> ButterNoodle: absolutely the opposite
[18:35:47] <ButterNoodle> or is it plotting ur demise so it can consume you
[18:35:50] <hassoon> ButterNoodle: hottest days of the summer
[18:35:57] <ButterNoodle> yea
[18:35:57] <hassoon> 40C is a joke now
[18:36:05] <hassoon> it's mid 40's
[18:36:09] <hassoon> or closer to 50
[18:36:14] <isekaijin> Holy shit.
[18:36:20] <hassoon> he has been seeking a cold spot
[18:36:33] <ButterNoodle> jfc.. u live in the Sahara?
[18:37:06] <ButterNoodle> hassoon okiwotsukete
[18:37:08] <amigojapan> hassoon: if your don't have AC you could spend the day at a mall
[18:37:52] <hassoon> amigojapan: nah i have a room fan, it's relativly enough to some extent
[18:38:01] <hassoon> amigojapan: otherwise i just lie on the floor
[18:38:04] <hassoon> floor is always colder
[18:38:21] <amigojapan> HM hassoon don't get heat stroke
[18:38:24] <hassoon> ButterNoodle: north africa, but meh, sahara is not far from here
[18:38:45] <hassoon> amigojapan: na don't worry, i don't go outdoors at this time of day, it's 3PM

[18:39:32] <hassoon> mixfix41: ya ww2 battles reached this place true
[18:39:48] <amigojapan> hassoon: you can also take many cold showers
[18:39:48] <hassoon> it's strange though
[18:40:31] <hassoon> my cat is often an uncivilised clueless pet, who is obsessed with biting whoever touches his arms/feet
[18:40:33] <mixfix41> they have some old war documentary when i had my htpc up and running i still have and its pretty informative with very short real clips from 
[18:40:42] <hassoon> maybe aging up is making him wiser and slower
[18:41:03] <mixfix41> the clips footages capture breath taking scenary and view and war
[18:41:03] <hassoon> he is now like 3 and 2 months years old, or a little older
[18:41:44] <hassoon> amigojapan: true, water is my friend during these times

[20:36:38] <hassoon> Nanobot: ah, not really, the story that technique, is that its main creator (ryo) gathers cosmic energy in his arm, and use it to power up his arm and fist, making those very fast punches, he is a character seen in many fighting games by SNK, such as the art of fighting (the one in the video), or the King Of Fighters, which is a bigger series
[20:37:12] <Jigsy> The only KoF character I know is Shiranui Mai.
[20:37:18] <Jigsy> ...for entirely different reasons. ;>
[20:37:28] <hassoon> Jigsy: yep, from Fatal Fury series as well

[20:37:40] <hassoon> Jigsy: ya i know your reasons :p

[20:38:29] <Jigsy> One of the great wonders if the Jigsy world, one might say!
[20:38:52] <hassoon> Nanobot: anyway this is a video showing up Ryo accross many games doing his fantastic zanretsuken technique
[20:38:54] <Nanobot> In 6th grade, we had a lesson on portmanteaus. We were given a list of a couple dozen portmanteaus and had to write down what words were being combined. I completed all of them pretty easily, except for one: "co-op". I couldn't figure it out. I asked my teacher if I could get a hint, and he just told me to figure it out on my own. I ended up being the last person to turn in the assignment. I ended up writing "corporate operation", but I was pretty sure 
[20:38:54] <Nanobot> co-op was actually just "cooperative". I ended up getting that question wrong. The correct answer was "cooperative". THAT ISN'T A PORTMANTEAU! I really hated that teacher.
