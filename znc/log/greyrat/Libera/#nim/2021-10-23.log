[01:33:16] <FromDiscord> <tandy> [leorize](https://matrix.to/#/@leorize:envs.net)\: why does `currentType` return `or[int, string]` shouldnt it just return a single type?
[01:34:27] <FromDiscord> <leorize> currentType gets you the type discriminator, which is an enum
[01:34:45] <FromDiscord> <leorize> I suppose that name might be confusing \:p
[01:34:46] <FromDiscord> <tandy> oh
[01:35:05] <FromDiscord> <tandy> yeah lol
[01:35:22] <FromDiscord> <tandy> is there a way to infer the current type of a union type field?
[01:35:35] <FromDiscord> <tandy> `var v2: type(currentType(v))`
[01:35:39] <FromDiscord> <tandy> i was tryna do this
[01:36:27] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's not statically known so nope
[01:36:36] <FromDiscord> <tandy> hmmm
[01:36:37] <FromDiscord> <leorize> the variants iterator will get you the variants of the union type
[01:36:53] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Based off runtime information it could be `int` or `string` presently, it'd need to be a union ðŸ˜€
[01:37:10] <FromDiscord> <leorize> which you can use to generate `if x of typeA: x as typeA`, and things like that
[01:37:34] <FromDiscord> <tandy> hmmm
[01:37:44] <FromDiscord> <tandy> well it would need to work genericaly
[01:37:50] <FromDiscord> <tandy> cos jsony
[01:38:19] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Generics are statically known ðŸ˜€
[01:38:54] <FromDiscord> <leorize> you can coerce the types
[01:39:21] <FromDiscord> <tandy> how?
[01:39:31] <FromDiscord> <tandy> / wdym
[01:40:07] <FromDiscord> <leorize> so you will want to generate a dispatch for jsony to dispatch based on what is the current type of the union
[01:40:43] <FromDiscord> <leorize> to do this, use the `variants` iterator to get all types contained within union

[15:19:20] <FromDiscord> <tandy> ohhh im so silly
[15:19:36] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> you need to convert cstring to string or something along those lines using `$`

[15:21:07] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Or if there is no `newTableRef` constructor that takes sequence you can construct it in a loop

[15:33:46] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> noob question: if I declare with "let" instead of "var", I know it's immutable, but is using "let" faster (more efficient) or is it more a case of good practice to make sure nothing changes that shouldn't?
[15:35:06] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> it has no performance implications, but it is a good practice to use `let`
[15:35:26] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Because it makes it easier to read the code since you know there are no after-edits

[20:41:18] <FromDiscord> <Hamid Bluri> In reply to @Rika "templates are copy-paste": i guess sometimes i have to relearn what i've already know ðŸ˜•

[20:46:53] <Mister_Magister> its running fine for like 20 minutes then starts spewing : No route to host [OSError] and doesn't recover
[20:51:35] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> tbh nim docs are bit of confusing for me?
[20:51:48] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> maybe that's just because i am coming from rust with it's docs.rs
[21:00:18] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> i see no obvious mistakes in your codeâ†µ(<@709044657232936960_=4dister_=4dagister=5b=49=52=43=5d>)
[21:00:57] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> do you have a stacktrace?
[21:12:28] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> Does `Dimscord` support slash commands?
[21:12:53] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Yes
[21:13:07] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @Illusive "tbh nim docs are": Whatâ€™s confusing
[21:13:34] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> Good, can you link to the slash commands documentation then please?
[21:20:58] <FromDiscord> <rainbowasteroids> nim strings are stored as UTF8 strings, right?
[21:24:25] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> no, nim strings are byte sequences
[21:38:56] <FromDiscord> <rainbowasteroids> what makes nim strings different from seq[char]?
[21:40:11] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> as of right now - nothing
[21:40:34] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> but this is considered an implementation detail and should not be exploited
[21:41:09] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> For working with Unicode in nim strings, look in the `std/unicode` module
[21:42:34] <FromDiscord> <rainbowasteroids> > â†µ> as of right nowâ†µ> does that mean there's plans to make strings more than just `distict seq[char]`?â†µ>
[21:42:50] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> string is not a `distinct seq[char]`
[21:43:05] <FromDiscord> <rainbowasteroids> [Edit](https://discord.com/channels/371759389889003530/371759389889003532/901533573008486540): > as of right nowâ†µdoes that mean there's plans to make strings more than just `distict seq[char]`?
[21:43:11] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> they are implemented identically, I haven't said they are the same type + `distinct`
[21:43:51] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> In reply to @Illusive "Good, can you link": https://github.com/ire4ever1190/dimscmd
[21:43:52] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> But string and `seq[char]` have the same memory layout and management behavior
[21:43:54] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> answer for myself
[21:44:39] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> for example you are allowed but advised not to `cast[seq[char]](<some string>)`
[21:45:22] <FromDiscord> <rainbowasteroids> So is there any plans to change nim strings in the future?
[21:45:31] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> none that I'm aware of
[21:54:36] <Mister_Magister> @illusive they are confusing as heck
[22:01:16] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> In reply to @Mister_Magister "<@790153860130799616> they are confusing": the nim docs in general are pretty confusing for me
[22:01:19] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> lol
[22:01:44] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> what do you find confusing?
[22:02:11] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> In reply to @enthus1ast "what do you find": so let me explain in terms of rust
[22:02:18] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> so rust has crates.io and docs.rs
[22:02:27] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> first one is kind of repo for all rust programs
[22:02:40] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> and docs.rs is one repo for crates docs
[22:03:06] <Mister_Magister> me coming from php, they are confusing as heck
[22:03:09] <Mister_Magister> hard to find any info
[22:03:13] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> in nim there's isn't i think the central place where to get documentation
[22:03:31] <Mister_Magister> most of time i come ask here because finding it in docs will take me literal hours
[22:03:55] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> well there is nimble.directory   but i must admit i like to just read the nim docs or the project docs
[22:04:07] <Mister_Magister> for example in response to my issue
[22:04:08] <Mister_Magister> https://nim-lang.org/docs/asynchttpserver.html#serve%2CAsyncHttpServer%2CPort%2Cproc%28Request%29%2Cstring%2Cint

[22:05:03] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Hit's hidden for sadly but it's there
[22:05:04] <Mister_Magister> here you get the confusing part
[22:05:12] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> this was hidden because some new user find it confusing \:)
[22:05:39] <Mister_Magister> xd
[22:05:48] <Mister_Magister> anyway can someone help me please
[22:06:02] <Mister_Magister> worst part is that it doesn't recover
[22:06:22] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> i think its not in your code
[22:06:32] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> your code looks ok i guess
[22:06:49] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> can you provide a stacktrace?
[22:06:52] <Mister_Magister> well i know that much :P
[22:06:56] <Mister_Magister> sure
[22:06:58] <FromDiscord> <Hamid Bluri> let me see
[22:07:57] <Mister_Magister> https://paste.opensuse.org/081b898c heres stack trace
[22:08:12] <FromDiscord> <Hamid Bluri> i didn't that i can define tuples that way : /
[22:08:19] <FromDiscord> <Hamid Bluri> i didmt know
[22:08:25] <FromDiscord> <Hamid Bluri> damn
[22:08:43] <Mister_Magister> you live you learn
[22:09:09] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> bruh moment https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/371759389889003532/901540261849624606/unknown.png
[22:09:12] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> 1.2 is ancient
[22:09:18] <Mister_Magister> 1.4 does same thing
[22:10:39] <Mister_Magister> now i did choosenim devel, cleared cache and recompiled
[22:10:46] <Mister_Magister> will test if it still happens
[22:12:42] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> the message is strange never encountered "No route to host" while reading from a socket
[22:13:39] <FromDiscord> <Hamid Bluri> i have nim devel 1.7.1
[22:14:12] <FromDiscord> <Hamid Bluri> is running it for 20 mins enoght to produce the error?
[22:14:16] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> in nim
[22:14:28] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> is there a some kind of requirements.txt file? like in python?
[22:14:43] <FromDiscord> <Hamid Bluri> In reply to @Illusive "is there a some": we put that in package.nimble
[22:14:56] <FromDiscord> <Hamid Bluri> well `package` is your package name
[22:15:01] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> yeah
[22:15:05] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> it is obvious
[22:15:11] <FromDiscord> <Hamid Bluri> you can init a package by `nimble init`
[22:16:05] <Mister_Magister> @Hamid its really hard to tell what causes the error, but it needs requests i think
[22:16:52] <FromDiscord> <Hamid Bluri> can you make a postman file for to make request to those routes?
[22:17:00] <FromDiscord> <Hamid Bluri> for me
[22:18:00] <Mister_Magister> http://localhost:9100/addMetrics?name=x&value=x&metricType=x&client=x and http://localhost:9100/metrics
[22:18:06] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> maybe you can use "ab"
[22:18:11] <Mister_Magister> whats ab
[22:18:28] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> "ab - Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool"
[22:18:40] <FromDiscord> <Hamid Bluri> Ø¢Ø¨ means water in my lang
[22:20:15] <Mister_Magister> i think it could be due to how im making requests. i'm doing requests to it from esp that just requests said url and then turns off wifi so that could cause no route to host if it tries to read
[22:20:22] <Mister_Magister> but i don't like that it doesn't recover
[22:23:03] <FromDiscord> <Hamid Bluri> send the stack trace if you could produce it with new nim version
[22:23:27] <Mister_Magister> oki
[22:28:19] <FromDiscord> <Hamid Bluri> @Minster_Magister you can use `OrderedTable` by the way
[22:29:41] <FromDiscord> <Hamid Bluri> and you don't need to define all these funcs `[]`, `[]=`
