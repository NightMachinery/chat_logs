[00:02:47] <rudybot> cvanduse`: Another difference between law and code is that if you a discover a loophole in the law, a judge will likely say, "I see what you did there" and use the obvious commonly-understood situation.
[00:02:48] <bpalmer> I wonder how much "remote" work is going to be actually spreading out around the country vs just living a little further away from the cities.
[00:02:51] <technomancy> I started watching the Man in the High Tower and it was like "what if America, but with Nazis" and then I realized "wait isn't that just ... regular America?"

[00:09:19] <judybot> dale: Doctor Who, a show that started all of this in 1963. Yes, the story of Who is big and epic and that's its central appeal. It could be the story of humanity itself, if you look closely enough. But the reason it worked so well in the 70's, and the reason it's becoming more popular and deeper with each passing decade, is that its central characters are all flawed. The Doctor is literally the title...

[01:28:08] <muradm> which command is that, and which key map?
[01:28:41] <muradm> does evil mode has some other keybinding for that?
[01:31:05] <_73> muradm: C-h k C-y
[01:31:40] <quippy> muradm, evil doesn't have a different keybinding, you can still just use C-y
[01:32:22] <quippy> evil doesn't really seem to affect the minibuffer very much in my experience because it doesn't impose vim-style modes on the minibuffer
[01:32:31] <quippy> so when you're there, you just want to use the Emacs bindings, at least, that's how I do it
[01:33:18] <_73> if you set the variable `evil-want-minibuffer` to t BEFORE you load evil then you get full evil functionality in the minibuffer

[01:38:25] <muradm> evil-want-minibuffer is good also
[01:38:27] <_73> yes I guess but unlike vim mode in bash, (I assume you are talking about readline), you get total vim functionality and extensibility, and you can define new keybindings. For example I couldnt live without `(evil-define-key 'normal minibuffer-local-map "q" 'minibuffer-keyboard-quit)`

[12:49:46] <kevinsjoberg> This might be a stupid question, but here it goes. I'm new to Emacs and I'm currently using use-package for package configuration purposes. I do OCaml development, so I added the Tuareg package. I also want to use ocp-indent (see https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-indent/blob/master/tools/ocp-indent.el).
[12:50:06] <kevinsjoberg> What I'm not fully understanding is the relationship between use-package's :defer mechanism and Emacs autoload.
[12:50:53] <kevinsjoberg> ocp-indent, registers a mode hook for Tuareg. See https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-indent/blob/9e26c0a2699b7076cebc04ece59fb354eb84c11c/tools/ocp-indent.el#L160. And the function is autoloaded. See https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-indent/blob/9e26c0a2699b7076cebc04ece59fb354eb84c11c/tools/ocp-indent.el#L142-L143.

[12:52:25] <kevinsjoberg> I thought I then could do something like (usage-package ocp-indent :defer t). But that didn't work. Removing :defer solved the problem. I could also register the hook myself though (use-package ocp-indent :defer t :hook (tuareg-mode . ocp-setup-indent)) and that works too.

[15:59:05] <corwin> my pleasure!  try C-x C-e on this: (info "(elisp)Pattern-Matching Conditional")
[15:59:57] <corwin> Here is a good place if you get stuck.  Pcase can be pretty offputting to get started with (but is sick once you learn to wield it)
[16:01:17] <hrehf> +1 will read that!
[16:01:46] <corwin> cool!  this blog post looks decent but I haven't read it all yet, just found: https://tech.tonyballantyne.com/emacs/pattern-matching-pcase/
[16:02:58] <corwin> yeah, those examples look useful and might give a quick start of the info i linked doesn't provide enough grist
[16:03:32] <hrehf> yeah, what I've read from the emacs doc seems to give a good overview over the idea, but actual usage was light on examples
[16:04:08] <corwin> the info i linked has one or two but I seem to recall crusing examples online to get the hang of it.  I haven't used it a great deal.
[16:04:33] <hrehf> hmmm, now is there a mapcar-indexed that does (apply func (cons element-index element)) instead?

[20:51:38] <makomo> the radix can either be an integer, or a list/vector/string of elements specifying the alphabet. once the digits are calculated, i want to join them all into a single string and pad them to a specific amount. the padding character has to be the first element of the alphabet, which might be either a string or a char

[20:53:49] <corwin> that's a very fine point

[20:53:57] <makomo> corwin: ooh, that could work i suppose
[20:54:09] <twb> Like whatever shithell thought it was a good idea to use untyped calculus for nil vs. #f
[20:54:14] <twb> *shitheel
[20:54:15] <alphapapa[m]> and, yeah, twb is right, normalizing ahead of time makes for fewer bugs later
[20:54:34] <makomo> twb: i'm aware of that, yeah, but these functions are meant to be utilities used while doing (non-programming-related) things
[20:54:47] <twb> I am *SO SICK* of functions that take like an x, OR a list of xs, because they only thought of variadicity in version 2
[20:54:52] <makomo> so the flexibility is good in this case, even though it might be a little bit of a pain sometimes
[20:55:17] <corwin> but if you do require a "flexable" hander, you can stack assertions around it *before* you "cast" with format.  (if (and (pre1 v) (pred2 v)) (format ..))

[20:58:32] <twb> makomo: yes, you should
[20:58:37] <alphapapa[m]> That would be nice to have in Elisp, but the closest equivalent is cl-check-type, I think.  I suppose it wouldn't be too hard to add a declare form that expands to a cl-check-type, that's a nice idea.
[20:59:17] <corwin> alphapapa[m]: thanks! it could def make sense to use an higher-level function depending on what kind of assertions/predicates one has in mind.
[20:59:51] <alphapapa[m]> However, the CLHS says, "In particular, values assigned to the variables by setq, as well as the initial values of the vars must be of the specified typespec," but I don't know of a way that could be enforced at runtime, other than walking the code and sprinkling cl-check-types everywhere a variable is set, which I think no one would approve of, haha
[21:00:21] <makomo> ok, how about an unrelated question then: how would you design a utility that takes a number and a radix and gives you back a sequence of the number's digits in that radix. the radix could either be an integer, in which case numbers 0-(radix- 1) are used as digits, or a sequence of "things", each of which is a single digit. furthermore, the returned sequence type should be customizable
[21:00:24] <makomo> (list/vector/string)?
[21:00:47] <makomo> numbers 0 through (radix - 1)*
[21:01:04] <alphapapa[m]> corwin: It can also make code clearer by making its intention clear.  i.e. compare (cl-check-type string foo) vs (cl-assert (stringp foo)) or (if (not (stringp foo)) (error ...))
[21:01:13] <makomo> and i suppose instead of "things" i can just say "arbitrary lisp objects" (it sounds kinda crazy, but still :))

[21:05:17] <alphapapa[m]> makomo: Forgive me, again, not a mathemetician... but how can the digits of a number be multiple digits?
[21:05:51] <makomo> alphapapa[m]: they're theoretically not "multiple digits", but it's just that each symbol is a more complex kind of thing which can have its own "structure"
[21:06:18] <makomo> alphapapa[m]: e.g. "hh:mm:ss" notation works like this. each of the things separated by ":" is a digit in base-60, but the digits are represented using multiple characters :)
[21:06:35] <makomo> (in fact they're represented using base-10 numbers, which is quite interesting)
[21:06:38] <alphapapa[m]> I must be missing something.  ISTM that you're just converting between representations of a number, so you should normalize the number to a Lisp number and then format it into the base representation you need
[21:07:00] <makomo> alphapapa[m]: the input to to-radix is always a lisp number already
[21:07:11] <alphapapa[m]> makomo: yeah, those aren't base-60 numbers... and treating them that way will make it very confusing

[21:07:50] <alphapapa[m]> I mean, what's the problem with string-in-base-X->number->string-in-base-Y?
[21:08:12] <makomo> the input to to-radix is already a number, so there's no string-in-base-X -> number at all
[21:08:44] <makomo> the conversion itself is easy, but it's just that i'm not returning back a string, but a sequence of digits (which are the radix' symbols)

[21:09:01] <alphapapa[m]> I still feel like I'm missing something... what's the problem with outputting it as a string?  Why do you need a non-string sequence of numbers representing the base-representation digits?
[21:09:24] *** Quits: licjon (~user@user/licjon) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:10:13] <makomo> because sometimes that's easier to work with, rather than having to think of a string of N characters to represent the symbols. e.g. if i want to represent my number in base 256 (which is essentially a big endian octet encoding of the number), then it's nice to have that feature
[21:10:37] <twb> Sounds like you want bigints

[21:11:02] <twb> Yes those are bigints

[21:11:10] <twb> But the base is not that small
[21:11:17] <makomo> twb: they are, but i don't get your point
[21:11:19] <twb> Usually it's (word size) - 2
[21:11:32] <twb> makomo: my point is if you want bigints just use bigints
[21:12:06] <makomo> but i am using them. this was just a random example. the base might've as well been 500 or something
[21:12:13] <makomo> disregard the fact that it's 2^8
[21:13:08] <twb> fuck me does elisp even have bigints
[21:13:11] <makomo> alphapapa[m]: that's just doing a roundtrip to achieve the same thing, no?
[21:13:15] <makomo> twb: yes since emacs 27 i think?
[21:13:17] <twb> I can't see them in elisp

[21:13:49] <alphapapa[m]>   twb​I can't see them in elisp 
[21:13:49] <alphapapa[m]> To achieve the same thing as what?  I thought that's the output you wanted, a list of numbers, each one representing a digit of the base-converted representation of the original number
[21:13:50] <makomo> i don't think i've been able to find anything
[21:14:55] <makomo> alphapapa[m]: are you referring to elisp's string-to-number? so if the radix is 256, how exactly would i convert my number into a string, so that each character can be used with string-to-number?

[21:18:16] <makomo> right, so finally we're back at: what if i don't want to return just a list, but perhaps a vector, or even a string (if each radix symbol is specified as a single character)
[21:18:36] <alphapapa[m]> Are you asking how to convert a list to a vector?
[21:18:42] <makomo> mostly as a convenience
[21:18:46] <makomo> no, just how to design the api :'D
[21:19:08] <alphapapa[m]> I would design the API this way: Only work on a single type.  Convert anything else to that type before doing anything with it.

[21:26:01] <makomo> alphapapa[m]: the problem is mostly the return type. sometimes i want the digits as a list of numbers, but sometimes it really *is* convenient if i format them as a string instead (usually in the case 2 <= radix <= 36)
[21:26:22] <makomo> alphapapa[m]: and i'd like to avoid having to do (cl-coerce (to-radix ...) 'string) all the time because it's clutter and gets annoying
[21:26:52] <grym> alphapapa[m]: rob pike, i'm pretty sure
[21:27:04] <alphapapa[m]> makomo: I would design your function to always return one type of data, then convert it where you need to.  If you're having to do what feel like too many type conversions, that's probably a sign that the design is wrong overall.
[21:27:10] <makomo> that's why when the radix alphabet is specified as a string, i return a string. if it's a list, i return a list, etc.
[21:27:12] <alphapapa[m]> grym: I'm pretty sure it was Abraham Lincoln, but thanks ;)
[21:28:17] <makomo> alphapapa[m]: in general yes, but in this case "converting it where i need to" gets annoying because these functions are supposed to be little dwim on-the-fly utilities :D
[21:28:22] <alphapapa[m]> Also, I just realized that Elisp has cl-the, which does type checking concisely

[21:29:11] <alphapapa[m]> grym: Yeah, I think that's what I was thinking of, thanks.
[21:29:36] <makomo> alphapapa[m]: not quite because it wouldn't make a lot of sense for to-radix in particular to be a command
[21:30:02] <makomo> (yep, i'm aware of interactive)
[21:30:11] <alphapapa[m]> makomo: You could have the supporting function take a single type and do the math, then have your command handle converting between types
[21:30:28] <alphapapa[m]> trying to do it all in a single function will make it more complicated
[21:31:05] <makomo> yes, but in this case i don't want it as a command but rather as an elisp function that i can use. the workflow is essentially using emacs to quickly transform data, numbers, etc.
