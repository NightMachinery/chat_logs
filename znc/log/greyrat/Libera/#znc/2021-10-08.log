[19:54:07] <BadKarma> hi, so i recently added an ssl cert to ZNC, and now I'm unable to access it. I tried multiple versions, znc -D gives me rc/Csocket.cpp:1851 Bad keyfile ... [/etc/.../privkey.pem]
[19:54:29] <BadKarma> $ openssl rsa -check -noout -in privkey.pem :  RSA key ok
[19:54:49] <BadKarma> I checked permissions and ZNC has access to the cert and key
[19:55:50] <BadKarma> openssl version : OpenSSL 1.1.1d 
[20:01:44] <BtbN> you REALLY need to update that openssl version
[20:01:49] <BtbN> That's horribly insecure
[20:02:15] <BtbN> And what does "file" say about your pem file?
[20:02:21] <BtbN> Is it actually in pem format?
[20:03:06] <BadKarma> wait let me check
[20:05:08] <Khaytsus> BadKarma: Did you check what cert znc wants?  It's specific.
[20:05:10] <BadKarma> hmm..so the pem in letsencrypt/live is a link, which points to ../archieve
[20:05:19] <BadKarma> running file on it gives ASCII text
[20:05:27] <Khaytsus> https://wiki.znc.in/Signed_SSL_certificate
[20:05:28] <BadKarma> not sure why its in ascii tho
[20:05:42] <Khaytsus> All certs are ascii, what are you even saying
[20:05:50] <BadKarma> Khaytsus: I'm using letsencrypt, i followed the guide you just mentioned 
[20:06:03] <BadKarma> This is my first time using certs so...
[20:06:28] <Khaytsus> You're pboably not providing the right files to znc or such, I did that once, it is not an obvious thing
[20:06:41] <BadKarma> I did update the ZNC config with the correct paths 
[20:08:41] <Khaytsus> I just have them all pointed at the same file, and my certbot post hook just does cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/znc.domain/{cert,privkey,fullchain}.pem > /home/path/.znc/znc.pem
[20:08:52] <Khaytsus> but they can be separate files 
[20:09:06] <BtbN> Before anything else, I'd be seriously concerned about that super old OpenSSL version
[20:09:11] <BtbN> it has a load of documented security flaws
[20:09:13] <Khaytsus> heh
[20:09:24] <Khaytsus> Yeah, that openssl is super, super, super old and bad
[20:09:45] <Khaytsus> Actually I suppose it's not that old...  2 years.  Still super bad.
[20:09:53] <BadKarma> BtbN: haha you're right i should upgrade, it's a fresh VM so i hadn't tinkered with it all that much 
[20:10:04] <BtbN> If it has 1.1.1d, it can't be that fresh
[20:10:12] <BtbN> they're at i or something
[20:10:14] <BadKarma> It's a google cloud VM
[20:10:16] <Khaytsus> https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-1.1.1-notes.html ;)
[20:10:21] <BadKarma> that's what they game me :/
[20:10:27] <BadKarma> gave*
[20:10:31] <BtbN> Sounds horrible, look for a better hoster
[20:10:35] <Khaytsus> My google cloud vm is up to date
[20:10:38] <Khaytsus> Not usre what you're using
[20:12:19] <BadKarma> Okay I'll upgrade maybe it's what's causing the issue
[20:12:28] <BadKarma> Khaytsus: here's a snip from my config SSLCertFile = /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain/fullchain.pem / SSLDHParamFile = /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain/fullchain.pem / SSLKeyFile = /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain/privkey.pem /
[20:12:58] <BadKarma> I added / to denote line break
[20:13:25] <BtbN> Why are you trying to use the fullchain as DH params?
[20:13:48] <BadKarma> what should i use then?
[20:13:58] <BtbN> DH params
[20:14:31] <Khaytsus> cert.pem  chain.pem  fullchain.pem  privkey.pem
[20:14:34] <Khaytsus> those are the files certbot outputs
[20:15:12] <BadKarma> Khaytsus: yes that's what i have 
[20:15:28] <Khaytsus> Yeah, just saying there's no "dh" file heh
[20:17:36] <BtbN> It's not even complaining about the DH file though
[20:17:50] <BtbN> My wild guess is that znc simply has no permissions to read the files
[20:18:28] <BadKarma> BtbN: I have created a user for znc to run in, and added it to a group that has the correct permissions to the certificates
[20:18:47] <BtbN> Did you verify that?
[20:20:19] <BadKarma> yes
[20:22:32] <MetaNova> <BtbN> Why are you trying to use the fullchain as DH params? <BadKarma> what should i use then?
[20:22:40] <MetaNova> (earlier) <Khaytsus> https://wiki.znc.in/Signed_SSL_certificate
[20:22:52] <MetaNova> "You should also generate the Diffie–Hellman key exchange parameters [..]"
[20:23:12] <MetaNova> BadKarma: you create the dh param file yourself
[20:23:33] <Khaytsus> But I thought that was only for old-ass znc?
[20:24:16] <BadKarma> MetaNova: and do i need to automate that for each time the cert renews?
[20:24:22] <Khaytsus> certificates have always been black magic for me
[20:24:24] <MetaNova> the dh param can either be its own file specified with SSLDHParamFile
[20:24:26] *** Joins: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c)
[20:24:27] <BadKarma> I have version 1.9.x rn
[20:24:36] <MetaNova> or it can be appended to the very end of znc.pem
[20:24:51] <MetaNova> but feeding SSLDHParamFile the fullchain is neither of these
[20:25:07] <MetaNova> BadKarma: AFAIK you don't need to generate a new DH param file with each cert renewal
[20:25:20] <MetaNova> which you /do/ have to do if you use a single znc.pem
[20:25:35] <MetaNova> ('to do' as in, regenerate)
[20:25:57] <MetaNova> well, I guess you don't have to regenerate it, so long as you append the existing dhparam.pem
[20:26:27] <MetaNova> but still, the fullchain doesn't contain the DH parameters so there's little point to specifying SSLDHParamFile = fullchain.pem
[20:27:17] <Khaytsus> https://paste.centos.org/view/f16ca175  <-- this is all I have..  certbot config'ed to generate stuff of course, but this is what gets those LE files to znc
[20:27:27] <BadKarma> MetaNova: could this be the reason why I keep getting bad key? or is this another issue i should fix as well?
[20:27:41] <MetaNova> BadKarma: it's certainly an uncertainty which you need to sort, first
[20:27:43] <Khaytsus> I wonder why mine works
[20:27:46] <MetaNova> before ruling it out as the cause
[20:28:03] <Khaytsus> Yeah should probably just comment out DH here, guess it's invalid
[20:28:22] <BadKarma> I uncommented it for now
[20:28:23] <MetaNova> that's an option, just don't specify that variable
[20:28:40] <BadKarma> I will upgrade openssl first and foremost 
[20:28:57] <BadKarma> s/uncommented/commented
[20:29:05] <MetaNova> changing more than one thing at a time, fun
[20:29:10] <MetaNova> now you won't know what fixed it ;)
[20:29:10] <Khaytsus> Mine works so I think I'm leaving mine alone :D
[20:29:29] <BadKarma> do i have to manually upgrade openssl from source?
[20:29:33] <Khaytsus> god no
[20:29:43] <Khaytsus> $packagemanger update
[20:29:48] <BadKarma> the openssl i have is the latest one according to aptitude
[20:29:53] <Khaytsus> o_O
[20:30:27] <MetaNova> my Debian instance has 1.1.1k
[20:30:34] <MetaNova> since you mentioned aptitude
[20:30:44] <BadKarma> SMP Debian 4.19.194-3 (2021-07-18) x86_64 GNU/Linux
[20:30:50] <Khaytsus> apt update updates package metadata, apt upgrade updates the pacakges
[20:31:08] <Khaytsus> Perhaps your metadata isn't up to date
[20:31:12] <MetaNova> Linux poltergeist 5.10.0-8-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.46-4 (2021-08-03) x86_64 GNU/Linux
[20:31:15] <BadKarma> Khaytsus: yeah it just doesnt recognise that anything needs upgrading 
[20:31:22] <Khaytsus> alrighty
[20:31:42] <MetaNova> probably still debian 10
[20:32:21] <MetaNova> BadKarma: grep VERSION_ID /etc/os-release
[20:32:22] <Khaytsus> but it's still under support, so shouldn't be running ancient openssl
[20:32:26] <Khaytsus> Unless it's backported 
[20:32:39] <MetaNova> hm
[20:32:48] <BadKarma> VERSION_ID="10"
[20:33:11] <MetaNova> Khaytsus: my one remaining Debian 10 system is 1.1.1d
[20:33:25] <MetaNova> and it apt update;apt upgrade's daily
[20:34:13] <BtbN> That does not sound right
[20:34:42] <MetaNova> feel free to compare with your own debian 10 instance
[20:34:55] <MetaNova> but I just did apt update manually, no new packages
[20:34:59] <BtbN> Debian would not forget to update a critical package like opsnssl for over a yeart

[20:38:27] <BadKarma> soo...patched?
[20:38:34] <BadKarma> can I manually upgrade it MetaNova 
[20:38:37] <MetaNova> bunch of patches
[20:38:55] <BadKarma> or should I just create a new instance, although that would be a lot of work to be honest 
[20:38:57] <MetaNova> BadKarma: I don't see the point in manually updating openssl, just dist-upgrade
[20:39:11] <MetaNova> or redeploy straight to debian 11
[20:39:21] <BadKarma> cool as long as i have the latest patched version I'm good
