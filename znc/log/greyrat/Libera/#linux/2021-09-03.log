[02:08:09] <hassoon> those who live alone in remote rural places
[02:08:11] <Gustavo6046> is there a bash condition for checking if an array is not empty or is that just -n "${MYARRAY[@]}" ?

[02:08:16] <ayecee> i have the bottles only because there's a lot of places with no taps.

[02:08:54] <hassoon> Gustavo6046: check the bash guide book, made by the folks in #bash, it contains everything you need
[02:09:05] <Gustavo6046> so no asking #bash ? :<
[02:09:15] <ayecee> Gustavo6046: there's syntax to return the number of elements in an array, would that do?
[02:09:21] <Gustavo6046> ahhh

[02:09:31] <Gustavo6046> oo, it's [#] I think

[02:09:39] <Gustavo6046> even its manpage
[02:09:40] <hassoon> Gustavo6046: just seek for the syntax you are looking for, in the bash guide book i told you about
[02:09:48] <Gustavo6046> is hard to look for the right sections sometimes
[02:09:54] <Gustavo6046> from just how much stuff there is in bash

[02:10:25] <Gustavo6046> ayecee: true
[02:10:32] <Gustavo6046> i know there's one describing conditionals

[03:38:28] <_xor> It does surprise me that FreeBSD installs & boots but the Debian installer in Proxmox locks up early on.
[03:38:39] <_xor> I wouldn't expect that given the hardware support disparity between the two OSs.
[03:39:24] <_xor> Though now that I think about it, it's also possible that it's locking due to probing hitting something unexpected (since it's potentially looking for more hardware it recognizes).

[07:16:50] <Psi-Jack[m]> I don't have my docking station hooked up to a display... But I could try it, I do have 3 montors afterall, and the docking station, while is not Thunderbolt, is USB-C and has HDMI.

[07:18:25] <SineDeviance> One of the really sweet things about this particular combo is that I also have a Lenovo Legion 5 with USB-C, and although it's officially unsupported, everything except power control on the dock works great

[07:18:43] <SineDeviance> So after work, I can just swap the laptops

[07:22:11] <sublim20> isn't apt depricated for 'rings' or something
[07:22:13] <jackiee> arch is fun. but not optimal for a home server

[07:22:38] <[[R]]> sublim20: what?
[07:22:47] <SineDeviance> jackiee: like I said above - use the netinst option, then when you do the install just pick the base system and (optionally) install SSH if you want to connect remotely
[07:22:47] <jackiee> debian is still my all time goat for reliable server setup
[07:22:53] <SineDeviance> Then reboot, and all you will have is a base system

[07:24:47] <SineDeviance> Psi-Jack[m]: yeah, but for enterprise security patches is all you need
[07:24:56] <SineDeviance> 10 years on the same platform is an attractive spend

[07:25:10] <[[R]]> sublim20: if you say so
[07:25:18] <jackiee> i feel like arch is the perfect sweet spot between what devs do for you vs what they dont. they give you all the tools and things you need to build what you want premade, where as with gentoo you have to fashion your own
[07:25:31] <[[R]]> jackiee: yeah... its perfect at breaking!

[07:33:31] <Psi-Jack[m]> The problem with Ubuntu LTS is... Once released, it's pretty fricken stale.

[07:34:02] <SineDeviance> The current one is like ... 20.04.4 or something
[07:34:03] <Psi-Jack[m]> They do, but it's still pretty stale.
[07:34:13] <SineDeviance> Eh, less stale than debian stable
[07:34:15] <Psi-Jack[m]> Compared to CentOS.
[07:34:20] <SineDeviance> Ubuntu does get more updates than debian, and faster
[07:34:25] <Psi-Jack[m]> No. MORE stale.

[07:34:31] <jackiee> so i would say that any normal person will, sooner or later, find themselves really needing a package that will require AUR, etc./

[07:34:48] <SineDeviance> But ... ubuntu DOES have backports?
[07:34:49] <Psi-Jack[m]> Ubuntu has a small handful of backports,...
[07:35:04] <Psi-Jack[m]> Barely.

[07:36:25] <SineDeviance> Maybe, all I can say is that I am running ubuntu-server on six different VMs right now that do different roles and I haven't used anything in backports

[07:36:41] <Psi-Jack[m]> Things that can definitely be a benefit to maintain updates on as stuff gets integrated.
[07:36:57] <Psi-Jack[m]> Well, Ubuntu backports literally suck.
[07:37:10] <Psi-Jack[m]> Debian backports has thousands of packages Ubuntu barely has 30.
[07:37:11] <Psi-Jack[m]> IF even that many.
[07:37:16] <SineDeviance> I would counter that I bet a lot of stuff in debian backports is in the regular ubuntu repos

[08:21:50] <linux-forever> the acme protocol seems like it would be more elegant than me writing API calls
[08:22:02] <[[R]]> linux-forever: right... and acme is all automated...
[08:22:13] <SineDeviance> linux-forever: why not just use certbot and letsencrypt? It's basically designed to be automated
[08:22:18] <SineDeviance> That way you can cut out the ACME server
[08:22:28] <SineDeviance> all you need is the client on your servers
[08:22:35] <linux-forever> letsencrypt is rubbish inside firewalls
[08:22:49] <linux-forever> the certs only last 90 days (hard and fast rule)

[08:25:19] <theos> re: i am still trying to trim pdf pages with imagemagick with not much luck with a single command. have to extract the images from the pdf first. then 'convert' can trim the images. is there a way to do it in one go? i am trying 'convert -density 200  ca1.pdf[120-121] c1.jpg' adds a border. how do i tell it to not add a border?
[08:25:22] <SineDeviance> but again, your requirements are different
[08:25:27] <linux-forever> matsaman anything that needs a correct cert
[08:26:04] <matsaman> but you can only really quantify "correctness" via trust by getting online
[08:26:20] <matsaman> even if it's irregularly
[08:26:26] <matsaman> even if it's via sneakernet
[08:26:49] <SineDeviance> it doesn't really matter though, there are commercial CAs that support ACME now, so you can either 1. setup one ACME client and pull all your certs, then distribute them another way or 2. setup your own ACME server, manually load your CAs certs, then distribute them to clients
[08:26:52] <linux-forever> we have a CA, pay them a tonne for wildcard certs to use internally, LE isn't needed.. they have an ACME server we can GET the certs from them no problem, I'm looking at then DISTRIBUTING them amongst the requiring machines via an ACME server I make inside the firewall that can act as a proxy

[08:28:21] <linux-forever> simple example - there's no reason the internal confluence wiki server needs to talk out to the real internet, but it still needs a valid cert.

[09:57:55] <mnrmnaugh> you need some []
[09:58:12] <patanga>  rud0lf: you are not a newbie, and brackets are really difficult, they depend also on what kind of shell, posix sh or bash? In any case you can debugger by adding a statement like "echo yes" , put it onto the line and see what happens

[10:00:13] <mnrmnaugh> no wtf
[10:00:19] <patanga> rud0lf: as for the syntax as to lines, ; and so on: look into your .bashrc or somewhere else for examples of "if then" statements
[10:00:20] <rud0lf> printf is command?
[10:00:23] <rud0lf> or echo is keyword?
[10:00:24] <rud0lf> :D
[10:00:33] <mnrmnaugh> good lords
[10:00:34] <patanga> rud0lf: echo is a builtin command into the shell
[10:00:53] <jetchisel> type -a echo printf
[10:01:01] <rud0lf> i thought printf is a keyword
[10:01:02] <mnrmnaugh> bot4 are builtins, ec4o is a poor design

[10:01:16] <rud0lf> but `which printf` shows path
[10:01:39] <patanga> mnrmnaugh: echo is really not that powerful as printf, but not poor. it depends on what you want to use it for

[12:46:34] <kubast2> I always thought it just doesn't exist at all and hence why on windows and linux connecting to a 4k/1080p tv makes the whole screen vissible only to ants. Is it about the screens not implementing it, or the information being hardly accessible, or assumed that some hardware would have said information corrupted in some way.

Most users are more likely to
[13:13:08] <kubast2> know +/- how far from the screen they are going to sit as well, it would of course be a bit much, and then you can make the argument, that this information can't be scaled in an linear fashion, because our eyes have a focal length;

I annotate my PDF's a lot: underlining text, adding comments (as direct text, or as those little balloons that show up after clicking), highlighting, adding basic shapes, etc. I know Okular allows these operations, but i've used it in the past and the annotations do NOT store within the PDF itself. For example, when opening the PDF with acrobat reader on a windows computer, the
[14:14:36] <scaleww> annotations didn't show up (or am I missing something?)

[15:44:24] <fakuve> Limit the transfer rate of `rsync` by using `pv` (I know that rsync has some bandwith parameters but I want to do it this way) , so this will work on a file basis `dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1M count=1000 conv=noerror | pv -L 1M > randomfile3.txt` but on rsync there is more than one file so I need to refer to the process I guess , this is obviously not working `rsync -avz ~/messing/dir01 | pv -L 1M  >

[15:47:19] <waynr> howdy folks, wondering if this is the place to ask about how ARP works in Linux. i'm having trouble with communication between VMs in a cloud environment that involves IP reassignment whenever i "recycle" one of the nodes -- it seems like there is a nonzero possibility of a replacement node coming up with the same IP but a different MAC than the original so when an existing node attempts communicate with it it
[15:47:21] <waynr> fails because it has the wrong MAC in its arp cache
[15:47:34] *** Joins: EriC^^ (~e@178.135.2.41)
[15:47:56] <waynr> the problem seems to be that arp cache entries on all of these nodes end up with a PERMANENT flag attached to them, so they never time out and subsequent ARP packets that should cause the entry to be updated don't

[18:24:02] <fakuve> Hi there , so I'm missing a chapter in here. Basically I have indexed a website using `wget` and `--no-host-directories` issue is that is in `--recursive` mode meaning that It had downloaded all the websites in the same directory (or it looks like that) . So I got many indexes, the `index.html` I had it was not corresponding with the one of the target website , and I got a bunch of
[18:24:04] <fakuve> `index.html?hl=en&tab=8v.html` `index.html?tab=8j.html` . I'm trying to inspect theseones in the browser but inputing the paths such as `file:///downloaded-websites/www.website.com/index.html?tab=8q&pageId=none.html` will display the `file:///downloaded-websites/www.website.com/index.html` modified with the flags ?tab etc...

[20:48:25] <Dagmar> It mostly only cares about bytes
[20:49:00] <jackiee> yea but if there are more binary bits per byte, thus more bytes per character, groups of characters represent different amounts of bits to binary executable. so encoding is just creating variables to smooth that over?

[21:35:49] <jackiee> thanks for the explanation earlier. im a smoothbrain. i knew that that shell,langueages interpret characters as  data input quantitatively  differently for  binary executable. and thus would need appended to produce the desired results with  that standard of interpreting characters data as binary for the computer.  but my smoothbrain was trying to suggest ameliorating the issue with the very thing that

[21:43:25] <uwharrie> and looks like I was mistaken about Lock being generic, looks like it is specific to the force upper case modifier and NumLock is considered mod2

[23:50:42] <Two_Dogs_> give it ten years and your absolute will be off by some order it took ten years to figure out

[23:54:10] <ayecee> it's packaged with virtualbox guest utilities though
[23:54:11] <Two_Dogs_> tikiwiki, i would say 'do you know and trust the zen devs?'

[23:56:36] <cAMP> Sauvin: consider sun: under intense gravity the atomic particles are squeezed closer together, and instead of the electrostatic forces the "strong forces" begin to dominate, atoms break down into hydrogen and fusion begins
[23:56:39] <trbp> tikiwiki: your scratch is arch? why not scratch scratch?
[23:56:57] <Two_Dogs_> tikiwiki, zen may be the best thing in the world, i would say the question comes down to trust, or gut feeling? not much of a answer
[23:57:00] <Sauvin> cAMP, yeah, reading up on that now.
[23:57:02] *** Joins: allorder (allorder@user/allorder)
[23:57:03] <ayecee> cAMP: right but does that change the radius?
[23:57:08] <tikiwiki> its not arch. The link to explaining the different kernels lead to arch.
[23:57:09] <ayecee> of the nucleus
[23:57:20] <Sauvin> Which radius? Wiki says there are *four* ways of looking at it.
[23:57:23] <cAMP> So what are the situations where chmod +x is not necessary for a bash (or similar) script?
[23:57:44] <tikiwiki> I think I'll just go with vanilla and when I'm smarter I'll go with other kernels.
[23:57:48] <ayecee> tikiwiki: smart
[23:57:57] <tikiwiki> Thanks
[23:58:07] <cAMP> - If I do $ bash script.sh it runs fine. If I do $ exec script.sh it complains Permission denied.
[23:58:19] <ayecee> cAMP: i guess if you only ever intend to call it the first way
[23:58:45] <ayecee> or, if it will be sourced by another script
[23:58:57] <cAMP> Also $ ./script.sh says Permission denied
[23:59:05] <ayecee> right
