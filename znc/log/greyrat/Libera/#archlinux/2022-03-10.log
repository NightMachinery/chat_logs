[04:04:50] <lf94> So really pipewire is an excellent pulseaudio replacement...lol
[04:04:56] <thurstylark> indeed

[04:05:05] <lf94> pulse
[04:05:18] <lf94> and pulseeffects?
[04:05:25] <thurstylark> you can use tools built for pulse, but you can use other things as well
[04:05:40] <lf94> easyeffects is the rename?
[04:06:06] <lf94> do you use something else than pavucontrol for pipewire audio control?
[04:07:02] <lf94> does pipewire perform better in terms of audio playback quality?
[04:07:16] <lf94> (less audio under / overflows)
[04:07:27] <lf94> I would presume: no
[04:07:34] <thurstylark> sometimes the pipewire tools are more appropriate depending on what I need access to, but yeah, I usually just grab pavucontrol because it's easy

[09:43:31] <Edu4rdSHL> What

[16:11:48] <CarloWood> So confusing... yesterday, March 9th, just after 23 hours I deleted two files that I still needed. So today, just now (March 10, 13:30), I put them back from backup and did a 'ls -ltr' to see the files with timestamps of March 9 23:22. But I make back ups at 4 AM... and I put back from the backup of March 9, 4:00...
[16:11:55] <CarloWood> I thought: how is this possible?

[16:12:49] <Khorne> Preserving timestamps isn't impossible
[16:13:04] <Khorne> In fact it's probably desirable
[16:13:13] <Khorne> So, depends on how you did your backup and how you restored from it
[16:13:32] <CarloWood> It is; but if they were put back with the current time stamp it would have been March 10, 13:30.  Not yesterday evening.

[17:38:26] <Furai> Hey guys, what is your preference when it comes to terminal emulators? I found a list on arch wiki but it's huge. Till now I've been using gnome-terminal but maybe there are good alternatives to it? Thanks for any help!
[17:39:13] <Khorne> Ask 3 people about their favorite terminal emulator, get 9 answers
[17:39:16] <Gagis> I've been happy enough with gnome terminal to not bother installing alternatives
[17:39:20] <jschpp> ^that
[17:39:20] <mpan> Furai: if a random name from a random person on the internet is enough for you, just get a random name.
[17:39:23] <thursdaylark> I mean... there's no shame in gnome-terminal meeting your needs :P
[17:39:35] <Gagis> tho I've had one of those quake/half life in game terminal style dropdown terminals at some point
[17:40:00] <jschpp> Also if you use tmux/screen/etc the terminal emulator doesn't matter much anyway
[17:40:06] <Gagis> yakuake?. that was cute, but not actually good
[17:40:21] <Khorne> Gagis, i have that as  a scratchpad in my wm

[17:42:48] <Furai> Ok, mostly asked cause I think I had some terminal in the past that had transparency support. I think it was gnome-terminal as well, maybe tweaked by ubuntu, cause now in arch I can't find that transparency option. Not that I need it. Was mostly curious what you guys use.

[21:27:40] <another|> integer? I don't think this word means what you think it does
[21:28:36] <another|> there are filesystems with integrated checksums like btrfs or zfs
[21:29:59] <zenof> .. be of integrity? well I mean the sender's data to be always valid.

[21:31:30] <zenof> and, no I would like to have a more or less filesystem independent solution, that would also work on an ext4 for example
[21:31:54] <Earnest> If you go the way of zfs, in terms of error correction, you need more than one drive (zraid).  zfs running on a single hdd is probably more harmful than just using ext4

[21:43:44] <zenof> oh, okay, then I will have a look at it at some time. but, for now I still have to deal with ext4. basically I would like rsync to archive a file if it's changed in file size or time on sender and to check for integrity by a checksum. but rsync's --checksum option doesn't do what I want, plut it would go re-calculating the checksums on the sender side for every file every time I run it, even if the file hasn't changed.

[22:30:34] <CalimeroTeknik> mpan, I would have the opposite opinion: if the command outputs nothing, nothing is logged; if it outputs something, it was probably not without reason and should be reported, if only to be suppressed explicitly
[22:31:31] <CalimeroTeknik> this is more philosophy of design, but I see complaint after complaint that "nothing happens and nobody knows why", people grepping their entire hard disk in rage for the message they wanted to see
