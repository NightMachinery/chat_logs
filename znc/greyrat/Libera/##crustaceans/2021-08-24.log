[00:25:37] <prussian> too bad ghc can't target armv7l, then I could put my 'Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!' to use.

[00:26:39] <buttsbot> Twitter - NetflixGeeked - what you need to know about COWBOY BEBOP  ðŸš€ based on the beloved 1998 anime ðŸš€ stars John Cho, Mustafa Shakir and Daniella...
[00:26:41] <manicennui> Um.
[00:27:43] <manicennui> Why can't Americans just watch animation
[00:27:44] <manicennui> ?
[00:30:57] <prussian> because cartoons are for kids, duh?
[00:31:20] <dasm> and internet is for pr0n?
[00:31:30] <prussian> how did you know?
[00:31:48] <dasm> i've heard songs about that. they are all over the internet
[00:39:36] <manicennui> Is there any chance this will be anything but disappointing?
[00:40:21] <dasm> manicennui: there is a slight hope.
[00:40:31] <dasm> like with GITS
[00:40:33] * dasm runz
[00:40:36] <manicennui> I get why Hollywood makes bad remakes and such (people will buy tickets based on name recognition), but do bad remakes help sell streaming subscriptions?
[00:41:01] <manicennui> I suppose I know the answer to that.

[00:42:59] <manicennui> Manga always surprises me with the different subjects it covers.
[00:52:36] <gerikson> haha yeah
[00:52:58] <bkero> There are some fun ones.
[00:53:12] <bkero> I've been going through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drops_of_God recently
[00:53:13] <buttsbot> Drops of God - Wikipedia
[00:58:20] <manicennui> Shizuku learns that, in order to take ownership of his legacy, he must correctly identify, and describe in the manner of his late father, thirteen wines, the first twelve known as the "Twelve Apostles" and the thirteenth known as the "Drops of God"
[00:58:24] <manicennui> That does sound interesting.
[00:58:43] <cb> i want to make an evangelion reference
[01:01:19] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moriarty_the_Patriot
[01:01:20] <buttsbot> Moriarty the Patriot - Wikipedia
[01:01:22] <manicennui> That sounds wild.
[01:01:35] <manicennui> "They scheme together to kill Albert's cruel blood related brother, also named William, burn down the family estate, and then start a new life together aimed at using illegal means to destroy the class system which had plagued the country for centuries."
[01:02:36] <manicennui> Is that similar to Moriarty's role in the books?
