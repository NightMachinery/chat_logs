[05:15:00] <JakeSays> what do you use the petg for
[05:15:12] <gufi> same shit i use pla for honestly
[05:15:21] <gufi> i dont like printing petg so i use what i  have for test prints
[05:15:32] <JakeSays> i bought a spool of it
[05:15:44] <gufi> i prefer printing pla or asa honestly
[05:16:01] <JakeSays> printed two parts - one small and one large. the small one printed fine, but the larger one had adhesion issue
[05:16:03] <gufi> asa prints almost like pla but with more heat and an eclosure required
[05:16:14] <gufi> what bed are you using?
[05:16:22] <gufi> i print every thing on the back of a mirror
[05:16:25] <JakeSays> the one that came with the printer
[05:16:30] <JakeSays> oh interesting
[05:16:43] <KNERD> Though that was Chrysler's "Eagle" brand
[05:16:53] <JakeSays> this one has some sort of surface on glass
[05:17:10] <gufi> textured?
[05:17:19] <JakeSays> yeah
[05:17:25] <gufi> yea i wasn't a fan of those
[05:17:42] <JakeSays> it seems to work fine as long as i wipe it with alcohol
[05:17:47] <gufi> i have never had the back of a mirror fail a print as long as its perfectly clean
[05:17:49] <JakeSays> at least for most pla
[05:18:02] <JakeSays> very interesting
[05:18:07] <gufi> never -ever- touch the build surface
[05:18:16] <gufi> oils on your hand are doom  for prints
[05:18:22] <JakeSays> is it a regular mirror?
[05:18:34] <KNERD> you can use a dag of hair spray for glass. Use too much and you will not be able to get the print off without damaging it
[05:18:47] <gufi> yup, 12x12 mirror from home depo, comes in a pack of 3
[05:18:58] <JakeSays> i tried hair spray. didn't do a thing.
[05:19:07] <JakeSays> gufi: i'm definitely going to give it a try.
[05:19:19] <KNERD> try more of it.
[05:19:26] <JakeSays> i did
[05:19:26] <gufi> for PETG on mirror it stick so well that you need to let it cool all the way down, then occasionaly if it still wont come off heat it up to 50c
[05:19:36] <gufi> will pop right off after that

[05:20:29] <gufi> i  should probably get one of those since the 12x12 is a little smaller than my bed size
[05:20:39] <JakeSays> lol just a little
[05:20:47] <gufi> 310x310 mm isn't quite 12x12
[05:21:01] <gufi> super close butyea...
[05:21:14] <JakeSays> oh i thought you had one that was 500x500
[05:21:20] <JakeSays> mine is also 310
[05:21:20] <gufi> hahah nah
[05:21:23] <gufi> i want one that big though

[05:22:11] <MizMahem> While this almost certainly never matters, I wonder why null coalescing operator ends up slower than ==. I think the emitted code should be identical. https://link.medium.com/6iynmCHQukb
[05:22:32] <KNERD> Ender 3 Max is 300x300x340mm
[05:22:37] <JakeSays> MizMahem: because it does a null check
[05:23:16] <JakeSays> MizMahem: you mean equality or comparison?
[05:23:30] <MizMahem> Right but why would it be slower than == null.
[05:24:05] <JakeSays> lol you mean ?? is slower than the equiv. manual c# code
[05:24:16] <JakeSays> which is more than just ==
[05:24:37] <MizMahem> And why would the terinary be slower than if? Those should be exactly equivalent IL I think
[05:24:48] <JakeSays> yeah you would think
[05:24:55] <JakeSays> but then it's a medium article
[05:25:01] <MizMahem> Well, that's what the article says.

[07:33:44] <gufi> could be done with fusion 360 but isnt easy

[07:54:02] <gufi> easy with DI
[07:54:34] <gufi> if you have a scan function to load all of a type
[07:54:40] <JakeSays> gufi: yeah exactly like that
[07:54:43] <gufi> or write one yourself i suppose
[07:54:59] <gufi> JakeSays, yea. that could be modeled pretty close
[07:55:56] <gufi> if you think of the inverse of 3d printing and use filets that would be doable functionally otherwise for the actual bubble style you may need to use blender or something like that
[07:56:13] <gufi> no clue how to use that shit as i cannot even figure out how to model a sphere with that  shit
[07:56:27] <Nasp> gufi:  It's not
[07:56:41] <Nasp> YOu would think you could just register it, but you need to do some other stuff
[07:57:16] <gufi> i've done it multiple times in the past, as long as the DI framwork is what creates the controllers it works
[07:58:16] <gufi> wanna say structuremap or lamar has code that does exactly this in one of the extension libraries that exists for them ( know 100% that it exists for structure map )

[07:58:49] <Nasp> I've tried for days now
[07:59:11] <Nasp> I wanna add tests, but since i can't register the controllers, then i think i just need to skip having proper tests :/
[07:59:33] <gufi> are you trying to load them dynamicaly like plugins or just from another dll in your project
[07:59:51] <gufi> also which frameowrk
[08:00:04] <Nasp> Just trying to load them in when i run a test
[08:00:05] <gufi> its different between core/old mvc/api
[08:00:13] <Nasp> It's aspnetcore
[08:00:24] <Nasp> 2.1
[08:00:55] <Nasp> https://tpodolak.com/blog/2020/06/22/asp-net-core-adding-controllers-directly-integration-tests/ I've tried all this crazy stuff and nothing seems to work
[08:00:56] <gufi> cant you just new it up for a test? or are you trying to do some kinda test hosted http server so you can make http calls locally
[08:01:07] <Nasp> I can get it to return a InternalServerError, but i can't see the actual error
[08:01:19] <Nasp> If i new it up i dont test anything
[08:01:31] <Nasp> I need the entire asp pipeline
[08:02:52] <gufi> in that case wouldnt it be easiest to just do a hosted asp.net server within the tests? i wanna say that should be doiable from the assembly initializer and you should be able to mock stuff there too if need be for say db's... cant say how reliable the tests would be though
[08:03:36] <gufi> backing up: which parts are you planning on testing
[08:04:20] <Nasp> But i am doing a hosted server
[08:04:24] <Nasp> But i can't add controllers
[08:04:28] <gufi> at the office we dont test the controllers because the controllers are just very thin abstractions over an  injected service
[08:05:06] <gufi> so you want to ensure that serialization/etc works
[08:05:46] <Nasp> Yeah stuff like that
[08:05:51] <Nasp> Not the logic but stuff around it
[08:06:07] <gufi> aight uhh... shit... i know we did this a couple offices ago but that was fullfx
[08:06:20] <gufi> this in theory should be easier with core
[08:06:54] <Nasp> Worst part is i just get this internal server error in my test
[08:06:57] <Nasp> If i could just get the reason
[08:06:58] <gufi> this does make me want to get this working now because i have some serialization stuff and routing rules id like to test
[08:07:04] <Nasp> Then maybe that woudld be a hint
[08:07:12] <gufi> tried turning off just my code?
[08:07:29] <Nasp> Hmm think i may just got a break
[08:07:44] <Nasp> Yeah it works, not sure what exactly did it
[08:07:58] <Nasp> I think the "AddApplicationPart"
[08:08:04] <Nasp> Which registers the test assembly
[08:08:17] <Nasp> And then register the controller
[08:08:51] <gufi> gonna save this... may try it tomorrow with some shit i'm doing
[08:09:09] <gufi> i have a controller with 2 actions that technically are identical but have order rules
[08:09:32] <gufi> route/{id:int} vs route/{something:string}
[08:11:50] <JakeSays> hmm. to pixel 6 or not to pixel 6
[08:12:09] <Nasp> I got it working, but this may cause issues later on since it registers the entire assembly
[08:12:19] <Nasp> Need to see if i can figure out to limit it to one controller
[08:12:25] <Nasp> Although could maybe do without
[08:13:17] * gufi so happy he's using .net 5 these days

"-Data"?

[15:18:21] <interop_madness> I would like to have a naming convention where somone can easily see from the class name: "this is a PO"C"O used merely for updating the view"

[16:58:47] <jamea> hi all
[16:59:51] <ScottMichaud> Hello all. Trying to add extra rules to Visual Studio build manager's fast up to date check. When I add an ItemGroup to my csproj with the content <UpToDateCheckOutput Include="C:\Dumps\cvextern.dll" /> then it correctly builds the project if C:\Dumps\cvextern.dll is missing. If I do <UpToDateCheckBuilt Include="C:\Dumps\cvextern.dll" />, however,
[16:59:51] <ScottMichaud> it does not build (unless something else triggered a build, like a csharp file changed.)
[17:00:43] <ScottMichaud> UpToDateCheckOutput is apparently deprecated... but is UpToDateCheckBuilt available for .NET Framework 4.5.1 on Visual Studio 2017?
[17:01:54] <ScottMichaud> Documentation talks about .NET Framework, but it also mixes in a few UpToDateCheckOutput elements... so it might just have evolved in a confusing way. https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/blob/main/docs/up-to-date-check.md

[17:11:41] <biberu> that looks like commands for the printer

[18:08:55] <ScottMichaud> Figured I'd ask before I continue annoying people with offtopic questions lol.
[18:08:58] <jonp> likely as good as any?
[18:09:03] <ScottMichaud> Cool thanks.
[18:09:11] <jonp> i'm familiar with MSBuild.  I've not heard of VS Build Manager.
[18:10:15] <ScottMichaud> Yeah I'm not too sure about it... but it's determining that my project is up-to-date without even running MSBuild. It's a part of Visual Studio that reads a handful of properties from the csproj files, though.
[18:10:32] <ScottMichaud> Learned about it... yesterday I think lol.
[18:12:28] <ScottMichaud> Looks like it's called project system in the dotnet repo: https://github.com/dotnet/project-system

[18:21:07] <ScottMichaud> Also... C:\Dumps\cvextern.dll is not an input file. It's an output file.
[18:21:21] <ScottMichaud> But VS logs it as an input file for some reason.

[21:13:38] <ScottMichaud> 3 months later -- I had a demo... on 32-bit because that stack couldn't handle ARM64.
[21:14:29] <DevJohnC> if you were using it to capture audio it likely had a native code dependency that would have to be compiled per target platform
[21:14:51] <ScottMichaud> Yeah there was a bunch of things that it could have been.
[21:15:12] <ScottMichaud> The developer blamed the open-source networking layer.
[21:15:29] <ScottMichaud> (It was a paid library btw.)
[21:15:36] <DevJohnC> ah
[21:15:55] <MizMahem> hmm... if the interface I am using requires a `Format(string format, object arg)` method, and I also want to hold (and expose) a string that holds and exposes an internal format string, what would I call it? Normally I'd call it just Format, but there is a conflict.
[21:16:10] <ScottMichaud> I don't really blame them though. I know how much software costs. There's only so much you can do when you license a library out for $100.
[21:17:34] <ScottMichaud> But yeah... it's been like that for every single framework that I've used. I don't blame people for wanting to keep their dependencies lean.

[21:42:54] <gufi> not null on array members?
[21:43:00] <bomb> I miss servers. I hate client-side development.
[21:43:06] <gufi> that seems like a thing that shouldnt exist right?
[21:43:23] <bomb> only in Java lol
[21:45:10] <MizMahem> gufi: probably not. I was just considering how behind the scenes this method might be able to tell if a given parameter is has is null or not.
[21:46:11] * gufi cant think of a scenario where that would be usefull generically 
[21:46:54] <MizMahem> specifically `FormattableString`. Everything GetArgument returns is nullable, but I can know from the outside that certain members should never be null.
[21:47:12] <MizMahem> I was just pondering how it might now it might know that from the inside.

[21:52:03] <ScottMichaud> Wow even if you add a custom Post-build step, and set it to run "always", Visual Studio 2017 will still ignore it unless you do DisableFastUpToDateCheck. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51228443/always-run-post-build-event-commands-in-visual-studio-2017 (<--- aligns with my experiences)
[21:52:47] <ScottMichaud> You would think there would be a user-accessible way to conditionally activate that (without creating a new platform or build configuration).
[21:55:25] <ScottMichaud> (And without adding the files to the solution explorer... because I don't want hundreds of test data buffers clogging up that project.)
[22:00:54] <gufi> you're not gonna like the new project format then, it includes everything within the folder
[22:01:36] <gufi> if you need external files to be copied during build i typically just use xcopy or some bat/sh file
[22:02:36] <GunArm> man i'm so mad at webview2
[22:03:00] <GunArm> we just un-released the dotnet core version of my application i spent most of 2020 working on and everything since then
[22:03:32] <gufi> o_O
[22:05:04] <ScottMichaud> gufi - Yeah, that sounds bad. That said, the biggest problem is that this isn't my project.
[22:09:28] <GunArm> we added server side features that require something newer than WebBrowser and switched to WebView2 during the core conversion, but due to a stupid bug in it it seems impossible to read response content when an http redirect happens, which we somehow only just discovered
[22:09:47] <GunArm> and it makes the whole application not viable (not just that new feature)
[22:10:24] <GunArm> and now a gridlock of deciding between bad options to move forward
[22:10:49] <GunArm> and we are back to deploying .net 4.0 version from 2019
[22:11:43] <ScottMichaud> Sorry to hear that. :\

[23:13:42] <MizMahem> no, but I mean it should be straightforward. `using Filestream printer = File.Open("LPT1"); printer.WriteLine("derp");` or something like that.
[23:14:18] <MizMahem> maybe it's more complicated because it's LPT1, might have to call out to some external function to open that, but the basic idea is something like that.

[23:57:01] <MizMahem> `listOfItems.Implode(',');` seems pretty easy to me.
[23:57:51] <Nasp> Well you just didn't exactly short anything down
[23:58:49] <MizMahem> well, it's maybe a little shorter, but mainly I find that pattern easier to use than `string.Join(',', listOfItems)`
[23:59:11] <MizMahem> especially when there may be more transforms that happen to listOfItems first.
[23:59:25] <MizMahem> as in asd's example.
