[13:48:49] <franpoli> Hi there, I'm enjoying using qutebrowser but I am not that proeficient yet. I presume it exists a functionality to copy a link within a page without opening it, how do we achieve this? 
[13:51:35] <ktprograms> franpoli: Use ';y' and select the correct 'hint'. FYI you can just type ';' and see what other hinting keybindings there are.
[13:53:02] <famubu[m]> In pdfjs, when we click on the search button and press keys, qute is not activiating its insert mode for me. When I searched for a word starting with 'd', the tab containing the pdf closed (as d is the shortcut for that). Is there a way to get around that? I'm on qute v2.3.1
[13:54:21] <famubu[m]> Oh, I just had to click once again on the searchbox. And the insert mode activated. Sorry should've checked a bit more...
[14:06:01] <franpoli> ktprograms: Thanks, I got it. This is pretty convenient :-)

[21:25:57] <ninewise> ksp, also occuring with `--temp-basedir`?
[21:26:05] <ninewise> is it often, or on specific sites?
[21:26:32] <ksp> Seems to crash when I search something up, might be on different websites
[21:27:16] <ksp> Also with --temp-basedir it works
[21:27:27] <ksp> Nevermind it locked up my system again
[21:27:36] <ksp> Can't even switch to a tty
[21:28:43] <ninewise> hm afaik qutebrowser should just work on wayland
[21:28:45] <ksp> I think it locks up my entire system, as pinging it fails
[21:28:59] <ninewise> I know people using it as daily browser on wayland at least
[21:29:10] <ksp> So it might actually be locking up the entire system
[21:29:40] <ksp> CPU usage before lockup shows as 7% and memory usage as 2% so it seems those aren't the issue
[21:29:55] <ninewise> maybe send in a crash report?
[21:30:21] <ksp> I've sent one
