[00:40:33] <ljharb> de-facto: there's no such thing as an empty scope
[00:40:42] <ljharb> de-facto: the ability to run untrusted code like you want doesn't exist in JS
[00:40:48] <ljharb> de-facto: a DSL is a domain-specific language, yes

[00:45:40] <ljharb> dpuerto: what kind of component
[00:45:54] <dpuerto> a functional component, like react
[00:46:15] <ljharb> like? or actually
[00:46:34] <PenguinMan98> dpuerto: Have you considered decorators?
[00:46:36] <dpuerto> actually react, but functional export const Alert = () => { switch case default the errors}
[00:46:45] <dpuerto> @PenguinMan98 no I have not
[00:46:45] <ljharb> dpuerto: ok great, altho switch is gross
[00:46:55] <de-facto> ljharb, for example in the CSV i would have time series in columns called hospitalizations and infections that i would load into arrays with index t and then have the user provide some equation (according to new ideas) e.g.  "Math.round(100 * hospitalizations[t] / infections[t-14]) / 100"
[00:46:58] <ljharb> dpuerto: ok so you can just make some of your props required and some not

[00:48:16] <ljharb> PenguinMan98: yes but this is react, react has propTypes, and TS has just "types"
[00:48:26] <PenguinMan98> Fair enough
[00:48:26] <ljharb> dpuerto: how you type-annotate them is TS-specific
[00:48:31] <ljharb> de-facto: ok but why
[00:48:47] <de-facto> to allow them to plot curves according to their ideas
[00:48:47] <ljharb> de-facto: who is this user who knows JS, can type out that equation, but needs you to load the CSV for them inside their browser
[00:49:11] <dpuerto> ok, I am going to use TS, and use type?: "info" | "success" | "error" | "warning" and pass it to the function
[00:49:19] <ljharb> dpuerto: sure. you don't pass types tho.
[00:49:35] <dpuerto> i should rename it then to alertType?:
[00:49:36] <de-facto> a user that can just provide a math function but does not care about details for how to plot it
[00:49:43] <ljharb> de-facto: right but they'd have to know the rules of JS too
[00:49:54] <ljharb> de-facto: if it's just pure math, then `eval` doesn't understand that

[01:56:56] <obimod> for axios people: does adding a syncronous interceptor block the thread?
[01:58:48] <austincheney> obimod, anything synchronous blocks the thread
[01:59:01] *** Quits: codebam (~codebam@user/codebam) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[01:59:27] <obimod> thought it might just apply to the single xhr call
[02:00:12] <austincheney> obimod, if a task leaves the language it should have a callback, promise, or whatever
[02:01:05] *** Joins: hemstock (~hemstock@194.59.250.234)
[02:01:10] <obimod> i'm trying to setup an interceptor that prevents requests which should have header authorization from being sent... seems there is no way to do that with axios interceptors without using { syncronous: true } which is what i think is making things so slow
[02:02:20] <austincheney> obimod, you need to write a small AJAX utility, a single function, that prepares the XHR and rejects anything that doesn't provide specific input criteria.  Then refactor your application to use your new function for all XHR
[02:03:03] <austincheney> then you will want to write an ESLint rule that outlaws any use of XHR or your framework equivalent
[02:03:26] <obimod> that's what i'm using axios interceptors for
[02:03:31] <austincheney> ah

[02:09:18] <cantelope> https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/2494
[02:09:19] <z1haze> the entry object in webpack, can take a key, and an array of file paths
[02:09:20] <cantelope> \o/
[02:09:33] <z1haze> but that results in all those files named the same
[02:09:54] <z1haze> so if you just want to have a scss output by its name, and do not want to have a corresponding same-named js file, webpack generates one on its own. its dumb
[02:09:56] <obimod> is there an entry output name formating method in the config?
[02:10:56] <z1haze> eg if you were to do `entry: { styles: 'path/to/styles.scss' }`, webpack on its own will generate an empty styles.js file
[02:11:22] <z1haze> so the common solution is to just name it `app` and both your js an scss file named app, and voila. but thats dumb i dont want my styles named app
[02:11:48] <z1haze> someone created this for the very reason it seems https://github.com/webdiscus/webpack-remove-empty-scripts
[02:13:09] <obimod> heh, maybe checkout https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#outputfilename and the option about using a function for output?
[02:13:31] <obimod> e.g. you could check if pathData.ext === 'scss'
[02:13:42] <obimod> then return a filename to your liking
[02:13:58] <z1haze> eh
[02:14:24] <z1haze> i just want the file name to be the name of the file :\ i think ill just use this plugin. but what a ridiulous limitation imo
[02:14:59] <obimod> i would try not using these kinds of plugins... they may just be understanding the config
[02:15:13] <obimod> or for another webpack version
[02:15:50] <z1haze> i guess that's with anything though. if the package json says its compatible it will install it
[02:15:55] <obimod> have you tried the output filename method? that sounds like the right approach
[02:16:02] <z1haze> https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/11671 see the comment "how hard can it be to fix this" exactly how i feel
[02:16:10] <obimod> it defaults to using ext === js
[02:16:24] <obimod> but if you exlicitly handle ext === scss, you may achieve what you're looking for
[02:16:46] <z1haze> just see https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/11671 you can see exactly the issue. i dont think you are tracking. changing the file path isnt really what is trying to do

[08:58:16] <cluelessperson_> having to load the image from a local file.

[16:14:02] <powftw> so, i have copied the same fn and renamed the event to "ontouchstart"
[16:14:48] <powftw> it did'nt trigger untill i changed event form "ontouchstart" to "touchstart"
[16:15:19] <powftw> i put a console.log to ensure touch is triggered. and it does. But. the line number and selected text isnt showing
[16:16:02] <powftw> dont the "selection" API actually works with "tocuhstart" or any touchevent as well?

[17:53:07] <stenno> obimod: not cool because you cannot pass any arguments

[21:22:25] <stagas> ah no it works, i just had to delete my package lock also, updating the dep wasn't enough
[21:22:44] <stagas> now it got the latest from the new range
[21:23:03] <obimod> i think installing new packages is a valid reason for deleting package-lock, esp if something breaks
[21:23:08] <stagas> so there's no point in publishing the package-lock
[21:23:27] <obimod> that way deps are jiving more together. package-lock is still good though stags, for security, speed, and continuous integration environments
[21:23:33] <stagas> since it's ignored, it just picks up the versions from the range
[21:23:37] *** Joins: Trieste (T@user/pilgrim)
[21:23:47] <obimod> it makes the installation process more determinate
[21:23:55] <stagas> because it also ruins all the commits, always have to commit 3000 lines of changes
[21:24:10] <obimod> stagas you can use git attributes to solve that problem
[21:24:36] <nep> Well, using npm it works even less than before when importing the library manually
[21:25:00] <stagas> or gitignore since it's not useful to publish package-lock for a library since when you npm install it it will use the dep range
[21:25:04] <obimod> stagas: add a file ".gitattributes" in your repo with the line `package-lock.json -diff` and git will treat the lock like a binary file
[21:25:15] <stagas> from package.json
[21:25:20] <stagas> and not the lockfile
[21:25:31] <obimod> stagas: you want the lock file, just not the diff
[21:25:42] <ljharb> stagas: package-lock can
[21:25:45] <obimod> otherwise your builds are not determinate
[21:25:47] <ljharb> stagas: * can't possible be published
[21:25:50] <ljharb> npm doesn't put it in the tarballs
[21:25:59] <stagas> yeah i wasn't aware
[21:26:11] <ljharb> stagas: and publishing a lockfile would be user-hostile, because it prevents deduping, and updates
[21:26:21] <obimod> ohhh you mean library publishing...
[21:26:25] <ljharb> also personally i think dev-only lockfiles are actively harmful, and disable them on all my projects
[21:26:25] <stagas> so gitignore then, i dont need them in the repo
[21:26:25] <ljharb> yes
[21:26:33] <ljharb> stagas: hold up
[21:26:40] <qswz> why is file remove called fs.unlink?

[22:03:20] <stagas> yes the problem with the JSX types is they are special cased in Typescript, so the only way up until now to distribute them was to include a major types file along with your project
[22:03:47] <ljharb> TS's jsx types suck for react too

[22:10:54] <darkdrgn2k> ahh they are not json they are functions :/
[22:10:57] <ljharb> onosendi: redux is "fine" but it's not necessarily something most people use. graphql often means you don't need it, for example
[22:11:05] <ljharb> stagas: web components are garbage tho
[22:11:06] <stagas> because i very often start with an html file and a script tag, then when it's 200 lines, i want to start moving it to components
[22:11:19] <stagas> but not having to bring in a framework and it's idiocyncracies
[22:11:25] <stagas> just copy paste the actual html
[22:11:44] <Square> i just wish industry got away from javascript and started using proper languages

[22:12:46] <PenguinMan98> Another reason we'll never have AI smarter than us, it would require a programming language good enough to write it.
[22:12:48] <ljharb> Square: JS is a proper language. it's better than most.

[22:13:21] <Square> lol right back
[22:13:31] <ljharb> haskell's type notation is wildly confusing to newcomers
[22:13:44] <ljharb> and "it's fine once you learn it" is not a counter
[22:13:54] <Square> you cannot express shit in javascript. Its as advanced as PHP
[22:13:57] <PenguinMan98> Haskell? they used that lang back in high school
[22:14:13] <ljharb> Square: lol i have no idea what you're talking about
[22:14:31] <ljharb> Square: also php is actually a fine language, there's just more bad parts than most
[22:14:32] <EdFletcher> i don't think Square has any idea of what they're talking about either

[22:15:59] <ljharb> EdFletcher: where's the lie
[22:16:06] <Square> well, each on his own. I bet you can mass produce trivial problem solving in js. Yet another company website or some administration app that needs tons of devs to maintain wo breaking apart
[22:16:09] <PenguinMan98> It's a bad idea to compare a functional language like Ecmascript to object oriented languages.
[22:16:18] <ljharb> Square: not sure what you're claiming here tbh
[22:16:21] <EdFletcher> ljharb: the lie?
[22:16:29] <ljharb> EdFletcher: in what you said
[22:16:40] <nep> han-solo: so you manages to import the library using npm and typescript?
[22:16:41] <ljharb> EdFletcher: it's a thing the youths say

[22:16:51] <han-solo> nep: yep...
[22:16:58] <EdFletcher> ljharb: LOL i guess i just made it clear i'm not a "youth" 😜
[22:17:04] <Square> ljharb, its sad that a language like js has become some sort of industry standard when you cannot express much in it. Its deemed for trivial problems
[22:17:08] <EdFletcher> i have no idea what they say these days hahaha
[22:17:21] <EdFletcher> but that's a good one to learn, thank you! "where's the lie", like it
[22:17:36] <ljharb> Square: except you CAN express much in it
[22:17:42] <han-solo> nep: i have shared the the tsconfig, package.json i used
[22:17:48] <ljharb> Square: so you'll first have to justify your claim that you can't, since *the rest of the world* is capable of doing so
[22:17:53] <nep> han-solo:thanks a lot! where did you put the npm directory, direclty where the sources are?
[22:17:56] <EdFletcher> Square: again, many can express everything just fine. just because _you_ cannot does not make the language bad.
[22:18:09] <ljharb> Square: JS is *deemed* for trivial problems by incompetent engineers. it is not ACTUALLY for trivial problems.
[22:18:11] <Square> ljharb, show me a .js app to impress me. Cause i have seen none
[22:18:18] <EdFletcher> what a troll

So because this is something that happens often, i'm deciding that html is the only thing that is not locking

[23:06:31] <onosendi> ljharb: what's the solution for a named function and `React.forwardRef`? Does the doc's suggestion `const Foo = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {});` suffice?
[23:06:47] <obimod> onosendi: yup
[23:07:38] *** Quits: PenguinMan98 (~PenguinMa@65.153.38.250) (Quit: Client closed)
[23:08:24] <onosendi> obimod: this goes to our conversation that React's functional components shouldn't use `const Foo = () => {}`, `const Foo = React.memo(() => {});`, etc.
[23:08:40] <obimod> forwardRef is a special thing
[23:08:52] <obimod> it returns an instance of React.Component
[23:09:12] <obimod> whereas React.memo returns a memoized value
[23:09:20] <obimod> i think
[23:10:17] <obimod> hmm, yea i never use React.memo, just useMemo
[23:10:51] <obimod> so I'm not sure about that use case you mentioned... but forwardRef doesn't memoize anything by default so you can expect it to act like a normal component
[23:11:57] <ljharb> onosendi: yes, because that's not a component inside forwardRef
[23:11:57] <obimod> or, it doesn't return an instance of React.Component but probably a factored subclass, or something to that flavor
[23:12:01] <ljharb> onosendi: components don't get a `ref` argument.
