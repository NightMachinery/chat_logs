[03:28:07] <hayley> Another problem is that I'd sort of like redefinition on packed structs. (Yes, really.) One option would be to rather have "handles" being a reference to the array + offset measured in structs. In a loop we would optimize out handles, of course.
[03:29:22] <hayley> You have to allocate the damn handles separately, and those are going to be in arbitrary places in memory, but the data can be all contiguous with no header.

[04:34:53] <gilberth> Bugs, bugs, and more bugs. Or just incredible bad documentation. To draw coloured text in Cocoa, you usually create an attributed string with the font to used and a foreground colour attribute as appropriate. The color set in the graphics context is ignored. Works. Do the same to a PDF, or bitmap context, the reverse is true. Not a single hint in the documentation about that.
[04:35:48] <gilberth> But then I don't consider Apple's documentation particular good.
[04:37:34] <gilberth> Still, the colour attribute in that attributed string is just ignored on bitmap and PDF contexts. But I now have a host of macOS versions to test. No fun.

[04:48:40] <gilberth> That was suspicious anyway, as not having a stroke and a fill color isn't very PSish.
[04:52:44] <clothespin> why are lapack routines executing on sbcl on macos when I'm not explicitly loading blas or lapack?
[05:01:28] <edgar-rft> gilberth: when I was new on Mac OS X in the early 2000s the best-selling thing not provided by Apple was "The Missing Manual" (original book title, no joke)
[05:04:51] <gilberth> egdar-rft: Heh. So you suggest I rather find NextStep documentation?
[05:06:44] <edgar-rft> gilberth: if you're looking for Apple documentation, it's best not to look at what Apple provides
[05:07:06] <gilberth> Which wouldn't help because the API in question is post-NextStep. There are a few text APIs to chose from, as well as half a dozen off-screen pixmap classes. I found the one with acceptable performance by experimentation. And note: The best performing off-screen pixmap on iOS is the poorest on macOS and vice versa.

[06:06:50] <gilberth> In particular the whole documentation is very silent about which color space is used. One could only assume sRGB. However, using an 'CGImage' as an off-screen pixmap distorts colors. Again, this is not mentioned.
[06:08:04] <gilberth> So you need to use a 'CGLayer', which on iOS is implemented as a display list and not as a pixmap.
