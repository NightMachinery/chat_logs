[03:50:40] <PersonMcGuy> Hello all, just curious, does anyone know of any libraries to make dealing with UncheckedArrays easier? I know it's pretty low level, so the actions needed generally aren't too involved, but I guess I'm looking for some standardized implementations of basic functionality
[03:52:47] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Easier like with the fill logic from yesterday?

[03:55:26] <PersonMcGuy> Yeah, pretty much. I went through a first sweep of the header file and got everything, but it handles more like C with nim syntax (still dealing with pointers and array lengths). So I'm trying to do a second pass and trying to make it a simple as possible (i.e. turning all those unchecked arrays into seqs when possible)
[03:56:15] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Well the biggest QOL you can do is `type ByteArray = ptr UncheckedArray[uint8]`

[10:59:04] <FromDiscord> <codic> expected behavior? any way to work around that?
[10:59:55] <FromDiscord> <codic> it does print stuff first to be fair
[11:06:17] <FromDiscord> <Rika> That means head closed the pipe before the program expected I believe
[11:06:26] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Or something like that
[11:06:43] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Basically itâ€™s a signal for the sending program that the pipe has closed
[11:12:19] <FromDiscord> <codic> yeah but then I don't want it to sig pipe
[11:12:24] <FromDiscord> <codic> I guess I can register my own handler sure

[22:17:57] <FromDiscord> <jos> does nim ORC invoke finalizer when the refcount hits 0?
[22:18:01] <FromDiscord> <jos> or is it possibly deferred
[22:19:30] <FromDiscord> <jos> "In fact, ORC can be seen as a generational and incremental GC with the additional guarantee that acyclic structures are freed as soon as they become garbage."
[22:19:32] <FromDiscord> <jos> does this mean what i think it means x
[22:20:14] <FromDiscord> <jos> and the { .acyclic } thing enforces at compile time that i won't have cycles?
[22:20:29] <FromDiscord> <jos> ðŸ¤¯
[22:24:31] <FromDiscord> <leorize> no, `{.acyclic.}` means that you let the compiler assume that there is no cycle in your structure
[22:24:44] <FromDiscord> <leorize> it doesn't enforce anything since it can't analyze cycles at compile time
[22:24:59] <FromDiscord> <leorize> (if it can then we wouldn't need orc)
[22:25:32] <FromDiscord> <jos> oh ok

[22:29:22] <FromDiscord> <leorize> orc works perfectly fine with destructors
[22:29:33] <FromDiscord> <leorize> but do remember that top-level variables are not destroyed
[22:30:50] <FromDiscord> <jos> hmm the thing says that only acyclic structures are freed as soon as they become garbage though

[22:31:14] <FromDiscord> <jos> so if i accidentally create a cyclic structure, i'm assuming that means the finalizer will be deferred
[22:31:27] <FromDiscord> <jos> and if i don't have a way to detect that at runtime that's a little scary so i'm just checking in advance

[22:32:47] <FromDiscord> <leorize> the best way to not have a cyclic structure is to not use ref \:p
