[01:10:20] <Hash> I mean, before encryption perhaps it was more used but now
[01:10:28] <Hash> Now encryption is more widely used 
[01:10:51] <Hash> But encryption is about not being able to learn anything from the encypted data
[01:11:06] <Hash> And steganography is hiding things in plain sight.
[01:11:14] <Hash> So camoflauge or concealment
[01:13:09] <Alipha> Hash: there's truecrypt's hidden volume functionality

[01:13:57] <Hash> Stegonographic File Systems to conceal data 
[01:16:10] <Alipha> i would definitely first encrypt what i'm intending on concealing though
[01:16:18] <Hash> Yes, of coruse

[01:17:16] <Alipha> you'd compress the image before encrypting
[01:17:39] <Hash> *nod*
[01:17:50] <Alipha> ... i've thought it would be interesting to create a file system on top of an image directory, hiding the file system data inside the LSB of the images in the directory.

[02:10:23] <rk4> i recall reading in passing the idea that truncating say, sha2 hashes to your desired bit length was inferior to using something with a configurable output length like keccak. iirc one rational given was that while a fixed size output hash might be secure when all [say] 256 bits are used, it's not neccessaily true that all output bits are of equal strength 
[02:11:17] <rk4> is there much to this? i've been truncating the fixed size outputs of hash functions for a long time...
[02:11:21] <ericonr> shouldn't all bits have an "equal" weight, tho?
[02:11:41] <rk4> i'm not sure, i always assumed that
[02:11:57] <Alipha> rk4: sounds like FUD. we often suggest truncating hashes here. in fact, a truncated sha2 hash prevents length extension attacks, heh
[02:12:21] <ericonr> rk4: that's probably not very investigated, but I feel like it should be a property of a good cryptographic hash

[02:15:07] <ericonr> what end do they suggest?
[02:15:48] <Alipha> the only dangers of using a truncated hash are the dangers inherit with using a hash with a shorter bit length
[02:16:29] <Alipha> (unless there has been analysis on specific hash algorithms indicating that the algorithm indeed has "weaker bits")

[18:08:32] <Soni> why does everyone treat this as some sort of joke? https://mobile.twitter.com/SoniEx2/status/1463877689648025603
[18:15:46] <int-e> Bad grammar aside... SMS is asynchronous; you can't expect handshakes to work in this context. This is enough to make it a joke.
[18:16:41] *** Joins: igemnace (~ian@user/igemnace)
[18:17:03] <int-e> You can probably also consider protocol overhead and again make it a joke.
[18:19:13] <Soni> yes you have an MTU of 140
[18:19:34] <Soni> if SMS is asynchronous, then so is IP
[18:20:09] <Soni> and if DTLS is a thing... yes, you can expect handshakes to work in this context
[18:20:22] <Soni> (honestly, what bad grammar?)
[18:20:59] <int-e> No, IP has no analog of a short message service center.
[18:21:20] <MacGyver> I challenge you to complete a DTLS connection on an IP network with the same latency and drop characteristics as SMS -- but that's a bit beside the point, the more immediate thing is that TLS is inherently securing the transport layer, not the application layer. I'd hesitate to call anything secured with TLS "end-to-end encrypted" *even if* it actually runs between the two actual application
[18:21:22] <MacGyver> endpoints.
[18:21:36] <int-e> (which stores and forwards messages once the recipient can be reached)
[18:21:43] <int-e> SMS is more like email really
[18:21:50] <Soni> okay
[18:22:10] <Soni> have you heard of RMS? he might like a word with you about web browsing over email
[18:22:28] <Soni> anyway who cares
[18:22:35] <Soni> SMS isn't even reliable
[18:22:39] <Soni> so it has packet loss too
[18:22:50] <Soni> it's much more similar to IP than it looks
[18:23:25] <iz> tcp/ip != ip
[18:23:37] <MacGyver> It's more similar to a very MTU-constrained ethernet, which IP networks definitely have trouble running over.
[18:23:53] <Soni> MacGyver: eh same difference
[18:23:59] <MacGyver> No, it's not the same difference.
[18:24:07] <Soni> yes, same difference
[18:24:08] <iz> no one is doing TLS over raw IP packets
[18:24:12] <Soni> those are just technicalities
[18:24:21] *** Joins: yeirr (~yeirr@user/yeirr)
[18:24:36] <int-e> But with IP if your recipient isn't online you expect the packet to be lost; so you can assume that if you can transmit a packet successfully at all, you can also complete a handshake. You can't expect that from SMS at all.
[18:24:40] <Soni> so you don't want end-to-end encrypted messaging on your phone
[18:24:56] <Soni> why exactly do you not want end-to-end encrypted messaging on your phone?
[18:24:59] <MacGyver> No, they're not "just technicalities". You have 140 bytes per packet. You need a multiple of that to send even *one* DTLS handshake packet. IP doesn't handle ethernet drops in any way other than resending the entire IP packet.
[18:25:08] <MacGyver> This *will* bite you.
[18:25:46] <int-e> Anyway, "can we make this work in some cases" goes way beyond the question why people treat this idea as a joke.
[18:25:47] <MacGyver> Regardless, my other point remains.
[18:25:49] <int-e> Not interested.
[18:26:02] <Tykling> (it is subtle but I am pretty sure this person is trolling)
[18:26:04] <MacGyver> TLS does not, never has, never will, provide what end-to-end-encryption implies.
[18:26:07] <Soni> y'all are evil anti-E2EE messaging corporate shills?
[18:26:12] <iz> lol @ "just technicalities" as it technically, it won't work
[18:26:37] <iz> just ignore that and let's talk about it more though
[18:26:46] <Soni> is it too much to ask for native E2EE messaging on a phone?
[18:26:51] <MacGyver> If you want to talk E2EE-over-SMS, look at what Signal *used to be*.
[18:27:00] <int-e> except for technicalities (having to do with a few bits in my bank's database) I'd be a billonaire?
[18:27:04] <MacGyver> They had it figured out and then they f*ing stopped >.<
[18:27:33] <int-e> (hopefully more than a few bits)
[18:27:35] <MacGyver> TextSecure-over-SMS was a thing.
[18:27:45] <yawkat> RCS can do e2ee, no?
[18:28:23] <Soni> is it too much to ask for built-in, native, interoperable, decentralized E2EE messaging on a phone, powered by the same PKI that secures websites?
[18:28:32] <int-e> Oh yes, there are certainly feasible ways to get E2EE for SMS, and they look nothing like TLS.
[18:28:37] <MacGyver> yawkat: I think that's a Google-specific extension, not in the core protocol.
[18:29:33] <int-e> anyway, let me meditate over https://xkcd.com/386/ instead
[18:29:48] <Soni> use Ed25519 to make the handshakes smaller
[18:31:11] <Tykling> MacGyver: in what way did Signal have it figured out and then stopped?
[18:33:01] <MacGyver> Tykling: Like I said, back when they were still TextSecure, they were pretty transport-agnostic. There was a brief period where cyanogenmod had built-in TextSecure support for SMS messaging, basically running the TextSecure protocol over SMS rather than over your data connection.
[18:33:46] <MacGyver> And then all that went away because nobody felt like dealing with the limitations of SMS, like only having 140 characters and high latency.
[18:33:57] <Tykling> that sounds awful
[18:34:00] <MacGyver> But it *could* have worked.
[18:34:13] <Tykling> do you even metadata
[18:34:52] <MacGyver> Well sure, but under the assumption I'm handing metadata to *someone*, I somewhat prefer handing it to my regulated phone provider than to random American companies.
[18:35:29] <iz> also there was the thing that phone providers would tend to charge extra for SMSes
[18:35:40] <iz> while having unlimited data plans at the same time
[18:35:40] <MacGyver> Also bear in mind this was back in the very *early* 2010s.
[18:35:41] *** Quits: g00fy78 (~g00fy@user/g00fy) (Quit: The Lounge - https://thelounge.chat)
[18:35:46] <MacGyver> The app and phone landscape looked different.
[18:35:54] <MacGyver> iz: In the US it was actually the other way around.
[18:35:57] <iz> like 5 cents per SMS or some crap like that or like.. 20 per month
[18:36:00] <MacGyver> iz: Unlimited SMS was *very* common.
[18:36:16] <iz> yeah, but limited SMS was also very common
[18:36:16] <MacGyver> Which was the reason stated at some point for using SMS transport.
[18:36:40] <MacGyver> In Europe the situation was reversed -- data plans were cheap, SMS plans were expensive.
[18:36:53] <iz> yeah, i know that was a huge deal in the EU w/ SMS costs
[18:37:44] <iz> in the USA, iirc, the unlimited data plans were about the same cost as unlimited SMS, b/c lots of companies were still charging for SMS, so i guess they thought there was more value there than there was

[21:05:32] *** Quits: r-g (~r-g@163.172.58.132) (Quit: r-g)
[21:13:25] <MacGyver> Soni: That would be just the TCP header (e.g. a bare TCP ACK), which is 40 bytes.

[21:21:17] <Soni> okay, so 140 bytes is enough for TCP
[21:24:57] <MacGyver> Uh, 20 bytes*
[21:25:05] <MacGyver> Sorry, my head doubled it for some reason.
[21:36:55] <Alipha> Soni: i'm not sure if RCS needs internet access. it's something that requires "carrier support", so i thought it was a separate transport, but i could be wrong. does MMS require "internet access"?
[21:38:12] <Soni> Alipha: it does, yes
[21:38:22] <Soni> at least to the carrier
[21:39:10] <Soni> it's basically sending a link and letting the carrier deal with it
[21:43:50] <Soni> so your best bet would be to run TLS/TCP/SMS
[21:44:05] <Soni> with TCP doing most of the work
