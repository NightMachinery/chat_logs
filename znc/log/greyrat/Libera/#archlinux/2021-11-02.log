[03:59:39] <kevr> oh snap, one of the quadros
[03:59:44] <aliendude5300> Can I get a GNOME session without gdm?
[03:59:50] <kevr> aliendude5300: you say when you have nvidia only enabled, it's not
[03:59:58] <kevr> just use tty to start with.
[04:00:19] <kevr> at least then we'll know if you can just get into the kernel and tty with pure nvidia or not.
[04:00:30] <aliendude5300> and then what? Try to run gnome-session? systemctl isolate graphical.target?
[04:00:44] <kevr> my approach right now is to reduce the number of things you're looking at
[04:01:11] <kevr> confirm you can even get into a tty with nvidia, then you know that its probably a DM configuration issue. Keep in mind "probably"
[04:01:14] <rcf> nergar: that would definitely do it. It should go without saying that this debian installation is now toast as well.  
[04:01:18] <aliendude5300> ah. so just see if i get a tty without GDM enabled?

[12:15:54] <EdLin> my desktop's CPU is AMD.
[12:16:01] <Gagis> the upcoming generation might overtake the performance some rumours say, dunno if performance/euro tho
[12:16:07] <EdLin> I just couldn't find an AMD laptop that met my needs.
[12:16:19] <phantomotap> how old is the laptop?
[12:16:22] <EdLin> at least, not in my price range.
[12:16:25] <Gagis> yeah those were very scarce on the market for a long ass time

[12:17:06] <EdLin> phantomotap: it's a 9th generation Intel H processor, was the previous year's model - the tenth gen was practically the same as 9th so I didn't feel like getting the 9i instead

[14:26:08] <excalibur8959> Tom^: The problem is that I got this on ebay for 78 eur for the fun of fixing stuff. That battery is more expensive than the computer itself .. 
[14:26:39] <excalibur8959> Namarrgon: Not really to be fair, what else should I try ? I know that it's also very slow on macOS
[14:26:41] <Tom^> well how did you plan fixing it without ordering new parts that is broken?
[14:27:15] <excalibur8959> Tom^: I was especting that I could at least use it properly without a new battery I guess..
[14:28:21] <Tom^> yeah wont work with most laptops, im not entirerly sure why. but my theory is because they safeguard the HW against all these 300 different wattage chargers there is. if your computer starts using more power then what that aliexpress clone 30W can provide we dont want the laptop to die and get sent of to warranty
[14:28:22] <excalibur8959> or is there anyway I could trick the computer into thinking there's a battery connected ?

[14:28:52] <Namarrgon> switchnode: what does that mean?
[14:29:57] <switchnode> Namarrgon: it has a huge minimum scroll distance, and i can't figure out how to reduce it without also ending up with a tiny maximum scroll distance (so that mouse-wheel scrolling is impossibly slow). every other gtk application i use scrolls pixel by pixel, not in weird quanta.
[14:29:57] <excalibur8959> Tom^: Yeah exactly i want to bypass this in a HW level, like creating a break out board based on the connector of the battery to trick the computer

[17:56:43] <mizux> Hi, few day ago the bazel package was not working as expected and today after an update it seems to work nicely, I can see bazel 4.2.0-2 so it seems the package has been rebuild, my question is where I can found any related issue and when/why it has been rebuilt.

[19:43:40] <nergar> systemd is randomizing my MAC address and I can't quite tell which setting to change.
