[03:01:39] <signofzeta> Like, well enough to make two-thirds of your menu IPAs.
[03:02:00] <AdmiralNines> Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Why is everyone so freaked out over IPAs?
[03:02:14] <signofzeta> That might be true. My local brewery has tons of IPAs, even though many people hate hops.
[03:02:14] <AdmiralNines> I can't get over how many people I talk to who say they don't like beer, mostly because they've only had IPAs.
[03:02:43] <AdmiralNines> I prefer Belgian Dubbel's and Quad's myself.

[03:03:08] <signofzeta> But he does have a double imperial stout, Remedy (10.3%) sometimes aged (Whiskey River, 11.3%).  But he has a Polar Beer Club on Thursdays where you get discounted drafts based on the temperature outdoors -- but you have to drink it outside.
[03:03:11] <AdmiralNines> i like my beers larger too :P
[03:03:14] <sd> 02<Mâ€‹itchy93> Ales and stouts I'm not a personal fan of

[03:03:38] <sd> 02<Mâ€‹itchy93> YES
[03:03:39] <signofzeta> I love IPAs, personally, but I do prefer them as doubles, tripels, and quads.  I like them big and hoppy.
[03:04:29] <signofzeta> If it's 30 degrees (Fahrenheit), it's a $1 off if you drink it outside.  20 degrees, $2 off, 10 degrees, $3 off, etc.  Subtract another dollar if it's actively snowing.  But he does have fire pits.
[03:05:06] <AdmiralNines> Sweet. It was -20F here last week. And snowing. It'd be like free beer at that point :)
[03:05:33] <signofzeta> At that point, the beer might freeze!
[03:05:39] <AdmiralNines> Beer Slushy
[03:05:52] <signofzeta> But talk to your local brewery owner.  If he's sick enough to offer it, some people will drink it.

[03:06:49] <AdmiralNines> Naw, it wouldn't work here in alaska. We have around 20 local breweries and they are always packed, and it's always super cold here so....
[03:08:23] <AdmiralNines> I just brew my own beer now anyway

[03:39:55] <signofzeta> Rule 1: you are allowed to talk about PBC.  Rule 2: it must be under thirty degrees Fahrenheit.  Rule 3: you must drink your beer outdoors.
[03:41:08] <Kiernian> what's PBC?
[03:41:23] <signofzeta> Polar Beer Club
[03:41:46] <signofzeta> The outdoor gathering of mug club members at Housatonic River Brewing who get discounts based on the winter weather.
[03:41:56] <Kiernian> okay, making more sense. the beer must be under 30 degrees farenheit or the outdoor temperature must be?
[03:42:04] <Kiernian> or both?
[03:42:23] <AdmiralNines> You can't store beer that cold, brah
[03:42:29] <AdmiralNines> it'd be beer slushy.
[03:42:44] <signofzeta> The outdoor temp.  It's basically $1 off every ten degrees once you get to freezing temperatures.
[03:42:45] <Kiernian> yeah...you CAN, it's just illegal in some states. freeze distillation or some crap
[03:42:51] * DrGibby farts gibbyfarts.com
[03:43:17] <signofzeta> There are fire pits, but if you want cheap beer, you have to drink it outside in the cold.  The owner is almost always out there too.
[03:44:24] <Kiernian> okay, so basically a minnesota above-0 barbecue
[03:44:26] <Kiernian> fun times
[03:44:30] <AdmiralNines> If you STORE beer at freezing temperatures it either comes out as slushy from your keg (if it comes out at all) or it blows the top off of the beer bottle (or explodes the can). No, you can't STORE beer at below freezing. You can distill it it that way, but you use an open canister that won't bust.
[03:44:38] <Kiernian> "it's above 0, fire up the grill and get out the beer!"
[03:45:18] <AdmiralNines> also, it's just straight up wrong to drink beer at anything colder than 45 degrees F in my opinion.
[03:45:30] <signofzeta> yeah, but it's Connecticut (USA).  It's usually below freezing in the winter, though a few years ago, we got to -20 Fahrenheit and boy was my car loud until the oil liquefied. :-)
[03:46:21] <AdmiralNines> It's like 30F outside right now here and we've got weather advisories because it's too hot.
[03:46:35] <AdmiralNines> It's a friggin heat wave!
[03:47:03] <signofzeta> Wow, it's 24F here, but I'm still walking to the laundry room in a T-shirt.

[03:49:27] <AdmiralNines> On a slightly more on-topic note: I've got two virtual servers running server 2019 that won't update.

[04:36:56] <xe0n> no its not!
[04:37:03] <xe0n> he said it's applying updates and then rolling them back...
[04:37:11] <xe0n> which means its downloading files fine...
[04:37:26] <Kiernian> failed to find update with global id...?
[04:37:31] <xe0n> if he's missed an update that includes an ssu, that will most likely be it...
[04:37:34] <xe0n> yes, it saying that locally...
[04:37:43] <xe0n> meaning its missing a prereq update
[04:38:03] <AdmiralNines> hm.
[04:38:22] <Kiernian> yeah, I guess if it's getting some but not all, you're probably right.
[04:38:49] <Kiernian> unless it's pulling from disparate sources simultaneously and not every wsus source has every update
[04:39:38] <Kiernian> whatever, ignore me, I'm going to go do something fun before work
[04:39:51] <AdmiralNines> every now and then an update says it failed to download and it has to try again. So it's possible that you are both right. If it's getting firewalled SOME of the time, and it's blocking the ONE prereq I need, then it'd be acting like this, yes/no?
[04:40:03] <xe0n> its not that, thats an ssu problem
[04:40:13] <xe0n> if it doesn't have the latest service stacks, it can't download the files

[08:20:48] <a1> !flyfacts
[08:20:48] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies defecateâ€¦ a lot! And they arenâ€™t too worried about where they do it either! As you know, house flies like to live off a liquid diet. Because of this, their digestive system can move quite quickly, which means they defecate often. It is speculated that house flies defecate every time they land, even if itâ€™s on their next meal!
[08:24:35] *** Joins: aceryz (~aceryz@89-72-149-143.dynamic.chello.pl)
[08:25:27] <a1> !flyfacts
[08:25:27] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: On average, the life cycle of a house fly only lasts for around 30 days, which means they donâ€™t live for long at all.However, in their short lifetime, they manage to accomplish quite a lot. House flies can lay up to 500 eggs in their lifetime which are usually in batches of around 75 to 150. So, although they donâ€™t live long, an infestation can quickly arise through new generations.
[08:25:37] <a1> !flyfacts
[08:25:37] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Like butterflies, flies can taste food using their feet! This is all down to taste receptors (chemonsensilla) being located on their lower legs and feet. When a fly lands on a tasty meal, which can be anything from animal feces to your lunch, they will often wander around to give their next meal a good taste before consuming it.
[08:25:40] <a1> !flyfacts
[08:25:40] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Thats right, house flies can see behind them and itâ€™s all to do with their amazing eyes! Unlike human beings, house flies have compound eyes. These intricate eyes provided them with nearly a 360-degree field of view, which allows them to see behind themselves. Unlike ours, the eyes of a house fly dont move. Being able to see in all directions allows them to navigate while also being on the lookout for danger.

[23:51:20] <sd> 08<câ€‹ritamine> Even looked closely at each termination to make sure the contact was sticking out
[23:51:24] <sd> 08<câ€‹ritamine> weird
[23:51:32] <sd> 08<câ€‹ritamine> How many of these have you done in your life?
[23:51:43] <sd> 08<câ€‹ritamine> I've done hundreds and only ONCE have I had a bad patch port
[23:51:45] <sd> 12<dâ€‹T0v> First one ðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ
[23:51:50] <sd> 08<câ€‹ritamine> It's a possibility but highly unlikely
[23:51:53] <sd> 08<câ€‹ritamine> Ah
[23:52:48] <sd> 12<dâ€‹T0v> Iâ€™ve had the equipment for about a week now and Iâ€™ve been doing some research on how to wire it up. Kind of a drag itâ€™s not working.
[23:53:34] <sd> 08<câ€‹ritamine> I see multiple terminations on that patch panel
[23:53:40] <sd> 08<câ€‹ritamine> Are all of those not working either?
[23:56:09] <sd> 08<câ€‹ritamine> Also how many rj45 terminations have you done? Those are tricky. Would practice nailing that down by trying to make your own cables of varying length
[23:56:18] <sd> 08<câ€‹ritamine> Checking if they work ofc
[23:57:13] <sd> 08<câ€‹ritamine> Pair testers are 50$ at homedepot if you really start pulling your hair out haha
[23:57:25] <sd> 08<câ€‹ritamine> They show you which strands, if any are wrong
[23:58:00] <sd> 08<câ€‹ritamine> GL
