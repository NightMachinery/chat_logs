[03:36:50] <scara> Does html spec exist like an RFC for irc? Also any good linters for linux cli?
[03:37:08] <scara> html 4.1*** idc about html 5
[03:40:29] <nbjoerg> html 4.1 has a dtd
[03:40:44] <nbjoerg> https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/
[03:40:55] <nbjoerg> html5 is ...more flexible
[03:51:50] <scara> How does dtd work?
[03:58:24] <nbjoerg> it's part of SGML and XML, it essentially describes valid html documents
[03:58:52] <nbjoerg> but but all that said, doing it for html5 is involved
[03:58:59] <nbjoerg> there are some online and offline services for that purpose

[20:29:01] <Northwoods> Hi , is there a channel for front-end ?
[20:36:02] <stenno> there is ##frontend which is mostly offtopic though
[20:36:05] <stenno> maybe #design ?
[20:36:18] <stenno> do you have any specific questions?
[20:36:33] <stenno> #css is also usually related
[20:40:49] <Northwoods> stenno, thanks mate
[20:41:16] <Northwoods> stenno , i am looking out for something ( tool ) which could speed up forms and basic html stuff
[20:41:27] <stenno> i assume this is about page design?
[20:41:32] <stenno> not sure what you mean with 'speed up'
[20:41:45] <stenno> like, a templating language? or a haiku language like haml?
[20:42:05] <Northwoods> for example i need a html/css for a an invoice details
[20:42:14] <stenno> oh
[20:42:36] <Northwoods> usually i look out for it on codepen , or bootsnip
[20:43:22] <Northwoods> stenno, actually even tahts not my quesiton , i need the html input fields to be linked to backend ( after POST ) 
[20:44:01] <stenno> that would depend purely on your backend, and the channel related to your backend would be the place to ask
[20:44:30] <Northwoods> sure
[20:44:37] <Northwoods> Thanks though
