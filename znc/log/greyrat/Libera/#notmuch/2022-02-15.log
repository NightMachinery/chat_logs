[11:26:16] <gauteh[m]> Does the new notmuch bindings ship libnotmuch? or does it also need libnotmuch at runtime?
[11:28:15] <gauteh[m]> It is also necessary to run make, which makes it a bit more complicated to build + install the bindings using regular python tooling. It seems that it is not enough to just have libnotmuch + libnotmuch-dev installed. You need to check out the entire source-tree and build the bindings there.

[15:16:35] <bremner> It needs libnotmuch at runtime
[15:16:43] <bremner> gauteh[m]: ^
[15:24:53] <bremner> I don't think it needs make, but it does need a c compiler. Building outside the notmuch build process is not really supported, but I guess it should technically be possible
[15:29:55] <bremner> You might have to fake the contents of _notmuch_config.py
[15:30:20] <gour> anyone has some example to share with message-templ using multiple templates?
[15:38:57] <bremner> gour: you mean applying multiple templates to one message, or just selecting between them?
[15:40:06] *** Joins: nlhowell1 (~nlhowell@172.58.84.148)
[15:40:08] <gour> bremner: the latter
[15:42:18] <bremner> Oh I guess you don't mean interactively? Because the example the ships with it does that.
[15:45:06] <bremner> I guess the trick for that is to use message-templ-config-alist, but I don't have an example handy
[15:49:54] <gour> well, mu43 has handy mechanism to define different identities by using "contexts", so it would be nice to have something similar in notmuch
[15:51:19] <bremner> what determines the context?
[15:57:19] <gour> bremner: here is the example: https://paste.debian.net/1230955/
[16:01:23] <bremner> ah, I see. I don't think message-templ has access to the same information, it can only make decisions based on the contents of the message composition buffer.
[16:02:50] <bremner> although, if you don't mind selecting a template per messge, it can run arbitrary elisp code at that point
[16:14:57] <gour> i don't mind selecting it per messsage, although it would be nice to be able to define a 'default' one which is used most of the time
[16:20:52] <gour> something like gnus' psoting styles would also be handy...
[16:23:18] <angry_vincent> huh, wasn't able to wrap my head around lieer
[16:25:28] <bremner> gour: did you look at gnus-alias?
[17:07:19] <gour> bremner: i did, but something does not work well, have to investigate more...otoh, the guy behind it doesn ot use notmuch - https://github.com/hexmode/gnus-alias/issues/4 :sad:
[17:13:25] <gour> maybe i should just take advantage of my old gnus setup using posting-styles
