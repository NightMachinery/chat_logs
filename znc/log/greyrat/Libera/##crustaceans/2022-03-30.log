[17:26:15] <edk> i really wish there were lots of countries that just fully legalised weed and were really easy to move to
[17:26:23] <edk> all the weed smokers could move there and i'd stay here
[17:30:04] <river> can we do this for tobacco smokers *ducks*
[17:38:07] <gwozniak> I hate weed. I think it smells terrible and I have no interest in it. I'd be up for trying an edible, but smoking it is just disgusting. That said, I am in favour of lax weed/drug laws in general. I also agree with edk's suggestion of a weed country
[17:38:43] <gwozniak> Cured tobacco is one of the best smells on this planet.  Cigarette smoke is not.
[17:42:46] <gerikson> yah it's weird
[17:43:08] <gerikson> gwozniak: tbf to ole Drew he wants more variety in weed in NL, not just smokin'
[17:43:49] <gwozniak> I'm not commenting on ddv's take. Just stating my position on weed :)
[17:44:40] <gwozniak> Really, the decriminalization of it here is probably good overall
[17:45:08] <companion_cube> wow, the guy moved to NL a few months ago and he's already criticizing them? :D
[17:45:50] <edk> i mean you don't need to think a country is perfect in every way to move there
[17:46:37] <edk> i think decriminalization of weed is a good thing, if nothing else because drug enforcement is well known to be mainly about racism
[17:46:54] <companion_cube> no, but publicly criticizing it, heh
[17:46:58] <edk> i just wish people didn't have to smoke it near me
[17:47:07] <companion_cube> agreed
[17:47:14] <companion_cube> now I'm curious about edibles tho
[17:48:36] <gwozniak> edk: same.  I really dislike the smell
[17:51:05] <gwozniak> I hung out with a lot of casual-ish drug users in high school and yet, never took any
[17:52:38] <gwozniak> Acid, mushrooms, marijuana, and probably other stuff.  Not counting alcohol, which was consumed in copious quantities by all

[18:13:47] <gwozniak> My team at work has been interviewing people for the last week.  So far no one has clearly identified that returning a pointer to stack memory is a bad thing in C
[18:13:56] <wrl> bruh
[18:14:11] <gwozniak> The majority didn't even know what "the stack" was
[18:15:00] <gwozniak> The example I give for the stack pointer is very simple.  No attempt is made to hide it.
[18:15:19] <river> yeah seconding 'bruh'
[18:15:41] <gwozniak> And all candidates have said they have experience with C, and have shown us C code they wrote
[18:15:49] <river> fucking pointers, how do they work
[18:16:14] <edk> can you share the example?
[18:16:30] <gwozniak> These are all candidates who just finished a university degree, and in some cases have work experience
[18:16:31] <river> return &local; probably lol
[18:16:46] <edk> it's odd, i've never met any of these people who can't code
[18:16:53] <edk> teaching of C does tend to be remarkably bad
[18:16:58] <river> do you do hiring tho?
[18:17:06] <edk> not right now, but i have
[18:18:03] <gwozniak> this is the one function I show, formatted better with a comment and all that: char *combine(char *s, char *t) { char r[100]; int y = strlen(s); strcpy(r, s); strcpy(r + y, t); return(r); }
[18:18:23] <gwozniak> I ask them to code review it
[18:19:12] <edk> that seems like it should be pretty simple
[18:19:20] <companion_cube> the compiler would emit a warning, right?
[18:19:26] <edk> many compilers do
[18:19:45] <edk> or at least many compilers can warn about that kind of mistake, i don't know if they warn about this exact function obviously
[18:19:47] <gwozniak> modern ones will, yes
[18:22:20] <edk> finding a better place to put r aside, i hope they ask why you wouldn't use snprintf here
[18:23:08] <gwozniak> The key thing we're looking for is if they know that you can't return r.  How they would fix it is less important.
[18:23:20] <gwozniak> Also, the potential buffer overrun
[18:24:41] <edk> i mean it's also a potential OOB read if s and t are invalid pointers, it's just about documenting preconditions imo
[18:25:07] <gwozniak> If the code were for a desktop/server application, then snprintf is fine. In some embedded apps, it should be avoided.
[18:25:58] <gwozniak> But all that is the discussion part if they note that returning a pointer to stack space is bad.  None of the candidates so far have caught it
[18:26:49] <gwozniak> I have spent almost all the time I have with that question asking questions of the candidate to lead them to understanding what stack memory is
[18:27:13] <gwozniak> A couple of them caught on and understood.  They had just never heard of it before
[18:28:08] <gwozniak> None of them really seemed to know that r was a pointer, either
[18:29:12] <edk> well it's only a pointer sometimes
[18:29:37] <edk> i have the opposite problem, loads of people don't realise that there is any difference between an array name and a pointer
[18:29:57] <edk> (so they think sizeof p can tell them the size of the array p points into)
[18:31:06] <river> wow whoever is teaching people C is failing them
[18:31:44] <gwozniak> One candidate kept calling C code "scripts", which I found internally amusing
[18:31:49] <companion_cube> wait, but in this case it should work, edk, no?
[18:32:03] <companion_cube> it's char[100]? the size is known?
[18:32:15] <edk> i mean it will work here because r is not a pointer
[18:32:34] <companion_cube> :p
[18:32:42] <companion_cube> both a pointer and not a pointer
[18:32:43] <edk> there is a reason i used a different letter
[18:32:44] <companion_cube> since you can do r+y
[18:32:49] <edk> well no it's just not a pointer
[18:32:57] <companion_cube> what a shitty language
[18:33:18] <edk> i'm glad you have opinions
[18:36:57] <river> char r[4]; fixed. now you can return the whole thing as a value :)
[18:37:21] <river> return *(long long)(void *)r; or something
[18:37:25] <river> long long*
[18:37:41] <river> this is what you were looking for right, interviewer?
[18:37:50] <gwozniak> Assuming (long long) is as long as you think it is
[18:37:58] <river> yes of course
[18:38:26] <gwozniak> It might only be 32 bits on our 8-bit platforms
[18:38:51] <gwozniak> Pretty sure it's 64 bits on the 32-bit platforms
[18:39:02] <gwozniak> Not sure what it is on the 16-bit platforms
[18:39:59] <companion_cube> edk: the lack of arrays in C is really sad, sorry
[18:40:04] <companion_cube> strlen() is a tragedy
[18:40:27] <companion_cube> it's not by chance that all the wannabee C replacements agree on one thing: arrays and slices :D
[18:41:23] <wrl> yeah slices are great
[18:41:25] <wrl> fantastic, even
[18:41:53] <river> you wouldn't need them as part of the lang if you just had generics.. you could add them as a library
[18:41:54] <gwozniak> Another question for those here: would you expect someone who has programmed in Python at the undergraduate level to have seen list/dict comprehensions?
[18:41:59] <edk> the lack of size information in pointers is sad, yes
[18:42:08] <gwozniak> wrl: slices are wonderful
[18:42:26] <companion_cube> gwozniak: list comprehensions, yes
[18:42:30] <companion_cube> dict, maybe not
[18:42:48] <edk> it's just not very welcome as a talking point being parroted by lots of people who really don't like C but obviously don't know it well enough to recognise the features they're complaining about
[18:45:00] <edk> strlen i think is a bit less sad than the general case. C treats strings a bit like other languages treat other recursive datastructures
[18:45:37] <river> strlen is fundamentally broken though
[18:45:40] <river> sry
[18:45:41] <river> strcpy
[18:45:54] <river> strlen is.... risky but you can pull it off
[18:46:16] <edk> strlen and strcpy are both possible to use safely
[18:46:32] <edk> with strlen all you have to do is pass it a string, with strcpy you also have to know that there's room in the destination
[18:46:45] <river> you make it sound so easy
[18:46:55] <river> i have a feeling that even after knowing this people get it wrong sometimes
[18:46:57] <edk> that's because it is
[18:47:09] <edk> the problem with C is not that following all the rules is particularly hard
[18:47:23] <edk> it's just that humans make mistakes and the compiler isn't there to catch them
[18:47:36] <edk> which, for the avoidance of doubt, i do agree is a very bad thing
[18:51:17] <gwozniak> neither strlen nor strcpy are fundamentally broken.  They do require more care to use than the name lets on, though.  Equating "char *" with "string" is part of the problem
[18:51:27] <gwozniak> gets is fundamentally broken
[18:52:34] <gwozniak> As edk said, the rules around all this doesn't forgive it, though.  It's really annoying to work in because all the checks are easy to bypass
[18:54:56] <companion_cube> edk: I think that strlen being linear is just bad
[18:55:43] <edk> it is also linear in haskell
[18:56:58] <companion_cube> haskell strings are ridiculously bad, but everyone uses some flavor of bytestrings afaik
[18:57:34] <edk> for things where it matters, yeah
[18:58:52] <companion_cube> same goes with erlang, actually
[18:59:09] <companion_cube> but I think the elixir devs realized that lists-as-strings are bad, and use blobs instead
[18:59:09] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏

[19:43:59] <gwozniak> Got a customer "bug" where they are using inline asm and saying the results are suboptimal.  The suboptimality is almost certainly a result of using inline asm
[20:22:11] <Brekkjern> "I'm doing things that are suboptimal and it's suboptimal! Help!"
[20:26:09] <epilys> ngoldbaum, there's "flag"
[20:27:27] <gwozniak> It appears to be a little known fact that the compiler doesn't understand inline assembly
[20:29:16] <gwozniak> Which is why the extended form has such an insane syntax
[20:32:32] <kline> that is pretty funny, actually
[20:46:38] <gwozniak> It seems silly, but its a reasonable design choice because compilers would then have to be able to parse assembly
[20:48:40] <gwozniak> The simple inline assembly is pure murder to the compiler because if you are managing registers manually, the compiler can easily generate something that won't work with it
[20:48:54] <gwozniak> Since it has no idea what registers you are using

[21:29:23] <gwozniak> I just really like looking at stuff, I guess
[21:49:08] <gwozniak> Speaking of which, I am hoping that there is a clear night predicted some time in the near future...
[22:47:48] <ngoldbaum> sitting at an ancient sun workstation running a custom CDE gui that controls the telescope would certainly be very accurate to professional astronomy setups
[22:49:09] <gwozniak> I don't doubt that
[22:49:34] <gwozniak> If you want to take good pictures with a telescope at home, you basically aren't going to be looking through it at anything
