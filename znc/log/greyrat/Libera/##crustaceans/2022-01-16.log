[05:31:09] <imode> what does that even mean.
[05:31:32] <imode> "The noun markup is derived from the traditional publishing practice called "marking up" a manuscript,[4] which involves adding handwritten annotations in the form of conventional symbolic printer's instructions — in the margins and the text of a paper or a printed manuscript. "

[21:53:18] <buttsbot> Jodorowsky’s “Dune” Bible Bought By TheSpiceDAO
[21:53:20] <imode> that's kind of the second point.
[21:53:32] <manicennui> The winning bid was $2.9 million, placed by Soban Saqib, a 25-year-old cryptocurrency nerd, NFT collector, and freshly minted millionaire from Woodland, California.
[21:53:40] <manicennui> “This is pretty much my entire liquid net worth,” said Saqib, who goes by “Soby,” soon after the auction. “But I fronted the $3 million knowing that the community has my back.”
[21:53:51] <manicennui> imode: It's kind of the only point. Who cares which rich asshole owns it?
[21:54:08] <imode> someone get his home address so we can decapitate him and eat him.
[21:55:09] <manicennui> It seems this guy bought it first and now they have it I guess.
[21:55:19] <imode> lmao.
[21:55:56] <imode> so I'll say again, do we have the contents of this particular artifact preserved somewhere.
[21:56:02] <manicennui> Which probably means this guy actually still has it physically.
[21:56:41] <imode> if we don't, then someone needs to seize this from this dude, scan it, then hand it back.
[21:57:04] <manicennui> There are other copies, and parts of it have been reproduced in other publications.
[21:57:16] <imode> cool.
[21:58:34] <manicennui> Also a documentary about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0cJNR8HEw0
[21:58:34] <buttsbot> Jodorowsky's Dune | Official Trailer HD (2014) - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0cJNR8HEw0
[22:00:19] <manicennui> I'm kind of wondering whether these people have watched Jodorowsky's other work. It's not at all mainstream.
[22:00:52] <manicennui> His Dune would have been weirder than Lynch's.
[22:10:05] <Church> Totally
[22:10:09] <Church> It would've been awesome
[22:10:19] <manicennui> Do you think his other movies are awesome?
[22:12:23] <manicennui> So it seems that these idiots don't plan to do anything Dune related, but they seem to believe that buying this books gives them the rights to the art and such.
[22:12:27] <manicennui> How are people this dumb?
[22:12:40] <Church> manicennui: I do actually
[22:13:59] <manicennui> Trying to figure out their thinking because this asshole won't shut up about NFTs and decentralizing the government.

[22:24:07] <manicennui> JFT
[22:24:08] <manicennui> JFC
[22:24:14] <manicennui> This guy has some really delusional ideas.
[22:24:25] <manicennui> He seems to believe that collecting shit is somehow key to culture.
[22:24:43] <manicennui> And rich people suck because Warren Buffet lives in Nebraska instead of a mega yacht.
[22:25:36] <imode> jesus fucking tits
[22:25:38] <manicennui> It's kind of telling that not a single person involved in this nonsense comes across as smart.
[22:25:55] <manicennui> They all have rich guy syndrome.
[22:26:09] <manicennui> "I made a bunch of money, therefore I know what I'm talking about on a range of topics."
[22:26:57] <imode> decapitate them and redistribute their wealth.
[22:27:35] <manicennui> I'd be fine with a less violent solution, like 100% tax above a certain point.
[22:27:45] <manicennui> I'm only into decapitating the ones who do evil shit.
[22:29:15] <manicennui> And the rich people who everyone focuses on are not in the same league.
[22:29:58] <manicennui> I'm talking like the execs of defense contractors getting involved in politics to bribe politicians to create more reasons to use their products.
[22:30:14] <manicennui> And the execs of chemical companies overseeing the creation of future superfund sites.
[22:30:59] <manicennui> And Elizabeth Holmes and everyone else at the company who knowingly performed sham tests that affected people's lives.
[22:31:34] <manicennui> In January 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sent a letter to Theranos based on an inspection of its Newark, California lab in 2015, reporting that the facility caused "immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety" due to a test to determine the correct dose of the blood-thinning drug warfarin.[60][61] In 2016, Walgreens and Capital BlueCross announced a suspension of Theranos blood tests from
[22:31:34] <manicennui> the Newark lab.[62]
[22:31:57] <imode> all rich people are evil, my dude.
[22:32:03] <manicennui> Nah.
[22:32:14] <imode> show me a rich person who isn't evil.
[22:33:00] <manicennui> My aunt and uncle.
[22:33:07] <imode> net worth?
[22:33:12] <manicennui> Several million each.
[22:33:24] <imode> that's pretty easy to achieve these days.
[22:33:28] <manicennui> Yes.
[22:33:31] <imode> wouldn't qualify that as rich.
[22:33:33] <manicennui> Which is why it isn't evil to be rich.
[22:33:35] <kline> its quite funny that SpiceDAO operators think that buying the book brings them the IP rights for the dune franchise
[22:34:04] <manicennui> kline: They actually don't seem to think that. They seem to think that it gives them the rights to the IP for the artwork and such.
[22:34:06] <imode> for grifters I always apply the inverse of hanlon's razor.
[22:34:16] <manicennui> The lead idiot said that they aren't going to make anything Dune related.
[22:34:26] <imode> never attribute to stupidity what can equally be attributed to malice.
[22:34:48] <manicennui> kline: They seem confused because the creator of the pitch book went on to adapt some of the work for other things.
[22:34:55] <kline> "2. Produce an original animated limited series inspired by the book and sell it to a streaming service"
[22:34:56] <manicennui> You know, the guy who actually owns the IP and is still alive.
[22:35:04] <manicennui> kline: Yes, not Dune.
[22:35:04] <kline> even if you buy the art, you cant use the wider IP
[22:35:10] <manicennui> kline: I know this.
[22:35:16] <manicennui> They seem thoroughly confused.
[22:35:18] <kline> i dont understand it then
[22:35:30] <kline> this kind of tech-harlequin style isnt unique
[22:35:38] <kline> see also w40k in the early era
[22:35:51] <manicennui> kline: I think you have to look at what Jodorowsky did with it.
[22:35:59] <manicennui> He created a bunch of comics and such that are not Dune.
[22:36:05] <manicennui> I think they believe that they can do the same.
[22:36:24] <kline> ok
[22:36:39] <kline> so theyre just fanboys who want to reuse the art style and also collect the original inspiration?
[22:36:44] <manicennui> If you listen to the podcast I linked to, the main idiot seems really confused about things.
[22:36:57] <manicennui> And believes that collecting shit is like the most important part of culture.
[22:37:06] <manicennui> And that he is taking power away from rich people.
[22:37:25] <imode> redistribute his wealth to homeless people and throw him in a deep dark hole.
[22:37:55] <manicennui> Like if you can raise $12 million, but you can't create original art, you are kind of the opposite of important culturally.
[22:38:04] <manicennui> They could have paid any number of artists to just create new IP.
[22:38:28] <manicennui> They paid way too much for the book, and got nothing that they think they did.
[22:38:37] <manicennui> The last copy sold in 2019 for like $45k.
[22:38:50] <kline> REDISTRIBUTE WEALTH BY CROWDSOURCING 2.5M AND GIVING IT TO ART COLLECTORS
[22:38:51] <kline> YESSSSSS
[22:39:12] <manicennui> kline: I'd argue that Kickstarter has done a bit of good in that regard.
[22:39:27] <manicennui> It's unfortunate that they always seem to be looking for ways to become more scummy.
[22:40:00] <kline> dunno, taking vast amounts of cash from all areas of society and funneling it into an art collectors pocket at auction
[22:40:25] <kline> that seems very much like centralising money from the lower classes into a single individual in the upper class who had the book previously
[22:40:35] <kline> thats probably not the wealth redistribution they had in mind
[22:40:35] <imode> arm the peasants and kill the rich.
[22:40:50] <manicennui> kline: If you listen to the guy talk, he isn't very smart.
[22:40:53] <manicennui> He talks like a stoner.
[22:41:00] <manicennui> Both in cadence/tone and in ideas.
[22:44:31] <manicennui> I hope my friend doesn't get sucked into the DAO nonsense.
[22:44:46] <manicennui> He has another friend who started trying to sell him on the idea of this one crazy dao.
[22:45:09] <manicennui> And at first he was pretty upset because he thought she was kind of dumb for doing it.
[22:45:19] <manicennui> But later it seemed like he might have decided to put some money in.
[22:45:38] <kline> im pretty keen on the idea of DAOs
[22:45:43] <kline> have been since the start
[22:45:52] <manicennui> They are a nice fantasy.
[22:45:53] <kline> they have proven themselves to not be effective
[22:45:57] <manicennui> And most of them will turn out to be scams.
[22:46:20] <manicennui> There is no need to involve crypto in those goals either.
[22:46:52] <manicennui> We have working versions of what DAOs hope to achieve. They are called coops.
[22:48:26] <manicennui> If some DAO people ever talk to me I'm going to act confused and assume that they are referring to data access objects in Java.
[22:51:40] <manicennui> L. Ron Hubbard would have loved all this shit.
[22:51:56] <manicennui> Wonder whether Scientology is getting into crypto.
[22:56:39] <manicennui> https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/linksdao-raised-millions-selling-nfts-to-buy-a-golf-course.html
[22:56:55] <manicennui> Someone should do that, but buy the golf courses and turn them into nature preserves.
[22:57:54] <manicennui> Don't really need a DAO to do it though.
[23:02:19] <manicennui> Watching the aftershow video for The Expanses S6E6. Ty mentions that when they were on SyFy they didn't do well but they were always in the top 10 to purchase on iTunes, Amazon, etc.
[23:02:34] <manicennui> I wonder when SyFy will give up on typing their channel to cable providers.
[23:02:39] <manicennui> Seems absolutely insane at this point.
[23:12:40] <manicennui> s/typing/tying/
[23:30:49] <kline> what i like about DAOs is the concept of them being automatically runnable
[23:31:02] <kline> ie, without any human intervention/need to interpret the rules, etc
[23:31:59] <manicennui> That isn't possible.
[23:32:08] <imode> order is a social construct.
[23:32:09] <kline> The DAO (the original instance of the concept) blew that up when they didnt like the cold, hard implementation of this and realised that they had written the contract poorly and their agreed upon system didnt match their intention
[23:32:12] <manicennui> At some point the rules must be executed in reality.
[23:32:14] <kline> manicennui, it is
[23:32:17] <manicennui> No computer shit will do that.
[23:32:45] <kline> ???
[23:32:48] <manicennui> And voting on things in a coop isn't some unknown problem that needed solving.
[23:33:23] <manicennui> kline: To do anything useful at all, at some point, something must happen in the real world, not in the computer.
[23:33:42] <manicennui> There is no computer program which can guarantee that or make it happen.
[23:33:50] <kline> yes, but those things happen outside the boundaries of the dao
[23:34:01] <manicennui> So DAOs can't do anything useful?
[23:34:24] <kline> for example, a dao could automatically submit an order to a company that builds houses and accepts ETH as payment
[23:34:54] <kline> no human needs to be doing stuff inside the dao to make that happen, the org can run itself
[23:35:03] <manicennui> That would require builders to accept ETH, which most aren't dumb enough to do, and it doesn't make sure the house is built and to spec.
[23:35:27] <kline> but this isnt really the core of it, what i really care about is that the contract/bylaws that specify how the org works are machine interpreted
[23:35:38] <manicennui> kline: You mean, after someone has written the code that makes all that happen, and never introduces bugs.
[23:35:51] <manicennui> And it is still about the least important and least useful thing imaginable.
[23:35:55] <kline> ie, there is no room for people squabbling over the wording of the contract for example saying "quorum is 50% of members, not >=50%"
[23:36:01] <manicennui> There are already thousands of orgs that do such things without DAOs.
[23:36:15] <manicennui> And running the organization is not the main source of problems.
[23:36:26] <kline> yes, and frequently you have issues with contract intepretation
[23:36:31] <kline> which could be solved in daos by just
[23:36:33] <kline> running
[23:36:35] <kline> the contract
[23:36:37] <manicennui> Bullshit.
[23:36:43] <kline> rather than having lawyers arbitrate it
[23:36:56] <manicennui> 1. You'd have to simplify the contract drastically.
[23:36:56] <kline> ok
[23:37:02] <manicennui> 2. Nothing is above the law.
[23:37:04] <kline> unfortunately the fire alarm has gone off
[23:37:06] <kline> so i need to go for now
[23:37:13] <kline> but in a bit ill be back if you want to discuss this
[23:37:22] <manicennui> I really don't.
[23:37:25] <manicennui> Because it is all nonsense.
[23:37:28] <kline> ok, then dont
[23:37:41] <kline> but automatic and objective contract interpretation is valuable
[23:37:51] <manicennui> And, not possible.
[23:38:02] <kline> its already happening
[23:38:05] <manicennui> Unless your contract is so simple as to be not very useful.
[23:38:14] <kline> well, thats a problem with eth/solidity
[23:38:16] <kline> not the concept
[23:38:28] <manicennui> No, it is a problem with reality.
[23:38:28] <kline> disclaimer: i hold 0 eth/btc/etc
[23:38:37] <manicennui> This sounds a lot like the flaws with libertarian thinking.
[23:38:40] <kline> i dont believe current stuff is good
[23:38:40] <manicennui> But computerized.
[23:38:42] <kline> but i like the idea
[23:38:55] <kline> ciao anyway
[23:39:23] <manicennui> There are dozens of steps involved in building a house or any kind of building beyond paying someone.
[23:39:37] <manicennui> I'm guessing that nearly all of these DAOs focus on the paying part.
[23:39:43] <manicennui> And assume people will start accepting ETH.
[23:40:06] <imode> even if it was in cash, a human still has to do something.
[23:46:13] <manicennui> Paying part or voting part.
[23:46:17] <manicennui> Neither of which is a major problem now.
[23:51:43] <manicennui> Building scamming people would probably be an order of magnitude easier with crypto.
[23:51:46] <manicennui> Builders
