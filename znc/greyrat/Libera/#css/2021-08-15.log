[00:58:33] <HvszrStykp> Hello, I have a container div containing an image (of unknown width) and another div with a few words of text. I want the text div to be horizontally aligned directly above the image (in other words, the position where the text starts is directly above the left side of the image). I want to center the container div in its enclosing div. Normally I would set margin: auto on the container div, but I can't
[00:58:39] <HvszrStykp> specify its width because the width of the image is unknown.
[00:59:20] <HvszrStykp> The reason I want to center the container div is to ensure that the text div and the image are aligned as desired, which they are if they are both in the same div. So maybe there is a better way to do this
[00:59:32] <matsaman> got some code?
[00:59:35] <HvszrStykp> Er sorry, those are separate things
[00:59:36] <matsaman> probably some flexbox for you

[01:07:42] <HvszrStykp> hassoon:  https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/380 Here it is, I think
[01:08:48] <HvszrStykp> Basically, I want the image to be centered, with the text left-aligned so that the left side (beginning) of the text is aligned with the left side of the image.
[01:09:02] <HvszrStykp> I guess the problem is that I can't specify the width of div#container (with the image width being unknown)
[01:09:41] <HvszrStykp> Right now in my actual code I'm using text-align: center on #main and then resetting text-align: left inside of #container, which works.
[01:09:52] <HvszrStykp> But I guess we're not supposed to do that
[01:10:38] <HvszrStykp> Using text-align to center divs is like using tables for page layout, I guess. It works better but it's heresy. :-)
[01:10:56] <matsaman> hasn't been a thing since really really old IE
[01:12:24] <HvszrStykp> IE 5 for Mac OS 9 was one of my favorite browsers
[01:12:34] <matsaman> heh
[01:13:27] <hassoon> HvszrStykp: like that https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/381 ?
[01:14:41] <HvszrStykp> Woah, "fit-content" ?
[01:14:48] <HvszrStykp> Thanks, let me try this in my code
[01:15:23] <hassoon> HvszrStykp: that too, if you're concerned .. https://i.imgur.com/Us2vG3B.png
[01:17:36] <HvszrStykp> Thanks, that worked...
[01:17:46] <HvszrStykp> Wow, should I be worried about that? Or didn't they recently phase out IE?
[01:18:11] <HvszrStykp> I have not updated my CSS knowledge since about 2005 so I guess this was a really basic question but thanks

[05:24:05] <skidz> hey
[05:24:33] <skidz> what is the correct way of displaying an image in the center of the page? like both vertically and horizontally centered.
[05:25:11] <skidz> in 2021 this should be possible with css, right?
[05:25:35] <skidz> (and without js)
[05:27:31] <oksushi> `center @ skidz
[05:27:32] <Selvvir> skidz, How to center anything: https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/
[05:28:10] <skidz> thanks :)
[05:31:45] <skidz> interestingly, none of the displayed methods actually center the content both vertically and horizontally.
[05:32:37] <skidz> inside the white element they are centered, but the white element isn't centered in the page.
[05:34:44] <skidz> also, in the examples, the css and html code do not match at all. they are completely different.
[05:36:06] *** Joins: asbachb (~asbachb@190.148.209.14)
[05:36:38] *** plenum is now known as phenom
[05:38:01] <skidz> the only method that works on desktop is the grid method
[05:38:10] <skidz> but it doesn't work on mobile.
[05:38:22] <skidz> like i thought, it still isn't possible.
[05:38:39] <skidz> whoever is responsible for css, they are kidding.
[05:44:03] <skidz> like, you have to use "css tricks" to get it centered.
[05:44:07] <skidz> like wtf?
[05:44:16] <skidz> why?
[05:49:11] <skidz> so i used the background-image and that one works.
[05:49:33] <skidz> even though i have to use media queries to display it correctly on small screens.
[05:55:06] <oksushi> skidz: they do work, but most likely there’s something else happening (like the body not being 100% of the viewport height). If you link to your page, we can help you triage the issue
[05:56:50] <skidz> i already did it using background-image.
[05:57:03] <skidz> i'm not interested in using any css tricks.
[05:57:13] <skidz> thanks for the offer though!

[06:59:13] <matsaman> heh
[06:59:37] <skidz> thanks for the hint. i will add doctypes.
[06:59:52] <matsaman> all of the doctypes
[07:00:03] <LiftLeft> https://jsfiddle.net/5obpnxkr/ the button element is too large, it's causing a bottom margin I don't want. I highlighted it in red.
[07:00:57] <matsaman> LiftLeft: vertical-align: bottom;
[07:01:06] <oksushi> LiftLeft: buttons are inline elements (inline-block) so they sit on the “baseline”
[07:01:33] <oksushi> you can change the vertical-align as matsaman suggests (or a few other solutions based on requirements)
[07:01:56] <skidz> oksushi: find any other errors?
[07:02:00] <LiftLeft> thanks that worked
[07:02:03] <oksushi> an image of what you’re experiencing here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(typography)
[07:02:55] <matsaman> what is this image anyway?
[07:03:53] <matsaman> it's pretty unlikely you'd want this SVG to show up with CSS disabled
[07:04:00] <matsaman> which means it should probably be a background image
[07:04:13] <matsaman> most times you need to use vertical-align: bottom; to remove a gap next to an image, this is the case
