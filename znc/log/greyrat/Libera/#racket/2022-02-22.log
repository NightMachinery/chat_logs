[10:05:03] <klf> What is the Racket eqivalent to a Python 'None', if there is one at all?
[10:07:08] <winny> #f usually indicates an absence of data
[10:08:26] <winny> In python functions return None if no explicit return is used, in Racket this is `(void)`, which is kind of different, though also indicates an absence of data or useful result
[10:11:15] <winny> https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/void_undefined.html (there's a section on boolean but doesn't seem to discuss the semantics of how most racket programs use #f, I remember in scheme r5rs there is a nice description of the intended behavior.)
[10:12:49] <winny> "Of all the standard Scheme values, only #f counts as false in conditional expressions. Except for #f, all standard Scheme values, including #t, pairs, the empty list, symbols, numbers, strings, vectors, and procedures, count as true." <- in this way None and False are usually collapsed into the same value in Racket  https://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/

[17:05:34] <undltd> but yeah, I think I underappreciate symbols:)
[17:05:38] <undltd> coming from Python
[17:07:11] <bremner> I think winny's suggestion of using #f is probably good, even if unpythonic. In particular people probably expect "None" to be "falsy"
[17:07:56] <bremner> if using one of typed variants, there are option types, which are a cleaner alternative
[17:09:36] <bremner> hmm. I only find "optionof" in plait / plait-typed. Those are mainly used in PL courses I suspect.
[17:15:34] <undltd> yeah, I actually find the only-#f-is-false approach cleaner
[17:18:49] <undltd> It's only when I need to distinguish #f as a valid value from a lack of value when I start to think of none
[17:19:43] <undltd> So a symbol might do, or `unsupplied-arg`

[18:09:27] <winny> Let's consider a use case where a boolean result is needed in addition to no data. That's a ternary (three valued boolean) result, not sure if you want that in your api? 
[18:11:07] <winny> In python are there some standard library examples that use both None and False as a return value?
[18:12:08] <samth> Usually #f is the standard approach. In cases where that's potentially ambigious, a common option is to provide a callback for the "missing" case.
