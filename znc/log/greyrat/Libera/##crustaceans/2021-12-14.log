[00:06:29] <manicennui> Surely he is rich at this point.
[00:06:37] <manicennui> Does being rich just rot one's brain?
[00:06:46] <manicennui> All one can think about once they are rich is getting richer?
[00:17:01] <dimadima> manicennui: congratulations. you are Web Scal
[00:17:03] <dimadima> Scale
[00:17:38] <manicennui> Because our database is huge?
[00:17:47] <dimadima> "We are at some limit of the underlying storage."
[00:17:51] <manicennui> Or because I discovered the rich person brain virus?
[00:17:56] <manicennui> Ah.
[00:18:14] <manicennui> I don't even understand the limit. I think it is some limit of our SAN, but it doesn't seem like a real limit in 2021.
[00:18:24] <manicennui> Apparently we can't create a volume larger than 16TB or something.
[00:18:31] <dimadima> saw a sign just now when i was driving that said "Covid is a virus of the mind. Turn off all media"
[00:18:59] <dimadima> have you tried using a File Allocation Table
[00:20:05] <dimadima> "gameinformer - Gala Games has announced a $100 million blockchain gaming fund that will help fund play-to-earn games from Peter Molyneux,..."
[00:20:09] <dimadima> is not unlike that grimes quote
[00:20:48] <dimadima> "I’m more interested in a radical decentralized ubi that I think could potentially be achieved thru crypto and gaming but I haven’t ironed that idea out enough yet to explain it."
[00:20:53] <dimadima> well here it is
[00:21:05] <dimadima> you don't really have to iron it out
[00:21:22] <dimadima> just do it
[00:22:33] <manicennui> I never know what these people actually mean when they use the term "decentralized", or why it would be desirable.
[00:22:52] <manicennui> I kind of get it in the delusional philosophy of cryptocurrency.
[00:23:11] <manicennui> But most of the other people who latch on to the blockchain fad seem to use it without any clear meaning.
[00:25:46] <dimadima> i think it means you're a digital serf in the digital feudalism
[00:27:06] <manicennui> I wonder how difficult it is to get POTS lines to new locations these days.
[00:27:07] <dimadima> that so many people are so earnestly racing to
[00:27:11] <manicennui> Like undeveloped land.
[00:27:30] <dimadima> i don't think it happens
[00:27:36] <dimadima> i mean, you could i'm sure
[00:27:43] <dimadima> but i wonder what the telco would do
[00:27:52] <dimadima> with that laine
[00:27:53] <dimadima> line*
[00:27:53] <manicennui> It seems like such a mistake to give up on POTS.
[00:28:19] <manicennui> We are becoming super dependent on a handful of companies and proprietary technologies.
[00:29:22] <bkero> That's definitely a problem
[00:29:23] <manicennui> And they are all far more expensive than POTS service was.
[00:29:37] <bkero> Hoe many servicers could you get on your theoretical new POTS line?
[00:29:59] <manicennui> Mostly one per area I'm sure.
[00:30:29] * manicennui remembers ILECs and CLECs.
[00:30:40] <manicennui> Think that is all over with.
[00:30:54] <manicennui> Mostly because the ILECs made it a living hell and then acquired everyone.
[00:31:28] <dimadima> when did you start using a modem manicennui
[00:31:33] <dimadima> late 80s? 90s?
[00:31:36] <manicennui> Mid 90s.
[00:31:43] <dimadima> like everyone else
[00:31:57] <manicennui> I mean, some of you weren't born.
[00:32:02] <dimadima> :)
[00:32:02] <manicennui> Whippersnappers!
[00:32:08] <dimadima> i was born
[00:32:16] <dimadima> my mom had a 9600 baud us robotics
[00:32:20] <dimadima> and a vt 220
[00:32:25] <manicennui> I *loved* my dial-up ISPs in the late 90s.
[00:32:29] <dimadima> that was pretty awesome
[00:32:33] <dimadima> me too
[00:32:38] <dimadima> baltimore county public library
[00:32:40] <manicennui> They were a local company and very transparent.
[00:32:55] <manicennui> Offered tons of options, especially during the 56k battles.
[00:32:58] <dimadima> you could SLIP or PPP to them
[00:33:12] <dimadima> god the 56k battles
[00:33:15] <dimadima> i had forgotten that
[00:33:22] <dimadima> my house couldn't clear 33.6
[00:33:44] <dimadima> those were pretty miserable times, not even being able to get 56k
[00:33:51] <manicennui> Could you realistically update modern software over dial-up?
[00:33:59] <dimadima> no
[00:34:00] <manicennui> Seems like it would take days to download updates.
[00:34:14] <dimadima> i tried to download the game Sin over 33.6
[00:34:31] <manicennui> Games are a special case, but even mobile app updates are huge.
[00:34:39] <dimadima> yeah
[00:34:45] <manicennui> Back in the day we updated our OSes, browsers, etc.
[00:34:47] <dimadima> in those days an MP3 downloaded at like 0.5x
[00:34:52] <manicennui> And sometimes it took a while, but not all day.
[00:34:54] <dimadima> or even less. you couldn't stream one
[00:35:03] <dimadima> i remember when i could stream MP3 that was magical
[00:35:12] <manicennui> I'd like to see some kind of ADSL service over POTS again.
[00:35:18] <dimadima> yeah
[00:35:50] <manicennui> There has to be a point where ADSL is good enough for most things other than maybe HD streaming and such.
[00:35:57] <manicennui> I'd be fine with that in my cottage.
[00:36:26] * manicennui imagines what it would be like to have no Internet access for weeks or months.
[00:36:48] <dimadima> Internet is one of those things that's both awesome and horrible
[00:36:55] <dimadima> i wouldn't want to not have Internet
[00:37:03] <manicennui> I mostly don't see it as a benefit to me anymore.
[00:37:21] <manicennui> I definitely use it for convenience, but in most of those cases I think I'd be better off not using it.
[00:38:01] <dimadima> i just wish that google is so worthless
[00:38:10] <dimadima> i wish there was an informational search engine
[00:38:21] <dimadima> not like 20 pages of news links
[00:38:52] <dimadima> the internet could be better even with its present economic boundary values
[00:39:30] <dimadima> if you asked me 20 years ago whether lexis nexus would be a thing in 2021
[00:39:34] <dimadima> i'd say no
[00:39:58] <dimadima> yet here we are today and you basically can't do research on the web without access to proprietary data bases
[00:40:08] <dimadima> the internet in some ways never happened
[00:40:19] <manicennui> I think for me it boils down to how I maintain my income.
[00:40:26] <dimadima> "lexisnexis"
[00:40:39] <dimadima> what do you mean by that
[00:40:41] <manicennui> Without that I'd have more options.
[00:40:47] <manicennui> Of not having Internet.
[00:40:51] <manicennui> Or very limited access.
[00:40:52] <dimadima> oh
[00:40:53] <dimadima> yes
[00:42:35] <dimadima> it's definitely pretty hard to opt out of the internet
[00:43:16] <dimadima> i wouldn't want to opt out though
[00:43:53] <dimadima> but maybe i'm just brainwashed
[00:44:01] <dimadima> i like the neatness of computers too much
[00:52:24] <Geekingfrog> I think it also has a social component. It's way harder to opt out when everyone else is in there.
[00:57:11] <dimadima> yeah you have to be willing to stop existing for everyone except real friends
[00:57:16] <dimadima> who mostly dont exist for most people
[00:57:20] <dimadima> sadly
[00:58:04] <Geekingfrog> Recently I was in a situation where basically cell phones weren't working. You definitly have to adjust a lot of things to meet with ppl. I think it's the same with the internet.
[01:00:45] <manicennui> dimadima: I have already done that.
[01:00:51] <manicennui> dimadima: And my employer.
[01:01:26] <dimadima> yeah
[01:01:37] <dimadima> me too more or less, and i don't have an employer
[01:01:38] <dimadima> :/
[01:01:41] <manicennui> My employer is the problem.
[01:01:51] <dimadima> yeah
[01:01:53] <manicennui> Wanting me to do work and be available.
[01:01:55] <manicennui> Pfft.
[01:14:24] <indigo> Clearly we need to send you to the Clojure monastery
[01:16:44] <manicennui> Please do.
[01:16:54] <manicennui> Why don't we have non-religious monasteries?
[01:17:05] <epilys> communes?
[01:17:19] <manicennui> Hmm. True.
[01:17:44] <manicennui> Ever read Anathem?
[01:18:39] <manicennui> I think it would be cool to spend some time at one of the bases in Antartica.
[01:18:56] <manicennui> Antarctica
[01:19:01] <epilys> pun intended?
[01:19:11] <manicennui> ?
[01:19:15] <epilys> "cool"
[01:19:17] <manicennui> heh
[01:19:21] <epilys> I agree but if you're not used to solitude it might be a shock
[01:19:22] <manicennui> No, but I like it.
[01:19:43] <manicennui> Some of them have a few dozen people (I don't know whether there are actually multiple bases).
[01:20:04] <manicennui> Would still be far different from normal life.
[01:20:12] <manicennui> Hopefully no one is super annoying though.
[01:20:22] <manicennui> Otherwise they'd have to have an accident.
[01:20:23] <epilys> Haha that was exactly my thought
[01:20:58] <epilys> I think I read somewhere about some people fighting bad in a research station
[01:21:05] <epilys> (No, it wasn't the Thing)
[01:21:21] <manicennui> Did you see the recent George Clooney movie?
[01:21:36] <manicennui> About the end of the world.
[01:21:41] <epilys> yeah but was kinda flat? plot-wise
[01:21:55] <manicennui> I liked it, but I like movies with solitude like that.
[01:21:59] <manicennui> And mental problems.
[01:22:08] <gwozniak> I liked it too, even though it was a bit dull
[01:22:16] <epilys> It was very aesthetic.
[01:22:27] <epilys> The station was very well done
[01:22:29] <manicennui> Although I had some questions about the incest that was implied.
[01:22:44] <epilys> Oof I don't recall any of that
[01:22:46] <manicennui> (two people restarting humanity)
[01:22:51] <gwozniak> I caught on to the situation right away, but yeah, I'm always a fan of solitude movies
[01:22:56] <gwozniak> Moon is a great one
[01:23:18] <manicennui> The incest wasn't in the movie, but if two people restart humanity, it is kind of required.
[01:23:56] <manicennui> Is it even feasible for one couple to restart a species?
[01:24:13] <dimadima> why not
[01:24:16] <epilys> Don't think so. Iiirc you need at least ~9-10k people to prevent deathly inbreeding
[01:24:19] <manicennui> dimadima: Genetic problems.
[01:24:48] <dimadima> i don't know jews did it in north italy with 70
[01:25:02] <manicennui> dimadima: They never had non-Jewish partners?
[01:25:04] <dimadima> or so is posutlated re: ashekanzik news
[01:25:06] <dimadima> jews
[01:25:07] <gwozniak> If you ever watch "See" (about humanity losing the sense of sight), they actually mention the inbreeding problem
[01:25:27] <dimadima> manicennui: to some extent probably but unclear
[01:25:34] <dimadima> not willingly most likely
[01:25:41] <epilys> https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AcAau..97...16S/abstract
[01:25:42] <buttsbot> Estimation of a genetically viable population for multigenerational interstellar voyaging: Review and data for project Hyperion - NASA/ADS
[01:26:07] <manicennui> Even if it were feasible, how do you broach that subject?
[01:26:08] <epilys> Ok apparently (and non-surprisingly) there's a diversity of numbers proposed
[01:26:10] <manicennui> "Kids..."
[01:26:23] <dimadima> who said siblings?
[01:26:26] <dimadima> did i miss that above
[01:26:33] <manicennui> dimadima: The movie had an adult couple.
[01:26:41] <dimadima> definitely more problematic with siblings i imagine
[01:26:46] <manicennui> So the kids would have to be involved.
[01:27:44] <dimadima> yikes
[01:28:01] <manicennui> The chances that they would survive at all were pretty slim.
[01:28:12] <manicennui> I think they were headed to some distant planet that they hoped would support life.
[01:29:01] <dimadima> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews#Genetic_origins
[01:29:01] <buttsbot> Ashkenazi Jews - Wikipedia
[01:29:26] <dimadima> flourished during the Roman Empire but then went through a 'severe bottleneck' as they dispersed, reducing a population of several million to just 400 families
[01:29:32] <dimadima> that's a bunch
[01:29:44] <dimadima> no 70 people but not 9-10k either
[01:29:59] <dimadima> ashkenazi jwes aren't known for their genetics but
[01:30:02] <dimadima> exist nonetheless
[01:30:05] <demiurge> i think 10k is something like the minimum human population, as estimated by our current genetic diversity
[01:30:26] <demiurge> the minimum viable population is obviously not known but is probably between 100 and 200
[01:30:34] <manicennui> dimadima: There are actually diseases which affect Ashkenazi Jews at a higher rate.
[01:30:44] <dimadima> that's what i'm saying
[01:30:49] <dimadima> man such diseases
[01:30:56] <dimadima> many*
[01:31:28] <demiurge> for the species to survive on the absolute minimum, though, you'd need to optimise your breeding to maximise diversity
[01:31:31] <demiurge> which might be a hard sell
[01:32:21] <gwozniak> So, if various southern states were broken off into their own country, you're saying there will be a breeding problem?
[01:32:41] <manicennui> I already have a problem with many of those people breeding.
[01:33:04] <demiurge> well, let's not go full hackernews
[01:33:08] <manicennui> heh
[01:33:14] <gwozniak> :D
[01:33:24] <manicennui> To be clear, I don't actually support eugenics.
[01:33:31] <manicennui> But I think people should breed a whole lot less.
[01:33:53] <gwozniak> Elon Musk (Time Man of the Year!) thinks otherwise!
[01:34:06] <manicennui> People like my brother are definitely trying to bring about Idiocracy.
[01:35:01] <manicennui> One of the things that Idiocracy missed is that most forms of entertainment will be superhero movies and shows.
[01:35:35] <bkero> Ugh.
[01:35:52] <gwozniak> Some of my best friends dearly love those shows, but I have grown tired of them, for the most part
[01:36:08] <demiurge> gwozniak: proof, were any required, that time's person of the year is for time's benefit, not the person's
[01:36:21] <gwozniak> demiurge: absolutely
[01:36:51] <manicennui> I wonder what would happen if we isolated Elon Musk for 6 months.
[01:37:04] <dimadima> lol
[01:37:09] <dimadima> fucking nothing
[01:37:13] <manicennui> Just put him on an island with a house.
[01:37:17] <manicennui> Airdrop supplies.
[01:37:22] <manicennui> But no Internet access or anything.
[01:37:23] <dimadima> i like how our thomas edison is elon musk
[01:37:31] <demiurge> can you get withdrawal from the blood of newborns?
[01:37:34] <manicennui> I think most people would change quite a bit.
[01:37:40] <dimadima> lol
[01:37:45] <dimadima> how
[01:38:15] <manicennui> Haven't you ever gone on vacation for a couple weeks and done none of your normal things and come back and feel weird?
[01:38:39] <manicennui> Unplugging from the rat race for a while has a big effect on me.
[01:38:43] <dimadima> oh you mean he would hange
[01:38:44] <dimadima> change
[01:38:47] <dimadima> yes, probably
[01:38:57] <manicennui> Yes, not the rest of us. We would still suck.
[01:38:59] <dimadima> i thought you meant we'd all change
[01:39:04] <dimadima> from missing him
[01:39:18] <manicennui> I wonder whether he would come back and behave differently.
[01:39:23] <demiurge> no, i come back and feel disappointed that i can't get paid to drink wine and pootle around the coast in a kayak
[01:39:40] <manicennui> demiurge: That's what I mean though.
[01:40:20] <manicennui> You decompress and your mind stops some of its destructive cycles, or slows them down a bit.
[01:41:12] <manicennui> You might think of what you'd like to do if money were not a concern, but on vacation sometimes you can actually get in that mindset for a bit.
[01:41:47] <demiurge> i don't know if my mind is in any destructive cycles, it's just being constrained externally by the capitalist loop
[01:41:52] <manicennui> I sometimes get that when I have a really long conversation with my friends.
[01:41:55] <manicennui> Or hang out all day.
[01:42:25] <manicennui> demiurge: That's what I mean. The destructive need to continue to play the game.
[01:42:39] <manicennui> Even though we don't actually have serious problems with survival anymore.
[01:42:51] <manicennui> We're doing all this crap to gain power and wealth.
[01:42:55] <manicennui> At least more than others.
[01:43:05] <manicennui> Well, we are doing it so someone can gain power and wealth.
[01:43:23] <manicennui> There aren't good reasons for housing and food to be scarce for anyone.
[01:49:30] <dimadima> i like how eventually everything "simple" turns into this https://i.imgur.com/IEEIgVG.png
[01:49:34] <dimadima> something like that, anyway
[02:34:20] <manicennui> Is that basically a template for an HTML link?

[03:43:32] <dimadima> those are the files thus far that are involved in the frontend part of an "invite" feature
[03:43:52] <dimadima> invite with a personalized link, or send emails
[03:44:51] <dimadima> to manage complexity, everything "little" thing ends up lots of files
[03:45:29] <dimadima> and requires lots of polish
[03:45:32] <dimadima> annoying
[03:45:37] <dimadima> :(
[03:45:55] <dimadima> it's really the managing of complexity that makes everything complicted, in a way
[03:46:04] <dimadima> in my case, anyway
[03:49:33] <dimadima> pretty tired of programming maybe i'll just quit lol
[03:49:45] <dimadima> and become a beggar
[03:53:51] <dimadima> every day these days i'm some form of miserable
[03:54:03] <dimadima> nothing too bad, but the dread/terror is real
[03:54:34] <dimadima> i'm basically the jeff atwood coding horror avatar
[03:57:35] <indigo> Look at the bright side, dimadima, at least you don't have to deal much with crappy requirements being shoved down your throat
[03:59:49] <manicennui> dimadima: I think the problem is mostly frontend development.
[04:00:16] <manicennui> I'm moving my team further and further away from the frontend, and my manager supports it.
[04:01:19] <manicennui> Although I had to look into logging out users recently which involved learning about JWT and realizing that the people working on our frontend should not be in charge of things like auth.
[04:02:19] <manicennui> I feel like I'm taking crazy pills every time I learn about some new thing frontend people are doing.

[05:30:37] <dimadima> thanks indigo that's very true
[05:31:51] <dimadima> manicennui: my frontend is pleasant enough, it even kinda sorta brings me joy. it's just working on boring rote features is not cool for me right now
[05:33:18] <dimadima> like, i need a marketing/money raising cofounder
[05:33:29] <dimadima> so i can work on tech and know someone is marketing and raising money
[05:33:50] <dimadima> what are your frontend devs doing that's crazy besides JWT
[05:34:08] <dimadima> JWT has a really narrow scope of usefulness but somehow it became widely adopted for all kinds of things
[05:34:22] <dimadima> i use JWT, but basically just like a session token
[05:34:58] <dimadima> my tokens expire after 15 minutes
[05:35:07] <imode> the web sucks.
[05:35:12] <dimadima> it's weird you can't just log someoene out
[05:35:36] <dimadima> but it's nice that there's a standard that other things know how to use
[05:35:36] <imode> yeah. because you have to reinvent TCP/IP sessions.
[05:35:45] <manicennui> dimadima: I just feel like frontend web stuff is still more annoying than frontend GUI stuff was in the 90s.
[05:35:57] <imode> because someone stupid thought to themselves "huh, what if we just spin up a new connection for every request".
[05:35:59] <dimadima> imode: i don't know TCP/IP sessions :|
[05:36:01] <manicennui> And everything feels like a pile of hacks.
[05:36:17] <dimadima> imode: HTTP2 baby
[05:36:26] <imode> doesn't matter, the model is still the same.
[05:36:35] <dimadima> if that's what you mean by HTTP sessions
[05:36:39] <dimadima> you mean long connections
[05:36:46] <imode> yes. actual, tangible TCP connections.
[05:36:47] <dimadima> erm, TCP/IP
[05:36:55] <manicennui> I just raised some concerns about JWT at work. We do lending.
[05:37:03] <manicennui> And they are treating it like we are Twitter or something.
[05:37:06] <imode> that hold for longer than a single send receive cycle.
[05:37:11] <dimadima> imode: some people do things like RPC from their frontends
[05:37:20] <imode> yes. keep a fucking connection open.
[05:37:24] <imode> a single. connection.
[05:37:25] <manicennui> 5 minute access tokens and nothing checks for revoked access tokens.
[05:38:01] <imode> I don't have proof for this but I'm fairly confident that the request model was designed in the `select` era to save on active connections.
[05:38:26] <dimadima> manicennui: what's someone going to do with a 5 minute access token in reality though?
[05:38:37] <manicennui> dimadima: We are currently trying to deal with active fraud.
[05:38:39] <dimadima> what can they do through your frontend?
[05:38:39] <imode> it'd make sense. `select` has a finite number of descriptors it can watch.
[05:38:57] <manicennui> If they actually know what they are doing, they won't be logged out for up to 5 minutes.
[05:38:59] <imode> so a single request/response cycle requires a single connection during that cycle and nothing else.
[05:39:27] <dimadima> imode: what's the `select` era?
[05:39:37] <manicennui> He means the system call.
[05:39:40] <imode> ^
[05:39:45] <dimadima> ah
[05:40:11] <dimadima> manicennui: well yeah. i guess people would be motivated to study your system then get tokens
[05:40:30] <dimadima> but what would they be able to achieve with another user's token? get their documents? update their address?
[05:40:38] * manicennui remembers when the FreeBSD people built a high performance FTP server on a Pentium Pro 200 that saturated a gigabit connection when gigabit was new.
[05:40:40] <dimadima> hey I'm not saying JWT makes sense for a lender lol
[05:40:43] <imode> when connections are expensive to maintain because you can't handle >1024 without fancy shmancy handling, it makes sense to have connections appear and disappear. your constant load becomes instantaneous load.
[05:41:06] <imode> so you can handle 1024 requests simultaneously, instead of 1024 users simultaneously.
[05:41:09] <manicennui> dimadima: Not another user's token. They basically apply for a loan using stolen info.
[05:41:14] <manicennui> dimadima: Or steal accounts.
[05:41:19] <manicennui> They log in as the real user.
[05:41:31] <manicennui> But when we detect fraud, I want to immediately kill their session.
[05:41:32] <dimadima> damn
[05:41:36] <manicennui> But I can't do that, because JWT.
[05:41:39] <dimadima> lol
[05:41:43] <dimadima> that's terrible
[05:41:53] <dimadima> well you'll have to add a revokation thing
[05:41:58] <dimadima> but then everything will ave to check that
[05:42:03] <manicennui> And we didn't implement a revoke list or check with the token server for important functions.
[05:42:06] <dimadima> or you'll have it in your "gateway" or whatever
[05:42:14] <manicennui> They just said, "OMG WEB STUFF! JWT!"
[05:42:24] <dimadima> yeah that's terrible and seems to be quite, quite common
[05:42:30] <dimadima> at least given what you see on HN
[05:42:44] <manicennui> Which would be fine if we did something where the impact of fraud was mere annoyance.
[05:43:23] *** Joins: cation21 (cation@user/cation)
[05:43:28] <dimadima> well all that said
[05:43:31] <dimadima> JWT is pretty cool
[05:43:41] <imode> why is it cool.
[05:43:44] <manicennui> Our volume isn't even high enough to justify not using classic sessions.
[05:43:47] <dimadima> it's a standard
[05:43:56] <dimadima> so like i didn't write Hasura
[05:43:57] <manicennui> We should just use redis as a session server and be done with it.
[05:43:58] <imode> several things have standards.
[05:44:08] <imode> that doesn't make them useful, cool or desirable.
[05:44:14] <imode> why is JWT cool.
[05:44:15] <manicennui> It's a standard, but it is entirely possible, and very common, to configure it incorrectly.
[05:44:18] <dimadima> but Hasura can read my JWTs to provide authentication/authorization
[05:44:26] <dimadima> and i can read them too, obviously
[05:44:29] *** Quits: cation (cation@user/cation) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[05:44:34] <dimadima> hasura has other ways of doing auth
[05:44:48] <imode> it's cool because it's easy. because someone else wrote it.
[05:44:53] <dimadima> but with JWTs everything becomes appreciably simplers and lighter
[05:44:58] <imode> 99% of software is cool, then.
[05:44:59] <dimadima> except the one issue around logout
[05:45:05] <manicennui> I think microservices made the push for JWT stronger.
[05:45:17] <dimadima> microservices is crazy though
[05:45:20] <dimadima> i do agree with that
[05:45:33] <imode> all webdev circles devolve into "if it's easy/new/hyped, it's cool".
[05:45:38] <imode> JWT is shit.
[05:45:54] <dimadima> well okay
[05:45:55] <manicennui> imode: Don't you work on aws?
[05:46:03] <manicennui> Or was that someone else?
[05:46:11] <dimadima> either i can ping a remote identity server for every single auth
[05:46:19] <dimadima> or i can pull that identity state to me
[05:46:19] <imode> https://redis.com/blog/json-web-tokens-jwt-are-dangerous-for-user-sessions/ here's a lovely article.
[05:46:20] <buttsbot> JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are Dangerous for User Sessions—Here’s a Solution | Redis
[05:46:32] <manicennui> imode: Yeah, I like that article.
[05:46:38] <manicennui> And there are dozens like it.
[05:46:41] <imode> mhm.
[05:46:45] <imode> JWT is shit.
[05:46:46] *** cation21 is now known as cation
[05:46:56] <dimadima> this article is just the same exact thing
[05:46:58] <imode> it's just "cool" because you can use it with something that's already been written.
[05:47:01] <manicennui> I like how they show how to use redis for a revoke list, and then say, "At that point, just use redis for sessions."
[05:47:02] <dimadima> 1. Logout doesn’t really log you out!
[05:47:05] <dimadima> yes
[05:47:15] <dimadima> > 2. Blocking users doesn’t immediately block them.
[05:47:16] <dimadima> yes.
[05:47:25] <dimadima> > 3. Could have stale data
[05:47:30] <dimadima> a rehash really of 1 and 2
[05:47:33] <imode> say it with me now, JWT is shit.
[05:47:34] <manicennui> I actually had this exact argument with our enterprise architect earlier.
[05:47:42] <dimadima> > 4. JWT’s are often not encrypted so anyone able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and sniff the JWT now has your authentication credentials. This is made easier because the MITM attack only needs to be completed on the connection between the server and the client.
[05:47:43] <manicennui> He suggested a revoke list in redis.
[05:47:49] <manicennui> I said we should just do sessions in redis then.
[05:47:50] <dimadima> yes and it's redis.com
[05:47:53] <dimadima> yep
[05:48:00] <dimadima> and that is the logical conclusion
[05:48:01] <imode> why not. you're authoritative at that point.
[05:48:04] <manicennui> He seemed to believe that a revoke list is better because the data set is small.
[05:48:07] <imode> as you fucking _should be_.
[05:48:08] <dimadima> but i'm not sure 1. - 4. above are so bad
[05:48:12] <dimadima> if you keep your scope of use narrow
[05:48:14] <imode> they're pretty bad.
[05:48:16] <manicennui> But the connections and roundtrip are the proble.m
[05:48:19] <imode> yeah so narrow that it's nearly zero.
[05:48:19] <dimadima> 1-3 are the same
[05:48:21] <manicennui> Not the data in redis.
[05:48:23] <dimadima> and 4 is solvable
[05:48:35] <manicennui> dimadima: Know what solves all of them?
[05:48:36] <dimadima> JWTs can easily be encrypted
[05:48:40] <dimadima> a session token
[05:48:42] <imode> lmfao.
[05:48:50] <imode> JWT is shiiiiiit~
[05:48:53] <dimadima> lol
[05:48:55] <imode> webshits can't program.
[05:48:59] <dimadima> lolol
[05:49:02] <imode> all this and more at n-gate.com
[05:49:12] <dimadima> \o/
[05:49:42] <dimadima> i mean i do agree
[05:49:48] *** Joins: martian67| (~martian67@user/martian67)
[05:49:50] <dimadima> just sometimes you need a token that expires
[05:49:53] <dimadima> JWT has some perfect usecases
[05:49:57] <dimadima> for example
[05:50:06] <imode> seriously, I'm so tired of "thing X is awesome because I got a dopamine rush of not having to write code or do some basic architecting for this thing I'm writing that's simple enough a five year old could puzzle it out"
[05:50:17] <imode> no, you're just using shit someone else wrote.
[05:50:21] <dimadima> someone needs to access an attachment with authentication/authorization
[05:50:39] <dimadima> they need to pass the token in the URL, as part of the query, which is horrible
[05:50:42] <dimadima> but there's just no way around it
[05:50:46] *** Quits: martian67 (~martian67@user/martian67) (Remote host closed the connection)
[05:50:51] <imode> "there's just no way around it"
[05:51:01] <dimadima> well, you can use a serviceworker
[05:51:02] <imode> famous last words, there.
[05:51:14] <dimadima> but not all your platforms support serviceworkers!
[05:51:17] <imode> an attachment. as in, an attachment on what.
[05:51:18] <dimadima> for example!
[05:51:20] <imode> an e-mail.
[05:51:30] <dimadima> i'm sorry
[05:51:34] <dimadima> attachment -> file
[05:51:42] <dimadima> that you want to serve over HTTP to a logged in user
[05:51:55] <dimadima> like in Gmail you have access to a file because you're logged in
[05:51:57] <manicennui> dimadima: That assumes that you design things in a way where they access individual services directly.
[05:52:02] <imode> okay. so presumably you're already doing session management.
[05:52:03] <manicennui> For most sites, there is no reason to do that.
[05:52:08] <dimadima> imode: yes
[05:52:14] <imode> so why JWT.
[05:52:14] <manicennui> Just have a frontend server and send everything through that.
[05:52:19] <imode> you already have the fucking session.
[05:52:29] <dimadima> because it's a GET request
[05:52:30] <imode> why do you have to hand someone a fastpass ticket.
[05:52:38] <dimadima> so you have the browser send the session!
[05:52:42] <manicennui> dimadima: It will send the cookie with a get request.
[05:52:44] <dimadima> you can't*
[05:52:46] <imode> bruh
[05:52:48] <imode> do you just like.
[05:52:50] <imode> not know about cookies.
[05:52:54] <imode> we solved this problem.
[05:52:55] <manicennui> dimadima: I think there is another piece in there.
[05:52:56] <dimadima> i know about cookies
[05:52:58] <dimadima> lol
[05:53:05] <imode> so. why do you need to send shit. in the URL.
[05:53:10] <manicennui> I assume your attachments are served from another domain.
[05:53:10] <dimadima> but not all your platforms support cookies!
[05:53:14] <dimadima> correctly
[05:53:20] <manicennui> What?
[05:53:20] <imode> name me a platform that doesn't support cookies.
[05:53:25] <imode> seriously.
[05:53:26] <imode> name me one.
[05:53:28] <manicennui> Gemini
[05:53:30] <companion_cube> can't the JWT be a cookie?
[05:53:31] <dimadima> let me show you one
[05:53:32] <companion_cube> :D
[05:53:33] <imode> fuck gemini.
[05:53:40] <imode> it gets no cookies.

[05:54:11] <dimadima> read it and weep
[05:54:18] <dimadima> motherfuckers
[05:54:19] <manicennui> So don't use that garbage.
[05:54:27] <dimadima> well that's easy to say
[05:54:31] <dimadima> lol
[05:54:39] <imode> what the fuck is capacitor.
[05:54:48] <dimadima> it's a wkwebview
[05:54:52] <imode> okay.
[05:54:58] <dimadima> for the purposes of this conversation
[05:54:58] <imode> so underneath it uses vkWebView
[05:55:07] <dimadima> the problem is with the wkwebview, not capacitor
[05:55:14] <imode> wait, why are you not using cordova.
[05:55:20] <imode> what the fuck is this thing.
[05:55:29] <manicennui> You'll never convince me that anything in the frontend world is good.
[05:55:32] <dimadima> cordova is, in fact, substantially inferior
[05:55:34] <manicennui> It's just piles of garbage.
[05:55:43] <dimadima> everything is a pile of garbage
[05:55:50] <manicennui> Not everything.
[05:55:51] <dimadima> you need to pick you pile of garage
[05:55:54] <dimadima> aka "stack"
[05:56:00] <manicennui> Some things are very nice, but lacking in some areas.
[05:56:08] <dimadima> let me guess
[05:56:10] <imode> so, in short, you picked the one shitty webview wrapper (which is not hard to build yourself for an actual basic webview, by the by) that doesn't implement cookies properly.
[05:56:16] <imode> cool.
[05:56:17] <dimadima> GWT?
[05:56:28] <dimadima> i didn't pick it, it picked me!
[05:56:34] <dimadima> truly
[05:56:39] <imode> use cordova, or.. write your own.
[05:56:39] <manicennui> I just said everything in the frontend world is garbage.
[05:56:40] <dimadima> life, you know, it happens
[05:56:54] <imode> what the fuck, so.
[05:56:54] <dimadima> i guess yeah that's how this started
[05:56:57] <imode> this thing is.
[05:57:06] <dimadima> does not send cookies properly
[05:57:07] <imode> fucking with the domain that the webview uses to resolve/fetch coookies.
[05:57:09] <imode> holy fuck.
[05:57:10] <manicennui> Green screens were the shit.
[05:57:13] <imode> how do you fuck that up.
[05:57:22] <dimadima> imode: it's apple's fault
[05:57:24] <dimadima> if you will
[05:57:30] <manicennui> I'm not convinced that the web is more usable than terminals for most work.
[05:57:30] <dimadima> i guess literally it is
[05:57:32] <imode> it looks like capacitor's fault.
[05:57:51] <dimadima> why?
[05:57:53] <imode> "Also can someone pray explain why document.cookie work on Cordova (maybe with a plugin mentioned in the very first post in this issue) and there isn't a problem with sync/async, but it is a problem with Capacitor?"
[05:57:55] <manicennui> The web is arguably better for a lot of things that we waste time on and hate ourselves for.
[05:57:59] <imode> because someone else did it correctly.
[05:58:09] <imode> otherwise, by definition, and by their dep tree, cordova would be broken too.
[05:58:10] <dimadima> imode: cordova uses UIWEbview
[05:58:16] <imode> okay?
[05:58:18] <dimadima> which is depretacted and is now being rejected automatically
[05:58:24] <dimadima> if you use the wkwebview cordova plugin
[05:58:27] <dimadima> you get this issue too
[05:58:37] <dimadima> it's all fucked
[05:58:40] <dimadima> totally fucked
[05:58:41] <imode> how many other alternative web views are there.
[05:58:45] <dimadima> none
[05:58:57] <imode> that's gotta be untrue.
[05:59:02] <manicennui> MS fucked up when they fucked around with trying to control the web.
[05:59:07] <dimadima> on iOS there's one webview
[05:59:08] <manicennui> They should have made VB for the web.
[05:59:14] <manicennui> And MS Access.
[05:59:15] <dimadima> and on android there's i don't
[05:59:18] <dimadima> i don't know*
[05:59:29] <dimadima>  MS Access should have gone somewhere but it didn't go anywhere
[05:59:33] <dimadima> very sad :(

[05:59:45] <dimadima> VB6 was my fav language
[05:59:49] <imode> also, the problem isn't "use JWT". it's "fix the fucking webview".
[06:00:00] <dimadima> listen i can't do that
[06:00:06] <dimadima> lol
[06:00:18] <imode> this dude did it.
[06:00:28] <dimadima> i'm ust saying sometimes you need to send your identity via a token that expires
[06:00:31] <dimadima> bada-bing JWT
[06:00:43] <dimadima> and it sucks
[06:00:53] <dimadima> what dude? who did it?
[06:01:00] <dimadima> no one fixed it cause it's fucked
[06:01:14] <imode> that link shows a cookie resolver.

[06:01:50] <dimadima> "First of all you will have to add the following to your capacitor.config.json"

[06:02:08] <dimadima> which autoamtically makes this not a fix
[06:02:40] <dimadima> yep
[06:02:42] <dimadima> i was trying to find that
[06:02:56] <imode> you wanna talk standards, cookies are a standard.
[06:03:04] <dimadima> this is probably the best solution https://github.com/capacitor-community/http
[06:03:04] <buttsbot> GitHub - capacitor-community/http: Community plugin for native HTTP
[06:03:09] <dimadima> as that comment comments
[06:03:11] <imode> and lo and behold, apple is the one falling short on their new webview implementation.
[06:03:30] <dimadima> apple just has this borked wkwebview
[06:03:30] <imode> I'll take them being shitty and the rest of the platforms being sane than JWT and its inherent design flaws.
[06:03:36] <dimadima> and they're fucking it on purpose
[06:03:40] <dimadima> cause they want native apps
[06:03:40] <imode> on purpose?
[06:03:43] <imode> bahahaha.
[06:03:44] <dimadima> that's my theory
[06:03:46] <imode> so don't release on apple.
[06:03:48] <dimadima> what the fuck is this bullshit
[06:03:52] <dimadima> next step: die
[06:04:00] <imode> fuck apple products and fuck iOS, dude.
[06:04:19] <imode> you can't ignore/coerce developers if we don't cooperate, why are you cooperating.
[06:04:20] <dimadima> i'm just trying to make a penny
[06:04:25] <imode> yeah, that's the root of it.
[06:04:48] <imode> I refuse to accept that we can lower our standards in the interest of getting shit done.
[06:04:48] <companion_cube> can't blame someone for an honest job
[06:04:53] <companion_cube> even if it involves terrible web tech
[06:05:10] <dimadima> < imode> I refuse to accept that we can lower our standards in the interest of getting shit done.
[06:05:23] <manicennui> I demand that dimadima live in a barrel on the street and yell at people.
[06:05:31] <imode> "WHERE'S MY WIFE?!"
[06:05:32] <dimadima> why me
[06:05:35] <dimadima> and not imode?
[06:05:40] <imode> already there my guy.
[06:05:42] <manicennui> dimadima: Sorry, you are the chosen one.

[06:08:24] <dimadima> unfair that i should be on the street when the polemic is all imode
[06:08:49] <dimadima> that guy in some straw in a barrel is not my scene
[06:08:54] <dimadima> i want more than straw bedding
[06:14:10] <manicennui> Imagine your tan though.

[06:15:08] <imode> just become a backend dev.

[06:15:27] <manicennui> I am now, but a lot of companies are all into this "full stack" nonsense.
[06:15:27] <imode> which IMO is even more wasteful than the web's connection model.
[06:15:42] <imode> yeah I tell anybody that's trying to poach me to fuck off if it's frontend.
[06:16:02] <imode> no patience for that, not an artist, unless you hand me a canvas to plot pixels on, I will not be doing it.
[06:16:05] <manicennui> "We want you to be bad at everything instead of good at one thing."
[06:16:36] <dimadima> backend is exceedingly more pleasant than frontend
[06:16:36] <imode> yes, because experts are hard to fire after you're done with them.
[06:16:49] <imode> one wonders why that is.
[06:16:59] <dimadima> one deployment target?
[06:17:04] <imode> nahhhhh.
[06:17:06] <imode> not even close.
[06:17:11] <dimadima> different interaction model
[06:17:36] <dimadima> UIs need to do all this stuff
[06:17:36] <imode> actually, frontend would be lovely, actually, if your model was an array of pixels that you could plot to from the server.
[06:17:52] <imode> along with an asset storage mechanism to play sounds, etc.
[06:18:02] <dimadima> why can't you plot them from the client?
[06:18:07] <manicennui> imode: I actually think that is the worst part about the frontend: The W3C has refused to anything sane for the last 20 years.
[06:18:21] <manicennui> Every new iteration of their standards they release is even more dumb.
[06:18:47] <imode> dimadima: why would I want to. have you seen what we did pre-web? we had servers as the authoritative controller of the dumb terminals that users used.
[06:18:49] <dimadima> https://github.com/Flipboard/react-canvas
[06:18:49] <buttsbot> GitHub - Flipboard/react-canvas: High performance <canvas> rendering for React components
[06:18:51] <imode> let's go back to that. it was far more fun.
[06:19:10] <dimadima> imode: what if you have many different devices to accommodate
[06:19:21] <dimadima> you have a terminfo type situation?
[06:19:31] <imode> it's almost like if you don't need a document layout engine, you can just query the height and width of the display.
[06:19:32] <manicennui> They've basically spent over 20 years refusing to do what everyone wanted, which was basically better table/grid layout.
[06:20:20] <dimadima> manicennui: flex/grid are here and so that's all over now thankfully
[06:20:30] <imode> 'but what about multiple devices' how the _fuck_ do you think every game developer on the planet gets by.
[06:20:32] <dimadima> imode: well i don't know enough about it
[06:20:41] <dimadima> imode: i don't know!
[06:21:21] <imode> that's the problem. the document model is all anybody ever thinks about because TBL and W3C like to keep thinking they're authors of the next printing press.
[06:21:34] <imode> pixels. work.
[06:21:46] <manicennui> Yeah.
[06:22:03] <dimadima> well i agree it would be great to not have the document model
[06:22:10] <manicennui> But it took them until recently to even give up on an even worse version of document layout.
[06:22:32] <manicennui> We need webcurses.
[06:23:12] <imode> you want to build an alternative to the web? here's an alternative to the web: server-controlled raster graphics, a clean API to draw primitives, an asset cache to call upon complex content at the server's discretion, long-lived TCP sessions.
[06:23:15] <manicennui> Obviously pixel-based layout would have allowed for all kinds of things.
[06:23:22] <imode> gemini is not a fucking alternative to the web.
[06:23:48] <imode> and fuck TBL.
[06:24:52] <imode> if it weren't for that right cunt we'd have a natural extension to existing BBS systems.
[06:25:03] <imode> among other parties involved.
[06:25:16] <imode> that and all of this memex hypertext bullshit.
[06:25:36] <imode> please keep your invented knowledge organization practices away from my colorful displays and real time media tech.
[06:25:45] <imode> we want none of what you're selling.
[06:26:34] <manicennui> I honestly think the UIs that you see in a lot of sci-fi movies would be far better.
[06:26:56] <manicennui> https://freight.cargo.site/t/original/i/e93902fc452250bc3ada30c50a7f0171ed759c2d5ae155cd7aedd514980525c6/01_OBLVN_Light_Table_UI_17br.jpg
[06:27:33] <imode> I like how, in the early days of the web, using practices that are now deprecated and laughed at, we actually tried to do some trivial "the web is like a pixel canvas" tricks to make pages render properly. the fact that those worked and still do really should tell you that we went in the wrong direction.
[06:27:57] <manicennui> Image maps?
[06:27:59] <imode> manicennui: looks like my setup sans conky.
[06:28:29] <imode> manicennui: manually telling the document renderer to adjust something to pixel values by giving it elements to skip over that don't do anything.
[06:28:40] <imode> there was a post about it on the orange site.
[06:28:52] <manicennui> That is form this page: https://gmunk.com/OBLIVION-GFX
[06:28:53] <buttsbot> .www | GMUNK
[06:28:57] <manicennui> From the movie Oblivion.
[06:29:00] <manicennui> Lot of cool stuff.
[06:29:16] <manicennui> s/form/from/
[06:29:19] <imode> notice how all of it is a uniform control surface.
[06:29:24] <imode> easy pz.
[06:29:56] <manicennui> And limited color palette.
[06:30:11] <manicennui> Much easier to make certain things stand out.
[06:30:42] <imode> tell me about it. my environment is 5 colors. 3 amber shades, red for errors/critical info, yellow for warnings.
[06:30:56] <companion_cube> imode: pixels work, but I keep hearing about accessibility
[06:31:00] <companion_cube> not something game devs have to think about
[06:31:00] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[06:31:59] <manicennui> I have a bunch of links to UIs I like.
[06:32:08] <imode> companion_cube: if you need text read aloud, there is _nothing_ stopping you from sending that text as something properly formatted. there's nothing preventing you from serving alternate content types via a very similar stream.
[06:32:32] <manicennui> It's interesting how sci-fi movie UIs tend to be very similar in that they are way better designed than actual computer UIs.
[06:32:41] <manicennui> The Expanse has decent looking UI design.
[06:32:56] <companion_cube> imode: but that's a strong point of the  document model
[06:33:02] <imode> that's not a strong point of anything.
[06:33:05] <imode> case in point: MUDs.
[06:33:16] <imode> there's no document model there.
[06:33:19] <companion_cube> also, game developers are typically dealing with 2d/3d worlds full of images and sound
[06:33:19] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏

[06:33:20] <buttsbot> The Expanse UI Design — HUDS+GUIS
[06:33:34] <companion_cube> MUDs are… like, older and more primitive than IRC
[06:33:39] <companion_cube> wtf buttsbot
[06:33:41] <imode> ...primitive, eh.
[06:33:44] <companion_cube> de√s
[06:33:57] <imode> they're incredibly attractive to blind players.
[06:33:59] <companion_cube> it's an IRC bot writer idea of a video game
[06:34:02] <companion_cube> sure
[06:34:05] <imode> wow.
[06:34:12] <imode> have you even played one.
[06:34:19] <companion_cube> but you can't talk about how game developers do multiplatform, and then use MUDs as an example
[06:34:24] <companion_cube> it's incredibly niche at this point
[06:34:24] <imode> actually, I can.
[06:34:45] <companion_cube> I mean it's like reducing all websites to wikipedia. http and html are *great* for wikipedia.
[06:34:53] <companion_cube> who needs anything else?
[06:35:04] <imode> there's a very large MUD development and player community, there are commercial developers with several MUDs released.
[06:35:17] <imode> and I can log into a MUD on every device I could own.
[06:35:21] <imode> and several that I don't.
[06:35:33] <imode> (that last part is down to permission issues.)
[06:35:54] <imode> there are graphical clients, there are terminal clients.
[06:36:07] <imode> there are even custom clients, with a very well-specified interface to tell your client to draw something graphical or not.
[06:36:15] <imode> leagues far beyond whatever the fuck a user agent is.
[06:36:17] <companion_cube> all that sounds exactly like IRC clients
[06:36:22] <companion_cube> that's cool and stuff, but, niche
[06:36:33] <imode> okay, then this entire server is niche.
[06:36:36] <companion_cube> (and yes, text makes it trivial to use anywhere, no discussion about that)
[06:36:39] <companion_cube> of course it is :D
[06:36:46] <companion_cube> I mena, it's fucking IRC in 2021
[06:36:48] <imode> I don't understand your argument other than to be a prick.
[06:36:53] <imode> which, seems character for you.
[06:36:59] <companion_cube> :D okay
[06:37:12] <companion_cube> I'm saying game de√s have to face other challenges when it comes to portability
[06:37:24] <imode> we were talking about accessability. a blind player can't play call of duty.
[06:37:29] <companion_cube> and that they're not even a good analogy to what web devs have to do
[06:37:31] <companion_cube> yep
[06:37:37] <companion_cube> and most games don't care about accessibility
[06:37:38] <manicennui> imode: Lucky for them.
[06:37:38] <imode> a blind player can't play any graphical game.
[06:37:41] <companion_cube> yep
[06:37:43] <companion_cube> exactly my point
[06:37:53] <imode> I don't get your point.
[06:38:01] <imode> I don't think there is one.
[06:38:03] <companion_cube> the "games are portable, why don't web devs draw pixels the same way" totally ignores that games are not accessible
[06:38:03] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[06:38:15] <companion_cube> because most games are not accessible and are not meant to be
[06:38:19] <companion_cube> that was my point.
[06:38:21] <manicennui> It will always bring me great joy that the best selling video game of all time is one that "gamers" hate.
[06:38:35] <companion_cube> (and yes, MUDs are accessible, but, they're a niche kind of game)
[06:38:42] <manicennui> And most of the top ten are not games that "gamers" like much.
[06:39:04] <imode> okay, separating the two sides of the brain for a moment, the document model is not accessible. at all. your screen reader had to go from reading words on a page to parsing out the structure of a document and hoping that it got it right, which is not an easily testable accomplishment other than listening to the fucking thing.
[06:39:17] <imode> your entire input space got leagues larger and 10x more complex for no upsides other than it looks good as a newspaper printout.
[06:39:32] <companion_cube> it's more accessible than "pixels"
[06:39:37] <companion_cube> not saying it's great, but at least it's a document
[06:39:47] <companion_cube> (SPAs are… not great, for sure)
[06:39:52] <imode> I'm not arguing that it should all be pixels. I'm saying that you can do better graphical web design in a much simpler fashion _if you just treat the thing as a fucking pixel canvas_.
[06:40:12] <imode> though, now that you've got me started, I'll ramble a bit more: why are we syncing up visual and textual representations of a subject matter anyway.
[06:40:23] <companion_cube> how is it not just drawing pixels
[06:41:06] <imode> okay, let's assume that grandma needs to file some application online. she's legally blind. she should have the opportunity to use a screen reader and a visual form at the same time.
[06:41:30] <imode> why does the visual information to convey this need to be coupled to the textual information to convey this.
[06:41:33] <companion_cube> I think that'd be great, to have custom accessible APIs
[06:41:44] <imode> why do they need to be coupled together under the same API, same container format, etc.
[06:41:54] <companion_cube> in theory that's html + css, no?
[06:41:56] <imode> the reason I brought up MUDs is that this is a solved problem for at least 40 years.
[06:42:06] <imode> they actually do separate content streams.
[06:42:10] <companion_cube> I'd love to read more on the UIs for these, tbh
[06:42:19] <companion_cube> I'm more familiar with rogue likes
[06:42:32] <imode> thaaaaat explains a lot, roguelike UIs suck shit through a straw.
[06:42:41] <companion_cube> depends which ones, but oftentimes yes
[06:42:55] <imode> I chalk that up to "it is hard to do UIs with ncurses".
[06:43:10] <companion_cube> my favorite rogue like was based on SDL :)
[06:43:16] <companion_cube> it had light effects!! wooo
[06:43:19] <imode> bahahaha.
[06:43:28] <imode> I remember playing brogue and it was just like.
[06:43:31] <imode> "what the hell is that".
[06:44:40] <imode> so there are several side-channel protocols.
[06:44:41] <imode> https://mudhalla.net/tintin/protocols/msdp/
[06:44:41] <buttsbot> MSDP (Mud Server Data Protocol)
[06:45:27] <imode> and your MUD client of choice knows how to respect and request that these protocols be used.
[06:46:09] <imode> the parser is simple, it allows for scripting.
[06:47:42] <imode> having a primary representation and then alternative secondary representations available as streams from an authoritative source is better than "I will rely on a browser layout engine to mangle this in the right way for both my blind and sighted viewers".
[06:47:56] <companion_cube> but where's the graphical part?
[06:48:37] <imode> there are screenshots near the bottom.
[06:48:47] <companion_cube> yeah, almost missed them with the bad UI
[06:48:55] <imode> yeah. lmao.
[06:48:57] <companion_cube> http://www.godwars2.org/images/tintin_thai.png <--- seems pretty close to nethack
[06:49:00] <imode> http://www.godwars2.org/images/plugin_v115_6.png
[06:49:17] <companion_cube> so it's still text based?
[06:49:24] <manicennui> My friend interviewed this developer for a popular commercial MUD: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c8LI_1wmIs
[06:49:25] <buttsbot> Advent of the Mists / Interview with Crystal Groves - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c8LI_1wmIs
[06:49:26] <imode> yeah. you navigate via commands.
[06:49:34] <imode> but you can bind those to UI actions.
[06:49:39] <companion_cube> I mean, the UI is also text
[06:49:49] <imode> ehhh.
[06:50:20] <imode> https://www.ironrealms.com/
[06:50:21] <buttsbot> Iron Realms Entertainment – Iron Realms is the world's leading creator of MUDs.
[06:51:27] <imode> you're meant to read, you're not meant to exclusively use a terminal interface.
[06:51:48] <imode> if I could make the comparison, the web loves to adopt new things, MUDs love to slowly grow old things.
[06:52:53] <imode> going back to the root of this point, it's that this is doing accessability in this manner far better than the web is doing right now, so I don't and never have seen a compelling argument for the document model that couldn't be beat by "have multiple presentation methods each with their own content stream".
[06:53:29] <companion_cube> what would that look like for, well, a classic document? to go back to the historical root
[06:53:50] <companion_cube> why does a wikipedia page need several streams to mix formatted text, and some pictures/audio snippets?
[06:54:29] <companion_cube> in a way it does what you say: images and sound are distinct URLs with their own mime type, and they have a placeholder with a text description
[06:54:32] <imode> why are we considering wikipedia to be a page instead of an encyclopedia application served to your dumb terminal over a TCP/IP connection.
[06:54:36] <companion_cube> alt="ab albatross"
[06:54:45] <companion_cube> I mean a given wikipedia page.
[06:54:54] <imode> again, why are we considering that.
[06:54:57] <companion_cube> well it doesb't fit in a "terminal"
[06:55:03] <companion_cube> pictures, videos, audio
[06:55:12] <imode> who says? you have a pixel canvas.
[06:55:20] <imode> not a terminal.
[06:55:31] <companion_cube> sure, then you need good text rendering and really really good text layout
[06:55:35] <imode> I say dumb terminal because it's the closest thing I have to "server tells you what the hell to render".
[06:55:42] <companion_cube> I personally don't wish to implement that
[06:55:45] <companion_cube> and you need reflow
[06:55:50] <companion_cube> since every person has their own device size
[06:56:00] <imode> sure. we've had UI frameworks for decades now.
[06:56:18] <companion_cube> all we need is a portable, universal, remote-commanded UI framework!
[06:56:20] <companion_cube> aka the graal
[06:56:37] <companion_cube> aka, well, the thing that the web is the closest (shitty) version of
[06:56:41] <companion_cube> this is why electron is a thing
[06:57:03] <imode> why are you assuming that a single UI framework should dominate what I display to my users.
[06:57:15] <imode> that's how all of this bullshit started.
[06:57:26] <companion_cube> pick your argument
[06:57:37] <companion_cube> users choose? or ship pixels?
[06:57:42] <companion_cube> that's kind of the opposite
[06:57:47] <imode> bruh.
[06:58:03] <imode> it's always been "users choose". and if users choose graphical, my god, I'd rather a canvas.
[06:58:16] <companion_cube> and then you have to do a whole layour engine yourself
[06:58:18] <companion_cube> on top of the canvas
[06:58:22] <companion_cube> layout*
[06:58:29] <companion_cube> + rendering fonts and all that shit
[06:58:43] <imode> yeah, because all of those game developers really write a font library before rendering text.
[06:58:43] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[06:58:46] <companion_cube> (heh, games are typically super bad at fonts. They have one and that's it)
[06:59:22] <companion_cube> have you seen SDL? there isn't even support for *fonts* in it, unless you bring it a third party addon
[06:59:27] <companion_cube> and the web started in the 90s
[06:59:51] <imode> does that somehow preclude me from doing font rendering?
[07:00:13] <manicennui> I can't decide whether I want a media room in my cottage in the woods.
[07:00:23] <manicennui> I'm tempted to just give up television and movies.
[07:00:37] <imode> you do realize that something had to be written somewhere sometime, right. browser vendors don't exactly write their own font handling.
[07:00:49] <imode> unless I missed something and they're entirely free-standing monoliths.
[07:01:02] <imode> I had to install _some_ shared libraries when I installed my browser.
[07:01:10] <manicennui> imode: Arguably Apple did.
[07:01:14] <imode> fuck apple.
[07:01:16] <manicennui> And MS.
[07:01:23] <companion_cube> browsers do a shitton of stuff
[07:01:30] <imode> yes, most of it imported from elsewhere.
[07:01:32] <companion_cube> most of us don't even know how to do 1% of what a browser does
[07:01:44] <imode> import libraries that do my job for me? hell yeah I do.
[07:01:46] <companion_cube> so, the browser is that UI framework you talk about
[07:01:54] <companion_cube> with RPC
[07:02:07] <companion_cube> and this fucking weird split brain mechanism where half the code is on a server and half on the client
[07:02:10] <companion_cube> whch is insane
[07:02:24] <companion_cube> but still, it's the one UI framework that does everything and works basically everywhere
[07:02:30] <companion_cube> and I hate it, but I see why it won
[07:02:40] <imode> yeah, because nobody stepped up and said "this is a bad idea" early on.
[07:02:48] <imode> we were enamored with hypertext.
[07:03:04] <imode> and the memex.
[07:03:38] <imode> what was that thing that nut was talking about building as the ur-hypertext solution. xanadu.
[07:04:01] <imode> ted nelson! that's his name.
[07:04:24] <imode> the web is halfway between a BBS and Xanadu.
[07:04:28] <imode> and personally I'd rather a BBS.
[07:04:52] <companion_cube> I think it's a tragedy the web is subsuming everything (like, NNTP didn't have to die)
[07:04:56] <companion_cube> but that's just evolution
[07:05:04] <imode> that's cancer, not evolution.
[07:05:43] <manicennui> We love bad ideas.
[07:05:48] <manicennui> Like blockchain.
[07:05:54] <manicennui> And AWS.
[07:05:55] <Xe> this sentence makes you breathe manually
[07:06:03] <imode> this sentence counters the previous sentence.
[07:06:21] <companion_cube> this sentence makes you blink
[07:06:28] <imode> this sentence makes you think!
[07:06:31] <manicennui> I didn't blink.
[07:06:37] <manicennui> This sentence makes you yawn.
[07:06:38] <companion_cube> ohno
[07:06:46] <companion_cube> this sentence makes you do the dishes
[07:06:49] <companion_cube> (hoping it works for me)
[07:06:53] <imode> jokes on you, already did 'em.
[07:07:03] <Xe> holy fuck why do 4,000 people follow me on twitter
[07:07:55] <imode> 'cuz you're awesome.
[07:08:16] <companion_cube> fur the luz
[07:08:19] <companion_cube> lulz*
[07:13:28] <manicennui> I love the way a-frames look, but the shape creates a bit of dead space inside.
[07:13:38] <manicennui> And if they aren't insulated correctly, it isn't easy to fix.
[07:13:49] <imode> build yerself a proper log cabin, a-frames are always temporary dwellings.
[07:14:52] <manicennui> Why do you say that?
[07:14:58] <dimadima> Xe: this is good content http://ix.io/3IjW
[07:15:14] <companion_cube> manicennui: subsumed by B frames, then C frames, then C++ frames
[07:15:27] <imode> then C# frames, then F# frames.
[07:16:15] <imode> manicennui: just that log cabins provide their own form of insulation, are more stable and weather-harty. source: lived in one for many years.
[07:17:09] <manicennui> Why is there no E language?

[07:17:30] <manicennui> imode: A-frames are supposed to be good for snow, and as long as they are insulted properly, they should be good generally.
[07:17:48] <manicennui> Well then.
[07:18:09] <imode> they distribute weight, yes. but they aren't practical in terms of space, and you don't need to insulate a log cabin.
[07:18:19] <dimadima> well
[07:18:20] <dimadima> The E language is designed with secure computing in mind; this is accomplished chiefly by strict adherence to the object-oriented computing model, which in its pure form has properties that support secure computing.
[07:18:31] <companion_cube> imode: you say that
[07:18:34] <Xe> dimadima: honestly i'd rather distribute the things that get past buttflare so that researchers can be informed
[07:18:41] <companion_cube> but look at what happened to the log4j cabin
[07:18:46] <companion_cube> not enough insulation, is what
[07:18:50] <imode> bahahahahahha.
[07:19:01] <imode> that hit me today, actually.
[07:19:17] <imode> well, not me, but the people around me. I never explicitly declared a dependency on log4j.
[07:19:34] <companion_cube> you got bitten by the bid bad transitivity

[07:19:43] <buttsbot> SLF4J - Wikipedia
[07:19:49] <imode> not even that. lambda uses this.
[07:20:02] <imode> or our "things you slot into lambda framework" uses this.
[07:20:46] <imode> saved my ass, because everything I write doesn't have to be fancy, or use custom emitters.
[07:20:51] <imode> or appenders.
[07:21:56] <manicennui> Can we get back to pure OO being secure?
[07:22:36] <companion_cube> wouldn't have happened in haskell, just sayin'
[07:23:21] <manicennui> E's runtime sounds interesting.
[07:23:46] <imode> what part of haskell says you can't load code from external resources and run it. :P
[07:24:04] <manicennui> imode: The part where no one writes any Haskell.
[07:24:06] * manicennui ducks
[07:26:08] <manicennui> "Original-E, a set of extensions to Java for secure distributed programming"
[07:26:11] <imode> I had a dude vehemently declaring that he can become a AAA gamedev via haskell, and convince major game studios to use haskell.
[07:26:40] <imode> he couldn't write a render loop.
[07:27:15] <manicennui> Real games are written in lisp.
[07:28:24] <imode> apparently death road to canada is written entirely in a custom forth!
[07:28:29] <imode> and it's a commercial game!
[07:28:33] <imode> on steam 'n everything!
[07:28:59] <imode> and the switch!
[07:29:08] <manicennui> Naughty Dog has actually written custom lisps that they used for multiple super popular games.
[07:29:15] <imode> yeh, GOAL.
[07:29:23] <imode> lotta that stuff in the jak and daxter games.
[07:29:43] <manicennui> And I forget which company basically embedded a scheme in some popular game.
[07:30:50] <imode> I don't think Crash Bandicoot was GOAL.
[07:30:56] <imode> but I know the jak games were.
[07:31:37] <manicennui> It is GOOL
[07:31:43] <manicennui> They have a couple different lisps.
[07:32:07] <manicennui> https://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/03/12/making-crash-bandicoot-gool-part-9/
[07:32:07] <buttsbot> Making Crash Bandicoot – GOOL – part 9 :: All Things Andy Gavin
[07:32:21] <imode> oh shit.
[07:32:43] <manicennui> And apparently they are the ones embedding Racket now.
[07:32:47] <manicennui> For scripting games.
[07:33:12] <imode> seriously? I thought they stopped that with uncharted.
[07:33:41] <imode> so GOOL is compiled... not surprised, I would be more surprised if they ran even half a full env on the PS1.

[07:34:16] <manicennui> Not sure whether they stopped.
[07:34:16] <imode> daaaamn.
[07:34:32] <manicennui> But they were doing it in 2013 apparently.
[07:34:35] <imode> naughty dog has a lisp fetish.
[07:35:07] <companion_cube> imode: the part where ideally a log function wouldn't do too much :D
[07:35:09] <companion_cube> I was mostly kidding
[07:35:12] <manicennui> Slides: https://con.racket-lang.org/2013/danl-slides.pdf
[07:35:27] <companion_cube> I was thinking of the hashCode of URL making DNS queries. That shit would definitely not fly.
[07:35:31] <imode> hahaha.
[07:35:50] <manicennui> I bet your logging library doesn't even use blockchain.
[07:36:26] <imode> I wonder how much of this is used now... that'd be impressive.
[07:36:44] <manicennui> You could use something like Janet today.
[07:37:09] <manicennui> Or fennel embedded in your engine.
[07:37:26] <imode> "S-expression based language a tough sell"
[07:37:37] <imode> "you'll use it and like it" - Naughty Dog and Amazon, apparently.
[07:37:40] <manicennui> I see that as a good thing.
[07:37:46] <manicennui> I want to use things that aren't popular.
[07:37:55] <imode> https://amzn.github.io/ion-docs/ go use this then
[07:37:56] <buttsbot> Amazon Ion
[07:38:13] <manicennui> No commercial shit.
[07:38:29] <imode> bUt It'S fOsS
[07:38:54] <manicennui> I'll use EDN!
[07:39:24] <manicennui> I seriously want to explore this idea I had earlier.
[07:39:32] <manicennui> Of somehow writing software to support myself.
[07:39:40] <manicennui> Without being in constant contact with anyone.
[07:39:57] <manicennui> I'll start the Slow Software Movement.
[07:41:56] <manicennui> Some of the commercial MUDs make enough to support their creators, which is surprising.
[07:44:56] <companion_cube> S-expressions are a decent serialization format :)
[07:45:11] <companion_cube> certainly one that is nicer to handwrite than json, anyway.
[07:54:14] <manicennui> When you discover the power of lisp it is basically like the scene near the end of The Matrix where Neo stops the bullets.
[07:54:30] <manicennui> "No."
[07:54:39] <manicennui> And all of the shitty ALGOL inspired code falls away.
[07:54:47] <companion_cube> y'all keep saying that :)
[07:55:14] <manicennui> companion_cube: You are basically Cypher.
[07:55:45] <companion_cube> I do have some facial pilosity *and* some baldness
[07:55:56] <manicennui> heh
[07:56:13] * manicennui puts companion_cube back in the matrix.
[07:56:14] <companion_cube> I hope imode isn't reading anymore cause he'd explode
[07:56:23] <companion_cube> but anyway, lisps are too powerful for my wee brain
[07:56:28] <companion_cube> I need assistance from the computer ;)

[07:58:26] <manicennui> Can't think of anything recently that compares.
[07:58:31] <manicennui> For action movies.
[07:59:39] <manicennui> I hope the new movie doesn't suck.

[18:21:48] <Brekkjern> The second one was decent
[18:22:38] <ngoldbaum> the unreal engine 5 tech demo was pretty impressive
[18:22:47] <ngoldbaum> it looked prerendered
[18:23:06] <companion_cube> does the unreal thing mean that half the film, taking place in the matrix, is rendered by unreal engine?
[18:25:35] <manicennui> Do you think that the jacks that they put in their heads are a future version of Oculus?

Lioness claims to be the first whistleblower organization to help fund itself through the use of such NFTs.”
[18:40:38] <ngoldbaum> way to smash your credibility
[18:41:49] <gwozniak> ffs
[18:47:04] <manicennui> This is the worst timeline.
[18:48:04] <manicennui> How much more absurd will it become?
[18:48:53] <manicennui> Also, why isn't Trump all over these scams?
[18:49:03] <manicennui> He should have his own coin and NFTs.
[18:51:10] <manicennui> Convert all of your currency to TrumpCoin to fight the Deep State!!!!
[18:52:44] <gerikson> he's too dumb for NFTs and he realizes his marks are too
[18:54:52] <companion_cube> trump is not even a good scammer
[18:55:01] <companion_cube> if he were, he'd have sold trump masks in 2020
[18:55:04] <companion_cube> and got actually rich, but no
[18:55:09] <gerikson> he can't help but make money
[18:55:29] <gwozniak> the best
[18:55:55] <manicennui> companion_cube: Would they have breathing holds in them?
[18:56:04] <companion_cube> hopefully not
[18:56:09] <ngoldbaum> he’s doing fine grifting via traditional finance and his SPAC
[18:59:39] <gerikson> zactly
[18:59:46] <gerikson> he can grift legally
[18:59:50] <gerikson> no need to go NFT

[19:01:34] <buttsbot> Twitter - a24 - New year, new universe.  Watch the trailer for EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE, an epic sci-fi/kung fu adventure from mad geniuse...
[19:01:43] <ngoldbaum> ^ this looks cool
[19:03:01] <gerikson> manicennui: yeah but you need to disclose gains/losses
[19:03:08] <gerikson> guess if anyone does
[19:03:14] <manicennui> "and Jamie Lee Curtis"
[19:03:15] <manicennui> heh
[19:03:22] <manicennui> I like her, but in a kung fu movie?
[19:03:54] <manicennui> I'll have to watch the trailer in a bit.
[19:06:35] <gerikson> she gets paid, I am ok
[19:07:13] <manicennui> Oh, it is a Daniels movie.
[19:07:33] <manicennui> Swiss Army Man is great.
[19:07:49] <manicennui> So I assume this is a messed up comedy.
[19:08:12] * manicennui waits for meeting to end.
[19:08:32] <ngoldbaum> it looks like a comedy-action movie
[19:08:43] <ngoldbaum> and i really liked michelle yoh in star trek discovery
[19:08:44] <Church> Yeah it's A24 I'm down
[19:08:58] <Church> Shit I should go rewatch The Green Knight again
[19:08:59] <manicennui> Michelle Yeoh is great.
[19:09:15] <Church> I only saw that movie like 5 times in theaters?
[19:09:33] <manicennui> She was the only tolerable part of Gunpowder Milkshake.
[19:09:47] <manicennui> Church: I only saw it once, but didn't fully understand it until I read more about it.
[19:10:01] <manicennui> I'm not super familiar with the Arthurian legends.
[19:10:09] <Church> Yeah you need to be up on Arthurian legends for it to make sense
[19:10:25] <Church> Which is why it was such a big treat to get all that actual Arthurian weirdness.
[19:10:27] <manicennui> I still want to see Lamb.
[19:19:34] <manicennui> Friend just sent me this: https://www.templedao.link/

[19:19:48] <manicennui> One of his other friends is pushing it.
[19:34:30] <manicennui> Movie looks weird. I like it.
[19:36:09] <manicennui> Jamie Lee Curtis' character looks hilarious.
[19:36:17] <manicennui> Jamie Lee Curtis as a villainous bureaucrat
[19:38:26] <gwozniak> Yeah, that looks like something I'll enjoy
[19:43:37] <pja> You know anthing A24 produces is going to be /interesting/.
[19:43:51] <pja> Not necessarily great, but definitely weird & interesting in a good way.
[19:46:33] <manicennui> Neon is pretty similar, although some of their films are just really indie.
[19:46:49] <manicennui> I recommend Titane if you haven't seen it and like fucked up movies.

[21:19:20] <Brekkjern> river: Wasn't stuxnet partly a supply chain attack?
[21:19:27] <river> yeah
[21:19:47] <river> that's a great example, although I am mostly wondering about stuff that happened in the free software community
[21:20:33] <epilys> stuxnet was "incredible"
[21:20:50] <epilys> forgetting about morality and politics, it was impressive

[21:36:37] <dimadima> ivermectin
[21:36:42] <dimadima> wtf happened to hydroxy
[21:37:47] <manicennui> It's all bullshit.
[21:37:57] <dimadima> i thought it was real
[21:38:01] <manicennui> They just move from drug to drug.
[21:38:29] <dimadima> me, personally, i trust my immune system
[21:38:41] <manicennui> There seems to be a good chance that ivermectin "works" in countries where a large portion of the population has parasites.
[21:38:42] <dimadima> that's the kind of relationship we have
[21:38:47] <dimadima> heh
[21:38:51] <manicennui> Meaning it is taking care of another problem which helps people fight covid.
[21:38:54] <dimadima> The South?
[21:39:01] <manicennui> No, other countries.
[21:39:04] <dimadima> ;)
[21:39:19] <dimadima> that was a reference to the depression-era parasites in the south tihng
[21:39:20] <companion_cube> the inventor got a nobel prize in medicine after all
[21:39:30] <manicennui> If that is what is happening, it is far less likely to do anything for most Americans.
[21:39:31] <dimadima> the inventor what
[21:39:55] <dimadima> sometimes parasites can be good for you in unexpected ways
[21:40:02] <dimadima> like tapeworms and allergies
[21:41:28] <manicennui> Plus you always have a friend in your intestines.
[21:41:39] <manicennui> Never alone.
[21:42:05] <dimadima> my mom had a tapeworm one summer in her early 20s
[21:42:16] <manicennui> Remember those poorly drawn reddit memes?
[21:42:21] <dimadima> the USSR had poor infrastructure

[21:48:15] <manicennui> I especially like the "me gusta" and "y u no" memes.
[21:49:04] <manicennui> Those memes are kind of like emojis.
[21:49:14] <manicennui> You can respond to most things with one of them.
[21:50:17] <manicennui> Lot of bicycle delivery people now. I wonder if there is a temperature at which they stop.

[21:51:49] <manicennui> Not a lot of new info, but there is one point he makes that is interesting and obvious in hindsight.
[21:52:09] <manicennui> If you make things yourself, there are a lot of foods you won't eat very often because they are too much of a pain.
[21:52:16] <manicennui> Like potato chips.
[21:52:37] <manicennui> But we can eat them every day if we buy them.

[22:01:03] <gwozniak> Making your own meals is great, tbh
[22:01:14] <manicennui> I agree, but I'm *really* lazy.
[22:01:19] <gwozniak> Just time consuming to do every day
[22:01:20] <manicennui> I know I need to change.
[22:01:30] <manicennui> I actually have plenty of time.

[22:16:07] <imode> gooood  morning.
[22:16:12] <dimadima> gooood morning imode
[22:17:06] <river> :) hi
[22:20:47] <epilys> good mornings!
[22:31:14] <imode> how're we all today.
[22:33:54] <companion_cube> o/
[22:34:03] <companion_cube> ready for some non constructive debate, imode?
[22:34:40] <epilys> I'm out of ritalin so I told my client I have a minor medical problem and won't be able to work for 2 days :x
[22:36:07] <dimadima> what will you do in the mean time
[22:37:01] <epilys> Work on my side projects; they don't require constant attention
[22:37:36] <epilys> except for my book I started writing a screen ruler/protractor in gtk + rust a few days ago
[22:37:40] <imode> companion_cube: I am _always_ ready.
[22:37:43] <imode> :P
[22:37:50] <epilys> it's useful for measuring stuff in PDFs for typography stuff
[22:38:01] <imode> epilys: you always tend to have really interesting side projects.
[22:38:42] <epilys> thank you, i always think they are only interesting for me
[22:39:19] <imode> nahhh.

[23:52:55] <imode> excuse me WHAT.
[23:52:57] <imode> WHAT
[23:53:02] <imode> oh FUCK OFF.
[23:57:26] <pja> imode: Yeah. It’s a whole thing :(
[23:57:48] <imode> will this shit just end.
[23:57:57] <pja> Yes, Kickstarter, I’m sure your users are /dying/ to switch to the new fund raising method where each transaction incurrs $50 in fees.
[23:58:01] <pja> fuckers.
[23:58:24] <imode> like, is this a fad. please tell me it's just a fad and it'll pass and we'll go back to normal eventually.
[23:58:26] <pja> Maybe they’re going to use Tether & keep that shadow bank going?
[23:58:35] <river> unfortunately it's not going away
[23:58:40] <pja> imode: It’s a fad. But it’s going to run for at least another decade.
[23:58:48] <imode> I fucking hate the internet.
[23:58:50] <river> and the fine folks of ##crustaceans will also never stop going on about it
[23:59:06] <river> ngl i wouldn't even know what hacker news or an NFT is if it weren't for yall
[23:59:16] <imode> I'd stop going on about it _if it stopped polluting everything_.
[23:59:35] <pja> It’s also an interesting example of bubbles. All except one of the programmer / IT people I know range from dislike to outright disdain for crypto-currencies.
[23:59:44] <pja> Yet it’s pulled in huge numbers of tech-types.
[23:59:48] <imode> they probably own some.
[23:59:53] <imode> "just to be safe".
