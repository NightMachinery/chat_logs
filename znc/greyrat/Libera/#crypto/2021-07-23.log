[00:21:08] <replayer> do CAs need to publish that information ? i know there are ct logs, but are there any exceptions?
[00:22:53] <Peng> 1.) No. 2.) Sure, probably.
[00:24:10] <MacGyver> I think they do?
[00:24:23] <MacGyver> Browser/CA forum mandates CT nowadays, does it not?
[00:24:40] <replayer> but that is only browser related , no ?
[00:27:03] <MacGyver> No?
[00:27:13] <ms7821> the question was about websites
[00:27:14] <MacGyver> And even if it were, you did ask for *websites* signed by a CA.
[00:27:43] <MacGyver> So the only sensible way to parse that is "all domains signed by a CA playing in the web PKI".
[00:27:46] <MacGyver> Which is that.
[00:27:50] <Peng> Browsers/OSes will only trust certificates that are logged, but certificates are not required to be logged. If you want to run a website that no one can visit, you can.
[00:28:10] <replayer> lets extend the question to non websites too :)
[00:28:17] <ms7821> or if you run your own PKI hierarchy and can install that cert on client machines
[00:28:26] <ms7821> (but I'd usually consider that a corner case)
[00:30:14] <ms7821> so to answer the extended question, if you run your own CA, then there's no standard way that I know of to view the certs signed by it
[00:30:37] <replayer> but for official CAs ?
[00:30:48] <ms7821> what's your *actual* question?
[00:31:54] <ms7821> if it's "are there certs in webpki that aren't in CT?", the answer is no, since a couple of weeks ago

[00:32:31] <ms7821> if it's "can a well-known CA issue certs outside webpki and therefore CT?", then yes, there are legacy intermediates that are still used
[00:33:08] <replayer> for how long? and what is webpki ?  just browsers ?
[00:35:11] <replayer> also: well-know = the usual suspects in the cert store ?
[00:35:41] <ms7821> I don't know, is that what you care about?

[00:46:28] <Peng> :D
[00:46:42] <Peng> Sometimes those get backported!
[00:55:35] <Peng> Ubuntu appears to be pretty good -- but probably not perfect -- about updating ca-certificates now.
[00:56:38] <Peng> Debian added DST Root CA X3 in like 2008-05, IIRC it was in Ubuntu 8.10 but only got backported it to Ubuntu 8.04 in like 2012. But ca-certificates gets updated pretty often now. :D
[00:57:01] <sarnold> yeah it's quite a bit more frequent these days
[01:12:06] <onelegend> I wonder if a third party laptop seller can just modify the certificates
[01:12:12] <onelegend> *root certificates
[01:12:36] <wasamasa> lenovo once included a bad root cert
[01:12:40] <onelegend> well that sucks

[19:59:32] <Haohmaru> pics or it didn't happen
[20:00:22] <Alipha> for every bit, you generate 128 bits of randomness to correspond to the bit being 1 and 128 bits of randomness to correspond to the bit being 0. so this one-time pad is 256x longer than the message to be encrypted. then the encryptor, when encrypting a message, for each bit, select either the 128 bits corresponding to the 1 bit or the 128 bits corresponding to the 0 bit, depending upon if the plaintext bit is
[20:00:25] <Alipha> 1 or 0. this results in a ciphertext that's 128x longer, but an attacker cannot modify any single bit of the ciphertext without better than a 2^128 chance of being valid, without access to the one time pad

[22:40:08] <onelegend> I'm thinking of layering one time pasd on top of something like signal
[22:41:14] <woggle> I wouldn't call something generated from a seed a one-time pad as it lacks the fundamental inconvenience and theoretical security of one-time pads.
[22:41:26] <onelegend> scratch the seed then
[22:41:44] <onelegend> just meet up with the person in real life, exchange a dozen of one time pads or so, and then layer that on top of signal

[22:48:09] *** Joins: byteskeptical (~amnesia@user/byteskeptical)
[22:48:51] <onelegend> woggle: your statement is incorrect. What I described is still the one time pad.
[22:49:53] <onelegend> It's may not be a properly implemented one time pad, but it is still by definition a one time pad. The messages are still be XOR'd with different temporary keys

[22:52:53] <MacGyver> That's just a direct result of what the one-time pad *is*.
[22:53:33] <MacGyver> I wonder whether anyone still flies over military planes filled to the brim with tapes.
[22:53:40] <onelegend> they could've just said "theoretical security" no?
[22:54:02] <MacGyver> They could've, but what they said is not wrong.
[22:54:15] <int-e> but that sounds like there is no actual security
[22:54:31] <MacGyver> Any attempt to make a OTP more convenient by using seeds and then generating the keystream makes it *not a OTP*.
[22:55:02] <onelegend> would it be realistic for people meeting in real life to add an extra layer of security through one time pads?
[22:55:03] <woggle> The "theoretical security" I was referring to was meant to be short-hand for something like "information-theoretic security".

[22:56:48] <MacGyver> int-e: All the more reason to nip these things in the bud.

[22:57:15] <onelegend> fair
[22:57:24] <woggle> I think the inconvenience is important to point out because there's a good reason almost no one uses OTPs in serious contexts.
