[00:00:39] <jbis> johnnyapol yeah not ideal
[00:01:15] <Pentode> nothing wrong with the way jbis is going about it. especially if the application is a cross-platform one. you also don't have to worry about mismatched pipes and stuffs..
[00:01:47] <jbis> Apple does this with a bunch of their applications. I just don't know how they do it,
[00:02:02] <zamnedix> jbis, you say you dont want to create a situation where the user can start running whatever commands you want, then you say you want it to run "just about anything the user wants". which is it? what are your actual requirements?
[00:02:17] <johnnyapol> i think they want only their driver program to be issuing commands
[00:02:31] <johnnyapol> so that its not just a blinking neon sign for privilege escalation

[00:04:38] <johnnyapol> polkit is pretty much designed for this unprvileged / privileged architecture. for example, its dispatched if you try to change firewall settings or global systemd services https://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/docs/master/polkit.8.html
[00:04:44] <jbis> zamnedix I can give you big picture. The app is basically a backup app. It uses rsync. But the user has the ability to run prebackup scripts, postbackup scripts, etc.

[01:07:32] <akoana> carlino3: also clonezilla can save (and restore) only used blocks in the hard disk
[01:07:33] <Dagmar> carlino3: Yeah.  Tar was originally designed literally to backup entire filesystems to tapes, so it doesn't really need to be told a whole lot other than "that directory goes into this file" unless you're dealing with extended ACLs or something bizarre
[01:07:53] <carlino3> i see
[01:08:00] <Dagmar> I use dd through gzip.
[01:08:18] <Dagmar> The only time I bother with tar is if I plan on later modifying that backup
[01:08:43] <carlino3> i guess that dd solution should be faster, right?
[01:09:04] <jim> there are other backup solutions, for example borg backup works pretty well (there's a learning curve though)

[13:33:56] <terminalpusher> Isn't there a way to tell `rm -rf` to always put those (possibly accidentally) deleted files into the trash?
[13:34:11] <mlu> terminalpusher: why would you want to do that?
[13:34:16] <terminalpusher> `rm` does not seem to put stuff into the trash bin but just delete it
[13:34:18] <koollman> not that I know of. But, you could use mv instead
[13:34:18] <mlu> terminalpusher: especially with the f, you mean it
[13:34:25] <koollman> rm has no notion of trash
[13:34:29] <gry> does linux eg debian have parental controls. like a user cannot login if a parent's password is not entered
[13:34:37] <mlu> terminalpusher: many people have aliases `rm` to `rm -i`
[13:34:52] <mlu> gry: define parental controls

[13:35:07] <mlu> gry: ah, don't tell the kid the password and they can't log in
[13:35:13] <terminalpusher> mlu: how can I do that?
[13:35:15] <mlu> great, it's just a regular account
[13:35:24] <mlu> terminalpusher: google up 'alias rm to rm -i in bash'
[13:35:33] <mlu> terminalpusher: just be careful about the implications
[13:35:38] <terminalpusher> you mean duckduckgo
[13:35:44] <mlu> terminalpusher: nah, don't mind google ;)

[18:07:14] <moo> so if i have device that acts as keyboard and sends keypresses (rfid reader), what'd be best way to read them from my app? that is running in background etc
[18:07:36] <Dagmar> Using an app running in the foreground.
[18:07:42] <moo> no
[18:07:57] <moo> i won't even have user logged in or anything
[18:08:01] <clarity> How about read(2)
[18:08:04] <Dagmar> One that's listening to STDIN since the device is deaigned to work like a keyboard to make things simple.
[18:08:21] <Dagmar> So what if it doesn't have a user "logged in"
[18:08:22] <moo> app is not connected to any terminal
[18:08:35] <Dagmar> If you bind something to one of the consoles, that's where it runs, period.
[18:08:48] <moo> there is no console, there is no stdin
[18:08:54] <Dagmar> If it's not connected to a terminal then good luck figuring out whether or not it actually collected data

[18:10:03] <Dagmar> To put this in other terms, you want a program that can secretly collect keystrokes without a user being aware of it.

[18:11:34] *** Quits: kish` (~aqua@user/aqua) (Quit: Leaving)
[18:11:49] <Dagmar> Yes.  The better way is to use it like it was designed to be used.  Read from it like it's a keyboard, and use something that has a screen.
[18:12:03] <Dagmar> Honestly this business of claiming "there's no terminal" is patent nonsense
[18:12:16] <Dagmar> You do not need a user to login to a terminal to put something on a screen or console.
[18:12:20] <TJ-> moo: if you read /dev/input/event you've got to do your own keycode translation
[18:12:24] <moo> its a background app running as daemon that has to read rfid tokens and thats it

[18:14:10] <Dagmar> My "problem" is that I've actually got stuff in the field that does that very thing with a couple of different media types and it didn't take 20 minutes to set it up because I wasn't stuck on the idea of "there's no screen so I have to do things the hardest way possible by reading interrupts"

[18:15:35] <moo> i intend to run it in my garage to open doors when i scan card >.<
[18:15:57] <Dagmar> So get over the idea that you don't have an available console so that you can use it like a keyboard
[18:16:18] <Dagmar> You don't even really need a monitor.  Just stick the reading application directly on vt1 and be done with it
