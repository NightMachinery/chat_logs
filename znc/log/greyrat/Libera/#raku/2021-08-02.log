[17:53:56] <Altreus> > If no more tester Callables are available, the switch will remain in its current state until the end of iteration.  -- is toggle therefore smart enough to terminate an infinite list when it runs out of testers in an off state?
[17:56:19] <lizmat> toggle runs on an iterator: if the iterator produces IterationEnd, it's done
[17:56:41] <lizmat> if it doesn't, it will run forever indeed?

[17:59:11] <elcaro> I replied to the Reddit post. I've always had a soft spot of toggle because of how it generalised the (drop|take)(until|while) functions into one
[18:00:12] <elcaro> but unfortunately not well known, because it's not a common name for this feature (though it's a fine name)
[18:00:41] <elcaro> maybe there is some way docs could point to it when someone searches `takewhile`... that might help a little

[21:30:24] <LarryNB> I must have Kleopatra misconfigured somehow.  I'll just have to remember to use gpg.
[21:31:36] <LarryNB> Sorry for bother, and thanks for the help.
[21:31:44] <MasterDuke> no, i think you just need to add that key
[21:33:50] <LarryNB> OK, I'll need to study how gpg and kleo work more closely. I'd assumed it would add any key it found on any keyserver.
[21:34:49] <LarryNB> It seems like an obvious thing the app should do.
[21:35:10] <Altreus> like gpg does? :D
[21:35:17] <Altreus> where "any keyserver" is "next to the file"
[21:35:20] <MasterDuke> LarryNB: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/raku?date=2021-07-24#l137 for reference
[21:39:03] <LarryNB> OK, thanks MasterDuke, for the reference.  I'll add the key.  Thanks again for the help.
[21:39:34] <LarryNB> Bye now.
