[03:58:21] <herman_b> using ffmpeg 4.4 on macOS i'm trying to output an mp4 from a batch of png files like so:
[03:58:45] <herman_b> ffmpeg -y -framerate 30 -i '%03d.png' -c:v libx264 -crf 0 -preset veryslow output/test.mp4
[03:59:33] <herman_b> to generate as close to a lossless video as i can...the only issue is that macOS (quicktime, preview/finder, etc.) can't play the output
[03:59:43] <furq> most stuff can't play lossless h264
[04:00:13] <furq> also that would be completely lossless with -c:v libx264rgb -qp 0
[04:00:25] <herman_b> i use -pix_fmt yuv420p and remove -crf 0 and that seems to work, but the quality of the video is noticeably "degraded"
[04:00:38] <furq> yeah that's just a regular lossy video
[04:01:59] <herman_b> how would i get an mp4 with the best quality and playable on macOS stuff (and most other platforms/players as well)
[04:02:31] <furq> use a crf somewhere between 0 and 23
[04:02:37] <furq> 23 is the default unless you specify
[04:03:17] <furq> you might also want -level 42 if these pngs are bigger than 720p
[04:05:59] <herman_b> hmmm, i tried -crf 16/17/23/30/40 and none of them are playable with macOS preview or quicktime
[04:06:54] <BtbN> that's unrelated to crf then.
[04:08:37] <furq> you'll need -pix_fmt yuv420p as well
[04:08:53] *** Quits: minimal (~minimal@user/minimal) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:09:42] <herman_b> ah i see, i have to keep the -pix_fmt yuv420p option

[04:22:45] <herman_b> can i also in the same command add an mp3 file? i've been running another command after the first one to add audio separately
[04:25:02] <herman_b> oh nevermind i can add "-i audio.mp3" to the command

[05:06:38] <herman_b> is there a better image format than png for creating an h.264 mp4 using libx264 -crf 1 -pix_fmt yuv420p ? rgb24->yuv420 here and there shows some definite degradation...is that unavoidable?

[15:41:07] <powerman2206> Although I have another question
[15:41:33] <powerman2206> If `-map_metadata -1` removes *all* metadata, `-map_metadata:s:a -1` should only remove the audio metadata, right?
[15:43:04] <powerman2206> 'Cause it don't
[15:45:46] <furq> it works the same way as -map
[15:45:57] <furq> once you use it at all then it overrides all the default behaviour
[15:47:36] <furq> i don't think there's an equivalent of e.g. -map -0:a to map all but one thing
[15:48:35] <powerman2206> Wait, so-

[15:49:58] *** Joins: djk (~Thunderbi@74.102.240.250)
[15:50:29] <powerman2206> And please correct me if I'm wrong
[15:52:06] <powerman2206> `-map_metadata:s:a -1` on its own (without `-map_metadata -1`) *should*, if it works the same as `-map`, remove only the audio metadata. But what I noticed is that it removes audio, subtitle, and (apparently) attachment metadata, probably why ffmpeg gave that error from before
[15:53:01] <furq> right
[15:53:08] <furq> the default is to do the equivalent of -map_metadata 0
[15:53:27] <furq> but as soon as you use -map_metadata at all then it prevents the default behaviour from happening
[15:53:44] <powerman2206> Ah, I see
[15:53:47] <furq> maybe -map_metadata 0 -map _metadata:s:a -1 will work
[15:53:58] <powerman2206> Was just thinking of that, lemme try
[15:54:09] <furq> i've never really used that option in this much detail

[19:22:25] <hiya> Does it come with ffmpeg?
[19:22:26] <BtbN> iirc Firefox comes with its own ultra stripped down version of ffmpeg, including only code that has been vetted by their patent lawyers

[21:33:37] <JEEB> powerman2206: yes PGS are paletted images, so in theory if you're within a palette you can do everything more or less :D
[21:33:52] <JEEB> I think there might be some size limits etc but generally you don't overlay the whole screen anyways

[21:36:44] <powerman2206> I'm pretty sure I saw some torre- I saw a video that had a video stream which was just black and the *actual* video was the subtitles
[21:37:19] <powerman2206> I don't know how, but the video was watchable in full quality through the subtitles. The video was there just to set the resolution

[21:41:24] <powerman2206> I'm reading up on it now. Apparently they took the original video, sliced it up into 16000 PNGs, and then used ASS subtitles' vectors to represent cubes the size of a pixel
[21:41:27] <powerman2206> Or something like that
[21:41:30] <JEEB> yes

[21:41:51] <JEEB> of course technically I think it's less optimized than just doing bitmap stuff
[21:41:53] <furq> that sounds like the kind of bullshit that people are into nowadays
[21:41:56] <gneeriiloeepdeer> image subs... old technology is resilient I guess
[21:42:00] <powerman2206> The resulting file is 1TB for the .ass file
[21:42:06] <powerman2206> For a 23 minute video

[21:42:33] <furq> like i said
[21:42:34] <JEEB> it was a meme show so not surprising
[21:42:45] <gneeriiloeepdeer> do you give audio advice here? do I need dts-hd master audio, or is acc good enough?

[21:42:47] <JEEB> they f.ex. just looped the first episode when they aired
[21:43:01] <furq> define "need"
[21:43:06] <JEEB> I think there might have been some miscule differences between part a and b
[21:43:10] <gneeriiloeepdeer> want
[21:43:11] <JEEB> but it was definitely a troll
[21:43:19] <furq> you probably won't hear any difference
[21:43:20] <gneeriiloeepdeer> do I want it
[21:43:27] <JEEB> pop team epic it was I think
[21:43:27] <zeromind> looping? sounds like teletubbies
[21:43:52] <powerman2206> JEEB: uh, all episodes are looped. First 10 minutes is one VA cast, second 10 minutes is another
[21:43:53] <furq> but it's generally not worth touching audio unless you're desperate for space or you have specific hardware requirements
[21:44:00] <powerman2206> With some small changes to the video
[21:44:04] <JEEB> powerman2206: ah so it was all eps
[21:44:37] <powerman2206> IIRC I just skipped the second part when I watched it, but I might watch it all if I get really bored
[21:44:44] <powerman2206> But this isn't ffmpeg related so I'll shut
[21:44:46] <zeromind> they announced a new one for this year it seems

[21:46:11] <gneeriiloeepdeer> is pgs also a picture format for subtitles?
[21:46:18] <furq> yes
[21:46:18] <powerman2206> Yes
[21:46:22] <furq> pgs is bluray subs
[21:46:26] <gneeriiloeepdeer> jeez
[21:46:29] <furq> there's also dvb subtitles

[21:46:48] <gneeriiloeepdeer> what's wrong with srt? its small and plain text,what else could you need?
[21:46:56] <powerman2206> I mean ASS is better in terms of quality, but I'll take PGS over SRT

[21:47:32] <furq> do you want to tell the guys making a $20 bluray player it has to be able to render arabic text correctly to be spec compliant
[21:47:47] <furq> or do you want to just leave that up to the production house
[21:47:51] <powerman2206> I meant overall, not on Blu-Rays
[21:47:56] <powerman2206> Fansubs and stuff
[21:47:59] <furq> it basically doesn't exist outside of hardware
