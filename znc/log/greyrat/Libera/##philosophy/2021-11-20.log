[12:20:42] <pussipupu> amigojapan: lemon tarts are wonderful things
[12:21:40] <amigojapan> pussipupu: very rare in Japan. But available in some selected places
[12:22:01] <pussipupu> Not very hard to make though, if you felt like it :)
[12:22:29] <pussipupu> arryana: We're thinking of focusing on scent training, mostly for fungi and humans
[12:22:30] <amigojapan> pussipupu: Japanese houses don't usually have an oven tho
[12:22:38] <pussipupu> The two main food groups
[12:22:47] <pussipupu> amigojapan: Gosh, I'd really struggle with that
[12:23:17] <amigojapan> pussipupu: many people say that. You can get an electric one
[12:23:35] <pussipupu> Our oven is already electric :Ã¾
[12:23:41] <arryana> border collies are lovely, but high energy
[12:23:46] <pussipupu> Well, technically our ovens, but only the old one is wired in
[12:24:08] <pussipupu> They are but we have much forest to train/play in :)
[12:24:29] <amigojapan> I see
[12:24:37] <arryana> my first wolf's best friend was a border collie, i have real affection for them
[12:25:01] <arryana> somwhere i have a photo of them playing on crissy field with the golden gate bridge behind them

[13:44:51] <amigojapan> pussipupu: sorry for the delayed reply. I have a gas stove. A microwave and an electric toaster oven, and a rice cooker
[13:45:31] <pussipupu> No worries, and i miss gas hobs
[13:47:13] <amigojapan> pussipupu: my water heating system also works on has. But it has no boiler
[13:47:32] <amigojapan> It's one of the ones that warms as it goes
[13:47:49] <amigojapan> Gas
[13:49:50] <pussipupu> Our water is now based on a heat pump, we had oil-fired water heating until last year though
[13:50:00] <pussipupu> Now we just have a useless oil tank :Ã¾
[13:53:56] <amigojapan> pussipupu: I see. I have a heat pump for cooling and heating
[13:54:05] <amigojapan> But not water
[13:54:59] <pussipupu> Ours only does water heating, we don't have any active cooling systems
[13:55:11] <amigojapan> Ah
[13:56:24] <pussipupu> It's a drop-in replacement for the old oil-burning boiler, so we didn't have to do as much work as we would have needed for aircon
[13:56:42] <arryana> does it get hot enough there that you need it?
[13:57:47] <arryana> i don't think it topped 26c here, and that might have been two or three days all year.

[13:58:02] <pussipupu> It gets hot enough that it'd be nice, but I find anything above 20 pretty painful
[13:58:09] * arryana nods
[13:58:13] <pussipupu> We were around 30 for a couple of weeks I think
[13:58:40] <pussipupu> I'm also very conscious that aircon hates Gaia, and I'm generally in favour of survivable biospheres
[13:58:44] <arryana> we do ditch the west side rooms in the summer, for the most part
[13:58:48] <pussipupu> Cal me old-fashioned if you will :Ã¾
[13:58:50] <arryana> at least for the 'hot' days
[13:59:00] <arryana> nope, we're the same
[13:59:06] * arryana is under an open window right now
[13:59:32] <arryana> granted, it's a mild 11 out
[14:00:11] <arryana> our guests enjoyed it, fortunately
[14:00:32] <arryana> texans both, they're used to their living spaces being 22c or so
[14:00:43] <pussipupu> Luckily Finnish window engineering is better than English, we can open all the windows, even the ones several m^2 in size
[14:00:50] <pussipupu> And hide in the basement :Ã¾
[14:00:57] <arryana> haha
[14:01:24] <arryana> the west rooms get warm, though we have heat-reflective light blocking curtains back there
[14:01:31] <pussipupu> With global warming though, it might be that aircon becomes more needed here over the coming years
[14:01:43] <arryana> yeah, that's part of why i was asking
[14:02:00] <pussipupu> But we'd do solar first, so at least the energy is relatively clean
[14:02:07] <arryana> i think next year we'll install an attic fan, they're very cheap to run, but they pull an astonishing amount of air through a house
[14:02:38] <pussipupu> I need to set up fans to distribute the heat from the fireplace better in winter, tangentially
[14:02:48] * arryana nods
[14:03:04] <arryana> each room here has its own radiator, which i personally love.
[14:03:28] <amigojapan> pussipupu: I recommend a single room mini split. That's what I have
[14:03:34] <arryana> my other half can keep his office warm for guitar/typing, and i can keep the craft room moderate, and the zen room cool.
[14:04:29] <arryana> the temperature tanks tonight, so it's time to pack up the conservatory for the year, sadly.
[14:04:56] <arryana> not that we won't still use it with the electric fire, but it won't be generally open to the house.

[14:05:17] <arryana> if there's a way to insulate them better without it becoming an oven in the summer, i don't know what it is
[14:05:37] <pussipupu> It's not really cold here yet, due for minimums of about -10 next week apparently though
[14:08:16] <arryana> oof
[14:09:32] <arryana> it goes from 50sf daytime high/40s nighttime low to 40s high/30's lows with a few nights at or below freezing, as of tonight
[14:10:29] <arryana> i'm looking forward to the snow

[14:19:40] <pussipupu> I should go swimming, but I suspect the local pond is a bit chilly now
[14:20:36] <amigojapan> pussipupu: we just went sun bathing
[14:20:50] <amigojapan> pussipupu: it was 18c
[14:21:31] <pussipupu> Fair enough, hope you enjoyed it :)
[14:23:50] <amigojapan> We did, but we used up most of our money on the hotel and may need to eat cup ramen at the end of the month
[14:24:22] <amigojapan> We stayed a total of 2 weeks
[14:40:19] <arryana> i have no idea where people swim around here, maybe loch lomond.  i failed to get the hot tub assembled this year.

[22:26:48] <varde> There are limits to what moves you can make with your eyes and thus they have preconfigured motion.
[22:27:38] <causative> you can look at anything in your field of vision
[22:27:49] <varde> Yeah but only from certain angles
[22:28:11] <causative> you can look at anything from any angle
[22:28:32] <causative> have you ever seen how eye tracking technology tracks where a person looks at a computer screen? they can look anywhere
[22:28:34] <varde> Any angle being a set of angles not infinite angles so yes I agree
[22:28:50] <causative> your eyes do move in jumps called saccades but this doesn't mean they are limited to only certain positions
[22:29:27] <causative> you can look at something while turning your head from side to side, and your eyes will stay smoothly focused on it without saccades, traveling through a continuous set of angles
[22:29:43] <varde> Yep
