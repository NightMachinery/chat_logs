[01:50:19] <johs1> i I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
[01:50:21] <johs1> Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
[01:50:23] <johs1> There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in
[01:50:25] <johs1> combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.

[03:35:46] <rascul> yaml
[03:35:47] <TJ-> jacekowski: yes, I thought that from day 1 the choice of commands, and the word-order is very counter-intutive
[03:36:13] <TJ-> jacekowski: almost pyscadelic :)
[03:36:21] <arahael> jacekowski: yaml is definitely worse.  yaml seems nice, but it's ambigious.  xml is verbose, but not ambigious.
[03:37:10] <[[R]]> rascul: because it reminds you of food?
[03:37:23] <rascul> i'm having yaml for dinner
[03:37:55] <TJ-> xml is far too verbose for human usage, and wastes space that machines do not need.
[03:38:01] <rascul> xml's verboseness sucks but i'll take it over yaml if i have to edit by hand

My first question is in regards to the mechanism of bash's subshells. From what I know, it creates a subshell for each `jq` process. Since there is a limit to how many processes can be run by any user, does bash throttle the while loop (noticing performance degredation in my script)? My second question would

[08:01:13] <peterhil_> keir had a good point about systemd being a threatening change. I find it really sad that there is barely a distro nowadays on distrowatch without systemd.

[08:32:51] <Boradt> so is this channel against sms style english and to what extent?
[08:32:52] <Psi-Jack> Set Top Boxes are still popular today./

[08:34:00] <n4dir> Sauvin: aha !
[08:34:07] <keir> Psi-Jack: they never get referred to as STBs. STBs were specifically the boxes used for digital TV
[08:34:11] <arahael> Sauvin: Not to mention, those who rely on translations.
[08:34:20] <peterhil_> Sauvin: Is it a preference to write things open, so as to be accessible to screen reader users?
[08:34:22] <keir> which is now no longer used since the Digital Switchover in 2010
[08:34:26] <kirk781> arahael, I only remembered because I saw it in an episode of "Extreme Railways"
[08:34:32] <arahael> kirk781: Ah, nice. :)
[08:34:34] <Psi-Jack> keir: STB's were ANY set-tops, not just for cable/dtv.
[08:34:35] <hodapp> Sauvin: Yes, I do too, particularly when it comes to things like lecturing people on the dictionary, or talking at them like they're literally mentally retarded when their sentence structure is a little off.
[08:34:51] <n4dir> was it called lolbible? that was funny. or is
[08:35:10] <keir> Psi-Jack: yes but when people said set-top box they meant a dtv box. that was the colloquial use

[11:57:04] <arahael> betterOne: systemd is well known as being an init system, there are a whole bunch of services that you can run - either at boot time, in a particular order, or in response to some sort of trigger.
[11:57:27] <petaflot_> hello.. I was hopig someone could give me a clue ; trying to open a serial port as a regular user fails (screen terminating) but works as root. user is in uucp group and ttyUSB0 was chmod 666 ; what could be wrong?
[11:57:40] <arahael> betterOne: However, not all of these services have to be "system" services, they can be user services as well, as an example, on my system I have setup syncthing as a *user* service, and that's where you'll see --user get used.
[11:58:21] <steev> you can do some fun things with it

The boottleneck is often the capacity of the last mile of the transmission line from the server to the Internet. It is often controlled by the Internet provider and cost. Is there a technical term that descibes this maximum number of clients to be served simultaneously?

Often, the linux admin starts their job at the initial install of hardware or a VM.  Then, either a manual or automated OS install is used.  After that, patching, misc user requests, and custom software configuration are the main things.  Also, if backups and restores are
[17:18:11] <bpmedley>  sometimes in order.  That has gotten me 80-90% as a generalist linux admin.

[18:24:22] <tahc> I've heard great things about org-mode. Is there something like that outside of emacs that's just like org-mode?

[18:26:15] <hodapp> rascul: two big selling points for me are: since I can use it from my browser, I can just SSH tunnel into work's beefy 96-core & 8-GPU server and let my notebooks reside there, but interact from my local workstation and have latency matter very little

[18:26:53] <hodapp> rascul: and: if I work in straight Python I will spend a whole lot of time just keeping track of what code/context produced what results, and when it gets into complicated visualizations or transforms on data, just keeping track of things can be more effort than the work itself
[18:27:17] <hodapp> so the benefit of a notebook interface is that it keeps the whole session of code alongside its results for later reference, even once I've shut down the session
[18:27:40] <tahc> Has anyone used a planner called zim? How does it compare to org-mode?
[18:28:00] <neoncortex> sometimes I think in write an interpreter that would receive a line, and if this line happens to be an org-babel header, it would read to the #end_src statement, and interpret/compile it in the appropriate environinment, writing the results in a file.  So, babel everywhere, even in ed üòÉ

[19:55:31] <tahc> I was thinking of just compiling the modules knotMez, which means I won't have to compile the entire kernel, just the modules.

[20:00:02] <tahc> I'm just saying knotMez, is that I'm willing to give linux another chance with regards to tablet hardware. By following upstream, I can get a newer tablet work faster.
[20:00:31] <powerman2206> He's going through some "making /bin an .img file that gets checksumed by the initramfs which is integrated into the kernel and if the checksums don't match it doesn't get mounted" steps
[20:00:40] <knotMez> tahc yeah I didn't see any upgrade with functionality fooling around with my tablet just now
[20:00:54] <powerman2206> Meanwhile I've had this idea since he mentioned making the challenge
[20:01:08] <knotMez> tahc it works but if the eraser is doing anything special I can't tell
[20:01:09] <yanmaani> powerman2206: he might want to mount everytihng but /bin and friends as noexec, but that's draconian
[20:01:15] <yanmaani> will prevent anyone from installing any software
[20:01:28] <tahc> Well the documentation recommends not using the distro releases if you got an obscure or too new tablet, there's a kernel driver, an xorg program, and a library that all 3 are required.
[20:01:29] <powerman2206> Well, it's not supposed to be usable :P
[20:01:32] <paulcarroty> powerman2206 it's easy as 2+2

[22:15:56] <Mion> with C you will end up spending a month trying to write a safe linked list, while in other languages you would realise that you should simply use an array instead and have completed your first game in that same time

[22:16:13] <PaulFertser> hodapp: hm, I think Python is duck-typing style, and it checks all the types very late, in runtime, so that's really far from being a good easy example of a strongly typed language it seems.
