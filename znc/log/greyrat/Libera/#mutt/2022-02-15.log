[00:45:53] <dfdx> alternatively, if anyone here uses fastmail, would also love to pick your brain a bit on how you are able to send mail (I can receive, but strangely not send).
[00:49:19] <Betawolf> fastmail works fine for me with just `set smtp_url=smtps://user:pass@smtp.fastmail.com`. Have you set up the app password thing for smtp?
[00:50:19] <dfdx> Betawolf: yeah, let me try doing that again. thanks.
[00:50:26] <Betawolf> (user is user@fastmail.com, if that's a stumbling point)
[00:51:04] <dfdx> when I do that I get a "SASL Authentication Failed" error.
[00:51:19] <dfdx> oohhh
[00:51:47] *** Joins: fling (~fling@user/fling)
[00:52:41] <dfdx> now I get a different error: SMTP session failed: 504 5.5.2 <MYNAME>: Sender address rejected: need fully-qualified address
[00:52:54] <dfdx> for reference I have imap set up perfectly in gmail.
[00:53:12] <dfdx> but when I try to compile an email in mutt, the "from:" line item doesn't show my email address at all, just my name.
[00:53:22] <dfdx> (my name, not even my username)
[00:53:51] <Betawolf> you can change that with 'set from=' but it's probably not the issue
[00:54:07] <Betawolf> Oh, unless it's checking your fromname isn't spoofing?
[00:55:15] <dfdx> when i remove the "set from=" line, when I compose an email, I get my hostname lol., i.e., dfdx@MYCOMPUTERNAME.myfiosgateway.com
[00:55:33] <Betawolf> you could try setting from to your fastmail address, user@fastmail.com
[00:57:15] <dfdx> omg. that worked.
[00:57:41] <dfdx> thank you!!!
[00:57:45] <Betawolf> cool
[00:57:56] <dfdx> so bizarre. I was looking in the wrong place, didn't expect "set from" to be the issue either.
[00:59:10] <Betawolf> the thing that should be your real name is, appropriately, `set realname=`
[00:59:38] <Betawolf> (or, like whatever you want your name to be, it's a display setting, not a cop)
[00:59:57] <dfdx> aha. excellent.

[01:01:02] <dfdx> This is probably off-topic, but I am de-GMailing myself and was split between ProtonMail and FastMail. I'm using OpenBSD, and unfortunately ProtonMail is... very difficult to set up with mutt. Even with this issue above, I was able to get FastMail receiving and sending emails in 15 minutes.
[01:02:31] <Betawolf> it is a good service, I very rarely have to think about it at all
[01:05:23] <dfdx> I need to read a bit more about their privacy/encryption.
[01:11:38] <Betawolf> ProtonMail is better on that count, FastMail don't have end-to-end or any service-side guarantees beyond not selling your data.

[01:14:55] <dfdx> ah, yeah. I wish I could get ProtonMail working, but ProtonMail Bridge is only for Windows, Mac, and Linux -- not OpenBSD. And I couldn't get mutt working properly with hydroxide (https://github.com/emersion/hydroxide).

[01:26:22] <dfdx> So I have ProtonMail and FastMail both working with mutt on OpenBSD now. Woo! Time to flip a coin.

[20:50:48] <patanga> rwp: thanks for answering my question where a configuration could have been, so that sent emails are recorded in a location used previously.
[20:52:20] <patanga> rwp: then i saw that there is a ~/.vim/ but not a ~/.mutt/ so i did "locate mutt" and found /etc/firejail/mupdf.profile in which there is the value of "record". Seems that Debian messes Mutt up...

[21:28:39] <rwp> patanga, Never heard of firejail before.  I use Debian mutt with no problems.  For files in your personal $HOME you get to create those files if you want them not Debian.
[21:29:08] <rwp> I don't see any connection between /etc/firejail/mupdf.profile and mutt.  Seems like that is a different thing entirely.
[21:30:22] <rwp> patanga, If you want to make personal customizations create a ~/.muttrc file and place your configuration entries there.
[21:31:01] <rwp> Then exit every running mutt program so that all are exited.  Then start a new mutt and it will read the current configuration and run.
[21:34:08] <rwp> Reading about firejail I see it is designed to be a mandatory access control for file access and if you are using it with mutt then it can be blocking mutt's ability to write to the record file.
[21:34:33] <rwp> I suggest running mutt without firejail.

[22:56:55] <patanga> rwp: oh, mupdf was autocomplete. it is /etc/firejail/mutt.profile . antixlinux is a debian incarnation which includes firejail. 
[22:58:05] <patanga> rwp: as far as i know (have not checked the processes in the meantime) mutt was not running when i changed the "record" variable in ~/.muttrc
[22:58:49] <patanga> rwp: also i have never heard about firejail until i found it had mutt configuration variables stored in it.
[23:00:52] <patanga> rwp: for the rest antixlinux can be recommended. it runs in ram and is somehow similar to mxlinux which supposedly is the most widely used linux distro at the moment
[23:16:50] <patanga> rwp: antixlinux comes from greece and is therefore very classic.

[23:33:44] <patanga> mutt.org states that mutt sucks less. this has spawned several things, among which the suckless project with regular conferences in very important cities like Budapest. In fact there is a whole sphere pertaining to mutt, also irc channels: #mutt #suckless #neomutt and who knows what else. suckless has issued a bunch of useless programs, btw
[23:35:20] <patanga> it all started as a counter movement against MH (mail handler) by  the Rand thinktank, which did the Vietnam war and so on. Only that Mutt was some decades too late.
[23:35:35] <patanga> that really sucks
[23:36:01] <patanga> mh is still in active development and use ...
[23:36:31] <patanga> mh *of* the Rand *corporation*
[23:37:20] <patanga> mutt came into being 18 years after mh
[23:39:01] <patanga> strange why one cannot print the number of calendar weeks with "cal" but with "ncal". similarly mh comes as nmh, e-mh or who knows what. mutt has only one reincarnation. Soothing.
[23:40:33] <patanga> and then there is Gunnar Ritter, the anonymous knight who created the heirloom tools including one incarnation called mailx...
