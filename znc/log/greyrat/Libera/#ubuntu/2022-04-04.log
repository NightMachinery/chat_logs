[03:11:17] <RonRN18> I'm hoping someone can help me understand what is wrong with my setup. I have a new computer with an NVMe SSD as my primary drive and I wish to build Ubuntu on it with the ZFS filesystem. I am able to set it up but upon first boot, it always ends with a failed boot in "Emergency mode" or something to that effect and I can go no further.

[03:14:42] <RonRN18> As an alternative, I tried following the instructions from OpenZFS about installing Debian 11 Bullseye root on ZFS and also failing on boot. On the Debian side, it ends up pausing with "(intramfs)" on the screen. I'm not sure how to get beyond that. I really want ZFS as the filesystem to make incremental snapshots as needed.

[03:16:57] <Croran> RonRN18: as for why your configuration doesn't work, this page says, "currently only MAAS allows ZFS to be installed as a root filesystem.

[03:26:28] <RonRN18> Prior to trying to build this machine on a "bare-metal" machine, I made a test-run using a VM on XCP-ng. In my VM, I gave the VM five "hard drives". I installed Ubuntu 22.04 using ZFS and making the first drive a single vdev. It installed flawlessly. I then made the other drives function as a raidz pool. All went exactly as I expected it to. With this success on a VM, I figured it would be
[03:26:28] <RonRN18> easy to do on a bare-metal machine and it has been nothing but failures.

[10:19:21] <croran_44[m]> oh here's a good tip for command line: Instead of using the 'cp source destinationfolder' syntax to copy files into a folder, switch to the 'cp -t destinationfolder source' syntax. It will warn you if the destination doesn't exist instead of copying your files into a newly-named file.
[10:21:10] <alkisg> cp source destinationfolder/ (with an ending /)

[10:44:13] <tomreyn> hackinghorn: depending on the question you're asking, the most crucial info can be ubuntu release (lsb_release -ds) - this is almost always needed, architecture (arch), kernel version (cat /proc/version), graphical desktop (echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE/$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP), and details on drivers / hardware if you're asking questions related to that.

[20:57:59] <Kolusion> thelounge5546: If you play around you can deff get it working, but I didn't have the time to play around. OpenVPN's documentation is appalling.
[20:58:19] <thelounge5546> once you get in touch with it, its piece of cake
[20:58:39] <Kolusion> Sure man

[20:59:15] <thelounge5546> well, you can always try TINC
[20:59:36] <Kolusion> Thanks man. My time with VPN servers is done. PPTP will securely serve my needs. :)
[21:00:01] <thelounge5546> yes i understand
[21:00:13] <thelounge5546> Dial-UP! FTW :)
[21:00:19] <Kolusion> The authentication is still secure, despite the encryption being broken, but as all my traffic through it will be encrypted anyway, I am just turning encryption off.

[22:35:04] <leftyfb> en7ropy: I could maybe help with removing the repo and maybe help reinstalling the proper python, but other than just deleting things in /usr/local/bin/, I'm not so sure it's enough. This is a big mess. I can you tell, it will be a LOT quicker, cleaner and easier to just reinstall

[22:39:41] <leftyfb> en7ropy: that would be my suggestion, yes
[22:39:57] <llutz> en7ropy: think about that next time before you ruin your installation again :)
[22:40:05] <leftyfb> en7ropy: a reinstall is quick. As is reinstalling the packages you want. Then just restore the backup of your personal files

[22:40:42] <alkisg> en7ropy: you can keep your /home while reinstalling, it's not hard
[22:40:59] <alkisg> I.e. no copying your data back and forth involved, as long as you select the "custom" option in the partitioning step
[22:41:40] <alkisg> As for solving the initial issue, I would start with moving /usr/local to /usr/local.bad, then take it from there

[22:45:50] <en7ropy> leftyfb: Ok, I understand.  Thank you for the help you've already provided me
[22:45:52] <alkisg> If yes, I could take a quick look over vnc, to solve things more quickly
[22:45:55] <leftyfb> alkisg: tmate
[22:46:21] <alkisg> Sure, or just my own reverse epoptes-client, it's in the repos :)
[22:46:22] <leftyfb> alkisg: tmate will give you ssh that they can watch without poking holes in firewalls
[22:46:33] <alkisg> Yes, x11vnc as well
[22:46:49] <alkisg> And without a foreign server between us
[22:47:11] <alkisg> x11vnc and epoptes-client use reverse connections; they bypass nats and firewalls
[22:47:16] <en7ropy> alkisg: I'm new to this, what is vnc and tmate?
[22:47:45] <alkisg> en7ropy: try that command, it's a small program; if the installation doesn't work, no point in pursuing that path more: sudo apt install x11vnc
[22:48:01] <alkisg> If your dpkg is so broken that it can't do that, then you'd need to reinstall
[22:48:17] <alkisg> IF it works, then an x11vnc -connect command will share your screen with me
[22:48:35] <en7ropy> alkisg: Yup, got an error.... dpkg seems broken.....
[22:49:04] <alkisg> Does it work if you run: sudo mv /usr/local /usr/local.bad
[22:49:14] <alkisg> And then apt install...
[22:49:47] <alkisg> Or, if you happen to have a live cd, the same tasks could be accomplished from the live cd
[22:50:25] <en7ropy> alkisg: I'm super concerned about moving the /usr/local ... that's kosher??
[22:50:39] <alkisg> Normally /usr/local is pretty much empty
[22:50:49] <alkisg> That stuff you put there might be what breaks apt and the other things
[22:50:58] <alkisg> You can still move it back if you see something ...non-kosher
[22:50:59] <en7ropy> alkisg: I don't have a livecd, no cd drive, I could try to install Ubuntu on a USB stick though
[22:51:10] <en7ropy> Ok, will try
[22:51:23] <alkisg> Sure a live USB would also work fine
