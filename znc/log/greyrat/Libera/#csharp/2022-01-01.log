[00:04:12] <sysRPN> i bought one of those 8mm film digitizer boxes for christmas and have been digitizing my old family films for days
[00:05:11] <sysRPN> one of the reels we have is about 5 minutes of jimmy carter at various places around kennedy space center in 1975
[00:05:46] <sysRPN> and it's pretty up close footage
[00:06:41] <sysRPN> i also found some of our original footage of the space shuttle explosion from 1986
[00:07:08] *** sysRPN is now known as sysRPL
[00:13:38] <sysRPL> https://cache.codebot.org/videos/home/jimmy-carter.mp4
[00:20:16] <sysRPL> https://cache.codebot.org/videos/home/challenger-explosion.mp4
[00:26:04] <bpmedley> The quality looks pretty good for such aged footage.

[05:37:57] <lz_> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3n3c_8Nn2Y
[05:38:08] <Tobbi> By the way: From the way you write, I conclude you're from some country like Afghanistan.
[05:38:10] <bomb> lz couldn't buy one haha what a loser
[05:38:16] <Tobbi> But it might as well be my association.
[05:38:34] <Tobbi> I'm sorry if I offended you.
[05:38:36] <Tobbi> I didn't mean it.
[05:38:43] <Tobbi> I am simply writing what I'm writing.
[05:38:54] <Tobbi> You see, I don't like getting drunk.
[05:39:01] <Tobbi> But I was invited by guys who like getting drunk.
[05:39:05] <Tobbi> So what other choice did that leave me.
[05:39:14] <Tobbi> right?
[05:39:17] <lz_> bomb: with my 2 gpus i have like 15tflops
[05:39:19] <Tobbi> I mean, what would you have done.
[05:39:28] <lz_> I just wanted to rent a v100 to get things done faster
[05:39:43] <lz_> also getting an ati to run on linux is a fucking nightmare
[05:40:12] *** Parts: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb) (‎)
[05:40:15] <Tobbi> Damn.
[05:40:17] <Tobbi> I offended him.
[05:40:20] <Tobbi> I didn't mean to.

[05:40:28] <Tobbi> I'm moderately sad.
[05:41:29] <lz_> < Tobbi> So what other choice did that leave me.
[05:41:34] <lz_> just say "no thank you", that works fine
[05:41:41] <Tobbi> lz_: You're right. I should'v.
[05:41:47] <Tobbi> But that would've meant spending time alone...
[05:41:50] <Tobbi> On New Year's Eve.
[05:42:05] <Tobbi> I'm lonely enough as it is.
[05:42:11] <Tobbi> Any company is better than no company.
[05:42:14] <lz_> I mean no thank you for the alcohol, but you can still go to the party
[05:42:16] <Tobbi> Even if it's bad company.
[05:42:22] <Tobbi> Oh, yeah, that would've helped.
[05:42:26] <Tobbi> but then again, there's peer pressure.
[05:42:31] <Tobbi> Or should I call that "beer pressure"?
[05:42:46] <lz_> it's important to be able to say no even with peer pressure
[05:43:13] <Tobbi> Yes.
[05:43:14] <Tobbi> I agree.
[05:43:21] <Tobbi> Oh well, in hindsight.
[05:43:34] <Tobbi> Next time I won't get drunk.
[05:43:36] <Tobbi> I promise.
[05:43:56] <lz_> there will always be "that guy" who will make annoying jokes about you not drinking alcohol
[05:44:00] <lz_> fuck that guy
[05:44:21] <Tobbi> I know...
[05:44:26] <Tobbi> It's kind of a ... IDK...
[05:44:33] <Tobbi> I wouldn't even call it peer pressure.
[05:44:45] <Tobbi> I just don't want to be alone...and to some extent, alcohol makes the whole evening more fun.
[05:47:48] <lz_> well fuck, my radeon gpu is no longer supported
[05:47:56] <lz_> i keep wasting my time it's crazy
[05:48:21] <Tobbi> radeon...you keep wasting your...eeh...what's it called? The thing with the atoms and the decay?
[05:48:22] <Tobbi> Halflife?
[05:48:26] <lz_> 4 tflops down the toilets
[05:48:26] <Tobbi> Is that what it is?
[05:48:51] <Tobbi> radeon is not something I'd want...it's radioactive
[05:49:00] <MatthiasVance> Want to buy my 1080 for 1600 EUR?
[05:49:12] <lz_> MatthiasVance: I have a 1080, it's just busy doing other things
[05:49:21] <Tobbi> MatthiasVance, my friend. I greet you.
[05:49:32] <MatthiasVance> lz_: Ah
[05:49:43] <MatthiasVance> lz_: Sounds like you need an additional 1080
[05:50:11] <Tobbi> I'm gonna stop.
[05:50:21] <Tobbi> I feel like I'm getting on your collective nerves.

[18:54:02] <guideX> my own domain name perhaps?
[18:54:18] <BtbN> No idea, but most bigger smtp servers have disabled plain username+passwort auth

[18:54:24] <guideX> I'm not sure if it's proper
[18:54:26] <BtbN> you need to go through the respective vendors oauth flow

[18:55:28] <BtbN> You can still slap oauth in front of standard smtp. i.e. what Google does
[18:55:46] <JakeSays> i know, but it's not required. nor is it for google.
[18:56:02] <BtbN> It's pretty much required for Google.
[18:56:16] <BtbN> The old auth flow causes constant "Your account is not secure, fix it now!!!" panic warnings

[19:34:45] <Tobbi> last year...
[19:34:46] <Tobbi> yeah
[19:35:46] <Tobbi> People also didn't appreciate me calling radeon radioactive.
[19:39:10] <MatthiasVance> Dude Tobbi get over it
[19:39:28] <Tobbi> MatthiasVance: Okay. I will.
[19:39:33] <MatthiasVance> You were the only person saying you were annoying
[19:39:43] <Tobbi> Alright.
[19:40:01] <Tobbi> Sorry, I tend to...beat myself up over things.
[19:40:31] <MatthiasVance> If you are worried you are viewed differently, you aren't. 😄
[19:40:37] <MatthiasVance> *now
[19:40:43] <Tobbi> :D
[19:40:48] <Tobbi> You mean I've already reached rock bottom :D

[19:41:04] <Tobbi> :D
[19:41:10] <Slade> hmm, the gym in the hotel is full
[19:42:51] <MatthiasVance> Guten Rutsch Tobbi 🥂
[19:43:02] <Tobbi> Ebenso, MatthiasVance
[19:43:04] <Tobbi> Frohes Neues! :)
[19:43:30] <MatthiasVance> Slade: Invite someone up for a workout
[19:45:11] <Slade> hmm. no one in this crowd

[20:19:48] <ern> No gym :(
[20:19:57] <Nasp> Gym requires vaccination passport i think
[20:20:06] <Nasp> But may go down to requiring daily tests to go outside
[20:20:16] <Nasp> Alsl it's 1st of january ofc the gym is full
[20:20:47] <ern> Yeah, they require QR since 15 of Nov :/
[20:20:54] <ern> And from tomorrow, all stores will require QR
[20:20:57] <Nasp> Really?
[20:21:01] <Nasp> I've never seen anyone scan it
[20:21:36] <ern> I do have a QR code, but if gym is so dangerous you must have a QR to enter, I rather just waste the money I spent on the membership than go there.
[20:21:58] <Nasp> Worst part is they need staff to be there to checke verybody
[20:23:25] <ern> We'll see how long this crazyness will go on.
[20:23:34] <MatthiasVance> Until we vaccinate everybody :)
[20:23:36] <ern> I can order most tings on mail order, delivered to bottom floor of my house.
[20:23:44] <MatthiasVance> Or let the virus eradicate as many as possible
[20:23:51] <JakeSays> Slade: where are you?
[20:24:01] <Nasp> Well until everybody is vaccinated 5-10 times?
[20:24:08] <MatthiasVance> No, *everybody*
[20:24:09] <Slade> JakeSays, texas
[20:24:23] <Nasp> Next up is 4th shot right

[20:24:45] <Nasp> You'll never get everybody vaccinated
[20:25:03] <ern> Even so, a venue that require my QR code will not get my moneys.
[20:25:19] <Nasp> Aren't they required by law to do so?
[20:25:25] <ern> They are.
[20:25:34] <JakeSays> ern: if you aren't vaccinated then i doubt they want your money
[20:25:43] <Nasp> ern:  Then what's the issue?
[20:25:48] <MatthiasVance> They want his money but not him
[20:25:48] <MatthiasVance> :D
[20:25:56] <JakeSays> i know i wouldn't
[20:25:57] <ern> Nasp: So you mean I should go and show my QR code to do things?
[20:26:06] <MatthiasVance> ern: Yes
[20:26:06] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: lol
[20:26:08] <Nasp> Well either that or stay at home
[20:26:52] <ern> Well, the governmen thas decided its dangerous to go to places so I think I rather not.
[20:27:11] <Nasp> It's dangerous except when you are a lot of people then it's okay
[20:27:19] <MatthiasVance> ern: Yes
[20:27:25] <ern> I fail to see how QR code can protect from anything
[20:27:43] <MatthiasVance> It doesn't
[20:27:51] <JakeSays> Nasp: he can be more than one people?
[20:27:52] <MatthiasVance> well
[20:28:13] <JakeSays> and since when did ubuntu start requiring root to run dmesg, dammit
[20:28:21] <Nasp> I still have a feeling i could have handled this corona lockdown a lot better than the gov
[20:28:41] <ern> JakeSays: really?
[20:28:56] <MatthiasVance> ern: It's all about numbers / acceptable risk. So you can lower risk by only having vaccinated / tested people in a place.
[20:29:29] <ern> JakeSays: Hmm, 18.03 LTS I can do dmesg, but then I am in the sudoers group
[20:29:40] <JakeSays> fuck. it's back to filling the logs with audit noise
[20:29:45] <Nasp> I still find it BS the corona vaccination now expires after 9 months
[20:29:46] <JakeSays> ern: i just upgraded to 21.4

[20:29:51] <irwiss> Nasp: it's dangerous unless you're losing lots of money, then infection risk magically lowers proportionate to loss amount
[20:29:54] <Nasp> We were promised get the vaccinate and be happy
[20:30:01] <Nasp> And then they lower the duratiions
[20:30:20] <ern> Nasp: No, the corona vaccination card (in EU) expires after 9 months.
[20:30:20] <Nasp> irwiss:  Like VM in football got exempt during corona
[20:30:24] <Nasp> While everything else was closed
[20:30:53] <irwiss> yup, tons of money involved in football, both white and black markets
[20:30:55] <ern> Nasp: You can always apply for a new QR and depending on what government feel for the day, you may and may not get an extension for 9 months, but the actual QR is valid 9 months
[20:30:56] <Nasp> Ohh right bitch prime minister new years speech
[20:31:10] <Nasp> ern:  No our QR codes are valid for barely a day
[20:31:20] <Nasp> Sometimes even hours
[20:31:32] <Nasp> Which is a bit of an issue when the backend services constantly goes down
[20:31:32] <ern> Nasp: In Russia, the QR is validated online, not as EU with signed QR. Basicaly, the QR takes you to a web page on the government portal where it's shown if valid or not.
[20:31:49] <ern> They had an issue with the backend where my QR was "invalid" and after that I pledged not to used it.
[20:31:54] <JakeSays> Nasp: that's just short of useless
[20:32:00] <Nasp> JakeSays:  It is
[20:32:05] <Nasp> So when it's down people can't go anywhere
[20:32:07] <Nasp> Not even take the trains :D
[20:32:15] <JakeSays> i meant the time frame
[20:32:18] <ern> Nasp: Where are you?
[20:32:18] <Nasp> Ahh
[20:32:21] <Nasp> I am in Denmark
[20:32:34] <ern> But is that system not based on the EU system with a signed QR
[20:32:43] <ern> which is offline
[20:32:55] <ern> the key had leaked so people made QRs for Adolf H and all sort of people.
[20:33:05] <JakeSays> ern: LOL
[20:33:21] <ern> And that's the reason the QR is valid 9 months (by FEDERAL LAW)
[20:33:24] <Nasp> ern:  Yeah but it's still not offline cached
[20:33:30] <Nasp> And not sure if it changes hourly or something
[20:33:42] <ern> Can't you print it in Denmark?
[20:33:51] <ern> or screenshot your screen?
[20:34:04] <ern> then it should be (according to spec) valid for 9 months regardless
[20:34:35] <ern> in Sweden, I know for a fact you order it on paper, printed, or can get it to "electronic mailbox" as PDF
[20:34:46] <ern> and then use that to show, as "offline" as it gets. Albeit 9 month valid.
[20:35:06] <Nasp> Hmm dunno i can try, but i dont think any places will accept it
[20:36:25] <Nasp> Also i dont own a printer :D
[20:36:30] <Nasp> It would just make more sense if the app offline cached it
[20:37:43] <ern> screenshot it
[20:37:48] <ern> read the docs, should be possible
[20:38:50] <Nasp> Yeah i'm not allowed to take screenshot of the app
[20:38:56] <Nasp> It's blocking it

[20:53:05] <ern> How will it work when you travel? do you NEED to have roaming on your phone to show the QR at border passage?
[20:53:19] <ern> I mean, showing the QR in USA will cost as much as the flight over just in roaming charges
