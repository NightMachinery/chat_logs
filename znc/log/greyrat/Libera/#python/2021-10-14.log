[00:13:27] <Avaris> I have a code that uses pickle as cache. One of the classes that's pickled looks like this: `C(data, config)` where `config` is a dict that's passed to objects and it can change between runs. I'm trying to avoid pickling it but also replace it with the `config` at unpickling time.

[00:18:06] <SnoopJ> what's the underlying distribution?
[00:18:13] <Cracki> unknown/empirical
[00:18:30] <Cracki> actually arbitrary. it's a grayscale histogram
[00:19:19] <Cracki> this isn't exactly interpolation either because I'm not looking for an y' given x0, y0, x1, y1 and x'
[00:19:54] <Cracki> I could whip this up with some masking/comparison and np.nonzero() but I'd hope there's something for this use case already
[00:20:07] <SnoopJ> the `statistics` module defines inv_cdf() if you know what distribution to use, but if you don't want to have a prior about that, I think it's probably more than the module knows how to do
[00:20:30] <Cracki> don't latch on to that
[00:20:31] <Avaris> why isn't this interpolation?

[00:21:41] <SnoopJ> Cracki, my guess at doing this in a fancypants way without a prior would be doing a kernel density estimation first
[00:21:55] <LiaoTao> If the distribution is monotone you are looking at a binary search plus an averaging
[00:22:05] <SnoopJ> but if you're willing to roll your own, yea, the above is reasonable
[00:22:06] <Cracki> it's monotone (*cumulative* intending to imply that)
[00:22:14] <SnoopJ> yea, probability is semipositive definite

[00:23:13] <InPhase> Cracki: You can do this with np as well.  With adjustments to handle no True values, something like:  np.argwhere(np.array([1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10]) >= 5)[0][0]
[00:23:34] <SnoopJ> InPhase, with the caveat that you're making some implicit assumptions about the underlying distribution, right?
[00:23:42] <Cracki> you say "bisect.bisect"... that's actually a python builtin module! I think I'll try np.searchsorted too

[00:24:54] <SnoopJ> if your sample density is good (or you can say it's reasonable for your data based on domain knowledge) it should be okay
[00:25:22] <SnoopJ> it would potentially be a very silly thing to do for a highly skewed distribution, say.
[00:25:48] <InPhase> Once you've found the index you can opt for other interpolations of course.
[00:25:49] <SnoopJ> although if you have samples out in the tail, the mean value theorem gives you *some* comfort
[00:26:07] <InPhase> Or even extrapolations if you have a guess of functional form.
[00:26:23] <ba> Hi! How should I provide usernames/passwords to my Python script in CI? I've heard that: 1) CLI arguments are a bad idea (can be read with `ps`) 2) Env vars are a bad idea (propagate to entire process tree, can be accidentally serialized 3) Files are a bad idea (e.g. `.netrc`). So, what _should_ I be doing? Thanks!

[00:27:59] <ChrisWarrick> ba: env vars are the easiest to work with, and what accidental serialization do you have in mind?
[00:28:04] <ammar2> most of them have secret management built in, and usually put them in environmental variables

[00:28:37] <SnoopJ> ba, "X is a bad idea" is a hard brush to paint with. The data does have to live somewhere, it's about picking the place it lives so that it minimizes risk.
[00:28:47] <ba> ChrisWarrick: a test might run `printenv` or something
[00:28:49] <ba> OK, thanks!
[00:29:01] <ChrisWarrick> ba: who writes the test code?
[00:29:10] <sartan> what i've done which may not be perfect is a config.py file with exports like username=foo that is inserted during the build process
[00:29:22] <LiaoTao> FWIW Kubernetes offers both environmental variables and files with secrets
[00:29:24] <SnoopJ> Or if you haven't already, consider if you could write your tests not to need sensitive creds (i.e. could you mock the DB for parts of it?)
[00:29:25] <ChrisWarrick> ba: if itâ€™s someone trustworthy, I wouldnâ€™t worry about the env vars being printed
[00:29:27] <LiaoTao> So it's "state of the art"
[00:29:52] <SnoopJ> we use both env vars and files at $employer, and they are restricted to the Jenkins system
[00:30:02] <sartan> yeah, using jenkins for credential storage.
[00:30:04] <ba> On that point, is there any sort of generic library that will load credentials from the environment and supply them to `requests` and friends? Or is that too niche/simple for a library?
[00:30:21] <sartan> ba: same approach with the config.py, get_username() can be implemented however you wish
[00:30:22] <ba> By "library" I mean PyPI package, sorry.

[04:05:15] <SnoopJ> cuppajoeman, numpy doesn't really have the concept of "row" or "column", that's just a 1D array. Do you want something with shape (14, 1) ?
[04:05:18] <Repiphany_> They behave like either depending on the orientation and order
[04:05:28] <Repiphany_> Er, operation, not orientation
[04:05:30] <cuppajoeman> SnoopJ: Yes!
[04:05:46] <cuppajoeman> Well, (1, 14) if possible
[04:05:58] <SnoopJ> cuppajoeman, `arr.reshape((1, -1))` will do it, or `arr[np.newaxis, :]`
[04:06:31] <cuppajoeman> Could you explain what the -1 does?
[04:06:58] <InPhase> cuppajoeman: To match that dimension to what's left.
[04:06:59] <SnoopJ> "make this axis whatever size it needs to be to accommodate the size of the array along with the other sizes I gave you"
[04:07:14] <cuppajoeman> I see
[04:07:15] <SnoopJ> you could just as well do reshape((1, 14)) but it's a little unhygienic when what you really mean is "the rest"

[04:08:37] <cuppajoeman> Right

[04:19:28] <SnoopJ> cuppajoeman, they're often used interchangeably, but numpy doesn't really care what N is, all its arrays are N-D arrays
[04:19:35] <Repiphany> np.matrix is being deprecated though
[04:19:50] <SnoopJ> It's all just 1D in memory as far as numpy is concerned, and it pretends things are such-and-such shape when asked to do so, using a bunch of pointer arithmetic.
[04:20:16] <SnoopJ> (this is pretty much how N-D arrays have always been implemented; C and Fortran both have pretty much the same idea, although not all the quality-of-life stuff)
[04:21:00] <cuppajoeman> cool, like if I say index i, j in an n by d matrix then it's gonna compute d * j * (size of type) + i * (size of type) ?
[04:21:02] <SnoopJ> cuppajoeman, the "basics" part of numpy's docs are full of *very* useful information, I cannot recommend reading them enough. https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.html
[04:21:28] <cuppajoeman> Ah ok, I need to sit down with that
[04:22:06] <SnoopJ> cuppajoeman, when two things aren't exactly the same shape, it does what's called a "broadcast" operation to figure out how to stretch the two arrays to be compatible. That's described very well here: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/theory.broadcasting.html#array-broadcasting-in-numpy
[04:22:39] <SnoopJ> it has been my experience that knowledge of these basics is what separates "can use numpy" from "can make numpy sing"
[04:23:12] <SnoopJ> knowing what the library's doing on your behalf helps you avoid some expensive mistakes (usually cases where you make a copy and don't _have_ to)

[04:26:32] <SnoopJ> cuppajoeman, if you ask numpy to do a binary operation (one that eats two arrays) and they aren't exactly the same shape, the only options it has are 1) blow up and error 2) try to 'make' them compatible

[08:57:50] <SnoopJ> but when it comes to performance, the most general rule is to know enough about ndarray to figure out what's going under the hood, and to measure things relentlessly :)
[08:58:24] <QuaternionsRock> Oh I meant mgrid not meshgrid haha
[08:58:30] <QuaternionsRock> I get the two confused all the time
[08:58:31] <SnoopJ> and to remember that measurements might not be the same across systems, since there's so much runtime variation! Intel MKL vs. OpenBLAS etc.
[08:59:05] <QuaternionsRock> Yeah... unfortunately I don't have the patience most of the time
[08:59:15] <SnoopJ> I think I end up using meshgrid a lot more often, which might be a little wasteful, but generation is rarely a bottleneck for those programs
[08:59:44] <QuaternionsRock> I try very hard to find the fastest solution before I start writing code because I'll rarely go back and try other things if it works well enough
[08:59:52] <SnoopJ> nditer would be a better choice if you were doing something over a grid that can go straight to a reduced answer (i.e. no need to store the whole thing in memory as an intermediate step)
[09:00:07] <QuaternionsRock> Makes sense
[09:00:08] <SnoopJ> better in terms of resources used, that is. Substantially worse in terms of complexity.
[09:00:27] * SnoopJ usually goes crosseyed when he sees nditer code

[09:17:43] <SnoopJ> Looks like a configuration problem with the Docker container that runs autoconf, Pablo put in a PR so I thiiink it will be fixed whenever that lands.
[09:18:04] <SnoopJ> (and hopefully the container just moves into CPython as he suggests)

[09:23:20] <SnoopJ> ede, running `autoreconf -ivf` before configuration might fix the ssl problem, if you have `autoconf automake autoconf-archive pkgconfig` installed. It will regenerate configure without this flaw.

[13:18:53] <w0rp> I've just realised that there ought to be a type more general than tuple for typing. Why not a type like Seqeuence with known types at each index? You can't express a type for ['foo', 1] exactly, but you can for ('foo', 1). For the former the best you have is list[Union[str, int]] and for the latter you have tuple[str, int].
[13:19:26] <w0rp> TypeScript uses Array as tuples, so you have just `[string, number]` in TS.
[13:19:53] <w0rp> Only comes up because if you convert a tuple to JSON and back again you get a list.

[14:29:19] <blackbit> question regarding socket communication. with a straight socket server (socket.socket(), bind(), listen(), recv()) one calls recv() until it returns 0, since whatever the sender transmitted could have been fragmented or is larger than the recv buffer, right? so far so good. when i want to do a socket server in an async way, the example in the docs
[14:29:21] <blackbit> https://docs.python.org/3/library/selectors.html#examples suggest to call recv() just once. it seems to me like that doesn't ensure i read everything the sender transmitted. of course i'll get another EVENT_READ and can read again, but how do i then detect that a transmission from the sender has ended? or am i not supposed to care about that?
[14:30:14] <bjs> blackbit: you asked this earlier didn't you?    like supakeen said,  this example doesn't care that it didn't receive the whole message, it just echos back partial messages

[15:35:06] <Masklin_Gurder> mawk: Why what? I mean that it's highly unlikely the random module didn't have a method or function specifically for sampling with replacement.
[15:35:18] <Masklin_Gurder> So I was suspicious at the first answer.

Then it was too late to remove them and only provide class methods.)"

[21:34:24] <joel135> i can't copy and paste all cells, even just to get them into emacs. some cells can be copied, but not others. so i think some cells are broken for some reason. i am using plotly in this notebook. maybe that's the culprit.
[21:34:51] <bjs> whatsupdoc: staticmethod exists for a reason,  but it's usually a classmethod that you actually want when you want to write a "static" method
[21:35:03] <grym> (or a module function)
[21:35:34] <grym> guido's quote i lifted out above is from a discussion about that sort of thing, i think; they seem to go hand in hand
[21:35:56] <foo> grym: so. much. nicer. glom(e[0], 'other.Line.0.AccountBasedExpenseLineDetail.CustomerRef.value')
[21:36:04] <bjs> whatsupdoc: classmethod is basically like staticmethod except it makes sure the class itself gets passed in,  which if the method really is a part of the class is an important thing in a language with inheritance

[23:07:47] <hexology> it might be interesting to fork off a "python-kernel" distribution :) probably more maintenance work than it's worth as a proof of concept, though
[23:07:49] <aphysically> configparser is nice that it's in stdlib
[23:08:10] <Julian> SnoopJ: the relevance was "here is a module for which I claim more people recognize its uselessness and it still hasn't disappeared"
[23:08:10] <SnoopJ> I am aware of at least one project that used it as a terrible proxy for a TOML parser (pydantic-mypy)
[23:08:29] <aphysically> it's a bit awkward for a few data types though like arrays (configparser is I mean)
[23:08:32] <SnoopJ> Julian, and that is an entirely separate issue from "I hope stdlib gets a TOML parser"
[23:08:41] <Julian> (whereas fewer people proportionately I think believe INI is *bad*, even if they think others are better)
[23:08:42] <CrtxReavr> And despite what most believe, configparser supports arrays.

[23:09:46] <SnoopJ> it does seem like a massive oversight to roll out a configuration format for which there is no stdlib parser
[23:09:56] <hexology> i don't really have an opinion on the toml format itself, or its merits for/against relative to other similar formats
[23:10:02] <SnoopJ> but there is at least rich discussion of it

[23:11:39] <velix> isinstance(data, (bytes, bytearray)) gives me true on both :)

[23:12:43] <velix> hexology: I had that. it then complains if bytearray occures.
[23:12:44] <Julian> SnoopJ: My point is less that something needs to be internally useful -- json is already *in* the stdlib, so it's 0 work to add it -- my point is more that the current initiative wasn't really meant to *add* new things to the stdlib, packaging is trying to fix itself
[23:12:50] <hexology> velix: complains how?
[23:12:54] <velix> hexology: 1 sec
[23:13:03] <Julian> SnoopJ: So I think the fact that packaging picked TOML and didn't add a toml parser to the stdlib is strictly "let's do less work"
[23:13:04] <SnoopJ> Julian, that is how we got here, yes. I think it will be a mistake if a parser is never added.
[23:13:22] <Julian> SnoopJ: Got it, I probably agree with that unless the stdlib decides to dismantle itself (which I hope it does)
[23:13:30] <stealth_> velix, better to juse use `bytes(data)` vs checking, since only different is read-only vs read-write

[23:26:15] <rendar> the thing is: i have those dataframe all allocated in memory and are VERY big, like 32Gb
[23:26:22] <hexology> see https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/development/extending.html and https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.api.extensions.ExtensionArray.html#pandas.api.extensions.ExtensionArray
[23:26:24] <rendar> i cannot reload them into child processes
[23:26:28] <rendar> i MUST share them.. :(
[23:26:34] <hexology> you have to be very careful not to do copying operations then
[23:26:53] <SnoopJ> hexology, TIL ExtensionArray, thanks
[23:27:04] <rendar> hexology, but i can't even *have* them
[23:27:06] <hexology> what are you doing with them in the child processes? if they are all numeric dtypes, you _can_ just operate on the underlying numpy arrays
[23:27:08] <SnoopJ> kinda surprised the interface doesn't include __array__
[23:27:11] <rendar> since i don't know how to share DataFrames

[23:27:57] <rendar> yes, also that
[23:28:11] <hexology> like, you have an "X" which is a numeric matrix, and a "y" which is an array of labels?

[23:28:51] *** Joins: srhm (~srhm@user/srhm)
[23:29:11] <hexology> my suggestion is to _not_ try to memmap the pandas dataframe then, but to load the "X" stuff as a numpy ndarray and the "Y" stuff as a numpy ndarray, and memmap those
[23:29:18] <rendar> basically i have multiples label->numeric array ..ordered by datetime
[23:29:25] <rendar> they are multiple timeseries
[23:29:35] <hexology> you might have to do all the data processing from dataframe -> arrays in a separate script
[23:30:09] <rendar> :(
[23:30:12] <hexology> i did find this dive into pandas and memmapping, but 1) it's a bit complicated, and 2) it's a few years old, and pandas internals might have changed since then: https://stackoverflow.com/a/47894784/2954547

[23:31:16] <hexology> yeah, although that specific answer probably does more work than you need to do, and it also doesn't take advantage of the "block" structure of pandas dataframes
[23:31:22] <hexology> incidentally, now i know what a blockmanager is!
[23:31:27] <hexology> > Contrary to the docs, DataFrame is NOT a collection of series but a collection of similarly dtyped matrices. BlockManger groups all the float columns together, all the int columns together, etc..., and their memory (from what I can tell) is kept together.
[23:31:30] *** Quits: arfy (~arfy@1.126.110.217) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:31:36] <hexology> which makes a lot of sense
[23:31:59] <hexology> so if your data is all one dtype, your entire dataframe should be one "block", and is or can be backed by a single numpy array
[23:32:00] <rendar> yes i see

[23:38:07] <SnoopJ> Probably ties into some of the open NEPs as well, I know numpy has been working on similar ideas from their end
