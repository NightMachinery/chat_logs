[13:53:28] <bullgard4> What is the difference between "data processing" and "handling of data"? (Both are Jargon, or "technical terms", if you like.)
[13:59:20] <drogas> the former implies an expected output whereas the latter does not necessarily.

[19:54:46] <blkshp> I see what you mean now!
[19:54:47] <placeb0> American English is also English
[19:55:00] <blkshp> Yeah, I wasn't trying to say that it wasn't xD

[19:56:12] <placeb0> ah ok

[19:57:45] <huf> as we've discovered, blkshp is already in a tin
[19:58:07] <huf> also in a gland
[19:58:18] <huf> .... glandular *shudder*
[19:58:18] <TimMc> huf: 🤯
[19:59:04] <TimMc> I'm American, blkshp is Englandular?
[20:00:06] <huf> glands should by and large be kept out of the public sphere, I feel

[20:35:06] <TimMc> I'm having trouble understanding. Can you give an example?

[20:57:20] <bleb> established by sustained practice could also work depending on context
[20:57:21] <|\n> TimMc, well the context is following: there is a process gap in the organization, that is still remediated through something that exists on practice in evident form, but without formal description of it
[20:58:31] <|\n> the latter leads to necessity of explanations on why some things should be processed one way or another solely for valid argumentation purpose and highlight
[20:58:45] <bleb> (Sorry, forgot we capitalize and punctuate here.)
