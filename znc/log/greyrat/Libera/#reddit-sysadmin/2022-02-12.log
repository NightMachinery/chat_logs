[02:57:52] <Molnija> true true
[02:58:22] <yuken> Hunterkll, do you have any clue how to install a mauser claw extractor? I can't fuckin get it.
[02:58:27] <Hunterkll> now mind you, depending on what kind of controller it is, you could end up with 1.5gbit sata links instead of 3gbit, etc
[02:58:36] <Hunterkll> yuken: well first i'd go on youtube
[02:58:41] <yuken> no help there.
[02:58:46] <Hunterkll> and/or pull up old soviet manuals
[02:58:50] <yuken> this
[02:58:52] <yuken> isn't a soviet item.
[02:59:04] <yuken> it was made before the soviet union existed.
[02:59:42] <Hunterkll> Molnija: so like, if you have a SATA3 6gbit drive, on a 6gbit SAS controller, normally the SAS controller will only run SATA drives at SATA2 (3gbit) link speeds 
[03:00:17] <Hunterkll> that's of especial note when you start atlking about SSDs
[03:00:37] <Hunterkll> like the Dell H310 controller (forget what the SAS2XXX chip on it is, but i've reflashed a ton) does 6gbit sas, 3gbit sata
[03:00:50] <yuken> I think I need to bend the extractor.
[03:02:33] <monr0e> yuken: Is this what you're after? at 5:20 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1fcu6AIyas

[03:09:40] <Hunterkll> Molnija: it's just like saying why isn't SCSI used everywhere when IDE was in consumer systems
[03:09:48] <Hunterkll> SCSI and SAS are more complex and expensive 
[03:10:01] <Hunterkll> larger feature set, differences in protocols, designed for different usage
[03:10:16] <Molnija> mm
[03:10:21] <Hunterkll> SATA has added some SAS things over time (such as NCQ, etc) but not nearly all
[03:10:33] <Hunterkll> you can't hook one SATA drive physically to two different controllers/host systems
[03:10:33] <Hunterkll> :D

[03:14:22] <Hunterkll> Molnija: oh yea, with SAS you can use multiple ports/channels to get higher bandwidth connectivity, can't do that with SATA
[03:14:48] <Hunterkll> like, my server has 48gbit of connectivity to my two daisy chained disk shelves
[03:15:02] <Hunterkll> redundant, mind you, so you only *expect* 24 in case of a link/cable failure 
[03:15:11] <Molnija> smart.
[03:15:18] <Hunterkll> but also, if the link bridging the two disk shelves together fails, you have 24gbps to each disk shelve
[03:15:20] <Hunterkll> and don't lose connectivity

[03:45:21] <CptLuxx> war mongers 
[03:45:29] <Hunterkll> USA didn't say that 
[03:45:31] <Hunterkll> regardless
[03:45:42] <Hunterkll> the russians wouldn't move at all either way until the ground is frozen solid

[03:46:42] <Cl0udNinja> How to defend Ukraine: 1) Build a large mudbog around the russian border
[03:46:44] <Hunterkll> but the whole after olympics thing is because of the stated end of some russian exercises/timing/etc

[03:46:54] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: sooo.... giant heated driveway across the border then?
[03:47:00] <CptLuxx> because thats how it works?
[03:47:05] <Hunterkll> Hobadee: because in non-war scenarios in shared airspace that's what you do?

[03:47:23] <Hunterkll> even though they flew higher than anyone else could 
[03:47:24] <Hunterkll> lol

[04:01:58] <Hunterkll> Molnija: both yes and no
[04:02:05] <Hunterkll> ATAPI 
[04:02:07] <Molnija> yep
[04:02:19] <Molnija> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATA_Packet_Interface
[04:02:34] <Hunterkll> encapsulation of limited SCSI stuff
[04:12:26] <Hunterkll> fun part is that a lot of time it's the host OS handling the translation of whta gets encapsulated
[04:12:48] <Hunterkll> for a fun time, look into sound card cdrom interfaces or other cdrom controllers
[04:13:39] <Molnija> so, it's more of a hybrid between ATA and SCSI, than pure SCSI over (S)ATA.
[04:13:49] <Molnija> am i wrong?
[04:14:36] <Hunterkll> well
[04:14:41] <Hunterkll> it's just a packet encapsulation interface really

[04:19:38] <Hunterkll> essentially right though 
[04:19:56] <Molnija> in practice sure
[04:20:10] <Hunterkll> really, it's an ATA extension

[04:22:18] <Hunterkll> doable with SAS

[04:22:34] <Hunterkll> since SATA is strictly host/device

[04:25:07] <Hunterkll> Molnija: again, you'd need a SATA controller that can negotiate to another SATA controller as if it were a client device to establish the link, and the equivelent of a SATA crossover cable 
[04:25:12] <Hunterkll> like you would with internet  pre-autoMDIX
[04:25:15] <Molnija> aha
[04:25:17] <Hunterkll> ethernet, not internet
[04:25:38] <Molnija> ... oooorr you would need a device that acted as two different devices but just, like, bridged them?
[04:25:40] <Hunterkll> Molnija: now, you could build a device, just like i said with USB, that acts as a SATA device/client to both sides, and translates/hands over the data
[04:25:41] <Hunterkll> yes
[04:25:49] <Molnija> ye

[06:55:29] <sd> 04<Mâ€‹ayhem> the drive backplane does have a weird one

[06:56:34] <Hunterkll> weird how?
[06:56:46] <Hunterkll> it's just a standard SFF sas connector
[06:56:50] <Molnija> it just appears to be this big ass socket, standing useless next to the raid card whomst sees all the storage action
[06:57:25] <Molnija> there isn't a SHRED of information anywhere in the owner's handbook

[07:00:19] <Hunterkll> you won't really find it anywhere
[07:00:34] <Hunterkll> well, you could, it's probably a standard connector of some type, but you'd be making your own cables
[07:00:41] <sd> 04<Mâ€‹ayhem> I've noticed, even the cable I have has to have the header rewired to work iwith it,
[07:00:53] <Molnija> I've scoured the handbook. All it says in the whirlwind tour of the MB is that it's "SAS/SATA connector 0". https://systemx.lenovofiles.com/help/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.lenovo.sysx.8869.doc%2Fc_dimm_sparing.html

[07:02:51] <Molnija> is it, like, for the rear drives?
[07:03:13] <Hunterkll> nah
[07:03:23] <Hunterkll> given the positioning
[07:03:35] <Hunterkll> i think it might be for if you have it wit hout a raid con troller
[07:03:39] <Hunterkll> the chipset's built in sata controller
[07:04:11] <Molnija> well, yes
[07:04:14] <Hunterkll> if the bios has config sections for sata stuff unrelated to the raid controller in the slot, it's likely that's what it is 
[07:04:21] <Hunterkll> because that, also, looks like an sff-8087 jack
[07:04:28] <Hunterkll> which means 4 sata ports or 4 sas channels
[07:04:37] <Molnija> i thought it was something like that.
[07:07:08] <Molnija> of course, if i was to break that out, i'd then need to find somewhere to get sata or sas power. that's not trivial on an Absolutely Proprietary board.

[07:19:40] <PattyCakes> to be honest though Hunterkll, it really is like playing house on easy mode. Start with a shit hole, learn as you go - just don't fuck with the structure

[09:04:23] <Hunterkll> @Mitchy93 the D4 also tells you the current time / total charge time when finished of a cell

[09:08:57] <Hunterkll> @Mitchy93 but if you want to get a new charger, I'd go for the SC4 or the UMS4
[09:09:04] <Hunterkll> for something like what you have, but better
[09:09:21] <Cl0udNinja> Hunterkll, also ngl, I opened google and searched the youtube video id instead of clickin the link
[09:09:41] <Hunterkll> SC4 can do up to 6 amps charging current across all 4 slots (300ma-3A for two cells) and you can *manually* set the charge current
[09:09:52] <sd> 02<Mâ€‹itchy93> Many thanks

[09:11:45] <Hunterkll> yea the SC4 is the cadillac one of the 4 cell chargers, and its only $50 or so 
[09:11:59] <Hunterkll> the i4's the cheapest bare bones model 
[09:12:47] <Hunterkll> actually it seems, the SC4 is their most expensive charger LOL

[09:55:43] <Cl0udNinja> Mitchy93 yeah thats also why I turn my main monitor off and tilt it away. I still have TV/hulu or a movie goin on during work, but 80% of the time I ignore it or its just background noise
[09:55:52] <yuken> I would snort wasabi if given the chance.
[09:55:54] <yuken> It's so good.

[12:05:21] <PattyCakes> I wouldn't cosign though honestly
[12:05:25] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: however, i get into situations with how i travel, i'm basically at home 6mos out of the year 
[12:05:32] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: oh i would , she'll die before me 
[12:05:41] <Hunterkll> wow that's m orbid as fuck
[12:05:49] <PattyCakes> it makes things messy, that's why I bought my half instead of my mom inheriting it. So while she
[12:05:58] <PattyCakes> she'll live here, and have a say-ish
[12:06:04] <PattyCakes> the final say is mine
[12:06:12] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: oh no, i put a joint ownership agreement/path out first when my dad said it in front of my mom
[12:06:15] <Hunterkll> and she agred
[12:06:23] <Hunterkll> so there'd be contracts, paperwork, wills, etc 
[12:06:26] <PattyCakes> yea, just structure it right
[12:06:39] <PattyCakes> remove any ambuguity, because money fucks up everything
[12:06:48] <Hunterkll> so if i croak first, they get it, if mom croaks, i get it all
[12:06:52] <Hunterkll> oh yea
[12:06:56] <Hunterkll> mom jsut went through that shit
[12:07:04] <PattyCakes> I'm in that point right now, my uncle owns 50%, he's legally entitled to a full 50%
[12:07:08] <Hunterkll> one of her siblings tried to fuck the estate of our grandfather
[12:07:09] <PattyCakes> but if I put my money into it to renovate
[12:07:13] <PattyCakes> he doesn't HAVE to pay 50%
[12:07:28] <PattyCakes> so like, I can hope he won't be an ass and work through this reasonably
[12:07:33] <Hunterkll> mom's sibling got laughed out of court
[12:07:41] <Hunterkll> so she knows how it can be 
[12:07:42] <PattyCakes> but I'm not gonna broach that subject until I have a cash sum available to be like
[12:07:49] <PattyCakes> "here how much I have in cash, it's yours today - sign this form"
[12:07:58] <Hunterkll> so she knows i'm not gonna come to the table without a lawyer and paperwork
[12:08:36] <Hunterkll> and that's fine with her (and my dad too) because we both want to be equitable in this type of s ituation
[12:08:38] <PattyCakes> cause like, money talks. I could run through different scenarios with him, but if I show up to a sit down and say "here's a check for $55k, take it, cash it, and the your 50% is now mine"
[12:08:43] <Hunterkll> now, my siblings? who knows what they'll do 
[12:08:46] <PattyCakes> no closing, no realtor costs no liability no nothing
[12:08:54] <Hunterkll> my sister's awsome but you know how that can turn sower
[12:09:13] <PattyCakes> is his half worth more than 50k? Sure. Do I think he'll drool oiver a 50k check? absolutely
[12:09:13] <Hunterkll> so yea
[12:09:27] <Hunterkll> my mom knows i'll lawyer up in that kinda situation 
[12:09:37] <Hunterkll> but only to make it equitable 
[12:09:43] <PattyCakes> I want to be reasonable. my grandma did NOT leave this house in great shape
[12:09:53] <Hunterkll> absolutely
[12:09:59] <PattyCakes> I've put a LOT of money in already. Before I go put 200k into a new garage/apartment
[12:10:02] <PattyCakes> I'm going to own 100%
[12:10:15] <Hunterkll> my mom nearely got fucked over in esteate shit recently
[12:10:30] <PattyCakes> or at the enf of the day, an agreement can't be reached and we just sell
[12:10:31] <Hunterkll> so she's got it fresh in her mind what happens if you don't lay it down clear
[12:10:34] <PattyCakes> split the money 50/50
[12:10:40] <PattyCakes> and I lose that part of my family
[12:10:54] <Hunterkll> well yea
[12:10:56] <PattyCakes> because he'd not only be forcing out me, but also his sister

[21:12:15] <A-KO> you probably did it wrong
[21:12:19] <Emet-Selch> ^
[21:12:30] <A-KO> and PRTG? is that some external service?
[21:12:35] <A-KO> external services won't validate an internal CA
[21:12:42] <lantech19446> I generated a self-signed certificate in IIS and then used the prtg tool to import it
[21:12:46] <A-KO> yes that's incorrect
[21:12:51] <A-KO> that's why it won't validate
[21:12:51] <lantech19446> no it runs on a server inside the domain
[21:12:55] <A-KO> self-signed is almost never going to validate
[21:13:01] <A-KO> that's why you stand up an AD Enterprise CA
[21:13:02] <lantech19446> prtg is a really good network monitor
[21:13:21] <lantech19446> oi ok
[21:13:22] <A-KO> google how to manage an AD enterprise CA
[21:13:39] <A-KO> pretty much almost every AD environment these days should be stood up with: ADDS, ADCS, and ADFS

[21:15:08] <A-KO> this is why I almost inevitably advocate not doing this anymore
[21:15:11] <A-KO> and just using cloud shit
[21:15:13] <A-KO> call it a day
[21:15:16] <lantech19446> I don't use federation services I was under the impression that was for larger networks
[21:15:26] <A-KO> there are very few situations where you need an internal AD anymore
[21:15:30] <A-KO> just use cloud on anything small
[21:16:02] <A-KO> get some O365 E3 licenses or E5 if you're being fancy, and call it a day
[21:16:13] <A-KO> use autopilot, AAD join, etc.
[21:16:47] <lantech19446> yea we get O365 for free I've looked at azureAD but it looks like it's intended to be used only for cloud services
[21:16:59] <A-KO> you can literally AAD join a Windows 10/11 machine
[21:17:12] <A-KO> and everyone gets Windows Hello access right out the gate, onedrive, Sharepoint, and Office 365
[21:17:17] <A-KO> and you can sign into windows with the AAD Account
[21:17:25] <shibboleth> really? msft client os can be joined to msft cloud services?
[21:17:27] <shibboleth> holy cow
[21:17:44] <shibboleth> i mean, that's the final nail in the coffin for linux
[21:17:45] <lantech19446> but how does it integrate into group policy etc
[21:17:56] <A-KO> you use Intune to manage policies instead of GPO
[21:18:11] <A-KO> it can't do *everything* GPO can do, sadly; but it gets most of the way there. And they are working to fix that.
[21:18:46] <A-KO> you device enroll and manage the devices using intune
[21:19:00] <A-KO> set your users up with MFA, use company portal to manage their personal devices/data.
[21:19:24] <A-KO> autopilot will help configure the system as soon as you connect it to AAD/Intune
[21:19:44] <A-KO> for anything small I'd use that, particularly if you need no need for on-premises file servers. And there's even a way to do that with AAD now
[21:20:52] <lantech19446> I wonder if we can get intune for free too, like a donation or whatever
[21:20:54] <A-KO> for shit that needs LDAP, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/auth-ldap, just do that.

[21:22:44] <A-KO> I'm more or less considered an AD expert and even I steer shit towards the cloud these days. There's almost no reason at all to use on-premises shit unless you're a very large, entrenched organization, and moving everything would cost more than it's worth to do so.
[21:23:30] <A-KO> in fact, sometime today once I'm finished adulting I'm going to be spending quality time training myself on more azure shit :D
[21:23:33] <lantech19446> I'll definitely look into it. it's really going to depend on getting intune for free and can it do everything I need it to do

[21:24:47] <lantech19446> I was afraid of doing the azure training I didn't want to get charged for shit so i let it go I have the same fear with aws too
[21:25:02] <A-KO> you should be almost exclusively starting with cloud at this point.
[21:25:31] <A-KO> There are a lot of major/large organizations that are still primarily on-premise. but I think they will be at a huge security disadvantage here soon. They technically already are they just don't know it.
[21:26:07] <A-KO> The amount of logging, control, and capability you get in AAD is unmatched on on-premises tech. Just hands down.
[21:26:25] <A-KO> it's a thousand times easier to implement even the simplest of security controls
[21:26:39] <A-KO> which ultimately means a more secure environment
