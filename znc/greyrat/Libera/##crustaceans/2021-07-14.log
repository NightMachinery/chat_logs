[00:04:05] <Church> Man the culture clash between east and west coast is... interesting
[00:04:11] <Church> As we mix with the new overlord corp
[00:06:36] <companion_cube> we talking about swing dancing right?
[00:06:54] <bkero> I think it's vim vs emacs
[00:07:19] <gerikson> hey nix people
[00:07:43] <riv> hi
[00:07:45] <gerikson> I'm having an ... "interesting" discussuin with someone who's obsessed with booting a linux system from scratch, from source
[00:07:54] <gerikson> and distrusts binary packages
[00:07:55] <riv> on libera?
[00:08:04] <gerikson> can nix offer a "middle ground"?
[00:08:13] <companion_cube> does this person also hate systemd
[00:08:15] <gerikson> binary, but "proven" to be compiled from source
[00:08:20] <gerikson> companion_cube: take a wild guess
[00:08:27] <companion_cube> yes? :D
[00:08:35] <gerikson> and it's on irc.Techrights.org
[00:08:40] <riv> oh
[00:08:41] <companion_cube> oh
[00:08:45] <companion_cube> then templeOS all the wasy
[00:08:46] <companion_cube> way
[00:08:50] <gerikson> let me find a representtative quote
[00:09:08] <companion_cube> do they think linus is a SJW cuck now?
[00:10:25] <riv> gerikson, but yeah I think that is definitely a property nix gives you
[00:10:49] <riv> because things are built in containers are hashed, multiple build servers can verify a build and so on
[00:11:06] <riv> the produced of compilation is supposed to be a pure function of the build recipe
[00:11:35] <riv> of course you have to get nix set up first, you'll always have to accept some blob to bootstrap
[00:14:15] <gerikson> riv: ta
[00:14:26] <gerikson> ok here is the quote (near the end) http://simp.ly/publish/097Q5l
[00:14:27] <buttsbot> activelow dbus musl
[00:14:33] <gerikson> he's a real-life Ossie
[00:15:45] <riv> musl sometimes attracts interesting people
[00:15:58] <riv> im tryig to figure out if this is the same person I know, but different nick
[00:16:06] <companion_cube> and he hates dbus too
[00:16:08] <companion_cube> ofc
[00:16:15] <riv> I think not, this time
[00:22:05] <Church> companion_cube: heh
[00:25:43] <gerikson> riv: this person identifies as a German citizen, rpobably born in the old East
[00:28:23] <Church> gerikson: Hey if I had to deal with the stasi I'd not trust anything I didn't make either.
[00:29:11] <companion_cube> that's a reason to write your own kernel
[00:29:23] <companion_cube> not write a 2000-nostalgia linux from scratch :)
[00:29:35] <companion_cube> and the only realistic way to do that is to adapt Oberon
[00:32:04] <Church> Heheh
[00:32:51] <gerikson> Church: oh, he's Ostalgic
[00:34:19] <gerikson> 20:55 < activelow> nonetheless 16million people establishing a fully operation military-industrial complex including microchip production is noteworthy
[00:34:49] <companion_cube> who did?

[16:12:17] <geoffwozniak> It was pretty warm for the last three days
[16:12:41] <gerikson> we've got 30C here
[16:12:43] <gerikson> but not humid
[16:12:56] <gerikson> quite pleasant if you can sit in the shade
[16:13:39] <geoffwozniak> We were up north a ways and it was about about 28C

[18:14:03] <epilys> gerikson, financial theory (keynes etc) say that inflation is scary if you own capital, so it's scary for hn folk
[18:14:31] <gerikson> true
[18:20:16] <companion_cube> it's also scary if you have savings, no?
[18:21:23] <gerikson> if your savings are in cash or savings account, sure
[18:21:33] <gerikson> if they're in "productive" investments, not so much

[18:29:43] <companion_cube> right, let me open a twitter account… :p
[18:31:39] <gerikson> "inflation == bad" is a meme
[18:32:09] <gerikson> generally it's pushed by the well-off, becasue they a) have money, and b) lend it out to other people
[18:32:18] <gerikson> if you're in debt, inflation is beneficial
[18:32:58] <companion_cube> you call it a meme, I just call it my 3 years of savings shrinking :/
[18:33:56] <gerikson> serious, what are you saving for?
[18:35:13] <gerikson> I put in $$$ just when the pandemic hit in Mar 2020, that money has grown ~27%
[18:35:59] <gerikson> just some random stocks
[18:36:55] <indigo> Also it looks like the CPI increase is driven mostly by an increase in used car prices, which is not inflation but a chip shortage

[23:06:58] <geoffwozniak> Not sure it if was on floppy or CD
[23:07:04] <geoffwozniak> Probably floppy
[23:19:19] <cb> geoffwozniak: i see you've grown up considerably
[23:19:22] <cb> cool thesis tho
[23:19:28] <cb> i saw strongarm and my neurons acttivated
[23:20:12] <geoffwozniak> cb: heh - what page are you looking at?
[23:20:27] <geoffwozniak> And yeah, I used to be very pro open source stuff
[23:20:28] <cb> geoffwozniak: gerikson's old website
[23:20:31] <cb> hahaha
[23:20:36] <geoffwozniak> ahahah
[23:20:37] <cb> fucked again by tab complete
[23:20:43] <geoffwozniak> Stupid tab complete!
[23:21:23] <cb> if you really wanted to fuck with me you'd just become gwozniak and gustaferikson
[23:21:39] <cb> actually that might be better.... the second letter becomes distinct
[23:22:42] <geoffwozniak> I'll take it under consideration. Maybe I'll do that since it's a little shorter
[23:22:56] <geoffwozniak> And it was my original login on machines from years ago
[23:23:06] *** gerikson is now known as gustaf
[23:23:12] <gustaf> cb: ur welcome
[23:23:17] <geoffwozniak> Now I mainly use "woz" but that's not a good one to pick
[23:23:36] <cb> gustaf: i'm glad you've decided to make my life easier
[23:23:50] <cb> now i just need to remember not to type ge^I when i want to talk to you
[23:24:11] <cb> if we somehow get the two of you in a room together, will i address you by the right names irl
[23:36:19] <Geekingfrog> you can't tab-complete irl
[23:37:37] <gustaf> I really need AR glasses
[23:37:48] <gustaf> cos I can't connect faces to names
[23:55:06] <geoffwozniak> I'm generally bad at that too
