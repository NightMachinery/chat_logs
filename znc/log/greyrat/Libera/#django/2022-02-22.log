[02:15:58] <jim> hi, after I do "makemigrations", should I -commit- those migrations to git (assuming I'm also committing the output of django-admin startproject, and manage.py startapp)?
[02:17:00] <GinFuyou> Yes, absolutely. Migrations are part of your code, even if it was created fully automatically
[02:17:29] <jim> ok, let's see.
[02:18:19] <schinckel> Yeah, anyone who says otherwise should be spanked with wet seaweed.
[02:18:40] <jim> so I'm on part 2 of the tutorial, and there's an app polls with migrations... so I would add all files in the migrations?

[12:27:39] <pycode> hello everybody i have the main app called "core" and now i am going to create a new app called "feed" where i create .xml for external websites. I decided to put that part on a different app (feed indeed) because of its purpose. Now those feeds need data from a model inside the core app. This does not sounds really "reusable" app because it is strictly related to the "core" app. So i thought if there was a pattern to follow to
[12:27:39] <pycode> adapt this app to be indipendent to a specific model. Idk maybe implementing an "universal" method like get_data_for_feed()
[12:28:17] <pycode> can this solution be good? in that case if i need to reuse that app on another project i will change the model it is referring to and then call that method
[12:28:21] <pycode> could it be a solution?
[12:29:50] <pycode> or maybe this method get_data_For_feed is better inside a Manager, to return a queryset
[12:34:10] <FunkyBob> pycode: not everything must be reusable... sometimes code is just for this project.
[12:34:29] <pycode> FunkyBob, so basically does not care if i call the model directly

[17:12:22] <GinFuyou> Cell20, just use a network socket, not sure why you tried puting fastcgi with it
[17:12:25] <Cell20> Here it is https://github.com/RestyaPlatform/board/issues/1012
[17:13:39] <Cell20> i didnt i just searched the traceback which landed me there and ive also removed it
[17:15:06] <GinFuyou> I'm not following. Just replace your socket with your net socket, just drop fastcgi part
[17:16:03] <GinFuyou> I'm not aware if django works with fcgi at all? it's typically wsgi, uwsgi has own proto that can be used if you run that server
[17:18:50] <Wooble> support was removed in django 1.9
[17:19:21] <apollo13> well a fcgi -> wsgi adapter would still work
[17:19:30] <apollo13> that said, there is no good reason to use fcgi
[17:20:35] <GinFuyou> anyway it's outside of the topic. It matters where you declare proxy_pass or uwsgi_pass or whatever fits the server which is runing django aplication

[17:36:10] <Wooble> so you're just trying to run django under nginx on windows, and fcgi was just mentioned because these people were using it for PHP?
[17:36:25] <Cell20> yeah exactly
[17:37:31] <prodigius> Hmm... I use something very different but fcgi *could* work.
[17:39:53] <Wooble> tbh probably give up on nginx for windows, which is a beta, and just use apache+mod_wsgi
