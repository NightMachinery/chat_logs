[13:43:13] <The_Blode> Good morning PHPeons (PHPons?).
[13:43:15] <The_Blode> Quick one.
[13:43:43] <The_Blode> If I'm sending a variable back to a caller (Ajax or XMLHTTPRequest)...say it's the integer 10.
[13:44:06] <The_Blode> Does it matter if I use intval($var) or not as JavaScript will treat it as a string regardless right?
[13:44:26] <The_Blode> intval() usage is redundant here?

[13:51:34] <biberu> The_Blode: it depends on the context, but if it's a number it should probably be represented as such on the php side too
[13:52:33] <biberu> The_Blode: if you're e.g. encoding it as json it could come out as either 10 or "10", and those are different

[13:55:39] <The_Blode> I see your point. Thanks bib.

[13:56:10] <The_Blode> Let me check if it is JSON.
[13:58:52] <biberu> The_Blode: also, note that on the js side 10 will be treated as a number, that's a floating point type and an integer in php might be outside of the range it can represent
[14:00:23] <biberu> The_Blode: so if you're working with very large numbers you may actually want to export them as strings (while probably still treating them as numbers inside your php application, your api might need to do some conversion between internal types and what goes on the wire)

[17:42:04] <remolej> biberu you can sure buts its hardly recommended
[17:42:09] <stenno> Swoole is a high-performance network framework based on an event-driven, asynchronous, non-blocking I/O coroutine programming model for PHP.
[17:42:28] <stenno> why not just use javascript :thinking:
[17:42:35] <biberu> remolej: what's the reason for that recommendation?
[17:42:56] <stenno> given that its an event-driven, asnychronous, non-blocking I/O coroutine programming language
[17:43:14] <biberu> or why not just something sane?
[17:43:15] <remolej> stenno but why should we? if its possible in php now?
[17:43:47] <stenno> because just because its 'possible' doesn't mean its well programmed or well-integrated into the language
[17:43:50] <biberu> remolej: i think you're interpreting that guideline a bit rigidly
[17:44:16] <remolej> stenno and thats what everyone and their grandma has been doing the last 8 or so years - migrating to node.js. do you want that to continue?
[17:44:41] <biberu> that's hardly what "everyone" has been doing
[17:44:57] <remolej> this seems to be quite mature and stable product thats been around for at least 8 years  now
[17:45:13] <stenno> i like node much more than php, i don't really care what other peoples are using though
[17:45:46] <remolej> stenno so there goes the reason for your recommendation then hehe
[17:45:54] <stenno> my recommendation?
[17:45:56] <stenno> what
[17:46:06] <stenno> oh ok i see
[17:46:50] <stenno> yeah i would def. use javascript if i wanted to have the features above (which i want) instaead of using a framework for the same features for a different language
[17:47:29] <stenno> but discussing this is beyond the scope of this channel
[17:49:45] <remolej> biberu from my evert encounter with docker its not recommended to run multiple  processes per container and sure - its just a guideline but i see it being followed quite religiouslu. kubernetes is another story ofc

[17:53:23] <adhawkins> Hi all. Hope this is an appropriate place to ask. I'm trying to cross-compile php 7.4 on a relatively old platform. The compiler used is gcc v4.2.3. Can anyone tell me where the build requirements for php are listed?

[17:59:32] <stenno> me neither,  as mentioned above
[17:59:44] <remolej>  all im saying is - cheap coroutines, concurrency, and async is a thing now in php. Ive been looking at it all weekend and im salivating

[18:05:01] <AllenJB> See also: ReactPHP, which requires no extension and, shipped with PHP 8.1, Fibers.
[18:07:06] <Naktibalda> it is hardly news, Zend Framework blog was writing about swoole 3-4 years ago.
[18:07:50] <remolej> Naktibalda you know ive read about it on mwop blog long long time ago and plain ignored it as I failed to understand what it was

[18:10:40] <remolej> just my 2 cents, subjective personal opinion
[18:13:53] <noord> async, nonblocking, subroutine thing is overrated, the order should be like simple, correct, well documented and performant, nowadays hardware is enough to sync manner
[18:16:31] <remolej> noord no its not lol. no amount of cpu performance will help you if you have to make 20 database calls since its IO bound and not cpu bound my friend
[18:17:26] <noord> remolej: avoiding them is an still option
[18:18:52] <AllenJB> Also of note: Many extensions / libraries provide asynchronous methods without the need for swoole / reactphp / etc. mysqli and curl, for example.

[18:21:36] <noord> remolej: introducing fibers, subprocesses, light processes whatever you call, break the isolation between requests, you have to ensure your system remains good state after something go wrong
[18:22:04] <__adrian> ^ it's very, fundamentally, different than the traditional php model.
[18:22:25] <__adrian> not to say it's bad, but it's not something most people will/should ever need/use.

[22:04:19] <The_Blode_> Any probabilities
[22:04:35] <__adrian> no one will stop you
[22:05:11] <The_Blode_> Is there any other backend I could use...maybe in a PWA
[22:05:23] <__adrian> The_Blode_: it's not really realistic to build an android app "before xmas" _at all_ for a beginner
[22:05:33] <novns> The_Blode_, why do you need a backend on android?
[22:05:36] <__adrian> see Sammitch's suggestion: hire an app developer.
[22:05:55] <__adrian> or make it "next xmas" if you're willing to put the time in.
[22:06:17] <The_Blode_> How does it work when you hire people to code your app
[22:06:25] <The_Blode_> What happens to the source code / idea
[22:06:42] <__adrian> tl;dr: you should specify that (and other things) in the contract you sign
[22:07:05] <The_Blode_> Ok thanks adrian and novns
[22:07:47] <__adrian> np
[22:09:37] *** paule32_ is now known as paule32
[22:12:16] <Sammitch> so in the last 6 months we've had a heat dome, then a large swath of the province burst into flames, a couple weeks ago the "bomb cyclone", and now an "atmospheric river" putting a large swath of the province underwater
[22:12:22] <Sammitch> mt =_=;
[22:22:36] <The_Blode_> On second thoughts, I may take the plunge and learn Java.
[22:22:44] <The_Blode_> This app creation can be the motivation.
[22:27:48] <novns> The_Blode_, it's not java anymore, it's kotlin
