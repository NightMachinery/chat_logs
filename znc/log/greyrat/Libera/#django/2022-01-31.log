[12:53:34] <pycode1> the problem is that i have managed=False
[12:53:39] <pycode1> but i also would like to run an sql
[12:53:47] <pycode1> so i used RunSql in migration
[12:53:55] <pycode1> when i run manage.py migrate i see no migration to run
[12:54:11] <pycode1> so i suppose that managed=False does not run the migrations.RunSQL
[12:54:23] <apollo13> those two things are orthogonal
[12:54:30] <apollo13> sounds more likely your migration file is wrong

[12:55:06] <serafeim> i wanted to know how to configure connection poolign for pyodbc
[12:55:44] <apollo13> generally I'd say that depends on the backend you are using
[12:55:55] <serafeim> i'm using ms sql server
[12:56:12] <apollo13> so whatever ms sql server offers as connection pool?
[12:56:21] <pycode1> i get no error apollo13
[12:56:24] <serafeim> can't i configure this somehow ?
[12:56:37] <apollo13> serafeim: where? in django, that wouldn't make much sense
[12:56:58] <serafeim> and another one. i updated from django 3.2 to django 4.0. when i try to login with django i get a CSRF error. i didn't change anything else between the update.
[12:57:02] <apollo13> asume django is deployed over multiple machines and processes; the connection pool would have to be external there
[12:57:18] <serafeim> apollo13: hm yes... ok i understand
[12:57:28] <apollo13> serafeim: I think there was a change to CSRF that is backwards compatible but that should be documented in the release notes
[12:57:38] <apollo13> there is an interim setting that you can set to make it compatible
[12:57:53] <serafeim> ths one : CSRF protection now consults the Origin header, if present. To facilitate this, some changes to the CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS setting are required. ?
[12:58:07] <apollo13> (oh I ment incompatible in the first sentence)
[12:58:25] <apollo13> no that should work ootb, but adjusting your setting should certainly be done at some point in the future
[12:59:22] <apollo13> I was thinking of CSRF_COOKIE_MASKED -- but apparently that is 4.1
[12:59:23] <serafeim> it doesn't work though
[12:59:59] <apollo13> as I said, that change shouldn't be your problem
[13:00:11] <serafeim> i needed to set the CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS setting to wkr
[13:00:13] <apollo13> please make sure to save the currently rejected CSRF token so it can be reproduced later
[13:00:55] <apollo13> mhm I am not sure when exactly CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS was introduced, but it had backwards compat code for the old domain setting
[13:01:32] <apollo13> how did you configure CSRF before?
[13:01:46] <serafeim> i did not use that setting at all
[13:02:00] <apollo13> well that is for sure, but the "old" CSRF settings?
[13:02:07] <apollo13> TRUSTED_DOMAIN or what it was called
[13:02:30] <apollo13> that said with trusted_origins I don't think your csrf cookie is used at all
[13:02:45] <apollo13> so you might just have sidestepped the issue which is why I'd save the cookie and debug that

[13:13:06] <serafeim> i am not sure how to debug that
[13:13:17] <serafeim> also why mess with it if it's working now ?
[13:13:38] <apollo13> because your users will be affected depending on their browser?
[13:14:04] <apollo13> because you might have uncovered a bug and could help fixing it for others?
[13:14:53] *** Joins: Spr0cket (sprocket@user/Spr0cket)
[13:15:01] <serafeim> it's not easy for me to do that with our resources
[13:15:28] <apollo13> serafeim: well do you at least have the broken csrf token at hand? then I could eventually check myself
[13:15:45] <apollo13> and if it affects your website users you will have to put that time in anyways I fear
[13:16:02] <serafeim> yes if it ain't working i'll research it more but for now it seems to be ok
[13:16:32] <serafeim> and i have some java work for this pdf signinig project https://github.com/spapas/pdf-sign-check which is very difficult for me
[13:16:36] <apollo13> well yes for you and your browser
[13:17:03] <apollo13> the problem with CSRF is that every user has their own token, so just because it works for you is no indication it will work for others
[13:17:31] <serafeim> the good thing is that this is an internal app so i can request a particular browser from my users
[13:17:31] <apollo13> serafeim: funny you'd say that, I work in that area (digital signatures etc ;))
[13:18:17] <serafeim> we need this for my organization because our internal mail is all digitally signed
[13:18:29] <apollo13> there are plenty of ready tools to check a signature though, sure you wanna implement that on your own?
[13:18:40] <serafeim> apollo13: like?
[13:18:58] <apollo13> serafeim: depends, which signatures are we talking, eIDAS?
[13:19:06] <serafeim> apollo13: this project is working for years it's more or less complete. the checking./verifying part
[13:19:14] <apollo13> IC
[13:19:21] <serafeim> i'm implementing an "signing" part now
[13:19:32] <apollo13> mind a pm?
[13:19:33] <serafeim> use an organization cert and auto-sign your docs
[13:19:36] <serafeim> yes of course

[15:19:39] <pycode1> pardon, should i add queryset methods, like, get_latest_products() etc...in the manager instead of the model class basically those methods are referring to the current user that has some associated products
[15:20:01] <pycode1> but i wonder if i have to put such method inside the User model or the UserManager
[15:20:16] <serafeim> pycode1: i don't use queryset methods. i have observed they make my code harder to follow
[15:20:21] <apollo13> glitchtip is an old sentry fork, no?
[15:20:24] <serafeim> i just write the queries where they are needed
[15:20:45] <pycode1> serafeim, yes but if you see that you use that query in many places where do you put such query?
[15:20:47] <serafeim> apollo13: yes it was forked before sentry changed its license. it's open source and supported (and works fine)
[15:21:00] <pycode1> do you not use a "centralized" class to handle such commond queries ?
[15:21:00] <apollo13> sentry is also opensource ;)
[15:21:03] <pycode1> common
[15:21:06] <serafeim> apollo13: not anymore :)
[15:21:18] <serafeim> https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/LICENSE
[15:21:48] <serafeim> pycode1: it depends on the case. i usually create instance methods that would do what i need
[15:21:49] <apollo13> okay, not osi approved opensource; but afaik free for you to use
[15:22:00] <apollo13> as long as you don't sell sentry as a service
[15:22:08] <serafeim> apollo13: yes but i don't like using such solutions in our premises.
[15:22:19] <serafeim> apollo13: also self hosting sentry nowadays is more or less impossible
[15:22:24] <apollo13> *shrug* I honestly understand why they did it
[15:22:30] <serafeim> because it is a docker mess of dependencies
[15:22:46] <apollo13> well yes, it is the same codebase after all, sentry is massive nowadays
[15:22:50] <serafeim> if you want to self-host sentry you inhnerit all the cruft of the cloud sentry
[15:23:04] <serafeim> apollo13: correct. however i want to support 10 apps like 10 million apps
[15:23:19] <serafeim> sorry: i want to support 10 apps, *not* 10 million apps
[15:23:38] <apollo13> understood, but it is understandable that sentry doesn't want to maintain two sentry versions
[15:23:43] <serafeim> yes of course
[15:24:06] <apollo13> so if someone likes sentry and can host it, I'd still choose it over glitchtip probably
[15:24:20] <serafeim> also there's no reason for them since they want people to switch to cloud
[15:24:24] <serafeim> apollo13: yes but why  ?
[15:24:24] <pycode1> serafeim, ok
[15:24:34] <apollo13> serafeim: why what?
[15:24:42] <serafeim> apollo13: which use sentry over glitchtip ?
[15:24:52] <apollo13> better client compatibility and more features?
[15:25:00] <serafeim> glitchtip uses the sentry protocol so all your apps work as they are (you just change the dsn)
[15:25:16] <apollo13> sure but sentry does way more, doesn't it?
[15:25:16] <serafeim> also glitchtip is a *simple* django app. you can take a look at the code and understand everyything's happening
[15:25:24] <serafeim> i challenge you to do the same for sentry
[15:25:38] <apollo13> I can and I did ;)
[15:25:39] <serafeim> apollo13: yes definitely. but do you need that more ?
[15:25:51] <serafeim> apollo13: you can for the current vertion of sentry ?
[15:25:56] <serafeim> not the version from 5 years ago.
[15:26:27] <apollo13> I am not saying that I need more, I am just saying if someone needs/wants the sentry features and can afford to self-host it they are probably better off using sentry than hoping glitchtip would have all those features
[15:26:51] <apollo13> well it is a year or so ago when I had to fix some issues, but I give you that it is not straight forward as it was
[15:27:07] <serafeim> please take a look at the docker compose: https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/blob/master/docker-compose.yml
[15:27:26] <serafeim> do you even know what all this requirements are ?
[15:27:34] <serafeim> cause i don't nor i want to know
[15:27:51] <apollo13> I know them well enough to find my way around yes
[15:28:09] <apollo13> I am a system admin, it is my job to be able to work with such things
[15:28:13] <serafeim> kafka snuba clickhouse zookeper wtf ?
[15:28:31] <serafeim> apollo13: well i'm a programmer that because of lack of system admins does also admin jobs
[15:29:02] <apollo13> to be fair aside from snuba which is afaik sentry specific the rest are relatively well known tools
[15:29:21] <serafeim> maybe to people and companies using them
[15:29:37] <serafeim> i'm not familiar with any of these except clickhouse which i know is a time series db
[15:29:50] <apollo13> sure but isn't that the case for everything? if sentry where written in ruby you'd probably also have a hard time with the glitchtip fork
[15:30:07] <serafeim> yes definitely. i'm lucky it's in django :)
[15:30:27] <apollo13> I mean you could probably still host it easily but I for my life cannot figure out what ruby code does
[15:31:02] <serafeim> what i'm saying is that most sentry features are not useful to most installations. so why would you choose sentry (and inherit all these non-needed dependewncies) over glitchtip?
[15:32:20] <apollo13> Well if I had any say in it I would use the hosted version where possible anyways
[15:32:40] <hzm74> Hello, can somebody please help me with saving form-data to a database? I have setup a model (regular model, not modelform). Now i wanna save the data to my database.
[15:32:44] <apollo13> and sure glitchtip is fine, but if you want sentry features you don't have many options :)
[15:33:11] <hzm74> The data is data for 1 model and other foreignkey related models.

[15:33:52] <hzm74> I have trouble saving the data to the foreignkey related models.
[15:34:13] <serafeim> yes definitely if you need the sentry features you'll have to use it
[15:34:24] <hzm74> I get ValueError: Cannot assign "'1'": "Person.hometown" must be a "City" instance.
[15:34:25] <apollo13> hzm74: you just get the ids, so you will probably set province_id=province
[15:34:30] <apollo13> same for hometown
[15:34:50] <hzm74> apollo13, thnx. Gonna try it out.
[15:34:57] <serafeim> hzm74: also you need to use the form.cleaned_data to get the values, not get it directly from POST
[15:35:13] <apollo13> oh yeah that would also help :D
[15:35:21] <serafeim> ii.e `firstname=request.POST['first_name']` has to be firstname = form.cleaned_data.get('first_name')
[15:35:33] <hzm74> serafeim: thnx, gonna change that.
[15:40:43] <hzm74> serafeim, i changed it to personform.cleaned_data.get(´first_name´). But now i get error:

[16:08:36] <GinFuyou> .filter() doesn't return instance
[16:08:57] <GinFuyou> what that lookup was supposed to solve?
[16:10:33] <hzm74> Hello GinFuyou: was trying to solve saving form-data to a database. I´m using a regular form, not modelform.
[16:11:31] <hzm74> I get the values from the form-fields with a POST request. Then i´m trying to save these fields to the database.
[16:12:47] <GinFuyou> not sure why you are not using a model form looking at your models, but technically it doesn't matter, just more manual coding
[16:12:50] <hzm74> Problem is i get the id´s from foreignkey related models (used ModelChoiceField).
[16:13:41] <GinFuyou> pretty sure form converts it to instances

[16:26:08] <vancha112[m]> attaching to a post_save signal, but that failed because you can't get access to the user that initiated the request from within a signal.
[16:26:08] <vancha112[m]> Then i tried overriding the models save method which failed, because there isn't a way to access the initiating user from there either.
[16:26:08] <vancha112[m]> Is there any other way to get a user upon making changes to a model? :(
[16:26:40] <GinFuyou> hzm74, well, it's technically correct, but where is form part in there?

[17:39:44] <vancha112[m]> actually no, this would break if multiple formsets have changes :)
[17:39:55] <GinFuyou> What do you mean about the code?
[17:41:32] <vancha112[m]> https://pastebin.com/gs9tdf1H
[17:42:13] <vancha112[m]> so i loop over the forms in the formset, check for changes, and for any form with changes, i compare the previous value with the new value
[17:43:22] <vancha112[m]> if it was false and is now true, the foreign key of the user that made this change is saved as a property of the model that is being changed
[17:44:10] <vancha112[m]> I do think this is the way to go though ^^
[17:46:26] <GinFuyou> mmm, not sure why it would break on multiple formsets changing yet...
[17:47:40] <vancha112[m]> # old_value = Malfunction.objects.filter(id=changed_malfunctions.id)[0].is_solved
[17:48:08] <vancha112[m]> if i created a new object through that set, it tries to find an old value that doesn't exist, and would crash with a list index out of range exception right there
[17:48:38] <vancha112[m]> so i still need a better way of finding out if the form change is an update or a creation
[17:49:20] <GinFuyou> can't you safely assume that non-existing objects means creation?
[17:49:21] <vancha112[m]> I guess I could just count the queryset ^^ no results means no object exists
[17:49:55] <GinFuyou> also .first() doesn't throw exception on non-existing object unlike .get() iirc
[17:49:58] <vancha112[m]> yes, but in my case i don't want to assign a user upon creation, only upon updates :)
[17:50:16] <vancha112[m]> interesting :o
[17:50:33] <vancha112[m]> I'll try counting first, i guess that's the easiest to implement for me :)
[17:50:41] <GinFuyou> since same formset can be used for creating and updating I'm not sure there is a fundamentally better way
[17:50:58] <GinFuyou> well creating == object.pk is None
[17:51:09] <vancha112[m]> No worries ^^ I've been fighting this thing for days, i couldn't figure it out :)

[19:28:48] <pycode1> i have to render a chart in my page this chart is very big it has around 100k points, i can see it correctly there are no big problem BUT...I noticed that if i return the list of points with a queryset then i need to loop over this giant list to create the chart. is there a "native" way to transform the giant list into a json to directly pass the point to javascripts?

[19:32:07] <pycode1> try to exlain it a bit better... basically i have many points inside the database i need to get those points and put them inside a template to let javascript render the chart
[19:32:50] <pycode1> the query is not a problem because it is very fast, so i am asking how can i get all of those points and put them in the template in a manner that javascript can use it without doing anything special

[19:58:22] <vlt> pycode1: Who is "I" here? The view? The template? JS in the browser?
[19:58:22] <pycode1> vlt, yes because i have a queryset i need to "write" those points in the .html

[19:59:34] <pycode1> what i am asking is how can i convert the queryset into json to let javascript read those points without slow down the entire process
[19:59:34] <vlt> pycode1: If you put json.dumps(list_of_points) in the view you have available in the template as JSON object.
[20:00:02] <pycode1> vlt, in my case list_pf_points is a queryset that i run with .all()
[20:00:07] <pycode1> each row as a point
[20:01:48] <vlt> pycode1: You could try if that works and if needed adapt maybe the query .values() and then ask again with a specific question ;-)
