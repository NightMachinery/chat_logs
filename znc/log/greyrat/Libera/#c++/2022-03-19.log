[08:53:09] <Gamah> i don't understand the semantics of vector::clear vs list::clear docs say to use swap to force reallocation? so like have an empty vector of the same type somewhere else to sawp?
[08:56:48] <RandomReader> (which docs say to swap?)
[08:58:36] <RandomReader> but you could also use .shrink_to_fit()
[08:59:11] <Gamah> it's still seg faulting with shrink_to_fit
[08:59:15] <RandomReader> I'm assuming that what you want is for the vector to stop using space here, otherwise I'm not clear on the question
[08:59:27] <Gamah> these docs https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/clear/
[08:59:36] <RandomReader> seg faulting would be an entirely different problem, and not at all about whatever you're currently looking at

[09:12:13] <Alipha> Gamah: as hachikuji[m] said, use a for loop and use indexes instead of iterators
[09:12:39] <RandomReader> how does this logically work anyway, if you're continuously adding to the vector you're looking at? (how do you know when you're done?)
[09:12:41] <Gamah> the iteration occasionally needs to add more elements..

[09:20:04] <Gamah> interesting....

[09:20:50] <RandomReader> as for *why*, it goes to what hachikuji[m] is mentioning: a vector models an array, a contiguous chunk of memory .. so if it needs to change size (typically grow), that usually means getting an entirely different chunk of memory and moving all the elements to it
[09:21:08] <RandomReader> which means all the things that describe the previous element locations are invalid

[09:23:14] <RandomReader> the advantage to vector, and why it's recommended so often, is in locality: elements are next to each other, and with the way most modern computers work with memory caching, that means faster for operations that are working on several elements or iterating over them
[09:23:25] <Gamah> that makes sense.... i guess i could just declare the vector of some large size that would never matter...?
[09:23:31] <RandomReader> the tradeoff is that growing/shrinking the vector is slower

[09:23:57] <RandomReader> well no, because then it wouldn't be useful as a container, since you'd always have the same number of elements in it and would need to keep track of which ones you don't care about

[09:29:42] <RandomReader> you can also just store a variable for the end, "auto original_size = vec.size();" and use that in the for-loop if you don't want to check the newly added ones
[09:30:09] <Gamah> gprof says ~66% has to do with the random engine and shuffling stuff
[09:30:25] <Gamah> the next biggest is one of the vector push_back()'s at 5%... so i think i'm good
[09:30:52] <Gamah> it would be nice to have some faster random stuff
[09:30:55] <RandomReader> is the shuffling happening on this container?
[09:30:59] <Gamah> no
[09:31:07] <Gamah> and it won't be accessed during shuffling
[09:31:16] <RandomReader> ok, then yeah, this doesn't seem worth worrying about
[09:31:45] <hachikuji[m]> now that you told us what you're doing, using anything but a vector would be completely wrong
[09:31:46] <Gamah> i'm not positive i'm using mt19937 correctly... i've seen stuff saying it
[09:31:55] <Gamah> it can be slow if not seeded with enough data?
[09:32:06] <RandomReader> no, the seed only matters for creating it
[09:32:09] <Gamah> but the code is fast enough now that i've not gone down that rabit hole yet, sounds like an easy win for later
[09:32:25] <RandomReader> you do want to create and store everything at the beginning, and then just repeatedly call the distribution() to get a random number
[09:32:41] <RandomReader> sometimes I see people put the creation of the engine in a loop, which is not what you want
[09:32:52] <Gamah> hachikuji[m]: i feel like i haven't given you enough context, the shuffling/random stuff has nothing to do with the container in question
[09:33:18] <RandomReader> but there are a lot of algorithms out there and some are faster than MT these days
[09:33:30] <hachikuji[m]> if you're shuffling elements then anything without random access will be slow
[09:33:36] <Gamah> RandomReader: afaik std::shuffle() does this (not random_shuffle())
[09:34:01] <Gamah> hachikuji[m]: correct, the thing being shuffled is a vector
[09:34:15] <MsPoop> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3SnEkktIxE
[09:34:48] <Gamah> MsPoop: beatsaber is so fun... i think i will play some later now
[09:35:02] <MsPoop> hot
[09:35:22] <hachikuji[m]> in any case, mersenne twister isn't the best algorithm, if it's a bottleneck maybe look for a better one
[09:35:28] <Gamah> RandomReader: anything that's faster than MT that i can drop in place as an engine in c++ to use shuffle()?
[09:35:41] <Gamah> hachikuji[m]: open to suggestions
[09:35:49] <RandomReader> oh gotcha, then nevermind the distribution, but you still want to create the generator (and seed it) ahead of time, and just reuse it when you call shuffle
[09:36:02] <RandomReader> (if you're not already, I mention it because it's a common mistake)
[09:36:23] <Gamah> i'm doing that for sure
[09:36:25] <Gamah> one per thread
[09:36:36] <Gamah> passing the engine into the call to the thread
[09:37:14] <hachikuji[m]> it depends on your needs, my favourite is https://prng.di.unimi.it/
[09:37:19] <RandomReader> you might try LCG .. beyond that, it might be case of looking at external libraries
[09:37:44] <Gamah> RandomReader:  https://github.com/Gamah/bjsim-cpp/blob/master/bjsim.cpp#L339-L342
[09:38:11] <RandomReader> or, actually, std::random_device would be worth a shot .. it's going to be inconsistent on different platforms, but might be great on yours
[09:38:35] <RandomReader> unless you need a stable seed (reproducible sequence), in which case it's useless
[09:38:58] <Gamah> std::random device couldn't be used as a source for std::shuffle last i recall... and i also remember googling resulting in saying MT was > lcg?
[09:39:14] <Gamah> a stable seed would be nice.... but not required. i can fall back to something slower for debugging

[09:40:55] <Gamah> hachikuji[m]: i think i decided i would try this one eventually when i felt like also implementing the shuffle... having MT and std::shuffle built in was easy and already faster than most other softwares that attempt this problem
[09:41:04] <Alipha> Gamah: you could use std::deque instead of std::vector. std::deque is random access and push_back doesn't invalidate iterators
[09:42:03] <Gamah> how would a deque compare to a list? googling
[09:42:18] <hachikuji[m]> it would be pretty close
[09:42:49] <Alipha> Compare how? deque has similar performance to vector
[09:42:57] <hachikuji[m]> Gamah: you use random device only for generating a seed, they're way too slow for actually doing anything
[09:44:03] <hachikuji[m]> unless the thing you're doing is benefitting from it, e.g. cryptography

[09:46:00] <Alipha> I'd probably use std::vector and reserve(4) then.

[20:24:59] <joomla9> The `initializer list` syntax is the same when doing inheritance or when creating a constructor. If the class i'm inheriting has the same name as my member variable, would `::` be the correct way of initializing the inherited constructor? here is an example to clear the question: https://wandbox.org/permlink/37k9OZD714a7iziP

[20:27:49] <anyone> you just need to specify the exact namespace

[20:38:03] <IceMichael> stupid question, I need a std::function to store a copy of a lambda that returns a pointer to A
[20:38:05] <IceMichael> is this std::function<A*()>?
[20:38:07] <IceMichael> it seems like I currently get a pointer to a lambda stored, maybe I am wrong
