[11:40:31] <betabug> good morning! for anybody who wondered about my problem a few days ago (disappearing mails with the "junk" option in `action "local_mail"` ...
[11:40:44] <betabug> turns out my mistake was quite simple
[11:41:05] <betabug> Maildir folders are created as dotfiles
[11:41:19] <betabug> so I simply didn't see the dir in the shell, neither in mutt
[11:41:45] <betabug> no idea why I didn't see it from the phone imap client, but anyway, all resolved now
[12:07:03] <Naglfar> betabug, there are other folders in ~/Maildir/ are also created as dotfiles as: .Drafts or .Sent
