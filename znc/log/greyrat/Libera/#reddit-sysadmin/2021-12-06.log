[14:37:09] <A-KO> I should have done this a while ago
[14:37:33] <macinsight> But we're *finally* in the process of moving away from non-RFC adress space, which is such a big undertaking, I don't wanna touch anything until we got that done.

[14:38:23] <macinsight> A-KO: Want some /r/reddit-sysadmin x /r/nosleep?
[14:38:32] <A-KO> why would you move away from publicly addressable space?
[14:38:38] <A-KO> I mean, unless you're running out of addresses
[14:38:40] <A-KO> then just move to v6?
[14:38:41] <A-KO> lol
[14:38:53] <macinsight> 'cause all our net is internal, and the public stuff is not ours. It's a wide range of canadian stuff.
[14:38:58] <A-KO> oh
[14:38:59] <A-KO> wait
[14:39:05] <A-KO> so they used space that they didn't own?
[14:39:09] <macinsight> And v6 isn't supported by everything. Or much of anything, tbh.
[14:39:33] <macinsight> Yup. 198.168.x.x/24. Over a dozen nets there.
[14:39:49] <A-KO> when it comes to IP addresses there's really no actual concept of 'internal' versus 'external'. Only 'reserved' and 'okay to advertise to the internet.'
[14:39:57] <macinsight> s/tbh./ At least not ehre.
[14:39:58] <layer8> macinsight meant: "And v6 isn't supported by everything. Or much of anything,  At least not ehre."
[14:40:08] <A-KO> that's a pretty important technical difference IMO :P
[14:40:20] <macinsight> Yeah, but this network is 40 years old.

[14:41:43] <Hunterkll> :P
[14:42:25] <A-KO> anyways. Very important. There's no concept of 'internal'. Only "should this be routed over the internet or not?"--and the answer by RFC is no, but there's no technical reason it can't be (although many upstream providers filter it, of course)
[14:42:29] <macinsight> A-KO: If your space is your own, sure. If it ain't, and you route shit... We run critical infra, so packets intended for german major-city traffic light control ending up at some canadian bank, and vice-versa, is... undesired.
[14:42:45] <A-KO> well yeah, sure. But sounds like maybe they had that space at some point?
[14:43:08] <macinsight> A-KO: No. We never did.
[14:44:08] <macinsight> A-KO: This network has been in existence since the early 90s, late 80s. We never had the space, and the company that set it up has zero knowledge of IT. ZERO. NADA. NULL. NONE.

[18:45:04] <csws> when I did rental cheques in canada I wrote 12 months worth and gave them to the landlord
[18:45:08] <csws> wanted to do EFT but nooo
[18:45:26] <csws> said some bullshit about cheques clearing faster. meanwhile they'd piss around depositing them
[18:45:36] <csws> like depositing them 3 weeks late
[18:45:40] <sd> 08<tâ€‹herottenapple> that's what I was wondering
[18:45:42] <sd> 11<Hâ€‹otmess> they might well do given america
[18:45:50] <sd> 11<Hâ€‹otmess> chequs clear in what 2 days
[18:45:51] <sd> 08<tâ€‹herottenapple> or if they say oh we dont have your check
[18:45:57] <sd> 08<tâ€‹herottenapple> and charge you a late fee
[18:46:06] <csws> the bank provided a photo of the back of the cheque so you could see when they were depositing them
[18:46:08] <sd> 11<Hâ€‹otmess> bank transfers can take 3 days in america
[18:46:09] <csws> and yeah 1-2 days was normal
[18:46:25] <sd> 11<Hâ€‹otmess> cheqes are more regulated i belive in america
[18:46:31] <sd> 11<Hâ€‹otmess> uk lit a fire under our banks
[18:46:34] <csws> you could even deposit them using a phone app
[18:46:39] <sd> 11<Hâ€‹otmess> told em to clear the shit in 2min maximum
[18:46:40] <csws> take a pic, sign the back and it'd "just work"
[18:46:54] <int0x1C8> I just have my credit union send a check by mail
[18:47:18] <csws> in aus you can do up to $1k instantaneously
[18:47:34] <sd> 11<Hâ€‹otmess> i dont think there is a limit in uk
[18:47:41] <sd> 11<Hâ€‹otmess> you hit a hold though
[18:47:41] <csws> there's two separate systems here
[18:48:06] <csws> "osko" which is instant but has a limit
[18:48:25] <csws> then the usual EFT which doesn't really have a limit but it'll only clear in business hours and in batches
[18:48:26] <rpifan> lucky in europe its all bank transfer
[18:48:27] <rpifan> and its free
[18:48:33] <csws> so if you send one at 8am it'll take until 9am to clear as that's when they run a batch
[18:48:48] <csws> I think they do 4 batches
[18:48:58] <csws> like 9am, 12pm, 3pm, 6pm

Reminds me of a time at an MSP, beginning of the year when projects start, project manager calls up a client whose main point of contact happens to be a very attractive lady, and without thinking starts the call up with "Hey soandso, it's $projectmanager! So, It's been a while since I've seen your rack!" then realizes what he just said and corrects repeatedly with "SERVER RACK! SERVER RACK!"

[23:53:56] <sd> 05<Bâ€‹ardRT> I'd ask why you didn't grab your caulk gun and turn THAT thing into a fish tank but I suppose it would annoy the fish, having to swim between the pixels.
