[07:29:19] <pnbeast> Baphomet, in general, replacing a spinning drive with SSD will make your computer seem faster.  For a specific task like web browsing, which involves communication over a very flaky network - maybe not so much.

[10:41:20] <alkisg> My turn to ask! I'm on Ubuntu 22.04; I think since Ubuntu 18.04, select + middle mouse button click started copying the previous selection. Then, without re-selecting anything, a second mouse click copies the newest selection. It's like there's a "delay to copy"; is there a xorg setting for such a delay?
[10:41:55] <Affliction> I think that depends on the program?
[10:42:27] <alkisg> No middle mouse click paste is a xorg thing, I don't think it's specific to programs or toolkits

[16:57:53] <labrador> Dr_Coke, oh ok sure...
[16:58:05] <ananke> fuzzybear3965: you clearly are not reading anything, and just throwing random things at a wall. over 100 does not matter, because the range is from 0 to 100
[16:58:14] <ananke> labrador: I'm sure there is
[16:58:19] <Dr_Coke> labrador maybe that's just conspiracy

[16:58:53] <Dr_Coke> Need to upgrade the cpu next motherboard and ram
[16:58:56] <crandon> Hi! I'm trying online (re)encryption with cryptsetup on ubuntu 20.04 on a GCP instance, but I fail either using a virtual disk (seen as sdb1) or with an image file via loopback. The error in either case is: "This operation is not supported for this device type." I've shrinked the ext4 filesystem in both cases and there's for sure space for the luks headers. Interestingly offline reencryption with cryptsetup-reencrypt is working
[16:58:56] <crandon> fine, but cryptsetup reencrypt  --encrypt  --init-only --reduce-device-size 32M /dev/sdb1 root_encrypted produces the above error
[16:59:01] <Tucupitano> Just put an eye on Ukraine
[16:59:03] <fuzzybear3965> ananke you're clearly not aware of the system limits because the range is 0 to 200.
[16:59:05] <Dr_Coke> a superfast ssd would be nice too
[16:59:21] <fuzzybear3965> Also, I can start reading your link _and_ perform another build at the same time.

[16:59:41] <ananke> fuzzybear3965: that appears to be a recent change, but '12000' is still a ridiculous value

[17:00:38] <Tucupitano> fuzzy, you could check dmesg
[17:00:43] <fuzzybear3965> Reading an article about kernel memory management is generally good pedagogy but probably not answer my question.

[17:02:01] <fuzzybear3965> I understand that an application build will trash the SSD because pages will always be swapped out.

The error in either case is: "This operation is not supported for this device type." I've shrinked the ext4 filesystem in both cases and there's for sure space for the luks headers. Interestingly offline reencryption with cryptsetup-reencrypt is working
[17:17:33] <crandon> fine, but cryptsetup reencrypt  --encrypt  --init-only --reduce-device-size 32M /dev/sdb1 root_encrypted produces the above error

[21:36:55] <azizLIGHT> Whats wrong with having apostrophes or quotes in file names
[21:37:08] <jensen> in vim, dash delimits words by dashes, but not by underscores. Though in filenames, underscores tend to replace spaces (moreso than dashes) and therefore delimits words in most cases, so that seems to be the only unfortunate inconsistency. but not a big deal, readability is more important
[21:37:14] <Tucupitano> It can create ambiguity
[21:37:24] <jensen> it's easier for tab completion and less escaping
