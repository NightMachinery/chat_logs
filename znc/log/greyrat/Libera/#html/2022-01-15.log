[03:35:19] <johnjaye> hrm. is it bad if the href tags in these html files are like /folder1/folder?
[03:35:42] <johnjaye> i thought for the href param to work it had to start with the local relative path, not a /
[03:38:36] <johnjaye> very puzzling, all the html files in this github folder start with a / so you can't use the table of contents at al
[03:50:31] <nbjoerg> johnjaye: depends on how they are deployed?
[03:50:53] <nbjoerg> there are valid reasons for both variants, using relative paths and using absolute paths
[03:50:59] <johnjaye> idk maybe. i thought to file an issue on the github page
[03:51:07] <johnjaye> because they clearly look like relative links. just with an extra / in front
[03:51:27] <nbjoerg> that's by definition not a relative link :)
[03:52:45] <johnjaye> the folder is like 20.07/index.html and then 20.07/chapter1 20.07/chapter2, etc
[03:53:04] <johnjaye> nbjoerg: yes but the pages also have "prev" and "next" links which are clearly intended to be links to the next document
[03:53:21] <johnjaye> so unless im missing something obvious i think it's a bug
[03:54:26] <lilmonkey> nbjoerg, if it doesn't start with a scheme and `:`, it's relative
[03:54:38] <lilmonkey> Don't confuse URLs with filesystem paths
[03:55:34] <lilmonkey> If it starts with a single `/`, it's root-relative. If it starts with `//`, it's scheme-relative.
[03:55:39] <nbjoerg> sure
[03:55:52] <nbjoerg> not really useful distinction in this context
[03:56:04] <lilmonkey> "nbjoerg> that's by definition not a relative link :"
[03:56:18] <lilmonkey> Then that isn't either.
[03:56:34] <nbjoerg> ok, fine. I just don't care enough to continue this discussion
[03:56:38] <lilmonkey> And surely correcting misinformation is always appropriate.
[04:02:22] <nbjoerg> lilmonkey: at least in the context of HTML, it is pretty much sophistry as most link use is path based and absolute URLs are by far the exception.
[04:05:05] <lilmonkey> You'd be wrong. Absolute URLs are plenty common.
[04:06:11] <nbjoerg> for external content, yes. to reference "local" resources: no
[04:06:46] <lilmonkey> Again, wrong. If you worked on (large) real-world projects you'd know that.
[04:06:53] <lilmonkey> And regardless, that doesn't make the distinction less important to understand.
[04:08:47] <lilmonkey> I love how defensive you got after being corrected. First it's important enough to you to specifically point out how it's absolute, and when corrected it's suddenly not important anymore. Please, just take the L with some dignity.
[04:09:00] <lilmonkey> Dear lord
[04:11:49] <nbjoerg> *sigh*
[04:17:20] <nbjoerg> johnjaye: so to go back to the original issue. long standing back practise would be to use a relative path within related documents. absolute path is fine too when they are generated, but not recommented for hand-written html (more error prone)
[04:17:58] <nbjoerg> johnjaye: absolute urls are generally discouraged for internal use as it is redundant (more traffic) and generally asking for maintainance trouble down the road
[04:18:41] <lilmonkey> wait what
[04:18:45] <lilmonkey> more traffic?
[04:18:55] <lilmonkey> Oh this is gonna get good
[04:19:01] <nbjoerg> johnjaye: you will find some misguided recommendations suggesting the use absolute urls to get canonical urls for all documents, e.g. when you have www.example.com/foo/bar and example.com/foo/bar references the same content, so always use https://www.example.com/foo/bar
[04:19:03] <lilmonkey> Please do elaborate
[04:19:24] <nbjoerg> johnjaye: but the correct way for dealing with that is to redirect example.com to www.example.com
[04:20:28] <nbjoerg> johnjaye: at least historically absolute urls often turned into a massive issue during the http->https migration as they resulted in mixed content errors etc
[04:22:40] <nbjoerg> johnjaye: most of the advice you will hit on the hit is based on very misguided SEO tips based on broken tools and misunderstanding of how any reasonable spider works
[04:26:32] <johnjaye> ah i didn't know about the http->https migration
[04:27:57] <johnjaye> if the url starts with a / does that mean it starts from the system root as in the root file system?
[04:27:59] <nbjoerg> problem in that case is that e.g. reference an image using http from a document loaded via https might not get loaded or at least get a warning
[04:28:01] <johnjaye> that's what i would expect
[04:28:35] <nbjoerg> assuming you are serving the files via a bog standard server config: they are interpreted relative to the htdocs or so
[04:29:04] <nbjoerg> e.g. /srv/www/htdocs/foo/bar is accesed for /foo/bar as path component of the url
[04:29:37] <nbjoerg> you can't break out of the configured root directory (/srv/www/htdocs here) with .. unless your server has a major security issue :)
[04:30:13] <nbjoerg> this used to be a popular security issue for PHP scripts and a couple of other things
[04:34:20] <johnjaye> oh ok
[04:35:48] <nbjoerg> ultimately, absolute path or relative path both have their use cases and work better in different cases
