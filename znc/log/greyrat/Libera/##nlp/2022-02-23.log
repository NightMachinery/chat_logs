[15:05:09] <andrewzhurov> hey folks! I'm starting to dabble with NLP, want to extract original semantics expressed (with a loss) via text (or speech, if there are tools for that).
[15:05:10] <andrewzhurov> E.g. coreference resolution, NER etc.
[15:05:10] <andrewzhurov> Perhaps you would recommend tools for that?
[15:07:12] <andrewzhurov> I think on using it for extracting semantics out of a corpus of text
[15:09:49] <andrewzhurov> where corpus of text captures reasoning and restored semantics would allow to query/search/learn on _semantics_ rather than their textual syntactic representation
