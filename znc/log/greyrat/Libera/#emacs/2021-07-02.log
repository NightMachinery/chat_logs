[01:25:19] <lisp123> Just submitted my first package to MELPA - are they strict on accepting packages? Mine is just a set of useful keybindings
[01:25:33] <wasamasa> lol
[01:25:41] <wasamasa> why would that even be a package
[01:26:01] <lisp123> Cause they are really good :) Its for math, all the symbols
[01:26:11] <wasamasa> I see
[01:26:22] <wasamasa> yes, they are strict
[01:26:26] <lisp123> lol but they might not allow me :(
[01:26:43] <wasamasa> what's the deal with helm-mypackage

[01:27:46] <lisp123> Well its for entering math :)
[01:27:51] <wasamasa> usually I make fun of emacs-devel objecting to s.el and dash.el prefixes, but this, well...
[01:28:06] <lisp123> Did you see a reference to helm=package in my code? I thought I removed the example code lol
[01:28:09] <Walex_> lisp123: is is on some kind of gitlab/github?

[01:29:16] <Walex_> lisp123: 'kbdmathsym.el' perhaps?
[01:29:18] <wasamasa> for the record, if your command does the same thing as the printed key, you can simply use a keyboard macro (string or vector)
[01:29:50] <lisp123> If you look, hopefully you will agree the choice of keybindings is not bad at all ;) e.g. a for alpha, b for beta, etc
[01:30:02] <wasamasa> so instead of (lambda () (interactive) (insert "∀")) just "∀"
[01:30:20] <wasamasa> that should work, provided that macro tests with `commandp'
[01:30:25] <lisp123> wasamasa: thanks for the tip
[01:30:45] <lisp123> Walex_: math-mode sounds cool though :)
[01:30:50] <wasamasa> an even wilder tip: could it be that this would be better off as an emacs input method?

[01:32:56] <lisp123> wasamasa: let me google that

[05:06:48] <Walex_> didi: s-expressions were found to be so useful that IIRC noboby bothered to implement LISP2; the closest thing I found to it was the language of the Reduce algebra system.
[05:07:35] <didi> Walex_: Yeah, a lisp without s-expressions doesn't look appealing to me, but I OK in being surprised.
[05:07:42] <Walex_> didi: I will look at Racket, but my usual claim is that Python is LISP2 :-)

[05:09:17] <Walex_> in 1965-1970 (before my time) there were a lot of proposals for a successor to ALGOL 60, among them SIMULA 67, ALGOL-W, LISP2, ALGOL68.
[05:10:44] <Walex_> ALGOL-W was IIRC N Wirth's proposal and was *boring*. SIMULA 67 was the most interesting, ALGOL 68 was eventually the winner, and LISP2 did not get implemented.

[12:12:33] <Lulu> You can probably find some people's example .Xresources files on the web.
[12:13:10] <Lulu> danrobi70: Set `async-shell-command-display-buffer' to nil, obviously. :-)

[12:15:51] <Lulu> Just a nitpick: .Xdefaults is the one that is read whenever an X program is launched and it's deprecated in favour of .Xresources, which gets compiled into the XRM database (manually), which is then read by the X program.

[13:19:59] <lisp123> Quick Question - is there a way to call an emacs function on any key pressed (i.e. having a minor mode which does some checks everytime a new letter is added or removed)
[13:20:10] <lisp123> or is it done via defining keymaps for every key?
[13:21:22] *** Joins: lisp123_ (~lisp123@45.130.83.200)
[13:21:46] <ngz> lisp123: you can use `post-command-hook' and check `last-command' variable.

[13:23:46] <ngz> lisp123_: But, depending on your needs (i.e., call the function only when the buffer changed), you may use `before-change-functions' or `after-change-functions'.
[13:24:03] <ngz> `post-command-hook' is more generic.
[13:24:08] <lisp123_> ngz: thanks, let me try both
[13:24:24] <lisp123_> i want to keep speed fast, so will try something that minimises overhead

[13:25:02] <danrobi70> Lulu: best ive came with is with (call-process-shell-command "app here" nil 0). It does work theres no async-shell buffer. But big bummer the app does not show up in the buffer list.

[22:23:11] <bpalmer> wgreenhouse: the thing about copyright infringement and strict liability seems complicated, insofar as two people who have identical works independently produced may hold independent copyright on it.
[22:24:11] <wgreenhouse> bpalmer: sure, that affirmative defense exists post-Copilot as it did before it
[22:24:39] <xheimlich> there's this short story by Borges, "Pierre Menard, author of the Quixote".
[22:24:53] <bpalmer> wgreenhouse: one can imagine, for example, an automaton that produces every possible sentence that fits a given grammar, mechanically; as the work of a machine/process, there is no creativity in this. However, an artist can select from this output a single sentence that they feel is meaningful (meeting baseline creativity requirements) and publish it.
[22:25:08] <xheimlich> Basically Pierre Menard is setting out to write the Quixote independently but exactly.
[22:25:25] <grym> bpalmer: we don't have to imagine that
[22:25:25] <bpalmer> wgreenhouse: two such artists, selecting the same sentence, each would (I think) be eligible for copyright protection.
[22:25:27] <xheimlich> the whole GPT / AI Dungeon/ Copilot etc. has much of that.

[22:26:00] <xheimlich> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Menard,_Author_of_the_Quixote
[22:26:26] <bpalmer> So, now the question is how much closer copilot is to such a mechanical automaton than it is to a search engine that delivers up pre-written work.
[22:26:39] <grym> at $work we have to care about this sort of thing a lot: we train neural networks on client data. What, if any, complications the proprietary-ness of client data has on our ability to reuse network weights is, to date, something we have not gotten a clear answer on from our legal counsel

[22:28:39] <bpalmer> Aye.

[23:10:38] <xheimlich> both me and his mom are old-ish. I've been fretting about being in physical shape during his childhood and thinking of posting to reddit beginnerfitness or something.

[23:11:16] <grym> the cult word you want to attend to is "steady state"
[23:11:34] <xheimlich> like my back muscles are keeping up, and wonderfully I've been able to avoid misusing my lower back (his mom less so).

[23:12:02] <xheimlich> so I know it's heavier because ugh there are the strings that hold my back together again.
[23:12:32] <grym> do not underestimate the power of core strength
[23:12:40] <xheimlich> it goes away so I have to assume it's getting stronger. But my aerobic fitness has been deplorable for a decade.
[23:12:41] <grym> and/or regular-ish visits to a body worker
[23:12:54] <xheimlich> at one point (before the baby) I was doing calisthenics in the morning.

[23:13:45] <xheimlich> Basically exercises on the ground without equipment. I can do stuff with my legs and belly; it's stronger than the paunch suggests. 
[23:14:04] <grym> for kid-hauling, lats and obliques
[23:14:09] <xheimlich> but: it's not a lot, I'm still a lifelong sitdown nerd since childhood and did I mention I'm growing old?
[23:14:14] <grym> and don't forget your neck
[23:14:39] <xheimlich> grym: hauling is easy, picking up is the thing. I can avoid using my lower back doing whatever instinctively, mom can't.

[23:15:17] <grym> "lift from your diaphragm/abs"
[23:15:31] <xheimlich> yeah. that's what I do. So far.
[23:15:49] <xheimlich> breathe in like an opera singer.
[23:16:06] <grym> yeah.  if you have the means, time with a trainer is time well spent 
[23:16:16] <xheimlich> (my dad was a choral director for his whole life, there's this whole singing breathing thing one can learn)
[23:16:30] <grym> and exercise helps with postpartum malaise, which i assure you is a dad thing too

[23:28:01] <ro7> it could mean to define a variable, or it could be some kind of event, for all i know
[23:28:04] <bpalmer> ro7: by convention, functions that end in -p  are "predicates" , meaning they are used to answer true/false questions
[23:28:19] <bpalmer> in this case, youtube-url-p means "is this a youtube url?" , presumably
[23:28:19] <aidalgol> bpalmer: Hey, I was gonna answer that and take all the glory! :P
[23:29:02] <bpalmer> ro7: in this case, the simplest possible answer is to write a function that does a regular expression check on the url
[23:29:33] <bpalmer> (defun youtube-url-p (url) (string-match "^https://www.youtube.com/" url)) or something like that

[23:43:32] <bpalmer> xheimlich: hmm. In a way, I suppose.
[23:44:21] <bpalmer> xheimlich: it's similar to scheme's convention of using ! at the end of functions that mutate stuff.
[23:44:43] <bpalmer> or, for that matter, scheme's convention of using ? at the end of functions for predicates
[23:45:48] <bpalmer> I'm not sure if you use ? for other question functions: (define (who-goes-there?) (list 'tis 'i)) ?
[23:45:49] <xheimlich> bpalmer: I know, I know. It's what Common Lisp does.
