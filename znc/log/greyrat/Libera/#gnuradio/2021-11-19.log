[00:32:08] <matt_mills[m]> so I built a 18" cube faraday cage w/ aluminum mesh for window screens, but it doesn't seem to be very effective at decreasing external signals, only drops things 5-15 dB

[00:33:30] <matt_mills[m]> is there some magic I'm missing or do they just not do as much as I thought?

[00:41:19] <Yamakaja[m]> matt_mills: Here some reference examples, the lower-end materials are in the ~20 dB range, so i guess with your 5-15 dB that could be a realistic result https://aaronia.com/shielding-materials/
[00:41:36] <Yamakaja[m]> Especially with lower frequencies shielding gets harder

[00:51:34] <willcode4[m]> The little antennas that come with things often just look like antennas. If all the parts are in the container, then the USB cable could be re-radiating. Or the mesh may have a coating. You might have to solder every wire down something to make that work.
[00:53:57] <willcode4[m]> I wonder if the mesh strands actually act as a bunch of little antennas, even with grounding, when all put together.

[01:08:41] <matt_mills[m]> I'm looking at 56 Mhz to 1.9 Ghz
[01:08:42] <patchvonbraun[m]> Lower frequency situations a steel mesh is better.
[01:08:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> Also if the TX is in the near field the faraday cage wonâ€™t be as effective.

[01:40:22] <patchvonbraun[m]> matt_mills: Is the screen painted?  It may be that the conductivity at the joints isn't that good, I know that some aluminum window screen is black, and thus painted or anodized, leading to higher resistance at the joints.
[01:41:18] <matt_mills[m]> not painted, it's window screen material, the mesh is "solid" but kind of unweaves itself if you pull on the strands
[01:41:50] <matt_mills[m]> I mean I checked resistance by sticking ground on 1 side and measuring to each other side and it was all < 1 ohm ish

[01:43:14] <matt_mills[m]> yeah I figured but thought I'd mention

[01:44:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> The mechanism for a faraday cage is somewhat complex.  It acts basically as a very large impedance mis-match, and "reflects" incident waves, but those waves are actually from absorption and re-emission, from what I've learned over the years.
[01:45:25] <patchvonbraun[m]> You might go find yourself a scrap microwave oven to make comparisons with.
[01:46:59] <matt_mills[m]> the only things I can really see are the USB cable could be bringing in signal, and the top and bottom aren't continuous since I was running out of material, but are two overlapping panels
[01:47:15] <matt_mills[m]> but the 4 sides are 1 continuous piece
[01:47:48] <matt_mills[m]> I closed up the  top and bottom with magnets, but maybe it's not sufficient
[01:48:05] <matt_mills[m]> I mean it's a good 12" overlap
[01:48:16] <patchvonbraun[m]> Overlapped and bonded should be pretty good.
[01:48:41] <matt_mills[m]> then I connected the top and bottom with the side piece with copper tape

[07:16:51] <patchvonbraun[m]> Objects that are above absolute zero emit broad-spectrum EM.   That's the so-called black-body emission.
[07:19:03] <muaddib[m]> <matt_mills[m]> "doesnt the NRQZ still have 5g..." <- Itâ€™s interesting youâ€™d mention that. Agreed on the massive mimo directionality, but I just read an article talking about commercial satcom bands and 5G bands overlapping. Apparently 5G could get into the RX chain at the groundstation. 
[07:19:38] <muaddib[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: And now that term finally has relevance. 
[07:20:54] <patchvonbraun[m]> The hotter an object is, the higher the peak output and the shorter the wavelength of that peak.
[07:21:44] <patchvonbraun[m]> One of the easy tests to see if your microwave weak-signal dish is working is to stick your blazing hot (comparatively) hand in front of the feed.  If your detector output doesn't increase noticably there's something badly wrong.
[07:22:04] <clever> ive also heard somewhere that a cellphone will cause more RF noise when not in range of a tower
[07:22:34] <clever> if its not in contact with a tower, it will be broadcasting at max power (at some interval), trying to get any tower in range to pick it up, and use some beam-steering to answer
[07:22:47] <patchvonbraun[m]> clever: Yup.  Power control.
[07:23:07] <clever> and once it is in contact, it will reduce the tx power, to the bare minimum needed to maintain the link
[07:23:09] <patchvonbraun[m]> But that "max power" in the hand-set is not that much.   1W maybe?
[07:23:39] <clever> the context i originally heard this in, was power savings when deep in the woods
[07:23:52] <clever> its better to just turn the rf off when not in range, to preserve the battery
[07:24:14] <clever> but with NRQZ, i can see how a lack of a tower might make it more noisy
[07:24:53] <muaddib[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: Maybe a CDMA blackberry!
[07:24:56] <clever> but with a tower present, you can regulate how much bandwidth each phone uses, and you could time the bursts to known slots, which you can then reject at the observatory

[16:54:41] <willcode4[m]> Barry Duggan: That's what the (old) gr-eventstream OOT was about. Jacob is there anything from the PDU/FHSS blocks that does this?
[16:55:23] <drmpeg[m]> Clayton (@argilo / VE3IRR): There is one hideous thing I forgot about the bootstrap block. The sample rate of the bootstrap symbols are different than the sample rate of the data symbols (6.144 versus 6.912 Msps). So I have to add a rational resampler inside the block.
[16:58:10] <ClaytonargiloVE3> I guess that shouldn't be too bad since the ratio is 8:9.
[16:59:16] <drmpeg[m]> Yeah, it's not difficult. It's just that it's performance is slower than cold snot on a doorknob.
[16:59:49] <drmpeg[m]> I wonder if it can be redone with an FFT filter.
[17:02:22] <ClaytonargiloVE3> The bootstrap is fixed, so it would only need to be resampled once.
[17:03:16] <drmpeg[m]> Oh yeah. Now I feel better. ðŸ˜…
[17:04:17] <drmpeg[m]> But an FFT based rational resampler might be a good thing for GNU Radio mainline.

[17:28:20] <geraman21[m]> What is the number of samples that a work function receives based on ?
[17:30:09] <drmpeg> Unless you specify it, whatever the scheduler thinks is good.
[17:31:46] <geraman21[m]> Okay, so it is fair to say something like: Gnu Radio sources the incoming signal to the blocks in batches, size of which is determined by the GR scheduler, and is not constant. 
[17:32:43] <drmpeg> Correct. But you can make it deterministic with set_output_multiple().

[17:37:47] <drmpeg> You can always put a printf() of noutput_items in the work() function and see what's going on.
[17:38:53] <drmpeg> Although you may want to reduce the sample rate to not overload the console.
[17:39:46] <willcode4[m]> Putting in a printf may end up changing the answer, too, if it slows the block down.
[17:41:03] <drmpeg> I'm gonna say only if it makes a core go over 100%.

[22:07:35] <flash[m]> geraman21: if you haven't found this description of the scheduler, it should help you: https://static.squarespace.com/static/543ae9afe4b0c3b808d72acd/543aee1fe4b09162d0863397/543aee20e4b09162d0863578/1380223973117/gr_scheduler_overview.pdf

[22:15:02] <BarryDuggan[m]> Notou: and Jacob I will restate my request in a minute, but first, what is the correct way to store a literal byte in the output array? I have `output_items[0][x] = bytes([127])` but get an error
[22:15:28] <BarryDuggan[m]> in Python
[22:15:30] *** Joins: drewlander (~drewlande@173-80-249-48.bklycmtk03.res.dyn.suddenlink.net)
[22:18:56] <funkylab[m]> flash: that's largely still correct; the states on the `run_one_iteration`, and a few things in message handling have changed since 2013
[22:19:44] <funkylab[m]> if you're interested in a way more bird-perspective look at GR scheduling, I'll plug my European GNU Radio days talk from Besancon
[22:21:12] <funkylab[m]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTGxhsSvZ9c
[22:21:18] <Notou[m]> <BarryDuggan[m]> "Notou: and Jacob I will restate..." <- In python, you can use numpy: np.array([127], dtype=np.uint8)
[22:30:39] <miek> BarryDuggan[m]: but in that case, since you're assigning a single value, you can use `output_items[0][x] = 127`
[22:30:40] * BarryDuggan[m] sent a code block: https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/097a980597ecb11c949b74d8e9d73b20e5e2cc0e
[22:31:23] <BarryDuggan[m]> miek: that was my first attempt
[22:32:59] <miek> what went wrong when you tried that?
[22:36:43] <miek> also the reason you're getting out of bounds errors is that the size of input/output items is determined by the scheduler, and it's not large enough for 32 entries. you have to let the scheduler know if you need specific sizes

[22:43:25] <Notou[m]> Good catch
[22:43:41] *** Joins: bandnyquist (~Rheanna@61.171.21.169)
[22:52:29] <BarryDuggan[m]> miek: so where/how do I do that? is that with `forecast()`? I haven't found anything on it in Python
[22:57:36] <funkylab[m]> I think we've actually gotten around to python-wrap `set_output_multiple`, so you can use it in your constructure, Barry
[23:00:22] <willcode4[m]> Need both forecast() and set_output_multiple().
[23:01:31] *** Joins: Killirse (~Killirse@146.120.222.5)
[23:03:05] <Notou[m]> It's a sync block, it doesn't need forecast() but you can indeed put set_output_multiple(32) in the constructor to ensure the work function will be called with at least 32 samples.
[23:05:24] <willcode4[m]> OK, I figured that something that did packet formatting would not have ninput = noutput.

[23:15:34] <BarryDuggan[m]> "put set_output_multiple(32) in the constructor" sounds like C++ terminology
[23:15:34] <BarryDuggan[m]> my current approach is to make a Python source block with PDU input and stream output
[23:15:53] <BarryDuggan[m]> what I showed above is just a skeleton
[23:18:25] <miek> BarryDuggan[m]: for python, within `__init__` you'd add a call to `self.set_output_multiple(32)`
[23:27:36] <BarryDuggan[m]> that got it - thanks!

[23:47:01] <Guest36> can somebody please take a look at this code.
[23:47:17] <Guest36> for some reason my output doesn't stop running.
[23:47:43] <Guest36> and output_items are not transferred as input to next block.
[23:57:13] <geraman21[m]> Hello guys, I am finalyzing my thesis where I describe the GPS module I developed for GR, which finally works xD 
[23:57:13] <geraman21[m]> I would love to add people from GR community who helped me along the way to the acknowledgments. But I only know your aliases in the chat.
[23:57:13] <geraman21[m]> From my memory: Derek, Yamakaja, Funkylab, willcode, Barry, Ryan, beroset, and everyone else I forgot,  if you guys can send me your names in PM's I would be happy to mention you there ! 
[23:57:13] <geraman21[m]> and a big big thanks !
[23:58:34] <jholtom> congratulations geraman21[m]!
