[19:29:47] <arryana> i can tell you what the one serious regret i have is, audrey
[19:30:07] <audrey> why change my routine
[19:30:07] <arryana> though if i'm completely honest, i'd probably still do the same thing again, if i didn't know how it would work out.
[19:30:29] <audrey> biys: Dark is okay. Christmas is over and we can all go back to being God damn Eeyores. :P
[19:30:34] <arryana> when i returned my younger foster son to his mother, she tried to get me to take his dog with me.

[19:30:51] <audrey> Steroids? Me?
[19:30:57] <audrey> Never taken them. The muscle is just genetic.
[19:31:04] <biys> causative_'s rhetoric got me having to read Theaetetus
[19:31:04] <mannequin> not you, arryana
[19:31:09] <arryana> i didn't want to take his dog away from him while he was readjusting to being home, but his mother brought home a sibling pair of pit bulls the next week, and they tore his dog apart.
[19:31:09] <mannequin> the other guy
[19:31:17] <arryana> i wish i had taken him with me, he was a nice dog.

[19:31:28] <ro-bot-o> audrey meant to say: "No, Your Honor, I've never taken performance-enhancing drugs." - Barry Bonds at trial, with his neck wider than his head.
[19:31:41] <audrey> arryana: aw, I'm sorry, that's really sad :(
[19:31:47] <biys> to understand the socratic method
[19:32:07] <arryana> it's been more than thirty years.  so i count myself lucky that i've racked up so few regrets.
[19:34:03] <arryana> i think personally it's just a matter of responsibility. if i don't like my life or something about it, it's my obligation to address it.  or learn to live with it.

[19:35:45] <arryana> growth is pain, but that's not always a bad thing.
[19:36:22] <biys> i'm a bigger fan of wallowing in self pitty th ank you very fucking much
[19:36:24] <biys> HAHA
[19:36:38] <biys> poes law
[19:37:01] <biys> "learn to lvie with it"
[19:37:26] <biys> can a "thought" or living with a "thought" be considered agony?
[19:37:36] <biys> if the "thought" creates a significant amount of dicomfort?
[19:37:40] <biys> discomfort
[19:38:05] <biys> "just stop thinking about it"
[19:38:18] <biys> how do you STOP thinking?  and how do you STOP things from "popping" into your head
[19:38:21] <biys> "thinking"
[19:39:14] <biys> it's like a deer running out on the highway at night
[19:39:18] <biys> i didn't plan to hit it
[19:39:24] <biys> rats with hooves
[19:42:06] <arryana> is it christmas that's got you considering regrets, audrey?
[19:50:25] <arryana> have you seen 'no country for old men'?
[19:51:35] <arryana> there's a quote in it that sums it up, at least for me.
[19:51:40] <arryana> “All the time you spend tryin to get back what's been took from you there's more goin out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.”

[19:57:07] <audrey> arryana: I mean, partly, but there is one regret, which I think you know about, that I pretty much carry around on a daily basis
[19:57:18] <audrey> and i don't mean that in a self pitying way, it's something I've accepted
[19:57:24] <audrey> Oh yeah! Great movie, that.

[20:00:15] <arryana> that's fair, not suggesting regrets aren't valid
