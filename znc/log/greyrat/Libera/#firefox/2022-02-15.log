[10:16:40] <blahboybaz> This is where I'm not really familiar and dont' know
[10:16:53] <blahboybaz> The lappy is aobut a yr old
[10:17:17] <blahboybaz> but I was able to work in figma as recently as a week or so ago
[10:17:23] <blahboybaz> on this machine
[10:17:31] <Cork> blahboybaz: try extracting http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/97.0/linux-x86_64/en-US/firefox-97.0.tar.bz2
[10:17:44] <Cork> and close your browser and start firefox from that folder
[10:17:50] <Cork> and see if you get the same result there
[10:21:16] <blahboybaz> Cork: Well then I may have another challenge -- I like to keep my browser windows and tabs across reboot so the only way I know to do that is I been just shutting down w/ ff still running (for like years now) and then when I fire the computer back up again and launch ff all my windows and tabs are there still (usually quite a few as well as stuff I would not be able to find again bc I wouldn't 
[10:21:22] <blahboybaz> remember it). I know its bad practice but I fear if I shut down ff the normal way that I will never see some of that stuff -- for example one window has at least 50 tabs open that took me over an hour (looking at each individual entry and deciding to open the detail or not)
[10:22:26] <Cork> blahboybaz: just make sure "Open previous windows and tabs" is checked in the settings page
[10:22:37] <Cork> then firefox will restore just the way it was last time you closed it
[10:22:57] <blahboybaz> I'll look for it but I think it used to fail me and is why I started doing what I described above

[10:33:13] <curmudgeon> anyone knows how to solve this video problem. https://imgur.com/6pPnUzg it only happens on youtube. FF 91.6.0esr (64-bit) on gentoo
[10:33:30] <blahboybaz> Looks the same to me
[10:33:53] <Cork> ya, so the gpu is blacklisted for some reason...
[10:34:44] <Cork> blahboybaz: you could try go to about:config => webgl.force-enabled and set that to true
[10:34:55] <Cork> it MIGHT solve your problem, it might also be very slow
[10:35:12] <blahboybaz> I have ublockorigin on my ff but I tried figma with it disabled and no change. Plus the ff from the download (the one in the directory) does the same and it does not have ublockorigin. Plus figma worked with it enabled before this

[10:40:38] <blahboybaz> Cork: It seems like it worked (in the ff from the folder). There's a bunch of new stuff (drivers listed) - a ton of em - in that about:support section now and I can use figma again --  but why? Why / how did this happen?
[10:41:05] <blahboybaz> And my ff fucked me real good on opening back up all the windows / tabs (btw)
[10:41:18] <blahboybaz> only a couple opened up again
[10:41:36] <Cork> blahboybaz: your driver/hardware is blacklisted cause it has some form of serious bugs
[10:41:48] <blahboybaz> great
[10:42:00] <blahboybaz> I think its the foss linux drivers in use tho
[10:42:08] <blahboybaz> at least it was
[10:42:21] <Cork> not really there is only one driver for intel (maintained by intel)
[10:43:19] <blahboybaz> I can find out the name but if I recall correctly I was unable to get the proprietary drivers to work when I tried so I had to stick with the foss one
[10:44:42] <blahboybaz> Cork: This is what's up w/ my driver : https://pasteboard.co/cPes4wRNV8Ji.png
[10:45:13] <Cork> didn't you say you use intel ?!?

[10:45:57] <blahboybaz> I really don't know how to talk about things like that (gpu's and drivers and all that)
[10:46:05] <blahboybaz> not knowledgeable in that
[10:46:24] <W> a gpu can be integrated in a cpu, e.g. in a cheap laptop, and when Cork asked for GPU earlier you answered Intel, which is the most common such integrated GPU
[10:46:33] <blahboybaz> I thought I was using the one listed below the one shown in that screenshot - the xorg driver (but I guess i'm not)
[10:46:43] <mannequin> firefox crashed
[10:46:46] <Cork> W: sure, but this is nvidia drivers...
[10:46:51] <W> but more commonly a GPU is a separate card in the computer used for graphics, aka a graphics card, gfx
[10:46:54] <blahboybaz> oh
[10:46:56] <blahboybaz> sorry
[10:46:58] <mannequin> when i opened it up again it had this weather extension on
[10:47:11] <mannequin> i can't recall did i install it or not
[10:47:14] <blahboybaz> I do have dedicated grephics card in this lappy (paid extra for it)
[10:47:42] <W> mannequin, other applications you install can add in extensions for your browsers, common with "freeware" labelled software
[10:47:52] <blahboybaz> So is what we did earlier (forcing webgl) the best thing to do? Is it the only way to go?
[10:48:08] <W> sometimes these things are added by installer makers for unrelated software
[10:48:12] <Cork> blahboybaz: if you run "lshw 2>/dev/null | grep 'VGA compatible' -A 1 | grep 'product'" in a terminal what do you get?
[10:48:24] <W> (sometimes for all software you can download from a "download site", to be avoided)
[10:48:26] <ede> i still call them "graphics card", this being one of the two reasons (the other one that i'm not convinced about all this mega integration)
[10:48:28] <blahboybaz> I'll see

[10:49:28] <Cork> O_o
[10:49:32] <W> mannequin, this happens for linux software as well, if you download it in such a manner, though there you're probably using your package manager and avoid that trouble
[10:49:35] <blahboybaz> But I do have a (bad ass) dedicated graphics in this machine
[10:49:40] <mannequin> ede: that's what i did in the first place
[10:49:44] <Cork> sooo your using nvidia drivers for an intel gpu...
[10:49:51] <blahboybaz> idk
[10:50:06] <blahboybaz> maybe it is not using the dedicated card for some reason idk
[10:50:06] <Cork> blahboybaz: i would recommend going to #ubuntu and see if they can help you figure out what is going on there

[13:32:45] <dTal> So, this "Sorry. We just need to do one small thing to keep going." thing I keep getting, where Firefox claims to have been updated in the background. What's going on here? I install through my distro package manager, always, and this occurs randomly without me having triggered an update.
[13:33:02] *** Joins: Lucanis (~Lucanis@user/lucanis)
[13:33:10] <Cork> dTal: ya, it is annoying as hell
[13:33:15] <Cork> it means firefox has updated
[13:33:26] <Cork> and when you start a new tab it tries to start a new child process
[13:33:49] <dTal> How can it possibly have updated? It doesn't have write permission to the place it's installed.
[13:34:15] <Cork> but the child process is a different version so they don't know the ipc is compatible so it refuces to start it
[13:34:44] <Cork> dTal: firefox has quite a lot of workarounds to get around write permissions sadly
[13:35:20] <Cork> to the point where it writes to a child folder and replaces the folder where it doesn't have the permission to write
[13:35:28] <Cork> s/child/sibling/
[13:36:30] *** Quits: Cashlin (~hp@user/cashlin) (Remote host closed the connection)

[13:36:59] *** Joins: Cashlin (~hp@user/cashlin)
[13:37:47] <dTal> Although there are some changes in /usr/lib/firefox dating from today, and I'd like very much to know how since that directory is owned by root, and I would never give Firefox root permission.
[13:38:36] <Cork> ya, you most likely want to run a firefox with the updater disabled if it is in /urs

[13:39:14] <Cork> (and yes i've seen the same behavior and it is... urking)
[13:40:04] <Caspy7[m]> CorkdTal this is generally because the distro updater is updating Firefox while its running.
[13:40:16] *** Joins: becks` (~becks`@bbcs-125-80.pub.wingo.ch)
[13:40:49] <dTal> Okay it seems that in this particular instance it was caused by Ubunutu running unattended upgrades - although that was at 6AM so I'm still mystified why it worked until 10 AM.
[13:41:28] <dTal> I guess it heuristically spawns new container processes, so you don't neccesarily hit it right away.
[13:41:40] *** Quits: BiggieSmalls (~BiggieSma@user/biggiesmalls) (Quit: Leaving)
[13:41:55] <Cork> it works until firefox wants to start a new child process
[13:42:03] <Cork> it doesn't fail directly
[13:42:24] <dTal> Okay, mystery solved. Thanks
[13:42:50] <Caspy7[m]> dTal: it's the fault of the updater. If it won't behave, a build from mozilla updates itself and you don't have to worry about this
[13:43:07] <Cork> Caspy7[m]: it behaves EXACTLY the same
[13:43:25] <Cork> if the binary on the disk differs you will get those displays
[13:43:28] <Caspy7[m]> Cork: this was fixed, or should be
[13:43:38] <Cork> had it last week so nope
[13:43:58] <Cork> might be fixed on windows though, as you can't replace the binary on a running process there
[13:44:02] <Caspy7[m]> Cork: did you open up multiple profiles?
[13:44:14] <Caspy7[m]> that used to be the underlying cause other than an updater
[13:44:34] <Cork> no the cause is that the binary is replaced, so when firefox starts the process it is a different ipc
[13:44:55] <Caspy7[m]> Cork: if you use a moz build who is replacing the binary?
[13:45:02] <Caspy7[m]> rather than distro build
[13:45:14] <Cork> it happens on all builds
[13:45:47] <Cork> doesn't bother me that much as i just restart it

[18:15:06] <dalias> so it sees when the new mount appears and shows it in the ui

[18:15:19] <dalias> *all without any interaction with privileges*
[18:15:31] <ede> mount worked for me from the beginning and i see no reason to change my approach.
[18:15:47] <ede> even back in startx + twm days.
[18:15:52] <dalias> mount requires mount to be suid-root which is huge vuln surface
[18:16:06] <dalias> it was bad just in different ways
[18:16:18] <ede> yeah, i remember beep

[18:17:08] <ede> one thing i still don't get is that i can't even mount something -ro if fstab says -rw. i can understand the opposite, but really not that one.
[18:21:24] <dalias> because the security model is just that, as user, you can only mount the exact options allowed
[18:21:49] <dalias> anything else would require mount to be aware of security consequences of the particular options
[18:22:05] <dalias> and "ro" is not necessarily "okay"
[18:22:37] <dalias> you can imagine situations where having the fs present but ro could cause things to go wrong
[18:22:38] <ede> with ro instead of rw i have even less rights. no writing.
[18:22:54] <dalias> you have the ability to prevent someone else from writing
[18:23:03] <dalias> which is an added right
[18:23:35] <ede> hm. then there should be also a "whatever the user likes" flag. but that would complicate things a bit i guess since mount $here is the only thing a user can do. with no options at all.
[18:23:46] <dalias> then you're just running as root
[18:24:09] <ede> that's why i always mount from a root shell
[18:24:14] <dalias> >_<
[18:24:22] <dalias> the real right solution is not having removable media be managed by kernel at all
[18:24:43] <dalias> user running in their own user+mount namespace
[18:24:53] <dalias> and removable media mounted through a fuse instance owned by that user
[18:25:01] <dalias> where you can use whatever options you want
[18:25:13] <dalias> and where malicious fs structures on the media cannot harm the kernel
[18:25:21] <ede> i learned to mount -ro during the days with regular system hangs. if i don't want to write there's no need for -rw
