[00:35:12] <mawk> but 1) why are you allowed to take a C > 0 given that the differential equation it comes from say it's exp(D)
[00:35:14] <cherim> Your differential equation is valid until f(x)=0. If you assume that f is nonzero somewhere at x>0, you can continue it from that point in both directions
[00:35:18] <mawk> and 2) how did you think to do the piecewise thing
[00:35:24] <mawk> hmm

[00:36:30] <cherim> Easy to see that you can't go to negative values, so the piecewise form is forced

[09:29:34] <Guest20> ok. uhm, I'm a little confused for these "Lp spaces". I think an Lp norm of a vector is the sum of the abs value of its components, each raised to power p, and the sum raised to power 1/p.  But I also see the same thing but a integral instead of sum. Why?

[09:33:07] <aaii> LoL
[09:33:44] <aaii> that left was the real answer I guess.
[09:33:51] <Galois> a sum is a finite integral. Presumably you've heard of enough probability theory to understand that there is such a thing as discrete probability (on finite sets), and there is such a thing as continuous probability (on the real line). The analogy between sums and integrals is like the analogy between discrete and continuous probability.
[09:34:23] <Galois> the analogy can be made explicit, by taking a measure on a finite set, and integrating over it; you'll get literally a weighted sum

[10:00:43] <Fangs> this lets you do analysis quite 'easily' in R^n
[10:00:58] <PlanckWalk> There is only one way to make it work for a continuous function with 2 inverses of every point, and surjectivity rules it out.
[10:01:44] <Fangs> tusko: metric spaces are also a very 'nice' example of a topological space, where most of your geometric intuition can translate quite directly. more general topological spaces can be a lot more difficult to work with.

[10:13:52] <greenbagels> vector spaces don't need this concept, but they need some extra operations (scalar multiplication, addition)

[10:17:21] <tusko> so you could have a metric space or a vector space or a 'normed' vector space and those would be different things?
[10:18:08] <tusko> assuming the first metrics space lacked addition and scalar multiplication and the normed vector space had it plus notions of distance?
[10:18:54] <greenbagels> it's kind of like; the normed vector space has a "natural choice" for a metric, but you don't *have* to use it, if that makes sense
[10:19:41] <greenbagels> for example; the space of all at-most-N-degree polynomials is an (N+1)-dimensional vector space
[10:20:24] <greenbagels> there is a metric you could come up with that turns this space into a metric space, but that doesn't mean the polynomial space is automatically / always a metric space; only when you include that as a structure of your space
[10:20:47] <PlanckWalk> E.g. take any y0 so that f(x0) = f(x1) = y0.  The interval in between has some extreme value f(x2) = y2 != y0, and let x3 be the other inverse of y2.  Now wherever you put x2, you get a contradiction.
[10:20:53] <PlanckWalk> Err, wherever you put x3
[10:21:23] <greenbagels> in the reverse sense, you could take a familiar metric space (like R with the distance function d(x,y) = |x-y|) and suddenly "forget" that you can calculate distances
[10:22:04] <greenbagels> you can still take the structure of vector space (R as a 1-D vector space over the field R), but it's no longer a metric space (though this is a bit contrived, admittedly)

[17:44:51] <Simplar> From a given triangle, exactly
[17:45:07] <bay_area_thrash> Simplar, interestingly that problem statement also gives a hint for a way to efficiently calculate it
[17:45:23] <bay_area_thrash> the sum, not the point though
[17:45:35] <bay_area_thrash> Simplar, well the naive method would be to just follow the geometrical procedure
[17:45:43] <bay_area_thrash> Construct a circle of a given side length with those angles
[17:46:00] <bay_area_thrash> then draw the three equilateral triangles
[17:46:19] <bay_area_thrash> and find the intersection of the lines from the vertices of the triangles to opp vertices of the original triangle
[17:46:53] <bay_area_thrash> all individual steps should be possible with some elementary knowldge of rotating lines through an angle, and straight line equations
[17:46:55] <Simplar> The point itself is easy to find
[17:47:00] <Simplar> Yeah.
[17:47:10] <Simplar> But its coords... no

[17:48:12] <Simplar> Stupid me
[17:48:14] <Simplar> Right.
[17:48:20] <Simplar> Thanks for guidance
[17:48:59] <Simplar> So I want to find the coordinates of two vertices (the third will also be in an intersection of the other two anyways)
[17:49:21] <Simplar> And then the coordinates of the intersections of lines through these vertices
[17:49:25] <bay_area_thrash> Simplar, you need to however remember inward vs outward direction
[17:49:40] <bay_area_thrash> Might want to normalize the equations of sides of the original triangle so your vector always points outward not inward
[17:50:06] <bay_area_thrash> The construction involves equilateral triangles but you don't need to make the full triangle, which would have further direction and sign convention related annoyances
[17:50:11] <bay_area_thrash> Just the outer vertex is needed

[17:51:07] <bay_area_thrash> actually you've got me interested and I might try writing my own prorgram for this
[17:51:16] <Simplar> That's awesome tho

[17:51:26] <Simplar> The approach
[17:51:29] <Simplar> It was so obv
[17:51:32] <bay_area_thrash> which approach?
[17:51:42] <Simplar> Analytically repeating geometric construction
[17:51:48] <bay_area_thrash> Oh of course
[17:51:56] <bay_area_thrash> The problem is, often such an approach can be rather inefficient
[17:52:02] <bay_area_thrash> But its good to try it as a first attempt
[17:52:18] <Simplar> The more efficient methods are anyways originating from this

[21:23:11] <riv> R transitive means if aRb and bRc then aRc
[21:23:19] <riv> this holds for your R, trivially
[21:23:27] <riv> 1R1 and 1R1 imply 1R1

[21:29:23] <qergle> adder: R is transitive if (a,b) ∈ R and (b,c) ∈ R ⇒ (a,c) ∈ R

[21:29:51] <adder> I know that
[21:30:23] <qergle> ok, so why isn't it clear that R is transitive?
[21:30:57] <qergle> give me two pairs of the form (a,b) and (b,c) in R such that (a,c) isn't in R.
[21:31:42] <adder> I don't understand if say (a, b) is (1, 1), then what's (b, c)?
[21:31:51] <riv> (1, 1)
[21:31:53] <qergle> if (a,b) is (1,1) then you know b=1
[21:32:07] <qergle> and if (1,c) is in R, what's c?
[21:32:15] <riv> he only pairs (1, x) in R are (1, 1)
[21:32:28] <adder> 1
[21:32:46] <adder> likewise for (2, 2)
[21:33:37] <qergle> therefore you cannot find pairs (a,b) and (b,c) ∈ R such that (a,c) ∉ R. Making R transitive.
[21:34:08] <adder> cool, thanks
[21:34:15] <Z-module> note that in the definition of transitive, "a, b, c" are not assumed to be all distinct, or two the same and one different.  It's totally general.
[21:34:53] <Franciman> Z-module: are you pursuing an academic career?
[21:35:11] <adder> I'm confused on another matter, definition in my book says 'relation R of set A' is [...] transitive: iff for all x, y, z in A (note 'A')
[21:35:30] <int-e> adder: the empty relation is transitive, and so is R = {(1,2)}; you don't actually need any triples a,b,c with (a,b) in R and (b,c) in R.
[21:35:33] <Z-module> only here in Internet Relay College
[21:35:41] <qergle> adder: yes, that's the universe you're in. the relation is over AS
[21:35:45] <qergle> s/AS/A
[21:35:50] <Franciman> lol
[21:35:59] <Franciman> what is the day job of the Professor Z-module ?
[21:36:05] <adder> so I'm asking shouldn't in the relation also be other elements of A?
[21:36:11] <adder> for it to be considered transitive?
[21:36:16] <int-e> Of course for the example you have, (1,1) in R, and (1,1) in R, so you need to check that (1,1) in R. Same for (2,2)...
[21:36:31] <qergle> adder: can you re-phrase that?
[21:37:07] <qergle> are you asking why R doesn't contain tuples with other elements of A (aside from 1,2)?
[21:37:19] <adder> yeah
[21:37:40] <qergle> that's how this relation was defined. it's a subset of AxA.
[21:37:56] <qergle> a relation R on A is *some* subset of AxA
[21:38:08] <adder> yeah ok
[21:38:11] <Z-module> note that EVERY possible subset of A x A (including the empty set or the full set) is some "relation on A".  But not all of them are transitive.
[21:38:23] <int-e> "why" really comes down to "because the definition says so"

[21:39:11] <Z-module> yeah, the word "relation" is a bit misleading. It's not that the things in the various ordered pairs are inherently related to each other by some other properties. It's that we are *defining* this relation using these pairs, for any or no reason.
[21:39:20] <riv> you can state it without refernce to set A
[21:39:23] <qergle> adder: yes, same thing.
[21:39:34] <Z-module> ordered pairs are 2-tuples
[21:39:36] <int-e> adder: For a relation to *not* be transitive, you need to find a,b,c such that (a,b) in R, (b,c) in R, and (a,c) *not* in R.

[22:06:08] <Liblx> Hello, I have a maths problem I tried to solve but I failed. :) I have a list of numbers and I need them in the same relation but in another range. So, at the moment they are between 0.5 and 2 but I need them between 150 and 250. How can I solve it? Thanks a lot.

[22:09:29] <riv> that scales up by a factor of (250-150)/(2-0.5)
[22:09:33] <HisShadow> Liblx: f(x) = 100/1.5(x-0.5) + 150 or something like that
[22:09:39] <qergle> something like (x-0.5)*(1000/15)+150
[22:09:47] <riv> and it's best to move it to origin, then to 150
[22:09:55] <riv> so (input - 0.5) * scale + 150

[23:08:09] <Franciman> I didn't know about this side of him
[23:09:17] <tusko> He had strongly criticized Lagrange for his use of infinite series, introducing instead a novel series expansion for a function. His criticisms of Lagrange were for the most part unfounded but the coefficients in Wroński's new series proved important after his death, forming a determinant now known as the Wronskian (the name which Thomas Muir had given them in 1882).

[23:09:52] <tusko> His earlier correspondence with major figures meant that his writings garnered more attention than a typical crackpot theory, even earning a review from the great mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange (which turned out to be categorically unfavorable). In the ensuing controversy, he was forced to leave the Marseille Observatory.

[23:47:56] <Z-module> in checking transitivity, you *never* need to involve any pair (x,x) at all
[23:48:05] <Z-module> those don't affect anything
