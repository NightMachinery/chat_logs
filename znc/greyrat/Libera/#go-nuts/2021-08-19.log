[09:06:38] <dngray[m]> i was thinking of writing a posix sh script, generated from a go/html template for some certain git related settings
[09:06:53] <dngray[m]> in the past i run this script in a git repo, sets the alias, name, and a few commands
[09:07:14] <dngray[m]> however, i like things to remain somewhat independent of bash, and things like posix sh don't support arrays etc
[09:07:29] <dngray[m]> so i am thinking maybe the easiest solution is just to start writing system scripts i have directly in go
[09:07:36] *** Joins: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn)
[09:08:34] <dngray[m]> these are my options, https://clbin.com/DuF78
[09:08:54] <dngray[m]> essentially i just run the command in the git repo directory
[09:09:06] <dngray[m]> and i have another script, with things related to work that are set
[09:10:09] <dngray[m]> in the past i had generated that from a jinja template https://clbin.com/eSsV4
[09:10:35] <dngray[m]> one of the limitations i've found with chezmoi text/template seems to be you can't really output multiple files
[09:11:13] <dngray[m]> and having a selection option ie with a shell script and `read` has its limitations too, for example you don't really have arrays in sh

[09:19:17] <seebs> posix sh supports arrays-ish using eval, but yeah, go might be a better choice.
[09:19:31] <seebs> i've been thinking about trying to implement something more idiomatically-like a shell in Go but i haven't quite got the feel of it right yet.
[09:22:37] <dngray[m]> so essentially it discovered my problem boiled down to 3 things.
[09:22:55] <dngray[m]> and that being, i can't output to multiple separate files from a template without having a script run that template multiple times
[09:23:28] <dngray[m]> which makes sense, if i had a template populate some variables in a script, and then when the script is run the user selects a number (the variables already populated)

[09:23:51] <dngray[m]>  what you can't do in sh is something nice like arrVar=("AC" "TV" "Mobile" "Fridge" "Oven" "Blender")
[09:24:20] <dngray[m]> and then append ie arrVar+=("Dish Washer")
[09:24:48] <seebs> yeah
[09:24:55] <seebs> but you can get a similar result using eval
[09:25:31] <dngray[m]> hmm maybe i might do that t hen, because it is very basic what i am trying to do
[09:25:31] <seebs> basically: "eval x_$i=\$value" to set, and "eval value=\$x_$i" to retrieve

[12:16:07] <michelem> Hi folks! I have some testing code which works on macOS with go-1.16.5 , and on Linux/Ubuntu with go-1.13.8, but it fails on Debian with go-1.15.9 . The failure is odd: check this out https://dpaste.org/TPDR
[12:16:54] <shibumi> realies: argo-cd is k8s specific yes.
[12:17:15] <michelem> nevermind the "!=" and "vs" in the output, I just changed the string in the editor. That output is actually from that conditional block.
[12:17:28] <shibumi> realies: on what platforms do you want to deploy?
[12:19:11] <nevivurn> michelem: guess would be with something related to the monotonic time, is there a specific reason you can't use (time.Time).Equal?
[12:22:14] <michelem> nevivurn: Thank you, that's good input. I can't use .Equal() because I expect a difference between the two up to 1s, because the serialization truncates any sub-second part.
[12:24:33] <michelem> based on your suggestion I rewrote the disequality as T2-T1 < Duration(1s) and that actually passes the test. Thank you @nevivurn
[12:25:10] <nevivurn> I'm glad that worked, still weird. I checked, and both Round and Truncate seem to strip out the monotonic time.

[17:05:38] <bookworm> what this means in stuff like `go build ./...` ?
[17:05:52] <MrElendig> ./ is the current dir, ... could mean anything
[17:06:04] <fizzie> "The current package and all its subpackages."
[17:06:09] <bookworm> well, generally it's for things like... ^ that
[17:06:43] <bookworm> allows you to build several binaries at the same time for instance
[17:07:26] <fizzie> Or run all the tests, I imagine that's where you'd see it most often.
[17:08:12] <fizzie> `go help packages` will explain the syntax for specifying packages.
