[00:44:00] <FromGitter> <kassick> @mughalgit try moving your `(setq  org-todo-keywords ...)` to `dotspacemacs/user-init` instead of `user-config`
[00:47:20] <FromGitter> <kassick> your issue brought me back bad memories from some 5 years ago ;)
[00:47:31] <FromGitter> <kassick> https://github.com/kassick/dotfiles/commit/41077cc6c7897cdbff7a8fe358f99e92870c0534
[00:48:43] <FromGitter> <kassick> If what's happening to you is similar to what happened to me back then, the issue is that `user-config` happens too late in the initialization when you call emacs with a file as argument
[00:49:22] <FromGitter> <kassick> that means that org has already initialized for the buffer, it has already checked the values it's variables and set itself up accordingly
[00:49:33] <FromGitter> <kassick> then, some sime later, user-config executes and adjust the values
[00:50:21] <FromGitter> <kassick> but, in my experience, some corners of org-mode only reflect new settings after you `org-restart`-ed your buffer
[00:50:59] <FromGitter> <kassick> that may answer why the variables are set correctly when you `describe-variable` them, but org does not seem to behave as expected
[00:51:34] <FromGitter> <kassick> setting stuff in user-init has fixed it for me, as it's executed before loading the file
[00:54:12] <FromGitter> <kassick> that said: user-init code may execute before packages are installed (or modules loaded), so beware of symbols that may be not present during startup, of modules that will be autoloaded by referencing some symbol, and all sort of initialization hell
[01:19:52] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> that's really helpful
[01:20:33] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> use custom-set-variables in user-init should be the way to go. it has no effect until the custom variable is declared
[01:46:00] <FromGitter> <kassick> I did not know that about custom-set-variables ! That may shave some eval-after-load's off from my setup :)
[01:59:24] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Applying-Customizations.html
[01:59:42] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> this should be the preferred way of setting customization variables
[02:01:20] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> there's no eval-after-load
[02:09:25] <FromGitter> <mughalgit> Hey Rodrigo!! That did it !!!! You are a GENIUS!!!!
[02:10:10] <FromGitter> <mughalgit> I'm always amazed how people on these forums are willing to help out total strangers!
[02:16:27] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I still don't understand why "emacs FILE" breaks things...
[04:46:34] <FromGitter> <kassick> always glad to help :D
[04:48:19] <FromGitter> <kassick> user-config is run in `emacs-startup-hook` , which appears to be fired only *after* creating the buffer for the file in the cmdline arguments
[04:49:56] <FromGitter> <kassick> in the case of org-mode, it appears that setq'ing global variables after a buffer is is already initialized with org-mode does not trigger some necessary state changes -- probably because org has a lot of state that's buffer specific
[04:53:38] <FromGitter> <kassick> by the time @mughalgit was inspecting the variable, the global symbol was set accordingly, but the buffer-local variables that define org internal state for that buffer had already been derived from the original value
[05:01:55] <FromGitter> <kassick> i.e. `C-c C-t` does not cycle through the values stored in the global `org-todo-keywords` , but on some internal state derived from the value of the variable at the time that org was initialized for the buffer
[05:04:37] <FromGitter> <kassick> ``````
[05:05:42] <FromGitter> <kassick> the handling command line arguments part includes creating the buffer and starting the major mode
[05:46:46] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> okay. I think this is important to know.
[05:48:17] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I've never wrong "emacs FILE" so I never encountered this issue
[05:48:28] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> *run
