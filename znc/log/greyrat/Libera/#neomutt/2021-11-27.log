[02:25:37] <edward> What's the best way of archive mail? In the past I looked at archivemail, it can take a Maildir and move messages older than 30 days into a compressed mbox. archivemail is no longer maintained and needs porting from Python 2 to Python 3. Does anybody know if an alternative mail archiver, or can I configure neomutt to archive my mail?

[14:58:21] <gour> anyone using tagging feature (https://neomutt.org/feature/custom-tags) ?
[14:59:30] <gour> i want to migrate my old mail archive from claws and would like to re-tag some messages to be able to quickly find them querying by tag
[15:03:01] *** Joins: nyah (~nyah@94.6.71.219)
[15:09:28] <flatcap> is your archive local or imap?
[15:16:21] <gour> local maildir
[15:18:22] <gour> emacs client for mu (mu4e) can add custom tags, so wonder whether it can be done with neomutt or simply to use notmuch...although it keeps tags along with the messages, which has its pro/cons...thinking if the database get corrupt
[15:19:37] <flatcap> both imap and notmuch use their own tagging behind the scenes...
[15:20:02] <flatcap> to get the most of out the custom tagging you'd need to use notmuch
[15:20:47] <gour> flatcap: ok, another 'pro' to use notmuch which is already prepared in your copr
[15:20:54] <flatcap> :-)
[15:21:08] <flatcap> once tagged, you can create virtual folders from queries IN neomutt
[15:21:28] <flatcap> here's jindraj's notmuch dotfile: https://github.com/jindraj/dotfiles/blob/master/.neomutt/neomuttrc.mailboxes
[15:22:22] <flatcap> he's created lots of folders for common tags, and you can create a new temporary "view" at any time with <vfolder-from-query>
[15:23:09] <flatcap> he's also using "tag-transforms" (the config is mind-melting), but it allows you to use icons to represent tags in the index
[15:25:40] <gour> yes, his setup is already known to me - now it's maybe time to deploy it, although i definitely do not have use-case for so many tags & virtual folders ðŸ˜„
[15:25:57] <flatcap> :-)
[15:26:08] <flatcap> I must get around to tidying my config too
[15:26:29] <gour> i should ask jindraj whether he experienced db corruption at any time...
[15:27:01] <bookworm> the notmuch db? Never happened to me once and I've been using if for a few years now
[15:27:34] <bookworm> it's easy enough to dump the tags too, for backup purposes
[15:27:53] <flatcap> good to know
[15:28:02] <bookworm> meaning as long as you still have the mail, simply re-import and re tag
[15:28:17] <bookworm> (as in import the dump)
[15:28:29] <bookworm> notmuch is essential xapian
[15:28:41] <bookworm> and that thing is rather stable :)
[15:29:56] <gour> bookworm: yeah, i'm just cautious about possible need to re-tag since that is, in my case, pretty manual task
[15:31:02] <gour> do you also handle addressbook contacts with notmuch?
[15:42:56] <bookworm> notmuch doesn't handle contacts, it indexes mail
[15:43:06] <bookworm> use khard or something
[15:44:22] <gour> bookworm: so does mu, but it can be used with e.g. "set query_command = "mu cfind --format=mutt-ab '%s'"
[15:45:18] <bookworm> there's a difference between contacts and "adresses that sent email to me"
[15:45:32] <bookworm> the latter can be done with notmuch too iirc
[15:46:07] <gour> great, i'm interested for that ðŸ˜‰
[15:47:03] <bookworm> notmuch address from:"$*"
[15:47:18] <bookworm> the manpage should have more info
