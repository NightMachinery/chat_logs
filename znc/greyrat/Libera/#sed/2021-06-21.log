[02:37:16] <Torr> Let's say I have a string with entries like: word1_word2_word3: text text
[02:37:43] <Torr> The goal is to titlecase every "word#" occurrence.
[02:38:11] <Torr> So far, this is what I've come up with: 	| sed "s/\(\w\)\(\w\+\)/\u\1\2/:"
[02:39:12] <Torr> This only works with the first occurrence of "word#".
[02:39:41] <Torr> How would I expand this to be applied for them all?
[02:40:24] <Torr> If there were a way to make sed replace until a character I could finish this.
[02:40:58] <Torr> Ops
[02:42:00] <Torr> This is the sed command up to now: sed "s/\(\w\)\(\w\+\):/\u\1\2:/"

[02:53:38] <larryv> the text following : is completely arbitrary?
[02:53:54] <Torr> Yes
[03:11:59] <larryv> Torr: try this maybe: sed 'h; s/:.*/:/; s/\([[:alnum:]]\+\)/\u&/g; x; s/[^:]*://; H; g; s/\n//g'
[03:16:51] <larryv> slight refinement: sed 'h; s/:.*//; s/\([[:alnum:]]\+\)/\u&/g; x; s/[^:]*//; H; g; s/\n//g'
[03:19:00] <Riviera> What's the task,
[03:19:07] <Riviera> to uppercase every word until the first ":"?
[03:19:43] <larryv> "Let's say I have a string with entries like: word1_word2_word3: text text" "The goal is to titlecase every "word#" occurrence."
[03:20:10] <larryv> later clarified to mean only up until :
[03:20:32] <Riviera> hm, so since you rely on GNU sed, you can also rely on word boundary regexes, right?
[03:20:35] <Riviera> hmmm.
[03:21:00] <Riviera> now i wish i would remember which that were for GNU sed.
[03:21:34] <Riviera> ha-ha damn
[03:21:42] <Riviera> _ is a word-character :D
[03:23:00] <larryv> yerp haha
[03:23:11] <Torr> larryv: Worked marvelously.
[03:23:38] <Torr> Thank you.
[03:23:42] <larryv> whew
[03:24:06] <larryv> -_-;;
[03:24:07] <Riviera> sed ':a; s/\(^\|[^[:alnum:]]\)\([[:lower:]]\+.*:\)/\1\u\2/; ta'
[03:24:19] <larryv> D:
[03:24:40] <Riviera> strictly GNU sed only, and larryv's is likely better; I was just looking for a distraction from the hot weather :D
[03:25:12] <larryv> yeah i wouldn't bet on that haha
[03:26:07] <Riviera> mine only works for a single :
[03:26:18] <Riviera> anyway, problem seems solved :)

[20:15:19] <slidercrank> is it possible to insert a line into an empty file with sed? I guess not
[20:18:54] *** Joins: nate1 (~nate@216.176.47.241)
[20:20:13] <yitz> echo line >> file
[20:26:42] <slidercrank> that's not how the question was formed. I know about >
[20:27:05] <slidercrank> the task is to avoid |, <, >, >>,<<
[20:27:43] <slidercrank> the only solution I've come up with is cp /proc/version filename;  sed -i 's/^.*$/hello/' filename 
[20:28:04] <slidercrank> first create a non-empty file. then replace its line
[20:28:40] <Soliton> you could use a file editor instead.
[20:29:27] <slidercrank> automatically
[20:29:33] <slidercrank> not manually
[20:30:08] <geirha> so use a file editor automatically
[20:32:36] <e36freak> ed is the standard editor
[20:33:33] <slidercrank> I thought about ed. but what's the command then?
[20:33:43] <Soliton> ed
[20:33:54] <slidercrank> the command to solve the task, not to invoke ed
[20:34:09] <slidercrank> create a file named "test.txt" with the content "hello" using ed
[20:34:33] <Soliton> ed -s test.txt <<< $'i\nhello\n.\nwq'
[20:35:15] <slidercrank> :(
[20:35:24] <slidercrank> you're using redirection
[20:35:44] <Soliton> that is how ed works. it reads commands from stdin.
[20:35:57] <Soliton> you're doing some non sense homework?
[20:36:17] <slidercrank> no
[20:36:50] <Soliton> you came up with a non sense task yourself?
[20:37:05] <slidercrank> it's some crazy shell where such things don't work well or don't work at all. So the ideal command would be 'command line filename' allowing to write 'line' to 'filename'
[20:37:40] <Soliton> maybe you can call a non-crazy shell from that shell.
[20:38:13] <slidercrank> the question was specifically about sed. It was enough to confirm that sed doesn't allow to do that
[20:38:54] <Soliton> it doesn't sound like you have an empty file anyway. it sounds like you want to create a file.
[20:39:12] <slidercrank> touch 'filename' c
