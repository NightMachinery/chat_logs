[01:57:21] <Earnestly> bluray: supervisor, like systemd, runit, s6, etc., exist to supervise process.  if you undercut their control then they can only respond to signal and behave as configured because they have no external knowledge of your rationale for such action
[01:58:18] <Earnestly> there is no concordance between supervisor control and some set of unix tooling to achieve the same action, in any supervisor

[06:58:19] <pycurious> Scimmia: am i bypassing pacman in that dockerfile? The only command I use in that docker file is to test pip - which fails
[06:58:43] <Scimmia> pycurious: I already told you how to fix it, update from an up-to-date mirror
[06:58:48] <pycurious> Scimmia: I'm not installing pyparsing - pacman is 
[06:59:00] <pycurious> Scimmia: how do i do that? what command?

[06:59:21] <Scimmia> pycurious: if you don't know how to update your system, you shouldn't be anywhere near Arch
[06:59:48] <pycurious> Scimmia: This image was updated 2 days ago - why do you think an updated mirror would fix the issue? You think there was a bugfix sent in the last 2 days for this issue? 
[07:00:09] <Edu4rdSHL> Because the package was updated 15 hours ago?
[07:00:16] <Scimmia> pycurious: did you read anything I said earlier?
[07:00:22] <thrice> actually, twice within the last 2 days
[07:02:43] <pycurious> Scimmia: I see the 15 hour old update on my issue then. I just need to figure out how to pull that update
[07:03:18] <Edu4rdSHL> Running pacman -Syu ?

[07:04:53] <Edu4rdSHL> pycurious, if you build that image right now, you will not face the problem anymore.
[07:04:59] <Edu4rdSHL> Just rebuild that image
[07:05:46] <pycurious> Edu4rdSHL: That image takes 2 hours to build. My last build is still running on the 17 day old version of arch - and has not failed yet. My guess is that will go through. After that I can try it again on "latest"

[07:22:48] <ufo> Im using the kitty terminal + tmux. When inside SSH, I can only copy up to 100+ lines. The same effect is happening with Alacritty. Which leads me to suspect, maybe its related to a system configuration. In the terminal (outside SSH). I can copy as many lines as needed. Anyone have any ideas on what I should be looking at?

[17:28:30] <lf94> ...this package was stupid easy to understand.
[17:28:33] <Scimmia> yep, it depends on ledger-udev

[18:30:12] <MarkYork> Hello everyone. Happy friday! I got my hands on a new laptop and I'm on the process of installing Arch on a RAID 0 array. My current partitioning scheme is simple: /dev/sda1 = EFI with fat32 | /dev/sda2 = boot with ext4 | RAID array = /dev/sda3 & /dev/sdb3. I set everything up according to the installation guide, added the modules and hooks in the initrd with mkinitcpio and setup thr boot loaded accordingly. However, when I 
[18:30:13] <MarkYork> boot, it gets stuck at Starting Load/Save RF Kill Switch Status...

[22:46:55] <SysGhost> talking about nspawn, It don't have the same level of isolation as a vm, so security-wise it's not the same, right?

[22:47:35] <MrElendig> correct
[22:48:00] <Edu4rdSHL> Right, containers in general doesn't have the same isolation level as VMs, that not only apply to nspawn but containers in general

[22:48:32] <Edu4rdSHL> However, they are a lot more convenient than VMs imo
[22:48:46] <SysGhost> and more efficient.

[22:49:11] <Edu4rdSHL> {Yep
[22:49:17] <SysGhost> I've reconsidered reducing my VM's and group some stuff into containers.
[22:49:31] *** Joins: dennisschagt (~quassel@user/dennisschagt)
[22:49:44] <mags> looks like you can run x-apps and everything in nspawn containers too (if you really wanted to)
[22:49:48] <Edu4rdSHL> I only have a VM currently, for windows, doing some pentesting among other things.
[22:49:55] <Edu4rdSHL> mags, yes, that's correct. :)

[22:50:32] <mags> I'm going to have to mess around with it a little, it's been on the list and it's a rainy day...
[22:50:36] <SysGhost> ...but a VM is neat when it comes to backups. I don't have to care much about drivers and such when cloning/restoring machines. Doesn't matter what hardware the host is running as long the vm's can run on it.
[22:50:39] <Edu4rdSHL> https://github.com/Edu4rdSHL/linuxscripts/blob/8acc4a6bff033db7291d701169beb8d5c278f3eb/etc/systemd/nspawn/ArchLinux.nspawn#L7 that's almost everything you need.
[22:50:58] <Edu4rdSHL> mags, if you want, you can join #nspawn-org for nspawn-related questions :)
[22:52:00] <Edu4rdSHL> SysGhost, yep, that's correct too. I have BTRFS here and RAID1 setup so I don't care much about container "backups" and they're almost "backup-ed"
