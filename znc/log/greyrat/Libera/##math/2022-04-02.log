[00:12:45] <somiaj> greenbagels: haha
[00:13:05] <Z-module> e^(pi sqrt(163)) = (-1)^(-i sqrt(163))   and that exponent is algebraic irrational, so the value is actually transcendental.

[00:16:07] <Xardas> thanks guys !
[00:16:11] <ihate> (strictly speaking x^3 + 7 is only one function, however)
[00:16:35] <somiaj> depending on the context it may not even be a function
[00:16:40] <Z-module> The easy test is that if g is any even function, you must have g(0) = 0.   x^3 + 7 fails there.
[00:16:47] <Z-module> sorry, I meant odd
[00:17:13] <somiaj> Z-module: do you need continuity there to make that true?
[00:17:25] <Z-module> no
[00:17:51] <somiaj> so why isn't f(x) = x if x!=0 and f(0) = 12 not odd?
[00:17:52] <Z-module> g odd   means  g(-x) = -g(x) for all x   means   g(0) = -g(0)  so  g(0) = 0

[00:39:50] <ihate> try geogebra

[03:02:27] <snake> Fangs, he says the answer is 2
[03:02:33] <snake> i said it was 1
[03:03:14] <Fangs> its not that (+) is *.. (+) is min(_,_)

[03:05:24] <snake> regular algebra is defined as a tuple where R is real numbers * is multiplication and + is addition (R, *, +) and min-plus was defined as (R, +, *) where + is addition, and * is min(_,_)
[03:06:32] <snake> if you ask me to solve a string using min plus algebra, i expect it to consist of the min-plus algebra operators and not have to be translated first
[03:06:35] <Fangs> thats not how you'd normally define min-plus algebra
[03:06:45] <snake> well that's how he wrote it on the board
[03:07:39] <Fangs> if you use (+) := min(_,_), (*) := "+"... min(1+(min(1+1,1),1+1)
[03:08:01] <Fangs> min(1+1,1+1) = 2
[03:08:11] <snake> oh and the numbers included infinity
[03:08:17] <Fangs> yeah
[03:08:31] <Fangs> infinity is the "0" of (+) := min

[03:08:57] <snake> but i guess i was cconfused because its dumb LOL
[03:10:08] <snake> i do remember doing the translation on the board.. guess i wont waste bossman prof's time by asking him then
[03:10:44] <Fangs> i dont know where they are used for but i know its a pretty "standard" object

[03:11:20] <snake> 0 is a possible number btw, so infinity is just oo
[03:11:42] <Fangs> 0 is the (*) identity
[03:11:45] <snake> you can even have edges with a negative distancy

[03:19:44] <snake> its like for the tuple, you keep the operations in order of precedence, but plus should be first, so they sort .... THE MEANING OF THE SYMBOL, instead of rearranging the symbols
[03:20:04] <snake> (plus meaning addition not the symbol)
[03:22:52] <snake> oh i even had that backwards too, reg. algebra then was written (R, +, *) with * having higher precedence, then min plus is.... (R, +, *)... and you rearrange the meaning if the symbols, leaving the symbols themselves in position (R, min, plus)
[03:24:44] <Fangs> snake: thats why they used the symbol (*) for the "+"

[06:46:43] <Z-module> Very neat thing I just learned. Fix any integer r >= 2, and let F be some nonempty finite set of positive integers. If (a_n) is any sequence of elements of F that is generated by a finite automaton, then SUM_n a_n / r^n   is transcendental, unless (a_n) is eventually constant in which case the sum is rational.
[06:47:40] <Z-module> Hmm, so that means your 0.1010010001.... is transcendental!
[06:47:50] <Z-module> Unless I misunderstood something.

[06:52:11] <berndj> my mind boggles at how you even find something like that. i'd have no idea what search terms to use!
[06:52:12] <Fangs> I dont know finite automata stuff all that well, but sounds like it should have been generatable by an automata
[06:52:18] <Z-module> I think the Loxton result is misquoted in a paper that I'm actually reading.

[13:38:11] <greenbagels> so if you look at the C = 2 pi r relation that river pointed out, you can still use this interpretation for any other point by imagining a smaller or larger concentric circle

[13:42:47] <cadmio> Hello
[13:44:59] <cadmio> I need to find the splitting field over Q of x^4 −7x^2 + 10 in Q[x]
[13:46:07] <cadmio> I think it's irreducible since none of {±1,±2,±5,±10} is a root

[14:08:00] <cadmio> is it correct?
[14:08:18] <Fangs> cadmio: what's the theorem you're using to reduce the roots you're checking to just those 8 numbers?
[14:08:27] <greenbagels> rational root theorem, right?
[14:08:36] <cadmio> greenbagels: exact
[14:08:38] <Fangs> (I genuinely don't know. that sounds like a useful theorem theorem, and I think I remember that's a theorem)
[14:10:01] <greenbagels> yes cadmio i agree you can just check those 8 by the RRT
[14:10:13] <cadmio> none of those seem a root
[14:10:19] <greenbagels> but i didnt check whether they work or not so im going to just trust u on that
[14:10:49] <Fangs> oh neat
[14:11:01] <Fangs> cadmio: so for polynomial of degree 1, 2, and 3
[14:11:28] <cadmio> this means that there's no linear factor
[14:11:32] <Fangs> if p(x0) = 0 for some x0, then p(x) = q(x)*(x-x0) right?
[14:12:02] <cadmio> yes
[14:12:10] <Fangs> so deg(p) = deg(q) + 1
[14:12:12] <cadmio> so there's no (x-x0) in the factorization
[14:12:15] <Fangs> sure

[14:12:22] <Fangs> 4*
[14:12:40] <cadmio> it could be degree(3) * degree(1)
[14:12:54] <Fangs> you just checked and it's not

[14:14:13] <Fangs> cadmio: let y = x^2, now its a quadratic function in y
[14:14:20] <Fangs> so you should be able to factorize that
[14:14:55] <greenbagels> hah i guess it might have also been just as easy to recognize the even powers thing and just hit it with the quadratic formula heh
[14:15:24] <greenbagels> and then do some fun ad hoc garbage
[14:15:59] <river> the question I find interesting is given P(X), when is Q[X]/(P(X)) the splitting field?

[14:26:25] <greenbagels> yes its the root in x^2

[14:26:26] <greenbagels> not in x
[14:28:40] <cadmio> so that "something" canno be any of {±1,±2,±5,±10}

[14:44:32] <cadmio> and by long division y^2 - 7y + 10 = (y-5)(y-2)
[14:44:57] <cadmio> or notice that 2 is also a root...
[14:45:01] <Fangs> 2*5 = 10, seems believable
[14:46:19] <Fangs> cadmio: did you ever fixed your multiplication table from last time
[14:46:28] <Fangs> it was still not symmetric last time you linked it here
[14:47:14] <cadmio> well to finish this the splitting field is Q(sqrt2, sqrt5)
[14:47:31] <river> how do you know that the polynomial fully splits in that field?
[14:48:01] <Fangs> river: do you have an example ready where a field extension is not the splitting field?
[14:49:57] <cadmio> river: if you replace back x^2 it yields x^4 −7x^2 + 10 =(x^2-5)(x^2 -2)
[14:49:58] <Fangs> (its fine if you dont.. just trying to re-learn these stuff myself)
[14:50:14] <river> Fangs: any non-normal extension, e.g. x^3-2

[14:51:27] <Fangs> but the field is entirely real
[14:51:50] <Fangs> how do you tell if its normal vs non-normal off the bat like that though

[17:41:11] <Guest54> hey guys I'm trying to compare two doubles, with relative precision. Concretely, one double is a user input value, the other is a value from 3rd party api. For my app, `a` is more likely to be a precise value that user actually intended (rather than rounding error) and `b` values can be funky. For eg, `a` can be 0 and `b` can be 8e-10 -- in which
[17:41:11] <Guest54> case I want them to be equal. I have implemented a function here https://godbolt.org/z/TPqW9Ee7Y
[17:42:03] <Guest54> The implementation is a bit "weird", in that it interprets epsilon as absolute for 0 case, relative for non-zero cases. But it works and passes the test cases. I'm looking for some feedback on whether my implementation makes sense

[17:45:53] <int-e> Guest54: You often have both a relative error and an absolute error... and the absolute error will dominate near 0. (That's still simplified... the whole computation tends to matter. For example, in the case of destructive cancellation when subtracting numbers, the absolute error is preserved (more or less), but since the result is near 0, the relative error is amplified.)
[17:47:32] <int-e> Guest54: with that in mind, it makes more sense to test for a being near 0 rather than exactly 0 to decide whether to check for an absolute or a relative error
[17:47:53] <Guest54> hmm I see, thanks for the feedback
[17:48:22] <Guest54> so, for cases that not exactly 0 (eg: 0.5), I'm using relative errors
[17:48:55] <Guest54> for eg, if user specifies a lower bound of 0.005 and the value form api is 0.006, then those should not be considered equal values
[17:49:00] <Guest54> (even though the difference is super small)

[17:50:46] <Guest54> because if the user wanted to be that precise, then it makes sense to me that that 0.005 and 0.006 shouldn't be considered equal
[17:51:50] <Guest54> whereas if they specify 0, and the value from api is 0.0006, then I feel like this should be considered equal. I think this logic aligns with the idea of relative precision...
