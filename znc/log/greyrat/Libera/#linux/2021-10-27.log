[01:11:11] <tomg> well,. it used to boot LMDE all the time, so i assume it's off, and it's a very old computer... but i'll check to see if i can find it
[01:11:16] <ayecee> i was going to ask if the installer was booted via EFI or MBR, but i don't have anywhere to go from there
[01:11:39] <ayecee> internets say T420 doesn't have secureboot, so i guess not that
[01:11:49] <tomg> yeah there's no ESP, and it appears to be using GRUB MBR
[01:12:01] <tomg> maybe the system is trying to boot EFI but it only has MBR?

[05:34:53] <Sauvin> Dagmar, that's kinda the point, in my case: they use libraries and/or library versions I can't (easily) get or build.

[05:35:15] <Dagmar> Sauvin: In most cases it's going to be things you didn't _want_ to build

[05:35:38] <Dagmar> Not because they're a pain but because they're super-sketchy

[05:48:13] <Dagmar> I mean, if they're really closed-source, Google should probably do some internal housekeeping and do something about that googlesource.com site giving away all their trade secrets
[05:48:14] <Sauvin> Something funny going on. I'm digging.
[05:48:15] <Psi-Jack> And Ubuntu 20.04 comes with Firefox pre-installed.
[05:48:24] <Psi-Jack> So, it being snapped, is FALSE for 20.04./
[05:48:43] <bparker> Dagmar: are you seriously trying to argue that Chrome is not closed source ??
[05:48:48] <bparker> get a load of this guy
[05:48:56] <onelegend> yo chill
[05:48:59] <onelegend> no need for personal attacks
[05:49:02] <Dagmar> Can you _read_?
[05:49:20] <Dagmar> I literally used to compile Chrome on my K6-333Mhz laptop
[05:49:33] <Dagmar> Not Chromium, _actual Chrome_
[05:49:37] <Sauvin> Maybe I'm just scatterbrained. I could have sworn I've run Chromium by accident on this install, but I can't find it.
[05:49:44] <Caffeinated> gosh wowwy wow wow
[05:49:48] <Dagmar> We jumped through what hoops there were and were quite allowed to compile it that way
[05:49:51] <Psi-Jack> Dagmar: Microsoft doesn't release /actual chrome/ source code.

[05:50:25] <Dagmar> So... I'm pretty sure unless some massive change happened and I missed the screaming that would inevitably occur on multiple news sites I read each day, it's not "closed source"
[05:50:38] <bparker> my god
[05:50:52] <bparker> first result for "chrome closed source" ... "Google Chrome is a closed source web browser based on Chromium"
[05:50:53] <Psi-Jack> Nor have they ever.
[05:51:06] <Dagmar> "Proprietary freeware, based on open source components. ... Most of Chrome's source code comes from Google's free and open-source software project Chromium, but Chrome is licensed as proprietary freeware."
[05:51:27] <bparker> sounds like closed source to me.
[05:51:30] <bparker> and everyone else
[05:51:33] <Dagmar> If I search for "chrome testicular cancer" the first search result will be equally useful
[05:51:57] <bparker> :facepalm:

[05:52:19] <bparker> or just fscking search it yourself
[05:52:23] <bparker> but actually read
[05:52:31] <domhnall> think it just means privately owned...not specifically closed sourced.
[05:52:32] <Dagmar> Obviously you're never seeing the source code to the DRM components
[05:52:39] <Dagmar> The rest of it is another matter entirely
[05:52:40] <Sauvin> bparker, mind the language.
[05:52:54] <bparker> Sauvin: same for Dagmar and his attitude
[05:53:00] <bparker> 'can you read'
[05:53:08] <Dagmar> My "attitude" is because my _experience_ directly contradicts your claims
[05:53:09] <Psi-Jack> And false narratives.
[05:53:13] <bparker> ^
[05:53:14] <Sauvin> Dagmar knows what he's talking about. I'm not convinced that you do, bparker.
[05:53:18] <bparker> Sauvin: ROFLMAO
[05:53:27] <bparker> this is rich
[05:53:32] <Dagmar> If you want I think I can probably find the URLs for some of the packages I built
[05:53:50] <Dagmar> Not sure if saxa is keeping that up but I still see emails from the repo
[05:53:55] <Psi-Jack> I can point out though at least with Ubuntu 20.04, Firefox is not, by default, provided as a snap.

[05:57:45] <Dagmar> Some components of it being closed-source does not make the entire thing closed-source.
[05:57:48] <Sauvin> Dagmar, you mean you don't wear gloves, a skin suit and a positive flow moon suit when you handle mercury-based substances?
[05:57:54] <bparker> in fact, it does exactly mean that.

[06:36:06] <Dagmar> oops: Those are the specific keys used by the project
[06:36:22] <Dagmar> For a lot of people, what that amounts to is a somewhat opportunistic trust root
[06:36:56] <Dagmar> You can at least trust that, say, if you imported those keys six years ago, anything signed by them is generally going to be the same people that were signing them six years ago
[06:37:12] <dviola> Dagmar | fsck isn't going to spot that
[06:37:21] <Dagmar> Without further proof of who _those_ people are, that's as much as you can trust those signatures, and no farther

[06:38:14] <Dagmar> dviola: fsck checks the filesystem for consistency.  Only a detailed surface scan of the disk is going to reveal that one or more of your files is now damaged because every attempt at accessing a particular sector results in the drive throwing back an error at you
[06:38:35] <Dagmar> This is one of the reasons we try to strongly discourage disconnecting media while you're writing to it
[06:38:59] <Dagmar> It's easy enough to fix those kinds of sector errors, but the data that was written there is very much gone
[06:39:03] <bparker> Psi-Jack: sorry, I meant 21.10. but according to "docker run -it --rm ubuntu:21.10 bash -c 'apt update && apt show firefox'" it's still a .deb

[06:40:28] <dviola> ok

[06:40:49] <dviola> ok

[06:42:29] <Dagmar> You may need to overwrite up to 64 sequential sectors depending on how large your disk is

[06:44:35] <Dagmar> oops: There's a whole bunch of keyservers out there, not just the main one.  There's still a possibility those keys were actually uploaded to some other keyserver
[06:44:53] <Dagmar> dviola: That depends on what type of controller it is.  smartctl _can_ talk "through" more than a few
[06:45:09] <Dagmar> Basically, if smartctl doesn't tell you to bugger off, you're probably good
[06:45:19] <dviola> and this is a SSD, does SMART applies?
[06:45:29] <Dagmar> I have only on a couple of occasions had to go check the man page to tell it to try alternate protocols
[06:45:40] <Dagmar> Yep.  SSDs are _very_ likely to have SMART
[06:46:06] <Dagmar> ...because manufacturers prefer to have some code they control verify an SSD is bad _before_ dealing with a warranty complaint.
[06:46:24] <Dagmar> You can usually get them to fess up the total number of lifetime writes as well

[07:30:54] <Dagmar> Yeah it's one of the things I could get my hands on that could export in a format which was usable by Unity when I started messing with that
[07:31:11] <Sauvin> What is Unity and what formats can it take?
[07:31:15] <rascul> i know about the p-guy who had a theory about squares

[07:31:47] <rascul> oh it was a theory about triangles i mean
[07:31:49] <rascul> but the numbers have squares
[07:31:55] <rascul> shapes are weird
[07:32:05] <neshpion> Sauvin: Unity is a game engine and it can take a variety of 3D model formats like .obj and even .blend files directly from blender

[07:35:40] <rascul> you have to socialize before you can pay money?
[07:35:59] <rascul> or did i read that wrong?
[07:36:02] <Dagmar> neshpion: I don't know what they've assembled the platform on, but the primary devel environment for making things for it is definitely Unity
[07:36:06] <neshpion> i read that as $9 to skip the socializing step

[07:36:11] <rascul> oh
[07:36:18] <rascul> that probably makes more sense

[07:39:07] <neshpion> Dagmar: i think the pressure against furryism probably just cuts down on the "softcore" furries, so the ones you see IRL are *only* the hardcore fetishistic ones, and the softcore furries dip their toes in furryism in places like VRChat

[08:51:16] <katp32> I think preferably you'd just have one partition for each OS, and use whichever one you use more for general storage. won't work for storing executables obviously, but sharing executables with a windows system probably isn't a good idea anyways :P

[09:05:14] <deniska> katp32: you probably don't want to run something like gentoo on x86 devices one may have lying around :)

[09:07:02] <deniska> Last time I tried setting up distcc I didn't succeed
[09:07:09] <n4dir> in general gentoo worked ok for me, but on my bad hardware, it simply took to long to simply upgrade stuff
[09:07:39] <n4dir> I don't remember how long installation took, but days, like Blondie101010 said, sounds reasonable. For the basics, that is

[11:38:33] <rouji> if your commercial vpn messes with dns, get rid of it immediately
[11:38:35] <DLange> oops: the likely reason is your commercial VPN hides as foreign dial-up users. Your own VPN server is in a netblock from OVH, DO, AWS or whatever you use. So some sites are more agressively checking for real user traffic from such IP ranges.
[11:38:58] <rouji> also DoH and stuff
[11:39:07] <katp32> rouji: no? DNS-based adblocking is quite common
[11:39:19] <rouji> if it does so without telling you

[11:40:08] <rouji> if I want my dns messed with, I'll do it myself thanks
[11:40:26] <katp32> but typically it's not even a "we're automatically intercepting and rewriting your traffic" thing, but rather a "our VPN client sets your computer's DNS resolver to our resolver" thing, which you can obviously easily configure

[16:49:59] <jim> relipse, so the first digit, takes (rwx), and the numbers are (421), you just add em together: 4 + 2 + 1 = 7, and same for the second digit... the third digit, (--x) and (421), only the 1 is there, so you get 771

Is there something I should check on the server?

[20:34:33] <kveroneau> Yes, actually it can.  It uses it's own CLI command of course, but I guess you could just create a wrapper script or shell alias called "sudo".

[20:37:55] <ayecee> R13ose: policykit
[20:37:57] <kveroneau> And some distros that pre-install sudo go the "NOPASSWD" route as well, making it even worse.
[20:38:32] <Dr_Coke> kveroneau what distro offers no password
[20:38:35] <kveroneau> So, if you say use a browser with a zero-day which can say execute command-line programs, and that site manages to say run "sudo", then well... you get it.
[20:39:09] <R13ose> Let's push Ubuntu to use policykit.
[20:39:13] <ayecee> it does
[20:39:52] <ayecee> if you've ever seen a dialog that said "this program requires superuser privileges, click here to proceed", or something to that effect, that was from policykit.
[20:39:57] <kveroneau> Dr_Coke, I recall earlier versions of Ubuntu doing this.  This isn't done anymore, but I could expect some users who dislike having to enter their password over and over, the type of users who hated UAC on Vista come to mind, would find out about NOPASSWD and enable it.

[20:40:18] <Dagmar> Ubuntu is not the reason for sudo's popularity
[20:40:33] <Dagmar> That's about as reasonable as saying Facebook is the cause of the popularity of cell phones.
[20:40:36] <R13ose> I'm confused Ubuntu uses both simultaneously?
[20:40:47] <ayecee> R13ose: yes
[20:41:02] <Dr_Coke> kveroneau: lol I was once one of those users until I realised how important having a password is
[20:41:07] <Dagmar> R13ose: It does not.  Sudo is a tool.  Polkit is more of a mechanism.  They perform _slightly_ different roles and tasks.
[20:41:09] <n4dir> at least back then at the debian forum usage of sudo was very uncommon, and mainly mentioned by ubuntu users.

[23:54:45] <Hash> I am trying to write a server clone script, backup important dir and compress them and restore on another freshly installed server on another provider. I want to be able to fire two commands, one for backup, one for restore, on old and new server, to easily clone everything. So far I've got all the configs from etc, var and other stuff.

[23:55:56] <ayecee> there's no way to do that reliably in an application-agnostic way. you'd need to consider the services that are running and their unique backup and restore requirements.

[23:57:36] <Hash> Nah.
[23:57:46] <kveroneau> Personally, I'd recommend just using a CM tool like Puppet, and store the package lists, and the configuration files on a central repo, so you can spin up instances really quickly with the same software configurations.  Once I went CM, it's really difficult to go back to the manual way of managing servers tbh

[23:57:54] <Hash> I'll show it in a sec, hang
[23:57:55] <ayecee> downside is that it produces a clone on restore, with the same crypto keys, the same identifiers, and can cause hell if the old one is still running
[23:58:08] <Hash> I'll show it in a second hang on
