[02:09:31] * NoobAlice congratulates kj7rrv
[02:09:40] <nobodies> essentially the dirs with those permissions used to be in my home dir, and I'm sure that's why i'd set the permissions like that in the first place, so both me and my media server user could read/write to them, but now i've moved them elsewhere and it is now causing issues setting the time when i run rsync. i don't think i actually need any special
[02:09:41] <nobodies> permissions set anymore, but just wanted to understand what its doing and whether that would cause problems setting the time

Whereas with GNU/Linux, the community documentation is vastly superior, and getting in contact with the developers (if I can't figure it out any other way) is actually possible. For Enterprise and business solutions, yeah, paid support is going to matter. But for the home deskt
[08:45:53] <kranos86> op user? GNU/Linux support beats the pants off Microsoft.
[08:46:43] <thurstylark> it's still a pretty high barrier to entry when android and windows are taking swings in the same spaces

[09:17:18] <Repentinus> Easy and Ubuntu just don't mesh in my mind.
[09:17:25] <predicament> seriously?
[09:17:36] <Repentinus> I want up-to-date software and as soon as you want that, stable Ubuntu is anything but easy.
[09:17:43] <predicament> i'm gonna let you explain this :P
[09:17:48] * thurstylark got his start with linux when his dad set up the family computer to dual boot fedora for the funzies
[09:18:17] <predicament> my linux start was redhat, but i didnt use it for long.. so.. i dont really count that.
[09:18:43] <Repentinus> If you want to use the latest stable releases of development tools like Python and GCC, you will end up enabling random ppa-s that will shit all over your system.
[09:18:54] <predicament> if you use apt
[09:18:57] <predicament> yes
[09:18:59] <thurstylark> ubuntu is easy if you color inside their lines, but that's too narrow of a path for people who usually land here

[09:19:20] <predicament> that makes sense
[09:19:22] <predicament> i like that
[09:19:39] <predicament> if you wanna get creative then arch is not a bad start
[09:19:58] <predicament> or even if you want somethin' stable
[09:20:10] <Repentinus> To me it seems that if you want up-to-date software it is either Arch or Fedora.
[09:20:11] <thurstylark> I literally got tired of trying to customize ubuntu in the ways that I wanted, so jumped to arch :P
[09:20:12] <predicament> for me anyway, its the most stable linux distro i've ever used
[09:20:46] <predicament> i jumped to manjaro and then after that, arch, and it was only cause no other OS would boot.. dual gpu wasn't really supported natively
[09:20:51] <Repentinus> Arch and Gentoo were pretty close for me, but I got tired of using the computer as a space heater.
[09:21:09] <predicament> i heard gentoo's install was long and crazy and shit
[09:21:17] <predicament> i dont know, thats one i havent used
[09:21:24] <alefir> I tried it once
[09:21:38] <alefir> it's the meme about arch being hard to install, but you also have to compile all the packages yourself
[09:21:49] <predicament> ^ compilation is what takes awhile
[09:22:02] <thurstylark> psh, it only takes 3 commands to install gentoo http://www.bash.org/?464385

[09:22:56] <midnite> when do they approve new bash.org quotes? seems like once every 10 years
[09:23:00] <Repentinus> Gentoo without large packages like Firefox or LibreOffice ain't that bad to compile, but you better have a good understanding of the hardware in your system, so you do not end up compiling the kernel several times just to get all the devices working.
[09:23:10] <predicament> well i dont even know if it's maintained now (bash)
[09:23:29] <midnite> I don't get why anyone would use gentoo

[09:24:21] <thurstylark> gentoo makes a lot of sense for security research (read: putting linux on things that weren't meant to run linux)
[09:24:42] <thurstylark> compiling exactly what you need can go a long way to satisfying tight space reqs
[09:24:43] <Repentinus> midnite, Gentoo would be fine if you had thousands of identical computers, so optimizing everything for your hardware actually makes sense.
[09:24:50] <midnite> I guess, yeah
[09:24:54] <midnite> Good point
[09:25:04] <Repentinus> It is also good for all sorts of exotic stuff that is not supported by any common distro too.
[09:25:29] <Repentinus> You can of course go with buildroot or LFS too, but at that point it just becomes a matter of preference.
[09:25:42] <thurstylark> yeah. It's got a role to play in the community, just not on my daily driver :P

[09:26:38] <predicament> i could be wrong
[09:26:56] <Repentinus> Sure, but good luck putting Ubuntu on a MIPS router.
[09:27:11] <Repentinus> You probably could do that with Gentoo.
[09:27:18] <predicament> oh yeah
[09:27:20] <predicament> easily
[09:27:28] <predicament> not ubuntu.
[09:27:43] <Repentinus> Easily is likely a stretch as you'd probably want to cross-compile, but you could do it.
[09:28:11] <predicament> well yeah, fine, a stretch lol but it can be done.
[09:28:47] <thurstylark> on a desktop, sure, mostly preference, but I wouldn't prefer to run OpenWRT on it, for example
[09:28:50] <thurstylark> same goes the other way
[09:29:15] <predicament> pointless unless it's a desktop+server that you do?   idk.

[11:16:57] <predicament> i don't know, it helped to run manjaro.. familiarity with aur helpers and the package manager is no different, as its arch based.. and i realized that it isnt that difficult.
[11:18:03] <thingfish> that's the one good thing about manjaro: it funnels people over to Arch, often enough.
