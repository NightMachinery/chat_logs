[00:06:16] <Batzy> can docker-compose replace a Dockerfile or do they need to work in conjunction?
[00:06:35] <tabakhase> compose just stores docker-commands you can think, so still need that
[00:07:05] <tabakhase> (hence the build: dockerfile:/context: section and "dockr-compose build" ;-)
[00:08:23] *** Joins: JoelJoel (~jjshoe@user/joel)
[00:09:27] <tabakhase> Batzy and on the tunnel thing - youd run a container with autossh and let the web container connect to that or so -- but you could tunnel on the host as well or in various layers "closer" to the webthing (sidecar, or even multiprocess) - first is the "dockerishest" 
[00:10:11] <Batzy> docker is beyond confusing
[00:10:13] <Batzy> ok i guess ill
[00:10:17] <Batzy> look into all that stuff
[00:10:18] <tabakhase> confusing - very much, no learning curve in docker ;-) keep headbutting it a bit and things will just fall in place rather quickly
[00:10:29] <tabakhase> a series of steps, rather than a curve ;-)
[00:10:35] <Batzy> "no learning curve in docker"?
[00:10:38] <Batzy> oh
[00:10:42] *** JoelJoel is now known as Joel
[00:10:56] <Batzy> i think i want to tunnel from docker
[00:11:07] <Batzy> i can just have a `RUN ssh ...` in my docker-compose?
[00:11:10] <Batzy> cant*
[00:11:37] <tang^> I've seen configurations that set up a vpn container in docker for other containers to use
[00:12:13] <tabakhase> in the end its like 5 commands with 10 arguments to remember that will do 99% of the work - but its rly a bit of a "you need to learn about all before doing even 1%, cant start with the first two only"
[00:13:40] <tabakhase> RUN ssh smells wrong - RUN = dockerfile = build --- you want a running container, could use one with "autossh" - or even just a plain ssh container for the start, and just overwrite the command: - so if you "can get away without building a image at all" its nice :P
[00:14:10] <Batzy> i would need
[00:14:18] <Batzy> a separate container tho
[00:14:22] <Batzy> and then somehow the other containers
[00:14:24] <Batzy> would need to use it
[00:14:25] <Batzy> ok
[00:15:01] <tabakhase> check for example https://hub.docker.com/r/jnovack/autossh

[00:16:16] <tabakhase> making the other container use that is as simple as having them in a network (what compose already does for you) and calling another by name :P  - so your dbhost may become "tunnel:3306" or such, hops to the other container, that sends you away by ssh
[00:16:55] <Batzy> hm
[00:17:15] <Batzy> too much to do
[00:17:17] <Batzy> haha
[00:17:23] <Batzy> i guess i can try it out
[00:17:36] <Batzy> so i need to have a container for ssh, another for nginx, another for python/mydjango app
[00:18:26] <tabakhase> (if the target is in "another compose file" - consider a) compose can merge files based on usecase, "docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.tunnel.yml up" b) a also works as "docker-compose.override.yml" to gitignore c) if its "another compose file entirely" you can still stick em in one network by giving it a fixed name: and declaring external: true on "one side"
[00:18:48] <tabakhase> Batzy > so i need to <... absolutely correct
[00:19:30] <tabakhase> "need" makes this sound so bad tho :P -- its the other way around in dockerland - its GREAT that you can use own containers for them all :P
[00:20:17] *** Parts: IOhannes (~zmoelnig@mechanica.at) ()
[00:20:34] <tabakhase> as all of those have wonderfull images on the hub, the only "build" youll have todo would be putting your code into the django upstream ((and for development, you can even hot-wire it with a bindmount given its python))

[01:05:55] <ada_> pycurious: you could use "docker volume prune" and it would delete and volumes not being used by containers at that moment;  if you're OK with deleting all those volumes then go ahead.  
[01:06:23] <ada_> pycurious: you might delete them by name, if you have a particular naming convention that you use, by filtering that list with docker volume ls --filter

[04:08:44] <cheesemid> in your docker-compose youre not building the nginx folder
[04:08:54] <cheesemid> which might mean that youre not overriding the default config
[04:09:06] <Batzy> i just added then, and i am overriding default config
[04:09:08] <Batzy> that*
[04:09:15] <Batzy> in volumes I have "./nginx:/etc/nginx/conf.d"
[04:09:26] <Batzy> ./nginx is where my default.conf lives
[04:10:44] <cheesemid> hmmm

[04:12:51] <Batzy> yeah i can see my conf file

[04:12:59] <Batzy> ive tried names both default.conf and nginx.conf
[04:14:06] <Batzy> i guess it's the actual conf then?
[04:17:20] <cheesemid> i think so
[04:17:26] <cheesemid> i might have found another lead
[04:17:45] <cheesemid> im reading up on the "listen" directive in nginx conf
[04:18:12] <cheesemid> if "listen" is not present then it relies on the "address" directive
[04:18:24] <cheesemid> and if theres no "address"
[04:18:38] <cheesemid> it says this
[04:18:39] <cheesemid> If the directive is not present then either *:80 is used if nginx runs with the superuser privileges, or *:8000 otherwise. 
[04:19:28] <cheesemid> maybe theres some funky networking business going on
[04:19:56] <cheesemid> try adding "listen 80;" at the top of the server block in the conf

[05:27:09] <cheesemid> the ssh portforwarding is only availible to the host machine not to containers
[05:27:31] <cheesemid> addind the extra host sections to docker compose will allow the container to access services on your host machine
[05:27:42] <Batzy> what exactly am i putting in here
[05:27:53] <cheesemid> so inside the container you will be able to find the db at host.docker.internal:3306

[05:39:54] <tabakhase> well extra_hosts: does nothing ehre (its "just /etc/hosts records") -- "host.docker.internal" is some special sauce only some docker versions have (namely, docker-for-mac) - but i think docker 20.x may have generalized this...
[05:40:22] <Batzy> ok
[05:40:25] <Batzy> how do i do this then
[05:40:37] <tabakhase> anyhow, only good method is "let user provide it" - so if you look at your host, youll have some 172.... ip on the "docker0" interface - thats what you wanne use

[05:41:19] <tabakhase> (your ssh tunnel on the host obvs also has to be bound on the 172 or 0.0.0.0 to be reachable, cant be localhost)
[05:41:44] <Batzy> what
[05:42:20] <Batzy> tabakhase docker has endlessly been fucking me for a few hours now
[05:42:22] <Batzy> so 
[05:42:23] <tabakhase> there is a LAN inbetween your host and containers - just no cables, but technically your PC is a router, docker0 is a switch, and everything hangs on that

[05:42:41] <Batzy> is going to have to figure all this out

[05:44:00] <tabakhase> figure "what" out? the adress to toss in there? -- a "lookup the gateway (using ip commands) and use that if the user didnt provide" is fairly accepted pattern
[05:44:22] <Batzy> well
[05:44:23] <tabakhase> or you can dockerize that tunnel as well - as i had posted some hours ago - then user just need to ship in credentials or so
[05:44:26] <Batzy> throwing in the ip

[05:55:31] <tabakhase> Batzy mostly, once you define any networks, compose doesnt ship with one for free anymore - so you can either remove that (and have nginx & autossh in same) or if you need those seperate, add another network to span appp&db-tunnel --- db-tunnel also likely doesnt need a ports: - containers within another can access all ports, so thats "only for you" (and then should be 127.0.0.1:3306:3306 :P)
[05:55:49] <tabakhase> but then that combined with telling your app "db is at db-tunnel:3306" should do just fine yep
[05:56:05] <Batzy> idk what to do about the networks
[05:56:09] <Batzy> i added that because i had to for nginx
[05:57:12] <Batzy> "Unknown MySQL server host 'autossh' (-2)")
[05:57:13] <Batzy> nice
[05:57:20] <tabakhase> "had to" seems wrong -- unless you maybe didnt have a version: in your file at that point?   (((super old files dont get a network, anything >=2.0 gets a network "for free", but only if you didnt specify any yourself)
[05:57:41] <Batzy> ok do u want to tell me how to adjust it
[05:57:44] <Batzy> because the whole nginx thing
[05:57:46] <Batzy> also took hours
[05:57:51] <Batzy> and that was the only thing that worked
[05:58:35] <tabakhase> remove all 3 networks: blocks (services as well as the bottom one)
[05:58:51] <Batzy> ok
[05:58:56] <Batzy> i commented it out
[05:59:02] <Batzy> let's  see how badly this breaks
[05:59:13] <tabakhase> if you maybe left a empty networks: or such on the bottom that could have screwed you over...
[05:59:29] <Batzy> oh hey it still works i think
[05:59:36] <Batzy> but autossh is just immediately exiting

[06:00:35] <Batzy> OH WAIT
[06:00:39] <Batzy> does autossh container have to run

[06:30:50] <Batzy> (2002, "Can't connect to MySQL server on '0.0.0.0' (115)") still getting this bad boy
[06:30:53] <Batzy> 0.0.0.0 is my bind ip
[06:31:10] <Batzy> it is printing the output from my ssh server though
[06:31:13] <Batzy> so it's definitely going
[06:32:45] <Batzy> https://bpa.st/QE4Q
[06:32:48] <Batzy> idk what to make of this
[06:33:18] <Batzy> ps -A u x looks right
[06:34:25] <Batzy> hmmm
[06:34:40] <Batzy> tabakhase any ideas riddle man
[06:35:51] <tabakhase> 0.0.0.0 has nothing todo with where django shall connect too
[06:36:16] <tabakhase> that last netstat looks pretty good indeed
[06:36:30] <Batzy> oh then what do i tell django
[06:36:45] <tabakhase> autossh:3306
[06:36:57] <Batzy> ok
[06:37:14] <Batzy> it works
[06:37:18] <Batzy> how did u know that from the netstat
[06:37:29] <Batzy> nvm
[06:37:44] <Batzy> you wouldnt happen to know how to get uwsgi and django to reload on code edits would you
[06:38:48] <tabakhase> yep line 5^^ - there it would also show up if you had not set bind_ip or so --- fairly common docker error, usual software is supposed to be local only these days cause secure-defaults and all that :D | docker kinda nudges that, there it breaks everything :D
[06:39:17] <Batzy> u seem insane enough to actually have learned docker
[06:39:20] <Batzy> that's a compliment
[06:39:36] <tabakhase> i had to :( - :D :D
[06:39:46] <tabakhase> you aint wrong tho...

[06:43:54] <Batzy> what do u code in usually
[06:44:59] <tabakhase> on the hot-reload topic - no real clue... with the bind-mount you should be like half the way there, prob some extra flag to set or such to have it watch-files/devmode or so...
[06:45:17] <Batzy> yeah well
[06:45:23] <Batzy> youve done enough for me today
[06:45:26] <Batzy> this was a big help
[06:45:26] <Batzy> ty
[06:45:53] <tabakhase> bit of everything... these days more ops/admin so code just little ugly things for internal tooling and then in whatever random language is the flavor of the day :D
[06:47:58] <sed> Anyone know how I can fix this? https://dpaste.org/CAn0#L7,19
[06:48:56] <tabakhase> sed `docker version` client&server? youre like the third person with strange multistage issues in the last few days... o.O
[06:49:28] <sed> i am on localhost debian personal pc
[06:49:45] <sed> Version:           20.10.5
[06:49:51] <tabakhase> as random idea, remove the name and try "--from=0"
[06:50:20] <sed> ok but the build will take at least 10 minutes
[06:50:38] <tabakhase> sure no worries
[06:50:54] <sed> all i did too was rm -rf /var/lib/docker/overlay2/*
[06:51:00] <sed> to save space each time
[06:51:04] *** Quits: realies (~realies@user/realies) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[06:51:12] <sed> deelete the images and stuff too with the docker commands before i build
[06:51:21] <sed> ran docker service restart
[06:51:41] <sed> i also installed kubernetes if that has anything to do with it
[06:51:48] <tabakhase> well :D what do you expect to have happened then - use dockers commands to cleanup, youll have a stash of json files hanging around somewhere referencing those things
[06:51:52] <sed> but i can't use kubernetes until i get the image built
[06:52:09] <tabakhase> so ya kinda pulled your buildcache away under its feet?
[06:52:28] <sed> should i just run a docker command to delete everything - images, volumes, networks, etc?
[06:52:45] <sed> but the kubernetes stuff will get deleted too

[06:52:59] <tabakhase> "docker system prune" (and various subcommands) - things that are "actually in use" will remain
[06:53:28] <sed> https://dpaste.org/Af1M
[06:53:30] <tabakhase> but yea, manually fingering around in /var/lib/docker asks for trouble :D
[06:53:47] <sed> Can I run delete even when i have these?
[06:54:11] <sed> i had no choice my pc is running out of space
[06:54:54] <tabakhase> see https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/#examples
[06:54:58] <sed> maybe should i completely uninstall and reinstall docker?
[06:55:07] <tabakhase> also "docker system df" to get an idea what it may do
[06:55:22] <tabakhase> sadly there is still no --dry-run on prune :/
[06:56:04] *** Joins: sebastianos (~sebastian@user/sebastianos)
[06:56:13] <sed> for that df command it says i have -16B for containers
[06:57:51] <sed> also any tips on how i could make the build faster? Stackoverflow seems to say .dockerignore but idk what to put in there
[06:58:56] <tabakhase> reinstall and full cleanup may be the smartest... or thats gonna mess with you forever -- make sure to pull out stuff you need to keep before that - if it still exists :/
[06:59:19] <sed> yea i guess i will do that sigh
[06:59:44] <sed> for all the trouble docker and kubernetes causes maybe i should just deploy non-containerized...
[06:59:54] <tabakhase> faster build -> dockerfile and if possible build-log-output on a nopaste? there are quite a few low-hanging-fruits and common fixes also documented on https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/
[07:00:29] <sed> you want to see my build output?
[07:01:19] <tabakhase> .dockerignore itself is a bit like .gitignore - and is used "when you do a build and your docker-cli packs up the context into a zip to send it over to the docker-daemon" --- so if you have a "logs/" dir with 50gb of .log files you may spend half an hour zipping -- while never actually COPY/ADD ing those files to your image in the end
[07:02:19] <tabakhase> also good for stuff where you want to "make sure it never ends up in the container" - like a vendor/ node_modules/ or such dirs

[18:47:08] <programmerq> supsup as long as you are using a bind mount, you should be good. The bind mount goes by the file's inode, so if you make changes on the host that swaps over to a new inode, the change won't be seen. vim does this, for example.
[18:47:25] <programmerq> but if you bind mount the whole directory instead of a single file, that shouldn't be an issue.

[19:47:08] <s0ullight> could someone briefly summarize how one can run a java app (jar file) in a docker container?
[19:47:35] <gordonjcp> Lutin: how so?
[19:47:58] <gordonjcp> Lutin: and, how does that differ from the current setup?

[23:56:32] <ada_> dman777: "show your work"
[23:56:46] <ada_> dman777: maybe you just did something wrong?  we'd need to see what you did to check
