[02:52:08] <bpalmer> ajarara: there is some threading support in emacs, but little uses it. Instead, often asynchronous work is done via separate processes; there are even things like async.el which use a subordinate emacs as the subprocess to do the work

[02:54:09] <ajarara> it's very wacky: ripgrep provides a preprocess step, and I'd like to write that preprocess step in emacs lisp instead of shell
[02:54:42] <bpalmer> preprocess? So it's not processing the output of ripgrep, but the input?
[02:55:09] <ajarara> yeah so that ripgrep searches over whatever is sent to stdout
[02:55:47] <bpalmer> I see. Well, you can also just run an emacs in --batch mode so that (print "whatever") is output from the batch script
[02:56:03] <bpalmer> e.g.,  emacs --batch -l my-filter.el
[02:56:36] <ajarara> ah yep, that'd work. It'd be 2 processes instead of 1 per input, but speed isn't that important
[02:56:44] <bpalmer> I'm not absolutely certain how that works as a command line filter, so some experimentation is in order (or I'm sure other people have played with it)
