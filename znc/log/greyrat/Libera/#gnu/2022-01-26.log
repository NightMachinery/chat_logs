[09:00:25] <epony> you suck
[09:00:35] <epony> BSD is free and predates GNU
[09:01:30] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSRG
[09:02:22] <epony> Professor Bob Fabry of Berkeley acquired a UNIX source license from AT&T in 1974. His group started to modify UNIX, and distributed their version as the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD).
[09:02:35] <epony> By the early 1980s, CSRG was the best-known non-commercial Unix developer, and a majority of Unix sites used at least some Berkeley software.
[09:03:17] <epony> The group was disbanded in 1995, leaving a significant legacy: FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and DragonFly BSD are based on the 4.4BSD-Lite distribution and continue to play an important role in the open-source UNIX community today, including dictating the style of C programming used via KNF in the style man page.

[09:07:25] <rindolf> epony: bsd wasn't libre when GNU started
[09:07:37] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license#OpenBSD_license
[09:07:59] <epony> it always was ;-)
[09:08:40] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_license
[09:12:37] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License#License_terms
[09:13:22] <epony> "As of 2020, the MIT License was the most popular software license found in one analysis,[12] continuing from reports in 2015 that the MIT License was the most popular software license on GitHub, ahead of any GNU GPL variant and other free and open-source software (FOSS) licenses.[13]"
[09:14:46] <epony> public domain > permissive licenses >>> protective licenses > gratis > commercial > classified
[09:16:41] <epony> precisely because it was Free the commercial monopolist AT&T sued and held back Free UNIX by 5 years so non-free Linux and GNU get the Internet support instead of the truelly free BSD and permissive free licensed software
[09:17:32] <epony> some years later, permissive licensed software is the norm for free software, despite the license cranking and aggressive propagating effects of the protective and enforcing licenses
[09:18:12] <epony> commerce sponsors less free software that is less likely to compete with them
[09:19:03] <epony> so that's Linux gets the drivers and signs the NDAs and gets big money from corporations and code droppings and implants and major inserts and manipulations and control by sponsoring big business
[09:19:37] <epony> Linux is GNU licensed which is less free and more compelling and less likely to be competing with the big businesses
[09:19:47] <epony> so get your stories fixed
[09:20:23] <epony> the funny parts now:
[09:21:41] <epony> big business use BSD internally and for their business backends, and only use GNU and Linux externally and for their consumer offerings to the public as a last resort when they can't get off by commercial and secretive software
[09:22:36] <epony> that is, they use the more free and superior quality industrial grade software for themselves, and push out the inferior quality less free and consumer variants for their customers and useds
[09:23:08] <epony> if they even release anything, most of the time they just provide forced services and free access commercial produce (trialware)
[09:24:16] <epony> there is really no conflict between BSD and GNU licensing models, the real concerns are quality of the software and its reliability and internet use safety
[09:25:15] <epony> GNU is a follower of UNIX after the BSD model, just took a couple of different decisions and claimed superior freedoms which is a lie
[09:25:56] <GoatAvenger> GNU is Not Unix
[09:26:25] <epony> there is a paramount difference between the licenses "verbiage", "model" and "software quality".. and feature wise GNU offers a lot more, which is exposure to failure and it really gets nailed on the internet for security faults
[09:26:49] <epony> businesses are unforgiving, unlike dull consumers
[09:28:50] <epony> naively expecting that stronger claims on freedoms and publicity and consumer markets grab will result in higher industry adoption, standardisation control and reliability and quality is.. fiction
[09:30:46] <epony> all software has defects and faults, just excess software spillage for the sake of more features and verbosity is overengineering, which is generally a good thing for consumers, but a bad thing for reliability and dependability (reusability / componentisation / modularity)
[09:31:01] *** Quits: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c) (Quit: :P)
[09:31:24] <epony> also, these are pretty useless debates about licensing
[09:32:03] <epony> the really useful ones are about "conventions" and "benefits and qualities" where each of these shine and have more applicability
[09:32:34] <epony> they are both important and needed by people both amateur and professionals alike
[09:33:10] <epony> what businesses decide is not that relevant, they are mostly commercial re-implementers of academic and public sectors innovation
[09:33:52] <klys> int gnu = getopt_long( argc, argv, "x:y" );
[09:34:29] <epony> 45-50 years of modern computing, software has always been free and will remain free, that's how academic and scientific systems work
[09:35:18] <epony> whether it's freely accessible to end users and re-implementers, is thereafter the choice of the implementeres group to decide in a pooling resources model
[09:35:31] <epony> smaller groups pick one model, larger groups pick another model
[09:35:38] <epony> nothing that special about these details
[09:37:02] <epony> BSD is UNIX, GNU is UNIX and Linux is UNIX.. also commercial systems are adaptations of some sort of UNIX in primitive and intentionally non-standard and non-compatible ways
[09:37:36] <epony> common ancestry, different downstream "choices" for the sake of own goals fulfillment
[09:38:50] <epony> standards are the only thing that matters, and compatibility and interoperability, and engineering principles of modularity and reuse, and open access for participation and sustainable independent re-implementation without restrictions
[09:40:13] <epony> there is NOTHING secret about software and programming, it's not very special and is simply reuse of common principles and methodologies, pooling of resources and no more than a couple of choices in each "element" of the entire system (layered model)
[09:40:30] <klys> tell your kid that
[09:41:31] <epony> GNU people need to know these details much more than any other group of UNIX re-implementers.
[09:42:27] <epony> there is an educational role of the major conventions of UNIX practitioners
[09:43:12] <epony> also teaching just one person is a start, but not nearly enough or satisfactory minimum
[09:43:52] <epony> so you educate your teachers so they tell it to ALL your kids
[09:44:27] <epony> there is a lot more to learn than being a "quick wits" ;-)

[20:26:49] <anton> for a self-hosted git web frontend, would gitweb, cgit, or something else be a good choice

[20:34:40] <bandali> anton, both gitweb and cgit would be fine choices. cgit is newer and probably more lightweight.
[20:35:26] <anton> thx

[20:35:42] <bandali> anton, cheers. other choices, static ones, include https://codemadness.org/stagit.html and https://depp.brause.cc/depp/
[20:36:42] <bandali> depends on your use-case, really. for savannah, we have both cgit and gitweb. for personal use-cases, static ones like stagit depp might do just fine
