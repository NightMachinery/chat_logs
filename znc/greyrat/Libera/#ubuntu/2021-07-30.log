[02:16:31] <Guest84> Hi. I have a Ubuntu Server 20.04, with unattended upgrades enabled. "apt list --upgradable" shows 95 upgradable packages. I notice all the upgradable packages are in focal-updates, then I saw in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades that the only allowed origins are focal and focal-security. (focal-updates commented out). Is this how I should
[02:16:31] <Guest84> keep my server configured, or do I enable focal-updates?
[02:17:03] <Guest84> This is a my personal VPS on the Internet. No production, but not hidden by a NAT either.
[02:17:28] <Guest84> Basically I'm wondering how other people configure their servers
[02:18:35] *** Joins: kenzie (~kenzie@ns510210.ip-192-99-14.net)
[02:19:37] <Guest84> Question 2: I see in apt installation log, eg /var/log/dpkg.log, that it installed "2021-07-21 06:49:47 install linux-image-5.4.0-80-generic:amd64 <none> 5.4.0-80.90". But "uname -a" shows I'm still on 5.4.0-72-generic. Do I need to reboot for these updates to apply?
[02:19:38] <tomreyn> Guest84: some prefer having no automated updates at all, many prefer automated security updates only (that's what you have now, and the default), and some are fine with automated security and bug fix updates.
[02:19:47] <tomreyn> and some would even agree with automatic reboots
[02:20:21] <tomreyn> yes, you would usually reboot to apply a kernel upgrade
[02:20:57] <Guest84> Is there a way I can make it reboot automatically for kernel upgrades?
[02:21:21] <tomreyn> yes, just properly read the file you already looked at
[02:21:25] <Guest84> oops, yeah

[05:41:14] <VIA> excellent :)
[05:41:36] <sarnold> X11 applications *really* aren't written with the assumption of multiple user accounts all working in one session
[05:42:30] <sarnold> the toolkits are huge and do a billion file operations all over the home directory, and it's just so easy for gui applications run through sudo or su or whatever to make a huge mess
[05:42:32] <VIA> what was the app named ppl suggested i hadn that seemed to be standard
[05:42:45] <VIA> seems my "filemanager" here is exo-open
[05:43:12] <sarnold> VIA: nautilus? this plugin? https://itsfoss.com/open-nautilus-as-administrator/
[05:43:19] <VIA> i have no ida what X11 is
[05:43:28] <sarnold> X11 is the default graphics environment

[05:43:46] <VIA> yea nautilus its not here. i generally prefer not to install additionall stuff, when i have already working stuff, and know it should work in a specified manner
[05:43:53] <sarnold> there's a newer thingy, wayland, that aims to replace X11
[05:44:34] <sarnold> but wayland is more complicated in some ways (the 'compositor' is built in to whatever 'window manager' and copy and paste and all kinds of other things are all implemented in the one tool
[05:44:51] <sarnold> and it's simpler in others, I think it refuses to let you run different programs as different users entirely

[15:47:26] <metallic> Hello everyone. I have a question on removing a desktop environment.    I am running Ubuntu 20.04 with KDE desktop environment (Kubuntu), and I want to switch to lxqt. I first thought of installing the lxqt tasksel task and deinstalling the KDE's, but I am unsure of the side effects of this procedure. Do you think it would be best to reinstall the OS with lxqt?

[15:48:58] <guiverc> metallic, you can also just install lubuntu on top of your existing kubuntu, then have both.. As they are both Qt5 the side effects will be minimal (I have a system with both installed; you select which you'll use for a session at login)
[15:49:17] <guiverc> `sudo apt install lubuntu-desktop` will get everything; what I was thinking with ^
[15:49:38] * guiverc did the reverse; adding kubuntu-desktop to my lubuntu install

[15:50:35] <oerheks> a clean install side by side gives the full experience. but sure, it can be installed on top.
[15:50:38] <metallic> guiverc: thanks for the answer. Yes, I know I can have multiple desktop environments, but I no longer want to use plasma 5, so I am fearful that uninstalling it will take some applications along
[15:50:51] <oerheks> adding a desktop is no problem, removing one is interesting.

[15:51:44] <guiverc> uninstalling kubuntu-desktop will cause all non-manually installed apps to be marked for removal... but it's the alternative; ie. remove then install lubuntu-desktop for everything..

[15:52:16] <guiverc> (packages auto-installed by desktop will be removed when you next `apt autoremove`)
[15:52:27] <oerheks> booting the iso, replacing, would be an option too
[15:52:29] <metallic> mmmm that is exactly what I was thinking of: uninstallation will remove all the dependencies :(
[15:52:58] <guiverc> those used by Lubuntu/LXQt will be kept (or re-installed if you autoremove before you do the install)..
[15:53:59] * guiverc wispers; I like some Kubuntu features; eg. it has great tools to select new themes for sddm; Lubuntu doesn't.. so I like both installed

[15:57:20] <guiverc> I use LXQt almost exclusively myself (maybe being on Lubuntu team is part of why)... but other than disk space used, & larger updates (both kubuntu & lubuntu packages will be upgraded) the effect is minimal ; this pc is a 2009 dell
[15:58:10] <guiverc> KDE uses Qt5 (same as LXQt) but also KF5 so yes it's heavier; but the KF5 will only be used when/if you use KDE apps  (which at times you may still anyway)
[15:58:23] *** chewbury_ is now known as chewbury
[15:59:19] <metallic> You sure are right, but I feel it lighter with lxqt than with KDE :/
[16:00:04] <metallic> I think I am going to try them both together for some weeks, and then make up my mind on whether or not remove one of them. Thanks for the advice :) guiverc oerheks

[17:27:08] <rbasak> Guest14: what kpcyrd is right. I'd add that I think the list of known SSIDs is configured/known/managed in NetworkManager on a regular Ubuntu desktop install, so that's where you'd need to look.

[17:28:11] <rbasak> IOW I don't think that configured but not connected SSIDs could possibly be broadcast without NetworkManager's help, since that's the only component that knows what they are.

[19:24:24] <epistax> Heya, I recently got Ubuntu on a work desktop. I want to be able to start a session while I'm at work, and then continue it remotely (from windows). I have xrdp / tightvncserver, what I'm not sure about is how to host a vnc session from the existing x session. Is anyone aware of a complete guide on how to set this up? Thx

[19:25:46] <donofrio> epistax, are you tunneling that vnc session though ssh?
[19:26:39] <epistax> donofrio, I think it's tunneled through rdp. I rdp into a session that'll let me connect to vnc-any, but I don't know how to make a vnc session for the existing X session

[23:25:27] <VimVim> thx (≧◡≦)
[23:25:45] <VimVim> So uh.... I'm having some problems with authbind . I'm running my aiohttp server with it and it's not working properly?
[23:26:03] <VimVim> (webserver)
[23:26:06] <VimVim> my command is "sudo authbing python3 host.py"
[23:26:16] <VimVim> *authbind
[23:26:23] <VimVim> I made a test. Every time the homepage is visited it tries to touch (command) a file in the root directory
[23:26:23] <VimVim> and it's works, nothing stops it.

[23:47:28] <alzgh> I'm on an Ubuntu focal. I ran a vpn-cli that messed up my network. It was my dns. I configured it using resolvectl and it works now. But on restart it goes back to the broken state of the vpn-cli. Where can I look for what the vpn tool did?

[23:58:26] <alzgh> sarnold is `nm-applet` specific to Gnome? Or let's say, can it be that it isn't active/available in KDE Plasma?
[23:58:45] <sarnold> alzgh: plasma probably has its own nm interface
[23:59:20] <alzgh> It's probably this, bc this vpn-cli works on Gnome but not on KDE Plasma.
