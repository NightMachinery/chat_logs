[19:10:15] <Guest8023> Hi y'all. I'm having trouble getting haskell-language-server to work with my XMonad config setup
[19:10:36] <Guest8023> But I'm also very new to Haskell.
[19:10:54] <Guest8023> I'm getting a Multi Cradle: No prefixes matched error
[19:11:09] <Guest8023> I think it's because my config file doesn't belong to any components.
[19:11:35] <Guest8023> But I don't understand how components work (I am using stack), and so I can't figure out how to get my config file to be parsed correctly
[19:22:18] <Guest8023> So, I guess, my question is, How do I make a component that only contains a single file at the root of my project directory?
[19:27:10] <fendor[m]> Guest8023: Hi! Do you have a stack.yaml / package.yaml / *.cabal file? HLS does currently not trivially work for single files without such a file
[19:27:22] <Guest8023> Yes, I do.
[19:27:28] <Guest8023> I did see that much in the docs.
[19:27:38] <Guest8023> I set it up like this: https://xmonad.org/TUTORIAL.html
[19:27:49] <Guest8023> The xmonad and xmonad-contrib repositories are subdirectories
[19:27:55] <Guest8023> Linked in with the stack.yaml
[19:28:02] <Guest8023> And then there's the xmonad.hs file
[19:28:12] <Guest8023> That's my config, and the only file I will really be editing.
[19:28:27] <Guest8023> That's in the root
[19:29:39] <Guest8023> I apologize if my terminology is confusing, I'm very new to Haskell, and am not familiar with the ins and outs of everything.
[19:32:42] <fendor[m]> you are doing great, dont worry about it. So, stack repl works in the root of your project?
[19:33:01] <fendor[m]> The command being `stack repl`
[19:33:23] <Guest8023> Yes.
[19:33:55] <fendor[m]> great... uhm, how about you add a simple `hie.yaml` file with the following contents `cradle: {stack: } `?
[19:34:10] <fendor[m]> You can run HLS on the cli via `haskell-language-server-wrapper --debug <some-path-to-a-file>`
[19:34:45] <Guest8023> The auto-generated hie mostly looks fine.
[19:34:56] <Guest8023> cradle:
[19:34:57] <Guest8023>   stack:
[19:34:57] <Guest8023>     - path: "xmonad/src"
[19:34:58] <Guest8023>       component: "xmonad:lib"
[19:34:58] <Guest8023>     - path: "xmonad/./Main.hs"
[19:34:59] <Guest8023>       component: "xmonad:exe:xmonad"
[19:34:59] <Guest8023>     - path: "xmonad/tests"
[19:35:00] <Guest8023>       component: "xmonad:test:properties"
[19:35:00] <Guest8023>     - path: "xmonad-contrib/./"
[19:35:01] <Guest8023>       component: "xmonad-contrib:lib"
[19:35:01] <Guest8023>     - path: "xmonad-contrib/tests"
[19:35:02] <Guest8023>       component: "xmonad-contrib:test:tests"
[19:35:02] <Guest8023>     - path: "xmonad-contrib/."
[19:35:03] <Guest8023>       component: "xmonad-contrib:test:tests"
[19:35:18] <Guest8023> I just can't figure out how to add a leaf for ./xmonad.hs
[19:36:08] <fendor[m]> we do have some explanation here: https://github.com/haskell/hie-bios#stack
[19:36:36] <Guest8023> Yeah, I did read that.
[19:37:04] <Guest8023> Although every time I try adding something, I stumble over an incorrect component or a non-existent project
[19:37:18] <Guest8023> I don't know how to add a project for a single file.
[19:37:24] <Guest8023> Or if that's even the right way to go.
[19:38:01] <fendor[m]> the xmonad.hs is in the root, you said? Can you share the contents of your package.yaml / *.cabal file?
[19:38:42] <Guest8023> With comments removed, stack.yaml:
[19:38:48] <Guest8023> resolver:
[19:38:48] <Guest8023>   url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commercialhaskell/stackage-snapshots/master/lts/19/0.yaml
[19:38:49] <Guest8023> packages:
[19:38:49] <Guest8023> - xmonad
[19:38:50] <Guest8023> - xmonad-contrib
[19:39:25] <Guest8023> I tried adding a package here, but I don't know how to create one for a particular file.
[19:39:31] <Guest8023> Was getting some really weird errors.
[19:40:35] <fendor[m]> you should use https://paste.tomsmeding.com/ for sharing files please 🙂
[19:40:47] <Guest8023> Oh. Sorry.
[19:41:13] <fendor[m]> dont worry
[19:41:55] <Guest8023> https://paste.tomsmeding.com/ESbvRApA
[19:42:08] <Guest8023> That's a pretty nice site.
[19:42:55] <fendor[m]> yeah it is 😀 
[19:44:03] <fendor[m]> and xmonad.hs is neither in xmonad nor in xmonad-contrib but in the root of the project?
[19:44:20] <Guest8023> Yes
[19:44:27] <Guest8023> Those are both subdirectories
[19:45:47] <fendor[m]> ok, yeah that's probably the issue, the xmonad.hs should ideally have its own package.yaml/*.cabal file
[19:47:48] <Guest8023> Alrighty, thanks. I'll see if I can write something like that.
