[03:18:40] <philipp64|work> I‚Äôve got a question about mTLS with libcurl.  If I run ‚Äúcurl‚Äù from the command-line with the server‚Äôs cert issuer cert in my --cacert file, the client cert file (PEM) via --cert, and the matching private key (PEM) via --key, that all works fine.  But in a C program doing the following, it fails.  Apache gives me a 403, seemingly because it fails to verify the client cert (commenting out ‚ÄúSSLVerifyClient require‚Äù makes everything work agai
[03:18:41] <philipp64|work> Apache also spews this on failure:

[10:41:46] <GodEater> is the number across the top the number of vulnerabilities in total?

[10:42:40] <GodEater> ah ok
