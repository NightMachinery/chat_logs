[20:40:04] <Nanobot> OTE short zone = price is "high" relative to the last major low. OTE long zone = price is "low" relative to the last major high. Buy low, sell high.
[20:40:34] <ButterNoodle> gotcha
[20:40:58] <Nanobot> If the price goes above the OTE short zone, that indicates that it's probably going to rise to new highs. If the price goes below the OTE long zone, that indicates that it's probably going to drop to new lows.
[20:41:40] <Nanobot> The zones are ranges. The price has just touched the bottom of the OTE short zone. The top of that range is $57128.

[20:43:12] <ButterNoodle> not that I want to pump any money into it.. and plan to hold what I have for a while
[20:44:03] <ButterNoodle> I dont think I will buy anymore unless something catastrophic happens that makes it drop below 10K again
[20:44:36] <ButterNoodle> but if we go beyond ATH +%20 or so, it'd be hard not to sell
[20:44:51] <Nanobot> My buying range is $27169 and below.
