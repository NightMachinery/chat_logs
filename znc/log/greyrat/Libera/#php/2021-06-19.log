[00:34:16] *** Joins: chrysanthematic (~chrysanth@user/chrysanthematic)
[00:43:17] <biberu> arash: php.net/array_filter
[01:07:32] <ordos> arash, well done on figuring it out for yourself. You've got everything it takes to be a great programmer. Feel free to stick around here to help others. When I first started programming in PHP, I joined this channel 20 years ago. And I still learn new things in this channel every day, just by reading the brilliant advice given by the others in here. Lurking in this channel has been a great time investment.
[01:09:26] <Blondie101010> would any of you know of a good way/tool to send messages to a syslog server without using the system logger (so ruling out the built-in syslog() function)?
[01:10:04] <ordos> Blondie101010, I'd start by examining syslog()'s source to determine how it writes to the syslog server.
[01:10:32] <arash> ordos, thank you for your advice
[01:10:52] <ordos> arash, you're welcome. Good luck on your PHP journey. And feel free to stick around!
[01:11:00] <Blondie101010> ordos:  I'll look but I doubt it will answer me as it calls the system logger
[01:11:47] <ordos> Blondie101010, good point - thanks for the tip, I misread your statement. I guess in that case I'd look at the system logger's source.
[01:11:55] <Blondie101010> :)
[01:11:58] <Blondie101010> funny guy
[01:12:00] <Blondie101010> thanks
[01:12:37] <arash> biberu, thank you, i should practice to findout a way to write a function for that
[01:12:51] <Sammitch> Blondie101010: like you want to send messages to a remote syslog server directly from PHP?
[01:12:52] <arash> Northwoods, kind of..
[01:13:04] <Blondie101010> Sammitch:  yes
[01:13:51] <ordos> Sammitch, good insight in that question. What gave you the idea the question was about sending messages remotely?
[01:14:10] <Blondie101010> that was my question
[01:14:18] <Sammitch> the whole
[01:14:23] <Northwoods> arash, nice , keep it up
[01:14:23] <Sammitch> the whole "send messages to a syslog server" bit
[01:14:31] <ordos> Blondie101010, yeah except there was no mention of remote. So I failed to recognise that that word was implied. Lack of experience I guess.
[01:14:41] <Northwoods> i am also learning

[01:14:51] <Northwoods> Blondie101010 knows about it
[01:15:12] <Sammitch> Blondie101010: I suppose you've already elminiated all options regarding not usiong syslog at all? :P
[01:15:21] <ordos> Blondie101010, put another way, I can write to my mysql server on a local machine. I (evidently incorrectly) assumed you were referring to writing to a local syslgog server
[01:16:05] <Blondie101010> ordos:  if it was local, I'd have to either use the system logger or just output to a file
[01:16:40] <Blondie101010> Sammitch:  I guess I'm open to alternatives if you have any for Splunk
[01:16:45] <ordos> Blondie101010, noted, thanks for the tip - I'm not too familiar with the system logger. I have team of devops guys that handles that. All that aside, I have a decent amount of experience with writing remote procedure calls using all sorts of protocols. If you're stuck on that aspect of it, specifically, then I might be able to assist.
[01:17:18] <Blondie101010> talking about many millions of messages per day
[01:17:26] <ordos> Blondie101010, so radio wave?
[01:17:49] <ordos> Sounds like a sensory input of sorts. Every how many seconds?
[01:18:25] <Blondie101010> it's not, but the idea (from my boss) is too stupid to mention :)
[01:19:28] <ordos> Blondie101010, I feel your pain mate :-) Yesterday I was in a meeting with Chinese battary+inverter pack suppliers, debating the rate at which we can store their garbage API's sensory output
[01:19:36] <ordos> *battery
[01:20:34] <Blondie101010> I can say that the problem with using the system logger is that it discards some messages when it gets overloaded :)
[01:20:37] <Sammitch> well Splunk's marketing team had a damned field day with their website, is there anywhere that actually lists what log/event formats they can ingest?
[01:21:17] <Blondie101010> (and no it's not because of UDP)
[01:21:35] * Sammitch stops typing udp
[01:22:06] <Blondie101010> it doesn't get lost, it gets discarded
[01:22:10] <nucc1> Blondie101010: doesn't your logging product of choice provide you a library or bindings?
[01:22:51] <Sammitch> my main beef with syslog is that the protocol is arcane and only handles a handful of possible log "facilities"
[01:23:53] <nucc1> Blondie101010: for example, splunk appears to want you to use a REST api for sending logs.
[01:24:31] <ordos> Blondie101010, how long is the average message? What RAM does the server use?
[01:24:36] <nucc1> if you are dealing with a high scale, i'd imagine you'd want to write your logs to some queue system, and then have processes that empty that queue to splunk
[01:24:56] <Blondie101010> RAM is not an issue... messages are regular logs so really short on average
[01:24:59] <ordos> nucc1, that's some Gang of Four stuff right there. Sage advice.
[01:25:26] <ordos> Blondie101010, ok just checking. RAM was once an issue for us at scale (long average message length).
[01:26:06] <Sammitch> looks like Fluentd has an output plugin for Splunk, and then you'll have the added benefit of having your fluentd collectors already set up for when your org sees the Splunk bill and goes "aw hell naw" https://github.com/fluent/fluent-plugin-splunk
[01:26:46] <Blondie101010> nucc1:  are you sure the Splunk rest API can be used to send messages?  it doesn't seem to be the case at first glance
[01:27:34] <Blondie101010> yeah, Splunk is very expensive
[01:27:58] <ordos> Guys please catch me up on Splunk
[01:28:34] <Sammitch> SaaS log aggregation thingy
[01:28:52] <ordos> Huh. Interesting name Splunk.
[01:29:10] <nucc1> Blondie101010: you're right. the API isn't for logging. https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/AdvancedDev/ModInputsLog
[01:29:34] <ordos> Sammitch, they should name their log analyser Spelunker.
[01:30:11] <ordos> Blondie101010, do you have physical access to the server? Or if it's virtual, have you tried it on different servers? Same issue?
[01:30:56] <Blondie101010> having physical access changes nothing
[01:33:00] <Sammitch> Blondie101010: IIRC from when I was attempting something similar, virtually all syslog things are going to follow the same workflow of going to the system's syslog with the expectation that if you want to forward messages to a remote syslog server you'll have configured that in the system's syslog settings. further to that, talking directly to a remote syslog server is a pain in the ass because they don't
[01:33:02] <Blondie101010> we only need physical access when there's a hardware failure
[01:33:06] <Sammitch> necessarily all agree on their implementations of the spec.
[01:33:28] * Blondie101010 nods
[01:34:51] <Sammitch> I think that I was tinkering with the syslog protocol when I finally gave up and started learning logstash [note: skip logstash and go straight to fluentd]
[01:35:25] <Sammitch> logstash uses obscene amounts of resources and performs like absolute trash
[01:35:26] <Blondie101010> logstash is good for receiving syslog messages, but I don't think it can send

[01:35:40] <ordos> Blondie101010, I once had an issue where data was being randomly discarded in a high throughput queue; turned out it was a RAM error. We were running cheap desktop servers at the time. We discovered ECC that day.
[01:35:56] <ordos> Anyhow, I was just eliminating possible causes to your problem :-)
[01:36:18] <Blondie101010> the problem is the idea, but I want to try to go beyond it
[01:36:45] <Blondie101010> the splunk server itself can take more
[01:37:35] <arash> biberu, i read array_filter document, i didn't find a way to pass an argument to the callback function so i can't do what i want. it seems it only take arrays value and key but if it is possible let me know
[01:38:04] <Blondie101010> arash:  what do you want to filter on?
[01:38:22] <ordos> Ok so we have many million relatively short messages per day being sent remotely to a syslog server and some of those messages are being discarded somewhere along the chain. Based on your responses to my previous question I'm working under the assumption that you've eliminated any potential network and / or hardware issues, and are instead trying to solve the software limitation that is the final step that's holding you back.

[01:43:52] <ordos> Blondie101010, "the messages are not sent" - do you have a hunch as to where the breakdown of communication takes place?
[01:43:54] <nucc1> Blondie101010: you're ruled out throttling?
[01:43:58] <Sammitch> or "X dduplicate messages suppressed"

[01:46:23] <arash> biberu, yes. i read it.
[01:46:23] <nucc1> unless you've ruled out throttling, it's probably throttling
[01:46:30] <ordos> Blondie101010, you oughta share your experience when you finally figure it out! I'd be fascinated.
[01:46:40] <Blondie101010> sure

[01:47:39] <Sammitch> just to be part of the peeing contest, my coillector only peaks at about 110 messages per second across all environments :P
[01:47:41] <nucc1> are the messages being sent to a remote machine?
[01:47:57] <Blondie101010> yes
[01:48:03] <nucc1> you probably answered that, over TCP right?
[01:48:06] <Blondie101010> the network can easily take it
[01:48:11] <Blondie101010> no, UDP
[01:48:18] <nucc1> well, i'd switch to TCP
[01:48:22] <Blondie101010> but I traced both sides to rule out a network problem
[01:48:25] <Blondie101010> it'd be slower

[01:48:57] *** Joins: arash (~arash@5.124.30.120)
[01:49:14] <nucc1> you can raise the throttle limit on your syslog configuration
[01:49:24] <nucc1> what's the underlying network like?
[01:49:35] <nucc1> lots of small udp packets can be easily dropped by NICs
[01:49:42] <nucc1> especially if you have QoS
[01:49:50] <Blondie101010> plenty of loose on the 10GB
[01:49:59] <Blondie101010> 10Gbps
[01:50:07] <nucc1> yes, tbe peak capacity can only really be achieved with large-ish packets
[01:50:25] <nucc1> any particular NIC can only handle so many packets per second
[01:50:45] <nucc1> and you probably have the default queue length on linux of 1000 packets (or is it bytes? )
[01:51:13] <nucc1> check NIC stats perhaps
[01:51:17] <Blondie101010> again, it's not a network issue
[01:51:32] <nucc1> ok, if you're confident.
[01:51:40] <Blondie101010> yes I proved it
[01:52:02] <Blondie101010> the messages that disappear are not sent
[01:52:38] <nucc1> with a capture on the generating host?
[01:52:42] <Blondie101010> yes
[01:52:59] <nucc1> then it's throttling... but this should leave obvious messages in the logs
[01:53:20] <Blondie101010> obvious when your log files are less than a GB maybe
[01:54:02] <nucc1> i dunno about this, but if you're logging remotely, won't the local syslog be smaller?
[01:54:15] <Blondie101010> it certainly is
[01:55:08] <Blondie101010> the server rarely doesn't ack messages...  that's something I looked at
[01:55:24] <nucc1> with UDP you don't expect Acks
[01:55:30] <Blondie101010> it does
[01:55:31] <ordos> nucc1, "lots of small udp packets can be easily dropped by NICs" - why is that?
[01:55:59] <nucc1> NIC can only transmit a fixed number of packets a second
[01:56:17] <nucc1> and it's easier to overrun the transmit buffer
[01:56:19] <Blondie101010> that's linear processing
[01:56:23] <ordos> Ah right. So my hunch that it may a hardware issue is not far from the through. I guess I should clarify - an embedded software issue.
[01:56:31] <Blondie101010> so even if you add 10 CPUs it won't do more
[01:56:36] <nucc1> it's always linear processing.
[01:56:55] <nucc1> they just use queues to do QOS and process from certain queues more often than others.
[01:57:14] <nucc1> at the physical layer, it's literally transmitting one packet at a time, pause, transmit next packet.
[01:57:14] <ordos> Never heard the term linear processing used in the context of a NIC's embedded software interface
[01:57:25] <Blondie101010> it's a concept
[01:57:47] <ordos> Blondie101010, let me rephrase. It is so obvious to a NIC's design that noone explicitly uses that term in the context of network interfaces.
[01:57:47] <Blondie101010> same as a switch
[01:58:03] <nucc1> switches can do it in parallel, hence their name
[01:58:10] <nucc1> but on any one interface, it's linear
[01:58:16] <nucc1> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpacket_gap
[01:59:02] <nucc1> e.g on a 10gbps NIC, every 9.6 nanoseconds, the NIC is transmitting nothing.
[01:59:21] <nucc1> that gives you a theoretical limit on how many packets can be transmitted in a second
[01:59:44] <nucc1> if you have lots of 100 byte packets, you're won't be near 10gbps before you run out of capacity
[01:59:53] <Blondie101010> indeed
[02:01:08] <nucc1> but you swear it's not the network
[02:01:32] <Blondie101010> I've been wrong on occasion, but I doubt it
[02:02:07] <nucc1> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/TFS4T6bM6T/
[02:02:21] <nucc1> if you're hitting network limits, you'll see drop counters rising.
[02:02:36] <nucc1> if it's QOS causing drops, you can see from QOS system's stats

[02:06:05] <nucc1> are you doing image/sound processing stuff?
[02:06:12] <nucc1> or is it wireless transmission?
[02:06:21] <ordos> nucc1, yeah something like that. I'm not entirely sure what they're doing exactly. I just know the battery farms have a 10-second cron job execute radio burst API calls

[02:06:55] <nucc1> hmmm energy monitoring then
[02:07:01] <nucc1> mesh networking perhaps.
[02:07:28] <nucc1> well, in wireless transmissions, you want to randomize transmit times
[02:07:31] <ordos> It's this factory in china that sends us battery+inverter kits. They're competing with Powerwall. Also Li-Ion
[02:07:37] <nucc1> otherwise, you just get a whole lot of collisions
[02:07:43] <nucc1> because the spectrum is shared
[02:08:20] <ordos> nucc1, yeah they have some algorithm that auto-configures each pack on boot and then recallibrate's the network's global settings to ensure minimal spectrum overlap
[02:08:51] <ordos> Don't ask me how that works I have no idea. I just need to know that it works.
[02:08:59] <ordos> These kids are 19.

[02:09:29] <nucc1> yea, last decade's Phd thesis is this decades grade school science project they say

[02:10:31] <ordos> every battery is a host, it's designed for maximum redundancy in the event of explosion / fire etc.
[02:11:14] <nucc1> yea, i can imagine what it's like. they do similar things in high availability network gear, but obviously usually just about 4 devices in a cluster :)
[02:11:25] <nucc1> not hundreds or thousands like yours
[02:11:48] <nucc1> each device needs to know the state of it's peers so it can make an accurate decision about when to come online
[02:13:41] <ordos> nucc1, do you know much about spiking neural nets? This consulting firm came in to pitch us a SNN solution to help us calibrate the network on boot. Their idea is that batteries can be taken offline and brought back online automatically based on prediction of demand (as opposed to current demand). Fascinating stuff.

[02:14:52] <Blondie101010> well AI/ML is based on a feedback loop, so you need to already have the information available

[02:15:51] <nucc1> nay, you can use something like histograms
[02:16:01] <nucc1> the more detailed your histogram, the more accurate your predictions can be.
[02:16:02] <ordos> I like regressions.
[02:16:08] <ordos> That's how we did it in the 90s.

[02:23:29] <Blondie101010> not familiar with fluent...  would your approach send to fluent which would relay to splunk?
[02:23:45] <nucc1> my understanding is you don't need splunk if you use fluent
[02:23:58] <nucc1> and you were looking for a way to log directly to some collector and bypass the system syslog
[02:24:01] <Blondie101010> ok, so that is out of the question, at least for now
[02:24:10] <nucc1> ah, i thought you were trying to avoid splunk
[02:24:20] <Blondie101010> nah
[02:24:25] <Northwoods> how long can we stick to our current computer , i mean what parameters decide its time to upgrade  for programmers ?
[02:24:29] <Blondie101010> I actually like Splunk
[02:24:56] <nucc1> Northwoods: many companies just have a time duration tied to warranty of the device.
[02:25:16] <nucc1> and a budget limit. so every X number of years, you buy the best device you can buy for $Y
[02:25:17] <Northwoods> nucc1, like mobile devices have untutu benchmarks
[02:25:34] <Blondie101010> Northwoods:  that would depend on your actual requirements, as long as it can be maintained up to date
[02:25:45] <nucc1> Northwoods: unless you're doing game development or machine learning, almost any computer in the last 5 years is good enough :)
[02:25:55] <Blondie101010> even more

[02:33:59] <Blondie101010> Northwoods:  like more components, if you don't make it overheat too much, it should last longer than you'll want it
[02:34:19] <ordos> Northwoods, it's ok, I'm a member of the Republic of Gamers. I registered with them when I installed the drivers.

[02:38:46] <Blondie101010> hmmm, I connected to BBS with a 286 with 1.5GB of RAM
[02:38:49] <nucc1> nowadays, there's the temptation to get a smaller box that is as fast or faster than your old box
[02:38:58] <Blondie101010> and a 2400 modem

[02:43:56] <__adrian> so, not how i read that. but yes, if you're actually using it.
[02:43:56] <Blondie101010> putting it on a VM can be tricky
[02:44:17] <nucc1> dual booting is a pain, and linux runs better in a windows VM on my hardware
[02:44:34] <nucc1> on an nvme drive with loads of ram, it's fast enough

[02:45:02] <nucc1> and i can have as many linux VMs as i want.
[02:45:08] <nucc1> and destroy and create them as needed too
[02:45:22] <Blondie101010> what hypervisor do you use?

[02:46:21] <__adrian> recent realtek lan? thunderbolt 3? some kind of really dumb ssd?
[02:46:28] <Blondie101010> but since you pay for Vmware, I'd probably opt for VirtualBox instead
[02:46:46] <nucc1> __adrian: everything runs on windows better :) ... linux is best as a server/headless dev machine
[02:47:02] <__adrian> heh, if you say so

[02:47:31] * __adrian shrugs
[02:47:35] <__adrian> i've not experienced that
[02:47:36] <nucc1> nope, you can do fractional scaling on windows
[02:47:48] <nucc1> i get 100%, 200%... on linux, last i checked.
[02:48:14] <__adrian> not used fractional scaling for any length of time though

[02:48:59] <nucc1> the problem is *me*, not the OS.
[02:49:08] <nucc1> well, windows and Mac handle this just fine.
[02:49:42] <__adrian> i've _used_ it, just not for any real length of time. i'm saying i couldn't say, but i've never _seen_ problems.
[02:49:51] <__adrian> "wrong monitor" is incidental
[02:50:22] <Blondie101010> last time I tried to fine tune my display I abandonned when I got something acceptable with different resolutions on the 2 monitors
[02:50:26] <nucc1> i'm very comfortable with linux... but i wiped my boxes and settled on windows, virtualize linux after too many problems...
[02:50:34] <__adrian> considering scaling alone, fractional is always the wrong choice. you _necessarily_ lose quality
[02:50:37] <nucc1> long story basically.
[02:50:52] <nucc1> i have 28 inch monitors, and i wanted high DPI
[02:50:58] <Blondie101010> the optimal resolution for my monitor makes my work graphs unreadable :)
[02:51:09] <nucc1> scaling to 150% on 4k resolution, the quality is better than an unscaled lower res display
[02:51:27] <__adrian> .__.  of course it is
[02:51:41] <__adrian> but not as good as if you'd chosen a monitor with the right pixel density to start with
[02:51:49] <__adrian> right = desired
[02:51:49] <nucc1> what such monitor is there?
[02:52:23] <nucc1> i mean, even a 32inch 4k monitor is probably too small to be comfortable at 4k
[02:52:29] <__adrian> matter of taste. i find ~110ppi to be very nice

[03:09:40] <__adrian> though my current board is technically 109 + media keys + scroll wheel
[03:09:55] <nucc1> da_wunder: "organise" LOL :d. i use a single workspace, and everything is strewn everywhere... when i can no longer find stuff, i start closing old things
[03:09:56] <__adrian> 10-key is easier to pound on
[03:09:57] <ordos> Media keys and scroll wheel is precisely why I purchased my 915
[03:10:08] <ordos> __adrian, fair enough
[03:10:12] <ordos> I never need to pound
[03:10:13] <da_wunder> and imho numpad is not needed, 75% keyboard is the thing for me
[03:10:17] <ordos> Please don't quote me boys.
[03:10:27] <nucc1> yea, 75% keyboard, or whatever it is without numpad
[03:10:31] <ordos> TKL
[03:10:34] <nucc1> i'm not an accountant :)
[03:10:41] <ordos> Ten-Key-Less
[03:10:52] <nucc1> yea, i learned that yesterday lol
[03:11:03] <ordos> I learned that when my son brought home that Rog Strix
[03:11:05] <nucc1> i was reading about the new logitech 915 tkl or something
[03:11:12] <ordos> nucc1, that's the one I've got
[03:11:35] <nucc1> i've got an old wasd... which is absolutely fine... but such is the nature of things... :d
[03:11:38] <da_wunder> nowadays 75% is more clearer term, because there are even smaller keyboards
[03:11:38] <ordos> Fastest keyboard I've ever had the pleasure of typing on
[03:12:02] <ordos> da_wunder, yeah I saw that GMMK. Beautiful piece of engineering. But I have wide hands.
[03:12:31] <da_wunder> and once again, use what _you_ like most
[03:12:34] <ordos> Amen
[03:12:35] <__adrian> yes
[03:13:10] <ordos> I had this Sensei back in the day. He had the same philosophy on striking.
[03:13:28] <__adrian> odd philosophy
[03:13:52] <ordos> __adrian, I didn't question it. He was 7th or 8th dan or something.
[03:13:59] <ordos> Hachidan

[03:17:57] <ordos> I branched out to boxing, and later Kung Fu (Northern Long Fist). I wish I did more wrestling though.

[03:19:59] <ordos> I watched some live bouts in Koh Samui. They were dragged out battering contests.
[03:20:01] <__adrian> match was 38 seconds long.

[03:20:40] <__adrian> i drove an hour and a half for that match.

[03:21:49] <ordos> __adrian, those fundamentals you allude to - I think that's what my Sensei was going on about. He had this straight punch he loved to use on us. All the damn time.
[03:22:20] <ordos> The whole "use what _you_ like most" idea.
[03:23:07] <__adrian> heh. he had a punch that you didn't even _see_ until it was maving back away from your face.

[11:37:08] <ericlee> Hi, while PHP is processing PUT request, it will load all data into memory first then write to the destination? Or, it can read a chunk of data and write to the destination in rounds?
[11:41:48] <TML> ericlee: It reads it into memory
[11:42:19] <ericlee> TML, I see, thanks. so how can I reduce the memory usage if I'm uploading a large file?
[11:43:29] <TML> ericlee: You can try processing it as a php://input stream
[11:43:48] <TML> ericlee: But, as a general rule, HTTP PUT is a pretty terrible UX for uploading large files
[11:45:19] <ericlee> TML, oh okay, I'm using php://input but still see it's loading all data into mmeory.

[11:59:39] *** Quits: tex (~super@user/dix) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[11:59:41] <TML> but that is as much a limitation of HTTP as it is of PHP
[12:00:26] <TML> as for php://input, you can absolutely read it a few bytes at a time, but you'll probably need to read some stream handling tutorials to get all the nuances correct
[12:00:52] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[12:01:46] <TML> As a general rule, I don't visit pastebin.com links, but if you're seeing php://input reading everything into memory first, you probably did it wrong
[12:03:33] <TML> ericlee: keep in mind that aside from the PHP engine reading things into memory, you also likely have the HTTPd layer reading it into memory in the first place
[12:03:53] <TML> so seeing RSS go up doesn't actually mean PHP read everything into memory
[12:04:44] <ericlee> TML, thanks. because I'm trying to upload a 10G file and I do see the RSS becomes 10G so wondering if it's loaded into memory fully.
[12:05:21] <TML> ericlee: Don't send a 10GB file over HTTP

[20:02:46] <dimi1947> question...when sending enails(w phpmailer) do i need to use isSMTP()?
[20:08:21] <TinoDidriksen> No
[20:10:45] <da_wunder> isn't phpmailer a bit old library?
[20:11:19] <TinoDidriksen> So? It's actively maintained.
[20:12:12] *** Quits: MJCD (uid193337@user/mjcd) ()
[20:12:22] <da_wunder> might be, I just remembered to use that like years ago, before moving to swiftmailer and after that to symfony mailer component

[20:33:05] <da_wunder> if you're doing that for dev purposes I really recommend you to use eg. mailcatcher - https://mailcatcher.me/ - and if that is for production - you should ask email settings from your hosting provider

[20:33:25] *** Joins: ramsey[p] (~ramseyp]@user/ramsey)
[20:33:56] <da_wunder> that mailcatcher is really easy to use with docker and you don't accidentally send emails to real users
[20:34:31] <TinoDidriksen> dimi1947, you need an MTA, these days usually Postfix or Exim (older days: sendmail). Why do you want to send locally instead of via a trusted 3rd party SMTP?
[20:34:56] <da_wunder> like sendgrid, mailgun, etc.
[20:34:59] <dimi1947> such as google for exampl?
[20:35:02] <TinoDidriksen> Can even send via Google Mail, if you have a company account there.
[20:35:27] <TinoDidriksen> Actually, don't even need a company account.
[20:35:41] <dimi1947> ok....so I will need stmp google server...

[20:37:20] <dimi1947> so locally there is no need for any server...
[20:37:38] <da_wunder> for dev I would use that mailcatcher
[20:38:18] <da_wunder> and for your production just use some email provider like sendgrid, mailgun, etc. or ask your hosting provider what do they offer for that
[20:38:39] <dimi1947> I need it for dev
[20:39:00] <da_wunder> then I would use mailcatcher
[20:40:21] <da_wunder> using that via docker-compose setup is quite trivial

[20:43:00] <da_wunder> something simple like - https://gist.github.com/tarlepp/bde748d0bb0c44ce0cfb4d311d2f9dc5
[20:43:53] <da_wunder> and then just run `docker-compose up` command and you've mailcatcher smtp server running on that mailer dns address - and you can access those emails just by opening localhost:1080 in your browser

[20:53:11] <da_wunder> and all that you need to change dev vs prod is that mailer dns - simple as that
[20:56:35] <da_wunder> assuming things like that are configurable in your application - and if not - you really should make those configurable per environment

[21:11:25] <Blondie101010> dimi1947:  I didn't read the whole scrollback...  are you trying to send from that gmail address or a different address?
[21:11:44] <TinoDidriksen> You need to enable less secure login via https://myaccount.google.com/security - or enable 2FA and create an app password.
[21:11:58] <TinoDidriksen> 2FA is the best way.
[21:12:19] <Blondie101010> welllll that depends here
[21:13:02] <Blondie101010> no one would want to enter any auth for every email sent from a script :)
[21:13:12] <dimi1947> yes...the message I get is that the app trying to login(me) does not comply w required safety standards
[21:13:21] <Blondie101010> which is correct
[21:15:36] <dimi1947> well...I enabled access from less secure apps...will try again now
[21:17:09] <TinoDidriksen> I highly recommend enabling 2FA and creating an app password. That's the reasonably secure way to do this.
[21:17:35] <Blondie101010> how would you handle 2FA in that kind of situation?
[21:18:07] <TinoDidriksen> That's what the app password is for - it bypasses 2FA, but is less powerful.
[21:18:37] <TinoDidriksen> I know this works, because that's how we use Gmail to send company emails.
[21:23:21] <dimi1947> how am I going ti enable 2fa
[21:23:32] <Blondie101010> ahhh ok, I get your point
