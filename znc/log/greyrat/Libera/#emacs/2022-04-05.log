[05:09:20] <wgreenhouse> parsnip: yep
[05:09:46] <wgreenhouse> twb: outlook still supports the dumb text/enriched stuff too if you're feeling eccentric
[05:10:04] <parsnip> wgreenhouse: right, i believe it's a round trip, through for example, a mutt user replies to an original Outlook email. the Outlook composed part becomes tripel line breaks, because that's actually what Outlook is sending.
[05:10:23] <parsnip> wgreenhouse: Outlook sends something like <p><p> <p> between paragraphs.
[05:10:31] <parsnip> because legacy
[05:10:47] <parsnip> they could fix it, but it would break very old Outlook clients, presumably

[05:56:32] <parsnip> i wanted a heuristic to decide when to visually wrap an email
[05:56:33] <twb> why don't you just prune instead of highlighting
[05:56:38] <parsnip> like, for reading
[05:56:53] <twb> parsnip: you don't need a heuristic; that is coded into the Content-Type
[05:56:59] <parsnip> twb: you mean interspersed posting? that's the joke.
[05:57:11] <twb> Even when I top-post, I still prune
[05:57:35] <twb> Failure to do so is an indication that you hate the recipient and want to waste their time
[05:57:48] <parsnip> twb: i don't think always. i don't want to visually wrap if user inserted hard line breaks. but some emails may contain one or two long lines.
[05:58:28] <parsnip> twb: lol no
[05:58:45] <twb> parsnip: those two different styles are declaimed in the Content-Type
[05:58:53] <parsnip> my supervisor would clean emails by removing old parts of thread that were not copied in existing replies
[05:58:53] <twb> I'm trying to remember what it is called
[05:59:12] <twb> format=flowed IIRC
[05:59:25] <twb> https://fastmail.blog/advanced/format-flowed/
[05:59:50] <parsnip> twb: consider this
[05:59:56] <parsnip> user doesn't send format=flowed
[06:00:08] <parsnip> but they have some long lines, like bulleted links, for example
[06:00:26] <parsnip> then, independent of that, they choose to wrap paragraphs or not
[06:00:33] <parsnip> i want to detect those two cases
[06:00:34] <twb> parsnip: so you want to control wrapping in text/html?
[06:00:42] <parsnip> i think that needs a heuristic
[06:00:52] <twb> fix your client's CSS
[06:01:05] <parsnip> this can be plain
[06:01:24] <parsnip> i don't want to enable visual line mode 90% of the lines are shorter than 90
[06:01:27] <twb> for plain, the sender should either hard-wrap, or use format=flowed.  Failure to do one or the other indicates they hate you
[06:02:22] <parsnip> or they've barely configured mutt or mu4e
[06:02:29] <parsnip> which i don't think implies hate

[09:23:27] <tsdh> afidegnum: A good way is to generate the new buffer contents in a separate buffer (like call-process with output to a tmp buffer) and then replace the contents of the original buffer with replace-buffer-contents.  That has the benefit of point and marks sticking to their original positions which is great if your buffer content stays very similar, e.g., your executable is like a source code formatter or something ali

[10:41:38] <bpalmer> you can get a string consisting of 4 characters, the last character of which is a backslash, by typing "bcd\\" in elisp, or (read-from-minibuffer "go: ") and then typing four characters, the last of which is a backslash. If you were to print that string in elisp, you would see "bcd\\"
[10:42:07] <bpalmer> That might look like it's five characters long. If you were to take the length of that string, you would see it's four.

[10:42:51] <parsnip> or formatting with eglot or lsp-mode
[10:42:59] <bpalmer> aeroplane: When you type elisp, like when you type a test case, you have to account for the language's escape characters. If you are reading the string from somewhere else, you may not -- depending on how you read the string.

[13:45:26] <parsnip> it's a reasonable question

[22:41:42] <edgar-rft> haha, stupid bot :-)
[22:41:57] <bpalmer> at least firefox sticks with ordinals
[22:42:02] <Psybur> how do i replicate 'ssh -W host:port target' with tramp?

[22:42:44] <Psybur> pipes and default proxy list dont seem to be working
[22:43:56] <bjc> iirc, tramp will use your .ssh/config
[22:44:02] <bjc> so you can add an alias there with the right port
[22:45:03] <Psybur> happen to know how to do that for -W i only saw it for multihop. these arent the same thing right

[22:45:24] <bjc> not off the top of my head. i believe all ssh options can be specified in the config
[22:45:28] <bjc> but you'd have to check the man page
