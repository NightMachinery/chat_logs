As a general rule, Guy Fawkes Day / Bonfire Night has always been a much bigger deal – perhaps because the dates are close together and they're both a bit subversive in nature"
[01:44:38] <bin_bat> okay but how tf is Halloween "subversive"?

[19:35:37] <fentanyl> I often see native English speakers use the phrase "get the fuck out of here" in places where they're either talking among friends or for a humor. But to be it sounds inappropriate and offensive. What's the context when native speakers use that phrase? (Can any native speaker help clear this out for me?) 
[19:38:09] <MetaNova> fentanyl: it's used to mean, "I have difficulty believing what you say, because it sounds so outlandish"
[19:40:52] <MetaNova> an older version being, "get [the fuck] out of town" I'm fairly sure
[19:41:28] <MetaNova> I think the construction of that slang has to do with forcing people out of towns ("run them out") when they were suspected of selling snakeoil/preaching unwanted things/spreading fear, "He's going to be run out of town by tomorrow if he keeps it up"
[19:42:09] <MetaNova> so, when someone says, "get out of town" in conversation, it basically means the same as I said above, "I have difficulty believing what you say, because it sounds so outlandish"
[19:42:23] <MetaNova> because the implication is, they'll get run out of town for their words
[19:42:33] <MetaNova> your example is a variation of this
[19:42:39] <MetaNova> that's my understanding, anyway
[19:44:34] <fentanyl> I see, I often come across that phrase in videos and personally found very offensive (although I guess, I ain't a native speaker).
[19:44:49] <fentanyl> s/guess/guess since/
[19:44:49] <chat> fentanyl meant to say: I see, I often come across that phrase in videos and personally found very offensive (although I guess since, I ain't a native speaker).

[19:45:13] <hideaway> Throwing in the F bomb kind of does make it somewhat offensive

[20:11:09] <MetaNova> if I were talking about messages on discord I'd call them DMs, if I were referring to IRC, I'd call them PMs
[20:11:15] <FLHerne> and again that derives from what the button was labelled as
[20:11:15] <MetaNova> FLHerne: correct
[20:11:30] <DeepComa> they're both interchangeable
[20:11:49] <MetaNova> they're not interchangeable, they're just highly equivalent
[20:12:03] <FLHerne> Well, same meaning, but if you said "DM" about IRC queries I'd think you were an IRC n00b :p
[20:12:22] <MetaNova> or if I say PM while using discord, people will ask me what I mean
[20:12:48] <MetaNova> similarly "server" on discord means "channel" on IRC, and "chat room" basically everywhere else
[20:13:17] <DeepComa> They're the same thing, DM is a newly coined term. Back in Yahoo days, people would call it PM or IM (Instant Message.)
[20:13:41] <MetaNova> or how "admin" on a forum, "mod" ("moderator") on reddit, and ircop/chanop on IRC
[20:13:42] <DeepComa> Check your DMs
[20:14:07] <DeepComa> -As in ^^
[20:14:14] <FLHerne> Jong: So, short answer: different chat services [or systems in general] often have similar features, but don't necessarily use the same name for them
[20:14:23] <FLHerne> Oh yeah, I remember IM being a thing

[20:15:02] <MetaNova> (I still IM my father)
[20:15:18] <DeepComa> Just like Spam refers to email\ forum, Spim is for Instant Messaging.
[20:15:35] <MetaNova> lol, never heard "spim" before
[20:15:37] <FLHerne> Now, I don't remember the word "spim" ever being seriously used :p
[20:15:46] <DeepComa> ya
[20:16:22] <Bayes> is omitting "that" in a sentence like "[...] is the same in all the situations (that) we consider" ok for formal writing?
[20:16:23] <DeepComa> Just if you want to be technical about it ^^
[20:16:32] <DeepComa> @ MetaNova
[20:16:51] <MetaNova> Bayes: no
[20:17:24] <MetaNova> oh, sorry, I misread the question
[20:17:35] <MetaNova> Bayes: yes, I think that's fine
[20:17:36] <FLHerne> fentanyl: Like "what the fuck" / "wtf", the "TF" bit of "GTFO" is an almost meaningless intensifier
[20:17:42] <hideaway> The word "that" can sometimes be omitted
[20:18:18] <hideaway> MetaNova said (that) he misread the question.
[20:18:23] <Bayes> neato, I know it can be omitted in informal speech and in a case like the above it seems clear enough but whatever
[20:18:50] <fentanyl> FLHerne: I see
[20:19:05] <fentanyl> I was shocked first time I heard it.
[20:19:24] <FLHerne> and also like "wtf", it can be used in every sense of surprise/disbelief from "that is awful and I despise it/you" to "that is awesome and I find it/you hilarious"
[20:19:34] <FLHerne> making it rather hard to parse
[20:19:36] <fentanyl> I see it was used by a stand-up comedian against an audience member, everyone laughed but I was shocked/offended AF
[20:21:13] <MetaNova> fentanyl: it long, long, long ago lost any vulgarity to me (in the uses in FLHerne's overview), so now it's merely an annoyance when it's used needlessly, or because it no longer functions as an intensifier (when one is warranted)
[20:22:13] <FLHerne> MetaNova: well, it still has enough vulgarity to be avoided in any kind of formal/professional situation
[20:22:59] <MetaNova> that's true
[20:23:29] <MetaNova> I did qualify my statement with "to me"
[20:23:35] <MetaNova> but that's still true
[20:24:24] <FLHerne> fentanyl: I assume the AF there was deliberate irony? :D
