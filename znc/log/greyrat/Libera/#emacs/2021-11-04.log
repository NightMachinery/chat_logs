[00:39:08] <pjb> johnjay: it's strange, because Common Lisp is meant to be the common lisp: it's made so that other lisps could come closer to the common semantics of lisp.
[00:39:18] <jfb4> artefact:ah thanks 
[00:39:35] <pjb> johnjay: ie. the point is that if there's a rplaca function in emacs lisp, it should swap its result, so that it's the same as CL:RPLACA !
[00:40:43] <pjb> johnjay: which doesn't prevent anybody to implement subsets or supersets or subsets of supersets of CL. But it'd be nice to have a similar package system so that you can do that in a compatible way!
[00:41:26] <johnjay> i don't actually know what clashes there are
[00:41:35] <johnjay> i.e. same name in emacs but different semantic
[00:41:45] <pjb> ie. you could have (el:rplaca (cons 'a 'd) 42) --> (42 . d) while (cl:rplaca (cons 'a 'd) 42) #| --> (42 . d) |# 
[00:42:08] <pjb> johnjay: almost all.
[00:42:57] <pjb> johnjay: or none, if you consider that (symbol-name 'car) --> "car" vs. (symbol-name 'car) #| --> "CAR" |# 
[00:43:07] <pjb> johnjay: but then you'd have to provide a readtable like in CL!!!
[00:43:42] <pjb> my grit here is that for 40 years, emacs lisp has stubbornly tried to diverge from CL, instead of the opposite.
[00:43:50] <acdw> ^^
[00:44:07] <acdw> prolly woulda been better if elisp were just CL with like, edit-y extensions
[00:45:37] <pjb> No wonder they're trying to redo it in scheme or something.

[01:07:55] <johnjay> i thought there was a way to read directly into a string. rats
[01:07:57] <pjb> jumping means buffer.
[01:08:07] <pjb> theothornhill: then just record it.
[01:08:17] <pjb> ("/path/to/the/file" . 42)

[01:09:15] <pjb> (list path line column)
[01:09:48] <theothornhill> yeah, that is what I'm doing, and it works fine, but when writing a backend to consult I need to resolve the diagnostics
[01:09:50] <pjb> and then you will use line and column when you have to visit it: (find-file (first rec)) (goto-char (point-min)) (forward-line (second rec)) (forward-char (third rec))

[01:14:52] <theothornhill> It can actually provide a clean file name not associated with a buffer.  I've been working a little with joao to improve that part, but to get the correct beg end I need to visit the file
[01:14:53] <pjb> You may have to present abuffer with a list of (unvisited) files with diagnostics, and only when the user selects a file, you will visit it and convert the json to flymake--diags.
[01:15:07] <pjb> theothornhill: definitely.
[01:15:23] <pjb> theothornhill: or, you can use markers, and set them once you visit the file, not before.
[01:15:34] <theothornhill> oh
[01:15:56] <pjb> but markers need a buffer, so no go.
[01:16:22] <theothornhill> how would I do that? Can I visit the file, go to the point I want, record a marker, then clear the temp buffer but keep the marker?

[01:24:00] *** Quits: desantra (~skykanin@user/skykanin) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[01:24:20] <pjb> theothornhill: markers are made so that if you insert or remove stuff before markers, they're updated so the position is always the same relative to the text.
[01:24:25] <theothornhill> yeah, but that shouldn't be an issue as the lsp server should be able to see that
[01:25:07] <pjb> theothornhill: indeed.  Hence just keeping a list (path line column) should be enough.  So you cannot convert to flymake--diag immediately, you have to do that upon visiting the file.

[01:27:38] <theothornhill> Well, it's not the end of the world.  It could be possible to actually visit every file and get the real deal as long as it's behind a defcustom i guess
[01:27:58] <theothornhill> So that I don't open 100 files by default

[02:11:32] <Catie> It's not that bad, a lot of channels don't have much activity

[02:12:05] <masterbuilder> Catie: Unfortunately, I lurk in some channels where literally nobody ever says anything, all day, every day

[02:12:29] <Narcht007> i'm using emacs too, how do i do this?
[02:12:30] <Catie> masterbuilder: I mostly see activity in this channel and honestly I kind of prefer it that way
[02:12:49] <Catie> Narcht007: which client are you using? The main ones are rcirc and ERC
[02:12:52] <masterbuilder> Yeah the big channels are pretty active, but not too active

[02:14:08] <wickedjargon> Question:
[02:14:19] <aidalgol> Answer
[02:14:19] <Catie> Unless ERC works differently from how I think it does, that'll open the new channel in a different buffer
[02:14:33] <wickedjargon> This is how you bind a key in evil normal mode:      (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-d") 'mc/mark-all-dwim)

[02:16:32] <Narcht007> I'm gonna try again,i think it doesn't open another buffer, but it kinda "close" this
[02:16:41] <masterbuilder> wickedjargon: I would recommend having a good look at the evil documentation, unfortunately it's not great, and look around in the source code, read the docstrings for some functions and variables and such. evil-mode is actually pretty complicated IME, hopefully somebody can answer your question but I think if you want to do some slightly more advanced things you just have to learn how it works

[04:29:06] <Dima`> Hey guys,
[04:29:07] <Dima`> I have a question about emms (I am on the latest version 7.8).
[04:29:07] <Dima`>  
[04:29:07] <Dima`> It just does not want to display the total track length for me :(
[04:29:09] <Dima`>  
[04:29:13] <Dima`> The code below is used to fetch the total playing time but it always returns nil for me.
[04:29:16] <Dima`> I checked with mplayer and with vlc, but the 
[04:29:19] <Dima`> (emms-track-get (emms-playlist-current-selected-track) 'info-playing-time)
[04:29:22] <Dima`>  
[04:29:25] <Dima`> (emms-playlist-current-selected-track) returns a lot of other information, just not the 'info-playing-time.
[04:29:28] <Dima`>  
[04:29:31] <Dima`> I tried running emms with the bare configuration and it is also missing.
[04:29:34] <Dima`>  
[04:29:38] <Dima`> Does anyone have a clue what might be going on? I also reset the eww-cache and let it reindex the files.

[12:31:18] <artefact> scanners use weird image formats for b/w scans iirc, like ccitt stuff
[12:31:27] <artefact> can you not just open the pdf in eg, gimp or xournal?

[18:09:41] <hodapp> in this case, I don't think it's actually a reference to it

[18:27:50] <grym> i don't like factory farming abuses; i have no compunctions about, and in fact actually have, fed the calf for a year, ate the calf the next year 
[18:28:16] <grym> so like, i buy pasture raised eggs because i think it's ecologically more sound; it's also tastier 
[18:28:30] <grym> but mostly i want them chickens out there eating mosquitoes 
[18:28:46] <hodapp> buuuut my main thing is that I think the diet in the US is just stupidly meat-heavy and in ways that are neither tasty nor healthy
[18:28:53] <hodapp> ...nor sustainable
[18:29:09] <grym> Bayes: the more serious and more interesting book that i think you'd actually _like_ is annie dillard's  "pilgrim at tinker creek"
[18:29:16] <Bayes> taeaad I don't have an informed opinion on everything, I just feel like having them as part of our diet is not necessary and I can live without animal products so no need to raise and kill them etc
[18:30:09] <Bayes> same with hunting, I don't like shooting wild animals for the lulz
[18:30:20] <grym> hodapp: yeah; those critiques are kind of broad-brushy in a way that intersects annoyingly with my life.  because i don't think they apply well to me, but i keep being told (not by you right now, so we're clear) that they totally do apply to me, you idiot, look how little you konw about yourself

[18:32:52] <grym> (friend of mine did her dissertation on that, so i've been drunkenly lectured to a few times) 
[18:32:53] <taeaad> Bayes: Alright. The only reason why I am asking is because in Southern Africa apex predators on most of the land are absent, and in fact if you rear lion there are other complications (e.g. you need very expensive fencing). So the humans are the apex predators for impala, kudu, eland, etc. Even giraffe for that matter. And you can rehabilitate land from cattle to the aforementioned (I've seen such cases and the vegetation also recovers
[18:32:53] <taeaad> once you place the animals back.) But you can't add elephant or lion back. Elephant are very destructive and lion like I mentioned are dangerous and you can't really add them back realistically. So this means that the humans fulfill a custodian role that includes eating the game. But prices in general are low, much lower than per kg of cattle. But it should eventually be more expensive and more sought after than cattle meat.

[18:33:54] <grym> the other way to solve the deer problem in new england is just reintroduce their predators, but we seem reluctant to do this 
[18:34:11] <taeaad> This doesn't hold for Kruger National Park, for example. There you have the ability to have both lion and elephant. In fact, elephants are overpopulated there and Southern Africa singlehandedly is preventing extinction of elephant as you would see in central Africa.

[18:34:57] <rpav> heh
[18:35:12] <grym> hodapp: because USDA makes it very bothersome to be certified to process, and small-scale processing plants can't/won't afford it

[23:32:24] <Bayes> so the best I've found so far is rg --color=always '\[0, 1\]' | less -R
[23:32:45] <Bayes> the only issue is that less now is messing up the return lines xD
[23:33:07] <Bayes> even when using --color=auto
[23:33:54] <Bayes> it's not an issue about the colors tho, it's just how less behaves

[23:40:04] <praevalens> Catie: yes i can see the cursor before killing the buffer
[23:41:06] <Catie> Are you killing the buffer with C-x k or just by pressing 'q'?
[23:41:34] *** Joins: winny__ (~weechat@user/winny)
[23:42:19] <praevalens> I use C-x k  
[23:43:00] <Catie> Does it do the same thing for you either way?
[23:43:49] <praevalens> Okay I exactly want whats happening when I press q but with C-x k it behaves differently. But I stole a function somewhere to not ask for confirmation before killing the current buffer
[23:44:50] <praevalens> relevant code : https://bpa.st/APHQ

[23:45:30] *** Joins: _bladez_ (~bladez@user/bladez/x-6019614)
[23:46:49] <Catie> Oh yeah gotcha, so you don't have to choose the buffer to kill. Killing buffers tends, in my experience, to be a bit less graceful than using the mode-provided quit functions
[23:48:15] <praevalens> Okay maybe a little hack to rebind C-x k to q but only for the undo tree buffer then ? It's gotten a force of habit to kill a widow like that
[23:48:34] <praevalens> window* sry nsa
[23:49:52] <Catie> You can do that, yeah! I recommend just using the default keybindings, but that's the really nice thing about Emacs
[23:50:31] <Catie> The keymap it uses is map undo-tree-visualizer-mode-map
[23:51:02] <Catie> Sorry, ignore that first "map"
[23:54:07] <praevalens> I found it with C-h v ty! would smth like this work in my config : (setq undo-tree-visualizer-mode-map '("C-x k" . undo-tree-visualizer-quit))  ? Im really no elisp coder ^^

[23:54:54] <Catie> Okay, perfect! No, I don't think you should reset the entire undo-tree-visualizer-mode-map
[23:55:37] <Catie> I'd do something like (define-key undo-tree-visualizer-mode-map (kbd "C-x k") #'undo-tree-visualizer-quit)

[23:56:08] <praevalens> ah ty ^^ that way it also preserve the q binding neat! 
[23:56:41] <Catie> Yeah! It'll only override C-k k in that one mode, and everything else will be as it was
[23:57:06] <praevalens> It works and Im content. Thank you so much !
[23:57:34] <Catie> Maybe you don't need to do sharpsign-quote? I got warnings for it on my home machine, but my work computer has no such issue
[23:57:57] <Catie> You could do 'undo-tree... instead of #'undo-tree...
[23:59:09] <praevalens> okay I will note that in a comment in case something breaks
