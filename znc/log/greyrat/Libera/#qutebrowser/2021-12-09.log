[10:32:20] <famubu> Hi. Is there a way to change the key bindings for navigating a page (eg: next page) when opening a pdf file withing qutebrowser using pdfjs? Found pdfjs shortcuts at https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#what-are-the-pdfjs-keyboard-shortcuts but wasn't sure if that can be changed.
[10:33:59] <famubu> By default 'n' is next page. I was trying to make it C-f.

[11:57:29] <ktprograms> Hi, it appears that qutebrowser doesn't send login cookies when downloading files, but it does when opening them. When I try to download Advent of Code puzzle input, I get this error: 'Error transferring https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/9/input - server replied: Bad request', but if I hit <Enter> fast enough after selecting the input link for downloading (with ';d'), it does get downloaded, but 
[11:57:35] <ktprograms> the contents of the file is: 'Puzzle inputs differ by user. Please log in to get your puzzle input.', which is the same response as when I use curl on the input URL (without sending any cookies).
