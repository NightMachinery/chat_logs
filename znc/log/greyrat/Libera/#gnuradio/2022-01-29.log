[01:44:50] <duude__> Hello people :)
[01:45:08] <duude__> I still haven't managed to figure out how to do this properly sadly heh. What would be the most efficient way of "mixing" one signal source (wavefile) to have multiple outputs?
[01:45:28] <warnes[m]> Turing off AGC.
[01:45:31] <drmpeg> For the glitch, look for overflows or underflows.
[01:45:54] <warnes[m]> duude__: You can connect one block output to multiple block inputs...
[01:45:59] <muaddib[m]> duude__: are you just trying to play a wav file and have it come out of multiple outputs??
[01:46:00] <drmpeg> I think you can set "verbosity" to debug for that,
[01:46:46] <warnes[m]> I had it set to 'verbose' which is one step beyond 'debug' and didn't see any over/underrun messages.
[01:46:59] <drmpeg> Ok.
[01:47:09] <duude__> warnes: Yup, figured out that, but is there a better way to do it apart from making a virtual sink and then using add and multiply blocks many times to shift the frequency as needed?
[01:47:21] <duude__> muaddib: Yeah more or less I
[01:47:31] <duude__> Yeah more or less*

[01:48:04] <duude__> For example, I'd like it to apepar on 2412MHz, 2416MHz, 2422MHz, 2445MHz etc..
[01:48:19] <warnes[m]> Use an iFFT?
[01:48:34] <duude__> Completely variable frequencies, which is easy when there's only a few
[01:48:46] <muaddib[m]> warnes[m]: ooooh, very nice
[01:48:46] <warnes[m]> drmpeg: disabled AGC, spike is still presentt.
[01:48:51] <duude__> But what if there's I don't know.. let's say 20?
[01:49:17] <muaddib[m]> check out the gr-smartmeters project
[01:49:46] <muaddib[m]> Hash: was on here day and night working through how to do 240 channels at the same time
[01:49:58] <duude__> warnes: Good idea. Do you happen to have any block diagram examples you could share a link for?
[01:50:05] <duude__> I'm trying to visualize it in my head
[01:50:11] <muaddib[m]> he was using a polyphase synthesizer then drmpeg dropped the 'why don't you use an IFFT' bomb
[01:50:14] <muaddib[m]> minds were blown
[01:50:18] <duude__> Yeah
[01:50:24] <duude__> I was using a polyp.
[01:50:28] <duude__> Wasn't very efficient
[01:50:35] <duude__> But was better than a ton of add/multiply blocks
[01:50:54] <duude__> And then I realized, I can't shift frequencies randomly as I could with addition/subtraction
[01:51:17] <duude__> They all had to be spaced the same from each other hah

[02:04:03] <neelpandeya[m]> I have not had a chance to look through the chat history...  But are you all set at this point?
[02:09:16] <patchvonbraun[m]> The problem is that at the nosebleed end of the SDR hardware spectrum, there's just so damned many knobs to tweak, it's hard to tell whether there's a problem or not.  This is true not just for the users of the hardware, but the people putting together QA and release-testing procedures as well.   The most challenging environment I've encountered in my 40+ year career.
[02:10:33] <muaddib[m]> THANK YOU!

[02:11:20] <drmpeg> He could have a career in audio books.
[02:15:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> When you have a designed-for-a-particular-purpose radio, it's fairly easy to tell whether it's "working" or not.  Construction of QA and release tests would be fairly straightforward.    But if the requirement is "all the applications that we know about and that we don't know about should work as expected"  that's a much harder thing to achieve.

[02:41:46] <patchvonbraun[m]> muaddib: NOt the only reason--multiple channels, high bandwidth, large tuning range, big sample sizes, larger FPGA spce, etc, etc.

[02:42:16] <DerekKozel[m]> Timed tuning and RF commands
[02:43:01] <patchvonbraun[m]> I've always thought that UHD should have an adjunct "scenario library".  Where you could say "OK, you know what device I have, set it up to do <foo>"
[02:43:28] <patchvonbraun[m]> I suspect most <foo> would turn out to be related to phase-coherence...
[02:46:34] <patchvonbraun[m]> I sometimes pine for the simipler times of the USRP1 :) :)
[02:49:11] <DerekKozel[m]> Uhd_fft has a phase coherence test mode
[02:49:31] <DerekKozel[m]> It worked on the N320 last I had a chance to try it
[02:52:16] <DerekKozel[m]> And the twinrx
[02:54:39] <patchvonbraun[m]> I don't think it has anything for lo-sharing, though
[02:54:54] <patchvonbraun[m]> (quick grep through the .grc file for uhd_fft)
[02:55:33] <DerekKozel[m]> Hmm. I definitely had a version that allowed full config of the LOs

[03:24:46] <muaddib[m]> To even share the LO between the 2 internal channels, that is required. If you just set LO export , it can’t get out of the port.

[07:29:20] <muaddib[m]>  How big is the experimental aperture?
[07:30:57] <patchvonbraun[m]> 6ft is tiny compared to most radio astronomy antennas. I’m thinking about 5ft in one dimension and about 1ft in the other.
[07:31:47] <patchvonbraun[m]> There’ll be 4 such antennas spread over a 40ish meter baseline. Because mixed units are best units.
[07:34:38] <muaddib[m]> Each one goes to an input to the twinRX’s?
[07:36:41] <patchvonbraun[m]> Indeed. So produces six baselines at a time. A field can be imaged in about 3 or 3 days. Only good for bright sources due to the limited individual antenna aperture. But if I it works it’ll be the coolest thing ever done with an amateur-scale effort.

[22:59:18] <RyanVolz[m]> jeija: It's still a work in progress, but I just got the osmosdr and iridium packages to compile against 3.10 on all platforms including Windows. I added a patch to 3.10 last night that helps make it work with no changes to the OOTs, so if you haven't tried it today with 3.10.0.0 build 1 (as opposed to build 0, and different from 3.10.1.0 which is still building) then give that a shot!
[23:01:57] <jeija[m]> That's great to hear, Ryan Volz  (thanks for taking care of the GNURadio Conda builds by the way, very helpful!). Up until this point, I was able to compile my OOTs, but I always got an error along the lines of "ImportError: generic_type: [some block from the module] referenced unknown base type gr::block". Do you think your patch might help?
[23:04:19] <RyanVolz[m]> No, that's probably something different. The patch in question assures that the OOTs build with C++17 which is now required for 3.10. What OOT are you building? I'll try it myself when I have some time to see if I can narrow down your error.
[23:06:49] <jeija[m]> It occurs pretty much regardless of the OOT that I am trying to build, and I have tried it on two different Windows 10 installs (one of them with GNURadio from conda-forge, one of them with GNURadio built from source). I have tested it with gr-satellites and gr-correctiq (and my own newly created OOT that I have not released publicly yet). It is always the same error, and it appears both in gnuradio-companion and in the Python REPL :/
[23:07:42] <RyanVolz[m]> It happens with gr-satellites that you build yourself, or also the one that is in conda-forge?
[23:08:16] <jeija[m]> With the one I built myself. Let me quickly test the one on conda-forge...
[23:08:41] <jeija[m]> (I also had some issues with C++17, but I changed the C++ standard in CMakeLists.txt to 17, so I don't know if that modification might be the root cause...?)
[23:11:16] <RyanVolz[m]> No, that's another way to handle what my GR 3.10 patch does. You also won't be able to get a packaged version of gr-satellites for 3.10 yet, as that's waiting for the next release. But if it was an issue still with 3.9 and you're testing that then go right ahead.
[23:13:12] <RyanVolz[m]> I could see your problem being a deficiency in the conda OOT build instructions on the wiki that doesn't happen with a conda package.
[23:13:14] <jeija[m]> Yeah, I just noticed that my GNURadio was downgraded to 3.9.5 after installing gr-satellites ;) But the ImportError is gone when running gr-satellites from conda-forge, so that's good.
[23:14:03] <jeija[m]> Let me see what happens if I compile gr-satellites myself against GNURadio 3.9.5...
[23:14:03] <RyanVolz[m]> Alright, so that does seem like there's something to fix about the build instructions. I'll try some things out.
[23:16:30] *** Quits: uros (~Thunderbi@2001:8a0:6074:ad00:bc04:8f9c:b90:b087) (Quit: uros)
[23:18:09] <jeija[m]> Okay, I just tried to compile gr-satellites myself again for GNURadio 3.9.5 and I'm getting the same error. So it is certainly possible that it is an issue with the instructions. I can confirm that the instructions work for me on Linux, but apparently not on Windows.
[23:21:37] <jeija[m]> It might also be a good idea to add a quick note regarding the CR LF line ending issue on Windows to the CondaInstall page, it took me quite some time to figure out why my python bindings were apparently always "out of date" on windows ;)
[23:21:37] <jeija[m]> (Many people will use that guide for Windows I guess, since installing via Conda is currently probably the best method for Windows)
[23:26:30] <mk[m]12> Hi, I am trying to implement an OOK modulation but the modulated signal does not look like an OOK. Please could you help me to understand what is wrong with my graph? I think it's a problem with the sample rates of my input signals. I put a sample rate of 100G on the sinusoidal source because it is this value that allows me to generate a wave with a period of 1ns.

[23:29:15] <RyanVolz[m]> jeija Oh interesting. I've never run into that because I guess I've always built from a git checkout on my Linux system mounted into the Windows VM. What do you do to fix it? I'd say that rises to the level of a GNU Radio bug that's worth filing and fixing in a proper way.
[23:33:25] <jeija[m]> Ryan Volz: For my own OOT module, I just added a .gitattributes file that looked a bit like this: https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/blob/main/.gitattributes
[23:33:25] <jeija[m]> To build OOT modules that I have no control over (e.g., gr-satellites), I disabled auto-crlf in my global git configuration: git config --global core.autocrlf false
[23:33:25] <jeija[m]> (The problem occurs when the header hash is computed, it won't match the stored one due to the inserted carriage returns)

[23:35:15] <RyanVolz[m]> Yep, gotcha. I can put a note in, but I do think it would be nice if the hash check was smarter and could ignore the line ending difference.
[23:36:16] <jeija[m]> I agree that simply ignoring line endings would be the ideal solution, but a note should be good enough for the meantime.

[23:44:35] <jeija[m]> @mk: If all you want to do is create a simple proof-of-concept without any pulse shaping, you could also just use a "Repeat" block to get the Vector Source and Signal Source signals to the same sampling rate.
