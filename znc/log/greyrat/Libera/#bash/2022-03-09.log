[00:08:51] <BSaboia> Hello. What is the default way to return an error? return 1 or return -1?
[00:09:01] <greycat> !return
[00:09:01] <greybot> Every Unix process returns an exit status code to its parent. This is an unsigned 8-bit integer, 0 to 255 inclusive, with 0 meaning "success" and 1-255 meaning "failure". A script returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless you call "exit" with an argument. Functions "return" an 8-bit status code also.

[00:42:15] <greycat> Why would your script be receiving a SIGINT?  Is a user pressing Ctrl-C in a terminal?  If they do, then the foregrounded process ALREADY GETS IT TOO, from the terminal driver.
[00:42:36] <lmat> greycat: No, the SIGINT is sent by another process.
[00:42:41] <greycat> Or are you looking to handle that intermediate portion where the process is still backgrounded?
[00:42:59] <greycat> If it's another process doing the killing, IT SHOULD NOT BE USING SIGINT.  It should be using SIGTERM.
[00:43:02] <lmat> greycat: This happens when my process (the server process and the wrapper script) should stop.

[15:15:04] <Earnest> geirha: It was an attempt to see if I could have a sleep without a long running external command, so you pay two forks instead.  I also found that this is a way to do sub-second sleeps, and it's mostly reasonable.  So you can do 0.1s with this and it results in roughly 0.106s intervals on my machine
[15:15:23] *** Joins: vishal (~vishal@fedora/vishal)
[15:15:57] <Earnest> geirha: With bash you have -t which is nice, so this was an attempt to see if posix sh could do it.  Having read timeout is quite nice though, blocking IO without timeouts can be a pain
[15:16:18] <Earnest> stty time is a 8bit int though
[15:17:20] <geirha> haven't found a reliable way to use read -t as a sleep though
[15:17:52] <Earnest> What happens?  It's something I was planning on doing when I use bash
[15:18:26] <geirha> you need to provide it an stdin that will "block" somehow
[15:18:41] <Earnest> (Sorry, no, thats a lie.  I use bash's builtin sleep if available)
[15:19:54] <Earnest> Oh are you refering to a general replacement for sleep where stdin is not necessarily controlled by you?
[15:20:16] <Earnest> If so, I wouldn't do that.  It'd be used in particular cases where it could work
[15:20:30] <geirha> I saw in the "pure bash bible" he did read -t "$n" <> <(:)  but that appears to only work on linux; probably because linux has a bit weird pipe implementation
[15:21:18] <Earnest> That's a bit unsettling because I can't see why that should work
[15:21:40] <Earnest> Linux pipes, particularly bidi are very buggy
[15:24:20] <geirha> I guess    coproc sleep { read -rt 10 ; } ; wait "$sleep_PID"   should be more reliable if you don't have an ancient bash

[17:24:57] <han-solo> it was long blog, but a good read, thought i'd give it a reread

[17:25:15] <han-solo> Earnest: ah this one. Thanks a bunch
[17:25:16] <Earnest> oop isn't a 'paradigm', it's just bad data structuring
[17:25:31] <han-solo> lmat: yeah
[17:25:41] <Earnest> lmat: Curiously there are codebases which do have high amounts of reuse, look into seL4 iirc
[17:25:48] <Earnest> One of the L4 kernels anyway
[17:27:18] <lmat> Earnest: There are excellent counterexamples. The posix/gnu toolsuites are excellent counterexamples, but they busted their ass to make the tools reusable. I'm referring generally to work I (and my colleagues) do as contractors. Fooling ourselves into thinking: "I'll create an abstract interface so that it can be reused in different circumstances" is comically tragic.
[17:27:19] <Earnest> But key thing to remember is proof doesn't compose.  So you can proof each component terminates, but that tells you nothing about whether their combinations will
[17:27:30] <lmat> Earnest: Excellent point!
[17:27:51] <Earnest> lmat: Yeah, I think in most cases people try to reuse things that shouldn't be reused and generally falls under the category of premature abstraction (or just bad abstraction)

[18:00:44] <hid3> Hello everyone. I need a bit help with escaping ' and " characters in my small script. The script itself is here: https://pastebin.com/KM0bJzEr Question: How do I launch the /opt/scripts/hostbuilder with all the arguments within a detached screen session? Note that /opt/scripts/hostbuilder script itself launches an attached screen session; I cannot modify it to start detached, as it is a tool offered via read only NFS share.
[18:00:44] <pasteban> Paste is available without ads on https://pastebin.com/raw/KM0bJzEr
[18:01:22] <hid3> so basically I need to trigger a screen via remote ssh command to launch another command which actually launches an attached screen session... :(

[18:18:44] <hid3> jelly, don't ask me :) In my personal opinion, once system gets swapping, performance degrades significantly. I was asked to assist to automate some provisioning of new systems and got the details on what parameters new systems should have.
[18:20:03] <hid3> and the `date` command is used to set the initial hostname, so that as an end result, all newly built systems are unique in terms of a hostname, more or less traceable when they were built

[18:20:45] <Soliton> konsolebox: i'd declare a function for the bash version specific part instead of checking version each iteration.

[19:17:25] <Minvera> how do I make this alias work? alias ec='emacsclient $1 & i3-msg [class="Emacs"] focus'
[19:17:34] <kurahaupo> !alias
[19:17:34] <greybot> An alias is a small in-line command name text replacement. They are not commands and cannot take arguments. Only use aliases for expanding things like default command switches: alias l='ls -l'. For everything else, use a function instead: del() { mv -i -- "$@" ~/.trash; }
[19:17:37] <Soliton> not at all.
[19:17:37] <Minvera> does it need to be a function instead?
[19:17:40] <Soliton> yes.
[19:18:01] <Soliton> with quotes around the expansions.
[19:18:06] <Minvera> !function
[19:18:06] <greybot> To define: funcname() { your code here; } ## To use: funcname arg1 arg2 ... The "function" keyword isn't portable. ## http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/CompoundCommands#Functions

[21:11:41] <unixman> I was asked by a co-worker if there is a CLI program one can feed a CIDR and get a list of all the IPs from? He's trying to create a bash script to scan all our company IP space and check for ping responses. But he doesn't want to have to hand create files with a bunch of IP addresses in them.
[21:15:24] <petemc> does the scanner not understand cidr?
[21:15:43] <petemc> nmap does
