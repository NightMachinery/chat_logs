[02:42:33] <moniker-> every website i check with chrome devtools it says no grid layout detected, why is that?
[02:42:41] <moniker-> can it be no website uses grid at all?
[02:49:24] <pavonia> What does it show for the examples on this site? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout
[02:53:53] <moniker-> it shows some grid and some flexbox layouts
[02:53:55] <moniker-> https://i.imgur.com/qsAPC7l.png
[02:54:12] <moniker-> but on other websites, not one of them has grid overlays
[02:55:56] <moniker-> either everyone is using flex or chrome layout tab is misleading
[02:56:11] <moniker-> *chrome's devtools layout tab
[02:56:13] <pavonia> In my experience flax is still much more common that grid
[02:56:33] <moniker-> ye but im talking about 99.99999999% of websites i checked
[02:56:52] <moniker-> this mozilla's webpage is the only one i can remember at the moment that showed grid in chrome's devtools
[02:57:29] <moniker-> so that's not just more common, that's like total domination of flex
[02:57:41] <moniker-> like if you check youtube... no sign of grid
[02:58:15] <moniker-> i even googled examples of websites that use grid layout, and checked them and they visually look like grid, but in devtools not one is using grid lol
[02:59:35] <moniker-> ok i realize now the first result on google search for grid layout example website doesn't say anything about css, i should have put css grid layout
[02:59:39] <moniker-> that was my bad
[03:03:03] <moniker-> alright finally found a list of such websites https://gridexamples.com/
[03:03:20] <moniker-> so devtools isn't misleading then, all websites i visit are basically flex
[03:03:26] <moniker-> that's interesting
[03:04:06] <moniker-> even those that look "grid like" (youtube for ex) are flex
[03:04:32] <moniker-> that suggests it's better to spend time learning flex than grid
[03:06:25] <FunkyBob> horses for courses
[03:09:53] <moniker-> it was throwing me off that i didn't find a single website that devtools said was using grid layout so i got worried im looking in wrong place

[03:43:14] <hmw[at]> it is not that much to learn after all
[03:43:41] <moniker-> at the same time?
[03:43:48] <hmw[at]> how long can it take
[03:43:59] <hmw[at]> a week for both, if you're slow?
[03:44:01] <moniker-> practice takes very long
[03:44:13] <moniker-> non stop stumbling on issues
[03:44:20] <hmw[at]> yeah i see
[03:44:26] <moniker-> so one at the time
[03:44:42] <hmw[at]> the issues come from bein not very well experienced, I guess. That is an issue with CSS on its own, I suppose
[03:44:58] <hmw[at]> Yeah, keep Grid in mind tho, it has a few really cool possibilities
[03:45:44] <moniker-> well i suspect if you get very good at flex learning grid will be a breeze, but now at baby steps no point spending time on it
[03:45:44] <hmw[at]> moniker-: also, I always recommend to beginners to create a collection of HTML/CSS examples that outline certain effects you managed to wrap your head around successfully. Useful for reference as well as code snippet to reuse
[03:45:59] <hmw[at]> I guess learning CSS will do that for you in general.
[03:46:11] <hmw[at]> After a while, all the new things are kind of the same, they only do different things
[03:46:22] <moniker-> that's why i was checking websites and kind of gauging but was surprised to not see grid at all
[03:46:45] <hmw[at]> If I am correct, flex has more possibilities
[03:46:58] <hmw[at]> and you can do most things that you would do with grid, in flex too
[03:47:14] <moniker-> also flex is older and better supported
[03:47:22] <hmw[at]> oh, really? Didn't know that
[03:47:37] <hmw[at]> I would have thought they are both the same "age" heheh
[03:48:03] <hmw[at]> moniker-: Are you studying or working in regards to CSS?
[03:48:09] <hmw[at]> or is it even just a hobby

[03:48:26] <moniker-> https://caniuse.com/?search=grid
[03:48:35] <moniker-> it's like a hobby that might turn into more who knows
[03:48:43] <hmw[at]> ah cool
[03:49:33] <hmw[at]> moniker-: Check out my collection of crap code. Be careful, not everything is correct on there. I just want to give you an idea, what it could look like and how it does benefit me to have this

[13:39:56] <arash> Hello, I want to edit a html code, its <p class="stock in-stock">500 G</p> the problem is it always show "G 500" in the page (i think the problem is with space), i tried <p class="stock in-stock">G 500</p> too but same result, any idea how to solve this?
[13:40:54] <oksushi> arash: please don’t cross-post
[13:42:13] <xardas> arash : paste the full code here >> https://pastebin.com/
[13:42:19] <xardas> and send us the link back
[13:42:29] <xardas> We need to see the css code
[13:43:03] <arash> xardas, https://www.wowseke.com/product/wow-eu/ and search for <p class="stock in-stock">500 G</p> in dom
[13:44:50] <oksushi> arash: .product-info p.stock {direction: ltr;}
[13:47:33] <xardas> Yea that worked
[13:47:52] <arash> how can i add it using inline css?
[13:48:13] <xardas> Go to the css file, find the .product-info p.stock class
[13:48:24] <xardas> and add it at the end
[13:48:30] <arash> i want to do it inline
[13:48:57] <oksushi> arash: <p class="stock in-stock" style=“direction: ltr;”>
[13:50:06] <arash> the problem is i can't change style to that p element, i only have access inside of that element.
[13:50:25] <arash> but maybe i should close that p tag and use a new one?

[13:50:30] <oksushi> no
[13:50:54] <arash> why not?
[13:51:06] <oksushi> because then you’d lose all of the styling
[13:51:37] <oksushi> you can add a span inside, and put the style=“” on that instead
[13:53:10] <oksushi> you’ll also need to change the ‘display’ I believe
[13:53:35] <oksushi> <span style="direction: rtl; display: inline-block">500 G</span> should do what you need
[13:53:48] <arash> fixed by using. </p><p class="stock in-stock" style="direction: ltr">%s G</p>
[13:53:51] <xardas> He already changed it
[13:54:01] <arash> thank you
[13:54:12] <xardas> I think using a span is better
[13:54:24] <xardas> Because p is a block element
[13:54:30] <xardas> span is inline
[13:55:57] <arash> it didn't solve by using span, maybe because of its parent element?!
[13:57:04] <xardas> No idea
