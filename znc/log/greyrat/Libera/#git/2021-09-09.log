[04:00:32] <ZacSharp> I don't know precisely enough how git stores it's data, but if they are all stored in one place only differentiated by their has then either git errors out or overwrites the old object
[04:00:57] <ZacSharp> if it stores them seperated by type it might work as if nothing unusual happened
[04:02:53] <BtbN> If you put that into Google, all the answers say that it's impossible with some fancy space math.

[04:05:25] <ZacSharp> the number is 16**40 btw because the hashes are apparently 40 digit hex numbers
[04:07:00] <BtbN> Under normal conditions it IS exceedingly unlikely
[04:07:29] <ZacSharp> unlikely is not impossible
[04:07:46] *** Quits: christall (~christall@dyn-4-36.myactv.net) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[04:08:51] <BtbN> You can make that argument no matter what hash algorithm git uses
[04:09:23] <ZacSharp> just because you said your search results say its impossible
[04:09:32] <BtbN> They don't.
[04:09:44] <BtbN> They just calculate that the heat death of the universe is to happen before you get lucky once
[04:10:03] <ZacSharp> > If you put that into Google, all the answers say that it's impossible with some fancy space math.
[04:10:21] <BtbN> Which is "impossible" for all intents and purposes of normal use.
[04:10:25] <ZacSharp> yeah, I don't think it will happen
[04:10:50] <BtbN> Now those answers from 2012 don't factor in the attacks to forcibly create SHA-1 collisions now
[04:10:56] <BtbN> which is why git is VERY slowly migrating away
[04:12:19] <ZacSharp> how do they even do that? Doesn't it cause problems if the hash calculated for an object changes all over sudden?
[04:12:37] <ZacSharp> that hash guy gets a lot of mentions here
[04:14:17] <BtbN> It'll be a hard migration
[04:14:24] <BtbN> a repo is either sha-1 or whatever the new algorithm is
[04:15:15] <ZacSharp> and when pushing/pulling between a new and a old repo they need to recalculate the all the hashes for the other side?
[04:15:50] <BtbN> You just can't.

[15:25:41] <makara> osse: tformat only adds a newline if it wasn't there. What I was looking for is %-B%n
[15:26:04] <makara> "If you add a - (minus sign) after % of a placeholder, all consecutive line-feeds immediately preceding the expansion are deleted if and only if the placeholder expands to an empty string."

When I do `git describe --long --always --dirty --abbrev=10` in one of them it responds with something like 0.1-325-f4e80c64880 and when I do it in the other repo I get something like b16341acd7, what do I need to do to the 2nd repo to make it behave like the first?

[20:57:58] <dermoth> hwy there... I'm quite surprised "git stash push" doesn't support --allow-empty.. simple usecase, in a function: git stash push --keep-index --allow-empty; <perform fixup>; git stash pop

[21:01:06] <scosu> Hi there, is there an elegant way to copy git notes when doing a git cherry-pick?
[21:01:13] <dermoth> I already have a one-command fixup alias, but most of the times it fails if because I have delectively added changes and forgot to stash.... I'm also wondering pretty confident the pop should never fail if fixup didn'T generate conflicts as the start index's tree will match the new HEAD's tree

[21:02:36] <dermoth> actually I can even stash after creating the fixup commit - no need to keep-index and HEAD should match in the end

[21:53:05] <Soni> does git support NULs in filenames?
[21:54:22] <imMute> definitely not
[21:54:30] <imMute> it does look like newlines are supported.
[21:54:50] <imMute> my guess is it does what linux does: any byte except NUL and / are allowed in filenames
