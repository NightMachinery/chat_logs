[04:33:25] <ano> maroon: y
[04:34:59] <maroon> what do you plan to do with this hmac digest? and have you taken steps to evade a replay attack by preventing the uid from ever repeating while the pass is in effect?
[04:42:37] <maroon> you should have some 'context' data to ensure that this protocol can't trivially create the identical hash as you could create under a different protocol, should you use hmac(key=same data=same) elsewhere
[04:42:39] <ano> maroon: plan to store it in http cookie to compare with dynamically selected/generated from db by uid on every http request: hmac( key = bcrypted_sha256_pw_in_db data = uid ) == cookie_hmac
[04:43:34] <TimMc> What's the point? What's your goal?
[04:44:14] <ano> to make sure cookie is valid for current usr pw
[04:45:07] <TimMc> This is going to be an authentication cookie?

[04:46:32] <TimMc> How does the user learn the bcrypt of the password? Do you give them the salt after they successfully log in?
[04:49:33] <ano> TimMc: not sure what u mean, uid/bcrypt(ed)_pw stored in db table, only give http cookie with result of HMAC( key=bcrypt(ed)_pw data = uid )
[04:50:40] <TimMc> bcrypt(pass) will be different each time since bcrypt creates a new random salt each time.
[04:51:11] <TimMc> oh, I see -- right, it's a cookie, the server is setting it.
[04:53:54] <TimMc> So. You store the bcrypt of the user's password on registration or password change. Then, after they log in, you take HMAC(key=sha256(bcrypt_hash), data=user_id) and set that as their auth cookie. On all subsequent requests, you recompute the SHA256 and HMAC and check equality. Is that right?

[04:57:26] <ano> TimMc: yep
[04:57:30] <TimMc> So if they change their password, their session ends; and if their cookie is stolen, their only recourse is to reset or change their password.
[04:58:24] <TimMc> I think maroon's advice of including context data is spot-on. Maybe the data looks like "auth-cookie:uid=12345" or something.
[04:59:26] *** Quits: halosghost (~halosghos@user/halosghost) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[04:59:52] <maroon> is the password going to be valid at a later session where the id could potentially be 12345 again?
[05:00:45] <TimMc> But I also think the tight coupling to the password is going to lead to a bad user experience. You could just as well store an additional randomly generated "session_hmac_key" field in the DB that is changed whenever the password changes.
[05:00:55] *** Quits: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy) (Quit: exiting 3.4)
[05:01:25] <TimMc> maroon: You mean like... if they change their password, then change it back again?
[05:01:50] <maroon> TimMc, i mean a replay attack in the future where key=same uid=same
[05:02:59] <TimMc> As in, someone captures the cookie?
[05:03:04] <TimMc> Not sure what the scenario is here.
[05:03:15] <maroon> by stating the uid is greater than 1000, this implies that it's not sequentially incrementing across a long period of time if it could be 1001
[05:04:56] <TimMc> uid is just the user ID, right? Static for any given user?
[05:05:39] <ano> uid == user id always the same for per usr, >replay attack >key=same, but pw hash salted with bcrypt on every change so it will be different even for the same plain txt pw
[05:06:50] <maroon> i forget how long a bcrypt salt is, since it uses blowfish, does that mean 64bits?
[05:06:54] <ano> my main concern if cookie stolen then is there chance that plain txt pw will be extracted with such a scheme?
[05:07:06] <maroon> or is the salt being text which makes it even shorter
[05:08:29] <maroon> if they steal the cookie, they know hmac(stuff) and uid but not sha256(bcrypt-stuff) ?
[05:09:34] <ano> maroon: y, only hmac and uid in cookie
[05:11:37] <TimMc> I'm *not* a cryptographer, but it seems very unlikely that the plaintext cookie could ever be recovered -- simply because the bcrypt is salted and the salt is not available to the attacker.
[05:11:46] <TimMc> *plaintext password
