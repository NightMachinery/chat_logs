[13:46:17] <GuiToris> !w hay is for horses
[13:46:19] <tinsoldier> hay is for horses — Phrase: 1. (sarcastic) Said as a retort to someone saying hey (any sense of the interjection), used to indicate that the speaker disapproves of the usage of the word "hey", perhaps due to a dislike of informal speech. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hay_is_for_horses
[13:46:28] <GuiToris> there you go
[13:54:37] <amigojapan> Thanks GuiToris 
[13:56:31] <amigojapan> GuiToris: let me ask another question about my grandmother. She used to say "close the lights"instead of "turn off the lights", do you think that could have been because of gas lights? Before electric lights gained force
[13:57:09] <amigojapan> We close a gas valve

[21:36:02] <blkshp> I'm sure you can look him up.
[21:36:21] <blkshp> (to be honest, I think so but not sure!)
[21:36:41] <blkshp> Also, be aware, that was rude! (In case you didn't realise!)

[21:38:16] <GuiToris> thank you for letting me know, I would have used it with confidence
[21:38:53] <blkshp> gay is just a description. There is not anything wrong with stating someone is gay or asking if they're gay. What you did was suggest that being gay was wrong.

[21:41:28] <blkshp> I mean anywhere else the comment would likely just be dismissed but, from an English POV calling someone abnormal because of their appearence is unacceptable.

[21:41:45] <GuiToris> as a matter of fact, I don't know a word that would be 'worse' than that

[21:41:59] <blkshp> wow, odd indeed.
[21:42:25] <blkshp> I may have to defer here but "gay" is not an insulting word as far as I know.
[21:42:54] <GuiToris> just out of curiosity, what is an insulting word
[21:43:02] <blkshp> "faggot"
[21:43:13] <GuiToris> oh, got it
[21:43:20] <GuiToris> I've seen American Pie

[21:44:29] <GuiToris> thank you, you may have saved me from getting a black eye
[21:45:15] <blkshp> I wouldn't recommend using that word ever. (Unless you're talking about a specific northern UK meatball with gravy (or possibly a pile or sticks)
[21:46:14] <GuiToris> I don't have a dictionary (I updated my system and now crashes) but isn't faggot the end of a cigarette?
[21:46:17] <GuiToris> !d faggot
[21:46:19] <tinsoldier> faggot — Noun: 1.  (chiefly Britain, collective) A bundle of sticks or brushwood intended to be used for fuel tied together for carrying. (Some sources specify that a faggot is tied with two bands or withes, whereas a bavin is tied with just one.), 2. (obsolete) Burdensome baggage., 3. A bundle of pieces of iron or steel cut off into suitable length <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/faggot>...

[21:46:32] <tinsoldier> s for welding., 4. (rare, dated in US) A burning or smouldering piece of firewood., — Verb: 1. Alternative form of fagot
[21:46:48] <GuiToris> I'm probably mixing it up with something
[21:46:52] <blkshp> I have never heard of it in that term. "fag" is British slang for a cigarette.
[21:47:01] <GuiToris> that's it
[21:47:01] <blkshp> I wouldn't recommend using it in the US where it isn't.

[21:50:23] <GuiToris> Member of "Culture Club", a 1980's pop group. Famous for his androgynous looks and impressive wit and sarcasm. Arrested for possession of cannabis in mid-eighties; after overcoming a heroin addiction, launched a successful solo carreer, then began work as a celebrity DJ. At current, he is still a DJ, and designs the B-Rude line of clothing.
[21:50:46] <GuiToris> I think I can say that he is kind of different from normal
[21:51:20] <GuiToris> just for a confirmation, this is the word that just came to my mind when I read it;
[21:51:45] <GuiToris> is calling someone a 'pothead' rude?
[21:52:37] <huf> a bit less rude than calling them an alcoholic, I'd say
[21:52:46] <huf> but it's not the best way to gain friends, no
[21:53:21] <GuiToris> it kind of explains why people don't like to talk to me
[21:53:29] <GuiToris> or English is just a rude language

[21:54:47] <blkshp> Cannabis user would be a polite term.
[21:55:31] <GuiToris> blkshp, you know, that would be the last thing that would come to my head in a situation :/
[21:55:48] <GuiToris> it seems there's still room for improvement
[21:55:58] <blkshp> Alcoholic, Addict, Meth user, these are not rude terms, they are descriptive terms but still not something that one would use 1. to someone that isn't that thing. 2. in a general conversation.
[21:56:27] <blkshp> For example. If i were to ask someone if they were a cannabis user, that's yes or no. If I were to ask someone if they were a pothead, that's rude.
[21:56:32] <huf> alcoholic isnt a rude word
[21:56:38] <huf> just like murderer isnt 
[21:56:44] <blkshp> Precisely.
[21:56:45] <huf> but calling someone one can be :)
[21:56:50] <blkshp> Yes.
[21:57:18] <huf> also asking them if they're a cannabis user is weird and stilted
[21:57:21] <huf> just ask if they smoke weed
[21:57:45] <GuiToris> that makes things a little bit more difficult, if I could say something, but I shouldn't do it because it's considered to be rude. It's just like wearing a straight jacket
[21:57:47] <blkshp> It all depends on the circumstances.
[21:58:12] <blkshp> Saying something to a friend, an aquaintanc, or a doctor would be different in each instance.
