[00:49:44] <b0nn> hmm when you say "Redirect after a successful POST" ... what exactly do you mean
[00:50:22] <b0nn> I mean POST is supposed to know the name of the resource that it's updating, so there's nothing new for it to be directed to
[00:50:52] <rewt> when the POST creates a new resource
[00:51:14] <b0nn> and really all I thought that you would be communicating is success or failure - I'm guessing that one or the pther pathway leads to a new endpoint to interact with?

[00:52:23] <rewt> that mozilla link says POST; the w3 link doesn't mention either
[00:52:50] <b0nn> ikke: so, that's the thing POST is supposed to be "this is the resource you told me about that I want to update" and PUT is - I have some data, and this is the resource name I want to create with it
[00:53:36] <b0nn> When the client is in charge of the name of the resource being created PUT is the correct verb to use

[00:54:53] <ikke> well, not with UUIDs

[01:13:32] <b0nn> When I tweet on twitter I send a post request, and I have no care what that tweet's resource name means until I go to find that exact tweet
[01:13:51] <b0nn> more typically I just see it in the feed
[01:14:03] <b0nn> which is part of a different request (GET)
[01:14:54] <b0nn> and that GET has no care on that exact tweets id - it just asks for "teweets this user wants to see"
[01:15:55] <b0nn> PUT would be wrong to use for the send of the tweet because the client will never be in control of the tweet id
[01:16:01] <ikke> yes
[01:16:10] <b0nn> so all the client wants is 201
[01:16:28] <b0nn> just the "Did it succeed or not" status

[01:23:56] <b0nn> In fact - with FB I think that, like IRC, the client just pops the post into the timeline, because if you refresh the page the post is in a different order (if you can find it at all)

[04:10:17] <hwrd> bookworm I guess my question is.. I'm trying to generate a QR code for a link to my site... right now, I'm serving up just on a hardcoded `localhost:8000` and I'm wondering how production code is usually run that differentiates what the mux is listening on and how I can get that FQDN across my app
[04:10:37] <hwrd> is it just driven off, say, an env variable perhaps?
[04:11:10] <bookworm> you'd simply server the client back the same host they reached your application on
[04:11:22] <bookworm> if that's localhost that's fine (it won't be in the real world)
[04:11:31] <hwrd> eh?
[04:11:31] <b0nn> I think he's writing a reverse proxy?
[04:11:44] <b0nn> trying to determine if the endpoint for the right domain is called?
[04:12:15] <hwrd> nope... I'm simply wondering, on a live system, how people configure their site to know what their domain name is
[04:12:17] <bookworm> hwrd: client connects with a Host header of X, your app has a handler that serves a QR code, by then you know what the Host header was so just serve that back
[04:12:53] <tar_xvf> hwrd: i'm pretty sure most people just write in the domain name in a config file for example
[04:12:56] <hwrd> bookworm that's not what Request.URL returns though right?
[04:13:08] <hwrd> tar_xvf okay, yeah that's what I was wondering...
[04:13:16] <Tv_> generally Host: header is nicer
[04:13:27] <b0nn> request.URL.Host
[04:13:33] <Tv_> i hate telling services their names, because that means the config isn't applicable across environments, dev/staging/production
[04:13:51] <tar_xvf> true.
[04:13:57] <Tv_> b0nn: i recall that's empty for incoming requests
[04:14:19] <tar_xvf> don't forget that for most url links you can just type "/path" and you don't need to specify your domain name
[04:14:29] <b0nn> gah, request.Host vs request.URL.Host
[04:14:32] <tar_xvf> that's how i remember it was done with Hugo, for instance
[04:14:55] <tar_xvf> in the config file there was a line where you type the domain name and that is the link if you click on the homepage link at the top of a webpage
[04:15:08] <hwrd> b0nn ahhhh request.Host. thank you
[04:15:23] <Tv_> tar_xvf: hugo is a concentration of webdev stupidities though
[04:15:28] <b0nn> That's the Host header people have been talking about
[04:15:33] <hwrd> yeah request.URL isn't guaranteed to be absolute.
[04:15:34] <foobaz> hwrd: what i do is, configure nginx to reverse proxy my go app based on the path, then use a relative path with no domain name
[04:15:36] <hwrd> that was my issue.
[04:15:37] <Tv_> tar_xvf: navbar link to front page can be just "/"
[04:15:48] <tar_xvf> yes Tv_
[04:16:04] <hwrd> foobaz you can't do that when you're generating a link that can be clicked outside the context of your application
[04:16:06] <bookworm> why would it be empty?
[04:16:06] <bookworm> else Request.Host is there too
[04:16:34] <Tv_> bookworm: because it's what's on the http request line
[04:16:40] <Tv_> use req.Host
[04:18:03] <hwrd> bookworm I dunno, but request.URL gives me "/myPath", and request.Host gives me "localhost:8000"
[04:18:03] <hwrd> and by extension request.URL.Host gives me ""
[04:18:51] <bookworm> right
[04:20:46] <hwrd> thanks for the help folks!

[04:27:15] <hwrd> you cannot have func fooBar and func FooBar?
[04:27:44] <Tv_> sure you can
[04:28:01] <hwrd> then how might you differentiate TestFooBar and TestFooBar?
[04:28:15] <Tv_> sounds like a self-inflicted problem
[04:28:18] <b0nn> You can have both *but* Test must be followed by a capital letter (and it doesn't have to be the name of the function being called/tested
[04:28:21] <hwrd> LOL
[04:28:35] <b0nn> It's just a name
[04:28:48] <hwrd> b0nn ah, didn't realize it MUST be followed by a capital.
[04:29:00] <b0nn> The convention is to use the name of the function, but it could just as easily be TestMyTripToTheRamenShop
[04:29:28] <hwrd> I guess my next question is... I get the part about testing exported functions... but don't you guys have un-exported functions in main that warrant testing too?
[04:29:53] <hwrd> doesn't even have to be in main
[04:31:14] *** Joins: KonaArctic (~KonaArcti@cpe589630c73bed-cm589630c73beb.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com)
[04:31:14] <b0nn> So, testing unexported functions should only really be done when it's difficult to get coverage of them from the exported function (IMO)
[04:31:16] <Tv_> hwrd: most of the time, i don't have to care about an implementation detail; if the public api works, the public api works
[04:31:41] <b0nn> I want to be clear -it's a subjective line, some people are adamant that unexported code be tested directly
[04:32:20] <b0nn> And on that note -> ramen shop
[04:32:36] <hwrd> in my case, I'm writing a test for an unexported function that gathers the names of files in a directory. this function is used template.ParseFiles... it's not used by a public API that I wrote...
[04:32:46] <hwrd> I should test this right?
[04:33:10] <hwrd> the only time it'd get covered is by... integration tests I guess.
[04:33:22] <hwrd> b0nn I'm jealous of your ramen shop trip. Enjoy!
