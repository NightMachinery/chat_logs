[01:04:02] <Franciman> I feel dumb to ask this
[01:04:15] <Franciman> but does the stack have particular properties
[01:04:20] <Franciman> as opposed to the heap memory
[01:04:26] <Franciman> or is it just a piece of memory like the heap
[01:04:31] <Franciman> just handled by the language runtime?
[01:05:04] <andrewrk> it's virtual memory, the same as the heap. but typically there is a special register called the "stack pointer" that the language manages for you, which points at the top of the stack
[01:05:45] <Franciman> thanks andrew
[01:06:04] <devast8a> Also generally the allocation for the stack has a special flag in the OS so it knows if you go beyond the allocation that it should automatically extend it for you.
[01:06:55] <devast8a> You can replicate it with `mmap` and the `MAP_GROWSDOWN` flag.
[01:08:12] <andrewrk> devast8a, what OS's do that? in my experience on linux, you just get segfault if you hit the guard page
[01:09:18] <andrewrk> huh the man pages for MAP_GROWSDOWN agrees with you though
[01:09:22] <andrewrk> I should experiment with this
[01:09:48] <devast8a> You might be right though, it's totally possible that people decided this was a terrible idea with large memory spaces and don't do it anymore.
[01:10:21] <ifreund> I'm pretty sure you just segfault with a stack overflow on linux if you go past the 8 MiB or whatever it is
[01:10:35] <ifreund> if it grew infinitely, runaway recursion would OOM you commonly
[01:11:14] <devast8a> Does the mapping reserve the whole 8 MiB region?
[01:13:52] <devast8a> I was under the impression that `MAP_GROWSDOWN` was still in use with a guard page wherever you want it to end. Thinking about it now though, there's no way it works this way. You might as well just reserve the whole 8 MiB region.
[01:14:26] <Franciman> basically I wanted to use a stack for my language
[01:14:29] <Franciman> to get things going faster
[01:14:38] <Franciman> but I wanted it to be as fast as a real stack
[01:15:04] <andrewrk> I think the simple answer to your question is "no there is no difference"
[01:15:22] <andrewrk> if you need a stack with a runtime known capacity, ArrayList is an excellent tool for the job
[01:15:22] <ifreund> I'm pretty sure the main stack for processes and threads doesn't come from mmap and doesn't use MAP_GROWSDOWN
[01:15:24] <Franciman> so I just allocate a huge array of u8
[01:15:34] <Franciman> and define my allocator
[01:15:48] <Franciman> yeah ok
[01:15:57] <Franciman> tomorrow will be dedicated to this experiment, thanks ^^
[01:16:04] <Franciman> well now the second problem is cache

[14:42:08] <Franciman> like in gcc you have the unlikely() builtin
[14:42:20] <Franciman> I found setCold, but it applies to functions, it seems to me
[14:45:23] <ifreund> Franciman: right, it's not currently possible to control this at sub-function granularity but there is this accepted proposal: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/5177
[14:45:55] <Franciman> I could always put the conditional in a function
[14:45:57] <Franciman> lol
[14:45:59] <Franciman> and set it cold
[14:46:05] <Franciman> does it work if the function is inline?
[14:46:09] <Franciman> btw thanks
[14:49:15] <Franciman> w-wait
[14:49:17] <Franciman> what is Zag?
[14:49:37] <Franciman> https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/5239 i was reading this and they reportedly say:
[14:49:46] <Franciman> «In the Nim sense. This'll be especially helpful when Zag comes in.»
[14:53:07] <ifreund> nothing officially afaik
[14:53:29] <ifreund> it's been floated as a name for a hypothetical post-1.0 unstable branch though
[14:53:34] <Franciman> :O
[14:53:36] <Franciman> awesome
[14:53:39] <ifreund> which I think is what that issue refers too

[16:58:44] <pkap> Is there something like `std.mem.copy` but for strings of unknown size? I allocated a bunch of memory and now I want to copy `[*:0]u8` strings in there.
[17:04:38] <ifreund> pkap: there probably should be, but there isn't yet. Either convert your 0 terminated pointers to slices and use mem.copy() or write your own thing
[17:04:55] <ifreund> but how would you know how much to allocate without knowing the length of the strings?
[17:10:12] <pkap> Couldn't you check with `std.mem.len`?
[17:13:07] <ifreund> pkap: sure, so just use that length to turn your pointers into slices 
[17:13:45] <pkap> Ok thanks I'll trye this.
[17:14:45] <ifreund> note that all mem.len() does is iterate looking for a 0
[17:16:04] <pkap> Is there maybe something like this https://github.com/JakubSzark/zig-string , but for `[*:0]` strings?
[17:16:47] *** Quits: marcj (~marc@205.175.215.25) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[17:17:27] *** cr1901_ is now known as cr1901
[17:19:32] <ifreund> don't think so, any library like that is going to store the length as well
[17:19:51] <ifreund> why do you want to use [*:0] pointers instead of slices?
[17:21:37] <pkap> I don't necessarily want to, it's just that I get [*:0] from the program I am trying to work with (river).
[17:23:09] <ifreund> heh, so it's my fault I guess
[17:23:10] <pkap> On a higher level, what I'm trying to do is to concatenate a bunch of `[*:0]` strings and send it over the wayland protocoll. Maybe I need another approach, ifreund?
[17:23:31] <ifreund> pkap: which protocol and why?
[17:24:16] <pkap> river-output-status that I extended for this purpose.
[17:25:07] <pkap> To send the names of a bunch of views to a river status client.
[17:25:40] *** Quits: Vexu (~Thunderbi@188.117.20.105) (Quit: Vexu)
[17:27:01] <ifreund> pkap: are you stuffing a bunch of strings in an wl_array? sending each string in a separate event would be more idiomatic
[17:27:46] <ifreund> (also just to warn you, I probably won't merge new river-status features, I've decided that that approach is a dead end) 
[17:30:53] <pkap> I know. I don't think this will result in something good enough to merge. It's more that I wanted to try out some zig and just needed something I could work on...
[17:31:56] <ifreund> cool, yeah playing around with stuff is a great way to learn
[17:33:30] <ifreund> I'd recommend adding two new events to the protocol then, send_view_title which has a string argument and done event that is sent after all view titles have been sent
[17:34:51] <ifreund> then emit the send_view_title event multiple times in the same order as the view_tags array
[17:36:51] <pkap> Yeah that sounds easier than sending
[17:37:51] <pkap> than sending all titles together and split them after receiving.
[17:38:22] <pkap> Thanks ifreund, I'm going for that solution.

[17:40:43] <pkap> Thanks!
[17:43:47] <pkap> So after the protocol part I was planning to build something like river-tag-overlay but in zig.

[23:30:59] <tgschultz> dfrey, how would that work? `[*:0]u8` has a length that can only be determined by finding the sentinel. `[]const u8` needs to know the length. coercion here would require the compiler to insert a hidden loop.
