[06:04:07] <themasterbuilder> Hey, would anybody happen to know how to prevent company-mode from opening a bunch of standard library header files and never closing the buffers? I think company-mode is the culprit, but I'm not totally sure.
[06:05:44] <parsnip> hmm, not sure how to figure that out. can you pastebin the "Enabled minor modes: " paragraph? I might help look for some clues.
[06:05:47] <parsnip> ,paste

[06:06:48] <themasterbuilder> sure thing, give me one second
[06:06:50] <parsnip> by the way, many emacs users don't take issue with too many extra buffers open
[06:06:58] <parsnip> iiuc
[06:07:22] <themasterbuilder> https://bpa.st/MNYA
[06:07:25] <themasterbuilder> does this work?
[06:07:48] <parsnip> right that's what i wanted to look at. you did it in like a C buffer or something?
[06:08:04] <themasterbuilder> parsnip: yeah, but, it really opens way too many header files when it's doing it's thing, I think it's possibly affecting performance but at the very least it makes navigating the buffer list more irritating
[06:08:14] <themasterbuilder> in C++-mode
[06:08:28] <parsnip> hmm, i see LSP there. but i don't know if they open extra buffers
[06:08:47] <themasterbuilder> well, the reason why I think it's company is because if I disable company then I don't see any new headers being opened
[06:09:01] <themasterbuilder> so I've been looking for some company variables and searching on ddg but to no avail
[06:09:07] <parsnip> what if you enable company and disable lsp?
[06:10:07] <parsnip> seems a little plausible that lsp-mode provides some extra buffers for company

[06:15:09] <themasterbuilder> M-x list-package, I just install stuff from there

[15:59:45] <libertyprime> let me spell it out. a language server doesnt have to be just for a programming language. you could make an LSP server that acted as a documentation and refactoring server for world languages, for example.
[15:59:48] <wasamasa> they tried writing a universal package manager in elisp
[16:00:11] <wasamasa> and in bash

[16:14:54] <aidalgol> But also why LSP?
[16:15:03] <wasamasa> double the challenge, double the fun/frustration
[16:15:12] <repetitivestrain> also that, too, but i'd say just the frustration
[16:15:14] <libertyprime> because it would mean pen.el would be connected to basically every editor and future uses of lsp
[16:15:24] <wasamasa> frustration and fun are deeply intertwined
[16:15:26] <wasamasa> lol

[16:15:49] <repetitivestrain> but, let's get back to a fun topic
[16:15:53] <wasamasa> yeah
[16:16:04] <wasamasa> I sometimes do challenging projects in elisp for the heck of it
[16:16:07] <gabin> a frustrating topic?
[16:16:07] <libertyprime> lsp is literally meant to map servers to editors. i dont see what is so hard to understand
[16:16:11] <wasamasa> implementing LSP doesn't seem worth it
[16:16:34] <repetitivestrain> it's meant to map servers for analysing _code_ to editors
[16:16:38] <wasamasa> it wouldn't teach me anything new either
[16:16:55] <wasamasa> https://old.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/b3yzq4/a_lsp_client_maintainers_view_of_the_lsp_protocol/
[16:17:09] <repetitivestrain> what we really need is a viml equivalent of slynk, which will really give us the upper hand in the holy war
[16:17:10] <wasamasa> maybe someone else has an equivalent rant for servers
[16:17:30] <aidalgol> I know so many VSCode users, that I think I can safely say that no VSCode user is going to try pen.el if they can't just install it form the Extensions panel.
[16:17:37] <repetitivestrain> after all, once they can develop viml in Emacs, they will convert in no time
[16:17:51] <libertyprime> repetitivestrain: it would be useful beyond code. aidalgol: sure, problem for later
[16:18:22] <aidalgol> Nothing about LSP sounds like it is well-suited to NLP.
[16:18:27] <wasamasa> > Conclusion3: Some servers violate the protocol and this is "fine" because vscode can handle it.

[16:18:38] <wasamasa> that is one of the microsoftisms I'm wary of
[16:19:05] <libertyprime> aidalgol: you frequently say things such as: "this could never be useful". but it's giving me the impression you have a habit of underestimating technology
[16:19:27] <wasamasa> > Conclusion: It doesn't matter what's specified in the protocol documentation, but what vscode extensions are doing.
[16:19:35] <repetitivestrain> repetitivestrain: have you anything backing up your claim?
[16:19:41] <aidalgol> wasamasa: I think even if it wasn't VSCode, it would be still be some other dominant implementation that most devs only bother testing against.
[16:19:49] <repetitivestrain> according to the official documentation for the LSP, a stereotypical editing session is as follows:
[16:20:00] <repetitivestrain>  
[16:20:01] <repetitivestrain> First:  The user opens a file (referred to as a document) in the tool: The tool notifies the language server that a document is open (‘textDocument/didOpen’). From now on, the truth about the contents of the document is no longer on the file system but kept by the tool in memory. The contents now has to be synchronized between the tool and the language server.
[16:20:12] <aidalgol> libertyprime: I never meant to imply that the end result would not be useful.  It's the *implementation* that sounds unnecessarily difficult.
[16:20:18] <repetitivestrain> Second: The user makes edits: The tool notifies the server about the document change (‘textDocument/didChange’) and the language representation of the document is updated by the language server. As this happens, the language server analyses this information and notifies the tool with the detected errors and warnings (‘textDocument/publishDiagnostics’).
[16:20:28] <repetitivestrain> Third:     The user executes “Go to Definition” on a symbol of an open document: The tool sends a ‘textDocument/definition’ request with two parameters: (1) the document URI and (2) the text position from where the ‘Go to Definition’ request was initiated to the server. The server responds with the document URI and the position of the symbol’s definition inside
[16:20:28] <repetitivestrain> the document.

[16:20:42] <gabin> ,pal repetitivestrain
[16:20:43] * fsbot points and laughs at repetitivestrain. "HA-haw!"
[16:20:51] <repetitivestrain> now, how would diagnostics and 'go to definition' make sense for automatically writing in prose?
[16:21:05] <libertyprime> aidalgol: you're right, sorry
[16:21:27] <aidalgol> libertyprime: It's OK.  I'm sorry if that's what came across.
[16:22:22] <gabin> wasamasa: as a user, what is your strategy to provoke funny from judybot
[16:22:36] <wasamasa> dunno, ask the prompt engineer
[16:22:47] <wasamasa> it seems like a coin toss to me
[16:23:11] <aidalgol> wasamasa: That often, huh?
[16:23:21] <aidalgol> Feels more like a D20 roll.
[16:23:26] <wasamasa> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[16:25:13] <gabin> ask not what your country can do for you. rather, click now, you don't want to miss this deal
[16:26:05] <wasamasa> repetitivestrain: the point about the file system not being the source of truth is understandable, it helps processing the code correctly when you didn't save a buffer yet
[16:26:20] <wasamasa> repetitivestrain: but it makes things tougher for code analysis
[16:26:56] <repetitivestrain> that does have a point

[18:48:22] <krux02> (I can't read that)
[18:48:28] <tromey> this could be changed, the JS engines generally do "NaN boxing" instead of what elisp does, and so floats are direct there
[18:48:31] <corwin> that elisp is a little bit of a toy lisp tells you how gobstopping lisp is.  Like CL is a mac-truck and elisp is an F150

[18:49:19] <corwin> obligatory: https://xkcd.com/297/
[18:49:24] <tromey> instead of using low bits for tagging, you use floating point NaNs to represent pointers

[23:48:19] <twb> parsnip: RFC 3339 does not allow them to be omitted

[23:48:29] <dale> parsnip: I admit that was my next question.  I think I have a patch to allow org to repeat tasks every few minutes, since I think it only wants to repeat in days or something like that, but I thought allowing millisecond precision on something like a due date was too much, even for me.

[23:49:00] <dale> (I suppose for recording the date of the creation of a task, for example, millis is fine.)
[23:49:03] <twb> parsnip: do you also support ISO 8601 periods?
[23:49:22] <twb> parsnip: ISO 8601 weeks would also make sense to a task management tool
[23:49:24] <parsnip> like, the Taskserver will transmit milliseconds storage, but i think if CLI task edits a task, it will remove and milliseconds, so i omitted it to avoid weird updates
[23:50:02] <parsnip> um, potentially i will be considering durations later on
[23:50:12] *** Quits: specbot (~specbot@common-lisp.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:50:19] <parsnip> but that would be if i implement arbitrary user defined attributes, they can be durations

[23:52:39] <parsnip> twb: i don't think i need periods or weeks for the json format used in taskwarrior
[23:52:52] <twb> parsnip: so you can't have a recurring task?
[23:52:52] <parsnip> potentially one could do arbitrary things for UI

[23:55:59] <grym> non-lexicographic sort
[23:56:06] <rpav> ah
[23:56:11] <parsnip> for the time fields? yes, it's jsut 'yMMddTHHmmss\'Z\''
[23:56:18] <yabobay> ls can be passed the -v option

[23:56:39] <parsnip> oh, yes
[23:56:45] <twb> parsnip: the ISO 8601 notation for that should be "recur": "P3W"

[23:57:29] <twb> yabobay: ls --sort=version is GNU-specific and is not *exactly* what you wanted, but is close
[23:57:37] <twb> yabobay: sorry I didn't think of that earlier
[23:57:45] <bpalmer> yabobay: ah, I had misread the documentation. excellent you found it.

[23:59:00] <bpalmer> rudybot: command line flags should be single letter; anything else is just confusing.
[23:59:08] <rudybot> bpalmer: grep is basically two letter too, g,p are just flags
