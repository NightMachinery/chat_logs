[00:57:47] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Well `lent`/`sink` arent new they're in 1.4.0 and are just annotations for the compiler @JSONBash
[00:58:37] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> They do not prevent you from writing code, `sink` moves memory if the variable isnt used after the procedure otherwise it copies, lent returns a borrowed view unless you hold onto the object
[01:14:32] <FromDiscord> <JSONBash> so lent is like passing a pointer? assuming no mutation though?
[01:15:26] <FromDiscord> <JSONBash> and what about passing variables between threads? If i have a large seq or table (200 K) how would that work?
[01:15:52] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Well it's not lines that doesnt work it's the `open` that doesnt work
[01:16:16] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Weird
[01:16:17] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> That jumpepd
[01:16:32] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Uhh lent is the immutable version of `var` so the same logic applies
[01:17:17] <FromDiscord> <JSONBash> oh okay, that makes sense

[14:35:42] <emery> supakeen: what functions do you need? I don't trust it either and usually roll my own
[14:39:29] <PMunch> Rolling your own crypto is generally frowned upon..
[14:39:46] <PMunch> madprops, nah it looks fine. I just haven't had time to review it properly
[14:40:30] <emery> PMunch: i mean implement
[14:40:49] <PMunch> I guess more people might have some feedback on the design as well: https://github.com/PMunch/nim-playground-frontend/pull/28
[14:40:57] <supakeen> emery: the problem is that nimcrypto does roll its own for most things; i'd prefer nice bindings to openssl or nacl.
[14:41:11] <PMunch> React with a thumbs up (on the GitHub PR, not the Discord message) if you like it, or a thumbs down if you don't
[14:41:15] <supakeen> but mostly rsa/ec and aead ciphers
[14:41:27] <supakeen> luckily not much x509 ;)
[14:41:42] <emery> supakeen: well then you have to worry about openssl and nacl not linking or doing stupid things
[14:41:51] <PMunch> I mean Nim has libsodium binding
[14:42:02] <PMunch> And OpenSSL bindings
[14:42:09] <PMunch> I use the OpenSSL ones at work
[14:42:20] <supakeen> yes but there's no higher level openssl bindings (like: python cryptography style) i think?
[14:42:22] <emery> libsodium is designed to break on untest platforms, it dumb

[20:02:55] <FromDiscord> <OffenseTeacher> mhmmm
[20:03:11] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> that generally requires a different solution though, where you move common things into one file
[20:03:45] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> so some folks create like a `types` module or something then throw all the types that are shared between modules in there
[20:03:56] <FromDiscord> <auxym> re: forward declarations and cyclic imports, there is also this that is upcoming: https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/18818 but not for 1.6 I think?
[20:04:03] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> I generally just put all the code in one module since having a file with solely types in it is kind of pointless
[20:04:47] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> Really? The most important feature?
[20:05:19] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> I beg to differ but, yeah it will be cool to have it. I have no clue on the timeline @auxym

[20:07:40] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> I think better C++ interop is the most important featurre
[20:07:43] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> (edit) "featurre" => "feature"
[20:07:49] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> but I think it also depends on what you use Nim for

[20:08:41] <FromDiscord> <auxym> When it works, I like to do ML-style modules where you define a (or a few related) types and all procs that act on these types. Then higher level business-logic modules can import those.
