[00:07:49] <e36freak> autokick at least wouldn't be a terrible idea
[00:07:53] <e36freak> 3-strike rule maybe
[00:08:04] <e36freak> don't wanna autoban someone just because they accidentally paste a bunch of text one time
[00:09:17] <earnest> I mean
[00:09:28] <earnest> Would that be such a terrible loss
[00:10:01] <e36freak> i'm not for punishing noobs for a simple one-time mistake
[00:10:10] <e36freak> 3 times? sure, ban
[00:10:12] <tk> so the way candide does this is auto-ban for a minute if someone spams
[00:10:18] <e36freak> also an option
[00:10:22] <tk> in #c just now, dark0 got auto-banned and then left before being unbanned
[00:10:29] <tk> so clearly, low effort
[00:10:39] <e36freak> heh
[00:11:42] <yitz> Is there an easy way to detect how many users match *mobile.abo.orange.fr?
[00:12:21] <e36freak> oh man
[00:12:33] <earnest> Ban all of orange.fr lol
[00:12:47] <earnest> The only way to be sure
[00:12:53] <yitz> Can do!
[00:13:43] <e36freak> i wonder if irssi can dump /names output to file. gotta be a way
[00:14:11] <e36freak> oh but that's not hostmasks
[00:14:28] <earnest> tk: To be fair, candide is a pretty high standard to follow
[00:15:02] <tk> I wouldn't say so, have you read the code? in any case, it's not exactly rocket-science to reimplement that one feature.
[00:15:06] <e36freak> i mean that in itself is not hard to implement
[00:15:09] <e36freak> yeah
[00:15:18] <tk> candide is big, but even pragma- says it's crap

[00:17:13] <e36freak> tk: the JIT stuff it does is pretty swanky
[00:17:27] <tk> jit stuff? you mean the compiler vm?
[00:17:32] <e36freak> yitz: doesn't even have to be the same message, usually just user posts X times in Y seconds
[00:17:35] <e36freak> tk: yeah
[00:17:44] <tk> # ls
[00:17:45] <shbot> tk: no output
[00:17:47] <e36freak> guess it's not exactly JIT but it's handy
[00:17:49] <tk> shbot
[00:17:56] <tk> shbot's vm stuff is nicer in my opinion
[00:18:00] <e36freak> sure, there's shbot, but it's not compiling
[00:18:08] <tk> the vm is lightweight, it's actually just an initramfs
[00:18:16] <tk> candide spins up a full ubuntu
[00:18:46] <tk> which has its advantages but the disadvantage is I haven't found a VM provider of a cheap vm which would allow enough RAM to actually spin up an ubuntu VM (and obviously containerisation is out of the question given the potential security implications)

[00:19:15] <e36freak> right, that was my thought
[00:19:25] <e36freak> kick, do it 2 or 3 times and then it's a ban
[00:19:40] <e36freak> but at least there's a warning
[00:20:01] <e36freak> could also make it a ban if it is the same thing over and over

[10:09:56] <Blondie101010> guest91:  instead of `while [ "$response" != 'y' -a "$response" != 'n' ]`, you could: while [[ "$response" != 'y' ]] && [[ "$response" != 'n' ]]

[10:58:52] <Lope> Hey guys, I've got an initramfs script that's been working fine for months. But it's not been working properly so I got into the initramfs environment to check it out.
[10:59:17] <Lope> I see one issue, it said: line 25: disown: not found
[10:59:35] <Lope> Specifically, what that's referring to is the following 2 lines:
[11:00:15] <llua> your initramfs uses dash now
[11:00:40] <Lope> llua, holy shit?
[11:00:46] <Lope> when did that change?
[11:00:52] <llua> how would i know?
[11:01:14] <Lope> is sh dash or bourne? I can never remember
[11:01:32] *** Quits: lsrtl__ (~lsrtl@user/lsrtl) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[11:01:39] <llua> it depends on the os
[11:02:05] <llua> but you will most likely never see a bourne shell
[11:02:09] <Lope> bullseye
[11:02:26] <Lope> debian 11 bullseye
[11:02:46] <Lope> /usr/bin/nohup bash -c 'sleep 1; rm /tmp/cleanup.sh' >/dev/null 2>&1 &
[11:02:48] <Lope> disown
[11:03:04] <Lope> so that's the disown line where it's saying "line 25: disown: not found"
[11:03:18] <llua> because dash doesn't have a disown builtin
[11:03:19] <Lope> but what's weird is if I run the script manually now, it runs just fine
[11:03:32] <Lope> oh, so I'm running it now with bash.
[11:03:38] <Lope> so that's why it's working.
[11:03:44] <xx> try `dash /path/to/script` then
[11:03:57] <xx> or even `sh /path/to/script`
[11:04:08] <Lope> can't find dash
[11:04:08] <xx> both will show you that it doesn't work
[11:04:12] <Lope> ok will try sh
[11:04:20] <xx> can't find dash?? On debian? No way
[11:04:21] <Blondie101010> lope why do you run `disown` after starting the cleanup with nohup?
[11:04:28] <Lope> ok sh gives me the disown not found thing.
[11:04:33] *** Quits: skapate (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[11:04:43] <Lope> Blondie101010, because I want the script to end
[11:05:19] <Blondie101010> disown want make a difference unless you skipped what would affect it
[11:05:30] <Blondie101010> *won't
[11:06:02] <Lope> basically by doing the nohup dev null output ampersand thing and then disown
[11:06:10] <Blondie101010> nohup includes all of disown's functionality
[11:06:12] <Lope> it means that command is fully run in the background
[11:06:17] <Lope> so the current script can end.
[11:06:23] <Blondie101010> your disown is not needed
[11:06:26] <Blondie101010> no
[11:06:38] <Blondie101010> just test it out with a longer sleep
[11:06:52] <Blondie101010> it won't matter
[11:06:53] <Lope> previously I found disown was necessary to fully allow the current script end.
[11:06:59] <Blondie101010> no
[11:07:03] <Lope> or at least that's what I concluded when I made it.
[11:07:19] <Blondie101010> well just remove it
[11:07:31] <Lope> ok will try
[11:08:32] <xx> Lope: and really try to find the cause of "can't find dash" because that's an essential package on debian
[11:09:48] <Lope> Blondie101010, I see you're right
[11:10:06] <Lope> xx, well I'm in the initramfs environment
[11:10:15] <Lope> which dash doesn't find dash
[11:10:31] <xx> but you said you have bash available there, which is odd too
[11:10:34] <Lope> but I didn't install dash in my initramfs script
[11:10:42] <Lope> I told it to install bash though
[11:10:47] <xx> oh ok then
[11:10:48] <Lope> so I'll add dash to the list.
[11:11:14] <Blondie101010> sh --version
[11:11:28] <Lope> will check, I just rebooted.
[11:11:41] <Lope> want to modify my initramfs install script.

[15:04:11] <earnest> They're not going to discuss multibyte for every tool, they'll do it one place.  Hopefully the presence of -b makes this clear to you
[15:05:32] <earnest> (But yes, POSIX defines locale and the need for multi-byte support)
[15:05:47] <Grems> It does not. But I'm guessing this is close to what you're referring to: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html#tag_12_02

[15:06:11] <earnest> I'm not interested in debating facts with someone who is asking for help
[15:06:28] <Grems> And `fold` mentions LC_CTYPE to determine locale
[15:06:53] <Grems> "It does not" was in reference to "Hopefully the presence of -b makes this clear to you"
[15:10:33] <Grems> earnest: So the presence of "-b", did not make clear to me that they're going to discuss multibyte in one place, as opposed to for every tool. =)

[20:35:32] <dob1> and I was sure that with/without export was a important difference like 20 min ago
[20:35:58] <Blondie101010> if scriptA.sh includes `source scriptB.sh`, it will see all the variables scriptB.sh defines, and export directives it includes
[20:36:06] <Blondie101010> it is run in the same shell

[20:41:25] <greybot> The environment comprises the subset of variables that are exported, either permanently by the "export" statement or temporarily by prefix assignment.

All other variable names should be lowercase.

[23:11:35] <parst> Hello, I have a file with 3 lines in it.  I would like to transform in into a single line string of `line1\nline2\nline3`.  I am trying `tr "\n" "\\\n" < lines` which is giving me `line1\line2\line3\` -- it does not have the `\n`, only `\`.  what is the way that I can do this so it has the printed `\n` in the string?
[23:13:18] <phy1729> tr replaces one character with another. Just one though
[23:13:37] <twkm> you don't seem to know what tr does.  the file is already that form, might as well just read the whole thing.
[23:14:05] <Soliton> if you have GNU sed you can do: sed -z 's/\n/\\n/g'
[23:15:33] <parst> thanks this is helpful!  I am trying to store a multiline string in an environment variable, preserving the newlines
[23:15:52] <Soliton> why not leave the newlines alone then?
[23:16:24] <phy1729> awk '{ a = a $0 "\\n" }; END { print a; }'     I think is POSIX

[23:16:48] <earnest> parst: environment variables can contain newlines
[23:18:25] <parst> yeah this is kind of a workaround for a dotenv file format that doesnt handle multiline variables. so needs to be represented as a single line with literal `\n`
[23:19:06] <earnest> parst: And what if it contains '\n' as a value?
[23:19:39] <parst> no idea.  haven't gotten that far yet.
[23:20:45] <Soliton> you need to double backslashes as well if you want to make it robust.
