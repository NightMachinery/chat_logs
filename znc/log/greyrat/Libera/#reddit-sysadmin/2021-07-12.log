[13:53:36] <sd> 14<X​eLaD> Morning guys, looking for some advice. At the moment we are in the process of having some bespoke software written for us (we are about 3 years in). The system is finally approaching the point where we are looking to make the "complete" move to it and make our old system redundant.
[13:53:36] <sd> 14<X​eLaD> 
[13:53:36] <sd> 14<X​eLaD> The system is fairly complex now, i believe its written in VB .NET and SQL Backend - Some aspects of it are incredibly slow (Opening Quotes, Sales Orders etc).
[13:53:37] <sd> 14<X​eLaD> 
[13:53:37] <sd> 14<X​eLaD> I've spoken to the company a couple of times to try and see what can be done about it, and i think they are hesitant to offer any suggestions in case it does not work.

[13:54:57] *** Joins: Rpifan (~Rpifan@user/rpifan)
[13:56:10] <Oliber> uh, are they able to reproduce the problem on a test config? from a 1000yard guess it may be either a badly constructed query or missing indexes
[13:58:16] *** Joins: pgp (~pgp@88.157.222.244)
[13:59:46] <sd> 14<X​eLaD> I wont lie its a pretty complex system in terms of what processing its doing, there are lots of validation and checks done on each item in a quote upon opening. Im guess im just looking to see what are the obvious aspects of hardware to check in terms of I/O Speeds when working with SQL Server. As thats the only thing i really have much power over.
[14:00:20] <sd> 14<X​eLaD> But we have moved from a fairly responsive Access System, to a system which can take 15 - 20 seconds to open a quote or order
[14:00:27] <sd> 14<X​eLaD> and its the first thing people complain about
[14:03:56] <xe0n> why do you think its hardware related? could be software too lol
[14:04:22] <Oliber> I found engage the skills of a DBA or software developer who understands the data and structure
[14:04:26] <xe0n> what troubleshooting and tests have you completed? have been able to do some isolated tests?
[14:04:33] <xe0n> or speak with the developers, they're the ones who understand
[14:04:44] <xe0n> you need to express your problems to them, they're the ones who can fix it..
[14:05:20] <xe0n> a random database admin and software dev aint going to be able to solve something like this, the people writing the application can
[14:05:23] <Oliber> you might be able to steer them in the right direction by identifying the slow performing query (which they should be able to do anyway), i think this guide is still reasonable - https://redmondmag.com/articles/2013/12/11/slow-running-sql-queries.aspx
[14:06:12] <Oliber> we've had queries go from taking 3-5mins to fractions of a second because indicies were missing, the hardware configuration stayed exactly the same
[14:06:15] <xe0n> ...just speak with the developers who write the software, they're the ones who will have some troubleshooting experienece with it, and can run tests

[22:04:53] <DrZak> ye
[22:04:53] <mistiry> "hey, great job catching that, have a choclate bar"
[22:04:55] <mistiry> BOOM 
[22:04:59] <mistiry> they are in a good mood
[22:05:03] <gibby> fuck you PublicWiFi. there is your pep talk for the day. 
[22:05:07] <mistiry> and you are on their "people i like" list
[22:05:08] <gibby> <3
[22:05:11] <PublicWiFi> good impression of my dad
[22:05:13] <PublicWiFi> spot on
[22:05:19] <gibby> I'll be here all week
[22:05:22] <PublicWiFi> xD
[22:05:32] <DrZak> if somebody compliments an action comparable to 'hey timmy, you are 5 now and its so great you dont eat mud anymore' i get twitchy
[22:05:35] <gibby> after that, going for smokes and never coming back
[22:06:08] <PublicWiFi> yall wanna help me try to convince my c-levels to use smart cards for 2FA onprem despite the inconvenience
[22:06:16] <DrZak> (do kids generally still eat mud at 5?, i have no clue actually)
[22:06:37] <gibby> PublicWiFi: point to any ransomware attack in the last year and say 2FA would have prevented it
[22:06:41] <eddiejennings> PublicWiFi: simulate a ransomware attack
[22:06:49] <gibby> or get an assessment done that will show that
[22:06:56] <mistiry> PublicWiFi: why smartcard over another option?
[22:07:00] <PublicWiFi> eddiejennings: actually just downloaded knowbe4's simulator i just gotta whitelist it
[22:07:01] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol DrZak
[22:07:08] <AnonymooseReddtr> DrZak my kid eats poop and he's 3 lol

[22:10:06] <sintax> physical RSA tokens are about $30 each

[23:16:27] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> sounds like they just try to apply the same policies at all sites, regardless of the conditions
[23:16:50] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> if it's not an actual prison, or some other property where inmates are in contact with employees, I don't see why there's a need to search anything
[23:17:27] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> I'd never work for such a company, but if my employer ever said they wanted to search my vehicle I'd tell them to go fuck themselves
