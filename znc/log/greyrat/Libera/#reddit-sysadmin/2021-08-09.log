[07:45:58] <catbeard> right
[07:46:04] <catbeard> hence dns cache and root hints
[07:46:13] <catbeard> provided by your ISP's resolvers
[07:46:21] <catbeard> if not 1.1.1.1 etc
[07:48:21] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Ok so root hints do that for us
[07:49:35] <catbeard> they do a large portion of the expensive queries - https://www.internic.net/domain/named.root
[07:49:45] <catbeard> e.g. the `.` namespace
[07:49:47] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> root servers are authoritative
[07:50:15] <catbeard> they're authoritative for `.` zones
[07:50:26] <catbeard> e.g. `com.`, `net.`
[07:50:29] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Which is the entire domain namespace
[07:50:33] <catbeard> yeah
[07:50:38] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> all TLDs
[07:50:43] <catbeard> yes
[07:51:15] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> authoritative in the sense that they'd tell you where you should go to next
[07:51:50] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Just trying to see if this entire process can be made more efficient
[07:51:54] <catbeard> yep it gives you a referral to the correct namespace from the rightmost portion
[07:51:59] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> or simplified
[07:52:06] <catbeard> e.g. you'd get a referral to the SOA/NS of com.
[07:52:13] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> yes
[07:52:15] <xe0n> <+sd> <s​ysadmin> Just trying to see if this entire process can be made more efficient
[07:52:18] <xe0n> what process, DNS?
[07:52:19] <catbeard> then com. NS would give you a referral to microsoft.com
[07:52:28] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> yes xe0n DNS
[07:52:33] <catbeard> or rather to microsoft.com's NS
[07:52:37] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> yes
[07:52:47] <xe0n> sorry, so how do you think you could change how DNS works?
[07:52:55] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> And that would tell me the records for that domain
[07:52:56] <xe0n> i'm confused at what you're trying to acheive, just learn how DNS works?

[07:56:12] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Just had a question on the dig command
[07:56:29] <catbeard> i'm actually not sure how RTL domain root namespacing works, maybe just the positions are reversed, e.g. com.[arabic-characters]
[07:56:54] <catbeard> and maybe a different named.root for RTL
[07:56:58] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> i mean that accounts for very little DNS traffic
[07:57:04] <catbeard> how do you know
[07:57:05] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> All things considered
[07:57:21] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> I don't know... I just think it does

[11:06:37] <DrZak> i have just pitched a glass blocks fence to a colleague and he's doing it
[11:06:50] <DrZak> 15 x 1,5m of glass fence
[11:06:51] <DrZak> :DDD
[11:06:57] <DrZak> it will be supercool
[11:07:19] <jay-ros> glass blocks AS the fence?
[11:07:27] <DrZak> yea
[11:07:30] <jay-ros> like, glass brick kinds of dudes with silicone?
[11:07:39] <jay-ros> or glass pool fencing?
[11:08:01] <DrZak> yea, this - https://wpe.4feldco.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/glass-block-windows.jpg
[11:08:11] <jay-ros> oh sick
[11:08:13] <jay-ros> I like them
[11:08:23] <DrZak> i dont think its silicon in the gaps
[11:08:30] <DrZak> tbh. i dont know what is used to join them
[11:09:05] <jay-ros> it'll be an acrylic latex of some sort
[11:09:05] <JollyRgrs> pretty much it is clear silicon, iirc
[11:09:23] <JollyRgrs> yeah, not like counter-top caulking, but something similar
[11:09:38] <JollyRgrs> DrZak: so this is between your cubes? or...?
[11:09:40] <jay-ros> I think it's an epoxy too
[11:09:46] <jay-ros> or similar
[11:10:09] <jay-ros> :) JollyRgrs I like that we're both like "It's similar to this but not quite"
[11:10:10] <DrZak> noo, at his house, one part would be too dark if he put regular fence up
[11:10:21] <DrZak> so, this will give him the privacy yet allow for light
[11:10:56] <JollyRgrs> jay-ros: ikr? i'm too far removed from that stuff to know better right now
[11:11:15] <JollyRgrs> DrZak: depending on what he's wanting to do... if you put your eye up to it, you can still kinda see through a bit
[11:11:31] <JollyRgrs> like if you plan to nude around and there's little kids next door kinda thing.... still gotta be careful
[11:11:41] <DrZak> there are dozens of diffussion levels, so depends which one he goes for
[11:11:44] <JollyRgrs> also depends on the kind of block you get
[11:11:46] <JollyRgrs> yeah
[11:11:49] <jay-ros> warn the neighbours in advance
[11:12:04] <jay-ros> "hey, just letting you know I'll be swingin' near the fence, might wanna keep the kids away from it"
[11:12:11] <JollyRgrs> "i'm going nudies and i'm putting in a "channel 99" window in the fence"
[11:12:24] <JollyRgrs> did y'all have the fuzzed out channel 99 in AUS?
[11:12:36] <DrZak> he is a passionat saussage maker, he habitually greets them in a bloody apron
[11:12:36] <jay-ros> turns out it's only 2 foot high, and doesn't cover anything
[11:12:39] <DrZak> :)
[11:12:42] <JollyRgrs> old school channel 98 and 99 were adult PPV channels... they were scrambled, but you could sometimes make a part of it out
[11:13:19] <DrZak> why would two people have the same tv channels mapped to the same numbers?
[11:13:25] <jay-ros> 2 hours apart
[11:13:30] <JollyRgrs> DrZak: ?
[11:13:45] <JollyRgrs> b/c back in the day, there weren't 3 digita channels?
[11:14:07] <JollyRgrs> and the last 2 at the end might be used by more than 1 carrier for this. in US, most cable TV carriers did this on channels 98 and 99
[11:14:54] <JollyRgrs> and it was just PPV porn, not really "channels"... but there wasn't "on-demand" at the time, so you'd just pay for whatever was currently going I guess (i dunno, I was too young to call the cable company and ask)

Errors not pop up every timne when I am opening the file, as well font which it displaying an error is already in the system
[13:58:29] <sd> 02<P​arker> any ideas
[13:59:25] <Kiernian> someone forgot to hit "embed fonts" when they generated it and you don't have the requisite fonts installed on your machine. Your options are: 1- get them to send a copy with the fonts embedded, 2- figure out what fonts they are and download them.
[13:59:42] <sd> 14<X​eLaD> Im pretty sure you can turn off the warning too, that it cant find the font
[14:00:40] <Kiernian> i vaguely recall once seeing an option to use the default font for any non-existent non-embedded fonts, but I don't remember what piece of pdf software that was on or when.
[14:00:56] <sd> 02<P​arker> yes, but I got new document recently where they said font is embeded
[14:01:07] <sd> 02<P​arker> is there a way to check which font has been embeded ?
[14:01:29] <sd> 02<P​arker> and any idea about second error   Error 2. - drawing error occured
[14:01:43] <sd> 14<X​eLaD> Is it a CAD Drawoing?
[14:02:49] <sd> 02<P​arker> you mean document was created from CAD ? nope it was converted from Word
[14:03:15] <sd> 14<X​eLaD> Pretty weird, i wonder what software they used to export it
[14:03:25] <sd> 14<X​eLaD> Like Windows PDF etc
[14:04:24] <sd> 02<P​arker> I checked in document properties so it is showing as Microsoft Word for Microsoft 365
[14:04:29] <sd> 02<P​arker> so it is decent version

[14:20:57] <Kiernian> what are you using to *open* the pdf? because if it's edge, or any kind of default preview on windows 8+/10, use something else.

[14:29:29] <Kiernian> yeah. generally if something's throwing errors on opening a pdf my first solution is try opening it with another tool, second is try generating it with another tool. Third usually involves calling anyone who insists on using pdf format a tool under my breath.

[20:27:20] <vinrock> thats a problem with large arrays of spinny disks
[20:27:36] <vinrock> if they werent staggered when one fails the others are near the end also and the rebuild pushes them over
[20:27:37] <csws> 40 x 2TB disks
[20:27:56] <csws> it's raid10 so at least the rebuild is only straining one other disk

[20:44:36] <rpifan> its sorta like a lord of the rings light

[20:44:43] <vinrock> quality and value wise

[20:45:04] <rpifan> germans are unreliable
[20:45:04] <vinrock> oh theyre good
[20:45:13] <vinrock> nothing special you just gotta stay on top of maintenance
[20:45:14] <rpifan> you cant depend on them for nothing
[20:45:15] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> what brand are they?

[20:47:44] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> why detuned?
