[18:07:47] <Togra> so I've got firefox set up on a rasbperry pi in kiosk mode with no mouse or keyboard, it sits there showing me the stuff all day every day and it works great. but now there's been two VPN ads that have come on top of it and the only easy way for me to get them to go away is first to notice it before I maaaybe get burn in? and then reboot the rpi
[18:08:02] <Togra> can I prevent these ads somehow? I'm not opening a new tab, it's sitting on the same old page it always sits on but still has this ad come up
[18:08:04] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[18:08:58] <Togra> looking closer it looks like this morning was its scheduled weekly reboot, so it probably is coming up as soon as the browser loads, but I want it to go to its designated home page without any ads inbetween, this has been working fine for years and now without any config changes it doesn't anymore, can I revert it somehow or block the ads?
[18:10:00] <Togra> I understand this is an uncommon and not even necessarily intended usecase, but.. worked fine for years up until now
[18:10:04] <Togra> maybe five years or so

[19:07:03] <Guest94> for the love of god please put the right click print option back in ..pretty pretty please
[19:15:12] <Timvde> I didn't even realise it ever existed, why would you right click for printing? That makes no sense to me o_o
[19:15:38] <Togra> I could see that being handy sometimes, I didn't personally use it.. maybe there's an add-on for that?
[19:15:56] <Togra> that seems like something that would be missed by a handful of people who'd use it, and one of the people who'd miss it would remake their own after it went away
[19:15:59] <Timvde> Why would right click be more useful than just use the menu (or ctrl-p for that matter)?
[19:16:17] <Togra> oh, well if it did the exact same thing then I can see why it'd go away :<
[19:16:50] <Timvde> There's this extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/print-print-preview-context/
[19:17:12] <Togra> oh that sounds like it does it
