[01:38:10] <LjL> no
[01:38:19] <LjL> but you may not get it, either
[01:39:51] <LjL> the tenses seem generally off to me
[01:40:11] <LjL> "was buying"? "maybe he was to cook"?
[01:40:37] <LjL> aside from that, "he studied at a well-known university" is what i'd say, not "in"
[01:41:29] <LjL> "first I'm turning on... and now I'm cleaning" and all those sequential progressives also sounds off to me
[01:42:10] <LjL> "After a few minutes everything must be added onto the pan, stir and add the pasta" ← can't have passive and active voices in sequence like that with a surprice change of subject
[01:42:34] <LjL> then direct quotes should be in quotes

[01:44:14] <LjL> "the next day..., so much so..., since there was..., he accepted the offer" there is at least one serial comma that's worse than your average serial comma there... make the thing before the "since" a semicolon
[01:44:41] <LjL> "working what he likes" with working being transitive sounds either wrong or way too colloquial to fit within the rest
[01:45:05] <LjL> anyway those aren't huge things but maybe especially due to the tenses, it does sound very... translated

[01:57:57] <LjL> and progressive forms (is -ing, was -ing) can sometimes be used for repeated actions, but in a narrow set of circumstances, and mostly they refer to actual progressive actions
