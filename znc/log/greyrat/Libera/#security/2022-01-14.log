[03:05:49] <Guest18> ajak unless its a harware issue, which its not because im on the box now, i dont understand how the network would fail. No issues on the router, other devices were still connected. when i ran nm-connection-editor i noticed a bridge that was pointed at an ip my routr dcoesnt assign in that range. Maybe its the network card? i deccided to remove it

[12:57:33] <structoha> aswell
[12:57:35] <Apachez> its often those things that break things
[12:57:43] <Apachez> so you got a nice firewall and dmz etc
[12:57:59] <Apachez> then your users connect to some external server and download malware anyway and happily execute it
[12:58:11] <Apachez> one way to segment that is to use a vm (in a dmz) to do the external stuff
[12:58:47] <Apachez> this way if something downloaded from nextcloud is malware your vm will restart every day so the malware will not live for long and it wont be able to access your internal secrets
[12:59:07] <structoha> Fair enough
[12:59:12] *** Joins: horseface (~horseface@user/horseface)
[12:59:29] <structoha> But that means the vm can inspect the ssl-encrypted content?
[12:59:43] <Apachez> usually you want to do that in the firewall
[13:00:06] <structoha> Why should i be able to see the ssl-encyrpted traffic, doesnt that violate the privacy of the developer?
[13:00:07] <Apachez> so the vm or user have one ssl session thats terminates by the firewall and then its the firewall who have another ssl session towards destination
[13:00:12] <Apachez> nope

[13:01:39] <structoha> I am thinking now about that VM, it could be a debian-based distro with opnsense?
[13:01:49] <Apachez> no
[13:01:52] <Apachez> I meant as a vm guest
[13:02:00] <ostkind> no
[13:02:05] <Apachez> example (there are plenty of designs and considirations)

[13:03:00] <ostkind> exactly, i can make all to admins nd i would have better controll.
[13:03:05] <Apachez> they then sit on internal network and connect to the vm like    client -> opnsense -> vm-guest

[13:14:38] <ostkind> we had ppl na, company, putting their shit backup cloud and got hacked thru.
[13:14:51] <structoha> Oh
[13:15:11] <ostkind> you will never know
[13:15:54] <structoha> I have gitlab repo hosted on hetzner cloud, accesses through a website (https). Does a reverse proxy help me in this case?
[13:16:12] <structoha> to increase security
[13:16:41] <ostkind> my tutor said give all related shit to third party then they have to pay. thats not abot securty
[13:17:01] <structoha> hmmmm
[13:17:17] <ajak> structoha: do you think it would?

[13:17:26] <ostkind> wer ist dann schuld
[13:17:50] <ostkind> money
[13:19:20] <structoha> I don't understand how a reverse proxy increases security when intercepting requests
[13:19:37] <structoha> currently, i have a gitlab running on nginx
[13:20:21] <ostkind> mm. i am doing this job for more then 30 years. stuck. blyat. i want to go back to the sea...

[13:21:35] <`Tim> if you just pass everything, then that's what you're doing

[13:24:21] <ostkind> bout one proxy.. do you think hen i drop i can get your ip?
[13:24:25] <`Tim> what are you protecting against

[13:24:50] <structoha> nothing else
[13:24:56] <`Tim> that's what you are protecting
[13:25:04] <`Tim> i'm asking what you are protecting against
[13:25:27] <ostkind> .git
[13:25:51] <`Tim> what kind of threats are you looking at
[13:26:09] <structoha> Against any attack that get control over the nginx server or the gitlab login page
[13:27:37] <structoha> to be honest i am new to this, i looked up how to harden nginx but other than that i dont know what what to do more to harden a gitlab web page

[13:28:16] <ostkind> so we did
[13:28:53] <`Tim> well, if it's about exploiting gitlab to take control of the server for example; you could use a mandatory control system like selinux or apparmor; or putting gitlab into a container

[13:29:33] <ostkind> install an eggdrop usung tail and you can see what happens
[13:29:50] <ostkind> easy
[13:30:09] <`Tim> you can't really protect against bugs in the application per se
[13:30:34] <ostkind> docker. one breakout too
[13:30:50] <structoha> ostkind: ill take that in consideration
[13:30:54] <`Tim> you can limit damage when it happens; and you can reduce the attack surface; for example if you are the only user you could easily do some geoblocking on either the firewall or the reverse proxy
[13:31:10] <structoha> `Tim: never worked with containers :) ill give it a try, currently learning ansible too much for me :O
[13:31:12] <`Tim> same for ssh when you're at it

[13:33:57] <structoha> we currently have no time to setup a home server for all that
[13:33:58] <ajak> ok so it's self hosted on hardware someone else owns, and i have the same question
[13:34:03] <ostkind> i hacked s4y once
[13:34:16] <structoha> we currently have nothing serious on the cloud, we are experimenting
[13:34:24] <ostkind> all domains
[13:34:35] <`Tim> essentially the question would be, why not use the public github or gitlab hosting; they too have privat repos if that is what you need
[13:34:50] <`Tim> or some simpler hosting system locally
[13:35:16] <structoha> i cant host locally

[17:34:30] <B4ckBOne> Joanna gotoassist is such a website. Then there is also the whole OneClick .net eccosystem.
[17:35:11] <Joanna> I had the setting for pop ups blocked in browser

[17:36:23] <Joanna> It sure was annoying.
[17:37:01] <B4ckBOne> Most popups are. Some dont even pop up a new window or tab. They just put another layer over the already displayed website.

[17:51:24] <Joanna> There seem to be a lot of paid trolls and spammers in irc as if they want to make people stop using it.

[22:38:40] <Evolver> Whenever I try to unlock my Android phone (when it's the first thing in the morning), the screen shuts off after I press Enter (after entering the password). This never happens again for the rest of the day. The screen doesn't unlock. I then have to power on the screen again, then reenter the password, and then it actually unlocks.
[22:38:54] <Evolver> It has me worried, wondering if there is a false UI.
[22:39:21] <Evolver> There have for example been reports of simulating fake ios reboots, so what I'm saying is not that weird.
[22:42:41] *** luca0N_ is now known as luca0N
[22:46:22] <tomreyn> and that's why we should never do anything sensitive with a system which we can't tell is comrpomised or not.
[22:47:43] <Apachez> Evolver: take backup of important stuff from that and factory reset it ?
[22:49:07] <skill> wonder if it's a screen timeout issue
[22:49:43] <Evolver> skill: if it were a timeout issue, it would happen at random times of the day too
[22:50:01] <Evolver> but it happens only at the first unlock of each morning, like clockwork, not that I wake up at a fixed time.
[22:50:01] <Apachez> perhaps its a deep sleep issue?
[22:50:03] <Apachez> but again
[22:50:05] <Apachez> take backup
[22:50:07] <Apachez> wipe the device
[22:50:12] <Apachez> update to latest firmware
[22:50:25] <Evolver> but it will inevitably happen again even if I reset
[22:50:27] <Apachez> and then (before adding any apps) - still haves the same way?
[22:50:31] <Evolver> ok good point
[22:50:37] <Apachez> behaves
[22:51:14] <Evolver> Note that it took me a month just to realize this was happening. Human memory is presumably the weakest when waking up.

[23:48:47] <Evolver> operational: i don't understand how an app can control the lock screen
