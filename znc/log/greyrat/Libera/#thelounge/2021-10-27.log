[01:08:31] <johncs> MaxLeiter: üëç cool, I'll close the PR then. I can always revive it if I get a better sense of better-sqlite's benefits after mucking with our models anyways.
[01:09:16] <bookworm> there are some cleanups we can extract though I think

[01:12:16] <johncs> Yeah I'll probably do some refactoring here and there as part of my reactions changes.
[01:12:22] <johncs> The  test I added I'd like to port over for example.
[01:16:59] <johncs> You're welcome to canabilize anything as well. Like moving the reversal into the search function was clean and simple.

[01:51:41] <bookworm> yes, I meant that
[01:52:38] <bookworm> btw, I'd like to unblob the DB, that should be much more space efficient... any reason for not doing that?
[01:52:44] <bookworm> It would make everything simpler
[01:54:40] <johncs> I don't know what unblob means in this context. Do you mean remove the use of JSON to store the messages?
[01:55:21] <bookworm> yes, in actual columns you know, maybe kinda like how a relational DB should be setup ;P
[01:55:40] <bookworm> we are storing so much redundant text it ain't even funny
[01:55:54] <bookworm> can't query it efficiently either
[01:57:03] <johncs> You can query json in sqlite fairly efficiently, as well as index it. I'm a bit more familiar with sqlite's capabilities now.
[01:57:25] <johncs> Columns seem fine. I haven't really dug into why JSON is being used here ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
[01:57:37] <bookworm> more efficient than text? If you have to repatse json over and over again? Very doubtful
[01:57:53] <bookworm> because it's easy to do I'd guess
[01:58:11] <bookworm> reparse*
[01:58:29] <johncs> parsing obviously costs non-zero time yes
[01:58:34] <bookworm> sqlite isn't as sophisticated as say the postgres json type
[01:59:08] <bookworm> it can do some things, sure. But it certainly doesn't make it faster nor easier to write sql queries
[02:03:55] <bookworm> gonna make a quick test to see how the storage consumption behaves, then we can make a decision if this might be worth it

[03:42:35] <bookworm> (I simply fired it up on localhost but obviously everything still works)
[03:43:18] <johncs> I think all the devtools have an actual web socket "preview" now (which is _such_ a nice addition)
[03:43:27] <johncs> You can see the messages going back and forth
[03:43:30] <johncs> the view is much different
[03:43:47] <johncs> you could also look to see if your browser got a successful 101
[03:44:06] <johncs> you could also check if the request was for ws:// or http://

[03:58:31] <bookworm> ha, welcome to the joyful world of localhost... there it still *is* using websockets
[03:58:56] <bookworm> what's the reason to deploy TL as http on non localhost?
[04:10:05] <johncs> you want to drop support for ws without dropping http?
[04:10:15] <johncs> i don't understand what you're tryna do
[04:10:15] <bookworm> what's the problem?
[04:10:36] <johncs> what is the reason to do this?
[04:10:46] <johncs> polling works, obviously
[04:10:56] <bookworm> what I want is to have a security policy that doesn't allow arbitrary websocket (non encrypted) traffic on https deployments
[04:11:30] <johncs> ws is only allowed on self, and further than that browsers don't allow ws on https connections
[04:11:45] <bookworm> including plain ws: on a http endpoint that isn't localhost is very much insecure, or am I missing something?
[04:12:00] <bookworm> is it?
[04:12:39] <bookworm> the csp of ws: allows ws: connections to any host
[04:13:00] <johncs> than restrict it to self. but i did think it already was
[04:13:19] <bookworm> 'self' == protocol + host  + port
[04:13:41] <bookworm> and as you are serving TL over http in those cases that means only http works, not ws:
[04:16:02] <johncs> ah I see. Did some reading, that is very nuanced
[04:16:11] <bookworm> don't get me started
[04:16:18] <johncs> I still don't see the concrete threat though
[04:16:21] <bookworm> been reading the same docs for an hour and a half
[04:16:37] <bookworm> well, then why add a CSP at all if you don't see a thread ;)
[04:16:47] <bookworm> the whole point of that thing is to restrict access as much as possible
[04:16:49] <johncs> I guess you're imagining an HTTP deployment being convinced to access an insecure web socket on another host
[04:17:14] <johncs> that seems like a minor threat to remove web socket support for
[04:17:21] <bookworm> that or https --> ws --> external host, although hopefully that's blocked by browsers?
[04:17:26] <johncs> it is
[04:17:28] <johncs> afaik
[04:17:43] <johncs> So still the only thing I can think of is what I said
[04:18:27] <johncs> Also the proposed policy allows wss from other hosts if my very newly updated understanding holds
[04:18:42] <johncs> So you've only done something about the threat for HTTP deployments
[04:18:56] <bookworm> I see two options, A) s/ws:/ws:$hostname/ that would prevent most issues on http installs. B) split "safe" CSP policies from the garbage we only want on the index for sockets.io to work
[04:19:09] <bookworm> yes
[04:19:32] <bookworm> but at least over the encrypted channel so you can't possible accidentally leak things to an observer
[04:19:49] <johncs> http polling is unencrypted too
[04:19:57] <johncs> The proposed policy doesn't increase privacy
[04:20:08] <bookworm> which is my point as to why an http endpoint over the internet is not a good idea :)
[04:21:16] <johncs> which I told you you should make a separate pr about if you wanna push for. within the context of this pr, I don't see your change as doing much
[04:21:53] <bookworm> fair, I explicitly made it its own commit to make it obvious
[04:22:08] <bookworm> it's not like I'm trying to fly this under the radar or something
[04:22:23] <bookworm> I missunderstood the mozilla docs
[04:23:24] <johncs> i wasn't trying to insinuate that. just that if we wanna drop http we should make sure it's well communicated and update all the relevant parts of the code.
[04:23:44] <bookworm> I'm not gonna drop http
[04:23:48] <bookworm> I use that on localhost
[04:24:03] <bookworm> what doesn't make sense is to expose that on non localhost
[04:24:17] <bookworm> it's absolutely horrid
[04:24:37] <bookworm> anything in the hops between now reads your passwords, from TL and IRC if you are very unlucky

[05:06:25] <johncs> if you do want to tighten the csp for web sockets i bet we could read the host header and use the host in there. Sanitizing it properly and considering reverse proxies might be tricky, but sounds doable and I bet someone's written something about it.
[05:07:27] <johncs> from what i read earlier it sounds like self might be sufficient for wss too, depending on browser support for that vs TL's support
[05:07:53] <bookworm> what do you mean?
[05:08:00] <johncs> i said a few things, which part?
[05:08:16] <bookworm> the self is sufficient for wss part
[05:08:23] <johncs> ah, lemme find it again
[05:10:20] <johncs> https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-csp/issues/7
[05:10:52] <johncs> Just the first part of that thread. The first PR mentioned added a "self means wss too" exception

[05:16:35] <bookworm> ah, ok. Doesn't fix the issue of ws: still being present though. What I don't like is depending on the browser behavior of preventing the downgrade... after all they could suddenly have the idea that they only prevent it *unless* the CSP explicitly allows it, which ours does
[05:17:22] <johncs> host header?
[05:17:49] <bookworm> reverse proxy is a valid point
[05:18:00] <johncs> ?
[05:18:19] <bookworm> >Sanitizing it properly and considering reverse proxies might be tricky
[05:19:00] <johncs> the reverse proxy sounds straightforward. I'm not even sure they usually mangle the host header, but we could just say that you need to use a proper forwarded header or w/e that is.
[05:21:20] <johncs> i just mean "requires careful consideration" by tricky really
[05:23:49] <bookworm> looking at the websocket traffic is actually neat for debugging / figuring out what is going on, thanks for taht
[05:24:05] <johncs> haha isn't it

[18:48:13] <mnx> hi everyone, I'm having trouble with oidentd with docker image of thelounge
[18:48:25] <mnx> I can't start oidentd when docker image is running and vice versa
[18:48:54] <mnx> docker throws that port 113 is used
[18:49:07] <mnx> and oidentd throws an error when docker is runing 
[18:49:20] <mnx> effectively disabling oidentd 
[18:49:23] <mnx> any hints? 
[18:55:28] <mnx> also adding anythign related to thelounge to oidentd.conf kills oidentd.service 
[18:58:31] *** queria is now known as queria^afk
[19:06:30] <bookworm> mnx: modify the listening port of your container on the host (not within the container) aka the port mapping host --> docker
[19:08:16] <bookworm> also, what exactly do you have containerized (oidentd / TL / both)? Any hypervisor like swarm / kubernetes or what have you? Or rather plain docker?
[19:08:45] <mnx> plain docker
[19:08:55] <mnx> ports are set correctly 
[19:09:56] <bookworm> I highly doubt that as then you wouldn't have any collision
[19:10:38] <mnx> yes, they are 
[19:11:13] <bookworm> mkey, then you don't have an issue, so all is well right? ;)
[19:12:03] <mnx> ok, ports are fine, adding anything to oidentd.conf kills oidentd
[19:12:07] <mnx> any hints on that
[19:12:09] <mnx> ?
[19:12:11] <mnx> ;-)
[19:12:39] <bookworm> what do you have containerized and what is running on the host?

[19:14:22] <mnx> damn
[19:14:31] <mnx> it's standard docker image of thelounge 4.3.0
[19:15:09] <bookworm> and oidentd?
[19:15:24] <mnx> it was from apt 
[19:15:29] <mnx> but currenlty I'm installing 3.0 
[19:15:40] <mnx> to see if anything changes
[19:15:47] <bookworm> why are you mixing docker and non docker?
[19:15:53] <bookworm> anyhow
[19:16:04] <mnx> what the hell 
[19:16:19] <mnx> in the docs is said to install oidentd localy ;-)
[19:16:23] <mnx> and bind it to docker 
[19:16:41] <bookworm> which docs? Ours?
[19:16:46] <mnx> https://thelounge.chat/docs/guides/identd-and-oidentd#using-oidentd-to-forward-requests-to-the-built-in-server
[19:16:54] *** Joins: jimmyb (~jimmyb@user/jimmyb)
[19:16:56] <bookworm> generally as soon as you cram anything into docker, you'd cram everything there
[19:17:23] <mnx> As such we recommend setting up the built-in server along side oidentd and configuring it to forward requests to the built-in server.
[19:17:50] <mnx> so you're saying I don't need oidentd? 
[19:17:51] <bookworm> yes? But that's a different problem
[19:18:05] <mnx> just running docker will be sufficient?
[19:18:23] <bookworm> do you understand what docker is and does?
[19:18:58] <bookworm> your question implies no... docker is simply a thing that makes lightweight "virtual machines" that isolates processes
[19:19:14] <bookworm> it has nothing to do with oidentd nor TL, it's simply a means of administering a server
[19:19:27] <mnx> ok, thanks for help
