[00:08:35] <feepbot> <gwern> 'As of Thursday, there were 523 aircraft leased to Russian carriers by companies outside the country, according to IBA, a consulting firm. Of those, 101 are on lease to S7 Airlines and 89 to Aeroflot. Both airlines have stopped flying internationally, eliminating any chance of repossessing the planes on foreign soil. “The general consensus is: That’s it, we will not be
[00:08:35] <feepbot> able to recover them,” said Vitaly Guzhva, a finance professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Dr. Guzhva and others who attended a recent industry conference in San Diego said the predicament for the leasing companies was the talk of the event, held by the International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading. Experts there generally aligned around the view that the
[00:08:35] <feepbot> companies were facing the possibility of huge losses, they said. All told, the planes are worth as much as $12 billion, according to Ishka, an aviation consulting firm.'  https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/12/business/russia-airlines-planes.html I wonder after how long of an embargo the planes will break down and become useless from lack of maintenance/parts and genuinely become a

[00:13:35] <feepbot> <gwern> 'While a few planes may have been recovered abroad before international flights were halted, they are of little use to their owners without the meticulous maintenance records that accompany every aircraft and are often stored by airlines themselves, experts said. And the longer a plane is stuck in Russia, the greater the concern that work on the jet’s body, engines and
[00:13:36] <feepbot> flight systems may not be logged, causing its value to plummet. “Unless you have those records, the aircraft is virtually worthless,” said Quentin Brasie, the founder and chief executive of ACI Aviation Consulting. “They’re literally more important than the asset itself.”'
[00:18:36] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Ken Hill, who also performs aircraft repossessions, knows that first hand. Two years ago, a U.S. leasing company hired Mr. Hill to recover three Boeing 737s at a small airport just outside Moscow, he said. The owner of the company that had leased the planes resisted his efforts to recover them, he said, but, after a few days Mr. Hill gained access to the hangar — only to
[00:18:36] <feepbot> find that the aircraft had been gutted. “The airplanes were there, but guess what wasn’t there? The engines,” he said. “They had robbed all three airplanes. They were basically just junk carcasses.”'

[01:28:53] <gwern> what adventures that trailer has gone on on its decade off
[01:34:15] <gwern> it has gone on an epic picaresque through shopping malls, suburbia, drug gangs, shootouts, a year on a ranch where it fell in love with the owner's daughter, a brief career as a radio DJ and rapper...
[01:34:40] <CoJaBo> All of those are entirely possible
[01:34:51] <gwern> it has seen the american dream from the below, above, rotten innards, and come out older and wiser, and a full grown trailer, rusty with years and memories
[01:36:29] <CoJaBo> It was wrecked and then accidentally left by the side of the road for 6 weeks somewhere outside of Philly
[01:36:44] <CoJaBo> We've always assumed that someone stole it and sold it for scrap to buy meth

[02:59:31] <two2thehead> my fav is my namesake. shot twice in the head, and the official explanation being 'suicide'
[03:00:03] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: for some reason, hyphens just aren't working in chrome and thus in popins, leading to the current 'justify' setting causing all of the stretching which I thought we had fixed/gotten right of
[03:00:34] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: and it looks so bad on my phone for a lot of abstracts, with, ironically, the ones using the most small words looking the worst
[03:01:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is this just in popins or also popups
[03:02:32] <gwern> I haven't checked popups because they are much larger, but I couldn't seem to trigger hyphenation on regular body text anywhere in /Lorem no matter what I did, so I assume popups are suffering from it too
[03:02:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh I see, wow
[03:03:28] <gwern> yeah, it's so weird. I don't remember this being an issue before working on my workstation and everything. I'm left wondering if I'm totally screwing something up or what

[03:04:08] <gwern> the CSS works in FF, the inspector confirms the hyphenate etc properties *are* enabled and there on the things I think they are on, hyphenation is very needed for layout, so... ???
[03:04:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Did you put some Hebrew text in /Lorem again
[03:04:23] <gwern> hm. the link icons?
[03:04:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... which ones??
[03:04:49] <gwern> we have alef for Unsong, I think
[03:04:55] <gwern> also, yud for yudkowsky,net
[03:04:59] <gwern> that might be arabic
[03:05:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> No we switched the alef to math alef specifically for this
[03:05:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Remember
[03:05:44] <gwern> hm... 'name: ALEF SYMBOL old-name: FIRST TRANSFINITE CARDINAL general-category: Lo (Letter, Other)' yeah that sounds math and not hebrew...
[03:05:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Where's the yudkowsky sample link
[03:05:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Can't find it
[03:05:57] <gwern> I guess it's got to be ' י HEBREW LETTER YUD 0x05D9' then
[03:06:12] <gwern> yudkowsky.net was one of the last ones so it's to the bottom right of the link icon list
[03:06:52] <gwern> but that should be unrelated to the hyphenation, I think, because I noticed and screenshot it far away from /Lorem, on /notes/Scaling, which has no hebrew I can recall
[03:06:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nope there's something else
[03:07:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah hang on though I can't even troubleshoot the hyphenation properly with this, lol
[03:07:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gotta at least temp-fix

[03:10:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> (because of course)
[03:12:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm, I see hyphenation happening at full width...
[03:13:43] <gwern> at least for me, I could only spot hyphenation happening for words with hyphens in them getting linebroken. can you replicate hyphenation not happening in popins in chrome/chromium?
[03:14:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Y...yes... but it's ... hang on
[03:15:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why *isn't* hyphenation happening at narrow widths on FF or Chrome, that's my first question
[03:16:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: We *did* get this working right, didn't we?? Did I imagine that??
[03:16:42] <gwern> i don't know ;_;
[03:17:09] <gwern> web design, with all its caching issues and glitche and other things, has gaslit me
[03:17:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok ok there's a note in the CSS. Let's read it and hope for enlightenment:
[03:18:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> n wide screens (desktop), use fully-justified text (words get broken/hyphenated as necessary to avoid a 'ragged margin'), overriding browser default of 'flush left, ragged' right (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_alignment#Flush_left ) 
[03:18:27] <Obormot\Arcturus>  On mobile/narrow screens, that doesn't work as well: because browsers do greedy layout, justification forces 's t r e t c h e d out' words and large spaces, leading to blatant https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_(typography) , getting worse the narrower the screen (eg. in lists). On wide screens, it isn't too bad, and justification is still better than not, but on mobile it is extremely noticeable. Switching to flush left
[03:18:27] <Obormot\Arcturus>  ragged right doesn't look as nicely 'even', but it avoids that pathological behavior. (More advanced typesetting algorithms like Knuth-Plass https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_wrap_and_word_wrap#Minimum_raggedness can handle mobile widths nicely, but no contemporary browser implements them natively, and all JS implementations I've looked at are buggy.)
[03:18:28] <Robomot> Typographic alignment - Wikipedia [Flush left] (In English and most European languages where words are read left-to-right, text is usually aligned "flush left",[1] meaning that the text of a paragraph is aligned on the left-hand side with the right-hand side ragged. This is the default style of text alignment on the World Wide Web for left-to-right text. [2] Quotations are often indented.)
[03:18:28] <Robomot> River (typography) - Wikipedia (In typography, rivers (or rivers of white) are gaps in typesetting which appear to run through a paragraph of text due to a coincidental alignment of spaces.[1][2][3][4][5][6] Rivers can occur regardless of the spacing settings, but are most noticeable with wide inter-word spaces caused by full text justification or monospaced fonts. Rivers are less noticeable with proportional …)
[03:18:28] <Robomot> Line wrap and word wrap - Wikipedia [Minimum raggedness] (A different algorithm, used in TeX, minimizes the sum of the squares of the lengths of the spaces at the end of lines to produce a more aesthetically pleasing result. The following example compares this method with the greedy algorithm, which does not always minimize squared space.)
[03:19:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> That was less enlightening than I hoped for.
[03:19:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> But! At least the actual CSS explains things: the `hyphens:auto` is in a min-width:900px media query
[03:20:26] <gwern> alas, that is not the answer. I did notice that and removing the min-width and applying directly did not help matters. even a '* {' didn't make it hyphenate
[03:20:32] <gwern> it did in FF. it didn't in chromium.
[03:20:45] * Obormot\Arcturus checks
[03:20:52] <gwern> I could inspect the popin paragraphs. they had their hyphens:auto set exactly as intended. it just... didn't do anything?

[03:22:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nope, works in FF and Chromium both, for the body text
[03:22:43] <gwern> (aieee)
[03:23:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now the question is, why are popins justified - that is still wrong
[03:23:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... and the answer is that they're specifically set to be justified
[03:23:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok
[03:23:46] <gwern> you set it specifically to that in your patch
[03:23:53] <gwern> why I do not know
[03:24:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Me neither! I'm sure I had good reasons
[03:24:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> But now I will set it back.

[03:32:08] <gwern> ...directories are hidden. I'm thinking perhaps directory pages can have an anchor ID "tag-target" which the directory generation code sets to be either around the list of directories (if >1) or around # Links (if just 'parent ^'), and then tags are linked as '/docs/tag#tag-target'

[03:32:58] <two2thehead> point :-/
[03:33:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm. It's because of `width:-moz-fit-content`, which apparently has additional, sinister consequences, unlike it's unprefixed sibling
[03:34:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess it makes it as wide as possible in the parent block first, and then goes "oop, guess that can't fit next to the float anymore, and we certainly can't size it back down, OH WELL"
[03:34:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> While Chromium's layout algorithm handles this case more intelligently

[05:47:08] <PapuaHardyNet> quanticle literally mentioned that as the first thing that happened to him
[05:47:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Anyhow, let me know when it's up, I'll whip up some CSS, and you can decide whether to add it, or we can experiment with layouts etc.
[05:47:53] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: well, in the 2 column version, you wouldn't be distracted reading the plain version because it has no links or footnotes...
[05:48:14] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: ha, yes, but he was still reading gwern.net stuff! so still a success in my books
[05:49:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: HMMM what if, on wide viewports, the two columns expanded to be side-by-side normal-width apiece
[05:49:42] <gwern> but hm, if they are distracting maybe the 2-column version is no good because you can see the density of linking out of the corner of your eye and it loses the one-tw punch effect... naybe the linked version really does need to come *after*
[05:49:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> But we'd need a bit of JS for that, I think ... that, or it'd have to be nested sections
[05:49:54] <PapuaHardyNet> it is a painful trade-off, and I get why you are going with a two columns approach instead of something less complicated.
[05:50:15] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: well, my original idea was to just copy-paste the story
[05:50:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: OR, what if links only appeared on hover, along with a toggle that also appeared on hover and let you toggle in the "+links" version fulltime
[05:51:23] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: hm. how about no toggle - I hover over a word I guess might be a link, and suddenly a sea of underlining happens
[05:51:35] <gwern> you know what an ask of readers any toggle is
[05:52:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: That can also work yes
[05:52:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But, again, needs some custom JS)
[05:52:45] <gwern> actually, that might work perfectly. as a reader I am toodling along enjoying the story, mouse inactive, then I hover over an interesting word and blam, the hidden iceberg emerges. but everyone has weak visual memories, so when they unhover, they gradually forget
[05:52:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> (You know what we need, we need a page-specific-JS system)
[05:53:46] <gwern> how about something like... 'hidden by default until end of page turns it on permanently'
[05:53:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yep that too is possib;e
[05:54:22] <gwern> so I get the hover, until I finish the story (by scrolling to the end of the page) and then automatically all the links come on permanently (and I refresh the page if I want the naive virgin experience)
[05:55:23] <gwern> yes, I think I like that better than the 2-column idea or just pasting in a linked copy after the plain copy
[05:55:32] <PapuaHardyNet> I like that idea too
[05:55:39] <PapuaHardyNet> although what happens to non-JS users
[05:55:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Non-JS users are left shivering in the cold and dark
[05:56:08] <gwern> as usual, they don't get the progressive enhancement. they'll just see a normal gwern.net page. clean readable HTML but lacking the cool features
[05:56:14] <PapuaHardyNet> hell yeah
[05:56:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Let their conviction warm them; let their sense of purity light their way
[05:56:39] <PapuaHardyNet> I assume you aren't going to use a cookie to ensure that someone who has once finished the story later on also gets permanent links
[05:56:52] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: nah. they can just scroll to the end

[05:57:41] <gwern> let me keep my illusions ;_;
[05:58:44] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah, I like this JS idea. do you think there's anywhere else it would be useful?
[05:59:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uhh I really couldn't tell you off the top of my head
[05:59:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Let's at least proof-of-concept it and then we can think more concretely about that
[06:00:12] <gwern> mm. well ok so for now I'll set a body class on /Clippy.page (same way I set 'drop-caps-kanzlei'). how about 'hideLinksUntilRead'
[06:00:21] <gwern> or maybe 'readerMode'?
[06:00:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Whatever it is, make it snake case instead of camel
[06:00:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> or uh whatever it's called when you hyphens
[06:01:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> How about hidden-links
[06:01:38] <gwern> this could be useful for my annotated books like _Notenki Memoirs_ or _Radiance_, where they are heavily hyperlinked... we could make 'reader mode' hide sidenotes/footnotes, links+link-icons, section numbers...
[06:01:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah
[06:01:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok them
[06:01:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> reader-mode then
[06:02:54] <gwern> https://www.gwern.net/docs/eva/2002-takeda-notenkimemoirs oh, we could also have 'hideable' class around elements. like the page numbers in _Notenki Memoirs_, all those '[pg 23–26]' - very useful for referencing etc but if you're just reading through it, do you care?
[06:02:56] <Robomot> The Notenki Memoirs: Studio Gainax And The Men Who Created Evangelion · Gwern.net (Fulltext annotated e-book of 2002 memoir by anime producer Yasuhiro Takeda, discussing Japanese SF conventions & fandom, formation & history of Gainax and its productions up to 2002, including the origins of Evangelion & the tax raid.)
[06:03:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> How do you envision them un-hiding, though? Not on hover, presumably? It'd cause reflow
[06:03:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Would they merely be invis? But then there'd be gaps
[06:04:31] <gwern> I think invisible, yeah. you know they're there and can hover to expose them (and everything else which is hidden by reader mode)
[06:04:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmmm
[06:05:03] <gwern> maybe some sort of extremely tiny icon to indicate 'hidden'

[06:05:53] <gwern> yes, this seems like a useful and general idea... I'm not a fan of special-casing Clippy with a weird hiding thing, but this fits very naturally into the overall gwern.net paradigm of 'structural reading'
[06:07:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> I confess I'm somewhat less convinced of this than you are, but it's worth experimenting with
[06:07:14] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: because after the huge amount of time I sank into transcribing and annotating and researching and excerpting tv shows etc I couldn't bear repeating the toc links manually >.<
[06:07:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heh
[06:09:23] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: this is also useful for readers who feel overloaded by the UI. we can put reader mode in the theme toggle and make it a three-way switch: force reader mode off, force reader mode on, auto (page-specific overrides: sets it on until scroll to end of page, then off)
[06:09:47] <gwern> 'reader
[06:09:53] <gwern> mode' is super popular in general in browsers
[06:10:21] <gwern> we can put the reader mode icons in the theme toggle
[06:10:45] <gwern> (borrowing them from FF & Chrome who have educated readers about them)
[06:14:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> gosh
[06:16:39] * gwern thinks carefully and dumps the section links with elinks into an emacs buffer and links them semi-automatically with a macro

[06:25:23] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I've started a sync. the body class will be 'reader-mode'
[06:27:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> k.
[06:32:18] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: so reader mode would strip down the default view radically to just the main body. hide the sidebar except for the logo; hide the metadata block so only the title is there, remove the numbers from the ToC (or the ToC entirely?), hide the arabesque footer & anon feedback links...

[06:39:14] <saturn2> gwern: a lot of modern keyboards don't even come with an end key anymore

[06:40:12] <saturn2> of course
[06:41:00] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: now for mobile which lacks 'hover', I'm thinking 'long press' is the equivalent. a press works as normal on whatever they are tapping. but if the reader presses and holds for 0.x seconds, everything becomes visible

[07:58:41] <gwern> oh wow, I'm finishing this nicotine article, and the middle is incredible chutzpah. it's all about this girl hospitalized in the ICU for 'THC' and then several paragraphs about her nicotine addiction
[07:59:01] <gwern> no mention of the whole, you know, 'vitamin E acetate in the blackmarket THC she was smoking, and not in the nicotine' part
[07:59:07] <gwern> *so* dishonest
[08:02:51] <quanticle> Yeah, welcome to the new moral panic, I guess.
[08:03:22] <quanticle> Yesterday it was Dungeons and Dragons fueling satanist cults, today it's teenage vaping.
[08:03:24] <gwern> and it just keeps going. like the peak was in 2019 and we know damn right well every single case of ICUs was the blackmarket thc
[08:03:55] <quanticle> Yeah, just like violent video games causing school shootings.
[08:04:04] <gwern> and yet, here we are with the NYT printing x-rays of (thc) lungs and doing everything it can to say 'nicotine did this' without actually saying an explicitly false thing
[08:04:37] <PapuaHardyNet> how is NYT benefitting from this?
[08:04:52] <gwern> they are just part of the moral panic and overlearned tobacco-hate
[08:05:05] <gwern> it is natural because vaping is *big corporations*
[08:05:12] <quanticle> The NYT is an adaptation executor, not a fitness maximizer
[08:05:33] <gwern> (the fact that the vitamin E acetate deaths came from smalltime blackmarketers and marijuana sellers is an irrelevant detail)
[08:06:20] <gwern> there's also a lot of shirky-esque motivated reasoning here: what do all the anti-smoking crusaders do after they won? well, find another enemy
[08:07:08] <gwern> you can gin up plenty of correlational evidence, everyone knows what the right (morally) true answer is and the confounding assures you plenty of grist for the mill

[08:12:26] <gwern> this is not an accident. she - and yeah, checking now, it's a she - has to know the truth, to word it that carefully. she mentions the THC use, so she technically isn't *telling* you that nicotine caused the hospitalization. she merely says 'THC and nicotine' led to the hospitalization and immediately spends all the time talking about nicotine

[08:13:37] <gwern> if she were just ignorant, she would at some point explicitly say 'nicotine damaged her lungs' or something. but it's always, 'vaping', or, 'THC and nicotine', so it's technically true. adulterated blackmarket poison is indeed a subset of 'vaping'. it is indeed logically part of a boolean 'and'

[08:14:40] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, I can see that. crazy how she mentions THC *just once* and then redirects the discussion to nicotine
[08:14:54] <gwern> right??? it's an incredibly careful boxticking
[08:15:16] <gwern> the THC mention there is there *only* so she can say 'ah but I didn't technically say it was nicotine. I explicitly mentioned THC!'

[08:18:52] <gwern> often this sort of write-around is very clunky because they repeat the overly-general booleans, violating the Gricean maxims, or make other mistakes. this one is just smooth and slides right by
[08:20:17] <saturn2> it's still the same old tobacco companies making vape stuff so not even really a new enemy
[08:20:51] <gwern> yeah. there are a lot of smalltimers (vapers weren't even invented in the USA, but some chinese guy iirc) but the big ones pivoted and bought them out
[08:21:48] <gwern> (incidentally, no one in the NYT comment section points this out)
[08:23:04] <saturn2> this seemed to be why kuudes supported banning vaping - not because it would make anyone better off, but because it would punish big tobacco for what it did in the 20th century

[08:58:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> And how was he killed? Well you see, said daughter was a cleric, and she SUMMONED THE GOD POSEIDON, who came (in the form of a titanic entity of animate water) and smashed her father the sorcerer, and all his works, and the elder god he had partly summoned, and his house, etc.
[08:59:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then she herself was killed by her rebellious army of shadows (which were the bound spirits of people she had killed)

[16:16:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[16:22:41] <zebrask> Same here. Restaurants are a no go on any kind of diet for me.
[16:26:47] <PapuaHardyNet> "So whether consciously or not, philosophers such as Bostrom began to divorce themselves from an explicit ‘transhumanist’ agenda. This wasn’t a change in beliefs or policy proposals so much as a change in emphasis. Humanity was still meant to conquer the stars and produce trillions upon trillions of kaleidoscopic descendants, but this project began to be framed in ‘neutral’, ‘objective’ terms such as utilitarianism and population 
[16:26:47] <PapuaHardyNet> ethics." so what came first is not the utilitarian bullshit about "hundreds of billions of future lives", but the transhumanist agenda, and the effective altruism philosophical BS is just post hoc
[16:28:29] <PapuaHardyNet> the word to describe it is "longtermism" btw
[16:33:43] <PapuaHardyNet> oh btw obormot, you expressed your disbelief about why EA thinks donating to Africa > donating elsewhere and took it as an axiom, this may be a sensible historical reason: "The original idea behind Effective Altruism is pretty simple: A dollar goes further in the 3rd world than the 1st world, so if your goal is to make peoples lives better you’ll get more leverage by helping people in developing countries."
[16:37:16] <PapuaHardyNet> hey Obormot\Arcturus, what word do you use to describe the technique used by certain smaller groups to infiltrate EA to use them to support their cause? because namespace describes x-risk theorists as a community who basically did that
[16:38:46] <PapuaHardyNet> ah, entryism
[16:46:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Yes, yes, I have heard this about "a dollar goes further", Holden Karnofsky quotes it in his post, I believe, and it's been mentioned... but we can construct all manner of justifications, and yet the fact remains that the original primary cause area (broadly speaking) was essentially picked out of a hat, just because they needed to pick *something* (supposedly), and yet it later turned out to be exactly the best
[16:46:47] <Obormot\Arcturus>  cause area (supposedly)
[16:48:08] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, I don't consider it the best cause area, that is very unlikely and very much smacks of rationalization.
[16:48:46] <Obormot\Gaia> PapuaHardyNet: Generally speaking - and this, actually, applies both to the H+ thing you just mentioned and the thing I just said - you should expect pretty much all philosophical reasoning in and around EA to be post hoc rationalization and BS
[16:49:29] <Obormot\Gaia> Starting with Peter Singer and going all the way through Robert Wiblin and Will MacAskill and David Pearce etc.
[16:50:13] <Obormot\Gaia> They start with religious fanaticism and they backfill whatever philosophical absurdity they need

[16:59:05] <Obormot\Gaia> (One of the paradigmatic examples being Singer's argument about the moral value of animals: after all, says Singer, a pig's cognitive capabilities clearly exceed those of a human newborn, yet we think that newborn babies have lots of moral value, as much as any human, so obviously pigs should also have the same moral value! Now, setting aside the myriad potential objections in the vein of "unlike Oxford philosophy professors,
[16:59:05] <Obormot\Gaia>  most people do not think that moral value comes entirely from cognitive capabilities", the most obvious objection, the almost-impossible-to-miss objection, is to flip the logic: we don't think that pigs have moral value, human newborns are dumber than pigs, therefore perhaps newborns don't have moral value...? But Singer never gives any indication that this has ever even occurred to him!)
[17:04:21] <Obormot\Gaia> (And of course there's Singer's famous child-in-the-pond argument, for which it is almost trivially easy to find serious, essentially fatal, objections - which are, naturally, never addressed in either Singer's own work or the innumerable popularizations - but which is held up by legions of EAs and similar types as "this is the argument that convinced me of <my current EA-or-whatever views>"... one is always tempted to ask
[17:04:21] <Obormot\Gaia>  "yes, and *after* you found this argument that gave you a supposedly logical reason to do what you had wanted to do already, did you think for even five minutes about whether there might be any reason to reject it?" - but it's pointless to put such questions to fanatics...)
[17:07:16] <PapuaHardyNet> sheesh, the child-in-the-pond argument is so famous that I thought it preceeded EA. Anyway, 
[17:08:36] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, it is! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine,_Affluence,_and_Morality is the source of the child-in-the-pond thing a
[17:08:36] <Robomot> Famine, Affluence, and Morality - Wikipedia ("Famine, Affluence, and Morality" is an essay written by Peter Singer in 1971 and published in Philosophy and Public Affairs in 1972.

The essay was inspired by the starvation of Bangladesh Liberation War refugees, …)
[17:08:44] <Obormot\Gaia> Well, it did precede EA, though this is not really an informative fact - it's part of Peter Singer's philosophy which justifies EA, Singer is one the philosophical originators of EA as a concept, so it's perhaps less "preceded" and more "constructed" (or at least "played a part in the construction of")

[18:45:58] <ojarvini> Indeed, seems rather convincing (but as I know so little about this, this is not very much information). Now I'm wondering of things like "if it's so simple, why haven't we solved it / why don't people know more about this / why don't government nutrition recommendations focus more on this". Any takes on that?
[18:47:53] <ojarvini> (I am aware of the term "civilizational inadequacy", but the obesity epidemic does seem quite important, and I would guess there are a lot of people thinking about it)
[18:48:59] <capisce> yes, I'm also wondering that
[18:50:32] <zebrask> I don't think anything of that nature is really ever so simple.
[18:51:26] <zebrask> And it's not clear how much people pay attention to nutritional recommendations, so the interventions that are likely to matter are likely much more draconian.
[18:52:02] <capisce> people have cut their consumption of red meat, because of nutritional recommendations
[18:53:09] <zebrask> The same people who are increasingly obese?
[18:53:22] <capisce> "The first Dietary Guidelines for Americans in 1980 called for less saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. Americans are surprisingly good at listening to dietary guidelines and as a result, our per capita consumption of animal-based foods, red meat, and salt (foods high in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium) have not increased in recent decades, so it's unlikely that they are the culprits driving 
[18:53:28] <capisce> increasingly poor health in the last fifty years"
[18:53:32] <capisce> the majority of people are increasingly obese
[18:54:08] <ojarvini> (Even if people did not pay that much attention to nutritional recommendations, I'd still hope that government nutrition recommendations would reflect the best information available)

[18:54:22] <Robomot> image/svg+xml (202 KB)
[18:54:34] <capisce> this shows red meat consumption has gone significantly down
[18:55:08] <capisce> poultry consumtion has gone up (and poultry happens to contain a significant amount of linoleic acid due to the way the chickens are fed)
[18:55:12] <zebrask> Yes, but 40% of the population could cut their red meat in half and 60% stay the same and it would make per capita meat consumption drop by 25% (assuming heterogeneous consumption before)
[18:57:06] <capisce> but then if that was the cause of chronic disease and obesity, you'd still expect rates to drop, and not keep climbing

[19:07:40] <Ralith> is this one of those things where it's going go turn out the answer is "because we've stopped attributing everything to 'natural causes' and people are dying less of other more immediate issues"
[19:08:26] <zebrask> Like if you look at life expectancy and maternal mortality in the US the numbers look pretty bad, but if you look at those numbers among like.. US white collar professionals, it's not nearly as bad.

[19:12:19] <capisce> only in 2015 did it peak in the US
[19:12:24] <zebrask> I also have a meta-rule that diet related stuff is one of those areas where the evidence tends to be weak and measured with too-blunt instruments and the plausible factors are so numerous that it's easy to construct any number of shockingly compelling narratives about it, so my bar for evidence in this area is very high.

[23:16:59] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: but also, if the body class doesn't set it, how does it get set? the body class is literally the only place $cssExtension$ gets used, and that is literally the only place in gwern.net that *knows* what a page is supposed to do
[23:17:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: And now inspect the paragraph itself...
[23:17:24] <gwern> there is no list anywhere that 'knows' /Screwfly should get a cheshire

[23:20:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: But it is the JS! Specifically, rewrite.js, ll. 831-866
[23:20:29] <gwern> maybe it's redundant. both the body class and JS work
[23:20:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> No
[23:20:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's the opposite
[23:21:13] <gwern> oh wait, I got the noscrupt wrong. 'default' doesn't mean noscript. yeah, dropcaps break without the js
[23:21:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> The block class works, AND the JS also applies the block class to requisite blocks on the basis of the body class, if present
[23:21:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> But now the question is "why isn't this working on /Clippy".
[23:22:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> No console errors...
[23:22:36] <gwern> I would assume because there's no <p> after the abstract
[23:23:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> mm yes, I guess it's not meant to assume that the first paragraph counts if it's after a heading
[23:23:12] <gwern> so there is no 'first paragraph' to dropcap. it just goes straight to the first header and the story
[23:23:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, so that's why that body class is having no effect

[23:32:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Probably it's worth adding a note in default.css, the part that talks about the drop caps implementation, that the body class does not itself have any effect via CSS, but rather causes the classes to be applied to blocks (via JS), which is why the selectors below that note are all local, as it were
[23:33:38] <gwern> vok
[23:34:15] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: we do this to support dropcaps in arbitrary places?
[23:35:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> The opposite: we do it to support dropcaps in a specific place, namely at page start (such that we don't have to construct increasingly tortured CSS selectors to define "page start", and such that "page start" can apply to loaded content such as popups - in theory - etc.)
[23:36:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> The "arbitrary places" version is supported directly by the CSS, because you can just put a `drop-cap-whatever` (note the singular!) on a block, via pandoc or w/e
[23:37:24] <gwern> ok
[23:39:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... what the fuck
[23:39:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> MDN got a redesign
[23:39:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> And now it's fucking broken
[23:39:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList ... look at this shit
[23:39:37] <Robomot> Element.classList - Web APIs | MDN (The Element.classList is a read-only property that / returns a live DOMTokenList collection of the class / attributes of the element. This can then be used to manipulate the class list.)
[23:40:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Where is the ToC at the left, the nav menu??
[23:40:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh but at least it has a dark mode toggle!! Gee thanks
[23:40:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And of course it's the dumb two-state one)
[23:40:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why is the body text set in like 900 weight
[23:41:32] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, donating to russia is borderline illegal
[23:41:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Goddamnit, they finally did it. They broke MDN. We knew this was coming but this is still a tragedy :(
[23:42:00] <gwern> kuudes: 'to thunderous applause', as the star wars line goes
[23:42:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Yes thank you mr. wet blanket
[23:42:13] <kuudes> but. #lw-politics
[23:44:14] <quanticle> You can complain about GrubHub asking you to donate to Ukraine, but only in #lw-politics
[23:44:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... I see, it's all super fucking bold because their font stack is... goddamnit
[23:44:24] <quanticle> Also, why are you using GrubHub
[23:44:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: -_-
[23:44:28] <quanticle> Just... go outside
[23:44:31] <quanticle> And get your goddamn food
[23:44:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> NO
[23:44:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle are you suggesting that I should take time away from working on gwern.net
[23:44:56] <quanticle> You're not a gen-z degenerate! Have some self-respect!
[23:44:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> You monster
[23:45:17] <kuudes> oh yeah, payday is on tuesday
[23:45:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> font-family: Inter,BlinkMacSystemFont,"Segoe UI","Roboto","Oxygen","Ubuntu","Cantarell","Fira Sans","Droid Sans","Helvetica Neue",sans-sans; ... what is even happening here
[23:45:44] <kuudes> thanks for reminding
[23:45:45] <quanticle> Have you considered that gwern.net is *not* the most important thing you could be doing?
[23:45:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Ridiculous
[23:45:56] <gwern> ("sans-sans"?)
[23:46:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I DON'T KNOW
[23:46:15] <gwern> if you are sans the sans, is that 'serif' or... something else
[23:46:21] <kuudes> {}
[23:46:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh my god, these fuckers
[23:46:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> They added BlinkMacSystemFont, which works for Chrome, but NOT system-ui, which works for Firefox
[23:47:13] <gwern> quanticle: making MDN better would be more valuable (probably) but the problem is that the people who have made MDN worse would need to sign off on obormot making it better, but if they could do that...
[23:47:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is MDN we're talking about. MDN! The MOZILLA Developer Network!
[23:47:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Do they test their site on MOZILLA Firefox??
[23:47:32] <quanticle> Absolutely not
[23:47:40] <quanticle> That would require them to *use* Mozilla Firefox
[23:47:40] <kuudes> latest update to firefox somehow broke downloading stuff from internet
[23:47:42] <gwern> quanticle: at least when it comes to gwern.net, I only talk back a little and I approve like 95% of the changes
[23:48:55] <gwern> quanticle: something like hamming's point about research topics: stuff like timetravel or FTL is far more important than what you are working on, but you don't have an attack on them
[23:49:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> And as far as I can tell, "sans-sans" is not a thing. They just fucked up.
[23:49:54] <quanticle> One of these days, feep and Obormot\Arcturus will start a web design firm. They'll make the most interesting websites, backed by interesting technology, but the company will flame out because their clients will be all like, "Yes, it's very nice, but we asked for a React website with a backend in Python, and you gave us a pile of raw HTML and a backend in some homebrew programming language we've
[23:49:56] <quanticle> never heard of."
[23:50:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[23:50:46] <gwern> now now. it'd be in PHP *generated* by neat
[23:50:59] <quanticle> And Obormot\Arcturus will be like, "But the fonts are correct! I could not make correct fonts in *React*, you cretins!"
[23:51:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok I guess I need a... new reference... or something?
[23:51:30] <quanticle> Take the black pill and use w3schools.com
[23:51:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah. Guess so.

[23:56:36] <Robomot> Fish Swimming (It has taken a couple of years but finally I understand Viktor Schauberger’s comment that has stuck in my mind ever since I read it: “fish don’t’ swim, they’re swum”)
