[02:03:28] <slaughter> I've finally done it! I have totally and completely killed dotenv and .env files in all repos in our org. Jesus christ on a hamburger bun that was no fun
[02:05:57] <rawtaz> lol
[02:06:45] <rawtaz> let me guess - the idiots that had committed those dirs/files are people who cant use git properly and instead of committing only the lines they should, do stuff like `git add .`
[02:10:37] *** Quits: Snegodick (~ne@user/Snegodick) (Quit: Going offline, see ya! (www.adiirc.com))
[02:11:13] <rawtaz> traefik 2.6 is out :)
[02:13:08] <slaughter> Dude I wish
[02:13:22] <slaughter> Almost always _some_ version of .env in the repo, yeah
[02:13:37] <slaughter> But whether that's prod, dev, staging, or example values was just totally all over the place
[02:15:04] <rawtaz> i seriously dont understand why they do that. the only thing they have to do is simple - only add/commit what you actually changed and that should be in the repo
[02:15:12] <rawtaz> there is simply *no reason* to add .env stuff or similar
[02:15:16] <slaughter> And the suuuuuuuuuuuuper fun part was that a lot of this stuff hadn't been deployed in 6...8...12...14...even 18 months. And those devs? No longer with us. And the people that were here back then? Lol no they don't have .env files for some weird crap whathisname spun up 2 years ago and no they don't know what it does either and no there is no documentation
[02:15:43] <rawtaz> lol
[02:15:46] <slaughter> .env.example is the only valid one. Even in non-dotenv projects it's not a bad idea
[02:15:48] <rawtaz> what a joy
[02:16:01] <slaughter> It's been a 6 month project off and on
[02:16:02] <rawtaz> yeah example files, that doesnt contain anything sensitive, is good :)
[02:16:15] <slaughter> Lots of "why is this part of our site down" :)
[02:16:28] <rawtaz> so how did you deal with the repos that had it. you basically added commits that removed them i take it?
[02:16:54] <slaughter> Yeah. Have considered doing one of the many ways of scrubbing git history to remove them entirely
[02:17:42] <rawtaz> seems rather pointless - theyre to be considered compromised anyway. better change the sensitive stuff thats in there and just move on
[02:17:43] <slaughter> But my primary concern was removing the dependency to accompany our switch to a secrets management service, so that was not at all a priority
[02:17:53] <rawtaz> yeah good
[02:18:02] <rawtaz> what did you switch to in terms of secrets management?
[02:18:21] <slaughter> Yup. And joke's on whever gets those files because lol they're probably for staging but actually staging from 2 years ago
[02:18:22] <slaughter> Doppler
[02:19:20] <rawtaz> oh :i
[02:19:23] <rawtaz> luxury
[02:19:45] <slaughter> It's pretty nice. And we get a free upgraded account because they put our company name on somehting once
[02:20:12] <slaughter> I have yet to find evidence of that at all, other than them saying that and us having free stuff
[02:20:22] <rawtaz> :>
[02:20:32] <rawtaz> their CEO tattooed it on his ass
[02:20:46] <slaughter> Anywhoo since it's my last 2 weeks I'm gonna fuck off for the last 2 hours of the day :)
[02:20:48] <slaughter> Peace!
[02:21:08] <rawtaz> nice :D

[22:22:55] <rawtaz> TIL i learnt about https://nixery.dev
[22:23:25] <rawtaz> slaughter: sweet! waiting for the 5k version, then i can justify buying a new monitor :>
[22:23:47] <slaughter> I rue the day I have to buy a new monitor
[22:23:56] <slaughter> My taste has become very expensive
[22:24:11] <slaughter> Hopefully I'll have a home office stipend or something 
[22:26:39] <rawtaz> hehe
[22:29:36] <dodo> eh, i've only just upgraded to 4k
[22:29:49] <slaughter> 1440p good enough for me. As long it's a wide boi
[22:29:58] <dodo> (my accountant told me i should spend more money..)
[22:30:07] <slaughter> I'm this like crazy person that likes to be able to read and see what I'm doing
[22:30:22] <slaughter> Instead of straining my eyes for 8+ hours a day
[22:30:44] <dodo> what makes it more readable for you? that it's wide?
[22:31:33] <slaughter> Ah no, though also a bit yes (because I can properly have enough things on the screen)
[22:32:00] <slaughter> I find 4k monitors to be pretty superfluous for my workflows, because I turn scaling and font size up enough that it's basically like working on a 1440 screen anyway
[22:32:13] <slaughter> And then it's not a wide boi so I end up with only 1 or 2 things on the screen at a time
[22:32:22] <slaughter> As opposed to my widescreen with 3-5 things
[22:33:27] <dodo> my wallpapers are really hi res now. not that i see them often though
[22:33:32] <dodo> oh right, the lock screen too
[22:33:57] <slaughter> lol yeah I used to be a huge wallpaper nerd but I haven't seen mine other than the 5 seconds of lock screen before the display turns off in like 2 years
