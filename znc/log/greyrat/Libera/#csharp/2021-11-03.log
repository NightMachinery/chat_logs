[03:44:44] <AbleBacon> well shit i got about a dozen of 'em
[03:46:21] <AbleBacon> the ones i need to garbage collect have a "dictionary" under them, while the ones i want to keep have a "hashset" under them. is there any way i can leverage that information?
[03:47:02] <Suchiman> AbleBacon: that you know because you've noticed that from the memory dump or this is something you know from code?
[03:47:23] <AbleBacon> from the memory dump
[03:48:03] <Suchiman> AbleBacon: well you can search the code for the location where you might be using a Dictionary<MyType> and then analyze it why it keeps things alive it shouldn't
[03:48:23] <AbleBacon> it's a ui element, so it's got tons of built-in stuff in it i think
[03:49:05] <Suchiman> AbleBacon: ah yeah, if the Dictionary is an implementation detail of the UI element, then prolly look one level up, what's using the Dictionary
[03:50:51] <AbleBacon> ok thanks for all the help!
[03:51:46] <Suchiman> AbleBacon: if in doubt, look at the src of the ui element and figure out when and why elements are being put into the dic and stop that from happening
[03:54:41] <AbleBacon> ok it's this DependencyPropertyDescriptor
[03:54:47] <AbleBacon> i took it out and now it garbage collects fine
[03:57:50] <Suchiman> AbleBacon: cool
[03:58:20] <AbleBacon> is there a way to like... remove the DependencyPropertyDescriptor when the garbage collector comes to check on the object or something?
[03:59:20] <AbleBacon> or like... the CollectionViewSource makes my UI element go away, but it doesn't destroy it. is there a way i can tie in to that "going away" behavior so it's ready to be GC'd?
[03:59:42] <Suchiman> AbleBacon: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23682232/how-can-i-fix-the-dependencypropertydescriptor-addvaluechanged-memory-leak-on-at ?
[04:00:28] <AbleBacon> thanks
[04:00:35] <AbleBacon> ughghghgh god i wish there was just a simple way to do things like in qt

[13:27:47] <jmer> well it could've gone better, the guys we hired to move for us was quite slow
[13:28:00] <jmer> it's the same company we used last time we moved and then it took 7 hours, this time around 10-11 hours
[13:28:11] <jmer> and the amount of furniture is aobut the same.
[13:28:31] <jmer> and the moving company had all kinds of requirements that they didn't communicate to us
[13:29:06] <MatthiasVance> Oh that sucks, like what?
[13:29:26] <jmer> well the moving guys called their omther company to say that we weren't "ready" to move
[13:29:35] <jmer> because we still had to pack a few boxes while they were moving all the other stuff
[13:29:51] <jmer> ... and they also said that we weren't prepared bacause a table in our living room was in the way
[13:29:58] <jmer> but they didn't say anything like this to us.
[13:30:09] <jmer> they didn't give any constructive feedback as to how to do stuff the best way possible
[13:30:57] <Kim^J> jmer: NO INTERNET?!
[13:31:11] <jmer> they also broke our voliere for the guineapigs but it was cheap to fix.

[13:31:44] <Kim^J> Ouch, that's cheap
[13:31:48] <jmer> but my manager is sick

[13:32:36] <Kim^J> Aren't the cheapest like 10G these days?
[13:33:18] <jmer> I can see on the iPhone 11 they gave me that it has used 1 GB
[13:33:31] <Kim^J> The cheapest my employer has is 3GB
[13:33:58] <jmer> and then I got the message "you've used all data, now you can get 120 Kbit/sec or pay <exorbitant amount> for 10GB extra"
[13:34:20] <Kim^J> Our "cheap" brand has 8GB as the lowest
[13:34:26] <jmer> I expect it will be changed

[13:35:11] <jmer> well... I expect I will have that need at some point
[13:35:21] <Kim^J> I think mine's unlimited, since I'm expected to tether from it when not at the office
[13:36:00] <jmer> Also the connections they offer from work is like 200-300 Mbps and "enterprise" grade
[13:36:03] <jmer> but... fuck that shit
[13:36:12] <jmer> just give me a 1Gbps connection xD

[14:38:55] <MatthiasVance> Are you using VS?
[14:38:59] <alguien> no
[14:39:17] <MatthiasVance> Usually I use Application Insights to view related logs etc
[14:39:25] <MatthiasVance> But you could also scroll up in whatever is showing your EF logs
[14:39:39] <MatthiasVance> Supposedly there are other things logging in your application?

[14:41:50] <irwiss> alguien: may be it's time to consider the upgrade to serilog and similar frameworks that offer structured logging too
[14:42:19] <alguien> MatthiasVance, I understand what you mean. But determining the correct caller (let alone line, because there may be multiple queries in the same spot) would be much better
[14:42:39] <alguien> irwiss, is NLog not a structured logger?
[14:43:11] <irwiss> it tries to be, but iirc it's just draped over text logging
[14:43:30] <irwiss> fwiw you can just text-search those warnings in ef github
[14:44:02] <alguien> irwiss, what good does that do me if you don't mind my asking?
[14:44:03] <irwiss> then try finding the file in vs and putting a breakpoint, if jump to source feature works, i think it worked for me once
[14:44:08] *** Joins: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb)
[14:44:39] <irwiss> you can try breakpoint where it raises the log entry, if your vs manages to open the source for ef assembly
[14:44:46] <alguien> irwiss, oh, well the problem is I reckon we have loads of these lines. I'd like the tester to go through the whole product, and I can collect the logs afterwards and fix what needs fixing
[14:45:19] <MatthiasVance> Do you have a centralized logging system?
[14:45:24] <MatthiasVance> Like Application Insights
[14:45:56] <alguien> MatthiasVance, we use Sentry if that qualifies. But we're not sending everything there
[14:46:26] <irwiss> alguien: if you have the warning id you could try to make it throw in the ef core config, then go one by one, not sure if you can do them in bulk
[14:46:43] <alguien> I think it just catches exceptions on this project
[14:48:03] <alguien> irwiss, yeah the thought occurred to me, seems like an overkill. Not sure how well it will work with the systems, seems this project tends to ignore exceptions too
[14:48:08] <irwiss> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/logging-events-diagnostics/simple-logging or make your own mini-logger that'll save the callstack
[14:51:00] <alguien> irwiss, yep, will have to continue looking into a custom logger, hopefully it can do what I want. If it doesn't, I'll try raising exceptions. If all else fails, I'll fall back to MatthiasVance's advice

[15:44:07] <ki9a> You're doing something wrong.
[15:44:20] <jonp> MaNa2k: my guess is that you have a file with the "global statements" (or whatever) in use
[15:44:24] <jonp> so remove that file
[15:44:36] <jonp> the default `dotnet new console` template uses them, in Program.cs
[15:44:45] <bomb> climate change is real.
[15:44:49] <bomb> ^ global statement kekek
[15:44:54] <jonp> MaNa2k: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/top-level-templates
[15:45:19] <MaNa2k> so this is what i get https://ibb.co/SNCXQXB
[15:45:27] <MaNa2k> when i create a simple .net 6 console project
[15:45:29] <jonp> right
[15:45:34] <MaNa2k> and i cant add new methods
[15:45:41] <jonp> so if you want a "normal" Main, wrap line 2 in your class + Main
[15:45:42] <jonp> it builds
[15:46:06] <MaNa2k> ah
[15:46:13] <MaNa2k> so basically im already inside the main
[15:46:20] <jonp> yup
[15:46:30] <jonp> it's having *both* top-level statements *and* a separate Main() which causes problems
[15:46:33] <MaNa2k> so i basically just need to make classes instead of methods now
[15:46:43] <jonp> you needed to make classes anyway?
[15:47:28] <MaNa2k> yes but sometimes a short methods do the job, and theres no point in creating classes for that
[15:47:40] <jonp> and you're still confusing me
[15:47:50] <jonp> in C3, *how* does one have a "short method" without a containing class?
[15:47:52] <jonp> C#
[15:48:32] <Suchiman> jonp: local functions inside the global program ;)
[15:48:40] <jonp> yes, that should work too

[18:08:35] <_Shurik_> wait, that's serialize
[18:09:08] <_Shurik_> that's opposite of parsing json
[18:09:25] <MaNa2k> well i usually do deserialize to a strongly typed class
[18:09:44] <_Shurik_> okay, so what's the problem with \r\n?
[18:09:45] <MaNa2k> but was doing some tests, and cant seems to get something simple as this to work
[18:10:07] <canton7> What makes you think it isn't working?
[18:10:11] <canton7> We don't have a clear problem statement yet
[18:10:38] <MaNa2k> _Shurik_, so when i load the json to string, i get these \r\n and proably other stuff i cant see, they are messing with something im doing further in code
[18:10:50] <MaNa2k> so i want to rememve them somehow, but not manually like replace
[18:11:07] <Kim^J> MaNa2k: Are you deserializing or serializing?
[18:11:24] <MaNa2k> i have a json file on disk
[18:11:29] <MaNa2k> which i want to load to string
[18:11:36] <MaNa2k> but when i do i get these \r\n
[18:11:47] <MaNa2k> ah i see
[18:11:47] * _Shurik_ is not following
[18:11:50] <Kim^J> string jsonString = File.ReadAllText(path);
[18:11:54] <MaNa2k> im doing it wrong, lol
[18:12:08] <MaNa2k> Kim^J, yea that also gives me \r\n
[18:12:16] <Kim^J> MaNa2k: Where?
[18:12:19] <Kim^J> Inside "" ?
[18:12:20] <MaNa2k> in string
[18:12:21] <MaNa2k> yes
[18:12:33] <MaNa2k> so i was trying to use jsonconvert somehow to remove them
[18:12:36] <Kim^J> So you end up with {"a":"a\r\nb"} ?
[18:13:16] <Kim^J> If that's the case, just deserialize it.
[18:13:20] <MaNa2k> bmore like
[18:13:20] <MaNa2k> "{\r\n    \"inputs\": [{\r\n            \.....

[18:13:38] <_Shurik_> so what?
[18:13:45] <Kim^J> Well... That's what the JSON looks like... So... ?
[18:13:48] <gufi_> _Shurik_, !
[18:13:54] <_Shurik_> those should be ignored when deserilization happen
[18:13:57] <_Shurik_> gufi_: !

[18:14:49] <MaNa2k> hmm, im begining to think maybe it isnt the json's fault
[18:15:05] <Kim^J> Yeah...
[18:15:09] <shadowchaser> MaNa2k maybe let's start with what you're doing with this string
[18:15:36] <MaNa2k> basically adding it to a dictionary<string, object>()
[18:15:42] <MaNa2k> on the object side
[18:16:17] <shadowchaser> and how \r\n is messing it?
[18:16:29] <MaNa2k> then posting it to an api
[18:16:42] <MaNa2k> shadowchaser, not quite sure how, but its a hunch
[18:17:03] <_Shurik_> when you manually remove those, API works fine?
[18:17:09] <MaNa2k> because when i test the same query in a web-sandbox, it works
[18:17:37] <MaNa2k> anyway, i think im gonna have a closer look
[18:17:37] <_Shurik_> well I mean... replace \r\n in the json string then with blank

[18:26:55] <constxd> ok so i have two properties, HasExtendedHeader and UseStoredSettings. when both of them are true, i want all of my form elements to be disabled. so you're telling me i have to go into the XAML and for every single form element i need to add <IsEnabled><MultiBinding Converter="{converters:AndConverter}"><Binding Path="HasExtendedHeader"/><Binding Path="UseStoredSettings"/></MultiBinding></IsEnabled>

[18:43:49] <constxd> too bad there is no way to give elements a common parent without affecting layout
[18:44:05] <niston> we've passed peak software somewhen back in the early 2000s, it went all downhill from there.
[18:45:16] <MizMahem> You could also use a dependent property, lots of ways really.
[18:45:28] <constxd> what's a dependent property
[18:45:44] <MizMahem> Gah, on mobile, to much to explain
[18:45:48] <MizMahem> Giyf
[18:47:21] <constxd> oh you mean like a property called CanEditSettings with a setter that calls OnPropertyChanged("CanEditSettings") ?
[18:48:16] <constxd> then i still have to assign to CanEditSettings in all of the places i otherwise would have had to call OnPropertyChanged("CanEditSettings")
[18:48:30] <MizMahem> No um... It's a view thing
[18:49:34] <MizMahem> But in general handling these kinds of behavior mappings is what you expect the VM to do.
[18:50:55] <constxd> if this framework didn't suck i'd be able to write something like this
[18:51:08] <jmer> lol
[18:52:23] <constxd> CanEditSettings = () => !HasExtendedHeader || !UseStoredSettings;
[18:52:37] <constxd> and it would dedude that CanEditSettings depends on both of the other properties
[18:55:15] <constxd> there should be like a property dependency graph

[19:00:18] <interop_madness> isn't that unbearbly little money, given the cost of living in most US cities?
[19:00:24] <interop_madness> not even talking about inflation
[19:00:42] <edcba> well inflation is good when you have no money
[19:00:46] <interop_madness> many people are arguing even double that would be low balling
[19:01:07] <edcba> of course you still need to get a good job then
[19:02:25] <MizMahem> constxd: so again, you can do that. You use a multi-converter and then you can bind to more than one property. The syntax is a bit verbose, but that's XAML for you.
[19:02:29] <MizMahem> You can instead handle the logic in the VM, that's what it's there for. It doesn't have to be hard, in the set method of those two properties, emit an INPC notice for the property that depends on them. You can check the logic or just emit it even if it hasn't changed, likely isn't going to hurt anything.
[19:02:46] <interop_madness> that seems to be one of the things that are entering stage: the notion that there really are no low-skill jobs and that they all should be compensated such that the worker can afford a decent life
[19:02:48] <MizMahem> You could even have you VM subscribe to its own events and do the logic there if you wanted to I guess.
[19:03:22] <MizMahem> You can have one control follow the properties of another control using `RelativeSource` or `ElementName` bindings.
[19:03:37] <MizMahem> This is very common for say something like a checkbox and IsEnabled.
[19:04:19] <MizMahem> Often if controls are going to follow one another in behavior they are visually grouped, so you can just bind from a parent.
[19:04:23] <edcba> there are low skilled jobs that should be suppressed though
[19:05:15] <constxd> MizMahem: thanks king
[19:05:20] <interop_madness> suppressed?
[19:05:35] <interop_madness> as in depressed w.r.t. wages?
[19:05:42] <edcba> as removed
[19:05:50] <interop_madness> yeah
[19:05:54] <edcba> can't find a good word
[19:05:54] <MizMahem> You can write a custom control and expose a property that it's children will follow. Anyways, you've got options.
[19:06:21] <MizMahem> FWIW I feel some of your pain. It's one of the reasons I like Avalonia, as it removes some of the syntax pain in operations like these, cutting down on the verbosity.
[19:09:27] <constxd> actually making the VM subscribe to its own events was something i thought about earlier but i wasn't sure if that was considered an odd thing to do
[19:09:30] <constxd> or some kind of anti-pattern
[19:09:53] <constxd> it makes the dependency graph more explicit though instead of scattering OnPropertyChanged calls around various setters
[19:09:57] <constxd> might do that

[23:15:54] <constxo> i'm not spreading any false info
[23:16:33] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: i'm a beans & brews fan, mainly because there is one 1000 feet closer to me than a starbucks
[23:16:47] <khanred> starbucks tastes like shit anyway
[23:16:50] <brianonymous_> i like the starbucks frozen mochas
[23:17:10] <brianonymous_> i think we have a dunkins pretty close too
[23:17:12] <khanred> brianonymous_ is a confirmed basic white girl
[23:17:15] <brianonymous_> lol
[23:17:24] <JakeSays> LOL
[23:17:28] <brianonymous_> i average about one every 6 months :D
[23:17:33] <Nasp> bomb:  Yeah i've never understood that in the states
[23:17:44] <JakeSays> khanred: basic white girls drink frozen mochas?
[23:18:01] <khanred> JakeSays, That's what they tell me
[23:18:05] <JakeSays> LOL
[23:18:22] <brianonymous_> i really only like it cuz its like a milkshake, and i like milkshakes
[23:18:40] <brianonymous_> now i want a milkshake
[23:18:44] <Nasp> Vanilla ice latte!
[23:18:46] <Nasp> It's great
[23:18:51] <Nasp> Or Vanilla latte
[23:18:57] <khanred> If I drink a milkshake I'll be in pain for like 48 hours
[23:19:01] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: jamocha shake from arby's. yum
[23:19:03] <constxo> kings, let's say I have something like this: <Grid> ... <A1/><A2/><A3/> <B1/><B2/><B3/> ... </Grid> where sometimes the As are visible and other times the Bs are visible. I want to extract the inner part to separate UserControls
[23:19:07] <brianonymous_> JakeSays: mmmmm
[23:19:18] <jmer> homemade milkshake is the best
[23:19:48] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: your tail is showing
[23:19:50] <constxo> so I have write <Grid> ... <ControlA/ IsEnabled={Binding A}> <ControlB IsEnabled={Binding !A}/> ... </Grid>

[23:20:38] <brianonymous_> constxo: i dont follow the last bit. extract the whowhat
[23:20:51] <constxo> but A1, A2, etc. originally had Grid.Row and Grid.Column specified on them. How do I set their grid row/column if they're in a separate UserControl
[23:21:43] <brianonymous_> wouldnt that be the parent? i dunno tbh
[23:22:18] <constxo> brianonymous_: basically i have some part of the interface that can change between a few different versions based on some variable. instead of having all 3 versions in the same XAML file i want to break them into 3 different ones and then in the main XAML file, i'll just reference them
[23:23:22] <constxo> fuck i hate WPF and XAML
[23:23:47] <brianonymous_> oh, dont you do that with templates in wpf?
[23:24:25] <brianonymous_> ..or at least one of the ways
[23:25:27] <bomb> constxo don't say that, it's still the best we got
[23:25:32] <Nasp> bomb:  I wonder if kids are forced to take it if their parents want them to have it

[23:26:18] <bomb> Pfizer submitted vaccine data of 2000 kids to FDA. where did they get those data?
[23:26:37] <khanred> uh, clinical trials
[23:27:37] <JakeSays> Nasp: of course they would be
[23:28:34] <bomb> you mean, illegal clinical trials
[23:28:41] <khanred> no
[23:29:11] <brianonymous_> my son got the rona, but my daughter didnt... or she did and didnt notice
[23:29:24] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: he did? how is he?
[23:29:40] <brianonymous_> just fine now.. he was tired for 2 days with a mild grade fever and
[23:29:43] <brianonymous_> 'body tingles'
[23:29:53] <JakeSays> poor kid
[23:30:05] <brianonymous_> he said it was like people trying to tickle him. so weird.
[23:30:16] <JakeSays> that is weird
[23:30:29] <khanred> maybe check the locks on your doors
[23:30:33] <brianonymous_> lol
[23:30:49] <bomb> haha
[23:30:58] <JakeSays> lol
[23:31:25] <bomb> that's expected btw. VAERS DB is full of itchiness FWIW
[23:31:27] <JakeSays> i just have no tolerance for anti-vaxxers.
[23:32:33] <bomb> JakeSays why? people received so many mixed messages from the doctors during this period. it's healthy for people to be cautious rather than conformist

[23:33:32] <JakeSays> bomb: cautious is one thing. that's not an anti-vaxxer.
[23:34:01] <jmer> the only corona vaccine criticla doctors I've noticed in Denmark is the ones who earn money on SoMe by sowing discord
[23:35:02] <bomb> JakeSays most people I've seen just trying to determine what's best for themselves and their families. but some people respond to them as if they're bunch of sociopaths trying to endanger public health
[23:36:45] <JakeSays> there's crazies on both sides, for sure
[23:37:29] <JakeSays> we seem to have a unique brand of crazy here.
[23:37:53] <khanred> Like 70% of the world needs to be vaccinated against covid to reach herd immunity... We didn't eradicate polio by allowing people to pick and choose "what is best for them"

[23:39:35] <JakeSays> same with many other viruses
[23:39:54] <brianonymous_> in all honesty tho, i dont think this bad oscar is going anywhere

[23:40:33] <constxo> terminal TDS
[23:40:41] <brianonymous_> fortunately tho, in typical viral history, mutations have been less lethal. i think thats our path
[23:40:43] <bomb> constxo I know. he even tried compiling Qt on a Raspberry Pi once
[23:40:58] <constxo> probably watches Rachel Maddow
[23:41:01] <JakeSays> bomb: dude.. i didn't try. i succeeded!
[23:41:22] <bomb> JakeSays hah. how many weeks it took?
[23:41:25] <JakeSays> constxo: go fuck yourself, you mouth breather
[23:41:34] <constxo> LMAO
[23:42:10] <JakeSays> bomb: w/o building the web view iirc it took about 12 hours
[23:42:26] <bomb> ah, not terribly bad
[23:43:42] <JakeSays> bomb: web view probably would've added another 12
[23:44:37] <brianonymous_> weird ass question - anyone happen to have recommendations for a very good indoor air quality monitor?
[23:45:11] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: what constitutes air quality
[23:45:26] <jmer> JakeSays: less farts, more air?
[23:45:27] <brianonymous_> particulate detection is top priority
[23:45:37] <brianonymous_> but accurately
[23:45:40] <khanred> farts per million
[23:45:53] <JakeSays> jmer: well then there is no quality here
[23:45:54] <brianonymous_> a fart detector would not survive in this house
[23:45:58] <JakeSays> LOL
[23:46:04] <jmer> hah xD
[23:46:18] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: hmm. build one.
[23:46:29] <jmer> brianonymous_: I have such a device... I'm trying to find a link to the company who sold it but...
[23:46:35] <jmer> Not sure about particles though...
[23:46:41] <brianonymous_> i dont like the reliability uncertainty factor being tied directly to me
[23:47:11] <JakeSays> would be interesting to build one using a laser
[23:47:20] <brianonymous_> i did look into it, they make whole modules for it
[23:47:37] <brianonymous_> something like 40-50$
[23:47:40] <JakeSays> if you could get the beam small enough
[23:48:00] <brianonymous_> but ideally, i just want accurate datas
[23:48:06] <brianonymous_> calibrated, etc
[23:48:21] <JakeSays> get one they use in fab clean rooms
[23:48:46] <Nasp> JakeSays:  You dont with my 3d printer yet?

[23:50:07] <jmer> brianonymous_: I used to work for a sister company, to a company that made this small device that measured air quality, temperature, moisture etc.
[23:50:16] <jmer> but it doesn't seem like they sell the product anymore
[23:50:39] <jmer> the prototype used an rpi for a brain and some off the shelf sensors ( I assume)
[23:51:28] <JakeSays> have you seen the new rpi?
[23:52:16] <brianonymous_> ive been looking on amazon and all the ones i find are below 4 stars. and i get amazon anxiety
[23:52:32] <jmer>  brianonymous_ I hate that site
[23:52:36] <JakeSays> LOL @ amazon anxiety.
[23:52:40] <jmer> I always feel like I am being scammed

[23:53:18] <JakeSays> know exactly what you're talking about
[23:54:18] <jmer> hrmpf... seems that sister company startup thing didn't survive, atleast the domain tied to the product (they got one for every employee as a christmas present) doesn't exist anymore
[23:55:34] <brianonymous_> they probably got bad ratings on amazon
[23:55:38] <jmer> Now I have a bricked air quality measurer
[23:56:02] <JakeSays> jmer: you just bricked it?
[23:56:03] <jmer> brianonymous_: they were targeting large buildings... I doubt they sold their stuff on amazon. It was an integrated platform with data analysis tools included
[23:56:22] <jmer> but I kinda feel happy because the guy that was the CEO was a jerk ^^
[23:56:29] <JakeSays> lol
[23:57:06] <khanred> now his kids will starve
[23:58:19] <jmer> khanred: No... I guess he will have to maybe buy a 200€ bottle of wine instead of a 2000€ bottle of wine?
[23:58:45] <khanred> So basically you killed a man
[23:59:08] <jmer> I wasn't the reason the company dided
[23:59:10] <jmer> died*
