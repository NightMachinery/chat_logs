[03:05:26] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So what i tend to do(not a proficient compiler dev) is that now we know where it errors, we can see the ast by putting an echo before it errors, or you can use a debugger if you wish of course
[03:05:44] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So i put `echo resNode` before that attempt of getting sym
[03:06:21] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> rather `echo resNode.kind`
[03:07:16] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Ok so we see in the case it errors it has an `nkEmpty` in that AST position, so now we need to see why it's empty, when it expects a node
[03:09:27] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> Where did you put it? Nimdata 355?
[03:09:47] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> No in the compiler

[03:13:24] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> Oh ok
[03:15:10] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> Are you sure it's that method?
[03:15:40] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> That's the method AST that it echos as it compiles
[03:15:52] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> doing `echo prc.ast` before i attempt to get the sym
[03:16:17] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3w2i
[03:18:47] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> So how does the compiler error relate to this?
[03:19:16] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> for some reason using that code results in the `result` being `nkEmpty` instead of a `nkSym`
[03:20:03] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So the thing to do is now figure out why and i reason it's the iterator result with an import or the using statement
[03:20:44] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> Why do you think that?
[03:21:03] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Cause those are the only two things that make sense to why the AST would be odd
[03:21:50] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I mean this is all just guessing i havent confirmed it

[03:26:36] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So it seems the issue is a `[T]` plus `DataFrame[NonT]`

[21:31:44] <FromDiscord> <zidsal> just to check before I reinvent the wheel, I need a bit set > 1 uint64 does nim have a bitset library like java? or do I need to make my own with a sequence of ints?
[21:32:34] <FromDiscord> <zidsal> (edit) "java?" => "java (from what I can see the `set` module won't work due to size limitations)?"
[21:42:13] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> built in set type has type limitation but sets module don't.
[21:43:29] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Sets module is not bitset I believe so if you strictly need bitsets…
[21:50:15] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Nim integers aren’t big ints either, how does the Java one work?
[21:55:57] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> In reply to @arkanoid "i've been spending days": Do you mean to "Error: invalid type: 'UncheckedArray[char]' for var". What was the original procedure/field/variable definition?
[21:56:34] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> c2nim does not make very smart choices sometimes, so it is important to know the context

[22:02:48] <madprops> why does: from sugar import collect as col
[22:02:49] <madprops> doesn't work?
[22:03:47] <FromDiscord> <proud linux user> (why is it named sugar)
[22:03:49] <madprops> or, how can I import something without polluting the namespace
[22:04:03] <FromDiscord> <proud linux user> we have namescape in nim?
[22:04:11] <FromDiscord> <proud linux user> (edit) "namescape" => "namespace"
[22:06:09] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> some people really care about writing `package.proc` everywhere
[22:06:24] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> And being able to just `proc` considered polluting namespace
[22:06:36] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> something like that
[22:07:04] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> In reply to @madprops "why does: from sugar": and no, IIRC you can rename package on import, but not identifier from it. So `from sugar as s imprt collect`
[22:07:06] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `s.collect`
[22:07:07] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> In reply to @richard stallmen(crazy GNU guy) "we have namespace in": it's called modules
[22:07:55] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Though `from std/sugar import collect as c` would be also nice to have, at least for the purpose of consistency
[22:08:02] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I think I've seen RFC/PR that enables it
[22:08:24] <madprops> but what if I want to import the sugar stuff but have to use it with "sugar.something" instead of all on the namespace?
[22:08:34] <madprops> or is that not possible
[22:08:37] <madprops> im reading https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/2738
[22:08:47] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> `from std/sugar umport nil`
[22:09:03] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> (edit) "umport" => "import"
[22:09:11] <madprops> i see
