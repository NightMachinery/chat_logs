[23:10:19] <eof> This may belong in #raku-dev - I haven't bothered to check and probably should, but how adept is the "reference" lexer at handling incomplete/invalid syntax? I'm trying to think of approaches to effectively implementing some language support and due to some of the fine details and complexity in the language's grammar and I keep coming back to the idea of using the reference lexer. Frustratingly, there are still benefits to implementing a lighter and more naive lexer (
