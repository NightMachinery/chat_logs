[00:40:37] <bomb> not bad at all
[00:43:58] <Slade> Just thinking about that buyout. now are all you World of Warcraft users going to end up with Clippy pets?
[00:44:45] <lz_> companies shouldn't be able to buy companies
[00:44:48] <brianonymous> if you ask the minecraft people how they felt, they ended up not so happy
[00:45:22] <lz_> when has it lead to anything but shit
[00:45:24] <brianonymous> if you premitted acquisions, theyd just find other ways to do it
[00:45:31] <brianonymous> premitted, lawl. i need a nap
[00:45:35] <brianonymous> preVENTED.
[00:45:51] <Slade> <lz_> when has it lead to anything but shit  <-- when microsoft bought xamarin? :P
[00:47:10] <Slade> actually by default companies don't buy other companies.. they usually just buy the assets of the companies
[00:47:30] <Slade> buying the company itself is bad news, so usually only done for public companies, etc
[00:48:32] <brianonymous> never under estimate the sheer tenacity of human greed
[00:48:56] <_genuser_> hola muchachos
[00:49:01] <brianonymous> hola
[00:49:25] <_genuser_> how's things going?
[00:49:32] <brianonymous> sleepy. you?
[00:49:33] <lz_> I was looking for some software the other day; looked promising. Clicked on the company url: "bought by unity"
[00:49:38] <lz_> same with adobe etc
[00:49:41] <lz_> fuck them
[00:49:59] <_genuser_> brianonymous flu. taking vacation from work.
[00:50:06] <brianonymous> flovid?
[00:50:45] <brianonymous> i have to head to the west coast next week, im pretty sure im fucked
[00:50:56] <_genuser_> not sure what makes a flovid. But this is the third day of this and the first two were horrible.
[00:51:05] <_genuser_> right now, I'm probably on a tylenol high.
[00:51:07] <_genuser_> I had an interview.
[00:51:15] <lz_> imagine a world where developers would unite to build better opensource alternatives *and* would be paid by people to do it
[00:51:24] <Inge> crazy
[00:51:25] <lz_> and we'd take down all these huge companies one by one
[00:51:25] <_genuser_> I was afraid I was going to start quoting captain janeway or something half way through.
[00:52:41] <_genuser_> lz_ lol, it's your fantasy. So which company would take down first?
[00:52:50] <bomb> https://mobile.twitter.com/billgates/status/1483487041677524994
[00:52:57] <bpmedley> lz_ : What's wrong with unity buying them?  How were you effected?
[00:53:05] <lz_> _genuser_: from the top of my head, I'd be fine with burning adobe to the ground
[00:53:20] <_genuser_> I'm not a big fan of adobe, gotta say.
[00:53:23] <lz_> bpmedley: changed their payment model from perpetual license to subscription shit for example
[00:53:27] <_genuser_> but premiere and photoshop are pretty great.
[00:53:40] <_genuser_> specifically premiere pro
[00:53:44] <bpmedley> lz_ : Too many subscriptions for sure
[00:53:46] <lz_> adobe is doing this subscription shit for everything, and prices are nasty
[00:54:05] <bpmedley> I'm thinking of just giving my paycheck away and have them buy food for me
[00:54:21] <bpmedley> (on a food subscription plan)
[00:55:11] <bomb> some guy on Twitter says Activision acquisition isn't the biggest news this week
[00:55:13] <_genuser_> I'd rather pay 4k for a piece of software and then keep it for 10years and keep using it. Instead of paying 20/mo for life. Sure you get new version for free, but you're never rid of the vendor. And you can't walkaway from the company
[00:55:57] <lz_> I'd rather have everything free like blender
[00:56:08] <bomb> _genuser_ Affinity + DaVinci Resolve, then
[00:56:16] <bomb> lz_++
[00:56:29] <_genuser_> bomb for premiere pro replacements?
[00:57:08] <bomb> _genuser_ DaVinci Resolve can replace both Premiere and After Effects. different workflow, but gets stuff done
[00:57:14] <_genuser_> I tried a good few when I had to create a movie 2-3years ago and the premiere pro ease of use was above others. And the workflow was very intuitive.
[00:57:30] <bomb> yeah Premiere is not bad at all
[00:57:35] <_genuser_> bomb I might have to go through the tutorials. I wouldn't mind a freeware. I have discontinued my premiere pro sub.
[00:58:03] <brianonymous> ive taken a liking to Hit Films Express. so much so i got the pro version
[00:58:13] <bomb> _genuser_ same, canceled my CC in 2018 or 19
[00:58:27] <brianonymous> HFE is a freebe for the basics
[00:58:55] <bomb> they  kinda gave away HitFilm Pro in a HumbleBundle sale for likr 30 bucks
[00:59:16] <_genuser_> bomb I use clip studio for painting and then krita. Krita is a bit of a nuisance in how the brushes are organized, but pretty nice overall.
[00:59:17] <bomb> renderer was dog slow for some reason
[00:59:25] <Slade> <brianonymous> never under estimate the sheer tenacity of human greed  <-- greed and fear, thats all there is
[00:59:47] <brianonymous> and doin it

[01:00:23] <bomb> _genuser_ CSP is a banger. I've been wanting to buy that for ages, for animation

[01:05:48] <irwiss> this prevents 100% sql injections :P
[01:06:26] <bomb> _genuser_ you mean clip studio ex, or anime studio (now Moho)?
[01:06:52] <_genuser_> right right the moho thing.
[01:07:17] <_genuser_> I had been meaning to buy it. But then I youtubed how to animate. I realized that's way too much drawing for my tastes.
[01:07:42] <_genuser_> drawing all the frames is too much work. But maybe south park style animation where the entire thing just slides here and there might be ok.
[01:10:27] <bomb> Moho was keyframe animation, they added frame-by-frame later. wanted CSP Ex for better frame-by-frame stuff
[01:11:50] <bomb> but both csp ex and moho pro to xpnsiv
[01:12:07] <_genuser_> I just read the csp licenses are perpetual.

[01:28:08] <irwiss> it's syntactically correct, whether it works is something else :P

[01:28:36] <Slade> thats about the right time.
[01:28:44] <Slade> magic_quotes was probably set to true

[01:29:27] <lz_> I said 10 years

[01:31:35] <bomb> can't click
[01:31:42] <bomb> just yes/no
[01:32:31] <irwiss> php is a security concern by default tbh
[01:32:56] <bomb> but facebook, youtube
[01:33:42] <Slade> irwiss, hum it depends heavily on the modules that are precompiled into your distros default binary really
[01:33:44] <MatthiasVance> Facebook doesn't run PHP, they just code in PHP
[01:34:13] <MatthiasVance> Also you can run PHP on .NET
[01:34:26] <MatthiasVance> Including Wordpress
[01:34:30] <irwiss> Slade: no, it's an insane language whose only advantage was that cheapass <$10 webhosting had php+mysql by default
[01:34:40] <Slade> https://www.w3schools.com/php/phptryit.asp?filename=tryphp_compiler
[01:34:45] <bomb> Facebook ran normal LAMP stack until 2010s though
[01:34:54] <irwiss> when the language itself is actively encouraging you to fuck up that's objectively bad language
[01:35:02] <MatthiasVance> bomb: Oh!
[01:35:36] <Slade> irwiss, well at its birth your choices were..  asp, cold fusion, php, perl
[01:36:12] <irwiss> it's birth was a while ago, people still code new projects in php, believe it or not
[01:36:28] <Slade> irwiss, i still hire COBOL developers
[01:36:37] <bomb> uhh people still code javascript and c
[01:37:03] <irwiss> here's an article from 2012-ish, vast majority of the bulletpoints are still valid in php 7 https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/
[01:37:25] <bomb> that article is pedantic
[01:37:33] <bomb> and 10 years old by now
[01:38:01] <irwiss> pedantic is exactly how i like my languages, c# is great at being pedantic and not fucking with me by ignoring exceptions, switching argument positions etc
[01:38:22] <bomb> C# is a different beast
[01:38:36] <Slade> irwiss, you have a distain for dynamically typed languages in general dont you
[01:38:38] <irwiss> and the fact it's 10 years old but still valid is in itself an argument against php :P
[01:38:39] <bomb> you'd compare PHP to Python, Ruby, Perl, etc. which aren't great either
[01:38:59] <lz_> perl gives me ptsd flashbacks
[01:39:02] <Slade> PHP solves specific use cases. i understand why it used today given its rapidness.  but i cant think of a use case for it for me in my toolbox anymore
[01:39:20] <irwiss> it solved one specific usecase - it was free on cheap webhosts
[01:39:42] <irwiss> while running asp wasn't even an option because windows license to run asp was already $$$
[01:39:50] <lz_> anyone remembers silverlight
[01:39:51] <Slade> irwiss, sure, when the choices were PHP, Perl, asp and coldfusion, it'll obviously be the cheapest
[01:39:53] <bomb> sounds like the rise of JS, Perl, C
[01:39:58] <irwiss> add on top is that classic asp sucked ass just as much as php did
[01:39:59] <Slade> lz_, poor silverlight
[01:40:14] <bomb> C is a thing because it's the language of UNIX
[01:40:29] <Slade> i used asp a ton. it was worse than php in many ways. tho i found its equality operators to be more... honest
[01:41:14] <bomb> I'm glad I don't need to touch any dynamic language right now
[01:41:48] <lz_> don't you like the thrills of discovering errors late at runtime though
[01:42:36] <Slade> i do prefer typescript over javascript, and kinda wish c# had some typscript functionality
[01:42:37] <lz_> the more time you waste the more money you make
[01:44:41] <irwiss> typescript has some neat features yep
[01:45:38] <irwiss> though IDE support is annoying, and javascript/npm as base is pretty shit

[06:15:15] <_genuser_> bpmedley I'm at a point to where if liberty mutual was the last insurance provider on the planet, I'd start a new insurance company to buy insurance. but not liberty mutual. hehe

[06:17:22] <_genuser_> bpmedley I was supposed to be watching netflix, but keep watching flying videos on youtube.....
[06:17:35] <_genuser_> the ads are going to force me off youtube for a bit. hehe.

[06:23:05] <bkool> wow, the flu. that's like a lottery win with all the omicron going around.
[06:23:18] <bkool> good you're doing ok. hopefully it's not too bad.
[06:24:20] <_genuser_> bkool seems better today. how's things with you?
[06:28:45] <bkool> _genuser_, doing well. lotta work projects going on at once but big one is localization. Converting our huge legacy application (C# webfroms, bleh) to support multiple languages. it's tedious work so using consultants for it.
[06:29:48] <_genuser_> I wonder if you'll find something interesting in all of that.
[06:31:12] <_genuser_> I just heard about Parallel.ForEach() today. Even though I've heard of TPL before but not of Parallel.* stuff.
[06:33:55] <bkool> _genuser_, there were a few things to figure out on a design level but not much. We got a greenfield application going as well in Vue.js with c# .net core backend so that's the fun new stuff. just not that big from impact standpoint.

[11:18:22] <darklambda> yeah... last resort would be to communicate via rest or middleware.. but was hoping a library bridge would exist
[11:19:05] <ki9a> darklambda: the real question is what library though.
[11:19:53] <darklambda> it's an internal library... so was thinking if there's exists a brdige library... like pythonnet for python
[11:24:28] <ki9a> you could technically load the Java runtime in .net
[11:24:36] <ki9a> I've done that once
[11:25:12] <ki9a> Only works on Windows due to how exceptions work
[11:28:12] <darklambda> ah... the usecase is i'll be running it in a linux container
[11:28:23] <ki9a> actually it might be that it works now too
[11:28:53] <darklambda> any reference implementation on it?
[11:31:07] <ki9a> Seems that it IS supported now

[13:12:07] <ki9a> JakeSays: how is your LLVM -> CIL compiler doing
[13:12:13] <jmer> JakeSays: If you ask about anyone who's not into code, they would probably disagree. Are you aware how many geeky traits I had to suppress/hide in order to get laid in my early 20s?
[13:13:01] <JakeSays> ki9a: you mean my c++ -> c# translator?
[13:13:09] <ki9a> yes
[13:13:24] <ki9a> Which btw is actually quite doable
[13:13:31] <ki9a> you just have to explode the generics
[13:13:36] <ki9a> aka templates
[13:13:56] <ki9a> you cannot translate templates to generics, instead you have to expand them compiletime
[13:13:59] <JakeSays> hah. it's not. i abandoned that project months ago. the client decided it wasn't worth the money
[13:14:12] <ki9a> oh someone actually considered paying for it?
[13:14:12] <JakeSays> ki9a: you can translate some templates to generics
[13:14:17] <ki9a> yes but not all
[13:14:19] <ki9a> which is the problem relaly.
[13:14:39] <ki9a> I'd actually love to have some rust code working on .net
[13:14:42] <ki9a> but life's too short.
[13:14:44] <ki9a> :)
[13:15:35] <jmer> When fetching stuff from a database and mapping to your DTOs... Does String.Intern actually make a difference?
[13:15:39] <JakeSays> but the biggest issue i had was rider couldn't handle debugging c# code that interacted with libclang
[13:16:14] <JakeSays> ki9a: you could come out with a rust compiler for your platform and call it naval jelly
[13:17:19] <ki9a> rust has a lot of weirdness
[13:17:26] <JakeSays> jmer: in 23 years of working with .net i have never used string.intern
[13:17:33] <ki9a> you cna't really "translatE" it to say c#
[13:17:42] <ki9a> but you could compile it to llvm -> cil
[13:18:07] <JakeSays> ki9a: well i was suggesting a compiler, not a translator
[13:18:12] <ki9a> that way the rust compiler deals with all the weirdness
[13:18:30] <ki9a> the only tricky bit here will be to translate llvm registers to stack based
[13:18:37] <ki9a> efficiently.
[13:19:14] <JakeSays> ki9a: just change the stack spiller to spill everything
[13:19:19] <jmer> JakeSays: I'm a bit weirded out why it's used here... It's just plain old code to fetch DB records... I never had the use for that either...
[13:20:04] <JakeSays> jmer: i'm guessing someone doesn't understand what it's used for, or is pico-optimizing

[13:34:37] <dan01> I think GNU is important
[13:34:42] <ejjfunky> it'll all be closed source
[13:35:07] <JakeSays> i dunno. i think it's over rated
[13:35:09] <dan01> Guys I'm shitting my pants here, come one throw some C# questions at me, seriously
[13:35:31] <dan01> Oh yeah, I wanted to ask, I really don't get the role of IEquatable interface
[13:35:47] <ejjfunky> Just remember the days before Satya Nadella (specifically Steve Balmer)
[13:35:50] <JakeSays> dan01: you should get it. it's important
[13:35:55] <megaTherion> dan01: why wouldnt you :)
[13:36:02] <ejjfunky> M$ was in a witch hunt mode then.
[13:36:13] <JakeSays> ejjfunky: it wasn't gnu that changed ms
[13:36:45] <dan01> Well I mean I mean I don't get it it has the Equals method right?
[13:36:49] <ejjfunky> thanks to Satya who changed the whole culture at M$, i think
[13:36:52] <dan01> So what all Objects have Equals
[13:37:01] <JakeSays> ejjfunky: it was market forces
[13:37:18] <ejjfunky> either M$ embrace open or they'd be dinosaurs
[13:37:20] <JakeSays> dan01: the two equals methods are very different
[13:37:59] <dan01> JakeSays: Ah ok
[13:38:06] <dan01> JakeSays: Care to elaborate, please?
[13:38:07] <ejjfunky> anyway, i hated Java ever since Oracle bought it
[13:38:19] <dan01> ejjfunky: true story bro, true story
[13:38:28] <dan01> Fucking hate Java
[13:38:30] <ejjfunky> and, after C# 4, C# already beating Java
[13:38:32] <JakeSays> dan01: one is type safe, one isn't. the significance of that is important
[13:38:47] <JakeSays> ejjfunky: lol i hated java long before that
[13:39:14] <JakeSays> dan01: so my question is: why is it important
[13:39:31] <ejjfunky> yea, too bad java was a requisite. i didnt know java enough to hate it.
[13:39:46] <ejjfunky> but never done any production code with it. survived until now. that says something.
[13:40:05] <JakeSays> actually i didn't hate java. i just liked c# better
[13:41:06] <ejjfunky> yea, somehow, C# feels better even with the free visual studio
[13:41:10] <Tobbi_> I haven't said Good Morning peasants, yet.
[13:41:20] <dan01> JakeSays: I'm reading about it thanks bud
[13:41:23] <jmer> Tobbi_: that's because you're a degenerate
[13:41:28] <Tobbi_> :D indeed
[13:41:46] <Tobbi_> jmer: You know, we're automating MS Office by starting office and then running a shitload of macro code...
[13:41:53] <Tobbi_> For some reason, that's incredibly slow.
[13:41:55] <dan01> You what language I started flirting after C#?
[13:41:57] <dan01> Swift
[13:42:01] <jmer> ... no fucking wonder Tobbi_ xD
[13:42:22] <Tobbi_> Our customer depends on office, though.
[13:42:32] <Tobbi_> I have no fucking clue how to make that faster.
[13:42:33] <jmer> only because they are dumb fucks
[13:42:46] <Tobbi_> No, because public agency.
[13:42:50] <JakeSays> Tobbi_: use c# instead of macros
[13:43:04] <Tobbi_> JakeSays: You mean using Interop or EPPlus
[13:43:11] <jmer> but it's not uncommon for a business to have some arcane super business critical Excel file with a Macro written so obscurely you'd need to be chtulu to make sense of it
[13:43:19] <JakeSays> Tobbi_: the office interop apis, yes
[13:43:24] <ki9a> JakeSays: I should try this at some point; rust -> bc -> .net
[13:43:34] <jmer> The office interop APIs are terrible, but still way better than macroes xD
[13:43:35] <Tobbi_> JakeSays: Yeah, rewriting that is not trivial.
[13:43:36] <ki9a> my BC reader isn't complete yet though
[13:43:54] <biberu> Tobbi_: there's also DocumentFormat.OpenXml
[13:43:58] <JakeSays> ki9a: is there a bc->cil converter?
[13:44:07] <Tobbi_> But we won't get around rewriting the macro code, I assume, right?
[13:44:14] *** Bilge- is now known as Bilge
[13:44:20] <JakeSays> Tobbi_: well you didn't ask for easy, just fast
[13:44:24] <Tobbi_> rue
[13:44:26] <Tobbi_> true
[13:44:29] <jmer> Tobbi_: you can make addins for office as well... It's been a couple years ago but I think it exposes a different API than the interop ones
[13:44:30] <Tobbi_> No, we're actually considering it.
[13:44:54] <jmer> allthough iirc I had to use the interop APIs in the addin I made because the addin API couldn't do it all (or some such nonsense)
[13:45:00] <ki9a> JakeSays: no; I'd be writing it
[13:45:20] <Tobbi_> I guess EPPlus would be the way to go.
[13:45:30] <Tobbi_> We're already paying for some license for that.
[13:45:38] <JakeSays> ki9a: there's always the bones of llilc
[13:45:50] <jmer> isn't EPPLUS just for document generation?
[13:45:51] <ki9a> thats the wrong way around though
[13:45:58] <ki9a> I want llvm to cil; not cil to llvm
[13:46:10] <JakeSays> ki9a: ah right
[13:46:24] <Tobbi_> jmer: As opposed to?
[13:46:28] <ki9a> essentially I want to run cranelift inside .net
[13:46:29] <ki9a> :)
[13:46:53] <JakeSays> ki9a: lol you really want to de-rust cranelift, don't you
[13:47:02] <ki9a> nah
[13:47:08] <ki9a> but I want to use cranelift
[13:47:11] <ki9a> and contribute to it
[13:47:20] <jmer> Tobbi_: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins
[13:47:20] <ki9a> and having it as native element is a pain to debug/interact with
[13:47:33] <jmer> Tobbi_: EPPLUS is for automating stuff without user interaction, yes?
[13:47:43] <Tobbi_> jmer: Yes, exactly what we want.
[13:47:59] <jmer> Snice you mentioned macros I just assumed a user was involved
[13:48:05] <Tobbi_> Ah, no
[13:48:08] <JakeSays> ki9a: i imagine that a gc would make the rust ownership stuff easier to deal with
[13:48:14] <Tobbi_> We start macros using Interop :D
[13:48:20] <JakeSays> Tobbi_: LOL
[13:48:34] <Tobbi_> A shitload of technical debt.
[13:49:01] <JakeSays> Tobbi_: i'll write you a macro->c# converter
[13:49:10] <Tobbi_> JakeSays: uh?
[13:49:12] <jmer> it'll only cost you your soul
[13:49:18] <Tobbi_> Can that be done that easily?
[13:49:25] <ejjfunky> JakeSays: are you doing rust? sytanx, especially when you want to do input seems a little complicated to me
[13:50:07] <JakeSays> Tobbi_: i've written vb(pre-.net)->c# translators before
[13:50:17] <JakeSays> it wouldn't be all that difficult
[13:50:50] <ki9a> JakeSays: I would use regular memory management actually
[13:51:01] <ki9a> I've written a VB compiler actually
[13:51:03] <ki9a> or wel
[13:51:05] <ki9a> my colleague did
[13:51:06] <JakeSays> ejjfunky: i want to learn rust
[13:51:15] <Tobbi_> JakeSays: I am not sure if that helps us...I'd have to translate all the C# code to Excel interop / EPPlus
[13:51:27] <ejjfunky> JakeSays: cool. let us know how it goes. :D
[13:51:35] <JakeSays> Tobbi_: no, the interop converion is part of it
[13:51:43] <Tobbi_> Interesting.
[13:51:44] <JakeSays> *conversion
[13:51:52] <Tobbi_> And it's *that* easy?
[13:51:52] <ki9a> I do like rust as a language
[13:52:02] <Inge> so is Blazor the best thing since DCOM/CORBA, or is it the new Silverlight(tm) ?
[13:52:05] <Tobbi_>  / straightforward?
[13:52:23] <JakeSays> Tobbi_: well, it's easy if you understand both languages well and know how to write compilers/translators
[13:52:41] <ki9a> vb has some semantics that aren't easily translatable though
[13:52:49] <JakeSays> Inge: not to me
[13:52:50] <ki9a> on error continue for example
[13:53:15] <jmer> "on error continue" is the strategy I use for walking home drunk
[13:53:19] <JakeSays> ki9a: well, they aren't easily translated in an elegant way

[13:57:53] <Tobbi_> :D
[13:57:57] <Tobbi_> I do that already
[13:59:35] <ejjfunky> but you can go further. eat them until you get tired of them that you won't want to eat them until a month. then you'll lose weight.
[13:59:59] <ki9a> JakeSays: Feel like writing a rust demangler?
[14:01:52] <ki9a> my BC reader works now.
[14:08:17] <Tobbi_> ejjfunky: It takes a while for me to get tired of pastries.
[14:09:18] <ejjfunky> Tobbi_: go to an all you can eat buffet and spend a day there.
[14:09:24] <Tobbi_> :D
[14:09:27] <Tobbi_> Challenge accepted.
[14:09:52] <ejjfunky> Tobbi_: I hope it works. It worked for me.
[14:10:12] <Tobbi_> I'll see...
[14:10:14] <JakeSays> ki9a: after i learn rust
[14:10:31] <JakeSays> although writing a demangler would help learn rust
[14:10:53] <ki9a> yeah!
[14:11:13] <ejjfunky> Tobbi_: I was 220 pounds (about 100 KG). Now I weight 155 (about 70 KG)
[14:11:23] <Tobbi_> nice :)
[14:11:27] <Tobbi_> I'm 100 kg as well..
[14:11:29] <Tobbi_> round about
[14:11:44] <ejjfunky> yea, used that strategy where i killed my appetite by overdosing first.
[14:11:48] <JakeSays> i'd love to be around 100kg
[14:12:01] <Tobbi_> I haven't actually weighed myself in quite a long time.
[14:12:06] <ki9a> you could go like the english
[14:12:11] <ki9a> they count weights in rocks
[14:12:30] <JakeSays> lol
[14:13:48] <ejjfunky> Tobbi_: if it's too hard. try shorter goal first. Once a week. And then Twice a week. When you get to a month, it'll be easier then.
[14:14:04] <Tobbi_> once a week what?
[14:14:07] <ejjfunky> Once a week going to the buffet, i mean.
[14:14:12] <Tobbi_> Ah.
[14:14:22] <Tobbi_> I'd rather try restricting what I eat
[14:14:33] <ejjfunky> just stuffing your face. but i think a few times like that and you'll get sick of it. at least thats what happened to me.
[14:14:33] <JakeSays> Tobbi_: just remember that you'll then need to lose the 50kg you put on from breaking the habit
[14:14:43] <Tobbi_> Yes, exactly.
[14:15:31] <teegee> or you could just carry rocks around with you, that'll make you lose some :>
[14:15:55] <ejjfunky> anyway, i took me about 2-3 years to get down to this weight. and there were failures along the way.
[14:16:02] <ejjfunky> so just have fun with it. but just dont give up
[14:16:49] <JakeSays> one way to motivate yourself is to start dating someone 20 years younger
[14:17:22] <ejjfunky> JakeSays: hehehe
[14:17:31] <teegee> JakeSays: that might be a chicken'n'egg problem
[14:17:56] <JakeSays> teegee: you would think
[14:18:29] <teegee> unless it's a one-way affair with your personal trainer
[14:19:27] <ejjfunky> problem with dating someone that young is metabolism. he/she will eat the same amount or more food and doesn't gain the weight as you do

[14:49:39] <JakeSays> a few years ago i had an idea for a diet pill that would work well, but i'm not sure how to make it
[14:52:04] <Tobbi_> does it involve anti-matter?
[14:52:15] <JakeSays> LOL no
[14:52:26] <JakeSays> there's always the diet patch
[14:52:36] <JakeSays> you wear it over your mouth. lol
[14:54:40] <Tobbi_> git apply diet.patch
[14:54:43] <JakeSays> Tobbi_: the concept is pretty simple. the pill is made out of a substance that expands to the size of a golf ball in the presence of stomach acid, and then takes a couple of hours to dissolve.
[14:54:55] <Tobbi_> hehe, sounds interesting
[14:55:03] <JakeSays> it's sort of like a lap band in a pill
[14:55:19] <Tobbi_> nice
[14:55:30] <JakeSays> i just don't know what to make it out of
[14:55:42] <JakeSays> it would be good if the substance doesn't kill ya. lol

[14:56:03] <JakeSays> get high w/o the munchies
[14:56:17] <Tobbi_> :D
[14:59:01] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Just start with what you know. A chip that detects the substance and a microcontroller to inflate stuff.
[14:59:15] <MatthiasVance> Then scale down xD
[14:59:28] <JakeSays> LOL
[15:00:16] <MatthiasVance> It's even easier if you could just buy a large balloon and ingest it
[15:00:20] <MatthiasVance> Then the tech can be on the outside
[15:01:15] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: well, the idea is there's no tech
[15:01:50] <MatthiasVance> Should you still feel good after taking the pill?
[15:02:13] <JakeSays> yes, just full
[15:02:14] <MatthiasVance> Or can it have nausea as side effect (and therefore get rid of wanting to eat)
[15:02:16] <MatthiasVance> oh, shit
[15:02:20] <JakeSays> LOL
[15:02:50] <MatthiasVance> "Take 100 of these pills and you will feel full without taking any food
[15:02:55] <MatthiasVance> Another options
[15:02:58] <MatthiasVance> *option
[15:03:40] <MatthiasVance> But regarding your balloon pill idea, all you would have to do is find something that is digestible, but not fast enough as the rest of the pill, and also something to expand it
[15:03:58] <JakeSays> LOL yeah that's all that has to be done
[15:05:17] <ejjfunky> one healthy food that does that is oatmeal. it tends to make you fuller

[15:26:13] <jmer> the weight problems started when I could afford a car, steaks and 3 meals a day
[15:26:19] <MatthiasVance> Neither did I but that had more to do with metabolism than money
[15:26:33] <MatthiasVance> jmer: I thought they had good student thingies in Denmark?
[15:27:24] <jmer> MatthiasVance: WHen I studied I gout about 1000€ pr. month as a government scholarship
[15:27:28] <jmer> then I had to work besides that
[15:27:39] <jmer> and I had to pay rent, bills, food, books for education...

[15:28:36] <jmer> so yeah, you can get some money but that doesn't  mean you live in luxury, in contrary it will get you a small apartment (usually apartments specifically fors tudents) and the basic (food ,but nothing fancy)
[15:31:07] <MatthiasVance> EUR 1000 per month is a ton lol
[15:31:24] <jmer> well ok
[15:31:40] <MatthiasVance> Then again I didn't opt for student housing but rather .. anti-squatters or something
[15:31:43] <jmer> part of that is because I choose to also take a student loan
[15:31:50] <MatthiasVance> So nice houses that they just needed people in
[15:31:59] <MatthiasVance> Which was 80? or maybe 180 / month
[15:32:21] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Ah yes I did the same, they said in school "better max out your loans instead of having to working and fucking up your study"
[15:32:22] <jmer>  I lived in a cheap city
[15:32:32] <jmer> Well I had to take student loans AND work
[15:32:39] <MatthiasVance> Which resulted in me loaning money and fucking up my study because there was no incentive
[15:32:56] <jmer> and then I had to loan extra money in the bank to cover shitty decisions or unforseen expenses
[15:33:08] <MatthiasVance> ohh
[15:33:14] <MatthiasVance> How much was your total at the end?
[15:33:19] <MatthiasVance> I think we are both at EUR 50k
[15:33:49] <jmer> total what? debt?
[15:33:52] <MatthiasVance> yes
[15:34:15] <jmer> about 40k €
[15:34:44] <jmer> some of this debt was actually my ex girlfriend's
[15:34:46] <jmer> but she was "smart"
[15:34:54] <jmer> she would piss away all her own moneyh the first week
[15:34:59] <jmer> and then rely on me paying for food, bills etc.
[15:35:04] <jmer> that I had to take loans to actually pay
[15:36:08] <MatthiasVance> Oh, wtf =/
[15:36:48] <jmer> yeah
[15:38:30] <jmer> anyways, my point is... The government prvoided scholarship is ofc. a giant luxury and I appreciate it, but it won't cover everything unless you are willing to live a place where you have 30-60 min. of travel time to school, only eat bread and the cheapest of food, have no social life...
[15:39:22] <jmer> you could argue that a social life is a luxury as a student, but studies have shown that the A graders have a harder time getting a job than the avg. student who spent time partying

[15:49:35] <ASUS> I might have a technical interview next week for a C# wfm job
[15:49:39] <ASUS> pretty excited
[15:49:57] <ASUS> I've been doing C# challenges
[15:49:59] <ASUS> wfh*
[15:50:08] <MatthiasVance> I googled WFM
[15:50:09] <MatthiasVance> :D
[15:50:14] <MatthiasVance> Nice, ASUS !
[15:50:18] <ejjfunky> wow, congrats, ASUS! I want a WFH too.
[15:50:24] <jmer> what is WFM?

[15:50:34] <jmer> nevermind

[15:51:31] <ASUS> I hope my potential company doesn't do that
[15:51:42] <MatthiasVance> Is it in the US?
[15:52:29] <ejjfunky> i was in a company like that. you just have to be careful not to use it for personal use because they actually will bring it up in your last days of work
[15:52:50] <ejjfunky> if they find something bad, they can actually cut you off for any compensation or even your last salary
[15:53:58] <ejjfunky> in some situation, you can get fired

[15:55:22] <ejjfunky> any of you guys here in security or infrastructure? i'm wondering how the company can actually force you to spy on its workers.
[15:56:54] <Kim^J> ejjfunky: They simply use remote management tools and install whatever they want
[15:57:11] <MatthiasVance> ejjfunky: No control over your own laptop is a first step :)
[15:57:14] <MatthiasVance> *device
[15:57:35] <ASUS> What's stopping them stealing passwords and cc nums
[15:57:38] <ejjfunky> yea, for me, the infra guy already set it up before passing the laptop to me
[15:58:38] <ejjfunky> also the funny thing is, i don't know if it's just the guy, but he wasn't that friendly to me. it's all business to him. didn't even want to make a light chat.
[15:58:39] <Kim^J> ASUS: Nothing
[15:59:00] <Kim^J> ejjfunky: How large is the company?
[15:59:23] <ejjfunky> pretty big. one of those international consulting companies

[16:00:21] <Kim^J> ejjfunky: So, most likely, that person has a shittonne of work to do, small talk just worsens the issue

[16:03:38] <ejjfunky> now, where's that wfh job ASUS was talking about.

[16:04:00] <ejjfunky> oh ok
[16:04:12] <ASUS> I haven't got it yet
[16:04:18] <ASUS> need to pass technical interview
[16:04:24] <ejjfunky> ahh, i hope you'll get it. all the best of luck
[16:04:42] <ASUS> thanks
[16:05:19] <jmer> are you a junior dev ASUS ?
[16:05:32] <ASUS> yeah
[16:05:33] <jmer> I don't think "technical interviews" makes much sense if you have a proven record of other jobs
[16:05:39] <ASUS> I mean
[16:05:40] <jmer> ah.. right.
[16:05:42] <ASUS> entry level
[16:06:30] <ejjfunky> it used to be for junior dev it's so much easier. nowadays, it's kinda crazy the hoops you need to jump into
[16:06:41] <ejjfunky> i think the bar is so much higher than like 5 or 10 years ago
[16:06:58] <jmer> Well.. they placed that bar in the entirely wrong area
[16:07:13] <jmer> all you get are people who knows how to game these systems, I don't think it shows much "skill"
[16:08:09] <xb0o2> Much easier to teach someone some algorithms and some syntax than it is to teach a decent mindset for a junior.
[16:08:14] <ASUS> you get engineers who are good at leetcode
[16:08:22] <ASUS> and who have never made their own project before

[17:32:04] <Nasp> So i ate at a pure american restaurant sunday and i tipped a bit
[17:32:08] <Nasp> They didn't notice or said thanks
[17:32:14] <khanred> lol
[17:32:19] <khanred> They never do - it's expected
[17:32:33] <Nasp> It's not expected here
[17:32:48] <ap5> khanred, in DK a warehouse job is 27+ usd
[17:33:04] <khanred> ap5, Isn't the tax rate also 60% on average?
[17:33:08] <khanred> so...
[17:33:10] <jmer> no
[17:33:20] <ap5> :D
[17:33:20] <jmer> the avg. tax rate is something in the 40s %

[17:34:57] <MatthiasVance> Right
[17:35:01] <Nasp> I did
[17:35:03] <Nasp> And they got pissed
[17:35:08] <MatthiasVance> ah
[17:35:13] <ap5> khanred, it is, when you hold it up against what you was going to pay for a hospital bed. Because we all pay a bit, we dont need to think about it when shit hits the fan
[17:35:15] <Nasp> Because it was only 15-18% and not 20%
[17:35:20] <MatthiasVance> oh wow okay
[17:35:24] <MatthiasVance> 10% is already generous here
[17:35:38] <Nasp> Over there they seem to go batshit crazy if you don't tip 20%
[17:35:47] <Nasp> Well Crazy New Yorkers
[17:35:50] <ap5> US has a sick work culture
[17:35:54] <MatthiasVance> Yeah
[17:35:58] <edcba> well it's a bit stupid to tip relatively to total bill
[17:36:21] <Nasp> I also hate the prices shown without vat
[17:36:31] <Nasp> So a 1 dollar coin offer is really 1.2 dollars
[17:36:36] <ap5> Are you in US now, Nasp?
[17:37:16] <Nasp> Nope
[17:38:26] <bomb> work culture? that's slavery ap5
[17:38:33] <ap5> xD
[17:38:44] <jmer> slavery like mployment happens in Denmark as well
[17:38:57] <ap5> It does
[17:39:02] <tsujp> dude when I go to america one day for a holiday
[17:39:02] <jmer> but it's usually targeted at foreigners... like there was a case with chinese chefs living in containers behind the restuarant
[17:39:04] <tsujp> im not gonna tip
[17:39:12] <tsujp> im not upkeeping that dogshit culture
[17:39:27] <khanred> Thanks for coming and underpaying our workers
[17:39:28] <jmer> If I go there I will visit Canada. Not the US
[17:39:28] <tsujp> not looking forward to it tbh cos they will think I am the asshole when really.. their bosses are
[17:39:42] <tsujp> khanred nah mate, get better laws that advocate minimum wage
[17:39:42] <Nasp> Yeah they blame the customer, it's so strange
[17:39:45] <edcba> is food industry resgning in US btw ?
[17:39:48] <tsujp> not my job to pay your workers salary lmfao

[17:40:03] <biberu> khanred: why aren't your wokers getting fair wages?
[17:40:07] <edcba> because here in france a lot of food ppl is going elsewhere
[17:40:20] <tsujp> no one else in the world tips, only NA
[17:40:38] <khanred> Unfortunately I can't snap my fingers and change the law, so I'm going to go ahead and make sure I'm doing something I can actually do to help. That being tipping...
[17:40:50] <biberu> you mean enabling?
[17:40:56] <edcba> well being alone doesn't make you wrong automatically but mandatory tipping is not tipping
[17:41:00] <tsujp> nope what you're actually doing is keeping it going instead of advocating for change
[17:41:00] <khanred> Enabling waiters to live, yes
[17:41:15] <tsujp> so you think if waiters earn no wage they will willingly work until they starve to death?
[17:41:19] <tsujp> instead of like.. finding a new job?
[17:41:27] <tsujp> then when no restaurants can hire waiters due to no tipping the law finally changes?
[17:41:48] <khanred> k

[17:43:03] <biberu> khanred: more like, don't eat at that palce?
[17:43:05] <tsujp> If the law stated you had to murder each waiter that served you, and it was legal, would you?
[17:43:16] <khanred> tsujp, Are you retarded?
[17:43:20] <edcba> the problem is alcoholics don't care because they didn't realize it :)
[17:43:22] <bomb> I always hit on waiter chicks. they always smile, which means they like it.
[17:43:45] <tsujp> Nope, but to move onto the next bit: so why are you drawing the line between that insane example I gave and tipping? Because tipping culture is also retarded
[17:43:53] <bomb> I don't use the term "waitress" because I find that sexist.
[17:43:54] <tsujp> where are you drawing the line*
[17:44:07] <jmer> I have tipped waiters/waitresses when I've felt they performed above and beyond normal service.
[17:44:15] <tsujp> ^
[17:44:17] <bomb> see? a sexist Dansk ^
[17:44:29] <jmer> How is that sexist bomb ?
[17:44:41] <khanred> I already established I don't favor the tipping culture
[17:44:49] <bomb> I never tip male waiters, because why would I lol
[17:44:51] <ap5> jmer, i have to
[17:44:56] <jmer> tsujp: but, if I visited the US (or any other country with a tipping culture) I would definately tip... Mostly because I try to behave when I am a guest.
[17:45:02] <jmer> When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
[17:45:03] <ap5> We nearly got sung out of the restaurant
[17:45:11] <tsujp> khanred you do because you perpetuate it
[17:45:21] <Nasp> jmer:  But many places it's not really a tip, but like 20% on top of the existing price
[17:45:21] <ap5> But then again, we tipped like 500 dkk :D
[17:45:31] <khanred> nope
[17:45:32] <Nasp> There's also those places with "gratuity charge"
[17:45:40] <Nasp> Of 10-20% and then they still expect a tip
[17:45:47] <bomb> there are places where they allow physically flirting with waitresses. I love those places.
[17:45:51] <jmer> Nasp: Sure but I'm a guest, I can't really change that. The citizens need to vote for people who are willing to improve worker conditions.
[17:45:56] <khanred> bomb, uh
[17:46:00] <tsujp> jmer there's a difference between behaving as a guest to normal cultural idiosyncrasies, like say in Japan where you put money in a tray and do not hand it to people etc and then there's tipping culture in the US which is wage slavery and NOT normal in any way shape or form
[17:46:01] <jmer> bomb: you're disgusting
[17:46:29] <Nasp> I also hate when people hand me the terminal to pay and it asks "Do you want to tip?"
[17:46:30] <jmer> tsujp: I understand your sentiment, but as a guest the only thing I will achieve by not tipping is making a waiter/waitress miserable.
[17:46:35] <Nasp> I saw Just-Eat also added tipping
[17:46:46] <Nasp> So after you pay 20 euro just for the delivery of a pizza
[17:46:50] <MatthiasVance> Yes I don't get that either
[17:46:57] <Nasp> Then you can also opt to tip 5-10-20%
[17:46:58] <jmer> tsujp: but I will never visit the US - because there are so many things in terms of how to run a society I don't agree with xD
[17:47:08] <tsujp> jmer maybe that will inspire the motivation for the necessary change because on the other side I am contributing to that
[17:47:40] <tsujp> i dont ever intend to visit but if I find myself there _for whatever reason_ I don't intend to support utterly asinine aspects of their society that make my blood boil just typing them on IRC

[18:10:37] <ASUS> also meat is a carcinogen
[18:10:47] <Tobbi_> I eat very little meat
[18:10:56] <edcba> by cutting sugar we mean stop drinking coca cola
[18:11:04] <ASUS> drink sugar free code
[18:11:06] <ASUS> coke
[18:11:06] <khanred> I think most people know how to eat healthy, but it's a psychological thing. An addiction.
[18:11:11] <jmer> They say you live longer if you don't smoke, date women and stay away from alcohol, but that's not true, it just feels like it.
[18:11:16] <edcba> syntax sugar free code :)
[18:11:19] <ap5> I to doesn't eat that much meat
[18:11:22] <Tobbi_> I'm always very nervous.

[18:11:42] <ASUS> I like VS2022 it has AI completion

[18:13:28] <khanred> Buuuuuuuuuuuut
[18:13:29] <edcba> yeah intellisense completion is ok so far for me
[18:13:36] <ASUS> It helps you avoid fencepost errors
[18:13:44] <khanred> Shouldn't these common code patterns just be abstracted into library functions?
[18:14:06] <ASUS> maybe, but it has to be written once
[18:14:23] <ASUS> and AI can help the initial class being created

[18:18:42] <ASUS> why did they train it on open sores software
[18:18:55] <khanred> Because they're github
[18:19:13] <ASUS> train it on production code from a large company
[18:19:22] <edcba> lol
[18:19:28] <ASUS> would it be better?

[19:08:18] <jmer> ASUS: I would have to look up the algorithm for that... because who memorizes stuff like that? xD
[19:08:18] <edcba> list.reverse()
[19:08:21] <edcba> next q
[19:08:26] <jmer> edcba: exactly
[19:08:43] <bomb> CS olympics, but the first step is always a recruiter who has no clue about computers lol.
[19:08:53] <edcba> well list reversion doesn't really need some fancy alg
[19:08:58] <ASUS> no only with being able to print the value of a node and get the next node
[19:09:09] <ASUS> it's easy with recursion
[19:09:17] <edcba> are they still coding in php btw ?
[19:09:45] <edcba> well they will tell you to not abuse the stack
[19:09:57] <edcba> nobody likes stack overflows
[19:10:05] <khanred> edcba, They have some custom PHP like language that compiles down to bytecode for their own VM, but a lot of services are written in C++ and shit
[19:10:23] <edcba> C++ and php understood
[19:10:46] <khanred> It's what Suckerturd knew so 16 years later they still use it I guess
[19:10:52] <irwiss> it's easy without recursion too, recursion will just eat up O(N) memory

[20:10:39] <hseg> so basically, I have my hierarchy PensionAsset : UserAsset : IAllocated which uses Account directly throughout
[20:10:52] <hseg> I want to be able to replace the uses of Account with MockAccount
[20:11:10] <hseg> so I add a generic type T in IAllocated
[20:11:46] <hseg> however, I want to still have my virtual UserAsset.Validate for the case T=Account
[20:12:44] <lara99> Hi, between 8000+ files I have to discover a connection to MySQL that remains opened (sleeping) and that consumes all the server resources until the app pool crashes... how can I do that?
[20:13:42] <hseg> hrm... I *could* extract another interface IAllocable with a method Validate, make Account and MockAccount both implement that, and implement the virtual Validate via that...
[20:13:56] <biberu> hseg: can you constrain the type parameter to Account? and that doesn't sound like something that should need to be mocked?
[20:14:29] <hseg> db-backed, we're transitioning schemas
[20:14:51] <hseg> "mock" is perhaps the wrong term
[20:15:18] <biberu> hseg: i'd typically think of something called Account as dumb data, but that probably doesn't help you
[20:15:39] <hseg> I wish it were that dumb

[20:16:19] <hseg> yeah, that looks like the best solution for now
[20:16:41] <hseg> and stub Validate() for MockAccount until I have proper validation logic for it
[20:17:04] <biberu> why would validate need to do anything different?
[20:17:24] <hseg> subclasses of UserAsset have extra validation logic
[20:18:05] <hseg> (btw, account here as in accountancy, not as in login)
[20:18:06] <JakeSays> hseg: you shouldn't be mocking a base class
[20:18:19] <biberu> you might be able to use drop the generics and use only an interface for it too
[20:18:30] <JakeSays> hseg: you need more composition
[20:18:38] <hseg> biberu: oh?
[20:18:40] <irwiss> imo you're trying to use inheritance for what's much better done with composition, if your account is a component this trivializes everything

[20:19:34] <DrowningElysium> Found my issue, I had Node 17 and Angular 13 installed first which are both bugged for some reason. So I downgraded them, and deleted the generated project. But there was still an entry in the solution file for the project name, which it errored on.
[20:20:24] <biberu> hseg: it shouldn't matter if subclasses have extra logic, they work on an account, you pass in an account
[20:20:52] <JakeSays> DrowningElysium: just edit the solution file
[20:20:56] <DrowningElysium> I did :)
[20:20:56] <hseg> probably am miscommunicating then
[20:21:01] <biberu> hseg: if they have to make exceptions for runtime types something is off, if they have to make exceptions for code that only exists in tests something is definitely wrong

[20:35:44] <hseg> UserAsst.Validate is dependent on OldAccount-specific logic

[20:36:24] <hseg> yup
[20:36:37] <biberu> what is that? can you e.g. move it to an interface?
[20:36:39] <hseg> and just discovered it also uses stuff from UserAsset
[20:38:20] <hseg> hrm. structure seems to be try { Validate(OldAccount); } catch { Log(UserAsset); }
[20:39:00] <hseg> less entangled than it seemed
[20:39:33] <hseg> ok, so just pull that out as a static interface method, have {Old,New}Account implement it, and call it
[20:40:27] <hseg> what was it that you said earlier about possibly not needing generics?
[20:41:26] <biberu> maybe it's enough with an interface for the account? i'm just guessing about your context though
[20:41:42] *** Quits: Babbage (~Babbage@94.11.27.96) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:42:43] <hseg> hrm. and generalize to accepting/returning members of that interface in UserAsset? might work, lemme check
[20:44:15] <hseg> nope -- the implementations for GetAllocations specifically return some concrete type
[20:44:38] <hseg> hrm. that's going to be a problem of its own
[20:45:21] <hseg> will need to have differing implementations for PensionAsset<OldAccount>.GetAllocations() and PensionAsset<NewAccount>.GetAllocations()
[20:45:25] * hseg sighs
[20:45:59] <hseg> because ofc we had to have mvc in name only
[20:47:05] <hseg> so now we're in a situation where GetAllocations needs to case-branch on two types
[20:47:16] <hseg> is this doable?
[20:47:18] <biberu> that part might be solvable with an interface as the basis for a constraint, as above
[20:47:35] <hseg> oh?
[20:47:36] <biberu> there's so many ways to model things
[20:47:48] <hseg> heh. ain't that the fact
[20:48:38] <hseg> the various implementations for GetAllocations have some validation logic, then call the appropriate datalayer function
[20:49:32] <biberu> inject a validator for T?
[20:50:24] <hseg> and the datalayer function?
[20:50:49] <biberu> why not?
[20:50:52] <hseg> the choice of datalayer function is a product of Old/NewAccount and the specific UserAsset subclass
[20:50:52] *** dostoyev1ky2 is now known as dostoyevsky2
[20:52:45] <hseg> you mean by dependency injection? but that means I'll need to explicitly set the functions at construction

[22:09:44] <Nasp> yes

[22:10:02] <Nasp> And here i am "How about you just remove the tracking scripts then"

[22:14:10] <jonp> yeah
[22:14:20] <biberu> jonp: i don't think there's any requirement for that, at least here functional cookies (for e.g. sessions) were exempt, and tracking should be opt in as far as i understand it
[22:14:35] <jonp> but that "tracking" should have been limited to *just* the site providing the cookies since browsers shut down cross-site-scripting vulns

[23:09:33] <viaSanctus> there are gangs that share 10% of their loot
[23:09:58] <viaSanctus> who better to have on the inside than a senior accountant?
[23:10:13] <Nasp> bomb:  That's quite a fun idea
[23:10:18] <viaSanctus> another company i know used the matter to "extract" money tax-free
[23:10:19] <Nasp> Although i dont like the tunes he's put on it
[23:11:02] <viaSanctus> with crypto you can do anything you want which in the past would raise red flags
[23:11:18] <viaSanctus> but hey...everything in name of "free" economics right? ;)

[23:31:05] <khanred> the both
[23:31:26] <khanred> I prefer being paralyzed by overanalyzing the situation
[23:31:31] <bomb> redhead or blonde? that's a beautiful love triangle right there!
[23:31:44] <khanred> the correct answer is always blonde

[23:47:16] <MatthiasVance> Lots of coucher
[23:48:11] <_genuser_> khanred going in for c# and doing php, you know what that means?
[23:48:35] <_genuser_> if you were in an anime, somewhere some old php master would be telling you about your destiny....
[23:48:54] <_genuser_> of course all the hot women would be in c#. and you'd be stuck in php with fat guys
[23:48:58] <khanred> hmm
[23:49:03] <khanred> Anime is weird
[23:49:11] <_genuser_> can't believe you said that.
[23:49:15] <_genuser_> YOU're weird!
[23:49:38] <khanred> Studio Ghibli content is the only anime I watch
[23:49:56] <_genuser_> they're supposed to be the top of genre though.
[23:50:01] <_genuser_> so probably lot of people watch that.
[23:50:51] <MatthiasVance> Just like C# is top of genre?

[23:53:19] <MatthiasVance> Hm I was planning to install Home Assistant on this Pi I will use for 3D printing.. however it wants ffmpeg as a dependency

[23:53:41] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: what's wrong with ffmpeg as a dep?
[23:53:53] <bomb> why not? do you hate BtbN
[23:54:08] <MatthiasVance> 1) I don't need it 2) I'm assuming it will be resource intensive :D
[23:54:11] <bomb> he's the creator and sole maintainer of ffmpeg project
[23:54:17] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: also, i wouldn't share the pi
[23:54:36] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: It's not going to use >60% of the CPU is it? :o
[23:54:39] <MatthiasVance> (octoprint)
[23:55:04] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: 80% through that 16 hour print and something else tanks the pi...
[23:55:21] <MatthiasVance> Because you turned on the light :')
[23:55:37] <MatthiasVance> Okay, yes, good point. However 50 EUR for just a printer driver is a bit nuts isn't it
[23:55:49] <JakeSays> not at all
[23:55:56] <JakeSays> NOT even close
[23:56:05] <JakeSays> dude.. it's nothing

[23:56:34] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: But now I need another Pi!
[23:56:39] <JakeSays> yup
[23:56:45] <MatthiasVance> I can't buy any
[23:56:57] <JakeSays> consider the pi the second half of the printer's controller
[23:57:24] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: what do you mean, you can't buy any
[23:57:25] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: How much CPU does your rbpi use during printing?
[23:57:38] <Nasp> I've never really checked
[23:57:39] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Everything is out of stock in the entire country
[23:57:48] <Nasp> And yeah stock is an isssue
[23:57:49] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Except for the 2GB RAM version.. of which I could buy .. 1
[23:57:53] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: it's not an issue of resource utilization. it's an issue of your sanity
[23:57:55] <bomb> in the near future, realistic AI sex dolls will be powered by RPi lol
[23:57:57] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Are you talking stepper drivers for 50 euro?
[23:58:02] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: No, rbpi
[23:58:04] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: 2gb is plenty for the printer
[23:58:05] <Nasp> ahh
[23:58:09] <Nasp> Yeah it's plenty
[23:58:17] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: I know, that's why I have it already running OctoPrint as of today
[23:58:27] <Nasp> Run it off and old phone :D
[23:58:31] <JakeSays> then quit bitchin' and buy another one, dammit
[23:58:33] <ASUS> I've been practicing leetcode with C#.
[23:58:40] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: I can't? They won't let me :D
[23:58:44] <ASUS> Turns out you can do a lot of functional programming in C#.
[23:58:48] <bomb> 2gb is barely enough for pre-computed jiggly boobs physics simulation data
[23:58:50] <ASUS> using Linq
[23:58:53] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: *sigh* such an amateur
[23:59:02] <bomb> go for 8gb for Samantha Fox
[23:59:11] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Okay technically I guess I could buy it with a new account on another address and name ;p
[23:59:22] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: exactly. sheesh.
[23:59:35] <MatthiasVance> But fuck it, I'll run it together first.
