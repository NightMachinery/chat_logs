[01:17:21] <ede> i never was able to run youtube livestreams with mpv. no idea why, i gave up at some point. i think it played the segments available in the m3u8 and then didn't re-request it.
[01:17:50] <ede> but now i have an issue i noticed before i think, not sure if related.
[01:18:01] <ede> if someone has access to german tv: https://www.ardmediathek.de/video/tatort-schimanski-oder-restauriert-in-hd/freunde-1986/wdr/Y3JpZDovL3dkci5kZS9CZWl0cmFnLWMyNDE1OTU2LTNhYzAtNDE2OC1hZjI5LTY3NDU0NTFiMTlhYg/
[01:18:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For livestreams I was able to until my latency to youtube suddenly started being too awful.
[01:18:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Now I watch & download VODs instead.
[01:18:34] <ede> dlp -F gives me a 404, while dl -F lists the formats, also gives me the .mp4 address.
[01:19:19] <ede> seen -dlp fail before on youtube, sometimes some formats just don't have a size value in the table, and then i can't get that format. -dl does.
[01:20:32] <ede> i'll still have to check with guaranteed uptodate versions and -V, but if someone could confirm this...
[01:24:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Debug logs are useless in my case.
[01:24:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It literally doesn't add any info on the error I get.

[01:28:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Weird. I added a print statement to the retry logic. It never got printed.
[01:28:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It never retries.

[01:29:25] <ede> yeah, i wish there was more actual yt* info than python :|
[01:31:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Even just something like log.debug(f"Retry {idx} of max {retries}") would be helpful
[01:32:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And of course the dev on Github didn't like having an issue that mentioned their verbosity makes no different for the log posted.
[01:32:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> -_-
[01:32:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you don't want that to be the case, properly log. You'd think it'd be obvious but...
[01:49:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> dl_fragment has no retry logic.
[01:49:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And while it's within the catch loop, it gets short-circuited to returning on error.
[01:56:10] <ede> before i used ytdl i hacked a script to at least replace the video recorder (kind of heh)
[01:56:25] <ede> changed it all the time because something broke all the time
[01:56:43] <ede> one of these things being unreliable sources
[01:56:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah, youtube kinda sucks.
[01:57:04] <ede> not only yt, even tv streams
[01:57:42] <ede> one of the best things was when i discovered curl's [from-to] operator. but it only works with a single changing part :/
[01:58:01] <ede> looping with a downloader isn't really a good idea heh
[01:58:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ...it's really looking like killing the short-circuit logic fixed my problem. That means the logic is faulty.

[13:05:06] <Intelo> hi
[13:05:13] <Intelo> JackFrost in yt-dlp or youtube-dl how can I download/ use timestamps and video partitions that the youtuber had already done to categorize the video parts?
[13:07:51] <JackFrost> Does --embed-chapters do what you want?
[13:09:59] <Intelo> JackFrost checking
[13:17:22] <Intelo> JackFrost fantastic. I didn't knew it was possible. Is that the best way though?
[13:17:30] <Intelo> JackFrost or other ways as well?
[13:28:48] <ede> weird, is this brandnew? can't even find it in the manpages.
[13:29:19] <ede> Intelo: is this those short lines in the timeline?
[13:35:31] <Intelo> ede yes
[13:35:39] <JackFrost> ede: It's in the manpage for me.
[13:35:55] <ede> i didn't unpack the newest download yet
[13:36:31] <JackFrost> I'm on 2021.12.01, but it shouldn't be *that* new.
[13:37:12] <ede> 10.22, so yeah
[13:38:21] <ede> no idea how it is implemented anyway. afaik MP4 doesn't even know about such things?
[13:39:10] <ede> i think i've only see this so far while playing some yt video with mpv, no idea where they hide it.
[13:39:36] <ede> maybe in the description, there's tracklists and such sometimes, and some mpv script interpreted it
[13:42:35] <Intelo> JackFrost ede is there a way to download the video and other meta files in a directory automatically
[13:42:42] <Intelo> and name the directory as name of video file
[13:43:13] <ede> Intelo, i built a script and some commands for some interactivity step by step with everything i needed
[13:43:55] <ede> but i still have no idea how to get the uploader name with youtube-dl, yt-dlp has a new option for such things
[13:44:08] <ede> w/ youtube-dl it prints the name and starts the download
[13:44:47] <JackFrost> ede: It's non-standard in mp4 technically, but all the better players support chapters.
[13:45:02] <ede> also better always use some id instead of weird titles, they could be everything
[13:45:14] * Intelo uses vlc and see chapters
[13:45:27] <ede> from a local mp4 file with nothing else in the directory?
[13:49:06] <Intelo> let me give an example. This video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgWm6sQwS_IÂ  has 'CC' sub titles but doing this don't show me . yt-dlp  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgWm6sQwS_I --write-subs --write-description --embed-chapters
[13:49:18] <Intelo> any clues?
[13:55:08] <ede> i only see auto english, so i guess some program on the server creates them
[13:56:57] <Intelo> ede I see. so that cannot be created/ downloaded? right JackFrost ?
[13:58:08] <ede> the people who wrote the MP4 standard should know. i think you can buy it from the ISO.
[13:58:54] <ede> well, no subs here. j shows no effect.
[14:46:18] <gnoo> Intelo: i get subtitles on that video
[14:46:20] <gnoo> en(vtt)
[14:47:14] <ede> look into the video settings, only a single sub, and it says auto
[14:47:20] <ede> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfJthDvcZ08 has 2 dozen
[14:47:23] <ede> just found it
[14:47:51] <ede> dl'd it, doesn't work locally, probably the file naming, have to check. but works directly in mpv.
[14:49:50] <gnoo> i get all the subtitles
[14:50:35] <gnoo> and it's not just over 2 dozen, it's much more
[14:51:39] <ede> which video?
[14:52:44] <gnoo> the one you posted
[14:52:58] <gnoo> but downloading gave only one sub so i'll try again
[14:53:12] <ede> even the menu on the website says 25
[14:53:54] <gnoo> ede: try this in a terminal and look at the output: mpv --no-config --ytdl-raw-options=write-sub=,write-auto-sub= 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfJthDvcZ08'
[14:54:11] <ede> no idea how to name them for mpv to find them, or if i'd need some playlist locally. its manpage is full of "subtitle" would take me half the day to read everything.
[14:54:17] <gnoo> 2727 subs
[14:55:42] <ede> [ffmpeg] tls: The TLS connection was non-properly terminated.
[14:55:42] <ede> [ffmpeg] tls: The TLS connection was non-properly terminated.
[14:55:45] <ede> a lot of it, yes
[14:55:58] <gnoo> or even yt-dlp --list-subs 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfJthDvcZ08'
[14:56:00] <ede> nah, i won't wait half an hour now
[14:58:28] <ede> Available automatic captions for qfJthDvcZ08: 109. Available subtitles for qfJthDvcZ08: 24
[14:58:38] <gnoo> Intelo: try this to download all subs: yt-dlp --write-subs --sub-langs all --write-auto-subs 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfJthDvcZ08'
[14:58:43] <ede> all of them in this format: su       vtt, ttml, srv3, srv2, srv1
[14:58:47] <ede> that's youtube-dl
[14:59:35] <ede> -dlp gives me 24 "Available subtitles for qfJthDvcZ08:" in this format: en       English             vtt, ttml, srv3, srv2, srv1, json3
[15:00:25] <ede> also 2725 "Available automatic captions for qfJthDvcZ08:" in this format: fa-sq         Persian from Albanian                          vtt, ttml, srv3, srv2, srv1, json3
[15:00:43] <gnoo> yup, 2725
[15:00:49] <gnoo> or somewhere near
[15:00:59] <gnoo> so use --sub-lang all 
[15:01:02] <gnoo> bbl
[15:01:48] <ede> the menu has OFF, 24 languages, English (auto). so that's why 25.
[15:02:19] <ede> what is 'X from Y' even supposed to mean?
[15:04:05] <ede> then the Android API has a different list than the Desktop API or w/e it is
[15:04:26] <ede> but the list there doesn't make sense at all
[15:05:22] <ede> also i have (mentioned it already) sometimes formats listed in yt-dlp with no filesize for the video. doesn't happen in youtube-dl.
[15:05:38] <ede> i can dl the format with youtube-dl, but not yt-dlp.
[15:06:08] <ede> both issues together now leave me back with the impression that their Android API is just broken.
[15:09:24] <ede> from albanian: 109. from arabic: 109. from bangla: 109. from chinese (hk): 109. from english: 109. LANGUAGES: 109. from french: 109.
[15:09:26] <ede> and so on
[15:10:44] <ede> sounds like they'd have 109 languages in total and able to create all of them from 25 languages
[15:10:55] <ede> 2725/109=25
[15:12:11] <ede> 25 translations (24+auto-english, see above) and from each they create one of 109, including French, English, French from English, English from French.
[15:12:50] <ede> sheesh, even French from French and English from English
[15:13:10] <ede> looks like yt-dlp doesn't list AVAILABLE translation but all POTENTIALLY ones
[15:14:23] <ede> which fits the youtube-dl list: 109 for auto captions, 24 (not included: auto-english) for available subs.
[15:14:49] <ede> and yes, i downloaded 24 REAL subs.
[15:22:50] <ede> there's "automatic_captions" in the jq'd JSON at 1146, 6*5+1=31 lines per language, ends in 89116. doesn't come out as an integer, but i won't check the whole list now..
[15:24:53] <ede> i can't even select them in the GUI, maybe it's just meant for people using a language with no available translation so they can select the source language for the task.
[15:36:43] <ede> ok, i found 2749 entries instead nof 2725. e.g. for "ar" there's 2 entries.
