[04:57:53] <perlbot> simcop2387: HELLO WORLD 
[04:57:53] <Grinnz> stringification of !!0 should be '0', but yeah changing that is questionable
[04:57:57] <xenu> yeah that's what i meant, waaaay too much code relies on the current bool behaviour
[04:58:20] <simcop2387> xenu: ah i thought you mean specifically for the true/false bits that were added
[04:58:51] <simcop2387> i hope those have magic set on them so the json modules and other serialization libraries can use them
[04:59:05] <xenu> of course you could make 'true' return a special boolean object, but that wouldn't be very useful because boolean expressions would be still returning the old bools
[04:59:18] <simcop2387> looks like they should have that, https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/19040

[04:59:40] <simcop2387> xenu: LeoNerd thought of that already
[05:02:15] <xenu> i wonder if cpanel::json::xs will handle those new bools, with reini you never know
[05:02:57] <simcop2387> hard to say, we might need CPanel::JSON::XS::ButMaintained
[05:03:50] <jdv> fun
[05:05:41] <xenu> it seems 5.36 will be one of the bigger releases in a while: bools, multiple value for(), defer, builtin::
[05:06:04] <simcop2387> i want to say there's another too, let me look again

[05:07:14] <Grinnz> i doubt reini would reject a PR using them
[05:07:47] <xenu> it seems like one of those things that he may consider a misfeature
[05:08:00] <Grinnz> probably needs to happen only with unblessed_bool enabled
[05:08:17] <Grinnz> actually, i think that would already work
[05:08:41] <simcop2387> doesn't look like there's a nicely updated set of perldeltas yet
[05:08:47] <xenu> i mean it there *is* some merit to the complaints that bools aren't compatible with perl's typeless spirit
[05:08:57] <xenu> davem was one of the opponents of this change
[05:09:48] <jdv> yaml's bools are the best ive seen by far
[05:10:01] <Grinnz> the problem is encoding !!1 would put 1 in the json before, and if you change that to put true in that can break stuff
[05:10:13] <Grinnz> unless you requested unblessed_bool
[05:10:35] <Grinnz> things would be easier if existing programs didn't exist
[05:10:43] <simcop2387> hrm, i must be nuts or it isn't merged yet
[05:10:51] <xenu> otoh thanks to the uselessness of !!0 stringification many people probably changed their code not to pass it to the encoder
[05:11:08] <Grinnz> yeah, !!1 is far more likely to be used accidentalyl that way
[05:11:27] <xenu> hmm unless !!0 is treated as a number
[05:11:28] <xenu> let's check
[05:11:35] <Grinnz> no idea tbh

[08:04:11] <Kaedenn> I have a $PATH-like colon-delimited string that I want to remove duplicates and empty entries from.

[08:12:21] <Grinnz> oh, you want the opposite
[08:12:25] <Kaedenn> but... I want those removed
[08:12:26] <Kaedenn> yes
[08:12:42] <Grinnz> oh, because there's a trailing newline
[08:12:52] <Grinnz> so the last field isn't stripped
[08:12:58] <Grinnz> perl -le
[08:13:10] <Grinnz> er
[08:13:28] <Grinnz> you're not using -n, so... chomp and re-add the newline as needed yourself
[08:14:09] <Grinnz> you probably would be better off using -p for this though
[08:14:32] <Kaedenn> it's been many (not really) years since I last dove into perl

[08:16:17] <Grinnz> yes, because that's not how -p works

[08:16:24] <Kaedenn> oh!
[08:16:39] <Kaedenn> I missed that, whoops, ok
[08:17:07] <Kaedenn> I like this, thank you
[08:17:32] <Kaedenn> it's less intuitive though
[08:18:08] <Kaedenn> (for the next maintainer as someone who doesn't know perl, which is entirely possible)
[08:18:18] <Kaedenn> however, I'll comment it
[08:18:53] <Kaedenn> haha, this is *one* character shorter than my original perl command and removes my sed command entirely
[08:18:58] <Grinnz> -p doesn't really buy you a lot, except for working if multiple lines got passed to it which your original code didn't
[08:20:19] <Grinnz> though "working" is questionable and i would probably pass -0777 to it anyway to make sure it gets it all in one line

[08:34:56] <gordonfish> What's interesting is a lot of cheapo chinese hand and desk calculators (many of which have fake solar cells or real cells that are unwired) that show 1.999999998 for that calculation, seemingly misrounding in the other direction.

[08:35:25] <gordonfish> Ah, that
[08:35:32] <gordonfish> Ah, that's where JS gets it from
[08:36:07] <gordonfish> Although Perl is built from C, but appears to be better about it.
[08:38:02] <gordonfish> What I'm really curious is why C overrounds while cheap calculators underround for this computation. My guess is that it has something to do with two separate archs, x86(_64/AMD64) vs whatever those calcs use.
[08:48:33] <gordonfish> (those cheap calculators all appear to use a single chip, probably all the same one, as they all display 1.999999998 (might be off by the number of 9s, but somewhere thereabouts, ending with an 8.))
[08:50:41] <rbraun> is their sqrt(2) rounded down more before you square it again?

[17:14:14] <xq> test suites run 100s/1000s of times, so if it's broken eventually the test will fail
[17:14:22] <brunoramoslu> I did not think about mocking the random number generator...
[17:16:21] <brunoramoslu> I have the weird felling that trust on the number of iteration to validate could be problematic when analyzing the unit test itself, you could have random fails :/ I understand the practicality of it, but was wondering what the theoretically recommended way would be
[17:17:02] <brunoramoslu> I'm just calling rand() at the moment, so I could setup the class to accept the random generator and overwrite it in the test
[17:17:51] <brunoramoslu> I'm already doing that for the configuration file anyway, i have a configuration file in t/data/config to make sure the conditions for the test do not change if the main config file is updated
[17:19:33] <brunoramoslu> This is how the test is looking at the moment: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/d3ff6cc9/

[22:47:49] <LeoNerd> simcop2387: So... Tricky design thoughts. This eCO2 sensor being a fake one, it estimates CO2 by a bunch of methods, which can be improved in accuracy with knowledge of current temperature and humidity. There's a register to input that. I happen to have an HTU21D in the same box here, so... in theory that would be easy
[22:48:27] *** Joins: monkey_ (~user@190.104.116.153)
[22:48:40] <LeoNerd> Custom written logic in the program could query the temp/humid, then feed that into the eCO2 and get better results. But it's hard to imagine how that would work via something like the generic  device-chip-sensor-exporter  wrapper program
[22:49:06] <LeoNerd> The whole point really is that these are notionally independent sensors that just all generate results separately then all get reported at the end

[23:06:15] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: yea i'm trying to find those algorithms so i can take the raw sensor values and make a noisier, but more accurate estimate myself.  from the looks of what i can find with mine, my biggest issue is the rate of change of the temperature is too fast, it doesn't recalibrate the parameters often enough to do it for my use case because it'd be much more noisy to do that.  i'll take noisy and
[23:06:21] <simcop2387> run a low pass on it over invalid data
[23:07:10] <LeoNerd> I implemented mid3 filtering on App::Device::Chip::Sensor but I should add some more
[23:08:01] <LeoNerd> mid3 is nice because it discards all single outliers but otherwise tracks fast changes [retty quickly
[23:10:08] <simcop2387> yea not sure what level of filtering i'll need for it until i figure out how to try to calculate it myself, might need a simple one like that, might need a more complicated exponential decay thing or something
[23:11:09] <LeoNerd> Probably best to avoid any sort of IIR filter like exp decay
[23:11:34] <LeoNerd> I tried those and the problem is tuning them - it's hard to reject noise while still tracking fast
[23:11:51] <LeoNerd> mid3 or mid5 or... some others I don't know the names of are nicer
[23:12:24] <LeoNerd> E.g. I want to implement "average of the middle 3 of the last 5 readings", for variations on 3 and 5
[23:12:37] <LeoNerd> mid3 and mid5 are just those where it's an average of 1
[23:14:56] <simcop2387> i don't need to track too fast for this i don't think, but i'm not sure really yet
