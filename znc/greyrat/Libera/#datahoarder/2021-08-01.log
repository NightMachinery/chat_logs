[05:30:36] <ThePendulum> that should work, definitely fits more 3,5" disks than the 804. I don't remember what my requirements were at the time
[05:32:02] <ThePendulum> looks I could double my capacity with that case, think the HDD price is pretty bad now though, and I don't think they're still using HGST Ultrastars in the WD Elements externals 
[05:32:46] <DedSec> 18 drives you can hold with two cages in the bottom if needed
[05:33:02] <DedSec> so plenty of space and the front panel swings on a door :)
[05:33:52] <ThePendulum> nice, the 804 has 8 floating slots in a dedicated backside, 2 on the floor underneath the motherboard, and then 2x 2,5" behind the front panel. I'm using all but one 2,5" atm
[05:34:15] <DedSec> i think the define 7 has some as well
[05:34:19] <DedSec> 3 for ssd?
[05:34:21] <ThePendulum> I still have a HBA card to host 8 more disks
[05:34:33] <ThePendulum> just not the wallet ðŸ˜­
[05:34:37] <DedSec> yea i was thinking i need something
[05:35:04] <ThePendulum> this is the 804, pretty happy with the facilities Fractal offers, using them for my workstation now too https://m.imgur.com/a/71KVB9S
[05:35:31] <DedSec> holy shit
[05:36:30] <DedSec> That's small
[05:37:36] <ThePendulum> space efficiency was probably a factor, wasn't sure where it was going to end up, it's under the staircase now, I think a full tower would've fit there 
[05:37:46] <DedSec> But good cable management. I need some longer sata cables
[05:39:17] <ThePendulum> iirc I got two SAS to 4x SATA splitter cables from china, the storage card has sas outputs 
[05:39:20] <DedSec> I was wondering about the define 7 xl since the door isn't mesh and solid metal when closed so airflow would be junk but it has 3 intake fans in the front since the hdds attach in the back with trays.
[05:39:37] <ThePendulum> hmm no meshify variant with the same frame?

[05:40:16] <DedSec> I did see that one
[05:40:23] <DedSec> I was like eh
[05:40:50] <ThePendulum> the non XL is my workstation case
[05:41:09] <DedSec> Nice
[05:41:16] <DedSec> I have a lian li for my main pc
[05:41:44] <ThePendulum> what do you mean the hdds attach in the back btw? 
[05:41:57] <ThePendulum> as in how they slide in? 
[05:41:59] <DedSec> I meant on the side like the meshify does
[05:42:20] *** Joins: cosmicjoker_ (~cosmicjok@user/cosmic)
[05:42:27] <ThePendulum> ah right, thought you meant they were opposite the front panel in the case which didn't seem right heh, I was thinking about the cooling 
[05:42:40] <DedSec> Yea
[05:42:56] <DedSec> Iam curious does the Temps get hot as hell in your case
[05:43:40] <ThePendulum> it's usually around 35-30Â°C depending on which disk, pretty big differences between them
[05:43:56] <DedSec> Not bas

[05:45:25] <DedSec> i never used it
[05:45:53] <ThePendulum> it's alright, does everything I need when I want it to, wish it had a better "just browse the files" mode but that was a problem with plex as well 
[05:46:08] <DedSec> oh i see
[05:46:10] <ThePendulum> I have folders of home videos that it will try to organize in series and find posters for 
[05:46:19] <ThePendulum> my life isn't that epic
[05:46:23] <DedSec> thats intresting lol
[05:46:46] <DedSec> i wonder how good it does with rclone mounting for remote mounting from google drive

[05:48:38] <DedSec> 8tb
[05:49:25] <ThePendulum> hmm I think I paid 180eu for my 8tb externals because they were cheaper than the spare disks, so I guess those would've been around that price, but of course that was western digital
[05:49:40] <DedSec> ah
[05:49:48] <DedSec> i mean 224 isnt bad
[05:50:13] <DedSec> iam not going to have 18 drives right away but mabey like 10
[05:50:41] <DedSec> 80 TB is still damn good
[05:50:47] <ThePendulum> ah it was 165eu so I guess it does add up
[05:51:06] <ThePendulum> yeah, it's addictive though haha, not sure what you have now for
[05:51:46] <DedSec> i had a single WD my cloud nas and i shut that crap off
[05:51:54] <ThePendulum> what parity are you going for? my main pool is 6x 8TB + 2 parity drives for redundancy

[05:53:33] <DedSec> i might go with 5

[05:58:35] <ThePendulum> ah no, not yet, just filthy power from greedy lying energy companies
