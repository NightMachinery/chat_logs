[04:00:00] <greybot> Aliases suck. They don't work in scripts. They can't take arguments. They have special evil magical powers that break all expectations. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/080 for starters.
[04:00:12] <ormaaj> !learn chattr Use `chattr +a ~/.bash_history` to set the append-only flag on the history file. This guards against potential loss of history lines, but prevents all write operations other than append, requires both OS and filesystem support, usually requires privileges, and the commands for setting and querying the attribute are nonstandard and OS dependent. https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/088#Using_extended_attributes

[04:09:11] <ormaaj> The nice thing about aliases for trivial interactive wrappers is they aren't functions and go in their own namespace. Wrapping an interactive command in an alias (if you're careful) won't break other functions that use the same command and the alias is easily overridable by escaping it. Still you have to know what you're doing unfortunately of they'll trip you up.

[04:10:07] <earnestly> I still end up using aliases for trivial things like ls to include -lA for example
[04:10:43] <goodugly_> I mean, there is one thing I just realized, the fact that aliases *don't* work in scripts is good? If they did work then my personal aliases could break portable scripts
[04:11:26] <ormaaj> it's only really an advantage if you're sourcing files and want it to work both interactively and in scripts.
[04:12:55] <ormaaj> you have to do everything in the right order for that to work too. The aliases have to be defined after all of your function defs so that they don't affect the function definition itself.
[04:14:42] <ormaaj> Of course you need to know all that and more, and none of this is explained anywhere. it's easier to just say "don't use aliases"

[04:46:47] <ormaaj> it's like that with everything. you can copy-paste forever and kick the learning down the road for later. I do it all the time.
[04:48:42] <goodugly_> the issue is that I have problems with memory, i lost count of how many times i've read find(1) for instance, and i still do it, i never remember anything
[04:50:09] <goodugly_> i also read *most* of the bash guide
[04:51:00] *** Parts: mago (~mago@87.125.54.129) ()
[04:51:01] <goodugly_> but remember how to create some conditional properly? nah, never, then just google and hope it works, or read the manual for the 7th time
[04:51:44] <goodugly_> surely after this time i'll remember it for the future
[04:52:19] <goodugly_> maybe technology isn't for me
[04:52:22] <ormaaj> The conditional and the test commands are separate concepts. That's all you have to remember. 
[04:53:15] <goodugly_> i meant "conditional" as in logic of code flow, wether i use a bash conditional if or a test to control whether to continue executing
[04:53:24] <e36freak> right
[04:53:30] <e36freak> but 'if' and '[' are two separate things
[04:53:38] <e36freak> if accepts a command. '[' is a command
[04:53:57] <e36freak> if grep -q word file; then echo 'word is in file'; fi
[04:54:31] <goodugly_> should i even use if with [ or just go with [ test ] &&
[04:54:37] <e36freak> if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then command journalctl -f; else command journalctl -f -u "$@"; fi
[04:54:41] <ormaaj> I'm puzzled how you came up with `if $ -e 0`
[04:54:59] <e36freak> [ test ] && is perfectly fine too, but note that foo && bar || baz is not equivalent to if foo; then bar; else baz; fi
[04:55:04] <e36freak> if is cleaner, imo

[13:50:33] <pj> utis: look in /etc/profile.d
[13:51:02] <utis> pj: ah! i wasn't aware of that: thanks
[13:51:08] <ormaaj> or /etc/bash
[13:51:37] <ormaaj> there are some compile-time configurable startup locations. Depends on distro
[13:51:38] <utis> there's a file there called colorls.sh.  i suspect that has something to do with it
[13:51:49] <pj> utis: yep, that's the one.
[13:52:38] <pj> ormaaj: in my case it's not compile-time, those files are sourced from /etc/profile
[13:54:21] <ormaaj> I usually end up deleting a ton of that stuff and reimplementing it in .bashrc
[13:54:29] <pj> sure
[13:54:54] <pj> you just need to make sure that if you delete one of those files that your package manager doesn't replace it the next time you update.

[13:56:01] <ormaaj> yeah not a problem on gentoo, or most systems, depending how annoying the PM is about config management
[13:57:13] <pj> well, in RHEL (and other ELs) it's listed as a config file in RPM, so if the file exists it won't be replaced but if you delete it then the file will get restored, so the best way to deal with it is to replace it with a blank or nearly-blank file.
[13:57:42] <pj> likely in Fedora, and other siilar distros as well.
[13:57:44] <earnestly> A common trick is to symlink it to /dev/null but that feels somewhat sketchy
[13:57:57] <pj> yeah, I would probably just truncate the file.
[13:58:10] <earnestly> Because its not the first time Ivve seen null removed and replaced with a file called /dev/null
[13:58:23] <pj> or replace it with a file that has a one line comment, "# This file has been removed on purpose"
[13:58:26] <ormaaj> like debian... _interrupts_ the install with a retarded interactive prompt. "we see you changed a configuration. want us to wipe your changes?" no shit sherlock, and no.
[13:58:27] <earnestly> But it is the systemd way of masking off files
[13:58:55] <earnestly> pj: "Intentionally left blank" heh
[13:59:15] <pj> earnestly: yep, at least it's clear what's been done and why, that way.
[13:59:47] <earnestly> I like the irony of it though because by having that text there, it's no longer blank
[13:59:56] <pj> yeah, lol
[14:00:08] <earnestly> So the message becomes unnecessary, but to remove it would require it
[14:01:15] <pj> it's the ultimate paradox!
[14:03:07] <pj> what rpm will actualyl do when it encounters that file is it will wait until there's an update that would have changed that file, and if so it will just write the new file with an .rpmnew extension added on and output a warning about it, but not stop and prompt.

[17:35:29] <FreeBDSM> `which ping` showed /bin/ping. `ls -lash $(which ping)` showed it was `-rwsr-xr-x root:root`
[17:35:57] <FreeBDSM> I wanted to test whether it'd still work if I set it to -rwsr-x-r-- root:root

[17:43:54] <FreeBDSM> got it
[17:44:05] <emanuele6> FreeBDSM: because by default it runs as the user that executed it
[17:44:43] <emanuele6> setuid allows the program to call setuid(), after calling setuid(0), the program is running as the root user
[17:44:48] <FreeBDSM> I panicked a bit, thinking I didn't check what /bin/ping is (maybe that's a busybox-like alias to another binary) and that I somehow managed to screw ls
[17:45:56] <FreeBDSM> emanuele6: if I change owner of /bin/ping from root to something else (that has not enough permissions for ping to work properly), but leave setuid - I will screw up pinging for me, right?
[17:46:41] <FreeBDSM> (because the code is probably just setuid(), not setuid(0), or even it was setuid(0) - I no longer have access to that
[17:46:45] <emanuele6> /bin/ping would not be able to call setuid(0) then
[17:47:04] <emanuele6> but root will still be able to use it because setuid(0) would work
[17:47:16] <emanuele6> because it is root that is running it
[17:47:48] <emanuele6> but i guess it depends on how ping calls setuid()
[17:48:07] <FreeBDSM> why is the process still owned by my user instead of root?
[17:48:54] <emanuele6> because the euid is still the one of your user probably

[23:59:52] <tirnanog> anyway, the initial examples boil down to two things. firstly, don't have the invoking shell perform the expansion, hence the use of single quotes and the re-conveying of the intended parameters to bash -c. secondly, don't perform unsafe expansion within the given shellcode; that is, the argument which immediately follows -c.
