[01:28:22] <Joanna> Darn I missed an interesting discussion. It amazes me that people who can afford to aren’t wearing hazmat suits and decontaminating before they enter their homes. Instead they wander around wearing porous masks with a deadly pathogen potentially collecting on all exposed skin hair and clothing and then take it home with them. They also recklessly take off their masks to eat drink and smoke in hazardous areas !

[09:59:20] <Apachez> even if tcp "only" gives syn+ack in return if you have spoofed the initial srcip it means that the victim suddently gets shitloads of syn+ack and that will consume cpu due to logging and whatelse
[09:59:45] <Apachez> and if not hardened it means that the incoming syn+ack (to the victim) will result in a icmp sent back to the bouncer
[10:00:14] *** kitties is now known as catties
[10:00:23] <Apachez> which in its own also means that the incoming syn+ack except for logging also will hog system cpu for icmp (well depending on hardware but not uncommon that the "logic" is punted into system cpu to deal with)
[10:00:47] <Apachez> but sure using udp is more efficient because then the bouncer can send much larger packet than just a 64 byte syn+ack
[10:00:59] <Apachez> so except for alot of packets the victim will also have alot of incoming bandwidth
[10:01:50] <Apachez> TimMc: more like broken networks in between who doesnt apply for BCP (best common practice, such as source ip filtering at the source to block spoofing)

[18:03:04] <velix> try, I'Ll do some more reading
[18:03:34] <tomreyn> CA's, as well as intermediaries (which you are thinking of there) have to comply with very high standards in terms of security nowadays. they would also be considered liable for any bad practices and mistakes made an intermediary. so CA's can't really afford to support random organization X to become an intermediary, unless that organization can show that they're practicing security with the same scrutiny, during regular audits and in everyday
[18:03:34] <tomreyn> operation. this also involves a minimum of staff doing nothing else but maintinaing the intermediary.
[18:03:44] <tomreyn> and it would involve a lot of $, too
[18:04:10] <tomreyn> and even then only a fraction of CA's would be willing to do so.
[18:04:31] <velix> I see.

If I give you two long hexadecimal string then it is very difficult for you to compare them accurately. An old attack that is still fun is to create a key that doesn't have the same fingerprint (that's pretty much impossible) but one that has the same beginning and end. Most people will focus on these

[21:42:51] <piou> Apachez: but modern ssh does not use md5, it uses sha-256 so I see really no point in saying "flame did it so it's possible" in this context rather than giving a false sense of insecurity. Yes, in the absolute key fingerprint collision is something to keep in mind, but we're better at it than we were ten years ago and for all intents and purposes it's in practice impossible unless you have a bug

[21:43:34] <Apachez> piou: also sha256 is about to get abandoned

[21:44:01] <Apachez> funny how few results that gives on google searches ;)
[21:45:15] <piou> Hash: it's more than that, but sure, stuff like that. Attacking websites rarely relies on exploits, it's a lot about understanding the logic of the website, the assumptions that are made, and exploiting those in a constrained context because you need to deal with restrictions such as SOP that are applied at the browser level

[21:48:47] <piou> Apachez: sure, sha3 is better, but in the case of ssh keys it shouldn't matter (although that's an interesting point to check). The main possibly exploitable difference I can see is the fact that sha3 doesn't allow length extensions so if ssh is strict about key size for example then I don't think sha3 provides any practical benefit in their specific context
