[05:21:15] <JackFrost> As for frontends, mpv and smplayer are already supporting yt-dlp, as does gallery-dl.

[15:47:20] <pystardust> im trying to scrape youtube video url from the html page, here is what i have with 2 lines of shell https://0x0.st/o-xX.sh, it works but the links i get are really slow compared to the ones i get from yt-dlp, is it because I lack some headers?
[16:54:55] <ede> you mean the url= from signatureCypher? i get an empty reply with curl, even using your -H
[19:40:46] <pystardust> ede: something like this gives me a json output: bash youtube.sh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StE8nhHkEMI
[19:54:23] <ede> oh wait... didn't think of it, let me -iJ it
[19:55:09] <ede> 39003 vs 349996
[20:01:55] <ede> pystardust https://termbin.com/yz7j
[20:02:16] <ede> for format 18 from the page and the output of '-iJ'
[20:03:46] <pystardust> ede: what is -iJ ? are they curl options?
[20:04:28] <ede> nope. returns the JSON (j for playlist 1 video per line, J the whole thing including channel data)
[20:05:14] <ede> the ns= parameter is only available in one of the lines
[20:06:04] <pystardust> I see, u r talking about yt-dlp options, yeah i compared and say there was a difference (which is causing the speed barrier)
[20:06:12] <pystardust> saw*
[20:06:25] <ede> ah here we go. c=WEB vs c=ANDROID
[20:07:29] <pystardust> oh, btw yt-dlp uses a random useragent so u can expect that to be differnt 
[20:08:38] <ede> i think the trick is to use the android hook
[20:12:29] <pystardust> thanks, ill try using other useragents and seeing
[20:13:57] <ede> i don't think yt-dlp even uses the webpage as more than just an entry point. the JSON it gets is MUCH bigger than the one in the HTML
[20:15:33] <ede> youtube-dl gets 28k, yt-dlp 35k.
[20:16:09] <ede> er, 280 vs 350
[20:17:14] <pystardust> hmm, ill need to read the extractor/youtube.py fully
[20:17:28] <ede> that one is really, really big :)
[20:18:01] <ede> maybe look what the changes were when they forked it
[20:20:23] <pystardust> hmmm
