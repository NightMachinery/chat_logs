[20:59:23] <skye0> Snuupy when the ISP hub decided to fuck up while I was doing syncthing transfers for like the second time in the space of two weeks or so was when I decided to get a router for myself
[20:59:44] <Snuupy> haha
[20:59:48] <Snuupy> isp hardware is always aids
[21:00:00] <Snuupy> I'm on isp hardware right now and it's like stabbing myself over and over
[21:00:51] <skye0> well i was doing it over wifi which is even more cancerous
[21:01:20] <skye0> the whole syncthing transfers could be done without me connecting to WAN but the hub is in the living room, my systems are at the other side of my house in my bedroom

[21:09:22] <Snuupy> I'm on fiber right now though, 500/500
[21:09:27] <rawktucc> alright. i've sent 20TB alone this month so far :)
[21:09:31] <rawktucc> on my gigabit fiber
[21:09:31] <Snuupy> ah I'm 25
[21:09:39] <skye0> damn, i could only dream of those speeds. i got like 100/10
[21:09:44] <rawktucc> yeah i was on gigabit/30
[21:09:47] <rawktucc> and i got fed up
[21:10:08] <skye0> next payday i gotta get some of those rugged hard drives - topping out on storage for my current (external consumer) hard drives
[21:10:13] <Snuupy> at my previous place there was no fiber so best I could get was rawktucc's same plan
[21:10:25] <skye0> rawktucc gigabit/30? fuck, that sounds painful
[21:10:25] <Snuupy> I wasn't willing to pay $130 or whatever the fuck it was though so I stuck with 75/10
[21:10:27] <Snuupy> it was rough
[21:10:45] <Snuupy> new apartment is $65 500/500 or $85 gigabit symm
[21:10:48] <skye0> there are apparently fiber plans for my city but they're laying out the cables as we speak, so not so comprehensive despite the plans i've seen online
[21:11:50] <skye0> i need hardware upgrades not just for hoarding but for gaming. need cuda cores as well but for a very specific workflow, don't want to get into detail into it
[21:12:03] <skye0> can't play some of the halo infinite maps just because i can't reach 60fps on them

[21:33:19] <Snuupy> I prefer fastcopy viktorvond 
[21:33:34] <Snuupy> it has a verification option too which I find very useful
[21:34:08] <Snuupy> and it's not garbage premium paid software, it's free/source was provided until people abused it and tried to sell it
[21:34:29] <Snuupy> it also handles resumes well if the connection drops for whatever reason

[21:35:08] <viktorvond> thanks Snuupy... was just checking the general wiki link on it and nice that it can do longer paths... 
[21:35:52] <Snuupy> or if you cancel the transfer in the middle, I mean
[21:36:21] <viktorvond> i saw robocopy mentioned a lot but couldn't find specifics on selecting multiple directories (whole disk A might have 40 directories but i only want 10-15 specific ones), then i'll be deleting them after the copy is complete
[21:37:16] <Snuupy> if you want cmdline you can just do multiple robocopy commands
[21:37:30] <Snuupy> you have to specify the directories anyway
[21:37:38] <Snuupy> am I not understanding some context here?
[21:37:54] <viktorvond> oh i see, then something like running a batch with the instructions line by line for each directory
[21:38:30] <Snuupy> yup
[21:38:40] <Snuupy> same thing is happening whether you use terminal or a GUI
[21:38:47] <viktorvond> i was looking at one of the robocopy guides that come up from google search results and didn't see an example of adding multiple directories (usually it was just 1 folder or entire drive)
[21:38:58] <viktorvond> the one from tribblesoft i think for the gui?
[21:39:17] <Snuupy> personally I'd either robocopy if you want terminal or fastcopy if you want GUI
[21:40:18] <viktorvond> the latter looks good and thanks for the suggestion.... now the next plan is to find a better file manager over the stock windows one...

[21:41:45] <viktorvond> the most suggested ones are with some costs to the license... i think freecommander is available without but only 32bit (64bit is paid); directory opus seems to be the most popular paid... then total commander
[21:42:51] <viktorvond> was kind of going by the wikipedia reference "comparison of file managers" topic
[21:42:52] <rawktucc> if you're going to pay for a file copy program, why not just by crsync
[21:43:23] <rawktucc> cwRSync sorry https://www.itefix.net/cwrsync
[21:44:04] <viktorvond> wasn't aware of that one rawktucc ^ checking the link now
[21:44:19] <rawktucc> that said you can use rsync with cygwin on windows
[21:44:30] <rawktucc> robocopy is fine but it's not as robust as rsync
[21:44:54] <viktorvond> rsync i've heard of but see the variation to cwRSync now, thanks
[21:45:18] <x10> it's rsync packed up .....
[21:45:58] <x10> just use rsync, learn it if never used, it does everything you'll need and then some.
[21:47:27] <skye0> rsync is dependable if you don't have any awkward file related stuff. good if you're really limited on resources and don't want a GUI
[21:47:36] <skye0> and probably creates far fewer conflicts than like syncthing

[21:48:45] <viktorvond> i think when i have seen syncthing mentioned, freefilesync has come up from searches (there was some questionable bundled adware in the installer some years back but appears the developer removed it since)
[21:49:34] <x10> pearls before swine.
[21:53:00] <viktorvond> anyways the other options mentioned sound much better than what i've been doing with built-in windows copy; far too long of doing it that way
