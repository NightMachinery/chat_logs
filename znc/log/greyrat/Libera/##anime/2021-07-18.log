Otherwise, it's a cheap car that he didn't even really like in the first place (bought it used just four months ago), so he wouldn't mind just getting a new car.

[07:01:09] <Macer> so what is the isekai to watch this season?
[07:01:16] <Macer> since that's what nearly all anime is now heh
[07:01:36] <amigojapan> None Macer 
[07:01:42] <Jigsy> That Time I Got Reincarnated Into A Nine-to-Five Office Job.
[07:01:46] <amigojapan> No thanks
[07:01:53] <Macer> Jigsy: lol
[07:02:39] <amigojapan> Jigsy: was he a slime in his previous life?
[07:03:17] <Macer> Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki 
[07:03:36] <Macer> Suddenly summoned to a fantasy world and betrothed to the princess...
[07:04:25] <Jigsy> amigojapan: Yeah.
[07:04:26] <Jigsy> :D
[07:04:26] <amigojapan> Macer: more like,summoned to a fantasy world to be bored?
[07:04:37] <amigojapan> Hahaha Jigsy 
[07:05:15] <Macer> yah. the stereotypical high school virgin who is massively OP in some new world surrounded by hot women that want to jump him but he never does it?
[07:05:26] <Macer> i think i've seen that one before :) 
[07:06:00] <Nanobot> Remember: the word "salad" literally means "salted". So, any salted food is technically a salad. That includes my Fritos.
[07:07:09] <Macer> maybe sonny boy may be worth watching
[07:07:44] <amigojapan> Nanobot: what about when people say "that's a word salad"?
[07:08:32] <amigojapan> Macer: I can't wait until the isekai craze is over
[07:08:43] <Macer> oh. more seasons of irregular at magic high
[07:08:46] <Nanobot> That refers to using a wide variety of words, just like how a wide variety of salted foods count as salad.
[07:08:53] <Macer> amigojapan: it will just replaced by another one
[07:09:10] <Macer> i mean there was space harems.. then robot harems... then isekai harems...
[07:09:27] <Macer> like i said. kara no kyoukai ruined nearly all anime for me
[07:10:00] <amigojapan> Macer: the school anime craze at least has many interesting stories going on inside of it, unlike isekai

[07:10:12] <Nanobot> "salad" came from a shortened version of "herba salata", meaning salted vegetables. So, if you want to get picky, I guess I'll have to switch to potato chips to get a true salad.
[07:10:15] <SpiritOfSummer> this is my new song
[07:10:27] <SpiritOfSummer> yeah and you know what
[07:10:30] <SpiritOfSummer> wrong channel
[07:10:48] <Macer> amigojapan: toradora ruined those for me too haha
[07:11:09] <amigojapan> Ouch Macer 
[07:11:21] <Macer> we need more ufotable anime :/ 
[07:12:20] <amigojapan> Macer: the vtuber scene seems to be where interesting things are happening now
[07:12:21] <Macer> i think the slime in another world thing was of course copied with a girl spider 
[07:12:42] <Macer> so seems like being beasts isekai is catching traction 
[07:13:10] <amigojapan> Macer: the spider anime had a lot of promise, if it was just gritty
[07:13:35] <amigojapan> Macer: making it into an RPG ruined it
[07:14:01] <Macer> meh. it was just your typical copy of the same sort of anime
[07:14:21] <Macer> i mean i can watch them but i most likely will never watch them again
[07:14:40] <amigojapan> It should have been dark and gritty
[07:14:45] <Macer> the rewatch value of anime is ridiculously low for quite a while
[07:15:28] <Macer> could probably rewatch a few but far fewer than stuff from the 2000s-2010s
[07:15:49] <Jigsy> I should probably rewatch Sketchbook ~Full ColorS~.

The girl wakes up, meows, and hops onto MC's chest. "Wow! This girl must still be drunk. This is very inappropriate behavior between strangers!" The girl looks at MC and then licks his face. "OMG, her breath smells like cat food! She must have drunkenly eaten my cat's food!" That's when MC notices that 
[07:34:08] <Nanobot> the girl has cat ears, a cat tail, and a collar that looks just like those belonging to MC's cat. "OMG! Why the hell is this girl cosplaying as my cat?!" The girl gets up and says, "I put your cat in a meat grinder and hoped you wouldn't notice he's missing."

[10:09:54] <ButterNoodle> japan is the motherland of slr

[10:11:04] <ButterNoodle> slr has been around in film form for a long time tho
[10:11:39] <ButterNoodle> like the 50s iirc
[10:12:30] <amigojapan> Right, but I did not know, it was never explained to me. My grandfather had a black and white camera which you looked at the view from above. Maybe it was slr from the 1920s
[10:12:33] <ButterNoodle> some of the early digital slr cameras were just 35mm slr cameras that were retrofitted w digital sensors
[10:12:49] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: that sounds like medium format

[10:14:54] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: yeah. What is the difference between that and be slr?
[10:15:17] <ButterNoodle> slr is more about the mechanical function. there are slr medium format cameras
[10:15:35] <ButterNoodle> you see through the lens basically
[10:15:37] <amigojapan> Aren't you looking out the same lens on both?
[10:15:50] <ButterNoodle> not on a point and shoot
[10:15:56] <Sadale> ancient technology :3
[10:16:01] <ButterNoodle> naa
[10:16:03] <Sadale> how fanscinating :3
[10:16:29] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: we use the same mechanics, just instead of film we use a cmos sensor to capture the image
[10:16:39] <Sadale> ah!
[10:16:43] <amigojapan> I wish my grandfather had given me that camera
[10:16:53] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, Now that's modern techonology :P
[10:17:00] <ButterNoodle> if it was medium format.. the film is expensive to develop
[10:17:34] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: my dad said most people would develop their own
[10:17:39] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: I was gonna bring up that some of the early digital slrs were just retrofitted canon slrs.. *kodak did the upgrades

[10:18:39] <ButterNoodle> well tbh Sadale the slr cameras today are point and shoot

[10:20:33] <ButterNoodle> because film doesnt necessarily have a resolution
[10:20:56] <ButterNoodle> thats how they are re-releasing old movies in higher resolutions
[10:21:03] <ButterNoodle> they just rescan the stuff

[10:21:17] <Sadale> amigojapan, no I didn't
[10:21:43] <ButterNoodle> I mean you wont get better frame rates than the 24fps it was shot on but you can rescan the film at higher resolutions
[10:21:46] <Sadale> The film is far more difficult to store tho
[10:21:56] <ButterNoodle> it does keep for a long time
[10:21:59] <ButterNoodle> once developed
[10:22:09] <amigojapan> Sadale: yeah. The company ended up crashing after digital cameras became the norm
[10:22:12] <Sadale> I actually suspect that there's a limit on the "resolution" of the film because of len distortion and stuffs
[10:22:31] <ButterNoodle> not lens distortion.. the grain of the film
[10:22:39] <Sadale> I mean yes, you could scan it with better equipment to get a better resolution image. But that doesn't mean that the image would be of higher quality
[10:22:47] <ButterNoodle> there are some good videos that explain the grain or ISO
[10:22:48] <Sadale> What's the grain of the film?
[10:22:57] <Sadale> amigojapan, RIP
[10:23:41] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, ah I found that on wikipedia
[10:23:45] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: the actual components that make up the picture of the film
[10:23:55] <ButterNoodle> its kinda like the resolution..
[10:24:26] <Sadale> I see. It'd mean that, technically speaking, film is no better than digital assuming the resolution of the digital one is higher than the film grain.
[10:24:52] <ButterNoodle> no
[10:24:54] <ButterNoodle> it is better
[10:25:10] <ButterNoodle> anything shot on digital will always be at that resolution
[10:25:17] <amigojapan> Sadale: grain is not pixels tho
[10:25:28] <ButterNoodle> anything shot on film can be rescanned with better tech
[10:25:34] <Sadale> Apparently grain is a kind of noise.
[10:25:38] <ButterNoodle> so when 8k or 16k comes out
[10:25:58] <Sadale> Honestly I think 4K is overkill for computer monitor
[10:26:07] <ButterNoodle> they can rescan that old 35mm stuff to whatever
[10:26:30] <amigojapan> Sadale: 4k should be only for super huge screens
[10:26:36] <Sadale> yep.
[10:26:46] <Sadale> Yet those marketing people are whoring on the specs :/
[10:27:00] <Sadale> No way that I'm gonna need 4K for a 15" LCD.
[10:27:54] <amigojapan> Sadale: people like larger numbers. And they keep saying "you can notice the difference"but I think it does not matter if you can notice the difference when HD was already good enough
[10:28:25] <Sadale> true. sad.
[10:28:37] <Sadale> I do notice the difference between 30fps and 60fps tho
[10:28:43] <Sadale> No sure if I'd notice 60 vs 120.
[10:29:08] <amigojapan> Ok. But does the difference really matter?
[10:29:33] <Sadale> I think it matters for VR. I've heard that for VR 120Hz is minimum
[10:29:41] <Sadale> 60Hz would make you dizzy as fuck
[10:29:49] <amigojapan> Ok
[10:29:53] <Sadale> For normal daily use tho, I'm not so sure.
[10:30:05] <amigojapan> Alright
[10:31:33] <ButterNoodle> naa
[10:31:41] <amigojapan> Sadale: I hope Nintendo releases a vr console
[10:31:45] <ButterNoodle> there are some shit resolutions in vr
[10:47:27] <Bco1981> amigojapan: "4k should be only for super huge screens" i agree. i have a 70" 4K tv, and when i set the damn windows zoomlevel to 100%, and not it's recommended 300% then 70" for 4K seems perfect for icon size and text. but i can't but much more then 1,5m away from the screen then i can't read that small text.
[10:48:14] <Bco1981> *but i can't be much more then*
[10:49:37] <Bco1981> Sadale: flat monitor or vr, anything more then 60 matters.

[12:48:47] <JesseDesu> the max resolution in that fake camera overlay is 640
[12:48:58] <JesseDesu> appropriate for a show about 2006
[12:49:13] <ButterNoodle> ?
[12:49:17] <JesseDesu> remember when point and shoot cameras were a thing

[12:49:19] <ButterNoodle> like digital camera?

[12:49:29] <lastonestanding> ohh
[12:49:29] <JesseDesu> yea
[12:49:34] <ButterNoodle> naa they were 1-3 megapixel
[12:49:35] <lastonestanding> I remember digital cameras
[12:49:49] <ButterNoodle> 640 would have been the late 90s
[12:49:54] <lastonestanding> we had a Olympus camera
[12:49:57] <lastonestanding> very early
[12:50:16] <JesseDesu> i had a canon 
[12:50:32] <JesseDesu> then i went with sony
[12:50:46] <ButterNoodle> I had a 3MP in 2001
[12:51:04] <JesseDesu> i was checking out what cameras were used by pretty emo teens on myspace
[12:51:07] <lastonestanding> "Olympus Corporation („Ç™„É™„É≥„Éë„ÇπÊ†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ, Orinpasu Kabushiki-gaisha) is a Japanese manufacturer of optics and reprography products."
[12:51:12] <lastonestanding> they are actually japanese
[12:51:15] <lastonestanding> :O
[12:51:40] <ButterNoodle> a lot are
[12:52:08] <lastonestanding> that is why I thought that maybe this particular one is not
[12:52:30] <JesseDesu> butternoodle you also thought 512mb was plenty for an arch boot partition for years to come
[12:53:08] <JesseDesu> what is the recommendation now anyway
[12:53:32] <il> 1tb
[12:54:12] <ButterNoodle> 10tb
[12:54:19] <ButterNoodle> 512 is still good
[12:54:41] <ButterNoodle> 100 is the problem
[12:56:56] <Sadale> wow. 10TB is huge

[15:35:33] <JesseDesu> what is chaos?  is it like k-os!
[15:36:01] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: believe it or not. I had a dream. With a simple character in it. When I got up I drew it as well as I could. It was a bear with bat wings, shots with maze prayer on them

[16:24:30] <Urchin[emacs]> there are youtube podcasts, which are podcasts as long as main content is the audio
[16:24:44] <Bco1981> but you do not HAVE to look at them, you could just have it running in the background.
[16:24:59] <Sumida> ok
[16:25:23] <amigojapan> I see Urchin[emacs] but they have days they did like the drifting special
[16:25:56] <Sumida> then you could just use the audio and add some still image
[16:26:11] <amigojapan> Bco1981: the drifting special you need to watch
[16:26:44] <amigojapan> Sumida: yeah. I told that to ButterNoodle but he did not want to do it
[16:27:37] * Sumida thinks it will never happen if everything has to be perfect
[16:27:52] <amigojapan> I agree
[16:28:27] <amigojapan> Sumida: maybe I should just get Saganman and record the first episode with him
[16:29:40] <amigojapan> I think I will aim for next week then
[16:31:36] <amigojapan> Sumida: spoonm set up a mumble server so we can do it
[16:31:49] <spoonm> do you need the connection details or something?
[16:31:53] <amigojapan> And we already tested it with audio only
[16:32:10] <Sumida> you can call it episode 0
[16:32:12] <amigojapan> spoonm: I wrote them down
[16:32:35] <amigojapan> spoonm: but ButterNoodle did not want to record
[16:33:34] <amigojapan> spoonm: I think he still wants it to have video. O think we can start up with audio only
[16:33:45] <amigojapan> I think

[17:16:29] <amigojapan> I see fragrantica . That's too bad :(
[17:16:32] <mixfix41> good mythical morning does it
[17:17:06] <fragrantica> oxygen doesn't smell like anything, I think
[17:17:23] <mixfix41> you have to bubble it in different source like rett and link do
[17:17:40] <fragrantica> hah?
[17:17:49] <mixfix41> watch the episode link is cool hes a hip hop fan
[17:18:08] <fragrantica> watch where?
[17:18:33] <mixfix41> its an episode on youtube just search it its not hard to find goodmythicalmorning
[17:19:32] <mixfix41> its probs call does it smell good good mythical morning
[17:19:49] <mixfix41> or name that source 
[17:19:52] <mixfix41> through oxygen mask
[17:20:06] <mixfix41> cause they actually guess the scent they are trying each soruce
[17:20:30] <fragrantica> the point of perfume is that it should smell good for people near me, not just for me
[17:21:18] <fragrantica> so I don't really get your suggestion
[17:21:29] <mixfix41> yea thats true.
[17:22:53] <amigojapan> fragrantica: I have wanted to buy Colone for me, but tomako does not like perfumes :(
[17:23:57] <fragrantica> aww how sad to hear that
[17:24:54] <Roey> I like how girls smell just after a shower with nice soap
[17:25:16] <Roey> they don't even need perfume to smell good
[17:30:11] <amigojapan> Roey: but I like presume
[17:30:28] <amigojapan> It's like consecrated flowers
[17:31:25] <amigojapan> Roey: also I want to wear Colone. Just cause I like the smell
[17:32:33] <amigojapan> fragrantica: yeah it's not as popular in Japan as it is in Mexico
[17:33:06] <amigojapan> It's rare to smell perfume here
[17:34:56] <fragrantica> not everything smells like flowers
[17:35:08] <amigojapan> True
[17:35:36] <amigojapan> fragrantica: I lack the vocabulary to describe it
[17:35:49] <Roey> ahhhhh :)
[17:38:10] <fragrantica> some popular men's fragrances have notes like leather, tobacco, amber, honey, woods, musk, etc.
[17:40:19] <amigojapan> fragrantica: is it true they use cat pee to make the smell of perfume stringer?at least I heard that rumour in the past

[19:34:31] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, it's also about how much the body can actually make use of at the time without becoming sick. You also can't wait too long, or it won't work as efficiently

[19:36:09] <amigojapan> I see Cryowolf . Wonder why the difference
[19:36:12] <Cryowolf> Sumida, it's also that when most people are vaccinated, you are sort of protected anyway since there's herd immunity
[19:36:34] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, I don't know. Maybe our doctors made a different calculation for efficiency
[19:36:54] <Sumida> well, most people are not vaccinated

[19:37:23] <Cryowolf> In Sweden like 35% are vaccinated atm with two doses
[19:37:29] <Cryowolf> another 20% with one
[19:37:35] <Cryowolf> somewhere around that
[19:37:57] <Cryowolf> maybe it was reversed though, either way we've got a lot of people lining up for it
[19:38:17] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I am glad it is 3 weeks for me, cause the first shot was pretty rough
[19:38:20] <Cryowolf> and nobody wanted astra zenica. It was also banned
[19:38:38] <Cryowolf> so was johnson johnson √§r whatever it was called
[19:38:48] <mixfix41> funny to bring it up cause when you look into it you dig another piece of information on it
[19:38:48] <Cryowolf> or*
[19:39:27] <mixfix41> the vaccine last i search is working effectively. though the guy was questioning the decision to allow air travel tho
[19:39:39] <mixfix41> and herd immunity would be nice
[19:39:55] <Cryowolf> Sweden allows air travel with two vaccine shots
[19:40:04] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I was allowed to take a day off work after each shot. That is something I am recommending everyone do
[19:40:29] <Cryowolf> they've also tested for the Indian version and say that the current vaccine is effective against it but with lesser efficiency than the regular and the British
[19:41:31] <Cryowolf> once my chemo and radiation are done and I can take the vaccine, I'm also gonna demand they fix my navel hernia and then give me rehab on the post operative complication I have so I can get off these painkillers. Then I hope I won't need more chemo
[19:41:39] <Cryowolf> but never know, I'm prepared for that I might
[19:42:18] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: you are very brave
[19:42:27] <Cryowolf> why? O.o
[19:42:35] <Cryowolf> I mean thank you
[19:42:36] <Cryowolf> but why?
[19:43:01] <amigojapan> Tomako says that chemo was one of the worst experiences she has ever had
[19:43:53] <Cryowolf> It's horrible. But if you're facing a beast that wants to kill you, then you need to use every tool available
[19:44:06] <amigojapan> True
[19:44:25] <Cryowolf> I can handle sickness. I will complain about it. But I will go through it and see it through to the end
[19:45:07] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: later she was also told that chemo does not work on the kind of cancer she had anyway

[19:46:08] <Cryowolf> my new cytostatic (they switched me mid treatment, it was planned this way from the start) is easier but still makes me fatigued. It makes me weaker than the other one and more tired, a little less nausea but still brainfog, bad memory, hard time finding words
[19:46:29] <Cryowolf> I can forget an entire conversation at the blink of an eye while I'm in the middle of it

[19:49:50] <theholyduck> :(
[19:49:53] <amigojapan> shirafuno: positive on covid!? That is terrible. Everyone from England seems to be getting it

[19:50:37] <theholyduck> shirafuno:  oof :P 
[19:50:50] <Jigsy> I decided to forego wearing clothes today.
[19:50:51] <shirafuno> But because i'm younger (27) I wasn't a priority.

[19:51:05] <theholyduck> eh?
[19:51:25] <amigojapan> shirafuno: I am in the same situation. I should get my second dose on the 4rth of August
[19:51:34] <Jigsy> I've had both my vaccinations.
[19:51:47] <shirafuno> yeah... Just like Americans and the Iraq war. It's gotten too expensive so now they want to pretend it doesn't exist anymore

[19:52:07] <Cryowolf> I'm a medical miracle though, to make a long story short. My tumor grew to 11kgs 45cms in 2.5 months. Any size above 10cms on this cancer (MPNST) usually (99.99999% cases) means it has gone vascular and mestastetized. Mine however hadn't even gone vascular
[19:52:18] <Cryowolf> much less mestastesized
[19:52:19] <fragrantica> two vaccines means you don't need to wear clothes

[19:53:00] <fragrantica> wow
[19:53:02] <Cryowolf> I hope so. THe only way to defeat MPNST is surgery until the tumor is gone and then chemo to kill the  remaining cells

[19:53:11] <Jigsy> Wound up having one hell of a headache yesterday/this morning because of the heat.
[19:53:17] <Cryowolf> I was very lucky
[19:53:20] <Cryowolf> and had good surgeons
[19:53:25] <Cryowolf> they had to remove some organs though
[19:53:28] <theholyduck> shirafuno: seems like a pretty reckless thing to do
[19:53:34] <Cryowolf> but I'm happy to have had such good surgeons
[19:53:51] <Cryowolf> now I have good oncologists
[19:55:13] <Cryowolf> I have two cycles of chemo left before evaluation and then making decision if I should have radiation therapy or not.
[19:55:22] <Cryowolf> next chemo is on wednesday 21st

[19:55:58] <Cryowolf> but please don't treat me as "that guy with cancer", talk to me as you would anyone
[19:56:06] <theholyduck> and then its going to be 12 more weeks
[19:56:09] <theholyduck> until i get the second
[19:56:22] <amigojapan> theholyduck: oh so less than a month. That's good news
[19:56:37] <theholyduck> i dunno if its going to be less than a month
[19:56:50] <mixfix41> Jigsy: find a good slab to transfer some of your forearm heat to
[19:56:50] <theholyduck> i live in a county with about 20k people in it
[19:56:54] <theholyduck> im in the last vaccination group
[19:56:56] <amigojapan> theholyduck: 12 more weeks? That does not sound right
[19:57:01] <theholyduck> so far we have vaccinated 10579 people
[19:57:08] <theholyduck> amigojapan: norway is doing 12 weeks between first jab
[19:57:09] <theholyduck> and second jab
[19:57:23] <theholyduck> er 10579 people with 1 jab
[19:57:24] <theholyduck> rather
[19:57:31] <theholyduck> and we are adding jabs at about 700 a week
[19:57:40] <amigojapan> theholyduck: I have 3 weeks
[19:57:49] <theholyduck> yeah i think thats like the reccomended spacing
[19:58:10] <theholyduck> but... we arent getting enough vaccines to do that without giving the later people completely the shaft
[19:58:39] <amigojapan> I see theholyduck 
[19:59:04] <theholyduck> so yeah im not entirely sure how long its going to take. but at 700 or so doses a week for my county its still going to be quite a few weeks until i get my first one
[19:59:22] <amigojapan> I see
[19:59:31] <theholyduck> and then 12 MORE weeks until i get my second shot
[19:59:46] <Cryowolf> 12 is a bit too long
[19:59:56] <Cryowolf> they're risking efficiency there
[20:00:00] <theholyduck> i dont disgree
[20:00:24] <theholyduck> part of the reason they are doing it is we experienced like a million dose shortfall of pzifer
[20:00:28] <theholyduck> over the summer
[20:00:35] <theholyduck> compared to what we thought we were getting
[20:00:39] <theholyduck> and in a nation of 5 million people
[20:00:47] <theholyduck> a million dose shortfall is a lot
[20:02:14] <amigojapan> theholyduck: are you importing it from America? We are
[20:03:10] <theholyduck> i think both pzifer and moderna have multple places they make their stuff
[20:03:27] <amigojapan> I see
[20:03:31] <theholyduck> we are getting our vaccines VIA the european union joint purchasing 
[20:03:46] <amigojapan> Gotcha
[20:04:01] <Cryowolf> ooh
[20:04:28] <Cryowolf> Sweden got a ton of pfizer and moderna, we have a lot of pfizer production facilities
[20:04:33] <theholyduck> but yeah in THEORY im supposed to be offered a vaccination within a month from now.  
[20:04:35] <Cryowolf> so it's easier forr us to get
[20:05:00] <Cryowolf> but theyve been moving through phases to ensure everyone gets 2 doses
[20:05:23] <Cryowolf> the phases are for who is at greatest risk of death from catching it in a risk analysis
[20:05:32] <amigojapan> Altho I heard Japan is now working on making its own vaccine. I am glad I got Pfizer

[20:05:37] <theholyduck> for my local county
[20:05:58] <theholyduck> sooo. all the groups in blue are vaccinated. and most of them are fully or will be fully soon
[20:06:18] <Cryowolf> I was in phase 4 in Sweden cause of my risk group (no spleen, cancer etc)
[20:06:25] <Cryowolf> but they offered it too late
[20:06:30] <Cryowolf> I had already started chemo
[20:08:07] <Cryowolf> hmmm  1000x500x4 mm acrylic plastic (plexiglass), I wonder if this would work for a custom computer case
[20:08:24] <Cryowolf> or if starts to warp too soon
[20:08:27] <theholyduck> i mean. people USED to make cases out of acrylic
[20:08:32] <amigojapan> theholyduck: what does the first group on that chart mean?
[20:08:52] <Cryowolf> theholyduck, yes but does it warp relatively quickly?
[20:08:54] <theholyduck> people who live or work in health institutions
[20:08:57] <theholyduck> warp how?
[20:09:13] <theholyduck> well all healthcare workers
[20:09:14] <Cryowolf> the plastic is designed to bend when exposed to high heat
[20:09:19] <Cryowolf> like a heat gun
[20:09:23] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[20:09:24] <Cryowolf> so you can shape it
[20:09:25] <theholyduck> sure. not "computer" heat
[20:09:39] <Cryowolf>   well some thtings run pretty hot
[20:09:42] <theholyduck> i made several enclosures for hot stuff out of acrylic
[20:09:50] <Cryowolf> I need to figure out how to isolate that well enough
[20:09:55] <theholyduck> like 
[20:10:03] <theholyduck> it starts to soften at boiling water hot?
[20:10:03] <Cryowolf> I also wanted to make the corners out of aluminium
[20:10:08] <Cryowolf> for structural integrity
[20:10:34] <theholyduck> why not just buy one? 
[20:10:37] <Cryowolf> and run copper pipes through the corners
[20:10:46] <theholyduck> you can buy a lasercut acrylic case for like no money on ali_-express
[20:10:46] <Cryowolf> cause I want to make one
[20:11:05] <theholyduck> speaking as somebody who has lasecut a lot of acrylic in his day :P 
[20:11:07] <Cryowolf> good for them but, I have nothing to do all day
[20:11:16] <theholyduck> my suggestion is use wood or something instead :P
[20:11:28] <Cryowolf> ...no thank you
[20:11:28] <theholyduck> acrylic loves to crack
[20:11:35] <theholyduck> when you try to put threads or anything into it
[20:11:45] <Cryowolf> well it says you can drill in it
[20:11:52] <theholyduck> you CAN yes 
[20:11:59] <Cryowolf> that it's made of PMMA
[20:12:00] <theholyduck> sorta
[20:12:09] <theholyduck> yes thats what acrylic is
[20:12:28] <Cryowolf> I can find other types of plexi
[20:12:35] <theholyduck> all plexiglass
[20:12:37] <theholyduck> is acrylic
[20:12:39] <Cryowolf> but I do want to build my own case
[20:12:43] <fragrantica> plant a computer seed and watch it grow
[20:12:45] <theholyduck> there are other transparent plastics 
[20:13:05] <Cryowolf> fine other plastic glass then
[20:13:25] <Cryowolf> I will build the form with aluminium for structural integrity
[20:13:27] <theholyduck> anyways im not saying you ABSOLUTLY cant. im just saying its a pain to work with :P
[20:13:40] <theholyduck> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/MrGM8iEJ/image.png
[20:13:41] <theholyduck> heres a thing i made out of acrlyic some years ago
[20:13:46] <ImoutoBot> [image/png] 3.1MB
[20:13:48] <Cryowolf> that's np. I'm planning to do a lot of things as a hobby
[20:13:52] <theholyduck> a 5 axis foamcutter driver
[20:13:58] <Cryowolf> buy cheap stuff, make stuff and maybe sell it for more
[20:14:19] <Cryowolf> can't I use a saw on a multitool? :P
[20:14:36] <theholyduck> its GOING to crack
[20:14:38] <theholyduck> so no?
[20:14:46] <theholyduck> even drilling acrylic if you arent careful
[20:14:48] <theholyduck> will cause it to split
[20:15:11] <Cryowolf> well other plastic glass then
[20:15:35] <theholyduck> they most have this problem as far as i know. 
[20:15:59] <theholyduck> anyways you CAN cut acrylic by hand. but the common method is to like scratch the line many times
[20:16:01] <Cryowolf> meh SAN is also acrylic huh?
[20:16:01] <theholyduck> with like a knice
[20:16:04] <theholyduck> and then "snapping"
[20:16:07] <theholyduck> SAN isnt acrylic no
[20:16:12] <theholyduck> and you cant laser-cut it 
[20:16:18] <Cryowolf> so I can saw it?
[20:16:22] <theholyduck> dunno never tried
[20:16:25] <amigojapan> Brb
[20:16:38] <theholyduck> i tried laser cutting it. it didnt work
[20:16:40] <Cryowolf> it warps at 106 C
[20:16:55] <theholyduck> sooo. i went back to acrylic and wood which can be laser-cut :P
[20:16:58] <Cryowolf> you need it at 160-195 C to shape it
[20:17:04] <Cryowolf> but I dont need to shape
[20:17:08] <Cryowolf> only drill and saw
[20:17:13] <mixfix41> bust a jigsaw out
[20:17:32] <mixfix41> i was watching exocontralto on yt and he got me to buy one
[20:17:45] <Cryowolf> then they have polycarbonate
[20:17:50] <mixfix41> i actually bought a few things cause of him hes fun to watch
[20:18:18] <Cryowolf> maybe polycarbonate is the best one
[20:18:55] <Cryowolf> says on specs they can be sawed, heatshaped, drilled etc
[20:19:51] <Cryowolf> with it I can build a nice completely transparent custom case. I'll create wind tunnels and stuff. To make sure there's proper airflow and exchange
[20:22:48] <mixfix41> too much work i have a computer with heating issues but i know its either something physical or something malfunctioning so but its a previous generation mobo than the gaming mobo on my main
[20:23:23] <mixfix41> still good strength to investigate into eventually
[20:24:26] <mixfix41> if you want WaterCool pc get a light metal case thats a step up from the smaller towers so medium size or lightest large metal case
[20:24:40] <mixfix41> with a lot of drive slots

[20:33:06] <mixfix41> if yuo can get the pump and the radiator you can customize it from there 
[20:33:10] <Bco1981> yeah i saw linus test it
[20:33:33] <mixfix41> better to get it AIO
[20:33:40] <Cryowolf> mixfix41, I don't want nor needd it when thermosiphon is better and cheaper than even the most expensive watercooling rigs out there
[20:33:42] <mixfix41> cheaper the better
[20:34:06] <Cryowolf> zero reason to get it

[20:36:25] <Cryowolf> you can adjust it to go far above the sticks
[20:36:37] <mixfix41> i havnt honestly use the computer as a main but i plan to once i want to setup storage or w/e
[20:36:47] <mixfix41> i know it runs without error so far

[20:37:24] <Bco1981> that is tempting... i'm not too happy with my AIO.
[20:37:29] <mixfix41> but its held by clamps too
[20:37:40] <mixfix41> the marketing of spills im not sure i have to worry much with mine
[20:37:53] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, tempting for me too but I dont have money. But once I do and I have a new gpu
[20:37:55] <mixfix41> cause the thing thats the biggest danger is the pump is not running well
[20:37:56] <Cryowolf> I will get one
[20:38:00] <mixfix41> so you have to maintain the fluid inside
[20:38:00] <Bco1981> i have put in limiters to my cpu, so it does not run up to 90C
[20:38:14] <Cryowolf> what are you talking about mixfix41?
[20:38:22] <Cryowolf> are you monloguing?
[20:38:27] <mixfix41> The most devastating cooler failure that can occur is a water leak, which will destroy your electronics. Instead, the ProSiphon Elite contains a dielectric fluid- electronics could bathe in the fluid and work perfectly fine.
[20:38:35] <mixfix41> me?
[20:38:37] <mixfix41> ofc not
[20:38:40] <mixfix41> im no poser
[20:38:45] <mixfix41> what are u sayin?
[20:38:48] <Cryowolf> then what are you talking about?
[20:38:53] <mixfix41> here wait
[20:38:58] <mixfix41> im urbandictinoary monologuing
[20:39:05] <mixfix41> !g urbandictinoary monologuing

[20:39:22] <Cryowolf> mayube go by the actual real dictionary definition instead
[20:39:24] <mixfix41> im only sharing experience
[20:39:38] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: he is talking about the handmedown AIO.
[20:39:43] <Cryowolf> okay
[20:40:10] <mixfix41> just saying its not prefer then ignore it its no harm
[20:40:14] <mixfix41> its only watercoolering method
[20:40:19] <mixfix41> a cooper cooler is good too
[20:40:40] <Cryowolf> well, Ive never had watercooling but I'll never use it. Too much risk, too expensive if you want it to beat top tier air cooling. You need pumps, you need hoses, you need fans, you need room for everything etc
[20:40:48] <Bco1981> i don't like that my cpu runs up to 90C, so i want a better cooling
[20:41:13] <Cryowolf> the thermosiphon is just so much better at how it does it and it beats out both top tier watercooling and top tier air cooling
[20:41:19] <Cryowolf> they mave it smaller too
[20:41:25] <Cryowolf> so I'm very interested in it
[20:41:49] <mixfix41> i agree its for looks and style
[20:41:57] <mixfix41> but its funny though its water inside
[20:42:22] <Cryowolf> there's liquid in the pipes of regular air coolers too
[20:42:25] <Cryowolf> you do know this?
[20:42:46] <mixfix41> no but you cant skimp a big radiator fan cool its the hutch of the setup
[20:43:25] *** Quits: AGZ (~AGZ@77.16.216.35.tmi.telenormobil.no) (Quit: Going offline, see ya! (www.adiirc.com))
[20:43:26] <Cryowolf> it's designed to cycle it from vapor to water and let thevapor reach the top where it condenses and flows back down
[20:43:41] <Cryowolf> and from their tests, it works great
[20:44:31] <Bco1981> the only thing i like about my current AIO... is that it does not fill up the entire case like my old noctua nh-d15
[20:44:31] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, how can a Danish store charge so fucking much for it?
[20:44:35] <Cryowolf> are they insane?
[20:44:43] <Bco1981> apparently
[20:45:03] <Bco1981> that much does not cover the usual danish tax and customs
[20:45:13] <Cryowolf> Or is it becausepeople are dumb enough to pay that? I mean you go to the official site and it's 1/5 of it and there's no custom toll or vat etc that will make it cost that much
[20:45:27] <Bco1981> well it does cover... but it's alomost double then.
[20:45:30] <Cryowolf> most you might pay in tax etc is 500
[20:45:51] <mixfix41> you get a chance examine the radiator thats even better before buying it without knowing it will give you a good idea by just holding it
[20:46:06] <Cryowolf> eh?
[20:46:07] <Bco1981> and if i get it from germany there won't be customs
[20:46:11] <mixfix41> im serious
[20:46:14] <mixfix41> if you buy it before
[20:46:27] <mixfix41> then you will grasp and the installation will feel less plan
[20:46:36] <Cryowolf> mixfix41, so you're telling me to pay 5x as much??
[20:46:41] <mixfix41> no
[20:46:48] <Cryowolf> and why are you saying radiator?
[20:46:53] <Cryowolf> let's just call it icegiant
[20:47:00] <mixfix41> because those parts are well made even a ten year old one
[20:47:13] <Cryowolf> "radiator" sounds like you're insulting it
[20:47:15] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: the weird thing is that on pricerunner there are 5 stores at around that price... or higher..
[20:47:30] <mixfix41> but its exactly a radiator 
[20:47:40] <mixfix41> the fluid runs through small pipes like a car radiator
[20:47:57] <mixfix41> or tubes buts its all aluminum
[20:47:59] <Cryowolf> .....
[20:48:06] <mixfix41> you couldnt repair it if you broke it
[20:48:10] <mixfix41> just like a car one
[20:48:52] <mixfix41> im not sure about that perception of the definition. ice giant is slang compare to the word radiator
[20:49:06] <mixfix41> or company name
[20:49:39] <Cryowolf> I've lost interest in this conversation now
[20:49:45] <hassoon> why am i not feeling well damn
[20:49:50] <Cryowolf> you killed it for me mixfix41, well done
[20:50:09] <mixfix41> im just an enthusiasts (i didnt even pay for mine)
[20:51:49] <Bco1981> that icegiant, you have to remove it to change ram
[20:52:00] <Cryowolf> hmmm I want to make my computer case one that lies down a bit.
[20:52:09] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, I have to do that now with my air cooler
[20:58:01] <mixfix41> on the real i prefer stock coolers
[20:58:06] <mixfix41> cause it signals if something is wrong
[20:58:23] <mixfix41> then if you have the luxury is definite only WC for style and entertainment
[20:59:39] <mixfix41> stock coolers are for gamers
[20:59:52] <Bco1981> lol
[21:00:02] <Cryowolf> I wonder if there are motherboards that come in "pieces"
[21:00:04] <mixfix41> my gaming i mean
[21:00:06] <Bco1981> very not effective compared
[21:00:12] <Cryowolf> like I can move them around
[21:00:21] <mixfix41> would ur pc turn off if you had a stock fan bco?
[21:00:24] <Cryowolf> move ram to one area, connected by a cable
[21:00:29] <Cryowolf> move PCI-Eto another
[21:00:46] <Bco1981> mixfix41: it would thermalthrottle 100% of the time.
[21:01:23] <mixfix41> but thats for the highest performing games though
[21:01:30] <mixfix41> most other games it wouldnt
[21:01:35] <Bco1981> that would be just youtube
[21:01:56] <mixfix41> hmm
[21:02:12] <mixfix41> thats makes me think we have some constant differences cause i cant picture it
[21:02:39] <Bco1981> right now with a 240mm AIO and power limited, and cpu voltage offset -0.1v watching a youube video, the cpu is about 60C ish.
[21:02:55] <mixfix41> this is just normal 4 gig ram, 4 core processors, it should get too hot (670 nvidia)
[21:03:02] <mixfix41> shoulnt
[21:03:29] <mixfix41> youtube has higher quality too
[21:03:39] <mixfix41> so you go for maximum quality 
[21:03:50] <Bco1981> just 1080p60
[21:03:53] <Bco1981> not 4k
[21:04:14] <mixfix41> video at those sizes might crunch it more i dunno
[21:04:27] <mixfix41> but 720 my eyes are already seeing the digital
[21:04:42] <mixfix41> 1080 is nice
[21:04:56] <mixfix41> but im not too sure maybe it shouldnt draw that issue tho
[21:06:15] <Bco1981> Warranty: 10 years... really tempting
[21:06:29] <mixfix41> see i really dont look at the sensor either if it doesnt turn off so theres that
[21:06:51] <mixfix41> cause if it runs and keeps running i think usually (since i can game quite a while for days) theres no problems
[21:06:52] <Cryowolf> theyve made things be less hot in recent years too
[21:07:04] <mixfix41> well
[21:07:06] <Cryowolf> I run my 5600x just fine at full load
[21:07:08] <mixfix41> my boards arent that new either
[21:07:09] <Bco1981> if you start to feel warm in your room because the pc is pumping out hot air... you might feel different.
[21:07:15] <Cryowolf> I have a good air cooler though
[21:07:16] <mixfix41> i have an asus maximus iv and iii
[21:07:26] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, I have my portable AC on
[21:07:27] <mixfix41> the maximus iv intel boards are quality boards i tink
[21:08:02] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: it's only 21C today and cold wind so, it can't really use it today. make no sense.
[21:08:32] <Cryowolf> I'm going to be making polycarbonate computer cases with good airflow and stuff and then sell i

[21:18:51] <theholyduck> i mean it is for some level of thicknss
[21:19:12] <theholyduck> Bco1981: anyways. my suggestion is. get access to a makerspace and make the cases out of acrylic but with a laser cutter
[21:19:22] <mixfix41> oh yeah with javascript running and the even faster hardware it really does do it you have to avoid the javascript then
[21:19:39] <theholyduck> i make a ton of stuff out of lasercut acrylic because its so extremely fast
[21:20:43] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: looks like my current ram will fit under that beast.
[21:20:49] <theholyduck> and then you avoid the risk of it cracking and exploding
[21:21:11] <theholyduck> like acrylic is pretty strong and all. its just that like trying to drill or tap or saw it is a pain and a half
[21:21:25] <theholyduck> i said Bco1981 
[21:21:28] <theholyduck> but i meant Cryowolf 
[21:21:37] <Bco1981> yeah, i kinda figured that :D
[21:22:13] <theholyduck> LTT did some videos where they have made like computer bits out of acrylic. and a) it does generally work but b) they often crack and asplode several of the prototypes/versions during assembly
[21:22:17] <theholyduck> because of how brittle acrylic can be
[21:22:35] <theholyduck> lasercutting and chemical bonding gets past all that
[21:24:12] <mixfix41> i was peering into a matlab pdf and was reading about digital image processing and the spectrum we cant see the machine can process digitally so could be wasting processing though ? in video what is electromagnetic violet spectrums maybe it doesnt apply
[21:26:34] <Sxem> one thing you cant make a pc case out of is magnets
[21:27:16] <Sxem> i wonder if they make magnet legos
[21:27:37] <mixfix41> too heavy
[21:27:45] <mixfix41> you want a good structure case but light weight at the same time
[21:27:54] <Sxem> google says yes
[21:28:09] <Sxem> magnets wd scramble electronics

[22:10:14] <Cryowolf> theholyduck, I'm going with polycarbonate though
[22:10:59] <Cryowolf> theholyduck, 3x800x1200mm is 35 euro
[22:11:05] <Cryowolf> not sure how cheap or expensive that is
[22:11:08] <Cryowolf> (in Sweden)
[22:11:22] <Cryowolf> can't compare Swedish (or any Scandinavian) costs to the US
[22:11:39] <shirafuno> thank you Bco1981 & mikau. I had my 1st jab a few weeks ago and had an over reaction to it immune wise. I'm hoping, touch wood, that the immune response is still fresh in my body and kicking the infections ass
[22:12:03] <shirafuno> Cryowolf, May I ask, what type & stage of cancer do you have?
[22:12:29] <Cryowolf> shirafuno,I don't want to talk about my cancer all the time, please stop
[22:12:38] <shirafuno> okay. Sorry to ask. 
[22:13:52] <mikau> shirafuno:I think the first jab will give you at least a letal immunity. I got mine last week.
[22:14:04] <mikau> *a little immunity. Interesting typo, though.
[22:17:30] <shirafuno> hopefully yeah. I've not done much googling as i don't want to scare myself (I have an anxiety disorder). I think i have the delta variant, which is the most widespread variant currently in the UK. Theres a debate as to if the more it mututes, the chance it can escape the vaccine. 
[22:18:55] <shirafuno> i won't debate on this much as i don't have the knowledge or credentials. right now i have a sore throat at worse. touchwood this is the worst it gets.
