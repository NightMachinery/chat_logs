[08:48:46] <feinedsquirrel> looking into customizing my own zsh prompt without relying on outside projects. I found a prompt that I am using as a base, that defines some color names at the beginning with e.g. `typeset +H my_purple="%F{92}"` When I use this alias inside my `PS1='$my_purple%n%f.....` I cannot understand if I need to "escape" its use with `%{$my_purple%}` or not.

[09:10:58] <feinedsquirrel> Ah, I see, thanks for the clarification. I had connected it incorrectly in my head. So just because I'm using an alias doesn't mean I have to use the %{...%} sequence, but if that alias needs escaped, it can happen inside, or outside of the alias. Just so happens the %F takes care of it inside. That correct?

[09:37:53] <mkoskar> feinedsquirrel: you're talking about aliases (or color declarations) yet that's just simple use of a variable, aliases are a different thing and there's nothing called color declaration, the point is that in prompt variables PS1,2,3... some special sequences are understood, zsh calls those prompt escape sequences, they are different from raw/terminal escape sequences, %F is prompt escape
[09:37:55] <mkoskar> sequence, so is %{...%}, need from latter arises from the fact that echoing raw/terminal escape sequences doesn't move the cursor and zsh needs to know about that for prompt length calculations

[12:56:31] <weltio> sheep: yes, "fs0:\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI"
[12:56:50] <sheep> that's probably the problem. the efi shell is overwriting the command line
[12:57:03] <Foxboron> err
[12:57:06] <sheep> I think
[12:57:09] <weltio> well i dont think so
[12:57:15] <Foxboron> sheep: It doesn't. The stub ignores it.
[12:57:37] <weltio> imho dracut should get the commandline that it stored during creation time
[12:57:49] <Foxboron> Stored where?
[12:58:11] <weltio> interestingley /etc/cmdline.d/ contains only 00-btrfs.conf
[12:58:42] <Foxboron> If the unified kernel image is generated in arch-chroot without writing /etc/kernel/cmdline then it uses /proc/cmdline which would be the cmdline for archiso

[13:06:13] <Foxboron> It should read both
[13:06:54] <weltio> Foxboron: yes but there is no /etc/cmdline in the mshell...
[13:07:04] <weltio> so only 00-btrfs.conf

[20:51:46] <phrik> Title: AUR (en) - arch-luks-suspend-git (at aur.archlinux.org)
[20:51:57] <MacGyver> Ah.
[20:52:04] <steerio> as unmaintained as it is, it has worked just fine until it just didn't
[20:52:20] <steerio> and I can't identify any single reason for this
[20:52:23] <MacGyver> Is it possible to make it pause?
[20:52:26] <libc> is that the luks smith package ?
[20:52:32] <MacGyver> Suspend has lots of race conditions.
[20:53:04] <MacGyver> So it might be that you're hitting one now, where it wants the journal to be frozen but it hasn't *yet*.
[20:53:44] <MacGyver> If a pause of a few seconds does allow it to finish suspending that's where to look.
[20:54:20] <MacGyver> (Similar to postponing the suspend until the screen locker has started using an inhibitor lock)

[22:42:29] <mattf> anyone interested in a weird curl problem i'm trying to figure out. Which the newest curl i got on arch i am getting blocked by cloudflare on a site, but with the exact same command, same headers and same ip on a ubuntu machine on my lan i do not. I can repeat it forever getting the same results. Ubuntu has curl 7.68 while arch is 7.81. Thing is, if I use a proxy like mitmproxy, charles, fiddler etc, which are local proxies (just making
[22:42:30] <mattf> clear this isn't an ip block problem at all) i do not get blocked anymore. 
[22:42:38] <TheDcoder> I started with Ubuntu in 2015
[22:43:27] <noobaroo> st config file is config.h, Does this mean I need to recompile the program everytime I want to change the config?
[22:43:37] <TheDcoder> mattf: I think it's a good idea to make a post on the forum consolidating all of the details
[22:43:37] <Warepire> noobaroo: Yes
[22:44:40] <mattf> then i tried to build the same version of curl from source on arch, 7.69, still got blocked. (this builds curl and libcurl statically) then i also built curl on ubuntu and it got blocked, until i built it with brotli. Even though i dont have "br" on the accept headers, seems cloudflare is testing that? but then i build old curl with same brotli version on arch and it still didn't work!

[22:59:06] <steerio> so one curl is using a proxy, the other one doesn't?
[22:59:09] <mattf> this is such a crazy thing. How can i transplant the ubuntu curl to my arch? I copy all libs ldd show for uubuntu, put then on a folder and set LD_Wahtever to that folder and run curl?
[22:59:28] <mattf> steerio: yeah when i use mitmproxy it works, not blocked
[22:59:39] <mattf> this is a proxy running on the same machine
[22:59:54] <steerio> so you have three scenarios
[22:59:55] <mattf> i just add -k --tlsv1 -x http://localhost:8080 to the curl command

[23:04:22] <mattf> yes
[23:04:29] <steerio> I have a weird idea that somehow the NAT firewall assigns different source ports to the two boxes and cloudflare cares about this somehow, idk
[23:04:42] <mattf> my ubuntu is behind my arch

[23:19:49] <grawity> well, they *are* xterm-compatible to some extent
[23:20:18] <grawity> in that they identify themselves as TERM=xterm (because that's the only non-ancient terminal systems know)

[23:21:46] *** Quits: Masterphi (~Masterphi@user/masterphi) (Quit: Masterphi)
[23:21:53] <grawity> yeah, something like that – it's a database of terminal informations, telling programs what sequences to send for a specific effect
[23:22:11] <noobaroo> grawity: what terminal do you use? 
[23:22:14] <grawity> (e.g. see `man tput`, see `infocmp -L`, etc)
[23:22:16] <TheDcoder> right... someone should make a modern standard already :P
[23:22:17] <noobaroo> You seem smart 
[23:22:32] <TheDcoder> I don't think it matters much with modern term emulators
[23:22:43] <DeepDayze> lxterminal shows as xterm-256color
[23:22:44] <grawity> for example there's a mapping for "enter italics mode", and there are mappings for key sequences (f4, home, etc) that terminals send *to* applications
[23:22:45] <TheDcoder> I just use whatever comes with my DE
[23:23:02] <grawity> and yeah that's the thing here, it "doesn't matter much" *because* they all pretend to be xterm
[23:23:09] <grawity> except for urxvt and such
[23:23:12] <TheDcoder> ah the irony :)
[23:23:18] <grawity> urxvt's key sequences differ a little
[23:23:30] <grawity> you can't just go with TERM=xterm if you're using irxvt
[23:23:31] <DeepDayze> even Konsole says it's xterm
[23:23:38] <TheDcoder> I have heard Alacritty is pretty good if you want GPU acceleration
[23:24:08] <DeepDayze> I like Terminator as a terminal but on KDE Konsole is the cats meow
[23:24:09] <grawity> the big issue is that only Linux even lets you upload custom terminfo mappings to $HOME, and even that's kind of annoying
