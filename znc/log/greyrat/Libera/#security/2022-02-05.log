[03:37:38] <zdctg[m]> well but that's a second question that's more or less unrelated-- your question is "how do i hack a linux box" and then your second question is "how do i read ICMP packets once I've hacked it?"
[03:38:32] <AceFrehley> Oh, yeah, so the technical part ... Sure
[03:38:34] <Garb0> sorry if i misrepresented, my original question was how to get your hands on an already taken box

[03:40:20] <AceFrehley> Defender trusts it all though
[03:40:36] <zdctg[m]> if you have root/the proper capabilties, you use a raw socket to collect it, pcap isn't needed at all, it just makes collection a little bit easier
[03:41:39] <Garb0> True, yes, but like i said, i only figured out a couple ways to hijack users that are allowed to have such privs in case of a misconfig,
[03:41:40] <zdctg[m]> i havent tested it, its one of the first hits in google when i searched, but this looks more or less right for both sending and receiving ICMP: https://neelquestforlearning.blogspot.com/2018/01/create-ICMP-echo-packet-and-receive-ICMP-reply-packet.html

[03:51:10] <AceFrehley> This just keeps reminding me of job interviws. They ask questions or talk about shit that's just not practical. An actual tacker isn't necessarily elite
[03:51:30] <AceFrehley> Someone can download the API for haveibeenpwned and view passwords that easily
[03:51:50] <AceFrehley> But that person might not understand ICMP packets.
[03:52:05] <AceFrehley> So, the security analysts are erudite academics. They have degrees, their certifications.
[03:52:10] <AceFrehley> Multipe interivews etc
[03:52:24] <AceFrehley> But all it takes is one dark hacker who can do one things very good and that one thing only.
[03:52:41] <Garb0> part of a pentest, you are already in the post exploitation phase, yet you are still within a very restricted environment, You create a c2 listener and a payload that uses, say, plain old http, right? then comes in the party pooper, their resident NIDS or FW and kills your guy behind the line (the payload) whenever it sends something back because it's a http/s to an unknown IP, very reasonable
[03:52:43] <Garb0> for a NIDS to do
[03:53:27] <Garb0> but what they always tend to do is overlook things such as ICMP and even DNS!

[03:54:20] <AceFrehley> The DNS in my mind is more of a general IT concept. It's just name resolution but the servers I suppose can get hijacked and there could be false validation.

[03:55:41] <Garb0> Here's a DNS example: you can, using python (which is standard on many many production machines), for instance bind a nice little connection through an innocuous client port (50000+) send a primary beacon back to the master your, local machine and Boom! insulated shell!
[03:56:14] <zdctg[m]> garb0: that's pretty common but often tunneling like that isnt used with icmp just because it tends to raise eyebrows due to it being a sorta abnormal event, depending on the IDS/firewall it may/may not work-- if you're interested in something like that you can use HTTP and pipelining, generally IDS and firewalls only listen for so many bytes of a connection so you can fill the connection with benign normal HTTP data and then send you c2
[03:56:14] <zdctg[m]> traffic after you've hit the limit-- you're not wrong or confused in this respect though, yeah that will work in some cases but you'd probably find other protocols work better
[03:56:23] *** Joins: jmdaemon (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon)
[03:56:47] <Garb0> your DNS master, your local machine, will of course be listening on port 53, from a NIDS/FW perspective this is an innocent DNS request (Although to a weird IP) but all the commands/data is encoded and carried in the query section of DNS!
[03:57:46] <zdctg[m]> garb0: if you do that, you'll probably want to make it conform to the DNS protocol, most everything will detect data that isn't a given protocol but pretends to be-- it used to be really common to use shells over HTTPS that weren't actually HTTPS for instance
[03:57:58] <zdctg[m]> but you're not wrong; to answer your question, you'll want raw sockets
[03:58:20] <Garb0> zdctg[m]: `most everything will detect data that isn't a given protocol but pretends to be`
[03:58:54] <Garb0> provably false if you do it correctly, my DNS tunneller fooled both Snort and wireshark, they all see it as valid DNS traffic
[03:59:55] <zdctg[m]> if you're conforming to the DNS protocol then yes, if you're just using port 53 then no (I'd have to look at snort's code to see how it processes DNS but generally speaking there's more to it than just port number)

[04:00:20] <Garb0> Yep, when wireshark sees something off it will scream MALFORMED DNS PACKET!!11!!
[04:01:01] <zdctg[m]> you've got the right general idea, to answer your question-- you need to access raw sockets, im trying to find a decent python implementation for you to reference
[04:01:04] <AceFrehley> How often is plain ol' HTTP even used?
[04:01:24] <Garb0> Uh, all the time, AceFrehley?
[04:01:32] <AceFrehley> Most people who don't even know what TLS is know a site is dangerous by way of the padlock.
[04:01:51] <AceFrehley> I see very few sites like that ... Maybe they're more common outside of the U.S.

[04:04:05] <Garb0> Well if anyone wants to chip in with a nice, or even alternative idea, I'll be happy to hear it
[04:06:26] <zdctg[m]> like I said, try HTTP and pipelining requests but sending a large amount of benign HTTP data first and only initiate the c2 channel later in the connection; I'd have to dig through the snort source code but I know it used to only listen to like the first 4KB of a connection.
[04:06:57] <Garb0> zdctg[m]: Snort is all about rules, if there's no rule for icmp it will let it pass
[04:07:12] <Garb0> the default rules are very sane but they overlook quite a few key things
[04:07:31] <Garb0> It's incredibly powerful if configured correctly, however, love the software, fantastic piece.
[04:07:40] <zdctg[m]> this isn't the best example, but its what i could find without digging too much-- this appears to have a class that binds a raw socket: https://www.programcreek.com/python/?code=medbenali%2FCyberScan%2FCyberScan-master%2Fscapy%2Fsupersocket.py

[15:51:24] <Klinda> is overkill buying a nas?
[15:51:40] <labrador> Klinda, what would a nas even do

[15:52:52] *** Joins: Darkcoal (~user@user/Darkcoal)
[15:53:13] <labrador> Klinda, and how would that protect you?
[15:53:33] <Klinda> I see a youtube that use it
[15:53:46] <labrador> who
[15:53:47] <Klinda> I don't know if for security or I don't know
[15:54:14] <Klinda> maybe the good stuff is that you can access it
[15:54:17] <Klinda> in all devices
[15:54:22] <labrador> yes
[15:54:24] <Klinda> that is a bad part for security
[15:54:37] <labrador> Klinda, not really if you authenticate
[15:55:07] <labrador> Like if you use say a nitrokey
[15:55:30] <Klinda> if they find the credientals, you can't do anything
[15:55:34] <labrador> To do FIDO with your NAS(assuming it supports that...),no keylogger can automate that as its challenge-response
[15:55:49] <labrador> It needs manual auth everytime
[15:56:04] <labrador> Ofc if you give the auth,then it can do anything
[15:56:45] <Klinda> if I log to my pc and have a spybot here and I log to the nas
[15:56:47] <Klinda> is a problem too
[15:57:07] <labrador> well ultimately if your machine is pwned its game over
[15:57:15] <labrador> The point is to not let that happen
[15:57:43] <Klinda> well I think if they want to do that, they do, no antivirus or something protects you
[15:58:02] <labrador> Thats before the malicious part happens
[15:58:32] <labrador> Not easy to remove a virus that injects itself into say init is it?
[15:59:12] <Klinda> you play a game like dark souls on multipalyer, there is a  remote code excution
[15:59:14] <Klinda> and it's done
[15:59:32] <labrador> yes and an anti virus generally won't help you
[15:59:37] <labrador> Rkhunter might
[15:59:41] <labrador> Just might

[16:02:56] <labrador> yes
[16:03:28] <Klinda> if they put some effort to wait me until I enter the password
[16:03:30] <Klinda> xD
[16:03:40] <Klinda> maybe they just don't do it
[16:04:33] <Klinda> if I have a nas they are more curious on what I have too..
[16:05:27] <Klinda> so yeah the best thing is to have an external hd, and use it when you need it
[16:05:34] <labrador> yes
[16:06:00] <Klinda> but if you are lazy, probably you don't have it, to upadte the files
