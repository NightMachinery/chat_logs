[02:14:04] <kuudes> hmm, what is the net of tesla and spacex re china...
[02:19:53] <ggreer> tesla in china is a luxury brand. also around half of teslas made in china are exported. I think it's because it's so much harder to start a factory in the EU
[02:20:43] <ggreer> I think the only major issue will be starlink. spacex will probably restrict starlink access in china so that china doesn't retaliate against tesla
[02:21:53] <ggreer> though with dogmatic authoritarians you never know what they'll want to ban. sometimes some really weird shit gets you in trouble. eg: winnie the pooh, the roman numeral for 11, the OK sign, etc
[02:22:07] <gwern> china starlink will definitely go through a filter
[02:22:25] <gwern> question is, what else?
[02:22:59] <ggreer> I assume all tesla camera footage in china is accessed by the PRC
[02:23:39] <gwern> yes, they have china datacenters for that onshoring
[02:23:54] <ggreer> along with vehicle location data and whatnot. there are microphones in the car and the car battery is big enough to listen without noticeable drop in battery life

[11:56:12] <linear> nick cammarata is doing it right that's for sure
[11:59:59] <PapuaHardyNet> honestly, that sasha essay? I agree with almost everything he says
[12:01:11] <PapuaHardyNet> I'll be spending a lot more time meditating this year. Let's see what happens
[12:03:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh no
[12:03:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't do it
[12:05:11] <superz> obormot finally woke up from his slumber to warn papua
[12:06:38] <PapuaHardyNet> sorry obormot, meditation really does make me feel better
[12:06:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> :(
[12:06:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> At least only do it a little
[12:07:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> "a lot more" is way too much
[12:07:28] <PapuaHardyNet> sure, I meant like 30 min a day habit, not like a retreat :P
[12:08:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's too much
[12:10:48] <PapuaHardyNet> it's not that dangerous hahah
[12:14:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's very dangerous
[12:15:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't you know what happened to Elo
[12:16:44] <PapuaHardyNet> no, who is elo?
[12:17:10] <superz> Elo did drugs, and started believe in woo.
[12:17:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> He is a LessWronger
[12:17:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> He also meditated a lot
[12:19:19] <PapuaHardyNet> well, I won't take drugs so the most dangerous outcomes won't happen
[12:19:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, meditation can break your break all by itself
[12:20:32] <PapuaHardyNet> trust me, I was miserable throughout 2021, I reread my journal. anything that makes and keeps me sane, I'm going to try it
[12:21:40] <PapuaHardyNet> if I was in a satisfying relationship maybe I wouldn't consider it
[12:21:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> :(
[12:22:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Have you tried, like, antidepressants or something
[12:24:49] <PapuaHardyNet> I did use them in 2020, was super helpful. I think I stopped because they fixed my depression, but they didn't fix things I was dealing with
[12:26:11] <PapuaHardyNet> so for example, I've become much more resilient to intrusive self-loathing thoughts. That's due to meditation, before it, anti-deps would kinda just kill the pain
[12:26:37] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm, maybe to a huge extent, meditation and anti-deps are replaceable for me
[12:31:18] <saturn2> just learn to enjoy being miserable
[12:32:25] <saturn2> anything is better than meditation
[12:33:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> You joke, but I'd rather take depression than risk it, personally
[12:33:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Horrible as depression is...

[12:37:03] <capisce> "I knew the strain I was causing in my family, but since I didn't feel anything, I couldn't feel enough empathy for them to do anything about it. I knew I used to love them, but that seemed a long time ago and there was no hope of ever feeling again."
[12:37:18] <capisce> "I once had a bounce of energy so I started planning to kill myself and the weird thing was, that I felt the happiest I had ever felt in my life. It was such a feeling of peace and joy that it would soon be over."
[12:37:52] <capisce> "Fortunately for me, my family would not tolerate me in this condition and forced to me to get out of bed and dragged me to doctors and checked me into mental health units until we found the right doctor who perscribed the right medication that worked. Turns out typical anti-depressants don't work on me because I am bipolar and was experiencing bipolar depression."

[19:33:57] <ggreer> how many kids in the US have actually died from covid? it's a rounding error. unvaccinated kids are safer than vaccinated 30 year olds. it's absurd how much people are thinking about the risk of covid and not the risk of say... a car accident on the drive to/from thanksgiving dinner
[19:34:57] <kuudes> long covid is not a serious outcome medically, but seems quite disabling from personal pov
[19:35:05] <kuudes> and the vaccine is about harmless.
[19:36:45] <kuudes> I see no reason not to vaccinate everyone willing with safe and effective vaccines
[19:37:40] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : the fact that the private sector hasn't made an app (you have your main dose(s) but not your booster, it's available at walgreens 100 meters from you and it can be administered in 5 (five) mins) to take care of this, is baffling to me.
[19:39:11] <nshepperd> if long covid subtracts a few iq points from all kids it'll be a disaster for future crime stats
[19:41:47] <gwern> but why think it'll net out differently from all the other infections our little walking petri dishes get?

[20:10:43] <ggreer> I'm fine letting people choose to get boosters but I worry that it'll soon turn into a mandate like vaccines
[20:11:04] <ggreer> yeah it does. I said that already
[20:11:21] <kuudes> https://twitter.com/PaulGlasziou/status/1477767594945900544
[20:11:35] <kuudes> does usa have a mandate for any vaccine?
[20:12:07] <kuudes> it seems in any age covid kills more than 1/100k per infection
[20:13:11] <kuudes> what source says booster gives more than 10/1M myocardia or something?
[20:15:58] <kuudes> ggreer, have you noticed omicron is spreading?
[20:16:17] <kuudes> it infects also the people who have got covid in the past
[20:16:40] <kuudes> vaccines protect against it to some extent
[20:16:49] <ggreer> the only study of younger people with boosters used a population of 6,300 teens
[20:17:20] <kuudes> it has been given to millions of them already though
[20:17:26] <ggreer> boosters? nope
[20:17:38] <kuudes> the boosters have equivalent risk profile to second dose.
[20:18:06] <pompolic> car accidents kill 1 in how many teens?
[20:18:12] <pompolic> genuine question
[20:18:21] <pompolic> need some perspective for that figure
[20:19:03] <kuudes> pompolic, I don't know how it is in usa. in finland about 200 persons per year die to traffic accidents; population is 5.5M

[20:20:26] <kuudes> basicly covid vaccines are much safer than many other vaccines used for kids
[20:21:03] <kuudes> and yes, I don't want long covid to my kids; even if just of selfish reasons such as the increased cost of living for disabled people
[20:23:46] <PapuaHardyNet> you say it as if it is a bad thing to want the best for your children
[20:24:12] <PapuaHardyNet> being selfish is not bad
[20:25:51] <PapuaHardyNet> two2thehead: you should start watching those Vaatividya lore videos for Dark souls
[20:26:05] <PapuaHardyNet> or maybe that legendary 6 hour video explaining the lore of Morrowind
[20:26:46] <kuudes> just yesterday I had a long argument with a person elsewhere in ratsphere about if a person should avoid getting vaccinated while they might have covid
[20:27:03] <kuudes> tl;dr: they should not. if they have clear symptoms such as high fever, then they should
[20:27:18] <kuudes> otherwise the main worry is that they may infect the person giving the vaccination, nothing more
[20:27:53] <kuudes> it feels people are really fearing vaccinations way too much; I guess it is the disinformation and nocebo from that
[20:28:35] <two2thehead> PapuaHardyNet, hm
[20:28:42] <PapuaHardyNet> well, it's easier to die due to inaction than to die knowing that your mistake was the direct cause of your death
[20:28:44] <two2thehead> I do watch some lore vids.
[20:29:09] <kuudes> multiple medican authorities including the institute of health and welfare of finland and rki in germany confirm that you should get vaccinated as long as you don't have an active illness that makes you need bed rest
[20:29:17] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, indeed
[20:29:37] <kuudes> but if that was the case, then the vaccination accepting authorities already would have made a big deal out of that
[20:30:04] <kuudes> instead there was this whole line of arguing "it is plausible, you can't prove it is not harmful"
[20:30:20] <kuudes> and from fellow aspiring rationalist. so people clearly are very confused and scared for some reason
[20:30:51] <pompolic> i'm guessing people never really paid attention to vaccines before
[20:30:59] <pompolic> but since covid ~everyone is transfixed on them
[20:31:05] <pompolic> and they import their broken epistemology
[20:31:37] <ggreer> well there is a lot of stupidity in institutions. eg: recovery from previous infection doesn't count as vaccinated in the US
[20:31:56] <pompolic> that too
[20:31:59] <kuudes> imo it should not count
[20:32:03] <kuudes> at least after 6 months
[20:32:21] <kuudes> here it counts, and indeed they have forbid second doses from people who have got infected
[20:33:49] <ggreer> also stupid things like not approving other vaccines in the US like astrazeneca. or refusing to approve the various rapid test kits that are popular elsewhere in the world

[20:34:10] <ggreer> so yeah I don't trust the authorities when they say the vaccines are safe. the vaccines *are* safe, but not because they say so
[20:35:54] <PapuaHardyNet> do we have canadians here?

Costello is “famous” for voicing the phrase “Merthy, merthy, have you no thister of your own” in the 1928 film Tenderloin, although there is some debate as to whether her lisp or the poor quality of sound recording (and broadcasting) technology is primarily to blame.

[22:27:28] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: it's a stupid way of saying "I think it's a good idea and I'll take responsibility for part of it"
[22:27:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like... "I will pay your bills"? Or is this a metaphor?
[22:28:17] <gwern> well, I don't think dass actually expected any consequence or anything. the author must've been seriously pissed off to confront his teacher like that
[22:28:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haha
[22:28:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a very odd figure of speech, at any rate
[22:28:41] <gwern> it was cheap talk that suddenly became very expensive
[22:28:46] <rmmh> gwern: wasn't there another case of an entirely too credulous guy that wrote a long post about how he was in a throuple and got pinned with an impossible pregnancy
[22:28:49] <gwern> dass was trying to talk like a businessman
[22:29:04] <gwern> rmmh: oh, the harvard professor? yeah, but he's just a credulous moron
[22:29:34] <rmmh> "on the construction and maintenance of a cuck shack"
[22:29:36] <gwern> rmmh: I mean, the harvard guy was because of ideology. my worry with these meditators is that it's more personality / mental disorder / effects of meditation / organization
[22:30:30] <PapuaHardyNet> so ram dass fucked his wife? just wanted to confirm that
[22:31:15] <dTal> rammed ass
[22:31:27] <pompolic> which meditators exatly? what is this book called?
[22:31:30] <PapuaHardyNet> ("does everything have to be spelled out for you papua" you bet!)

[22:33:58] <gwern> with occasional annual calendrical adjustments as necessary
[22:34:18] <gwern> to be fair apparently this Mukti was really hot and that's part of why she could pull all this grifting off
[22:35:42] <gwern> 'She began to spend more and more time with an old friend of the family who had a home in New York City, a wealthy but childless lady who proposed to adopt Mukti. Because her real parents did not know what to do with her, and their friend offered a good opportunity for their daughter, they were quick to accept the offer. 2.3.21. Cocaine Jane Unfortunately, Mukti continued to be a problem...
[22:35:48] <gwern> ...child with her adoptive parents. Her new mother divorced and remarried. Perhaps her adoptive mother, giving attention to a new husband, made Mukti feel insecure and resentful, but in any case she did not like her new stepfather, and by the time she turned eighteen she had left home. Living off a temporary allowance, Mukti became a rock band groupie and had a rock song written for her...
[22:35:54] <gwern> ...entitled Cocaine Jane.'
[22:37:14] <gwern> 'After my two-year retreat in Hawaii I left my truck with a friend to sell for me, having signed the title to make the sale easy. Mukti was a houseguest of my friend shortly after I left, and she took the opportunity to steal the signed title, sell the truck, and keep the money...From time to time I hear reports of Mukti’s trail of devastation and betrayal. She has changed her name several...
[22:37:20] <gwern> ...times, and for a while lived with a plastic surgeon who changed her appearance, but her behavior has not changed. She stole $40,000 from a lady who had befriended and helped her often; she was caught selling food stamps and has forged checks, but somehow managed to avoid jail; and I have heard several rumors that people have invested in her schemes and lost their money...Mukti represented...
[22:37:26] <gwern> ...herself as being enlightened, and indeed many people believed that she was. One of her previous husbands was a guru, with a substantial following in the United States. When Mukti came into contact with followers of that tradition, they treated her with awe. One of the techniques of this tradition was to be able to give shaktipat. Shaktipat is a psychic energy a guru can administer which...
[22:37:32] <gwern> ...has a profound effect on the recipient. Shaktipat can be administered directly by a touch, or remotely in a large room, or even in another country when the recipient is meditating. There are a variety of experiences a recipient can have, such as falling into a deep trance, sudden rapid, erratic breathing, energy sensations in the body, etc. Once Mukti touched a man (from her former...
[22:37:38] <gwern> ...husband’s organization) who was visiting us. He fell over in a brief trance and slowly recovered in a confused, blissful state. He felt that he had been cleansed and transformed by his experience, and was quite impressed by Mukti’s power.'
[22:38:02] <pompolic> isn't this just being slain in the spirit
[22:40:56] <PapuaHardyNet> getting touched by a hot woman can have that effect
[22:41:12] <PapuaHardyNet> (oh god, I just made two dirty jokes today. I need to stop)
[22:42:40] <kuudes> I guess this is the reason if psychosis is selected mildly for
[22:43:27] <pompolic> if you were to make three, would that be engaging in polyribaldry?

[23:10:06] <feepbot> <gwern> 'In this paper we present a new perspective on transfer learning with foundation models, based on the recently discovered phenomenon of neural collapse (Papyan et al., 2020). Informally, neural collapse identifies training dynamics of deep networks for standard classification tasks, where the features (the output of the penultimate layer) associated with training samples
[23:10:06] <feepbot> belonging to the same class concentrate around their class feature mean. We demonstrate that this property generalizes to new data points and new classes (e.g., the target classes), when the model is trained on a large set of classes with many samples for each class. In addition, we show that in the presence of neural collapse, training a linear classifier on top of the learned
[23:10:07] <feepbot> penultimate layer can be done using only few samples. We verify these findings both theoretically and via experiments. In particular, our results provide a compelling explanation for the empirical success of foundation models, as observed, e.g., by Tian et al. (2020); Dhillon et al. (2020)' https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15121 blessings of scale
