[01:38:34] <brianx> concordia: look at --concurrent-fragments but be aware that you might trigger youtube to block you.
[01:48:33] <brianx> what is the best way to get a list of all video IDs for a channel?  i've been trying yt-dlp -4 -s "https://www.youtube.com/c/techlinked/videos" and grepping for it.  that works but that causes a huge amount of traffic, about a megabyte for every video on the channel.
