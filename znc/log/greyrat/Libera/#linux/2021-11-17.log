[00:41:44] <n4dir> are there cases where you use the find command and still have to use xargs?
[00:42:03] <lopid> the dir is not empty
[00:42:15] <kfrench> n4dir: as opposed to what?  using find -exec ?
[00:42:47] <n4dir> yes
[00:43:13] <kfrench> xargs is good when find returns a lot of results - or when you're calling a heavy app
[00:44:29] <kfrench> n4dir: xargs -P is interesting as well
[00:44:42] <lovetruth> In the meantime I did rmdir *     :). I wanted only empty dirs anyways... :)
[00:44:46] <ayecee> xargs can also break up the argument list in more ways than find -exec can
[00:44:54] <n4dir> didn't run in such yet, but then: i neither use find nor xargs very often, xargs even less, only for deborphan

[00:47:52] <lacroix> xargs has a -0 argument, but find is not using -print0, and rmdir is not necessarily going to be able to remove whole directory trees since it's not guaranteed to start at the maximum depth first

[00:52:50] <lacroix> lovetruth: ok... then super easy.
[00:52:59] <lovetruth> So, for empty directory trees, the -print0   or   -exec    would have been the right ones

[01:03:18] <lacroix> I think you can make xargs just as robust (and inefficient) as -exec if you want to... for the most part, if you can use -print0 and xargs -0, you'll be writing good commandlines
[01:03:19] *** Joins: peterhil (~peterhil@dsl-hkibng32-54fb56-2.dhcp.inet.fi)
[01:04:15] <lacroix> the issue with -exec is it spawns a new command for every input file, so it tends to use more cpu... but it avoids the danger of passing multiple arguments through pipelines the way xargs does
[01:05:05] <xx> -exec somecommand +

[05:10:51] <gry> i dont' have a 11520x1200 display so i can't check there; what model and make is it?
[05:10:52] <mikebutash> I've fed input of a 6 year old kde bug on their old tracker for all of it, now I watch as their still dance around fixing it.
[05:11:07] <gry> if you do online payments, perhaps offer a bounty
[05:11:17] <gry> and link to it here please
[05:11:46] <mikebutash> I don't dispute the complexity probably required, and I most certainly not the developer to do so, but just like, it's missing the boat...
[05:12:08] <TJ-> I've run 6 x 1920x1200 without any noticable issues
[05:12:33] <mikebutash> with a full framebuffer compositing the display at that?

[05:14:01] <TJ-> I never had need to investigate what was happening under the hood. It was across 3 GPUs as well
[05:14:08] <mikebutash> my old 6 head amd card with amd drivers was super wonky for years, using the oss drivers from about 2011 or so on worked way better.

[05:16:49] <mikebutash> I tried cinnamon, it would destabilize eventually.  Gnome shell was always weird and unstable in general, Mate once introducing marco was weird, other desktops I never got used to enough to like and use.
[05:17:17] <mikebutash> This is an xps 15 laptop I use now, older 9560 circa 2017.

[07:38:10] <sebastorama> ghen realtime is for very specific computing... eg an embedded sensor that drives actuators on a self driving rocket. You don't possibly don't want the kernel preemptively removing that process and give cpu time to another sometimes (kinda depends on the requirement, I don't really know if people really use linux RT features, or if linux kernel is "true" RT - RT being 'real time')

[07:43:11] <Kobaz> right, leaning to runaway cpu or context switching
[07:43:14] <danieldg> sebastorama: the kernel does have a limit on RT execution by default these days
[07:43:34] <sebastorama> I don know how this translate nowadays with multicore cpus.. when I experimented with it, on grad school.. cpu was singlecore.. so you could lock everything :P
[07:43:39] *** varioust_ is now known as varioust
[07:43:40] <danieldg> so it'll only let it run 950ms/second or such to avoid freezing the system
[07:43:45] <Kobaz> basically... back in the day when i did play with realtime priority, one false move and you needed to reboot
[07:43:46] <[[R]]> sebastorama: a real time task generally runs until it needs something, like io or a lock or mutex or somethign
[07:43:57] <danieldg> sebastorama: yeah, that's before that fix went in :)
[07:44:17] <sebastorama> ohh.. that's cool to know :) IRC is really nice as always <3

[07:44:53] <Kobaz> speaking of RT... -rt kernels are not good at all for high throughput loads

[08:21:49] <n4dir> ghen: what exactly would be your workflow for what you call a midi-editor?
[08:21:53] <ghen> that looks very simple, which i think is great
[08:22:32] <n4dir> if you say fruity-loops, then probably the answer will be ardour or lmms, but there are many (having said that i am not to good with the terms)

[08:36:13] <n4dir> ghen: ah, good then. You know you can install ubuntustudio metapackage then? You probably don't want that, just you know.
[08:36:51] <n4dir> also you might ask in their IRC channel for a recommendation for midi (i think you want a sequencer, but perhaps it is called editor, i am not sure)
[08:37:44] <ghen> critr, i've never edited using music notation, just piano-roll, but i can read music
[08:38:02] <n4dir> to me seq24 was good. It didn't took me to long to get the head in it, and i could create little sequences to fool with zynaddsubfx and hydrogen and the like. I am not sure if it is still comfortable for more complex stuff, i doubt it
[08:38:27] <ghen> n4dir, ya i think a sequencer would be the right term but not totally sure

[11:17:23] <blahboybaz> I'm a little curious about something... I was intending to install Tails OS on that usb stick... I wonder if I could format it as ext 4 and have everything work fine. Afaict I don't personally need it to interact with windoze ever, and it might enhance security a bit by eliminating windoze systems from accessing it natively... just if there is some part of normal operation I don't know about that might
[11:17:29] <blahboybaz> require it to be a fat partition. Any thoughts?

[12:51:04] <oerheks> there are even github pages with tools to remove thos tags/trace stuff :-D
[12:51:15] <DLange> no idea, I don't use KDE. May be there is a setting for a preferred format.
[12:51:30] <OnkelBlade> Nah, I skimmed through all its settings
[12:51:43] <DLange> so don't use the clipboard manager then
[12:51:51] <OnkelBlade> Is there a low-level system cli tool for viewing the contents of the clipboard?

[19:21:41] <ayecee> rendar: did you instal linux-headers? that should have also installed linux-headers-5.whatever for your current kernel.
[19:22:23] <rendar> ayecee, nope because someone on #debian told me that i wouldn't need that package since the dkms package would have installed headers by itself, since it has that headers package as a dependency
[19:22:34] <rendar> which is kind of true, or not?
[19:22:37] <ayecee> rendar: well, is that package installed?

[19:46:37] <mago> I tired that to doing a serial port passthrough, but is either usb or serial cant do both..
[19:46:48] <mago> And i didnt need to do the serial passthrough for the arduino..
[19:46:55] <ayecee> yeah, doing it as serial wouldn't make sense, that's not what the software is expecting
[19:47:06] <ayecee> should be a usb passthrough, and the guest may need drivres for it
[19:47:42] <mago> The guest sees the usb, but not the software thats what im at..
[19:48:05] <ayecee> right, and that may be because the guest doesn't have the driver for it, is what i'm thinking

[21:11:53] <WickedDekciw> Hello, folks. Quick qs, is it possible to somehow resize a casper-rw file (thus convert it to a partition) through a live USB installation without having another USB yet again for this task? The persistent storage partition usually present when booting from a Live USB. I'd like to increase its size, which is obviously not possible if said live USB is currently running to begin with. I do have another USB drive but I don't have the Luxury of
[21:11:54] <WickedDekciw> installing Linux twice. Can I somehow copy the live usb to the other one and then increase the partition's size from there and copy it back simultaneously?
[21:11:57] <blackgatonegro> No, I am not joking.

[22:48:16] <hexnewbie> WickedDekciw: I also don't understand the question, but installing Ubuntu on the USB, or using Ventoy seem to be partial solutions to two possible interpretations
[22:49:22] <hexnewbie> Particularly, installing Ubuntu on a partition after the first one seems to satisfy both interpretations

[22:51:05] *** Joins: Rain42 (~Rain@li958-238.members.linode.com)
[22:51:08] <WickedDekciw> msiism, I currently have an Ubuntu live USB (i.e a Live install on a USB flash drive) installation. Within it, there is a partition for storing persistent changes upon reboot. That partition however is limited in size. I'd like to increase the size of said partition to fit the whole empty space available to the USB drive in question. I can't do that while the USB drive itself is running for obvious reasons, so instead I have resorted to another
[22:51:08] <WickedDekciw> matter. I'd like to copy said live USB onto a larger partition from yet another drive, and occupy the persistent storage space to be larger, as large as the empty space in said partition.
[22:51:54] <WickedDekciw> So I'm asking as to how to do said action.

[23:36:03] <TheGuestMovie> it doesnt have an accompanying .vbox file, just vdi?
[23:36:05] <hexnewbie> With sysvinit, there were a handful that did wait for extended periods of time, like mysql, the rest delivered a TERM signal, and if the service didn't stop the final TERM, sleep, KILL took care of it. Nowadays, KDE and GNOME processes don't exit when you send TERM, so systemd sits there for 2 minutes, then decides to sit for 4
[23:36:19] <faLUKE> it is inside a zip archive, so I can't see the file type while downloading

[23:37:01] <TheGuestMovie> ok, should have both hopefully. If not, then here's what you do: put the .vdi in a dedicated directory, then in VBox, create a new VM, at the disk option pick "Use existing disk" and point it to the vdi

[23:37:49] <TheGuestMovie> I guess it makes sense to just provide the disk with no .vbox (this way the creator picks how much RAM to give it, how many processors, etc), but it's not newbie-friendly
[23:38:00] <faLUKE> TheGuestMovie: I don't understand too if I have to complete a setup with that vdi image (I don't want to run into the previous loop)

[23:38:53] <TheGuestMovie> the vbox file is just a tiny XML (text) file that contains info about the VM, like name, location, how much RAM, how many CPUs, etc. The actual installation will be inside the .vdi.
[23:39:17] <TheGuestMovie> so for example on your strong PC you might create a VM with 16GB RAM, but on my crappy laptop I would create a VM  with 2GB RAM. Even if we use the same disk.
[23:39:46] <TheGuestMovie> make sense?

[23:40:09] <faLUKE> TheGuestMovie: I see, but I don't understand if the vdi contains an image that needs to deployed or is it ready to boot and access the desktop

[23:42:25] <TheGuestMovie> faLUKE: the vdi is the hard drive of the VM. But a VM also has non-fixed configuration related to it like I mentioned (name, RAM, CPU, MAC address). Those are done in a separate text file. You can create that text file in 15 seconds in the VBox menu

[23:43:42] <WickedDekciw> msiism, Well, did you figure out anything since? You interestingly mentioned the possibility of modifying the partition live
[23:44:01] <jason1234> what about that you rewrite systemd and make it better? there is xmalloc for careless developers. Systemd is a work of amateur in C languge. Any plans to clean up that mess from most linux distros?
[23:44:10] <msiism> WickedDekciw: Yeah, well, is this the last partition on the device?
[23:44:22] <keir> jason1234: can you not start this again...
[23:44:40] <jason1234> xmalloc would be a bit better for this
[23:44:41] <faLUKE> TheGuestMovie: I mean something different. During the install process with issues that I described before, the vdi was already created, but the install was not finished. Then I wonder if this vdi needs to compplete the installation or if it is ready to boot to a working Windows
[23:44:54] <msiism> p-i-: Are you sure, `echo '{"foo":42}` is exactly as it should be? I mean, to me, this looks like a missing single quote at the end.
