[23:19:49] <dig-dug> stareye: deliverability: (#1) If you're having problems getting your mail received by major ESPs you should first check your !fcrdns, then make sure you have SPF, DKIM and DMARC configured (see !easy_dmarc). Sign up for the dnswl at http://www.dnswl.org. Also sign up for ESP-specific programs such as feedback loops, Google postmaster tools and Microsoft's SNDS., or (#2) Check the individual postmaster pages for each ESP
[23:19:50] <dig-dug> stareye: that you're having problems with to make sure that you're in compliance with all of their policies and if you still have problems contact the support for the ESP., or (#3) Also check to make sure you're not on any DNSRBLs and submit removal requests from any you appear on. See !multirbl.
[23:26:49] <Khepra> stareye: also, I wouldn't care much about UCEPROTECT unless you're on level 1
[23:27:42] <stareye> Khepra: i am at level 2 and 3
[23:28:07] <Khepra> stareye: then there's nothing you can do except: complain to your provider; move to another subnet; do nothing. 
[23:28:49] <Khepra> nobody should be using uceprotect anyway: https://blog.sucuri.net/2021/02/uceprotect-when-rbls-go-bad.html
[23:30:02] <stareye> Khepra: yes i wanted to make a phone call to my provider tomorrow
[23:30:06] <Khepra> I migrated some servers recently and got into a level 2 listed subnet. my final answer for 32k€ was: c) do nothing.
[23:30:48] <stareye> :O
[23:30:49] <lunaphyte> i love how that random blog author has invented that since he doesn't want to have to wait, someone else is being unethical
[23:31:42] <Khepra> I believe the unethical part comes mostly from the "Cartooney" thing that's borderline legal in EU at least.
[23:33:00] <lunaphyte> two wrongs don't make a right, i imagine we could agree there
[23:33:49] <lunaphyte> however, garbage behavior met with a proportional response is not always black and white to be categorized as two wrongs
[23:35:38] <lunaphyte> ironically, the amount of abuse that reputation system operators put up with is enormous, and relentless
[23:35:59] <Khepra> "yes, but"  :)
[23:36:44] <lunaphyte> so if i were marc, i'd give that some serious though before declaring that because a dnsbl is operated in some manner other than he would like, they are loathsome
[23:36:49] <lunaphyte> *serious thought

[23:38:19] <lunaphyte> his claims are as questionable as he accuses their behaviors of being
[23:38:49] <Khepra> ordinarily, I'd argue with you now, but I've recently resigned in that email business is basically dead for anyone but the biggest players; so if anyone complains, I just direct them to o365 or gsuite. can oyu believe I didn't even write a support ticket to Hetzner to alert them about listed /24? yeah. :)
[23:40:01] <lunaphyte> perhaps it's time for a change of scenery for you
[23:40:26] <Khepra> yes, that it is.
