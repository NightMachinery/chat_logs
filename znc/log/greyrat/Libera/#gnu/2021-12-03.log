[01:11:59] <bill-auger> jason1234: the kernel was seen as a relatively low importance/urgency component of the system - they saved it for last - that is when linus came in with a working compatible kernel

[01:24:09] <bill-auger> that is another lost point of netiquette - originally, no one needed to mention that - it was common knowledge that you very most likely do not want to click any links in any chat
[01:24:56] <jason1234> we had freebsd on top of debian. before, that idea was cool. linux just came at right time.
[01:25:11] <bill-auger> even if the computer could handle it without freezing, it was still a very bad idea

[07:19:03] <M6piz7wk[m]> Is there a way for people to start their own gnu project? Or is it just gnu outsourcing the subsidiary or something?
[07:23:38] <anton> what
[07:23:58] <anton> what do you mean?
[07:27:05] <anton> anyone can make free software if that's what you're asking
[07:27:22] <anton> also what "subsidiary" is being "outsourced"?
[07:27:26] <M6piz7wk[m]> like GNU Guix it's apparently under GNU but not really managed by gnu?
[07:27:42] <M6piz7wk[m]> or is it like project made by GNU?

[15:02:20] <bill-auger> nothing that you describe would affect licensing though - the choice of license is arbitrary for any of the co-operating parts
[15:02:54] <akspecs> maybe i can try to paraphrase
[15:03:54] <akspecs> i would like the site i'm building which is essentially a web based user interface for users to interact with a bunch of data that i scrape with some frequency
[15:04:12] <akspecs> to be licensed agpl
[15:04:45] <akspecs> as i think it would be a good thing if others were to take the code, improve it, and host their own instances (if the project ever takes off)

[15:05:05] <bill-auger> ok sounds good
[15:05:13] *** Joins: Xylon (~xylon@mail.xylon.me.uk)
[15:05:28] <bill-auger> what is the  problem, conflict, confusion?
[15:05:40] <akspecs> but the code which is used to scrape the data to build that database is hosted in another repo -- and i'm unsure if a gpl license makes sense here
[15:06:04] <bill-auger> the GPL makes sense anytjime you want copyleft
[15:06:39] <bill-auger> why would you suppose that the GPL may not be appropriate, for any program?
[15:06:49] <akspecs> which i am supportive of
[15:07:56] <bill-auger> IMHO, the only scenario where the GPL is not appropriate, is when the program is so small, its not worth copyrighting
[15:08:06] <bill-auger> but even then, it wouldnt hurt
[15:10:03] <akspecs> it wouldn't violate the agpl if the site is released under that license, but the database it connects is generated by code under some other license?

[15:17:42] <bill-auger> likewise, the network communication on the wire probably has no license, and needs none - it too is only data at that point
[15:18:28] <bill-auger> its just another of the program's inputs/outputs
[15:18:54] <bill-auger> its not part of "the program", or covered by the program's license
[15:20:35] <bill-auger> if it were, then it would not be permissible to use GCC to compile non-free programs

[15:31:20] <bill-auger> frankly though, from that description, id say that your more severe licensing issue, is the fact that your are scraping data from other's people's websites - that data may not be licensed for you to copy - if it is a commercial website, it almost surely is not permitted

[15:36:34] <akspecs> there is a gray area here indeed in other examples of this

[15:37:58] <bill-auger> i think you would see much less grey, if it was your data being harvested, to feed someone else's website
[15:38:35] <akspecs> the sites the data is harvested are creative commons or something similar along those lines
