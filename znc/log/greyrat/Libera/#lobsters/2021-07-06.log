[00:27:44] <mockturtle> [ Latest patches show Rust for Linux project making great strides towards the kernel ] - www.theregister.com
[00:28:36] <bakedpi> The last paragraph mentions about big endian in networking. Can someone guide me to any reference for it?
[00:29:20] <bakedpi> In the latest patches, Ojeda proposed to use big-endian order for long symbols in the kernel symbol table, needed because Rust symbols "can become quite long due to namespacing introduced by modules, types, traits, generics." Torvalds responded: "Why is this in big-endian order? Let's just try to kill big-endian data, it's disgusting and should just die already... networking has legacy reasons from the bad old days when byte order wars were still a thing,
[00:29:22] <bakedpi> but those days are gone."

[00:46:21] <bakedpi> Yup. I wasn't clear about that. They specifically mentioned networking so I thought some protocol may be big endian.
[00:47:12] <badtuple> I assume he just meant it kept creeping into places instead of allowing people to standardize as much as possible. I can't imagine he thinks it's disgusting intrinsically and in-isolation? Not Linus tho.
[00:48:13] <epilys> abstract things can be disgusting. it's a form of synesthesia

[17:47:36] <steenuil> speaking of OO, we're doing this project in Rust at work and one of the guys on the team was tasked to implement a state machine
[17:47:38] <jmcirl> speaking of css - anyone using Tailwind in production or at home ?
[17:47:50] <c355e3b> I'm 50/50 on it
[17:48:04] <steenuil> and being the only guy on the team who actually knows the language, I'm the one they call when the compiler yells at them
[17:48:06] <jmcirl> @steenuil we literally posted at the exact same time with the same opening words..
[17:48:13] <jmcirl> :D
[17:48:19] <steenuil> lol yeah
[17:48:51] <jmcirl> @c355e3b - what are you 50/50 on - Tailwind?
[17:49:52] <steenuil> anyway, the guy used a state machine library with does it right, it uses some macro magic to ensure the state transitions are well typed etc

[17:50:51] <companion_cube> State machine should just be a sum type and transition function? :/
[17:50:55] <rwb> steenuil: yeah we're using useSelector
[17:51:09] <companion_cube> Or functions
[17:51:31] <rwb> it's just that component A uses useSelector to pick up something, passes it to component B, component B passes it to component C and component C uses it
[17:51:57] <steenuil> rwb, could make for easier testing I guess?
[17:52:05] <jmcirl> cant you just wire it up directly a la angular?
[17:52:12] <steenuil> yeah you can

[17:55:48] <rwb> modifying redux state on click within the sidebar component
[17:56:26] <jmcirl> rwb - correct me if i am wrong, but it shouldnt matter where you modify it from as its just a central store
[17:56:38] <rwb> yeah, but it's terrible style
[17:56:50] <rwb> the sidebar should accept an onCloseClick prop which the layout passes to it
[17:57:45] <steenuil> UI state in redux is just bad style in general
[17:57:56] <steenuil> unless it's something really global
[17:58:09] <rwb> it's not :^(
[17:58:20] <steenuil> fite me :(
[17:58:28] <rwb> as in
[17:58:31] <rwb> it's not global state
[17:58:33] <rwb> it's just a sidebar
[17:58:42] <rwb> for some unknown reason it was put in global state
[17:58:43] <steenuil> oh

[17:59:10] <rwb> i've been cleaning various messes in the codebase since the start of the week

[18:04:14] <jmcirl> rwb maybe the better question is to first ask steenuil how much experience he has with react
[18:04:26] <jmcirl> rwb how much experience do you have with react?
[18:04:41] <rwb> err, a couple years i think
[18:04:53] <rwb> i prefer html templates, but if the job wants it, i use react
[18:05:04] <steenuil> I've used it for 3-4 years I think
[18:05:26] <jmcirl> yeah this is the thing. redux is a common architecture pattern used in react apps. if you're going to fight it, you may end up creating an even bigger mess than intended
[18:06:00] <steenuil> I've seen lots of messes that did use redux
[18:06:29] <rwb> useState isn't really useful for anything other than trickle-down state
[18:06:38] <rwb> since react components can't make changes to their parents
[18:06:41] <jmcirl> yes so have i. but i have seen some very very elegant code using state stores also. i think the trick it to largely get the design correct up front and copy paste the sh!t out of it.
[18:07:11] <rwb> because redux is just "here are some objects, write literally everything lol", it can go awry very quickly
[18:07:17] <jmcirl> but, rwb, the problem you describe is "trickle down"
[18:07:24] <rwb> i'm glad that @reduxjs/toolkit and the style guide exist
[18:07:24] <jmcirl> [15:21] <rwb> it's just that component A uses useSelector to pick up something, passes it to component B, component B passes it to component C and component C uses it
[18:07:34] <rwb> yes, that's what the previous programmer did
[18:07:40] <rwb> i didn't start this project
[18:08:04] <rwb> ideally component C would do useSelector and use the state directly
[18:08:10] <rwb> provided it's not a generic component
[18:08:46] <steenuil> rwb, I think most state is trickle down state
[18:08:50] <rwb> indeed
[18:09:02] <rwb> stuff like the user's cart and account details are usually store state though
[18:09:13] <rwb> which is what this app is using it for
[18:09:14] <steenuil> yeah that makes sense to put into redux
[18:09:20] <rwb> but then it does the aforementioned weird things like UI state
[18:09:57] <steenuil> I guess it depends on what kind of app you're writing

[18:21:11] <pushcx> better to ban users - if you just delete the record from the user table, any other data (stories, comments, votes) from that user will still be pointing at it, the site will surely throw lots of 500s
[18:22:04] <c355e3b> I'm having one of those "write my own CI system" days

[18:26:24] <phretor> epilys I actually *deleted* that user, and then tried to have another user take their username. I could not: the system complained that the username was already taken.

[21:45:58] <sam1> Yeah, I kind of noticed something that I didn't like at all and would like to confirm if others experience it.
[21:46:16] <technomancy> VPNs are just SSH for suits
[21:46:29] <sam1> Sure
[21:47:31] <sam1> NordVPN inserts -j ACCEPT for their gw ip on my INPUT chain for filter table without any conditions on the state of the connection.
[21:48:00] <sam1> While it works perfectly fine (no shit) with -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED added to it.
[21:48:44] <sam1> Only reason I could think of they want to inject such a relaxed rule is for them to have access to the machine
[21:49:13] <sam1> I ended up writing a quick bash script to replace such rules with a more restrictive one, not very graceful tbh, but it does the job for now. I've asked them why they do this as well.

[23:15:36] <kiedtl> daegalus: sort of. But I don't really need to keep a lot of stuff in sync, so I haven't touched sshfs (but it's likely I'll have to sometime soon). Instead, whatever I need to keep in sync is usually public stuff stored in a Git repo on GH/srht.
[23:15:50] <kiedtl> So it's a simple `git pull` to sync stuff for me.
[23:18:37] <daegalus> I already use mosh, thats not the issue. More about maintaining multiple computers and their installations, disparities in installations, etc. Especially on Windows. I'ts not like if I install X on my laptop, it will magically get install on Y.

[23:20:20] <daegalus> it does, ive used that, but doesnt work well when you need to do Unity game dev, or something graphical.
[23:21:00] <technomancy> I've run my browser over SSH before. it can work if your local network is fast enough.
[23:21:13] <technomancy> but it probably wouldn't work for programs that need the GPU
[23:21:43] <daegalus> Maybe, but wifi throws a wrench into that.
[23:22:19] <technomancy> yeah, anyway I can strongly recommend it for development that runs inside tmux and not so much otherwise
[23:22:24] <daegalus> didnt take into account gaming though. so the VM/Thin-client setup wont work. Guess I need to figure out how to keep all my computers in sync with software and settings.
[23:22:59] <daegalus> Mostly keeping WSL in sync too. so its like keeping 6 computers in sync
[23:23:50] <ngoldbaum> emacs -nw 4 life
[23:23:59] <ngoldbaum> emacs -nw is best emacs
[23:24:17] <ngoldbaum> (except for things that are broken in emacs -nw, which is some stuff)
[23:24:19] <technomancy> I'd agree except for the fact that exwm exists
[23:24:27] <technomancy> never going back to The Before Days
[23:24:43] <daegalus> you know, I genuinely tried to get emacs setup, and i got lost in plugin installation hell. Plugins werent showing up. took me 3 horus just to find that for some reason the default installation doesn't have the primary plugin repo everyone uses setup correctly.
[23:25:01] <ngoldbaum> lol yes
[23:25:04] <c355e3b> you can use emacs without plugins
[23:25:04] <technomancy> that's because the one everyone uses is bananas
[23:25:06] <ngoldbaum> gnu
[23:25:06] <c355e3b> I do every day
[23:25:24] <technomancy> it pulled packages from a publicly editable wiki for like four years and allowed packages to be downloaded without TLS
[23:25:30] <daegalus> but at that point, i would just use nano if its emacs without plugins
[23:25:32] <technomancy> just like ... npm-level broken
[23:25:42] <ngoldbaum> also there are patches to support macos better that you need to use a third-party fork to get
[23:25:55] <daegalus> well, glad i dont use OSX
[23:25:57] <ngoldbaum> because gnu emacs won’t apply patches that don’t work on darwin or some bs
[23:26:46] <daegalus> maybe i need to finagle some kind of Active directory server that i can sync everything to for windows, to keep settings and software in sync.

[23:29:03] <lkhrs> It's very good

[23:35:31] <daegalus> im already syncing zsh and dotfiles with git
[23:35:31] <daegalus> and a custom bash script that installs most of the stuff, but i have to manually keep up to date
[23:35:55] <manicennui> daegalus: Welcome to the dotfiles rabbit hole.
[23:37:03] <daegalus> i feel like there is a gap in multi-device productivity that hasnt really be easily solved, unless you forgo graphical user interfaces and stick to cli tools.
[23:37:06] <daegalus> and dont play games or use apps.
[23:37:26] <technomancy> "use apps" <- what does that even mean
[23:37:26] <manicennui> Half the problem is that configuration on Linux is a mess.
[23:37:36] <manicennui> The other half is that package management is a mess.

[23:41:14] <mockturtle> [ XDG Base Directory - ArchWiki ] - wiki.archlinux.org
[23:41:25] <manicennui> And right now most things just create their own directory right in your home directory.
[23:41:30] <daegalus> and for games, its mostly installing them and keeping them updated on multiple computers, like MMOs and giant multi-gig patches that take forever to download and install.
[23:41:44] <manicennui> As well as read any number of shared config files.
[23:41:59] <manicennui> daegalus: That problem seems to be mostly solved by Steam IMHO.
[23:42:04] <daegalus> hmmm, loooks like it might be the relay, I have message history when I refresh the client. (glowing bear in this case)
[23:42:44] <manicennui> If you mean having to download the same patch multiple times, I don't know what to tell you.
[23:42:50] <manicennui> I don't tend to install large games on multiple machines.
[23:43:07] <manicennui> Didn't Apple have a way to only download large updates once for multiple local machines?
[23:43:54] <daegalus> ya, but that would require me to buy FFXIV and all expacs on Steam.... again. WoW isnt on their either, and they only let you have 1 computer logged into the blizzard app at a time. Ashes launcher doesnt auto-update, etc. MMOs just dont care usually.

[23:46:04] <daegalus> yup, laptop and desktop. Mostly because I like gaming on the couch with the wife from time to time, or others sitting at the ultrawide screen and gaming there. Mostly to take advantage of the threadripper
[23:46:29] <daegalus> Not to mention i am getting into ML and AI and the GPUs help
[23:47:07] <daegalus> I mean, it all boils down to I really should converge on 1 device and not have this issue. But they dont make mobile threadrippers
[23:47:35] <manicennui> Energy usage/heat production is a bit ridiculous.
[23:48:11] *** Quits: jmw (~jmw@user/jmw) (Quit: jmw)
[23:48:21] <daegalus> if I could offload GPU/CPU work onto the threadrippers for heavy workloads from the laptop and just use the desktop as compute resources, I would. I just havent even considered how I would set that up or if most apps can even offload to remote workers.
[23:48:51] <daegalus> Not really, I have the threadripper desktop sleeping/hibernating most of the time and only wake it up for actual use.
[23:49:20] <manicennui> Sure, but to actually take advantage of the CPU, you aren't going to be able to cram it into a laptop.
[23:49:36] <manicennui> It isn't even clear to me that you can run threadrippers at full throttle with the cooling solutions that most people have.
[23:49:54] <manicennui> Which seems to make their entire use case questionable.
[23:50:02] <daegalus> mine is liquid cooled, but yes i understand why a mobile threadripper doesnt exist, im just saying thats why i have 2 computers.
[23:50:32] <ngoldbaum> gaming laptops aren’t worth the extra cost
[23:50:40] <manicennui> I started looking into building a thread ripper machine, and there seem to be a lot of caveats to running them at full throttle.
[23:50:45] <daegalus> and i always hated managing 2 computers. let alone 3 (work computer is separately managed and doesn't sync with anything)
[23:51:18] <manicennui> The most obvious workloads for thread rippers seem to be multi-hour max throttle runs.
[23:51:30] <daegalus> ngoldbaum: agreed, but i have a use for it and it makes the wife happy when we can game on the couch together in the evenings while watching TV.
[23:51:34] <manicennui> But it doesn't seem like even basic water cooling is enough for that.
[23:52:00] <manicennui> All of the recommended setups seem optimized for short bursts.
[23:52:02] <daegalus> and I tried the Parsec/Remtoe Gaming setups, my wifi network cant handle it atm. I used to have a non-gaming laptop and just the threadripper. Didn't work out too well
[23:53:09] <daegalus> honestly, I just like that i can game, encode, run some other process in teh backgorund, etc all at the same time. I have multiple workloads like that. I have also been thinking of getting a VM system like Unraid or Proxmox (or whatever it was called) and partitioning the desktop into smaller vms.
[23:53:23] <manicennui> daegalus: I can do that on my 5 year old machine though.
[23:53:53] <daegalus> then use it for linux, cross-compiling, nas, etc.
[23:54:55] <daegalus> i just need a 2nd vid card for it.
[23:55:57] <daegalus> anyways, i plan to downsize at some point, if I can get a setup that works well for me. I also have 2-3 old laptops and some RPis running as linux servers and a k8s cluster for personal projects, hosting some of my own stuff, and experimentation.
[23:56:19] <manicennui> I want to build some kind of Ryzen system, but I don't have a good reason to.
