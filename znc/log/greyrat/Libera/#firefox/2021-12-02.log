[09:59:11] <MJCDzZz> do what
[09:59:20] *** MJCDzZz is now known as MJCD
[10:00:22] <dragestil> MJCD: that allows you to add keybinding to the execution of js code of your choosing

[10:01:11] <MJCD> so like a macro engine for the current page?
[10:01:27] <dragestil> I don't know what is a macro engine for the current page
[10:01:45] <MJCD> you don't know what a keyboard macro is?
[10:02:14] <MJCD> like ctrl+alt+delete is a keyboard macro
[10:02:37] <MJCD> but you want one that you can give your own js that runs on the page do to <something>?
[10:02:49] <MJCD> or you want it to run at the extension level?
[10:02:56] <MJCD> to do <something>
[10:03:12] *** Joins: ede (~ede@user/ede)
[10:03:59] <dragestil> I just want to bind execution of certain js code to some key. my specific usecase is to bind key to a bookmarklet
[10:04:15] <dragestil> which executes a js on the current page
[10:05:08] <dragestil> effectively i think it is equivalent to running code in a web console
[10:05:57] <dragestil> as a toy example, let's say I want to bind ctrl+alt+c to console.log("hello")
[10:06:07] <dragestil> is there a simple way to achieve it?
[10:06:36] <MJCD> lol wow people don't know what macros are
[10:06:39] <MJCD> that astonishes me
[10:07:19] <MJCD> dragestil: just use autohotkey or similar
[10:07:24] <MJCD> do it at the system level
[10:07:35] <MJCD> you definitely could make such a thing
[10:07:39] <MJCD> but no, it doesn't exist
[10:07:48] <MJCD> it's also pretty far removed from what your question was
[10:07:58] <MJCD> i'd recommend reading xyproblem.info

[10:25:14] <dragestil> wow, a 21 year old bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57805
[10:25:38] <xx> there are older bugs than that not getting fixed, making people switch to other browsers
[10:27:11] <MJCD> dragestil: it has no place on the web and isn't a bug it's a feature request
[10:27:14] <MJCD> two totally different things
[10:27:38] <dragestil> xx: well, there are not really other options except "text based" browsers
[10:27:43] <MJCD> "you mean it doesn't do this random thing that should be system level because that's where it belongs?!"
[10:27:46] <MJCD> shocker
[10:27:58] <MJCD> i'm outraged
[10:28:09] <xx> dragestil: choose my option - consider the web a mistake and stop using it
[10:28:16] <dragestil> xx: lol
[10:28:21] <xx> i'm serious
[10:28:31] <MJCD> you're dumb.
[10:28:35] <xx> internet should never have been made available to the masses
[10:28:42] <xx> especially without having to pass some test
[10:28:47] <MJCD> you shouldn't have been made available to irc.

[10:43:10] <MJCD> or can

[10:43:54] <MJCD> there's thousands of macros on their site for firefox
[10:43:55] <W> as a developer, I have an instinctive aversion to globals

[10:44:30] <W> collisions specifically is a worse problem at the system level

[10:48:37] <W> hmm yeah I guess userscripts would be my go-to, but I expect there'd be trouble with various webpages doing their own things with keyboard input
[10:48:47] <MJCD> but in the end of the day with an extension you can do whatever you want if you create it

[10:49:45] <W> dragestil, I'm thinking e.g. games in the browser
[10:49:57] <dragestil> W: ah I see
[10:50:02] <MJCD> even facebook has keyboard shortcuts
[10:50:05] <MJCD> for accessibility
[10:50:20] <W> now accessibility should definitely be system level :p
[10:50:30] <MJCD> they're functionality specific
[10:50:34] <MJCD> and aria-complete

[11:01:27] <W> being right also doesn't mean being tolerable :p

[11:54:58] <byteskeptical> just wanted to follow up with a solution for those that come later. I asked about a shortcut for pinning tabs and while that doesn't seem to exist you can use the tab key to highlightor focus  a tab and then shift + f10 to bring up the context menu where a P will get the job done
