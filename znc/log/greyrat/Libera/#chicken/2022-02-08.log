[02:25:01] <siiky> heyall o/ I gave it a go but I'm missing a piece... How to make my own procedures available at compile time to use in macro definitions? I know about import-for-syntax, but that would require I defined the procedures in another module I think? sounds overkill... someone please enlighten me!
[02:26:38] <siiky> oh just noticed that I forgot to inject the `name` variable... though that's not the error the compiler complains about
[02:30:42] <vandusen> "siiky" pasted "second go at procedural macros" http://paste.call-cc.org/paste?id=2a0355cf33baeadf9f27f179f3930c942a94e4e5#a1
[02:41:34] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[02:46:13] <Bunny351> you can simply include the make-name procedure in the macro body
[02:47:30] *** Joins: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata)
[02:47:32] <Bunny351> but I guess you are using for a general solution...
[02:48:16] <siiky> oh that's neat
[02:49:04] <siiky> yeah, the macro will be used many times to define procedures in a module; does that make a difference?
[02:49:18] <siiky> that procedure is only used for that macro, nothing else
[02:50:10] <Bunny351> then move the definition into the macro - it will exist just once in the transformer code, not in the expansion.
[02:54:28] <siiky> neat, it compiles now!
[02:54:54] <siiky> but looks like defmeth didnt define a procedure hmm...
[02:57:20] <vandusen> "siiky" pasted "third go at procedural macros" http://paste.call-cc.org/paste?id=2a0355cf33baeadf9f27f179f3930c942a94e4e5#a2
[02:59:21] <siiky> ah the procedure is not named a/b/c but a114/b115/c116 instead lol now to get out of this pickle
[03:01:40] <Bunny351> also ensure that the parts of "components" are not implicitly renamed (strip-syntax may work, but I don't klnow anything about the procedural-macros egg)
[03:02:46] <siiky> yeah, that's what I was thinking about, how to unrename the elements of the components list
[03:04:12] <siiky> !!!!
[03:04:22] <siiky> (map strip-syntax components)  just worked
[03:04:41] <siiky> the procedure is now defined with the right name!
[03:04:44] <siiky> thanks Bunny351 !
[03:06:23] <jcroisant> Hooray! \o/
[03:10:04] <Bunny351> well, strip-syntax is a bit of a hack
[03:10:30] <Bunny351> but if it works for you, all is well
[03:13:04] <siiky> how much is a bit?
[03:15:52] <Zipheir> 1/1000 of a kilobit.
[03:19:38] <siiky> I thought of a similarly bad joke :)

[13:17:35] <s-liao> Hello
[13:18:13] <s-liao> What is eval (##sys#current-environment) in REPL?
[13:20:09] <s-liao> It is fine to run (##sys#current-environment) in REPL, but when ,m r4rs-null, run (##sys#current-environment)  in REPL again.
[13:20:56] <s-liao> The output are all of((syntax-rules ((syntax-rules ((syntax-rules ...
[13:20:58] <sjamaan> s-liao: Macros are printed weirdly
[13:21:21] <sjamaan> They're also in the output in the default environment, but left out due to the default print length
[13:23:31] <s-liao> Is it a reliable way to look up the current-environment
[13:24:00] <sjamaan> It's an implementation detail and you probably shouldn't be using it in code
[13:25:52] <s-liao> Okay
[13:26:18] <s-liao> ,m chicken.base , then  (##sys#current-environment)  it works
[13:26:41] <s-liao> I mean for the chicken.base environment
[13:27:53] <s-liao> In the script, we would not touch this level source code.
[13:29:56] <vandusen> SPAM! SPAM! SPAM! by freee
[13:30:38] <sjamaan> s-liao: It gets cut off by the REPL's length limit
[13:30:45] <sjamaan> Try (print (##sys#current-environment)) and see for yourself
[13:31:29] <sjamaan> ##sys#repl-print-length-limit is set to 2048 to avoid too large output on the REPL
[13:34:29] <s-liao> Okay. I will port the output into the output file
[13:43:23] <s-liao> (scheme#with-output-to-file file (lambda () (scheme#write (##sys#current-environment)))))
[13:44:00] <s-liao> That is a piece of code to port the output into the output file.
[13:44:14] <s-liao> It ended up with the below error.
[13:44:32] <s-liao> [panic] out of memory - cannot allocate heap segment - execution terminated
[13:45:04] <s-liao> Seem like no end of the recursion。
[13:45:08] <sjamaan> Exactly
[13:46:17] <sjamaan> You could map "car" over it to get just the bindings
[13:46:28] <sjamaan> It's the values of those bindings that cause the problem
[13:47:21] <s-liao> (car (##sys#current-environment))?
[13:50:44] <sjamaan> (map car (##sys#current-environment))
[13:50:54] <s-liao> Yes.

[13:58:29] <Bunny351> right
[14:03:10] <s-liao> But why (##sys#current-environment) can work in the default RELP and ,m chicken.base
[14:03:47] <s-liao> when it is ,m r4rs-null (##sys#current-environment) can not work.

[14:37:57] <s-liao> But I remember that csi can handle circle list data.
[14:38:08] <s-liao> I mean it can be print out.
[14:38:27] <Bunny351> there is an egg for feading/printing, but csi on itself can only limit maximum output
[14:41:57] <s-liao> Okay. csi limit the maximum output

[23:16:13] <jcroisant> Or even better, I would like to add new wiki syntax like <hint>...</hint> and <warning>...</warning>. In that case maybe the images should be included in an egg? But I'm not sure which, or where.

[23:23:29] <wasamasa> uh
[23:23:38] <wasamasa> I guess it's easier to just put the images somewhere

[23:23:52] <wasamasa> my easy patch for fixing identifier parsing is still rotting away
[23:29:13] <jcroisant> Maybe svnwiki-sxml could just assume that the image can be found at the URL e.g. "/icons/warning.svg". And the image tag could have alt text "Warning" which would show even if the image is not found.

[23:46:46] <jcroisant> In which case I could start by adding the images to SVN, then maybe later add the new wiki syntax
