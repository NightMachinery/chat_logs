[08:41:40] <Spawns_Carpeting> I am very new to it, but how can I import a built in module? I have read the docs about modules but it never shows the exact syntax needed. I have tried (import file) (import (chicken file)) and much more with no luck
[08:42:01] <Spawns_Carpeting> i am running in script mode if that matters
[08:44:37] <Spawns_Carpeting> maybe they are not avail in the interpreter?

[08:52:24] <mdhughes> (import (chicken file))
[08:53:10] <mdhughes> Unfortunately CHICKEN's R5 with improvements, not R6 or R7, so there's no exact spec for it sometimes.
[08:54:48] <Spawns_Carpeting> hmm that throws an error for me saying the module doesn't exist

[09:21:34] <Spawns_Carpeting> would you say chicken is one of the more "modern" and well maintained schemes available currently? I've done a lot of research and tried out many lisps, and so far chicken seems to be the most modern feeling besides for racket and clojure
[09:22:30] <Spawns_Carpeting> trying to do something like stat a file and get its size in bytes in common lisp for example is a little rough. that's what I consider "not modern" feeling.
[09:22:35] <mdhughes> Sort of. It's very actively developed, there's a ton of libraries, and compiled CHICKEN is fast.
[09:22:58] <Spawns_Carpeting> yeah even the built in libs are pretty nice
[09:22:59] <mdhughes> But it's also based on an extremely old spec, you can just about make it pretend to be R7 but not really.
[09:23:22] <mdhughes> csi is one of the slowest interpreters, so you can't do "real work" at the REPL, you have to compile, which can take a while.
[09:23:50] <Spawns_Carpeting> i have a pretty fast computer so compile times aren't a big concern for me 
[09:23:59] <mdhughes> I was working in it for a couple years, and it's great, until you hit one of those problems.
[09:24:26] <Spawns_Carpeting> whats up with r5 vs r7? I am not familiar with the differences 
[09:24:54] *** Joins: tantanmen[m] (~tantanmen@2001:470:69fc:105::1:2212)
[09:25:03] <mdhughes> I use Chez these days. It "compiles" (JIT/implicitly in the interpreter) super fast, and is one of the fastest runtimes. It's R6 which is sometimes a little isolated, but we do have libraries for it.
[09:25:31] <mdhughes> https://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/
[09:25:56] <Spawns_Carpeting> i didn't realize there was an r6
[09:26:34] <mdhughes> R5's just old. Doesn't have modules, or advanced records, or much of anything. There was a big political hissy-fit by some of the less competent impls that they couldn't adopt R6, so they had R7-small, and now R7-large is mid-development.

[09:32:20] <Spawns_Carpeting> any thoughts on gnu guile vs chicken?
[09:32:26] <Spawns_Carpeting> they seem pretty similar honestly
[09:32:47] <Spawns_Carpeting> both are able to hook into C very easily, both provide a decent looking "stdlib"
[09:33:00] <mdhughes> I don't use GNU software if I can avoid it, so haven't tried guile.
[09:33:19] <flatwhatson> guile doesn't build native executables like chicken
[09:33:35] <daviid> mdhughes: why? don't youuse gnus/w i mean to ask
[09:33:37] <flatwhatson> it compiles the code, but you distribute scheme code not binaries
[09:33:47] <mdhughes> I do use gauche for smaller machines like RasPi, it works well for that.
[09:34:10] <Spawns_Carpeting> do you run BSD based software mdhughes ?
[09:34:27] <mdhughes> I greatly dislike Stallman, the FSF, and a lot of the Linux "culture".
[09:34:53] <mdhughes> I run a Mac when possible, BSD (mostly FreeBSD) for servers.
[09:35:30] <Spawns_Carpeting> very cool! I've wanted to give freebsd a chance for a while but I'm not so sure it's going to be wonderful for desktop use
[09:35:50] <Spawns_Carpeting> MacOS is of course pretty cool and very polished for desktop systems
[09:36:08] <mdhughes> It's not ideal for desktop, but if you get CDE up and running it's like the good old days on Solaris.
[09:36:57] <mdhughes> A Mac is a much better desktop with BSD-on-Mach underneath. Right tool for the job, instead of making everything fit one tool.
[09:37:41] <Zipheir> Guile is mostly R6RS; CHICKEN is R5RS+ with some R7 support.

[10:33:17] <Spawns_Carpeting> what is VALUE_EXP in this context?
[10:33:32] <Spawns_Carpeting> if its the actual expr, then what is BODY?
[10:33:46] <lockywolf> receive is in srfi-8
[10:34:02] <sjamaan> Spawns_Carpeting: BODY is the body in which NAME ... are bound
[10:35:02] <Spawns_Carpeting> okay I got it know. sorry for the super beginner questions
[10:35:06] <Spawns_Carpeting> thanks a ton 
[10:35:28] <Spawns_Carpeting> what is the purpose of having multiple return values rather than returning a list or vector of some sort?
[10:36:12] <sjamaan> It's similar to the reason you have functions accepting multiple arguments rather than accepting one argument which is a list or vector or something like that
[10:36:23] <Spawns_Carpeting> that makes sense!
[10:36:31] <sjamaan> In Scheme, it also falls naturally out of having continuations be so core to the language
[10:36:38] *** Joins: badkins (~badkins@136.56.92.199)
[10:37:05] <Spawns_Carpeting> very neat feature for sure
[10:37:05] <sjamaan> A continuation is modeled as just a procedure and it makes sense that it could receive multiple arguments, which is why procedures must be able to return multiple values
[10:37:36] <sjamaan> (because the "returning" of a procedure is just the invocation of its continuation with whatever its return values are)
[10:37:41] <Spawns_Carpeting> i still need to learn what a continuation is 
[10:37:48] <sjamaan> Sure, don't worry about it for now
[10:39:13] <Spawns_Carpeting> I have to head out for tonight, but thanks again for the help everyone
[10:40:01] <lockywolf> "delivering values to a continuation" is basically "returning values". but in Scheme a function may return values not only to the function call that had called it. (in particular because than function call may have already been eliminated)

[23:23:10] <amazigh> I mean it is very easy, except the wifi part.
[23:30:30] <Zipheir> I was mainly thinking about getting the bootloader to boot your OS.
[23:31:18] <Zipheir> I've read stories of people having a very hard time getting certain RPi models to boot anything other than the official OS.

[23:31:41] <Zipheir> Well, clearly you've done it.
[23:32:03] <sonny> I am building a list recursively, but I end up with an improper list '(1 2 3 4 . 0) instead of a proper one <https://bpa.st/S4JQ>, why is that?
[23:32:57] <Zipheir> Your base case is probably giving 0 instead of '(0), or something like that.
[23:33:12] <sonny> oh, yeah it is
[23:33:51] <sonny> '(0) has '() in it already, which would make it a proper list?
[23:34:08] <Zipheir> Yes.
[23:34:13] <amazigh> I do not remember about bootloader issues, except usb boot must be enabled somehow, I do not remember how.
[23:34:20] <Zipheir> It's also what (list 0) evaluates to.
[23:34:37] <amazigh> (of course when everything will not be proprietary, it will be better)
[23:34:49] <Zipheir> amazigh: That's encouraging news.
[23:35:01] <amazigh> yes
[23:35:42] <amazigh> now I will work on some big data ;)
[23:36:11] <amazigh> to clutter a few cycles in my vps lol
[23:37:39] <amazigh> it is been dormant for way too long, the cpu load is not even 1
[23:41:24] <amazigh> (at this time when calling `sudo halt` it will not shutdown, it just turn off the leds, even the monitor stays awake)
[23:51:18] <Zipheir> AoC this year has been fun so far!
[23:52:01] <sonny> yeah
