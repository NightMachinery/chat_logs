[23:22:55] <bookworm> fnutt: minidigger is alive but apparently not coming back to IRC, so I guess you are the mininapse theme master now https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/pull/4329#issuecomment-942016903
[23:23:22] <bookworm> I took over the shortcuts plugin
[23:23:32] <Activ8> he was forced off irc, waaaaa
[23:25:54] <xnaas> My guess is "most the things I was in moved to matrix" but idk lol
[23:27:08] <johncs> I wonder what they meant. I don't have much of an external reason to be on IRC tbh. Maybe their work used IRC
[23:27:34] <Activ8> possibly
[23:28:05] * xnaas was thinking about taking a look at XMPP üëÄ
[23:29:42] <bookworm> xmpp is a collection of various specs and nobody knows what the heck should be implemented. The clients look like garbage too
[23:30:32] <bookworm> they have some nonsense like addressing messages to a device rather than an account and other strange things
[23:30:59] <xnaas> sounds like IRC to me
[23:31:01] <xnaas> :P
[23:31:07] <bookworm> if you have to choose xmpp vs matrix I'd do IRC ;P
[23:31:23] <johncs> ahaha it does kinda sound like irc
[23:31:26] <xnaas> thelounge is the only usable IRC experience I've had (outside of IRCCloud) lol
[23:31:35] <bookworm> no, we don't even have the specs
[23:31:46] <bookworm> we have some drafts, xmpp actually has specs
[23:31:50] <johncs> ircv3 is doing their best over there
[23:32:02] <bookworm> they are bickering primarily
[23:32:08] <johncs> sounds like spec making to me
[23:32:11] <johncs> :P
[23:32:20] <xnaas> 33 years in, we'll get a spec someday?
[23:32:21] <xnaas> ;P
[23:33:02] <xnaas> and yeah, I don't bother with the matrix ecosystem at all lol ‚Äî that's an unusable mess imo
[23:33:05] <bookworm> we have a spec that everyone mostly ignores and a non ratified one which disagrees with the first and you effectively can't support
[23:33:28] <bookworm> then there's ircv3 which os in essence duct tape and glue
[23:33:33] <xnaas> It's the epitome of https://xkcd.com/927/
[23:33:37] <xnaas> re: matrix
[23:33:50] <bookworm> it holds together fairly well for that ;P, IRC that is
[23:34:14] <bookworm> matrix is just moving a tad to fast, rather than ironing out issues they want to have new features
[23:34:24] <xnaas> a lot of the world runs XMPP on the backend for stuff...why not spend time on something used so much üò©
[23:34:41] * xnaas blames Google, Facebook, etc. for bailing on it
[23:34:42] <xnaas> :P
[23:34:44] <bookworm> so they say, yet none of those systems federates
[23:35:00] <bookworm> weechat, fb messenger, hangouts etc
[23:35:09] <xnaas> wechat or weechat :P
[23:35:29] <xnaas> and speaking of IRC and weechat
[23:35:33] <xnaas> I don't know how people use it
[23:35:33] <bookworm> ew, was thinking about a different thing entirely
[23:35:37] <xnaas> I do as a fallback, but damn man
[23:35:43] <xnaas> I've never seen something get messages so slowly
[23:35:45] <bookworm> weechat? It's fucking awesome
[23:35:48] <xnaas> from an ircd on the same fuckign machine
[23:35:49] <bookworm> right up my alley
[23:36:12] <bookworm> then again I use neomutt and neovim as well, so cli is fine for me
[23:36:16] <xnaas> I get that it's extensible or whatever, but damn
[23:36:28] <xnaas> shouldn't your messaging client not be shit at getting messages in a timely manner?
[23:36:29] <xnaas> lol
[23:36:41] <bookworm> hm? I never noticed any slowdown
[23:36:50] <xnaas> it's hilarious to see side-by-side with thelounge
[23:36:58] <xnaas> same sub-1s responses from bot in thelounge
[23:37:03] <xnaas> weechat just sitting there, boom 3s later
[23:37:07] <bookworm> he?
[23:37:14] <xnaas> he?
[23:37:25] <bookworm> heh* probably
[23:37:35] <xnaas> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[23:37:39] <bookworm> noisy of astonishment
[23:37:44] <bookworm> noise*
[23:37:57] <bookworm> phone keyboard... not even once
[23:37:59] <xnaas> dunno, talked to some canadian who has seen similar so just gonna assume it's bad :P
[23:38:20] <xnaas> Other CLI clients I've tried haven't had any issues, but they're...super, super basic :P
[23:38:35] <xnaas> I do like having some features for my "worst case scenario fallback" option 
[23:39:41] <bookworm> nah, worst case scenario is telnet and manually typing pong every few seconds :P

[23:41:27] <xnaas> Anyway, it's not too horribly surprising that Riot wouldn't want to federate their League of Legends chat lol
[23:41:37] <xnaas> (as one example)
[23:41:44] <bookworm> why would they care?
[23:41:57] <xnaas> properly controlling your experience, utterly ;P
[23:41:59] <bookworm> the point of xmpp is that it should in principle be like email
[23:42:45] <bookworm> but that brings with it the inability to innovate and move quickly as you need to essentially let the others catch up, some might not share your vision too
[23:42:56] <bookworm> so I can see why... still annoying
[23:43:12] <Activ8> as in nope, I would not do that 
[23:45:25] <xnaas> email dead when /s
[23:45:50] <bookworm> email would be less bad if admins would fix their systems
[23:45:55] <Activ8> email needs to die but so does likes of facebook, twitter e.t.c
[23:46:04] <bookworm> alas they don't, meaning we can't actually enable strict dmarc
[23:46:19] <bookworm> nor force TLS for smtp
[23:46:47] <xnaas> We should fix everything until it's broken.
[23:46:52] <Activ8> ha
[23:46:59] <bookworm> so far email is the only thing that has the ability to do decent threading of messengers I commonly use
[23:47:25] <xnaas> brief looking at XMPP stuff, though, I'm not seeing anything as braindead simple as ergo (previously oragono) was to setup for IRC
[23:47:38] <xnaas> I tried all the ircds out there but they were all utter nightmares to setup
[23:47:47] <bookworm> there's snicket (docker thingy) and some other "easy to setup" server
[23:47:51] <xnaas> I suspect XMPP servers will prove as or more awful :P
[23:48:47] <xnaas> also
[23:48:49] <Activ8> no need with xmpp we have a good solution right here
[23:48:49] <xnaas> what I'm hearing
[23:48:50] <bookworm> xmpp has a bunch of moving parts, meaning optional things you can enable and that makes it less trivial to setup. Especially if you want to include a TURN or STUN server (or whatever those protocols are, can't remember from the top of my head)
[23:48:50] <Activ8> ha
[23:49:00] <xnaas> is that we just need email to be the backend for everything
[23:49:03] <xnaas> üòâ
[23:49:21] <xnaas> every chat message you send ‚Üí actually an email
[23:49:28] <bookworm> there is a messenger that uses email... at which point you might as well just use email
[23:49:39] <xnaas> oh lawd
[23:49:55] <xnaas> I guess I'm not too surprised.
[23:50:02] <bookworm> email also evolves... there's jmap for instance. Only almost no one supports it yet
[23:50:03] <xnaas> There's nothing more ubiquitous than email.
[23:52:16] <MaxLeiter> bookworm: does litbot have memoserv capabilties?
[23:52:36] <bookworm> don't know, limnoria does I think, yes
[23:52:45] <bookworm> meaning we could shove it into wendy
[23:52:54] <Activ8> or hell nah "every chat message an email" nope nope nope
[23:54:30] <bookworm> MaxLeiter: https://docs.limnoria.net/use/plugins/Later.html
[23:55:10] <MaxLeiter> cheers
[23:55:15] <bookworm> or https://docs.limnoria.net/use/plugins/Note.html if you want a more private thing
[23:55:19] <bookworm> which one do you want?
[23:55:59] <MaxLeiter> Note
[23:56:05] <MaxLeiter> just for let people know something when they're offline, like mooff atm 
[23:56:12] <MaxLeiter> letting, even
[23:56:15] <MaxLeiter> s/offline/dc'd
[23:58:46] <Activ8> is that just for you max or you devs thinking about putting that in 4.3.0
