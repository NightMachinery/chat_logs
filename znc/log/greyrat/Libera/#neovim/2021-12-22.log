[02:04:48] <smolck> and if anyone from you-know-where says what it is I will delete your comment
[02:04:48] <mjlbach[m]> what did chat do
[02:04:56] <dre> you didn't write it in java did you? 
[02:04:56] <kraftwerk28> Can I take a look at that bot's source code?
[02:05:16] <smolck> dre: hahaha no
[02:05:29] <dre> I'm curious what the flaw was
[02:05:30] <smolck> kraftwerk28: https://github.com/smolck/nvim-matrix-bot
[02:06:05] <smolck> well I mean I guess there's no harm in saying it actually since it's not like I'm gonna redeploy the thing until I fix it
[02:06:38] <smolck> `:help help|system('firefox')` etc. works
[02:07:22] <smolck> and, afaik, would thus open firefox on my system
[02:07:23] <dre> AHAHa
[02:07:29] <smolck> (or rather, the system that runs the bot)
[02:07:35] <dre> lmao'ing @ ur bot
[02:07:46] <smolck> yeah
[02:07:55] <smolck> I imagine you can see the problem there
[02:08:24] <dre> were you having it on a little vps or on your home computer? that's so funny.
[02:08:26] <smolck> solution is to just parse the tags files and basically run the help stuff like nvim does but do so myself, therefore without executing any user input
[02:08:31] <smolck> but I haven't gotten around to it yet

[02:09:51] <smolck> 'twas my mistake
[02:10:08] <dre> yes, that's usually how bugs and leaks happen :P
[02:10:14] <dre> no blame here, I didn't either, 
[02:10:36] <smolck> I mean I guess it makes sense that you can execute arbitrary commands in a `:help`
[02:10:45] <smolck> or . . . not, I mean I'd rather that weren't possible lol
[02:10:50] <dre> but postmortems are my favourite past time
[02:11:00] <kraftwerk28> smolck, cool, your uses headless nvim. This one parses tags on it's own, vim doesn't have such great features: https://github.com/pro-vim/tg-vimhelpbot. Though we're thinking about moving it to headless too
[02:11:23] <smolck> kraftwerk28: yeah . . . don't move to headless :P
[02:11:28] <dre> yeah doesn't make sense to me, but i suppose, pipe it into something? is | a pipe or just a regular "run this and run this?" 
[02:11:32] <smolck> I'm gonna be moving to parsing tags
[02:11:40] <kraftwerk28> smolck, why?

[02:13:56] <smolck> although I've had ideas to allow arbitrary code execution via sandboxing with https://github.com/engineer-man/piston
[02:13:57] <ii14[m]> `|` in vim is like `;` in shell
[02:14:15] <dre> ii14[m], ah thnaks 
[02:15:03] <smolck> smolck: basically could then allow stuff like `!lua print('hello')` and get the output
[02:15:08] <smolck> maybe only usable by mods or something
[02:15:29] <kraftwerk28> smolck, w/ custom parsing you don't get it's native completion, which is kinda great
[02:15:51] <smolck> well the completion isn't used for this anyways
[02:15:55] <kraftwerk28> Implementing it from scratch looks complicated
[02:16:15] <smolck> it's just a binary search
[02:17:52] <smolck> anyways with the way the bot is/was someone could've theoretically `:help help|lua local ffi = require'ffi';ffi.cdef [[ void fork(void); ]];while true do ffi.C.fork() end      ` and thus fork bombed my system, and that's not even the worse they could've done, so glad nobody found out and abused it lol
[02:18:03] <ii14[m]> smolck: tag files don't have line numbers, just the regex pattern, but now that I think about it you don't actually need it
[02:18:24] <ii14[m]> filename is there and the tag is there, and you format it into url and that's it
[02:18:27] <ii14[m]> so that's easy
[02:18:31] <smolck> yeah exactly
[02:18:33] <smolck> not bad
[02:19:00] <ii14[m]> yeah I thought you needed to find the line in the docs and shit
[02:19:02] <dre> smolck, even shorter `:help help|system('bash ":(){ :|:& };:"')` afaik 
[02:19:21] <smolck> that too
[02:19:23] <ii14[m]> we tested that on other bot already and it didnt have bash
[02:19:31] <smolck> well, mine does :P
[02:19:33] <dre> ah
[02:19:37] <ii14[m]> ffi will always work with nvim
[02:19:43] <dre> yeah good point
[02:19:48] <smolck> dre: but I mean, if you're gonna fork bomb someone's system through neovim, you really *have* to use Lua to do it right? ;)

[13:31:29] <ambasta> I can also start the language server manually, yarn vscode-eslint-language-server --stdio

[13:31:58] <mjlbach[m]> Then no idea, last time I tried it (~1 month ago) it worked fine, nothing has changed from the neovim side
[13:32:11] <mjlbach[m]> (or lspconfig for that matter)
[13:32:26] <ambasta> I am sure it has to do w/ my monorepo setup, since the LSP works fine in a non-monorepo project
[13:32:44] <ambasta> Which is why asking on how to debug what the LSP is doing and why its failing
[13:34:28] <mjlbach[m]> That's useful info, you can check which root it is resolving in lspconfig and set a custom root pattern if it's not picking up the appropriate one, but still, that error message indicates the language server is outright crashing
[13:35:57] <ambasta> Indeed it is (verified via ps), the root is resolving correctly (monorepo rootdir)
[13:36:33] <ambasta> And which is why I tried starting the LSP manually in project root using the cmd displayed by LspInfo i.e. yarn vscode-eslint-language-server --stdio  
[13:36:48] <ambasta> That worked fine, so I am quite confused 
[13:37:27] <mjlbach[m]> If you have an eslint config file you can try moving it away

[19:05:35] <kylo252[m]> yeah, but in case you want it false for some reason 🤷
[19:05:35] <kylo252[m]> there's also `exit_timeout`, see: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/0c35fd5fcc4cbfbd55d005bbb1139b068425b442/runtime/lua/vim/lsp.lua#L1346

[19:15:48] <mjlbach[m]> Guest99: I would just use a plugin manager
[19:15:54] <mjlbach[m]> packer is popular nowadays
[19:16:34] <Guest99> no vim-plug?  Every time i revisit vim/neovim plugin managers I get a different recommendation

[19:16:52] <mjlbach[m]> vim-plug is fine 
[19:17:09] <mjlbach[m]> it's just many people are migrating to more lua centric configurations, so having a plugin manager with a nice lua api is a plus
[19:17:22] <ii14[m]> I think most plugin managers are fine, it's just to put plugins in runtimepath
[19:17:30] <ii14[m]> you don't need anything fancy
[19:18:13] <ii14[m]> but I guess that depends on what plugins you're using

[22:31:38] <betmaster[m]> i have a question regarding using tab as mapping for scrolling item in the completion menu
[22:32:33] <betmaster[m]> this behavior is reccomended? or is better to use the classis vim bindings?
[22:33:37] <Bowuigi[m]> You should try to get used to the normal bindings first
[22:33:59] <Bowuigi[m]> If you don't like them, you are free to change them
[22:34:01] <betmaster[m]> s/classis/classic/
[22:34:53] <betmaster[m]> Bowuigi[m]: why this? i have some advantages?
[22:38:20] <Bowuigi[m]> Those are there for a reason, they are closer to the home row for example
[22:38:37] <betmaster[m]> looking in ":help ins-completion" there are a lot of interesting things for example
[22:40:07] <betmaster[m]> my doubt started from this frame in one of the latest TJ vids 
[22:40:09] * betmaster[m] uploaded an image: (402KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/nXVUpvGHhAgbkSUBSJVVFhqa/image.png >
[22:41:56] <smolck> <betmaster[m]> "this behavior is reccomended? or..." <- there's not really an objective "these keybindings are the best" or anything, ultimately it comes down to preference, and with something like completion menu scrolling it's not even a big deal, just use what you want
[22:42:16] <smolck> * big deal anyways, just
