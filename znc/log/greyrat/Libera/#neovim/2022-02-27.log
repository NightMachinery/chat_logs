[09:54:10] <mjlbach[m]> lspconfig is like vim-lsp-settings
[09:54:22] <mjlbach[m]> something like vim-lsp is built-into neovim itself
[09:54:39] <mjlbach[m]> <zachel[m]> "is lspconfig supposed to hang..." <- no, lspconfig does nothing on leaving insert mode that would cause a hang
[09:54:46] <mjlbach[m]> neither does the built-in client for that matter
[09:55:32] <zachel[m]> Hmm weird.
[09:55:32] <zachel[m]> My guess was that the LSP parses the code again when I leave the insert mode
[09:56:05] <mjlbach[m]> nope
[09:57:07] <zachel[m]> Now I have no clue why it happens
[09:57:07] <zachel[m]> Maybe it's the other plugin.
[09:57:38] <zachel[m]> Can't think of one though, it's nearly the same project with different dependencies.
[10:00:19] <zachel[m]> Yup, it's not the LSP for sure.

[16:11:55] <clason[m]> Yes
[16:12:03] <clason[m]> But maybe wait for 1.44.0
[16:12:35] <clason[m]> (we need 1.43.0 for the threading stuff, but that had a bug preventing it to build on BSD, so we're currently on master)
[16:17:04] <spam[m]> Okie I thought so :) just wanted some confirmation that it was a waiting on luv thing. I read here: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/17219
[16:17:40] <bfredl> <jamessan[m]> "> <@chistole:matrix.org> Heyooo,..." <- yes, we just did that yesterday.
[16:17:51] <clason[m]> but if you're on arch, you can just bump to 1.43.0
[16:18:00] <jamessan[m]> Why isn't CMakeLists.txt checking for that minimum version (or symbol)?
[16:18:51] <clason[m]> 'cause the PR just landed in the last 24 hours?

[16:22:06] <clason[m]> I'm not sure if LUV needs to be bumped in concert
[16:22:48] <jamessan[m]> If a PR is raising a minimum version of a dep, it should certainly reflect that in the CMakeLists.txt
[16:23:39] <clason[m]> I just bumped the bundled version; I did not add code that used it
[16:23:42] <bfredl> CI catches that CI is misconfigured? Because for C deps only the specific version stated is supported (sometimes specific commits, for shorter periods of time in master dev). Distro packages that aim to follow master are not officially supported will naturally lag behind somewhat.

[16:27:54] <jamessan[m]> bfredl: There was an outstanding request to have some sanity checks that we don't break non-bundled builds, which I rolled into the lint check.  I can help provide updates to those system deps, since they'll pull from the PPA if needed.
[16:28:26] <jamessan[m]> However, that doesn't address the "bump to random commit" stuff, which I'm generally not a fan of anyway
[16:28:46] <bfredl> sure. again, I am speaking of master versions of neovim
[16:28:48] <clason[m]> Yeah, but sometimes it's the best option

[16:29:06] <spam[m]> <clason[m]> "but if you're on arch, you can..." <- Sorry not quite sure what you mean here? My system libuv version is `1.43.0-1`
[16:29:08] <bfredl> as soon as neovim is preparing a release, we should only depend on released deps
[16:29:08] <clason[m]> especially during development on master
[16:29:18] <bfredl> jamessan[m]: exactly my point.
[16:29:19] <clason[m]> spam[m]: then that should be good
[16:29:41] <bfredl> and sometimes we need to co-develop stuff with c code that happens to be in deps
[16:29:43] <jamessan[m]> Does it also need 1.43 libluv?
[16:29:53] <clason[m]> possibly; I bumped both
[16:30:08] <bfredl> though in this case, we did bump libluv to an actual release..

[16:38:36] <Exa> Hi, there is a regression from neovim 0.5.0 that affects me, I'd like to fix the bug myself but it's difficult to understand the commit that adds the regression.  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/15007  Is there a way I can get some help?  Reverting the commit on each version is not quite easy.  Thanks.
[16:40:16] <spam[m]> jamessan[m]: I noticed I actually didn't have `libluv` on arch both `libluv` and `lua-luv` exist but appear to be the same thing. I tested with either or and the error with undefined references to `luv_set_thread` and `luv_set_cthread`
[16:40:41] <clason[m]> which version?
[16:40:43] <bfredl> latest in arch is `libuv 1.43.0-1` and `libluv 1.43.0_0-1`
[16:40:51] <bfredl> you need libluv, not just lua-luv
[16:40:58] <clason[m]> that should be fine then
[16:40:59] <spam[m]> bfredl: these 
[16:41:30] <bfredl> oki, then I would suspect something fishy in the neovim-git PKGBUILD, it is not overriding the version?
[16:42:28] <jamessan[m]> cmake usually needs some hand-holding to know where to find libluv
[16:43:19] <spam[m]> `libuv 1.43.0-1` `libluv 1.43.0_0-1` and `lua-luv 1.43.0_0-1` 
[16:43:19] <spam[m]> same set thread undefined references persist.
[16:44:24] <bfredl> hopefully if it is called "libluv" it should be setup as an ordinary c library (and not need hacks to use the luv lua module as a c lib)
[16:47:31] <spam[m]> it's living in `usr/lib` 🤷‍♂

[18:57:25] <Exa> it seems to break vim when I do what I tried
[18:57:51] <Exa> but that's on me, because nvim-lspconfig is not compatible with vim, so I can't include it in my config
[18:57:58] <clason[m]> vim should just ignore `.lua` files
[18:58:29] <clason[m]> so you can just plop those into `plugin`, and Neovim will read them while Vim will ignore them. No `has('nvim')` required
[18:59:42] <Exa> clason[m]: vim supports Lua too
[19:00:51] <clason[m]> not in the same way
[19:01:01] <Exa> since I use built-in pack feature, which both works in vim and neovim, I can't load neovim-only plugins only in neovim, not sure if there is a way around it
[19:01:04] <clason[m]> unless they changed something recently
[19:01:29] <clason[m]> Exa: use different package directories
[19:01:41] <clason[m]> or switch to an rtp-based package manager
[19:01:41] <clason[m]> s/package/plugin/
[19:01:52] <Exa> clason[m]: how so? I never defined which "package" directory is used
[19:02:17] <Exa> I don't want to use an external package manager, I copy every 3rd party dependency in my config
[19:02:26] <clason[m]> `:set packpath?`
[19:03:14] <clason[m]> I know you don't want to hear this, but I think trying to share a non-trivial config between Neovim and Vim is an anti-pattern
[19:03:22] <Exa> I have included all plugins in a "pack/vendor" directory
[19:03:41] <clason[m]> yeah, don't do that, is what I'm saying
[19:04:09] <clason[m]> have a common package directory, and one for Neovim-only plugins (and one for the soon-to-appear Vim9-only plugins).
[19:04:39] <clason[m]> Then add the latter to `packpath` behind a `has('nvim')` guard
[19:04:46] <arshiaaghaei[m]> So I installed coc.nvim
[19:05:11] <arshiaaghaei[m]> And when I use the tab shortcut for autocomplete it won't work
[19:05:20] <arshiaaghaei[m]> How do I find where in my init.nvim is conflicting
[19:05:37] <Exa> clason[m]: if I add a path in packpath, on neovim only, my plugins in pack/vendor will still get loaded?
[19:05:49] <Exa> (this path won't point to a directory in pack)
[19:06:27] <clason[m]> well, that path should still be in `packpath`, of course
[19:06:46] <clason[m]> you just add a path, not replace it
