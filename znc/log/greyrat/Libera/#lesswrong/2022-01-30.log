Amazon has long had a goal of hiring "missionaries" – people zealous about working at Amazon even though the pay lags rivals – not "mercenaries." And "frugality" is one of Amazon's 16 vaunted principles. Those ideals are now
[00:00:35] <feepbot> clashing with a falling share price, high expectations for employee performance during the pandemic, and an intense talent war, insiders say. Those who spoke to Insider for this story asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics. The higher attrition is starting to strain Amazon operations, said one longtime manager in Amazon's consumer division who's seen 30% of the

Combining this elevated turnover "with a ridiculous hiring process, and we are likely to have understaffed teams for a long time," he said. Turnover among US-based Amazon Web Services engineers was at least 35% last year, according to two insiders. An Amazon spokesperson said that was overstated without providing specific data.

[01:53:56] <gwern> I'm glad they properly appreciate how good the xbox controller was for halo
[01:54:21] <gwern> aside from being too large and heavy, the first xbox controller was probably the best video game controller ever then
[01:54:42] <gwern> if the only thing it did was make FPSes awesome on consoles, that'd be enough, but it was just great in general
[01:56:04] <quanticle> Yeah, Sony's DualShock was nowhere near as good
[01:57:26] <gwern> I don't remember anyone even trying. heck, I don't remember anything even using them, they were just so much dead weight for all the PS games I ever played. maybe the rhythm games used them?
[02:00:23] <quanticle> PS? You mean PS2, right? The XBox was released as a peer of the PlayStation 2, whose controller did have analog sticks, and whose games did make extensive use of them.
[02:01:00] <quanticle> It's just that because of the placement (both sticks at the bottom, rather than offset like on XBox), using the PS2's controller for a shooter wasn't actually all that fun.
[02:01:20] <quanticle> But it was fine for e.g. Gran Turismo and platforming games like Jak and Daxter.
[02:01:39] <gwern> no, it was for PS1 as well
[02:02:42] <gwern> and pretty much every game worked without using the dualshock analog controllers, or if they did, it just required one or something. although now I'm wondering why no one ever hit on the Halo config, because the dualshocks + shoulder buttons should've worked reasonably well
[02:02:54] <gwern> were they not precise enough
[02:02:56] <quanticle> Wait, the DualShock controllers were available on PS1? Huh, I ddin't realize.

[03:16:11] <feepbot> <gwern> 'They hated the name. They said that it doesn’t mean anything, and to people it does mean something to, it’s not on-brand, because what we’re selling is the super soldier, not this weird space junk. In every foreign language it sounds stupid, it’s feminine—they had so many reasons why the name should be changed. They went for months and months, and they came back
[03:16:11] <feepbot> with a bunch of names. It was another border dispute. At some point they said, “Okay, we’re going to do a subtitle.” And this was before subtitles were the thing every game had. We thought that was dumb, but whatever, we could ignore it. Eventually they came back with Combat Evolved, and we thought that was the stupidest thing ever. It doesn’t mean anything, it’s not
[03:16:11] <feepbot> really informational, and it’s not even good grammar.'
[03:21:11] <feepbot> <gwern> 'I was in the meeting where Master Chief was named. I think it was me, Jason, our artist Rob McClees and Joe Staten. We were already working with (Fall of Reach author) Eric Nylund, who came up with name John. But you weren’t going to run around getting called John in the game—that wasn’t going to fly. So, in thinking about other ways we could name him, Rob said,
[03:21:11] <feepbot> “Well, we could give him a rank.” I was like, okay, Sergeant then. But Rob said, “Well, he’s a marine, right? So it has to be a naval rank.” So I said, “Okay, he’s a Commander. He’s like James Bond.” Rob is a stickler for military accuracy, and he’s the reason the shotgun shells have a little dent where the firing pin hits. He said commanders don’t get sent
[03:21:11] <feepbot> into fights. So we looked up ranks in the US navy, and above this certain line you’re no longer considered expendable. Looking there, Master Chief was the highest non-commission officer rank that’s considered expendable. We thought the name sounded stupid, but it just kind of stuck.'
[03:26:12] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Jaime Griesemer Multiplayer was also kind of bad until very shortly before the game shipped. You would just shoot at a guy forever, and they wouldn’t die. Me and a couple of the other designers, including Max, said: “You know what? We’ve got to hit the reset button.” So we flattened it all out and rebuilt it from scratch. It’s amazing that it came out as well as
[03:26:12] <feepbot> it did, really. Paul Bertone Multiplayer is actually something that was on the chopping block until very close to the end of the project, which would've been an obvious tragedy. Max Hoberman The original plans for multiplayer, pre-Microsoft even, were always to do something less head-to-head and more arena-based. On Halo the team just ran out of time and ended up shoehorning it in.
[03:26:12] <feepbot> It was never really by design, the way it worked. It was just a scramble to get something done.'
[03:31:12] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Jaime Griesemer We didn’t see Jason for a while after Halo 2 shipped. We had a cut-out of him printed out on cardboard, and we put it in the corner of the room. Marty O’Donnell We would just stand that up in meetings.'
[03:34:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> oof
[03:34:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's funny, a similar thing happened with Oni
[03:34:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> They had multiplayer, it had issues
[03:34:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then
[03:34:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> They didn't managed to fix them by release time
[03:34:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> So they just removed multiplayer
[03:34:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> And it was a single-player game

It’s here in February 2019 that a South Asian family came home one night to find their residence ransacked. Burglars had broken through a glass door at the back of the home sometime between 5:30 and 10:30 p.m. and made off with gold jewelry and
[07:06:20] <quanticle> a large safe. The losses were staggering, adding up to hundreds of thousands of dollars."

A Pest station exchanges authenticably-encrypted messages exclusively with an operator-configured set of _peers_ known as a WOT

[09:50:53] <PlanckWalk> In that case yes it would dereference memory at 100
[09:52:05] <zeroc00l0> Maybe we're also making some assumption about how structs are implemented that the std doesn't specify.  Maybe the impl needs to read a value at 100 first before it knows how to get the struct member.
[09:53:17] <quanticle> I guess my other question is, if I do struct s_type {int hi; int lo;}; struct t_type {int hi; int med; int lo;}; 100->lo; how would the compiler know what offset to apply?

In fact, a number of computers and other devices label these ports RS-232, which is a bold move because they are almost universally non-compliant with that specification.

[10:06:19] <quanticle> with, you guessed it, 25 pins. 'Good god, 25 pins for a simple serial connection?' you say. That's right, 25 pins.

[10:23:34] <quanticle> calls---chiefly for display to the user. This is why dialing common international emergency numbers like 999 and 110 on a US cellular phone still results in a connection to 911---in actuality no dialing happens at all, when the dialer app determines that the number entered appears to be an emergency call it instead issues an AT command with no phone number at all."

[14:38:01] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, if it's only a pyramid scheme it doesn't work in a finite world, but if the pyramid-scheme part is merely to bootstrap the network effects into place it's not automatically unworkable. one problem of course is that pyramid schemes want to distort what's known about them.
[14:38:52] <feep> every cause wants to be a pyramid scheme
[14:39:26] <Gurkenglas> but also: this goes both directions, and people who don't want there to exist a pyramid scheme want to distort in the other direction.

[14:39:51] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, i don't get the pun because what does that mean
[14:41:29] <Gurkenglas> distort in the other direction <- but one level up, it's hard enough to find Schelling points for what to cooperate into existence, so "distort all pyramid schemes down to prevent them from happening" is a reasonable heuristic

[14:52:57] <PlanckWalk> Because Löb's theorem only applies to formal systems

Some of those statements are about the contents of my head, in particular about my beliefs about quoted statements. For every belief about some (parametrized) quoted belief, we can build a quine so that it the belief is about its own quoted version, right?
[15:11:56] <PlanckWalk> Eh, partly.
[15:12:04] <Gurkenglas> What part is wrong?
[15:12:11] <PlanckWalk> If your head happens to be formalizable in a purely syntactic system.

[15:13:01] <PlanckWalk> So for example a belief about some particular state of 10^15 synapses?
[15:13:17] <Gurkenglas> Well, I don't think in terms of synapses. I think in terms of people and their beliefs.
[15:13:39] <Gurkenglas> Mentioning meat helps resolve some confusions.
[15:13:43] <PlanckWalk> Well, you were talking about "contents of my head", and clarified to "meat"

[15:19:23] <Gurkenglas> Nice. Löb's theorem implies Gödel's incompleteness theorem, perhaps that one is easier to analyse. Do I believe "I don't believe this statement."?
[15:20:17] <feep> I think PlanckWalk's point is that these are proofs that don't "sorta work if they're sorta applicable"
[15:21:00] <PlanckWalk> Gurkenglas: I don't know, do you?
[15:21:10] <Gurkenglas> I'm trying to parse it :)
[15:21:53] <Gurkenglas> feep, I expect that then there is some step of the proof that doesn't sorta work if it's sorta applicable, and I'm trying to find it
[15:25:57] <PlanckWalk> For Gödel's theorem the step that doesn't work is probably around "I can express my deduction rules and axioms in terms of PA"
[15:26:18] <PlanckWalk> Even if some superintelligence could, I bet *you* can't.
[15:26:22] <PlanckWalk> (Or me)
[15:26:29] <PlanckWalk> I definitely can't for myself.
[15:26:58] <Gurkenglas> Some of my beliefs are wrong. If I believe that I believe something, that doesn't imply that I believe it. If PA proves that PA proves something, does that imply that PA proves it? I think I remember so, but I suddenly don't see how.
[15:28:29] <Gurkenglas> It's easy from Löb's theorem that PA(PA(phi)) => PA(phi), I guess.
[15:28:33] <PlanckWalk> If PA is consistent, then it only proves true statements, so in particular if it proves that it proves P then it proves P.
[15:28:50] <PlanckWalk> If it's inconsistent then it proves everything, which includes P.
[15:28:54] <Gurkenglas> PlanckWalk, how does it follow that if PA is consistent then it only proves true statements?
[15:29:11] <Gurkenglas> I thought consistency is about not proving false statements.
[15:29:35] <feep> which means it only proves true statements, no?
[15:29:41] <feep> (tho not all of them)
[15:30:11] <Gurkenglas> uhhhh. um. yes but some part of my is complaining, one moment
[15:32:31] <Gurkenglas> Consistent means you never prove something and its opposite. In particular you don't prove false, assuming you prove true. If PA proves PA(phi) (and happens to be wrong), then how does it follow that PA proves false?
[15:33:01] <Gurkenglas> after all, the formula after proves is always in quotes.
[15:34:15] <Gurkenglas> a false statement, after all, might not necessarily by one such that you can *prove* that it implies false.
[15:35:39] <Gurkenglas> (to be clear, i have backpedalled from "consistency is about not proving false statements")
[15:36:21] <PlanckWalk> That's where it's absolutely crucial that the system doing the proof is a *formal* system.
[15:36:57] <PlanckWalk> That is, all its axioms and inference rules can be represented as arithmetic statements.
[15:37:21] <PlanckWalk> Ungodly huge arithmetic statements, usually.
[15:37:41] <Gurkenglas> I continue to suspect that you're overestimating the important of that!
[15:38:13] <PlanckWalk> It's the critical step in Gödel's incompleteness theorem, so <shrug>
[15:38:29] <Gurkenglas> Which step is the critical step?
[15:38:55] <PlanckWalk> The one where you can represent the formal system's rules as arithmetic statements.
[15:39:18] <PlanckWalk> Which means that you can express provability in the system as an object *of* the system.
[15:42:06] <PlanckWalk> There are FOL systems (weaker than PA) where you can't do that, and the incompleteness theorem doesn't apply to them.
[15:42:37] <PlanckWalk> And in fact some of them can prove all the truths of the system.

[15:43:14] <PlanckWalk> For every proposition, you can prove either the proposition or its negation.
[15:43:50] <PlanckWalk> But they're too weak to be useful as a foundation for math, which was the whole point of Gödel's work.
[15:44:42] <PlanckWalk> Well, that particular part of his work
[15:45:20] <Gurkenglas> The arithmetic part is just for the existence of quines, right?

[15:48:11] <PlanckWalk> Hmm, that would imply that immigration to bolster population may depress local population growth.

[15:49:16] <two2thehead> PlanckWalk, iirc that's what's happening in the US and Canada
[15:49:37] <two2thehead> most population 'growth' is as a result of immigrants having children
