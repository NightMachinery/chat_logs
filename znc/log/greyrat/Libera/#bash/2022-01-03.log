[00:06:08] <earnest> Much of the limitations in POSIX utils can be picked up by little shell scripts, such as with find and -exec sh -c '...' _ {} +, although this does implicate arg_max in this specific case which makes it more tricky

[16:20:47] <Soliton> missing quotes and sh cannot export functions anyway.
[16:21:07] <Soliton> sh also does not support the function keyword.
[16:21:26] <Soliton> and you call a function just by its name.
[16:22:52] <Soliton> quite confusing code so no idea what the goal is.
[16:23:52] *** Joins: ravan (~ravan@user/ravan)
[16:24:07] <Soliton> no local variable anywhere in sight, btw.
[16:24:14] <Blondie101010> and the script name doesn't match the comment
[16:24:21] <pj> !.sh
[16:24:22] <greybot> Don't use extensions for your scripts. Scripts define new commands that you can run, and commands are generally not given extensions. Do you run ls.elf? Also: bash scripts are *not* sh scripts (so don't use .sh) and the extension will only cause dependencies headaches if the script gets rewritten in another language. See http://www.talisman.org/~erlkonig/documents/commandname-extensions-considered-harmful
[16:24:46] <Blondie101010> oh well, that is not useless at all
[16:25:34] <Soliton> if you source a script to get a function definition there is no function exporting needed either way.
[16:26:11] <pj> version_check only changes $my_version if $tmp_version is set, but you never set $tmp_version.
[16:26:17] <Blondie101010> all in all, this was written by someone who didn't bother to read ANY bash documentation or try anything first
[16:26:25] <Soliton> so once you remove the useless export and fix the function call then maybe it already does what you want.
[16:26:38] <Blondie101010> it's 99.9% bad
[16:26:40] <pj> that's the real reason it's not working but there's heaps of other issues there.

What Id like to do is, create the video, then have a cron job automatically invoke rsync when there is a change in the directory, copy the files, then have kdenlive automatically start encoding on another machine
[17:55:37] <MrCollinsGA> so the flow is raw video files (mov,mp4,mkv etc) go into a directory on NAS, that directory is monitored by rsync on encoder machine, (headless ubuntu) when a file shows up in that directory the file is copied to encoder, then kdenlive stitches the videos together, and begins encoding, once the encoding is done the file is copied back to NAS waiting for me to do something with it

[19:23:27] <greybot> inotifywait is a shell interface to the Linux inotify API for filesystem events. inotifywait isn't safe for robust scripts because it can't output nul delimiters. Better cross-platform alternatives are watchdog (python) and System.IO.FileSystemWatcher (mono/.NET) which both support inotify, kqueue, Windows fs events, etc. https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools/

[19:47:03] <shad> Hi, i have a big ansible template file with a lot of "{{ MY_VAR }}", "{{ MY_OTHER_VAR }}" inside. How can I grep every token in between "{{ * }}" ?
[19:47:19] <shad> objective is to list every template variables in that file
[19:48:41] <phy1729> What about {{ foo | some_filter }} ? I'd see if jinja can give you what you want since it has a proper parser for the language

[20:36:24] <nickdiazswag209> if its not used
[20:36:54] <Soliton> you need to use it there so the remaining arguments are $1 $2 etc.
[20:37:14] <Soliton> if you don't then the first filename will be $0.
[20:37:45] <Soliton> if your write your shell code accordingly you can make that work but it's weird especially if errors get involved.

[22:00:22] <Soliton> in a script monitor mode shouldn't be on to begin with and if it is it's presumably for a reason. so maybe you rather want to use timeout --foreground which will not send to the process group.

[23:15:22] <greycat> I do it, and it's not a bad assumption.  You know your cron jobs run from $HOME.
[23:15:45] <gordonfish> (Supposedly it is the user's directory but that might vary from one system/cron-implementation to the next.

[23:42:13] <greycat> But still, you're supply a source directory in USER@HOST:DIR format, so it's going to use ssh (or rsh) for that.
