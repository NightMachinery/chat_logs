[00:18:13] <Jong> Hello. What opinions do you think AI will have on philosophical topics?
[00:18:34] <Jong> Will AI be a utalitarianist?
[00:18:49] <Jong> a consequentialist?
[00:19:12] <Jong> Will AI finally show us why one theory is wrong and the other is right?
[00:22:35] <Jong> Will AI replace our legal system with perfect logical reasoning?
[00:22:47] <Jong> breaking down arguments into perfect math?

[00:31:06] <Jong> If we optimize it for the greatest good for the greatest number, then isn't that the right goal to optimize for?
[00:31:54] <Jong> audrey AI uses a loss function. It's basically an optimization goal. The goal is to get the lowest number in the loss function
[00:32:48] <audrey> I think the question is way too open-ended, as posed, to offer any meaningful insight.

[01:55:58] <causative> I had the experience of sitting on a jury this week and last, and my takeaway at least for this jury is that people do not interpret "reasonable doubt" the way it's spelled - they vote based on what they think is more likely, they don't consider scenarios that may be 5% chances
[01:58:01] <causative> it explains something about the number of people in prison who are not guilty of the crimes for which they were convicted, e.g. see the Innocence Project
[01:58:41] <causative> if you ignore a 10% reasonable doubt that the defendant is innocent, you're going to convict an innocent defendant 10% of the time

[06:42:50] <causative> in a democracy I guess a jury trial is as good as we can practically get
[06:43:27] <causative> elected officials will be corrupt and biased, trained experts may become the same because political pressure would be applied to the expert-certifying process
[06:44:46] <causative> the selection of a jury is done by "sortition" - random selection from most of the population.  We'd be better off if more political offices were filled that way, or at least I'd like to see it tried.  It would at least eliminate the career politicians, and reflect the will of the people

[07:16:31] <audrey> I live in a county in the US that shall remain nameless ... where the councilmembers are routinely busted for graft every 5 or so years. It seems to be a pattern. Terms last 4 years, so a year after a corrupt councilmember gets reelected, he tends to get a little too relaxed and gets caught.
[07:17:21] <causative> the only solution is to build impersonal systems of accountability

[09:32:43] <audrey> The article (like a lot of content by UnHerd) barely scrapes the surface of this, but it's a reasonable starting-off point.
[09:32:57] <audrey> kmh: It beats me.
[09:33:09] <kmh> dunno the headline looks like a nostarter to me
[09:33:22] <kmh> nonstarter
[09:33:33] <audrey> Well, this looks like another case where the title was not chosen by the author
[09:33:35] <audrey> but rather an editorial decision
[09:33:44] <audrey> this is one of the things I dislike about UnHerd
[09:34:13] <audrey> The article itself I thought was rather interesting and in line with some of the broader sociopolitical trends we've been talking about.
[09:34:31] <kmh> ok
[09:34:59] <kmh> sowhat is thearticle actiually about?
[09:37:52] <audrey> The author's general argument is that universal, age-old taboos of this sort are being slowly eroded.
[09:38:26] <audrey> On second thought, I probably should have PM'd this to you, this probably isn't a great conversation topic for ##philosophy in general.
[09:41:50] <audrey> kmh: To go back to the earlier topic - the "End of History"  is a notion that historians have tried to apply throughout the 20th century. Remember the "War to End All Wars"?
[09:42:41] <audrey> There was a consensus circa 1919 that the era of major wars was over.
[09:42:58] <audrey> I see this as being very similar to the "consensus" (which was really just an illusion in the West) that formed in 1991.
[09:44:37] <kmh> well fukuyama did that most prominently
[09:45:15] <kmh> but imho it was never shared by majority of historians or political scientists
[09:45:28] <kmh> just prominently pushed by some outlets
[09:45:36] <causative> by necessity we will either have an end to major wars directly between world powers, or we will have global thermonuclear annihilation
[09:45:40] <causative> one or the other
[09:45:53] <causative> conventional wars between major world powers - nuclear powers - are no longer possible
[09:45:54] <kmh> and it was never grounded in evidence (just wishful projections)
[09:46:07] <causative> wars by proxy, e.g. korea, can still happen but not direct wars
[09:46:18] <kmh> causative,  na
[09:46:32] <kmh> we can also have forever proxy wars
[09:46:39] <audrey> "I love the smell of plutonium in the morning!"
[09:47:34] <kmh> and you never know what an accident, computer error, ai or nutso populist might trigger
[09:47:41] <causative> wars by proxy aren't "real" wars, because the survival of the world powers involved is not at stake
[09:48:02] <causative> you can't conquer a nuclear power
[09:48:03] <audrey> Nuclear war is only a matter of time, IMO. It's like Chekhov's Gun - if you see the gun in the first act, it will go off by the end of the third act.
[09:48:15] <kmh> causative,  they are possible as long they they do not resort to nuclear options
[09:48:20] <audrey> I'm just here to enjoy whatever time is left in between. :)
[09:48:28] *** Quits: Moyst_ (~moyst@user/moyst) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:48:37] <audrey> Well, depends what nuclear power we are talking about.
[09:48:40] <causative> kmh, the only reason wars by proxy are possible without resorting to nuclear options, is that the nuclear powers involved don't really care that much about the outcome
[09:48:49] <kmh> india and china didn't have a war but directly military confrontation at the border
[09:48:51] <causative> that's the only thing that stops nukes being used
[09:48:58] <kmh> so did Pakistand India
[09:48:59] <causative> and it's also what makes them not "real" wars
[09:49:03] <kmh> russia and china
[09:49:21] <audrey> At least four of the world's nine nuclear powers would probably be vulnerable to a first strike.
[09:49:25] <kmh> all nuclear powers at the time and direct military conflicts nevertheless
[09:49:28] <audrey> (Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, India.)
[09:49:51] <audrey> Of course, I don't think any rational military actor would take the risk.
[09:49:57] <kmh> and i can see a conventional war over taiwan
[09:50:35] <kmh> as well as conventional in eastern eukraine with or without nato involvement, same for the belarus border
[09:51:02] <causative> for the world powers involved, a war by proxy is more a playground for testing their fancy new military equipment, giving money to the well-connected, and raising morale for their army
[09:51:03] <kmh> lukashenko actually literally predicted/threatened war
[09:51:15] <audrey> There's also the possibility of a limited nuclear war (a term infamously coined by Kissinger)
[09:51:30] <audrey> It's really an unknown realm, militarily.
[09:51:40] <kmh> and nato (not just poland) in increasing troops in the border area and russia moving troops into belarus
[09:51:47] <audrey> I don't think anyone can predict what would happen in the event of a major conflict between great powers.
[09:52:20] <kmh> audrey,  the danger is unpredictable
[09:53:01] <kmh> from local skirmish (staying that way), a larger conventional confrontation to nuclear armageddon everything is possible
[09:53:02] <audrey> I do think it's notable that there have been no major, direct wars between great powers since the invention of atomic weapons.
[09:53:17] <audrey> Is there a correlation? I don't know, but I can't dismiss the possibility out of hand.
[09:53:29] <kmh> and with all those populists in power you can cannot expect rational reaction at any stage
[09:54:10] <kmh> and another issue probably a still increasing issue is technical failure triggering an exchange
[09:54:11] <audrey> If more nations were nuclear-armed, perhaps everyone would be too terrified to ever start another war. There's nothing like the threat of complete incineration to get even the most foolish politician or military commander to focus.
[09:54:15] <audrey> That's idle speculation on my part, though.
[09:54:23] <causative> the world is run by psychopaths, not idiots - they will ruin their economy and the climate for their personal enrichment, but they won't do something that results in their home city exploding
[09:54:51] <audrey> Either way, the genie is out of the bottle and nuclear weapons will never go away. That's, sadly, not how technological advancement works.

[09:55:26] <causative> it's all calculated kmh
[09:55:32] <kmh> causative, that aside i don't quite see why a sychopath would avoid a nuclear war
[09:55:51] <causative> because they don't want to explode

[09:56:33] <causative> none of the elites want that
[09:56:51] <kmh> so a psychopath might not see it as danger to his personally safety and being a psychopath he might not care about the rest

[09:57:17] <kmh> causative,  yes quality of life would be reduced

[09:58:23] <audrey> kmh: Nah, I don't care enough about humanity to go down that particular path of insanity.
[09:58:40] <audrey> I'm pretty fatalistic about this.
[09:58:53] <audrey> My interest is mostly as an outsider, looking in.
[09:59:28] <kmh> the problem with technology is that it becomes a race to fix problems it causes (and which can just be fixed via technology)

[12:33:24] <Ungwelian> We're specifically talking about statistical analysis here, regarding medical treatments.

[12:34:37] <Ungwelian> The question is specifically statistical analysis, regarding medical treatments.
[12:34:42] <Ungwelian> Don't move the goalposts.
[12:34:52] <causative> yes, and answer my question, because it pertains
[12:35:52] <causative> I'm not saying it's the *same* question - if I were, *that* would be moving the goalposts.  But I am not doing that.  I am saying it is a different, but highly pertinent question.
[12:36:48] <Ungwelian> Your claim is, that physicists know medical statistical analysis better than medical students, because they have training in mathematics.
[12:37:02] <Ungwelian> You haven't iterated at all on the mathematical requirements of medical students.
[12:37:18] <Ungwelian> And whether those are sufficient for statistical training in medicine.
[12:37:52] <causative> they have to pass the MCAT, which is pretty basic in mathematics content to a physicist, and med students have a reputation for just memorizing instead of really understanding
[12:37:57] <causative> now answer my question
[12:38:01] <Ungwelian> All the while doing this, you're disregarding science as an economic & social process.
[12:38:16] <Ungwelian> Which was my original point.
[12:40:11] <causative> in https://pastebin.com/jhyjd3TS there is a list of reasons why someone might refuse to answer a question
[12:40:11] <ro-bot-o> [url] Socratic dialoguesThe purpose of a Socratic dialogue is for the participants - Pastebin.com | pastebin.com
[12:40:28] <causative> which do you think applies to you here?
[12:41:44] <causative> I think that you actually agree that physicists are far more sophisticated about mathematics *in general* (without reference to statistics), but you're refusing to admit it because it would speak against your point
[12:41:55] <causative> this would be the reason of line 35

[17:18:48] <darklambda> if all of the raindrops are monocots and dicots.. oh, what a world it would be (tune)
[17:19:13] <arryana> it's to have two or more equally attractive and possible activities/events available to you at a given time.
[17:20:01] <arryana> and in a lot of ways, he was absolutely right
[17:20:41] <arryana> the driving concept behind it is to arrange one's life so that when a person isn't obligated to be busy doing something constructive, that they have options of things to spend their time on
[17:21:16] <arryana> i was 17 when he gave that lecture, so i've had a lot of years to gather things i like doing, so ephemeral stuff like games and media rarely make the cut of interesting-enough
