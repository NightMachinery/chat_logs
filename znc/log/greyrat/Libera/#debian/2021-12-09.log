[04:25:33] *** Joins: fjmorazan (~quassel@user/fjmorazan)
[04:26:14] <somiaj> I agree, but when upstream stops supporting it (nvidia stopped supporting it in 2019), not much we can do
[04:26:19] <somiaj> !antix
[04:26:19] <dpkg> antiX is a distribution <based on debian> that is designed to be run on older or low-memory systems. It uses sysvinit or runit in place of <systemd>. It is related to <mxlinux>. It is not supported in #debian. Support is available on their forum: https://antixforum.com. If you are new to linux, or want a distro with IRC support, try Debian instead: https://www.debian.org/intro/why_debian
[04:26:50] <somiaj> antix is not debian 10, they may have their own method to help patch/provide that package to the users, but debian will no longer be supporting it in bullseye onwards.
[04:27:07] <somiaj> seems some people have patched it to build against 5.10, but debian decided not to ship it
[04:27:43] <somiaj> oh and then there is the xorg abi too...anyways I agree that the non-free driver is better, but for older cards not much of an option if you want to run a current release
[04:28:50] <codex> i'm ok running old releases as long as they work

[07:51:25] <sceptttre> well, i pasted the specific ones. i didn't want to flood the note with the entire output is quite long lol
[07:51:33] <sceptttre> your call though. lmk if you want the entire output
[07:54:10] *** kveroneau is now known as Viewday12
[07:54:41] <sceptttre> I wonder if any of that is related to the fact that hdmi audio isn't working :/
[07:55:08] *** Viewday12 is now known as kveroneau
[07:55:50] <idioterna> sec
[07:57:45] <idioterna> sceptttre: nothing really important in these, one is an IOMMU unit that you're not using, which is OK, one is probably the TPM chip, which you also don't need, and one looks like a windows filesystem
[07:58:26] <idioterna> no, hdmi audio is related to your graphics driver, are you using ryzen's vega?
[07:59:30] <sceptttre> Mm, I'll google those words later since I have no idea what those things are. Now, a windows filesystem? What? How can that be possible? I built this computer myself and install debian first thing
[08:00:04] <sceptttre> idioterna not sure about ryzen's vega. i have an amd ryzen 7 5700g cpu
[08:00:37] <idioterna> yeah the g have builtin graphics, is your hdmi plugged into the motherboard's hdmi or do you have a separate one in the pci-e slot?
[08:01:02] <idioterna> you can use lspci | grep VGA to see
[08:01:09] <sceptttre> is "vega" the name of the builtin graphic "card"?
[08:01:36] <idioterna> yes, it would show something like this:
[08:01:37] <idioterna> 0c:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Renoir (rev d8)
[08:01:53] <sceptttre> 08:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Cezanne (rev c8)
[08:02:14] <idioterna> let me see what you need for that to work
[08:02:46] <sceptttre> i have only 1 hdmi port btw
[08:02:51] <idioterna> can you paste what "cat /proc/asound/cards" says?
[08:03:17] <idioterna> yeah the lspci would output two graphics cards if you had them
[08:03:23] <sceptttre> if you dont mind me asking, why did I grep VGA instead of HDMI just then?
[08:04:04] <idioterna> it's just what graphics cards are designated as
[08:04:18] <idioterna> lspci enumerates devices kernel found on the bus

[08:07:05] <idioterna> then you should be able to see HDMI in /proc/asound/cards

But bear in mind that you'll be installing <non-free> software.  These may have onerous terms; check the licenses.  See also <sources.list>.
[08:07:41] <idioterna> you'll likely have to add non-free
[08:07:41] <somiaj> they may have to enable non-free first, if they didn't select it during the installer
[08:07:42] <idioterna> yeah, that
[08:08:42] <idioterna> and i'm not sure when alsa probes, the easiest way may be to reboot if it doesn't just appear

[13:35:27] <Khepra> hegemoOn: 1) check if resolv.conf is a symlink into /run, then that's probably systemd-resolved controlling. 2) otherwise check if you have resolvconf package maintaining it; or 3) it's just set by dhcp which you can override (for dhclient see this: https://wiki.debian.org/resolv.conf
[13:36:14] <Khepra> And I think NetworkManager could have its fingers in the resolv.conf cookie jar too
[13:37:42] <jelly> !override dns
[13:37:42] <dpkg> To have dhclient etc not touch /etc/resolv.conf, the best plan is to configure it not to touch that file. See https://wiki.debian.org/resolv.conf for more details. Note that by ignoring the DHCP-provided DNS servers, you may find that you are unable to use captive portals or surf the web on some network. Beware creating technical debt by doing things like chattr +i

[20:37:18] <WantToHelp> does anyone know why after leaving my pc on for days firefox stops letting me tab to different windows in debian
[20:37:42] <somiaj> WantToHelp: are you using debian's firefox or a binary you got from elsewhere?
[20:38:05] <PerfDave> WantToHelp: What do you mean by "stops letting me tab to different windows in debian"?
[20:38:08] <WantToHelp> im using xfce and the firefox that came with the debian distro
[20:38:12] <somiaj> WantToHelp: also I'm a bit confused, I don't see why firefox would stop you from moving to different windows (do you mean any windows or just firefox tabs)
[20:38:22] <WantToHelp> firefox tabs
[20:38:42] <PerfDave> And when you say "stops letting me tab", do you mean with the keyboard, the mouse, or both?
[20:38:45] <Haohmaru> might be frozen
[20:39:06] <somiaj> maybe you have a tab open with a javascript memeory leak or something take up way to much memroy. I too have firefox sometimes act up and need to close the offending tab, but this is quite rare
[20:39:28] <WantToHelp> i mean with the mouse
[20:39:50] <WantToHelp> ill just click on a different tab and it doesnt respond
[20:40:04] <WantToHelp> but the computer isnt frozen because i can use terminals and other programs
[20:40:09] <somiaj> I would guess you have a tab open with a bad javascript app killing it
[20:40:15] <WantToHelp> :(
[20:40:16] <PerfDave> WantToHelp: Does running "top" or something show that Firefox is using an excessive amount of RAM or CPU?
[20:40:32] <somiaj> I've had firefox do this too, though it is quite rare, but it is often due to some poorly designed page. How many tabs do you have open?

[20:42:59] <somiaj> It could be due to cache and memeory ussage. I would think youtube's javascript is decent, but yea I only ever keep one tab open with youtube just to keep my memory ussage down

[23:21:11] <somiaj> So what was updated, there hasn't been a libreoffice update in a while. Are you using backports?

[23:22:31] <somiaj> GenTooMan: care to share the output of 'apt policy' and 'apt policy libc6 libuno-sal3 libreoffice-core'
[23:22:48] <somiaj> Anyways, libreoffice works jsut fine here, so wondering where a conflict might be.

[23:41:50] <somiaj> Two things, why armf sources on your system? Your cpu most likely can't run those binaries.
[23:42:33] <somiaj> though that is minor, I see your problem, you are mixing bullseye and bullseye-backports packages. libreoffice-core is from bullseye, while linbuno-sal3 is from bullseye-backports. Depending on your needs you may need to update to the backports version of libreoffice or downgrade libuno-sal3 to the bullseye version
[23:42:37] *** Quits: DirkS (~DirkSt@user/dirkst) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:43:05] <somiaj> but your sources.list looks a bit hard to maintain with how many things you hve there, be careful with third party sources, thoguh for this issue they aren't affecting it

[23:44:18] <GenTooMan> it's probably best to downgrade libuno-sal3 would it be best to uninstall it then reinstall?
[23:44:57] <somiaj> apt install foo=version can sometimes work. It migith depend on why that was updated to the backports version, it could be you have other parts of libreoffice using the backports version and are in some strange mix
[23:45:19] <somiaj> so you may have to play around to get things to using the libaries/binaries from either bullseye or bullseye-backports
[23:46:44] * GenTooMan thinks it couldn't have happened at a weirder time for him also.
[23:47:23] <somiaj> the easiest fix would just be 'apt install -t bullseye-backports libreoffice' and just upgrade everything to backports, but if you want to not use the backports version that will take more work
[23:48:00] <GenTooMan> I'll try and see what the easy way will do ...

[23:51:51] <GenTooMan> that was long but painless well I guess that is somewhat fixed.
[23:52:21] <GenTooMan> I say somewhat because well you never know :D
[23:52:51] <GenTooMan> thanks I noticed the libs but I couldn't think of how to "fix things"
[23:52:58] <somiaj> It should be fine
[23:53:17] <somiaj> backports packages are usually fairly sane, though there can be some problems as you have noticed
[23:53:35] <somiaj> but the problems is partly using backports and partly not for a specific set of software
