[11:05:03] <Tas-sos> I've a script that when ends return some exit codes, can I push/force it with some trick to return every time 0 ?
[11:05:13] <Tas-sos> with some pipeline ro something.. ?
[11:06:29] <rfm> Tas-sos, easiest would be to wrap in another script that runs the other script and then does exit 0..
[11:06:38] <katnis> installed locate, tried to update the database with sudo updatedb but it says permission denied :/ even tho i am root
[11:08:04] <rfm> Tas-sos, I suspect a script that did "otherscript || true" might do it \
[11:08:07] <Tas-sos>  rfm: Very nice idea, but this is not possible for me use case.. its need to execute exactly this script..

[11:31:26] <portmanteau> okay let me try that
[11:31:27] <alkisg> sudo apt purge snapd   (not snap)
[11:31:52] <portmanteau> so this USB drive I bought on eBay... can I use the non-persistent partition to refresh the persistent one?
[11:32:15] <portmanteau> okay cool I did not command and snapped was not removed because it was not installed
[11:32:52] <alkisg> (as I said in #linux, I won't answer that one, really, persistence is a completely different topic which it own problems, I really doubt some ebay seller got it right)

[11:39:17] <portmanteau> use htop to identify what is taking up the CPU
[11:39:19] <alkisg> OK anyway; regarding actions, you can have a `top` command running already to see what's causing this, and you could also uninstall snap in case that's  to blame

[11:40:12] <portmanteau> do you know why they added something in addition to apt?
[11:40:20] <alkisg> To see what kind of perstistence that person implemented, the commands are `mount` and `df -h` and `sudo lsblk --fs`
[11:40:25] <portmanteau> what can snap do that apt cannot?
[11:40:41] <alkisg> snap allows the vendors to send updates whenever they want
[11:40:47] <alkisg> While apt is managed by the distribution
[11:41:07] <alkisg> So e.g. a .deb firefox would be sent by canonical, and a .snap firefox would be sent by mozilla

[11:45:27] <rfm> so, gentoo is what you want, it's the fastest possible. start at https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Full/Installation

[13:46:37] <TJ-> katnis sort-of, yes. If an analogy will help think of a hard link as a 2 different addresses to the same house, and a symbolic link as a list of instructions as to how to get to the address

[14:09:20] <TJ-> katnis: most distros install GNU coreutils so all these are in ever install. if you want to see the files "dpkg -L coreutils | grep bin" to see just the binary files.

[17:38:01] <locsmif> Hi all. Does Ubuntu Hirsute ignore TLS minimum version settings in /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf because of the compile flag -DOPENSSL_TLS_SECURITY_LEVEL=2? This compile flag appears to have been added specifically in Ubuntu. However, the suggestion appears to be that it can be overridden in /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf
[17:38:23] <locsmif> But, no matter what I do to /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf, it has no effect

[17:39:19] <locsmif> In that, I e.g. test connecting to a server which supports TLS1.1, yet openssl's s_client fails. I've already asked in #openssl, but this appears to be Ubuntu-specific

[18:54:57] <jcbjoe2021> leftyfb: no I haven’t
[18:55:25] <leftyfb> jcbjoe2021: delete the user and try adding it through the GUI
[18:56:32] <jcbjoe2021> leftyfb: I can’t login through X with root or normal user. Only through a tty
[18:56:59] <leftyfb> jcbjoe2021: you can't login with any user? (you should NEVER EVER login as root onto a desktop)
[18:57:39] <jcbjoe2021> Yes I did a test only reason why I tried with root

[23:32:26] <ubottu> Ubuntu version numbers are: YY.MM (YY=release year,MM=release month). Each year sees two releases, so just specifying YY is imprecise. See also https://www.ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle
