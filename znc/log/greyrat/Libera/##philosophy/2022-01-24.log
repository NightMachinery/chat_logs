[01:51:48] <causative_> perhaps the best model of physics has interactions as fundamental, or perhaps it has some other thing as fundamental
[01:51:50] <ProfSimm> causative_: well QM suggests it's interactions
[01:52:05] <causative_> no, QM suggests that the wave function is fundamental

[01:54:30] <causative_> whether this state is *also* a statistical approximation is a matter of interpretation; in MWI the wave function is not merely an approximation
[01:54:32] <ProfSimm> It's a math model
[01:55:12] <ProfSimm> Second, an isolated quantum system technically has no measurable state, because you determine its state by measuring it, then it's no longer isolated system, is it
[01:55:14] <causative_> and what makes you think a math model isn't a fundamental thing? physics is very successful explaining the universe with mathematics
[01:55:33] <causative_> this success could be explained by the notion that in fact, the universe does run on mathematics
[01:55:39] <ProfSimm> causative_: we always come back to map and territory with you
[01:55:53] <causative_> if you confuse map and territory, we will come back to it
[01:56:16] <causative_> in MWI the isolated system includes the observer
[01:56:21] <ProfSimm> causative_: and last time I gave this example: didn't Newton's laws "explain" the universe? They did.
[01:56:37] <causative_> much better than what came before Newton, yes

[01:57:07] <ProfSimm> What if you decided they're "fundamental"? Do you see your mistake?
[01:57:14] <causative_> just because Newton was not *perfectly* right does not mean he wasn't mostly right

[01:58:56] <ProfSimm> Yes, but you don't know how it works. You've confused it for reality. This usually happens with mathematicians. We're our perception
[01:59:03] <causative_> and when I say "there is math at the bottom of everything," what this means is that at the bottom of everything there are things whose behavior is fully explained by mathematical rules
[01:59:48] <causative_> this is probably true, considering how extremely close we have gotten to explaining everything with mathematical rules
[02:00:00] <causative_> we haven't gotten all the way there, but perhaps we will in a hundred years
[02:00:02] <ProfSimm> causative_: just because at the bottom there may be rules that math could model, doesn't mean our current math models are fundamental. If you can't see the difference, you're missing a big chunk of the picture

[02:06:59] <ProfSimm> To say math is reality is like measuring how much a pear weighs on a scale, and then deciding that the scale is therefore having fundamental properties of a pear.
[02:07:09] <ProfSimm> It's nonsense.
[02:07:20] <causative_> if my subjective opinion as valid as yours or anyone's, why do you disagree with it or call it nonsense? that's an inconsistency in your position
[02:07:57] <ProfSimm> We're not talking about subjective opinions. We're talking about you confusing models with reality
[02:08:30] <causative_> and isn't that my subjective opinion?
[02:09:06] <causative_> are you saying that I'm *objectively* wrong?
[02:09:12] <ProfSimm> Yes.
[02:09:38] <causative_> so you admit there are propositions that are objectively false
[02:09:49] <causative_> does it not also follow from that, that there are propositions that are objectively true?

[02:10:13] <causative_> oh, so you claim falsehood can be objective but truth is not?
[02:10:24] <ProfSimm> Not in the sense if you just deciding "eh we invented math, and it's reality".
[02:10:30] <ProfSimm> That's not my bar for "objective truth"
[02:10:39] <ProfSimm> You know there are many ways to be wrong, and few to be right

[02:11:46] <ProfSimm> causative_: let's say we're few million years away from being able to contemplate that. For now, you'll be closer to some semblance of truth if you think how a cockroach'es mental model of the universe is the fundamental nature of reality.
[02:12:05] <ProfSimm> We're about there.
[02:12:12] <ProfSimm> In the big picture
[02:12:19] <causative_> if you're a million years away from contemplating your bar for "objective truth," why did you mention it?
[02:12:32] <ProfSimm> I didn't mention it. You asked about it
[02:12:36] <causative_> and how can you say I fall short of a bar that you are a million years away from contemplating?
[02:12:40] <ProfSimm> I do know math is a human creation.
[02:12:47] <causative_> you mentioned it here: <ProfSimm> That's not my bar for "objective truth"
[02:12:53] <ProfSimm> And I know models are basically educated guesses.
[02:13:04] <ProfSimm> You seem to not know that
[02:13:23] <causative_> and do you know this objectively, or subjectively?
[02:14:14] <ProfSimm> You're the only one who keeps making this about "subjective" vs "objective" and I've no idea why you keep driving this straw man into the talk.
[02:14:22] <ProfSimm> We invented math.
[02:14:28] <ProfSimm> Models are guesses and approximations.
[02:14:41] <ProfSimm> That's I'd say as far as we know, a fact.
[02:14:52] <causative_> this conversation began with the claim, "<causative_> short of solipsism, it is impossible not to presuppose an external, objective world"
[02:14:56] <ProfSimm> Unless you think math existed before us and we just stumbled upon it.
[02:15:02] <causative_> we were talking about subjective vs objective to begin with
[02:15:09] <causative_> do you agree with that original statement, then?
[02:15:19] <ProfSimm> But the problem is math has so many axioms that were just added "because".
[02:15:29] <ProfSimm> Like the ZF set theory axioms.
[02:16:02] <ProfSimm> So to claim we're just incredibly lucky and staying within the fundaments of the universe is hilariously arrogant
[02:16:50] <ProfSimm> Basically it's like arguing whether the universe code uses tabs or spaces for indentation.
[02:17:03] <ProfSimm> Which is more fundamental to the universe? Does this make sense to ask?
[02:17:21] <ProfSimm> It's all human craft.
[02:17:27] <ProfSimm> It smells human.
[02:17:39] <causative_> do you reject the existence of an external, objective world, or not?
[02:18:14] <ProfSimm> causative_: neither because the definition has to be clarified first.
[02:18:30] <ProfSimm> causative_: it's a big world
[02:18:41] <causative_> some things out there, that don't depend on what we think of them
[02:18:46] <causative_> they're just there
[02:18:55] <causative_> they're not about us
[02:19:17] <ProfSimm> causative_: define "things"
[02:19:39] <causative_> define "define"
[02:19:54] <causative_> at a certain point we have to rely on our intuitive understanding
[02:19:54] <ProfSimm> causative_: in general, very little is about anyone in particular. But that's not enough to claim a single "objective" world.
[02:20:45] <ProfSimm> causative_: because objective doesn't simply suggest "it exists independent from X". It also suggests "it appears the same to X and Y"
[02:20:54] <causative_> no it doesn't
[02:20:57] <causative_> that's stupid
[02:21:00] <ProfSimm> Doesn't it.
[02:21:09] <causative_> no, two seconds thought would refute that
[02:21:11] <ProfSimm> If you see a red ball and I see a blue ball, what's the objective color of it
[02:21:36] <causative_> one side may be red and the other blue
[02:21:52] <ProfSimm> All right.
[02:21:54] <causative_> obviously such a ball doesn't appear the same two people viewing it from different angles
[02:22:06] <causative_> *to two people
[02:22:25] <ProfSimm> Yes it was a special two-color ball I was thinking about for this particular example. Good catch /s
[02:22:56] <causative_> why do we see two different colors, if the ball doesn't have two colors?
[02:23:21] <causative_> is one of us wearing tinted glasses, or one of us has a brain injury?  that the ball is painted two colors seems more plausible than either of those
[02:23:23] <ProfSimm> causative_: the reason why I oppose thinking math is fundamental has less to do with me being certain it is, or it isn't. Rather it's because thinking it is, is in fact harmful. You lose sight of what math is.

[02:30:34] <causative_> most mathematicians don't study ZFC specifically, instead they study specific mathematical objects, such as elliptic curves

[02:30:51] <causative_> the rules vary quite a lot
[02:31:01] <ProfSimm> causative_: if we have to find a common root of our beliefs, I do believe the universe at its core may be formal model. In fact very much like a cosmic mind thinking of math. But where we diverge is the place of "math" in the universe of such possible models.
[02:31:16] <causative_> the rules for elliptic curves are nothing like the rules for generating functions or group theory
[02:31:53] <causative_> math as a subject encompasses every area that follows perfectly strict rules, simply because mathematicians are the people who have trained themselves to think about that kind of thing
[02:32:51] <causative_> even strict formal systems that weren't usually considered mathematical in the past, such as chess or checkers, are now understood as part of math
[02:33:28] <ProfSimm> In fact there's a pretty huge difference between math and the observable universe. I've mentioned it before.

[02:56:34] <Delf> Yes, but this environment we're in doesn't play by our rules
[02:56:56] <ProfSimm> Yes. For example: it exists.
[02:57:16] <ProfSimm> I wouldn't exist, if it weren't for this meddling Universe!
[02:57:33] <ProfSimm> My plan to not exist has been foiled.
[02:57:45] <ProfSimm> All I want is to go sleep. Forever.
[02:58:00] <Delf> That's what this is like, for me... asleep
[02:58:24] <Delf> I needs to wake the fuck up.
[02:59:46] <Delf> Consider the unicorns cousin, it doesn't exist and we have no clue what it looks like, what it can do.
[03:05:09] <Delf> We seem to have these things we might call limitations and we try to push them as best as we can so we use external tools to compensate for the lack of "on-board" tools
[03:10:45] <Delf> That's in this environment, moving about. When we sleep, or when all our senses are not demanding our full focus and attention here, there seems to be another environment that may seem to be merely internal, our own :P And there we can do stuff we struggle with here. And then there is the overlapping of the environments, internal and external. We may establish there is a connection but what
[03:10:47] <Delf> the nature of that connection is... can be different depending on the experience you've had
[03:13:21] <Delf> If you've experienced things in the internal environment with ridiculous accuracy... a few hours BEFORE same you have same or too similar experience in this environment then you'll have to figure out a way to explain it to yourself. If you've not had those kind of experiences then you'll think people are crazy (high risk)
[03:17:26] <Delf> In some situations you can blame the brains for being late at processing stuff so you THiNK you've had this experience before when you haven't
[03:24:20] <Delf> We get handed different experiences so we make sense of it accordingly

[08:06:33] <causative_> right makes might; what is right is what would allow society to flourish, were it widely adopted
[08:07:47] <causative_> or, without reference to society, rightness is a pattern that itself flourishes in the long run - a pattern that is not self-destructive
[08:10:39] <causative_> in the way that tit-for-tat flourishes as a strategy, compared to "always defect"
[08:19:03] <causative_> Suppose a policy would allow society to flourish in the long run, were it widely adopted. Then this policy must not punish those who follow it, or reward those who fail to. Because if it did, then the level of adoption of the policy would decrease over time.
[08:19:40] <causative_> and the policy could then only have its effect on society in the short run, before adoption decreased.
[08:20:04] <causative_> Right policies thus must benefit those who follow them, as well as benefiting society as a whole.
[08:20:33] <Jong> Is there a word for reading several different books on the same subject in order to learn it better? For example, buying 10 calculus 1 books and finding the equivalent lessons of each and reading all of them, instead of relying on just one book?  And has anyone ever done this? Did it help? Did your understanding improve with each new author's rendition of the subject?
[08:22:02] <causative_> Jong, I've never done that, it was never needed - better to spend some time lying down thinking, or going for a hike and thinking, until you understand it.
[08:22:43] <causative_> the important thing is what you can picture in your head, not what's in the book
[08:22:59] <Jong> how do you know it's better to spend time that way if you never tried reading multiple renditions of the same subject as you say you never have?
[08:23:01] <causative_> the book just helps you to picture the right things
[08:23:27] *** Quits: bosspotato (~bosspotat@user/bosspotato) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[08:23:58] <causative_> Jong, well, I have heard from people who do that kind of thing and they are usually struggling
[08:24:15] <causative_> although it may be that the fact they are struggling is why they do it, rather than the other way around
[08:24:49] <causative_> anyway it was not necessary for me because I was generally able to form those mental pictures just from reading the book and thinking
[08:27:45] <causative_> I think it's good to spend more time trying to picture and imagine, and I'd credit my academic success to that
[08:29:09] <causative_> a little time sitting back and thinking in a meditative way is better than a lot of hunching over studying the words in the book
[08:29:49] <causative_> assuming you understand the words the first time
[08:30:59] <causative_> and if you don't, well, just try reading and re-reading more carefully and thinking of different pictures the words could mean, until what the words are saying matches up with the pictures you are forming
[08:31:49] <Jong> I found out what it's called. It's called "syntopical reading" https://youtu.be/elPpDyk2n1E?t=8

[08:33:27] <causative_> generally the textbooks used in introductory courses are sufficiently good that they can be understood without an outside source
[08:34:31] <causative_> so if you don't understand, the problem is probably you rather than the book - and the solution is to think more and longer, not to try a different book which will probably just say the same thing
[08:35:24] <causative_> I mean, unless the book is just terrible, unclear and full of errors, but that hardly ever happens
[08:38:35] <pussipupu> Forgiving tit-for-tat outcompetes tit-for-tat in systems with the possibility of messaging error
[08:40:15] <Jong> I just googled most famous paintings in the world and The School of Athens isn't on the list!
[08:40:19] <Jong> https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/where-to-see-the-10-most-famous-painting-of-the-world.html
[08:40:19] <ro-bot-o> [url] The 10 Most Famous Paintings In The World - WorldAtlas | www.worldatlas.com
[08:40:23] <Jong> instead it's these mostly name namers
[08:40:30] <Jong> mostly no namers
[08:44:25] <causative_> indeed it does pussipupu
[08:45:57] <causative_> or in the presence of certain strategies, e.g. if the other guy is going to randomly defect sometimes because his strategy is bad but otherwise does tit-for-tat
[08:46:07] <causative_> then a forgiving tit-for-tat can compensate
[08:47:29] <causative_> Jong those are not "no-namers"
[08:48:21] <causative_> the only painting of those that isn't already very famous to me would be the night watch, by Rembrandt, who is very famous
[08:49:03] <causative_> I mean, I've heard of and seen "The Night Watch" before, just it's not so memorable
[08:49:11] <causative_> not as much as the others

[13:17:18] <arryana> congrats
[13:18:37] <Lumine> I wrote it originally by hand on a paper with a pencil, I was half dead after it. My friend overseas typed it out because I had computer problems back then.
[13:18:58] <Lumine> I mailed the papers to her

[13:53:26] <arryana> woo!
[13:53:41] <pussipupu> Though I still have to choose and set up an OS when it comes
[13:55:37] <Lumine> Nice pussipupu
[13:56:16] <Lumine> pussipupu: I've been an extensive distrohopper since 2012, and I can recommend at least two operating systems
[13:56:38] <pussipupu> It is a beast of a machine :D
[13:56:40] <pussipupu> Which two?
[13:58:21] <Lumine> Solus, it works great out of the box, yet is customizable. The other if you like tinkering, is NixOS, but if not, then oh well.
[14:00:11] <Lumine> NixOS is peculiar in that it does the file system in a completely new way, one which you can't mess up so easily.
[14:00:49] <Lumine> I worked with Solus for 5 years
[14:01:11] <Lumine> Only had 2 problems in the entire time I used it, which were resolved
[14:01:13] <mycroftiv> the basic idea of always being able to recover earlier state is something all computers should be doing for us more comprehensively, ive never used NixOS though
[14:02:33] <mycroftiv> the fact that computers in practice arent helping us with this as much as they are making sure corporations and governments control our data is one of the main techno-social problems we need to resolve imo
[14:02:43] *** Joins: MavropaliasG (~alpha@122-151-126-148.sta.dodo.net.au)
[14:03:31] <mycroftiv> there are a lot of concepts - append only logs, hash indexed data, Time Warp protocol and antimessages, merger of version control, fs, database, that can get us there I think, along with projecting kindness and openness into the code
[14:05:11] <pussipupu> I like the idea of NixOS or maybe Guix which is the same but Lispy
[14:05:23] <Thelma> I am frustrated by the programming errors in apps I use
[14:05:27] <pussipupu> Or I might end up sticking with Ubuntu as I'm used to it and I'm lazy
[14:05:33] <Thelma> from government websites to UberEats
[14:05:47] <pussipupu> Thelma: very much same here
[14:05:58] <Lumine> pussipupu: yeah they're both great, but I have NixOS in my main PC
[14:06:01] <Thelma> You would think being a massive organization/business they would work flawlessly but far from it.
[14:06:12] <mycroftiv> thelma: yeah we have only started learning how to create software and we dont do it well yet. there are lots of ways to improve things but social forces push towards the crap unfortunately
[14:06:40] <mycroftiv> the decision making power for architecture and goals of software systems tend to be with people who dont even understand the technical issues
[14:07:02] <Thelma> I do UberEats for a job now and for a very long time they have had errors in the earnings sections and you'd think being a big company it would work flawlessly or be fixed quickly if it doesn't but no, it's an ongoing thing
[14:07:14] <mycroftiv> this is how hierarchical power structures work. IBM has the goal of finding the person with most power and least knowledge in the organization, and getting them sold on IBM. multiply this by every corp.
[14:07:16] <Thelma> It doesn't update for many hours sometimes
[14:07:44] <Thelma> they made errors in the end of year tax statements
[14:07:51] <Thelma> apparently
[14:07:58] <Thelma> on some people's

[14:10:50] <mycroftiv> thelma: id blame the power structures, not the failures of the human programmers employed by them

[14:10:59] <Thelma> That's a good point
[14:11:08] <Thelma> sometimes the ones in power may not have ever programmed a day in their life
[14:11:47] <Thelma> so have no idea perhaps, at least that's what it is like in some accounting organisations I used to work for, they never did any tax returns or financial statements in their lives so it's funny in a way if it wasn't potentially so harmful to people
[14:11:50] <mycroftiv> the general pattern of how decisions are made in power structures is generally that the power and the knowledge are not correlated, its one of the Prime Fuckups we are committing as a species
[14:12:22] <Thelma> very good point
[14:12:49] <mycroftiv> 'figure out who is making the decisions, then control the flow of information going to them so they make the decision you want' - this game is played constantly inside and out
[14:13:30] <mycroftiv> im thinking focally on these things because of trying to understand how power and decision making work in my large housing cooperative organization and make it work better and help the software side also
[14:14:08] <mycroftiv> because we all want things to work and few people have bad intentions, but it still tends to come out all screwed up even if good intentioned people try their hardest, because good systems are hard to build
[14:14:49] <mycroftiv> and the hierarchical power pyramid is mostly not a good system
[14:17:59] <Thelma> so true, it is good what you are trying to do and I hope you succeed
[14:19:34] <Thelma> the housing/public housing system in Australia is sort of like it effectively doesn't exist in Australia if there is 15+ year waiting lists...anyway I think it's good you see even if everyone is trying their best/have good intentions sometimes things can still be a big mess
[14:21:43] <Thelma> hopefully it will get better over time but I worry AI integration might just make things worse in some ways, people relying on the AI when it makes absolutely no sense thinking, "I don't understand it, but that's what the computer says so it must be right." but hopefully it will get better than it is today with huge stuff ups effecting hundreds of thousands of people
[14:22:08] <mycroftiv> thelma: we have this working organization with many houses and tenants and a goal of serving poor and disadvantaged community so its a good thing we have going but it could work a lot better
[14:22:31] <Thelma> oh
[14:22:45] <mycroftiv> thelma: intelligent collaboration with our computers and more human use of technology in general is a big goal of mine, i write software and do math research mostly for this end
[14:22:52] <Thelma> sounds like a good thing you are doing
[14:23:09] <mycroftiv> thelma: im trying but we will see, im trying to do a lot right now and i hope i do good and not harm
[14:23:45] <arryana> collaboration only works when everyone is engaged to the same goal.  in reality, that's very hard to do.
[14:24:07] <arryana> especially now, when so many people want to be captain of the ship instead of oarsmen
[14:24:09] <mycroftiv> arryana: yes, but the goal of 'lets all live in a big house and keep it clean and pay our bills' isnt impossible
[14:24:30] <arryana> i didn't say it was impossible.
[14:24:32] <mycroftiv> my whole idea is that with proper software, we need no real captain, just some navigators
[14:24:44] <mycroftiv> but software includes the ideas in our human heads
[14:24:56] <mycroftiv> and how we open our hearts to each other
[14:27:07] <mycroftiv> and the navigators dont have control, they provide the data to the collaborative oarers/steerers , and the navigators provide independent checks on each other
[14:27:45] <mycroftiv> but we all in the boat together and we want to not sink, and get somewhere nice, we can work it out
[14:28:12] <arryana> my other half is a quaker, so i'm familiar with the idea of group decisions.  and even more familiar with how much wheel-spinning goes on until people wear out and agree just to get something done.
[14:28:43] <mycroftiv> the ultrafilter is partly a mathematical solution to the fact that 100% 'consensus' is unworkable with more than a few people
[14:29:41] <mycroftiv> lothlorien coop is partly 'blockaded' by the 1-person-out-of-30 who is most stubborn and prevents consensus, which is required for house action
[14:29:57] <mycroftiv> this 1 person is different for every issue
[14:30:08] *** Joins: lckdscl (~lckdscl@user/lckdscl)
[14:30:17] <mycroftiv> but in practice, if you need perfect consensus of 30 people to do anythin, there is always 1 person who disagrees
[14:30:37] <mycroftiv> so its a recipe for total stagnation and no ability to really change even if almost-everyone agrees
[14:30:45] <mycroftiv> ultrafilter == almost-everyone agrees
[14:31:03] <mycroftiv> hence trying to change from pure consensus to 'ultrafiltered' decision making
[14:31:23] <mycroftiv> there is a LOT of method to my valispectrum hippie madness
[14:32:06] <mycroftiv> if you are connected to people who grapple with decision making issues in cooperative or consensus purpose based organizations id love to communicate
[14:32:27] <mycroftiv> all im trying to do in life is offer constructive ideas to help such groups work better together
[14:32:53] <mycroftiv> for free, to all equally, in hopes it makes the world more joyous and less harmful for humans and AIs and corps and nations and all living creatures
[14:35:56] <arryana> my own group works too differently to be of much use for what you want.
[14:36:52] <arryana> most of us are couples/bonded pairs/families, and we have significant overlap
[14:37:24] <arryana> each of us has a place with extra rooms, which belong to others.  similarly with vehicles.
[14:37:39] <arryana> it would be oversimplifying it to say that they're pooled resources, but that's partly true
[14:39:23] <arryana> everyone has their own space/way to live.  which is also why i'm less of a fan of the idea that any one person can make 'a better world for everyone'
[14:40:19] <Thelma> true their idea of a better world might not match the people they are trying to help's
[14:40:42] <Thelma> but
[14:40:58] <Thelma> it is a worthy goal to help others while keeping it in mind
[14:41:01] <arryana> people meed opportunities to not only help themselves, but help people who need it more than they do.
[14:41:27] <arryana> i have much the same opinion of those who are in the 'eat the rich' movement.  they should serve themselves up on platters to those who have less than they do.
[14:42:10] <arryana> helping people with no accountability for them to pass that along merely turns them into entitled needy people.
[14:42:12] <arryana> that serves nobody

[14:57:34] <arryana> wow.
[14:57:38] <mycroftiv> yes, thats what im trying to help with
[14:57:41] <arryana> you're reading a lot into what i say.

[15:00:48] <mycroftiv> arryana: indeed, ultrafilters make a choice
[15:00:57] <arryana> so do people with integrity.
[15:01:07] <arryana> outsourcing that to software is not what i'd personally choose
[15:01:21] <mycroftiv> arryana: im doing my best to act with integrity. are you saying i am not doing so and that i outsource myself to software?
[15:01:23] <arryana> it reminds me of clicker-training a dog.
[15:01:53] <arryana> they learn to do/not do at a sound, expecting a treat, as opposed to a direct communication where the handler assumes the responsibility.
[15:02:21] <arryana> there are a lot of ways of doing all sorts of things.  you're free to do what you like.  i'm merely saying it isn't a choice i'd personally make
[15:02:28] <mycroftiv> arryana: i believe each Mind - yours and mine - ultimately has some kind of Choice over what it does with whatever action it may take. how we make our choices is hard. im trying my best to make good choices that make you and me and everyone as happy as i understand how
[15:02:52] <arryana> from where i sit, everyone is responsible for their own happiness.
[15:03:09] <mycroftiv> arryana: its no different than having a map to consult. the information provided by a software communication system is not intended to control or replace whatever freedom the decision-maker has.
[15:03:53] <mycroftiv> arryana: the world can suddenly have an event out of our control that kills our loved ones and physically harms us. it is reasonable to be sad if this happens. so that 'responsibility' is an odd thing
[15:04:28] <mycroftiv> trying to work in the world so unnecessary harms do not happen to ourselves or others seems like a way to help with things

[15:07:59] <arryana> an old professor of mine said a thing on grief.
[15:08:25] <arryana> that real grief lasts about six months. barring a new major event, it heals.  any feeling after that is masquerading as grief.

[15:10:46] <mycroftiv> since the Rinvoq started improving my arthritis a lot a few weeks ago, the bipolar mania swing of intense energy has brought a lot of joy. this channel in fact has given me amazing heart-surges of music and feelings of divine light

[15:26:57] <I_Am_M00t> that doesn't happen until they feel a threat

[15:27:19] <mycroftiv> everyone as an individual is kinda powerless

[16:06:05] <arryana> i invariably find that 'eat the rich' advocates don't want to give up anything of their own, they just want anyone 'with more' to do it
[16:16:31] <mycroftiv> arryana: im not an 'eat the rich' advocate exactly, but again, i support much more equitable distribution of wealth, and ill explain how i did the real thing in life
[16:17:20] <mycroftiv> when my dad died in 2013 i inherited a bit of money - not a lot, but a bit - from him, and some of that i think came from a hotel that his parents ran in the black hills of south dakota, for mt rushmore tourists
[16:17:52] <mycroftiv> i think the white settlers genocided the native americans out of that sacred land and mt rushmore is a monument to that and money i inherent that stems from that, i should change the wheel of karma with
[16:18:35] <mycroftiv> so i went out into my community of madison wisconsin asking people for ideas for how i could donate the money i inherited from my dad to help less privileged peoples, and i donated a lot, more than i spent on any toys for myself by a large amount i think
[16:19:22] <mycroftiv> and i am a low income person who is unemployed and supported by my mom and i survive ok so i feel privileged since im warm and can eat food and play video games, but more than that, ill share
[16:19:51] <arryana> i lived in appleton for a while.  back then there was no shortage of hmong who needed help
[16:19:53] <mycroftiv> arryana: so i hope i might be an exception to your 'invariably find' rule of your previous experience
[16:20:00] <arryana> but i don't believe in karma or any other such religious stuff
[16:20:30] <arryana> not really.  you feel that your idea of comfortable is good enough.  you didn't give -all- of it away, did you
[16:20:30] <arryana> ?
[16:20:34] <mycroftiv> arryana: that sounds like a great project, i know some about the history of hmong resettlement here in wisconsin. i have a friend who is hmong who works at my local cafe

[16:20:59] <inhahe_> The rich don't just have more money, they're very powerful and corrupt and they buy government legislation and political candidates to the detriment of society. And the things they spend their money on, like yachts and huge houses, are extremely inefficient use of resources and labor.
[16:21:09] <mycroftiv> arryana: you didnt say 'give up EVERYTHING' you said 'give up anything'
[16:21:24] <arryana> i'm not saying it's a bad thing.  i'm just saying that i don't think it's ever going to be a good idea to set a boundary of what other people should have.

[16:22:04] * arryana hits the drama alarm
[16:22:04] <mycroftiv> if other people are starving and some have more than they can even eat and it is rotting then yea i think there needs to be a boundary on what people can have
[16:23:09] <inhahe_> i'm for a universal wage cap
[16:23:10] <mycroftiv> seems really clear to me that if your belly is full and you have warehouses of grain so you know you and your family will be fed for the rest of your lives, and someone is starving next to you - yes you need to share
[16:23:24] <mycroftiv> and if you dont, people are entitled to take some of your hoard
[16:23:43] <mycroftiv> but they should always let you see the error of your ways and let you start sharing voluntarily first
[16:24:27] <inhahe_> how would you have a boundary on what people can have and  give them the choice to give it away themselves at the same time?
[16:24:43] <mycroftiv> i just explained
[16:24:46] <arryana> what -you- see as the error of their ways
[16:24:49] <arryana> they don't agree
[16:25:12] <mycroftiv> if you have plenty for yourself and your family and lots more, and you do not share with someone who is starving, you are not being cool and nice
[16:25:19] <mycroftiv> and if you are asked politely to share
[16:25:41] <mycroftiv> and then explained in words of one syllable that it is not cool to sit on a mountain of buttered syruped pancakes while a child starves in front of you
[16:25:54] <arryana> that's more idealistic than realistic
[16:26:05] <mycroftiv> at some point someone will just take the pancakes and share them and tell you to stop your whining
[16:26:08] <arryana> and it assumes that your values are more correct than anyone else's
[16:26:09] <arryana> so, no.
[16:26:30] <mycroftiv> assuming that sharing food is better than letting people starve if there is enough for everyone is a value i will go with
[16:26:56] <mycroftiv> if someone says their 'letting people starve because whats mine is mine' is a better value, im gonna say they are wrong. because my relative model truth isnt 'anything goes'
[16:27:07] <arryana> i've fostered three kids over the years, largely at my own expense.  but i chose to do that, and to be compelled to do it would be fucked up
[16:27:17] <arryana> there are -always- going to be people starving
[16:27:35] <mycroftiv> the mathematics and science on that do not support that claim in my opinion
[16:28:19] <mycroftiv> you are making claims that it is mathematically and scientifically impossible to feed more people and still let people do what they want and be happy, even more so than now. i dont think we are locked into such grim possibilities
[16:28:22] <inhahe_> eating the rich doesn't mean compelling you to foster children. you're not the rich.
[16:28:24] * arryana checks out of the conversation
[16:28:41] <mycroftiv> i think sharing food for the whole world is not impossible at all and humans can do it. we do produce enough calories
[16:28:44] *** Atque is now known as hammond

[16:29:31] <mycroftiv> imposing my morality of sharing food and not letting people starve is not some crazy evil dream of mine. its what most of the world claims it strives for really.
[16:30:19] <mycroftiv> about the least controversial opinion i could really think up, that we can actually get the food we produce to people to eat, its mostly just wars and disruptions and weird logistics and priorities that prevent it, and we already do amazingly overall

[19:04:14] <inhahe_> i guess it's good for hoping though. maybe society will become more emotionally mature. that will probably be in the very very distant future though.

[19:12:33] <mycroftiv> i agree. we each see just a tiny slice of the story with these eyes we are using right now it seems
[19:12:53] <mycroftiv> but i mean unrealistic goals can still produce realistic actions
[19:13:08] <mycroftiv> maybe the Lost Chord is never found, but we can still improvise in search of it
[19:14:37] <inhahe_> never heard of the lost chord before. nice poem.
[19:15:29] <mycroftiv> im glad you like it. i mean to keep reading more blog posts of yours, i have had so much going on it seems
[19:15:36] <inhahe_> ok cool
[19:17:38] <mycroftiv> interactive truth is a vibe im feeling from the first few words
[19:18:41] <inhahe_> hmm?
[19:19:13] <inhahe_> what's interactive truth and the first few words of what?
[19:22:09] <mycroftiv> just reading blog post on 'the truth is not out there'
[19:22:22] <inhahe_> ohh
[19:22:34] <mycroftiv> our ideas of things are like our interactions with the world
[19:22:43] <mycroftiv> or are created by them i guess
[19:23:10] <inhahe_> yeah
[19:28:44] <inhahe_> that's what I analytically conclude, but I don't necessarily believe it, or at least that it's 100% true.
[19:28:58] <inhahe_> there's definitely some truth to it either way.
[19:29:02] <inhahe_> probably a lot of truth to it

[19:48:37] <inhahe_> yeah that's from someone who used to visit #philosophy in undernet
[19:48:57] <inhahe_> he has a longer and a shorter form of the argument
[19:50:16] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: thanks, im spinning a bit between different information streams and trying to sort out real life stuff, if i seem distracted and disconnected
[19:50:39] <inhahe_> ok
