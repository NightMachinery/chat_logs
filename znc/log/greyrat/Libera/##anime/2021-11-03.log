[00:38:58] <Berlin36> ye
[00:39:02] <Roey> oh, ok.
[00:39:08] <Berlin36> there is no such letter in the romanian alphabet
[00:39:08] <Roey> my grandmother came from Romania
[00:39:19] <spoonm> Roey: I don't, but it's meant to be a Romance language, no?

[00:40:15] <spoonm> boa tarde
[00:40:21] <Berlin36> sometimes i can understand a bit of spanish and italian because they sound simillar with romanian in some ways xD
[00:40:25] <Roey>  *tarde, boa tarde, thanks
[00:40:27] <Berlin36> but not always ofc
[00:40:32] <Roey> ah
[00:40:43] <Roey> Berlin36: and of course you undertsand Moldovans
[00:40:49] <Berlin36> well yeah
[00:40:57] <Berlin36> lol
[00:40:59] <Roey> :)
[00:41:14] <Berlin36> if ill send you a moldovan rap music
[00:41:17] <Roey> what's it like, knowing how to conjugate a verb according to a HUGE table?
[00:41:28] <Berlin36> most likely nobody besides moldovans will understand it
[00:41:32] <Roey> I seen that verb conjugation table for Romanian
[00:41:35] <spoonm> do either of you know the saying risus abundat in ore stultorum ?
[00:41:37] <Roey> *wow* it's large.
[00:41:42] * Jigsy blushes.
[00:41:43] <Roey> spoonm: I do not
[00:41:43] <Jigsy> T-Thanks.
[00:42:02] <Berlin36> moldovans tend to use russian words a lot 
[00:42:10] <Berlin36> so it happens that i know russian too
[00:42:19] <Roey> al the romanians I've met know some russian
[00:42:28] <spoonm> it means (roughly) "there's plenty of laughter in the mouth of fools"
[00:42:28] <Roey> all*
[00:42:36] <Roey> Berlin36: do you know any transylvanians?
[00:42:42] <Berlin36> but some of us try to speak clear romanian, though with a much different accent from romanians
[00:42:47] <Berlin36> no, Roey
[00:42:49] <Roey> do they have an accent of their own?
[00:42:49] <Roey> ah
[00:42:55] <spoonm> I can parse 'risus' for laughter, 'abundat' for 'plentiful', but ore stultorum doesn't give me anything
[00:43:13] <Roey> oh, stultory
[00:43:26] <spoonm> stultory?
[00:43:28] <Roey> or maybe sultry
[00:43:29] <Roey> hot
[00:43:29] <spoonm> is that a word in Romanian?
[00:43:35] <Roey> Very humid and hot.
[00:43:36] <Berlin36> what word
[00:43:43] <Roey> stultorom
[00:43:56] <spoonm> I'm thinking maybe there are cognates to 'ore stultorum' in Romanian
[00:44:03] <Roey> ah.
[00:44:03] <spoonm> so thought of consulting you
[00:44:12] <spoonm> (it comes from Latin, btw)
[00:44:38] <Berlin36> um
[00:44:40] <Berlin36> idunno
[00:44:41] <Berlin36> but
[00:44:53] <Berlin36> i tried translating it to romanian (from latin)

[00:45:22] <Roey> you guys drink israeli coffee, figured you might know israeli music :)
[00:45:23] <Berlin36> it says something like this: gura nebunilor, which is "mouth of the crazy" if trasnslated literally???
[00:45:32] <Berlin36> i don't, Roey
[00:45:51] <spoonm> Roey: I do!

[00:46:38] <Roey> cool cool :)
[00:46:49] <Berlin36> i mainly listen to music that is in english
[00:46:54] <Roey> spoonm: wait how do you know Ribo's music?

[00:57:47] <Berlin36> they have a "clearer" romanian
[00:57:50] <Roey> ok
[00:57:53] <Berlin36> and
[00:57:54] <Berlin36> also
[00:58:03] <Berlin36> moldovans use a lot of russian words
[00:58:07] <Roey> right
[00:58:14] <Berlin36> and modify them and also it gets pretty wrird

[00:59:32] <MootPoot> I get paid tommorow
[00:59:33] <Roey> what they wear
[00:59:33] <Roey> ?
[00:59:39] <Berlin36> majority of moldovans speak romanian clear too, but it's still not the same as romanians from romania
[00:59:44] <Roey> ooh and MootPoot gets paid tomorrow! Life gets better and better!
[00:59:53] <Roey> Berlin36: aye
[00:59:54] <Berlin36> Roey, well Moldova is a pretty poor country
[01:00:01] <Roey> that I heard yes
[01:00:10] <Berlin36> and also, sometimes you can see some consequences of ussr and stuff
[01:00:17] <Roey> like which consequences
[01:00:20] <MootPoot> but all I'm going to do is to pay off my credit card then dump all the money I have left into my student loans
[01:00:25] <MootPoot> rip
[01:00:26] <Roey> oh the architecture of the buildings, Berlin36?
[01:00:26] <Berlin36> romanian is a more european country
[01:00:36] <Berlin36> about that i can't really tell
[01:00:36] <Berlin36> but
[01:00:39] <Roey> MootPoot: ya
[01:00:41] <Roey> Berlin36: ya
[01:00:43] <Berlin36> i've been to romania a few times
[01:00:45] <Berlin36> and
[01:00:47] <Roey> aye
[01:00:54] <Berlin36> sometimes it's pretty much the same
[01:00:59] <Berlin36> i speak about villages and stuff
[01:01:08] <Roey> btw I would love to go to the Transylvanian countryside
[01:01:14] <Roey> I hear it's very pretty there
[01:01:23] <Berlin36> but cities in moldova are small and sometimes you can still see old ussr 5 floored buildings
[01:01:26] <Berlin36> or 9 floored
[01:01:30] <Roey> eeesh!!
[01:01:33] <Berlin36> romania is more modern
[01:01:36] <MootPoot> are the girls cute
[01:01:46] <Berlin36> ye, that definetely ^
[01:01:49] <Roey> :D :D
[01:01:56] <MootPoot> will the moldovan accept a fat moose person
[01:02:07] <Berlin36> idunno, im really attracted to girls from my country xD

[01:02:27] <Berlin36> Roey, i was in Transylvania once
[01:02:35] <Berlin36> that fancy castle and stuff
[01:02:45] <Berlin36> it's beautiful there
[01:02:46] <Roey> ya
[01:02:54] <Roey> I keep thinking in my mind of a valley
[01:03:03] <Roey> is that what it looks like, a valley, between mountains?
[01:03:10] <Berlin36> well
[01:03:12] <Berlin36> kind of
[01:03:14] <Roey> ok
[01:03:25] <Berlin36> well don't expect to see a castle in the middle of nowhere
[01:03:30] <Roey> ok
[01:03:30] <Berlin36> there is like a small city around it 
[01:03:33] <Roey> right
[01:03:46] <Roey> I mean there were a Jewish communities in Transylvania
[01:03:50] <Berlin36> it's more like a tourist city full of shops and stuff near the castle
[01:03:53] <Roey> ya
[01:04:03] <Roey> I mean yes yes yes Dracula yes yes how many times do we have to acknowledge it
[01:04:06] <Roey> right? :)
[01:04:09] <Berlin36> xd
[01:04:19] <Berlin36> the castle itself is *okay*
[01:04:20] <Roey> but like I want to see the region beyond all that hype
[01:04:22] <Roey> ok
[01:04:26] <Berlin36> i liked more the Peleș Castle
[01:04:39] <Roey> where was Peleş Castle?
[01:04:39] <Berlin36> it's bigger and more beautiful imo
[01:04:48] <Roey> oh they keep it in shape?

[01:05:19] <Berlin36> yes
[01:05:31] <Berlin36> the interior is also beautiful and it's like a reservation
[01:05:43] <Berlin36> no other buildings around it 
[01:05:49] <Berlin36> i mean there are a few for sure

[01:31:27] <Berlin36> you can do it lmao

[01:36:21] <Berlin36> anddd what capacity do you set it to usually
[01:36:22] <Berlin36> because
[01:36:29] <Duns_Scrotus> Depends
[01:36:30] <Berlin36> it might act weird when changing them

[01:37:51] <Berlin36> and do you use Printf usually? or Println  or just Print
[01:38:07] <Duns_Scrotus> Because all the libraries and functions expect slices
[01:38:25] <Berlin36> yeah, you can do pretty much everything with a slice the same as with an array?
[01:38:33] <Duns_Scrotus> Yes
[01:38:39] <Berlin36> i see

[01:50:47] <Berlin36> pointers are still confusing to me
[01:51:07] <snake> Berlin36, pointers are confusing for all beginners
[01:51:20] <Duns_Scrotus> You just need to think in terms of how the computer works
[01:51:29] <Berlin36> i tried ;-;
[01:51:33] *** OERIAS2 is now known as OERIAS
[01:51:42] *** OERIAS is now known as CristobalColon
[01:51:43] <Duns_Scrotus> And then pointers are simpler than like, python semantics
[01:51:51] <Berlin36> xd
[01:51:53] <snake> yeah a pointer is just an address
[01:51:55] <snake> or just a number
[01:52:00] <Berlin36> yes
[01:52:02] <snake> using them can get confusing with all the symbols
[01:52:03] <Berlin36> i know that
[01:52:13] <Berlin36> yee but
[01:52:17] <Berlin36> when sould i use the
[01:52:19] <Berlin36> m
[01:52:33] <snake> hmm, well you can use them for a few things
[01:52:43] <snake> im currently trying to use them for information hiding in go
[01:53:00] <snake> (related to encapsulation sorta)
[01:53:08] <Berlin36> oh
[01:53:28] <Duns_Scrotus> if you want a function to modify its argument, if you want to pass a large struct as an argument without copying the whole fucking thing
[01:53:42] <Berlin36> oh yeah exactly
[01:53:48] <Berlin36> i ve used pointers only once
[01:53:55] <snake> Duns_Scrotus, actually copying a whole struct might not be so bad
[01:53:57] <Duns_Scrotus> If you want the property where multiple places have a pointer to the same thing, and changing it is visible through all the pointers
[01:54:01] <Berlin36> to not copy a fucking array when i wanted to change somethinf
[01:54:29] <Duns_Scrotus> snake: yeah probably not, especially since passing pointers defeats the escape analysis
[01:54:47] <snake> idk what the escape analysis is
[01:54:54] <Berlin36> fuckingArray := []int
[01:54:55] <Berlin36> b := &fuckingArray
[01:55:05] <Berlin36> lile this?
[01:55:40] <Duns_Scrotus> snake: if you don’t take a pointer to a struct, it can be allocated on the stack instead of the heap, and doesn’t need to be garbage collected later
[01:55:47] <Berlin36> now b will basically just point to the fuckingArray
[01:56:04] <snake> Duns_Scrotus, ah yes
[01:56:07] <snake> i get that
[01:56:16] <Duns_Scrotus> There also other fancy optimizations that enables but idk if the go compiler does them
[01:56:17] <snake> Berlin36, r u ok
[01:56:25] <Berlin36> not really
[01:56:33] <snake> Berlin36, you could learn java, its easier
[01:56:39] <snake> :V
[01:56:40] <Berlin36> n o p e
[01:56:43] <snake> o k
[01:56:49] <Berlin36> java doesn't attract me
[01:56:52] <Duns_Scrotus> Java is definitely not easier than go
[01:56:53] <snake> i am using java at uni, its awesome
[01:56:55] <Berlin36> it doesn't have a cute mascot
[01:57:01] <Berlin36> xd
[01:57:08] <snake> next semester we're diving into C
[01:57:15] <Berlin36> nice
[01:57:23] <snake> oh wait not me tho, i am behind xD
[01:57:26] <snake> part time student
[01:57:30] <snake> ;-;
[01:57:33] <Berlin36> i once tried to learn x86_64assembly
[01:57:38] <Berlin36> it was pretty fun
[01:57:44] <Berlin36> but it requires a lot of time
[01:58:22] <Berlin36> also loops are crazy cool in assembly 
[01:58:30] <Berlin36> and if else conditions
[01:58:44] <CristobalColon> I think I have landed in Cathay!
[01:58:51] <CristobalColon> time to bring out the men!
[01:58:54] <Berlin36> but numbers are not fun in assembly-_-
[01:59:44] <Berlin36> it was pretty hard to print a number there
[01:59:57] <snake> Berlin36, idk honestly, the cup of coffee logo is kinda appealing to me
[02:00:03] <snake> but im not pressing you, just noting that
[02:00:13] * snake sips
[02:00:29] <Berlin36> it reminds me of the times when i had an old phone that runned on java and had like 2 games
[02:00:42] <Berlin36> uknow those phones that had...BUTTONS!!!!

[02:44:03] <amigojapan> omero: technically you are not supposed to take any pictures of strangers Withought their permission in Japan
[02:44:12] <omero> really?
[02:44:32] <ButterNoodle> ever notice all the faces are blurred on google street view?
[02:44:35] <ButterNoodle> thats why
[02:44:36] <omero> a beach is a public place.
[02:44:40] <viper1829> tbf i wouldn't want anyone taking random photos of me
[02:44:44] <viper1829> even if it were accidental
[02:44:57] <viper1829> idk that's just me though
[02:45:02] <omero> and stop me then...
[02:45:26] <omero> technically isnt stealing if you arent caught doing it ;)
[02:45:37] <ButterNoodle> camera on ur shoe
[02:45:39] <ButterNoodle> fixes that
[02:46:21] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: that is not for taking pictures of faces
[02:46:23] <omero> how about a phone in the front of your jacket...
[02:46:51] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: so that means its ok
[02:47:05] <omero> c'mon... we of KGB did that back like 60 years ago...
[02:47:06] <ButterNoodle> *not taking pictures of faces is ok...
[02:47:06] <amigojapan> omero: oh, it is also illegal to mute the camera shutter sound
[02:47:28] <ButterNoodle> no shutter in video mode tho
[02:47:33] <omero> sure...
[02:48:08] <omero> like one can hear the shutter sound... 
[02:48:23] <omero> on a beach, full of peoples
[02:49:06] <amigojapan> omero: you can on the train
[02:49:33] <omero> really?
[02:49:42] <amigojapan> Yes
[02:49:53] <amigojapan> It's very quiet on trains
[02:49:54] <omero> are all peoples sitting in religious silence?
[02:50:07] <amigojapan> For the most part yes
[02:50:13] <omero> sad
[02:50:36] <ButterNoodle> you'll get stern looks if u make noise on the train
[02:50:42] <omero> very very sad... no interactions at all?
[02:51:06] <omero> c'mon ... its a train! not a cemetery...
[02:51:16] <amigojapan> It's only technically against the rules to talk on the phone tho
[02:52:32] <omero> that would get a hard glare from me -.- talking on the phone? ah... now that is real rude... 
[02:52:59] <omero> that would really disturb me. 
[02:53:55] <omero> especially when you have it on 'speaker' for everyone else in that compartment to hear... its so annoying.
[02:54:01] <amigojapan> omero: and in the priority seats you are supposed to give up your seat to people who need it
[02:54:41] <omero> amigojapan: that rule exists here since before WWI
[02:54:48] <omero> on any public transport
[02:54:50] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[02:55:15] <omero> you are to give place
[02:55:30] <omero> and remove your hat while doing so
[02:55:39] <amigojapan> Hehehe
[02:55:46] <omero> if you were wearing a hat, that is
[02:55:49] <omero> it is polite
[02:56:00] <omero> Im serious
[02:56:56] <omero> and also in queue at the mini-super-hyper-market, you are supposed to ... behave.
[02:57:30] <amigojapan> omero: I wore a hat recently during the summer, but I was not sure if I had to remove it when speaking to people anymore or if that is an obsolete rule
[02:57:34] <omero> respect the ones that are carrying the life, and have been through the days.
[02:58:40] <omero> I do not wear hats, never did, unless its raining. its me, amigojapan ... but I still make the gesture.

[05:03:38] <snake> !memo Berlin36 hey, here is that code i was working on. this demonstrates the most ADT you can get from golang. pointers are not so good for this after all, but instead, you want to just let the unexported fields be "hidden enough" https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/67c33580478f44e48f62c2862ef6aa9d

[05:10:36] <MootPoot> sometimes there are telltale signs like sweating / vomiting / fever as well
[05:10:55] <MootPoot> but if it lasts more then a typical stomache, I'd go to the doc and ask
[05:11:10] <MootPoot> stomaches uaully last what, 4 hours?
[05:11:29] <amigojapan> I see, I had to go to the bathroom with diahreah three times this morning
[05:12:08] <MootPoot> uhoh , amigo bakhatsu
[05:12:13] <MootPoot> lol
[05:12:13] <amigojapan> I need to go home today. It would be hard to go to the doctor
[05:12:25] <MootPoot> do you have a fever?
[05:12:28] <MootPoot> sweating? 
[05:12:30] <amigojapan> No
[05:12:37] <MootPoot> its just today?
[05:12:43] <amigojapan> Yes
[05:13:02] <MootPoot> eh, dont eat anything, drink a LOT of water / sports drink
[05:13:15] <amigojapan> Ok
[05:13:31] <MootPoot> wait it out, if its not gone or significantly less painful then I'd go to the doc
[05:13:47] <MootPoot> make sure to keep drinking water 
[05:14:06] <MootPoot> diareeha is literally making you shit out water - its going to feel much worse when you're dehydrated

[05:19:34] <amigojapan> Yes you can

[05:20:33] <MootPoot> uh
[05:20:41] <viper1829> all you really need to do in order to multitask when using the cli is to open a bunch of terminals on your desktop

[05:21:28] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I thought you were taking about multithreading
[05:21:45] <amigojapan> MootPoot: multi task is possible
[05:21:50] <viper1829> i mean it's pretty obvious that multithreading is possible in the cli
[05:22:14] <viper1829> if it wasn't, then i'd probably want to toaster bath after trying to compile a single application
[05:22:21] <amigojapan> viper1829: he said in bash
[05:22:41] <MootPoot> the bash cli
[05:22:47] <MootPoot> or is bash and bash cli different
[05:23:00] <amigojapan> MootPoot: multithreading is not multitasking
[05:23:11] <viper1829> bash is the shell for the cli
[05:23:18] <MootPoot> yeah but I asked for multitasking
[05:23:22] <MootPoot> not multithreading
[05:23:23] <viper1829> there are plenty of other shells such as ash or zsh
[05:23:32] <amigojapan> MootPoot: bash is both a shell and a programming language
[05:23:53] <amigojapan> MootPoot: your question was not clear
[05:24:02] <MootPoot> so I can beep boop in the cli, or write bash beep boop in a file which I run, which when executes in the background 
[05:24:30] <viper1829> i'm kind of confused about your question
[05:24:57] <amigojapan> MootPoot: if all you want to do is multitasking open many terminals
[05:25:08] <amigojapan> viper1829: me too
[05:25:17] <MootPoot> I SSH into my linux , I make it do a thing ( host  a server ). Now I can't do anything else on that terminal without closing it and shutting down the server
[05:25:35] <MootPoot> the way to do other things on the server is to open multiple terminals under the same user account?
[05:25:54] <amigojapan> MootPoot: run your program with an & at the end of the command line
[05:26:14] <viper1829> MootPoot: you can also create shell scripts to automatically do commands
[05:26:23] <amigojapan> MootPoot: server parameters &
[05:27:03] <amigojapan> MootPoot: that will set the server into the background
[05:27:41] <MootPoot> oh really
[05:27:49] <MootPoot> then how do you bring it back to the foreground
[05:28:12] <viper1829> uhh
[05:28:22] <viper1829> are you trying to troll in this channel?

[17:57:28] <emmeka> zoidberg I watched Adventure Time as it aired starting from the first season.
[17:57:50] <zoidberg> oh yeah, sorry, it was someone else then
[17:57:52] <emmeka> I haven't gotten around to watching Distant Lands yet.
[17:58:11] <emmeka> I still think it's basically the greatest western animation of all time
[17:58:43] <zoidberg> one of the greats
[17:59:56] <emmeka> zoidberg for something recent, have you watched Primal? from the creator of Samurai Jack & Dexter's Lab. It's pretty fantastic, and not for children.
[18:00:44] <zoidberg> nah, I'll give it a go. 
[18:01:32] <Sxem> i liked primal a lot
[18:01:34] <zoidberg> emmeka: In the recent animations, I watched gravity falls, disenchantment, rick
[18:01:40] <Sxem> no script, but it didnt need one
[18:01:43] <zoidberg> rick and morty*
[18:02:33] <emmeka> Sxem it has such excellent choreography. as far as animated action scenes, it's the best I've seen.
[18:02:47] <Sxem> oh wow, distant lands s01e04 came out 2 months ago and i didnt notice
[18:03:04] <emmeka> Sxem did you hear there's a new Adventure Time spinoff greenlit, too
[18:03:11] <emmeka> they're doing a full Fionna and Cake series.
[18:03:33] <Sxem> nice
[18:03:38] <emmeka> literally went from fanart/fanfiction to inside joke within the show, to full series.
[18:03:41] <Sxem> ive seen all of adventure time
[18:04:17] <Sxem> gravity falls is too much of a kids show for me
[18:04:38] <Sxem> adventure time is a kids show, too, but it seems more adult to me
[18:04:44] <emmeka> I'm still sad that Infinity Train got cancelled at such an inoppourtune time.
[18:04:59] <emmeka> it was pretty great, from someone who worked on Adventure Time

[18:06:25] <Sxem> i watch Infinity Train too. didnt know it got canceled
[18:08:32] <emmeka> yeah, season 4 was the last. which is sad because part 5 was supposed to answer most of the lingering questions about the train
[18:08:53] <emmeka> storyboarding for it is apparently done and everything

[22:06:08] <Berlin36> php seems hard to learn
[22:06:10] <KatrinValerie> Berlin36: I would, but my room is a mess and I am to embarrassed to show it
[22:06:17] <Nanobot> PHP is one of the easier languages to learn, IMO
[22:06:18] <Berlin36> idk why, but php scares mee
[22:06:31] <KatrinValerie> Just don't try to do OOP
[22:06:32] <Berlin36> KatrinValerie lol, relatable 
[22:07:00] <Nanobot> PHP is heavily OOP these days.
[22:07:06] <KatrinValerie> Nanobot: it can get a bit complex and I found the documentation to be poor
[22:07:18] <Berlin36> php's used for sites, right?
[22:07:30] <Nanobot> PHP's most common use is websites, yeah
[22:07:35] <KatrinValerie> Nanobot: did they go C# style or more like C++?
[22:07:48] <KatrinValerie> I just remember the old classes style that resembled C++ or Java
[22:07:50] <Nanobot> KatrinValerie: Java
[22:08:47] <Nanobot> PHP has always been designed around taking ideas from other languages and cobbling them into PHP
[22:08:50] <KatrinValerie> Nanobot: I recently came to dislike OOP a bit, it often overcomplicates things and you rarely really need class hirarchies
[22:09:45] <KatrinValerie> And let's not get me started on how the gang of four lead to a nightmare of spaghetti code
[22:09:52] <Berlin36> xd
[22:10:08] <Berlin36> idunno, how do people write big code without oop?
[22:10:19] <KatrinValerie> When you need a factory class to initialise an object you should start to wonder where you fucked up
[22:10:24] <Berlin36> because i didn't really code in oop too much
[22:10:52] *** Quits: digin4 (~digin4@user/digin4) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:11:28] <KatrinValerie> Berlin36: modularisation is usually the only tool you need to structure your code
[22:11:52] <Urchin[emacs]> KatrinValerie: which doesn't require OOP
[22:11:56] <hans> PHP is a great language. like how PHP has a date-format constant called DateTIME::ISO8601, which is literally incompatible with ISO8601
[22:12:00] <KatrinValerie> Urchin[emacs]:exactly
[22:12:20] <Berlin36> lol hans
[22:12:52] <KatrinValerie> OOP makes sense when you need to treat objects of different types as the same, but you can easily do the same procedurally

[22:16:24] <hans> also in PHP, functions can typed return values, like a function can be typed to return int|false  - but ofc, it's illegal to return int|true
[22:16:25] <Berlin36> idk how to really write in C
[22:16:29] <hans> can have*
[22:16:51] <Berlin36> i mean it would be easy for me to learn as it is almost the same as c++?
[22:16:52] <hans> (that's a very recent addition, php>=8)
[22:17:05] <Berlin36> but is C itself easy?
[22:17:09] <KatrinValerie> we attached a hall sensor to a digital in pin and simply count up 1 every time the magnet passes the sensor
[22:17:34] <KatrinValerie> so yeah there's also a small digital display attached to it
[22:17:35] <hans> no, C is not particularly easy.
[22:17:55] <hans> Urchin[emacs], nice
[22:18:16] <KatrinValerie> hans: once you understand the concept of pointers and memory allocation and learn a few convetions it is not that hard to produce useful C code
[22:18:27] <KatrinValerie> You just need to avoid unsafe legacy APIs
[22:18:40] <KatrinValerie> Especially the old string functions
[22:19:54] <hans> KatrinValerie, sure, but it's a pain in the ass. pretty much every time i tried doing stuff in C, it takes days before i wish i did it in C++ instead
[22:20:24] <hans> don't even have a string api, gotta manage those reallocs yourself~
[22:20:25] <Urchin[emacs]> hans: and I've been happy to have avoided C++ so far
[22:20:42] <Urchin[emacs]> hans: didn't like how the people programming in C++ responded to their own work
[22:20:49] <Berlin36> well
[22:20:55] <KatrinValerie> hans: well, I used to do driver development and reverse engineering so I got pretty deep into C and learned to appreciate it
[22:21:04] <KatrinValerie> got much more into C++ though
[22:21:10] <Berlin36> im learning go now, i feel like c++ is a language for big boiss
[22:21:13] <KatrinValerie> I am in love with that language
[22:21:15] <Urchin[emacs]> of cours, there's Go, which tries to be 21st century C
[22:21:24] <Berlin36> yeeeeee
[22:21:38] <KatrinValerie> And I will use C++ for the AI of my game if it turns out that I can't optimize it in python enough
[22:21:55] <hans> that explains why Go doesn't have exceptions (not ones you can catch anyway, it has PANICs which youre.. not supposed to catch? i think?)
[22:21:56] <Berlin36> KatrinValerie: for how long have you been coding?
[22:22:01] <KatrinValerie> OOP is making me over engineer my game

[22:23:02] <hans> Nanobot, which languages do you do? 
[22:23:09] <Urchin[emacs]> hans: error handling in Go has undergone some changes recently, AFAIK
[22:23:17] <Urchin[emacs]> hans: and I'm not up to date on it
[22:23:19] <KatrinValerie> Nanobot speaks in esoteric languages only
[22:23:44] <KatrinValerie> Rust has also been a contendor in that market share
[22:23:48] <Nanobot> hans: Mostly PHP and JavaScript. I've done some work in other languages, but not a lot.
[22:23:57] <isekaijin> KatrinValerie: What kind of game are you making?
[22:23:58] <KatrinValerie> It is trying to compete with C++ mostly if I am not mistaken
[22:24:13] <Poeticode> elixir is my waifu
[22:24:14] <KatrinValerie> isekaijin: platformer x rpg
[22:24:29] <isekaijin> Cool!
[22:24:42] <KatrinValerie> I am still very unsure about certain design aspects and for now I am just starting to get used to the graphics framework I am using
[22:24:54] <KatrinValerie> and starting to hack together code to handle controls maybe game config
[22:25:09] <KatrinValerie> start writing code for gamestate and introduce objects you can interact with etc
[22:25:20] <Poeticode> yeah game dev can be fuckin hard
[22:25:20] <Berlin36> whaaaaaaaaat KatrinValerie 
[22:25:24] <Berlin36> 20 years!
[22:25:32] <KatrinValerie> But I am dead set on using goal oriented programming for the AI
[22:25:45] <hans> Rust sure is an interesting language; it's even part of the Linux kernel now
[22:26:10] <KatrinValerie> Poeticode: still torn on writing the physics engine myself, I mean you do not need more than newtonian physics for this
[22:26:10] <Berlin36> many people want to rewrite the kernel from c to rust
[22:26:12] <Berlin36> why is that?
[22:26:23] <KatrinValerie> It is going to be sort of 2D
[22:26:29] <Berlin36> i mean they want the kernel to be rewritten in rust*
[22:26:39] <Poeticode> probably mainly memory-safety
[22:26:44] <KatrinValerie> Might try some funky pseudo 3D stuff for novelty as well
[22:26:55] <Urchin[emacs]> Elixir seems uninteresting, gets rid of the stuff that make Erlang interesting while it's main selling point is familiarity to programmers of a programming language I'm unfamiliar with
[22:26:56] <Poeticode> think rust's strictness prevents you from writing entire categories of bugs
[22:27:03] <Berlin36> oh
[22:27:25] <KatrinValerie> And yet is on the same ladder on the chomsky hirarchy as C
[22:28:17] <Duns_Scrotus> The syntax?  No
[22:28:19] <KatrinValerie> Berlin36: I am just a hobbiest programmer though, so I did not write much code in those 20years
[22:28:28] <Duns_Scrotus> C’s grammar is decidable
[22:28:33] <Poeticode> Urchin[emacs] what's the interesting part of erlang? also all erlang code is valid elixir code
[22:28:41] <Berlin36> well still 20 years is a lot :D
[22:28:51] <KatrinValerie> I invested massive amounts of time into reverse engineering world of warcraft back in the days

[22:38:46] <KatrinValerie> Berlin36: mostly to mess around a little bit and have fun, see what the server would allow and when you would get disconnected
[22:39:11] <Berlin36> oh lol
[22:39:14] <KatrinValerie> Infinite gold was not something you could achieve client side
[22:39:21] <Berlin36> yeah i know
[22:39:23] <Berlin36> tried it
[22:39:29] <Berlin36> didn't work :(
[22:39:35] <KatrinValerie> But you could glitch through walls, jump infinitely high, negate fall damage
[22:39:42] <Berlin36> oh wow
[22:40:26] <KatrinValerie> Well also I was involved in botting, I was a teen and justified it by saying that if I invest the time to develop a bot, I earned the right to use it ingame xD
