[02:23:06] <jan6> do you mean indian indian, or american "indian", and if former, then do you mean modern or traditional, and rich or poor people's? ;P
[02:23:07] <jan6> JimBuntu just made a tongue-in-cheek joke, as per wikipedia, "Adopted in the Western world, pajamas are soft, warm, and traditionally loose garments derived from the Indian and Persian bottom-wear, the pyjamas."
[02:24:11] *** Quits: _inky (~inky_@46.36.119.105) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[02:24:51] <jan6> "The original pyjāmā are loose, lightweight trousers fitted with drawstring waistbands and worn by many Indian Sikhs, as well as Muslims and Hindus,[4][5] and later adopted by Europeans during British East India Company rule in India"
[02:27:46] <jan6> Joanna: ^
[02:27:55] <Joanna> I thought he meant American Indian
[02:28:30] <jan6> he specifically said "it's Indian clothing, pajamas :)", lol
[02:29:57] <jan6> the smiley suggests that it is normal pajamas, and not some american indian thing of the same name (not that their stuff even has that sort of sound to it, anyway)
[02:31:10] <jan6> also to avoid confusion, it's generally good practice to call them "native americans" not "american indians", since they have nothing to do with india, other thn some  stupid ass dude thinking they were
[02:35:57] <Joanna> He also has Native American ancestry so it’s possible he likes those sort of clothes
[02:36:44] <jan6> ancestry has no relation to liking clothes
[02:37:35] <jan6> potentially familiarity with them, and being aware of them, but not even that, necessarily
[02:38:55] *** Joins: _inky (inky_@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/inky)
[02:40:08] <Joanna> Of course not hence the unfortunate situation of most people giving up their native clothing or lack there of
[02:42:58] <jan6> why would you care about "native clothing", you wear what you like, not something that has an arbitrary label of "you should wear it" (well, at least for not-very-public settings)
[02:46:04] <jan6> you can make it a tradition to wear patchwork clothing every thursday if you want, it's all arbitrary labels
[02:46:27] <Joanna> Oh sure they get people to “like” things that’s called brainwashing. Anyone who likes wearing uncomfortable clothes is most definitely brainwashed in some way
[02:46:44] <jan6> not really
[02:47:02] <jessicara> pressured by standards more than brainwashed maybe
[02:47:24] <jan6> ^pressured, quit possibly, brainwashed, nah
[02:48:24] <Joanna> Peer pressure
[02:48:33] <jan6> some people want to be seen a certain way (e.g. "beautiful", "classy", "well-off") and will sacrifice comfort for the sake of fitting that image (as far as they know)
[02:49:09] <Joanna> What gives people the idea of what is good looking?
[02:49:16] <Joanna> Propaganda
[02:49:22] <jan6> uh, no
[02:49:34] <jan6> other people around them
[02:50:17] <Joanna> And the other people around them get their ideas from where? Mass media?
[02:50:49] *** Quits: plankster (~plankster@user/plankers) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[02:51:16] <jan6> also nearly nothing you view as propaganda, fits the actual definition of propaganda, anyway
[02:51:46] <jan6> you wanting people to wear "native clothes" is just as much propaganda than them wanting not to
[02:51:53] <Joanna> What an odd coincidence that everyone on earth decided to suddenly dump their native clothing that they liked for thousands of years and go with british style clothes made in sweatshops
[02:52:18] <jan6> uh, where do you take the "liked" part?
[02:52:30] <jan6> people wear the clothes everyone else wears
[02:52:58] <Joanna> If that’s the case nothing would have changed
[02:53:38] *** Joins: portalrat (~portalrat@user/portalrat)
[02:53:40] <jan6> your huge wigs and 17 layers of fancy dresses might be really annoying, but that's just what rich people like you are SUPPOSED to wear, well, the "normal" ones at least, right?
[02:53:50] <jan6> nothing DID change
[02:54:20] <jan6> only fashion did
[02:54:54] *** Joins: plankster (~plankster@user/plankers)
[02:55:23] <jan6> and focus moved away from doing almost everything yourself, to specialized jobs
[02:55:42] <Joanna> Fashion changed because people were conquered by british and Americans
[02:56:03] <jan6> back in the day there were very few specialized jobs, almost everything was done by you/your family, for yourself
[02:56:15] <jan6> but then came industrial revolution
[02:56:43] <jan6> and now instead of everyone having 3 shirts, they could afford 13
[02:57:27] <jan6> which meant instead, they could allocate something else to the time previously spend preparing material, and making the shirts
[02:58:12] <jan6> and why would you spend more money and time on doing something you don't even enjoy, for no real gain? so they didn't
[02:59:08] <jan6> and neither did theyr children... or their children... and over time there was also less need to preserve and fix things, because "just buy another one", mass market was created
[03:00:12] <jan6> if you can get a new shirt for 1-3$€, why would you make your own for 20-30, which is gonna also be a lot less comfortable the first 5 or 10 times you attempt to make one?
[03:00:34] <Joanna> So now everything is disposable including people
[03:00:55] <jan6> well, not really, but sorta, sure
[03:01:46] <jan6> where there's enough supply, you can just discard and pick a new one... but that assumes you have more or equal supply than demand
[03:01:47] <Joanna> We are very disposable from the viewpoint of billionaires
[03:02:06] <jan6> not at all
[03:02:33] <jan6> because billionaires don't think in terms of people, they do in terms of thousands of people
[03:03:20] <jan6> and more thn that, just mone and products, e.g. "I want a spaceship" not "I want John, Cassidy and Ahmad to build me a spaceship"
[03:04:21] <Joanna> About making your own clothes it’s not that it’s not fun and satisfying it’s that it’s been discouraged along with every other self reliant activity. And no I’m not happy buying a cheap ugly , shoddy thing in a store rather than making something good for myself
[03:04:39] <jan6> it's not DIScouraged
[03:04:46] <jan6> it's just not ENcouraged
[03:05:03] <jan6> there's just no benefit, as far as most people see
[03:05:33] <jan6> especially whe they're ALREADY unhappy, and want to drown their sorrows in mindless entertainment
[03:06:36] <jan6> and if they give it a go, it's just gonna come out ugly, skewed, and they'll just not try the next 5 times till they get skilled enough to make it well
[03:07:05] <Joanna> If anything it’s an indication of how dumbed down people are. Before I started knitting I thought that looks so hard to do. But I was compelled to learn knitting and crochet because what I wanted to wear was not available in stores at all. I wanted cotton lace shirts for hot weather
[03:07:50] <Joanna> It was hard getting over the intimidation of making a shirt
[03:07:53] <jan6> these last 2 or 3 generations have been based on "you're doing great, honey", and instant gratification, if they don't do well at something, they're not even gonna attempt doing it till they are great
[03:08:05] <Hydragyrum> ^
[03:08:09] <Joanna> I think this learned helplessness is there on purpose.
[03:08:35] <jan6> it's not on purpose, it's just a byproduct of full generations of bad parenting
[03:08:45] <Joanna> Heck they have even convinced people that it’s hard to cook soup and need to buy it in a can.
[03:08:51] <Hydragyrum> that'd be pretty dang tough to do on purpose -- it's a generational thing
[03:09:48] <Joanna> It’s an advertising industry thing.
[03:09:54] <jan6> one generation grows up lacking resources, and overflows their kids with all the fancy things they can, preventing any challenges from ever appearing, so the kids never learn to deal with stuff they're not instantly good at
[03:10:24] <Joanna> It’s not that good things can’t be made in factories it’s that they aren’t.
[03:10:32] <jan6> they are
[03:10:38] <jan6> you just gotta look for them
[03:11:08] <Joanna> I’ve looked everywhere. Store after store of shoddy junk
[03:11:10] <jan6> making good things is more expensive than making junk, and if people buy the junk anyway, why waste the profits
[03:11:24] <jan6> obviously the stores stock the stuff people will buy
[03:11:39] <jan6> that's why you can't rely on traditional stores to sell NON-junk stuff
[03:12:08] <Joanna> Sweaters with I reinforced part on neck. Are they being made by idiots?
[03:12:31] <jan6> if buying junk is "good enough" for most people, who want to change out their entire wardrobe every year ANYWAY, so they don't care if it breaks, then why would they stock more expensive stuff that's better?
[03:13:01] <Hydragyrum> they're being made by people willing to work for cheap -- so usually not the brightest bulbs...
[03:13:09] <jan6> also that
[03:13:22] <jan6> but also, the DESIGNERS are NOT the cheap people
[03:13:23] <Joanna> There should be an underwriters lab for clothing and simulate at least 5 years of being worn everyday and washed
[03:13:32] <jan6> so that's not actually an excuse, Hydragyrum 
[03:14:03] <Hydragyrum> true, but good design doesn't really make up for shoddy work
[03:14:21] <Joanna> Hydragyrum: I don’t blame the poor sweat shop workers I blame the designers an outsourcing
[03:14:26] <jan6> most of the shoddy stuff can be reduced by designing with that in mind, too
[03:15:17] <jan6> but also by having the things made in non-slave factories, of course
[03:16:22] <jan6> also Joanna, the designers don't really control anything, so you can't really blame them
[03:16:28] <Joanna> I have a cheap leather change purse that they used cheap thread on which is now breaking. I would have gladly paid extra for better thread. Now I have to waste my time trying to repair it which is not going to be easy.
[03:16:41] <jan6> they might suggest a sane solution, but the higher ups are just gonna reject it
[03:16:58] *** Joins: XV8 (~XV8@2601:5cb:c001:50:289b:8a8a:656f:919)
[03:17:11] <jan6> none of my stuff are breaking ;P
[03:17:24] <jan6> and I've not seeked out super duper stuff, either
[03:18:03] <Joanna> I remember awhile back there was a car maker that decided to save money by using a cheap part and killed quite a few people.
[03:19:25] <Joanna> Most stuff is assembled ok but not designed well. There are a few cases where things aren’t assembled properly.
[03:20:42] <jan6> I kinda wonder how hard it would be to make an "Open Car" project, which is open source, and safety tested, and also designed so that it's possible to mill and manifacture all the parts with reasonably common equipment (maybe not necessarily at home, but close enough)... I suppose the biggest obstacle is as always, to get any money out of it
[03:22:01] <Joanna> Recently I discovered that a pair of leather hiking boots I’ve had for awhile that looked like they were in good condition probably have to be thrown away because they used shoddy synthetic polymers for the bottoms that literally disintegrated into dust.
[03:22:54] <jan6> you could seek out a good boot-worker and have new soles attached? but of course, that's probably about same cost as just getting new onws
[03:23:11] <jan6> depending if it's nearby, that is
[03:23:30] <Joanna> They like to sneak garbage into things made with good materials to make them break
[03:23:35] <jan6> if you had to drive or ship it halfway around world, THEN it'd be about same price
[03:23:48] <jan6> not really
[03:23:54] <jan6> the world is NOT a conspiracy
[03:24:09] <jan6> there's many reasons for doing anything any given way
[03:24:45] <jan6> for example, they might use that material for better shock absorbion
[03:24:54] <Joanna> The vibram sole itself is still good and the leather part is good but everything in between is destroyed
[03:26:17] <jan6> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtxUDeJvyk (kinda jokey guy, but good video)
[03:26:58] <Joanna> Some of the parts that cracked were not related to shock absorption. They were too cheap to use real rubber
[03:28:00] <jan6> gonna watch now, prolly also good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IMDJg1nOD8
[03:28:45] <jan6> both are showing US-based custom book makers, and the first one even has them mention that they also repair non-custom boots also
[03:30:18] <jan6> apparently the second one is entirely uncut, and as such, multi-part series, this link is purely 45 min or so of taking measurements, lol
[03:32:15] <jan6> even when a craft is dying out, or has died out, there's always gonna be SOME people doing, or attempting to do it
[03:59:33] <Joanna> That’s interesting how boots are made properly

[04:09:18] *** Quits: genera (~Genera@user/genera) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[04:11:38] <jan6> the second one is super long and chatty, going quite detailed with all the explanations of everything, to the point that I bet that just that single video would give you a huge jump start, if you were to get involved with bootmaking 'n stuff
[04:13:02] <Joanna> Those kinds of boots could be made on assembly line

[04:15:15] <Joanna> Of course they could they would just need more people
[04:15:25] <jan6> that's the entirety of the point of custom boot makers, that they can take personalized fits and styles, per person
[04:15:40] <jan6> you can't generalize into "boot sizes" and fit everyone
[04:16:18] <jan6> plus if you wanted to make a factory line of those super-quality boots, then that'd be prohibitatively expensive
[04:16:25] <Joanna> If you have a batch process
[04:17:25] <Joanna> I guess you could make the most common sizes. I liked the high quality materials
[04:17:51] <jan6> that's the problem, that if your foot is not one of the "standard sizes", you're not gonna have ANY boots
[04:17:59] <Joanna> My point is most shoes don’t even have high quality materials
[04:18:08] <jan6> neither do most food items
[04:18:14] <jan6> so what?
[04:18:21] <jan6> you just choose to not buy 'em
[04:18:35] <Joanna> I would be barefoot!
[04:18:54] <Joanna> It’s no longer a choice.
[04:18:54] <jan6> not if you buy good enough footwear, instead
[04:18:59] <jan6> lol
[04:19:19] <Joanna> It’s like trying to buy unpasteurized milk
[04:19:27] <jan6> the main problem with today's world is, kinda paradoxically, finding stuff, despite having search engines
[04:19:41] <jan6> that's quite easy over here ;P
[04:19:55] <Joanna> Everything is outsourced far away
[04:20:07] <jan6> not if you ARE at that "far away" ;P
[04:20:10] <jan6> not everything is
[04:20:23] <jan6> every country has some stuff produced internally, too
[04:20:35] <Joanna> Consider yourself lucky I can’t get uncooked milk easily
[04:20:37] <jan6> it's just a question of what, and where
[04:23:20] <jan6> I can buy unpasteurized mil for like 1.25€/l straight from store ;P
[04:25:33] <jan6> but it's all up to your local people organizing their stuff, e.g. local raw milk makers making an organization, and convincing stores to sell their stuff
[04:26:04] <jan6> and there's always non-store ways to buy stuff, e.g. facebook groups, or whatnot your local variant is (some places have active whatsapp, some telegram, etc)
[04:27:19] <jan6> if you find your local community of like-minded people (or found one, and keep content in it, so people have a point to join), it'll be WAY easier to find good stuff
[04:28:11] <jan6> including trading your own stuff, e.g. selling some self-made bread to you in exchange for you repairing their clothes, or making a scarf for them, or whatnot
[04:29:32] <jan6> if you get involved with people directly, instead of stores, there's often either interesting things to learn, and/or options to negotiate stuff
[04:31:25] <jan6> e.g. how do they even get the materials that you don't see in stores, or would they be willing to give a discount if you bring them some a bit of homemade snacks or whatever (just the first examples I thought of)
[04:32:27] <jan6> you might find out that there's an entire underground network of people interested in stuff you never thought that anyone cared about, or cared ENOUGH about
[04:34:35] <jan6> e.g. if there's a considerable enough amount of immigrants of X shared country/culture, they might well have some of their guys directly transport much fresher food to their own store, as compared to normal stores, in addition to having spices and stuff that simply don't exist in your culture, and nobody knows or uses about outside their home country
[04:37:33] <jan6> much fresher, partially because normal stores get huge batches at a time, and ship cost effectively, while those guys might drive them with a dingy little van, often over speed limit, and as such, prioritizing speed, able to choose perfectly ripe fruit, instead of half-unripe
[04:39:14] <jan6> also there's plenty of reasons why things are done the way they are
[04:39:33] <Joanna> To get uncooked milk I would have to find the far away farm and go there and try to buy milk it would be impractical and possibly futile
[04:39:51] <jan6> well, where are you abouts?
[04:40:09] <jan6> I could try to do a quick look for stuff around you, since you're unable to ;P
[04:40:10] <Joanna> People are separated from their food

[04:42:24] <jan6> impossible to know
[04:42:55] <jan6> there isn't any "cow radar" after all
[04:43:16] <Joanna> Use google maps and measure distance to nearest dairy farm

[04:51:17] *** Joins: HaMsTeRs (~Thunderbi@210.3.213.4)
[04:51:29] <jan6> seems quite reasonable
[04:51:58] <Joanna> Not really
[04:52:32] <Joanna> Hi HaMsTeRs welcome back
[04:52:34] <jan6> not if you compare to the much more efficient other milk, sure
[04:53:29] <jan6> but that's like "$10 for a bag of chips that was made by hand, which has to also include costs for manual labor and equipment maintenance? that's outrageous!"
[04:53:35] <Joanna> In the us a gallon of uncooked milk was about $18 a few years ago
[04:53:54] <jan6> a gallon is MASSIVE tho
[04:55:17] <jan6> but there's plenty of things that contribute to costs, too
[04:55:18] <Joanna> Not for a group it isn’t
[04:56:21] <jan6> e.g. cost of cow feed, cost of electricity, cost of transport, cost of shelf life (the faster it spoils, the more expensive it is to deal with), etc etc
[04:56:46] <Joanna> PROFIT!
[04:57:01] <jan6> that's on top of all that other stuff
[04:57:17] <jan6> for food, the profit margins aren't really that big
[04:58:01] <jan6> well, for "basic food", at least (like bread, meat, milk, fish, etc, not the chemical stuff, or proccessed stuff, or cooked stuff, or whatnot)
[04:58:45] <Joanna> The made good milk expensive by harassing the farmers who produce it.
[04:59:00] <jan6> as if that helped them
[04:59:11] * jan6 slep tho
[04:59:45] <jan6> just set up a personal arrangement with some farmers and organize yourself to resell locally, PROFIT ;P
[05:01:47] <jan6> (as in, people tell you they want X amount, prepay, you do trips, say, every 3 days, and calculate your valuable time and gas price into the price, but don't need any profit margins)
[05:02:48] <Joanna> I don’t own a car so isn’t happening
[05:03:18] <jan6> all you need is a circle of interested parties
[05:03:42] <Joanna> And I doubt that there is dairy farm by train station
[05:04:43] <jan6> you could pay someone else to drive, or someone else could do it instead of you, depends how nice and/or desperate the farmers are, they might even meet up part of the way there, e.g. come near a bus or train stop
[05:05:44] <jan6> etc etc
[05:05:56] <jan6> solutions are endless, if you just think a bit
[05:06:22] <Joanna> The solution is probably living in the country
[05:06:29] <jan6> and having your own cows
[05:06:39] <Joanna> Yea
[05:07:04] <Joanna> That’s a lot of responsibility. Have to be there all the time
[05:07:11] <Joanna> I’d rather share cows
