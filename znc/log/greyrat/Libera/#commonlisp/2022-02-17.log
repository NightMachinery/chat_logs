[10:56:44] <mfiano> I read Keene this week with not expecting much. But, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Her writing style sat very well with me, I actually unexpectedly learned a thing or two, and solidified my reasoning why I choose to do things a certain way without ever giving much thought to it.
[10:57:57] <mfiano> The example program ideas were somewhat poorly chosen, but it is a dated book. They did serve to illustrate the point though.
[10:59:58] <mfiano> I rate it quite high and would recommend it as a CLOS refresher, or introductory reference.
[11:00:06] <edgar-rft> CLOS was very young at that time, but it's a great book. I'm still using it to look-up details of basic things I have forgotten :-)
[11:00:10] <mfiano> My two cents, take it or leave it :)
[11:00:55] <mfiano> edgar-rft: Great, yeah I agree it is a good reference for that.
[11:03:37] <beach> I like her writing, but I was extremely put off by the example at the time I read it the first time.
[11:05:30] <beach> One example relies on processes (threads) which were not common at the time, and which are not part of the standard, so the example could not be tested on a standard implementation.  Another example was about distributing software for different platforms, which was not my main preoccupation at the time.
[11:06:43] <mfiano> I wasn't that put off by them, as they were not full programs and not meant to be implemented. Infact, that particular example called out to a unspecified implementation/OS dependent function for its dirty work.
[11:07:24] <mfiano> They were simple examples to convey the topic at hand, not anything worth reproducing even if they could be.

[11:12:56] <mfiano> I think the examples, while dated and not relevant today after standardization, go very well with her writing; explaining every detail, and often repeating important details multiple times. You are left with a clear picture of how the internal mechanisms of CLOS work, without needing to try anything for yourself.
[11:14:10] <Guest74> it's been a while, but I recall it seemed to be lacking in method combinations.
[11:14:37] <mfiano> It did not cover the long form.
[11:14:44] <Guest74> overall it was a good read.

[13:50:48] <SR-71> Did someone ever deploy hunchentoot in a live environment?
[13:51:52] <flip214> SR-71: not directly on the internet, only behind some proxies
[13:52:29] <SR-71> How was your experience?
[13:55:53] <flip214> 200-300µsec per request per CPU, so more than fast enough for any real-world use, mostly stable after some configuration of quux-hunchentoot
[13:56:08] <flip214> "mostly" before config, afterwards all-okay
[13:59:19] <beach> I know very little about web stuff, but an image-based solution like Hunchentoot has got to be faster than what I understand some Unix-based solutions do, i.e. fork a process for each request.  No?
[13:59:51] <moon-child> I don't think any modern unix-based implementation does that
[14:00:05] <beach> That's good I guess.
[14:00:13] <flip214> well, yeah, the old CGI fork-for-each-request stuff was much slower. then came FCGI which used a socket for communication to existing processes...
[14:00:17] <moon-child> and fastcgi is already more than 20 years old, I think

[18:49:49] <jdz> My position on this is that having such a limit is a feature, but instead of it being a hard limit it could be a soft limit (at least in case of SBCL).
[18:52:06] <mfiano> I see no reason for not specifying an incredibly large heap; one that would leave your system's other processes usable if it were to fill up. On my 128G machine, I specify 120. It's not like SBCL will make this all resident.

[20:48:37] <Guest74> when using intern in a macro, is sane package where the macro is defined or where it is used?
[20:49:11] <Guest74> i guess that's a n sbcl thing, default package I mean.

[20:54:55] <White_Flame> intern is executed when the macro is invoked, which is compile-time of the usage location
[20:55:54] <White_Flame> (assuming normal usage of intern executed in the defmacro body, not deferred in the returned list)

[21:03:21] <random-nick> technically, it's during macro-expansion time
[21:03:57] <White_Flame> yep
[21:04:11] <Guest74> welp, there's the question in my question.
[21:04:14] <random-nick> which isn't necessarily during compilation time if the implementation has an interpeter
[21:04:24] <White_Flame> but I thought that was a little tautological given the question :)
