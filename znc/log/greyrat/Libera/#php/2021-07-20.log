[00:01:02] <__adrian> i'm not sure what your question is, there
[00:01:10] <__adrian> have you tried that?
[00:01:29] <W8TVI> No, I haven't.
[00:01:44] <__adrian> http://3v4l.org   :)
[00:02:09] <__adrian> btw  filter_var() is usually more useful than  filter_input()
[00:02:51] <W8TVI> Thanks for that link, bookmarking it!
[00:04:39] <W8TVI> I guess the question is, is it "safe" to do $rating = $_GET['rating'];  if I've already validated it earlier to be a number between 1 and 5, or would there be a more correct way of setting the variable?
[00:06:13] <stenno> intval ?
[00:06:15] <stenno> hm
[00:06:24] <stenno> i guess if its safely validated
[00:06:28] <__adrian> $int = filter_var( . . . );  if ($int === false) { throw new Exception("Value must be an integer between 1 and 5"); }
[00:06:35] <__adrian> no, no intval
[00:06:40] <__adrian> filter_var
[00:06:58] <stenno> i thought the vilter_var was the assertion

[00:07:11] <__adrian> it's a check

[00:14:44] <W8TVI> What I think I understand, is that I don't want to use $_GET['rating'] to set my variable directly, but I want to validate it.   So after I have validated that it is what I expect it to be (a number between 1 and 5, including the numbers 1 and 5), I want to set the variable so I can can use it later in the script. What is the proper way of getting that number from $_GET to the variable?
[00:15:07] <__adrian> see above
[00:15:18] <__adrian> assign the return value of filter_var to a variable
[00:18:51] <W8TVI> Instead of echo("Variable value is within the legal range");'
[00:19:17] <W8TVI> I'd use 'return $rating'
[00:19:30] <__adrian> echo is for output. it's not something you'd generally want to do in the middle of input validation.
[00:19:34] <__adrian> ...no
[00:19:40] <__adrian> do you know what a return value is?
[00:19:51] <__adrian> i.e., from a function?

[18:44:10] <php-bot> anything useful that you can do with a static class, you can also do with a non-static class that you make only one instance of. AND you get to stop worrying about side-effects.

[20:39:56] <locsmif> Hi all. What is the status of the mysqlnd_ms load balancing plugin for mysqlnd? Is it recommended to use this?
[20:41:13] <locsmif> At the bottom here, I see an idea about session consistency: "session consistency guarantees that a user will only be redirected to nodes that have already replicated his changes" ... was this ever implemented since this was last modified? (2017)
[20:41:24] <locsmif> https://wiki.php.net/pecl/mysqlnd_ms
[20:42:23] <locsmif> Right now we use mysql-router, but read/write splitting requires modifying the application to direct queries to different ports in the database backend manually
[20:42:48] <locsmif> Supposedly mysqlnd_ms supports automatic read/write splitting, so that would be awesome
[20:46:42] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[20:46:43] <__adrian> no idea. i'd never even heard of it before. note the package is unmaintained.
[20:47:00] <locsmif> Yeah I was a bit afraid that would be the answer ;-)
[20:47:09] <__adrian> also note latest version seems to be 1.6, which is 2013, not 2017
[20:47:14] <locsmif> So people use haproxy setups then or?
[20:47:48] <__adrian> in most cases (with mysql anyway) i've seen it managed in the application
[20:48:18] <locsmif> Then we might as well stick with mysql-router and direct the right query to the right port manually
[20:48:43] <locsmif> Not a problem, as long as we get that load balancing goodness, which is what we're aiming for
[20:50:55] *** Parts: akk (~akk@75.161.155.222) (+++)
[20:54:36] <Sammitch> locsmif: you might want something like galera or maxscale
[20:54:49] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi how are you sir?
[20:55:11] <locsmif> Sammitch: we used to have Galera or something similar, but in our new setup, we decided to dramatic simplify things
[20:55:19] <locsmif> dramatically*
[20:55:58] <locsmif> There we haproxy's/keepalived's etc. all over the place on multiple VMs. Now, HAProxy just manages the SSL/TSL connections on the load balancers
[20:56:27] <locsmif> And we use MySQL 8.x's InnoDB cluster
[20:57:25] <locsmif> mysqlrouter is a bit newish, but at least it supports connecting to two different  (four actually, if you include the new mysqlx protocol) ports, one R/W, one R/O
[20:57:39] *** Joins: ge (~g@37.214.79.50)

[20:58:16] <locsmif> (Well, depending on how it's configured, but that is the default)
[20:59:10] <locsmif> Thing is, obviously we have to revisit all the repositories and re-orient our PHP application to support that
[20:59:47] <locsmif> It's organised enough that it would work, the only worry is some leftover legacy stuff, which might as well connect to the R/W port only if need be
[20:59:51] <Rockwood> NoiseEee, hi
[21:00:16] <locsmif> But then I saw mysqlnd_ms and (briefly ;-) got a bit enthusiastic, heh

[21:02:19] <Rockwood> i am fine
[21:02:28] <__adrian> hi
