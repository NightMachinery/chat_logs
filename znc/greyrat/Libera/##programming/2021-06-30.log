[00:12:30] <blackop> i am asking why it is that popular?
[00:13:07] <piou> Huge legacy codebase, accessible to non-professionals so there are tons of little scripts in many companies
[00:13:40] <blackop> yea
[00:14:20] <piou> It's like a cockroach, it's not so much that it's popular, rather nobody knows how to get rid of it everywhere (I'm a bit harsh, some people like visual basic and for GUIs it's not bad, but <>)

[00:22:18] <deniska> may also be python, but not cool machine learning variety, but boring scrape data from pdf and put in oracle db kind of python
[00:22:38] <Izem> I do admit to seeing a lot of node in job apps though

[00:23:50] <pyzozord> I think tech choice is not just the fad itself, it's also seecondary effects of fads. More people are into it == bigger talent pool, richer community, more free code, bigger chance for longer livelyhood
[00:24:28] <piou> And there are lots of "boring" companies such as banks, logistics, etc that develop pretty much everything in house. They're sitting on a codebase that is 10+ yo and will never see the light of internet. These are not the ones taking up node or rust.
[00:24:28] <deniska> pyzozord: if you want higher quality talent pool, you should pick an obscure tech
[00:24:29] <pyzozord> so I think how many people like the tech economically trumps how good the tech
[00:24:44] <deniska> nobody learns haskell with a sole purpose of getting a haskell job :D
[00:24:52] <davros> rust is not a fad
[00:25:11] <neshpion> computers are a fad
[00:25:13] <davros> show me another language that is secture and as fast as c++ and as easy to scale
[00:25:14] <Izem> no one said that?
[00:25:21] <deniska> davros: C++
[00:25:33] <deniska> well, probably no as secure, but close :)
[00:25:39] <pyzozord> deniska: yeah I think I agree, but I think most businesses don't care for higher quality talent, they are looking for some compromise between talent quality, tech longevity, open source support etc
[00:25:39] <Izem> java :P
[00:25:44] <deniska> if you never touch 90% of the language :D
[00:25:51] <davros> i said "is secture and as easy to scale", c++ fails that :)  but as fast, sure !
[00:25:57] <piou> davros: being a great language has nothing to do with that
[00:26:07] <deniska> pyzozord: so, java, C#, python, "modern php"
[00:26:36] <davros> i've dabbled with alot of languages - rust is the only one that to me looks like a viable step beyond c++
[00:26:46] <pyzozord> deniska: yeah I guess so. Btw interesting "modern php". My php story stopped around 5.3 and 6, is "modern" php much different?
[00:27:01] <davros> d never grabbed me.. other things as ok as utility languages but until rust.. c++ was untouchable
[00:27:17] <deniska> I personally don't enjoy rust aesthetically, but it's not like I ever cared about problems rust would be good at
[00:27:17] <Izem> the real answer seems to be using a gc tbh
[00:27:35] <Izem> isn't it that the rust libraries pull in a lot of c and c++
[00:27:49] <Izem> is the standard library even safe?
[00:27:50] <deniska> pyzozord: modern PHP is pretty much like writing java, but putting $ in front of variable names
[00:27:55] <pyzozord> I don't like language which have a lot of features, I like languages that have few features that are highly composible for synergistic effects
[00:28:02] <davros> they do but in time you can rewrite those, and you can write anything new in rust
[00:28:04] <deniska> pyzozord: using namespaces, classes and all that jazz
[00:28:19] <Izem> pyzozord yeah that is the key
[00:28:25] <Izem> but doing that is pretty hard
[00:28:25] <pyzozord> deniska: ah yeah I smelt that trend back then - that's why I jumped ship to js, I wasn't big on all the abstract factories
[00:28:40] <Izem> and the ones that did, are not popular :P
[00:28:47] <davros> rust has a high barrier to entry but once a program crosses a certain size it starts to shine
[00:29:02] <deniska> it's funny how while PHP tried to distance away from file based routing, modern JS frameworks like next embrace it :D
[00:29:13] <pyzozord> Izem: can you give some examples? :)
[00:29:16] <Izem> I do like rust though
[00:29:17] <luiserebii> around how long should you wait to hear back from a technical interview?
[00:29:26] <neshpion> i kind of like rust but there are some snags that i dislike about it, like the fact that `anyhow` has to exist, and the fact that there's no keyword-args or even default arg values!!! i had to define a macro to simulate default args
[00:29:41] <davros> i think it'll be vastly superior in a team environment, but working solo i can now see it'll help me avoid bitrot.. its much easier to refactor and keep things clean

[00:30:41] <pyzozord> Izem: ah good, apl is on my radar. Not sure what scheme is though. Isn't that related to lisp?
[00:30:57] <piou> That's a lisp dialect
[00:30:58] <Izem> yeah, it's just a refined version
[00:30:59] <luiserebii> Yes, Scheme is a Lisp dialect
[00:31:05] <Izem> or dialect yeah
[00:31:11] <piou> But lisp dialects can be *very* different from one another
[00:31:22] <GeDaMo> Logo is a Lisp dialect
[00:31:25] <deniska> I think we'll eventually see a language which would take in good parts of rust, but fix its annoyances
[00:31:39] <Izem> davros I've been wondering if you can't do it at a binary level
[00:31:40] <luiserebii> [o: if they don't reply by then... should i just assume they rejected and move on?

[00:33:00] <Izem> davros well as long as you can consume/use c++ object code
[00:33:04] <pyzozord> but I had a localized version, with commands and keywords in my native language

[00:33:21] <GeDaMo> A lot of Logos were cut down to just turtle graphics but a Full Logo has most of the best bits of Lisp

[00:34:28] <davros> ah yeah well rust binds to anything that provides C ABI callable functions - so yes - you can just link c/c++ object files into a rust project and call any C interfaces (not c++, thats trickier)

[02:00:26] <[o> what's a delphi like language?
[02:00:41] <[o> Delphi is from borland.
[02:00:47] <[o> does it have a name?
[02:00:53] <Joanna> I mean the properties that have getter and setter

[02:02:12] <Joanna> Is it possible to do in delphi?
[02:02:13] <[o> now I wonder what triggered your question
[02:02:21] <[o> because it doesn't make much sense

[02:07:27] <mrig> Joanna: do you have referenced in Lazarus?
[02:07:35] <mrig> sorry references.

[02:07:47] <[o> pointers
[02:07:53] <[o> and procedures / function types too
[02:08:20] <[o> that "self referential" term is something not clear
[02:08:36] <[o> use language standardized terms when possible, please
[02:08:49] <mrig> each function takes the object reference or pointer as a parameter, so is modified, and you iterate through all the functions passing in the same object.

[02:12:53] <ollierees> Whenever I program in that reddit language, I always have to deal with lifetimes. Granted, I'm programming data structures like linked lists and graphs, but I always get an error telling me to tack a lifetime into the structure. At this point I may as well tack lifetimes onto C structures with constructers and destructors, which I normally do. Pissing in my ear and saying it's raining.

[02:19:31] <jeaye> I find the best way to learn a lang's idioms is through immersion.

[09:47:54] <Burkuf> bladdezz: What makes testing and test driven development useful skills to have?
[09:49:25] <blahboybaz> Well you want to know that software is robust and functions properly and that it doesn't have any glaring security issues. And test driven dev is kind of a way to 'define' the code before you write it.
[09:49:29] <blahboybaz> I guess
[09:49:54] <Burkuf> what do you mean by "define" the code before you write it?
[09:50:13] <Valware> I guess understand your structure before you build it

[09:50:36] <Valware> at least that's how I interpret :)
[09:50:37] <blahboybaz> If the code has to fit the test then the test is kind of a "mold" for the code you write

[11:34:22] <xeno> mrig: my university' CS department branched out from the physics department, and one of the most famous professors there (Ole Johan Dahl, one of the two inventors of Simula) once stated "If you wanna do AI, just head over to linguistics or social studies. Here, we're doing science!"

[11:35:07] <rindolf> xeno: heh
[11:37:33] <xeno> you can prove that some of the involved algorithms are correct, but for the whole thing, all you have is statisticsa

[11:39:07] <c705> if ai is able to truely emulate humans, then we are almost surely one and the same

[11:40:53] <mrig> so the area that is under investigation shifts somewhat, and it really is computer science.

That way, any conditions you want to impose later (besides undoing what's already downloaded for personal use) will be fine, all rights are by default reserved and courts are very strongly on the side of rightsholders.

Let's say today your app relies on username and password for authentication or Oauth, but tomorrow you want to switch to 2 FA, how are you going to handle those users that chose Oauth. Of course you can do it but not easily.
[17:27:38] <W> anyway, to come back to what I was saying about that being two different points; yes, you need a security expert involved when dealing with securing people's data and restricting access, but also, that was the hope of the spec, that *the experts on the standards committee* could be the ones making the security choices, where even inexperienced programmers could follow the standard point by point and make a secure implementation
[17:28:14] <mrig> ah cool, that works :)

[17:29:17] <W> mrig, to some degree, depending on standard
[17:30:20] <W> mostly what happens is that a standard at least lets a few open source developers make reusable and interoperable components that more inexperienced programmers can just use with minimal coding of anything security at all
[17:30:31] <mrig> fewer programmers perhaps, and those that do program being better able to implement a standard.

[18:14:24] <pulse> hmm maybe i can do //TOREMOVE
[18:15:15] <sjmulder> pulse, I'd avoid such situations, manual things to do before release is a red flag

[21:21:40] <Izem> does meta programming mean you get access to the structure of the programming language?
[21:23:06] <GeDaMo> That might be one aspect of it
[21:24:36] <Izem> interesting, the languages that seem to do that really well are in some prefix or postfix form
[21:25:57] <InPhase> Izem: Fundamentally, metaprogramming is code that creates code.
[21:27:10] <InPhase> Izem: This can be as basic as a program that spits out source code to later compile, or it can be dynamic with reflection, or a compile-time feature like macros or C++ templates.

[23:33:10] <deniska> I can even look up answers on SO for that platform :D
[23:34:15] <deniska> imagine programming without SO
[23:35:01] <Izem> SO always great for those obscure questions
[23:35:01] <deniska> you have books, a bootleg MSDN CD, and maybe a forum you spend an hour or two a day on a dialup connection :D

[23:42:09] <alycidyne> Hello, a directed tree can be expressed in a table by having each row store the key to its 'parent', but doesn't this make tree walks and searches slow because the parent must be located in the whole table?

[23:43:05] <GeDaMo> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)
[23:43:18] <d3x0r> not really.... the parent id is indexed... so from any row it knows pretty much immdiately what the related parent is
[23:43:48] <alycidyne> GeDaMo: fair enough, I only vaguely know how a heap works
[23:44:28] <GeDaMo> This is not the same as main memory heap
[23:44:55] <Izem> that was always so confusing xD
[23:45:01] <GeDaMo> A heap data structure is a way of storing a tree in an array so you can calculate the index of a child from the index of the parent

[23:45:49] <alycidyne> GeDaMo: right, a heap basically reduces the search domain by ordering the keys instead of explicitly splitting it IIUC?
[23:46:31] *** Joins: gitgood (~gitgood@80-44-9-45.dynamic.dsl.as9105.com)
[23:46:50] <GeDaMo> I'm not sure what you mean by 'explicitly splitting it'
[23:48:06] <alycidyne> GeDaMo: i.e. storing a table per directory

[23:48:55] <GeDaMo> Is this related to your filesystem thing?
[23:49:34] <alycidyne> GeDaMo: partly, yes
[23:50:18] <d3x0r> if you always restart from the beginning it can take some time - but you can keep a cache of what you already got - or even just where you are now... then you only need to find relatively close things

[23:51:59] <alycidyne> d3x0r: from what I understood, since a heap orders keys, this reduces the search domain in a manner similar to an explicit directory

[23:53:14] <alycidyne> or rather, allows reducing the search domain at each node on the path

[23:54:37] <alycidyne> For example, the original HFS has thread records which store the file name and the ID of the parent directory, so it sounds a lot like a heap per what I'm currently understanding
[23:54:47] <alycidyne> (Macintosh HFS, I mean)

[23:57:37] <GeDaMo> A heap is just a way of storing a tree in an array, it has some advantages over pointer-based tree implementations
