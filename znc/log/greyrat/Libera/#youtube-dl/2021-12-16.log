[00:00:59] <ede> KillerWasp: and small, so more in the buffer for jumps
[00:01:01] <KillerWasp> i find better with 244+140, more where the videos now are 4K or 8K. :/
[00:01:28] <KillerWasp> (or very high size)
[00:02:04] <ede> can't even play 4k here, 2k is the limit and this only when i don't twitter or stream or sth
[00:10:00] <qjsgkem> yeah, usually when I stumble across such a pixel bomb, I limit to 720p despite having 1920x1080 screen.

[01:09:56] <qjsgkem> oh, believe me, that guy's on a roll, and in those 100 minutes I had a lot of fun and learned a lot about some dark places.
[01:11:51] <qjsgkem> trust me, please. I knew that Andrew Wakefield was an asshole, but thru that vid I learned that he truly is a fractal of assholiness. plus I love the video author's presentation, desp[ite being slightly adhdey
[01:13:04] <KillerWasp> 1 hour 10 minutes for download the video, still need the audio
[01:13:25] <KillerWasp> it take like 30 minutes more
[01:13:32] <ede> KillerWasp: the default fix it to use yt-dlp for the moment
[01:13:55] <ede> as mentioned in that PR they use the android api
[01:14:45] <qjsgkem> KillerWasp: I do feel slighty sorry about that now. should've warned you or pasted nice music instead. still hoping you will enjoy!

[21:40:06] <mago> Someone suggested using an alternate youtube-dl version..
[21:40:12] <ede> in linux the trick would be to do -- "$id" since -- introduces the names only area

[21:46:08] <mago> So would changing %dl% for $id work?
[21:48:49] <ede> nah, that's syntax for bash (and some other linux shells and also languages)

[22:00:02] <ede> on the contrary, they're as active ay youtube-dl during its best times and added another shitload of options

[22:20:31] <mago> Ok, need help with the -S --file-format option asr.. How does it work?
[22:35:23] <nimaje> "frag" should refer to fragments as modern video streaming is mostly done by linking to many small fragments and the player can then download these fragments one after the other and can easily dynamically change the format while playing (e.g. choosing a format with lower quality because the network is slow); but no idea why the download is slow for you
