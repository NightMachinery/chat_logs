[01:08:09] <Myself> A friend of mine had severe night terrors, reached the point of taking way too much sleeping-aid to be able to basically crash through them and fall asleep
[01:08:14] <unfinity> ・゜ ​ ゜・。。・゜゜\​_o< QUAC​K!
[01:08:46] <Myself> finally went to see a doctor, who was like "oh that's a form of epilepsy, here let's try a very low dose of this epilepsy drug" and BLAM completely gone

[01:09:58] <Myself> the doctor explained (and I'm paraphrasing here, third-hand and years ago) that epilepsy is basically a short-circuit in the brain and sometimes it manifests as thrashing around, sometimes it manifests as sudden feelings of dread and danger, sometimes it manifests as the feeling that something has happened before
[01:10:46] <Myself> So yeah, deja vu is the same mechanism as seizures, just at a different strength and in a different part of the brain. That blew my mind.
[01:30:11] <evilgohan2> no shit?
[01:30:24] <evilgohan2> deja vu functions on the mechanism of seizures?
[01:30:26] <evilgohan2> Interesting.

[17:19:44] <brimstone> does it stop forever, or just a short while?

[19:02:32] <evilgohan2> dTal: It's been a while since I've really been involved with bittorrent in any capacity, but those kind of things sound a lot like it might be a client-side issue. What client are you using and have you tried another?
[19:02:33] <Myself> that's peculiar, I've used bittorrent for exactly that sort of work and it's performed as expected
[19:03:09] <Myself> yeah, different clients would be my next step as well

[19:11:24] <dTal> qBitTorrent was the client.
[19:12:05] <dTal> Well, there was a transmission-daemon in the mix as well, which seemed to behave the same. I never got *that* one to connect to the server at all.

[19:18:22] <evilgohan2> Interesting. I used uTorrent way back when.
[19:18:42] <evilgohan2> I have a VM running with rTorrent that serves (literal) linux isos.
[19:18:56] <evilgohan2> One thing I found is that I cannot use DHT. It crashes my rTorrent.
[19:19:15] <evilgohan2> and, for what I'm seeding, I never cared enough to fix it lol
[19:19:39] <evilgohan2> I digress. It sounds a lot like this is indeed a client issue.
[19:20:07] <evilgohan2> I admittedly don't know how to resolve this for you. You might want to try something else such as rsync if that's an option.

[21:00:33] <evilgohan2> your reminder that Halle Berry is 55.
[21:01:04] <ThePendulum> true but she looks 36
[21:01:08] <evilgohan2> Exactly.
[21:02:15] <evilgohan2> The money aspect was to point out that they likely have a significant lower amount of stress in their life. They don't necesssarily have to worry about things like bills, health care, etc.
[21:03:02] <evilgohan2> likewise, generally speaking, persons with higher collagen and melanin content tend to show signs of aging (i.e.: skin lines, cracks, wrinkles) to a significantly lesser degree than those with fairer skin.
