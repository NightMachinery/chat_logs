[04:17:25] <scara> Does anyone here have a solar panel? I'm wondering how possible it is without prorietary software (firmware excluded).
[04:18:04] <vertbyqb[m]> i don't have one, but i doubt you even need software for a solar panel
[04:19:37] <scara> I just saw a video by LTT so it got me intrested, it seems like a lot of these systems have some kind of app, maby thay're not required?
[04:20:44] <DiffieHellman> That's not required, but it's "hip" for inverters to be IoT and connect over Wi-Fi to send information to a proprietary cr..app
[04:20:50] *** Quits: Bilange (~Bilange@fsf/member/Bilange) (Quit: I'll be Bach)

[06:17:57] <Noisytoot> catt[m]: Class files are compiled to native code at runtime. Java files aren't compiled to class files, which are JVM bytecode files, at runtime.

[06:18:20] <DiffieHellman> Yes, you cannot magically replicate a proprietary game without very hard work.

[06:24:40] <DiffieHellman> But minetest is currently the most complete similar program, so it would be best to build on top of it. It's always possible to add non-lua plugins to it.
[06:24:59] <catt[m]> DiffieHellman: True, minecraft devs are busy on the implementation most of the time
[06:25:13] <DiffieHellman> catt[m]: Mechnical typrewriters have nothing to do with software, so this the wrong channel to ask really.
[06:25:29] <catt[m]> DiffieHellman: Is it freedom respecting
[06:25:42] <DiffieHellman> The design of that typewriter is proprietary unless you have the designs under a free license.
[06:25:45] <fossdev2> DiffieHellman: but i can't find any way without lua
[06:25:56] <catt[m]> DiffieHellman: Well its easy to repair

[06:26:09] <catt[m]> It respects my privacy right
[06:26:15] <DiffieHellman> fossdev2: Yes, the default is lua, but if you adjust the sepples, you can add plugins in different languages.
[06:26:38] <DiffieHellman> catt[m]: The typewriter respects your freedom to write, as it won't stop writing no matter what you write.

[06:28:44] <catt[m]> X11
[06:29:01] <DiffieHellman> I would reccommend against using X11.
[06:29:07] <DiffieHellman> Probably use SDL2 instead.
[06:29:15] <catt[m]> SDL2?
[06:29:18] <Noisytoot> I would recommend against requiring any version of OpenGL newer than 2.1
[06:29:19] <catt[m]> Is this cross platform
[06:29:23] <Noisytoot> Yes
[06:29:30] <catt[m]> Noisytoot: I heard that using openGL is hell
[06:29:34] <catt[m]> So i dont want to use it
[06:29:35] <DiffieHellman> Noisytoot: Nah, just require at least OpenGL 4.1.
[06:29:57] <DiffieHellman> catt[m]: Well, you're doing 3D. OpenGL supports 3D much better than X11.
[06:30:11] <catt[m]> I dont want to depend on overcomplicated things
[06:30:13] <Noisytoot> DiffieHellman: Is there any GPU that works without nonfree firmware and supports OpenGL 4.1?
[06:30:15] <catt[m]> I heard opengl is complicated
[06:30:17] <Noisytoot> catt[m]: https://libsdl.org/
[06:30:24] <catt[m]> And developing opengl C is hard from what i heard
[06:30:37] <catt[m]> Thats why most people make their games in C#/C++

[06:31:06] <Noisytoot> It'll probably be harder with just X11
[06:31:16] <DiffieHellman> Use SDL2+OpenGL probably, or SDL2+vulkan.
[06:31:31] <catt[m]> Vulkan better right
[06:31:45] <DiffieHellman> Vulkan is faster, but it's even harder to use.
[06:31:55] <DiffieHellman> Vulkan is the OpenGL replacement.
[06:32:02] <Noisytoot> Is there any GPU that works without nonfree firmware and supports Vulkan?
[06:32:03] <catt[m]> Oh

[08:00:26] <qrpnxz> it just occurred to me that GPL allows tivoization of works in source form. You can be both prevented form looking at the source and form running modified versions if the device executes the source directly.
[08:00:37] <qrpnxz> s/form/from/
[08:01:02] <DiffieHellman> No it doesn't?
[08:01:25] <qrpnxz> the anti-tivo stuff only applies to object form distribution
[08:01:29] <qrpnxz> look at the license
[08:01:47] <DiffieHellman> If you can't see the source, that's not compliance.
[08:02:08] <qrpnxz> they don't have to give you another copy of the source, they never gave you an object form
[08:04:15] <DiffieHellman> If you can't see the source, that's not source code.
[08:05:04] <qrpnxz> ok let's say the chip is readable then, now you have the source
[08:05:54] <DiffieHellman> As long as you trivially read it, sure.
[08:06:36] <qrpnxz> and the problem persists

[08:08:47] <DiffieHellman> The GPLv3 doesn't have anything against read-only chips with GPL programs in them, yes.
[08:09:11] <DiffieHellman> The device just can't stop you if you decide to swap out that chip with a modified version.
[08:11:19] <qrpnxz> well actually it can, but i'm not saying read only. I'm saying if you have a tivoization scenario, the anti-tivo stuff is only for object form, so if you tivo source form there doesn't seem to be anything to stop them

[08:12:09] <DiffieHellman> I'm pretty sure the anti-tivo stuff doesn't mention object code or source form.
[08:13:00] <DiffieHellman> Oh, it says object code
[08:13:24] <DiffieHellman> Actually no, that's about a user product
[08:13:32] <qrpnxz> it's in section six on conveying non-source forms "If you convey an object code work under this section in..."

[08:13:57] <qrpnxz> yes in a user product (i.e. a tivo)
[08:14:59] <DiffieHellman> Section 6 just talks about object code forms.
[08:15:41] <qrpnxz> yes, that's where all anti-tivo stuff is
[08:16:19] <DiffieHellman> Hmm, I reckon that if you flash source code to a chip, and that source code is machine readible, then that counts as object code,
[08:16:32] <qrpnxz> how could it count as object code
[08:16:35] <qrpnxz> it's source code

[08:18:16] <qrpnxz> Object code in the gpl means non source, gpl defines all it's own terms
[08:18:22] <qrpnxz> its not just for software
[08:18:33] <DiffieHellman> Pretty much, source code is readable and modifable in place.
[08:18:51] <qrpnxz> it doesn't have to be modifiable in place
[08:18:52] <DiffieHellman> If it's not readable and modifable in place, it's not source code.
[08:19:09] <qrpnxz> also, tivo chips were modifiable in place as well, that wasn't the problem
[08:19:30] <qrpnxz> in fact, this clause only triggers if it's modifiable, if it's read-only, the gpl doesn't care
[08:19:39] <DiffieHellman> Lemme append.
[08:20:06] <DiffieHellman> If it's not readable and modifible in place and once you modify it correctly it still works, it's not source code.

[08:25:58] <qrpnxz> I don't see how that makes sense. It's the preferred form for modification. Not having the crypto keys to get that device to run it doesn't change that. If you consider those keys part of the source code, then the GPL 2 alone takes care of tivoization
[08:26:54] <DiffieHellman> Yes, the GPLv2 takes care of tivoization, but they do it anyway as it doesn't mention it, plus no-one (outside of a guy in Germany) demands that they comply with the requirements.
[08:27:24] <qrpnxz> no it doesn't. FSF recognized that GPL doesn't take care of it. That's why they had to change the license.
[08:27:36] <qrpnxz> if it did no change would be needed
[08:27:57] <DiffieHellman> The FSF recognized that enforcing the GPLv2 against tivotization was quite difficult, so they changed the license to make it far easier.
[08:28:18] <qrpnxz> RMS said himself that they formally comply, not that it was hard. That they complied

[08:35:39] <qrpnxz> I could write a program for a machine that doesn't exist, and is therefore not practically executable anywhere, and that would still be source code.

[09:18:49] <qrpnxz> thanks a lot a lot for sharing that, really informative. I had some intuition for the install wording the GPL (both version) but i wasn't aware of the rich compliance history, and explicit intent, behind those words. Good job version 2! I still think GPL 3 (and the way LGPL works) is a significant upgrade in several other ways, but it interesting to see how really minor the tivo difference really is. I could argue it wasn't 
[09:18:49] <qrpnxz> even worth it because it helped create (or at least didn't help prevent) license incompatibilities from people rejecting GPL 3. (Version 4 really ought to make forward compat required)

[21:51:50] <qrpnxz> An major issue for me with the AGPL is that right now it's not so clear what is a complete work when talking about web applications. I was thinking that if the front-end of the service is GPL, that may actually be enough to require the Corresponding Source of the back-end (the more intimate, the more obvious this seems). Some evidence is that right now there are AGPL projects that try to comply with AGPL by using the 
[21:51:50] <qrpnxz> front-end. Front-end has the notice and source link, implying that it's part of the work which is required to do that.
[21:51:50] <qrpnxz> A problem consequence with that is that that would make things like invidious illegal (unless they are using an official API meant to interact with 3rd parties), because that makes them derivative works of YouTube for example, which is not at all designed to work with anything other than their proprietary javascript, but it makes sense and would help AGPL be effective.
[21:51:54] <qrpnxz> If the front-end is not part of the work, then AGPL is not as impactful, because a back-end can't really prominently offer front-end users anything. Hence, you could build a proprietary front-end and never mention the back-end. Some ways the back-end could try to make it's source known is always having a link to it somewhere in responces to its API. For example, as an HTTP header, or as part of payloads, on calls to necessary 
[21:51:59] <qrpnxz> or common end-points, or as part of some informational data in the beginning of a connection.

[22:44:38] <qrpnxz> I'm warming up to the AGPL because I see more clearly what it's about and how it wants to accomplish that. It's not just about viewing the code someone else is running, it's about Corresponding Source; that is its goal is that you can run the service yourself, even if you don't have the data associated with it (for example, the video catalog). Like getting a libre audio workstation without samples. That's definitely a kind of 
[22:44:38] <qrpnxz> freedom.

[22:57:08] <qrpnxz> Seems like RMS is really advocating then for a more complete kind of computational independence. If we try to generalize I think, well, what about other kinds of independence. Should my vegetables come with a manual on how to plant the seeds and grow the plant myself? Should the bakery include a recipe with its cakes? If providing that kind of freedom is imperative those seem like logical consequences.

[23:04:42] <AnimalClatter> qrpnxy: I'm a lurker and I'm barely paying attention, so pardon me if I'm interrupting something I'm not aware of, but it seems to me that with the bakery/cakes analogy, it would be more instructive to imagine ovens that are locked down at the factory to only work with proprietary food packages.

[23:06:14] <AnimalClatter> Or maybe food products that don't come with any ingredients/nutrition labeling?
[23:07:00] <qrpnxz> If I receive an appliance that's a User Product and of course I should have freedom over that. I'm more talking about Cakes as a Service. Where I go to a bakery to get a cake. AGPL underlying philosophy is I should be able to run a service myself, so why not also freedom over my cooking?
