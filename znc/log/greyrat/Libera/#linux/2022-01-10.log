[00:59:37] <NGC3982> it's one of my hardest walls to climb when trying to progress
[00:59:47] <ayecee> it's encouraged when it's methodical. it's considered dumb when it consists of changing things at random until it works
[00:59:47] <gry> some people consider "using linux" dumb
[00:59:48] <luizfrds> hi people! I have an application that i wrote that starts when the system boot up with the systemd services, but it needs a env var to be set, where i can set this variable so my application can reach it?
[00:59:52] <gry> it is pretty useless
[00:59:53] <hexnewbie> It's for work, so I couldn't share it, but was needed to xz the individual files, yet do the same as rsync does (and seemed easier than writing a FUSE filesystem that uses xz, to rsync into)
[00:59:58] <gry> hi luizfrds

[01:02:46] <Blondie101010> luizfrds:  you need to pass your environment information or source explicitely somewhere

Most of the times, it just reads the tree, and copies several text files. To verify I want the changes, I run it with --dry-run -v, then run again without, and the second crawl wastes a second crawling (20 seconds on SSD, several minutes on HDD).

I noticed that SUSE, in their datasheets, announce that SUSE Server has minimum requirements 1 G RAM and 2 G disk (8.5 G for all patterns), and SUSE Enterprise Micro (for containers and VM) has minimum 2 G RAM and 12 G disk. However, I have had these AWS cloud servers for a while with SUSE (I think it's definitely the enterprise level server SUSE and not openSUSE). It's very typical that my memory
[03:10:30] <Thaurwylth> size ...
[03:10:32] <Thaurwylth> ... minus 'available' is in the league of 300-400 MB and the system has had a disk footprint of 3.3 GB for a long time. How come? Is SUSE more economical than it claims to be? (With system resources, not related to pricing.)
[03:10:52] <ayecee> can i get a tl;dr

[03:50:43] <Dagmar> SOMETHING has to be "the bottleneck"

[03:52:40] <ayecee> challenge accepted!

[04:54:13] <VanUnamed> reinstalling fixed it
[04:54:15] <VanUnamed> but why
[04:54:26] <catbeard> did you update firefox recently with it still open?

[04:54:33] <tieinv> mint 15 is a bit old ?
[04:54:36] <VanUnamed> I, did nothing. it did it by itself
[04:54:45] <catbeard> ok but was firefox open at the time
[04:54:54] <catbeard> when the binary was replaced
[04:55:26] <VanUnamed> yes
[04:55:34] <catbeard> if so i might report that to ##linuxmint
[04:55:43] <catbeard> and they could report it upstream to mozilla
[04:55:43] <Dagmar> Mint 15 was EOL some time ago so it's rather likely that package was NOT from an official repo that expected anyone would install it
[04:56:06] <Dagmar> ...and by "some time ago" I do mean 2014.

[04:56:46] <oerheks> catbeard,  did you try a clean session with ~/.mozilla removed?

[04:58:40] <djph> VanUnamed: no, it is no longer an "out of the box" DE
[04:58:41] <Ismael_> Or use Kubuntu.
[04:58:55] <catbeard> *cough* install gentoo */cough*
[04:59:02] <VanUnamed> sounds complicated
[04:59:06] <catbeard> yes
[04:59:06] <Dagmar> DOing an all-at-once upgrade from 15 to 20 is very likely to fail hard
[04:59:31] <catbeard> yeah, make backups first
[04:59:33] <Ismael_> Yeah, it has to be step-by-step but it's tedious so not worth it.
[04:59:38] <Dagmar> 18 to 20 is "iffy" and I don't think the parts are still around to do the upgrade in stages from 15 to 16 then 16 to 17 and on up to 20
[04:59:45] <VanUnamed> how do i see what version i run
[04:59:50] <djph> Dagmar: it's impossible.  THere were massive changes from 13 -> 17 and also 17 -> 18 that ... well ... aren't there
[04:59:54] <Dagmar> Usually `cat /etc/*release*`
[05:00:03] <catbeard> perhaps update the source.list file with the 15 -> 16 replacements and do them in order

[05:00:53] <catbeard> Dagmar: oh i see, not an issue on straight debian i guess, depends what you're doing
[05:00:58] <djph> well, at least 18.3 might have a chance of updating to 19
[05:01:02] <djph> _MIGHT_
[05:01:02] <Dagmar> There was a separate set of programs written just to make things like 18 -> 19 happen safely

[07:26:16] <sheep> pingpongball: you won't break dependencies as long as you always do a full upgrade with pacman -Syu. When people break depdendencies it's almost always because they mixed -Sy and packages installations without using a full -S(y)u
[07:26:27] <rascul> pnbeast is a time complexity
[07:26:52] <pingpongball> :/  oh i see.
[07:26:55] <sheep> pingpongball: flatpak still requires installing dependencies, and depending on how things are packaged for flatpak, you may have many copies of the dependencies installed, but pacman will only need to install one copy for the whole system
[07:27:47] <pingpongball> i love gnome but i wanted a minimalistic type, like gdm feels like unneceesary dont you think, but to run that screelock we need to have gdm anyway

[09:00:44] <sheep> on windows, it's usually expected that an application provides all of the libraries that it needs even if other applications on the system also use that library. On Linux, the package manager places a single copy of a shared library in a shared location so that all of the applications that use it can use the shared copy

[15:30:47] <pingpongball> cerl : That bash scripting is great. I'll graps it in just hour. But what to do after that.

[15:30:59] <OnkelTem> tirnanog: I spent time configuring OBS Studio to make a video with my marvels but you see, hidden files was the answer LOL
[15:31:35] <cerl> Well once you get the hang of bash scripting, you can make your own scripts. What do YOU want to do with bash? pingpongball.
[15:31:55] <pingpongball> KDE  , does KDE screen lock works if i disable login manager such as lightdm or gdm , and use tty mode.
[15:32:09] <OnkelTem> Bash scripting is pure evil in its primodial form pingpongball !
[15:32:23] <OnkelTem> Just try to avoid that :)
[15:32:27] <djph> pingpongball: if you're only in a tty, _nothing_ graphical is in the mix.
[15:32:29] <tirnanog> OnkelTem: yeah. I normally use find in the case that the containing directory should stay. it's safer than fiddling with shell globs. besides, there's another potential issue with shell globs; if the glob expands to too many pathnames, it can exceed the maximum number of arguments allowed to be conveyed.
[15:32:31] <pingpongball> aumm I'm searching for my interest on programming langauge . tried many
[15:32:46] <cerl> Bash is not a programming language, it's a scripting language.
[15:32:57] <pingpongball> djph: tty i mean that login only , which after login goes into de/wm
[15:33:06] <cerl> Often you call external programs with bash rather than use builtin commands.
[15:33:09] <SheepBarber> cerl: what's the difference
[15:33:23] <OnkelTem> tirnanog: yeah, I'm aware of that last one. Every time I see unquoted '*' I feel a bit of stress
[15:33:32] <djph> pingpongball: no, a tty is text only.  Or do you mean you're starting a graphical shell after the fact (e.g. "startx" or whatever wayland uses)
[15:33:32] <cerl> Scripting is usually smaller and less complex to solve a single task at hand.
[15:33:57] <SheepBarber> is complexity part of a language or of a problem
[15:33:58] <tirnanog> OnkelTem: that being said, bash does have a dotglob option. not something I would recommend keeping on in an interactive session, though.
[15:34:14] <OnkelTem> pingpongball: just use nodejs, python, rust. (The last one I didn't use personally though)
[15:34:21] <djph> "scripting" tends to be a bit of "glue language" to get something done, rather than ... well, writing a whole program
[15:34:27] <cerl> Complexity is more of an opinion. It's your preference on how complex bash is or isn't or  how complex you want it to be.

[15:34:50] <pingpongball> yes right djph  I'm in gnome, but i find that gdm to be unnecessary, i wanted a rather just a text based (less bloated, simple) login manger . But i found those screenlock wouldnt work if i remove gdm in gnome.
[15:34:51] <cerl> Rust is a programming language.
[15:35:12] <SheepBarber> I mean I use rust every day, given having excercised with ti

I've got a situation where stdout is lost and pstree shows that the process is spawned as a child of PID 1 (php-fpm in this case), not of supervisord.

[16:55:43] <pikaro> well, FWIW, the created log doesn't contain the output I'm looking for, either. unfortunately, I'm not that well-versed in these lower-level mechanics - I don't know how and why exactly the new process ends up under PID 1. does PID 1 have to be forked for that, necessarily? otherwise, the -ff wouldn't do anything and strace wouldn't see the output, either. the output of php-fpm itself is already
[16:55:44] <pikaro> logged, ob course - that also appears in the strace.

[20:44:26] <tirnanog> andersmmg: do you have some plan in mind as to how the second drive will be used?
[20:45:15] <andersmmg> tirnanog: I have one 1tb drive for most files and storage for games and stuff, and an ssd 256gb for things like linux itself and bootloader

[20:46:57] <ornxka> why my ssd reports 512b sector size and not 4k?
[20:46:59] <tirnanog> as an aside, I know that steam has the capability to select different storage locations built int.

[20:48:52] <akik> andersmmg: can you select the boot device in your bios/uefi? which one are you using now as the boot device?
[20:48:58] <din0> sysRPL does the VPN software live on the same system as the deluge client or away from it
[20:49:14] <tusko> openvpn is for lames
[20:49:21] <sysRPL> that is for example, you have a vpn on and are running deluge and you turn off the vpn ... at that point deluge would be automatically killed if it was running
[20:49:23] <andersmmg> tirnanog: ah okay, so I wouldn't have any problems changing the mount points?
[20:49:31] <tirnanog> ornxka: the erase block size is commonly kept a secret (and isn't necessarily 4096 for that matter). so, 512e is typical and you let the flash translation layer worry about it.
[20:49:35] <sysRPL> din0: yes
[20:49:44] <tusko> deluge is for lames
[20:49:48] <andersmmg> akik: it's currently running Windows, booting from the ssd
[20:50:01] <sysRPL> i mean i can write a software tool that does this, but i was wondering if linux had a way to do this for me automatically
[20:50:06] <din0> sysRPL can you set deluge to only listen for an IP or interface that the VPN creates, and if that interface doesn't exist then deluge would fail to start (assuming the VPN software runs on the same system as deluge)

[20:51:35] <din0> It would require a bit of testing, for instance, if deluge is looking for `tun0` and it doesn't exist, does it ignore it and tries to listen for another interface or does it give up and die

[20:52:56] <tirnanog> andersmmg: this strategy would entail mounting the large filesystem somewhere - let's say /mnt/hdd as an example - then making various sub-tree seamlessly appear to be elsewhere within the filesystem heirarchy at the same time. for example, "mount -o bind /mnt/hdd/steam ~/.local/share/steam" would make the contents of /mnt/hdd/steam appear to be present at ~/.local/share/steam. so you have a good
[20:52:57] <tirnanog> deal of flexibility as to what you want to be stored on the hdd.
[20:53:54] <tirnanog> steam might not be the best example as it already has a storage manager. but still, you can use bind mounts in whatever way you please, and they can be added to /etc/fstab too.

[21:54:47] <matsaman> it's still a pretty straightforward way to do both
[21:54:53] <wikan> BlueSky: but to be notifed there must be an action (fetching of mails). So you need server.

[21:55:51] <ananke> quuky: you do _not_ have to do any checks. they're there if you want them.
[21:56:05] <matsaman> quuky: you really need to get the information for each from somewhere other than the same mirror to increase confidence
[21:56:16] <wikan> BlueSky: yes, thats why checking mail must be moved to daemon.
[21:56:20] <quuky> ananke I know I do not need to do it - as i said, i just wanna understand why they are there
[21:56:24] <freeone3000> quuky: it is feasible that you can generate a change to an ISO that produces a new image with the same hash. (the easy techniques change the size pretty significantly, but who knows). gpg signatures verify that the image was signed by the holder of the key.
[21:56:31] <ananke> quuky: typically gpg signatures are used to ensure authenticity of software, in case if a bad actor compromises distribution system and injects their own version

[22:11:08] <quuky> so why checking integrity?
[22:11:15] <quuky> if authenticity does that job?

[22:11:35] <ananke> quuky: again, for the last time: checking integrity is faster and less cumbersome
[22:11:42] <wikan> guys, about auth and integrity - what to do if it fails?
[22:11:50] <quuky> ananke ok, but then it's not a secure way
[22:11:58] <matsaman> quuky: it doesn't need to be, though
[22:12:01] <ananke> so for situations where speed, processing time, and less complex process - integrity checks may be sufficient
[22:12:26] <ananke> quuky: and who said that security is always #1 factor?
[22:12:35] <matsaman> wikan: find another file and/or check your sums/sigs
[22:12:41] <Duchess> I want to unzip multiple .zip files in a directory and extract them to a specific directory.  How does this command look? "unzip *filename.zip -d /var/www/domaine/public_html/assets"
[22:12:57] <Khaytsus> quuky: Are you here just to randomly argue?
[22:13:01] <uwharrie> Duchess: I'm pretty sure the unzip command can only operate on one file at a time
[22:13:02] <matsaman> Duchess: does it work?
[22:13:17] <ananke> quuky: when I want to verify local backups, I don't care to check authenticity, I just need integrity checks

[22:13:45] <wikan> right, but i guess it should be notifed to someone, right matsaman?

[22:15:35] <ananke> quuky: yes
[22:15:36] <matsaman> I'm sure the Debian install guide has a suggestion
[22:15:42] <quuky> how can i verify it over .iso if theres only .sign for checksum?
[22:15:43] <Duchess> matsaman, merci
[22:15:47] <djph> ananke: ugh ... I need coffee or something ... I'm wording the stupid thing backwards.  My point being that the simple check (integrity / "oh hey the disc has a big damn crack in it") is "good enough"
