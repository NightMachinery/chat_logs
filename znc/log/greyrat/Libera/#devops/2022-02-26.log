[04:12:09] <EdgyMC_69> Hi, I'm starting learning about stuff and I've made jenkins and sonarqube instances with docker and they take a lot of memory. Is it normal for them to use "1.38GB" and "1.46GB" according to docker stats? Is the jvm in the container not returning the memory to the system?
[04:28:45] <lantech19446> you think 1.38Gib and 1.46Gib is a lot of memory? are you missing numbers somewhere? most linux distros couldn't even run with that little memory
[04:32:29] <EdgyMC_69> lantech19446: Well I kind of get your point but at the same time I see containers as only allowing me to use one service and they aren't doing much right now, I would say they are pretty idle. Also, I don't have a dedicated machine, I'm using my home pc which has only 16GB. 
[04:33:16] <EdgyMC_69> I have just read that some master jenkins servers use 70GBs of RAM, so it might be I just think on a different scale. 
[04:35:33] <lantech19446> I think for some of the enterprises using jenkins 70Gib is probably on the low side but in all honesty I've seen chrome use more memory than you're talking about at idle. Maybe I'm way off here but my gut reaction is be thrilled that's all it's using in a time where memory is dirt cheap software engineers don't tend to be memory conservative like they used to be
[04:36:10] <EdgyMC_69> Then I'll have to buy more RAM then. 
[04:36:49] <lantech19446> have you ever thought about buying a used server?
[04:37:33] <EdgyMC_69> Not seriously 
[04:38:54] <lantech19446> might be worth checking out servermonkey.com you can get one on the cheap side that doesn't come with disks or memory and build it up as you get it. Memory will be more expensive for ecc buffered memory but at the same time you can build them up to like 128 gigs of ram and Tib of hard drive space and really do anything you want with it
[04:41:13] <EdgyMC_69> But is it reasonable to buy a server when I wanted to have a local CI pipeline for my Android app?
[04:42:05] <lantech19446> well you're definitely not doing that in your house without a business account so you're probably looking at a dedicated server or vps
[04:44:44] <EdgyMC_69> I don't understand. Why can't I do it without a business account? And for what? Also the cheapest VPS I have seen offers like 1GB of RAM, so it isn't enough for jenkins (but that means I'll just have to rent something more expensive).
[04:46:01] *** Quits: predmijat (~predmijat@mail.strogopro.com) (Quit: bye)
[04:46:04] <lantech19446> you can't do it without a business account because most ISP's don't allow you to run public facing servers without a business account and should you app get bigger you will definitely be exceeding your bandwidth allotment
[04:47:36] *** Joins: predmijat (~predmijat@mail.strogopro.com)
[04:49:09] <EdgyMC_69> Oh, an ISP business account. I never thought about it that way. I only knew I had to buy a public/static IP to get access to my stuff. Btw, I have never bought my own internet access so I don't know much about it. And currently I live in a place where I don't have any control over it so I can't do much about it.
[04:50:07] <lantech19446> yea that could be problematic
[04:50:27] <EdgyMC_69> Maybe it would be better to give some context - I'm a college student living in dorms and I do have a job but it isn't paying that well. At least it's in tech. 
[04:51:27] <EdgyMC_69> I think I'll buy more RAM and see if it will be okay. Thank you for talking with me. 
[04:56:20] <lantech19446> no problem good luck with it

[07:06:21] <bn_work> anyone know if the older non-M1 Mac version of Docker Desktop can be run on an M1 mac?  (I ask as I am finding a plethora of issues getting the M1 Mac version to work)
[07:08:07] <bn_work> I'm assuming the Intel binary version will of course run at 70% Rosetta2 speed but I'm ok with that if it at least allows Docker to work presumably 
[07:29:02] <justsomeguy> (Note to self: This is a good illustration of why I should not assume build scripts will be run locally.)
[07:30:42] * justsomeguy writes too many broken build scripts with the assumption that no network access will ever be involved.
