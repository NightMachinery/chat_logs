[04:24:32] <Nanobot> I'll never use a chiropractor again. I didn't do my research before using one, but there really is no scientific support for chiropractics. The only things they do of value are things that physical therapists also do, usually better.
[04:24:32] <amigojapan> Alright Sumida 
[04:25:24] <amigojapan> Nanobot: craking your back feels good tho.
[04:25:47] <Nanobot> amigojapan: Except when you do something like what Kiara did.
[04:25:55] <amigojapan> Yeah
[04:26:37] <Nanobot> I saw a chiropractor for a whole year for my back. It usually felt better for about half an hour, but the problem overall just got worse at a faster pace during that year.
[04:27:14] <amigojapan> Nanobot: I think the problem is that you were expecting results
[04:27:28] <Nanobot> He kept promising results.
[04:27:38] <amigojapan> If you were just going to enjoy it it would be different
[04:28:14] <amigojapan> Nanobot: yeah. I don't believe in the results either

[04:29:40] <Sumida> still, some people seem to enjoy them
[04:29:44] <Nanobot> Physical therapists also use the zappy things. It's supposed to give a deep tissue massage, but I hate them. They always make me feel more tense, not less. But I guess physical therapists like them because it's less work for the therapist.

[10:14:34] <amigojapan> MelancholyNoises: oh by the way. Other Vtubers were using "graduation"and "retire"interchangeably in a video Nanobot showed me. Eventho the subs only said "graduation"
[10:15:07] <MelancholyNoises> is that surprising?
[10:15:55] <amigojapan> MelancholyNoises: in Japanese they used both ÂºïÈÄÄ and ÂçíÊ•≠
[10:16:16] <MelancholyNoises> yeah but I don't get why that's interesting?
[10:16:34] <MelancholyNoises> idols have been saying ÂçíÊ•≠ since forever, right?
[10:17:01] <amigojapan> The mother day when I did it you said "you are putting different things between quotation marks"
[10:17:31] <amigojapan> Yes MelancholyNoises . But usually cause of age
[10:18:07] <MelancholyNoises> amigojapan: I'm pretty sure that's not true, I think idols graduate in different ways
[10:18:35] <MelancholyNoises> amigojapan: and I meant you kept abusing the scare quotes, wasn't a comment on what they were saying so much as you're punctuation
[10:18:44] <MelancholyNoises> you said like "graduation" and then "retirement" or something
[10:19:04] <MelancholyNoises> it's a pet peeve of mine, you see it a lot from old ladies making posters that don't know what they're doing
[10:19:07] <amigojapan> Alright but the usual reason is becoming too old to fit in a group of young girls
[10:19:51] <MelancholyNoises> amigojapan: I mean that might be the most common reason for an idol to retire, but it certainly isn't the only one, and I'm nearly certain they use retirement for other situations too
[10:20:23] <MelancholyNoises> er
[10:20:25] <MelancholyNoises> use "graduation"
[10:20:27] <MelancholyNoises> now I'm doing it
[10:20:32] <amigojapan> Alright. Not an idol fan. So I can't comment
[10:20:45] <amigojapan> Lol
[10:21:33] <amigojapan> Guess it is kind of an umbrella term
[10:24:27] <amigojapan> According to Google "Graduated¬†= left the group (for whatever reason), usually on good terms.

[10:24:55] <MootPoot> hmm
[10:24:58] * MootPoot is thinking
[10:25:35] * MootPoot is considering swapping out his gaming laptop for a ultrathin laptop
[10:25:39] <amigojapan> What are you thinking MootPoot ?
[10:26:04] <amigojapan> Don't you use it for gaming?
[10:26:11] <MelancholyNoises> what is the virtue of an ultra thin laptop?
[10:26:28] <MelancholyNoises> I feel like people desire thinness for some reason, but I've never felt weighed down by a normal laptop
[10:26:32] <MootPoot> well; yeah...but I have my desktop PC 
[10:26:36] <MootPoot> for gaming
[10:26:48] <amigojapan> MelancholyNoises: portability
[10:26:56] <MelancholyNoises> amigojapan: yeah, everyone says that
[10:27:07] <MelancholyNoises> amigojapan: but I have never understood why ultra thin is any more portable
[10:27:15] <MootPoot> ... because its thin
[10:27:19] <MootPoot> and thin = usually lighter
[10:27:21] <MelancholyNoises> laptops have been plenty portable for like 15 years
[10:27:38] <MootPoot> ehh... like thick laptops today are still kind of noticable that you have them
[10:27:42] <MootPoot> its not an ignorable weight
[10:27:44] <MelancholyNoises> yeah but I mean, non ultra thin laptops are not THAT heavy
[10:28:00] <MootPoot> but the main deal is that I need battery life
[10:28:18] <MootPoot> and traditional normal laptops dont utilize that space for more battery, they utilize it for more SSDs and stuff
[10:28:22] <MootPoot> HDDs*
[10:28:25] <MelancholyNoises> like they don't weigh my backpack down in any real way walking around I mean
[10:28:37] <MelancholyNoises> even old laptops are lighter than, for example, textbooks
[10:29:02] <MootPoot> blame the manufacturers
[10:29:09] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you could keep the MacBook. I think the M1 gives it super battery life
[10:29:16] <MelancholyNoises> MootPoot: I wish you the best in battery life, I'm just railing against the kneejerk thin = sexy = somehow objectively better without thinking about it thing
[10:30:00] <MootPoot> its some marketing wank, but  I'd take a thick laptop with a 15000mah battery and a ultra low power cpu over a superlim with a smaller battery
[10:30:11] <MootPoot> but the problem is all the good components somehow end up in the thin ones
[10:30:21] <MootPoot> good speakers, keyboard, display
[10:30:25] <amigojapan> MelancholyNoises: I ordered a tablet on Amazon prime day and it has not arrived yet
[10:31:32] <MootPoot> what happens with thick laptops is that they just equip them with dedicated GPUS
[10:31:42] <MootPoot> which completly kill battery life
[10:32:05] <MootPoot> so functionally your only option is normal and short battery vs thin and lots of battery
[10:32:31] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  even if I was going to keep the macbook, I would return this one first
[10:32:33] <HubertFarnsworth> btw MelancholyNoises, I can see why you didn't like Sabbath's Theater
[10:33:00] <MootPoot> since I can get a university discount and presumably new macs are coming soon
[10:33:02] <MootPoot> M2 chip
[10:33:24] <HubertFarnsworth> it's something really, makes me think about my own life and past

[10:33:46] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  my university discount reduces the price from 1450 to 1150
[10:34:19] <amigojapan> I see MootPoot 
[10:34:33] <MootPoot> BUT...I've been eyeing the samsung galaxy book go as well
[10:34:39] <MootPoot> if that works out and it releases here
[10:34:50] <MootPoot> I'll try that as my ultra mobile laptop
[10:34:52] <HubertFarnsworth> giving it evil eyes?
[10:34:54] <MootPoot> and sell my gaming laptop
[10:35:38] <MootPoot> but for the most part I dont have any real use for a gaming laptop these days...I might still want to keep it if I go overseas to visit places and I need to work
[10:35:44] <MootPoot> and play games
[10:36:21] <HubertFarnsworth> I bought gaming laptop but haven't played much games
[10:36:24] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I heard that Apple is already planning on blocking certain features to only work on M1 and not on Intel. Being evil as usual
[10:36:42] <MootPoot> back when I went to uni I used the fuck out of my gaming laptop
[10:36:48] <MootPoot> I had 4-6 hour waits before classes
[10:36:55] <MootPoot> would go in the library and play games
[10:37:00] <HubertFarnsworth> what games?
[10:37:07] <HubertFarnsworth> lol?
[10:37:54] <amigojapan> I am too old for games unless it is like shougi or hanafuda
[10:38:00] <MootPoot> mostly like war thunder, some pubg, and sometimes older games
[10:38:06] <MootPoot> that were not that demanding
[10:38:09] <amigojapan> Or poker
[10:39:05] <MelancholyNoises> how about chess/go/mahjong?
[10:39:20] <HubertFarnsworth> or minesweeper
[10:39:26] <amigojapan> MelancholyNoises: well shougi is chess
[10:39:29] <MelancholyNoises> minesweeper isn't fun though
[10:39:34] <MelancholyNoises> it's too luck-based

[10:39:45] <amigojapan> MelancholyNoises: I like minesweeper
[10:39:52] <MootPoot> minesweeper irl
[10:39:58] <HubertFarnsworth> you mean 50/50s?
[10:40:01] <amigojapan> Lol MootPoot 
[10:40:03] <HubertFarnsworth> that's the fun
[10:40:03] <MelancholyNoises> minesweeper irl is even MORE luck based!
[10:40:06] <MelancholyNoises> I don't wanna play
[10:40:49] <amigojapan> MelancholyNoises: Hitachi made a mine sweeping machine. Not much based
[10:41:04] <amigojapan> Not luck based
[10:41:14] <HubertFarnsworth> only if you are a side character MelancholyNoises 
[10:41:16] <MelancholyNoises> not even times where you have some small chance, just in a lot of expert difficulty minesweeper puzzles, there comes a point where you've put effort in but all the remaining walls are bombs and you need to click somewhere in the middle
[10:41:23] <HubertFarnsworth> side characters die early
[10:41:24] <MelancholyNoises> it happens too often and it's extremely frustrating
[10:41:41] <MelancholyNoises> sorry just minesweeper is the worst designed free game
[10:41:48] <MelancholyNoises> although also fuck default solitaire
[10:41:53] <MelancholyNoises> freecell is fine though
[10:41:56] <MelancholyNoises> I like freecell
[10:42:00] <DunceCotus> minescrafter
[10:42:02] <HubertFarnsworth> nah, there is actually lot more to guessing in minesweeper MelancholyNoises 
[10:42:13] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: there really isn't beyond what I said
[10:42:20] <MelancholyNoises> I'm good enough at minesweeper to hate minesweeper
[10:42:45] <MelancholyNoises> it doesn't always happen, but often enough on the expert difficulty ones it becomes provably impossible to advance without guessing
[10:42:52] <HubertFarnsworth> people make calculated guesses based on mine density and no of remaining mines left 
[10:42:52] <MelancholyNoises> and where the guess isn't 50/50, it's a blind guess
[10:43:20] <HubertFarnsworth> well..alright
[10:43:32] <DunceCotus> I feel like ive stepped into a minefield of a convo
[10:43:32] <MelancholyNoises> in a significant number of minesweeper setups you get guesses where there's no way to make a calculated guess
[10:44:03] <HubertFarnsworth> that's true, those are in high difficulty maps
[10:44:09] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: I mean where you MUST click a spot that's not next to an edge, so you don't know about the mine density
[10:44:11] <HubertFarnsworth> expert maps are easy af
[10:44:12] <amigojapan> Lol DunceCotus 
[10:45:02] <MelancholyNoises> maybe things have been relabeled at some point, I grew to hate minesweeper like 20 years ago and haven't tried since
[10:45:08] <MelancholyNoises> but the basic game is the same
[10:45:30] <HubertFarnsworth> I love it!
[10:45:34] <DunceCotus> amigojapan howdy. I watched the Haruhi film (disappearance) -- spooky!
[10:45:35] <MelancholyNoises> and yeah, either you turn down density and it's too easy, or if density makes it interesting, a significant amount of the time it makes it impossible
[10:45:42] <MelancholyNoises> which is why I say it's a poorly designed game
[10:46:09] <HubertFarnsworth> there are no guessing maps of high difficulty too
[10:46:10] <amigojapan> Nice DunceCotus now you know about John Smith?
[10:46:13] <MootPoot> bah
[10:46:21] <MootPoot> I was interested in a 17 inch LG gram
[10:46:31] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: you can't control when that happens though
[10:46:36] <MootPoot> but I need it to charge with USB C / USB PD 
[10:46:43] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: like if there aren't enough mines it just gets easy
[10:46:51] <DunceCotus> amigojapan yessir
[10:46:57] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: I mean, what I'm talking about CAN happen on the small maps too, but it's much less likely due to size
[10:47:06] <amigojapan> Ah good DunceCotus 
[10:47:08] <HubertFarnsworth> you can, you can make custom maps of high diffuclty that doesn't guessing
[10:47:11] <MelancholyNoises> on bigger maps it gets pretty likely
[10:47:28] <MootPoot> pro minesweeper = you eat a lot at an indian resturant; you wait 3 hours, and then your toilet is at the opposite side of a real minefield
[10:47:35] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: like someone deliberately placed the mines so it works, rather than having the computer generate them?
[10:47:42] <MootPoot> thinking under stress
[10:48:12] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: because I'd believe that, but otherwise you're either wrong, or you have a different definition of high difficulty
[10:48:27] <HubertFarnsworth> you know what, forget it 
[10:48:31] <MelancholyNoises> but yeah, if you can now make human-designed puzzles, those would obviously work
[10:48:46] <MelancholyNoises> well I don't know what you're actually saying, worried we're miscommunicating
[10:48:50] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: people seem to like "the disappearance of haruhi suzumiya"
[10:49:22] <MelancholyNoises> but I think what I'm saying is factually just true, although difficulty level might be labelled differently now and is certainly subjective
[10:49:26] <HubertFarnsworth> I was saying there are high difficulty maps which doesn't involve guessing MelancholyNoises 
[10:49:29] <DunceCotus> amigojapan cause its good
[10:49:42] <amigojapan> Yup DunceCotus 
[10:49:55] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: yeah you said that, but what do you mean? Human designed? Or are you talking about mine density
[10:50:19] <amigojapan> !a nagato Yuki chan

[10:50:31] <HubertFarnsworth> not human designed, computer generated
[10:50:35] <MelancholyNoises> what a disappointing show amigojapan
[10:50:46] <HubertFarnsworth> mine density with complicated patterns
[10:50:52] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: that movie is kind of bad, different studio
[10:50:59] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: then I think you're either factually incorrect, or have a different definition of difficulty which may be related to some change in behind the scenes settings
[10:51:14] <amigojapan> MelancholyNoises: what are you talking about?
[10:51:31] <MelancholyNoises> I give up, because I think Saganman isn't actually getting what I'm saying either
[10:51:42] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, I never bothered about it actually. Just took the challenge and played MelancholyNoises 
[10:51:44] <MelancholyNoises> I hate when a conversation just seems like it's repeating
[10:51:59] <amigojapan> MelancholyNoises: what show are you talking about?
[10:52:13] <MelancholyNoises> amigojapan: about the computer game minesweeper
[10:52:23] <MelancholyNoises> amigojapan: oh, I was saying the Nagato Yuki spinoff kind of sucked
[10:52:45] <MelancholyNoises> the movie was great, the romance show though...
[10:52:48] <amigojapan> Ah ok yeah I agree. Strange to call a movie a show
[10:53:07] <DunceCotus> amigojapan you didn't like the Disappearance movie?

[10:53:25] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: there are two
[10:53:41] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I'm not referring to the spin-off series
[10:53:47] <MelancholyNoises> the movie was great, the show sucked
[10:53:48] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the nagato Yuki one is bad
[10:54:08] <amigojapan> Ah ok DunceCotus I loved the first one
[10:54:11] <DunceCotus> I mean the movie isn't perfect
[10:54:20] <DunceCotus> but its cool
[10:54:38] <DunceCotus> its very long but strangely it doesn't feel very long
[10:54:47] <DunceCotus> probably cause its enjoyable to be back in that world
[10:54:57] <MelancholyNoises> now I'm really wondering if they changed something about how minesweeper puzzle generation works behind the scenes, but I don't have windows and i'm not gonna get it
[10:55:27] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I haven't seen the disappearance of nagato yuki
[10:55:37] <DunceCotus> amigojapan the art style looks off

[10:58:39] <MootPoot> they do have very good batteries, I'll give them that
[10:58:41] <ButterNoodle> people showed up
[10:58:41] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: is that where you're playing? because what I'm wondering about would depend on the implementation, not the rules of the game

[10:59:50] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I bought a super old toughbook for about 60usd. It works with Linux
[10:59:50] <DunceCotus> MootPoot yes perhaps I am biased
[10:59:50] <MootPoot> new macbook airs and ultrabooks can pull off 15hrs no problem
[10:59:54] <HubertFarnsworth> I think they would know that
[11:00:04] <DunceCotus> MootPoot yeah but then you gotta deal with Mac
[11:00:11] <MootPoot> ultrabooks too
[11:00:21] <dfch> I double the toughbook, one of the best rugged tablets I ever had
[11:00:28] <HubertFarnsworth> they are most likely to know that

[11:01:36] <MootPoot> you have to go through special suppliers
[11:01:52] <HubertFarnsworth> why bad day MelancholyNoises?
[11:01:52] <MelancholyNoises> too many additional causes for stress there
[11:01:58] <MootPoot> looking online at one, a budget toughbook brand new is about 2000usd
[11:02:32] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: my birthday is coming up which always makes me unhappy, combined with I've had a really shitty year and had 3 days to have basically the most productive 3 days in months
[11:02:32] <dfch> latitude 7220ex is a total beast
[11:02:45] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: 3 days where basically everything was perfect in a way that's true once in a blue moon
[11:02:48] <amigojapan> MootPoot: yeah. In Japan I think it is easier
[11:03:03] <MootPoot> panasonic dosen't really sell stuff here anymore afaik
[11:03:07] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: and in those 3 days I've spent maybe 30 hours sitting down trying to get stuff done, and got maybe 1 hour of actual work done
[11:03:12] <dfch> MootPoot, android a3 should be in $1500 range
[11:03:23] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: I spent about 8 hours on something that I then figured out I didn't need to do at all, but only after I'd wasted a long time on it
[11:03:34] <MootPoot> but for me, if I was going to blow money = lg gram 17, otherwise xps 13 or macbook air, or cheapo galaxy book go

[11:11:10] <DunceCotus> MootPoot its both
[11:11:35] <MootPoot> astrology is random claims about human nature based on looking at the starts

[11:13:35] <MootPoot> nice
[11:13:41] <HubertFarnsworth> MelancholyNoises: I am 33 years old
[11:13:42] <Sadale> Nah some are a bit older
[11:13:43] <MootPoot> she doing ok?
[11:13:51] <Sadale> Users like amigojapan's rather old
[11:14:00] <emmeka> she's ok enough to not be in a hospital. but she will now be on medication for life.
[11:14:00] <Sadale> IIRC there's another older user here that I couldn't remember his name
[11:14:04] <MelancholyNoises> EMMEKA!
[11:14:05] <Sadale> oh I think that's emmeka 
[11:14:17] <emmeka> I'm not that old.
[11:14:19] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: yeah I'm going to be 35 I think?
[11:14:21] <HubertFarnsworth> that's good emmeka, I hope she get wells soon

[11:40:29] <HubertFarnsworth> Just being in hospital is stressful.
[11:40:35] <theholyduck> Dismount the drive it was on to prevent writes
[11:40:52] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: then Google how to do it for your fs
[11:40:53] <ButterNoodle> theholyduck: yep, but I just booted nas and started copying it back over :)
[11:41:01] <ButterNoodle> photorec is a pita
[11:41:08] <ButterNoodle> or whatever tool is similar
[11:41:17] <theholyduck> Backups work aswell 
[11:41:19] <ButterNoodle> *I have done it
[11:41:21] <HubertFarnsworth> What the dickens? 5TB manga? Damn, that‚Äôs a lot for manga.
[11:41:30] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: I just did a really fun sudoku-like puzzle, maybe you'd like it?
[11:41:32] <ButterNoodle> I think I have 20 HubertFarnsworth..
[11:41:49] <ButterNoodle> idk.. more than I'll get to read in this lifetime probably
[11:42:00] <theholyduck> Most of it hentai ofcourse 
[11:42:09] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: only manga or doujinshi too?
[11:42:09] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: was just thinking about logic puzzles and the like earlier, and I'd stumbled on this
[11:42:17] <ButterNoodle> no.. this is the non ero collection
[11:42:36] <HubertFarnsworth> High quality manga ButterNoodle?
[11:42:37] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: a human designed puzzle, it's a bit weirder than the computer designed ones: https://cracking-the-cryptic.web.app/sudoku/BjMn9Gnfnn
[11:42:37] <ImoutoBot> [title] Cracking the Cryptic
[11:42:41] <ButterNoodle> I think theres maybe 2tb of eroge
[11:42:46] <ButterNoodle> HubertFarnsworth: its all kinds
[11:42:56] <ButterNoodle> hand scans from the 90's in there too
[11:44:58] <HubertFarnsworth> Nice MelancholyNoises, so I asked the peeps i know about minesweeper high difficulty. He is saying high difficulty will also makes games means they are not just higher mine density but also increased ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù which is not related to mine density.
[11:45:29] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: I didn‚Äôt even know there were hand scans.
[11:45:38] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: so it sounds like, at least from this implementation, things are different than they used to be
[11:45:57] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: so it's possible that what I said WAS true, and what you said is true NOW and so we're both right
[11:46:04] <HubertFarnsworth> I didn‚Äôt know you read that much manga ButterNoodle. How come we never talk about it.
[11:46:29] <ButterNoodle> I dont read as much anymore HubertFarnsworth :| I dont have a lot of time
[11:47:26] <MelancholyNoises> HubertFarnsworth: anyway so this puzzle is like a sudoku but the numbers between the lines mean that's the difference between the numbers in those boxes
[11:47:28] <ButterNoodle> a lot of it is data hording.. I see something and grab it bc... someday I may want to read it
[11:47:35] <MelancholyNoises> and the puzzles are all man-made rather than generated
[11:47:42] <MelancholyNoises> so they have kind of a different flow to them
[11:47:45] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: I love chibi insertions in manga, not completely chibi manga but but using chibi for comical purposes like darling wa namamono ni tsuki
[11:47:56] <ButterNoodle> youtube is bad too, I watch people talk about manga and then add that stuff too
[11:48:11] <MelancholyNoises> ButterNoodle: also every manga I have ever recommended is gold
[11:48:39] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: have you read l-dk? Horimiya?

[11:50:58] <MelancholyNoises> I'm the same except at this point it's almost part of my reading plan
[11:51:03] <ButterNoodle> kinda my issue now... 
[11:51:12] <MelancholyNoises> I read ongoing manga in binges, like I wait until several chapters are out and read all at once
[11:51:27] <MelancholyNoises> although sometimes I put them off too long

[11:52:23] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: try tower of god, it is good but manwha.
[11:52:47] <ButterNoodle> ik, I watched the anime - I think the anime may have spoiled it
[11:52:56] <ButterNoodle> was good for what they adapted of it
[11:53:22] <HubertFarnsworth> The anime is more like prologue and also lot of details missed.

[12:50:57] <S_T_A_N> but also investment
[12:51:28] <ButterNoodle> in a market where all real estate is over inflated
[12:51:42] <ButterNoodle> by at least 30%
[12:51:46] <S_T_A_N> It's a manufactured house

[12:53:37] <ButterNoodle> but if, flat metal roof and wheels
[12:53:44] <ButterNoodle> those depreciate
[12:53:50] <HubertFarnsworth> Think it over. Those loans take a long time to pay. It is a big commitment.
[12:53:52] <S_T_A_N> Looks like flat metal roof
[12:54:14] <S_T_A_N> HubertFarnsworth, it's very reasonably priced. 
[12:54:24] <S_T_A_N> In this market 
[12:54:27] <ButterNoodle> is the property worth what ur paying? because thats a guaranteed appreciation
[12:54:47] <S_T_A_N> That I don't know and I don't know how to judge
[12:54:54] <ButterNoodle> how much land?
[12:55:19] <HubertFarnsworth> Only land gets appreciation, the building doesn‚Äôt
[12:55:24] <S_T_A_N> All I know is I would basically live in it for free with how much I can charge my friend in rent
[12:55:30] <ButterNoodle> HubertFarnsworth: building does in america
[12:55:51] <emmeka> ButterNoodle depends what he means by manufactured home, though
[12:56:03] <HubertFarnsworth> Why? As the buildings gets older, there‚Äôs lot of issues.
[12:56:03] <emmeka> mobile homes depreciate in value, unlike houses.
[12:56:10] <ButterNoodle> for some reason we think older homes are worth the same as new ones
[12:56:18] <S_T_A_N> ButterNoodle, it's basically no land really
[12:56:24] <HubertFarnsworth> Never buy those mobile homes!
[12:56:26] <ButterNoodle> HubertFarnsworth: dont ask me.. older homes should depreciate
[12:57:05] <ButterNoodle> *may not be worth it, unless ur tired of paying rent
[12:57:22] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth mobile homes are fine if they're on owned land or in a resident-owned co-op
[12:57:27] <HubertFarnsworth> Is it in some sort of gated community?
[12:57:41] <emmeka> the way mobile home owners get screwed is when they're also leasing land. then you have the worst of all worlds.
[12:57:42] <S_T_A_N> It's a community. idk what the land situation is
[12:57:46] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: he's looking @ manufactured
[12:58:04] <ButterNoodle> is it like a trailer park?
[12:58:19] <S_T_A_N> Yeah kinda
[12:58:19] <HubertFarnsworth> What‚Äôs a manufactured home? Is it like made somewhere and assembled in the place?
[12:58:25] <DunceCotus> its a community of believers
[12:58:28] <emmeka> S_T_A_N figure that out first. The reason it's cheap is because it's probably on leased land.
[12:58:33] <emmeka> that's how these things usually go.
[12:58:40] <ButterNoodle> HubertFarnsworth: manufactured is a big category
[12:58:42] <ButterNoodle> there are many types
[12:58:44] <emmeka> S_T_A_N sometimes, these communities are resident-owned, though
[12:58:51] <ButterNoodle> ^
[12:58:52] <emmeka> like a cooperative or condo association
[12:59:00] <emmeka> that would be the first thing to verify.

[12:59:27] <HubertFarnsworth> But I heard those are rare cases for mobile homes emmeka
[12:59:35] <emmeka> nah they're pretty normal
[12:59:48] <emmeka> my grandma lives in one
[13:00:04] <HubertFarnsworth> Isn‚Äôt that hard?
[13:00:15] <emmeka> is what hard?

[13:00:35] <emmeka> no?
[13:01:01] <S_T_A_N> Land lease
[13:01:05] <S_T_A_N> god damn it
[13:01:10] <emmeka> yeah, no, stay away.
[13:01:16] <dfch> ^
[13:01:23] <HubertFarnsworth> Oof
[13:01:23] <emmeka> that's all the detriments of property ownership and none of the benefits.
[13:01:52] <S_T_A_N> If it looks too good to be true... OF COURSE IT IS
[13:02:14] <HubertFarnsworth> I still have around ten flats left in last project btw.
[13:02:27] <HubertFarnsworth> Could use money if someone buys them
[13:02:47] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth mobile homes are just the same as any other home for living in, they are just prefabricated to a highway-haulable size, with the ability to affix axles.
[13:02:57] <emmeka> there's nothing objectively wrong with them
[13:03:08] <emmeka> hell, good homes for a senior... they're all 1 story
[13:03:43] <HubertFarnsworth> I see.
[13:03:50] <emmeka> the issue is more that they depreciate (like vehicles) rather than appreciate (the way homes do in North America)
[13:04:00] *** Quits: totenkoph (~scythe@gateway/tor-sasl/totenkoph) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[13:05:08] <HubertFarnsworth> That should be normal but yeah, I see.
[13:05:58] <HubertFarnsworth> Is it true that almost every winter or so there are maintenance issues with houses in America?
[13:06:23] <HubertFarnsworth> It is totally different style of construction and issues here.
[13:06:58] <HubertFarnsworth> The only thing we have in common is marketing style. We have copied yours.
[13:07:16] <S_T_A_N> Oh yep there it is. $840/month land lease. Fuck. That.
[13:08:49] <HubertFarnsworth> Invest the money in range of stocks, consult an analyst or your bank guy and buy home later.
[13:08:58] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth I mean maintenance of houses is continuous, but I guess in North America we have a different attitude about houses than much of the world. It seems like in many places, when a house has reached a certain age, the norm is to tear it down and build anew.
[13:09:01] <HubertFarnsworth> When you turn 55
[13:09:12] <emmeka> here we tend to think old houses are best and fix them up forever
[13:10:08] <HubertFarnsworth> Yeah, that‚Äôs odd for me but I can kind of see why though.
[13:10:24] <ia_> same idea here emmeka, right now im in a house thats older than 100years 
[13:10:27] <HubertFarnsworth> Kind of like heritage and history thing I believe?
[13:11:04] <emmeka> well, there's that especially for really old stuff, but not even just historical things
[13:11:35] <emmeka> my house was built in the 1940s, it is nothing special and needed work when I bought it, but nobody would ever buy this house to demolish it
[13:12:06] <HubertFarnsworth> Another thing is emmeka, you peeps have lot of land. The population is quite high compared to available land so most old things just gets demolished.
[13:13:01] <HubertFarnsworth> It has been through the Great War? That‚Äôs epic man. Does it has a story?
[13:13:38] <emmeka> uhhh
[13:13:52] <emmeka> the great war was 1914-1918, and no
[13:14:01] <emmeka> there was no war here, afterall.
[13:14:12] <HubertFarnsworth> Oh, I thought it‚Äôs Second World War
[13:14:20] <JesseDesu> why do they call it the great war
[13:14:51] <emmeka> JesseDesu they also called it The War To End All Wars. I guess people of the time weren't very good at naming these things successfully.
[13:15:36] <JesseDesu> why dont they call it best war
[13:16:20] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth there were a lot of these kind of single family homes built here in the post-war years for returning vets, they are usually just called "wartime homes" or "strawberry box houses"
[13:16:30] <emmeka> they all have the exact same kind of design
[13:16:45] <HubertFarnsworth> How is the loan eligibility in America? It is gross salary multiplied by some number here.

[13:23:48] <HubertFarnsworth> I dropped the novel. Didn‚Äôt like some things.
[13:23:58] <PancakeMatsuri> it's one of the mediocre isekais, unfortunately
[13:24:11] <emmeka> I'm mainly just sticking with it because spider girl is the best isekai MC in years
[13:24:19] <PancakeMatsuri> battles were pretty bad
[13:24:35] <HubertFarnsworth> We don‚Äôt have isekais like log horizon these days.
[13:24:38] <emmeka> literally all other characters are lame, animation is meh, but spider is best girl
[13:25:24] <PancakeMatsuri> aren't MCs male usually?
[13:25:34] <emmeka> yes, that's one reason it's refreshing
[13:25:38] <PancakeMatsuri> I only remember the Saint
[13:25:43] <PancakeMatsuri> that is female
[13:25:50] <emmeka> female protagonist and it isn't just CGDCT
[13:26:09] <HubertFarnsworth> Mostly MCs are not just male, ordinary high school kids.
[13:26:40] <HubertFarnsworth> Fushigi Yuugi has good female mc

[15:24:02] <spoonm> by your logic, is a manga where the protagonist is raped empowering for rape victims?
[15:24:53] <amigojapan> spoonm: it may be of they beat the rapist to death
[15:25:21] <spoonm> the rape victim didn't do that, so they wouldn't be able to relate

[15:36:08] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: at least not mass change
[15:36:12] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, well it does mean they begin changing at an individual level. Sweden admittedly has issues with collectivism when it comes to bigger issues that go beyond the "household" individual self
[15:36:36] <amigojapan> I see
[15:37:03] <Cryowolf> what I meant was that Japanese people tend to be very collectivist even when it comes to individual things
[15:37:10] <Cryowolf> at least outwardly in public
[15:37:27] <amigojapan> Ok
[15:37:32] <Cryowolf> I forget the words but there's words that describe it

[15:46:22] <Cryowolf> but you can ask and then decline it there and go to another clinic
[15:46:33] <Cryowolf> it has some bad side effects like heart failure etc
[15:46:36] <dfch> *astrazeneca
[15:46:52] <Cryowolf> Sweden has stopped using it entirely
[15:46:57] <Cryowolf> a lot of countries have
[15:47:09] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: but I want to take it at the clinic I am used to
[15:47:10] <coeus> but the UK still uses it?
[15:47:25] <Cryowolf> I don't know
[15:48:07] <Cryowolf> A lot of countries stopped though, cause even the company now admits to the dangers
[15:49:20] <coeus> well that's a shame
[15:49:24] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I will call them tomorrow and ask what kind they are offering
[15:50:22] <Cryowolf> I mean most people won't get the side effects but, they're also concerned about the delayed ones
[15:50:34] <Cryowolf> pfizer is also more effective against mutations etc
[15:50:46] <amigojapan> I see
[15:51:19] <Cryowolf> it's a new technology using rna etc
[15:51:34] <amigojapan> Right
[15:52:02] <amigojapan> Weird that the first one to be out is the best one
[15:52:31] <coeus> as long as it's not mutigen of somekind
[15:52:37] <amigojapan> I would have thought that others wold have had time to fix their stuff
[15:53:52] <Cryowolf> rna based are easier to modify for mutations and you can simply get a small new shot every year to work against current and future predicted ones
[15:54:03] <Cryowolf> the pfizer one basically teaches your body to fight against it

[17:09:52] <DunceCotus> God can create ANYTHING, including his own negation
[17:10:01] <amigojapan> Can this create a rock so heavy he can't lift it?
[17:10:04] <coeus> anything
[17:10:15] <DunceCotus> amigojapan yes
[17:10:17] <coeus> nothing is impossible
[17:10:21] <lastonestanding> even girls with penises?
[17:10:30] <DunceCotus> lastonestanding especially
[17:10:34] <lastonestanding> woah
[17:10:40] <lastonestanding> I'm impressed
[17:11:02] <amigojapan> coeus: DunceCotus : if he creates such a rock he ceases to be omnipotent cause suddenly there is something he can't lift
[17:11:31] <parkeerwacht> hi
[17:11:33] <Sumida> God may have created some Universe, but not the Marvel Cinematic Universe
[17:11:35] <DunceCotus> amigojapan that's why God is dead
[17:11:41] <amigojapan> Hi parkeerwacht 
[17:11:51] <dfch> hi parkeerwacht
[17:12:10] <DunceCotus> he tried lifting a thing he created which he could not lift
[17:12:15] <DunceCotus> and it crushed him
[17:12:17] <amigojapan> Maybe DunceCotus . Maybe he committed seppuku
[17:12:19] <DunceCotus> poor guy
[17:12:42] <coeus> your thinking is that God is limited, that is false
[17:12:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan well that's one reading of Christianity
[17:13:08] <snake> DunceCotus, you decided to troll a different channel?
[17:13:12] <amigojapan> coeus: you just admitted he can limit himself
[17:13:23] <DunceCotus> snake I'm not trolling, spitballing maybe
[17:13:31] <snake> idk i didnt even read
[17:13:34] <snake> gotta poop
[17:13:36] <dfch> kami-sama wa seppuku o okashita
[17:13:37] <snake> bbl
[17:13:39] <coeus> no, I said anything is possible with God
[17:13:41] <DunceCotus> snake riiii-
[17:13:44] <dfch> amigojapan, do grammar/spell check pls ^
[17:13:50] <coeus> I never said it was impossible
[17:14:04] <amigojapan> dfch: zannen dane
[17:14:06] <DunceCotus> coeus but then God can't create a rock too heavy for him to lift
[17:14:10] <DunceCotus> so he can't do anything
[17:14:23] <DunceCotus> or rather can't do everything
[17:14:29] <DunceCotus> just some things
[17:14:40] <amigojapan> dfch: I think it is just "wo shita"
[17:15:08] <dfch> amigojapan, 3Q :3
[17:15:27] <amigojapan> U r welcome
[17:15:31] <DunceCotus> I do not think God is a coherent concept
[17:15:32] <coeus> there is no such thing as a rock that God can't lift
[17:15:49] <dfch> coeus, so he can't create one
[17:15:52] <DunceCotus> coeus so then he is limited
[17:16:29] <DunceCotus> however perhaps he is unlimited but can engender his own negation
[17:16:49] <DunceCotus> which may have already happened
[17:16:58] <amigojapan> dfch: to play devils advocate he could say "he just never willed to do so. But he could
[17:17:45] <DunceCotus> amigojapan but if he could do it, that still implies he is limited
[17:17:52] <DunceCotus> that is to say his own creation can best him
[17:17:59] <coeus> anything that can be done can be undone by God
[17:18:14] <dfch> amigojapan, all this god talk makes me want to rewatch saint‚òÜoniisan
[17:18:31] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: only if he wishes it to happen. But he is not stupid

[17:36:14] <Sadale> Now we've got Japanese nya, Chinese miao and Chinese meu. :3
[17:36:17] <HubertFarnsworth> Time to punch some trees.
[17:36:22] <davic> Sadale: I thought it was like 40 usd
[17:36:27] <dfch> amigojapan, not sure if rpi is beefy enough for it (assuming server can run on arm)
[17:36:30] <davic> 90 usd is a bit.... steep
[17:36:48] <Sadale> davic, lol don't worry about that. Don't fund what you can't afford. To be fair the space allows non-members like me to visit. xD
[17:37:11] <Sadale> davic, Not that I need the membership anyway. I've got most of the equipment I need at home. :3
[17:37:14] <amigojapan> Bco1981: I have played the RPI version of Minecraft without logging in
[17:37:32] <davic> Sadale: like I can afford it, but I'm kinda saving for my PH trip, I need to buy all shit new unless I want to ship my monitor and furniture
[17:37:43] <Bco1981> amigojapan: ah then it's the "pocket" edition, not the full java mincraft
[17:37:48] <Sadale> davic, same here. I can afford it as well. But I'd rather to put the money into my retirement fund xD
[17:38:06] <davic> Sadale: lets just force dfch into sponsoring you
[17:38:19] <amigojapan> Ah ok Bco1981 
[17:38:30] <davic> Sadale: apparently gofundme is a thing
[17:38:33] <Sadale> davic, In fact my imouto's tuition fee is like $450 per month. So spending $90 per month isn't really a problem to me. The true reason that I'm not spending it is that, frankly, it isn't worth it :P
[17:38:42] <davic> "Fund Sadale's Retirement Fund"
[17:38:52] <Sadale> plus I'm frugal af for my retirement fund xD
[17:38:57] <Bco1981> snake: on 1.16 ?
[17:39:28] <Sadale> davic, do provide intel to me on life in PH as a foreigner tho. That's because, again, I'm interested in retiring there :3
[17:39:47] <Sadale> Either PH or somewhere in south america. They have low living cost.
[17:39:49] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: we are frugal even if there is no retirement fund.
[17:39:55] <Sadale> And they're easy to move to.
[17:40:09] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, interesting. What do you guys save the money for?
[17:40:11] <snake> Bco1981, yeah 1.16.1
[17:40:12] <davic> Sadale: I will, but again borders are closed but from what I read they might open up to vaccinated autistic kids soon
[17:40:18] <Sadale> oh no rush
[17:40:29] <dfch> Sadale, if it's not uruguay then g'luck
[17:40:32] <dfch> hee hee
[17:40:38] <Sadale> davic, anyway, let's hope that the border would get reopened :3
[17:40:41] <dfch> uruguay is k tho
[17:40:43] <Bco1981> snake: .1 ? but there is already .5 ?
[17:40:44] <Sadale> dfch, what's so good about uruguay?
[17:40:52] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: mostly for weddings, future, education and gold.
[17:40:52] <amigojapan> Sadale: my family used to save it "just in case of an emergency
[17:40:59] <Sadale> dfch, put it another way, what's so bad about other latin ameican countries?
[17:41:06] <Sadale> aww
[17:41:09] <HubertFarnsworth> The people are nuts about gold here Sadale
[17:41:11] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, it keeps the gold price up
[17:41:17] <Sadale> oh. decoration gold.
[17:41:18] <snake> Bco1981, my friend is not good at running the server
[17:41:22] <Sadale> not gold for value
[17:41:23] <snake> but i dont feel like doing it for him
[17:41:28] <Sadale> luxury*
[17:41:32] <HubertFarnsworth> And also the budget deficit Sadale
[17:42:11] <dfch> Sadale, low crime rate, legalized weed, plenty of free wifi city-wide (in montevideo) and ez access to ABCs of Caribbean (not atm because 'rona)
[17:42:33] <Sadale> I see. Currently my plan is to invest most of my savings, while keeping a little bit in case of emergency
[17:42:39] <Sadale> dfch, what's ABC?
[17:42:45] <dfch> Sadale, also cheap medical (not the best, nor worst) 
[17:42:53] <HubertFarnsworth> Nope, there is nothing much in buying gold here btw. They just buy the jewellery and put them in lockers. Never sell them, maybe use them for loans.
[17:42:56] <dfch> Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao
[17:43:23] <Sadale> dfch, I'd imagine uruguay may not be that easy to move to tho. And the living cost often increase with quality of life.
[17:43:23] <davic> dfch: are you going to live with me still?
[17:43:27] <Sadale> I'm not quite after weed tho
[17:43:30] <davic> Or should I look into another roommate

[17:44:45] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: move to PH and live with davic
[17:44:51] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, that works
[17:44:57] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, or Miyu-saki :P
[17:45:10] <HubertFarnsworth> By the time you retire davic would have bought good house, car and what not
[17:45:10] <dfch> davic, tbh if am to move to PH, it would be Manila
[17:45:23] <davic> dfch: we are looking near manila so
[17:45:28] <HubertFarnsworth> He will introduce you to PH women too
[17:45:29] <davic> HubertFarnsworth: dont think waifu would like that

[17:48:44] <davic> I haven't even met dfch yet so
[17:48:48] <Sadale> hmm. It makes me wonder if Miyu-saki has a wife.
[17:48:48] <HubertFarnsworth> It‚Äôs funny how opposite our goals are Sadale. I want to have European citizen to live and work there while you want to come this side.
[17:48:52] <davic> Maybe he'll steal my kidneys
[17:48:53] <davic> Who knows
[17:49:16] <davic> Sadale: prob, unless he is retired or have lived in PH less than 3 years
[17:49:25] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, lol I want to conserve money and live an internet life while you wanna get European citizenship because of the perks there xD
[17:49:43] <HubertFarnsworth> Yeah
[17:49:57] <Sadale> davic, come to think of it dfch might have gotten arrested for stealing someone's kidney. :P
[17:50:02] <HubertFarnsworth> Europe is sophisticated Sadale
[17:50:15] <davic> Sadale: not suprised
[17:50:23] <dfch> Sadale, I condone kidney stealing
[17:50:37] <dfch> (unless done by state)
[17:50:39] <Sadale> davic, in long run tho I'm a bit worried about PH. Climate change and natural disasters. I don't think PH would have the resources to deal with it.
[17:50:39] <HubertFarnsworth> It‚Äôs not like our shitty Asian countries full of nothing but blocks of concrete
[17:50:54] <davic> Sadale: the worst shit about working with files sent by companies is that this fucking companies send a zip file
[17:51:08] <HubertFarnsworth> davic: you need kidney blocker 2000
[17:51:12] <davic> And most companies like Disney sends like max 2-3 files a month
[17:51:21] <davic> This company sends like 900 per month per product
[17:51:28] <davic> Disney has like 10 pages
[17:51:32] <Sadale> davic, Meanwhile in Hong Kong I do believe the government here should have the money to deal with this kind of thing. Even if it couldn't, mainland China would probably be helping as it's one of the important cities of China.
[17:51:33] <davic> This one has 1098
[17:52:02] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: the best are Scandinavian nations like Norway. Norway is best!

[17:54:10] <amigojapan> Sadale: Japan is also full of temples and shrines
[17:54:25] <Sadale> amigojapan, cool! :3
[17:54:37] <dfch> Sadale, cheaper than Êñ∞Áïå
[17:54:53] <davic> dfch: I'm happy to support the Chinese government and their ownership of HK, TW, SG, PH, JP, Macau,  Russia, Europe, USA, LA
[17:55:03] <Sadale> dfch, Will look into that later. First thing first, I need the retirement money. :-(

[18:45:00] <dfch> dubs are wrong
[18:45:00] <emmeka> dfch on time for what?
[18:45:04] <dfch> :D
[18:45:07] <Sadale> To me the difficulty of listening English goes like this: easiest: anime/informational vid < movie/tv shows/voice chat < most difficult: weird voice (e.g. robotic voice, screaming, etc)/bad quality audio (e.g. intercom)
[18:45:40] <dfch> emmeka english dubs in anime is blasphemy :p
[18:45:48] <emmeka> dfch obviously listening to the original Japanese audio is preferable insofar as you speak Japanese. If you don't, it's a matter of which form of translation you prefer. And all translation is a lossy process.
[18:46:02] <Sadale> dfch, so what's the Cantonese dub ones then? I grew up with that xD
[18:46:21] <emmeka> dubs are a different kind of translation than subs, is all
[18:46:39] <Sadale> If you listen enough tho you'd be able to understand a few phrases.
[18:46:40] <Bco1981> And all translation is a lossy process. exactly, you won't get the true intended story/meaning.
[18:46:55] <amigojapan> emmeka: sadale watches English dubbed to practice listening. I think it is fine
[18:46:59] <dfch> emmeka, also on more serious note, about the hospital, is everything ok?

[18:49:11] <emmeka> I think one thing that people don't seem to acknowledge when they say "lots of dubs are shit" is that lots of subs are also totally shit. Remember how much garbage we had to sift through in the fansub age? Unnecessary translator notes, weird fonts, random insistence on continuing to use Japanese words untranslated instead of an English word...
[18:49:32] <Sadale> In fact I find reading English easier than listening.
[18:49:39] <emmeka> and don't forget the official subs back then either, which came in one variety: piss yellow borderboxed picture-in-picture text

[18:53:00] <dfch> emmeka, location?

[19:32:23] <Sadale> 3500 lines of code and counting. The IoT clock project.
[19:32:55] <Sadale> And it's Arduino code. It means that the 3500 lines doesn't include lower level library
[19:33:03] <Sadale> What have I done? This clock's complex as fuck xD
[19:33:40] <Nanobot> Thanks, Hololive. Now I have like 18 hours of content I need to watch before some tournament begins 2 hours from now.
[19:33:42] <CyberTailor> Sadale: why not STM32?
[19:33:59] <CyberTailor> coding ARM is more pleasant than Arduino
[19:34:01] <Sadale> CyberTailor, ESP8266's cheaper. And STM32 doesn't have reliable supply anymore thanks to the COVID :-(
[19:34:23] <Sadale> Actually I like the Arduino library more. I do use STM's library for something more serious tho.
[19:34:46] <CyberTailor> > STM's library
[19:34:48] <CyberTailor> which one?
[19:34:50] <Sadale> It depends on the scale. For smaller scale projects I'd go for Arduino.
[19:34:52] <Sadale> CyberTailor, HAL or LL
[19:34:56] <Sadale> I've used both
[19:35:19] <Sadale> CyberTailor, so you coded in STM as well? :O
[19:35:29] <Sadale> s/in/for/
[19:35:50] <CyberTailor> Sadale: yes, using CMSIS
[19:35:52] <Sadale> As for this project tho maybe I shouldn't have go for Arduino because I didn't anticipate that it'd get so large in scale. 3500 LoC. :(
[19:36:15] <CyberTailor> good luck debugging
[19:36:17] <Sadale> CyberTailor, ah. That's pretty low level. So you just manipulate the STM32 registers using your own code without using LL or HAL?
[19:36:25] <Jigsy> Nagatoro is finally over. :<
[19:36:51] <Sadale> CyberTailor, oh it's actually kind of tolerable. Someone had managed to get gdb works for ESP8266 with Arduino library. And I got the same done by following the instruction I found online.
[19:36:54] <CyberTailor> Sadale: documentation is great
[19:37:21] <Sadale> CyberTailor, Wouldn't that be a bit time-consuming to figure out the lower level stuffs tho?
[19:37:52] <CyberTailor> it's more exciting and rewarding
[19:38:02] <Sadale> agreed. It's rewarding. :3
[19:38:37] <Sadale> CyberTailor, I coudln't believe we've got so much in common. We're both in ##anime, we both speak toki pona, and we both programmed for microcontroller, and unlike those Arduino kids we both programmed in lower level.

[23:02:52] <TsundereNoises> hey Bco1981
[23:03:02] <TsundereNoises> sorry if too many links
[23:03:03] <ButterNoodle> hey
[23:03:21] <Bco1981> TsundereNoises: that's okay, it's not like 20 links at once :D
[23:04:04] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: so I don't know if it got lost in the conversation around it, but with the Kanata clip, I can't help thinking it sounds like the episode right before the end of a cute 12 episode anime
[23:04:15] <Bco1981> hey ButterNoodle :)
[23:04:28] <TsundereNoises> they should really just make hololive an anime franchise with  full 20 min episodes instead of just hologra
[23:04:47] <Bco1981> TsundereNoises: yeah really does feel like a #11 of a 12 episode series.
[23:05:06] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: I feel like Kanata's production of the gen 4 music video should be done to a montage with the song playing in the background

[23:09:22] <ImoutoBot> reak.
[23:09:30] <TsundereNoises> ever step away from a website because it's too stupid, then come back much later and realize it's somehow gotten 10x worse?

[23:15:28] <TsundereNoises> but yeah I guess tech-wise things like youtube keep getting progressively dumber too
[23:15:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Youtube has kept making itself worse technology-wise in the span of a decade.
[23:16:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They've fixed less things than Peertube has implemented in fewer years.
[23:16:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> With a team dozens of times larger.
[23:16:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's a trainwreck of a project.

[23:18:37] <mixfix41> hmm internet is pretty busy so it will have people that just move their fingers and put words down
[23:19:12] <mixfix41> i been wanting to give gopher a try but im not too sure i have doubts
[23:21:03] <mixfix41> but i get it there were some shitpost accounts that never annoy the crap out of me so yea
[23:23:13] <TsundereNoises> for me it was more that I was trying to figure out an answer to a japanese question, and several of the sites that used to be sometimes useful have just gotten much MUCH more stupid
[23:23:16] <TsundereNoises> userbase-wise
[23:23:28] *** Quits: shinythings (~darkwitch@user/darkwitch) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:25:42] <mixfix41> yea it would help if those had more direct communication i imagine then just filler
[23:25:58] <TsundereNoises> a bad answer is so much worse than no answer

[23:26:43] <mixfix41> normal people have the tact filter that opposite of nerd use tact filter
[23:26:49] <TsundereNoises> this ISN'T new, but the thing that bugs me most is japanese native speakers taking the time to help people trying to learn japanese (in theory) and then just copy-pasting google results
[23:26:56] <TsundereNoises> no one would ask that if google was sufficient!
[23:28:43] <Bco1981> TsundereNoises: that website thing... yeah, the equivalent of newegg in denmark... has gotten worse and worse, and keep getting worse every time they "update".
[23:29:01] <TsundereNoises> I sometimes feel that way about MAL too
[23:30:38] <TsundereNoises> but yeah, languages are tough, there's all kinds of weird questions where you just want a native to tell you how something is generally used
[23:30:50] <TsundereNoises> and copying from an online dictionary is completely fucking useless
[23:31:04] <TsundereNoises> I enjoy answering those kind of questions for english
[23:36:35] <Poeticode> i made the mistake of eating food and now i'm full :(
[23:36:45] <ButterNoodle> just poop it out
[23:36:56] <Poeticode> oooh good idea

[23:38:57] <Poeticode> hmm i bet it'd feel like chewing 5-gum
[23:39:37] <TsundereNoises> you can put drugs up your ass, does that count as "charging?"
[23:39:45] <TsundereNoises> I'd argue it does
[23:40:08] <Poeticode> nothing beats a good buttchug
