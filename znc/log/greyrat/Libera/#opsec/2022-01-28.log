[03:43:44] <ilikeyou> someone today told me about a recent podcast explaining android telemetry in relation to apple. i'm trying to look for it, but i find it hard to believe android is less private that apple 
[03:44:28] <Hydragyrum> android is literally google + whatever the oem and carrier decide to put on
[03:45:21] <Hydragyrum> google sells data to advertisers...
[03:46:21] <ilikeyou> android phones, i should specify. the hardware is way more flexible. the stock software is spooky, for sure.
[03:54:09] <Joanna> What about the degoogled phones ?
[03:55:11] <ilikeyou> yea thats what i mentioned to my friend, but he wasn't really aware. Not a big tech guy. Prob and interesting talk, nonetheless. I'll see if i can find a link 
[03:55:50] <Hydragyrum> I'm still waiting for linux phone to work well
[03:55:53] <Joanna> According to some people the entire internet and everything that connects to it are spyware
[03:56:17] <Joanna> Internet was created by DARPA right ?
[03:57:01] <Hydragyrum> well that's somewhat of an exaggeration but
[03:57:17] <Hydragyrum> a large portion of stuff on the internet is spyware to one degree or another
[04:01:26] <Joanna> There is a lot of talk about devices spying but there is something much more insidious than that.. the brains of the majority of the population have been literally hijacked everywhere I go I see zombies staring at phones and judging by the signs I see people have had some bad accidents such as falling off train platforms. Moving walkways have to have auditory warnings when reaching the end etc I’ve also heard stories of ground level 
[04:01:26] <Joanna> strobe lights the alert zombies glued to their toys.
[04:03:05] <Joanna> People can’t strike up conversations in public anymore when waiting or traveling because they have been reduced remote controlled fleshbots staring at toys.
[04:04:17] <Joanna> For doctor who fans .. the population is being transformed into cyber men.

[19:51:35] <jan6> yeah
[19:55:22] <jan6> most mainstream stuff doesn't have that much masked and hidden spyware, it's mostly gonna be used by people who have no idea about the stuff anyway, and people who do know about it, are probably not gonna bother manually removing everything (except for a couple specialized projects, sure, but very few people are gonna use those, overall, anyway)
