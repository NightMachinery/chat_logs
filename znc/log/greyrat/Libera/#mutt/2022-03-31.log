[05:41:59] <kevin8t8> madduck: the SMTPUTF8 RFC does have some statements about international headers "at any level within its MIME structure"
[05:42:54] <kevin8t8> madduck: seems kinda strange to me that SMTPUTF8 would care about headers in attachments, but perhaps that's what is causing the problem.
[05:44:19] <kevin8t8> madduck: however, it _looks_ like it also depends on 8BITMIME being set by the client.  so I would double check you don't have $use_8bitmime in mutt.  perhaps turning that off will fix this problem.

[15:56:24] <madduck> So RFC 6531 says that international characters must not appear in mail headers *anywhere within the MIME structure*, i.e. including in message/rfc822 subparts. Microsoft Outlook, of course, doesn't give a shit, and doesn't encode anything, nor does it request SMTPUTF8 when submitting mail. To me, this raises the question of whether mutt should do the proper encoding on messages it attaches to a MIME 
[15:56:30] <madduck> structure. What do you think?

[18:54:15] <Liblx> rkta: Thanks.
[18:55:09] <Liblx> Are there good improvements from 1.13 to 2.2? The look and the basics are the same, right?
[18:58:27] <rkta> Liblx: This is highly subjectiv, but imho yes. The basics are the same, though.
[18:59:43] <rkta> Liblx: Are you missing something? If not, why bother maintaining a self-compiled version.

[21:27:23] <rwp> Liblx, That means you need to install build dependencies of mutt before compiling.  And it is missing the curses library.  Usually called "libncurses6".
[21:27:49] <rwp> Liblx, Which OS are you running?  Every OS is different.  If we know then we might suggest what you need to install.
[21:28:34] <rwp> Liblx, If it is Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Devuan, or similar then "apt-get build-dep mutt" would install all of the build dependencies of the OS packaging of mutt.
[21:28:44] <rwp> And that would be good enough for your self-compiled version too.
[21:43:33] <Liblx> rwp: Thanks a lot and sorry for the late replay. It's Ubuntu base here. So I'll try 'sudo apt-get build-dep mutt'. Thanks.
