[03:14:25] <lechner_> especially when data structures change. haskell is unbeatable in early error detection. it does not even compile

[03:16:16] <lechner_> i probably should. i started out with stack but found cabal more agreeable. the tracker is also fifteen years old
[03:17:09] <janus> now that cabal gets remote freeze files you can use stackage with cabal-install
[03:17:24] <janus> you can already do that, i think, it's just not as ergonomic

[03:19:34] <sm> stackage (and all the haskellers fixing issues with each snapshot) already prefilter hackage to manageable consistent sets of package versions (much like Debian started doing long ago), it seems sensible to take advantage of that work
[03:20:25] <sm> note stack /= stackage
[03:20:57] <lechner_> i think we do    https://salsa.debian.org/haskell-team/package-plan/-/commit/71273db3af2813877ae0de2d9bea4fb34cc1bc5e
[03:20:58] <monochrom> IMO not packaging a decade-old GHC version is the most important factor for getting Haskell people to fall in love with debian again.

[06:33:54] <Guest662> thanks dsal and int-e, I think the second using fromListWith is something near what I thought was possible.
[06:34:34] <Guest662> btw, I don't have to keep it as a list, I just didn't know a better way and am not sure if it's easily possible to do this without toList first.

[06:37:17] <Guest662> Yeah, it simplifies things. I like knowing when those things are possible though to have a finer handle on determining "is it worth it"

[06:43:52] <int-e> For this kind of thing, because of list fusion, [a] often behaves more like an iterator generating elements of type a than an actual list.

[06:45:38] <int-e> (and even when fusion isn't taking place, lazy evaluation (producing the list as elements are demanded) and garbage collection (freeing up the used part of the list) still achieve something reasonable, but of course this is less efficient than not allocating the list at all)

[19:28:58] <geekosaur> yoyu should generally include the error message as well

[19:31:19] <lambdabot> (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool

[20:14:30] <worldhelloworld> interesting, I hadn't much clue people use haskell for backend - wonder how it compares to other languages/performance ........ will google ghcjs now :D
[20:14:39] <geekosaur> texasmynsted, depending on how involved your orders are you might not need more than a simple ledger system. if you have multipleline items or want things like a pricing system fo rorder entry, you would want an actual order entry and invoicing system

[20:21:54] <texasmynsted> that sounds like a serious system
[20:21:55] <worldhelloworld> just curious, for something like a simple invoicing system - do you use custom data types? Or built in ones with some kind of a database? trying to understand the approach

[20:23:08] <texasmynsted> For me, I am going for a simple as possible, so storage is using types defined by sqlite/duckdb but in Haskell I would expect custom.
[20:23:16] <geekosaur> \it's one reason numeric types are often defined in terms of their display characteristics, because it helps with designing forms and reports

[20:23:52] <geekosaur> ugh
[20:23:58] <geekosaur> that's ginna be a nightmare
[20:24:05] <geekosaur> PDF is a *lousy* input format
[20:24:12] <texasmynsted> which? megaparsec?
[20:24:45] <geekosaur> the problem with PDF is what you see rendered looks like it's discrete, but the actual contents of the PDF are tiny little move-print-move-print operations
[20:24:49] <texasmynsted> I could "try" to dictate that all vendors send me a csv in a fixed format with the pdf. 
[20:25:23] <worldhelloworld> yea I would have expected custom datatypes too, maybe I am just excited learning about it for now, but good to know to go with built-in types .... i guess it would help with compatibility too if a language/tooling change occurs in the lifecycle of the product
[20:25:27] <texasmynsted> The few fields I _need_

[20:28:21] <texasmynsted> But most vendors send new invoices that look much the same as invoices they sent the month prior. If I can create a parser for each vendor is should work most of the time for them

[20:28:50] <texasmynsted> I would just have a bunch of custom parsers
[20:29:00] <geekosaur> there are actually standards for digital transmission of orders and invoices
[20:29:01] <worldhelloworld> hmm ok
[20:29:19] <geekosaur> widely used by large companies
[20:29:22] <texasmynsted> I think most vendors would consider CSV because it would be so easy for them to create.
[20:29:48] <texasmynsted> The problem is that many of them have invoices _automaticaly_ generated by their accounting system.
[20:30:06] <texasmynsted> Those produce a web page and or a pdf.

[20:56:21] <texasmynsted> I really like this but it does not look like it addresses the problem I am trying to solve]'
[20:57:11] <texasmynsted> The problem I am trying to solve is easily insert data into sqlite or other database. 
[20:57:13] <sm> hledger's native format is a plain text one, but think of that as a common exchange/reporting format, plain text accounting often involves importing/exporting/converting between whatever formats you have
[20:57:36] <sm> you mentioned ingesting pdf invoices, I guess that's a separate problem
[20:57:52] <dsal> That sounds like a large collection of problems. heh
[20:57:59] <dsal> "pdf" means "paper" to me.
[20:58:00] <texasmynsted> yes it has import/export and export to CSV as a part of its basic function
[20:58:13] <geekosaur> yeh, I described the problems with pdf earlier
[20:58:39] <sm> how complex is the data you want to enter texasmynsted ? could you express it as csv ? that's the most compact format for data entry
[20:58:50] <texasmynsted> Super easy
[20:58:56] <texasmynsted> There are like 5 fields
[20:59:24] <texasmynsted> They are just found in different places in the pdfs.
[20:59:53] <sm> so you'd read the pdfs and manually transcribe these values
[21:00:31] <texasmynsted> I could convert the pdfs to text. Tried this. It works fairly well, and I could then create parsers for each vendor based on the pdf/text
[21:00:49] <texasmynsted> I would still need a simple way to enter the data when the pdf import fails.

[21:01:49] <sm> hledger add is a data entry TUI, you could explore that too
[21:03:26] <texasmynsted> yes. I will keep exploring hledger. What would you use for a haskell TUI form? (Looking at brick)
[21:04:29] <sm> brick if you need a full screen app (overkill unless you plan to grow it)
[21:04:55] <texasmynsted> I would rather something simpler.
[21:05:16] <sm> wizards is what hledger add uses for composable interactive console prompts
[21:05:42] <sm> simple getLine (?) is enough for reading input
[21:06:20] <sm> but for the case you described it doesn't need to be interactive at all, so a command with args could work ?
[21:07:30] <texasmynsted> I suppose so.

[22:38:09] <polyphem>  hi, if i would write an application using libraries, how are dependencies and transitive dependencies handled , licensewise ? could cabal for example gather all involved licences ?

[23:16:53] <geekosaur> there is IHaskell which is a Haskell plugin for Jupyter
[23:16:54] <WhateverRabbit> you can use jupyter with haskell
