[00:40:17] <Yehowshua> Hi lisp123
[00:40:22] <lisp123> Hi Yehowshua
[00:40:41] <lisp123> I will explain some items step by step, hopefully it will help
[00:40:51] <Yehowshua> Appreciated
[00:41:15] <lisp123> 1) Common Lisp stores variables & functions within objects called "symbols", you are probably aware of these
[00:41:41] <lisp123> The way CL works is, when it encounters a symbol, it does a lookup to find out what that symbol means (i.e. what it points to)
[00:41:58] <Yehowshua> ok
[00:42:07] <lisp123> This "lookup table" is called the package
[00:42:46] <lisp123> CL will look up symbols in what is the _current_ package
[00:43:15] <lisp123> If you have your REPL open, you can type *PACKAGE* to see what is currently the _current_ package
[00:43:33] <lisp123> The next question is why do we have packages?
[00:43:58] <lisp123> The main issue it is solving is if there are two functions or variables that have the same name (i.e. a nameclash)
[00:44:41] <Yehowshua> ah
[00:44:46] <lisp123> So Programmer A writes a function "web-server" and Programmer B writes a function (a different one, with the same name) also as "web-server"
[00:44:55] <lisp123> Then you are stuck. This is where packages come in
[00:45:19] <lisp123> Programmer A can use his own package (i.e. his symbol lookup table) and Programmer B can use his own package
[00:45:39] <lisp123> And you can avoid nameclashes by referring to _both_ the package name & the symbol name when using them
[00:46:06] <Yehowshua> makes sense so far
[00:46:07] <lisp123> So that is the gist of packages - you create them to store the symbols (names for functions & variables) that you will use in your work
[00:46:19] <lisp123> And to avoid them clashing with other people's symbols
[00:46:40] <lisp123> On the other hand, ASDF stands for Another System Definition Facility
[00:47:02] <lisp123> What that means is a file that gives instructions on how to build a particular lisp project
[00:47:26] <lisp123> By which I mean, the order in which to load any dependencies, so that all dependencies that are required by a file, are loaded before they are used
[00:47:45] <Yehowshua> ah
[00:47:47] <lisp123> So packages = lookup table for symbols & ASDF = build order for your project
[00:48:00] <lisp123> Two separate things, but with similar names and used usually together
[00:48:09] <Yehowshua> I see
[00:48:16] <lisp123> If you had a file, main.lisp, and had a series of LOAD commands
[00:48:49] <lisp123> That's basically the same thing as using a .ASD file, except it will be interpreted not compiled (I believe there is a COMPILE-FILE equivalent that does the latter)
[00:49:25] <lisp123> So when to move from just "loading" files to .ASD? I would say once you are more comfortable with Lisp and work with more dependencies, but there's no hard and fast rule
[00:49:32] <Yehowshua> it seems sbcl compiles by default almost always
[00:49:51] <lisp123> I think its important to understand packages early on though. You will definitely start to get name clashes fast ;)
[00:50:10] <Yehowshua> for sure
[00:50:13] <lisp123> Yes I think that's true
[00:50:45] <lisp123> Here's a guide on packages that you can use to get started: https://ashok-khanna.medium.com/an-introduction-to-lisp-packages-7a9ee352006e
[00:52:01] <lisp123> Just to confirm, do you sort of get the high level meanings behind packages and ASDF? I didn't want to go into detail, but hopefully this has been helpful

[01:01:11] <Yehowshua> Yes - I get ASDF
[01:01:16] <Yehowshua> I built makefiles in a previous life
[01:01:24] <Yehowshua> So dependencies are no stranger to me
[01:01:46] <lotuseater> brrrr makefiles
[01:02:55] <Yehowshua> I've been around the block - I tried porting the linux kernel to a custom CPU not too long ago
[01:04:45] <lotuseater> sounds challenging
[01:05:51] <Yehowshua> yeah - I didn't finish - I'll loop back around to it once I finish the CPU simulator
[01:06:43] <lotuseater> writing simulators in CL can be fun (and efficient)
[01:08:02] <Yehowshua> yeah - I'll eventually be writing an RTL simulator once I finish writing the RTLIL lexer parser in CL

[01:08:28] <lotuseater> okay I'll look what RTL is :)
