[02:27:57] <Jacobis9000> I made a craps game in lisp!
[02:28:16] <Jacobis9000> With help from the book, and in fact, the rules of craps which I did not know from the book, what a great book this is!
[02:49:13] <Jacobis9000> Where is that nice guy who was here before, I forget his name, he was keen to answer questions on Lisp, and talk about Lisp?
[02:59:48] <White_Flame> idunno, there's lots of answerers around
[03:01:08] <Jacobis9000> I wonder what his name was, he was a nice guy
[03:03:18] <Jacobis9000> I am watching a lecture on functional design patterns in a language I can't read and am not that interested in learning.
[03:03:30] <Jacobis9000> Might go back to the Scheme lectures
[03:10:46] <gilberth> Oh dear, there is that "functional" again, the other f-word.
[03:12:01] <Jacobis9000> oh here's an idea, I could make a Lisp program to compute fibonacci numbers
[03:13:19] <Jacobis9000> tomorrow
[03:15:32] <gilberth> shka: Isn't CSV supposed to be a line oriented file format? So, why isn't READ-LINE used? And, yes, CL does not make it particular easy to write fast I/O as you essentially would need your own buffering. In contrast to C's <stdio.h> where all FILE's share the same buffer layout and getc(3) could be inlined calling out to an underflow discipline if needed.
[03:15:46] <Jacobis9000> You know what functional means to me? You do everything through functions, and have reasonable expectation of the same return value when the same function is invoked with given parameters, whilst accepting there might be need for side-effects. I had more to say... Functions have to be fundamental. Nesting natural, recursion straightforward.
[03:16:18] <moon-child> Jacobis9000: you have a reasonable expectation that READ-LINE will have the same return value every time?
[03:16:57] <Jacobis9000> something like that
[03:16:59] * gilberth grins.
[03:18:51] <Jacobis9000> I am enjoying these scheme lectures. Have you seen them? The MIT ones, with the chap who had no hair, and then, suddenly had hair.
[03:20:45] <Jacobis9000> Obviously saved up for a hair transplant or something, looked good anyway, maybe it's a toupee.
[03:21:43] <Jacobis9000> He prefers iteration to recursion
[03:22:18] <Jacobis9000> Although it seems to be largely based on safety in event of system crash and data loss
[03:23:05] <gilberth> However, with CL I/O the trouble is: I can't return more than one single character of lookahead, so that when I use my own buffer to read something, this defeats modularity, as my buffer is not your buffer. This would work, if I could have sth like WITH-STREAM-BUFFER, where I would get hold of a buffer, a read pointer, a fill pointer and an underflow discipline as well as a protocol to spill the pointers, that is write them back to the s
[03:23:53] <Jacobis9000> oh and I quite like emacs now I've done the tutorial and made notes
[03:24:35] <mfiano> gilberth: You need to properly configure your IRC client I think. It dropped the last part of your message, as the protocol only allows 512 characters, which includes your nick and hostmask and the command iirc.
[03:24:36] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: Don't be fooled to believe we use recursion for iteration for no good reason. Lisp is not used that way. And btw TCO is guaranteed with CL at all.
[03:25:01] <Jacobis9000> TCO?
[03:25:27] <gilberth> mfinao: Sorry. I would need to fix my IRC client as this is my own implementation. *blush*
[03:25:55] <mfiano> gilberth: https://i.lisp.cl/HNvVt2.png
[03:26:00] <Jacobis9000> cool you've made yourself an IRC client?
[03:26:05] <Jacobis9000> What a fun project idea!
[03:26:31] <Catie> Jacobis9000: TCO is tail call optimization
[03:27:10] <gilberth> [...] back to the stream object. The idea is that you take momentary ownership of the buffer and what would have been READ-CHAR boils down to AREF.
[03:27:47] <pl> TCO is guaranteed only in Scheme, iirc
[03:28:06] * gilberth nods.
[03:28:12] <mfiano> gilberth: Don't feel bad, most IRC clients get this wrong, and most of the ones that get it right are only by accident, as they hard-code (or make configurable like ERC) an option for maximum message length, but ignore the fact that the command and hidden parts are considered part of the IRC protocol messsage.
[03:29:17] <gilberth> mfiano: Actually this is an item on my TODO already. ;) I am just not sure how to handle that? Split messages automatically? I am not sure whether I like that.
[03:29:42] <mfiano> gilberth: let me look up in the RFC again...
[03:30:14] <gilberth> Perhaps a little display of characters left at the message input field. Like old phones did for SMS messages?
[03:30:20] <mfiano> IRC messages are always lines of characters terminated with a CR-LF
[03:30:22] <mfiano>    (Carriage Return - Line Feed) pair, and these messages shall not
[03:30:24] <mfiano>    exceed 512 characters in length, counting all characters including
[03:30:26] <mfiano>    the trailing CR-LF. Thus, there are 510 characters maximum allowed
[03:30:28] <mfiano>    for the command and its parameters.
[03:30:35] <gilberth> mfiano: The overall message size is limited.
[03:30:47] <mfiano> so 510 minus command minus parameters (parameters including user text sent)
[03:31:02] <gilberth> That is: The longer the channel name, the less I could have actual payload.
[03:31:13] <mfiano> then split on closest whitespace to that limit or sth
[03:31:19] <mfiano> sending multiple messages
[03:31:32] <mfiano> and perhaps warning if multiple is more thaqn N as to not flood accidentally
[03:31:38] <mfiano> than*
[03:31:58] <gilberth> Yes, but it would need to happen at a layer, which cannot know the limit.
[03:32:17] <mfiano> That sounds like an architectural problem, not of an implementation.
[03:34:11] <gilberth> The transport layer knows the limit of the overall IRC message, but cannot reasonably assume whether splitting is ok and how to do that. CTCP messages e.g. have extra "parenthesis" around them. Colour codes have state, and commands cannot be split at all.
[03:35:00] <mfiano> AFAIK, color is an extension not part of the original specification.
[03:35:15] <gilberth> The sanest would be a condition signaled by the transport layer saying "Please split, if you can".
[03:35:50] <gilberth> mfinao: And? It's there and in wide use. And italic and bold are kind of required.
[03:35:59] <gilberth> As is CTCP.
[03:36:19] <mfiano> Anything would be better than the full message showing up for you, but not for others. That has led to some confusing situations before :)
[03:36:52] <mfiano> Even if that something is read what the server gets afterwards and fill in the missing data with another message
[03:36:58] <gilberth> Sure, all I say is that the transport layer cannot split messages, and shouldn't.
[03:38:17] <gilberth> It should signal a condition instead. But then I still use CL-IRC for that part and it's not too great.
[03:38:40] <gilberth> Besides it's an octet limit, not a character limit.
[03:39:38] <mfiano> IIRC, the RFC mandates its own subset of ASCII, and nothing to do with octets.
[03:39:48] <mfiano> Unless I misunderstand whaty you mean.
[03:41:04] <Jacobis9000> so I read up on TCO, CL doesn't have it?
[03:41:23] <Catie> Jacobis9000: Common Lisp doesn't _guarantee_ it
[03:41:24] <gilberth> It is as all protocols a binary protocol. And it's not ASCII, nicknames are in national 7-bit ASCII variants, which is why uppercase "[" is "{" with nicknames, as nicknames are case-insenstive.
[03:41:26] <mfiano> CL doesn't mandate it. An implementation can
[03:41:53] <Catie> In practice, most implementations will have TCO, but you can't necessarily count on it across all implementations
[03:42:03] <mfiano> CL is a very flexible language standard, but not an implementation of a language. These are often the same thing with most other languages.
[03:42:48] <gilberth> Besides it's far from trivial to specify what would be a tail-position with CL.
[03:43:12] <Catie> Scheme does mandate TCO, which is why it tends to get brought up in conversations about Lisp
[03:43:58] <gilberth> Even sth. like (block nil ... (foo ...)) might not have (foo ...) in tail position. Can't be.
[03:44:18] <aeth> Lisp was designed as an experiment in recursion. The language came later.
[03:44:25] <aeth> So Common Lisp is the one with the departure here
[03:44:34] <gilberth> PROG?
[03:45:26] <gilberth> I believe this is a misconception, the program feature PROG came right with the first practical implementation.
[03:45:39] <Jacobis9000> I like recursion
[03:46:16] <Jacobis9000> I never seem to make any errors in CL
[03:46:19] <Jacobis9000> is this natural?
[03:46:26] <Catie> Jacobis9000: that's superhuman
[03:46:28] <gilberth> IMHO expressing iteration with recursion is not a good idea.
[03:47:32] <Jacobis9000> Well I just mean syntax errors, I program things first time, and they work.
[03:47:59] <gilberth> Anyhow, Scheme came much later than Lisp. Begins with that Lisp didn't have lexical closures initially. CL borrowed that from Scheme.
[03:48:17] <Jacobis9000> I think Lisp is really inspired.
[03:48:18] <Catie> Jacobis9000: Ah, well then that makes more sense. I know I make fewer errors in Lisp than I do in other, more static languages

[03:49:12] <Jacobis9000> lol yeah I am not a superhuman programming God that never produces bugs or something 
[03:50:05] <Jacobis9000> I just find Lisp natural, it seems to work as I expect, and I am loving this book Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation
[03:50:32] <gilberth> Well, with s-expressions you don't have to remember precedence, which pair of parenthesis to use and which punctuation. And whether the latter goes between sub-expressions or after sub-expressions.
[03:51:41] <Jacobis9000> S-expressions is the term for what, again?
[03:51:47] * mfiano recalls Racket having an ugly infix syntax (foo x y) == (x . foo . y)
[03:51:56] <gilberth> And since I am lazy and often unsure about precedence, I put in a lot of ( )'s in C code, too.
[03:52:17] <Jacobis9000> I do that in C too
[03:52:31] <Catie> Jacobis9000: I love that book, it helped me loads
[03:52:35] <Jacobis9000> I am not unsure about precedence but I like to make it explicit for readers
[03:52:36] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: s-expressions is the symbolic expressions Lisp is written in.
[03:53:03] <Catie> Lack of operator precedence is a huge part of the reason I prefer Lisp's fully-parenthesized notation
[03:53:24] <mfiano> It's just a pain when you have to transform some really complicated math _to_ Lisp
[03:53:31] <Jacobis9000> Clarity and consistency
[03:53:37] <Jacobis9000> it really is a breath of fresh air
[03:53:45] <gilberth> Well, C compilers also grew a habit to warn me when I say "a || b && c", which is silly, they don't do it with "a + b * c".

[03:58:00] <Jacobis9000> Catie the book is really good
[03:58:33] <gilberth> Another advantage of s-expressions is, that I can maneuver on expression level in the editor. Killing a whole sub-expression is just one chord. Can't work with infix and precedence.
[04:02:47] <aeth> or with LOOP :-/
[04:02:53] <moon-child> gilberth: well, it _can_ work
[04:02:58] <moon-child> you just need a structural editor
[04:03:01] <moon-child> ('just')
[04:03:31] <gilberth> Yes, and I don't like structural editors at all.
[04:03:59] <gilberth> Ever tried to work with them?
[04:04:31] <moon-child> as far as I know, no good structural editor has been devised yet
[04:05:19] <gilberth> I'm too visual for that.
[04:05:44] <moon-child> what do you mean?
[04:05:58] <moon-child> I feel a structural editor is (or--should be) more visual than a textual one
[04:06:53] <gilberth> Most of the time I want to manipulate the character sequence and not the tree structure. It's nice to have structural commands, but cumbersome to me to have only tree manipulation at the disposal.
[04:08:55] <gilberth> Or put otherwise: I want to be able to just type my expression. No helpful extra close parens added, please. And the editor should thus tolerate that while I edit, what is there is not a valid s-expression.
[04:10:41] <mfiano> I remember there being an editor like that bundled with Windows. It's been a long time since I computered like a caveman though.
[04:10:59] <Jacobis9000> I hate it when things type for me too
[04:11:02] <moon-child> in a structural editor, there _are_ no parentheses.  I agree it's annoying when editors add parens automatically though
[04:11:05] <Jacobis9000> If that is what you are talking about
[04:12:58] <Jacobis9000> I had to turn it off in my emacs
[04:13:02] <Jacobis9000> it was driving me nuts
[04:13:12] <Jacobis9000> and meant I couldn't enter multi-line functions into the REPL
[04:13:18] <Jacobis9000> paredit
[04:13:34] <gilberth> moon-child: Yes, and that is the problem. And this is what I meant by "visual". My mental model still is tied to visual representation of the internal structure, and that visual representation is what I want to manipulate.
[04:14:12] <moon-child> hmm, I see
[04:14:24] <mfiano> Just bind RET to newline-and-indent, and S-RET to the default if you don't like that behavior in the REPL
[04:15:14] <Jacobis9000> I just disabled paredit
[04:15:16] <mfiano> I much prefer smartparens and extension packages over paredit.
[04:15:24] <Jacobis9000> I don't see the need for paredit
[04:15:45] <mfiano> better support for structural editing, and for more than s-expression languages
[04:15:47] <gilberth> You find a XEROX emulator called Medley, IIRC, you could run with Linux. It features Interlisp and its structural editor. Give it a shot and tell me if it feels right. It's not for me, it might be for you.
[04:16:16] <Jacobis9000> It's is very easy to close your parentheses especially as they highlight, and, personally I find it really satisfying to do so. I like to complete the statement. 
[04:18:08] <gilberth> And this is kind of ironic, while CLIM has semantics to what is on the screen (presentations), Emacs is editing a stream of characters. Interlisp is the reverse, the editor is editing a structure, while the GUI is just bouncing pixels around.
[04:21:19] <gilberth> And Interlisp put comments in a COMMENT special form, which however kind of nice.
[04:23:25] <mfiano> I still do that myself. I like macro-expansions to include comments for my own sanity.
[04:25:44] <gilberth> Well, whatever you put there, it still is technically to be evaluated. You could however kind of count on the compiler to eliminate unused string literals.
[04:28:51] <mfiano> iirc think I memberp check for a feature in the macro, so it is only ever evaluated for me.

[04:50:24] <mfiano> I should mention, I was being sarcastic.
[04:50:44] <mfiano> I read half of one of his books, and I was torturing myself since the first page.
[04:50:53] <mfiano> Would not recommend.
[04:52:31] <Catie> Early on when I was first learning about programming, I'd say his writing got me set on a pretty good track
[04:54:23] <mfiano> Most of the "clean code" recommendations I read in that book were targeted at class-centric Java boilerplate writers.
[04:54:39] <mfiano> and do not carry over to most other languages, not to mention Lisp especially.
[04:54:55] <Catie> Oh yeah, very much so! At the time I was a C programmer though, so there was a good bit to take away from that
[04:56:09] <mfiano> One of the laughable ones I can remember is:
[04:56:58] <mfiano> a function should never have more than 3 parameters, and if it ever has more than two, you should really think hard...and then goes on to explain "instance parameters", which if you're not aware, I will spare you the pain.
[04:59:14] <Catie> The hard-and-fast rules he puts out definitely chafe. I had similar feelings toward "A function should only be about five lines max"
[04:59:31] <Catie> Or I guess he would have called it a "method", but either way
[05:00:06] <mfiano> Much like design patterns, his advice is for the unsuspecting novice to pick up as some "master programmer" technique that is general enough for every use case.
[05:00:15] <mfiano> When, it just sells books, really.

[10:31:32] <dave0> it was common lisp on hackernews, i thought it would be interesting
[10:31:50] <dave0> i didn't mean your code was slow :-p
[10:34:42] <contrapunctus> I want to write a plugin for a Java program, using ABCL...and I figure the maintainers might not want to add a dependency on ABCL...I suppose the plugin itself can load ABCL? 🤔
[10:37:10] <contrapunctus> (It can, right?)
[10:42:23] <ck_> I'd say so, why not
[10:42:39] <contrapunctus> Cool, thanks
[10:43:26] <ck_> unless you actually mean the very same plugin, that was originally requiring abcl to be present
[10:44:34] <contrapunctus> ck_: yeah, that's what I mean...do you mean to say the plugin which requires ABCL can't load it?
[10:46:21] <contrapunctus> Like, with a Java file which just loads ABCL and then the plugin code?
[10:48:25] <ck_> the addition of that wrapper would make it a different plugin, right. I don't know how the infrastructure you're adding to, so there might not be much of a difference

[12:08:21] <hayley> That said, I am stupid and use a double pendulum made of springs. It sorta works.
[12:10:08] <selwyn> best practice would be sth like verlet integration, or implicit euler (?) integration
[12:10:17] <selwyn> that preserves the energy

[13:07:11] <selwyn> could you use a small modular reactor to power a nuclear sub?
[13:07:48] <hayley> Probably.
[13:13:45] <shka> selwyn: lol
[13:14:21] <selwyn> they approved a rolls royce design recently
[13:14:52] <selwyn> and one commenter suggested that its not a good idea to export them to countries that can put them in their own subs
[13:14:57] <selwyn> which is a fair point
[13:15:19] <selwyn> but i guess the nuke launch is the hard part of nuclear sub design
[13:15:29] <shka> i think
[13:15:49] <shka> that nuclear subs are the lesser threat 
[13:16:30] <shka> because, i mean, countries which would have use for those, already do have it
[13:16:54] <selwyn> would agree with that
[13:16:55] <shka> and besides, the conventional subs are without a doubt a bigger concern 
[13:17:21] <shka> vide russian submarine launching cruise missile at Syrian targets
[13:17:39] <shka> conventional subs are usually much harder to detect 
[13:18:14] <shka> and although they may lack endurance, they can still do most of what nuclear submarine do
[13:18:26] <shka> heck, you can even build a conventional boomer if you would want
[13:18:41] <selwyn> boomer?
[13:18:55] <shka> it wouldn't be able to stay submerged for months, but it is still a threat
[13:19:09] <shka> selwyn: slang for nuclear missile carrying submarine
[13:25:49] <pl> close to official, if not official, vocabulary in USN and through that in NATO countriess
[13:26:16] <pl> and there was a bunch of conventional boomers, yes
[13:26:36] <pl> selwyn: diesel-electrics have a tendency to be quieter because they have less "must-rotate" parts
[13:26:58] <pl> it's why late nuclear subs got a lot from creating reactors that could operate without pumps
[13:27:32] <pl> (combination of natural circulation and ram-water intake)
[13:28:04] <pl> selwyn: btw, submarine reactors /are/ essentially SMRs
[13:28:33] <shka> russians literally put a nautical, military reactor on a civilian barge 
[13:29:00] <pl> russians have long line of civilian ships with nuclear propulsion, so there's that
[13:29:08] <shka> but it maybe more difficult to design sub around a civilian reactor
[13:29:14] <pl> but yeah, naval reactors are pretty much all SMRs
[13:29:28] <shka> i don't know, i am not a naval engineer
[13:29:51] <pl> shka: most of the time civilian reactors are too big and bulky because designed for fixed facilities and high power
[13:29:58] <shka> yeah
[13:30:04] <shka> that much is obvious
[13:30:43] <shka> anyway, yeah technically nuclear subs run on small reactors
[13:30:51] <shka> just... optimized for subs
[13:30:52] <pl> submarine reactors overlap with SMRs when it comes to ground-based, and the rare portables (e.g. Army Nuclear Reactor of 1960s)
[13:31:34] <pl> Russians designed a SMR in 1990s by repackaging and optimising an existing submarine reactor
[13:31:45] <shka> which was smart btw
[13:32:20] <shka> Soviet naval reactors are really quite good 
[13:32:22] <pl> the result is a reactor that (if made) would be plug-and-play thing that you can ship on a train, already fueled up, to facility
[13:32:38] <pl> essentially containerized
[13:32:47] <pl> and self-sealing in case of breach
[13:33:32] <pl> for refueling? disconnect steam pipes, put it back on train and send to vendor
[13:34:42] <shka> yup, that is the idea behind the SMRs
[13:35:09] <shka> they did it for logistical reasons, not economical, but the end solution is the same
[13:35:44] <pl> the proposed design among other things was for district heating plants
[13:36:41] <selwyn>  why doesn't russia export this stuff
[13:37:09] <shka> to where?
[13:37:17] <shka> i mean, they have limited export market
[13:38:22] <shka> Rosatom is NOT a private company
[13:39:21] <pl> selwyn: after chaos of 1990s the geopolitical situation wasn't stable either
[13:39:40] <shka> and at the end of the day only countries semi-comfortable in the Russian sphere of influence are willing to buy nuclear technology from Russia
[13:39:52] <pl> SVBR has one *technical* drawback, and big practical hurdle of "we need investment to finish and start building"
[13:40:07] <pl> the technical drawback is the low amount of Bismuth produced
[13:40:23] <pl> and SVBR manufacture eats Bismuth like candy
[13:42:02] <pl> in the range that making two SVBR a year would take more than 1% of global bismuth production
[13:42:44] <shka> time to look for asteroid with high bismuth content :D
[13:43:11] <shka> seriously though
[13:43:20] <shka> the main problem of Russia is Russia
[13:43:22] <pl> i believe there is a lot of untapped bismuth in tailings from some other mining, the problem is scale up
[13:43:29] <pl> and yes
[13:43:32] <pl> geopolitics suck
[13:44:01] <pl> it could have worked under Gorbachev ;)

[13:48:41] <selwyn> i don't agree with this
[13:48:53] <pl> in 1990s it was in shambles, but it could have gone... differently

[13:49:43] <pl> and anyway, Putin and oligarchs set in early 2000s
[13:50:11] <pl> I do remember the speculation that Putin orchestrated the way he got into power (i.e. that Yeltsin didn't trust him at all)
[13:50:15] <selwyn> plenty of cowboy american advisers in russia in the 90s..
[13:50:19] <shka> selwyn: the main problem in Russia is not even economic
[13:50:25] <selwyn> america fixed the 96 election to get yeltsin in
[13:50:29] <shka> it is social
[13:50:40] <pl> selwyn: plenty of selling off everything because fall of USSR got them obsessed about cash
[13:50:54] <pl> selwyn: meanwhile some made off like bandits
[13:51:26] <pl> and ultimately, advisors are there because of locals. Same reason why I complain about Balcerowicz, not his Chicago advisers
[13:51:40] <shka> and honestly, say what you will about the USSR, at least it was trying to address social problems
[13:51:41] <selwyn> pl: ok, fair point
[13:52:28] <selwyn> but in any case, we can agree that being close to the usa did not result in liberal paradise
[13:52:29] <pl> I've seen good arguments that if not for Chernobyl, USSR wouldn't collapse

[13:52:43] <pl> selwyn: USA doesn't like democracies
[13:52:53] <pl> nor does it play well with anyone

[13:55:31] *** Joins: pjb (~pjb@user/pjb)
[13:55:49] <selwyn> my point re 2010 is more that until that point russia went along with iran sanctions, libya intervention, north korea negotiations (iirc) i.e. they sided with the western position by default
[13:55:56] <selwyn> only after that did they strike out on their own
[13:56:47] <pl> There was some of that, yes. But the early Putin approach to west is not necessarily ended by being swindled or anything
[13:57:45] <shka> i mean, every single US president started with "Russian reset"
[13:57:51] <shka> and luck how well it went
[13:57:54] <shka> *look
[13:59:07] <shka> and while Putin flexes abroad
[13:59:27] <shka> the Russian state is internally pathetic 
[13:59:47] <shka> covid-19 demonstrated how it "deals" with crisis  
[14:01:47] <shka> meanwhile, yeah, I know that China is evil and all that, but it is also internally somewhat effective
[14:02:08] <pl> internal party competition is crazy
[14:02:26] <selwyn> also genuinely a mass based party
[14:02:44] <pl> and the big difference is that Russia is oligarchic, while look to Jack Ma for what happens to wannabe oligarchs in China

[14:34:55] <hayley> selwyn: I also plotted the pendulum on the end relative to the one in the middle, and found it made for an odd shape. Not that it is proof that it is chaotic, but it's weird at least.
[14:35:11] <shka> *Marines start wondering what kind of test is that"
[14:35:46] <selwyn> trying to remember if i proved that systems can be chaotic
[14:36:02] <selwyn> think i did it for the backwards heat equation as an exercise
[14:36:05] <pl> shka: spatial disorientation machine
[14:36:22] <shka> well, that makes sense :P
[14:36:35] <selwyn> pl,shka: the british armoured program is flailing/failing rn
[14:36:36] <hayley> In any case, a vectorised copying GC has to suffer with having to copy objects.
[14:36:41] <selwyn> because the tanks vibrate too much
[14:37:10] <pl> selwyn: for a moment I wondered if it was the same part of the program that got a certain codebase from Lockheed-Martin
[14:37:23] <shka> well, wanna hear about the tail of the Polish self propelled howitzer Krab?  
[14:37:25] <pl> but that one was armored car, not tank

[14:39:10] <hayley> selwyn: A screenshot of the plot of difference of pendulums. IIRC it looked circular but it rotated around one axis, and there was a bump when it hit the bottom.
[14:39:48] <selwyn> hayley: i wondered what (draw-block ... 49) was supposed to do lol
[14:40:14] <hayley> 49 is the block ID for obsidian (the current position).
[14:40:24] <selwyn> yes
[14:40:58] <hayley> And you can see the obsidian block a bit to the right (it looks like it's crossed to another plot, but that's just perspective).
[14:41:22] <selwyn> shka: it tried to walk sideways towards the enemy?
[14:41:32] <shka> nah
[14:41:36] <shka> it went like this
[14:41:53] <hayley> Unfortunately it makes more sense when watching a video of it, and I didn't record any videos.
[14:41:56] <shka> so back in the 90s we had this idea that we need a fresh artillery
[14:41:59] <shka> so we go shopping
[14:42:02] <shka> we have some offers
[14:42:16] <shka> including german, based on the Leopard 2
[14:42:54] <shka> very modern system  
[14:43:09] <shka> but we don't have the complete AFV, we just want a turret
[14:43:27] <shka> and we will build the vehicle ourselves

[14:44:37] <shka> however after few years we have some proving, and it turns out that they welded the vehicle out of the random scraps they had laying around since the 80s
[14:44:52] <shka> and it had cracks in the hull
[14:44:57] <shka> enough for rain to pour in
[14:45:02] <shka> so the saga continues
[14:45:23] *** Quits: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:45:28] <shka> and it ended up by mounting foreign turret on top of the foreign (Korean) hull

[14:45:44] *** Joins: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse)
[14:45:57] <shka> we could have bought the complete vehicle from the Koreans
[14:46:08] <shka> and that very modern german AFV?
[14:46:16] <shka> now it is well proven system
[14:46:31] <shka> AND WE USE THE LEOPARD 2 TANKS so at least there would be some part commonality 
[14:47:57] <shka> honestly, the whole story is just failure on multiple levels
[14:49:05] <pl> still better story than helicopter purchase?
[14:50:30] <selwyn> hayley: proving that systems are chaotic is usually a tedious but not too difficult task in pde theory
[14:50:42] <selwyn> you have to introduce some mathematical machinery, like an appropriate norm
[14:50:43] <shka> pl: i would argue so, yeah
[14:52:22] <shka> though i guess helicopters are needed more
[14:54:39] <selwyn> would be funny to have anti aliased lines in minecraft

[15:16:01] <selwyn> do you think poland will introduce military service like the baltic countries
[15:25:29] <pjb> Yes, probably.  It would be good. Other European countries should do the same.
[15:25:51] <pl> selwyn: no
[15:25:58] <pl> we used to have it
[15:26:28] <pl> it got suspended, I was effectively in the last intake year
[15:31:04] <selwyn> bad luck
[15:31:04] <shka> mandatory military service of what duration?
[15:31:15] <pl> anyway, ruling party got one of its MPs wet dream in form of "Territorial Defense Forces" 
[15:31:16] <shka> 1 year? 2 years?
[15:31:25] <pl> selwyn: I actually had a deferrement
[15:31:30] <shka> it would be EXTREMELY unpopular
[15:31:54] <pl> was going to specifically take one of the shorter options to change "deferred" into "finished"
[15:32:32] <pl> and yes, it was very unpopular all the time
[15:32:49] <pjb> shka: 1 year is a minimum.
[15:33:00] <selwyn> uh, no
[15:33:08] <selwyn> some countries do less than a year
[15:33:15] <pjb> Yes, that's silly.
[15:33:25] <pl> last form of mandatory service was 9 months, afaik
[15:33:35] <shka> yeah, something like that
[15:33:45] <pl> with certain alternative options for those with higher education
[15:33:50] <pjb> For students, any period breaks your scolar year anyways.
[15:34:10] <selwyn> hence why higher education often gets you an exemption
[15:34:18] <shka> the main problem in Poland is that we did not ever transformed army from conscript model
[15:34:30] <shka> so we have a very "head heavy" army
[15:34:39] <pjb> I'm still convinced by Heinlein.
[15:34:53] <shka> with a lot of officers and not so many privates
[15:35:33] <shka> the result is a lot of units with outdated equipment and few soldiers
[15:35:35] <pl> a bit more complex than that, IMO
[15:35:58] <pl> but essentially armed forces got busted over last 30 years, and the last 6 even more
[15:36:01] <shka> pl: it is the core problem
[15:36:21] <pl> shka: in land forces, yes
[15:36:26] <shka> oh, ok
[15:36:34] <shka> better not to mention navy xD
[15:36:52] <pl> aviation isn't much better either :D
[15:37:37] <shka> well, our mig-29 are probably more dangerous to the pilots then to the enemy xD
[15:38:00] <selwyn> bringing back national service is relatively popular here
[15:38:16] <shka> oh, really?
[15:38:24] <selwyn> yes
[15:38:30] <shka> you guys love to waist time i guess :D
[15:38:50] <selwyn> mostly as a way to replace the criminal justice system (!)
[15:38:57] <pl> ...
[15:39:01] <shka> what?
[15:39:38] <shka> you can't just send criminals to australia?
[15:39:41] <pjb> It's educational.
[15:39:41] <shka> or something :D
[15:39:47] <selwyn> in response to anti-social criminal behaviour, people often say, bring back national service and it will teach them some sense
[15:40:00] <pjb> Not yet. Eventually we might send them to Mars or somewhere…
[15:40:40] <selwyn> 1) not the function of military service to reform character 2) if we bring back national service for this, then everyone's kid will have to do it at some point, and not just the troublemakers you don't like
[15:40:42] <pl> ah, the "we don't like young people whom we robbed of future so lets kick them even lower in case they get ideas" law
[15:40:53] <selwyn> find it very hard to understand why people don't understand 2)
[15:41:17] <shka> we need to send criminals to army, to show em some and form the HARDENED CRIMINALS :D
[15:41:22] <selwyn> shka: yes
[15:41:47] <shka> seriously though, i have professional soldiers as friends
[15:41:51] <pjb> Choices can be made at any point: some can become hardened honest people.
[15:41:52] <shka> some come from broken homes
[15:42:14] <shka> but the thing is, they are nice guys, just had shitty life 
[15:42:43] <shka> and army was just something that they could do
[15:42:45] <pl> selwyn: it sounds to me like continuation of the frankly evil ASBOs
[15:43:01] <selwyn> yes asbo mentality
[15:43:08] <pl> where some were worded in a way that essentially made living in someone's own flat illegal
[15:43:27] <selwyn> it does feel like we have returned to 2005 in the last couple of years tbh
[15:43:30] <selwyn> similar moral panics

[15:47:23] <Jacobis9000> I've had to change my keyboard input source to Australian so I can type a hash
[15:52:14] <gilberth> Why do monospace fonts and proportional fonts never mix well, when set to the same size? I noticed that both Firefox and Chrome default to 16px for the font size, while TT and friends set a monospace font at size 13px.
[15:52:39] <selwyn> i suppose the better way to do it is to set alt as meta inside emacs, and not the keymap
[15:52:47] <selwyn> though i have no experience
[15:53:04] <gilberth> And that combination of 16px and 13px seems to work out ok. *sigh*
[15:53:29] <Jacobis9000> Ah I will look into that Selwyn thanks
[15:53:39] <Jacobis9000> Monospace is my fave type of font
[15:54:27] <Jacobis9000> Selwyn are you Welsh? You have a Welsh name
[15:54:36] <gilberth> Which one? There are plenty of monospace fonts.
[15:54:49] <Jacobis9000> Monospace is my favourite font-family
[15:55:17] <Jacobis9000> My most favourite of all was term.ttf but I can't find that anywhere now
[15:55:47] <selwyn> i get that a lot
[15:55:51] <selwyn> but the etymology is not certain
[15:56:28] <selwyn> wait, it is actually a welsh name? i only heard that it sounds welsh
[15:56:31] <Jacobis9000> I'm pretty sure it's Welsh, I am Welsh and I have known a few Selwyns in my time
[15:56:39] <selwyn> oh wow ok
[15:57:03] <Jacobis9000> Sometimes as a surname
[15:57:04] <selwyn> i am english and have never met anyone else with my name personally
[15:57:09] <selwyn> yes more common as a surname
[15:57:17] <Jacobis9000> But it is also a first name

[15:58:34] <Jacobis9000> Did you parents just like it?
[15:59:14] <selwyn> well, it is actually a portmanteau of two different names

[16:01:32] <selwyn> it is a bit embarrassing
[16:01:32] <Jacobis9000> In trying to create a new word, your parents gave you an ancient Welsh name
[16:01:34] <Jacobis9000> I like that 
[16:01:46] <selwyn> some theories that it comes from latin or middle english
[16:01:53] <selwyn> but i like my name
[16:01:57] <Jacobis9000> Welsh and Latin are hard to separate
[16:02:12] <Jacobis9000> There's a lot of Latin in modern Welsh
[16:03:26] <selwyn> i thought a little about learning welsh
[16:03:38] <selwyn> it is the ancient british language in a deep sense
[16:03:46] <Jacobis9000> I started some time ago but didn't keep it up
[16:03:51] <Jacobis9000> It is the oldest living British language
[16:04:08] <Jacobis9000> probably related to the original British too, since the Celts did not invade, but settled alongside
[16:04:30] <Jacobis9000> but I do not know about that

[16:12:11] <taeaad> I would be stationed in Ireland if I were a secret agent. The Irish would insist that I were theirs after all (and they would be right).
[16:13:23] <Jacobis9000> I like Irish people, but the Republic of Ireland pisses me off, but lets not get on to politics
[16:13:41] <taeaad> Guiness and potatoes sounds pretty good to me. (Also the Irish think that my accent is from some remote Irish village.)
[16:14:12] <Jacobis9000> Guinness in Ireland is much better than in the UK because a lot of people are drinking it and it stays fresh
[16:14:36] <taeaad> Yes and you have multiple options.
[16:16:40] <taeaad> I am agnostic about politics. Identity doesn't have anything to do with politics and shouldn't. I would probably like living in Wales too.
[16:21:03] <taeaad> Jacobis9000: The issue with alt is a bit odd for me re: MacOS. Wouldn't alt work as meta by default?
[16:22:11] <pjb> taeaad: not necessarily.  Command is arguably the macOS Meta.
[16:22:29] <pjb> taeaad: note there's no Command-<key> in emacs key bindings.
[16:22:49] <taeaad> I didn't realise that.
[16:23:04] <pjb> On the other hand, there's both Alt- and Meta-.
[16:23:33] <pjb> Early mappings were done from Command- to Control- but it's also different and we can have Control-Command- bindings in macOS…
[16:23:38] <taeaad> On Linux you probably have Command as "Super" in your system settings.
[16:23:46] <pjb> Possibly.
[16:24:04] <pjb> Or Command->Meta and keep Alt- for AltGr and Alt- bindings.
[16:24:20] <Jacobis9000> https://theconversation.com/witchtok-the-rise-of-the-occult-on-social-media-has-eerie-parallels-with-the-16th-century-168322?utm_source=pocket-newtab-global-en-GB
[16:24:26] <pjb> Notably, apps such as Terminal, X11, etc, have the option of mapping Command- to Meta-
[16:24:37] <Jacobis9000> The occult on TikTok. I studied a bit of magic while I was at university.
[16:24:42] <taeaad> AltGr should also solve the hash issue. (Or can, I mean.)
[16:25:21] <Jacobis9000> Alt is not meta by defaulty
[16:25:51] <Jacobis9000> on UK Mac kb alt is necessary for hash key, but set as meta, both Alt and Alt Gr are meta key and do not print the hash key, so I had to switch to Australian keyboard
[16:26:01] <gilberth> It's a mess, the Command key is clobbered by all kind default accelerators and thus pretty unusable as a meta key, while I need an alt key [which usually is option] for accents or umlauts. Luckily Emacs could have the left alt key as meta and the right alt key for the different keymap level for accents and a lot of otherwise useful characters.
[16:26:19] <gilberth> The Mac is really short of modifier bits.
[16:26:21] <Jacobis9000> I can now not print the British pound sterling symbol because of crazy Mac keyboards
[16:26:29] <pjb> Terminal.app has: "Use Option as Meta"  (Option- and Alt- are often the same key).
[16:26:29] <pjb> while XQuartz has: "Enable key equivalents under X11" which maps Command to Meta, and "Option keys send Alt_L and Alt_R" (instead of Mode_Switch), which then can be configured to be mapped to Meta.
[16:27:24] <gilberth> pjb: Yes, but Terminal.app cannot have both accented characters and a meta key. Unlike Emacs.
[16:27:55] <pjb> gilberth: even X11 is short of modifier bits: https://groupbuys.mechboards.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hyper7-6.png  but on the other hand, it's hard to have more than 10 of them for normal people, (you can use the nose to type the key once you've keyed the 10 modifiers).
[16:28:10] <gilberth> And to me the Command key is no option to use as a Meta key.
[16:28:48] <gilberth> pjb: Well, five is more than one usable. And is it really only five with X11?
[16:30:53] <dave0> nite all
[16:31:19] <selwyn> the easiest option for me was to give up on the pound sign
[16:31:24] <gilberth> pjb: I still don't know what "SMOL" is, sounds like "s[ch]mollen" which would be "to sulk" or sth.
[16:31:44] * pl is used for "smol" to be cutesy "small"
[16:32:03] <selwyn> me too lol
[16:32:37] <gilberth> selwyn: I wonder who put "§" on the any key with Macs, must have been Germans.
[16:32:55] <pjb> gilberth: no, X11 supports 8 of them.
[16:33:14] <pjb> 3 of them are "unnamed", named Mod1 Mod2 Mod3.

[16:38:16] <gilberth> pl: Yes, as I said. I need the other for accents, umlauts rather.
[16:38:33] <pl> gilberth: polish keyboard similarly needs it
[16:38:48] <pl> that's why I have just that setting enabled in my emacs
[16:39:16] <gilberth> pl: I use an US layout, since I could think.
[16:39:48] <pl> gilberth: polish "programmer's" (the only one 99% people ever see) is US layout with AltGr for polish-specific letters
[16:40:09] <gilberth> So there are no extra keys for "ä", "ü", "ö", nor "ß".
[16:40:30] <selwyn> i should do that actually
[16:41:09] <gilberth> pl: A German layout does not work for prgrammers, as { [ ] } are with AltGr+7 .. AlrGr+0 (give or take a digit). Impossible to type.
[16:41:55] <gilberth> And I type very little German, anyway.
[16:43:16] <pl> Similar issue with so called "polish typist" layout
[16:43:52] <pl> Since effectively nobody sold such keyboards anyway, even windows stopped defaulting to it 
[16:48:02] <semz> I like de neo for German/English/Programming quite a bit. Only downside is that Caps Lock is used for Layer 3 so you have to shuffle things around a bit for Emacs.
[16:48:38] <gilberth> pl: So you say the typist keyboard has extra keys for accents, while the programmer keyboard has not? And the former is not in use? Strange.
[16:49:26] <pl> It also made similar issues as yours with German layout 
[16:49:30] <pl> Programming was harder 
[16:49:56] <pl> Then you had the case that it was cheaper to import US layout keyboards 
[16:50:12] <pl> And a lot of early users were programmers 
[16:50:35] <gilberth> But I would suppose that these days, there is more Polish office personal than programmers.
[16:51:22] <gilberth> This is what surprises me.
[16:51:31] <pl> And close to all of them had never seen a typist keyboard unless they are old enough to have seriously used a mechanical typing machine 
[16:53:05] <pl> Even when local PC companies started getting big enough to possibly order them, there was already no market 
[16:53:46] <gilberth> Reminds me, that I was frustrated as a child when I types "LO PRINT" to the little BASIC computer and it would complain. The typewriter my mother did teach me typing on had no "1" and no "0". Took me a while to figure that out.
[16:55:46] <pjb> gilberth: poor little gilberth.  That was really cruel of the dactylographists!
[16:56:36] <gilberth> Yes, almost barred me from becoming a hacker.

[17:26:14] <shka> hdmi cable can be 10m
[17:26:41] <gilberth> Really? With a 4k or so resolution?
[17:27:12] <shka> well, i don't know about the resolution, but i was recently shopping for 7m hdmi cable so i googled the standard
[17:28:22] <shka> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#Cables 
[17:28:27] <shka> gilberth: see this
[17:28:34] <gilberth> Hmm, but that's a cable, right? I contemplate some installation, rather.
[17:29:41] <shka> yes
[17:29:44] <shka> it is a cable
[17:29:52] <shka> i don't know if you can route hdmi
[17:30:00] <shka> never tried anyway
[17:31:49] <gilberth> *sigh* And "standard" HDMI can't even carry 2560x1440@60Hz? That can't be right, can it?
[17:32:41] <gilberth> shka: Well, the article says 100ohm twisted pair. Guess I would need to educate myself.
[17:33:25] <gilberth> With SVGA this was dead easy, coax would do and carry the signal fine.

[17:52:35] <Jacobis9000> Yes RTFM is my instinct too
[17:52:39] <Jacobis9000> I also love UNIX

[17:54:55] <Jacobis9000> I think next paycheque I'm just adding a third Linux PC to my collection, a mini-PC.
[17:55:29] <pl> gilberth: I believe normal HDMI gets into some ... unfunny frequencies at that resolution
[17:55:30] <selwyn> classic hit and hope
[17:56:08] <pl> shka: HDMI is essentially point-2-point "digital-in-name-only" stream of bits with variable frequency
[18:01:37] <shka> pl: those are... words
[18:03:04] <pl> shka: do you know how SVGA signal looks like?
[18:03:09] <shka> nope
[18:04:21] <selwyn> finally done with gnuplot for the day
[18:04:48] <pl> shka: in simplified terms, you have R,G & B as analog values, plus a bunch of clocks that are responsible for moving the electron beam around, including H-sync (where new line is started) and V-sync (when beam adjustment goes back to 0 position)
[18:05:13] <pl> there are also "porches" which are areas where you send the clock but there's no screen, essentially the electron beam going beyond visible area
[18:05:53] <pl> this means that higher resolutions require higher clocks as you need more lines and more pixel per line
[18:06:04] <pl> and HDMI ... INHERITS ALL OF THAT
[18:06:21] <pl> just in digital form, as if you forgot to run it through DAC
[18:06:29] <selwyn> return to analog
[18:06:50] <pl> so if you change resolution, or refresh rate, etc. HDMI signal needs to change it's signal clock
[18:07:30] <pl> one benefit is that you can drive the dumbest possible LCD by pretty much directly pushing RGB data to it if you publish an EDID with matching values
[18:07:40] <pl> just strip some of the unnecessary data
[18:08:05] <pl> (now, guess why cheapest TVs have one fixed profile?)
[18:09:20] <pl> of course it means that with modern day high resolutions, and the fact that it has to take higher frequencies than analog (due to serial nature), frequencies quickly go crazy
[18:09:28] <pl> (also, why you need to be careful about cables)
[18:09:33] <selwyn> but that is dumb
[18:09:54] <pl> well, it's how DVI ended up quickly hacked up
[18:10:07] <pl> and HDMI is DVI with serial number filed off
[18:10:08] <gilberth> pl: Yes, by just doing the math I would easy get into the GHz range. No fun.
[18:10:45] <pl> one of the tricks is that a display can note in EDID that it supports reduced V-blank periods
[18:11:17] <pl> so you can reduce total pixel clock by declaring "no, I do not need to wait that long for blanking"
[18:11:52] <gilberth> Well, blanking took ages with analog displays, so that makes sense.
[18:11:53] <pl> I think with HDMI2.0 they had to introduce more complex protocols on top
[18:12:35] <pl> in comparison, DisplayPort has fixed frequency tables for links and sends packetized data

[18:13:06] <pl> so things like self-panel-refresh or G-sync are much easier to do, so is display port compression
[18:13:09] <pl> or MST (routing)
[18:13:11] <Jacobis9000> Wow I am watching the lectures by Harold Abelson and I am reading his book!

[19:11:32] <shka> pl: thanks, this makes a lot of sense to me now
[19:11:52] <shka> i had no idea that hdmi was designed around old screens
[19:12:39] <shka> and I was wondering why DP is a thing when HDMI is doing the same thing and have same capabilities 
[19:14:54] <pl> shka: well, hdmi is repackaged DVI, and DVI was both digital and analog and /definitely/ reused existing facilities to get faster to market
[19:15:16] <shka> ok
[19:16:00] <pl> DP is what happened when you redesign from scratch :)
[19:16:09] <sham1> And in progress DisplayPort is very much HDMI but without all the patent BS and whatever
[19:16:17] <sham1> Which also makes it very compatible with DVI
[19:16:59] <pl> DisplayPort in terms of capabilities differs a bit, generally DP can do more :)
[19:17:29] <pl> there are some things that never went into DP (like ethernet channel in HDMI), but that's it
[19:19:02] <pl> DP runs a simplex PCI-Express physical layer (i.e. unidirectional) with limited return channel, but it transfers data in similar way to PCIE - just instead of PCIE TLPs you have DP packets
[19:19:36] <pl> which can be routed, modified (Matrox and others screen expanders for MST-unaware devices) etc.
[19:19:54] <pl> and if you need to adjust Vsync, you can just add appropriate packets ;)

[20:15:31] <edgar-rft> It's when you fuck an apple from boith ends
[20:16:58] <pl> taeaad: before introducing display port, apple used to have a custom mini-DVI (even a mini VGA for a time) 
[20:17:36] <pl> Well, on some devices. I think the weird connectors had short life 
[20:17:55] <selwyn> wonder how much pollution apple is responsible for
[20:18:38] <shka> well, aluminum production is CO2 expensive 
[20:19:08] <shka> it is way cheaper to recycle (in terms of $)
[20:19:19] <pl> If you want an "apple being apple" move with display port, it's that they disable MST and force use of thunderbolt
[20:19:32] <pl> Steel is also mostly recycled 
[20:19:38] <sham1> And the fanboys eat it up
[20:19:48] <pl> But recycling is still expensive environmentally 
[20:20:36] <pl> Gets better off you use nuclear power for both aluminum and steel, but not many do 
[20:20:59] <shka> for aluminum?
[20:21:08] <shka> how does that work?
[20:21:10] <sham1> For production
[20:21:19] <shka> oh, recycling
[20:21:24] <shka> right recycling is fine
[20:21:30] <shka> production is a problem
[20:21:33] <sham1> You need energy for that, and getting the energy from nuclear fission is good. Similar also with recycling
[20:21:44] <selwyn> am thinking more of the planned obscelence factor
[20:22:06] <shka> sham1: in case of aluminum, it is not just about the energy 
[20:22:08] <shka> sadly 
[20:22:18] <shka> because you need carbon to bond with oxygen 
[20:22:32] <shka> and that is both energy intensive AND produces CO2 as a byproduct
[20:22:55] <sham1> Well nothing says you necessarily need to emit that CO2 to the atmosphere, it just happens to be what happens
[20:23:00] <shka> that's why it is actually cheaper to recycle aluminium
[20:23:07] <shka> and why it, mostly, is
[20:23:28] <selwyn> they want to use qc to make the process more efficient iirc
[20:23:55] <shka> selwyn: planned obsolesce is by no means apple exclusive  
[20:24:01] <selwyn> indeed

[21:46:55] <Gnuxie> dunno, maybe it isn't a low key appeal, it would be an appeal if you were saying it would be acceptable to expect household chores to be your duty based on your gender (and not other circumstances) 
[21:50:13] <gilberth> Frankly, I just don't know. Perhaps I am just picky with the kitchen and/or, as I slowly recover, may want to prepare kind of proper food. /me shrugs.
[21:50:43] <Gnuxie> proper food is good for you 
[21:51:06] <selwyn> we should buy gilberth a great british cookery book

[21:55:07] <selwyn> i don't believe it when people say they are british, except maybe for the unionists in ni

[23:32:29] <hayley> What a great guy to talk with! Not.
[23:32:46] <shka> hayley: i have a performance problem
[23:33:03] <shka> that is stuff you enjoy solving :P
[23:33:14] <shka> from what i gathered 
[23:33:43] <shka> my problem is that vellum-csv has a really slow copy-from
[23:34:00] <shka> and most of the time is being spent on "peek-char"
[23:34:16] <shka> and i wonder what is the best tactic to solve that 
[23:34:27] <hayley> I didn't come here to argue. Someone else started that one.
[23:34:46] <shka> ok, do you hope ton convince that person?
[23:34:57] <shka> because if not, why you are playing this game?
[23:35:08] <shka> don't waist your time
[23:35:14] <shka> holy crap
[23:35:26] <shka> my dyslexia is getting worse
[23:35:28] <shka> seriously 
[23:35:29] <hayley> BTW I got a master's degree in refcounting after multiple nerds argued in a thread that I got pinged in every time
[23:35:57] <hayley> What's the problem?
[23:36:11] <shka> well, i think that common lisp IO is actually
[23:36:15] <shka> sbcl to be specific
[23:36:20] <hayley> Sometimes.
[23:36:49] <shka> i am using https://github.com/fare/fare-csv
[23:36:50] -ixelp- GitHub - fare/fare-csv
[23:37:03] <shka> and if only i could get the same functionality, just faster
[23:37:36] <shka> i am mostly using read-csv-line 
[23:38:03] <shka> but i don't know how to approach this
[23:38:15] <hayley> Does copy-from read from a file then?
[23:38:40] <shka> in this case, yes
[23:38:48] * hayley continues complaining
[23:39:04] <shka> but it is generic, there is also :postmodern for copying tables from a postgres database
[23:39:18] <shka> and that one is not a problem at all
[23:39:22] <selwyn> dumb question
[23:39:28] <selwyn> can you just do the io in c
[23:39:40] <shka> selwyn: well, i honestly don't know
[23:40:36] <hayley> w.r.t <https://radical.town/@RobinHood/106393505461073941> A. who gives a shit about pissing off god, too bad B. why do you think they are trying to make the information on nuclear waste sites as unambiguous as possible, people actually think through this shit
[23:40:37] <shka> i was never bothered by slow text IO in sbcl before 
[23:40:48] <shka> so i never tried to really dig into that
[23:41:08] <selwyn> yeah neither have i been concerned about this
[23:41:38] <hayley> .oO(Server's down. But apparently colonisers breaking through heiroglyphs about something scary relates to people not following nuclear waste warning signs.)
[23:41:57] <shka> so i am trying to gather some of the wisdom
[23:42:12] <shka> because i don't have bright ideas
[23:42:19] <hayley> I wonder if you can buffer with READ-SEQUENCE.
[23:42:24] <shka> other then doing IO in C
[23:42:29] <selwyn> hayley: it is an important point that needs a response
[23:42:30] <shka> which i don't want to
[23:43:35] <selwyn> obvious response is that if the tombs really were radioactive, then the tomb raiders would have actually died before they even got out
[23:43:49] <selwyn> lending credence to the curse
[23:43:57] <hayley> The external format stuff for Netfarm just takes reader and writer functions. But you need a peeker as well.
[23:44:19] <hayley> Right.
[23:44:46] <hayley> But then doesn't SBCL buffer internally too?  And it doesn't even go through gray streams iirc.
[23:46:45] <shka> i haven't notice gray streams in the call stack
[23:46:49] <hayley> You sure it's not disk then? Everything's in disk cache?
[23:47:22] <shka> tried multiple times to be sure
[23:48:13] * hayley uploaded an image: (79KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/GQBKSPFCrfZfoxSypojUwKug/IMG_20211110_071754.jpg >
[23:48:23] <shka> maybe there is something wrong with the fare-csv
[23:48:25] <shka> hmmm
[23:49:46] <hayley> IO in C then gives you the problem of getting the data into Lisp.
[23:50:42] <hayley> But you are definitely benchmarking from cache, or the loading is slower than disk, right?
[23:51:11] <shka> let me try simply reading file into string
[23:51:45] <selwyn> wonder in csv files are susceptible to unicode vulnerabilities
[23:51:50] <selwyn> answer: probably
[23:52:56] <selwyn> pulling off an injection attack using rtl characters or sth
