[06:09:09] <moose> Why is chaining a hash as a CSPRNG to derive a key stream for a simple plain XOR cipher not considered secure?
[06:09:30] <moose> Obviously if the key were repeating, there would be an issue. However, I don't think cascading any cryptographic hash function will have that property.
[06:15:30] <maroon> you mean repeating stream_chunk = sha256( previous stream_chunk ) ?
[06:17:12] <moose> maroon: Lets say with HMAC-SHA256 instead, but yes.
[06:17:58] <maroon> because it's 1-way-hash, there can be 2 different 256-bit strings which produce the same output. so that means you'll have separate keys able to converge
[06:18:50] <maroon> not sure if it's "good", but better would be hmac-sha256(key=key, data = counter++)
[06:19:04] *** Joins: drathir_tor (~drathir@wireguard/tunneler/drathir)
[06:19:11] <maroon> some kind of CTR mode
[06:19:38] <moose> So even if two keys that can converge, it's unlikely to be detectable or distinguishable from random still, correct?
[06:19:41] <maroon> no that wouldn't work since consecutive nonce's would collide
[06:20:17] <moose> If you have this issue with convergence, I think it exists in all stream ciphers then since they're effectively large state functions that are one way for the most part.
[06:20:28] <maroon> you can have unknown number of cycles, each of which are far below 2^256 in length, and some of them could be very short
[06:20:30] <sarnold> hmac-sha256(key=key||hash(message), data = counter++) maybe?
[06:21:43] <sarnold> somehow though I've got a feeling that repeated application of f(f(f(f(...(f(x))...))) is more likely to result in a cycle than f(x), f(x'), f(x''), etc
[06:21:52] <moose> Ah so it's not so much that you can compromise the entire state but rather a single segment that reveals the plaintext for that segment with enough samples.
[06:22:47] <maroon> this isnt a crypto RNG, but this analysis of JSF shows the kind of short cycles i'm talking about: https://www.pcg-random.org/posts/bob-jenkins-small-prng-passes-practrand.html
[06:23:17] <moose> Neat, I will give it a look
[06:23:20] <maroon> you dont want something with the potential to converge to a short cycle
[06:23:37] <moose> I actually do, for my project :p
[06:23:49] <moose> I am working on some cryptopals-esque challenges.
[06:23:50] <sarnold> lol
[06:23:58] <sarnold> awesome :D
[06:24:11] <moose> I want somethin that is more technically difficult than the things they have listed but still doable.
[06:24:13] <moose> Just maybe with more steps/code.
[06:24:17] <maroon> that webpage also links to bob jenkins' code, where he lists several length=1 cycles for jsf32
[06:24:49] <maroon> ... and the step he took to make sure he never encounters them
[06:25:09] <moose> They had a repeating key XOR but I wanted to demonstrate how/why the more advanced XOR cipher would be practically breakable on a desktop. But first need to understand and do it myself and then develop a weak implementation :)
[06:25:56] <maroon> you mean xoring a message against "passwordpasswordpasswordpasswordpassword" ?
[06:26:16] <moose> Yeah the cryptopals had one but it was with a 16-byte key.
[06:26:27] <moose> Just very simple, easy to break. One of their first things they have listed.
[06:26:51] <moose> I've never understood why, just always heeded the advice, of never use a "OTP" or "XOR cipher" at all, ever, for any reason. Even if you have a strong CSPRNG.
[06:27:13] <moose> But that is obviously silly, because stream ciphers are just that.
[06:27:29] <maroon> that sounds similar to what early versions of microsoft excel did, where they XOR'ed your password against "VelvetSweatshop" then used that as a repeating XOR against the spreadsheet. So if you used VelvetSweatshot as your password, it was like XOR'ing each byte with 0x00
[06:28:05] <moose> That's lovely.
[06:29:01] <sarnold> cute
[06:30:54] <maroon> against the simple XOR, assuming your plaintext is not random, you can change the N in getting a frequency distribution of every Nth byte, until the distribution isn't random - then you can identify that the most common byte of ciphertext matches whatever is the most common byte of the plaintext
[06:31:48] <maroon> something like this XOR stream combined by XOR against the repeated stream of 0-through-255 was something that wordperfect for DOS did
[06:32:44] <maroon> there's lots of wonderful ways to make ciphertext look random when it really isn't at all
[06:33:28] <sarnold> rot-13 and memfrob(3) are proud entrants :)
[06:35:34] <maroon> you can easily make CBC mode look sorta rand even if the encryption is simply encrypt(plain)=plain, though it helps if you have an IV with some hi-bits set so the ciphertext of 7bit text isnt always 7bit too
[06:36:32] <Alipha> CBC with a key=0 also looks really random ;-)
[06:37:10] <sarnold> I wonder, how about RSA with e=1? did saltstack folks look at their outputs? or did that pass casual inspection?

[08:11:13] <maroon> i know in multiplicative inverse mod N, when the result V is negative, that you're supposed to make it positive with V=V+N. but is there any source that says you're supposed to do the same thing with the inputs for base and exponent in modular exponentiation? so that 3^-2 mod 11 is seen as 3^(11-2) mod 11 not sqrt(3), and -2^5 mod11 is seen as (-2+11)^5 mod 11 not -32 mod 11?
[08:13:07] <maroon> ie the modpow() in .net disallows exponent being negative as if it's the Nth root, and a negative base produces a negative result when the exponent is odd
[08:20:50] <maroon> hrm, though there is an exception to doing that, which is 0^0 mod 11 is 1, but 11^11 mod 11 is 0

[14:21:51] <br1ck> in a prime group or field 3^11 = 1 (mod 11) so 3^(-3) = 1*3^(-3) = 3^11*3^(-3) = 3^(11-3) (mod11)
[14:22:13] <br1ck> if you are in a prime order group or field every element has the same order
[14:22:38] <br1ck> and every element is a generator, aka the group or field is cyclic

[14:58:21] <maroon> thanks Wulf,br1ck. what i mean is, for the base being negative and producing a negative result from an odd exponent, i don't see a case where base+modulus=newbase doesnt produce the same results as negative_output+modulus. i.e. handling (-7)^11 mod 60 = -43, -43+60=17. (-7+60=53)^11 mod 60 = also 17

[15:03:14] <maroon> and for the exponent, other than the case of base=0 exp=0, i'm not seeing a case where (base+modulus)^(exp+modulus) mod modulus doesnt produce matching result
[15:06:15] <maroon> gah, forget that part with the exponent, it's working only when the base is not prime

[21:29:45] <soulisson> Apologies for this question. My english isn't good. I have a question related to terminology. In stream cipher algorithms, should the term "key stream" be understood as a 1. stream of keys or 2. a stream from the key or 3. a key as a stream 4. something else?
[21:30:44] <Alipha> soulisson: 2, maybe 3
[21:32:37] <soulisson> Alipha, ok, thanks a lot. Sorry for the stupid question
[21:34:14] <Alipha> soulisson: a "key stream" is a stream of bytes generated from a key. so, 2. though considering that if an attacker can obtain the key stream, then it's just as good as having the key itself (well, except the attacker won't be able to generate more of the stream), the key stream must be kept secret and therefore is itself basically a key. i.e., 3.

[21:36:22] <soulisson> Alipha, ok, I like "2" as well :)
[21:37:52] <soulisson> plus it translates better in my native language :)
[21:39:21] <Alipha> soulisson: yeah, in general, "<noun A> <noun B>" can be rewritten as "<noun B> of <noun A>", in the english language, i believe (now wait for the rest of the room to come up with a bunch of counterexamples)
[21:39:52] <Alipha> ... though that's #1
[21:39:55] <Alipha> lol
[21:39:59] <soulisson> Alipha, yeah
[21:40:18] <Alipha> so there's the counterexample ;-)
[21:41:25] <Alipha> well, hm. "stone path" => "a path made from stones"
[21:42:17] <soulisson> Alipha, in my native language and in spanish, 1 and 2 are the most probable. I thought for a a while that #1 was acceptable but I don't know

[21:45:00] <Alipha> soulisson: yeah, #1 seems like a really poor interpretation. and if someone said "stream of keys", i would think they're talking about the output from a KDF (Key Derivation Function)
[21:45:59] <Alipha> (a KDF, if you don't know, is a function which allows you to take a key or passphrase and produce many new keys from that key/passphrase)
[21:48:02] <soulisson> Alipha, in text book in spanish the translation is "un flujo de claves" where claves means "keys" (plural)

[23:57:18] <Alipha> Hash: stream ciphers are easier to modify the message undetected, while block ciphers are vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, which allow decryption of messages. however, IT. SHOULD. NOT. MATTER. TODAY. which you use because you MUST use an authenticated encryption algorithm (such as AES-GCM or chacha20-poly1305), which prevents modification of the ciphertext and makese these attacks irrelevent
[23:58:40] <Alipha> Hash: the exception would be full disk encryption, or other scenarios where the ciphertext must be the same size as the plaintext, where you cannot use authenticated encryption. in which case, block ciphers are safer because they're more resistent to modification.
