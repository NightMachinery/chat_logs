[00:01:20] <SysGhost> just make it executable and launch it directly. Less parent-processes to get in the way
[00:01:26] <waterjunkie> i didn't pipe it, i just did a visual selection on kitty and copied into vim and then pasted it, the noob way. I'll send the paste.rs url
[00:01:30] <sukhman> it woks that way
[00:01:33] <sukhman> works*
[00:02:05] <SysGhost> thing is, systemd waits for zsh and when it doesn't behave as expected it get killed with all the child-processes.

[02:30:51] <Repentinus> horzion, try the normal Arch kernel. If iwlwifi works there, this is probably an issue introduced by zen patches. If it does not, it is probably worth confirming the issue on mainline from the AUR and opening an issue on the kernel bug tracker.

[03:25:03] <mpan> If not, then as sheep said: likely a bad entry. Possibly from using the “/dev/sdX” notation instead of UUIDs.
[03:25:26] <mpan> Yes, but you will have to manually mount the root filesystem.
[03:25:35] <sheep> or using the wrong UUID

[03:28:42] <franklin68> thing is, this fstab file has been working for months . . . so doesn't seem like that would be the problem
[03:29:11] <mpan> Indeed, and typically it’s the use of “/dev/sdX” that causes such an error if it worked before (due to devices order being changed).
[03:29:11] <franklin68> pacman wouldn't change the fstab file would it?
[03:29:16] <mpan> No, it wouldn’t.

[06:47:58] <smlavine> So the day has come when I have fucked up. Earlier today my Thinkpad X220 suddenly shut down mostly, except it still felt hot and the green power button was blinking. I disconnected the power and battery, and held down the power button. When I restarted it, I couldn't even get to the BIOS. I googled around and it seems this is an issue with suspend/hibernation. Eventually, I was able to boot to the BIOS, and GRUB. When loading Arch, I get to 
[06:47:58] <smlavine> the screen the prints "Loading linux...loading linux Linux...". After this point, the screen goes black and my laptop shuts off. After this, it goes back to the state of not being able to get to even the bios, until I disconnect the battery, press the power button, and wait a while for the electricity to get out or something.

[06:50:17] <smlavine> I'm happy that it's not a problem with my hardware, and at the very least I assume (hope) that I will be able to use this other machine to get my data off my drive (though I'd need to look into how to unencrypt the drive). However, if anyone could help me get out of this sort-of-hibernation state, I would be beyond grateful.

I'm not sure how it isn't software related at least in part, though, since I can (every once in several attempts, after waiting a while) get to GRUB, and select Arch, and at least start loading the kernel. Why that state is kept *after* my computer crashes...I don't know.

[17:19:48] <raster> actually if you limit your composite pixmap to just the client area not client + frame compositing doesnt have to be any less efficient than no compositing (at least for the content you care about for perf like games using gl etc. doing buffer swaps)

How would you go about sorting these out?
[18:37:25] <Scimmia> start with clearing out anything that's installed as a dep but not required by anything. Check all packages no longer in the repos (foreign packages). Check explicitly installed packages for things you don't use.

[19:47:39] <numerical> true but when you're flailing around without knowing how a system works it's really hard to keep track in what way you've screwed up a system and hopefully the next time you start with a clean install you won't make as many mistakes

[19:48:54] <th0rne> af❱ It is a drop-in replacement, but you'd still need to configure it, since wayland doesn't have compton, etc. so you need sway to do more things. However, it's not just that, sway/wayland doesn't support xmodmap, etc. so there will also be other things you'll need to configure if you decide to switch.

[20:24:49] <WinterStar> Foxboron: didn't know/realize that was possible as well
[20:24:59] <BrainDamage> iirc there's some registers that can only be accessed by priviledged proceesses
[20:25:42] <WinterStar> But still, I have to think around the fact that I cannot boot anything such as an Arch USB anyway on this laptop, without access to the UEFI firmware... :( I think dissassembly is still the way to go
[20:25:54] <Gnuman> It seems strange that it's listed as only medium severity. I guess local user privilege escalation is so common now that we should be expecting any hostile user to achieve it eventually?

[20:27:40] <Foxboron> A local priv esc implies you have given the person access and/or this is post exploitation

[21:20:46] <dcand> I don't remember how i did that, but it was sad.

[21:22:28] <drew> could it be that MODULE_LICENSE is just not set for something?
[21:23:10] <baltazar> drew: I think that just means that the general protection fault happened in resolvconf
[21:23:52] <baltazar> drew: hmm it's possible that just building a random kernel is assumed to be tainted by default

[23:01:21] <sozuba> jonathon, thanks for the response. Well, i have a key ID and i wanted to findout what packages in my system are signed by those packages. I am specifically looking for AUR packahges. and for keys that i have manually downaloded to install from AUR. Most keys i know what packages they signed as the email ID associated with the package is for a project. BUt some keys have email IDs that are like
[23:01:23] <sozuba> gmail and other random providers, and so I am not sure why i imported them and what packaage i needed them for. I needed a way to identify them

[23:39:07] <teraflops> Edu4rdSHL: I read you use nvidia, which DE/WM if may I ask?

[23:40:20] <teraflops> I ask because on i3 w/o composite manager I had to enable ForceCompositionPipeline=On, ForceFullCompositionPipeline=On to get rid of a nasty tearing in chromium while playing videos
[23:40:31] <Edu4rdSHL> teraflops, just XFCE, but I think that my DE can't be called "XFCE" as it use a lot of other things.
[23:40:46] <Edu4rdSHL> It's more like xfwm + other things
[23:40:50] <teraflops> I see
[23:41:35] <Edu4rdSHL> But everything works out of the box here for Nvidia (2080 Ti) and personally haven't had at least an issue for years (I has a 1660 Super before)

[23:43:28] <Edu4rdSHL> Nice, do you do some gaming? Valve and Nvidia are working to bring DLSS to Linux which would benefit all RTX cards
