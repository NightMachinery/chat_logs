[02:51:13] <plantroon> I don't even see how it is related to Docker. Find the file that contains those things and edit it. It's completely out of context and nobody can possibly answer it.
[02:51:37] <plantroon> judging by "export" on those lines, it's gonna be a .sh file ...
[02:57:01] <ada_> HighAdConsultan: you literally run those commands
[02:57:12] <ada_> export is a shell command that sets the value of a variable that you can use later
[02:58:00] <ada_> you would set POOL_URL to your pool url with the `export` command, at the command line, then when you use that docker run -e POOL_URL=$POOL_URL ... command, the shell will expand the variable "$POOL_URL" to the actual value that you exported

[03:51:18] <ada_> https://blog.oddbit.com/post/2018-03-12-using-docker-macvlan-networks/ outlines a workaround that sounds feasible

[03:52:27] <CableNinja> ada_, I found the problem, turns out you cant access the macvlan'd ip(s) from the host
[03:52:31] <CableNinja> but they work externally
[03:52:35] <larsks> ada_: +1 :)
[03:53:29] *** Joins: mr4braham (~mr_4braha@ip174-70-222-11.tu.ok.cox.net)
[03:53:41] <larsks> CableNinja: As the author of that article...I think there are very few situations in which macvlan makes sense for docker containers. There are limited edge cases (maybe you're trying to containerize a dhcp server?), but regular port forwarding is almost always going to be easier and generally more functional.
[03:54:22] * ada_ coffees larsks
[03:54:42] <CableNinja> the problem is the host is running other things on 80/443, and we also need the stuff in the container on 80/443, so macvlan'ing made sense in order to assign the container its own external ip
[03:55:21] <ada_> you could assign another IP address to your host and bind the container to that IP instead
[03:55:29] <ada_> with regular port publishing
[03:55:36] <CableNinja> not with the way the app is setup
[03:55:41] <CableNinja> (not my choice)
[03:55:46] <ada_> the app always binds on 0.0.0.0?
[03:55:50] <CableNinja> of course it does
[03:55:53] <CableNinja> why wouldnt it :)
[03:55:58] <ada_> lamesauce
[03:56:11] <larsks> CableNinja: that's not a problem though, because who cares what the app does in the container? You can still bind the published port to a specific host ip.
[03:56:21] <ada_> I guess its not containerized
[03:56:33] <larsks> Oh, I see, you mean the app on the host.
[03:56:37] <CableNinja> right
[03:56:38] <larsks> I misread that.

[09:26:37] <zoredache> hackinghorn: you can have docker run be interactive or not depending on which options you pass
[09:27:20] <zoredache> hackinghorn: `docker run -d image` runs in the background. `docker run -it image` runs in the foreground with an TTY assigned for interaction
[09:27:38] <hackinghorn> ahh thankss, I think I found it

[13:23:04] <faceface> hello
[13:24:07] <faceface> My docker-compose / docker networking skills are very weak. If the following problem is super trivial, please point me at where to read...
[13:25:30] <faceface> I have three web services orchestrated by docker-compose. One html server and two 'backend' REST servers. When I 'docker-compose up' they all start correctly and can 'see' each other correctly
[13:27:08] <faceface> My problem is when I want to interact with the html server on my lan... I've opened it's port 80 to a random port on my laptop, and opening that in the browser shows the expected webpage. However, when that webpage tries to fetch resources from the backend rest server, I get a cors error
[13:28:41] *** Quits: plantroon (~plantroon@91.236.69.232) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[13:28:52] <faceface> I don't have enough networking skills to really describe the problem clearly
[13:30:32] <faceface> Each service has a config file where it picks up the details of the other services so that they can communicate. When I was using IP addresses (which was very fragile) it all worked. I could look at the html site using the docker network on my laptop, and there was no CORS issue
[13:31:23] <faceface> I switched to compose so that each service would get a 'name' on the (docker?) network... the problem is that my lan can't see those names... (I mean... I guess that's the problem).
[13:31:41] <faceface> So I'm not sure if I should try to debug CORS or debug docker-compose...
[13:32:00] <faceface> I'm going to look for a tutorial covering this...
[13:32:22] <faceface> My aim is to package a demo that my colleagues can just fire up and see.

[18:30:32] <ada_> if you have 4 cores and you want your container to only use 75% of the available cpu, you'd set --cpus to 3 - you could set cpu-shares to something less than 1024, like the docs say, to reduce the amount of cpu priority your process gets

[19:24:57] <tetrapod> Thx :). Would you also happen to know a good way to provide a username and password for the git URL? I'd prefer to not store it in a file. Tried docker login but that doesn't seem to wor k for git repo's. 
[19:25:13] <ada_> tetrapod: build args
[19:25:36] <tetrapod> That would still end up in my compose file I think?..
[19:25:37] <ada_> supply build args to your builder, or else use a multistage build where your ssh key is present in the clone stage but isn't in the "build" stage
[19:26:39] <ada_> you don't need to set them in your compose file, you can feed them into the build process separately.  or you could use variable expansion in your compsoe file and `export` the secrets into your shell
[19:28:10] <tetrapod> THere's no way to have it ask for my username and password, like a normal git clone/pull/push ?
[19:28:34] <tabakhase> tetrapod then multistage build (and shipping in secrets) is likely your way to go...
[19:28:54] <programmerq> buildkit has build time secrets too
[19:28:54] <ada_> tetrapod: a "normal" git operation uses ssh ketys
[19:29:22] <ada_> tetrapod: if you want to use username/password, then feed build args into your build process 
[19:29:28] <tabakhase> (multistage as in "multiple FROMs in the same dockerfile to make sure your secret does not end up in the image-output)
[19:30:18] <tabakhase> also "git asking for username" is about to stop (at least for github) anyhow, so if that is your workflow, expect that to change ratehr soonish ;-)
[19:30:33] <ada_> yeah the username/password auth method is being deprecated on github

[19:54:31] <RunLevelRobot> well i am the provider

[19:54:41] <RunLevelRobot> i guess or i am not understanding it
[19:55:21] <tabakhase> from the title that reads like option 2 ive mentioned - "make containers use vpn to get to internet" (whats as said a hot mess)

[23:18:20] <Lutin> when you use an image as base, do you messup it's entrypoint ?
[23:18:42] <gooble_gobble> hey folks. I am running docker in docker (i have mounted the host's /var/run/docker.sock in the container). I am having an issue that i think is related to permissions. The dind container is creating a new container and instructing it to mount a volume with -v. When i exec into the "nested" container however, the files from the host are not fisible in the mounted volume. Is there a special arg to share info betwen containers?
[23:19:07] <tabakhase> Lutin setting ENTRYPOINT flushes out CMD or so - but thasts the only thing
[23:19:57] <Duality> gooble_gobble: why do you have a docker in docker ?

[23:38:13] <gooble_gobble> Duality, i am running jenkins in a container and I want jenkins to be able to run pipeline steps in a container
[23:38:31] <gooble_gobble> tabakhase, you are right. I read a block that said this method is better than true dind
[23:38:36] <gooble_gobble> blog*
[23:39:06] <tabakhase> gooble_gobble a 2015 blog... from this jpepetto dude r what his name was? - yea... ignore that ;D
[23:39:34] <gooble_gobble> i think the issue i am having is that the jenkins container is telling the pipeline step container to mount a volume. But this instruction is sent to the docker.sock on the vm. The volume being mounted does not exist on the host (it exists in the jenkins container which piggy backs on the docker.sock from the host)
[23:39:43] <gooble_gobble> can someone sanity check me that this makes sense ^
[23:40:18] <tabakhase> oh gawd jenkins :D youre making it worse by the second :D:D
[23:40:57] <tabakhase> so yea, in that case also your middle-layer needs to come from the host filesystem, so you may run the jenkins-docker with /builds (or wherever it is) as bindmount too
[23:42:28] <gooble_gobble> tabakhase, thanks. and yes i know about jenkins :(
[23:42:37] <gooble_gobble> i have been considering using airflow and kubernetes instead
[23:42:43] <gooble_gobble> but i havent switched yet
[23:42:50] <gooble_gobble> any recs for an open source alternative?
[23:43:14] <gooble_gobble> the declarative aspect of the pipeline is a nice thing
[23:43:43] <tabakhase> "actual dind" is nowhere close as bad as it was in its early days - and especially for CI or such 99% of the "arguments" in that blog are wayne to you anyhow - add the simplyfied cleanup (just kill it) & issolation ("two pipelines running at the same time") and "actual dind" is perfectly fine to prefeered...

[23:51:42] <tabakhase> foo pretty much yea - the "copy ." you had before the install will "invalidate itself pretty much every time" (not just your code, but you may even have your gitrepo in there? so looots of noise) - stripping that down to only that one txt will keep the hashsum, and allow to reuse the layer from "the last build" 
[23:52:41] <gooble_gobble> tabakhase, will have a look at the  gitlab 
[23:53:09] <foo> tabakhase: yup, the whole git repo. Well that makes sense.
[23:53:29] <foo> ada_: ah, thank you. Ideally, I'd love to be able to only add 1 item to requirements.txt and it will only install that new item
[23:53:35] <foo> Not sure if that's even possible?
[23:53:52] <foo> As of right now, I sort of have a base image and then I have another image that builds off the former with more customizations for our app
[23:54:09] <foo> I wonder if I can see how much docker downloads from the web 
[23:54:24] <foo> Is there a way to a "4GB downloaded from docker build" today or such? 
[23:54:32] <foo> (I am off the grid a lot and bandwidth is a concern)
[23:54:38] <tabakhase> (thats the doc part on it https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#add-or-copy )
[23:54:50] <tabakhase> and to get rid of even the .git in your COPY/ADD,  make a ".dockerignore" file and use it like a .gitignore 
[23:55:15] <tabakhase> (ideally code would live in a "src/" subdir or such in your gitrepo, but not everyone got that luxury ;-) )
