[01:11:50] <phogg> rapha: interesting
[01:12:09] <rapha> as in, even if it's a fresh boot of both the host and one client, and this specific share is the first mount attempt, it will hang indefinitely.

[01:12:25] <rapha> (and it used to work before the recent os update on the host, phogg)

[05:30:06] <sumthing1980> do you need to use mdadm again if you move drives to another pc?
[05:30:27] *** Joins: structoha (~structoha@gateway/tor-sasl/structoha)
[05:30:29] <Khaytsus> No, but you'll possibly need to update the config to match the new device paths of course
[05:30:33] <Khaytsus> otherwise nope
[05:30:42] <p0g0> If you stripe, spread data across drives (not the same as mirroring), that gets complicated sometimes when you try to move or remove drives.
[05:30:50] <Khaytsus> but yes, so you _can_ mount a raid1 single drive but consider it emergency...
[05:31:01] *** Quits: gline_ (~yashi@p508be03a.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[05:31:37] <p0g0> well, maybe not an emergency, but you won't have mirroring again until you add the second drive and run mdadm on the pair.
[05:31:44] <Khaytsus> Any raid array can be moved as long as you maintain the whole array of course.  I would assume you'd have to make sure the drives are in the right order.  THAT might be interesting
[05:33:25] <Khaytsus> Seems like I moved a raid long, long ago at work and had trouble because, well, one mobo was like 1/2, 3/4, 5/6 on SATA ports, the other was 1/4, 2/5, 3/6
[05:33:31] <Khaytsus> So they wound up different devices
[05:33:42] <Khaytsus> But it was sorted pretty fastttttt
[05:33:43] <p0g0> sumthing1980, mirroring is great for some kinds of errors/events- it has no virtue beyond having a second instantaneous copy of your data.  If you corrupt your master image, that corruption will be mirrored, for example.
[05:34:00] <Khaytsus> To expand on what p0g0 said; raid is not backup
[05:34:18] <sumthing1980> but still raid 1 is what you do to secure your data yes?
[05:34:26] <Khaytsus> no?
[05:34:31] <sumthing1980> no?
[05:34:42] <Khaytsus> Exactly what p0g0 said.
[05:34:48] <p0g0> raid 1 addresses the loss of an entire drive.
[05:34:50] <Khaytsus> If you write bad data, it goes to the array.
[05:35:02] <Khaytsus> If you delete something, it's gone from both mirrors.
[05:35:13] <Khaytsus> raid only protects you from (limited) drive failure
[05:35:13] <p0g0> if one of the drives in a mirror dies in hardware, you still have your data.
[05:35:20] <Khaytsus> raid.  is.  not.  backup.
[05:35:27] <p0g0> that is about all you get with mirroring.
[05:35:35] <sumthing1980> do you need to do anything if a drive fails and the pc should use the second drive?
[05:35:44] <p0g0> Archiving is a different task.
[05:35:51] <Khaytsus> If you have a drive fail you have to replace it, not sure how that's a question.

[05:36:12] <p0g0> sumthing1980, usually all you see is a message telling you that one of the drives has died and you should plan on replacing it ASAP.
[05:36:12] <Khaytsus> If you use like raid 5/6 you can operate with a drive dead, but it's a pretty bad idea to do long
[05:36:12] <sumthing1980> will the ongoing OS be affected
[05:36:36] <sumthing1980> cant you operate with dead drive in raid 1 ?
[05:36:46] <sumthing1980> you said yes nvm
[05:37:20] <p0g0> sumthing1980, it may take you touching things once if the drive IDs need fixing.
[05:37:56] <sumthing1980> yea but besides some warning messages everything will tinker on ?
[05:38:03] <p0g0> That may depend on what dependencies are fixed in the boot sequence, like hardware addresses.,

[06:56:16] <bpmedley> ahungry : They are present in the directory hierarchy.  They are accessible like normal files and directories.

[06:57:39] <Psi-Jack> Personally these days my backups are quite optimized. I backup data, like /etc, /var/* as needed, and /home as needed, etc. Specific things associated, including dumping databases, especially smaller databases like consul, to flatfiles and including that into my daily borgbackup, and yet, for 2 years, my backups for 16 VM's is like 5GB total.
[06:57:43] <bpmedley> Libre1209 : True, I run my script via cron.
[06:57:51] <ahungry> If your backup is on the same media, that sounds more like a snapshot than a backup?  Or does your device (laptop, hardware) have raid? I keep external drives rotated incase my house burns down, I have an offsite
[06:57:56] <Psi-Jack> And that's versioned, nightly. :)
[06:58:07] <jim> I may have glossed over an existing system for backups in borg... I think bacula has a schecule gui
[06:58:38] <bpmedley> ahungry : I backup to a remote computer.  Good point.  There is the local computer with my original files and the remote computer with versioned backups.
[06:58:44] *** Quits: zebrag_ (~chris@user/zebrag) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[06:59:04] <jim> with borg, you gotta make sure the name of the backup (borg calls them "archives") is unique in the repo
[06:59:07] <bpmedley> ahungry : Using your terminology I have an offsite backup.
[06:59:23] <Psi-Jack> ahungry: Yep, My backups are housed on my Synology NAS, and that gets duplicated to Backblaze. :)
[06:59:44] <bpmedley> Psi-Jack : Do you know how much space they would take up with deduplication and other optimzations?
[07:00:03] <Psi-Jack> bpmedley: That /IS/ with deduplication, compression, AND encryption.
[07:00:12] <sysRPL> i bought a dinky little radeon r5 430 low profile video card to test on a computer and installed fortnite. i don't care about this game, but wanted to test performance and settign with thsi video card
[07:00:13] <Psi-Jack> Without it, that would be megatons more.
[07:00:35] <bpmedley> Psi-Jack : Excuse me.  Without the duplication and compression.
[07:00:47] <ahungry> How much difference does compression on a backup system like borg make for personal computing?  Aren't most space used by already optimized/compressed formats (most media is encoded to be small already?)  I just stick to boring old rsync, but my 2 external drives (about 5 years old now) are still not even 50% full, and they were cheap 1TB drives for $60
[07:00:50] <sysRPL> so i enter a game while fiddling with the video settings to test the various effects on fps, and i have no idea how the game controls
[07:01:16] <sysRPL> it bog in a truck and just sat there, whenever anyone was shooting at me i drove away
[07:01:20] <Psi-Jack> bpmedley: Easily 120GB or more.
[07:01:25] <sysRPL> which happened infrequently
[07:01:34] <bpmedley> Psi-Jack : That's impressive.
[07:01:36] <sysRPL> still changing settigns and testing the fps, i won
[07:01:38] <Psi-Jack> Eyup. :)
[07:02:11] <sysRPL> that is everyone else was eliminated but me, and i still don't see how people njoy this game
[07:02:18] <Libre1209> only 1Tb and not full?

[08:18:42] * Sleepy63 yawns and rolls over
[08:18:50] <Psi-Jack> You run a memory hogging DE, KDE, and you run only 4GB RAM. Problem exists in logic.
[08:18:51] <retrosenator> I need a way to kill process before running out of memory so that I don't have to reboot
[08:18:55] <mlu> Dagmar: true, but that's a feature for the company selling it :)

[08:19:19] <retrosenator> jim: raspberry pi as well
[08:19:20] <Dagmar> That's a _lot_ of ewaste
[08:19:23] <retrosenator> i have like 4-5 tabs
[08:19:23] <mlu> and I gotta be honest, I've only uninstalled RAM in maybe only one or two of my builds
[08:19:32] <Psi-Jack> Then I'm calling bull.

[08:21:08] <begriffs> mlu: are you also suggesting that there are times when you wouldn't want to bump a major version when there's technically a breakage, because it seems unlikely to affect applications?

[08:23:21] <mlu> but just take the benefits with a grain of salt
[08:23:33] <retrosenator> so when swap reaches say 80% I want it to just kill chrome
[08:23:37] <bindi> 1) dont browse on so many tabs 2) switch to XFCE/LXDE

[08:23:57] <retrosenator> lol
[08:24:06] <Dagmar> retrosenator: Speaking as someone who ran an entire website and mail server off much less, if you want to run KDE with only 256Mb of RAM you need to _go back to 1999 to do it_
[08:24:14] <bindi> so you want it to force-close all your tabs instead of you just limiting yourself to fewer?
[08:24:41] <retrosenator> Dagmar: well that may be.  but chrome is using more than 95% of all memory
[08:24:56] <begriffs> mlu: thanks

[13:47:57] <jim> well of course coding and committing is saying something... if lots of people are in the project, they're all generally doing the same thing... making a fork of the main repo, committing to it, testing their stuff, when it seems to work (or if you want them to see what you've done so far even if it's not really finished), you can make a pull request

[13:54:40] <Guest6208> The folder is called "help the world"

[13:55:34] <Guest6208> I just made my github, like yesterday or so
[13:55:40] <Sauvin> How do you see this metadata helping with that goal?
[13:56:42] <Guest6208> Of making the world a better place? Through more knowledge and understandings of things, from computer and human beings, things can be altered or technologies can be employed to make things better

[23:23:44] <Dagmar> Psi-Jack: Those weren't problems that had been fixed before, and they also werne't init's problem before
[23:23:50] <Psi-Jack> systemd has done a LOT of stuff.
[23:23:51] <[[R]]> Psi-Jack: yeah, like i said... the devil!
[23:23:58] <Psi-Jack> systemd is not just init.
[23:24:02] <Dagmar> Technically, that one could easily be blamed on shortcomings in NetworkManager
[23:24:14] <rob`> I do feel systemd tries to do too much, I'd have liked it to be a little more focused.
[23:24:15] <Psi-Jack> The more you continue to reference systemd to JUST init, the more you prove you know nothing of it. :)

[23:24:27] <Dagmar> But if one of those forms of progress was a lack of needless root compromises, systemd is a winner
[23:24:29] <syn-ack> I think everybody's main issue with systemd is that it was pushed by Lennart, and he's a bit of an asshole. Plain and simple

[23:25:22] <clemens3> just heard lunduke the end of linux.. saying systemd has a million lines of code.. i checked, is more 600k.. lol

[23:26:31] <clemens3> well, there are a million programs, did I ask for a million programs? what is systemd doing that I need?
[23:26:36] <c705> not to mention using domains to route is generally a poor idea
[23:26:37] <Dagmar> Overlaying DNS stubs was even generally the purview of "normal" VPN clients
[23:26:38] <Psi-Jack> If they did, it was hacky, bad, clunky, and unreliable.
