[05:20:37] <dragestil> Hello, is it possible to build nyxt without guix?  My attempt to build from source seems to fail because guix couldn't be found
[05:23:23] <waleee> dragestil: did you by chance download this https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/releases/download/2.2.3/nyxt-2.2.3.tar.xz ?
[05:23:42] <waleee> because a clone of https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt doesn't assume guix
[05:24:13] <dragestil> waleee: no, because I'd like to build it from source
[05:24:38] <waleee> which commands did you run?
[05:24:42] <waleee> to build it
[05:25:03] <dragestil> make all
[05:25:31] <waleee> that shouldn't involve any guix-action
[05:25:58] <dragestil> that's weird, the error I got was "  Couldn't execute "guix": No such file or directory"
[05:27:54] <waleee> nothing before it?
[05:28:20] <dragestil> waleee: oh, plenty of steps before that. shall i pastebin?
[05:28:29] <waleee> please do
[05:31:05] <dragestil> i tried paste.debian.net, but was told "entity too large", guess the paste was too long
[05:31:29] <waleee> https://paste.rs/web ?
[05:32:51] <dragestil> waleee: 500 Internal Server Error
[05:32:54] <waleee> what
[05:33:09] <waleee> approximately how large is the output in lines?
[05:33:28] <dragestil> 61871
[05:33:54] <dragestil> shall I keep 1000 lines before the error?
[05:34:07] <waleee> dragestil: wait with that a bit
[05:34:31] <waleee> what os are you on? if linux, which distro and version?
[05:35:19] <dragestil> I'm building it on an Arch GNU/Linux system with a recent pacman -Syu (<1 week ago)
[05:35:53] <waleee> dragestil: do you have all deps for arch listed here https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/tree/master/documents#gnulinux-freebsd-gtk-dependencies ?
[05:36:19] <waleee> I think the issue might be that you don't have cl-asdf
[05:36:42] <waleee> that could explain the massive error output
[05:38:42] <dragestil> oops didn't realise it's already 1pm, I'm going to get lunch, but will try check the deps and cl-asdf (my guess is I have cl-asdf because the error log doesn't indicate missing it)
[05:38:55] <dragestil> will check them after lunch
[05:39:06] <dragestil> waleee: thanks for the help
[05:39:08] <waleee> ok have nice lunch!
[05:40:07] <dragestil> thank you
[06:19:10] <dragestil> waleee: I do have all the deps, because if I build with makepkg tha aur package I was able to pass the deps checks
[06:19:38] <dragestil> but I got the same error (guix not found) when doing that
[06:24:59] <waleee> hm ok do a pastebin of some of the lines above the guix error then
[06:25:15] <dragestil> waleee: ok

[06:26:48] <dragestil> waleee: https://paste.debian.net/hidden/08d1b2c2/
[06:30:57] <waleee> it fails to build this file somehow https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/source/global.lisp
[06:32:15] <dragestil> waleee: right, the only guix mention is in a defvar
[06:33:54] <dragestil> waleee: but then it says "; wrote /home/foo/.cache/common-lisp/sbcl-2.1.9-linux-x64/home/foo/nyxt/source/global-tmpODT9XID6.fasl", doesn't that mean global is compiled?
[06:35:52] <waleee> well fail to compile was perhaps poorly worded, it can't use something from that compiled file
[06:36:13] <dragestil> waleee: looks like it's line 73 where guix --version is likely to be invoked
[06:36:33] <waleee> did you install libfixposix?
[06:37:29] <dragestil> yes
[06:37:52] <waleee> could you check if pkg-config can find it?
[06:38:09] <dragestil> what do you mean?
[06:39:46] <waleee> basically if you have a libfixposix.pc file in /usr/lib/pkgconfig (or another appropriate place like /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig)
[06:41:13] <waleee> the guix error is probably due to it being checked last as a mnethod for something
[06:41:38] <dragestil> yes I have it
[06:44:25] <dragestil> waleee: do you mean it should pass some asdf checks, otherwise it falls back to some guix checks?
[06:44:56] <waleee> yeah, that would be my guess atm
[06:45:35] <dragestil> hmm, I have no clue
[06:46:23] <waleee> if you have time you could try a manual build via quicklisp
[06:46:43] <dragestil> waleee: how do I do that?
[06:47:07] <waleee> 1st install https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/
[06:48:00] <waleee> then you need to manually git clone some lisp deps that's not in the quicklisp dist
[06:48:37] <dragestil> ok
[06:48:38] <dragestil> thanks
[06:49:05] <dragestil> I'll revisit this endeavour later
[06:50:03] <waleee> (cl-cffi, cl-webkit, Cluffer and atm hu.dwim.defclass-star , the url is in the .gitsubmodules file in the nyxt repo)
[06:50:34] <waleee> oops, s/cl-cffi/cl-cffi-gtk)
[06:50:53] <dragestil> ok
[06:51:53] <waleee> those should be  in a place where the asdf buildtool will find them, eg ~/common-lisp or ~/quicklisp/local-projects
[06:54:29] <dragestil> ok
[06:54:49] <waleee> oh, and nyxt should be there too if you wish to do a non-makefile build
[06:55:53] <waleee> and then you essentially follow the instructions in https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/tree/master/documents#hacking but you can streamline them to (ql:quickload :nyxt/gi-gtk-application) followed by (asdf:make :nyxt/gi-gtk-application)
[06:56:11] <waleee> or even (asdf:make :nyxt/gi-gtk-application) I think
[06:57:06] <waleee> that will create a runnable nyxt executable inside the nyxt directory
[06:59:18] <waleee> dragestil: oh, could you check if you have installed cl-ppcre at some point? https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/476
[07:00:17] <dragestil> waleee: lemme check
[07:01:10] <dragestil> waleee: nope, I haven't installed cl-ppcre
[07:01:13] <waleee> I guess if there's other cl-* packages installed besides cl-asdf you could get similar issues
[07:01:47] <waleee> had you installed nyxt from the aur repo before?

[10:31:44] <jmercouris> I’m not sure why that’s unfortunate
[10:31:53] <jmercouris> I would prefer a single point of truth
[10:32:17] <jmercouris> Getting people to sign up to our own private bug tracker would be incredibly difficult

[20:46:46] <w0rm> while I've been using Gentoo on all my systems for a while, I like the new approaches people are trying (instead of just creating another Ubuntu clone with a different wallpaper)
[20:47:07] <sirmacik> jmercouris: oh, what was the period length?
[20:48:44] * sirmacik is torn between gentoo and nix/guix approach
[20:49:19] <sirmacik> what I'd like to see is a mix where you can choose if you want to go from binary or build your own with use flags
[20:52:10] <w0rm> FWIW, I've been running nyxt in 3 different ways - nix-store, binary tarball from the web and then native ebuild - and I think only the ebuild kinda really worked in my case for some reason
[20:52:35] <sirmacik> for me the only thing that worked great was guix build
[20:53:07] <w0rm> since I was just starting/playing I couldn't tell if it was me doing something wrong, some actual bug in software or a packaging issue etc
[20:53:11] <sirmacik> but I havent tried yet gentoo on this machine
