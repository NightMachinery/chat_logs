[00:30:02] <ash_worksi> piou: I just kind of thought a general responsibility of password managers was to distribute passwords across devices and that maybe keys should be device specific so maybe distributing misc. passwords is not a good idea? at least that's what I thought off the cuff

[00:48:49] <oldmansong> @ash_worksi I am trying to deploy mailcow into vultr and thinking of perhaps some kind of ansible security scan script and would report back vulnerabilities for the debian machine
[00:50:17] <oldmansong> or some open source tools to check security of email servers on debian
[00:50:22] <piou> ash_worksi: IMHO if you can avoid using a password that's good, if you need a password then a password manager is great, and I don't do the distinction between passwords and passphrases because it's as pointless as it can get: any password should be a passphrase.
[00:54:38] <ash_worksi> piou: the only distinction that I make between the two is what side of the communication channel is intended to understand the password/phrase; if that is irrelevant (to anything we disucss) then I don't care either, but that is the convention I follow.
[00:55:26] <ash_worksi> piou: that said: what do you think of the general rule of unique keys per device per network ?

[01:07:35] <cassy> I'm trying to find out more about first and last point of contact for IoT hacks, particularly, what do attackers do *after* they compromise the device? One thing I understand is that they are selling access, but what type of people buy access to this? I am trying to find answers that I can confirm, not just "perverts"
[01:08:00] <cassy> So in short, I know how they compromise IoT, they seem to sell on forums, but I'm not sure how they make money, thoughts?
[01:08:12] <skill> particularly for IoT? AFAIK the main use case is for the devices to be used for ddos
[01:08:56] <cassy> Yup! That's what I found too
[01:09:40] <cassy> But the ddos attacks we see in the news are not the same attackers that buy on the forums, right?

[01:12:02] <cassy> I'm not sure why either

[01:13:21] <skill> i'm not close to the threat intel space anymore, but I have seen intel research (from a few years ago) that showed these devices being sold for ddos campaigns or a group would compromise iot devices and sell 'ddos as a service'

[02:40:30] <signofzeta> Joanna: A Bitcoin wallet is secure if you keep it on your local computer and protect it with a strong password that only you know.  Obviously, this carries some risk (you forget the password, lose/break the computer, ransomware).  Protect it the best you can and it's safe.
[02:42:03] <signofzeta> There are horror stories about people losing access to their local wallets, but is that enough to make you put money in a cloud wallet?  That decision is totally up to you.
[02:43:49] <electr0n> you should definitely protect access and availability of said offline local wallet. I cannot stress to the importance of this.
[02:44:04] <skill> yup

[21:13:47] <Matt|home> yeah i'll swing by today and ask if an interview is possible. i _think_ i got a call back from one of them yesterday, but they didn't leave a voicemail so i don't know for sure. we'll see.
