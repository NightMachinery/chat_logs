[02:42:45] <bremner> maybe I am just too much of a beginner to see the problems.
[02:44:26] <rotateq> bremner: Which problems do you mean?
[02:45:09] <bremner> the problems that people apparently have with slime from apt
[02:45:32] <rotateq> ah okay, I didn't have to do that (yet)
[02:46:14] <rotateq> isn
[02:46:24] <rotateq> isn't it installed from inside emacs?
[02:47:02] <bremner> I suppose it probably can be, I don't know the details.
[02:47:31] <rotateq> as it's the emacs client side talking to the swank server
[02:47:34] <bremner> there's a seperate CL part (swank)
[02:47:54] <rotateq> yes, the server which one talks to, which can also run remote

[03:32:11] <edgar-rft> Using Slime together with a Common- isp implementation *both* from Apt usually works, just because both are equally outdated :-) Apt packagers usually test their stuff against other Apt packages before releasing new things.
[03:32:11] <edgar-rft> Problems can happen when you're for example using a brand-new SBCL version downloaded from the SBCL website together an outdated Slime from Apt, especially when SBCL internals have changed recently. It often happened that I also had to update Slime manually from github when doing that.
[03:33:54] <bremner> edgar-rft: right. I guess so far I never had to care about SBCL versions
[03:39:27] <edgar-rft> the ANSI CL spec is from 1994, for normal CL programming you usually don't need bleeding edge stuff :-)
[03:42:18] <edgar-rft> ...just looking: I have SBCL 1.4.16.debian from Apt here - the newest version from the website is SBCL 2.2.1 - found no need to update so far :-)
[03:43:27] <bremner> I have 2.2.11, from debian testing
[03:43:43] <bremner> probably the fact that I run testing makes a difference.
[03:44:30] <edgar-rft> braggart! :-)
[03:44:40] <bremner> busted!
[03:45:04] <bremner> "By the way, I run testing" -- debian people pretending to be Arch people
[03:47:03] <edgar-rft> I have one working machine and two still-working predecessors, I badly need to clean-up harddisks before updating debian :-(
[04:01:39] <White_Flame> yeah, I've spent the day getting my system to boot again :-P

[09:19:52] <opcode> Is the "lispy" way to construct a FIFO using lists to do something like (setf *fifo* (reverse (push 'foo *fifo))) ?
[09:19:56] <opcode> is that performant?
[09:20:48] <beach> No.
[09:21:00] <beach> You would keep a pointer to the last CONS cell.
[09:22:46] <opcode> ok thanks
[09:22:49] <beach> Another way is to have two lists, one to ENQUEUE to and another to DEQUEUE from.
[09:23:10] <beach> When the second one is empty, reverse the first one and store it in the second.
[09:24:11] <beach> This solution is also O(1), but only as amortized time.  The solution with keeping a pointer to the last CONS cell is O(1) for each operation. 
[09:25:05] <CodeBitCookie[m]> White_Flame: lagash Oh guys, sorry I didn't respond yesterday, but it seems there was another way with NixOS. I am not too experienced (1y) with nix so, I just did it the normal "bad" way

[13:05:51] <CodeBitCookie[m]> I saw IMCL (IMGUI + ECL) and it was very nice. Although I wanted to know how it works, so I got thinking and by my understanding, ECL turns Common Lisp code -> C/C++ while CFFI is a way to call C Functions and stuff FROM Common Lisp. Am I correct in this?
[13:07:19] <CodeBitCookie[m]> If so, how does ECL know what to convert the common lisp code into, meaning how did they (who made IMCL) make it work without specifiying anything?
[13:07:32] <CodeBitCookie[m]> Maybe I am missing something?
[13:08:17] <CodeBitCookie[m]> <CodeBitCookie[m]> "White_Flame: lagash Oh guys..." <- Also, just a note, You can never understand Nix no matter how much you try. I hate to love it so much.
