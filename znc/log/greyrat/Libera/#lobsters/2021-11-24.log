[02:37:20] <rslabbert> I don't have an account so I thought I'd post a comment about the Flatpak story here in case anyone is interested:
[02:37:24] <rslabbert> I think the key thing that the app store models allows is for app developers to indepently publish and release applications without having to go via the distro package management mechanism or give up auto upgrades. Windows and MacOS have installer packages for the distribution element, but apps tend to implement update management themselves (which understandably has interesting security/repetition of effort implications) or just don't implement it.
[02:37:28] <rslabbert> This is entirely spitballing, but a standardised update mechanism (more nuanced than "kill the app, restart it, and hope the user wasn't using it) that can be natively integrated into apps while still allowing sovereignty would be interesting. I'm imaging the installer could enforce the use of something like a https://github.com/theupdateframework/. It could allow developers to use a centralised or distro-specific update registry (ubuntu/redhat),
[02:37:29] <rslabbert> use an independent registry (gnome/gnu?), and potentially even federate between the instances (ala Mastodon). I can quickly see this blowing out of proportion though when you add in identity verification via say a DNS and maybe the ability for federated instances to provide patched versions (org.gimp.GIMP and org.getfedora[org.gimp.GIMP] if you trust fedora's registry?), but maybe that's what's needed to support the flexibility here.
[02:37:29] <mockturtle> [ The Update Framework (TUF) ] - github.com
[02:37:32] <rslabbert> I know this doesn't address a lot of the technical criticisms of the project, but I think the distribution and indpendence part of the equation wasn't really touched on by the post.

[02:59:10] <pushcx> Huh, maybe there's an idea: if the problem is interfacing with package managers, write a mechanism for packagers to automatically port between package managers where possible, or maintain ports as cheaply as possible when they require human tweaks.
[02:59:10] <kline> reminder: i use debian _because_ of the package management
[02:59:26] <kline> i dont care about application developers, nor should distros: they should care about me, the user

[03:07:25] <rslabbert> Without touching on the philosophical element (my position is much more aligned to a full free software world fwiw), a pragmatic package manager should be able to support just downloading an executable and installing that.
[03:08:32] <technomancy> I guess I just wish the article had been more up-front about their motivations so I could have realized earlier on I was wasting my time reading it =)
[03:09:21] <rslabbert> Or even just being able to build on existing infrastructure. A lot of projects on github already publish binaries with every release, can we download and use those without having to rebuild everything ourselves? If we're already trusting the developers to write non-malicious code, and trusting github to serve non-malicious code, should we also not be able to trust the pre-built binaries are not malicious?

[12:46:25] <bsandro> it probably was copied from the wikipedia article, which wrongly describes zsh as a bash derivative as well
[12:48:05] <gerikson> wikipedia is the source of all truth!
[12:49:54] <gerikson> ``GPU support alone is a dealbreaker (there are not so many GPU supported terminals in the Linux world besides Alacritty)''
[12:50:22] <gerikson> as someone who uses the terminal almost exclusively over a remote link, this makes no sense to me
[12:52:09] <gerikson> but I've run alacritty over a VNC session, and the fact that one can't (?) increase the typeface size is kinda irritating
[12:53:08] <bsandro> there is a noticeable difference to me between some terminal emulators (gnome-terminal vs konsole for example), but alacritty vs konsole vs urxvt vs iterm2+gpu has no meaningful/observable speed difference imo
[12:53:45] * riv wakes up
[12:53:46] <bsandro> moreover if I toggle that gpu render option in iterm2 i see precisely 0 difference if it runs without it
[12:53:53] <riv> GPU accelerated.. bash shell?
[12:53:58] <gerikson> maybe it's a no-op ;)
[12:54:11] <letoram> starts to matter if you run hdpi screen, > 80x25, shaped text with ligatures
[12:54:21] <letoram> before then it's marketing bullshit
[12:54:47] <bsandro> hey I saw a font that was fully made with opengl shader language, I guess terminal that renders stuff only using that would be "fully gpu"

[12:56:41] <letoram> well the intermediate form (sdfs) you could get near infinite zoom with preserved features, but alacritty etc. isn't doing that so
[12:57:47] <bsandro> but it is written with rust, meanwhile it is bettery than everything else /s
[12:58:00] <bsandro> *means, damn my fingers type random words today
[12:58:29] <letoram> much sexier imo is deferring the text rendering to the compositor so that atlases and glyph caches are shared between all emulators

There's a whole minefield of "what Lobsters is turning into a business!" I don't have the energy to negotiate ATM.
[18:23:31] <pushcx> The minefield is - at this point it should be pretty self-evident that I'm not trying to extract dollars from Lobsters and it needs to be unambiguous that'll continue to be the case. Being a non-profit is very complicated and does not address the issue, unfortunately.

[18:53:17] <Teckla> Does anyone else here use a wireless mouse?
[18:53:19] <Teckla> If I don't use my wireless mouse for 10+ seconds, the next time I move the mouse, there's like a 1/2 second delay before the mouse pointer on the screen moves...
[18:53:22] <Teckla> Trying to get to the bottom of this oddity...
[18:53:42] <wink> that sounds wrong.
[18:53:56] <WilhelmVonWeiner> Teckla: it's probably a power saving mode - I know you can disable this on Logitech mice, and there may be a linux utility to do this
[18:54:05] <wink> if my wife's mouse (logitech, windows) would do that I would have probably thrown it out jsut for the rare times I use it
[18:54:13] <lep> i have the same problems with my wired mouse if i enable certain usb power savings in powertop
[18:54:33] <Teckla> WilhelmVonWeiner: Hmmm, good thinking, thanks.  Maybe I need to find, download, and install the proper driver, instead of using whatever default driver got loaded...
[18:54:41] <WilhelmVonWeiner> which os?
[18:54:46] <Teckla> The problem does not happen with a wired mouse.
[18:54:53] <Teckla> WilhelmVonWeiner: Windows 11.  :(  Which is beta quality, at best...
[18:55:11] <lep> windows is an enemy of your freedom))
[18:55:15] <lep> and of your wired mouse it seems
[18:55:24] <ngoldbaum> Teckla: that's the mouse turning off its bluetooth radio when idle
[18:55:31] <ngoldbaum> bluetooth takes a second or so to handshake
[18:55:36] <Teckla> Yeah, after a long time on Linux, using Windows 11 is a big downgrade
[18:56:03] <Teckla> ngoldbaum: Hmmm, it uses a dongle plugged into a USB port.  That means it's can't be Bluetooth, right?
[18:56:44] <ngoldbaum> wait this mouse uses a custom wireless protocol? wat
[18:56:58] <lep> logitech mice unfortunately dont use bt
[18:56:58] <ngoldbaum> who makes it
[18:57:04] <ngoldbaum> wow TIL
[18:57:11] <WilhelmVonWeiner> ngoldbaum: a lot of them just use 2.4GHz band rf receiver
[18:57:33] <Teckla> Microsoft
[18:57:54] <ngoldbaum> well then it's something bluetooth-like initiating a handshake
[18:58:02] <ngoldbaum> still likely takes a little bit

[19:04:06] <iDrougge> And pay less for BT licences.
[19:04:16] <favadi> my Logitech supports both the dongle and bluetooth
[19:04:38] <favadi> I just assume that the dongle is for old desktops that doesn't support bluetooth
[19:04:53] <favadi> never notice any differences
[19:05:58] <lep> from my understanding logitech uses their own dongle for highspeed, maybe for their gaming mice
