[00:00:49] <I_Am_M00t> this is not reality, it's an academic setting, essentially
[00:01:45] *** Joins: Pixi (~Pixi@user/pixi)
[00:02:44] <I_Am_M00t> in reality the outcome of debates are tied to resources, power, practical decisions, and so on
[00:03:03] <I_Am_M00t> communication is going to be a head ache , as a rule
[00:04:02] <causative> it depends on the norms and expectations, and also on your goals and theirs
[00:04:09] <brigand> or you can just put people on ignore
[00:04:17] <I_Am_M00t> things that seem obvious to one group are not obvious to another, and logical and clean paths to mutual understanding is not obvious
[00:04:51] <causative> in elenchus we do not need to have mutual understanding - we just need at least the veneer of respect and cooperation, even if underneath the feelings are different
[00:05:06] <causative> that is sufficient to talk and question until a mutual understanding arises
[00:05:15] <I_Am_M00t> often times both groups have an incomplete picture, and nobody can honestly do much more than make a best guess
[00:05:44] <causative> when the groups have incomplete pictures, elenchus allows each group to ask the other group for the rest of the picture and check it for consistency
[00:06:21] <I_Am_M00t> that assumes you have the time, resources and patience to do research to properly resolve issues
[00:06:30] <causative> yes
[00:06:44] <causative> mostly it's a question of willingness, people tend to get mad when you ask them probing questions about their beliefs
[00:06:59] <causative> many tend to treat it as an attack on their person
[00:07:15] <causative> instead of as an opportunity to share what they believe with someone willing to hear it
[00:07:23] <I_Am_M00t> maybe they're right in a way?
[00:07:44] <I_Am_M00t> maybe the logical decision will mean less power to them
[00:07:52] <causative> if elenchus reveals a contradiction in their beliefs, they should not *want* to hold those beliefs
[00:08:15] <I_Am_M00t> what if by holding those incorrect beliefs you gain power?
[00:08:20] <brigand> yet there are only a few vegans around
[00:09:01] <I_Am_M00t> what if "elenchus" will change up the status quo so that one group gets more power, and another less?
[00:09:06] <causative> well, all we can do is try to promote social norms by which failing to participate and defend your beliefs via elenchus makes you lose power and be seen as dishonest
[00:09:18] <I_Am_M00t> not everyone cares about logic, when it negatively affects them
[00:09:48] <causative> yes, there's not too much we can do about that, but at least I personally see it as a bad thing
[00:09:58] *** Parts: mannequin (uid453465@helmsley.irccloud.com) ()
[00:10:11] <causative> people ought to be more reasonable and we should try to set up conditions that make being reasonable the winning move
[00:10:23] <I_Am_M00t> no shit, yet that's the central issue
[00:10:59] <I_Am_M00t> you have a real world example?
[00:11:09] <I_Am_M00t> some hot or not so hot topic?
[00:11:32] <causative> well, my experience in long-form debates is mostly IRC and forums
[00:12:13] <causative> where I do try to set up such conditions, by the method already described (punishing bad-faith argument by naming it)
[00:12:53] <brigand> people ought to be less egoistic. yet, progress is also made through competition. but if i look at the world, what has this competition brought us to?
[00:13:33] <Ungwelian> Cooperation is much better.
[00:14:24] <I_Am_M00t> ok, i mean an actual topic. like the past days in here have been about some climate change questions
[00:14:32] <causative> competition can work, the key is providing the right incentives so that people are competing to help society the most, instead of trying to directly hurt each other
[00:15:03] <I_Am_M00t> it's easy to say that things are simple, until you go into a real discussion where people have different viewpoints
[00:15:19] <causative> perhaps most of the problems in society are the result of a *lack* of competition - i.e. monopolies and colluders exerting undue market power
[00:15:39] <I_Am_M00t> ok, now that's a topic
[00:16:23] <causative> countries with a greater number of viable political parties have healthier democracies
[00:16:47] <causative> countries with only a single viable party, such as China or the former USSR, do not truly have democracies
[00:16:57] <I_Am_M00t> someone might defend anticompetitive practices by saying it's their legal right, and they people should stop using their services if they think they're a bad company
[00:17:08] <causative> competition among political parties is necessary for voters to have a real choice
[00:17:24] <I_Am_M00t> and that people should*
[00:17:26] <causative> which is necessary for the choices to be good ones
[00:17:37] *** Quits: red_owl (~red_owl@p5b23f9cd.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) ()
[00:17:57] <Ungwelian> In modern politics, people don't really have choices in any case, since campaigners can lie with impunity.
[00:18:06] <Ungwelian> Modern democracies are based on lies.
[00:18:14] <Ungwelian> Literally.
[00:18:15] <causative> it's all a relative matter
[00:18:35] <causative> in democracies with more parties, voters have relatively more choice - now lies are still a problem, but it's relatively more choice
[00:19:02] <causative> and having more parties does help with stopping lies, because each party can call out the lies of the other parties
[00:19:29] <causative> a single-party "democracy," like China's, can lie to their citizens with impunity, because there is no opposing force to call them on it
[00:19:39] <Ungwelian> Mudslinging is just another form of political propaganda.
[00:23:54] <I_Am_M00t> but then again, too much tension and the country doesn't move forward efficiently
[00:24:23] <I_Am_M00t> then again, democracy is only good if it's healthy
[00:24:31] <I_Am_M00t> and so on
[00:25:18] <I_Am_M00t> i don't see any straightforward argument to a question like, would china do better if it was a democracy?
[00:25:36] <I_Am_M00t> it's a big question

[11:55:32] <causative> in order to have such discussions - which are valuable, if we want to talk rather than simply hurt those with opposing views - it is necessary to form a concept of artificial respect, an agreement to be civil and cooperate even though we may be thinking other things privately
[11:57:07] <causative> we may think of it in the context of the prisoner's dilemma, where each player has a "cooperate" option of debating politely, and a "defect" option of insulting and disparaging the other person
[11:57:52] <causative> if only one player defects, he seems to look good, as he has successfully denounced an opposing viewpoint without a similarly severe response.  If both players defect, they both look bad because they are in a flame war.  If both players cooperate, they may both gain something from learning about the other's point of view.
[11:58:20] <causative> the solution to it is to form a social standard, whereby defecting is frowned upon as uncivil and improper

[12:19:16] <Ungwelian> Discussing in good faith is a huge waste of time, if the other person is just trying to "win" the discussion.
[12:19:36] <causative> sure it is Ungwelian , but you can at least make them look bad for trying to do that
[12:19:42] <causative> discouraging future attempts
[12:19:50] <causative> by them and by others who might mimic them
[12:19:52] <pussipupu> The strategy that beats all others in repeated prisoner's dilemma is forgiving tit-for-tat, which to be honest I often try to implement
[12:20:15] * pussipupu slidesarryana  a plate of pulla
[12:20:29] <pussipupu> it's a slightly briochy bun
[12:20:46] <arryana> oooh
[12:20:49] <arryana> ta
[12:20:53] <causative> pussipupu, if you have to, that can work, but it still means you're going to have to respond to "tat" with "tat" often enough - i.e. get involved in flame wars
[12:21:01] <causative> do you really want to do that? there is another option
[12:21:41] <causative> tit for tat also depends on the other participant remembering that you did tit or tat, and counting it the same way you count it - a social memory
[12:21:48] <arryana> i follow good-dog rules, when it comes to tit-for-tat and social interactions.
[12:21:49] <causative> a condition which may not be met in practice
[12:22:18] <arryana> good-dog rules work in any wolf pack, it's amazing
[12:22:40] <arryana> ignore the first infraction.  goes for both humans and dogs/wolves
[12:23:00] <arryana> the second gets a snarl, or in the case of people direct correction.
[12:23:23] <arryana> the third, disengave/ignore.  again for both.
[12:23:48] <arryana> the fourt is a snap/direct reproach
[12:24:01] <causative> in a discussion context, a lot of people think that the "defect" option is simply having an opposing viewpoint
[12:24:06] <arryana> after that, if provocation continues, it's time to deal out damage.
[12:24:34] <causative> so when they see an opposing viewpoint - a "defect" - they get mad and respond with what they see as "tit for tat," i.e. abusive and derogatory language
[12:24:51] <causative> this is a harmful dynamic that prevents in-depth discussion between people with opposing views
[12:26:08] <causative> we can be better than that
[12:26:12] <arryana> in the real world, i almost never have to go beyond gentle correction

[12:31:07] <mnemon> Ungwelian: it depends on whether they try to win fairly or through any means necessary imo, I think too soft of an approach can detract from the benefits
[12:34:39] <causative> you can't take a "hard" approach at all in a reasoned discussion, if by that you mean being derogatory towards the other person, because if they weren't behaving badly towards you before, they sure will now
[12:34:50] <causative> it will result in mutual escalation
[12:34:56] <causative> you can't play that game and win
[12:36:06] <mnemon> I mean "soft" in the sense of not for an example countering/questioning dubious claims to avoid offense
[12:36:42] <causative> oh, of course, an in-depth discussion between opposing views is *all about* countering/questioning dubious claims
[12:36:45] <mnemon> I agree intentionally degratory attitudes/comments are entirely useless and counterproductive
[12:37:17] <causative> that's the cooperate option - to question their claims and assert your own.  Defection is only when you lower the tone and get mad (or appear mad).
[12:37:51] <Ungwelian> mnemon, I've had so many discussions which have been like slogging through mud.

[12:38:52] <Ungwelian> With discussions like that, the point isn't to arrive in some goal, but to resist it.
[12:39:18] <Ungwelian> Just two "prove" some trivial point can take an hour.
[12:39:46] <causative> you may be setting your expectations too high Ungwelian - if you begin with opposing viewpoints, it is very unusual that you will persuade them.  You should *try* to persuade them - that's what discussion is - but there's no sense in getting upset if they don't agree.
[12:39:56] <Ungwelian> It's like some weird cyber court battle.
[12:40:27] <causative> just make your case and question theirs, and try to be genuinely interested in learning more about their viewpoint
[12:41:09] <causative> at least try to be interested enough to find clearly demonstrable flaws in it, if nothing else
[12:41:13] <mnemon> I think in case of opposing view points it's mostly useful to examine the supporting reasons, it's probably not possible to persuade them without pointing out some serious flaws in the reasoning that led to that stance
[12:41:35] <mnemon> which can easily end up in the "mud slog" I guess :P
[12:41:38] <Ungwelian> I don't like wasting my time with people who discuss in bad faith.

[12:44:42] <mnemon> if the first persons goal is to persuade someone with entirely different worldview of how they're wrong in something the goal might be overtly optimistic
[12:44:54] <causative> well, sometimes you can manage to find some common ground - not exactly persuading them to your point of view, but finding out how your views aren't so different
[12:45:07] <mnemon> and the opponent will often be seen as a troll because the arguments are so alien
[12:45:29] <causative> another way to succeed is to find the "core point of disagreement" - then at least you have understood each other
[12:46:30] <mnemon> causative: or maybe at least agreeing on motives if not the conclusions
[12:46:38] <causative> if you can find a way to respect their views for their internal consistency, even though you don't agree with them, that is another form of success-by-mutual-understanding
[12:47:46] <Ungwelian> There are so many trolling strategies.
[12:47:54] <causative> another form of success is if you find better ways to explain your own views to them
[12:48:07] <Ungwelian> For example, one is bogging down the opponent in demands to make an effort for insignificant proofs.
[12:48:23] <causative> or if they find something that on the surface looks like a flaw in your views, and you find a way to explain better why it's not a flaw
[12:48:50] <causative> through that process, you may come to understand your own views better than you did before
[12:49:03] <Ungwelian> Then it becomes this thing where the other person googles stuff for half an hour, just for the other just to say "not enough proof" or somesuch.

[12:50:57] <Ungwelian> It's really typical in internet "debates".
[12:51:01] <mnemon> but I've often been presented with "proof" that is lacking :3
[12:51:21] <causative> you do have to expect that evidence that seems persuasive to you, they will not find as persuasive, because they will view it in a less favorable light
[12:51:35] <Ungwelian> My usual answer to it is "spend the effort yourself, I'm not a google server".
[12:51:46] <Ungwelian> Which of course results in moaning about "the burden of proof".
[12:51:52] <causative> if you show them the evidence and they say "well it doesn't persuade me..." then maybe that's that, at least you have peacefully disagreed and shared your views
[12:52:02] <causative> which is kind of a win
[12:52:08] <Ungwelian> I'm pretty sure the "burden of proof" wasn't meant as a troll tool.
[12:53:31] <causative> although, if they're participating, they also need to answer your questions - you can ask them why a piece of evidence isn't persuasive to them, and dig deeper
[12:53:42] <mnemon> it's meant as an anti-troll tool usually, as well as a check on the supremacy of rhetoric

[12:53:54] *** kish` is now known as GlobalBanksta
[12:54:04] <causative> and maybe try to persuade them that their standards for evidence aren't right

[12:57:14] <causative> and you can call them out on that
[12:58:08] <Ungwelian> Good faith discussion doesn't need rhetorical tools like that.
[12:58:51] <causative> you can't expect too much from "good faith" - settle for at least not being at each other's throats, and answering questions
[12:59:04] <causative> there's still going to be bias
[12:59:05] <mnemon> it's a useful point to make if the claims are fantastic and lacking in support otherwise
[12:59:11] <bittersweetsymph> Yeah I have had discussions like that you get them ABS statistics and then that still doesn't convince them so then I would probably just give up.
[12:59:11] <causative> people fool themselves without even knowing
[13:00:37] <bittersweetsymph> But it is hard to know if people are sincere or not when there are some just trolling anyway.
[13:00:39] <Ungwelian> The other person can also have huge lacks in knowledge. Then the "proof" means that instead of proving x, you need to explain to them the whole framework of an entire area of knowledge.
[13:00:58] <Ungwelian> Which means n+1 opportunities to ask for more proof.
[13:01:19] <Ungwelian> The other person does nothing, while you spend 10 hours googling stuff for them.
[13:01:25] <Ungwelian> It's like being an unpaid private educator.
[13:03:58] <bittersweetsymph> I think you are one of the smartest people on here Ungwelian
[13:04:08] <Ungwelian> Thanks, bittersweetsymph.

[13:14:06] <Ungwelian> The big problem with "burden of proof" is that it's absolutely unbalanced.
[13:14:40] <Ungwelian> One person is assumed to be wrong, and assumed to do all the work for proof.
[13:15:11] <Ungwelian> In a normal, good faith discussion, it's never so absolutely one-sided like this.
[13:15:25] <mnemon> usually both sides are making a claim
[13:15:37] <mnemon> and thus both sides have the burden to some degree
[13:16:03] <Ungwelian> Shouldn't there also be "the burden of common knowledge" ?
[13:16:13] <mnemon> unless one of them is a well accepted one I suppose
[13:16:38] <Ungwelian> And also "the burden of learning about it yourself".
[13:17:13] <Ungwelian> If you make someone else prove everything, they have to guess your lacks of knowledge, which is yet another form of extra effort.
[13:17:15] <mnemon> not really applicable I think
[13:17:28] <Ungwelian> Schools demand it everywhere.
[13:17:42] <Ungwelian> Why would adults be exempt from that?
[13:18:04] <mnemon> you could just say "google any of the thousands of studies on the subject" instead of spending 10 hours googling for them
[13:18:27] <mnemon> schools create artificial make-work so that kids can integrate knowledge
[13:19:39] <mnemon> unless we're talking late higher education the point is generally not to explore subjects and reason about them but to assimilate well established knowledge
[13:20:09] <mnemon> or reasoning tools :P
[13:20:39] <Ungwelian> Or make the other person into a private educator, while the troll spends 10 seconds with any proof they come up.
[13:21:13] <Ungwelian> The troll isn't interested in the goal, but winning the discussion.
[13:21:17] <mnemon> if they make no effort then they unmask themselves as a troll
[13:21:34] <mnemon> no, troll is interested in aggravating people
[13:21:49] <mnemon> it has nothing to do with winning
[13:22:57] <Ungwelian> Aggravating people feels good, because you get a sense of power from it. And make the other person look ridiculous in the process.
[13:23:44] <Ungwelian> You get that same feeling of power and putting the other one down from "winning".
[13:23:46] <mnemon> or perhaps validate your sense of superiority compared to some silly <insert group name here>

[13:43:49] <amigojapan> Ungwelian: I don't think you are assumed to be wrong if you don't follow up with the burden of proof. It just becomes unknown to the rest
[13:51:46] <amigojapan> Ungwelian: do you think a discussion is a game? To have a winner and a loser? I don't think it has to be, tho many people see it that way
[13:55:11] <Ungwelian> amigojapan, oh no, I hate discussions like that.
[13:55:34] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[13:57:14] <amigojapan> I bet there are just many times when the right party does not get recognized as correct. Life is not fair like that
[13:58:38] <Ungwelian> I like good faith discussions, where people aren't aiming to win, but rather establish the truth together.
[13:59:08] <Ungwelian> Cooperation, not competition.
[13:59:57] <amigojapan> I see. Those may be rare in IRC
[13:59:57] <mnemon> it is "competetive" out of necessity for some parts if you hold uncompatible views
[14:00:44] <amigojapan> mnemon: why "competitive"if you don't treat it as a game, it is not
[14:01:53] <mnemon> amigojapan: in the sense that only one viewpoint can be correct if they're mutually exclusive
[14:02:16] <mnemon> of course that assumption might be wrong
[14:02:58] <amigojapan> mnemon: but, you don't need to prove you are right in every case, unless it is life or death
[14:03:37] <amigojapan> And life or death is pretty rare
[14:03:51] <mnemon> but I suppose I do agree that aiming to win can create bad discussion and viewing the discussion as "who is right"(instead of what is the truth) can as well
[14:04:22] <amigojapan> Ok
[14:05:10] <amigojapan> Also harmony may be prioritized over proving you are right
[14:05:20] <amigojapan> Even if they are wrong
[14:05:58] <mnemon> yes, but it tends to get overprioritized way too often :/
[14:06:18] <mnemon> it's also not conductive to actually exploring the matter even if it helps with co-existence
[14:07:08] <bittersweetsymph> Sometimes people if life have the most full on discussions about things completely opposed to each other getting mad, maybe saying things they shoukd not in their madness, etc, then at the end of it all they still have a difference of opinion and are also still friends. I guess it is good to be able to disagree and not let it cause division or friendship. Like having a friend on the other side of politics who disagrees on most
[14:07:08] <bittersweetsymph> things but you are still friends but that is different to more hurtful arguements I suppose as then it is mostly an arguement over ideas not genuinely wishing to hurt the other.
[14:07:15] <amigojapan> Hmm I tend to think people, especially on the internet are very eager to prove they are right, like in the xkcd "there is someone wrong on the internet
[14:07:20] <bittersweetsymph> s/if/in
[14:07:20] <ro-bot-o> bittersweetsymph meant to say: things but you are still friends but that is dinferent to more hurtful arguements I suppose as then it is mostly an arguement over ideas not genuinely wishing to hurt the other.
[14:07:35] <bittersweetsymph> Sorry bad typing
[14:10:52] <bittersweetsymph> On my phone
[14:11:29] <amigojapan> bittersweetsymph: look at the fishies I bought  https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/wjDZH6rw/irccloudcapture3419298900326294865.jpg
[14:11:37] <mnemon> amigojapan: it can still fall under the "what is truth" rather than who happens to be right
[14:11:54] <bittersweetsymph> Yes truth is the ultimate
[14:12:14] <bittersweetsymph> But sometimes people on either side of politics both have some good points
[14:12:39] <amigojapan> mnemon: but it is not always important to provide truth
[14:13:11] <bittersweetsymph> But on here maybe some are just trolling on purpose..
[14:13:30] <bittersweetsymph> Do you eat them amigojapan
[14:13:43] <amigojapan> bittersweetsymph: my wife will
[14:13:57] <mnemon> amigojapan: for some it's just important to prove how the stupid <insert group name here> are wrong again and plenty of other similar cases
[14:14:34] <bittersweetsymph> amigojapan: what type of fish is it?
[14:16:08] <amigojapan> bittersweetsymph: it is called shirasu (white fishies) in the baby state, but I think they could grow to be , what do you call it in English... I think sardines
[14:16:26] <bittersweetsymph> Oh, good for you
[14:16:51] <amigojapan> Ty
[14:17:38] <amigojapan> Unless you really like sardines, this may be preventing them from growing up
[14:18:03] <amigojapan> To eat the babies
[14:19:39] <amigojapan> bittersweetsymph: shirasu is the local popular food, that and octopus
[14:22:05] <bittersweetsymph> Good source of Omega 3, calcium and vitamin D
[14:22:25] <amigojapan> :)
[14:22:30] <bittersweetsymph> I should get some. I mostly eat tuna or salmon
[14:23:14] <amigojapan> bittersweetsymph: those are the only two fish I really like, tuna and salmon
[14:23:28] <amigojapan> The rest taste to fishy for me
[14:23:44] <bittersweetsymph> Yeah they are my favourite
[14:23:48] <amigojapan> Maybe bonito is ok too
[14:24:41] <amigojapan> I am letting my wife take a one hour nap. 5 minutes left
[14:28:24] <amigojapan> bittersweetsymph: if you ever come to Japan, come to the island of enoshima and eat shirasu ramen :)
[14:28:45] <bittersweetsymph> Ok, hopefully one day I will get to go
[14:28:50] <amigojapan> bittersweetsymph: with locally caught fish
[14:29:28] <amigojapan> Hopefully. The borders are still closed cause of covid
