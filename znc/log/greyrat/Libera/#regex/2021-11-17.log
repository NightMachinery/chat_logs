[07:55:19] <Vova> Hello. I want to know if there is a simple way in PCRE to reverse a given string of a limited size.
[07:55:52] <Me-me> How limited?
[07:56:31] <Vova> Well, actually the limits may vary, but I want to know how fast the expression would need to grow with the size anyway.
[07:56:52] <Me-me> Of arbitrary length is probably possible, but not simple.
[07:57:40] <Vova> Would it be just a simple row of groups of one character?
[07:57:50] <Vova> Or is there a smarter way?
[07:58:58] *** Joins: ravan_ (~ravan@user/ravan)
[07:59:34] <Me-me> Smarter, maybe, but not simple.
[08:01:22] <Vova> Can you give me any hint at what it would look like?
[08:01:47] <Me-me> Lots of recursion.
[08:01:56] *** Quits: ravan__ (~ravan@user/ravan) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[08:06:48] <Vova> What kind of advantage it may yield?
[08:12:51] <Me-me> What, the recursion, or the pattern?
[08:20:35] <digitok> not even sure how you would do it, but Me-me loves a challenge
[08:21:06] <Me-me> Perhaps one day in the past I would have.
[08:23:29] <Vova> Well, the pattern.
[08:23:57] <Vova> What is the benefit in using recursion in it?
[08:25:05] <Me-me> It allows you to nest the processing of characters within the amount of processes that have already been completed.
[08:26:03] <Me-me> As an example.
[08:26:42] <Vova> Is the reversing pattern going to be executed quicklier with recursion or what?
[08:27:31] <Me-me> Probably not, no.
[08:27:38] <Vova> Will it be shorter?
[08:27:43] <Me-me> Probably not, no.
[08:27:51] *** ravan_ is now known as ravan
[08:27:51] <Vova> Then what is the point there?

[08:36:25] <digitok> is there a reason you would be using regex to do this
[08:37:13] <Me-me> Hundred thousand, huh.
[08:37:24] <Vova> Just diving into it and curious about its powers.
[08:37:41] <Me-me> Its powers are vast and mysterious.
[08:37:50] <Vova> Also I like using Notepad++.

[08:40:02] <digitok> lol
[08:40:12] <digitok> after you find him
[08:40:24] <Me-me> A quest for the traveller, then.
[08:41:30] <digitok> it's pretty trivial to do manually in np++
[08:41:49] <Vova> How?
[08:42:52] <digitok> ctrl+h, select regex, enable . matches newline, find: .\K, replace: \n
[08:43:08] <digitok> edit, line operations, reverse order
[08:43:29] <digitok> ctrl+h, find: .\K\n, replace: nothing
[08:43:32] <digitok> reversed
[08:43:33] <Vova> Thanks, I have thought of that, but seems a little too cumbersome.
[08:43:54] <digitok> i mean it takes 10 seconds
[08:43:56] <digitok> lol
[08:44:24] <digitok> could probably create a macro for it
[08:44:36] <digitok> then it'll be one click
[08:45:35] <Vova> Yes, but it is still less elegant than one expression.
[08:46:41] <digitok> i don't see how, but sure
[08:46:49] <digitok> i just created a macro for it
[08:46:56] <digitok> macro > foo, reversed
[08:46:57] <digitok> simple
[08:47:59] <digitok> it's pretty much the opposite of simple and straightforward in regex
[08:48:01] <Vova> And it is limited to Notepad++ anyway.
[08:48:08] <digitok> of course
[08:48:24] <Vova> I am curious about a more general solution.
[08:48:40] <digitok> literally any programming language
[08:48:43] <digitok> :)
[08:49:48] <Vova> Right, but this is a regex chat, so I came in for a regex solution.
[08:52:05] <digitok> indeed, but your question is tantamount to asking your GP for the cure to cancer :p
[08:52:19] <digitok> not really, but it's very difficult anyway
[08:52:47] <Vova> Otherwise I wouldn't come here.
[08:52:47] <Me-me> It's at that level where I don't have the free time to do it for free.
[08:54:38] <Vova> Here is the expression for where flexible look-behinds are available:
[08:54:38] <Vova> (?sx) . (?<=(?:.(?=.*$(?<=((.) \1?))))*)

[11:04:28] <Nag> okay
[11:04:34] <Nag> fine, np:)
[11:04:38] <Nag> thanks for the update
[11:04:38] <digitok> i'm working on it
[11:04:53] <Me-me> digitok: How accurate are you going for? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number#Validating_the_IBAN
[11:05:16] <digitok> not completely
[11:05:17] <Me-me> "Modulo 97" seems a bit outside the scope of regex.
[11:05:33] <Me-me> What about all the country codes?
[11:05:43] <digitok> i'm not validating anything, just the format
[11:06:12] <Me-me> They're all different lengths though.
[11:06:33] <digitok> are they? i didn't realise
[11:07:13] <Nag> yes..for my requirement is I need regex for
[11:07:29] <Me-me> Yeah, length is based on the country code.
[11:08:03] <Nag> whatever the length IBAn but with spaces for every 4 digits like below with spaces or witout spaces like below

[11:14:02] <Nag> great....Thanks!! it seems working for me
[11:14:06] <digitok> what about regex people machines
[11:14:10] <digitok> cool, yw
[11:14:12] <Vova> How much would you charge for a string-reversing regexp?
[11:14:18] <digitok> lol
[11:14:29] <Me-me> Hmm...
[11:15:03] <digitok> $yourlifesavings-5
[11:15:24] <Me-me> I charge around $24/h on Upwork, so ... however many hours it takes times that?
[11:15:26] <Vova> What if I owe money to the bank?
[11:15:29] <Me-me> Hard to say how long it would take.
[11:15:52] <Vova> I wonder if it has already been implemented.
[11:16:04] <digitok> how many upworks have you completed now, Me-me
[11:16:28] <Me-me> Juan. I ran out of "connects" which are the points they use for job applications.
[11:16:38] <digitok> :/
[11:16:41] <Me-me> I'm also going to lose my welfare payments.

[11:19:43] <digitok> 07Nag, i simplified the last part slightly, https://regex101.com/r/y10swu/2
[11:20:05] <Me-me> I can assure you they did not find out that I am secretly rich. I own very little.
[11:21:33] <Nag> thanks diditok
[11:21:55] <Vova> Can you at least say confidently that such a regexp exists and is shorter than a simple one like Digitok's?
[11:22:15] <Me-me> No, because it would be a complicated regex.
[11:22:35] <Vova> Even longer than the initial string?
[11:23:11] <Me-me> Not hundreds of thousands, no.
[11:24:11] <Vova> That was what I meant, since Digitok's method above would generate an even longer expression.
[11:24:36] <digitok> i would confidently say that either Davidebyzero or jaytea could get about as close to a solution as you could ask for, but neither of them are here. i haven't given it a lot of thought, but i doubt i could
[11:25:13] <Vova> How can I find these people?
[11:25:18] <Me-me> What method did digitok give?
[11:25:36] <digitok> (.)?(.)?...(.)?
[11:25:38] <digitok> :)
[11:25:38] <Vova> Jua=st a row of (.)? equal to the maximum number of characters.
[11:25:48] <Me-me> Heh.
[11:26:12] <digitok> this channel would generally be the best way to find them
[11:26:15] <Vova> Which seems fine if the recursive pattern is too cumbersome anyway.

[19:41:40] <OTE> that are not acceptable even though they meet the pattern.  In the regex101 link I list the unacceptable values as well as some values that are acceptable.  Thank you in advance for your help and guidance.
