[00:31:28] <hodapp> CrtxReavr: you're asking a lot with me having to hit the tab key myself and everything
[00:31:29] <geirha> [...] is part of the glob syntax, while {a,b} is brace expansion, which doesn't match anything,  but rather generates words
[00:31:50] <n4dir> ah, brace expansion. thanks, geirha
[00:31:57] <geirha> so {a,b}* becomes the two globs a* b*
[00:31:58] <xx> CrtxReavr: I *can* but am lazy
[00:32:05] <ayecee> n4dir: it would be a class if it were a regex. in a glob, it's called something else.

[11:01:56] <hudo> just another question. I created two key pairs in ~/.ssh , one with RSA , one with ECDSA protocoll. Then I used ssh-copy-id to copy those to the remote server.

[13:02:22] <colo_work> it was pretty abysmal tbh. the 2008 and iirc 2208 actively ate data under Linux with all fw revisions we tried except for fw release version 19, if memory serves. which was NOT the latest release.
[13:02:54] <colo_work> and the 3008 in IT mode had laughable performance that shot a ganeti cluster in the foot before we upgraded its fw to release 8

[13:29:51] <colo_work> I haven"t touched spinning rust in many years, and if you do not need multiport reliability (a disk having more than one connection/path to its HBA), there's no point in SAS gear, imho. if you need performance, it"s going to be NVME all the way, all the time.

[16:59:21] <Psi-Jack> grep doesn't remove lines.
[16:59:32] <Blondie101010> joo-_:  many solutions can have the same outcome for simple tasks but that alone does not make one better...  another simpler possibily could be: tr -d "\n"
[16:59:50] <kurahaupo> joo-_: that depends on the rule for which lines are kept vs omitted

[17:46:29] <RayTracer> peetaur: I can't reproduce that, sudo works fine here after bringing network down
[17:49:31] <peetaur> RayTracer: my usual case when network needs fixing like that is the network is down (not `ip l set down ...` but more like network unplugged), maybe on purpose (like a clone of a VM with duplicate MAC or IP), or something is broken, and then I freshly boot it (maybe yours is cached?) and then boot it up, and login takes longer and sudo takes reaaally long, but if you catch it at exactly the right moment, you can usually log in before the timeout

[18:16:01] <peetaur> Herrry: artixlinux is decently reliable (it's archlinux based... so some would say it's not, but I have no problems...maybe because it has no systemd :P); and of course archlinux... which has systemd

A quick search online seems to suggest that might be caused by the sata adapter not passing correct information from the drive to the computer.
[19:51:13] <ShapeShifter499>    That it might not matter unless you plan to use the same drive without reformating in a correctly wired up sata port or internal connection.
[19:51:16] <DLange> That said, you can limit the bandwidth with Linux QoS tools, look for tc qdisc specifically

[20:27:04] <Dagmar> ses1984: Because S3 storage has high-latency for some operations because it's cloud storage
[20:27:08] <ses1984> Dagmar: technically the app isn't completely falling over, but if we look at throughput on the y axis and number of app servers or cores on the x axis,
[20:27:12] <Dagmar> You write to an NFS share, it writes to one disk
[20:27:30] <Dagmar> You write to an S3 store, it writes to several different places and only returns once it's done
[20:27:36] <DLange> ses1984: because both will give you 10GE if you have the right connections. And you can afford that to your NFS server, you cannot to Amazon (peering).
[20:27:47] <ses1984> in a typical customer delpoyment we would see something that looks like it goes up and to the right until you add too many servers and then you get a cliff down

[20:38:56] <ses1984> we know it's the customer's problem their hardware is bad, but i think if we refactored our code we could run better on worse hardware, because right now what we do is dos ourselves into zero throughput
[20:39:04] <DLange> well, it is their software failing in the eye of the (end) customer
[20:39:30] <Dagmar> So beat your devs until they implement a control to limit the number of simultaneous IO requests
[20:39:33] <ses1984> it's our problem to provide high quality software, and if we add too many nfs clients we could throttle concurrent requests to nfs in order to maintain good throughput at a high level
[20:39:36] <TJ-> sounds like a simple contractual issue. App X minimum specifications: requires minimum IOPs X with maximum latency Y

[23:25:53] <Coup> Haha, thanks. I'm new to Linux, so I'm after some basic help. I've installed ubuntu on a laptop and got it working fine. Regarding installing things not in the software manager like free office. What is the difference between downloading and double clicking a .deb file over downloading the deb file and installing it via terminal?

[23:26:50] <n4dir> Coup: some differences. The downloaded *deb may be from unknown sources. Also you probably won't get it automatically updated
[23:27:09] <macaw> Coup: It's usually better (long-term) to use your distro's package manager. Easier upgrading.
[23:27:18] <n4dir> Coup: in general, my opinion, for a beginner it is best to stick to "the repositories", to the way the distro handles package-management per default
[23:27:27] <ayecee> in both cases he's talking about downloading a .deb
[23:27:33] <hexnewbie> Depends on the unknown sources. VS Code and Edge from microsoft.com add the microsoft repos to your system when you install them.

[23:30:26] <hexnewbie> So I give it 70% chance that the FreeOffice .deb from SoftMaker will do automatic updates
[23:30:35] <macaw> ayecee: Although I agree, that if they Coup's asking about .debs, they most probably know what they're talking about.
