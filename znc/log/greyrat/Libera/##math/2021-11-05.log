[06:03:14] <PlanckWalk> The last term of  Sum_{k=1 to floor(m/beta)} floor(k beta)  is  floor(floor(m/beta) beta) < m.  The next term is floor(floor(m/beta) beta + beta) > m  because beta > 2.

[07:21:40] <tusko> The order of the group should be given by \Phi(pq) though I forget why now.
[07:22:13] <PlanckWalk> Sounds like the start of a "No true mathematician" argument.  Or a joke.
[07:22:28] <tusko> \Phi(pq) (Euler's Totient) is #{1,2,...,pq} - #{multiples of p or q}
[07:23:06] <PlanckWalk> phi(pq) = (p-1)(q-1)

[07:30:09] <tusko> This is like a groups version of Fermat's Little Therem
[07:30:18] <qergle> so let's take p=541 and q=547. gcd(p-1,q-1)=6, take a=64574
[07:31:18] <tusko> very specific there
[07:31:38] <qergle> 64574^(294840/6)=1 (mod 541*547)

[07:49:15] <qergle> take a concrete example

[07:49:22] <qergle> say p=5,q=11

[07:49:47] <qergle> with gcd-normalized modulus you get d=7
[07:49:49] <qergle> not bad

[07:51:27] <qergle> i think i've told you before, a has a mult inverse mod n, iff (a,n)=1

[08:10:51] <qergle> i don't remember this being an issue
[08:10:58] <tusko> ok, so Bob takes p=7 q=5 e=6. (N,e) = (35, 6) he sends to Alice. Alice chooses 14. 14^6 = 7529536 = 21 (mod 35). Alice sends 21 to Bob. Bob needs de = 1 (mod (p-1)(q-1)). (p-1)(q-1) = 6*4 = 24. So 11*d = 1 (mod 24). So d=11. 21^11 = a large number = 21

[09:11:53] <qergle> i guess this goes back to frege
[09:12:34] <qergle> so to marry this concept to sets, i guess the external view of a set is its membership. and the internal view is what properties these elements possess.

If a < 0 and x is a rational of the form m/n with n odd, *then* you can decide to define a^x as (a^m)^(1/n)  where this means the unique real nth root of a^m, and this will be negative if m is also odd.

[20:10:48] <Simplar> qergle: but that's not true though
[20:11:24] <qergle> what's not true, that it's 4.995% ?
[20:12:09] <Simplar> The real result is 0.019627...
[20:13:00] <qergle> your answer is wrong, by basic heuristics
[20:13:25] <Simplar> Total amount of results that a person is drunk will be 0.001+0.05*0.999

[20:13:46] <Simplar> Total amount of really drunk persons: 0.001
[20:13:58] <Simplar> dividing one by another will give 0019627...
[20:14:06] <Simplar> 0.019627...*
[20:14:22] <Simplar> 0.001/(0.001+0.05*0.999) = 0.019627... I mean
[20:15:05] <Simplar> It's by basic probability formula
[20:15:37] <Simplar> P(A)=m/n where m is the amount of successful outcomes and n is the amount of total outcomes
[20:16:07] <qergle> what is your "m"?
[20:16:10] <Simplar> so the probability that a person is drunk is made from: 1) amount of drunk people, and 2) amount of positive tests on 'drunk' people
[20:16:19] <Simplar> so m = amount of correctly drunk people
[20:16:35] <Simplar> n = total amount of positive tests that a person is drunk, including incorrect ones
[20:16:55] <qergle> and what is A?
[20:17:27] <qergle> you seem to be calculating Probability(person is drunk | test says person is drunk)
[20:17:35] <qergle> you didn't ask that
[20:18:04] <Simplar> Oh, I got it
[20:18:28] <Simplar> Then approximately 0.95 is the probability that a randomly tested driver is drunk
[20:18:41] <Simplar> and breathalyser verified it
