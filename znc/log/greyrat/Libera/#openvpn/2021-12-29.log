[18:27:55] <wedwards> Hi. I'm running OpenVPN 2.5.2 using pfSense. By default, pfSense sets --data-ciphers to AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM:CHACHA20-POLY1305:AES-256-CBC, and --data-ciphers-fallback to AES-256-CBC. I'm trying to determine if these are acceptable defaults. I found the page https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/CipherNegotiation , which says that OpenVPN's default for --data-ciphers is AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM. It also says
[18:27:55] <wedwards>  'CHACHA-POLY1305 is widely recognised as a suitable alternative to an AES based cipher.'; I'm assuming that they actually mean 'CHACHA20-POLY1305' here (missing '20'). This indicates that the default --data-ciphers is ok. I'm a little less sure about the --data-ciphers-fallback, AES-256-CBC. I found the page https://openvpn.net/vpn-server-resources/change-encryption-cipher-in-access-server/ , which says: "As of Access Server
[18:27:55] <wedwards>  2.5, AES-256-CBC cipher is used on new installations". However, it also mentions the deprecated 'cipher' config option, so I'm not sure how up to date this is. Could someone with more (well, any) crypto experience advice me if pfSense's defaults make sense and are secure by today's standards?
[18:34:40] <xx> wedwards: you could just remove the fallback line
[18:35:17] <xx> and yeah, that article is horribly out of date
[18:35:24] <xx> just like most articles online
[18:36:41] *** Quits: UncleKiwi (~UncleKiwi@user/unclekiwi) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[18:45:38] <ordex> DmanT: '--data-ciphers-fallback' you can't put '--' in a config file
[18:46:35] <ordex> DmanT: in the server config you have tls-auth without any key-direction at the end. while on the client you have '1'
[18:46:50] <ordex> if you want to use '1' on the client, please use '0' on the server
[18:47:01] <DmanT> yes
[18:47:02] <DmanT> it runs
[18:49:31] *** Quits: voltron (~voltrin_@ip4d16bdc6.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[18:51:39] <wedwards> xx: as far as I can see, pfSense requires it to be set.
[18:55:26] <xx> then the pfsense people have no idea what they are doing and should have no business creating security solutions
[19:01:42] <ordex> wedwards: the fallback is when you connect to a peer that does not support the negotiation. that cipher is the one that will be used
[19:02:19] <ordex> openvpn supports negotiation as long as GCM, therefore if a client does not support negotiation, most likely won't support GCM either, so it probably uses CBC
[19:02:46] <ordex> I guess this is the reason for having CBC as fallback
[19:02:55] <ordex> and AES-CBC is not less secure than AES-GCM
[19:03:18] <ordex> GCM is just supposed to be slightly faster, on appropriate hardware
[19:04:51] <wedwards> ok, that makes sense. Thanks.
[19:05:30] <ordex> and btw, the Access Server article is not outdated, it simply includes sections about "old AS versions" - it is expected to reference old options too
[19:06:16] <wedwards> I also found https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/master/doc/man-sections/cipher-negotiation.rst#openvpn-25-and-later-behaviour, which says that CHACHA20-POLY1305 has been added to the default ciphers in >= 2.6. Which would mean that pfSense's defaults are the same as OpenVPN's defaults.
[19:06:26] <ordex> and thanks - I fixed the CHACHA -> CHACHA20 typ0
[19:06:45] <ordex> 2.6 has not been released yet
[19:06:58] <ordex> (you are reading a file from the master branch)
[19:07:21] <ordex> but yes, in 2.6 you'll also have CHACHA20-POLY1305 by default
[19:07:43] <ordex> btw wedwards, regarding you original question: yeah, those are acceptable defaults imho
[19:07:50] <wedwards> I'm going to create a pfSense issue regarding not setting data-ciphers-fallback. I see it's possible to set it to 'none', but that is documented as 'No Encryption', which sounds like no encryption would be used instead of there being no fallback ciphers and the connection being rejected. (I know OpenVPN has nothing to do with that, just leaving it here)
[19:08:07] <wedwards> ordex: ok, thanks
[19:12:13] <ordex> wedwards: in openvpn <2.6 the default fallback is BF-CBC
[19:12:30] <ordex> I guess this is why pfSense tries hard to set something and not leave that alone
[19:14:06] <wedwards> Ah, ok, I can see how AES-256-CBC is much more preferable to BF-CBC
[19:14:07] <xx> don't you mean <2.5?
[19:14:52] <ordex> xx: no
[19:14:59] <xx> interesting
[19:15:10] <ordex> the default cipher in openvpn, when not specifying anything has been BF-CBC for a while. with 2.6 this is changing
[19:15:13] <xx> my 2.5, with no extra config, already disallows BF-CBC in all cases
[19:15:22] <xx> unless specifically enabled
[19:15:33] <ordex> I don't fully understand that
[19:15:47] <xx> I'll check
[19:15:58] <ordex> you could also share your config, to help understanding
[19:16:06] <ordex> if you have --cipher $something, you are changing the default
[19:17:02] <xx> I don't have `--cipher $something` because that option is deprecated
[19:17:14] <xx> I only have `--data-ciphers $mylist`
[19:17:48] <wedwards> From the manpage: " When cipher negotiation (NCP) is allowed, OpenVPN 2.4 and newer on both client and server side will automatically upgrade to AES-256-GCM."
[19:18:40] <xx> anyway looks like you're right, and 2.6 will do a better job of gutting bad practices from openvpn
[19:18:59] <xx> should have done it a decade ago, but better late than never I guess
[19:21:32] <ordex> xx: correct about 2.6
[19:22:29] <xx> looks like I'll have yet another fight with debian maintainer about getting them to backport 2.6 into stable
[19:23:49] <ordex> :)
[19:24:00] <ordex> maybe these security aspects will be motivating
[19:24:11] <wedwards> xx: Just use backports for EVERYTHING :P
[19:44:15] <xx> ordex: the wording on https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/master/doc/man-sections/cipher-negotiation.rst#openvpn-25-and-later-behaviour, is weird
[19:44:24] <xx> "OpenVPN 2.5 and later will only allow the ciphers specified in --data-ciphers"
[19:44:29] <ordex> xx: that can be :D
[19:44:30] <xx> "If --data-ciphers is not set the default is AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM"
[19:44:45] <xx> it makes it sound like BF-CBC will not be used on 2.5 unless specified
[19:44:53] * ordex reads
[19:45:40] <BtbN> You don't want to use CBS ciphers anymore anyway, so that's a good thing in my book
[19:46:11] <ordex> xx: I think the paragraph is talking about what is allowed in the negotiation
[19:46:27] <ordex> i.e. only ciphers specified in --data-ciphers are allowed to be picked by the negotiation
[19:46:43] <ordex> because this entire chapter is about the negotiation
[19:47:29] <ordex> but the latest paragraph is indeed saying something else
[19:47:40] <ordex> plaisthos: is this entirely correct: https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/master/doc/man-sections/cipher-negotiation.rst#blowfish-in-cbc-mode-bf-cbc-deprecation ?
[19:48:00] <ordex> doesn't OpenVPN *2.5* use BF-CBC as default if NCP is disabled?
[19:49:08] <ordex> because this is saying something else https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/master/src/openvpn/options.c#L3123
[19:50:11] <ordex> xx: IIRC BF-CBC was supposed to be removed as default in 2.5, but something went wrong
[19:50:23] <ordex> so the man-section may still carry the old information
[19:50:32] <ordex> carries*
[19:50:35] <xx> what a mess, but I thankfully configure stuff well (hopefully)

[19:50:59] <ordex> xx: yeah, dealing with this legacy has been really troublesome
[19:51:08] <ordex> 2.6 is supposed to be a more clear cut
[19:51:21] <ordex> the problem is always "avoid breaking existing configurations"
[19:56:54] <plaisthos> ordex: no
[19:57:12] <plaisthos> ordex: 2.5 will disallow if no --cipher is present in the config
[19:57:20] <ordex> hm
[19:57:25] <plaisthos> if you have --cipher BF-CBC in the ocnfig it will still allow it
[19:57:31] <xx> what.a.mess
[19:57:37] <ordex> then what about the message here: https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/master/src/openvpn/options.c#L3123 ?
[19:57:37] <xx> looking forward to 2.6
[19:58:09] <plaisthos> ordex: that says the same, right?
[19:58:28] <plaisthos> no --ciher in config, you won't get BF-CBC unless you add it as --cipher or add it to data-ciphers
[19:58:42] <ordex> this is a message in 2.6
[19:58:55] <plaisthos> oh
[19:59:03] <plaisthos> then that message needs to adjusted/removed
[19:59:19] <ordex> well, you changed it between 2.5 and 2.6
[19:59:24] <ordex> hence my recall that something went wrong
[19:59:45] <ordex> in 2.5, it didn't mention any version. in 2.6 you added "before 2.6"
[19:59:46] <plaisthos> ah misread the message
[19:59:51] <plaisthos> no the message is actually correct

[20:00:27] <ordex> the message says that 2.5, without NCP, will use BF-CBC by default, no?

[20:13:34] <plaisthos> Ah that part is wrong
[20:13:41] <plaisthos> it should be before 2.5 
[20:14:10] <ordex> will triple check and send a patch, if you are fine
[20:15:02] <plaisthos> sure!
[20:15:22] <plaisthos> If we keep this message we probably should make it more generic
[20:15:38] <plaisthos> like if --cipher NOT in --data-ciphers, say we do not fallback to --cipher anymore
[20:17:54] <xx> ordex: so my original statement "don't you mean <2.5?" is true or false?
[20:19:00] <plaisthos> xx: that is true
[20:19:18] <plaisthos> but 2.6 always ignroes --cipher
[20:19:26] <plaisthos> 2.5 only ignored --cipher when not explicitly set
[20:19:51] <plaisthos> and I am saying that if we touch that message, we should also touch the case when you have --cipher BF-CBC or --cipher AES-128-CBC in your config
[20:20:18] <plaisthos> but fixing the message is a good step forwards regardless :)

[20:30:25] <xx> honestly I'd just make the presence of --cipher in 2.6 a breaking error
[20:30:37] <xx> I'd do that for a number of options actually

[20:34:58] <ordex> xx: the problem is that lots of configs out there will just break and people will complain all over the place. so better pave a smooth path forward
[20:35:08] <ordex> that moves them away from bad defaults, without much hassle
[20:35:34] <xx> people will always find something to complain about
[20:36:01] <xx> call it openvpn4 and put it in red and bold "BREAKING CHANGES! READ THE RELEASE NOTES!"
[20:36:03] <ordex> hehe, right, better not give them more reasons to do so :p
[20:43:48] <plaisthos> xx: it is only nice to have a config that works from Openvpn 2.0 to 2.6 without change
