[00:03:09] <Botje> hmm, no.
[00:03:22] <Botje> but I _did_ learn about O_PATH and O_TMPFILE so yay me
[00:03:46] <jpmh> Botje: I'm thinking that it merely needs to be better docmented.  We all understand the ossue now but it is a bear trap - - I've been writing perl for a VERY long time - since perl 4 and it caught me - and I would not say that anyone here was REALLY QUICK at explaining it either
[00:04:30] <jpmh> I'm just writing my own contructor that is a wrapper to Tie::File 
[00:04:46] <Botje> I was banging my head against the desk trying to explain kafka operators for kubernetes
[00:07:36] <ether> you have to remember that a tied file has a filehandle underneath, and filehandles have "interesting" behaviours across forks
[00:07:50] <Botje> I suspect opening it with O_CLOEXEC is not the solution
[00:07:51] <ether> it's not an opaque abstraction

[01:20:37] <Mandevil> Going to reinstall home server very soon -- not sure if I should use Debian or Ubuntu.
[01:20:53] <Mandevil> Have always been using Ubuntu Server.
[01:21:01] <El_Che> I use Ubuntu as well
[01:21:23] <Mandevil> It seems to have some bloat.
[01:21:24] <simcop2387> either should be fine, i use debian myself
[01:21:34] <Mandevil> Debian is more vanilla
[01:21:41] <El_Che> Mandevil: the server version? not much
[01:21:47] <El_Che> just remove snapd :)
[01:21:53] <Mandevil> Oh yes, I hate that.
[01:22:24] <Mandevil> I recently installed Debian on two company servers.
[01:22:29] <Mandevil> Seems pretty nice to me.
[01:22:55] <El_Che> the LTS every 2 years of ubuntu is hard to beat
[01:22:56] <Mandevil> (BTW, completely remote install with Dell iDRAC)
[01:23:26] <El_Che> but in these container days it matter less
[01:23:50] <Mandevil> Containers are not perticularly interesting at home, are they?
[01:24:04] <El_Che> I use them at home as well
[01:24:04] <Mandevil> s/per/par/
[01:24:17] <El_Che> makes your reinstall plans trivial
[01:24:26] <El_Che> and stuff, well, contained
[01:24:38] <Mandevil> Sigh, I should learn docker
[01:25:06] <El_Che> I have the unifi controller in a container, eg
[01:25:21] <simcop2387> alright, i can't seem to get an ovh account made at all, they're not sending me the code to verify my email
[01:25:34] <El_Che> my torrent daemon, my ssh jump host, pihole, etc etc
[01:25:53] <Mandevil> Everything containerized?
[01:25:59] <Mandevil> By yourself?
[01:26:03] <El_Che> as much as I can
[01:26:10] <El_Che> what makes sense
[01:26:25] <Mandevil> I still don't fully understand docker.
[01:26:32] <simcop2387> Mandevil: i'd suggest learning how to use docker-compose or similar tools right from the get-go.  it can make a big difference in how easy it is to manage or move things
[01:26:34] <El_Che> e.g. zfs snapshotting is done on the host
[01:26:36] <Mandevil> Esp. how you handle permanent data.
[01:26:41] <El_Che> backups and so on
[01:27:17] <El_Che> Mandevil: some images are really simple and consist of a dockerfile of 10 lines and a docker-composte of maybe 8
[01:27:43] <El_Che> some are official upstream images wrapped in my own image to control image updates
[01:27:52] <Mandevil> How hard to dockerize my Mojo app?
[01:28:02] <El_Che> it should be trivial
[01:28:09] <Mandevil> But how do you handle the data?
[01:28:25] <El_Che> volumes, aka bindmounting
[01:28:48] <Mandevil> So you have some dir on the host system that is available inside the container?
[01:28:54] <simcop2387> Mandevil: you tell docker "make this directory look like /data (or whatever) inside the container".  then the data lives outside the container and you can back it up like normal
[01:28:55] <El_Che> /opt/docker/transmissiondaemon/rw => rw
[01:29:08] <simcop2387> you can also just make a named volume and let docker manage it, but i really don't like that
[01:29:09] <El_Che>  /rw
[01:30:10] <El_Che> cat Dockerfile docker-compose.yml |wc -l 
[01:30:11] <Mandevil> So when I dockerize something, I carry only the Dockerfile?
[01:30:12] <El_Che> 24
[01:30:15] *** Quits: magla (~gelignite@55d43df6.access.ecotel.net) (Quit: Stay safe!)
[01:30:17] <El_Che> that's it
[01:30:44] <El_Che> Mandevil: if you use upstream images you don't even need that
[01:30:58] <Mandevil> El_Che: ?
[01:31:06] <El_Che> Mandevil: I am security conscious, so I mostly build the image myself
[01:31:09] <Mandevil> El_Che: I don't even need dockerfile?
[01:31:13] <El_Che> no
[01:31:32] <El_Che> in docker-compose.yaml you can reference an upstream image
[01:31:42] <El_Che> and use it as is
[01:31:56] <Mandevil> How big are docker images typically?
[01:32:03] <El_Che> (for you own app, you need a Dockerfile)
[01:32:06] <El_Che> it depends
[01:32:15] <Mandevil> Something to run perl env inside?
[01:32:34] <El_Che> from 10-20 meg for a go on alpine, to a half a gig for a huge java project
[01:32:49] <El_Che> but, docker implements caching of image layers
[01:33:10] <El_Che> so if all your images are running the same ubuntu image they pay the price only once
[01:33:25] <Mandevil> BTW, what does have lxd do with docker?
[01:33:28] <El_Che> if you want small: alpine linux
[01:33:40] <Mandevil> I have this lxd thing in Ubuntu and it's just taking up space for me.
[01:33:53] <Mandevil> I heard about alpine
[01:33:57] <El_Che> Mandevil: it's a different container approach, conceptually closer to a vm
[01:34:20] <El_Che> at work I run Radiator (perl RADIUS server) on containerized Ubuntu
[01:34:24] <El_Che> zero trouble
[01:34:25] <Mandevil> So what I am installing on my Linux to support docker containers?
[01:34:55] <El_Che> Mandevil: docker.io
[01:35:09] <Mandevil> From distro packages?
[01:35:14] <El_Che> sudo apt-get install docker.io docker-compose

[02:50:31] <ilmari> buZz: normally it's perfectly fine, starting at >200Mb/s and then gradually being throttled to ~160
[02:50:43] <xenu> speaking of mst, it's weird he's left libera a few weeks ago and never returned
[02:50:59] <ilmari> I can't be arsed to get off the sofa, dig through the cables box and trek over to the other side of the room to plug it in
[02:51:00] <buZz> ilmari: then someone turns on a microwave or a door motion sensor and all wifi drops

[04:29:59] <aquanight> simcop2387: yeah I mean it seemed alright to run strawberry perl and git yesterday
[04:30:02] <Grinnz> yeah it was... inefficient for a java app
[04:30:22] <aquanight> not enough people seem to even know ARM64 windows exists
[04:30:38] <aquanight> so any time something wants to shove 64-bit in my face on it I've always had to second-guess
[04:30:47] <aquanight> at least I don't have to do that anymore.
[04:33:32] <aquanight> but I probably still can't run minecraft on the damn thing
[04:33:42] <simcop2387> it's gotten a decent amount better, at least as long as you don't mod it like skyrim
[04:33:42] <aquanight> because fecking java.
[04:34:06] <aquanight> but granted I haven't tried
[04:34:21] <aquanight> but java is already awful on x64. I can only imagine it being worse with x64-on-ARM
[04:34:27] <simcop2387> aquanight: yea i've been slowly trying to get strawberry built for arm64 windows, main issue is that cygwin doesn't support it.
[04:34:37] <aquanight> fuck cygwin
[04:34:45] <simcop2387> cygwin is needed for SP though
[04:34:48] <aquanight> for what
[04:35:06] <simcop2387> SP is built on top of MSYS2 which is built on top of cygwin
[04:35:12] <aquanight> wtf is SP
[04:35:18] <simcop2387> strawberry perl
[04:35:24] <aquanight> okay
[04:35:28] <aquanight> why can't we build it full-native
[04:35:40] <simcop2387> because cygwin doesn't support arm64 windows
[04:35:46] <aquanight> again fuck cygwin
[04:35:58] <aquanight> AKA I'm talking about targeting MSVC or whatever the fuck we need to
[04:36:04] <simcop2387> it's needed for providing APIs and wrappers for strawberry perl
[04:36:41] <aquanight> hmm
[04:37:00] <simcop2387> and MSVC isn't redistributable either
[04:37:03] <aquanight> now I wonder what APIs can't be internalized so we can ditch cygwin for strawberry
[04:37:37] <aquanight> wait what
[04:37:45] <aquanight> doesn't MSVC have redist packages
[04:37:55] <simcop2387> for the c library yes, not the compiler
[04:37:58] <aquanight> and I'm pretty sure they count as "part of the operating system" if GPL is bitching.
[04:38:05] <aquanight> oh. for cpan.
[04:38:23] <simcop2387> and all non-cpan modules that users want to install
[04:38:30] <aquanight> yeah that part sucks ass.
[04:38:41] <aquanight> then again
[04:38:51] <aquanight> don't we sometimes have that problem on linux systems?
[04:39:00] <aquanight> cpan doesn't just ship a gcc compiler
[04:39:24] <simcop2387> that they don't have a compiler? yea you tell people to go install the compiler.  telling people to go buy visual studio to use perl will be a non-starter
[04:39:25] <aquanight> e.g. on debian/ubuntu you have to do apt install build-essentials and such yourself
[04:39:36] <aquanight> you don't need to buy vstudio
[04:39:40] <aquanight> there's an SDK

[04:44:00] <aquanight> daemon: so you can run a linux build of perl
[04:44:03] <daemon> yes
[04:44:06] <aquanight> daemon: we're talking about strawberry
[04:44:07] <ilmari> wsl2 is basically a hypervisor that runs linux
[04:44:12] <aquanight> daemon: aka windows native perl
[04:44:23] <aquanight> daemon: which currently has to rely on cygwin
[04:44:24] <daemon> oh right, for that you need mingw32
[04:44:34] <aquanight> daemon: so is really little better than WSL'd perl
[04:44:46] <ilmari> daemon: or msvc
[04:44:48] <xenu> windows perl doesn't rely on cygwin
[04:44:49] <daemon> yep
[04:44:58] <aquanight> 18:05:09/C0EA6 < simcop2387> SP is built on top of MSYS2 which is built on top of cygwin
[04:45:15] <xenu> strawberry perl needs msys2 to build some stuff
[04:45:24] <xenu> but in general it's possible to build perl with mingw without cygwin

[04:45:41] <xenu> either way, strawberry doesn't ship with cygwin or msys
[04:45:43] <aquanight> still relying on a posix emulation
[04:46:20] <xenu> (also, msys is a fork of cygwin, so you can't say it relies on it)
[04:46:39] <aquanight> the point is
[04:46:42] <xenu> aquanight: only for building
[04:46:46] <aquanight> one of those things is lacking arm64 support
[04:46:53] <aquanight> so because of it we don't have arm64 strawberry
[04:46:56] <xenu> no
[04:47:04] <xenu> we don't have arm64 strawberry because no one bothered to do it
[04:47:05] <xenu> hell
[04:47:13] <xenu> we don't even have 5.34 x64 strawberry
[04:47:14] <aquanight> I think simcop2387 was trying to do it
[04:47:31] <aquanight> and said exactly this was the problem
[04:47:37] <aquanight> that mingw/cygwin aren't supporting arm64
[04:48:24] *** Joins: cfr (~cfr@ip-109-43-113-0.web.vodafone.de)
[04:48:46] <aquanight> and I suppose if it were me and the problem with supporting arm64 was a lack of support from a posix emulation layer, my first thought would be "rip out the posix emulation layer"
[04:48:53] <xenu> ah, i meant we don't have arm64 windows perl*
[04:49:01] <xenu> strawberry with its msys dependency may be indeed problematic
[04:49:12] <xenu> but building perl for arm64 with msvc should be doable
[04:49:15] <aquanight> and I doubt activestate's build is any better off

[04:49:36] <xenu> perl doesn't need posix emulation layer
[04:49:52] <aquanight> the real problem is CPAN
[04:49:53] <xenu> that msys stuff is only  for building some of the dependencies

[04:50:05] <daemon> I am not sure its even a problem at all
[04:50:07] <aquanight> for a distribution, a fully native perl is using MS VC compiler
[04:50:18] <daemon> is there even any utility for it or demand for it right now?
[04:50:27] <xenu> perl can't be built with clang on windows, but that's fixable too
[04:50:37] <xenu> again, a few tweaks in the makefile
[04:51:00] <aquanight> but you can't just ask people to just install a MSVC compiler
[04:51:11] <aquanight> because now they have to install vstudio community at the very least
[04:51:15] <aquanight> because MS is asshoe
[04:51:30] <ilmari> the point of strawberry perl is to have an out-of-the-box complete cpan-capable unix-like experience

[04:54:17] <daemon> its not like it is massively impossible, its just the amount of people it would benefit is so minimal as to be on par with the amiga port
[04:54:27] <xenu> until win 2008 also on itanium and it seems someone at some point tried building perl for that

[05:00:39] <aquanight> daemon: long story short, at one point I wanted to be able to log in to a minecraft world I was working on remotely using the arm64 tablet. Except getting even java to run was a fucking nightmare.
[05:00:53] <aquanight> Because of course the logical thing to do to get java on Windows is to go to oracle.
[05:01:02] <aquanight> x86 and x64 builds, naturally.
[05:01:16] <aquanight> and of course they try to shove you the x64 build. Which doesn't work on arm64.
[05:01:26] <daemon> aquanight, try logging into a switch that requires java and ie6 for its management interface - java is the most evil 'compatible' platform ever devised
[05:01:31] <aquanight> so finagle it to get an x86 build. Fine.
[05:01:33] <aquanight> Except.
[05:01:42] <aquanight> the W10 x86 opengl implementation sucked donkey ass

[05:22:26] <aquanight> but honestly at this point
[05:22:45] <aquanight> I think MS should put out a forced update for all Windows builds that are out of support: update or we delete ndis.sys

[06:01:46] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ SoftPC - Wikipedia ]
[06:01:56] <xenu> >When Microsoft released Windows NT it included a subsystem ("WOW" - Windows on Windows, later NTVDM) for running virtualized 16-bit Windows (x86) programs. However, they had also made changes to Windows to allow it to run on alternative processors (Alpha, PowerPC), and for these an emulation layer was needed for programs compiled for Intel processors. Customized versions of Insignia's core emulation system 
[06:02:02] <xenu> were produced to this end, but the alternative NT architectures never became widely used.

[06:03:47] <daemon> before AMD64
[06:03:54] <xenu> windows 2008 was the last one to work on that architecture
[06:04:07] <xenu> (and xp was the only non-server OS to support it)

[06:04:26] <daemon> I always fancy picking one up just to have one to sit next to the amiga, spectrum and sun
[06:04:30] <daemon> but there pretty damn pricey
[06:04:31] <daemon> even now
[06:04:57] <xenu> only HP's itanium machines are worth having, they can run hp-ux, windows and openvms
[06:05:07] <xenu> other vendors are pretty much limited only to linux
[06:05:07] <daemon> and freebsd! :)
[06:05:10] <gordonfish> xenu: Yeah there were two 64-bit XP versions and it was pretty confusing then.
[06:05:28] <daemon> netbsd would surely run too

[06:25:22] <rbraun> agreed on this, generally
[06:25:36] <rbraun> IMO amazon's online marketplace should be forced to be separated from its entire physical logistics/delivery/warehousing ops
[06:25:42] <daemon> yeah they really do like hitting into others markets >.>
[06:25:56] <rbraun> apple should be forced to allow competing app stores
[06:26:02] <rbraun> google should have to divest chrome and maybe android
[06:26:14] <rbraun> facebook just needs to be hit upside the head with privacy and data portability laws first
[06:26:22] <daemon> facebook is still a thing?
[06:26:28] <rbraun> i support severe antitrust remedies but they have to make sense
[06:26:33] <rbraun> e.g. fuck all the whining about section 230
[06:26:38] <rbraun> section 230 is good

[06:27:31] <rbraun> or google to own doubleclick...
[06:28:10] <rbraun> but i think chrome is the biggest problem with google right now, they can rig the whole web to work for them and nobody else
[06:28:13] <rbraun> and the state AGs seem to agree
[06:28:35] <rbraun> the amazon remedy i want may be the harshest tho, but i think it's necessary
[06:29:27] <daemon> it has to come
[06:29:53] <rbraun> yeah
[06:30:14] <daemon> they will hit a monopoly ruling somewhere and get torpedo'd
[06:30:23] <rbraun> one can only hope
[06:30:42] <rbraun> interestingly, since their monopoly depends heavily on physical infra, there is an opportunity to see what happens once they do
[06:30:54] <rbraun> even if it's just in one part of the world
[06:31:40] <daemon> AWS, Azure, Rackspace ... massively overpriced, oversold resource sellers
[06:31:47] <daemon> what happened to people deploying their own servers
[06:31:56] <daemon> cloud hosting is not cheaper
[06:32:17] <rbraun> at scale, sure
[06:32:26] <daemon> even at scale I doubt it is
[06:32:33] <rbraun> no, i mean at scale it is not
[06:32:39] <daemon> yep
[06:32:51] <rbraun> tho you need modern software and people to manage it
[06:32:57] <Grinnz> splitting up amazon will mostly hurt because we've been building our society around cheaper goods so we can underpay workers and defund social services. something has to give
[06:32:58] <daemon> because you could always resell your overpurchased resources you own at cheap on the basis its not always availible
[06:33:10] <rbraun> also depends on what you put on it; e.g. google's infamous internal "5gb" presentation
[06:33:13] <rbraun> er, "5tb"
[06:33:24] <rbraun> "i just want to serve 5tb of data" turned out to be a hard use case for google cloud

[13:26:32] <hudo> got a strange behaviour, installed on a fresh win10 strawberry-perl and started on console a perl-programm running for years, and the prog break of without a comment. Any ideas ?
[13:28:25] <lopid> the program had been running for years, in a freshly installed os?
[13:28:58] <hudo> I started the programm initially which demanded then mdoule after module, which I installed. After the last modules installation the prog started, and ended whithout comment as if the perl-prog was empty
[13:29:32] <lopid> what was it supposed to do?
[13:31:57] <hudo> lopid, yes the perl-programme is running on many pc for years, indeed a exe created from the perl-programm is used. The exe has the same behaviour on the fresh installation. To ban some exe effects i installed strawberryx on this pc to run the perl prog
[13:32:40] <lopid> was it not successful?
[13:33:04] <hudo> starting the exe mentioned in windows error log a problem with libeay32__.dll  
[13:33:42] <hudo> in the prog i use Crypt::Tea_JS and arybase;
[13:33:44] <lopid> Net::SSLeay comes to mind, but that might be way off
[13:33:51] <hudo> lopid , no it was 
[13:34:07] <hudo> not successfull running the perl progs, as mentioned above

[13:50:32] <buZz> hudo: i suspect you are running the .exe you made in 2014 with ancient libraries, instead of the perl version in your newly installed interpreter
[13:50:43] <hudo> buZz, how do you see , that its from 2014 ? indeed, the file has a timestamp from 20150126 , so yes it is rather old

[14:07:37] <Altreus> rindolf: I would usually prefer use lines to be at the top, for reasons I'm sure I can justify if I thought about it long enough
[14:08:11] <Altreus> instinctively it feels bad to introduce something halfway down - I suppose my objection would be that, if you see something used in a file, you should be able to use it anywhere in the file

[20:19:03] <jaytee80> Oh, and it's owned by oracle... so when that happened I knew the ship was sailing.
[20:19:42] <mjgardner> Yah, Log4perl doesn't do JNDI (it's based on Log4j 1.x and the offending feature was added in 2.x) and won't interpolate or execute logged data unless you do something like add your own code to do it. It does have a facility for embedding arbitrary Perl code in your configuration for things like filters and custom placeholders, but nothing that's driven by user-supplied data. (And you can limit that facility to only allow specific 
[20:19:42] <mjgardner> Perl opcodes and variables inside of Safe compartments for maximum paranoia.)

[20:50:19] <Altreus> LeoNerd: ^
[20:50:28] <Mandevil> Yesterday there were 11, but few days I had 26.
[20:50:56] <LeoNerd> Hmmmmright
[20:52:11] <ilmari> «allows Java software clients to discover and look up data and resources (in the form of Java objects) via a name» - it supports many data sources, one of which is ldap. and that can return both a bunch of serialised java objcets, as well as pointers to where to find the implementation of the classes of those objects
[20:52:49] <Altreus> no warnings 'exciting'; # Warning: fun detected
[20:53:29] <ilmari> the latter part changed from enabled to disabled by default in a recetnt(ish) java update, but the serialised objects could still use any classes already in the application's local class path as gadgets for exploitation
[20:54:18] <v`> "Pro move: find out if there is a ring in your or her family. My MIL asked when me and the wife were getting married and she said that we were waiting to afford a ring. Literally the next day, MIL dropped off her mother's ring."
[20:54:35] <mjgardner> I guess it can be used for things like DNS too? It reminds me of people who want to use SQL for everything, e.g., DBD::foo
[20:54:41] <El_Che> not ldap only
[20:54:52] <ilmari> LeoNerd: https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-the-log4j2-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228/ looks like a good summary

[20:54:58] <El_Che> you can retrieve java classes fron different sources
[20:55:00] <LeoNerd> Ooohright, so it's sortof like allowing Storable to thaw things via LDAP lookups, including `require`ing modules off remote sources, by injecting logging strings
