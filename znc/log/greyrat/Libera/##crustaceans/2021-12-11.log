[00:12:39] <companion_cube> wait, what's going on ngoldbaum?
[00:13:08] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: the java vulnerability
[00:13:11] <companion_cube> (talking about data breachs, seems like someone tried to usurp my credit card this very morning)
[00:13:13] <companion_cube> oh, right.
[00:15:23] <manicennui> Hmm. AMC has a new Anne Boleyn series and the titular character is played by a black woman.
[00:16:00] <manicennui> Wonder whether it is any good.
[00:16:21] <manicennui> Also, how many different shows and movies do we have about her?
[00:19:00] <manicennui> From the WSJ: "Jodie Turner-Smith stars as the ill-fated queen in AMC+’s new series that hints at the contemporary drama surrounding Meghan Markle."
[00:19:02] <manicennui> Really?
[00:19:17] <manicennui> Does it actually, or is the WSJ projecting?
[00:19:43] <manicennui> Meghan Markle is nothing like Anne Boleyn.
[00:21:18] <manicennui> Their reasoning seems to be that the actress playing Anne is black and the actor playing Henry looks like Prince Harry.
[00:46:12] <gwozniak> Someone internal sent out numbers saying our compiler had terrible code size (over 100% bigger than a competitor), so we analyze it and the app they used to show the number aren't the same for the two compilers
[00:46:29] <gwozniak> A file containing a huge data object was left out of the competitor's build
[00:46:49] <gwozniak> Thanks, some person, who decided to escalate that
[00:47:46] <gwozniak> I'm guessing they didn't run it to see if it actually worked
[00:48:14] <manicennui> Geeks are annoying.
[00:48:41] <manicennui> Just focus on getting shit done nerds.
[00:48:45] <manicennui> Stop annoying people.
[00:49:25] <gwozniak> The pressure is on now because all the internal teams have been told to use our compiler instead of any competitors (to keep licensing costs down).  I think some people are resentful that they have to switch
[00:51:06] <indigo> For some reason I thought your company just built compilers
[00:51:46] <manicennui> Rumor is they also build YUGE binaries!
[00:52:30] <indigo> The biggest binaries
[00:53:50] <gwozniak> Biggest ELFs you'll find anywhere!
[00:54:33] <gerikson> I got your huge binary RIGHT HERE
[00:55:24] <gwozniak> I will say that in the embedded world there are many compiler options, and they each have their own extensions, so switching can be a pain
[00:55:41] <gwozniak> Some add their own keywords and such

[00:57:09] <manicennui> I love how weird it is
[00:57:42] <manicennui> I missed the first part. Why are all of the grandparents in bed?
[00:59:04] <gwozniak> I think it's because they are old and/or sick
[00:59:20] <gwozniak> I asked my wife, who has taught the book multiple times
[00:59:31] <manicennui> I guess this one is actually called Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
[00:59:46] <gwozniak> And shows the remake, because the kids don't get the old one
[01:09:45] <manicennui> I've never seen the new one. I'm not a big Johnny Depp fan.
[01:09:57] <manicennui> And I figure there is no way they did a good job regardless.
[01:12:52] <manicennui> "After he finished shooting Willy Wonka, the then 13-year-old Ostrum[8] declined David L. Wolper's offer of a three-film contract."
[01:13:00] <manicennui> He became a vet.

[01:30:31] <gwozniak> Plus the kids don't like old movies, apparently
[01:31:48] <gwozniak> She says she's shown older movies and the kids are distracted by the fact its old (it looks different, etc.)
[01:32:09] <manicennui> heh
[01:32:38] <manicennui> The key is to never show them new movies. Raise them completely on old media.
[01:33:50] <manicennui> Like M. Night Shyamalan's The Village, but make it a 1980's village.
[01:35:26] <gwozniak> Only show 80s action movies. The direct to VHS kind

[01:48:55] <manicennui> I'm watching this on AMC+'s AMC live stream, which means there are commercials.
[01:48:59] <manicennui> OMG
[01:49:10] <manicennui> This shit is pure poison.
[01:49:19] <manicennui> No wonder Americans are so fucked up.
[01:50:59] <manicennui> About half the commercials are for prescription drugs or questionable financial products.
[01:51:26] <manicennui> Another chunk are for highly processed food.

[04:32:18] <imode> I wasn't even aware of it. at all. how did this make it _into_ log4j to begin with. in what world do I want a _log message_ to influence _class loading_.
[04:33:34] <imode> it seems like something maliciously committed under the guise of functionality, but _there are no usecases_.

[05:11:59] <defect> i mean, it is a plugin system :) but yeah, probably should have been reviewed a lot more thoroughly before shipping it bundled with log4j

[05:36:23] <jlindgren> i wrote a blockchain (happy gasps) in java (sighs)
[05:39:48] <imode> so apparently someone wrote an innocuous JNDI resolver/loader and because of Log4j's eagerly interpolated strings, you can invoke that.
[05:39:54] <imode> grumble grumble.

[16:33:20] <river> one possible benefit of decoupling GUIs from applications is that you can actually keep the same UI around
[16:33:28] <river> I don't like it when programs randomly change the UI
[16:33:48] <river> also, there can be 3rd party alternative GUIs for the same command line program
[16:39:52] <companion_cube> river: wait, what
[16:40:04] <river> ?
[16:40:27] <companion_cube> Web apps are just inferior to GUIs in most cases : slower, not configurable, hungrier in resources
[16:40:34] <companion_cube> Why would you want only webapps?
[16:40:54] <river> hungrier in resources <-- that's a big negative, but maybe it could be fixed
[16:43:22] <river> there are these PWAs now, that lets you 'save' a webpage as a desktop program
[16:43:49] <river> i wonder how much of the inefficiency of webapps is bad programming
[16:46:14] <ngoldbaum> javascript engines are just resource hungry
[16:46:23] <ngoldbaum> like the JVM they trade memory bloat for speed
[16:46:51] <river> ah
[16:47:04] <river> does webasm help at all?
[16:47:36] <companion_cube> A browser is hungry, js is hungry

[16:47:47] <river> omg
[16:47:48] <companion_cube> There's little chance it'll be as lean as a gtk or Qt app
[16:48:26] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: it's also hard to make js go fast, the js engines are marvels of engineering
[16:48:51] <ngoldbaum> yeah js has tons of performance cliffs
[16:48:57] <ngoldbaum> not that C/C++ don’t
[16:52:44] <river> I wonder if they could redesign HTML and stuff, so that it can compete with native GUI apps in terms of efficiency
[16:53:19] <river> is it because it's so dynamic that it's more resource hungry?
[16:54:01] <Brekkjern> v.v.v
[16:54:01] <buttsbot> (‿.ꜟ‿) (￣ε (#￣)
[16:55:13] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: yeah but C++'s start from a few order of magnitude below
[16:56:23] <companion_cube> river: there's a ton of stuff in a browser, and you have the dom, an API exposed from it to an interpreted dynamic language, with a lot of textual bits in the API
[16:56:35] <river> I implemented an efficient algorithm in rust for one of the AOC problems, and someone else wrote the same alg in nim - but mine is 10x slower
[16:56:40] <river> I literally cannot figure out why
[16:56:55] <companion_cube> Did you use --release?
[16:56:58] <river> it's bothering me
[16:57:08] <river> I would to double check that I was measuring the release, good question..
[16:57:12] <river> would have to*
[16:57:26] <companion_cube> Is nim using gcc or clang? :)
[16:58:05] <river> hmm nim goes via C ? so i guess it could be either, ill try building his code to run in my own machine
[16:58:08] <river> I love having a dom available
[16:58:19] <river> it's amazing to be able to uniquely address every GUI element
[16:58:31] <river> or to use the inspector and be able to see 'what is this in terms of the code'
[16:58:38] <river> you dont realize how valuable this is until you don't have it
[16:59:39] <river> yeah maybe the text aspect is a big problem
[16:59:43] <river> how js is all text based
[16:59:51] <river> i should look into efficiency of wasm
[17:01:14] <river> oh neat there's something called assemblyscript, that compiles typescript to wasm
[17:01:20] <companion_cube> I mean look at event handlers
[17:01:31] <companion_cube> You literally give a string for the name of the event
[17:01:47] <companion_cube> You can set any dom node by setting its html text (!)
[17:02:14] <river> https://medium.com/@torch2424/webassembly-is-fast-a-real-world-benchmark-of-webassembly-vs-es6-d85a23f8e193 yikes....
[17:02:25] <river> 1.6x faster in chrome, 11.71x faster in firefox
[17:02:32] <river> I don't know what to make of that
[17:02:43] <river> yeah
[17:02:52] <river> those are efficiency design errors
[17:03:02] <river> so you probaby would need to rejig HTML/dom api a bit
[17:03:27] <river> but that's do-able I think, back compatability doesn't matter when nothing works a week later due to bitrot anyway
[17:16:36] <companion_cube> quite the opposite, no? browsers are super backward compatible
[17:16:44] <companion_cube> if we could break compat for JS it'd improve, for sure
[17:17:08] <epilys> browsers are a tower of standards stacked together
[17:20:51] <river> even with the problems of browsers, I believe in the model
[17:27:23] <companion_cube> alas it makes sense
[17:27:30] <companion_cube> but I want to keep GUIs where i can
[17:27:39] <companion_cube> like, I want my pdf viewer to be fast and lean, as much as possible
[17:27:51] <river> yeah that's true actually, the PDF viewer in browser is pretty bad
[17:28:24] <river> I got my native one configured to use creme/off white for the background now, it's so nice
[17:28:25] <ngoldbaum> wow the quad-state tornado lofted debris to 35,000 ft
[17:28:55] <ngoldbaum> imagine getting sucked into a tornado and asphyxiating because you’re in an updraft at the altitude of the summit of everest
[17:29:18] <river> where do I sign up
[17:29:37] <companion_cube> does it lift things as heavy as people? :s
[17:29:40] <companion_cube> damn
[17:32:29] <epilys> there was a person who experienced that and survived

[21:04:46] <Brekkjern> Anyone willing to bet how long it will take before the workers are blamed for not thinking about their own safety?
[21:09:35] <imode> destroy amazon.
[21:11:40] <Geekingfrog> but but but, my next day delivery with free shipping !
[21:14:42] <imode> destroy it harder.
[21:15:11] <Geekingfrog> :D
[21:20:15] <imode> is teamseas legit.
[21:22:06] <mouseghost> no idea
[21:22:34] <imode> this teamtrees and teamseas shit just seems like donation pandering for youtube celebrities.
[21:24:06] <imode> is there any evidence they're actually doing anything other than pocketing the money and running.
[21:47:30] <mouseghost> hm
[21:48:49] <mouseghost> imode, i think they might actually plant it -- just like there are co2 offsetting businesses; ie they get money and they pay to different initiatives that are not managed by them
[21:49:19] <mouseghost> at least theoretically
[21:49:29] <mouseghost> i wonder if, and how much, premium they take
[21:50:01] <mouseghost> regardless, it has already been shown that theres a shitload of cash in various charity institutions; it just comes down to the management...

[22:55:51] <epilys> haha
[22:56:19] <epilys> that's like the priests here in greece saying "yeah vaccines work; but dying of covid makes you a martyr and you want that"
[22:57:47] *** Joins: ben (ben@libera/staff/ben)
[22:58:21] <dimadima> epilys: you've got that going in Greece?
[22:58:30] <epilys> some priests, not all
[22:58:49] <epilys> there's fragmentation in the greek orthodox church
[22:59:04] <dimadima> why do they think dying from covid is better than getting the vaccine?
[22:59:28] <ngoldbaum> gives you a primo spot in heaven
[23:01:06] <martian67> epilys:  thats certainly an innovative take
[23:03:24] <manicennui> I'm all for those clowns killing themselves, but not not getting vaccinated and not taking basic precautions increases the risks for everyone.
[23:03:28] <manicennui> So fuck them.
[23:04:07] <dimadima> i really want to hear this explanation
[23:04:32] <manicennui> Are you expecting it to be logical?
[23:04:38] <dimadima> i want to know how foregoing the vaccine and dying from covid would make you a martyr
[23:04:41] <dimadima> no
[23:05:04] <dimadima> but it may follow some kind of logic at least within some illogical framework
[23:06:08] <manicennui> All you need to do is examine past martyrs that they celebrate to realize that a large number of them are bullshit too.
[23:06:25] <epilys> it makes you a martyr because covid is the devil's work
[23:06:54] <dimadima> epilys: because why?
[23:07:00] <manicennui> In most cases it just boils down to someone opposing the wrong authority, obeying the right authority (priests/cardinals/popes), and dying.
[23:07:02] <dimadima> because it's put us against each other?
[23:07:15] <manicennui> Very few of them were standing up for anything logical.
[23:07:25] <epilys> dimadima, really looking for a "because why" in religion?
[23:07:32] <dimadima> yes
[23:07:37] <epilys> you're out of luck then
[23:07:50] <dimadima> but there's definitely an answer they'd give
[23:08:07] <epilys> i think it's what I said, "the devil"
[23:08:27] <dimadima> usually these guys make sense within a framework
[23:08:47] <dimadima> like, of their religion. even if it requires some extreme/uncommon interpretation of something
[23:09:06] <dimadima> christianity-as-a-deathcult is interesting
[23:11:43] <martian67> i mean thats true of any logic whatsoever, as long as its consistent
[23:11:59] <martian67> or reasonably so
[23:17:50] <manicennui> dimadima: What part of their nonsense makes sense?
[23:18:39] <manicennui> You might be able to make that argument about Judaism, but not Christianity.
[23:22:15] <martian67> people much smarter than both of us have written extensive volumes about theology and its basis and justifications
[23:22:41] <martian67> its arrogant and stupid to say none of it makes any sense
[23:22:46] <martian67> to an extreme degree
[23:22:52] <manicennui> Yes, yes.
[23:23:29] <manicennui> I'll say it again: Christianity is a mishmash of conflicting nonsense that is as much about politics as anything else.
[23:23:33] <martian67> its not like everyone who beleives this stuff is stupider than you
[23:23:40] <manicennui> You can learn this by reading the volumes you mention.
[23:23:47] <martian67> and you are the intelectual titan gazing over a race of mental midgets
[23:23:51] <martian67> pull your head out of your ass
[23:24:16] <manicennui> Feel free to keep defending them out of some sense of misguided tolerance.
[23:24:53] <river> you're being pretty rude martian67
[23:25:11] <martian67> yeah, so?
[23:25:27] <martian67> write a letter to the civility police
[23:25:49] <river> maybe take 5 mins
[23:25:59] <martian67> i will not be doing that
[23:27:05] <martian67> manicennui:  it has nothing to do with tolerance, maybe even especially so, as if you really dislike what these people do and say, its important to actually understand it if you want to make coherent arguements against it
[23:27:18] <manicennui> I do understand it.
[23:27:26] <manicennui> What there is to understand anyways.
[23:28:00] <manicennui> It's just another example of humans trying to form tribes, hierarchies, and to gain power.
[23:28:02] <martian67> what a silly pair of lines
[23:28:07] <manicennui> Built up over thousands of years.
[23:28:59] <manicennui> When you read about enough of the maneuvering that got them to where they are today, you realize that it is just different tribes trying to exert themselves.
[23:29:09] <manicennui> But it didn't even make sense from the start.
[23:29:37] <manicennui> It was reactionary, they appropriated various things, and used a symbol to build power.
[23:30:48] <martian67> that underlies a lot more than religion, it encompasses basically the entirety of human culture, nor are you exempt from it
[23:31:04] <manicennui> Didn't claim otherwise.
[23:31:25] <manicennui> In fact, I explicitly stated it.
[23:31:28] <manicennui> Try to keep up.
[23:31:31] <martian67> i don't see you rejecting your entire cultural basis out of hand
[23:31:43] <manicennui> What is my cultural basis?
[23:32:01] <manicennui> You won't see me defending American "culture".
[23:32:02] <martian67> it doesn't matter what it is
[23:32:08] <manicennui> Or our system of government.
[23:32:10] <manicennui> Or anything else.
[23:32:33] <manicennui> Just a bunch of humans trying to gain power and wealth.
[23:33:02] <martian67> what a miserable philosophy
[23:33:10] <manicennui> It's not a philosophy.
[23:33:14] <martian67> it is
[23:34:47] <edk> i think religion is distinguished from a lot of other cultural things by claiming to be a moral authority (though, since "muh democracy" is right around the corner, obviously not all)
[23:35:09] <edk> i don't think the fact that it's occupied lots of smart people's time particularly vindicates it
[23:35:43] <martian67> its not about vindicating it, i happen to not believe in that sort of thing at all
[23:35:51] <edk> there's been a lot of history where if you wanted to study something or even just make some art you'd have to connect it to religion somehow
[23:36:09] <edk> and then of course a lot of the sillier arguments were really proxy wars for political conflicts
[23:36:52] <manicennui> Most of Christianity's history is naked politics.
[23:37:04] <manicennui> The Catholic Church was a political instrument.
[23:37:29] <manicennui> Late Roman history is tightly intertwined with Christian history.
[23:37:41] <manicennui> And now you see the same nonsense in the US.
[23:38:14] <kline> software is politics
[23:38:42] <manicennui> It is an advantage to Republicans because their entire party is authoritarian, and what better authority to appeal to than God?
[23:39:05] <manicennui> God sent us Trump and he is doing God's work!
[23:39:08] <manicennui> Don't question him!
[23:39:25] <manicennui> An attack on Trump is an attack on God!
[23:39:27] <edk> i think the republican party is better understood as a coalition of various different kinds of reactionary
[23:40:32] <edk> there is cross-pollination of course, but most of them are probably not really religious fundamentalists, or at least weren't to begin with
[23:42:43] <manicennui> The reactionary positions are adopted to help solidify their influence.
[23:43:13] <manicennui> Then they set themselves up as the only people who can solve the problems.
[23:44:09] <edk> i'm not sure if there's really anything other than reactionaryism in there lately, they're just the party of destroying everything
[23:44:19] <edk> but i mean i agree that it's adopted
[23:45:21] <kline> the institution of the catholic church practicing christianity isnt massively different from google practicing software. both take something that has a mix of good and bad and use their predominant position to lobby external politics and further reshape the thing they practice in ways to suit and solidify their position
[23:45:37] <edk> each thing the republican party hates buys it the support of some faction that hates that specific thing and doesn't care about anything else
[23:45:51] <kline> golang isnt vastly different from catholic doctrinal extensions
[23:46:04] <manicennui> edk: Sure, I don't disagree that those are their tactics.
[23:46:16] <edk> kline: i think that argument sounds cute but doesn't really mean much
[23:46:24] <manicennui> edk: But ultimately they want all of those people to see them as the authority.
[23:46:55] <kline> edk, manicennui just really hates christianity and its fun to draw comparisons
[23:47:23] <kline> i think it falls down only in that yes, christianity does hold a moral position whereas software itself is a completely a-moral tool, adaptable to anything
[23:47:56] <kline> but i do think calling christianity evil because of the catholic church is silly
[23:47:59] <edk> i mean it falls down in several other ways too imo
[23:48:17] <kline> they are just one politically and economically motivated institution
[23:48:56] <kline> they practice and wield christianity, but only in the same way that google wields software as a tool to acheive political and economic aims
[23:49:09] <edk> christianity as distinguished from any specific christian church starts to run into problems with its definitions
[23:49:18] <edk> i think that's nonsense
[23:49:25] <companion_cube> people who like djeezousse
[23:49:32] <kline> thats fine with me, everyone should have their own christianity
[23:49:38] <edk> or none
[23:49:40] <kline> it can be a loose set of principles just fine
[23:49:45] <edk> it's not even a set of principles though
[23:50:19] <kline> i mean, most religions and philosophies broadly say the same thing, just with different stories to back it up
[23:50:23] <edk> the more christians i talk to about what christianity is, the more convinced i am that it's exactly the set of people who consider themselves to be christians
[23:50:57] <edk> it doesn't have any universal, core set of moral principles or propositions about the world or anything else
[23:52:19] <companion_cube> love your neighbor and all that, in theory?
[23:52:45] <edk> you'd hope
[23:52:55] <kline> yeah, generally 1) dont be a dick to your peers, 2) respect authority, 3) bring people into the fold
[23:53:16] <kline> all are pervertable
[23:53:32] <edk> i don't think all christians would agree on the latter two
[23:53:34] <mouseghost> RESPECT MA AUTHORITY
[23:54:03] <edk> and certainly there isn't one of those that they all practise
[23:54:05] <kline> (who are your peers? what about your non-peers? who is authority, and to what extent can they be challenged while respected? what do we do about people we cant convert, etc?)
[23:54:12] <companion_cube> mouseghost: so true
[23:54:52] <kline> edk, all certainly agree with 2, just they have varying extents for authority, but they all expect you to respect god as the source of divine authority at the very least
[23:55:13] <edk> i'm unconvinced
[23:55:17] <kline> some expand authority into that of spiritual leaders, some extend it into civil/secular aspects
[23:56:26] <kline> 3 is a bit of a theft from biology, since religions that dont have strong spreading instincts i guess die out or live only in small niches (think yazidi, etc)
[23:56:29] <manicennui> 1 is only used when Christians need to chastise their enemies.
[23:56:30] <edk> i know christians for whom god is just a source of (imagined, obviously) internal strength
[23:56:38] <manicennui> They are the biggest assholes otherwise.
[23:56:50] <edk> i'm sure you can find a way to batter that into fitting 2 but i don't think there would be any point
[23:57:52] <kline> isnt that internal strength just the Spirit?
[23:58:10] <edk> if you're one of the subset of christians who think it inhabits everyone then maybe
[23:58:29] <kline> catholics would just call them heretics with an overly restrictive understanding but still say thats god anyway
[23:58:32] <edk> but that, yet again, is not something all christians believe, because there isn't a single thing that all christians believe
[23:59:29] <edk> anyway, zooming out of this (imo rather silly) tangent, i don't think software is really any more similar to religion than, say, hammers
