[10:05:27] <serafeim> benwilson512: what i can't realyl understand is why. the JS commands use soem liveview features ? 
[10:06:11] <serafeim> from a quick look it seems that don't use anything liveview specific; these are client js only
[10:09:00] <serafeim> unless i'm missing something
[10:10:55] <Nicd> they depend on the liveview JS and liveview rendering on the backend at least
[10:14:08] <serafeim> depending on the liveview JS i agree. i can't understand `liveview rendering on the backend `
[10:15:56] <Nicd> well for example how do you render `<button phx-click={JS.show(to: "#item", transition: "fade-in-scale")}>`? it evaluates to `<button phx-click={%JS{...}}>` in runtime, how do you render that JS struct to the frontend?
[10:17:49] <Nicd> apparently it converts it to JSON so maybe it can be rendered
[10:18:00] <Nicd> though I don't know about things like `@myself`
[10:18:58] * sekun[m] uploaded an image: (31KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/bzChNUCkDMPCxlSDcZkErCWx/image.png >
[10:19:35] <serafeim> Nicd: i am just thinking that it would be very useful to have this JS.show functionality on all our phoenix views not only when there's a liveview
[10:20:07] <Nicd> I guess if you rip out the LiveView DOM event code from the socket code and use that in your dead views also
[10:20:14] <sekun[m]> looks like all the metadata needed just gets rendered in phx-click, with an attribute called `event="js:exec"`. so liveview js knows how to take care of it without any intervention from the backend
[10:20:17] <Nicd> I don't know how tightly they're coupled
[10:20:35] <Nicd> sekun[m]: yeah should've looked at the code in the first place :P
[10:20:37] <serafeim> sekun[m]: yes i've tested it it doesn't use the backend 
[10:21:38] <sekun[m]> yeah i just checked the livebeats demo here https://livebeats.fly.dev/signin. the mobile sidebar container div uses JS commands so i wanted to find out too 
[10:22:02] <serafeim> the JS.x functions are converted to some funny js like this: https://dpaste.com/6PMAQGQHR
[10:25:18] <sekun[m]> and that seems to be parsed by this https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view/blob/master/assets/js/phoenix_live_view/js.js
[10:31:20] <serafeim> it would be great if we could use that to avoid stuff like aplinejs and friends
[10:31:59] <Nicd> doesn't actually look too difficult to rip out
[10:33:01] <Nicd> I can already think of use cases for this
[10:34:19] <serafeim> let's ask josevalim when he's available if he considers this
[10:36:54] <Nicd> ericmj: will I be booted off hex.pm if I put ads (loaded via JS) in my documentation? or do you have a CSP preventing that?
[10:38:56] <serafeim> Nicd: i have seen some packages that say this message after I do a `mix deps.get`: You have added/upgraded packages you could sponsor, run `mix hex.sponsor` to learn more
[10:39:15] <Nicd> yes, that is not legal here so I can't do that
[10:39:23] <serafeim> lol both cowboy and ranch are on that list i didn't even know
[10:40:21] <serafeim> now that i mention ranch, has anybody used https://github.com/mtrudel/thousand_island ? it seems a very good alternative to ranch
[10:40:42] <Nicd> also https://github.com/mtrudel/bandit
[10:40:53] <Nicd> haven't tried it but it looks interesting
[10:40:57] <serafeim> yes bandit is the alternative to cowboy
[10:41:38] <serafeim> i've used only the tohusand_island on a toy project and it seems to work great: https://github.com/spapas/tcp-elixir/blob/master/lib/tcp/connection_handler.ex
[10:42:14] <serafeim> i have to confess that i couldn't use ranch; i wasn't able to understand how it's working nor its docs. 
[10:42:31] <serafeim> but thousand island wasa breeze

[15:26:12] <mhmd> Hi, with three connected elixir nodes, where node A and B share the same code, and process requests coming from node C, how can I evenly distribute requests from node C to node A and B? Is there any standard tools for that? or should I write a router which randomly selects between A and B? Nodes talk to each other with phoenix pubsub, btw

[20:42:45] <mhmd> Zarathu: No, they're GenServers with handle_info to receive messages from pubsub
[20:42:45] <Zarathu> you could use a round robin technique of just alternating between A and B, but depending on the type of work and how much of it there is, you could use something like broadway or genstage
[20:45:07] <Zarathu> it sounds like A and B are the same type of worker and they do the same work, right? but they both listen to the same pubsub messages and the burden is being placed on C to determine which worker to send the message to?
