[03:36:20] <rajkosto> https://pastebin.com/Nx3nE0Ey this works to emulate it but i doubt thats the actual algorithm
[03:38:01] <jtgd> does it give same results?
[03:38:25] <rajkosto> for the whole sample size i have, yeah
[03:38:51] <jtgd> then why do you think it's not the same algorithm?
[03:39:19] <rajkosto> looks wrong and hacky
[03:39:55] <sarnold> sounds like software anyway :)
[03:40:03] <jtgd> it does look wrong. Just test the lsbit and xor the whole 90006000

[03:41:58] <jtgd> I'm just going by your first paste, I'm not running the code. But it does resemble CRC that I used years ago
[03:42:14] <rajkosto> yeah my first paste has 0x6000 as the difference sometimes
[03:42:15] <ms7821> could it be a galois lfsr? I'm not super hot on obscure lfsrs
[03:42:19] <rajkosto> not always 0x90006000
[03:43:09] <jtgd> oic yes. well if your code works then I guess that's it.
[03:43:11] <ms7821> looks like a galois lfsr would only have one carry
[03:45:03] <ms7821> maybe it's two 16-bit galois lfsrs combined
[03:45:14] <rajkosto> maybe the original algorithm applies to halfwords instead of 32bit words and looks better?

[05:24:59] <euouae> Hi! New to this channel. Also new to cryptography :)  I'm reading Serious Cryptography by Aumasson. Why does C = (PRNG(K, R) + P, R) not give NM-CPA? Here K is a key, R is random bits appended to the key to match the size of the plaintext P and PRNG() is pseudorandom bits of same size
[05:25:17] <euouae> NM = non-malleability and CPA = chosen plaintext attacker
[05:26:29] <sarnold> is C a tuple or is there a missing function?
[05:27:51] <ms7821> I'm assuming you mean this paragraph:
[05:28:13] <ms7821> > the previous IND-CPA construction (DRBG(K, R) ⊕ P, R) is not NM-CPA: given a ciphertext (X, R), you can create the ciphertext (X ⊕ 1, R), which is a valid ciphertext of P ⊕ 1, thus contradicting the notion of non-malleability
[05:28:37] <ms7821> + and ⊕ are different in crypto - ⊕ means xor
[05:29:08] <ms7821> so it's saying you can blindly modify the ciphertext and the victim won't know
[05:29:26] <euouae> that's right ms7821, and true, I used + carelessly 
[05:29:41] *** Joins: stiell (~stiell@gateway/tor-sasl/stiell)
[05:29:42] <euouae> my problem with the proof is that the attacker somehow gets to retain the same R
[05:29:47] <ms7821> (this is incidentally the main problem with one-time pad)
[05:30:10] <euouae> As I understood it, the attacker gets to run encryption queries, and each query involves a different R, but the proof requires the same R to show that it's not NM-CPA
[05:33:04] <ms7821> yeah, you do normally analyse it as games, but at this point it's the other way around to IND-CPA
[05:33:18] <ms7821> the attacker presents the modified ciphertext to the victim, who can't tell it's been modified
[05:33:29] <ms7821> (or more strictly, is invalid)
[05:34:06] <euouae> I will be back in 10, I may disconnect in the meantime
[05:40:52] <euouae> ms7821, ah thank you. I get it now. 
[05:41:25] <euouae> because it's called NM-CPA, I thought the attacker chooses the plaintext...
[05:41:51] <euouae> and I was thinking of the /second/ plaintext, not the initial one
[05:42:00] <ms7821> ahh yeah, the book kinda goes quiet on the game at that point
[05:42:12] <ms7821> (I've got a copy sitting on my shelf waiting to be read... one day)
[05:42:33] <euouae> so I guess the process is, choose P, create (C,R), alter to (C(+)1, R) which the victim decrypts to P(+)1 -- and you know this
[05:43:09] <euouae> ms7821, awesome! I'm just getting into cryptography myself (not for coin) and this is the book I'm starting with, I have a math background
[05:43:15] <ms7821> yeah, or in a system where it's Alice sending a message to Bob, Mallory can change the "destination bank account" by the xor of their own account with Alice's
[05:43:46] <ms7821> it's by all accounts a good book, I just have super bad reading habits
[05:43:47] <euouae> It actually also explains non-malleability as a name too. thanks

[20:31:16] <koolfy> Hello :)
[20:31:27] <koolfy> I have a very awkward question to ask here
[20:32:29] *** Joins: mouseghost (~draco@user/mouseghost)
[20:32:54] <koolfy> I am trying to convince coworkers that installing nginx to do TLS termination and using dm-crypt to encrypt database hard drives does not make us a "dual-use cyberweapon crypto tool" that must be declared, regulated and blocked from export between France and the US for example
[20:33:33] <koolfy> I seems so obvious to me and yet I can't seem to find the right legalese document stating this clearly enough to kill this months old debate at work
[20:34:03] <river> lol
[20:34:07] <river> it probably does
[20:34:25] <river> those laws dont matter anymore though
[20:34:26] <koolfy> I guess people here might have dealt with this and might know where to point me, or what legalese search worlds I was missing to find the right clues.
[20:34:33] <koolfy> Ah?
[20:34:43] <koolfy> Well, I though we dealt with this i nthe OpenPGP days.
[20:34:50] <river> yes in the past
[20:34:52] <koolfy> the great first cryptowars
[20:36:05] <koolfy> I am trying to convince lawyers to stop sending me emails about this freaking out, until I find legalese resources I won't be at peace :(
[20:36:34] <koolfy> what do you mean "these laws don't matter anymore"? Are htye superseeded by something? Or do you just mean "nobody follows them"
[20:36:41] <yawkat> koolfy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States
[20:37:03] <koolfy> please let the most basic wikipedia page not be what I was missing all along.
[20:37:04] <aczid> I see you are connecting from France koolfy 
[20:37:18] <koolfy> Yes!
[20:37:20] <yawkat> "adding an exception for publicly available encryption source code"
[20:37:23] <aczid> is the company based there too?
[20:38:13] <koolfy> oh my god yawkat. It *was* that simple.
[20:38:14] <aczid> I don't know enough about it but I think france has always been especially difficult about these rules
[20:38:57] <koolfy> I am very glad looking like a total idiot if it means I have concrete evidence to send back to the lawyers
[20:39:06] <koolfy> Yes France was special, but not in this way actually
[20:39:19] <koolfy> But it's a US company, with a team in France
[20:39:22] <tolarz> why do countries still impose bans on encryption?
[20:39:24] <tolarz> hilarious
[20:39:24] <aczid> cool
[20:39:26] <yawkat> my understanding is that this is still a legal issue with commercial software but that OSS is pretty much exempt nowadays
[20:39:54] <koolfy> yeah so commercial software using FOSS standard aes cryptography wouldn't be regulated
[20:40:16] <tolarz> "publicly available encryption source code" -- in case of GPL, the program ia OSS, but needs not be publicly available
[20:41:05] <koolfy> yawkat: if someday, somewhere, you find someone, in any setting, who answers to the nickname of "koolfy", in the meatspace, please remind this person of this very exchange and I will buy you more beers or club mate than you can physically ingest.
[20:41:23] <yawkat> :D
[20:42:01] <koolfy> tolarz: I think those are remnants of stuff about selling encrypted UHF military fighter jet radios
[20:42:27] <koolfy> Now F35s probably use zoom to coordinate bomb strikes

[22:29:27] <iz> i remember in the 90s, i brought a copy of applied cryptography with me on a family trip to spain b/c i was reading it
[22:29:41] <iz> and i realized afterwards i probably violated some laws
[22:36:14] <ericonr> man, these export laws are so stupid >.<
[22:36:15] <MacGyver> Also, if you get a couple of smart card chips implanted in the backs of your hands, you can truthfully say that your fists are export-controlled munitions.
[22:36:29] <MacGyver> Whether or not this makes you popular has yet to be tested.
[22:37:08] <dusk> :')
[22:40:03] <dusk> I have never heard of software actually being regulated, but I think the regulation of hardware is still somewhat common yeah

[23:04:57] <MacGyver> The main thing is, iirc, but don't cite me on this, that we're god-awful slow to implement changes to the Wassenaar arrangement.
[23:05:46] <MacGyver> But in Dutch constitution it clearly states that international agreements trump national law so you'd have a good case of getting it ruled in accordance with that anyway.
[23:06:38] <MacGyver> I mean if you get your hands on Suite A cryptography, aside from the *other* laws you'll be breaking, they'll definitely care about export controls. But for modern, peer-reviewed cryptography, it's a bit like those cases where a car still must be preceded by a walking man ringing a bell.

[23:29:50] <sarnold> it's kinda hard to be sure ;) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_Suite_A_Cryptography
[23:30:02] <dusk> MacGyver: Check xD
[23:30:16] <MacGyver> For all we know they're all rebranded Rijndael.
[23:30:35] <dusk> They might be some of the more modern RC ciphers
[23:30:45] <dusk> Or non-backdoored Simon/Speck?

[23:33:57] <Peng> MacGyver: That would be hilarious. Some spies finally compromise the most secret NSA servers to steal the Suite A source code and find an out-of-date OpenSSL FIPS install.
[23:34:59] <sarnold> lol
[23:35:14] <sarnold> .. with 'eal' crossed out and 'nsa' scribbled in place
[23:36:04] <MacGyver> Peng: To be perfectly honest, I would not be in the least surprised by that.
[23:36:27] <MacGyver> They've mostly shown they're perfectly fine with everyone just using AES-256.
[23:36:44] <MacGyver> Why bother working on creating your own ciphers if you can spend the same minds cracking others.
[23:36:52] <MacGyver> Or cracking other systems around them.
[23:37:30] <MacGyver> At this point Suite A being mostly a smoke-and-mirrors thing to throw off foreign TLA's, would that be so weird?
[23:38:33] <sarnold> you figure they use telegram and signal like everyone else?
[23:38:52] <MacGyver> No, it's definitely possible they've built in-house *systems* around the crypto.
[23:39:17] <MacGyver> But I wouldn't be surprised if the crypto used itself is nothing truly developed secretly in-house.
