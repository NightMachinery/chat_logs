[01:36:44] <ordos> Albright, you ever play around with max_input_var's limits?
[01:36:51] <ordos> scales pretty well
[01:37:11] <Albright> I had to the other day, yes, if that's what you're referring to.
[01:38:00] <ordos> Nah I don't mean the default limits like your 1k issue or my 10k issue
[01:38:05] <ordos> or was yours 1.5k?
[01:38:07] <ordos> I forget
[01:38:16] <ordos> I mean stretch limits at scale
[01:38:26] <Albright> IIRC the original limit is 1k. I think I put our server at 4k.
[01:39:28] <ordos> Yeah so I've got my guys running tests on the maximum it can handle. Curiousity R&D.

[01:41:53] <ordos> biberu, honestly I havent' looked up much, aside from my chat with Albright. Leave the young guns to it.
[01:42:00] <biberu> it's not a performance feature

[01:52:35] <ordos> Albright, pity we never thought about that.
[01:54:28] <Albright> I am aware it's not a performance feature. In my case my client's site has an actual page which will have more than 1000 input fields in some cases
[01:56:40] <biberu> Albright: i interpreted ordos' comments as if it were, perhaps i was mistaken
[01:59:23] <ordos> biberu, nah, there's a prior conversation Albright and I had some time ago, where we laid the contextual groundwork. We ran a nation-wide census project in Africa and pushed max_input_vars pretty far. Albright and I were comparing notes.

[07:29:17] <jtreminio> I'm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel for all the openapi work I've been doing over the last 6 months
[07:36:29] <BadAdviceCat> jtreminio, cool.
[07:36:56] <BadAdviceCat> What did you di specifically, if you do not mind sharing?
[07:37:00] <BadAdviceCat> did*
[07:42:31] <jtreminio> BadAdviceCat, so there's some weird quirks around the openapi-generator took for generating SDKs
[07:43:46] <jtreminio> Depending on the content-type of an endpoint, the generated code will be different. For example, "application/json" will create an endpoint that takes a typed objects in its parameter, like this: https://xeroapi.github.io/xero-php-oauth2/docs/v2/accounting/index.html#api-Accounting-createPayment
[07:44:39] <jtreminio> but, if your endpoint allows uploading a file you must use multipart/form-data (or the other one for form data). The generated code now expects all params to be passed individually in the method signature: https://xeroapi.github.io/xero-php-oauth2/docs/v2/accounting/index.html#api-Accounting-createAccountAttachmentByFileName
[07:45:54] <jtreminio> the latter one is terrible UX, I think, and it makes no sense that it's so completely different from the former. If an endpoint has a ton of params that have defaults, but user wants to set the value of the last one, they have to pass all those params first
[07:47:00] <jtreminio> most of my work has revolved around forcing _all_ our endpoints to behave as if they were all application/json, including the ones that allow binary file data. So far we've got php, ruby, typescript, python, .net, and java SDKs with this functionality.
[07:48:44] <jtreminio> I'm also creating a unified test fixture dataset that all our SDKs must use when running their tests, to ensure we maintain parity and functionality across all the languages. I had to write a bit of ruby. not a fan.
[07:52:22] <BadAdviceCat> xD I see. Would you rather most of these take 2 params, like $xeroTenantId, $something ?
[07:52:55] <jtreminio> the first param is fine, it's a URL query parameter
[07:53:04] <jtreminio> but yeah, I'd rather a single, typed object containing all the data
[07:56:15] <jtreminio> it's also surprising how so many of the openapi-generator generators have such poor support for discriminators! most of them simply cannot handle it
[07:57:03] <jtreminio> discriminator being if "field" value is "bar", instantiate Foo::class; if "field" value is "qwe" instantiate Zcx::class
[07:57:44] <jtreminio> it's a core part of the openapi spec, but support is simply lacking. I've had to add that in to several of the generators (PHP, ruby, .net)

[16:49:21] <nkm> i need to insert an external div inside a foreach loop. like this in picutre https://ibb.co/rFTrLYQ

[16:49:56] <nkm> i want to show this "custom add" inside the videos loopp
[16:50:17] <nkm> how can i do this ?
[16:50:44] <Blondie101010> to be able to know how to write PHP code that outputs that, you first need to know what to output
[16:51:08] <Blondie101010> the output itself depends on HTML, CSS, and likely JS
[16:51:16] <nkm> yes
[16:51:19] <Blondie101010> once you get that, you can start writing the PHP code to do it
[16:51:49] <nkm> but is there any way to insert any external div inside a query without using js
[16:52:22] <nkm> i know it is impossible.
[16:52:34] <nkm> but i am just asking about possibilites
[16:52:53] <Blondie101010> well if you currently `echo "<div>something</div>";` and want to add a layer, you can: `echo "<div><div>something</div></div>";`
[16:53:07] <Blondie101010> but it doesn't seem to be what you're looking for
[16:53:42] <Blondie101010> I suspect you don't know what to output or else couldn't make sense of the question
[16:53:54] <__adrian> ^ do you know what the html you want looks like?
[16:54:07] <nkm> is it possible to use counter on loop and insert something after specific number of looping
[16:54:18] <Blondie101010> of course
[16:54:37] <__adrian> so you want   loop ( <video> <video> <video> <ad> <video> )  ?
[16:54:47] <nkm> may be
[16:55:00] <Blondie101010> you can do that with sub-loop, or a simple condition like `if ($counter % 8 == 0)`
[16:55:07] <__adrian> then yes, as blondie says, of course
[16:55:25] <__adrian> though i'd ask why you're wanting to avoid javascript.
[16:56:26] <nkm> if i can acheive my goal in php then i don't need to go for js

[16:57:13] <__adrian> that's not a good "why." think about what makes most sense and is a better solution first. _after that_, decide what's workable.
[16:57:13] <nkm> yes it uses

[22:45:05] <__adrian> dimbag: !+recommend due diligence
[22:45:05] <php-bot> dimbag, we recommend you research many, try a few, pick one; rinse and repeat as necessary. see also /msg php-bot recommend
[22:45:41] <da_wunder> I would recommend you to try out different frameworks like laravel, symfony - do your research about each of those and make your decision about which one you "should" use

[22:46:20] *** Joins: mjsir911 (~bnc@user/mjsir911)
[22:46:31] <da_wunder> but personally I would recommend symfony - but that is just my personal opinion - you need to make your own decision
[22:48:50] *** Joins: BadAdviceCat (~BadAdvice@user/badadvicecat)
[22:48:58] <BadAdviceCat> cwchristerw, you can look it up :D - It's a spec written by W3C and FIDO. The whole point is to allow your users to login to your website using public key cryptography. You can check out the demo here. https://webauthn.io/
[22:50:05] <__adrian> ^ this is the underlying reason - almost all recommendations will be based on personal preference. and the vast majority of people never did the "research many, try a few" steps, so not only is it opinion, it's completely uninformed opinion.
[22:50:39] <__adrian> ntm everyone's different. try the ones that make the most sense to you.
[22:50:44] <cwchristerw> Thanks, BadAdviceCat :D I will look it up soon
[22:50:52] <BadAdviceCat> cwchristerw,  If you do not have one of these security USB devices, you can use https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/virtual-authenticators-ta/gafbpmlmeiikmhkhiapjlfjgdioafmja to test the demo. https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/
[22:50:55] *** Quits: Nekomander (~BadAdvice@user/badadvicecat) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[22:51:19] <cwchristerw> Okay
[22:52:09] <BadAdviceCat> You would use this in PHP https://github.com/web-auth/webauthn-lib to set it up.
[22:52:13] <da_wunder> personally tried laravel like ~6months ago - and really I didn't like so much - for me laravel is "forcing" you to do things as they like - and that is not "bad" thing - but personally I want to be control
[22:52:16] <BadAdviceCat> Then there are others: https://packagist.org/?query=webauthn
[22:52:52] <da_wunder> + imho laravel is doing too much "magic" that you don't understand
[22:53:25] *** Quits: mjsir911 (~bnc@user/mjsir911) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:53:33] <__adrian> yeah
[22:54:01] <__adrian> the underlying non-magic stuff is there (last i checked anyway) but understanding it is difficult because only the magic is documented
[22:54:24] *** Joins: mjsir911 (~bnc@user/mjsir911)
[22:56:21] <da_wunder> yeah, and that is why people should really try different frameworks - and make their _own_ decision which one to use
[22:56:47] <da_wunder> and not be afraid to migrate another framework if/when that is needed
[22:57:34] <__adrian> also good to not be afraid to use parts/components of various libraries/frameworks. (yes, something symfony does well.)
[22:58:03] *** Quits: gonogo (~gonogo@167.88.62.87) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:58:05] <da_wunder> and sure that kind of change will be costly - but that is what you need to do, if/when that is really necessary
[22:59:22] <da_wunder> __adrian: hmm, last I check symfony uses only components from symfony ecosystem - which part is using something else framework?
[23:00:25] <__adrian> meant symfony makes it easy for devs to to use individual components without forcing wholesale adoption of the entire framework
[23:00:39] <da_wunder> I'm just curious to know which symfony component is using something from another framework, because I haven't used those components - or I have missed that totally
[23:00:47] <da_wunder> aah
[23:00:52] <da_wunder> that is very true
[23:01:00] <__adrian> yeah, phrasing. i meant the opposite  :p
[23:01:07] <da_wunder> and one of the main things why I like symfony
[23:01:41] <da_wunder> and that is one reason why eg. laravel uses symfony components :D
[23:05:13] <da_wunder> but now it's sauna time, back in ~1hour ->
[23:06:48] <BadAdviceCat> I'm using symfony without twig. Just so I can demonstrate to people what it looks like with and without twig.

[23:35:45] <Sammitch> counterpoint, this channel is uncharacteristically active for IRC.
[23:37:16] <Slartibart> I have a model, it has a property called items, that is an array with instances of another model. If I have data for my "root" model in an array I simply do new RootModel($myDataArray); to instantiate and populate, right? But how to populate the items property all the way, that is instantiate the number of DependencyModel needed and populate all of them? Can that be done when instantiating Root? ?Or do I
[23:37:22] <__adrian> "channel {x} is dead" doesn't make a question on-topic here. but that doesn't mean it's off-topic. if the question is about php (we don't need to know much/anything about laravel to answer it), it's fine.
[23:37:22] <Slartibart> need some foreach() on the side?
[23:37:54] <__adrian> i'd call that laravel-specific, but someone may know
[23:38:06] <__adrian> also seems like something you could figure out from a tutorial
[23:40:08] <Slartibart> __adrian: Do you know how to do it? I take it you don't?
[23:41:37] <__adrian> i don't use laravel much, no. one of the reasons i'm here on #php and not on #laravel
