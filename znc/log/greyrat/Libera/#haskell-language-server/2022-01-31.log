[20:27:54] <fendor[m]> > <@guibou:matrix.org> Hello there.... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/86f11e65f99ae230bfc36032f4a918830d09bb07)
[20:29:09] <fendor[m]>  * Hi!
[20:29:09] <fendor[m]> The indexing step is executed by hiedb. If the actual compile options are not different, then I think it shouldn't invalidate the other files.
[21:15:51] <Guillaum[m]> fendor: thank you, This motivates me to improve our tool, because right now, for file `A.hs` it may generates `-XGHC2021\nA.hs` and for file B.hs (which depends on `A.hs`) it may generates `-XGHC2021\nA.hs\n-XGHC2021\nB.hs` (see the duplicated flags here). If `hiedb` is able to see the similarity between `-XGHC2021\nA.hs\nB.hs` and `-XGHC2021\nA.hs`, I'll be good.
[21:17:03] <fendor[m]> hm, I am actually not entirely sure... I think it should use a fingerprint of the flags, but I am not sure whether it does that before or after parsing the flags
[21:17:38] <fendor[m]> and after parsing should probably remove the duplication. Maybe not for include paths?
[21:18:42] <fendor[m]> when you run HLS in debug mode (supply --debug), can you see many lines of the form `New Component Cache HscEnvEq:`? 
[21:18:54] <Guillaum[m]> Let me check
[21:28:22] <Guillaum[m]> fendor: not much, just one in the middle of a session (I opened a file in the project, and jumped to many other files. I observed a lot of "indexing", but no more `New Component Cache HscEnvEq:`
[21:29:11] <fendor[m]> ok, then HLS probably merges many components into one
[21:30:39] <fendor[m]> I am a bit confused, what do the flags look like when you open a file that has dependencies on other files of your project?
[21:34:04] <Guillaum[m]> Imagine I have module Foo.A and Foo.B and modules Bar.C. flags for Foo.A et Foo.B are the same, says `-XGHC2021\n-isrc-foo\nsrc-foo/Foo/A.hs\nsrc-foo/Foo/B.hs`. However `Bar.C` is in another "project" and its flag file concatenate all the flags file of its dependencies, so here the part about the `Foo` project, plus its own part, so
[21:34:04] <Guillaum[m]> `-XGHC2021\n-isrc-foo\nsrc-foo/Foo/A.hs\nsrc-foo/Foo/B.hs\n-GHC2021\n-isrc-bar\nsrc-bar/Bar/C.hs`
[21:41:29] <fendor[m]> ah, of course makes sense
[21:41:54] <fendor[m]> deduplication might improve the situation, yeah
[21:46:03] <Guillaum[m]> I'll try that and benchmark a bit, hopefully it will help. Otherwise I'll move back to a monolithique flag file generated for the complete repo
[21:47:17] <Guillaum[m]> This being said, the changes (i think in 1.5.0.0) dramatically improved the situation, and I have the feeling that it eat less memory since I switched to GHC 9.2.
[21:50:14] <fendor[m]> 9.2 support has been added recently, so you are more likely to be on 1.6.0 or 1.6.1 ðŸ™‚ Anyway, it is great to see HLS improve ðŸ™‚
[21:56:58] <Guillaum[m]> (Well, it was two step improvement, I first saw the 1.5.0.0 new build system, then I switched to GHC 9.2). HLS changed so much things at work, I was able to deprecate so much tools. (And personally, I was able to switch back to vim after years of emacs that I was keeping only because it was the only "correct" haskell experience with one module which was able to do quickfix and stuffs, but that's personal ;)
[22:18:23] <Guillaum[m]> Anyone here using nix to develop HLS? I'm thinking about an important refactor of the nix-shell and I'd like to know if you agree.
[22:27:43] <fendor[m]> a lot of people use at least a nix-shell for development
[22:28:02] <fendor[m]> improvements are always welcome!
[22:46:25] <Guillaum[m]> Right now the nix-shell is trying to fetch / build with nix a lot of packages which won't be used by `cabal`. I'd like to remove that, and let cabal build dependencies (this will simplify a lot the nix-shell).
[22:53:29] <michaelpj[m]> Guillaum: I'd encourage you to make an issue and explain the problem and how you'd like to fix it. Conversations here get lost!
[22:54:12] <Guillaum[m]> michaelpj: Thank you, I'll update https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/2655
[22:54:35] <Guillaum[m]> (is that fine if I discuss the changes in my MR instead of opening a new issue?)
