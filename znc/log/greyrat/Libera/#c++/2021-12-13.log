[17:46:44] <apollo13> I realize that GCC throws a warning here and breaks down nicely https://wandbox.org/permlink/7s2F9IbsWaHB7XQO -- but clang compiles this just fine (and apparently safely). I understand that there is not so much as a wrong and right here, but which behavior do you think is more expected?
[17:46:46] <aniketgm> pa: the ownership shifts. so yes.
[17:47:24] <apollo13> to make matters worse for GCC if I reduce the string to half the length it always returns it properly, so I am wondering what else is at play here

There's not really a logical option other than making the moved-from list empty. But the standard only requires "unspecified but valid state", so to be completely safe, we can't assume that's "empty"
[18:32:39] <pa> Alipha: but doesn't a std::list contain pointers?
[18:33:00] <pa> or, i thought it's a linked list, but i might be wrong

[22:47:08] <apollo13> RandomReader: ok thanks; I guess I do not fully understand the error message. I mean I know that the initializer_list is just a small proxy around T[]; but I thought the assignment would just copy the data over -- where exactly does undefined come in?
[22:48:35] <RandomReader> initializer_list doesn't own any data, it's a view type like string_view
[22:48:56] <RandomReader> only the compiler can create the actual storage, which is a const T[] underneath .. it then creates an initializer list that is looking at it
[22:49:05] <RandomReader> so the lifetime is effectively tied to the context where the braces are
[22:50:13] <RandomReader> in general, initializer_list should only be used in temporary contexts like function params, it's not meant for more common variable use
[22:52:47] <RandomReader> put another way, if there's going to be an initializer_list created, it happens "{right here}" .. you can hold *that* initializer_list in a variable and it will last as long as the variable does, but anything beyond that (like assigning it to a different initializer_list) will not go as expected, because only that first original one matches the lifetime
[22:52:48] <apollo13> RandomReader: I see, yeah we only ran into this by accident because someone typed "auto var = {a,b,c}" instead of "vector<T> var{a,b,c};"
[22:53:29] <RandomReader> (the underlying rule being that the compiler's created storage is required to live with the original initializer_list)
[22:53:46] <RandomReader> ah, gotcha
[22:53:54] *** Joins: dsrt^ (~dsrt@wsip-98-188-240-142.mc.at.cox.net)
[22:54:11] <apollo13> I guess the part that I do not understand if I do "var = {a}" here, why it doesn't even life for the time of the assignment
[22:54:27] <apollo13> on the other hand some_func({a}) would be valid I guess?
[22:54:29] <RandomReader> I'd probably tackle that one by seeing if there's a lint rule you can apply, I'd expect e.g. clang-tidy to be able to complain about bare initializer_lists for auto like that
[22:54:52] <RandomReader> it does live for the duration of the assignment, it just dies at the end of that line
[22:55:17] <RandomReader> sort of like   foo = string().c_str()
[22:55:58] <apollo13> that one I understand
[22:56:24] <apollo13> I guess I just don't see the temporary objects involved there clearly yet for initializer_list, anyways thank you for your help I'll go and RTFM a bit
[22:56:32] *** Joins: KAHR-Alpha (~Alpha@2a01cb0d024a66006dab7ab0a7593362.ipv6.abo.wanadoo.fr)
[22:56:34] <RandomReader> yeah it's a special rule set
[22:57:12] <RandomReader> for "{init}" the compiler creates const T[] and then creates an initializer_list that refers to it, and that auto-created initializer_list is the only one the lifetime is tied to
[22:57:24] <RandomReader> as-if it were a const T& lifetime extension
[22:57:45] <RandomReader> in the assignment, it just ends up as a temporary on the right-hand side, so the lifetime ends there
[22:58:06] <apollo13> the lifetime of the inner T[]?
[22:58:13] <RandomReader> the T[] is external
[22:58:38] <RandomReader> just some compiler-invented magic
[22:58:59] <RandomReader> not being stored inside is sort of the issue here, since that means it doesn't follow along to be copied or anything
[23:00:27] <apollo13> yeah my naive understanding was that assignment here would basically iterate over the array and copy the contents over
[23:00:59] <RandomReader> initializer_list itself basically just has a { const T*, size_t } inside
[23:01:24] <RandomReader> (or equivalent)
[23:05:57] <apollo13> RandomReader: Oh I think I slowly begin to understand. Because initializer_list has no assignment operator that assignment will just copy the pointer over which of course breaks if the array is temporary
[23:06:17] *** Parts: bpalmer (~user@user/bpalmer) (ERC (IRC client for Emacs 27.2))
[23:06:39] <RandomReader> right
[23:07:17] <apollo13> any reason why initializer_list doesn't implement a sensible assignment operator? Because it is just not ment to be used in such a way?
[23:07:26] <RandomReader> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/initializer_list tries to describe it too, if it helps
[23:07:38] <RandomReader> yeah it's just not intended for this kind of use
[23:07:55] <apollo13> actually your { const T*, size_t } comment and looking at the source made most sense to me :)
[23:08:13] <RandomReader> its purpose is just to be a value representing a view of an array, so you can have a function(initializer_list<T> args)
[23:08:33] <apollo13> wouldn't it make sense then to actually implement an assignment operator but error/panic -- see like easy to run into UB here
[23:08:34] <RandomReader> combined with compiler support to store those args at the call site, with no other allocation needed
[23:08:45] <apollo13> on the other hand string().c_str() is just as easy to run into
[23:08:56] <RandomReader> assignment itself isn't a problem though, as long as the lifetimes are ok
[23:09:23] <RandomReader> e.g. that function(args) can do whatever it wants to transport that around internally, assign to other initializer_lists, etc .. as long as it finishes before it returns
[23:10:00] <apollo13> oh right that is also why auto vec2 = {valueLongString}; vec = vec2 did work -- because the lifetime was okay now because vec2 lives longer than vec
[23:10:00] <RandomReader> so it could be that was just considered useful flexibility, no reason to overly restrict it .. but I don't know for certain, I haven't looked for any of the original discussions about this
[23:10:18] <apollo13> and as such the pointer to T* will be valid as long as vec2 lives
[23:10:19] <RandomReader> right
[23:10:57] <apollo13> thank you for your patience -- I am not very fast with such concepts; but it is clear now
[23:11:08] <apollo13> gotta look for clang-tidy rules now
[23:11:17] <apollo13> would be nice if I could catch that
[23:11:30] <RandomReader> no worries, initializer_list is a bit unique
[23:15:41] <RandomReader> hmm, I thought something had a lint rule for this, but I'm not finding it offhand either
[23:16:00] <RandomReader> maybe ask that particular question in #c++-general, see if they know
