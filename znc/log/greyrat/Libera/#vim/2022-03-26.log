[00:27:18] <bertieb> If I'm editing a file in xxd mode, is there a way to i) figure out the, er, 'distance' between two things, and ii) quickly jump forwards / backwards by that amount?

[00:29:04] *** Quits: PlasmaHH (~PlasamaHH@user/plasmahh) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[00:29:08] <bertieb> well, mode is a bit of a misnomer
[00:29:16] <romainl> if I'm not mistaken, you are just piping the buffer through xxd, right?
[00:29:27] <bertieb> right
[00:29:48] <romainl> ath that point it's all just weird looking text

[00:30:15] <bertieb> true, but there's an ascii representation 
[00:30:35] <romainl> yeah, last column
[00:30:43] <romainl> what do you want to do with it?
[00:30:56] <bertieb> jump between team names in a ROM
[00:31:08] <bertieb> I mean, I could do what I want with strings and an awk program
[00:31:46] <bertieb> but I'm trying to use vim more to be better acquainted with different features
[00:32:30] <romainl> there is a section in the doc :h edit-binary
[00:32:30] <digmbot> :help edit-binary -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/editing.txt.html#edit-binary
[00:32:33] <bertieb> and I figured that for a binary with fairly well-defined structures and offsets, vim could measure an offset and move the cursor forwards / backwards by that amount
[00:32:46] <bertieb> but having loaded it up I quickly got stuck
[00:32:53] <bertieb> cheers, will have a read
[00:33:22] <romainl> Vim is not really equipped for what you are trying to do I'm afraid
[00:33:32] <bertieb> aye fair enough
[00:33:42] <romainl> :qa
[00:33:45] <romainl> oops
[00:34:07] <bertieb> it's rare that vim can't do something, so I'll let it pass this one time~ ;-P
[00:34:15] *** Joins: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi)
[00:36:26] <romainl> Vim is pretty good at "text" in the most generic meaning of the word. With binary, not so much. And with data, well, you would have to teach it about your data to stop it from treating it like text.
[00:37:12] <romainl> What you want to do is not very well defined, though, so who knows?
[00:37:41] *** Joins: rru04 (~rru04@public-gprs230463.centertel.pl)
[00:38:21] <bertieb> yeah fair enough- it's one of those thigns where it's defined in my head
[00:38:55] <bertieb> manually find the first team, place mark, manually find second team, place mark; get mark2-mark1; jump ahead by difference

[00:39:44] <romainl> is "manually find the first team" something that can be done with some regex?
[00:40:02] <bertieb> aye, I know what it is

[00:44:01] <bertieb> I'm trying to use vim less as a simple text editor with some fancy features and more, er, 'vimly'
[00:44:02] <romainl> You would need some kind of goal for that. Some problem to solve. Like "place a mark on each team name in one operation"
[00:44:05] <bertieb> ill-defined though that is
[00:44:16] <romainl> ill-defined indeed
[00:44:46] <romainl> Vim is a simple text editor with some fancy features, though
[00:44:54] *** Joins: vitali64 (~vitali64@user/vitali64)
[00:44:54] <bertieb> true
[00:45:50] <romainl> using it differently would not exactly be "more vimly",  rather "less vimly"
[00:46:14] <bertieb> I'm not sure I follow
[00:46:22] <bertieb> but that's probably on me for being unclear
[00:46:34] <romainl> anyway, problems comes first, then come solutions
[00:47:35] <bertieb> that's one way of looking at it, sure
[00:48:48] <romainl> you open your rom in a text editor, for some reason, and now what? what is the problem, now? what is the next thing to do with that rom? defining that problem might help you go forward.

[22:48:27] <Payam> Hi. What is the best autoformatter for python in vim?
[22:48:51] <habamax> the same as in other editors I guess
[22:49:02] <romainl> what a strange question
[22:49:09] <Payam> plugin

[22:50:04] <romainl> Vim uses external programs, Payam, so whatever works for you
[22:50:36] <romainl> find a program that does what you want outside of Vim then integrate it
[22:50:36] <Payam> romainl, ah you mean I should do somekind of mapping to other configuration without installing plugins?
[22:50:41] <Payam> that could work.
[22:50:43] <Payam> smart
[22:51:38] <habamax> patience!
[22:51:38] <Payam> how about that. even romainl can be smart some times.
[22:51:42] <romainl> I hear black is trendy these days
[22:51:56] <Payam> nah. I don't like it. it replaces ' with "
[22:52:16] <Payam> But maybe I give it a chance anyway

[23:07:51] <Payam> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15285032/autopep8-with-vim
[23:08:04] <lopid> you have to set the filetype after entering that command

[23:08:37] <lopid> i don't know who that is
[23:08:41] <Payam> it says filetype python
[23:08:48] <Payam> should it be .py insteada?
[23:09:11] <lopid> you've configured vim to do something when a filetype is set. it doesn't automatically do it to anything that already have the filetype set
