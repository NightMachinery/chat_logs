[00:02:14] <Suchiman> (i suppose if it absolutely must be strings for table names, you could use MakeGenericMethod to invoke QueryThings but you need a mapping between tablename and entity type name)
[00:04:18] <Guest53> well, it doesn't have to be strings. i am actually open to any solution. what i am currently doing is running this: var tableTypes = Context.Model.GetEntityTypes().ToList();
[00:04:29] <Guest53> then i am filtering out irrelevant tables based on the types
[00:04:43] <Guest53> then i just want to run simple query against each table, using the same db context, but it needs to be generic
[00:05:08] <Guest53> i don't want to explicity mention table names, since i want to reuse this approach in many databases/services
[00:05:35] <Suchiman> yeah okay GetType().GetMethod("QueryThings").MakeGenericMethod(type).Invoke(...); would do it then, given that they have a common interface
[00:08:26] <Suchiman> Guest53: although if there's no common interface and just a common property, i suppose you could do QueryThings<T>() { context.Set<T>().Where(x => EF.Property<DateTime>(x, "LastUpdated") > DateTime.MinValue); }
[00:11:19] <Guest53> maybe i am missing something, and apologizes for that - but in your last example, would T be a literal T or i am supposed to pass the type somehow?
[00:11:50] <Guest53> because i think that's what i am trying to achieve (last example)
[00:12:08] <Suchiman> Guest53: you can either pass it literally using QueryThings<A>(); or by utilizing MakeGenericMethod to pass a System.Type as a generic parameter

[01:18:10] <teegee> just use string seen = "3,6,42"

[01:18:24] <canton7> I'd probably store it as a sorted array of (start, end), and binary search my way to the right element

[01:30:55] <MizMahem> maybe. I confess I'm not a set guru.
[01:31:05] <MizMahem> Whichever word it means "items of this set, not in the other set."

[01:33:54] <biberu> MizMahem: i don't know the context, but was expecting the ranges to combine if they overlapped
[01:33:55] <JakeSays> you want indifference - the set of whatever
[01:34:18] <MizMahem> biberu: well, you will want that as well, but only internally I think.
[01:35:56] <MizMahem> Usage would be something like: `rangesToProcess = seenRanges.Difference(inputRanges); Process(rangesToProcess); seenRanges.Add(rangesToProcess);`
[01:39:53] <canton7> Oh wait, the inputs are ranges a well?
[01:40:56] <canton7> So you've got an existing set of ranges, and a set of new ranges, and you way to find which ranges you haven't already processed? So if you've already seen 3-5, and you get 1-4, you just want to process 1-2?

[11:10:15] <Nasp> MAybe me?
[11:10:19] <Nasp> We use it
[11:11:02] <Nasp> "unknown error" after being in queue for 15 minute to book a corona test
[11:16:12] <Nasp> jmer:  Any specific question regarding DbUp?
[11:18:23] <jmer> Nasp: Well... One; Is it any good? xD
[11:18:36] <bomb> MatthiasVance https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qVPNONdF58
[11:18:39] <jmer> Nasp: Ok two; has it given you any issues?
[11:19:30] <Nasp> jmer:  No issues
[11:19:41] <Nasp> But i've never quite understood why we use it
[11:19:51] <Nasp> Since we use EF so we could just make that apply migrations
[11:19:53] <jmer> Have you tried the VS Database project type that spits out dacpac/bacpac ? Nasp
[11:20:03] <Nasp> Also for some reason one of my collegues decided to make a DbUp version in powershell
[11:20:07] <Nasp> No i havent
[11:20:19] <Nasp> Never understood what i can use those pac thiniges for
[11:20:39] <jmer> Nasp:  we only have EF on one project and it's kinda broken because change happen to the DB outside of this one project... So I'm in the process of pitching a proposal to ditch EF so we use Dapper in all our solutions, but that means I need an alternative to having the DB definition in source control.
[11:20:52] <MatthiasVance> bomb: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
[11:20:59] <jmer> Nasp: It's just a deployment package for a DB, the dacpac is just the definition, the bacpac comes with data.
[11:21:16] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Or you can fix EF?
[11:21:23] <MatthiasVance> Scaffold from DB, go from there
[11:21:26] <bomb> MatthiasVance nice try. but I memorized that link years ago
[11:21:38] <jmer> MatthiasVance: I tried... It's not worth it, it will be broken again because changes to the DB are done outside of this solution using EF
[11:21:42] <MatthiasVance> bomb: I remember that. But in your head you still know it. :D
[11:22:06] <jmer> MatthiasVance: and covnerting from Code First to DB first is basically the same as writing a new data access layer...
[11:22:07] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Oh I thought that was an exception! Ahh, then yes it might make more sense to do that. Or you can scaffold every time? :D
[11:22:13] <jmer> So might as well be consistent and use Dapper all around
[11:22:20] <bomb> MatthiasVance shit. you evil

[11:22:32] <MatthiasVance> Or scaffold from DB every time and let DB people version DB things jmer ?
[11:22:33] <bomb> I rickroll'd in my mind lol
[11:22:37] <MatthiasVance> bomb: Exactly :D
[11:22:48] <jmer> MatthiasVance: but then we have this ONE project that nobody has ownership over that is acting all weird...
[11:22:55] <MatthiasVance> Why would it act weird?
[11:23:00] <jmer> because it's the odd one out
[11:23:05] <jmer> everything else uses Dapper.
[11:23:06] <MatthiasVance> Everybody else uses Dapper?
[11:23:07] <MatthiasVance> ahhhh
[11:23:09] <MatthiasVance> then yes
[11:23:17] <MatthiasVance> What gives you what you need?
[11:23:23] <MatthiasVance> I'd revisit that choice too
[11:23:23] <Nasp> jmer:  Yeah but i've never had the need in that way for bacpac
[11:23:29] <Nasp> But DbUp is fomr it just applies migrations
[11:23:39] <Nasp> But yeah can't you just fix EF
[11:23:52] <jmer> I tried. If I fix it now it's just a matter of time before there's drift again
[11:24:02] <Nasp> Stop the drifting?
[11:24:26] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Who cares if the DB changes btw? Are those related to your project?
[11:24:30] <jmer> Nasp: not that easy man xD... Nobody is gonna start up this shitty little data migration tool just to change the DB when they've done it differently the past 20 years
[11:24:33] <MatthiasVance> Or do you want to use migrations?
[11:24:49] <jmer> I don't care what we use as long as it's consistent and all of the team knows how to use it.
[11:24:59] <MatthiasVance> How are migrations to the DB done now?
[11:25:05] <MatthiasVance> I'm assuming outside of all projects?
[11:25:40] <jmer> Well this is just a small DB that exposes some data from an ERP... The "main" solution uses some kind of home rolled stuff for managing DB updates. but you have to remember this code is 20 years old
[11:25:47] <jmer> nothing like EF existed when it was born :P
[11:25:52] <Nasp> 20 years, damn
[11:26:02] <Nasp> Well ours is approaching 10 i think
[11:26:05] <jmer> Nasp: it's been maintained OK ish is my impression
[11:26:17] <jmer> I mean everything runs net5 and soon net6...
[11:26:21] <Nasp> Ahh nice
[11:26:27] <Nasp> Atleast that's something
[11:26:32] <Nasp> We just pile junk on top of ours
[11:26:36] <jmer> except this solution I am currently on... Which is .net standard 2.1 except the main project which is net5...
[11:26:48] <Nasp> netstandard is still okay
[11:27:10] <jmer> yeah but I see no point in using it when everything that consumes your code is net5 xD
[11:27:16] <Nasp> Nope
[11:27:32] <Nasp> One of my collegues changed all oru nuget packages to multi target netstandard 2.0 and net5
[11:27:38] <Nasp> Althought i dont see the point for that either
[11:27:58] <biberu> then what? is he going to litter the code with #ifs?
[11:28:14] <jmer> Anyways... standup in two min
[11:28:17] <Nasp> Well we dont use anything that requires it
[11:28:27] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Stand down!
[11:28:31] <Nasp> But would just be easier to keep it netstandard until we've eliminated .net 4.8
[11:28:32] <jmer> well
[11:28:34] <jmer> sit down I guess
[11:28:37] <jmer> my ass is planted on the chair

[11:43:40] <MatthiasVance> I have the subscription yes
[11:43:48] <MatthiasVance> It's just EUR 2 / month or something like that

[11:50:29] <Nasp> ahh i have one of those and i can't seem to get myself to do them
[11:50:47] <MatthiasVance> I want to go from job -> business at some point
[11:51:20] <MatthiasVance> One idea that I had last was no-code/low-code, but my MVP would be "integrate APIs without dev time", like some kind of API mapper
[11:51:25] <MatthiasVance> But that's based on what *I* think is fun
[11:51:27] <MatthiasVance> Not sure if it's useful
[11:52:04] <MaNa2k> so if you do a "peek-lock" on a servicebus message, can you "comlete" the message if you want to remove it from the queue ?
[11:52:44] * MatthiasVance peek-locks MaNa2k with a GUID: b34b0b0d-c99b-4314-a8db-541e17448cf9
[11:52:51] <MaNa2k> lol
[11:53:17] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, i was wondering when you would do that again :P
[11:53:27] <MatthiasVance> When you least expect GUID
[11:54:11] <MaNa2k> btw, im using peeklock because in case the process crashes, the messages wont get deleted, is that a correct way to use peeklock?
[11:54:51] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Ah right i remember your low code
[11:54:56] <MaNa2k> the other option is "RecieveAndDelete"
[11:55:02] <MatthiasVance> More services seem to be having issues
[11:55:03] <Nasp> But i would assume it's hard with all those existing one
[11:55:10] <MaNa2k> which would delete even if the process crashes right?
[11:55:32] <Nasp> Just dont acknowledge it before you are done processing
[11:55:45] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: That's why I wanted to do one feature first and build from that, so integrating with APIs easily, without much dev time
[11:56:06] <MaNa2k> Nasp, will it not be thrown in deadletter queue then ?
[11:56:10] <Nasp> MaNa2k:  no
[11:56:11] <MaNa2k> after 5 attempts or so
[11:56:18] <Nasp> Dead letter is when there's no receivers
[11:56:23] <MaNa2k> ah
[11:56:26] <Nasp> if it fails it should go on error queue
[11:56:30] <Nasp> Not sure how you've set yours up
[11:56:47] <MaNa2k> Nasp, well im pulling from the queue manually this time
[11:56:59] <MaNa2k> its not a serviece bus function
[11:57:21] <MaNa2k> but a timer trigger function
[11:57:26] <MaNa2k> which pulls from the queue
[11:57:44] <Nasp> You dont actually just open a connection
[11:57:52] <MaNa2k> yes i do
[11:58:13] <MaNa2k> i use the connectionstring to the service bus
[11:58:33] <MaNa2k> i use receiver.ReceiveMessagesAsync

[13:18:10] <Babbage> stringbuilder isnt a list is it, its allocated blocks of memory that get ammended into + extended as it grows - correct?
[13:24:45] <jmer> Babbage: "A StringBuilder is internally represented as a linked list of blocks each of which holds a chunk of the string.  It turns out string as a whole can also be represented as just a chunk, so that is what we do." taken from https://source.dot.net/#System.Private.CoreLib/StringBuilder.cs,adf60ee46ebd299f
[13:26:50] <Babbage> thanks
[13:27:38] <Babbage> i want a rotating list (new entries at the start, old entries dropping off the bottom) of a max length, so just going with a List<string> and a .removeat(end), insertat(0...) though it doesnt feel very performant to me
[13:31:32] <Nasp> Like a queue with max count?
[13:31:36] <Nasp> / expire policy
[13:32:04] <canton7> Babbage, use Queue<T> -- that's implemented as a ringbuffer
[13:32:56] <Babbage> ooh thanks canton7 :)

[13:52:49] <Nasp> The "then make a pull request" is a douche response
[13:53:05] <Nasp> Yes it's open source, but not everybody can maybe do taht
[13:53:13] <JakeSays> so is locking issues.
[13:53:18] <Nasp> And some open source libraries are quite confusing to understand
[13:53:26] <Nasp> Also open source is quite hostile
[13:53:34] <JakeSays> yup
[13:53:38] <alguien> Nasp, JakeSays in their defense, the guy said "soon", and closed the issue himself

[13:57:26] <alguien> JakeSays, I'm saying the guy who reported the issue closed it. The bot may be programmed to close any issues that are not worth discussing. Now they close other discussions, but in the general case when the reporter themselves closes the issue, I can see it being useful
[13:58:17] <Babbage> bahh queues dont have a nice ToString()
[13:58:25] <alguien> *close any discussions
[13:58:56] <JakeSays> Babbage: what did you expect it to do?
[13:59:50] <alguien> That said, I do agree that in general "do it yourself" is not ok. People who request features don't have the devs' know-how
[14:00:15] <Nasp> Software people have worked on for years
[14:00:21] <Nasp> Then it's not easy to just add a feature
[14:00:40] <Nasp> The feature itself might be simple to make, you just spend hours upon hours to figure out where it should be placed and hooked in

[14:11:27] <Nasp> canton7:  Well regardless most maintainers seem to make you not want to contribute
[14:12:32] <JakeSays> the guy who wrote wiringpi got fed up and took it private because of entitled pricks.
[14:13:26] <JakeSays> there was one user who pushed him over the edge. the guy demanded that the source for version 2.52 be released immediately because it was lgpl.
[14:15:57] <canton7> Nasp, they probably aren't getting decent contributions anyway, particularly not from the sorts of people who go "Could you do this big bit of work for me for free soon please? It's urgent, but I'm not willing to put any effort in!"

[14:19:34] <JakeSays> canton7: donald trump disagrees
[14:19:37] <jmer> canton7: It might just be age, but I regularly think "It didn't used to be this bad"

[14:21:58] <Nasp> I also feel like it's gotten worse
[14:22:11] <canton7> jmer, I was thinking about this the other day. Communities used to be smallish, and there were moderators who could ban people from them. That doesn't happen any more
[14:22:59] <JakeSays> canton7: banning isn't being 'inclusive'
[14:23:35] <canton7> JakeSays, depends how you define "inclusive"
[14:23:45] <jmer> canton7: Maybe... But does banning actually work? it's not like it's practiced THAT often here, is it?
[14:23:50] <Nasp> Just in here the moderating is lacking
[14:24:09] <canton7> "I included you without prejudice; I'm excluding you because you're a prick"
[14:24:46] <canton7> jmer, the ban list on Freenode was overflowing. The one here only has 3 people on it -- we seem to have lost the worst in the switch
[14:25:41] <canton7> It's not as effective as you'd like because it's so easy to evade, but in the end it just gets too annoying for trolls, so it does work in the end I think
[14:26:16] <jbe> we did tabula rasa in the emacs channel as well with the move, but the list was surprisingly short even before tbh
[14:26:26] <Nasp> Suchiman:  had used some ML on Crusher and the likes to detect peoples writing style
[14:26:33] <Nasp> That's quite the amazing idea
[14:26:52] <Nasp> Isn't ban a bit harder to evade if you set +authenticated on the channel
[14:26:58] <Nasp> Then they need to create a whole new user each time
[14:27:42] <canton7> Yeah, and we do that temporarily if it gets bad (spambots, etc)
[14:27:56] <JakeSays> hmm. wonder how effective GPT-3 would be at dickhead detection
[14:28:06] <Nasp> I dont tink that has ever happened?

[14:29:03] <Nasp> The +authenticated
[14:29:09] <JakeSays> ah
[14:29:26] <jbe> how would a transformer language model detect dickheads?

[14:31:33] <Diablo-D3> but can we automate this in a way that, you know, services the customer?
[14:32:23] <irwiss> it sorta does, people clueless in IT think it's a real person and go over the whole "what's your <some id information>? did you try turning it off and on again?..." kind of stuff

[16:05:46] <irwiss> sending anonymous letter to the headmaster seems cowardly and stupid, guess i'll have to discuss with my partner if he's willing to risk it, worst case it's not a mandatory course anyway
[16:12:22] <MatthiasVance> Actually naming a constant is a *GREAT* thing
[16:12:24] <MatthiasVance> :D
[16:12:31] <MatthiasVance> (just not with v_ in front)
[16:12:37] <MatthiasVance> It's all about semantics
[16:13:01] <MatthiasVance> I skipped the rest of the backlog though ;p
[16:13:17] <irwiss> or just use an IDE from less than a decade ago that already shows you the argument name?
[16:14:11] <irwiss> like you can manually write the argument name too, named arguments exist... just not in whatever version of C# in his brain

[16:41:15] <Tazy> Hmmm migrating from Newtonsoft.Json to System.Text.Json isn't gonna be so simple :/
[16:41:47] <irwiss> to be fair you don't have to do it at all
[16:41:52] <shadowchaser> MatthiasVance yeah, i second that, used to be all like "but ide is showing it to you and stuff", but it's kicked me in the butt few times
[16:42:28] <MatthiasVance> In this case it's school, I don't think you should "hide behind" an IDE, that's something that you use because you know what it does for you
[16:42:50] <shadowchaser> Tazy why are you doing that?
[16:42:52] <irwiss> you don't have to have the ide show it to you, you can literally write named argument, the same as you wrote a constant except it also shows you the value inline
[16:43:59] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: My point wasn't about passing it as a parameter
[16:44:07] <Tazy> shadowchaser, speed. Newtonsoft, is taking too long to serialize and deserialize
[16:44:08] <MatthiasVance> More about that it's good to define a semantic variable
[16:44:26] <irwiss> then what is your point? because that coding style specifically refers to passing as parameter
[16:44:36] <MatthiasVance> MatthiasVance> I skipped the rest of the backlog though ;p
[16:45:04] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: Maybe you should convince the person to not use boolean parameters in the first place :D
[16:45:18] <MatthiasVance> Refactoring will make this better (tm)
[16:45:19] <irwiss> i mean in general sure, a const bool meaningfulName = ... is more useful than true/false out of nowhere but that thing is specifically targeted at passing parameters
[16:47:09] <jbe> const bool notFalse = true :)
[16:47:31] <shadowchaser> Tazy ha, used to be other way around, but it was long time since i've even tried ms json
[16:48:03] <Tazy> shadowchaser, yeah currently with dotnet core it outperformance newtonsoft often by a factor of 3
[16:48:10] <shadowchaser> nice
[16:48:14] <irwiss> jbe: #define true (__LINE__ % 1000 != 0) ;)
[16:48:21] <jbe> :)
[16:48:55] <shadowchaser> i've started my current code base 5 years ago, used newtonsoft and have never looked back, but maybe i'll give it a try in my new job
[16:50:31] <Tazy> shadowchaser, check https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/Performance.htm
[16:50:43] <Tazy> unless someone has ideas on how to speed up newtonsoft?
[16:51:03] <jbe> yeah, in any new project I'll probably go with system.text.json
[16:52:05] <Tazy> so the best way for raw speed is manually serialize
[16:54:04] <irwiss> bitpack it manually in assembly for best speed

[21:52:36] <tlf> I kind of wish I could have some decent speakers in here, but the drop ceilings echo outside my room :/
[21:58:16] <TheGuestMovie> Any recommendations for an junior-to-intermediate interview question to ask a C# dev? I'm not a C# dev myself, but I'm interviewing one soon for a C++ position (they know a little C++, and I can train them), desktop application developer. I have some questions and basic problems prepared, the usual fluff, but can't really make the sort of problems
[21:58:17] <TheGuestMovie> I do in C++ (for example, intentionally badly-written programs). I figure for C# I'd go the other way and have them demonstrate familiarity with tools/BCL classes any seasoned C# dev would have, like querying an HTTP API that returns JSON, and using LINQ to filter results.
[21:59:32] <TheGuestMovie> is that too basic? alternatively, is there anything else I should try to fit in there?
[22:02:23] *** Quits: Shariff (~UserNick@starbase26.connected.by.freedominter.net) (Quit: Going offline, see ya! (www.adiirc.com))
[22:06:32] <jonp> TheGuestMovie: how much time do you have?  the more complex the question, the more time is required.
[22:06:54] <jonp> you presumably mostly want to see "do they have a clue" and "can they learn"
[22:07:08] <TheGuestMovie> I got 1 hour overall...but that includes intro and basic Linux question. But I can rapid-fire those verbally for a more meaty C# problem.
[22:07:09] <jonp> so i'd suggest a *simpler* question; "fizzbuzz" exists for a reason.
[22:07:20] <TheGuestMovie> fizzbuzz has been memorized by all candidates by now
[22:07:25] <jonp> right.
[22:07:36] <jonp> so *not* fizzbuzz, but something of similar complexity
[22:08:00] <TheGuestMovie> but at the same time, i'd expect any student to pass fizzbuzz, so it doesnt prove any of the 7 years of C# experience
[22:08:27] <jonp> therein lies the problem: there are plenty who can't pass it.
[22:08:34] <jonp> or couldn't, before memorization
[22:08:35] <TheGuestMovie> I have general questions ("how would you do X") that should indicate experience...but I would 've liked a practical example too
[22:09:06] <TheGuestMovie> For example would you say LINQ is a must know for any C# dev? That someone can't go 7 years as C# dev without learning it, if they're decent?
[22:10:05] <biberu> you'd have to work pretty hard on remaining in your own comfortable bubble to manage that
[22:10:09] <jonp> "must" know is strong; i'd *expect* them to, certainly, but if they have a good reason *not* to know LINQ…
[22:11:53] <_Shurik_> would be very strange if they didn't know it
[22:11:56] <biberu> what'd be a good reason for that? to choose not to use it you'd still have to know of it, otherwise you couldn't make an informed decision
[22:13:41] <TheGuestMovie> biberu: what else would consider high-importance for C# devs (surprising if they dont know it), similar to LINQ?
[22:14:00] <TheGuestMovie> I dont mean basic student stuff like reading/writing text files. Basically nothing they will have done in school.
[22:18:22] <biberu> TheGuestMovie: hmz, if you're going to train them for a c++ position i might discuss some problematic example involving disposable (who owns the life cycle of the object? would RAII be an obstacle?), maybe you could get something on reference types / value types in there, certainly generics
[22:19:00] *** Quits: AbleBacon_ (~AbleBacon@user/AbleBacon) (Quit: I am like MacArthur; I shall return.)
[22:25:24] <TheGuestMovie> allright thanks
[22:25:44] <TheGuestMovie> problem is learning enough C# in a short time to ask the questions :P
[22:26:01] <TheGuestMovie> but even verbal questions I think would be good on those subjects
[22:26:45] <TheGuestMovie> I wrote this for Linq: https://paste.debian.net/plain/1220437  . Should be OK?
[22:26:46] <tlf> boy, can't get enough of those interviews where the interviewer clearly is rusty on the subject
[22:27:47] <TheGuestMovie> tlf: look man, I'm meeting the guy half-way by even proposing C# questions. Basically I'm predicting that his C++ is gonna be crap, but if he's good at C# I'll consider him anyway because I figure he can be taught
[22:28:20] <TheGuestMovie> but not being good at C# myself, it's not simple to gauge his C# ability
[22:28:42] <tlf> oh, you're interviewing a c# guy for a c++ position?
[22:28:58] <biberu> TheGuestMovie: that's a lot of code you don't need, and i'd question why you want to solve that with linq, why not just use set operations?
[22:29:50] <tlf> TheGuestMovie, whats a junior c+ start out at these days?
[22:29:54] <TheGuestMovie> biberu: cause as we discussed, LINQ familiarity is the goal.
[22:29:59] <TheGuestMovie> tlf: 150k
[22:30:19] <jonp> i'm not sure *I* could answer that question as-is; i know .Join() is it, but i rarely/never use .Join()…

[22:36:01] <ap5> (some guy on redit wrote he could see it - like the contents of it)
[22:36:19] <jonp> you should ask someone w/ a GitLab account

[22:37:07] <ap5> But it is a private repo, just for me
[22:37:39] <biberu> ask the guy for proof then?
[22:37:41] <jonp> meaning you're relying on GitLab having proper protections in place
[22:37:43] <ap5> Maybe submodules behave strange when exposed through a public repo
