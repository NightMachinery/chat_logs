[00:03:59] <retro> I can do that with a small lego model but doing it with a much larger model which is supposed to have a butt ton of moving features is almost beyond whats humanly possible almost

[00:08:17] <pragma-> C does not make rapid prototyping/experimentation of ideas feasible. you must micromanage too much in C. use something like Python, Ruby, Perl or Haskell to make your idea. you'll only neer to concern yourself with your idea instead of unrelated irrelevant things like memory management and object lifetimes

[00:13:02] <pragma-> i find in general that people who are "against oop" don't really understand it and are more against the syntax rather than the semantics. such people end up writing oop-style code without even being aware of it. they pass a pointer to a struct around as the first arg and don't realize its identical to using self/this

[00:20:06] <pragma-> an oop language doesn't necessarily mean it supports evil things like operator overloading or multiple inheritance. if u hate those things, which is reasonable, then say you hate those rsther than saying you hate an entire paradigm just because some languages, like C++, take it to extremes

[00:43:48] <retro> yes
[00:43:51] <retro> i knoww

[02:52:41] <MrMobius> can you tell gcc not to use one of the registers?
[02:52:58] <twkm> use it yourself.
[02:53:41] <gl> try -fixed-reg
[02:53:56] <gl> err -ffixed-reg
[02:54:06] <gl>            Treat the register named reg as a fixed register; generated code should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame pointer or in some other fixed role).
[02:54:52] <MrMobius> perfect, ty
[02:54:58] <fizzie> You can also use the https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Global-Register-Variables.html extension.
[02:57:00] <cousteau> won't library functions possibly use that register though?
[02:57:10] <cousteau> (are we talking CPU registers?)
[02:59:17] <fizzie> Yes, you're kind of expected to recompile everything if you want to avoid that.
[03:00:30] <fizzie> From the extension's description: "Note that these points only apply to code that is compiled with the definition. The behavior of code that is merely linked in (for example code from libraries) is not affected." Followed by a note that -ffixed-/reg/ can be useful for recompiling other code since it doesn't require adding the global register declaration.

[06:21:02] <fizzie> That's a rather confusingly organized piece of code already in the original; there's some obvious attempts at making things modular (`void *closure` for the event handler, passing a `PING *` to many functions) but then there's also a plain global `extern PING *ping;` that other functions use.
[06:21:09] <fizzie> At any rate, the `struct ping_stat` might've been a lower-effort place to hang the extended statistics on, given that it's already used for statistics and propagated to the handler.
[06:21:35] <MrFantastik> yea but that is only returned when the program is SIGTERMED
[06:21:44] <MrFantastik> or some other signal is sent 
[06:21:54] <MrFantastik> where I'm trying to capture the stats on each ping
[06:22:24] <MrFantastik> and print that info (someday) in real time

[06:24:51] <MrFantastik> but I want at a given moment the last 10, 100, and 1000
[06:24:57] <MrFantastik> gnu pingh
[06:25:32] <fizzie> Yes, yes, all I'm saying is there's a _structure_ that's already holding statistics, you could have put your lists of 10, 100 and 1000 in that structure rather than inventing your own extra parameter.
[06:26:14] <fizzie> Maybe there's a reason why `struct ping_stat` is passed through the `closure` pointer rather than set as a field on the `PING` object.
[06:26:19] <fizzie> (And then again, maybe not, who knows.)
[06:26:25] <MrFantastik> for what I'm doing though it would add 9 fields to that struct
[06:26:49] <MrFantastik> where as the way I'm approaching it adds one struct with 3 fields

[06:28:52] <fizzie> Again, why would there be any difference in the number of fields you need depending on whether you add things to `struct ping_data` vs. `struct ping_stat`?

[06:38:34] <fizzie> Another thing you might want to do is add some "\n"s into that printf debugging to double-check which iteration of the loop it fails, since all the valgrind report can show it's one of them. (Or catch it "live" with a regular debugger.)
[06:39:12] <fizzie> ...actually, I do see the problem there.
[06:39:35] <fizzie> https://gitlab.com/reedrichards/mynettools/-/blob/master/ping/ping_echo.c#L84 <- that can't possibly set any value to `last_10_pings`, because the value is local to the function.
[06:40:17] <fizzie> And https://gitlab.com/reedrichards/mynettools/-/blob/master/ping/ping_common.c#L375 <- that `malloc` result is never going to get outside that function call.
[06:40:41] <MrFantastik> because it allocates to the stack
[06:40:48] <MrFantastik> ?
[06:41:00] <fizzie> The value of `last_n_pings` is private to the function.
[06:41:10] <fizzie> Setting it to something won't have any effect outside it.
[06:41:21] <MrFantastik> i see
[06:41:30] <fizzie> What you'd generally do is to return the newly allocated pointer. Or pass in a `PACKET_LOSS_STATS **`, but given the function has nothing else to return...

[06:43:10] <MrFantastik> if i return a malloced struct from a function its not going to be deallocated?
[06:43:44] <fizzie> Allocated storage is... allocated. Its lifetime is until the same pointer is passed to `free` (if ever).
[06:44:48] <MrFantastik> slightly off topic, if i never free storage, and the program terminates, is that memory block now "dead"?
[06:45:02] <MrFantastik> as in nothing will be able to use it again?
[06:45:14] <MrFantastik> until a reboot or something 
[06:48:04] <fizzie> Any reasonable general-purpose operating system will reclaim all memory given to a process when that process terminates.
[06:48:53] <fizzie> On some microcontrollers you might "permanently" (until the next reset) lose memory though.

[12:25:53] <dave0> can't trust compilers these days
[12:26:09] <dave0> slightest bug and the compiler shoots to kill
[12:34:07] <ent58> I have a curiosity about how compilers generate this code: https://bpa.st/PQ7Q
[12:34:07] <ent58> I know how to fix what the apparent UB is (check if the modulus is not zero before dividing), but what in this instance gives the compiler the right to assume it's UB? trying this in godbolt with full optimization forces it to emit a 'UD2' in main and halt abruptly without even trying the computation
[12:34:08] <ent58> If it's clear why the compiler is allowed to force me to check, I'd love to know (it could be that I've already validated it elsewhere, and in this case it can "see" that the result will not be zero)

This is the program: https://clbin.com/fl1rC . This is the output of an interaction with it: https://clbin.com/v3G93 ... why is the largest number 100.620003 and not 100.62? iirc converting from binary to denary can have problems like irrational numbers in the binary 
[17:27:50] <not_a_robot06> number system (just like how we have irrational numbers in the denary, that may be rational in other number systems), but how do I solve this problem?

[17:31:33] <not_a_robot06> well, is this problem unsolvable? the book has this exact same interaction in it to demonstrate what the program is supposed to do, and the largest number isn't 100.620003, but 100.62
[17:32:12] <fizzie> As for "solutions", you could keep your numbers decimal (matches human expectations better), you could print with less precision, you could even in practice just use the `double` type which typically has enough precision for that problem not to occur for that input given %f's default precision (6 decimal digits).

[17:33:53] <fizzie> Of course even a `double` is still not going to be _exactly_ 100.62.
[17:34:13] <fizzie> ,cc float f = 100.62; double d = 100.62; printf("%.30f %.30f", f, d); // it's just closer

[17:34:34] <not_a_robot06> fizzie: the exercise book specifically says that "the numbers aren't necessarily integers", and doesn't talk about double (yet?). The book was written for C99, and I *am* compiling with -std=c99, so idk if I'm missing something or not.
[17:35:11] <not_a_robot06> oh well, it was just a minor annoyance, not exactly a "problem".
[17:35:25] <fizzie> It's odd to talk about `float` rather than `double`, since the latter is in some sense the "default" floating-point type.

[17:36:00] <fizzie> The floating-point constant `123.45` has the type `double`, in variadic functions all arguments of type `float` are automatically promoted to `double`.
[17:36:17] <not_a_robot06> huh
[17:36:32] <fizzie> (Even in a call like `float f = 12.34f; printf("%f", f);` what's happening is `f` gets promoted to `double`.)
[17:36:40] <not_a_robot06> so if float is always "converted" to double, why is float and double still co-existing?

[17:39:53] <fizzie> I guess one more way in which `double` is the default is, for <math.h> functions the variant for doubles is the one that has nothing extra in the name (like `double sin(double x);`), while the others have suffixes (`float sinf(float x);` and `long double sinl(long double x);`).

[18:29:51] <GyrosGeier> that is the same hardware resource

[18:30:19] <Xgc> jan_: It can certainly be faster, but not necessarily.
[18:30:26] <GyrosGeier> it might still be faster because the OS knows that it needs to read all the files
[18:30:48] <GyrosGeier> so it can order the accesses to reduce the number of head movements

[18:42:57] <Learath2> It all depends on the phase of the moon
[18:43:05] <jan_> so the problem is on the side of sqlite
[18:43:31] <clarity> Yes and no
[18:43:40] <Learath2> sqlite is indeed not very conducive to threading
[18:43:51] <clarity> But also your program is at fault for blocking on it
[18:43:53] <Xgc> jan_: Case in point, on a very old system, with a single processor (1 core, no separate threads), in a multitasking system, I was still able to schedule head seeks of a multi-platter drive system and improve performance significantly. This is in a system with just the one processing unit.

[18:48:17] <ioxzev1z> aiui threads are much lighter than processes
[18:48:32] <ioxzev1z> They also share resources/etc
[18:49:34] <ioxzev1z> Therefore switching between threads is in theory easier than switching between processes
[18:49:39] <Xgc> That's right.  Even with one cpu (no hardware threads), the ability to schedule, interrupt, get pending work done while some software threads are waiting, can be a huge advantage.  Without those software threads (within one program) we often end up serializing operations that do not need to be serialized.

[18:53:11] <jan_> do you think inserting multiple results of my processed files (e.g. in groups of 10) will be faster than doing it every time I have new result? So in theory threads will block only when im doing this big write instead of multiple times for every new result
[18:54:35] <ioxzev1z> Assuming by "threads" that you have a thread pool, so just add to queue when you want work done, possibly gather in groups before adding to said queue
[18:54:56] <Learath2> Only profiling will tell you the answer, but it could indeed be faster
[18:55:31] <Learath2> Maybe you could avoid blocking the processing threads at all if the results don't have to be inserted for the new tasks to continue

[18:58:35] <Xgc> jan_: With sqlite, you can probably measure the best case time by just logging the SQL requests your entire program generates and then process them outside of your program, in sqlite directly.  That will probably give you the best case time possible, understanding that sqlite requires locking of the database on these writes.
[18:58:39] <ioxzev1z> Writes are also buffered, no? So even if you call write a thousand times, that doesn't necessarily mean you're writing a thousand times to disk.

[20:28:48] <OverCoder> apparently /usr/include/libpq-fe.h
[20:29:01] <sham1> Or alternatively, does the library have pkg-config since those are actually linker issues

[22:08:32] <ioxzev1z> twkm, the purpose of the questions is to see which canidate has memorized the "C language questions in an interview and how to answer them" book

[22:14:32] <cousteau> yeah I've memorized that algorithm too
[22:15:06] <cousteau> trenka: why though?  I think C has everything a modern language has, while not being too permissive
[22:15:08] <ioxzev1z> cousteau, I think the requirement is "the fewest times"
[22:16:05] <trenka> cousteau: because with pascal you can concentrate on programming, not on the language itself. C is hard for real beginners in the area
[22:16:06] <cousteau> learning Pascal was pretty much a waste of time.  Learning C has been useful in the future, both for programming embedded systems and participating in real life projects, and it's a gateway drug to C++ and many other C-like languages
[22:16:34] <cousteau> as for an easy to use language, I'd much rather use Python.  Also more used nowadays.
[22:16:35] <trenka> there is no problem to learn a language
[22:16:50] <trenka> python is is better, yes
[22:17:02] <trenka> in my time there was no python
[22:17:28] <Kit> i first learnt programming with BASIC
[22:17:34] <|smlckz|> i remember someone saying that C is a one-person language, a person can individually learn a vast amount of C, compared to shiny languages of today..
[22:17:34] <trenka> #metoo
[22:17:57] <cousteau> I guess it depends what you're teaching.  In my field (engineering) it makes sense to teach C as the first language because you don't just want to teach programming in general, but also the little strict things in programming, and some "low level" point of view

[22:20:10] <trenka> and Java is bad for studing programming as well

[22:20:48] <Kit> i think C is a great lang to start *understanding* programming, but not really a good introductory language
[22:21:07] <trenka> yes, I agree
[22:21:07] <Kit> it teaches you concepts like memory, types, etc.
[22:21:12] <cousteau> so if you want to learn to write quick and dirty scripts that do things, Python is OK, but if the goal is to learn programming in general, C might be a better first language
[22:21:17] <trenka> every programmer should know C at some point
[22:21:22] <Kit> but its too low-level for a beginner

[23:19:39] <SamuelMarks> libc-dev
[23:20:44] <twkm> <stddef.h> is a required header, if your implementation cannot find it there's a problem.  what exactly i cannot say -- i don't use either of those systems.
[23:21:23] <SamuelMarks> Yeah I mean it's been around since [at least] C89
[23:21:31] <twkm> (technically there doesn't have to be a file, the compiler can presume the content, though that's somewhat unusual)
[23:21:48] <SamuelMarks> I'm building an LLVM dependant project
[23:23:17] <trenka> SamuelMarks: debian based distributions have apt-file if you want to search. In my chrrot /usr/include/linux/stddef.h is in linux-libc-dev
[23:23:30] <NRK[m]> did u fetch the compiler from official repo or? i had similar error when trying to invoke tcc directly without running "make install"
[23:23:35] <trenka> SamuelMarks: and it's not a C question :)
[23:23:39] <twkm> you're installing gcc to develop an llvm project ... weird.

[23:35:19] <cousteau> that's the only reason I can think of
