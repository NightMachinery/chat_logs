[00:47:39] <lispmacs[work]> codecolla: yes, running free-software on non-free hardware does not violate the free software licensing

[15:34:32] <DiffieHellman> xx: Provided such is the same version of the licence you can just copy it over - formatting and the address doesn't change the licence.
[15:34:54] <xx> it is still the same version number, yes
[15:35:10] <DiffieHellman> You only need to contact them all if you want to upgrade the licence - say from GPLv2 to GPLv2+
[15:36:06] <DiffieHellman> for example
[15:36:16] <xx> so if a contributor says they "Don't agree that the links should be upgraded to https, because it prevents access for those without https connectivity" then I can tell the contributor to get lost, right?
[15:36:36] <DiffieHellman> Yes.
[15:36:46] <xx> perfect, thanks
[15:37:42] <clever> the trend of https taking over has caused problems for me in the past, when i needed to get win xp online (long story), and every single site has both banned http, and banned ssl2 (downgrade exploits)
[15:39:28] <clever> but thats less of a problem of whats in the docs, and more of how the servers are configured to redirect automatically
[15:40:06] <DiffieHellman> Don't use that piece of proprietary malware then? http://www.netsurf-browser.org/downloads/windows/ should work on windows XP I'm pretty sure
[15:40:50] <clever> DiffieHellman: i was needing to use some active x components at the time
[15:41:16] <DiffieHellman> First point x2
[15:41:18] <clever> and for unknown reasons, half of the functionality only worked under XP, and half only worked under win7

[15:43:21] <DiffieHellman> clever: Probably, but not easily as of course no-one actually documents their hardware as you know extensively.
[15:43:25] <kilobug> connecting to old IPMI hardware can be very hellish indeed
[15:43:30] <clever> DiffieHellman: exactly

[15:44:38] <clever> even the open software i tried using at the time was giving me its own share of problems
[15:44:47] <kilobug> I had to run ancient versions of firefox with ancient versions of JVM inside a VM/docker in order to access old IPMI hardware once...
[15:44:50] <clever> i was trying to use an ubuntu livecd to install an os on the machine
[15:45:02] <clever> and ubuntu was being "helpful" and ejecting itself from the tray on every reboot
[15:45:22] <clever> and the tray cant close itself, so i have to file a support ticket, asking somebody on the other side of the globe to push the tray back in :P
[15:45:50] <kilobug> clever: lots of fun :) hope you weren't billed per support ticket...
[15:45:59] <clever> thats what pushed me to just using the virtual cdrom stuff in the IPMI
[15:46:36] <kilobug> our former datacenter was billing us $100 per support ticket (and like $250 per urgent support ticket) even if it was just pressing a button
[15:46:59] <clever> this datacenter wasnt charging per ticket any
[15:47:06] <clever> but those tickets revealed some rather jaring facts
[15:47:15] <clever> like, the linux vm's are all virtualbox under windows, lol
[15:47:24] <kilobug> oh :(
[15:47:30] <clever> when i asked for a screenshot of the boot error, i got a PHOTO of a MONITOR
[15:47:34] <iShareFreedom> Want to make a datacenter with free software? clever?

[15:48:19] <clever> iShareFreedom: vpsfree.cz
[15:48:20] <kilobug> I always handled the full software stack, so either xen or qemu/kvm based, but never any non-free solution like Virtualbox or VMWare
[15:48:50] <clever> kilobug: this datacenter also didnt have ipmi enabled, so any reboot requests, had to be handled manually
[15:49:05] <clever> they had to plug it in and configure an IP before i could even use it

[15:49:34] <iShareFreedom> you say linux about kernel or are you asking about gnu with linux kernel? DeffieHellman
[15:49:49] <clever> DiffieHellman: once i realized what they where doing, i just skipped trying to install an os remotely, and i just shipped them a vbox disk image of the right size

[15:50:43] <DiffieHellman> Yes it's quite nice to be able to make virtual machine images

[15:52:50] <clever> also, for that datacenter, VM's all need a manually configured static ip
[15:53:01] <clever> after i gave them the disk image, they asked for the root pw, so they could configure it
[15:53:16] <clever> then they said nevermind, when they realized it was already online, i had planned ahead :P
[15:54:05] <DiffieHellman> I do dislike when someone asks me for the password.
[15:54:25] <clever> even if they did have the pw, they dont know how to configure a static ip on nixos
[15:54:48] <DiffieHellman> Bad security practice and it's hard to read out 15+ random chars
[15:55:00] <clever> yeah
[15:55:53] <kilobug> I usually don't have any root password on VMs, we connect using normal user accounts with ssh keys and then we use sudo, core admins have full sudo access, other users just sudo access to a few commands
[15:56:05] <clever> yep
[15:57:20] <clever> for the baremetal machines at that DC, they instead get a public ip via dhcp
[15:57:33] <clever> and randomly, it will malfunction, and give you a private ip instead, that still has internet access
[15:57:50] <kilobug> on physical hosts we do have root passwords, can be useful in some case for disaster recovery, the passwords are kept in a GPG-encrypted file that we basically never use (since disasters don't occur often)
[15:57:50] <DiffieHellman> IPv4 only?
[15:57:51] <clever> thanks to a vpn i had installed, i was able to still get back into the machine and discover that

[15:58:24] <clever> kilobug: grub can bypass passwords anyways
[15:58:26] <DiffieHellman> clever: Was it NAT or?
[15:58:34] <kilobug> clever: yeah, init=/bin/sh
[15:58:41] <clever> DiffieHellman: NAT only if the dhcp randomly gave you a private ip
[15:58:59] <clever> both public and private ip's on the same physical network...

[16:01:13] <clever> kilobug: having seen all of that, id say that DC was pretty low security...

[16:05:57] <kreyren[m]> <clever> "iShareFreedom: vpsfree.cz" <- thanks 
[16:06:16] <clever> DiffieHellman: oh, and on the subject of vlans, my home fiber modem, has VLAN's coming out of the only active ethernet port
[16:07:13] <clever> DiffieHellman: one vlan is for public internet, dhcp gets you a public ip, NAT away, your done
[16:07:43] <clever> one vlan is for tv service, dhcp gets you a 10.x.y.z ip, now you need to NAT with 2 uplinks, and handle multicast routing, and then you get tv service
[16:07:44] <DiffieHellman> I need to send packets over a specific VLAN to get internet for some reason too, same.
[16:07:59] <clever> one more vlan, is BRIDGED into the PRIVATE lan by the stock router
[16:08:06] <DiffieHellman> Damn
[16:08:07] <clever> so the ISP can route that vlan to a VM, and the VM is effectively on the inside of my firewall
[16:08:38] <clever> there is zero documentation on that whole mess, so if you replace the stock router, you loose tv service
[16:09:30] <DiffieHellman> Somewhat the same in my case aside from the tester guy mentioning the VLAN I needed to use.
[16:09:37] <clever> but i discovered thru trial&error, that if you set the official router to pppoe mode, it spits pppoe packets out the internet vlan
[16:09:44] <clever> the isp ignores those
[16:09:50] <clever> so you can then run 2 routers on the same modem
[16:10:02] <clever> the official router, only has the tv vlan working, so tv service 80% works
[16:10:13] <clever> the custom router gets the internet vlan
[16:10:31] <clever> then you must run pppoe-server, aimed out the internet vlan port, to accept connections from the official router
[16:10:43] <DiffieHellman> The installing documentation actually tells you to just plug it in. I suspect the original thing did DHCP, but they changed things...
[16:10:44] <clever> because if the official router lacks internet access, the guide in the cable box breaks :P

[16:14:10] <clever> the only part that really followed standards, was how the video itself got streamed
[16:14:23] <clever> h264+aac in mpegts in rtp in udp over multicast
[16:14:37] <clever> with the standard mpegts crypto stuff
[16:14:46] <DiffieHellman> Only because that's the only way you get an image?
[16:15:02] <clever> DiffieHellman: well, it did have a secondary streaming method :P
[16:15:28] <clever> when you change channels, it initially streams over tcp, to get an instant keyframe from an encoder, and fast tuning
[16:15:40] *** Quits: fef (~thedawn@user/thedawn) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:15:49] <clever> then it will seamlessly switch over to the multicast stream, when the many gateways kick into gear and begin sending that
[16:16:03] <clever> this fact, makes debugging your multicast configuration a pain
[16:16:05] *** Joins: fef (~thedawn@user/thedawn)
[16:16:13] <clever> because it cheats, and ignores multicast for the first minute :P
[16:17:21] <DiffieHellman> I wonder if my multicast configuration works. Should work out of the box.
[16:18:16] <DiffieHellman> Don't stream video or use RIPv2 so I'm not sure if I've managed to use it.
[16:18:20] <clever> i have yet to find a configuration that actually works, when crossing over a NAT
[16:19:34] <DiffieHellman> NAT breaks everything, so that's not surprising. It's saw we have got to the stage where 90% of setups are NAT.
[16:20:17] <clever> for my isp, the first mac to do a dhcp request, will get a public ip
[16:20:29] <clever> once done, that mac owns the link, and all further dhcp requests are silently ignored
[16:20:59] <clever> if you want to change routers, you must either release the dhcp lease first, or spoof the mac of the previous one, or wait a few hours for it to expire
[16:21:10] <DiffieHellman> I got 1 IPv4 address and no IPv6, so just NAT for me.
[16:21:27] <clever> oh yeah, and there is closed firmware i cant do anything about
[16:21:33] <clever> the "modem" is technically an entire router
[16:21:39] <clever> 1 fiber in, 2 phone out, 4 ethernet out
[16:21:48] <clever> but it lacked wifi and HPNA
[16:21:52] <clever> so the isp neutered it
[16:22:03] <clever> only 1 phone and 1 ethernet port work, and there is zero way to access its config
[16:22:32] <clever> and even then, i have discovered hidden features in it
[16:22:52] <clever> that "modem" has an attached 12v battery and charger, to act as a UPS (since it also deals with 911 service)
[16:23:03] <clever> if the battery gets to half charge, the ethernet port stops working
[16:23:56] <DiffieHellman> Intentional or?
[16:24:02] <clever> likely intentional
[16:24:09] <clever> 911 service is more important then internet
[16:24:20] <clever> so when the battery gets weak, it disables internet service
[16:24:26] <clever> to keep the 911 service alive
[16:26:01] <clever> DiffieHellman: i only discovered that, when i had a 2 day power outage, and i was running a router off 1 UPS, and leaving the "modem" to run off its own internal UPS
[16:26:02] <DiffieHellman> Still, that should take a while as ethernet signaling shouldn't be that intensive.
[16:26:19] <DiffieHellman> 2 days is pretty good.
[16:26:33] <clever> ethernet, plus fiber-optic, plus powering regular old pots phones
[16:27:02] <clever> near the end of that outage, i had to plus the "modem" UPS into the other UPS, to trick it into thinking power was back
[16:27:12] <clever> and then i had to get a big inverter out, and rig it up to a car
[16:29:22] <clever> since then, i have discovered the youtube channel for a lineman in this province
[16:29:32] <clever> so i can now see how the electrical grid is being maintained
