[00:22:57] <crumpo> Hmm, does cl-sdl2 define a value for SDL_WINDOWEVENT_RESIZED?
[00:23:49] <crumpo> ah it's in the spec

[00:36:26] <artchad> there seems to be a keyword :windowevent
[00:37:34] <artchad> but I don't know how I would get the event.type
[00:37:45] <artchad> event->type
[00:40:43] <crumpo> I think you want event->window.event, assuming event is an SDL_Event* pointing to a valid SDL_WindowEvent
[00:41:01] <crumpo> (on the C/C++ side of things that is; I'm still noobing my way around lisp tbh)
[00:42:16] <crumpo> I'm not sure how it translates to cl in this case though
[00:42:23] <artchad> I'm noobing my way through API, that don't have examples.
[00:42:33] <crumpo> :D
[00:42:46] <crumpo> Do you have some code I can poke around in?
[00:43:00] <crumpo> I'm quite comfortable with SDL so maybe I can help \_o_/
[00:43:45] <artchad> uhhh
[00:44:13] <artchad> https://codeberg.org/artchad/cl-opengl-tutorial-ported-to-sdl2
[00:44:21] <artchad> textures-4.lisp
[00:45:44] <artchad> You an just quickload it and (in-package :textures-4)
[00:45:46] <artchad> then (start)
[00:51:14] <crumpo> hmm, remind me how I can quickload a file :/
[00:51:32] <crumpo> I've been playing with chicken scheme lately and forgotten everything I thought I knew about CL ;_:
[00:52:35] <dlowe> (ql:quickload "system-name")
[00:53:01] <crumpo> Oh, I see, download it and quickload
[00:53:47] <crumpo> Thanks
[00:57:52] <dlowe> quickloading downloads it
[00:58:02] <dlowe> and all its dependencies
[00:58:09] <crumpo> Oh
[00:58:57] <dlowe> if you want to load a single file, you can just (load "filename")
[00:59:16] <artchad> the dependencies won't be loaded though if you just load the file
[00:59:52] <artchad> I would have to add quicklisp calls or require statements at the top of each file for that to work.
[01:02:57] <crumpo> So in this case should (ql:quickload "https://codeberg.org/artchad/cl-opengl-tutorial-ported-to-sdl2/src/branch/master/textures-4.lisp") just work?
[01:03:22] <crumpo> I get system-not-found errors when trying that
[01:05:36] <artchad> you do (ql:quickload :sdl2-opengl-playground
[01:05:49] <artchad> there is usually an .asd file at a projects root
[01:06:39] <artchad> you can go into that and see what the name of the system you want to load is. (usually it's the same as the file name. Sometimes the name has a suffix, which is the name of a subdirectory or so.)
[01:07:09] <crumpo> Ah, thanks. I appreciate the patience :)
