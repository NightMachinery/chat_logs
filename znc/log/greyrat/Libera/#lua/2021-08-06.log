[12:48:17] <tumn> andreyorst: that's not arity dispatching
[12:48:20] <tumn> lua has no such feature
[12:48:31] <andreyorst> why not?
[12:48:37] <andreyorst> it is exactly arity dispatching
[12:48:37] <tumn> it doesn't need it
[12:49:49] <andreyorst> every language needs arity dispatching :)
[12:50:07] <tumn> I cant think of a single practical use for it in lua
[12:50:45] <andreyorst> that just means that you don't need it, that's it
[12:51:30] <tumn> the example u gave could be replaced with function(...) local sum = 0 for _,v in pairs({...}) do sum = sum + 1 end return sum end
[12:51:56] <andreyorst> of course it can, that's just example implementation of manual arity dispatch
[12:53:20] <tumn> it's just a bad pattern for lua
[12:53:25] <tumn> I would wrinkle my nose if I saw it
[12:55:47] <tumn> like imagine calling a function and passing the result of another function call for the arguments, and it's a function that returns additional values after the expected one (like in the case of string.find), and the function has a different behavior because of that... it's risky, can't predict how many arguments are going to be passed sometimes
[12:55:47] <tumn> when lua doesn't make it strict
[12:56:23] <tumn> if there needs to be different behavior I would totally just make N functions
[12:56:36] <andreyorst> yeah, that's just an example of a bad design in lua regarding multivalues
[12:57:58] <tumn> it's not lua having bad design, it's just a case of a pattern (artiy dispatch) not working with the language 
[12:58:20] <tumn> some languages are just meant to be used in certain ways
[13:01:17] <andreyorst> well, if Lua had proper semantics regarding multiple values, it would not be a problem
[13:02:06] <andreyorst> multi-values are not first class data structure unfortunatelly, which results in lots of problems, and arity dispatch is just one of the features that can suffer from it
[13:02:30] <tumn> what would an example of proper semantics be?
[13:02:41] <tumn> in lua everything is a first class object, even functions themselves
[13:02:45] <tumn> it's just the way it's designed
[13:02:46] <andreyorst> IDK, maybe like in common lisp
[13:02:57] <tumn> lisp is a functional language though
[13:03:03] <andreyorst> no it's not
[13:03:21] <tumn> is it not?
[13:03:21] <andreyorst> it's a metaprogramming language, but not more functional than lua is
[13:03:31] <tumn> lua isn't functional at all
[13:03:37] <andreyorst> and so is lisp
[13:04:04] <tumn> lua's handling of varargs is part of why I like it so much
[13:04:23] <tumn> I dont see any problem with it
[13:04:44] <andreyorst> just because you don't see something it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, you know :)
[13:05:13] <tumn> trying to shoehorn some obscure specific thing like arity dispatch in a language that doesn't support it is exclusively a programmer problem
[13:05:23] <tumn> it's like people who try to make lua have classes
[13:06:00] <tumn> it's blaming the language when they should just use a different language
[13:06:25] <andreyorst> well, that's not quite what I'm meaning when I'm saying that varargs are poorly implemented
[13:06:37] <rjek> Like people coming in here bitching about 1-based arrays and lack of braces: you know where JavaScript is if you want it
[13:07:12] *** woodbergen is now known as woodberge
[13:07:13] <tumn> what is the problem with varargs (aside from the arity dispatch tihng)
[13:07:37] <andreyorst> it's of fixed maximum capacity, for example
[13:07:57] <rjek> Simply call your function using braces instead of brackets
[13:08:03] <andreyorst> or that you can't store it without using table.pack or wrapping it in {} and loosing nils
[13:08:36] <andreyorst> or that if it is followed by a non a vararg it will only pass it's first arg
[13:08:43] <tumn> {} doesn't lose nils
[13:09:05] <tumn> afaik the maximum capacity is just the upvalue limit
[13:09:06] <andreyorst> yeah, but there's no way to know it's size to determine how many nils there were in the tail
[13:09:18] <andreyorst> when it does matter
[13:09:21] <furq> or in the middle
[13:09:24] <tumn> select("#", ...) determines its size
[13:09:40] <no-n> dog howling outside
[13:09:45] <tumn> it's rarely necessary but it's there
[13:10:13] <tumn> local stuff = {n = select("#", ...), ...)
[13:10:27] <tumn> I think that's how table.pack works in newer versions
[13:10:44] <andreyorst> so you argee it's not implemented properly since it needs table pack :)
[13:11:02] <tumn> I don't see how that's a problem
[13:11:09] <tumn> table.pack is just the way u do it
[13:11:14] <furq> how do you define properly
[13:11:20] <andreyorst> oh there are plenty of problems with that
[13:11:37] <tumn> for example?
[13:11:51] <andreyorst> for example, when you need to make a wrapper for a function, that does things around function call you basically have to pack the result of a function, and unpack it in return
[13:12:28] <tumn> in most cases u can just do function(f, ...) f(...) end
[13:12:40] <andreyorst> function wrap (f) do_side_effects1() local res = table.pack(f()) do_side_effects2() return table.unpack(res, 1, res.n) end
[13:13:10] <andreyorst> otherwise you'll lose multiargs because you don't know how many values f returns
[13:13:21] <andreyorst> s/multiargs/multivals/
[13:13:54] <tumn> just wrapping in {} is just fine
[13:13:56] <tumn> then calling unpack
[13:14:00] <tumn> it will be identical
[13:14:05] <andreyorst> no, it's not
[13:14:40] <tumn> ah yea it's not
[13:14:42] <tumn> especially not in lua 5.1
[13:14:45] * rjek preferred #lua when it was just furq and Habbie talking about chairs.
[13:15:02] <no-n> shame cmtptr couldn't make it :(
[13:15:06] <furq> lol
[13:15:09] <furq> is he still on freenode

[13:15:19] <no-n> I'm not there anymore
[13:15:22] <furq> he probably is
[13:16:14] <rjek> He's an odd cookie.
[13:18:06] <no-n> mmm
[13:18:18] <no-n> I don't see what's wrong with calling table.pack and table.unpack a few times
[13:18:21] <rjek> https://netsplit.de/networks/top10.php - have they just stopped bothering to measure freenode?
[13:18:24] <no-n> when you have to
[13:18:54] <tumn> me either honestly
[13:19:03] <rjek> "Andrew Lee of Joseon of the freenode autonomous zone" his delusions are wonderful
[13:19:27] <no-n> what about pissnet
[13:19:41] <no-n> I think netsplit is tryiing to ignore it
[13:20:04] <no-n> ouch
[13:20:07] <no-n> that graph
[13:20:42] <no-n> Lee will look at that graph and say "fake news!"
[13:22:51] <tumn> it could be cool if lua ... was a type
[13:23:01] <tumn> local args = ...
[13:23:04] <tumn> type(args) --vararg
[13:23:44] <tumn> might get complicated with indexing and returning it though
[13:23:49] <tumn> I can see why they didnt take that approach
[13:23:59] <tumn> with tables already existing
[13:24:44] <tumn> u can kinda make a vararg container by just having a coroutine that loops and yields forever passing its varargs to coroutine.yield
[13:25:16] <tumn> I'm not sure what the use for that would be but it's certainly cool
[13:25:34] * rjek wonders how much time and electricity tumn saves by foregoing the "yo" in "you"
[13:26:10] <[Sim]> morning! can I ask a question regarding the http module and tls? I'm having trouble getting tls to handshake and I find all sorts of references to openssl and parameters to tweak but no idea how to do that in lua
[13:26:27] <[Sim]> and #lua-support is awfully quiet :-)
[13:26:47] *** Quits: GNUHacker (~foobar@fsf/member/GNUHacker) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:26:55] <[Sim]> I get the response/error: "ssl handshake error: tlsv1 alert internal error"
[13:27:09] <[Sim]> from background reading I get the idea this is caused by something in openssl, so I've checked that I have recent versions of that and also that the host I'm reaching out to is running a recent stack with tls 1.3
[13:27:19] <rjek> I can't answer your question, but the person who can will probably ask "which http module?"
[13:27:39] <[Sim]> for context, I'm running this particular lua script as a module in prosody
[13:27:56] <tumn> is it luasocket+luasec?
