[19:39:56] <mparillo> The site looks pretty much identical on Konqueror, Falkon, and Qutebrowser for me. So it might be qt5-webengine and not Qutebrowser.
[19:41:37] <nimaje> and those "margin: 0" seem suspicious too
[19:42:02] <oats> mparillo, you're not using webengine?

[19:43:04] <oats> nope, weird with webkit here too
[19:43:29] <Ingvix> I think they just meant it's not qb specific issue
[19:43:38] <mparillo> They all use qt5-webengine for me (though Qutebrowser gets it via python-pyqtwebengine)
[19:44:33] <mparillo> Exactly. If three different browsers that depend on qt5-webengine exhibit the same behavior, I assume it is not related to code specifically in Qutebrowser.

[20:19:53] <Samsonite[m]> My issue is that I can't view the top row nor column headers in Collabora online (inside of NextCloud)
[20:20:06] <Samsonite[m]> In Firefox I can see them no problem

[20:23:12] <Ingvix> okay, I'm out of ideas
[20:23:39] <Samsonite[m]> I suppose this could be a Collabora issue, but I checked their github issues page and didn't see anybody else mentioning it
[20:24:24] <Ingvix> is there some instance I could test it if it looks okay on a newer qb?
[20:24:55] <Samsonite[m]> Yea sure I can send you a link to a public doc

[23:33:35] <Ingvix> theme may still be occasions when white background happens to flash but most of the time it seems to work
[23:34:08] *** Quits: ktprograms (~ktprogram@14.192.216.70) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[23:35:09] <Ingvix> s/m/r
[23:36:22] <jmcantrell> ok
[23:36:24] <jmcantrell> thanks
[23:36:30] *** Joins: ktprograms (~ktprogram@14.192.221.245)
[23:38:21] <jmcantrell> much better :)
[23:38:53] <jmcantrell> is there a way to start a new instance even when another is running?
[23:39:48] <Ingvix> jmcantrell, use a different --basedir
[23:39:58] <Ingvix> or -T
[23:40:09] <Ingvix> as in --temp-basedir
[23:40:51] <jmcantrell> ah, thanks
[23:42:40] <jmcantrell> what's the default base dir?
[23:43:42] <Ingvix> you can see your basedir in :version
[23:43:48] <Ingvix> after data:
[23:44:17] <Ingvix> probably .local/share/qutebrowser if you're on linux
[23:46:01] <Ingvix> in your ~/, that is
[23:48:04] <jmcantrell> why does my config not seem to apply when using -T? i thought that just dealt with session data. even manually setting it with -C doesn't seem to do anything
[23:48:57] <Ingvix> are you using config.py?
[23:49:01] <Ingvix> it only works for that
[23:50:22] <Ingvix> though it might be that temp-basedir doesn't accept static configuration
[23:50:47] <The-Compiler> jmcantrell: a basedir is config + data + cache
[23:50:53] <jmcantrell> well, it does config.load_autoconfig()
[23:51:20] <jmcantrell> why isn't the config data in the basedir? it's in two different locations
[23:53:27] <jmcantrell> hmmm. if you set a basedir, how would it know where to look for stuff not typically in XDG_DATA_HOME?
[23:54:11] <Ingvix> all the stuff is in the basedir
[23:55:12] <The-Compiler> jmcantrell: a basedir has everything which would normally be in the XDG config/data/cache dirs
[23:56:09] <jmcantrell> so by default it's in the various xdg dirs, but if overridden with -B or -T, it's all in one place?
[23:56:20] <Ingvix> yes
[23:56:23] <Ingvix> also, if you need just a temporary instance with your current config, opening a private window could also work
[23:56:29] <jmcantrell> ok
[23:58:09] <The-Compiler> jmcantrell: indeed - there is --config-py as an override for config.py because that's something qutebrowser never writes to, so it can easily be shared.
