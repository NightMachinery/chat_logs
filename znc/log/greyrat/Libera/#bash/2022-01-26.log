[04:43:53] <tirnanog> it would be "perfect" but does not seem "good"? you might consider rephrasing the premise.
[04:44:06] <texasmynsted> sorry.
[04:44:23] <texasmynsted> An associative array seems like the best fit for the data.
[04:44:37] <tirnanog> I mean, if it's just key value pairs, you could build an associative array by reading them in from somewhere.

[06:07:41] <greycat> Well, imagine you have two programs written in C.  One of them defines an array, and then calls the other program.  Do you expect the second program to receive a copy of the first program's array variable?  Its heap?  Other resources?
[06:08:37] <texasmynsted> This is not C
[06:09:18] <llua> its basic unix behavior.
[06:09:31] <texasmynsted> If I can pass a string, or export a string variable, why not an array?
[06:10:32] <wiscii> my idea was obviously flawed
[06:10:33] <phy1729> Because Unix is built on strings
[06:11:02] <phy1729> the environment isn't a dictionary, it's a bunch of strings that by convention have a = in them
[06:11:05] <e36freak> exporting a function is a massive hack that bash does, it stores the function as an escaped string and reparses it
[06:11:32] <texasmynsted> so why not a serialization or marshaling format?

[13:19:19] <eoli3n> Hi
[13:20:17] <eoli3n> when i run fwupd interactivly, when there is a firmware update, it automatically ask for a reboot at the end of the process
[13:20:30] <eoli3n> when i run the command in a script, it doesn't ask for a reboot
[13:20:48] <eoli3n> i tried to run my script with "bash -i", but it didn't solve it
[13:20:50] <Soliton> probably checks if stdout is a terminal.
[13:20:59] <eoli3n> is there a way to fake it ?
[13:21:05] <eoli3n> by setting any var or something ?

[13:53:32] <Soliton> you'll have to figure out what that program bases its decision on or if it's just buggy or whatever.
[13:53:53] <Soliton> or you could just reboot yourself.
[13:54:06] <eoli3n> no i can't, because i need to reboot only if there is any update
[13:54:22] <eoli3n> if i reboot without conditionate it, i will ALWAYS reboot before install = never install
[13:54:34] <eoli3n> but i can't parse get-update output
[13:54:44] <eoli3n> because even when there isn't any update, it's verbose
[13:54:53] <eoli3n> and I can't determine all output cases
[13:55:07] <eoli3n> so the only way to reboot only if necessary is to rely on fwupd
[13:55:12] <Soliton> sounds like an annoying program.

[16:50:38] <fuzzybear3965> bc-like means "supports interactive mode" and "doesn't require importing modules to add functionality into the working space"
[16:50:48] <grawity> so, python out of the question?

[16:50:58] <Blondie101010> that constraint will only limit your options and make them inefficient
[16:51:01] <fuzzybear3965> grawity Assume the system doesn't want the bloat of a python runtime.
[16:51:08] <emanuele6> bc has square root.
[16:51:21] <fuzzybear3965> emanuele6 it doesn't support fractional powers, it seems.

[18:52:22] <pyzozord> hey I'm trying to use "watch" utility but it doesn't respect my aliases and functions, do you know how I can make it work with my aliases so that I can do watch my_alias
[18:52:49] <phy1729> you can while sleep 2; do ...; done
[18:54:03] <pyzozord> I guess I could, I was just hoping to use watch
[18:55:07] <phy1729> watch is an external command, it can't see functions or aliases
[18:55:38] <pyzozord> maybe I can somehow watch bash -c 'my_alias' or something like that?
[18:55:58] <pyzozord> I tried that but I don't know how to invoke bash so that it inherits from my bash
[18:56:18] <llua> start a interactive shell, with -i.
[18:57:38] <pyzozord> watch bash -i 'my_alias' didn't help
[18:58:06] <phy1729> still need -c
[18:59:12] <Soliton> aliases aren't inherited.
[18:59:34] <pyzozord> interactive shell doesn't work well
[18:59:39] <Soliton> aliases are for your interactive shell.
[18:59:58] <NRK[m]> why not use the loop?
[19:00:08] <pyzozord> I mean things aliases and functions I defined in .bashrc and .bash_alises
[19:00:30] <pyzozord> it doesn't need to inherit from current shell (it would be nice, but I can live without it)

[22:49:23] <znf> Hi. Silly question -- how can I possibly delete a directory named "<?php\n\nnamespace\ PhpOffice\\PhpSpreadsheet\\Shared\\Escher\\DggContainer\\BstoreContainer;\n\nclass\ BSE\n{\n\ \ \ \ const\ BLIPTY/"
[22:49:37] <znf> when I tab-complete to it, bash kinda breaks
[22:49:58] <tirnanog> try disabling programmable completion first, if it's enabled: shopt -u progcomp
[22:50:18] <tirnanog> there are plenty of broken programmable completion functions being carried out there.
[22:50:30] <kurahaupo1> znf: do you have any other files or directories whose names start with "<
[22:50:41] <kurahaupo1> if not, simply rmdir \"\<*
[22:50:58] <znf> I'm scared of what that glob could expand to
[22:51:20] <larryv> lol are the outer quotes actually part of the file name, or did you just add them for your message?
[22:51:23] <znf> I can't figure out how this guy managed to do this
[22:51:27] <znf> larryv, added them myself, sorry
[22:51:34] <kurahaupo1> znf: read the glob carefully and figure out what it will do
[22:51:38] <greycat> Tab completion should work just fine.  You might have to disable bash-completion...?  God only knows what bash-completion will do.
[22:51:58] <znf> greycat, tab completion makes it do this https://i.imgur.com/u1DdolM.png
[22:52:07] <greycat> "bash" to get a new session, "complete -r" to disable bash-completion in that session, do the rmdir tab completion thing, then "exit"
[22:52:07] <tirnanog> disable programmable completion, enter \< then try completing it again.
[22:52:24] <znf> tirnanog, I did, same thing :D
[22:52:25] <znf> let me try
[22:52:34] <kurahaupo1> znf: type: echo rmdir \"\<*
[22:52:58] <greycat> I don't know whether a literal " is part of the directory name or not.
[22:53:09] <znf> greycat, it's not, sorry
[22:53:35] <kurahaupo1> znf: then rmdir \<*
[22:53:35] <znf> how the hell did this guy even do this
[22:53:56] <znf> kurahaupo1, https://pastie.dev/raw/GGvt0U
[22:53:58] <greycat> first guess, copy/paste error
[22:54:05] <kurahaupo1> znf: random copy-and-paste; reading "filenames" from an XML file;
[22:54:07] <larryv> you sure the completion is broken?
[22:54:26] <znf> larryv, I don't know, but it expands the \n in the filename, I guess?
[22:54:27] <tirnanog> I doubt it is.
[22:54:29] <larryv> 'how can I possibly delete a directory named "<?php\n\nnamespace\ PhpOffice\\PhpSpreadsheet\\Shared\\Escher\\Dg...'
[22:54:47] <larryv> looks like what you're getting, just escaped
[22:55:05] <znf> or, does the filename actually have a newline in it and `ls` just shows it as \n ?
[22:55:34] <tirnanog> ls can show in a multitude of ways, depending on the implementation. indeed, that can be taken advantage of in the case of GNU.
[22:56:11] <znf> https://pastie.dev/raw/lW9JPE says find
[22:56:12] <kurahaupo1> znf: oh, you have xpg_echo enabled. You might want to turn that off.

[22:57:15] <tirnanog> in the case of GNU, "LC_ALL=C QUOTING_STYLE=c ls" will give you C-quoted strings. once can take the "string" and express it to bash as $'string'.
[22:57:27] <znf> screw it, I'll just rm \<*

[23:07:41] <jelly> seems legit
[23:07:42] <greycat> Led_Zeppelin2: if it's a matter of "how the hell do I *type* this?!" put either the while loop or the ssh, or both, into a function.  Then use the function in the pipeline.
[23:09:13] <kurahaupo1> option n+1: put the select statement in a script on the target host, and just ssh host path-to-script
[23:09:36] <kurahaupo1> option n+2: psql -h otherhost ...
[23:09:49] <capt_mercaptan> option n+3: use ssh forwarding
[23:09:50] <Led_Zeppelin2> greycat, function idea is great! worked like a charmt

[23:37:58] <larryv> you might want to be more specific about the input you have and the results you'd like
[23:37:59] <kurahaupo1> Led_Zeppelin2: A common strategy when wanting to run an external command is to try execve(), and if that fails because of "format error", to try again with /bin/sh prefaced on the list of arguments.

[23:49:06] <greycat> Lies.  You introduced NULs in the second iteration.
[23:49:23] <greycat> The first had only spaces, tabs and newlines.
[23:49:44] <FIlystyn> yes because we have two answer options, no nul and nul. Since we have two questions here
[23:49:56] <greycat> ...
