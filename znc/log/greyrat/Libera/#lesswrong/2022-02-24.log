The study of perceived loudness is included in the topic of psychoacoustics and employs methods of psychophysics. Doubling the perceived loudness doubles the sone value. Proposed by Stanley Smith Stevens in 1936, it is not an SI unit.)

We conducted two experiments that asked participants to …)
[05:54:21] <SDr> " Emoji playing grammatical roles (i.e., ‘parts-of-speech’) were minimal, and showed little consistency in ‘word order’. Second, emoji were substituted more for nouns and adjectives than verbs, while also typically conveying nonredundant information to the sentences. These findings suggest that, while emoji may follow tendencies in their
[05:54:21] <SDr> interactions with grammatical structure in multimodal text-emoji productions, they lack grammatical structure on their own."
[05:54:50] <SDr> so, appearantly, from a grammar POV, emoji is "other" as classification,  but "non-redundant"

[10:54:08] <phill> Did Putin come up with an excuse like people said he would or was he just like "f* it"
[10:54:32] <PlanckWalk> Yes, he came up with all sorts of fanciful excuses
[10:54:59] <feep[work]> I don't think it'll ww
[10:55:12] <feep[work]> primarily because I suspect the strategic thinking is gonna be that ukraine is a poison pill
[10:55:24] <feep[work]> suck up cost and not give putin anything
[10:55:27] <adiabatic> for what, invading taiwan
[10:55:32] <feep[work]> no for russia
[10:55:55] <feep[work]> memes aside, war is generally very very bad for your economy.
[10:56:15] <feep[work]> and russia's economy is already not good
[10:56:22] <PlanckWalk> Well, long term it might be marginally positive for Russia but not until after Putin's dead.
[10:56:27] <feep[work]> I don't even think so.
[10:56:41] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, could go either way
[10:56:55] <feep[work]> especially once you dump sanctions in the mix
[10:57:05] <PlanckWalk> Oh yes, those will definitely hurt.
[10:57:11] <feep[work]> assume germany sets nordstream 2 on fucking fire (the politics around this are going to be *amazing*)
[10:57:30] <feep[work]> well, I'm not super confident we'll do the right thing, but it's at least an option
[10:58:07] <feep[work]> so this will suck up costs for putin twice over
[10:58:29] <feep[work]> I assume he'll eventually leave ukraine, purely on cost basis, and when he does it's gonna go right back to plan join nato, do not pass go
[10:58:44] <feep[work]> only putin will be down military hardware *and* economic power
[10:59:24] <feep[work]> like, I think a solid reason why people were skeptical of this happening is because it's just a bad idea.
[11:00:11] <PlanckWalk> Yes, I was unsure it it happening right up to the point where all the miltary forces were called in.  After that it looked pretty likely they'd get used.
[11:01:13] <SDr> <feep[work]> I assume he'll eventually leave ukraine, purely on cost basis, and when he does it's gonna go right back to plan join nato, do not pass go   
[11:01:36] <SDr> ^^ erm, 2014 annexation of Crimean  sets a counter-precedent to that
[11:01:47] <feep[work]> crimean is smaller and actually useful
[11:02:16] <SDr> my question is mostly whether he'll stop at east ukraine, or go straight up to nato's border
[11:02:25] <phill> What's the leading foreign policy newspaper? 
[11:02:30] <phill> Or magazine
[11:02:37] <feep[work]> not sure why he'd stop now, that seems counterproductive
[11:02:41] <phill> Foreign Affairs?
[11:02:47] <feep[work]> like surely if you go this far you go for the kill
[11:02:52] <SDr> feep[work],  so that he'll have buffer territory between him & nato
[11:03:09] <feep[work]> right, but to do that he has to decapitate I think?
[11:03:34] <SDr> well, ukraine can pretty much move it's capital "a little bit to the right.... a bit more... there you go"
[11:03:41] <feep[work]> if he takes east ukraine, west ukraine defines itself as a smaller country and fucking begs nato to join. why not? he's already indicated he's not stopping.

[11:30:19] <kuudes> ah, indeed
[11:30:24] <kuudes> 11 was the time?
[11:30:32] <PapuaHardyNet> the average increase in tokens used to represent a string using bytes instead of BPE(GPT2) is at least 3.5 based on my script running on a section of the Pile

[11:30:44] <kuudes> ok
[11:31:05] <kuudes> quanticle, putin started this operation imo on when they drove to ukraine in 22.2
[11:31:27] <PapuaHardyNet> so basically, if you can optimize an architecture such that the computation is 1/3.5 of that of a GPT2 architecture, you have succeeded in massively increasing precision without sacrificing context or compute efficiency
[11:31:51] <feep[work]> saturn2: I did!
[11:31:58] <feep[work]> saturn2: as said, my router is silly
[11:32:12] <quanticle> Okay, but if you're going to argue it like that, Putin started this operation in 2014. I'm counting the start date as when Russian units moved beyond the territory they seized in 2014.
[11:36:40] <kuudes> well, maybe. that seems indeed compare to spain in early 1900s, and this seems to maybe compare to checkoslovakia
[11:37:19] <PapuaHardyNet> so here's the problem: attention's computation cost scales by O(N**2). This is the main thing that needs to be reduced to make a byte tokenized model viable.
[11:38:09] <PapuaHardyNet> also, I apologize if it seems like I'm ignoring the actual conversation going on. I'm not, I'm just distilling the problem I'm facing down into easily communicable insights.

[11:38:58] <PapuaHardyNet> feep[work]: they are (https://www.gwern.net/notes/Attention). I am right now using a gMLP architecture (which has an O(N**2) complexity for the SGU (which replaces self-attention)), which I now believe I need to optimize

[11:39:35] <PapuaHardyNet> hahahah, if only. The unilateralist curse means this probably isn't true
[11:39:50] <feep[work]> well, but also you'd not want to advertise it for the same reason
[11:40:34] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, my plan right now is to replace the spatial gating unit in the MLP with a more efficient gating/attention replacement. Once that works, then I can continue training the byte tokenized model

[15:18:05] <PapuaHardyNet> if you want me to explain why I think vim is better than not using vim, and by extension, why using emacs is better than using vim, I will continue
[15:18:25] <gurkenglas> sure, sell me on emacs.
[15:18:34] <gurkenglas> i currently use VSCode instead.
[15:19:19] <PapuaHardyNet> I wouldn't *personally* recommend you use emacs, mainly because you may be nerdsniped into spending a significant portion of your time configuring it
[15:19:22] <gurkenglas> Relevant: https://github.com/semiosis/pen.el
[15:19:23] <Robomot> GitHub - semiosis/pen.el: Pen.el stands for Prompt Engineering in emacs. It facilitates the creation, discovery and usage of prompts to language models. Pen supports OpenAI, EleutherAI, Aleph-Alpha, HuggingFace and others. It's the engine for the LookingGlass imaginary web browser.
[15:20:38] <PapuaHardyNet> but I use doom emacs, and there are two incredible benefits I see: (1) discoverability - all keybinds, functions underlying keybinds, everything is discoverable. It is significantly easier for a new vim user to get started with emacs
[15:21:21] <PapuaHardyNet> (2) extensibility: elisp is a much better language for writing functions, keybinds, and customizing your text editor, than whatever vim, neovim, or vscode uses
[15:21:54] <PapuaHardyNet> vscode is more limited in the extent to which you can configure it in comparison to emacs
[15:23:00] <PapuaHardyNet> (3) org-mode: org-mode is the killer feature of emacs. You can thrive without emacs, and that's great, but if you want to use org-mode for, say, project management / task management, you will need to use emacs
[15:23:11] <gurkenglas> I find discoverability so important. I am sad that I cannot, like, rightclick on gnome's suspend button to jump to the sourcecode that implements it.
[15:23:48] <gurkenglas> Or on the "Li~a|gurkenglas" string in the corners of irssi to jump to the code that put it there.
[15:24:20] <gurkenglas> Does emacs let me traverse the causal graph like that?
[15:25:42] <PapuaHardyNet> yep, I just opened the documentation of `org-sparse-tree`, and found the source code at the end of the docs buffer, and then pressed `K` as my cursor was on top of `user-error`, which then opened the documentation for that function
[15:26:03] <PapuaHardyNet> (I'm guessing that is what you meant by "causal graph", at least)

[15:29:39] <Robomot> Belgium wants EU to stop issuing visas to Russians over Ukraine - minister (Belgium wants EU to stop issuing visas to Russians over Ukraine - minister)
[15:29:42] <PapuaHardyNet> that keybind is mapped to a function too. I can do the same with variables, with functions.
[15:30:21] <PapuaHardyNet> Each documentation buffer also shows the source where it is defined, what its current value is (if variable), and where it was referenced (usually in the same package it was defined int)
[15:31:07] <PapuaHardyNet> but yeah, the `z C-h` keybind does seem rather interesting
[15:31:09] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet: and you can dereference the "where it was referenced"?
[15:31:54] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't actually know how to do that. I *think* it should be possible, but if you asked me to bet on it right now, I'd say no
[15:35:09] <gurkenglas> if all the things like that are possible, the rest that needs doing is 1. finetune gpt on emacs documentation and/or various man pages 2. have an emacs keybinding for "phrase the thing you want to do in natural language" (maybe pen.el does this?). when i used emacs i remember being frustrated that the command that finds me commands whose description matches my query was no more convenient for 
[15:35:15] <gurkenglas> discovery than googling how to do a thing.
[15:37:24] <PapuaHardyNet> the problem is that lisp is too flexible
[15:37:36] <gurkenglas> Expand?
[15:38:27] <PapuaHardyNet> if you finetune codex on lisp then I would agree that the model would be useful. finetuning gpt on emacs documentation will only help with core libraries and keybinds, which is really not very helpful. The highest values comes from the packages built for emacs, and the customizability offered to you
[15:38:28] <gurkenglas> The ways to do a thing require too much creativity for gpt to reliably be able to tell you, because the way to do the thing might be a combination of three generally useful tools?
[15:39:23] <gurkenglas> sounds like there would also be a book full of examples for the less creative humans for how to combine those tools, for gpt to finetune on.
[15:39:24] <PapuaHardyNet> not exactly, not creativity. the territory shifts too fast for gpt to have a proper map
[15:39:35] <PapuaHardyNet> gpt's map will be outdated quickly
[15:40:04] <gurkenglas> Ah, all the things you've changed would have to be placed in GPT's context, you mean.
[15:40:51] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, and the model of the running state of emacs, while useful, is too huge to add in GPT's context. Perhaps GPT-instruct or that web-GPT model would help here, if you replace web with emacs
[15:41:04] <gurkenglas> it has occured to me that my using gptsh most synergizes if i do things in treaded ways, like if i use bash instead of fish
[15:41:28] <PapuaHardyNet> that's right! so if you use a constrained language such as golang, you'll get the most benefit out of codex
[15:41:59] <PapuaHardyNet> the more flexible the language, the more diverse the code, the harder it is for language models to learn
[15:42:18] <gurkenglas> I am willing to do less customization in order to keep gpt more effective, and/or to only ask questions whose answers i can translate to my setting
[15:42:54] <gurkenglas> if all emacs users have the emacs manual in common, gpt should still be able to advise me based on that as well as, like, #emacs could, or you.
[15:42:58] <PapuaHardyNet> I avoid customizability for doom emacs, and my "GPT" is the Doom Emacs discord.
[15:43:44] <PapuaHardyNet> well, yes. GPT finetuned on the emacs+elisp manual would probably still be immensely helpful, especially when it comes to debugging. Better than a naive programmer with no experience with emacs at least
[15:43:50] <gurkenglas> Precisely, gpt is a standin for chatrooms of experienced users, excect that you can be as annoying/RTFM-evoking as you want.

[19:14:55] <Robomot> mtgDAO.org - White Paper
[19:16:08] <gwern> two2thehead: seems easy enough to just not reproduce the artwork or flavor text. they can't seriously claim to police the titles
[19:17:00] <two2thehead> yeah that's definitely true. But that's not what these guys were doing :-/
[19:18:20] <gwern> I mean, it seems like they should be able to avoid it. like, if I buy a bunch of cards and I list the titles on my website because I am offering XYZ for sale at $123, am I violating Wizard's IP? no, of course not
[19:18:45] <gwern> tracking the movements of the cards in a ledger is no different
[19:19:07] <gwern> they are physical objects I can do with as I please, as much as wizards and many other IP holders would love for the first-sale doctrine to not exist
[19:19:50] <two2thehead> my pet theory is that they deliberately flaunted that they wanted to, in effect, be *the* Magic The Gathering nft 'layer'
[19:20:08] <two2thehead> they should have started small and worked their way up, if they wanted to avoid this
[19:22:55] <gwern> starting small may just mean wotc can squash you more easily
[19:24:34] <nshepperd2> people post cards with pictures for sale on ebay all the time and its far from obvious to me that that's not fair use
[19:24:46] <two2thehead> that's definitely true but you should ideally avoid what these people did https://www.mtgdao.org/white-paper

[19:24:55] <two2thehead> read the white paper, it's well written imo
[19:25:18] <gwern> nshepperd2: it's just not enforced. but IP is maximalist. hence tableau rights, photos of sculptures being problematic, people erasing small TVs with scenes from The Simpsons etc
[19:25:25] <two2thehead> I'll bet you a dollar that lawyer types read this and went 'Thanks for making our case for us'
[19:26:17] <gwern> (as I always say, to know what IP law says, simply assume the most horrible IP-maximalist interpretation; and then some; then you will be approximately right)

[23:41:59] <gwern> 'We had a data set of about 400 Ashkenazi Jews from families from very large nuclear families, families were both parents. And the number of children was anywhere between three and 20. The average number of children per family was 10 and they were all adults. So we knew the height. Steve Hsu: Are these orthodox families?

I mean, it's not really an embryo. It's like, it's [unclear]. It was a thought experiment. What if these children were embryos? I mean, it's the same thought experiment as you did with the UK Biobank. But we could go into very large...
[23:42:11] <gwern> ...numbers of children. But we only had height. It was only the study of height, unfortunately.' <-- *10* kids on average
[23:44:50] <Betawolf> well if you want to do selective breeding you need the stock to choose from
[23:47:36] <gwern> I'm thinking more of the population growth. I don't think the orthodox do all that much in the way of 'breeding'. the impression I get is pretty much every girl who stays in the community and is fertile is gonna have kids. and since they're monogamous, they aren't disposing of too many guys either
[23:48:32] <gwern> (sure, maybe rabbis are hugely venerated and hypothetically have even more kids with their wives, but when you're at a mean of 10 kids, there's not much room for differential female fertility. certainly nothing that will drive any interesting levels of selection)
[23:49:16] <Betawolf> isn't the pattern with these communities that they lose more on culture than they make in the bedroom? Or is that specific to the quiverful types?
[23:50:13] <gwern> the orthodox don't have that much attrition afaik
[23:51:15] <Filipepe> even Ashkenazi Jews?
[23:51:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Orthodox communities are mostly Ashkenazim, to my knowledge
