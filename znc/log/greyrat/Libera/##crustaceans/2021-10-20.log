[05:15:27] <dimadima> vercel is pretty excellent
[05:44:25] <gwozniak> congrats Xe
[06:08:38] <ngoldbaum> lmao facebook is rebranding
[06:11:33] <imode> to WHAT?!
[06:14:37] <dimadima> to what?
[06:15:33] <dimadima> to life
[06:15:47] <imode> they're a BDSM site now.
[06:23:49] <ngoldbaum> they’re a metaverse company now
[06:24:18] <ngoldbaum> early 90s cyberpunk dystopia for all
[06:24:24] <imode> are they for real.
[06:24:41] <imode> a _new name_.
[06:24:47] <companion_cube> can't wait for facebook on web3
[06:25:00] <companion_cube> what's the name?
[06:25:05] <imode> we don't know yet.
[06:25:23] <companion_cube> visageJournal, I hope
[06:25:26] <imode> the only acceptable metaverse is a graphical lambdamoo competitor.
[06:25:32] <companion_cube> mugZine
[06:25:51] <imode> mugZine is a good name for a pottery zine.
[06:25:53] <companion_cube> MaskEncyclopedi
[06:25:56] <companion_cube> a
[06:28:42] <imode> nobody wants a 3D metaverse that you have to buy incredibly expensive equipment for.
[06:31:12] <bkero> It's a good thing that Facebook makes a Quest
[06:34:26] <imode> you also have to have the hardware to run all of these experiences.
[06:38:51] <bkero> That's not done on the Quest itself?
[06:40:27] <imode> I thought that required a PC?
[06:42:19] <imode> ahhh it's got an ARM SoC.
[06:42:24] <defect> the quest doesn't. but i think the games aren't as advanced instead
[06:42:34] <bkero> It's a phone in the headset
[06:42:35] <defect> like, that half life game isn't available for the quest
[06:42:45] <imode> that makes sense, about time someone did that.
[06:42:47] <bkero> Err, yes it is, although it required plugging it into a PC via HDMI and USB.
[06:43:00] <imode> well yeah but it doesn't run standalone.
[06:43:12] <bkero> Yup
[06:43:36] <bkero> Titles too heavy to run on a phone can be run, but it required tethering to a PC
[06:43:39] <imode> maybe valve will approach that some day with how they're doing the steam deck.
[06:44:05] <imode> still, I don't want to have to strap something to my head or navigate 3D to enjoy the metaverse.
[06:48:09] <drakonis> good lord windows 11 is so horrid
[06:48:22] <drakonis> (i've been using it as soon as it went up on the insider builds)
[06:50:18] <imode> so business as usual for windows, then.
[06:53:27] <drakonis> they made it worse lol
[06:54:21] <drakonis> 10 had reached a point where you could put up with it because it wasnt all that bad
[06:54:23] <imode> there is no bottom.
[06:54:37] <drakonis> then 11 came in swinging and it got much worse to use
[06:54:54] <bkero> Still bad spyware
[06:55:01] <drakonis> they made the UI require more steps to use it like 10
[06:55:27] <bkero> Is the keylogger still enabled by default?
[06:55:51] <drakonis> hmm
[06:55:53] <drakonis> idk
[06:55:55] <drakonis> probably?
[06:56:02] <bkero> You don't know if your system has an active keylogger?
[06:56:20] <bkero> https://www.pcworld.com/article/423165/how-to-turn-off-windows-10s-keylogger-yes-it-still-has-one.html
[06:56:22] <buttsbot> How to turn off Windows 10’s keylogger (yes, it still has one)
[06:56:23] <drakonis> probably still does
[06:56:35] <drakonis> wouldnt be surprised if it was still there
[06:57:18] <dimadima> bkero: hyperbolic to call it a "keylogger" though, right
[06:57:29] <dimadima> if it was a keylogger, no one would make posts about "turning it off"
[06:57:49] <bkero> dimadima: No, I think it's not hyperbolic to call it a keylogger.
[06:58:01] <dimadima> logs keys thought it might
[06:58:04] <dimadima> though*
[06:58:10] <drakonis> the windows team is doing everything they can to justify windows's continued existence
[06:58:48] <drakonis> including android integration lol
[06:58:51] <drakonis> android app integration
[06:59:06] <imode> the moment they put ads in my start menu I dropped windows like a rock.
[06:59:15] <drakonis> look, they added even more ads
[07:01:54] <indigo> I mean, they don't really need to justify it right? Everything runs on Windows
[07:02:00] <drakonis> ha
[07:02:09] <drakonis> i mean, except the cloud
[07:02:17] <drakonis> does azure make more money than windows yet?
[07:03:01] <imode> I hope azure eventually dwarfs windows.
[07:03:05] <indigo> > Estimates suggest that Azure is already bigger than Windows and commercial subscriptions to Office 365 productivity applications.
[07:03:09] <indigo> According to CNBC
[07:03:12] <indigo> Not surprised
[07:03:13] <drakonis> lmfao
[07:03:16] <drakonis> well that explains a lot
[07:03:25] <drakonis> azure is driving the company now
[07:03:38] <drakonis> so that explains the recent windows maneuvers
[07:03:59] <drakonis> why microsoft has been doing a lot of cross platform stuff and linux centric developments
[07:04:43] <indigo> I don't think that's because of Azure driving the company
[07:04:45] <drakonis> it makes too much sense
[07:05:51] <drakonis> a surprising amount of sense
[07:05:52] <indigo> I don't think there is a singular driving vision for most of these big tech companies
[07:06:26] <drakonis> azure is large enough that it is more important than windows now
[07:06:37] <indigo> Right, but that doesn't mean that they just stop working on Windows
[07:06:38] <drakonis> the whole "run android on windows" thing, for example
[07:06:43] <drakonis> not saying that
[07:08:54] <drakonis> ah holy shit i can play smite on linux
[07:08:57] <drakonis> finally, thanks valve
[07:09:25] <drakonis> this reminds me, absolver should finally work
[07:11:05] <imode> that's still a thing?
[07:11:24] <drakonis> which one?
[07:11:35] <imode> I guess both?
[07:11:41] <drakonis> kinda?
[07:11:52] <imode> smite is the MOBA about gods right.
[07:11:53] <drakonis> absolver has a rather small but dedicated base
[07:11:55] <drakonis> yes
[07:12:00] <imode> ahh I remember playing that.
[07:12:00] <drakonis> its kind of fun?
[07:12:12] <drakonis> absolver is the martial arts souls-like

[14:08:44] <prussian> based on that quick disclaimer.
[14:33:51] <Brekkjern> I don't actually think there is all that much competition in that space to be honest. FOSS people want there to be, but realistically modern tools are written in Go. Previous generation tools were written in Python. I bet there are quite a few tools written in various languages too, but I'd say those two languages are the defining languages of that generation of tools.

[16:33:15] <prussian> I almost wonder if it is some framework like thing.
[16:33:21] <prussian> just random quotable.
[16:34:27] <dimadima> prussian: maybe? but that doesn't make it better
[16:34:32] <dimadima> it's so cringe inducing
[16:35:02] <dimadima> to me anyway :/
[16:35:03] <prussian> idk man.
[16:35:15] <prussian> I have to assume it's some god awful php, wordpress, frontend cancer.
[16:35:18] <dimadima> pull quotes originated in magazines
[16:35:21] <prussian> because ya that is hilarious.
[16:35:39] <dimadima> as a way to highlight some interesting passages to keep the reader engaged and maybe for visual nicety
[16:35:53] <dimadima> prussian: could be but like, wtf
[16:36:00] <dimadima> now i'm reading the same sentence literally twice in a row
[16:36:12] <dimadima> and the post itself is disturbing
[16:36:25] <dimadima> "why am i ever reading this? why did i even click on this?"
[16:36:43] <dimadima> okay lol i'm done

[16:39:41] <dimadima> i am prone to neurotic behavior but if i had an outburst during a VC interview i would immediately seek and irect all my resources to obtaining therapy
[16:40:50] <dimadima> or so i hope :)
[16:57:46] <gerikson> or maybe have someone else do the interview
[17:04:32] <prussian> when I hear substack I always think of that javascript guy.
[17:04:46] <prussian> dimadima: sounds about right though.
[17:05:32] <gerikson> substack is full of Nazi^Wtechbros

[17:09:24] <prussian> https://substack.net/ cute visuals...
[17:09:37] <dimadima> it makes sense as a name for a github character
[17:09:38] <prussian> ya. and like I said it reminds me of link related
[17:09:59] <dimadima> oh he's still on the web
[17:10:02] <dimadima> honestly i thought he died or something
[17:10:13] <dimadima> one day he's mr. javascript the next day he's gone
[17:10:19] <prussian> node hype is dying perhaps
[17:10:27] <prussian> maybe he is simply forgotten for that reason alone
[17:10:35] <dimadima> node is alive and well but he vanished in liked 2017
[17:11:24] <dimadima> yeah maybe less hyped
[17:12:07] <prussian> it's too mainstream now.

[17:16:32] <prussian> but only in a context of an event
[17:16:37] <ngoldbaum> is it arbitrage if the return is worthless internet points?

[17:17:34] <prussian> oh ok. that makes sense.
[17:17:37] <ngoldbaum> since then he has taken leadership of the anti-anti-trump right
[17:17:40] <ngoldbaum> on substack
[17:17:58] <prussian> is anti-anti trump like, pro trump or is there not enough negation?
[17:18:00] <dimadima> minting not only submissions but also upvotes is genius though

[17:18:13] <prussian> NFT all the things.

[17:18:50] <prussian> yes... nft it all

[17:19:36] <prussian> oh
[17:19:42] <prussian> ya I guess I know the type
[17:19:54] <dimadima> i was into NFTs conceptually but then my friend made me look at one of the NFT sites like a year ago and all the "art"
[17:19:55] <prussian> most righty stuff is really confusing.
[17:20:06] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: that implies being pro trump
[17:20:07] <prussian> i suppose the same sort of applies the other direction, in the depths of extreme
[17:20:08] <prussian> but
[17:20:08] <dimadima> it was insane

[17:20:59] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: just 1929 things
[17:21:04] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: focusing on the dems' shit while ignoring trump's mountain of dung is being pro trump
[17:21:07] <prussian> the hunter biden laptop thing was memey.
[17:21:24] <prussian> hell, the whole DKIM signed To: Hunter Biden email was sort of overblown
[17:21:28] <companion_cube> esp. when it's not even focused on the actual candidate
[17:21:42] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: i agree with you, but i also think the pro-trump right and the anti-anti-trump right are distinct camps
[17:21:43] <prussian> like, ok, google signed it coming from someone sending to biden, but where was the response?
[17:22:35] <prussian> I know a few righties that are basically straight up communists some moments and then straight up libertarians in other contexts. so I don't even know what camp a camp is.

[17:53:51] <dimadima> gwozniak: is there really no distinction? i've always been confused as to why you'd use the word "transpiler" for a "compiler" but thought i was ignorant
[17:53:57] <companion_cube> the only thing I could think of as a "transpiler" is like swc

[17:59:28] <kline> companion_cube, i mostly ask because you said "why shouldnt strings be in ocaml, its underused"
[17:59:34] <kline> which to me feels the wrong way around

[20:09:55] <imode> being able to phrase a majority of what you're doing as, effectively, a data pipeline is lovely.
[20:09:57] <companion_cube> basically iterators, no?
[20:10:02] <prussian> oh right that
[20:10:05] <prussian> the 8 things

[20:10:22] <imode> companion_cube: kiiiiiinda?
[20:10:30] <imode> more powerful than that.
[20:10:34] <prussian> job searching sucks
[20:10:44] <dcz_> streams are a lisp concept, right?
[20:10:45] <prussian> all the jobs near me are either .NET or Java stuff...
[20:11:01] <prussian> or, well dev-oops
[20:11:25] <imode> basically you create this value called a stream, can decide on the processing mode (parallel or sequential), do all sorts of intermediate filters, maps, flatMaps, etc. on the data, and finish it off in some terminal operation.
[20:11:43] <imode> and it's all lazy until the terminal gets called.
[20:11:52] <imode> so you can pass 'em around as values.
[20:12:26] <prussian> sounds good.
[20:12:34] <companion_cube> yeah, well, modern iterators :)
[20:12:37] <imode> yee.
[20:12:49] <companion_cube> oh well, is flatMap standard in java now?
[20:12:52] <companion_cube> truly the future
[20:13:04] <dcz_> lisp streams are abstracted over both eager and lazy containers though
[20:13:26] <companion_cube> which lisp? :D
[20:13:39] <dcz_> um, whatever was used in SICP :)
[20:13:49] <companion_cube> scheme?
[20:13:58] <dcz_> but I think it works in any lisp that has car and cdr
[20:14:06] <prussian> some scheme then
[20:14:25] <prussian> isn't the new sicp python?
[20:14:59] <dcz_> I read something along the lines that the course that SICP was made for switched to Python
[20:15:04] <prussian> ah..
[20:15:07] <prussian> makes more sense.
[20:15:39] <prussian> I heard the college kids at UConn are still doing "functional programming" with some scheme.
[20:15:49] <prussian> I never saw that where I went to school. lol
[20:16:14] <dcz_> after reading SICP I can see why this was the first course for programming and I'm envious they got to it so early
[20:17:32] <prussian> never read it lol
[20:17:36] <prussian> so i wouldn't know.
[20:17:45] <dcz_> the old-ass me didn't have the motivation to play with all the exercises, even though they looked fun
[20:17:47] <prussian> state colleges man... smh
[20:18:44] <dcz_> I do recommend reading to anyone who didn't work with a lisp before
[20:19:17] <imode> I'm still debating on whether I should build a lisp for my little environment.

[20:26:20] <Brekkjern> The functional programming course I am taking at the University of Oslo is using SICP and Scheme.

[20:26:27] <Brekkjern> Fuck you too, buttsbot
[20:26:37] <Brekkjern> I still have PTSD
[20:30:19] <dimadima> but it's true
[20:30:33] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: let me know how you find SICP.  I'm going through it again after many years
[20:30:34] <dimadima> well, not sure about a poor man's
[20:31:19] <imode> ahhh, the c2 wiki..
[20:31:23] <imode> many a night was spent combing over that.
[20:31:27] <imode> and laughing at TOPMind.
[20:31:32] <dimadima> imode: have you ever actually used a parallel java stream
[20:31:43] <dimadima> not to rag on it
[20:31:56] <imode> dimadima: yes!
[20:32:00] <dimadima> woah awesome
[20:32:29] <dimadima> that's cool imode
[20:32:36] <dimadima> do you remember the context?
[20:33:00] <dimadima> i started java at java 8 so i take all that shit for granted :)
[20:33:13] <imode> it's being used in my current project.
[20:33:24] <imode> whereby I hand an event stream to multiple parallel event analyzers.
[20:33:32] <imode> which then do their own filtering.
[20:33:34] <dimadima> you specify an executor and distribute the processing?
[20:33:39] <imode> essentially.
[20:34:07] <dimadima> coolness
[20:34:22] <cb_> jesus this post https://lobste.rs/s/gs9tn3/ok_lenovo_we_need_talk
[20:34:23] <buttsbot> OK Lenovo, we need to talk | Lobsters
[20:34:33] <cb_> i can't really downvote bc its technically on topic
[20:34:38] <cb_> but h
[20:36:14] <Brekkjern> gwozniak: I gave up trying to learn the material through it. I don't have time for the meandering prose :S
[20:37:47] <gwozniak> well, that's something at least :)
[20:37:49] <dimadima> i read the begnning of this as a child and wish i could find time to finish it some day, hopefully soon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code:_The_Hidden_Language_of_Computer_Hardware_and_Software
[20:37:49] <buttsbot> Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software - Wikipedia
[20:44:24] <gwozniak> I have never read that.  Sounds like I should
[20:45:23] <dimadima> i don't think there's much in there that a person with a CS/CE/EE degree doesn't know, but i don't have such a degree
[20:46:42] <dimadima> but i dunno, it's really nice. i don't know what distracted me from finishing it
[20:51:06] <imode> cb_: are you calvin
[20:51:52] <cb_> yes
[20:52:04] <cb_> it pissed me off i wrote a comment
[20:53:55] <Brekkjern> https://kly.no/misc/due.jpg
[20:54:25] <imode> curious as to why you think framework will self-destruct.
[20:54:39] <imode> Brekkjern: spaghet
[20:55:14] <cb_> because i think their "coalition" of interests is too wide-ranging and will piss one of them off, their gimmick is kinda stupid and they will have to break comapt eventually, the problems with modular desig, parts availbility, and the costs of a hardware startup
[20:56:04] <Brekkjern> imode: I don't think the spaghetti is the wors part of that image :P
[20:57:00] <imode> "their gimmick is kinda stupid" yeah I hard disagree with you there.
[20:57:16] <cb_> i mean the modules for diff port layout
[20:57:21] <imode> oh.
[20:57:24] <imode> yeah no that's dumb imo.
[20:57:47] <cb_> it's just type c! just put the type c ports (ideally on a sep breakout for easy service... like my MBA does) on the chassis
[20:57:55] <cb_> and you wont have to worry aobut 3d printing dongles
[20:58:04] <cb_> just use whatever donles exist on the market
[20:58:13] <cb_> and when you have to add a diff port it is immediately obvious
[20:58:28] <cb_> and it allows you to reclaim internal chassis space for battery/thermals
[20:58:36] <imode> though I can't think of better ways to do it than having you go full USB-C with dongles (which is kind the problem they're getting away from) or go full toughbook.
[20:58:45] <cb_> imho just go full type c
[20:58:50] <cb_> everyone's gonna have to deal with dongles
[20:58:59] <cb_> put a type A and HDMI port as a concession
[20:59:00] <imode> I don't, and I run a T430.
[20:59:49] <imode> USB-C is great if you don't care about connecting to your digital camera, charging your phone, connecting to your phone, or using any USB-A to USB-B/C cable.
[21:00:01] <cb_> my phone came with a type c cable
[21:00:09] <imode> type C to type C?
[21:00:14] <cb_> C to Lightning :)
[21:00:33] <imode> I don't think someone from the apple ecosystem can comment on port interoperability considering apple's walled garden and bizzare design.
[21:00:40] <imode> sorry, them's the facts.
[21:00:47] <cb_> fwiw i never plug stuff into my laptop but i have a desktop
[21:01:06] <cb_> well, i plug my headphones in
[21:01:10] <cb_> but that's in
[21:01:13] <dmc> how is MTP still this bad
[21:01:21] <imode> media transfer protocol?
[21:01:25] <dmc> yes
[21:01:32] <imode> I have no idea. somehow we fucked that one up collectively.
[21:01:32] <dmc> sounds right
[21:01:52] <imode> oh wait, it makes sense if you consider the origins.
[21:01:58] <imode> wiiiiindoooooooooooooooze.
[21:02:07] <klardotsh> I'll disagree on "just put the type C ports on the chassis". it's way easier to forget an external dongle than an internal dongle, and the "USB-C-ify everything" process more or less never happened (though I guess with C on the device end of many things now, the only thing stopping it is USB-PD negotiation constantly going the wrong direction)
[21:02:26] <klardotsh> (he says, very late to that part of the chat)
[21:02:29] <imode> klardotsh: the internal ports are type C, but I agree with you on the rest.
[21:02:54] <imode> maybe this'll help with the overall acceleration of that effort.
[21:03:16] <imode> ten more years and USB-C will be the universal port. until another standard comes along. then another 15+ years for that to become the standard...
[21:03:34] <imode> dmc: "Media Transfer Protocol (MTP), developed by Microsoft," <-- there's yer problem.
[21:03:40] <dmc> heh
[21:03:41] <cb_> imode: well, the EU wants to solve that
[21:03:41] <klardotsh> we've had 5+ years of Apple-enforced USB-C, the FW seems like something that won't move as many mountains (I say that as a fan of FW; almost bought one before instead going with an MNT Reform)
[21:03:45] <cb_> type c or bust now
[21:03:57] <cb_> i think the reform is goofy but it is obviously a niche product
[21:05:02] <dmc> maybe I should just use an SD card adapter to xfer stuff because this is painful
[21:05:21] <imode> that's what I do.
[21:05:29] <imode> fuck negotiating MTP stuff.
[21:05:39] <imode> the iDevice situation is even worse.
[21:06:33] <dcz_> yeah, the gimmick of dongles is not just "dongles", but "dongles are stowed inside"
[21:06:55] <imode> the dongles are coming from inside the box!
[21:07:50] <dcz_> cb_: your link times out https://sporks.space/2021/03/31/why-thinkpads-are-overrated-and-misunderstood/
[21:08:40] <hoistbypetard> i'd like my 2011 17" MBP with a modern motherboard

[21:09:16] <hoistbypetard> it felt like a good compromise. moderate weight. nice screen. nice keyboard/pointing device. fast. all day battery.
[21:09:39] <hoistbypetard> i could change out the drive and add ram after purchase

[21:28:23] <hoistbypetard> this feels pretty off-topic. https://lobste.rs/s/crqjxz/lawsuit_against_california_tv is it one of those stories that's going to be so loud it needs to stay anyway?

[21:29:44] <imode> probably not.
[21:30:51] <hoistbypetard> i miss groklaw's coverage of those kinds of things
[21:38:34] <gwozniak> The title alone feels like it's off topic
[21:43:08] <ngoldbaum> hoistbypetard, gwozniak: but there’s a law tag
[21:43:22] <hoistbypetard> there's an art tag too
[21:43:50] <ngoldbaum> knowing about the legal status if the gpl makes me a better programmer
[21:44:12] <hoistbypetard> the announcement of a lawsuit tells you nothing about its legal status
[21:47:16] <hoistbypetard> (i do agree that some bits of law are on-topic, and even that some coverage of a far future development in this story could well be on-topic. but i don't think this is particularly close yet.)
[21:48:26] <gwozniak> It has the possibility of being on topic. I'd actually have to check it out to know. But the title sounds like it's not

[23:30:25] <gwozniak> I remember a trivia night where the question was "how many time zones are there?" and the quizmaster insisted the answer was 24
[23:30:46] <imode> https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=how%20many%20time%20zones%20are%20there
[23:30:47] <buttsbot> how many time zones are there - Google Search
[23:31:07] <imode> I can see where they got it. -_-
[23:33:36] <gwozniak> jesus... I haven't used Google search for a while. The top stuff in that result is just... shit
[23:34:24] <gwozniak> I mean, the link to timeanddate.com near the top there is quite clear: there are more than 24
[23:35:29] <imode> this is what happens when you use shitty scraping to establish well-known facts.
[23:36:00] <dimadima> wtf people used to be so nuts with timezones. i once saw a table of timezones of american towns in the 1800s
[23:36:51] <dimadima> if nepal has a holy mountain thing going on that's pretty cool but otherwise i'm glad everyone else is 00 or 30
[23:36:56] <gwozniak> Essentially unifying time was a pretty great achievement, despite the fact it's awfully messy
[23:37:26] <gwozniak> Better than the, "it's noon when the shadow from the stick is gone" kind of approach
[23:37:26] <imode> "you're on my time or you're outta time"
[23:37:57] <dimadima> i wish i could find this table from the 1800s. you never know what you'll want to see later

[23:40:39] <gwozniak> I showed my wife so she could tell her students to not trust what they see
[23:41:29] <gwozniak> I find myself using the !g (pass through to Google) action on DuckDuckGo a lot less these days
[23:41:53] <dimadima> i switched back to google because it got to the point where i was appending g! to every single search
[23:41:54] <imode> I only use it when I'm not satisfied with DDG's results or I want to see the difference between the searches.
[23:41:55] <dimadima> mechanically
[23:42:10] <dimadima> i do not understand how people use DDG, and i tried for two years
[23:42:21] <dimadima> my queries are not exotic, i would think
[23:42:27] <gwozniak> I've been using it for about 10 or so now
[23:42:33] <dimadima> years?
[23:42:53] <imode> 5 years for me.
[23:42:56] <dimadima> has it even been around that long?
[23:43:16] <dimadima> i'm glad it works for ppl!
[23:43:49] <gwozniak> Yeah, I think I started using it around 2010
[23:44:58] <dimadima> " gwozniak> jesus... I haven't used Google search for a while. The top stuff in that result is just... shit" yes it's utter rubbish though for non-tech stuff
[23:45:29] <deadk> i use ddg, but it's pretty terrible
[23:45:33] <deadk> the thing is google is pretty terrible too
[23:45:55] <deadk> i don't think google has incentives to make a good search engine any more
[23:46:01] <dimadima> it was a breath of fresh air after DDG for me
[23:46:10] <dimadima> i couldn't find basic React stuff
[23:47:17] <dimadima> i dunno deadk, despite what people say, the general population is increasingly weary, however slowly increasingly, about tracking and stuffl ike that
[23:47:39] <dimadima> especially the MAGA anti-"big tech" crowd
[23:47:47] <dimadima> my in-laws haven't used google in years
[23:48:27] <companion_cube> the ones who post everything on facebook, dimadima ?
[23:48:39] <dimadima> not those
[23:49:17] <dimadima> my in-laws were always suspicious of facebook too
[23:49:34] <dimadima> love trump though
[23:53:26] <gwozniak> Lately, when I've tried passing through to Google, I get the same stuff I got with DDG
[23:55:54] <dimadima> i'm only posting this here because ironically isn't sam altman kind of part and parcel of the economy that created this? https://twitter.com/sama/status/1450876862910042113
[23:55:54] <buttsbot> Twitter - sama - please no https://t.co/Ed7YHI5IwN
[23:56:04] <cb_> i read that thread again and it got worse
[23:56:28] <cb_> HE PAID 1000€ FOR A W541????
[23:57:15] <imode> dimadima: yup!
[23:57:18] <imode> fuck him.
[23:57:38] <dimadima> imode: what the fuck is he complaining about. enjoy, sam
