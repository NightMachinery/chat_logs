[21:55:04] <drive_desaster> hey, I got the problem that I can't download torrents with a dht tracker and can't upload anything (I'm using ktorrent, so I hope this is the right place to ask for help)
[22:01:57] <The_8472> that sounds like two problems? have you tested with a well-seeded torrent with hundreds of seeds/peers?
[22:03:44] <The_8472> haven't used ktorrent so I can only provide general advice for bittorrent clients
[22:04:31] <The_8472> oh, you're on kabel-deutschland. I think they do CGNAT which means you only have proper ipv6 connectivity and not ipv4.
[22:05:16] <The_8472> I'm not sure if their CGNAT supports port forwarding, check their documentation, maybe the router firmware can forward port requests via PCP to the CGNAT.
[22:06:32] <The_8472> For context, bittorrent performs somewhere between "less well" and "not at all" when the client can't accept incoming connections due to firewalls or NATs.
[22:06:52] <The_8472> so port forwarding (manual or via UPnP or PCP) is required
[22:07:15] <The_8472> for more detailed info you'll have to check documentation for your client and your router
[22:09:55] <The_8472> or you could try a different client, I don't know how good ktorrent's IPv6 support is. But even for ipv6 you'll have to make sure that the firewall allows incoming connections
[22:11:24] <drive_desaster> Ihave tested it with ubuntu iso (900 seeds with an http tracker) and manjaro KDE with dht (can't tell how many but I guess it would download. I also have a vpn server I tried, sounds like I'll read up on how to do portforwarding on there.
[22:23:44] <drive_desaster> I forgot that in my tests to make seeding work I connected to tor as a proxy, now dht downloading and probably also uploading works I'll try to find another active http tracker torrent
