[03:16:54] <Sqaure> what benefits does that have?
[03:17:07] <epony> flakland, how old are you? ;-) kid
[03:17:17] <flakland> why do you want to know?
[03:17:17] <inhahe_> you can't accidentally execute data
[03:17:19] <nomagno> Modern CPUs are mixed Harvard and Von Neumann, so the most useful Harvard import: the Nx bit
[03:17:22] <inhahe_> especially data put there by a hacker
[03:17:25] <sonny> well, stuff like self modifying adresses doesn't work
[03:17:31] <nomagno> If it's not set, the data no execute
[03:17:46] <sonny> you can't get at data from instructions  basically
[03:17:51] <flakland> your whole chat strategy is to post spammy nonsense, then pivot
[03:18:08] <PlanckWalk> Yep, modifying data through some means and executing it is a common RCE tool
[03:18:47] <PlanckWalk> Not the only one, but it's a pretty broad class
[03:18:52] <nomagno> epony seems like a prototypical troll, and flakland seems easily irascible by trolls. Match made in heaven
[03:19:06] <epony> flakland, it's not a novel idea to call someone something challenging if you can't agree and want to derail the other party, by calling them your own fallacy ;-)
[03:19:20] <flakland> i'm asking for you to elaborate on your spam
[03:19:28] <epony> keep asking
[03:19:30] <flakland> you have no idea what you're spamming about
[03:19:39] <epony> actually I do.
[03:19:53] <flakland> so how is in-band signalling a "FAIL" in http
[03:20:18] <PlanckWalk> Mixing data with instructions makes it easier to modify instructions.
[03:20:18] <epony> and you don't know that, since you don't bother participating in the reading, and thinking, just want to find something to contradict to.. asshole ;-)
[03:20:29] <epony> flakland, ^
[03:20:37] <PlanckWalk> That applies to both RCE and protocols with in-band control.
[03:21:05] <inhahe_> PlanckWalk i thought modifying instructitons was problematic nowadays since the cpu loads several instructions into the pipeline ahead of time
[03:21:23] <flakland> i wish you would participate in thinking before posting garbage spam thoughts
[03:21:23] <PlanckWalk> inhahe_: That's a performance issue, but not a strong one
[03:21:32] <epony> flakland, stfu ;-)
[03:21:42] <nomagno> epony: You make me question if you spit out carefully composed sophist's lies, purposefully hypocritical statements, or nonsense.
[03:21:45] <flakland> "is what i'm saying based in fact"
[03:21:52] <flakland> that's a good thought to have first before spamming
[03:21:59] <inhahe_> PlanckWalk well i mean it changes how the program operates, because the instruction's already in the pipeline when you change it so the change has no effect
[03:21:59] <PlanckWalk> If you modify the data at least a few cycles before you execute it, you don't even see a performance issue
[03:22:08] <epony> nomagno, if you don't know by now, you can't know at the moment either ;-)
[03:22:21] <PlanckWalk> CPUs detect that sort of situation and flush the pipeline
[03:22:24] <sonny> inhahe_:  that just means a stall
[03:22:25] <inhahe_> ohok
[03:22:26] <PlanckWalk> Hence, performance issue
[03:22:37] <nomagno> Yeah it's just nonsense.
[03:23:15] <epony> nomagno and flakland are the same person then ;-) allow me to disregard your weak trolling, both of you.
[03:23:58] <[itchyjunk]> i created a poll in HN

[03:24:07] <[itchyjunk]> while you guys wasted your youth in petty arguments
[03:24:18] <[itchyjunk]> Take a second to digest that.
[03:24:21] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: what was the poll?

[03:24:40] <[itchyjunk]> :D its there
[03:24:41] <flakland> who is arguing?
[03:24:46] <[itchyjunk]> its about them drugs
[03:24:58] <PlanckWalk> Shouldn't that be "should cannabis be delegalized"?
[03:24:59] <[itchyjunk]> idk who's arguying. someone here always is so it was a save choice of word
[03:25:13] <[itchyjunk]> what does delegalized mean?
[03:25:27] <epony> in some languages "drug" means "someone else" or "foreign".. so drugs are the daleks or the narcotics?
[03:25:32] <inhahe_> the opposite of legalized
[03:25:40] <flakland> everyone knows who the spamomatic non-programmers are here
[03:25:46] <epony> ah, brainfog ;-)
[03:25:52] <[itchyjunk]> decriminalized is not the same as legalized though

[03:30:16] <epony> nomagno, by the way, did you know that RISC were a commercial failure in the 1990-2010 two consecutive decades ;-)
[03:30:20] <[itchyjunk]> you need some type of majority vote for that
[03:30:29] <sonny> ah
[03:30:30] <[itchyjunk]> so i'd say peoples view have changed

[03:32:15] <[itchyjunk]> they were tired of wasting time on people not commiting any crime
[03:32:17] <flakland> what pisses me of f most about HN is that the voting is manipulated, or however they decide page ranking. for instance the microsoft/activision news has thousands of comments and votes, but is lower than other posts from the same day with <200 points
[03:32:20] <[itchyjunk]> smoking weed and eating cheetos
[03:32:38] <Sqaure> Id vote legalize just because of all the crime its causing. If it wasnt for that, im not sure. 
[03:32:39] <[itchyjunk]> its decays over time.
[03:32:41] <epony> nomagno, here is the thing, also functional programming languages were almost completely discarded for system and application programming industry wide in the same periods, and you can see that trend again for RISC and FP langs in 2010-2020 so, that makes 3 consecutive decades of failure (or as it is known SICP)
[03:32:47] <[itchyjunk]> having upvotes is not enough to stay on top.

[03:40:22] <sonny> sure, but we aren't talking about those
[03:40:30] <[itchyjunk]> you said drugs
[03:40:41] <[itchyjunk]> peyote is considered as a controlled "drug"
[03:41:26] <sonny> sure I did, but the context is in the discussion
[03:41:38] <[itchyjunk]> what is the context?
[03:41:43] <[itchyjunk]> you said drugs and "the west"
[03:41:44] <sonny> if it's not obvious then it's stated to be canabis now
[03:41:58] <[itchyjunk]> so by drugs you mean cannabis ?
[03:42:01] <[itchyjunk]> odd
[03:42:35] <sonny> yeah, my statements were in reference to the vote that you mentioned

If you have a tiny itch to scratch

[05:26:10] <vdamewood> I'm kind of curious about these pop-up, cookie permission windows. I wonder if I could just have a block on every page, in an out-of-the-way area, that has a button to accept cookies, that would in turn add an 'allows cookies' cookie to be set, then just use whether the 'allows cookies' cookie is set or not to actually use cookies.

[07:03:14] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: the relation is below the diagram, in the paragraph

[07:03:28] <sonny> oh ok
[07:03:28] <[itchyjunk]> hello ski 
[07:03:52] <ski> i've been away for some time, yea
[07:04:33] <sonny> so, why use category theory to describe that dna thing? it seems easier to use state machines
[07:05:01] <[itchyjunk]> because the website seems to be trying to milk coronavirus for views
[07:05:08] <ski> sonny : anyway, i would have written ⌜gf⌝ (or ⌜g∘f⌝) rather than ⌜fg⌝, in that diagram .. although, perhaps that's just a typo ?
[07:05:11] <sonny> same for the phd
[07:05:12] <[itchyjunk]> everything seems to be in terms of dna and viruses and such there
[07:05:41] <[itchyjunk]> maybe they compose the other way
[07:05:50] <ski> sonny : no idea, haven't checked that talk (nor read the page you linked to)
[07:06:28] <sonny> I can see the use case for both things they mentioned, but it seems like a more difficult way to do it
[07:06:36] <ski> although .. i suppose considering transformations/maps/functions is different from considering transitions between states
[07:06:43] <sonny> but I guess if category theory makes it easy, then why not?
[07:06:53] <[itchyjunk]> when you have a hammer
[07:07:18] <sonny> you think it's being used as a hammer? xD
[07:07:25] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[07:07:45] <ski> one attractive feature of CT is the visual aspect, expressing conditions in terms of diagrams (rather than formulae)
[07:07:51] <[itchyjunk]> "Her work focuses on some applications of category theory to real life situations, applying theories of interconnected systems to that of spacetime, chemical reaction networks and machines."
[07:08:05] <[itchyjunk]> start with category theory and try to cast everytihng in the world as cat theory problem
[07:08:41] <ski> hm .. reminds me there's a book that's trying to apply category theory to software engineering (by some Jose Fiadeiro or somesuch, iirc)
[07:08:45] <sonny> that sounds difficult :O
[07:09:05] <[itchyjunk]> well cat theory and type theory have nice correspondence from what i hear
[07:09:14] <[itchyjunk]> so cat theory probably makes sense in software engineering

[07:10:37] <[itchyjunk]> i should really learn a little cat theory though
[07:10:38] <ski> yea, but ordinary set theory conflates two different notions of sets (material vs. structural)

[07:22:41] <[itchyjunk]> i think it's a generational thing

[07:25:01] <sonny> like, how there is fuzzy logic or hoare logic

[07:26:10] <[itchyjunk]> inhahe_, you can think of a proof as an object
[07:26:13] <ski> natural deduction is a *style* of *presentation* of proofs (for some logic, maybe classical logic, or modal logic, or linear logic, &c. .. which are different logics)

[07:27:29] <sonny> that's a classic exercise
[07:27:31] <[itchyjunk]> definition and axioms

[07:28:46] <ski> unfortunately, many (most ?) logic intro books tend to present proofs via Hilbert- / axiomatic style .. which is horrible to actually use in practice. you can compare it to programming in machine code. whereas natural deduction have "local hypotheses", which in programming terms correspond to "local variables"

[07:55:16] <ski> yea, i was referring to using a system in which it is impossible to express certain things (which typically we'd want to avoid accidentally expressing .. iow, typically we'd consider such a thing a "bug")
[07:56:57] <ski> inhahe_ : sorry, never found it useful to do what ? never found it useful to "not respect isomorphism" ? or never found it useful to "respect isomorphism" ? something else ?
[07:57:57] <inhahe_> ski for example, show with a lot of tedious steps that group theory is isomorphic to zf or whatever it was
[07:58:01] <[itchyjunk]> i was talked to joel about this but what would a programming language designed around category theory look like?
[07:58:04] <ski> (btw, one could still have *explicit* ways of stating in a system that we want to do the "unusual" thing .. but then that would require "opting in", using "syntactic salt", so to speak)
[07:58:23] <[itchyjunk]> i know it makes sense to build it around type theory then use the type theory / cat theory correspondences
[07:58:33] <[itchyjunk]> but does designing it around cat theory offer anything?

[07:59:44] <inhahe_> but i'm just talking about what ski taught me
[07:59:45] <[itchyjunk]> oh interesting
[07:59:51] <ski> (i also recall chatting, years ago, with someone else who were trying to build a programming language with direct constructions for products, coproducts, pullbacks, pushouts, limits, &c.)
[08:00:09] <[itchyjunk]> idk if ski said anything about group being isomorphic to zf
[08:00:18] <[itchyjunk]> oh cat theory based programming language
[08:00:23] <inhahe_> maybe i misremembered what it was isomorphic too
[08:00:23] <[itchyjunk]> also uses lazy evaluation? interesting
[08:00:24] <ski> heh, i didn't :)
[08:00:33] <inhahe_> to*
[08:00:43] <[itchyjunk]> we were discussing lazy evaluation here the other day
[08:00:55] <[itchyjunk]> i was under the impression there are more "modern ways" to do things
[08:00:57] <[itchyjunk]> maybe not
[08:01:13] <ski> no, isomorphism is a concept. and, typically, when working in a particular mathematical theory, that has its own flavor of isomorphism, we want to not distinguish isomorphic things from each other
[08:01:29] <ski> (i was not claiming anything about isomorphism between theories)
[08:02:18] <inhahe_> well, the thing that required many tedious steps to accomplish that nobody finds fun - if that thing weren't useful in a proof, then it wouldn't be an issue that it's not fun
[08:02:41] <ski> oy, rindolf. inf

[08:09:13] <inhahe_> hip hop is just fancier rap to me
[08:09:29] <[itchyjunk]> ski, the discussion had the tone that "modern" FP languages odn't use lazy evaluation
[08:09:33] * ski idly recalls watching an old C64 demo featuring some speech "Hip Hop for Gorbatjov"

[08:15:13] <ski> well .. i guess i tend to think of inductive types as giving strict evaulation, and coinductive as giving non-strict .. however, one could possibly consider optimizations which goes from the former to the latter, or so

[08:17:06] <ski> ideally, it seems to me, that a language ought to support both strict and non-strict, in a nice way .. however, there are some common asymmetries between values and continuations (the former tend to be reused, the latter not), which somewhat throws a wrench into the duality between these two

[12:17:36] <DnzAtWrk> how do you georeference HDF5 data
[12:17:43] <DnzAtWrk> or should I just pick another format
[12:18:22] <pyzozord> oh no there are sub categories of a category of epsilons?

[12:19:43] <pyzozord> I refuse this
[12:20:08] <pyzozord> it's too many epsilons, who can keep track of that. And what if they all mean something different?
[12:20:09] <DnzAtWrk> e 	е 	ҽ 	℮ 	ℯ 	ⅇ 	ꬲ 	𝐞 	𝑒 	𝒆 	𝓮 	𝔢 	𝕖 	𝖊 	𝖾 	𝗲 	𝘦 	𝙚 	𝚎 	ｅ
[12:20:33] <inhahe_> sounds like unicode in general
[12:20:40] <DnzAtWrk> unicode was a mistake
[12:20:47] <PlanckWalk> Well, two of mine were set element-of symbols, not epsilons
[12:20:58] <PlanckWalk> The other three were epsilons
[12:21:02] <pyzozord> unicode is lacking in doing better math
[12:21:19] <DnzAtWrk> should just have used a dedicated expression extension
[12:21:22] <pyzozord> it should be able to position things without any problem in my opinion, it has control characters

[12:21:53] <PlanckWalk> MathML?
[12:21:56] <DnzAtWrk> probably
[12:22:05] <inhahe_> pyzozord to be fair an adequate code for doing math would have to be like mathml, where it supports fractions and other positional constructs
[12:22:13] <pikapika> I think many websites have latex builtin
[12:22:18] <pikapika> wikipedia does for example
[12:22:22] <pyzozord> for some reason people find it more important to have support for some ancient oriental scripts that are of interest only to historians
[12:22:27] <pyzozord> than support for math

[12:26:19] <DnzAtWrk> another thing I'm starting to get sick off. Websites reloading after a few seconds
[12:26:25] <DnzAtWrk> stop it
[12:26:27] <DnzAtWrk> get some help
[12:26:54] <inhahe_> what that doesnt happen to me
[12:26:59] <inhahe_> why would they reload
[12:27:00] <DnzAtWrk> it happens on many websites
[12:27:13] <DnzAtWrk> probably due to various things that it reloads, such as cookie consents and such and such
[12:27:29] <inhahe_> weird i haven't noticed that
[12:27:37] <DnzAtWrk> I have noticed it quite often
[12:27:48] <DnzAtWrk> I fully expect websites to do something after it loads these days

[12:28:05] <inhahe_> that i've noticed
[12:28:09] <DnzAtWrk> always have to be something moving or popping up or some other bullshit
[12:28:09] <PlanckWalk> Half the time I hit escape to stop the page doing ... something.
[12:28:46] <PlanckWalk> I'm not sure exactly which page actions pressing escape stops, but it seems to prevent after-load bullshit maybe 2/3 the time.
[12:28:58] <DnzAtWrk> I think it stops all further loading
[12:29:11] <DnzAtWrk> of files
[12:29:28] <PlanckWalk> Ah, so it might be stopping some 10MB javescript framework

[13:34:49] <mrig> It's good to keep commits and branches to specific code changes where ever you can; Not easy to get into the habit but it is pretty useful to aim for that, and once you see the benefits of it it makes a lot more sense to do so.
[13:35:06] <vdamewood> loseti: Why did you make the changes in C?
[13:35:13] <mrig> It's kina curious the way that it does that, like a cross between a database and a file system.
[13:36:02] <loseti> vdamewood: because i didn't want to ruin B
[13:36:35] <vdamewood> loseti: Uhh, that was a case of ambiguous language. The question is why did you make the changes. Not why are they in C.
[13:36:46] <vdamewood> err the question should be, I should say.
[13:36:50] <mrig> loseti make another copy of B and merge into that, then B can be selected alone if required else C, if B is selected and applied and C later on, it will be a simple fast forwards.
[13:37:12] <mrig> so make D a brach off of B and merge into that.
[13:37:13] <vdamewood> mrig: C is already 'another copy of B'.
[13:37:30] <mrig> in which case just make a new merge request.
[13:38:32] <loseti> vdamewood: i improved some things in B (after suggestions)
[13:38:35] <mrig> loseti branching and merging is vastly simplified it git, that is what it is all about :)
[13:38:52] <vdamewood> loseti: If the suggestions were made by the upstream in the pull request, merge into B.
[13:39:32] <vdamewood> loseti: If the changes were related to the Pull request you made from B, you should probably merge c into B.
[13:40:11] <vdamewood> Finally, if the changes in C have nothing to do with the pull request, don't merge and make a separate pull request.
[13:40:12] <mrig> ^
[13:40:24] <beaky> nice i like the c language 
[13:40:34] <vdamewood> beaky: C is a nice language.
[13:40:48] <loseti> vdamewood: yea that's it.
[13:40:57] <mrig> thinking in git is like thinking in 3D :)
[13:41:00] <loseti> i also think i should merge C into B
[13:41:54] <loseti> since i'm using GitLab, will that update merge request on A automatically?
[13:42:00] <vdamewood> loseti: I once made a pull request on git hub. The upstream maintainers gave me suggestions to fix the pull request up to make it something they would accept. I made those changed directly in my branch in the pull request, for example.

[13:43:55] <vdamewood> I have no idea about Gitlab.

[14:14:32] <piou> "operation" is ambiguous: If I have 10 people and choose one it's going to be a person sure, so it's in the universe. But if you take the maximum size of the people in this set, that size isn't a person, it's a measure of length.
[14:14:51] <node1> I'm just trying to understand why we  make a rectangular shape for set of operations, And in general this rectangular shape is represented as {}

[14:15:07] <mrig> GeDaMo, thanks I think this and also the shape grammar stuff is going to become more and more interesting the further that I get into handmade hero :)
[14:15:49] <piou> You could make the universe a circle too, but since it's special it's worth noting it differently, hence the rectangle. That's all.

[14:44:01] <piou> node1: the right intuition isn't about infinity but continuity (I know, seems like I just use the word to define it). Consider two points on a graduated line, like 1 and 10, and put your fingers there. If you bring your right finger toward your left one at some point there won't be any whole number between them. That's the intuition of what we mean by continuity: an interval isn't "filled" with
[14:44:07] <piou> integers. But it can be filled with real numbers: they're continuous.
[14:44:50] <piou> Note that this intuition can be difficult because we're dealing with infinity: for example rational numbers ("fractions") are discrete just like integers, even though it may be much harder to see intuitively
[14:47:10] <node1> nice :)
[14:47:36] <node1>  graduated line means measurement scale here?

[14:49:53] <piou> These notions of discrete v/s continuous are very important in probability notably. If you use the wrong notion you may end up with a totally false result. For example let's say that I'm throwing darts at a circular target. I'm really bad at this, so it's really quite random where the dart ends up, but not so bad that I miss the target completely. What are the chances that I touch any particular
[14:49:59] <piou> point of the target? Well, given discrete probabilities there is only one good outcome (hitting that particular point) and an infinity of possibilities. So 1 in an infinity... There's 0 chance I touch that point in particular. And that's true of any point of the target. So by discrete probabilities the chances I touch the target are 0+0+0+... infinitely so. I therefore never touch the target. How
[14:50:05] <piou> then can my dart be stuck in it? It's because the points on the target are continuous, not discrete, and I made a big mistake using a discrete reasonning instead of a continuous one here.
[14:50:42] <node1> okay  i have left hand finger on my scale at  0, and right hand finger on scale at 6. Now i'm bringing my right hand finger to left on left finger where it's pointing 0 ?
[14:51:14] <piou> yep
[14:51:45] <piou> At first you'll have integers between your fingers, but at some point you won't have any (ie: when your right finger is at the left of 1)
[14:51:49] <bjs> node1: continuous just means there's no gaps, i.e. you can always find a value "in between" any two other values. So integers aren't continuous because between 1 and 2 there are no other integers.

[17:49:05] <pikapika> I am just clarifying a confusing point about it
[17:49:10] <bjs> jackson99: 1//2 being 0 is not weird, and infact I suspect almost all languages give you the same answer for integer division.
[17:49:36] <bjs> pikapika: yeah it can confuse people, but tbh any choice of rounding gives surprises when you start looking into it
[17:49:47] <bjs> e.g. round(2.5) vs round(3.5) and the fact different languages give different answers
[17:49:56] <pikapika> >System.out.println((0-1)/2);
[17:49:59] <pikapika> 0
[17:50:11] <snake> jackson99, now try 1.0 / 2.0
[17:50:13] <pikapika> bjs, round is a different matter since it deals with floats
[17:50:15] <rindolf> pikapika: ok. thanks
[17:50:23] <snake> dont forget that python is duck-typed
[17:50:29] <pikapika> snake, of course
[17:50:38] <deniska> pikapika: new comers either don't have expectations because python is their first, or we can expect them not to have expectations because it's not their second :)
[17:50:44] <pikapika> Its still quite strong for a dynamic typed lang
[17:50:45] <bjs> pikapika: i'm not sure why you're not getting it, it's exactly the same matter. the difference between java and python's output here is entirley to do with how they choose to do rounding.  sure integer division doesn't use floats but it's still about the choice of rounding
[17:51:08] <pikapika> for example it errors out on passing wrong number of args to functions or referencing member variables that you haven't set etc
[17:51:22] <pikapika> bjs, the thing is
[17:51:31] <pikapika> I will have to test with x64 asm

[17:52:23] <pikapika> deniska, many people learn Python after C
[17:52:30] <deniska> java predates x86_64 by maybe a decade
[17:52:31] <pikapika> C is probably the most common beginner langauge
[17:52:44] <pikapika> deniska, x86 also works
[17:52:45] <bjs> pikapika: C is nowhere near as popular as a beginner language than Java or Python these days
[17:52:47] <deniska> It's somewhat unusual to start with C nowadays
[17:52:51] <pikapika> I don't know what solaris ran on
[17:52:57] <pikapika> I think java was initially developed on solaris
[17:52:59] <deniska> sparc
[17:53:43] <deniska> python ints are not directly backed by underlying CPU types anyway
[17:53:44] <pikapika> What was the processor that the first java supported?
[17:53:49] <pikapika> deniska, I know
[17:54:10] <deniska> so they can have rules which are more convenient for a programmer, not for a CPU
[17:54:12] <pikapika> and they don't have an external behavior like cpu ints either, which is the potentially confusing point I was clarifying
[17:54:27] <pikapika> I think (0-1)/2 is also programmer friendly too
[17:54:29] <pikapika> but anyways
[17:54:31] <bjs> pikapika: Python chooses to round integer divisions towards -inf,  and Java chooses to round integer divisions towards 0.
[17:54:53] <pikapika> bjs, Java is a better example than C because it is mostly completely defined
[17:55:01] <pikapika> whereas C often left things to the compiler and architecture
[17:55:21] <deniska> python's choice is obviously better because if you plot it, it doesn't have an awkward spot around 0 :)
[17:55:34] <pikapika> But we raised an interesting question
[17:55:41] <pikapika> What was the first supported platform for Java?
[17:56:24] <deniska> probably a lot were developed in parallel? Write once run everywhere was always a motto
[17:56:51] <pikapika> deniska, the first release, whatever Gosling was working on
[17:57:10] <bjs> pikapika: well C is defined to truncate towards zero as well
[17:57:12] <bjs> for integer division
[17:57:23] <pikapika> bjs, is it actually defined or left to the arch?
[17:57:24] <bjs> I think both are fine decisions,  I'm not sure which is more "natural"
[17:57:25] <pikapika> Interesting
[17:58:12] <bjs> but the key here is not that Python gets it "wrong", or that there's any floating point inaccuracies or anything, it's entirely down to the choice the language makes when it rounds and how there are multiple ways to do it and you need to be careful to check the way matches what you want
[17:59:22] <pikapika> bjs, of  course

[18:19:24] <stevenxl> Folks, I'm looking for a talk made by a well-known female software engineeri / manager. 
[18:19:30] <pulse> i find this paranoia about UB equal parts comical and irrelevant
[18:19:39] <stevenxl> The only thing I remember about the talk is that it has a parable regarding chicken sexing
[18:19:45] <stevenxl> anyone know what I'm talking about?
[18:19:51] <bjs> pulse: what do you mean?
[18:19:55] <pyzozord> stevenxl: Gayle McDowell
[18:20:02] <pulse> bjs, "it's not that critical"
[18:20:35] <pyzozord> oh I don't know about chicken sexing (and don't care what that is :P). But Gayle is amazing
[18:20:43] <bjs> pulse: i mean UB is a serious trade-off that C makes,  to make the behaviour of the language less defined in order to aide compiler optimizations
[18:21:05] <pulse> how hard is it to write code without UB?
[18:21:08] <bjs> those unspecified parts of the language just become landmines with arbitrarry effects
[18:21:19] <pulse> if you invoke them, yes
[18:21:22] <pulse> why would you?
[18:21:54] <stevenxl> pyzozord: I don't think that's it. 
[18:21:56] <bjs> pulse: well, either deliberately because you know how your compiler handles it (and often you have to) or accidentally because of a bug.
[18:21:57] <stevenxl> I'll keep looking
[18:22:24] <bjs> pulse: or just because you don't know what things are UB or not (you might not realise you can't +1 on an `int` forever and go around and around)
[18:22:25] <pulse> bjs, and yet the vast majority of problems have nothing whatsoever to do with UB and everything to do with faulty logic
[18:22:30] <pulse> which is what humans are bad at
[18:22:36] <pulse> humans are good at avoiding "landmines"
[18:22:42] <pulse> we're not that good at actual consistent logic
[18:23:22] <pulse> bjs, that's a bit like giving someone unqualified controls to a crane, and then wondering why they collapsed half the building :p
[18:23:36] <pulse> UB isn't a problem in the vast majority of cases
[18:23:49] <pulse> in fact there's clear benefits to it
[18:23:51] <bjs> pulse: it's not a good analogy because if you press the wrong button what the crane can do next is fairly well-defined.  The point of UB is to remove that definedness.
[18:24:15] <pulse> it allows the compiler to make software faster
[18:24:18] <pulse> that's good enough in my book
[18:25:01] <beaky> yes it is very easy to invoke undefined behavior almost every single line of signed integer arithmetic that doesn't pre-establish bounds for example
[18:25:47] <bjs> pulse: of course it's a tradeoff that the C committee chose to make to allow compilers to do more thing,  but it is remarkably easy to hit UB cases.  In other languages at least when you do something bad you get an error or exception or something that tells you what goes wrong.  C does not give any such guarantee of what your program does
[18:25:51] <beaky> everyoen likes the idea of their undefined behavior getting optimized out until it happens to them and then they loudly complain to the compiler developers

[18:32:14] <merijn> It feels like this should be elegantly solvable via KD-trees or octtrees, but those don't map well to the data I have, since they mostly seem to assume sparse points in a big volume, whereas my problem involves dense (all or almost all of the volume is covered) with large volumes, not single points

[18:38:43] <merijn> The problem is that there's no total order on 2, 3, and higher d points. It's all partial orders, so I can't quite invent a logic that finds the right "greatest leftmost, topmost" point without ambiguity :\

[18:42:01] <merijn> bjs: I don't wanna do that, because my volume is huge, but number of cuboids is fairly small

[18:45:39] <merijn> DnzAtWrk: octrees seem most sensible for sparse data, while I have, essentially, 100% density
[18:45:54] <DnzAtWrk> I'd say that kdtrees are better for very sparse data

[20:30:17] <sonny> Certain websites have really poor search tools, I was wondering how I could make a better search tool, but it seems a lot less effective if I have to fetch the entire page. I can't think of anything else unless the website makers provide an api
[20:31:27] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, btw the image is wrong in the thing you posted yesterday
[20:31:35] <[itchyjunk]> should be gf not fg

[20:32:27] <sonny> thanks, that bit was odd 
[20:33:47] <[itchyjunk]> well done with that link :D

[20:34:13] <[itchyjunk]> a category has objects and arrows between them and must obey some axioms

[20:35:32] <[itchyjunk]> morphism composition must exist, gf is the same as map f composed with map g
[20:35:33] <sonny> the arrow is the functor?
[20:35:41] <[itchyjunk]> no
[20:35:47] <[itchyjunk]> functor means arrow between categories
[20:35:57] <[itchyjunk]> we are talking about whants inside one category
[20:36:01] <sonny> ooh
[20:36:05] <[itchyjunk]> category of sets has objects (sets)
[20:36:14] <[itchyjunk]> and arrows (functions between sets)
[20:36:20] <mrig> [itchyjunk] Why do you think that Alexander the Greek was so pleased to take Taxila?
[20:36:29] <sonny> user51: that is super cool, I guess the result is a vector image?

[20:36:49] <[itchyjunk]> alexandera the GREAT was pleased to take a lot of things along the way.
[20:37:05] <[itchyjunk]> it was a common theme, historically. he took things from every place he could.
[20:37:08] <mrig> Now bear in mind that this was the stomping ground of pannini
[20:37:21] <[itchyjunk]> where was i?
[20:37:29] <[itchyjunk]> oh the last thing i forgot was to mention associativity
[20:37:42] <[itchyjunk]> h(gf) = (hf)f
[20:38:01] <[itchyjunk]> so a collection of objects and arrow obeying those axioms gives us a category
[20:38:02] <user51> sonny: that's my guess as well. i was thinking it would work on bitmap fonts too.
[20:38:14] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, and haskell has a category of haskell types called Hask

[20:38:23] <sonny> user51: you're a genius
[20:38:29] <[itchyjunk]> and morphisms from Hask to Hask is monad
[20:38:37] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: I thought that was a joke lol
[20:38:44] <[itchyjunk]> what was?
[20:38:54] <sonny> category of types called Hask
[20:38:57] <mrig> This is like talking with a small child.
[20:38:59] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, the arabics translating most of western philo is probably a joke
[20:39:01] <[itchyjunk]> oh you mean that
[20:39:03] <[itchyjunk]> no it's not a joke
[20:39:14] <[itchyjunk]> there is a nice corrospondence between type theory and cat theory
[20:39:27] <sonny> ah, interesting
[20:39:39] <user51> sonny: i'm too lazy to be a genius.
[20:39:39] <sonny> but I still don't know what a monad is :P
[20:39:47] <sonny> except that it is a functor?
[20:39:50] <[itchyjunk]> monad is a endo functor
[20:39:55] <sonny> yes!
[20:40:06] <[itchyjunk]> it maps one type to another
[20:40:11] <[itchyjunk]> (a -> b) is a type
[20:40:18] <mrig> Just throw in some long words that you've remembered, does not matter if you actually know what they mean :|
[20:40:23] <[itchyjunk]> (Maybe a -> Maybe b) is a type
[20:40:40] <mrig> a computer can do that too.

[23:04:42] <lf94> And if you want "to scale" simply add more machines
[23:04:56] <bjs> lf94: where each machine handles 1 user at a time?

[23:05:30] <bjs> lf94: isn't "scaling" about making N as large as possible
[23:05:32] <bjs> why is that bs?
[23:05:55] <nomagno> lf94: Modern CPUs have multiple cores because it is way less cumbersome and way more consistent than making a cluster of CPUs
[23:06:03] <lf94> Because to make N large as possible don't you just minimize all memory usage of the program to the point where it can't be minimized any more
[23:06:24] <o|||||o> pyzozord, that doesn't really apply here, but thanks
[23:06:25] <bjs> lf94: no, infact sometimes using more memory can make things faster
[23:06:25] <InPhase> lf94: Even on single core machines that didn't max out throughput, since processes spend a lot of time waiting.
[23:06:31] <bjs> lf94: (e.g. by caching)

[23:07:31] <bjs> lf94: if 10 users come asking for the same page, if you do the re-rendering 10 times it'll be slower than caching the whole page and just returning it 9 times in a row.  This program is bigger, and more complicated and uses more memory but would have an incredibly large N
[23:07:41] <bjs> lf94: all of the things you describe can help make N bigger

[23:09:36] <bjs> lf94: okay but caching doesn't minimise,  it *increases* the amount of memory you're using.  It's a direct contradiction to your idea that all you have to do is minimise resource usage

[23:09:49] <nomagno> ^
[23:09:49] <pyzozord> in colloquial usage scalining is just a broad term for for techniques used to make a computer system handle more computation

[23:10:11] <bjs> lf94: yes, you can sometimes scale things by adding more computers.  But engineering is about making the most of what you have, and spending as little money as possible

[23:14:15] <epony> that's not all of the options and implementation choices
[23:14:17] <pyzozord> but it's another definition/categorization discussion it seems, I'm not really interested in semantics
[23:14:21] <nomagno> The point is making the program faster for the use case of a lot of users requesting stuff at once

[23:19:20] <nomagno> epony: What was your point?
[23:19:24] <lf94> caching involves more memory
[23:19:26] <bjs> lf94: is a thing you can totally do in software (and people do) and makes a big difference
[23:19:26] <epony> on maximum optimised software you will eventually fill the network first

[23:19:43] <nomagno> I didn't talk about monolithic programs
[23:20:00] <bjs> lf94: okay but in this world there is no software so yes everything is hardware 
[23:20:02] <bjs> adding or removing hardware
[23:20:04] <epony> the bottle neck (slow part) is always the remote connectivity, throughput, latency and request timeouts and multiple requests at the same time
[23:20:13] <pyzozord> lf94: thing is, all that software that they use for scaling, they do it to orchestrate the hardware and solve problems that come with handling the hardware
[23:20:36] <bjs> lf94: but the same applies, I can scale things by removing hardware to make the hot paths faster or I can scale by adding more hardware (like caches and complex protocols between them)
[23:20:43] <epony> and usually, all problems in scalability come from poor database and table (data modelling) design
[23:20:44] <bjs> There's no hard rule that less and/or more => better scaling
[23:20:44] <pyzozord> lf94: you'll execute your idea you'll find that at some scale it's too simple/brittle and takes too much time to maintain

[23:21:54] <bjs> lf94: look at how CPUs scale things,  you have pipelines (do many things concurrently without adding more hardware), caches (distribute the memory around locally), multicore (copy/paste hardware to do more work).
[23:22:00] <epony> eventually for web servers (worker nodes) you want machines with manycore and multithreaded processors

[23:28:43] <epony> so the worst design is to stack several layers of complex virtualisation and expect performance when you have smaller percentage of the CPU available due to overhead and context switching

[23:29:34] <bjs> lf94: if your argument is that "scaling is bullshit" because some other poor person is going to have to do the actual design and engineering to make your programs scale, then sure :P  but you really want to design it all together.  If your program is a black-box that uses a terrible algorithm then the best thing you can do is re-write the program to be better.
[23:29:36] <epony> and the best design is minimal instantiation at a barebones system that rapidly services the worker subroutines at maxixum performance of the network drivers and from RAM

[23:31:01] <bjs> lf94: but like i say there's lots you can do, by changing the algorithm your program uses, by adding or deleting or moving around resources (whether it be hardware or whatever),  by designing better protocols that reduce the amount of work or time needed to do things and to architect things to share resources where possible.  These can be done within a program, or you can design specific hardware to do them, or they can be part of a whole distributed 
[23:31:01] <bjs> system of many computers doing all these things.
[23:31:12] <epony> so small (sub)programs with reusable parts (common routines) and packing your data structures is teh turbocharger mode
[23:31:41] <lf94> epony: that's what I'd expect of any program that wants to be efficient.
[23:32:08] <epony> so you separate workloads and stages of the whole application on various cluster / groups of machines by part of the application
[23:32:34] <epony> it's a highly manual and target specific method though, not universal

[23:33:44] <epony> in trivial / naive implementations you get a stock OS and try to make do with stock web server (designed for performance and concurrency), and separate your interpreter and have that provide on demand data to serve by traffic / termination nodes

[23:35:54] <epony> there are a couple of books on that ;-) (commercial ones)
[23:35:58] <lf94> When I meant "scaling is bullshit" I meant it's not rocket science, it's a matter of just parallelizing a process and that's about it - everything else above that is a matter of convenience
[23:36:12] <lf94> Going with unikernel -> much less convenient
[23:36:30] <lf94> Going with Linux and Apache -> much more convenient
[23:36:48] <epony> the performance on minikernels is lower, contrary to expected belieds

[23:50:52] <pyzozord> I can't tell english accents apart, except generic american, and generic british
[23:51:21] <bjs> lf94: it's not *just* about parallelizing things,  if you imagine you had a system that computed fibonacci numbers or something if you use the naive recursive algorithm to do it then no amount of extra hardware or parallel distributed computing can beat just using a dynamic programming algorithm instead, even though it will actually use more memory.

[23:52:42] <mrig> epony in britain too, they may have picked it up whilst subject to colonisation.
[23:53:01] <bjs> lf94: and the hard part of "scaling" is not realising that "faster algorithm = more throughput" or "parallelize = faster" but in designing and implementing systems that can actually make use of those things,  even if it was *someone else* who did the work to implement the database software or hardware that you can buy off the shelf

[23:54:27] <epony> so the real downside of the stick is, it's single threaded and very low rate of data store / retrieve, and not remotely accessible
[23:55:07] <GeDaMo> What if you have two sticks?:|
[23:55:16] <epony> which makes it a very primitive instrument for calculation and more useful for "measurement" and "applied methodologies" and low density data storage
[23:56:13] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: it is carefully studied in the video. Two sticks connected by a string are a far inferior weapon because You are loosing control of half of your stick.
