[01:12:22] <williamboman> Alright docker images seems fine, although build takes 20 minutes now
[01:12:38] <bookworm> XD use docker they said
[01:14:28] <williamboman> Well considering it's doing concurrent cross-platform builds on a completely free worker node, it's pretty OK :D. It'd be annoying if it was a daily event though
[01:14:53] <bookworm> fair, luckily that's not an issue really
[01:15:29] <williamboman> And the node-sqlite3 dependency seems really out of shape. It's what's causing the extra build time as it needs to natively compile
[01:16:30] <bookworm> it is out of shape, but more because it ships old dependencies that also forces us to use python2. The native compilation only happens if your node+arch combination isn't supported with prebuilt binaries
[01:16:34] <xnaas> ARM bad, then! ;P
[01:17:15] <dav1d> the emulation of arm is just so slow (docker buildx)

[04:59:14] <torresjrjr> i keep on /connect'ing, nothing.
[04:59:18] <xnaas> Are these both installed "baremetal"?
[04:59:25] <xnaas> Or is Docker or something else involved
[04:59:48] <torresjrjr> both from yay (aur) on an Arch Linux VPS
[05:00:05] <xnaas> If it's the same machine and baremetal, you could specify 127.0.0.1, I guess, and see if that works.
[05:00:09] <xnaas> (Just to verify)
[05:01:00] <torresjrjr> I've tried "localhost". It said the certificates don't match blah blah. Probably because I needed to tick off the certificates box.
[05:01:14] <torresjrjr> I'll try again and come back
[05:01:17] <xnaas> Yeah, if you don't have a valid cert, you'll have to uncheck that.
[05:02:10] <torresjrjr> It works with "localhost" and the "trusted certs" box unchecked.
[05:02:30] <torresjrjr> So, it's my certificate, isn't it?
[05:02:40] <torresjrjr> wait no, because that wasn't the original error.

[11:24:17] <bookworm> is there a question in there or is that just for our entertainment ;) ?
[11:26:43] <EternalMan> Mostly just for your gratification and enjoyment bookworm
[11:27:36] <EternalMan> I suppose I could ask whether it is strictly necessary to run the command?
[11:28:21] <bookworm> it's not necessary, it simply means you have outdated themes or other plugins, meaning the update will probably have some theme issues now as new stuff was introduced in 4.3
[11:28:40] <bookworm> but you can happily keep using what you have, with the drawback of missing functionality / bugs
[11:28:45] <bookworm> up to you really
[11:30:15] <EternalMan> ah I see, thanks. I expect it's that plugin from minidigger to add commands that's out of date, i don't have any themes installed
[11:30:31] <bookworm> ah, then simply wait

[15:49:26] <hbag> hey, where are thelounge's web files stored? i got a .woff file that i want to have the stylesheet use, but i really dont know where to stick it
[15:52:18] <bookworm> in the usual node modules folder of your installation method
[15:52:28] <bookworm> find (the command) is your friend
[15:53:29] <bookworm> but in your case, simply add it to the theme itself
[15:54:03] <hbag> yeah i'd use "find" but im running it on a huge cluster with several webservers running
[15:54:29] <bookworm> https://thelounge.chat/docs/guides/theme-creation#shipping-additional-files-in-the-theme
[15:54:45] <bookworm> ^ do that rather than monkey patching your server
[15:55:19] <hbag> ...uh-huh, and what if i literally only want to change the font on this pre-existing theme
[15:55:31] <hbag> i think making a whole new theme and going through all this is a bit overkill for that

[16:07:52] <bookworm> considering the nature of CSS you can probably import the default theme and just add what you need, aka the font
[16:08:13] <bookworm> so it would be much cleaner and wouldn't break between updates
[16:08:58] <majavah> I import my custom fonts from a separate server, but just a separate vhost on the same server in your apache/nginx/whatever you have in front of thelounge should work fine
[16:09:10] <hbag> ...yes, Activ8, but i dont know where to put the .woff file so that thelounge can actually *find* it.
[16:09:28] <hbag> i've put it in the same place as the theme's .css file, but it still can't seem to find the file, considering the font is unchanged
[16:11:14] <bookworm> TL won't care if your proxy serves the url, as for the CSS file, how did you install TL?
[16:14:16] <bookworm> /usr/lib/thelounge/node_modules/thelounge/public/themes/default.css or something along those lines

[22:11:31] <thelounge6557> Hi, i've been running The Lounge in a docker container for a while now without any issues but I can't seem to get the latest version working
[22:11:50] <thelounge6557> it keeps crashing with exit code 134
[22:12:21] <thelounge6557> I tried creating a new container with default options but that too fails, any ideas on how to fix this?
[22:26:57] <lucenera> Any decent guide to install the lounge on freebsd?

[23:27:45] <lazyreader> thelounge6557 134 can mean "node ran out of memory", are you artificially restraining the amount of memory available, or running it on a potato?

[23:39:25] <thelounge6557> i'm running it on a pi 4
[23:39:41] <thelounge6557> there's plenty of memory available 
[23:40:29] <thelounge6557> this is all i can see in the logs:
[23:40:30] <thelounge6557> Node.js[10]: ../src/util.cc:188:double node::GetCurrentTimeInMicroseconds(): Assertion `(0) == (uv_gettimeofday(&tv))' failed.

[23:42:30] <bookworm> that's node bailing because your env is broken, probably a compiler mismatch or something
[23:42:43] <bookworm> which container do you run?
