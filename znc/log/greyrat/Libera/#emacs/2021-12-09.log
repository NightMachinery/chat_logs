[08:09:03] <bpalmer> I was just talking with soembody the other day about the various ecological niches that sports occupy
[08:09:29] <codingquark> Good morning!
[08:09:42] <bpalmer> baseball -- and, I imagine, cricket -- really requires a certain amount of raw space to run around in, as it gets quite dangerous to have a ball flying at speed in confined quarters
[08:10:30] <codingquark> You would think that, but I've played cricket indoors in friends' homes
[08:10:41] <codingquark> "Try not to break shit!"
[08:10:43] <bpalmer> whereas soccer/futbol and basketball both can be adapted to very minimal space  and  need just a ball, or a ball and net.
[08:10:52] <twb> I had a teacher who lost an eye playing indoor cricket
[08:11:25] <twb> I think... it might have been football
[08:11:30] <codingquark> I had stitches on my lips because the batsman's bat hit me and I was that close
[08:11:34] <bpalmer> so soccer struggles to take root in the US because basketball is entrenched in much the same niche.
[08:11:50] <twb> bpalmer: yeah I was thinking basketball has similar case
[08:12:41] <twb> That's why in the 1920s Americans were writing that basketball was a "sneaky sport naturally fit for jews", because back then that's who lived in urban ghettos
[08:14:09] <bpalmer> of course, I don't know where sports like badminton or volleyball fit in.
[08:14:20] <twb> squash
[08:14:28] <twb> squash seems to be a rich people thing
[08:14:41] <twb> What's the tron sport... peloton or something

[21:14:09] <corwin> various grep powered things seems to work pretty well under windows for me

[21:59:14] <bremner> I live in debian world, where we build binary packages
[21:59:15] <technomancy> still toh?
[21:59:24] <technomancy> why would you get HTML when you install something thru apt?
[21:59:37] <bremner> because people like documentation?
[21:59:45] <bremner> I must be missing something...
[22:00:20] <technomancy> I guess I'm thinking of this as used for like API docs and stuff
[22:00:28] <technomancy> not end-user docs
[22:01:11] <bpalmer> rudybot: if people had more confidence in interpreters, they wouldn't need binary packages.
[22:01:34] <rudybot> bpalmer: Just a feeling right now; but the Gambit's size and how it's working so far fills me with confidence that it's plausible - ECL much less so.

[22:03:51] <technomancy> I generally don't like game jams with themes, but I think a good theme would be one where the game you made is supposedly a brand promotion like that for a cereal or restaurant
