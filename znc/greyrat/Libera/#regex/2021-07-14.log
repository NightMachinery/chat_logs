[07:34:02] <ramesh> i need regex which does not allow if the user enters something like 11. or 12.0

[12:35:22] <axeld> If I replace the [^:] by [x] itÂ´s working, but will clobber ://, naturally
[12:36:41] <axeld> Thanks digitok! That will even leave :/// intact, which I actually like better than my solution
[12:36:56] <digitok> cool :) yw
[12:37:04] <axeld> Can you explain why [^:] did not work, but [x] would have?
[12:38:09] <digitok> [^:] works, but it should probably be [^/:]
[12:38:53] <digitok> if you match the first / with [^:] then you'll put it back with $1
[12:39:54] <axeld> digitok: Ah, so thatÂ´s why ([^:]|) did not work either!
[12:40:23] <axeld> Unfortunately, Java doesnÂ´t like your expression; it does not find a group
[12:40:35] <digitok> which groupd?
[12:40:39] <digitok> group*
[12:40:50] <axeld> To replace, I guess
[12:41:44] <digitok> there's no group in my regex

[12:42:10] <axeld> Oh no, my bad
[12:42:32] <axeld> I didnÂ´t notice you had a different replacement
[12:42:51] <axeld> So the negative lookup also needs the parenthesis

[19:15:44] <zodd> Hi. I need some advice on a working regex I created. It works for pcre2 but not Python. The other thing is that it is quite strict regarding exact number of spaces etc. So making it more flexible/generic would be nice. Regex+example: https://regex101.com/r/cvgUak/1/
[19:16:00] <zodd> any suggestions?

[19:37:33] <digitok> does it need to be more flexible
[19:39:55] <digitok> re making it work in python, you just need to add "P" to all of the named groups
[19:40:24] <digitok> (?<a>...)  to  (?P<a>...)
[19:42:04] <digitok> for the spaces if you want to allow more, just add  +  after the  \s  that don't already have it
