[01:32:37] <dcx> Hey is there any way to stop interactive raku from closing when I press ^C?
[01:33:19] <dcx> Like in many languages that just stops the main thread and gets you a new line but here it causes the raku interpreter to close
[01:33:40] <dcx> In python I think it raises a keyboard exception I think

[01:37:30] <MasterDuke34> i suspect the repl could start with a signal handler for ^C. probably worth raising an issue on github asking about it
[01:37:33] <leont> control-C raises a SIGINT
[01:38:06] <leont> You can handle that, but making it throw an exception right there and then is trickier
[01:39:30] <dcx> Ok I'll open an issue :)
[01:39:51] <dcx> This is an issue for rakudo right?
[01:40:45] <kybr> i'm trying to get the behaviour of the command line `sort -df` from our .sort operation. it is sortof .sort({$^a.uc cmp $^b.uc}) but that does not ignore all chars except letters and spaces.
[01:41:08] <codesections> leont: what's tricky about throwing there?  I would have thought that `signal(SIGINT).tap({die})` would work -- am I missing something?
[01:41:11] <kybr> i guess i have to regex

[01:42:19] <leont> When will that throw? And whereto?
[01:43:09] <leont> It's handled by the event loop, I can only assume it will be handled as other asynchronous IO

[18:38:49] <antononcube> Hi! I want to define left and right "word" boundary assertions that for which "word" consist of alpha-numeric characters _and_ punctuation characters. E.g. I want to have word boundaries for words like ".net" or "c++" and parse a list of such words. I want to parse a list of 
[18:38:49] <antononcube> This left boundary definition seems to work together with >> : regex wbpl { <!after [ <alnum> | <punct> ]> <?before [ <alnum> | <punct> ]> }
[18:38:50] <antononcube> The parsing stops working when I try to use this right boundary defintion: regex wbpr { <?after [ <alnum> | <punct> ]> <!before [ <alnum> | <punct> ]> }
[18:38:50] <antononcube> Any suggestions?
[18:39:55] <moritz> antononcube: what's an example of where you want it to match and where it doesn't match?
[18:40:31] <antononcube> '.net framework, c++, java, and software architect'
[18:41:53] <antononcube> @moritz Thank you for replying! Please, take a look in these definitions: https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-DSL-Entity-Jobs/blob/main/lib/DSL/Entity/Jobs/Grammar/EntityNames.rakumod 
[18:43:15] <moritz> antononcube: http://perlpunks.de/paste/show/60c61269.6e90.d6 your word boundary regex seems to work for me
[18:44:57] <moritz> http://perlpunks.de/paste/show/60c612d3.6e90.3b3 this one illustrates all the position where it matches

[18:59:09] <antononcube> @moritz Thank you! You comment really helped -- I found a mistake in another part of my program...
[19:04:13] <antononcube> I have another question -- it is about using Raku in Babel org mode. (https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/)
[19:05:08] <antononcube> Does someone here use Babel org-mode and Raku? I read somewhere that Raku is supposed to supported in Babel, but I do not think it is.
[19:09:26] <antononcube> I found this emacs-Lisp  definition: https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-03/msg00636.html . And with some little tweaking I made it work in Aquamacs. It looks like though the author, Tim Van den Langenbergh, has abandoned any efforts in that direction and deleted / removed the corresponding files from hist GitHub repository.

[19:30:43] <Altreus> oh, no it doesn't because you didn't put a space after the 6!
[19:30:44] <gfldex> I tried to shoehown a 6 into that vim command.

[23:57:37] <Xliff> I am now getting this error: 
[23:57:38] <Xliff> Cannot modify an immutable Block (-> |c { #`(Block|948...)
[23:57:38] <Xliff> at /home/cbwood/Projects/p6-GIO/lib/GIO/Roles/AppInfo.pm6 (GIO::Roles::AppInfo):429
[23:59:04] <Xliff> That error points here: https://github.com/Xliff/p6-GIO/blob/master/lib/GIO/Roles/AppInfo.pm6#L429
[23:59:14] <Xliff> This is a regression from last week's Raku.
