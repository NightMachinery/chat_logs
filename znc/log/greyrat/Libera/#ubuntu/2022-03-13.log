[06:47:06] <sarahzrf> Hi
[06:47:20] <sarahzrf> I need help un-hosing my ubuntu VPS
[06:48:13] <sarahzrf> i had left it un-upgraded for a very long time—it was on bionic—and i tried to do-release-upgrade and got some python errors in the middle saying like KeyError: "The cache has no package named 'ubuntu-minimal'"
[06:48:49] <sarahzrf> i googled and found this, and like an idiot i did the thing suggested in the first answer without really thinking it thru https://superuser.com/questions/1400979/do-release-upgrade-fails-with-keyerror-the-cache-has-no-package-named-ubuntu
[06:50:13] <sarahzrf> this resulted in having a ton of new packages to install; after some upgrading, i tried to do-release-upgrade again, which failed, demanding "Please install all available updates for your release before upgrading."—i think the previous half-complete do-release-upgrade may have finished changing the repo listings so that it was trying to install focal packages now, but it was refusing to get
[06:50:15] <sarahzrf> everything up to date
[06:50:38] <sarahzrf> i tried using apt dist-upgrade to coax it into installing the held back packages, but that just made it start removing random stuff
[06:50:49] <sarahzrf> now i seem to be stuck in half-upgraded limbo with a bunch of packages removed
[06:50:51] <sarahzrf> anyone have advice??

[07:18:15] <leftyfb> sarahzrf: If you do, I would highly suggest using scp or rsync to backup all of your files and configs. If there's databases, dump them and rsync those as well. Then rebuild from scratch and restore from backup. That will be the quickest, easiest and cleanest solution. That isn't to say your situation is unrecoverable, it might be. But in my opinion, isn't worth the time and effort.

[10:11:31] <Bashing-om> dirtcastle_: In the recovery menu is the "clean" option that trys to make free space. Worth a shot before having to mount and manually see what you can remove from '/' .

If I'm correct this is equivalent to 199.223.232.0/11 but applying, $sudo ufw deny from 199.223.232.0/11 will result in a adress "normalisation" to 199.192.0.0/11.  Why is that ?

[14:47:08] <moa5505> I want to run 3 scripts at startup. One to disable the middleclick on my touchpad, one to apply a TDP limit to my CPU and another to apply an undervolt.
[14:47:08] <moa5505> I tried to use the default autostart menu on lubuntu and add those commands, but they don’t work because the last two need to be executed as root.
[14:47:09] <moa5505> So I created a new service with User = root, but this new service only launches 1 of the 3 commands. I checked the logs and apparently the middleclick disable cannot be applied because the service is executed before “xinput” can be executed, which is fine it makes sense, I guess this one can be added on the startup menu since it doesn't require
[14:47:09] <moa5505> root. But the two last commands seem to be executed correctly and return proper return values in the logs, but when I check if the TDP limit was applied, it wasn’t for some reason...

[14:48:36] <cbreak> when you start a script via systemd, you can extend the script with logging, to verify if it has run. systemctl status should tell you that then.
[14:48:42] <gry> You can set up sudo to not require sudo password for a particular user for a particular command, and I think it would resolve the issue.
[14:48:52] <cbreak> this will of course not ensure that what you run will actually work, just that it is executed.

[14:52:36] <moa5505> It is executed

[14:52:52] <cbreak> yes. You said that before.
[14:53:03] <cbreak> so it's not a problem with the starting itself.
[14:53:19] <cbreak> it's a problem with either what the script does, or when it does it, or what happens afterwards.
[14:53:20] <moa5505> Where can I past logs ?

[15:15:33] <cbreak> is your code executed?
[15:15:36] <moa5505> yes
[15:15:38] <cbreak> good.
[15:15:40] <cbreak> so it works.
[15:15:41] <cbreak> Q.E.D.
[15:15:44] <moa5505> mdr
[15:15:47] <moa5505> t'es con en fait
[15:16:05] <cbreak> since logging proved that your code is started, the problem is not starting your code
[15:16:21] <cbreak> next step is to find out why your code doesn't do what you want.
[15:16:26] <moa5505> It runs, it returns that the TDP modifications were done, but if I check if they really were there are no modifications
[15:16:27] <cbreak> and to solve the problem.
[15:16:34] <cbreak> so, as I said above:
[15:16:45] <cbreak> check that the settings have been applied right afterwards
[15:16:49] <moa5505> Why ?
[15:16:52] <cbreak> I told you
[15:16:56] <cbreak> twice already...
[15:17:03] <cbreak> to find out if your settings have been applied
[15:17:12] <cbreak> if they have, then they were reverted later.
[15:17:25] <cbreak> if they hvae not, then there's some problem with setting them itself.
[15:17:43] <cbreak> beause, obviously, when you check much later, the settings are not what you wanted to set them to, right?
[15:17:55] <cbreak> so either they never were set to begin with, or they were set back.

[18:47:20] <tomreyn> ph88: like all other flavors, lubuntu can install in either (legacy) bios or EFI mode, if your mainboard supports both modes for booting. which one you boot the lubuntu installer in decides which boot mode the system will be installed for. you can use gpt partitioning in either mode. an 1 MB bios_grub partition is only needed for (legacy) bios booting, and would be created by the installer (booted in (legacy) BIOS mode) when it sees
[18:47:20] <tomreyn> unpartitioned space on the target disk. an ESP partition is only needed for UEFI booting and would be created by the installer (booted in UEFI mode) when it sees unpartitioned space on the target disk.

[23:26:59] <jhutchins> semitones: Given that a certain portion of these reports are invalid because the failure is something the tester did rather than an innate problem with the hardware (or drivers), the databases are pretty useless.
[23:27:08] <gry> semitones, see also http://www.h-node.org site — when you click 'Search', at the bottom it has a textbox where you can copy/paste your hardware list from a command. See if all your components are already in the catalogue. If they aren't, you can add them there.
