OpenGL turns off and it says: OpenGL compositing (the default) has crashed KWin in the past. This was most likely due to a driver bug.

[06:58:37] <alschaapman> beelzebuzz: But a menu would not display if the user configured a boot entry to load automatically. That's why I asked.
[06:58:50] <Compy> I double checked fstab, and the locations are mapped by label, not by uuid. blkid does return the right labels on each nvme partition. Regarding refind - the menu is set with a 0 timeout, so it usually hangs on the menu until I select a boot option.
[06:59:02] <alschaapman> Meaning that the black screen could indicate that the boot failed after rEFInd loaded an OS, not before rEFInd executed.
[06:59:27] <Compy> Correct, if I had timeout set to -1

[06:59:56] <beelzebuzz> i cant recall if refind-install sets the refind entry as the first one. dont think it does

[07:01:04] <alschaapman> Because if it SAYS "rEFInd," that almost certainly means it's a NVRAM boot entry, and probably the firmware is trying to find the rEFInd executable on the old SSD, not the new one
[07:01:38] <alschaapman> If it says something like "NVMe SSD," then selecting that entry should attempt to load the EFI binary at the fallback location on that drive
[07:02:25] <alschaapman> I haven't used rEFInd recently, but it may create a UEFI boot entry in NVRAM even if you install it to the fallback location
[07:02:25] <Compy> alschaapman: Good question: "rEFInd Boot Manager[]ubuntu[]UEFI OS (TS128GMTE110S)" and "rEFInd Boot Manager (TS128GMTE110S)" - I've tried both, and the []s in the first entry are likely special characters.

[09:07:04] <Herb> I'm getting some serious performance issues upgrading from mesa 21.1.1-1 to 21.1.1-2. Am I correct in believing that the difference between these two packages is caused by the package maintainer and not by changes to Mesa itself?
[09:08:16] <thurstylark> it's a rebuild 
[09:08:23] <thurstylark> there's already a newer version out anyways
[09:08:32] <Herb> That newer version has the same problem
[09:08:38] <Herb> So who do I report this to?
[09:08:48] <mpan> Herb: pkgrel changes imply either PKGBUILD changes or a need to rebuild.
[09:09:23] <thurstylark> the commit is explicit about why: "upgpkg: mesa 21.1.1-2: LLVM 12 rebuild"
[09:09:38] <alschaapman> Herb: pkgrel is anything after the last -, if you didn't know (so -1 to -2, in this instance)
[09:09:45] <Herb> This is the difference between 1500fps and 25fps on my system with Minecraft
[09:10:29] <alschaapman> And yeah, it's generally hotfixes that are Arch specific, and require an Arch-specific packaging change, or else it's just rebuilt against something else. But a pkgrel change generally implies no change to the underlying source code
[09:11:03] <Herb> So in theory if I rebuild the latest version of mesa with the old version of llvm, it might solve my problem?
[09:11:16] <alschaapman> Herb: If you're confident that the problem was introduced with the package update from -1 to -2, then it would (theoretically) be an Arch-specific problem, and you should report the bug to the packager
[09:11:58] <alschaapman> I would just caveat that you should be sure you've ruled out any possibility that it's an upstream problem before you report the bug that way
[09:12:27] <Herb> I'm pretty sure I ruled out every other possibility, but I will share the exact process I followed to reach my conclusion
[09:12:33] <Herb> when I file the report

[13:04:39] <setzer22> Hi! I'm having trouble with a system update. Apparently, newest blender version requires openimageio-2.2.15.1-1, but this package does not seem to be in any of the mirrors (returns 404). Is this some kind of temporary issue?

[13:25:19] <WinterStar> Good morning folks. When using BTRFS, would you recommend the discard=async mount option over the fstrim.timer or vice versa, with the goal of future-proofness and SSD longevity?
[13:26:49] *** Joins: Tom^ (~Tom^@user/tom/x-0773808)
[13:27:04] <WinterStar> The wiki doesn't appear to give any details on why you would choose one method over the other and/or what the consequences are 'under the hood'...
[13:28:25] <grawity> dunno, I think it might depend on how the SSD handles TRIM internally
[13:28:46] <grawity> but my general understanding that discard=async should be fine because that's more or less how NTFS handles it on Windows

[13:30:01] <WinterStar> interesting. I didn't know that about NTFS
[13:30:45] <WinterStar> According to Phoronix, this async option was developed by facebook engineers and works well on their servers. Other references seem to state that they prefer the fstrim.timer slightly. 
[13:30:48] <grawity> (Windows does also have an equivalent of fstrim.timer -- weekly schedule as part of the "defragmenter" app)
[13:30:58] <grawity> tbh I'd have fstrim.timer anyway, for other non-btrfs filesystems I might have mounted

[13:36:32] <grawity> the slide before it is kinda amazing, though -- (pre-TRIM-era) SSDs literally trying to understand filesystem structures in order to know which space is free

[13:39:15] <WinterStar> Indeed. And MS seems to admit that that doesn't work for their proprietary and evolving NTFS because of its proprietary nature :)
[13:39:35] <grawity> not really; you'd have the same situation with btrfs or xfs
[13:39:45] <grawity> do you really want your SSD to require any specific filesystem
[13:40:04] <grawity> though, I suspect it *would* work with NTFS, since the free-space bitmap isn't something that changes much
[13:40:16] <WinterStar> No. this seems to be a hacky and dangerous firmware clunkyness

[17:46:36] <SysGhost> chep: for the last part of the question. No... but Yes... there's no official way to install multiple versions at once. you can however downgrade to a previous version, but that is unsupported and is likely to cause breakage in other packages. Although you *can* make your own package with a different prefix, and have destination changed or files renamed to coexist on the same file system. But that has a different can ow worms to solve once past that 
[17:46:37] <SysGhost> step.

[18:36:44] <anV0> Is it worth a shot to switch to pipewire if pulseaudio is working fine? :D
[18:37:10] <jonathon> pipewire works well enough for me, but if pipewire does what you want then i don't think there's a specific reason to change
[18:37:26] <jonathon> wait, the second one there should be pulseaudio

[20:24:39] <baltazar> just checked, the plasma group contains more packages than the dependencies of plasma-meta, but seemingly all extra packages in it would be installed anyway, since they are required by other packages in plasma-meta
[20:24:46] <arojas> there is no KDE group or package
[20:26:17] <baltazar> generally I think all *something* group and *something*-meta package pairs are meant to install the same stuff, e.g. plasma, kde-utilities, kde-applications, etc

[21:17:29] <niki> I don't think 65 °C is bad, it might just be laptop cooling and stuff being close together and nvme getting hot anyway. if your laptop turns down from overheat then you can can clean dust or replace thermal paste i guess

[23:28:53] <ailepet> Is there something I can check on my current user session in the meantime?

[23:33:32] <Namarrgon> you do you
[23:33:34] <mingdao> I am wanting to use my workstation where I had AnyDesk before, rather than my laptop.
[23:33:39] <mingdao> Yes, I will, thanks buddy.

[23:35:21] <nattiestnate> hi, i hope you don't mind me asking again: i'm currently still trying to write a udev rule that runs a script (which uses xrandr) to configure my monitors when a new display is plugged/unplugged. apparently it can't access my $DISPLAY and $XAUTHORITY variables directly but i don't want to hardcode it in the udev rule or the script. i've asked this before, and someone pointed me to the
[23:35:23] <nattiestnate> /proc/.../environ files, which has got me somewhere, but i'm failing to figure out a way to make it display only the $DISPLAY i'm currently in, instead of all the $DISPLAYS my user is currently using
