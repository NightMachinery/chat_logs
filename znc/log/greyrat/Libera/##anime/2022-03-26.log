[01:00:46] <amigojapan> Hi
[01:00:52] <emmeka> Canadian distances probably don't make much sense to a European, but he's a day's travel from the Pacific.
[01:00:57] <amigojapan> I am up early
[01:01:30] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: morning
[01:02:09] <emmeka> Zoidberg I wonder if your "smelt" and our smelt are the same thing
[01:03:21] <emmeka> there is a fish of the North American Great Lakes called smelt, it is typically netted on beaches in spring. Usually people pan-fry them whole, or pickle them.
[01:03:44] *** Joins: hauki (~esox@user/hauki)
[01:07:12] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: I doubt a lot is a day's travel from sea in Europe
[01:07:23] <emmeka> Urchin[emacs] the scale of this country can be hard to grasp, for example, there is twice as much distance between MootPoot and I as there is between Berlin and Moscow.
[01:07:42] <MootPoot> emmeka: a day if you have no rest at all
[01:07:44] <emmeka> and it's not like we live at polar opposite ends of the country
[01:07:44] <MootPoot> via road
[01:07:53] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: well, I gave MootPoot a useful rule of thumb
[01:07:54] <MootPoot> effectively its like ~2 days for a truck taking a stop
[01:07:54] <emmeka> MootPoot yeah. a solid day of driving.
[01:08:06] <MootPoot> and the downtime of logistics and refueling
[01:08:10] <MootPoot> and loading etc
[01:08:20] <MootPoot> and thats absolute best case
[01:08:38] <MootPoot> last time I drove through to BC it was 1.5 days
[01:08:40] <Urchin[emacs]> for me, reaching the sea is something I do on foot
[01:08:50] <MootPoot> opensea TM
[01:09:21] <emmeka> I guess even the Canadian metric of "a day's distance" is probably weird to grasp, because that usually means "amount of distance you can travel from dawn to dusk"
[01:09:45] <emmeka> by car, ofc
[01:11:16] <emmeka> for me, if I was starting where I was born, it would take me 2 solid days driving to reach the next province west.

[02:09:54] <DaPinkOne> i'm really hoping we get a second season
[02:10:12] <emmeka> wonder how far ahead the manga is
[02:10:32] <lastonestanding> why do people hype it so much?
[02:11:07] <DaPinkOne> lastonestanding, it's got a strong female lead, and a male character who isn't just a bland kirito-like stand-in
[02:11:12] <emmeka> why not watch it and find out
[02:11:27] <emmeka> the characters are very well done, and it's got ~the scene~ that I was talking about
[02:11:35] <DaPinkOne> it's writing is pretty good
[02:11:53] <lastonestanding> strong female? mmh sure
[02:12:03] <lastonestanding> more like a sex object
[02:13:00] <DaPinkOne> nah, she's attractive sure, but she has opinions and personality. The show is pretty light on fanservice. If they wanted her to be just a sex object, they'd be more overt about it.
[02:13:02] <emmeka> lastonestanding the main characters are very unique, the show, despite being entirely trope-aware and often make fun of anime tropes (in the fictional series within the series...) is almost devoid of tropes itself.
[02:13:25] <emmeka> she's kind of the opposite of your median moeblob sex object
[02:13:31] <lastonestanding> dense male MC is not a trope?
[02:13:45] <emmeka> he's not very dense. if anything, he's the opposite of dense.
[02:13:48] <DaPinkOne> nah, if anything I'd say he's shy and she's dense
[02:14:00] <DaPinkOne> in that she's kindof oblivious to her own actions
[02:14:51] <DaPinkOne> it's written in a way that those perspectives(shy and oblivious), seem reasonable from their perspectives though
[02:15:30] <lastonestanding> okay
[02:15:33] <DaPinkOne> just give it the 3 episode trial, and see if you like it
[02:15:46] <lastonestanding> well, I do think it's an okay show
[02:16:00] <lastonestanding> which is not light on fanservice
[02:16:07] <lastonestanding> why you claim that it is?
[02:16:19] <DaPinkOne> because it is
[02:16:20] <emmeka> it's... light by ecchi standards?
[02:16:26] <emmeka> which isn't saying much, but
[02:16:30] <emmeka> it is at least the truth
[02:16:52] <lastonestanding> ecchi is an extreme
[02:17:25] <DaPinkOne> ecchi is kindof par for the course for harem shows, and romance shows usually toe the line
[02:17:33] <emmeka> but really what super fanservicey scenes did we get. we even get MC not wearing an outfit *because* it would be too fanservicey
[02:18:19] <amigojapan> Ok Fenderbassist I am going to try to sleep again 
[02:18:26] <DaPinkOne> g'night amigojapan 
[02:18:35] <amigojapan> Ty DaPinkOne 
[02:19:00] <DaPinkOne> emmeka, I guess there's the measurement scene, but that's pretty tame
[02:19:11] <emmeka> yeah, there's that, early on. but then after that?
[02:19:21] <DaPinkOne> I dunno, honestly
[02:19:26] <emmeka> I mean it's clearly there to be bait for the viewer, that scene
[02:19:32] <DaPinkOne> there's ~the scene~ I guess
[02:19:37] <emmeka> ~the scene~, true
[02:19:44] <emmeka> but is that fanservice
[02:19:46] <amigojapan> Ok I will leave now before I lose my ability to sleep, see you later Fenderbassist 
[02:19:51] *** Quits: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.helmsley.irccloud.com) ()
[02:19:52] <emmeka> or just fanservice for the kokoro
[02:20:35] <lastonestanding> uhm
[02:20:36] <DaPinkOne> I suppose it could be construed as fanservice. It's plot-relevant, but they could've handled it how they did similar in Scum's Wish
[02:20:48] <lastonestanding> it's about a sexy cosplayer... and that alone is fanservice!
[02:20:59] <emmeka> now THAT is objectifying :P
[02:21:17] <DaPinkOne> lastonestanding, she's a woman wearing clothes, so it's fanservice?
[02:21:26] <lastonestanding> sure
[02:21:52] <DaPinkOne> we're gonna need to be a bit more specific here, because every show with a female character fits that description.
[02:21:52] <lastonestanding> or is fanservice only limited to nudity?
[02:23:00] <DaPinkOne> I usually reserve fanservice for overt pandering camera shots which serve no narrative purpose, and exist only to pander to the fans(panty shots come to mind)
[02:23:25] <DaPinkOne> or scenes/tropes like the "accidental bathroom/shower walkin" situation
[02:24:00] <DaPinkOne> which are bullshit from a writing/narrative perspective, and the author and director know it
[02:24:13] <lastonestanding> I did like the naked loli scene though
[02:24:49] <DaPinkOne> which ep was that?
[02:25:14] <lastonestanding> when they first met
[02:25:19] <lastonestanding> in the bathroom
[02:25:27] <emmeka> ???
[02:25:40] <lastonestanding> she went to his house all wet
[02:25:47] <emmeka> ohhh
[02:25:53] <lastonestanding> right
[02:26:00] <DaPinkOne> ep ~6 I think
[02:26:09] <lastonestanding> wet from the rain!!
[02:27:26] <DaPinkOne> yeah, that's a bit gratuitous. we don't see much, but I'm not a fan of that scene.
[02:27:55] <lastonestanding> I enjoyed it fully :)
[02:27:58] <DaPinkOne> I'd say it is fanservice
[02:28:31] <DaPinkOne> there's no reason to spend as much time on these shots as they are.
[02:28:49] <lastonestanding> but it's from the MC's perspective
[02:28:51] <DaPinkOne> *there's no *narrative* reason
[02:28:57] <lastonestanding> so it's important
[02:29:14] <lastonestanding> we simply see what the MC is experiencing
[02:30:18] <DaPinkOne> atleast they move on quickly, and don't have the stereotypical violent reaction
[02:32:29] <DaPinkOne> it does look like they weave in a narrative reason for the scene here
[02:33:24] <lastonestanding> isn't it a trope though?
[02:33:34] <DaPinkOne> so I'll concede the point there. I still think it's fanservice, but they wrote it in reasonably well
[02:33:49] <DaPinkOne> yes, it's a trope
[02:35:30] <Urchin[emacs]> the point is, IMO, it's not full of fanservice
[02:36:24] <lastonestanding> correct
[02:36:44] <lastonestanding> but it's not really light on it
[02:37:13] <lastonestanding> especially since it centers around a sexy cosplayer!
[02:37:23] <lastonestanding> and there's other hot girls on top of that
[02:38:04] <Bco1981> so weird being in a hotel
[02:38:14] <lastonestanding> you have corona?
[02:38:40] <Bco1981> no, some family members on my fathers side has 50 year anniversary tomorrow
[02:38:42] <NotNew> hotels are fun if you hang around the lobby you might meet donald trump
[02:38:49] <Bco1981> no thanks
[02:39:15] <lastonestanding> why don't you celebrate via zoom meeting?
[02:39:17] <lastonestanding> it's much safer
[02:39:38] <DaPinkOne> lastonestanding, my point is that just 'cause there are "hot girls", doesn't imply it's "full of fanservice"
[02:39:50] <Bco1981> yeah, i would have liked that. you can turn down the volume on all the chatter going on.
[02:39:57] <NotNew> i lived with 3 simblings that had covid but I never caught it myself. Covid be getting prickly on me eyes
[02:40:17] <DaPinkOne> we've got two scenes which arguably count so far, and that's a pretty light amount. Both scenes aren't clumsily shoehorned in either
[02:40:39] <lastonestanding> DaPinkOne: yes, it's not full or light... it's somewhere in the middle
[02:41:11] <DaPinkOne> lastonestanding, we must've seen very different swathes of anime, 'cause this is pretty light comparatively

[03:35:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah, basically you designate a machine as the master for the UPS which exposes a network server. Computers try to shut down when they udpate state from server and get told to.
[03:36:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And then UPS controller tells UPS to kill line power after a timer, then shuts itself down before that timer runs out.
[03:36:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Power comes back up, UPS restores line power.

[03:37:23] <topitimah> Hello?
[03:37:42] <MootPoot> okay, so according to the UPS display - full stress test + my 110w montitor is about 700w
[03:37:54] <MootPoot> which means I can plug my side monitors into it as well
[03:38:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> iirc the way it works is that it tries to restart the UPS, it prevents power coming back during the shutdown sequence from leaving your everything dead.
[03:38:04] <MootPoot> they are around 60w each
[03:38:06] *** Joins: bxgelsan (~bxgelsan@user/bxgelsan)
[03:38:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That requires configuration, obviously, but it's a relatively common NUT setup. There'
[03:38:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There's mention in its faq/manual & some blogs about it.
[03:38:45] <MootPoot> which leaves about 80w of leeway 
[03:38:48] *** Parts: topitimah (~User_Abso@103.119.141.173) ()

[03:39:26] <MootPoot> if I plugged everything into it
[03:39:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> A bit much for a 24/7 load for a device, but you could try it.
[03:39:57] <MootPoot> well, idle load is 300w
[03:40:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Not sure if peak load from restore wouldn't kick it right back down from overload.

[03:54:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> hauki: I'd use SSDs. The lesser cooling load on AC in summer would be great.
[03:55:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It'd also not mean I'm wasting 5n watt on spinning heaters only to AC it out.
[03:55:18] <Jigsy> SSDs aren't good for archiving, though.
[03:55:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Jigsy: Mostly because they're overprice per TB
[03:55:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *overpriced
[03:55:37] <Jigsy> No, that's not why.
[03:55:44] <Jigsy> Because they need to be turned on once in a while.
[03:56:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Jigsy: Flash memory erasure isn't nearly as much an issue. Do you really trust minimal-cost HDDs to turn back on after 5 years inert?
[03:56:06] <Jigsy> Otherwise charge islost.
[03:56:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I expect them to jam.
[03:56:10] <hauki> I don't do AC either. 9 months of the years its freezing anyway.
[03:56:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> hauki: I sadly don't have that benefit.
[03:56:29] <Jigsy> Canada h-- wait, Canada's cold 12 months of the year.
[03:56:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Jigsy: Only some areas.
[03:56:40] <DaPinkOne> Aurora_v_kosmose, I've got five HDDs, and I turn em on every few years. haven't had issues
[03:56:45] <MootPoot> we have two seasons here
[03:56:48] <MootPoot> winter, and construction
[03:56:54] <Jigsy> I backup in threes.
[03:57:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Construction is accompanied by heatwaves isn'it?
[03:57:03] <Jigsy> Anime, loli porn, etc.

[03:58:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In any case, my main use would be for active NAS.
[03:58:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Backing up on tape or HDDs is fine and would use less power.

[04:03:52] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: unfortunately yes
[04:03:56] <MootPoot> heatwaves
[04:04:01] <MootPoot> the only reason why I need an AC
[04:04:16] <MootPoot> I literally stop working properly if the temp is above 28C
[04:05:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I can survive. Provided a constant intake of iced coffee.
[04:05:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> As you can imagine, that's not particularly conducive to sleep.
[04:05:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Iced tea works too.
[04:05:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In any case, iced fluids.
[04:06:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And constant drinking doesn't lend itself well to sleep. Worse still if it's caffeinated.
[04:11:50] <Jigsy> [23:35:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> As you can imagine, that's not particularly conducive to sleep.

[07:08:42] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I would be the yen will bounce back eventually, I think it may be cause they printed a lot of yen recently
[07:08:59] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: they even called it "the magical money tree"
[07:09:26] <ButterNoodle> but the death of the dollar is coming soon.. so getting rid of it is probably a good idea

[07:10:02] <ButterNoodle> naa it will just not be worth anything
[07:11:18] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: in Japan they have an interesting thing (which I never owned) they have  a gold storage bank, which your gold is guaranteed, you just take home a piece of papaer, which can be reissued if it gets burnt
[07:11:39] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: you own the gold in the storage bank
[07:11:47] <ButterNoodle> so u buy gold and an institution holds on to it?

[07:17:01] <jessedesu2> I don't think gold will melt in a house fire

[08:47:37] <MootPoot> for some reason the windows server 2022 download is broken but the windows server 2019 is working fine

[08:49:09] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: for lightning strikes?
[08:49:20] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: delete both
[08:49:33] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: what do u mean water?
[08:49:37] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: I guess -my coax is underground and its too far from the UPS so I didn't plug it in there
[08:49:46] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: how would u even know if its water tho?
[08:49:47] <amigojapan> MootPoot: lol Windows server must have crashed it's own server
[08:49:54] <ButterNoodle> yes
[08:50:13] <MootPoot> for some reason the 2022 download keeps failing or going super slow like 100kbps
[08:50:21] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: so.. from modem to router?
[08:50:21] <MootPoot> but 2019 is like BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

[08:52:19] <amigojapan> dont you guys get junk mail in your posbox? is that illlegal in the US?
[08:52:21] <ButterNoodle> should go between the modem and ur router

[09:27:10] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, it's all about personal responsibility, eh? You run a shit OS for a server and that's absolutely fine as long as you're okay with it.
[09:27:23] <Sapphirus> We're free to mock you for it.
[09:27:35] <amigojapan> I see MootPoot, how about mono then?
[09:27:38] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yeah I know, its the same anywhere?

[09:28:44] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: mock me all you want - I mean, its even more reason to run it in front of you :3
[09:29:01] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: but I tried one month of hulu and it was terrible
[09:29:11] <amigojapan> DunceCotus:much worse than netflix
[09:29:12] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: lel
[09:29:19] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, You openly mock yourself when you talk about it, so I don't even need to say much on my part.
[09:29:28] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its crap innit
[09:29:44] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: surely Netflix would have bought more Futurama..
[09:29:51] <DunceCotus> maybe Hulu offered the most money
[09:29:54] <Sapphirus> ButterNoodle has said most of what I would've said, anyway.
[09:30:01] <DunceCotus> cause they're desperate right now I suspect
[09:30:05] <DunceCotus> (Hulu)
[09:30:19] <MootPoot> amigojapan: haven't looked into mono
[09:31:12] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the only series I know hulu has that are kind of hulu bait are that an game of thrones
[09:31:37] <amigojapan> MootPoot: its easier to install than windows
[09:31:48] <DunceCotus> Game of Thrones was HBO/HBOMax I thought?
[09:32:19] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: in Japan hulu carried GOT, I dont think we have HBO
[09:32:49] <DunceCotus> ah
[09:33:27] <MootPoot> amigojapan: the application isen't built in mono afaik
[09:33:45] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it still may run on it tho
[09:33:57] <MootPoot> eh
[09:34:01] <MootPoot> it took like 2min to install
[09:34:05] <MootPoot> the instance is already running
[09:36:46] <MootPoot> alright , server software downloading
[09:36:52] <MootPoot> time to wait again for a 120gb download
[09:38:20] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you would have watied much less installing mono
[09:38:34] <MootPoot> if it works on mono...
[09:38:39] <MootPoot> which isen't supported
[09:38:42] <amigojapan> it probably does
[09:38:55] <amigojapan> mono runs almost any .net stuff
[09:39:23] <MootPoot> sure, but I don't want to deal with random edge cases running it on something it was never designed to run on
[09:39:36] <amigojapan> ok
[09:41:05] <MootPoot> out of the 4 games I want servers for 3 of them have linux support or steamcmd
[09:41:15] <MootPoot> only this one is windows only
[09:41:25] <amigojapan> I see
[09:42:08] <amigojapan> MootPoot: cant yu run it on that , I dont know the name CLI only "windows" system?
[09:42:34] <MootPoot> windows server does have a cli only mode
[09:42:44] <amigojapan> right

[09:43:03] <amigojapan> that sounds better

[09:43:11] <MootPoot> with gui and running windows
[09:43:18] <amigojapan> I see
[09:43:26] <MootPoot> so thats why it has no linux support

[09:53:25] <MootPoot> should make it 25 tbh

[11:35:25] <BillyZane> jessedesu2, it's getting amazing reviews, it's a gigantic 12.4" super amoled display

[11:36:08] <ButterNoodle> I think so..
[11:36:09] <Sadale> milkshake, ButterNoodle has shit ton of monitors there. Like at the front, at the back, at the sides. All of the monitors were facing him

[11:36:18] <BillyZane> jessedesu2, it's not better than ipad pro for art stuff, because the ipad still has better apps, but the hardware it self is getting more praise. the pen and display especially
[11:36:41] <ButterNoodle> jessedesu2: I'm not worried.. I'll have btc and gold
[11:36:45] <jessedesu2> The Samsung pen is gud?

[11:40:46] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, i don't think the world will ever stop using USD. biden was recently making very strong remarks about saudi arabia, talks of turning it in to a pariah on account of the killing of khashoggi. i think they were 'thinking about' accepting yuan as payment was just a threat, but an empty one, they peg their currency so the US-dollar so they would suffer as well, i doubt they will go yuan
[11:41:20] <Zoidberg> BillyZane: I remember you were talking about getting samsung tablet some time ago.
[11:41:33] <BillyZane> Zoidberg, i have been thinking about getting a tablet forever

[11:44:38] <Zoidberg> what will happen after Putin and Xi Jinping die?
[11:44:47] <BillyZane> jessedesu2, china has a very successful propaganda effort in the US. the chinese use movies, and their rapid economic development to make people think "china's rise is inevitable. they are winning, so we should join them." they want to win a war without fighting it. there are many good reasons to believe that will not be the case.

[11:48:24] <jessedesu2> China has the lead in AI

[11:49:33] <BillyZane> jessedesu2, i don't know if that will change in the future. but i can see a scenario where batteries play a more important roll, and the need for large quantities of fossil fuel to keep your war economy going is not as necessary

[11:51:34] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, we'll probably not have solar powered tanks, but it could be possible to have autonomous hydrogen fueled mobile rocket launchers. but even that might not be necessary if you can just reduce your overall dependence. for example, electrifying vehicles

[11:52:46] <ButterNoodle> well if ur already gonna stuff an nuke in someones ass..
[11:53:43] <BillyZane> the USA versus China... the USA is like on high-ground. it has two oceans, friendly neighbors. china's surrounded by antagonists, it's boxed in. it's developed eastern half is exposed to attack from everywhere. it's not going to win a war
[11:54:00] <jessedesu2> That's like an Indian name or something.  Anukinmaiass

[12:01:35] <BillyZane> jessedesu2, there's an aspect to china that needs to be understood, and that is that xijin ping is a student of how communist regimes fall
[12:02:06] <BillyZane> jessedesu2, and the theory goes that once you start to liberalize a communist system, it unravels on it's own. there's no half way liberalization
[12:02:23] <jessedesu2> Students of history still can't change the repetitive nature of history
[12:02:24] <ButterNoodle> its pretty arrogant to thing that without the US, china would fail..
[12:03:06] <jessedesu2> I love Chinese food
[12:03:36] <jessedesu2> I would fail if it weren't for 2 nearby Chinese restaurants next to my post office
[12:03:38] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, you mean if the USA were to disappear, or if the USA were to kick china out of the global system
[12:06:53] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, i don't think china will fail, but i think that their political system is going to hold them back for their next phase of growth. totalitarian states are great for cutting red tape and building high speed rail. they were able to move 100 million people to build the three gorges dam, flood 5000 years of history, try doing that in the USA. the problem comes when you're trying to build a dynamic, innovative economy. the venture capital 
[12:06:53] <BillyZane> spending in china is much lower than in the USA, and other liberal democracies. anyone who has money in china will have the sense to invest outside the country, where it can't be taken from you by the party
[12:06:56] <ButterNoodle> I dont think we have the ability to do either.. but china could start new business their neighbor and OPEC.. and their manufacturing pressure could change the world that the US does business in..

[12:14:38] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, the USA is far in advance of china, technologically. and you must realize, the USA has control over most of the world, the oceans as well. the economies of much of the developed world are integrated through multinational corporations.
[12:14:58] <Kill-Animals> jessedesu2: Whatup B?

[12:15:30] <Kill-Animals> jessedesu2: Cat > Dawg
[12:15:39] <jessedesu2> Do you kill animals
[12:15:47] <BillyZane> so when you look at china's 1.3 billion population versus america's .35, it's a bit misleading, because you have to consider the entire economic sphere, which includes western europe, japan, taiwan, south korea, etc.
[12:16:05] <Kill-Animals> jessedesu2: I was thinking actually lately, to maybe go around adopting pitbulls and killing them.

[12:16:38] <ButterNoodle> " through multinational corporations" <- they do not give a shit about the US.. and look at how many have a china interest in them
[12:16:48] <jessedesu2> I killed a bee at work
[12:16:51] <Kill-Animals> jessedesu2: Are you not aware of the pitbull meme?
[12:17:00] <jessedesu2> It clung on to me
[12:17:06] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, the way multinational corporations operate, there's collaboration among research labs throughout all these territories. as an example in the chip industry, the lenses are made in germany, the machines are built in the netherlands, the lasers are build in the US, and the taiwanese and south koreans operate them
[12:17:09] <jessedesu2> No
[12:17:17] <Kill-Animals> jessedesu2: Maybe you smell like a flower
[12:17:47] <ButterNoodle> BillyZane: yea tell me again how all the shit I buy on amazon and from walmart is not made in china
[12:17:54] <jessedesu2> I smell like dead skin
[12:18:02] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, so china isn't just against the united states for dominance. the USA has already integrated these areas
[12:18:08] <ButterNoodle> BillyZane: yea tell me again how all the shit I buy on dog shit consumer credit is not ran by a chinese company
[12:18:19] <Kill-Animals> jessedesu2: Its a dark set of memes, but in short, it turns out that statistically Pitbulls are by and large the most dangerous dog breed out there. Constantly responsible for killing infants etc. Very dark. 
[12:18:41] <Kill-Animals> jessedesu2: Dead skin? What happened? Who summoned you?
[12:18:49] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, they're made in china because we allowed them in to the WTO, invested capital inside their country. that doesn't mean they can build a reliable jet engine
[12:18:54] <jessedesu2> I have eczema
[12:19:05] <Kill-Animals> jessedesu2: are you a vegetarian?
[12:19:11] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, even the latest chips are not going to enter china, and they are generations behind the west
[12:19:13] <ButterNoodle> BillyZane: no russia does
[12:19:14] <jessedesu2> No
[12:19:27] <ButterNoodle> and we put them in the corner..
[12:19:28] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, lol, russia is dependent on foreign countries for aircraft parts
[12:19:37] <Kill-Animals> because I would reccomend that you just start killing animals and drinking their blood. It unironically does wonders for your skin.
[12:19:40] <ButterNoodle> ok
[12:19:43] <ButterNoodle> keep ur dollars
[12:19:50] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, i don't get why you're so upset

[12:20:16] <BillyZane> based on what
[12:20:26] <ButterNoodle> literally every line u typed
[12:20:27] <BillyZane> i don't need to be set straight, ButterNoodle
[12:20:32] <ButterNoodle> its ok
[12:20:43] <BillyZane> is it because i'm saying it
[12:20:45] <ButterNoodle> its coming..

[12:26:26] <MootPoot> Stop being hungry 
[12:26:44] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: when the canadian $$ is worth more than the usd
[12:27:14] <ButterNoodle> u cant spell supplies without puppies 
[12:27:16] <ButterNoodle> or wait
[12:27:16] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, i'm curious about your world view
[12:27:23] <ButterNoodle> thats not enough p's
[12:27:26] <Sapphirus> Wrong, when the CAD is the lowest against the greenback, because shit costs more here when it is.
[12:27:58] <ButterNoodle> huh
[12:28:07] <ButterNoodle> I think we are saying the same thing...
[12:28:09] <ButterNoodle> differently
[12:28:20] <jessedesu2> My entire world view is based on 18 years living in so cal and 18 years in SF
[12:28:29] <Sapphirus> Yeah, except you're saying it wrong, ButterNoodle, if that's what you really meant.
[12:28:30] <BillyZane> lol
[12:28:36] <ButterNoodle> if once CAD was word 1.15 USD
[12:28:40] <Sapphirus> CAD being worth more than the USD would mean shit would cost less.
[12:29:06] <Sapphirus> That would be bad for exporters and people looking to liquidate their shit because they need money, like MootPoot.
[12:30:16] <ButterNoodle> guess it depends on how much the piece of rubber dog shit u bought from china is worth in both currencies ya think?
[12:30:19] <BillyZane> jessedesu2, have you heard about the new helicopter engine in development, the GE T901
[12:30:41] <ButterNoodle> BillyZane: some day I'll come to free node and discuss

[12:31:02] * MootPoot bulk orders UPS units and waits
[12:31:11] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, then why discuss it there?

[12:32:15] <BillyZane> jessedesu2, it's pretty interesting. they're using 3D printing and some new ceramic matrix composites. it is claiming to get 50% increase in power while using 25% less fuel
[12:32:25] <jessedesu2> Another really good video
[12:32:36] <jessedesu2> Whoa
[12:33:01] <BillyZane> increased component durability too, lower life cycle costs
[12:33:22] <jessedesu2> I know more about the GE F110
[12:33:34] <jessedesu2> And PW R2800
[12:33:43] <BillyZane> they're going to use it to re-engine the apaches, black hawks, and the future attack reconnistance aircraft
[12:34:25] <BillyZane> jessedesu2, they're having major problems with the P&W F-135
[12:34:33] <MootPoot> BillyZane: those numbers sound like bs
[12:34:45] <BillyZane> i guess everything i say is bullshit these days :D
[12:35:19] <jessedesu2> I didn't even know what the F-35 engine was called
[12:35:20] <MootPoot> Engine makers are extremely happy with 5% better fuel economy for the same power
[12:36:01] <BillyZane> MootPoot, i read it from this link...
[12:36:05] <BillyZane> https://www.geaviation.com/press-release/military-engines/ge-begins-testing-first-t901-turboshaft-engine-us-army

[12:36:28] <MootPoot> Oh
[12:36:44] <BillyZane> maybe he's lying
[12:36:48] <MootPoot> 50% more power compared to the last one 
[12:36:49] <BillyZane> i dunno how long they could keep that lie up
[12:36:57] <MootPoot> And 25% specific fuel 
[12:37:02] <MootPoot> Yeah that makes sense 
[12:37:32] <MootPoot> So its a much larger engine which is more efficient, but overall still uses more fuel then the last one 
[12:37:33] <BillyZane> it's a significant boost, and it shows you how advanced the US is in design and manufacturing
[12:37:55] <BillyZane> the CMC material is pretty impressive
[12:38:00] <MootPoot> Fuel economy and specific fuel economy are very different things :3

[12:42:30] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, you know, if you have a certain world view, or belief, you can see things that corroborate it. a religious person, might for example, see an image of the virgin mary in some object and venerate it, where others might not even notice
[12:42:43] <Kill-Animals> BillyZane: Thanks for reccomending steins gate. I started watching yesterday, and its a really good anime.

[13:55:39] <amigojapan> Yup yup HubertFarnsworth 
[13:55:51] <MootPoot> I need to pee

[13:56:18] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: most women flee this channel quickly
[13:56:29] <HubertFarnsworth> I found an old funny thing you said, would you mind if I quote you on that Kill-Animals?
[13:56:41] <amigojapan> I did not watch mash tho
[13:56:59] <HubertFarnsworth> I mean MootPootg
[13:57:02] <Kill-Animals> HubertFarnsworth: Whats the quote?
[13:57:14] <HubertFarnsworth> Not you, MootPoot*
[13:57:48] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Oddly my respect for mash went up when I heard that the name of their themesong was, "Suicide is painless"
[13:58:04] <amigojapan> Hmm
[13:58:18] <Kill-Animals> It even has lyrics.
[13:59:06] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I think you are going thru an edgy phase in life
[13:59:27] <HubertFarnsworth> Kill-Animals: you know, you don’t need to objectively rank the show and fight for that.
[14:00:28] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: that was a long time ago. Its not about being edgy; my personality is almost holistically centered around meaning. 
[14:00:57] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: remember when I used to do the same shit years ago here?
[14:01:05] <Kill-Animals> And mash as far as sitcoms go, is the most meaningful sitcom probably ever made and ever will be made.
[14:01:41] <amigojapan> Not really HubertFarnsworth 
[14:02:17] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I am willing to give it a go
[14:02:17] <MootPoot> HubertFarnsworth: go ahead 
[14:02:23] <HubertFarnsworth> That’s nice amigojapan, you only remember the good things :p
[14:02:39] <MootPoot> I tried washing mash but 
[14:02:42] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: selective memory?
[14:02:50] <MootPoot> My brain broke 
[14:03:01] <MootPoot> It takes forever for them to do anything 
[14:03:14] <MootPoot> And I also don't really like sitcoms in general 
[14:03:40] <amigojapan> MootPoot: aren't they a clinic in war time Vietnam?
[14:04:00] <amigojapan> That would be slow I bet
[14:04:00] <MootPoot> they are
[14:04:37] <MootPoot> it was about as painful to watch as booting windows 10 from a 5400rpm hdd

[14:05:01] <MootPoot> HubertFarnsworth: lol I remember that
[14:05:03] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: My favourite episode from mash is when Charles ( Later Seasons ) who is this pretentious but talented doctor, brags to his patient that he saved his legs only at the cost of his hand. 
[14:05:37] <amigojapan> I see Kill-Animals 
[14:05:50] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: The patient is ungrateful, because hed rather have his hands, because he is a pianist. 
[14:06:04] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: maybe, I definitely remember being like Kill-Animals.
[14:06:12] <MootPoot> apparentyl I can't even write a binary search
[14:06:19] <MootPoot> maybe I should sleep
[14:06:22] <MootPoot> brain no wurk
[14:06:38] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: my dad wanted to put insurance on his ears, cause he was a piano tuner
[14:06:54] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Thats funny and interesting!
[14:07:06] <HubertFarnsworth> Yeah, go to sleep MootPoot
[14:07:46] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: there was that other edgy person from India long ago. But that was not you
[14:08:00] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: davedoc
[14:08:01] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Anyways the last shot, the patient is borderline suicidal, and so charles brings him to this old piano. The patient thinks hes mocking him, but he brings out this famous composer works designed for one handed soldiers.
[14:08:07] <HubertFarnsworth> Dabedoc!
[14:08:32] <Kill-Animals> Stirring scene. Loved it. The music felt so tragic, but endearing.

[14:50:17] <Kill-Animals> Drama | Horror | Psychological | Sci fi
[14:50:43] <Kill-Animals> From Ootomo Katsuhiro, acclaimed creator of Akira, comes an animated masterpiece; three short stories all put together as a series of Memories. Part one is titled Magnetic Rose, a science fiction tale that tells a chilling story of love, loss, and the unwillingness to forget. Part two is titled Stink Bomb - a tongue-in-cheek story of a chemical researcher who is just looking for a way to get rid of his cold... so why is everybody around him dying? 
[14:50:44] <Kill-Animals> Story three is titled Cannon fodder, and is an introspective tale about modern wars and simply following orders.
[14:51:48] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: if it is sort I may watch it soon
[14:51:50] <Kill-Animals> I loved the first. The second was pretty good. The third I did not care for.

[15:25:01] <DunceCotus> I am aware of them
[15:25:43] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Okay; so in both of them, the "twist" (trope) is that the catholic church are actually the bad guys, and the priests are secretly evil. 
[15:25:59] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: do you like Patlabor
[15:26:04] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: ah

[15:26:34] <Kill-Animals> but that is literally like every single anime that ever depicts the catholic church. I think it would be more interesting if they had a "good catholic church" instead.
[15:26:56] <Kill-Animals> Not because I'm catholic, but because the other trope is so tired and worn out. 
[15:27:06] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: preeeetty sure you're catholic
[15:27:34] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: I am. I also was jewish for awhile.
[15:27:45] * Kill-Animals rubs hands
[15:27:45] <DunceCotus> preeeeeeetty sure you're not jewish
[15:27:47] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: his edgy behaviours, not very good Catholic kid
[15:28:07] <Kill-Animals> Not halachichly jewish
[15:28:15] <Kill-Animals> But converts never are.
[15:28:39] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: what draws you to such denominations?
[15:29:11] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I converted too cause only my dad was Jewish, my mom was Catholic
[15:29:23] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: they are justifiably and logically rationalizeable compared to the alternatives. 
[15:29:58] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: I have no jewish family members. I also don't blame you for converting; Its nice to have an identity like that.
[15:29:59] * DunceCotus scratches head
[15:30:04] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: do you believe the pope is actually the real pope?
[15:30:21] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: You familiar with the talmud at all?
[15:30:32] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: the orthodox still ostracized me tho
[15:30:38] <DunceCotus> I think all religions describe same God
[15:30:55] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: that is why I only accept reformed
[15:31:00] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Did you not convert orthodox?
[15:31:08] <amigojapan> No Kill-Animals 
[15:31:12] <DunceCotus> they used to be combined before the cataclysm that took down the Old Worl
[15:31:13] <DunceCotus> d
[15:31:32] <Kill-Animals> oh well I would have ostracised you as well. I was going through orthodox.
[15:31:49] <DunceCotus> ostrich?
[15:31:56] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you mean orthodox Jews and reform Jews?
[15:32:38] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Ostracize is similar to exile or bannishment.

[15:34:52] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: religion fosters ostracizing activity
[15:35:16] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Yes?
[15:35:17] <DunceCotus> this is the problem with "ordained" power
[15:35:30] <Kill-Animals> Why is this "a problem"?
[15:35:41] <DunceCotus> maybe there is a God but all the modern religions are not gonna touch it
[15:36:24] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: its a problem because it sucks to be ostracized
[15:36:45] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: It also sucks being put in jail. Its not really an argument against jail though.
[15:36:54] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: isn't it?
[15:37:09] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I have gone, they are orthodox. They are hassidic 
[15:37:36] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Did you enjoy it? Chabad is pretty laid back and unprententious for orthodox.
[15:37:53] <DunceCotus> I can see amigojapan with hassidic dreadlocks and hat 
[15:38:03] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals I did not mention details about my life and why to Passover at Chabad 
[15:38:32] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: nope. And to make a more sophisticated point; movements that do not ostracise end up being subverted by corrupting forces, often times the mentally ill.
[15:38:53] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: hmm still to strict for my liking. Like women and men sir separately 
[15:39:07] <Sadale> nya~ :3
[15:39:20] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: that's just an assertion
[15:40:02] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: I like that aspect. Its practical in the worship sense since gazing upon a hot chick while worshipping makes the latter pretty "hard"
[15:40:34] <DunceCotus> if you have to ostracize, your movement is crap
[15:40:46] <DunceCotus> and it may gain power, but its dirty power
[15:40:52] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: by the way Shabbat shalom 
[15:40:55] <DunceCotus> exclusive use of the disjunction
[15:41:04] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: It follows from just basic reasoning. Look ath the lgbt movement; its the most accepting movement out there which will grant people an identity and community for anyone at all under the sun
[15:41:26] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: LGBT ostracizes all the time
[15:41:33] <KatrinValerie> All stats show that jail sucks, obviously that's an argument against current jail policies or the concept of punishment all together.
[15:41:34] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: hence why they are just known as "LGBT" now
[15:41:38] <KatrinValerie> Meow
[15:41:46] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Uhhhh. Chrischan is part of /lgbt/
[15:41:57] <DunceCotus> ?
[15:42:30] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Youve never heard of chrischan?
[15:42:37] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: no
[15:42:40] <Kill-Animals> The inventer of Sonichu?
[15:42:50] <Kill-Animals> A cross between pikachu and sonic the hedgehog
[15:42:57] <DunceCotus> Okay?
[15:43:05] <KatrinValerie> It's better to not have heard about them
[15:43:09] <Kill-Animals> ^
[15:43:16] <DunceCotus> not sure the relevance
[15:43:17] <Kill-Animals> I don't even want to begin to describe him
[15:44:00] <Kill-Animals> he is severely mentally ill. He ended up becoming a woman. He recently went to jail for doing bedroom things to his senile mother.
[15:44:13] <KatrinValerie> It's a massively tragic story
[15:44:37] <KatrinValerie> You should note that an online mob toyed with them
[15:44:43] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: how does this justify ostracization?
[15:44:57] <Kill-Animals> tragic? yeah... i mean, how could it not be, but... 
[15:45:29] <KatrinValerie> And the worst part is that their livlihood depended on these online activities
[15:45:36] <DunceCotus> well I can't speak for Chrischan's relationship with his mother
[15:45:52] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Well for starters, I don't want chrischan forcing bedroom things on anybody that I know who is currently suffering from dementia.
[15:46:29] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: well again not sure the relevance
[15:46:30] <KatrinValerie> tbh I find it really weird when people obsess about specific other people like that
[15:46:30] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: I didnt realize chrischan made money from what he did. 
[15:46:43] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: kept the whole family afloat
[15:46:46] <DunceCotus> ostracization doesn't stop people from doing bad things
[15:46:50] <KatrinValerie> They'd be homeless otherwise
[15:46:51] <DunceCotus> in fact it likely contributes to it
[15:47:01] <Kill-Animals> what? I didnt know that. 
[15:47:14] <KatrinValerie> Yeah cause you are not really looking into things
[15:47:28] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: No thats incorrect, because a person's personality is a negotiation between himself and those around him.
[15:47:38] <KatrinValerie> And they are probably really trans
[15:47:43] <DunceCotus> negotiation? Lol
[15:47:54] <Kill-Animals> yes.
[15:48:13] <DunceCotus> a person's personality is a production of a given socius
[15:48:55] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Even here. I can't simply say anything in this channel and not expect to be banned. I have to acclimate myself to the wishes of this community, and offer value in return.
[15:49:00] <KatrinValerie> It's a worrying social trend, people living off of being a target for harrasment online
[15:49:15] <Kill-Animals> I hope I offer people value here, but if I don't, then I try to work on myself and hope for the best.
[15:49:51] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Anything online seems to be a worrying social trend these days. 
[15:50:10] <Kill-Animals> Over Socialization.
[15:50:20] <DunceCotus> riiiiiiii-iiiiiiiii-iiiiiiii-iiii-iii-iii-ii-i-ight
[15:50:23] <KatrinValerie> True, on one hand it's nice to be able to connect to people all over the world.
[15:50:44] <KatrinValerie> But then you also have over exposure and it can be tough to see which relationship really matters.
[15:51:18] <KatrinValerie> The most important relationships are probably those to people around you. It sucks when your neighbhour hates you.
[15:51:56] <Sapphirus> Internet is a very valuable place to socialise with people that you otherwise would never encounter in person.
[15:51:58] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Yep. Its been maybe two decades since I last got to know my neighbors.
[15:52:22] <KatrinValerie> You need a real life social net
[15:52:35] <DunceCotus> real life is increasingly hostile
[15:52:36] <Sapphirus> As an introverted person, I would keep to myself regardless. I'm not very good at approaching other people and the internet has struck down that barrier.
[15:52:45] <KatrinValerie> whether you are a loner or not, when shit hits the fan you want to be able to fall back on relationships
[15:52:49] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: That is so true, especially regarding yours truly
[15:53:22] <DunceCotus> one should not have to rely on relationships
[15:53:23] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Yeah it is increasingly hostile, especially for men, and not in the warrior sense, but in the immasculating sense.
[15:53:25] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: it's hard these days, especially in cities where everyone is living in a pretty anonmyous situation and it's normal for people to move a lot
[15:53:45] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: immasculating? No
[15:53:47] <KatrinValerie> A lot of this has to do with a lack of community
[15:53:59] <KatrinValerie> There aren't any places for exchange to happen
[15:54:03] <KatrinValerie> Often
[15:54:22] <KatrinValerie> Here we have some and we at least talk to our neighbhours once in a while.
[15:54:24] <Sapphirus> Seems to be the internet is where that happens nowadays.
[15:54:26] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: mmmmm are you a masculine sort of man?
[15:54:34] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: privatization of public spaces
[15:54:45] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: no, and I don't care about that
[15:55:01] <KatrinValerie> Men who worry about their masculinity are weird
[15:55:02] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Church was good for that.
[15:55:12] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Then you wouldnt get or notice it.
[15:55:25] <DunceCotus> masculinity is not a fixed concept
[15:55:28] <KatrinValerie> Are you afraid your dick will fall off somehow if you touch lipstick?
[15:55:48] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: yes? How did you know?
[15:55:52] <DunceCotus> its a worry of identarians
[15:56:03] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: it's a common fear of insecure males
[15:56:09] <KatrinValerie> The phenomenom is well studied
[15:56:15] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Nice shit test. 
[15:56:33] <DunceCotus> I am not sure its about insecurity
[15:56:39] <DunceCotus> its more about identity
[15:56:59] <DunceCotus> identifying with one's gender (Whatever that means), then comparing that with historical formations of that identity
[15:57:09] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: To give a serious answer to that though, part of the essense of masculinity is the ability to tell the truth. Telling the truth today however will get one fired from their jobs or even imprisoned.
[15:57:38] <DunceCotus> lol wat
[15:58:19] <Sapphirus> I don't know if I'd attach that moral attribute to masculinity.
[15:58:34] <Kill-Animals> I got reprimanded at a volunteer job because I made a self deprecating joke, that "Digging holes is a mans job" -- My female boss said that this was demeaning to some other girl I was working with who apparently had a mental illness
[15:58:35] <Sapphirus> You seem to be confused about morality vs. identity.
[15:58:54] <Kill-Animals> Eventually got fired.
[15:59:06] <Sapphirus> Sure, there might be some moral attributes associated with masculinity, but I'm not sure that's one of them.
[16:00:15] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: It is one because a woman just naturally faces greater danger than a man if she is honest, because not all truths are comforting or enjoyable to hear. 
[16:00:49] <DunceCotus> whats an uncomfortable truth?
[16:01:16] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: mmmm whats a good example...
[16:01:16] <Zoidberg> Truth without cocoa and blanket
[16:01:26] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: sounds like they may have fired you for denigrating a fellow co-worker?
[16:01:36] <amigojapan> You don't have to say everything just because it happens to be true
[16:01:46] <Sapphirus> ^^
[16:01:54] <amigojapan> Wb Zoidberg 
[16:01:58] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: don't we?
[16:02:01] <Sapphirus> Knowing when to speak is a valuable skill.
[16:02:15] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Broadly, an uncomfortable truth might be that a system is corrupt and needs reform, but to state as much means that you are accusing all those who are part of the system as being inept in someway and asking them to change which is difficult in itself.
[16:02:16] <Sapphirus> You just don't blurt out everything you think.
[16:02:17] <Zoidberg> Thanks amigojapan
[16:02:17] <amigojapan> Nope DunceCotus 
[16:02:22] <DunceCotus> I don't think people can avoid speaking the truth
[16:03:07] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: perhaps its uncomfortable cause it isn't the truth
[16:03:12] <Sapphirus> Oh, sure, there's a lot of people who can can avoid speaking the truth.
[16:03:15] <DunceCotus> its a rough estimation
[16:03:23] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: If you are a christian, thats not part of the ethos. For other religions, that will vary morally. Judaism for example does not hold truth as the highest moral virtue, but instead it holds life as that.
[16:03:44] <DunceCotus> Sapphirus: even if you avoid speaking the truth, the truth comes through
[16:04:18] <Sapphirus> For sure, but it depends how far one has buried themselves in their own lies.
[16:04:26] <Sapphirus> Most proficient liars believe their own bullshit.
[16:04:29] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: extolling truth is probably something that came from the ancient Greeks
[16:04:47] <Sapphirus> And usually those lies are built on mountains worth of insecurities 
[16:05:03] <Zoidberg> Amigojapan, teenagers, let them be.
[16:05:07] <Kill-Animals> "You just don't blurt out everything you think." -- See; this is immasculating. I agree that this sentiment rules society today and forms much of our institutions that we value, but none the less.
[16:05:16] <DunceCotus> even when I lie, I speak the truth - Jacques Lacan
[16:05:33] <DunceCotus> cause why do we lie?
[16:05:59] <Sapphirus> Every lie owes a debt to the truth.
[16:06:04] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: sometimes to avoid other people from getting angry
[16:06:05] <DunceCotus> its not to conceal the truth so much as to convey a truth that we can't socially acknowledge
[16:06:08] <Sapphirus> Eventually that debt will have to be repaid.
[16:06:15] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Well the greeks played a part in it of course. Socrates being the chief example. In christianity though, Jesus Christ says that he is the truth, and that "the truth shall set you free."
[16:06:20] <Zoidberg> You people are wasting good weekend.
[16:06:37] <Zoidberg> Later amigojapan
[16:06:48] <DunceCotus> imagine believing in waste
[16:06:50] <amigojapan> Later Zoidberg 
[16:07:10] <Kill-Animals> Zoidberg: Later bro. have a good one.
[16:07:28] <DunceCotus> we lie to tell the truth that cannot be told
[16:07:36] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I believe Jesus was influenced by Greek philosophers 
[16:07:46] <Sapphirus> That's far from the only reason people lie. People can bury themselves in lies.
[16:08:03] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Nah that sounds like bluff. I don't think you can extend Jacques Lacan to a workable world view. 
[16:08:20] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: I think we can draw from whomever/whatever
[16:08:45] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: I believe that what you just said, is a subversive truism.
[16:09:00] <lastonestanding> any truth seekers?
[16:09:11] <DunceCotus> Sapphirus: people buried in lies is the truth of a social predicament
[16:10:12] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Its bluff though. Its like playing poker and saying, "I believe that we can pretend to have any hand" -- yes while that is true, you can not actually play the cards out as if you have any hand you wish.
[16:10:21] <DunceCotus> like they are telling the truth in their lies by way of what necessitates the lying
[16:10:25] <Sapphirus> I'm not sure you understand even what Jacques Lacan was even alluding to.
[16:10:48] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: I never said you could
[16:10:52] <Kill-Animals> lastonestanding: always a truth seeker.
[16:11:00] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: that only proves my point.. you can't truly lie
[16:11:26] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: No its bluff. 
[16:11:32] <DunceCotus> if you are 'lying' it is the truth that can only become apparent in its concealment
[16:12:19] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: If you were a judge in a court, and a witness lied to you, you wouldnt treat him the same way as a witness who was being honest with you.
[16:12:54] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: sure
[16:13:02] <Sapphirus> Really depends how far buried that truth is underneath the lie in question.
[16:13:03] <DunceCotus> but the lying witness is still telling the truth
[16:13:08] <DunceCotus> why would they lie? 
[16:13:16] <DunceCotus> The truth is here in the necessity to lie
[16:13:19] <Sapphirus> Not every lie is equal.
[16:13:35] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Well I mean someone who is intenionally obfuscating, not subconsiously lying.
[16:14:03] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, this is applicable to both scenarios.
[16:14:17] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: A person lies as a rational attempt to achieve an end sought. 
[16:14:32] <DunceCotus> like oil companies lying about the environmental destruction they're causing.. the truth shines through their lies. They need to lie in order to keep their business going, to keep the megaprofits rolling in
[16:14:50] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: or to avoid strife 
[16:15:18] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Avoiding strife is an end sought.
[16:15:19] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I think most of the time it is to avoid strife
[16:15:28] <Kill-Animals> probably
[16:15:30] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: yes an end sought.. but the truth is in why this end is sought
[16:15:56] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: oil companies dont cause environmental destruction. If anything its the opposite.

[16:16:07] <DunceCotus> environmental destruction causes oil companies?
[16:16:34] <Sapphirus> Duncecotus, I think you are just oversimplifying this. It's not as obvious as you make it out to be unless you have the necessary information in order to make that deduction.
[16:16:36] <lastonestanding> does a tornado cause environmental destruction?
[16:16:41] <Sapphirus> Lies onto themselves do not reveal the truth they are concealing.
[16:16:54] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Yes, in a roundabout way, but more so, that oil companies have helped save the environment.
[16:16:55] <DunceCotus> Sapphirus: I think they do
[16:17:09] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: AHAHAHAH
[16:17:15] <Sapphirus> I wish I were that naive.
[16:17:25] <Kill-Animals> lastonestanding: Yeah I would say so.
[16:18:11] <Sapphirus> And that comment probably applies to what you both just said.
[16:19:22] <DunceCotus> Sapphirus: if there's no way of verifying if someone is lying, that's the truth of a hole in our knowledge
[16:19:41] <DunceCotus> and the person lying is still telling the truth -- that is the truth of this hole
[16:19:43] <Sapphirus> Yes, and that's what I just said.
[16:19:54] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Well maybe if you are curious, because you are a smart lad. Probably way smarter than me, im kind of a nincompoop. But maybe check out the works of Walter Block and Environmentalism. He puts forward the case that capitalism with its oil companies and all are the best thing for an environment.
[16:20:12] <Sapphirus> You yourself don't even believe that a lie onto itself reveals itself.
[16:20:28] <Sapphirus> And if you claim to, that's just cognitive dissonance on display.
[16:20:34] <Sapphirus> Because otherwise, I don't know how you could come to that conclusion.
[16:20:43] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: so that's why we are rapidly approaching irreversible environmental crises?

[16:21:20] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: capitalism
[16:21:32] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Most environmental crisis's have been caused by the government. The soviet Union made like a third of its land uninhabitable
[16:21:59] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: cause they had to compete with western capitalist countries to survive
[16:22:04] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: its all capitalism mate
[16:22:24] <DunceCotus> and yeah a lot of it is in error, not malice
[16:22:28] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: No you have to do more research. The cleanest countries and most environmentally protected are those with the most economic freedom. The greatest environmental catastrophes exist in socialist countries.
[16:22:38] <DunceCotus> but its because of the main tenants of capitalism -- competitivity, growth, accumulation
[16:23:03] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, even though, I think what he's spouting is shallow, what you said there is quite obtuse.
[16:23:11] <Kill-Animals> oh wow. What a hot take DunceCotus. Where did you learn that? College?
[16:23:15] <Sapphirus> What the west actually does is outsource all of that pollution to poorer countries.
[16:23:36] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: they were also countries that had just emerged from feudal regimes, and in geography that is prone to ecological collapse
[16:23:47] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: its not all capitalism but it doesn't help the situation 
[16:23:52] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: The soviet Union wasn't outsourced. There was a trade embargo.
[16:24:09] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, what about the People's Republic of China?
[16:24:28] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Yes it does. A clean environment requires excess capital to afford.

[16:24:58] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: They are a communist regime.
[16:24:59] <Sapphirus> Environmental disasters, of which there are numerous ongoing there, are a result of the so-called cleanest countries outsourcing to China.
[16:25:12] <DunceCotus> its capitalism creating a problem and then half-arsedly trying to address it
[16:25:40] <Sapphirus> Greedy corporate interests outsourcing to a country with little-to-no environmental regulation.
[16:25:41] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: We also outsource to switzerland and Canada.
[16:26:12] <DunceCotus> it makes sense that religious people would be pro-capitalism
[16:26:17] <Sapphirus> We're just leaving the pollution on someone else's doorstep and standing up like we're all high and mighty.

[16:27:04] <Urchin[emacs]> Kill-Animals: you're very much not outsourcing highly poluting stuff to Switzerland
[16:27:14] <Sapphirus> That isn't even what I'm talking about, Kill-Animals.
[16:27:34] <Sapphirus> There's a difference between that and outsourcing very dirty industry.
[16:27:49] <Kill-Animals> Urchin[emacs]: Sure you are. Complex heavy metal toxins are going to be in many of the products produced and exported from switzerland.
[16:27:49] <DunceCotus> the situation is not a matter of unequal distribution of wealth
[16:28:02] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: why do you think so. Does making shirts pay better?
[16:28:28] <Sapphirus> Everything you take for granted would be far more expensive if China had the same level of stringent environmental regulations as we do here.
[16:28:31] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Its more stable and less backbreaking than farm work.

[16:32:52] <Kill-Animals> Oh state capitalism --

[16:35:27] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Its socialist. Thats good enough
[16:36:06] <Urchin[emacs]> Sapphirus: North Korea abandoned communism (IIRC) a Kim ago, now they're officially a militaristic dictatorship
[16:36:11] <Sapphirus> And even then, most communists would probably argue over whether or not it's even communist. Tried and true excuse that communism has never been done.
[16:36:12] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: capitalism is about an economic way of handling things 
[16:36:27] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: State capitalism is an oxymoron. And North Korea is more like NAtional Socialism rather than international anar- ah whatever you guys dont care lmao
[16:36:46] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: No, capitalism is about economic freedom.
[16:36:55] <Urchin[emacs]> Kill-Animals: if state is the only one doing investment in new enterprise, you have state capitalism
[16:37:24] <amigojapan> That's just brainwashing propaganda Kill-Animals 
[16:37:43] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Merchantalism would also fit the definition of "An economic way of handling things" and so would orthodox socialism for that matter. However their means to achieving that vary.
[16:37:52] <Sapphirus> Urchin[emacs], I'd agree with that assessment. 
[16:38:03] <Kill-Animals> Urchin[emacs]: That is Socialism or coorpratism.

[16:39:19] <amigojapan> Lol Kill-Animals 
[16:39:45] <Kill-Animals> thanks for reminding me of the word. I forgot what they were called, "Kibutz"
[16:40:12] <Sapphirus> Communists themselves allude to this when you point at every fascist dictatorship and they say "Well, that wasn't real communism."
[16:41:30] <DunceCotus> fascism != communism
[16:41:32] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, I don't think communism could every truly scale beyond like a small village of people.
[16:41:41] <Kill-Animals> well Fascism is a form of socialism. Technically, "National Socialism". ( Not to be confused with Nazism, which stands for National Socialism, but is actually Racial Socialism )
[16:41:43] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: well kibutz are communities, not countries 
[16:41:45] <Sapphirus> DunceCotus, I'm talking about the result of a revolution.
[16:42:04] <Sapphirus> Most communist revolutions end up installing what inevitably manifest into textbook fascist dictatorships.
[16:42:13] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: why not fill the land with many kibutz?
[16:42:50] <Sapphirus> I think with the way we've organised ourselves as a species, it's not something that could work without splitting back into tribes.
[16:42:51] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Again; they established Socialism. Fascism is "National Socialism".

[16:44:13] <Sapphirus> Duncecotus, and not a single one has gone right.
[16:44:15] <DunceCotus> Sapphirus: but the point is revolution only happens cause people have no alternative
[16:44:22] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Yeah I would say they are a form of national, or rather an imperial form of socialism.
[16:44:27] <amigojapan> Sapphirus:  kibutz are not tribes, they are more like small towns with shared property. Like anyone can use a kibutz car from the kibutz
[16:44:29] <DunceCotus> Sapphirus: people do not 'decide' to have revolution
[16:44:34] <Kill-Animals> China is an empire; they span many different races.

[17:21:36] <bxgelsan> to say something anti bi :p
[17:21:38] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: its true though. Men arent supposed to have emotions.
[17:21:39] <bxgelsan> but im not
[17:21:43] <bxgelsan> shit head in me :)
[17:21:49] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: can I even be not gay?
[17:21:58] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, I feel sorry for you if you think that.
[17:22:00] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: no?
[17:22:09] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Why's that?
[17:22:24] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: no, that is a toxic trope. men usually have feelings. if they don't, something is off.
[17:22:25] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: I thought you were a girl
[17:22:35] <Sapphirus> It indicates a lack of emotional maturity.
[17:22:39] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus: you are human. there. enjoy life.
[17:22:58] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: well, I mean from an external perspective, no matter who I sleep with it will be gay to some observers
[17:23:04] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Its not a trope at all. There are almost no people alive today who would accept what I say. The trope is the opposite, that men should be emotional like women.
[17:23:10] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: I have slept with people.. its crap
[17:23:14] <DunceCotus> people snore and shit
[17:23:26] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus: yep. i snore. ex hated it.
[17:23:31] <bxgelsan> its bad :x
[17:23:31] <KatrinValerie> Being emotional and having emotions are two things.
[17:23:41] <bxgelsan> that and screaming in sleep sometimes 
[17:23:46] <bxgelsan> lol
[17:23:53] <bxgelsan> talking etc
[17:23:57] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Also, you are a woman, so you just simply have no idea what it would be like to be a man devoid of emotions, and how that manifests itself.
[17:24:10] <bxgelsan> ///
[17:24:10] <KatrinValerie> Being emotional usually refers to letting your emotions control your actions and that's generally a bad strategy in life whether you are male/female or somewhere inbetween
[17:24:26] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals: you dont know Kill-Animals as far as I know.

[17:24:45] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: wait what?
[17:25:11] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: all serious research shows that men are just as emotional as women, the differences in expression are mostly cultural.

[18:19:42] <amigojapan> That's ok dudebros 
[18:19:42] <milkshake1> what
[18:20:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> VPNs are only good to prevent easy network tracking/analysis by small corpos. And using those same corpos' services basically guarantees you destroy any improvement in privacy it provided.
[18:20:10] <dudebros> amigojapan: are you a mod
[18:20:13] <milkshake1> vpn is ok and necessary in my case. i need dazn canada to watch soccer stream
[18:20:26] <Zoidberg> dudebros: you don't get banned like that. If it's more than four lines in short period, text spam, you'll get silenced. Bans are when you behave like benis.

[18:22:12] <milkshake1> still its VPN :D
[18:22:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> milkshake1: -_-
[18:22:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The thing is those ads should call them "VPN-based obfuscating proxies"
[18:23:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Which is what they really are.
[18:23:33] <Sapphirus> You just have to pick a server that is going over the good non-congested route.
[18:23:47] <Zoidberg> Aurora_v_kosmose: you don't joke around security
[18:23:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Zoidberg: Indeed.

[18:49:54] <Sadale> It isn't atom. But it's power efficient with 10W TDP for the CPU.
[18:50:05] <Sadale> And it's far far more powerful than a raspberry pi
[18:50:56] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: ok. But I am not really into romance stuff
[18:52:19] <Sadale> Zoidberg, anyway let's see if the actual problem is on my new router. If I found that my new router actually has no problem, there isn't much reason for me to switch to another router.
[18:52:26] <Sadale> It could very well be a problem of my ISP

[19:30:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That has more to do with radio that wifi.
[19:31:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There are proper fancy antenna cards & outputs you can use.

Likewise you can't run your own Discord server (yes they call their channels
[19:54:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> servers, no they aren't servers, that's just bull).
[19:56:27] <emmeka> right like there's nothing in the IRC protocol itself that would make anything "remember" what channels/servers you were connected to. You do that with your client. And your client can implement this however it wants.
[19:57:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah, I intend to lead into comparison with Matrix where the protocol does state that servers can offer such funtionality as channel join history.

[20:35:46] <emmeka> in ye olde days this was a shorthand for asking someone their irl details online
[20:36:04] <KatrinValerie> bxgelsan: we eventually just got DSL
[20:36:15] <Matt|home> you know the reason i reflexively hate other protocols/services like discord/slack/etc .. because at my old company we spent a significant useless chunk of our time deciding what to use for our meetings
[20:36:23] <Matt|home> i just got fed up with it
[20:36:27] <dudebro> age : any , sex : anything goes unless its sus , location : nearby is preferred
[20:36:34] <dudebro> done
[20:36:45] <bxgelsan> ...this isnt a dating site
[20:36:54] <dudebro> uh
[20:36:55] <KatrinValerie> Matt|home: Oh good grief, we spread our communication across way too many platforms in the "startup" I worked with for a while
[20:37:12] <KatrinValerie> prefounding, no contracts no nothing
[20:37:13] <Matt|home> but now everybody's using discord.. and despite my absolute _best_ efforts at being a cranky old codger, i finally capitulated and now i have 3 discord servers im connected to
[20:37:21] <Matt|home> yeah same
[20:37:21] <KatrinValerie> it was stupid to even get caught up in that
[20:37:28] <emmeka> you've been contaminated
[20:37:41] <Matt|home> i understand the desire to want to use something like slack, i still use it for business - but this should have been a fucking one and done conversation
[20:37:48] <KatrinValerie> Matt|home: Slack, Asana are just the first two I can recall
[20:37:49] <Matt|home> not a "we're going to include this in the next 5 meetings as part of the minutes"
[20:37:54] <Matt|home> discussion
[20:38:04] <KatrinValerie> It was all a miserable failure
[20:38:10] <KatrinValerie> and nobody reads documentation
[20:38:12] <KatrinValerie> q.q
[20:38:16] <Matt|home> i do :p
[20:38:31] <KatrinValerie> Matt|home: but you are not in any of my software projects
[20:38:39] <KatrinValerie> I don't have any active projects anymore though
[20:39:05] <Matt|home> anyhoo - dudebro , FYI fun fact: so the server you're on right now is libera, sort of branched off from the previous freenode server. freenode was one of the oldest major irc servers.. and i used to work for the lunatic who now owns it :D
[20:39:06] <KatrinValerie> I want to get back into coding, but throwing together a full game engine is probably overkill isn't it?
[20:39:32] <Matt|home> yeah that's a project in and of itself right there
[20:39:42] <dudebro> Freenode 
[20:39:56] <KatrinValerie> Matt|home: there just are things that I want to do, which are likely hard with existing engines
[20:40:02] <Matt|home> they used to be all about FOSS, but essentially got bought out by a rich south korean insane man
[20:40:12] <Matt|home> little bastard had me laid off 
[20:40:21] <KatrinValerie> I want support for defining different geometries for different maps
[20:40:29] <Zoidberg> I joined discord back when hi117 and some others made an anime group there years ago.
[20:40:30] <Matt|home> i mean go for it, it's just gonna be dedicated as fuck
[20:40:33] <KatrinValerie> and different physics 
[20:40:40] <Zoidberg> but didn't keep up
[20:40:47] <Matt|home> valve made a pretty decent physics engine for a while
[20:40:53] <Zoidberg> discord was consuming too much ram back then
[20:40:58] <dudebro> wtf happened to freenode
[20:41:03] <KatrinValerie> Matt|home: I probably won't be able to go back to uni for a while, so why not spend my time on that instead of doom scrolling twitter.
[20:41:16] <Matt|home> dudebro : it still exists. it just got bought out by a rich lunatic who tried turning it into a for profit service
[20:41:53] <Matt|home> KatrinValerie : if you wanna work with me at any point let me know what your skillset is, only issue is i can't pay you :p but i can guarantee half of any profits made
[20:41:54] <Matt|home> brb
[20:42:40] <hi117> hi
[20:42:51] <dudebro> hi117 hi117 
[20:43:08] <KatrinValerie> Matt|home: I know a bunch of programming languages, a lil bit of math, idk what you need to hear
[20:43:26] <bxgelsan> dudebro: people or someone shennaniganed
[20:43:27] <emmeka> dudebro a big part of IRC you're going to have to get used to is that networks (*not* like Discord servers, but actual irl server networks that host channels) are *entirely* different from one another, run by different people for different purposes, with different rules and different cultures
[20:43:27] <KatrinValerie> I used to write crappy cheats for online games, doubt that skill is useful for anything
[20:44:04] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: there are weird places for sure
[20:44:05] <dudebro> emmeka: yeaa I've been on mastodon social , kinda get how this works
[20:44:05] <bxgelsan> irc has lots of in group and out group fighting. over lots of shit. within staff down to users.
[20:44:21] <KatrinValerie> I think I was on quakenet and rizon before I was on freenode at all
[20:44:47] <emmeka> dudebro this network, libera, was a split from Freenode when some absolutely batshit insane guy more or less did a hostile takeover of the freenode network. Most people left freenode and came here. Freenode was originally a network for free software projects and open source shit, and libera continues that.
[20:44:54] <emmeka> but we also have general interest channels like this one
[20:45:04] <dudebro> nice
[20:45:16] <emmeka> dudebro on Libera, you'll find that channels of general interest use ##, while official channels for registered FOSS projects use #
