[04:34:11] <SlimmyJimmy> Is this a valid regular expression: "*Hello World*"
[04:34:29] <SlimmyJimmy> I don't see the problem but the PowerShell is complaing about a quantifier matching nothing.
[04:34:50] <mysticspiral[m]> it's not valid
[04:34:55] <SlimmyJimmy> how so?
[04:35:03] <mysticspiral[m]> you need to escape the *
[04:35:08] <mysticspiral[m]> to make it literal
[04:35:22] <SlimmyJimmy> But I don't want to find a "literal" asterisk.
[04:35:27] <SlimmyJimmy> I want the wildcards
[04:35:51] <SlimmyJimmy> So that it finds anyting that "contains" the words "Hello World".
[04:35:55] <mysticspiral[m]> then write .*Hello World.*
[04:36:02] <SlimmyJimmy> Anything preceding it and anything after it.
[04:36:16] <SlimmyJimmy> Hmmm
[04:36:27] <SlimmyJimmy> That's bizarre.
[04:36:28] <mysticspiral[m]> writing Hello World should be enough for that
[04:36:36] <mysticspiral[m]> it's not
[04:38:16] <SlimmyJimmy> I thought asterisk meant zero or more matches?
[04:38:21] <SlimmyJimmy> of anything.
[04:38:41] <mysticspiral[m]> * quantifies the previous entity 0 or more times. so d* will match d 0 or more times
[04:38:44] <mysticspiral[m]> sorry markdown
[04:38:58] <mysticspiral[m]> * quantifies the previous entity 0 or more times. so d* will match d 0 or more times
[04:39:26] <mysticspiral[m]> dot matches any character
[04:39:41] <mysticspiral[m]> .* matches any character 0 or more times
[04:39:42] <SlimmyJimmy> Oh, so the asterisk has to match the preceding character/characters zero or more times and if there are no preceding characters it doesn't know what to do I guess.
[04:40:00] <mysticspiral[m]> thats right
[04:40:06] <SlimmyJimmy> Okay, thank you.
[04:41:07] <mysticspiral[m]> the asterisk will only work on a single character or regex object
[04:41:22] <SlimmyJimmy> The dot doesn't necessarily mean a single character, it means any character.
[04:41:48] <mysticspiral[m]> without quantifier it's a single character
[04:41:52] <SlimmyJimmy> Yep, I just tried ".*Hello World.*" and got the same results.
[04:42:09] <mysticspiral[m]> try "Hello World"
[04:42:15] <SlimmyJimmy> Okay, very good, thank you. I gotta remember this sublties.
[04:42:25] <SlimmyJimmy> little tiny subtlities. :)
[04:42:51] <SlimmyJimmy> Yep, those are both the same it seems.
[04:42:58] <SlimmyJimmy> Just like you said.

[08:25:51] <mysticspiral[m]> wasnt that your first link, except with minimum 8?
[08:26:16] <re101-mouse-69> first one was only with numbers
[08:26:24] <re101-mouse-69> no characters
[08:26:47] <mysticspiral[m]> i mean the link you posted
[08:26:49] <mysticspiral[m]> https://regex101.com/r/KVgkFn/1
[08:27:09] <re101-mouse-69> oh no the link i posted was garbage link
[08:27:21] <re101-mouse-69> i needed to test my regex on that
[08:28:01] <re101-mouse-69> sorry the first link is weird

[08:28:24] <mysticspiral[m]> it almost does what you want
[08:28:33] <mysticspiral[m]> you just need to change the 8 to 12
[08:28:40] <re101-mouse-69> really ?

[08:47:53] <re101-mouse-69> can someone help me with this

[08:48:25] <re101-mouse-69> in java regex
[08:49:55] <mysticspiral[m]> hilarious
[08:50:15] <re101-mouse-69> please brother
[08:51:14] <mysticspiral[m]> as i said, just replace the 8 with 12
[08:55:55] <re101-mouse-69> it does not work for certain test strings
[08:56:05] <re101-mouse-69> 123456abcdef!!
[08:56:18] <re101-mouse-69> for example ^
[08:56:30] <mysticspiral[m]> it doesnt contain any uppercase letter
[08:56:39] <mysticspiral[m]> so of course it will fail
[08:56:55] <re101-mouse-69> it should be as upper case or lower case
[08:57:13] <mysticspiral[m]> are you actually trying password validation?
[08:57:35] <re101-mouse-69> not complete validation
[08:57:55] <re101-mouse-69> nope
[08:59:11] <mysticspiral[m]> so its just about matching anything longer than 11 and ascii only?
[08:59:56] <re101-mouse-69> basically yeah
[09:00:18] <re101-mouse-69> minimum 12 characters a-z A-Z and special characters
[09:00:18] <mysticspiral[m]> [ -~]{12,}
[09:00:27] <mysticspiral[m]> and numbers
[09:00:34] <re101-mouse-69> and numbers sorry
[09:01:00] <mysticspiral[m]> simple as that: [ -~]{12,}
[09:01:29] <re101-mouse-69> wow
[09:01:36] <re101-mouse-69> i didnt know it was that simple
[09:01:38] <re101-mouse-69> thank you
[09:01:40] <re101-mouse-69> once again
[09:01:51] <re101-mouse-69> can i ask what the , after 12 means
[09:02:16] <mysticspiral[m]> [ -~] is a character class that matches everything between space and tilde
[09:02:17] <mysticspiral[m]> 12 or more
[09:02:30] <mysticspiral[m]> {12,24} would mean 12 to 23
[09:02:36] <mysticspiral[m]> srry 24
[09:03:03] <re101-mouse-69> what if i wanted only printable special characters and no space ?
[09:03:29] <re101-mouse-69> would that be [-~] only ?
[09:03:31] <mysticspiral[m]> space is kinda printable
[09:03:57] <re101-mouse-69> youre right
[09:04:01] <mysticspiral[m]> just look at an ascii table
[09:04:28] <re101-mouse-69> gotcha
[09:04:43] <mysticspiral[m]> so it would be [!-~]{12,}
[09:04:43] <mysticspiral[m]> after space comes !
[09:05:20] <re101-mouse-69> thank you for taking time to teach me
[09:05:41] <re101-mouse-69> how do i count for brackets in between numbers ?

[09:06:16] <re101-mouse-69> for example ^
[09:09:24] <mysticspiral[m]> should (123)456-789 also match or only (123) 456-789?
[09:10:33] <mysticspiral[m]> and what about 123 456789?
[09:11:19] <re101-mouse-69> both (123)456-789 and (123) 456-789

[09:30:03] <re101-mouse-69> it should be allowed
[09:30:23] <re101-mouse-69> the space should be after the bracket

[09:51:27] <re101-mouse-69> wow
[09:51:33] <re101-mouse-69> what about the email one ?
[09:51:43] <re101-mouse-69> like a default one
[09:51:53] <mysticspiral[m]> it's a rabbit hole
[09:52:03] <re101-mouse-69> numbers a-z A-Z @gmail.com
[09:52:14] <re101-mouse-69> its a rabbit hole ?
[09:52:15] <mysticspiral[m]> what about dashes?
[09:52:43] <mysticspiral[m]> you might run into unexpected problems
[09:53:04] <re101-mouse-69> no dashes
[09:53:05] <mysticspiral[m]> !email
[09:53:05] <perlbot> http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html, https://emailregex.com/, https://regex101.com/library?orderBy=MOST_POINTS&search=email
[09:53:30] <mysticspiral[m]> but email addresses can contain dashes
[09:54:41] <re101-mouse-69> for the specific one can we do it without dashes or special characters except for the @sign
[09:56:01] <mysticspiral[m]> but its not about disallowing right?
[09:56:16] <re101-mouse-69> nope
[09:56:17] <mysticspiral[m]> you could just use the regex from the first article
[09:56:21] <mysticspiral[m]> \b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}\b
[09:56:49] <re101-mouse-69> it does not catch this though
[09:56:50] <re101-mouse-69> testuser@testdomain.com
[09:58:38] <mysticspiral[m]> turn on the case insensitive flag
[09:59:13] <re101-mouse-69> how do i do that
[09:59:23] <mysticspiral[m]> and since you are using it for validation and not to search for email addresses in a text use this:
[09:59:24] <mysticspiral[m]> ^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}$

[17:38:46] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/fyYEFD/2
[17:39:55] <zen_coder> this works
[17:40:05] <zen_coder> what does `?:` does here in the () ?
[17:41:32] <digitok> it just prevents the contents from being "captured"
[17:41:59] <digitok> if you remove ?: you will notice "group 1" is returned (check match information on the right side of regex101)
[17:44:25] *** Joins: palasso (~palasso@user/palasso)
[17:44:45] <zen_coder> so without ?: it matches also the end "/" path separator
[17:46:13] <digitok> with ?:, it matches and returns "foo/"
[17:46:32] <digitok> without ?:, it matches "foo/" and returns "foo/" (group 0 / full match) and "foo" (group 1)

But it seems to be a lot of steps (819 on /5, 4 677 on /6) maybe there's something I'm not noticing. I'll separate the logic in 3 different statements and see how it does.
