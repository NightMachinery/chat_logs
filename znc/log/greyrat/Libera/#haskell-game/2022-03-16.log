[06:54:27] <kadenwolff[m]> Anyone have any particular thoughts on FRP libraries? I'm leaning towards using Yampa but am also considering Netwire

[12:45:32] <f-a> kadenwolff[m]: yampa is the battle tested one, netwire I feel more elegant
[12:45:55] <f-a> I never liked arrow syntax or monadloop or similar myself

[15:37:27] <icrbow[m]> <kadenwolff[m]> "Anyone have any particular..." <- The choice depends on your task as there are many different sorts of FRP and its implementations.
[16:59:25] <kadenwolff[m]> <f-a> "kadenwolff: yampa is the..." <- Gotcha, thanks!
[17:03:05] <kadenwolff[m]> <icrbow[m]> "The choice depends on your..." <- I hear that. I'm still somewhat new to FRP, so I'm trying to get a good idea of which library to stick with for a bit. I don't think I'd be properly able to evaluate the qualities of the different approaches yet.
[17:15:51] <icrbow[m]> Given that you're in gamedev channel, I'd recommend `reactive-banana` and `bearriver`. Those are actively maintained and should be fast. `reactive-banana` by the virtue of being push-based, `bearriver` (a modern rewrite of Yampa from the same author) based on a performant set of FRP primitives.
[18:03:59] <kadenwolff[m]> Oh cool, thank you :)
