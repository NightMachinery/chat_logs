[00:03:25] <headius> trying current rails install on 9.3 and getting an odd error
[00:03:35] * headius sent a code block: https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/a30649fc27c5deebe8f9b6afc23e0afeba5f4a64
[00:03:49] <headius> I'm going to clean this and rebuild and make sure I have a proper 9.3 HEAD
[00:07:03] <headius> might have been a glitch or dirty env... seems to work now
[00:07:10] <headius> I'm doing a full git clean to make sure
[00:13:43] <headius> it is working fine now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[00:13:51] <headius> weirdly slow to install a couple gems
[00:18:59] <enebo[m]> releasing on maven + gem
[00:19:28] <headius> install and generate worked with 9.3 HEAD and Rails 6.1.4.1
[00:20:03] <enebo[m]> Yeah I do test 6.1 as part of releasing so I expected it but I am not sure which particular point was last time
[00:20:17] <headius> ah ok... I wasn't sure what you are testing with
[00:20:31] <enebo[m]> I only do older on windows due to sassc
[00:21:03] <headius> I don't really want to try to test perf and we have a lot of outstanding perf items we want to do so I will not cover that much
[00:22:27] <headius> have you tried Rails 6.1+ on Windows lately?
[00:22:42] <headius> not sure if anything has changed to fix sassc but we need to deal with that at some point
[00:23:39] <headius> yeah scaffold, migrate, and CRUD all working fine for me
[00:23:42] <headius> woot
[00:23:46] <enebo[m]> I tried it for 9.3.1.0
[00:24:11] <enebo[m]> so you are saying it is working on windows?
[00:24:19] <headius> not on Windows
[00:24:26] <headius> this is just me testing locally on macOS
[00:24:35] <enebo[m]> ah ok
[00:24:51] <headius> sassc has had some tweaks for install on Windows but I don't think they helped us
[00:24:54] <enebo[m]> I no longer macos so I have not tried on there but usually it just works (M1 :( )
[00:25:21] <headius> I think the main thing is that it tries to build the library on Windows so it needs build tools
[00:25:27] <headius> where CRuby can just install the premade platform gem
[00:26:38] <enebo[m]> ok so on our updated website for 9.2.20 the topbar will still show 9.3 release and notes link
[00:26:38] <headius> enebo: I am in favor of spinning a 9.3.2 tomorrow or early next week so I can have recent fixes out there for RubyConf
[00:26:55] <enebo[m]> headius: I am open either way
[00:27:00] <enebo[m]> next week won't hurt us
[00:27:13] <headius> I speak on Tuesday
[00:27:23] <ahorek[m]> good evening!
[00:27:28] <headius> ahorek: hello!
[00:27:32] <enebo[m]> wait let's make sure I understand what you are thinking about
[00:28:02] <enebo[m]> you will want a release either way before your talk?  Or you will just say we are ready to release in a day or so sort of thing?
[00:28:12] <ahorek[m]> thanks @enebo for fixing that token issue :)
[00:28:37] <enebo[m]> ahorek: oh yeah no problem...the method was nearly already made in the lexer already
[00:28:49] <ahorek[m]> about sassc, there's a new alternative that works out of the box on jruby https://github.com/ntkme/sass-embedded-host-ruby
[00:29:00] <enebo[m]> headius: see my statement above about our web site
[00:29:02] <headius> oh really
[00:29:05] <enebo[m]> I need to get this out really soon
[00:29:14] <enebo[m]> it is already 4pm central
[00:29:22] <headius> enebo: I'm fine either way but it is always nice to have the latest downloadable
[00:29:31] <headius> I am not sure if there are any blockers for people trying 9.3.1
[00:29:48] <headius> 9.2.20 ship it if you are comfortable with it now
[00:29:48] <enebo[m]> headius: well monday may work for that BUT it depends on how smoothly it goes
[00:30:03] <ahorek[m]> but it's probably not worth integrating it to sprockets, rails is moving to a simpler assets management
[00:30:06] <headius> yeah not sure what else we have slated for 9.3.2 but there are a few good items in there already
[00:30:33] <headius> enebo[m]: seems fine to me.. 9.2 is in maintenance mode
[00:30:42] <enebo[m]> headius: I think from my perspective so long as I can test enough to know it is largely working then I can evaluate any late commits
[00:30:45] <enebo[m]> ok
[00:31:08] <enebo[m]> I am pushing site and then emails and github release
[00:31:13] <headius> ahorek[m]: well that is good news... this pipeline has gotten **thick**
[00:31:27] <headius> enebo: ok I will handle socials and dockers
[00:31:33] <enebo[m]> we will need social media/docket
[00:31:34] <enebo[m]> haha
[00:31:36] <enebo[m]> docket
[00:31:40] <enebo[m]> I want there to be a docket
[00:31:53] <headius> docket on the socials
[00:33:58] <headius> "JRuby 9.2.20 is released with several user-reported bugs fixed, FFI as a default gem (upgradable independent of JRuby) and a new jruby-openssl fixing a long-standing certificate verification issue. We recommend 9.2 users upgrade!"
[00:35:01] <headius> enebo: I just noticed an unmerged PR was still marked for 9.2.20 so might need to regen list or remove it
[00:35:53] <headius> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6780
[00:36:01] <headius> I think you did a different PR for that but it was never retargeted
[00:37:22] <enebo[m]> ok removing it
[00:37:45] <headius> https://twitter.com/jruby/status/1455642572261572616
[00:38:21] <headius> https://www.facebook.com/JRubyFans/posts/10165915449365578
[00:39:13] <enebo[m]> yeah looks good...finishing GH release
[00:39:20] <headius> https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6861408769415491584
[00:39:22] <enebo[m]> no emails yet but that ended up being a good thing
[00:40:26] <headius> https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/qlebhe/jruby_92200_released/
[00:41:56] <headius> enebo: I tried to merge 9.2 to 9.3 and had a conflict I could not fix in your SyntaxError patch
[00:42:23] <enebo[m]> ok I can merge...
[00:42:25] <headius> everything else merges ok so maybe you can take a look at that
[00:43:53] <enebo[m]> sure
[00:44:31] <enebo[m]> updating version to SHAPSHOT
[00:45:46] <headius> https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pull/11227
[00:45:57] <headius> lol SHAPSHOT
[00:46:06] <headius> if only it were SHAPSNOT
[00:46:28] <enebo[m]> can you do ruby-build?
[00:46:49] <headius> and ruby-versions? I'm fine officially taking those along with docker
[00:46:53] <enebo[m]> I almost updated our irc/matric
[00:46:57] <headius> hah
[00:46:59] <enebo[m]> yeah that would be great
[00:47:03] <headius> yeah fun with branch maintenance
[00:47:27] <enebo[m]> I also noticed we still have 9.1 listed in downloads
[00:47:28] <enebo[m]> We should probably kill that section
[00:49:13] <headius> https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-versions/pull/56
[00:49:28] <headius> hah yeah kill it
[00:53:24] <headius> https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build/pull/1818
[00:53:27] <headius> I think that's everything
[00:54:11] <enebo[m]> Man some releases are like pulling teeth
[00:54:23] <headius> what now
[00:54:26] <enebo[m]> This one in the end was not very stressful but it was time consuming
[00:54:36] <enebo[m]> I pushed 3 releases
[00:54:36] <ahorek[m]> https://github.com/rvm/rvm/pull/5145
[00:54:50] <enebo[m]> ahorek: thanks!
[00:54:55] <headius> ah yeah blame me for not getting everything necessary for that backport FFI
[00:55:04] <headius> enebo: we should add that to the list
[00:55:06] <headius> rvm update
[00:55:31] <headius> 9.2 will be around a while longer so we need to figure out a CI solution that also tests Windows
[00:55:37] <enebo[m]> but shit happens.  I think it is just normal to expect things to sometimes not be right
[00:55:41] <headius> right now nothing is working in CI for 9.2
[00:56:23] <enebo[m]> but we were not testing 9.2 on windows were we?
[00:56:31] <headius> hopefully we can give up 9.2 when 9.4 comes out
[00:56:42] <headius> "were not testing" other than what you run at release time
[00:56:48] <enebo[m]> I am not saying we shouldn't but I am blanking
[00:57:04] <enebo[m]> yeah I admit that is suboptimial
[00:57:13] <headius> yeah I mean if we had a simple job that just tried to install rails and run it would have caught this early
[00:57:20] <enebo[m]> 9.3 is when we start to pull out of that
[00:57:26] <headius> we have one windows job on 9.3/master
[00:57:43] <headius> at the very least we may have to migrate 9.2 on up off travis completely now
[00:57:43] <enebo[m]> we don't run rails in any ci runs anywhere atm
[00:57:50] <enebo[m]> but we do install gems I am sure
[00:58:22] <enebo[m]> I have thought about making runner part of it but we have so many jobs already
[00:58:32] <enebo[m]> maybe check-versions could also run rails
[01:00:33] <headius> yeah I just want to turn your verification into a simple smoke test
[01:00:44] <headius> save you the hassle of finding those issues on the day
[01:00:53] <headius> I'm just looking out for you bro
[01:02:04] <enebo[m]> haha yeah.  admittedly having a simple run would tag errors when they first occured too
[01:05:36] <headius> yeah
[01:06:13] <headius> ok

[21:10:33] <edipofederle[m]> Hi Guys,
[21:10:33] <edipofederle[m]> There some thing wrong here, or I miss something:
[21:10:33] <edipofederle[m]> MRI: `(..1).step(1).class` => Enumerator::ArithmeticSequence
[21:10:33] <edipofederle[m]> JRUBY: `(..1).step(1).class` => Enumerator
[21:12:51] <edipofederle[m]>  * Hi Guys,
[21:12:51] <edipofederle[m]> There some thing wrong here, or I'm missing something:
[21:12:51] <edipofederle[m]> MRI: `(..1).step(1).class` => Enumerator::ArithmeticSequence
[21:12:51] <edipofederle[m]> JRUBY: `(..1).step(1).class` => Enumerator
[22:00:11] <enebo[m]> edipo.federle: jruby -e 'p (1..).step(1).class'
[22:00:33] <enebo[m]> You will see it correct for endless range so however that is done needs to be done for beginless
[22:22:35] <edipofederle[m]> enebo:  yes, for endless range, 
[22:24:14] <edipofederle[m]> <enebo[m]> "You will see it correct for..." <- Sorry, if I got it right, there is fix need here?
[22:25:02] <enebo[m]> endless is reporting the right thing which is the ArithmeticSequence
[22:25:16] <enebo[m]> beginless needs same thing
[22:25:49] <edipofederle[m]> enebo[m]: yes,
[22:26:08] <enebo[m]> I have not looked at this at all but I can see we do it for endless so it must be a similar pattern for hookng up beginless
[22:26:43] <edipofederle[m]> yep, just wanna to confirm, I am working on "Can be sliced with Enumerator::ArithmeticSequence" and notice that. 
[22:27:06] <edipofederle[m]> I will check how it is done by endless 
[22:27:18] <enebo[m]> yeah and I did notice that as one of our failing tests in I think test:mri
[22:28:17] <edipofederle[m]> right, should I open a Issue for that or I can try to fix and send a pull-request?
[22:35:36] <enebo[m]> edipo.federle: for anything for 3.0 just open a PR
[22:36:07] <enebo[m]> edipo.federle: once we get to a point we decide to tag out failing tests we will switch to issues+prs but that will be a while
