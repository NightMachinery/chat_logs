[00:01:00] <KillAnimals> kakuhen: odd question, but do you think it would be useful to write a book that teaches you triginometry using c++? In the sense where you write your equations using that language?
[00:01:44] <kakuhen> if you're focusing entirely on numerical methods, you can probably get away with that, but otherwise I fail to see how you could do this

[00:02:37] <KillAnimals> kakuhen: Interesting. What is something you would be unable to express in c++?
[00:03:19] <kakuhen> well, it'd be tedious to derive the basic trigonometric identities
[00:03:41] <kakuhen> and demonstrating examples of them would require a huge detour into floating points
[00:04:00] <kakuhen> and that would only serve to confuse people new to trigonometry imo
[00:04:37] <kakuhen> you assert this equation holds and then you end up having to say "oh but you dont actually use == for floats because there is always some unknown loss of precision  that occurs for numbers with an infnite binary expansion; thus we must fix an epsilon > 0 and use that as a tolerance for declaring equality"
[00:04:39] <KillAnimals> kakuhen: I feel like algebra would be easier in c++.
[00:05:08] <cherim> Just to make me understand what the talk is about, can you express the statement of Bloch-Kato https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_residue_isomorphism_theorem#Statement in C++ here?
[00:05:22] <kakuhen> by algebra he doesnt mean what we mean when we say algebra :P
[00:05:47] <kakuhen> he means high school algebra, so things like completing the square and quadratic equation and what not
[00:05:57] <KillAnimals> basically.
[00:06:42] <kakuhen> well, the sieving algorithm will probably be interesting as a demonstration to students learning about factorization for the first time
[00:06:54] <KillAnimals> `if ( x**2 == -1 ) { ... }`
[00:06:56] <kakuhen> but then you'll probably lose them when you show them any code, and you can quickly derail with this topic

[00:11:09] <KillAnimals> kakuhen: Binary ultimately, sure, but c++ is a good medium where binary can still be expressed, and often is in things like bitmasks
[00:11:46] <KillAnimals> if someone writes a recursive function, I'd probably give them an F and tell them to write better code.

[00:13:12] <kakuhen> but that isnt the only place where recurrence relations appear
[00:13:19] <kakuhen> in day 1 of combinatorics you will see pascal's identity, for instance
[00:13:23] <KillAnimals> kakuhen: oh right somethign like that.

[00:14:35] <kakuhen> an iterative version of pascal's identity sounds even more tedious to write than the recursive one
[00:14:55] <kakuhen> and as far as teaching basic math goes, you'd have to be trying hard to make a mistake here

[00:16:44] <kakuhen> a variant of lisp; one of its outstanding features is that RnRS (one of the formal specifications for a scheme) mandates TCO and a bunch of other stuff that make recursion work better/faster in your language.
[00:16:58] <kakuhen> but this is borderline off-topic
[00:17:23] <kakuhen> my point is that, if you want to teach recurrence relations and anything to do with them with programming, then you will have to bite the bullet and accept that recursion is appropriate for these circumstances.

[01:15:49] <VzxPLnHqr> when performing an experiement where you are tossing N distinguishable fair coins, most physics/math books seem to define N+1 possible macrostates based on how many of the N coins are heads (or, eqivalently, the number of tails). However, couldn't we also just as easily define N+1 macrostates based on, for example, "the largest number of heads in a row"?
[01:17:04] <cherim>  You can, but that also requires an ordering on coins in addition to them being distinguishable
[01:17:36] <VzxPLnHqr> so a result of HHHTH for N=5 would be, in the typical/textbook examples, in the macrostate "4 heads." But it would be in the macrostate of "3 heads in a row" for the second example.

[01:22:35] <VzxPLnHqr> in other words, these particular definitions for parittioning into macrostates do not seem mutually exclusive.

[02:25:51] <VzxPLnHqr> cherim, sorry for my delay, could you unpack your statement about guessing the power of h a little bit?
[02:26:10] <cherim> There is nothing deep
[02:26:22] <cherim> Suppose you have access to a stream of y's
[02:26:35] <VzxPLnHqr> let's say that x is not uniformly random (or, rather, you simply know nothing about x whatsoever other than it's domain)
[02:27:27] <cherim> You still need some assumptions on prior distribution of x
[02:27:35] <cherim> Otherwise you can't progress at all
[02:28:05] <VzxPLnHqr> right, so with a stream of y's, you could at-minimum, count the "number of heads" for each
[02:28:48] *** Joins: gggp (~textual@125.33.92.174)
[02:28:52] <cherim> OK, you counted heads. How does it help?

[02:30:01] <cherim> You know the usual prior-posterior scheme? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability
[02:30:03] <cherim> Etc.
[02:30:50] <VzxPLnHqr> well, if the number of heads is far away from N/2 then i can "expect" (i think?) it took more work for you to find that particular y and give it to me than if it had N/2 heads
[02:31:16] <cherim> Why? Maybe just the x generator was biased
[02:32:11] <VzxPLnHqr> yeah, i'm not an expert in the prior prior-posterior scheme, but i think i mostly understand it.
[02:32:56] <cherim> Here the prior probability relates to choice of x and the power of h (and probably the range of functions where h may lie in). You assume something about those, then observe y's, then make an eductaed guess
[02:32:57] <VzxPLnHqr> in this case it doesn't matter whether the x generator is biased or not, because the function h that x is passed to is the thing that you do know
[02:33:05] *** Quits: bosspotato (~bosspotat@user/bosspotato) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[02:33:34] <cherim> So you know h? That simplifies stuff. But the generator of x is still important
[02:33:48] <cherim> Can I assume h is a permutation for now?
[02:34:16] <VzxPLnHqr> yah, to make it concrete (and give an example that may not be a bijection), let's assume that h = sha256 (as in the sha256 hash function used in cryptography)
[02:34:32] <cherim> I don't remember it's bijectivity properties
[02:34:41] <cherim> *its
[02:35:09] <cherim> Let h be any 1-1. Then any fixed power of h is also 1-1
[02:35:19] <VzxPLnHqr> ah, ok, then yes, let's assume h is a permutation (not sha256 since i don't know it's specific bijective properties either, i just assumed it was not bijective)
[02:36:05] <cherim> h^k  transforms distributions on x to distributions on y
[02:36:25] <VzxPLnHqr> right, i'm tracking with you so far
[02:36:53] <cherim> Whichever distribution on y you observe, and whichever k you guess, h^{-k}y is some distribution on the generator of x
[02:37:08] <VzxPLnHqr> (i think we can pretty much assume, but probalby can't prove, bijectivity of h(x) = sha256(sha256(x)))

[02:37:21] <cherim> It's best tuned to what you are observing
[02:37:45] <cherim> You need a way to say that some resulting generators on x are less likely than others to get any preference for k
[02:38:15] <VzxPLnHqr> interesting, yes, i think i am following

[02:44:34] <VzxPLnHqr> sorry that was a bad use of words...i mean i want you to be able to tell me which one of y or z "probably" took more time for its creator to find
[02:45:12] <cherim> And how are y, z obtained?

[02:46:39] <cherim> You say "no matter" a lot where it matters
[02:47:20] <VzxPLnHqr> but since outputs of h are uniform pseudorandom (and this you do know, because we agreed on h beforehand)

[02:48:20] <cherim> x, y, z, are N-bit vectors. x is generated uniformly at random among vectors with exactly one 1 and N-1 os. h is a cyclic shift by 1.
[02:48:40] <cherim> You get y=001000000 and z=000010000
[02:48:48] <cherim> Clearly you can say nothing?
[02:50:02] <VzxPLnHqr> yes, except the h i'm referring to, in expecation, would have N/2 1s and N/2 0s
[02:51:21] <VzxPLnHqr> so perhaps that is where we are crossing paths...the h i'm referring to would be extremely difficult to find the y and z you gave
[02:51:44] <VzxPLnHqr> and for N larger than, say, 256 it would be infeasible
[02:52:38] <cherim> I get the impression that in your view people who generate y, z first look at them and decide whether they want to give them to you or not
[02:52:46] <cherim> By some algorithm
[02:53:06] <VzxPLnHqr> "extremely difficult" here means "takes a lot of trials" and the reason i "know" that (i am arguing) is that the odds of only getting on 1 and the rest zeros is small compared to the odds of pretty much any other output
[02:53:19] <cherim> It's not true that the more shuffles you apply, the more exotic the statistic of 1s is
[02:53:47] <cherim> Only if you specifically select the "best" result
[02:54:03] <cherim> Then the more you try, the more exotic stuff has a chance to appear

[03:55:59] <Gustavo6046> Or maybe this subset U' that I was talking about earlier.
[03:56:21] <Gustavo6046> As long as there exists a C(a,b) : U^2 -> U' that can combine them.
[03:56:34] <qergle> that is a nice (and hard) problem about coin flipping distribution information content
[03:56:44] <Gustavo6046> Or a C : U^n -> U'_n
[03:56:58] <qergle> but i find you can get very challenging or at least counter-common-intuition problems with very simple setup

[14:04:34] <Hory> riv, well if types are interpreted as some kind of collection, the items in the collections can vary even if they have the same "structure"
[14:04:57] <Hory> for example in set theory there can be different relations with the same domains / codomains
[14:08:58] <Hory> so I'm asking if in the concept of a product type there is latitude for some undefined difference or if they are strictly defined
[14:11:51] <riv> I do not understand

[14:12:26] <int-e> I think "if" is used here in the sense it's often used in definitions... as "if and only if".
[14:13:27] <int-e> The "if" direction is, of course, trivial. The "only if" direction is generally true in type theories, despite being false in set theory (if one of the sets is empty).

[17:43:10] <dude12312414> the cos term has frequency |f1 - f2|/2, but the maxima actually happen twice as fast because the high frequency oscillations will quickly go between +1 and -1, so the sign of the envelope term becomes irrelevant

[18:10:12] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]:  a small lesson you can take from that exercise up there is that when checking for  a + bi  being unit length (I don't think I'd use the word "unital" in this context), it suffices to get see that  a^2 + b^2 = 1.  No sqrt needed.
