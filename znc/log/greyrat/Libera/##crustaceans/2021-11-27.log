[00:03:08] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: glad it didn't take a walk
[00:10:58] <skyl4rk> gerikson: not sure I understand how it's racist, it's a pun on the name of the leader in China, not Chinese people as a whole.

[00:46:12] <gwozniak> My friends were telling me how they ordered food from some place that used a delivery service and the delivery person dropped the food at the front door and left.  They didn't know the food was there and figured it out about half an hour later

[00:51:45] <gerikson> yeah that sounds tough
[00:51:51] <gwozniak> And the spouse can't do anything because they refuse to wear a mask, too

[00:58:40] <hoistbypetard> gerikson: i wonder if /dev/random is just taking forever on a vps?

[00:58:54] <gerikson> hoistbypetard: most probably
[00:59:01] <gerikson> it just hangs
[00:59:20] <skyl4rk> might be the issue then, see if urandom fares better
[01:00:14] <gerikson> works better, thanks!
[01:01:48] <skyl4rk> cool, using random instead of urandom may or may not be recommended, don't remember, but the important thing here is of course how hard I can golf it (I say, and use not one, but two invocations of dd)

[01:28:41] <Brekkjern> What is it supposed to be called now?
[01:29:13] <Brekkjern> I haven't been paying attention

[01:37:03] <ben> thanks buttsbot
[01:37:24] <ben> what do you mean by "doing covid"
[01:37:57] <kline> ben, theyve just given up on masks, social distancing, etc, and wont be reapplying these measures if govt asks
[01:38:06] <kline> its a news item even in the uk just now
[01:38:12] <ben> ah yep, have noticed that here too

[01:38:30] <ben> my wife and i both got covid back in august but luckily we were already vaccinated

[01:42:22] <hoistbypetard> ha. so you've found it now?
[01:45:40] <gwozniak> yes. and I got access
[01:45:57] <gwozniak> all is well, aside from the fact I set up everything on the wrong machine ;)
[01:59:26] <ngoldbaum> they just recently reinstituted a mask mandate here
[01:59:33] <ngoldbaum> only like 4 months late

[06:29:28] <companion_cube> I don't think I have the motivation for such shenanigans, tbh
