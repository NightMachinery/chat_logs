[06:20:13] <websec> ^ GTA Online mod for PC may have introduced Trojan - JustPaste.it
[06:21:18] <Descartes> I looked up the file on Virus Total and looked up the website I weblinked here on Securi Site Check before I installed it, and it looked ok, but it appears that the installed program is preventing me from getting my Windows Updates and may be disabling other native security apps that protect Windows 10.  So I'm trying to get rid of it.
[06:22:39] <Descartes> Does anyone have some advice on how to get rid of it?  I ran a bunch of Windows Defender and Malwarebytes scans and didn't find anything.
[06:23:40] <ajak> have you tried trying to get rid of it rather than trying to scan it to death?

[06:23:53] <ajak> what have you tried? how has it failed?
[06:24:18] <Descartes> My brother tried to get rid of it, but couldn't find out where it was installed
[06:25:01] <Descartes> It looks like it's in the registry, but my brother suspects it may have replaced some of the Rockstar Games files
[06:25:39] <ajak> so verify game integrity in steam
[06:25:59] <Descartes> But I don't think it put any files into the Rockstar Games folders, because the mod menu never worked and never affected the game when it was running, cause I tried using it and it failed.
[06:26:10] <Descartes> GTA Online is not running on Steam
[06:26:19] <Descartes> It's running on EpicGames
[06:26:43] <ajak> try whatever utility for that that that offers
[06:27:41] <Descartes> Also, the mod menu was actually running separately from the game, as an independent menu, and it was not working, so didn't change any of the game's properties or settings, fortunately.

[06:28:59] <ajak> if you're concerned about everything then throw away the machine
[06:29:22] <Descartes> One of my friends who was using an older version of the menu, said the newer version I have installed can cause your operating system to lag
[06:30:08] <Descartes> If I knew any of that stuff, I never would have installed such a stupid mod menu.  I don't even need the mod menu, so it was really stupid to install it in the first place.
[06:31:03] <Descartes> GTA Online was running fine without the mod menu, and I never had any problems before I installed it.
[06:31:47] <Descartes> In fact, GTA Online still runs fine with EpicGames, but I have serious concerns about the integrity and security of my currrent Windows 10 OS
[06:32:42] <Descartes> I'm even thinking of uninstalling Epic Games and Rockstar Games completely, just to get rid of the malicious files that my brother assumes I have introduced by installing the mod menu
[06:33:15] <ajak> if you think you've been rootkitted, throw away the whole system
[06:33:30] <Descartes> He said if I uninstall Epic Games and GTA Online, then it may get rid of any malicious code
[06:33:54] <Descartes> wouldn't a rootkit have shown up in the scans?

[07:09:10] <Descartes> I already backed up all my personal files.  I just want to find the location of the malcious code on my registry.  Would an external scan with Kaspersky Rescue disk find anything?
[07:09:20] <thumbs> Descartes: wipe the OS
[07:10:23] <Descartes> If I wipe the OS and install the image backup, I could end up with a lot of problems, because the backups are so old.  A lot of customizations and new programs have been installed since then.
[07:11:05] <Descartes> it would be easier to just hunt down the malicious code, and if I don't find anything, may be I could keep running Windows and see what happens

[07:12:47] <Descartes> It would be nice if I could get more hard drive space to backup my OS, but I can't afford to buy new drives.  I'm trying to make do with the hardware I have now
[07:14:03] <Descartes> And I've been really careful about installing anything new.  I always research everything and read up in the forums before I install anything.  After 10 years of doing that, that stupid mod menu was uncharacteristically irresponsible and indulgent of me.
[07:14:32] <thumbs> Descartes: then make a new backup with the recent important data?
[07:14:54] <Descartes> But it's my only mistake after 10 years of being careful with the security of all my machines and all the operating systems I use.

[20:03:16] <piou> very good https://dirtypipe.cm4all.com/ -> tl;dr: new privilege escalation on linux, similar to dirty cow from some years ago, based on a pipe bug. This allows an unprivileged user to write arbitrary data into privileged files. The writeup is nice too.
