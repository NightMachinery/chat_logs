[02:05:16] <Hunterkll> and i'm like
[02:05:19] <Hunterkll> VRML in 2003 
[02:05:29] <Hunterkll> with a book I found at ollies discount store

[02:07:20] <Hunterkll> what people are doing with it has regressed compared to those times
[02:07:29] <Hunterkll> but the hardware's more readily accessible 
[02:07:39] <sd> 12<u​norganized account> i mean depends
[02:07:44] <Hunterkll> instead of just us ing local like browser based renderers

[02:08:09] <Hunterkll> I wouldn't even say better

[02:08:19] <sd> 12<u​norganized account> i mean with the index
[02:08:26] <Hunterkll> I remember a rig I saw in ~2004 that is far better then those full room setups you buy these days for playing games

[02:08:53] <Hunterkll> lol
[02:09:01] <Hunterkll> but again, more accessible means tradeoffs
[02:09:35] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> so, to sum up effectively, Hunterkll thinks that instead of wasting your time in a framework laptop, you should invest in late 90s/early 2000's VR tech

[07:11:10] <Kiernian> the look on his face while he was trying to decide if I actually thought that was necessary (and was therefore an idiot) or not was priceless

[07:21:47] <lemming> Got a fun one atm, anyone ever seen a situation where wmiprvse.exe creates a bunch of .vdf files in c:\windows\temp?
[07:21:48] <Kiernian> after about a week and probably the 18th or 20th time he'd seen me do it, he finally said "you realize you can just type one when you need it, right?" to which I replied something like "yeah, but I've already got extras. I save them just in case." The joke was up shortly after that because I couldn't keep a straight face
[07:22:08] <lemming> on one of our servers it's creating about 4 of them a minute at 200kb each, so it's chewing up space resonably fast.
[07:23:28] <Kiernian> are the first letters of those vdf files "HP"? and if so...got any hp printers?
[07:23:40] <lemming> nope, but yes we have HP printers
[07:24:02] <lemming> there's no HP apps installed on the server that I can see though, and those are the normal culprit there.

[07:26:52] <Kiernian> yeah, but what's calling wmiprvse?
[07:26:54] <Molnija> ok, so, first, what installed wmiprvse
[07:27:00] <lemming> they're sqlite 3 files, with a bunch of stuff in there about printers, but nothing that points to a specific driver.

[08:12:04] <misspwn> you could make some pretty amazing baked eggs in a big ass pan
[08:12:14] <enix> who's poor?
[08:12:17] <misspwn> some would call that a crustless quiche or whatever but it's filling
[08:12:32] <Cl0udNinja> enix, are you dumping the whole db at once, or table by table?
[08:12:33] <sd> 03<A​rlion> a man shouldn't be deciding between eggs or vegetables in america (or canada)
[08:12:41] <misspwn> couple eggs scrambled with a splash of milk over a pat of butter and make an omlette
[08:12:45] <Molnija> Arlion, we don't have venmo here
[08:12:48] <enix> Cl0udNinja, I'm doing a couple of tables but getting stuck on large objects
[08:12:49] <Cl0udNinja> you may have to just individually export tables and reassemble on the other side
[08:12:53] <Molnija> also no
[08:13:06] <jay-ros> yah a 'whatever's cheap' fritatta would go pretty well
[08:13:10] <enix> one tables too large unfortunately
[08:13:13] <Cl0udNinja> also maybe your client or server side config need a fix for large packet sizes?
[08:13:23] <enix> Also when I'm poor; quinoa, black beans, some currants/sultanas, and some sort of sauce
[08:13:24] <sd> 03<A​rlion> uhhh.. btc?
[08:13:24] <misspwn> everything but the kitchen sink and baked would keep for a while 
[08:13:37] <enix> Cl0udNinja, got a link regarding that last part? 
[08:13:41] <Cl0udNinja> uhm
[08:13:42] <Molnija> i accept ltc, but also no
[08:13:50] <sd> 03<A​rlion> oh yeah, get those green onions and stick em in water.
[08:13:54] <sd> 03<A​rlion> boom, double onions
[08:13:57] <enix> ltc is still a thing :\
[08:14:07] <jay-ros> tinned tomatoes and frozen peas and corn go a good distance too
[08:14:21] <enix> ah yeah, TVP + Dolmios + Spag
[08:14:25] <sd> 03<A​rlion> ltc is my coin of choice when i want to dodge volatility
[08:14:42] <enix> Glad LTC has stuck to it's core values
[08:14:43] <misspwn> and uhhh Molnija honestly if it really came down to it, eat the rice with all that. or check your local food pantry i know those things exist maybe they are called something else but pride doesn't feed us

[08:15:00] <misspwn> i've been in those shoes so many times
[08:15:06] <Molnija> 12 eggs, plus drawing down my frozen chicken supply, only needs to last me 4 days
[08:15:13] <enix> "Migorang costs too much" :\
[08:15:27] <misspwn> you'll be fine on that
[08:15:27] <Molnija> if i was to buy 12 eggs

[08:16:57] <sd> 03<A​rlion> okay, i might be drunk
[08:17:01] <misspwn> oh Canada has 211 just like we do, give them a ring
[08:17:03] <Cl0udNinja> enix, I found conflicting info that it is possible to configure that though
[08:17:05] <enix> Gluten Flour, if available, will make you feel full and give a lot of protein
[08:17:08] <jay-ros> There was a chinese supermarket near a place I lived which did super-cheap lentils and chickpeas, that was an easy lunch which cost about a buck twenty when I was hitting end of month
[08:17:09] <Cl0udNinja> but thats not what I was looking for
[08:17:19] <enix> I used to put gluten flour in my bread to fill me up
[08:17:30] <enix> Cl0udNinja, IDK if it's going to solve the issue though

[08:17:49] <Cl0udNinja> oh
[08:17:52] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[08:17:55] <Cl0udNinja> you need a larger RDS
[08:18:02] <Cl0udNinja> *just*for exporting

[08:18:14] <enix> like are you kidding ;\
[08:18:17] <Cl0udNinja> heh
[08:18:33] <enix> Honestly I feel like that would fix it but idk if i can redo this instance size rn
[08:18:47] <Cl0udNinja> enix, this is one of many reasons I was not a fan of RDS at all
[08:18:57] <enix> Yeah it's got it's + et -
[08:19:01] <Cl0udNinja> yep
[08:19:19] <enix> So essentially I feel like I'm looking at "break it down" or moar rams
[08:19:23] <Cl0udNinja> anyway the link I posted above should be available in your configs
[08:19:32] <Cl0udNinja> send_buffer_size and receiver_buffer_size
[08:19:36] <Cl0udNinja> that should help *some*
[08:19:58] <Cl0udNinja> but if a query is just eating memory trying to complete for a dump, the only thing you can do is scale up or refactor the db
[08:20:46] <enix> yeah i thought about address what we're doing, but that's going to be a log4j-level alert
[08:21:32] <Cl0udNinja> I think you could maybe do a mirror from postgres
[08:21:37] <Cl0udNinja> to an ec2 postgres
[08:21:40] <Cl0udNinja> and then dump from there
[08:22:24] <Cl0udNinja> at least that way you control the system performing the dump and you can just tell it to behave more strictly against oom
[08:22:35] <Molnija> misspwn: it's not my guts
[08:22:51] <enix> I had a search around for finding some sort of 'awsy' way of doing it, didn't think of that though
[08:23:07] <Molnija> enix: ngl i am not a fan of gluten
[08:23:20] <enix> Molnija, gluten flour ie seitan?
[08:23:26] <Molnija> ye
[08:23:40] <enix> is it a celiac-type thing or just a flavor-type thing
[08:23:52] <Cl0udNinja> enix, yeah, I'm pretty sure you could make a readonly mirror from rds to an ec2 and then dump it there
[08:24:30] <Cl0udNinja> I cant imagine what kind of data you're tryin to dump thats oom'ing such a large rds instance
[08:25:39] <enix> honestly, i think someone went full retard
[08:25:41] <Cl0udNinja> although... there was that one time a developer managed to create a 256MB *query*
[08:26:11] <Kiernian> Like...the text that comprised the query was 256mb of ascii characters?
[08:26:13] <Cl0udNinja> yes

[08:26:19] <Kiernian> hooooooooly fuck
[08:26:27] <Cl0udNinja> I wish I'd kept a copy of that query, and the source that generated it

[08:26:56] <Molnija> Cl0udNinja: I'm not even mad.
[08:27:19] <Cl0udNinja> they would do 5 queries back to back of selects, and then they'd build that into an array, and then the query generator in code would 'or _column_ = <val>' them together
[08:27:24] <Kiernian> I thought RedGate software produced some whacked out auto generated queries but that's...dude.

[08:28:22] <Cl0udNinja> I actually forced a meeting with the entire dev team over it, and was like 'WHY WOULD YOU EVEN LET THIS THROUGH MERGE REQUEST APPROVAL, LET ALONE QA'

[08:29:23] <Cl0udNinja> I only caught it because CEO came to me like 'why is our db system freaking the fuck out all the time now'
[08:29:46] <Molnija> was it 256 mega decimal bytes or 256 mega binary bytes?
[08:30:02] <Cl0udNinja> 256 * 1024 * 1024
[08:30:07] <Molnija> binary then
[08:30:12] * Molnija sighs
[08:30:17] <Cl0udNinja> their entire db design was so terrible that you could basically not have more than 1 customer connected without losing its shit
[08:30:37] <Molnija> i lied about the half a pound of cocoa
[08:30:39] <Molnija> oh well
[08:30:45] <sd> 03<A​rlion> just throw more  resources at it? > every db i have ever known
[08:30:49] <Cl0udNinja> I had to monkeyfuck it, and built a multitude of DB clusters for specific operations that were all mirrored together
[08:30:54] <enix> Literally every time I see a commercial database I think that maybe I'm just a super retard at databasing
[08:30:57] <enix> And sometimes that's the case
[08:31:05] <enix> Other times, the DBA runs off and takes credit for my owrk.
[08:31:10] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[08:31:15] <enix> Some people just dont have a concept of things
[08:31:29] <Kiernian> 268435456 characters, averaging 22 character per line of code that's twelve million lines of SQL query
[08:31:41] <Molnija> A severe lack of object permanence skills
[08:32:18] <Cl0udNinja> yeah this was pretty bad, like, we had to make 4 clusters of readonly DB servers with 4+ servers each and a single master, and each one only allowed specific queries to be run.
[08:32:46] <Cl0udNinja> that made things much better, but every time they added a new query I'd go buy a bottle of alcohol and pray that they remembered not to run it on master
[08:33:21] <Molnija> like at this stage, just use an NFS share as the database
[08:33:25] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[08:33:40] <Molnija> probably be more reliable, somehow.

[11:48:57] <Molnija> ee
[11:49:12] <lancehead> Hi Molnija, what's up 
[11:49:27] <Molnija> just bein a dragon, per usual
[11:49:29] <Molnija> being broke
[11:49:52] <lancehead> A broke dragon? Aren't you supposed to have a treasure hoard?
[11:50:03] <Molnija> uhh
[11:50:05] <Molnija> no?
[11:50:20] <lancehead> Huh. The Hobbit lied to me, how unexpected
[11:50:34] <Molnija> There's different kinds of dragons
[11:50:51] <Kiernian> if the reagan years did anything to us, it's to make it so that wealth takes time to accumulate
[11:51:08] <Molnija> time and starvation
[11:51:21] <lancehead> Fair enough, maybe you're just not old enough to be rich
[11:51:59] <lancehead> I do have a treasure hoard. Of support tickets today (help)
[11:59:03] <lancehead> I just realized one of my new colleagues has formal shoes with cowboy spurs... what the fuck?
[12:02:20] <SirSceptalot> morning lancehead 
[12:02:31] <SirSceptalot> did he ride in on a horse?
[12:02:45] <SirSceptalot> or on a plural that sounds exactly like horse?
[12:03:51] <lancehead> God, I hope not 
[12:03:55] <lancehead> Hi SirSceptalot, what's up 
[12:04:22] <lancehead> Found your intern some work yet?
[12:04:37] <SirSceptalot> I've stuck him on the knowbe4 platform
[12:04:52] <SirSceptalot> gave him a few test users to play with
[12:05:06] <lancehead> You actually used my idea? Damn 
[12:05:07] <SirSceptalot> he should be good with that for a while
[12:05:11] <lancehead> Finally something I do made it into prod
[12:05:12] <SirSceptalot> I did, it was a good idea
[12:05:15] <SirSceptalot> lol
[12:05:22] <lancehead> :(
[12:06:01] <lancehead> I'm working on my final project assignment school thingymadoo
[12:06:05] <SirSceptalot> at the moment I'm looking into fixing an "issue" with a bending press
[12:06:22] <lancehead> That made no sense. Basically I have to do two projects at my internship and document them
[12:06:36] <lancehead> Is the "issue" someone being stuck in it?
[12:06:38] <SirSceptalot> "issue" is in quotes because it works as intended, but the user simply doesn't know how to use the interface he used every day for the last ten years
[12:06:51] <lancehead> Ah
[12:07:10] <lancehead> Yikes lol 
[12:07:21] <SirSceptalot> obviously that's some sort of custom shell, and the "issue" is in there, it's not actually a problem
[12:07:28] <SirSceptalot> he somehow locked his ability to modify the cnc files
[12:07:44] <lancehead> >_> 
[12:08:05] <SirSceptalot> so my guess is he just logged off as "insteller" and just logged in as viewer/prod
[12:08:16] <SirSceptalot> just found a cd which hopefully has the manual
[12:08:34] <SirSceptalot> since obviously nobody knows where the physical manual is either
[12:08:48] <lancehead> lol that'd be somewhat stupid if he's been using it for ten years

[12:10:19] <SirSceptalot> ehm
[12:10:27] <SirSceptalot> there's "bediener" and "insteller" I would assume
[12:10:35] <lancehead> Ohh I see okay 
[12:10:49] <SirSceptalot> since not everyone needs to make cnc programs, you can have guys that just need to be able to use the machine but not set it up
[12:11:33] <lancehead> Gotcha. Should set different passkeys for them to prevent accidental switching
[12:13:29] <nobyk> Is this german?

[12:40:16] <SirSceptalot> very fine finger dexterity is also a big part of it
[12:40:43] <SirSceptalot> there are some people that have an injury in the part of the brain that controls fine dexterity

[12:45:13] <lancehead> I do
[12:45:17] <Molnija> I hope you jest
[12:45:19] <SirSceptalot> making fun of users is somewhat of a steeple of being in IT. I do it too, but mostly I do respect the individual people
[12:45:31] <Molnija> The sysadmins I've run across tend to be for real.
[12:45:38] <SirSceptalot> hm
[12:45:47] <Molnija> I guess I've run across some shonky, shonky sysadmins then, hey?
[12:45:50] <lancehead> I mean, I am somewhat; people do a lot of dumb shit. But I still respect them 
[12:46:03] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Users? More like lusers.
[12:46:07] <lancehead> AYYYY
[12:46:08] <SirSceptalot> it's probably not even limited to IT work. People that work on cars probably also call their "users" idiots all the time
[12:46:40] <lancehead> Probably more than us, mechanics are assholes
[12:46:42] <Molnija> I have seen those "driver said it ran a little rough" compilos
[12:46:56] <teh_f4ll3n> I've definitely been called a "fucking idiot" by my bike mechanic. to my face
[12:47:08] <teh_f4ll3n> in jest, but still :)
[12:47:10] <SirSceptalot> motorcycle bike or bicycle bike?
[12:47:15] <teh_f4ll3n> motorbike
[12:47:16] <Molnija> Get a new mechanic if you can.
[12:47:28] <teh_f4ll3n> nah, we're good friends
[12:47:32] <SirSceptalot> nono, keep him
[12:47:40] <Molnija> That makes the dynamic a mite different
[12:47:40] <teh_f4ll3n> he knows his shit

[12:48:20] <teh_f4ll3n> "Stop downshifting at full throttle like a fucking idiot"
[12:48:43] <Molnija> I wish i'd a hand throttle for my car
[12:48:59] <Molnija> it'd make blip shifts easier
[12:49:34] <teh_f4ll3n> sometimes. I did all the networking at his new place a few years ago
[12:49:42] <Molnija> my booted right foot does not have the dexterity to do that and not lose traction on an ice road (yes, sometimes you need to downshift on an ice road
[12:49:44] <Molnija> )
[12:51:34] <lancehead> Imagine not downshifting in every corner
[12:51:49] <teh_f4ll3n> don't have to if you're in 1st
[12:52:03] * teh_f4ll3n taps temple
[12:52:20] <lancehead> Imagine being in 1st instead of over 60mph at all times
[12:52:27] <SirSceptalot> I do that
[12:52:31] <SirSceptalot> exactly that
[12:52:36] <lancehead> What?

[12:53:10] <lancehead> jk jk

[12:55:33] <Molnija> not all EVs
[12:55:41] <SirSceptalot> true
[12:55:44] <Molnija> if i did a conversion, i'd keep the gearbox
[12:55:47] <SirSceptalot> porsche and audi's have 2 I think
[12:55:53] <teh_f4ll3n> get a roll, get cheese, get ham - voila!
[12:55:58] <SirSceptalot> yeah with custom builds anything goes
[12:56:21] <Molnija> and i'd remap it so it drives like petrol above 1000rpm
[12:56:30] <lancehead> I like the environment, but being a car guy I just hate how quiet an EV is

[12:58:24] <lancehead> BMW M3 GTR for me

[12:59:23] <lancehead> Absolute monster of a car, that thing 
[12:59:37] <lancehead> And goddamn they sound good 
[12:59:51] <teh_f4ll3n> Yamaha YZF-R6 for me.
[13:00:09] <teh_f4ll3n> I'd get an R1, but I'd prolly kill myself on that
[13:00:33] <DrZak> bike - death
[13:00:48] <lancehead> Obviously I'm never actually owning an M3 GTR though, so for cars I can actually get my hands on it's probably a Volvo 242 swapped with the V10 from a BMW M5 
[13:01:15] <DrZak> tbh. 25 years ago i used to ride a commie bike from the 70ies in tshirt and shorts, it was great, roads were empty, one watched the world around, it was fun
[13:01:16] <lancehead> Because fun fact, that engine *just barely* drops into that engine bay
[13:01:24] <DrZak> now, i've seen a buddy get ready to ride
[13:01:37] <DrZak> i believe hockey goalies get ready sooner
[13:01:41] <lancehead> lol 
[13:02:08] <Molnija> my dream car is the one i currently have, but factory fresh, with runflat tyres, 4wd, a subtle lift, a couple more horsepower, oh and electric-with-genset drive technology, ideally with an engine that swaps as easily as a sas disk in a server, and a 70km range with the engine in but not running
[13:02:10] <lancehead> I wouldn't mind owning an old cafe racer. That'd be cool

[14:03:37] <SirSceptalot> I guess we'll never know
[14:03:56] <Molnija> ye
[14:08:36] <teh_f4ll3n> So... A web guy gets a call then runs up to me and asks why a client's website was suspended. I point at the clients account and the lack of any payments on it since October. He goes back to the phone and says "There's an issue with the server. We'll sort this out for you."
[14:08:40] <teh_f4ll3n> What?!
[14:08:54] <SirSceptalot> lol
[14:09:10] <lancehead> Damn your colleagues have a habit of lying huh 
[14:10:27] <teh_f4ll3n> I had to go up to him and make him ring the customer back to explain that they haven't paid us.
[14:10:33] <Molnija> Aha..
[14:10:45] <lancehead> jesus lol 
[14:11:01] <Molnija> Only way it's a server issue is if the server is mislogging their payments to another account,
[14:11:04] <Molnija> which happens.
[14:11:13] <teh_f4ll3n> not in this case
[14:11:15] <SirSceptalot> I don't really get what his gameplan was there
[14:11:33] <Molnija> trying to fire the client?
[14:11:34] <SirSceptalot> just re-enable it and hope he suddenly starts paying?
[14:11:46] <nobyk> I like doing database surgery
[14:11:49] <teh_f4ll3n> in this case the payments stopped because they cancelled the DD mandate
[14:11:56] <nobyk> taking records from one db and inserting them in another
[14:12:10] <Molnija> oh no
[14:12:12] <teh_f4ll3n> nobyk, been there, done that
[14:12:16] <SirSceptalot> nobyk, you sound like a mad scientist
[14:12:19] <Molnija> the client cancelled the PAD or the server?
[14:12:24] <SirSceptalot> IT'S ALIVE
[14:12:42] <nobyk> hah just add the columns with empty values if it's missing any
[14:12:46] <nobyk> I'm sure its fine
[14:12:49] <teh_f4ll3n> Direct Debit, Molnija 
[14:12:51] <nobyk> MUHAHAH
[14:12:57] <Molnija> PAD is canoodlian for direct debit
[14:13:04] <Molnija> it stands for pre-authorized debit
[14:13:15] <teh_f4ll3n> same thing then
[14:14:27] <teh_f4ll3n> nobyk, I had to merge records from one DB to another, unfortunately the record IDs were repeating in both. So... export as script, update record IDs, run script
[14:14:53] <teh_f4ll3n> like same ID, different data
[14:15:07] <nobyk> yeah
[14:15:16] <Molnija> it's not rocket science
[14:15:20] <teh_f4ll3n> took me hours
[14:15:30] <nobyk> It's not rocket science, it's fun!
[14:15:33] <teh_f4ll3n> it's database surgery

[21:27:06] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> I think the idea is the computer is basically alive
[21:27:33] <monr0e> No, our bodies are constantly being renewed. A non-living system might not be able to do that - you'd constantly be needing to reproduce the same data. Very inefficient
[21:28:19] <monr0e> I'm no expert though so I could be very wrong
[21:29:07] <koollman> dna doesn't degrade too fast if you store it properly

[23:11:24] <Bru^> yoah
[23:11:28] <koollman> I prefer to avoid zfs root anyway. still easier to manage/recover

[23:11:37] <Cl0udNinja> onenerdguy we expose an nfs as a datastore for vsphere and other shares

[23:13:33] <koollman> Cl0udNinja: I can understand that. I generally snapshot at the vm level, or just on the data storage part. and the physical machines don't really need snapshots for their / storage
[23:13:37] <Activ8> lol
[23:13:42] <Activ8> sorry
[23:14:15] <Cl0udNinja> koollman, we're a storage company, we make storage app/platform stuff, so generally stuff is hardware tied, however we've gotten our stuff working in VMs and Cloud stuff
[23:14:28] <koollman> right. different needs :)
[23:14:30] <Cl0udNinja> yeah
[23:14:42] <Cl0udNinja> we abuse the fuck out of ZFS
[23:15:24] <koollman> at work the hardware level mostly runs proxmox. and sometimes freebsd (pfsense), or linux without virtualisation (for routers). all of that can be wiped/reinstalled easily
[23:15:32] <javi404> mounting a snapshot to rsync is the shit bro
[23:15:52] <javi404> i have a disk dying, im procrastinating like crazy. lol
[23:15:53] <Cl0udNinja> we use dd and zfs send/recv for moving snapshots around
[23:15:57] <javi404> maybe tonight.
[23:15:59] <koollman> and any kind of service other that those is in a vm or lxc container. so ... pretty easy to manage
[23:16:01] <Cl0udNinja> or bbcp
[23:16:19] <javi404> Cl0udNinja: yeah, in a prod system that is what I would design, but this is plex+ work files.

[23:54:09] <DomLS3> that's not a valuid cmdlet
[23:54:35] <sd> 05<v​yz> are you trying to update phone # using on prem attribute?
[23:55:21] <DomLS3> no I'm trying to clear out that phone number. We are enabling MFA on a set of accounts and somehow these accounts have numbers already populated there and so when they go to login it's sending the codes to these prepopulated numbers and nobody knows what they are
[23:55:39] <DomLS3> so I'm essentially wanting to clear out all numbers so the next time they login it prompts them for a number to use
[23:56:42] <sd> 05<v​yz> gotcha, that cmdlet should work so long as u installed the associated module
[23:57:20] <DomLS3> I installed the module
[23:57:30] <DomLS3> there are several get-mg modules but the phone one is not available
