[00:47:29] <qergle> initially we knew effort varied. then i added some information, i told you how it varies (once you know motivation and interest levels)

[01:01:26] <audiocat> cuppajoeman, yea i've never heard of that either

[01:04:18] <cuppajoeman> Would this be the definition?
[01:04:25] <qergle> but all of sudden, this quantity that varies (effort), when it is revealed to us how it varies (as a function of two things) it stops making sense?
[01:04:49] <cuppajoeman> Hmm

[01:05:37] <cuppajoeman> kinda yes
[01:05:45] <cuppajoeman> because for me a function and a varaible are two different objects

[03:35:03] <qergle> ok

[03:40:44] <cherim> That's johnkeats department
[03:41:09] <cherim> *johnkeats6
[03:43:41] <Guest59> a particular solution is... -(1/3)x^3 + 2x ? Because -u'' = -(-x^2 + 2)= x^2 -2
[03:44:21] <somiaj> Guest59: you don't even need to worry about standard methods, -u'(x) = x^2 - 2 is a basic calculus problem, and though technically a DE, you don't need any DE methods for it
[03:44:54] <qergle> he has -u"(x), btw.
[03:45:09] <Guest59> i guess because then the integrand is continuous we can apply FTC
[03:45:27] <somiaj> arg, I miss typed, yea -u''(x), either way, if you are trying to use fancy DE methods for this, you are kinda missing it is a simple antideriavtive problem
[03:45:35] <Guest59> sorry
[03:45:37] <somiaj> Guest59: there is no integral here, so the FTC has no bearing on this problem.
[03:45:58] <Guest59> uhm, thats how we solve for u(x)  though?

[04:08:16] <qergle> ok, did you progress?
[04:11:32] <Guest59> uh so we have  -x^4/12 + x^2 - cx - d. Applying the first boundary condition -u(1) = 1 yields: -1/12 + 1 - c + d = 1, and applying the second boundary condition u'(1) + u(1) = 2 yields: -1/3 x^3 + 2x - c + (1/12 - 1 + c + d )= 2
[04:11:38] <Guest59> gross
[04:11:51] <Guest59> d  = c + 1/12
[04:12:03] <Guest59> er,
[04:12:19] <Guest59> -1/3 (1)^3 + 2(1) -c i meant
[04:12:20] <somiaj> where did -u(1)=1 come from, you told us -u'(0) = 1, which makes it much easier.
[04:12:33] <Guest59> uhhhh
[04:12:36] <Guest59> that's a mistake
[04:12:37] <qergle> you might want to apply first condition to -u' not all to u
[04:12:48] <Guest59> agh i needsome paper one second
[04:12:55] <qergle> and leave as negatives until end
[04:13:20] <somiaj> well if you have -u(1) = 1, then you have u(1) = -1, and thus u'(1) + u(1) = 2 is the same as u'(1) = 2 - u(1) = 2 - (-1) = 3
[04:14:10] <qergle> yes, i suggest we apply -u'(0)=1 to -u'(x) not at end
[04:14:26] <somiaj> though this isn't the same problem you told us to start with
[04:14:27] <qergle> then apply -u'(1)-u(1)=-2 at end
[04:15:20] <qergle> my preference at least
[04:21:56] <Guest59> I'm not sure its possible because we get 1 unknown from the integration constant and 2 unknowns from the homogenous solution. But we only have two boundary conditions
[04:22:01] <Guest59> 3 unknowns, 2 equations
[04:22:28] <qergle> no, it's possible, forget homogeneous. it's one or other.
[04:22:58] <somiaj> I was just trying to point you what you have is really just a calculus problem, no DE knowledge is really needed
[04:23:11] <qergle> my initial point is you get specific (by integrating twice) without regard to constants, then tack on homo at end.
[04:23:23] <somiaj> If you want to do the DE way, your particular solution must be a single solution, so it won't have an unknown constant in it
[04:23:24] <Guest59> Fine. From -u'' = x^2 -2 we obtain a solution u(x) = -x^4/12 + x^2 + C, C some constant
[04:23:30] <qergle> but then somiaj suggested just keeping track of indeterminate constants as you go. then no need to tack on homo
[04:24:09] <qergle> do one step, from -u"=x^2-2 what do you get for -u' ?
[04:24:17] <Guest59> but how is possible to satisfy two boudnary conditions with one unknown
[04:24:34] <somiaj> You don't have one unknown constant
[04:24:56] <qergle> if you integrate -u'' = x^2 -2, once what do you get?
[04:24:57] <Guest59> oh, from the second integration we get cx + d...whoops
[04:25:03] <qergle> yes
[04:25:28] <qergle> which is the cx+d you get on homo

[06:01:21] <XCode> surfaces
[06:01:24] <XCode> not curves

[06:04:00] <Decker> (err ||(a,b)|| I guess)

[06:05:48] <XCode> yes
[06:10:51] <Decker> well... I think that the issue might be ... (how to approach this) as you increase dimensions, what a surface intersects with becomes more complex... in 4D you need 6 cross products  ; where going up to 4, 3 in 3 and 1 in 2 works pretty good
[06:11:05] <Decker> because usually the 2d case is really a 1d rotation - or 1d complex

[06:32:04] <Decker> see - in that case that cross product is like adding rows to the vector  (as if the vector is a m x 1 matrix).
[06:32:37] <Decker> but, in the case of rotations, rotations beyond 2d affect multiple other values
[06:33:00] <Decker> like x->y,z,w,d5,d5 (just a little)
[06:33:06] <Decker> (d5,d6)

[06:57:49] <ysftaha> somiaj: yeah I just stumbled upon that. I think this would be a decent project

[09:49:01] <redempt1on> Can someone do some math for me? Too stoned. 2 normal payments of 105.67 a month, term is over in June 2023, if this month I start making an extra paymen of 105.67, when does it catch up? 6377.00 remaining blance. IE suppose I were to make 3 payments instead of 2, in which month/year is the balance paid?
[09:52:13] <redempt1on> I suppose interest is a factor, but just need this rough idea
[09:53:44] <Rubba> 6377/(2*105) vs 6377/(3*105) is the number of months you're making payments for
[09:55:54] <redempt1on> Right
[09:56:26] <redempt1on> Something isn't adding up though
[09:56:32] <redempt1on> caue June next year is 3 year mark
[09:56:39] <redempt1on> that formula makes it 20 months
[09:56:50] <redempt1on> when there's only 6 months to it being 24 months
[09:57:28] <redempt1on> I suppose if I paid it off 8 months early, that makes senese
[09:57:35] <redempt1on> 8 x 105 = 840
[09:57:42] <devcpu> Batzy: int-e: guys, in that video, it seems like prof Meyer does not prove that the sqrt(2) is irrational, he proves that any fraction can be expressed in lowest terms

[10:19:56] <Decker> so this is more of a #physics thing, but ... it's also just algebra?
[10:19:57] <Decker>  the time to move 1m at a speed of v is  1/v seconds.  D = 1/v * c ; is how far light goes in that time.  so at a distance of c/v, the apparent center of mass is offset by 1 meter.   For the earth's rotation around the sun it's about 10,000:1.  For the sun's motion around the galaxy (+earth also) is 217-240km/s; which is only like 1249-1380 : 1 ... (or for every 1300m the apparent center of mass is offset by 1m) (right?)

[12:19:22] <Decker> ... https://d3x0r.github.io/STFRPhysics/3d/index6.html  So I was thinking about this sort of spiral path to make a space-filling curve on a sphere; but this turned out to be a Hopf Fibration rotation (or 3 rotations applied to a rotation which the normal to the sphere represents the actual rotation axis...
[12:20:05] <Decker> I think it ends up spending too much time at the poles to be equidistant... but then it also ends up self-intersecting coming back up instead of really covering new space
[12:20:14] <Decker> (sorta failed all around basically)
[12:23:17] <LiaoTao> Is there a notion of space filling curve density, and if so are there curves that are better suited for certain projections?
[12:24:48] <Decker> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve there is somewhat of a density parameter that defines the curve too
[12:25:32] <Decker> well.. certainly - but a sphere isn't a plane with regular bounds

[15:33:27] <qswz> Hi guys, counting the number of digits of an integer is simple with Math.log10, now how could I count the number of digits of a number between 0.1 and 1, 0.1234 for example?
[15:33:55] *** Quits: bitdex (~bitdex@gateway/tor-sasl/bitdex) (Quit: = "")
[15:34:20] <qswz> I want 4 in that case, I'd need to transform 0.1234 to 1234 somehow
[15:35:31] <int-e> Multiply by 10 repeatedly until you get an integer. This may never happen...
[15:35:42] <qswz> int-e: oh indeed, thanks
[15:37:07] <qswz> it'll happen here (floating points number context), thanks again
[15:37:11] <Decker> take a fixed amount based on what you previously had for precision?  and then just .toFixed it ?
[15:37:20] *** Joins: darkapex (~darkapex@user/darkapex)
[15:38:17] <int-e> qswz: Right, for floating point numbers you're in luck because they're fractions of the form n/2^k and when you multiply that by 10^k you get 5^k n which is an integer
[15:38:58] <int-e> though... this is often not useful because the floating point number approximates the value you originally wanted.
[15:40:34] <Decker> I'd figure the case is you end up with fractional parts that make ou keep more digits than you would otherwise keep because of a /prime operation
[15:40:35] <int-e> (say... 1/3 becomes 0.3333333432674407958984375 in 32 bit floats)
[15:41:18] <int-e> So that's 25 decimal digits, but that number has nothing to do with 1/3 anymore.

[16:35:46] <cloudcell> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/CkLR6k5c/image.png

[16:36:40] <cloudcell> in short, I cannot understand what the statement " R^2 x R^2 " means... :(
[16:37:08] <riv> U is a subset of R^2, the upper half plane
[16:37:16] <riv> L is the bottom half plane
[16:37:16] <cloudcell> yes
[16:37:19] <cloudcell> yes
[16:37:23] <riv> so U u L = R^2, the whole plane
[16:37:29] <cloudcell> that's understandable
[16:37:37] <cloudcell> but the  R^2 x R^2  is not
[16:38:03] <riv> I think that we can rewrite  U^2 u L^2 = (U u L)^2
[16:38:19] <riv> if that is valid, then it makes sense that U^2 u L^2 = (R^2)^2
[16:38:38] <cloudcell> hmmm
[16:38:43] <riv> (R^2)^2 = R^2 x R^2 = R^4 -- these are all 4d space

[16:38:56] <cloudcell> yes, that's what is puzzling

[16:40:06] <cloudcell> haha, thanks :)
[16:40:18] <riv> U^2 is the upper half plane squared, so it's like a 4d space that is above the x axis in both ways
[16:40:20] <cloudcell> yeah, now that makes sense

But in either case, (x,y) and (x',y') are both in R x R = R^2, so this thing in V is also in R^2 x R^2

[17:00:05] <Guest59> there is no 'x' term on the RHS and there is on the LHS. Consider u_p = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d. Then -u_xx + u_x = -6ax -2b + 3ax^2 + 2bc + c = x^2

[17:07:45] <Guest59> can i just set d = 0
[17:07:47] <Z-module> savask, I found a neat paper from 1990 with this result, but I'm not sure if it's surprising much, or not.  Let G = S_N = the group of all permutations of a countably infinite set, considered as a group action on N, and thus also as a group action on Pow(N). Obviously two sets A, B in Pow(N) are in the same G-orbit iff |A| = |B| and |A^c| = |B^c|  where ^c denotes complement in N. Call such pairs A,B "good subset pairs". So G is
[17:07:48] <Z-module> "transitive on good subset pairs". The result is that this G has a proper subgroup, still acting on all of Pow(N), that's also transtive on good subset pairs.

[18:23:48] <harwiltz> Hello all. I'm stuck on a problem and I'm essentially completely lost. I have two locally convex spaces X,Y and X is continuously and densely embedded into Y. I want to show that Y' is continuously embedded into X', where the duals are equipped with the weak dual topology. So far, I'm planning on constructing a continuous embedding from a dense subset of Y' taken somehow from the range of the
[18:23:50] <harwiltz> embedding X->Y, and then extending it to Y' with the Hahn-Banach theorem. However I'm not sure how to get any correspondence between the primal and dual spaces...
[18:25:04] <harwiltz> Also I know that since X,Y are locally convex, so are X' and Y' (with the weak dual topology)

[18:27:55] <harwiltz> I guess my biggest issue is that local convexity only assures me that for each nonzero point, there is a seminorm that prescribes it a nonzero value. So I have no clue how to get from an element of Y' to X'.

[18:43:40] <Decker> uhmm no... one's (0) the other's (2pi) but the resulting orientation and applied rotation is 0...
[18:43:53] <Decker> (or near 2pi-e,0+e)
[18:44:51] <Decker> and all points on a 2pi sphere's surface are the same as the origin... and they are non-antipodal with each other
[18:45:26] <Decker> maybe they are; maybe I'm just confusing myself with the definition I think it is vs wht it really is
[18:46:15] <Decker> antipodal is typically considered the 1pi sphere from the origin - where all rotations are 180 from the origin?  Although they can relate with oppositing antipodal points that are the same point
[18:46:21] <Decker> so ya I guess podal doesn't make sense.

[22:41:58] <loller_> when I state the squares as [k/2^n, (k+1)/2^n]^2, they end up not being placed along the line y=x, right?

[23:29:30] <loller_> isekaijin: yeah I think that should work
[23:29:48] <loller_> I just realized my solution doesn't work because the area isn't at all (k+1)*k/(4^n)
[23:29:57] <loller_> I'm not sure where I got (k+1)*k from

[23:58:05] <tomtomgps> I have another complexity question given  \Sigma an alphabet and R \in \Sigma^* \ times \Sigma^* a relation. We define  the follwoing enumation problem. Given x \in \Sigma^*  as input the output is all y \in \Sigma^* such that (x,y) \in R.    An enumaration  algorithlm   A for such a problme gives in finite time for each instance x of the porblem the set of all y solutions.  We define Enum-NP the class of porblems associated to a
[23:58:06] <tomtomgps> relation R such that there exists p and q polynomials such that  if (x,y)  \in R then |y| \leq p(x) and we can verify that (x,y) \in R  with time \leq q(x).   I have to explain why it would not be reasonable to consider the sub class  of Enum NP comprised of problems for which there exists enumeration algorithms with polynomial time bounded by a function of the size of  the input.   I have no idea...
