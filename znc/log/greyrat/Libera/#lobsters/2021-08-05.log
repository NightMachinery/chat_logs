[01:02:35] <JordiGH> lf (emissions from deliveries, since the company doesn't own the delivery company)
[01:02:36] <mockturtle> [ Carbon accounting - Wikipedia ] - en.wikipedia.org
[01:02:52] <technomancy> the ternary operator is a workaround for the bug of forgetting to have removed statements from your language semantics
[01:03:00] <companion_cube> amvc: is it? seems to me like it's basically the same meh imperative language
[01:03:05] <companion_cube> yep
[01:03:30] <JordiGH> Around 2015 or so Google and a bunch of other companies started to whine about how the GHG protocol made them look bad even though they were buying a lot of green energy.
[01:03:44] <JordiGH> Made it look like they were polluting more than they thought they were.
[01:03:45] <maskd> on a related note, my coworker who normally writes OCaml has been forced to write some Python the past few weeks and the other day he was complaining to me that Python's lambda functions are crippled
[01:03:55] <maskd> my answer was basically "deal w/ it"
[01:04:18] <riv> great answer!
[01:04:23] <companion_cube> maskd: I feel for him
[01:04:32] <gerikson> LOL
[01:04:35] <JordiGH> LOL
[01:04:38] <JordiGH> The problem is that you can buy "green electricity" market-based instruments.
[01:05:07] <JordiGH> You pay the power company some extra money and the company promises to use that money to build more solar and wind power plants and whatever else that doesn't produce emissions or produces very little.
[01:05:20] <JordiGH> Google was like, bitch, I wanna say my emissions are coming from solar and wind 'cause I paid for that.
[01:05:40] <JordiGH> WRI and WBCSd retorted, bitch, you're using the same electricity grid as everyone else, your money don't mena shit
[01:06:09] <technomancy> JordiGH: let me guess; Google complained loudly enough and eventually got their way and broke the recording standards so they're now useless?
[01:06:24] <JordiGH> technomancy: Not quite so cynical! But almost.
[01:06:42] <JordiGH> So, the compromise was reached: two different reporting methods.
[01:06:45] <amvc> maskd, companion_cube: Maybe is me getting older and grumpier, but Python 2.x was small and everything fit in together. And I think there is a place for a small, focused language where "there is one, and preferably just one, way to do it". And I believe Python is getting further and further away from that.
[01:07:02] <JordiGH> The traditional method was called "location-based reporting". The new method was called "market-based reporting".
[01:07:35] <companion_cube> amvc: it had mro and metaclasses, so, not so simple
[01:07:47] <companion_cube> (and ofc, terrible strings)
[01:07:48] <technomancy> JordiGH: under capitalism it is difficult to see ghg reporting as meaningfully distinct from medieval catholics selling indulgences
[01:07:52] <JordiGH> Under the old method, you look at how much the entire electricity grid pollutes, you figure out how much of that grid you used during that time, and the corresponding fraction of your usage is how many scope 2 emissions you're responsible for.
[01:08:01] <riv> i used to really hate python
[01:08:16] <riv> it just did so many things wrong
[01:08:18] <JordiGH> technomancy: A somewhat apt comparison but there is a little less theology involved.
[01:09:00] <riv> it was frustrating seeing it get so popular over better languages
[01:09:20] <amvc> companion_cube: agreed on the strings
[01:09:40] <companion_cube> and +1 riv, I find it annoyin
[01:09:41] <JordiGH> With the new method, market-based reporting, if you bought some market-based instruments, you got to say that all of your electricity was coming from the power and solar plants you paid the power company to build and maintain and thus your emissions would be much lower (to keep things fair, under the market-based method if you did NOT buy green energy contracts, you would be penalised and your emissions would be taken solely from dirty sources).
[01:09:49] <companion_cube> and I feel the same about Go becoming popular
[01:09:53] <companion_cube> despite being so… ugh…
[01:10:09] <technomancy> companion_cube: I was biting my tongue despite thinking the exact same thing >_<
[01:10:12] <JordiGH> You're supposed to report both location-based and market-based results.
[01:10:15] <JordiGH> Which, Google does.

[16:24:38] <earthy> epilys: is there a typo in the title of page 9? (The work is beautiful, though I don't much care for the greek font used; it doesn't square with the latin font to my eyes)
[16:25:50] <epilys> earthy, melacholy? it's the author's spelling (english spelling was... peculiar in the 1600s)
[16:26:03] <epilys> the greek font is what comes with the latin font (Junicode)
[16:26:37] <epilys> it's what you'd find in a book back then, had to have a certain aesthetic
[16:26:51] <earthy> yeah, thought that might be, it's just striking that both 'melacholy' and 'melancholy' are used.
[16:27:14] <epilys> maybe I should replace it, I already do some light editing in other parts
[16:27:19] <epilys> thank you
[16:27:32] <earthy> are you trying to go for a somewhat period-accurate look then?
[16:28:04] <epilys> no, just pretty
[16:28:28] <epilys> go to the end of the book at "editor's postface" I include a thumbnail from the first edition
[16:28:31] <epilys> to see what it looked like
[16:28:46] <epilys> it wasn't very readable
[16:30:35] <earthy> p. 1486? the first page and marginalia thumbnails? you can clearly see that the economics of typesetting and printing were different back then. ;)
[16:31:05] <epilys> you'd think the typesetter would pressure the author into having less marginalia :D
[16:31:45] <earthy> those marginalia could well have been post-added to already typeset pages
[16:32:26] <epilys> it's type not hand written, or do you mean something else?
[16:33:41] <earthy> setting a page of type was effort. it almost looks as though blocks of text initially typeset for a particular page size have been re-used in a larger page size while adding marginalia.
[16:34:43] <epilys> ah I see what you mean
[16:34:55] <earthy> (even though it is a first edition, I'd expect there to have been galley proofs that might have prompted the marginalia)
[16:35:23] <mgdm> epilys: that's really great! I'm going to have to poke into how you've done that. The only large amount of typography I've done has been in either Word or CSS, nothing as advanced as that

[18:09:44] <gwozniak> And like Unix or any old system, it just accumulated cruft over the years
[18:10:01] <mgdm> I think fundamentally it takes the C core of XeTeX and has a safe Rust wrapper around it, but beyond that the tooling above is entirely Rust and does things in a more streamlined way
[18:12:30] <epilys> In 1980, Der Spiegel did an article about Don Knuth research (of TeX and The Art of Computer Programming) with the obscure headline "Lieber Butter" (translated as 'Butter preferred') because Knuth once said he refused to eat margarine instead of butter

[18:15:34] <gwozniak> Changing the tooling seems fine to me. Not groundbreaking or anything, but the fact it's in Rust makes no difference to me. Having a system that doesn't prompt you on errors is welcome

[20:46:29] <cb> if your browser respects the system dark theme control...
[20:46:41] <cb> actually i think that commit was reverted

[20:47:56] <archie> cb I use firefox
[20:49:43] <lkhrs> You can toggle light/dark mode using Firefox dev tools
[20:49:52] <cb> iirc it was hard to debug reliably
[20:50:45] <archie> lkhrs how
[20:51:49] <lkhrs> in the Inspector view, at the top of the middle column where you can toggle hover and active states, there's two icons. One looks like a sun for light mode, the other looks like a moon for dark mode

[20:54:05] <lkhrs> if you want to add a dark mode to sites that don't have their own theme, you'll need an addon
[20:54:22] <pushcx> If there's tooling now, might be time to revisit that PR.
[20:55:20] <archie> pushcx glad to hear that!
[20:55:24] <lkhrs> Dark Reader is the addon I used to use
[20:56:35] <archie> lkhrs I know it, however there are glitches on many websites, so I stopped using it. Readability was not that good as well, and anyway I would avoid to install an addon for just one website
[20:56:51] <archie> I'd rather stay with the light theme
[20:57:25] <lkhrs> if darkmode for lobsters is important in the meantime before they add it, maybe you could make your own CSS for it and apply it with Stylus
[20:58:22] <archie> lkhrs Stylus is still an addon, isn't it? I know nothing about CSS (back-end dev)
[20:58:32] <lkhrs> Yes, it is an addon

[23:37:13] <dsc_> fascinating.
[23:39:34] <gwozniak> That's a beefy embedded system
[23:40:34] <dsc_> it is indeed
[23:41:29] <gwozniak> When ram and flash are measured in GB, it's not really all that constraining ;)
[23:42:58] <dsc_> Too bad they are not cheap ;') In addition the free version of Qt does not provide handy tools for working with those embedded boards

[23:43:59] <dsc_> But yeah, if you ever wondered how the instrument cluster in new-ish luxury cars boot so fast ..
[23:44:01] <gwozniak> I think the VM slice I use for my website has less ram than that board. More disk space though. I forget what kind of CPU my VM has.
[23:44:20] <gwozniak> Would they be using that kind of machine?
[23:44:39] <gwozniak> I work with a group making those things and they use much smaller hardware
