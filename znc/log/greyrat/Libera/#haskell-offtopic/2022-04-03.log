[10:42:18] <ongy[m]> https://www8.in.tum.de though they let their certificate expire
[10:48:00] <abastro[m]> Certificate expired.. I am afraid of visiting the site
[10:49:03] <ongy[m]> yea, it's https://net.in.tum.de
[10:49:11] <ongy[m]> that cert is alive and well
[10:49:48] <abastro[m]> Interesting.
[10:50:12] <abastro[m]> Well this makes me wonder, what does "www" at the beginning means?
[10:50:50] <abastro[m]> I think for `in.tum.de`, it follows `de -> tum -> in`. But what is www / net?
[10:51:45] <parsnip> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web#WWW_prefix
[10:52:33] <ongy[m]> it's a convention that kinda died. Technically it's just a hostname, like every other one
[10:53:54] <abastro[m]> Wow, this is an interesting detail I missed!
[10:54:02] <abastro[m]> So.. a hostname. Wow
[10:54:10] <abastro[m]> What a convention
[10:54:36] <abastro[m]> Github also got rid of the convention it seems
[10:54:36] <ongy[m]> There's also https://grnvs.net.in.tum.de/ which is just further down the DNS tree (currently nothing on there, as it's a summer lecture)
[10:56:09] <parsnip> i find it very peculiar if a website still requires www, or automatically redirects to it
[10:56:35] <abastro[m]> Oh right, it seems that some site now uses `m` instead of `www` to designate the site being mobile-directed
[10:56:56] <parsnip> you can have www.m.... or m.www...., iiuc
[10:57:08] <parsnip> slightly orthogonal, i'm guessing
[10:57:23] <ongy[m]> m is mobile for the most part
[10:57:23] <abastro[m]> Whh
[10:57:43] <ongy[m]> I should read full lines probsLUL
[10:57:55] <ongy[m]> argh, I don't have my twitch emotes here haha. /me is too used to discord by now
[10:58:06] <parsnip> maybe websites will redirect to `m.` if they detect small screen, etc
[10:58:40] <abastro[m]> Many local websites still uses `www` lol. Perhaps too lazy to change it
[10:58:52] <parsnip> i'm sending your likeness to a server to add cat ears now
[10:59:10] <ongy[m]> used to be large screen, since the iPhone did some weird hacks to get pages to render the way they wanted them to
[10:59:19] <ongy[m]> but I think these days it's mostly UA
[10:59:43] <parsnip> isn't UA about to be hacked away by some new protocol?
[11:00:55] <abastro[m]> UA?

[11:01:36] <abastro[m]> So even wikipedia has www
[11:02:02] <ongy[m]> chromium team at least suggested to remove UAs. But I don't think it's going anywhere
[11:03:19] <abastro[m]> What is UA?
[11:04:30] <parsnip> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent
