[06:28:12] <Snuupy> xnaas: I still don't know how to reconcile the whole Mozilla+mr robot fiasco
[06:28:39] <xnaas> I can't stand how Chromium browsers render most shit or I'd just use thelounge in an Edge PWA with a plugin to forcefully redirect all clicked links to Firefox
[06:28:48] <xnaas> I do that with Teams for work just b/c that's work and idc
[06:29:56] <xnaas> https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/open-in-firefox/ajgodcbbfnpdbopgmfcgdbfhabbnilbp works but I can't stand how Chromium browsers render images blurry or their large, gaudy video/audio embedded player stuff
[06:30:27] <xnaas> so I only have Edge for a Teams PWA, basically :P
[06:31:03] <Snuupy> what's wrong with chromium rendering?
[06:31:50] <Snuupy> lol teams
[06:34:22] <xnaas> For images specifically, you can see: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=562162
[06:34:34] <xnaas> Firefox doesn't render images blurry as shit and that's fuckin' dope
[06:35:04] <Snuupy> ah interesting
[06:35:14] <xnaas> and for, say https://p.actionsack.com/a/teamspeak.ogg ‚Äî I can't stand how the embed is rendered on any Chromium browser
[06:35:19] <Snuupy> I keep my backgrounds black so I have no idea
[06:35:21] <xnaas> same with videos
[06:35:29] <xnaas> in thelounge
[06:35:37] <xnaas> a previewed image is blurry in chromium
[06:35:39] <xnaas> not in firefox
[06:36:02] <xnaas> (prior to clicking it)
[06:36:55] <Snuupy> ahhh I disabled previews too because I don't like them
[06:37:49] <xnaas> why even use thelounge :P

[06:40:56] <xnaas> At least with something like Vivaldi, you could apply custom CSS and resolve some of the issues like that.
[06:41:04] <xnaas> It'd be a shitload of work...but doable
[06:43:22] <xnaas> Anyway
[06:43:31] <xnaas> despite Mozilla trying their hardest to kill Firefox
[06:43:41] <xnaas> it still does so many little things right
[06:44:01] <xnaas> and every time I use any Chromium browser I'm just like "fuck...back to firefox! üî´"

[06:44:38] <Snuupy> fuck Vivaldi
[06:44:59] <xnaas> Vivaldi is probably the only Chromium browser I'd ever consider daily driving.
[06:45:08] <xnaas> It'll probably come to it eventually, if Mozilla keeps this up...
[06:45:41] <Snuupy> closed source af
[06:46:28] <xnaas> Yeah, it's pretty lame to close source their UI shit
[06:46:54] <xnaas> their reasoning wasn't even good, but it's their product, not mine, so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[06:48:35] <xnaas> I just haven't seen any other Chromium browser worth using.
[06:48:36] <Snuupy> rip
[06:48:46] <Snuupy> I worked at brave and I agree
[06:49:01] <xnaas> They've all got to much bloat in them or spyware stacked on spyware and they're all utterly uncustomizable
[06:49:13] * Snuupy tries to go back to Firefox/librewolf
[06:49:57] <xnaas> Vivaldi is so hardcore on the customization, you can easily remap any browser functionality to any key
[06:50:06] <xnaas> Don't want F5 to reload pages? No problem!
[06:50:29] <xnaas> want find to be ctrl+x because you hate everything good in this world? EASY!
[06:51:35] <xnaas> but yeah, idk what's up with Mozilla ‚Äî I've started to frame every dumb thing they're doing now with the idea that Google is like "do X dumb thing or we're not gonna give you money any more" and it all makes sense. :P
[06:52:09] <xnaas> I should drug up and go to sleep, though. Work in the AM. Good luck with a browser. They're all garbage now. :P

[17:49:39] <xnaas> fair; I'm just bitching about Mozilla :P
[17:49:54] <Snuupy> I literally have 30+ extensions in chrome
[17:50:05] <Snuupy> I wouldn't be using chrome if it weren't for all those extensions/integrations
[17:50:16] <Snuupy> now that I've switched to iceraven on android though I'm starting to prefer firefox more
[17:50:16] <xnaas> Firefox used to have a primitive version of PWAs you could enable via about:config, but they removed it several versions ago. 
[17:50:27] <xnaas> I used it all the time, even if it wasn't great. 
[17:50:32] <Snuupy> I saw it, SSBs
[17:50:38] <xnaas> Yep. 
[17:50:52] <Snuupy> I was talking to an old mozilla engineer, I remember using XULRunner

[17:51:08] <xnaas> Just having a nearly chromeless (chrome as in browser ui) window to keep TL in was great.

[17:56:55] <Snuupy> how annoying
[18:02:17] <xnaas> Yes, the GitHub README explains why. ;P
[18:05:44] <xnaas> When the tool first came out and I tried it, it didn't really work anyway. Plus losing extensions and everything and having to re-configure (and maintain!) another profile just didn't feel worth it. 
[18:05:58] <xnaas> Mozilla should just NOT try to kill off Firefox. :P

[18:16:01] <fnutt> xnaas: It is open source... so..
[18:16:47] <xnaas> Also wonder how Activ8 comes to terms with Edge being a "better one" but also trying to pull shit like https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/edge-is-a-good-browser-but-microsofts-heavy-handed-tactics-make-it-hard-to-love/ (particularly the coupon shit...talk about bloat!)
[18:16:53] <fnutt> But yes, I have made my thoughts about it. However Opera free VPN built-in and the clean browser UI makes up for it. At least for now.
[18:18:20] <xnaas> I also often wonder if Mozilla hadn't fired what's his name for being a homophobe...would he have turned Firefox into crytotrash like Brave?
