[01:07:34] <maroon> FlorianBad, if you have an authentication MAC, i would think the only benefit from an MD5 would be something used by the un-gzip stage to make sure it performs its own job, so the md5/whatever hash could be inside. And since this job is for integrity, you might as well do just the CRC64

[01:12:35] <wasamasa> I dunno, people still use PHP as well
[01:13:24] <FlorianBad> halosghost, wasamasa: only reason I use it is because it's on every system on earth, including non-linux, like for example some file storage tools at a hosting company or something like that, so I don't have to download 100GB just to verify some data (in case that's ever needed)
[01:13:35] <wasamasa> so is sha2
[01:13:41] <maroon> most of the md5 i see is just using it as if it's a slow crc-128
[01:13:45] <wasamasa> yes
[01:14:08] <halosghost> sha256sum is… pretty widely available
[01:14:15] <wasamasa> if you actually need to use a checksum, crc32 is a thing

[01:14:30] <FlorianBad> ok
[01:15:07] <wasamasa> MD5 exists since 1992, SHA2 since 2001
[01:15:16] <wasamasa> I really hope your OS is newer than windows 93
[01:15:38] <maroon> crc32 is trivial to change if you have 4 consecutive bytes that you can edit: /ctcp maroon crc deadbeef baddcode

[05:49:55] <FlorianBad> ms7821: I don't understand where that's supposed to come from, is it something generated after encryption or something that I'm supposed to have?
[05:50:41] <ms7821> it's a mac
[05:51:05] <ms7821> similar to a signature, it's used to verify your 
[05:51:12] <ms7821> message's integrity
[05:52:19] <ms7821> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code
[05:52:25] <Alipha> Ugh. This isn't constant time. That's bad: die "decrypt failed" unless $tag eq $expected_tag;
[05:53:19] <ms7821> I mean it's perl, anyone using it is cursed already
[05:55:15] <Alipha> FlorianBad: so, in the functional example interface, chacha20poly1305_encrypt_authenticate produces the $ciphertext and $tag. Store both of those (Put the tag in your file header or whatever). Then when you decrypt, pull the tag out of your file header and pass it to chacha20poly1305_decrypt_verify as shown
[05:58:41] <FlorianBad> ok I see, so in a way it's like a checksum and it's safe to make it public?
[05:59:54] <Alipha> FlorianBad: yes. It's a checksum that's cryptographically secure and cannot be spoofed. Unlike crc or (unkeyed) md5
[06:00:47] <maroon> sometimes mac's can be like a signature that shows they were created only by the other guy, but sometimes they can be created only by people who know the shared key
[06:01:41] <FlorianBad> ok. The only thing is, you get it once you wrote your 100GB of encrypted data file output;)   So that means the exact (or sufficient) number of bytes should be left free in the headers to keep that organized, ortherwise I'm forced to write that at the end
[06:10:07] <maroon> the mac should authenticate everything else in the header, not just the ciphertext - it needs to authenticate everything else that needs to be defended against tampering
[06:27:10] <SlimmyJimmy> ms7821 Yes, webtorrent I guess, I'm not familiar with it.
[06:27:39] <SlimmyJimmy> I expected it to launch my local client and it just shows its downloading in the webpage. And I'm like, what the hell, where is it saving it, my browser doesn't even show it in the downloads.
