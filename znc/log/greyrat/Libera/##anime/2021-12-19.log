[00:31:41] <MootPoot> all the frontals are 1g
[00:31:58] <Bco1981> yeah... but what do you need 10gig for ?? :D
[00:32:00] <MootPoot> on ebay they are all for like ~100 bucks
[00:32:02] <MootPoot> Bco1981: idk 
[00:32:10] <MootPoot> its there so...
[00:32:23] <MootPoot> I could multiplex 1gig ones
[00:32:43] <MootPoot> lol have 10 cat5e cables going to my nas box
[00:32:49] <Bco1981> if the module was there, and then you need a sfp+ optic
[00:33:11] <Bco1981> you need a 2nd switch at the other end to make multiple ports to 1
[00:33:37] <Bco1981> i guess that's cheaper, then getting the 10gig modules
[00:33:40] <MootPoot> there are options it seems like based on the website

[00:34:20] <MootPoot> is that like sfp+
[00:34:29] <Bco1981> those are usually more expensive then a sfp+ plug
[00:35:39] <Bco1981> it would be cheaper and go with a 2nd switch and 8 ethernet cables
[00:35:47] <Bco1981> there are enough ports
[00:36:26] <Bco1981> using port 41-48 on both
[00:36:54] <MootPoot> amusingly I got this one for cheaper then a real one lol
[00:37:08] <MootPoot> a new consumer managed switch cost like 40 bucks
[00:37:12] <MootPoot> 8port 1gig
[00:37:16] <MootPoot> this was 10 bucks
[00:40:50] <MootPoot> from what I can piece together, it seems like my network's slowest link cant get any faster then 2gbit or so
[00:41:54] <MootPoot> so I just need 2 of them for it to work
[00:42:26] <Bco1981> as long as it's more then 1gibt. because 1 pc/device can use 1gbit. so any "carrying" link will get saturated.
[00:43:23] <MootPoot> basically it goes like pc->MoCa (2gbit max ) -> dell switch -> server and NAS

[01:31:56] <Bco1981> depends on what it's standard config is, but probably
[01:32:54] <Bco1981> if it does not have an ip adress, or is setup to use dhcp for vlan 1. then you won't be able to telnet to it.

[02:00:13] <omero> also, typing all those silly characters would be a pain on my keyboard :P
[02:00:41] <HeTo> echo is your friend but note that if the value of the variable might start with a dash you should make sure the variable doesn't come first, so something like echo "value: $variable", or alternatively, use printf: printf '%s\n' "$variable"
[02:00:54] <omero> like √ßa
[02:01:47] <omero> yeah, well... each shell has his methods
[02:01:59] <omero> peculiarities...
[02:02:38] <omero> I sort of assumed that Satin was using bash
[02:03:01] <Satin> they're p similiar i think
[02:03:10] <omero> for long time I was using exclusively csh
[02:03:34] <omero> bash is bash.
[02:04:07] <omero> all shells are somewhat different, hence their different names
[02:04:30] <HeTo> Satin: anyway, you should really go to a library and pick a good Unix book. one that is older than you is just fine, it's not like the basics have changed that much
[02:04:32] <omero> bash and ash are similar

[02:05:10] <HeTo> I remember this one book I read. back when it was written I think Linux was version 1.something and its mascot was a horse

[02:15:25] <ButterNoodle> wut
[02:15:31] <Satin> yes
[02:15:32] <ButterNoodle> never used tmux?
[02:15:33] <omero> I prefer screen
[02:15:41] <ButterNoodle> 2 different use cases
[02:15:43] <Satin> ButterNoodle: there simply isn't any need to if ur a noob
[02:15:45] <ButterNoodle> I use both
[02:15:52] <Satin> i don't do servers or anything
[02:15:55] <omero> but combining screen and tmux can be surprisingly good experience
[02:16:02] <ButterNoodle> I use both
[02:16:08] <ButterNoodle> I park stuff in screen
[02:16:08] <Satin> looking up screen
[02:16:09] <omero> ButterNoodle: :D
[02:16:13] <ButterNoodle> run stuff in tmux
[02:16:17] <omero> yes
[02:16:22] <omero> like a pro ;)
[02:16:32] <Satin> interesting.
[02:16:47] <ButterNoodle> Satin: u start a screen session and run stuff in it.. then u can detach and return later
[02:16:52] <omero> its the power of unix, baby
[02:17:00] <ButterNoodle> I run some long backups in screen co I can check on them later
[02:17:10] <Satin> deatch?
[02:17:13] <omero> yes
[02:17:14] <Satin> is this in a context of servers
[02:17:17] <ButterNoodle> also.. all my irssi sessions are in screen
[02:17:21] <Satin> cuz i don't see how that can happen on a local machine?
[02:17:22] <ButterNoodle> naaa
[02:17:25] <omero> you can do stuff 
[02:17:33] <Satin> wait you can literally pause stuff in time
[02:17:38] <Satin> or something
[02:17:40] <ButterNoodle> detach from the psudoterminal in screen and do other things
[02:17:44] <ButterNoodle> like start more screens
[02:17:47] <ButterNoodle> naa
[02:17:48] <omero> like ... even on the same system
[02:17:51] <ButterNoodle> it doesnt pause
[02:17:55] <vegii> is gura really senzawa?
[02:17:58] <ButterNoodle> thats backgrounding
[02:18:10] <ButterNoodle> screen is like vnc
[02:18:14] <ButterNoodle> but for text only
[02:18:15] <Nanobot> I have a pen. I have an asshole. Uh! Asshole pen.
[02:18:26] <omero> yes... and not many understand that one can have several X11 running at once
[02:18:29] <omero> to test stuff
[02:18:31] <ButterNoodle> Nanobot: what about pen pen asshole?
[02:18:35] <ButterNoodle> to tight?
[02:19:00] <ButterNoodle> I think on my irc vm there are a dozen screens running
[02:19:00] <Nanobot> Pen pain asshole asshole pen
[02:19:14] <ButterNoodle> each to a different irssi and config
[02:19:27] <ButterNoodle> just screen -r butter-libera
[02:19:31] <ButterNoodle> just screen -r butter-rizon
[02:19:33] <ButterNoodle> etc
[02:19:35] <Nanobot> vegii: No. Gura is a shark. Senzawa isn't a shark. Obviously completely different.
[02:19:39] <ButterNoodle> crtl+a d
[02:19:42] <ButterNoodle> to detatch
[02:19:48] <omero> screen allows one to start a process in one terminal, then you switch X11 session and can resume your process there, seamlessly...
[02:19:52] <ButterNoodle> tbh I'm not as good w tmux
[02:20:08] <ButterNoodle> I've used screen for 25 years tho
[02:20:21] <ButterNoodle> maybe 20 years.. idk
[02:20:32] <omero> I cant ditch it yet...
[02:20:41] <ButterNoodle> tmux.. I just know how to navigate panes and close shit
[02:20:42] <omero> old habits die hard, ButterNoodle :P
[02:20:51] <ButterNoodle> yea
[02:21:11] <Nanobot> Old hobbits die hard. Just look at Bilbo.
[02:21:14] <ButterNoodle> I just have a bash script that sets up my tmux when I launch it
[02:21:27] <omero> besides... if it aint broken... why upgrade?
[02:21:44] <Nanobot> Roboco just discovered that Amelia lives with Roboco's mom.
[02:21:47] <ButterNoodle> hard to upgrade when no better solutions exist
[02:21:52] <omero> screen just works for me(tm)
[02:22:14] <Satin> can you open a tmux in a tmux
[02:22:40] <omero> mmm
[02:22:47] <ButterNoodle> probably
[02:22:51] <Satin> lol
[02:22:52] <omero> why would you do such, Satin ?
[02:22:58] <Satin> just wondering
[02:23:04] <Satin> in case i accidentally do that idk
[02:23:05] <ButterNoodle> I have opened vnc inside vnc
[02:23:07] <omero> screen + tmux makes sense
[02:23:34] <omero> screen + screen? you're asking for troubles
[02:23:59] <ButterNoodle> tmux + screen is gud too
[02:24:00] <omero> but theoretically possible. I assume tmux + tmux is same situation
[02:24:25] <Satin> what's the point of deattaching/attaching
[02:24:28] <Satin> what's the advantages here
[02:24:31] <omero> ButterNoodle: yes. but ... depends on use-case
[02:24:37] <Satin> like a save session of sorts?
[02:24:45] <omero> practical example?
[02:24:47] <Satin> yeah
[02:24:51] <Satin> can you restart your computer
[02:24:55] <Satin> and the re-attach to that session
[02:25:00] <ButterNoodle> naa
[02:25:01] <omero> you have a system with this uptime
[02:25:03] <ButterNoodle> when the pid dies
[02:25:05] <ButterNoodle> it dies
[02:25:12] <omero>  23:44:22 up 24 days,  2:53,  3 users,  load average: 0.10, 0.11, 0.04

[02:29:47] <vegii> ...on average
[02:29:51] <Satin> i guess i'm only using tmux for the ability to multiplex windows or whatever the term is
[02:29:57] <Bco1981> you need to fix those servers

[11:01:34] <Satin> and microsoft and big tech know how to embrace open source in tainting fashion
[11:01:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Windows & Linux on desktop are pretty much doomed to failure as serious options in the long run anyway.
[11:01:45] <Satin> what?
[11:01:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They're fundamentally based around an architecture that doesn't properly do separation and which is ripe with ambient authority.

[11:02:28] <Satin> what's "separation"
[11:02:30] <Satin> is this a technical term
[11:02:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: MacOS is also shit, but it's also not a serious option to start with due to it being richfag bullshit.

[11:04:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: Yes, and how long will it be sustainable as the budgets for cyberweapons increase?
[11:04:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: seL4, Qubes
[11:04:39] <Satin> so the perspective you have, is that this is a trainwreck because in the long term security wise they'll collapse
[11:04:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yes.
[11:05:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They're fucked unless they change their whole architecture, which won't happen.
[11:05:03] <Satin> and my kneejerck reaction to this (because I haven't contemplated this stuff before) is that you're underestimating the development of such platforms and the future responses they'll have
[11:05:28] <Satin> they could add security layers (i don't know what i'm saying), or whatever to bullshit their way around the issue in the longterm?
[11:05:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The only response that would actually deal with the problem is one that basically requires a rewrite from scratch.
[11:05:37] <Satin> they have lots of money and dev time to come up with those solutions
[11:05:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: It's a design-level problem.
[11:05:55] <Satin> I see.
[11:06:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The design is bad and can't be fixed without changing it.
[11:06:28] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: why are new OSs not being developed
[11:06:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The closest to working around it they could do is like Qubes does, which is use their main OS as guest OSes on top of a secure microkernel used as a VM host.
[11:06:52] <MootPoot> Idk - I don't think windows will be around here forever

[11:18:59] <senti> ButterNoodle remember that time we all video chatted. I hope I wasn't too drunk
[11:19:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So the fact that TCP scheduling & congestion algorithms have improved is not something they care to know.

[11:20:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: I think it's too pessimistic. It's a bit like claiming cars are seeing no innovation because everyone prefers to drive cheap crumbling ladas than expensive new stuff.

[11:33:29] <MootPoot> Satin: okay - my bad , I misread there. But I still wonder why you think WSL is targetted at linux users instead of macOS - or is that just a perspective thing - they may have targetted macOS , but it might do some damage to linux in the process, and thats why you're mad?
[11:33:44] <ButterNoodle> wow
[11:33:47] <ButterNoodle> I like this
[11:33:52] <Berlin36> what
[11:34:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Basically, CSP, coroutines & memory safety are what Golang does better than C.
[11:34:08] <Berlin36> another buttplug? ButterNoodle 
[11:34:19] <Satin> MootPoot: first mistake is being hung up on my point about WSL specifically. I'd say the same thing even if WSL didn't happen.
[11:34:21] <ButterNoodle> but the thought of sneaking into kids rooms with a girl dressed as santa sounds pretty criminal
[11:34:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's also basically replacing C in the field of small utils & programs.
[11:34:41] <ButterNoodle> idk if thats ok in japan..
[11:34:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For system programming it ain't because Rust & C are more suited to that. 
[11:35:15] <Satin> MootPoot: secondly it's hard for me to convey what I'm saying to you partly because you don't seem to have background on "free software" philosophy and how it criticizes/critiques properitiery software. I don't know how much you know about Richard Stallman. I don't know how much you know about Microsoft's war on Linux/open source for years till very recently, etc.
[11:35:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> While I'd like if it were Common Lisp, if Golang it is, then I'll take it. Anything over using something as unsafe as C as a default language for everything...
[11:35:51] <MootPoot> I know about the whole EEE thing, people were spamming that back in my Ubuntu days as well.

[11:37:51] <newbie2021> Satin: damn right you are. U gotta respect yourself
[11:38:08] <Satin> MootPoot: But no. Richard Stallman strongly is against "FOSS," he identifies with the "free software camp"
[11:38:27] <Satin> There is Libre/Free Software people, and then there are the FOSS people. 
[11:38:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There was a time around 00s when research in kernel-level stuff slowed down.
[11:38:51] <newbie2021> Satin: His boss doesn't respect him. He is a slave on his job. His boss treats him like garbage
[11:38:54] <Satin> Two distinct camps that emerged. The OSI (Open Source Incentive) happened and they were willing to have sex with corporate companies and properitiery stuff
[11:38:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Incidentally the wave of malware everywhere that XP brought gave some new life to secure systems research
[11:38:58] <Satin> which stallman didn't like
[11:39:18] <Satin> so you see, Linus Torvlards and a bunch of other open source/FOSS advocates are fine with propiertiry stuff and intergration
[11:39:23] <Satin> the FSF people are not
[11:39:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Eh, to a degree.
[11:39:41] <Satin> they don't outright hate each other, but it is a difference that exists. there is a lot of overlap
[11:39:50] <ButterNoodle> nuff with that boy shit..
[11:40:05] <Satin> growing up i watched FOSS games/software/communities have people that were at least...very respectful and desireous of FSF ideals
[11:40:13] <newbie2021> So guys, spyware is everywhere. It is even in our computers. You can't get away from that. We are in a prison. Soon it will be worse. A lot worse.

[18:07:41] <omero> Im a bit confused... you want to use dhcp? that should fix your nic address just fine.
[18:07:51] <Bco1981> no i want a static

[18:08:17] <omero> that is your problem
[18:08:23] <Bco1981> i am reserving the address in the dhcp so OTHER host won't get that ip
[18:08:43] <omero> you want to get a dynamically assigned ip, with a netmask ... that wouldnt make sense
[18:09:03] <omero> ohhhh... no, that's not how you do that!

[18:24:25] <Satin> i just ooened a can of sparkling water and drank it too quickly i guess and basically was in pain for 3 minutes while i groaned over the sink
[18:24:33] <HeTo> although if you don't need Network Manager for anything like wlan, I would still uninstall it to make sure it isn't messing up with the interface at first before setting it to unmanaged but after ifup has set it up

[18:28:34] <omero> what I am still not understanding... is why you want to change the netmask
[18:29:35] <omero> in other words, Bco1981 ... the netmask just sets your nic address space
[18:29:43] <Bco1981> omero: i know that
[18:29:44] <omero> it is essentially a border

[18:30:00] <omero> Im trying to understand
[18:30:12] <Bco1981> i know what a netmask does, and i need to change it.
[18:30:18] <listen_ers> is that debian in particular or raspbian
[18:30:27] <Bco1981> *and that is why* i need to change it

[18:30:40] <zoidberg> omero: Bco works in a networking company

[19:16:03] <Bco1981> listen_ers: the smart thing about having the dhcp leases control it, is that you also have a very good view of what is used in your network. you don't need a seperate place for documenting that.

[20:03:41] <JesseDesu__> whats the difference between a hard and soft link 
[20:04:08] <Bco1981> don't know what a hard link is.
[20:04:13] <omero> the hardlink will exist untill the last copy is removed
[20:04:26] <omero> the symlink its just a pointer to a file
[20:04:34] <JesseDesu__> what does that mean
[20:04:41] <Bco1981> file/folder
[20:04:44] <Terminus> also hard links must be on the same filesystem. symlinks can cross filesystems.
[20:04:54] <JesseDesu__> oh neat
[20:04:57] <omero> in other words, you can hardlink a file, and its essentially a physical file
[20:05:18] <JesseDesu__> omero i dont get it
[20:05:42] <omero> a symlink to a file is a reference to a file
[20:05:47] <JesseDesu__> it says to use softlinks if you arent sure

[20:06:30] <JesseDesu__> i want to turn my ~/home/Pictures and ~/home/Downloads into a symlink on my external hdd to save space
[20:06:52] <Terminus> the 1 before the username is the number of hard references you have to the file. in this case, it's 1 because there's only one reference to it: the file itself.
[20:06:52] <JesseDesu__> does that work

[20:18:44] <Terminus> omero: -x only applies to not crossing filesystem boundaries on the source. the destination is irrelevant.
[20:19:29] <omero> you mean the mountpoint
[20:19:45] <Terminus> so if /mnt/foo/ and /mnt/foo/bar/ are two different filesystems, rsync -ax /mnt/foo/ ... will not copy /mnt/foo/bar/

[23:37:26] <omero> Terminus: read good things about nftables. I am unready tho... 
[23:40:55] <Terminus> omero: if you're very familiar with iptables, it's not too much trouble switching to nftables. the biggest difference for me i think is the multiple tables part and hook priorities.
[23:41:31] <omero> yeah, Im quite familiar with iptables :P
[23:41:58] <omero> its more complicated when you run your own system with its own kernel... 
[23:42:30] <Terminus> instead of having the predefined input chain for example, you hook into input instead and the order in which all the tables get processed depends on the priority.
[23:43:06] <omero> I kind of like that concept
[23:43:41] <omero> when things are done properly, it totally makes sense infact
[23:43:53] <omero> its very... efficient
[23:44:36] <Terminus> install centos and do `nft list ruleset` and you'll get a bit to read because there's a bunch of predefined tables and chains. XD
[23:44:50] <omero> NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN
[23:45:05] <omero> lol
[23:45:58] <Terminus> i mentioned nftables to a friend and he was like "next you're gonna fall down the ebpf rabbit hole. üòÇ
[23:46:10] <omero> hihihi
[23:46:30] <omero> I do like that concept in principle... 
[23:47:13] <Terminus> i just need a firewall and since nftables is the way of the future, it was time for me to switch to it.
[23:47:30] <omero> I understand that clearly.
[23:47:52] <Terminus> the motivation really being RHEL makes heavy use of it and raspbian dropped installing iptables by default.
[23:48:09] <omero> Im still shell shock by transitioning from ipchains to iptables...
[23:48:40] <Terminus> i expect bullseye in general doesn't install iptables by default anymore but i haven't tried installing debian. i spend most of my time in RHEL land.
[23:50:02] <omero> when you have to quickly deploy things based on a mainstream 'distro'... that makes sense Terminus
