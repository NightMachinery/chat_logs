[00:03:54] <JordiGH> I recently took a kid to get the vaccine. He got a diploma for bravery for taking the vaccine.
[00:03:58] <JordiGH> I could get you a diploma too, hackers.
[00:04:05] <junebug> It's not about you though. We get vaccinated so we don't infect the people who are too weak to get vaccinated like the elderly
[00:04:12] <hackers> you can trasmit covid even if you're vaccinated so you're not afraid of people that are vaccinated?

[02:34:26] <xaltsc> propertize doesn't apply properties to empty strings, that's why I had to add the ZWS there, before laying down the actual contents of the modeline
[02:35:21] <pjb> But if the  zero-width-space character is not there, it won't take a pixel.
[02:36:54] <xaltsc> Yeah, but then my mode-line would not be wide enough
[02:37:15] <pjb> That's the other thing. mode-lines are always as wide as the frame.  How wider can it be?
[02:37:25] <pjb> or the window at least.
[02:37:43] <xaltsc> It meant wide in the vertical direction
[02:38:30] <xaltsc> It's like adjusting line-height (except it doesn't work) or setting a padding to top and/or bottom
[02:38:34] <pjb> So "high".

[06:16:30] <GNUHacker> nice, i run ffplay frm an emacs function
[06:16:53] <kjani> That is definitely something that a GNUHacker would say
[06:17:00] <GNUHacker> also cvlc (vlc CLI)
[06:17:29] <kjani> Theme ?? because the default one looks too hight contrast for me
[06:17:46] <GNUHacker> vlc.el is an interface to cvlc

[06:39:13] <rpav> there's not that much difference really, aside from the terminal just being worse in every regard
[06:41:44] <aidalgol> I've been a regular here for well over a decade now, and this idea that the terminal is cooler than the GUI is perhaps the one constant.
[06:42:05] <zebrag> With `visual-line-mode` and the string `* xxx/xxxx-xxx/xx` with say 100 of xs, you end up with an unnecessarily ugly result. It is a known issue, sort of, already discussed about back in 2009, and I don't want to add more fuss. But I'd really like to find a way to hack it, for it to have a way prettier result in that specific case which really occurs very often with `org-mode`. I've read `simple.el`, but I didn't find any angle.
[06:42:18] <zebrag> so if anyone is elisp savy
[06:43:29] *** Quits: abrantesasf (~abrantesa@187.36.170.211) (Remote host closed the connection)

[06:45:09] <bpalmer> anybody who isn't using one, why are you putting up with non-permanent technology?

[06:47:01] <grym> i mean, i spend a lot of time in a terminal, but i also use gui emacs

[06:54:14] <bpalmer> yes.
[06:54:38] <umaxtu> I didn't realize that was actually related to the original. huh
[06:55:33] <bpalmer> it probably wasn't, until they realized they could get the name to get a handful more viewers.
[06:55:57] <bpalmer> in the same way Die Hard 2 was originally completely unrelated to Die Hard, but then a producer had an idea...
[06:56:19] <umaxtu> Die Hard 2 turned out alright
[06:57:01] <bpalmer> I actually like it slightly more than Die Hard 1
[06:57:17] <bpalmer> although that may be because I saw 2 first.
[06:57:31] <hodapp> what's this about Saw 2?

[06:59:32] <bpalmer> oh, that's good to know: 'his film originally came from a script by the director Darren Lynn Bousman which was called "The Desperate". After trying for years to get it made but being told repeatedly that it was too violent, a company finally wanted to do it because they suspected Saw (2004) (which was becoming a hit at Sundance) might be a huge success'

[08:58:40] <t2mkn> hello all. I just came to know about emac and have decided to learn. i have MBP. i see lots of varients of emacs in youtube videos. tried `brew install emacs`. but here Meta key is `esc` key. is there any other emacs which is suitable for me. 
[08:58:58] <t2mkn> coming from vim though.

[08:59:20] <johnjay> what
[08:59:55] <johnjay> all the emacs versions i tried on macos the option key was meta
[09:00:02] <johnjay> esc is a backup
[09:00:38] <t2mkn> for me option key not acting like Meta !
[09:01:47] <causative> to do M-x you need to hold the option key down as you press x, then release both
[09:03:33] <johnjay> i want to recommend https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus
[09:03:45] <johnjay> but i can't exactly define how it is different from brew's default emacs
[09:03:54] <causative> just a guess at what the problem might be, if esc is working but not the option key - because to do M-x with esc you can press and release esc, but option key works differently

[09:04:16] <t2mkn> if i press `option` and hold it, then press any char, it is typing some other chars. like if i press `option`+v it prints ~

[09:04:48] <johnjay> so regular emacs doesnt' use cocoa? but how does it do GUI on macos then?
[09:05:16] <johnjay> oh that
[09:05:29] <johnjay> you need to go to Terminal settings and check a box to make option act as meta
[09:05:39] <johnjay> but that's not specific to emacs it's the terminal doing it

[17:22:20] <contrapunctus> thblt: cheers :)
[17:22:29] <contrapunctus> So...Elisp question. In an "extended" CLOS protocol (one where some operations are implemented in terms of others; as opposed to "minimalist", where no operation can be implemented in terms of another), does one perform precondition checks in extended operations as well? In exceptional situations it would throw errors sooner, but in normal execution it would mean repetitive error checking... 🤔️
[17:22:57] <thblt> contrapunctus: it sits below the keyboard layouts, right? It still outputs scancodes to be translated?
[17:24:01] <contrapunctus> thblt: I believe it does. It even works in the virtual terminal (?)...but for some reason switching to Devanagari in iBus makes my keyboard go nuts, requiring a restart of kmonad...

[17:37:24] <thblt> My ERC doesn't send notifications. Either it still connects to a notification service just in case, or you have a case of Configuration.
[17:37:58] <s-liao> But dbus mostly in Linux.
[17:38:15] <thblt> Wait there's a "lisp/notifications.el" in the emacs source.
[17:39:12] <wgreenhouse> erc has stuff you can configure (optional module) to use dbus for desktop notifications. I think gnus and org and others do as well
[17:39:19] <wgreenhouse> nobody does it by default, though
