[03:30:07] <jaggz> osse, what version of vim are you using?
[03:31:28] <jaggz> it looks to me like they're not handling the termination of the indented heredoc anyway. their syntax end is: end=+$+

[03:37:41] <jaggz> (debian stable system == old packages)
[03:37:47] <jaggz> end=+^\s*\z1$+
[03:38:20] <jaggz> that fixes it enough for me, although it doesn't handle the string inside properly (parsing it as what seems to be perl).. but so far it doesn't matter.

[06:48:54] <nova> I don't want the feds knocking on my door. "FBI. OPEN UP."
[06:48:54] <jaggz> nova, while not intriguing, I use straight debian.  went from slackware to redhat to ubuntu to debian and stayed.
[06:49:15] <nova> I heard about debian ... whatever it's called. sid? The unstable one?
[06:49:24] <jaggz> I don't recommend it.  a trustable debian-based distro might be nice
[06:49:34] <nickspoon> I've become a bit addicted to rolling releases.
[06:49:43] <nova> I can't stand stable debian.
[06:49:52] <jaggz> the reason I don't recommend it is because stable is too old, and there aren't enough backports for stuff, and 'testing' is too broken.
[06:50:19] <jaggz> Amazon Linux or whatever it's called?  ;)
[06:50:24] <jaggz> how's arch?
[06:50:43] <nova> Ah yes. I use "Google Amazon Facebook Tesla linux"
[06:50:48] <nova> It doesn't send any telemetry anywhere
[06:50:50] <codebam> nixos is more configuration based, but silverblue is similar in how it has atomic updates
[06:51:01] <codebam> you can rebase your system sort of like git
[06:51:21] <jaggz> One of my issues is that, when I set up my system, I don't like messing with it.. I'll use that system for years and years and years.. I'm not organized enough with my data and stuff to smoothly migrate to another distro 
[06:51:48] <jaggz> which means I'm stuck with what I put on my personal computer sort of until I set up a new computer :)
[06:51:52] <nova> tbh nixos' "recompiling" for installing packages seems annoying. is that just for system-wide packages (not user packages)?
[06:51:57] <codebam> jaggz: on silverblue when you want to upgrade to the latest release you can just rebase and if something breaks you can downgrade
[06:52:13] <jaggz> speaking of reading, and environment, and the 9/08 date thing up there and stuff.. I went and read some of the Qur'an verses
[06:52:25] * jaggz looks shifty-eyed
[06:52:35] <nova> silverblue is pretty interesting
[06:52:36] <codebam> I just use a toolbox for a different environment on fedora silverblue. I have one for fedora and one for arch
[06:53:13] <codebam> you can install graphical packages inside them too. they're podman containers with proper bind mounts so that wayland and xorg work
[06:53:20] <jaggz> recompiling was slackware style.. way too slow to bother with
[06:53:26] <nova> does silverblue only come with gnome, though?
[06:53:54] <codebam> nova: right now yes, next release has official kinoite. you can rebase onto kinoite right now, it's just not official just yet
