[00:08:41] <Xe> i hate dealing with normies
[00:08:54] <Xe> today in my hell, arguing with a journalist about what my name is
[00:17:12] <indigo> That sucks :( and then after the article comes out, you realize that they semi-got the gist of whatever they were reporting on but the details aren't quite right
[00:18:32] <Brekkjern> God damn. Using Resolve is more pain than just doing this in ffmpeg
[00:18:34] <Brekkjern> Holy shit...
[00:20:19] <imode> your name is Xe.
[00:20:40] <imode> what's hard about that.
[00:21:15] <Xe> imode: "The problem is one of attribution. Xe isn't an uncommon name - the Blackwater mercenary group changed its name to Xe after the Nisour Square massacre for example, although it's since tried another rebrand. The Canadian financial exchange Xe also operates under the same name and we felt it important to avoid confusion and establish your bona fides clearly."
[00:22:09] <imode> cool. your name is Xe.
[00:22:27] <imode> companies do not get to steal names.
[00:22:39] <imode> if the journalist doesn't get that, it's not a conversation worth having.
[00:28:39] <Brekkjern> Argh! Why is media editing such a shitshow? :(
[00:30:04] <manicennui> Because you are trying to use open source to do it?
[00:30:10] <imode> foos
[00:31:56] <riv> grass is not (much) greener on the other side unfortunately
[00:32:20] <Xe> Brekkjern: do you want to know how i came to video editing nirvana?
[00:32:27] <Xe> i use imovie on an ipad
[00:32:43] <Brekkjern> I think getting an ipad for this is a bit too much
[00:32:47] <Brekkjern> Also the input file is 4k
[00:32:56] <Xe> the ipad is no fucking slouch
[00:33:03] <companion_cube> Xe: have you shown the journalist your libera.chat credentials?
[00:33:07] <Brekkjern> HAH! SUCCESS!
[00:33:08] <companion_cube> that's as good an ID as it gets
[00:33:16] <Brekkjern> Also, my poor CPU :S
[00:33:17] <Xe> the m1 ipad pro is as beefy as a macbook air lol
[00:33:42] <Brekkjern> ARGH! Now it doesn't detect the fucking audio?! WTF?!
[00:40:53] <Brekkjern> Kill me...
[00:52:49] <Brekkjern> Well. It seems that Resolve has no support for ac3 audio in mkv files
[00:52:54] <Brekkjern> For some reason

[01:30:21] <indigo> Excuse me, but it seems like you mentioned a SaaS, centralized chat system. Are you an enemy of FOSS?
[01:39:04] <skyl4rk> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as SaaS is in fact, Capitalism/SaaS, or as I've recently taken to calling it, Capitalism plus SaaS. SaaS is not a service delivery method unto itsellf, but rather another free market component ofa fully dysfunctional Capitalist society etc. and so on...

[01:42:09] <companion_cube> I can paste a gemini link to your faux pas

[01:45:07] <indigo> Brekkjern: I'm glad your grief was Resolved in the end
[01:45:12] <skyl4rk> pretty neat
[01:47:11] <Brekkjern> indigo: Audio still doesn't work though...
[01:48:24] * manicennui lends Brekkjern a Mac
[01:48:47] <indigo> Brekkjern: I guess you could try demuxing it, transcoding the audio to WAV...
[01:48:47] <Brekkjern> manicennui: I'd probably have to pay for the editing software at that point though :P
[01:48:59] <Brekkjern> indigo: Yeah, but... effort :P
[01:49:33] <Brekkjern> The original audio is ac3 5.1
[01:49:45] <skyl4rk> I remember cutting and processing video with cinelerra. It was *very* picky with its formats
[01:49:51] <indigo> > Improved decode performance for MKV clips with AAC and AC3 audio.
[01:49:56] <Brekkjern> Speaking of, I should get rear speakers for my home cinema...
[01:50:00] <indigo> Lies, DaVinci Resolve doesn't support AC3 audio
[01:50:05] <skyl4rk> but it was the only one that I could run at any sort of performance at the time
[01:50:13] <Brekkjern> indigo: It's not working on my machine :S
[01:50:18] <skyl4rk> and it had some really neat features
[01:50:49] <Brekkjern> This is the audio stream according to ffmpeg: Stream #0:1(eng): Audio: eac3 (ec-3 / 0x332D6365), 48000 Hz, 5.1(side), fltp, 640 kb/s (original)
[01:55:50] * Xe stabs Brekkjern gently with a taco
[01:56:08] <Brekkjern> Xe: Hard or soft shell?
[01:56:15] <Xe> yes
[01:57:20] <drakonis> Xe: how do you feel about guix but rewritten in a different lisp and free of any gnu associations?
[01:57:24] <drakonis> also very flexible
[01:57:36] <companion_cube> like, fennel ? :p
[01:57:49] <Xe> drakonis: at that point why not just make nix better lol
[01:57:49] <drakonis> idk
[01:57:50] <manicennui> If it has a hard shell it isn't a taco.
[01:57:58] <drakonis> cube rules, babyyyyyy
[01:58:09] <drakonis> https://cuberule.com/ manicennui
[01:58:09] <buttsbot> The Cube Rule
[01:58:13] <drakonis> idk
[01:58:25] <drakonis> there are so many ways that nix can be improved
[01:58:42] <drakonis> but they're never going to happen without a complete rewrite
[01:59:08] <drakonis> also fuck nix lang
[01:59:22] <drakonis> companion_cube: wouldnt that be restrained to lua itself?
[01:59:38] <companion_cube> why does that matter for a configuration language?
[01:59:40] <drakonis> since fennel is practically lua with a new skin?
[01:59:50] <drakonis> because there'll be other things beyond just the configuration language
[02:00:13] <companion_cube> you could implement the rest in Rust™, with embedded lua :)
[02:00:15] <Brekkjern> Xe: Guacamole is extra
[02:00:18] <drakonis> hah
[02:00:24] <drakonis> no thanks
[02:00:29] <drakonis> i'd do it in ocaml any time
[02:00:37] <drakonis> but not rust
[02:01:18] <drakonis> its hardly what i'd call stable
[02:01:24] <drakonis> a stable language
[02:02:02] *** Joins: moose (~moose@user/moose)
[02:02:30] <indigo> Stable genius
[02:02:49] <drakonis> no pls

[02:03:59] <drakonis> horse_ebooks
[02:07:14] <drakonis> wow chrome has working tab sliding
[02:07:28] <drakonis> i can now have an excessive amount of tabs
[02:07:30] <companion_cube> not sure what makes you think that drakonis
[02:07:38] <companion_cube> rust is post 1.0, it's very stable if you don't use async stuff
[02:08:02] <drakonis> not that kind of stability
[02:08:14] <companion_cube> what kind of stability?
[02:08:29] <drakonis> i mean the one where i can expect that my code will last longer than a year unchanged
[02:08:34] <companion_cube> well, yes
[02:08:36] <companion_cube> it's post 1.0
[02:08:49] <companion_cube> if anything it has a slightly better story than OCaml on this point
[02:09:00] <drakonis> good to know
[02:09:19] <companion_cube> there's lockfiles with semver, for dependencies; and the compiler generally doesn't break your code
[02:09:36] <companion_cube> (look up the edition system if you're interested in how they manage change)
[02:11:17] <drakonis> was looking to do it with common lisp because it has a variety of incredibly practical runtime features
[02:11:42] <drakonis> also not too difficult to work with
[02:13:15] <drakonis> best debugging experience so far too
[02:15:13] <drakonis> it works with what i want to do
[02:15:29] <drakonis> one of the things that i hate about dealing with nix and guix is that if something fails, i have to restart the entire build process
[02:16:04] <drakonis> restart the whole thing instead of finding out why it is broken and fix it then resume
[02:16:49] <Brekkjern> gif is a ridiculously inefficient format
[02:16:52] <Brekkjern> Like... Wow
[02:19:04] <Brekkjern> And ugly as sin
[02:20:22] <manicennui> How dare you.
[02:20:57] <Brekkjern> What? Convert the video to gif?
[02:21:06] <manicennui> Disparage gif.
[02:21:15] <manicennui> Gif has brought hours of enjoyment to billions!
[02:21:22] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[02:21:29] <Brekkjern> And now it's time for it to be retired
[02:21:31] <Brekkjern> I mean, holy fuck'
[02:21:57] <Brekkjern> I have a 4MB webm that I made into a gif and it's now 80MB and looks like crap
[02:23:10] <indigo> It probably takes more CPU to decode too
[02:23:21] <Brekkjern> Oh yes
[02:25:55] <defect> gifs are pretty much a bunch of bitmaps, a interval to switch between them, and possibly a flag to loop the thing, aren't they? :P

[02:37:00] <Brekkjern> The webm is smaller than the gif, and it's in 3440x2160...
[02:37:03] <Brekkjern> And better colours
[02:39:50] <defect> the majority of all those pixels don't change though
[02:48:53] <manicennui> I bet some included software on the Mac could make a better gif.
[02:49:34] <Brekkjern> It feels like a travesty to convert these beautiful scenes to gifs though
[02:49:45] <Brekkjern> The visual detail in 4k is just awesome
[02:51:22] <defect> why are you converting them to gif? :P
[02:51:55] <Brekkjern> Discord doesn't autoplay webm or mp4
[02:52:01] <defect> oh
[02:52:01] <Brekkjern> Nor does it loop them
[02:52:06] <defect> that's disappointing
[02:52:09] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[02:52:15] <Brekkjern> So I stopped converting them :P
[03:30:09] <imode> I feel somewhat better. no longer feel like a walking bag of bones.

[17:04:51] <Brekkjern> skyl4rk: Not cool.
[17:04:56] <Brekkjern> lol
[17:05:18] <Brekkjern> I read that and got really concerned for a moment. Now I am absolutely sure you need therapy, but for other reasons.
[17:06:38] <skyl4rk> It is difficult to express through text, but I am very remorseful and will work tirelessly to regain the respect of this channel and perl programmers worldwide.
[17:08:18] <gerikson> skyl4rk: you jest, but I've seen multiple AoC solutions in perl that are just regexes
[17:10:22] <skyl4rk> well, to be frank, I like regexes, and perl makes them easier to use than most if not all other languages
[17:10:59] <skyl4rk> even more frankly, I like my own regexes, other peoples maybe not so much, and I guess that is the problem with regexes

[18:15:48] <ngoldbaum> no nazi overtones here nosiree

[18:16:18] <buttsbot> I am leaving LLVM | Lobsters
[18:17:11] <ngoldbaum> also still love this aphyr comment https://lobste.rs/s/nf3xgg/i_am_leaving_llvm#c_ubyrb0
[18:17:12] <buttsbot> I am leaving LLVM | Lobsters
[18:17:20] <imode> ngoldbaum: what the _fuck_
[18:17:59] <imode> wow, they really are nazis.
[18:18:25] <ngoldbaum> imode: i know right how dare i as an american say that there are nazis in europe and not just dudes havin’ good times in the woods
[18:18:50] <imode> hope he contracts COVID.
[18:18:57] <imode> how's that for a hot take.
[18:18:58] <gerikson> you don't have to be a literal nazi to be a toxic, misogynistic rightwinger
[18:18:59] <ngoldbaum> also this was like a month after the charlottesville riot
[18:19:16] <ngoldbaum> torchlit processions that got zero worldwide coverage, especially in right wing circles
[18:20:34] <imode> lmao ban this high-and-mighty white supremacist LARPer.
[18:23:40] <epilys> at least they still write new stuff in C so less people will take them seriously
[18:23:51] <ngoldbaum> imode: https://twitter.com/pid_eins/status/1113738766471057408 also frign likes to send lennart poettering harassing emails from a host called “wolfsschlanze”
[18:23:51] <buttsbot> Twitter - pid_eins - … but I guess that's their kind of humour, and I can certainly tune my spam filter to match this kind of spam, too. What total...
[18:25:56] <imode> uh, so, minor question.
[18:26:05] <imode> why have we not banned suckless as a thing on lobste.rs yet.
[18:26:15] <imode> like, it's not welcome no matter how "technical" it is.
[18:26:26] <ngoldbaum> i guess pushcx gives a more general interpretation to all this than i do
[18:26:29] <imode> I could see it as a front for actual white supremacy.
[18:26:46] <imode> pushcx nazi sympathizer confirmed.
[18:27:03] <ngoldbaum> plan9 also has a lot of winking white supremacist “humor” and people get huffy when you bring that up
[18:27:11] <ngoldbaum> err 9front
[18:27:16] <ngoldbaum> not plan9 as such
[18:27:25] <imode> can any of these morons get laid. is that the problem.
[18:27:42] <imode> you're a relatively fit individual. why you gotta do this.
[18:28:05] <ngoldbaum> imode: i mean did you see that group picture from the suckless meetup?
[18:28:14] <ngoldbaum> definitely a thumb head convention
[18:28:33] <imode> what a pathetic bunch of LARPers.
[18:28:42] <ngoldbaum> also yeah they think writing greenfield C in 2022 is a good idea
[18:28:43] <imode> derive your self value from something other than smelling your own shit.
[18:28:48] <ngoldbaum> which, like, wow
[18:29:14] <imode> the C part isn't what I take issue with. it's that their ethos is that it's the only idea.
[18:29:57] <imode> "people who would love to kill people with disabilities don't make usable software"
[18:29:58] <ngoldbaum> i mean, at least it’s an ethos dude
[18:30:11] <skyl4rk> hah
[18:30:11] * ngoldbaum finally got to use that quote in its correct context
[18:30:11] <epilys> what are you an ethos ranger now?
[18:30:52] <skyl4rk> I'm beginning to be sorry I ever asked.
[18:31:05] <gerikson> RMS simps, anti-systemd folks, gopher bunkers (bitreich), suckless, openbsd... plenty of alt right in FLOSS
[18:31:17] <imode> O
[18:31:39] <imode> *I'm not a fan of systemd but I'm not going to not use something because of that.
[18:31:50] <gwozniak> Usually comes with the "all about my freedoms" crowd
[18:31:51] <imode> what the fuck is bitreich.
[18:32:04] <gerikson> linux people with a gopherhole
[18:32:15] <imode> why is it always nazis.
[18:33:21] <epilys> there are always more nazis out there than one thinks
[18:34:31] <epilys> when the literally nazi party "golden dawn" got popular in Greece I think it got 7% of the popular vote. And they were a party openly assassinating activists and immigrants
[18:34:41] <imode> build a wall around them.
[18:34:59] <imode> throw 'em on a sand bar.
[18:35:05] <epilys> they put them in an already made wall (they all went to jail last year)
[18:35:14] <imode> good.
[18:35:28] <imode> catch and kill.
[18:35:30] <epilys> they-> the party, not the 7% of the greek population who voted for them.
[18:35:39] <epilys> those are still out there.
[18:35:52] <imode> why not arrest 7%.
[18:36:11] <imode> if the jails aren't big enough, just chuck 'em off a cliff.
[18:36:13] <epilys> we've already had one civil war
[18:36:15] <imode> they will not be missed.
[18:36:56] <epilys> btw, according to officially statistics the majority of police voted for them.
[18:37:13] <epilys> they vote in separate districts so you can see the percentages.
[18:37:29] <imode> neat. forget jail, throw 'em all off a cliff.

[19:14:34] <Brekkjern> Hmmm. I just found out that Resolve manages audio just fine in mp4, but not mkv containers
[19:43:20] <manicennui> Raynox DCR-250 Super Macro Snap-On Lens
[19:43:36] <manicennui> So he is using a magnifier on the end of his 90mm lens.
[19:44:39] <indigo> Brekkjern: clearly they need more Russians on their team for mkv
[19:49:48] <Brekkjern> indigo: Yeah
[19:56:10] <ngoldbaum> isn’t mkv patent encumbered?
[19:56:18] <Brekkjern> IIRC it's the opposite
[19:57:39] <ngoldbaum> oh you’re right
[20:01:10] <Brekkjern> The scene autodetection in Resolve is fucking amazing
[20:01:28] <Brekkjern> Just point it at a file and it cuts up the entire video into scenes for you
[20:03:11] <epilys> what's Resolve?
[20:04:12] <Brekkjern> Video editing software
[20:06:47] <epilys> ah davinci?
[20:07:01] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[20:07:12] <epilys> thought you meant some foss project and got excited :(
[20:08:17] <Brekkjern> Heh
[20:08:21] <Brekkjern> No such luck
[20:13:23] <gerikson> imode: for some reson, some people who are anti-systemd have really weird ideas about other stuff
[20:13:41] <imode> gerikson: I have really weird ideas. just ones that aren't racist.
[20:13:50] <imode> heh.
[20:21:14] <ngoldbaum> “some reason”
[20:21:24] <ngoldbaum> retvrn to tradition of sysvinit
[20:21:44] <gerikson> I mean it cuts across "ideology"
[20:21:47] <gerikson> RMS is a liberal
[20:21:54] <gerikson> but he's defended by rightists
[20:21:59] <gerikson> systemd is GPL
[20:22:07] <gerikson> but hated by GNUfolk
[20:27:48] <riv> That's funny isn't it, why do they love him so much
[20:27:54] <riv> is it just because he's an extremist?
[20:28:14] <manicennui> Because he is disgusting.
[20:28:19] <riv> lol
[20:28:32] <manicennui> "He's one of us!"
[20:29:27] <ngoldbaum> the defense of pedophilia?
[20:30:17] * manicennui waits for someone to do a "Well actually what you call pedophilia...
[20:30:31] <epilys> foot eating, the weird bird thing... what else?
[20:30:37] <drakonis> the plant thing
[20:30:41] <drakonis> he likes smelling dead plants
[20:30:44] <epilys> oh yeah
[20:30:46] <epilys> plant sex
[20:31:20] <epilys> reading these "articles" on his website was pretty sobering to younger me.
[20:31:50] <epilys> disillusionment.

[20:36:22] <imode> didn't RMS have a wife at some point.
[20:36:55] <drakonis> nope
[20:37:27] <drakonis> he was never married
[20:38:01] <epilys> probably has/had houseplants though.
[20:38:10] <imode> wait does he seriously want to fuck a fern.
[20:38:19] <drakonis> yes
[20:38:26] <imode> ...please post evidence, I need a laugh.
[20:39:34] <drakonis> he's into nasal sex with dead plants

[20:40:25] <Brekkjern> I feel like this should have been included in posix me harder
[20:40:25] <buttsbot> Richard wasn't planning on having sex today, or ever again, frankly. He was surprised to learn Eric had planned a threesome.
[20:40:46] <imode> LOL.
[20:40:47] <companion_cube> :DDD
[20:40:51] <imode> I KNOW WHERE THAT'S FROM.

[20:41:03] <ngoldbaum> lmao someone put it on wikipedia
[20:41:20] <drakonis> also that's the rms/esr slashfic
[20:41:27] <imode> nasal. sex. with planets.
[20:41:28] <imode> *plants.
[20:41:29] <bkero> 'eh, that's a 4 out of 10 on the creep-o-meter
[20:41:43] <Brekkjern> What is? The posix me harder story?
[20:41:43] <buttsbot> "I'll be gentle... I know all about project management," Eric promised.
[20:41:53] <imode> HHAHAHAHHAAHH
[20:41:57] <imode> I'm dead.
[20:42:14] <ngoldbaum> bkero: handing that card to random women at a conference is at least 8/10
[20:42:53] <companion_cube> imode: you want to have nasal sex with planets? ambitious
[20:43:02] <bkero> ngoldbaum: in that context I can see that
[20:43:05] <imode> gotta get bigger nostrils.
[20:43:08] <imode> "I required him to demonstrate nasal sex in public with a plant as a condition of meeting him."
[20:43:17] <imode> is he just. talking about. sniffing flowers.
[20:43:22] <manicennui> Right in the phloem.
[20:43:25] <imode> because technically flowers are reproductive organs.
[20:43:39] <epilys> it's part of his thing about being literal, I think
[20:43:42] <imode> that is a level of technically correct that rivals niel degrasse tyson.
[20:43:49] <epilys> that was the same issue with the Eipstein comments
[20:43:50] <drakonis> rms is so fucking weird
[20:43:59] <drakonis> to a fault
[20:44:08] <imode> what were the epstein comments again?
[20:44:14] <imode> arguing in favor of pedophelia?
[20:44:28] <epilys> that was a separate incident
[20:44:30] <drakonis> no, it was being technically correct about minsky
[20:44:30] <epilys> haha
[20:44:40] <imode> oh good lord.
[20:44:51] <imode> there are multiple incidents?
[20:45:01] <epilys> leads?
[20:45:05] <drakonis> yes
[20:45:12] <epilys> they got us working in shifts!
[20:45:14] <drakonis> the rabbit hole goes deeper
[20:45:15] <ngoldbaum> he has that microblog thing, there are a number of creepy comments mixed in over the years
[20:45:27] <imode> do we have a "best of".
[20:45:36] <drakonis> you should check rms's rider
[20:45:43] <manicennui> epilys: Random Lebowski quotes?
[20:45:52] <drakonis> that one is a microcosm of weirdness
[20:46:03] <ngoldbaum> clearly the dude is on the spectrum, not that that’s an excuse for the creepyness
[20:46:09] <drakonis> https://github.com/ddol/rre-rms/blob/master/rider.txt
[20:46:10] <ngoldbaum> it is something of an explanation
[20:46:10] <buttsbot> rre-rms/rider.txt at master · ddol/rre-rms · GitHub
[20:46:13] <drakonis> he is, yes.
[20:46:22] <drakonis> but its not like he ever tried to improve himself
[20:46:23] <ngoldbaum> but doesn’t explain how much of an asshole he is
[20:46:30] <imode> "There is little evidence to justify the widespread assumption that willing participation in pedophilia hurts children."
[20:46:34] <imode> ohohohokay.
[20:46:40] <companion_cube> I mean it's true
[20:46:42] <ngoldbaum> i witnessed him screaming at his host for a talk in front of the audience for not following that rider
[20:46:44] <companion_cube> since it's never _willing_
[20:46:49] <companion_cube> there cannot be consent :)
[20:47:15] <drakonis> there's multiple riders
[20:47:17] <drakonis> wow
[20:47:23] <imode> jfc.
[20:47:28] <drakonis> multiple versions
[20:47:42] <ngoldbaum> iirc they didn’t have people selling fsf merch, they just put it in the front
[20:47:45] <imode> rms is a water line. if you fall that low, just like.. go live in a cave.
[20:47:55] <drakonis> i kind of understand why open source distanced itself from free software
[20:48:04] <manicennui> Please don't disparage cave living.
[20:48:04] <drakonis> because uhhh
[20:48:08] <companion_cube> right, cause ESR is better… not
[20:48:09] <drakonis> rms is a fucking creep
[20:48:17] <drakonis> also esr is another mega creep
[20:48:31] <epilys> manicennui, I was replying to "multiple incidents" but the correct quote was "separate incidents?"
[20:48:33] <imode> I haven't heard much about ESR, what's he doin'.
[20:48:33] <manicennui> RMS is just a level of geek that you don't understand!
[20:48:42] <ngoldbaum> let me tell you going into an RMS talk after reliving my dad yelling at me as a kid because of how angry RMS’ yelling was is a great intro to a public talk
[20:48:42] <drakonis> i have no idea now
[20:48:43] <cb> rms seems mostly misguided and stubborn
[20:48:45] <cb> esr is greasy
[20:48:51] <manicennui> epilys: Yeah, and I think it was a different scene, wasn't it?
[20:48:52] <imode> define greasy.
[20:48:54] <ngoldbaum> we left halfway through the talk
[20:48:55] <cb> slimy
[20:48:58] <cb> shady
[20:48:59] <drakonis> gun nut, pua
[20:49:03] <manicennui> epilys: The separate incidents was the initial report with the cops.
[20:49:10] <imode> oh joy.
[20:49:17] <epilys> manicennui, yeah, they were separate incidents/scenes.
[20:49:20] <manicennui> epilys: And the lines you quoted were later when they found his car but not something in it.
[20:49:32] <epilys> the story is ludicrous
[20:49:41] <imode> what story.
[20:49:54] <epilys> of Big Lebowski
[20:50:00] <ngoldbaum> huh esr stopped blogging
[20:50:02] <manicennui> A coworker who watches a lot of movies revealed that he doesn't like The Big Lebowski and I'm not sure what to think about that.
[20:50:05] <imode> hahahaha. yes it is.
[20:50:16] <imode> what's PUA.
[20:50:20] <drakonis> pick up artist
[20:50:24] <ngoldbaum> epilys: that’s just like you’re opinion man
[20:50:28] <epilys> "story is ludicrous" is a quote from Big Lebowski, when they were watching that porn VHS with Maud.
[20:50:28] <ngoldbaum> your fuck
[20:50:43] <drakonis> its a whole another microcosm of slimy pieces of shit
[20:50:45] <manicennui> epilys: a lotta ins, a lotta outs, a lotta what-have-yous
[20:51:12] <epilys> lotsa strands in old duder's head
[20:51:12] <imode> now I just wanna rewatch it.
[20:51:59] <manicennui> I used to have a Coen Brothers DVD collection. Hate that I got rid of it.
[20:52:08] * ngoldbaum wants some sioux city sasparilla
[20:52:23] <epilys> What does it taste like? Think that's a strictly american thing
[20:52:33] <manicennui> DVD collections were typically way better than the collections they put together now.
[20:52:42] <manicennui> Blu ray collections are cheap as fuck.
[20:52:56] <manicennui> Just chuck the discs in the cheapest plastic case imaginable.
[20:53:10] <ngoldbaum> epilys: floral kinda like root beer
[20:53:14] <manicennui> epilys: Root beer more or less AFAIK
[20:53:33] <epilys> root beer == ginger beer?
[20:53:36] <imode> nah.
[20:53:36] <ngoldbaum> they don’t really have it anymore, it was more of like an old west thing
[20:53:49] <manicennui> I need to watch Fargo again.
[20:53:56] <imode> ginger beer is made from ginger root, root beer is sassafrass.
[20:54:00] <ngoldbaum> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_beer
[20:54:00] <buttsbot> Root beer - Wikipedia
[20:54:02] <imode> *sassafras
[20:54:09] <manicennui> I think there are some potential health problems with sasparilla.
[20:54:18] <manicennui> sarsaparilla
[20:54:32] <ngoldbaum> a lot of europeans i know hate root beer
[20:54:43] <ngoldbaum> they think it tastes like toothpaste which is just confusing to me
[20:54:59] <imode> apparently the extract is carcinogenic, neat.
[20:55:05] <ngoldbaum> definitely a US/Canadian thing
[20:55:13] <manicennui> I used to love root beer. I haven't had it in a long time.
[20:55:30] <ngoldbaum> diet a&w is good
[20:55:34] <imode> cream soda is better.
[20:55:45] <manicennui> Black cherry soda is good.
[20:55:53] <manicennui> But soda doesn't do much for me anymore.
[20:56:06] <manicennui> I used to drink a ton of it. Now I have it a few times per year and it seems meh.
[20:56:12] <manicennui> Never thought I'd get to this point.
[20:56:53] <companion_cube> to me, root beer and soda are too sweet
[20:56:55] <epilys> Sodas aren't very popular besides coca cola stuff in europe
[20:56:58] <companion_cube> and I avoid them, sugar is crack
[20:57:15] <companion_cube> epilys: and a bit of ice tea/oasis/… I guess
[20:57:29] <companion_cube> depends on the country probably
[20:57:56] <manicennui> I love unsweetened iced tea.
[20:58:10] <manicennui> And hibiscus tea.
[20:58:33] <epilys> iced coffee in Greece
[20:58:56] <epilys> when I asked ice for my espresso in the Netherlands I was told multiple times "we don't do that here"
[20:59:05] <epilys> like it's a sin.
[20:59:07] <manicennui> Frankly, Starbucks does iced coffee well, especially their nitro cold brew.
[20:59:14] <manicennui> It is way better than their hot coffee.
[20:59:15] <companion_cube> I mean
[20:59:19] <companion_cube> ice? in an espresso????
[20:59:34] <ngoldbaum> ice lattes are nice sometimes
[20:59:40] <companion_cube> an espresso is supposed to be hot, freshly made
[20:59:44] <ngoldbaum> but like an espresso shot why would you do that
[20:59:51] <epilys> companion_cube, it's called "freddo espresso" in greece.
[20:59:57] <companion_cube> that's so weird :s
[21:00:00] <epilys> it's a greek thing
[21:00:00] <imode> they wanna be cold and wired.
[21:00:01] <manicennui> epilys: Ask them for an iced Americano.
[21:00:07] <epilys> we don't do that here.
[21:00:21] <imode> tf does "we don't do that here" mean. it's ice.
[21:00:32] <imode> just drop some ice into it.
[21:00:45] <imode> or I will come here every single day, order an espresso, and dump an entire bag of ice into it on your floor.
[21:00:48] <manicennui> Give the customer an espresso and a cup of ice.
[21:00:55] <companion_cube> imode: they might not have ice :D
[21:01:02] <imode> it's the netherlands!
[21:01:05] * manicennui bans imode from the coffee shop
[21:01:05] <imode> GO OUTSIDE!
[21:01:09] <companion_cube> I think an average french café might not have ice, for example
[21:01:19] <companion_cube> (could be wrong!)
[21:01:25] <epilys> imode, I only went to third wave coffeeshops, that's why
[21:01:36] <manicennui> What is a third wave coffee shop?
[21:01:44] <epilys> elitist about espressos.
[21:01:56] <ngoldbaum> getting a warm coke without ice in italy as a kid was a culture shock
[21:01:56] <imode> like, do you want my money or not.
[21:02:03] <epilys> this is what a freddo looks like https://europeancoffeetrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Freddo-Espresso-1.jpg
[21:02:17] <epilys> it's densely flavoured
[21:02:39] <manicennui> Looks like a cortado with ice.
[21:02:39] <ngoldbaum> isn’t fanta popular in europe too?
[21:03:10] <epilys> yeah (owned by coca cola)
[21:03:37] <manicennui> Europeans all dance like the women in the Fanta commercials too.
[21:03:45] <ngoldbaum> so is barq’s root beer :p
[21:03:49] <manicennui> And sing that song.
[21:03:51] <ngoldbaum> although barq’s is terrible
[21:04:17] <companion_cube> epilys: so do they pour the shot in advance to get it cold?

[21:04:28] <epilys> no, the extraction is over ice
[21:04:32] <epilys> directly
[21:04:46] <companion_cube> waaaaat
[21:05:01] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: what's a good root beer? Everything I try mostly taste like Barq's, although I haven't had Barq's in a while
[21:05:34] <epilys> coca cola did a thing recently in Greece, a greek startup launched a stevia cola and then coca cola created a stevia version and heavily promoted it until the other cola disappeared from everywhere, which is was when coca cola also stopped their stevia promotion
[21:05:42] <epilys> it was all to remove them from the market
[21:06:19] <ngoldbaum> i vastly prefer a&w or doc brown’s
[21:06:35] <manicennui> I have a crazy idea that I think would eliminate a lot of problems with corporations, although they would try to find ways around it.
[21:06:43] <ngoldbaum> i think canadian a&w might be different from american though
[21:06:50] <manicennui> I think we should tax all corporate *revenue* over $1 billion per year at 100%.
[21:07:00] <manicennui> Basically make it so there is an upper limit on growth.

[21:07:57] <bkero> mmm donair
[21:08:04] <manicennui> I think it would limit company's ability to do a lot of bad shit.
[21:08:10] <epilys> cb, turkey?
[21:08:14] <manicennui> companies'
[21:08:28] <manicennui> And it would actually encourage competition.
[21:08:32] <cb> epilys: eastern canada
[21:08:37] <cb> it's kinda like a gyro
[21:08:45] <cb> but with beef instead of lamb spit (not too weird)
[21:08:52] <epilys> doner is a thing all over europe
[21:08:53] <cb> ...and a sweet garlic sauce instead
[21:09:19] <imode> sweet garlic sauce is life.
[21:09:25] <epilys> beef? I swear I've only seen pork and lamb.
[21:09:56] <epilys> Pork doner for nonmuslims (haram) and lamb for the rest (halal)
[21:10:11] <cb> well, it's beef here because beef is more common than either
[21:10:48] <epilys> is donair a french-isation?
[21:10:50] <epilys> -air
[21:11:07] <ngoldbaum> canadianization

[21:11:51] <ngoldbaum> in the US it’s the great yu-row, jay-row war
[21:11:53] <companion_cube> like apple stores in europe having 0 profit
[21:12:00] <companion_cube> (revenue, yes, profit, no)
[21:12:22] <companion_cube> so you would have constellations of smallish companies, trading favors as if they were components of an actual big company, I think
[21:12:50] <manicennui> companion_cube: Frankly, I think it could actually be dealt with, but people in power don't actually want to deal with it.
[21:13:04] <manicennui> The UK has a body with pretty significant power for lenders.
[21:13:07] <companion_cube> and they convinced most people that they don't want it either
[21:13:16] <companion_cube> because what if you become rich?!
[21:13:16] <manicennui> And a lot of their power is not spelled out in the regulation.
[21:13:22] <manicennui> It's up to their discretion.
[21:13:28] <manicennui> And they fuck lenders up who are doing bad shit.
[21:13:35] <manicennui> Put a bunch of them out of business.

[21:21:23] <manicennui> Effective regulation is difficult in the US because in many cases, if not most, the regulation is just throwing a bone to citizens that doesn't really hurt corporations.
[21:22:06] <manicennui> An industry has to be really bad and lose a lot of support to face real regulation.
[21:22:18] <manicennui> Look at how long it took to do something about tobacco products.

[21:35:44] <imode> it's pretty accurate.
[21:36:03] <imode> source: divorce court.
[21:36:31] <skyl4rk> the cost prohibitive part might be accurate
[21:36:46] <skyl4rk> the international ranking claim needs some credentials and sources
[21:37:00] <manicennui> imode: I meant the first part.
[21:37:03] <manicennui> Not the second part.
[21:37:03] <imode> ah.
[21:37:13] <imode> yeah the first one is BS.
[21:37:33] <manicennui> Seems like typical "America #1!" bullshit.
[21:38:08] <manicennui> * The US was the only country considered in this ranking
[21:38:58] <companion_cube> it's the best at dealing with US law
[21:39:31] <skyl4rk> I think I can kind of link it with prosperity gospel bs, in that it might be based on things like "if it wasn't the best in the world, then the US would not have it"

[21:42:32] <manicennui> Clearly we just need Musk to create some kind of rapid transport system between hospitals so we can better utilize ICUs.
[21:42:41] <manicennui> No need to take precautions and vaccines.
[21:43:28] <manicennui> If we could introduce cryptocurrency-based auctioning of ICU beds into the mix...

[22:07:36] <indigo> Man, iCloud Drive *is* kinda shitty :(
[22:07:41] <indigo> Especially the Windows client
[22:09:44] <indigo> Although I have heard some bad things about Syncthing
[22:18:35] <manicennui> I agree with the author's general sentiment, but as people on HN pointed out, Dropbox/iCloud mostly solve a different problem for most people.
[22:22:22] <indigo> I interviewed at Dropbox once... it was an interesting experience
[22:23:12] * Geekingfrog wants to know more
[22:23:57] <manicennui> I don't doubt that companies like that have some really interesting tech, but most of the people are working on adding crappy features to bloat their product.
[22:24:13] <manicennui> Always. Be. Growing.
[22:25:39] <indigo> Geekingfrog: One of my interviewers spent quite a long time explaining to me about the culture of quality at Dropbox. His example was that the cafe there plates your food
[22:26:03] <indigo> And when plating it, they wipe the edge of the plate
[22:28:17] <imode> cool. I caused a bug in prod.
[22:28:27] <imode> thankfully it's not that big of a deal.
[22:28:49] <companion_cube> omg imode you literally brain-engineered this bug to life
[22:28:54] <companion_cube> take responsibility for its fated birth
[22:29:17] <manicennui> indigo: I would have asked what happened if they forgot to wipe.
[22:29:20] <imode> it's a single line bug. always check before you cast, kids.
[22:29:53] <imode> t;ldr reporting code cast a generic value type to a textual type without checking for it.
[22:30:00] <imode> said cast was in a catch block.
[22:30:10] <imode> so it keeps eating exceptions.
[22:30:20] <imode> really should've caught that.
[22:30:57] <manicennui> We have a serious bug and we couldn't find the error in the logs. Turns out it was being captured and returned to the API caller. The caller in this case is our call center app, which displayed the error to the user.
[22:31:46] <manicennui> Fortunately some of them told us the exact error message.
[22:31:54] <manicennui> But the bug has existed for a while, and causes a really serious problem.
[22:32:16] <manicennui> The call center people are used to retrying things when they fail, so they never mentioned it before.
[22:33:24] <gerikson> ime call center people are long-suffering
[22:33:30] <manicennui> Yup.
[22:33:32] <gerikson> there's so much terrible software
[22:33:45] <gerikson> and no-one gives a shit what a peon in CC thinks
[22:33:55] <manicennui> Our product people never prioritize making things better for the call center because it doesn't make us more money.
[22:33:56] <gerikson> or they're not incentivized to report it
[22:35:32] <manicennui> Our call center app is this ember monstrosity that is flaky as hell.
[22:35:58] <manicennui> It replaced an old Rails app that did server side rendering, and is still around because a handful of features haven't been added to the new app.
[22:36:05] <manicennui> All of us who have a choice use the old app.
[22:36:18] <manicennui> Including the product people.
[22:36:56] <manicennui> The call center people are all used to refreshing frequently.
[22:37:19] <manicennui> We used to shadow them once per year for an hour, and it was irritating to see how frustrating the software is.
[22:37:23] <manicennui> But they just deal with it.
[22:38:10] <manicennui> They also have a lot of manual processes they have to know about because product didn't want to spend the time automating them.
[22:38:51] <manicennui> We service a couple dozen states, and each has its own quirks. They have to know about a bunch of different state-specific processes.
[22:38:54] <manicennui> I hope we pay them well.
[22:38:58] <Brekkjern> I remember working a place in the call center and we had a ton of requests for help because of something dumb with a wizard. We did the math on it about how much it cost our users and us to deal with the confusion with just the average time to solve on those calls. We could have hired a handful of engineers for that amount in a few months. It never got fixed though...
[22:39:10] <manicennui> The ones I have shadowed were very good.
[22:39:20] <gerikson> I have a theory that time reporting is generally shit becasue the end-customer isn't the person having to use it everyday, it's the manager pulling reports
[22:40:14] <manicennui> Doesn't look like our call center job ads list salary.
[22:40:41] <Brekkjern> IMO, reporting is shit because there really is no way to generate good, actionable reports, so incentivising usage of the functions will just end with reps being incenivised to do dumb shit...
[22:43:03] <Brekkjern> The animators and the voice actor for this clip deserves a fucking award: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/906950496214994985/929083233973456916/ScreamSound.webm
[22:44:28] <manicennui> Looks like we pay around $35k.
[22:44:39] <manicennui> According to glassdoor.
[22:45:24] <manicennui> Indeed agrees.
[22:48:22] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Is that an echo midway through the scream?
[22:49:05] <Brekkjern> manicennui: What are you hearing? She is stomping her foot on the floor, so that might be what you are thinking of?
[22:49:31] <manicennui> It sounds like she makes an initial screaming noise, then it sounds like an echo, then another smaller screaming noise from her.
[22:49:38] <manicennui> I hear the other noises as well.
[22:50:04] <Brekkjern> No, she pauses for a half breath and screams again
[22:50:21] <manicennui> The foot stomp is unfortunate because it looks like it is the sound effect for her grasping her face.
[22:50:31] <manicennui> I definitely hear three distinct screams.
[22:51:08] <Brekkjern> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[22:51:12] <Brekkjern> I'm not hearing an echo
[22:51:43] <manicennui> Maybe it isn't supposed to be an echo, but that is what it sounds like.
[22:54:27] <manicennui> I haven't had takeout delivered for almost a week.
[22:54:38] <manicennui> That's like a record for me.
[23:01:56] <Brekkjern> I rarely order food home. It's way too expensive here
[23:02:09] <Brekkjern> Even takeout is way too expensive to do often
[23:02:09] <manicennui> It's not cheap, but I'm that lazy.
[23:02:30] <manicennui> Plus I am US software engineer wages.
[23:02:34] <manicennui> s/am/make/
[23:02:58] <Brekkjern> I earn way over average Norwegian salary too. Still too expensive :P
[23:03:11] <manicennui> I've been trying to get better, but this week is going really well.
[23:03:34] <manicennui> I had some takeout from Saturday and a few prepared meals from a previous grocery delivery.
[23:03:40] <manicennui> Then got another grocery delivery on Tuesday.
[23:04:36] <Brekkjern> Hmm. Just checked. Average salary is higher than I remembered, but I'm still above it.
[23:05:00] <Brekkjern> I'm on the lower end for software devs though

[23:23:34] <imode> what is fackelmarsche anyway.
[23:23:44] <imode> oh, literally "torch marches"
[23:23:55] <ngoldbaum> imode: like at the nuremberg rally
[23:24:01] <imode> yeh
[23:24:07] <hoistbypetard> ngoldbaum: wow...
[23:24:32] <imode> see naively torch marches look neat af
[23:24:37] <ngoldbaum> also for an actually good comment check out aphy’s highly upvoted comment in that thread
[23:24:40] <hoistbypetard> that might be the only time i've ever seen someone defend against being called a nazi by using the term "cultural marxism"
[23:24:57] <ngoldbaum> hoistbypetard: really drives the point home
[23:25:05] <hoistbypetard> yep
[23:25:59] <imode> my home town used to do torch marches with glow sticks on halloween. they were nothing like this. it was just kids and their parents going through downtown and throwing candy to people on the sides.
[23:26:21] <Brekkjern> Waiting after you get the shot is really boring. I've only waited 2 minutes, but I'm still bored to tears :P
[23:26:30] <imode> Brekkjern: you getting the booster?
[23:26:37] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: play wordle all the cool kids are
[23:27:13] <Brekkjern> imode: yeah. Just got moderna now. Both my previous were Pfizer
[23:27:22] <imode> may god have mercy on your soul.
[23:27:29] <Brekkjern> ngoldbaum: dunno what that is...
[23:27:29] <ngoldbaum> RIP Brekkjern’s arm
[23:27:31] <Brekkjern> Hah

[23:27:40] <buttsbot> Wordle - A daily word game
[23:27:52] <ngoldbaum> that’ll kill a couple minutes at least
[23:28:08] <ngoldbaum> and you can join the emoji square club
[23:28:28] <Brekkjern> Lol
[23:29:29] <imode> if you have enough mental cognition to play wordle after the booster, you're superhuman
[23:29:49] <manicennui> ?
[23:29:50] <ngoldbaum> eh i just had a sore arm
[23:29:58] <ngoldbaum> iirc the booster is a half-dose
[23:30:05] <imode> not moderna iirc
[23:30:06] <manicennui> None of the vaccines have done anything to me.
[23:30:36] <imode> lucky you. I had a 101 degree fever, uncontrollable chills, fatigue and aches all over. coworkers reported similarly.
[23:30:51] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: you can feel smug squinting at the green bars https://twitter.com/paulmainwood/status/1479528897259712513?s=21
[23:30:51] <buttsbot> Twitter - paulmainwood - ICNARC have updated their analysis of COVID patients in critical care in England, Wales and NI. They now show boosted pati...
[23:30:53] <manicennui> I have CTA-level immunity.
[23:31:44] <manicennui> If the vaccine isn't 100% effective no one should take it!
[23:31:48] <manicennui> </sarcasm>
[23:31:57] <Brekkjern>  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[23:32:16] <Brekkjern> I'll either be fine, or completely fucked
[23:32:20] <Brekkjern> Prepared for either
[23:32:29] <manicennui> You could be hit by a bus.
[23:32:36] <manicennui> Stupid vaccine.
[23:32:40] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[23:32:42] <imode> you'll probably feel like you were.
[23:32:54] <manicennui> Thanks, Obama!
[23:33:06] <Brekkjern> I got pretty fucked up by the second Pfizer, so well see
[23:33:19] <Brekkjern> But I did buy painkillers just in case :P
[23:33:44] <imode> lean on them heavily. they are your friend.
[23:33:56] <manicennui> I do.
[23:34:06] <imode> we've done 2 ibuprofen every 4 hours and 2 tylenol every 6.
[23:36:15] <Brekkjern> I have ibuprofen and paracetamol, so I should be fine
[23:36:45] <manicennui> Tylenol is paracetamol.
[23:36:53] <Brekkjern> Ah
[23:37:18] <manicennui> We call the actual drug acetaminophen though.
[23:37:55] <ngoldbaum> we also call lorries trucks
[23:37:57] <Brekkjern> Here the brand names are often varieties of the drug name
[23:38:13] <Brekkjern> Ibux for ibuprofen and Paracet for paracetamol
[23:38:37] <manicennui> Advil is the most common brand-name ibuprofen here.
[23:38:43] <Brekkjern> There are others of course, but those are the most common
[23:39:02] <manicennui> And Tylenol or maybe Excedrin for acteaminophen.
[23:39:47] <manicennui> Most of the generics copy the look for Advil and Tylenol.
[23:39:56] <manicennui> s/for/of/

[23:41:02] <Brekkjern> Lol
[23:53:24] <gwozniak> ahhaha
[23:53:40] <gwozniak> I wonder if they are one of our customers...
[23:54:30] <Brekkjern> For some reason this vaccine hurt a lot more when they inserted the needle than the earlier ones
[23:54:42] <Brekkjern> I barely felt the others, but this one stung
[23:55:44] <hoistbypetard> have you gotten a 5G phone since your earlier shots?
[23:56:06] <Brekkjern> Nope. Still same Pixel 3a
[23:56:27] <Brekkjern> I don't need 5g
[23:56:41] <Brekkjern> Unless it comes with COVID immunity
