[00:18:53] <rpifan> but some people seem to only live for being in the office
[00:19:19] <rpifan> work is depressive, repetive, a waste of time, nothing you do in your office job will have any real meaning

[00:20:58] <estranger> agreed
[00:22:12] <rpifan> still it seems weird to be that people enjoy these office parties. i suppose maybe some people fit a mold much better and being drunk in an office feels liberating
[00:22:20] <rpifan> while to me its the opposite sober or drunk with work people
[00:22:26] <rpifan> you need to keep a face on

[08:41:44] <SirSceptalot> MOOAAAARRRRRR
[08:42:00] * SirSceptalot clears throat
[08:42:04] <SirSceptalot> good morning gentlemen
[08:42:08] <Hunterkll> Work-BWMerlin: lol i've done that intentionally with cisco kit before
[08:42:36] <Hunterkll> there's plenty of valid reasons for that to end up being the case
[08:42:40] <SirSceptalot> 2.5/5?
[08:42:59] <Hunterkll> different networks, load balance handling, directionals, etc etc
[08:43:03] <Hunterkll> so many reasons why it might end up like that
[08:43:19] <SirSceptalot> TIL.
[08:43:44] <Hunterkll> SirSceptalot: i did convention areas and vendor hall areas with cisco kit at one conference, we were stringing up APs literally every 10 feet to handle load
[08:43:44] <Hunterkll> lol
[08:43:45] <SirSceptalot> well EDIL something, because i have a lot to learn
[08:44:05] <Hunterkll> like in a 10ft x 10ft square pattern - 10 feet in any direction from one AP is another 
[08:44:17] <SirSceptalot> dayum
[08:44:54] <SirSceptalot> how do you start spreading out the channels? I assume very low power for each ap to start with?
[08:45:13] <Hunterkll> the WLC does that all automagically
[08:45:21] <Hunterkll> client handoff, channel management, power levels, etc
[08:46:01] <SirSceptalot> oh, sweet
[08:46:24] <Hunterkll> there's a fair amount of reasons that cisco has the #1 market share for enterprise wireless, and it ain't because of the name (mostly)
[08:46:27] <Hunterkll> Aruba's #2 
[08:47:15] <Work-BWMerlin> People in the thread were pointing out other reason such as PoS vendors not wanting/allowing the use of existing WAP infrastructure
[08:47:37] <SirSceptalot> hey, I figured ubnt would be #1 /s
[08:48:07] <Work-BWMerlin> "I can just buy a spare and keep it on the shelf"
[08:48:21] <Work-BWMerlin> It has enterprise features /s
[08:50:26] <csws> run ethernet to the tables imo
[08:50:29] <csws> wifi plebs can leave
[08:50:29] <SirSceptalot> having said that, we only have about 10 wap's for a light load, and I do use unifi. Works 100% great for 90% of the time, sometimes mostly even occasionally!
[08:50:48] * csws updates SirSceptalot's unifi controller
[08:50:55] <csws> now it 100% works 50% of the time!
[08:51:15] * SirSceptalot has quit (ping: 264)
[08:52:10] <SirSceptalot> it's like a kinder surprise!
[08:52:20] <SirSceptalot> it always looks good, but you never know what you're going to get
[08:52:32] <Hunterkll> Work-BWMerlin: I mean, UBNT hardware does work well for what it is
[08:52:34] <Hunterkll> so *shrug*
[08:53:15] <xe0n> Work-BWMerlin is just pissed his previous place didn't go with his solution and decided to go for their own
[08:53:20] <Hunterkll> lol
[08:53:53] <SirSceptalot> if they could stop making a brazilian devices and have some support instead, they'd probably get more market share. I guess, I dunno how things work
[08:54:38] <Hunterkll> fuck
[08:54:42] <Hunterkll> their product lineup is fucking tiny
[08:54:47] <Work-BWMerlin> They are rolling out Aruba after I left
[08:54:54] <Hunterkll> Aruba's pretty good
[08:54:56] <Hunterkll> it's what we use
[08:55:05] <Hunterkll> replaced our cisco setup with it
[08:55:14] <Hunterkll> all buildings managed from central bigass beefy aruba controllers in the datacenters
[08:55:39] <Work-BWMerlin> Where I am currently we (as a org) have something like the largest Cisco network in the southern hemisphere or something like that
[08:56:03] <Hunterkll> i remember our switch off of cisco.... was due to one person's personal vendetta
[08:56:12] <Hunterkll> which, of course, was hilarious because he only had cisco certs
[08:56:38] <Hunterkll> he was on a contract doing work just for that, we made a proposal, cisco sold directly to the customer behind us instead of us selling the hardware to the customer 
[08:56:39] <Hunterkll> lol
[08:56:45] <Hunterkll> he took it personally

[08:57:03] <Hunterkll> so we went full bore brocade/palo alto/aruba

[08:57:16] *** Quits: mh3f_ (~mhowle@cpe-98-25-217-234.sc.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[08:57:25] <Hunterkll> according to him, brocade doesn't support spanning tree
[08:57:26] <Hunterkll> lulz
[08:57:57] <Hunterkll> according to him, "that's not how networking works!" as a-ko's holding up the relevant documentation from microsoft saying that you have to explicitly do this configuration for the product to work....
[08:58:05] <Work-BWMerlin> Ouch, pretty bad of Cisco (or any vendor) to cut out their resellers/VAR's
[08:58:12] <Hunterkll> i mean
[08:58:16] <Hunterkll> we're not really a reseller/var 
[08:58:24] <Hunterkll> it was part of a huge comprehensive project 
[08:58:31] <Hunterkll> involving server deployments/development/etc 
[08:58:45] <Hunterkll> the including hardware/licensing part of the package was just to bump up margins 
[08:59:05] <Hunterkll> it's not our primary line of business, so to speak... not even close to a 3rd line level of business lol
[08:59:16] <Hunterkll> often the customer brings the licensing to us 
[09:00:34] <Hunterkll> and already has the infra/datacenter/whatever setup (unless they're leasing from us or going AWS/Azure routes) 
[09:00:48] <Hunterkll> from their own internal IT organizations and/or centralized IT (keep in mind, our customers are the government)
[09:01:37] <Hunterkll> but yea, it was hilariousi the kinds of faults we started having after that - take down the entire company nationwide by turning on a server, have offices suddenly drop off the face of the earth because we exceeded 8U brocade core router's reliable static route maximums, etc....
[09:02:04] <Hunterkll> we hit static route limitations twice - once on the brocade stacks, another time on the branch office palo alto stacks
[09:06:02] <Work-BWMerlin> I have not seen brocade spoken of highly
[09:06:09] <SirSceptalot> hm, just found out android's phone app has native sip capability
[09:06:12] <Work-BWMerlin> But I have also never worked with the stuff
[09:06:17] <Hunterkll> lots of people don't size it right
[09:06:20] <Hunterkll> but it's decent kit
[09:06:30] <Hunterkll> light years ahead of stuff like fortigate and whatnot
[09:06:41] <Hunterkll> i'd say it's #3 in vendors, that being cisco, juniper, and brocade
[09:06:52] <Work-BWMerlin> Interesting
[09:06:59] <Hunterkll> i've heard a saying going around, basically - you buy what you need capacity wise, right?
[09:07:05] <Hunterkll> for cisco, you buy 100% of what you need based on specs
[09:07:11] <Hunterkll> juniper? 150% oversized 
[09:07:13] <Hunterkll> brocade? 200% 
[09:07:18] <Hunterkll> everyone else? roll some dice and guess
[09:07:41] <Hunterkll> so if i needeed say, 40gig of routing capacity, i'd buy 60gig with juniper, 80 gig with brocade, and 40gig with cisco
[09:08:06] <Work-BWMerlin> Meraki kind of throws that off a little
[09:08:27] <Hunterkll> well meraki wouldn't be in the consideration at all when we're talking a router handling a sustained 40gig traffic load :P
[09:08:28] <Work-BWMerlin> When you start enabling features the device starts to throttle down (talking about the MX firewall)
[09:09:50] <Hunterkll> huh, brocade got bought out by broadcom a while ago 
[09:09:52] <Hunterkll> interesting
[09:10:26] <Hunterkll> so ruckus was acquired by brocade just before brocade was acquired by broadcom lol
[09:10:43] <SirSceptalot> vendor packman
[09:10:52] <SirSceptalot> pacman*
[09:10:58] <Hunterkll> looks like the kit's extreme networks now 
[09:11:12] <Work-BWMerlin> Somewhere in there Symantec is involved
[09:11:53] <Work-BWMerlin> Okay so Broadcom brought out Symantec
[09:11:59] <a1> rest in peace John
[09:12:02] <Hunterkll> yes, they did
[09:12:04] <Hunterkll> but that's unrelated
[09:12:07] <Hunterkll> https://www.extremenetworks.com/product/mlx-series-router/
[09:12:13] <Hunterkll> but yea, i'm talking about when you need kit like that
[09:12:19] <Hunterkll> meraki / smb cisco hardware need not apply
[09:12:33] <Hunterkll> 64 100 GbE, 128 40 GbE, 768 10 GbE, and 1,536 1 GbE ports in a single router
[09:14:31] <Hunterkll> huh, no 400 gig
[09:14:31] <Hunterkll> lame
[09:14:59] <misspwn_> lmao
[09:15:14] <misspwn_> the aruba console pisses me off so much
[09:15:34] <misspwn_> it just looks so shitty
[09:16:36] <misspwn_> i had alerts that two Aruba APs were offline, they weren't offline they are just shitty

[11:59:00] <sd> 13<T​he_Engineer> Hunterkll: quick question regarding your lab, you said you have JAMF MDM server in your lab, they offer some kind of on prem offering or ?
[11:59:10] <Hunterkll> erm
[11:59:25] <Hunterkll> well yea... JAMF started out on-prem... JAMF cloud is their newer offering
[11:59:35] <Hunterkll> has some limitations compared to on-prem but for some people it's enough 
[11:59:47] <sd> 13<T​he_Engineer> Ah alright, thanks for info
[12:00:16] <Hunterkll> JAMF has been around since the early 2000s lol
[12:00:41] <Hunterkll> well, Casper, but you get the idea, name changes and all that
[12:00:55] <SirSceptalot> wait that whole list was your home lab?
[12:01:04] <Hunterkll> SirSceptalot: that's just what's running right now....
[12:01:15] <Hunterkll> it gets a bit of non-"home lab" usage as well
[12:01:38] <SirSceptalot> jesus just when I thought you guys couldn't make me feel like more of a hack, you do this
[12:01:56] <Hunterkll> I have user accounts and services for people who pay me to do shit

[12:02:01] <Hunterkll> hence having offsite shit for reliability 
[12:02:01] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:02:45] <Hunterkll> I could blow up the entire thing and it'd suck, i'd be restoring shit from tape, but external users wouldn't be left high and dry and i'd still be operational, if logins taking a few seconds intead of nearly instant for my computers :P

[12:28:20] <Cl0udNinja> I dont just mean a little noobish like 'oh I got a new game and I dont get the controls', but more like 'holy fuck how do I even do things at all'
[12:29:35] <Cl0udNinja> honestly, tryin to use a hotas/joystick makes me feel slightly retarded
[12:32:32] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: what'd you get?
[12:32:35] <Hunterkll> the X52?
[12:32:39] <Cl0udNinja> yeah
[12:32:42] <Hunterkll> hell yea
[12:33:05] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: also probably because i never had that issue since my dad was a flightsim fanatic in the late 90s so i always had joysticks around? :P
[12:33:14] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[12:33:35] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: he used to do like 14 hour realtime flights with people in multiplayer on flightsim 98 and shit
[12:33:35] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:34:06] <Cl0udNinja> also sadly MW5 doesnt support a lot of the buttons and axis options, even with its remapping file, and tryin to use the x52 hotas programmer
[12:34:24] <Hunterkll> yea but you'll find they come in handy for other shit
[12:34:30] <Hunterkll> did you get the x52 or the x52 pro?
[12:34:37] <Cl0udNinja> the regular one
[12:34:57] <Hunterkll> ah yea for you not much diff, you won't even notice the weaker centering and more plasticky construction till a few years from now lol
[12:35:10] <Cl0udNinja> eh, I noticed the centering already XD
[12:35:19] <Hunterkll> noticed, per say
[12:35:21] <Cl0udNinja> its got a bit a wobble to it
[12:35:23] <Hunterkll> just increase your dead zones
[12:35:29] <Hunterkll> problem solved
[12:35:33] <Cl0udNinja> yeah, I need to get it tuned in
[12:35:49] <Hunterkll> i actually do reccomend a flight sim for that 
[12:35:59] <Hunterkll> something basic and free, doesn't have to be anything fancy 
[12:36:09] <Cl0udNinja> oh snap, Overload is 67% off
[12:36:29] <Hunterkll> what's that?
[12:36:31] <Cl0udNinja> well.. theres another game in my library
[12:36:41] <Cl0udNinja> the Descent creators re-take on Descent
[12:36:50] <Hunterkll> man

[12:36:54] <Cl0udNinja> https://store.steampowered.com/app/448850/Overload/
[12:36:57] <Hunterkll> i still have our original descent discs around here somewhere
[12:37:01] <Hunterkll> i'll have to find that binder 
[12:37:01] <JollyRgrs> space shooters before mouse :D
[12:37:09] <Hunterkll> JollyRgrs: serial joystick worked
[12:37:10] <Hunterkll> :D
[12:37:12] <Oliber> i should reclaim my x52pro from my friend, he's playing the new battlefeld so probably doesn't deserve to have it now \o/
[12:37:12] <DoTheNeedful> s/does/dose
[12:37:14] <layer8> Oliber meant: "i should reclaim my x52pro from my friend, he's playing the new battlefeld so probably dosen't deserve to have it now \o/"
[12:37:22] <Hunterkll> lol!
[12:37:27] <JollyRgrs> Oliber: OMG that game is such trash
[12:37:42] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: but yea, welcome to the x52 club, though that x56 is tempting ....
[12:38:12] <Hunterkll> the split throttle would be a godsend for me
[12:38:16] <Oliber> i only used it for playing elite:dangerous, i bought overload and the descent pack when they were on sale
[12:38:42] <Oliber> but playing those with a stick is probably not as fun as controller
[12:38:44] <Cl0udNinja> Hunterkll, I wasnt even gonna buy the x52 tbh. I was disappointed that Microcenter had basically zero peripherals out for testing, and I drove fuckin forever to get there, so I sorta felt compelled to buy it
[12:38:52] <Cl0udNinja> Oliber, have you played Overload yet?
[12:39:04] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: well i pretty much told you that
[12:39:05] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:39:05] <Oliber> i've played none of them for well over 10yrs :(
[12:39:26] <Cl0udNinja> Hunterkll, yeah, but I mean not even mice
[12:39:41] <Oliber> makes sense with the whole pandemic thing
[12:39:45] <Oliber> NO TOUCHING
[12:39:58] <Cl0udNinja> put a 5gal tub of sanitizer in the isles
[12:40:06] <Cl0udNinja> just dip your hand in it when you're done
[12:40:34] <Oliber> i see you breathing, that's illegal
[12:42:06] <Cl0udNinja> it was basically like 50/50 mask/nomask at Microcenter
[12:42:15] <Cl0udNinja> fuckin no one cares anymore

[12:49:46] <Cl0udNinja> man, I swear I fell out of an alternate reality, because theres stuff like this game I very clearly remember playing and owning, but cannot find any close references to it at all. supposedly it was 'Deadly Tide', but I dont think it was
[12:51:01] <Cl0udNinja> it was out around 98-2000, maybe 96 at the oldest

[12:53:36] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: info on the premise/storyline/gameplay/etc might help us remember
[12:53:37] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:53:47] <xe0n> inb4 it was doom 2
[12:55:29] <Cl0udNinja> it was an underwater game where you had like a sub.. maybe a ship, that had some various weapons around it, was 3d and a bit of an exploration like thing to it. I dont really remember much beyond that, except that I got the sidewinder joystick for that game
[12:55:41] <Cl0udNinja> first person/in ship view
[12:56:01] <Cl0udNinja> aliens were maybe involved?
[12:57:16] <xe0n> was it the id4 games that came on floppies with each toy?
[12:57:49] <xe0n> :D
[12:59:37] <Cl0udNinja> I could've sworn it was a Microsoft game
[13:00:18] <Cl0udNinja> how many unplayed games you all got in your library?
[13:00:21] <xe0n> microsoft golf 98
[13:00:27] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[13:00:57] <Oliber> i remember enjoying SimGolf way back, i don't think it works on modern OSes though
[13:02:10] <Oliber> far too lazy to make that nostalgia work
[13:02:16] <Cl0udNinja> only thing I can tell you about golf is that its so boring, I fell asleep and had a growth spurt while watching it on tv :P
[13:02:43] <Cl0udNinja> I literally woke up about a half inch taller
[13:03:05] <Cl0udNinja> uhg. I need to bed before I regret it
[13:03:18] <xe0n> golf is great when you got beers
[13:04:59] <SirSceptalot> isn't it just the beer and company that make it great then?

[13:06:33] <Hunterkll> ugh
[13:06:36] <Hunterkll> can't find the damn cable
[13:06:41] <Hunterkll> it's around here somewhere though lol
[13:06:53] <Hunterkll> it's probably hanging off a damn sun keyboard
[13:07:52] <Hunterkll> o shit wtf one of my ebay things sold
[13:07:52] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:08:14] <SirSceptalot> worn underwear can go for a nice price i hear
[13:08:24] <Hunterkll> i dont think ebay allows those
[13:08:25] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:08:40] <xe0n> legalinjapan.com does
[13:08:51] <Hunterkll> LOL

[13:09:00] <Hunterkll> tokyo
[13:09:03] <Hunterkll> at least, in vending machines
[13:09:13] <Hunterkll> (yes, it became that much of a problem)
[13:10:13] <SirSceptalot> wut? I mean... it's weird, but why illegal?
[13:10:32] <Hunterkll> because apparently used panty vending machines became that much of a problem
[13:10:33] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:10:43] <SirSceptalot> hah
[13:11:06] <Hunterkll> outlawed in 1993 apparently
[13:11:38] <SirSceptalot> so, the issue was literally too many damn used underwear vending machines around the city? That is both hilarious and sad
[13:13:13] <Hunterkll> "It's also why you could, until around 2002 at least, purchase magic mushrooms via vending machines—they were made illegal around the time of the 2002 World Cup—in love hotels."
[13:14:10] <Hunterkll> "During the 1990s, there was a cottage industry, with some teens cashing in on the schoolgirl craze and selling their "worn" skivvies. So, yes, someone somewhere in Japan would put those in vending machines, too. But that wasn't the main way used panties were sold—they were sold in a certain type of adult store—and it apparently wasn't widespread. This used clothing trade, however, soon came under scrutiny 
[13:14:11] <Hunterkll> for obvious reasons, and a group of used underwear sellers were busted in 1993 for selling schoolgirl underpants; they were nailed for violating the country's child welfare and second-hand seller laws. Today, this type of business is thankfully illegal."
[13:15:13] <Hunterkll> LOL
[13:15:15] <Hunterkll> "While selling used panties is now illegal, coming across a machine that sells “artificially used” or “prepared” panties isn’t completely impossible, as EXCB illustrated – but don’t expect to run into any of these machines during your usual outings there.
[13:15:16] <Hunterkll> "
[13:16:34] <SirSceptalot> "I need to draft a law for WHAT?!"
[13:19:20] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: welp, new cable will be here wednesday

[13:20:10] <SirSceptalot> wednesday, 2 minutes before delivery "oh there it is"
[13:20:24] <Hunterkll> SirSceptalot: yea, but i actually use this cable so 
[13:20:42] <Hunterkll> in fact, i lost the one from my joystick set and was reusing the sun keyboard cable in its place
[13:20:43] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:21:21] <SirSceptalot> speaking about joystick, you ever play crimson skies? I had a LOT of fun with that game
[13:21:27] <Hunterkll> nope
[13:21:42] <SirSceptalot> not a sim, but damn fun
[13:22:15] <Hunterkll> one I really enjoyed was MS Combat Flight Simulator 
[13:22:22] <Hunterkll> came with a thick ass manual with maps and shit

[20:25:40] <teh_f4ll3n> sadly, lots of shit still uses direct FTP updates
[20:25:55] <signofzeta> at least HP lets you "print" a firmware update

[20:26:18] <vinrock> tell me i can print and scan an update that would be so rad
[20:26:29] <signofzeta> well, I don't know if HP allows it anymore, but the old LaserJets let you send a firmware file via 9100 (the same port used for printing)
[20:26:37] <teh_f4ll3n> PublicWiFi, it's probably hardcoded to stay open and only allow ISP connections. doesn't matter if it's old
[20:26:39] <vinrock> lol no shit
[20:26:58] <vinrock> i do pcl over 9100 to a bunch of old 1320s for our checks

[20:27:14] <signofzeta> if the print job had the right PJL header, the printer would see if it was an update file, and if so, cancel the print job and update itself.
[20:27:22] <vinrock> no shit
[20:27:29] <signofzeta> they meant well but dear god that did not age well.

[22:42:44] <PublicWiFi> i wonder if client machines can communication to DC's without SMB traffic being passed
[22:42:58] <PublicWiFi> its listed in the port list here required for domain stuff but....
[22:43:48] <PublicWiFi> oh wait SMB is only needed for dc to dc file replication
[22:43:49] <PublicWiFi> swingo
[22:43:58] <sintax> and a miss!
[22:47:06] <PublicWiFi> nvm im confused
[22:47:08] <PublicWiFi> dammit
[22:47:28] <PublicWiFi> was hoping to deny smb share access based on firewall rule but i don't want to fuck up client to DC communication lol
[22:47:57] <PublicWiFi> ill just deny access to all file servers instead I guess
[22:48:07] <sintax> works for me

[22:49:30] <fritzwastaken> I sometimes feel like PublicWiFi needs an adult at work
[22:50:13] <PublicWiFi> i honestly miss having other people to shoot ideas at
[22:50:15] <PublicWiFi> and vice versa
[22:52:28] <technonerd> Wtf my ups package got delivered in someone's personal vehicle 
[22:52:41] <sintax> how?
[22:52:52] <sintax> i'm an adult!

[22:54:21] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> fuck that, gimme a gpu
[22:54:29] <sintax> i got a 6700xt
[22:54:34] <sintax> my kid wants the ps5
[22:54:41] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> what resolution do you run at?
[22:54:49] <sintax> 5120x1440
[22:54:57] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> and it's got no issues?
[22:55:00] <sintax> no
[22:55:14] <sintax> BF 2042 will run on high settings with an average 40fps
[22:55:17] <sintax> good enough to play.
[22:55:20] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> oh nice
[22:55:20] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> 5760x1080
[22:55:53] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> i'm torn between the 6800 and the 6700 but at this point I feel like I should just wait for the next gen to come out since it'll be stupid expensive regardless
[22:56:10] <sintax> yeah
[22:56:17] <PublicWiFi> hoping my 1080 will last me a while longer
[22:56:24] <technonerd> Wait you bought the new bf 
[22:56:29] <sintax> i'll probably sell my system next year and end up with a new gen amd processor and high end vid card
[22:56:30] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> Wait for the next gen to come out, and then buy the previous gen.
[22:56:34] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> if ur on 1080p, it def will, PublicWiFi

[22:56:53] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> new BF looks lit only for portal tbh
[22:57:05] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> I just want to relive bfbc2 
[22:57:12] <CptLuxx> last good bf
[22:57:12] <technonerd> Just play the old version for fucks sake 
[22:57:14] <CptLuxx> bfbc2
[22:57:19] <technonerd> 3
[22:57:23] <technonerd> Bfbc2
[22:57:24] <sintax> BF 2042 is making me mad though
[22:57:30] <sintax> it will randomly crash on me. 
[22:57:33] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> Then don't play it.
[22:57:38] <sintax> and no rhyme or reason to it. 
[22:57:42] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> bfbc2 was the best environmental, bf3 was the best gunplay
[22:57:49] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> imo
[22:57:50] <sintax> cod2 was the best cod
[22:57:53] <sintax> fight me
[22:57:58] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> no i mostly agree
[22:58:12] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> tho the newest mw was pretty awesome
[22:58:40] <technonerd> I regretted paying for 4 but I mostly played bf3 maps in r 
[22:58:41] <technonerd> 4
[22:59:14] <sintax> BF 2042 will be great if they get the bugs worked out. 
[22:59:22] <PublicWiFi> HurdyGurdyBurdy: yup 1080p! 
[22:59:55] <sintax> I just sold an RX5700XT for $650
[22:59:59] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> wtf
[23:00:05] <sintax> what lol
[23:00:11] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> that's so much
[23:00:19] <sintax> they were going for $800 on ebay...
[23:00:23] <sintax> i undercut and sold to get the cash money
[23:00:25] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> goodness
[23:00:28] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> nvm then lol
[23:00:32] <sintax> yeah it's insane and stupid. 
[23:00:34] <CptLuxx> only 65-
[23:00:35] <sintax> like stupid dumb
[23:00:35] <CptLuxx> 650
[23:00:43] <PublicWiFi> I'm thinking of trying to get a 144hz 1080 monitor though, think thatll matter much? HurdyGurdyBurdy 
[23:00:45] <sintax> i think i paid 450 for it a year ago
[23:00:47] <sintax> or more
[23:01:00] <sintax> PublicWiFi: might smooth out some but you're future proofing. 
[23:01:02] <PublicWiFi> with my 1080 I mean
[23:01:04] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> naw, you'll probably be fine. I'd only start to worry if you start diving into 1440p or 4k
[23:01:10] <PublicWiFi> kk
[23:01:10] <sintax> or get a 4k or 2k and future proof for an upgrade
[23:01:33] <PublicWiFi> 4k is just so demanding on GPUs
[23:01:41] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> 4k is pointless if you game imo
[23:01:49] <PublicWiFi> gotta really have a good gpu to do 4k 60fps or god forbid 144 fps lol
[23:01:52] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> 2k is just as visually clear and half as taxing
[23:02:03] <CptLuxx> just set graphics quality to potato
[23:02:03] <sintax> ^^
[23:02:04] <CptLuxx> done
[23:02:07] <sintax> lol
[23:02:08] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> kek
[23:02:23] <PublicWiFi> or be like me and be like 5 years behind the new games
[23:02:49] * ender 's been running two 5k3k displays on his 1070 for 5 years now
[23:03:02] <sintax> o.O
[23:03:08] <ender> (then again, I don't game much)
[23:03:08] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> i'm on a 1440p and my 970 struggles hard
[23:03:41] <sintax> BF is the first game to make my 6700xt struggle a bit
[23:03:42] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> i also was expecting to get a gpu like, a year ago... until the prices sky rocketed
[23:03:46] <sintax> but it's a decent card made for 1440
[23:05:04] <arlion> sintax: what is your opinion of the recent outrage toward BF? is any of it justified and what has your experience been?
[23:05:11] <sintax> arlion: justified.
[23:05:15] <sintax> at one point I couldn't log in
[23:05:18] <sintax> crossplay is broken
[23:05:23] <sintax> random freezes and crashes. 
[23:05:35] <sintax> i'll go from 40+ fps to 3fps and then back to normal.
[23:05:39] <sintax> it's a shit show mess
[23:05:54] <sintax> the last patch they put out they made the guns better but before one gun just dominated. 
[23:06:04] <sintax> plus the vehicle mechanics are stupid right now. 
[23:06:28] <sintax> there's one, the m5c i think it is, super fast, fast shooting. one dude was talking and the first time with it had 49 kills the first time using it. 
[23:07:13] <sintax> it needs some more patching/updates and i think it will be better. quite a few people put in and got refunds.
[23:07:26] <sintax> with that being said....when it works right and plays well i have a blast
[23:07:41] <sintax> but im also used to games not being finished at this point upon initial release
[23:08:35] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> All of that is not worse Halo Infinite doing no enemy collisions
[23:08:44] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> for some god awful reason

[23:09:45] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> honestly I stopped playing and caring
[23:10:49] <spiderman> sounds like you got your money's worth
[23:15:54] <sintax> i did
[23:16:08] <sintax> i'm enjoying it. just minor annoyances and event viewer doesn't show why it died

[23:36:22] <sintax> haha
[23:36:28] <sintax> thats what i was expecting
