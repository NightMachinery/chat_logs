[00:10:22] <spxtr> my friend is trying to reproduce the results of some astrophysics paper. she's working with one of the coauthors. together they can't reproduce it, and the other coauthor won't share the code with them
[00:11:34] <spxtr> her other project is to extend some work that was published in Nature, along with the code. upon playing with it, it's clear that the results are extremely fine-tuned and the entire paper is wrong. the reviewers never thought to check

[00:53:49] <namespace> saturn2: Like, the thing where people are all "oh we can just keep kicking the philosophy can down the road for another generation to solve".
[00:54:52] <saturn2> oh, interesting
[00:56:17] <rsaarelm> I'm not sure how many people there are who both think of philosophy as something that can be solved and think it's non-urgent.
[00:56:41] <namespace> Which, is implicitly done...okay so there's two philosophical genders: Grifters and fundamentalists. Grifters have beliefs that follow from behavior and fundamentalists have behavior that follows from beliefs.
[00:56:43] <rsaarelm> Like, Yudkwosky wants to solve it, thinks it's very urgent. Mainstream philsophres don't seem to think it's either urgent or can be solved.
[00:57:45] <namespace> And there's a sense in which fundamentalism is intrinsically conflict acceleration because it's non-liberal.
[00:59:17] <saturn2> do you know a way to tell when philosophy has been solved?

[00:59:58] <|dbotdan> John David Pressman (@jd_pressman, 2021-04-27 22:49): ‘Liberalism is a pact to stop being philosophically consistent in exchange for social harmony.’
[01:00:26] <namespace> saturn2: Kinda but I'm not sure how to say it succinctly.
[01:00:33] <namespace> Or rigorously.
[01:00:52] <Fusxfaranto> was anyone philosophically consistent pre-liberalism?
[01:01:49] <rsaarelm> namespace: Are you anywhere in the same ballpark with this as Yudkowsky's "philosophy is solved when you have written and understood the AI algorithm that does it"?
[01:01:50] <namespace> That's a good question.
[01:02:05] <saturn2> not sure what you mean by philosophically consistent
[01:02:06] <namespace> rsaarelm: I wouldn't disagree with that.
[01:02:21] <namespace> The problem though is like.
[01:02:41] <namespace> That doesn't...an AI that does current mainstream philosophy would probably useless except for exploring philosophy space.
[01:02:48] <namespace> It wouldn't actually tell you when you're done.
[01:03:00] <namespace> If you can define the *objective function* bla bla bla you're probably pretty close to solving it tbh.
[01:05:18] <rsaarelm> Can you point to people or movements who seem to be working in the right direction right now?
[01:05:38] <rsaarelm> Academic philosophy right now doesn't seem to be doing very well in the accomplishing things front.
[01:06:06] <namespace> Not right this moment.
[01:06:28] <namespace> Partially that's because I have a weird brain fog atm and am finding it hard to collect my thoughts.
[01:06:48] <saturn2> academic philosophy was sadly blown up in world war 2 and has never been rebuilt
[01:07:42] <rsaarelm> I liked the theory that you need smarter people than the people who are currently going into academic philosophy to advance the state of the art.
[01:08:16] <rsaarelm> The people who can actually think shit done go and set up a Google or an OpenAI instead.
[01:09:37] <bildramer> the people who really really can get shit done make factorio and prevent others from getting shit done
[01:15:25] <rsaarelm> It feels like currently we don't really have a solid social frame or research program for successful philosophy, so interesting times. Philosophy is the ultimate jumping out of the system thing, and it seems like academic philosophy has gone wrong on two fronts of trying to fit philosophy into a bureaucratic mold, which gets you philosophologists, and trying to brute force the jumping out of the
[01:15:27] <rsaarelm> system thing which gets you critical theorists.

[05:23:51] <namespace> Obormot\Arcturus: I'm not talking to you, actually.
[05:25:02] <namespace> It's specifically targeted at like...so it's really about these people I know who I'll talk to about AI stuff and they'll just kind of not update on it?
[05:25:21] <namespace> Like they're still pretending that there will be say, a century of future from now where the status quo holds.
[05:26:12] <namespace> The whole postrat cluster where there's this summertime attitude about stuff.
[05:31:35] <spxtr> it seems like people are always claiming that AI is going to happen on a shorter timescale than people expect, but it's so far happened on a fairly slow timescale
[05:32:54] <namespace> My attitude on AI is something like "it will take less time than you expect if you look at the details and more time than you expect if you look at the big picture".
[05:33:17] <namespace> Or, people overestimate the short term and underestimate the long term, etc.
[05:37:02] <spxtr> I guess I don't see what sorts of decisions need to be made here and now, etc, given that things have been going pretty slowly overall
[05:41:10] <namespace> I mean, compared to what?
[05:41:50] <namespace> The 50's and 60's AI predictions never really made sense and were probably made in at least partial bad faith to bootstrap funding for the field.
[05:42:16] <saturn2> i don't know how you can say that when deep learning only really got going about 5 years ago
[05:43:28] <spxtr> deep learning was already really taking off more like a decade ago, at least for image processing thanks to CNNs
[05:43:29] <saturn2> previous approaches were pretty obviously not getting anywhere, so the timescale was related to how long it would take to find a new approach
[05:43:36] <namespace> ^
[05:43:39] <namespace> But also just like.
[05:43:56] <namespace> You can't just say "the outside view says that this will go slow because it was going slow" without looking at the details of why things were slow.
[05:44:07] <namespace> This is a thing people constantly do and it pisses me off.
[05:44:12] <[itchyjunk]> Didn't AlexNET kick off CNN's in 2012 and it was attributed to a large part to finally having the hardware to train it?
[05:44:33] <namespace> Various indicators of success would be stuff like if you saw AI beginning to be able to describe neuromorphic brains, which it increasingly can.
[05:45:12] <[itchyjunk]> deepmind winning that protein folding competition was a good indicator to me
[05:45:24] <[itchyjunk]> Actual usable predictions
[05:46:45] <namespace> Then the 70's and 80's AI predictions (which I'm admittedly less familiar with) seem to have basically broken down into two camps: Neuromorphic vs. 'We just need to find a cheap algorithm'
[05:46:54] <namespace> And the thing is, the latter was really really popular in the 70's and 80's.
[05:46:57] <namespace> Can you guess why?
[05:47:05] <namespace> Well, neuromorphic wasn't viable, duh.
[05:47:18] <namespace> So of course anyone who wants funding is incentivized to believe it can be done with cheaply computable algorithms.
[05:47:40] <namespace> But Drexler assumes neuromorphic AI in Engines of Creation and the book holds up just fine imo.
[05:48:57] <namespace> Like I don't want to say it was always apriori stupid to think there might be cheap algorithms for AGI, evolution isn't exactly the sharpest tack, but there was obviously a strong incentive to believe that from the perspective of professors who want money for their projects.
[05:50:21] <namespace> Also objectively AI hasn't really been that slow.
[05:50:44] <namespace> Compare its progress to say, the timeline for making living creatures from scratch.
[05:50:57] <spxtr> yes, it's quite fast on that timescale
[05:51:02] <namespace> Something that late 18th century professors and scientists believed was right around the corner after discovering animal electricity.
[05:51:38] <namespace> (Narrator: It was not right around the corner)
[05:53:20] <namespace> (I remember talking to an ex-MIRI person who says my explanation of short timelines based on Drexler was better than what they heard from EY, and it was actually the most plausible argument they'd heard for short timelines, which is kind of hilarious considering that EY started out his transhumanist arc with Engines of Creation and Great Mambo Chicken)

[07:36:40] <Obormot\Gaia> Or, like ... the postrats thing AI will come slowly, let's stipulate that they're wrong about this, but ... what follows from this? What should they be doing that they aren't doing (or vice versa)?

[08:10:37] <aweinstock> Obormot\Gaia: studying more type theory and probability theory and linear algebra, possibly?
[08:11:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> aweinstock: So like "working on deep learning and other possibly-leading-to-AI stuff"?
[08:11:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> If so: wouldn't that actually be bad, as it would lead to greater likelihood of AGI before alignment?
[08:13:36] <aweinstock> aren't all three of those required for alignment research as well as advancing AI capabilities?
[08:14:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Are they? Well ok, so in that case the answer is "work on alignment research"?
[08:14:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> If so, then the followup question is: is alignment research bottlenecked on researchers?
[08:14:55] <aweinstock> (although I guess just suggesting that set of focuses doesn't necessarily bias research away from capabilities and towards alignment)
[08:15:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't recall hearing about MIRI doing a lot of hiring, or trying to... or having a "lack of researchers" problem... am I wrong?
[08:15:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> In any case I doubt that this is what namespace meant... is it?
[08:18:13] <namespace> Obormot\Arcturus: I'm not really in a patient mood right now so I'm going to ignore everything you wrote there.
[08:18:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[08:18:26] <spxtr> haha
[08:18:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's your prerogative, of course
[08:18:48] <namespace> No no I don't even mean that in a...I'm just literally not going to read it.
[08:19:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> It just seems to me like these are obvious questions, and they don't have any obvious answers, but you're acting like they do
[08:19:05] <namespace> Because I'm already mad at communication barriers right now.
[08:19:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> You know? Like if you say "why aren't people doing the thing I want them to be doing" and in response get asked "what is that thing" and you have no answer, then ... well, that's why
[08:19:49] <namespace> Heh.
[08:19:58] <aweinstock> I'm not sure whether it's what namespace has in mind or not, I mainly meant it as a concrete course of action that can be a good or bad way to accomplish the goal of aligned AGI (distinct from meta level stuff)
[08:20:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> aweinstock: I don't disagree with you, I'm just curious what namespace had in mind
[08:20:18] <Ralith> I can't imagine type theory would help much with modern AI
[08:20:22] <namespace> Maybe I was unclear, there's like this really thin line between calm and me just screaming at you in all caps right now.
[08:20:31] <Ralith> more like game theory
[08:20:33] <namespace> And maintaining it requires that I just not interact with you right now.
[08:20:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> namespace: You really don't have to read or respond, it's ok
[08:21:07] <Fusxfaranto_> type theory doesn't seem to help much with modern programming languages, even
[08:21:08] <namespace> That having been said, I was being deliberately really vague in that post, it might have just been better on reflection to have not written it at all.
[08:21:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Although uh maybe the fact that there's that thin line is a signal you may wish to pay attention to)
[08:21:25] <spxtr> I think the most important thing I've learned in life post-20s is how important economics and game theory are for pretty much everything
[08:21:28] <Ralith> I'm holding out hope that someone will come up with a language with an effect system that doesn't suck someday
[08:21:28] <namespace> Since it doesn't actually contain enough bits to really derive what I meant from it.
[08:21:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> namespace: I certainly can't think what you could possibly accomplish by vagueblogging about this
[08:21:53] <namespace> Venting.
[08:21:56] <namespace> tbh
[08:21:57] <aweinstock> type theory helps with reasoning about programs that reason about programs in a more understandable way (at least to me) than pure statistical approaches
[08:22:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Never mind that I still don't know what "this" is)
[08:22:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> namespace: Well fair enough
[08:22:36] <brand0> most of the arguments in favor of "symbolic languages are required for AGI" are pretty flimsy IMO
[08:22:37] <feep> I think my worry with type theory for programming for miri specifically is that there'll never be like ... a type system that can keep up with what miri decides they need that year
[08:22:43] <Ralith> type theory helps with reasoning about conventional logic, which modern AI really isn't
[08:22:53] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: my possibly uncharitable guess is that namespace has been thinking in terms of mysticism and egregores and stuff a bit too much, so he thinks once the right philosophy is invented it will spread everywhere by itself and make people do good things instead of bad things
[08:23:03] * namespace shaking his head
[08:23:19] <Ralith> unless you're, like, trying to prove that your implementation of a neural network is in fact an implementation of a neural network
[08:23:26] <Ralith> but I don't think that's usually considered the hard part of alignment?
[08:23:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I guess that makes "the thing" = "work on inventing the right philosophy"
[08:23:46] <namespace> I was literally just reacting to the people in my life annoying me with their inability to internalize the zeitgeist.
[08:23:48] <feep> though I think something like lisp but built on symbols parsed from reality by a neural network would be interesting
[08:23:59] <namespace> And frankly didn't expect any of you to read it.
[08:24:02] <namespace> My model is you ignore me.
[08:24:08] <namespace> I'm annoyed you guys paid attention tbh.
[08:24:12] <saturn2> ignore you? no way!
[08:24:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Although one may reasonably ask if "make people do good things instead of bad things" will even accomplish anything useful
[08:24:38] <namespace> The speculation that I mean this or that unreasonable thing is kind of pissing.
[08:24:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> namespace: This is #lesswrong, why would we ignore you when we could instead nerdsnipe ourselves by deconstructing your offhand tweets :p
[08:25:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, we're speculating that you mean this or that unreasonable thing because we have literally no clue what reasonable thing (or what thing at all) you could mean, clearly
[08:25:52] <aweinstock> Ralith: proving that some specific neural network weights (as a general floating point circuit) accomplishes some task seems harder than proving that some program in a more restricted logic accomplishes the same task
[08:26:18] <feep> namespace: I mean, I think "a cheap algorithm on top of neuromorphic" does have something for it imo
[08:26:48] <adiabatic> namespace: sorry bruh, we care about you too much to ignore you
[08:27:00] <Ralith> aweinstock: harder in the sense that type theory as it exists today in no way attempts to address this problem, yes :p
[08:27:13] <feep> like, someone, not sure who, did that paper where they were like "sufficiently large neural networks embed reinforcement learning", right?
[08:27:31] <Ralith> let alone the real thing, which is less "these specific weights do a thing" and more "this training procedure produces weights that do a thing"
[08:28:08] <feep> I think we'll find that we'll be doing larger and larger networks, but then we'll be able to pull scale back *out* of those networks as they learn things that really are obvious to compensate for algorithmic deficiencies
[08:28:27] <feep> I think gpt-3 may already be at scale or too large for general intelligence
[08:28:58] <feep> ie. hardware overhang
[08:29:12] <feep> but tbf I have no justification for this, it's just a feeling
[08:29:16] <spxtr> I doubt that
[08:29:34] <feep> spxtr: like, isn't the bitter lesson "we've algorithmically fallen behind compute"
[08:29:54] <feep> ie. compute scales better than algorithmic progress
[08:30:46] <feep> I think the maybe one remaining thing is that neural networks can't do learning at different timescales
[08:31:14] <feep> ie. short term/long term, and I think once we have short-term learning *during* long-term learning that'll turn training on its head
[08:31:44] <spxtr> maybe, but compute is still a major bottleneck
[08:31:54] <feep> sure, nobody's saying it's not
[08:32:07] <feep> that's what we'd expect to see if compute is scaling faster than research
[08:33:37] <spxtr> okay I think I understand what you're saying, but I still doubt the claim that gpt-3 may be at scale for general intelligence
[08:34:01] <feep> gpt-3 knows a ludicrous amount about the world, I think it knows more than any human.
[08:34:08] <saturn2> i thought the bitter lesson was that compute grows fast enough to overtake whatever special case bells and whistles you try to add
[08:34:15] <feep> yes
[08:34:26] <feep> spxtr: it needs to because it uses that info to compensate for its algorithmic deficiencies
[08:34:46] <feep> saturn2: the point is that we are slower at figuring out general intelligence than letting neural scale figure it out for us
[08:34:48] <spxtr> I believe that is true
[08:35:46] <saturn2> we haven't really figured out anything at all about general intelligence
[08:35:57] <spxtr> ^ that's basically the reason I doubt
[08:35:58] <feep> yeah but like
[08:36:02] <saturn2> so yeah, i guess that's slow
[08:36:10] <feep> with every new gpt generation, general intelligence looks less *impressive* to me.
[08:37:05] <feep> I think we'll go "oh, ai can't do that, well that's not general intelligence YET but" until we're right below it, and then there'll be one weird trick
[08:37:29] <adiabatic> didn't some guy with a screamingly jewish name say the same thing like a decade ago
[08:37:39] <feep> plausibly ^^
[08:42:54] <saturn2> definitely
[08:50:03] <spxtr> o geez vishy anand played a charity simul today. a unicorn startup ceo blatantly cheated against him, and probably quite a few of the other players probably cheated as well
[08:51:51] <spxtr> I fundamentally don't understand the mindset that leads someone to cheat in such a match
[08:52:15] <spxtr> it would be such an honor to play a game against anand, why would you spoil that by having a computer do it for you

[09:04:58] <namespace> It's fine, *in retrospect* that post was too vague to be useful anyway.
[09:08:14] <feep> exactly
[09:08:19] <feep> it was so enticing and mysterious
[09:08:32] <namespace> Right, which is why it had to be deleted, so you would shut the fuck up.
[09:08:46] <feep> "do better, YOU PEOPLE. Yes, you. You know who you are." like, I don't know who that is but now I *want* to know lol
[09:09:20] <feep> okay okay shutting up ^^
[09:12:38] <feep> anyway, to sum up my position on the AI safety thing
[09:12:58] <feep> we're nowhere close to understanding general intelligence, and that's really really bad, because it means we have no idea how close we are to achieving it.

For example, the effect of List.map depends on the effect of the function passed to it. That is, if List.map is given a pure function then computation is pure, whereas if it is given an impure function
[14:13:35] <dbohdan2> then computation is impure. As an another example, the effect of >> (forward function composition) depends on both of its arguments: composition is only pure if both its function arguments are pure.'  https://flix.dev/innovations/

[15:06:22] <feep[work]> which should let the docs be self-validating
[15:07:31] <rsaarelm> feep[work]: Just remembered. Advent of Code can be a great stress test for a new language. Someone on a programming channel picked up some obscure me too lisp project to do AoC with one year and was uncovering bugs each day.
[15:07:31] <feep[work]> unittests got added last week
[15:07:57] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: yeah :) though... those kinda have a tendency to be gmt tests more than language tests
[15:08:12] <feep[work]> gmp*
[15:08:34] <rsaarelm> Particularly if it isn't you doing the AoC, because you know too much about not punching the wobbly panels with the uninsulated high-voltage wire behind them with full force.
[15:08:34] <feep[work]> I think I did whatsitsface, uh, project euler for fcc
[15:09:23] <rsaarelm> And it's a lot easier to rope people into doing AoC than a big project on a weirdo language because the investment is few hours and done per day.

[15:10:53] <feep[work]> that's on the queue though
[15:11:04] <feep[work]> since they're pretty essential
[15:11:14] <rsaarelm> Yeah.
[15:11:36] <rsaarelm> Well, you can always rough it with assoc lists.
[15:11:48] <feep[work]> yeah but I don't want people to rough it in cx
[15:11:52] <feep[work]> that defeats the point entirely XD
[15:12:13] <feep[work]> adding a better-than-nothing hashmap macro should be easy anyway
[15:12:20] <rsaarelm> Yeah, if it's supposed to use hashmaps then it makes sense to wait.
[15:12:31] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: I mean, just looking at the first 2020 problem
[15:12:41] <feep[work]> that's like ... a "trivialized by hashmaps" type of problem :p
[15:13:09] <feep[work]> that's the sort of question where you go "well I tried not using hashmaps, but it was slow, then I added a hashmap and it was super fast"
[15:13:22] <feep[work]> might as well do it with hashmaps to start
[15:13:59] <rsaarelm> Well now I want to build cx and plug one solution with it in my language-agnostic AoC framework.
[15:14:23] <feep[work]> and I want syntax like ... auto a = set(x for x in [line.atoi for line in file.split("\n")]); to work for that

[15:18:25] <rsaarelm> Yeah, I'm seeing what happens when I run the build.sh from the release zip.
[15:18:31] <feep[work]> and so I put in a day or so of effort to get the C backend going as a release target
[15:18:37] *** sh0|tmp is now known as sh0
[15:18:40] <feep[work]> that is that
[15:21:22] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: um, note though that the release uses the C backend by default, and since I get weird crashes if I build with -O, it's kind of slow
[15:21:41] <feep[work]> you might want to rebuild it with llvm backend, I don't have a script for that but it's fairly easy
[15:22:05] <feep[work]> or don't bother I guess ^^
[15:28:23] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: so, any errors?
[15:30:41] <rsaarelm> feep[work]: Yeah, I got the binary, but how do I hello world? "file '.../hello.cx' is not in folder of any package"
[15:31:10] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: where are you calling from? the path gymnastics are a bit underdocumented
[15:31:19] <feep[work]> by default it searches in the current folder
[15:31:24] <rsaarelm> Same path as the file.
[15:31:30] <rsaarelm> Nothing else in htere.
[15:31:32] <feep[work]> cx hello.cx *should* work o.o
[15:32:03] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: oh!
[15:32:27] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: the script made cx in build/cx, right?
[15:32:57] <rsaarelm> Hold on...
[15:33:32] <rsaarelm> I unpacked to /tmp/cx, did cd /tmp/cx; ./build.sh and got /tmp/cx/cx binary.
[15:33:46] <rsaarelm> There's no build/ subdir.
[15:33:47] <feep[work]> okay, that could ... hang on
[15:33:52] <feep[work]> yeah hang on, that's only locally
[15:34:06] * feep[work] chews lip
[15:34:21] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: well, I didn't think you'd find a bug THAT early :v
[15:34:23] <rsaarelm> Oh, I copied the binary elsewhere and ran it from there.
[15:34:30] <feep[work]> oh yeah that can not work for multiple reasons
[15:34:37] <rsaarelm> If I run the /tmp/cx/cx binary now I get a different error
[15:34:41] <feep[work]> yay
[15:35:02] <feep[work]> (the binary uses its realpath as the root of its package search)
[15:36:03] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: what's the different error?
[15:39:56] <rsaarelm> Hadn't externed print. Now I did "import std.string;" and "extern(C) void print(string);" and main with 'print("Hello, world!\n")' and it segfaults.
[15:40:03] <rsaarelm> I mean the compiler, not the binary.
[15:40:32] <rsaarelm> (Should we take this to some overflow channel?)
[15:41:13] <feep[work]> gimme like 5m, standup at work
[15:44:03] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: I can half guess what that is ... there were some bugs that got fixed the day after 0.0.1
[15:44:18] <feep[work]> gimme a gdb anyway?
[15:44:49] <feep[work]> or else I can just dump out a 0.0.2, now that I have a script for it it should go quick~

[20:33:42] <two2thehead> basically if an idlerpg requires you to not play it, then you could joke that you are playing it by not playing it
[20:34:01] <dbohdan> two2thehead: Not a bad joke :-)

[20:35:27] <dbohdan> He is "offline"
[20:35:43] <shawwwn> ded, got it

[20:36:18] <dbohdan> He is stuck "IRL" or in "meatspace"

[20:39:57] <Robomot> FireEye has been hacked, and their red team tools stolen. They've released the detection/countermeasures on their GitHub! : netsec
[20:40:13] <PapuaHardyNet> old news, but interesting set of tools
[20:40:58] <ggreer> even the slide is 3d printed. only the barrel and a few internals are metal. also he used some sort of tungsten expoxy to get enough weight for the simple blowback mechanism
[20:40:59] <PapuaHardyNet> i wonder how to get the red team tools now
[20:41:07] <ggreer> *mass
[20:42:48] <Logos01> ggreer: I've been saying for *years* now that gun control is slowly but surely going the way of the dodo.
[20:43:41] <ggreer> he also credits slow mo footage (probably from his phone) for helping troubleshoot and understand certain aspects of his gun
[20:44:01] <ggreer> looks like he's a software engineer working for amazon and he does this sort of thing as a hobby
[20:44:12] <two2thehead> ggreer, that is an unusual setup, to say the least O_o
[20:44:40] <dbohdan> Logos01: If 3D-printed guns became even somewhat common, I'd fully expect a country like the UK to start requiring a mandatory license for 3D printing
[20:44:54] <ggreer> oi you got a license for that printer?
[20:45:08] <dbohdan> *loicense
[20:46:28] <ggreer> I know someone has constructed a 3d printed gun in europe using no illegal/restricted parts (including ammo). obviously constructing the gun is illegal, but the components are available to anyone
[20:46:39] <Logos01> ggreer: I like the scifi-ness of the circular formfactor for the magazine though.
[20:46:51] <ggreer> yeah it's impractical but it's cool as hell

[20:48:17] <kuudes> in the anom bust they caught at least 1 3d gun mill here in finland
[20:48:37] <ggreer> neat
[20:48:42] <Logos01> ggreer: I mean I've actually heard of 40-round magazines in the past without being jutting out of the pistol.
[20:48:48] <Logos01> But yeah.
[20:49:07] <ggreer> I have some 33rd mags for my glock. they're... pretty long. they stick way out of the pistol
[20:49:56] <Logos01> No I mean the double-width magazines that I've heard of.
[20:50:16] <ggreer> glock mags are double stack

[20:50:36] <Logos01> "This you have to spend like 5 minutes to reload, but who cares? It's *siiick*" <-- correct priorities.
[20:51:18] <ggreer> yep
[20:51:30] <Logos01> ggreer: I mean really it's two thirds of the way to a drum magazine already.
[20:52:15] <ggreer> the neat thing is that there are no springs. the action of the pistol rotates the ring and loads the next round
[20:52:49] <nshepperd> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemical_machining crazy cool honestly
[20:52:50] <Robomot> Electrochemical machining - Wikipedia (Electrochemical machining (ECM) is a method of removing metal by an electrochemical process. It is normally used for mass production and is used for working extremely hard materials or materials that are difficult to machine using conventional methods.[1] Its use is limited to electrically conductive materials. …)
[20:53:35] <Logos01> ggreer: Fair 'nuff, yeah.
[20:53:57] <dbohdan> I like how the video's description emphasizes this is not the same thing as a drum magazine
[20:54:39] <vorpalhex> re double width - do you mean the double-double-stack design Keltec uses on the P33? It's a neat little design
[20:54:59] <vorpalhex> 33 rounds of 22 in a normal sized mag

[20:57:31] <Logos01> vorpalhex: Of course not. But you've missed the lurch there.
[20:58:00] <Logos01> The double-stack designs *look* like lower capacity magazines to the uninformed.
[20:58:14] <feep> three cheers for kde's android integration and "incoming call" notification

[20:59:15] <nshepperd> nice
[20:59:20] <Logos01> ggreer: That being said, I feel like you could do better with the ring's capacity by double-walling it.

[20:59:57] <Logos01> feep: "If it weren't for my horse, I never would have graduated college" <-- your last statement reads a little like that.
[20:59:57] <feep> then they called me and were like "wanna get vaccinated right now" and I was like "I WILL BE THERE IN FIVE"
[21:00:11] <feep> Logos01: ^^
[21:00:16] <feep> but ... I was there in ten

[21:00:59] <Logos01> Though you'd probably want extra measures to reduce friction on the motion.
[21:01:08] <feep> dbohdan: highly worrying, but master might be broken rn
[21:01:34] <feep> dbohdan: oh no that's an older one, I probably rebased it away and didn't update the bootstrap file properly
[21:01:46] <feep> dbohdan: I'll fix it once I've fixed the current crash issue.
[21:02:02] <dbohdan> Ah, okay
[21:03:25] <feep> yeah that's maybe two weeks ago, I think I last did a full clean rebuild a month or so ago
[21:03:47] <nshepperd> shawwwn: i think it may also be useful to graph the root mean square of the singular values
[21:03:50] <Logos01> dbohdan: The trouble with the licensing of 3d printers is that it's getting easier and easier to produce 3d printers.

[21:05:47] <nshepperd> that should represent how much a typical vector will be scaled

[21:06:19] <nshepperd> i did that and noticed a lot of them were less than 0.5 which makes me wonder if my weight decay is too much
[21:06:24] <Logos01> kuudes: Ubiquity of supply, especially in areas like where you live.
[21:06:35] <kuudes> possession is a crime though?
[21:06:43] <Logos01> kuudes: My point in mentioning this is that gun control is based on the premise that guns are hard to obtain.
[21:06:49] <Logos01> Over time that's going to change.
[21:07:15] <kuudes> hard to obtain for who?
[21:07:34] <Logos01> Plebians.
[21:07:50] <shawwwn> nshepperd: why that instead of just svd?
[21:08:22] <Logos01> kuudes: The *point* is that over time it will be less and less effective to prevent criminals from using guns because it will be easier and easier for them to obtain them in order to commit crimes.
[21:08:23] <nshepperd> you can't plot the svd, it's a whole vector
[21:08:41] <kuudes> but there is only a closed set of criminals?
[21:08:49] <nshepperd> as big as your nn's internal layers dimension
[21:08:53] <Logos01> kuudes: Irrelevant.
[21:10:34] <kuudes> I don't understand. anyone about knows the hells angels have guns. and when the police wants to bust them, they go to their quarters and turn it upside down and arrest everyone for illegal possession

[21:14:43] <vorpalhex> Logos01: (sorry for being slow to respond) most 10 round and 15+ round magazines are identical - they're the same mag but a different follower for state compliance.
[21:15:07] <vorpalhex> Usually magazines have a minimum physical length dictated by the grip (in the case of a pistol)
[21:15:32] <nshepperd> obtaining guns to commit crimes is not quite equal to getting away with commiting such crimes
[21:17:00] <kuudes> I suppose if there were suddenly way more crimes we could need to build more prisons or something
[21:17:05] <PapuaHardyNet> are 3d printed guns really lethal?
[21:17:31] <vorpalhex> PapuaHardyNet: Yes, usually just the restricted parts are 3d printed, but the barrel/etc are normal firearm parts
[21:18:06] <kuudes> don't you need permit for those as well
[21:18:42] <kuudes> I mean, I don't recall seeing gun parts in a regular hardware store, but then again I haven't been to hardware stores that much recently
[21:19:33] <kuudes> I guess I don't see what is the threatening demand in this
[21:19:39] <vorpalhex> nope, it's just metal bits, in the US it's the receiver that is restricted
[21:19:54] <vorpalhex> most of the parts are very easily made, so impossible to restrict, and aren't themselves dangerous
[21:19:56] <kuudes> sure but in usa you are allowed to buy guns with intent to use against people
[21:20:12] <vorpalhex> you aren't allowed to buy with the intent to commit a crime
[21:20:18] <vorpalhex> and you have to go through an FBI background check
[21:20:40] <kuudes> over here you are not allowed to have the intent to use a gun against people unless you are police or military or a couple of rare exceptions
[21:21:07] <kuudes> ie no home defence guns etc
[21:21:39] <kuudes> and you are required to store your legal guns in special lockers that take long to open, the time limit being there to protect humans from your guns, also criminals
[21:22:03] <kuudes> ie you do not have an inherent right to a gun
[21:22:25] <kuudes> and police can take away your guns if they deem you are no longer an upstanding citizen
[21:22:32] <two2thehead> this sounds like something that should be in #lw-politics
[21:23:34] <PapuaHardyNet> no inherent right to guns eh

[21:28:35] <feep> lemme get it back up to master and confirm it works, then I'll push 0.0.2 (again)
[21:30:41] <dbohdan> Oops, it's failed with "/home/dbohdan/software/Cx/src/std/file.cx:15:10: error: assert not found".  Maybe I found the wrong commit.
[21:31:19] <feep> dbohdan: no that is in fact the bug in master
[21:31:27] <feep> that I mentioned earlier :)
[21:31:42] <ggreer> to get a gun in california, I had to get fingerprinted, get a background check, take a written test (it was super easy but cost $25), demonstrate safe handling of a firearm, provide two forms of government-issued identification, provide two recent utility bills to prove that I still lived at the address on my ID, then wait 10 days
[21:31:56] <feep> dbohdan: honestly I'm just amazed it managed to bootstrap that far at all
[21:32:03] <feep> this is a significant validation of the bootstrap approach
[21:32:08] <ggreer> oh and the guns you can buy in california are on a whitelist and it's stupid specific. eg: gen 3 glocks are ok but gen 4 glocks aren't
[21:32:43] <dbohdan> feep: It *is* impressive, given the sheer number of steps
[21:33:06] <ggreer> lastly even after all that, at some point I was barred from being able to buy ammo because... I'm not sure. maybe I moved and some address didn't get updated in some system? anyway I failed CA's background check (which they require for every ammo purchase)
[21:33:25] <dbohdan> ggreer: Is there an actual difference between the Glock generations?
[21:33:36] * dbohdan predicts: not really
[21:33:47] <ggreer> some parts are different. also the grip on some generations has finger grooves
[21:34:09] <ggreer> I think they added another pin on the gen 4 glocks to improve long-term reliability
[21:34:17] <ggreer> 3 pins around the locking block instead of 2
[21:34:44] <ggreer> magazines are compatible across generations though, as are many other internal parts
[21:35:01] <two2thehead> ggreer, wait *two* forms of govt issued ID? that seems tough to do when the USGOVT doesn't have a national ID, to my knowledge
[21:35:07] <dbohdan> I guess long-term reliability is not acceptable in California
[21:35:23] <ggreer> two2thehead: IIRC, yeah. I had my passport and CA driver's license
[21:35:29] <two2thehead> ah, okay
[21:35:38] <ggreer> they want to ban guns but they can't ban guns, so they make it as inconvenient as possible
[21:35:48] <kuudes> oh yeah, I should renew my id card
[21:35:48] <ggreer> similar to red states that want to ban abortion but can't ban abortion
[21:35:52] * two2thehead was wondering. "I have my national ID and my passport... So what's the third alternative?"
[21:36:06] <kuudes> driving licence?
[21:36:22] <two2thehead> yeah, driving license could be I guess
[21:36:49] <two2thehead> my point being, lack of national ID may lead to some weird private sector work-arounds for id checking
[21:37:18] <kuudes> well, over here electronic identification is semiprivatized
[21:37:38] <two2thehead> apparently estonia has excellent digital governance models
[21:37:46] <kuudes> ie mostly it is banks and telcos that provide identification of people, the police only does the primary identification, ie passport etc

[21:41:02] <two2thehead> I think they should use your library card as identification :^)
[21:44:30] *** mjr_ is now known as mjr
[21:46:21] <dbohdan> feep: To be honest, *I* wouldn't even think to bootstrap this early.  It is interesting to watch you do it, and I admire the approach for its purity, but to me it would feel like pessimizing my workflow.  I'd get to something like an alpha version and only then rewrite the compiler in itself.  (Or, depending on the purpose of the language, I wouldn't rewrite it in itself at all.  This could be a sign of a deeper philosophical difference.)
[21:50:09] <feep> dbohdan: yeah I specifically raced to bootstrapping
[21:50:38] <feep> dbohdan: there's a reason for it though
[21:50:45] <feep> dbohdan: also please pull and reset to origin master
[21:51:12] <feep> dbohdan: anyway, the reason is that you need bootstrapping for a halfway efficient macro compiler
[21:51:39] <feep> because you need to be able to compile your own code during compiletime *anyway*, so you have macro support, so you might as well compile yourself all the way
[21:55:48] <feep> and like ... macro support is why I made this compiler, it's its entire justification for existing.
[21:55:53] <feep> so hence, self-hosting~

[22:15:32] <feep> probably won't make a difference but may randomly work? backtrace support should be optional.
[22:19:17] <rsaarelm> Okay, let's see.
[22:25:22] <rsaarelm> Still segfaults.
[22:27:30] <feep> crud.
[22:27:57] <feep> rsaarelm: yeah at this point it would be great if you could make a docker image that repros, if you have the free time
[22:28:05] <rsaarelm> Looking into that next.
[22:28:10] <feep> maybe it's a gcc version difference, I think this code is a bit fiddly anyways
[22:28:18] <feep> I know it falls over if I -O it
[22:29:15] <dbohdan> feep: Right, your compiler is pretty unusual because of how extensive the macros are.  I'd still try to avoid bootstraping it early, but I'd also choose to bootstrap if the complexity of avoiding it started to seem too high.
[22:29:38] <feep> right
[22:29:53] <dbohdan> feep: I get "/home/dbohdan/software/Cx/src/std/string.cx:104:2: error: lhs null".  Do I need to delete .obj and re-bootstrap from scratch?
[22:30:01] <feep> woah how
[22:30:12] <feep> dbohdan: .obj won't force rebootstrapping, so go for it
[22:30:28] <dbohdan> feep: I pulled, `git reset --hard`, `bash bootstrap.sh`
[22:30:29] <feep> bootstrap runs are totally separate from your existing source folder
[22:30:38] <feep> so that should be safe anyways
[22:30:52] <feep> ie. just rm -rf .obj and rebootstrap, it should only rerun the latest step
[22:31:26] <feep> !!!
[22:31:32] <dbohdan> Still the same error
[22:31:40] <feep> rsaarelm: I may have a repro, if I -O it and then run with valgrind, I get the same typeFmtInternal crash site
[22:32:02] <feep> so it might work randomly due to a messed up struct initialization
[22:32:23] <dbohdan> Err, I probably pulled early
[22:32:25] <rsaarelm> The Alpine Docker image seems to crunch the hello.cx instead of crashing like my host OS...
[22:32:36] <dbohdan> I've pulled again and got new commits
[22:32:53] <feep> dbohdan: master should have a tag 0.0.2
[22:33:14] <feep> rsaarelm: so yeah I bet this is the struct 0 initialization, I thought that was a bit iffy
[22:33:44] <feep> I'mma try to hotpatch that in the C dump, see if that fixes it
[22:34:44] <dbohdan> feep: *Now* it does
[22:35:07] <rsaarelm> There does seem to be a NixOS dockerfile, let's see what that's like...
[22:35:12] <rsaarelm> * docker image
[22:35:21] <feep> rsaarelm: I have a repro~
[22:35:29] <feep> I mean, have fun if you like
[22:35:32] <rsaarelm> Great.
[22:35:56] <feep> just trying to track it down to a C backend instr
[22:39:38] *** Joins: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470)
[22:42:03] <dbohdan> feep: Yay, it has built.  50/50 successful tests.
[22:42:25] <feep> dbohdan: \o/!!
[22:42:51] <feep> at least that backend is reliable
[22:43:25] <dbohdan> This is on Ubuntu 20.04 with glibc

[22:54:02] <feep> tracing the uninitialized value... thank god for valgrind
[22:57:16] * feep stares
[22:57:19] <feep> might be an alignment issue...?
[23:00:48] <feep> char[20] is only a pointer if it's a parameter argument, right? it's 20 bytes in a struct?
[23:03:58] <feep> weh, I'll just jam an __attribute__((aligned)) at the end
[23:04:26] <PapuaHardyNet> I bet reading the trials of feep as he builds a new language would be really interesting
[23:04:35] <feep> WELL YOU ARE IN LUCK
[23:04:51] <PapuaHardyNet> :P
[23:05:48] <PapuaHardyNet> I wasn't being sarcastic though. I imagine a blog or a git commit log where you write random notes about the problems you faced, why they occurred, and what cool things you implemented
[23:06:41] <PapuaHardyNet> on that note
[23:06:50] <PapuaHardyNet> do you have a public git repository for cx?
[23:12:58] <rsaarelm> PapuaHardyNet:  https://github.com/FeepingCreature/Cx
[23:12:58] <Robomot> GitHub - FeepingCreature/Cx: C with macros - well, let's be honest, D1 with macros. Pre-pre-alpha. (C with macros - well, let's be honest, D1 with macros. Pre-pre-alpha. - FeepingCreature/Cx)
[23:13:39] <dbohdan> feep: I've written a program in Cx -- or rather, I have ported one from Tcl.  PR incoming.

[23:16:25] <Robomot> test: add test/runnable/sparkline.cx by dbohdan · Pull Request #1 · FeepingCreature/Cx · GitHub (This test is a port of https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Sparkline.  You can use the code I am contributing however you like and relicense it under any license.)
[23:16:39] <feep> dbohdan: aaaaaaaa
[23:16:56] <feep> dbohdan: lemme do five more minutes of debugging the rsaarelm issue first pls!! so many exciting things are happening
[23:17:26] <dbohdan> feep: Sure!  No rush. <3
[23:20:44] <feep> --- fuck, hang on, hang on
[23:20:50] <feep> does struct {} have a minimum size in C
[23:23:34] <dbohdan> feep: GCC permits empty (sizeof == 0) structs as an extension
[23:23:55] <feep> right, good
[23:24:02] * feep studs the code with printfs
[23:26:03] <feep> it seems it's assigning a struct, but it's skipping a field
[23:26:10] <feep> but like ... this can't really be a gcc bug, can it
[23:26:14] <feep> nah.
[23:27:12] <feep> ... adding the printfs changed the error
[23:27:14] <feep> WHY DO YOU DO THIS ;.;
[23:28:15] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: have you thought of using musl instead of gcc (if applicable, of course)?
[23:28:23] <feep> how does musl substitute for gcc..
[23:29:32] <feep> I think I need to maybe use unions instead of pointer casts
[23:29:39] <feep> I feel storing data inside a char[] is a bridge too far for gcc
[23:30:11] <PapuaHardyNet> aren't you compiling a cx compiler / interpreter using gcc?
[23:30:21] <feep>  yes
[23:30:58] <PapuaHardyNet> well, as far as I've read, musl can do the same job, and has less bugs
[23:31:03] <feep> musl is not a substitute for gcc
[23:31:13] <PapuaHardyNet> i see :?
[23:31:17] <feep> you might be mixing up gcc with glibc
[23:31:33] <PapuaHardyNet> you are right, that was dumb
[23:31:45] <PapuaHardyNet> but wait
[23:31:55] <PapuaHardyNet> I have musl-clang and musl-gcc on my system
[23:32:17] <feep> yeah, cause you need a libc to link c 
[23:32:18] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps you can use musl-gcc instead of gcc?
[23:32:25] <feep> that's still gcc, and won't help
[23:32:27] <feep> this is not a glibc issue
[23:32:47] <feep> this is probably some sort of aliasing optimization issue
[23:33:29] <Logos01> Well this blows monkey-chunks.  The owner of the house I'm renting just posted a notice of eviction for the end of next month because they're intending to sell the house.
[23:33:30] <rsaarelm> Good thing you got it reproing because I finally got the nixos dockerfile running and it just compiles everything fine.
[23:33:32] <Logos01> The notice indicated that I would get first right to purchase the property instead of moving out but my fiasco with not working for so long means I have bupkiss for savings.
[23:34:22] <feep> haha yes
[23:34:51] <feep> rsaarelm: please edit build.sh and add -Ofast -no-strict-aliasing
[23:35:22] <feep> -fno-strict-aliasing*
[23:35:56] <rsaarelm> Trying that...
[23:36:23] <feep> (because we do Horrible Pointer Casts in the C backend)
[23:37:45] <feep> like, I think casting char[20] to void**
[23:37:48] <feep> was just a bridge too far for gcc
[23:38:28] <rsaarelm> feep: Okay, now it's making noise instead of immediately segfaulting.
[23:38:31] <feep> yay!
[23:39:06] <dbohdan> Logos01: Could you take out a mortgage and repay it fairly quickly?
[23:39:21] <rsaarelm> Got my hello world!
[23:39:25] <feep> \o/
[23:40:06] <dbohdan> Logos01: (If it makes sense for you to buy the house.)

[23:40:47] <Robomot> Why on Earth did Facebook Just Acquire Mapillary? | by Joe Morrison | Medium (Disclaimer: the views I express in my personal blog are just that: personal. They aren’t endorsed by my employer, my mother, my lawyer, or anyone else for that matter. The big news in the geospatial…)
[23:40:52] <feep> Logos01: damn that sucks, sorry.
[23:41:59] <two2thehead> "This is a strategy known as “commoditizing your complement,” that I first read about in an excellent article from the mysterious internet journalist/researcher Gwern. Essentially, if you’re getting your ass handed to you by a competitor with a software or data advantage you can’t replicate yourself, you can use permissive licensing as a weapon to erode that advantage by encouraging the world to collaborate with you. Google itsel
[23:41:59] <two2thehead> f is no stranger to this strategy; their choice to acquire Android and support it as a free and open operating system for smartphones is an example of this tactic. In that instance, the complement was Apple and iOS."
[23:42:44] <PapuaHardyNet> so facebook is fighting against google maps monopoly?
[23:43:32] <two2thehead> augmented reality/virtual reality apparently
[23:43:48] <feep> isn't that from whatshisface
[23:43:53] <Logos01> dbohdan: Mortgage payments would be cheaper than my rent but not by much.
[23:43:58] <feep> oh lolg
[23:43:59] <feep> lol
[23:44:05] <feep> gwern: your article ranks higher on google than joel's
[23:44:26] <Logos01> That being said, I turned forty a couple weeks ago so I don't know about getting a standard 30-year-fixed.
[23:44:42] <Logos01> If I did, I would be able to pay it off easily enough in well less than that.
[23:47:07] * feep immediately tags 0.0.3 lol
[23:48:30] <feep> rsaarelm: ignore 0.0.3, that's just the build.sh change
[23:48:46] *** Joins: Guest995 (~Guest9@103.249.234.176)
[23:49:06] <PapuaHardyNet> Logos01: What's so bad about a "standard 30-year-fixed"? serious question. (I don't know much about mortgages btw)
[23:49:43] <feep> dbohdan: neat~ should maybe go in demos/ though
[23:49:52] <PapuaHardyNet> is it the idea of having to continually pay for the house for 30 years until one is 70? I do find that a painful idea
[23:49:57] <feep> also I should add min() and max() to the listcomprehensions
[23:50:11] <feep> dbohdan: swap it to demos, and I'll merge and rewrite it a bit to be cuter?
[23:50:15] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: listcomprehensions in a C-like? that's sacrilege!
[23:50:18] <feep> mwahaha
[23:50:23] <feep> we were a D-like all along!
[23:50:26] <Logos01> PapuaHardyNet: I would be 70 by the time the mortgage was completed, and retirement age is usually 65.
[23:50:36] <Logos01> Meaning I would be expected to continue paying mortgage after retirement.
[23:51:29] <feep> dbohdan: also this is a good candidate for something to be a separate package once I write package support in two weeks over summer holiday
[23:52:05] <PapuaHardyNet> right, that is an unfair burden
[23:52:54] <PapuaHardyNet> and you aren't confident about paying it off easily in a lesser amount of time, which is why you don't want to take the 30 year mortgage
[23:53:02] <feep> dbohdan: also I'mma switch to some bsd-like probably, gpl is not worth the license uncertainty
[23:53:14] <PapuaHardyNet> yes, BSD sounds good
[23:53:24] <Logos01> PapuaHardyNet: I mean I almost certainly *could* but that's a different conversation.
[23:53:58] <ggreer> Logos01: isn't the idea that you'd sell the house before then to downsize/move to a place where you'd retire?
[23:55:20] <Logos01> ggreer: If you own the property outright that's less of an issue.
[23:55:49] <Logos01> 'cause like I could *probably* live at my current lifestyle just off of SSI if I didn't have to pay a mortgage/rent
[23:56:02] <PapuaHardyNet> what's SSI
[23:56:05] <dbohdan> feep: All right, I'm moving it to demos/ and giving it a CLI like in the Tcl version.  Give me a moment to figure this out.
[23:56:07] <Logos01> social security income
[23:56:20] <Logos01> Err, insurance.
[23:56:21] <Logos01> But yeah.
[23:56:23] <feep> dbohdan: make the cli a separate module maybe, this looks fun as a library
[23:56:32] <dbohdan> feep: All right
[23:57:39] <Logos01> PapuaHardyNet: As to the ability I may or may not have to pay off my mortgage ... conservative guesstimates under "acceptable" outcome scenarios put my networth in five years at around $3M USD.
[23:57:54] <Logos01> But that's value that I won't be able to touch *until* five years from now, and may not pan out at all.
[23:58:19] <Logos01> Assuming Zillow is correct about my current home's property value it would be ~$440k
