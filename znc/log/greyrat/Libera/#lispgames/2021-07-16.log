[15:25:53] <ln43> anyone here likes sudoku (or is it considered a too simple game?) 
[15:28:25] <pjb> ln43: well, I never solved a sudoku myself.  but I wrote a program to solve them.  So, basically, not interresting. http://informatimago.com/develop/lisp/com/informatimago/small-cl-pgms/sudoku-solver/index.html
[15:28:50] <pjb> ln43: a lot of brain teasers have become uninteresting with the advent of computers.
[15:38:54] <ln43> yes me too i'm not solving it directly and the program was found as a bonus from an external source
[15:40:44] <ln43> yes but there are different possible solution strategies.. it's not so immediate at least for me (because this is my first "sudoku day")
[15:42:53] <ln43> yes but low quality code with off-by-1 errors for the board to say

[18:40:46] <manicennui> I don't find things boring just because computers can do them.
[18:41:02] <manicennui> That attitude seems strange to me.
[18:42:29] <manicennui> Pretty sure computers could play nearly all video games better than people.
[18:44:13] <manicennui> Which is basically what hacks are for FPSes.
[18:46:27] <pjb> manicennui: well, perhaps not boring per se, but definitely deadly.  If you improve on doing something computers can do better, you're not improving on doing what humans can do better, and you will be eliminated from the workforce and the gene pool…
[18:46:49] <manicennui> We are talking about games...
[18:46:52] <pjb> Playing is serious matter.
[18:47:02] <manicennui> heh

[20:24:55] * |3b| thinks optimizing for suitability to "the workforce" is a depressing concept :(
[20:27:25] <aeth> Sudoku isn't fun for me, but ksudoku has Sudokus that I do find fun... the larger ones that combine 4-5 Sudokus in one.
[20:27:45] <aeth> it's great to see everything come together at the end
[20:28:08] <mfiano> Write an animated WFC algorithm, which is basically a sudoku solver on steroids
[20:28:23] <thrig> or write a shooter where you blow up the sudoku numbers
[20:28:42] <aeth> also, the whole reason why people play freecell and sudoku and stuff is because 'the workforce' is mostly wasting their time at work instead of cutting hours to just the optimal workweek
[20:29:04] <aeth> thrig: sudoku but you have to hit the correct number or else you get sniped... would be incredibly difficult
[20:32:05] <thrig> easier puzzles can be done in your head. the harder stuff requires notes
[20:33:46] <|3b|> hmm, a game where enemies of various types (support,defense,attack,etc) are placed by sudoku rules in an obscured grid, and you have to get rid of the attack types within a limited number of shots? 
[20:34:12] <|3b|> cross between sudoku,minesweeper,and battleships
[20:37:42] <edgar-rft> what about the Return of the Sodoku Zombies?
[20:42:50] <edgar-rft> ...and Sodoku vs. Godzilla?

[21:19:06] <pjb> Well, I guess you could always make things like sudoku "interesting" by involving a life threatening element, like say, in the movies Cube, Cube³ and Hypercube…
[21:20:20] <pjb> Well, that was Cube, Cube Zero, and Cube²: Hypercube
[21:20:39] <pjb> And they plan to make a new Cube in 2021..
[21:20:56] <pjb> (Japanese remake; that should be interesting).
[21:21:36] <pjb> So, imagine a sudoku, where you'd have to move to rooms to set the numbers right, and if set it wrong or are blocked, some destructive event occurs.
[21:22:04] <pjb> Then you can have a sequel with a 3D sudoku…
[21:22:17] <pjb> and competion people.
