[02:42:12] <hpc> i have two songs that vlc on my phone absolutely refuses to play at the correct volume, no matter how hard i try
[02:42:52] <hpc> and vlc on my computer plays them properly
[02:43:16] <hpc> except for reporting the times incorrectly, when the song ends it's saying 6:21 out of 6:15 :(

[02:46:12] <hpc> i am beginning to sympathize with the unsubstantiated "i only use mpv 6.8 because blah blah blah" audiophiles
[02:46:20] <hpc> because who even knows anymore
[02:47:24] <monochrom> I am unsympathetic towards audiophiles.
[02:48:00] <monochrom> But I am sympathetic to version freezing for fear of showstopper bugs like those.
[02:48:48] <hpc> everything worked great on google play music before the patched out the ability to PLAY MUSIC FROM IT
[02:48:53] <janus> isn't it just because of variable bit rate? why would the decoder need to decode every frame to figure out the exact length of the track
[02:49:11] <janus> probably formats lets the header specify it and then some encoders just put wrong data in there
[02:49:15] <hpc> why would it say how long the track is if it's just going to lie?
[02:49:37] <janus> because it would be wasteful to decode all frames to tell you the exact actual length. better just trust the encoder
[02:49:50] <monochrom> https://www.audioasylum.com/forums/pcaudio/messages/11/119979.html was the last straw to me.
[02:50:37] <hpc> "audio asylum" is right
[02:51:17] <hpc> (https://duckduckgo.com/Lunatic_asylum?ia=web for non-english speakers)
[02:51:21] <janus> hpc: you could just decode the file to wav, then maybe the length will fit. and you can use unix `du` to find the length in seconds with a bit of napkin math ;)

[02:52:58] <hpc> (also the etymology of "lunatic" is pretty silly)
[02:53:48] <hpc> janus: i figured it would use the random access index
[02:53:59] <hpc> since it's pretty wasteful to scan the whole file to get to the last 30 seconds too :P
[02:54:06] <monochrom> Yeah I'm inclined to "a buggy program made the file". Music/Video length is like UTF-8 codepoint count, you cache the answer or you spend linear time again and again.
[02:54:39] <hpc> then the index has to be right, or basic behavior breaks even if you aren't looking at it
[02:54:45] <hpc> and you get correctness that way instead
[02:55:30] <janus> well the second->frame table could be fine and the 'track length in seconds' number could be wrong 
[02:55:30] <hpc> maybe if i just look at how mp3 works all will be made clear

[14:48:35] <arahael> Rembane: I might even cut the earbuds off, as I really just need the plug.
[14:48:55] <arahael> Plug flips a mechanical switch inside the port, I think, if I recall correctly.
[14:50:49] <Rembane> arahael: I think you might need a closed loop with a resistance on, but you can build that in so many ways. One of the fancier ones is two LEDs, one for each channel.
[14:51:53] <Rembane> The LEDs need one resistor each, but that's an implementation detail. :)
[14:54:46] <arahael> Rembane: Too much work, I'm a software dude, and I dislike LEDs - but that's a neat idea, actually. It _would_ give a pretty good indication of when the speaker's in use...
