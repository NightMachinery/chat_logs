[07:16:34] <pe> I have.

[07:21:03] <pe> You just need the whole cross-compiler suite.
[07:21:24] <pe> Which is a few programs actually.
[07:22:07] <technomancy> Teckla: gcc-mingw-w64-i686 is the one I used... maybe also a glibc? it's been a few years so I'm a bit fuzzy but you at least need glibc
[07:22:11] <technomancy> *at least gcc
[07:22:27] <pe> It will pick up the correct libc automatically.
[07:23:16] <pe> There may be a support library necessary on the target, not sure.
[07:23:32] <Teckla> I'm guessing this ... "mingw-w64 - Development environment targeting 32- and 64-bit Windows" ... is the right package and will include everything

[16:52:43] <bsandro> i got my current se2020 back when lockdowns started so didn't even carry around that much
[16:52:57] <bsandro> it just lies here on the table 99% of the time
[16:53:02] <pe> Yeah, I haven't managed to damage my phones visibly either.
[16:53:10] <bsandro> one of the speakers is almost dead already, battery holds for maybe a day

[16:53:38] <wink> but I am SO HAPPY that I chose a simple cheap one
[16:53:59] <wink> maybe after the pandemic the time is right for a fancy phone :P
[16:54:11] <pe> The last time I broke a phone was when I forcibly threw my Nokia 3410 in the air on a lanyard, and it fell back down onto a random chunk of concrete. Which was solved by duck tape.
[16:54:51] <bsandro> i remember my nexus 4x backplate glass shattered when I placed it down after a call
[16:54:52] <wink> when the iphones were new and the accelerometer was an actual new feature..
[16:55:00] <vladimyr> Presumably concrete never recovered from that one?
[16:55:28] <pe> Actually, my Nokia N70 just broke its own display while laying in my bag. No idea what happened.
[16:55:32] <vladimyr> bsandro: ouch
[16:55:37] <wink> I suggested to a coworker (on a work hack day) to write an app called 'iThrow' where you could do highscores fo who dared to throw and catch their iphone ot a higher height
[16:55:45] <bsandro> yeah it shattered because of temperature difference instantly
[16:55:58] <wink> he actually did it, to my surprise. but he only tested on grass, up to 30cm
[16:56:18] <bsandro> also funny how I've read dozens of books on Motorola C650 back in uni - tiny 128x128 px screen
[16:56:50] <bsandro> now i have 500 inch devices but I'm reading not that often :C

[16:57:45] <bsandro> wink: should add that to hall of fame apps, like those that added wireless charging in microwave

[19:35:38] <iDrougge> JSON for inter-program communication feels a bit like printing the output and then OCRing it into the next part of the pipe.
[19:35:53] <pe> Something like that.
[19:37:17] <jkaye> Shells with pipes bound explicitly by structural typing would be cool. I don't think I'd use JSON but for me that would be the next evolution of shells. I'm sure someone has built something like that already
[19:37:52] <Brekkjern> Hey guys, have you heard of the lord and saviour, PowerShell?
[19:38:33] <pe> killall Brekkjern
[19:38:38] <vladimyr> *nushell
[19:39:54] <riv> I use powershell when on windows :)
[19:40:01] <riv> not really scripted with it, but it seems nice
[19:40:05] <reneeontheweb> yeah I just feel like that's against the grain of shells in general? like the whole point is the type of a program spawned by the shell is it's just a text stream, if there's a type system on top there's a whole new thing where they need to make their types visible and/or negotiate some interface contract etc
[19:40:26] <riv> we don't need to use JSON but *something* that is formally defined and parsable with a single algorithm would be nice
[19:40:29] <Brekkjern> It's not a text stream. It's a byte stream that often happens to be encoded in ASCII
[19:40:43] <riv> having to write a custom parser for every programs output is a misfeature imo
[19:43:20] <vladimyr> riv: https://github.com/kellyjonbrazil/jc

[19:43:31] <riv> :O
[19:43:35] <riv> that's a nice solution
[19:44:12] <iDrougge> reneeontheweb: I don’t see why my shell should be less expressive than my code editor.
[19:44:12] <reneeontheweb> oh hey that's sweet yeah
[19:45:04] <iDrougge> And that’s how we arrived here: By »solving« problems instead of removing the problem category altogether.

[19:46:24] <Brekkjern> Oh man, jq is a really annoying tool to deal with for what it does :S
[19:46:47] <bkhl> Well, how the streams coming in/out of processes are formatted is not so much a property of the shell as of the processes you choose to run with it.
[19:47:18] <vladimyr> Try gron/ungron with grep
[19:47:22] <bkhl> So either you'd need to have your shell have a lot of adapters for various programs, or you make a new set of program that's centred around JSON or something rather than primarly line based.
[19:47:59] <iDrougge> Like Powershell.
[19:48:06] <vladimyr> Middle ground is BSD's libxo
[19:48:06] <pe> Let's reinvent Self.
[19:48:23] <reneeontheweb> iDrougge: I guess it's hard to discuss because I'm probably misunderstanding your idea, but to me the whole concept of the shell is it sits right on top of the kernel as a text interface for its language. If there's suddenly some inter-process type system, then either I deal directly with it or I'm not on the bottom layer anymore and there's some
[19:48:24] <reneeontheweb> "raw-er" form of communication between processes where they exchange types and/or write/read actual binary data
[19:48:29] <iDrougge> The missing piece in the Unix philosophy is protocols, interfaces, formats.
[19:49:01] <iDrougge> Instead, you have glue, glue and glue.
[19:49:07] <reneeontheweb> yeah that's spot on though
[19:49:31] <reneeontheweb> i mean there are formats now too, it's just that they tend to be "look at the output and figure it out"
[19:49:59] <iDrougge> My understanding of a shell in the Unix sense is that it’s a command executor of sorts. Commands only output on your stdio by convention.

[19:54:24] <jkaye> I don't see why the text interface part is mandatory or even important. If the various commands/functions communicate using a "better" protocol, we could just enforce that these protocols are convertible to text where it's important

[19:55:41] <ngoldbaum> it is all bytes though

[20:29:53] <kline> trying to type the bit in the middle is difficult
[20:30:06] <ngoldbaum> i hate how powershell has unix aliases that work ok for like 75% of things but then you hit walls of incomptibility and eventually need to actually learn powershell with very little onramp
[20:30:29] <ngoldbaum> it would have been better to detect someone doing “ls” or whatever and point them to better docs

[20:31:21] <jkaye> kline, I do think it would be difficult. I don't think it would be impossible though. Or maybe it would be impossible in its current state.
