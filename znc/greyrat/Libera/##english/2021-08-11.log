[00:00:24] <ksft> yes, both of those are ungrammatical to me
[00:00:42] <StayHungry> ksft: here is a good explanation https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/124904/suggest-to-go-vs-suggest-going
[00:00:57] *** Quits: badbodh (~Thunderbi@user/badbodh) (Client Quit)
[00:01:05] <ksft> okay, it can also take a verb phrase as its single complement
[00:01:57] <StayHungry> in particular, there are examples such as 'someone suggested going for a walk' and 'someone suggested to meet Ms Rekha before leaving the Mumbai' with subtle differences in meaning.
[00:02:07] *** Joins: badbodh (~Thunderbi@user/badbodh)
[00:02:37] <ksft> but it can't take the recipient as one complement without a preposition and then the suggestion as a second complement
[00:02:57] <ksft> so "I suggest you doing that" is ungrammatical, although "I suggest doing that" is not

[00:09:58] <StayHungry> ksft: yeah, putting you in between was misleading
[00:18:26] * StayHungry is trying to figure out where he got 'suggest you to'
[00:20:01] <arash> Hello, what is the meaning of _ and __ people add before and after some words in irc ?
[00:21:13] <StayHungry> arash: example?
[00:21:21] <LuisP14> emphasis, ... i guess it's that use
[00:22:07] <ksft> arash: I think it comes from markdown, where that's used for italics
[00:22:16] <ksft> it indicates prosody
[00:23:12] <arash> for example : as long as you do _something_, it's going to be hard not to get _some kind_ of experience
[00:24:17] <arash> LuisP14, yes, i think its emphasis

[05:35:51] <r3> Do you know what I learned while attending (introductory/novice level) French language classes?  The reason I was having so much trouble learning French was that I didn't understand English well enough.
[05:35:53] <r3> By that I mean terms such as "subjunctive" and "catenative verb", even occasionally concepts like "clause" and "preposition", trip me up or give me pause even though I am a native speaker and can remember being educated about them - but that was decades ago...
[05:36:34] <LjL> you're by far not alone
[05:36:44] <LjL> and what "subjunctive" is used for widely varies by language
[05:37:03] <LjL> my ability to use subjunctive correctly in italian does not translate well to spanish at all (not really sure about french)
[05:37:09] <LjL> and english subjunctive is substantially different
[05:37:42] <LjL> i have no idea what a catenative verb is, and i consider myself moderately educated in this kind of thing
[05:38:20] <LjL> some would also argue that learning languages by such strict grammatical concepts is not conductive to fluency, although i'm agnostic on the issue
[05:38:31] <r3> heck, sometimes I have to double check (mentally) that a word is an adjective, for example, by thinking of the Mad Lib definitions for parts of speech... lol
[05:38:55] <LjL> English uses appositions (which are basically nouns "used as" adjectives) a lot
[05:39:08] <LjL> sometimes it's not trivial to tell the difference
[05:39:12] <r3> LjL: would you provice an example please?
[05:39:33] <LjL> i'm not good at example, but you said "clause"
[05:39:36] <LjL> let's talk about a "noun clause"
[05:39:40] <twb> "dog eater"?
[05:39:42] <LjL> that's a thing, it's a clause dominated by nouns
[05:39:51] <LjL> well, that too i guess
[05:40:14] <LjL> but "dog eater" tends to translate in romance language to something like "eater of dogs"
[05:40:28] <LjL> while for "noun clause", you'd simply use an adjective instead, so it'd be "nominal clause"
[05:41:17] <LjL> so is "noun"... an adjective?!
[05:41:29] <r3> what else could "dog eater" mean?  I'm short of imagination today, I can only think of "eater of dogs"
[05:41:30] <LjL> !w autological
[05:41:31] <tinsoldier> autological — Adjective: 1. (grammar, of a word, phrase, or especially an adjective) Possessing the property it describes. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/autological
[05:41:37] <r3> unless you mean a dog that is eating?
[05:41:59] <LjL> r3, yes, that's what it would mean; i'm saying that in french, you'd say something like "mangeur de chiens" (disclaimer: i don't know french)
[05:42:10] <LjL> in english, you use an apposition. just "dog" next to "eater"
[05:42:51] <LjL> in this case though it seems pretty obvious that "dog" is not an adjective, i'd say
[05:43:01] <r3> LjL: I see.  By the way, I Still don't know French lol - I mean I can pick apart phrases given access to enough (online) dictionaries
[05:43:18] <LjL> there are cases where i've felt unsure, and "noun clause" comes a tiny bit closer, though still not really. examples are best eaten fresh ;P
[05:43:36] * r3 reads up on the linked WP article
[05:43:42] <LjL> heh that's just a funny thing
[05:43:49] <LjL> "noun" is a noun, which makes it an autological word
[05:43:55] <r3> bbiab :)  cheers thanks

[19:29:48] <blkshp> I would consider this improper usage however it's specific to a field so makes it a technical term.

[20:08:07] <guideX> bullgard4, it makes total sense to me..
[20:08:31] <guideX> bullgard4, a developer makes a program to, let's say, have a bbs on a website.. however, it requires you to have a mail server
[20:08:46] <guideX> so the program checks that your mail server is working before it lets you install
[20:08:51] <guideX> this is the value
