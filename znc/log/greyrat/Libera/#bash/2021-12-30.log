[00:36:05] <Knix3> the input is line oriented. a new line is posted say every one second and I wan't to parse that line and output some text based on it
[00:36:53] <Knix3> okay I checked the link thank you very much
[00:37:24] <Knix3> can the file be /dev/stdin?
[00:37:38] <greycat> reading from stdin is the default; just don't do any redirection at all

[05:03:46] <jensen> are there any implications saving logging rsync output to a file in a directory that is synced in "reatime" (inotify) to a Raspberry Pi installed on a flash drive? In general, are many commands that write to a file e.g. "echo hi >> file" a concern in terms of disk performance or should one strive to write to a file less frequently by accumulating more data first?

[08:19:54] <Viking667> That's weird. Why would I have this line in my .bashrc?  export HISTCONTROL=$HISTCONTROL${HISTCONTROL+,}ignoredups
[08:20:20] <Blondie101010> that looks very normal
[08:20:35] <Blondie101010> that's the common way of setting config environment variables
[08:21:05] <Blondie101010> there ignoredups is specific to history, and a good idea most of the time
[08:21:06] <Viking667> erm, well.... the result is this:   echo ${HISTCONTROL};;; ignoredups,ignoredups,ignoredups
[08:21:21] <Blondie101010> why do you call it repeatedly?
[08:22:05] <Viking667> That's what the line appears to do, so I can only presume that ignoredups is already set by the time the user hits their ~/.bashrc
[08:22:35] <Blondie101010> just check the system config files
[08:23:08] <tirnanog> probably because an distro offered an opinionated .bashrc under /etc/skel which was originally used to populate your home directory.
[08:23:16] <tirnanog> a*
[08:23:21] <Blondie101010> but if your existing user .bashrc already include it, then you're repeating for nothing
[08:23:37] <Blondie101010> you can't control a user's history that way

[08:28:11] <tirnanog> it is a little stupid in so far as it will just keep appending ignoredups every time .bashrc is sourced.
[08:28:28] <tirnanog> shouldn't matter, but sloppy.
[08:28:36] <ormaaj> You could use an alias to disable logging for the current command, or to modify the history, or some other method.
[08:28:37] <tirnanog> also, there is absolutely no point in exporting HISTCONTROL.

[19:17:29] <earnestly> Careful use of 'subprocess', because you've decimated the definition of a shell, you now have the problem of defining what that even means in the context of a language.  Most languages, being universal, do in fact have the capacity for such sugar, by definition.

[20:16:16] <lopid> !set-e
[20:16:16] <greybot> "set -e" is an inheritance of the old bourne shell, and doesn't really work well with modern shell features. You'll really have less buggy scripts if you do the error handling manually instead of relying on the unreliable "set -e"; see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105
[20:17:46] <heiner_> Some people write scripts like ancient batch files: commands as they would be entered interactively, but combined in a text file. For these people "set -e" is appropriate.
[20:17:58] <ormaaj>  (not in a good way i mean)
[20:18:50] <NRK[m]> lopid: hmm, i c
[20:18:50] <phy1729> Not really since some commands return non-0 for non-errors
[20:18:53] <heiner_> Others write shell scripts using the shell programming language. These have no need for "set -e" because they check if their commands were successful themselves.
[20:20:29] <heiner_> phy1729: batch writers probably won't use "test", "if" etc. either...

[23:20:07] <sm> good day, Bash friends!
[23:20:12] <sm> I am cleaning up my old bash config for 2022. Despite docs like https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html I have always been confused about the many startup file possibilities. Have you seen any good writing on this ?
[23:20:12] <sm> How important is it these days to handle all of the bash vs other shells, login vs non-login, interactive vs non-interactive cases specially ?
[23:20:12] <sm> For someone who wants to simplify, would it be reasonably to have just: .bash_profile (shareable) and .bash_profile.local (for local config/secrets) ?
[23:20:36] <jensen> i understand, the caveat is to not use "--" as a string to print which I never do. I know this is not recommended, but it makes the msg function very useful as described, unless there's a simpler way to accomplish what i'm trying to do (i'm open to anything, this just seemed like a reasonable trade-off without a complicated msg function. The function is intended to be part of a util script to source,
[23:20:37] <jensen> so it should be flexible
[23:21:07] <tirnanog> !dotfiles > sm
[23:21:07] <greybot> sm: Set up your environment (PATH, LANG, EDITOR, ...) in ~/.bash_profile. Set up your bash shell (PS1, functions, shopts, ...) in ~/.bashrc. Then source .bashrc from .bash_profile. See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles>. For GUI logins, SEE YOUR DOCUMENTATION or ask your OS channel because they're all different and we don't know.
[23:21:36] <emanuele6> jensen: useful how?
[23:22:19] <emanuele6> msg 'my message' -- ls -l
[23:22:26] <tirnanog> sm: if you want to have one file source another on your own terms - such as in the way that you mentioned - that's fine, of course.
[23:22:40] <emanuele6> even without --
[23:24:57] <jensen> emanuele6: msg func passes arguments to  uses printf, so printf "%s\n" "arg1" "arg2". I might even add a conditional and use notify-send instead of printf, whose 1st argument is the title of notification and 2nd is the body of the notification. So the entire string in one argument would not work
[23:25:27] <emanuele6> you example was:   msg "this" "is" "usage"
[23:26:10] <emanuele6> that should run `printf '%s\n' this is usage'  ?

[23:28:17] <sm> when I launch a shell in emacs, I think it's a non-login shell
[23:28:35] <jensen> emanuele6: yes, and `--` in `msg "this" "is" -- "usage"` would print "this" "is" and run the usage function. This was in reply to the purpose of `--`, which I understand is ill-advised
[23:28:40] * sm considers ln -s .bashrc .bash_profile is the way 
[23:28:51] <tirnanog> I wouldn't recommend it.
[23:28:54] <sm> s/is the way//
[23:29:11] <emanuele6> sm: you can check with `echo "$0"', if it says `-bash' (or `-shellname' in general) it is a login shell
[23:29:32] <emanuele6> jensen: it is still pointless
[23:29:38] <tirnanog> sm: there's more to it, such as not running code that has absolutely not utility for a non-interactive shell.
[23:29:48] <sm> emanuele6: nice tip
[23:29:51] <tirnanog> sm: in particular, commands that might produce output can break other programs that expect for quiet.
[23:30:06] <emanuele6> you can just run cmd $'this\nusage'
[23:30:15] <jensen> i don't understand how it's pointless, [cmd] is optional for the msg function
[23:30:19] <sm> tirnanog: indeed, but if I want simplicity, and I make sure it's quiet, and nothing is too slow..
[23:30:21] <emanuele6> i mean $'this\nis'
[23:30:45] <tirnanog> sm: well, if you can guarantee that, and also guarantee that running the same code twice will have no side effects, yes. it's still weird, though.

[23:32:51] <emanuele6> having a command that takes two lists of words is terrible
[23:33:03] <sm> tirnanog: things are just too complex to maintain, it will be worth some special casing if I can reduce moving parts and cognitive load. What's the *i* about there ?
[23:33:28] <tirnanog> sm: where the shell is interactive, the value of $- will contain 'i'.

[23:36:45] <emanuele6> ...
[23:37:01] <rendar> emanuele6, fd number 3 is neither stdin, nor stdout, nor stderr

[23:39:19] <emanuele6> ah

[23:41:28] <earendel> reading it into a variable would require the stream to end. and then you could just echo the variable.
[23:41:32] * sm thinks symlinking .bashrc to .bash_profile is safe, because nothing executes both of them
[23:41:47] <tirnanog> sm: a common approach is for .bash_profile to source .bashrc if it exists, and for .bashrc to immediately return if non-interactive. but I can't think of any obvious drawback for what you have in mind, as long as you use $- in a logical fashion.
