[02:09:01] <notzmv> what up
[02:09:57] <hayley> I'm making man made horrors beyond my comprehension while trying to make the SBCL GC parallel.
[02:10:12] <selwyn> will you get $
[02:11:05] <hayley> Probably not.
[02:11:12] <pl> selwyn: combination of shitty coding and "code is law" on top of system designed to act similarly to fictional "sound money"
[02:11:31] <pl> (re: blockchain and why defi stuff gets hacked all the time)
[02:11:34] <selwyn> right
[02:11:53] <hayley> Well, stylewarning will probably continue his sponsorship subscription, but that was there before.
[02:12:31] <hayley> The GC only seems to go wrong if I make the one worker thread allocate in its own regions. But it's supposed to behave. Hm.
[02:12:33] <pl> selwyn: so, banks can use tools to reverse transaction, make it invalid, etc.
[02:13:32] <pl> selwyn: blockchain can't, because the notion was created by specific confluence of goldbugs with cypherpunks, who wanted money that would act like gold coins in fantasy books
[02:13:35] * hayley is also planning to have to comment on exactly why allowing people to delete replies to their posts would be terrible for misinformation.
[02:15:25] <selwyn> cypherpunk sounds cooler than it probably is
[02:16:17] <pl> it could be cool
[02:16:27] <pl> but it also gave us bitcoin
[02:21:18] <selwyn> whats a goldbug
[02:22:00] <pl> a person obsessed with gold standard, also related to "sound money"
[02:22:22] <selwyn> i know someone who wants europe to fragment into national currencies again
[02:22:24] <selwyn> the more the better
[02:23:38] <pl> ah, yes, fuckup trade and exchange to make it easier pickings for USA/Russia
[02:24:26] <selwyn> as i understand it withdrawing from the eurozone is impossible without collapsing the whole thing
[02:25:01] <pl> not necessarily
[02:25:05] <pl> just hard and painful
[02:25:18] <pl> currency changes are that in general
[02:26:21] <pl> it took several years (more than a decade?) to make transition to Euro seem simple
[02:28:25] <selwyn> the argument is that in order to change over, there has to be a changeover period of several years, in part to change all of the bank code, to be denominated in a national currency
[02:28:36] <pl> BS
[02:28:42] <selwyn> in the end, everyone takes their money out of euros which causes a run on the banks
[02:29:07] <pl> selwyn: pretty much any bigger bank has its internal coding capable of handling multiple currencies
[02:29:16] <selwyn> well
[02:29:17] <pl> at least in Europe
[02:29:19] <selwyn> things like atms
[02:29:28] <selwyn> not necessarily the internal bank structure
[02:30:02] <pl> selwyn: well, ATMs are somewhat easier to handle in that regard
[02:30:15] <pl> anyway, coding issues are... not much of a problem
[02:30:17] <pl> it's all the rest
[02:30:17] <selwyn> complexity that didn't exist in 1993 when the czechoslovak currency splintered
[02:30:32] <selwyn> ok
[02:30:37] <pl> and the rampant stupidity of breaking into many currencies again
[02:31:33] <selwyn> i wonder what britain would have looked like if it joined
[02:32:53] <pl> well, it would be probably harder to drive Brexit
[02:33:43] <selwyn> the weaker currency would have helped industry and tilt the balance away from the city of london
[02:37:29] <selwyn> is the euro a success?

[02:41:41] <pl> selwyn: I'd say yes. It's not without faults, ofc, but it definitely makes trade easier
[02:47:24] <selwyn> it seems ominous that everyones destiny is bound up with each other
[02:47:31] <selwyn> though i suppose that was the point
[02:58:46] * hayley tries to run SBCL under rr and rr crashes.
[03:01:37] <moon-child> lol
[03:02:03] <hayley> Well, I have no idea why making one GC thread allocate into its own regions, instead of the regions in global variables, makes shit break.
[03:03:48] <hayley> So I have no tools, and an unhandled memory fault at #x5.

[03:32:06] <gilberth> selwyn: On that note, the EUR being weaker than the D-Mark was very helpful for Germany's economy.
[03:32:21] <selwyn> well yeah
[03:32:31] <selwyn> well
[03:32:37] <selwyn> helpful for exports
[03:33:17] <selwyn> i don't know if germany likes being the lynchpin of an entire continent
[03:34:00] <gilberth> lynchpin?
[03:34:20] <selwyn> um
[03:34:33] <selwyn> the critical point, sth like that
[03:34:48] <gilberth> Are we?
[03:35:21] <moon-child> that was my impression
[03:35:24] <selwyn> i would say so
[03:35:55] <selwyn> every eurozone country's economic fortunes depend on the nature of their relationship with germany
[03:37:28] <gilberth> Hmm, does it? We are the largest economy in the EU-zone, granted. But I never perceived it as if everyone else would somehow depend on us. Hmm.
[03:38:00] <moon-child> didn't germany bail out greece a couple of years ago?
[03:38:13] <gilberth> It did.
[03:39:23] <hayley> gilberth: I just don't see why using different regions, when I presumably am handling them correctly, should be a problem.
[03:40:03] <gilberth> moon-child: It's rather the reverse: A failing EUR would imply severe problems to our industry.
[03:40:46] <moon-child> reverse of what?
[03:41:44] <gilberth> moon-child: Reverse off that Germany would have any disadvantage by bailing out Greece.
[03:41:54] <selwyn> it was not altruism
[03:41:57] <moon-child> oh, sure
[03:42:09] <moon-child> I don't think anyone said that :P
[03:42:11] <gilberth> selwyn: Of course not.
[03:42:29] <moon-child> only that other eu countries _do_ rely on de, whatever their motivations
[03:42:49] <gilberth> moon-child: Sorry then, a few local groups complained loudly then.
[03:43:02] <selwyn> southern european exports are hurt by having a strong currency
[03:43:23] <selwyn> while the netherlands benefits from being able to export german goods through their ports
[03:43:43] <gilberth> Yes, they are. But it is not like they had exactly healthy economies before the EUR.
[03:43:48] <selwyn> countries which could prosper via their relationship to germany did the best
[03:43:53] <selwyn> gilberth: italy?
[03:44:05] <gilberth> yep.
[03:44:11] <selwyn> they used to export a lot
[03:44:51] <gilberth> Maybe my memories are biased. idk
[03:47:07] <gilberth> Anyhow, we managed to maintain an industry, although current climate politics does everything to harm it. You can't do well, when everybody is just selling services and financial products. The flip-side is that wages are relatively low.
[03:47:32] <selwyn> cost of living seems low as well
[03:48:19] <gilberth> Depends on where you are. Munich could be pretty expensive. But compared to London every place has low living costs. :-)
[03:48:24] * hayley seems to be using REGRIND as the "throw lots of shit at GC" stress test.
[03:48:26] <hayley> I guess it does run the SBCL compiler, which is a pretty hairy thing.
[03:48:45] <moon-child> sf?
[03:49:07] <moon-child> and singapore, I think?
[03:49:12] <gilberth> selwyn: But Berlin in comparison is still cheap.
[03:49:21] <hayley> But I still don't get it. I handle per-GC-thread regions just like the serial GC handles global regions. sigh
[03:49:24] <gilberth> moon-child: New York perhaps. And Paris.
[03:50:09] <moon-child> i think vancouver takes the crown for real estate prices.  Stupid.
[03:50:21] <selwyn> but why
[03:50:44] <selwyn> canada is so big
[03:51:16] <moon-child> yeah, but population is highly concentrated
[03:51:35] <moon-child> go out into the middle of saskatchewan or sth, sure, pretty cheap probably
[03:51:48] <gilberth> Well, real estate prices are inflated by a huge margin.
[03:51:54] <selwyn> i mean, why don't they just expand the cities, or build new ones

[03:53:00] <gilberth> selwyn: Funny. Why doesn't Berlin just expand? Nobody lives around that city.
[03:53:57] <moon-child> 'it was felt that--just as cancer-fighting chemotherapy nearly kills healthy tissue while it kills tumors--the healthier US economy would be better able to bear the severe burden of an unproductive software industry than the Soviet economy could'  lmao
[03:54:07] <gilberth> And besides, why do I want to move right into a city towards the center? Even if that means I could afford only a small flat?
[03:55:00] <selwyn> i would if i could afford it
[03:56:12] <selwyn> social life, reduced travel times to other places in the city, nice to live in a historical area
[03:57:00] * gilberth nods
[03:57:22] <gilberth> Though scratch "historical area" ;)
[03:57:52] <moon-child> didn't you specifically move away from a house in the middle of the country, fo rthe same reason? :P
[03:59:29] <gilberth> moon-child: We have pandemic and I am not healthy. It's more like I moved to my cousin's place because solitude would kill me otherwise. But my plan still is to move to Berlin.
[04:00:16] <gilberth> moon-child: And it's the very north of the country, not the middle. Still people there are a bit strange, if you don't fit into a group.
[04:02:03] <moon-child> iiiiinteresting.  Never thought of this
[04:02:25] <gilberth> Of what? The group thing?
[04:02:26] <moon-child> one advantage of cisc, apparently, is less pressure on the register renamer/file
[04:02:34] <moon-child> gilberth: no, completely unrelated thing ^
[04:02:50] <gilberth> ok
[04:05:08] <gilberth> Anyhow, if you aren't a normie in your life-style and planning, you have no chance to get to know people in that rural area. Though it isn't that rural, the nearest city has ~200k citizens. Doesn't change much. In the large cities like Hamburg or Berlin, nobody cares that you don't fit into one of their mental bins they have for classifying people. Poor.
[04:06:18] <moon-child> I lived in a city of 25k, I think, and got along fine.  Though, pacific northwesterners are always a bit odd...

[04:08:01] <selwyn> too small
[04:08:48] <gilberth> moon-child: Well, I don't know. I had problems in that region in very North Germany. But I am not the only one having trouble to get to know people there. And the conclusion is not mine, but one that I heard from a dozen others who moved there. It's perhaps a very different story, if you were raised there and never left the region.
[04:10:50] <gilberth> And I never expected it would be that hard. I mean, a city (the nearby at ~30km distance) of 200k isn't exactly small either.
[04:13:18] <gilberth> I was not expecting to get to know anybody in the smallish (2,000 people IIRC) town my house is in. But if people don't talk to you, how do get to know them?
[04:13:36] <gilberth> And the problem is not me, the problem is them.
[04:14:45] <gilberth> selwyn: Indeed. I need a large city just because it offers more things you could do. Especially a tad bit off the mainstream.
[04:22:15] <selwyn> what would you want that you cant get in a city of 25k
[04:23:48] <moon-child> well, I could not take dance lessons in my city of 25k; I had to go to the neighbouring city of 10k
[04:23:58] <moon-child> but
[04:24:39] <epony> GPON

[04:25:46] <epony> the list is very tall
[04:26:28] <gilberth> moon-child: Talk to people? Get a social life? And yes, dancing lessons. As I still was healthy I wanted to take swing dancing lessons -- none offered there.
[04:38:36] <gilberth> Hmm, CLIM2 eats like 16% CPU when idle. Why do I try to avoid polling like the plague again?
[04:39:40] <moon-child> iirc sdl took something like 5-6%
[04:40:18] <moon-child> though, that is meant for games, so refreshing every frame is not bad
[04:41:28] <gilberth> Sure. Though I do that too in principle.
[04:43:10] <gilberth> Anyhow, the real trouble is that there is PROCESS-WAIT, which waits for a predicate becoming true. The only way with native threads to implement that is polling.
[04:43:46] <gilberth> Didn't matter for the Lisp machine.
[04:44:51] <gilberth> Though that's bad for the climate. But then even the Lisp machine could have been clever there and just halt the CPU waiting for an interrupt, if nothing else happens.
[04:45:31] <moon-child> well, you still need a little effort
[04:45:35] <moon-child> what if you want to play an animation?
[04:46:28] <gilberth> For my embedded stuff I also used the equivalent of PROCESS-WAIT, but shut off the CPU, if I made one round through all threads with none doing anything. And we needed a very long battery life, so power consumption was a concern.
[04:47:24] <gilberth> moon-child: Play an animation? Just wait for the next vsync if you can or 16ms when in doubt.
[04:48:54] <gilberth> I can't wait on vsync with X11, which is a pity. But Cocoa implicitly gives you that. You could queue dirty regions of your panes and the main event loop will call your repaint handler once a frame, not more often.
[04:48:59] <moon-child> sure.  Doing something every vsync is how sdl gets to 5% cpu usage
[04:49:33] <gilberth> Though I wonder how SDL gets to 5% CPU usage there. Seems a little high.
[04:50:45] <moon-child> hmm, I get 1-2% on the nice desktop.  5% was on the craptop
[04:52:15] <gilberth> To be fair, these numbers are inflated these days as the CPU gets clocked down when it hasn't to do much.
[04:53:17] <moon-child> true
[04:57:57] <gilberth> I just tested by GLX CADR console. All it does is mindlessly blittering from shared memory once a frame with some after-glow effect I considered fancy, and it already is at ~8% CPU.
[05:00:05] <gilberth> I wonder, if I could find the specifics of the phosphor used with the real CADR screen. ;)
[05:00:49] * hayley continues printf debugging.
[05:01:14] <hayley> When I use thread-local allocation buffers, apparently we find 0 areas instead of 1 on one collection. That could help.

[05:16:32] <hayley> Hm, if I disable one optimisation, then it works, but SBCL claims it found a hellalot more areas than 1.
[05:17:50] <gilberth> moon-child: What kind of rendering?

[05:21:22] <gilberth> Including all the things like cap-shape, joint-shape and dashes.
[05:22:10] <moon-child> lines->rectangles->triangles?  Or do you want like a fill predicate so you can cover the whole thing with 1 triangle?
[05:23:03] <gilberth> No, I need a list of triangles I could pass to the RENDER extension, so that I could draw an anti-aliased line.
[05:23:36] <moon-child> oh x stuff
[05:23:41] <gilberth> That is: Do what Cairo does.

[05:24:15] <hayley> (gc :full t) ⇒ GC invariant lost, file "immobile-space.c", line 386 ; Damn, I forgot all about immobile space.
[05:24:15] <gilberth> Yeah, it would be nice, if I could draw a line with the RENDER extension without depending on a C library.
[05:25:50] <gilberth> But it's not important. I intend to punt and just use libX11 and Cairo.
[05:31:05] * hayley reads immobile-space.c and spots that there is a pretty likely race.
[05:32:09] <hayley> One thread calls scav1, which checks if an immobile is in the right generation. It is, so it calls enliven_immobile_obj. Meanwhile, another thread goes by, and finds the object, promoting it to a new generation. Then the first thread goes to do magic on that object, and finds the generation was changed on it.
[05:32:12] * hayley sighs
[05:34:24] <hayley> It then goes to enqueue the object, so I need a global lock. double sigh

[13:18:08] <hayley> Merriam-Webster gives the time definition first, and then the "temples of skull" one after. e.g. "temporal locality", "temporal logic of actions"

[15:47:03] <epony> In Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (1917), Lenin outlined the five features of capitalist development that lead to imperialism: 
[15:47:03] <epony> 1. Concentration of production and capital leading to the dominance of national and multinational monopolies and cartels.
[15:47:03] <epony> 2. Industrial capital as the dominant form of capital has been replaced by finance capital, with the industrial capitalists increasingly reliant on capital provided by monopolistic financial institutions. "Again and again, the final word in the development of banking is monopoly".
[15:47:04] <epony> 3. The export of the aforementioned finance capital is emphasized over the export of goods.
[15:47:06] <epony> 4. The economic division of the world by multinational cartels.
[15:47:08] <epony> 5. The political division of the world into colonies by the great powers, in which the great powers monopolise investment.[31]
[15:47:11] <epony> Generally, the relationship among Marxists and radical, left-wing organisations who are anti-war, often involves persuading such political activists to progress from pacifism to anti-imperialism—that is, to progress from the opposition of war, in general, to the condemnation of the capitalist economic system, in particular.[32]
[15:47:43] <epony> the outline of Chomsky is confined to US late financialised and corrupt capitalism
[15:48:50] <epony> Chomsky is wrong on a number of occasions that "it can be fixed", is seen as naivist view of the last stage of "dismantling" opposition, false beliefs and unionisation of protests.

[19:20:02] <shka> funny, because snes was technically superior
[19:26:55] <White_Flame> snes = better palette, better sound, mode7, more sprites
[19:27:33] <White_Flame> genesis = better CPU, wider data bus, some more minor tile effects
[19:27:50] <White_Flame> oh, snes = better transparency, too
[19:28:19] <shka> White_Flame: that's why i think that snes is technologically superior
[19:28:30] <White_Flame> so genesis could do more with software-rendered things
[19:28:43] <White_Flame> while snes always relied on the hardware features
[19:29:02] <White_Flame> and yeah, I agree that overall the snes was better, but the underclocked cpu on an 8-bit bus was a real bottleneck, too
[19:29:16] <White_Flame> oh also, SNES = waaaaay better controller :)
[19:29:38] <shka> the funniest thing is that konami was releasing games for both consoles

[19:36:02] <White_Flame> a system would need something like 290 pixels across to have square pixels on a NTSC signal

[21:03:20] <gilberth> ck_: Indeed, as RENDER can only render triangles only. So that's the missing link. I need however see what happens to self-intersecting resulting polygons.

[21:07:41] <ck_> in other words there are no compound polygons in the output, it's all triangle soup
[21:07:51] <ck_> so they may overlap, but there's no "self-intersection"
[21:08:57] <gilberth> Yes, and that is what RENDER wants. It gets triangle strips or sth like that. It's been a while.
[21:09:59] <gilberth> ck_: I assume there is self-overlapping, if the input polyline self-overlaps.
[21:11:06] <ck_> also if it does not
[21:11:21] <ck_> the second screenshot shows all the cases I think
[21:11:46] <gilberth> Like in the lower-left of your demo Z?
[21:13:24] <ck_> or the upper right -- any polyline that has different slopes will have some overlap at the inner points
[21:13:30] <ck_> if it has any width to it at all
[21:14:08] <gilberth> ck_: I have to see what RENDER does here. As I said: It's been a while and the RENDER extension spec is a bit brief and does not always agree 100% with the implementation. For self-intersecting input polylines it depends on how you define your API. A detail that often also isn't specified very well.
[21:14:15] <ck_> well, "any triangulation output of that code that has as an input a polyline will".. I should have said to be exact

[22:25:07] <selwyn> you are better at that than britain
[22:25:53] <selwyn> jet engine, advanced passenger train, silicon photonic quantum computer (perhaps)
[22:25:55] <gilberth> I mean, Zuse came up with the computer. Telefunken invented the mouse. MP3 is a German invention, etc.
[22:26:11] <ck_> mp3 was a great business for fhg

[22:26:48] <ck_> look at the org chart of the institute that came up with it -- they still have an entire department for patents! that should tell you something
[22:27:01] <selwyn> the advanced passenger train was a concept to make high speed rail work on old victorian rails (important for britain)
[22:27:02] <gilberth> ck_: Still, isn't it Apple who made billions of that in the long run?
[22:27:34] <selwyn> british rail eventually succeeded in building such a thing, but it was too noisy, and got scrapped for ideological reasons iirc
[22:27:36] <ck_> and a percentage of that flowed back to here
[22:27:53] <ck_> wouldn't call it a failure, that's what the Fraunhofer groups is for actually

[22:28:09] <gilberth> ck_: Really? I wasn't aware.

[22:29:05] <shka> Italians are surprisingly innovative

[22:32:11] <shka> selwyn: managing to actually produce stuff at scale is non-trivial
[22:32:38] <shka> for instance, it was Germans who came up with elliptic wing found in the spitfire
[22:33:10] <gilberth> Zuse was a strange figure. In the 40's he already pondered what we call von-Neumann probes and also reasoned that the universe might be a cellular automata. And he came up with Plankakül. But for some reason, he never published.

[22:34:14] <gilberth> selwyn: Well, I only have to point to myself. But I suffer from depression, which might be an excuse.
[22:34:38] <shka> and time consuming
[22:36:06] <selwyn> anyway, one of the main reasons for ducati's success seemed to be clever use of the internal market after the war
[22:36:14] <gilberth> selwyn: Anyhow, with time more and more notes are found in Zuse's unpublished notes and work.
[22:37:07] <gilberth> But he was an engineer and no scientist.
[22:37:23] <ck_> Gauss also had a lot of unpublished stuff in his estate, right? for one example

[22:58:18] <shka> rotateq: WW2 was a crazy time :P
[22:58:27] <selwyn> babbage spent lots of time investigating why windows broke, trying to ban children rolling hoops and street musicians
[22:58:33] <selwyn> a committed small time bastard
[22:58:54] <gilberth> Anyhow, the original Z3 was a real machine which existed and worked. And prior to that was the mechanical Z1.
[22:59:27] <White_Flame> are the actual workings fo the z1 documented anywhere?  I know a replica was built, but the workings weren't explained last time I looked some decade+ ago
[22:59:52] <White_Flame> I built clocked mechanical computation gates in Lego, and then found the Z1
[23:00:01] <gilberth> White_Flame: I have no idea.
[23:00:33] <White_Flame> I got up to a 1-bit full adder.  making an actual CPU would be on the order of some square meters
[23:00:44] <gilberth> In general it's depressing how little you find about actual data/schematics/working about early computers.
[23:00:48] <White_Flame> but it seemed like it would scale
[23:00:51] <White_Flame> yeah
[23:01:24] <ck_> they have a little bit of information at the HNF I believe, but I don't know how complete
[23:01:29] <gilberth> What I got is, that early computers were serial, so your 1-bit adder should do.
[23:01:40] <White_Flame> nah, the z1 had wide ALU gates
[23:02:03] <White_Flame> something like 30+ bit floating point values
[23:02:22] <gilberth> I find drum machines particular interesting. With just a few hundred valves and running synchronous to the drum rotating in serial fashion.
[23:02:37] <selwyn> what's the appeal of early computers for you?
[23:02:48] <White_Flame> me?  just the interesting challenge of it
[23:03:07] <gilberth> White_Flame: Yes, I was referring to valve machines with delay lines for registers.
[23:03:12] <White_Flame> for me and the lego mechanical computing, it was just the notion that if somebody had nothing but today's knowledge and nature, could they build a working "caveman computer"?
[23:04:11] <White_Flame> and I wanted to do it with just linear slidey bits, no rotation

[23:05:48] <gilberth> White_Flame: How would your memory look like? When I ponder "build a machine as low-tech as you can get" it always boils down to the question how to have memory.
[23:06:30] <White_Flame> the bus interface would be pretty slow
[23:07:11] <White_Flame> as multiplexers are kinda required and my architecture basically used 1 cycle per gate propagation
[23:07:49] <White_Flame> but a grid of bits, layered in 8 to make a byte, would be feasible

[23:08:11] <White_Flame> the biggest ponderous question I had would be if it was worth it to make a single-instruction computer, or actually give it a "real" but simple ISA
[23:09:25] <gilberth> Isn't that a speed, space and machine complexity trade-off?
[23:09:30] <White_Flame> yep
[23:09:46] <ck_> nop nop nop nop nop
[23:09:57] <White_Flame> also I didn't quite think about it, but a turing-style read/write head would probably make a lot of sense for a mechanical computer
[23:09:58] <ck_> I'll go execute that program now and go to bed, have a nice one
[23:10:40] <White_Flame> anyway, I'm AFK as well
[23:11:03] <gilberth> I find it interesting that this O calculus applies to HW too. E.g. a carry-lookahead or carry-select adder needs more gates than a ripple-carry adder, which needs more than a serial adder.
[23:11:36] <gilberth> Same applies to ISAs.
