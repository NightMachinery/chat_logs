[00:20:15] <Alagolafre> I would use the former. Even if it is a plurality of meetings per record, it just sounds a little odd with a plural 'meeting' there.
[00:21:05] <LuisR14> of course, a short description was what i was seeing in it

[06:10:35] <Alagolafre> Oh yeah, sorry Becci, I am definitely not qualified to do legal wording. (Here is a cute illustration of Alagolafre, btw https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/ILLUMIN.ASP?Size=mid&IllID=11802 .)
[06:10:42] <twb> Becci: I would write something like "NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.  MAY CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH"
[06:11:04] <Becci> something along the lines of:  "Don't eat this food any more as germs will form and eating this could lead to severe sickness or mortal illness"
[06:11:10] <twb> Becci: for a comparison you might look at so-called "bath milk"

[06:12:16] <Becci> it's a wild world that we have to warn people.
[06:13:09] <Maxdamantus> Presumably "bath milk" would just be unpasteurised milk being sold in such a way to avoid regulations about milk that is considered safe to drink.

[06:13:32] <twb> Right.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk#Australia

[06:15:18] <Becci> And you suggest I change this to "injury or death", right?
[06:15:25] <twb> Becci: that's far too long
[06:15:37] <twb> It's a warning label, it needs to be very concise
[06:15:44] <twb> e.g. "THIS MAY KILL YOU"
[06:16:04] <twb> Becci: I would also use standard labelling unless you have a good reason not to
[06:16:29] <Becci> I am afraid that the people who produce the food sue us for saying their food could kill.
[06:16:52] <Becci> It's an experiment with freezing / unfreezing stuff several times (microscopic stuff)
[06:17:06] <Becci> now imagine you do that to a microwave product of a big company
[06:17:12] <Becci> and then you say "may kill you"
[06:18:19] <twb> Are you more worried about being sued, or killing people?
[06:18:42] <Becci> both.
[06:18:49] <twb> Students are not even going to read to the end of https://dpaste.org/WMeB/raw
[06:19:38] <Becci> OK - injury or death it is.
[06:20:16] <Becci> https://dpaste.org/uTfG
[06:20:29] <Becci> use the "raw" version:    https://dpaste.org/uTfG/raw
[06:21:23] <Becci> is that acceptable?  it's still long, but I clearly state injury or death
[06:21:45] <Becci> as English is not my first language, I would appreciate a correction
[06:23:44] <Becci> Alagolafre, Thank you for the URL to the picture of Agolafre
[06:24:44] <twb> Becci: why do you want it to be long?
[06:24:53] <Becci> somehowish
[06:25:05] <Becci> twb, I cannot just say "this food can kill you"
[06:25:19] <twb> What's wrong with: 13:40 <twb> Becci: I would write something like "NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.  MAY CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH"
[06:25:26] <Becci> it should explain why, so that it's clear, that the food itself is not bad, but the bacteria is
[06:25:27] <twb> Or even "DO NOT EAT"
[06:25:35] <twb> Becci: OK do that *after* the warning
[06:25:56] <Becci> ok. Thank you!

[08:59:48] <bob_x1> twb and why rfc2229 dicts are aweful ?
[09:00:24] <twb> Because Walt Disney ruined copyright so all actively-maintained dictionaries are not available for conversion to dictd format
[09:01:25] <bob_x1> oh... and here copyright problems
[09:01:28] <twb> Even Fowler's Modern Dictionary, from before the first world war, is not available due to Mickey Mouse

[09:01:48] <bob_x1> did not even heard about disneys problems

[22:57:10] <GuiToris> in math class we wrote numbers under Γ   Could someone tell me what the subject could have been?
[22:57:54] <huf> long division maybe?
[22:58:30] <GuiToris> I'm looking it up
[23:00:10] <GuiToris> no, as far as I remember we don't do much with numbers, we didn't divide or multiply them
[23:00:15] <qur> Yeah; if it was being used as a symbol, (rather than "layout" lines to organize e.g. long division), the Greek letter gamma has dozens of uses in math :/
[23:00:42] <huf> yeah but for math class it's gonna be small gamma
[23:00:57] <GuiToris> it might have been some sort of logical thinking
[23:01:27] <GuiToris> we didn't study this in elementary or high school
[23:01:33] <GuiToris> I wish I had notes
[23:01:39] <darsie> ##math
[23:01:53] <GuiToris> they can't read minds either
[23:01:57] <huf> ¬
[23:02:04] <huf> and it means "not"
[23:02:20] <darsie> Γ Г
