[21:28:18] <Activ8> I'll give that a check out, will change the installer at some point just needed a working concept
[21:28:28] <Activ8> anyone can install a working version now
[21:28:36] <Activ8> they don't need to be savi
[21:28:41] <Activ8> savi-ish
[21:28:47] <mooff> if they trust you not to pwn them, without looking :)
[21:29:00] <mooff> it's hard to inspect a binary
[21:29:23] <Activ8> it is - if I could get 1 batch file working I would have just released a single batch file
[21:29:27] <Activ8> it's 5 batch files atm
[21:29:42] <mooff> GitHub Actions would basically let you run a batch file on GitHub's cloud
[21:29:53] <mooff> to make the final installer
[21:30:03] <Activ8> oh nice I didn't know that
[21:30:14] <mooff> and then upload it with a link to the build job output to Releases
[21:30:38] <Activ8> I'll check out some guides for windows binaries on gith
[21:30:59] <mooff> it means people can trust that you probably haven't included nefarious code somehow :)
[21:31:07] <Activ8> ofc I understand that
[21:31:43] <Activ8> I'm sticking a bit on the windows NODE_ENV=production part really, this is the bit it sticks at when it does the yarn build.
[21:31:49] <Activ8> When I run it in CMD manually it works
[21:31:58] <Activ8> as soon as I stick it in the batch script, it fails and exits out
[21:32:06] <Activ8> nothing has changed in that time
[21:33:31] <mooff> share the .bat line that tries to set NODE_ENV=production
[21:34:20] <Activ8> https://bpa.st/3T2Q
[21:34:39] <Activ8> the line where it says ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Yarn\bin\yarn.cmd" yarn build" I tried just "yarn build" 
[21:34:43] <Activ8> it still exits
[21:35:31] <Activ8> and when it did do a yarn build it complained about "npx browserslist@latest --update-db" can be seen in the video
[21:36:55] <Activ8> I'll get the source up shortly, that's not a problem releasing it.  Fine with that.  It probably can be done MUCH better but was aiming for concept
[21:38:41] <Activ8> uploading code now
[21:42:48] <Activ8> done, it's up there
[21:53:49] <Activ8> I wonder if I can call it via START /WAIT yarn build
[21:53:55] <Activ8> might be exiting early
[21:54:22] <Activ8> or CALL yarn build might be the trick
[21:56:11] <Activ8> that's it, the dirty little bugga! I think I solved it.  It's calling another file and that's why the current one is exiting I think
[21:59:01] <Activ8> aw no it's not, combined the files and still exits
[21:59:03] <Activ8> :(

[22:18:15] <Activ8> I got it! fixed
[22:18:33] <Activ8> runs from 1 batch file now it was the npx browserslist@latest --update-db line needed a call in front of it
