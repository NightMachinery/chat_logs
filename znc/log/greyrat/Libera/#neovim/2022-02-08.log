[11:51:53] <jaawerth[m]> well I'd look at that catpuccin readme/doc to see if they mention where you can see its configured highlight groups. granted that help doc sectin is a bit sparse and generic-looking but there seem to be sample configs in the same file, with "hl_group" presumambly being replaced by the the name of the group
[11:52:25] <jaawerth[m]> the simplest seems tobe hl_shortcut = groupname in the options but that presumably only highlights the shortcut
[11:57:16] <jaawerth[m]> gilganix: also, it looks like that theme has builtin support for https://github.com/glepnir/dashboard-nvim if you don't want to do it by hand and aren't married to that plugin. No idea if one is actually better than the other though; while both are on my to-explore list, I'm not used to using a startup dashboard so it hasn't been a priority for me
[11:57:58] <M-elo-[m]> Appreciate the info mate! 
[11:57:59] <M-elo-[m]> Will tweak around with catppuccin's dashboard-nvim implementation and check if it works
[11:58:04] <M-elo-[m]> Because they do indeed have a module for dashboard but not for alpha
[11:58:36] <M-elo-[m]> I used to be a startify user in the past, that's why I want to remain a user of alpha-nvim, if I fail to figure it out then I'll revert to dashboard-nvim

[12:04:17] <jaawerth[m]> itl ooks like you could adapt that dashboard setup. going from the alpha doc line here https://github.com/goolord/alpha-nvim/blob/main/doc/alpha.txt#L78 - I'd probably try setting .hl like that with start/end cols for the header and such
[12:05:25] <jaawerth[m]> oh though it looks like it's doing colors instead of groups so it might take a little more digging

[16:50:37] <clason[m]> you need to escape Lua strings

[16:53:41] <SeanDewar[m]> do note that in vimscript those things are escaped as octals
[16:54:11] <SeanDewar[m]> in lua they're escaped as denary
[16:54:35] <bitblt[m]> ahhh
[16:54:38] <bitblt[m]> that must be it
[16:57:16] <sunjonSenghanBri> ah, that's how ii14 had mentioned interacting via stderr
[16:57:57] <sunjonSenghanBri> that was the missing puzzle piece for something similar (term colors > vim) that I'd had sitting around for a while
[16:58:15] <ii14[m]> yes, in context of changing cursor position
[16:58:25] <sunjonSenghanBri> and my speculative attempts on how to achieve it because a bit convoluted
[16:58:54] <sunjonSenghanBri> but kinda of related; and an observation on the aforementioned autocmds PR..
[17:00:05] <sunjonSenghanBri> reading the code for that PR (and the winbar one also), made much more sense to the uninitiated(myself), than an attempt to do it blind, or the straight question: "How do _you_ think it would be done?"
[17:00:40] <sunjonSenghanBri> it struck me that familiarity with the project is (obviously) quite a big deal.
[17:01:11] <sunjonSenghanBri> so my loosely defined thought was: "a PR deconstructed". 
[17:01:50] <sunjonSenghanBri> it might be that you get just as much if you happen to watch someone like TJ and they happen to be implementing something like this on stream
[17:01:55] <clason[m]> well, you can watch TJ smack his forehead against tests and tooling until he got it right, if you are really interested :)
[17:02:17] <sunjonSenghanBri> but a "final product" deconstructed was more what I had in mind
[17:02:23] <clason[m]> which is pretty much how everybody seems to gain familiarity with the project ;)
[17:02:33] <sunjonSenghanBri> "we need to do this" -> this live here
[17:03:07] <sunjonSenghanBri> yep, I'm totally aware that there's folk such as sean, gundar, and many others that have done this under their own steam
[17:03:47] <sunjonSenghanBri> and I don't want to come across as needing more than what other people have managed with
[17:04:49] <sunjonSenghanBri> it's more from the point of view that things that have been discussed such as mentored projects, are agreed as valuable, but it's quite a personal experience on both ends
[17:06:32] <sunjonSenghanBri> I'd think that a decent overview of the implementation process for something perhaps less complicated, would be a welcome addition to the "getting started" mantra, and hopefully lead to more contributers with less hands-on interaction
[17:07:37] <sunjonSenghanBri> failing that, I nominate Sean for speaking about his experience at VimConf 2022
[17:07:47] <sunjonSenghanBri> one of the two. Choose your fate.

[22:29:37] <clason[m]> and you can reproduce this with `nvim --clean`
[22:30:08] <Rory[m]1> mjlbach[m]: Yes, a side effect of the work ubuntu server being very out of date in the has been that it was moved to dev branch, I'm about to move it back

[22:31:08] <Rory[m]1> * in the past has been
[22:31:30] <clason[m]> OK, then you start adding stuff from your config until it breaks again

[22:36:12] <mjlbach[m]> For reference, 0.7 didn't break anything, that plugin was incorrectly using an API function
[22:36:27] <clason[m]> and hasn't been updated since early December
[22:36:28] <mjlbach[m]> nightly added strict enforcement of api function signature
