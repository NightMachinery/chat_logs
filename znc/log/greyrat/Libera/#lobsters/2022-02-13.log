[06:31:06] <badtuple> about 30,000 users
[06:31:14] <rocx> vastly different approaches to TeX. LaTeX is more of semantics where ConTeXt is about easier control over nearly every aspect of the document (and a lot more lua)

[06:31:33] <rocx> it's a good joke because it's true.

[06:32:49] <vladimyr> lua? isn't it just a set of TeX macros or there is more to it?
[06:33:10] <companion_cube> I thought there was also something about handling unicode
