[00:44:51] <imode> dimadima: 5 miles? put me down for 10.
[00:44:51] <dimadima> man i can't deal w/ topic channels
[00:45:03] <dimadima> i'll do 10, just don't want to alienate the 5 mile crew
[00:45:06] <imode> I'm out of shape but I love me some hiking.
[00:45:09] <dimadima> walking is probably my fave thing
[00:45:36] <dimadima> great thing about living in new york, queens specifically, was walking around for hours if not the whole day
[00:45:55] <dimadima> urban hiking, nature hiking, all great
[00:46:57] <imode> count me out of the urban hiking, I do not like people and cities.
[00:47:49] <dimadima> i'd want to at least try and convince you otherwise, at least with regard to new york
[00:47:54] <dimadima> but hey if your'e truly misanthropic!
[00:48:08] <imode> been there, never want to go back.
[00:48:43] <dimadima> not to press the subject, but one more question?
[00:48:59] <dimadima> did you check out, like, non-manhattan?
[00:49:28] <dimadima> much of manhattan really is little more than a concrete bunghole
[00:49:38] <imode> ..to be honest I put that memory so far out because the experience was so horrible that I forget where I was.
[00:50:08] <dimadima> üëç
[00:50:23] <dimadima> well forget urbant then, nature it is
[00:50:41] <imode> geneva had a "getaway" planned. an offsite.
[00:50:46] <defect> urban hiking kinda implies being in a city, doesn't it?
[00:50:54] <imode> seeing as they're based in new york they flew me out.
[00:52:06] <imode> it was not a fun experience.
[00:57:05] <dimadima> i hate my SLR out on what turned out to be my last walk through queens
[00:57:05] <dimadima> https://i.imgur.com/oVZ2R7T.jpeg
[00:57:08] <dimadima> had*
[00:58:53] <dimadima> that street food, god
[00:59:40] <dimadima> fuck geneva
[01:04:49] <imode> people have to enjoy the microcosm of cities. I wish I could walk around them as if I was invisible.
[01:05:00] <imode> too many people staring at me.
[01:05:06] <dimadima> this righteous food court in flushing https://i.imgur.com/0XCjISQ.jpeg
[01:05:17] <dimadima> i feel you imode
[01:05:25] <ngoldbaum> that area has some world-class chinese food
[01:05:43] <dimadima> i feel pretty invisible in new york but i can imagine how one would not
[01:05:52] <dimadima> i'm just looking at these pics
[01:06:11] <dimadima> october 21, 2018 they are
[01:07:38] <dimadima> SLRs are amazing
[01:08:20] <skyl4rk> single lens reflex?
[01:08:26] <dimadima> yeah
[01:08:42] <dimadima> just a plain canon 5d with a 50mm pro lens
[01:09:06] <skyl4rk> nice
[01:09:58] <dimadima> i forget what they're called, the red lined ones you know
[01:10:45] <skyl4rk> wouldn't say me anything though, I don't really keep up with the releases
[01:12:07] <skyl4rk> looking into a modern slr I miss the split view (split prism?) focusing
[01:12:21] <skyl4rk> does the 5d have a digital or analog viewfinder?
[01:12:37] <dimadima> you can't use the screen as a viewfinder
[01:12:44] <dimadima> have to use the eye piece
[01:14:04] <skyl4rk> analog then I guess, hm I guess it goes without saying if it is called an slr, digital viewfinder might be sl, but not -r
[01:18:55] <dimadima> newer ones have that though, i'm pretty sure
[01:21:22] <dimadima> ppl seem to want that
[01:21:27] <skyl4rk> there are cameras that do, but they wouldn't be called [d]slrs, as they lack many of the components that make an slr an slr(ie https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera#/media/File:SLR_cross_section.svg)
[01:21:28] <buttsbot> Digital single-lens reflex camera - Wikipedia
[01:23:45] <dimadima> i think the 5d mark whatever
[01:23:48] <dimadima> has that
[01:24:00] <dimadima> no idea what the correct nomenclature is though
[01:24:05] <dimadima> and i may be wrong altogrther
[01:26:31] <dimadima> got to get a photos site going
[01:26:48] <dimadima> and go to start shooting with this SLR again
[01:27:02] <skyl4rk> might have live view, in which the mirror is flipped up and shutter curtain opened, and then it's constantly capturing an image and relaying it to the screen on the back
[01:28:24] <skyl4rk> hah, btw, that's my perhaps primary razor when it comes to reinvent-the-web things like gemini or drumming up a second wind for gopher: can I do my photo blog with it? ...so far the answer is no unless I severely change what I mean with a photo block
[01:28:58] <skyl4rk> (not that I really have a photo blog anyway, but you know, the one I'm going to make, like ...soon)
[01:29:28] <dimadima> yeah the no images thing
[01:29:37] <dimadima> sucks
[01:29:49] <dimadima> and re-doing the web is something i'm all for, that would be awesome
[01:30:04] <dimadima> i'm even fine with no inline links! but-- no images??
[01:30:06] <dimadima> we're only human

[02:57:34] <imode> paid. I hold way too much animosity towards this job right now. and I haven't had a "day off" since march.
[03:07:20] <defect> how long?
[03:07:29] <imode> two weeks to a month.
[03:07:34] <Church> Ouch
[03:09:33] <dimadima> why wouldn't that be billed as a vacation?

[03:42:25] <companion_cube> cool, TIL
[03:42:38] <companion_cube> I guess it's not happening in practice though
[03:42:45] <companion_cube> light tends to escape quickly :p
[03:47:38] <ngoldbaum> yeah there aren‚Äôt a lot of natural processes that focus light to such a high energy density
[03:50:18] <companion_cube> so is that what people were worried about when they feared CERN would create a black hole?
[04:20:38] <hoistbypetard> ngoldbaum: that candidate is one of our area kooks
[04:21:07] <hoistbypetard> i see her riding her bike around all the time... i'm actually astonished there was a traffic citation for them to look up that had conflicting info
[04:21:43] <hoistbypetard> she runs for office *every* time there's a local election. school board, county board, etc. i think she'd run for dog catcher if we still elected those
[04:22:05] <hoistbypetard> sometimes she runs as green, sometimes independent
[04:22:18] <ngoldbaum> she has achieved independence
[04:23:24] <hoistbypetard> i made her mad a week and a half ago when she was handing out flyers at our farmers' market, and i declined with the observation that her volunteers had already littered three copies of it into my yard :)

[04:42:01] <ngoldbaum> hoistbypetard: how pissed off must she be that wapo published her birthdate
[04:45:26] <hoistbypetard> she's already quite certain the world is conspiring against her. this must cement it. next time she starts a conversation with me about one of her campaigns i plan to inquire.
[04:46:06] <hoistbypetard> (that makes it sound like i dislike her more than i do... she's a completely harmless kook, and we come down on the same side of quite a few issues.)
[04:54:07] <Xe> sometimes i wonder if i am wasting my time trying to go full nixos for things
[05:02:50] <dimadima> imode: how you feeling about that
[05:03:18] <dimadima> imode: vacations, if you haven't been off since march with 500 issues a week, are pretty normal and even necessary
[05:08:36] <dimadima> not like you don't know that, just lame it's a "leave of absence"
[05:11:05] <Church> Xe: What's broken now?
[05:11:25] <Xe> not anything in particular
[05:11:28] <Xe> just
[05:11:31] <Xe> fuck
[05:11:53] <Church> I thankfully barely have issues. My machines just sit there and coldly do their job.
[05:12:20] <dimadima> stoic
[05:14:07] <Xe> i think it's some kind of like existential hopelessness or something
[05:22:43] <dimadima> with regard to nix?
[05:26:56] <Xe> idk if it's just that, old wounds got metaphorically ripped open earlier today
[05:29:24] <Xe> i think i was abused as a child in a way that was disguised as punishment
[05:31:38] <Church> Ah that's... ouch?
[05:35:43] <imode> a lot of problems at work can be traced back to other stuff.
[05:35:56] <imode> motivations decay into "why do I feel like shit" and then you play detective.
[05:36:11] <imode> dimadima: I'm indifferent. I need the time. my manager agrees I need the time. there was an incident this summer I never recovered from.
[05:36:11] <dimadima> Xe: so the nix isn't even related to nix?
[05:36:48] <dimadima> how'd they get ripped open
[05:36:48] <Xe> i have no idea
[05:37:44] <imode> load bearing people often collapse.
[05:37:59] <dimadima> imode: you or Xe?
[05:38:28] <imode> both?
[05:44:42] <defect> what's the difference between vacation and leave of absence? the latter doesn't count towards your accrued PTO?
[05:45:11] <imode>  the latter is unpaid.
[05:52:45] <dimadima> how soon will you find out
[05:53:12] <imode> Xe: do you have a solid therapist?
[05:53:36] <Xe> apparently i need one more than i thought i did lol
[05:53:42] <imode> saaaaaaaaame.
[06:02:37] <Xe> however that would explain the nightmares i've had for years
[06:04:17] <dimadima> what would explain
[06:07:38] <dimadima> sorry i'll stop asking questions
[06:09:01] <dimadima> i had my first automated fraud-type thing occur today. has been a hybrid fun/interesting/irritating
[06:09:38] <dimadima> nice thing about having a non-instant messaging app is you can really analyze things before they hit users
[06:10:14] <dimadima> also really, really glad i took the 2 hours to migrate from serial int IDS to uuids like the day before i first soft launched
[06:10:30] <dimadima> i have a feeling that will be a small investment that might pay off big
[06:17:22] <drakonis> ah, existential dread.
[06:17:23] <drakonis> the worst.
[06:18:26] <imode> yeeeee.
[06:18:48] <dimadima> it's terrible
[06:21:21] <drakonis> i want a stable source of income so i can become a goat farmer
[06:21:31] <drakonis> it seems like a really chill thing to do
[06:21:48] <drakonis> everything is so stressful
[06:21:59] <imode> goat farming is also stressful.
[06:22:09] <drakonis> the obsessive need to be successful is killing me
[06:22:11] <drakonis> also money
[06:22:32] <drakonis> needing to make money all the time to not mooch off my parents until i can make enough to live by myself
[06:22:39] <imode> the obsession wears off.
[06:22:44] <imode> the need for money doesn't.
[06:23:01] <dimadima> goats are fucking crazy
[06:23:14] <drakonis> i'm getting older and i'm still not living alone
[06:23:24] <drakonis> also billygoats seem to be really cute
[06:23:32] <imode> how old are you.
[06:23:36] <drakonis> 27
[06:23:42] <drakonis> not in america
[06:23:56] <drakonis> baby goats are v. cute
[06:23:57] <imode> I'm nearly 26 and I only just "got out on my own" last year.
[06:24:01] <imode> so.
[06:24:05] <imode> you'll get there.
[06:24:10] <imode> and it's not that glamorous. it's nice. but.
[06:24:25] <drakonis> something about their size and how they move
[06:25:22] <drakonis> the thing about living alone is that i don't have to deal with them calling me for help with computer shit on a daily basis
[06:25:31] <drakonis> also living on their schedule
[06:25:54] <imode> meh. that'll always happen.
[06:26:09] <imode> just operate via texts and remote desktop.
[06:26:20] <drakonis> haha well they're really bad at computers
[06:26:32] <imode> yeeeeep.
[06:28:13] <drakonis> i wonder how long they'd last without me being there to help them with everything
[06:28:47] <imode> that's why I have my parents' computers wired up with tinc.
[06:29:27] <drakonis> my mom is deathly afraid of using a computer
[06:29:35] <drakonis> she thinks if she does something wrong, its going to get bricked
[06:29:40] <drakonis> she's got a chromebook
[06:29:43] <imode> hah.
[06:30:09] <imode> I mean.. she's not wrong. none of these interfaces are "oops"-proof.
[06:30:54] <drakonis> my dad only uses an iphone and occasionally boots up a windows lappy for some spreadsheet stuff
[06:31:20] <drakonis> they forget how to use computers pretty fast tbh
[06:31:31] <drakonis> my mom asks me how to do things she does at least once a week
[06:31:36] <drakonis> rather
[06:31:38] <drakonis> rather
[06:32:05] <drakonis> there's things she does on a daily basis and weekly basis, but yet she asks me about it multiple times
[06:33:11] <drakonis> it gets very tiring to have to repeat it a lot and i've gotten to a point where i get angry sometimes
[06:33:48] <imode> remote desktop, dude.
[06:33:55] <imode> VNC for me.
[06:34:03] <imode> it's easier if you can just... show by demonstration.
[06:34:05] <drakonis> i wonder how i can set that shit up
[06:34:11] <imode> or do it on your own.
[06:34:22] <drakonis> she doesnt want me to touch the device, she wants me to explain it to her
[06:34:29] <drakonis> and that takes time away from other tasks
[06:34:31] <imode> hahaha.
[06:34:43] <drakonis> im dying inside mom
[06:34:51] <drakonis> s/inside/inside,
[06:35:04] <imode> yeah mine does that too... eventually I level with her and say "this is something you shouldn't need to do on your own, these interfaces suck and I'm doing this to help you".
[06:36:44] <drakonis> i relish when my parents go on a vacation
[06:36:56] <drakonis> its a relief to not have them interrupt me often
[06:37:20] <imode> you'll miss them when they're gone for longer than a year.
[06:37:34] <imode> I haven't seen mine in about a year and a half. maybe more..
[06:37:40] <drakonis> probably.
[06:37:59] <drakonis> i hadn't physically seen my brother in circa 2 years
[06:38:02] <drakonis> he showed up last week lol
[06:38:15] <drakonis> thanks 'rona
[06:38:57] <imode> mood.
[06:39:08] <drakonis> it was good to see him

[07:00:43] <imode> oh I love 'em.
[07:01:21] <imode> I've seen them maybe once outside. they're afraid of catching COVID, even though we're all vaccinated.
[07:01:38] <dimadima> so they're afraid of the 20 ft outdoor chill?
[07:01:50] <dimadima> i used to chill w/ ppl like that before vaccines
[07:02:03] <dimadima> it was terribly alienating and made me hating everything
[07:02:06] <imode> we did it once. that's not really seeing your parents.
[07:02:25] <dimadima> yeah
[07:02:25] <imode> you can't hug them, you can't spend time with them, you can't talk to them normally.
[07:02:30] <dimadima> yep
[07:03:01] <dimadima> anyway man
[07:03:03] <dimadima> i'm sorry
[07:03:07] <dimadima> that's a bummer
[07:03:07] <imode> it's alright.
[07:03:23] <imode> there's some positive notes. I may be able to see them in november, stay over there for a while.
[07:03:31] <imode> that and december.
[07:03:37] <dimadima> i hope you do
[07:03:53] <dimadima> my wife hasn't seen her parents in 3 years or something like that
[07:03:58] <dimadima> and they haven't seen our child
[07:04:14] <dimadima> and they don't even believe in covid
[07:04:32] <imode> yikes. that qualifies them as dead to me, tbh.
[07:04:57] <dimadima> same, but since they're my in-laws they're the only exception to that rule for me
[07:05:05] <imode> fair.
[07:05:12] <dimadima> i am, like, obligated to give them endless passes for anything
[07:05:25] <dimadima> which they don't reciprocate for me <3
[07:05:43] <dimadima> but hey, take the high road i tell myself
[07:06:08] <dimadima> i'm not _actively_ trying to see them though, cause fuck them touching my child
[07:06:12] <dimadima> sad as that may be
[07:06:16] <dimadima> with their corona breath
[07:06:26] <dimadima> exaggerating for effect but, you know
[07:06:43] <dimadima> it's all difficult to process when i start thinking about it
[07:07:02] <dimadima> anyway i'm going t focus a bit
[07:07:41] <imode> cheers, man. these past years have been incredibly difficult to process.
[07:07:49] <imode> you're a wonderful person, fwiw.
[07:08:45] <dimadima> heh, i'm a terribly mixed bag, but thanks a lot imode, you too
[07:08:54] <dimadima> you are* too

[16:44:50] <companion_cube> ooooh I
[16:44:56] <companion_cube> I missed the domain name
[16:47:25] <kline> its true though
[16:47:32] <kline> auto-closing issues is really fucking stupid
[16:50:18] <gwozniak> We certainly don't auto-close issues at work
[16:50:28] <ngoldbaum> you should start your own project with hookers and booze then
[16:51:29] <deadk> i don't think auto-closing issues is stupid really
[16:51:41] <riv> i dont understand the benefit
[16:52:44] <deadk> a lot of issues on github projects just sit waiting forever for OP to answer a question
[16:53:00] <riv> ah
[16:53:08] <deadk> of course a human can go through and clean those up, but it's a very boring job
[16:53:53] <riv> yeah
[16:54:06] <ngoldbaum> it‚Äôs almost like most projects are hobby porjects with limited resources
[16:54:24] <ngoldbaum> and filing an issue isn‚Äôt a promise by the maintainers to fix whatever you‚Äôre reporting
[16:54:38] <gerikson> ``It unnecessarily invalidates the experience of users who have their provided valuable time to report something to your software project.'' LOL
[16:54:57] <gerikson> incorrect sentiment and incorrect grammar
[16:55:28] <ngoldbaum> i don‚Äôt really care if a project uses a stale bot or not btw
[16:55:28] <riv> lol
[16:55:41] <ngoldbaum> it‚Äôs the attitude in the HN comments i despise
[16:55:53] <gerikson> I hope we can all join together in that
[16:55:53] <ngoldbaum> that they‚Äôre owed anything at all by the maintainers
[16:55:58] <gerikson> whatevr our differences
[16:56:02] <gerikson> we can all agree
[16:56:06] <gerikson> HN SUX
[16:58:38] <gwozniak> If you want to see how cruft accumulates in programming languages and libraries, look no further than customers
[16:59:21] <gwozniak> We have to add some non-standard headers to our library (and maintain them...) because some customers are using them
[17:00:15] <gwozniak> The code is probably ancient, too
[17:23:05] <gthm> some of our customers use xml to talk to us. some of them ignore namespaces, some of them don't. some of them rely on attributes being in a certain order, which the standard says isn't important. some of them rely on our xml parsing being... special to send certain information as either child elements or attributes of a given element
[17:23:10] <gthm> customers are fun
[17:24:51] <gwozniak> Really, I think the dislike of "enterprise" stuff comes from the fact that it accommodates all the insane customer stuff out there
[17:26:16] <kline> i dont think maintainers have to resolve any issue opened
[17:26:17] <gwozniak> "We built our system on sand. Now maintain that sand"
[17:26:25] <kline> but closing/locking it without any kind of resolution is silly
[17:26:31] <kline> just leave it open, whats the problem?
[17:27:08] <kline> its not golf, theres no penalty to having biggus numerus
[17:27:28] <ngoldbaum> clutters the namespace with years-old un-actionable issues the maintainers don‚Äôt care about
[17:27:31] <companion_cube> but then people will open issues to say "too many issues, is this maintained?"
[17:31:28] <dimadima> i set up stale bot on my lone project but failed to correctly set the "pinned" label and have lacked time to figure it out; so it's auto-closed this one issue i want open
[17:31:31] <dimadima> and that's been frustrating
[17:31:55] <dimadima> the only reason i set it up was so that i could be passive aggressive with people who opened thoughtless issues
[17:32:13] <dimadima> like really dumb shit, where i'd otherwise have to just close it personally
[17:32:43] <dimadima> i know "really dumb shit" sounds offesnive, but i'm talking like "absolute zero effort"
[17:32:58] <dimadima> stale bot is good for not having to have those interactions
[17:33:06] <dimadima> with people who don't deserve them
[17:35:10] <companion_cube> after reading some HN comments
[17:35:25] <companion_cube> I wonder if the stalebot could only work on "needs reporter action" issues with no answer?
[17:35:31] <companion_cube> that'd be reasonable I think
[17:35:36] <companion_cube> kind of opt-in
[17:35:57] <dimadima> yeah it can, you just need to configure it correctly
[17:36:17] <dimadima> i think that's the way to go. just add the
[17:36:26] <dimadima> "needs reporter action" - and forget about it
[17:36:34] <dimadima> sorry i keep hitting <enter> by accident
[17:37:50] <companion_cube> yeah that'd make sense
[17:38:01] <companion_cube> but I've never had issues with, eh, too many issues
[17:38:30] <dimadima> yeah that's rare
[17:38:45] <companion_cube> unrelatedly, I'm still typing super badly (and making lots of mistakes), and I've tried learning proper touch typing, but it's so fucking HARD
[17:38:52] <companion_cube> to lose all your muscle memory
[17:39:19] <riv> if you want to you should switch keyboard layout, not knowing the keys makes it easier to learn touch typing
[17:39:38] <riv> and they stick with that long enough to forget qwerty and then learn touch typing with qwerty
[17:40:35] <companion_cube> yeah but I have a job :/
[17:40:46] <companion_cube> I can't like take a month off until I can write code again
[17:41:04] <companion_cube> it just suuuucks
[17:41:23] <dimadima> that was like when i learned vim, i just committed myself not being able to program for a while
[17:42:03] <dimadima> not something i could ever do now
[17:42:48] <gerikson> oh god everyone is talking about "consumers"
[17:42:56] <companion_cube> I mean I've vaguely tried to type properly at least on IRC
[17:43:02] <companion_cube> but man
[17:43:09] <companion_cube> the patience

[18:25:51] <dimadima> you forget it*
[18:26:28] <dimadima> you have to have a pretty light, efficient vehicle to get anywhere near 42mpg though, i believe

[18:26:54] <dimadima> i'm not sure that phenomenon is US-specific
[18:29:57] <deadk> no, but i think gas is quite cheap in the US
[18:30:45] <dimadima> yeah i think it's the cheapest in the "developed world" by a lot
[18:31:04] <dimadima> fun thing i learned the other day is that CA taxes you for having an EV
[18:31:09] <deadk> VW makes petrol cars that do >50mpg combined so i'm pretty sure the cheaty diesels could have done better than that
[18:31:18] <deadk> (but it's not just VW)
[18:32:11] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: yeah gas taxes pay for roads, once gas cars go away still gotta pay for roads
[18:32:41] <deadk> well, you can also pay for roads with... taxes
[18:32:45] <deadk> it doesn't have to be usage-based
[18:33:22] <deadk> and i'm not really a fan of public infrastructure needing to be justified like this, but i think even non-road-users benefit from there being a functioning road system
[18:36:26] <ngoldbaum> well until then gas taxes pay for roads and electric cars shouldn‚Äôt get let off the hook just because of their power plant

[20:31:41] <drakonis> i gotta get one of these
[20:38:34] <drakonis> https://twitter.com/fairy_godslut/status/1453013718019805184
[20:38:34] <buttsbot> Twitter - fairy_godslut - What in the honest to god fuck is going on here   https://t.co/SLHcOEUUds https://t.co/u59SUrKgu0
[20:38:36] <drakonis> what the fuck?
[20:39:44] <indigo> I'm curious what that "combined" number means
[20:41:16] <indigo> Also this is interesting if true https://twitter.com/eggbass/status/1452772066860535808
[20:41:16] <buttsbot> Twitter - eggbass - @andysomerfield @affinitybyserif and a 5500M outperformed that w6900x as well which goes to show you how useful of a benchmark this is to indicate gpu perf. (hint: it's useless)
[20:42:14] <drakonis> a burn..........
[20:42:23] <bkero> press x to doubt
[20:42:40] <indigo> I wonder what the benchmark is even measuring
[20:43:07] <indigo> But hey, M1 Max has the best numbers
[20:44:12] <Brekkjern> I'm betting that x86 is losing ground because most processors, mobos and other components are made for modularity, while the M1 chip is purpose built for one platform, soldered to the same chip.
[20:44:37] <imode> drakonis: THE CUUUUUUUBE.
[20:44:43] <imode> it's secretly a crowdfunded allspark.
[20:44:44] <Brekkjern> Like, Intel don't know what people will be using their CPU/GPUs for. They can only make an educated guess based on what sells.
[20:44:57] <bkero> lol
[20:45:08] <drakonis> intel arc when
[20:45:31] <companion_cube> Brekkjern: but does apple know what the M1 will be used for?
[20:45:40] <companion_cube> I mean it's still general purpose computing
[20:45:47] <Brekkjern> companion_cube: They know what hardware it will be integrating with and how it will do it.
[20:46:03] <bkero> You mean like the Ultrabook standard?
[20:46:11] <companion_cube> sure, you can get some gains this way, I'm sure
[20:46:12] <Brekkjern> companion_cube: I'm not talking about software
[20:46:15] <skyl4rk> the real question is how many fps can I get in glxgears
[20:46:18] <companion_cube> ah I see.
[20:46:27] <imode> seven billion.
[20:46:40] <companion_cube> although I'm fairly confident that they pushed the atomics performance because Apple's code uses a ton of them with ARC
[20:46:54] <bkero> Their general purpose computing hardware still has crypto acceleration and av transcodinf
[20:47:05] <bkero> transcoding*
[20:47:21] <bkero> those are fairly purpose-specific
[20:47:27] <indigo> I thought M1 is "better" because it has insane mem bandwidth
[20:47:45] <Brekkjern> Memory bandwidth is underrated
[20:48:07] <bkero> memory frequency is more important here
[20:48:15] <bkero> or rather, latency
[20:48:40] <Brekkjern> Well, you've now mentioned most of the factors that determine bandwidth :P
[20:50:02] <indigo> Woof, looks like the M1 Pro uses DDR5 at 6400MHz
[20:50:08] <indigo> That's pretty frequent
[20:50:27] <phytyca> 6ghz memory...holy cow
[20:50:31] <indigo> More than double the RAM speed of a 16" MBP
[20:50:46] <bkero> uhh
[20:50:57] <bkero> are you sure thats the frequency?
[20:51:09] <bkero> or is that the DDR speed?
[20:51:14] <Brekkjern> Is DDR5 available for consumer PCs yet?
[20:51:30] <bkero> GDDR5 has been out for half a decade or so
[20:51:33] <Brekkjern> I mean, not integrated, but as chips
[20:51:38] <bkero> but again, latency
[20:51:39] <Brekkjern> GDDR and DDR are not the same things
[20:51:46] <indigo> Oh my bad, it is MT/s, not MHz
[20:52:03] <indigo> So divide by two (double data rate), you get 3200MHz
[20:52:07] <bkero> Yes, a DDR memory chip transfers at the rising and falling clock edge
[20:52:54] <companion_cube> :o wow
[20:53:12] <dimadima> drakonis: wtf *is* even going on in cube tweet
[20:53:35] <drakonis> madness
[20:53:44] <drakonis> that way lies madness
[20:54:34] <Brekkjern> I kinda want to upgrade my computer, but... eh...
[20:55:16] <indigo> Brekkjern: Wait for M2!
[20:55:30] <Brekkjern> indigo: M2?
[20:55:42] <bkero> Kingston appears to be selling DDR5 dimms and sodimms
[20:55:44] <indigo> 2022 Macbook air
[20:55:50] <Brekkjern> indigo: I don't use Mac
[20:56:32] <indigo> What??? Next you're going to tell me that you don't think cryptocurrency is the savior of the global economy, and that Gemini isn't the future
[20:56:44] <gwozniak> pfft
[20:56:44] <companion_cube> I wonder what the intersection of gemini and bitcoin is
[20:56:59] <Brekkjern> My computer is kinda bottlenecked by the 4xPCIe to the storage
[20:57:17] <Brekkjern> Or rather, to the peripheral hub
[21:00:54] <bkero> can you add another?
[21:01:22] <Brekkjern> It's built into the motherboard
[21:01:30] <bkero> Yes
[21:01:42] <bkero> and motherboards typically have expansion slots
[21:01:51] <bkero> including PCI Express
[21:02:03] <Brekkjern> My mobo only has 1 PCIe slot
[21:02:14] <bkero> Ah, that would do it
[21:03:02] <Brekkjern> It has 2x M.2 slots, but they both go through the same 4xPCIe bus that also handles the NIC, USB, audio, and so on.
[21:04:37] <deadk> it's pretty usual for motherboards to have more lanes wired up than they can run simultaneously
[21:05:11] <Brekkjern> Not really. Loads of mobos with 16/8x slots
[21:05:44] <deadk> i mean, that doesn't contradict what i said
[21:05:46] <bkero> Intel skimps on them
[21:05:51] <Brekkjern> Yep
[21:06:00] <bkero> Intel's io hub is wired through an 8x slot
[21:06:15] <Brekkjern> It's an 8x? I thought it was a 4x
[21:06:17] <bkero> but typically they cheap out on the rest
[21:06:35] <bkero> My understanding was 8x, but that might be stale info
[21:06:48] <Brekkjern> I dunno
[21:07:15] <deadk> it's pretty common for such motherboards to have 16x slots and 8x slots, but not enough total lanes to run them all at capacity at once
[21:07:34] <deadk> mine has a bios setting
[21:08:27] <deadk> but my motherboard is from the days when the only way to get multiple 16x slots with intel was with PLX's magic bridge, and i couldn't afford that
[21:13:18] <bkero> If we take a look at something relatively recent, you can see it only has 16 available lanes (plus the 8 or 4 for it's own io hub): https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/186604/intel-core-i79700k-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-90-ghz.html
[21:13:19] <buttsbot> Intel Core i79700K Processor 12M Cache up to 4.90 GHz Product Specifications
[21:13:32] <bkero> and that's a desktop chip
[21:14:42] <gerikson> companion_cube: at least one poster on gemini was like "well sure bitcoin uses a lot of energy but what about CHROME TABS hmmmmm?!"
[21:14:42] <buttsbot> More like buttcoin, am I rite!?
[21:15:13] <Brekkjern> bkero: Where do you see the details about the IO hub?
[21:15:16] <companion_cube> gerikson: :DDD
[21:15:34] <companion_cube> plz do a napkin computation of the difference, bro
[21:17:04] <bkero> Brekkjern: I asked some Intel engineers, and I believe it's available in some architecture documents.
[21:17:53] <Brekkjern> Mkay
[21:18:26] <Brekkjern> I have an 8700K and it does the job mostly, but I'm going to look for something with more PCIe lanes on my next machine
[21:19:13] <Brekkjern> And I'll probably not go with an m-ITX mobo next time either :P
[21:49:04] <cb_> whenever i see "permacomputing" i've mentally substituted it for "anprim urbit"
[21:49:56] <imode> ...permacomputing?
[21:51:31] <cb_> https://society.robinsloan.com/archive/slab/
[21:51:31] <buttsbot> The slab and the permacomputer
[21:52:18] <imode> wtf is this drivvel.
[21:52:47] <imode> oh god they mention uxn.
[21:55:56] <imode> there's this giant push to want to build something that lasts as long as the pyramids in computing, but everybody that wants that.. is still tied to the specifics of electronic computers.
[21:56:16] <imode> if you want to build a "permacomputer", stop building your model of programming on top of electronic computers.
[21:56:27] <bkero> Brekkjern: Definitely have to go up to at least Micro-ATX to get more ports, and check out AMD's offerings. Unlike Intel they don't neuter the amount of lanes on their consumer chips.
[21:56:44] <imode> or model of operating. we had human computers for thousands of years before we had mechanical computers. and mechanical computers for decades before electromechanical.
[21:56:44] <bkero> Although I hear Intel is better about that for the 11th gen too (should doublecheck though)

[22:02:53] <imode> "not allowed to say" sounds like something you need to say.

[22:21:49] <gwozniak> woohoo! More DNS issues with Docker
[22:23:36] <Brekkjern> In Docker? You don't say? :P
[22:24:18] <gwozniak> It's probably the case that if I weren't on the VPN then resolution will work, but since I need to access something in the VPN...
[22:27:24] <gwozniak> I'm running docker in my Linux VM, and the Linux VM has no problems.  Of course...
[22:32:11] <imode> don't you have to do something like rely on host networking.
[22:33:24] <gwozniak> I'll give that a shot...
[22:34:09] <gwozniak> oh good, that works
[22:34:12] <gwozniak> thanks
[22:35:57] <imode> np.
[23:06:00] <ngoldbaum> i do love how to use docker you also have to be an expert in the linux networking stack to do anything that touches the internet
[23:06:44] <Brekkjern> Or the file system...
