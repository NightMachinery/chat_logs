[00:35:11] <InPhase> cart_: Also, more generally, it makes sure buffers are thoroughly dumped to screen, which can be important when the time of delivery of information is important.
[00:35:48] <InPhase> cart_: Also, it's pretty helpful to make sure you finished flushing before you're about to go and do a segfault, so this can be important for debugging sometimes, as well as human interaction.
[00:36:24] <cart_> InPhase: Ok but if I am not mistaken std::endl does the same thing accept for appending stuff?
[00:36:38] <InPhase> Do enough print debugging, and sooner or later you'll forget to do a flush before a segfault, and you'll convince yourself it happens somewhere other than where it looks like it did.
[00:36:54] <InPhase> other than where it actually did, I mean.
[00:37:06] <InPhase> cart_: std::endl is an newline plus a flush, yes.
[00:37:23] <InPhase> So sometimes you should use \n to avoid the flush, as the flushing slows things down.
[00:37:50] <InPhase> So you can do a whole bunch of lines with \n for speed, then switch to a flush at the end point to guarantee delivery, giving you more nuanced control.
[00:37:58] <cart_> InPhase: Ahh I seee... I dont know why but I have always used std::endl; anyway
[00:38:06] <cart_> InPhase: Ahh I see \
[00:38:07] <cart_> makes sense
[00:38:17] <InPhase> It's commonly taught to beginners as endl, because the flushing keeps them from getting confused.  :)
[00:38:29] <PJBoy> I don't think that's why
[00:39:22] <InPhase> Not confusing them sure sounds helpful to me.  I'm not sure if one or the other is different in how confusing it is.
[00:39:49] <PJBoy> it would be a good reason, I just reckon people teach it out of ignorance / habit
[00:40:39] <InPhase> endl is more plain languge, which is how it started being taught back in the day.  But these days "std::endl" gets kind of wordy for a beginner.
[00:42:00] <OnlineCop> I've run into logging situations where flushing between every newline causes some noticeable slowdowns; we usually batch a dozen or so lines and flush them in one go.
[00:43:28] <InPhase> I still vividly remember the day I upgraded my compiler and cout was no longer recognized, and I ended up in a scramble searching the web to figure out why the compiler was "broken".  It was a different era for how information ended up trickling out.

[00:45:44] <InPhase> OnlineCop: Yeah, I find it significant a lot in logging scenarios.

[00:47:05] <OnlineCop> Generating multi-GB CSV files with a flush between each line was taking us 10 seconds. Flushing every Nth newline dropped that to under 700ms.
[00:47:19] <InPhase> Sounds about right.  :)
[00:48:48] <InPhase> Code from one of my recent logging routines.  i.e., flush if 5 seconds passed since the last time it was done.  if (last_flush.SinceStart() > 5) { fw.Flush(); last_flush.Start(); }
[00:49:31] <OnlineCop> I'd HATE to sit on a toilet that does that.
[00:49:44] <InPhase> I have sat on toilets that do that...
[00:50:08] <OnlineCop> The kind that try to sense whether someone's there or not, and can't tell that you're simply shifting so your leg doesn't fall asleep?

[20:39:50] <whupdup> Hey, I have a question about some weird behavior I'm experiencing. I have a class Buffer { RenderContext& context; };, RenderContext has its copy/move ctors deleted, Buffer has an explicit move ctor. When I do `context = other.context` in Buffer::Buffer(&&), it tells me `error: use of deleted function 'void RenderContext::operator=(const RenderContext&)'`... but I'm trying to copy a reference, not copy by value. Why
[20:39:50] <whupdup> does it think I'm copying by value?

[20:56:42] <Alipha> whupdup: you can't change where a reference refers to after initialization. Use a pointer instead
[20:57:54] *** flooded is now known as _flood
[20:57:56] <whupdup> oh rip, I thought I was being fancy and using refs as nonnull ptrs
[20:58:38] <Alipha> whupdup: references as members is generally a bad idea for this reason
[21:01:24] *** Joins: NiD27 (~nid27@49.205.148.184)
[21:02:41] <InPhase> whupdup: First, be very wary about your ownership hierarchy and lifetimes whenever you have reference members OR raw pointers as members.  It is imposing an architectural constraint that can make code maintenance challenging or fragile.  Following well-defined ownership models with members is the better choice whenever possible.  That warning aside, you can also consider this:

[21:08:01] <InPhase> Wow...  What is up with putting this monstrosity in the reference_wrapper example on that cppreference page?  for (std::cout << rem; auto const& e : v)  std::cout << e << ' ';
[21:08:55] *** Quits: varioust (~varioust@gateway/tor-sasl/varioust) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[21:09:31] <InPhase> Usually cppreference is better about having clean fairly idiomatic examples.
[21:09:47] <whupdup> does it provide any benefits if you're using std::reference_wrapper though? My assumption was that by using a ref type I'd be able to clearly signify to the compiler nonnull-ness where it could optimize from
[21:10:47] <whupdup> as opposed to a raw ptr you just assume is not null because its lifetime is assured and it was nonnull upon entry to your class
[21:11:34] *** Joins: fldme (~fldme@178.49.152.151)
[21:14:04] <InPhase> whupdup: Well "reference_wrapper" is basically a misnamed non-nullable pointer type.
[21:14:54] <InPhase> whupdup: Although you can also whip up your own smart pointers with any set of chosen guarantees that exactly match your scenario.  This is something I often do.
[21:15:25] <whupdup> are modern compilers able to see through that and use it to make assumptions about nullness though?
[21:15:32] <InPhase> The instinct is correct to try to provide a set of guarantees with lower level pieces.  You just want to get it correct.
[21:16:12] <InPhase> Well the compilers assume all pointers that are dereferenced are not null, so there's not really a challenge there.
[21:16:45] <InPhase> You just have to set it up so that it can't be constructed without being assigned to an object.
[21:17:47] <InPhase> This is then done by only taking a reference to construct it or to assign it.  Then as long as the rest of your program is well-defined, it will never be null.
