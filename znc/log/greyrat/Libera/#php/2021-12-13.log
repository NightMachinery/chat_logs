[00:20:17] <sbrothy> is it normal that I cant install php-tidy (im running php7.4.3). Installing php-tidy (and php7.4-tidy) leaves me with no include file in /use/share
[00:22:36] <TinoDidriksen> Why would you expect a file in /usr/share ?
[00:23:51] <TinoDidriksen> https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/amd64/php7.4-tidy/filelist are the files php-tidy installs.
[00:24:51] <sbrothy> shouldnt i get an include file for php?

[00:45:42] <sbrothy> hah. i coudnlt make geshi apply highlighting to some bash code but it works if it's loaded from an .sh file. hmmm...
[00:45:51] <sbrothy> nah its probably me. nvm.
[00:50:38] <Agiofws> hello this might seem a simple question but how would i set   $newapp['redirecturi'] = site_url();     to  www.foobar.com ?
[00:51:06] <Agiofws> https://pastebin.com/ykAZkCYB ?
[00:51:55] <da_wunder> so make that `site_url()` function to return that value
[00:52:37] <Agiofws> could i just do $newapp['redirecturi'] ="foobar.com" ?
[00:52:50] <da_wunder> or at least share that function with us - we cannot know what you're doing there
[00:53:05] <Agiofws> ok look for the function
[00:54:13] <da_wunder> and sure you could just do that `$newapp['redirecturi'] ="foobar.com"` but I think that you won't want to do that, eg. if same url is used on dev, test, staging, production environments that won't just work
[00:54:53] <Agiofws> i'm trying to set a redirect url to a custom one because the plugin defaults to my domain name
[00:55:02] <AllenJB> Agiofws: If you're using a framework, let us know what that is. site_url() is not a native PHP function.
[00:55:09] <Agiofws> no where would  that function be
[00:56:01] <da_wunder> with phpstorm you should be just able to CTRL + Click that funtion to go proper place
[00:56:15] <Agiofws> its setting the redirect url to my  domain names site
[00:56:26] <Agiofws> maybe its in another file though
[00:56:36] <da_wunder> look what that function is doing
[00:58:38] <Agiofws> da_wunder jQuery("#callbackurl").val("<?php echo site_url();?>");  ?
[00:58:56] <Agiofws> its echoing my wordpress site url
[00:59:00] <da_wunder> that is not php code...
[01:00:21] <da_wunder> but now you shared that you're using WordPress - right?
[01:00:30] <Agiofws> yes
[01:00:33] <da_wunder> and if that is the use case then look - https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/site_url/
[01:00:41] <Blondie101010> Agiofws:  that is not how it works...  if you want JS to call PHP, you need to do an HTTP request or use a persistent connection like websockets
[01:00:49] <Agiofws> its a wordpress plugin i'm trying to customize
[01:01:05] <Blondie101010> that doesn't change how it can work
[01:01:16] <Blondie101010> does that plugin do AJAX?
[01:01:32] <Blondie101010> well you have jquery so yeah I guess
[01:02:01] <Blondie101010> ohhhh
[01:02:11] <da_wunder> with that `$newapp['redirecturi'] = site_url();` you could easily change that variable to have any value that you want - but with that `23:28 < Agiofws> da_wunder jQuery("#callbackurl").val("<?php echo site_url();?>");  ?` I'm not so sure - assuming that is not code that you've writed
[01:02:13] <Blondie101010> I misunderstood your situation
[01:02:42] <Blondie101010> there's no need to use PHP to insert the URL there
[01:02:57] <Blondie101010> it's bad practice to generate code from other languages

[04:40:06] <berndj> is there some list () syntax variant that assigns "all the remaining rest of the RHS" to the last LHS variable?
[04:40:45] <berndj> like in perl you can: my ($foo, $bar, @baz) = 1..10;
[04:41:47] <__adrian> no, but you could simply shift the first few off
[04:42:19] <berndj> yeah, that's still manageable with a "small" number of fixed leading elements, which is all i have for now...
[04:42:47] <__adrian> you could also use a generator i suppose
[04:44:42] <berndj> i guess i could list ($a, $b, $c) = array_splice($argv, 0, 3)?

[05:13:32] <berndj> is there a way to distinguish the unserialize('b:0;') from unserialize('random crap')? sure i can avoid the E_NOTICE crapping on the screen with @, but that doesn't tell me whether the FALSE return is "real" or a result of garbage input
[05:17:37] <Blondie101010> just don't serialize false and it will prevent that kind of problem
[05:17:56] <Blondie101010> ie: define some structure, or pass the actual value
[05:18:18] <__adrian> kinda wonder why that would come up  ;)  but you could simply check the serialized string first
[05:19:24] <berndj> i'm making a diagnostic tool to fetch some argv-provided keys from a file and just print them in a human-friendly way; some things are stored as serialize($foo) and some aren't depending on type
[05:20:00] <berndj> i guess i could preg_match on /^\w:/ and guess right most of the time
[05:20:03] <__adrian> function better_unserialize(string $s) { $v = unserialize($s); if ($v === false && $s !== serialize(false)) { throw ; } return $v; }
[05:20:17] <__adrian> *@
[05:20:35] <Blondie101010> good idea
[05:21:56] <__adrian> i'd also hope you're aware that unserializing untrusted strings is a Bad Idea™
[05:22:52] <berndj> they're not untrusted, i serialized them
[05:23:11] <__adrian> if you don't know what they are, then you shouldn't trust them
[05:23:32] <berndj> *i* know what they are, my diagnostic tool doesn't
[05:24:05] <Blondie101010> if you serialized them, how can they be invalid??
[05:24:28] <__adrian> what you're saying is that it will always work unless given input that would break it
[05:24:31] <berndj> because i don't serialize everything i ever put into any of the files
[05:24:40] <__adrian> that's the same as "it's broken"
[05:24:51] <Blondie101010> where do you take the serialized data?
[05:25:44] <__adrian> in any case, i'm pointing out that it's a bad idea and potentially unsafe, not arguing about it. just wanted to be sure you're aware.
[05:26:20] <berndj> Blondie101010, i take it from a db4 file that i wrote either serialized or unserialized values to, depending on what database and whether it's metadata or "row data" (to use relational-DB parlance)
[05:26:43] <Blondie101010> so you just throw any kind of junk in your data randomly
[05:26:48] <Blondie101010> that is the problem
[05:26:50] <berndj> yeah thanks __adrian, this isn't a general-purpose tool, just one i want to use for this particular project i'm doing
[05:27:23] <__adrian> also note that serialization is very poorly suited to be a storage format. the specific format, for example, is an implementation detail - it can (and has) changed.
[05:27:38] * __adrian shrugs 
[05:27:40] <__adrian> sure, up to you
[05:27:46] <berndj> Blondie101010, no, not just any kind of junk. us junk of types that can't be inferred from just the database name and key name without replicating the entire rest of the codebase

[17:01:31] <Guest31> Hi. What is the preferred way of interacting with a Postgres DB. PDO or the pg_ functions?
[17:03:38] <AllenJB> I don't think one is particularly preferred over the other. PDO is easier to work with if you've used it for other DBs, but the pg_ library may be required for some specific functionality. (I don't use pgsql so couldn't tell you what, but similar is true of PDO vs mysqli).
[17:03:39] <AllenJB> If you're using any DB related libraries, check what they support.
[17:06:12] <Guest31> Thanks: Another question I have is: What is the best way to do unit tests with a Postgres DB? Two-phase commits? Something like pg_query('PREPARE TRANSACTION "myunittest"); pg_insert(...); pg_query_assoc(...); ...; pg_query('ROLLBACK PREPARED "myunittest"");?
[17:08:24] <AllenJB> In my opinion DB tests shouldn't need to rely on a clean database. You shouldn't be doing rollback dances. An alternative is to query what's in the DB at the beginning of the test and negate that from the result. This can reveal bugs that only occur when there's other data already in the DB.
[17:13:53] <biberu> it's nice if your integration tests *can* run against a clean db though, makes it easier to run them against e.g. temporary containers or in memory dbs
[17:16:28] <Blondie101010> you simply build your test DB like your test cases
[17:16:39] <__adrian> ^
[17:16:52] <__adrian> just to be clear that you're not running tests on a production db  ;)
[17:17:44] <Guest31> Can pg_insert ... etc. deal with transactions at all? They typically do auto-transactions? Do I need a PDO for this after all?
[17:18:38] <Guest31> AllenJB: But I'd somehow need to clean up the tests, right? By keeping track of the added rows and ultimately DELETEing them?
[17:18:46] <Blondie101010> PDO should not give you more functionality
[17:20:37] <__adrian> i don't see any transation-related pg functions, aside from pg_transaction_status(). i'd conclude that you'd start/commit them manually.
[17:21:04] <__adrian> and again, don't run tests on a "real" DB. make your test DB, run tests, then just drop the test DB.
[17:21:37] <biberu> ^
[17:22:16] <biberu> that also makes it much easier to manage any sensitive data that it might contain
[17:22:37] <__adrian> and to not accidentally email all your customers

[17:23:34] <Guest31> __adrian: Why not two-phase commits + rollback? Seems simpler
[17:24:03] <biberu> if you're testing the mailer itself just start an stmp like you would a db, otherwise just inject a mailer that e.g. does nothing or writes to a stream
[17:24:10] *** Joins: luigibu (~luigi@80.30.201.209)
[17:25:34] <Blondie101010> Guest31:  that belongs in your code...  explicit transactions are good when you need them, and annoying when you don't
[17:26:33] <biberu> Guest31: what if your code uses transactions on its own?
[17:27:29] <Guest31> good point
[17:27:48] <biberu> Guest31: are you using containers?
[17:28:01] <Guest31> Guest31: No
[17:30:34] <biberu> Guest31: you can start a db temporarily in a container, that way you can always start from a known (or empty) state, have your tests stage whatever they need, then just discard it after the test run

[17:35:57] <__adrian> Guest31: why would you guess about that?
[17:36:06] <__adrian> (and no, it's not slow.)
[17:36:19] <biberu> well, it does take several seconds
[17:38:04] <__adrian> which would be slow for an application, but not so much for a test suite
[17:38:16] <biberu> SECONDS!
[17:38:28] <__adrian> stop optimizing your tests
[17:38:43] <biberu> :D
[17:40:14] <biberu> __adrian: another fun thing is to start sqlite instances in memory *per test*, then run them in parallel ^^
[17:40:58] <__adrian> sqlite is attractive, but really it's not great for tests if you don't already use it for your app
[17:41:15] <__adrian> otherwise you're likely testing different SQL
[17:41:21] <biberu> yeah, got to be careful that you're testing the right thing

[23:42:08] <relipse> is too much OO a bad thing?
[23:43:59] <biberu> by definition it's too much
[23:52:12] <relipse> looks like money_format() will need to be redone

[23:56:32] <__adrian> what?  no
[23:56:38] <__adrian> don't money_format()
[23:56:54] <relipse> that's what I mean, I need to upgrade code and remove money_format() since it doesn't exist in php 8
[23:56:59] <__adrian> ah
[23:57:01] <__adrian> ok
[23:57:01] <Sammitch> monkey_format()
[23:57:34] <__adrian> https://php.net/numberformatter.formatcurrency  in case you're not aware
[23:59:12] <Sammitch> the real question is if it applies india's weird currency formatting correctly
