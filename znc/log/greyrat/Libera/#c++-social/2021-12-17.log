[20:41:41] <hinst> do you use Debian Unstable too?
[20:41:54] <hinst> Like Mr. OJ
[20:51:01] <Plazma> sex and the city :: It's a show about [three] [hookers] and their [mom].
[20:51:45] <oj> debian unstable is still better than debian stable, and I don't have to do as much manual configurations as with arch
[20:51:54] <oj> it's a win in the end I think
[20:52:24] <oj> been on it for two years and this is literally the first time it breaks
[20:52:36] <Plazma> void > debian testing  > * 
[20:53:05] <Plazma> OpenBSD > crux > void
[20:53:14] <Plazma> fite me
[20:53:30] <oj> I mean, I've been meaning to get into BSD-world, but I haven't had the time
[20:54:06] <oj> and when all the computers at work run Linux, it's just easier to align with that
[20:54:24] <Plazma> yea, that's kinda been how i've been, i love the bsd's, but yes
[20:54:37] <Plazma> all my academic linux packages that are proprietary are very linux
[20:54:42] <Plazma> and openbsd doesn't have linux_compat anymore
[20:55:29] <oj> what makes void linux so good then?
[20:55:34] <oj> never tried it
[20:56:21] <Faux> I run ubuntu 'cos I'm old. /o/
[20:57:36] <oj> imho ubuntu is just debian but maintained by people who don't understand it as well
[20:57:54] <oj> but ubuntu is fine
[20:57:59] <oj> it's like vanilla ice cream
[20:58:40] <Faux> My original argument for running ubuntu, not debian, was that they understood builds and releases, which debian most certainly do not.
[20:59:09] <hinst> Good evening sires
[20:59:54] <oj> Faux: I suppose, but the ubuntu releases are always hopelessly outdated
[21:01:04] <oj> and honestly the only actual sensible release strategy from an end users POV is rolling releases
[21:01:46] <Oxyd> The only sensible release strategy from a user's POV is to not tie the user's software to the OS release.
[21:03:22] <Faux> oj: They're more up to date than debian in any situation. I despise rolling release; you have absolutely no hope of someone else having fixed your problem.
[21:03:47] <oj> Faux: it depends on how good the tests are
[21:04:06] <Faux> How good are void's tests for xlib?
[21:04:16] <oj> Faux: and I absolutely don't have the same experience RE: being up to date
[21:04:28] <Faux> Okay.
[21:04:39] <oj> but that is probably because I'm forced to use the LTS releases at work
[21:04:58] <Faux> Yes, that's a good way to guarantee a *minimum* age of 9 months, by design.
[21:06:34] <oj> I understand why they've done it, I really do
[21:06:59] <Faux> As Oxyd said, run LTS then install your crap on top, that's most of the point.
[21:07:04] <Faux> For busineseseses.
[21:07:07] <oj> when you have many users, you naturally start prioritizing stability
[21:07:14] <Faux> I don't run LTS so I don't have that problem.
[21:07:49] <Faux> We "run" LTS ubuntu at work, but we're docker so very little of the software in it is actually running.
