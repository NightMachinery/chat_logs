[00:00:32] <gilberth> I don't either. But I don't by your argument because #'(setf foo) is fine as is (fdefinition #'(setf foo)) as (SETF FOO) is a legal function name. Why can't I name macros by function names?
[00:02:09] <gilberth> shka: There will still be a war next week. But don't count on me, I was very wrong with my optimism.
[00:04:38] <gilberth> * (fdefinition '(setf foo)) of course. And (DEFINE-COMPILER-MACRO (SETF FOO) ...) is possible too. Macros are the exception here as they are named by symbols not by function names.
[00:05:19] <pl> shka: the only way it's not going to be still going on is if Russia gives up
[00:05:53] <gilberth> Won't happen. Why should they give up?
[00:06:03] <pl> gilberth: thus why it will be probably ongoing

[00:07:23] <shka> eh, why no assholes suddenly die because of aneurism bursting?
[00:07:35] <gilberth> Would that change a thing?
[00:08:08] <shka> yes
[00:08:46] <pl> shka: any wannabe dictator would probably abandon Ukraine invasion

[00:14:04] <shka> also, even Lavrov was caught criticizing Crimea annexation

[03:41:12] <hayley> moon-child: Compiling with Continuations mentions the issue of moving arithmetic operators around w.r.t control flow, with the program `let val j = i*i in if x then j else i end handle Overflow => 0` (i.e. return 0 if i² overflows, else return i). Appel finds this "changes the behaviour of the program" sufficiently to be undesirable.
[03:42:14] <White_Flame> even floating point error propagation is affected by the most meager reordering
[03:42:23] <hayley> Right.
[04:22:20] <gilberth> Well, the problem with C is that the programs don't crash. If they would everything would be fine.
[04:22:45] * hayley nods
[04:23:20] <hayley> And the book does not actually say how to use gdb (other than saying "it's hard", gee thanks), nor points to any other debugging tools like AddressSanitizer.
[04:24:41] <gilberth> Do have to know how to use gdb? It's very rare that I use it. And when I do, I don't do much more than to look at a backtrace.
[04:26:32] <hayley> ...seems GCC supported ASAN in version 4.8 in 2013. The first commit was in 2013 as well. Might have been too new, but he accepts pull requests, and thus some talk of convincing the C compiler to check for bogus memory accesses and such would be good.
[04:26:50] <hayley> I often print global variables and poke at locals in stack frames.
[04:27:26] <gilberth> I just stare at the line causing the segmentation fault and think.
[04:28:08] <hayley> Also remember that the target audience of the book includes people who haven't written Lisp and C. They don't have an intuition for it.
[04:28:49] <hayley> (Obviously if you had written Lisp before, you would run very far away from the book, but it is intended, and sometimes recommended, as an introduction to C.)
[04:29:34] <gilberth> Well, we don't need to discuss it an upteens time. This book also is a bad C book. It doesn't teach you C either.
[04:30:40] <hayley> Sure. But I do believe that e.g. -fsanitize=address deserves some mention. I used it to figure out where I screwed up with the spiffy C++ types in university in 2020.
[04:31:30] <hayley> It's the closest thing I can think of to adding proper bounds checks to C, when C arrays^Wpointers don't give you bounds to check against.
[04:34:10] <hayley> (Or, shall I say "C pointers in common compilers" because you can of course specify that out-of-bounds accesses cause bounds errors. But that is not how GCC nor Clang works.)
[04:42:53] <hayley> Appel in CWC: "Even so, the speed of compilation would then be about 25 lines per second on a twenty-MIPS machine. This is terrible; a good fast C compiler can compile about 400 lines of C per second on a similar machine. There are two consolations, however: with our compiler, you don't have to write your programs in C; and computers are getting faster at a faster rate than programs are getting bigger (we hope)."

[05:42:40] <hayley> Could do, yes.
[05:43:22] * hayley had time to ponder about accusations of "magic" or "wizardry" in CS while cleaning the shower.
[05:44:00] <hayley> Some consider it to be an elitist thing, but, based on the SICP lectures at least, the "computer science is magic" theme of SICP is a self-derogatory one. It's magical because the authors do not believe we know how to compute.
[05:45:28] <hayley> While I was editing the Lisp Curse Redemption Arc, I noted that the article that I "refuted" with a year-old text quoted <http://www.loper-os.org/?p=42> saying "behind every Clojure primitive there lurks Black Magic". The author thought it sounded kewl. Stanislav intended it as an insult, indicating that the language is not self-sufficient enough for his liking.
[05:45:29] -ixelp- Loper OS » Thumbs Down for Clojure
[05:46:11] <hayley> So, contrary to popular belief, I suspect claims of "magic" are not intended as good things.
[05:56:48] <hayley> I think Gnuxie referenced SICP to make the point long ago, but I now get to make the connection with somewhat more recent events.
[05:59:19] <hayley> Also, IIRC the cover of the Dragon book pictures a dragon as "complexity in compiler design" which a knight is to defeat.
[06:03:34] <hayley> But there has been recent outrage (of sorts) that magic themes are meant to depict computer scientists as superior in some way. Quite the opposite: they are, for the most part, set to handle problems they cannot even comprehend.
[06:15:46] <White_Flame> hm, i read that stuff of SICP completely differently
[06:16:07] <White_Flame> as in its autonomy in processing is like conjuring/creating somethign with its own spirit
[06:16:22] <White_Flame> so it's more about it being animated, than it being unknown
[06:17:09] <White_Flame> we are cybermancers ;)
[06:18:11] <hayley> Well, I guess that works too.
[06:21:10] *** Quits: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[06:25:26] <hayley> But I can't see the introductory speech in the first SICP lecture as anything other than an admission by Harold Abelson that he thinks we haven't grasped computer science, like ancient geometry didn't separate practise from theory of geometry, which he says, or like how a serious magician probably doesn't know what they're poking around with. The preface of the first edition of the textbook also claims the significance of "computer science" is
[06:25:26] <hayley> far detached from actual computers, and actual science.
[06:26:49] <White_Flame> that last part is well agreed upon
[06:26:56] <White_Flame> if anythign, it's the modeling & analysis of computation
[06:28:08] <hayley> The first chapter does go into "we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells" and all, as you say, but now I read it as a joke, that we're as clueless as someone casting spells upon a frog.
[06:33:29] <hayley> I'd say it's a shower thought, but I was cleaning the shower, and now I am passing time until the chlorine smell goes away.
[06:36:20] <White_Flame> "you can think of [a process] as like a magical spirit that sort of lives in the computer.  And the thing that directs a process is a pattern of rules called a procedure"
[06:37:04] <White_Flame> to me, his focus is away from the tools (surveying equipment, computing equipment) and to the notions that the tools are using (geometry, computation)
[06:37:36] <White_Flame> and "computation" isn't reified anywhere specific, it is really nothing more than "process"
[06:37:58] <hayley> Sure.
[06:38:31] <White_Flame> at least from rewatching the first part of the lecture, Id on't get a sense of elitism, but rather that it's actually about the formalisms of process than about the computer 
[06:39:01] <White_Flame> every statement ends up with that re-grounding
[06:42:04] <White_Flame> and reading chapter 1 of the book, it's also all very grounded in the directions that control process, poitning out that "process" "cannot be seen or touched. it is not composed of matter at all"
[06:42:21] <White_Flame> but not that they're unknown or uncontrollable
[06:43:14] <White_Flame> it's just not equivalent to the mechanism that controls it

[19:15:26] * gilberth finds the spot in mulisp where the console is polled for an interrupt character, which is a BIOS call made every 032h function application essentially, and wonders how much performance that took.
[19:16:50] <gilberth> Actually I wonder why that that wasn't configurable. The manual is very detailed and some things could be configured by patching the binary.
[19:19:03] <gilberth> Also the routine which invokes the BIOS service is an indirect call by self-modifying code. The one single instance of self-modifying code I found. This is either for speed to for perhaps being able to place a stub there which would disable calling into the BIOS.
[19:21:13] <gilberth> Anyhow this polling by doing the equivalent of (LISTEN *TERMINAL-IO*) is the only way to have sth like an interrupt in CP/M, as there is no signal(2).

[21:15:38] -ixelp- Thread by @RihoTerras on Thread Reader App – Thread Reader App
[21:18:56] <ck_> that the "war expensive, just hodl" thread?
[21:19:18] <White_Flame> yeah, russia making their attack look bigger than it is
[21:19:24] <White_Flame> because they have no resources
[21:19:34] <White_Flame> no clue how true it actually is, but interesting
[21:28:55] <epony> White_Flame, the war started in April 2014 when CIA director John Brannon visited Ukraine to command a military operation of the then president Turchinov with military, paramilitary recrouts and nationalist fascist militarised formations, against local own population in the eastern regions of Ukraine, killing thousands of people between 2014 and 2022 to which the west, including you, turn a blind eye.
[21:30:57] <epony> you really have no idea what you're even commenting.. from paid commercial western media propaganda that is sponsoring and destroying eastern European countries since the early 90ies, trying and succeeding to turn them against their neighbours eastwards towards Russia
[21:32:20] <ck_> I still have my iraqi information minister fortune file somewhere
[21:33:02] <ck_> "We will welcome them with bullets and shoes."
[21:33:09] <epony> you've never been in Ukraine and do not know anything from the history of the country, you just repeat what western media tells you and cheer at the sock puppet governments killing thousands of people and exploiting the situation economically until these countries are destroyed and turned into emmigration labour camps to come to service your elderly and farms in west Europe and ultimately become depopulated and ready for invasion from the Arab empires of evil 
[21:33:09] <epony> again
[21:33:11] <Lycurgus> well russia has a smaller economy than texas
[21:33:28] <epony> Lycurgus, who told you that?
[21:33:39] <Lycurgus> it's the case, ppp aside
[21:33:47] <Lycurgus> texas 2 trillion
[21:33:49] <epony> that's simply wrong and also quite stupid
[21:34:01] <Lycurgus> russia 1.5 or thereabouts
[21:34:36] <Lycurgus> of texas doesn't have ppp or it's not different from nominal
[21:34:43] <Lycurgus> *ofc texas
[21:35:23] <epony> are you using bitcoin to measure that false claim?
[21:36:04] <Lycurgus> googling 'russia' shows 1.4 trillion
[21:36:16] <epony> it does not really matter, does it?
[21:36:39] <epony> you're justifying killing of people by CIA commanding director with a "small economy"
[21:36:47] <Lycurgus> and googling 'texas gdp' shows 2
[21:37:10] <Lycurgus> epony are you defending the invasion of ukraine?
[21:37:21] <epony> did you not get some bitcoin scam halt your major Texan economy for 2 weeks last year?
[21:38:39] <epony> Lycurgus, are you insane, you're supporting murder of thousands of people by the corrupt puppet in the Ukraine that the US CIA installed in 1999 and keeps replacing in 2005 and 2010 and 2014
[21:39:21] * Lycurgus ignores epony
[21:39:36] <epony> by comparing a large former superpower with a cow producing plantation, you think you can justify murder of thousands of civilians by terrorists that you supply with weapons
[21:39:41] <epony> Lycurgus, fuck off
[21:40:25] <epony> Lycurgus: "Russia is a small economy, let's authorise murder of Russians in Eastern Ukraine"  --you're a fascist.

[21:58:54] <epony> that's what the cold war was about, parity of superpowers so the USA can become the major invader and encircle countries that are not under its direct control

[22:39:32] <Lycurgus> really? lispers or just the trolls that show up in lisp channels?
[22:39:59] <mfiano> By the way, epony is one of Andrew Lee's advisors. He came here to troll a lot of channels a couple months ago.
[22:40:02] <clothespin> are we still slamming the usa?
[22:40:03] <Lycurgus> i think I've seen epony as a regular in lisp channels
[22:40:14] <Lycurgus> ah
[22:40:29] <Lycurgus> so i guessed right 
[22:41:00] <White_Flame> Lycurgus: I meant "here" as in IRL, not "here" as in IRC
[22:41:06] <Lycurgus> oh
[22:41:43] <mfiano> I have had him on ignore for more than a month now after I learned who they were and what they were up to, upsetting a lot of channels here. I have no idea what was said.
[22:42:34] <Lycurgus> he was vigorously defending the ukraine invasion when i put him on ignore
[22:43:49] <Lycurgus> trolling could be like a sport igess
[22:44:16] <mfiano> I poked phoe to finally get rid of him. It bothers me when an ignore is not effective because many more than me are bothered.
[22:44:28] <ck_> mfiano: you learned that how?
[22:44:50] <gilberth> Well, most of the time this electrical pony talks to itself.
[22:44:59] <mfiano> I saw it on Twitter a few months ago. It might be google-able.
[22:45:30] <ck_> oh, ok.. can you summarize it in a few words for me please?
[22:46:02] <White_Flame> yeah, epony was on #fsf being all pro-freenode and how libera is evil SJWs and whatnot back when it all happened
[22:46:07] <mfiano> search for "epony" here: http://techrights.org/2021/11/30/reddit-complex-freenode/
[22:46:16] <mfiano> that is one article, not sure if it's the one I saw
[22:46:21] <White_Flame> also was very active on fn:#freenode until the audience there dwindled, then became more active on libera
[22:46:46] <ck_> thanks
[22:47:40] <gilberth> And it seems to be a bit calmer these days, I have not watched ad hominem attacks/insults/flames here recently and in so far I regard this entity as harmless for the most part.
[22:48:23] <Lycurgus> does it seem at least partially automated?
[22:48:49] <Lycurgus> impressive if it were largely so
[22:49:00] <Lycurgus> very impressive if completely
[22:49:01] <gilberth> idk. Curious is that all links posted are to wikipedia.
[22:49:10] <mfiano> Yeah that article is what I heard; that he was one of Andrew Lee's server ops advising him on locking it down etc, and then he got bored when users left and came here to cause wreak more havoc. I also remember him being on the old Freenode causing trouble for years before the whole ordeal last year.
[22:51:57] <White_Flame> yeah, he got banned from all the lisp channels one by one on freenode
[22:52:17] <mfiano> I remember that a couple years ago.
[22:52:42] <White_Flame> as did pjb, he's behaving a lot better nowadays

[23:45:27] <clothespin> yes
[23:46:21] <White_Flame> I want to work on more of what I'm trying to work on, but it's hard work :-/
[23:46:37] <clothespin> yeah
[23:47:00] <gilberth> Well, I have the problem, that I can't finish anything.
[23:47:18] <clothespin> i know that
[23:47:56] <White_Flame> I have a forward chaining system that is constant-to-sublinear in speed, and linear in memory footprint, with regards to the count of facts in the knowledgebase, and I'm working on integrating backchain queries to the rules as well
[23:48:20] <gilberth> And I take breaks now and then and do rather unproductive things, like dissecting ancient mulisp. :-)
[23:48:30] <White_Flame> it's a difficult problem
[23:48:45] <White_Flame> (or at least, a very lofty but probably feasible goal)
[23:51:33] <gilberth> What's in the knowledge base?
[23:56:30] <clothespin> kittens
[23:57:40] <gilberth> No small horses?
[23:59:01] <White_Flame> nor electric ones ;)
[23:59:34] <White_Flame> I've got a few vestigial rule-based projects in these sorts of models, including some analysis for my disassembler/reverse-engineering engine
[23:59:40] <gilberth> Wait a second. When the entities are not inside it, maybe the knowledge is the thing?
