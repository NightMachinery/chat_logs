[00:15:19] <Caspy7[m]> ede: that says activity stream, which is generally to do with New Tab content. So it's likely to do with that.

[00:15:37] <Caspy7[m]> it doesn't load for me so I'm guessing it's dynamic enough, doesn't ship with the browser
[00:16:08] <Caspy7[m]> and if you have new tab ad-like stuff disabled then it probably doesn't matter to you

[00:16:59] <ede> i just created the profile in that thing i really don't want to use anymore words right now.
[00:17:35] <ede> 2 tabs open: this crap with an image of a totally irrelevant person and something about privacy bla bla
[00:18:16] <ede> actually i done it only to have noscript on a new profile of a recent version to do some tests
[00:18:54] <ede> and i just could open AMO and that annoying bubble about updates appears for the SECOND time already
[00:20:04] <pa> Caspy7[m], mefistofeles , so it looks like with a new profile that page is dark :/
[00:20:13] <pa> how do i fix my profile?? :'(
[00:21:04] <pa> could it be some setting of the plugin itself?
[00:21:12] <pa> i mean extension
[00:21:24] <mefistofeles> pa: I'd blame your profile rather than the extension, or some other extension you are using on your profile
[00:21:40] <pa> hm..
[00:21:44] <pa> i can try to disable them
[00:21:47] <mefistofeles> yeah
[00:23:09] <Caspy7[m]> when all else fails, the more troublesome but effective route is to do a "profile refresh" which imports the main data from your current profile including bookmarks, history and open tabs into a fresh profile, leaving behind all previous settings and addons
[00:24:33] <pa> so i removed all of them, and that didn't help. I would do the profile refresh but i have all my containers that are connected to cookie auto delete, and if i sync them from profile, the two will be out of sync
[00:25:52] <pa> in fact i have to use ffox profile dir on external drive, because multi account containers and cookie auto delete do not sync properly through profile :'(

[02:07:37] <ede> incredible
[02:08:13] <ede> closing the new 95 profile with just noscript and a single twitter tab open managed to kill all my irc connections and crash the browser.
[02:12:01] <ede> AND killed my keyboard in htop (or maybe screen). another round of <C-a><Z> <C-d>
[02:13:00] <ede> at least the normal profile is back to 40% RAM, which means firefox COULD release unused RAM, it just doesn't.
[02:20:04] <Caspy7[m]> ede: worth noting that some things are lazy loaded, so they won't load on startup, but if you or a site needs it, it may get loaded up and then not unloaded. So you could start with a blank tab, do a bunch of browsing, end with a blank tab and wait and it would not be expected to go back down to the initial size
[02:21:54] <nemo> ede: huh... I've never had that happen (the character thingy)

[13:22:50] <Mo> And if I would like to delete form data?
[13:23:15] <Cork> simplest is just to press del when you see an entry in a form you don't want there
[13:23:27] <Mo> So FF kind of remembers a textfield "street" of a address form and provides it the next time?
[13:24:03] <Mo> Weird that I can't maintain that data like I can with about:logins
[13:24:46] <Mo> The idea for me, because I'm going to remove all passwords from FF sync, migrating to KeePassXC-Browser Addon, I was thinking if I could also migrate this kind of remembered form data.
[13:25:27] <Cork> well it is per field per site so the simplest place to have that is in said form
[13:26:37] <Mo> Ah, that street field is only per site, it wouldn't offer that on a different site with field 'street'?
[13:27:04] <Cork> if i remember correctly, ya, not completely sure though
[13:27:30] <Mo> Not much information about that old feature. And that places.sqlite is also synced via FF sync?
[13:28:15] <Cork> its a database so it isn't synked as one unit
[13:28:17] <Cork> but yes
[13:28:33] <Mo> Question about Firefox sync. Is actually everything in about:config synced via the sync?

[16:36:57] <Iamthehuman1> Hello. I'm on Ubuntu Studio 22.04 daily build. I was on my way of copying my chrome.css from the old system into the ~/.mozilla/firefox/profilenamegoeshere/chrome/chrome.css when I noticed there is no ~/.mozilla
[16:38:15] <Iamthehuman1> I rely extensively on this https://wrw.is/multiple-tab-rows-in-firefox/ to make my pinned and unpinned tab amounts in my browser windows viable
[16:38:38] <Cork> Iamthehuman1: goto about:support and you'll find where your profile is located
[16:38:53] <Cork> there is even a button to open it in your file explorer
[16:39:02] <Iamthehuman1> yes! thank you Cork
[16:39:25] <Iamthehuman1> I see Ubuntu Studio has installed the Firefox from a snap and not from an apt
[16:39:59] <Cork> ya, canonical loves there snaps...
[16:42:59] <Iamthehuman1> Can I ask a newb question? Is there a safe way to restart FireFox without losing all the tabs. I think this was possible, but I'm a bit worried (and thus on the side of logout-login or just a reboot) because I noticed somewhile back that on Ubuntu Studio 21.10 the default behaviour of asking "Do you really want to close all these tabs?" has disappeared and I think I managed to nuke couple of windows full of important-yish tabs in there when I was 
[16:43:00] <Iamthehuman1> trying to close some other program, that just would not "get it" when I press the small "X" in the corner
[16:44:00] <akik> Iamthehuman1: the setting is there
[16:44:10] <Iamthehuman1> about:settings ?
[16:44:19] <Cork> about:preferences
[16:44:21] <akik> Iamthehuman1: settings/general/startup/open previous windows and tabs
[16:45:31] * mizzunet uploaded an image: (91KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/KJvbBUiBnEcVqRGJYvEtbaoo/image.png >
[16:45:51] <Iamthehuman1> akik: Thank you. "Confirm before closing multiple tabs" indeed is there and was unticked on this US 22.04
[16:45:54] <mizzunet> The first setting is to restore the tab as well
[16:46:44] <Iamthehuman1> So it is safe to ctrl-Q and restart and all tabs will return? I have the "open previous windows and tabs" box ticked
[16:48:53] <akik> Iamthehuman1: that's what it does for me
[16:49:58] <Iamthehuman1> I'll just clean up unnecessary tabs and then just save all the windows as bookmark folders first and then restart it

[16:55:41] <Iamthehuman1> akik: yes it worked like that here as well, thanks
[17:00:29] <Iamthehuman1> hmmhhh... this https://wrw.is/multiple-tab-rows-in-firefox/ isn't being applied in the current version of FireFox if it is placed in ~/snap/firefox/common/.mozilla/firefox/chrome/userChrome.css .. I've been using this hack for years and years. Perhaps it could still work, perhaps I should search for an updated version.
[17:01:24] <Iamthehuman1> sorry that path is missing the profile name placeholder from it, forgot to add it
[17:02:17] <akik> Iamthehuman1: firefox is a snap in ubuntu 22.04 ?
[17:02:26] <Iamthehuman1> oh sorry, I recall there is something that needs setting to "true" before it will start working .. 
[17:02:37] <Iamthehuman1> akik: On Ubuntu Studio 22.04, yes
[17:05:06] <Iamthehuman1> yeah, now the userChrome.css kicked in, sorry for the channel noise, my bad, not reading the instructions
[17:09:59] <Iamthehuman1> Seems I have 2x firefoxen .... one from snap and one from apt, this could be due to that I used Aptik to restore all apts and snaps I had installed in the previous system.
[17:11:41] <Iamthehuman1> Aptik is a for-a-fee software to back up and restore various things on Linuxen by TeeJee who wrote and writes Timeshift. Can be used to clone whole system to be restored on a cleanly installed Linux. Using it to do less than full restore requires the user to know what to restore and what to not
