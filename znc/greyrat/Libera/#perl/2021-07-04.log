[00:17:15] <Harzilein> is there a dumper on top of json that is sufficient to then reproduce the same output format Data::Dumper would produce?
[00:17:47] <ether> leitz: not sure what youmena, but you should end up with a lib/Book/Collate.pm with "package Book::Collate;"
[00:17:52] <Harzilein> (in before: no, putting the Data::Dumper format in a json string would only technically be sufficient)
[00:18:22] <curdlesnoot> well, no. Data::Dumper doesn't produce JSON to begin with.

[00:19:06] <Harzilein> curdlesnoot: i asked for a json format that could roundtrip to the same format Data::Dumper produces (but may be more helpful for json consumers)

[00:25:35] <leitz> ether, I'm learning the "build a module for CPAN" thing, so it's likely I don't understand. The repo is book_collate, and the modules will be Book::Collate::Book, Book::Collate::Report, etc. There isn't any Book::Collate yet, that I can find. Not sure if I need to work on that as well, or what.
[00:26:38] <Harzilein> evaluating JSON::Dumper::Compact for my purposes now
[00:27:51] <ether> if you're planning on uploading a distribution named Book-Collate, you should have a module in there named Book::Collate

[00:33:15] <Grinnz> leitz: there is no implicit hierarchy in perl packages. all modules under Book::Collate:: must be in lib/Book/Collate/ and have package Book::Collate::*
[00:35:34] <leitz> Grinnz, thanks. The current plan is to populate the modules that do stuff, and then build an app that uses them. Hopefully not too laughable.
[00:36:59] <Grinnz> you also must have a module Book::Collate matching the distribution named Book-Collate, as ether mentioned
[00:37:12] <Harzilein> sorry, i shouldn't have started this request so early and then not have the patience to explain it properly
[00:38:01] <leitz> Grinnz, I'll see how far I can get on the code today, and likely Monday. Then will run it by you all for helpful critique and snarky comments.   :)
[00:38:06] <Grinnz> Harzilein: JSON is a string not a structure; print Dumper decode_json $json?
[00:38:18] <leitz> After that, likely a good bit of refactoring to meet your recommendations.
[00:38:25] <Grinnz> although reading your next comment i have no idea what you're asking for :D
[00:39:15] <Grinnz> Data::Dumper is a serialization format; JSON is a serialization format
[00:39:18] <Grinnz> nothing can be both
[00:40:26] <Harzilein> Grinnz: i'm more about finding something less "fsck you json consumer" than (hypothetically) doing encode_json($dd->Dump($var))
[00:40:38] <Harzilein> that _would_ allow for roundtripping for sure
[00:40:44] <Harzilein> but only technically
[00:40:53] <Grinnz> um... just encode $var to json?
[00:41:25] <Grinnz> why do you need the Dumper format?
[00:41:43] <Harzilein> i want to preserve what's in the dumper format.
[00:41:53] <Grinnz> well, that format is a string, so there is literally no other option
[00:42:31] <Harzilein> but it already contains all the conventions i'd need my own TO_JSON for otherwise
[00:42:50] <Grinnz> i mean: if you want the Data::Dumper output, there is no other option than to encode that output into your json
[00:43:28] <Grinnz> but secondarily, relying on Data::Dumper output for serialization is ugly
[00:43:50] <Grinnz> i'd recommend leveraging json instead if possible
[00:44:04] <Grinnz> json can be decoded without the risk of code injection, for one thing
[00:45:06] <Grinnz> (but if you're not planning on decoding it, then whatever)
[00:45:23] <Harzilein> but you understand what i mean? i'd actually be fine with starting out w/ just the string and have that further refined than initially missing everything (apart from readily serializable things)
[00:45:30] <leitz> Grinnz, like this?     https://gist.github.com/LeamHall/92ce147fd3bf870a4ee668bb51d3b4b7

[00:46:37] <Grinnz> also the manifest test

[00:48:40] <Grinnz> thats fine
[00:48:47] <leitz> So, xt is for document tests?
[00:49:00] <Grinnz> no, just tests that should never be run by the user in general
[00:49:22] <Grinnz> normally you use xt/author/ for author tests and xt/release/ for release tests
[00:49:29] <leitz> Ah, gotcha. I set AUTHOR and RELEASE to get as much testing as possible.
[00:49:32] <Grinnz> but that is more useful with an authoring tool that understands this like dzil
[00:50:06] <leitz> I'll get to dzil eventually, but it helps my brain "get it" when I start at the bottom and work my way up.
[00:50:36] <Grinnz> i suppose it will help you know about all the horrible things you never have to do again when you use a real authoring tool

[01:45:40] <LeoNerd> I don't think I did anything special. It just works

[01:46:23] <Grinnz> right, that's reinventing what local::lib does to install those in separate places
[01:46:57] <LeoNerd> I'm not following "what it does". I did one thing - I just set PERL_MB_OPT=--install_base=$HOME
[01:47:09] <LeoNerd> That's one line of .bashrc

[01:48:04] <Grinnz> no, but it's installed to the same place with that method
[01:50:52] <Grinnz> anyway, the point was more about what cpanm does, not what you can configure in your env when knowing how EUMM and MB work
[01:51:28] <LeoNerd> I guess it's more I didn't see why cpanm would have that restriction
[01:51:47] <Grinnz> it doesn't, it just doesn't provide any switches to that effect
[01:51:53] <LeoNerd> Ah

[06:22:33] <Grinnz> oh actually submatches uses the number variables too, it's just useful when you want a list of all of them
[06:23:21] <v`> this is just what happens when it's legal to buy fireworks and there's the roadside stands all week selling fireworks... but it's still illegal to set off the fireworks in residential districts...
[06:23:45] <v`> what u get is people not giving a f**k and setting off explosions in residential districts...

[06:27:42] <gry> calling it 'drama' implies it succeeded at getting attention.. not really

[06:29:31] <gry> v`: it was unwittingly and sneakily purchased by someone who decided to just come in and do things, including destroying all existing infrastructure, without permissions or consensus
[06:29:58] <v`> oh yep i do have the backstory :)
[06:30:04] <gry> thats good
[06:30:16] <Grinnz> hasnt been worth caring about what's going on over there for a week or two now

[06:35:57] <simcop2387> also they have an irc server on s390x lol

[06:39:35] <v`> wasn't IRC born in 1988?
[06:39:41] <Grinnz> yeah, he's a bit off
[06:39:46] <v`> that would make it 32 years, not 22
[06:39:51] <simcop2387> yea he's been seemingly trying to conflate freenode as the only irc
[06:40:17] <simcop2387> freenode started 1 score and 2 years ago (or so)
[06:40:22] <v`> "However, we're proud to announce that we've completely obliterated the swamp removing the shackles on progress,"

[06:40:44] <simcop2387> v`: the people who told him, "what? no."
[06:41:14] <Grinnz> "the swamp" == everyone actually capable of running an irc network
[06:44:43] <v`> "The freenode digital autonomous zone is proud to announce IRC.com by freenode."
[06:45:25] <v`> am i reading that right, do they own the irc.com domain? how did they get it?
[06:46:47] <Grinnz> andrew lee has owned that for years, he just now repurposed it for freenode
[06:48:10] <simcop2387> i'm still betting on him claiming that they're the only ones allowed to use the term IRCÂ®
[06:49:54] <v`> The power of the people cannot be stopped. freenode is here to stay, no matter what gets thrown at it. It's now, as well, a recognized digital autonomous zone which gives it the unique ability to provide what freenode does best: freedom.
[06:49:54] <v`> freenode is IRC. freenode is FOSS. freenode is freedom. Ask not what you can do for freenode, but what freenode will do for you. IRC is back!
[06:50:04] <v`> i honestly dont know how to parse any of that
[06:50:12] <simcop2387> haven't seen a trademark filing yet for it but i'm not going to hold my breath on it not happening
[06:51:33] <v`> "freenode is freedom"
[06:51:50] <v`> what can u do on freenode that u can't do lots of other places?
[06:51:54] <simcop2387> but if you mention any other networks you get banned
[06:52:20] <simcop2387> talk about how the wrong kind of people, *touches nose*, were running the network before.

[07:03:01] <simcop2387> rasengan's interviews and blog posts, that's almost certainly what he's trying to do.  he's got some kind of bipolar fixation with a nostalgic idea of irc from the 90s that he thinks he can not only recreate but sell the rest of the world on.  i believe he claimed he'd have millions of users and channels on there "soon"

[19:00:07] <LeoNerd> Personally I don't really see it makes much difference
[19:00:12] <LeoNerd> But people seem to want it
[19:00:29] <pragma-> It's nice to not have external dependencies and it's nice to know that it's "official" and "the way to do it".
[19:00:43] <LeoNerd> It's like... whatever code you're writing is probably going to pull a tonne of CPAN dependencies -anyway-, right?
[19:00:43] <pragma-> Tim Toady is starting to show his age.
[19:00:45] <LeoNerd> What's one more?
[19:01:19] <LeoNerd> If your entire program has no non-core dependencies then either it's a tiny trivial ~50line script, or you are reÃ¯nventing a _lot_ of things you should be using from CPAN modules

[19:06:25] <pragma-> I mean, when there's 20 competing Try/Catch modules in CPAN that all have slightly different semantics and implementations (ew, source filters) one starts to worry about the quality of the CPAN modules and one wonders which modules they ought to be using. If there's one in core, then a lot of worries are alleviated.
[19:07:22] <LeoNerd> Sure, I agree that a good implementation is better than a bad one
[19:07:28] <LeoNerd> Why does that -have- to be in core though?
[19:07:30] <ehuelsmann[m]> pragma-: right, but you will likely end up with all of them in your dependency tree, when you use enough of CPAN.
[19:07:38] <pragma-> And a core implementation is considered "official" and "the best of the best"
[19:07:42] <LeoNerd> Hah!
[19:07:47] <pragma-> Uh oh.
[19:07:55] <LeoNerd> Because anything in core is _of course_ better than the CPAN alternatives, right? ;)
[19:08:01] <pragma-> They should be!
[19:08:08] <LeoNerd> I find that's rarely the case
[19:08:11] <pragma-> Oh no.
[19:08:12] <LeoNerd> CPAN can move a hundred times faster
[19:08:26] <LeoNerd> Compare Syntax::Keyword::Try with use feature 'try'
[19:08:34] <LeoNerd> See how many more features SKT has that 'try' currently does not
[19:08:42] <LeoNerd> This is because it's just faster/easier to iterate on CPAN
[19:08:58] <pragma-> I always prioritized core modules over CPAN modules!
[19:09:02] * pragma- bangs head against desk again.
[19:09:31] <LeoNerd> E.g. if you want typed   catch($e isa Some::Exception::Type)  you need to use the CPAN module. Core doesn't support that yet.
[19:09:40] <LeoNerd> If you want try/catch/finally, agan CPAN
[19:09:43] <ehuelsmann[m]> LeoNerd: talking of SKT: I found it was broken for "=~" matches; I filed a bug for it on rt.cpan. However, I had to rewrite anyway in order to use 'try' directly on Perl 5.34.
[19:10:14] <LeoNerd> ehuelsmann[m]: Oh.. huh I don't recall seeing a bug
[19:10:34] <LeoNerd> pragma-: Anyway, even if you aren't a huge fan I -strongly- urge you to have a play with Object::Pad. Now is the time to adjust and fine-tune the design of it
[19:10:45] <LeoNerd> If you wait until a couple of years later when it becomes core, that will be too late to adjust it
[19:11:00] <LeoNerd> Play with it _now_ so we can work on the design... it's honestly a hundred times faster to do that on CPAN

[19:11:27] <ehuelsmann[m]> I think the one before or after is the same probelm.
[19:11:32] <ehuelsmann[m]> problem.
[19:11:51] <pragma-> LeoNerd: I'll keep Object::Pad in mind
[19:12:17] <ehuelsmann[m]> I'm not switching to Object::Pad yet, but I find it a very interesting development.
[19:12:51] <LeoNerd> ehuelsmann[m]: Try updating XS::Parse::Keyword then force-rebuild SKT and retest
[19:13:00] <LeoNerd> It's possible that's a holdover from some odd XPK bug
[19:13:19] <ehuelsmann[m]> ok. I'll check that out, thanks.
[19:13:23] <pragma-> I've yet to actually use Moo/Moose/Object::Pad/Dios/etc personally yet. I've minorly hacked on some projects that used those, but I've yet to write my own project using them. I'll prioritize Object::Pad for when/if I start such a project.
