[03:05:44] <Joanna> That seems foolish to use an elevator for security isn’t it better to not let the wrong people into the building to begin with ?
[03:07:21] <NiLon> what if there are places you want people to access still?
[03:07:55] <NiLon> say a hospital, you want people to visit doctors but maybe not let them run in surgery
[03:08:06] *** Joins: `Tim (~zenguin@user/zenguin)
[03:08:08] <piou> You may not have control over the entire building, you may want something more fine-grained than "employee or not" by having each employee allowed only to the floor they work on, you way find difficult to secure the elevator because it gives into the underground parking lot, access of which is a lot more difficult to properly manage
[03:08:45] <piou> Besides, not letting the wrong people in is really really hard
[03:09:02] <Joanna> I try to avoid elevators as much as possible.
[03:09:02] <piou> Or rather, going into most companies is child's play
[03:09:03] <jjido> In my office (old memories...) there is a barrier at reception, you can go to the canteen and the reception room after you pass it. Then you need a badge for the actual offices

[03:11:53] <Joanna> What I always wonder about pen tests is how easy it is for a stranger to just barge into places they shouldn’t be because the employees working there don’t know eachother. How hard would it be for an employer to introduce employees to eachother so this wouldn’t be so easy to pull off?
[03:12:25] <NiLon> if it's company of 10 people, sure
[03:12:30] <jjido> Joanna +++
[03:12:40] <NiLon> 300 and there is no way you would remember the people or being aware who comes and leaves
[03:12:56] <piou> Joanna: can answer from experience: it's pretty much always extremely easy to enter, and people knowing each others would help but not nearly solve the issue
[03:12:57] *** Joins: dude12312414 (~test@gateway/tor-sasl/dude12312414)
[03:12:57] <NiLon> or if there is some legit contractor for 2 weeks
[03:14:42] <piou> I rarely pass myself as a company employee when I'm social engineering into a company. People may assume I am if they don't ask, but I don't pass myself as one. Passing yourself as an financial auditor in a bank and seing the person blemish in front of you can be pretty funny though.
[03:15:27] <piou> But there are lots of "probably normal" strangers, construction workers, clients, trainee, etc
[03:15:42] <Joanna> It’s a balance between security and getting things done. I think 300 people is not too big a number for personal recognition. At least introduce employees in different departments that might need to  interact.
[03:16:32] <NiLon> you think you can do it but you have no chance, zero
[03:16:41] <NiLon> waste of time honestly
[03:16:42] <piou> must agree with NiLon here
[03:17:05] <piou> and even if you succeed, it's just not *that* helpful. It's helpful. But not worth the time.
[03:17:21] <Joanna> Maybe using non employees to do things is a risk to security
[03:17:24] <spb> far more effective to train people to display company ID and challenge those without it
[03:17:28] <NiLon> and it's not just about one person being able to do it, but *everyone* needs to be on the same page
[03:18:02] <NiLon> you can't even relay a message to wash your coffee cup to 3 people
[03:18:44] <Joanna> Don’t companies have social functions like parties anymore where they can meet other employees?
[03:19:01] <NiLon> maybe, yet not everyone wants to go nor gets there
[03:19:10] <NiLon> also think of party for 300 people, that is *huge*
[03:19:16] <NiLon> no way everyone would go there
[03:19:36] <piou> Joanna: it probably is. But you need a balance between security and getting things done as you said, and no company can be competent at everything from cleaning to repairing to managing all the specifics of everything. Not even accounting for the fact that some things will require external participants no matter what (ex: audits required for certifications)
[03:19:58] <Joanna> I still think that as long as it’s routine to let in strangers there is no chance of good security
[03:20:03] <piou> Joanna: building drunk memories of tens of people at once isn't a reliable way to train people :p
[03:20:06] <NiLon> and personally I prefer to deal with as little with people as possible
[03:20:57] <NiLon> "good security" is kind of nonsense to start with, it's about is it sufficient
[03:21:04] <piou> Joanna: of course, but the question isn't whether to have that routine or not, the question is how do you avoid it? Controlling people isn't easy and is generally quite costly
[03:21:35] <piou> If your security measure costs more than it's protecting, it's the problem not the solution
[03:21:39] <Joanna> I think a lot of businesses care more about profit than security
[03:21:51] <piou> that's what businesses are for
[03:22:05] <piou> That's litteraly what a business is
[03:22:13] <Joanna> Yep
[03:22:40] <piou> Now we can disagree on whether we want most things to be run by businesses, but saying "a business shouldn't care about profit" would be ridiculous
[03:22:41] <NiLon> it would be bad company if it doesn't care about profit
[03:23:01] <jjido> they'll think again if they are forced (by law) to keep security tight
[03:23:10] <piou> Heck, the directors could even be legally liable for mismanagement and fined

[03:23:43] <Joanna> If you don’t have good security your secrets will be stolen and someone else will profit
[03:24:13] <piou> Joanna: sorry, but that sentence lacks so much important nuance that it's laughable

[03:25:44] <NiLon> and even if you have the absolute security with laser drones, you are never really "safe" from being stolen from
[03:25:51] <Joanna> I once read a book about social engineering and someone had a social engineer show up and wine and dine his employees while he was away on vacation and when he got back the employees had unknowingly handed over the blueprints to a competitor .
[03:26:03] <NiLon> you make a product, ship it. Someone will reverse engineer it and make same in china for half the price
[03:26:08] <NiLon> nothing you can do about it
[03:26:26] <piou> In a business, security is there to protect the ability of the company to make money. If it costs more than it should, then it shouldn't. It's not there to protect against everything, it shouldn't impede so much on the company process that it costs more than it protects, and if something is stolen that doesn't cost more to the company that what it would have taken to protect it then it's
[03:26:27] <Joanna> The competitor got it to market first
[03:26:32] <piou> perfectly alright. That's what risk management is about.
[03:27:38] <piou> Joanna: of course you'll find such examples, because they're part of the reality, nobody's claiming the contrary. But security is about managing risks, and that's a risk that must be considered, weighed, and mitigated appropriately.
[03:27:43] <NiLon> Joanna so that is good example of where everything you talked about was defeated yet it wasn't broken
[03:28:10] <NiLon> there is practically no security that protects against rogue worker who has access
[03:28:39] <Joanna> The employees weren’t rogues they were gullible
[03:28:55] <piou> which makes it an even better example
[03:29:03] <NiLon> you would need to fully isolate networking, make them strip naked and do anal probing and even then they could just memorize stuff
[03:30:34] <NiLon> and the reason why they are doing it doesn't matter either, they could be alien brainwashed, doing it for money, being scammed, blacmailed or whatever

[03:32:05] <NiLon> the point is, if you are asking about good security, you are asking the wrong question
[03:32:25] <NiLon> the real question is, if it's sufficient security for the thing you are doing
[03:32:33] <piou> One of my favorite party game is to tell an anecdote such as "Oh, in my company security is shit, anyone can enter, when we forget our badges we just go arround the building through the cafeteria and once inside nobody cares that you don't have a badge" (invented ofc). Upon hearing such anecdotes people always try to one-up by sharing anecdotes from their companies, and it's amazing the kind of
[03:32:39] <piou> valuable insider information you can get from such a simple sentence.

[03:34:21] <NiLon> when I worked in a hospital my only way of knowing if people should be allowed to access or not was: do they have shoes
[03:34:22] <Joanna> I don’t have a high opinion of photo ID in general I prefer personal recognition
[03:34:25] <NiLon> it was bit funny
[03:34:55] <piou> I don't have a high opinion of humans in general, I prefer systems that don't require them.
[03:35:24] <NiLon> but it was fairly simple too, as there were people with dementia and they were quite clever at escaping. They could even get clothes that matched normal people but shoes were one thing they didn't have
[03:35:55] <piou> Having automated portals at every entry that require a personal badge, don't let you use the same badge twice in the same direction and allow only one person through at the time is really effective.

There is no way you do any personal recognition. And what would you do? Say sorry doc, can't let you in even tho you are going to save some people

[03:46:57] <NiLon> exactly
[03:47:00] <Joanna> If it’s not going to happen it’s because someone doesn’t want it to happen.
[03:47:11] <piou> Joanna: it's not about not wanting to
[03:47:44] <Joanna> What did people do before photo id and badges do you think ?
[03:47:50] <piou> I've been plenty of times, just walking arround, even going under desks to take computers in small departments where everybody knew everybody
[03:48:15] <NiLon> they did photo id and badges
[03:48:28] <piou> and before that, whatever they did they changed because what they did wasn't working
[03:49:12] <Joanna> The people might have known eachother but apparently they had not been told to confront strangers
[03:49:49] <Joanna> So that’s a deficiency of whomever their boss was
[03:50:39] *** Quits: martums (~martums@user/martums) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[03:50:44] <NiLon> and what if they have all the badges and papers on them
[03:50:47] <piou> Joanna: One time, small company, maybe 50 person at most. I just come in, say hello, go inside, go to the server room, take photos, go back to the open space, take a computer, open it, close it, go back to the reception, put it on her desk, say goodbye and left. The reception girl thought I was maintenance for their AC which was having issues, the employees inside thought I was some IT guy,
[03:50:54] <piou> everybody identified me as a stranger but they all came with their own rationalisation for why I was there.
[03:51:28] <piou> I've been confronted quite a few times, but people aren't good at it so it's easy to bypass that. It's not their job.
[03:51:44] *** Joins: martums (~martums@user/martums)
[03:51:51] <piou> I wouldn't recommend teaching people to confront intruders, that's security's job. What people should be trained for is calling security on intruders.
[03:52:19] <piou> But a company of even moderate size generally has too many "normal strangers" to consider an unknown person an intruder.
[03:52:38] <Joanna> Another good reason not to use ac :) the employees certainly had not been well trained in security or at all for that matter.
[03:52:44] <NiLon> also it might not matter if some random guy is in the office, but he clearly should not have access to server room or so
[03:53:09] <NiLon> so if you get inside one, that's maybe the problem
[03:54:10] <NiLon> people are inherently faulty when it comes to security, there is no system that works, no matter what you do, it all fails
[03:54:27] <piou> Joanna: they hadn't been well trained, but training people well is exceedingly hard! And costly! And you must do it again and again but not too much because you might desensitize them. It's really hard! An automated machine would have stopped me at the reception. I would probably have been able to wiggle my way in, but it would have stopped me more reliably than any of these employees.

[03:55:06] <Joanna> The problem seems to be a more systematic one. Having strangers wandering around inside your company so much that it becomes normal is not good security at all.
[03:55:21] <piou> *sigh*
[03:55:51] <piou> Joanna: I'll be honnest, you sound like a student in a security cursus that has lots of good principles and great ideas but has never set foot in an actual company
[03:56:05] <piou> That may not be the case, but that's really what this sounds like

[04:00:49] <NiLon> one time I had a car in a gunpoint and there was a captain trying to explain that he needs to access

[04:02:38] <Joanna> If he isn’t on the access list he can’t come in

[04:51:27] <NiLon> there are barracks, but I'm not sure how that is related
[04:53:18] <Hash> Looking for a Hogo static site generator theme for a blog
[04:53:23] <Joanna> You said you can’t recognize people which I find sort of hard to believe if you are all sharing a room.
[04:53:43] <NiLon> there is no way a company "shares a room"
[04:53:57] <NiLon> it's likely that not even a platoon shares a room
[04:54:43] <NiLon> and that is just the barracks, not the place where most operations happen
[04:56:12] <Joanna> Of course not but you work and eat together and have formations so how can you be strangers?
[04:57:22] <NiLon> because that's not how it works?
[04:58:53] <NiLon> a company can be seperated quite a lot, you might not ever meet half of the people
[04:59:11] <NiLon> and that is just to assume that you have weeks to make friends like in some hotel
[04:59:16] <Joanna> Sounds like a strange idea to go off to war and not even know who the people in your company are :)
[04:59:23] <NiLon> also no one would make friends with hundreds of people
[04:59:48] <Joanna> I’m talking about a military company not a civilian one
[04:59:49] <NiLon> that's kind of the point that you don't need to know

[05:09:49] <NiLon> and that access level could change in snap of fingers
[05:10:29] <Joanna> Seems like a no win situation doesn’t it :)
[05:10:44] <NiLon> what you mean?
[05:11:26] <NiLon> just because it doesn't work like you think it does, doesn't mean it doesn't work
[05:11:36] <Joanna> How hard would it be to tell employees if they are to have some stranger visiting in advance though?
[05:12:10] <NiLon> it could be very hard
[05:12:27] <NiLon> and why would everyone even need to know things beyond them
[05:13:25] <TimMc> At my office there are a couple hundred people, and many of them work on teams I interact with very little, which means I will *never* learn all the faces.
[05:13:32] <TimMc> That's just how it goes.
[05:13:35] <Joanna> People not knowing the people around them is a point of weakness both for communities and workplaces
[05:13:39] <NiLon> if the business is large enough there could be 50 "strangers" coming and going a day
[05:14:04] <NiLon> do you just explain every worker about the meetings CEO will have
[05:14:11] <NiLon> don't be ridiculous
[05:14:57] <Joanna> The 50 visitors should not be allowed to have access to everywhere right?
[05:15:12] <NiLon> who knows, depends
[05:15:40] <NiLon> maybe it's a public swimming pool
[05:15:46] <NiLon> go anywhere you like
[05:17:37] <NiLon> and it's neither a plausible system nor working one to know everyone
[05:19:52] <NiLon> not to mention that it would be torture
[05:19:58] <NiLon> quite sure it is illegal
[05:20:01] <Joanna> I seems like there is no importance placed upon people knowing eachother in fact in many cases they are discouraged from knowing eachother and isolated.
[05:20:48] <NiLon> because there is no benefit to it
[05:21:10] <Joanna> You obviously can’t know everyone but you can certainly recognize who is familiar
[05:21:17] <NiLon> well enough benefit to compensate for negatives
[05:21:41] <Joanna> There should not be negatives
[05:22:02] <NiLon> there is, the time for once
[05:22:49] <NiLon> and not everyone wants to know other people nor work with them
[05:23:26] <NiLon> so if those people are forced to do job of security, then you just waste their time and make them feel miserable

[11:58:43] <extor> I just wiped and flashed an ancient Nexus 6P off ebay and it actually connected to google to download a 44.7 MB security update followed by a 43.5MB security update. This was after flashing the very last 8.10 factory image. I wonder if there's a way to figure out what these updates are and if some are proprietary blobs like drivers or radio stuff I guess they could be pulled off the phone to use in an aosp rom compilation?
