[05:18:23] <ijr> Hello, I am looking for a distro I discovered a while ago, it was a testbed distro for exterimentation and testing, designed to be dual-booted with an existing distro
[05:18:36] <wr> have a text file and want to repeat a word inside it, X times, how can i do this on the terminal?
[05:19:12] <wr> ijr, every distro can be dual booted
[05:19:17] <ijr> one word per line, or all one line
[05:19:45] <wr> al
[05:19:47] <wr> all
[05:19:52] <ijr> wr, I understand that, however this distro was designed in a minimalist fashion and made for experimentation
[05:20:33] <wr> ijr, you have to elaborate more there are several distros can do that, testbed for?
[05:21:50] *** redquasar_ is now known as redquasar
[05:21:52] <ijr> It was a general testbed, made in a minimalist fashion, designed to be installed onto a disk (not live booted). It had some explanation on the website stating it was for testing without messing up your main linux installation
[05:22:05] <Henry151> wr: what do you mean "repeat a word inside it"? like the file currently has one word, say "example" and you want the file to read "exampleexampleexample" if X is 3? or what, you want it just echoed to the terminal?
[05:22:16] <wr> ijr, have an idea of ISO size?, tiny linux?
[05:22:42] <wr> Henry151, like repeat "word", X times on the file
[05:23:06] <wr> Henry151, nevermind i already solved it
[05:23:13] <Henry151> :)
[05:23:25] <ijr> it wasn't designed specifically for iso size, and I don't think it  came with a wm
[05:25:04] <ijr> The project that I am intending to use it for is essentally bootstrapping gcc from source
[05:26:44] <ijr> I think that, sadly, I may not find it; I will try LFS for my project. Thank you all for the help

[06:20:37] <mattf> well we got 5 times more resources in the last 15 years and the software became 5 times more bloated and heavy... for example electron
[06:20:42] <superboot> sysRPL: I don't use Excle. Given the hardware you are comparing, I would say that unless they've added the ability to have it use more than one core (unlike libre-office which just uses one), then the hardware wouldn't help too much, as most of the increases in CPU advancement has been in going from single (or two in Core Duo case), to multi (12+) cores.
[06:20:43] <mattf> electron apps
[06:21:14] <mattf> it became easier to code with python, electron, and this heavy crap
[06:21:21] <jim> sysRPL, alternative to excel is gnumeric
[06:21:22] <mlu> I'd say the thing with electron is if you imagine bundling a statically-compiled KDE or Gnome with your app no matter how simple it is
[06:21:40] <superboot> jim: And libreoffice, no?
[06:21:42] <mlu> many people may be surprised by its 100MB overhead
[06:21:49] <jim> dunno
[06:21:50] <jim> :)
[06:21:54] <mlu> libreoffice is bloated, yes, but it's justifiably complex at least
[06:22:10] <mattf> at least you can open the microsoft docs on libreoffice
[06:22:22] <mattf> because you will find yourself working with people who will send those files maybe

[06:52:54] <Sauvin> pnbeast, I won't take that bet.
[06:53:39] <phogg> seanicus: it has to do with how expansions are processed in the shell
[06:53:45] <pnbeast> Either way, the only conversation so far was an unanswered exclamation from triceratux.
[06:53:46] <seanicus> pnbeast: so by "under" you mean...all subsequent commands run in the session?
[06:54:02] <phogg> seanicus: $NICK expands *before* echo is run, so the echo environment has the NICK variable (but the argument was empty)
[06:54:07] <pnbeast> Yeah, roughly, seanicus.
[06:54:28] <seanicus> Okay, why do I so often see command lines constructed in this way, then?
[06:54:43] <seanicus> What's the use of it if the setting of env's isnt relevant to that command line?
[06:54:48] <JohnDoe2> phogg sorry, my assumption was that if mysql can read that, so would any other software :)
[06:54:50] <pnbeast> seanicus, because it's minimal and adequate for the intended purpose?
[06:55:04] <rascul> seanicus try:   NICK="seanicus" env | grep NICK
[06:55:15] <phogg> seanicus: because the program reads its environment to retrieve the value (and the caller doesn't need the variable to persist)

[06:55:49] <seanicus> phogg: ???  but the program doesn't read the environment just set!
[06:55:53] <phogg> JohnDoe2: but there is nothing unsafe about your shell quoting. The mysql warning you see is correct.
[06:55:55] <seanicus> because it isnt set yet
[06:56:08] <phogg> seanicus: it can read the environment, but you didn't ask it to
[06:56:26] <phogg> seanicus: echo doesn't read the NICK variable from the environment at all, instead it looks at argv[1] (which is empty)
[06:56:44] <JohnDoe2> phogg mysql can take the password as is, it's only correct to tell me wrong password because that password never makes it in the uapi command above it
[06:56:45] <rascul> seanicus when you run 'NICK="seanicus" echo $NICK' the shell expansion makes it 'NICK="seanicus" echo ""' because $NICK is expanded before echo is run
[06:56:59] <phogg> seanicus: 'NICK=foo echo $NICK' first expands to NICK=foo echo '' and then echo is run, and echo does not know you wanted to do anything with a NICK environment variable
[06:57:06] <rascul> echo doesn't understand shell variables, that is done by the shell before calling echo
[06:57:07] * [[R]] expands rascul 
[06:57:21] * rascul puts [[R]] into a barrel
[06:57:44] <seanicus> Okay, so if instead of echo I wrote my own program, say in python, and in python I accessed the shells environemtal variables...it WOULD see $NICK?
[06:57:48] <phogg> JohnDoe2: the password you are passing is being passed as a literal, and the literal doesn't contain shell-special characters. Therefore mysql sees it entirely.
[06:57:53] <rascul> seanicus yes

[06:58:28] <[[R]]> seanicus: well you could just write a bash script too
[06:58:29] <rascul> which you can see with:   NICK="seanicus" env
[06:58:35] <pnbeast> seanicus, basically, the syntax you used for your command is a misunderstanding of how bash (and most any shells) work.  You probably wanted to run two commands, but you ran one, strange command.  Try separating them, maybe:  NICK="separate"; echo $NICK
[06:58:36] <JohnDoe2> phogg Okay, but as part of a "quoted string" it needs to be escaped, that's what I need to understand, correct?
[06:58:48] <onelegend> is the operating system responsible for controlling the fan speed?
[06:58:54] <phogg> JohnDoe2: probably not, no
[06:58:59] <onelegend> or does the fan have an internal chip that regulates that
[06:59:07] <[[R]]> onelegend: depends on the fan
[06:59:20] <seanicus> wait, one last question.  When I do `NICK="seanicus" echo $NICK` once, it wont work, I got that.  It isnt set.  But when I run the command the SECOND time, it still doesnt work.  Shouldnt it be set at that point?
[06:59:26] <rascul> onelegend in some cases there is a mechanism that allows fan speed to be controlled in software, depends on both the fan and the motherboard (or whatever the fan is plugged into)
[06:59:28] <phogg> JohnDoe2: if you have a password literal inside a quoted string you may need to escape some characters, but if you already stored it properly in a variable such that it echo's out OK then no further escaping is needed at the shell level.
[06:59:53] <phogg> seanicus: no
[07:00:15] <phogg> seanicus: when you prefix a command with a variable assignment it does not get set as a variable in the shell, only for the environment of the specific command you ran
[07:00:16] <rascul> seanicus it's only set in the environment for that command
[07:00:28] <phogg> seanicus: basically what happens is that the variable is set after fork but before exec

[07:06:08] <seanicus> I think I understand now.  It is...rather unintuitive.
[07:06:37] <phogg> seanicus: the thing to remember is that env vars came first, shell vars later. The shell is just doing something logical with the environment

[09:14:02] <farhan> its an Ubuntu host

[09:15:26] <farhan> sure!
[09:15:31] <farhan> wonder what the best way to share this is...
[09:17:34] <TJ-> farhan: on an Ubuntu server: "apt install pastebinit" then "pastebinit <( journalctl -b -1 )" to capture the log from the previous boot
[09:18:47] <TJ-> farhan: I'm assuming the previous boot had this happen of course! You can check all the recorded boots with "journalctl --list-boots" and use an index shown there after -b
[09:21:27] <farhan> what exactly does that get you?
[09:21:41] <farhan> pastes everything since the last boot?
[09:22:13] <TJ-> farhan: everything during the last boot (-1)

[14:56:21] <denny> you can what now? :)
[14:56:53] <denny> I can't immediately think of a reason I need that, but I bet it will come up soon enough.
[14:57:32] <omegatron> I have here a bash-based package manager and you use that to store the program's parameters in an immutable way
[14:57:39] <denny> Samian: looks like you're missing some library/header/dev files to do with something called fbgemm ?
[14:57:43] <omegatron> there are plenty of reasons ..
[14:58:19] <Samian> thanks denny
[14:59:28] <velix> SOURCE_DIR="${HOME}" <-- that makes no sense. Why not "$HOME" ?
[15:00:24] <omegatron> you should always put curly brackets around variables, so it's clear where they start AND end

[15:00:47] <omegatron> otherwise "${HOME}" and "$HOME" are equivalent

[15:23:28] <hexnewbie> Is there any tutorial on what's the correct thing to do when OpenVPN certificates generated by easy-rsa expire? I know how to lamely resign the certs manually with 'openssl' so the setup continues to work, but that does not update the database or anything. pkitool --sign complains that there is already a certificate of the same CN (DUH!!!).
[15:23:39] <hexnewbie> I can allow non-unique CNs, but that feels like the wrong thing to do to *renew* an existing cert

[15:26:27] <lyndog> My external keyboard just stopped working. :( it does not appear in lsusb when I unplug and plug it back in. I am not super familiar with how Linux handles misbehaving hardware, is it possible that it has been somehow blacklisted? I am suspecting a hardware problem but I want to rule out a software/firmware issue to avoid sending it back or buying a new one.

[18:28:57] <jkhsjdhjs> hey, I have a question about open source licenses. I created the project esp32-am2302 together with a friend. The structure of the project is based on esp32-websocket, a different project licensed under GPLv3. We also initially had our files component.mk and CMakeLists.txt copied from the esp32-websocket repository (about 6 lines in total), but have since removed and or completely changed them. Now
[18:28:57] <jkhsjdhjs> someone is asking us to change the license from GPLv3 to apache 2, which makes sense since the esp-idf itself is also licensed under apache 2. However, I'm not sure if we're allowed to do so since the project structure and initial makefiles are based on a GPLv3 project. So how far do software licenses go?

[19:57:33] <fakuve> Hey whatsup taichovskies and Bethovens of the Digital stuff. Has anyone used a bluettoh TUI , or a GTK similar to simplify what `bluetoothctl` does?
