[14:11:29] <lisp123> What's a good workflow for posting org files and having GitHub automatically publish them as GitHub Pages?
[14:12:13] <lisp123> Is there an org -> html converter? I basically want to maintain a simple coding blog, but getting annoyed at Medium. But at the same time, I want it to be as painless as possible - basically type in org, press a couple of buttons and publish
[14:33:29] <Demosthenex> lisp123: yes, we export to hrml
[14:33:44] <Demosthenex> do some casual searching on org-mode, html, and blog :P
[14:34:56] <Demosthenex> and i can't comment on github, after all, who uses it ? :P
[14:35:32] <lisp123> demosthenex: thanks, will do :-)
[14:35:55] <Demosthenex> i use nikola for my site though. most org exports are fairly plain, though it can be customized extensively
[14:36:09] <Demosthenex> i just have zero interest in messing with html
[14:36:33] <lisp123> I used to spend hours trying to make the perfect static site generator, but at this stage, I just want to write & publish
[14:36:53] <lisp123> I tried writing html directly, but it becomes a pain (with all the <p> tags especially)
[14:37:05] <yeti>  been there
[14:37:12] <lisp123> and org mode is life, so I should assimilate everything into org :P
[14:39:23] <yeti> only thing mising is an org-brain html-export that doesnt suck
[14:39:52] <lisp123> yeti: are you doing a wiki style page using org-brain? I was thinking that just now
[14:40:24] <yeti> as desktop wiki it is ok...  the export still is beyond my elisp capabilities
[14:40:53] <yeti> so I export some stuff as org losing some org-brain features that way
[14:41:12] <lisp123> yeti: interesting
[14:41:37] <yeti> https://yeti.tilde.institute/brain/unsorted.org  vs  https://yeti.tilde.institute/brain/unsorted.html
[14:41:42] <yeti> ugly... but a start
[14:42:16] <lisp123> looks reasonable
[14:42:30] <yeti> but that awk block shows up in the brain view
[14:42:53] <yeti> need a way to hide it from there or have it auto-included on each page on export only
[14:43:36] <lisp123> sorry, i'm a bit of a noob, what do you mean by awk block?
[14:43:54] <lisp123> I might copy your approach, it actually looks not too bad
[14:44:09] <yeti> the code that makes that navigation is a babel awk block
[14:44:39] <yeti> sure some emacs demigods can do better things in milliseconds...
[14:44:45] <yeti> but I'm not there yet
[14:45:12] <yeti> and one other thing that may help a lot is hidden in the makefile
[14:45:20] <lisp123> ah you mean the part in #BEGIN_SRC ... #END_SRC?
[14:45:25] <yeti> yip
[14:45:43] <lisp123> yeah I can see as a perfectionist it would be annoying to see it on end of every page
[14:45:51] <yeti> https://yeti.tilde.institute/brain/Makefile <<< the rebuild-all-blurb at the end
[14:46:16] <yeti> just a 1st hack from yesterday
[14:46:28] <yeti> needs lots of rethinking
[14:46:41] <lisp123> fair enough
[14:47:01] <yeti> I want to keep my style stuff in a #+setupfile: xxx.org
[14:47:22] <yeti> so no external css is needed and every exported html is one file only
[14:47:33] <yeti> (except for pics or tangled stuff)
[14:47:44] <lisp123> yeah that makes sense
[14:48:01] <lisp123> its a rabbithole though, I'm burned out because I keep changing what I do
[14:48:04] <yeti> but changing the file with the style defs someway shall trigger rebuilding all files using it
[14:48:51] <yeti> probably later like: look which files include that setupfile and rebuild them
[14:49:16] <lisp123> fair enough
[14:49:18] <yeti> probably not doable in a way that runs on gmake AND bmake
[14:49:21] <yeti> :-(
[14:50:22] <lisp123> perhaps with elisp you could do something?
[14:50:36] <yeti> not yet
[14:50:41] <lisp123> do you do much programming in elisp? once you take the plunge its not too bad
[14:51:04] <yeti> my to do list is infected with dark energy
[14:51:22] <yeti> elisp is in it but not near the top
[14:51:33] <yeti> :-/
[14:51:55] <lisp123> yeti: :P
[14:52:29] <yeti> maybe I should look more at eshell scripting
[14:52:52] <yeti> which is a split minded elisp
[14:52:58] <yeti> just with 2 representations
[14:53:34] <lisp123> I can imagine it would be worth the time investment
[14:53:37] <lisp123> in the long run

[15:10:17] <empwilli_> I recently get "org-capture: Capture abort: Unknown template placeholder: "%^G"" when I try to execute my capture commands. I suspect that it has something to do with native-comp and just reinstalled all my elpa packages & cleaned the native-comp cache but no success. Has anyone an idea?
[15:13:30] <tyson2> maybe you could post your template in a pastebin
[15:13:48] <empwilli_> give me a sec
[15:14:24] <empwilli_> https://pastebin.com/ZQzjAtPm
[15:15:10] <empwilli_> I don't know exactly when it stopped working but it worked for a while so I don't think that there is an issue with the template.. (at least if there where no breaking changes with templates0
[15:16:50] <tyson2> just as a test I would reduce the template to the absolute minimum
[15:18:24] <empwilli_> apparently it's the %^G
[15:18:41] <tyson2> also I would try emacs -q with just org loaded
[15:21:02] <empwilli_> oh boy, emacs withouth evil bindings. let's see how i get around :D
[15:21:07] <tyson2> perhaps there is some kind of hidden character in the template.  Try re-creating it and see what happens
[15:22:18] <empwilli_> nah, it's the %^G
[15:22:49] <empwilli_> I think there's an issue with my locally installed org from elpa and the org from the emacs repo... but I try :)
[15:24:06] <empwilli_> and it's broken for emacs -q, as well
