You can do startx without exec, but that means you can just kill the Xorg session and get a shell. For startx to work, you need either suid, or elogind (nvm how terrible it is).

[11:07:57] <labrador> Andrew, who cares...
[11:08:01] <gnoo> Andrew: freedesktop, i think
[11:08:07] <Andrew> gnoo: Oh, my fault
[11:08:17] <Andrew> Anyways, I see many distributions shipping GNU with Wayland by default
[11:08:18] <Andrew> *GNOME
[11:08:23] * gnoo doesn't like freedesktop
[11:08:39] <Andrew> I don't know much about what freedesktop does.
[11:08:41] <labrador> Andrew, cause gnome is the best implementation of wayland in a traditional DE

[11:08:53] <labrador> There's sway too,but its a WM
[11:08:55] <Andrew> That's right, but I don't use a DE :)
[11:09:00] <labrador> KDE lags behind
[11:09:06] <Andrew> Well, if you consider Emacs a DE, sure.
[11:09:07] <labrador> Xfce hasn't even begun
[11:09:12] <Andrew> (And it kind-of is...)
[11:09:21] <Andrew> freedesktop.org hosts the development of free and open source software, focused on interoperability and shared technology for open-source graphical and desktop systems. We do not ourselves produce a desktop, but we aim to help others to do so.

[11:10:17] <Andrew> Well, I've got other ways for notifications
[11:10:18] <labrador> gnoo, dbus literally is ipc
[11:10:23] <labrador> Whats your problem with it?
[11:10:26] <labrador> It works fine
[11:10:27] <corwin> Obligatory: https://xkcd.com/378/
[11:10:31] <Andrew> I hate dbus, it's complicated!
[11:10:40] <labrador> Andrew, without it ipc would be a pita to work with
[11:10:41] <gnoo> no XDG_RUNTIME_DIR without suid'ed binary (usually elogind) because freedesktop said so
[11:10:43] <Andrew> My way of notifications:  Writing to a FIFO pipe that goes into my status bar
[11:10:53] <labrador> I do not want that kinda stuff in my pc tho Andrew 
[11:10:56] <Andrew> labrador: Use simple FIFOs?
[11:11:00] <labrador> Its not reliable and can break in many ways
[11:11:03] <Andrew> ???
[11:11:08] <Andrew> I feel the total opposite!
[11:11:10] <gnoo> labrador: do you think starting applications is the job of a service manager like runit or shepherd or of dbus?
[11:11:13] <labrador> Andrew, do you know what IPC is?
[11:11:15] <Andrew> Dbus breaks on my system for multiple ways.
[11:11:20] <Andrew> Inter proccess communication?
[11:11:45] <labrador> and why do you think having each process make its own ipc is better than a central orchestration like dbus?
[11:12:00] <gnoo> labrador: check if you have a notification daemon running, if it is, kill it
[11:12:02] <Andrew> Currently dbus breaks a lot, personal opinion.
[11:12:08] <Andrew> Anyways, proccesses shouldn't exist at all.
[11:12:12] <Andrew> http://metamodular.com/Common-Lisp/lispos.html
[11:12:18] <labrador> > proccesses shouldn't exist at all.
[11:12:20] <labrador> hahahaha
[11:12:22] <gnoo> then try `notify-send asdf' , it will auto spawn dbus

[11:17:45] <labrador> Even if you think its better
[11:17:57] <damo22> hurd takes the unix philosophy to the extreme, each driver in its own process with RPCs between them as IPC
[11:18:02] <DiffieHellman> GNU replaced Unix a while ago, but okay.

[11:20:59] <Andrew> What exactly does hybrid and monolothic mean here?

[11:21:23] <Andrew> Address spaces?
[11:21:29] <damo22> all things in the same process
[11:21:33] <White_Flame> I don't care if you like it, it doesn't scale, has no standards, and ends up super slow.  That' snot opinion ;)

[11:22:14] <labrador> That is what unix was supposed to be like anyway
[11:22:20] <damo22> hybrid model of kernel means you put some drivers in userspace and some in the kernel

[11:22:30] <White_Flame> also, "GNU" is misleading as it's still absolutely "a unix" in everything but trademark ;)
[11:22:50] <labrador> White_Flame, yeah its UNIX

[11:23:08] <damo22> isnt it just a POSIX implementation?
[11:23:19] <labrador> damo22, and POSIX is about equal to the SuS
[11:23:33] <labrador> There's not much difference
[11:23:39] <gnoo> Andrew: monolithic -> has everything in-tree. like how the linux source is mostly non-free drivers because it is monolithic 
[11:23:48] <White_Flame> posix is just an abstraction from unix
[11:24:04] <labrador> White_Flame, to get certified unix you need to adhere to SUS
[11:24:10] <gnoo> microkernel -> has only the core functions in tree while everything else will be implemented as modules on top of it
[11:24:11] <labrador> Thats the def of unix nowadays
[11:24:13] <DiffieHellman> White_Flame: GNU wasn't derived from Unix code, so it is not a Unix\
[11:24:30] <labrador> DiffieHellman, the design is POSIX. So SUS could probably certify it

[11:28:57] <labrador> Thats the one made by Bell Labs
[11:29:22] <DiffieHellman> Unix was the name of a specific proprietary OS, using it to name other OS's that aren't at least derived from the original Unix source is just wrong really.

[11:29:55] <DiffieHellman> damo22: *nix catches with "Linux" and "Unix", which aren't the same thing.

[11:34:15] <labrador> DiffieHellman, the correct term is GNU is mostly UNIX
[11:34:17] <DiffieHellman> Since people call non-Unix's a Unix, thus confusing everyone.
[11:34:22] <labrador> Not perfectly tho as gnoo says
[11:34:26] <White_Flame> it doesn't confuse anybody
[11:34:40] <labrador> The term White_Flame and I use is the correct one
[11:34:45] <DiffieHellman> It does indeed. People say "Unix shell" instead of bash shell

[11:36:01] <gnoo> labrador: do you consider any implementation of iso c like musl or glibc to be iso ?
[11:36:05] <DiffieHellman> bash implements POSIX shell, but that requires a specific setting - by default the support is not 100%
[11:36:07] <labrador> gnoo, yes
[11:36:28] <labrador> DiffieHellman, that counts enough if it only extends
[11:36:32] <labrador> Not changes
[11:36:34] <gnoo> labrador: so, unix is an os that is somehow both gnu and openbsd and freebsd and everything else too?
[11:36:43] <labrador> gnoo, UNIX is a standard
[11:36:46] <labrador> Not an OS
[11:36:54] <AwesomeAdam54321> the standard is POSIX and SUS
[11:36:58] <gnoo> no, unix is an os. posix is a standard
[11:37:02] <labrador> Many OSs can comply to POSIX and SUS
[11:37:06] <labrador> And then they become UNIX
[11:37:10] <DiffieHellman> labrador: The Single Unix Specification is the standard, not just "Unix"
[11:37:17] <gnoo> they become unix-like not unix itself
[11:37:29] <DiffieHellman> Please stop being wrong :3
[11:37:35] <damo22> i think GNU Mes is pretty amazing, bootstrapping C from a minimal set of stages that you can hand-verify if you want to
[11:37:50] <labrador> gnoo, when you get SUS you're allowed to call your product UNIX
[11:37:59] <labrador> So makes sense that SUS makes stuff UNIX
[11:38:13] <DiffieHellman> GNU doesn't meet SUS, so therefore it is not a Un'x
[11:38:51] <labrador> DiffieHellman, it does..its just not submitted for certification.
[11:39:11] <DiffieHellman> Until the certification has passed, it's not a Unix, please stop being wrong.
[11:39:31] <DiffieHellman> Even if you were right and GNU was actually a Unix, that's just confusing and you should use a name that makes sense.

[11:50:48] <AwesomeAdam54321> Oh, I thought DDE was agnostic
[11:51:04] <damo22> it might be, but no one has ported latest linux to it
[11:51:24] <damo22> while rump already has all of netbsd support
[11:51:52] <damo22> as in, the drivers from netbsd kernel can be compiled as libraries
[11:52:01] <DiffieHellman> Epic
[11:52:46] <damo22> see my talk from fosdem here: https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/dzammit/
[11:54:36] <DiffieHellman> 3>64.9MiB for 30 min Th's pretty impressive
[11:54:36] <damo22> netbsd drivers provide a stable api to access the hardware via rump
[11:55:33] <AwesomeAdam54321> It would definitely not require much work compared to keeping track of Linux's internal API, now that I think about it
[11:56:14] <damo22> yeah if someone wanted to design a framework to wrap around linux and maintain it, id use it
[11:57:44] <damo22> DiffieHellman: yeah i dont know how they transcoded my 400MB mp4 video to 65MB webm
[11:58:10] <AwesomeAdam54321> maybe it was done using ffmpeg

[12:27:53] <janneke> abut two years ago, we implemented the childhurd feature in guix
[12:27:57] <janneke> *about
[12:28:57] <janneke> just having a hurd vm service running is real cool...the next step would be to run it on a machine
[12:29:33] <janneke> i'm sure the hurd port in guix will pick up more momentum when that happens
[12:30:31] <AwesomeAdam54321> It would be very cool when subhurds can be used for guix builds
[12:31:22] <AwesomeAdam54321> *guix builds can use subhurds
[12:31:54] <janneke> AwesomeAdam54321: we already have that in guix
[12:32:08] <AwesomeAdam54321> oh, ok
[12:32:35] <janneke> in my /etc/machines i can offload to my hurd vm, that's how the guix build farm does it too

[23:04:53] <White_Flame> (I think I mentioned it last time, too, not sure if it was someone else :) )

[23:05:14] <White_Flame> once it's up, it's up though
[23:05:20] <White_Flame> so just a one time cost
