[00:00:17] <hardwire> It would be nice to offer things like smooth fade ins for lower thirds on top of content that doesn't change often.
[00:00:21] <another|> still not sure what you mean by async stream
[00:00:39] <hardwire> well xvfb doesn't have a framerate. Agreed?
[00:01:14] <hardwire> however ffmpeg + x11grab grabs at a given rate.  Thus xvfb is async and used for compositing.

[00:02:35] <hardwire> My initial question was if ffmpeg had an alternative method of receiving frame updates rather than through a grabber.. potentially to reduce requirements overall.
[00:04:56] <hardwire> I could use a python script to attempt to provide frames at a given rate (sync).. BtbN expressed that looking for differences in a stream of image content is not cpu intensive compared to the encoding and I shouldn't be focused there and should instead rely on ffmpeg to do what is best.  I would still prefer to have a method of sending frame updates or partial frame updates to an ffmpeg input at any given rate (async).

[00:06:01] <hardwire> It seems like a virtual x11 framebuffer is the appropriate source for providing that for now.
[00:06:45] <BtbN> Video streaming operates at a constant framerate

[00:07:09] <BtbN> so even if you somehow managed to provide vfr input to ffmpeg, it'll have to convert it to cfr again, and then encode that cfr content
[00:07:18] <BtbN> so there will be no notable save in CPU usage
[00:07:23] <hardwire> BtbN: if you used a camera and pointed it at a person.. does that person (outside of the camera) have a framerate?
[00:07:39] <BtbN> What does that have to do with anything?
[00:07:51] <hardwire> I know streaming requires a constant framerate (the output)
[00:07:57] <hardwire> I'm asking about how to best handle the input.
[00:08:07] <BtbN> You seem to have a very wrong idea about what part of the whole process is the most CPU intensive
[00:08:28] <BtbN> x11grab grabbing the framebuffer 60 times a second is next to neglibible compares to the encoder doing its job

[00:09:03] <hardwire> I.. don't.  I was attempting to learn more about any encoder pre-optimization I could do rather than focusing on a rigid fps.
[00:09:43] <hardwire> another|: how would you provide composited image data to ffmpeg in order to stream it?
[00:09:53] <BtbN> Have you heard of OBS?
[00:09:59] <hardwire> Yup.

[00:17:44] <BtbN> But keep in mind: OBS also in the end will encode a 30 or 60 fps video, using the same encoder ffmpeg uses
[00:17:50] <BtbN> So CPU load will be near identical
[00:18:04] <hardwire> just xvfb and ffmpeg didn't seem like a lot.
[00:18:21] <hardwire> However the performance was worth working through.

[00:19:48] <hardwire> Y'all are super fun.
[00:21:16] * another| puts on a party hat
[00:21:54] <BtbN> Every question you had regarding ffmpeg was answered multiple times. Are you seriously upset someones recommending you a better way to achive your actual goal?
[00:23:52] <hardwire> I'm upset at implied judgement that I should know better.. not for the recommendation which I appreciate.  I may be completely wrong thinking that OBS utilizes the underlaying libs that ffmpeg also does in order to do similar work.  I'll look in to how OBS studio does things.
[00:25:18] <hardwire> There's a good chance I'll have to rig things up using a system with a head in order to utilize obs studio no a system that doesn't.. and then work through any things that may make multiple streams not work there.  But for now I'll stick to x11grab and ffmpeg which is stable.  The initial question of if there is a solid way to provide async frame updates appears to be just use xvfb.. but also don't.
[00:26:12] <hardwire> I was doing my best to provide good info and be contextual.
[00:26:19] <BtbN> If all you want is to stream an image slideshow, you can probably do that with ffmpeg on its own, with just the images as input.
[00:27:24] <hardwire> I had considered prerendering a bunch of images for that.  I am also going to be sending out of band content to the live stream api and matching that up with when images/transitions happen would be more difficult.
[00:27:43] <hardwire> I appreciate the feedback.
[00:27:52] <BtbN> If you want to do any kind of complex scene compositing, there is no realistic way around OBS
[00:28:22] <BtbN> You can lua script and remote control it if you want it to be a somewhat interaction-free setup
[00:28:25] <hardwire> Sounds like it.  I'll need to look in to how to set up a stream and provide realtime updates.

[08:30:44] <JaysonLarose> specifically, I'm getting alternating "PTS <x>, next:<y> invalid dropping st:0" "DTS <x>, next:<y> st:0 invalid dropping" messages. <x> is a large integer, <y> is a smaller integer. <x> and <y> are identical for each pair of messages, and I'm getting a pair of messages at a rate of 1 per frame.

[10:16:00] <a1rwulf> what's the correct way to obtain if a video is 8bit or 10bit?
[10:16:00] <a1rwulf> I've tried to find it and people suggest it should be found in bits_per_raw_sample, but I'm still a bit unsure.
[10:17:32] <a1rwulf> The comments in libavcodec let me think bits_per_raw_sample/bits_per_coded_sample are meant for audio stuff

[16:31:16] <Forlorn> Hi, if I set the output as udp or tcp or whatever, does it mean it just sends the data to that given address and port?
[16:31:17] <blackop> i actually wanna just change the container any format to .mp4 without loose
[16:31:27] <Forlorn> Is it a client or a server?
[16:31:55] <Forlorn> does it listen or just connects and try to write, or does it accept incoming connections?
[16:33:42] <alexandre[m]> blackop: i don't think ffmpeg by itself can do that, you might be able to do it with a bash script though, let me see if i find it
[16:34:04] <Forlorn> Is the music player (the client) intended to be the actual listener?
[16:34:13] <Forlorn> so the client is the server?
[16:34:21] <Forlorn> Confusing...
[16:34:28] <alexandre[m]> blackop: try this https://superuser.com/questions/1307575/recursively-search-mp4-files-and-process-them-with-ffmpeg

[16:34:59] <blackop> according to this link: https://askubuntu.com/questions/214199/how-do-i-add-and-or-keep-subtitles-when-converting-video
[16:35:08] <blackop> but i am not sure which one to use for better result
[16:35:29] <blackop> i wanna change the container without loose but it s nice to have them smaller size in .mp4
[16:35:43] <blackop> but to make it compressed/small size does it mean re-encoding?
[16:35:57] <blackop> cant i compress without encoding?
[16:36:30] *** Quits: minimal (~minimal@user/minimal) (Quit: Leaving)
[16:36:37] <alexandre[m]> blackop: i think so, but i'm no expert in ffmpeg :)
[16:36:45] <blackop> my concern is time and quality loss.. encoding takes time and not sure if it is giving same quality
[16:37:47] <alexandre[m]> why do you need it to be mp4 though? any device that doesn't support mkv (well... mkv is just a container, it can have basically any codec inside)
[16:38:00] <alexandre[m]> * codec inside)?
[16:38:17] <alexandre[m]> ffmpeg will transcode with whatever quality you tell it to
[16:38:41] <blackop> alexandre[m]: well some device i have dont support .mkv and .avi
[16:38:57] <blackop> and .mp4 seems to be standard nowadays
[16:39:15] <blackop> with less space
[16:41:48] *** Quits: AbleBacon (~AbleBacon@user/AbleBacon) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[16:42:04] <alexandre[m]> if you just run ffmpeg with defaults (ffmpeg <input.ext> <out.mp4>) does it keep a good quality?
[16:42:26] <alexandre[m]> if so, change that script to run that command, if not, you have to tune the compression parameters and so on
[16:44:13] <blackop> alexandre[m]: it doesnt encode i guess. it outputs same size
[16:44:18] <blackop> of the source video
[16:44:43] <blackop> does compressing mean encoding?
[16:44:46] <alexandre[m]> isn't that what you want 🤔
[16:44:48] <alexandre[m]> * you want? 🤔
[16:44:54] <blackop> can i do that qithout quality loss?
[16:45:08] <blackop> alexandre[m]: actually i want more things lol
[16:45:29] <blackop> ii wanna change container to mp4 without quality loss but with less space
[16:46:12] <alexandre[m]> blackop: you're asking the impossible then, you can choose a codec that "looks" better, but if you use less space you will lose quality (even if it's not noticeable)
[16:46:36] <blackop> so compressing means encoding
[16:46:49] <blackop> that can cause quality loss
[16:47:27] <alexandre[m]> AFAIK encoding just means putting the video/audio on a container, but i might be wrong
[16:47:46] <blackop> so compression = quality loss?
[16:47:58] <alexandre[m]> either way, you can't compress something (which is likely already compressed) and hope for it to become smaller
[16:47:59] <blackop> there are large .mkv or .avi files..
[16:48:30] <blackop> well if i change parameters and set codec again mp4 output is getting smaller
[16:48:36] <blackop> even half size in some videos
[16:48:56] <blackop> but process is taking too long + not sure if there is quality loss
[16:49:00] <blackop> i cant notice with my eyes
[16:49:45] <alexandre[m]> again, if the file is smaller there is some quality loss, it might be unnoticeable, but it's there
[16:49:54] <blackop> for example there are some mkv files encoded already with h264 and aac or ac3 codecs
[16:49:59] <alexandre[m]> the more it takes the better the compression (better quality and less size)
[16:50:05] <alexandre[m]> * the more time it takes
[16:50:18] <blackop> if i set h264 and ac3 again to convert them to mp4 via ffmpeg size is decreasing
[16:50:48] <blackop> i see
[16:51:08] <alexandre[m]> hmm, i think .mp4 only supports mpeg-4 and mpeg-2 codecs, not h264. again i might be wrong, codecs and all this is not my strong point :D
[16:52:08] <alexandre[m]> nvm, it supports h264
[16:52:08] <blackop> it does h264
[16:52:16] <blackop> even h265
[16:52:21] <blackop> or x265
[16:52:39] <blackop> but i dont know why when i encode with 265 it doesnt show thumbnails
[16:52:58] <blackop> 265 is recent and smaller size
[16:53:43] <alexandre[m]> 🤷aren't the thumbnails generated by the OS?
[16:54:21] <alexandre[m]> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54717175/how-do-i-add-a-custom-thumbnail-to-a-mp4-file-using-ffmpeg
[16:54:38] <blackop> well it is enabled in OS
[16:54:38] <alexandre[m]> that's for a custom thumbnail though
[16:54:51] <blackop> but for a reason, i dont know why, some shows some doesnt
[16:54:56] <blackop> i guess it is related to encoding
[16:55:21] <blackop> by the way which audio codec better? aac or ac3 ?
[16:56:31] <alexandre[m]> aac from what i'mm seein
[16:56:32] <alexandre[m]> s/seein/seeing/
[16:56:57] <alexandre[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/askgbh/ac3_vs_aac_for_51surround_sound_in_2019/
[16:57:14] <alexandre[m]> depends on the audio it seems
[16:57:33] <alexandre[m]> if it's just 2.0/2.1 then aac, if 5.1 then ac2
[16:57:35] <alexandre[m]> s/ac2/ac3/
[16:57:55] <blackop> ac3 is dolby they say
[16:58:03] <blackop> doesnt make much difference anyway
[16:58:16] <alexandre[m]> btw, about codecs/quality http://video.1ko.ch/codec-comparison/index.html
[16:58:52] <microchip_> AC-4 FTW!
[17:00:07] <alexandre[m]> assuming he even has problem with mkv format because his devices don't support it, they won't support ac-4 either :D (unless it's backwards compatible ofc)
[17:00:28] <microchip_> if the claims on Wikipedia are true about AC-4, I can't wait of having an encoder in FFmpeg!
[17:01:28] <microchip_> alexandre[m]: that's always the case with new formats. Poor support by existing equipment

[17:16:36] <blackop> i better change containers still
[17:16:52] <blackop> plus i need to add subs too for some videos
[17:16:54] <blackop> soft sub is ok
[17:16:58] <alexandre[m]> well, you can buy a raspberry pi or some sort of SBC to plug to the tv, sure, it's a patchy solution, but would work :D
[17:16:59] <blackop> which i can enable or disable
[17:17:20] <blackop> alexandre[m]: i have rpi already but using it for retro games mostly
[17:17:24] <blackop> and kodi
[17:17:42] <alexandre[m]> well, if you have kodi then there u go :)
[17:17:45] <blackop> my harddisk drives with videos are on windows shared network
[17:17:46] <microchip_> alexandre[m]: I use an nVIDIA Shield to circumvent the issue. Runs Kodi great
[17:18:04] <blackop> i can directly access my videos directly from any device on network
[17:18:11] <microchip_> blackop: Sounds like Kodi is a match for you ;)
[17:18:12] <blackop> it is more easier for me i guess
[17:18:17] <blackop> kodi can have issues sometimes
[17:18:33] <blackop> microchip_: well rpi is not connected to TV
[17:18:48] <blackop> i am not sure if there is kodi app for samsung tv
[17:18:57] <blackop> there is plex but..
[17:19:01] <microchip_> there isn't
[17:19:10] <blackop> there is plex app
[17:19:27] <microchip_> I have no clue about plex
[17:20:30] <microchip_> (it's a knock off of Kodi/XBMC and is invasive in pushing you to pay)
[17:20:46] <blackop> yes..
[17:20:54] <microchip_> that's all I know ;)
[17:21:22] <blackop> i installed plex server on pc
[17:21:26] <blackop> added some videos to test
[17:21:38] <microchip_> Kodi isn't perfect, but you can still correct things
[17:21:39] <blackop> when i wanted to watch them on my iphone continously it asked money
[17:21:41] <alexandre[m]> i think there was jellyfin for tizen
[17:21:43] <alexandre[m]> not sure
[17:22:10] <blackop> i paid about $4 but not sure if it was for once or they will ask every month/year
[17:22:43] <blackop> it is a lot of work.. adding videos on kodi or plex
[17:23:02] <blackop> direct access to network shared disks sounds better option sometimes
[17:24:00] <blackop> ok what i need is:
[17:24:03] <alexandre[m]> can't you just access the share on kodi?
[17:24:14] <microchip_> blackop: I have NFS running on my NAS with Kodii on the NV Shield. Works greate. I'm sure it'll work on the Pi
[17:24:20] <blackop> 1- add separated .srt files to videos
[17:24:34] <blackop> 2- convert videos to mp4 with h264 and ac3
[17:24:42] <blackop> and keep subs inside
[17:24:51] <blackop> videos might have multiple audios
[17:25:03] <blackop> like anime videos can have japanese and english audio
[17:25:09] <blackop> i would like to keep all audio and subs
[17:25:23] <microchip_> why mp4? mkv is far better and Kodi handles it just fine
[17:25:39] <blackop> how will i connect kodi from samsung tv?
[17:25:56] <blackop> should i connect rpi to TV?
[17:26:00] <microchip_> DLNA running on your server?
[17:26:09] <blackop> it is smb i guess
[17:26:21] <microchip_> not supported by Tizen
[17:26:44] <blackop> it automatically sees my network share at the moment
[17:26:52] <blackop> i shared them on windows pc
[17:26:57] <blackop> so using windows network share
[17:27:08] <blackop> i dont have a NAS unfortunately.. too expensive
[17:27:11] <blackop> i wish i had

[17:28:00] <microchip_> blackop: a "normal" computer stuffed with disks is also a NAS ;)
[17:28:24] <blackop> but it is using more power comparing a NAS?
[17:28:28] <blackop> i mean pc?
[17:28:58] <microchip_> depends on CPU, amount of disks, mobo, etc
[17:29:13] <blackop> any power efficient NAS ideas?
[17:29:16] <blackop> home made :p
[17:29:24] <blackop> i wish i had another rpi to make it NAS

[18:57:21] <blackop> how can i set quality or size?
[18:57:31] <kepstin> note that you will always get some quality loss when re-encoding lossy compressed video
[18:57:37] <blackop> i am just copy pasting from google results..
[18:57:46] <kepstin> do you actually need the video smaller, or do you just want it in mp4 container format?
[18:58:14] <blackop> well.. i want it in mp4 container keeping all audio and subtitles exist in source video
[18:58:26] <blackop> it is nice to have smaller but i dont want quality loss
[18:58:32] <blackop> or bigger file
[18:58:33] <kepstin> I'd recommend removing the "-c:v libx264" and "-c:a ac3" options, and add "-c copy"
[18:58:54] <kepstin> then it will use the audio and video as-is from the source file without re-encoding, so they will be the same size and quality.

[19:04:15] <kepstin> ah, huh, codec not supported. i thought the old mpeg4 codecs could be used in mp4 container, but I guess not :(
[19:04:38] <kepstin> do you need the container to be mp4, or would you be ok with, say, mkv instead?
[19:04:52] <blackop> i would like mp4 if possible..
[19:06:24] <kepstin> right. If you really want mp4 then you'd have to re-encode the video, which means the process will be slow and you're gonna have to choose encoding settings :(
[19:06:42] <blackop> and it will have quality loss?
[19:06:47] <blackop> and size will increase?
[19:07:17] <kepstin> size can be whatever you want, there will be some quality loss (how much depends on the size you pick)
[19:07:35] <blackop> at least same with the source file..
[19:08:44] <kepstin> the best you can do is "pretty close" if you're also trying to make the file smaller.
[19:09:50] <kepstin> if you use "-c:v libx264" then it will use default options that are the same as "-preset medium -crf 23"
[19:10:22] <kepstin> you can adjust the preset to e.g. "slow" or "veryslow" to improve encoder efficiency, and adjust the crf to pick the file size vs quality tradeoff
[19:10:38] <kepstin> smaller numbers of crf make bigger files. larger numbers of crf make lower quality.
[19:10:57] <blackop> i am new to ffmpeg..
[19:11:05] <blackop> just discovered how to run it on command line
[19:11:07] <blackop> last night
[19:11:39] <tomasklaen> I'm trying to convert a video to gif, and I'm getting strange results
[19:11:39] <tomasklaen> If I just do a dumb `-i in.mp4 out.gif`, I'll get a 1.1MB result where I can see undesirable dot pattern on the final image
[19:11:40] <tomasklaen> If I use filter `split[o1][o2][o1]palettegen[p][o2]fifo[o3][o3][p]paletteuse` (recommendation I found), I get a 3MB result that looks really good
[19:11:40] <tomasklaen> BUT, when I limit the palettegen to max_colors=10, I get a result that looks worse than the dumb in->out no filter run, but is 10% larger
[19:11:41] <tomasklaen> I thought I could use max_colors to tweak quality/size ratio, but even at lowest values the output is still larger than with no filters
[19:11:41] <tomasklaen> am I missing something?
[19:12:33] <kepstin> if you use fewer colors then it has to do more dithering (dot patterns) to approximate the desired colour, which makes the files larger
[19:13:17] <kepstin> sometimes denoising the video before doing the gif conversion can give better results. you might also want to scale it smaller.
[19:13:42] <blackop> some other videos are good to go with container change. maybe something wrong with current videos.
[19:13:49] <blackop> ok first thing first..
[19:13:50] <tomasklaen> so is there a way for me to control the size/quality ratio? because as it is its nice quality large, or shit quality large. but always large :)

[19:26:08] <tomasklaen> that is expected
[19:26:47] <kepstin> tomasklaen: an in-between option is to use bayer dithering; it's a deterministic pattern (same between frames) so it results in less differences in the gif encoding

[19:58:49] <kepstin> the 'lite' version is faster since it needs to sample fewer pixels, but it tends to produce more 'lines' in the output.

[20:03:07] <tomasklaen> its 1.07 vs 1.22 MB respectively. the only thing that's different between encodes is sierra2 vs sierra2_4a dither param, so I think I'm just gonna go with sierra2 and ignore the 4a version. speed is not that different to warrant an increase in filesize

[20:14:46] <tomasklaen> do I have to use reserve_transparent if I'm using max_colors lower than 256? lets say I use max_colors 40 with no reserve_transparent param. will transparent color be one of the 40, or will it be 41, or will transparency be dropped? can't seem to parse this from docs

[21:29:38] <tomasklaen> when I do "-i input.jpg output.png", it's actually saved as a single frame apng right? is there a difference between normal png and apng files? might there be an issue in this kind of conversion?

[21:31:14] <King_DuckZ> I found a sandbox solution so it should be safe to run it, but anyone knows where I can download it from? furq or durandal_1707 maybe?

[21:39:55] <tomasklaen> I guess ffmpeg has a png encoder, as ffmpeg -h encoder=png is giving me individualized outputs for png and apng, but I can't use png as -f format without getting errors?
[21:41:03] <another|> encoder != muxer
[21:43:51] <tomasklaen> so what is the way to encode basic single frame png images? because -f doesn't accept png
[21:44:12] <another|> -c:v png
[21:44:47] <tomasklaen> and format to set as apng?
[21:45:03] <AMM> iirc most image formats are under image2

[21:52:22] <Forsaken87> hey, I could use some help with the "v360" ffmpeg filter. When trying to use the "h_offset" option I always get "Option 'offset_h' not found". I already tried various different orders, even different option names that would make sense. In the according file on github it looks fine to me (as a non-ffmpeg developer) https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavfilter/vf_v360.c
[21:52:48] <Forsaken87> my current filter string looks like this: 'input=fisheye:in_stereo=sbs:ih_fov=180:iv_fov=180:h_fov=120:v_fov=70:pitch=-25:output=sg:out_stereo=tb:offset_h=0.1'
[21:55:02] <Forsaken87> Oops. I obviously meant "h_offset" and 'input=fisheye:in_stereo=sbs:ih_fov=180:iv_fov=180:h_fov=120:v_fov=70:pitch=-25:output=sg:out_stereo=tb:h_offset=0.1'. that change was from desperately trying around
