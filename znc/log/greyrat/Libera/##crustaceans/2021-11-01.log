[05:00:33] <dimadima> i will google :)
[05:01:02] <dimadima> hmm nothing concrete it seems
[05:01:15] <dimadima> i guess with diablo 2 it was: "Diablo 2: Resurrected is a full reboot of Blizzard's hack-and-slash RPG first released two decades ago. It sports updated graphics, 4K gaming, and all the content from Diablo II and its expansions."
[05:01:32] <dimadima> 4k makes sense, but why can't you just render GLQuake at 4k?

[19:34:43] <dimadima> and in general ppl who're there for the hardcore computation topics
[19:38:37] <dimadima> i don't understand how it's november 1 and i have a fruit fly infestation
[19:38:54] <indigo> Hey, me too dimadima!
[19:39:06] <indigo> One of the onions I bought rotted and caused a bunch of fruit flies
[19:39:25] <dimadima> for me i think it was some pears
[19:39:41] <dimadima> but i'm not even sure and this is easily the worst case of fruit flies i've ever had lol
[19:40:52] <dimadima> interesting the fruit flies eat onions
[19:41:00] <dimadima> russian fruit flies i guess
[19:41:14] <companion_cube> if you need a way of dealing with them, I have one
[19:41:31] <dimadima> what is it companion_cube
[19:42:31] <companion_cube> in a mason jar, put apple cider vinegar with a hint of dishwater soap
[19:42:41] <companion_cube> put plastic wrap on top but with small holes in it
[19:42:59] <companion_cube> basically the vinegar attracts flies like crazy, the plastic is there to keep  them in
[19:43:06] <companion_cube> and the dish soap kills them :s
[19:43:22] <dimadima> how small are the holes?
[19:43:40] <dimadima> it's kind of hard to poke holes in plastic wrap without making those holes spread?
[19:44:01] <companion_cube> big enough for a fruit fly :D
[19:44:06] <dimadima> :)
[19:44:10] <companion_cube> yeah I mean, don't put pressure on the holes afterwards
[19:44:11] <dimadima> they're small little fuckers
[19:44:25] <companion_cube> if you put that in your kitchen, after a little while you should see a ton of little husks in the vinegar
[19:44:42] <dimadima> i've never had them bad enough that would warrant even idle posting to IRC lol
[19:44:45] <dimadima> hard to believe
[19:44:54] <dimadima> i'm excited to try this, thank you companion_cube
[19:45:11] <companion_cube> good luck!
[19:45:16] <companion_cube> I had a really bad infestation a few years ago
[19:45:27] <companion_cube> (kept a composting bin around for too long)
[19:45:34] <leon> it should also work with just a little bowl, vinegar and dish soap
[19:45:37] <companion_cube> so I found that on the web, and it worked pretty well for me
[19:45:41] <companion_cube> yeah possibly
[19:45:42] <dimadima> for me it's always been if you remove the source, they disappear in a day or two
[19:45:46] <leon> we use that method pretty often, no plastic neccessary
[19:45:46] <companion_cube> I used a glass back then
[19:45:55] <companion_cube> ah, good to know
[19:51:32] <Geekingfrog> damn, I needed to know that 2 weeks ago
[19:51:48] <Geekingfrog> after 10 days away, they are all gone
[19:53:43] <indigo> I do the same thing with the vinegar + plastic except I don't do the dish soap
[19:56:58] <jjuran> dimadima: I imagine the ops are more sympathetic to announcements of tech-adjacent art performances than to news about VC-funded tech companies :-)
[19:56:59] <indigo> dimadima: My wife also has sticky traps
[20:09:15] <dimadima> jjuran: oh i'm sure they are. i'm just personally concerned about being off-topic; it's how i ended up in this channel :)
[20:09:32] <dimadima> indigo: but aren't those terribly cruel
[20:10:07] <dimadima> i have, like, some sort of social anxiety or something
[20:12:22] <indigo> Not as cruel as any other ones?
[20:12:45] <indigo> Heh, at my last company they had a rat problem in the building
[20:12:52] <dimadima> indigo: i was jkjk :) sort of a reference to the rodent glue traps
[20:12:52] <indigo> So they put sticky traps everywhere
[20:12:55] <dimadima> yeah
[20:13:08] <indigo> So one morning one of my coworkers goes into the lactation room
[20:13:13] <dimadima> oh jesus
[20:13:27] <indigo> And sees this giant fucking rat, stuck to the glue trap
[20:13:42] <companion_cube> 😱
[20:13:48] <indigo> Yeeeah
[20:14:21] <ngoldbaum> the rats need the space to express too!
[20:14:44] <jjuran> We first got glue traps for mice.  One of the traps caught a mouse while we were away for a few days.
[20:16:10] <jjuran> It was barely alive when I found it.  I searched online for a way to free it from the glue; turns out oil works.  I left it outside, but by that point I'm not sure it was moving anymore, and also it was cold and wet, so… :-(
[20:17:04] <jjuran> Though I have successfully released a small number of mice caught by my cat :-)

[20:49:44] <jjuran> You'd have to have clairvoyant knowledge of the hire's first day in advance.
[20:50:03] <Brekkjern> cb_: What is even the context of that?
[20:50:04] <Brekkjern> And also: https://youtu.be/qi-Q73RSF_c

[20:51:36] <cb_> Brekkjern: it's in the ttwitter trrending bar
[20:51:37] <jjuran> IIRC, someone named Simba was harassing Lobsters mods.  He passed away with the last couple years.
[20:52:27] <ngoldbaum> he was also a well-known troll in the furry community
[20:52:38] <ngoldbaum> his ban message from lobsters is a classic
[20:52:46] <Brekkjern> But 86K tweets about it?
[20:52:48] <ngoldbaum> “…culminating in a call for a race war”
[20:53:10] <ngoldbaum> twitter’s trending algorithm highlights all kind of random crap
[20:53:46] <ngoldbaum> it apparently has something to do with an indian reality show
[20:54:01] <Brekkjern> That explains the 86K tweets :P

[20:55:13] <Brekkjern> What even is that Mind Grenade post?
[20:55:19] <Brekkjern> I don't understand why it's on the site?
[20:55:26] <jjuran> SIMBA was also a DLL in Windows version whatever-I-don't-actually-care.  I guess Disney didn't care, either.
[20:59:15] <cb_> ngoldbaum: it gets bad if you disable geographical personalization
[20:59:23] <cb_> i've had big brother nigeria in my twitter trending for weeks
[20:59:42] <indigo> Brekkjern: That wiring is pretty gross, but it's computing-related I guess?
[21:00:09] <Brekkjern> indigo: In what way? There is a computer chip and it runs on electricity?
[21:01:13] <indigo> Hahah yes :P
[21:03:43] <indigo> Maybe I just have a lower bar due to all of the tech marketing posts that have been making their way on the site recently
[21:04:13] <indigo> I'd rather read about mind grenades than "how I used NewDevOpsTech to deploy wordpress"
[21:05:39] <jjuran> Grenades?  As in "mind blown"?
[21:05:53] <Brekkjern> jjuran: You tell me. That's what the post is called.
[21:06:03] <Brekkjern> jjuran: I was personally rather... whelmed... by it.
[21:06:08] <jjuran> lol
[21:07:14] <Brekkjern> Hmm. I wonder if one could make a decent voting system that has a neutral vote as well?
[21:08:52] <Brekkjern> Basically having a way of saying "this post is fine", "this post sucks and you should feel bad", and "this is fucking great!"
[21:08:58] <companion_cube> there are with "delegate" votes
[21:09:08] <companion_cube> but neutral? that's just voting blank :p
[21:09:25] <Brekkjern> Nah. It would be a signal that "this post belongs on the site"
[21:09:58] <companion_cube> oh interesting.
[21:11:09] <Brekkjern> I'm just not sure how to make an algorithm around it
[21:13:10] <companion_cube> maybe you need two axes
[21:13:15] <companion_cube> "relevant to lobsters"
[21:13:19] <companion_cube> and "cool"
[21:13:25] <companion_cube> (or popular/interesting/…)
[21:13:33] <companion_cube> neutral vote only boosts the first one
[21:15:12] <Brekkjern> Maybe
[21:19:41] *** Joins: spookymode (~imode@user/imode)
[21:22:28] <indigo> Maybe we should have a flag that is something like -0.25 (meh)
[21:22:43] <Brekkjern> Yeah. I've argued for that before
[21:22:58] <Brekkjern> There needs to be some sort of negative signal about post quality
[21:23:08] *** spookymode is now known as imode
[21:33:32] <indigo> Ever have one of those projects that's just obscenely complicated, and you know it's a poor fit for the product, but you can't convince anyone of that and have to keep doing it anyway? :P
[21:34:57] <imode> mood.
[21:41:55] <gwozniak> indeed
[21:42:10] <gwozniak> I feel that way about two major parts of our product
[21:49:28] <gwozniak> Well, one thing is a good fit, it's just obscenely complicated
[21:50:07] <gwozniak> The other is a business necessity that is obscenely complicated
[21:57:55] <imode> https://famicom.party very well written.

[22:48:43] <indigo> Hopefully I can get this finished in another couple of months... it's been over a year since I started and it keeps getting deprioritized
[23:00:45] <drakonis> dimadima: basically, id is hiring to remake the first quake game
[23:00:50] <drakonis> reboot/remake it

[23:19:53] <riv> they just released it
[23:20:04] <riv> i wasnt impressed
[23:20:17] <riv> its not really a remaster
[23:20:24] <riv> i dont know what to call it
[23:20:37] <riv> its like the improved SDL versions of these games you'd get by open source ppl way back
[23:20:43] <companion_cube> :D
[23:21:07] <companion_cube> well I saw it existed on switch now

[23:35:07] <riv> lol
[23:35:21] <riv> very shallow code reviews from someone who isn't familiar with the codebase
[23:35:51] <jjuran> Would a service that enlists humans to write parsers given a grammar be called M. Bison?
[23:36:00] <riv> we're talking "why aren't you using the auto-indenter?" "split this conditional onto multiple lines"
