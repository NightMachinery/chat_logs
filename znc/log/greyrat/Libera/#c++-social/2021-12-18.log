[00:09:50] <T`aZ> why would you buy uk food
[00:09:52] <T`aZ> or
[00:09:56] <T`aZ> why would you buy german food
[00:10:59] <Faux> Still planning to go to France even with the new rules, because the wife is insane.
[00:11:10] <Faux> At least we get to go on the traintunnel.
[00:11:36] <T`aZ> that's the fun part, enjoy it
[00:12:30] <Faux> "tunnel sur la mouche" as I call it when the wife is listening.
[00:18:43] <T`aZ> tunnel sous la mouche https://côtéjardin.com/WebRoot/LaPoste/Shops/box25283/54EE/100F/100D/7107/B7F4/0A0C/05E7/5B36/Cote_Jardin-Tunnel_accordeon_anti_insecte-2.jpg
[00:19:00] <Faux> I do not get it.
[00:20:19] <T`aZ> it's not funny though.
[00:20:59] <T`aZ> it's a protection against insect, so basically, flys are above that tunnel. I stupidely searched 'tunnel mouche' and it was the first result
[00:21:21] <Faux> Oh right.
[00:21:23] <Faux> Yes.
[00:24:54] <dukwon> Faux, are you even allowed in?
[00:25:49] <Renderwww> lets see how playing multiplayer vidya goes when drunk
[00:26:02] <Faux> dukwon: We're married. France seems to think marriage grants spouses rights like kids.
[00:26:34] <dukwon> i'm a little bit worried that france will interfere with my train from brussels to london
[00:26:41] <dukwon> but hopefully not
[00:26:44] <dukwon> it wouldn't make sense
[00:27:11] <dukwon> surely there can't be stricter rules to transit the country than to enter it
[01:11:03] <T`aZ> dont underestimate our/their stupid politicians
[01:20:49] <dukwon> i figure that for "admin" purposes, since i pass uk passport control in brussels, i never enter france
[01:20:55] <dukwon> even though the train stops in lille
[01:21:19] <dukwon> apparently there's a dedicated carriage for brussels to lille passengers
[01:21:27] <Faux> Interesting.
[01:21:40] <dukwon> we'll see what happens tomorrow though
[01:21:57] <dukwon> worst case they turn me around and i have to book a flight
[01:22:09] <Faux> I'm not travelling until Wednesday. Unfortunately, the government have revoked my vaccine certificate and I'm waiting for a new one.
