[02:26:16] <krismatrix> What do you guys do for testing of web code in production? I am using Mojo Test and have written several tests in the my_app/t/ directory. But the credentials for databases are different for test vs prod environemnet. It is entirely possible for things to break when I move the code to production. Do you guys write or modify your tests to function in production? what do you do?
[02:27:19] <buu> I don't run tests in production
[02:28:06] <krismatrix> hmm..you just accept that the code will work in production if it works in test?

[09:51:56] <vms14> I'd like the user to choose his own delimiters and save some variables in the db

[09:52:45] <vms14> buu: I want to make some sort of blogging platform
[09:52:53] <vms14> the user will just use template toolkit

[09:53:47] <buu> Yeah I'm just having flashbacks
[09:53:51] <vms14> but for example they could have some sort of macros, which would be tt variables with some text, so they can use them as predefined headers or something
[09:54:08] <vms14> and I can add features by adding functions to the tt
[09:54:12] <buu> Pretty sure tt2 allows actual macros
[09:54:23] <vms14> they could have some kind of back end stuff
