[01:17:27] <lispmacs[work]> hi, I'm new to Mutt. I'm confused about how to enable or open the sidebar, which is mentioned in the documentation.
[01:17:47] <lispmacs[work]> I am using an IMAP account that has multiple folders beside the INBOX.
[01:18:04] <lispmacs[work]> I guess they are called Mailboxes and not folders in Mutt

[01:20:07] <lispmacs[work]> I tried typing :sidebar-toggle-visible but get error "unknown command"

[01:29:55] <taman> lispmacs[work]: try CTRL-v ?
[01:31:52] <lispmacs[work]> I get error "Key is not bound"

[01:37:48] <kevin8t8> lispmacs[work]: but to invoke a function via : you can use exec or push
[01:38:03] <kevin8t8> lispmacs[work]: e.g  :exec sidebar-toggle-visible
[01:39:10] *** Joins: ajak (~ajak@gentoo/developer/ajak)
[01:40:15] <kevin8t8> lispmacs[work]: to make it more convenient, use the bind command to bind that function to a keypress
[01:40:59] <kevin8t8> lispmacs[work]: e.g. bind index \Cv sidebar-toggle-visible
[01:44:21] <kevin8t8> lispmacs[work]: \Cv means ctrl-v.  see the bind command in the manual for more details

[01:49:13] <lispmacs[work]> okay, that is working. Now it looks like I need to add the mailboxes to the sidebar (nothing is there)

[19:06:47] <wikan> back to using mutt ;)
[19:08:22] <wikan> do you know how to disable "drafting" while typing message in vim? I think mutt sends autosave parameter to vim, because it lags when i type. And I remember once I found about 20 drafts of my message.
[19:15:27] *** Quits: madage (~madage@user/madage) (Remote host closed the connection)

[19:18:50] <phinxy> + message is to you and you only
[19:19:16] <phinxy> another question, does mutt mark messages "read" as soon as theyre fetched with IMAP?  
[19:22:31] <phinxy> aha, adding the N flags and syncing makes it unread on the server.

[21:10:08] <kevin8t8> phinxy: by default Mutt doesn't do that (I'm assuming you're talking about when *read* a message), but $imap_peek can be turned off to mark them read when the full message is fetched.
[21:11:06] <kevin8t8> wikan: Mutt invokes vim as you specify if in $editor, it doesn't by default send any autosave parameters or such.
