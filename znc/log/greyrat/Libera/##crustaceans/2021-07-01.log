[00:03:46] <hoistbypetard> It somehow seems worse for an HVAC thing than for a cell phone
[00:06:40] <skyl4rk> a thermostat is a simple device that performs without problems year after year, but if we introduce features to it until it's on par with a cell phone, something that is high-tech with new generations coming out ever so often, and people are already accustomed to buying a new one every few years, we can sell a lot more thermostats

[20:11:02] <edm> it's just there as the topish reply
[20:11:25] <ngoldbaum> someone vouched it (yup, despite the slur)
[20:15:01] <edm> probably one of the few words that's universally not really used anywhere in the anglosphere
[20:15:17] <edm> infact maybe the only
[20:21:25] <pja> Even the use/mention distinction is not a defence, at least in the US for that word.
[20:22:09] <edm> well i think probably even here, unless it's like reporting what was said in court or whatever (and outside academic discussion)
[20:22:29] <edm> whereas other words that are slurs in say the US sometimes aren't so much in other bits of the english speaking world
[20:22:38] <pja> But this is at least on the mention, not the use side of the coin. But it’s still best neither mentioned nor used.
[20:22:49] <pja> /s/But//
[20:23:16] <edm> e.g. (will asterisk as mostly americans here i assume) c**t is a term of affection for your fellow australian in australia
[20:23:17] <skyl4rk> huh, I was wandering out in the kitchen and going to return with a question about use/mention distinction and it's already brought up
[20:23:48] <cb> i had the zoom client lock up my desktop
[20:23:55] <cb> i had to ssh in and kill zoom, THEN kill gnome-shell
[20:23:56] <pja> That word is hellbanned most english speaking places. Others are only hellbanned in the US, which leads to some entertaining culture clashes.
[20:24:11] <pja> cb: That’s impressive. Not had that happen!
[20:24:15] <cb> the great part is that you can log in and unwedge your desktop
[20:24:18] <cb> the bad news is you have to
[20:24:27] <edm> and i really want the uk to defend it's traditional and long-standing meatball dish - faggots - from the modern north american usage of the word. but that may be a lost cause
[20:24:30] <edm> but it seems a shame
[20:25:31] <edm> imagine how tiresome if pork-pie or fish-n-ships because some derogatory euphemism. we must fight back.
[20:25:58] <pja> nonce is another classic that works the other way.
[20:26:11] <pja> slur in the UK, anodyne cryptographic term in the US.
[20:26:48] <skyl4rk> edm, these days I can't tell if the expressed opinion is meant to be sarcastic or not
[20:27:24] <edm> the internet (well, ascii) doesn't help there either
[20:27:51] <ngoldbaum> how did cigarettes get the name of a meatball dish
[20:28:04] <edm> what do you mean?
[20:28:10] <edm> oh sorry with you
[20:28:12] <edm> being slow
[20:28:14] <edm> yes unsure
[20:28:46] <ngoldbaum> because the derogatory name comes from
[20:28:52] <ngoldbaum> cigarettes iirc
[20:28:55] <edm> ngoldbaum: is fags slang for cigarettes in the us too?
[20:28:59] <edm> i thought it was just here
[20:29:22] <edm> the whole 'can i bum a fag' HARHARHAR example in every guide to british english
[20:29:52] <ngoldbaum> i think it’s more the us understanding came from the same latin root
[20:30:00] <ngoldbaum> burning bundle of sticks
[20:30:22] <ngoldbaum> in the UK that came to be a cigarette, in the us it’s imagery of burning someone alive

[20:32:14] <edm> fwiw
[20:33:04] <edm> in the us sense they list hemingway using it in the 30s
[20:34:10] <edm> well anyway, language eh

[20:36:06] <edm> sort of wandered off piste but basically saying that any fluentish english speaker would probably know not to use some words regardless of where in the anglosphere they are
[20:36:22] <edm> e.g. a slightly edge-lord comment ngoldbaum pointed out on HN above
[20:36:38] <edm> but some other pretty rough words (in some countries) are different in others
[20:39:31] <Brekkjern>  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[20:40:48] <Brekkjern> It's honestly rather weird to have to have to moderate oneself because the local culture is so different to the one in the US
[20:41:43] <Brekkjern> The average Americans seem much more sensitive to bad language than much of the rest of the world
[20:42:02] <edm> well in this specific context anyway
[20:42:29] <edm> the whole master-slace thing seemed completely perverse from the other side of the atlantic but then there are probably things here that seem mad there
[20:42:38] <edm> it's like trying to explain water to a fish, right
[20:42:42] <edm> just different water
[20:44:21] <edm> but yes i agree it can be an overhead you can sometimes do without, but I rarely really have to think about it. beyond perhaps discussing cigarettes
[20:45:15] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[20:45:51] <edm> however when i saw a british person say 'I could care less' i know it will all be over
[20:45:56] <edm> when I see*
[20:46:02] <Brekkjern> Hehe
[20:46:17] <Brekkjern> And that was the first dose of the vaccine
[20:47:06] <pja> My kids are picking up a ton of Americanisms from YouTube.
[20:47:13] <dasm> edm: you reminded me: https://sb-cafetalk.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploaded-files/cafetalk-optimized-55d335019fed9-965508700-1439905025.png
[20:47:15] <pja> British English is dying people!
[20:47:57] <dasm> pja: i'm not native speaker, but the only exposure i had for English was AmEn
[20:47:58] <edm> all true
[20:48:33] <Brekkjern> Heh. "We're in a bit of a pickle" is also a phrase that means something completely different in the UK and the US
[20:48:35] <dasm> but there are jokes about Americans coming to the GB and being surprised, that people speak English there :)
[20:48:40] <edm> i have infact caused confusion by saying 'I think some of this could do with additional thought' in a project with the US
[20:48:55] <edm> for something that was a load of rubbish
[20:49:11] <edm> and my collaborators thought this was insufficient condemnation
[20:49:15] <Brekkjern> Lol
[20:49:19] <edm> whereas I thought it was about as damning as can be
[20:49:23] <Brekkjern> Same...
[20:49:57] <edm> so yes i suppose that's another example of having to keep the divided-by-a-common-language thing in mind
[20:51:07] <geoffwozniak> dasm: seems accurate
[20:51:53] <dasm> :)
[20:52:43] <geoffwozniak> Now, is that a British smiley? ;)
[20:52:52] <dasm> I'm not British :D

[21:02:17] <Brekkjern> I got a feeling that my arm will be fucked tomorrow...
[21:02:28] <Brekkjern> Already feeling it after 15 minutes.
[21:03:08] <geoffwozniak> Took about 12 hours for me to feel it.  It was sore for about 2 days
[21:03:50] <Brekkjern> It's not sore yet, but my arm feels weak
[21:05:09] <ngoldbaum> which shot?
[21:05:13] <ngoldbaum> sore arm def a thing
[21:05:34] <ngoldbaum> i felt kinda like i had a cold the day after both shots of pfizer
[21:05:50] <ngoldbaum> the sore arm lasted for like a week
[21:08:00] <Brekkjern> Pfizer
[21:08:03] <Brekkjern> First one
[21:12:28] <Brekkjern> It's not bad. Just feels a bit weird
[21:17:37] <bontaq> 1st shot was fine, 2nd shot got my arm sore for a couple days (moderna)
[21:17:38] <edm> i had a blast of night sweats about 48hrs after moderna

[22:05:16] <kirch> I had the same experience with Pfizer - 1st shot was nothing - 2nd shot my arm was sore, had some small muscle spasms probably because I was sore, for a couple days

[22:29:26] <geoffwozniak> ``The prevailing concept of UB in C is basically incompatible with mathematics and the design of C.''
[22:29:29] <geoffwozniak> Dude
[22:29:43] <geoffwozniak> The "design of C" was, at best, opportunistic for the time
[22:29:59] <gerikson> "mathematics" and "C" are terms that should not be used together
[22:30:00] <gerikson> imho
[22:30:07] <geoffwozniak> yes
[22:30:19] <companion_cube> well, some people use mathematics to formally analyse C
[22:30:24] <companion_cube> their resistance to pain is commendable
[22:30:39] <geoffwozniak> The rigour of mathematics was not something C was going for, based on how I read the original report
[22:31:46] <companion_cube> aren't compiler implementors also forced to be that level of rigorous?

[22:56:25] <hoistbypetard> Brekkjern: with swearing, as with many things, the US is full of weird contrasts. On one hand, you get perl clutching reviews of a film that targets 9 and 10 year old kids because one of the characters says “damn.” And I have heard with mine own ears someone who insisted on greeting folks by saying “heaven-o” because they disliked “hell-o”
[22:57:06] <Geekingfrog> heaven-o hoistbypetard
[22:57:21] <Geekingfrog> 🤗
[22:57:43] <hoistbypetard> And then there are those of us who, upon receiving a wound-up report from a preschool teacher that our 4 year-old cursed at school, ask about the context. And upon hearing it, say “well, he used the word correctly in context. why’d you scold him?”
[22:58:52] <geoffwozniak> heaven-o? That's a new one
[22:59:47] <geoffwozniak> My sister laughs at the thought of her son swearing at school.  She's very good at saying "goddammit", and he's good at imitating her :D

[23:00:34] <hoistbypetard> yeah. in my house it’d be a toss-up who the kids learn to swear from
[23:00:51] <hoistbypetard> we just want them to be aware of context when they do it
[23:02:05] <geoffwozniak> Yeah, that matters
[23:02:38] <geoffwozniak> I am mindful around my friend's kids about my language, but they are getting older now so it's less of a concern
[23:03:36] <geoffwozniak> If I had kids, I bet they'd be pretty good at it since I'd make a point of teaching them
[23:07:31] <hoistbypetard> :). It’s a point of pride that my kid knows more euphemisms for defecation than most of his peers
[23:08:41] <geoffwozniak> hahaha
