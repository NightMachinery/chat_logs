[00:27:38] <Koopz> hm, yes, having no more warning signs next to the network names sure feels better
[00:28:51] <Koopz> say is there any way to slim down my sqlite db?

[00:29:34] <xnaas> as for the sqlite, you can trim messages X day old, but requires TL restarts
[00:29:46] <xnaas> unless you're lucky, anyway, idk
[00:29:56] <Koopz> yeah because my logs folder is about 9 gigs
[00:30:35] <xnaas> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/wiki/Purging-SQLite-database-from-logs-older-than-X-days
[00:31:12] <xnaas> If you do that at the same exact time as thelounge logs anything (join, part, nick change, message, etc.), your TL will crash and restart.
[00:31:47] <xnaas> (isn't sql great? ü§™)
[00:32:24] <Activ8> speaking of sql I just had to repair my sql database, upgraded my base os and it did something mysql server wouldn't start
[00:32:39] <Koopz> should've used a *real* database üí©
[00:33:04] <Activ8> mysql is the only one I know - ish
[00:33:12] <xnaas> Someone submitted a PR quite some time ago to support databases other than sql, but idk whatever happened with that.

[02:46:55] <Activ8> the lounge did not crash

[02:47:38] <Activ8> I then wrote back to the backup copied database on the fly and it didn't crash

[11:51:16] <Activ8> I wonder why it works, I didn't think databases could be shared like this.  Anyway I won't mention anything about it again it
[11:51:22] <Activ8> it's a one off
[11:54:17] <bookworm> it works because sqlite uses locking. Meaning if a write is ongoing, nothing else can write at the same time. The only time TL would crash if there's some error handling missing. Usually you either block or get a EBUSY error
[11:54:36] <bookworm> multiple readers can co-exists, although they degrade the performance
[11:55:01] <bookworm> you do have a bit careful as some calls TL makes are blocking in a stop the world manner, meaning your server will hang
[11:55:14] <bookworm> eventually this will mess with your IRC connection as you'll be missing pongs

[20:21:36] <Activ8> i tested from npm as well and that install went fine

[20:24:29] <bookworm> yarn 1 is officially unsupported
[20:24:44] <bookworm> and yarn 2 is not an experiment I'd like to participate in ü§î

[21:28:51] <fnutt> bookworm: Yarn is being used because NPM sucked balls. xPaw was so irritated about NPM. 
[21:29:08] <fnutt> A few years ago we moved from NPM to Yarn. 
[21:29:45] <fnutt> I cannot remember the specifics, but‚Ä¶ in short - NPM sucks hard!
[21:29:49] <bookworm> yeah, but since then the yarn devs apparently ate some mushrooms they shouldn't have...
[21:30:29] <bookworm> afaik the general theme is that npm catched up?
[21:30:51] <fnutt> People struggled hard with NPM because some dependencies, if I remeber correctly. 
[21:31:13] <fnutt> I have noe clue about that. 
[21:31:33] <fnutt> I suggest you talk to xPaw before considering converting back to NPM.

[23:23:00] <MaxLeiter> thats a font problem, not TL 
[23:23:03] <Activ8> ah
[23:23:39] <Activ8> it's literally only that 1 emoji not valid
[23:23:58] <bookworm> yes
[23:24:06] <bookworm> has a few bugs though, with the highlighting
[23:24:20] <shadoozo> https://usercontent.twoopy.nl/753584cca5331c99/image.png <-- what's it supposed to look like
[23:24:46] <bookworm> nothing major, just an activity indicator that still needs to use the adjusted count... should probably make this a helper function instead
[23:24:54] <Activ8> alright I'm not bothered but it's just 1 that's not showing up, thought it was TL but it's fine

[23:27:40] <MaxLeiter> bookworm: you mean the badge next to chan name?
[23:28:00] <bookworm> no the thing on the network
[23:28:02] <bookworm> the dot
[23:28:37] <bookworm> least iirc... I was annoyed by it a while ago
[23:28:57] <bookworm> might've been a fluke
[23:29:23] <bookworm> ah, found it, on mobile on the hamburger icon
[23:29:37] <bookworm> on desktop too
[23:29:43] <MaxLeiter> ah gotcha, collapsed sidebar

[23:38:51] <MaxLeiter> johncs: if you don't see benefit in better-sqlite, don't continue the PR. Nachtalb had their reasons for it but I never dug too deep to see if it was worth it. Looking at bookworms and your conversation leads me to think it isn't necessary
