[16:10:02] <jan6> calAV is basically the ONLY non-commercial antivirus I know of, or at least only reputable one, lol
[16:10:12] <jan6> *clam
[16:10:30] <jan6> but obviously, it's only as good as it's database is
[16:11:29] <jan6> which is to say it will probably catch most things, but probably not ALL things, and not immediately after they're discovered, either
[16:12:38] <jan6> it's also the only open source antivirus I know of
[16:13:27] <jan6> it's mainly used for emails, but should work for plain files and stuff normally also

[17:31:29] <Zwolf12> killed the wifi / ethernet in the BIOS
[17:31:36] <Zwolf12> i'm no nuclear plant 
[17:31:43] <Zwolf12> it will be enough 
[17:35:48] <jan6> you generally want to run the antivirus on a machine that regularly has internet access though, so it's able to update the databases and stuff
