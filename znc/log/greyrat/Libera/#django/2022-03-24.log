[03:09:22] <Luhmanji> hello, i consumed several introduction videos regarding django. they all praised the ready to go admin features
[03:09:34] <Luhmanji> how is that part of the website protected?
[03:10:34] <FunkyBob> using the built in auth machinery
[03:10:42] <FunkyBob> password, permissions, the usual
[03:11:05] <FunkyBob> in the very early days, it was run on a different instance entirely - not part of t he regular site
[03:11:10] <FunkyBob> some places still do it like that
[03:11:32] <Luhmanji> so nobody could brute force my admin password for example?
[03:11:42] <FunkyBob> Luhmanji: I'm curious... have you done the official tutorial in the django docs? or only 3rd party videos?
[03:12:00] <FunkyBob> Luhmanji: well, no more than they can brute force any other password
[03:12:07] <Luhmanji> FunkyBob: only 3rd party so far
[03:12:36] <Luhmanji> FunkyBob: i had a feature like the tool fail2ban in mind
[03:12:50] <FunkyBob> certainly, you could wire fail2ban into your web server logs...
[03:13:00] <FunkyBob> or have rate limiting on your app

[19:34:20] <sixpiece> like I mean
[19:34:32] <sixpiece> it's just a terminal computer hooked up to the internet

[19:38:27] <sheepman[m]> it's very good and helped me a lot
[19:39:51] <SkinnyCapybara> I wonder if anyone can crack this one. I'm getting a 404 after clicking "confirm" on a delete form.
[19:39:52] <SkinnyCapybara> https://dpaste.org/WLsU
[19:40:01] <SkinnyCapybara> The error is in the paste
[19:40:57] <sheepman[m]> "The current path, library/organisms/ABC123/delete/post, didn’t match any of these." looks like nothing is handling /post
[19:41:10] <SkinnyCapybara> It used to work just fine and I had the grand idea of using a unique field as the pk. I think I got it working for the most part because the update and detail views work, so it's recognizing the pk. Delete brings up the "confirm?" and then goes to nowhere
[19:41:44] <SkinnyCapybara> I never had anything handling /post and it was working before, shouldn't it just redirect to the success_url after?
[19:42:38] <SkinnyCapybara> I don't know if me changing the model has anything to do with this error but that's what I've been playing with
[19:43:17] <sheepman[m]> Something odd is going on here to my eyes, let me look closer

[19:46:04] <SkinnyCapybara> Thanks for taking the time to look into it
[19:49:09] <stdedos> Without being a connoisseur, you are asking the form to do an `action="post"` (i.e. from wherever you are, append a post on the URL and go), as a GET request (`method` is missing)
[19:49:49] <stdedos> I am not sure how you will "re-call" the same URL (omit `action`?), but you should add the `method="delete"` and try again
[19:50:18] <SkinnyCapybara> THAT WAS IT!
[19:50:27] <stdedos> If Django is not "responding" to `HTTP/1.1 DELETE http://localhost:8000/library/organisms/ABC123/delete?csrfmiddlewaretoken=5JfXSMwUhywGuQP88H5hxZrKVho64bPOc5IOpDngZVsDH8g0KPS6TeYW6nstpgYJ` ... then make it so :-p
[19:51:01] <SkinnyCapybara> I changed it to post before reading your second comment and it is now working as expected
[19:51:08] <SkinnyCapybara> sorry, changed it to method, not action
[19:51:48] <stdedos> Okay, good
[19:51:59] <SkinnyCapybara> much appreciated! If you care about stackoverflow points I can give you the post I opened so you can suggest "change the template" and I check it as an answer lol
[19:52:20] <stdedos> Can't hurt, can it? :-p
[19:52:52] <stdedos> However, consider changing to `method="delete"` (and teaching django) to listen to it, instead of a GET query - it will make your API a little more semantic
[19:52:57] <SkinnyCapybara> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71601731/using-django-deleteview-and-getting-a-404-after-delete-confirmation/
[19:53:15] <SkinnyCapybara> Although someone posted that
[19:53:22] <SkinnyCapybara> and I didn't understand what they meant
[19:53:29] <SkinnyCapybara> sorry for being an idiot lol
[19:53:46] <SkinnyCapybara> I thought they meant that action is not the same as method, not that I should change the action for method
[19:53:51] <SkinnyCapybara> I didn't connect the dots

[22:46:10] <AnselmoCampanas> in an Heroku app hosted for free I have run "manage.py flush" and now I can't see permissions for creating user groups
[22:46:26] <AnselmoCampanas> any of you knows how can I regenerate the permissions?
