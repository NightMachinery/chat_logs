[12:04:25] <Activ8> AUCK FPPLE = why?
[12:26:59] <Snuupy> https://0bin.net/paste/3Qsmb-aM#gqTx7yQyja9hYnRrcUsxItzkq1GMfDvH98g1cv1jg6A
[12:27:55] <Activ8> is it really apple though or is there some code that can be added to sort it out
[12:28:03] <Snuupy> it's iOS safari
[12:28:04] <Snuupy> it's apple
[12:28:19] <Snuupy> no push notifs? thank apple
[12:29:12] <Activ8> that's probably a choice they have done so it's secure push.  They could probably implement web push but they obv againts it for some reason
[12:29:24] <Activ8> their platform their chouce
[12:29:26] <Activ8> choice*
[12:30:48] *** Quits: iXNyNe (~NyNe@user/nyne) (Quit: iXNyNe)
[12:31:35] <Activ8> that's like the lounge allowing every single commit and PR everyone makes and requests on here 
[12:51:00] <bookworm> that's not how web push works Activ8 
[12:51:14] <bookworm> the whole thing is authorized and authenticated
[12:51:45] <bookworm> apple just wants to keep its walled garden where they can enforce shit via their appstore policy
[12:51:49] <bookworm> that's the reason
[12:51:54] <Activ8> they have their reasons that's up to them
[12:52:10] <bookworm> it's still an anti consumer move
[12:52:35] <Activ8> anti consumer or not it's their decision though weather people like it or not lol
[12:53:05] <Activ8> I can understand peoples frustration though but meh
[12:53:16] <bookworm> sure I vote with my wallet
[12:53:24] <Activ8> on the flip side, I have push notifications off completely
[12:54:23] <Activ8> there's cheap android phones that work just as well that's a choice people make
[12:59:21] *** Joins: iXNyNe (~NyNe@user/nyne)
[13:00:22] <Activ8> android phones are just as bad though they do have their fair share of problems
[13:05:01] <bookworm> sure, but at least I can root it and i stall whatever the hell I want
[13:05:26] <bookworm> and have working web apps
[13:10:33] <Activ8> sure
