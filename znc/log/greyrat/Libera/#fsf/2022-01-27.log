[02:04:24] <irelativism> icedove is a rebrand of thunderbird to avoid the problematic mozzila trademark policy, a related issue happend with debian and firefox has well as with Rust language regarding the previous you can support the effort to end that policy in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/93157
[02:04:57] <isf> is the same with firefox and Abrowser

[03:13:14] <Kaiod> Hello everyone, good evening everyone!
[03:13:15] <Kaiod> I'm here to talk about something that's been bothering me a bit, and I think it's fair to be honest and open about it here. Some people (not only here, but in other places as well) have applied an extremist idea of 100% free software or "you desecrate malware", and this is extremely bad.
[03:13:15] <Kaiod> This radical thinking is exactly what makes someone not want to use free software, it's scary and it's not effective. When I talk around here about the process of learning and education, I say that it takes time, but it is effective, and what matters in the end is that everybody has their digital freedom.
[03:13:23] <Kaiod> Also, some people have used this thought, to attack the speech and opinion of others. Speaking as if "100% free software" is the obligation of every activist in the movement, or that you are a troll for treating this in a pedagogical way, and not in an extreme way.
[03:13:23] <Kaiod> This kind of thinking was clarified in the article "Saying No to unjust computing even once is help" by Richard Stallman
[03:13:23] <Kaiod> (https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/saying-no-even-once.html): "A misunderstanding is circulating that the GNU Project demands you run 100% free software, all the time. Anything less (90%?), and we will tell you to get lost-they say. Nothing could be further from the truth."
[03:13:23] <Kaiod> So, I ask you to have more patience when it comes to addressing and clarifying something in this channel, on the mailing lists, or anywhere else. Just because someone is on the FSF channel doesn't mean he or she is an I.T. professional and no one is obliged to know everything. Be patient and good educators when dealing with free software, because the intention is a free society, not just a few free people.

[03:15:56] <Noisytoot> Tox does not support multiple devices
[03:16:32] <DiffieHellman> Kaiod: I apply the extremist idea of 100% free software as it is a fact that proprietary software is malware. Still, sadly it's not posible to take the leap to 100% in a single step, so yes it needs to be done in many small steps, and sometimes certain computers sadly do need malicious firmware to operate/.

[03:23:49] <Kaiod> <DiffieHellman> "Kaio Duarte: I apply the..." <- The problem is not applying the extremist idea, if you can and are conscientious, you can apply it to yourself. And in the case, this is not extremist, you have made your way in free software and achieved your total freedom.
[03:23:49] <Kaiod> But it's not about you specifically, it's about how you teach and pass this on to people. Some people here do it in this extremist way, with people who sometimes have no idea what free software is. The idea is that everyone walks their own path and reaches their full freedom, in such a way that everyone can reach it together one day. 
[03:23:49] <Kaiod> It's not something extreme, or all or nothing newbie, take your pick. It is an educational process, and one learns and is renewed by it, applies it to one's life, and works freedom much further than in one's digital life. This is the point.

[07:06:38] <DiffieHellman> You can inspect with X-ray machines yes, but those are expensive and need to be correctly calibrated
[07:07:04] <labrador> You need
[07:07:09] <labrador> An electron microscope
[07:07:40] <DiffieHellman> Electron microscopes can see through the opaque black coating?
[07:07:59] <labrador> Well they can see through anything if it conducts
[07:08:46] <DiffieHellman> Hmm, sounds destructive.
[07:08:58] <notdaniel> DiffieHellman: you can etch away the epoxy package with nitric acid and it generally won't harm the ic
[07:09:10] <labrador> Those things are ridiculously expensive tho,and the few labs that have them won't let you use it

[07:13:49] <notdaniel> There's a cool trick for that I learned from a guy in this industry
[07:14:14] <DiffieHellman> You can grab one chip out of 100 and destructively inspect that, but that really doesn't prove that all the others are the same.
[07:14:53] <White_Flame> take a snapshot of the chip, destructively inspect it, then revert
[07:14:55] <DiffieHellman> After about 2 picked at random, I'd be pretty confident, but may as well go all the way.
[07:14:56] <notdaniel> You put a flip flop in series with every major line in the CPU (registers, MMU, ALU, etc) and wire them all together

[07:15:24] <notdaniel> So if you freeze the clock, you can use them like a giant shift register to read out the entire state

[07:16:13] <epony> your real problem ^
[07:16:16] <notdaniel> He said a lot of production CPUs actually have this feature but it's undocumented
[07:16:41] <epony> "The costs of creating new mask shop for 180 nm processes were estimated in 2005 as $40 million, and for 130 nm - more than $100 million.[2] In 2013 cost of new 28 nm mask shop was estimated at $110 – 140 millions.[3]"

[07:16:55] <notdaniel> I need to go to bed, I have to wake up in about 7 hours :/
[07:16:57] <epony> note, 180nm process is from 1996
[07:17:37] <epony> "As technology shrinks, the cost to mask shops increase and the product turn around time grow longer as well. The trend in this new decade is for manufacturing to migrate eastwards to reduce cost and lead times.

[07:35:03] <labrador> oh ok
[07:35:22] <epony> java's claim was portability
[07:35:26] <DiffieHellman> Same is probably true for lisp, but lisp is meant to be simple
[07:35:37] <epony> we have terminal saturation of POSIX and UNIX portability
[07:36:15] <epony> and a couple of commercial general failure reading your drive operating environments
[07:36:26] <labrador> But java be portable from windows to macs to linux
[07:36:31] <labrador> To anything that has a jvm
[07:36:38] <labrador> Much better than posix
[07:36:39] <DiffieHellman> Why are you naming an OS alongside a kernel?
[07:36:56] <labrador> ok DiffieHellman don't get triggered
[07:37:08] <DiffieHellman> C is far more portable than Java, compile it everywhere and run :3
[07:37:36] <epony> portability is ensured by standardised operating systems, runtimes are less efficient and create artificial scarcity and failure economically in the long run
[07:38:00] <labrador> No it isn't DiffieHellman,its so low level that you would need to change code
[07:38:05] <labrador> Java would run the same code
[07:38:10] <labrador> On both windows and linux
[07:38:17] <DiffieHellman> *GNU/Linux
[07:38:20] <epony> JVM is a runtime, not really portable either since its patent and commerce encumbered
[07:38:32] <Digit> was thinking that didnt sound right.  thanks labrador.
[07:38:41] <DiffieHellman> Not all Java libraries are on both Windows and GNU/Linux you know? Same as C.
[07:38:47] <labrador> epony, can you go and tell microsoft to standardize windows?
[07:38:50] <epony> it sucks in both performance and instrumentation (debugging and reliability)
[07:38:54] <labrador> no
[07:39:05] <epony> yes, JVM sucks and blows
[07:39:13] <DiffieHellman> You can write portable C, you can also write C that only works on one platform. 
[07:39:17] <epony> it's hugely wasteful
[07:39:32] <epony> right, or you can target your platforms at your own choice
[07:39:34] <labrador> DiffieHellman, no can't. Write using win32 api and get locked to windows
[07:39:42] <labrador> Write linux api and get locked to it
[07:39:57] <epony> porability is a scam when a captive midlayer runtime denies free access
[07:40:02] <labrador> You literally NEED different branches of your code
[07:40:07] <DiffieHellman> There's WINE which can handle the win32 API, but okay.
[07:40:11] <epony> and increases costs and reduces performance and relaibility
[07:40:17] <labrador> Well it isn't perfect DiffieHellman 
[07:40:27] <epony> you practically do not need no Java nothing
[07:40:30] <DiffieHellman> Just #ifdef the OS specific parts for cross platform compatibility, easy.
[07:40:40] <epony> Java is "quits"

[07:45:21] <epony> ..on POSIX, a set of APIs that mimic those of the commercial Unix operating system that enable high levels of interoperability for developers; a programmer would only need to write one set of code which then can be compiled on any system that has the same API, even if the computing architecture of the systems are different.

[08:46:35] <epony> damo22, yeah, it's a disaster ;-)
[08:46:46] <DiffieHellman> damo22: Yes, but it's for new AMD64 processors and not x86 ones (as no-one makes x86 anymore except for VIA etc)
[08:46:59] <damo22> ok
[08:47:17] <DiffieHellman> Pluton was ratified years ago, and TPM was one failed attempt.
[08:47:54] <DiffieHellman> Currently, Pluton is microsofts ultra-proprietary processor that's meant to be integrated on processors die.
[08:48:42] *** Joins: myzhang1029 (~Thunderbi@64.251.74.34)
[08:48:52] <DiffieHellman> AMD has gone ahead and integrated Pluton into their newest Ryzons and interfaced it with the PSP.
[08:49:15] <epony> you can always get processors without those features though
[08:49:27] <damo22> i have written a bunch of stuff for coreboot, but i gave up contributing because x86 firmware is now a wrapper for binary blobs... we need processors with specs from day 1
[08:49:30] <epony> the peformance series do not have these
[08:49:41] <DiffieHellman> The serial number thing and more is likely what they intend, but time will tell if they succeed.
[08:50:00] <epony> you have 0 chance of success on mobile devices and handhelds
[08:50:09] <epony> laptops are mobile appliances
[08:50:16] <DiffieHellman> Really, the only choice is to go for older processors that are libreboot compatible for the moment.
[08:50:29] <damo22> we cant keep using old crap forever
[08:50:40] <damo22> it will fizzle out on the second hand market
[08:50:47] <DiffieHellman> 3>old crap If it's a good processor, it'll keep on going.
[08:51:00] <DiffieHellman> There's RISC-V, but it looks like we need to wait 20 years for all the patents on making it run fast expire.
[08:51:05] <DiffieHellman> There'
[08:51:13] <damo22> not really, its wasteful because old processors chew electricity
[08:51:17] <DiffieHellman> s also certain ARM SoC, but TrustZone is a thing.
[08:51:22] <epony> yes, patents are 25-30 yrs in commercialisation

[08:51:48] <DiffieHellman> 140W isn't that much compared to air conditioning. If you're worried about wasting power, don't use air conditioning :3
[08:51:52] <epony> while it was programming specced from day 1
[08:51:57] <epony> so you have nothing to complain about
[08:52:13] <Digit> oh to unsecret a few patents.  
[08:52:32] <epony> heating homes with CPUs is more useful than simply heating
[08:52:50] <DiffieHellman> Unsecret a few patents?
[08:52:53] <epony> the data centre heats goes to waste
[08:53:15] <DiffieHellman> Patents are published, good luck learning anything from reading them though
[08:53:20] <epony> so GOOG does not produce cucumbers, it gives you the cucumber as a sucker audience with its spam computers
[08:53:24] <Digit> DiffieHellman: yes.   what part of that are you questioning?   which?   or, that some get secretted at all?
[08:53:35] <Digit> the latter presumably then.
[08:53:49] <epony> patents make no sense
[08:53:56] * Digit hard nods
[08:54:11] <Digit> mal-adaptive to an economic system that makes no sense.
[08:54:34] <epony> even if you have them, you still can't implement them unless you're large scale manufacturing with own R&D and in that case, you don't care about patents
[08:54:50] <epony> so the patents are just to keep monopolies able to sue small contenders and cancel them out
[08:54:57] <epony> it's exactly what Java was created for
[08:55:08] <epony> to provide disparity between big and small businesses
[08:55:32] <epony> so small ones can not compete with big ones for the high margin markets

[08:55:57] <Digit> yeah, when you put it like that, even calling it maladaptive sounds too generous.
[08:56:56] <epony> Java is about patents in classes and libraries, about proprietary language APIs and bytecode secrecy and code obfuscation for encrypted payloads to run as client applications.
[08:57:04] <epony> It's designed to reap huge profits.
[08:57:11] <epony> Oracle is such a company.
[08:58:22] <epony> It acquired the tech patents of Sun with its entire business and the Java and MySQL with it, and the office suite and the CPUs and instruction sets and copyrighted software produce.  Everything.
[08:58:45] <epony> plus the server productions
[08:59:08] <epony> Sun is NOT YOUR CHARITY, never was.
[08:59:44] <epony> it's produce was NEVER free, it was highly proprietary, expensive and very litigation aggressive

[09:11:55] <kompowiec> heh
[09:12:20] <kompowiec> it is generally professionally called extreme marketing iirc
[09:12:30] <Andrew> Most people (except the Chinese) when I talk to them are interested in Free Software
[09:12:44] <epony> we need less inflated attention-deficit hype rebranding and rename campaigns with false liberations of already free and open software components
[09:13:06] <Andrew> Just say free, skip the open source

[11:00:27] <kompowiec> labrador, purpose steganography it's a little bit different than encryption. The fact of exchanging keys in the case of encryption is explicit.
[11:00:38] <labrador> yes
[11:00:43] <labrador> but you need to hide it huh
[11:00:45] <labrador> Difficult
[11:01:37] <damo22> if someone works out how to factorize integers in polynomial time then the private key can be computed from the public key and all hell will break loose on the internet
[11:01:44] <kompowiec> currently you can create public key stego but it is not possible to exchange them with someone else (other than offline)

[14:17:55] <Andrew> Who do other things (bad ones) rather than promote free software
[14:18:29] <DiffieHellman> I guess "made" could be via convincing and not forcing.
[14:18:30] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: Spread the word, educate people, sure.  Refuse to use nonfree software to communicate, sure!  But don't force it onto people  
[14:18:53] <DiffieHellman> You actually can't force free software onto people now that I think about it.
[14:19:02] <Andrew> I mean, I don't agree with "exceeds the badness of forcing thing."
[14:19:09] <Andrew> The whole thing is about freedom and less conersion, yes
[14:19:36] <epony> seems like DiffieHellman wants to invade China and topple the government because they have a couple of WIN/DOS computers, Andrew prepare for boarding

[14:20:05] <Andrew> And "Red Flag 'Linux'", so... mostly not
[14:20:15] <Andrew> But I'd be happy if he wants to come and invade my school
[14:20:17] <DiffieHellman> Now that I think about it, it'll be forcing the chains to break, so not really anything to do with exceeding other than the chains grip.

[14:23:18] <epony> in your case it would have to be XJPing
[14:23:28] <Andrew> Um...
[14:23:34] <DiffieHellman> Yes?
[14:23:52] * Andrew does a WHOIS scan
[14:24:41] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: I also consider "digital chains" to be a chain/network of social norms of using proprietary software and how nonfree software is a tightly "integrated" "ecosystem"
[14:24:46] <epony> make it a "whowas"
[14:25:04] <DiffieHellman> Sure, expanding on the idea, that too.
[14:25:22] <DiffieHellman> It's "cool" to use proprietary software without thinking for some reason.
[14:25:40] <Andrew> Also, one problem with talking with Chinese people about free software:
[14:25:45] <Andrew> "I don't care about freedom"
[14:26:00] <Andrew> "You are an American bastard betraying our nation"
[14:26:03] <DiffieHellman> Conditioned to accept a lack of freedom from the start?
[14:26:18] <Andrew> Conditioned?
[14:26:22] <Andrew> How is that used here?
[14:26:48] <DiffieHellman> I guess conditioned, as in conditioned to accept proprietary software.
[14:27:08] <Andrew> Oh
[14:27:19] <DiffieHellman> Whoops, I keep using English words with 4 meanings.
[14:27:21] <Andrew> Most Chinese people accept others controlling their life
[14:27:26] <Andrew> in various aspects
[14:28:12] <Andrew> It's just weird to use the passive voice of the verb meaning of "conditoned", at least I'm not used to people talking like that
[14:28:29] <DiffieHellman> Hmm, the American goverment doesn't like free software, as it goes against the wishes of their corporate masters.
[14:29:03] <Andrew> The people here don't like freedom
[14:29:06] <irelativism> the only thing the American Gvornment members like is money ;)
[14:29:09] <irelativism> poor Assange
[14:29:21] * Andrew smells New Hampshire
[14:29:21] <DiffieHellman> People in my country hate freedom too.
[14:29:26] <Andrew>     
[14:30:21] <DiffieHellman> Is that a space?
[14:30:29] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: But people here say that, I believe in your case it's just that people don't find free software, but if you tell them about it, they won't call you something like what people here call me
[14:30:32] <Andrew> Yes, mistyped that
[14:31:42] <DiffieHellman> People here seem to take the side of the proprietary software company and start defending their "rights to get money" (even when I talk about freedom and not price).
[14:32:12] <DiffieHellman> n=1
[14:32:33] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: It should be noted that we ofc get less money than the proprietary software companies, but at least when we're getting money we aren't manipulating users to do so
[14:32:53] <DiffieHellman> Yup
[14:33:26] <Andrew> Personally, I don't agree with how society deals with money anyways.
[14:33:39] <labrador> Andrew, well i dont want politics here...but china and freedom are not really close
[14:33:46] <labrador> Mostly polar opposites
[14:33:49] <irelativism> DiffieHellman: Im not defending proprietary software in any shape or form. FOSS is not yet copatible in a pratical and icentivized way with current business models
[14:34:04] <Andrew> irelativism: Why?
[14:34:08] <DiffieHellman> irelativism: But you just did by using a name with "open source" in it?

[14:34:35] <DiffieHellman> Yes, money is a means to an end, not something you should throw everything else away for like society likes to.
[14:34:48] <irelativism> like the one of self-sustaing collectives
[14:34:57] <irelativism> DiffieHellman: OSS != FOSS
[14:35:02] <DiffieHellman> Free software is very profitable for a number of businesses that I know off.
[14:35:05] <irelativism> free software is ambigious
[14:35:20] <irelativism> "Free software is very profitable for a number of businesses that I know off." indeed
[14:35:32] <irelativism> the icentive is on the wrong side though
[14:35:32] <Andrew> I do use the term open-source, but in rare cases.  It's when there's little to do with freedom but has a lot to do with developing less buggy software
[14:35:43] <DiffieHellman> "open source" and slapping free in front of it implies gratis, source available software
[14:35:45] <Andrew> But I only used that a few times, because most times freedom is the issue.
[14:35:53] <irelativism> the icentive in such business models are not to use FOSS
[14:35:55] <DiffieHellman> I never use the "open source" term, other than to put it down
[14:36:00] <irelativism> but to use proprietary code
[14:36:00] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: I don't see how that implication works though
[14:36:25] <Andrew> I do say "free (libre)" when I'm talking to people
[14:36:43] <irelativism> "implies gratis, source available software" that is entirely your assumption on the matter
[14:36:50] <DiffieHellman> Andrew: A few business's can misuse the "FOSS" term on their proprietary software, but not one has been able to misuse free software
[14:37:03] <Andrew> Hmm, seems true
[14:37:04] <irelativism> libre is not commonly used in english language
[14:37:16] <Andrew> irelativism: Yes, that's why it's in \paren's
[14:37:17] <irelativism> so people dont know what you are talking about
[14:37:21] <irelativism> FLOSS sounds stupid
[14:37:31] <irelativism> FOSS the best compromise
[14:37:36] <irelativism> is simple
[14:37:44] <irelativism> respectfull
[14:37:44] <Andrew> Open Source doesn't make sense when I talk to normal users.
[14:37:45] <DiffieHellman> That's why you should explain what you mean by libre software - people will still learn.
[14:37:58] <DiffieHellman> I'm not here to compromise, I'm hear to wipe out the enemy on all fronts.
[14:38:03] <DiffieHellman> *here
[14:38:03] <irelativism> and understandable
[14:38:08] <irelativism> the ideology that OpenSource defends
[14:38:13] <irelativism> is cancer
[14:38:18] <irelativism> but the terms is usefull
[14:38:29] <irelativism> given it explains it rather simply
[14:38:35] <irelativism> so that is why the use of FOSS
[14:38:39] <DiffieHellman> So why do you support the cancerous ideology by using a term with "open source" in it's name
[14:38:53] <irelativism> anyway each person should express themselves has they wish
[14:38:56] *** Quits: fef (~thedawn@user/thedawn) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:39:06] <irelativism> the conversation got derailed on a stupid topic
[14:39:16] <Andrew> It may make sense to say FOSS to a manager of a company who doesn't care about user freedom and doesn't listen to me explaining that to per, but wants better quality soyftware
[14:39:23] <irelativism> DiffieHellman: again OSS!=FOSS
[14:39:41] <DiffieHellman> Andrew: Sure, but I have no interest in pandering to managers myself.
[14:39:43] <Andrew> irelativism: How does it explain freedom clearly?
[14:39:51] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: hehe I don't either, just an example
[14:39:55] <irelativism> Andrew: terms need to be atained, so using the same term every time helps
[14:40:05] <DiffieHellman> If the manager wants a benifit, the manager can come and get it under the license terms
[14:40:08] <irelativism> fragmentation doesnt help in movements
[14:40:14] <Andrew> irelativism: Then use "Free Software"?
[14:40:28] <DiffieHellman> The free software movement is not fragmented and stands together strong.
[14:40:43] <DiffieHellman> "open source" is an offshoot of people without strong enough ideals.
[14:40:55] <irelativism> Free software is ambigious, and shows the lack of awareness of presentation from some of the early GNU project members
[14:41:10] <irelativism> DiffieHellman: again OSS!=FOSS
[14:41:17] <Andrew> Then "software that respects the freedom of users"
[14:41:24] <irelativism> dont make me repite myself again please
[14:41:28] <Andrew> irelativism: Then why combine them?
[14:41:43] <irelativism> Then "software that respects the freedom of users" by the time you get to "users"
[14:41:49] <irelativism> people already left
[14:41:58] <DiffieHellman> Free software has 2 meanings, but you can explain which one you mean and the people who you are talking to and they won't make the same mistake.
[14:42:08] <irelativism> FOSS is simple and cognitively understandable
[14:42:16] <irelativism> anyway this discussion is pointless
[14:42:16] <DiffieHellman> "free and open source" has many, many meanings, and most are incorrect
[14:42:32] <Andrew> And it leads to misunderstandings that we're a development stragegy

[14:57:11] <Andrew> epony: That is, if you're not in *some region often featured in news lately*
[14:57:22] <irelativism> My point is we need business models that icentivize FOSS not the oposite, so far the business models that are compatible with FOSS dont do the later
[14:57:29] <DiffieHellman> You can get lots of money from restricting the user in the right way, but that doesn't mean doing that is the right thing to do.

[14:58:01] <DiffieHellman> Free software is incentivized massively already, as it actually works, you just need to accept a few simple requirements.
[14:58:02] <irelativism> corect that is why the use for the word icentivize

[14:58:27] <damo22> the biggest problem we face today in tech is that big companies are harvesting every piece of data from our phones and selling predictions on user behaviour, and also manipulating users to make decisions they wouldnt usually make

[14:58:56] <DiffieHellman> Well, it's working fine so far, so I don't see any need to change it.
[14:59:24] <irelativism> that is true damo22 but the problem itslef is not really the company but the business model that is incentivizing such behaviou

[17:48:25] <duncan-nz> Protonmail also does IMAP.
[17:48:29] <isf> only 
[17:48:31] <DiffieHellman> duncan-nz: There's no particular technology, but there's a bunch of unjust email blocking services
[17:48:33] <isf> if you pay
[17:48:37] <Andrew> Not by default, but I heard it's an okay provider
[17:48:39] <isf> only if you pay duncan-nz
[17:48:43] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: Agreed
[17:48:56] <duncan-nz> Andrew: so its just a blacklist some providers use?
[17:48:57] <DiffieHellman> duncan-nz: You still need to sign up with nonfree JavaScript, plus you need to run a translating client
[17:49:02] <isf> tutanota for example, block directly the messages from airmail
[17:49:06] <gnoo> how much spam do people get? i've only gotten two since 3 years 
[17:49:11] <Andrew> duncan-nz: More like dmarc+spf+dkim+blacklist
[17:49:18] <Andrew> gnoo: I've gotten none in a year
[17:49:20] <isf> and a lot of gmail accounts block directly the airmail mails
[17:49:22] <DiffieHellman> duncan-nz: Use spamassasin if you want to block spam.
[17:49:23] <duncan-nz> Isn't there also a system for checking the your email actually comes from the domain shown?

[23:24:50] <ewwegweg> GNUHacker which key?
[23:26:16] <zleap> ewwegweg, I am using thunbderbird and the built in Opengpg thing, how do I extract the fingerprint which IIRC is the bit I need at keysigning events?
[23:26:29] <zleap> when we used enigmail and normal gpg this was easier
[23:27:39] <GNUHacker> with emacs as mail client this is easier
[23:28:01] <zleap> i am using thunderbird
[23:34:48] <leah> i have been summoned
[23:35:59] <leah> 18:43 <vitali64> there's a BIG thing : https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/issues/278
[23:36:02] <leah> indeed, this is excellent news
[23:36:06] <leah> i will add this to my notes
