[00:35:13] <gregf> I have dhcp setup and that works for getting the preseed.cfg from the the bootloader. Problem is when the install finishes I have to have a static ip on the box so I can port forward ssh into the network long story. To work around this I'm just doing a late command right now to change /etc/network/interfaces so when it reboots it has the IP I need it to have. I would really rather do this via
[00:35:15] <gregf> preseed.cfg properly though.

[11:51:57] <kylese> Greetings. For installing a self-signed S/MIME certificate, adding an additional personal authority to Evolution Mail (first time) seems to request a ("my") NSS db password. According to my password manager I cannot remember to set such a pass phrase in the past. There are '~/.pki/{cert9.db,key4.db,pkcs11.txt}', because I already use the Gnome Key Ring for ssh and PGP keys. (The integration of the authority and the personal S/MIME 
[11:51:57] <kylese> certificate has already been accomplished in Thunderbird.) What options do i have strategically to achieve the same in Evolution? Many thanks in advance. [Engilsh:=foreign language]

[13:27:47] <ratrace> killall does process groups. afaik, could be wrong, but afaik kill always took just one integer pid
[13:28:35] <dorp> PMT: Signal the processes with the same PGID
[13:28:37] <PMT> I believe kill can take arbitrarily many pids, but they are pids.
[13:28:49] <PMT> dorp: what platform uses that syntax?
[13:29:05] <ratrace> if it does, that's not properly documented :)
[13:29:13] <PMT> ratrace:        kill [options] <pid> [...]
[13:29:31] <ratrace> that's /usr/bin/kill
[13:29:48] <PMT> yes, and since we were also discussing killall, which is not a builtin, it seemed relevant.
[13:29:52] <ratrace> the usage form of the shell builtin doesn't suggest [...]
[13:30:22] <PMT> The shell builtin appears to also happily take multiple pids, and even says so in the usage.

[13:32:28] <ratrace> so the negative pid as pgroup would apply to kill(1) according to the manpage. guess the shell builtin is just..... why the eff does shell even have those. Where's the friggin UnixWay(tm) of do one thing well...
[13:32:33] <PMT> As ratrace already noted, "killall" or "pkill" can do pgids.
[13:33:04] <ratrace> and kill(1), just saw it in the manpage, if you spec negative integer it's assmed to be pgroup
[13:33:06] <PMT> Ah, so it does, I overlooked that line when I read the man page the first time.
[13:33:13] <PMT> I just saw the one about -1 being special.
[13:33:52] <PMT> So I suppose "if you want pgids, don't use kill, unless you're sure it's not dash" 
[13:33:57] <PMT> (Or "file a bug against dash")
[13:34:06] <ratrace> (or use full path to kill(1))

[20:24:58] <amacater> Yes - and no. The update is on the mirrors: so if you're already running 10.9 an apt-get update will move you to 10.10. Installer images are being tested right now - I'm on the team doing it - so if you wanted to install from new, we can't guarantee it. Main release always happens slightly before the media release.
[20:25:46] <RhinosF1> amacater: I scheduled our upgrade window for this evening
[20:26:42] <amacater> If you have unattended upgrades or whatever it's called, you will effectively already be receiving the updates :)
[20:27:40] <amacater> Effectively, there's not much difference - but you might want to run a full upgrade / dist-upgrade to make sure.

[22:38:35] <PMT> How are you distinguishing between "a daemon that spawns and stops as used" and "something that is called as needed"?
[22:39:17] <sney> I can see the logic, you pop the daemon into memory during the apt run, and then apt/dpkg talks to it multiple times during that process. probably a little quicker than running the whole subprocess every time 
[22:39:19] <RhinosF1> Will read

[22:44:41] <sney> that's what the mail says, so that's the plan currently. who knows what the future holds. subscribe to d-d-a for any updates.

[22:47:35] <Posterdati> is this huge update the last for 10?
[22:48:42] *** Joins: jhutchins (~jonathan@136.34.212.57)
[22:48:43] <sney> Posterdati: likely the last before bullseye is released, it's possible for there to be another point release for oldstable. 
[22:48:50] <sney> stretch had one a little while after buster was released 
[22:49:03] <Posterdati> ok
[22:49:20] <Posterdati> will bullseye better than buster? What about systemd?

[22:50:52] <amacater> sney - there's likely to be a point relese more or less once it drops off oldstable too to wrap up any security issues
[22:50:57] *** Joins: Enissay (~Enissay@user/enissay)
[22:50:58] <sney> bullseye's systemd is 247.3-5, oddly not listed on that page
