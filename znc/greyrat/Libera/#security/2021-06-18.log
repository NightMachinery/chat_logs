[04:40:52] <flyback> https://geneticfractals.org/2020/05/17/analog-4-bit-random-number-generator/
[04:41:00] <flyback> so this seems cool for small mcu's to generate some rng
[04:41:32] <flyback> I think he's u sing resistor shot noise
[04:42:01] <flyback> nope im wrong
[04:42:29] * flyback goes to reinstall his freenas cause he did some options wrong
[04:42:46] <flyback> still excited about this anyways finally having a nice place to collect all my project data and make backups
[04:43:47] <flyback> I can finally dump boxes of old hard drives
[04:45:38] <lacroix> good evening all
[04:46:00] <ilikeyou> evenin'
[04:46:36] <ilikeyou> appears to be some security operative action tonight
[04:46:53] <flyback> is so weird
[04:47:04] <flyback> having your own nas and being able to have just everything all together at once
[04:47:12] <flyback> I dunno how to describe it
[04:47:15] <lacroix> heya ilikeyou :)
[04:48:17] <flyback> I still think they should have a security contest for coding on a cpu with no mmu
[04:48:37] <flyback> just to see what the longest mitigation time could be
[04:48:49] <flyback> of couse it's not possible to be 100% secure I get it

[21:44:12] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> best you can do is learn what normal is and then figure out normal is enough to pop the entire network regardless its all pretty laughable

[21:45:24] <bewees> i wonder if i will have to spent countless hours on anaylzing the traffic myself or if at some point be able to manage moderately with custom rules, so i dont get spammed with alerts but only get actually suspcious traffic once in a while

[21:50:52] <Retr0id> *in theory* ML models can pick up on previously-unknown threats that don't yet have IOCs
[21:51:10] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> you either know what the network should be doing and still might not win or your totally fucked imo
[21:51:31] <Retr0id> basically no firewall can defend against someone who is deliberately trying to circumvent it
[21:51:38] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> theres talks already out on small incremental changes to norm to avoid detection i watched one the other day
[21:52:12] <TimMc> Establishing a baseline and then alerting for anomalies (traffic pattern, volume (by time of day), protocols) can certainly detect certain kinds of novel attacks.
[21:52:33] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> some people still cant even alert on out of hours staff authentication :)
