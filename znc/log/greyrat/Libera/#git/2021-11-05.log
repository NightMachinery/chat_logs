[00:33:32] <Linkandzelda> if I create a repo which is designed to serve as a project template, and then I create a bunch of projects with it, then update the repo template. is it as simple as merging from the template remote origin to bring the updated template files into the projects (barring any conflicts where tempate files were totally overwritten etc)? i'm thinking more in terms of build systems/testing systems

[01:13:20] <cvmn> i wonder if there is a better approach so tht i can sync with android?
[01:13:29] <rawtaz> why not. you can use a gantt chart or some other means. perhaps a kanban board.
[01:13:48] <rawtaz> ther's a webapp (you can run it stand-alone if you want) thats named personal kanban board, its really nice
[01:14:09] <rawtaz> theres tons of services for this stuff online if you want to use something like that
[01:14:24] <rawtaz> the tools are plenty, what it boils down to is knowing how much micromanaging you want to do :)
[01:15:09] <cvmn> how about just google tasks?
[01:15:34] <rawtaz> yeah wh ynot
[01:15:48] <rawtaz> personally i wouldnt put stuff with google, but if thats how you roll why not
[01:16:11] <cvmn> are you ungooged?
[01:16:13] <rawtaz> i think it makes sense to start small and keep it simple. you will learn with time what you think that you need to change or so with your planning

[03:40:28] <rawtaz> are you being serious now?
[03:40:38] <mackerman> To actually reduce the size, you need to edit history.   https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history
[03:40:54] <rawtaz> i mean it, are you seriously thinking that github is a version control protocol?

[04:21:25] <nicode> howdy folks, had a very strange issue happen today and am not sure how to figure out HOW it happened. basically I have feature branches where devs work on stuff, a QA branch where we push feature branches in and then deploy that to a QA server, then when the code is ready for production, we merge QA into production. The weird thing that happened today is that I had a fix ready, pushed it to QA
[04:21:25] *** Joins: ano (~ano@user/ano)
[04:21:27] <nicode> (deployed and tested worked fine). Then I merged QA to production and the change didn't merge as expected (there was 1 remove line and 3 additions in my original merge to QA but in my merge to production only the 3 additions went through.
[04:22:22] *** Joins: akimbo (~akimbo@customer-145-40-27-9.stosn.net)
[04:23:29] <nicode> of course I didn't notice that the merge didn't happen as expected as I was looking at green and red lines (bitbucket) so didn't notice the missing removal 'till it was obvious something fishy was going on.

[04:29:54] <rawtaz> nicode: whats the question? or are you just sharing :)
[04:30:25] <nicode> I'm wondering how that could happen.
[04:30:52] <nicode> I am looking at commit logs and now I can see where the issue happened but I'm trying to figure out how to have it not happen again.
[04:31:25] <nicode> rawtaz ^^
[04:32:08] <nicode> rawtaz, also not sure if there's a way to get into deeper detail to see how decisions were made to merge the file the way it was merged (missing the line removal).

[04:37:03] <rawtaz> i suppose you can always try to reproduce the repo by rewinding things. in a copy of it of course

[11:07:28] <mdk> But in the end if it takes gigabytes it's probably because you tried to version big binary files?

[14:06:59] <thblt> I want to checkout a branch that exists on the remote, and somehow git doesn't want. I've tried `git fetch`, `git fetch --all`, `git fetch origin emacs-28`, but `git checkout emacs-28` or `git checkout origin/emacs-28` fail with "error: pathspec 'emacs-28' did not match any file(s) known to git", and the branch doesn't appear in `git branch --all`
[14:08:12] <thblt> Notice that `git fetch origin emacs-28` succeeds, but the branch still isn't there.

[14:09:59] <Timvde> rapha: what do you mean by "only the last commit"?
[14:10:12] <thblt> Wait, it was .git/config that had a fetch map restricted to master for some reason.
[14:10:23] <Timvde> A pointer to the commit parent is included in the commit itself, if it has another parent, it's not the same commit
[14:10:46] <thblt> Sorry for rubberducking.
[14:10:48] <Timvde> So do you want to take the changes made in that commit, cherry-pick them on the main branch, and push *that*?
[14:12:42] *** Joins: masber (~masber@vpn-89.cscs.ch)
[14:16:51] <Samian> anyone know how to install git on centos?
[14:16:57] <Samian> I don't have access to dnf or yum
[14:17:01] <Samian> I can use wget and conda

[14:21:57] <thblt> Samian: You'll probably need to install all dependencies by hand, build them (with `make` and the GNU autotools), and proceed until you have a working git installation.  Unless you can somehow download binaries, maybe. Or build them on a machine you have better access rights.
[14:22:43] <Samian> why isn't there an sh file I can wget?
[14:22:47] <Samian> that's how I installed conda
[14:23:12] <thblt> Why should there be?
[14:23:29] <thblt> But maybe you can install with conda, just try it.
[14:23:33] <Samian> because it's a convenient way to download and install stuff
[14:24:32] <thblt> The convenient way is with package managers.  sh installers are messy.
[14:24:49] <thblt> That being said, conda doc suggests you can do `conda install -c conda-forge git `

[21:00:06] * imMute generally branches off the main development to create "release" branches where stuff like version numbers are updated and possible last-minute bug fixes are done, then tag the commit that gets released.
[21:00:27] <imMute> and then merge that branch back into master if there were bugfixes, or cherry-pick those onto master, either one works.

[21:06:06] <Swahili> imMute: thanks, makes sense! My first attempt worked out quite well. I think my initial question about starting with an orphan branch did not make sense, as I do indeed need to have a common history. So worked well. Unless someone tells me otherwise?
[21:06:45] <Swahili> the difference is that in the main, I have the commits where the tag/release point to, plus for this case the commit for the release that includes the changelogs
[21:07:14] <dob1> imMute, it is not required to add it to the base git repo dir, right?
[21:07:28] <dob1> I can add in a sub dir too?

[22:39:30] <jwr> This might be a github question and not necessarily a git question, but... i can see a pull request which was merged into the main branch of a repository, and presumably was released in a subsequent release tag. how can i correlate which release tag this PR was released in?

[23:23:43] <junon> I have a number of submodules that constitute a much larger repository, and many of them respectively share the same submodule (a 'common' directory for frequently used org-wide scripts, etc). Given that any of the repositories can be checked out individually, or used in a modular fashion, only the top level (root) repository actually needs the common submodule checked out in order for them to function (the scripts account for this already). Is there a way to
[23:23:43] <junon> properly represent this with .gitmodules configuration, so that none of the submodules check the common submodule out for themselves but still recurse into all other submodules? I tried a combination of submodule.X.active and submodule.active but `git submodule update --init --recursive` seems to ignore all config directives.
[23:24:38] <junon> If this is a question better left for the mailing list, just let me know. :)

[23:45:41] <Welp> Is there any way to get a diff that only lists changes that still exist in the current code? So if I have something like 'git diff "<some commit>^..<some commit>"' which says two lines were added, but one of those lines was removed in a subsequent commit, I only want the line that wasn't removed.
