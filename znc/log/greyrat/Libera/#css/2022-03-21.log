[00:14:15] <Rainier> DPA, yeah I was going to say the markup in the fiddle was invalid. If an element is positioned absolutely and the parent is relative, then you can contain it that way. (It doesn't have to be relative, just not the default value of "static".)
[00:27:15] <DPA> I can't do this in this case, because the element containing the pseudo element I want to position relative to the parent already have a non-static position. I think I'll just make the boxes take the whole width for now.

[01:24:39] <Rainier> DPA, oh, I have a fix for that then. :) I think.
[01:25:23] <Rainier> So there's a trick which is that position: fixed; can be trapped by something other than the viewport. Iirc it requires setting a transform: translate(0,0,0); (the third coordinate is important, iirc, but you can try with just x/y only). Then you set the item you want to "escape" to the parent with position: fixed;
[01:26:13] <Rainier> So tl;dr: try setting transform: translate(0,0,0); on the parent you want to be relative to, and position: fixed; on the item you want to be relative.

[01:40:44] <jargon> I don't understand the error.
[01:41:14] <jargon> And yes, I already clicked thru to read the validator's provision.
[01:41:23] <Rainier> Uuuuh, well, that markup is pretty bad even though much of it does pass the validator. I would use a stylesheet over inline CSS and I would avoid absolutely positioning everything. CSS has ways of doing layouts like that without abspos.
[01:41:59] <jargon> I know this, I am trying to get rid of the errors first.
[01:42:04] <Rainier> As to #2-4, it's suggesting you have an anchor that's already open when it encountered the start of another one. You need to find the unclosed anchor and add the appropriate end tag.
[01:42:33] <Rainier> Yeah, but fixing the markup to move stuff out would make it more clear where the errors are or maybe even remove them as you tidy up.
[01:43:25] <Rainier> My guess is it's complaining about the lack of an </a> after Dungeon, right where you have "Dungeon<br><br>"
[01:43:27] <jargon> https://imgur.com/uP8slF7
[01:46:25] <Rainier> That's different markup though. The page you gave it ends in &sect=ladders which doesn't have the tables-for-layout junk, so you're unlikely to find the missing </a> spot there, since it's entirely different.
[01:47:18] <Rainier> The missing <a/> should be before or after the <br><br> that comes after the word Dungeon on http://puzzlum.org/repo/?prj=Dungeon&sect=ladders

[02:04:19] <jargon> Should I use <a/> or </a> or <a />
[02:05:37] <Rainier> Oh, sorry, I typo'd. To close an anchor you should use </a>.
[02:05:48] <Rainier> <a/> would be a self-closing anchor which for various reasons is weird.
[02:07:27] <jargon> :P
[02:08:02] <Rainier> Also there's no difference between <a/> and <a /> They're the same. The space doesn't matter here.

[02:21:25] <Rainier> jargon, as before, the first error is suggesting that you didn't properly terminate an anchor, so it included more contents than it should have that aren't allowed to be children of an anchor. At least according to the validator.
[02:22:20] <Rainier> That is why errors 2-4 indicate "invalid nesting" since you're already inside of an anchor, in theory. (Browsers will have already auto-terminated the anchor, but that's why the validator is yelling at you because you should fix it even if the standard behavior does what you want since it could do something you don't want later if you make more changes.)

[17:38:10] <grapheti> What's the best (most efficient and most performance driven) layout grid system?
[17:44:23] <hassoon> what ?
[17:44:37] <hassoon> grid system is just grid system
[17:44:55] <hassoon> you can use it or opt for flex layout or possibly your own layout
[17:45:32] <hassoon> never heard of different grid systems
[17:46:38] <grapheti> I guess I mean the least expensive to render
[17:46:55] <grapheti> or does it matter?
[17:48:35] <hassoon> ya grid is just grid
[17:48:55] <hassoon> you just need to know how to use it the right way
[17:51:01] <grapheti> gotcha

[20:54:47] <ashnur> hi, have a question, how would you implement columns with little boxes where boxes are next to each other and if there is only a tiny bit of text in the center, the text is centered, but if either of the boxes has lots of text, the boxes in the same row will start their text at the same height, even if they themselves have little text

[22:02:45] <ashnur> it's like, one box should know the content of the other so that the text can be in the same first row
[22:03:07] <ashnur> but the first row has to be centered according to itself
