[19:35:38] <Security> hi there.. can someone help me how to install  thelounge im new on irc i have  no idea :(
[19:36:10] <bookworm> Security: sure, what did you try? What did you not understand from our docs?
[19:36:53] <Security> i  will be honest with you i read few things but not sure how  u install them on putty :(
[19:37:32] <bookworm> putty is just an ssh client, not something you install stuff on
[19:37:44] <bookworm> ssh is just a fancy protocol to talk to some other machine
[19:38:04] <Security> ok
[19:39:55] <Security> $ sudo commands is it used for vps if im not wrong
[19:40:07] <Security> i own irc shell no vps
[19:40:39] <bookworm> it's used for Linux like operating systems that have the sudo commands installed, which is most of them
[19:40:48] <Security> ok
[19:40:54] <bookworm> you're irc shell very likely doesn't give you permissions to it
[19:40:59] <bookworm> your*
[19:41:16] <Security> tru i think only vps lets  u do this
[19:41:36] <bookworm> a VPS just means "virtual private server", it isn't a "thing" as such
[19:41:46] <bookworm> just fancy language for "some server under my control"
[19:42:16] <bookworm> meaning, "some computer that runs an OS, generally Linux"
[19:42:27] <Security> ok
[19:42:36] <bookworm> can be BSD or Windows server too if you feel masochistic
[19:44:13] <Security>  ok i see seems difficult for me :D
[19:44:13] <bookworm> do you have access to a home directory, where you can store files and such?
[19:44:39] <Security> yes
[19:44:42] <bookworm> do you have shell acecss, meaning you can run commands say from bash?
[19:44:47] <Security> yes
[19:44:56] <bookworm> do you have yarn installed?
[19:45:32] <bookworm> just type yarn --version, if that errors out you don't
[19:45:43] <bookworm> if so, try the same with npm --version
[19:46:07] <bookworm> if neither of those work, you need to talk to your shell provider if they can give you either of those
[19:46:45] <Security> sec le me log in

[19:47:42] <Security> -bash: yarn: command not found

[19:49:03] <bookworm> talk to your provider, what you need is node + some node package manager in order to install and run the lounge
[19:49:33] <Security> ive just  send them an email
[19:49:35] <Security> thank you

[19:51:10] <Security> they asked me for 25$ for them to install it huh noway i rather change provider :D
[19:51:44] <bookworm> you can get a free VPS with google if you don't mind the privacy implication or a VPS for less than 5 bucks a month
[19:51:48] <bookworm> so I'd go with those
[19:52:11] <bookworm> oracle has a free tier VPS as well for what it's worth
[19:52:16] <Security> i pay 8$ month for this irc shell
[19:52:21] <bookworm> ...
[19:52:26] <bookworm> yeah, don't
[19:52:41] <bookworm> in any case, that's something for #thelounge-offtopic
