[10:24:18] <DiffieHellman> kompowiec2: Well, as for VS Code, that seems to use lots of JavaScript libraries with unclear licences and it also seems to use proprietary binaries to build by default.
[10:25:35] <kompowiec2> Bleh, and often someone recommended me to try instead of vim
[10:25:53] <DiffieHellman> You can install vscodium, but even then, the main way to get programming language support is to install seemingly proprietary binaries from the inbuilt store.

[16:32:38] <opal> >Liberapay shares similarities with the for-profit platform Patreon, but it does not allow creators to reward their patrons like Patreon does.
[16:32:42] <opal> i said an alternative to them
[16:33:01] <opal> if LP has something like webhooks then it could be made to do that i guess
[16:35:48] <kompowiec2> opal: Craiglist. Paying over internet is cancer
[16:37:02] <opal> that isnt an alternative, no wonder people stick with OF
[16:37:35] <opal> its like you didnt listen to anything i said the other day about actually promoting free software in a way that people would listen
[16:38:59] <opal> people stay with patreon and twitch and youtube because free alternatives want to remain inaccessible
[16:39:14] <opal> there are ways to approach accessibility without compromising on a well-designed platform
[16:40:55] <kompowiec2> People use this, because doesnt exist alternative for cash and gold

[17:00:57] <kompowiec2> 51% problem is unsolve in blockchain
[17:01:15] <kompowiec2> therefore its Multi Level Marketing
[17:02:42] <DiffieHellman> The 51% problem is unsolved, but it practice it's not an issue as a single miner can't outperform the rest of the miners on actually used cryptocurrency.
[17:03:15] <kompowiec2> Like BTC and china which have about 70% blockchain...
[17:03:44] <DiffieHellman> So china has 70% of the hash power?
[17:04:11] <kompowiec2> if anything happens to BTC, we'll find out that something terrible must have happened in China
[17:04:38] *** Joins: candrews (~candrews@gentoo/developer/candrews)
[17:05:49] <DiffieHellman> Well that would require all the miners in China getting together, which is not going to happen.
[17:06:32] <DiffieHellman> Even if it does happen, BTC can be hard forked, solving that issue.
[17:06:52] <kompowiec2> > The 51% problem is unsolved, but it practice it's not an issue as a single miner can't outperform the rest of the miners on actually used cryptocurrency.
[17:06:52] <kompowiec2> Bitcoin cash afaik must create break compatibility with this reason
[17:08:08] <DiffieHellman> Bitcoin cash was only created as 1 or just a few developers wanted to increase the blocksize, while the main BTC developers wouldn't.
[17:09:04] <DiffieHellman> You're not wrong that most cryptocurrencies are just a scam, a few aren't though.
[17:10:15] <kompowiec2> the fact that the currency is large does not protect against 51%, on the contrary, there is no incentive to maintain such large chains.
[17:10:35] <DiffieHellman> Huh? That's not how it works.
[17:11:27] <kompowiec2> so why most of the BTC block is in the country they want to ban ...

[17:12:12] <kompowiec2> the larger the block, the fewer people want to maintain it
[17:12:32] <DiffieHellman> Since all of those miners aren't working together on attacks on the network. If that starts happening, those miners willbe blocked.
[17:12:41] <kompowiec2> therefore it is highly commercialized
[17:13:29] <kompowiec2> > blocked
[17:13:29] <kompowiec2> Or just cut old blockchain and create new one
[17:13:49] <DiffieHellman> As for large blocksizes, that can be solved by trimming unneeded blocks.

[21:03:22] <craigt> higanbana: I would also suggest looking at https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/ScanCode_Toolkit It is a very useful tool for examining the licensing of a code base.

[21:10:20] <panosalevro> craigt: is there a good reason that in the license picker there are different versions of the names of the same licenses? eg. 'GPLv3' and 'GPL-3.0'
[21:10:52] <craigt> panosalevro: What's this now? :) (checking...)
[21:11:06] <kompowiec> hmm i noticed that I made another, more serious, mistake. I added 2 unnecessarily to the nickname on libreplanet and on IRC I have different. I worry about this - a few years ago someone created an account that tried to impersonate me (kompowiec0) on wikipedia and i got a WMF ban. It's possible to change nickname?
[21:11:53] <panosalevro> craigt: i think duplicates like that should be merged together
[21:12:11] <kompowiec> if not, i just create empty account

[21:15:32] <corwin> spdx clearly identifies which are free/libre vs OSI approved only, and provides a well adopted (e.g. nodejs and many other toolchains recognize).  Would it make sense to standardize the wiki on the code-names assigned here?  https://spdx.org/licenses/
[21:16:26] <craigt> higanbana: I don't mean to dump a bunch of homework on your lap! We have been working on an easier on-boarding process for new volunteers interested in adding to the Directory.

[21:17:14] <Noisytoot> corwin, I think the FSD is already moving to using SPDX license identifiers
[21:17:52] <craigt> Noisytoot: Hi! Welcome.
[21:17:58] <monkwitdafunk> Hello, can somebody link to me, which lisences are endorsed by the FSF

[21:19:42] <adfeno> panosalevro, craigt: License picker with different names for same license: sorry about that, I once proposed to change that, but per the votes made, the names themselves have to remain this way, but PLEASE select names matching the SPDX abbreviations.

[21:20:37] <craigt> panosalevro: It would help to only have the SPDX version listed, but there may be a reason why there is both.

[21:26:06] <adfeno> panosalevro: If I remember from the votes made, they decided to leave it this way since changing their displaytitle to something else like ‚Äú(deprecated name) old license name‚Äù would either be confusing to contributors, or take up too much space in the show/read tab.
[21:27:05] <panosalevro> right. i was hoping it was possible to merge them or something. or just rename them
[21:27:46] <adfeno> Unfortunatelly, merging them would require a mass replace on the wiki pages.
[21:29:39] <adfeno> If, however, you (or someone you know) have experience with both Semantic MediaWiki and MediaWiki's *internal back-end code* (including database), then this can be speed up.
[21:30:26] <craigt> We are into hour two of this week's Free Software Directory Meeting. If you are new or just want a refresher, check out the participation guidelines. https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate We also have the directory-discuss mailing list which you can sign up for at https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/directory-discuss
[21:31:25] <adfeno> panosalevro: In the past, we have attempted a mass replace using some MediaWiki extensions, and unfortunatelly it produced a huge job queue.
[21:33:52] <craigt> adfeno: So basically, we are stuck with both options to the same license(s) in the picker.
[21:35:08] <adfeno> Yes, and it became more confusing when the voters decided to keep the old names.
[21:35:42] <craigt> adfeno: I wonder if the tooltip could provide guidance to use SPDX over the other.

[21:36:55] <adfeno> (to make it clear, my proposal for renaming would only change the DISPLAYTITLE, so as far as I know, it wouldn't make too much of an overhead to the job queue)
[21:37:03] <panosalevro> i was also wondering if it's worth the trouble to change manually the entries using old names (whenever we happen to find them)
[21:37:29] <panosalevro> adfeno: yeah that's what i was thinking. doesnt sound like a demanding task
[21:39:01] <adfeno> panosalevro: If by entries you mean software entries (in the main namespace), then that was the proposal that was accepted, entries using old licenses would have to have these changed to SPDX ones next time when updated.
[21:39:03] <monkwitdafunk> I am having trouble finding the lisence for an iphone app, on github.io
[21:39:34] <craigt> monkwitdafunk: What's the link?

[21:57:23] <GNUtoo> I'll give an example. VLC for instance works on the iphone.
[21:57:44] <GNUtoo> As an user you have several ways to install VLC, some respect your freedoms some don't
[21:57:59] <GNUtoo> If you jailbreak your device, then freedom wise it's ok

[21:58:23] <kompowiec> by the very nature of the place, I wouldn't expect much help for iphone ...
[21:58:40] <GNUtoo> And for that to work you'd still need to find free programs to build modified versions of VLC
[21:59:03] <GNUtoo> Else to use the "freedom to modify the software", you'd need nonfree software

[22:00:13] <GNUtoo> If however you want VLC to be distributed to the appstore, the conditions imposed on the users make the program nonfree, and you might also need nonfree software to build the VLC source code

[22:11:40] <lfam> To me, it's an incredibly expansive de facto defnition of "malware", considering that google software is extremely useful and popular. "Malware" is more like a program that only does bad stuff

[22:17:34] <jxself> For one, an Invariant Section needs to meet the criteria of being a "Secondary Section" which is a defined term. So by definition an Invariant Section can't be part of the actual documentation of the software.
[22:17:35] <maximed> lfam: Exactly.

[22:18:19] <jxself> Yes, I see I mixed up acronyms.
[22:18:36] <GNUtoo> monkwitdafunk: Replicant sometimes crashes for some people
[22:18:49] <lfam> I see, thanks for the clarification jxself. So there is some kind of an exception carved out
[22:18:59] <jxself> https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.html
[22:19:07] <jxself> See the definition of a Secondary Section in there.
[22:19:17] <GNUtoo> Though In cases like that there is probably need for some drastic simplification of the software and hardware architecture to get the needed stability
[22:19:22] <jxself> "The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant."
[22:19:25] * craigt is reviewing updates to https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/WackoWiki
[22:19:42] <GNUtoo> Like if it behaves like a car that can kill you, a smartphone might not be the best tihng to handle insulin levels
[22:20:04] <jxself> So the GNU Manifesto fits the criteria of being Seconday since it's not about the actual documentation of the actual software but about why GNU was founded and why it exists and etc.
[22:20:07] <maximed> jxself: Ok, the secondary sections cannot actually document the software.
[22:20:14] <jxself> maximed: Right.
[22:20:26] <GNUtoo> So it probably depends on how much security against bugs APS system have
[22:20:49] <adfeno> maximed, lfam, jxself: if it weren't for the definition of Secondary Section, then I could act in bad faith and release a documentation under FDL entirely using Invariate Sections.
[22:20:50] <maximed> That prevents plenty of issues (e.g. a fork adding more documentation, but making the additional sections non-modifiable, thus non-free)
[22:21:28] <GNUtoo> about the DFSG and FSDG and all that, there might also be distributions that require game data to be modifiable as well

[22:23:49] <GNUtoo> So it would be good to somehow document that as well to make the data easily reusable by distributoins that are more stricts about non-functional data, though I don't know if that's already done or not
[22:23:57] <adfeno> I was once informed that DFSG (D for Debian) followed the Definition of Free Cultural Works (which mirrors all the freedoms of the software or of functional data, to non-functional data, which is generally art).
[22:24:03] <adfeno> ‚Ä¶ but I might be wrong.
[22:24:04] <GNUtoo> ok
[22:24:25] <GNUtoo> I also heard the same thing but I didn't check
[22:24:49] <adfeno> However, the DFSG (D for Debian) seems to cover mostly the ‚Äúmain‚Äù Debian repository.
[22:25:20] <maximed> jxself: What's the difference between an Invariant Section including the GNU Manifesto, and an Invariant Section including a cooking recipe? E.g., the documentation of the nettle crypographic library includes a recipe for nettle soup (it's not an invariant section though iirc).

[22:50:11] <GNUtoo> The idea is that for instance if I want a software that makes insulin pump work, if there is no software for that that fit the criteria, it might for instance be useful to have a way to find the ones that don't meet the criteria and look at them to see what is left to be fixed and fix them and then add them inside the directory for instance
[22:50:13] <craigt> scheme?
[22:50:39] <monkwitdafunk> For example, i have more medical insight if i can reference what medical directors can reference as the patient, so the medical organizations literature is the master, not the medical director

[22:52:38] <adfeno> craigt: Indeed, some can overlap with the goals of the Antifeatures Project Team.
[22:52:39] <GNUtoo> adfeno: ok. My idea was more like text that describe how to fix what's problematic for instance, in addition to some tag or anti-feature tag

[22:54:47] <adfeno> Although I don't know what is the status of the work of this Project Team, since the last time I heard about it, some people were relutant to support it since an anti-feature tag could probably pose as a bad thing to already-approved entries.

[23:02:55] <adfeno> craigt: Will do.
[23:06:20] <craigt> GNUtoo: A required nonfree-dependency simply makes the program using it nonfree.
[23:06:59] <craigt> GNUtoo: But having some means to track the nonfree-dependancies in the hope of freeing them seems worthwhile.

[23:17:09] <craigt> GNUtoo: If you are interested in being an admin (so you can approve your own entries), there is a path.

[23:23:03] <adfeno> ‚Ä¶ for the cases of Windows-only stuff such as Rufus.
[23:24:00] <GNUtoo> adfeno: good point. I've a good example with a "small nonfree GPU firmware" that ended up being a full blown OS that controlled the hardware in the raspberry PI: https://ownyourbits.com/2019/02/02/whats-wrong-with-the-raspberry-pi/ . Sometimes the consequences are way worse than we thought because when it's nonfree it can hide a lot of things...

[23:27:12] <adfeno> GNUtoo: luckly they corrected that.
[23:27:13] <craigt> tpefreedom: A free program running on a nonfree os should be examined on a case by case basis. However, if the idea is to introduce free software to someone captured by a nonfree os, I personally think it is ok to recommend the program, even if it is not truly free.
[23:27:33] <GNUtoo> adfeno: I was the one behind that fix
[23:27:52] <adfeno> Awesome, thank you very much GNUtoo ;)
[23:27:53] <GNUtoo> The issue was the package manager in ReactOS
[23:28:20] <GNUtoo> (It contained nonfree software in the "repositories")
[23:29:13] <GNUtoo> There was at least 1 nonfree IRC program and/or IM program if I recall well
[23:29:16] <tpefreedom> I think the GNU project's issue with reactos is also that it is meant for running nonfree windows software/drivers.

[23:30:41] <GNUtoo> But I want to collaborate with the criterias for Android applications as it also affects Replicant which is supposed to follow the FSDG guidelines
[23:31:05] <tpefreedom> Isn't f-droid not fsdg compliant anymore?

[23:31:41] <craigt> Well, that's a wrap. Thanks everybody for another great meeting.
[23:31:57] <adfeno> craigt: OK, so ideally GNUtoo would have to have a way to edit [[Collection:Replicant]] without being put under revision approval.
[23:32:14] <GNUtoo> ah yes, though I want to see about the criterias first

[23:34:30] <tpefreedom> Something using the linux kernel? FreeRTOS?
[23:35:39] <GNUtoo> It depends
[23:35:53] <GNUtoo> tpefreedom: how much RAM do you have?
[23:35:56] <adfeno> craigt: it seems that for GNUtoo to edit [[Collection:Replicant]] freely, they would have to be under the ‚ÄúAdministrators‚Äù MediaWiki group.

[23:37:10] <adfeno> I could change the page protection but I don't know if David_Hedlund (Team Captain of Free Software Replacements) will like it.
[23:37:23] <craigt> adfeno: that certainly seems by design...
[23:37:35] <GNUtoo> tpefreedom: if you have things like less than 4M of RAM, Linux won't work, with 4M or more it depends on the architecture, but you will probably need to strip the kernel as much as possible. On x86 16M isn't enough nowadays, and with 32M it seems to work fine.
[23:37:52] <tpefreedom> I have not tried out this stuff yet.
[23:38:13] <adfeno> tpefreedom, GNUtoo : wouldn't ProteanOS help in this case?
[23:38:15] <tpefreedom> I'm trying to figure out which embedded platform would be good to learn.
[23:38:19] <GNUtoo> tpefreedom: and it also depends on what you want to do, embedded system is typically making a computer do only 1 thing
[23:38:27] <adfeno> ProteanOS seems to be light.
[23:38:57] <GNUtoo> tpefreedom: ah, you probably need to look at FSDG distributions for that, for small systems there is ProteanOS and LibreCMC
[23:39:04] <craigt> adfeno: I definitely would defer to David before making any changes.
[23:39:05] <tpefreedom> The way I see it, there will always be a need for system level programmers as long as we have computers so it's one of the safest options.
[23:39:16] <GNUtoo> But even full blown distros like Guix could probably be customized for the embedded use case
[23:39:37] <craigt> adfeno: Can GNUtoo still submit edits and then wait for approval?
[23:39:43] <GNUtoo> Typically embedded systems try to be as simple as possible so removing Xorg support when you don't use it might be a good idea for instance
[23:39:59] <tpefreedom> So are things like FreeRTOS and RIOT worth looking into or not?
[23:40:11] <GNUtoo> It really depends on the use case
[23:40:27] <adfeno> craigt: Re: page protection: we can test.
[23:40:32] <GNUtoo> Personally I don't know FreeRTOS but it seem something interesting for systems between bare metal code and Linux
[23:40:59] <adfeno> GNUtoo: could you please try to make a simple test edit to Collection:Replicant, and see if you can submit it?
[23:41:02] <GNUtoo> At the other end of the spectrum you can still program in assembly or compiled languages like C without an OS, typically on systems with microcontrollers
[23:41:32] <GNUtoo> But sometimes you need OS features, so that's why there are microcontroller OS or OS for hardware with very few RAM
[23:41:35] <GNUtoo> ok
[23:42:13] <GNUtoo> I can't, I've only view source

[23:42:26] <GNUtoo> This page has been protected to prevent editing or other actions.
