[00:02:25] <ieure> "…the various Org imitators … reimplement the superficial features, not the underlying mechanism. Org only works right inside of Emacs."
[00:02:42] <grym> BNF? what's that? :D 
[00:06:37] <rdrg109> Is it possible to set the number of spaces for a given code block so that when tangling that number of spaces are used for that specific content?
[00:07:33] <rdrg109> I have a past thought on that but I'm not sure it was an idea that I wanted to be implemented or saw someone else using it

[00:16:22] <rdrg109> This question https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20894683/control-indentation-with-org-babel mentions the :indent-level header argument but this word is not mentioned in the Org Mode source code so I guess it is not in the core codebase

[12:18:00] <rdrg109> afidegnum: So, what you want to do is to hide the #+PROPERTY statements, right?
[12:18:11] <afidegnum> yes,

[12:21:52] <rdrg109> I know three approaches: (1) Set the proper header arguments in org-babel-default-header-args:sql. This is not always desirable because this will affect all SQL code blocks even if they are in different files.
[12:22:37] <afidegnum> I think it's best to have per/file headers arguments
[12:23:31] <rdrg109> (2) Insert all the #+PROPERTY statements in a drawer as seen here: http://0x0.st/-9ba.org . You might know that it is possible to fold drawers, so you would collapse the drawer that contain all your #+PROPERTY: statements.
[12:24:21] <afidegnum> what's the use of prologue and epilogue here ? 
[12:25:27] <rdrg109> They just insert content before and after the actual content of the code block. Press C-c C-v C-v (org-babel-expand-src-block) in a code block with those header arguments and you will see the magic.
[12:25:44] <afidegnum> ok, 
[12:25:48] <rdrg109> Not all languages support those header arguments, SQL is one of them.
[12:26:30] <yeti>   :header-args:sh: :results output :exports both :eval no-export

[15:11:21] <bkhl> I was looking at org-journal and similar things earlier this week and saw something that I thought I'd try out, but didn't save the link unfortunately.
[15:11:46] <bkhl> There was a capture template to insert a journal entry for the current date, or jump to it if it is already there.
[15:12:24] <bkhl> Or possibly it wasn't a capture template but just a separate function, but googling for it now I just find dozens of different ways to do similar but not exactly the same thing with capture templates …
[15:13:01] <bkhl>  Anyone here using something like this and have a handy link?
[15:15:41] <bkhl> Would probably use org-journal except I want to have dual journals for work/personal stuff, and it seems like a lot of work to tack that on to it (or someone would have done it already …)\

[21:55:08] <grym> my general approach has been that json's fine as long as no human ever has to _write_ it, yaml's gross, and if a human needs to write it but a machine needs to read it, i've been OK with TOML 
[21:55:25] <Demosthenex> as much as i despise xml, it's tight as a drum.

[22:21:53] <rdrg109> davdunc: You don't need a ob-{{foo}} file to be able to tangle, you can tangle whatever code block, you just need to specify the :tangle header argument. Having {{{ #+BEGIN_SRC MySuperDuperLanguage :tangle ~/e/main.txt }}} would be enough for tanling that code block to ~/e/main.txt
[22:23:19] <rdrg109> I mention this because I think that you were thinking that because you didn't have a ob-yaml file, you wouldn't be able to tangle YAML code blocks

[22:26:22] <davdunc> @rdrg109 I did think I needed an ob-yaml file. 
[22:27:07] <davdunc> but I did want to use the breakout to the yaml-mode buffer for editing 
[22:28:20] <rdrg109> davdunc: Does "breakout" means C-c ' (org-edit-special -> org-edit-src-code)?

[22:28:58] <grym> you just need a yaml major mode for that, then

[22:30:30] <davdunc> makes sense grym I was thinking that having a babel language support might open it specifically for the temp buffer. 
[22:30:41] <rdrg109> davdunc: What grym said. Just by having the major-mode defined, C-c ' will open a buffer with that major mode, so if you have #+BEGIN_SRC MySuperDuperLanguage and you have also defined MySuperDuperLanguage-mode, you will be able to edit that code block with C-c '

[23:08:41] <rdrg109> [Q] Do any of you know how does Org Mode parses HTTPS links? I'm creating a function that collect all the URLs in the current buffer regardless of the major mode so instead of creating my own regular expression, I would like to use the one that Org Mode internally uses for highlighting HTTPs links.
[23:10:59] <davdunc> rdrg109: is it not shr? 
[23:12:40] <rdrg109> davdunc: I don't know the technical details of that package. I only know that it is bundled with Emacs.
[23:14:11] <davdunc> ah. I see you are looking for what is happening in org-element-link-parser
[23:14:55] <rdrg109> Found this line in the Org Mode source code: (get-text-property (point) 'shr-url), but shr-url is not a variable that contains that regular expression.
[23:15:01] <rdrg109> I'm gonna look into org-element-link-parser.
[23:16:04] <rdrg109> I just want to know how Org Mode is able to highlight HTTPs URLs in the current buffer, I'm pretty sure it uses a regular expression, so that way I will be able to use that regular expression in my own function.
