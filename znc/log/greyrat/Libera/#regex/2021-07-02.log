[00:02:20] <JohnDoe2> re101-zorse-97 I don't think anyone owes you a solution here, unfortunately, doctor. And specifically because regex is not meant to work on HTML - wrong tool, and you don't care about helping yourself but just looking for free labor -- your requests become off-putting.
[00:02:38] <lopid> i rather think it's trying to troll us
[00:03:13] <JohnDoe2> re101-gecko-10 I grepped for 491054 and no such value exists. can you be specific?
[00:04:13] <JohnDoe2> re101-gecko-10 are we looking at content-length ?
[00:04:25] <lopid> we're supposed to imagine it
[00:04:28] <re101-gecko-10> yes
[00:04:36] <lopid> confirmed
[00:05:00] <re101-zorse-97> JohnDoe2 I'm trying to alter and use the earlier RegEx but it ain't working. What can I do other than ask here?

[00:08:07] <JohnDoe2> re101-zorse-97 move your duplicate css out of each html tag, remove silly rules - think of css as changing default behavior rather than a self-conflicted tool that needs correction from one tag to the next, google for things, watch free html/css lessons on youtube...

[00:20:28] <re101-zorse-97> Guys, pls help me also https://regex101.com/r/TNg4oe/1
[00:25:56] <genio> I'd suggest any programming language with access to an HTML parser that could do what you want. tidy the markup, use a proper parser to clean up what you don't like, have it re-print out the html to a file and call it a day
[00:26:53] <genio> As has been pointed out, what you're wanting to do is not really best suited for regular expressions.
[00:27:25] <genio> And the good thing about a program written to do it is that it would be repeatable more easily than some expressions run in notepad++
[00:30:42] <re101-zorse-97> I cud not find anything better but this is working for me:
[00:31:00] <re101-zorse-97> You're correct, microsoft word -> html -> np++ for regex replacements to "fix" issues.
[00:32:11] <re101-zorse-97> Pls help this once, I won't bother you guys for at least 10 more days then https://regex101.com/r/TNg4oe/1
[00:34:36] <NiLon> this is good example of why you never use inline styles
[00:34:42] <re101-zorse-97> OK, this `(?-s)(?=.*mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>-)([^<]*)(?=<br>)` finds what I want
[00:34:43] <NiLon> and I'm sure you were told that
[00:35:16] <re101-zorse-97> Lemme see if I can do the replacement
[00:35:44] <NiLon> also don't regex html, use DOM
[00:35:53] <NiLon> you are making it way harder than it needs to be
[00:37:31] <NiLon> and while you are at it, just make it proper fix rather than another stupid patch you need to fix 10 days from now
[00:37:32] <re101-zorse-97> OK, I think I got the solution. I used this in the replace field: `mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'><table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-style:

[02:33:15] <re101-dusky-68>  Hello:  https://regex101.com/r/jekOTK/1
[02:33:22] <re101-dusky-68>  How would I not capture that final - on many of my captures?
[02:34:25] <OnlineCop> You usually need to double the logic: [^\d]+(?:-[^\d]+)+
[02:34:40] *** Quits: palasso (~palasso@user/palasso) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:35:16] <OnlineCop> What do you want [^\d] to match?
[02:35:26] <OnlineCop> Right now, it matches hyphens, newlines, and everything except digits.
[02:36:23] <OnlineCop> I'd personally do something more akin to this, unless this is explicitly what you're trying to avoid (digits in the first section before the 1st '-'): https://regex101.com/r/jekOTK/2
[02:36:49] <OnlineCop> If that's the case, you might try: https://regex101.com/r/jekOTK/3
[02:37:37] *** Quits: joo (~joo@87-49-45-207-mobile.dk.customer.tdc.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:38:49] <re101-dusky-68> Yeah, probably not the best approach, but from the beginning some hosts have a single word before the fqdn stuff, others have many hyphenated or start with digits, so I want to capture enough from the left side that would make it match, but exclude the final - or any of the final numbers because I just want enough.  For example, if I have a few
[02:38:50] <re101-dusky-68> hosts, abc123, abc345, def123, def987, I would just want create a lookup table with abc and def.
[02:38:52] <OnlineCop> The `\W` there is the opposite of `\w`, so [^a-zA-Z_0-9]. Within that [^...] group, it's going to double-negate it, but then also explicitly forbid 0-9, so `[a-zA-Z_]`.
[02:38:55] <re101-dusky-68> I hope that makes sense
[02:39:18] <OnlineCop> Well, does this match what _you_ want it to match?
[02:40:05] <re101-dusky-68> A little too much
[02:40:16] <OnlineCop> Do you want to exclude all digits?
[02:40:16] <re101-dusky-68> For example...ads-1.acme.com
[02:40:17] <re101-dusky-68> ads-2.acme.com
[02:40:27] <OnlineCop> Or digits under circumstances?
[02:40:32] <re101-dusky-68> I would need only ads in that case
[02:40:50] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/jekOTK/4 maybe?
[02:41:17] <re101-dusky-68> Super close, but id didn
[02:41:24] <re101-dusky-68> Didn't match the top number hosts
[02:41:43] <OnlineCop> The first portion can contain digits as long as there are also letters?
[02:41:44] <re101-dusky-68> They begin with a number
[02:41:55] <re101-dusky-68> Yes
[02:43:07] <re101-dusky-68> What about this:  https://regex101.com/r/QO27Mv/1

[02:48:10] <OnlineCop> Wait, that wasn't what I saved...
[02:48:27] <OnlineCop> Oh, yeah it was. Had an old window open.
[02:50:45] <OnlineCop> For 'ads-1', you want only 'ads' because '-1' contains a hyphen ending in a digit?
