[03:25:56] <Joanna> Everytime I go out I see zombies staring at phones.
[03:27:20] <Joanna> What ever happened to the idea of striking up conversations with people nearby when bored or needing to find out information ?
[03:30:10] <Joanna> People have outsourced all their attention to their phones. The only thing that makes them stop starting at phones is if someone starts attacking them and they have to run for their lives.
[03:30:23] <Joanna> Staring
[03:32:53] <Joanna> It’s rare to see people in public not staring at phones.
[03:55:01] <jan6> because internet provides more than random people on the street ever could
[03:55:11] <jan6> they provide all that they can, and more
[03:56:31] <jan6> random facts and things that happened to the random person? check, "have you heard"? check, "anyone know X?" check, etc etc
[03:56:50] <jan6> plus also videos, ebooks, games, and a bunch of other things
[03:57:31] <jan6> people are more social than ever, heck, you can IRC from your phone if you want to
[03:58:17] <jan6> people just don't like to go physically up to strangers anymore, because people like their pseudonymous semblance of anonymity, and privacy
[04:00:20] <jan6> TheHonker145 talking about how bad their job sucks, doesn't run the risk of that person then awkwardly ending up having to deal with that random person at their job, for example, and people disagreeing, can just block each other, instead of having to physically try to go as far away as they can (which, if you're waiting, you probably can't go that far, anyway), etc
[04:00:47] <jan6> a *LOT* of benefits, with only minor downsides
[04:01:40] <jan6> then there's also filling the void in their soul, left by soulcrushing jobs and lives, which they see no way out of, and as such just have to deal with
[04:01:47] <jan6> etc etc

[05:41:17] <jan6> if you're LITERALLY dying, then some people will definitely stop by
[05:42:09] <jan6> only problem is SOME people, which varies by location
[05:43:25] <jan6> being beaten up, probably less so, because unless the person is trained, or has a gun or weapon ready to go, all they'll do is just get beaten up themselves, also, if it's several people
[05:44:55] <jan6> that, and beatings generally don't happen in that public spaces anyway, afaik, like, if it's around a corner somewhere, then it's also gonna be pretty hard to see if you're focusing on yourself, and your immediate environment, and not monitoring everything around you
[05:45:03] <jan6> cars are pretty good at blocking sound, too
[05:45:47] <jan6> etc
[05:50:31] <jan6> and also it's not only a matter of WANTING to stop, but also having TIME to stop, because if you stop by to call an ambulance, or try to help a person otherwise, you're probably gonna have to stay around that place for a while, such as till the ambulance arrives, or whatnot, and oftentimes people have tight schedules, especially if they've pre-arranged stuff, like if you have an appointment, is the
[05:50:32] <jan6> priority helping someone else, and ending up getting pushed back month(s) yourself? for you, probably, but for a lot of people, not really
[05:50:44] <jan6> "someone else will have the time, I'm in a hurry"
[05:51:44] <jan6> unsurprisingly there's plenty of situations of a crowd of people gathering around someplace, all of them thinking "well, someone else must've have notified people, right?"
[05:52:23] <jan6> sometimes, nobody has, and too many reports is safer than too little, generally

[06:06:16] <jan6> Good recipe. Here in India we bring the milk to a boil and add lemon juice, the cottage cheese is rapidly formed. Also if we want the cheese to feel salted we add salt to the milk jus before adding the lemon juice. Soon after the cottage cheese forms we strain the wey and wash the cheese in cold water to stop the cooking and to remove the sour taste of lemon. The wey water is used for making flat

[23:01:39] <jan6> also, fun things are LessPass, which never stores anything, and lets you generate passwords based on option checkboxes, master password, and "site url" and "login" (which can be filled with anything), plus an iteration count

[23:01:51] <Zwolf12> i'd rather write them on a piece of paper than in a safe online :p

[23:02:29] <Zwolf12> passwordcard
[23:02:33] <Zwolf12> k
[23:02:40] <jan6> but the concept is "generate a card full of random data, and then come up with your own rules, for convenience there are some segments of purely one type, also there's colors"
[23:02:54] <jan6> https://www.passwordcard.org/en
[23:03:07] <Zwolf12> haaa
[23:03:11] <jan6> it's meant to be laminated and stuff
[23:03:14] <Zwolf12> some of it happens only in your head then
[23:03:33] <jan6> you could also write it down, as a riddle or equasion or whatever
[23:03:50] <jan6> as long as the card, and the solution, are never together, people will most likely have no clue
[23:04:32] <jan6> the old java jar is great to keep as a failsafe, in case the website goes down
[23:04:42] <jan6> in case you need to re-generate a card
[23:06:01] <jan6> it prints to terminal, without colors or such fancy stuff, but good enough for a failsafe, the algorithm is also public https://www.passwordcard.org/algorithm.html

[23:14:16] <jan6> while they might be eventually connected to each other, you could share IPs through VPN-like setups, agree on same exact browser profiles, syncing cookies & data, etc, and try to act as the same personality, but different for each account, but still state your comment, e.g. one loving to use emojis, and one being all serious, but both can express your opinion about loving X or hating Y, even if
