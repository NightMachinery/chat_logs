[02:03:27] <ecdhe> Are there any IMAP servers that use something besides maildir as a backing store?
[02:04:34] <jaybe> yes
[02:27:54] <ecdhe> which ones?

[05:02:50] <pj> and there's another one as well I think, but I can't remember the name.
[05:03:04] <pj> but certainly I would caution against such an approach.

[05:05:40] <pj> hrmmmm
[05:06:10] <pj> dovecot has mdbox which is arguably better than maildir except in the compatibility department.
