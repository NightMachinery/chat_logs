[05:10:15] <howdoi> hah hah, thanks :D
[05:11:03] <hassoon> howdoi: at least make only the body scrollable, so that the grid stretches to the text size

[05:14:11] <howdoi> I feel, I can break the content into newer grid cells, I don't want to fit it in the same
[05:28:11] <hassoon> howdoi: make it truncated with ellipsis effect, then when hovered, it will show up all but in a position-absolute way, that i overlays part of the whole grid, then goes back to normal when you move the mouse away from it

[07:42:29] <inayeth> Hi Everybody
[07:43:55] <inayeth> I have this search bar with the button on the bottom,  how can I get the search button on the same row as the search field? https://jsfiddle.net/qy1t57m8/
[07:45:38] <FunkyBob> by default input and button are inline elements, so they should naturally... however bootstrap seems to have decided to override that
[07:45:52] <FunkyBob> you might want to ask in ##bootstrap for an idiomatic bootstrap solution
[07:46:13] <FunkyBob> maybe they have a class you can add to tell it to be inline... or a joined button or something
