[01:53:45] <vandusen> [eggs repo (r40962, by Zipheir)] Fix formatting typo.
[01:55:55] <Zipheir> Can set-sharp-read-syntax! be used to read #u8"..." notation?  I'm a little confused by how it differs from set-read-syntax!.
[01:57:34] <Zipheir> Oh, apparently not.  Either a single character or a #!<SYMBOL> syntax can be defined.
[01:58:50] <Zipheir> It could be hacked by using set-parameterized-read-syntax!, I guess; #8u is close enough to #u8, but, ugh.
[01:59:56] <wasamasa> srfi-4.scm be doing funny things
[02:00:39] <Zipheir> I suppose I'll just have to hijack the reader à la SRFI 105.
[02:01:48] <wasamasa> it uses ##sys#user-read-hook to hijack anything starting with u/s/f
[02:02:43] <wasamasa> then it reads in a sexp and if it's something like u8, it uses list->u8vector on whatever follows
[02:03:20] <wasamasa> could be possible to extend that code to check whether what follows is a list or string
[02:05:26] <Zipheir> Thanks, that seems worth looking at.
[02:06:18] <Zipheir> SRFI 207 already provides the parser procedure, so it's just a matter of gluing that to the reader.
[02:07:24] <wasamasa> its semantics are documented in library.scm
