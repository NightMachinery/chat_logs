[04:53:51] <Nanobot> I got tonsillitis. But I think it cleared up a couple of minutes afterward.
[04:56:01] <Nanobot> Basically, my throat closed up and I suddenly couldn't drink any water or really swallow at all. I ran to the bathroom and with a flashlight and looked in my mouth. My left tonsil was swollen, with a big visible white streak. I run back to the computer to look up symptoms. Yep, tonsillitis. First time in my life. A couple of minutes late, and I could swallow again. I checked myself in the mirror, and the swelling is gone.

[06:31:55] <Anizawa> lots of good anime
[06:32:05] <Anizawa> I need to make my tierlist

[06:32:21] <amigojapan> Hi Anizawa 
[06:32:26] <Anizawa> still bent on deciding if the best was vivy or odd taxi
[06:32:36] <Anizawa> you know I'm gonna say odd taxi for originality
[06:32:36] <Resident_AEVA> I still need to get around to the SAO Ancilization box sets that I bought.
[06:32:46] <Anizawa> SAO = bad

[06:33:26] <Resident_AEVA> I liked it.  Sinon was my favorite.

[06:33:34] <Anizawa> how
[06:33:36] <Anizawa> it was good
[06:33:46] <Anizawa> like I cried at the end
[06:33:57] <Anizawa> I'm a 20 year old man goddamnit
[06:34:09] <amigojapan> Anizawa: it was not bad but like people are saying "anime of the decade
[06:34:19] <Resident_AEVA> I also LOOOVEEEE Jeanne d'Arc Alter.
[06:34:19] <Anizawa> well to be fair the decade hasn't started yet proper
[06:34:37] <amigojapan> Anizawa: I am 44 years old
[06:34:41] <Anizawa> Resident_AEVA: I used to think saber was hot too until saberface became a thing and they all became the same
[06:35:51] <Resident_AEVA> Eh, I just like her being all dressed in black and looking like she's ready to wreck.
[06:36:11] <Anizawa> I didn't like the new fate movies
[06:36:19] <Anizawa> I guess I never had a thing for HF
[06:36:33] <Anizawa> I wonder if ufotable will adapt hollow/ataraxia
[06:36:37] <amigojapan> Anizawa: I will give it this, it is one of the animes with a most powerful beginning I have seen
[06:36:55] <Resident_AEVA> I did like Carnival Phantasm.
[06:37:07] <Anizawa> I didn't watch it yet
[06:37:41] <Resident_AEVA> It's great, all the Type Moon characters interacting with each other.
[06:39:46] <amigojapan> Anizawa: I guess anime of the year is not hard cause everything is so crappy these days
[06:39:58] <Anizawa> I think my main gripes is that
[06:40:02] <Anizawa> every anime looks the same
[06:40:47] <Resident_AEVA> I'm wondering when in the heck Netflix will release the second part of the new GITS anime.
[06:41:25] <amigojapan> I want them to maintain the anime aesthetic
[06:42:01] <Anizawa> I mean anime looked better in 2011
[06:42:05] <Resident_AEVA> I just want a good story.
[06:42:17] <Anizawa> also come on mushoku tensei man

[06:46:01] <Anizawa> eeeeeeeh
[06:46:05] <Anizawa> I liked the 2000s better
[06:46:07] <Anizawa> you know
[06:46:08] <Anizawa> haruhi
[06:46:20] <Anizawa> 80s anime was full of ova schlock
[06:46:21] <amigojapan> I like haruhi yes
[06:46:24] <Anizawa> even Lupin III was bad in the 80s come on
[06:46:48] <amigojapan> Many people would disagree on that
[06:47:48] <Anizawa> now the 90s had more uh
[06:47:50] <Anizawa> watchable anime
[06:47:50] <amigojapan> Lupin III was not my thing anyway
[06:47:55] <Anizawa> Gunsmith Cats was cool
[06:48:04] <ButterNoodle> I liked the 90s
[06:48:18] <ButterNoodle> *licked

[07:02:48] <Anizawa> when I saw ultimate the last episode still wasn't out
[07:02:48] <Resident_AEVA> That's cause they fired the first studio and switched to another.

[07:03:15] <Resident_AEVA> Something like that.
[07:03:28] <Resident_AEVA> Then Geneon went out of business, so we had to wait for Funimation to pick it up.
[07:03:37] <Resident_AEVA> Then Funi just dragged on the series.

[07:41:52] <Matt|home> i just saw the dumbest movie with my dad.. unintentionally hilarious in almost every aspect, but there was _ONE_
[07:41:54] <Matt|home> _one_ joke
[07:42:02] <Matt|home> that hit what they were aiming for in the whole movie
[07:42:44] <Matt|home> the joke that hit: this gamer guy is being an idiot livestreaming this MMO, and his mom is vacuuming in the background. he throws an autistic tantrum "GOD MOM IM TALKING TO MY FRIENDS" mom: "YOU'RE TWENTY TWO AND LIVING IN MY HOUSE, THERE IS NO GOD"
[07:42:45] <Matt|home> :D
[07:42:53] <Nanobot> I think Calliope "your boy is bad at games" Mori is now officially the best Jump King player in Hololive.
[07:44:05] <Nanobot> AFAIK, nobody else has done it in less than 8 hours, and Calli just did it in 1 hour 1 minute. And a significant part of that time was just her experimenting, as preparation for her "real" run.

[14:52:14] <MootPoot> Anizawa: she' just kick you in the nuts and leave you in a ditch, lets be real now
[14:52:18] <DunceCotus> Bco1981: cause without the Earth's atmosphere they should be super clear
[14:52:21] <Bco1981> DunceCotus: that is how a camera works when it gets too bright light in. it can't see the dim lights.
[14:52:29] <Anizawa> no we need like
[14:52:32] <Anizawa> genetically engineered imoutos
[14:52:37] <Anizawa> that will obey every whim of yours
[14:52:40] <MootPoot> so they kick harder?
[14:52:41] <DunceCotus> Bco1981: well they could adjust that in camera settings
[14:52:43] <DunceCotus> for the shot
[14:53:03] <DunceCotus> reduce shutterspeed etc.
[14:53:41] <Bco1981> they could have, but that wasn't their objective this time.
[14:53:45] <DunceCotus> Bco1981: this is my problem with these endeavours.. they seem wilfully deceptive
[14:54:05] <DunceCotus> Bco1981: even NASA doesn't do this
[14:54:17] <DunceCotus> its like HRMM
[14:54:28] <DunceCotus> yes we see the pretty Earth ball

[14:54:37] <DunceCotus> now look out in outerspace -- you're there!
[14:55:12] <DunceCotus> so either they are not there
[14:55:22] <DunceCotus> or if they turned the camera it would show the top of a pool or something
[14:55:37] <DunceCotus> or it would just show complete darkness
[14:55:54] <DunceCotus> which I guess it would if they didn't adjust aperture etc
[14:56:33] <DunceCotus> but what if the did adjust for the low-light
[14:56:40] <DunceCotus> and its still complete darkness?
[14:56:50] <DunceCotus> stars then may be an atmospheric phenomenon
[14:56:51] <Anizawa> MootPoot: you'll get it when it happens, dig it
[14:57:12] <MootPoot> pizza
[14:57:18] <Anizawa> pizza ain't everything
[14:57:27] <Anizawa> you have to stop being a person that only cares about pizza and chocolate
[14:57:32] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I want pizza too
[14:57:47] <Anizawa> cant get decent pízza where I am at even
[14:57:53] <MootPoot> Anizawa: you're right - I'll only care about pizza, fuck chocolate

[14:58:18] <Anizawa> you gotta care about uhhhh
[14:58:24] <Anizawa> that new youjo senki season that will come out soon
[14:58:28] <Anizawa> tanyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[14:58:40] <Bco1981> MootPoot: no chocolate no valentine...
[14:58:59] <DunceCotus> I don't care so much about shape of the world as the extent of it
[14:59:37] <DunceCotus> and how it is divided up into territories, striation
[15:00:13] <DunceCotus> I believe it could be a spherical shape
[15:00:39] <DunceCotus> though I feel like there's places we cannot go on this sphere
[15:01:57] <MootPoot> uranus
[15:02:20] <Bco1981> yeah we can't go to the deepest part of the ocean.

[15:03:06] <Anizawa> sounds kinda boring tbh
[15:03:10] <DunceCotus> well by cannot I more meant its a closed-off possibility
[15:03:15] <Anizawa> there's literally nothing in there

[15:03:37] <Anizawa> you know what we need
[15:03:39] <MootPoot> god damn
[15:03:40] <Anizawa> we need full dive VR

[15:08:03] <Anizawa> but amigo that ain't how it works
[15:08:07] <Anizawa> life outside is boring aswell
[15:08:11] <Anizawa> I'm talking like
[15:08:15] <Anizawa> living another era, cool shit like that
[15:08:26] <Anizawa> being someone important
[15:08:36] <Bco1981> ^no thanks
[15:08:51] <amigojapan> You would say another era is boring if you could go
[15:08:53] <DunceCotus> Anizawa: what you want is to have your cake and sell photos of it as NFTs?
[15:09:09] <Anizawa> I want to go back to 2010 and buy all bitcoin possible
[15:09:22] <Bco1981> i feel what every anime MC harem lead says... "i want my peace and quiet"
[15:09:46] <DunceCotus> Anizawa: that would be your ideal VR 'metaverse'?
[15:09:57] <Anizawa> no that would be my ideal life plan
[15:10:00] <DunceCotus> return to 2010, buy bitcoin
[15:10:01] <Anizawa> unfortunately time travel doesn't exist
[15:10:03] * MootPoot is wondering what to eat
[15:10:07] <DunceCotus> enjoy VR riches
[15:10:18] <Anizawa> seriously if I could

[15:10:29] <Anizawa> I'd go back to the 90's and live there
[15:10:29] <Anizawa> lol
[15:10:32] <DunceCotus> this is why I think bitcoin may have come from the future
[15:10:36] <Anizawa> nowadays things are too bad
[15:10:46] <Anizawa> who made bitcoin anyways
[15:10:50] <Anizawa> wasn't it some japanese guy
[15:10:54] <Anizawa> bet he's rich as fuck 
[15:11:06] <DunceCotus> the creator of bitcoin is a time-traveller
[15:11:33] <amigojapan> I think the maker of bitcoin is anonymous, goes by "satoshi
[15:11:33] <Anizawa> honestly I don't doubt it
[15:11:36] <DunceCotus> he made bitcoin in order to guarantee money and resources by their time
[15:11:58] <Anizawa> plot twist
[15:12:01] <DunceCotus> perhaps there are clues in the blockchain
[15:12:03] <DunceCotus> if you want to wade
[15:12:04] <Anizawa> HE WAS ELON MUSK ALL ALONG
[15:12:09] <Anizawa> ...shocking truth
[15:12:16] <DunceCotus> double twist: Elon Musk is a time-traveller

[15:15:15] <Anizawa> that is a problem
[15:15:19] <Anizawa> just don't connect it to the internet?
[15:15:20] <darkwitch> hey flatearther
[15:15:42] <DunceCotus> Anizawa: there is no need for us to share the space
[15:15:58] <DunceCotus> however that invariably happens with alliance and filiation
[15:16:49] <Anizawa> I see
[15:16:51] <DunceCotus> Anizawa: basically if we did create our own VR, I think it would develop similar problems to Real Life
[15:16:59] <Anizawa> I disagree
[15:17:06] <Anizawa> because with VR you can bail
[15:17:10] <Anizawa> you can't bail from real life
[15:17:25] <Anizawa> and I assume you could have your own personal little construct right?
[15:17:33] <DunceCotus> well a VR you can bail from is also less immersive
[15:17:45] <Anizawa> why would you make a VR you can't bail from
[15:18:08] <DunceCotus> without the visceral connective tissue adjoining your body and the plane (of consistency), what's the appeal?
[15:18:19] <DunceCotus> it'd just be an advanced videogame, fun I guess
[15:18:23] <DunceCotus> may even be artistic
[15:19:20] <DunceCotus> Anizawa: my point is if we assume we are in a VR for a second, why can we not bail?
[15:19:22] <Anizawa> I was thinking the tech could be advanced enough (let's say in 100 years or whatever) that it could simulate the entire universe
[15:19:25] <DunceCotus> perhaps death is 'bailing'
[15:19:32] <Anizawa> why would we be in vr
[15:19:35] <Anizawa> you die and it's over man
[15:19:42] <DunceCotus> overman yes
[15:19:58] <Anizawa> vr is a new concept, if you asked someone back in the 50s about it they'd call you crazy
[15:20:27] <DunceCotus> if it gets so advanced that it becomes indistinguishable from real life
[15:20:44] <DunceCotus> then I think you're gonna get a lot of psychosis.. that is to say real life needn't be an original (and isn't)
[15:21:01] <Anizawa> maybe
[15:21:07] <Anizawa> but I think its gonna happen

[15:21:43] <Anizawa> lol
[15:21:51] <DunceCotus> why is this VR game so painful, why is bailing so elusive?
[15:22:07] <DunceCotus> Anizawa: maybe we are cosmic-level masochists
[15:22:08] <Anizawa> maybe the guy running it has a penchant for cruelty?
[15:22:18] <DunceCotus> putting ourselves in our own mind games

[16:17:55] <Sadale> I've actually thought about preparing such a USB. Like having an offline internet.

[16:27:37] <Sadale> Anyway most pics are actually in wikicommon or wikimedia or something like that
[16:27:50] <Sadale> So I think 87GB would barely get you any pics
[16:28:15] <MootPoot> well, the text only one is like 20
[16:28:28] <MootPoot> most of the wiki pics are pretty small
[16:32:20] <MootPoot> imagine if the internet did go down Sadale 
[16:32:26] <MootPoot> and only we had wikipedia copies
[16:32:34] <MootPoot> it would be like that shitty smartphone manga
[16:32:36] <Sadale> MootPoot, that'd be very helpful. You could sell the copy

[16:33:16] <Sadale> MootPoot, I'm not sure if it's still the case in Cuba. Last time I've heard from a Cuban, internet were very expensive. So the local people built their own local network that isn't connected to the internet.
[16:33:33] <Sadale> MootPoot, And inside the local network, they've got an internal gitlab, internal wikipedia mirror, etc. etc.
[16:33:34] <MootPoot> there was a documentary about that
[16:34:03] <MootPoot> was it very expensive or just govt controlled
[16:34:35] <Sadale> MootPoot, Actually, there're several local networks. Each network spans across a region and built by different group of people. For example, the network in Havana isn't accessible in somewhere far from Havana

[16:36:21] <Sadale> MootPoot, from my first hand information I've never heard about it being censored.
[16:37:10] <MootPoot> should ship my entire anime/hentai collection to cuba for them
[16:37:12] <Sadale> s/first hand information/almost first hand information from my friend
[16:37:48] <Sadale> Anyway, based on the information I have, Cuba is nowhere as oppressive as you thought. Before the major protest, the internet access was simply unrestricted albeit being super expensive.

[17:11:27] <MootPoot> You know why they didnt keep me?
[17:11:48] <MootPoot> because I needed info to complete my task - I went to the person in question and asked them 
[17:11:56] <MootPoot> since my supervisor was on leave
[17:12:00] <Sadale> wut?
[17:12:09] <MootPoot> then they came back form leave and then got mad because I made them look bad
[17:12:11] <MootPoot> lmao
[17:12:14] <Sadale> That sounds like a very stupid reason not to keep someone
[17:12:34] <Sadale> I'm sorry to hear about that
[17:12:36] <MootPoot> they wanted me to make the TOS page for their app
[17:12:47] <MootPoot> so I went to the legal person in the company directly and asked them
[17:12:54] <MootPoot> for the TOS text so I can put it in
[17:13:24] <MootPoot> That, and also they were bullshitted by microsoft to ohard
[17:13:45] <MootPoot> the M$ sales reps made them believe something was possible
[17:13:52] <MootPoot> where it probably was technically, but 
[17:14:12] <MootPoot> time, effort and resources are not infinite
[17:14:17] <MootPoot> otherwsie we could do everything
[17:14:24] <Sadale> Things could have went much better even if they weren't happy about you asking for the ToS directly from the legal person. They could just politely tell you not to do that the next time. :/
[17:14:46] <MootPoot> The legal person was okay with it
[17:14:54] <MootPoot> they told me they'd give it to me in a few days
[17:14:59] <Sadale> I know. It's your supervisor who wasn't ok with that.
[17:15:19] <MootPoot> roll foreward 2 weeks late I still havent done my work because of it , and I asked again, then the legal person talked to my supervisor
[17:15:22] <Sadale> oh. Was the legal person an employee of the company tho?
[17:15:27] <MootPoot> yes
[17:15:29] <MootPoot> all internal
[17:15:36] <Sadale> I see. That's weird indeed.
[17:15:40] <MootPoot> effectively all I did was contact legal directly
[17:15:56] <Sadale> ah. That's explain why it made them look bad
[17:16:51] <MootPoot> it does?
[17:17:07] <MootPoot> my supervisor was away and I needed to complete my work 
[17:17:08] <Sadale> I dunno. It depends on the company I guess?
[17:17:24] <MootPoot> and I did the stuff to try and get the items to complete my work
[17:17:30] <MootPoot> well it was a small 4 person company so
[17:17:37] <amigojapan> !memo anizawa this anime probably has one of the best tragic endings, just make sure you watch the 1975 version and not the remake https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_of_Flanders_(TV_series)
[17:17:40] <MootPoot> probably a lot of politics at play
[17:17:44] <Sadale> oh. That's very small.
[17:17:52] <Sadale> I kind of get why the supervisor were unhappy about that. But still if I were him I wouldn't fire someone over that. That's something that could be solved by just asking nicely. :/
[17:18:13] <MootPoot> The other thing was for some reason they had the boomer mindset

[19:33:09] <MootPoot> but you said that with regards to calorie counting , not with regards to increasing fat intake
[19:33:28] <Sadale> MootPoot, Actually spacetime is a thing. So if you move fast enough, you'd age slower than other people. So the idea is to ask your parents to give birth to an imouto. Then you'd move at speed of light until your imouto had aged enough to turn into an onee-san

[21:39:14] <Nanobot> I'm running an update across my media database to change the way tags are stored/indexed, hoping to make certain queries (searching conditions on multiple tags at once) scale better. Before, if you had a tag attached to 1,000 media items, and another tag attached to 100,000 media items, and you wanted to find media items that have both tags, PostgreSQL would effectively query each tag separately and then merge the result, because it's cheaper than finding 
[21:39:15] <Nanobot> the 1,000 matches and doing random lookup on each one. With the new structure, I'm hoping to change that, so each possible match will have all its tags (and their properties) readily available for any further filtering.
[21:39:40] <Nanobot> I have no idea how long the update will take to run, but a few hours wouldn't surprise me.
[21:41:21] <Nanobot> I planned to run it overnight, but it aborted because I didn't properly coalesce nulls for the non-nullable field.
