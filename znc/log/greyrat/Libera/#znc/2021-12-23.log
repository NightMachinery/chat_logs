[00:02:17] <gordonfish> Khaytsus: Maybe my confusion is from having been under the impression that my use case (have multiple clients connected to the ZNC server) was the typical one, that should any client lose it's connection, it would get what it had missed from the ZNC server which saves messages (channel, PM, etc.)
[00:02:43] <Khaytsus> I'm not sure how to explain it any differently.
[00:02:46] <Khaytsus> gordonfish: Because that's the default.  See the URL if you want to do it differently.
[00:03:50] <gordonfish> What is the default though? That's what isn't clear. Do you mean that if any of multiple connected cliends disconencts and later reconnects, it should be getting what that client had missed?
[00:07:49] *** Quits: samgranieri (~samgranie@user/samgranieri) (Quit: samgranieri)
[00:10:04] <gordonfish> Do I understand that correctly?
[00:10:26] <Khaytsus> by default, znc replays lines when all clients are disconnected.  Don't recall the numbers, maybe 50 per channel 500 total, something like that, don't recall.  But by default it just does it.
[00:10:59] *** Joins: samgranieri (~samgranie@user/samgranieri)
[00:11:17] <gordonfish> It would really help to know what I should check exactly. All the channels I have saved in the ZNC web interface had "Save to config", "Auto clear chan buffer", and "Enabled" checked.
[00:13:41] <gordonfish> Khaytsus: So default is all clients? Is it possible to be per-client? So if one client (e.g., on my phone) gets disconnected, while, say, my desktop remains connected, is it possible for the disconnected one to get replayed when it reconnects? (And vice-versa, should the desktop one disconnect while the mobile one is still working (e.g., out and about using cellular data) ?
[00:14:16] <gordonfish> Under "Global Settings" I have "playback" checked.
[00:14:32] <gordonfish> "Maximum Buffer Size" is 1000
[00:14:45] <Khaytsus> And if you need it to play back when using [[Multiple_clients]]  ...

[02:43:56] <MetaNova> <gordonfish> What is the default though?
[02:44:30] <MetaNova> gordonfish: the default is that NO BUFFER IS GENERATED so long as at least one client remains connected and AutoClearChanBuffer is enabled. which is the default.
[02:45:32] <MetaNova> in order to make more than one client reliably see scrollback while/after another client is/was connected, you need "persistent buffers" -- persistent buffers are AutoClearChanBuffer and AutoClearQueryBuffer set FALSE
[02:45:49] <MetaNova> that's the core tl;dr
[02:46:19] <MetaNova> https://wiki.znc.in/Multiple_clients goes over more re: more than one client and buffer preservation/repeated displaying
[02:46:34] <gordonfish> MetaNova: Ah I see. Right now I just built and installed clientbuffer.so (from latest git (https://github.com/CyberShadow/znc-clientbuffer)) and I did disable those aitp clear buffer options in "Your Settings" for channel and query
[02:47:03] <MetaNova> (AutoClear*Buffer when TRUE means no buffer is generated unless /all/ clients are disconnected, and then WHEN A CLIENT CONNECTS the buffer (if one exists) is displayed, then purged)
[02:47:32] <gordonfish> Do you know if I also need to go channel by channel and also disable the auto clear on each one too, or does changing it in "Your Settings" override that?
[02:47:33] <MetaNova> https://wiki.znc.in/Multiple_clients#Full_overview steps 1 through 5 should fix everything for you
[02:47:40] <MetaNova> gordonfish: no
[02:47:45] <MetaNova> do not toggle those channel variables
[02:48:21] <MetaNova> channel variables, if left untouched, inherit whatever the relative User variable equivalents are
[02:48:26] <gordonfish> Ok just checked some channels from the list and it's unchecked on all the ones I looked at
[02:48:43] <gordonfish> MetaNova: I suspected as much
[02:49:17] <MetaNova> gordonfish: to reset channels to vanilla "I will reflect whatever the User variables are set to" just part all channels and rejoin them
[02:49:27] <MetaNova> then, obviously, don't touch the channel variables
[02:49:41] <MetaNova> (this system also affects things like BufferSize
[02:49:42] <MetaNova> )_
[02:49:48] <gordonfish> I have steps 2 and 3 done now, though I skipped one, which is to add route_replies, but I would rather see replies mirrored to each client I have connected.
[02:49:59] <gordonfish> *skipped step 1
[02:50:01] <MetaNova> gordonfish: that is not what that step is for.
[02:50:24] <MetaNova> gordonfish: step 1 is to prevent all clients being spammed with output which is NOT INTENDED for the client to see
[02:50:37] <gordonfish> Oh
[02:50:40] <MetaNova> such as the WHO output per channel, which clients /do/ regularly request on their own
[02:50:45] <MetaNova> and silently eat the results
[02:50:47] <gordonfish> Must have missed read something then, thanks
[02:50:53] <MetaNova> (typical client behavior)
[02:50:58] <gordonfish> Right
[02:51:40] <MetaNova> to be fair I could reword that to be a bit more clear
[02:51:53] <MetaNova> or, at least, emphasized better

[03:10:18] <MetaNova> which certificate?
[03:11:08] <eletrotupi> one I have obtained for my bouncer domain

[03:13:44] <eletrotupi> and placed on ~/.znc
[03:14:15] <MetaNova> private + public is insufficient

[03:20:04] <eletrotupi> and it connected
[03:20:24] <eletrotupi> hm, maybe uacme saves the fullchain

[03:27:24] <MetaNova> assuming you run this on the same machine ZNC is located on, and that ZNC is running, and that your cert is being attempted to be used, and you're listening on both localhost as well as port 12345
[03:27:28] <MetaNova> adjust as needed, obviously
[03:27:40] <MetaNova> but that should tell you whether the cert is determined to be valid or not
[03:28:41] <MetaNova> if it returns without error then no IRC client should have problems connecting to ZNC with SSL, even the ones which attempt to validate the signage of the cert such as weechat

[03:35:50] <eletrotupi> ok

[03:45:36] <MetaNova> I've seen it done

[03:46:22] <eletrotupi> because, after I added the znc.pem file, and enabled the new port with ssl marked on webadmin
[03:46:30] <eletrotupi> all I've done was follow this guide

[03:46:58] <eletrotupi> I just wanted a way to know that I'm actually connected using SSL
[03:47:08] <eletrotupi> and not gaslighting myself lol 
[03:47:25] <MetaNova> eletrotupi: because the wiki is written in a way that assumes a valid, signed certificate is not used
[03:47:42] <MetaNova> eletrotupi: see the output of: /help irc.server.libera.ssl_fingerprint

[03:47:59] <MetaNova> (replace "libera" with your network name)
[03:48:32] <MetaNova> {snip} escription: fingerprint of certificate which is trusted and accepted for the server; if this option is set, the other checks on certificates are NOT performed (option "ssl_verify")
[03:48:58] <MetaNova> so
[03:49:09] <eletrotupi> yeah
[03:49:12] <eletrotupi> just read that
[03:49:16] <eletrotupi> so, technically
[03:49:21] <MetaNova> you can whitelist it and the validity/signed nature of the cert is utterly irrelevant
[03:49:21] <MetaNova> or
[03:49:23] <eletrotupi> I should be able to remove that option
[03:49:28] <eletrotupi> set to like, ""
[03:49:33] <MetaNova> you can have a signed cert and simply do nothing extra
[03:49:34] <eletrotupi> add a /reconnect

[03:49:43] <eletrotupi> and then if it connects, it's working fine

[09:08:28] <gordonfish> MetaNova: Thanks for all your help, Khaytsus too. I have it working nicely now. Even set up a playback script in my desktop client so it gets only what was missed upon reconnects.

[09:12:59] <gordonfish> But on mobile there is no scripting. As such, is there a simpler way perhaps to get a playback from the time znc last saw an ident? It would be nice on a mobile client, like if it could be set up that way, perhgaps for that specific identifer (as in user@identifier/network:password used when connecting to ZNC) while allowing the identifier my desktop uses to handle it itself (as a client will have a more accurate timestamp of when a client 
[09:12:59] <gordonfish> lost its connection.)

[09:14:04] <gordonfish> Right now it works well enough but will lead to duplication on mobile, though probably not a big deal.
[09:17:23] <gordonfish> If nothing else I suppose I could write my own module, been wanting to take a look at that any how :)
