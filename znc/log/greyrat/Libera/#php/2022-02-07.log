[00:10:31] <malmalmal> Hello. I am trying to understand new lines in the context of PHP. If I create a variable and assign it a text, and when I write this text I hit enter between paragraphs... ¿What kind of ... new line or whatever am I creating there? ¿How can I detect this 'thing' with PHP in order to, for example str_replace it? Thanks
[00:10:49] <malmalmal> When I say "assign it a text" I meant a string.

[00:26:42] <ordos> malmalmal, depends on your platform (Windows vs Mac vs Unix). Usually \r
[00:26:50] <ordos> \r\n or \r or \n in that order
[00:27:09] <ordos> You can use the predefined constant PHP_EOL to determine what it is on current platform

[00:28:04] <da_wunder> I would say that \n is the "usually" there
[00:28:20] <malmalmal> thanks ordos . I am working with a .csv exported from a WordPRess installation. The csv contains, well, field data from posts. Some of this data, text data, contains... visually... new lines, when I open the csv.
[00:29:02] <da_wunder> malmalmal: so how are you actually working with that csv file?
[00:29:06] <stenno> mac doesn't really use \r anymore for a very long time
[00:29:18] <malmalmal> I turn the csv into a php array programatically
[00:29:26] <da_wunder> malmalmal: share some code, so that we can actually see what you're doing
[00:29:32] <ordos> stenno, good to know (evidently I don't use Mac either ;-) )
[00:29:47] <malmalmal> da_wunder: lots of moving pieces
[00:30:26] <stenno> are you using str_getcsv?
[00:30:44] <da_wunder> malmalmal: so share that part where you're reading that CSV and the part that you've some issues - should not be so hard
[00:30:45] <malmalmal> just a second...
[00:31:20] <malmalmal> This is the method that turns csv into array https://pastebin.com/fR6KmRZB
[00:31:51] <da_wunder> or just use some library to handle that like https://github.com/box/spout
[00:31:52] <malmalmal> I'd say it does a good job with it. new line *seem* to be preserved, at least when dumping the array.
[00:32:02] <stenno> love the BOM special case lol
[00:32:08] <ordos> was just wondering about that
[00:32:29] <stenno> hmm actually thats not BOM
[00:33:15] <da_wunder> I would really recommend to use library like that box/spout for that
[00:33:54] <malmalmal> I appreciate the reccomendation, but this part does seem to work as expected
[00:33:55] <ordos> stenno, it isn't?
[00:34:09] <malmalmal> My doubt lays somewhere else
[00:34:10] <ordos> utf8 BOM I mean
[00:34:36] <stenno> \xfe\xff is bom
[00:34:52] <ordos> xef xbb xbf
[00:34:52] <da_wunder> malmalmal: so if that part is working as expected - where is your actual problem then?
[00:35:57] <malmalmal> What I do with the array is assigning some of its entries to variables, then use Kirby CMS methods to create a 'page' and stick this variables into this page's different fields. My problem is understanding how to deal with the new lines found both in the csv cells and, then, in the array entries.
[00:36:19] <malmalmal> ...so I can properly translate them to the format the corresponding page's field needs
[00:36:51] <malmalmal> What I believe I need to do is turning new lines into paragraphs, so to say.
[00:36:54] <stenno> ordos: you are right
[00:37:07] <da_wunder> nl2br ?
[00:37:21] <malmalmal> but that does nl to br, not nl to p, right ?
[00:37:28] <stenno> \xfe\xff is utf-16, \xfe\xbb\xbf is utf-8 as you said

[00:38:20] <stenno> as the kids say nowadays
[00:38:33] <malmalmal> yeah, da_wunder  nl -> br
[00:38:51] <da_wunder> if you want it to make "foo\bar" to "<p>foo</p><p>bar</p>" instead of "foo<br/>bar" then you need some regex to do that

[02:31:48] <vms14> thanks for the advice btw, it's a good advice
[02:31:54] <Blondie101010> why would you need to use both?
[02:32:05] <Blondie101010> that would definitely be a red flag
[02:32:41] <vms14> Blondie101010: I've never been working as a programmer but I've heard I won't see marvels there
[02:33:21] <vms14> for what I hear it's more likely mysqli will be used instead and I'll find stuff like sql injection xD
[02:33:29] <Blondie101010> you should start by learning how to do thing properly
[02:33:34] <Nekomander> vms14, there is not a lot to learn frankly. What I mean to say is, you do not have to memorize every function in PHP, and you do not need to memorize every detail about each function available in PHP.
[02:33:52] <Blondie101010> then after a few years of experience, you can start to take small contracts that will improve the customer's code base

[02:34:18] <vms14> no, just wanted to use mysqli at least once, even free hostings provide pdo
[02:34:42] <vms14> I've read mysqli is shit some time ago
[02:35:01] <vms14> don't know why, but I remember to had a look at pdo and found it nicer
[02:35:09] <Blondie101010> you sound like you should learn to use better judgment!
[02:35:17] <Nekomander> "I do not carry such information in my mind since it is readily available in books. The value of a college education is not the learning of many facts but the training of the mind to think." — Albert Einstein
[02:35:27] <Blondie101010> PDO has a simpler API and we recommend you use it
[02:35:49] <vms14> yes, I'll start using it once I finish this
[02:36:20] <vms14> actually I would like to make something "portable" that uses mysqli or pdo depending on what is there
[02:36:32] <Nekomander> So the point is, you can get by just knowing the php Syntax. All the "readily available in books" will be Google.com and php.net/documentations.
[02:36:33] <Blondie101010> nope
[02:36:36] <Blondie101010> that's just bad
[02:36:44] <Blondie101010> you use mysqli if you need to
[02:36:58] <Blondie101010> like if that's what's already in use, or they have very specific requirements for it
[02:37:22] <vms14> Blondie101010: if for example want to make a php script that works unchanged on most hostings, there is not a "clean" way to use pdo or mysqli just by looking if they're there?
[02:37:29] <Blondie101010> don't write code expecting the rest of the world to use it...  it won't happen!
[02:37:33] <Blondie101010> you'll just be making crap

[02:37:45] <vms14> yes, I'll just forget about mysqli and let it die
[02:37:53] <Blondie101010> it won't die
[02:38:03] <Blondie101010> it has its use and a lot of existing code uses it

[02:44:15] <vms14> I don't like too much the official docs of php
[02:44:32] <vms14> usually user provided comments with examples explain better
[02:44:43] <BadAdviceCat> vms14, if I were asked what is more important to learn about, I would say "Learn some software design principles". Then with that knowledge, you would be able to write modular code where you focus on just the requirements of what the software needs, and then, on the condition that Becomes necessary, you can then write a module, plug it into the code and it would function just the same way without having to edit a lot of the existing code.
[02:45:24] <BadAdviceCat> vms14, you should really learn to like the PHP documents. What is it that you do not like about it?
[02:45:54] <vms14> it's more like a reference manual and I want some tutorials
[02:46:51] <vms14> about the advice, first I have to get familiar with php, as I have to google whatever I want to do atm. Need to learn about oop and namespaces and alike
[02:47:18] <vms14> Once I learn oop I can model the software using it and it get's a bit better
[02:48:04] <vms14> but about what to learn in general programming I'm interested a lot in bottom up programming and I'd like to improve my functional programming skills
[02:49:57] <BadAdviceCat> vms14, 1. Learn the syntax. 2. Improve your google-fu capabilities (no, I don't mean the awful way, I am talking about the actually better way). 3. Understand the reference manual better and what to look for. 4. Then learn the software design principles.
[02:50:25] <vms14> I find almost no documentation about bottom up programming and have a vague definition and a little understanding, but I know it resonates with functional programming and specially with lisp macros. It's more like building tiny pieces until the language understands the program, and you have a layer which is more like an extension of the language and a little program written on top
[02:50:53] <vms14> Yes, the best I can do is to get used to the official doc
[02:51:48] <vms14> Idk how much fp friendly is php
[02:51:54] <BadAdviceCat> Tutorials are nice sometimes, but the worst that can happen is to become a copy-paste coder who goes to tutorials and copy everything without understanding what each line of code do and then finish a job with partially "working" code.
[02:51:59] <vms14> do you write functional code in php?
[02:52:21] <vms14> I usually read books, but books have 1000 pages and I never finish them
[02:52:44] <vms14> so I started by making a todo app and searching at google the functions I need xD
[02:53:31] <vms14> BadAdviceCat: i don't like when I don't understand something
[02:53:47] <BadAdviceCat> vms14, no. My code is not going to only be 1 paradigm or another. I use functional, oop and procedural and such in a Combination.
[02:53:55] <vms14> so I'll never copypaste a line of code I don't understand unless I'm forced to do it
[02:54:11] <BadAdviceCat> vms14, https://ibb.co/rpTyJvP here, you might find this useful.
[02:54:26] <vms14> oh has lambdas and closures
[02:55:02] <BadAdviceCat> As long as you place the right types of data into the right arguments, you can drastically reduce errors in your code.
[02:55:38] <vms14> BadAdviceCat: yes, but that's a reference manual indeed, my issue is when I want to do X thing but I don't know which of the listed functions does
[02:56:05] <vms14> and php has some weird names for functions, the weirdest maybe explode and implode for split and join
[02:56:06] <BadAdviceCat> https://ibb.co/g6w57N8 also, this too.
[02:57:03] <vms14> but I somehow like php
[02:57:48] <vms14> It feels simple, like it will do what I need without getting in my way
[02:58:50] <BadAdviceCat> Try not to treat PHP like LISP. It has similarities.
[03:00:13] <BadAdviceCat> Oh and as for googling error messages and solving problems. This is the correct way on how to use google: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OX-mns8UJw
[03:00:47] <vms14> I'll start learning about php oop
[03:01:30] <BadAdviceCat> Do you by any chance write a checklist for software requirements? Or use any flow charts?
[03:01:53] <vms14> never
[03:02:25] <vms14> I mostly do a bunch of tests that eventually work and end being the program
[03:02:46] <vms14> because I'm usually doing it for the first line and learning while doing it
[03:04:03] <vms14> I never did "serious" programming
[03:04:27] <vms14> at most my programs have 1000 lines of code
[03:05:32] <vms14> but lines are nothing as usually the more you learn about something the shorter your code is, because you see patterns and reduce them or avoid doing unnecessary stuff you did before
[03:08:30] <BadAdviceCat> I've always been more of the Top-down/waterfall approach user when it comes to writing projects.

[03:20:01] <Blondie101010> you need to understand basic methodologies before you can work anywhere

[03:20:16] <vms14> php 8.1
[03:20:21] <vms14> in netbsd
[03:20:39] <vms14> I like the fact variables inside a function are local by default
[03:20:58] <vms14> and you won't access a global unless you explicitly say so
[03:21:21] <BadAdviceCat> vms14, How far would you say you are at understanding this? https://www.php.net/manual/en/langref.php - You understand Types, including boolean, integer? Variables? Constants? How about Control Structures?
[03:21:54] <vms14> and saw that you can start a loop in php with php tags, and put html, then end the loop with another php tag, and the html gets printed for every iteration
[03:22:01] <BadAdviceCat> Functions? Functions -> Returning values?  Classes and Objects? The Basics for Classes and Objects?
[03:22:31] <BadAdviceCat> I like to use alternate syntax, when my PHP involves HTML in between for that control structure.

[03:32:36] <BadAdviceCat> The final end tat is not necessary, and the reason is explained here: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phptags.php
[03:33:03] <BadAdviceCat> tag*
[03:35:58] <vms14> I was reading this just now
[03:36:22] <vms14> and wanted to ask if I should get used to not put the end tag
[03:36:55] <__adrian> !+?>
[03:36:55] <php-bot> The closing php tag `?>` is not for ending scripts; rather, it's for _beginning_ literal output.   it's like `echo "anything and everything until the next <?php tag";`  probably not what you meant.
[03:37:04] <__adrian> depends on what you want
[03:37:06] <vms14> as an extra blank outputted as html is ignored and idk if not putting it could let to some troubles
[03:37:17] <__adrian> it certainly can  ;)
[03:37:30] <vms14> so then better to just put it
[03:37:36] <__adrian> no, referring to the opposite
[03:37:54] <vms14> ah, html interpreting stuff
[03:37:54] <__adrian> ?> can "cause troubles" if you don't want output but then suddenly do
[03:38:21] <__adrian> when you start output, that's when php sends headers
[03:39:06] <vms14> __adrian: but a blank line would trigger output
[03:39:27] <__adrian> that's the most common problem people run into
[03:39:51] <__adrian> an unexpected  ?>\n\n  followed by a later  header(...)  doesn't work
[03:39:51] <vms14> then I won't put it
[03:40:04] <__adrian> only use it when you want output  :)
[03:40:17] <vms14> thanks, I now really understand why should or shouldn't put it
[03:40:56] <vms14> I think I would never realize a blank line would trigger php sending headers
[03:41:31] <__adrian> beginners tend to think ofphp as "webpages with php in the middle"
[03:41:34] <vms14> well i should
[03:41:51] <__adrian> they're very much not. they're php scripts that might have html output.
[03:42:20] <vms14> my goal atm as I want to learn php is to abuse php even when I don't have to
[03:42:35] <vms14> which means I'll make html generators in php xD
[03:42:54] <__adrian> php is well suited to making html
[03:43:06] <__adrian> my point is, it's _not_ html. not even the plain html parts.
[03:43:36] <__adrian> the whole thing is a php script. some of it is plain text output that will eventually be parsed by a browser and become html.

[03:59:42] <__adrian> i guess. depends on what tools you want to be able to parse it. gitter was a sincere suggestion - phpdoc has had many incarnations and it's hard to track what is, and on top of it, what's actually current+supported
[04:02:58] <lembron> well shapes is not it :D that takes those as literal ['int'] :D

[16:17:11] <Kadigan_> Hey. Is there a way to exclude specific .php files from auto_prepend_file? I'm using .user.ini for this.
[16:18:44] <AllenJB> I don't believe so. For web requests you could use different php-fpm pools. For commandline, specify a different php.ini as part of the command.
[16:19:41] <AllenJB> What's your use case? auto_prepend_file is a rarely used feature - there's usually better methods to achieve what you want
[16:20:12] <BadAdviceCat> Kadigan_, if this is a website that you own and control, it's generally better to use `require` to apply code before many of your php scripts run.
[16:20:17] <Blondie101010> wanting to prevent it sounds like a bad requirement though
[16:20:30] <Kadigan_> My use case is that a WordPress plugin (Wordfence) registers its application firewall via auto_prepend_file, and I need a simple script excluded on a shared hosting env.
[16:21:06] <Kadigan_> For now, I modified the "loader" it uses to skip if the filename matches. I was hoping for a more elegant solution.
[16:27:43] *** Joins: LdizL (~LdizL@d24-150-215-30.home.cgocable.net)
[16:34:07] <lembron> Kadigan_ you do shared hosting and want to stop people from prepending wordfence or what you mean? - turn of the htaccess option?
[16:35:18] <Kadigan_> lembron: no, I'm using shared hosting (though it seems the env options are per account), I'm using a WP plugin that registers itself as an application firewall through auto_prepend_file, and I want to NOT auto-prepend it for a specific file.
[16:36:17] <lembron> Kadigan_ where does it enable the prepend then? pretty sure you can wrap that in <files> and there like in htaccess
[16:36:43] <Kadigan_> I can't use .htaccess - I think it runs on FPM now, any php_value directive results in a 500. I'm using .user.ini for this.

[16:37:18] *** Joins: hh (~g@37.214.30.123)
[16:38:39] <BadAdviceCat> Kadigan_, unrelated: I wouldn't use a shared hosting in the first place because then what you want to do becomes limited to what the hosting service allows. I typically go for VPS where you have more control. Such as setting up multiple pools in FPM ,per-website rules/configs.
[16:38:59] <lembron> good old mod_php would allow in apache.conf - but with fpm and it set in ini it seems a bit of a lost fight indeed :/ - guess ya could run 2 fpms (bit ugly for sure)
[16:39:00] <Kadigan_> Yeah, I know. The difference though is 4-6x the price.
[16:39:15] <Kadigan_> (shared vs vps)
[16:39:25] <BadAdviceCat> Kadigan_, really? Are you paying $1/mo for web hosting?
[16:40:49] <lembron> Kadigan_ when you say "modified the loader" - as in, edited some wo-content/plugins/bla/... script? - shouldnt do that, they get wiped (on updates) and should be able to checksum-verify -- so if you should likely add your own loader script and use that instead
[16:41:45] <Kadigan_> lembron: it's a file it places directly on the root, and it basically says "if file_exists /wp-content/plugins/wordfence/waf/bootstrap then run that".
[16:41:55] <Kadigan_> I added "if the file isn't this.filename AND ..."
[16:42:15] <Slartibart> So what's the deal when using PHP8 and composer? Composer asks for openssl, 'php -i' says 'OpenSSL support => disabled (install ext/openssl)'. But when I try to rebuild PHP 8 with '--with-pear' added I still don't get any pecl or anything to install it with.
[16:43:16] <lembron> Kadigan_ so this file is NOT part of the actual plugin (directly) --- but, say written out (file_put_contents or whatever) from the installer of the plugin? - guess then its a tad safer to edit, but i would still add my whole "own one" (as you are the one to controll the ini value you can just whack yours in and fine is)
[16:43:50] <Kadigan_> lembron: it does detect previous entries from auto_prepend_file and adds them to this file on install, so I assume it's safe to edit.
[16:43:50] <BadAdviceCat> Slartibart, why are you building PHP in the first place? What does pear have to do with openssl?
[16:44:39] <Kadigan_> lembron: I suppose you're right - I *could* detect if wordfence-waf.php is in place and run that.
[16:46:14] <lembron> Kadigan_ hm if it "learns" from the current env and writes that in, certainly makes it sound like a "onetime" task a bit more yea... ((them reimporting from that file to regenerate a new one on upgrades seems a bit far fetched :D)) -- think id make it depending on "how bad it is if it gets broken" :D
[16:46:22] <Naktibalda> Slartibart: if you are building PHP, build it with --with-openssl option
[16:53:30] <Slartibart> Naktibalda: I am, '--with-openssl=/usr'. No errors that I can see, but still I get that openssl support is disabled.

[22:21:29] <znf> I'm having a weird issue with a more complicated setup and I'm not sure where to start at
[22:21:53] <znf> Got a client using Wordpress on a cPanel server with LiteSpeed
[22:22:14] <znf> Every now and then, "everything" php will randomly stop working on his account
[22:22:38] <znf> the logs will only show stuff like: zend_mm_heap corrupted
[22:22:42] <znf> free(): invalid pointer
[22:23:23] <znf> To "fix" it, it's enough to killall -u user -9 lsphp
[22:23:48] <znf> I was reading this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2247977/what-does-zend-mm-heap-corrupted-mean
[22:24:13] <znf> But there's lots of stuff that may or may not work I guess (hence why I'm not sure where to start at)

[22:45:01] <vms14> yet the function should have another name, but I ask if there is a shorter way to do it, since it seems I'm traversing two arrays (3 with the arguments)

[22:53:44] <Albright> `fn ($x)=>isset($_REQUEST[$x])` - Is that syntax valid in PHP?
[22:54:06] <vms14> I think I'll change it for a loop that stops if finds isset is false
[22:54:08] <stenno> sounds good?
[22:54:16] <vms14> Albright: they're arrow functions
[22:54:19] <stenno> why shouldn't it be?
[22:54:25] <vms14> fn (signature) => expr
[22:54:30] <Albright> What, in English, are you trying to do? See if an array contains a value?
[22:55:12] <vms14> Albright: it turns that the most stuff I'll do with php is get input and work with a db
[22:55:32] <vms14> so I'll try to make little utilities like this one
[22:55:34] <Albright> Yes, that's like 80% of web development
[22:56:15] <stenno> in germany, IT was called EDV - 'electronic data handling'
[22:56:26] <Albright> Oh, you want to see if $_REQUEST contains keys for all of the values sent to has_arguments()?
[22:56:33] <vms14>  has_arguments('name','user','pwd') I want it as a shorthand for if(isset($_REQUEST('name')...
[22:56:43] <vms14> yes, the name is shit
[22:56:47] <vms14> sorry
[22:57:28] <vms14> but it's likely another php function would do what I'm trying
[22:57:48] <Albright> return count(array_diff($args, array_keys($_REQUEST))) === 0
[22:58:10] <Albright> array_diff($a, $b) will return an array containing all of the values of $a which are not in $b
[22:58:17] <vms14> tnx
[22:58:24] <vms14> I'll play with array_diff
[22:58:46] <vms14> oh, u're using array_keys
[22:58:48] <Albright> Internally it's still doing loops but at least they're not at the PHP level
[22:59:16] <vms14> yes, I think I'll just make a loop and stop when found a false
[22:59:43] <vms14> at leaast if a false value is found early would save space, and would only traverse it once

[23:17:31] <TML> that sounds like a horrible idea
[23:17:44] <TML> you're adding so many unrelated factors by going with ab
[23:22:06] <vms14> so you guys use xdebug?
[23:22:10] <vms14> do*
[23:22:35] <da_wunder> yes, for debugging - not for benchmarking
[23:23:03] <TML> vms14: No, but I'm part of the Patreon
[23:23:36] <vms14> da_wunder: it's worth the time I suppose
[23:24:08] <vms14> how many 'echo' lines did you avoid?
[23:24:28] <TML> xdebug is a tool I think "should" exist, whether or not I actually leverage it myself
[23:24:57] <da_wunder> vms14: it really depends, eg. if you use Symfony (as I do) I could just add `dump($something);` to my code and check my profiler what is that
[23:25:30] <da_wunder> vms14: but still I use xdebug to debug things that are harder to test with just that dump function
[23:25:56] <Albright> I use xdebug and sponsor it on GitHub. Unfortunately my GDB client is currently broken… they're supposed to be adding support to it to Nova soon. Can't wait for that.

[23:26:38] <vms14> webgrind
[23:26:44] <da_wunder> xdebug is really good tool, that you should use _if_ you want to use it
[23:27:02] <vms14> https://github.com/jokkedk/webgrind
[23:28:14] <Albright> Ah… profiling and bechmarking are not quite the same thing.
[23:28:48] <da_wunder> and for profiling I would recommend you to use that blackfire.io
