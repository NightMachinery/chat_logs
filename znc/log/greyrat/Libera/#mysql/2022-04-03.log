[02:54:56] <lembron> hi, large mysql-import with like 8h of index-crunching spread over it, one of that in a 4h-block - currently it creates a table, puts data in, indexes, then the next - can one move that indexing "to the background"? - like i still want to wait for them all to show up before its "done", but why cant i continue to write the next table while that crunching is going on...

[04:39:57] <shailangsa> does anybody know whether "CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE `tmptable1` AS SELECT * FROM `user_table` ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1" and "CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE `tmptable1` SELECT * FROM `user_table` ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1" are the same?
[04:41:11] <shailangsa> the difference being AS?
[04:43:27] <Xgc> shailangsa: [AS] query_expression   .. The [ ] means it's optional.
[04:43:42] <Xgc> shailangsa: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table.html
[04:44:10] <Xgc> shailangsa: No difference.
[04:44:42] <Xgc> No logical difference.
[05:04:28] <thumbs> lembron: depends on how your import file is structured
[05:06:01] <lembron> oh yea i already kinda moved on :P - found there is indeed threading in "mysqlimport" - but only when given multiple files -- and while i DO already have "multiple files", those are not complete (my header&footer are separate .sql-files as I produce that whole thing from unpacking a 3rd-party dump that i then cut up with csplitting :D)
[05:06:24] <lembron> so bash it is =)

[07:12:09] <pie_> of course when youre 5 aliases deep i guess it gets harder, but then using explicit join syntax would have the same problem?

[08:43:57] <Xgc> pie_: Try using USING in a FROM clause with more than two table references.
[08:45:01] <Xgc> pie_: In other words, it's ok for the trivial case: t1 JOIN t2 ..., but if you also have JOIN t3 ...  good luck when all 3 tables have that matching column name.
[08:45:53] <pie_> but...1) join is binary? 2) how does that even work at all of there is a collision
[08:47:50] <Xgc> pie_: Exactly. It's usable in only the most trivial cases.
[08:49:29] <Xgc> pie_: It does appear to work if you're lucky and only two tables have that column.  But it will do some less than expected things in some cases.  Here: https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=mysql_8.0&fiddle=b558d31ffa4c6092d73152014924ebe7
[08:50:29] <Xgc> pie_: Notice the last case, where we normally expect test2 and test3 to be the targets of the last JOIN, in a sense.  But the common column (id) is found in test1 and test3 only.
[08:51:43] <Xgc> pie_: Sorry. I was playing with the test.  The first query should be this: https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=mysql_8.0&fiddle=9ca80a056b07dd460a8fe32ccfc4d17b
[08:52:02] <Xgc> Notice the ambiguous error.,
[08:52:46] <Xgc> pie_: USING has some odd behavior that makes it one of the options to avoid, usually.
[08:54:12] <Xgc> NATERAL JOIN is still one of the worst in terms of practical usage.  Avoid it.
