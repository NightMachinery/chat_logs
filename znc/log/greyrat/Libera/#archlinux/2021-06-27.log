[02:14:19] <jkhsjdhjs> 3>In order to change the time systemd will wait for a device to be available, the option x-systemd.device-timeout (see systemd.mount(5)) can be set in fstab for said device.

[02:15:09] <jkhsjdhjs> Isn't that wrong? I mean, at this point in time the root device is still locked, so /etc/fstab can't be read unless it is also part of the initramfs, which I think isn't described anywhere in this article.

[02:35:22] <Jarcode> alright now I'm genuinely confused, what _actually_ happens if a disk is mounted by host & guest?
[02:35:40] <Jarcode> because I couldn't get EFISTUB to work with QEMU (not retaining boot entries)
[02:35:58] <Jarcode> but I can boot the kernel directly through QEMU if I just mount the partition on the host
[02:36:26] <Jarcode> is it safe to just mount it on the host as read-only?

[02:39:08] <Jarcode> because obviously it is unsafe to have two rw mounts on the same device: there's literally two instances of the ext4 driver accessing this device
[02:39:41] <Jarcode> like if I write a file on host it's not going to be "atomic" across instances
[02:39:50] <Jarcode> and could totally break the state of the driver, right?

[03:05:35] <Hello71> mount -o ro is interpreted by some filesystems as "prevent opening and writing files"
[03:05:46] <Hello71> which is the main way to write but not the only way

[03:06:52] <Hello71> that's reasonably easy to disable in code, but harder is doing the journal replay in memory

[14:30:52] <Shapeshifter> Something technical I'm wondering about. Whenever an IO device is "temporarily unavailable", like say, a hard drive spinning up, file managers, shells etc. all just "freeze". I know it's because the resource is pending, but doesn't linux have a better mechanism to deal with this? It appears that every single application has to be implemented "correctly" for this lag to be incorporated. Take 
[14:30:58] <Shapeshifter> thunar, for example. It just freezes. Why wouldn't the developers have implemented a worker thread the show a loading animation and allow me to navigate somewhere else in the meantime?
[14:31:04] <Shapeshifter> seems like such a basic feature that I would consider it a bug. Same goes for bash, too.
[14:31:45] <Shapeshifter> try to tab-complete a slow IO resource and you're stuck, possibly forever if the resource doesn't become available.

[14:56:19] <Shapeshifter> I'm more concerned with the fact that this operation isn't provided on the OS level. Every single application has to implement this threaded operation. Wouldn't it be more sensible if the OS provided an event-based interface? I.e. 1) Client wants to access a resource - this operation completes synchronously immediately. 2) The OS fetches the resource, it might take a long time. 3) When the 
[14:56:25] <Shapeshifter> resource is available, the client receives a Signal and can synchronously, immediately access it through the OS. No client-side threading necessary.

[14:58:11] <demonicmaniac> it might make sense for the toolkits themselves to provide something like that
[14:58:23] <MacGyver> A lot of I/O calls allow non-blocking operation, telling you the resource is unavailable.
[14:58:41] <MacGyver> But there's no concept of joining a queue for a resource on the OS-level, afaik.

[15:00:14] <MacGyver> The OS can't know that an sshfs-mount has gone stale, for example.
[15:00:15] <demonicmaniac> bash tab completion is also probably the worst possible example you cannot tab complete what isn't there and you hit tab to complete what else do you want to do in that bash instance? any typing or doing anything would override the completion
[15:01:07] <sensille> yeah, i don't see how the OS could generally handle these situation except informing the process. the process has to decide how to properly handle the situation
[15:01:09] <MacGyver> What you're effectively asking for is an async promise/future model built into the OS itself.
[15:02:05] <Shapeshifter> MacGyver: that's right.
[15:02:08] <MacGyver> Which honestly isn't the worst idea ever, but ... languages already have this for I/O.
[15:02:28] <MacGyver> And I'm not sure whether the added complexity in the kernel would be worth it.
[15:02:35] <Shapeshifter> Yeah, it would seem a contemporary advancement, since promises/futures are a great idea.

[20:09:38] <raster> so imho it's also inaccurate.
[20:09:44] <nimbius> i cant think of a more derogatory term for people who float through life breaking releases and gingerly logging them in github as if people dont appreciate functional software in a production release.

[20:10:48] <nimbius> raster: its broken on fedora too, and it never worked on RH7.9 or 8.1/2
[20:10:57] <wez> raster: Fedora's just get blown off your head
[20:11:11] <raster> so complaining about breakages is like complaining it hurts after you shot your own foot with a shotgun.
[20:12:43] <nimbius> my point is this was a production release of runc that literally got shipped with the knowledge that it would only ever work if you nerfed seccomp.json and this wasnt documented until after the fact in a shady github issue.

[21:52:58] <tatsumaru> hey guys, is it possible to run only a specific game in X while in a wayland session?
[21:53:16] <Foxboron> earnestly: I don't know why anyone runs that script
[21:53:40] <Foxboron> earnestly: I'm not sure if you have seen that I have written secure boot tooling from scratch in Go :p
[21:53:46] <earnestly> Would it be better if the entire section is removed?
[21:53:53] <Foxboron> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[21:54:11] <Foxboron> I'm erring on having mkinitcpio having hook or pre/post actions
[21:54:35] <Foxboron> dracut has builtin support for sbsign, but I'd like to have something more flexbile with mkinitcpio. But it's just a poorly reasoned thought
[21:54:35] <MrElendig> tatsumaru: if the game doesn't support wayland it will automagically be run in xwayland
[21:54:45] <earnestly> I'll assume it's correct then, you didn't address the question but at least there will no longer be an ACE

[21:54:59] <Foxboron> earnestly: It seems correct, but I never doubted that in the first place :p
[21:55:01] <johnnyapol> tatsumaru:usually different GUI frameworks (sdl, gtk, etc) have environment variables that dictate whether or not wayland is used if you're trying to run an app that supports wayland in x. worst case scenario, you can use flatpak and deny perms to the app to access the wayland server which would force it to run inX
[21:55:12] <tatsumaru> MrElendig the game crashes in wayland, but runs fine under gnome x.
[21:55:12] <Foxboron> earnestly: https://github.com/Foxboron/sbctl :p
[21:55:42] <tatsumaru> so it seems that it doesn't switch automatically
[21:56:55] <tatsumaru> However since I use wayland for everything else I was wondering if there was  a way to play it without signing out of the wayland session

[22:00:01] <tatsumaru> MrElendig also if I start the game from terminal with the 'SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland' it crashes even before the main menu, so I am thinking that somehow without this option wayland isn't requested until the level is loaded or something like that.

[23:29:21] <grawity> if you mean 870 evo then yeah, 860 seems fine though
[23:30:03] <b-rex> i've only had 1 ssd fail on me and it was my fault for not addressing a thermal issue early enough
[23:30:54] <MrElendig> 1tb 860 evo is quite a bit more expensive than eg the wd550 
[23:31:07] <MrElendig> sn550*
[23:31:35] <MrElendig> 550 is ramless to be fair, but for most use that doesn't matter in practice for it
