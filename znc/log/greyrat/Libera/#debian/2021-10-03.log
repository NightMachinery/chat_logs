[06:09:51] <tjcarter> it shouldn't have created it if that were the case

[06:10:42] <ak4> Debian 11 has been running really well on a new Thinkpad X1 Carbon (gen 9). Fingerprint auth is fine, but I guess I forgot to consider using encryption would prevent fingerprint auth from working on first boot.

[06:36:16] <dpkg> rufus is a tool that can be used to make bootable USB devices under Windows.

Ask me about <hybrid images>, <usb install>, <win32diskimager>.

[06:55:05] <tjcarter> because I'd rather this beastie not cook itself
[06:55:08] <PMT> I just installed a PCI e1000 card in something.
[06:55:29] <PMT> Though when looking to see if I had one, I found a DEC card and a 3com card.
[06:55:43] <tjcarter> really if I had a thin, flat heatsink and a thin, flat fan, it'd make more sense to put it on the back of the card
[06:56:06] <tjcarter> the Voodoo3 chip is die-down on the board.
[06:56:17] <PMT> that seems...flawed.
[06:56:22] <PMT> who thought that was a reasonable design?
[06:56:47] <tjcarter> it's quite a reasonable design, you can use the PCB's ground and power planes to help sink heat.
[06:56:59] <tjcarter> It's just not sufficient, so there's a passive heatsink on the back
[06:57:10] <tjcarter> which was fine when the cards were new, but it's 20 years old now.
[06:57:25] <PMT> oh i see, i thought you just meant "upside down almost flush", not "no heatsink in contact with board"
[06:58:10] <PMT> voodoo3 was old 20 years ago too. :P
[06:58:17] <PMT> not ancient, but not new.
[06:59:40] <tjcarter> ideally I should figure out how to extract those spring pins (I don't know the trick for removing them and I am legally blind so they're a little small … anyway, I should get them out and replace the thermal goop on the heatsink with something more modern and THEN attach a second heatsink to the CPU side of the card with a thin fan to just force some air past it

[15:38:58] <PMT> of course not, you should be using the info pages, they're definitely better in every way except anyone actually wanting to use them.
[15:39:41] <ede> it's just the manpage split on 2 pages

[15:52:00] <ede> `grep | xargs cmd opts` seems to be be the same as `cmd opts $(grep)`, it just blindly appends the lines with s/\n/ / instead of running the command with each line it reads
[15:52:22] <PMT> i mean, yes, that's xargs's whole thing
[15:52:41] <PMT> i think it has flags if you want to do the while read LINE thing instead, but at that point, why are you even using xargs
[15:55:02] <ede> because i don't have the "HOW TO DO X" bible in 24 volumes. i think i'll stay with while read for linewise processing and forget totally that xargs even exists.

[16:13:44] <gigirock> hi all , I have a Seagate Blak Armour NAS 220 , that they gave me as bricked,I googoled some, and find this hacking https://github.com/hn/seagate-blackarmor-nas, I did all the procedures as requested but at the end I have "Ramdisk image is corrupt or invalid" error. You can see what happen at boot: https://paste.debian.net/1214170

[16:15:00] <sussudio> what does this have to do with debian
[16:15:49] <gigirock> sussudio:the hack install debian on the nas, using u-boot and the debian installer
[16:16:34] <sussudio> sounds like you would have to ask whoever made this 'hack'.
[16:16:45] *** Joins: pert (~pert@fsf/member/pert)
[16:17:44] <ede> the first thing i do with a computer is to run a live debian which i know that it works
[16:17:48] <gigirock> sussudio:I already did, but I'm spoken about a 2018 issue.... I hoped to find someone that knows about this error....:)
[16:18:37] <PMT> gigirock: you seem to have posted on the bugtracker 3 days ago about how to fix it
[16:19:19] <gigirock> PMT:are you experienced about this issue ?
[16:19:43] <PMT> no, i'm just remarking that you seem to have posted a bug saying "hey, the internet says i should fix it this way"
[16:20:39] <sussudio> from what i can tell from a google search, this ramdisk image error is caused by users giving wrong parameters to things.
[16:20:54] <sussudio> then my eyes glazed over
[16:22:06] <sussudio> and/or bad hardware...
[16:22:26] <sussudio> gigirock: if this thing was damaged by a power surge or lighting, you may be wasting your time.
[16:24:35] <gigirock> sussudio:no, seems the device was bricked from a wrong upgrade/install, seems no possible to come back to the factory default, but the device answer perfectly to the tools we have from debian to access it

[20:24:52] <nr0q_radio> I've got a debian packaging question .....
[20:24:52] <nr0q_radio> To be included, I know software has to have a generally approved open source license, which what I'm wanting to package is MIT and BSD-3C so not a problem.
[20:24:52] <nr0q_radio> But one package is the main application which is all JavaScript so it's a no-arch package with just the JavaScript stuff.
[20:24:52] <nr0q_radio> The other is the actual executable which despite all my attempts, I can't actually build from scratch, so we just have been repacking the pre-built binaries from upstream. On Fedora, means I had to use COPR repos, what's the procedure for that in Debian and downstream if I want to be in the official stream of things? Thanks

[20:29:26] <pert> nr0q_radio: with very few exceptions (e.g. free firmware, and even that is just because it's been grandfathered in), executables must be built from source. I would even go as far as to say that if it's very painful or impossible to build from source, is it really even free software if it's impractical to modify?
[20:29:41] <pert> Also, I find it very unlikely that upstream builds binaries for all of the architectures Debian aims to support.
[20:30:00] <pert> If you want to ship a pre-built binary, that can only be done in the unofficial non-free section of the archive.
