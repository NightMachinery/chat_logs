[00:28:45] <bfredl> modern python uses strings that either latin-1, UCS-2 or UTF-32, depending on the highest codepoint, but always fixed-length. That is in codepoints. then grapheme clusters came along and made all of them variable-length in any sort of practise :)

I have my dotfiles in a repo,  I symlink it to those to nvim's config directory, and also clone the packer.nvim repo to `site/packer/start/packer.nvim` so it loads automatically. But when I do this, I get errors because I haven't downloaded the plugins yet, but at the same time because there are some errors, packer can't load correctly

[09:09:38] <Soup[m]> Thats sort of a religious question. I personally copied bits and pieces as I found things I wanted to change, rather than copy a configuration wholesale. But it really depends on how you want to approach things re: time, effort, etc.

[16:33:36] <sunjonSenghanBri> someone's brought up textmate grammars before..
[16:33:49] <sunjonSenghanBri> or perhaps I read about it in the early days(for me) of TS
[16:33:53] <clason[m]> it's not a bad suggestion, mind you
[16:34:29] <clason[m]> and probably a strict improvement over vim's own syntax engine
[16:34:57] <bfredl> I mean textmate is a good suggestion, you can just put it forward without needing to invent a lot of stuff about tree-sitter
[16:35:08] <clason[m]> in fact, doing that would be a huge (and welcome) change from Vim's usual NIH policy
[16:35:13] <sunjonSenghanBri> I think grammars and snippets I've noticed folk pointing in TextMate's direction saying "they got that right"
[16:35:15] <dundargoc[m]> Lets do it fellas
[16:35:25] <bfredl> like "textmate grammars is more mature than tree-sitter grammars" _would_ be true

[16:35:31] <bfredl> (for the long tail at least)
[16:35:59] <sunjonSenghanBri> I'm really pleased with how TreeSitter has/is progressing
[16:36:19] <clason[m]> but:
[16:36:19] <clason[m]> 1. textmate grammar _also_ vary wildly in quality (as do vim syntax files)
[16:36:19] <clason[m]> 2. saying "use textmate grammar" doesn't magically implement a textmate grammar syntax _engine_ in Vim (good luck!)
[16:36:19] <clason[m]> 3. tree-sitter does so much more than just highlighting, so that's a bit apples and pears
[16:36:39] <dundargoc[m]> sunjonSenghanBri: But the environment tho...
[16:36:39] <bfredl> true, the best I could find for 2 is GPL3 c++ codes :)
[16:36:56] <clason[m]> eh, just ask Copilot for an implementation
[16:37:04] <bfredl> tru
[16:37:22] <bfredl> it can probably translate the TypeScript implementation in VSCode into top-notch C

[16:39:41] <dundargoc[m]> Anyway, just hypothetically, would textmate be a good fit for neovim?
[16:40:09] <sunjonSenghanBri> I don't think so. That thread is about a design choice Vim has yet to make
[16:40:30] <dundargoc[m]> I know we have treesitter, which is noice, but curious if using textmate would be "better"
[16:40:41] <clason[m]> apples and pears, remember?
[16:40:47] <sunjonSenghanBri> the effort to implement something that duplicates functionality you've spent the last 2 years doing, seems like time that could be invested in something more worthwhile

[17:08:54] <sunjonSenghanBri> It somewhat surprises me that plasticboy's markdown plugin has nearly 4k stars; That the default markdown is insufficient for that many people, for (what I'd consider is a) lesser used syntax if you're a programmer

[17:09:38] <jaawerth[m]> textmate has the benefit of being used by so many things that you can leverage a pretty wide ecosystem of grammars, but the actual parsing and ASTing just has so many benefits
[17:09:46] <bfredl> lpeg is still useful for building simple ad-hoc parsers, so we might embed it into lua stdlib as such

[17:10:32] <jaawerth[m]> yeah lpeg is a member of the "minimalist but extensible FTW" club
[17:10:54] <jaawerth[m]> well I'm sure some people would object to me calling it minimalist but I'm counting it :P
[17:12:11] <bfredl> it's minimalist in dependency requirements. just another c codes talking to our lua codes

[17:21:45] <sunjonSenghanBri> I just wondered which particular pool interested you
[17:22:18] <jaawerth[m]> oh haha sorry, well nvim is what got me interested in lua/fennel at first but then I came to realize over time that a lot of stuff already on my system already either had bindings for it or used it for scripting/config out of the box

[17:23:55] <jaawerth[m]> so I've been using it as a general toolkit for a lot of stuff, including some graphviz, hammerspoon/spacehammer on my work macbook (only thing making it a half-decent experience for me), pandoc filters.. um, random scripts like I often use fennel to write http scraping filters for newsboat and the like..

[17:26:20] <gpanders> jaawerth[m]: I have not
[17:26:38] <sunjonSenghanBri> re: architext type stuff. I'd intended to play around with pandoc-like conversions using TreeSitter
[17:26:46] <jaawerth[m]> it's pretty great. gives you an vim-which-key to work with for leaderkey bindings, among other goodies
[17:27:21] <jaawerth[m]> I had previously implemented, like, alt+mousedrag (which I really missed from linux) and stuff a couple years back but since adopting spacehammer I just use the leader keybindings + grid/tiling API

[21:56:47] <sunjonSenghanBri> "good lord"
[21:57:03] <saltrocklamp[m]> tree sitter handles syntax highlighting and indents, so you can disable the traditional vimscript equivalents and let tree sitter do it all
[21:57:11] <saltrocklamp[m]> (among other things)
[21:57:53] <saltrocklamp[m]> i've found that tree sitter isn't that reliable, the python and node parsers seem to get irrevocably glitched out during long/complicated editing sessions, requiring a full restart of nvim
[21:58:02] <saltrocklamp[m]> and the python indents and folding are totally broken
[21:58:22] <sunjonSenghanBri> `:e` should be enough to resync
[21:58:25] <saltrocklamp[m]> but it's still really cool tech and it's obviously still immature / wip
[21:58:35] <sunjonSenghanBri> and indent/folding isn't primetime
[21:58:41] <saltrocklamp[m]> sunjon (Senghan Bright): yeah, the issue is that i start needing to `:e` after ever single modification to the file
[21:58:58] <sunjonSenghanBri> unicode stuff in the file?
[21:58:58] <saltrocklamp[m]> nope
[21:59:03] <saltrocklamp[m]> i haven't been able  to figure out how to reliably get tree sitter into that state
[21:59:08] <sunjonSenghanBri> oddness. fair enough
[21:59:19] <saltrocklamp[m]> but it only seems to happen during big sessions w/ lots of open files and lots of refactoring happening
[21:59:31] <saltrocklamp[m]> sometimes it also just crashes entirely with a big lua error message
[21:59:40] <saltrocklamp[m]> definitely beta quality stuff, but i'm really excited about it still
[21:59:55] <saltrocklamp[m]> the text objects are super cool
[22:00:00] <sunjonSenghanBri> yep
[22:00:14] <aphysically> are you on nightly? saltrocklamp[m] 
[22:00:18] <sunjonSenghanBri> I'd try and find the problematic ft/parser and disable that if it got irritating
[22:00:35] <saltrocklamp[m]> i still consider targets.vim an essential part of my workflow, but i've overridden a few of those text objects w/ their tree sitter equivalents and have been generally pleased
[22:00:40] <sunjonSenghanBri> I can work with no errors from TS, until I start playing with unicode
[22:01:03] <saltrocklamp[m]> i have been experimenting w/ adding support for the "parameter" text objects to lua tables in addition to just function arguments
[22:01:08] <saltrocklamp[m]> those queries are a bit fiddly to get right
[22:01:08] <sunjonSenghanBri> anyway!
[22:01:18] <saltrocklamp[m]> aphysically: yes
[22:01:33] <saltrocklamp[m]> although i haven't had that issue in a while, maybe it was fixed recently
[22:01:43] <sunjonSenghanBri> st3fan's question reminded me of something I tried ~1 year aog
[22:01:44] <sunjonSenghanBri> *ago
[22:01:56] <sunjonSenghanBri> to list/set g:terminal* stuff automatically
[22:02:33] <sunjonSenghanBri> it works... outside of nvim :]. My problem was comms to/from the parent terminal from nvim
[22:02:48] <sunjonSenghanBri> "to" worked fine, but I couldn't get query replies

[23:33:52] <ii14[m]> some keys and key chords are not single byte. for example when you press an arrow key, the terminal sends something like ESC,[,A

[23:34:21] <ii14[m]> s/on/or/
[23:34:30] <ii14[m]> and that's the timeout between those bytes
[23:34:40] <ii14[m]> so that probably should be left alone
[23:34:40] <CodeSpelunker> here is another question: is there some way I can separate out different parts of my init.vim?
[23:35:05] <ii14[m]> you mean to different files? of course
[23:35:11] <CodeSpelunker> how can I do that
[23:35:27] <CodeSpelunker> that's what I actually meant to ask hehe
[23:35:28] <ii14[m]> for vim script you have `:source` command and in lua you can use `require`
[23:36:17] <sunjonSenghanBri> `:source` and `:runtime` both work with lua files too I believe.
[23:36:36] <ii14[m]> also check out :h vimfiles

[23:37:50] <ii14[m]> with separate lua files you can attach the language server though

[23:39:50] <ii14[m]> the most useful parts from `:h vimfiles` are `plugin`, `ftplugin` and `after`. and probably `autoload` if you want to lazy load vim functions

[23:40:22] <ii14[m]> yes
[23:40:27] <CodeSpelunker> cool
[23:41:00] <ii14[m]> the best way is probably to have it in ~/.config/nvim/lua and then in init.vim `lua require 'something'`
[23:41:37] <ii14[m]> you can use `:source`, but everyone usually uses `require`
[23:43:24] <ii14[m]> * in ~/.config/nvim/lua/something.lua and
[23:44:01] <CodeSpelunker> or wait my idea is creating like an "init.lua" and doing `require init.lua` from "init.vim"
[23:44:06] <CodeSpelunker> is that what I'd want?
[23:44:51] <ii14[m]> require is not a vim command btw, it's lua so it'd have to be `lua require 'something'`
[23:44:57] <CodeSpelunker> oh I see

[23:45:11] <CodeSpelunker> I have one idea anyway
[23:45:13] <ii14[m]> `init` is a somewhat special name
[23:45:19] <CodeSpelunker> hmm
[23:45:39] <CodeSpelunker> I might just name it lua then
[23:45:53] <ii14[m]> maybe config.lua 
[23:45:57] <sunjonSenghanBri> lua.lua?
