[00:00:48] <edk> Elon_Satoshi: i don't think it does
[00:01:54] <Elon_Satoshi> So OTR releases these MAC keys after it's finished with them so that the messages could plausibly be altered in a transcript, but when you first get the message, does it still prove that the message hasn't been tampered with in the moment?
[00:02:03] <edk> yes
[00:02:18] <edk> as with most things OTR though that's a fairly clumsy way to do it
[00:02:30] <Elon_Satoshi> fascinating
[00:03:23] <edk> it pioneered the space of OTR-like protocols (surprising, right?); signal achieves the same ends in better ways nowadays
[00:04:50] <Soni> OTR is an overlay protocol, which makes it highly suitable for all sorts of things you wouldn't be able to do otherwise
[00:05:14] <edk> most protocols are overlaid over something
[00:05:38] <edk> you could transport signal's protocol over instant messengers if you wanted too
[00:09:05] <Elon_Satoshi> So where's my Weechat plugin for Signal protocol encryption over IRC?
[00:09:54] <sarnold> you haven't written it yet
[00:10:55] <rqsd> We're still at the point where otr + mIRC isn't even a thing yet; IRC is a dying protocol, good luck trying to save it

[00:17:23] <sarnold> etc
[00:20:42] <Elon_Satoshi> Why ignore it? I think it's notable that when compared to Libera, a significant fraction of users was lost from Freenode. It seems like that really hurt IRC's userbase.
[00:21:50] <Elon_Satoshi> In fact, it looks like the users on Libera are only about half of what Freenode's users were
[00:22:38] <Elon_Satoshi> Why does geekshed's user graph look like a soundwave, or a rabbit's heartbeat?
[00:23:29] <sarnold> certainly a bunch of the freenode users were zombies who weren't actually using irc
[00:23:29] <Elon_Satoshi> Come to think of it, Freenode and Libera's users are a little wibbly wobbly
[00:23:37] * int-e idly wonders where this discussion would be on topic
[00:23:48] <sarnold> when freenode imploded they either didn't care to move or didn't even know it happened, etc

[00:24:46] <Elon_Satoshi> uh, we're potentially solving mysteries by looking into IRC data, and mysteries are cryptic?
[00:25:27] <sarnold> I think the last thing irc needs is something that makes it *harder* to use
[00:25:33] <sarnold> and crypto tools certainly hit that :)
[00:27:18] <Elon_Satoshi> oh wait I think it's oftc that's all wibbly wobbly
[00:31:14] <parazyd> IRC is dying out mostly because nobody ever bothered to write an interface for it that looks like all mainstream apps.
[00:31:58] <electr0n> eh, most users I encounter do it via terminal tui's.

[17:01:06] <iz> JAYNE: if you are an encryption specialist, why would you ever pick level 1 or level 2?  is this for a video game or RPG system or something?
[17:01:07] <yawkat> IND-EAV, IND-CPA, IND-CCA

[17:03:31] <iz> if it's strong encryption, you won't be able to decrypt the key, and an encryption specialist would only pick strong encryption
[17:03:48] <iz> oh, you have the key?
[17:04:02] <JAYNE> Its easy encryption i think its not like AES or ed25519
[17:04:16] <JAYNE> but like i said im not cryptographer at all
[17:04:22] <JAYNE> yes
