[12:54:47] <henk> Hi, I’m wondering about the word "sure" on a website.  It uses the word in constructs such as «Your data can be sure in Our_Product».  I have never seen the word used in a context where it supposedly means something like "secure" or "safe".  Is it just me or is that unusual?  Is it valid?  (I’d provide the website’s URL for more context but I’m not sure that would only be considered "context" and
[12:54:49] <henk> not "advertising", please let me know.)

[13:16:49] <henk> darsie: https://securesafe.com
[13:19:07] <henk> darsie: Yes, I thought so, too.  I am german myself and AFAIK there is no differentiation between "security" and "safety" as there is in english, it’s both just "Sicherheit".  And it’s the same for the adjectives "safe" and "secure": it’s both just "sicher" and "sure" can also translate to "sicher".
[13:21:11] <darsie> It's a Swiss site.
[13:44:21] <henk> darsie: Yes, correct.
