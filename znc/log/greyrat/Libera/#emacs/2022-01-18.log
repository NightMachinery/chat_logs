[00:12:47] <nonfxnl> Hello everyone o/ I want to disable display-line-numbers-mode when .org files are opened (but nowhere else). I've found that I need to use the org-mode-hook but I can't figure out how.

[00:14:43] <johnjaye> nonfxnl: the convention is that calling with positive number enables the mode. e.g. (my-mode 1)
[00:15:24] <johnjaye> hmm that function isn't the same though
[00:15:33] <johnjaye> its description says it enables the mode if arg is omitted or nil

[03:34:11] <spudpnds> Hey folks! I'm using org-babel, and I have a #+RESULT block with a #+NAME. Let's say that result block contains "hello". I want to to refer to that named block ("hello") in my org prose.
[03:35:02] <spudpnds> Now if it were a #+MACRO I could do {{{hello_block}}}. If I were in a code block I could use noweb and say <<hello_block>>>. But what if I am just in vanilla org markup?

[18:21:17] <artchad> rpav: Yeah, having Emacs take advantage of multiple CPU cores would be huge improvement. But as it hasn't been done yet, it's probably reasonable to assume that achieving that is not trivial.
[18:21:51] <rpav> artchad: sure .. i'd be happy with better rendering and a better edit buffer structure 
[18:22:13] <rpav> an edit tree could really improve life for nontrivial buffer sizes
[18:22:27] <artchad> better rendering? Like in which way?
[18:22:36] <rpav> also a better cursor-oriented API, but i think that could be hacked with existing tools, assuming someone hasn't already

[18:24:02] <rpav> i don't think those would help much
[18:24:30] <rpav> really you shouldn't run exwm in your "regular" emacs session anyway imo, and then there's not a lot of reason for multithreading
[18:24:33] <artchad> EmacsOS - Where Dreams Become Real
[18:24:40] <rpav> and cuda doesn't really do much for anything here
[18:24:47] <bremner> if your window manager is CPU intensive, then you have bigger problems than single threading

[18:28:58] <artchad> rpav: Could you explain the difference between "compositing" and "window management"? Or maybe link to a place that wxplains the difference?
[18:30:29] <rpav> artchad: compositing takes the contents of the window's texture/buffer/etc and composites it into the texture that's getting put on the screen; window management is determining where the rectangles go, sending them messages, handling some messages, etc
[18:31:25] <rpav> window decoration is determining what the borders around the rectangles look like, which may involve adding more rectangles, but also drawing the contents of those, and managing their input/behavior
[18:31:38] <rpav> these should be 3 entirely separate, composable things
[18:31:55] <thblt> Notice that in Wayland parlance, the "compositor" is the program that does everyhing. 
[18:32:08] <rpav> yes, which is one of many reasons wayland is crap
[18:32:32] <thblt> Ha, opinions. I have some of those.

[18:34:31] <artchad> Yeah... T ^ T
[18:34:32] <rpav> e.g. the way i'm advocating, you get remote/streamed window stuff for basically free, you can require only one fully-trusted component (the compositor being the only thing that has access to visible window data), and you can mix-and-match stuff like "how decorations look/behave" with "how window layout works" (tiled/floating/etc)

[18:37:57] <bremner> bilbo: the odds of elisp being replaced by anything and it still being called emacs are vanishingly small
[18:38:01] <thblt> bilbo: it's safe either way. Even if Emacs switches to Guile, it won't drop the giant elisp codebase.

[19:33:47] <johnjaye> ,setcdr

[19:34:22] <fsbot`> (setcdr CELL NEWCDR)

[20:13:45] <Catie> Still, &key parameters ain't nothing to sneeze at
[20:14:06] <acdw> yeah I've done something /like/ that before, neeasade, but wanting to get it really right is where it gets weird
[20:14:07] <corwin> Catie: aux args are the other special feature it's good for (if you want to know if a var was passed with nil vs not passed at all)
[20:14:28] <johnjaye> apparently that also puts an implicit cl-block around the body
[20:14:34] <artchad> corwin: the thing is that if you increase the font size in a buffer that uses company-mode, the suggestions are all out of whack. Also the modeline doesn't scale when using C-x C-=.
[20:14:45] <neeasade> acdw: I imagine so -- mostly I'm tossing my doubts into your "rich text" mention
[20:14:50] <acdw> mm right
[20:14:53] <neeasade> because rich support would entail finer locking (more faces)
