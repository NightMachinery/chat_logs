[00:10:40] <jmer> ... He had to inject himself more than once with his pen
[00:10:41] <Suchiman> JakeSays: although i think the pump uses an internal non rechargeable battery that is depleted to do the beeping if you remove the main battery

[00:12:38] <jmer> I for one welcome our semi-robotic overlords
[00:12:57] <Suchiman> JakeSays: my old pump had a fixed runtime of 2 years and then would shut down, + you got a second pump that you would switch to 2 weeks before the old one ran out. So on one prescription you got 4 years worth out of. The new pump is more expensive (TM) (for the insurance company xD) so you only get one of them but it comes with 4 years of runtime / guarantee and if you exceed that, the pump continous to work. Mine is now 5 or 6 years old
[00:13:33] <JakeSays> Suchiman: do you get to keep the old pumps?
[00:13:45] <Guest87> Out of curiosity, where does it pump? Into a cannula?
[00:14:32] <Suchiman> Guest87: yeah there's a catheter with a silicon needle attached to your tummy that you need to switch sites every 3~4 days

[00:15:21] <Guest87> Why do you need to move it?
[00:15:25] <Suchiman> JakeSays: i don't remember much lol, i thought we had to send the old pumps back after the 4 years, but i know i have 2 old ones in storage, i think they didn't want them back because the entire system was deprecated?
[00:15:31] <Suchiman> JakeSays: it is
[00:15:37] <Suchiman> Guest87: because of inflammation
[00:15:52] <JakeSays> Suchiman: but you don't have to poke yourself, do you?
[00:15:56] <Suchiman> Guest87: insulin is a growth hormone, it will cause swelling at the injection site and then the insulin won't work anymore

[00:30:29] <Suchiman> JakeSays, brianonymous: one thing i'm still struggeling today with is pressing the injector button on the injector, because i know it might hurt so synchronously with increasing the pressure on the injector button i tense up and then i'm like "nah gotta relax or it will hurt more" so i'm in a constant struggle not to tense up and press the button which suprisingly has very variable release pressure from barely touched it to having to press
[00:30:29] <Suchiman> hard
[00:30:31] <_genuser_> JakeSays dude one a day. It was more torture waiting for that time each day.
[00:30:38] <jmer> _genuser_: damn that does sound nasty... I just had to give my wife injections when we were trying to get pregnant.. I absolutely hated it... also because the nruse said "don't worry there's only a small risk of nerve damage if you hit the wrong spot"

[00:34:27] <_genuser_> Suchiman geez, that's gotta be tough.
[00:34:47] <Suchiman> JakeSays: the glucose sensor on the arm every 14 days, the catheter every 3~4 days, sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on how well the insulin works which i can see through the glucose sensor
[00:35:24] <JakeSays> Suchiman: no i mean how often do you have to press the pain button
[00:35:35] <Suchiman> JakeSays: well once every 3~4 days
[00:35:40] <JakeSays> oh
[00:35:57] <JakeSays> i thought it was multiple times a day.
[00:36:08] <JakeSays> 3-4 days much better. lol
[00:36:47] <_genuser_> catheter? Do you leave it in multiple days?

[00:37:09] <_genuser_> my aunt does the shot in the stomach twice a day. She's a nurse and totally used to it.
[00:37:19] <Suchiman> JakeSays: ah no, that was finger pricking for glucose tests, that i had to do 4-8 times a day, that wasn't soo bad (as far as pain goes) other than my fingers beeing to scarred up that i coudln't get anymore blood out of them. The 14 days sensor takes care of that now
[00:37:30] <Suchiman> _genuser_: yeah 3~4 days
[00:37:57] <_genuser_> Suchiman hmmm, so you have to worry about keepign the catheter clean and all that. Is that to avoid having to prick every day?
[00:37:58] <Guest87> I've had to do finger prick tests before and was always surprised by the variance in how much it hurt
[00:38:02] <JakeSays> _genuser_: if i had to shoot up twice a day i'd mix something fun with the insulin. lol

[00:40:56] <Suchiman> _genuser_: well in the good old days, you had U100 syringes for injecting insulin (into your arm, stomach, or leg) and glucose test strips which needed a drop of blood so you needed to prick your finger and press some out. Nowadays i have a CGM (continous glucose meter) that inserts a flexible strip (14d) under the skin to measure glucose in the tissue and a catheter (3-4d) to continously deliver insulin from the pump.
[00:41:33] <JakeSays> Suchiman: wait i thought you said it wasn't continuous delivery
[00:41:38] <JakeSays> now i'm WAY confused
[00:41:39] <Suchiman> _genuser_: the insulin is a growth hormon so it causes swelling at the injection site and clogs up the catheter so it needs to be switched frequently while the glucose sensor can stay put a little bit longer

[00:55:57] <jmer> I would model database DTOs for each single service which sould have their own DB
[00:56:09] <jmer> Too many responsibilities has been put into one codebase
[00:56:18] <Nasp> They shouildnt share database
[00:56:19] <jmer> i.e. there's no reason you have lots of boilerplate translation code
[00:56:28] <jmer> you could isolate that into a product information translation service
[00:56:54] <jmer> yes that is what I am saying each service should have it's own DB, they shouldn't share one
[00:58:34] <_genuser_> boilerplate code is what creates experts...

[03:02:03] <DevJohnC> wat?
[03:02:48] <Suchiman> smallville7123_: to clarify something, each of these objects is immediately available for garbage collection as there's no later reference to them ever again, the scope { } does not matter at all as far as garbage collection is concerned
[03:03:20] <smallville7123_> Suchiman: ok
[03:03:54] <Suchiman> smallville7123_: there's no API you could call to get recently allocated objects
[03:04:22] <Suchiman> smallville7123_: what you could do, is in the constructor of the object, wrap them into a WeakReference and put that into a static List
[03:04:39] <Suchiman> smallville7123_: the WeakReference will not keep the object alive but allows you to check if it's still alive

[03:48:21] <JakeSays> brianonymous: they do make eye trackers but they're super expensive
[03:48:30] <smallville7123_> would it be possible to get notified when an object is garbage collected via WeakReference
[03:48:36] <brianonymous> _genuser_: it is difficult to do both.. im probably at a 60% code/40% meetings level at this point
[03:49:09] <Suchiman> smallville7123_: notified, no, but if it was collected, TryGetTarget will return false
[03:49:17] <_genuser_> brianonymous is management side more meetings with other departments, etc? I find that a lot of code shops are removing the manager role where team leads reporting to a director, etc.

Pop / drop it, look at the next one, is it dead? no? then use it as the ancestor, which then builds your ancestor tree by being able to do e.Ancestor.Ancestor.Ancestor which is equivalent to e.d.c.b
[03:51:56] <smallville7123_> eg temporarily call the "parent" object

[03:52:23] <smallville7123_> alright :)
[03:52:32] <_genuser_> brianonymous I think that tends to be the case. The manager really just manages whatever needs managing and it's org specific too. I'd like to manage the devs, etc. but I don't want to be the person doing what you stated.
[03:53:25] <smallville7123_> having WeakReference means there are no strong references, right?
[03:53:48] <smallville7123_> eg 'b' cannot hand on to 'a' for as long as 'b' is alive, ?
[03:53:53] <JakeSays> smallville7123_: it means they can't lift much
[03:54:14] <Suchiman> smallville7123_: yes, that reference will not prevent the GC from collecting it, but as long as it is still alive, you can get a reference to it
[03:54:28] <smallville7123_> or rather, a's lifetime does not depend on b's lifetime

[12:59:25] <MichaelLong> canton7, you should ask that microsoft. that sentence was taken from their docs, by my mistake I copied the text of .WriteLine(string, object) though.
[12:59:55] <MichaelLong> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.console.writeline?view=net-6.0
[13:01:00] <smallville7123_> even the example uses \n instead of \r\n
[13:01:20] <MichaelLong> the thing is, I never had problems with it, not on the Windows platform, nor linux
[13:01:29] <smallville7123_> how does it know that \n is a new line on windows
[13:01:58] <smallville7123_> does Windows itself treat BOTH \r\n and \n as new lines ?
[13:02:47] <smallville7123_> or does it only treat \n as a new line and \r is just infront of it for some special reason?
[13:03:18] <MichaelLong> smallville7123_, all valid questions but not so relevant for me to remember the details. You could test it out by using Console.Write and append your new line chars to it and test it out
[13:03:34] <kobo>  \r is carriage return, which afaik is just move the cursor to the beginning of the line
[13:03:39] <kobo> and \n is new line
[13:03:40] <canton7> MichaelLong, argh sorry, I got caught out by source.dot.net showing me linux-related files by default
[13:04:01] <kobo> so I suppose the difference would be if intepreted literally, that the \n would move to new line, but not at the beginning
[13:04:15] <smallville7123_> kobo: which the console does even if \r is not given...
[13:04:39] <kobo> yep, but that's probably just how the console works then
[13:04:41] <smallville7123_> is \r\n only needed when using the Legacy console ?
[13:04:49] <canton7> kobo, yeah, and you'll see that on e.g. serial terminals still, if it's receiving just \n, and it's not configured to treat \n as an implicit \r\n
[13:05:07] <kobo> yeah. I suppose most modern interprets \n as \r\n
[13:05:22] <canton7> smallville7123_, not all terminals do that. E.g. putty, when connected to a COM port, will by default treat \n as just moving down a line, but not moving back to the first column
[13:06:07] <smallville7123_> is the interperentation of `\n` itself OS specific?
[13:06:47] <canton7> I think it's better to say it's "inconsistent". Most things treat \n as the same as \r\n now -- most utilities on Windows do for instance
[13:07:13] <canton7> Note that until relatively recently, Notepad just wouldn't show a linebreak if you just used \n, so your files with \n line endings were just rendered on a single massive line with no breaks
[13:07:14] <smallville7123_> so on windows it would be translated to \r\n -> \r\r\n
[13:07:23] <canton7> No. Things aren't that stupid
[13:07:27] <smallville7123_> depending on the device interperating the \n
[13:08:07] <smallville7123_> such that for linux it is \r\n and windows it is \r\r\n
[13:08:22] <canton7> Incorrect. Programmers aren't that dumb. \r\n still gets interpreted as \r\n, even on a system which will happily treat \n as a "new line and carriage return"
[13:09:03] <smallville7123_> how so? issuing \r twise would have no effect if the cursor is already at the start, right?
[13:09:07] <smallville7123_> twice*
[13:10:17] <smallville7123_> unless it is simply for tiny performance gains in the display terminal/modern ?
[13:12:26] <smallville7123_> anyway, should i treat '\n' as a new line unless explicitly requested to convert/output/filter an OS specific new line ?
[13:12:59] <canton7> smallville7123_, because software isn't stupid. People are capable of writing code which interprets \r\n and \n as both meaning "new line"
[13:13:32] <canton7> See here in StreamReader for example: https://source.dot.net/#System.Private.CoreLib/StreamReader.cs,790
[13:14:17] <kobo> sql question but.. If I have a FK with "Check Existing Data on Creation" to no, and also No for enforce replication and foreign key constraint. I would have an FK without any constraints at all?
[13:14:21] <canton7> See how it treats \r, \n, and \r\n all as meaning "new line", and doesn't need to go creating a mess such as '\r\r\n'
[13:14:42] <kobo> Like this: https://i.imgur.com/cHaa4Mb.png
[13:14:49] <smallville7123_> eg in windows, when writing to a file, \n should be converted to \r\n if it is not preceeded by a \r right?       this is confusing :(
[13:15:17] <smallville7123_> why does windows have to require "\r\n" as its new line instead of '\n' as linux and other OS's do
[13:15:48] <irwiss> windows doesn't have such requirement, individual software does
[13:16:04] <irwiss> even notepad.exe understands \n these days
[13:16:10] <smallville7123_> why doesnt Windows changes it's default new line to '\n'
[13:16:42] <smallville7123_> is \r\n only set for compatibility with old programs?
[13:16:43] <irwiss> because it's built on shitpiles of legacy that can't be borked
[13:16:54] <smallville7123_> qwq

[13:57:08] <canton7> Have you told the java guys that?
[13:57:14] <smallville7123_> also java is relatively easy to port to C#
[13:57:34] <canton7> Heh, but you're asking if there's something built-in
[13:58:58] <earthy> you do realize that IKVM's development has stalled, right?
[14:01:24] <earthy> smallville7123_: anyway, both java and c# have functions to read lines, and to write lines with a particualar encoding of line endings
[14:01:49] <smallville7123_> canton7: source for such should be too hard to find :)
[14:01:54] <earthy> so, using a simple loop should allow you to convert easily.

[16:31:53] <pingo> Which lib is best for working with sqlite in C# (.net core) ? I see many nuget packages available
[16:38:21] <canton7> pingo, "best" is subjective
[16:38:33] <pingo> yeah well i am looking for recommendations
[16:39:19] <canton7> If you want a full-fleshed ORM, use EF Core. If you want pure SQL, go with Dapper. If you want something model-based but lighter than EF, go with sqlite-net.
[16:39:46] <pingo> Thanks, that helps
[16:40:07] <pingo> I'll try sqlite-net first then
[16:40:12] <canton7> Both EF Core and Dapper use ADO.NET -- the classes in System.Data, e.g. SqlConnection. sqlite-net does its own thing
[16:41:49] <canton7> So sqlite-net won't play well if you've got other stuff which assumes that you're using ADO.NET (e.g. most migration libraries won't work for you, but there are one of two that will). But it's a nice little library, and I've used it on a few projects

[19:10:08] <jmer> JakeSays: I don't think so. Whenever a method is prefixed with Get most people will just assume you can assign the result of the method to a variable.
[19:10:08] <JakeSays> GetAccounts(List<Account> accounts) is more concise than FillListOfAccounts(..)
[19:10:51] <jmer> Why not just return a List<Account> ?
[19:10:54] <JakeSays> jmer: well, no, most people would base their assumptions on the method signature
[19:11:04] <jonp> sure, butâ€¦. "Get" to me would imply a return value of List<Account>, not a parameter
[19:11:10] <jonp> so "Fill" feels better to me, or "AddTo"
[19:11:27] <JakeSays> jmer: as i said, there are valid reasons for the caller to be in control of the container allocation
[19:11:27] <jmer> it doesn't HAVE to be Fill just something that indicates you aren't getting something back, you're doing something to the input.
[19:11:30] <jonp> or "Add", or "Append"â€¦

[19:12:03] <jmer> JakeSays: couldn't they be that even if you returned the List<Account> ?
[19:12:06] <JakeSays> jmer: you are paying too much attention to the semantic meaning of the container itself.
[19:12:17] <JakeSays> jmer: huh?
[19:12:18] <jmer> JakeSays: It doesn't have to be a container :P
[19:12:42] <JakeSays> GetAccounts - the 's' implies plural
[19:12:54] <JakeSays> which requires a container
[19:12:57] <jonp> "Get" implies "return value"
[19:13:04] <JakeSays> jonp: i disagree
[19:13:40] <jonp> i wonder if there's a counterexample in the BCLâ€¦
[19:14:17] <jmer> JakeSays: The caller could be responsible for the allocation even if you return the List<Account>
[19:14:24] <jmer> by taking it as an input
[19:14:38] <JakeSays> jmer: why return something that you pass in?
[19:14:46] <jonp> there's a `void GetRandomBytes(â€¦)` method
[19:15:01] <jonp> `void GetNonCryptographicallySecureRandomBytes(â€¦)`
[19:15:05] <jmer> JakeSays: if I say to you "Jake, get me the remote" I don't epxect you to place it in the fridge. I expect you to give it to me
[19:15:23] <JakeSays> jmer: that's not a valid comparison.
[19:15:28] <jmer> Why not?
[19:15:37] <jonp> 'cause it isn't?
[19:15:54] <jonp> jmer: for that comparison, the "container" would be provided, the "container" being JakeSays' hand
[19:16:01] <JakeSays> jmer: because when i write code i interact with a computer, not a human
[19:16:07] <jonp> "get the remote [and put it into provided container]"
[19:16:08] <jmer> jonp: I... I certainly don't want JakeSays' hand near me xD
[19:16:33] <jmer> ok ok.. bad example... I still think it's bad naming to call something get and not return something
[19:16:56] <jonp> normally i agree, but i'm looking at `monodis --method mscorlib.dll` output, and seeing a fair number of `void Getâ€¦` methods
[19:17:01] <jonp> GetObjectData()
[19:17:08] <jonp> *lots* of that one
[19:17:28] <jonp> GetMemoryInfo()
[19:17:40] <jonp> so yes, lots of counterexamples.
[19:17:43] <jonp> my assertion is thus invalid
[19:17:56] <JakeSays> jmer: my point is simply that you are putting more weight on the syntax of the signature of the method than of the semantics of the method. there are more things to consider than just syntax.

[22:28:25] <bomb> JakeSays Rust isn't hip anymore, try Zig
[22:28:31] <MatthiasVance> Zig-a-zig-ah!
[22:28:53] <MatthiasVance> (which is short for shit and cigars)
[22:28:58] <bomb> still snake case, but uh oh
[22:29:05] <lz_> shitgar
[22:29:36] <bomb> in the next few years you'll see " <most boring shit ever> in Zig! " with 900 upvotes on Reddit and the orange site
[22:30:07] <redoc> what is rust mainly used for?
[22:30:48] <MatthiasVance> To get rid of metals
[22:31:20] <redoc> Anyone know the shortcut to rename multiple instances of the same variable?
[22:31:32] <MatthiasVance> What do you mean multiple instances?
[22:31:39] <MatthiasVance> All the references?
[22:31:44] <redoc> yes
[22:31:49] <MatthiasVance> Press F2 in VS
[22:31:52] <MatthiasVance> Or whatever is your "rename"
[22:32:08] <MatthiasVance> redoc: The documentation is really good
[22:32:24] <redoc> not as good as this channels support for a mundane question :P
[22:32:38] <redoc> you got me twisted if you think im going to read VS documentation lol

[22:33:55] <bomb> VS has docs?
[22:34:05] <redoc> only when it gets sick
[22:34:15] <bomb> what a waste of manpower
[22:34:19] <Nasp> Didn't you ask this 4 hours earlier
[22:34:32] <redoc> Nasp: no, yesterday, you were somewhat close
[22:35:13] <redoc> Nasp:  what color undies do you have on?
[22:35:24] <Nasp> I dunno, blue i think
[22:35:32] <redoc> nice
[22:36:39] <bomb> cyan here
[22:36:55] <bomb> they were cheaper than the black ones, I ordered in bulk
[22:37:03] <redoc> cyan looks good on my floor
[22:39:24] <bomb> what do my undies do on your floor??
[22:40:37] <lz_> I need a blind girlfriend https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTCglFSvUCU
[22:40:43] <lz_> then I just need to pretend I'm a cat
[22:41:46] <JakeSays> bomb: i didn't find zig all that interesting
[22:44:27] <JakeSays> bomb: actually i think it was the casing that turned me off
[22:48:08] <redoc> bomb: you know exactly what they are doing

[22:50:09] <lz_> the video that made bomb famous when he was younger https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjGSMUep6_4
[22:51:32] <JakeSays> huh. it is an interesting lang though
[22:52:33] <JakeSays> it supports a feature missing from most languages: methods on enum types
[22:53:39] <jonp> Java & Swift do that.
[22:53:45] <jonp> i like the Swift approach
[22:57:24] <JakeSays> wow zig has a catch operator and i like it
[22:57:40] <jonp> zig looks interesting
[22:57:49] <JakeSays> const number = parseU64(str, 10) catch |err| return err; - awesome
[22:57:56] <JakeSays> c# should have that
[22:58:03] <JakeSays> jonp: it does
[22:58:29] * JakeSays can't like something suggested by bomb, dammit.

[23:16:28] <lz_> brianonymous: math stuff and that's it
[23:16:43] <lz_> oh and maybe some pointer related stuff, like handles etc. in c++
[23:16:54] <brianonymous> yeah, i could see a use in like a complex number lib or somethin

[23:22:16] <JakeSays> i really like the idea of a catch operator
[23:22:51] <redoc> JakeSays: doesn't try/catch work the same way?
[23:23:09] <JakeSays> redoc: that's a statement
[23:23:16] <JakeSays> more boilerplate
[23:23:36] <redoc> but the outcome is the same, no? forgive my ignorance.
[23:23:48] <JakeSays> yes
[23:24:02] <JakeSays> but the point of language sugar is to reduce boiler plate
[23:25:12] <JakeSays> var z = x + y catch 42;
[23:25:36] <brianonymous> that smells more asserty
[23:25:54] <JakeSays> which would expand to int z; try{z=x+y;} catch {z = 42;}
[23:26:39] <JakeSays> brianonymous: this is a contrived example where an overflow should represent 42
[23:26:45] <brianonymous> oic
[23:26:48] <JakeSays> er, 42 should represent an overflow

[23:33:58] <redoc> never ran ryzen in a server
[23:33:58] <JakeSays> Slade: you getting one?
[23:34:52] <bomb> what kind of chocolate bar is that?
[23:34:54] <redoc> Slade: what would you use it for? Max 32GB Ram seems low
[23:35:10] <redoc> oh 32 per dimm
[23:35:11] <redoc> got it
[23:35:39] <redoc> im going to start looking up ryzen's in servers, never crossed my mind to leave xeon
[23:37:34] <JakeSays> redoc: it has 32 sockets.
[23:38:00] <redoc> the price is right
[23:38:05] <redoc> and the pro with ecc

[23:38:30] <JakeSays> total 1TB ram

[23:39:22] <DoofusCanadensis> should catch 22

[23:40:57] <JakeSays> $5,300 for 1TB ddr4. not bad
[23:42:34] <Slade> JakeSays: i feel like all the HDD should be disconnected these days
[23:42:36] <JakeSays> add two 3995 cpus for $15k..
[23:42:56] <JakeSays> Slade: well, they wouldn't be much use then
