[01:58:37] <aidalgol> OK, I asked because it has a reputation as a bad engine because a *lot* of shovel used the free version, which forces the Unity logo to be shown prominently on startup.

[06:12:53] <TRS-80> N.B. the term "Supported" !
[06:13:51] <cjb> I thought the RK3399 required non-free blobs?
[06:13:55] <TRS-80> It's a wild and wooly forest once you step out of RPi land, but it's not all bad.  Quite a lot if interesting hardware.  Software support is important though, hence "Supported" being so important
[06:14:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Unsupported can lead to a lot of tinkering.
[06:14:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I had a board with Debian and some support I thought was buggy but it turned out to be the board that was faulty.
[06:15:04] <TRS-80> cjb: Almost all SBC do.  However, slowly but steadily, over years this is becoming less and less the case.  There are several on that list which can be booted completely blobless by now.  And even more if you don't need graphical output (or Wi-Fi, etc.)
[06:15:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If I can plug a USB-RS232 I'm happy.

[08:09:50] <quotemstr> TLS also has weird protocol send-receive requirements
[08:09:51] <TRS-80> Aurora_v_kosmose: Yes, but first dialog is a completing-read list of search engines (including Debian packages, Emacs Wiki, others) and second is the query, with history, and some other nice features like auto populating clipboard and highlighted text
[08:09:59] <quotemstr> Yeah and for HTTP/3 you can also just use a library, yes/
[08:10:01] <twb> quotemstr: I would 100% support "just use libcurl" to get HTTP/3 support in emacs
[08:10:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> TRS-80: You can make it fancy if you want, yes.
[08:10:21] * TRS-80 really should make a video
[08:10:35] <TRS-80> Aurora_v_kosmose: it's super cozy.  Of course, I'm partial.  :)
[08:10:38] <twb> quotemstr: I suspect that would be a hard sell given what happens right now is some shitball url-get.el thing
[08:10:46] *** Joins: zakame (~zakame@user/zakame)
[08:10:58] <quotemstr> Why do we have our own HTTP client?
[08:10:59] <twb> quotemstr: for my python cases I actually looked at doing my own FFI out to libcurl, but I ran out of budget before that happened
[08:10:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I didn't go that far because I have a persistent tabs session problem. I'm still trying to work through my backlog. After which I'll more seriously mess with Nyxt
[08:11:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> quotemstr: Why not?
[08:11:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Basically every scripting language under the sun has one.
[08:11:29] <twb> quotemstr: because in HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.0, "write your own" seemed easier than adding a library dep
[08:12:02] <twb> quotemstr: and probably that was back when like... emacs didn't even have GUI support, so "do we need dynamic linking at all" was probably an open argument >_>
[08:12:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm not super sure how you'd use an http3 library with Emacs.

[08:12:35] <twb> Aurora_v_kosmose: you FFI out to libcurl and then >magic happens<
[08:12:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> twb: It kind of implies a level of async programming that isn't really common in Emacs.
[08:12:48] <twb> For bonus points also use libcurl for SSH and for SMTP!
[08:12:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Without messing with multiple processes.
[08:12:56] <twb> Aurora_v_kosmose: right that is fair
[08:13:15] <twb> Aurora_v_kosmose: "http/3 means we have to suck it up and have SOME kind of async"
[08:13:31] <dale> Third-party library hands back a selectable, Emacs hands it like a socket with special handlers?
[08:13:40] *** Joins: chaosite (~chaosite@user/chaosite)
[08:13:46] <twb> I should also say: really this is HTTP/2 and later.  HTTP/3 just replaces UDP.
[08:13:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> dale: I suppose that'd work, yeah.
[08:14:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> twb: Touche.
[08:14:13] <dale> Actually, the construct would probably be similar to dealing with a TLS library, right?
[08:14:25] <dale> I don't know much about HTTP/[23] though.
[08:14:37] <twb> dale: can libgnutls respond to emacs at any time, or only when queried synchronously?
[08:14:50] <twb> dale: also, dbus?
[08:14:56] <twb> dale: I bet dbus isn't so different
[08:15:00] <dale> twb: Oh good lord, I hope you just get a socket handle back that you can select, then wake up GnuTLS to read/write.
[08:15:27] <dale> twb: Yeah, that could be too.
[08:15:28] <twb> I have NFI because I've always just used what was there and never looked inside it

[19:10:42] <wasamasa> rewrites are fundamentally a bad idea for anything that's bigger than a hobby project

[19:19:28] <davidkrauser> I think the only time a rewrite is good is if you want something different than the original. E.g. you built A to solve C, but along the way you figured out B would be a better way to do it. It's impossible to convert A to B, so you start B from scratch

[21:28:55] <TRS-80> cheers!
[21:29:30] <TRS-80> If you don't need to cite papers and such though, I find it too cumbersome for personal usage (but maybe this is Dunning Kreuger on my part)
[21:29:33] <zebrag> grym: yes, it is also the only solution I found (or understood).
[21:29:45] <grym> i wonder how footnotes export in ascii... 
[21:30:28] <TRS-80> zebrag: It is, except keeping them all in one list which can be automatically added to the bottome of papers during the publishing process (instead of duplicating them over and over) (is my understanding)
[21:30:44] <zebrag> grym: But I think if you export it to html, you'll have to click twice to open the link?
[21:31:25] <grym> looks like it exports to ascii fine, but footnotes become 1-indexed by default 
[21:31:28] <grym> which is ... ok, sure
[21:32:08] <TRS-80> There are a few different ways to do it.  This I believe is being discussed for org-mode itself.  Then there are some packages like org-ref (I think) from John Kitchen (Kitchin?)
[21:32:16] <davidkrauser> anddam: you can also start a command sequence (e.g. C-x), then hit C-h to see what keybindings are available next
[21:32:22] <grym> org-ref is the tac nuke option, yeah

[22:40:40] <TRS-80> anddam: IMHO learning yet another layer of abstraction (on top of Emacs, which is already pretty complex) is the wrong approach.  And these "starter kits" are typically chosen by new users "to make things simpler" (or whatever).  So what then when things go wrong?  Complexity on top of complexity, and you are still not really necessarily learning the real internals / Elisp which is sort of the whole
[22:40:42] <TRS-80> point of Emacs anyway.  /rant

[22:53:49] <anddam> TRS-80: I know the gist of the rant, and if I were an old adopter I would probably agree. But I come from vim background, last years switched to the even nicher vis due to its simple structure. I found the Spacemacs promise alluring, yet it did not deliver the expected eperience for me
[22:54:18] <grym> anddam: spacemacs is certainly not simple 
[22:54:24] <anddam> mostly due to integration of third party packages though, not of its own. E.g. I hated the VCS auto-discovery support since I was using git repos inside mercurial repos, inside git repos
[22:54:24] <grym> (nor is doom; nor is emacs)
[22:55:00] <anddam> but other than that I liked using it, in the end I do not need much, I need to have a file browser, look for file by names, do search/replaces in files with regex
[22:55:31] <anddam> and those few things are easily learned, the rest was just nice cherry on top, things like org-mode
[22:56:00] <TRS-80> anddam: I get that you have strong vim keyboard muscle memory, but which package is just the keybindings?  Evil mode?  It's all the other layers I mostly object to.
[22:56:41] <TRS-80> but hey, maybe you come to same conclusion eventually, maybe not
[22:57:07] <TRS-80> in fairness, it took me a few attempts (and /lots/ of free time) to finally get of the ground with Emacs

[23:14:10] <coda> SpiderPig: are you looking for something like :session?
[23:14:15] *** Joins: janneke (~janneke@user/janneke)
[23:15:02] <SpiderPig> I dont think so. That seems to be related to having state shared between code sections or persisting somehow.
[23:15:44] <SpiderPig> my issue is that the golang language when used with ob-go module doesnt quite work right anymore because of changes to the compiler
[23:17:13] *** Joins: jatt (~user@user/jatt)
[23:17:15] <SpiderPig> the latest versions have changed to locating a specific project file where it stores dependencies. but for running code snippets in org-babel it would be simpler to just let it fall back to the old GOPATH method

[23:18:18] <SpiderPig> It used to fall back to that mode naturally in the absense of the go project file, but it seems the newer versions require an environment variable to force that behavior.
[23:19:26] *** Joins: rq (~rq@user/rq)
[23:19:44] <SpiderPig> I figured being able to set a buffer local environment variable would be the fast solution.
[23:21:13] <SpiderPig> It would have been nice if the compiler just accepted a cmd argument.
