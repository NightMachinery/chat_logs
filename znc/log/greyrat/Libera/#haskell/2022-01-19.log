[01:58:39] <hpc> it's worth a library if you write javascript^W^Wbelieve in yourself :D
[01:58:45] <Rembane> d34df00d: How did you solve it? :)
[01:59:42] <d34df00d> Rembane: for an empty or singleton list, return the list containing of that list. Otherwise, pick a number between (1; length xs), `take` that many off the list, recur on the `drop`, append the result of the `take` to the recursive call result.
[01:59:59] <d34df00d> Not proven to give statistically meaningful results, but OK for my purposes.
[02:00:09] <monochrom> A library would need to parametrize a lot of things, e.g., the distribution of how many splittings, the distribution of each actual splitting point, etc etc...
[02:00:55] <Rembane> d34df00d: Nice solution! You can use splitAt if you want to have take and drop in the same function.
[02:01:13] <d34df00d> Yep, that's in fact what I'm doing :]
[02:01:16] <hpc> i wonder how many quick checks haven't been written because writing that partitioning code yourself is too annoying
[02:01:40] <d34df00d> splitAt is nice and handy!
[02:01:48] <Rembane> d34df00d: Sweet! :) You can also use partitionM and feed it a Bool generator, but I don't know if it's worth that extra library.
[02:01:57] <Rembane> hpc: Seven! At least!

Say I'm benchmarking something and want to use the same inputs over and over again 1 million times just to see how long it takes.

[04:07:18] <Axman6> huh, interesting, that's just compensated arithmetic - see edwardk's compensated package
[04:08:08] <Axman6> also, I think I've realised why the alignment is so weird in that fpmacros file above - it's aligned to show which FP units should be running in parallel on the CPU
[04:08:13] <Axman6> (a guess)
[04:08:17] <EvanR> my example may not work because of Common Subexpression Elimination

[06:04:07] <Cajun> its set up such that using bind will compile (since the game gets passed to the drawN) but i cant use >>= in do notation without the arrow <-, and >> means i dont have to use an arrow, so it looks cleaner. problem being i cant use the normal >>......

[06:05:39] <Cajun> and the shadowing idea isnt bad, but doesnt solve the constant binding issue. i am not affront to it though
[06:06:35] <Cajun> i could use state in the interpreter for those functions, but i tried that and my code got messy *fast*

[06:12:51] <Cajun> EvanR: thats >>= in that instance. more specifically, `f x y foo >>= g z w` is the same as `f x y foo >>= \foo' -> g z w foo'`

[06:37:17] <Axman6> Hmm, just had a possible terrible idea - when processing data which comes in as serialised binary, we usually parse it into a Haskell type with all the relevant fields, which can increase the size of the data quite a lot. Instead, we could read the data, parser it, but then use data MyType = MyType_ !ByteArray#; and provide pattern synonyms for the parsed type. Anyone know of this being done?
[06:37:53] <Axman6> (ByteArray# being somewhat arbitrary, it could be any representation of bytes with a length)
[06:38:26] <c_wraith> I'm not familiar with that exact technique, but I've certainly seen libraries that just allocate a thunk and only parse the inner elements if the thunk is demanded
[06:39:02] <c_wraith> which works very well on length-prefixed encodings.  Still works on other encodings, but it takes a little more effort.
[06:39:03] <EvanR> similar to javascript typed arrays

[06:41:25] <EvanR> how complex is your data, just some value backed by bytes, or does it represent nested levels of stuff
[06:41:35] <Axman6> IIRC this is how capt'n proto or... one of those other serialisation libraries works, which aim to keep the in memory representation the same as the on the wire one

[06:47:21] <EvanR> an ADT programming interface on top of some big buffer of bytes would be cool
[06:48:01] <Axman6> on a somewhat related note, I wish we had the binary pattern matching syntax that Erlang has
[06:48:15] <EvanR> pattern matching would look into the buffer. Construction on the other hand
[06:51:16] <c_wraith> There is a big question of whether you do a check to see that the data parses correctly up-front
[06:51:28] <c_wraith> You probably *should*
[06:51:48] <c_wraith> unless you're able to trust the data, for some reason.  (It was signed by another instance of the same program, for instance)
[06:52:13] <Axman6> yeah, the only way to create them would be to parse them
[06:52:33] <c_wraith> not in length-prefixed binary data.
[06:52:43] <c_wraith> If you could trust it, you wouldn't even need to parse it
[06:53:55] <Axman6> sure - my question is mostly about the interface for working with the data, using pattern synonyms over some bytes
[06:54:35] <c_wraith> I think it has some value.  The real trick would be how to make it into a library
[06:54:38] <Axman6> storing things in memory encoded using CBOR :thinking-face:
[06:55:09] <c_wraith> there's no way to abstract over patterns :(

[07:10:11] <c_wraith> anyway - my point was that this is not the sort of thing that easily fits into a library.  The kinds of library designs currently used for parsers tend to be very Applicative-centric, and it's hard to get the guarantees this needs out of Applicative.

[10:15:55] <int-e> there you have your additional strictness demonstrated with actual bottoms
[10:16:20] <hololeap> right, that makes sense

[14:43:08] <MiguelNegrao> Hi all. What is the best/most popular solution for a generic uncurry function that uncurries for tuples of any length ?
[14:44:03] <MiguelNegrao> I found this one https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tuple-0.3.0.2/docs/Data-Tuple-Curry.html#v:uncurryN

[14:45:52] <MiguelNegrao> I found this issue also ("curry & uncurry family of functions"): https://github.com/haskell-foundation/foundation/issues/223
[14:46:56] <MiguelNegrao> The solution here doesn't seem to be viable as type class instance is needed for the result type: https://ro-che.info/articles/2013-01-29-generic-uncurry
[14:46:59] <sshine> MiguelNegrao, I'd go with lists :D

[14:47:42] <MiguelNegrao> lists, hum... ?
[14:47:52] <MiguelNegrao> How would that work ?
[14:48:14] <sshine> (what I mean is, if you want to perform an operation on a tuple of a variable size, then lists are data structures with a variable size.)
[14:48:31] <MiguelNegrao> basicaly, I need to transform any function of type (a1 -> b, a1 -> a2 -> b, a1 -> a2 -> a3 -> b, etc) into ( a -> b)

[14:49:01] <MiguelNegrao> because I need to use that function as arrow (think `arr` combinator) and the input must go in as a tuple
[14:49:41] <MiguelNegrao> The functions I need to turn into arrows, are any function of gi-gtk, so they already exist and I can't change them.

[14:52:07] <MiguelNegrao> In this case not exactly `arr` but `arrM :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> MSF m a b` , e.g., from [here](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dunai-0.8.1/docs/Data-MonadicStreamFunction-Core.html#v:arrM)

[15:17:23] <tomsmeding> MiguelNegrao: you can also do this, but type inference breaks quite badly and you probably have to add type annotations everywhere: https://paste.tomsmeding.com/UflC766M
[15:17:50] <tomsmeding> this then works: `uncurryN (\x y z -> x + y + z :: Int) (1::Int, (2::Int, (3::Int, ()))) :: Int`

[20:21:31] <EvanR_> many things from untyped lambda calculus don't work as is when you add types
[20:22:26] <tomsmeding> merijn: probably a bad idea, but (in 2d land): store for each rect with left-top (x,y) the other rect with left-top (a,b) such that a<=x, b>=y, and b is minimal with tiebreaker (a is maximal). Also store the symmetric thing on the top. Then by following these "other rect" pointers you kind of walk a convex hull thing around your query point, if you start with a rect with left-top (x,y) with x <=
[20:22:26] <tomsmeding> queryx and y <= queryy, optimised by some metric. Not sure if this actually works

[22:21:23] <EvanR_> that's a 7 tuple
[22:21:29] <fizzsegfaultbuzz> i was thinking of creating a table mapping the preimage to the image and then uniformly perturbing the preimage of points which map to locations i like
[22:21:47] <fizzsegfaultbuzz> then i would iterate, updating that table
[22:22:21] <Henson> EvanR_: ok, well, it's not using a (Double,Double,Double,Double,Double,Double,Double)
[22:22:31] <fizzsegfaultbuzz> that would probably create a bit of a fixed error with respect to the limit distribution but that is probably ok
[22:22:36] <EvanR_> yeah strict records for that kind of data is often a big win
[22:22:52] <EvanR_> like data V2 a = V2 !a !a
[22:23:03] <EvanR_> good for Int, Double, etc

[22:23:27] <Henson> monochrom: right, no more lazy tupling

[22:32:27] <monochrom> yeah, analogous to "unbox".
[22:32:53] <monochrom> Now, it is the name "Boxing Day" that makes no sense to me, why is it not "Unboxing Day"? >:)
[22:32:54] <tomjaguarpaw> Reversing the packing that implicitly happened.  Perhaps "nonpack" and "nonbox" would be better.
[22:33:09] *** Joins: vicfred (~vicfred@user/vicfred)
[22:33:31] <tomsmeding> monochrom: because the ones that pack the boxes are always late and still have to do it frantically on the unboxing day?

[22:44:18] <monochrom> OK OK fine! "I'm Haskelling" can also mean doing just a little part of Haskell.
[22:44:50] <monochrom> I'm humaning.
[22:45:04] <[itchyjunk]> I am lifting a -> b to Maybe a -> Maybe b hence monading?

[22:45:33] <tomsmeding> [itchyjunk]: that's what fmap does, and fmap is in the Functor typeclass
[22:45:41] <tomsmeding> every Monad is a Functor, but a Functor does not make a Monad
[22:45:50] <monochrom> Actually that is not entirely pointless. Behind it is the theorem that a lot of fmap's are catamorphisms.
