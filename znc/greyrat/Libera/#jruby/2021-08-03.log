[00:03:30] <headius> weird but w/e, easy to add and then we pass all the test_handle_interrupt* tests from CRuby

[00:28:36] <headius> changes in PR to support uninterruptible Kernel#p have also added a few functional interfaces to Block: Function, BiFunction, and TriFunction, which use Block#call forms
[00:29:03] <headius> I think we had never added these because of the question of whether to use yield or call but call seems like the right choice now
[00:29:39] <headius> I have pushed all changes and all relevant tests and specs are now passing and untagged
[00:59:54] <headius> lopex: any luck on that issue?
[01:06:42] <headius> Needed one more tweak but it's going green again. Will merge shortly and then see where we stand on remaining 9.3 items
[01:07:09] <headius> This was the last or one of the last big items I had to do
[01:19:45] <lopex[m]> headius: not yet, havent got a chance to look at it
[01:20:35] <headius> enebo I have punted a few more issues and PRs to 9.3.1 and 9.4. We are down to 15 open items
[01:21:42] <headius> Two major categories are prepends and some autoload edge cases that I will review
[01:23:30] <enebo[m]> nice.  I started looking at a prepend bug last week but did not make any headway....wondering how much we should punt on any issues which have been broken for a while
[01:25:14] <headius> Yeah I don't know
[01:25:39] <headius> Issues with a real-world breakage would take priority obviously

[21:12:10] <headius> enebo: this is wacky: https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6764
[21:14:19] <enebo[m]> lol
[21:18:33] <headius> enebo: maybe you can point edipo.federle in the right direction on that bug
[21:18:34] <headius> oh you just did
[21:23:22] <enebo[m]> ahorek pretty much pointed us to the fact this is not canonicalized but I am confused about basic identity
[21:23:23] <enebo[m]> isn't 10/10 == 1/1 for a rational?
[21:24:28] <enebo[m]> haha
[21:24:29] <enebo[m]> even in MRI?
[21:24:46] <headius> yeah I am looking at that
[21:24:46] <headius> it literally does equals on numerator and denominator and they have to match
[21:24:46] <headius> so it is an issue that we are not reducing it
[21:25:33] <enebo[m]> We clearly have a bug I am just wondering if we have two
[21:25:33] <headius> https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/283b3d8f99c01a13e727b2edf0a7643a67d16361/rational.c#L1180-L1190
[21:26:37] <enebo[m]> mri26 -e 'p(Rational(1, 1) == Rational(10, 10))'
[21:26:37] <headius> $ ruby26 -e 'p Rational(10, 10)'
[21:26:37] <headius> (1/1)
[21:26:38] <enebo[m]> true
[21:26:38] <enebo[m]> haha ok so it gets canonicalized
[21:26:38] <enebo[m]> I just checked and we do pass what I typed
[21:26:38] <headius> we match that behavior
[21:26:39] <headius> but we do not canonicalize this in AST or after
[21:27:43] <enebo[m]> so the solution is we need to canonicalize the values somewhere
[21:27:43] <enebo[m]> Doing it in the AST would prevent possibly having it happen more than once but doing it however we construct the actual object arguably is no duplicated code and will future proof this happening later
[21:28:49] <enebo[m]> lunch
[21:28:49] <headius> yes
[21:45:24] <ahorek[m]> conversion isn't for free, but https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6765/files should fix the problem
[21:46:45] * ahorek[m]  < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/6076e8108fa8015c41ef2dd76cd48359ac2665e4/message.txt >
[21:48:55] <headius> fix in jit too 😀
[21:51:27] <ahorek[m]> good catch :)
[22:15:59] <enebo[m]> ahorek: you got a cast mismatch error in IRRuntimeHelpers
[22:23:41] <enebo[m]> lol ok I think I was looking at previous commit.
[23:06:33] <ahorek[m]> yeah, it should be ready now
[23:08:58] <enebo[m]> ahorek: coolio.  Just merged it.
[23:11:28] <headius> Yay
