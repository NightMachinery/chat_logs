[04:39:06] <Grinnz> the one main reason to use Net::Async::IRC or Mojo::IRC over building your own is it'll handle PING and initial connection for you
[04:39:13] <yanmaani> yeah, and I want that much high-level, but not high-level enough where you have a method for, like, athenticating 
[04:39:28] <Grinnz> authenticating is lower level than state tracking, lol
[04:40:19] <yanmaani> yeah, it looks like POEx::IRC::Backend or Protocol::IRC is what I want
[04:40:33] <Grinnz> Net::Async::IRC differentiates between connecting, and connecting with the authentication sequence
[04:40:44] <Grinnz> so that seems like it should cover whatever you want?
[04:40:53] <LeoNerd> I'm not quite sure why you think your solution is Protocol::IRC and attaching it to a stream, rather than Net::Async::IRC
[04:41:00] <LeoNerd> the latter /is/ just Protocol::IRC attached to a stream
[04:41:14] <GEttR> give Mojo::IRC a look yanmaani - it handles the painful stuff, and you can choose how much you want to listen to everything else
[04:41:17] <Grinnz> note that the login method is for *connecting*, not nickserv login
[04:41:19] <yanmaani> basically, what I want to write is a proxy for IRC. You connect to the proxy, you issue some commands to the proxy, and it sends you on your merry way. No state tracking needed.
[04:41:21] <Grinnz> you have to do nickserv yourself
[04:41:30] <LeoNerd> So in effect you're saying "I won't use {module}, I'll instead {write the same code as module}"
[04:41:43] <LeoNerd> Yup; NaIRC will do just fine for that usecase
[04:41:56] <Grinnz> yeah i don't really understand what about either Net::Async::IRC or Mojo::IRC is too high level for what you've said
[04:42:21] <yanmaani> LeoNerd: no, I don't intend to authenticate
[04:42:26] <Grinnz> ... so don't?
[04:42:31] <yanmaani> I'm sort of XY probleming myself here, aren't I
[04:42:38] <genio> yes
[04:42:41] <LeoNerd> yanmaani: OK, so don't call the ->login method. Done
[04:42:53] <LeoNerd> You do know you can use a module and not be forced into using /every/ feature of it, yes?
[04:43:12] <yanmaani> I want to write a proxy of sorts. You connect to the proxy, the proxy asks you to verify a certain thing (i.e. by privmsg'ing a certain nick), the proxy then connects to remote server and blindly forwards everything
[04:43:26] <LeoNerd> Yah; NaIRC will be fine for that
[04:43:32] <yanmaani> so I don't need all that much of IRC parsing - just check if the message is a privmsg
[04:44:04] <mst> p3rl.org/Parse::IRC
[04:44:09] <yanmaani> hmm, NAI might actually be what I want
[04:45:11] <LeoNerd> With a small amount of additional prodding, NaIRC will also work just fine for your "pretending to be an IRC server" connection as well, that your real clients connect to
[04:45:15] <LeoNerd> It'll do both sides of the proxy
[04:45:48] <yanmaani> LeoNerd: Would that require any implementation? The protocol is optional, right?
[04:45:57] <LeoNerd> ?
[04:46:24] <yanmaani> Just push some text to the client telling it what to do and to do /msg XXX YYY, then start blindly forwarding when PRIVMSG received
[04:46:46] <yanmaani> so there's no need to implement anything else; just put all the non-privmsg commands into a buffer and send them when ready
[04:46:47] <LeoNerd> Right but you still need to notice "when PRIVMSG is received"
[04:50:18] <yanmaani> Oh yeah, NAI is a client
[04:50:49] <yanmaani> I want something that's agnostic as to whether it's the client or server protocol. So that should be Net::Async::IRC::Protocol, then?
[04:51:07] <LeoNerd> Yes
[04:51:27] <LeoNerd> It's about 95% the way there towards being a Net::Async::IRC::Server, I just didn't get around to writing or releasing that
[04:51:48] <LeoNerd> also because "::Server" suggests that it implements the -entire- IRC data model inside it, which it wouldn't. It's just the stream-handling layer
[04:51:57] <LeoNerd> There isn't really a good name for that currently
[04:52:34] <yanmaani> LeoNerd: Backend, as in POEx::IRC::Backend?
[04:52:35] <Grinnz> yeah, i would imagine a Server would link with other servers and etc
[04:53:28] <yanmaani> nope, no linking here - just server-side of C2S and client-side of C2S :)
[04:54:36] <LeoNerd> ServerConnection -maybe- but it's a bit of an unwieldy word
[04:55:09] <LeoNerd> Whereas something like Net::Async::HTTP::Server is already assumed to be just the lightweight protocol connector thing, and the actual data model / content is supplied by the containing program
[05:03:39] <pflanze> I'm using $critic= Perl::Critic->new(), without arguments, but in a script which did "use lib ..." to the relevant paths, and I'm feeding a path in $critic->critique($path) which is actually relative from cwd.
[05:04:16] <pflanze> Yet somehow Perl::Critic manages to neither use the relative path, nor load the module from the "use lib" paths I set up, but from the *installed* modules of the same name.
[05:04:22] <pflanze> Huh??

[05:28:50] <Grinnz> the releaser information is significant to CPAN releases
[05:30:28] <Grinnz> also there *are* plenty of cases where the owner/original author has nothing to do with releases anymore, so you can't unambiguously show that either

[05:33:38] <Grinnz> yeah, but it's more like if the github releases page showed who did the commit that each release is based on.
[05:33:45] <pragma-> gotcha
[05:34:26] <Grinnz> complicating factors is that "distributions" don't really exist on cpan
[05:34:48] <Grinnz> there's nothing but convention requiring that the next version of Import::Into has to come in a release named Import-Into-version

[18:23:07] <gordonfish-> simcop2387: Which quite frankly is what is wrong with the web. A web-site should still be usable in older browsers. Too many web devs rely on more bleeding edge changes that really narrow what browsers it'll work in.
[18:23:53] <simcop2387> gordonfish-: not sure if they've done it for rendering reasons or security reasons, XP really isn't secure in any fashion anymore

[18:26:14] <gordonfish> simcop2387: Yes stock xp is very insecure, but anyone who knows what they are doing will be fine. I have an XP vm that I use from time to time since I have clients who still run 2003 servers and sometimes need older browser versions for vendor apps that wont work properly in newest browsers, things like that. It's a mess, sure, but it would be less so if web devs would limit how much new stuff they use on wide audience sites.

[18:29:29] <simcop2387> gordonfish: yea but anyone who knows what they're doing is almost certainly not going to use xp.  anyone still running xp like that and only xp probably aren't the ones who know what they are doing
[18:30:13] <gordonfish> simcop2387: You'd be surprised how paronoid some people are of any Windows version Vista and later.
[18:31:34] <gordonfish> (Also, one can't rely on sites that catalog user agents of browser visits to generate stats on what OS/versions people are using, as many people who do use XP a probably using UA changers.)
[18:32:43] <gordonfish> (So there are probably more people still using XP/2003/XP-64 than a lot of people realize, even if it is far from the best choice, as more and more programs fail to run, forcing one to use old versions.)

[18:34:39] <pragma-> `if ($cap =~ /=/) { ($cap, $value) = split /=/, $cap; } else { $value = 1; }`  is much better written as   `($cap, $value) = split /=/, $cap; $value //= 1;`   isn't it?

[19:00:31] <v`> how do u delete
[19:00:38] <v`> is it /nickserv drop
[19:01:08] <pragma-> v`: they deleted the nickserv database anyway
[19:01:36] <pragma-> v`: they just moved to a new ircd and chose to start fresh with new databases
[19:01:48] <pragma-> (or were too stupid to figure out how to migrate)
[19:02:34] <OnlineCop> At least they kept all the unhashed passwords. That should help returning registrants.
[19:02:38] <simcop2387> pragma-: they got pre-told by their new ircd and services developers to "fuck off" if they want support for doing anything with them, so they likely didn't even try to migrate (it is possible to do but likely needs help to do it properly)
[19:03:10] <pragma-> indeed. crazy times.
[19:03:17] <simcop2387> i believe because during the first channel culling they banned the ircd developers
[19:03:27] <shaldannon> I'm curious why they decided to drop the previous ircd
[19:03:46] <simcop2387> shaldannon: same reason original staff were planning to do it, it was old, klunky, and had development issues
[19:04:04] <pragma-> shaldannon: they want to link up with _all_ the ircds in the world and make one gigantic irc network and they think this ircd will help them do that, apaprently.

[23:03:13] <pragma-> like, for instance, suppose a cpan module wanted to use utf8 throughout all its .pm files without having to declare it in every single one
[23:03:18] <Grinnz> just keep in mind, writing a module built for a specific preamble that isn't explicitly stated means that code will break out of context - this might be fine for say, in-house project modules, but not for anything you want to share
[23:03:26] <Grinnz> yeah, no, cpan modules cannot do that
[23:03:39] <Grinnz> they can use Import::Into or Import::Base explicitly though

[23:04:11] <LeoNerd> Even with ChiaCoin, disk space isn't so expensive you can't put `use utf8;` at the top of every file

[23:27:18] *** pap is now known as pep
[23:27:24] *** pep is now known as par
[23:28:17] <tm604> the implementation is quite short so it'd be easy to do a variation such as "only apply to modules matching /^Some::Prefix::/"
[23:29:06] <par> I have, $str =~ s/>/&lt/g; $str =~ s/</&gt/g; how can I does this in a single regex?
[23:29:48] <LeoNerd> best not to
[23:29:50] <Yaakov> par: why?
[23:29:54] <LeoNerd> It's far simpler as two
[23:30:06] <Yaakov> par: Writing things that can be easily read is always best.
[23:30:10] <Grinnz> par: my %replacements = ('>' => '&gt;', '<' => 'lt;'); $str =~ s/([<>])/$replacements{$1}/ge;
[23:30:15] <Grinnz> with your obvious errors fixed
[23:30:27] <choroba> Grinnz++
[23:30:33] <par> Grinnz just prove LeoNerd 
[23:30:38] <par> Thank you
[23:30:46] <thrig> if only there were HTML::Entities or something
[23:30:52] <Grinnz> par: but you probably want to escape the other HTML special characters too, so use HTML::Entities
[23:30:56] <Yaakov> thrig: It would be nice.
[23:30:58] <Grinnz> or Mojo::Util::xml_escape
[23:31:11] <par> I'll look into that
[23:31:31] <Grinnz> (there aren't a lot, but the ready made solutions work fine anyway)
[23:31:36] <par> should be easier not to escape all of that myself
[23:31:52] <Yaakov> par: As a rule, never write in one line what is easier to read as more than one. The maintenance programmer will thank you instead of cursing you.
[23:32:13] <Yaakov> par: Also, YOU are very likely to be the maintenance programmer.
[23:33:16] <par> Yaakov: will try not to make the next one called me at 3am
[23:33:42] <Yaakov> par: There's that, too.
[23:34:10] <Grinnz> LeoNerd: the reason in this case i actually would suggest doing it in a single regex is because, inevitably, he will discover he wanted to escape & too

[23:35:40] <Yaakov> rindolf: That's a good practice. Makes things more regular.
