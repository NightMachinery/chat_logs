[01:51:37] <ysiry> what am I doing wrong?
[01:52:49] <DarthGandalf> > what am I doing wrong? -- attempting to use freenode
[01:52:54] <bookworm> ^
[01:53:11] <DarthGandalf> it's dead :(
[01:53:18] <ysiry> i just want to set it up properly
[01:53:25] <gothkat> Not dead enough
[01:53:28] <bookworm> thoroughly 
[01:54:34] <ysiry> it's still alive and requires sasl to access
[01:54:41] <gothkat> It's still in DNS. when it goes NXDOMAIN then its dead
[01:55:00] <Casper> When it goes NXDOMAIN you'll want irc.joseon.kr :p
[01:55:03] <DarthGandalf> and you're sure you need to access it?
[01:55:11] <ysiry> yes
[01:55:46] <DarthGandalf> do you know some project which stayed there?
[01:55:53] <ysiry> dude, that's not the point
[01:56:03] <DarthGandalf> then what is?
[01:56:15] <ysiry> how to properly config sasl on znc
[01:56:22] <DarthGandalf> sasl on znc just works
[01:56:36] <ysiry> then i obviously misconfigured it somehow
[01:56:38] <DarthGandalf> freenode broke something during their latest update
[01:56:38] <MetaNova> username and password
[01:56:39] <Casper> ysiry, if your nick is also ysiry on freenode, you're not registered.
[01:56:45] <gothkat> Freenode('s owner) screwed over the community, so the community is not particularly friendly at this point. Probably best to contact Freenode.
[01:56:52] <MetaNova> I didn't try PLAIN, but: <*status> Connecting to ipv6.chat.freenode.net... <*sasl> EXTERNAL mechanism succeeded. * *** You are connected to ipv6.chat.freenode.net using TLS [..]
[01:57:03] <ysiry> Casper, maybe that's why?
[01:57:17] <Casper> ysiry, then go to irc.com to register your nick, then try again.
[01:57:25] <Casper> Because to use SASL you require an account.
[01:57:31] <Casper> If you don't have it, SASL will not work.
[01:57:38] <ysiry> i had an account there since 2000~ish
[01:57:42] <ysiry> weird
[01:57:43] <Casper> Yeah, that account is gone.
[01:57:47] <DarthGandalf> they dropped the database
[01:57:57] <DarthGandalf> all chanserv/nickserv all gone
[01:57:58] <Shaxine> @ysiry i had to register on irc.com in order to acess ffreenode onlt to find all the channels pretty much empty
[01:58:09] <Casper> The oldest account is roughly over 2 months old now.
[01:58:30] <ysiry> i just wanna visit the cemetery 
[01:58:32] <gothkat> I'm pretty sure it was a "You can't cancel your account, we'll cancel all the accounts" tantrum. 
[01:58:51] <ysiry> see if there are ny graves of my relatives
[01:58:52] <Casper> Allow me to show you the rektness of freenode at the moment; https://i.cspr.cc/338afd0a49.png
[01:59:18] <ysiry> graves and landfills still hold valuable information
[01:59:29] <DarthGandalf> there are no graves there either
[01:59:30] <Casper> This grave/landfill only holds trolls mostly.
[01:59:43] <DarthGandalf> graves were also removed
[01:59:50] <ysiry> i cant believe they purged all the accounts
[01:59:59] <DarthGandalf> then go register there and see for yourself
[02:00:05] <Casper> DarthGandalf, new graves were created the moment you flipped on the SASL-only switch. :p
[02:00:09] <gothkat> ysiry it shows exactly how things are going. sums up the whole situation
[02:00:30] <DarthGandalf> Casper: that depends on what you mean by graves
[02:00:43] <gothkat> And don't knock landfills, some of them are valuable. https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-55658942 has 7500 bitcoins, Freenode probably doesn't even have that many users left
[02:00:51] <DarthGandalf> if you go there, and join some channel which used to be alive, the channel doesn't have users anymore, no topic etc
[02:01:11] <DarthGandalf> I don't consider that a grave
[02:01:12] <Casper> DarthGandalf, currently the graves of people who are too lazy/unable to configure SASL :P
[02:01:28] <DarthGandalf> I disagree: these people are not in those channels
[02:01:37] <DarthGandalf> Exactly for that reason
[02:01:38] <MetaNova> death (of the user base)
[02:01:51] <ysiry> did any opensource project abandon irc altogether after freenode's meltdown and transferred to proprietary chats like discord etc?
[02:01:58] <DarthGandalf> ysiry: yeah
[02:02:08] <gothkat> The list of unused registered nicks was the grave. They bulldozed it.
[02:02:11] <ysiry> is this the death of irc?
[02:02:16] <DarthGandalf> https://github.com/siraben/freenode-exodus has the list
[02:02:26] <DarthGandalf> don't confuse irc with freenode
[02:02:29] <DarthGandalf> despite them wanting you to
[02:02:35] <DarthGandalf> freenode is dead, long live libera
[02:02:40] <MetaNova> ^
[02:02:47] <gothkat> ysiry just irc.com and freenode is dead. The rest of irc has been dying for 20 years and will continue to do so for the next 20.
[02:02:54] <ysiry> i've been using irc since before freenode, i dont confuse the two
[02:03:01] <ysiry> but still, this was the biggest network
[02:03:07] <DarthGandalf> it was
[02:03:09] <gothkat> IRC will remain https://xkcd.com/1782/
[02:03:11] <MetaNova> /was/
[02:03:12] <DarthGandalf> now libera is the biggers
[02:03:15] <DarthGandalf> st
[02:03:22] <gothkat> ysiry it was. they decided they don't want to be. Now you are here.
[02:03:36] <ysiry> but many projects abandoned apparently ?
[02:03:54] <DarthGandalf> I pointed you to the list
[02:04:00] <gothkat> ysiry most came here.
[02:04:02] <bookworm> all of them
[02:04:03] <Casper> This is currently the top 8 IRC Networks, the past 90 days https://i.cspr.cc/17827cdedc.png :P
[02:04:03] <gothkat> Most are here right now.
[02:04:19] <bookworm> all the rest are not worth it either
[02:04:39] <DarthGandalf> bookworm: not all
[02:04:50] <ysiry> ircnet still remains
[02:04:54] <DarthGandalf> oftc got a chunk of projects
[02:05:02] <ysiry> it's been around for like 30~ years
[02:05:08] <bookworm> well, move /away/ from there
[02:05:17] <bookworm> doesn't matter where they moved, but they moved
[02:05:33] <ysiry> i've been using irc since 94
[02:05:33] <bookworm> all that stayed there have some serious op issues
[02:06:24] <ysiry> dalnet used to be massive
[02:06:38] <ysiry> now it's pretty slim
[02:06:48] <gothkat> I'm still chatting on dalnet at this very moment. less than 20 seconds idle time
[02:07:33] <ysiry> i remember dalnet got started by #startrek folks on efnet if im not mistaken
[02:08:17] <ysiry> and they came up with nickserv/chanserv/memoserv "services" if im not mistaken
[02:08:56] <DarthGandalf> Casper: do I understand correctly that fn wiped the db twice?
[02:09:06] <DarthGandalf> The second time when enabling SASL-only
[02:09:20] <Casper> DarthGandalf, I don't think so, because my nick was still registered when they enabled SASL-only. 
[02:09:21] <DarthGandalf> I know of when they switched to inspircd
[02:09:26] <DarthGandalf> Ah ok
[02:09:38] <Casper> And still grouped with another nick as well, but I couldn't use it anymore because you can't do /nick anymore.
[02:09:50] <DarthGandalf> I never tried to connect to it since that
[02:10:31] <Casper> I already had SASL enabled anyways, so I remained connected as is.

[10:45:21] <fred> looks like you installed it via your pakacke-manager of your distro
[10:46:23] <fred> you seem to need to first to create a conf
[10:48:23] <iljas> yes, via my pocket-manager
[10:48:57] <iljas> i have created a znc.conf in /var/lib/znc/configs/znc.conf
[10:54:27] <fred> is the znc-user allowed to enter/alter that folder?

[11:30:52] <iljas>  Process: 5027 ExecStart=/usr/bin/znc -f --datadir=/var/lib/znc (code=exited, status=217/USER)
[11:31:16] <Ellenor> iljas: it's failing before execstart i think
[11:31:40] <Ellenor> change User=znc to User=_znc
[11:31:40] <fred> iljas: find /etc/systemd -name *znc*
[11:31:55] <iljas> it worked with _znc user
[11:32:04] <fred> so kep it like that
[11:32:33] <iljas> chance User=znc in /etc/init.d/znc?
[11:32:39] <iljas> change*
[11:32:52] <fred> in case you to _znc
[11:33:37] <iljas> i've deleted the user _znc
[11:33:56] <iljas> and i'm trying to make the daemon run with the user znc
[11:33:59] <sheep> after editing the .servic file you may need to run systemctl daemon-reload
[11:34:13] <iljas> i use init.d
[11:35:04] <sheep> are you using systemd with init.d? I don't think that's very reliable
[11:35:23] <Ellenor> freaking hell
[11:35:59] <sheep> it sounds like it's getting the wrong user
[11:36:06] <iljas> https://wiki.znc.in/Running_ZNC_as_a_system_daemon
[11:36:06] <Ellenor> iljas: which distribution of gnu+linux?
[11:36:15] <iljas> ubuntu 18.4
[11:36:22] <Ellenor> 18.04*
[11:36:32] <Ellenor> also
[11:36:33] <iljas> 18.04
[11:36:33] <fred> (nvm)
[11:36:43] <fred> should work as latest
[11:36:43] <Ellenor> wow 3 years outta date
[11:37:41] <Ellenor> but irrelevant. relevant is the fact that you should write the unit file to /etc/systemd/znc.service (if I'm not mistaken)
[11:37:56] <Ellenor> not /etc/init.d/znc.service
[11:38:29] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[11:39:14] <iljas> #   Insert the script into the boot sequence: sudo update-rc.d znc defaults    # For Debian systems
[11:39:26] <sheep> that advice is outdated
[11:40:13] <iljas> ok, trying the Create the file /etc/systemd/system/znc.service (system service) or ~/.config/systemd/user/znc.service (user service).
[11:40:18] <sheep> debain bssed systems (except niche distros like devuan) have been using systemd for several years now
[11:41:31] <Ellenor> with svscan clones (which can be run under systemd), you write _servicedir_/znc/run containing #!/bin/sh and znc -f --datadir=bla, then you symlink _servicedir_/znc to _scandir_/znc, and send svscan a SIGALRM
[11:41:40] <Ellenor> but ignore me
[11:41:59] <Ellenor> my advice is not useful unless you already use s6.
[11:42:28] <iljas> i do not see how the systemd uses the scrypt /etc/init.d/znc
[11:43:23] <sheep> it doesn't
[11:44:05] <sheep> that article was written before ubuntu and debian switched to systemd
[11:44:25] <Ellenor> iljas: write the contents suggested on the wiki page for systemd distributions to /etc/systemd/system/znc.service, run systemctl enable znc, then watch the journal for znc coming alive
[11:44:46] <iljas> ok
[11:45:26] <Ellenor> sheep: in my experience debian uses a hybrid sysv/sd system
[11:46:38] <Ellenor> on my Debian, I personally have hacked it, and run the devuan hacked openRC instead.
[11:46:41] <sheep> it had some support for running sysvinit scripts as systemd services but it's not recommended for new services and most existing sysvinit services have switched to systemd units
[11:47:09] <Ellenor> yee
[11:49:55] <iljas> in what part of znc.service should i insert the text from init.d script? Unit, service or Install?
[11:50:04] <fred> (btw - i dont like systemd either)
[11:50:30] <Ellenor> iljas: none
[11:50:33] <sheep> do not use any of the init.d script with systemd
[11:50:52] <iljas> ok
[11:51:57] <Ellenor> fred: i personally endorse orc and s6. both require their own lsb-incompatible runscript format, but s6's (and daemontools-family) runscripts are absurdly simple
[11:58:02] <fred> to be honest - for 'std deb' i also use systemd, since its the default. only my home router runs on devuan. but stuff like 'systemd-resolved' makes me sick
[11:58:58] <iljas> thats all good, but sistemd give me no text messages. it seems it is not working
[11:59:01] <fred> i'm altering resolve.conf for dnscrypt and there some still resolving enabled by systemd
[11:59:29] <iljas> lets go one step back and make init.d work with the user znc
[11:59:32] <fred> *resolv.conf
[11:59:48] <Ellenor> iljas: no
[11:59:59] <fred> just compile znc for a user
[12:00:02] <Ellenor> iljas: ps aux|grep znc
[12:00:08] <iljas> nothing
[12:00:14] <iljas> no znc process
[12:00:17] <iljas> moment
[12:00:20] <Ellenor> ok
[12:00:23] <fred> ./configure --prefix=$HOME
[12:00:27] <iljas> no no
[12:00:29] <Ellenor> systemctl start znc.service
[12:00:31] <iljas> there is 
[12:00:35] <Ellenor> o
[12:00:39] <iljas> there is a process
[12:01:05] <iljas> 5352  0.0  0.0   6528   876 pts/0    S+   10:30   0:00 grep --color=auto znc
[12:01:19] <fred> öpö
[12:01:21] <fred> lol
[12:01:25] <fred> its your grep
[12:01:30] <fred> nothing more
[12:01:33] <Ellenor> ye
[12:01:47] <Ellenor> systemctl start znc.service
[12:02:20] <Ellenor> (analogous for djb or s6: svscanctl -a _scandirectory_
[12:02:23] <Ellenor> )
[12:02:27] <iljas> znc       5367 20.0  0.4  51500 12524 ?        Ssl  10:32   0:01 /usr/bin/znc -f --datadir=/var/lib/znc
[12:02:58] <Ellenor> success!
[12:03:27] <fred> netstat -tulpen | grep znc
[12:04:26] <fred> is the znc listening to the configured ports?
[12:05:07] <fred> *is the znc listening to the configured ip/ports?
[12:06:36] <iljas> tcp6       0      0 :::1111                :::*                    LISTEN      999        4585701    5367/znc 
[12:08:10] <iljas> may be it is listenning only tcp6?
[12:08:26] <Ellenor> uh
[12:08:36] <Ellenor> usually it's 6 and 4 if it's ::
[12:10:21] <iljas> ok, i have a webmenu!
[12:10:55] <iljas> it seems the systemd works!
[12:11:18] <iljas> may be one should delete the obsolete init.d script in wiki?
[12:11:48] <fred> why?
[12:12:00] <fred> other unix still rely on it
[12:12:16] <iljas> because you do not advise use it
[12:12:18] <fred> maybe someone could clarify that
[12:12:34] <fred> ppl without systemd would need it
[12:13:05] <iljas> or write specifically in wiki to use systemd if you ubuntu is 18.04 or higher
[12:13:30] <iljas> it is much simpler to configure systemd, than init.d for ubuntu 18.04
[12:13:45] <iljas> no additional scrypt file is needed
[12:15:08] <iljas> trying "sudo update-rc.d znc disable"
[12:16:03] <iljas> removing /etc/init.d/znc
[12:16:10] <fred> rm -rf /etc/init.d/znc
[12:16:20] <iljas> yes
[12:17:23] <iljas> service still working. I'm glad
