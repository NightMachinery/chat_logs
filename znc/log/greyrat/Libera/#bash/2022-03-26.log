[01:08:27] <tirnanog> average: I had to step away for a bit there. don't encode the output of unzip. as suggested, encode the output of a shell variable iterating over a glob - or find itself - both of which are guaranteed to produce the bytes of the extracted name verbatim. it's quite possible that unzip is lying to you. I took the hexadecimal sequence there and used it to recreate the basename precisely and find -name
[01:08:29] <tirnanog> '*.srt' matches fine here.
[01:09:48] <tirnanog> I'd take parsing unzip to be be no more conclusive than parsing ls. which is to say, not in any shape or form.

[01:13:46] <tirnanog> put simply, the output of unzip doesn't ultimately constitute the input that find is tasked with processing. iterate over the actual pathnames that exist after extraction.
[01:14:35] <Earnestly> unzip has many flags
[01:14:56] <Soliton> (that perl command does shell injection, btw.)
[01:14:58] <tirnanog> for a start, unzip -l prints "\n"-delimited. that's an immediate disqualifier for any kind of meaningful debugging.
[01:15:12] <tirnanog> but even if that were not the case, it would still be a sideshow.
[01:15:31] <Soliton> pretty sure unzip does or did shell injection as well incidentally.
[01:15:34] <average> Soliton: I don't think that amount of bytes could have contained any payload..
[01:15:34] <Earnestly> tirnanog: Depends on what it does when printing filenames containing newlines
[01:15:51] <tirnanog> Earnestly: true. ultimately though, it's a sideshow.
[01:15:58] <tirnanog> pathnames or bust.
[01:16:00] <Earnestly> Soliton: You might be thinking of that story of someone giving a user sudo access to zip which has -TT
[01:16:24] <tirnanog> I mean, actual existing pathnames following extraction. not what one sees, not what unzip prints. actual pathnames.
[01:16:42] <Soliton> no, not a story. i experienced it myself. might be fixed by now though.
[01:16:49] <Earnestly> Hm
[01:17:40] <Earnestly> Soliton: -d doing tilde expansion (perhaps more?) or the glob matching it does with -W?

[01:25:39] <Earnestly> Yeah zip -T and -TT are dangerzone

[01:25:53] <Earnestly> Although tht is a bug with -T
[01:26:19] <Earnestly> Yeah that's just crap, -TT is obvious problem but has rationale
[01:26:34] <Earnestly> And in fact, -T has nothing to do with -TT, I misremembered
[01:26:48] <Earnestly> (Well it does)
[01:27:22] <Earnestly> What an odd set of flags to have, zip would be improved with them removed
[01:28:36] <Soliton> i mean -T is fine. just weird that it doesn't do the check itself and calls unzip instead and of course worse that it involves a shell for no reason.
[01:29:25] <Earnestly> But that's my point, a user could just use unzip themselves (or whatever else) instead of having zip do this.  Perhaps it exists for systems that don't have convenient shells
[01:30:11] <Soliton> i wouldn't expect that i have to use unzip at all. why can't zip check a zip archive itself?

[04:46:33] <kurahaupo> texasmynsted: what exactly do you mean by "take … to …"?
[04:46:59] <kurahaupo> take from where?
[04:47:40] <texasmynsted> I am reading a variable from a file and it needs a new name
[04:48:36] <kurahaupo> texasmynsted: What's the format of the file? In terms of a grammar, not just examples.
[04:49:11] <kurahaupo> Is the file actually a shell script or shell library?
[04:49:24] <texasmynsted> it is a .env file so like VARABLENAME=VALUE
[04:50:05] <texasmynsted> echo $(grep '^LOCAL_DB_PASSWORD' < config/.env.dev)
[04:50:09] <kurahaupo> are spaces allowed? Quotes? Multiple assignments per line? wildcards?
[04:50:28] <texasmynsted> That gets a variable named LOCAL_DB_PASSWORD. I need to set that as PGPASSWORD
[04:51:17] <texasmynsted> single assignment per line. File can be commented with #. Quotes are allowed
[04:51:57] <kurahaupo> Can the file be trusted?
[04:52:06] <texasmynsted> yes
[04:52:09] <kurahaupo> in the sense that an attacker can't edit it
[04:52:09] <djph> kurahaupo: can any files ever be trusted?
[04:52:38] <texasmynsted> it is for a local "example" database running in docker. It has only sample data
[04:52:52] <kurahaupo> eval PGPASSWORD=$( sed -n 's/^LOCAL_DB_PASSWORD=//p'
[04:53:16] <kurahaupo> err, add ""

[05:04:26] <texasmynsted> yes
[05:04:56] <texasmynsted> the file is read verbatim
[05:05:07] <texasmynsted> I mean the value is read verbatim
[05:05:31] <kurahaupo> ok, that simplifies thing. Omit "eval" from my previous suggestion
[05:06:08] <texasmynsted> okay I will try that
[05:06:35] <tirnanog> kurahaupo: yeah. it's just that I wouldn't tend to qualify it in the same way that I wouldn't it in a shell script either. there's always the option of defining a sensible PATH value up-front, if it's a concern. I understand your point, though.

[05:14:33] <kurahaupo> texasmynsted: I'm asking you to clarify whether you consider the 11 bytes PGPASSWORD= to be part of the "value" that you're talking about

[13:37:48] <pj> I mean that the chances of RANDOM % 100 returning a number between 0 and 67 are just slightly higher than the chances of it returning a number between 68 and 99.
[13:38:04] <pj> so it will very slightly skew your results, probably not enough for you to notice, or care about.

[13:58:30] <pj> It would have been nice if whoever thought to implement $RANDOM thought to also do a $RAND_MAX var at the same time.
[13:59:34] <pj> since they didn't it means that we are now unfortunately stuck with a max of 32767 and it can never really be changed or it will break scripts left right and center.

[23:40:15] <Earnestly> case is surprisingly good when you start thinking in terms of positive matches against unwanted inputs and discarding them as no-ops
[23:43:13] <wiscii> case is generally my personal choice, if there is a choice to be made

[23:45:22] <wiscii> is that valid in POSIX ?
[23:45:47] <twkm> yes.
[23:46:06] <wiscii> thanks
[23:46:34] <wiscii> i must have done it wrong before but i never figured out what i did werong
[23:46:54] <wiscii> probably something like:

[23:47:03] <shbot> wiscii: no output
[23:47:31] <twkm> x is in q's environment, but q print's a's value.
[23:47:49] <twkm> so yes, wrong vname has that sort of effect.
[23:47:55] <wiscii> yes, i probably assigned something wrong the last time i tried

[23:51:05] <wiscii> larryv: i tried something before using that syntax in a #!/bin/sh script and it did not work .. or did not work as expected and i did not get around to trying again until now
[23:51:21] <larryv> didn't work as in it printed nothing?
[23:51:58] <wiscii> honestly, i cannot remember what went wrong but the impression i had at the time is that ^that^ syntax is not allowed in POSIX
[23:52:34] <wiscii> so i tried again today and then recalled .. i've tried this before and it "didn't work" ..
