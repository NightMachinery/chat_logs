[00:01:11] <stenno> mechanist: i don't think there is a way to solve that perfectly unless you give each menuElement of listbox1 a fixed width
[00:01:20] <stenno> you mean the vertical movement?
[00:01:43] <stenno> hmm lemme think
[00:01:44] <mechanist> horizontal
[00:01:48] <stenno> right
[00:01:57] <stenno> Download moves to the right
[00:01:59] <mechanist> Download moves when the submenu appears
[00:03:16] <mechanist> exactly
[00:03:30] <stenno> position: absolute; on listbox2
[00:04:28] <mechanist> how can I do that if I used this declaration $(".listbox2").toggle(); ?
[00:04:32] <stenno> but i'd think i rather give the menu items a width that is larger than the submenu
[00:04:35] <mechanist> toggle is a problem
[00:05:33] <mechanist> not properly: The idea is to port that menu on mobile devices (hence being it responsive) so I can't use so much space

[02:15:50] <foo> I'm doing some research on a mobile-friendly calendar, something like this: https://demo.mobiscroll.com/javascript/eventcalendar/mobile-month-view -> would love to feed it events via JSON or such and they just appear. Still doing some research, thought I'd share in case anyone is a fan of something
[02:16:34] <hassoon_> json ?
[02:16:41] <hassoon_> what does that have to do with events
[02:16:58] <foo> hassoon_: oh, being able to pass a JSON array of event date/times which would get inserted into calendar... if it even exists.
[02:17:45] <foo> So far I haven't found anything that even comes close to mobiscroll demo
[02:21:20] *** Joins: \f (4c1975b719@user/f/x-7101985)
[02:23:01] <hassoon_> foo: bootstrap calendar
[02:23:39] <hassoon_> still not sure what you mean by events anyway, conserning a calendar UI
[02:23:42] <foo> hassoon_: lol, was just looking at https://bootstrap-calendar.eivissapp.com
[02:24:05] <foo> hassoon_: ohh, I mean, err, excuse my vagueness. I want to show a calendar, tap a day, see events for that day
[02:25:06] <foo> hassoon_: have you used bootstrap calendar? how's mobile support? Doesn't seem great from initial tests
[02:26:39] <foo> hassoon_: yeah, see how this loads the events via date: https://kylestetz.github.io/CLNDR/
[02:29:51] <xse> i'd have a look into caldav clients there's bound to be some similarities
[02:31:29] <xse> since you deal with json already
[02:34:36] <foo> xse: I don't have json already but thought it'd make sense here, I can do anything with the inbound feed
[02:34:44] <foo> xse: are caldav clients web-based?
[02:38:27] <xse> foo: caldav is like some webdav based protocol for calendar stuff you can use to link like for example a google calendar with X with an iphone calendar and so on, there's many many clients both web and desktop/phone.
[02:38:34] <xse> Not much to do with css in itself but checking those kind of caldav web clients can give you ideas
[02:38:49] <foo> xse: thank you
[02:39:04] <foo> xse: we do need something browser-based. I really really really like the mobiscroll one, I might just pay for that.
[02:39:58] <foo> xse / hassoon_ : eg. really really like this https://imgur.com/a/vZm7dbH
[02:40:05] <foo> That's pretty much exactly what I'm after
[02:42:49] <xse> yeah you can have a look at stuff like https://github.com/agendav/agendav for example
[02:44:10] <foo> xse: huh, been searching calendars for the past hour. Haven't seen this. I don't need the PHP part, but thanks for sharing. I think I see what you're saying
[02:45:02] <nbjoerg> foo: what are your constraints?
[02:47:42] <foo> nbjoerg: ideally, something frontend only, shows a calendar, tap on day, show events. We'll add filters later. https://imgur.com/a/vZm7dbH is literally exactly what I want - looking into https://demo.mobiscroll.com/javascript/eventcalendar/mobile-month-view pricing ... ideally I can feed the calendar events easily without too much dev work
[02:49:10] <nbjoerg> flatpickr might be a good starting point
[02:49:47] <nbjoerg> don't think you will find a complete pre-packed version unless you are willing to pay some money
[02:51:22] <foo> nbjoerg: thank you, that's what I
[02:51:27] <foo> nbjoerg: thanks, that's what I'm finding to
[02:51:28] <foo> too
[02:52:18] <xse> iirc flutter has some nice calendar ui too but at that point you get further and further away from easy/simple css things, even tho it can generate web versions and same there you can try one out and take inspiration, but there's work involved a bit
[02:52:45] <foo> I provided a simple list view but "they wanted a calendar view"
[02:53:00] <foo> I wonder if I can generate a web link for them to subscribe to with caldav... but meh, I really don't think that's feasible
[02:53:23] <xse> eeh the web demo is kinda complicated i take it backhttps://pub.dev/packages/syncfusion_flutter_calendar#get-the-demo-application
[02:55:33] <hassoon_> foo: ah events that you fill for specific dates of your choices ?
[02:55:39] <foo> hassoon_: yes
[02:55:55] <hassoon_> that's more advanced than the usual calendar app
[02:56:02] <foo> These 3 are the closest alternatives I've found: https://www.cssscript.com/demo/event-calendar-color/ https://codepen.io/davidkpiano/full/xwyVXO and https://codepen.io/chrisdpratt/pen/OOybam
[02:56:12] <foo> ... but they all require a bit of work. eg. generate calendar
[02:56:40] * foo checks pricing on https://demo.mobiscroll.com/javascript/eventcalendar/mobile-month-view
[02:57:00] <hassoon_> you might find that in e.g an admin dashboard app, in which you can dig and try to seperate the events-featured calendar sub-app and extract it
[02:57:08] <xse> also keep in mind that pretty much every iphone/android has an included calendar app and there's surely a way to subscribe to a google calendar from that ez pz
[02:57:11] <hassoon_> saw that before
[02:57:48] <nbjoerg> providing ical via url is generally how to do that
[02:58:01] <hassoon_> foo: try to inspect the dom of the calendars you like and see if you can figure out the very app/module/script/functionality powering that calendar
[02:58:01] <foo> xse: I might do that.. I can generate a dal file on my side
[02:58:46] <hassoon_> foo: you can as well use a decent calendar app, and implement the events feature by yourself
[02:59:04] <hassoon_> the calendar is ready for you , you still need to imlpement the events logic only
[03:00:02] <foo> hassoon_: do you have an example? Are you referring to a native ios/android calendar app?
[03:00:03] <xse> actually, 3rd busted solution would be to use a google sheet you know, there's easy ways to publish them as web pages
[03:01:20] <hassoon_> foo: native ios/android ? meh not sure, i'm only talking about web
[03:01:26] <hassoon_> otherwise responsive web
[03:01:36] <hassoon_> but ios/android? meh no
[03:02:19] <hassoon_> ya i agree with xse , google sheets is already a whole plateform for you
[03:02:34] <hassoon_> since you want a ios/android solution
[03:03:11] <xse> it's a funny free easy solution yeah, getting free web space, they even have full free javascript server support and so on it's crazy those days
[03:03:36] <hassoon_> google is your friend :D
[03:03:44] <xse> scary :p
[03:04:21] <foo> :)

[04:19:57] <rickame> but doesn't that just hack around the reason why the bullet hangs off the left?
[04:21:03] <hmw[at]> kind of, but then not really
[04:21:34] <hmw[at]> You'd have to dig into the HTML/CSS specs to find the proper reason, I can't give you a good explanation. Boxmodelwhateverstuffs
[04:22:03] <hmw[at]> I think margin collapse is part of the equation, too
[04:23:07] <hmw[at]> What's hacky about it is, that you can't exactly position your bullets this way, there might be a tiny offset. The only way to get it to 100.0% precision would be to hide the normal bullets and make your own
[04:23:46] <hmw[at]> You shouldn't worry about it though, it is a rather academic question.

[11:19:23] <Jaami> i am a student, when i add contents in a grid header then height of all other rows increased too. why is that ?
[11:21:37] <Jaami> please let me know if i am not asking in a right channel
[11:22:26] <Jaami> also i want to ask more questions so i want to join a suitable channel
[11:25:13] <Jaami> is there anybody home?
[11:38:10] <hmw[at]> no, wer'e all out partying
[11:39:11] <stenno> is there anybody out there...
[11:39:26] <hmw[at]> Jaami: This channel can be slow at times. Be patient, usually someone will answer eventually. I am not sure what you mean with the question. What's a grid header??
[11:39:27] * theskillwithin cracks open a beer
[11:39:27] <stenno> hello, is there anybody out there
[11:39:46] <stenno> just nod if you can hear me
[11:40:00] <theskillwithin> you can't see if i nod tho
[11:40:12] <pavonia> I'm the truth. I'm out there.
[11:40:13] * hmw[at] nods for all attending
[11:41:04] <hmw[at]> all rows growing... hmm
[11:42:49] <hmw[at]> Jaami: Btw, this is the right channel for CSS questions, so you're fine. Ideally you provide us with a live link to a page so we can use the inspector tools, or even better, you make a reduced/minimal example showing the issue. jsfiddle doesn't require account creation, you can make an example there.
[11:44:20] <hmw[at]> I think this should only happen with syntax errors in the markup or css
[11:45:56] <stenno> i am certain you can set max width for grid columns
[11:46:31] <theskillwithin> hmw[at] im confused why you bring up syntax errors when no code was pasted
[11:46:35] <hmw[at]> "the height grows" though
[11:47:00] <hmw[at]> I don't know a way to mess up grid with such a symptom in another way
[11:47:21] <hmw[at]> My hunch is, that the elements arend made into grid elements due to that possible error
[11:48:03] <hmw[at]> *potential
[11:50:07] <hmw[at]> FUrethermore, that line was meant as a question to you sort of
[11:50:54] <stenno> oh height, not width lol
[11:54:31] <theskillwithin> i don't get the question.  what is a grid header
[11:55:02] <hmw[at]> I assume it is a normal grid area, as a single top row
[11:55:48] <stenno> i wonder if we even talk about css grid here and some bootstrap silliness or so
[11:55:57] <hmw[at]> well lol ok
[11:56:07] <stenno> gotta wait for a response
[11:56:20] <hmw[at]> I tend to forget about frameworks. There is only CSS.
[11:56:57] * stenno looks more into docker in combination with vmware fusions tool 'vctl'

[11:57:39] <stenno> hmw[at]: do you know SiW ?
[11:57:39] <hmw[at]> It is not bad at all, unlike the claims I heard
[11:57:47] <hmw[at]> no, SiW?
[11:57:50] <theskillwithin> hmw[at] ya that was what I was figuring as well, but was hoping response from person asking the question lol
[11:58:05] <stenno> hmw[at]: never mind then, 'sinnlos im weltraum'
[11:58:11] <stenno> don't look it up if you don't know it
[11:58:23] <hmw[at]> lol I have never heard of it. Sounds legit though :)
[11:58:34] <stenno> some shit that was big in germany like 20 years ago or so

[11:59:21] <hmw[at]> Okay, I already get it :)
[11:59:44] <hmw[at]> oioioi it's really bad
[11:59:49] <hmw[at]> :)
[12:00:08] <stenno> the people making it distanced themself from it already lol
[12:00:15] <hmw[at]> That style reminds me one something I must have seen long ago
[12:00:16] <theskillwithin> is it true in Germany they use tanker trucks to pump beer?
[12:00:48] <stenno> hmw[at]: there is also 'lord of the weed' which was inspired by siw
[12:00:53] <hmw[at]> I wouldn't be all too surprised if that were the case. Oktoberfest seems to be quite insane and stuffs
[12:01:03] <hmw[at]> aah LoW, yes. That was it, I think
[12:02:34] <hmw[at]> "Schwarzer Kaffee, Junge" heheh
[12:03:03] <stenno> junge echt jetz wa

[12:13:08] <Jaami> plz let me just get rid of the problem real quick. i'll read all the links you gave me
[12:13:46] <hmw[at]> Yeah, they're meant for later reading I suppose
[12:14:13] <Jaami> stenno, mariana trench can be host for mount everest. better keep the bird in hand
[12:15:36] <theskillwithin> stenno idk if that article is accurate, i sent by mistake
[12:15:42] <Jaami> hmw[at], i came here to ask a question but look like i am under supervision of a hollywood film director making a movie right now
[12:16:53] <theskillwithin> Jaami see how I turned your code into a codepen.io ?  thats best way to get help
[12:16:59] <Jaami> guys, help me now, please see the code and guide me
[12:17:18] <hmw[at]> patience, my padawan
[12:17:29] <hmw[at]> I never knew about grid-row and need to read up on it
[12:17:44] <stenno> theskillwithin: seems accurate though
[12:18:21] <Jaami> hmw[at], please dont read anything more, keep thinking about you have red already :)
[12:19:06] <Jaami> theskillwithin, i am going to check those links. :)
[12:19:11] <hmw[at]> If I don't read the manual for grid-row, my only suggestion would be to use grid-area.
[12:19:22] <hmw[at]> also, I should know it anyways
[12:20:24] <Jaami> hmw[at], grid-area, start or end properties have nothing to do with height (i guess so).
[12:21:13] <stenno> holy grail with grid, hmm
[12:21:14] <Jaami> even span does not relate to height. (i guess a lot)
[12:23:22] <hmw[at]> Jaami: What do I need to change in order to see the unwanted growth?
[12:25:12] <Jaami> obviously height, but again (i guess) if height of one row is changed , other rows should not increase their height. for example in my code the 1st row height increased when contents were added but that effected other rows from 2 to 6 too. and that is confusing me.
[12:26:12] <hmw[at]> oh now I see it. Something didn't work before apparently
[12:26:30] <hmw[at]> I don't see any error so far. Hmm.
[12:26:49] <hmw[at]> And yes, I would also think, that should not be connected
[12:27:22] <Jaami> yes, but somehow they are connected and that where my head hit this channel
[12:27:39] <Jaami> :)

[12:29:15] <hmw[at]> When I disable the grid-template-rows repeat, they are no longer connected in height
[12:31:02] <hmw[at]> Jaami: That row repeat seems not to make sense with this layout. I would simply assign 3 heights for your rows instead of the repeat. I do not understand, why the height is transferred with the repeat though.

[12:34:09] <Jaami> checking
[12:35:35] <hmw[at]> Jaami: Replace my grid-template-row with    min-content auto min-content;    I suppose.

[12:38:46] <hmw[at]> Jaami: For a rather simple layout like this, I would think using grid-row/column like in your example is more difficult to read compared to grid-template-areas. Check out https://harald.ist.org/paste/grid_basic.html
[12:44:38] <Jaami> again i guess that is pretty much i need to know or if follow link then there is much more to explore. Please keep my passenger seat availble on next trip to space travel. no sure when
[12:45:20] <hmw[at]> Alright. Have fun and rest well!
