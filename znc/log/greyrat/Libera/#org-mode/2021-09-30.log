[11:00:03] <gour> konubinix: heh, that's interesting! i also plan to start with org-roam after exploring many other options and decided that org-mode is also the best general markup for writing. i have in mind more general bookmark manager like in case "web pages to read later"
[11:02:46] <gour> btw, i have some basic vim skills - not much muscle memory, so wonder whether to use doom/evil or (mostly for writing plus some web stuff - html/css/php) is better to stay with my vanilla Emacs keybindings, mostly considering using org-mode/org-roam?
[11:03:37] <konubinix> In that case, I simply keep my read-later list in a simple org-mode entry with a tag ril

[11:23:38] <konubinix> No, in the ril part, I have a qutebrowser script that writes the org heading directly in an inbox.org file
[11:24:07] <konubinix> In android, I use "share to" orgzly to save an inbox.org file as well
[11:24:16] <konubinix> Then, I have some scripts to gather both and merge them
[11:24:39] <konubinix> Then, it comes into my gtd daily routine, in the "empty your inbox" phase
[11:24:43] <gour> ok, i'm not interested for android/orgzly etc.
[11:25:00] <gour> what about doom/evil for org/roam?
[11:25:07] <konubinix> Then, I decide whether I want to refile it to the ril part or just drop it
[11:25:53] <gour> i see. thanks
[11:26:07] <konubinix> I've been using emacs since 2010, started with vanilla emacs and never felt the need to try otherwise

[12:23:41] <Demosthenex> also doom/spacemacs try to be all batteries included emacs distros, i'd suggest trying vanilla emacs and learning.
[12:24:29] <Demosthenex> emacs and org are both tools which take time to learn and master, there's no instant solution. jumping to the end deprives you of the foundation to make using it easy

[12:26:36] <Demosthenex> finally, support for users in doom/spacemacs has to goto them first because of how much they customize things. 
[12:27:14] <gour> Demosthenex: i've used org for task-management for quite some time, not so much for general writing...but now would like to add org-roam to the arsenal
[12:29:57] <Demosthenex> why?
[12:30:45] <Demosthenex> given org has hyperlinks and you can have as many files of hierachical (or not) notes, i don't understand the push to have to use an extra package to basically start to do one file per note
[12:30:53] <Demosthenex> this zettlekasten craze seems silly to m
[12:30:55] <Demosthenex> me
[12:31:01] <gour> Demosthenex: for note-taking and PKM (Zettelkasten) to help me writing articles based on my studies
[12:31:26] <gour> Demosthenex: what about backlinking?
[12:31:28] <Demosthenex> i take notes in org all the time. i have a personal knowledgebase and lots of content, hyperlinking and agenda do it all
[12:32:11] <Demosthenex> now, maybe you have a specific case where the ZK method really makes sense, i can't criticize that as i think it's a useful metaphor
[12:32:38] <Demosthenex> but i've seen many new users ask questions about org-roam and optimizing their ZK who have never even tried to just use org first
[12:33:15] <Demosthenex> more files != more organized. i think it's odd to split up notes into lots of tiny files if you can't handle one file
[12:33:50] <Demosthenex> and between agenda time based navigation and linking to other headlines or files when needed, what else do you need?
[12:34:39] <gour> since i plan to use dokuwiki for web stuff, i was considering to use that, but emacs/org-mode can be used for writing dokuwiki content as well, so...
[12:35:34] <Demosthenex> all i can say there is why a web based service when a text file will do :P
[12:35:49] <gour> Demosthenex: recently i finished studying https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/how-to-take-smart-notes/ book and it makes sense for my case 
[12:36:37] <gour> Demosthenex: heh - then i was still not sure whether to use emacs or vim-based workflow...

[12:38:09] *** Joins: unluckyshrubbery (~unluckysh@45-19-33-188.lightspeed.livnmi.sbcglobal.net)
[12:38:27] <Demosthenex> i see the ZK method as a general implementation on paper of hyperlinked notes.
[12:38:58] <Demosthenex> well, make an org file, just one, and write away. and if you want to link to something, use an org link. backlinks? M-x occur
[12:39:18] <Demosthenex> when you've got a 500k line file and if it ever starts to feel slow, then look at splitting it out
[12:40:13] <Demosthenex> this is the third time i've read roam's doc, and i can't find anything compelling about it. use capture templates to enforce consistency if you need to, use links to hyperlink your notes no problem.
[12:40:45] <Demosthenex> the only two features i see are an external cache of links to quickly create a backlink view, and an export to DOT (graphviz) to give you a visual mapping of nodes
[12:40:57] <gour> Demosthenex: thanks for the input, i'll consider it seriously
[12:41:12] <Demosthenex> i'm not trying to derail you, or be overly critical of org-roam.
[12:41:13] <gour> Demosthenex: what about references? just org-ref?
[12:41:26] <Demosthenex> org just added all new citation support, i'd consider that
[12:41:48] <Demosthenex> really though, when i read org-roam it seems to me that it's a poweruser who has documented their workflow
[12:41:57] <Demosthenex> which is great
[12:42:22] <Demosthenex> but i would challenge you to learn the tools that org provides first to accomplish your note taking goals
[12:42:59] <Demosthenex> even if you want to do a ZK method in your org file.
[12:43:24] <Demosthenex> there's no harm in having major headings for topic groups, and each subheading be a discreet note
[12:43:38] <Demosthenex> and then you use hyperlinks to adhoc jump across the hierarchy
[12:44:42] <Demosthenex> learn how to navigate your files by time with agenda, write notes and figure out what you think needs to be consistent so you can template it. use org-capture.
[12:44:51] <bkhl> I got nearly convinced about ZK at one point and started making a package that would add ZK-like IDs to each bullet point
[12:45:15] <Demosthenex> bkhl: there's a few packages that cause org to make a uuid for every heading
[12:45:27] <bkhl> Yeah, I didn't find one I like.
[12:45:37] <bkhl> But anyway I convinced myself in the process that I don't really need it
[12:45:43] <Demosthenex> for instance, org-caldav does that to my agenda files :P
[12:46:16] <bkhl> For just linking between notes, adding IDs as-needed for linking works just as well, and doesn't clutter things up with IDs that you may never use.
[12:46:22] <Demosthenex> i think that's my point though. ZK sounds cool because it was a paper implementation, but if you have a method for taking notes in a hierarchy with the ability to hyperlink, is it so special?
[12:47:06] <Demosthenex> it really just should encourage you to take notes in bite sized chunks so you can hyperlink between chunks
[12:48:37] *** Quits: dschrempf (~dominik@070-207.dynamic.dsl.fonira.net) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[12:48:41] <Demosthenex> there are several ways to format a link to an org file which don't even need a unique ID
[12:49:18] <Demosthenex> what's easier to read [[#ASDASDASDASDASD]] or [[file:dognotes.org:* border collie]] ?
[12:49:38] <Demosthenex> https://orgmode.org/manual/External-Links.html
[12:49:53] <Demosthenex> there's several ways to refer to headings in org files for linking
[12:50:06] <Demosthenex> which can be human legible
[12:53:37] * gour had problems with org-caldav & multiple calendars
[12:53:52] <Demosthenex> yeah, i have mixed results with caldav.
[12:54:18] <Demosthenex> not the least of which is my phone being stupid. i have a strong firewall which breaks the internet detection, and davx5 never syncs as a result
[12:55:01] <gour> i also use davx, but keep evolution to handle/sync calendars/contacts
[12:55:20] <gour> Demosthenex: btw, what do you use for email?
[12:55:42] <Demosthenex> i have my own nextcloud instance which supports calendar/contacts, but again if davx5 never downloads because sync doesn't run if it thinks i'm offline, then it's not very useful
[12:55:46] <Demosthenex> gour: mutt.
[12:55:58] <Demosthenex> though i've been giving serious consideration to mu4e
[12:56:45] <gour> Demosthenex: ahh, cool...i was also considering gnus/mu4e - have working config for both, but decided to switch to (neo)mutt - i still like using gmane for mailing lists :-)
[12:57:13] <bkhl> I have a Nextcloud as well but recently stopped keeping my Org notes in there and use Syncthing for those instead.
[12:57:28] <Demosthenex> using a local search engine for my mail makes sense, i have decades of mail archived locally. i think neomutt has an option to use a search instead of a maildir inbox, but since 99% of my life is in emacs already, mu4e is tempting
[12:57:45] <Demosthenex> since they added support for "roles" which was one of the critical features in mutt, i may look again
[12:58:18] <Demosthenex> bkhl: i don't have a high opinion of syncthing. always looked like another abuse of a webserver to do silly things rsync could do
[12:59:21] <bkhl> Will see, haven't used it for that long.
[12:59:50] <Demosthenex> were i to want my org files across devices, i'd just use DVCS (fossil, mercurial, or yuck, git)
[13:00:02] <bkhl> I mainly use it now to sync with Orgzly
[13:00:18] <gour> haven't seen about 'roles' feature?
[13:00:19] <bkhl> Orgzly has Git support in an experimental branch, will probably switch to that when it becomes stable.
[13:00:27] * gour is fossil user as well
[13:01:04] <Demosthenex> Orgzly is a phone viewer for org files?
[13:01:23] <bkhl> Viewer/editor

[13:01:45] <bkhl> With a focus on "planner" features, so mostly use it for being able to view/edit TODOs on my phone.
[13:01:49] <Demosthenex> like, you have a personal email account and a work one, and you send different from addresses and signatures depending on the mailbox
[13:02:04] <Demosthenex> bkhl: my phone has no keyboard, thus, it sucks.
[13:02:20] <bkhl> Gah, terrible habit built up by using MS teams, there. (My attempt to fix my typo)
[13:02:59] <gour> Demosthenex: ahh, i already configured mu4e for several account i need
[13:03:40] <Demosthenex> gour: i also have many vendors i work for, and they provide me with a mail forwarder to my inbox so i don't have to have more accounts. i use a regexp to match the domains of their customers, and set my from address/signature to match their vendor details
[13:04:00] <Demosthenex> so role may not just be for a mailbox, but determined by email contents
[13:06:03] <Demosthenex> i also use mairix currently with mutt to do deep searches
[13:06:22] <Demosthenex> which is why moving toward a search oriented inbox ala mu/mu4e isn't hard to imagine
[13:07:46] <Demosthenex> i also just replaced fetchmail and procmail with fdm, it was nearly painless
[13:08:16] <gour> Demosthenex: i was using mairix, but it does not support, afaik, utf-8 which is almost useless for me...so, will use mu or notmuch for search
[13:08:35] <Demosthenex> i wasn't aware of that, but i haven't had a problem with it either
[13:08:51] <Demosthenex> dutch doesn't have too many special characters ;]
[13:10:03] <gour> Demosthenex: you're not using evil-mode, right?
[13:10:23] <Demosthenex> gour: nope. i use emacs keybinds, everywhere.
[13:10:55] <Demosthenex> i don't like modal editing where a toggle can make my data become editing commands. i like hotkeys because they are "out of band" and are not data
[13:11:41] <Demosthenex> just remember, in the cult of emacs the use of vi isn't seen as a sin, it's more of a punishment.
[13:12:06] <gour> lol
[13:12:13] <Demosthenex> s/punishment/penance/
[13:12:56] <Demosthenex> even when i must use windoze, i have xkeymacs to remap all the binds to emacs keys
[13:13:37] * gour was last time  using windoze at the time of winxp
[13:13:54] <Demosthenex> except in firefox on any OS. i'm hugely disappointed that the only browser i feel is mostly almost trustworthy right now has completely eliminated the ability to change hotkeys AT ALL. so i'm forced to use CUA keys like a toddler

[18:44:56] <org-mode-md-expo> It seems that under 9.4.4 exporting an org file containing image links with (re)size option does not currently work.  The documentation also does not mention this feature.  The org and html based sizing attributes are ignored in md export.  Is there a md specific attr that should be used?  The resizing via #+attr_html and attr_org attributes do
[18:44:57] <org-mode-md-expo> seem to work in html backend and for inline org images.  Is there a sub group currently focused on md backend where these observations would best be directed?

[20:55:59] <Demosthenex> i credit lots of my success to org
[20:56:09] <Demosthenex> which is why i hang out here to try and return the favor
[20:56:13] <aindilis> thanks!
[20:56:32] <Demosthenex> oh, and though i'm 40 now, i was only recently diagnosed with ADHD
[20:56:41] <Demosthenex> so... for years i used org with ADHD untreated.
[20:57:13] <Demosthenex> i'm the type of nerd who takes compulsive notes at length to ensure i forget nothing, and my customers are very impressed at how my notes is like a steel trap. nothing escapes.
[20:57:21] <Demosthenex> may i ask, what OS are you using?
[20:57:26] <aindilis> :) Debian 10
[21:00:37] <Neopolitan> there is a new stable to upgrade to, if you need stable for some reason.
[21:00:38] <aindilis> (yeah, I realized that Org-mode was the thing.  I had originally disliked some aspects of it, and so avoided using it.  I tried to write my own similar system for Emacs, but it was a nonstarter)
[21:00:39] <aindilis> Originally, I disliked Emacs, and so didn't use it.  But then I realized it could be very powerful, and so I read the manual in 3 days and nights swithout any sleep.  Happiest memory.  So learning Org-mode is like that now, again.  I read half the 200-pg manual so far.
[21:00:45] <aindilis> Nice, 9.5?
[21:00:57] <Demosthenex> ok. so fighting adhd, i have for years been merciless at removing distractions on my working computer.
[21:00:58] <aindilis> My package installation on Emacs is fubar

[21:45:33] <Demosthenex> konubinix: sure, i'm aware of plenty of people who only learn emacs to use Org. my wife's one, many sysadmins i've worked with have transitioned too
[21:46:11] <aindilis_> I'm trying to convince some collaborators to use Org-mode even though they aren't Emacs users... any pointers there would be nice too.
[21:46:11] <konubinix> I also feel better not adding unecessary layers, so I think I understand your way of thinking
[21:46:56] <konubinix> A friend of mine started emacs for the support of lsp and the awesome go-pls
[21:47:28] <aindilis_> heh, couldn't configure lsp myself, still have no idea how to use it
[21:47:36] <konubinix> Now, he saw my life in org mode and he will definitely use it

[21:47:54] <aindilis_> ty! adding to notes :)
[21:48:28] <konubinix> When I do this, they are somd as well. But when they actually start emacs, they generally don't go far
[21:48:33] <konubinix> *sold
[21:48:34] <aindilis_> is org-brain or roam more featureful?
[21:48:41] <Demosthenex> konubinix: i'm not sold on the LSP thing. i get the idea of abstracting langauge specific editing information to another program. i object to it being a huge REST api built on web layers for my local editor. and if anything LSP written by linux can be used by VS-Code then we gave microsoft free labor.
[21:49:13] <aindilis_> heh. oh, I'm trying to write a vscode-mode for Emacs to help get people to switch to Emacs...
[21:49:24] <Demosthenex> aindilis_: i was discussing org-roam earlier... to me it's like a poweruser documented how he imitates a zettlekasten for notes in org, relying on many external tools.
[21:49:35] <Demosthenex> i'd suggest you try to learn to take notes with native features
[21:49:47] <konubinix> I'm totally sold to the idea of lsp
[21:49:52] <Demosthenex> after you're learned, you can compare your workflow to his and try to optimize further.
[21:50:01] <konubinix> And the support is great in python and go
[21:50:01] <aindilis_> Demosthenex: ty for the pointer

[21:50:37] <Demosthenex> in my mind, ZK is remarkable because it was a paper implementation of hyperlinked notes.
[21:50:50] <aindilis_> well I kind of wrote my own ZK a while back
[21:51:00] <Demosthenex> but now with digital information, and specifically org mode, i can take digital notes and hotlink them any way i want in org.
[21:51:19] <aindilis_> well I'm interested in the following use case:
[21:51:23] <Demosthenex> so... given modern techniques i think ZK is a cute and inventive antique.
[21:51:25] <aindilis_> formalizing natural language into formal logic
[21:51:40] <aindilis_> well note quite a formal logic
[21:51:44] <aindilis_> specifically, OpenCYC
[21:51:45] <konubinix> Yeah, ZK appears to have kind of an aura. But I doubt people generally really understand it
[21:51:59] <konubinix> And anything with backlink is called ZK now...
[21:52:05] <Demosthenex> my only point there is i dont' need addons to do ZK style note taking in org. and if you immediately jump to using one note per file and a ton of external tools, you'll have shortchanged yourself learning what's there.
[21:52:23] <aindilis_> well, so here is my question then
[21:52:35] <Demosthenex> konubinix: in a single file, you can make a hierarchy of notes. be careful to divide topics up into neat chunks by heading.
[21:52:38] <aindilis_> it's kinda related to Software Code In Database (SCID)
[21:52:39] <Demosthenex> and then, link :P
[21:52:44] <Demosthenex> backlink? use M-x occur
[21:53:15] <aindilis_> hrm, I cannot formulate my question, sorry
[21:53:16] <Demosthenex> org-roam's like the professional f1 racer, when you haven't finished driving school yet

[21:55:56] <Demosthenex> it can make a graphviz diagram of your notes, well, ok, do i need that?

[22:15:10] <Demosthenex> aindilis_: i think there may even be a public log here
[22:15:12] <Demosthenex> which is fine
[22:15:14] <Demosthenex> so save away
[22:15:22] <Demosthenex> i log all my IRC, so i can grep later
[22:15:43] <Demosthenex> Neopolitan: ok, so it is projectile. you'll have to see what it means by new project
[22:16:16] <Demosthenex> aindilis_: the key here is clients are empowered to log their conversations, instead of the server keeping it forever (ie: discord)
[22:16:29] <aindilis_> oh right
[22:16:38] <aindilis_> yeah some channels used to have a no log policy iircc
[22:16:49] <aindilis_> so I guess I was being silly though since I do log via erc
[22:16:58] <Demosthenex> actually, i think this channel has no public log
[22:17:34] <Demosthenex> yes, some channels publicly say "do not log"
[22:17:38] <Demosthenex> we haven't had to care
[22:18:02] <Demosthenex> otoh if you log because you want a copy, and you're not selling it to facebook to datamine, who cares? ;]
[22:18:15] <aindilis_> :)
