[00:04:34] <meff[m]> scuttlebutt
[00:05:46] <companion_cube> the thing that depends on how json is serialzied
[00:05:52] <companion_cube> in its hashing algorithm
[00:06:02] <imode> the haskell one?
[00:06:11] <imode> or am I thinking of something different.
[00:08:33] <meff[m]> nah, this is done in Node
[00:08:52] <meff[m]> the hashing and signing is based on the ordering of json keys, which is a no-no because there's no canonical json representation
[00:09:00] <meff[m]> so it essentially is based off Node's ordering
[00:09:17] <meff[m]> There's some other troubles with scuttlebutt too but that was a big reason of why I left the ecosystem
[00:09:42] <iDrougge> meff[m]: Not just that, but the indentation as well?
[00:10:08] <meff[m]> Hmmm now that may be the case, I just don't remember.
[00:10:27] <meff[m]> I know SSB (Secure ScuttleButt) is in the long process of trying to get everyone to move over to CBOR which does have a canonical representation
[00:12:24] <meff[m]> the whole Merkle Tree state of the world also felt a bit overkill to me, but that depends on your goals
[00:13:58] <dutchie> does SSB have a solution for "people want to use the same account on their laptop AND phone" yet
[00:14:27] <companion_cube> can't  you "just" copy the keys?

[01:20:23] <kline> palemoon is in this kind of constant cascade of becoming the very thing they hated
[01:20:35] <kline> theyve just turned off support for legacy firefox extensions...
[01:20:47] <kline> which was what they forked from upstream for anyway
[01:20:57] <kline> why? the exact same reasons as mozilla cited
[01:21:26] <technomancy> you either die a hero ...
[01:22:08] <kline> the main difference is that moonchild doesnt have a pr dept so just burns 10% of his remaining userbase every time by being too close to his name about it all

[02:10:18] <msmith12[m]> Nevertheless, the pale moon people were in the process of implementing it
[02:10:20] <rb> each element can now have a "shadow root" which can have hidden DOM nodes in it

[02:10:49] <rb> meh, it's a step towards encapulation
[02:11:10] <msmith12[m]> Well Google put it in place, and like it or not, they control the direction of the web right now
[02:11:22] <rb> not
[02:11:35] <msmith12[m]> So if pale moon wants to stay releveant, they need to support the major sites, many of which use webcomponents
[02:11:38] <vv> hey
[02:11:40] <msmith12[m]> If youtube doesnt work, whatever
[02:11:48] <technomancy> so now if you want to make a web site it requires a graduate degree in 4-dimensional hypergeometry or something?
[02:11:55] <msmith12[m]> But there are bank sites, government sites, etc.. that use the technology

[21:52:32] <companion_cube> what's the point ?
[21:53:24] <JordiGH> Man, I wish I could show everyone how beautiful cleaning up history is with Mercurial.
[21:53:29] <JordiGH> So, like...
[21:53:37] <JordiGH> Let me see if I can translate to gitese.
[21:54:03] <JordiGH> It would be like you do git checkout some_old_commit, usually at the base of your stack of commits that you want to submit for review.
[21:54:17] <JordiGH> And you want your commits to be beautiful and small and reviewable and atomic.
[21:54:55] <JordiGH> So you are now at the old state and you start editing stuff. Perhaps you rewrite the commit message. Perhaps you run, uh, `git split` to split up the commit into several ones. Perhaps you edit some files and you do, uh, `git comit --amend`.
[21:55:00] <JordiGH> So your commit is rewritten.
[21:55:23] <JordiGH> Then you do `git next` and you're taken to the next commit in your stack, the one based on your pre-rewritten commit.
[21:55:51] <JordiGH> And git automatically rebases the old version of that commit to your current version and checks out the rebased version and you can keep working on it.
[21:56:31] <drobilla> JordiGH: I do more or less exactly this with (ma)git almost daily
[21:56:34] <JordiGH> It's like a fully interactive git rebase -i except nothing is conceptually being "rebased" from the user's point of view (your stack of commits isn't changing its base).
[21:57:02] <JordiGH> drobilla: How does magit handle split? You need metadata of which commit replaces which one for `git next` to work.
[21:58:09] <drobilla> JordiGH: At any step in a rebase you can do more or less whatever you want.  So if a commit in the stack is too big and I want to split it up, I'll stage the bits I want and make a commit out of them.  You can stash your unstaged things to test it as you go before committing

[21:58:25] <JordiGH> drobilla: Oh, so you do just use plain ol' stupid git rebase -i
[21:58:25] <drobilla> JordiGH: To be fair though, I don't think any other tools make this as easy and elegant as magit
[21:58:33] <JordiGH> That's not what I mean.
[21:58:38] <JordiGH> But it's hard to make people understand what I mean.

[21:58:52] <JordiGH> Like teaching the blind what colours look like.
[21:59:11] <companion_cube> JordiGH: rebasing on top of the same commit is a thing yeah
[21:59:15] <drobilla> JordiGH: Fair enough, but I don't see anything in here that I can't achieve easily
[21:59:31] <JordiGH> That's not a rebase. It's just called a rebase because that's the only command that git offers to rewrite.
[21:59:45] <JordiGH> The base didn't change.
[21:59:49] <companion_cube> I mean in git
[21:59:59] <drobilla> If you don't want to change the base, you rebase on the same one?
[22:00:00] <companion_cube> it's like `git checkout`, the name is misleadingly restrictive
[22:00:11] <companion_cube> rebase is just manipulating a stack of commits
[22:00:17] <drobilla> I mean, sure, the names do all kind of suck
[22:01:24] <drobilla> In the context of git, though, adding a command that is identical in every way (except perhaps already checking that the base commit is already in the 'stack') seems... pointless?
[22:02:24] <JordiGH> Yes, changing git is pointless.
[22:02:32] <JordiGH> I can't even talk to people because they think of everything in terms of git words.
[22:02:46] <drobilla> Right, but it seems like your only concrete point is that the word is bad?
[22:02:58] <ngoldbaum> JordiGH is in detached HEAD state
[22:03:01] <JordiGH> No... I explain something and you think "oh yeah, git rebase, I do that all the time in magit".

[22:03:41] <drobilla> (and because magit I don't type the word "rebase" while doing so anyway)
[22:04:01] <JordiGH> drobilla: The goal isn't the point. it's the way of doing it. I know people can interactively rewrite commits in git. The interface for it is not as nice as what I'm trying to describe.
[22:04:11] <ngoldbaum> the problem is the easiest way to explain the details of this stuff is with a series of graph diagrams
[22:04:18] <ngoldbaum> which is irc is great for
[22:04:30] <drobilla> JordiGH: Sure, but I don't think any command line interface could actually be good at this anyway
[22:04:35] <companion_cube> I mean, yeah, I do `git rebase -i` in a terminal, and it's not great
[22:04:39] <JordiGH> drobilla: OH BUT IT IS
[22:04:47] <drobilla> JordiGH: e.g. a huge part of it is being able to jump to code and stage little bits and such
[22:04:50] <drobilla> JordiGH: I promise you it isn't ;)
[22:04:50] <JordiGH> Well, idk, there's some curses, which is TUI and not CLI, I guess.
[22:05:08] <ngoldbaum> yeah hg has a curses TUI for this stuff built in
[22:05:15] <ngoldbaum> it’s like it comes with magit
[22:05:18] <JordiGH> No, it really is. I tried magit. I don't miss it at all. It's so much nicer to be able to move around by typing things.
[22:05:42] <ngoldbaum> git-crecord on github is the git port of the TUI
[22:05:48] <ngoldbaum> i use it with git
[22:05:51] <drobilla> Like, I push enter on bits of a diff and I go to that code.  I highlight bits in a diff and press 's' to stage them.  No command line interface that makes me manually dick around and try to find stuff in my editor, and try to somehow stage little fragments of it could ever hope to compete
[22:05:52] <companion_cube> I wish the mercurial people would just do a nicer git UI
[22:06:01] <drobilla> (I do use git from the command line sometimes, but not for this)
[22:06:27] <ngoldbaum> drobilla: you’re describing what the curses TUI does :)
[22:06:37] <ngoldbaum> magit is nice too
[22:06:39] <JordiGH> companion_cube: hgit is in pepretual beta.
[22:07:01] <drobilla> ngoldbaum: Fair enough
[22:07:14] <ngoldbaum> https://github.com/andrewshadura/git-crecord
[22:07:23] <drobilla> I think the grander theme here is that git is not the problem, though, and a replacement (Mercurial in this case) doesn't really address it directly
[22:07:46] <drobilla> That said, I understand that I'm One Of Those Emacs People
[22:07:56] <JordiGH> drobilla: Yeah, git is impossible to replace.
[22:08:01] <drobilla> Watching other people clunk around with shitty external version control tools is like watching people program by banging rocks together, it's brutal
[22:08:13] <ngoldbaum> i mean, it does address it directly, you don’t need to use emacs to access The Good UI
[22:08:37] <ngoldbaum> hg has its own problems though
[22:08:37] <companion_cube> you just need to use a now-pretty-obscure VCS instead of git
[22:08:55] <ngoldbaum> because Matt Mackall is really opinionated and stubborn
[22:09:34] <technomancy> git is like markdown or english
[22:09:41] <technomancy> (very bad but it doesn't matter)
[22:10:11] <drobilla> I think of it more as the UI being bad, but it doesn't matter
[22:10:27] <technomancy> sure; there are underlying good ideas
[22:10:29] <drobilla> The guts of git itself being far and away better than any alternatives at the time is precisely why it won
[22:10:56] <technomancy> eeehhhhh no
[22:11:01] <drobilla> It's unfortunate that https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/ is really hard to tell from a real one sometimes, but such is life
[22:11:03] <ngoldbaum> nah, it won because github took off
[22:11:07] <technomancy> technical merits did not factor into its success
[22:11:08] <deadk> i think git's UI is objectively bad. its underlying model is not; people just like to argue about why their model is the best
[22:11:17] <companion_cube> technomancy: partly at least
[22:11:24] <companion_cube> speed was part of its success
[22:11:28] <drobilla> ^ this
[22:11:29] <ngoldbaum> VC money had way more to do with it than any technical decision
[22:11:33] <technomancy> companion_cube: very indirectly
[22:11:37] <companion_cube> oh no
[22:11:40] <companion_cube> it was a big argument
[22:11:46] <drobilla> A certain brand of programmer wanker really really wants to pretend that speed doesn't matter.  They are wrong. ;)
[22:11:46] <companion_cube> at least for me that was the upside to svn
[22:11:50] <companion_cube> like, fuck svn
[22:11:52] <technomancy> you could say it had good ideas and that's what caused the github founders to pick it over darcs or whatever
[22:11:54] <companion_cube> it's slow
[22:11:57] <technomancy> but that's a stretch
[22:12:11] <companion_cube> they could have picked mercurial I guess
[22:12:12] <technomancy> companion_cube: oh yeah I'm not saying vs SVN; that's a very low bar
[22:12:14] <companion_cube> not sure why they didn't
[22:12:20] <companion_cube> well svn was the big thing
[22:12:22] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: linux kernel
[22:12:28] <companion_cube> we've had this discussion
[22:12:37] <companion_cube> apparently the ruby community also went big on git
[22:12:37] <technomancy> I'm just glad tla didn't win because its UI is somehow even worse
[22:12:42] <companion_cube> :D
[22:12:46] <drobilla> (to be fair the large file situation is a mess though)
[22:12:53] <ngoldbaum> linus doing a fait accompli switching the kernel to git swayed a lot of people early on
[22:13:13] <technomancy> in Emacs there would be branches and it'd be like "well I want to merge this but Miles is on vacation and he's the only one who knows tla so I guess it'll have to wait"
[22:13:37] <JordiGH> ngoldbaum: I think Matt saying "no" is the only reason that hg ever had a good UI.
[22:13:47] <JordiGH> "Can I just add another option?"
[22:13:53] <JordiGH> Matt said, "no."
[22:13:56] <ngoldbaum> was bzr an improvement over the old status quo?
[22:13:59] <JordiGH> "How about we make a DSL query language instead?"
[22:14:08] <JordiGH> matt said "now you get it"
[22:14:25] <ngoldbaum> sure, but that doesn’t mean all of matt’s opinions were good for the project in the end
[22:14:30] <technomancy> ngoldbaum: yes, bzr was much better than svn
[22:15:17] <technomancy> ngoldbaum: ironically it got a bad reputation partly because it was "the official GNU vcs" and people got forced to use it even tho they hated it
[22:15:20] <ngoldbaum> like putting all the nice features of hg behind configuration knobs was probably a mistake
[22:16:03] <JordiGH> It made sense when hg was trying to grow. But yeah, it would have been nice to just leave it all on.
[22:17:51] <deadk> i'm sure it's just because i learned git first, but hg has always just felt like git with worse defaults, missing features and too much magic

[22:40:21] <companion_cube> not long term, personally
[22:41:15] <drobilla> Fair enough.  I love me some boat sleepin'
[22:44:19] <indigo> hg has felt like a breath of fresh air compared to git
[22:46:18] <indigo> drobilla: IMO speed definitely does matter, with the caveat of diminishing returns
[22:49:35] <ngoldbaum> aiui the version of hg used internally at google has been heavily configured to be so nice
[22:49:42] <drobilla> indigo: Sure.  It particularly matters up to the point of being noticeable for typical user actions (and a bit of a wank past that)
[22:50:03] <ngoldbaum> the out of the box experience is less nice :/
[22:51:00] <drobilla> Just a wee bit of perceptible lagginess has a really big effect on the "feel" of a piece of software.  It's a bit nebulous, but it's real
[22:51:56] <drobilla> Even if it's fake.  e.g. in GUIs "time to showing window" matters a bunch, and you can mitigate that by showing a bullshit window as early as possible

[23:00:40] <indigo> Eg. upon initially loading Facebook or Discord
