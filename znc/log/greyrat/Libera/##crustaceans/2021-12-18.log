[01:04:54] <gwozniak> Mainly because most people have little interest in programming their machines
[01:13:27] <manicennui> I have a feeling that these people are not actually talking about "everyone".
[01:13:35] <manicennui> Which is a common geek flaw.
[01:14:50] <manicennui> They are either only talking about other geeks, or they have some delusional model of the average person.

[16:03:55] <dcz_> am I really that weird for wanting mouse buttons on laptops?
[16:06:01] <dcz_> I can't find one that would increase the RAM but not the size compared to the 8 years old one I'm using now
[16:14:11] <Brekkjern> You mean like physical buttons rather than pushing down on the touchpad to activate it?
[16:16:06] <dcz_> that's what I mean exactly
[16:17:40] <dcz_> in the worst case, I don't *need* more RAM I guess...
[16:17:46] <Brekkjern> The surface I have has buttons, but they are not visibly separated. You just push down on the lower left for a left click, or the lower right for right click
[16:18:33] <dcz_> can you feel which button you're clicking if you press near the middle?
[16:19:25] <Brekkjern> You can't push down in the lower middle of the pad. That's where it tilts.
[16:20:08] <dcz_> that's actually not terrible, thanks for elightening me
[16:20:22] <Brekkjern> It's an old model though, so...
[16:20:22] <dcz_> which model it is?
[16:20:28] <Brekkjern> Surface Pro 3
[16:20:43] <Brekkjern> And it has the release version of the keyboard. They might have changed it later.
[16:21:09] <Brekkjern> I was just curious about what you meant really :P
[16:21:37] <Brekkjern> I'd recommend going with the laptop versions rather than the pros. The formfactor is a bit annoying on the go IMO.
[16:21:55] <dcz_> what's the difference in pros?
[16:22:21] <Brekkjern> The pro is a tablet with a detachable folding keyboard. It has a kickstand to remain upright.
[16:23:03] <dcz_> I can see the failure modes from here
[16:23:03] <Brekkjern> The "book" models and I believe the laptop too have detachable keyboards, so you can use it as a tablet, but it can also remain upright using the hinge between the keyboard and monitor part.
[16:23:18] <Brekkjern> The build quality is pretty damn good though
[16:23:32] <Brekkjern> Microsoft basically just went "If any of you OEMs aren't gonna make a decent laptop, we will."
[16:24:10] <Brekkjern> But things that are important to me might not be important to you, so YMMV.
[16:25:44] <dcz_> given the difficulty of finding a match for my basic requirements, things like build quality take a back seat now...

[17:51:26] <dcz_> in the extended saga... although heartbleed was not a buffer overflow, was it?

[21:29:18] <companion_cube> :-¬∞
[21:29:30] <riv> this is literally what went wrong, ImageIO figures out the type of file from its data - not from the extension
[21:29:42] <bkero> The mismatch is what went wrong
[21:29:57] <bkero> in addition to that parser being run in a context outside the sandbox
[21:30:21] <bkero> So ImageIO did the correct thing

[21:33:10] <ngoldbaum> trusting the file extension to be correct and then users start getting confusing errors (particularly in the mac ecosystem where extensions are hidden by default) would be a major ux regression

[21:39:30] <bkero> it also failed to run the file through an antivirus or a sandbox if available to validate that it doesn't contain malicious data
[21:39:31] <dimadima> i'm with bkero on extensions...
[21:39:40] <edm> team
[21:39:59] <edm> i am watching ‚ÄúAll The President‚Äôs Men‚Äù
[21:40:15] <dimadima> parsing in general, tricky business
[21:40:27] <dimadima> determing how you parse based on user input seems like a bad idea
[21:40:28] <edm> in response to a probing question by woodward/bernstein the guy on the phone says
[21:40:40] <edm> ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bullshit question, that‚Äôs a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.‚Äù
[21:40:44] <ngoldbaum> riv: you‚Äôre being a dick, fwiw
[21:40:51] <edm> for the americans here, what does that mean
[21:41:11] <edm> it has lots of assumed cultural baggage that i don‚Äôt have
[21:41:34] <imode> what the fuck is happening in here.
[21:41:42] <riv> ngoldbaum: <bkero>	It's a good thing you don't work at Apple Security then + <bkero>	You must be from Windows land
[21:42:10] <ngoldbaum> sorry, you‚Äôre being *more* of a dick
[21:42:16] <dimadima> edm: who knows
[21:42:19] <dcz_> I'm calling theinternet police
[21:42:19] <ngoldbaum> https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=2381911&itype=CMSID
[21:42:19] <buttsbot> Debate: The anniversary of the biggest laugh Robert Redford ever got ...  - The Salt Lake Tribune
[21:42:27] <ngoldbaum> edm: ^
[21:42:41] <riv> ngoldbaum: also 18:03:48	<riv>	it's funny how ppl are experts - and start trying to put others down - after reading 1 blog post
[21:42:43] <riv> 18:04:24	<bkero>	it's funny how ppl assume others read 1 blog post
[21:42:50] <riv> very immature...
[21:43:14] <ngoldbaum> edm: actually sorry i think it‚Äôs just that wichita is a cow town
[21:43:14] <dimadima> it's worth at least putting a file through something like https://github.com/sindresorhus/file-type
[21:43:15] <buttsbot> GitHub - sindresorhus/file-type: Detect the file type of a Buffer/Uint8Array/ArrayBuffer
[21:43:24] <dimadima> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)#Magic_numbers_in_files
[21:43:24] <buttsbot> Magic number (programming) - Wikipedia
[21:43:25] <ngoldbaum> so it‚Äôs so bullshit it comes from wichita
[21:43:30] <edm> ngoldbaum: that‚Äôs probably the most splendid non-answer i‚Äôve ever got
[21:43:45] <edm> is it just that it‚Äôs sort of an euphemism for bum-fuck nowhere?
[21:43:52] <edm> low journalistic standards etxc
[21:43:55] <edm> etc*
[21:43:59] <ngoldbaum> no it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs specifically *bull*shit
[21:43:59] <dimadima> probably yes
[21:44:04] <ngoldbaum> and wichita has a lot of bulls
[21:44:11] <dimadima> i don't think other than that wichita is known for anything
[21:44:18] <dimadima> it's coastal elites shitting on the heartland, man
[21:44:32] <ngoldbaum> it‚Äôs literally a joke about cow crap
[21:44:38] <edm> oh i see
[21:44:43] <edm> that makes some sense
[21:45:08] <imode> is the argument here that you can't deduce file types from magic bytes.
[21:45:21] <dimadima> heh "Headers in ZIP files begin with "PK" (50 4B), the initials of Phil Katz"
[21:45:47] <dimadima> that's not arguable cause you certainly can't deduce file type from anything except parsing, really, right
[21:45:49] <ngoldbaum> imode: working around the existence of sufficiently cursed files that lie about what kind of file they are?
[21:46:06] <dimadima> but using user input to dictate parsing seems even worse
[21:46:08] <edm> so it might be a sort of equivalent of someone saying [in the uk] ‚Äòthat‚Äôs the cheesiest chat-up line i‚Äôve heard outside of Stilton‚Äô?
[21:46:15] <ngoldbaum> yeah
[21:46:15] <dimadima> hhaha
[21:46:20] <dimadima> what's Stilton known for
[21:46:29] <edm> [we don‚Äôt say that here, but that‚Äôs which i am thinking might be an anaolgy]
[21:46:35] <edm> dimadima: the cheese!
[21:46:37] <bkero> Maybe Cheddar would be more universally understood there
[21:46:40] <imode> the inclusion of those bytes is good for things parsing non-malicious/user-submitted files. that's about it.
[21:46:40] <dimadima> hahahhaah
[21:47:01] <dimadima> imode: non-malicious/user-submitted are opposites?
[21:47:13] <dimadima> edm: yes, the cheese.
[21:47:23] <imode> dimadima: non-(malicious/user submitted)
[21:47:25] <bkero> imode: totally. It doesn't handle malicious files, but you could say that's a different problem that's endemic to parsing files whether or not you're doing it by magic or extension
[21:47:39] <edm> righto, ty ngoldbaum and dimadima
[21:47:42] <manicennui> edm: Wichita began as a trading post on the Chisholm Trail in the 1860s and was incorporated as a city in 1870. It became a destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to Kansas railroads, earning it the nickname "Cowtown".[10][11]
[21:47:44] <imode> it's equivalent to a bag of JSON having the "type" field.
[21:47:53] <manicennui> edm: I had to look that up though, and I live in the Midwest.
[21:47:56] <imode> the field is a hint at what it might be.
[21:48:01] <imode> not what it is.
[21:48:06] <manicennui> Frankly, no one talks about Witchita and we look down on Kansas.
[21:48:12] <companion_cube> If it was a pdf disguised as a gif, and the user clicks on it, the vulnerability kicks in anyway
[21:48:29] <bkero> That goes from 0 clicks to 1 click though
[21:48:34] <companion_cube> I don't know about that sandbox though, why is stuff done outside of it
[21:48:35] <bkero> and yeah, PDF exploits are still very real
[21:48:36] <manicennui> edm: It isn't a second or even third-tier city.
[21:48:37] <dimadima> imode: ahh
[21:48:39] <companion_cube> Yes, that's true
[21:48:46] <manicennui> edm: It's a place that might be less bad than other parts of Kansas.
[21:48:57] <companion_cube> But people will click anyway
[21:48:58] <edm> i‚Äôm watching All the President‚Äôs Men for the 1067‚Äôth time as it‚Äôs such a splendid film, but i‚Äôm now sort of unapologetically trying to explicitly understand all the previous things i have not really understood but inferred from context
[21:49:08] <companion_cube> Give it a good file name and they won't resist
[21:49:20] <bkero> that_thing_you_want.gif
[21:49:39] <companion_cube> funny_cat _meme.gif
[21:50:03] <bkero> now we're getting somewhere
[21:50:06] <imode> my_nft_do_not_steal.gif
[21:50:09] <companion_cube> (oh no I put a space, shell scripts be fucked)
[21:50:43] <bkero> imode: careful that could have polymorphic contents like what block it was mined in, or some sort of public key
[21:50:56] <bkero> Or they could implement a crypto miner in JBIG2
[21:51:07] <bkero> They've got the gates after all
[21:51:51] <manicennui> edm: I haven't seen that. Have you seen Frost/Nixon?
[21:51:56] <bkero> That would be kind of impressive. Implement the most implausible (?) LLVM backend ever: compile to JBIG2 recursive noising.
[21:52:01] <edm> manicennui:
[21:52:06] <edm> whooops
[21:52:13] <edm> yes i have - it‚Äô[s very good
[21:52:20] <edm> but i thing ATPM is really supoerb
[21:52:26] <edm> superb*
[21:52:30] <edm> one for the time capsule
[21:53:25] <manicennui> We need to make more films about the bullshit Reagan did.
[21:53:52] <edm> i‚Äôd have assumed that ships has sailed
[21:54:02] <manicennui> Surprised that there isn't even a famous film trying to make him look good.
[21:54:10] <edm> having said that, presumably there‚Äôs something of a rehab programme going on
[21:54:13] <manicennui> Probably because right-wing assholes don't make art.
[21:54:17] <ngoldbaum> tom cruise made a shitty iran contra movie
[21:54:22] <edm> bullshitting is patriotic actually, etc
[21:54:57] <manicennui> edm: I'd argue that his impact and the impact of people like him are exactly why the US is the way it is now.
[21:55:09] <manicennui> The extreme corporatism, etc.
[21:55:23] <edm> but im not sure films will make a difference
[21:55:37] <edm> or maybe everuthing would be much worse if it wasn;t for ATPM
[21:55:38] <manicennui> No, but I'd like to see him knocked down a peg or two.
[21:56:28] <manicennui> Nixon actually suffered consequences for his asshattery.
[21:56:30] <ngoldbaum> looooool https://twitter.com/kelloggsus/status/1471879864479367172
[21:56:30] <buttsbot> Twitter - kelloggsus - @_NevadaMan Our data show that consumers routinely focus on the visual of the Pop-Tarts brand name, so we simplified the package design by removing "Kellogg's".
[21:57:27] <manicennui> Is a sugar cookie pop tart just a pop tart with more sugar and no filling?
[21:58:28] <imode> fuck kellogg.
[21:58:47] <manicennui> Fuck them because they make garbage "food".
[21:59:09] <imode> fuck them because their founder was a fucking shithead.
[21:59:24] <manicennui> imode: He just wanted you to stop beating off!
[21:59:33] <imode> he was also a eugenics proponent.
[21:59:45] <manicennui> Your masturbation is tearing us apart!
[21:59:53] <edm> this feels like an argument about amazon
[21:59:55] <imode> he literally wanted people to stop feeling joy.
[22:00:03] <imode> to live longer.
[22:00:09] <edm> it‚Äôs so easy to not give them your money
[22:00:20] <manicennui> edm: Kellogs owns a shitload of companies.
[22:00:23] <bontaq> lmao cool guy.  fuck kellogg++
[22:00:27] <edm> i have managed it for about 2 years
[22:00:28] <edm> manicennui:
[22:00:29] <manicennui> And many Americans consume processed food.
[22:00:30] <edm> name them all
[22:00:49] <edm> i am 95% sure i won‚Äôt have given thema cent
[22:00:50] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellogg's#Products
[22:00:50] <buttsbot> Kellogg - Wikipedia
[22:01:30] <imode> huh. I haven't given them any money.
[22:02:34] <edm> pringles is the only thing on that list i‚Äôm at risk of buying and i think it must have been several years since i‚Äôve bought any
[22:02:38] <manicennui> It's not like their competitors are great.
[22:02:43] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabisco#Brands_and_products
[22:02:43] <buttsbot> Nabisco - Wikipedia
[22:02:48] <edm> but i concede it‚Äôs hard to know who owns what
[22:03:41] <ngoldbaum> especially when they remove their logo to avoid botcotts
[22:04:00] <manicennui> The only way that I might buy a product from one of these companies is if it is relabeled for Whole Foods or Trader Joe's or something.
[22:04:19] <imode> who owns nutty buddy.
[22:04:31] <edm> yes and if [uk equivalent] waitrose were to OEM kellog stuff i might be in trouble
[22:04:32] <manicennui> But that is unlikely because I don't typically buy products with a fuckton of ingredients.
[22:04:58] <manicennui> edm: I'm sure the UK has its own horrible companies.
[22:05:01] <edm> but likewise i like cooking and generally bread is the most processed thing i buy
[22:05:10] <imode> little debbie.
[22:05:17] <edm> manicennui: sure, but i apply the same principles to them
[22:05:33] <edm> this isn‚Äôt a kellog chat it‚Äôs a baddiesa chat
[22:06:06] <edm> Tate & Lyle is probably our obvious baddie
[22:06:11] <imode> I'm okay with McKee Foods. they make some bangin shit.
[22:06:19] <manicennui> Little Debbie personally committed genocide to acquire the nutty bars.
[22:06:45] <imode> "personally"
[22:06:49] <edm> but i am glad to hear of another obvious baddie I‚Äôve been unknowingly funding
[22:06:55] <manicennui> In the nutty bar fields of Nuttyland.
[22:07:21] <imode> are nutty bars a naturally occurring resource.
[22:07:31] <manicennui> I'm at the point where I know I need to just cook everything from whole ingredients.
[22:07:33] <manicennui> And I have the time.
[22:07:35] <imode> and if so, are they renewable.
[22:07:56] <manicennui> Nutty bar ingredients: nutty bars.
[22:08:07] <imode> the floor here is made out of floor.
[22:08:54] <edm> but I‚Äôm _moderately_ confident I‚Äôm in a reasonable position on this front. I have a local vegetable man who buys locally where he can, I have a really good butcher and fishmonger who are very serious about sustainable and organic stuff, and the resultant price means i don‚Äôt have it too much, i avoid anything processed
[22:09:20] <manicennui> Another pure evil company to avoid: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands
[22:09:20] <buttsbot> List of Nestl√© brands - Wikipedia
[22:09:54] <edm> manicennui: nestle was the ‚Äòbritish‚Äô company i was going to tell u i avoided
[22:10:01] <edm> till i read just now they were swiss
[22:10:20] <manicennui> In a couple decades we'll have the water wars for Nestle.
[22:10:41] <imode> the only thing I buy from nestle is dog food.
[22:10:42] <edm> my grandad was a rep for his park of the uk for nestle
[22:10:52] <manicennui> Blue bottle seems to be somewhat popular with geeks.
[22:10:55] <edm> so it‚Äôs not entirely impersonal
[22:10:59] <manicennui> Didn't even realize they were a Nestle company
[22:11:11] <bkero> Hiss
[22:11:46] <dimadima> imode: what is the correct way to handle user-submitted files
[22:11:53] <dimadima> in terms of parsing
[22:11:54] <imode> dimadima: never do anything to them.
[22:11:54] <bkero> I did chance upon some of their beans in a drink can. Those were surprisingly fresh and decent. I think they pumped the fan full of nitrogen before sealing.
[22:12:04] <imode> or hand them to a library behind a wall of iron.
[22:12:16] <ngoldbaum> give the files a stern talking to
[22:12:20] <bkero> https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/File_Upload_Cheat_Sheet.html seems to cover that pretty well
[22:12:21] <buttsbot> File Upload - OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
[22:12:24] <bkero> less jokes in there though
[22:12:25] <ngoldbaum> they should know better than be exploits
[22:13:11] <ngoldbaum> imode: so i should just shell out to imagemagick or ffmpeg like google does?
[22:13:24] <imode> pretty much.
[22:13:35] <imode> keep that fucker up to date.
[22:16:13] <manicennui> Nestle owns Haagen Dazs. =/
[22:16:27] <imode> I don't buy ice cream.
[22:16:30] <edm> woah woah woah
[22:16:43] <edm> let‚Äôs not be throwing shade on ffmpeg
[22:16:43] <dimadima> how come
[22:16:44] <bkero> Let's not cream-shame anyone here
[22:17:10] <imode> edm: who's throwing shade?
[22:17:20] <manicennui> Oh, this page is out of date.
[22:17:23] <manicennui> " In December 2019, Nestl√© sold Dreyer's along with its rights in the H√§agen-Dazs brand to Froneri, a joint venture set up by Nestl√© and PAI Partners in 2016."
[22:17:35] <imode> "a joint venture"
[22:17:35] <ngoldbaum> mmm love cara caras
[22:17:38] <edm> neil be roping him into bants
[22:17:48] <manicennui> So I guess they partially own it.
[22:17:55] <imode> avoid 'em anyway.
[22:18:03] <imode> go buy mochi icecream.
[22:18:13] <dimadima> what's wrong with ice cream
[22:18:25] <ngoldbaum> mochi ice cream is so overpriced
[22:18:25] <manicennui> We have local gelato and frozen custard shops.
[22:18:51] <manicennui> But I haven't been eating much ice cream and such lately.
[22:19:23] <ngoldbaum> there‚Äôs a really good small-batch ice cream place about a mile from me
[22:19:35] <ngoldbaum> we only talk to it :)
[22:19:36] <manicennui> Jesus Nestle owns a lot.
[22:19:53] <ngoldbaum> s/talk/walk
[22:20:03] <manicennui> "Tidy Cats"
[22:20:05] <manicennui> Nooo!
[22:20:12] <manicennui> Not that I have a cat anymore.
[22:20:33] <ngoldbaum> now what will you clean vomit up with
[22:20:41] <ngoldbaum> some off-brand kitty litter?
[22:20:42] <edm> who are the large-batch icecream people we should be avoiding
[22:20:43] <ngoldbaum> smh
[22:21:00] <dimadima> well in the US much "ice cream" is no longer actually ice cream
[22:21:12] <dimadima> if you look at edy's, it says iced dessert or something like that
[22:21:32] <manicennui> edm: If you want to avoid Nestle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands#Frozen_desserts
[22:21:32] <buttsbot> List of Nestl√© brands - Wikipedia
[22:21:52] <ngoldbaum> in terms of national ice cream brands i like ben and jerry‚Äôs although it‚Äôs a tad expensive
[22:22:31] <manicennui> How long after they die do you think their children will sell out to a conglomerate?
[22:22:50] <manicennui> " it was sold in 2000 to British conglomerate Unilever"
[22:22:52] <manicennui> Oh.
[22:23:22] <imode> ngoldbaum: use pine litter.
[22:23:30] <imode> thank me later.
[22:23:51] <manicennui> The Unilever page has large sections on environmental problems and controversies.
[22:24:11] <ngoldbaum> i think ben and jerry‚Äôs has some amount of independence?
[22:24:19] <bkero> A lot more I believe
[22:24:29] <imode> it's almost like every corporation is so large that it's wasteful, damaging and overall harmful for them to exist.
[22:24:31] <ngoldbaum> they can do things like decide to stop distributing to israeli settlements in the west bank
[22:24:38] <edm> manicennui:
[22:24:40] <manicennui> "Mercury contamination", "Palm oil", "Plastic pollution", "Salmonella contamination"
[22:24:43] <edm> blimey
[22:24:52] <imode> burn down corporate.
[22:25:02] <manicennui> "Price-fixing", "Pressuring media to promote skin whiteners"
[22:25:09] <manicennui> Sounds like a great company.
[22:25:22] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unilever_brands
[22:25:22] <buttsbot> List of Unilever brands - Wikipedia
[22:25:36] <edm> so i  was teeing up to smugly tell you i have not had a single nestle product since being a concious adult [whatever than means, but let‚Äôs say the last several years]
[22:25:49] <edm> but having read that
[22:25:58] <edm> i really love san pellegrino
[22:26:02] <manicennui> I've definitely had Perrier.
[22:26:05] <manicennui> And a couple others.
[22:26:06] <edm> i am drinking it preciesly right now
[22:26:17] <edm> and there it is, a nestle product
[22:26:27] <imode> who owns v8
[22:26:35] <imode> campbells
[22:26:38] <dimadima> the proletariat
[22:26:42] <bkero> I think I've been free of nestle products
[22:26:43] <manicennui> Campbell
[22:26:49] <bkero> Gonna have to go through all their products to see though
[22:27:03] <bkero> Jesus there are a lot
[22:27:24] <edm> bkero: good luck
[22:27:44] <manicennui> These conglomerates are smart enough to buy up good brands too.
[22:27:58] <manicennui> I noticed that Nestle owns several pet food brands that are considered really good.
[22:28:32] <manicennui> At some point it probably depends on how much Nestle leaves them alone.
[22:28:36] <dimadima> here's a slug https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/16/health/brazil-obesity-nestle.html
[22:28:40] <manicennui> And how much you care about Nestle benefitting from their profits.
[22:28:57] <bkero> edm: I think I did it. But jesus I can understand how tough it is given all the brands on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands
[22:28:57] <buttsbot> List of Nestl√© brands - Wikipedia
[22:29:51] <manicennui> Even worse than Nestle is the governments who allow them to create fucked up situations with water supplies.
[22:30:14] <bkero> They're both bad
[22:30:29] <bkero> If only California had the cojones to tell them to fuck off
[22:30:43] <manicennui> bkero: The government is basically the one entity who can put a stop to their practices.
[22:30:48] <bkero> (and all the other places they're extracting resources without paying for the externalities of those resources being gone)
[22:31:00] <bkero> manicennui: or their shareholders
[22:31:04] <manicennui> We literally elect these assholes to deal with these kinds of things.
[22:31:49] <bkero> You might vote for assholes to deal with those sorts of things, but honestly I've seen very few on the ballots, and even fewer make it into office
[22:31:57] <bkero> and when they do get there they're surrounded by people on the payroll
[22:32:02] <manicennui> bkero: It would take an activist investor buying up a big stake in the company and forcing such an issue for anything to happen.
[22:32:10] <bkero> Yup
[22:32:15] <bkero> We saw that recently with Twitter
[22:32:25] <bkero> How many Nestles fit into 1 Twitter's market cap?
[22:32:40] <dimadima> what happened w/ twitter
[22:32:47] <ngoldbaum> jack got forced out
[22:33:07] <manicennui> I don't even know how that works with Nestle. They are listed on multiple markets.

[22:33:54] <ngoldbaum> but for real being CEO or twitter and square simultaneously is insane
[22:34:49] <manicennui> bkero: What I believe to be their main listing has a market cap of 350.244B
[22:35:11] <manicennui> 10x Twitter
[22:36:02] <manicennui> It would probably be easier to just buy the water company in question.
[22:36:24] <bkero> Something's bigger than a tech company? Damn.
[22:38:12] <imode> oil.
[22:39:00] <ngoldbaum> aramco is ~2 Apple‚Äôs
[22:39:04] <ngoldbaum> by market cap
[22:39:56] <ngoldbaum> also i‚Äôve been seeing aramco ads that have nothing to do with oil and have vaguely positive messages on the internet lately which is big MBS energy
[22:40:21] <imode> shove them into the oil pits.
[22:41:33] <edm> bkero: yes it‚Äôs tough isn‚Äôt it
[22:41:59] <edm> we shouldn‚Äôt beat oursel;ves up too much for buying one single thing on this list
[22:42:06] <edm> it‚Äôs all stats
[22:42:13] <edm> not religion
[22:42:41] <edm> we should just mostly avoid them as much as possible, know that we wont burn in hell for the odd lapse
[22:42:54] <bkero> That's a pragmatic approach I can agree with
[22:43:12] <bkero> I have enough choices around here where I can actually make those choices. Some aren't so lucky.
[22:43:24] <imode> my dog won't eat anything else and live to tell the tale.
[22:43:34] <imode> so purina one is an unfortunate inclusion.
[22:43:50] <bkero> imode: as a compromise could you feed Nestle executives to your dog?
[22:44:00] <ngoldbaum> wow JWST actually launching in less than a week
[22:44:08] <edm> i think if you mostly buy local food, seasonally, and try to avoid too much processed stuff, you are reinforcing the vector on the side of good rather than evil
[22:44:09] <imode> she needs grains.
[22:44:12] <ngoldbaum> (5% chance of exploding)
[22:44:18] <manicennui> edm: I think it is better to try to fundamentally change how we eat.
[22:44:21] <imode> ngoldbaum: so it'll explode.
[22:44:26] <edm> even if u you can‚Äôt be perfect
[22:44:29] <manicennui> Basically cook more, buy local products, etc.
[22:44:41] <manicennui> But yeah, don't beat yourself up about everything.
[22:45:10] <edm> ngoldbaum: it‚Äôs thrilling isn‚Äôt it
[22:45:12] <imode> I didn't want to cook two days ago so I bought a full 4-person taco bar from a local mexican place.
[22:45:12] <edm> JWST
[22:45:12] <manicennui> And of course this ignores the large portion of the population who doesn't have time or options.
[22:45:13] <bkero> It's a good thing Nestle doesn't make beer
[22:45:18] <bkero> else I'd probably have lapsed in there somewhere
[22:45:20] <edm> it‚Äôs an amazing machine
[22:45:29] <manicennui> bkero: Most beer is owned by two companies.
[22:45:32] <imode> everything was and is amazing.
[22:45:35] <bkero> manicennui: I live in Oregon :)
[22:45:37] <manicennui> Fortunately there are a ton of local breweries in most areas.
[22:45:48] <ngoldbaum> it‚Äôll be less amazing if the sunshield doesn‚Äôt unfold
[22:45:55] <bkero> I think the beer from the largest brewery in my fridge is Cantillion
[22:45:56] <manicennui> bkero: A lot of famous Oregon breweries are owned by the big two.
[22:46:04] <imode> but what was jarring was the prep work that would've been involved and the cost of the ingredients. it cost less to order that mass of food fully prepared than the ingredients themselves and do the prep myself.
[22:46:08] <imode> and it's better quality.
[22:46:09] <bkero> manicennui: the ones famous outside Oregon are, yeah
[22:46:34] <bkero> Craft Beer Alliance is still independent I think (Kona, Widmer, Red Hook)
[22:46:51] <bkero> and was made explicitly for this purpose back in 2008
[22:47:12] <manicennui> bkero: Parent organization: Anheuser-Busch
[22:47:13] <bkero> Ah damn, nope. AB Inbev
[22:47:19] <edm> ngoldbaum: for sure it will be
[22:47:21] <edm> but also
[22:47:37] <edm> skycrane has reshaped the odds surely?
[22:47:48] <edm> that was mush more batship
[22:47:48] <bkero> manicennui: Independent breweries actually have a really common logo they put on labels here
[22:47:52] <edm> batshit*
[22:48:03] <ngoldbaum> it‚Äôs just a lot of moving parts in a vacuum that all have to work correctly
[22:48:15] <edm> so whilst JWST can still fail, it doesn‚Äôt feel reckless by comparison
[22:48:25] <imode> why are we excited about JWST.
[22:48:31] <edm> science!
[22:48:36] <imode> in the name of what.
[22:48:43] <imode> what are we solving, here.
[22:48:46] <ngoldbaum> imode: there are a bunch of fundamental astronomy and cosmology questions that it will answer
[22:48:52] <edm> it‚Äôs a proper order of magnitude improvement as a scientific instrument
[22:48:54] <manicennui> imode: Looking for new planets to rek.
[22:49:00] <imode> ngoldbaum: cool. why.
[22:49:10] <ngoldbaum> like directly imaging plents, the first stars, the first galaxies
[22:49:28] <imode> will any of this lead to our non-extinction as a species.
[22:49:37] <ngoldbaum> because you need an IR telescope to see the earliest stars at extreme redshifts (z~10 or higher)
[22:49:57] <imode> I don't care. I'm sorry to say that, but I stopped caring when I realized that the science doesn't matter.
[22:50:01] <edm> imode: what position are you argueing from here. is it just that fundamental research isn‚Äôt worth the money or?
[22:50:02] <ngoldbaum> which means it has to be in space
[22:50:08] <bkero> https://beerconnoisseur.com/sites/default/files/articles/2017/brewer039s_association_launches_quotindependent_craftquot_seal/ba.png
[22:50:14] <ngoldbaum> and no one has flown this big of an IR telescope before
[22:50:31] <ngoldbaum> science is fundamental until it‚Äôs not
[22:50:35] <imode> edm: what fundamental research will this forward that has a direct benefit to humanity other than "we can see this thing now".
[22:50:43] <bkero> In the wild: https://i.bke.ro/selif/lae93ca5.jpg
[22:50:54] <imode> or "we now know how the early universe looked".
[22:50:55] * ngoldbaum says typing into a square of glass that wouldn‚Äôt work without a thorough understanding of quantum field theory
[22:51:04] <riv> we already figured out all the important science
[22:51:08] <edm> imode: i don‚Äôt know. but science has a good track record so far
[22:51:12] <riv> the rest is too niche to matter
[22:51:14] <imode> ngoldbaum: you will _not_ hear me arguing against QFT or anything terrestrial in invention/inspection.
[22:51:22] <edm> the same things were said about electrons ins 1905
[22:51:33] <edm> radio waves around the same time
[22:51:33] <imode> mine is more specific. if this is just an imaging tool, why all the huff.
[22:51:36] <ngoldbaum> i‚Äôm just saying i‚Äôm sure plenty of people in the 20s thought quantum mechanics was useless
[22:51:55] <riv> i was hoping for better video from the drone on mars tbh
[22:52:03] <ngoldbaum> imode: understanding the origins of the universe, what happened in the past
[22:52:05] <riv> maybe i just don't know where to find it
[22:52:10] <imode> ngoldbaum: that doesn't buy anybody anything.
[22:52:27] <edm> i am _entirely_ convinced on the utility of anything that tests fundamental physics, on a sort of century scale
[22:52:40] <imode> but this isn't testing anything fundamental..
[22:52:50] <imode> you made a better image sensor. good job. why is this important.
[22:53:09] <ngoldbaum> you don‚Äôt see how understanding where things come from could have some practical implications somehow in the future?
[22:53:12] <imode> what discoveries about fundamental physics did hubble produce that were a direct impact on our capacity for invention.
[22:53:20] <imode> not at the scale you're talking, no.
[22:53:28] <edm> i am just a humb;e engineer, on a matho, but even my field (control theory with a non-linear element) is based on Lyapunov which was purest masturbation for about 50+ years afyer he published it
[22:53:30] <edm> after*
[22:53:40] <edm> not a mathmo*
[22:54:10] <edm> and suddenly it turns out it solves all out hard problems in modern control theory
[22:54:16] <imode> edm: theoretical masturbation should be separated from practical masturbation. theories can be worked on.
[22:54:32] <edm> obviously that‚Äôs not always true but it seems to be true enough to be worth it
[22:54:33] <imode> practical masturbation is 'we built this thing to do a physical thing and it doesn't really do much other than answer a question'.
[22:55:02] <imode> what exactly does imaging ancient stars do for us other than "HOLY SHIT WE CAN SEE IT NOW"
[22:55:09] <imode> like, again, hubble. what'd that do.
[22:55:15] <imode> (I am asking in earnest.)
[22:55:16] <edm> imode: sure, but e.g. GPS entirely relies on real observations in the 30s-60s based on methoretical masturbation from einstein
[22:55:26] <ngoldbaum> informs our understanding of how we got here, as a planet and species
[22:55:31] <imode> that's not useful.
[22:55:33] <imode> at all.
[22:55:43] <edm> GPS isn‚Äôt useful?
[22:55:50] <imode> no, I was responding to ngoldbaum.
[22:55:53] <edm> understanding relativity hasn‚Äôt been useful?
[22:55:55] <imode> edm: that theoretical wank is something that's always worth investing in.
[22:55:58] <edm> respond to me
[22:56:15] <edm> science relies both on hypothesis and observation
[22:56:23] <edm> the two can‚Äôt be seperated
[22:56:32] <riv> wait
[22:56:34] <imode> "how we got here" is not a useful question unless it's used to answer another practical question.
[22:56:35] <ngoldbaum> is art useful? a novel? people sometimes do non-useful things
[22:56:37] <edm> there is arguememt about how much to spend on the the later for the former
[22:56:38] <riv> you're aguing that we should only do theory, not practice?
[22:56:40] <riv> Lol
[22:56:49] <riv> that's the opposite of what i've heard before
[22:56:56] <manicennui> imode: I think I get where you are coming from generally, but NASA's budget isn't large enough to even worry about, and three different countries are paying for this thing.
[22:56:57] <imode> forest through trees, riv. not arguing that.
[22:57:14] <imode> there are two kinds of questions that we can pose.
[22:57:35] <edm> but even a delayed slow thing like JWST is absolute bobbins compared to eg replacing the A10 thunderbolt
[22:57:43] <manicennui> Asking some geeks why they are excited about this is like asking why your favorite music is exciting and should exist.
[22:57:47] <ngoldbaum> manicennui: JWST is like 90% US-funded
[22:57:54] <ngoldbaum> because the budget exploded
[22:57:58] <edm> and it _could_ do lots to prove or disprove theoretical science
[22:57:59] <imode> "how we got here" style questions, which are of no use unless in service to answer the second type, which is "how does this thing work", which is _also_ only useful in the context of "how do we do X".
[22:58:00] <manicennui> ngoldbaum: NASA's budget is still not worth worrying about.
[22:58:13] <ngoldbaum> there is an argument to be made that JWST wasn‚Äôt a good use of NASA‚Äôs budget
[22:58:19] <imode> so unless JWST can result in a theory that lets us build warp engines, it's not useful.
[22:58:19] <ngoldbaum> given the risks and budget explosion
[22:58:37] <imode> which, given its intrinsic purpose of imaging, doesn't seem like it'll produce anything.
[22:58:39] <manicennui> imode: Over what time frame?
[22:58:43] <ngoldbaum> lol yes that is the singular way doing basic science might be useful in the future
[22:58:47] <ngoldbaum> warp drive
[22:58:47] <manicennui> What if it leads to something 200 years from now?
[22:58:51] <imode> ngoldbaum: it was an example.
[22:58:52] <riv> imode: well you remember about hubble ?
[22:58:56] <imode> riv: yes, what'd that do.
[22:58:58] <riv> when they pointed at it blank space
[22:59:03] <riv> and they found there's galaxies everywhere
[22:59:05] <riv> that's cool as fuck
[22:59:16] <manicennui> I'd like to see NASA stop spending money on manned missions.
[22:59:19] <riv> and i dont think people really expected that
[22:59:20] <manicennui> Fuck the ISS.
[22:59:25] <imode> "that's cool as fuck" is not a result I want from a gigantic fucking space project.
[22:59:28] <ngoldbaum> oh yeah
[22:59:30] <riv> why not??
[22:59:31] <imode> rather it's not the only result.
[22:59:38] <ngoldbaum> artemis is a way way bigger waste of money
[22:59:39] <imode> because that money could've been repurposed elsewhere.
[22:59:48] <ngoldbaum> it‚Äôs a jobs program not a rocket program
[22:59:49] <riv> what like, feeding people or getting them homes?
[22:59:50] <imode> for a result that would've gotten me "that's cool as fuck".
[22:59:50] <edm> yes humans in space is a waste of money
[22:59:53] <edm> for the time being
[22:59:54] <riv> that will never happen
[22:59:59] <imode> as well as something productive.
[23:00:10] <imode> "that will never happen". sure it will. when people stop finding images of galaxies interesting.
[23:00:29] <edm> but isn‚Äôt never really been about people
[23:00:32] <manicennui> We need to build mining bots to mine ice on other planets and moons for Nestle.
[23:00:45] <edm> false colour hubble images are scraps for peasants
[23:00:55] <edm> the science has always been the thing
[23:00:58] <imode> my actual, genuine question, since hubble is a thing: what discoveries from Hubble directly impacted our technological advancement.
[23:01:16] <imode> did it improve image sensors somehow.
[23:01:20] <riv> i dont think so
[23:01:29] <manicennui> imode: Is "technological advancement" important?
[23:01:31] <riv> people say how we got teflon pans from the space shuttle but they just cause cancer
[23:01:40] <imode> manicennui: why else do we do science.
[23:01:45] <manicennui> Understanding.
[23:01:58] <imode> understanding buys you nothing unless you have a goal that that understanding contributes to.
[23:02:02] <ngoldbaum> imode: IR photosensor arrays (IR CCDs aren‚Äôt a thing)
[23:02:10] <manicennui> Understanding need not be instrumental.
[23:02:16] <ngoldbaum> although not sure how much that was driven by hubble vs cruise missiles
[23:02:31] <imode> understanding is philosophical wankery unless it's applied to something.
[23:02:44] <imode> "I need to do X, therefore I need to understand X."
[23:02:50] <imode> the rest is just PR and woo.
[23:02:59] <riv> it's not woo
[23:03:02] <imode> it's pretty woo.
[23:03:05] <riv> it's just something you dont value
[23:03:07] <manicennui> imode: That's a good way to never make progress.
[23:03:09] <imode> as in, visually appealing woo.
[23:03:19] <manicennui> It is hard to know in advance what will lead to what.
[23:03:20] <imode> manicennui: what, by culling something that doesn't actually contribute to anything?
[23:03:25] <edm> but also in all this chant remember it was also about 50 years between knowing electrons existed and inventing the transistor
[23:03:29] <ngoldbaum> one reason your CPU has hardware support for floating point math is to do astrophysics calculations (also bomb calculations)
[23:03:44] <edm> and the another decade for transistors to be useful
[23:03:48] <ngoldbaum> bomb calculations and supernova calculations have a lot of overlap
[23:04:02] <ngoldbaum> one reason the national labs employ a lot of people who work on supernovae
[23:04:03] <imode> you won't hear me arguing against that.
[23:04:17] <manicennui> imode: I mean, all of the garbage "food" products we were discussing earlier are the result of science too.
[23:04:17] <edm> and only because turing and shannon luckily happened to have created the killer app for them
[23:04:18] <ngoldbaum> well all those calculations need observational input
[23:04:21] <imode> but you will hear me arguing against something like imaging things that will never impact us.
[23:04:22] <ngoldbaum> from hubble
[23:04:33] <riv> why does it have to impact us
[23:04:41] <manicennui> imode: I don't know why "technological advancement" is a good goal except in limited cases.
[23:04:49] <imode> manicennui: says the man typing on a computer.
[23:04:52] <manicennui> I'd argue that a great deal of our technology is a net negative.
[23:04:57] <imode> then leave this chatroom.
[23:05:09] <manicennui> Now you are just being silly.
[23:05:18] <imode> I'm taking your statement to a conclusion that fits it.
[23:05:32] <imode> if we're a net negative then do what you just did with nestle.
[23:05:39] <imode> fret about it and oblige yourself to cull it from your life.
[23:05:48] <manicennui> imode: A very good argument could be made for my computer activity being a bad thing.
[23:06:00] <imode> and it's one you won't listen to. :P
[23:06:12] <manicennui> imode: I never claimed that I boycott these companies.
[23:06:14] <imode> most of this conversation was really about battling biases.
[23:06:16] <edm> i suppose the summary of this chat is that I can‚Äôt prove that the current ‚Äòn‚Äô research will lead to n+1 breakthrough, but that historically funding the current ‚Äòn‚Äôs has provided the most successful human project so far. more so than religion
[23:06:20] <manicennui> I don't use most of their products because they are garbage.
[23:06:51] <imode> edm: my skepticism arises from the conclusions you could generate from imaging things that are so far off they have little impact on what we do here, on the ground, in terms of basic science.
[23:07:03] <edm> but so they?
[23:07:11] <edm> i sort of sympathise
[23:07:14] <manicennui> edm: How do you define success?
[23:07:14] <imode> it'd be one thing if you're doing things like measuring gravitational waves or providing example proofs for old theories.
[23:07:28] <edm> will the higgs boson by useful to my grandchildren? hard to argue
[23:07:32] <imode> or even establishing new ones that can be used for technological advancement.
[23:07:37] <edm> now that we know the higgs boson is reasl
[23:07:39] <edm> real*
[23:08:16] <manicennui> I'd actually be thrilled if a large portion of the government's budget were spent on "useless" understanding as long as all of it is made completely public.
[23:08:19] <imode> I'm reading the "impact" page for Hubble and I'm not seeing anything.
[23:08:29] <imode> manicennui: not while poverty exists.
[23:08:30] <edm> imode: but that example you just gave seems to be contradictory to your point
[23:08:43] <manicennui> No selling publicly funded research to companies to fuck us over with.
[23:08:44] <imode> edm: care to expand on that.
[23:08:50] <edm> gravitational waves etc are entirely what i‚Äôm talking about
[23:09:01] <imode> okay.
[23:09:14] <imode> JWST isn't validating anything else about GR iirc.
[23:09:19] <edm> the current thing in science is why is einstein wrong
[23:09:30] <edm> no but we know GR is wrong
[23:09:33] <ngoldbaum> it‚Äôs impossible to accurately predict the future course of technological progress
[23:09:39] <edm> no more validation needed
[23:09:45] <manicennui> imode: The things that would be required to eliminate poverty are things that those in power will never let happen, and don't generally require money.
[23:09:46] <imode> ngoldbaum: it is _difficult_.
[23:09:49] <imode> not impossible.
[23:10:05] <imode> manicennui: so because we're spending on useless things that makes it okay?
[23:10:12] <imode> you'd rather them burn money than give you money?
[23:10:13] <manicennui> imode: No, they are unrelated issues.
[23:10:17] <riv> there's nothing wrong with stuff being useless
[23:10:19] <edm> imode: you are incapable of making that claim
[23:10:27] <edm> you don‚Äôt know it;s useless
[23:10:28] <riv> in fact useless stuff is really good
[23:10:30] <ngoldbaum> ok well go start a hedge fund that makes money based on being a tech oracle
[23:10:31] <manicennui> Eliminating poverty requires changes in policies for the most part, not spending more money.
[23:10:41] <imode> ngoldbaum: you'll have to box larry for that.
[23:11:01] <imode> I think he legally owns Delphi.
[23:11:16] <imode> the city.
[23:11:31] <ngoldbaum> you just sound like the people who complained that faraday‚Äôs experiments with wires and currents were useless
[23:11:33] <imode> manicennui: I mean, you say that, but have we done it by spending more money yet.
[23:11:42] <imode> ngoldbaum: cool projection, that's not what I'm about.
[23:11:42] <manicennui> imode: What?
[23:12:04] <manicennui> imode: Again, it doesn't require spending more money.
[23:12:06] <edm> imode: does your objection extend to CERN or hubble or?
[23:12:12] <manicennui> It requires changing policies that those in power don't want to change.
[23:12:13] <imode> edm: yes.
[23:12:18] <imode> well, loosely for CERN.
[23:12:19] <edm> or is it specifically string theory
[23:12:29] <imode> they're throwing things at other things and seeing what comes out.
[23:12:31] <edm> oh well i can‚Äôt argue eith you then
[23:12:42] <imode> that I can get behind.
[23:12:47] <manicennui> The problem with UBI is that the necessities of life are completely fucked in our system.
[23:12:56] <manicennui> Universal healthcare would cost us less than what we have now.
[23:13:03] <imode> hubble didn't really.. provide any insight. it apparently provided manufacturing processes for new insulators and the like.
[23:13:12] <imode> but that was a byproduct, not a direct product, I guess.
[23:13:20] <manicennui> Fixing housing would require destroying real estate as an investment vehicle.
[23:13:33] <bkero> Okay
[23:13:36] <manicennui> We don't have to spend more on these things.
[23:13:41] <riv> hubble did provide insight into whats in space
[23:13:49] <manicennui> And giving people money to spend on things where others are extracting profit is crazy.
[23:13:49] <imode> that impacts no earthly invention.
[23:13:53] <riv> true
[23:13:56] <manicennui> Those things are going to continue to go up in price.
[23:14:12] <manicennui> It's higher education funding all over again.
[23:14:23] <imode> tell you what, here's my stance. I would rather _see_ these galaxies in person than _image them_ from far off. if money can be channeled from _imaging_ to _transportation development_, I want it to be.
[23:14:35] <imode> unless the _imaging_ helps the _transportation development_, it's wankery.
[23:14:51] <manicennui> imode: Now you need to justify why you need to travel there. What does that get us?
[23:14:52] <imode> the path from "we saw this in the sky" to "I can now go visit that thing in the sky" is variable.
[23:15:03] <imode> manicennui: off-planet so that when our sun explodes my kids are still alive.
[23:15:04] <edm> imode: well that‚Äôs easy
[23:15:05] <riv> you can't see them with your eyes
[23:15:09] <imode> the basic biological impetus.
[23:15:14] <edm> i presume your life has not been for nothing so far
[23:15:15] <ngoldbaum> is it more wankery than moving some infrastructure to kubernetes so a middle manager can get a promotion?
[23:15:21] <manicennui> imode: The Sun isn't going to explode for thousands of generations.
[23:15:29] <imode> manicennui: and yet that's still a finite timeline.
[23:15:29] <edm> so use your skills to develop warp drive to more driectly observe other galaxies
[23:15:46] <edm> ‚Äòsee‚Äô themn up close for whatever confused definition of ‚Äòsee‚Äô you have
[23:15:58] <manicennui> imode: Your justification is about as silly as theirs.
[23:15:58] <ngoldbaum> seems to me like a better use of money than 90% of what tech companies do
[23:16:17] <manicennui> They could easily argue that these things can lead to things that will keep us alive longer.
[23:16:29] <imode> "confuse definition". that's kind of funny. a lot of you are taking this really personally.
[23:16:35] <edm> nope
[23:16:40] <edm> answer the question
[23:16:44] <edm> you‚Äôre claiming a negative
[23:17:07] <imode> I'm claiming that space telescopes are negatives and PR moves vs. actually driving tech to get us to the stars.
[23:17:26] <imode> unless you can give me a question that JWST answers that'll get us off-planet, it's not worth it.
[23:17:42] <ngoldbaum> they‚Äôre not for PR though
[23:17:43] <manicennui> Why do you hate the Earth so much?!
[23:17:52] <ngoldbaum> they‚Äôre for answering basic science questions
[23:17:56] <imode> such as.
[23:17:57] <ngoldbaum> how do stars work
[23:18:01] <ngoldbaum> how do galaxies form
[23:18:17] <ngoldbaum> how did the first galaxies form, what were they like
[23:18:21] <imode> what's the path from those questions to "I am now off-planet and thriving".
[23:18:25] <imode> and does one exist.
[23:18:36] <ngoldbaum> i dunno if i knew that i‚Äôd be off-planet and thriving
[23:18:43] <bkero> I think imode has gone full Musk.
[23:18:49] <imode> fuck musk.
[23:18:53] <riv> we are never getting off this planet
[23:19:01] <bkero> Exactly what Musk would say
[23:19:04] <edm> it‚Äôs up to you to justify the extraordinary claim that‚Äôs it would be better to [quoting you exactly] improve ‚Äú_transportation development_‚Äù so you can [quoting you exactly] ‚Äú_see_ thesse galaxies in person rather than _image them_ from far off‚Äù
[23:19:05] <imode> with current attitudes, yeah.
[23:19:07] <manicennui> I would not change anything about my life in order to allow that to happen for people dozens of generations from now.
[23:19:10] <imode> we really aren't.
[23:19:12] <riv> we get 1 earth, don't fuck it up
[23:19:18] <imode> we've already fucked it.
[23:19:19] <manicennui> Fuck future people!
[23:19:23] <riv> there's nothing good out there, there's no grass on other planets
[23:19:39] <riv> there's no point living on a barren landscape with the wrong gravity
[23:19:48] <imode> edm: I'm bringing the "see" in there because everyone wants to see these far-off structures so badly they built a giant telscope with tons of funding to _SEE_ them.
[23:19:51] *** Quits: dmc (~dmc@archlinux/trusteduser/polyzen) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:19:53] <riv> food literally grows on trees here
[23:19:56] <imode> since _SEEING_ them seems to be the goal, I thought that'd be a motivator.
[23:20:09] <imode> I just want our species off this rock and thriving on other rocks.
[23:20:18] <imode> that's our basic biological drive.
[23:20:19] <manicennui> riv: There is zero chance that humans won't fuck the Earth up.
[23:20:19] <riv> the reason elon musk wants people in space is so he can charge them oxygen, pay to breathe
[23:20:20] <edm> _seeing_ is not the goal for scientists
[23:20:26] <riv> manicennui: yes
[23:20:29] <imode> then why the fuck did they build a telescope.
[23:20:29] <riv> unfortunately
[23:20:33] <edm> juste building better models to explain things they don‚Äôt understand yet
[23:20:33] <manicennui> riv: For humans, to be clear.
[23:20:38] <manicennui> The planet will ultimately be fine.
[23:20:40] <riv> what's more, we can't even rebuild after it collapses
[23:20:41] <imode> so, again.
[23:20:51] <imode> what questions does JWST plan to answer.
[23:20:59] *** Joins: dmc (~dmc@archlinux/trusteduser/polyzen)
[23:20:59] <imode> that will impact us in getting off-planet.
[23:21:08] <riv> i dont think the point is to get us off the planet
[23:21:09] <imode> if none, it's not worth it. if some, then it's worth it.
[23:21:21] <manicennui> imode: What if we can't know?
[23:21:21] <edm> imode: but it‚Äôs not none
[23:21:28] <edm> it‚Äôs everything
[23:21:30] <imode> okay, so what are the questions.
[23:21:37] <edm> our understanding of matter is learly wrong
[23:21:38] <riv> it says here... JWST will help with:
[23:21:50] <edm> our understanding of gravity is learly wrong
[23:21:53] <riv> early universe, dark matter, exoplanets
[23:22:03] <riv> probably other stuff too
[23:22:06] <manicennui> If your position is that we should only work on things that have known paths to other things you want, then we wouldn't have a lot of the things you have now.
[23:22:09] <edm> clearly*
[23:22:10] <manicennui> It's a silly position.
[23:22:20] <edm> it‚Äôs ludicrous
[23:22:22] <edm> ludite
[23:22:25] <edm> chameful
[23:22:25] <riv> "what is JWST going to research" is a valid question
[23:22:28] <manicennui> Especially since you seem obsessed with "technological advancement".
[23:22:30] <edm> despicable even
[23:22:31] <riv> being a ludite is good
[23:22:36] <imode> y'all have firey mouths today.
[23:22:43] <edm> no we donb‚Äôt
[23:22:46] <riv> the opposite of ludite is people digging up the earth to make thousands of disposable smartphones
[23:22:51] <imode> shut up, space fanboy.
[23:22:54] <imode> see, not fun is it.
[23:23:13] <riv> noo you can't stick up for youself!
[23:23:16] <manicennui> I'm more of an ocean fanboy.
[23:23:20] <manicennui> Fuck space.
[23:23:41] <imode> "what if we can't know" we can make reasonable conclusions, otherwise all's out the window. the capabilities of a new sensors are known, and the things that we expect them to detect are known, otherwise we wouldn't have built the sensor.
[23:23:55] <imode> we know what we're going to find, we just want to find it.
[23:24:01] <imode> we have expectations of this thing.
[23:24:11] <imode> we have expectations of the data that we're getting back from it.
[23:24:12] <edm> ‚Äòwe‚Äô is a big word here
[23:24:17] <edm> this is clearly beyond youy
[23:24:30] <imode> will _any_ of that data help in putting together the puzzle of a multi-planetary species.
[23:24:35] <manicennui> imode: We don't know what the understanding it might bring will lead to.
[23:24:51] <manicennui> Other than understanding.
[23:24:55] <imode> but we know what we'll be bringing back from the damn thing, we know what we'll be measuring.
[23:25:07] <edm> everythinf you‚Äôve said so far implies you are not the same ‚Äòwe‚Äô as scientists who understand the state of the observable art and the limitations of the current crop of theories
[23:25:09] <riv> why do you think that multiplanetary species is on the table?
[23:25:18] <riv> i dont see why that's even a goal
[23:25:40] <manicennui> riv: Humans are pretty obsessed with increasing in number and finding new places to destroy.
[23:25:44] <imode> edm: contrary, I'd say that I'm moderately okay at physics. physical law doesn't seem to elude me.
[23:25:47] <riv> the only reason i can see for it is to continue exponential growth
[23:25:56] <riv> but our exponential growth isn't a good thing
[23:26:01] <imode> edm: and I feel like I'm asking pretty appropriate questions here.
[23:26:08] <edm> i‚Äôm sure you do
[23:26:08] <riv> yes you are asking good questions imode
[23:26:12] <imode> edm: and I'm not personally insulting or attacking you.
[23:26:20] <imode> so why do you feel that it's alright to do the same to me.
[23:26:22] <edm> i‚Äôm sure elon musk thinks his tweets are reasonable too
[23:26:32] <edm> there are many confused little men on the internet
[23:26:38] <edm> it doesn‚Äôt change anything
[23:26:46] <imode> if you don't have answers then don't type on a keyboard, man.
[23:26:57] <manicennui> I'd be fully behind JWST if we think it will allow us to find space whales.
[23:27:00] <imode> it's a reasonable discussion and you're getting far too heated.
[23:27:15] <imode> if you think I'm wrong then state so with something I can chew on.
[23:27:24] <imode> calling me a luddite is not a productive use of bandwidth.
[23:27:33] <riv> luddite is a compliment
[23:27:43] <manicennui> imode: Your entire position is illogical, and you seem to believe that insults will fill in the gaps.
[23:28:21] <imode> it's illogical to say "this thing that's imaging stuff may not provide any useful information to our larger survival as a species"?
[23:28:30] <imode> call me russel 'cuz I've got a paradox, then.
[23:28:47] <imode> you'd more than likely hate sagan, too.
[23:28:50] <manicennui> A lot of the fundamental science that will allow us to do the things you want was not done in order to do the things you want.
[23:28:56] <imode> he was pretty big on the "shores of the cosmic ocean" thing.
[23:29:03] <riv> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope#Mission <-- check out the 4 key goals here
[23:29:03] <buttsbot> James Webb Space Telescope - Wikipedia
[23:29:03] <dmc> üëÄ
[23:29:16] <edm> it‚Äôs illogical to say ‚Äòthis double-slit experiment may not provide any useful information to disprove newtonian mechanics‚Äô too
[23:29:30] <edm> but that‚Äôs why we design experiments
[23:29:33] <riv> edm ok but who said that
[23:29:35] <imode> ...that was kind of the point of the experiment.
[23:29:50] <imode> and led to some fun stuff called bohmian mechanics.
[23:29:59] <imode> which you should look into some time if you're interested.
[23:30:15] <riv> isn't bohmian mechanics pretty wrong?
[23:30:16] <edm> JWST lets us observe things in the universe that have previously been unovservable and that may let us provide evidence to support one observation over another
[23:30:19] <manicennui> You seem to have a different standard for the JWST than you have for other science.
[23:30:20] <manicennui> I don't get it.
[23:30:22] <riv> btw I think edm knows physics well
[23:30:25] <riv> if i remember correctly
[23:30:43] <manicennui> riv just showed you the goals of the JWST.
[23:30:53] <imode> sure. so let's break them down.
[23:30:54] <manicennui> But somehow those goals aren't important because you don't like them or something.
[23:30:58] <riv> the thing is, you may not agree with these goals
[23:31:03] <riv> but that's what the project is aiming at
[23:31:08] <manicennui> But the LHC's goals were somehow worthy.
[23:31:21] <imode> they kind of weren't.
[23:31:28] <riv> I really like the study of exoplanets for example
[23:31:33] <edm> the problem is science is a bit like statistics or this diagram https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/
[23:31:34] <buttsbot> The illustrated guide to a Ph.D.
[23:31:41] <riv> but I think the idea that we'll find life on earth planets is ridiculously remote
[23:31:45] <riv> it's not why exoplanets are interesting
[23:31:50] <imode> exoplanet study isn't worth it unless we can go collect samples. :P
[23:31:51] <edm> you can‚Äôt say this specific nail is th right nail
[23:31:53] <manicennui> imode: Were Newton's goals of understanding physics worthy?
[23:31:55] <riv> if that's why yuo cared about it you'd be constantly disappointed
[23:32:14] <riv> Newton was a total kook
[23:32:17] <ngoldbaum> because studying other planets wouldn‚Äôt inform study of our own
[23:32:22] <ngoldbaum> no siree
[23:32:35] <edm> you can just say that this general area should attack the problem of the hypothesis not working correctly
[23:32:45] <ngoldbaum> unless you can take samples i guess?
[23:33:06] <imode> ngoldbaum: that's actually a good question, what about external observation has affected internal observation of our own planet.
[23:33:08] <edm> black hole collisions observed in IR are useful like LHC is useful, or algebra is useful
[23:33:16] <manicennui> Did Newton's physics lead to any advancements for humans during his life other than understanding?
[23:33:24] <edm> everyone must keep hammering away at the frontier in hope of a dent
[23:33:26] <imode> manicennui: trebuchets, dude. trebuchets.
[23:33:42] <riv> manicennui: yeah loads of stuff
[23:33:53] <riv> it's crazy how much newton did
[23:33:56] <imode> everything's gotta be be in the name of building better missiles.
[23:34:00] <riv> before he went mad
[23:34:09] <ngoldbaum> manicennui: better clocks and optics, for one
[23:34:10] <manicennui> Trebuchets predate Newton by quite a bit.
[23:34:17] <imode> so do flint tools.
[23:34:29] <imode> not sure of the point, we can build better tools.
[23:34:42] <imode> actually that's a much better way to frame my position.
[23:34:54] <imode> will this imaging work help us build better tools.
[23:35:00] <imode> directly or indirectly.
[23:35:07] <imode> if yes, it's worth it. if not, it's not.
[23:35:12] <riv> well  yes
[23:35:12] <edm> FALSE
[23:35:26] <riv> they literally made the best telescope ever
[23:35:27] <edm> at least in the way you‚Äôre asking the question
[23:35:45] <imode> riv: so, you're seeing this as a proving ground for new sensor tech?
[23:36:02] <edm> because that question has been false for almost any fundamental physics experiment within about the first 2 decades since the observation was made
[23:36:05] <riv> well the james webb telescope is a better telescope than has ever been built before
[23:36:15] <riv> just to answer your question about "will this lead to better tools"
[23:36:17] <riv> it is a better tool
[23:36:35] <imode> you're correct, maybe I should reign in some of that.
[23:36:35] <riv> I think the sensors we have on earth are fine already
[23:36:50] <riv> the thing I like about this telescope is it will get us good pictures
[23:37:05] <riv> like if it was all secret and they never shared the images, i wouldn't care about it
[23:37:07] <imode> actually that brings another question: is it better because we're applying already existing sensor tech, but in an unobstructed space.
[23:37:16] <imode> or are the sensors _actually better_.
[23:37:43] <edm> if you want to go back further, most question of natural philosophy [what they called maths and physics] ahve been useless for maybe 500+years after it was discovered?
[23:38:16] <imode> not sure what your point is.
[23:38:21] <ngoldbaum> imode: it has approximately the same level of technology in the detectors as the newest hubble instruments
[23:38:30] <imode> ngoldbaum: ..then why s it better.
[23:38:39] <ngoldbaum> bigger telescope
[23:38:41] <imode> ah.
[23:38:45] <ngoldbaum> also goes out to the far IR
[23:38:49] <edm> perhaps the Haggia Sophia, being the largest spanning structure for 1500 years, was a good example several centuries after the greeks provided the persians with tools to design it
[23:38:50] <imode> then I don't think it's worth it, then.
[23:38:55] <ngoldbaum> hubble can‚Äôt do that, the earth is too bright
[23:38:56] <ngoldbaum> lol
[23:39:00] <ngoldbaum> only for the sensors
[23:39:02] <imode> oh, that's different.
[23:39:07] <ngoldbaum> the sensors are the least interesting part
[23:39:15] <imode> cool, remove them then.
[23:39:18] <edm> it‚Äôs not different
[23:39:30] <edm> you just lack the perspective to understand what everyone is telling you
[23:39:44] <imode> I've already accepted you can't discuss this, edm.
[23:39:47] <riv> I think imode just cares about different things
[23:39:50] <imode> maybe you should try accepting that.
[23:39:57] <edm> just /leave here and follow Elon [first name terms] on twitter and have a happy life
[23:40:01] <riv> I dont know why that would be a problem
[23:40:52] <imode> ngoldbaum: hubble and JWST are interesting to me if we're testing sensors in new environments. the reason I ask that is that it's a proving ground for a tool we've built in order to explore the means to make better tools or address flaws in existing ones.
[23:41:22] <edm> do you not see though that that‚Äôs just a question of your usefulness horizon
[23:41:23] <imode> theories help build tools too, but indirectly. but there's not a lot in the mission statement that seems to directly impact theories that'll help us build, say, a warp drive or something.
[23:41:29] <ngoldbaum> i think that‚Äôs a really sad way of looking at it
[23:41:40] <edm> if yout just want result you can apply as engineers in the next 2 decaades that‚Äôs one thing
[23:41:51] <imode> edm: no, I'd like to just get us off-planet.
[23:41:53] <edm> and fundamental physics is another
[23:41:56] <imode> tool development is a prereq.
[23:41:58] <riv> why?
[23:42:03] <imode> survival as a species, man.
[23:42:03] <riv> what's good that's off this planet
[23:42:05] <edm> but which plent do you want to get us to and why
[23:42:06] <manicennui> It's kind of silly to conclude that the public mission statement contains absolutely everything that anyone hopes to get out of the project.
[23:42:16] <riv> unfortunately I think that the previous generations fucked it already
[23:42:19] <manicennui> It's for the public.
[23:42:36] <riv> desperately trying to jump ship onto a barren planet isn't going to help
[23:42:47] <imode> riv: if we can learn how to terraform, we can learn how to build new habitats, including refurbishing this one.
[23:43:01] <imode> riv: that doesn't happen without tool development.
[23:43:16] <edm> jesus fucking christ
[23:43:21] <manicennui> You'd probably have to read the work of the scientists involved and listen to countless conversations to even know what they are all hoping for.
[23:43:22] <imode> and this planet won't be here in a couple thousand generations.
[23:43:25] <edm> if we could just reverse climate change
[23:43:28] <riv> I just don't have any hope or belief in that. We can poison a planet, we can't turn it from barren into something that's full of green and life
[23:43:29] <edm> if we could just cure aids
[23:43:37] <riv> entropy only goes one direction
[23:43:57] <imode> I see you didn't fund TeamTrees. :P
[23:43:58] <edm> if we could jest make everyone logical
[23:44:20] <edm> if we could just move humans to the 70% of the planetg that‚Äôs underwater
[23:44:30] <riv> lol
[23:44:32] <riv> underwater humans
[23:44:35] <riv> i like it
[23:44:38] <imode> atlantis the sequel.
[23:44:41] <edm> wildly easier than moving to mars
[23:44:54] <imode> we'll have to move off-planet eventually.
[23:44:55] <manicennui> The thing that most people don't want to admit is that there is no system or solution that works well for this many humans.
[23:44:57] <imode> not to mars, fuck mars.
[23:45:01] <imode> mars is a desolate barren wasteland.
[23:45:05] <edm> i just don‚Äôt know what do do with this chat anymore after the 784656th time. why do i waste me time
[23:45:07] <riv> how about venus then?
[23:45:09] <imode> that'll be swallowed by the sun.
[23:45:16] <edm> point on the doll to where Elon touched you
[23:45:20] <imode> pretty much anything in our solar system is out.
[23:45:49] <manicennui> Humans need more natural predators that affect them when they try to expand too much.
[23:45:58] <imode> we do, it's called the vacuum of space.
[23:46:00] <riv> this. bring back drop bears
[23:46:01] <imode> or near-vacuum.
[23:46:13] <manicennui> imode: We are a long way from that being a concern.
[23:46:20] <manicennui> And we'll destroy ourselves long before.
[23:46:30] <imode> I dunno, vacuums are the enemy.
[23:46:37] <imode> explosive decompression, for one.
[23:46:41] <manicennui> That's just what your dog thinks.
[23:46:46] <imode> and divers.
[23:46:54] <riv> also the xenomorphs from alien
[23:46:54] <imode> and those three dudes who got turned into meat glue.
[23:47:42] <manicennui> Did the queen actually die after it was sucked out of the ship?
[23:47:47] <manicennui> Or is it just out there floating in space?
[23:47:54] <imode> dunno, let's use JWST to find out.
[23:47:58] <riv> lol
[23:49:00] <imode> that's the real mission.
[23:49:08] <imode> finding alien. the one alient.
[23:49:10] <imode> *alien.
[23:50:27] <imode> imo my societal progression would be terraforming -> space travel -> space colonies. but since we only know how to terraform in one direction, the rest of it isn't happening.
[23:50:40] <imode> so we're just gonna die on this rock.
[23:50:56] <imode> hope those false color photos left all of you inspired.
[23:55:18] <manicennui> We?
[23:55:22] <manicennui> I won't be alive.
[23:55:27] <manicennui> I don't care what the rest of you do.
[23:55:35] <imode> hop into a suicide pod, then.
[23:55:40] <manicennui> I figure there will be major water problems in a couple decades.
[23:55:53] <manicennui> But I'm picking my future area of residence based on that.
[23:56:02] <manicennui> I'd probably be fine here in Chicago
[23:56:09] <manicennui> I didn't say anything about wanting to die.
[23:56:15] <manicennui> You jump to some really illogical conclusions.
[23:56:34] <imode> it was a joke, but fuck you too. ;)
[23:57:09] <riv> what about making a dyson ring
[23:57:17] <riv> that could be neat
[23:57:30] <edm> it‚Äôs as ludicrous a suggestion as imodes
[23:57:35] <edm> fantasy
[23:57:35] <riv> find a way to turn solar power into water and soil and seeds
[23:57:48] <edm> excessively online denialists
[23:57:56] <imode> what the fuck is your problem, edm.
[23:58:10] <imode> what kind of denialist am I.
[23:58:14] <riv> yes it is fantasy.. its a sci fi book that I like called ringworld :P
[23:58:38] <imode> did you just wake up on the wrong side of the bed.
[23:59:27] <riv> he's anngry because you have a different set of values than h im
[23:59:41] <riv> this makes no sense to me but it seems to be thing w/ humans
