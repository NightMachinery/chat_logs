[00:20:50] <Activ8> we took over about 30% of our customers they moved to us from their previous provider due to uptime
[00:20:55] <Activ8> so we had to promise better uptime

[00:22:44] <sd> 02<B​hop> Our uptime on exchange was much better than Exchange Online tho
[00:23:03] <Activ8> they need to integrate updates without needing to reboot
[00:23:06] <Activ8> especially servers
[00:23:17] <Activ8> even better workstations if they could just impliment this
[00:23:38] <Activ8> even if it's a soft core reboot where it just reinitializes login or something 
[00:24:04] <sd> 02<B​hop> If you need 100% uptime, you pay for redundancy, or deal with some downtime. Seems simple to me
[00:24:13] <sd> 11<S​eth> I believe that would be dependent on whether it's a user-related update. If it's system, it's tricky and could very much require a reboot to safely restart the services associated with the update.

[00:24:28] <sd> 02<B​hop> Or at least weekly
[00:24:43] <sintax> depending on what you're using you could
[00:24:58] <sd> 02<B​hop> Its not a technical limitation
[00:25:00] <sintax> just don't screw up the time like i did once and shut everyone down at 3pm on a workday...
[00:25:26] <sintax> supposed to happen at 3am...oppsies
[00:25:26] <sd> 11<S​eth> Not sure if Group Policy supports some kind of mandatory restart interval, but should be doable with scripts - good luck on that though making it stable haha
[00:25:28] <Activ8> you probably could force reboot
[00:25:36] <Activ8> you could schedule task a reboot at 12PM
[00:25:53] <sd> 11<S​eth> ^
[00:25:54] <sd> 02<B​hop> Yeah, technically its a non issue
[00:25:54] <Activ8> and tell the users they MUST save the work before end of play
[00:26:11] <sd> 11<S​eth> If they don't save, they can't blame anybody but themselves
[00:26:13] <Activ8> if they don't they will lose work.  Enforce a policy that users MUST do this
[00:26:22] <sintax> you can even powershell messages that they're gonna reboot and need to save their work. 
[00:26:49] <Activ8> workplace dependant - you could easy do this it's simple
[00:27:08] <vinrock> anything left open and unsaved on a machine here after hours is that persons problem
[00:27:13] <sd> 02<B​hop> Oh I know, i created a powershell script to literally yell at the user, and have popups. using PDQ deploy to target computers with a certain amount of uptime
[00:27:13] <Activ8> indeed
[00:27:31] <Activ8> our users know to save
[00:27:39] <sd> 11<S​eth> What would be a good restart interval?
[00:27:44] <Activ8> some companies we look after does a shutdown at 6pm by policy
[00:27:53] <vinrock> i have all machines reboot every sunday
[00:27:58] <sd> 02<B​hop> I think a reboot a week should be fine
[00:28:30] <Activ8> the problem is we have remote workers so some machines are excluded.  Some access via a vm so we don't reboot those just workstations onsite
[00:28:44] <Activ8> one reboot every sunday would be a good start
[00:28:55] <Activ8> IF they don't remote in on a sunday via vpn or something
[00:29:24] <Activ8> we have 1 company where it downloads updates on a saturday and reboots on a sunday

[00:30:10] <Activ8> with us been a msp we have such a difference in all the companies so we have a mix n match scenario and it's all up to the company
[00:30:34] <vinrock> you can always use schtasks to create a one time reboot task on the vpn users' machine when they are logged into the vpn
[00:30:55] <vinrock> do your maintenance, set the reboot task and notify the user

[06:17:44] <jay-ros> how do you apply
[06:17:47] <jay-ros> is there a trick to it?
[06:17:54] <Jaelae> you get hired fulltime and have a 1 year role. you always get the opportunity to stay permanent unless you are awful. but for 6 months you do one job with one team and the next 6 months another job with another team. automation, cloud architecture, cyber security, data analytics, AI/ML. you pick what you are interested in
[06:18:07] <Jaelae> have to get your bachelors degree for the 2022 year
[06:18:18] <Jaelae> "A Bachelor’s or Master’s degree attained between August 2021 – June 2022 is required"
[06:19:15] <jay-ros> so any john can get in as long as they have a degree?
[06:20:02] <Jaelae> yes but in that timeframe so new college graduate
[06:20:04] <Jaelae> they do it every year
[06:20:46] <Jaelae> last group i knew from last year ended up starting on the cloud team and just did Google Cloud, AWS  and Azure training for months then were put on projects. seemed like a much better alternative than jumping into help desk day zero

[09:09:11] <SirSceptalot> good morning
[09:09:55] <sideup66> im kinda stuck on mine with something, im planning to tap into the existing lighting on my prelit tree, the feeding power in on the power input is 29v dc at .2 of an amp....found these for controlling the lights and i could see the pi potentially using 1.5 of them: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PFC4RRB , im curious if anyone knows in that type of setup with power in, how id wire both boards
[09:09:57] <sideup66> up to power the lights? the pi itself has 2 5v rails on its gpio pins, so no problem there to power and control circuits
[09:10:28] <sideup66> im just confused how power would wire up (not to menton i need to find a sacrificial cable i can cut up potentially)
[09:11:10] <CableNinja> sideup66, the 3 wires are +/- and signal
[09:11:14] <CableNinja> the 2 wires are outputs
[09:11:34] <CableNinja> signal is your pwm line that you control via the pi
[09:14:04] <sideup66> oh? so the pi wouldnt attach via pin there? where would i send power for whatever is attached to the board?

[12:02:59] <lancehead> !flyfact
[12:02:59] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies defecate… a lot! And they aren’t too worried about where they do it either! As you know, house flies like to live off a liquid diet. Because of this, their digestive system can move quite quickly, which means they defecate often. It is speculated that house flies defecate every time they land, even if it’s on their next meal!
[12:03:06] <lancehead> There we go
[12:03:11] <lancehead> Hi Activ8
[12:03:19] <SirSceptalot> well at least it's when they land
[12:03:47] <lancehead> So what you're saying is if there's a really annoying fly while I'm eating, I get shat on like 30 times? 
[12:03:47] <Activ8> Hello lancehead
[12:04:32] <A-KO> ugh
[12:04:37] <A-KO> okay all of the main shit I care about is reset
[12:04:49] <lancehead> woooooo
[12:05:01] <A-KO> Apple's got the transactions marked as fraud
[12:05:03] <A-KO> we gucci
[12:06:12] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> I feel Luke I gotta throw up
[12:06:16] <Activ8> How on earth is it possible for hackers to steal info on Apple cards
[12:06:27] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Hmmmmmmmmm?mm
[12:06:41] <Activ8> banks should be secure by now it’s fucking 2021
[12:07:04] <A-KO> so the physical card has a chip and a mag stripe. Then there's the "Apple Pay" card ; which is a different number. And then there's the Apple card # I can use on websites that don't take Apple Pay. So technically, every Apple Card setup is 3 different numbers.
[12:07:07] <A-KO> They stole 1 of the 3
[12:07:17] <Activ8> Apple got rid of the numbers right? Wasn’t that their plan?
[12:07:30] <A-KO> With Apple Pay? Sure. But the rest of the world doesn't operate like that :(
[12:07:36] <Activ8> shit
[12:07:43] <A-KO> if I use Apple Pay then it's no big deal, they aren't stealing shit
[12:08:01] <A-KO> but the physical card is a different story--that's just a standard card
[12:08:16] <Activ8> Once Apple Card hits the uk I won’t ever use my real card
[12:08:23] <A-KO> The trick is the fact that if the physical card gets jacked, you just request a new one and continue to use Apple Pay and the long-form card # you use for websites.
[12:08:37] <Activ8> i use virtual cards now and never buy anything off my phone
[12:08:40] <A-KO> If the long form card # you use on the web gets jacked, you just immediately request a new number
[12:08:45] <Activ8> always use Apple Pay where possible
[12:09:11] <A-KO> The physical card itself has nothing printed on it except your name, and some shit about Mastercard and the bank and whatnot
[12:09:12] <A-KO> that's it
[12:09:14] <A-KO> no card #s
[12:09:17] <Activ8> i never buy anything with real card is what I meant to say
[12:09:26] <Activ8> i always use Apple pay
[12:09:35] <A-KO> the card # you put onto websites, i.e. #### #### #### #### ; is a card number you have to open the wallet app to get.
[12:09:42] <Activ8> yeh
[12:09:46] <A-KO> You can reset that number at any time, although I haven't tested how many times I can rotate it in a day lol
[12:10:08] <A-KO> With iOS 15 they added additional security on that number, and the CVV code rotates now too
[12:10:39] <A-KO> I"m not sure how the rotating CVV number still allows stored cards on say, amazon, to work
[12:10:50] <Activ8> We need to bring theft = hand/fingers chopped off era
[12:11:04] <A-KO> and Apple Pay is a different beast entirely. They're not going to swipe that. So if you can use Apple Pay at counters, restaurants, bars, or websites--do it
[12:11:06] <Activ8> Proven 100% guilty murder = hanging
[12:11:16] <Activ8> that should reduce it
[12:11:24] <A-KO> Apple Pay is by far the most secure method to purchase something
[12:11:51] <Activ8> it might become mainstream as time goes on
[12:12:03] <Activ8> We have it everywhere now
[12:12:08] <A-KO> you actually can't "rotate" the Apple Pay #. So I'm assuming that there's something odd going on with whatever merchants see with it.
[12:12:18] <Activ8> every card machine is activated with Apple pay
[12:12:20] <A-KO> which I assume means it's basically bullet proof
[12:12:28] <A-KO> it's at many places here now
[12:12:31] <A-KO> particularly after Covid
[12:13:23] <A-KO> There's one gas station out of the 4 within an immediate distance from me that doesn't take Apple Pay--and only on the inside card swipe machine. Which is odd. Their pumps take apple pay just fine.
[12:13:54] <Activ8> Sounds like they might be scamming
[12:13:57] <A-KO> Everywhere else here uses apple pay, except restaurants--because American dining payment is fucking stupid.
[12:14:11] <A-KO> where we physically hand over our cards
[12:14:15] <A-KO> and they walk away with it
[12:14:18] <Activ8> fraud in the UK is a disaster

[12:14:50] <A-KO> I mean. I just added $200 to the fraud on Mastercard/Apple Pay.
[12:14:55] <Activ8> they have full control
[12:15:06] <A-KO> So fun fact.
[12:15:09] <Activ8> they are paying people to have access to your bank
[12:15:16] <A-KO> I only used the physical card at 3 places over the past 14 days
[12:15:25] <A-KO> which means it LIKELY got swiped at the valet parking for the restaurant I ate at
[12:15:39] <A-KO> I went to Dave & Buster's, a restaurant named Mozambique, and then used their valet--which took card.
[12:15:44] <A-KO> 99% I'm thinking it was the valet
[12:16:02] <Activ8> and all that happens is the bank gets a flag, gets shut down and the person that opened the bank account becomes “fraud” activated and they can never get a bank account or credit again
[12:16:38] <Activ8> What you could do is ask “do they take Apple Pay” if they don’t just don’t eat there
[12:16:51] <A-KO> most restaurants in the US don't take apple pay
[12:16:55] <A-KO> because of the way we pay our bills here
[12:17:01] <Activ8> Wow really
[12:17:05] <A-KO> it's completely ass backwards compared to everywhere else

[12:46:26] <rpifan> sysadmin.com
[12:46:46] <Activ8> subdomain.tld.com or subdomain.domain.com or subdomain.internal doesn't really matter
[12:46:58] <Activ8> we know what you mean
[12:46:58] <rpifan> yea i know idk why we are going down this path lol
[12:47:04] <rpifan> i want lunch already
[12:47:09] <Activ8> I just had breakfast
[12:47:22] <rpifan> i really look horrible in zoom meetings
[12:47:31] <rpifan> i look 80 years old
[12:47:39] <rpifan> and like im not spending massive amounts of money on my face
[12:47:43] <rpifan> must be the office lighting
[12:47:44] <Activ8> I'm glad we don't have cam meetings there's no need we just get on with our job
[12:48:02] <rpifan> so Activ8 how do you stay busy at work
[12:48:05] <rpifan> besides talking shit on irc
[12:48:18] <Activ8> not so sure you call it talking shit lol
[12:48:35] <Activ8> most of it is valid points 
[12:48:56] <Activ8> I watch tv, put my feet up, check tickets, monitor servers/desktops via a console for errors
[12:49:02] <rpifan> lol
[12:49:08] <Activ8> drink tea/coffee, eat, shower
[12:49:08] <rpifan> clearly you have a job where stuff is already working
[12:49:25] <rpifan> and are staying at home, i will soon be let loose home office wise i think for most days
[12:49:29] <Activ8> 85% of it just works.  The other 15% is where the support comes into play
[12:49:32] <rpifan> with only one in person day a week it seems
[12:49:47] <Activ8> i.e account creation, onboarding, the odd desktop support question
[12:50:03] <rpifan> thats the biggest reason i wanna keep this job for a while, one day a week in the office is a decent deal in germany
[12:50:17] <Activ8> I might have a reddit day sit on that bad boy trolling
[12:50:34] <Activ8> I'm wfh 100% of the time
[12:50:38] <Activ8> all remote working
[12:51:37] <Activ8> I do private jobs as well, usually websites and domain administration 
[12:51:42] <Activ8> so I make a little bit cash on the side
[12:52:05] <Joe-Developer> damage to a PC in one of the IT suites and it's just a game of pass the blame
[12:52:07] <Joe-Developer> ffs
[12:52:38] <Activ8> student damage or staff damage? you won't ever find out who did it without cameras up
[12:52:41] <rpifan> whats an IT suite
[12:52:43] <rpifan> sounds nice
[12:52:45] <rpifan> does it come with a stripper
[12:52:51] <Activ8> it's a room full of computers
[12:53:02] <SirSceptalot> we need to start a company, rpifan can do purchasing
[12:53:03] <Activ8> i.e 10 macs or 25 pcs 
[12:53:14] <SirSceptalot> ew, macs, i'm out
[12:53:18] <rpifan> i will purchase blackjack and hookers
[12:53:23] <Joe-Developer> believed to be student damage 
[12:53:32] <rpifan> for the talk of hookers and strippers ive never really done any of that
[12:53:51] <Joe-Developer> issue is that the last person that was logged on was also the person that reported it broken apparently "before they logged on"
[12:53:57] <Activ8> I worked in a student place, 44,000 students when there was damage we stopped replacing the systems for a week and we put a note on saying it was out of order
[12:54:07] <Activ8> once they realised damaging machines meant no computer time they soon stopped
[12:54:12] <Joe-Developer> yeup
[12:54:27] <rpifan> what kind of damage
[12:54:28] <Activ8> trust me it works as well, play reverse phycology on the fuckers
[12:54:31] <rpifan> i dont expect someone took a bat to it
[12:54:32] <Joe-Developer> I said to my boss "CCTV" he agrees but then teachers union gets involved etc it's shite
[12:54:39] <Activ8> we used to get them ramming shit in the usb ports 
[12:54:41] <Joe-Developer> looks like someones taken a pen or a compass to the monitor
[12:54:48] <Joe-Developer> about a 3 inch deep scratch across it
[12:54:59] <Joe-Developer> but we have damage to things all the time
[12:55:05] <Joe-Developer> had a mouse with no buttons yesterday
[12:55:05] <Activ8> nah no cctv in education unless it's a main corridor students will get intimidated 
[12:55:10] <Joe-Developer> keyboard missing half it's keys the other day
[12:55:16] <Activ8> I feel your pain
[12:55:25] <SirSceptalot> Activ8, that's exactly how they're supposed to be
[12:55:35] <Joe-Developer> Activ8, you say that, but we're a private school so we don't have much cctv but most state schools have them in every corridor and every classroom
[12:56:10] <Activ8> there's a limit to how much you make them feel intimidated.  The place I was at if they ever put cctv in classrooms the students would leave straight away
[12:56:20] <Activ8> without students there's no class
[12:56:21] <Joe-Developer> most students believe any strange shaped object on the wall or ceiling is a "hidden camera" anyway
[12:56:30] <rpifan> well its most likely true
[12:56:35] <Activ8> is this the US Joe-Developer? lol
[12:56:38] <Joe-Developer> UK
[12:56:43] <rpifan> oh really well the uk sucks
[12:56:45] <Activ8> that's a bit strange I never got that
[12:56:47] <Joe-Developer> yea
[12:56:48] <rpifan> they have gotten legit big brother over there
[12:56:59] <rpifan> london is under constant total survelience
[12:57:06] <rpifan> at least the germans really push back against most of that shit
[12:57:06] <Activ8> it has to be rpifan 
[12:57:20] <rpifan> berlin is probably one of the least surveiled cities
[12:57:23] <Activ8> London is the place where most stuff goes down
[12:57:23] <rpifan> after the wall came down
[12:57:26] <Joe-Developer> yeah my argument is that the IT suites are some of the most "expensive" classrooms in the school so if there was a break-in we would know nothing about what they do inside
[12:57:45] <SirSceptalot> Joe-Developer, what strange shaped object would that be? An analogue clock?
[12:57:56] <Joe-Developer> London surveillance is something else
[12:58:28] <Joe-Developer> SirSceptalot, anything from smoke detectors to door sensors
[12:58:34] <Joe-Developer> it's stupid what people think is a camera
[12:58:48] *** Quits: bloody (~bloody@user/bloody) (Quit: Always focus on how far you've come, rather than how far you have left to go)
[12:58:55] <Joe-Developer> like no, all our cameras are easy to see on purpose
[12:59:01] <Joe-Developer> we're not trying to hide them
[12:59:38] <rpifan> Joe-Developer, thats what i was told
[12:59:45] <Oliber> don't want to hide cameras, but also don't want them to be all up in your face, we have quite a lot of little axis cieling mounted dome cameras
[12:59:46] <rpifan> eventually i learnt that they want you to see the cameras
[13:00:02] <rpifan> they want you to feel intimidated by them
[13:00:20] <Joe-Developer> nah we have cameras covering every entrance and exit, one or two main corridors and in common rooms
[13:00:32] <rpifan> who needs a computer when you got a smartphone anyway
[13:00:48] <Joe-Developer> most students like the cameras because it means if a kid steals someone elses stuff it's on camera
[13:00:48] <Activ8> a place I worked at had cctv in main offices so they could see what was on peoples screens remotely
[13:01:02] <Activ8> they banned all personal sites and ended up allowing a list of sites accessable
[13:01:21] <Oliber> friday: student vaping in common room, please provide footage to identify who it was, monday: student pulled cctv camera off the wall, shortly after on monday: student took another student's bag
[13:01:22] <Joe-Developer> fuck that Activ8 
[13:01:35] <Joe-Developer> Oliber, legit lol
[13:01:46] <Joe-Developer> I think last week ours was
[13:02:00] <Oliber> best part? if they did take something off the wall, it wasn't the current camera
[13:02:09] <Joe-Developer> student stuck sticker over camera and student chucking water out the window
[13:02:09] <rpifan> vaping in the common room
[13:02:10] <rpifan> lol
[13:02:25] <Oliber> got great pictures of their face next to the camera though
[13:02:35] <Joe-Developer> some kids are dumb
[13:02:41] <Joe-Developer> if you're gonna put a sticker over a camera
[13:03:02] <Joe-Developer> don't do it in view of another camera and don't walk upto it staring at the camera when I saw you take that sticker off that apple
[13:03:03] <Oliber> make sure you aren't in coverage when you put it on?
[13:03:07] <Activ8> I think technology is to blame for a lot of problems but also fixes some
[13:03:23] <teh_f4ll3n> morning
[13:03:48] <SirSceptalot> morning
[13:03:51] <Activ8> morning 
[13:03:52] <rpifan> dont yall feel bad being narcs
[13:04:31] <Oliber> do you like your bag being stolen? or people stinking up places?
[13:04:31] <teh_f4ll3n> oh god, rpifan is back
[13:05:16] <Joe-Developer> shit like throwing water out a window I think "Really?" like to the staff
[13:05:20] <Joe-Developer> just carry on who cares
[13:05:35] <Joe-Developer> stolen items and things a bit worse it's useful for
[13:05:42] <Activ8> students like to piss about
[13:05:43] <Oliber> depends if they are aiming at people
[13:05:47] <Activ8> that's part of growing up
[13:05:53] <Joe-Developer> but it's also helpful
[13:06:13] <Oliber> getting caught is part of growing up, yep
[13:06:25] <Activ8> not getting caught is the fun part lol
[13:07:23] <Joe-Developer> nah but for example
[13:07:32] <Joe-Developer> brb
[13:07:33] <Oliber> you don't learn as much if you don't get caught
[13:08:22] <Oliber> adapt, improvise, improve
[13:12:02] <Activ8> getting caught just means your bad at keeping quiet lol
[13:12:37] <sd> 05<J​oe-Developer> We once had a kid who said a teacher put his hands on him and threw him up against the wall when he was getting told off. We checked cctv and it saved the teachers job
[13:12:37] <Oliber> or you failed the perception check
[13:12:45] <Activ8> I'm on doing some active directory clean-up atm some accounts need archiving
[13:13:11] <Activ8> that's a very good point Joe-Developer, teacher safety
[13:15:19] <Oliber> Activ8: we had 8-10 builders sitting right under where we had 3 very obvious cameras smoking weed, drinking and leaving a mess, the site manager wasn't particularly happy his demolition crew were coming back half-cut from their lunch break

[13:25:14] <csws> yeah you can have cnames pointing to cnames
[13:25:40] <Activ8> I host my website on github (it's just a landing page)
[13:26:01] <Activ8> well one of my sites on github I was using it as a test
[13:26:12] <csws> if it's in the same zone then the resolver will probably flatten it anyway
[13:27:04] <Activ8> make a cname for test.example.com and point it to chicken.com (not an A record subdomain).
[13:28:28] <SirSceptalot> chicken.com is not nearly as interesting as I would have hoped
[13:29:51] <Activ8> that's pretty boring
[13:30:38] <Activ8> think of a cname like an A record but instead of pointing it to an IP address it points to a URL instead.

[13:44:29] <rpifan> boring but ok
[13:45:04] <rpifan> so also i am to create the IT department within the HR Departmetn
[13:46:25] <SirSceptalot> Hunterkll, I guess you're technically correct, which is the best kind of correct
[13:46:50] <SirSceptalot> rpifan, not doing any actual work and just being nice to people sounds like exactly the kind of job I would hate
[13:47:03] <rpifan> yeaaaa
[13:47:12] <rpifan> i mean i dont mind doing that for a part of the day
[13:47:16] <rpifan> but for the first two weeks

[13:47:31] <BWMerlin> What is the end goal?
[13:47:46] <SirSceptalot> I don't really get it though. Do they just what you to get to know the company and not do any damage trying to change things first?
[13:47:52] <BWMerlin> Are you being nice to people while the paper work is going through to sack them?
[13:47:52] <SirSceptalot> or, what BWMerlin said
[13:48:02] <SirSceptalot> LOL
[13:48:20] <SirSceptalot> "lets hire some douche, and make him fire other douches"

[14:08:59] <lancehead> Yeah true 
[14:10:16] <teh_f4ll3n> hmmm... interesting
[14:10:41] <teh_f4ll3n> 12900K is supposed to be an unlocked chip for OCing, right?
[14:10:43] <lancehead> InteresTINGLE IN MY BALL-- okay I'll stop 
[14:10:51] <lancehead> Think so yeah 
[14:10:58] <teh_f4ll3n> well, it's pointless to OC it
[14:11:06] <lancehead> How so?
[14:11:17] <Activ8> sorry was busy on a call
[14:11:44] <teh_f4ll3n> generates too much heat when you OC it
[14:12:00] <lancehead> Better cooling? 
[14:12:20] <Hunterkll> heh
[14:12:24] <lancehead> To be fair if I was going to overclock a 12900K it'd probably be water cooled in the first place 
[14:12:28] <Hunterkll> not necessarily pointless, but all depends on what you're do ing
[14:12:34] <Hunterkll> but K skus sometimes also have more features/differences as well 
[14:13:04] <Hunterkll> and supposedly ar ehigher binned anyway, which means better turbo performance, etc
[14:13:09] <Hunterkll> even without OC-ing
[14:13:15] <teh_f4ll3n> even a full 360 AIO can't cool it fast enough
[14:13:25] <teh_f4ll3n> it appears
[14:13:27] <Hunterkll> well if you're using an AIO you deserve what you get
[14:13:29] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:13:44] <lancehead> Custom loop that shit 
[14:13:49] <Hunterkll> lord knows my CPU can go off the rails when OC'd
[14:13:57] <lancehead> Use ice water 
[14:13:58] <lancehead> UBER COOL 
[14:13:58] <Hunterkll> i think the record someone got was over 1KW power draw over the EPS cables 
[14:14:18] <Hunterkll> no clue what mine's stiting at usage wise, but my PC draws about 6-7 amps idle from the UPS
[14:14:26] <Hunterkll> it's OC'd a decent bit 
[14:14:36] <lancehead> Think it'd be possible to just put ice water in the reservoir?...
[14:15:03] <Hunterkll> IIRC too K cpus have a higher base clock stock then non-K sometimes

[14:17:56] <Hunterkll> heh, 12900K's TDP is like 40-100W lower than mine
[14:17:57] <Hunterkll> nice
[14:19:35] <Activ8> I didn't know Apple purchased MDM vendor Fleetsmith.  This is what kicked off the MDM Apple Business Essentials.
[14:19:39] <Hunterkll> hum.....
[14:20:01] <Hunterkll> teh_f4ll3n: Well, there's no non-K varaint of the 12900 at all so i guess it's totally irrelevant 
[14:20:18] <Hunterkll> there's a KF varaint without the integrated GPU which is probably better for OCing regardless, but that's it
[14:20:22] <xe0n> BWMerlin: yeah i use ss at work
[14:20:33] <teh_f4ll3n> I suppose
[14:21:00] <BWMerlin> Is it any good?  I really like the idea of not sharing passwords but sharing password access as well as having it auto cycle passwords
[14:21:05] <teh_f4ll3n> it's just the 4790K was a great overclocker even on air
[14:21:34] <teh_f4ll3n> and I haven't owned an intel CPU since
[14:22:07] <Hunterkll> I mean, I get decent overclocking on air too using a hyper 212 cooler 
[14:22:09] <xe0n> yes good
[14:22:16] <Hunterkll> though using a $30 air cooler on a $2000 CPU is kind of silly 
[14:22:27] <xe0n> bitwarden does sharing password access
[14:22:30] <Hunterkll> but i'm sitting at 165W rated TDP stock on a 180W rated air cooler at that point 
[14:22:39] <teh_f4ll3n> not even considering air at this point
[14:22:49] <lancehead> I have returned 
[14:22:50] <SirSceptalot> Hunterkll, as long as it works I wouldn't know why it would be silly
[14:22:54] <Hunterkll> I was air for quite a while before I finally refit and reinstalled all my parts 
[14:23:09] <teh_f4ll3n> I'm still on air
[14:23:09] <Activ8> does anyone know of any free kit for MSPS? I'm trying to bag some free stuff to play with
[14:23:10] <teh_f4ll3n> :D
[14:23:11] <Hunterkll> SirSceptalot: half the point of buying this CPU is stuff that will far exceed the capabilities of any air cooler that exists :P
[14:23:12] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:23:26] <teh_f4ll3n> my next is going to be AIO
[14:23:38] <teh_f4ll3n> I can't be bothered with building a custom loop
[14:23:39] <lancehead> Same ^ 
[14:23:43] <Hunterkll> eh, i wouldn't bother unless you're doing a full 360 for just the CPU 
[14:23:53] <lancehead> That is the plan 
[14:23:56] <lancehead> ;)
[14:23:58] <Hunterkll> a 2 fan radiator and you8 can get better performance with a cheaper air cooler
[14:24:22] <Hunterkll> and the AIO flow rate .... with how tiny those pipes are....
[14:24:37] <Hunterkll> they excel in making quiet systems, but not necessarily in performance 
[14:24:49] <teh_f4ll3n> My R7 1700X is just fine with the 212
[14:24:55] <lancehead> I really wanna move up to an R5 3600x and a 2060 at some point. Currently have an R5 1600 and a 1660 6gb overclocked 
[14:25:14] <teh_f4ll3n> I'm on 2060 Super
[14:25:23] <Hunterkll> meanwhile i'm running both GPUs and CPU on a single 360 radiator just fine currently (560 is out of the loop at the moment) and blowing away what a 360 AIO could do on *just* the CPU 
[14:25:28] <lancehead> How is it? 
[14:26:34] <lancehead> I do see a lot of people saying a 2060 isn't that big of a performance upgrade over a 1660 but I almost can't imagine that's true lol 
[14:26:54] <Hunterkll> 16xx GPUs were meant to be 20xx equivelents without RTX functionality 
[14:27:12] <lancehead> Hmm, might have to move up to a 3060 then... 
[14:27:17] <Hunterkll> if you're not doing RTX games, then there's not really much to write home about 
[14:27:28] <teh_f4ll3n> yup 1660 and 2060 are quite comparable
[14:27:30] <Hunterkll> we're talking a ~10% difference between the two 
[14:27:50] <lancehead> I did also consider going AMD 
[14:28:01] <Hunterkll> i mean for me it's not even worth going dual 2080 Ti's since the upgrade isn't big enough to merit the cost 
[14:28:10] <Hunterkll> since i'd only be getting a 30% jump per-card over my 1080 Ti's 
[14:28:18] <lancehead> No idea what AMD GPUs are good though
[14:28:29] <sd> 13<C​olour> I kinda want an Intel Processor now
[14:28:41] <teh_f4ll3n> the only reason I got a 2060 Super over 1660Ti was finding one much cheaper
[14:28:51] <lancehead> I'm sticking with AMD processors because they're cheap 6 cores :p 
[14:29:06] <sd> 13<C​olour> Cheap 16 cores
[14:29:06] <Hunterkll> ah yea a 2060 super is like 25% faster than a 1660 ti 
[14:29:07] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:29:25] <sd> 13<C​olour> TBH the 12 cores are pretty nicely priced iirc
[14:29:33] <lancehead> teh_f4ll3n: Fun fact, I have a 1660 6GB Phoenix OC which are no longer being made. It's ASUS' shitty single fan card and they're going for like 650eur now LMAO 
[14:29:41] <lancehead> Bought it for 250 at the time 
[14:29:43] <teh_f4ll3n> lol
[14:30:04] <lancehead> It's a good card but it does run noticeably hotter 
[14:30:09] <Hunterkll> yea, waiting to see what HEDT parts drop out of intel before upgrading
[14:30:16] <Hunterkll> and what the next Rampage Extreme board looks like

[14:30:27] <SirSceptalot> LUNCH HOUR
[14:30:35] <lancehead> I need to clean my PC, starting to get noisy 
[14:30:36] <Hunterkll> if i'm gonna get two 3090 Ti's or whatever might as well do the whole kit at once
[14:30:39] <Hunterkll> instead of just a CPU upgrade
[14:31:01] *** Joins: csrf (~csrf@user/csrf)
[14:31:06] <Hunterkll> but then there's all the 4090 rumors too
[14:31:08] <Hunterkll> so *shrug*
[14:31:23] <Hunterkll> if anything is re motely true about the 4090 rumors it might be the first time I could get away with a single card system in forever
[14:31:29] <lancehead> If we don't get an RTX 420 I'm going to riot 
[14:32:26] <teh_f4ll3n> MSI NVIDIA GEFORCE RTX 2060 SUPER VENTUS GP OC, lancehead

[14:33:48] <teh_f4ll3n> RTX 420 BLAZEIT OC EDITION?
[14:34:43] <lancehead> Nice!
[14:35:07] <teh_f4ll3n> I honestly just want to plunk a 3700X in, but that's not much of an upgrade, I don't think
[14:35:23] <lancehead> What CPU do you currently have? 
[14:35:28] <teh_f4ll3n> 1700X
[14:35:51] <teh_f4ll3n> wait 3700X is cheaper than 3300X? what?
[14:36:11] <lancehead> It'll make a difference, that's a leap of two generations lol 
[14:36:15] <lancehead> Is it?
[14:36:33] <teh_f4ll3n> one an a half technicallt
[14:36:34] <teh_f4ll3n> y
[14:36:47] <lancehead> It's also about the same price as an R5 3600X... hmm 
[14:36:53] <lancehead> Might get an R7 instead 
[14:37:34] <teh_f4ll3n> 3800X only costs 16 euro more
[14:37:42] <teh_f4ll3n> hmmm.... early Xmas?
[14:37:46] <lancehead> ;o
[14:37:53] <lancehead> I can get me one when I get paid lol 
[14:38:23] <teh_f4ll3n> I can get one now on a CC and then just pay it with no % over the next 60 days
[14:38:40] <lancehead> Although I was gonna get a RAM upgrade for my laptop... choices, choices 
[14:39:00] <teh_f4ll3n> my issue is that I'd want a new mobo as well

[14:44:22] <teh_f4ll3n> that's a name I haven't heard in a good while... Fatal1ty
[14:44:44] <lancehead> Well no I'm making it seem worse than it is @kosh ; my apartment is only 25m2 and I also have my girlfriend next to me with her own rig
[14:45:03] <lancehead> And they both need cleaning 
[14:45:06] <lancehead> So it gets warm over time lol 
[14:45:35] <lancehead> It's a good mobo! @ teh_f4ll3n
[14:46:00] <lancehead> Had to turn off the blinky RGB light on it though because it'd stay on when my PC was off at night, which is not great in a one room apartment 
[14:46:05] <sd> 03<k​osh> but using heat like that for heating is a cool thing. In some places companies who produce a lot of heat transfer it to another company for heating during winter

[14:56:23] <Hunterkll> i've looked at some airsoft and paintball kit i've really wanted
[14:56:35] <Hunterkll> but i just don't get out enough to those events to justify it
[14:56:39] <thegodsquirrel> Paintball is cool
[14:56:41] <Hunterkll> but i'd love to refit my old kit like I used to have  
[14:56:52] <Hunterkll> there was one kit i saw that was fucking AWSOME
[14:56:56] <Hunterkll> uses .44cal paintballs, I th ink
[14:57:00] <lancehead> thegodsquirrel: I know the basics of room clearing and some small squad tactics but I'm probably still going to get peppered in the face 
[14:57:05] <Hunterkll> but each one was loaded into a casing, and the casings ejected properly, etc
[14:57:09] <thegodsquirrel> But you can buy a little bit of kit and be competitive

[14:59:20] <Hunterkll> i need to check my IFAK and see if it's missing anything at some point an yway....
[14:59:38] <thegodsquirrel> and probably more expensive than an actual M4 Hunterkll 
[14:59:38] <lancehead> They have a working bolt carrier group, they're prettttttty cool

[23:36:52] <shibboleth> or hdparm on *nix
[23:37:10] <shibboleth> or just use the utility provided by the ssd brand/oem
[23:37:55] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> it all depends on the particular scenario
[23:38:16] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> if i'm on a machine without the oem/ssd brand tools, then windows disk manager it is
[23:39:41] <shibboleth> again: you won't actually erase any data
[23:39:55] <shibboleth> a 250GB ssd actually has about 1tb of storage
[23:40:02] <shibboleth> well, twice or more
[23:40:33] <shibboleth> if you use diskpart erase all, only one "layer" will be overwritten
[23:40:46] <catbeard> onoes, muh partitions!
[23:40:50] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Infosec sent some phishing emails and this one just about got me

[23:41:05] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Feel free to reuse.
[23:41:11] <shibboleth> if you do a diskpart clean (not all), create an empty part and issue a TRIM command with powershell you will, however have erased the other layers
[23:41:58] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> you... you fell for that?
[23:41:58] <shibboleth> excluding the empty space before and after the partition
[23:42:13] <shibboleth> better just issue ATA erase with WMIC, hdparm or whatever
[23:42:16] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Yea for like 5 seconds.
[23:42:21] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Didn't click the link
[23:42:30] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> But was like "o hey that's cool"
[23:42:33] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Wait....
[23:42:42] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> shibboleth: is there any chance of data recovery after doing that
[23:42:43] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> ?
[23:43:21] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> shibboleth: that just seems like extra work for the same end result IMO
[23:43:24] <shibboleth> after ata erase? well... they say "no", but who really knows
[23:43:38] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> no after "if you do a diskpart clean (not all), create an empty part and issue a TRIM command with powershell you will, however have erased the other layers"
[23:43:45] <shibboleth> yes
[23:44:06] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> is that your company domain .net?
[23:44:14] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> that would be a dead giveaway
[23:44:18] <PublicWiFi> what a day its been boys
[23:44:33] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> also
[23:44:35] <shibboleth> takes less than a hundredth of the time (compared to what you suggested) and actually does erase the contents, as opposed to your way
[23:44:38] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> no
[23:44:39] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> that's not outlook is it?
[23:44:55] <vinrock> ll of win10, first time running edge it gives you a fullscreen ad for microsoft coupons now
[23:44:57] <vinrock> ugh
[23:45:00] <vinrock> s/ll/full
[23:45:01] <layer8> vinrock meant: "full of win10, first time running edge it gives you a fufullscreen ad for microsoft coupons now"
[23:45:01] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> though we own that domain
[23:45:06] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> And it's the web client
[23:45:29] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> yeah the fact that domain is owned is a dead giveaway
[23:45:30] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> lol
[23:45:38] <sintax> vinrock:  best part is no matter how hard you try to remove edge MS has links that only open in Edge so you'll get a blank page
[23:45:46] <TurkeyGibby> maccas: tell me about it. Absolute shitshow here.

[23:52:45] <Activ8> 2021 LTSC activates with the 2019 KMS key
[23:53:07] <ender> what's the 2021 LTSC build number?
[23:53:42] <Activ8> 21H2 19044.1288
[23:54:09] <Activ8> https://i.imgur.com/rZIC5Ld.png
[23:57:22] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Of course 2021 LTSC activates with the 2019 KMS key
[23:57:43] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> That's good old MS for you
[23:58:00] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> It doesn't activate though, you'll need a KMS server for that
[23:58:14] <Activ8> I have one, 3 official business ones
[23:58:36] <shibboleth> kinda screwy by msft to only support 21h2 ltsc through 2026
[23:58:45] <shibboleth> instead, they're gonna support 1809 ltsc until 2029
[23:58:50] <Activ8> by then windows 11 will be fully mainstream
[23:58:52] <shibboleth> out of... spite, i guess
[23:59:23] <Activ8> infact I'm going guess another OS making it's way out to public by then
[23:59:25] <shibboleth> "nah, better to support an even older codebase for three additional years"
[23:59:47] <ender> 1809 kinda makes sense, since that's Server 2019, too
