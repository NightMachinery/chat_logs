[00:01:22] <tabakhase> orzel so write it down once in a file called ".env" next to the compose-file containing "My_DB=1.2.3.4"- and put "$My_DB" in the compose file itself
[00:03:13] <tabakhase> the syntax ${APP_ENV:-prod} allows for "inline defaults" as well - for someone who hasnt set it / didnt create the ".env"
[00:04:34] <tabakhase> and this kinda is "entirely seperate from whats thrown in environment:" - but you can totally have a "environment: - DB_HOST=$My_DB"
[00:05:25] <tabakhase> (also try the  "docker-compose config" command for easy debugging of this stuff :P - that prints what it read&parsed to terminal)
[00:07:45] <Ryu_> If a server has to LAN IPs ( from being manually assgined), is that compatible with docker?  Can you have a docker container on each LAN IP?
[00:07:53] <Ryu_> I mean *two*
[00:08:09] <tabakhase> Ryu_ sure that
[00:08:42] <tabakhase> -p 1.2.3.4:80:80 && -p 9.7.6.5:80:80 will work jut fine
[00:09:24] <Ryu_> tabakhase: Any idea why deploying NGINX on both 1.2.3.4 and 1.2.3.5 will cause the first one to crash and the second one to not work?
[00:09:56] <Ryu_> First one only starts to work when I delete the second one.
[00:10:06] <tabakhase> uh? i feel youll have to prepare a nopaste for this :D
[00:11:00] <tabakhase> also "work" - does only that forward break, or anything more? (containers networking within themself&to host remains all good?)
[00:11:36] <tabakhase> and what happens when you attach both to the same? (be it with both -p´s or as -p 80:80)
[00:13:38] <Ryu_> tabakhase: I am using different IPs since they both need the same ports.   (80 and 443).   By broken I mean the container itself crashes and keeps on crashing.
[00:14:25] <Lutin> Bossi so I'm still not sure what I shall do :)
[00:14:41] <Ryu_> Thus, nothing it working since it is a crashing container.  It stops crashing when I delete the new container.
[00:16:01] <Ryu_> That is why I was wondering if there is some limitation with Docker
[00:16:48] <Ryu_> I noticed the app containers that connect to NGINX were not crashing.  Only the NGINX container.  I am not sure if the Letsencrypt container crashed.
[00:18:01] <Ryu_> tabakhase: My planned setup is to have each LAN IP with its own NGINX container, Letsencrypt container and associated app containers.  Every LAN IP will be a different app.
[00:18:37] <Ryu_> I have one app deployed on one LAN IP so far.
[00:19:04] <tabakhase> as said "crashing" doesnt mean much... who even knows what you consider "crashing" ;-) --- so nopaste, a) your network config (ip addr, feel free to redact) b) docker commands / compose files youre running & respective dockerfiles if anythign is custom
[00:21:14] <tabakhase> oh and obv any output youre getting / docker logs calls from those / any actual error messages you see if any...

[00:33:04] <Ryu_> I noticed it did not crash my containers deployed on my first IP this time.
[00:36:43] <Ryu_> tabakhase: Do those logs mean anything to you or anyone?
[00:37:57] <orzel> tabakhase: i understand that. But as said, this is not what i want. I dont want to 'configure' or whatever. I want a path to be used in different place. This shouldn't be in a separate file. There's not 'env', unversioned env file or whatever. Just plain ol'constant.
[00:37:59] <tabakhase> Ryu_ i dont see anything "crashing" there
[00:38:10] <orzel> it seems impossible actually. not impressed by dockercompose files :/

[00:42:52] <Ryu_> tabakhase: what is strange is the exact setup worked for the first application
[00:43:31] <tabakhase> are you bind mounting stuff in there to hold the certs or so? different chmods on that? different user container is running at or any of that?
[00:44:46] <tabakhase> but ye, none of that should have anything todo with the ip/published ports =)
[00:45:31] <orzel> tabakhase: that's more about factorizing same args for services. Nice, but not what i want. Typically the env var will be different on each docker service  for the common path/ipaddress 
[00:45:47] <orzel> there's definitely a lack of constant i think
[00:47:11] <tabakhase> orzel anchros work at all sorta levels and deepmerge - so unless the name fo the actual var you want to set is different you can still use it -- if now you actually have "BLA=blub" in one, and "MOE=blub" in the other, this "blub" is what you want to group?
[00:48:01] <Ryu_> tabakhase: orzel Here is the docker compose file https://pastebin.com/j4NJ8K34
[00:50:10] <tabakhase> Ryu_ line 21...?
[00:51:22] <Ryu_> tabakhase: Only letsencrypt module is suppose to be able to write to it.   the NGINX proxy should only be able to read it.  It was recommended by the creator of the image.
[00:51:35] <tabakhase> and did you pull that from somewhere else? a volume on /usr/share/nginx/html has a bad smell....
[00:51:37] <Ryu_> It worked fine for a different deployment
[00:52:27] <Ryu_> tabakhase: I took this off of a NextCloud deployment.  I wasn't sure what was needed and what was not.  I left everything I saw for NGINX
[00:52:44] <orzel> tabakhase: yes for 'blub'
[00:52:44] <Ryu_> That was the first application deployed
[00:53:00] <Ryu_> I am using this on a homeassist deployment
[00:54:33] <Ryu_> tabakhase: Is there something I should be aware of for /usr/share/nginx/html?
[00:54:52] <tabakhase> orzel i think then you are actually out of luck unless youre okay with creating a .env file (generally shouldnt be in git, but maybe youre the one exception/month...)
[00:55:47] <tabakhase> or just whack a "run `echo 'path=/bla/blub' > .env` before first boot" into the readme :P
[00:56:58] <tabakhase> Ryu_ well without knwoing the container/app - how does it update? by pulling new images? - great, now your OLD volume with OLD code will be reused ontop of the new image :D
[00:58:20] <tabakhase> ((some containers expect that, and have mechanics to "share the frontend" files or such ((ive seen entrypoints do cp/rsync from one path to the shared-space-path)) -)
[00:58:40] <Ryu_> tabakhase: Your saying I should ask the creator of that NGINX/letsencrypt combo and ask about it
[00:59:05] <tabakhase> more the haas image - and in doubt, dont :P
[00:59:43] <tabakhase> uhm actually scrolling further in your file - you dont even use it?
[00:59:59] <Ryu_> tabakhase: the has image has nothing to do with that volume that.  That is something only used by the letsencrypt/NGINX containers
[01:00:21] <Ryu_> it is used in NGINX/letsencrypt.  It is only for that I believe
[01:00:33] <tabakhase> Ryu_ yea so lemme correct myself there - as volume for that use (.well-known) thats just fine
[01:00:57] <tabakhase> your name "homeassist_html" completly threw it in before even reading the haas container itself m)
[01:01:19] *** Quits: Brainium (~brainium@user/brainium) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[01:01:56] <Ryu_> I have it named to show the project it is associated with
[01:02:29] <Ryu_> Since I will have a nextcloud NGINX/letsencrypt contaienr and a homeassist NGINX/letsencrypt contaienr
[01:02:47] <tabakhase> compose already does this tho :P -- defaults to "parent folder" so haas/docker-compose.yaml becomes hass_nginx and so on :P
[01:02:58] <tabakhase> happens to services, but also volumes & networks
[01:03:42] <Ryu_> Well I have a naming convention I already started :)
[01:04:07] <Ryu_> Any idea what could be wrong though?  The container just restarts
[01:04:17] <tabakhase> so anyhow, from the logs whoever is trying to write the cert cant, and then nginx goes poof cause it cant find a cert on disk
[01:05:25] <tabakhase> dunno if that nginx tries to generate some selfsigned staging-cert or so (cause on first boot you obvs. dont have valid LE-certs yet) so nginx has to start either "without any https configured" or with a dummy
[01:06:19] <Ryu_> tabakhase: I noticed the first time I ran this, it activated my letsencrypt container on my nextcloud setup.   I wonder if there is an issue with having more then one letsencrypt containers on different LAN IPs.
[01:06:35] <tabakhase> ((on a offtopic, while im a nginx fan - as ingress for docker i had better results with traefik or caddy where docker is a bit more "first party"...))
[01:07:07] <tabakhase> Ryu_ "container_name: homeassist-letsencrypt" his bypasses the per-project naming
[01:08:04] <tabakhase> so yae, that may have fired your other container (saw it doesnt match, killed & made a new one) if compose thinks it belongs in the same stack... - otherwise it should have yelled about duplicate container name
[01:08:38] <tabakhase> tho your nextcloud le shouldnt have a haas name uh... im confsed :D
[01:09:01] <Ryu_> One lets encrypt container is name nextcloud-letsencrypt and is on LAN IP 1.2.3.4  .  The other is homeassist-letsencrypt and is on 1.2.3.5

[03:28:49] <Lutin> Germans are cool people, I like them
[03:29:53] <Bossi> so, i am wondering what you really want to achieve running a vswitch in a container, and how to get it connected in the first place to some "outside" entity to get some VLAN-trunk
[03:30:53] <Bossi> and the second part is, how to connect something to said vswitch outside of the container, or will there be a docker instance in the same container as the vswitch?
[03:32:03] <Lutin> yeah good question. I want to VPN into my docker "network"
[03:32:21] <Lutin> so I don't need any trunk to the outside world... but maybe later on...
[03:32:30] <Bossi> Dutch are also cool people, it mostly does not rely on your origin

[03:51:58] <Bossi> currently i am very busy with a project, not much time left for anything else. After that want to restructure my server environment at home including VMs and containers, making everything redundant, upgrading to 10GBit
[03:52:14] <Lutin> or this one https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-use-an-ovs-bridge-for-networking-on-docker 
[03:52:36] <Lutin> yeah we are deploying new services for a project, this came to mind
[03:52:44] <Lutin> so I'm gonna test it anyways
[03:53:09] <Bossi> yes, native support for ovs is imho still missing in docker, so i start container without network at all and connect them with ovs-docker to the switch
[03:53:36] <Lutin> yap
[03:53:46] <Lutin> so you don't use swarm as wel I guess ?
[03:53:50] <Bossi> sometimes docker has strange ideas when you start containers with more than one network
[03:53:52] <Lutin> *well
[03:54:02] <Lutin> indeed, doesn't add up
[03:54:32] <Bossi> no, atm most of the containers should not float around, this is something i want to change in the future
[03:55:54] <Bossi> and the other project i mentioned where i relied on specific VLANs connected directly to containers running honeypots for each network segment, there were no redundant docker hosts

[03:57:28] <Lutin> ah kewl!

[03:58:31] <Lutin> k8s
[03:58:48] <Bossi> everything i found on the net regarding honeypots uses almost the same blueprint, but all of them lacked the large scale approach while i wanted to be able to deploy them worldwide with several hundreds of nodes
[03:59:09] <Lutin> yeah same thing here
[03:59:22] <Lutin> but what kind of services are you doing ? IoT ?
[04:00:00] <Bossi> you need to think about the whole life cycle, installation, deployment, running, fixing broken devices, ....

[04:00:40] <Bossi> no it was in a huge enterprise having offices all over the world for placing those in internal networks to detect malicous activities

[04:22:09] <Bossi> which imho is a lot of efford when you just want to run one docker host, so stick with docker run or get docker-compose elsewhere. On the other hand you should skip using the docker version at all from some distros because it is outdated even when the distro is brand new

[04:42:49] <Bossi> to play with cluster features i need at least 2 or more "servers" to build some, it would be nice to have a swarm-cluster and other clusters orchestrated differently at the same time, to see what the pros and cons are
[04:44:08] <Bossi> and you need to be able just to "pull the plug" to see if your idea of failover or high availability is working, i saw a lot of installations where ppl just looked sad after some problem hit them
[04:44:34] <Bossi> it just worked in their powerpoint slides
[04:47:16] <Lutin> yeah, I'm a HA guy so... I'm not afraid :)
[04:47:23] <Bossi> i used to design, setup and run complete infrastructure services providing DHCP, DNS, LDAP and other stuff using VMware and LinuxVMs, using LVS for loadbalancing, nowadays i would think about a setup using containers for several aspects
[04:48:00] <Lutin> we need some webservice we replicate over 3 DC's... we do DNS failover with LUA... so... if a server fails... you don't get the record anymore because of... looooooooowwwwwwww TTL
[04:48:36] <Lutin> yeah I did oVirt/Foreman/etc for a couple of years on a 26 server cluster with netapp storage
[04:48:45] <Lutin> that set was masive
[04:48:53] <Lutin> 1TB of mem back the days :D
[04:49:06] <Lutin> 40TB storage
[04:49:55] <Bossi> zpool list:
[04:50:15] <Lutin> yeah, I do guster now
[04:50:17] <Bossi> big   87.2T  79.1T  8.12T        -         -    59%    90%  1.00x  ONLINE  -
[04:50:19] <Lutin> gluster
[04:50:25] <Lutin> nice
[04:50:35] <Lutin> yeah I did that 40TB already 8 years ago :D
[04:50:52] <Lutin> or no, 9!
[04:50:53] <Bossi> 128TB in total disks for that zpool
[04:50:59] <Lutin> :)
[04:51:01] <Lutin> nice
[04:51:14] <Lutin> not realy slow with that much parity ?
[04:51:20] <Lutin> *really
[04:51:26] <Bossi> it is sufficient for my use case
[04:51:30] <Bossi> i need space
[04:52:10] <Bossi> 8x12TB disks, nowadays i would use 16TB or 18TB disks
[04:52:42] *** Quits: CombatVet (~c4@user/combatvet) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[04:52:58] <Bossi> i use zfs on linux since 2009, started with zfs-fuse
[04:53:52] <Bossi> also thought about scaling up things using ceph and instead of cepf-fs put some zfs on top
[04:54:11] <Lutin> nah... ceph has it's issues 
[04:54:22] <Bossi> everything has its "issues" :D

[04:59:45] <rawtaz> Bossi: about running ZFS on top of Ceph, what would you say is a proper recordsize and ashift?
[05:00:49] <Bossi> we didnt implement such thing yet, just discussed this with a friend as a potential scale up, since he is expierenced using ceph already
[05:01:52] <rawtaz> ok
[05:02:15] <rawtaz> i use zfs on ceph in a VPS or two
[05:02:21] <Lutin> hehe yeah ceph can be nice
[05:02:33] <Lutin> I think ZFS would help you as good as well too
[05:02:41] <Bossi> i use snapshots very intensivly, while ceph-fs has very limited capacity for those, and ceph-fs should also not used as a multi-node setup, so using zfs has the advantage of having the nice snapshot features, and extensibility will be better
[05:03:37] <rawtaz> its nice alright
[05:04:00] <Bossi> when i currently try to expand a zpool i need at least spend a zmirror, or a new zraid2 set, while using ceph, i just provide a blockstorage device and zfs does not need to replicate data, this is handled by the ceph layer
[05:04:51] <rawtaz> yeah exactly
[05:05:07] <Bossi> u just need enough bandwidth between the storage nodes
[05:05:42] <Bossi> nice to meet someone which already does what we thought about years ago :D
[05:06:09] <rawtaz> oh its on a small scale, but i agree its nice :D
[05:07:20] <Bossi> thats also the reason why i already bought 10GBit switches to have some decent bandwidth around
[05:07:33] <rawtaz> what do you store on this stuff?
[05:08:05] <Bossi> different kind of data, almost 100TB of public media servers, backups, ....
[05:08:18] <rawtaz> ok
[05:10:25] <Bossi> just checked with lsblk how much disk i have on one server 308.5TB
[05:12:19] <Lutin> yap... but that bandwidth can be the issue later on
[05:12:32] <Bossi> but its meanwhile a lot of disks connected by USB3
[05:12:42] <rawtaz> that doesnt sound right
[05:13:08] <Lutin> yeah ? cool... does that work out well ?
[05:13:12] <Bossi> therefore the idea to scale it with ceph
[05:15:04] <Lutin> I love the idea of USB
[05:15:12] <Lutin> but, what kind of USB disks ?
[05:16:08] <Bossi> for "low speed" i use disk cabinets with 8 slots and one USB3 connection to get them connected at least
[05:16:25] <Lutin> the issue with USB is that you don't know which disk is connected where most of the time
[05:16:37] <Lutin> oka
[05:16:42] <Lutin> which cabinets ?
[05:16:48] <Bossi> i use labels to mount them, regardless where they appear
[05:16:58] <Lutin> yeah sure but ports... 
[05:17:01] <Lutin> always an issue
[05:17:17] <Lutin> but I think data transfer isn't that slow 
[05:17:23] <Bossi> had no issues so far, even when power down
[05:17:44] <Lutin> :)
[05:17:45] <Bossi> i can saturate my GBit Internet link while writing to the disks :D
[05:17:53] <Lutin> hehe
[05:18:01] <Lutin> that's easy
[05:18:12] <Lutin> I could even do that with 6GB bonds :D
[05:18:35] <Bossi> the older 2TB disks were really slow ...
[05:18:42] <Lutin> anyways, I need to sleep now, it's for sure :D
[05:18:48] <Bossi> gn8 Lutin
[05:18:54] <Lutin> thanks1

[18:42:32] <rawtaz> i happened to notice that azure has support for uploading a docker-compose file. but i'd be surprised if the others doenst have it as well
[18:43:04] <rawtaz> that said, "easily deploy with docker compose" to me would be equal to "easily setting up a VPS" which is pretty much any cloud service provider. i'd recommend hetzner.cloud
[18:43:11] <rawtaz> they have the best control panel :)
