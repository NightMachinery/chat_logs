[01:27:05] <gilberth> Emacs scrolls way more, but then they believed that they could implement a better scroll bar, too. Which I don't like at all.
[01:27:38] <humasect> i'm on trackpad and mouse is too, but there is a special new emacs hack for pixel scroll :
[01:28:16] <gilberth> Ah that's an Emacs variable. /me edits his .emacs
[01:28:20] <humasect> http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/etc/NEWS?id=5d6e1c749a669d33db2936b106ae41ce59473ea1 
[01:28:21] -ixelp- emacs.git - Emacs source repository
[01:28:38] <humasect> also better-pixel-scroll-mode is built in
[01:29:37] <gilberth> My question is now what Emacs hackers believed. That have bad taste wrt to GUIs anyway and are no authority. But what one would expect. On my Mac it seems to be that everything BUT Emacs scrolls by about one line with one tick of the wheel.
[01:29:54] <gilberth> * is not what Emacs
[01:30:14] <humasect> same with windows, really
[01:30:30] <humasect> on linux it feels more controlled because every UI bit acts differently =)
[01:31:10] <gilberth> Hmm, I could have a look at Windows. Which version? Are there differences.
[01:31:57] <gilberth> humansect: Yes, and this is why I don't like Emacs scrolling fast, but (thanks!) know I fixed the mouse-wheel-scroll-amount.

[01:32:58] <gilberth> I also don't like that I can't click the scroll-bar with Emacs to scroll to that position. I have to grab the thumb and drag it there. Annoying.
[01:33:09] <humasect> afaik any windows, it just acts differently (with X backend, or win32, etc)

[01:34:19] * moon-child wonders why one would want to click on scrollbars anyway, but will keep quiet about that
[01:34:38] <humasect> the trackpad on macos (monterey) scrolls beautifully
[01:34:45] <gilberth> I'll boot Windows 7 then, Windows 10 is too slow and see what cmd.exe does and a web browser.

[01:50:06] <humasect> okay that is really old emacs, running with X11
[01:50:27] * hayley tries to build ancient SBCL.
[01:50:42] <humasect> all these things fixed and not a worry, emacs works lovely for me on macOS 12.3
[01:50:49] <hayley> Something decides that it should introduce -fPIE into linking, breaking everything, but -fPIE doesn't appear anywhere in the sources.
[01:50:57] <gilberth> Notice the hexcode there it's #x2D, a mere #\- And that is not available?

[01:52:11] <moon-child> ah, nice!
[01:52:27] * moon-child names his machines after trees which are also human names.  I may run out of names soon...
[01:52:48] * hayley provides -no-pie and now has a working SBCL runtime. Whew.
[01:53:24] <White_Flame> our machines are typically named after anime characters, those will never run out
[01:53:39] <White_Flame> (although I guess they do reuse given names a lot)
[01:53:39] <hayley> I use technically true statements. "MOST-LIKELY-A-LAPTOP" "I-AM-NOT-A-BURNING-BUILDING"
[01:53:56] <gilberth> humansect: No, it was an attempt to build an up-to-date Emacs with X11. What I use daily is Emacs 24.5.1 with macos.
[01:54:05] <White_Flame> there's also a set of pony named machines, that's likely a pool of hundreds, too
[01:54:15] <moon-child> why x emacs, not cocoa emacs?
[01:55:08] <gilberth> XEmacs is dead. And why I wanted to use X11: I could have frames on two different displays.

[01:55:24] <White_Flame> didn't xemacs get merged back into emacs?
[01:55:38] <humasect> my human name is a tree
[01:55:43] <gilberth> As I have a laptop and a desktop here and I wanted one Emacs process display frames on each of the screens.
[01:55:46] <humasect> named from a tree that is
[01:55:49] <White_Flame> (and I presume "x emacs" != "xemacs" :) )
[01:55:55] <gilberth> Which with X11 works fine.
[01:56:21] <humasect> gilberth: macs can do that themselves like airplay and screen mirror 
[01:56:47] <gilberth> Yeah kewl, streaming bitmaps. This will sure be fast.
[01:57:13] <hayley> Just buy an iRouter or something.
[01:57:19] <humasect> called video
[01:57:38] <White_Flame> gilberth: it ends up being faster than current alternatives
[01:57:40] <humasect> oh no its hmm i dont think its pure video... 
[01:57:52] <moon-child> on local net, streaming video will be fast
[01:58:09] <White_Flame> we have lots of bandwidth available per latency
[01:58:14] <gilberth> I don't want to screen a video. Have you calculated how much bandwidth you would need for a mere 2560x1440 at 60Hz?
[01:58:24] <moon-child> well, presumably you h264 or w/e
[01:58:28] <White_Flame> I use VNC of 4k displays
[01:58:43] <White_Flame> through not-that-great connections
[01:59:02] <moon-child> on wifi, I have 3-4ms ping rtt and 40mb/s transfer between my laptop and desktop
[01:59:03] <moon-child> that is plenty
[01:59:38] <moon-child> and that is from a different room.  In the same room, I think I got more like 1-2ms
[01:59:38] <humasect> just use plain color for desktop and limited UI for easy compress 
[01:59:45] <White_Flame> VNC through SSH through crappy free wifi across the net to real 4k machine
[01:59:52] <gilberth> Funny, in my experience a <1ms ping 1Gbps LAN isn't suffice for VNC.
[01:59:56] <hayley> What if you wanted to compile old SBCL but then SBCL said debugger invoked on a UNDEFINED-ALIEN-ERROR: Undefined alien: "waitpid" 
[02:01:04] <humasect> White_Flame: sometimes we arent supposed to eat the fruits we cannot reach 
[02:01:24] <humasect> hayley: muscl
[02:01:30] <White_Flame> I'm saying VNC in that configuration is way faster & more reliable than X11 over it
[02:01:38] <gilberth> And btw this WiFi here really kind of sucks. I ought to have my own LAN in my room.
[02:01:38] <humasect> ohhh
[02:01:40] <White_Flame> having VNC retain state between lost connections is huge, too
[02:02:00] <humasect> server time was still expensive in X10-X11 days =) 
[02:03:51] * hayley now wonders where waitpid is defined, since it is not in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
[02:04:26] <pl> hayley: check if waitpid is not a preprocessor macro...
[02:05:23] <hayley> Sure. But modern SWCL^WSBCL still calls waitpid.

[02:08:42] <moon-child> (or 2.nn, w/e)
[02:10:08] <hayley> Ah, now I can find waitpid in both libc.so.6 and libc-2.31.so
[02:15:53] <hayley> Seems that FOREIGN-SYMBOL-ADDRESS itself is busted.

[02:37:56] <gilberth> On that note: The CLIM spec says the default is 2 pixels to be added. On each side for a total of 4. Which is the 1.25 for a font-size of 16px tall, which again matches well with 12pt at 96 DPI. 12pt is a reasonable default size, and 96 DPI is a reasonable assumption for screens.

[07:59:17] <moon-child> so, I need the arc length of the intersections between a circle and a contour
[07:59:50] <moon-child> not bad, until you consider that 1) circle has to be broken into top half and bottom half; 2) could have more than two intersections with a given curve; 3) contour is made of many curves, so you have to step on/off
[08:02:01] <mfiano> Maybe I should check some reputable color libraries for citations, whatever those reputable libraries are.
[08:02:22] <moon-child> oh no, this also breaks my space partitioning scheme

[14:31:06] <hayley> pjb: You do that by writing code like Jon Blow does, and never use bounds checks in production. Then it sets off the world's nuclear arsenal. Everyone dies simultaneously, which doesn't count as a civilisational "collapse" per se.
[14:32:10] *** Joins: szos (~user@tromso-studenter6-dhcp66.wifi.uit.no)
[14:32:50] <pjb> hayley: that's part of the answer, but it's more complicated.   Even the lisp ecosystem is stagnant.
[14:33:04] <hayley> Please (re)acquaint yourself with <https://plover.com/~mjd/misc/hbaker-archive/letters/CACM-DubiousAchievement.html> or die trying.

[14:40:49] <hayley> I mean, at the end of the day, the great irony is that the abstractions Blow claims are causing a "loss of capability" are precisely those that allow for any sort of mathematical reasoning. "Simplicity" cuts both ways, and perhaps in a worse-is-better way, he is more stuck up with implementation simplicity, when interface simplicity is more necessary to produce anything of quality.
[14:41:46] <hayley> pjb: IOW what a dumb thing to put in #lispcafe.
[14:43:09] <pjb> There are compromises to be made.
[14:43:40] <hayley> Bull.
[14:44:18] <humasect> just needs tree-shaking, lisp images do

[14:46:45] -ixelp- "Factoring Redundancy", Comm. of the ACM 34,5 (May 1991), 98-99.
[14:47:03] <hayley> "While much remains to be done in providing proper specifications for software systems to avoid high-level hazards, there are a number of low-level hazards for which redundancy tools already exist, but which are not currently being used.  We refer specifically to programming errors which cannot currently be caught by a compiler's typing system, but can be caught by a proper system of run-time type checking.  Reducing these hazards does not
[14:47:03] <hayley> require millions of dollars of R&D for "specification languages" or theorem-provers, but simply requiring that existing run-time type-checks always be enabled."
[14:47:50] <pjb> This is not the only answer.
[14:48:03] <hayley> humasect: That's not it. Blow believes that, by not diddling the pointers yourself, you are not able to program.
[14:48:12] <hayley> Which sure is funny to me.

[14:49:29] <pjb> :-)
[14:49:44] <pjb> Yes, debugging can be defered to the FAA or the Congress…
[14:50:00] <humasect> type inference + static typing goes a long way there, pointers won't matter -- C's optimization is to make everything flat/chacheable, linear. when a type system can fully validate a program's execution paths, it can be flattened as much as predictably and behaviorically correct 
[14:50:06] <hayley> So much for preventing the collapse of civilisation, I guess.
[14:50:33] <Gnuxie> probably appeals to nazi ideology to say only ubermensch chads can program with raw pointers to prevent the collapse of "western civilization" by soy femminisied programmers in safe garbage collected environments
[14:50:35] <hayley> ...I guess death-by-a-thousand-overflows doesn't count as a collapse, either.
[14:51:29] <Gnuxie> so not totally surprised a nazi would agree with blow 
[14:51:39] <humasect> "garbage collection" is somewhat a disrespectful term, i feel. it seems to promote or nurture the idea of "garbage" -- mindless allocations, waste product. if everything is nicely-coded, there is no waste (efficiency and simplicity) so i would rather personally call it automatic memory management.
[14:51:54] <hayley> humasect: You don't even need much static analysis to avoid most errors. Just do runtime checks. The result isn't the fastest, sure, but the implementation is simple, and performing checking is handled by the language, rather than the user.
[14:52:42] <humasect> hayley: that feels like getting rusty, more responsibility in the language (coder resources/cognitive load)
[14:53:13] <hayley> Being able to "let it crash" lets you restart from a known-good state, which gives better reliability than going off into UB land.
[14:53:14] <humasect> so the city looks like a construction safety zone rather than parks and makeshift homes
[14:53:46] <hayley> humasect: More like how managed languages have worked...forever. Though let-it-crash is associated with Erlang more than anything.
[14:53:51] <humasect> ehh i've never caught on to that "let it crash" mode of erlang coding. 
[14:54:18] <hayley> It's a miniature version of "turn it off and turn it on again".
[14:54:22] <humasect> {{the_logs, {are_so, true, true, often}, complex_lists, {{of, 1}, many, more_lists}}}}}
[14:54:31] <hayley> Feels dirty, but it's effective.
[14:54:56] <humasect> ah yeah. i often wish i had paper i can fully-clear like etch-a-sketch 
[14:55:18] <humasect> but in C world and also FP world (hask,ocaml) the whole program is restarted usually anyway
[14:55:41] <hayley> FP, sure. C, depends on what you check yourself.
[14:55:48] <humasect> in lisp i can imagine a lot of floating stuff going on which needs cleaning or restarting during dev. dangling references
[14:55:58] <humasect> C is edit/compile/run
[14:56:00] <hayley> You can't count on a C program to segfault.
[14:56:20] <humasect> right. but if anything goes wrong, its restarted from main()
[14:56:56] <hayley> But people neglect checking for things going wrong, because it's more work in C!
[14:56:57] <pjb> Of course, another way to do it, is to build system like living systems, encompass the bugs and crashes, and recover from it as a matter of fact.  Biological bodies are full of bacteria, and always to some degree ill.  Health is not a binary property, it's just a state of equilibrium between our white cells and the foreign virii an bacteria.
[14:57:27] <hayley> I'd rather not, thanks.
[14:57:28] <pjb> A working system could be just in a state of equilibrium between bugs and corrective routines (condition handlers).
[14:57:57] <pjb> Robotics programming is basically building such systems, since we have to expect the unexpected from the external world.

[14:58:07] <humasect> hayley: heh, but after enough years (as a vet), those things are better prevented from coming up when you least expensive. being defensive in C is mostly normal. eg: void CheckNode (node_t *n) { if (!n) return; else { ...} };
[14:58:34] <pjb> You don't write a routine to set your position to x0 y0 in robotics. You write a routine to reduce the error of (x-x0) (y-y0).
[14:58:53] <pjb> More software could use those algorithms instead.
[14:58:59] <humasect> pjb: however with such a grand paintbrush, is a moldy rotting corpse a working system? 
[14:59:20] <humasect> mold/fungi/bugs are nature 'garbage' collection
[14:59:22] <pjb> It could still serve some purpose.
[14:59:36] <humasect> so it almost does not matter if a program works or not, is what you are saying ?
[14:59:49] <hayley> humasect: Not normal enough, if you get bored and throw AFL at a poorly developed C program.
[14:59:51] <humasect> if its rotten moldy, you can still marry it and take it to footie game and share tea ?

[15:00:07] <dave0> the windows file manager felt like that.. it would crash or lock up every other day, but after about 30 seconds of no response, windows would tear it down and run the file manager again
[15:00:38] <hayley> Having to do something more to achieve safety is learned, whereas being lazy and not writing checks is more natural (IMO).
[15:00:44] <humasect> pjb: about robot and reducing error, sounds like a job for Prolog =) (or haskell as a half-way point)
[15:01:10] <humasect> dave0: hehe, while (1) { exec("explorer.exe"); }

[19:29:26] <gilberth> It's a bit annoying with X11 that when you resize a window the window is resized by the window manage first exposing whatever was set as the background and only then the window is redrawn after the an exposure event for this causing flicker.

[19:30:28] *** Joins: Aurora_v_kosmose (~LispyLigh@user/lispylights)
[19:31:17] <gilberth> I wonder if someone ever thought about to change that. The window manager could send a resize request to the window instead. The application could then resize the window on its own. The application could anticipate the exposed region and send the drawing request just after the window reconfiguration.
[19:32:33] <gilberth> Or the application could setup the background pixmap of the window with the new content and set window gravity to none, the server will then blitter the backgrond pixmap right after actually resizing the window.
[19:33:15] <gilberth> This could be negotiated like any other window manager features by an appropriate property on the window.
[19:34:38] <gilberth> The only technical issue that I see is that window managers like to reparent, so the application would need to know the real parent of its window and resize that instead.
[19:34:41] <gilberth> *sigh*
[19:36:38] <gilberth> But these days those terrific composing window managers work differently. A kludge, if you ask me.

[21:26:56] <selwyn> i guess you have to compare it to whatever the number was before the pandemic, since unregistered schools have been a thing for a while
[21:28:58] <selwyn> gnuxie: did you used to wag it a lot
[21:29:42] <Gnuxie> naa i'd just try it on after i'd had a cold to get the whole week off
[21:32:13] <selwyn> now that boris has accused starmer of failing to prosecute jimmy savile, every facebook group in the country will have starmer down as a nonce defender
[21:32:53] <selwyn> conservatives (+ 20)
[21:32:59] * shka laughs
[21:33:10] <shka> selwyn: oh sweet summer child
[21:33:32] <shka> you have not yet witnessed the absurd depths of ultra-conservative politics
[21:35:28] <selwyn> not yet
[21:37:49] <shka> selwyn: in Poland we have serious attempt to make Jesus Christ officially the king of Poland
[21:37:57] <selwyn> oh i heard about that
[21:38:04] <shka> and well, that abortion stuff
[21:38:19] <shka> we are literally rednecks of Europe xD
[21:38:20] <selwyn> i visited poland in 2013 when there was this 'cross' movement
[21:38:24] <selwyn> where is the cross
[21:38:32] <shka> oh 
[21:38:45] <shka> that was cringe 
[21:38:55] <shka> a lot of stuff in Poland is cringe 
[21:39:13] <selwyn> i thought it was kind of boring for a fanatic movement
[21:40:45] <shka> we also have that organization called "Ordo Iuris" and they put a lot of effort into that abortion ban
[21:40:57] <shka> and recently they moved to fighting divorces
[21:41:03] <shka> but picture this
[21:41:21] <shka> organization had a split 
[21:41:54] <shka> because romance at the top 
[21:42:16] <shka> and the married couple just happens to get divorced because of that xD
[21:42:22] <selwyn> lol
[21:42:32] <shka> it is a barrel of laughs
[21:42:48] <selwyn> literally king henry viii
[21:43:14] <selwyn> fork your entire national church in order to divorce
[21:43:41] <shka> https://ordoiuris.pl/
[21:43:45] <shka> selwyn: so this is their logo
[21:43:49] <selwyn> how do these people view the rest of europe? hopelessly corrupted by liberalism?
[21:45:58] <shka> selwyn: and that logo is way better https://aszdziennik.pl/136936,ordo-iuris-zmienia-logo-lepiej-pasuje-do-nowego-wizerunku-organizacji

[21:46:13] <selwyn> hahaha
[21:46:45] <shka> so needless to say people in Poland have a chuckle right now :P
[21:47:18] <shka> as about their views i don't know honestly
[21:47:31] <shka> i don't hang around people like that
[21:47:45] <shka> because frankly, they are boring
[21:47:54] <selwyn> the england crest has three lions on it, which unfortunately is always an improper union (regardless of the genders)
[21:47:58] <shka> though apparently horny so maybe we have something in common
[21:49:08] <shka> my issue with those people is that they seem to simply follow rules 
[21:49:25] <shka> they never bothered to question them or internalize them
[21:50:33] <shka> or even consider to answer "what is moral?" question
[21:51:12] <shka> so honestly, they are boring and i have no desire to hang around 
[21:51:26] <selwyn> yeah boring
[21:51:37] <shka> but horny
[21:52:19] <shka> and that infidelity lady is kinda cute looking honestly 
[21:52:28] <selwyn> the british contingent of the insane tend to plump for american conspiracy theories, without developing their own ecosystem
[21:52:35] <selwyn> frankly its embarassing
[21:52:49] <shka> yeah
[21:52:53] <selwyn> people who live in the middle of rural england having opinions on qanon and trump
[21:53:20] <shka> i mean, i really think that UK will transform into USA colony eventually 
[21:53:28] <selwyn> cue the clash
[21:53:40] <shka> because history does not repeat itself
[21:53:44] <shka> but it rhymes
[21:55:32] <shka> selwyn: clash is not enough, you gonna need https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e8hyvV3YTw

[21:56:27] <selwyn> shka: i think the missing ingredient is that the usa doesn't care about the uk
[21:56:28] <shka> selwyn: wtf, it does not sound like the clash at all?
[21:56:48] <selwyn> you have to commit at some level in order to have a colony
[21:57:31] <shka> selwyn: not really, as long as the right people would profit, it can happen
[21:58:22] <selwyn> this one is a banger https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Dw_aj68Gqg

[21:58:42] <selwyn> shka: profit how
[21:58:44] <shka> new model army, good, good, good
[21:58:50] <shka> selwyn: by having money
[21:58:50] <selwyn> nhs selloff, i suppose
[21:59:03] <shka> use money to earn money
[21:59:04] <shka> capital
[21:59:39] <selwyn> in britain?
[21:59:54] <shka> capital knows no borders
[22:00:09] <shka> so in britain, or in usa
[22:00:29] <shka> if capital can grow by turning UK into USA colony it may happen
[22:01:04] <selwyn> well, i guess the point i am making is that: the powers that be in the usa don't seem to regard britain as a virgin economic frontier
[22:01:40] <selwyn> but if they can get it very cheaply - then who knows

[23:22:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> > i don't actually want to be part of a gentrifying tech wave pricing a city out of existence and into misery | That's actually a darkly amusing pattern. Cities only work if living in them is more convenient and practical than living remote. So actively undermining the few things that give a city advantages is counterproductive.

[23:50:09] <v3ga> can someone point me in the right direction for cleaning a cljs projects dependencies?  I've switched from shadow-cljs to figwheel-main. completely commented out the shadow dependencies and successfully started figwheel up. however it's still giving me a "shadow-cljs - Reconnecting" prompt at the bottom of the page
[23:50:18] <v3ga> i also deleted my target folder...no dice
[23:56:59] <ck_> you could try removing the package-lock file, node_modules and run npm install again
[23:58:25] <v3ga> ck_: yup, removed all of those and anything npm related. i moved to figwheel since i'm not using npm at all
