[01:58:41] <tm512> just the other day I got this 750Ti set up with nvidia's proprietary driver, but one issue I've noticed with it is that if I have two firefox windows open, and each one has a video playing, like an autoplay video or an ad, etc, my framerate tanks to fairly unacceptable levels, 
[01:59:05] <tm512> has anyone else run into this issue? it seems like my firefox setup is using as much hardware acceleration as it can
[02:02:39] <tm512> it also happens regardless of whether both windows are actually visible, and seems like it might be more about multiple windows having any kind of simultaneous updates, because even a page playing an animated gif seems to hurt performance in other firefox windows

[03:11:07] <moon-child> is there any way to make the mouse wheel scroll a page at a time, rather than a given number of lines?  This is a system option on windows, which firefox honours, but I am not using windows
[03:11:32] <moon-child> I know scroll amount is tunable w/about:config, but I was unable to get it to be the same as a pgup/pgdn, last I tried.  And that would not work with varying window sizes anyway
[03:16:25] <moon-child> 'Note that unlike 16 or earlier, you cannot specify the unit of delta values such as scrolling by pixel, line or page. I.e., you cannot specify the deltaMode value of DOM WheelEvent with any preferences. On Windows, the scroll unit is by line or page with mouse wheel. That depends on the system settings. On Mac, the scroll unit is by pixel or line. That depends on whether the device supports pixel
[03:16:27] <moon-child> scroll or not. On Linux, the scroll unit is always by line'   damn, apparently not
