[15:53:23] <brvadiraj46> I want to upgrade to elasticsearch 8.1 from 6.3
[15:53:32] <brvadiraj46> what is the correct procedure
[15:53:59] <brvadiraj46> we have elasticsearch hosted both in AWS and elastic cloud
[15:54:41] <brvadiraj46> creating a 8.1 cluster and reindexing all docs from 6.3 via remote reindex will it work?
[15:55:06] <brvadiraj46> I don't think this is a proper upgrade procedure

[16:09:04] <brvadiraj46> Instaed of going through multiple upgrade steps just reindexing will it work as upgrade...
