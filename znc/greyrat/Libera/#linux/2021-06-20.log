Receiver downstream is 1gbps. So I want to compress the stuff lightly so that I will at least skip any 0x00 areas fast... I tried xz but it seems that the cpu ends up being the bottleneck.

Other places may be jpegs or other high entropy stoff. So I just want to make sure I am not sending zeros at 100mbps when I could be  sending them basically as fast as the disk will read them if I compress them a bit.

[06:50:58] <Dagmar> If you don't see the new /dev/sd# devices appearing, it's because you didn't run partprobe to tell the kernel to rescan the device
[06:51:10] <[[R]]> fidks doesnt say no
[06:51:10] <Dagmar> FuriousGeorge: Yes you can
[06:51:14] <FuriousGeorge> spyroboy:  let me make sure.   [[R]]:  i mean that it says device or resource busy, changes will not take effect untilr eboot
[06:51:21] <[[R]]> ok, so reboot
[06:51:26] <Dagmar> You don't need to reboot.
[06:51:37] <rascul> partprobe it
[06:51:41] <FuriousGeorge> [[R]]:  normally i would, but i ran ./a_long_process three times concurrently and don't want to start over
[06:51:52] <[[R]]> then i guess you wait until you're done
[06:51:57] <spyroboy> well, no. don't reboot. I think that's FuriousGeorge's entire concern. he doesn't want to have to reboot to 'solve' a busy device problem.
[06:52:06] <Dagmar> You run `partprobe /dev/sdb` or whatever (or kpartx) to tell the kernel to re-examine the partition table.
[06:52:06] <Dagmar> Done.
[06:52:17] <[[R]]> well if hes' randomly kill -9'ing things
[06:52:17] <FuriousGeorge> interestingly as well, this disk was part of and md set that i stopped, and proceeded to repartition and format both disks
[06:52:26] <Dagmar> Just DO NOT do that with a partition you are using.  MAYHEM will result.
[06:52:36] <spyroboy> I'm fairly confident that the process holding onto the device is still there.

[07:07:19] <robin_> HI! I'm new to IRC and obviously Libera.Chat
[07:07:27] <Dagmar> I've defienitely seen two things mentioned that are almost universally the wrong thing, tho'.  Killing a stuck mount process generally accomplishes nothing, and umount -l is only really meant to be used in very particular circumstances by someone who knows _precisely_ what they're doing
[07:07:36] <Dagmar> Linux _will_ let you shoot yourself in the foot, with a chainsaw.
[07:07:46] <spyroboy> why are we still talking about the past?
[07:07:58] <sed> anyone hear about the google OS they are making?
[07:07:59] <spyroboy> that doesn't help him.
[07:08:02] <FuriousGeorge> spyroboy:  it shows a bunch of temp files being created by ./some_long_process, none of which are on the directory where the array of sdb and sda was mounted
[07:08:03] <Dagmar> It's only by learning from our mistakes that we can progress
[07:08:10] <sed> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fuchsia
[07:08:25] <FuriousGeorge> Dagmar:  that'
[07:08:33] <spyroboy> Dagmar, yes but he can't tell where he made the mistake specifically, so he learns nothing other than 'do nothing I did before' which might entail 'do not use linux'
[07:08:50] <spyroboy> we can help him by showing him how to find the problem so he can figure out where he caused it
[07:08:55] <FuriousGeorge> s a good analogy, but if it were so easy to do it would be done.
[07:08:58] <spyroboy> not but repeatedly telling him he fucked something up.

[07:12:07] <FuriousGeorge> well, the good thing is that some long processes will finish, and i've simply mounted sda1 where one of the processes expects sdb 1 to be, so i can reboot later

[07:18:00] <FuriousGeorge> Dagmar:  that's interetsting, but ./some_long_process loops, ending with writing a file to the disk.  it's the only thing that would be writing to the disk, and i made sure it was no where near that point when i unmounted
[07:18:04] <Dagmar> FuriousGeorge: That thing won't go away either until your process dies or is killed because while it might be separated from the directory tree, the inode will _not_ be freed until no process is using it anymore
[07:18:29] <FuriousGeorge> so it's basically floating around in ram invisible to the fs?
[07:18:33] <Dagmar> It'll also merrily prevent the admin from umounting that filesystem
[07:18:42] <spyroboy> I mean if we can stop distracting him, we'll be able to find out if there's an open reference to an inode
[07:18:46] <Dagmar> Yeah.  It _does_ exist on disk tho'.
[07:18:55] <Dagmar> It's just not currently attached to the directory tree anymore
[07:18:57] <spyroboy> FuriousGeorge, that ls -l command above cannot return nothing.

[07:48:30] <spyroboy> it's not like 'figuring out why my kernel is upset' is a computer science concept

[07:49:13] <FuriousGeorge> your analogy makes sense
[07:49:14] <spyroboy> there was obviously science involved in designing Honda engines but learning how one works and how to fix them is more about reading a manual

[07:49:49] <Dagmar> Mainly it's important you know which end of hte virgin goes into the volcano first.
[07:50:00] <FuriousGeorge> people who aren't tech savvy say i seam very tech savvy to them, and i often tell them engine mechanics are the folks who impress me

[07:53:14] <r3muxd> so i can figure out if it was patched upstream and i'm waiting for ubuntu to patch it, or if it's a legitimate bug i should file against upstream
[07:53:50] <Dagmar> r3muxd: if you go ahead and try to file it as a bug someone will probably be able to tell you what obscure thing you're missing that's why you seemed to need to make that change

[08:05:53] <Dagmar> Whatever mode it's in isn't going to be likely to impact the importance of Not Removing The Wrong Member Of A Failing Array
[08:06:29] <FuriousGeorge> seems like hardware raid is falling out of fashion now, am i wrong?
[08:06:36] <Dagmar> not really.
[08:06:48] <Dagmar> People are getting over their fascination with bullshit controllers tho
[08:07:03] <Dagmar> If it doesn't have a battery backed cache on it, there's basically no reason to have it around
[08:07:07] <FuriousGeorge> there's also that fascination with zfs, which does not like hardware raid
[08:07:24] <Dagmar> WEll, it tries to make some presumptions about disk behaviour

[08:08:29] <[[R]]> i cant' brlive it's not butter, fs
[08:08:40] <Dagmar> Basically, if it's "just" wrangling the array, the CPU is easily capable of doing that now
[08:08:44] <FuriousGeorge> im wondering something about server motherboards with integrated SAS controllers...  it seems like on the older model supermicros at least, they don't get pci lanes
[08:08:56] <Dagmar> ...and as an added bonus, things like mdadm aren't even a little bit proprietary
[08:09:10] <FuriousGeorge> so doesn't that mean they are just sata with a sas plug?
[08:09:31] <Dagmar> So, unless the thing has a cache on it that can prevent short writes and soft failures in the event of some power interruption, a hardware raid controller is more of a liability than a boon

[17:47:42] <hkm> oh i see what you mean
[17:48:03] <hkm> ok so  PATH=/foo:$PATH is used when /foo is not already in path but you wish to add it
[17:49:02] <hkm> PATH=/foo:/bin... is used when you want to assign the values for PATH from scratch. As you can see ':' is used as a separator for each directory
[17:49:18] <hkm> So basically let's assume PATH contains /abcd

[20:44:17] <AiwendilH> the usual reason why some people suggest removing module loading is to prevent loading of malicious kernel modules.

[22:00:10] <sumthing1980> I got ssh keys mixed up "The host key differs from the key for the ip ..." where do I fix this is there a gui
[22:00:28] <clemens3> in .ssh/known_hosts
[22:00:45] <clemens3> ssh-keygen -F and -R flags or such, man is your friend..
[22:00:46] <Dagmar> sumthing1980: Just ssh to it from a text console and it'll tell you which line of your known_hosts contains the offending key
[22:01:32] <iamtheworstdev> i feel like every guide i've followed to set up docker for this results in errors I haven't been able to figure out
[22:02:20] <sumthing1980> alright thanks

[23:45:28] <blackgatonegro> Do you have the mic is the right port? Maybe you plugged it in the onboard sound card by accident, that sound card tends to be disabled if you have a different sound card enabled.
[23:45:29] <Shenka> knull: yea but windows lol
[23:45:42] <moo> c705: nice joke, you can as well say emacs
[23:45:50] <Shenka> me trying to navigate and use windows feels like im swinging a hammer at a wall to make a temporary door
[23:45:55] <c705> where's the joke part?
[23:45:57] <xrogaan> smime is kind of shit.
[23:46:00] <HumbleGuy> blackgatonegro, my mic is integrated in the laptop

[23:46:20] <kodah> c705: is this one of drew devaults projects?
[23:46:31] <blackgatonegro> Okay go to the input devices tab and see if the mic is enabled there.
[23:46:34] <knull> Shenka: yeah i know im still finding it hard to make a complete switch to linux just because im so used to windows 10
[23:46:47] <c705> mutt is an mta. thunderbird is an mta.

[23:48:12] <Shenka> linux/GNU isnt as terrifying as people think it is. most of the fear comes from the unfamiliar
[23:48:33] <Dagmar> Turns out it's actually a bit easier to just generate an interface in HTML and Javascript than it is to deal with Qt/Gtk/WxWindows
[23:48:37] <moo> oh TIL, sorry. last i used it 10 years ago it was much less pleasant lol
[23:48:48] <moo> having postfix and all other stuff there
[23:49:05] <c705> mutt could connect via imap 10 years ago as well

[23:50:15] <eqw> my system has hanged: the keyboard doesn't respond for numlock(it is on), there's the same picture on the screen, even after me stopping LightDM. It responds via ssh, though. Is there something else I can try?

[23:53:56] * eqw doesn't use wayland
[23:53:59] <c705> X sucks
[23:54:21] <Dagmar> Wayland will be a valuable asset once they've chased down about a zillion edge cases
[23:54:21] <blackgatonegro> I am not quite sure whay wayland is besides something steam uses for games.

[23:55:04] <c705> yes, wayland is fine if you can live with the things that it breaks like screen sharing
[23:55:06] <xrogaan> or simply `service restart lightdm`
