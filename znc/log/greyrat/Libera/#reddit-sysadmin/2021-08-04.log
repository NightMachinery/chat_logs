[10:02:16] <xe0n> i would think that's device management lol

[10:02:38] <xe0n> i.e. you can accidently blow away my personal phone

[17:11:41] <bagpuss_thecat> USA healthcare is just... mind boggingly sucky sounding. Every. Time.
[17:12:07] <bagpuss_thecat> can speech therapy be obtained on medicare?
[17:12:09] <AnonymooseReddtr> but its not socialist ;)
[17:12:17] <bagpuss_thecat> lol
[17:12:20] <vinrock> that's one $55 in freedombux
[17:12:22] <vinrock> only
[17:12:30] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol vinrock fu
[17:12:39] <bagpuss_thecat> I think the vast majority of socialism decryers wouldn't know socialism if it hit them on the face
[17:13:01] <AnonymooseReddtr> but mah freedumbs
[17:13:02] <vinrock> isnt it a very simple definition
[17:13:02] <AnonymooseReddtr> right
[17:13:12] <vinrock> socialism = workers control means of production
[17:13:19] <bagpuss_thecat> < Braveheart 'freeeedom' >
[17:13:24] <vinrock> capitalism = individuals control the means of production
[17:13:29] <vinrock> or am i wong here
[17:13:32] <vinrock> wrong, too
[17:14:01] <vinrock> and communism would be the state controlling the means of production
[17:14:36] <AnonymooseReddtr> *shrugs* 
[17:14:38] <AnonymooseReddtr> i'm canadian
[17:14:42] <vinrock> i hear dat
[17:14:44] <AnonymooseReddtr> according to some of you we're communist
[17:15:48] <bagpuss_thecat> capitalism, socialism, communism, these aren't all mutually exclusive. You can, and need, components of everything in a healthy society
[17:16:07] <vinrock> right but we're talking extremes here just to define whats what
[17:16:14] <bagpuss_thecat> your government must be communist because it controls the side of the road you drive on
[17:16:35] <vinrock> that doesnt fi the definition i proposed tho
[17:16:56] <vinrock> it strictly has to do with the means of production
[17:17:00] <vinrock> not controlling the state
[17:18:13] <Jaelae> AnonymooseReddtr: yea i think i was paying $35 per visit before my insurance covered. now that they cover it is $140 but i owe $70. when i hit my deductible i owe $16. but when they see i have hit my deductible they charge $280 so they can get more money. then i end up oweing $30. which i argue with them about because its mad sketchy
[17:21:43] <AnonymooseReddtr> thats f'n weird
[17:21:47] <AnonymooseReddtr> how long you been doing speech therapy?
[17:22:02] <AnonymooseReddtr> honestly a lot of it is common sense once you get into things
[17:23:48] <Jaelae> man like 3 years
[17:23:56] <Jaelae> they kept saying oh this shoudl be fine after 1 year 
[17:24:08] <Jaelae> and still issues. we have had no luck enforcing things on our own but obviously thats where we are headed

[17:53:59] <mistiry> ohio is shit though. so many dying towns.
[17:54:10] <JollyRgrs> i'd just go to cincy if I got back again... maybe able to catch Votto and the redlegs
[17:54:29] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> like Dayton

[17:55:25] <vinrock> i did a lot of work in ohio
[17:55:34] <vinrock> i dont mean to be mean but yeah thats the most miserable place in the country
[17:55:40] <JollyRgrs> Votto is just a good man. he's good for the game and good for cincy
[17:55:44] <vinrock> mistiry i spent too much time in dayton
[17:55:52] <mistiry> it can be pretty. but theres just nothing there.
[17:56:09] <vinrock> its like western pa where all the towns are dead
[17:56:11] <vinrock> and idgi
[17:56:13] <mistiry> after steel moved offshore 
[17:56:16] <mistiry> same issue with PA
[17:56:17] <vinrock> ohio is a strategic location

[17:56:44] <JollyRgrs> well, i mean... louisville for UPS
[17:56:49] <vinrock> so paper products and shit, the stuf everyone needs that is the best central location to mfg and distribute

[18:20:39] <vinrock> 2004
[18:20:50] <PublicWiFi> my neighbor was an old dude and he hid in his closet that was built under his chimney
[18:20:51] <mistiry> no anderew was 90s
[18:20:52] <vinrock> i just remember the street signs and shit being blown out for years after that
[18:20:52] <JollyRgrs> andrew? no... that was like... 92?
[18:20:55] <vinrock> oh ok
[18:20:57] <vinrock> the one in 2004
[18:21:02] <mistiry> 2004 was Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne
[18:21:03] <PublicWiFi> literally the only thing that was standing in hishouse was his chimney and that closet, the rest was gone
[18:21:08] <vinrock> ivan i think it was
[18:21:13] <vinrock> dayum
[18:21:22] <JollyRgrs> i grand opened a best buy aug 13, 2004
[18:21:27] <mistiry> lol nice
[18:21:30] <vinrock> like a baus
[18:21:40] <vinrock> 2004 is when i went to a dotcom
[18:21:41] <mistiry> Charley actually hit twice, too
[18:21:47] <JollyRgrs> yup
[18:21:51] <mistiry> came thru and then said no fuck you and turned back and hit again
[18:22:16] <PublicWiFi> damn!
[18:22:21] <PublicWiFi> "fuck you twice"
[18:22:24] <mistiry> yup
[18:22:30] <JollyRgrs> mistiry: wait, you sure that was charley?
[18:22:38] <mistiry> so we were hit by 4 storms, but hit 5 times
[18:22:40] <mistiry> 99% sure 
[18:22:55] <mistiry> but its been almost 20 years
[18:23:17] <JollyRgrs> ivan was the one that circled around
[18:23:28] <mistiry> ok so Ivan then
[18:23:30] <mistiry> whichever it was
[18:23:36] <mistiry> it turned back for round 2
[18:23:40] <JollyRgrs> but it hit far panhandle at first, then came down through miami
[18:24:00] <rpifan> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9xBAtCsCTQ
[18:24:00] <mistiry> Charley, or Ivan?
[18:24:04] <JollyRgrs> ivan
[18:24:07] <mistiry> oh ok
[18:24:14] <JollyRgrs> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Ivan
[18:24:24] <mistiry> Charley came up thru the gulf coast cuz it made landfall in a city i lived in for a bit
[18:24:30] <JollyRgrs> but we all know the spot of the eye isn't the only place affected
[18:24:38] <mistiry> especially not in a big storm
[18:24:55] <mistiry> and also the "bad" part of the rotation was what hit when it turned around

[18:25:25] <mistiry> i was on east coast so as it came up and made its turn we were right in it
[18:25:58] <mistiry> what a crazy year that was man
[18:26:49] <mistiry> during one of the storms i had to hop in the pool with a friend that was staying at our house, with one of those big plastic storage totes, and scoop out tons of water to stop it from flooding up into the house
[18:27:13] <mistiry> so imagine being in a pool during a hurricane
[18:27:14] <JollyRgrs> yeesh
[18:27:16] <JollyRgrs> yeah

[18:27:41] <JollyRgrs> lol
[18:27:44] <mistiry> it was like that. but also rain from above, and the sides.

[18:59:23] <vinrock> well im gonna go to texas for that one
[18:59:28] <mistiry> easy to forget how unique an experience it is
[18:59:40] <vinrock> i saw a rocket launch from kennedy space center when i was a kid

[19:00:12] <rpifan> the soviets did it better
[19:00:12] <mistiry> vinrock: yeah its really cool
[19:00:18] <rpifan> due to lack of funding they had to be more creativev

[19:01:00] <vinrock> they took off in the morning from the cape coral area

[19:03:25] <PublicWiFi> @Q​uantumFoam could argue this is the "natural" state of existence or some shit

[19:04:19] <rpifan> yall really need to watch that whole thing they did on space exploration on spitting image
[19:04:23] <vinrock> i dont thnk were meant to populate the cosmos

[19:04:30] <vinrock> our bodies cant handle the radiation
[19:04:35] <vinrock> we;re meant to create silicon life so it can

[19:04:45] <vinrock> i think so
[19:05:01] <PublicWiFi> without some limitations we would be so bored
[19:05:27] <rpifan> i do think a lot about that can life exist on a planet with unlimited resources
[19:05:28] <sintax> If i didn't have to work i could be fishing right now, wearing my loin cloth and relaxing. 
[19:05:32] <rpifan> or is it the constraints that create life
[19:05:35] <sintax> not spending 40+ hours a week in a cubicle.
[19:05:51] <mistiry> constraints drive innovation
[19:06:00] <vinrock> ugh cubicles
[19:06:03] <rpifan> well the latest research seems to point show that pre industrial pre agricurtural ppl actually worked like 30 hours a week
[19:06:08] <PublicWiFi> mistiry: ++
[19:06:11] <rpifan> so yes we'd be better off in a previous time
[19:06:20] <vinrock> being a caveman would be rad

[19:06:41] <PublicWiFi> and having tooth aches
[19:06:43] <PublicWiFi> ;P
[19:06:50] <mistiry> pre-agriculture people didnt so much "work" as they just survived
[19:06:54] <sintax> pfft only living to be 30
[19:06:54] <PublicWiFi> ^
[19:06:58] <rpifan> but thats not true
[19:07:01] <mistiry> cant really equate their experience with modern day living
[19:07:07] <PublicWiFi> the fact that we have the time to reflect and even have time to be "sad" means we've made it to teh next stage
[19:07:11] <rpifan> humans have mostly lived failry long lives 
[19:07:13] <PublicWiFi> survival is no longer the only concern of life
[19:07:15] <mistiry> pre-agriculture means huter-gatherer times
[19:07:15] <rpifan> the problem was infant mortality
[19:07:25] <mistiry> nobody was "working" they were "surviving"
[19:07:49] <mistiry> cant equate the hours spent hunting/gathering with sitting in a cube for 40 hours
[19:08:01] <mistiry> its like chewbacca living on endor, it doesnt make sense

[20:14:48] <lantech19446> whatever is happening is causing the modem to crash it'll stop reading http and https for 10-20 minutes which limits our traffic drastically but then it'll stop passing traffic to the outside world altogether

[20:15:11] <mistiry> HOw are you diagnosing that the modem is "crashing"?
[20:15:44] <mistiry> It should have a public IP address. Ping that, from inside and multiple outside sources. Record the data, use smokeping if you have to.
[20:16:04] <mistiry> The modem also has a gateway, its first hop. Set that up the same, ping from in and out./
[20:16:44] <mistiry> Come in late, hook up laptop, give it public IP, do similar tests. Test outbound connectivity on other ports (Test-NetConnection or curl or any number of tools). 
[20:17:01] <lantech19446> mistiry: the way i'm diagnosing it is by monitoring the modem itself and the internet beyond the modem

[20:30:05] <mistiry> idk it was making some god-awful screeching noises so i just unplugged it
[20:30:05] <lantech19446> mistiry: the entire reason i'm trying to reinvestigate my own gear is because they've been out twice first time they blamed it on us and left second time the guy tested the drop and the line in replaced the modem that was yesterday but it's still happening. now both times the morning the guy was supposed to come out comcast left a voicemail saying they had found a problem in the neighborhood and resolved it. So i 
[20:30:05] <lantech19446> don't know if it's us or a legitimate problem in the neighborhood
[20:30:50] <mistiry> But you've stated several times that you have confirmed the modem itself is the issue.
[20:32:04] <lantech19446> the modem is the top of the problem chain, i need to figure out if it's us causing the modem to have issues or the outside world because clearly its not just the modem
[20:32:37] <mistiry> So as I suggested, remove everything. Nothing connected to modem except the coax. Connect something, give it a public IP, and start testing.
[20:32:57] <mistiry> If its the modem, you will have the same issues, and can show it happening with none of your networking gear attached.
