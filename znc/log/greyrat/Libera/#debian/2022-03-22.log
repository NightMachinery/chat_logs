[01:12:42] <coralgoat> If I install Debian using the CD and am missing some of those packages can I intsall them from .deb packages without an internet connection.
[01:13:06] <coralgoat> So I get the package on an internet connected computer like https://packages.debian.org/buster/all/firmware-ath9k-htc/download
[01:13:24] <coralgoat> Move it over to the computer without an internet connection by USB.
[01:14:07] <coralgoat> Then install the deb package with apt while still not having an internet connection on the computer.
[01:14:28] <jmcnaught> coralgoat: yes, you can do that.  Another way if you have a phone is USB tethering to share the phone's wifi or data connection.

[01:15:40] <jmcnaught> If you will not have an Internet connection during installation then using a larger ISO image like DVD-1 will mean being able to install more packages vs. netinst which does not have many at all.

[01:23:26] *** Joins: foul_owl (~kerry@174-21-69-110.tukw.qwest.net)
[01:23:30] <coralgoat> The first is `ip` so I can do `ip link` or `ip address`.
[01:24:31] <coralgoat> The second is `iw` so I can do `iw <interface> scan` or `iw <interface> link`.
[01:25:05] <coralgoat> There are a lot of packages if I search for ip.
[01:25:07] <coralgoat> https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=ip&searchon=all&suite=buster&section=all
[01:26:43] <jmcnaught> coralgoat: search contents of packages instead, see the second search form on this page: https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages
[01:26:50] <jmcnaught> judd: file /bin/ip

[09:16:00] <WormFood> What is the name of the utility that will decompress like nearly every file out there? I have some ".lzh" (from a linux-like system) that I want to decompress, and I remember doing it before, under Debian, but I can't remember the name of the program. Anyone got an idea?
[09:17:13] <sussudio> !any ideas
[09:17:13] <dpkg> Yeah, I have an idea!  But I'll need a box full of string, a little WD-40, and 42 sex-crazed weasels.  And keep the KGB off my back for the next few hours!

[09:18:49] <sney> WormFood: the 7-zip utilities can handle a lot of different archives. maybe that's what you're thinking of
[09:19:02] <sney> but the native tool is probably better at it still ^
[09:20:04] <WormFood> I can get the source for the original program I used to compress this file 30 years ago. But I'm looking for a particular tool, I remember using in the past, that I know will handle this, but I want it for more than just this one task. And I can't remember the name of the program.

[15:06:15] <Khepra> teh resampling that alkisg suggested, is the only way to reduce the size, but makes it fuglier in the output

[15:10:33] <Eryn_FL> so i am trying to find out how/why there is not backport version of prometheus-node-exporter

[15:11:45] <alkisg> 👍️

[15:15:48] <Eryn_FL> hmmm
[15:16:18] <Khepra> Eryn_FL: I looked at checkbackport because of this:
[15:16:20] <Khepra> !ssb
[15:16:20] <dpkg> First, check for a backport on <debian-backports>.  If unavailable: 1) Add a deb-src line for sid (not a deb line!); ask me about <deb-src sid> 2) enable debian-backports (see <bdo>) 3) apt update; apt install build-essential; apt build-dep packagename 4) apt -b source packagename 5) dpkg -i packagename-ver.deb  To change compilation options, see <package recompile>; for versions newer than sid see <uupdate>.
[15:16:56] <Eryn_FL> ok..
[15:16:58] <Khepra> Eryn_FL: now... in my experience, some of teh dependency constraints given in sid/testing versions aren't hard requirements, meaning you could relax and change them into versions available in bullseye for the !ssb
[15:17:18] <Khepra> so it's entirely possible you could rework the src-deb to fit and build on bullseye. it's also entirely possible those deps are hard.
[15:17:41] <Eryn_FL> hmmm
[15:17:45] <Khepra> (relax = relax the dependency requirement)
[15:18:19] <Eryn_FL> well i think its just easier to grab the scripts and put them in saltstack and then use the salt module to install from github bypassing debs
[15:19:18] <Khepra> is there anything wrong or missing with the bullseye's version, that you need sid's ?

[16:41:26] <rockworld> https://www.javahelps.com/2017/10/install-apache-maven-on-linux.html
[16:42:44] <rockworld> problem is on debian, maven is not updated to latest version only with apt update so not sure what to do exactly
[16:42:58] <rockworld> with apt get sorry
[16:45:52] <Khepra> rockworld: perhaps just  `apt install maven` suffices? On Debian, packages are made self sufficient, in that they configure and set up everything, and start any services -- if possible, if it doesn't _require_ admin intervention.
[16:46:11] <jelly> rockworld, you have to create it yourself.  However, how many users are going to use maven on this machine?  If it's just one, you don't have to mess with global env. variables, just put them in your shell's rc files.

[20:28:27] <dtrterminus> hi, iam here with a bacula backup server and iam wondering which is the better method for offsite backup: two different pools with pitched backup jobs or one pool with copy jobs to another... any recommendations?
[20:29:32] <cheche> I just upgrade from debian10 to debian11, and the network is not working anymore. I can reboot and choose kernel 4.19 and the system is working again.  The network card is using module r8169

[20:58:51] <becks`> so the NTP server is now returning stratum 1, but there's still no asterisk in front of the NTP server... what's wrong? :-/  https://pastebin.com/raw/EWYjPuGr
[21:00:02] <kjetilho> becks`: too large offset
[21:00:21] <becks`> kjetilho isn't that 20 milliseconds?
[21:01:17] <cheche> jelly: I am going to bring back the unit to the lab and bring up the other 2 interfaces to see if breaks.
[21:01:38] <becks`> when running ntpdate, all looks good (I guess): 22 Mar 17:30:59 ntpdate[17172]: adjust time server 10.10.5.21 offset -0.025252 sec
[21:02:08] <kjetilho> becks`: oh sorry, you are right
[21:03:18] <kjetilho> becks`: oh, but reach is 1 - this is a bitmap, it means it has only reached it once
[21:03:38] <kjetilho> it will be 377 (0xff) when it has a stable connection.
[21:04:37] <becks`> probably because I just restarted ntp, it now shows 377: https://pastebin.com/raw/0mZgfahi
