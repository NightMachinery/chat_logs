[01:43:02] <Luke> hi, I'm not sure where else to ask this. I'm looking for a solution that will let me automate deployment of small & simple web apps (Flask etc). I'd like to include in the repository for each app, scripts to set up the app when it is first installed (initialise database, systemd unit, nginx config) that I can run each time the repository updates. I
[01:43:03] <Luke> deally I'd like to do it without containers, a lot of these just need a Python venv and a shared Nginx instance and I'd like to keep it simple if possible. At the moment the scripts are written in Ansible. 
[01:43:36] <Luke> Am I missing some tool that would let me achieve this more easily? There's a lot of messy glue to get Ansible to work in this way.
[01:46:39] <rawtaz> Luke: start from the other end - what actual product do you want to produce in the end (this depends on how you want to run it and where, of corse)?
[01:51:04] <Luke> I've got 5 or so in mind, some are completely static websites, some do a little templating on the backend with Flask. They all are going to run on either a Pi or a VPS. *How* is the big part, the tool I'm writing takes a GitHub link, clones the repo, executes the Ansible inside, and then starts a webhook to listen for pushes.

[01:53:18] <rawtaz> a pi or a vps? the ffs keep it simple, thats my advice :)
[01:53:40] <Luke> it isn't simple though, that's my point
[01:53:52] <Luke> okay it's simple, it's repetitive though
[01:54:54] <Luke> if I have 5 separate projects, I don't want to write the same systemd unit 5 times (with minor modifications), or the same nginx config. I want to tell my pi to fetch that app, and it runs that automatically

[01:55:34] <rawtaz> how is such an app run? i never used flask
[01:56:54] <Luke> with flask I'd typically install Gunicorn and point it at the python file, and then have an nginx reverse proxy for SSL. Gunicorn would be run as a systemd service
[02:01:34] <rawtaz> i mean
[02:01:46] <rawtaz> you already have a non-simple setup. so perhaps just wrap it in containers after all
[02:02:24] <rawtaz> or packer if it can produce something thats simpler to use for you
[02:03:02] <rawtaz> theres also Waypoint from hashicorp but im not sure it's what youre looking for eitehr :)
[02:04:32] <Luke> Waypoint looks interesting, thank you!
[02:05:04] <rawtaz> yw
[02:05:14] <rawtaz> surely others here have possibly better ideas than i do
[02:07:08] <Latrina> I can't sleep
[02:07:10] <Latrina> ffs
[02:08:14] <lantech19446> hey Latrina 
[02:09:37] <slaughter> Luke any reason you're not building your flask apps into static sites?

[02:11:43] <Latrina> hey lantech19446 
[02:11:50] <lantech19446> how ya doin today?
[02:12:02] <Dus10> rawtaz: what are you doing, if anything, to have your Terraform plan reviewed by people?
[02:12:23] <Dus10> I have a manual approval in my pipeline and I want someone to have some eyes on it
[02:13:03] <rawtaz> Dus10: im sorry, im not the right person to ask that :)
[02:13:09] <Dus10> so, the closest I have come so far is doing a `terraform show -json tfplan > tfplan.json`
[02:13:17] <slaughter> What pipeline Dus10 
[02:13:26] <Dus10> Azure Pipelines
[02:13:40] <Dus10> doesn't really matter which pipeline system, though
[02:13:44] <Dus10> I am just running commands
[02:14:05] <Dus10> I am tired of the dumb extensions... I moved everything to inline Bash
[02:14:37] <slaughter> Ah I was gonna say I bet there's an extension for that (there is) but more than fair to avoid
[02:15:54] <slaughter> tldr shows me `terraform plan -no-color > path/to/file` - but that doesn't solve your needing a way to look at it in the pipeline...maybe time for a slack hook or something similar?
[02:19:05] <Dus10> hmm, that might be fine...
[02:19:24] <Luke> slaughter: I might do that with some of them, but others need dynamic routes to talk to databases/APIs, so I don't want to rule them out of my solution
[02:20:06] <slaughter> Fair, I barely know anything about Flask other than the time I was charged with writing an article on how to generate static sites from it
[02:24:27] <Dus10> I guess I can use tee with that
[02:24:44] <Dus10> I might later move to Teams integration with it
[02:25:01] <Dus10> Because... Slack?  ewww
[02:25:56] <rawtaz> god damnit whats the point of creating a server when you dont get the mail with the actual root password >_<
[02:26:05] * rawtaz eyeballs hetzner vividly
[02:26:14] <slaughter> Dus10 did you just...that's a hot take if I've ever seen one
[02:26:46] <Dus10> I did, I kind of hate Slack a super ton
[02:26:59] <Dus10> Teams > Slack for 1 million years
[02:27:11] <Dus10> ...by a lot
[02:27:39] <Latrina> I don't mind slack at work
[02:27:48] <Latrina> I hate it for personal and non enterprise use
[02:28:10] <Dus10> I see more value for Teams with enterprise usage
[02:28:33] <Dus10> I can deal with Slack for personal stuff, actually
[02:28:34] <Latrina> however it seems to be the preferred communication platform by the cloud / devops eng
[02:28:42] <Dus10> especially when not sharing files
[02:28:48] <Latrina> Teams? Holy fuck!
[02:28:56] <slaughter> Teams is an atrocity
[02:29:02] <Dus10> yeah, everyone seems to hate it... but it is irrational
[02:29:08] <slaughter> I can understand not loving Slack, but actively rooting for Teams blows my mind
[02:29:11] <Latrina> irrational?
[02:29:13] <Dus10> an atrocity, by what logic?
[02:29:16] <Latrina> the thing is a fucking discrace 
[02:29:22] <Latrina> a batshit mess
[02:29:23] <rawtaz> Dus10: do you have any mac users?
[02:29:28] <Dus10> all platforms like it suck, actually
[02:29:37] <Dus10> but Teams is by far the best one
[02:29:46] <Dus10> and yes, including Mac users
[02:29:55] <Dus10> hell, I use it on my iPad and iPhone even
[02:29:57] <slaughter> Teams on mac in particular is an absolute atrocity
[02:29:57] <Dus10> way better
[02:29:57] * Latrina has done way too much coke. Can't see straight no more
[02:30:10] <Dus10> oh crap
[02:30:14] <Dus10> I drank too much
[02:30:20] <Dus10> it is time for class :)
[02:30:22] <slaughter> Everything about Teams seems like it's designed to prevent teams from working together easily
[02:30:25] <Latrina> :)
[02:30:27] <Dus10> should be more of a :D
[02:30:39] <slaughter> The only plus I can think of is that the calendar is built in
[02:30:51] <rawtaz> Dus10: i dont remember, where you studying or what class are you talking about?
[02:30:53] <Dus10> Slack doesn't seem like it is meant to actually facilitate anything at all
[02:31:02] <Dus10> rawtaz: I teach
[02:31:07] <rawtaz> subject?
[02:32:08] <Dus10> this semester, A+
[02:32:30] <slaughter> Inline threads, proper notifications, Integrations that don't suck, proper single pane view of your channels...been ~8 months since I used Teams but those stand out as things I'd give Slack poitns in over it
