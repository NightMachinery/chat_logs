[00:03:32] <Bco1981> emmeka: as far as i remember, there isn't much performance in that series. you would get a lot out of a more recent APU
[00:03:32] <MootPoot> its like doing performance mods on a house cat

[00:13:10] <Bco1981> emmeka: i agree on the gt1030, it's a fast way to get a boost out of your current setup.  but it's nvidia, you will have to deal with.
[00:13:23] <brainwash> that would be around 90 euros
[00:13:30] <MootPoot> just keep in mind if you buy a new system, even the igpu in the APU or newer intel cpu will outclass that gtx 1030
[00:13:42] <MootPoot> so this is a bandaid fix for another 2 or something years
[00:14:11] <emmeka> Bco1981 what sort of problems would it being Nvidia pose
[00:14:20] <MootPoot> gt 1030s are usually used for like office computers where you need more then 1 monitor or HTPCs
[00:14:34] <emmeka> MootPoot well, that was my notion with just replacing the APU. But if you're telling me I'd need to basically gut it to do so, then...
[00:14:53] <emmeka> my PC is basically an HTPC that also runs IRC
[00:14:59] <MootPoot> Nvidia drivers for linux aren't the best afaik..I cant speak for the truth of that, havent tried too much
[00:15:00] <Bco1981> emmeka: amigo might be better to answer that, i don't use linux much. especially not for gamming.

[00:15:15] <MootPoot> he runs a intel IGPU
[00:16:07] <Bco1981> true. i only know i haven't had 100% success in installing the nvidia driver on a linux. then usually gave up on linux.
[00:16:09] <MootPoot> but anyway, with this 1030, running 2 monitors, maybe YT on the left and a 2d game or something on the right and doing all your 2d VNs should be fine
[00:16:34] <MootPoot> idk about the linux part, I know it works and people do it with regularity, but as for how troublesome it is, i just dont know
[00:16:35] <emmeka> it'd just be for 1 monitor, though
[00:16:53] <MootPoot> yeah, the point is, you CAN have 2 if you want
[00:16:55] <MootPoot> but 1 is ok too

[00:36:59] <MootPoot> imma be honest
[00:37:02] <MootPoot> userbenchmark is a joke
[00:37:08] <MootPoot> I hate it when people use that site
[00:37:30] <emmeka> sooo why are there so many different manufacturers of the RX 550, and which ones are good
[00:37:38] <brainwash> so, the 5600G is slightly faster than a RX550
[00:37:59] <MootPoot> the prices are inaccurate, the performance tests are not uniform, and people take paper numbers and recite that like gosepel
[00:38:05] <Bco1981> yes, that matches userbenchmark numbers
[00:38:14] <MootPoot> emmeka:  think of it like this
[00:38:47] <MootPoot> Ford makes a car. Ford sells cars. However plenty of people decide, no, we want the henessey performance verson of f150 or something or other
[00:39:03] <MootPoot> except now the henessey performance version is the one most people buy
[00:39:31] <brainwash> my favorite would be Sapphire, but no idea if those are available or affordable
[00:39:39] <Bco1981> MootPoot: my own tests through out the years with various hardware matches the test numbers they have.. and it's not a hard cut "THIS IS IT" numbers... it's a guideline.
[00:39:58] <MootPoot> likewise, nvidia and AMD just make the software drivers, and the actual GPU core. Everything else ( fans, board, design etc ) are handled by the partner companies
[00:40:01] <Bco1981> and always take it with a grain of salt
[00:41:04] <MootPoot> I've heard too many "my gpu has a 20% faster clock then X other gpu so its 20% faster" or "my gpu has a 16% faster fill rate so its better then Y released like 5 years later and is a much better card"
[00:41:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Except clock speed isn't everything. I have a high-clock i7 from an old generation and a newer gen i7 with a slower clock.
[00:41:49] <MootPoot> that was my point
[00:41:53] <Bco1981> well it's stupid to single out one category, the won't show the full picture.
[00:41:53] <MootPoot> but yes, people think that

[01:06:23] <MootPoot> I mean, isen't that what happens with most open source efforts
[01:06:39] <MootPoot> it needs industry sponsers and money to work

[01:06:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *shitty
[01:06:57] <MootPoot> isen't the linux foundation funded by private companies
[01:07:05] <MootPoot> last I checked
[01:07:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You're conflating way too many things.
[01:07:19] <MootPoot> idk too much about it
[01:07:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For example, the Linux Foundation doesn't maintain a secret mailing list and secret documentation unavailable to Free contributors.
[01:07:32] <MootPoot> lol
[01:07:37] <MootPoot> the RISC V people do that?
[01:07:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yes
[01:07:47] <MootPoot> its not open source then is it
[01:08:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It technically is, but its development isn't really.
[01:08:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And the thing is... the core instruction set is open. But you can't make a functional CPU/GPU/whatever with just the ISA>
[01:08:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You need supporting infrastructure and the docs for that.
[01:09:27] <kyonko`> _who_ is RISCV?
[01:10:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> kyonko`: RISCV is a separate CPU instruction set & associated architecture. A bit like x86_64 is different from ARM64
[01:10:20] <klaxa> i just want apple to open-source the M1 and subsequent CPUs :^)
[01:10:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The development of things related to RISC-V is headed by the RISC-V Foundation.
[01:10:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The ISA isn't the problem. The Foundation are.
[01:10:40] <klaxa> and arm to waiver all rights as well and donate it to open source
[01:10:49] <MootPoot> I thought risc V was the future for mobile computing 
[01:10:57] <MootPoot> And low power devices 
[01:10:58] <klaxa> it was
[01:11:01] <klaxa> until it wasn't anymore
[01:11:02] <MootPoot> I guess arm64 it is 
[01:11:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: It still might be, as it is pretty power-efficient.
[01:11:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They're just pro-corpo assholes.
[01:11:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Same for ARM, really.
[01:11:25] <kyonko`> they want it for surveillance capitalism internet of things
[01:11:31] <MootPoot> Lol
[01:11:36] <klaxa> google is looking into building their own arm chips for their devices as well
[01:11:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So most devices might well switch to RISC-V and ARM anyway, but for Free development both are kinda crap.
[01:11:56] <kyonko`> i had to open and close the lid of my chromebook many times over a period of days to fully discharge the battery
[01:12:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> NDAs are a hard-stop nope for Free development. And both of those essentially require them.
[01:12:18] <klaxa> my chromebook's charge circuit broke after a year
[01:12:19] <MootPoot> I guess I own a ARM laptop anyway 
[01:12:25] <klaxa> i didn't run chromeos anyway
[01:12:41] <klaxa> it was sort of a pain to use though tbh
[01:12:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The main sad thing with Power9 is that the few ones that are available freely are... expensive.
[01:12:47] <klaxa> but it worked for the most part
[01:12:56] <kyonko`> expensive for the right people

[01:15:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Essentially.
[01:15:02] <kyonko`> and why would an animator choose a raptor over a mac
[01:15:28] <kyonko`> there is a bad rap that apple could take ownership of your mac produced animation

[01:29:01] <MootPoot> DM ofc
[01:29:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you go DM-SMR, at least ensure it's one of the types that supports TRIM. Which I think atm is basically... WD-only.

[02:04:01] <snake> MootPoot, 3d printers are dumb
[02:04:37] <snake> you can make some doodads that will have no use except to be set aside, added to a collection of other useless doodads, perhaps in a box or even on your shelf
[02:04:47] <snake> also plastic bad
[02:05:17] <MootPoot> I guess if all you cared about is making random little plastic art
[02:05:20] <MootPoot> sure
[02:05:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: I see you've never built custom bits of hardware to fix things for which replacements or repairs are unavailable because the company doesn't exist anymore or you're expected to buy a whole new item instead of just repairing it.
[02:05:24] <MootPoot> ^
[02:05:32] <Bco1981> i would like to use a 3d printer to make seperate my pc into two air chambers. instead of the cardboard i have now.
[02:05:42] <MootPoot> much less material wasted if you want to make a custom part for something
[02:05:54] <MootPoot> or a custom frame etc, you only need the printer and basic tools
[02:05:59] <MootPoot> rather then an entire fab shop
[02:06:11] <snake> Aurora_v_kosmose, sure but if you have to buy an entire 3d printer and the plastic for it just to replace a part, you should consider using someone else's 3d printer

[02:06:39] <MootPoot> lol
[02:06:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: That both requires knowing someone who has one and being able to get there and back quickly & safely (the pandemic kinda undoes that last one).
[02:07:04] <MootPoot> and also them letting you use theirs for like a week
[02:07:08] <MootPoot> for all the tries and settings
[02:07:11] <snake> im not convinced
[02:07:24] <snake> a 3d printer is something i think we could all regret having
[02:07:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For the projects I have in mind a CNC would be more practical for me, but I can afford neither so for the time being it's hand tools only.
[02:07:49] <snake> Aurora_v_kosmose, you could use someone else's cnc
[02:08:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: Almost the same issue as with a 3D printer applies, both the points I raised and MootPoot's.
[02:08:21] <snake> tho i imagine less DIYers have a cnc compared to 3d printer
[02:08:34] <MootPoot> I like how your solution to "3d printers are dumb " is to use somebody elses 3d printer / cnc
[02:08:35] <MootPoot> lol
[02:08:38] <snake> Aurora_v_kosmose, that's just your attitude
[02:09:01] <snake> you could find someone who has one, perhaps via craigslist or asking the newspaper or something?
[02:09:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: No, it's not. How do I magically find trustworthy people living within walking distance?
[02:09:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Classified ads don't give you the trust part.
[02:09:41] <MootPoot> also, this is exclduing if you use like a 3d printing or CNC service for any decent amount of parts
[02:09:50] <MootPoot> you're going to easily spend more then buying the thing yourself
[02:09:53] <snake> MootPoot, what parts are you making?
[02:10:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For me, it'd be custom rigging for electronic parts because even used enterprise stuff is stupidly expensive.
[02:10:22] <MootPoot> small frames, plastic doodads, mounts for some of my pc parts, etc
[02:10:34] <S_T_A_N> It's so fucking strange to have actually good anime to watch again

[02:11:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Why do we still live?
[02:11:02] <snake> hmm, well it doesn't take up space
[02:11:14] <MootPoot> you dont need money to live, just be homeless
[02:11:29] <snake> i enjoy living and living in a home
[02:11:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Need is a bad qualifier once one comes to the conclusion life has no inherent value beyond what you give it.
[02:11:39] <snake> i dont enjoy buyer's remorse for gimmicky things
[02:11:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> At which point you live because you want to, even if it's needless
[02:11:59] <MootPoot> gimmiky is pretty subjective
[02:12:13] <snake> perhaps
[02:12:18] <MootPoot> a good dslr is gimmicky for most of us, but for some people its a mandatory work tool
[02:12:21] <MootPoot> etc
[02:12:32] <MootPoot> having more then rice and potatos to eat is gimmicky 
[02:12:37] <MootPoot> in terms of variety
[02:12:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Borrowing a CNC or a 3D printer also works a lot better if you live in a large city with hacklabs.
[02:12:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you don't... good luck have fun.
[02:12:47] <MootPoot> you can live off of rice, potatos and some vitamin pills
[02:12:53] <MootPoot> why do you buy other food
[02:12:56] <MootPoot> it just takes up space
[02:12:59] <MootPoot> taste is a gimmick
[02:13:04] <MootPoot> drink soylent all day
[02:13:19] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: I do live within like an hour of one, but the pandemic fucked it
[02:13:35] <MootPoot> my uni also has a few, but the same problem
[02:13:42] <snake> MootPoot, i usually feel buyer's remorse when i buy soylent, not when i buy normal food
[02:13:54] <MootPoot> literally I'll spend more just driving up and down then just getting my own small unit
[02:14:44] <MootPoot> snake: if you feel buyers remorse about a 3d printer ( or think you will ) and we wont, I dont see why you're trying to use that to stick the gimmicky label on 3d printers
[02:14:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Pandemic kinda fucked up a lot of things. :/
[02:14:54] <MootPoot> its literally just your own priorities
[02:15:16] <MootPoot> you might call my GPU a gimmick but to me its on of the best purchases I've ever made 
[02:15:26] <MootPoot> 0 regrets, would do again every time
[02:15:31] <snake> what are you 3d printing for your gpu?
[02:15:44] <MootPoot> wat
[02:15:52] <snake> oh maybe gpu is not relevant
[02:16:08] <snake> why'd you even bring that up lol
[02:16:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: Different examples. Their point was that a GPU is a gimmick to someone who doesn't use one at all nor need one.
[02:16:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: Since presumably they do graphics/modeling/gaming, they do use it.
[02:16:27] <snake> Aurora_v_kosmose, yeah it could be
[02:16:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Although software-decoding full-HD video without a recent iGPU or a discrete GPU is also a pain.
[02:17:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> t. Someone who used an old thinkpad for a while.
[02:17:32] <snake> i had a thinkpad a while ago, it had some bugs but otherwise was ok
[02:17:41] <snake> i kinda miss it, but i dont miss the audio bugs
[02:18:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> At some point I started using external USB interfaces and mixers so I no longer noticed those.
[02:18:15] <snake> o
[02:18:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Even USB2 is more than fast enough for audio, so it works pretty well.
[02:19:33] <snake> you could 3d print your own butt plug
[02:19:44] <snake> might hurt tho
[02:19:58] <MootPoot> I might 3d print a few magazines 
[02:19:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I wouldn't recommend it. Most of the plastics for 3D-printing aren't body/food safe.
[02:20:01] <MootPoot> new ones are $$$$$$$
[02:20:05] <snake> o
[02:20:07] <MootPoot> and hard to get
[02:20:11] <MootPoot> if I get the dimensions right
[02:20:18] <MootPoot> I'll save a few hundred bucks
[02:20:25] <snake> oh you guys are 3d printing firearms
[02:20:33] <snake> and firearm accessories
[02:20:36] <snake> interesting
[02:20:52] <snake> MootPoot, wont the 3d printer cost a few hundred bucks
[02:20:52] <MootPoot> well, ofc I wont do certain prohib ones
[02:20:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I've looked into it, and CNC is the way to go for the actual machine itself. Accessories is a lot more lenient.
[02:21:11] <MootPoot> but just getting certain rarer model ones is so hard
[02:21:14] <MootPoot> these days
[02:21:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Well, mostly barrel & lower-receiver.
[02:21:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The rest can be plastic just fine.
[02:21:31] <MootPoot> all my boomsticks are legal
[02:21:34] <snake> i saw an 80% ar lower receiver "paper weight" online before
[02:21:50] <MootPoot> its just that the supply lines for certain rarer brands and calibers is nonexistant
[02:21:56] <snake> you just mill out the middle of it and boom, its a weapon
[02:22:04] <MootPoot> I've been waiting on a backorder for 3 magazines for like 4 months
[02:22:52] <snake> i can never empty my rectum fully usually so i've stopped using a butt plug, it's too messy
[02:23:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: yikes
[02:23:29] <snake> MootPoot, oic
[02:23:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's some pretty awful delay.
[02:24:19] <MootPoot> just 5 round mags but like
[02:24:33] <MootPoot> they are 60-70 dollars each for a little plastic box
[02:26:14] <MootPoot> people are successfully printing glock mags and having them working on YT
[02:26:21] <MootPoot> just buy the metal spring and thats it
[02:26:30] <MootPoot> a new one is 40 bucks
[02:26:53] <MootPoot> they made a new one for like maybe 5 bucks worth of plastic and a 1 dollar spring
[02:26:57] <MootPoot> sure it might not last AS logn 
[02:26:59] <MootPoot> but still
[02:27:12] <MootPoot> you can keep reusing the plastic
[02:32:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yep
[02:32:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And that also doesn't include shipping cost
[02:33:19] <MootPoot> for rarer parts its a godsend
[02:33:33] <MootPoot> especially rarer calibers
[02:33:39] <snake> i thought plastic couldn't be reused like that? like typically plastics that get recycled get downcycled into something like carpet

[02:34:06] <MootPoot> snake:  by reusing the plastic I mean simply heating it a bit
[02:34:13] <MootPoot> and pushing it back into shape
[02:34:18] <MootPoot> for the bent/warped parts
[02:35:36] <MootPoot> I also have a 3018 CNC that I can upgrade to mill alumiunum

[12:13:37] <brainwash> right now I'd say sonny boy cuz it's more recent
[12:13:57] <DunceCotus> vivy seems more like a conventional anime
[12:14:00] <amigojapan> Being recent does not make something good
[12:14:22] <brainwash> but it makes it more present in my head

[12:14:33] <amigojapan> Ok brainwash 
[12:15:09] <Cryowolf> I haven't finished Sonny Boy but it's weird, really weird and to me, not that good. Characters don't act in a realistic manner one bit and actions or events that just took place seem to 5 miutes later be forgotten as if it never happened
[12:15:15] <S_T_A_N> DunceCotus, so I was also not really into the concept of Vivy, but was coerced into watching it all anyway. I don't regret it. you might like it more than you think
[12:15:37] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it is not isekai if that is what you mean by conventional
[12:16:31] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: Sonny Boy isn't perfect but overall I feel it was one of the freshest new animes I've seen since maybe Deca-Dence (I don't watch that many animes tho)
[12:16:47] <brainwash> vivy is an original too
[12:16:48] <DunceCotus> S_T_A_N: ah ok.. I'll try to stay the course then
[12:16:49] <brainwash> !!
[12:17:11] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: I have binged it up to episode 12
[12:17:51] <DunceCotus> I feel like the setting is hampered by it being in the future.. but also in some kind of theme park?
[12:17:59] <DunceCotus> im sure it's all explained
[12:18:16] <S_T_A_N> If that's your hesitation, keep watching. 
[12:18:17] <Cryowolf> DunceCotus, fresh doesn't make something good and neither does trying something new. It's an arthouse project in my eyes with a very niche audience
[12:18:24] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: they go many places
[12:18:50] <Cryowolf> what does vivy stand for, if anything?
[12:19:09] <brainwash> sentient robots?
[12:19:10] <S_T_A_N> Part of my hesitation is that it could not possibly deliver something worthwhile with the scale required of the setup. But it did manage that very well
[12:19:12] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: it is arthouse but that doesn't make it bad, and yes it does seem amnesiac but that fits into its more metaphorical narrative
[12:19:14] <S_T_A_N> Cryowolf, it's a name
[12:20:15] <brainwash> it's not arthouse..... it's madhouse! :D
[12:20:45] <DunceCotus> I feel like I'll need to rewatch it, cause it does sometimes explain what happens to characters or with events, albeit in the background
[12:21:18] <DunceCotus> its not arthouse, its art attack!
[12:23:27] <Cryowolf> DunceCotus, that just seems like an excuse for it to do what it wants for the moment and be convoluted. None of that makes it good to me. I've tried to like it, but they don't even make an attempt at anchoring you to the world and keep changing the rules of the world. When an author can't keep up with their own established world rules and forget them or abandon them after a short while with no in-world explanation. That takes me out of 
[12:23:27] <Cryowolf> it. It seems convoluted for the sake of convolution and like the writer hadn't prepared anything and is making shit up as he/she goes
[12:25:31] *** Quits: sikel (~sikel@user/sikel) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[12:25:52] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: the entire point is there is multiple worlds with different rules
[12:25:59] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: this ties into the theme of the series
[12:26:38] <DunceCotus> yes its convoluted but I think it does explain the worlds and their rules adequately 
[12:32:59] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: what does whole milk mean? Does it mean it is the kind of milk that lactose intolerant people can't drink?
[12:33:35] <DunceCotus> full cream I suspect?
[12:34:24] <amigojapan> Ok DunceCotus but can lactose free milk also be whole milk?
[12:34:36] <DunceCotus> no
[12:34:54] <amigojapan> Ah ok. Then they sell real milk in Japan
[12:34:55] <DunceCotus> only partial milk
[12:36:13] <Cryowolf> DunceCotus, they don't explain when they switch worlds anymore, they don't explain new rules or the overall connection of rules. They don't explain how somebody all of a sudden has a steamboat and takes off. It's like being fucked on shrooms and high on weed and trying to follow a complex story and what your brain is processing is what has ended up in Sonny Boy
[12:37:42] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, I don't know what whole milk is
[12:38:11] <amigojapan> Alright Cryowolf 
[12:39:31] <Cryowolf> Sonny Boy started off interesting but then went into the direction of "I'll just write what I feel like at the moment" kind of story telling. Which is kinda typical of arthouse. And what makes it a very niche anime
[12:40:40] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: they do explain the rules.. sometimes explicitly, sometimes implicitly
[12:40:58] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: as for the boat, well Radjani builds it, that's his power
[12:41:11] <DunceCotus> real-life digital objects
[12:42:04] <amigojapan> Arthouse is the studio?
[12:42:08] <Cryowolf> they're doing a poor job at explaining things and its pacing is off
[12:42:13] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, no it's a genre
[12:42:19] <amigojapan> Oh
[12:42:23] <DunceCotus> madhouse is the studio xD
[12:42:32] <DunceCotus> or maybe publisher, idk
[12:42:57] <amigojapan> I am not familiar with arthouse genre
[12:43:06] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: its the kind of series where if you are looking for a coherent explanation you're gonna be disappointed
[12:43:13] <DunceCotus> but it does still explain the rules I think
[12:43:36] <DunceCotus> the pacing is off yes
[12:43:59] <DunceCotus> but each episode is kinda self-contained even if it follows on chronologically
[12:45:18] <DunceCotus> I think for the ideas it explores and the way it explores them, its a great series, but yes narrative-wise its a mess
[12:45:25] <DunceCotus> I think its a beautiful mess tho
[12:45:28] <Cryowolf> cause the pacing is all over the place and I guess the writer wants to say that time moves differently in different worlds and different worlds contain different things and each different world is built on each person and each variant of that person (since there's a multiverse, there's more than one of everyone.) Different timelines created different worlds, by different people but nobody ages and while one world may have had an hour 
[12:45:28] <Cryowolf> pass, another maybe had 1000 years pass. But that's me putting my creative ideas into it
[12:45:47] <Cryowolf> that's me filling in the blanks using my own ideas
[12:45:56] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: that's pretty much how it works
[12:46:03] <DunceCotus> latter episodes go into this more
[12:46:21] <Cryowolf> but it doesn't feel like it's going anywhere
[12:46:44] <DunceCotus> that's also touched on
[12:46:49] <Cryowolf> so it really isn't all that appealing to me
[12:47:14] <DunceCotus> each to their own
[12:47:16] <Cryowolf> yeah but if something is touched on only after 8 or 9 episodes of a 12 episode season
[12:47:25] <Cryowolf> that's not my thing
[12:47:34] <Cryowolf> yep
[12:47:44] <DunceCotus> consider what they call the world jumps - "drift"
[12:51:29] <Cryowolf> so either they're in limbo. Or they're in a single persons head that's fractured into multiple personalities. Or they gained powers and reality shattered when their perception stopped being guided by the universe
[12:51:51] <Cryowolf> or something else
[12:52:03] <Cryowolf> I can go on and on with things I come up with
[12:52:10] <Cryowolf> but not anything they suggested
[12:53:20] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: its sorta explained throughout the show
[12:54:29] <DunceCotus> I think for an abstruse arthouse anime it actually does provide some solid answers
[12:54:42] <DunceCotus> its just spread out, and rarely spells them out
[12:55:05] <Cryowolf> at one point it's suggested they're dead, then it's suggested they can find a way back. But I keep going back to limbo and them being dead and unable to move on. One of them can see "the light" (heaven) and one can move between each persons personal limbo
[12:55:29] <Cryowolf> and one wants to kill God
[12:55:47] <DunceCotus> yeah but that's early days
[12:56:29] <DunceCotus> and not everything gets tied up neatly
[12:56:58] <DunceCotus> i'd have to rewatch to assess how well it does at tying things up
[12:57:35] <Cryowolf> which is why I said there's nothing in that universe that's a sustained fact. I dunno if it's an adaptation, but if it is...it seems to have skipped a shitload of stuff
[12:57:57] <DunceCotus> its an original series
[13:01:15] <Cryowolf> I dont believe in exposition through dialogue, it works sometimes in some genres. But not in mysteries. Though when a show does its best not to present you with the mystery to solve, but to keep shuffling the mystery away because they just came up with something new or thought "this would be artistic". It doesn't work for me. I can't deal with narratives, stories etc that doesn't have structure of some sort where I can piece things 
[13:01:15] <Cryowolf> together because it wanted to be artistic instead
[13:01:20] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: part of the theme of the series is that the rules of any world are often arbitrary at best, or control mechanisms at worst
[13:01:39] <DunceCotus> however we still have to navigate them, each time
[13:02:14] <DunceCotus> however there are some constants, like the students' powers stay the same throughout
[13:03:20] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: fair enough

[13:11:30] *** Joins: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm)
[13:13:20] <Cryowolf> I want a good mystery anime though, that presents you with clues (even breaking the 4th wall, I don't mind that if it's like a detective thing.) Since you can't possibly know everything they're seeing, as it's not always drawn. Being presented with it in proper context and then trying to solve the mystery before the protagonist does is fun
[13:13:32] <Cryowolf> but not a lot of shows do that, be it live-action or anime
[13:16:06] <Cryowolf> they set stuff up to be impossible and suddenly a super-genius solves it by coming up with something overly complex or convoluted. Or the mystery was hidden because we weren't shown the hints at all or know the in-universe rules of how things work (typical of shounen shows, regardless of rating.) I still find those entertaining, but it would be fun to try and solve it myself. Good thing there are Sherlock Holmes games
[13:17:11] <Cryowolf> they make them more complex as they go on as for how much interaction the player has in the world, regarding looking for evidence, writing down clues (or red-errings, or jibberish cause you thought a sewage pipe was significant for some reason)
[13:17:41] <Cryowolf> then being able to use any clue in a conversation with witnesses, suspects etc
[13:17:49] <Cryowolf> I love the Sherlock Holmes games
[13:19:23] <Cryowolf> in the older (3d world) ones you'd end up having to draw lines between clues, statements, people etc to form connections/deductions and solve it by making the right corrections. The thing is, you could make the wrong ones too and the story would continue, with you having failed that part
[13:19:29] <Cryowolf> or semi-failed
[13:28:30] <amigojapan> Cryowolf emmeka was saying he thinks vivy is a contender for anime of the year

[13:31:19] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: the first episode is really exciting
[13:31:39] <Cryowolf> something I've seen in western tv shows and movies 100 times. Someone goes back in time to stop a war, especially one by AI and robots
[13:31:42] <Cryowolf> like...Terminator

[13:35:26] <Cryowolf> not for a second
[13:35:48] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: do you like Steins;Gate?
[13:35:51] <DunceCotus> that has mystery elements
[13:35:56] <Cryowolf> if it told me it was only about a singing idol, I would go "nope"
[13:35:58] <DunceCotus> though not so much detective
[13:36:00] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it's a spoiler

[13:36:17] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: nuh uh
[13:36:44] <amigojapan> The first episode is very surprising, similar to madoka 3rd episode
[13:36:48] <Cryowolf> then there's that other time travel story by the same team that has a clumsy little girl
[13:37:20] <DunceCotus> Ms Fiddlesticks
[13:37:21] <Cryowolf> then I remember the time travel story with the serial killer

[13:52:39] <Cryowolf> that's an old movie? I don't like the 90s style of animation for the most part
[13:52:48] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: and stay 3 episodes

[13:55:31] <amigojapan> That's what it is but it is a spoiler, you are not supposed to know that
[13:57:45] <Cryowolf> that would be the issue then though. Being presented with one thing that is another. It would only work with people who 1) are already into magical girl or have a curious first watch, 2) People who know it's about something else, 3) people who've been told "trust me bro, there's a huge twist" and trust it

[14:34:55] <emmeka> amigojapan nice
[14:35:00] <Cryowolf> a computer simulation
[14:35:14] <Cryowolf> they can manipulate it or travel between simulations
[14:35:25] <brainwash> then it is in the same universe as The Matrix?
[14:35:27] <Cryowolf> which to them would be timelines
[14:35:34] <brainwash> and Star Wars too?
[14:35:36] <amigojapan> emmeka: I don't get why that guy dropped it in episode 6
[14:35:55] <emmeka> yeah that'd be a weird place to drop, the arc ep 6 ends on is stellar
[14:35:55] <Cryowolf> brainwash, if the matrix is a potentially infinite layer of realities with maybe no real world existing
[14:36:02] <emmeka> and is a cliffhanger
[14:36:20] <brainwash> maybe we can fit in Naruto too :)
[14:37:36] <Cryowolf> the thing with that world though is the use of technology to alter reality in some way. Or if you know the twist in Chaos;Head, a simulation would make that far more plausible
[14:37:50] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: what about realities where computers have not been invented yet, those world brake the infinity
[14:38:26] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, no cause they created the simulation to put people into it, not create npcs
[14:38:30] <Cryowolf> the people have memories
[14:38:39] <Cryowolf> and the wrld is already advanced
[14:39:03] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I thought you meant everything was a simulation inside a simulation
[14:39:26] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[14:40:07] <Cryowolf> yes...because they created the earth simulation to put people into it, because they feared the annihilation of humanity in 2038. Those in the simulation then began to fear the same thing and built the same machine
[14:40:12] <Shinra> I watched it in the pub as it happened brainwash yes
[14:40:15] <Shinra> it was kewl
[14:40:31] <Shinra> 2-2 is a fair result for the 2 best teams in the league
[14:40:45] <Cryowolf> and did the same thing in the simulation as in the "supposed" real world
[14:41:13] <amigojapan> I see Cryowolf 
[14:41:16] <Cryowolf> making those in the real world question if they are a simulation
[14:41:28] <Cryowolf> since if a simulation can make a simulation, they could be a simulation
[14:41:52] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: is this from the sequels?

[14:45:04] <emmeka> brainwash doesn't seem to just be a UK problem, I was reading about natgas shortages in France
[14:45:15] <Cryowolf> the countries that have and sell oil tend to sometimes hoard it and limit its sale to drive prices up before starting to sell a lot again at those prices
[14:45:44] <brainwash> similar to how China is hoarding microchips?
[14:45:52] <Cryowolf> and the prices wont drop back to the same as before. They'll drop a little bit, but not much

[14:51:35] <emmeka> Cryowolf well, a difference is that unlike the US, Chinese capitalists are actually reasonably committed to their country and its development
[14:51:50] <Cryowolf> cause there's always gonna be a country that's very poor and they don't want to go to Africa because exploiting black people for labour would be seen as very racist.

[14:54:39] <sscout> Cryowolf: that's why the contracts insist on technology transfer, because in 30 years they want China to *design* the next iPhone
[14:55:25] <Cryowolf> yeah but China is very bad at thinking long term, mostly due to all the famine and such before the economic growth that made "long term" a suicidal idea and focusing on the short term, such as "where do I get food today?" became more important and that mentality stuck
[14:55:34] <Cryowolf> it's slowly fading
[14:56:30] <Cryowolf> but typically they've been pretty poor at thinking of long term stuff. That's why many factories etc cheat their clients, end up with a short term large payout and are then never hired again and have to close
[14:56:48] <DunceCotus> the question is not where do we get food

[22:46:48] <Poeticode> a good way to not use it is to actually call/text your friends n fam, and make group chats elsewhere

[22:49:06] <Roey> btw I do actually have an idea of what "poeticide" does; it blots out creativity.
[22:49:21] <Roey> by killing poets.
[22:49:23] <Roey> I dunno.
[22:49:33] <Poeticode> hmm so it's absinthe?
[22:49:36] <Roey> LOL
[22:49:47] <Roey> who's the guy who loved absynthe tho it made him crazy.
[22:49:50] <Roey> hemmingway?
[22:50:08] <Roey> s/the guy/the writer
[22:50:27] <Poeticode> I like his Death in the Afternoon absinthe cocktail with a splash of passionfruit syrup
[22:50:49] <brainwash> !c absinthe
[22:50:50] <ImoutoBot> brainwash: Absinthe is an anise-flavoured spirit derived from several plants, including the flowers and leaves of Artemisia absinthium, together with green anise, sweet fennel, and other medicinal and culinary herbs. Historically described as a highly alcoholic spirit, it is 45–74% ABV or 90–148 proof US.
[22:50:53] <Poeticode> blanc absinthe; verde can be a bit too intense with the champaigne
[22:51:15] <brainwash> !c anise
[22:51:16] <ImoutoBot> brainwash: Anise, also called aniseed or rarely anix, is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae native to the eastern Mediterranean region and Southwest Asia.
[22:51:37] <brainwash> I have no idea what anise is
[22:52:12] <Poeticode> all i know is that it tastes like black licorice which is offputting to most people
[22:53:36] <brainwash> do you know ouzu?
[22:54:05] <brainwash> apparently, anise is used to make the Greek ouzu
[22:54:58] <Poeticode> whoa :0 
[22:55:03] <Poeticode> !g ouzu

[22:55:50] <brainwash> to me it looks like Greek vodka
[22:56:15] <brainwash> and absinthe is probably the French vodka
[22:56:19] <brainwash> ?!
[22:56:20] <Poeticode> interesting i've had sambuca a few times. Wouldn't have expected that to also be anise
