[01:09:22] <saturn2> you would probably need to open about:blank in all but a few of your windows for it to do anything noticeable
[01:09:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because I had 641 and then I opened another tab

[01:11:56] <galambo__> just curious why do you want to unload the active tab?
[01:12:22] <galambo__> arent you expected to be using the active tab?
[01:12:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh because otherwise I have 146 tabs that will never be unloaded, lol
[01:12:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo__: The active tab *in windows other than the front one*
[01:12:54] <galambo__> wait why do you have 146 windows?
[01:12:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[01:13:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> You see this is what I always run into when people recommend tab management "solutions"
[01:13:26] <saturn2> because he clicked on "new window" 145 times
[01:13:27] <galambo__> I always force firefox to use one window
[01:13:37] <galambo__> whats the point of doing that?
[01:13:57] <phill> I do it to organize my tabs

[01:15:28] <galambo__> anyways to each their own
[01:15:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo__: Those of us who use non-shitty operating systems find window management very easy and useful

[01:20:07] <catern> (firefox tabs I mean, not OS tabs)
[01:20:35] <galambo__> catern, for starters you can use an extension like dormancy to unload tabs
[01:20:52] <galambo__> I like having a nested tree of side tabs
[01:20:56] <catern> i'm asking Obormot here mostly ( Obormot do use dormancy)
[01:20:58] <catern> do you*
[01:21:04] <galambo__> so I have context
[01:21:10] <catern> galambo__: btw your OS can unload unused processes too
[01:21:26] <catern> it's called "paging"
[01:21:35] <galambo__> catern, yes but firefox does not use a separate process for each tab
[01:21:42] <saturn2> galambo__: just to take the most obvious aspect, the concept of organizing all the information you need to work with in a ui designed to resemble an endless collection of "tabs" in an infinitely wide three-ring binder (or something?)
[01:21:56] <saturn2> it's patently absurd
[01:22:23] <galambo__> saturn2, ok how would you improve it?
[01:22:39] <catern> galambo__: have you ever used a tiling window manager?
[01:23:09] <catern> (if you haven't, then you haven't done enough background research to ask that question)
[01:23:17] <galambo__> catern, no what am I missing out on?
[01:23:23] <catern> try it andn see
[01:23:41] <galambo__> also can I use one in windows? I dont think i3 is compatible with windows
[01:23:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Half the conversation over the past three hours has been me trying Dormancy, concluding that Dormancy sucks and doesn't do anything useful for me, and uninstalling Dormancy

[01:24:26] <catern> galambo__: lol no
[01:24:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Anyway as I said before, I have 642 tabs in 146 windows in Firefox
[01:24:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Some of the windows are minimized.
[01:24:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe 20-30 of them

[01:25:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> lame, but also I already maximize all my windows
[01:25:32] <galambo__> and then I go to work and I can barely open a couple of windows because the computers are so slow

[01:26:05] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: is the window menu how you get to something you used 50-windows-ago?
[01:26:11] <kuudes> catern, tiling window manager things seem to talk about dividing the screen to multiple applications
[01:26:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Mostly the last, for that
[01:26:33] <kuudes> I mean, no windows. just switching between apps
[01:26:37] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: ah, go to tab works across windows? yes I imagine that one is critical for that use, definitely what I would use

[01:27:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Yes it works across windows, it's very nice
[01:27:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: (hat tip to mst for teaching me the % trick for that)
[01:28:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> (er, the % trick is not for making it work across windows, it does that anyway; the % trick is for limiting search to *only* open tabs and not history, bookmarks, etc.)
[01:29:16] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: the window menu is just a recency-ordered menu that you can scroll down, I'm guessing?
[01:29:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is sadly a case where Chrome is way ahead, it's got QuickTabs and Session Buddy, I really miss those extensions)
[01:30:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: The Window menu is a standard macOS feature, and yes I believe it's recency-ordered by default (not super sure though)
[01:30:19] <galambo__> kuudes, I think there is some merit in like getting to know what enthusiasts/nerds use. for example I was scouring 'ultralight hiking' forums and I actually found some good recommendations for things I could use in my everyday life
[01:30:32] <catern> (it doesn't really sound like you're getting much advantages from the macos window manager, this is stuff which Windows or XFCE etc have too)
[01:30:50] <catern> (the go to tab feature is killer but that's a Firefox feature)
[01:32:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: No, you don't understand: the Window menu is *only windows in the current application*
[01:33:04] <catern> no, I get that
[01:33:08] <catern> Windows has that
[01:33:27] <catern> (at least Windows 10 - and admittedly I don't know how it scales to 100 windows)
[01:34:02] <catern> I assume XFCE et al have that too just by cloning, although it's been a long time since I used a non-tiling-WM
[01:34:10] <galambo__> yes we do have that feature in windows
[01:34:23] *** galambo__ is now known as galambo
[01:34:37] <catern> galambo: silence windows user! it was not meant as praise for windows, which is still trash
[01:34:47] <catern> instead it was meant as MacOS bashing I guess
[01:35:20] <galambo> catern, I think they are all alike now I dont really care
[01:35:36] <galambo> I dont remember the last time windows crashed on me or gave me trouble
[01:35:52] <galambo> I am familiar with the os and can do what I want
[01:36:03] <galambo> I have all the applications I need
[01:36:07] <galambo> windows is invisible to me
[01:36:46] <galambo> it just works (tm)
[01:39:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Windows only just works for people who don't have advanced workflows
[01:39:40] <catern> good for you, but when I said "silence windows user" I didn't really want your inane ramblings on how happy you are with windows
[01:40:27] <kuudes> that seems a tad impolite
[01:41:17] <catern> i'm channeling the '00s
[01:42:14] <galambo> catern, thats of course because linux was the best and most usable OS back in the '00s
[01:42:48] <galambo> you use windows? you are not as masochist as I am. I use linux
[01:43:13] <galambo> thats like 'you use toyota? thats so boring! I drive a 1990s alfa romeo'

[01:59:49] <pompolic> catern, i disagree, actually
[01:59:56] <pompolic> paging is transparent to the user
[02:00:20] <pompolic> a paged out process is loaded back from storage transparently (on linux it goes to disk sleep)
[02:00:38] <pompolic> suspended processes need to be explicitly resumed (and then they may be paged back in from storage)
[02:01:11] <pompolic> and the OS memory manager sometimes gets insane ideas
[02:02:28] <pompolic> although i guess what i'm suggesting is to write something that makes the suspend/resume transparent

[02:27:12] <galambo> from the article: Interestingly, at the time of writing, I bonds happen to have a 0% fixed rate and a 7.12% variable inflation rate, for a nominal annualized return of 7.12% and a real return (return adjusted for inflation) of zero. Understand though that this may still generate a positive real return for you if your own personal inflation is not as high as the broad CPI-U metric. For example, if you don‚Äôt need to buy a car anytime soon (or if yo
[02:27:12] <galambo> u don‚Äôt drive at all) and you generate your own electricity via solar panels, your personal inflation rate should be reliably lower than the CPI-U measurement, of which energy services, fuel/oil, and vehicles are currently the primary contributors.
[02:27:12] <galambo> This 7.12% is the highest variable rate ever paid since I bonds were first introduced in 1998. Not even risky junk bonds are paying this much!

[07:08:40] <ardent[m]> I mean a big enough company has a culture that averages out to typical for its hiring process, so small changes make the ship more likely to stay what's worthy of the name Theseus
[07:08:49] <PapuaHardyNet> do programmers really want to coast more? That's... strange for me. Maybe I'm surrounded by people who are stupidly ambitious?
[07:09:03] <PapuaHardyNet> or maybe I simply ignore the existence of people who aren't ambitious enough
[07:09:24] <ardent[m]> an individual experiences way more change than a company does when a person leaves, so it makes sense that the person has more risk to offset, and thus the premium goes from them
[07:09:29] <gwern> programmers love coasting because they hate navigating people stuff like hiring and job aplication and figuring out somewhere new. hence google filling up with deadwood

[07:10:29] <PapuaHardyNet> based on ardent's theory, startups should take a much lower stability premium in comparison to huge companies.
[07:10:41] <ardent[m]> I would predict that under this model, yes
[07:10:49] <ardent[m]> that startups have more raises in particular
[07:10:58] <PapuaHardyNet> but I agree with gwern - the people skills and the friction inherent to it is what allows companies to collect stability premiums
[07:11:21] <gwern> big companies provide a valuable service that way. people don't want to be self-entrepreneurs. they hate it!
[07:11:35] <gwern> lifetime employment and the golden watch
[07:12:05] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. makes sense

[22:17:17] <kuudes> sure, but doesn't the ocean freeze there?
[22:17:20] <ggreer> no
[22:17:22] <kuudes> oh
[22:17:39] <ggreer> you'd have to go *way* north for that. not even anchorage freezes in the winter
[22:17:46] <kuudes> oh
[22:17:50] <kuudes> here it is normal
[22:18:49] <ggreer> but cross the cascade range and it's cold and snowy in the winters. it's funny how you can drive 30 minutes from portland or seattle and be in a winter wonderland

[22:39:24] <pompolic> specifically
[22:39:45] <pompolic> i am also perplexed by the train of thought that generated this strategy
[22:40:37] <pompolic> "don't have a gathering" is reasonable. "since you have a gathering, optimize for gathering related goals (say, guests' comfort), while also minimizing covid spread" is also reasonable
[22:40:43] <pompolic> risk budgets etc etc
[22:40:59] <pompolic> it's the big brain utilitymaxing i guess
[22:41:04] <pompolic> but
[22:41:51] <pompolic> "have a gathering but otherwise optimize for minimizing covid" doesn't make sense to me, unless they are consciously only trying to minimize covid, while unconsciously they are also working towards standard human goals like socializing

[22:49:25] <kuudes> well, over here we still haven't had much covid
