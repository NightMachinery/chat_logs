[00:06:18] <edcragg> when i log in it keeps telling me "Invalid password" which i don't really get
[00:07:07] <edcragg> and now "reconnecting too fast", not sure if that's the znc flood thing or fail2ban
[00:08:25] <Casper> If ZNC is telling you that on connect, then it's most likely fail2ban. If *status is telling you that, it's the IRC server not liking it.
[00:10:16] <edcragg> hmm
[00:10:28] <edcragg> i'm really not sure what "invalid password" was referring to
[00:10:43] <edcragg> the guess is that this triggered fail2ban
[00:11:01] <edcragg> but it let me log on with an irc client initially
[00:11:20] <Casper> Might be easier to disable fail2ban until everything is working.
[00:11:31] <Casper> But if you're logged on with an IRC client; What's *status telling you? :p
[00:12:32] <edcragg> i tried to reconnect and as promptly banned :3
[00:14:01] <edcragg> where would bindhosts be ooi?
[00:14:33] <Casper> Not relevant until *status tells you it couldn't setup the bindhost. Does *status say anything?
[00:15:15] <edcragg> fail2ban is off and i'm still being banned so i guess it's the flood plugin
[00:15:26] <edcragg> one sec...
[00:15:46] <Casper> ZNC doesn't ban you if there's no modules to ban you.
[00:18:05] <edcragg> i turned off the system fail2ban, forgetting that there is a znc fail2ban module, too
[00:18:11] <edcragg> which was doing the banning
[00:18:20] <Casper> Heh

[01:30:16] <Casper> So I'm guessing ZNC just wants IPv6, but your IPv6 is broken and it can then simply not connect.
[01:30:44] <Casper> does 'ping -6 google.com' work? :p
[01:31:11] <MetaNova> /msg *status setuserbindhost 0.0.0.0
[01:31:23] <Casper> MetaNova, I already told him /znc bindhost 0.0.0.0 :p 
[01:31:31] <Casper> That's most likely why it works at the moment.
[01:31:33] <MetaNova> ah
[01:32:55] <edcragg> i think maybe ipv6 is disabled
[01:33:05] <Casper> So, ping -6 google.com also failed?
[01:33:15] <edcragg> indeed
[01:33:20] <Casper> You should ask vultr support what's going on with that I guess :p
[01:34:00] <Casper> Or dive into it yourself, but that's outside of the scope of #znc :D
[01:34:35] <edcragg> cheeky
[01:34:43] <edcragg> how did you know it was vultr?
[01:34:57] <Casper> Because you posted  (~ed_test@nom4.xyz)

[01:35:41] <edcragg> :)
[01:38:43] <edcragg> i don't see why ipv6 is the issue though
[01:38:47] <Casper> Also, when IPv6 works, I guess all your issues are gone. :p
[01:38:56] <Casper> Because IPv6 is normally preferred over IPv4.
[01:39:07] <Casper> And if your IPv6 is borked, yeah, it might be that you're not getting any connections through.
[01:39:14] <Casper> Or at least to servers that -have- IPv6.
[01:39:49] <edcragg> yeah

[11:07:53] <borbetomagus> i'm on two irc networks, libera and another one. i have znc set up for both, but znc won't connect to libera - i get a dns error. any ideas?
[11:08:15] <borbetomagus> the error is The operation couldn’t be completed. (kCFErrorDomainCFNetwork error 2.)

[12:14:09] <borbetomagus> I'm on a mac but the znc server is debian, and that is the full error message i get
[12:16:44] <borbetomagus> I think that's an OSX-specific error message though so in that case it's a problem between my irc client (limechat) and znc... which is very odd because it's perfectly capable of connecting to znc for the other network
