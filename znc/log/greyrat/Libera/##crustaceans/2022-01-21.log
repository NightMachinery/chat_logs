[00:04:11] *** kl1n3 is now known as kline
[00:15:58] <kline> my theory is that crypto is a symptom of energy being so cheap and available
[00:16:34] <kline> the cheaper and more available some resource gets, the more worthwhile it is to gamble against worse and worse odds to convert it to something more valuable
[00:17:19] <kline> if you have an infinite amount of something, its still worth gambling infinite amounts of it against infinitesimal odds for even a tiny payout
[00:19:06] <kline> my consequent worry is not about crypto, strictly, but that this is the pattern we see everywhere and we'll eventually deplete our reserves of energy (that only feels unlimited just now because its future-society's problem) and we'll have squandered what we need to get through to better using our routine energy income because we blew all our savings
[00:19:18] <kline> 2100 could be the century of our energy hangover
[00:19:52] <imode> have fun, future humans. I won't be having kids and my blood line will stop.
[00:20:31] <epilys> the curse ends with us
[00:20:42] <kline> step away from the big red button, epilys
[00:20:52] <imode> smash that nuke button
[00:21:05] <epilys> I'm not killing anyone but I'm not creating anyone either
[00:21:27] <imode> heh.
[00:21:36] <kline> i will be procreating at strictly sub-replacement
[00:21:43] <kline> (mostly because no wife)
[00:21:53] <kline> but yeah id have at-most 2 kids
[00:22:04] <epilys> I've lived a life of misery and my daily life is misery and angst, I don't wish that reality on other people
[00:22:15] <imode> damn.
[00:22:20] <kline> everyone could have two kids if they want, and it would be a smaller burden on the planet over time
[00:22:58] <epilys> excuse me if I'm being dramatic, but i'm just being honest
[00:23:15] <imode> I've lived a pretty good life but I can see life not being so good for the next 50 years.
[00:23:39] <epilys> oh yeah that too
[00:24:29] <edk> what's annoying is how simple it would be to change that if people wanted to
[00:24:44] <imode> I want to.
[00:24:56] <imode> need to kill off quite a few people and industry to do that, though.
[00:25:06] <edk> no you don't
[00:25:13] <edk> you just need other people to want to, too
[00:25:19] <imode> yeah that's not happening.
[00:25:25] <imode> ever.
[00:26:19] <imode> for some consequence X brought on by action Y by individual Z, some individual Q who never experiences X will continue to be blind to Y and thus apathetic towards Z.
[00:26:35] <edk> if, i dunno, 25% of people cared enough about the state of humanity and the world to make meaningful contributions to fixing it, we'd be set
[00:26:40] <edk> well yeah but the apathy exists at every level
[00:27:06] <edk> think of all the people on lobsters who don't like where we're heading but still work for faang
[00:27:10] <imode> you do realize that the thing that's stopping most of us from, I don't know, overthrowing the people that are doing this and locking them in a deep dark hole is... they have money, guns and popular opinion.
[00:27:17] <edk> still buy stuff on amazon
[00:27:19] <edk> no it isn't
[00:27:22] <edk> it's convenience
[00:27:31] <epilys> it's egoism.
[00:27:47] <epilys> why risk ruining my situation?
[00:28:16] <imode> we could reform literally every part of our world to be as energy efficient and environmentally friendly as we possibly could. you wanna know who doesn't want that? the people that shift the blame onto the people they profit from.
[00:28:37] <edk> we let them
[00:28:39] <imode> because that reform is expensive, costs time and people, which cost money.
[00:29:01] <imode> I don't "let" anybody do anything. if I didn't have a family to keep after I'd probably join a militia to hunt down billionaires.
[00:29:08] <edk> there will always be bezoses, rockefellers, ...hitlers
[00:29:35] <imode> why are you so quick to push the blame to the people in the markets these monsters have created.
[00:29:57] <gwozniak> Because we are part of it
[00:30:00] <epilys> imode, when/if you get to that militia, sign me up
[00:30:12] <imode> I don't consent to it. I don't wish to be a part of it. I am an involuntary participant.
[00:30:12] <gwozniak> Killing everyone in charge will solve nothing
[00:30:15] <edk> there are so many people that it's all but inevitable we will produce such specimens
[00:30:24] <imode> gwozniak: yeah, I don't buy that at all.
[00:30:37] <imode> if you have some preconceived notion that their lives are worth the same as ours, try asking them that.
[00:30:47] <gwozniak> Rest assured that burning it down and starting over will also fail
[00:30:48] <imode> they will happily shove you through a meat grinder.
[00:30:51] <edk> yes they are evil
[00:30:54] <edk> it's irrelevant
[00:31:05] <imode> it's irrelevant that they're the cause of all of this. okay.
[00:31:10] <imode> have fun in your fantasy land.
[00:31:12] <edk> there are billions of humans
[00:31:20] <kline> it really is just like the whole non-ism vegetarianism. you dont need to be a veggie to save the world, but not having meat some days makes a surprisingly big difference, especially if you also move some meat you do have to less impactful meat
[00:31:27] <kline> you dont need a revolution
[00:31:28] <kline> just do this
[00:31:34] <edk> this means there are going to be a handful of people who are one-in-a-billion evil
[00:31:37] <kline> tell your friends casually and appropriately youre doing it
[00:31:45] <imode> you have a reach of maybe 20 people.
[00:31:48] <kline> and some of them will pick it up and repeat
[00:31:49] <imode> maybe 30.
[00:31:53] <kline> thats fine
[00:32:03] <imode> bezos employs millions.
[00:32:15] <imode> every industry on earth, billions.
[00:32:24] <edk> you're missing the point
[00:32:27] <kline> i think you're getting too into the hole
[00:32:29] <imode> I'm right on the point.
[00:32:32] <kline> change starts with you
[00:32:35] <kline> we cant change everyone
[00:32:42] <kline> but enough people changing themselves is a start
[00:32:53] <imode> right, so that's wy we need to amass a large enough "us" and go kill the people that built this mess.
[00:32:59] <edk> we built this mess
[00:33:02] <imode> I didn't/
[00:33:07] <kline> imode, do you order off of amazon?
[00:33:10] <kline> or have you
[00:33:18] <edk> bezos is a monster yes, but he didn't go out with his monster powers and personally wrest power from the people
[00:33:19] <imode> I stopped a while ago.
[00:33:22] <kline> ok
[00:33:25] <edk> we willingly handed it over
[00:33:31] <edk> and we could still stop
[00:33:31] <kline> so theres a small change, and lots more people are doing that
[00:33:37] <imode> uh, since when did we willingly hand it over.
[00:33:52] <edk> that's what we're doing every time we buy something from him
[00:34:10] <imode> I work for the beast, I can tell you that you deciding not to shop on Amazon won't change a damn thing.
[00:34:15] <imode> at all.
[00:34:19] <imode> you have zero impact. none.
[00:34:25] <kline> you work at amazon?
[00:34:29] <imode> sure do.
[00:34:40] <kline> send out an email to as many people on the day you quit saying why
[00:34:45] <kline> guarantee at least one will follow
[00:34:53] <imode> I'll probably never quit.
[00:35:00] <kline> then youre giving bezos power
[00:35:03] <imode> sure am.
[00:35:09] <imode> my family also needs to eat.
[00:35:13] <imode> and survive.
[00:35:15] <kline> there are lots of other jobs in tech
[00:35:24] <imode> sure, give me one that'll hire me right now.
[00:35:30] <kline> have you started looking?
[00:35:36] <epilys> you'd probably make more change if you sent out a rightwing misogynistic rant as you quit, have the media pick it up, it'd be a great little circus for a few days
[00:35:36] <imode> sure have.
[00:35:37] <kline> you dont need to quit right now, just some time this year
[00:35:43] <kline> thats a good enough start
[00:35:45] <imode> epilys: hahahahaha fuck.
[00:35:54] <imode> kline: you wanna know who's trying to poach me?
[00:35:56] <imode> google.
[00:36:00] <imode> give me an ethical company and we'll talk.
[00:36:16] <kline> what are your interests?
[00:36:19] <epilys> you can look at non-profits
[00:36:20] <imode> epilys: I'm kind of surprised nobody's done that, either sincerely or otherwise.
[00:36:22] <edk> i consider the company that's currently employing me to at least be morally neutral but i'm unwilling to say who they are
[00:36:34] <epilys> imode, well there was that google memo (guy wasn't quitting though)
[00:36:42] <imode> do any of you have two $60k/yr households you have to fund and keep running.
[00:36:53] <kline> >two households
[00:36:53] <kline> why?
[00:37:00] <imode> my parents' and my own.
[00:37:12] <kline> ok, thats fair
[00:37:18] <kline> but in that case, yes, lots of people do
[00:37:24] <imode> okay. they can't work.
[00:37:28] <imode> my wife can't work.
[00:37:47] <imode> weigh that on your mind for a moment.
[00:37:56] <epilys> sounds like a stressful situation imode. take your time deciding things
[00:38:07] <imode> I'm plenty comfortable where I am in the heart of the beast.
[00:38:16] <imode> but do not pretend for a second that it is voluntary.
[00:38:27] <imode> do not pretend for an instant that anything around you is somehow de-facto voluntary.
[00:38:44] <imode> there's "You provide a good service, here's my money." and then there's "We will make ourselves the only option."
[00:39:02] <imode> most industry is doing the latter.
[00:39:04] <edk> you're not going to like this, and i don't mean to say that your choice is wrong, but i believe that it is
[00:39:26] <imode> please elaborate, I'd love for some judgement about how it's voluntary.
[00:39:40] <imode> go on.
[00:39:42] <edk> you're not going to get any judgement from me
[00:40:00] <epilys> https://i.redd.it/4ewhc3a37sc81.gif
[00:40:07] <imode> purdy.
[00:40:18] <imode> reminds me of that triangle drawing app.
[00:40:26] <bontaq> it's really funny to blame the hoi polloi for their choices.  just go work for a different steel mill, stupid lol
[00:40:43] <imode> ..was it triangles or hexagons..
[00:41:47] <edk> i don't blame the workers, i blame us, the people who make six figure $ for keeping capitalism's lights on
[00:41:48] <imode> hexels!
[00:42:02] <imode> edk: why do you think I need to make that amount of money.
[00:42:08] <imode> is it the sky-high rent?
[00:42:20] <imode> is it the 7% increase in inflation over the past year?
[00:42:26] <imode> is it the food prices? the gas prices?
[00:42:34] <imode> is it oil? electricity?
[00:42:41] <bontaq> yes let us all flee to non-capitalism.  it's right over there, see
[00:42:42] <imode> "just move somewhere else" just shut the fuck up.
[00:43:04] <imode> if you can't internalize why things are the way they are then your best course of action would be to staple your mouth shut.
[00:43:12] <imode> once you can, I'll give you the staple remover.
[00:43:14] <imode> shut the fuck up.

[13:28:16] <riv> hmm
[13:28:20] <riv> that makes me think
[13:28:25] <riv> a physical library has finite space
[13:28:34] <riv> but a code library has basically no limit
[13:28:45] <riv> maybe npm would be better if they limited it to 256 MB
[13:28:59] <riv> or 1M lines
[13:57:28] <Brekkjern> Why?
[13:58:43] <riv> so that it's not got loads of rubbish it in no one needs
[13:59:43] <Brekkjern> It would force someone to spend time curating it, sure
[13:59:55] <Brekkjern> But 1M lines is a ridiculously small number
[14:01:46] <defect> 256MB on the other hand sounds like quite a lot :P
[14:03:14] <Brekkjern> Sounds like, but isn't.
[14:03:35] <Brekkjern> Especially if you are to keep older versions of libraries too
[14:04:08] <Brekkjern> And what will happen is that people start compressing shit to stay under the limits, so soon enough everyone will depend on a gzip library and live-decompress the library before running it
[14:04:28] <Brekkjern> Every website will be slow as balls as they have to do that in the JS engine
[14:04:36] <riv> disallow obfuscated code of course
[14:04:48] <riv> and adversarial people
[14:04:53] <riv> the idea is to actually cooperate to make good code
[14:05:13] <Brekkjern> Also, the evil-bit should be set in the IPv4 header if you are malicious.
[14:09:30] <edk> Brekkjern: i mean it's obviously not going to work as a free-for-all like npm is, but i guess the point is that a free-for-all like npm is might just be inherently bad
[14:10:07] <Brekkjern> You are trying to solve a social problem with technology. That is not really going to work.
[14:10:20] <Brekkjern> Curation is the answer, and has always been the answer.
[14:10:35] <Brekkjern> And some sort of chain of trust in that curation.
[14:11:13] <edk> that's what i got from "cooperate to make good code" tbh
[14:11:39] <edk> but i note that linux distros are an example of such curation
[14:12:07] <edk> and everyone is always complaining about how X distro doesn't have Y library
[14:12:13] <Brekkjern> Yep
[14:12:39] <Brekkjern> You'll eventually end up with competing NPMs, or they will all die and everyone will use the least restrictive one'

[17:01:55] <gwozniak> drakonis: I still love CL more than any othes lisp, but it would be nice to see it acknowledge its limitations
[17:02:27] <gwozniak> I'm all for curation, even though it doesn't solve all the problems.  It's better than no curation
[17:02:58] <gwozniak> Maybe that's why I'm not a huge fan of the dependency managers in language toolchains
[17:03:32] <gwozniak> It's not the dependency aspect that rubs me the wrong way, it's the insanity beyond it
[17:07:27] <gwozniak> I really don't like the mindset of "this solution is no good because it does not solve everything"
[17:07:47] <gwozniak> (not that I am directing that at anyone here, just an idle thought from the discussion)
[17:08:21] <gwozniak> I am happy to report that one of my cats is getting great enjoyment from a random piece of string
[17:12:25] <gwozniak> ``#Bitcoin is about power. The Engine of Freedom will not be stopped. States will tumble, but humans – finally again – will thrive,  create abundance, live meaningful lives, and populate the galaxy. That’s why #Bitcoin is the MOST political project ever.''
[17:12:39] <riv> hows that working out for ya?
[17:12:43] <gwozniak> Oh BTC guy, thanks for the laugh
[17:12:54] <riv> i miss when bitcoin was a cipherpunk pipe dream
[17:23:10] <gwozniak> Finally, humans will thrive again!
[17:49:11] <drakonis> gwozniak: they'll never do it
[17:50:45] <gwozniak> No, they won't, but I still love working in CL
[17:51:19] <gwozniak> I wish Robert (ASDF maintainer) all the best.  He seems like a decent guy based on what I've seen on the mailing list

[17:55:26] <gwozniak> So one of my newly hired coworkers is on a "bug" from a client complaining that nothing works when switching to our compiler.  I swear what is happening is that it's actually a C++ project, but they are trying to compile it as a C one
[17:55:50] <gwozniak> drakonis: yeah, I have that queued up to read
[18:03:28] <gwozniak> After nearly 5 years of doing this job, I can't decide on whether deep integration of the compiler and the IDE is a great idea.  There are some great points, but then there is some complete and utter confusion that is easily solved by just knowing what a compiler does
[18:04:45] <gwozniak> Or maybe it's not that.  Maybe it's just that there are many teams that don't ever make an effort to understand at a basic level how their code gets onto the devices they are working with
[18:05:01] <gwozniak> Or even what programming language they are using

[20:18:38] <manicennui> The sigil stuff is not very hard.
[20:19:33] <manicennui> $ is scalar values, @ is an array, and % is a hash. You use $ when accessing scalar values in arrays and hashes.

[20:29:19] <manicennui> For a short while, Perl was the default language for data science. Amazing how Python just completely took over.
[20:30:00] <manicennui> Before it was called data science and was mostly bioinformatics.
[20:30:19] <manicennui> At one point I considered moving into bioinformatics.
[20:31:19] <jlindgren> afaik at my first job (bioinformatics lab at a university) everything was perl
[20:31:28] <jlindgren> genome sequencing is just text right? :P
[20:31:29] <gwozniak> I started my grad work in bioinformatics stuff
[20:31:41] <gwozniak> Perl was the lingua franca back then for sure
[20:33:19] <gwozniak> I was never a huge fan of Perl, but I appreciate it

[20:35:13] <ngoldbaum> webdev
[20:35:20] <companion_cube> luv 2 zope
[20:35:21] <manicennui> I mean for data science.
[20:35:52] <Brekkjern> Apart from Django, I can't really think of anything webdev related with Python
[20:36:07] <Brekkjern> And I doubt that was what propelled it to relevancy in academia
[20:36:11] <indigo> Twisted, Tornado, Pyramid, Pylons
[20:36:14] <indigo> flask
[20:36:47] <indigo> Plz hire me Python recruiter
[20:36:57] <indigo> I know all the buzzwords
[20:37:04] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: 2005-2009 or so the python webdev ecosystem was a lot bigger than today
[20:37:12] <ngoldbaum> and as indigo alluded some
[20:37:19] <Brekkjern> Yes, those are webserver techs, but when I hear about python being ingrained in systems it's always about system scripts and highly technical shit
[20:37:28] <ngoldbaum> of those sites continue chugging along
[20:37:37] <indigo> I guess todays webdev ecosystem is JS
[20:38:10] <ngoldbaum> python in academia wasn’t really a thing until numpy got going
[20:38:38] <ngoldbaum> you can track the growth of the scipy conference over the years as a rough indicator
[20:38:55] <indigo> Somehow everyone forgot how easy rails made things and decided that everything should be an SPA
[20:40:27] <indigo> And then the Apostle Rich Hickey came along, and dictated that things should be “simple, not easy”
[20:40:59] <manicennui> Simple made easy.
[20:41:04] <manicennui> He didn't advocate for making things hard.
[20:41:10] <manicennui> His main point was that there is a difference.
[20:41:24] <manicennui> And most people focus on easy, which generally means, "I'm used to it."

[20:47:29] <manicennui> Fifth slide.
[20:47:57] <manicennui> "The fact that we throw these things around sort of casually saying, oh, I like to use that technology because it's simple, and when I'm saying simple, I mean easy. And when I am saying easy, I mean because I already know something that looks very much alike that. It's how this whole thing degrades and we can never have an objective discussion about the qualities that matter to us in our software."
[20:48:19] <indigo> Ah
[20:48:40] <indigo> I thought it was the difference between "hey, let me use this hairball mega library for my music widget" vs. "let's write a simple music widget for my use case"
[20:49:38] <manicennui> That also plays into it.
[20:50:11] <manicennui> But I'd recommend watching the talk or reading that transcript so I don't paste the entire thing here.
[20:50:32] <manicennui> I think this gets to the heart of function programming.
[20:50:50] <indigo> I have watched the talk, but I might need to watch it again
[20:51:07] <manicennui> Specifically when he goes into complect.
[20:51:30] <manicennui> You might very well need a large library to do what you want with music.
[20:51:39] <manicennui> But there are different ways of writing that library.
[20:52:10] <manicennui> Ideally it would be made up of simple parts that aren't tightly coupled and intertwined.
[20:55:05] <manicennui> Worst case scenario would be a library that is mostly one huge class with each part of the process implemented within the class and lots of shared state.
[20:56:28] <manicennui> But you can also imagine having a nice clean function, separate that can decode the MP3 format, a function that can extract mp3 tags from a file, etc. and compose them all together.
[20:56:49] <manicennui> English good I know.
[20:58:06] <manicennui> Nice clean browser auto-play function to delight your users.
[20:58:21] <indigo> Heh, yes
[20:58:31] <indigo> All about those interfaces
[20:59:32] <manicennui> I really do think that Clojure gets the FP stuff more right than a lot of languages because I don't believe types are the most important thing (I don't think types have anything to do with FP other than being very prevalent in certain languages).
[21:00:37] <manicennui> One could argue that a language like Haskell actually uses types to guarantee purity, but few other languages do that.
[21:01:44] <manicennui> I think immutability is far more important, and once you have that, you basically want something like persistent data structures to make performance adequate.
[21:03:17] <manicennui> Obviously having first class functions is key too, but there are a lot of languages that have that in some form.

[21:42:25] <ngoldbaum> regulators are often wrong, you see, because they don’t have an inside view of how the financial scheme works
[21:42:54] <indigo> IMO more important than immutability, FP, static types is just defining your interfaces well between components
[21:44:42] <manicennui> indigo: I think FP leads to that.
[21:45:08] <manicennui> indigo: I think OO leads to passing in objects, which have huge surface areas.
[21:45:13] <manicennui> Which means your interface is huge.
[21:45:52] <manicennui> Passing in only data severely limits this.

[22:01:45] * manicennui is losing the battle of trying to get Rails developers to avoid using every convenience of Rails just because they can
[22:06:43] <indigo> Look at the bright side, at least it isn't C++ ;)
[22:09:14] <manicennui> It's a mixed bag.
[22:09:24] <manicennui> But ultimately I think it just boils down to a different set of problems.
[22:09:43] <manicennui> I don't think there is any tech stack that is free of problems.
[22:10:13] <manicennui> I don't want to argue with Haskellers about category theory any more than I want to argue with Rails developers about basic development.
[22:10:39] <manicennui> C++ does seem like it has way more potential for arguing though.
[22:10:44] <manicennui> Since the language is so huge and fucked up.
[22:15:39] * manicennui stares at a class with 55 accessors
[22:19:38] * manicennui digs in further and cries.
[22:23:55] <manicennui> They have all these Bar classes which inherit from BarRequestFoo, which inherits from FooRequest, which inherits from XmlSuperFoo, and they modify all of them to make a change.
[22:42:39] <manicennui> I think inheritance is one of the biggest mistakes in OO.
[22:42:47] <manicennui> Always makes code harder to understand.
[22:42:59] <manicennui> For a really small amount of convenience.
[22:43:09] <companion_cube> but if you remove that, what remains?
[22:44:00] <manicennui> Classes that can be instanced, shared state within instances, and state mixed with behavior.
[22:45:22] <manicennui> Many people push "composition over inheritance" in OO.
[22:45:34] <manicennui> But what is meant by that varies a bit depending on language capabilities.
[22:45:49] <manicennui> In Ruby I see many people use mix-ins, which is not exactly what is meant.
[22:48:55] <companion_cube> but like, is Go OO?
[22:49:15] <riv> Do you have any good stuff I could read about composition over inheritance?
[22:51:13] <ngoldbaum> are interfaces distinct from inheritance?
[22:51:36] <companion_cube> I'd say so, yes
[22:51:43] <companion_cube> inheritance is about reusing behavior
[22:51:49] <Geekingfrog> same, it's a way to decouple the implementation vs the behaviour
[22:51:53] <companion_cube> you can even inherit without being a subtype
[22:52:09] <companion_cube> (… in some obscure systems like OCaml's object system)
[22:52:37] <drakonis> ocaml's object system is not quite the same as the others, right?
[22:52:50] <companion_cube> no, not in several ways
[22:53:04] <companion_cube> one could argue it's more powerful than many OO systems :D

[22:55:36] <manicennui> ngoldbaum: Depends whether you can define default implementations in interfaces.
[22:55:46] <manicennui> ngoldbaum: At that point, they have some of the same problems.
[22:56:07] <manicennui> In some languages, an interface is really just an agreement about the signatures.
[22:56:42] <manicennui> companion_cube: I don't know whether people consider Go to be OO.

[22:59:38] <manicennui> riv: I don't have a particular article or whatever in mind to explain composition over inheritance, but there is a wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance

[22:59:45] <riv> ty
[22:59:48] <manicennui> I think it might have been first described in the book Design Patterns.
[23:00:21] <manicennui> The wikipedia article uses C++ unfortunately, which might not be super useful if you aren't familiar with C++ a bit.
[23:01:30] <manicennui> I think the example there is pretty bad because they create a class called Object.
[23:02:29] <manicennui> https://thoughtbot.com/blog/reusable-oo-composition-vs-inheritance
[23:02:30] <buttsbot> Composition vs Inheritance
[23:02:39] <manicennui> That is a decent explanation without code.
[23:03:02] <manicennui> And it does confirm that the saying came from Design Patterns.
[23:05:33] <manicennui> My biggest problem with inheritance is that it always turns into a mess where you have to try to piece together the subclass in your mind.
[23:06:01] <manicennui> I suppose it is slightly less bad when you use a statically typed language and your IDE can figure it out, but you still have to jump around between files.
[23:07:02] <manicennui> It might be tolerable if there were only one level of inheritance, and a very small number of overridden methods.
[23:07:33] <manicennui> And people were super disciplined, but people aren't.
