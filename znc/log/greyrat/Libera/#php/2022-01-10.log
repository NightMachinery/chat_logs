[00:14:54] <relipse> i used that vertical-align: middle a lot!
[00:17:28] <varrg> for a resume, programming languages used is irrelevant. Interested parties will know that once they look at the source. Each project block has only 1 link associated with it, it should rather wrap the entire block: <a href="#"><div class="appitem"></div></a> for easier navigation
[00:18:15] <relipse> is it legal to put divs within <a tags?

[00:39:10] <netfrog> hi, I get a php array from the web application, it starts with array (.. how can I transfer it to a $array in my script?
[00:40:45] <AllenJB> netfrog: What exactly do you mean by "I get a php array from the web application"? (How do you get the array?)
[00:42:25] <netfrog> $row = fread($file, 8129) $row = http://paste.debian.net/hidden/c633fec5/
[00:43:47] <netfrog> AllenJB, Thank you do you know what i mean?
[00:44:18] <relipse> kate was the bomb
[00:44:25] <relipse> that was my favorite editor for linux
[00:44:31] <relipse> has it gotten better?
[00:44:43] <__adrian> netfrog: you want to get the array _as php code_?  https://php.net/var_export
[00:44:50] <varrg> netfrog, you'll want https://www.php.net/eval but the server should return a more suitable format, like json
[00:45:13] <__adrian> eval() is probably not a good idea
[00:45:28] <varrg> __adrian, he is probably getting the result of var_export
[00:45:30] <relipse> my favorte editor is PHPStorm but its having some issues, I may need to roll back
[00:45:33] <netfrog> varrg, json is also possible
[00:45:34] <varrg> but yes, it's a bad way to transfer data
[00:46:05] <__adrian> is this at runtime?
[00:46:11] <shinbet> relipse, depends how far back are you looking. It serves me well. I can massively search stuff in multiple files and do regex search and replaces in I way I can comprehend and it saves me a lot of time, so it's as good as ever for me
[00:46:27] <__adrian> if you're transferring data, then yes - don't use var_export. transfer as json.
[00:46:32] <netfrog> $row is not ia array it a text sting
[00:46:47] <netfrog> i would like to have to array from the text string
[00:46:59] <Blondie101010> what format is it in?
[00:47:05] <Blondie101010> can you show a sample?
[00:47:07] <__adrian> netfrog: are you talking about your paste c633fec5 ?
[00:47:15] <netfrog> yes
[00:47:19] <__adrian> don't transfer data like that.
[00:47:33] <__adrian> use a standardized encoding format, like json.
[00:47:38] <__adrian> https://php.net/json_encode
[00:48:07] <__adrian> $json = json_encode(["a" => "A"]);  $array = json_decode($json, true);

[01:41:10] <__adrian> shinbet: use 3v4l.org. also, you need to include a sample input. might also help to explain what the goal is, here - it doesn't look like anything that something real code might need to do.
[01:41:52] <shinbet> https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1
[01:42:27] <shinbet> the code did it and I solved first puzzle I just want it to do without errors now and if I resolve an error it messes the counter
[01:42:45] <__adrian> k, so you have a list of numbers in a file and you need to compare each to the previous number. is that correct?
[01:43:01] <shinbet> yes
[01:43:05] <__adrian> yeah, it's not "solved" if it errors. it's _broken_ if it errors.  ;)
[01:43:32] <__adrian> $data[$i] > $data[$i-1]  // error is on this line, right?
[01:44:01] <shinbet> yes and i understand its because array does not have -1'st element
[01:44:21] <Albright> So what are you doing that avoids that but causes an incorrect solution?
[01:44:26] <__adrian> no, it's because you're _checking_ for an element  [-1]  when you know (logically) there isn't one.
[01:44:37] <__adrian> think it through
[01:44:47] <__adrian> on the first loop, what is the value of $i ?
[01:45:26] <shinbet> Albright, well if I do what you suggested it is errorless, but then it apparently skipps lastmatching as results 1447 instead of 1448
[01:46:56] <shinbet> __adrian, its 0 during the first as declared in for()
[01:46:59] <__adrian> yes
[01:47:34] <__adrian> and 0 -1 is  -1, and there will never be a  [-1]  and that's why it errors. what is the solution? (just in plain words)
[01:47:57] <__adrian> problem: on the first loop, there's _nothing_ to compare.

[01:48:40] <Blondie101010> could be the reverse
[01:48:49] <shinbet> I was thinking about adding value to array[-1] just to attempt to get rid of error, as the code gave correct answer I just wanted to get rid of the error

[02:08:31] <Albright> netfrog: That syntax is incorrect.
[02:08:38] <__adrian> the first thing to do is understand what the problem is, and what the solution is. if you can't explain it in normal words, you won't be able to write code that does it.
[02:08:57] <__adrian> shinbet: so am i. the php error is telling you about a problem with your code's logic.

[03:30:23] <__adrian> solution: on the first loop, _don't compare_.
[03:32:07] <__adrian> the simplest (that is, not "best" but fewest code changes) solution is to check if it's the first iteration of the loop, and just skip the comparison.
[03:32:26] <__adrian> blondie actually gave you this solution a while back.
[03:32:51] <__adrian> if ($i === 0) { it's the first iteration }

[05:15:35] <CoJaBo> I might get to write and deploy my own Eldritch Horror today. Our latest app was developed for PHP 8.1, as per the client's requirements, so it uses a Fibers-based multitasking class. Now I have to make this work on PHP 7.2, which means polyfilling or something that class to not require Fibers
[05:16:18] <Albright> Nice.
[05:16:49] <CoJaBo> I can't modify any of the existing code either, so no fun hacks like generators are possible either. Has to be in pure PHP
[05:19:08] <CoJaBo> Current plan is to have the task suspend/yield function just call back into the scheduler to start the next task, since I don't see any potential other way of doing this. My sincere future appologies go out to whatever tortured soul is going to have to debug a resulting backtrace when something someday breaks =D
[05:19:58] <CoJaBo> Exceptions are gonna be fun tho. I'm just gonna declare that Undefined Behavior™ and call it a day.

[13:41:20] <biberu> Eugen80: it depends on what "T" is. if it's something primitive (think simple values) it can be ok to create it, but if it's something that e.g. has its own dependencies (that B shouldn't know about) or that you need to be able to configure or swap it out in tests it's better to pass it as an argument
[13:42:18] <biberu> Eugen80: speaking of which, does A use T itself, or is it a dependency of B that's leaking?
[13:42:37] <biberu> Eugen80: and why B::init instead of the constructor? that looks fishy

[13:54:55] <biberu> Eugen80: so it sounds like T has dependencies that B shouldn't need to know about, is that correct?
[13:57:20] <Eugen80> dependences are other layer classes? then yes
[13:59:55] <biberu> that's your answer then, B shouldn't create T
[14:02:54] <biberu> Eugen80: in this case a dependency is anything required to instantiate T. i'm guessing that has e.g. a database connection? that'd be one dependency
[14:04:13] <biberu> Eugen80: if B were to instantiate T it'd need a db connection too, and from there it might leak to A etc.

[17:12:19] <stutz> he don't see an error cos php is probably crashing.
[17:12:35] <Jonos> ill go back and edit the file give me a few :) thANKS
[17:13:36] <__adrian> np
[17:14:03] <__adrian> but seriously, fix error logging. you'll see a message even if parsing fails (as it would here)
[17:14:03] <stutz> catch() does only take one parameter Jonos. you catch an exception and within the {} you handle it.
[17:14:33] <__adrian> also note there's no reason to catch() here, assuming you have error reporting set up correctly
[17:14:53] <__adrian> you're not fixing anything. don't catch() errors unless you're planning to fix them.
[17:15:40] <freeman_h1> Naktibalda, php 8

[17:17:29] <__adrian> freeman_h1: you showed us your cli php version. is that where you're seeing the error? or is the error from the php your webserver is using?
[17:17:51] <freeman_h1> __adrian, the whole vm is running php 8
[17:17:59] <__adrian> do you see this error on the cli or in your web browser?
[17:18:00] <freeman_h1> no other php version in here
[17:18:12] <freeman_h1> __adrian, all api so seeing it on the error log
[17:18:30] <freeman_h1> xdebug also showing it also when i step to the line in question
[17:18:39] <__adrian> make us an example on 3v4l.org
[17:19:51] <Jonos> i fixed the code but i get "Parse error: syntax error, unexpected 'utf8mb4' (T_STRING) in /var/www/html/phpincludes/index.php on line 4" yet i know its requires this encoding for the database what do i do here?
[17:20:49] <__adrian> you probably have a missing/extra 'quote'
[17:21:02] <__adrian> "syntax error" means you typed something wrong and php can
[17:21:09] <__adrian> can't parse your code
[17:21:42] <Jonos> ok back to the code, then i am getting there slowly with PDO its some learning curve tho :D
[17:22:16] <__adrian> this isn't about PDO so far  ;)
[17:22:35] <__adrian> do you have an editor with syntax highlighting?
[17:22:53] <Jonos> yeah i use idle and notepad++
[17:22:54] <Jonos> :)
[17:22:55] <freeman_h1> __adrian, I see what the issue here is. Code is abit unique how it is set up. https://3v4l.org/m3C8S  this is the issue here
[17:23:13] <__adrian> that can help you see basic problems like this. if not, you can also do  php -l your/file.php  and it will tell you if there are syntax errors

[21:43:48] <Kartagis> If I have $options->setApiKey($this->configuration['api_key']); in foo/src/Plugin/Commerce/PaymentGateway/IyzipayOnsite.php and I want to use the configuration of foo, can I use $options->setApiKey(\Drupal\foo\Plugin\Commerce\PaymentGateway\IyzipayOnsite->configuration['api_key']?
[21:44:04] <__adrian> that comparison probably isn't the best approach, but there's nothing i wouldn't expect to work (assuming keys all exist)
[21:44:53] <shinbet> well ok I changed indexing end by by minus2 of what it was so now I only have these
[21:45:04] <shinbet> PHP Notice:  A non well formed numeric value encountered in /home/kentauras/github/pasizaidimai/7.1/adventOfCode2021_1.2.php on line 12
[21:45:22] <__adrian> your print_r line?
[21:45:57] <shinbet> oh its useless
[21:46:21] <__adrian> Faldrosis: "a version of $_SERVER for the cli" doesn't make any sense, as there is no server when you're running php on the cli.
[21:47:37] <__adrian> $_SERVER is literally "information provided by the server."
[21:47:47] <__adrian> no server = no info provided by server
[21:48:09] <__adrian> what's the specific thing you're looking for?
[21:48:57] <Faldrosis> Im looking for cli version of $_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"]
[21:49:41] <__adrian> no such thing exists.

[21:49:48] <__adrian> there's no "document root" on the cli.
[21:50:05] <__adrian> are you trying to (e.g.) include a file?
[21:50:09] <da_wunder> ^ there isn't document root on cli - if you're looking for directory of your script, you could use __DIR__
[21:50:25] <Faldrosis> __adrian: Yes
[21:50:41] <__adrian> ^ very highly recommend you don't use DOCUMENT_ROOT for that (ever)
[21:51:32] <Faldrosis> Ok, what should I use instead?
[21:51:35] <__adrian> for example, if you want to include a file and your filepath is relative to "this directory" then use __DIR__, as da_wunder suggested
[21:51:50] <Faldrosis> Ok
[21:52:09] <__adrian> if it's "relative to <some specific directory>" then you should set up a config value or constant that tells you where that is
[21:53:10] <__adrian> e.g., in your setup,  const PROJECT_ROOT = __DIR__;  and then in other files,  require PROJECT_ROOT . "/path/from/project_root/file.php";
[21:53:10] <Faldrosis> Ok, thanks. Has some rewriting to. :-)
[21:53:30] <__adrian> welcome

[22:09:25] <panella32> I'm getting an integer using $a = (int)readline('Enter an integer: '); but is there any way to put a default value if the user not enter anything for 5sec?
[22:09:42] <relipse> panella32: nope
[22:10:39] <panella32> so impossible to break out of $a = (int)readline('Enter an integer: ') if nothing is entered?!

[22:25:35] <__adrian> shinbet: i'd assume that just makes missing values 0
[22:25:52] <__adrian> have you inspected the values that error?
[22:26:08] <shinbet> all values errored
[22:26:12] <shinbet> I think
[22:26:16] <__adrian> what were they
[22:26:39] <__adrian> (for example)
[22:26:50] <shinbet> they are strings when read from file so those difs indicates to use them as integers which resolves error
[22:27:55] <__adrian> no - "invalid numeric literal" doesn't mean "it's a string with numbers in it."  it means "you have something that looks like a number but isn't valid," e.g.,  09
[22:29:25] <shinbet> __adrian, it was not invalid numeric literal it was "A non well formed numeric value"
[22:29:31] <shinbet> https://github.com/shinbeth/pasizaidimai/blob/master/7.2/docs/img/7.2.png
[22:30:11] <shinbet> indicating them to be used as integers when adding to already kinda declared integers set t 0 which is $x and $y
[22:30:14] <shinbet> https://github.com/shinbeth/pasizaidimai/blob/master/7.2/docs/img/7.2.fixed.png
[22:30:19] <shinbet> resolves errors
[22:30:29] <shinbet> I think erro was because I was adding string to integer
[22:30:33] <shinbet> which worked
[22:30:37] <shinbet> but produced error
[22:30:49] <shinbet> so those diffs solved errors
[22:31:03] <da_wunder> just var_dump those variables to see what those are
[22:31:26] <shinbet> no need to dump they are strings
[22:32:47] *** Joins: varrg (~varrg@h-176-10-198-245.A351.priv.bahnhof.se)
[22:33:40] <da_wunder> so what about then just type cast that whole array like - $amounts = array_map(fn (string $x): int => (int)$x, $amounts);
[22:34:00] *** Quits: ianthrive (~ianthrive@166.70.191.9) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[22:34:26] <shinbet> $x is integer as its declared in C like fashion before loop $x=0; without quotes
[22:34:43] <shinbet> but the $amount[] array contains strings
[22:34:59] <shinbet> so I was adding strings to integers
[22:35:10] <shinbet> arithmetics worked but produced notices
[22:35:35] <shinbet> so at the place of addition I appended (int) before $amount[$i]
[22:35:37] <da_wunder> I was showing an example how you could easily convert that array of strings to array of ints

[23:15:57] <__adrian> "shinbet> $x is integer as its declared in C like fashion before loop $x=0; without quotes"  note this means nothing in php.
[23:16:44] <__adrian> and it's a similar cause. it's not because the value is a string like "123" but that's it's a string like "123 little piggies" or similar
[23:17:14] <__adrian> maybe more whitespace, for example.

[23:25:57] <__adrian> shinbet: https://3v4l.org/noVGL  ← adding _well-formed_ numeric strings to integers is just fine.
[23:26:57] <varrg> I would like this function to be audited: https://3v4l.org/oJ5WC#v8.1.1 it's hard to test it because A) it will normally just loop once and I don't know how to replicate write failure and B) a write error would need to happen just between a multibyte character for the mbstring use to kick in. My worries are that I've never used mbstring before and I'm mostly unsure about mb_strcut over mb_substr but it seems to be the best bet according
[23:26:57] <varrg> to specs. Thoughts?
[23:27:51] <varrg> never mind the odd argument $append, it's there so I can interchangeably call file_put_contents instead.
