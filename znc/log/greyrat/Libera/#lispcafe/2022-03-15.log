[01:52:02] <hayley> What would people consider the first "consumer" 32-bit processor? I could guess the 68000, but that had a 16-bit ALU. Though the 68020 isn't much later.
[01:52:42] <hayley> And the 80386 was only a year later, too.
[01:53:50] <hayley> Wikipedia claims the NS32000 was the first 32-bit chip
[02:01:47] <GreaseMonkey> honestly, i regard the 68000 as 32-bit
[02:02:14] <hayley> Sure.
[02:02:33] <GreaseMonkey> it is practical to operate on 32-bit data entirely within registers, and honestly, the 68020 going to a 32-bit ALU is more of an implementation detail than anything
[02:02:47] *** Joins: Brucio-61 (~Brucio-72@ip-094-114-248-079.um31.pools.vodafone-ip.de)
[02:02:58] <hayley> I mean, the 16-bit ALU is an implementation detail, the Z80 had a 4-bit ALU. But I don't know if anything was restricted to just 16-bit data. 
[02:03:33] * hayley trying to argue that using 16-bit data for a VM is less than worthless.
[02:03:57] <GreaseMonkey> the Z80 can load and store 16-bit data, and it has some 16-bit operations, but it does that by combining two 8-bit registers together
[02:04:14] <hayley> Right.
[02:04:32] <GreaseMonkey> which, of course, could head down an argument that the 8086 was 8-bit, except pretty much anything you can do with 8-bit values, you can do with 16-bit values in that CPU
[02:05:07] <GreaseMonkey> for the 68000, i think the only things you can't do with 32-bit data are multiplication and division via their respective instructions
[02:05:32] <GreaseMonkey> you can do 16 x 16 -> 32 out IIRC
[02:05:47] <GreaseMonkey> though i could be wrong on that
[02:06:11] <GreaseMonkey> and if you start talking about external data busses... then the Nintendo 64 is 9-bit
[02:06:26] <hayley> Well.
[02:06:47] <GreaseMonkey> and of course, the best rebuttal to the external data bus determining the "bitness" of a CPU is that the 8086 and the 8088 differ only in their external interface
[02:07:00] <hayley> It suffices to say, I think, that it would be a hopeless endeavour to port this crap to a machine that is older than the 80386. No one performs dynamic compilation, to my knowledge, so there is also the overhead of interpretation.
[02:07:25] <GreaseMonkey> the Z80 having a 4-bit ALU is a good rebuttal to the ALU width being the sole determinant too
[02:08:22] <GreaseMonkey> hmm, i'd typically still consider the 68000 to be a candidate even if the assembly syntax is conclusive proof that AT%T syntax is backwards
[02:08:45] <GreaseMonkey> hot damn the syntax is the worst assembly syntax i've ever used as far as blowing your foot off goes
[02:08:50] <hayley> Hm, I rather want the time when doing a 32-bit op is no slower than a 16-bit op. So running a smaller ALU for multiple cycles might be an issue.
[02:10:17] <hayley> ...with the exception of multiply and divide, I figure. Having smaller integers is also better for caches and vectorisation, but no one has a compiler, let alone a vectorising one, and one could argue to go smaller, to bytes or even bits for parallelism.
[02:10:49] <GreaseMonkey> on the other hand it's not an *order of magnitude* slower to do 32-bit math on The 68000(tm)
[02:11:04] <hayley> Sure.
[02:11:24] <hayley> I could argue that interpretation overhead swamps doing 32-bit arithmetic on a 16-bit ALU anyway.
[02:11:41] <GreaseMonkey> of course, there is the downside that the 68000 is absolutely awful to write an emulator for
[02:12:16] <hayley> I mean to write an emulator for a made-up instruction set targeting the 68000, not vice versa.
[02:12:46] <hayley> The choice of using 16-bit data and addresses is a complete waste, as far as I can tell.

[05:01:37] <gilberth> pl: signalfd won't help me for I need to block on Mach semaphores, too. Would I need to wait on fds only, my solution would have been easy as I could have an auxiliary fd on which input would appear in case of timeout.
[05:03:19] <gilberth> pl: It's not signals I need to react upon in the first place. It's only that signals are the only way I found to have a timeout with blocking in general and semaphores in particular.
[05:07:34] <hayley> gilberth: When would you say 32 bit machines became readily available?
[05:08:17] <gilberth> Readily?
[05:08:56] <hayley> Maybe when 32 bit desktop sales outnumbered 16 bit, or smth like that. Just wondering for this new article.
[05:09:05] <gilberth> It's either the 80386 or earlier depending on on which market segment you look at. And would you call the 68k machines like the Amgia or Atari ST a 32-bit machine?
[05:10:10] <gilberth> And with PCs the 80386 is earlier than wide-spread use of 32-bit operating systems.

[05:11:41] <gilberth> What is your focus? Word width of the ALU or the size of the address space?
[05:11:59] <hayley> ALU size, I suppose.
[05:12:32] <gilberth> ISA or for real? Available or actually used?

[05:12:53] <hayley> My point, in the end, is that there are few machines for which 32-bit, or even 64-bit arithmetic is slower than 16-bit (with exceptions of multiplication and division). So using 16 bit words in a stupid made-up VM is stupid.
[05:13:33] <gilberth> What about the bus?
[05:13:47] <hayley> gilberth: For real, and actually used. I mean, we could always point to some olde workstation or supercomputer or etc to get large ALU sizes early on.
[05:14:56] <gilberth> In the 50s and 60s a word width of 36bit or even larger was not too uncommon :-p
[05:15:02] <hayley> Well, a 32-bit bus would be nice.
[05:15:11] <hayley> Yeah, now good luck getting a PDP-10 under your desk.
[05:15:35] <gilberth> You don't know what kind of desk I have.
[05:15:54] <hayley> That's true.
[05:16:42] <gilberth> Anyhow. To get some figure I'd pick the advent of the 80386.
[05:18:14] <hayley> Still. The 80386 was released in 1985, but when would you expect to actually buy a machine with one?
[05:19:12] <hayley> You know, I guess it doesn't matter, since it is not 1985, and we are talking about reusing olde hardware.
[05:20:24] <hayley> All in all, the combination of olde hardware, only having naïve interpreters for this VM, and having the wrong word size, lead to a shit experience, that is not worth the effort to me.
[05:21:49] <gilberth> Well, I don't remember. 1985 seems a bit early, I was 11yo by then. But by 1989 I definitely had a '386. Perhaps a year earlier. I don't know.
[05:26:29] * hayley suspects she might need to rely on gilberth as a computer historian.
[05:30:34] <gilberth> Well, for actual use in the PC realm, remember that Windows was very late with actually offering support for 32-bit applications. People had 80386 systems but ran 16-bit software on it.
[05:30:53] <hayley> Right.
[05:31:14] <gilberth> A few applications like CAD would use a DOS extender to run in protected mode.
[05:31:21] <hayley> But I am more focusing on hardware adoption than software, because the software is new.
[05:32:05] <gilberth> Then, I would say 1990 is a save bet. But don't nail me on that, I am bad at remembering exact years.
[05:32:44] <hayley> Thanks!
[05:32:56] <gilberth> What I remember is that I persuaded by dad to get me a copy of XENIX to actually make use of the 32-bit flat address space.
[05:33:56] <hayley> I'd say something like "The choice of using 16-bit words does not improve performance on most desktops manufactured after around 1990."
[05:34:44] <gilberth> That's sound about right. You could research sales figures, if you wish.
[05:35:57] <hayley> It will be an exciting (part of) an article. The VM designer also claims that you could evaluate programs with pen and paper. Never mind the 64 KW of RAM, or that humans famously suck at modular arithmetic (if the number of overflow bugs means anything).
[05:36:28] <hayley> (I mean, it's obviously possible, even for x86-64, but that the VM is designed to allow that. Hm, no.)
[05:38:21] <hayley> But I think the real issue is that I cannot discern any coherent intentions. Even by one author, there is one page which claims "we wish we had a simpler platform, so we could replace bloated software like Photoshop" and then another says "the constraints mean we can't do any real computing, like Photoshop, but constraints are fun."
[05:46:38] <hayley> Best I can do is to handle each separately, I guess. But I'm sure someone will say that, actually, having to reckon with integer types that aren't integers is fun, somehow.
[05:57:53] <hayley> But everything is just wrong if one wants to get the most performance out of olde hardware. I mean, we lose one to two magnitudes of performance (typically) due to interpretation, and those instructions are doing less, as we can only dispatch 16-bit ALU operations. So our 11 MIPS or so are going down the drain.
[05:58:57] <hayley> Granted, the most complex program that I've seen for that VM is an xclock clone (but only a digital clock, methinks). So they aren't doing much anyway. But everyone makes it sound like they have grander intent.
[06:01:42] <hayley> The situation is not much better if one instead uses an ARM microcontroller, or some other embedded hardware that could theoretically be misused for general purpose computing. There are more MIPS to waste, but they are still being wasted.
[06:07:34] <gilberth> hayley, what is it you waste your time on?
[06:08:16] <hayley> gilberth: A sequel to my least popular article, which was called "Terminal Boredom".
[06:10:12] <gilberth> When I read "Terminal Boredom" I always envision a poor girl staring at a VT100 screen and being bored as she cannot come up with something exciting to hack.

[06:18:19] <ck_> huh, so superscript got subscripted "back in the day" ?

[06:19:27] <hayley> That the topic is not MicroPython, so you will get more optimisation advice surely.
[06:21:20] <moon-child> 'two lines for superscript'  yeah, that's that the term version of mathematica does

[06:28:24] <gilberth> Anyhow, Terminal.app is affected, too. You notice when some output is delayed a few seconds.

[06:29:02] <gilberth> hayley: What are you talking about?
[06:29:13] <hayley> About being terminally bored.
[06:29:38] <gilberth> I noticed. Can't you teach some biology to your brother?
[06:30:01] <hayley> I'm not sure, I was never good at it.
[06:30:13] <gilberth> At teaching or at biology?
[06:30:26] <hayley> Biology.
[06:31:08] <gilberth> Then teach him electrical engineering. But that might be dangerous.
[06:31:28] <hayley> I am pretty sure he is not being graded on EE.
[06:31:49] <gilberth> Math? He can't harm himself with math. That ought to be safe.
[06:32:02] <hayley> Right.
[06:32:54] <gilberth> My mother never realized that the 180V DC you need for valves isn't exactly safe. :-)
[06:33:14] <moon-child> my high school biology teacher was very good.  His class was hard, as far as high school classes go, but he was a good teacher, enjoyed teaching, and as far as I knew him a good person too
[06:33:49] <gilberth> My biology classes were boring. Very boring.
[06:34:44] <moon-child> I am not too interested in biology in general.  Especially marine biology, which is my strawman for something that's obviously uninteresting.  (Though my aunt got her degree in marine biology.  Funny how that works.)  But I enjoyed this guy's class
[06:36:22] <gilberth> Well, my classes centered around memorizing things like species and such. Knowledge that you could look up and doesn't provide you with any insight whatsoever about how nature works. I am easily bored by that kind of knowledge. It seems to be so arbitrary.
[06:38:19] <gilberth> I mean, is there "encyclopedia" written on my fore head?
[06:39:31] <gilberth> Actually, the teachers who taught me most weren't actually teaching me in class.
[06:39:55] <moon-child> do I look like I can see your forehead?
[06:40:30] <gilberth> I don't know how you look. Is that a reflexive relation?
[06:40:59] <moon-child> as in, if I'm looking at you, you must also be looking at me?  Plainly not
[06:41:09] <moon-child> (for instance, my eyes are closaed right now...)
[06:41:32] <gilberth> So you can't see me. Good.
[06:42:07] <moon-child> well.  My eyes are open now.  Just saying
[06:42:15] <gilberth> BTW where does this silly idea come from that you can't see me when I close my eyes. I never believed in that.
[06:42:35] <hayley> I failed organic chemistry because I couldn't memorise the reactions.
[06:42:36] <ck_> many small children know the truth
[06:43:11] <ck_> also when you hide your face, you disappear -- fun fact

[09:48:28] <pl> hayley: on PC, real switch to 32bit programming "for good" only came with Windows 95, before that it was a very mixed thing (mostly specialized applications, non-Windows/DOS software, some software that was WinNT only, and some software that did Win32s thing)
[09:48:43] * hayley nods
[09:49:40] <hayley> Still, I'm wondering about when 32 bit hardware became commonplace. People are going to put new software (which hopefully is 32 bit) on olde hardware, so software isn't too relevant to my argument.
[09:50:38] <pl> Macintosh is a weird case as the hw was 32bit but unless you ran non-macintosh OS the platform wasn't 32bit
[09:51:45] <dave0> mc68000 had 32 bit registers but 24 bit address bus
[09:52:44] <dave0> not sure if macintosh used the high 8 bits for tags or whatever, but if they did it broke on 68020 which had the full 32 bit bus
[09:53:34] <hayley> My history question is pretty specific, I figure. When 32-bit ALUs became commonplace, irrelevant to register or bus size or software.
[10:01:16] <pl> hayley: 1980s as a whole decade for having "on desk, personal 32bit ALU"
[10:02:05] <pl> 1970s if we're going for big iron
[10:09:43] <hayley> I think I'll go with 80s then. Thanks!
[10:13:58] <hayley> I also should measure the actual slowdown due to interpreting, rather than my conservative "somewhere between 10× and 100× slower" guess. But the lower bound of 1/10 the speed, as well as time possibly lost to simulating a larger word size with 16-bit instructions, just sounds awful already, when on a relatively quite slow machine to start with.
[10:25:50] <shka> well
[10:26:09] <shka> back when 16 bit programming was common place
[10:26:41] <shka> it was also because memory was expensive and in low quantities 
[10:26:48] *** Joins: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv)
[10:27:04] <hayley> If memory is an issue, why is 16 bit any better than 8 or even smaller?
[10:27:18] <shka> because 8 is not very useful
[10:27:27] <hayley> And 16 is?
[10:27:40] <shka> it is, and programmers were used to it
[10:28:10] <shka> just like today somebody may consider going for 32 bit build of C program
[10:29:23] <shka> pointers, memory alignment 
[10:29:28] <shka> it adds up 
[10:29:34] * shka shrugs
[10:30:02] <hayley> I guess, but picking 16 still feels arbitrary to me.
[10:30:53] <shka> well, that's what hardware could do, and 8 bit ints are annoying bunch
[10:31:07] <shka> 8 bit pointers also leave you with absurdly tiny space
[10:31:33] <shka> 16 bits not nearly as painful
[10:33:57] <hayley> Sure.
[10:34:06] * moon-child hands shka a segment
[10:34:20] <hayley> But now I doubt you could find 16-bit hardware too easily.
[10:34:30] <shka> today?
[10:34:36] <shka> or back in the 1992?
[10:34:58] <shka> duke nukem 3d required 16mb of RAM in the system requirements
[10:35:11] <hayley> Today.
[10:35:39] <shka> that wasn't low tiny memory space back in the 1996 PC
[10:35:40] <hayley> They probably say that it's easier on olde hardware to have small word sizes. But I say you won't find such hardware too easily.
[10:35:56] <shka> hayley: absolutely!
[10:36:10] <shka> i was only referring to the historical conditions
[10:36:38] <hayley> Yes, I was looking for a time, so that I can say "Good luck finding a computer manufactured before 1990" or something.
[10:37:21] <shka> maybe some ARMs run in 16 bits
[10:37:53] <hayley> I'm not sure if ARM has ever been 16 bit. Though there are other instruction sets for microcontrollers, which are 8 or 16 bit.
[10:37:59] * |3b| thought arms were 32, but some other popular microcontrollers are still 16
[10:38:31] <hayley> The actual usability of such a tiny machine as a "personal computer" is another topic, but 32-bit ARMs are pretty cheap.
[10:38:47] <shka> yeah
[10:39:12] <shka> anyway, i just wanted to shed some light on why people used to prefer 16 bits
[10:39:15] <|3b|> few $ of arm is probably better processor/ram than early 80s :)
[10:39:39] <shka> btw, it wasn't even uncommon for a few years to use 32 bit OS on 64 bit PC
[10:39:41] <hayley> Thanks.
[10:39:43] <|3b|> nowhere to plug in the sound blaster though
[10:39:55] <shka> and reasons were exactly the same
[10:40:39] <|3b|> $20 might get you a 64bit arm, with enough built-in stuff to use as a computer
[10:40:42] <shka> |3b|: probably most if not all :P
[10:41:12] <shka> 80s computers although interesting and unusual were not fast :P
[10:41:31] <shka> not by today standards anyway
[10:42:16] <|3b|> pi pico for $4, 133MHz, 264k ram, 2mb flash
[10:42:48] <|3b|> wiring up an ISA bus to the GPIO pins left as an exercise for the reader
[10:43:30] <|3b|> dual core even, do that in 80s :)
[10:44:10] * shka thinks that azure appservice defaults to 32 bits even today
[10:45:48] <hayley> Java still has this idea of "compressed OOPs" where pointers are 32 bits on a 64 bit machine. It's basically free on x86-64, to my knowledge.
[10:46:45] <moon-child> many people are not using java, though
[10:46:51] <hayley> Again, it's a good idea, but you could optimistically go even tighter, and use, say 8 bits for relative pointers, if you have objects that are clumped up in memory.
[10:46:53] <moon-child> hence e.g. x32 (which is apparently being killed in linux atm?)
[10:47:00] <hayley> moon-child: What about V8? <https://v8.dev/blog/pointer-compression>
[10:47:00] -ixelp- Pointer Compression in V8 · V8
[10:47:09] <hayley> Sure, not in servers.
[10:47:23] <moon-child> people are using both js and java in servers, sooo
[10:47:46] <hayley> *Sure, not in every server.
[10:48:02] <moon-child> re 8-bit pointers: it's very easy in apl :)
[10:48:36] <hayley> Yes, if you cannot mutate arrays, then you don't have to manage the case where you suddenly have a larger pointer.
[10:48:48] <moon-child> apl implementations mutate
[10:49:04] * hayley taps the "implementation issue, not a language issue" sign
[10:49:17] <moon-child> :D
[10:50:20] <shka> hayley: depends
[10:53:29] <shka> some language are actually about fiddling with bits and memory
[10:53:34] <shka> low level
[10:53:58] <hayley> I don't think only having one size of integer is any good for that.
[10:54:13] <hayley> And, good luck with that, when all implementations are interpreters.
[10:54:15] <shka> well, application dependent 
[10:54:20] <shka> what' can i say
[10:54:40] <moon-child> it's useful to have size-specific peek/poke instructions
[10:54:45] <shka> ok, time to take shower and cycle to work
[10:54:53] <moon-child> beyond that, I agree, there is not much point
[10:55:07] <moon-child> have fun at work
[10:57:14] <moon-child> in my crappy lisp/os/thingy, I made an abstraction over a pointer, which is bounds-checked.  Obviously, it is possible to forge such an object; but once it is created, it is not possible to use it to forge accesses to locations not originally intended.  Arbitrary peekn/poken are supported (and bounds-checked); higher-level abstractions are used to create structs/whatever (e.g. acpi tables ..)
[10:58:31] <|3b|> yeah, need to be very specific when dealing with memory mapped hardware
[11:00:32] <hayley> I can't imagine any application for which 16-bit words are the only compression technique, and only having 16 bits doesn't hurt elsewhere.
[11:03:39] <hayley> There are bound to be some, but it is a stifling design choice.

[11:43:05] <aeth> in general, though, the focus has been on bandwidth over latency
[11:43:19] <aeth> "fast internet" never advertises low latency, even though that's another reasonable definition of "fast"

[11:47:42] <hayley> aeth: Really, the issue is that running an interpreter for an ill-suited VM, on old hardware, is taking an already slow thing and making it even slower.
[11:48:01] <hayley> You can probably write low latency programs, nonetheless, but the actual MIPS you can get out of it will be dismal.
[11:51:44] <hayley> With all that, I can't see how the claims that this configuration will allow one to use older computers for longer would hold
[11:53:38] <|3b|> what's the context?
[11:53:55] <Lycurgus> personal computers of the 80s booted quickly because they didn do much in boot other than load bios

[11:56:25] <|3b|> ah, ok. thought i just missed stuff from not reading scrollback :)
[11:56:38] <aeth> Lycurgus: yeah but most of what a modern computer is loading is bloat
[11:56:46] <aeth> stumpwm is pretty much an instant load
[11:56:51] <hayley> I try not to name the project I'm critiquing until I know I have a solid critique of it.
[11:57:16] <ck_> but how will you tell the weather without the microsoft [tm] [r] AccuWeather [tm] tile in your start menu?
[11:57:30] <Lycurgus> aeth, well modern personal computers are more like the mainframes of the 80s which did take time to fully boot
[11:57:43] <hayley> BUT: someone makes a virtual machine specification, which is like a fictional RISC computer. Claims it is useful for reusing old hardware, with an article on an idea for allowing better reuse of hardware, by optimisation and social factors.
[11:58:25] <Lycurgus> as far as antiquities, i'm satisfied with stuff like hercules
[11:58:41] <hayley> However, the reference implementation is a naive interpreter written in C, and the VM is limited to 16-bit address and data. So, one must wonder, what's this crap going to be useful for, and is using it on old hardware actually going to be bearable?
[11:59:44] <Lycurgus> also my linux and mac hosts don't take that long, the mac mini takes maybe 30s
[11:59:49] <hayley> It seems ironic to me, that this project intentionally introduces systematic inefficiencies in running a program, and no one has done anything to improve on that.
[12:01:36] <hayley> The rest of the article is about similar irony. A game developer gives a speech about high level languages causing the collapse of civilisation, but can't offer any advice on how not to blow your foot off with low level languages, other than "just fire everyone that makes mistakes"? Oops!
[12:01:37] <dave0> sectorlisp runs in a 64k segment

[21:39:24] <shka> Zelensky said that negotiations are going better, there are 3 EU PMs on the way to Kiev, and Russia is supposed to start bonds buyback tomorrow
[21:39:35] <shka> and you need credit to fund the war

[21:43:53] <gilberth> Yes, and they begged to use rubel for that. But: Who would accept rubel?
[21:45:26] <shka> ... and without ability to credit, they either print rubels and go into hyperinflation spiral or swallow the pride and negotiate peace which would include unfreezing their reserves 
[21:45:48] <shka> which saves the country from economic downfall

[21:47:40] <gilberth> shka: Who's endgame?
[21:47:44] <shka> Putin
[21:48:11] <gilberth> You tell me, I was wondering all the time what good this war would do for Russia.
[21:48:55] <shka> well, that's why i dare to hope that this could be the end
[21:49:21] <gilberth> I mean, the US won the natural gas issue.
[21:50:38] <shka> whatever, i just hope that rape, destruction, and murder is at end
[21:50:41] <semz> "no Ukraine in NATO" seemed to be a pretty major goal for the Russians and Zelensky recently said that it'll probably go that way
[21:50:51] <shka> i am simple man you see
[21:51:14] <shka> semz: Ukraine would not be accepted into NATO in foreseeable future anyway 
[21:51:22] <gilberth> btw, my cousin should watch less news for he is concerned whether we could heat the house next week, get gasoline for the car, or even food. *sigh*
[21:51:41] <shka> germany is food exporter, no?
[21:51:46] <semz> dunno, Ukr itself seemed to expect different results and was certainly pushed in that direction

[21:52:25] * gilberth shrugs.
[21:52:31] <shka> semz: NATO does not accept members with unresolved border disputes 
[21:52:56] <gilberth> Anyhow, even w/o this war, I don't believe Ukraine would have been in the NATO anytime soon.
[21:53:00] <shka> in other words, Crimea would had to return into Ukraine for that to happen
[21:53:03] <shka> and Donbas
[21:53:51] <shka> and if that happens, holy shit, total victory

[21:54:28] <shka> which i want for them, but it is not very likely IMHO
[21:55:09] <gilberth> And w/o the war there would be Nord Stream 2. Germany would happily buy natural gas as all the time and even less so through the Ukraine. So this war doesn't improve the situation for Russia in any war. But perhaps it's naïve to assume that this is rational in any way. I am really puzzled.
[21:55:10] <semz> Couldn't they also strategically drop Crimea to get NATO access?
[21:55:26] <shka> semz: unacceptable politically 
[21:56:02] <shka> gilberth: well, remember what happens in 2008 and 2014

[21:56:45] <shka> they took crimea and set record sales of gas into europe the next year

[21:57:26] <shka> did that even put flinch on the NS2 plans?
[21:57:29] <shka> NOPE
[21:57:49] <gilberth> I was thinking you spoke about Maidan protests.
[21:57:59] <shka> so Russia assumed that they are allowed to do whatever it want's with the Ukraine
[21:58:31] <shka> and sanctions were moderate at best
[21:59:15] <shka> this all could be stopped right there 
[21:59:41] <gilberth> Well, Ukraine is a bit larger than the Crimea and what perhaps is more important shares borders with the EU and NATO.
[22:01:11] <shka> regardless you may notice how they may conclude that west is weak and in the state of crisis 
[22:01:39] <gilberth> Crisis? How so? That's ridiculous.

[22:04:00] <ck_> luckily, hunter biden fixed that right up
[22:04:42] <shka> Germany, the bulwark of stability in Europe was getting hooked on the Russian gas
[22:04:59] <gilberth> shka: Granted. Europe could be in better shape. Yet I don't think it's weak. What ever weak should be here.
[22:05:03] <shka> i simply think that's how Russia seen this, and they miscalculated 
[22:05:05] <shka> a lot
[22:05:13] <gilberth> shka: Germany hooked itself.
[22:05:20] <shka> yes
[22:05:35] <shka> anyway, it is not about facts, it is about perception
[22:05:51] <shka> this is not the first time such mistake was made 
[22:05:58] <gilberth> And I personally wasn't concerned of this because I believe in peace though trade. I was wrong.
[22:06:19] <shka> peace through trade works very well, with France 
[22:06:22] <shka> or UK
[22:06:45] <shka> in Russia it is peace through power
[22:06:52] <shka> different political culture
[22:07:02] <gilberth> Peace though power sounds a bit paradox.
[22:07:20] <gilberth> * through :-)
[22:07:25] <shka> not if you consider how Russia operates
[22:07:38] <gilberth> But "though" makes sense, too.
[22:07:43] <shka> it simply pushes until something pushes back
[22:08:03] <gilberth> shka: Well, I gather that I misjudged Russia all the time.
[22:08:49] <shka> i think that the core problem is that people in the west judge Russia by the perspective of the Russian culture
[22:08:50] <gilberth> Perhaps it was more wishful thinking on my part.
[22:09:32] <shka> poets, composers, ballet etc.
[22:09:51] <shka> but the political culture is very different thing
[22:10:35] <gilberth> Perhaps, they never really had a democratic system, had they?

[22:40:40] <pl> it doesn't help that this time, PiS was very prepared for "never give up rule"
[22:42:08] <shka> it is the same in Hungary i suspect, but there it is driven by WW1 grief
[22:42:33] <shka> how they lost a lot of territory after dissolution of austro-hungary 
[22:42:51] <sthalik> right-wing populism is a natural consequence of neoliberal policies
[22:43:04] <shka> irony is that dissolution of austro-hungary was caused by the weak state of the empire
[22:43:18] <shka> and the main reason of that state was the hungary itself :P
[22:43:29] <shka> and now they are in the EU :P
[22:44:22] <shka> anyway, thing is, we have other myths to cherish in Poland
[22:44:23] <pl> not sure if it's natural, but capitalism/neoliberalism was always better friend with right-wing nationalism than other forces, and there's a good reason why those forces often bring a bit of "social" thought as well due to fertile ground created by rampant neoliberalism
[22:44:39] <sthalik> pl, end goal of that is a two-party state like the US or the UK. not really an improvement over what we have now.
[22:45:53] <shka> and i think that the my main point is, we may transform ourself by focusing on those alternative myths
[22:46:22] <pl> shka: I'll give you an example that many people probably miss: "Ogniem i Mieczem"
[22:47:45] <pl> which explicitly edited the background history to push idea that "if we weren't so stupid, there would be a more powerful Commonwealth of Three Nations" instead of Partitions
[22:48:06] <shka> yeah
[22:48:37] <shka> there would be Federation of Nations dedicated to protection of personal and political freedoms... WAIT A SECOND
[22:50:22] <shka> anyway, history of Poland and the larger commonwealth is complicated and long, you can build whatever you like out of it
[22:50:43] <shka> but there is only one political force actually playing this game
[22:51:18] <shka> which i think is a problem, because man is a not rational being 
[22:52:06] <shka> the imagined is as much important as the material 
[22:54:45] <pl> Well, Razem does play it up a bit, usually shocking everyone in their yearly "is this polish constitution or Das Kapital/Communist Manifesto"
[22:54:48] <shka> selwyn: anyway, that's my point of view, agree with pl, Poland certainly was democratic state, and is still is (all be it with obvious flaws), I feel like we have potential to transform into something better in the future, but this will take time
[22:55:43] <pl> PTerry talked (in Hogsfather) about "believing in little and big lies" that makes a difference between ape and human
[22:55:59] <shka> pl: exactly
[22:56:14] <sthalik> pl, does Razem have any other plans than injecting identity politics wherever possible?
[22:56:18] <sthalik> doesn't seem like it
[22:56:18] <pl> where the big lies are things like justice and duty, and they can only become real if enough people believe in them strongly enough
[22:56:32] <sthalik> what you mean by 'better' is more wealth extraction toward the West
[22:57:25] <pl> sthalik: umm, they do considerable work on workers rights and other social programs. Identity Politics is mostly amplified by right wing (PO, PiS, and further right)
[22:58:07] <pl> sthalik: shka said nothing about wealth extraction toward the west (something that our current kleptocracy didn't stem at all)\
[22:59:11] <pl> and honestly is heavily accelerated by the stereotypical "polish boss/entrepreneur"
[22:59:52] <sthalik> pl, that comes with the territory when liberals come into power. their voter base is upper-middle-class PMC twats, who despite decent hard-working people.
[23:00:28] <sthalik> "osoby rodzące" and other idpol drivel is what appeals exactly to those PMC types
[23:00:38] <pl> sthalik: some do, some don't. Honestly a big chunk of what PO didn't get is that they never really made a reason to stick with them, and that's why they lost
[23:02:18] <pl> sthalik: haha nope. Especially since the main difference between PiS (which masks its liberal roots) and PO (which doesn't) is that PO continues "condescending tolerance for existence so long as they hide" approach, while PiS found a political gold mine in accepting more hateful voices

[23:05:26] <shka> not because it is objectively wrong
[23:05:32] <shka> but how it is used 
[23:06:14] <sthalik> seems like the rightoids were vindicated in not accepting any third-world migrants *grin*
[23:06:34] <sthalik> we're gonna be a 40 million nation again
[23:07:21] <shka> well, enough of Polish people complaining
[23:07:25] <shka> :P
[23:08:04] <pl> sthalik: more like they would now pretty-please use the same procedure they campaigned against
[23:08:41] <sthalik> pl, come again?
[23:08:53] <shka> that's a lot for opinion for now 
[23:09:07] <shka> selwyn: more then you bargained for i think
[23:09:22] <selwyn> i think i understand the argument
[23:09:27] <selwyn> but i am not convinced
[23:09:39] <selwyn> illiberalism is a central and eastern european vernacular
[23:09:58] <shka> it is... now
[23:10:08] <shka> but it was not always in the past
[23:10:17] <shka> unless you are talking about Russia
[23:10:22] *** Quits: szkl (uid110435@id-110435.uxbridge.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[23:10:30] <selwyn> well, they had a shitty democracy in the 90s
[23:10:48] <pl> sthalik: EU had a procedure to dislocate refugees so that instead of overwhelming local services they would be in pretty small pockets all over union. Polish right wingers campaigned strongly against it, even when the proposed move was just 7k people, talking about how the refugees should stay in the first safe country
[23:10:51] <selwyn> the state of contemporary russia wasnt the result of some natural principle either
[23:11:02] <shka> selwyn: 10 years out of how many centuries? :P
[23:11:22] <sthalik> pl, no one wants to turn the Hohols away
[23:11:34] <sthalik> well, except for some fringe elements
[23:11:35] <selwyn> again, you could make the same argument for the rest of eastern europe
[23:11:42] <shka> selwyn: not really
[23:12:05] <sthalik> also, it's even good for 'the economy' to invite them in
[23:12:08] <pl> sthalik: they would love to, but the major funder and coordinator of anti-refugee rhetoric just had their bank accounts frozen :P
[23:12:27] <selwyn> poland was a military regime in the interwar period, as was estonia (iirc) not sure about the others
[23:14:15] <shka> selwyn: well, notice how Russia went from mongol subject into tsarist repressive system into communist repressive system into short hickup into putinism
[23:15:42] <shka> Poland went from tribal system into feudal system, into feudal union, into elective monarchy federation, into occupation, into military dictatorship, into occupation, into flawed democracy 
[23:16:21] <shka> military dictatorship was honestly improvement given the situation :P 
[23:16:49] <pl> and honestly I would say "occupation" is too heavy a word, used mostly to "blackwash" events for better contrast
[23:17:04] <shka> well, ok
[23:17:21] <shka> anyway, political system in Poland was not the choice of Poland at that time
[23:17:31] <shka> let's leave it at that
[23:18:10] <shka> anyway, let me repeat, Polish history is long and turbulent, you can cherry pick whatever the hell you want out of it
[23:23:46] <shka> selwyn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJmSl148p_I i find that this video summarize this as well as possible in 15 minutes
[23:23:47] -ixelp- History Summarized: Poland - YouTube
[23:25:07] <selwyn> i accept that polish history is complicated
[23:25:22] <selwyn> but i don't accept that because russia isn't democratic it can't be european
[23:25:38] <selwyn> russia has been european since the 19th century at least
[23:25:50] <pl> no one says russia can't be european
[23:25:52] <shka> mmmm...
[23:26:00] <shka> not sure if it's true
[23:26:04] <pl> it's just reverted totally into mafia government
[23:26:20] <selwyn> i would say that the development of russian imperialism in central asia mirrored european colonalism in other places
[23:26:31] <selwyn> i.e. they did the most european thing you can do
[23:26:34] <pl> selwyn: ahhh
[23:26:53] <pl> you have fundamental misattribution as to what eastern europeans say when they say that Russia isn't european
[23:27:23] <selwyn> i mean, genetically maybe they are not
[23:27:23] <pl> it's not about colonizing Siberia etc.
[23:27:27] <selwyn> but i don't care about that shit
[23:27:45] <pl> (and genetically they would be strongly european)
[23:27:56] <shka> selwyn: no, it is not that
[23:28:40] <shka> Russians are genetically European, but culturally they are their own thing
[23:28:43] <pl> selwyn: when eastern europeans talk about Russia being "asian", it's essentially a throwback to how Duchy of Moscow rise to power was related to being tax collectors for Mongol Golden Horde
[23:28:50] <sthalik> but you're talking about the ruskie and not general RF citizenry?
[23:29:09] <pl> people don't necessarily remember the mongol part, but the insult goes that far back
[23:29:19] <sthalik> they now have a ton of kebab in the big cities
[23:29:23] <shka> well, it is more then the insult 
[23:29:39] <pl> sthalik: and Tsarist attitude that only "real russian" can be in charge
[23:29:56] <shka> after centuries of mongol rule, Duchy of Moscow resembled Mongols in multiple ways
[23:30:17] <shka> they dressed like mongols, wage wars in mongol way, etc.
[23:30:58] <pl> it's also an insult related to perception of lawlessness and corruption in Asia, at least from polish pov
[23:31:10] <shka> they ruled with iron fist
[23:31:10] <pl> so it's a colonialist attitude in a way to russians
[23:31:12] <shka> ALWAYS
[23:32:00] <shka> and centuries later russians were still resisting influence of european way of life
[23:32:22] <shka> that's their current thing 
[23:32:25] <shka> that's their myth
[23:32:34] <pl> what remained of slavic/nordic council system was destroyed quite early in comparison to absolutism in the west, with самодержавие ruling above al
[23:33:03] <pl> selwyn: and yes, Putin is pushing myth of one single unified (tsarist) Russia
[23:33:19] <pl> it's also why Ukrainians are fighting the meme war as much as physical
[23:33:33] <pl> the memes are literally how cultural identity is built and survives
[23:34:07] <pl> it's why German Anthem starts with "Deutschland, Deutschland uber alles", even if they don't sing the first two verses
[23:34:33] <selwyn> theres a verse of god save the queen about killing scots
[23:34:36] <selwyn> which isnt sung anymore
[23:35:11] <pl> (first verse is literally trying to teach a meme on how Germany as a whole should be placed over local feudal fiefs, second verse is effectively a bar song about beer and women)
[23:38:17] <pl> polish anthem is effectively about it not mattering that there might not be "Poland" on the map /right now/, we will come back fuck up the occupiers
[23:38:35] <pl> and we will continue fucking them up till there's someone calling themselves "polish"
[23:40:41] <pl> soviet anthem is a weird mix of hero worship, bit of pan-Rus nationalism, and something that is arguably a summary of every Civilization game ever
[23:42:08] <pl> my opinions about US anthem are fit for starting bar fights, not polite society, but years before a tired greek man selected it for americans, there was widely sung "Battle Hymn of The Republic", but I suspect it might have annoyed racists and dispossed slave owners
[23:44:25] <pl> I mean, sure, I don't like the religious bits, but then we give middle finger to most of Western Europe *and* Russia (and arguably parts of middle east and africa) every time we sing the refrain of polish anthem
[23:45:00] <selwyn> ukraine's national anthem is 'ukraine has not yet perished' 
[23:45:04] <selwyn> most defeatist song title ever
[23:45:12] <selwyn> i assume the original is more stirring
[23:45:34] <shka> selwyn: read as "Ukraine is not yet lost!"
[23:46:27] <selwyn> polish writers traditionally seem to be anticolonial
[23:46:40] <shka> yeah
[23:46:49] <shka> also, not only writers
[23:46:58] <pl> selwyn: polish anthem title is effectively the same
[23:47:41] <shka> Haiti won independence with the help of the polish people actually

[23:49:56] *** Joins: ec (~ec@gateway/tor-sasl/ec)
[23:53:08] <pl> selwyn: also, the proper full title of Ukrainian anthem is "Glory and Freedom of Ukraine has not yet perished"
[23:53:51] <pl> but "not yet perished" while literal translation should be treated more as challenge and defiance
[23:56:22] <pl> oh lawd, the original poem is /brutal/ with Chmielnicki
[23:57:31] <pl> > Oh Bohdan, Bohdan // Our great hetman // What for did you give Ukraine // To wretched muscovites?! // To return her honor, // We lay our heads // We shall call ourselves Ukraine's // Faithful sons!
[23:59:32] <shka> well, i am not fun of Russia as you may have noticed 
[23:59:34] <shka> still
[23:59:35] <shka> DAMN
