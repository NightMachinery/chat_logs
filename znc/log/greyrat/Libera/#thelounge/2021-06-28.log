[19:14:16] <frostblade> lazyreader: something built into the thelounge.chat web client
[19:16:21] <bookworm> frostblade: assuming you use the sqlite storage there's a search functionality in the prerelease
[19:17:09] <frostblade> oh
[19:17:18] <bookworm> pretty bare bones due to some limitations we need to get rid of prior to having fancier search but it works reasonably well
[19:17:33] <frostblade> if it's able to search by text, that's good enough
[19:17:45] <frostblade> at least for me
[19:18:53] <bookworm> yes
[19:19:07] <bookworm> can't do context yet though (missing primary key)
[19:19:44] <Geezabiscuit> Is there a target date for the next release?
[19:20:58] <bookworm> soon â„¢
[19:23:11] <Geezabiscuit> If I installed with 'yarn global add thelounge' can I upgrade by just running 'yarn global add thelounge@next' or do I need to remove the existing release first?
[19:23:28] <bookworm> need to figure out some packaging related issues first and there's still some PRs which might be nice to include
[19:24:27] <Geezabiscuit> When I say "upgrade" I mean switch from a stable release to a prerelease.
[19:27:05] <bookworm> I don't like npm messing with my root filesystem... they've been known to fuck up permissions pretty badly. Can't help you there
[19:27:31] <bookworm> (well, yarn didn't... still)
[19:38:30] <Jay2k1> Geezabiscuit: i think i did that successfully (upgrading)

[22:19:55] <printf> when i leave a channel, does the logs/history gets cleared in the sqlite3 file
[22:32:08] <dragonshardz> wouldn't that defeat the purpose of having logs in the first place?
[22:45:06] <printf> im constantly worried that my instance will use eat up the disk spaces  very soon if thelounge logs eveyrthing
[22:46:28] <printf> im selfhosting it in a container and hoping theres a way to rotate the logs or deleting logs older than x number of days
[22:47:36] <printf> theres a guide that creates a cronjob and manually clears it but i dont think the docker container has sqlite3 installed
[22:47:52] <Bytewave> sqlite3 is part of the application
[22:47:58] <Bytewave> it's not a separate server
[22:48:14] <Bytewave> ... although I guess you would need a CLI version of it to prune the logs outside of TL
[22:48:15] <Bytewave> ignore me
[22:51:41] <Snuupy> printf: I was looking into using a compressed volume for sqlite logs
[22:51:50] <Snuupy> I haven't decided between btrfs and zfs yet
[22:55:40] <printf> Bytewave i mean you still probabaly need a sqlite3 client to delete logs
[22:55:51] <printf> this is the link im refering to https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/wiki/Purging-SQLite-database-from-logs-older-than-X-days
[22:56:38] *** Quits: jsrnop (~mark@user/jsrnop) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[22:56:40] <printf> thelounge saves the logs in sqlite and it's inside an sqlite3 file, 
[22:57:25] *** Joins: jsrnop (~mark@user/jsrnop)
[22:57:27] <Bytewave> you could always put together another container that shares thelounge's volume
[22:57:33] <printf> but need to install an sqlite3 client to open it up and delete it, but since im using the docker container i cant run that command :/
[22:58:36] <printf> Bytewave i just feel like it's such an essential thing it should be baked in as a feature
[22:59:10] <Bytewave> I don't disagree with you on that one
[22:59:13] <printf> or something like : max number of messages to log per channel 
[22:59:19] <Bytewave> it would be nice to have
[23:00:51] <printf> thing is i gave my container only 1GB of storage 
[23:01:36] <printf> and if i join ##news, that storage space will evaporate in a few months probably
[23:03:45] <printf> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/2556
[23:03:54] <printf> man... wontfix :(
[23:11:11] <printf> i guess the other way is i  manually exec into the docker container and then install sqlite3 then create a cronjob 
[23:11:19] <printf> so stupid lol
[23:20:55] <MaxLeiter> printf: you can look into something like https://hub.docker.com/r/blacklabelops/logrotate/
[23:25:53] <Bytewave> that would work for textual logs, but you probably wouldn't want to do it to the sqlite db
