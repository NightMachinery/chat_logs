[01:09:02] <krumelmonster> Interesting. I never cared about CPUs so I didn't know such things existed

[09:13:35] <yrdsb> I tried ubuntu 21.10 and i had problem
[09:13:38] <yrdsb> the first part
[09:13:42] <yrdsb> so i switch to arch
[09:13:48] <yrdsb> should i switch back to ubuntu

[09:17:47] <yrdsb> I am trying to read the wiki
[09:17:52] <yrdsb> but the commands are not working
[09:18:13] <thurstylark> then describe the specific instructions that you're struggling with, what you tried, and what the result was
[09:18:32] <yrdsb> I am struggling with  this command $ gpg --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve --verify archlinux-version-x86_64.iso.sig
[09:18:37] <yrdsb> i used linux for a year
[09:18:44] <yrdsb> should i switch to arch yet
[09:19:07] <thurstylark> if you're having trouble with this, I would suggest a different distro with an installer
[09:19:15] <yrdsb> i upgrade my ubuntu 20.04 to 21.10 and then 21.10 is so unstable and ubuntu 20.04 is very stable
[09:19:27] <thurstylark> there are also several arch-based distros that add an installer if you want to go that route

[10:02:00] <feinedsquirrel> right, that is what I'm used to, just while we were on the topic, I wanted to ensure keybindings or something else didn't need special treatment. Thanks!
[10:02:15] <tirnanog> shouldn't do. it's just more shell code, in the end.

[10:03:30] <feinedsquirrel> tirnanog: so you recommend just one, long .zshrc?
[10:04:45] <susi> I have .zshrc, .zshenv and .zshalias, and functions in ~/shell/zsh/fun
[10:04:54] <tirnanog> feinedsquirrel: I wouldn't recommend anything in particular. how dotfiles are structured is a matter of taste.

[10:05:43] <susi> I set environment in .zshenv, define aliases in .zshalias, and have function definitions separated into shell/zsh/fun
[10:06:31] <feinedsquirrel> timanog: Right, so you were just making sure I was aware it adds a bit more computation every time I open a new emulator? susi: I was thinking of doing something along those lines, and separating out keybinds into one more.
[10:06:58] <tirnanog> feinedsquirrel: I'm not sure what I said that you're responding to exactly.

[10:07:16] <tirnanog> feinedsquirrel: the point was that's it just code. which file it was read from doesn't change that.
[10:07:36] <tirnanog> at least, not where you're sourcing into the current shell.
[10:07:59] <rcf> The act of sourcing the file isn't going to hurt performance too badly. What is in said file usually matters quite a bit more, and can actually bog down your system. 
[10:08:02] <tirnanog> executing a script would be a different matter, as that entails spawning a brand new shell to interpret it.
[10:08:04] <feinedsquirrel> OOhhhh, haha, yeah, got it. I mis-read. all good

[12:44:31] <dottorblaster> hello :) sorry to interrupt any discussion, I noticed a couple of outdated packages in [community] and I really want to help maintaining them, but applying as a TU just doesn't feel right to me because you've never heard my name before most probably. So, can I report elixir and newsflash packages outdated and send PKGBUILDs to someone, or something like that? Would you help me figure out this
[12:44:33] <dottorblaster> dilemma? :-D
[12:45:06] <Khorne> dottorblaster, anyone can become a TU if qualified, but reaching out to the maintainer by mail with patches and tests is a good way
[12:45:51] <dottorblaster> Khorne: cool, will try, thanks a lot!
[12:46:15] <BrainDamage> if it's patches, you can append them to the bug tracker or send them by email
[12:46:22] <Khorne> dottorblaster, if its only a pkgver bump, spare yourself the effort though :P
[12:46:56] <dottorblaster> for newsflash it is not, it replaces also some deps, it's trivial enough but you know... :D

[12:47:44] <dottorblaster> Khorne: is "it builds on my machine"(tm) a valid feedback? Or do I risk to be told to f' myself? :-D
[12:47:46] <BrainDamage> testing if it builds and runs locally can be helpful too fwiw
[12:48:11] <Khorne> ^ and I don't think any maintainer would tell you to fuck off, at worst they ignore you :')
[12:48:56] <Khorne> dottorblaster, fwiw, elixir has a new version in the testing repo already
[12:49:19] <dottorblaster> oh ok, thanks! Then I'll go just to the maintainer of newsflash actually

My project that I am working on stopped compiling after the last 'pacman -Syu' and one of the problems is that cmake stopped adding `-pthread` as compile flag even though I use target_link_libraries(libcwd_utils_ObjLib PRIVATE Threads::Threads)
[18:44:12] <CarloWood> Or stopped - I don't know. That argument isn't there anymore anyway.

[22:25:26] <salkin> thanks dondon, any two cents is appreciated here :) im mostly doing realtime audio stuff, video/graphics, compiling c++/rust. On my workstation and laptop. So those is my main interest. I was just blown away by the bench of ZFS. Like its several times faster than Btrfs and Ext. So i guess ZFS performs well in a audio/video production context. Huge i/o.

[23:19:01] <CarloWood> Ok, network is up. I am pretty sure I never used networkctl in my life before!
[23:19:53] <CarloWood> but next problem (must also be related to removing the usb pci, because that work even today still when for some reason the reboot worked one time)
[23:20:04] <Betal> This week a loaded by mistake vfio-pci and called virsh nodedev-detach pci<id> in a NVME drive that had lvm/root, after this the kernel changed the letters/blockdevices of most drives and I got a ton of lvm/ext4/btrfs errors, for example, /dev/sdc wasn't there anymore, when I reloaded the modules back, it changed to /dev/sdj, lvm could not load /dev/sdj  because it throught that the PV was
[23:20:06] <Betal> already loaded (same PV IDs) with errors like PV /dev/sdi1 8:129 is duplicate for PVID YhbQb6GFYxQmfMewcKkbIezn6CLrAh2i on 8:49 /dev/sdd1.
[23:20:18] <CarloWood> (EE) no screens found   when running 'startx'
[23:20:22] <Betal> is this expected to happen when we remove the root device? or it can be a but with systemd/lvm/kernel
[23:20:31] <Betal> s/but/bug
[23:20:46] <dondon> CarloWood: you got it?
[23:20:56] <dondon> next time, if you don't know what device you have plugged in
[23:21:02] <dondon> just type networkctl
[23:21:12] <dondon> and see which device has 'carrier'
[23:21:33] <dondon> or you can type for i in /sys/class/net/enp*/carrier ; do printf '%s\t%s' "${i}" "$(cat "${i}")" ; done ; echo
[23:21:47] <dondon> then use https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-networkd#Wired_adapter_using_DHCP to configure
[23:21:48] <phrik> Title: systemd-networkd - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[23:21:57] <CarloWood> I will make a README about all this :)
[23:22:41] <CarloWood> As soon as I can use my PC again... now I got (EE) No devices detected.  Strange in itself... why on earth would that happen.

[23:23:42] <CarloWood> I remember a remark that I got during pacman -Syu ... something that you should run when running into nvidia troubles.
[23:23:43] <dondon> oh there should be a \n in that one-liner, but you probably won't use that anyway. typing `networkctl` alone will get you there if you're using networkd
[23:24:34] <CarloWood> dondon: I got the network running now, I used 'man networkctl' - it didn't show carrier though until after I tried to bring it up
