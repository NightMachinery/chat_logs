[01:25:47] <videstruggler> hi I already had questions yesterday, about videos not being able to seek through mp4 videos in browser
[01:25:47] <videstruggler> I found out it has to do with the audio stream (same video without audio is no problem), and it could be a firefox only problem
[01:25:48] <videstruggler> has anyone experience with firefox and aac (haven't found anything which helped me)
[01:25:48] <videstruggler> this is not seekable: https://pastebin.com/zXqFQDvm
[01:25:49] <videstruggler> this is seekable: https://pastebin.com/nnuGUK4H
[01:25:49] <videstruggler> (I hope I'm sending the correct one this time ... not like yesterday)
[01:26:50] <videstruggler> is it the 124 kb/s vs 128 kb/s
[01:26:50] <videstruggler> or is it the 5.1 channels vs 6 channels

[18:36:42] <hiya> h264, h265, vp8 and vp9 | does ffmpeg include installation of these codecs?
[18:36:47] <hiya> Or are those extra?
[18:37:33] <JEEB> are you talking about decoding or encoding?
[18:38:09] <JEEB> decoding wise all of those are within FFmpeg's libavcodec itself, but for encoding each of those requires an external encoder to be linked against, which would then be wrapped around
[18:38:09] <hiya> JEEB: for playback of content in browser
[18:38:24] <hiya> Firefox looks for ffmpeg
[18:38:33] <JEEB> yes, but it also specifically blocks HEVC f.ex.
[18:38:43] <JEEB> so even if FFmpeg was built with HEVC decoding, it wouldn't attempt to utilize it
[18:38:52] <JEEB> H.264, AAC it would utilize FFmpeg for
[18:38:56] <JEEB> VP8/9 it handles itself
[18:39:06] <JEEB> since it links against libvpx
[18:39:14] <JEEB> and for VP9 it has split the FFmpeg VP9 decoder into its own thing
[18:39:32] <JEEB> so it doesn't utilize "normal FFmpeg" for that since it can just include that decoder within Firefox itself

[18:40:07] <hiya> They suggest compiling ffmpeg and nothing else
[18:40:33] <hiya> but Fedora adds a bunch of other media codecs too.
[18:40:37] *** Quits: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:41:10] <JEEB> if you're using standard Firefox binaries then you would get libvpx for VP8 and the split-out VP9 decoder built into Firefox itself
[18:41:25] <JEEB> thus you need some version of FFmpeg for H.264 and AAC (and I think MP3)
[18:41:33] <JEEB> their wrapper should load 4.4 branch just fine as well
[18:41:55] <JEEB> you just need shared libavcodec etc in standard dynamic library loading location
[18:42:33] <JEEB> so there's no need to go as old as 4.2 unless you're utilizing some ages-old Firefox :P
[18:45:00] <JEEB> so if you have built shared libraries with those features enabled and put it into a place where executables can find them, then unless someone built Firefox specifically with FFmpeg support disabled you should get it loaded :P

[20:18:26] <kepstin> five6433: are you sure 'asetrate' is the filter you want to use? if the original sample rate was higher, that will result in the filterd audio track being longer than the original

[20:21:49] <five6433> actually, this command exactly fixes the pitch
[20:22:15] <five6433> the original sample rate is 32khz and ffmpeg detects it as 48khz... so, by default, the pitch is higher
[20:22:38] <kepstin> is the audio out of sync or just wrong pitch?
[20:22:42] <five6433> just wrong pitch
[20:23:09] <kepstin> because the asetrate filter changes the length of the track (makes it longer) in that conversion, and will make everything out of sync
[20:23:18] <kepstin> if only the pitch is wrong

[20:42:11] <kepstin> so the really weird thing is the "[avi @ 0x148017000] New audio stream 0:2 at pos:1075720 and DTS:0.28s" output
[20:42:13] <another|> diederik: IIRC ffmpg does not parse DVD indexes. you need something that does, like Handbrake or makemkv
[20:42:18] <kepstin> there's actually a second audio track in these files
[20:42:20] <kepstin> in this file*
[20:42:44] <five6433> yeah, that completely baffled me as well, I think the first 0.28s is the "corrupted" bit I was talking about
[20:42:56] <five6433> on video, it looks like noise
[20:43:19] <five6433> the noise gradually disappears in stripes, uncovering the actual recorded video
[20:43:33] <kepstin> hmm. does it work better if you put the "-ss" option before the input filename rather than after?
[20:43:46] <five6433> for the combined command you mean?
[20:43:48] <kepstin> although given the file is not interleaved correctly, i'm not sure how well that would work
[20:43:50] <kepstin> yeah

[20:48:43] <five6433> also, I can confirm that the videos were obtained using the "Video Capture Wizard" on Windows XP, about 10 years ago
[20:49:14] <five6433> I think that's technically "Windows Movie Maker"?
[20:49:36] <another|> five6433: have you tried to set the input sample rate?
[20:50:12] <five6433> I thought that's what I was doing with '-af asetrate=32000'?
[20:50:18] <five6433> or you mean moving it before '-i' ?
[20:50:28] <another|> input options before i
[20:50:50] <kepstin> the "-af" option is a filter, that only works on output. it runs a conversion between input and output
[20:50:59] <five6433> yeah, I just tried and I can confirm the error
[20:51:22] <kepstin> I think you might be able to use "-ar 32000" as an input option (before -i)
[20:51:26] <kepstin> give that a try?
[20:51:42] <five6433> > Option sample_rate not found.
[20:51:43] <kepstin> (and remove the filter)
[20:52:08] <kepstin> ah, right :/
[20:52:25] <kepstin> it's pcm audio, i though that override might have been available. but i guess not.
[20:53:59] <five6433> can I tell ffmpeg to cut out everything before the 2nd audio stream starts?
[20:54:28] <kepstin> not directly, no.
[20:54:29] <five6433> maybe the 2nd stream will be detected as 32kHz, but right now it detects as 48kHz due to the first corrupted bit
[20:54:53] <kepstin> as it is, it should be completely ignoring the second audio track and only using the first
[20:55:09] <kepstin> (unless you use the -map option, ffmpeg picks one audio and one video track by default)
[20:56:20] <five6433> hmm. can I print more info about the 2nd stream it detects (i.e. size, length)?
[20:56:36] <five6433> I tried to force it using '-map 0:2' but it correctly errors saying that there is no stream with #2
[20:56:43] <five6433> (since it really doesn't exist until 0.28s)
[20:57:00] <diederik> another|: ok, thx. I noticed that handbrake found the same info as lsdvd did. Makemkv is a windows program afaik and a quick test with mkvtoolnix(-gui) combined episode 1+2, so it didn't use indices either.
[20:57:54] <kepstin> five6433: you might have to increase the 'probesize' or 'analyzeduration' options in order for ffmpeg to find the other audio stream.
[20:58:07] <another|> makemkv is also available on linux
[21:00:01] <five6433> kepstin: hmm, this still has no matches: ffmpeg -probesize 1000M -analyzeduration 1000M -i "INPUT.avi" -map 0:2 -vcodec copy -acodec copy "FIX3.avi"
[21:00:13] <five6433> (my file is 300MB)
[21:00:19] <diederik> Earlier today I found out that mplayer still does exist and with "mplayer dvd://2 -dvd-device S1D1/ -v -dumpstream -dumpfile S01E02.vob" I was able to separate the 2nd episode. Mediainfo detected the wrong duration in the result file, but it plays (properly) and should be fixed when converting to x264 I assume

[21:01:53] <diederik> ah indeed, there is a linux version :)
[21:02:16] <kepstin> diederik: I usually use the 'dvdbackup' tool for that sort of thing, it can select a particular title/chapter/angle and output it to a continuous vob file that can be used as input to other tools like ffmpeg :)
[21:02:58] <kepstin> five6433: I'm kinda out of ideas, this really is quite a problematic file you've got here :(
[21:03:53] <five6433> ah, tell me about it... I really appreciate all the help though!
[21:04:09] <five6433> so last question - how come the two commands work separately but not together?

[21:04:29] <kepstin> I have no idea. I'd expect the result to be the same
[21:04:43] <diederik> kepstin: I did install that yesterday, but I guess I couldn't get it to work as I also uninstalled it again. Will give it a new try
[21:05:02] <five6433> I see. Oh well, what are two invocations when they take seconds anyway ^^
[21:05:35] <kepstin> five6433: keep in mind that with the two commands you're doing multiple lossy mp3 encodes right now; you might want to select a specific audio codec.
[21:05:58] <kepstin> five6433: maybe use "-c:a pcm_s16le" for the temporary file so it uses uncompressed audio.
[21:05:59] <diederik> I think I couldn't get the --input=DEVICE parameter to work with my .iso file or the directory to which I copied the VIDEO_TS folder to
[21:06:19] <kepstin> diederik: hmm. i use dvdbackup on directories all the time :/
[21:06:55] <kepstin> (if you use it on a directory, you usually need to explicitly pass the "--name" option since it can't get it from the disc)
[21:06:55] <diederik> also tried vobcopy, but that either printed out an error msg or segfaulted
[21:07:39] <kepstin> (it should work on iso files too)
[21:08:37] <five6433> kepstin: can I do '-acodec copy' for the temp file to preserve it too?
[21:08:53] <kepstin> five6433: you can't use audio filters when copying audio
[21:09:14] <five6433> so first I cut 1 second off the video and use acodec copy, then I transform audio
[21:09:24] <five6433> would that maintain my quality?
[21:09:37] <kepstin> five6433: your original audio is uncompressed pcm, so setting the output coded explicitly to pcm_s16le is fine
[21:09:54] <diederik> kepstin: can you give an example command? Because I only get the "Usage: ..." info
[21:10:07] <five6433> oh yes I totally get that, but 'acodec copy' will have the same effect, right? Just so it can be more universal :)
[21:10:16] <kepstin> diederik: ffmpeg -i "INPUT.avi" -vcodec copy -c:a pcm_s16le -ss 0:0:1 -af asetrate=32000 "FIX3.avi"
[21:10:25] <kepstin> er, sorry, wrong person
[21:10:28] <kepstin> five6433: ^^
[21:10:40] <kepstin> five6433: you cannoy use copy with filters.
[21:10:47] <five6433> like this I mean:
[21:10:51] <five6433> ffmpeg -i "$1" -vcodec copy -acodec copy -ss 0:0:1 -y "$tmp"
[21:10:51] <five6433> ffmpeg -i "$tmp" -af asetrate=32000 -vcodec copy -acodec copy "$fix"
[21:10:51] <five6433> rm "$tmp"
[21:11:16] <five6433> sorry, without the last 'acodec copy', that'll be a transcode to aac
[21:11:40] <five6433> ohh i see what you mean, this way I can even avoid the last step transcoding to aac

[21:11:44] <kepstin> five6433: eh... it's possible that having ffmpeg "re-encode" the audio in the first command rather than "copy" it is what's fixing the issue :)
[21:12:10] <kepstin> in the second command you can use whatever output codec you like of course, it's just that you don't want to re-encode using lossy codecs multiple times

[21:13:04] <five6433> final question - what is a modern lossless format/container I can store these videos in?
[21:13:17] <five6433> seems like macOS doesn't like AVIs at all
[21:13:34] <five6433> and neither do most video editing tools
[21:14:04] <kepstin> five6433: well, dv is already lossy, heh. if your goal is compatibility with lots of software, mp4 container probably makes sense
[21:14:08] <diederik> kepstin: I just added -I and then I did see the structure, so I assume I can make the rest work too. thx
[21:14:15] <kepstin> I think you can put dv video into mp4 without recompressing.
[21:14:21] <galad> mov, mxf are common containers in the video editing world
[21:14:34] <galad> dv in mov should be supported fairly well
[21:14:45] <kepstin> note that mp4 and mov are very similar (mp4 is basically the iso standardized version of mov)
[21:16:38] <kepstin> mov would be the period-appropriate container to put stuff from a dv camera into, heh
[21:16:57] <five6433> huh, so, mov works, but mp4 errors with: Could not find tag for codec dvvideo in stream #0, codec not currently supported in container
[21:16:58] <kepstin> can open it up in quicktime on your mac running os 9 then :)
