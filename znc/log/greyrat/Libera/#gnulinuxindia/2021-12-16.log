[10:30:12] <glizzster[m]1> but how do we get there
[10:31:01] <gtlsgamr> This PR was just a documentation change. The inccommand default parameter was changed in the latest neovim update and I didn't know how to fix it. After I fixed it I realised the documentation for it was inadequate so I created a PR to fix it.
[10:31:27] <gtlsgamr> Best way to get into FOSS is contribute, even if it is as little as documentation change
[10:32:02] <glizzster[m]1> i think need to learn english first and then programming
[10:32:15] <glizzster[m]1> 90% of the time i dont understand what is there in documentation
[10:32:46] <relejek[m]> glizzster:  step 1 study the beginner  friendly FOSS repos. use it.
[10:33:02] <gtlsgamr> ^^^
[10:33:33] <glizzster[m]1> relejek[m]: yess :)
[10:37:07] <relejek[m]> glizzster:  neovim is also a good place to start it is very welcoming for new contributors.
[10:39:03] <Arya[m]> relejek[m]: gnu emacs is better

[12:12:13] <Arya[m]> relejek[m]: lol ok
[12:12:34] <Arya[m]> nice
[12:12:36] <Arya[m]> dark mode/?
[12:12:48] <gtlsgamr> dark and light both
[12:12:52] <gtlsgamr> depends on your system preference
[12:12:55] <relejek[m]> gtlsgamr: thsi is litt mah boi.
[12:13:12] <relejek[m]> dark mode and really appealing to eyes
[12:13:18] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr: noice
[12:13:26] <gtlsgamr> dark mode has always been there idk why you guys saw it today
[12:14:28] <relejek[m]> nah. it was light for as well. and my system is always in dark mode. idk why it is detecting it now and showing it me... now.
[12:14:37] <relejek[m]> * light for me as well.
[12:15:04] <gtlsgamr> Try changing system to light now
[12:15:46] <relejek[m]> gtlsgamr: what blasphemy!! i wud nvr 
[12:16:31] <relejek[m]> my eyes r like spoiled princess. i'd nvr torture them with light mode
[12:16:37] <gtlsgamr> Lmao
[12:16:43] <gtlsgamr> you don't know the love that light mode has
[12:16:49] <gtlsgamr> it just feels *heavenly*
[12:21:35] <relejek[m]> nah i am comfortable on the dark side. darthy is a good company at coffee time.
[12:22:11] <relejek[m]> anyways your site does look good in dark mode. now i'd do something same with mine. 
[12:22:13] <Arya[m]> lol
[13:01:26] <NeoVoid[m]> damn phone number is mandatory in epik.com
[13:02:44] <Arya[m]> yeah
[13:02:45] <Arya[m]> KYC
[13:03:05] <NeoVoid[m]> KYC?
[13:04:27] <Arya[m]> know your customer regulations
[13:05:14] <NeoVoid[m]> i used random phone number generator and it works lol
[13:05:24] <NeoVoid[m]> i hope they wont call on it or somthing
[13:10:16] <NeoVoid[m]> bummer they need visa and master card
[13:11:45] <gtlsgamr> Just use cloudflare for yout domain
[13:20:22] <Govindas[m]> phone number is mandatory in cloudflare too
[13:20:23] <relejek[m]> lmao NeoVoid used a 10 digit random numgen
[13:20:54] <Govindas[m]> I'd just use a friend's phone number (is what I'm doing currently)
[13:21:41] <gtlsgamr> No way
[13:21:46] <gtlsgamr> I don't remember usign a phone number
[13:21:47] <gtlsgamr> I am sure
[13:24:33] <Govindas[m]> you're required to provide a phone number when registering a domain, it's required by the law
[13:24:48] <Govindas[m]> if they find that it's wrong number, you can lose the domain
[13:24:54] <gtlsgamr> Oh that's why! I didn't register on cloudflare
[13:25:04] <gtlsgamr> I bought the domain on godaddy long ago then transferred
[13:25:10] <Govindas[m]> interesting
[13:25:16] <NeoVoid[m]> even if i bought a domain then how my github page site will be able to shift to that domain does github have that function? (sorry for the noob question xD)
[13:25:36] <Govindas[m]> you'll need webhosting
[13:25:38] <Govindas[m]> I think
[13:25:51] <Govindas[m]> or just any machine that can run a website
[13:25:55] <relejek[m]> no need for webhosting
[13:25:59] <gtlsgamr> NeoVoid[m]: If you have a static site like me then no need to get hosting
[13:26:02] <relejek[m]> you can use cutom domains with github pages
[13:26:30] <Govindas[m]> also an option, but better to be less dependent on github, it's owned by microsoft after all
[13:26:39] <Govindas[m]> who made the enemy of linux, windows
[13:27:22] <relejek[m]> that's why hosted with codeberg, like arya
[13:27:23] <gtlsgamr> I host on my raspberry pi. But even I have to depend upon cloudflare since my ip doesnt give me open port
[13:27:58] <relejek[m]> or you can choose gitlabs for the same purpose
[13:28:43] <Govindas[m]> gitlab is very annoying
[13:28:46] <Govindas[m]> blocks Tor users
[13:29:06] <relejek[m]> gtlsgamr:  we need to learn form you how to do that. only thing is we can't have port forwarding. or we need cheap static IP from ISP. can cloudflare help?
[13:29:33] <Govindas[m]> there is a program called "cloudflared" with which you can route stuff through cloudflare 
[13:29:44] <Govindas[m]> with it you can do stuff without being able to open a port
[13:30:05] <gtlsgamr> https://hitarththummar.xyz/posts/writings/argo_tunnel_on_pi.html
[13:30:11] <gtlsgamr> relejek[m]: Follow this ;)
[13:30:21] <Govindas[m]> I use it for matrix federation, but I connect to matrix over LAN with my matrix client, for maybe slightly improved privacy with cloudflare
[13:34:21] <NeoVoid[m]> github pages documentation sucks for adding a custom domain
[13:35:42] <relejek[m]> wut. it is pretty straight forward my man
[13:36:38] <relejek[m]> add the your [repo.]username.github.io to CNAME in DNS of your Domain provicer 
[13:36:39] <relejek[m]> Neo Void: ^
[13:37:58] <NeoVoid[m]> i found it in settings of repo
[13:40:32] <NeoVoid[m]> does anyone uses freenom.com here?
[13:41:11] <NeoVoid[m]> there are 0.00 usd priced domains
[13:44:36] <NeoVoid[m]> also they claim its anonymous dns they provide and no ip loging
[13:50:17] <relejek[m]> iNeo Void  i use freenom
[13:50:28] <relejek[m]> just got my free domain relejek.ml
[13:50:53] <relejek[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "also they claim its anonymous..." <- not sure about that but aight ig
[13:51:47] <gtlsgamr> relejek[m]: update your site my ninja!
[13:55:49] <NeoVoid[m]> mere grah kuch thik nahi hai. whenever i click get domain it says not available
[13:57:55] <NeoVoid[m]> Hello[m]: :(
[13:58:22] <relejek[m]> look for a rare random name. that is easy to remember.
[13:58:56] <relejek[m]> never use anything form dictionary . you won't get those words.
[14:00:33] <relejek[m]> gtlsgamr: just added simple css to it. it should look litt af my boi
[14:00:56] <relejek[m]> sed it only shows me dark mode lul
[14:02:30] <gtlsgamr> which browser
[14:04:51] <relejek[m]> firefox
[14:06:11] <NeoVoid[m]> light chali gayi lul
[14:07:56] <relejek[m]> nope i have changed my firefox's theme to light but the page is still in dark mode. wut!?!?!
[14:08:33] <gtlsgamr> it takes your OS preference 
[14:08:40] <gtlsgamr> not browser preference
[14:11:39] <relejek[m]> fusballs. i am not going in fiddling with my os setting for this.
[14:12:03] <relejek[m]> it work, then it works.
[14:16:07] <relejek[m]> ayee i did it. had go into css and change it from 'dark' to 'light'
[14:16:44] <relejek[m]> sigh no need to fiddle with my OS prefs.
[14:19:58] <Arya[m]> relejek: what records did you add on the dns side?
[14:20:27] <telegram_8037364> <gtlsgamr> "Holy fucking shit.. the governme..." <- it's banned for me too
[14:21:01] <relejek[m]> Arya[m]: it said to just use CNAME but i used everything LOL. why take any chances
[14:21:18] <relejek[m]> still it took like hourse to propogate so you have to be patient
[14:21:38] <Arya[m]> lol
[14:21:51] <Arya[m]> seems all the free domains are from poor african countries lol
[14:21:55] <Arya[m]> other than mali ig
[14:22:01] <relejek[m]> do as it says on codeberg.page
[14:22:38] <Arya[m]> [[branch.]repo.]user.codeberg.page what does this mean lol
[14:22:39] <relejek[m]> does it matter though?
[14:23:15] <Arya[m]> what did you put on the dns side
[14:23:18] <relejek[m]> your website repo need to be in this formate that you'll add as CNAME in your dns settings
[14:23:19] <Arya[m]> a screenshot would be useful
[14:23:26] <Arya[m]> relejek[m]: k
[14:23:31] <relejek[m]> Arya[m]: this ^
[14:24:03] <Arya[m]> ok
[14:24:55] <relejek[m]> gimme your websites's repo Arya 
[14:25:13] <Arya[m]> codeberg.org/aryak/pages
[14:26:40] <gtlsgamr> arya what is your domain
[14:26:44] <gtlsgamr> or url for website?
[14:27:02] <Arya[m]> i have one on freedns
[14:27:03] <relejek[m]> so you need to set " master.pages.aryak.codeberg.page " in your DNS settings as CNAME

[16:26:35] <gtlsgamr> you can google it
[16:26:38] <gtlsgamr> vimium C
[16:27:18] <Hello[m]> <Arya[m]> "why so suddenly lol" <- 1st step towards pro--ing I guess lol.  No man just want to explore stuff and gain knowledge.
[16:27:48] <Arya[m]> ook
[16:28:09] <Arya[m]> i was asking relejek why he was talking about matrix all of a sudden
[16:28:34] <Hello[m]> Arya[m]: Ohh my bad

[16:35:18] <relejek[m]> free email server that would alow me to use my custom domain.
[16:35:32] <gtlsgamr> Never did that before, but I know for sure that gmail option to do this is PAID
[16:36:22] <Arya[m]> zoho offers iirc
[16:37:46] <gtlsgamr> zoho offers, yes.. but very limited
[16:39:12] <relejek[m]> yes they don't give imap to free plan. sad
[16:39:38] <relejek[m]> and they charge 60rs/month for a good enough email service . so sad
[16:39:56] <relejek[m]> it is not expensive but not worth it yet.

[17:23:04] <glizzster[m]1> Arya[m]: the plan was, i will ask your age - you will say you are in high school - i will say "wait they teach you programming in high school?" - you will say yes - i will say "damn dude, you are lucky in my school they still teach us ms pain - you will say oh well thats sad - then i go cry

[17:26:38] <Arya[m]> sla[m]12: noice
[17:26:50] <klimi[m]> Arya[m]: The best would be so they would teach you in school and you would invest time even outside school for the class
[17:26:56] <glizzster[m]1> we still type jana gana mana in ms excel in our school lmao
[17:27:23] <glizzster[m]1> and they use windows xp in all their pc's
[17:27:31] <Arya[m]> for me win 7
[17:27:34] <Arya[m]> atleast until 2020
[17:27:36] <glizzster[m]1> and all of them have 128 mb of ram
[17:27:42] <relejek[m]> just learn to work with terminal and vim/emac
[17:27:44] <Arya[m]> idk what happened in 2020 april and above
[17:27:51] <relejek[m]> may be python or JS
[17:27:53] <glizzster[m]1> relejek[m]: vs code T_T
[17:28:01] <relejek[m]> that's enough for a 10grader
[17:28:02] <klimi[m]> relejek[m]: Emacs is quite ram hungry... Will it run on 128mb?
[17:28:04] <Arya[m]> glizzster[m]1: xDD
[17:28:11] <Arya[m]> klimi[m]: yes
[17:28:18] <Arya[m]> if you use default gc
[17:28:19] <klimi[m]> How?
[17:28:24] <sla[m]12> glizzster[m]1: pirated ?
[17:28:27] <klimi[m]> My emacs uses 400mb
[17:28:33] <glizzster[m]1> bruh they dont even have internet connection so i cant even install a shit

[17:28:38] <klimi[m]> And I haven't even settled up my packages all the way
[17:28:50] <klimi[m]> Arya[m]: What's gcmh? I am talking about emacs
[17:29:12] <Arya[m]> garbage collector magic hack
[17:29:12] <glizzster[m]1> klimi[m]: gnu cat moaning hard i guess
[17:29:13] <Arya[m]> its a package for emacs
[17:29:21] <Arya[m]> that vastly improves performance
[17:29:26] <Arya[m]> by setting gc dynamically
[17:29:27] <relejek[m]> glizzster:  wut shit. how is that possible. do they even make that ram
[17:29:36] <Arya[m]> osmething around those lines

[17:34:09] <SurajKushwah[m]> I am always afraid to write what I think. I know I should be real. But I also feel. People might find it cringe.

[17:50:56] <telegram_8037364> Arya[m]: about a year
[17:51:19] <telegram_8037364> maybe more
[17:51:28] <klimi[m]> <relejek[m]> "klimi:  it has become something..." <- Uh....
[17:51:44] <relejek[m]> i am quiet new here Arya 
[17:52:02] <telegram_8037364> last update broke matrix so i deleted ~/.config/Element/
[17:52:06] <klimi[m]> I'm quite new here too
[17:56:05] <relejek[m]> telegram_8037364: i don't use desktop app. it is too heavy for my system 
[17:57:20] <Arya[m]> <relejek[m]> "i am quiet new here Arya..." <- Oh same
[17:57:37] <Arya[m]> I have had a matrix for a while but started really using it only around august
[18:00:36] <relejek[m]> i joined about end of oct ig.
[18:01:16] <telegram_8037364> <relejek[m]> "i don't use desktop app. it is..." <- neochat is getting there, now it atleast let me login
[18:01:52] <telegram_8037364> <relejek[m]> "i don't use desktop app. it is..." <- btw my pc is potato too, 4gb ram
[18:02:26] <Arya[m]> 4 gigs isnt bad
[18:02:44] <relejek[m]> yeah man linux runs smooth 4gigs
[18:03:26] <relejek[m]> its just some s/w are now build so bloated that they hog ram and resources.
[18:03:29] <relejek[m]> heck i can'
[18:03:40] <relejek[m]> can't* do anything about firefox.
[18:03:57] <relejek[m]> it is a lesser evil
[18:04:38] <Arya[m]> its not bad
[18:04:41] <Arya[m]> i have 8 gisgs of ram
[18:05:08] <Arya[m]> i am using 5.8 gigs with schildichat desktop brave firefox and emacs open
[18:05:11] <Arya[m]> on sway
[18:05:29] <Arya[m]> thats 3 browsers plus emacs w/ gcmh 
[18:05:52] <relejek[m]> Arya[m]: seeeeeeeee. what would happen to my poor 4gigs. ded
[18:06:15] <telegram_8037364> Arya[m]: yeah but with matrix and google meet, cant use it without earlyoom
[18:06:36] <telegram_8037364> s/cant/earlyoom/, s/use/is/, s/it without earlyoom/must/
[18:06:49] <Arya[m]> relejek[m]: no
[18:06:57] <Arya[m]> if you run it like a normal person
[18:07:04] <Arya[m]> the computer is actually pretty low spec
[18:07:10] <Arya[m]> it has i3 6th gen
[18:07:15] <Arya[m]> and has a pretty low Mt/Mhz
[18:08:11] <Arya[m]> 2133 mhz isnt that high
[18:09:18] <relejek[m]> telegram_8037364: ooooo new shiny. should i use earlyoom?
[18:09:27] <relejek[m]> have you seen it's benefits on your system.
[18:09:39] <relejek[m]> does it hinders your workflow
[18:10:03] <telegram_8037364> relejek[m]: 2.43gb matrix, librewolf, telegram, +smol progeams like sxiv,nnn,ncmpp....
[18:11:41] <telegram_8037364> if you don't have it you're gonna lost all open programs
[18:11:58] <telegram_8037364> it mostly kills browser tabs
[18:12:24] <klimi[m]> Does anyone use yubikey with pass and uses some repeated service like mbsync or offlineimap?
[18:12:53] <relejek[m]> 2.6gb with firefox, a small http-server, terminals, transmission, all this above base system
[18:13:46] <relejek[m]> ‚óç‚óè‚óç:  for that is use dicard tabs addon of firefox. it freezes unused tabs
[18:14:20] <relejek[m]> yet i'll give it a spin if it saves my firefox from crashing someday.
[18:14:52] <telegram_8037364> relejek[m]: its more simple , written in c. and can kill process other than browser tabs
[18:14:59] <telegram_8037364> * browser tabs if not available

[20:13:27] <telegram_1960104> Ex-Google TheTechLead takes you and his mechanized dog Sunny on a walk to answer your #1 question. But the answer to Life is not so simple as "Linux." Don't get me wrong -- Linux is my choice for web & database backend servers. But, don't confuse a backend for a frontend -- unless the only thing you care about are backends.
[20:13:27] <telegram_1960104> The funny thing is, as soon as you tell me (and quite proudly, I might add) that you primarily run Linux, I already know a ton about you. I know that you have no artistic ability -- that you're not into full-stack or front-end dev (no photoshop), you're not a photographer (no lightroom), and you're not into video editing (no premiere). I know you're not a software entrepreneur, as you would have needed full-stack development for
[20:13:27] <telegram_1960104> that. I know you're not into remote collaboration with Google Drive (and Dropbox support is being ended soon). I know you're not an iOS developer (no XCode), or mobile developer at all (which generally requires Photoshop). I know you haven't honed your UX/product sense. Even if you dual-boot, I know you're in pain and will probably lose a bunch of data one day and have no idea what happened. You see that? In your search for
[20:13:27] <telegram_1960104> "freedom," you have boxed yourself in like a caged rat.
[20:15:22] <Arya[m]> lol
[20:15:27] <Arya[m]> that guy is a joke

[20:29:11] <gtlsgamr> The fucking log4j is fuckin my shit up. We patched 11 servers JUST a few days ago with a new cyclic patch then this log4j bullshit comes up
[20:29:17] <gtlsgamr> Now we have to patch ALL of them again
[20:29:17] <relejek[m]> start of the video "oh he's taking his dog out for it take a shit" good dog owner. middle of the video "da hek this guy shiting from his mouth, it is supposed to be dogs time to take a shit"
[20:29:22] <gtlsgamr> worst of all, it is windows
[20:29:38] <relejek[m]> yeah what is with log4j stuff
[20:29:38] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr: oof
[20:29:43] <relejek[m]> it all over the news
[20:29:43] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr: absolute rip
[20:30:05] <Arya[m]> relejek[m]: huge vulnerability
[20:30:19] <gtlsgamr> Basically it is a logging library in JAva
[20:30:23] <gtlsgamr> widely used.
[20:30:31] <gtlsgamr> You can use it to run random code in any server.
[20:30:44] <gtlsgamr> So ANYTHING java based that used log4j was vulnerable
[20:30:46] <Arya[m]> ye
[20:31:04] <Arya[m]> if there is an input field where you could type the string
[20:31:12] <Arya[m]> and it was logged with l4j
[20:31:15] <Arya[m]> you are vulnerable
[20:32:04] <relejek[m]> so for a java code that uses log4j lib in it then log4j acts as a keylogger of sorts?
[20:32:12] <relejek[m]> am i getting this right?

[20:32:26] <JB[m]> s/goog/good/
[20:32:52] <Arya[m]> üòÜ
[20:33:01] <Arya[m]> pop?
[20:33:05] <gtlsgamr> not as a keylogger
[20:33:12] <Arya[m]> relejek[m]: it logs the input ig
[20:33:17] <gtlsgamr> but as a place where you can enter malicious code that can run on the server
[20:33:31] <JB[m]> Arya[m]: yes pop_os  they release update and mys system kinda broke
[20:33:42] <Arya[m]> lol
[20:42:16] <relejek[m]> gtlsgamr: aaha so it was first discovered in minecraft. cool culcul cool
[20:43:08] <gtlsgamr> Yes it was

[20:47:26] <Arya[m]> mine lol
[20:47:30] <gtlsgamr> glizzster[m]1: yes, brave. not for the meme, but because it is a good browser after you remove the bullshit
[20:47:57] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr: brave is good but i just prefer firefox for casual browsing
[20:48:14] <gtlsgamr> Arya[m]: Thats a weird ass bar
[20:48:18] <gtlsgamr> what wm is that?
[20:48:22] <Arya[m]> sway
[20:48:23] <Arya[m]> with waybar
[20:48:31] <glizzster[m]1> brave was very fast for me, it worked like charm but the problem was when i use brave my pc temp is like 67 C but when i use firefox its like 40-50 C, so i just prefer furryfox
[20:48:50] <gtlsgamr> Lmao! You look at temperatures?
[20:48:57] <glizzster[m]1> Arya[m]: why sway
[20:49:03] <Arya[m]> its gud
[20:49:13] <Arya[m]> i tried it once liked it and stuck with it
[20:49:38] <glizzster[m]1> gtlsgamr: yes, cuz my pc is 10 years old and has been used for 9 years in offices i care alot about my pc temp, i dont want to break it
[20:49:57] <gtlsgamr> understandable, have a nice day. XD
[20:50:09] <glizzster[m]1> :)
[20:57:02] <gtlsgamr> One thing I thank luke smith for is telling me about xset rate r 300 50
[20:57:08] <gtlsgamr> It changed my life
[20:58:45] <Arya[m]> lol
[20:58:59] <Arya[m]> keyboard and mouse configuration in sway is really easy
[20:59:14] <Arya[m]> you just put it in the wm config file its all well documented 
[21:07:20] <Ankit[m]12> <gtlsgamr> "One thing I thank luke smith for..." <- What it does?
[21:17:43] <gtlsgamr> FUCKING LOG4j GODDADMIT
[21:17:51] <gtlsgamr> They hacked the patch
[21:17:59] <gtlsgamr> so now everything we patched has to be patched again
[21:18:13] <gtlsgamr> I can't imagine the pain developers are going through
[21:18:22] <gtlsgamr> and glad I am not a developer
[21:18:32] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr: rip
[21:18:34] <relejek[m]> how is it even possible to hack the patch so soon?
[21:18:36] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr: lol
[21:18:44] <relejek[m]> i am so sorry for you man
[21:18:54] <relejek[m]> gambbare
[21:19:44] <gtlsgamr> What does that mean
[21:19:55] <gtlsgamr> :(

[21:28:56] <Arya[m]> did they really have to add this to vimiumC readme
[21:35:41] <iamak[m]> Is element an electron app on linux?
[21:36:08] <iamak[m]> Electron apps don't seem to follow the border ruless in dwm 
[21:36:08] <Arya[m]> tw
[21:36:09] <Arya[m]> ye
[21:36:17] <Arya[m]> iamak[m]: border rules?
[21:36:23] <glizzster[m]1> why did the even used electron tho
[21:36:28] <relejek[m]> ‡§è‡§ï‡•á: yup that's a thing element is built on electron.
[21:36:32] <relejek[m]> i don't like it
[21:36:39] <Arya[m]> use neochat
[21:36:44] <Arya[m]> but its not as polished
[21:36:51] <Arya[m]> ig the only good option is ement.el
[21:36:56] <iamak[m]> Arya[m]: `borderpx` variable in `config.h`
[21:37:02] <relejek[m]> i just use browser it is much practicle
[21:37:03] <Arya[m]> oh
[21:37:15] <glizzster[m]1> relejek[m]: yep
[21:37:52] <iamak[m]> iamak[m]: Any idea why this happens only with electron apps?
[21:37:59] <relejek[m]> or you can use matrix cli. 
[21:38:12] <iamak[m]> relejek[m]: Emoji support?
[21:38:24] <Arya[m]> ement :)
[21:40:26] <NeoVoid[m]> Arya[m]: yeah enjoying it so far. üçç
[21:40:43] <Arya[m]> lol it works for you with pantalaimon?

[21:46:48] <Arya[m]> lol wut
[21:47:12] <NeoVoid[m]> <Arya[m]> "lol it works for you with..." <- i didn't tried encryption yet
[21:47:18] <Arya[m]> oh 
[21:47:24] <Arya[m]> that was a big issue for me
[21:47:26] <NeoVoid[m]> but in documentation it said so
[21:47:55] <NeoVoid[m]> Encrypted room support through Pantalaimon
[21:47:55] <NeoVoid[m]> Ement.el doesn‚Äôt support encrypted rooms natively, but it can be used transparently with the E2EE-aware reverse proxy daemon¬†Pantalaimon. After configuring it according to its documentation, call¬†ement-connect¬†with the appropriate hostname and port, like:
[21:47:55] <NeoVoid[m]> (ement-connect :uri-prefix "http://localhost:8009")
[21:48:32] <Arya[m]> yeah
[21:48:37] <Arya[m]> it was very weird
[21:48:40] <NeoVoid[m]> Arya[m]: didn't this worked for you?
[21:48:41] <Arya[m]> couldnt figure iot out
