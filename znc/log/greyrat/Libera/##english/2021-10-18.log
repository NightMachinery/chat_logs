[02:43:37] <stormdancer> guys help, i was answering a question and i got the question wrong because i understood ˜stand still" as not moving. the writer wanted it to mean the position <upright> instead. is it that clear by this writing? "His pain resolves after resting for a few minutes, but it recurs when he returns to work. He also reports that his pain is improved by standing still."
[02:45:53] <twb> stormdancer: your reading makes more sense to me
[02:46:07] <twb> 'standing still' as opposed to jumping about, walking, running, playing football, &c
[02:46:20] *** Joins: mickey8 (~user@user/mickey)
[02:46:26] <twb> But it does also imply not lying down, sitting
[02:47:21] <stormdancer> hmm, I didn't know that the upright position was implied.
[02:47:32] <stormdancer> maybe that's why
[02:47:54] <stormdancer> seems so subtle 
[02:48:09] <twb> stormdancer: "standing"
[02:48:36] <twb> stormdancer: a related usage does not, for example you can describe a car as being "at a standstill"
[02:49:05] <stormdancer> yeah, obviously. i think i've learned this word wrong and kept it wrong for long years. in my head, i just translated it as not moving, regardless of one`s stance
[02:49:06] <stormdancer> thank you
[02:50:06] <twb> I _think_ the stillness is more important

[04:47:10] <kurahaupo> stormdancer: I think you're on the right track with "stand still" being primarily about lack of locomotion. Whether posture can also be read into it would depend on context; for example I would be quite happily use "standing still" to describe someone in a wheelchair. If I meant completely motionless in all respects then I would simply say "still".
[04:47:51] <kurahaupo> "not moving about" as distinct from "not moving"
[04:50:15] <kurahaupo> If I meant motionless and upright, I would insert a comma and/or a conjunction: He's standing, and still.
[04:51:34] <kurahaupo> or His only relief from pain to stand and be still99,99.
[04:52:39] <kurahaupo> Stand on its own means both upright and not locomoting.

[04:54:16] <stormdancer> Jong: no
[04:54:44] <Jong> I read that word when reading something today, and I thought to myself, "why do people use words that they must know many others won't understand or know"
[04:54:55] <Jong> the word shouldn't exist
[04:55:04] <stormdancer> kurahaupo: hmm, thank you for your input. As I am not native speaker, and got this question wrong, it made me concern that I was missing something important. 
[04:55:37] <Jong> if it's rarely used to the point that half the people in your audience don't know what it means, and the word can be replaced with others, there's no reason for the word to exist!
[04:58:02] <stormdancer> Jong: hmm, as long as the writer does not do it too often that it disrupts my reading experience, I don't mind that much. I like the diversity of words. 
[04:58:34] <stormdancer> even when I am reading in my mother tongue, I need to check for meanings all the time.
[04:58:39] <Jong> I disagree. There's too many words in the dictionary
[04:58:46] <Jong> no one uses the word "sate"
[04:59:10] <Jong> stormdancer making use of the 5000 most frequent words is enough diversity
[04:59:36] <stormdancer> okay. that is your opinion. 
[04:59:43] <kurahaupo> Jong: sate root verb of satisfy
[05:01:18] <kurahaupo> Jong: The problem is that sticking to words that everyone already knows means an ever diminishing pool of words, and a loss of nuance and expressive power
[05:01:33] <Jong> Pulling words out of the abyss of forgottenness is an act done only by misguided individuals who believe that doing so will impress others.
[05:02:06] <kurahaupo> How should I know what words you've forgotten? 
[05:02:25] <stormdancer> lol
[05:02:42] <Jong> kurahaupo do you know, without searching online, how the word sate differs from satiate?
[05:03:00] <kurahaupo> I don't go to the dictionary to pick a new word, I use a word like "sate" because there are existing idioms that use it and I've already heard them

[05:03:35] <kurahaupo> I know which of those words I would use in different contexts
[05:04:11] <kurahaupo> sate applies to hunger or desire; satiate applies to a person  or animal
[05:04:27] <kurahaupo> as a rule of thumb
[05:04:58] <kurahaupo> also "satiate" implies "to excess"
[05:05:14] <kurahaupo> don't need a dictionary for any of that

[05:12:44] <kurahaupo> Jong: do those help?
[05:13:52] <Jong> That helps, but I'd need many more examples to feel comfortable using the word myself
[05:17:13] <kurahaupo> "sate" has a sense of "resolved" whereas "satiate" has a sense of "stuffed (over) full"

[15:31:07] <henk> hi, I’m looking for a word. I’m talking about a kind of system that exists in multiple environments. I want to clarify that all systems of that kind in all environments are meant. The words “include”, “cover”, “embrace” come very close but are not quite a good fit IMHO. “encompass” sounds a bit too fancy for my taste. Any recommendations what I could use instead?
[15:31:39] <Voxel> interrelated?

[15:37:31] <henk> Voxel: Thanks but I don’t see either of them working in that context. Which is probably indication that my explanation is bad. I’ll try to be more concrete: I’m saying something like: »Monitoring Systems – You are supposed to look at them and handle whatever problem they are reporting. Note: This “encompasses” all monitoring systems, in all environments, as well as the meta-monitoring system.«
[15:37:33] <henk> “encompasses” is the word that seems to fancy. I could probably just rephrase this to say »Note: This refers to all monitoring systems …«
