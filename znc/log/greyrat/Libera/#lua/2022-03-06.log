[04:58:42] <caoliver> sham: I still wish we had a lightweight aggregate like a cons cell and a macro-friendly parenthesis syntax.
[04:59:21] <caoliver> Sometimes I wonder if those could be kluged into Lua without paying a huge price.
[05:08:25] * technomancy coughs
[05:11:10] <fcr> caoliver: there's always the option of using metalua
[05:11:48] <technomancy> caoliver: depending on what counts as a "huge price"; fennel is ~4kloc with zero runtime overhead. gives you paren syntax but no cons cells on account of the zero runtime overhead bit.
[05:17:42] <caoliver> An interpreter on top is always a bit of a compromise.
[05:18:08] <caoliver> You have to deal with the eccentricities of TWO languages rather than just one.
[05:18:32] <caoliver> Classic examples are the things build on top of JVM.
[05:20:23] <caoliver> What I meant specifically was adding a Scheme style syntax and cons to the Lua engine itself.  I.e. a distinct dialect replacing the conventional one.
[05:22:39] <technomancy> it's not an interpreter
[05:22:54] <technomancy> the runtime semantics are identical
[05:23:01] <caoliver> You're generating VM byte code directly?
[05:23:34] <technomancy> well, going thru lisp->lua->bytecode and then optionally jitted to machine code, yeah
[05:23:42] <technomancy> not directly but that's where it ends up
[05:23:59] <caoliver> What I meant by cost is that I don't want to eat any additional cost in the translation than with typical lua.
[05:24:16] <technomancy> haha, well, you'll never get macros then =)
[05:24:27] <technomancy> can't have one without the other
[05:24:36] <caoliver> You have an additional language layer.
[05:24:41] <caoliver> I understand that.
[05:24:52] <technomancy> there's no runtime cost but there has to be a compile-time cost
[05:25:09] <caoliver> I just am very allergic to compilers that target HLLs.
[05:25:21] <caoliver> I just don't think that's the right thing(tm).
[05:25:41] <technomancy> well, there's different ways to do it. if the runtime semantics remain the same then the cost is very low.
[05:25:54] <caoliver> The idea is to completely ditch Lua syntax.  (I know that's a heretical concept here.)
[05:26:05] <technomancy> it doesn't have to be like moonscript that adds a bunch of new runtime things beyond the compiler
[05:26:23] <technomancy> nah there's plenty of people who agree and indeed; I've spent the last 4 years doing that
[05:26:57] <caoliver> You might accept that you have a slight bias in opinion here.
[05:27:12] <technomancy> I only brought it up because you asked
[05:27:45] <caoliver> I know.  You do understand that I'm asking about a C level implementation rather than a lua glue-on.
[05:28:10] <technomancy> no, I didn't know that until after you said it =)
[05:28:54] <caoliver> The intent is to preserve the performance of the LuaJIT engine (what I use), but with macros and an IMNSHO superior syntax.
[05:29:20] <technomancy> ok, well, hope you find what you're looking for
[05:29:48] <caoliver> I probably won't, but I'm just curious if there are insurmountable problems with this idea.
[05:30:20] <caoliver> I.e. did I do the language equivalent of wanting to solve the halting problem.
[05:30:27] <technomancy> I imagine the main problem is that writing a compiler that emits lua directly is dramatically easier so people do that instead =)
[05:31:24] <caoliver> My big issue is that it penalizes runtime code generation.  The nice thing about lua is that the compile is very cheap, and I want to keep it that way.
[05:31:46] <technomancy> well, I've been doing it for 4 years and that's never once been a problem
[05:32:09] <caoliver> That's because you're willing to live with it.  It might be slight, but it exists.
[05:32:31] <technomancy> I have a laptop from 2008 and I've never even noticed compile times outside the test suite
[05:33:37] <caoliver> That's not the point.  The point is to have that syntax but optimally.  If you have a layer on top of lua, then it is possible to make something lighter weight.

[05:34:00] <technomancy> all right; I get the idea, you don't like it. I'll shut up.

[05:38:19] <technomancy> cool story bro

[05:42:52] <Albright> I would like Lua but with curly braces, strong types, and "&&" and "||" instead of "and" and "or". But I guess that wouldn't be Lua then.
[05:43:55] <caoliver> No.  Lua is almost a lisp, but with IMNSHO worse syntax.

[05:44:33] <caoliver> I do use it because it's very light on resources, and it's trivial to glue to C.
[05:47:33] <nmz> you can use moonscript
[05:47:44] <nmz> I don't think anybody should be writing lisp in this day and age
[05:48:27] <fcr> +1, lisp is basically a write only language
[05:48:47] <fcr> (like so many others)
[05:49:03] <furq> just like lua's syntax
[05:49:28] <furq> i said that at a bad time i mean you should just like lua's syntax
[05:49:36] <furq> it's much less effort than all this
[05:49:59] <caoliver> Lisp *can* be clearly written.  "There has never been, nor will there ever be, a language in which it's the least bit difficult to write bad programs."
[05:50:52] <caoliver> Frankly, if it weren't for the weight, I'd gladly use Smalltalk, Lisp, or Scheme instead.
[05:52:01] <caoliver> That LuaJIT2 is small enough to stuff into a rescue initramfs is a big selling point.  I can't say that of my traditional high level languages.
[05:53:05] <caoliver> furq, why should I "just like" that syntax.  There are definite drawbacks if you want to do Lisp style metalinguistic programming.
[05:53:33] <caoliver> s/metalinguistic/metasyntactic/
[05:53:39] <caoliver> Sorry.  Oops.
[05:55:35] <Albright> Checked out Moonscript. It seems to be adding features to Lua but none of the ones I care about. :/
[05:55:45] <caoliver> nmz: you must have been exposed to some very poorly written Lisp.  I've seen all shades of ugly in multiple languages, hence my allusion to Flon's law.

[06:16:16] <Albright> I wouldn't mind a bit of syntactic sugar around the current approach which is kinda hard to wrap my head around, but not as much as I want strong types

[06:18:39] <technomancy> furq: it's really not as much effort as you probably think. the whole parser is only 300 lines.
[06:19:22] <technomancy> pretty straightforward honestly; you could probably read thru the core compiler pipeline in an hour or two

[20:04:28] <furq> Let AWS' Alex Damarjian guide you through the details of this new open-source project.
[20:04:35] <furq> sorry i can't use anything with such shit apostrophes
[20:05:43] <bomb> it's the American way
[20:06:05] <furq> no it is not
[20:06:28] <furq> americans are even more finicky about it than real english speakers
[20:06:35] <furq> just usually in a wrong way
[20:06:48] <furq> but on this we are in accord
[20:08:16] <bomb> how do you pronounce AWS' in English? ausses or a-w-s-es?
[20:08:29] <furq> a double you esses
[20:08:57] <furq> as a general rule if you say -es then you put 's
[20:10:24] <bomb> so if it's written like Gauss' you'd just say gauss and not gausses?
[20:10:37] <furq> if it's written like that then it's wrong
[20:10:40] <furq> so you pay no mind
[20:10:48] <furq> you would say gauss's
[20:10:50] <leonardus> I would only use single apostrophe at the end of the word for plural possessive
[20:10:57] <leonardus> e.g. "the peoples' community"
[20:10:57] <furq> it's not just plural but it's mostly plural
[20:11:03] <bomb> then my English teacher lied to me
[20:11:21] <leonardus> I would spell "Gauss's" and say "gausses"
[20:11:27] <furq> yeah that's correct
[20:11:29] <furq> the canonical exception is xerxes'
[20:11:37] <furq> not that you say that very often
[20:11:59] <bomb> she said it's just ' if the word ends with s, no matter plural or not
[20:12:06] <furq> yeah that's wrong
[20:12:32] <furq> i mean "wrong" it's english orthography it's entirely by convention
[20:13:08] <furq> but the least stupid and most accepted way is to write it as you'd say it
[20:13:12] <bomb> hmm, competing ideas
[20:13:15] <furq> the dogs' house, chris's house
[20:13:16] <bomb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Archive_(punctuation)
[20:14:27] <leonardus> However language by nature constantly changes so if enough people start using apostrophes the "wrong" way, it becomes the "correct" way
[20:14:52] <furq> most people are generally wrong about everything
