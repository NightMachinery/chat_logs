[02:59:35] <xx> why did mozilla decide to use their own custom proprietary format for LZ4 instead of using standard lz4 that every tool can read?
[03:00:00] <xx> I need to read the session restore files, but mozilla makes it a pain
[03:01:32] <Peng> I don't think there was any standard header at the time
[03:03:36] <xx> I'm more inclined it is simply yet another case of mozilla's NIH syndrome
[03:03:41] <xx> but I know I'm rambling
[03:03:51] <xx> I'd simply prefer mozilla to follow established standards
[03:04:45] <Peng> What established standard was there?
[03:05:24] <xx> lz4
[03:05:49] <Peng> There was a standard file format?
[03:06:56] <xx> tools for lz4, for encoding/decoding or catting it to other commands came out in 2011. Mozlz4 came out in 2015. I think.
[03:10:04] <Peng> It was at least as old as 2014, but that's not a big difference

[03:24:45] <Bradipo> JanC: You mean when it tries to remember the last directory you saved a file in?
[03:25:45] <Bradipo> It seems a bit hit and miss for usefuless to me actually.  Sometimes I've been pleasantly surprised by what it remembers, other times, it's just wrong.
[03:27:02] <JanC> except it doesn't remember the last download location but appears it tries to guess some past download location based on the look of tea leaves or some other voodoo
[03:28:46] <Bradipo> Right, like I said, it's a bit hit and miss.
[03:28:49] <JanC> and clearly it failed its clairvoyance final year tests
[03:29:12] <JanC> it's about 90 miss and 10% hit
[03:29:14] <Bradipo> It almost seems like they intended for it to track the download target based on the source website.
[03:29:27] <JanC> just give me the last location, at least that's predictable
[03:29:34] <Bradipo> e.g. if you often go to the same website and download something, it might figure that you want to put the download in the same location.
[03:30:07] <Bradipo> Not sure if it can be disabled.

[21:34:54] <t4nk_freenode> hehe yeah, you guys know that feeling in the stomach when you get a google result for "/home/ede/myBoobPics"
[21:35:47] <ede> nope, there are no pics of my boobs in the profile
[21:43:10] <t4nk_freenode> that's ok man, I don't get aroused by a single loose boob either ;)
[21:43:38] <t4nk_freenode> no, I meant.. my personal boob collection/
[21:43:45] <t4nk_freenode> no my personal boobs ;)
[21:44:03] <t4nk_freenode> makes me wonder... is there another dir on your hd :b
[21:44:38] <t4nk_freenode> *not

[23:24:25] <t4nk_freenode> that made me think of Blackadder's boobs hehe
[23:25:18] <t4nk_freenode> just don't duckduck those... I'm not kidding, the amount of filth that pops up with that search
[23:25:28] <phy1729> don't see how that's at all topical
[23:26:13] * t4nk_freenode votes for a righteousness-badge for phy1729 
[23:26:15] <t4nk_freenode> GOOD MAN
[23:49:45] <nemo> the part that frustrates me the most about the default search is it keeps insistenting on searching for things like internal-server:8080/testproject/somesecret
[23:49:53] <nemo> WTF firefox.  
[23:50:03] <nemo> I mean, yes, I can turn this off, but, I do profile resets a lot
[23:50:09] <nemo> esp on test instances
[23:50:19] <nemo> having this internal stuff flow to google all the time is really irritating
[23:50:30] <nemo> *insisting
[23:50:49] <phy1729> have you considered a user.js to keep settings you like?
