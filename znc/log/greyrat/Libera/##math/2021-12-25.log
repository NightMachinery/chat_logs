[05:25:09] <Z-module> oh, "measure space" vs. "measurable space" ... I'm not sure this distinction is used very much.
[05:26:13] <Decker> - this is a point that I can't answer; I don't beleive in countable infinities :)
[05:26:49] <[itchyjunk]> so cardinality of N is what?
[05:26:55] <[itchyjunk]> uncountable infinite?

[05:28:12] <[itchyjunk]> What does that change?
[05:28:57] <[itchyjunk]> Looks like measure is defined in terms of algebra.
[05:29:10] <Decker> sure you could say uncountable... not to say by counting you can't get there
[05:29:10] <[itchyjunk]> So I guess need to learn what an algebra is first prior to measure theroy
[05:29:25] <[itchyjunk]> It is countable.

[05:29:49] <[itchyjunk]> idk what that is either

[05:47:17] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm
[05:48:13] <isekaijin> For example, f(x) = 0 if x is rational, and f(x) = 1 if x is irrational. Clearly nowhere continuous.
[05:48:13] <[itchyjunk]> for reimann integration, you didn't need continuity all the time anyways, right?
[05:48:17] <[itchyjunk]> can't remember the conditions
[05:48:40] <isekaijin> A Riemann-integrable function f : [a,b] -> R still has to be integrable on most of its domain.
[05:49:09] <[itchyjunk]> has to be cts on most of its domain?
[05:49:20] <isekaijin> Yes.
[05:49:27] <isekaijin> It can have discontinuities, but not that many.
[05:50:34] <[itchyjunk]> ah, so lebesque integral works with nowhere cts? hmmm
[05:51:06] <isekaijin> For SOME nowhere continuous functions.
[05:51:14] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[05:51:16] <isekaijin> Emphasis needed on “some”.
[05:52:08] <isekaijin> Also, Lebesgue integration handles some things more cleanly. You don't need to first define integrals of functions [a,b], and only then generalize them to integrals of functions on the real line using “improper integrals” or whatever.
[05:52:12] <[itchyjunk]> The class i didn't get to take "introduction to real analysis" would have introduced me to measure theory :(
[05:52:31] <isekaijin> functions on* [a,b]

[05:53:02] <[itchyjunk]> hmm thats how we did it (kinda) in complex analysis too..
[05:53:16] <[itchyjunk]> guess you do it differently in C with measure theory as well?
[05:53:19] <isekaijin> You can study complex analysis just fine without knowing Lebesgue integration.
[05:53:31] <isekaijin> But measure theory provides a new point of view on some things.
[05:54:07] <[itchyjunk]> Seems like measure theory give more than reimann
[05:54:23] <[itchyjunk]> Once you know measure theory, is there a reason to go back to reimann ?
[05:55:00] <isekaijin> Yes, namely: You can explain Riemann-integration to calculus students.
[05:55:07] <[itchyjunk]> lol
[05:55:25] <[itchyjunk]> I heard some unis try to start off with measure theory directly
[05:55:49] <isekaijin> If it works for them, then all the more power to them.
[05:56:18] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: the Riemann integrability thing is that the set of discontinuity points of the function has to have measure 0 in [a,b]. But that set can still have "many" points, such as being uncountable in every subinterval.
[05:56:44] <isekaijin> Oh, I meant “not that many” in a measure-theoretic sense, not a set-theoretic sense.
[05:57:04] <Z-module> sure
[05:57:30] <[itchyjunk]> is that saying that the discontinuous points contribute a total of 0 length so we can just integrate the non discontinuous points and still make sense on the function?
[05:57:44] <Z-module> kinda sorta
[05:57:51] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm
[05:58:51] <Z-module> also, such useful things as: a monotone function (from R or from some interval, into R) is automatically differentiable except on a set of measure 0.
[05:59:11] <isekaijin> Cantor staircase!
[05:59:33] <Z-module> So those (in)famous continuous nowhere-differentiable functions, by Weierstrass and others, have to be everywhere infinitely squiggly: there is no interval (x, y) on which they are montone.
[05:59:55] <[itchyjunk]> cantor staircase is differentiable?
[06:00:06] <isekaijin> No.
[06:00:14] <Z-module> just on the open intervals where it is contant
[06:00:27] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[06:00:47] <Z-module> it has derivative 0 almost everywhere, and is non-differentiable everywhere else but this else-set has measure 0.
[06:01:08] <isekaijin> And yet it grows from 0 to 1 on [0,1].

[07:52:07] <biberao> its a cube
[07:52:37] <dude12312414> two cubes stuck together or one cube split in half?
[07:52:38] <biberao> the angle between CA and AB is 45º
[07:52:57] <dude12312414> i guess it doesn't matter anyway
[07:53:20] <dude12312414> but if you know the angle between CA and AB then you can find ||AC|| in terms of AB and AB*CA
[07:53:26] <dude12312414> the way I mentioned

[07:54:22] <biberao> so
[07:54:28] <biberao> stupid question
[07:54:38] <biberao> should i use AC or CA?
[07:55:19] <dude12312414> for the norm it doesn't matter. ||AC|| = ||CA||
[07:55:28] <dude12312414> as vectors, you could argue CA = -AC
[07:55:49] <dude12312414> and for dot products it matters because you get a different sign
[07:56:38] <biberao> so can i do CA.AB=||AC|*||AB||*cos(45)
[07:57:23] <dude12312414> actually it would be more correct to say AC.AB = ||AC||*||AB||*cos(45)
[07:57:23] <int-e> note that AB.CA = -9 is negative, so, no
[07:57:45] <biberao> please explain :D
[07:57:53] <dude12312414> if the angle is acute your dot product is positive, if the angle is obtuse the dot product is negative
[07:58:29] <biberao> im trying to understand that idea specifically
[07:58:41] <biberao> i could do a sum of two vectors to get CA
[07:58:41] <int-e> AB.CA = - AB.AC
[07:58:45] <biberao> but i was wonder this
[07:58:53] <biberao> ok
[07:59:10] <biberao> damn i forgot i had the -9
[07:59:15] <biberao> actually for the same one
[08:00:18] <biberao> but then
[08:00:21] <dude12312414> if you want to visualize it, the angle that you use in the dot product calculation is the one between the lines when translate them so that their starting points are the same

[08:06:18] <int-e> dude12312414: maybe that's because I'm usually seeing vectors in 3D (which can't easily orient angles)

[08:09:11] <greenbagels> so what's the question?
[08:09:21] <greenbagels> something about dot products of vectors inscribed in cubes?
[08:09:47] <biberao> greenbagels: writing norm of AC in terms of norm AB
[08:10:05] <greenbagels> didnt you say its a cube
[08:10:12] <biberao> yes
[08:10:19] <greenbagels> so A, B, C, D are vertices of a square?

[08:11:08] <dude12312414> biberao: and the answer to that is what I mentioned, AB.AC = ||AB||*||AC||*cos(45), or AB.CA = ||AB||*||CA||*cos(135)
[08:11:09] <greenbagels> do you know how the length of the diagonal of a square relates to the length of one of its sides?
[08:11:19] <dude12312414> since you are also given AB.CA = -9
[08:11:40] <biberao> greenbagels: you mean l*sqrt(2)?
[08:11:44] <biberao> l=side
[08:11:47] <greenbagels> ye
[08:12:25] <greenbagels> that would be the synthetic geometry way to tackle it i guess

[08:14:13] <dude12312414> hm
[08:15:00] <dude12312414> yeah knowing AB.AC would be kind of redundant in this case
[08:15:50] <dude12312414> oh
[08:16:08] <dude12312414> actually you probably need both if your goal is to figure out the actual value of ||AB||

[08:17:00] <biberao> help me with this way
[08:17:08] <biberao> btw
[08:17:12] <dude12312414> greenbagels' formula relates ||AB|| to ||AC|| in terms of Pythagoras' theorem but it doesn't provide any clue about the scale
[08:17:23] <dude12312414> the dot product gives the scale
[08:17:37] <int-e> scale?
[08:17:39] <greenbagels> dude12312414: scale as in ?
[08:17:54] <biberao> also
[08:18:11] <dude12312414> i mean if you didn't know the dot product then all sides could be rescaled by an arbitrary factor
[08:18:11] <biberao> is ||AB|| same length as ||DP|| ?
[08:18:14] <biberao> https://postimg.cc/m1zMbmZq
[08:18:31] <greenbagels> but the ratio of the lengths would still be sqrt(2)
[08:19:33] <greenbagels> biberao: i feel like that question is something that depends on how the problem is stated
[08:19:48] <greenbagels> hard to judge just from a picture

[15:04:33] <pingpongball> What are alternatives for Haversine formula of calulcating distance betwen two points given lng lat?
[15:05:03] <isekaijin> cadmio: Then every isometry is contained in a subgroup of E_2 conjugate to O_2.

[18:10:35] <Ox5cfb> i don't think faithfulness matters for tesselation purpose
[18:11:27] <Ox5cfb> you can always reduce the problem to a faithful action by quotienting the group by the kernel of the action
[18:12:37] <riv> ah yes
[18:12:56] <riv> i suppose everything is always tesselated by a group action
[18:13:01] <riv> because you can always partition it into orbits
[18:13:15] <riv> the question is whether you can find a nice representative

[19:00:10] <isekaijin> Mmm. Let's think. Each m-cycle is a product of (m-1) transpositions. Moreover, the order of these transpositions is fixed up to cyclic permutation.
[19:02:21] <isekaijin> That gives a factor of (m_i - 1) coming from each (m_i)-cycle.

[19:08:45] <isekaijin> On the other hand, if we have (m_i - 1) elements labelled i [for 1 <= i <= k], and we temporarily ignore the distinction between any two elements with the same label, then we have multinomial(n - k, m_1 - 1, ..., m_k - 1) ways to write a list containing these elements.
[19:09:32] <cherim> Yes, the multinomial part is OK, cycles are independent. Not to clutter formulas, suppose there is one cycle only.
[19:10:41] <isekaijin> Yeah, maybe I messed up the factor coming from each cycle.

[19:51:46] <isekaijin> But, wait, duh.
[19:51:59] <pingpongball> In first part it used `hav(lamda1-lambda2)`
[19:52:14] <isekaijin> g(n,d) is just n-d
[19:52:24] <pingpongball> and in second when using it in sin ,it uses `lambda2 - lambda1`
[19:52:48] <isekaijin> So f(n) = \sum_{d=1}^{n-1} (n-d) f(d) f(n-d)
[19:53:11] <isekaijin> Also, the factors f(d) and f(n-d) are just flipped if we replace d with n-d.
[19:53:29] <isekaijin> So 2 f(n) = \sum_{d=1}^{n-1} n f(d) f(n-d)
[19:54:09] <isekaijin> So f(n) = (n/2) \sum_{d=1}^{n-1} f(d) f(n-d)

[20:38:49] <cherim> As for the Abel identity path, you can "guess" that it follows from considering the coefficient at xy in (x+y)(x+y+n)^n
[20:38:55] <cherim> But it's way less natural
[20:39:15] <isekaijin> Wait, the product s depends on the order of the factors (ik, jk). But the corresponding graph does not. So what exactly does the graph represent?
[20:39:29] *** Quits: bitdex (~bitdex@gateway/tor-sasl/bitdex) (Quit: = "")
[20:39:44] <cherim> Graph = set of used transpositions
[20:40:03] <cherim> For each n-cycle, there is a unique ordering that yields the given cycle
[20:40:30] <isekaijin> Oh, right, up to cyclic permutation, that's true.

[20:41:02] <isekaijin> Okay, so, if a graph represents a cycle, then it represents a unique one.
[20:41:08] <cherim> Actually, I probably have to be more careful here
[20:41:25] <cherim> As above, I computed the number of all (tree, ordering pairs)
[20:41:40] <cherim> And I know that each n-cycle gets the same number of products
[20:42:06] <cherim> So I can divide and get the answer I needed, but there is no natural correspondence just from what was said

[20:43:43] <cherim> Here's a construction https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0106039.pdf
[20:44:37] <isekaijin> Wait, then my calculation is undercounting something. I get f(4) = 14, but the correct answer is f(4) = 16.
[20:44:39] <isekaijin> And let's see.
[20:45:14] <cherim> 14 suggests you get Catalan instead

[20:45:58] <cherim> Like the multinomial for independent cycles
[20:46:25] <isekaijin> I don't have any binomial factors.
[20:47:04] <cherim> Do you remember where your multinomial(n - k, m_1 - 1, ..., m_k - 1) came from?
[20:47:32] <isekaijin> It came from interleaving the transpositions coming from different cycles.
[20:47:38] <cherim> Why isn't it in  \sum_{d=1}^{n-1} f(d) f(n-d) ?
[20:48:35] <isekaijin> ARGH!
[20:48:37] <isekaijin> Of course.
[20:48:52] <cherim> See the imgur link with Abel again
[20:49:25] <isekaijin> After splitting (1,...,n)(i,j) = (1,...,i,j+1,...,n) (i+1,...,j), I should have used the fact that the transpositions coming from these two cycles can be permuted.

[23:09:11] <somiaj> SineConfusesMe: In the wave sin(kx), if k = 1,2,3,4,5,6,...., then the number of periods in 0 to 2pi is k, so k is often called the wave number

[23:09:22] <somiaj> so in your example, sin(2x), the wave number is 2, which means two waves per standard period

[23:10:20] <somiaj> Yea, I think they are too, it doesn't really have a name directly, but is related to the wave number (that I nkow of)
[23:10:36] <greenbagels> yea i cant say i know of one either
[23:10:50] <riv> hi
[23:10:56] <greenbagels> hi riv
[23:11:11] <SineConfusesMe> ah okay that makes sense. okay let me ask my next question then, sorry it might get hazy since there is no name for what i'm talking aboutg
[23:11:12] <somiaj> It is really asking the same question is what is the wave sin(x) from 0 to 4pi called? I guess you could just say 2-periods of the wave in that interval.
[23:11:16] <riv> What's the moduli space of curves?
[23:11:46] <somiaj> but the wave number in the stndard period is something that is a useful comparision
[23:15:46] <Ethos> Does anyone have experience with maxima?

[23:18:53] <SineConfusesMe> let's say we have frequency f = 256. we make a sine wave out of it y=sin(x*f), so in "length" of 2pi have 256 cycles and my assumption wouid be the period would be 2pi/256. but online calculators such as https://www.sensorsone.com/frequency-to-period-calculator/  are saying period = 1/f which is 1/256   . im confused by the discrepency
[23:21:06] <somiaj> SineConfusesMe: In essence either of those answers could be correct depending on how you want to define frequency, but as you see the wave number and frequency (using the definition there) are not the same thing
[23:21:21] *** Quits: meingtsla (retrograde@user/meingtsla) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:22:03] <somiaj> there they are wanting frequency = number of waves in a single second. So to have 256 waves in a single second, the length of each wave (in time) is 1/256 seconds.
[23:22:27] <somiaj> So here they aren't relating this to the standard period, but wanting a direct ratio between the length of the period, and the number of waves in a single period.

[23:25:31] <SineConfusesMe> sorry what do you mean by wave number and frequency are not the same? isn't frequency the number of cycles (or waves) in a given time frame, in this case 1 second?
[23:25:58] <somiaj> I defined wave number as k in sin(kx)
[23:26:12] <SineConfusesMe> also when making a sine wave, there is no such thing as seconds right? if i want seconds, i have to multiply the number of seconds by 2pi right?

[23:29:19] <somiaj> hence, explaining the difference between the two answers you got. It just matters on units you want to measure things in vs what value do you have to put in the sin(k x) for the wave.
