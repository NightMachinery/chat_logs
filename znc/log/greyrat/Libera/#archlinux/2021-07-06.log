[00:54:01] <mar77i> I thought I had solved all of them but didn't. I compiled the list of pkgs in the editor and replaced newlines with nothing, ending up with a bunch of concatenated package names xD
[00:54:23] * mpan teaches mar77i about xargs.

[00:55:00] <mar77i> kek. I had copied the package list from the broken terminal.
[00:55:18] <mar77i> does pacman take package names as they're listed by pacman (including version)?

[03:29:46] <Scimmia> no, because that was the version in the database, it's not a versioned dep
[03:30:02] <mingdao> Updating the system upgraded libdrm 2.4.106-1 -> 2.4.107-1 which got the poppler 21.07.0-1
[03:30:15] <mingdao> Scimmia: I'm not going to argue with you.

[03:35:05] <mingdao> We need to argue some more semantics, though.
[03:35:17] <mingdao> Rather than looking at bugs.
[03:35:20] <Scimmia> the fact that poppler was updated about three and a half hours ago, and the fact that updating fixed it means that I did ascertain that

[03:37:15] <moonshine> well, rather than the snark it would have been useful to just say that, as in, i checked osbeck for the correct version of poppler, and it's there, your database is out of date. but that's not how you addressed it.

[03:37:58] <moonshine> and i don't know if you checked if the database on osbeck is current.  being that it's two separate things.
[03:38:14] <Scimmia> I didn't, and guess what, it didn't matter

[05:28:25] <mpan> jokulhaups: by knowing, which piece of software delivers the file. Under normal circumstances you should be informed, what are dependencies of a program you want to built/ue.
[05:28:28] <mpan> *use
[05:28:51] <jokulhaups> yeah this is normally not a problem ofc
[05:29:27] <mpan> Neither Arch nor any other distro can magically solve the problem of someone not providing you with the information they should. :D
[05:29:29] <jokulhaups> I'm just running some SDK installer from Garmin that probably makes some assumptions about my system
[05:29:42] <jokulhaups> no mention of this dependency
[05:29:50] <jokulhaups> haha truth
[05:30:24] <jokulhaups> but I have found I sometimes run into this problem of some software wanting some very specific shared library with no more information
[05:30:25] <mpan> Then Garmin should provide information on what are the dependencies, in which versions.
[05:31:44] <mpan> Otherwise you can only search the web for the file name. Possibly without the version info, which may also work with distro-specific package managers (incl. Arch) and tools (like pkgfile), if the distro has that dependency, but in a different version.

[16:47:13] <Tom^> oh right gotta update sx :p
[16:49:35] <niki> tomty89: No exit is not the last thing that is run, since you can trap on EXIT
[16:51:17] <niki> But i don't actually know what happens if you do that :)
[16:51:52] <raster> earnestly: actually ... i wonder. if you use trap to trap signals, is there a tiny race condition between exit and the shell actually exiting when it could run a signal handler trap after exit... i never looked how bash and friends handle signal traps.
[16:52:01] <tomty89> earnestly: what i mean is, it seems now in the new version that you find ot unimportant to "retell" sx what signal it actually got that made it cleanup, with SIGINT as the only exception
[16:52:13] <earnestly> raster: Yeah, there's races everywhere with signals
[16:52:16] <raster> niki: hahaha i was thinking traps too :)
[16:52:52] <earnestly> None of these operations are atomic, even checking the pid and using kill introduces a race
[16:53:12] <raster> earnestly: yeah. they are nasty. i ended up serialising signals into events in the main loop of my c code because handling them IN a signal handler is a nightmare, so instead use eg.. signalfd or do your own pipes etc. to get some sanity...
[16:53:34] <tomty89> earnestly: and i'm wondering why it matters for it / the caller to know wjat the signal was *when and only when* it was SIGINT
[16:53:36] <earnestly> pidfd might help too
[16:54:06] <earnestly> tomty89: Because resending sigint upon receiving it is good manners
