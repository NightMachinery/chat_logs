[00:10:29] <cis> I'm thinking abou re-doing mine with a static site generator instead of having to maintain a backend with database
[00:10:31] <pulse> be warned though they can a good chunk of profits off your product
[00:11:16] <pulse> pyzozord, there's also itch.io for games, play store for android, apple store and so on. if you build a strong portfolio clients get attracted to it
[00:11:36] <pulse> even if you have a strong portfolio of foss projects on github
[00:12:47] <pyzozord> pulse: on codecanyon what kind of code/scripts/pluggins is the most in demand? I thought maybe I could learn webgl and do some fancy 3D work

[00:12:56] <pulse> you will need some creativity and determination to start with
[00:13:07] <pulse> by far the most in demand are wordpress themes
[00:13:13] <pyzozord> (hmm although that would probably require learning a whole lot of trigonometry and a shader language)
[00:13:15] <pulse> some people earn millions passively just through that
[00:13:51] <pulse> https://themeforest.net/item/avada-responsive-multipurpose-theme/2833226
[00:13:55] <pulse> see extended license price for this
[00:14:02] <pulse> plus support
[00:14:07] <pulse> about $4k per customer
[00:14:14] <pulse> some % off to envatomarket
[00:14:25] <pulse> you get maybe what $3k at that level

[00:15:53] <pulse> eyynet4, it's far more than just HTML but yes
[00:16:22] <pyzozord> isn't that like with the mobile app market, pretty much a lottery if you get noticed?
[00:16:22] <pulse> anyway pyzozord i'm not saying you should do either but you can browse through products on that site for a while to get an idea of what sells and what doesn't
[00:16:37] <pulse> pyzozord, maybe. maybe not.

[02:07:00] <Izem> well yeah, but you can do that with just errors no?
[02:07:58] <pyzozord> I'm not sure but I think exception can handle more then your code could, like divide by 0 exceptions and other lower level things
[02:08:08] <pyzozord> of course you could code in manual checks every time you do a division
[02:08:20] <pyzozord> but that doesn't seem realistic
[02:08:22] <Izem> well those are hardware exceptions, all compilers have to deal with those
[02:08:40] <Izem> iirc J/APL just said 0/0 = 1 or something
[02:09:10] <Izem> you could also prevent that by using types potentially
[02:10:40] <Izem> I'm just a bit skeptic
[02:11:20] <Izem> not like it helps you recover from a kernel panic :P
[02:11:28] <pyzozord> I need to find some articles online disecting exceptions for pros and cons
[02:12:08] <eyynet4> well the first obvious probalem is code bloat
[02:12:29] <eyynet4> less efficient use of icache
[02:12:31] <Izem> rust and zig have some interesting ideas with errors as values
[02:13:04] <Izem> go went the same route as well, ends up being used better

[02:14:20] <pyzozord> ah damn I should have said "what route did go go". What a lost opportunity

[02:15:00] <pyzozord> ah right they just do tuples

[06:29:14] <euouae> karstensrage: I want to "wiretap" a phone call
[06:29:35] <euouae> i.e. call someone and record our conversation

[06:30:06] <euouae> What do you know about it anyway?
[06:30:11] <euouae> What's sketchy is the App Store
[06:30:15] <vdamewood> Makes sense if you're calling tech support for a sketchy company.
[06:31:06] <euouae> You need to ham fist your personal info into some shadowy company with a .biz domain just to hook some audio function

[06:31:41] <euouae> a quick search on google :P
[06:32:05] <karstensrage>  https://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RECORDING-CONVERSATIONS-CHART.pdf
[06:32:22] <karstensrage> Eleven (11) states require the consent of everybody involved in a conversation or phone call before the conversation can be recorded. Those
[06:32:22] <karstensrage> states are: California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Washington.
[06:32:22] <karstensrage> These laws are sometimes referred to as “two-party” consent laws but, technically, require that all parties to a conversation must give consent
[06:32:22] <karstensrage> before the conversation can be recorded.
[06:32:36] <euouae> I don't need you to lawyer up on me, I already have a lawyer I spoke to karstensrage.
[06:32:42] <karstensrage> lolo
[06:32:50] <karstensrage> you sound sketchy as heck sorry
[06:32:57] <euouae> You're a freakin moron how about that?
[06:33:16] <euouae> I'm dealing with a family issue
[06:33:25] <karstensrage> maybe take a chill pill?
[06:33:44] <karstensrage> there are laws easily googleable
[06:33:52] <euouae> This is completely unrelated to what I'm asking about
[06:34:09] <vdamewood> euouae: Please be respectful and friendly.
[06:34:13] <karstensrage> if you are intending to follow the law then i gues call-recorder.biz is as good as any
[06:34:19] <euouae> How is calling me sketchy respectful though?
[06:34:37] <karstensrage> not you specifically, what you are intending to do
[06:34:47] <euouae> How is something legal sketchy?
[06:35:23] <vdamewood> Whatever else has been said, "You're a freakin moron how about that?" is certainly not respectful or friendly.
[06:35:26] <karstensrage> “Wiretapping” involves the use of covert means to intercept, monitor, and record telephone conversations of individuals. It is an unauthorized
[06:35:26] <karstensrage> physical  connection  with  a  communication  system  at  a  point  between  the  sender  and  receiver  of  a  message.
[06:35:51] <karstensrage> you used the word wiretap
[06:35:51] <euouae> I do not intend to wiretap, I'm going to record my own audio call. I used the wrong verb because you misunderstood the first time
[06:36:09] <karstensrage> ok but you have to notify the other party they are being recorded
[06:36:17] <euouae> Not in my state
[06:36:19] <euouae> I don't need your legal advice darn it
[06:37:06] <X-Scale> maybe logging irc channels is also illegal in all those states
[06:37:18] <karstensrage> well this is ##programming, maybe ask about how you should go about writing your own, non-sketchy, completely legal app and get it approved for the app store
[06:37:56] <euouae> ...
[06:38:59] <causative_> https://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RECORDING-CONVERSATIONS-CHART.pdf
[06:39:15] <causative_> 38 states have a one party consent law, 11 states have an all-party consent law
[06:39:53] <euouae> what I wanted to point out is that the App Store on iPhone is subpar when it comes to recording your own voice
[06:39:54] <karstensrage> were so us centric here, shame on us :P
[06:39:57] <causative_> if you're in a state under the one party consent law, it would be legal.
[06:40:08] <causative_> under the all-parties consent law it would not
[06:40:19] <causative_> unless you notify them
[06:40:24] <karstensrage> causative_, read about nevada
[06:40:35] <causative_> that's one of the 11
[06:40:53] <karstensrage> nope
[06:40:57] <karstensrage> read it
[06:41:01] <causative_> I read it
[06:41:14] <causative_> supreme court of nevada interpreted it as all-party consent law
[06:41:27] <karstensrage> yeah
[06:41:34] <karstensrage> but they have one party on the books
[06:41:48] <euouae> wiretapping is legal in Colorado according to what I read

[07:41:14] <vin> I am concerned about performance and atmoics might lead to bus locks
[07:41:58] <Arahael> vin: I'd just use a thread-safe queue.
[07:43:04] <vin> My producers need to notify consumers that they are doing a task. Number of producers and consumers are not equal
[07:43:17] <vin> how can you notify with a queue?
[07:43:25] <vin> Arahael:
[07:44:32] <Arahael> As in, backpressure?
[07:44:40] <vin> Yes
[07:44:53] <Arahael> Some queues for this will implement that.
[07:44:57] <Quietwalker> In general, you set up a registration/event listener construct to handle something like that.  Implementation details are language or framework specific, but, the producer should have an endpoint to register methods to call in the case of a given event.  Consumers should then register themselves as listening for that event.
[07:45:15] <Quietwalker> When the event occurs, the producer sends the same arguments to each of the registered methods.
[07:46:00] <Quietwalker> that allows the consumer objects to 'own' the processing they want to do and allows the producer to remain ignorant of the consumer internals.
[07:46:47] *** Quits: hexfive (~eric@50.35.83.177) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0)
[07:47:27] <vin> Quietwalker: Yes I was thinking of maintaining a global array of size equal to the number of producers and as each finish the work they update the array. Consumers will do a busy loop on the array and pick the task if state changes.
[07:47:50] <Quietwalker> Hmm.
[07:48:05] <Quietwalker> vin: Were I to write that, I'd add a third layer.
[07:48:14] <Quietwalker> Producers -> task manager -> consumers.
[07:48:30] <Quietwalker> the task manager can partition jobs out when consumers show as available
[07:48:31] *** Quits: snake (~snake@user/snake) (Quit: Namae nado nai, omae to onaji da..)
[07:49:18] <Quietwalker> but if it's a simple system, there's probably no need to abstract it that much.  Subjective where you draw the line.
[07:49:45] <Quietwalker> it depends how dependent you're willing to make the two classes on eachother.
[07:49:55] <Quietwalker> If it's never reasonably going to change, it won't matter much.
[07:50:09] <vin> One issue could be the array cache line ping ponging across multiple L2s of the cores and have to pad the array to avoid false sharing.
[07:50:54] <vin> what would be the advantage of task manager handing out jobs vs cosumers checking for jobs?
[07:50:59] *** Quits: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech) (Quit: Bye.)
[07:51:45] <Quietwalker> it reduces the dependency of consumers having to know how producers work, how many there are, other implementation details which may be subject to change
[07:52:29] <vin> I see. Yes this is just my workload generator -- so I wouldn't want to spend lot of time on it :)
[07:52:32] *** Joins: moose (~moose@user/moose)
[07:52:45] <Quietwalker> you also want to avoid polling wherever possible, so using an event based system to trigger explicit notifications is preferred
[07:53:23] <Quietwalker> and in any scenario where you have a pool of possible consumers, the standard pattern is to create a manager for it;  thread pools, processes, network connections, etc.
[07:53:25] *** Joins: gggp_ (~gggp@60.10.23.170)
[07:53:58] <Quietwalker> so the manager handles instantiating, allocation tasks to members, maintaining member state, dynamically allocating more members, etc.
[07:54:25] <Quietwalker> again, that's just a standard pattern, it won't necessarily be required for you.
[07:56:22] *** Quits: gggp (~gggp@60.10.23.170) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[07:56:26] <vin> I get your point though. I will consider this design for my main application.
[07:57:17] <Quietwalker> since you indicated that you don't have a 1:1 relationship between producers and consumers, some class will have to understand that and be able to route work intelligently between them, which means some sort of locking, nomination, or challenge
[07:57:31] *** Joins: b1101 (~b1101@ool-44c01641.dyn.optonline.net)
[07:57:35] <Quietwalker> and it's generally harder for the class in question to manage it's own locking for all members of the same class.
[07:57:46] *** Quits: elnavigator (~elnavigat@105.196.202.237) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[07:57:50] <vin> Quietwalker: if you write in C++, how do you manage your thread pools? I in general use thi https://github.com/progschj/ThreadPool/ but also use openMP when I find it easy.
[07:57:52] <Quietwalker> that logic is different enough that it'd be it's own class - a manager, in the end.
[07:59:02] <Quietwalker> I have not written C++ professionally for a while, I'm afraid.  When I did, I tended to roll my own.
[07:59:23] <Quietwalker> The state of the art has changed significantly since the last time I was called on to do so.
[07:59:40] <Quietwalker> I can say I'm more familiar with Java and C# these days.
[07:59:50] <vin> No worries, thanks!

[10:33:43] <PlanckWalk> With various face-stabbing levels of lag, yes.
[10:34:46] <PlanckWalk> If client-server lag applied to input and rendering as well, I'd definitely be looking for faces to stab.
[10:36:14] <Izem> when it's all sorted out on the client side it will run smoothly though :P
[10:36:31] <PlanckWalk> I'm in Australia, so lots of network games have > 300 milliseconds round trip lag.
[10:36:38] <Izem> oh :/
[10:37:03] <Izem> what about for much slower games like hearthstone
[10:37:17] <Izem> that simple game almost destroys my laptop lol
[10:37:20] <PlanckWalk> In theory there could be some Sydney datacentre rendering things for me with only 20 ms round trip, which might be barely tolerable.
[10:38:22] <PlanckWalk> Even in card games, I wouldn't want to have to wait 300 ms between me clicking on something and the display showing that I've clicked.

[15:15:06] <CoderGuy> what is a list of a list of?
[15:15:20] <CoderGuy> a list is just a list that's what it is, but I want said list to be singleton
[15:15:21] <bjs> CoderGuy: is it a list of road names? is it names of people? are they telephone numbers/
[15:15:31] <CoderGuy> unlimited possibilites, that's what makes the List class so great
[15:15:34] <GeDaMo> If it was a list of device names then DeviceNames

[15:16:19] <bjs> CoderGuy: why is the fact it's a singleton so important it has to be in the same?  singleton just means ther'es one of them

[15:22:49] *** Quits: tirnanog (~tirnanog@user/tirnanog) (Quit: = "")
[15:22:50] <bjs> CoderGuy: well making entire classes just to store a singleton is a very strange pattern that emerged with Java (and _this_ is the thing people often mean when they say it's an "anti-pattern") because well, variables exist for this purpose

[15:23:12] <bjs> CoderGuy: but more to the point, you have some very generic concept of what it is ("a singleton list") but ... singletons are a very concrete idea. You have _a_ thing that is the one and only thing
[15:23:29] <CoderGuy> yeah maybe that's okay then to just name it the variable name it would have
[15:23:32] <bjs> so a SingletonList class (or a singleton_list variable or whatever) is just *very odd*

[15:25:34] <CoderGuy> if the singleton was studentsnames i'd just call it students
[15:25:48] <CoderGuy> seems backwards but since there is one of them that might be logical
[15:25:53] <bjs> CoderGuy: yes, a `database` variable/class is much more descriptive
[15:26:09] <CoderGuy> normally i'd do like List database;
[15:26:17] <CoderGuy> but since it's a singleton it just is the database
[15:26:52] <CoderGuy> also this is not a database but a concept
[15:27:04] <CoderGuy> for my use case currently it's a list of stylsheets
[15:27:19] <GeDaMo> AllTheStylesheets
[15:27:28] <bjs> CoderGuy: but the point is that an actual singleton class is a very concrete thing, not an abstract idea.
[15:27:30] <CoderGuy> I see now what GeDaMo was getting at earlier
[15:27:50] <GeDaMo> What was that?
[15:28:07] <bjs> CoderGuy: (but also most languages just let you make a global variable without the faff of actually making a special singleton class)
[15:28:09] <CoderGuy> GeDaMo, just that, if it's a singleton you name it the variable name rather than a proper class name because it's going to be 1 of them
[15:28:22] <GeDaMo> Ah, OK
[15:28:35] <CoderGuy> bjs, yeah but if I make it global, then all the classes have to assume this global variable exists and if someone doesn't create said global variable the classes will fail
[15:28:47] <bjs> CoderGuy: note that you could just make a normal Database type (forgetting singletons entirely) then just make 1 instance of it as a global variable.

[15:32:35] <bjs> CoderGuy: sure but if you had a `class Database` then you'd be happy with a `Database database;` global var.  This global var *is* the singleton (by all definitions)
[15:32:36] <CoderGuy> I guess i'll call it StyleSheetList
[15:32:49] <CoderGuy> right exactly
[15:32:51] <CoderGuy> okay makes sense
[15:32:53] <bjs> so if you wanted to "lift" the Database class to a fancy singleton so you get rid of the global var
[15:33:10] <bjs> then it makes no sense to change the name of the class to suddenly be SingletonList rather than what it really is: Database
[15:33:14] <CoderGuy> I was just trying to grasp this idea, because in my mind it was a list but it's not it really is what it is
[15:33:25] <CoderGuy> yup
[15:33:28] <bjs> CoderGuy: I mean my `Database` might be a list, it might not be

[15:33:48] <CoderGuy> yup exactly
[15:34:07] <CoderGuy> sometimes it feels like I can use a primitive type to get around having a custom class name, but then others it's like "nah that's just the StyleSheetList"
[15:34:25] <bjs> CoderGuy: yes but you wouldn't say `List a_list;`  right?

[15:44:27] <CoderGuy> yeah I took list out, it's just StyleSheets :D
[15:44:47] <CoderGuy> it's clean, and the solution for the future is "just make the variable without it being global, the name you come up with, call the class that"
[15:45:06] <CoderGuy> so I was gonna do List stylesheets; that's how I found the name easily :D

[15:54:43] <smallville7123> would i need to interpolate frames?
[15:54:48] <CoderGuy> yeah because look
[15:54:56] <CoderGuy> so with 50 frames, 2 per frame you get to 100 right?
[15:55:08] <CoderGuy> and now 10 frames, 2 per frame you only get to 20
[15:55:23] <CoderGuy> so if you want the result to match, you have to have an equal amount per frame to reach result

[15:55:51] <CoderGuy> I didn't even look at your code just conceptiually I think you get it though

Because consumer systems *had* to evolve - in our culture - from the cheapest computers which could be fabricated, it follows that no consumer would ever learn about single-level store.

[17:49:29] <smallville7123> if the physics thread runs at a fixed speed with a fixed delta, drawing fps drops would result in frame skipping right?
[17:49:29] <smallville7123> eg if you draw every 1 second, and update physics every 1 second the result is smooth
[17:49:29] <smallville7123> but if the draw drops to 2 seconds, then 1 draw is missed every draw due to physics updating faster right, resulting in "jumps" right?

[17:54:49] <smallville7123> this cannot be avoided right?
[17:54:54] <PlanckWalk> But at least if the physics is still running at or near its usual rate, it wont' result in errors.
[17:55:25] <PlanckWalk> You can try to avoid having scenes that take 200 ms to draw :-p
[17:55:34] <mrig> alycidyne: I like to think more of flow than any limited space, it is only the accessing mechanism that needs to be flexed; All the data is still were it always was.
[17:55:49] <smallville7123> at least without making a potential physics heavy thread do its work in the UI thread instead right?
[17:55:59] <smallville7123> (which is bad)
[17:56:22] <smallville7123> (cus it will lag if the physics are very heavy, making the game unresponsive to input)
[17:56:26] <mrig> You just need to unveil it, it never goes anywhere nor do you acquire it, it always was.
[17:56:34] <PlanckWalk> Well, they don't really depend upon each other much so keep separate either way
[17:56:41] <mrig> right on-wards and sideways.
[17:56:55] <alycidyne> mrig: It also depends on what you want to do in life. I have always loved efficient - I repeat, *efficient* - machines and procedures... games were just a ridiculously poor way of expressing that for me
[17:57:05] <PlanckWalk> Putting them in separate threads is one way to do that.
[17:57:14] <smallville7123> yes
[17:57:25] <alycidyne> Now that I can direct computers to implement my ideas, I now want to see which ideas are most *efficient*.
[17:57:28] <PlanckWalk> But really both are likely to use more than one thread each
[17:57:41] <PlanckWalk> Or at least, should be capable of doing so
[17:57:54] <PlanckWalk> They're usually both highly parallelizable
[17:58:03] <alycidyne> (Well, most general as well as most efficient - but still, that's a big part)
[17:58:45] <smallville7123> if the UI handles the physics, then when the FPS drops to 10 then the physics will drop to 10 FPS as well to match the draw FPS at the cost of having an unresponsive game, right?

[18:13:39] <PlanckWalk> If you have a variable time step, the physics simulation can break down because it's "jumping" 5 times more each update.

[18:17:22] <smallville7123> or similar
[18:17:23] <PlanckWalk> Basically display frame rate matters least.  Physics update rate matters more, but not as much as consistent time steps.
[18:17:31] <smallville7123> or gettimeofday and so on

[19:29:55] <rudyard> pulse: thanks. that's all i needed to know. the problem with the first approach was that i didn't use `removeProperty` at first (i didn't know about it) and the inline styles set by `setProperty()` messed up my base styles.
[19:30:15] <rudyard> pulse: i'm still a beginner in JS.
[19:30:20] <pulse> it's generally a bad idea to change styles programatically

[19:31:27] <rudyard> pulse: somewhere i saw people using some checkbox input and doing this all in CSS without JS. but i feel JS would be needed now or later so i'm trying to learn it anyway without relying on CSS hacks or jquery or React.
[19:31:54] <pulse> you can achieve a lot with CSS, but if you can use JS you probably should
[19:31:59] <pulse> it's easier to reason about
[19:32:12] <pulse> high end CSS is particularly hard to reason about because of its reliance on side effects
[19:32:22] <pulse> so you end up with something beautiful but unmaintainable
[19:32:45] <pikapika> CSS is very hard
[19:32:48] <rudyard> i feel one should be able to do a lot of damage with vanilla JS alone. thanks.

[19:33:01] <pikapika> Its a fucking headache honestly

[23:14:53] <usr123> Hello All, What are the best books that you might know of that teach concepts by walking through a project? https://www.amazon.in/Writing-Compilers-Interpreters-Software-Engineering/dp/8126524049/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=ronald+mak&qid=1628016277&sr=8-1 Looking for something like this.

[23:16:40] <usr123> Would love to implement anything interesting, but it's even better if it's in the database/web/cloud sort of space. But again, most things I'd like to learn and implement I guess.
[23:17:11] <Izem> this compiler implementation looks really good https://drh.github.io/lcc/

[23:27:22] <usr123> Saved all/most of them.
[23:28:46] <usr123> Theory is interesting but I really like a book with implementations/walkthrough of software I use daily. I often wonder how does vlc/browser/programming language/text editor/syntax highlighting/code completion etc work.
[23:30:08] <usr123> linters too. Although I kind of understand it's almost same as compiling the code, (parsing to tokens, and static analysis on them). I really want to be able to implement my own some day.
[23:30:08] <pyzozord> usr123: for most those things you can actually just look up the source code, if not, you can for sure look up open source alternative
[23:30:50] <usr123> pyzozord: True, it's just that I'm not very good at reading the source code. A walkthrough or commentary or guided tour of the source really helps.
[23:31:36] <pyzozord> yeah it takes forever to get familiar with these for me too
[23:32:45] <pyzozord> Most of them feel like they are kind of a universe within a universe so to speak. I guess just expansive and complex
