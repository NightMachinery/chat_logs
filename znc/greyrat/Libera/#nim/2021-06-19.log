[01:31:37] <dom96> We're back on Libera.chat :)
[01:31:45] <FromDiscord> <treeform> cool
[01:32:16] <dom96> Our IRC logs are back now too and modernised: https://irclogs.nim-lang.org/
[01:33:15] <FromDiscord> <treeform> Cool I can see them
[01:33:48] <dom96> !eval echo("Test")

[01:33:58] <dom96> okay, all still working fine.

[01:34:29] <dom96> Now I can hopefully make some updates to NimBot tomorrow
[01:35:19] <FromDiscord> <dom96> @ElegantBeef were you expecting that to not work? 😛
[01:36:00] <FromDiscord> <dom96> I think the biggest things we need from NimBot are: multi-channel log support and maybe nicer display of discord messages
[01:36:11] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> In reply to @dom96 "<@!145405730571288577> were you expecting": Are you a cop?

[02:08:01] <FromDiscord> <dom96> ok
[02:10:54] <FromDiscord> <leorize> let's see how well this work
[02:11:28] <FromDiscord> <dom96> Now I'm wondering about our Telegram channel
[02:11:34] <FromDiscord> <dom96> is it time to bridge it too?

[02:12:16] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> Seems like the sensible thing is to ask them 😛
[02:12:27] <FromDiscord> <leorize> dom, can you turn off the gitter bridge?
[02:12:49] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> Or at the very least have a bridged telegram channel, so they speak here if they want to
[02:13:02] <FromGitter> <BracketMaster> I'm doing some posix drudgery in nim and can't figure out how to create an instance of Timeval()

[02:13:21] <FromGitter> <BracketMaster> ``Timeval(tv_sec : castdistinct clong (0), tv_usec : castclong (0))`` nim doesn't quite like that

[02:13:57] <FromDiscord> <leorize> yea
[02:14:03] <FromGitter> <dom96:matrix.org> I'm a little confused by the setup here
[02:14:10] <FromGitter> <dom96:matrix.org> shouldn't we see BracketMaster's message show up twice?
[02:14:14] <FromDiscord> <leorize> if we move the bridge there then gitter will go through matrix
[02:14:42] <FromGitter> <BracketMaster> "go through matrix" gives me 2000s vibes
[02:14:43] <FromDiscord> <leorize> and matrix go to discord which goes to irc
[02:14:50] <FromDiscord> <leorize> you can see the loop
[02:14:54] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> !eval import std/posix; let a = Timeval(tvsec: 0.Time, tvUsec: 0)
[02:14:57] <NimBot> <no output>

[02:18:53] <FromGitter> <dom96:matrix.org> oh because this channel isn't bridged to Discord right now
[02:18:53] <FromDiscord> <Ricky Spanish> anyone got experience with parse trees? im struggling to find a coherent way to generate back from a parse tree to source code since the parse tree contains nodes that contain tokens of all child nodes, so im not sure if the best way is to flag "parent" nodes to not output source tokens or if there are better ways to regenerate source from a parse-tree
[02:19:20] <FromGitter> <BracketMaster> I'm waiting for somebody to feed nim bot an infinite loop

[02:20:28] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> Do we still see bracket then?
[02:20:34] <FromDiscord> <dom96> Now I suppose I need to bridge #nim-lang:matrix.org to Discord
[02:20:50] <FromDiscord> <leorize> maybe the bridge will happen automatically on tombstone
[02:20:57] <FromDiscord> <dom96> okay
[02:20:59] <FromDiscord> <leorize> tombstone is kind of a "move here" event
[02:21:00] <FromDiscord> <dom96> let's try it
[02:21:05] <FromDiscord> <leorize> typically used for room upgrades
[02:21:11] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> So many bridges this is worse than a river crossing
[02:21:19] <FromDiscord> <leorize> but in this case we are downgrading \:P (this room is v6 and the other is v1)
[02:21:39] <FromDiscord> <dom96> does that make any difference? 🙂
[02:22:10] <FromDiscord> <leorize> some features need the newer version

[02:43:26] <FromDiscord> <deech> How do I convert a `string` to a `cstring`? `$` doesn't seem to work. Right now I'm allocating and naively copying character by character.
[02:43:48] <FromDiscord> <dom96> cstring is a `ptr char`
[02:43:55] <FromDiscord> <dom96> so you can either `addr str[0]`
[02:44:09] <FromDiscord> <dom96> (your `str` might be deallocated by gc)
[02:44:21] <FromDiscord> <dom96> or you `alloc` memory and copy the string there
[02:44:25] <FromDiscord> <planetis> Just use cstring(x)
[02:44:26] <FromDiscord> <leorize> what kind of conversion are you looking for?
[02:45:32] <FromDiscord> <deech> Just copy the contents of a string to a cstring.
[02:45:38] <FromDiscord> <deech> Not convert, sorry.
[02:45:55] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> Hm. What is the difference between a 'var' return type, and a 'lent' return type?
[02:46:22] <FromDiscord> <Hi02Hi> var is mutable, lent isnt
[02:46:48] <FromDiscord> <Hi02Hi> surely you know that
[02:47:16] <FromDiscord> <leorize> @deech\: like you got an external buffer and you want to copy the data over?
[02:47:24] <FromDiscord> <deech> Yep
[02:47:27] <FromDiscord> <leorize> then yea, loop and copy works, or you can use copyMem
[02:47:57] <FromDiscord> <dom96> @Hi02Hi `lent` is a pretty new addition to the language
[02:48:22] <FromDiscord> <dom96> and I think it has a deeper meaning than "immutable"
[02:48:32] <FromDiscord> <dom96> (but I also have no idea what it means)
[02:49:04] <FromDiscord> <deech> You can just copyMem a `string` into a `cstring` ? I thought they had different representations.
[02:49:31] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> @Hi02Hi Not `var x = y` vs `let x = y`, but `proc foo(): var T` vs `proc foo(): lent T`
[02:52:18] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> In reply to @deech "You can just copyMem": I don't think you can
[02:52:44] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> they do have different representations
[02:52:57] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> but there is a zero-cost copy
[02:53:07] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> if you just do string.cstring
[02:53:12] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> or whatever
[02:53:23] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> or zero-copy conversion I should say
[02:54:22] <FromDiscord> <dom96> pretty sure that is equivalent to `addr str[0]`
[02:54:41] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> @deech @Zachary Carter You would `moveMem(addr nimString[0], addr cstr[0], sizeof(char)len(cstr)`. But an easier way to go about that would probably be to just use a `for` loop.
[02:55:04] <FromDiscord> <dom96> string is basically: tuple[len: int, data: cstring]
[02:55:08] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> copyMem / moveMem loks easier than a for loop to me
[02:55:15] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> (edit) "loks" => "looks"
[02:55:35] <FromDiscord> <leorize> @deech\: `copyMem(cstring(str), addr target, length)`
[02:55:37] <FromDiscord> <leorize> copyMem is unsafe though
[02:55:44] <FromDiscord> <deech> Don't we need to also add a null byte at the end?
[02:55:55] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> I think it's already done for you
[02:56:00] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> Lets check.
[02:56:09] <FromDiscord> <leorize> just `+1` to the length \:P
[02:56:10] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> who needs safety really
[02:57:33] <FromDiscord> <shadow.> what's the best way to use a nim lsp on neovim? i saw the nim.nvim plugin but i'm worried that'll conflict with youcompleteme so i was wondering if there's a way to do it through youcompleteme directly
[02:58:07] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> @deech @Zachary Carter Nope. https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3qoa
[02:58:27] <FromDiscord> <dom96> one of these days I will write a program that analyses code for unsafe calls and gives the source code a score

[03:00:47] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> Hm, based on https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/manual_experimental.html#view-types and https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#procedures-var-return-type
[03:01:16] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> it doesn't seem like `lent` is all that different from `var`, at least from a conceptual point of view.
[03:01:18] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> In reply to @dom96 "one of these days": pretty sure tools like this already exist
[03:01:21] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> for C anyway
[03:01:23] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> and C++
[03:01:30] <FromDiscord> <dom96> @Zachary Carter I'm sure they do
[03:01:39] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> Intel has a pretty good one.
[03:01:44] <FromDiscord> <dom96> I was inspired by the Rust tool that does the same
[03:01:54] <FromDiscord> <dom96> Rust does make this kind of analysis trivial
[03:02:43] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> I think such tools are somewhat pedantic in a lot of circumstances
[03:02:50] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> in others they make a lot of sense
[03:03:20] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> sorry - my game is going to be full of unsafe code, because I need to do unsafe things
[03:03:51] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> such a tool for me is totally useless
[03:04:06] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> but if I was writing space shuttle software
[03:04:09] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> I certainly would care much more
[03:04:26] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> In reply to @Varriount "it doesn't seem like": I once heard that `lent` isn't guaranteed to always use a hidden pointer in the future
[03:04:47] <FromDiscord> <dom96> It's kind of like static typing, some don't care
[03:04:51] <FromDiscord> <dom96> which is fine
[03:05:01] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> oh static typing is always useful though
[03:05:03] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> it's never not a good thing
[03:05:05] <FromDiscord> <dom96> you don't need to write space shuttle software to care about using libraries that minimise unsafe code
[03:05:17] <FromDiscord> <dom96> how is unsafe code different?
[03:05:18] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> again it depends on the situation
[03:05:26] <FromDiscord> <dom96> it's always best to avoid it
[03:05:27] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> if you're writing game code, you probably don't care if the libraries you depend on are safe or not
[03:05:32] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> I disagree
[03:06:00] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> you potentially sacrifice performance and time for what gain if your program is simply running a simulation?
[03:06:36] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> it's not like games are critical pieces of software that will cost  human lives or lots of money if they fail
[03:06:42] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> they'll get a neckbeard angry
[03:07:24] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> I think's Rust's focus on safety and its community's zealous pursuit of it is a bad thing
[03:07:49] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> library maintainers are shamed into making sure their libraries meet some asinine safety standards
[03:09:19] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> Araq: How are `lent` and `var` types conceptually different? From what I can tell, a `lent` type is the same as a `var` type, but with additional capabilities.
[03:09:40] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> I think you can ping him on discord
[03:09:44] <FromDiscord> <dom96> okay, let me soften what I said a bit: it's always best to at least think about an abstraction that is safe and performant
[03:09:46] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> unless he's disabled them
[03:10:10] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> @Araq / Araq: How are lent and var types conceptually different? From what I can tell, a lent type is the same as a var type, but with additional capabilities.
[03:10:46] <FromDiscord> <dom96> If you have a hot code path that you want to optimise with unsafe code then go for it, but don't just write unsafe code because you can everywhere, most code paths aren't hot 🙂
[03:11:00] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> fwiw, Araq recently did some spec changes for view types: https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/18226
[03:11:23] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> I think pretty much anything that doesn't rely on the stdlib / GC is going to be full of unsafe code
[03:11:43] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> And if they are different, but not too different, then I feel like it might be better to go with just `lent` (or `var`) because I can see this tripping up users multiple times.
[03:12:01] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> for instance, my library has a bunch of different allocation functions that ultimately use `alloc` or `allocShared` depending on whether thread support is enabled or not
[03:12:14] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> this allows me to track unsafe allocations and detect leaks and also trace memory allocations by subsystem in my project
[03:12:43] <FromDiscord> <Hi02Hi> oh sorry Varriount for assuming you knew more than me on that
[03:13:03] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> since I am using threads in several of my subsystems, my allocations will almost always be on the shared heap so I need to pass pointers around everywhere internally, and pointer arithmetic is handy often
[03:13:30] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> doing this safely would require channels and other abstractions that just aren't worth the performance hit at the end of the day
[03:14:02] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> especially since I'm calling into assembly code for creating / switching between fibers
[03:14:17] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> there's just no good safe way to do this stuff
[03:14:49] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> or at least I don't know of one - if there is one, I'm sure it would take me a long time to adopt / learn / implement
[03:15:52] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> Hm. Is there any technical reason why creating a `distinct FileHandle` type and implementing `=sink`, `=destroy`, and `=copy` procedures on it, would be a bad idea?
[03:16:09] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> I could have sworn I came up with a reason last night, but can't remember what it was.
[03:16:45] <FromDiscord> <dom96> @Zachary Carteryour library provides abstractions which are hopefully safe, of course you need to do unsafe things at the "edges"
[03:16:58] <FromDiscord> <Hi02Hi> isnt a FileHandle a string? why should have a different `=destroy`?
[03:17:02] <FromDiscord> <dom96> the Nim GC does unsafe stuff too, but hopefully it's tested well enough and provides abstractions that are safe
[03:17:27] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> well yeah a lot of stdlib does
[03:17:33] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> In reply to @Hi02Hi "isnt a FileHandle a": It's a cint on Linux.
[03:17:49] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> FileHandle is a file descriptor
[03:18:10] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> ultimately I just expose a C API to my users so they can come up with whatever abstraction they want on top of it 🙂
[03:18:59] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> and can write their code in whatever language they want
[03:19:04] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> as long as it can interop with C
[03:19:46] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> I'm sure my project would fail any kind of static safety analysis though

[06:56:36] *** Joins: vicfred (~vicfred@user/vicfred)

[07:00:03] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> correct me if I'm wrong but if I made a package that uses this library as is as a "binary" nimble package, `nimble install` wouldn't actually work right? Since it would always be missing the shared libraries?
[07:00:35] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> Nimterop fetches the binaries required, so it should afaik

[07:16:32] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> I still just want channelled voip then matrix is perfect

[07:17:52] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> In reply to @Rika "isnt there a foreignrequires": so this almost works for me, except that libbass isn't packaged for most distros, and nimbass always sets the dynamic library loading path to be the same directory as the binary itself
[07:17:55] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> As such conference call voip suck
[07:17:55] <FromDiscord> <Rika> ok social boy
[07:18:32] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @ajusa "so this almost works": sounds like its time for static libraries
[07:18:46] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> In reply to @ajusa "so this almost works": I believe the compiler has something to override that. A more permanent solution would be to fix nimbass. Why is it loading from a path at all though?
[07:19:06] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> In reply to @Varriount "I believe the compiler": what do you mean? aren't all dynamic libraries loaded from a path?
[07:21:09] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> In reply to @ajusa "what do you mean?": Yes, but usually, rather than something like `loadLibrary("path/to/library.so")` it's `loadLibrary("library.so")`, which, afaik, loads from PATH on Windows and... LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux.
[07:21:39] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> (edit) "from" => "looks in the paths contained in the" | "looks in the paths contained in thePATH ... on" 03added "environment variable"
[07:21:56] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> I dont know if that changes anything in this example though does it, since the binary is built and stored in the nimble directory
[07:22:27] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> https://github.com/genotrance/nimbass/blob/master/nimbass/bass.nim#L59 sets the rpath to be the same directory as the binary. I could fork and change that though...
[07:23:45] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> In reply to @ajusa "https://github.com/genotrance/nimbass/blob/master/n": Just curious, is libbass in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable (or rather, the directory it's in)?
[07:24:22] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> it shouldn't be since I've never actually installed it
[07:24:50] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> nimterop downloads the shared library itself
[07:36:14] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> also after reading through nimterop's documentation it should be statically linking since nimbass doesn't use the dynlib flag
[07:36:53] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> So seems you just need to get the build to point at the right path?
[07:38:47] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> maybe?
[07:40:00] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> idk it's late here I'll need to take another look tomorrow but I think that either statically building it or making sure that the shared libraries are copied over is the right way to proceed
[07:43:54] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> Hrm. Why does Nimble require my home directory to be in my PATH variable?

[08:14:21] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> In reply to @Rika "why do you need": it's a pretty common pattern in C - you have a header file defining an interface and an implementation file and then as long as the symbols in the implementation are linked, the compiler doesn't care if the implementation isn't present in the file the forward decl is in
[08:14:32] <FromDiscord> <Rika> probably because sometimes spaces arent desired as the separator in your application?
[08:14:40] <FromDiscord> <Zachary Carter> so I can avoid a tight coupling between modules

[08:18:05] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> You could do something silly with a macro but yea no proper forward declare, symbol wouldnt be bound until "implemented" in module b

[09:27:15] <FromDiscord> <leorize> coercing based on possible overloads is not impossible (it already exists in a way), just not implemented
[09:27:28] <FromDiscord> <Rika> it may make sense at a glance that "of course it would be a u8 theres no other way it couldnt be" but what if there were more toString procs?
[09:27:30] <FromDiscord> <Rika> what then?
[09:28:11] <FromDiscord> <Rika> its probably going to be somewhat confusing if it was allowed, coercing based on function signature
[09:28:17] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> Yea it being in the MCS means that you dont have the right hand information yet since Nim is a left to right inference language atm afaik
[09:28:39] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> Though i guess it gets rewritten so that might not be an issue
[09:28:44] <FromDiscord> <leorize> you are reading too much into the implementation
[09:29:26] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> Hey i implemented silly type inference for enums so i'm like a type god! 😛
[09:29:38] <FromDiscord> <leorize> lol
[09:29:49] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> I am not a type god, i'm barely a type mortal
[09:30:11] <FromDiscord> <leorize> I think I heard somewhere that haskell have this kind of inference
[09:30:24] <FromDiscord> <Rika> yes it does i believe
[09:30:29] <FromDiscord> <Rika> so does rust too i believe
[09:30:42] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> Yea rust does have reverse inference
[09:30:42] <FromDiscord> <Rika> i guess its not actually that confusing now that i thought more about it
[09:30:47] <FromDiscord> <leorize> ever the less arguments for why nim shouldn't have it \:P
[09:31:01] <FromDiscord> <Rika> so when are we getting it
[09:31:02] <FromDiscord> <Rika> smh
[09:31:28] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> Leorize just volunteered to add it, you seen it right rika? 😛
[09:32:02] <FromDiscord> <Rika> nim boutta have a hybrid HM and (whatever the current type system is) type system?
[09:32:07] <FromDiscord> <leorize> it's gonna be awhile before I touch the compiler again, so keep waiting \:P
[09:32:23] <FromDiscord> <Rika> ill just run at light speed, then itll be finished in no time
[09:33:18] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> I kind want to try that enum stuff "properly" but ugh actually adding stuff, that's how I spend forever trying to understand the compiler
[09:33:18] <FromDiscord> <leorize> it's a lost cause
[09:33:24] <FromDiscord> <leorize> don't even try unless you really have to
[09:34:16] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> Well i'd like the smarter enums to be in, so only partial "have to"
[09:34:17] <FromDiscord> <leorize> smarter enums?
[09:34:30] <FromDiscord> <Rika> yeah he wants his enums to cook for him
[09:35:00] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> Enums based off context so `let a: Align = left` works even if there are multiple `left`s
[09:35:19] <FromDiscord> <leorize> doesn't that already exist with `{.pure.}`?
[09:35:34] <FromDiscord> <leorize> at least it seems to be for cps
[09:35:34] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> No you have to do `Align.left`
[09:36:29] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> If you have multiple enums with the same name you have to specify where the symbol comes from, the idea is that since the type information is there there isnt any point
[09:36:29] <FromDiscord> <leorize> so currently it's kinda like how module resolution work
[09:36:39] <FromDiscord> <leorize> you gotta spell it out, correct?
[09:37:30] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> Yea
[09:37:30] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> My RFC/PR made it so the enums could be inferred from the value in the case it was unambigious
[09:37:31] <FromDiscord> <leorize> sounds good to me
[09:38:48] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/373 if you want to read about it
[09:38:49] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> But it's mostly just me drowning on
[09:38:49] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> Droning, draining, or some other word that makes sense
[09:38:49] <FromDiscord> <leorize> most language features don't make it to nim unless you write it yourself or the implementation is simple enough
[09:39:20] <FromDiscord> <Rika> droning
[09:39:50] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> I know rika i wasnt sincerely asking, i was mocking myself, cmon get with the system
[09:40:05] <FromDiscord> <Rika> you know?
[09:40:14] <FromDiscord> <Rika> surprising
[09:40:26] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> Indeed
[10:12:00] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> In reply to @leorize "most language features don't": And an unfortunate prerequisite of that is understanding the compiler...
[10:18:07] <FromDiscord> <codic> In reply to @Rika "it may make sense": i think you should specify the type if there's more than one overload but otherwise it should auto coerce; plus, something like this↵`proc toString(x: openArray[uint8])`↵`proc toString(x: openArray[uint16])` if you pass it `6_900` it should call the second overload without needing a u16 prefix because it can't fit in a uint8
[10:19:12] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> Except the issue isnt on the calling end presently, it's on the parsing end
[10:20:16] <FromDiscord> <Elegant Beef> when you do `[10, 20, 30]` it's an `array[0..3, int]` so `toString([10, 20, 30])` isnt valid
[10:20:17] <FromDiscord> <rainbowasteroids> what gui library do y'all prefer?

[18:04:22] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> In reply to @dom96 "no one answered lol": Most of the activity in the tg chat happens when someone asks a question, otherwise nothing really happens. It can be several days where just new forum thread auto-updater posts things, sometimes spliced with another spambot
[18:06:30] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> And there are even fewer people who can definitely answer this "I want it" or "I don't want it" (from those who are not already on both platofrms like me/yardanico/juancarlospaco and to lesser extent mratsim)
[18:09:26] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> And I've seen a lot of times replies like "idk probably, it is better to ask on IRC/discord because <reason>"
[18:13:24] <FromDiscord> <leorize> then I suppose we should bridge?
[18:16:34] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Well, yes. I mean if people are dissatisfied with this we can revert it, right?
[18:17:01] <FromDiscord> <Rika> i dont see why people would be dissatisfied with it though
[18:17:41] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Maybe at the start when we merge two not very small chats together it might cause some confusion, but otherwise it should fine

[18:18:48] <FromDiscord> <Rika> that was fuckin quick
[18:19:04] <FromDiscord> <leorize> we need a telegram mod
[18:19:09] <FromDiscord> <leorize> are you one @haxscramper ?
[18:19:40] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> no, I'm not a mod. @dom96  is a tg chat owner, @Yardanico is an admin
[18:20:06] <FromDiscord> <leorize> then we need either one of them to show up

[19:35:09] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> In reply to @dom96 "<@!608382355454951435> the thing about": Yeah, they also do post questions that are hanging unanswered unless someone (most of the time from people I already mentioned) and answers them. And there is not that much memes, except for this guy with cat gifs, but I I'd you ask me I would restrict him sending media anyway if I had a say in this

[19:36:40] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> So I'm short yes, I partially agree with you but it does not seem like a reason why we should keep them restricted  from all other bridges
[19:36:59] <FromDiscord> <dom96> fair enough, if we can moderate it then questions being unanswered is reason enough to bridge IMO

[23:21:29] <FromDiscord> <Bung> how can i get module full path through the module name symbol
[23:22:55] *** Quits: SebastianM (~seba@user/sebastianm) (Quit: Bye)
[23:28:23] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `hnimast/compiler_aux/getFilePath(ModuleGraph, PSym)
[23:28:25] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> (edit) "PSym)" => "PSym)`"
[23:29:00] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `PSym` has `.info` field that contains index of the file that you need to look up in graph config file infos
[23:31:01] <FromDiscord> <gavr> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3qtC
[23:31:25] <FromDiscord> <Bung> the problem is where is module graph comming from ?
[23:32:40] <FromDiscord> <gavr> instead of nil there may be callback when its done, same for copy and move, but its callbacks get 2 params, bytes done and bytes remained, so its easy to create loading bar
[23:33:21] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> @Bung  if you are working with file module symbols you need to have module graph
[23:33:46] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> So you create module graph, register custom pass and then `compileProject`
[23:33:49] <FromDiscord> <Bung> I want parse a module while I get module name
[23:34:14] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Then keep track of paths yourself
[23:34:27] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> parser does not have enough information to resolve module from name alone
[23:35:21] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> In reply to @Bung "how can i get": Are you talking `PSym` for module name or just string identifier like `"os"`
[23:35:30] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Those are two completely different thigns
[23:35:33] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> (edit) "thigns" => "things"
[23:35:49] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Well, not entirely different but you need to know which is which
[23:35:55] <FromDiscord> <Bung> I'd like to do import moduleA ; dosth(moduleA)
[23:36:50] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> You want to do it where/how? Last time you were trying to get all exported procs for a module
[23:37:04] <FromDiscord> <Bung> dont know how to get module graph when I just get moduleA, the graph need module path right ?
[23:37:24] <FromDiscord> <Bung> conf.projectFull = file↵  var graph = newModuleGraph(cache, conf)
[23:38:29] <FromDiscord> <Bung> If I need track path then that need parse the current nim file imports
[23:39:36] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3qtF
[23:40:36] <FromDiscord> <idf> i think you can group matrix rooms in like communities. So Nim and Nim science would be in the same community
[23:40:44] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3qtG
[23:41:00] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Isn't it done already?
[23:41:07] <FromDiscord> <dom96> yep, it is
[23:41:13] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> There is a nim room/space
[23:41:13] <FromDiscord> <dom96> https://matrix.to/#/#nim:envs.net
[23:42:23] <FromDiscord> <Bung> well, I dont like manual get the module path
[23:43:09] <FromDiscord> <Bung> I attempt to provide api to end user , let user do import moduleA; dosth(moduleA); that's all
[23:43:52] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> And? like I don't quite understand where do you plan to write this code to begin with This is some custom DSL or a configuration file
[23:43:55] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Or what
[23:45:22] <FromDiscord> <Bung> it's like var router = new Router();router.mount(theModule);newWebApp(router);
[23:45:41] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> You would have to write a custom compiled frontend for this
[23:45:47] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> compiler
[23:45:59] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> And make users compile your code with this compiler
[23:46:46] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Otherwise it could be done via https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/9560
[23:49:13] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> But Idk if it would be merged at some point or not
[23:51:16] <FromDiscord> <Bung> that's sad
[23:52:28] <FromDiscord> <leorize> you can build a macro to create a map for you
[23:52:57] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> yeah, common approach is to build a custom pragma
[23:53:21] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> And then ask user to `{.push.` it (I think you can push custom pragmas, but I'm not sure)
[23:54:00] <FromDiscord> <leorize> or you can just put the module body under the macro
[23:54:09] <FromDiscord> <leorize> lol you're typing on both matrix and discord?
[23:54:21] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> In reply to @gavr "If anybody need this\:": btw telegram -> discord messages are related with `<br>` lines, but discord -> telegram is working fine
[23:54:32] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> multiline code pastes
[23:54:40] <FromDiscord> <leorize> weird
[23:54:54] <FromDiscord> <Bung> hmm , push pop seems friendly
[23:56:16] <FromDiscord> <Bung> but in that case , it does not have router information
[23:57:05] <FromDiscord> <@bracketmaster-5a708063d73408ce4> Like I mentioned before, I'm writing a POWERPC emulator in Nim. My emulator can load multiple binaries, and to stop the emulator, sometimes you have to press ctrl-c if for whatever reason, the emulated CPU becomes unresponsive. I need to make sure that any opened files are correctly closed. I can put try/except around main, but then I have to also put f.close in the except block which means I have to keep track of
[23:57:11] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3qtK
[23:57:34] <FromDiscord> <@bracketmaster-5a708063d73408ce4> Is there a better solution than this? For example, python has a destructor that always gets called even during exceptions
[23:58:13] <FromDiscord> <leorize> [BracketMaster (Yehowshua Immanuel)](https://matrix.to/#/@bracketmaster-5a708063d73408ce4f8ad7ee:gitter.im)\: try-finally
[23:58:22] <FromDiscord> <leorize> or `defer`
[23:58:30] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Does it handle ctrl-C though?
