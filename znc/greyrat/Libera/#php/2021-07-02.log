[01:15:21] <Blondie101010> loophp:  how is that relevant to your problem?  are you trying to delete obsolete files?
[01:15:52] <loophp> No no no don't mind the commit :) Check the tests. It behaves differently on Mac.
[01:16:04] <loophp> @TinoDidriksen weird but thanks
[01:16:28] <Blondie101010> what test behaves different?  so far TinoDidriksen got the same results
[01:17:00] <Blondie101010> I would not be surprised if there was a difference in your regex implementation
[01:17:11] <Blondie101010> but so far it's not even clearly shown
[01:17:22] <loophp> yes indeed, but using Github CI, the test behaves differently on Mac OS for some reason since a couple of releases.
[01:17:43] <loophp> "        expected [integer:1], but got [integer:0]."
[01:18:11] <Blondie101010> from `echo preg_match('/\\\\([^\\\\]+)\s*$/', ' Bunny\Channel', $matches) . "\n";`?

[01:20:46] <loophp> Oki
[01:20:47] <Blondie101010> I can't see how it would not find a match in there
[01:21:04] <loophp> yeah this is weird.

[01:30:03] <loophp> In order to open an issue on phpspec/phpspec project, I made a project where those `preg_match` lines are in.
[01:30:19] <loophp> Then, with Github CI, I run those tests on Linux, Windows and MacOS.
[01:30:38] <loophp> Linux and Windows returns `1` for both calls, but not MacOS.
[01:32:14] <loophp> The test project is here: https://github.com/drupol/test-phpspec-darwin
[01:35:22] <Blondie101010> do you mean that `var_dump(preg_match('/\\\\([^\\\\]+)\s*$/', ' App\Factories\RabbitMQFactory', $matches));` gives you int(0)?

[12:38:39] <Koopz> so i'm trying to figure out a session handling issue with a website i have no access to and need some information on session handling when using multiple webservers for loadbalancing. I don't really have any knowledge about load balancing so i'm wondering how that even works, like does the load balancer forward the request to a random server which
[12:38:39] <Koopz> returns a set-cookie header and from that point on routes subsequent queries to the same server?
[12:40:26] <Koopz> there's probably a gajillion ways to handle sessions, like storing them in a database and let all webservers have access to that one to not be reliant on the requests getting to the same server
[12:43:43] <Koopz> but i've been monitoring this laravel based application with multiple browsers, firing requests on a regular basis and checking the session id and saw those sessions expire at seemingly random times. There's no pattern whatsoever. You can have a session that's going strong for 7 hours and i've also seen one getting killed off within a single minute
[12:45:40] <Koopz> without any knowledge about the infrastructure behind that website it's probably hard to make anything else than hot takes but from the sheer userbase i at least assume there isn't just a single webserver behind that cloudflare wall
[12:48:28] <Koopz> so if this is a setup with multiple webservers but without shared session management between them i can think of two reasons for sessions dying: The loadbalancer routing the requests randomly fucks up and sometimes sends requests meant for other webservers to another one, resulting in a new session being started
[12:49:42] <Koopz> or another possibility: container running the webserver got killed off for some reason, forcing the loadbalancer to route it to another one, not being able to keep the session up

[13:55:48] *** Joins: Woet (~me@irc.woet.me)
[14:02:49] <Naktibalda> I don't think that this is apache question
[14:04:03] <Naktibalda> Koopz: do you get some error when session id stops working?
[14:05:00] <Koopz> what do you mean by "error"?
[14:05:21] <Naktibalda> WSOD kind of thing
[14:05:28] <Naktibalda> how do you know that it failed?
[14:05:44] <Naktibalda> W for Windows, not White
[14:06:21] <Koopz> i know the session dies because the server responds to my request with a set-cookie header that has a different ID than the last request
[14:06:49] <Naktibalda> that's not "dies", it could be "regenerated", which is a security feature.
[14:07:30] <Koopz> additionally to the session id there's also a csrf token that get's spitted out into the HTML as javascript variable
[14:08:19] <Koopz> as long as the session id stays the same, that csrf token does as well
[14:08:57] <Koopz> when the session id changes and you try to fire a request along with the old csrf token, you receive a 403
[14:09:04] <Naktibalda> do you have to login to this site?
[14:09:10] <Koopz> yep
[14:09:20] <Naktibalda> do you get logged out when session id changes?
[14:09:24] <Koopz> no
[14:09:29] <Naktibalda> then session doesn't die
[14:09:51] <Naktibalda> no problem there, it is working
[14:10:00] <Koopz> working as intended you say
[14:10:04] <Naktibalda> yep
[14:10:31] <Naktibalda> I would expect users to be randomly logged out if there was issue with session storage.
[14:13:05] <Koopz> is it okay for csrf token to be invalid as soon as a session is "regenerated"?
[14:13:19] <Koopz> and why does a session "regenerate" at irregular intervals?
[14:16:56] <Koopz> the actual problem that i have with this website is that it's some SPA with a JS script that let's the browser refresh the page automatically as soon as one of the requests it fires by itself runs into a 403 caused by an expired csrf token.
[14:18:18] <Koopz> there's also an exception that instead just displays an error message notifying the user that they have to refresh the page in case the requests that was fired was one that'd write something to the database
[14:19:41] <Koopz> the problem with that exception case is that this SPA likes to fire non-writing requests in the background while you're editing your form (preparing for the actual write-request) and poof go all your changes
[14:21:01] <Koopz> the devs themselves say "it's a bug" but they're too stubborn to implement a workaround and would rather get it properly fixed but they haven't moved their asses for years and do other changes noone cares about
[14:22:36] <Koopz> so i as a user that get's majorly pissed off by those refreshes actively disturbing my workflow started investigating the issue and trying to come up with a solution via a userscript
[14:26:31] <ss23> a csrf token doesn't need to be refreshed almost ever, just on login is enough
[14:26:36] <ss23> (I didn't read up in the page)
[14:26:55] <Koopz> tell that to the devs
[14:27:39] <Koopz> i can update the csrf token through the userscript and prevent the 403 from happening in the first place
[14:28:39] <Koopz> however i don't know *when* i am supposed to check wether the update is needed and execute it
[14:28:55] <Koopz> can't exactly run that check every second
[14:29:39] <Koopz> but i also kinda doubt that i'll be able to hijack this React mess and execute the check before their JS makes a request

[20:54:15] <olle> Good to get rid of magic strings, but...
[20:54:39] <__adrian> > If a classical array callable like [$this, 'privateMethod'] is used, then visibility will be checked at the point where the call is performed
[20:54:40] <olle> array_map(strlen(...), $arr);
[20:54:41] <olle> Hm
[20:54:45] <__adrian> this would seem counterproductive
[20:55:02] <olle> I'm also unsure about that, sounds like leaking
[20:55:26] <__adrian> it's making a new syntax for an existing problem behavior
[20:56:01] <olle> wym?
[20:56:44] <stenno> imagine having first class function objects in php
[20:56:53] <stenno> oh it was mentioned
[20:57:15] <__adrian> the whole point of Closure::fromCallable (which this rfc is effectively just sugar for) is to nail down calling scope and prevent unexpected behavior when you use a callable in one scope vs. another
[20:57:35] <olle> Well, tell them on the mailing list :)
[20:57:47] <olle> I might be because of implementation issues
[20:57:51] <olle> details*
[20:58:07] <__adrian> nah. it works fine with Closure::fromCallable
[20:59:04] <olle> array_map((fn) strlen, $arr); or array_map((callable) strlen, $arr);
[20:59:40] <__adrian> (callable) doesn't make sense. it's already callable.
[20:59:51] <olle> No, it's a constant xD
[20:59:58] <__adrian> well, as a string, it's callable
[21:00:00] <olle> It's only a callable when it's called...
[21:00:11] <olle> array_map("strlen", $arr) works, yes
[21:00:26] <__adrian> so all (callable) would do is quash the undefined constant error.
[21:00:47] <olle> No, it would tell the compiler to look in the function bucket instead of the constant bucket.
[21:01:16] <olle> More chars than current RFC, tho
[21:01:22] <olle> Guess it's good enough :)
[21:02:05] <olle> Problem is the ugly boilerplace when you pipe multiple functions, but there's no solution for that. *Unless* the pipe operator has a different parsing rule, which won't happen.
[21:03:23] <stenno> wait is pipeline operator a thing in php?
[21:03:35] <__adrian> no
[21:03:38] <__adrian> it's another rfc
[21:03:46] <stenno> ok
[21:03:54] <stenno> shame
[21:04:14] <stenno> yah i see it wouldn't make a sense in the first place right now
[21:04:25] <__adrian> > The $$ based variant allows using more than plain function calls in each pipeline step (e.g. you could have $$->getName() as a step, something not possible with PFA), and is also trivially free.
[21:04:30] <__adrian> well there's something cool i hadn't thought of
[21:04:43] <olle> You can rather easily define your own pipe() for some cases.
[21:04:51] <olle> It's in psl lib or what it's called
[21:05:12] <olle> __adrian: That's the Hack lang version
[21:05:24] <olle> They also allow expressions like |> $$ + 10
[21:06:21] <__adrian> is (e.g.)  n() |> $$ + 10  just n() + 10  ?
[21:06:37] <olle> In this case, yes :)
[21:06:39] <olle> I think
[21:07:03] <olle> It's only useful when un-nesting multiple function calls, I guess
[21:07:13] <__adrian> in any case, yes, the fact that $$ can be used as an operand vs. just a placeholder is significant
[21:08:05] <olle> idk, I feel it's getting too ambitious. even the pfa rfc as it was.
[21:08:42] <__adrian> imo,  |> $$  was good. bummer we didn't have it five years ago.
[21:09:34] <__adrian> (...) seems like useful-but-likely-to-go-unused
[21:10:34] <olle> It's only there to do the pfa step by step ;)
[21:10:56] <__adrian> tbc, not "useful" wrt  strlen(...)  vs. "strlen"
[21:11:09] <__adrian> just type the quotes  :p
[21:11:19] <olle> magic strings is not a good habit, with regard to intent
[21:11:21] <__adrian> but as a shorthand for closure:;fromcallable
[21:11:31] <__adrian> s/;/:/
