But my website can't be reached any more on port 443. Should forward port 443 on my server or contact the provider to let the port open?

[01:04:44] <Jeremy31> LoUDcLoUD: there was a workaround a few years ago for the opposite issue.  You had to install blueman, then right click device, go to sound profile, choose off, then disconnect the headset, reconnect then you could use the other sound profile

[03:42:58] <sybariten> so, i read about two ways to check if i'm running a classical BIOS or UEFI system. I am currently booting from USB though. first i mounted the inernal HD and looked for sys/firmware/efi. My whole (mounted) sys was empty.

[03:59:41] <EriC^> sybariten: what's the actual problem you're having
[04:00:26] <EriC^> sybariten: a better way to see what the install is, is to do 'grep efi /mountpoint/etc/fstab' and see if there's an efi partition being mounted
[04:00:48] <EriC^> what's the issue you're having though, why do you want to know if it's efi/legacy?
[04:01:00] <sybariten> EriC^: well it's a boot failure, immediately when turning on the machine. Used to be a working ubuntu system but i think i shut it off a bit violently or something. There was some discussions indicating that its good to know if its legacy bios or UEFI ...  but i should probably just follow the grub reinstall instructions that ravager posted above

[08:10:42] <stats4647> Hi, I have a Linux VM on the Google cloud (only terminal access, no Google administration atm) and I am trying to understand / benchmark the disk. I ran fio but am a bit confused by the output. What should I compare it to? I am running a database doing lots of reads/writes. I know this is a bit nebulous, but would appreciate some guidance on what modern database servers need. Part of the exercise is to figure out whether th

[14:28:38] <willcl_ark> lotuspsychje: I really think you are mistaken here. The programs look totally different? Your package also does not install `renameat` and `renameat2` which my linked one purports to. One is c, one is perl.  Your perl one seems to be focussed on changing file names rather than atomically renaming via unlink and new symlink to new inode...

[16:31:12] <EriC^^> sybariten: i'd try honestly to reset bios first, it might just need some reset, after you chroot basically you create a 1-2MB partition (you have like 500mb free at the end of your disk iirc) create it then for the partition type enter 'ef02' which designates it as a bios_boot, then install grub-pc and use grub-pc --target=i386-pc /dev/sda to install grub in legacy mode to the gpt partition table+bios_boot, and then you can boot in both modes
[16:31:48] <EriC^^> *grub-install --target=...../dev/sda

[16:34:09] <Xeonvl> hi all, im completely stuck with a server machine containing 2 5218R Xeons. The CPUs are stuck on 800Mhz. I have searched the internet and tried putting performance governor, then tried disabling disabling intel_pstate and manually enforcing a clock freq, I attempted to disable the PROCHOT thing but im not sure if I did it right

[17:13:52] <Xeonvl> well... checking, the command you gave me now gives 2100 for all cores
[17:14:02] <Xeonvl> but in i7z they are still at 800
[17:14:35] <Ravage> i dont know what i7z is but my command outputs the currently running core speed
[17:14:36] <hans> fwiw a lot of intel cpus "sleep" at 800mhz - a core that isn't really doing anything runs at 800
[17:14:42] <Ravage> so you should be fine
[17:14:45] <Xeonvl> i think it may be fixed
[17:14:55] <Xeonvl> because your command is giving me a nice mix
[17:15:01] <Xeonvl> some are at 800, some arent
[17:15:11] <Ravage> mix is good. the cores clock down when idle
[17:15:24] <Xeonvl> im gonna ask one of the guys to drop one of his spark bombs on the machine which led us to discover the issue
[17:15:36] <Xeonvl> because they were executing faster on a 6 core cpu from 2013

[18:59:02] <sybariten> well okay, maybe grub-pc would be a bit confuised cause it wants to operate in its "root environment" or something....?
[19:00:06] <EriC^^> sybariten: yeah, exactly, it's to install grub-pc, when you chroot this time you'll want to do "for i in /dev /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -R $i /media/newhd$i' done" so you have internet access in the chroot for apt

[20:33:30] <quba> Hello everyone. I am currently working with Ubuntu on GKE. My node there runs the 5.4.0-1054.57 kernel, and I would like to download the headers for it. My problem is that when I run `apt source linux-headers-$(uname -r)`, it fetches 5.4.0-1063.66 for me, which is the last available kernel for GKE. That obviously leads to issues when I build my
[20:33:31] <quba> kernel module. How can I fetch the headers for the kernel that I am currently running?

[20:39:16] <alkisg> Eh, you know, just find the version/variant you want from similar links
[20:39:54] <quba> Sorry, I guess I wasn't clear enough, I'm looking for the source packages for the headers
[20:39:57] <alkisg> There's also a release history page that you can use; the idea is that you download them from launchpad instead of with apt
[20:40:25] <alkisg> quba: search on launchpad for a minute, and if you don't find them, I'll search and find them for you
[20:40:38] <alkisg> quba: e.g. https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-gke/5.4.0-1063.66 => replace the version you want in the URL
[20:41:20] <alkisg> I don't think you want the source for the headers though. You want the binary header packages, which contain the linux source code
[20:41:28] <quba> yep, that looks good indeed, many thanks.
[20:41:55] <alkisg> I.e. you should download the headers.deb, not the headers.tar.gz

[20:44:36] <alkisg> Don't use apt source. Don't download the tar.gz. Go to https://launchpad.net/~canonical-kernel-team/+archive/ubuntu/ppa/+build/22237437 and download the linux-headers-5.4.0-1054-gke_5.4.0-1054.57_amd64.deb and linux-gke-headers-5.4.0-1054_5.4.0-1054.57_amd64.deb files.
[20:45:00] <alkisg> Then dpkg -i them, and you'll have your kernel sources, which are used to compile kernel modules

[20:47:17] <quba> Precisely!
[20:47:49] <alkisg> That doesn't make sense, officially the obsolete debs are deleted from the archives
[20:48:11] <alkisg> They're only kept on launchpad for posterity
[20:48:28] <quba> What I ultimately want is a `kernel-src.tgz` for the kernel I am running. Unpacking this should give me the linux source against which I can build my module.
[20:48:35] *** Joins: humberto1 (~humbertow@189.236.30.197)
[20:48:36] <alkisg> You should automate the UPDATE process instead, not the "download obsolete debs" process

[20:51:50] <alkisg> This is ensured by a just `apt install linux-gke` or `apt install linux-aws` etc; these also fetch the headers
