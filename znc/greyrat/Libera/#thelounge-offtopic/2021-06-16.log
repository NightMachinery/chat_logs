[12:15:20] <bookworm> aab_: by getting told on the first channel they ask to ask, from then on the case should be clear ;)
[12:15:49] <bookworm> everyone needs to learn it somewhere, no magic involved
[12:16:00] <bookworm> the not sticking around part on the other hand should be obvious
[12:16:02] <aab_> I'm in channels that doesn't happen I just ignore the messages till they just ask 
[12:16:07] <bookworm> time zones are a thing, real life too
[12:16:18] <aab_> people know no different lol
[12:17:04] <aab_> most of the time they just leave anyway lol
[12:18:11] <bookworm> people don't magically learn conventions if you don't educate them
[12:18:22] <bookworm> so telling them what to do would be the proper thing to do
[12:18:40] <bookworm> hence our factoid :)
[12:18:46] <aab_> awesome
[12:18:58] <bookworm> arch has similar in their bot
[12:24:24] <fnutt> "If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for staff or topic experts. Don't ask to ask or ask if people are awake or available. Just ask the question to the channel straight out, and wait patiently for a reply."
[12:24:43] <bookworm> phriks !ask?
[12:24:57] <fnutt> Found it somewhere else.
[12:25:05] <fnutt> But indeed, it's a ?ask command.
[12:25:06] <bookworm> I remember it a bit more rude
[12:25:22] <bookworm> >Don't ask to ask, if anyone is here or alive, or uses something. Just ask, and we'll get moving along. Thanks.
[12:25:34] <bookworm> Arch doing what's expected ;P
[12:25:55] <fnutt> I find my version slightly less rude.
[12:26:00] <bookworm> yes
[12:26:07] <bookworm> welcome is great too
[12:26:26] <bookworm> >Welcome to archlinux, tell us how you fucked up.
[12:26:45] <bookworm> I have to say I like that humor... others, not so much
[12:26:57] <bookworm> but it's right up my alley

[12:44:21] <aab_> maybe it needs an auto message then so when uses join it's automatically pushed to them lol
[12:44:33] <aab_> either as a DM or as a in-chat message
[12:44:36] <aab_> ha ha
[12:44:49] <fnutt> I like this one: https://www.nohello.com
[12:45:17] <aab_> everyone making their own rules up about irc 
[12:45:44] <fnutt> and if you disagree with someone and wants to tell them straight up what you think, link this: http://www.go-fuck-yourself.com/
[12:46:05] <aab_> ha ha
[12:46:37] <fnutt> Or you can tell them to shut up. http://www.stfu.se

[13:50:37] <bookworm> by some definition of never
[13:50:51] <bookworm> it's a meme, no need to be offended
[13:51:10] <bookworm> if you don't like that never google for demotivators, like not at all

[14:27:02] <aab_> so it's ok to make a meme that's nasty is it?
[14:32:03] <bookworm> yes?
[14:32:26] <bookworm> sarcasm and irony pretty much always do that, by definition
[14:33:13] <bookworm> as long as it's clear that it's meant in a humourous way there's no harm done
[14:33:44] <bookworm> depends on how sensitive the receiver is, as always when you communicate
[14:35:23] <bookworm> have you ever read the mad magazine? Or watched south park? Or any other likewise thing?
[14:35:52] <bookworm> almost all jokes there are offensive, that's the point
[15:14:41] <bl1nk> Good humor always punches upwards, never down, I would say
[15:18:00] <bookworm> I'd say differently, to each their own. Live and let live. If you encounter humor you don't like just ignore it
[15:18:40] <bookworm> there's lots of things on the internet I don't understand either, yet others find hilarious
[15:21:20] <bl1nk> Let's agree to disagree then :)
