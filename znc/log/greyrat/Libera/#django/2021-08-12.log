[02:02:00] <explore> guys this is a dumb question but are there.. books... or online guides.. on how to work with message queues and task queues? are there such books that focuses on how to take the long and async tasks that needs to be done on a web server and write them in pools of worker servers?
[02:02:24] <explore> my background is just a n00b webby so i don't know anything about this, i don't even know how to go about googling about this, any insight would be greatly appreciated

[05:11:08] <swiftslayer96> Hello everyone, I am working on a chat application and have a Conversation model that has a many to many field relationship with User. So it looks something like conversation.users.all(). I would like to perform a query to find a conversation between 2 user objects inside of a conversation. I am having some problems getting accurate here’s what I have tried so far: https://dpaste.org/kqGO
[05:33:38] <FunkyBob> swiftslayer96: are you wanting the rsult to be Users (B), or Convertaion (A) ?
[05:34:01] <swiftslayer96> FunkyBob: Conversation (A).
[05:34:10] <Matthias1> You have two users and want all conversations with both of them?
[05:34:16] <FunkyBob> if you want to find Conversations involving BOTH user1 AND user2
[05:34:31] <FunkyBob> you would use Conversation.objects.filter(user=user1).filter(user=user2)
[05:34:43] <FunkyBob> this will affect 2 joins to user
[05:35:28] <FunkyBob> because it uses two separate filter() calls
[05:35:42] <FunkyBob> using __in will only test if there are either user in the related set
[05:35:44] <FunkyBob> not both
[05:36:07] <swiftslayer96> FunkyBob: Ooh, that makes much more sense! You're a life saver lol I'm giving it a try now
[05:38:43] <swiftslayer96> FunkyBob: It worked! Thank you so much.

[05:47:41] <wallbroken> yes

[05:52:35] <wallbroken> i think should be fun
[05:52:51] <FunkyBob> if this is a ListView I think you can access the paginator directly... but that should work, too
[05:53:37] <wallbroken> yes
[05:53:39] <FunkyBob> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/class-based-views/mixins-multiple-object/#django.views.generic.list.MultipleObjectMixin.get_context_data
[05:53:43] <FunkyBob> yeah, paginator is there
[05:53:47] <wallbroken> i should have to take a look
[05:54:09] <wallbroken> now i'm busy because i'm fighting against mozilla development community staff
[05:54:33] <wallbroken> very rude people
[05:54:55] <FunkyBob> this seems to be a position you take often
[05:55:03] <FunkyBob> that it's everyone else being rude.
[05:55:09] <FunkyBob> I wonder why this keeps happening to you...
[05:55:45] <wallbroken> yes because it's a full of bug software
[05:55:58] <wallbroken> and i was coming offten to them telling the bugs
[05:56:16] <wallbroken> so they told me: we're busy. if you want, fix the bugs by yourself
[05:56:24] <wallbroken> but it's full of burocracy
[05:56:47] <wallbroken> but i learned javascript. and i'm fixing some of those bugs
[05:56:49] <wallbroken> for free
[05:57:32] <FunkyBob> welcome to open source... where it's mostly volunteers, and you're free to fix bugs
[05:58:06] <wallbroken> well. free software is not a good way to develop. because people do it in their spare time
[05:58:10] <FunkyBob> but it's been abused so much, it's develope bureaucracy as a defence mechanism
[05:58:42] <FunkyBob> there's so much wrong with that statement, I just can't.
[05:59:12] <FunkyBob> if you don't like it, don't support it... but you'll have a REALLY hard time not using free/open-source software
[05:59:28] <wallbroken> for example you help people when you are off loaded from your official paying work
[05:59:29] <wallbroken> right?
[05:59:41] <FunkyBob> yes
[06:00:49] <wallbroken> so a developement of a feature or fixing of a bug in your open source project is related of charge levels of your official work
[06:00:55] <wallbroken> is this a good thing for you?

[12:34:22] <loodoons> Hello guys
[12:35:14] <loodoons> Anyone here has already made a django application running in docker with docker-compose and using a mysql database?
[12:36:26] <dodo> what would you ask them?
[12:38:35] <loodoons> In the container I can connect to my database with the mysql debian client but Django always use socket :/
[12:38:51] <loodoons> Which leads to this error: Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'
[12:39:21] <loodoons> And the settings are correct: {'default': {'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql', 'NAME': 'dbname', 'USER': 'root', 'HOST': 'db', 'PORT': '3306', 'PASSWORD': 'toor'}}
[12:39:48] <loodoons> I think django doesn't understand the host "db" as a correct hostname
[12:41:57] <dodo> django doesn't resolve the hostname itself, that should just work
[12:42:13] <dodo> if i had to guess, you have some other setting somewhere else that overrides this one
[12:42:40] <dodo> grep your codebase for mysqld.sock ? though it could also be a typo if django defaults to the socket, unsure
[12:45:01] <loodoons> My database settings are these ones: DATABASES = {
[12:45:01] <loodoons>     "default": {
[12:45:02] <loodoons>         "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.mysql",
[12:45:02] <loodoons>         "NAME": os.getenv("DB_NAME"),
[12:45:03] <loodoons>         "USER": os.getenv("DB_USER"),
[12:45:03] <loodoons>         "HOST": os.getenv("DB_HOST"),
[12:45:04] <loodoons>         "PORT": os.getenv("DB_PORT"),
[12:45:04] <loodoons>         "PASSWORD": os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
[12:45:05] <loodoons>     }
[12:45:05] <loodoons> }
[12:45:18] <loodoons> And the result is what I send above :)
[12:45:54] <loodoons> I looked for mysqld.sock in the codebase but I found anything related to this
[12:46:57] <loodoons> I think it's a new bug because I found this guy that has the same issue: https://forums.mysql.com/read.php?10,696065
[12:47:32] <loodoons> He's using alpine and I'm using slim but we've got the same issue
[12:56:27] <dodo> next guess, your env is not set
[12:58:16] <loodoons> When I print the DATABASES variable from settings.py I see: {'default': {'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql', 'NAME': 'dbname', 'USER': 'root', 'HOST': 'db', 'PORT': '3306', 'PASSWORD': 'toor'}}

[14:35:45] <Spads> I have an old django 1.11 app that uses openid.  It's running in a gunicorn over http, and a separate server terminates SSL and sends traffic to it over a trusted network.  Unfortunately my openid.return_to keeps showing up as http instead of https, and I'm wondering how I can force it to use https.
[14:35:45] <Spads> All of the answers I can see online are about actually doing redirects to https, which we're happily doing from the SSL-terminating front end.

[14:41:47] <Spads> But how do I force reverse or build_absolute_uri to know we're https?
[14:43:46] <dre> Spads,https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/http/request.py#L183

[14:46:12] <knbk> Spads: usually the reverse proxy would send some kind of header, you can have Django pick that up using this setting: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#secure-proxy-ssl-header

[17:44:17] <GinFuyou> Nope, something definitely goes wrong when you "clear" it, if you say so
[17:47:39] <Bobbo> Any idea on where I can start looking? If I try to provide a custom form field, it stops rendering as a ClearableFileInput (even without changing the widget) and setting the widget seems to have no effect.
[17:47:49] <Bobbo> But maybe I'm not doing it right... Been too long since I Djangod.
[17:49:25] <GinFuyou> How you define the form, and what view does the processing? What happens if you clear via admin?

[17:52:56] <no_gravity> Good Afternoon
[17:55:04] <no_gravity> Anybody here runing a Django project that involves user accounts?
[17:56:46] <Bobbo> It's done through a custom framework, so it's probably dicking with it somewhere.
[17:57:21] <GinFuyou> Well, that's where you should have started then )
[17:57:45] <GinFuyou> no_gravity, likely, a bit fewer than everyone
[17:59:10] <no_gravity> I wonder which solutions you guys prefer for Django user accounts. Build something custom on top of django.contrib.auth or use something higher level?
[17:59:47] <hylje> nothing wrong with django.contrib.auth for the most part
[17:59:57] <hylje> deepest customizations i've done is custom auth backends

[17:59:58] <GinFuyou> There is only one solution for *Django user account* - built-in one
[18:00:16] <GinFuyou> Which solution suits *your* project, we can't tell without details
[18:01:20] <GinFuyou> I always roll a custom user model, then depending on the case
[18:02:20] <no_gravity> Building directly on top of django.contib.auth means to code the whole signup/login/signout/change_password/forgot_password/delete_acount stuff with all the "do you really want to ..." and "please confirm your email..." etc boilerplate, right?
[18:02:43] <GinFuyou> No, it doesn't
[18:03:25] <GinFuyou> Only if you from AbstractBaseUser changing basic stuff
[18:04:42] <no_gravity> GinFuyou: Then I am misunderstanding what django.contri.auth offers. If all of that comes with it, it needs templates, views, controlers and routes for each of these screens, right? How do I get those into my project?
[18:05:00] *** Joins: mattil (~mattil@dy561904gxgcj4s0nhpwt-4.rev.dnainternet.fi)
[18:05:26] <GinFuyou> It needs only templates I believe
[18:05:59] <GinFuyou> All basic stuff can be plugged just as described in docs
[18:06:32] <no_gravity> The way I read the docs means you have to build it all manually. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/auth/
[18:06:33] <GinFuyou> There are libs that provide a bit more over it, which one it was? django-registration-redux or something like that?
