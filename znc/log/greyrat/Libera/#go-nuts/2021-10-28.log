[02:57:55] <leitz> sdfgsdfg, go does concurrency well, and gives you a binary. You can usually cross-compile easily, IIUC.
[02:57:59] <foobaz> compared to python, it is much faster, and many bugs cause compile time errors instead of runtime errors
[02:58:04] <sdfgsdfg> gives you a binary ?
[02:58:17] <foobaz> which means it's much easier to detect bugs quickly
[02:58:32] <sdfgsdfg> everything compiles to a binary though, what do you mean
[02:58:37] <foobaz> python doesn't
[02:58:37] <sdfgsdfg> it compiles to portable binaries ?
[02:58:47] <sdfgsdfg> ahh ok
[02:59:07] <leitz> sdfgsdfg, it's compiled, whereas Python (and Ruby, etc) have to have a language runtime on the target machine.
[02:59:37] <foobaz> go is good for writing very reliable software slowly
[02:59:39] <sdfgsdfg> I wish they would import the collection operations of kotlin though, it's a really nice lang to develop with
[02:59:40] <leitz> It must be compiled for your OS/Arch combination, but you can copy in the binary and run it.
[02:59:53] <foobaz> whereas python is good at writing somewhat flaky software quickly
[03:00:00] <foobaz> both have their uses
[03:00:07] <sdfgsdfg> I've also seen go included as part of the gcc compiler ?
[03:00:18] <sdfgsdfg> there must be quite a nice sysadmin community behind it
[03:00:42] <leitz> There's almost three times as many jobs for Python as there are for Go, using Dice.com as a resource.  :)

[03:09:52] <foobaz> like go, rust is also good for writing fast and reliable software slowly

[04:47:44] <Sam> It is, but you don't need to call any of this from init. They're just normal functions, nothing here is magic. You can use them from wherever you want.
[04:48:18] <Sam> For example: https://play.golang.org/p/IUrVUwX8YaC

[04:52:43] <Sam> Sounds like you gave it a flag that wasn't recognized, like the error says. That doesn't have anything to do with where a function was called from.
[04:53:34] <Sam> For example, if you change the "-v" to "-a" (or whatever) in the example I sent, you will get the same error because there is no "-a" defined.
[04:55:11] <leitz> Right, but when I put the exact same StringVar lines in main(), it couldn't find it.
[04:55:29] <leitz> Find the flag. It's close to my nappy time.
[04:56:17] <Sam> Did you put them after Parse()? You have to define things before you parse the flags into them.

[05:01:23] <sdfgsdfg> yes
[05:02:24] <leitz> sdfgsdfg, okay, if I were awake I could explain this better. You asked about where Go shines, and I had a small concurrency  thing I wanted to try out.
[05:02:28] <leitz> https://github.com/LeamHall/webCheck/blob/master/cmd/main.go
[05:03:09] <sdfgsdfg> is this a http network filter
[05:03:10] <leitz> The data file is just two URLs. However, with Go's concurrency, a datafile of 1,000 URLs wouldn't take much longer than with 2.
[05:03:42] <leitz> It checks the status of a list of URLs. So the speed is determined by the network response.
[05:04:18] <leitz> If you did it in python, unless you did a lot of threads, your execution time would grow linearly with the number of hosts you're checking.
[05:04:55] <leitz> With Go's built in concurrency it doesn't take much longer than the single slowest remote site.
[05:05:16] <leitz> Such is my understanding, anyway. Smarter minds can explain it better.
[05:05:47] <sdfgsdfg> I guess go provides a language native way of creating and managing threads

[06:02:57] <leitz> On a different note, what took me two and a half hours in Go took me less than half an hour to write in Python, minus the concurrency stiff.
[06:03:01] <leitz> stuff.
[06:03:21] <leitz> And most of the go code was already written; I was doing a slight modification.

[06:05:53] <foobaz> have you set up gopls integration in your text editor? it might speed up your development
[06:07:22] <leitz> foobaz, just using vim. I'm just getting back into Go, and trying to learn what I can understand, a step at a time.
[06:07:55] <foobaz> gopls works great in vim, as you might expect considering so many go developers use vim
[06:08:03] <leitz> OKay, nappy time. See you all tomorrow.
[06:08:14] <foobaz> peace

[18:19:29] <seebs> so the good news is, expressions can't have side-effects, except if they're function calls, channel receives, [...]

[18:20:23] <seebs> yes, also channel receives are the other one i found
[18:20:38] <seebs> you can do stuff with analysis tools for this potentially
[18:21:13] <junon> You'd have to analyze all the way down to the standard library, and even then it's tricky to track side effects.
[18:21:47] <junon> Especially libraries that use unsafe pointers or FFI or the like, they'd have to mark which functions induce side effects - you wouldn't be able to infer this by looking at e.g. what invokes a syscall, for example.
[18:22:25] <junon> So it would have to be something built into the language, unfortunately. I was hoping there was some hidden Go-fu I could tap into.
[18:23:10] <junon> Unless you just outright ban function calls in the expressions, but that's less than useful in practice.

[18:27:10] <junon> Thanks for the info btw seebs :) Appreciated
[18:27:15] <seebs> it's not ideal, but it's the only real way to approach the thing, i think
[18:27:32] <seebs> i'd argue that every function call has side-effects even if none of the code in it has side-effects :P
[18:27:53] <junon> How do you figure?
[18:28:01] <seebs> stack growth etc
[18:28:18] *** haise01 is now known as haise01_
[18:28:19] <seebs> a function call is a risk in a way that local expression evaluation usually isn't
[18:28:27] <junon> Depends on the side effects you care about.
[18:28:50] <junon> I'm not worried about thread stack overflows in this case.
[18:29:13] <junon> well, underflows I suppose. Either way.
[18:29:28] <junon> But you're right, you'd have to kind of draw the line somewhere.

[19:31:25] <Sam> I literally just use the standard library logging.

[19:35:20] <Tv_> also the hierarchical style from the tracing world *really* helps if you have concurrent requests that log more than one line

[19:41:05] <Sam> Tracing is fine too; that's also a separate thing from logs IMO
[19:43:04] <Tv_> yes, but the nesting entries concept is useful outside of tracing
[19:44:58] <Sam> I suppose, but having functionality built in for that seems like unnecessary complication. I mean, I'll have logs prefixed by a request ID or something so I can grep out all the same request ones or what not, but I don't build that in in a special way

[23:07:55] <lungaro> b0nn, how? I first have to type switch to a *url.Error, which would be nil if it did not succeed. Then I have to use the ue.Err to typeswitch THAT to a OpError or DnsError
[23:07:57] <pinky_> thx
[23:09:22] <b0nn> lungaro: the two lines I pointed at, one is the closing bracket for if ok{}; the second is the opening of another if ok{}
[23:09:30] <lungaro> and to even make things worse, the OpError needs to be used after getting the url.Error, to find the dns error
[23:10:25] <b0nn> lungaro: I don't /know/ but I would look at a type switch for your errors, because that should clean up some of the ifs
[23:10:47] <lungaro> its the nesting that's really screwing me
[23:16:03] <b0nn> the nesting is because of wrapped errors?
[23:16:23] <Sam> url.Error implements unwrap, so you can use errors.Is/As to jump straight to any level and clean this up, I assume.
