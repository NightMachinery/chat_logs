[22:11:12] <dukwon> why is boost::regex so perverse?
[22:11:29] <dukwon> what are all these question marks?
[22:11:37] <dukwon> "formatter"???
[22:11:50] <Faux> Trying to be RUST.
[22:12:41] <Faux> Many regex libraries have perverse bits in so you can access the fast bits if you really need them. Knowing C++ people, they will have ignored the friendly api and built only the perverse bits, then tried to explain it as if the perverse API was the normal high level API you actually wanted.
[22:12:53] <Raziel> RUST: TRUST the CRUST. RUST PIZZA.
[22:13:30] <Faux> Haha, it uses string slices, and documents that you must manually check your borrows.
[22:14:43] <dukwon> i want to re-implement this in python https://lhcb-doxygen.web.cern.ch/lhcb-doxygen/davinci/v45r8/d7/db8/_escape_8cpp_source.html
[22:14:55] <dukwon> but i have no idea what this ?1 ?2 ?3 stuff is
[22:15:20] <dukwon> i think i understand the logic of what it's doing
[22:15:43] <dukwon> for each character: if \w, leave it alone, if ^~, replace with "anti", etc...
[22:17:52] <Faux> I mean, it's gotta be a backreference.
[22:18:04] <Faux> \1 \2 or $1 $2 in every other regex system.
[22:19:33] <Faux> Yeah, that's what it's doing.
[22:19:43] <Faux> Oh I see.
[22:19:46] <Faux> CLEVER.
[22:19:55] <Faux> It's not what it's doing, it's replacing it with literals, right?
[22:20:00] <Faux> That's what you said.
[22:20:06] <Faux> I dunno if that syntax exists in other things?
[22:27:30] <dukwon> i'm guessing not
[22:32:02] <T`aZ> I see 2 problems here
[22:32:15] <T`aZ> 1) working with regex
[22:32:23] <T`aZ> 2) trying to reimplement stuff in python
[22:33:37] <dukwon> there is a python binding for that function that i can access through some heavy environment loaded from CVMFS, but i'd prefer not to
[22:34:52] <dukwon> https://pastebin.com/YjAECAd9 this is what i have atm
[22:40:20] <dukwon> lol "anti-b-hadron" becomes "antiminusbminushadron", but i'm pretty sure it does that in the C++ too
[22:40:43] <dukwon> my goal is to faithfully replicate the existing shitty behaviour, not fix it
[22:41:47] <T`aZ> that's the spirit, adding more buggy code to the world
[22:42:35] <T`aZ> dont forget to port the unit test code too
[22:42:45] <dukwon> well, it doesn't break anything except human-readability
[22:42:57] <dukwon> and it's a non-use-case 
[22:43:26] <dukwon> the full list of particles defined a lot which are never used in the reconstruction
[22:43:31] <dukwon> such as neutrinos
[22:44:27] <dukwon> hmm ^~ actually denotes a SUSY particle, not an antiparticle
