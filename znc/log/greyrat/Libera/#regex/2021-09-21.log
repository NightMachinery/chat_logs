[00:22:11] <fandre1986> Cheers mate! Thanks a lot 
[00:22:30] <fandre1986> is better to use *+ rather than just * 
[00:23:03] *** Joins: gioyik (~gioyik@gateway/tor-sasl/gioyik)
[00:24:48] <fandre1986> I notice you put \s*+ , is the same as \s* , or you made it on purpose ?

[00:33:21] <purplex> yeah i just put them to be extra sure it doesn't waste any time going back and forth on wrong lines, some of them can be removed but maybe it doesn't hurt 
[00:34:25] <purplex> also since you said text between exits can be anything, i wasn't sure where to not use them
[00:38:19] <purplex> overall i think you need just these https://regex101.com/r/vRJXWJ/4 just not to over exaggerate things
[00:39:27] <purplex> now they will lock the lines, after checking them which makes more sense

[00:55:16] <purplex> fandre1986: what if 'port' appears twice? then you'll have a problem instead of optimization :p and that case change 'port' to 'exit' to be safe
[01:04:05] <fandre1986> Port will never appear twice but we can have more than one 'exit' in the context 
[01:05:18] <fandre1986> i.e https://regex101.com/r/5gcQjg/1
[01:06:10] <purplex> an exit only in line next to exit?
[01:06:47] <fandre1986> yes 
[01:07:16] <fandre1986> new context is open after you see 'create'
[01:08:13] <purplex> then it will be fine
[01:09:08] <fandre1986> I guess, I will keep the expression as the last one you sent me and make some postprocessing
[01:09:34] <fandre1986> is very hard to cover all cases 
[01:09:49] <purplex> i will change exit to exit\n to be sure in case you see words like exited
[01:17:09] <purplex> ok heres the problem why i added *+ because the software i'm using to test your regex demands *+ but regex101 optimizes it away :p
[01:18:09] <purplex> i suppose in your release code, it will be optimal as well
[01:20:02] <fandre1986> yep, no need *+
[01:20:18] <fandre1986> but as you good said, it does not hurt

[01:25:27] <purplex> actually if you know there are just '2', use {2} its better option

[01:31:17] <fandre1986> actually \K is quite handy here 
[01:45:07] <purplex> yea wasn't sure if you were using 're' module or, regex
[01:45:40] <purplex> until i added some *+ then i was sure you are on 'regex' module so i added \K

[18:20:53] <re101-fly-14> yes \K is supported i have used it
[18:21:32] <digitok> it would require a bit more than just \K
[18:21:45] <digitok> another option would be ensuring that "fff" does NOT follow, would that work?

[18:23:13] <re101-fly-14> so i did try the string in the application it did not work

[18:23:40] <digitok> check my previous question
[18:24:15] <re101-fly-14> could you elaborate on that, i did not quite understand what you asked
[18:24:41] <digitok> so instead of checking that the words are preceded by fff, we could check that they are NOT followed by fff

[18:25:01] <re101-fly-14> not that would be a problem i think

[18:25:23] <re101-fly-14> so in such a case if the sample string i gave ends with a fff nothing would match right

[18:37:57] <digitok> are you doing a replacement?
[18:38:40] <re101-fly-14> not replacement exactly, so the end result would be to apply a particular formatting on these found words
[18:39:10] <re101-fly-14> so the application works like you give it a grep and then you can tell it to do some text formatting on the search results
[18:39:18] <digitok> hmm
[18:39:32] <digitok> ok, well see what happens if you give it 07(?:fff|\G(?!^)).*?(Par|aphoto)
[18:40:16] <digitok> according to the docs, \G is supported, but it doesn't mention \K

[20:26:05] <OnlineCop> han-solo: `.*` and `.*?` will definitely cause backtracking. You may want to do something akin to `[^a-z]*[a-z]` in place of `.*?[a-z]`.
[20:28:30] <OnlineCop> han-solo: The look-ahead is probably fine. I would get rid of the non-lookahead stuff, though. As long as my password contains those minimal characters, why can't I use Unicode (who says Emoji aren't valid and hard-to-guess characters)?
[20:29:22] <OnlineCop> jowan: You won't be able to keep these values in separate capture groups unless you use some specific number of "optional" groups. Are you okay with them all being in a single group?

[20:32:08] <OnlineCop> han-solo: Pretty much. You've already verified that they meet the minimum requirements with the lookaheads. You shouldn't introduce a "maximum" requirement.
[20:32:17] <jowan> no , each of them should be in separate group

[20:33:08] <OnlineCop> No: `(?=[a-z]...)` should be `(?=[^a-z]*...`
[20:33:26] <OnlineCop> You're going to skip any non-lowercase letters, and finally, match a single [a-z].

[20:35:08] <OnlineCop> And as for `.*` before all those special characters: it will scan to the LAST character in someone's password, then back up 1 character at a time until it finds one of these characters.

[20:35:44] <perlbot> Don't put arbitrary restrictions on passwords! Use an entropy-based system like zxcvbn (https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn), and make sure to use modern hashes (md5 is too old; pbkdf2, bcrypt, or scrypt are better). (https://www.xkcd.com/936/)

[20:37:04] <han-solo> i remember that comic
[20:37:42] <OnlineCop> My password manager tends to make anywhere from 2 to 4 English words with a capital letter, and separates them with a hyphen. Meets the technical requirement, but it's long enough and random enough that I'd rather base my passwords off of high entropy.

[20:46:45] <han-solo> i wouldn't have figured .*[a-z] would create backtracking

[20:56:14] <OnlineCop> "Match words, then maybe whitespace" zero or more times.
[20:56:56] <OnlineCop> Let's say that you have "text[space]more_text[space]!!!!![space]"
[20:57:14] <OnlineCop> The first two repeats of this will match "text[space]" as you'd expect.
[20:58:02] <han-solo> yeah
[20:58:04] <OnlineCop> Once it hits the first '!', it will NOT match the `(\w+\s?)` so the next attempt will fail (which it's allowed to do because it already matched 0 or more times). Then it attempts to match end-of-line with `$`
[20:58:32] <OnlineCop> When that happens, the 2nd `(\w+\s?)` is re-evaluated.
[20:59:31] <OnlineCop> Because, maybe if one fewer of these characters is attempted, the `$` could match. But it doesn't, so it unwinds again and until until the entire group has been "unwound" and it tries with the first `(\w+\s?)`.
[20:59:50] <OnlineCop> So this is where some backtracking nightmares occur: those edge cases where it doesn't match like you expected.
[20:59:57] <han-solo> yeah
[21:00:17] <han-solo> i read perl doesn't have this problem, because they use NFA or something
[21:00:30] <OnlineCop> NFAs allow backtracking; it's DFAs that don't.

[21:00:49] <han-solo> oh, Okay
[21:00:50] <OnlineCop> A lot of atomic groups help turn your NFA closer to a DFA, since it prevents backtracking inside of it.
[21:01:49] <OnlineCop> If you had `(?>\w+\s?)`, then either the entire group matches the first time, or the entire group immediately throws "nope, can't match: failed to match" instead of going into it and trying to unwind its internal *'s and +'s.

[22:31:06] <purplex> slugs?
[22:31:48] <pajaroherido> yeah purplex
[22:34:11] <purplex> I see, what doesn't work? 
[22:34:57] <purplex> The /3 or /10 seems can also be a case
[22:35:17] <pajaroherido> I'd love to adjust it so it won't match only digits cases
[22:35:18] <pajaroherido> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69273579/non-digits-only-slug-regex
[22:35:33] <purplex> https://regex101.com/r/UC4XzD/1 <-- as you can see here
[22:35:44] <purplex> The slug /1
[22:37:29] <purplex> You can add (?!\d+$) in front to adjust
