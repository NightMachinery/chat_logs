[01:35:34] <twiclo> I've been given an Adobe XD layout that I need to implement onto the front end of a site I built. It has 4 different sizes of buttons all of which have their size hardcoded in pixels. I'm hesitant to use that because the look will change completely on different dispalys right?
[01:35:44] <twiclo> Should I avoid the pixel sizing or is that what everyone does?
[01:40:33] <eXtr3m0> Bishop_Bautista: here I did something similar: https://jsfiddle.net/0aou64vw/

[02:04:49] <eXtr3m0> twiclo good question. no easy answer. I found the best approach to set the content text font size on the html node in px and then use rem everywhere. you could use css custom properties to customize the buttons equally but also differently.
[02:05:33] *** Quits: hunboy (~hunboy@20014C4E10F9D900CD68AD18C57F17FC.dsl.pool.telekom.hu) (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.86.1 [SeaMonkey 1.1.19/2010022818])
[02:07:28] <twiclo> Rem?
[02:07:51] <eXtr3m0> Or even em locally inside the button. html { font-size: 14px; } button { padding: 0.5em 1em; } button.big { font-size: 1.5rem; }
[02:08:16] <eXtr3m0> rem uses the font size of the html node and multiplies it with the value
[02:08:38] <eXtr3m0> em does the same, but just for the font size in the local context.
[02:09:09] <eXtr3m0> I think the (default) button would also need font-size:1rem
[02:09:41] <eXtr3m0> html { font-size: 14px; } button { font-size: 1rem; padding: 0.5em 1em; } button.big { font-size: 1.5rem; }  button.big { font-size: 0.5rem; }
[02:09:47] <eXtr3m0> boom css framework with three buttons
[02:09:51] <eXtr3m0> xD
[02:10:27] <eXtr3m0> html { font-size: 14px; } button { font-size: 1rem; padding: 0.5em 1em; } button.big { font-size: 1.5rem; }  button.small { font-size: 0.5rem; }
[02:10:35] <eXtr3m0> forgot to change the classname.
[02:12:08] <eXtr3m0> twiclo: the main benefits I see with this approach are a) consistency, because you often have multiple of your base font size and b) you can just add a media query for mobile and lower the font size on html and all your elements will appear smaller.
[02:13:03] <eXtr3m0> with this tool you can transform em to px and vice versa by also defining the html font size in px. http://pxtoem.com/
[02:13:36] <eXtr3m0> but you would 80% of the time use rem.
[02:13:38] *** Quits: DrowningElysium (uid190788@user/drowningelysium) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[02:14:12] <eXtr3m0> because with em it's always dependant on the dom structure and you could get weird side effects. but for spacing insize a button its fine.
[02:14:26] <eXtr3m0> inside*
[02:14:51] <twiclo> I write backends and design databases. So excited to be thrown into this kinda stuff -_-
[02:15:42] <eXtr3m0> its kind of css normalization approach
[02:15:44] <eXtr3m0> <3
[02:16:57] <teear> em:s inherit from the parent element font-size rem from root element font-size
[02:17:20] <eXtr3m0> and parent inherits font size from parent
[02:20:02] <eXtr3m0> damn I'm so used to be able to edit my sent messages. irc is something else. :D
[02:20:03] <teear> The pixel equivalent of em changes everytime there is a parent with defined font-size
[02:20:49] <teear> it recurs?
[02:20:57] <teear> is that the correct word
[02:21:52] <eXtr3m0> and than can be bad if this parent also uses em. never do that really because that will go out of control easily. Sticking to rem very deeply into the dom I suggest. only really use em at the very end of your dom with your atomic pieces like an icon or list item.
[02:25:24] <eXtr3m0> Although via rem you can also reset that recursion teear was talking about. wasn't really possible before. rem is an pixel length css custom property equivalent.
[02:27:03] <teear> If you have everything in these relative units on the page you can nicely zoom the whole page using the root em via media queries
[02:27:17] <teear> or root rem
[02:28:01] <eXtr3m0> on the root it needs to be a pixel value, otherwise you're probably using the browsers default which sounds fun if its possible. :D
[02:28:31] <eXtr3m0> is ctrl+zoom actually doing net? I never cared to look.
[02:28:56] <eXtr3m0> Isn't this why px values used to not get resized via that value? Not sure, maybe I'm mixing up stuff.
[02:29:15] <teear> yeah
[02:29:44] <teear> nowadays browser zoom ctrl + +/- zooms also pixel values
[02:29:54] <eXtr3m0> Gotcha
[02:30:07] <teear> But it was not always so
[02:30:43] <eXtr3m0> Yeah I remember back in the days we said "ohh this page must be using CSS, I know because CTRL+zoom doesn't work!"
[02:30:45] <eXtr3m0> lol
[02:30:53] <eXtr3m0> We had not many debug tools.
[02:30:59] <teear> hehe yeah
[02:32:48] <teear> But if you use rem/em values in media queries you get the change from desktop layout to mobile layout also when zooming with ctrl +/- ?

[06:09:11] <quartz> pavonia: I'm not sure how to get that.
[06:09:24] <quartz> I only have the one image to work off of, which is what I"m trying to recreate
[06:10:25] <pavonia> See how I gave a width to the button in my sample, you do the same with the heart image too
[06:10:38] <quartz> Not sure how to get the images to load in codepen.io
[06:10:47] <quartz> Using <img src>
[06:11:38] <quartz> pavonia: It should be auto I'm guessing? I want it to be centered under the image of the guy
[06:11:41] <quartz> Like here: https://i.ibb.co/60tLTdB/image.png
[06:13:30] <pavonia> No, auto means "use the size of the image file"
[06:13:39] <quartz> Ahh
[06:13:42] <pavonia> Bu the image is obviously too big for your use case
[06:13:47] <pavonia> *But
[06:15:03] <quartz> Yeah true
[06:15:15] <quartz> Should I resize it in css or use <img src ?
[06:15:57] <pavonia> Well, both :D
[06:16:33] <quartz> Both? why?
[06:16:37] *** Quits: FlorianBad (~FlorianBa@cpe-67-49-107-16.dc.res.rr.com) (Quit: Client closed)
[06:17:42] <pavonia> The <img> tag adds the image, the CSS applies styles. You want both here
[06:17:54] <pavonia> Or maybe I don't understand the question correctly
[06:19:31] <quartz> Well, the heart image is too big
[06:19:48] <quartz> So I figured I could resize it in CSS, or use the height="20" or whatever in <img src

[06:22:07] <quartz> Stupid online class I paid for
[06:22:35] <quartz> "Google it and figure it out" is what the instructor tells everyone
[06:23:41] <pavonia> <img class="heart" src="..."> and .heart { height: 30px; }. This really is no rocket science
[06:24:35] <quartz> Yeah sorry I'm dumb

[06:31:32] <pavonia> No, sorry
[06:32:17] <pavonia> You can try copying the image URL and using that

[07:46:07] <Rockwood> but you are not using any div in that
[07:46:09] <Rockwood> why?
[07:47:04] <FunkyBob> why would they?
[07:47:23] <FunkyBob> quartz: how much bigger do you want the button?
[07:47:49] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, just asking
[07:47:52] <FunkyBob> Rockwood: though I do agree margins would probably be preferable to all those <br/>
[07:48:04] <Rockwood> i think they could be better i think
[07:48:44] <Rockwood> its not necessary but better
[07:49:05] <FunkyBob> using appropriate container elements and the like, sure...
[07:50:40] <Rockwood> thanks cya bye
[07:51:01] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, do you know php too?
[07:52:14] <FunkyBob> Rockwood: I've looked at it enough to knoiw I don't want to know more
[07:52:26] <Rockwood> ah
[07:52:29] <Rockwood> okay
[07:53:18] <Rockwood> actually my concern was about after refresh page how frontend fetch backed logged in session of backend
[07:53:52] <Rockwood> as you know i am using React with PHP
[07:53:52] <FunkyBob> that depends on how your site/framework decides to record logged in users
[07:54:04] <Rockwood> i am using laravel
[07:54:10] <Rockwood> its uses PHP
[07:54:27] <FunkyBob> for instance, django stores the current auth'd user in the session... and the session key is stored in a cookie
[07:55:14] <FunkyBob> so anyone on the client side can't tell from the cookie if the session is bound to an auth'd user
[07:55:38] <quartz> FunkyBob: Sorry I stepped away. I need the button to look like this: https://i.ibb.co/60tLTdB/image.png
[07:55:42] <Rockwood> https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sanctum#spa-authenticating i am trying this way
[07:56:05] <FunkyBob> quartz: so you want fully rounded ends, not squounds?
[07:56:17] <quartz> FunkyBob: Sure
[07:56:48] <Rockwood> give the width
[07:56:55] <Rockwood> to button
[07:57:17] <quartz> I'm not sure what is it. The image I posted is the only thing I have to go off of.
[07:58:02] <Rockwood> quartz, hire or try to learn
[07:58:14] <quartz> But the image needs to be centered under the main image above it
[07:58:18] <quartz> Rockwood: Yeah true
[07:58:32] <Rockwood> which one is yours way?
[07:58:45] <Rockwood> do you wanna learn things
[07:58:47] <Rockwood> ?
[07:58:57] <FunkyBob> quartz: as Rockwood and I were discussing before, your HTML lacks structure
[07:58:57] <quartz> Yes
[07:59:21] <Rockwood> make simple stuff before any thing complicated
[07:59:46] <FunkyBob> so many expressive HTML elements to choose from, and you've used, what, 5?
[08:00:03] <Rockwood> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps
[08:00:05] <FunkyBob> span, img, br, button... so 4
[08:00:27] <Rockwood> i think doesn't require many of there
[08:00:55] <Rockwood> quartz, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/How_CSS_is_structured
[08:01:42] <FunkyBob> adding "margin: 0 auto;" to the button will center it... but I don't think it will in the way you want
[08:02:01] <quartz> FunkyBob: So what should I do?
[08:02:09] <quartz> Ehhh forget lol. I need a break from this
[08:02:15] <quartz> Thanks anyway for the help.
[08:02:16] <FunkyBob> quartz: structure
[08:02:25] <FunkyBob> like that 'tinder' image... is a header, right?
[08:02:33] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, what do you mostly uses for backend?
[08:02:37] <FunkyBob> Rockwood: django
[08:02:52] <Rockwood> ah okay
[08:03:13] <FunkyBob> have been using it for... about 15 years or so
[08:03:32] <quartz> FunkyBob: yes
[08:03:34] <Rockwood> how to manage frontend logged in by backend?
[08:03:58] <Rockwood> session and cookies i think
[08:03:58] <FunkyBob> Rockwood: not that different to what that laravel doc says
[08:04:15] <FunkyBob> yes... I use the built in django auth machinery
[08:04:25] <Rockwood> axios.get('/sanctum/csrf-cookie').then(response => { i can start like this
[08:04:34] <FunkyBob> (in django, any endpoint handler can enforce a csrf cookie)
[08:04:38] <Rockwood> but hows on refresh?
[08:04:53] <Rockwood> yes laravel also having crsf
[08:05:02] <FunkyBob> well, in my recommendation, you should have an API endpoint for "current user"
[08:05:06] <Rockwood> csrf
[08:05:09] <FunkyBob> and start with a GET to get the current user details
[08:05:26] <FunkyBob> Rockwood: yes, but laravel appears to require you hit a special endpoint to set the CSRF token...
[08:05:42] <FunkyBob> so, GET t he current details... if that tells you user is not logged in... well...
[08:06:30] <Rockwood> by token fetch ?? i am right thinking
[08:06:35] <Rockwood> ??
[08:06:42] <FunkyBob> huh?
[08:07:25] <Rockwood> ask from session is it current user having any token if yes then fetch token from DB
[08:07:41] <FunkyBob> nope, you've lost me
[08:07:43] <Rockwood> ask from session is it current user having any token if yes then fetch token based user details from DB
[08:08:10] <Rockwood> on every refresh or ajax request
[08:08:47] <FunkyBob> ?
[08:09:05] <Rockwood> is it correct way for it?
[08:09:12] <FunkyBob> you're not making sense.
[08:09:33] <Rockwood> oops my bad english
[08:09:53] <Rockwood> let me try another way to explain you
[08:11:39] <Rockwood> request -> chk session if(user == sessionToken) {queryForGetdetailsUser(token)}
[08:11:54] <Rockwood> is it helpful?
[08:12:06] <Rockwood> hope you understand the concern now
[08:12:19] <Rockwood> am thinking correct now?
[08:12:34] <FunkyBob> not really, no...
[08:12:39] <Rockwood> then?
[08:12:57] <FunkyBob> I'm not sure what problem y ou're trying to solve that isn't already covered in t he document y ou linked to
[08:13:33] <Rockwood> its create on every request new one
[08:13:40] <Rockwood> like new login
[08:14:04] <FunkyBob> create what?
[08:14:09] <Rockwood> token
[08:14:13] <FunkyBob> what token?
[08:14:20] <Rockwood> csrf
[08:14:22] <FunkyBob> no
[08:14:37] <FunkyBob> as it says on that page, hit that endpoint once, and it will persist
[08:15:54] <FunkyBob> you will need to pass it with every ajax request, though...
[08:16:07] <FunkyBob> though, again, that depends on their CSRF machinery
[08:16:16] <FunkyBob> in django, it's not required for GET requests, for instance
[08:16:19] <FunkyBob> typically only POST
[08:17:01] <Rockwood> ok
[08:17:09] <Rockwood> now i get it now
[08:17:14] <Rockwood> thanks
[08:17:17] <Rockwood> bye cya

[23:32:46] <twiclo> Is is possible for me to make a button class? I want a button that has the same styling AND the same <i> in it at the same position. I just want every new "button" to be able to change the text of the button

[23:51:35] <hassoon_> sure you can do anything
[23:52:36] <twiclo> Would you guys recommend doing percentages for font sizes in a button so the text can adjust with the size of the button?
[23:52:43] <twiclo> Or are there unforseen problems with that?
