[14:40:08] <Ekkie> Hey, quick question. Does the "from src address" option for the "match ... action ..." directive support domains too? Or just IP addresses/subnets?
[14:43:58] <Ekkie> Asking because of a really niche use case. I have two servers in two home networks, each with a dynamic ip address, and I want to be able to send mails between them, without manually changing the ip address in smtpd.conf every day.
[14:47:40] <_inky> let me see i guess i used it that way
[14:48:12] <_inky> i have a rule:
[14:48:20] <_inky> match from any for domain "mydomain.tld" action "inbound"

[14:50:06] <Ekkie> That's almost what I have right now
[14:50:14] <_inky> satanist: i eventually solved my problem by commenting out login() function call in django's smtp.py implementation.
[14:50:28] *** Joins: scara (~user@user/scara)
[14:50:28] <_inky> Ekkie: works for me.
[14:50:31] <Ekkie> The problem is that that rule allows anyone to connect to your server and send mails to you
[14:50:51] <Ekkie> I only want my servers to send mails to eachother
[14:50:59] <Ekkie> So I would use something like...
[14:51:05] <_inky> hm. is it the case? not anyone, but anyone who can pass authorization.
[14:51:07] <_inky> no?
[14:51:20] <_inky> because in listen line you probably use auth.
[14:51:32] <Ekkie> match from src domain1.tld for domain2.tld action "inbound"
[14:51:49] <Ekkie> Oh I haven't thought about using auth
[14:52:11] <Ekkie> That would fix that, yes!
[15:09:40] <_inky> oh glad to be useful. it's also about opensmtpd, i am not usually useful in other projects, it has indeed very understandable syntax and man.
[15:09:56] <_inky> i just started using it last week.
