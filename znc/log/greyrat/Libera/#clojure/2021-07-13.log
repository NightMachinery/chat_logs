[15:36:38] <Para> "Elegant code" to me these days sounds something like it radiates the _idea_ that it's doing something terribly important in a prestigious manner but in reality the actual code paths don't even touch that part.
[15:37:11] <Para> Also this reminds me - I wonder if it was here or elsewhere where I once said that integrant seems to be the worst parts of Spring ported over to Clojure :)
[15:58:31] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Hi everyone. I am a luminus beginner writting a server application and just ran into a roadblock.
[15:58:31] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I am writting integration tests for my functionality, and when I post stuff to the server, they always return 404. 
[15:58:31] <yeik-the-spik[m]> The test example code that is generated with `lein new luminus my-app +services` fails when I try to run it from emacs using `C-c C-t n`.
[15:59:51] <ridcully> Para: it usually just takes a customer and some tight budget to get rid of any elegance quite quickly ;)
[16:00:10] <yeik-the-spik[m]> When I try to run the test code at the repl it returns the 404, but calling the methods from command line or the swagger-ui works fine
[16:00:30] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I would love to be pointed what am I missing out
[16:04:07] <ridcully> yeik-the-spik[m]: when i do `lein new luminus my-app +service` and `lein test` afterwards, those tests "work for me"
[16:04:32] <ridcully> is this with your code?  or are the default tests are failing too for you?
[16:15:29] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I am having trouble with the default tests. All method post test return 404. The call to `((app) (-> (request :post "/api/math/plus") (json-body {:x 10, :y 6})))` is of the form that gives me grief
[16:15:59] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I had a bunch of other flags other than `+services`
[16:16:58] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I would say that is more likely an error on my side than on luminus. I probably messed the config of something
[16:17:25] <yeik-the-spik[m]> btw, thanks ridcully 
[16:19:44] <ridcully> just to be on the safe side: its `service` (singular) - using `services` (plural) i got a lein error
[16:19:55] <ridcully> are you sitting on some old template?
[16:21:38] <ridcully> does it work using `lein test` for you?  since i am not an emacs user i can not comment on that front
[16:25:04] <yeik-the-spik[m]> `lein test` is not working. But I am getting more confident that I must have just messed something up creating a brand new project does pass all the tests
[16:25:20] <yeik-the-spik[m]>  * `lein test` is not working. But I am getting more confident that I must have just messed something up. Creating a brand new project does pass all the tests

[17:17:58] <sobel> EdwardIII: C/C++/Java/Go/python/perl
[17:18:07] <sobel> mostly ECMA family
[17:19:44] <EdwardIII> perl is your favourite of course
[17:19:57] <sobel> catch me on #perl
[17:20:31] <EdwardIII> :D i actually really enjoyed using perl, catalyst, and learning from the folks on #perl
[17:20:48] <sobel> i've heard only the best about core perl community
[17:21:51] <EdwardIII> really smart people, and nice
[17:22:00] <EdwardIII> although mst did jokingly hit me on the head once
[17:22:26] <sobel> all the languages i still like offer functional libraries so it's not like i have to give up *that* much outside of clojure anymore but i'm totally spoiled by sexps and edn is a close second
[17:22:39] <sobel> that's the thing about mst
[17:22:43] <sobel> you're gonna get troutslapped
[17:22:54] <EdwardIII> :D
[17:22:58] <sobel> he's one of the good ones
[17:26:36] <EdwardIII> sobel: which functional libs do you use with python?
[17:27:13] <sobel> i don't use python anymore but i'm pretty sure i recall seeing it had at least one
[17:34:17] <sobel> right now i'm doing a java+javascript project, but i got tricked into it. now i know how to detect a kickoff happening without me, and the next one will probably be cljs+clojure or java, depending on whether i reuse the backend
[17:41:49] <EdwardIII> haha tricked into javascript you say, grounds for divorce
[17:43:59] <sobel> i didn't know enough React to teach a newbie clojurescript mid-project

[17:45:45] <EdwardIII> yes, you're quite brave introducing clj/cljs if you need to teach it to someone or everyone :)
[17:46:59] <sobel> if i hire right i don't
[17:47:39] <sobel> see: kickoff happening without me
[17:48:46] <EdwardIII> i enjoy it though, love a bit of good in-house mentorship
[17:49:44] <sobel> i haven't had a worse peer in almost 25 years. i don't get how a recent EE grad thinks he knows react but really isn't clear on JS syntax a year into what is probably his 3rd post-college gig
[17:50:14] <sobel> i'd love a mentee that wasn't learning the same lessons on repeat
[17:55:34] <EdwardIII> heh to an extent i can relate
[17:55:52] <EdwardIII> that's what you have to get them to write code in interviews, eh?
