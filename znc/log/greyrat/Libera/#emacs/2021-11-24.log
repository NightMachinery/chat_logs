[04:16:14] <bpalmer> why should regions ever go away? The experienced editor knows where the mark was last set and can take advantage of it to efficiently transform the buffer.
[04:17:15] <bpalmer> simultaneously, you have less "magic" where keystrokes do different things depending on whether you just set the mark or did something in between.
[04:18:55] <gabbiel> so marking is more for using commands on the mark? do these commands work with the point in mind at least??
[04:18:55] <fsbot> It is certain!
[04:19:29] <yeti> rly???
[04:19:30] <fsbot> Yes!
[04:20:03] <gabbiel> with transient mode i can see the region, but non transient I can't figure out how to for example, kill some text

[04:24:30] <bpalmer> I never found a huge difference either way.
[04:25:38] <bpalmer> (In part, because you can always activate a region with C-x C-x even after transient mark mode has made it go away, it's never far away)

[06:23:25] <trevoke`> hey folks, I'm trying to create a loop that'll allow people to operate on a temp buffer (specifically, a recursive edit and then a choice, whether read-multiple-choice or a tangent menu). I sort of thought that I should be able to do that with with-current-buffer-window, but the only success I've had so far has involved using switch-to-buffer, which seems a .. less elegant solution. Is there a better way?
[06:29:14] <trevoke`> I forgot to mention - what *does* happen is that when control is returned to the user, it always returns to the buffer/window where the point was when I called the code. The only way I can get the active buffer to be the temp buffer I created is with the active switch-to-buffer.

[06:36:32] <aidalgol> Hmm, actually it *does* appear to be using the identity file, but then it just hangs.
[06:37:08] <aidalgol> Because trying to log in via the terminal immediately after aborting the TRAMP connection, it had that key in the agent's cache.
[06:37:12] <aidalgol> (It did not before that.)
[06:37:25] <aidalgol> And the last item in the bash history was TRAMP's weirdness.
[06:37:42] <aidalgol> So how can I figure out why it's hanging?
[06:40:18] <shrysr> could be due to pinentry. I had the same issue of emacs hanging while accessing a ssh bookmark yesterday after a debian system update. was miraculously resolved by installing seahorse, which also installs a pinentry gui program 
[06:40:45] <aidalgol> My agent does not seem to be using pinentry.

[15:39:58] <didi> taeaad: I think all these so called "web apps" do it.
[15:40:06] <Nselm> rnkn It depends on the kind of words you want. You could use wikipedia-pages, or something like project gutenberg / project gutenberg australia, which offer plaintext files. There is some kind of "free-old-books-service" out there for most bigger languages. Another possibility would be internet archive. For convenience, peter norvig has some of
[15:40:07] <Nselm> those older works (think sherlock holmes) already bundled in one file https://www.norvig.com/big.txt. All of those are fairly old-fashioned, however, so if you want more modern stuff, wikipedia may be best. Btw, if you use python, the Counter function from collections is really useful for stuff like this. (Generally, for this kind of small
[15:40:07] <Nselm> text-handling python is really neat)

[21:16:45] <pjb> trevoke`: well, the general principle is to avoid mode in user interaction.  This means that you should not write this code keeping the control of the flow (ie don't use a loop), but instead, set up data and buffers and commands, and let the user interact with the normal event loop, and possibly give a command that will have you make a transition to the next step.
[21:17:06] <roadie> latex orgies tend to get out of hand yep
[21:17:10] <Tisoxin> Has sb a command to quickly evaluate the setq around one's point?
[21:17:13] <pjb> trevoke`: so you will also avoid with-temp-buffer and other such macros that do and undo stuff in the same control structure.
[21:17:32] *** X-Scale` is now known as X-Scale
[21:17:34] <sachac> trevoke` : you might be able to use recursive edits
[21:17:44] <pjb> trevoke`: instead, you can make a work buffer "*edit heading*" for example.
[21:18:30] <pjb> I would avoid recursive edits too. Notably in this case, it seems easy enough to do it tracking the current state in the data structure you want to walk.
[21:18:37] <sachac> oh, you already are
[21:19:11] <trevoke`> pjb: Okay, so help me solve this. I want to help a user focus on every single heading in a given file (think GTD inbox, that's what it is) and help them process it (think GTD processing, that's what it is) somehow. How do I do tihs in emacs?
[21:19:40] <sachac> trevoke`: I would probably use narrowing
[21:19:47] <sachac> so you're working in the same buffer
[21:20:08] <trevoke`> sachac: the existing implementation is exactly that, but I'm running into an occasional bug where the processing skips headings, even with org-map-continue-from
[21:20:34] <sachac> I wonder if it's because point has moved

[21:21:24] <pjb> trevoke`: also, when you take a step back, what you have specified here is just the editing of an org file.  What does your code bring to the user, beyond the corset?

[21:22:13] <trevoke`> sachac: org-map-continue-from is a point position so that org-map-entries can continue properly, it's supposed to prevent that
[21:22:14] *** Joins: capfredf (~capfredf@c-68-51-122-2.hsd1.in.comcast.net)
[21:22:24] <pjb> Yes, it's quite possible that org-map-entries doesn't assume the org buffer can be modified.
[21:22:30] <trevoke`> pjb: it does
[21:22:37] <trevoke`> pjb: it's in the documentation for the function
[21:22:54] <trevoke`> pjb: if you would like an answer to the above question, I refer you to the code for the package at https://github.com/Trevoke/org-gtd.el/
[21:23:20] <pjb> No, it does not; It's written explicitely: Under some circumstances, this may not produce the wanted results.  For example, if you have removed (e.g. archived) the current (sub)tree it could mean that the next entry will be skipped entirely. 
[21:23:22] <sachac> hmm, neat :)
[21:23:46] <trevoke`> pjb: yes, note the part where it says "use org-map-continue-from to set the point where needed so it continues properly"
[21:23:52] <pjb> To use org-map-continue-from, you would need to set a marker after the top-level entry, to continue after it.
[21:24:16] <sachac> trevoke`: I wonder if you can narrow down when the skipping happens
[21:24:40] <trevoke`> pjb: your reasoning so far is flawless
[21:24:44] <pjb> trevoke`: but again, the fundamental question is what does your code bring to the user?
[21:24:54] <pjb> Why can't the user just go around the org file and edit it?
[21:24:57] <trevoke`> pjb: I think maybe I don't understand your question
[21:25:17] <sachac> trevoke`: I can see why it would be useful to have something that makes it easier to focus on one thing at a time. :)
[21:25:23] <trevoke`> Ah, uh, the actual value add is unimpeded focus on a single heading at a time
[21:25:35] <pjb> You're forcing the user to edit the toplevel headings in order.  but what if the user wants to edit section 3 before section 2, and then section 5 and 7 and then 1?
[21:26:03] <trevoke`> pjb: that doesn't make a lot of sense given that it's the GTD inbox
[21:26:22] <pjb> trevoke`: as a user, what I do in general is to collapse all the headers, and only open the one I'm working in.
[21:26:25] <sachac> trevoke`: minor mode with a keybinding that widens, goes to the next heading, and narrows?
[21:27:10] <pjb> So, S-TAB, and TAB on the header I want to work.  Then S-TAB, and I TAB on the next header.
[21:27:10] <sachac> (or just a regular keybinding, doesn't have to be a minor mode)
[21:27:11] <trevoke`> sachac: manageable, so essentially I'd be reimplementing org-map-entries myself anyway?
[21:27:26] <pjb> trevoke`: this could indeed be combined with a narrow-to-region.
[21:27:35] <trevoke`> pjb: well I'm very glad that you have no issues focusing on a single heading when there's 40 or more of them you have to work on all sharing the screen space
[21:27:48] <sachac> trevoke`: you don't have to commit to org-map-entries up front, yeah. you can use one of the commands for navigating to the next heading

[21:29:53] <pjb> So the user could explicitely ask the narrowing, specifying a node (moving the cursor on a header), and go to the next or the previous, or back to the whole document with M-x widen RET
[21:30:28] <trevoke`> Sure. Another thing I'm trying to avoid is letting emacs exist as a source of easy distraction during the inbox processing flow, which makes a lot of your suggestions, while fantastic implementation ideas and all much closer to the zen of emacs, antithetical to the idea of helping with focused work
[21:30:53] <pjb> Yes, the key word here is antithetical.
[21:31:04] <trevoke`> Alright well thanks for the help then?
[21:31:33] <pjb> trevoke`: try to use a marker to compute the org-map-continue-from in stag-process.  That should help you do what you want.

[21:35:26] *** Joins: toto_ (~toto@5.146.194.60)
[21:35:43] <pjb> The way markers work, is that if text is inserted or deleted before the marker position, it is updated to always point to the same character in the buffer.
[21:36:34] <pjb> So you want to track the end of the current element, to let the user edit it, inserting or removing text.  Then you can continue from this end position, updated.
[21:37:04] <pjb> markers need to be "freed" by setting them to nil, otherwise the buffer will keep them.
[21:37:50] <pjb> Now to exit from the loop early (from user choice), you can use block and return-from from cl. (or cl-block and cl-return-from from cl-lib).
[21:38:26] <sachac> trevoke`: you've probably edebugged org-map-entries to see how it uses org-map-continue-from and what's happening with your heading... what did you find?

[21:42:04] <sachac> edebug is well worth getting the hang of
[21:42:12] <trevoke`> pjb: is a marker like a point position, like .... 478? or is it something like ... row and column.. ?
[21:42:37] <pjb> trevoke`: if you consider the file can be deleted or recreated in the background, you may want to use org-map-entries to save the whole entries in a list first, then give them to edit to the user, save the new version, and in the end, recrete an org buffer from scratch concatenating the saved sections.
[21:42:41] <sachac> you can initialize it with a point position, but it moves if there are insertions or deletions
[21:43:02] <pjb> trevoke`: it's a point position + a buffer that contains it.
[21:43:32] <sachac> doing what you want to do in the same buffer is probably a good idea in case the user has file-specific options
[21:43:39] <trevoke`> pjb: okay, so if a heading is removed, the marker could point to something... different? like it could skip a heading completely if the next heading were short enough?

[21:56:43] <trevoke`> pjb: yes, agreed, the read-multiple-choice thing is just convenient because the user doesn't have to memorize a bunch of function names or keybindings, they're just displayed right there (similar logic to what magit provides for you really)

[22:14:56] <trevoke`> heh, thanks. I guess I'm still and forever stuck in the question of whether I'm gonna go against the zen of emacs with this package or not.. For now I guess I need to prepare myself mentally to actually step through the org code and not just read through it
[22:15:31] <trevoke`> I'm actually wondering if I can just set org-map-continue from to the top of the buffer since, by virtue of how the flow works, the top heading is always gonna be the next one I want to work on anyway...
[22:16:19] <pjb> trevoke`: you will be looping on the same header.
[22:16:31] <trevoke`> pjb: no, because I am always refiling or archiving
[22:16:40] *** Quits: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi) (Client Quit)
[22:17:29] <trevoke`> anyway, I must go afk for now, thanks for feeding my mind with tools, ideas and perspectives
[22:17:33] <bpalmer> refiling or archiving involves removing the header to a different file?
[22:17:42] <trevoke`> yes, always
[22:17:50] <trevoke`> in this flow, specifically
[22:18:10] <bpalmer> then that soudns like it would work
[22:18:32] <trevoke`> *nod* I'll have to give that a shot, it might be the simplest bugfix while I work on a cleaner solution. Thanks.
