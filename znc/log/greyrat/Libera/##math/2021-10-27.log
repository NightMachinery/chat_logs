[00:35:21] <isekaijin> My bad, you just said that.

[00:46:33] <isekaijin> If you have a polynomial in two variables f(x,y) with coefficients in R, you can consider the points (a,b) in R^2 such that f(a,b) = 0.
[00:46:37] <Guest76> yeah and those constants come from a field
[00:46:45] <isekaijin> But you can also consider the points in (a,b) in C^2 such that f(a,b) = 0.

[00:47:13] <isekaijin> (Okay, the last one is not terribly common.)

[02:46:32] <[-_-]> What are they trying to say here?

[02:47:48] <[-_-]> I am trying to get to same conclusion but from taylor series
[02:48:18] <[-_-]> I mean I want to start with taylor series instead of laurent series and then drop positive powers
[02:48:27] <PlanckWalk> If the original series in negative powers converges, then so does the Taylor series in y.

[02:49:57] *** Joins: mornfall (~mornfall@user/mornfall)
[02:50:29] <PlanckWalk> It may be the case that the Taylor series converges everywhere, which is a case missing from the original.

[02:52:12] <[-_-]> I do not understand how the r^-1 comes, and what would it mean if that is the taylor series
[02:52:48] <[-_-]> It looks like we took a infinite series that looks like taylor series and are saying that it is a taylor series
[02:52:59] <PlanckWalk> It's saying that there exists some r such that the series in y converges when |y| < r and fails to converge for |y| > r.
[02:53:22] <[-_-]> that makes sense
[02:53:33] <[-_-]> but (z-z_0)^-n
[02:53:40] <[-_-]> -n is not in taylor series

[02:54:06] <PlanckWalk> y = (z - z_0)^-1,  so  (z - z_0)^-n = y^n  for all n

[02:58:00] <PlanckWalk> Once you rename it, you see "oh, that's just a power series, I know what convergence behaviour they have"
[02:58:01] <[-_-]> But the -inf
[02:58:19] <[-_-]> In the link it says n>0
[02:58:30] <[-_-]> So that doesn't match a taylor series

[02:58:39] <[-_-]> ?
[02:58:53] <[-_-]> http://0x0.st/-dFZ.jpg
[02:58:54] <PlanckWalk> What doesn't match a Taylor series?
[02:59:07] <constxd> Kings... am I crazy? This is non-separable, right? The answer key says it's separable: y' + y^3 = 4
[02:59:15] <PlanckWalk> A series starting with n=1 just means that the first term in the Taylor series is 0
[02:59:26] <PlanckWalk> Which is perfectly well allowed and doesn't affect convergence
[03:00:00] <PlanckWalk> constxd: Yes, that's separable
[03:00:12] <[-_-]> 0 to -inf
[03:00:14] <constxd> Ok then clearly I don't know what separable means
[03:00:21] <[-_-]> how can I have n>0 in that?
[03:01:00] <constxd> I thought for it to be separable you have to be able to write it in the form: N(y) * y' = f(x)
[03:01:13] <PlanckWalk> [-_-]: y^n corresponds to (z-z_0)^-n
[03:01:24] <PlanckWalk> constxd: Yes, and you can
[03:01:50] <PlanckWalk> N is allowed to have fractions, and f can be constant
[03:01:56] *** Joins: pluri (~pluri@user/pluri)
[03:02:58] <constxd> how can you multiple y' by a function of y and end up with y' + y^3?
[03:03:01] <PlanckWalk> [-_-]: If you prefer, then make the explicit substitution m = -n
[03:03:03] <constxd> multiply*
[03:03:18] <PlanckWalk> constxd: You don't
[03:03:45] <PlanckWalk> Nothing says that you have to
[03:03:54] <constxd> So what is N(y)?
[03:04:00] <constxd> f(x) = 4
[03:04:06] <PlanckWalk> No, not f(x) = 4
[03:04:30] <PlanckWalk> Well, I suppose you *could* choose f(x) = 4.
[03:04:48] <PlanckWalk> But that would be silly and misleading
[03:05:12] <constxd> What's the obvious choice?
[03:05:50] <PlanckWalk> y' + y^3 = 4  iff  y' = 4 - y^3  iff  y' / (4 - y^3) = 1, that is  (1/(4-y^3)) y' = 1.
[03:06:33] <PlanckWalk> So yes, you *could* write it as  (4/(4-y^3)) y' = 4
[03:06:48] <PlanckWalk> And then your f(x) = 4, but the LHS isn't  y' + y^3
[03:07:07] <[-_-]> PlanckWalk: thanks, that was the answer

[03:16:43] <[-_-]> ah...okay

[03:17:42] <[-_-]> Is this correct?
[03:18:01] <PlanckWalk> Yes

[04:45:02] <johnkeats6> and there's nothing special about binary here, it's the same idea for any base, so think about base 10 since you're more used to it
[04:45:26] <PlanckWalk> Be careful to not accidentally write a proof that would work with base 2, but digits 0,1,2 ;-)
[04:45:36] <PlanckWalk> Well, "work"
[04:45:43] <cuppajoeman> For base 2 I know that you can divide by two i times to remove i digits from the right
[04:45:50] <cuppajoeman> you can always get the final digit by going modulo 2

[04:47:26] <JennyfromTheBloc> to my previous point, I think almost all functions can be derived from surjective functions (example almost all differentiable functions have an nth derivative that is surjective ) similar for continuous ... even if theyre not surjective you can find a related one that is when restricted is your function. finding functions that are not surjective

[04:54:16] <cuppajoeman> PlankWalk: Base Case n = 0, they differ at the rightmost digit, one is even the other odd, therefore the numbers are different. Ind. Step assume "every two string that differ for the first time at index k produces two different natural numbers", want to show  " [...]  k+1 [...]", consider two strings s1 s2 that differ f.t.f.t at index k+1, we can modify the string to remove the last digit from each, they now differ for the first time at
[04:54:16] <cuppajoeman> index k, so we use IH so the two numbers represented by the modifications are different, to get the representation of our original strings, we multiply by two and possibly add 1, in either case you get two different numbers again, because you did the same operation on both sides?

If I have line bundles at my disposal, this is easy: pull back O_{P^n}(1) to P^m to get some O_{P^m}(d). Then f is defined by n homogeneous polynomials of degree d on m+1 variables, with no common zeros besides the trivial one. This is only possible if d = 0, so we are done.

[09:34:22] <tusko> Right, so in this case we're flipping a coin 1000x. If we get 525 heads we say its biased, otherwise its fair. If the coin is biased we should get 550 heads (and 500 if it is fair).
[09:34:34] <tusko> So, say the coin is fair. Our probability of making an error is P{X_fair >= 525}.

[09:35:42] <PlanckWalk> tusko: You're still not being careful.
[09:35:52] <tusko> I suppose that makes sense, since 524.5 gets more of the area after the point where we would have called it a fair coin.

[10:41:40] <ronox> qergle, yes, theres many, but they dont specifically state what or how influences what
[10:41:47] <tusko> https://imgur.com/a/UDtF3K6
[10:42:03] <ronox> for example, the only source i currently have states that the frequency deviation is entirely the amplitude of the sin function
[10:42:30] <ronox> but then what about the frequency of the sin function
[10:43:05] <ronox> this being, the sin function inside the cos function for the carrier

[10:44:20] <ronox> i have another example i dont quite understand, which doesnt use cos or sin functions, it just says, the carrier is A, the message is B frequency
[10:44:47] <ronox> which doesnt carry over to my own problem
[10:45:49] <qergle> the frequency of the interior sin is affecting its amplitude, but it's effect on the shift of the outer is only the amplotude.

[10:47:23] <qergle> in the time dimension, the interior sine amplitude is a function of time given its frequency parameter
[10:47:33] <qergle> or if it were a true message, the message encoding
[10:49:02] <ronox> the reason its sin, a perfect message is because this problem is about working out bandwidth ultimately, which requires knowing hard frequency ranges. for something like audio you already have it set to some specific numbers

[14:27:14] <int-e> jmorris: it hardly matters anyway, the difference to the closed formula is about 8 bucks. Which is a bit more than expected (the loss should be about half the dividend from a single share over the period)
[14:27:54] <jmorris> oh yeah
[14:27:57] <jmorris> it shouldnt make a difference
[14:28:07] <jmorris> since the shares are cheap

[14:29:45] <int-e> so in light of the ridiculoud simplification in all other aspects of the problem (fixed dividend, fixed share price, lack of any fees) this should just be ignored
[14:30:41] <int-e> Hmm "ridiculoud" is kind of neat (though it doesn't fit into this context)
[14:31:29] <acresearch> int-e: i am not trying to calculate an actual stock, i am just trying to figure out this "snow ball effect" is it is realistic, it does not seem to be realistic,    of course i did not put into account more accurate details,   but even with rounding numbers   there is no snow ball effect, i just grows linearly

[14:33:00] <jmorris> well its obviously not linear
[14:33:02] <int-e> anyway, short-term exponential growth looks linear; e^x ~ 1+x for small x.
[14:33:04] <jmorris> but also 100k isnt a lot

[14:33:52] <acresearch> int-e: true, not linear, but you just said it,   it is true that it is "technically" exponentail,   but the growth is soooo small it is almost linear,
[14:33:55] <int-e> With those numbers it'll double every 23 years (rounded to the nearest integer)
[14:34:31] <jmorris> acresearch: doubling every 23 years is very good
[14:34:55] <jmorris> i dont know why you're insisting on it being linear
[14:34:59] <jmorris> but yeah
[14:35:00] <greenbagels> they aren't
[14:35:00] <jmorris> it's not linear
[14:35:18] <jmorris> greenbagels: they said its "almost linear"
[14:35:19] <jmorris> but its not
[14:35:34] <acresearch> jmorris: yes,   but if you are an average person, doubling your income from 500 to 1000 after 23 years     this barely has any effect given the length of time   right?
[14:35:48] <jmorris> um
[14:35:54] <jmorris> why not?
[14:36:04] <greenbagels> acresearch: if you're an average person you don't just invest 500 and expect magic after 23 years
[14:36:36] <acresearch> jmorris: especially that you are investing 100% of your returns
[14:36:55] <jmorris> i dont really know what you're saying
[14:37:10] <jmorris> doubling your money in 23 years is pretty god

[14:38:40] <jmorris> well
[14:38:43] <jmorris> with inflation
[14:38:47] <jmorris> its worth like 110000
[14:38:52] <jmorris> after the 23 years
[14:39:37] <acresearch> jmorris:      if you are rich, maybe yes, doubling 10,000,000 into 20,000,000 would have a significant effect on your life,    but if you are average person doubling 1000 to 2000 after waiting 1/4 or 1/2 your life is not significant    you get my point of view?
[14:39:48] <jmorris> yeah and?
[14:40:03] <jmorris> 1000 dollars isn't a lot of money
[14:40:10] <jmorris> you probably shouldnt be gambling it in the market
[14:40:30] <acresearch> so the concept of investing to and re-investing your dividend for 20-30 years only works for rich people, not normal people
[14:40:31] <W> "Indeed, if one calls the set a /can/ and the arcs /worms/, then posing a worm problem is truly opening a can of worms." sometimes the love of wordplay goes too far (Sectorial Covers for Unit Arcs by John E. Wetzel & Wacharin Wichiramala)
[14:40:48] <jmorris> acresearch: most people have more than 1000 but
[14:40:49] <jmorris> yeah
[14:41:08] <greenbagels> W: lol
[14:41:15] <jmorris> if you only have that much money you should focus on getting payed i guess
[14:41:32] <acresearch> jmorris: which is not what many of the online videos are talking about,,, they claim that if you invest today you can live of dividend 20-30 years later
[14:41:49] <acresearch> , if you invest some of your money and not even re-invest 100% of it
[14:41:57] <W> acresearch, I would suggest not watching videos about getting rich
[14:42:03] <jmorris> well to be fair
[14:42:04] <acresearch> W: haha
[14:42:12] <jmorris> you wouldn't just invest a lump sum and call it a day

[15:39:21] <Sofia> The objective is to be able to change all: a, b, k, and j. Such that for each step in j, the cut region has equal area.
[15:39:43] <Sofia> If anyone knows how to render for all j in desmos, that'd also be nice.

[15:59:57] <Sofia> AFAICT I have this much correct.
[16:00:21] <greenbagels> ok here's my actual question
[16:00:28] <greenbagels> what is actually your goal? what are you setting out to achieve here?
[16:02:25] <[itchyjunk]> I tried to turn this into a quadratic and use the formula to find the roots but it didn't work out well. not sure what else to try :: https://i.imgur.com/sqSOdYH.png
[16:02:42] <[itchyjunk]> I still think quadratic is the way to go, but just turned into a mess
[16:03:38] <Sofia> greenbagels: The goal is to balance the splits such that the area can be recursively subdivided. This is towards subdivision approaches for rendering arbitrary closed-form implicit surfaces. In this case to render a 2D ellipse, or more generally an N-dimensional ellipsoid.
[16:03:46] <PlanckWalk> sin(x + iy) = sin(x) cosh(y) + i cos(x) sinh(y)  or something.
[16:04:52] <PlanckWalk> I'm not sure where a quadratic comes into that.
[16:04:54] <Sofia> To be more specific; I'm enumerating a few ideas towards subdivision and I have a strategy I believe to be optimal for ellipses and I want to score it, in terms of area removed per operation.
[16:05:42] <Sofia> I don't need this optimal method to be useful in practice; I only want it to show what optimal splits would be.
[16:05:43] <PlanckWalk> sin(x) cosh(y) + i cos(x) sinh(y) = cosh(4)  implies  sin(x) cosh(y) = cosh(4)  and cos(x) sinh(y) = 0

[16:32:18] <[itchyjunk]> all my calc classes are a big blurr :s
[16:34:05] <[itchyjunk]> okay so cos(iy) = cosh(y) checks out
[16:34:07] <PlanckWalk> Anyway, my solutions to the brute force quadratic are  e^(iz) = i e^4 and e^(iz) = i e^-4.
[16:34:26] <PlanckWalk> Which have pretty darn simple logarithms.
[16:34:31] <[itchyjunk]> how did you manage to work with those quadratics?
[16:34:39] <[itchyjunk]> are you working with e^(2iz) - e^(iz) ( i (e^4 - e^(-4)) - 1 = 0 ?
[16:34:47] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[16:34:51] <[itchyjunk]> ...
[16:34:58] <[itchyjunk]> guess i've gotton lazy
[16:35:05] <PlanckWalk> There's lots of simplications
[16:35:10] <PlanckWalk> simplifications*
[16:35:36] <PlanckWalk> Which are even easier if you just leave it as cosh(4)
[16:36:43] <[itchyjunk]> sin(iy) = -isinh(y)
[16:36:51] <[itchyjunk]> ?
[16:37:37] <PlanckWalk> e^(2iz) - e^(iz) (2i cosh(4)) - 1 = 0, yielding e^(iz) = i cosh(4) +/- sqrt(1 - cosh(4)^2) = i cosh(4) +/- i sinh(4) = i e^4 or i e^-4.
[16:37:40] <[itchyjunk]> oh it's not hmm

[16:39:42] <[itchyjunk]> Soemthing is wrong there :s
[16:40:12] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]:  it looks prettier when you see all the power series. For any complex z,  cos(z) = 1 - z^2/2! + z^4/4! - z^6/6! +...  and cosh(z) = 1 + z^2/2! + z^4/4! + z^6/6! +... : all the -'s became +'s, and since i^2 = -1, i^4 = 1, i^6 = -1, i^8 = 1,... that's why cosh(iz) = cos(z).  Very similar thing for the series for sin and sinh, but sinh(iz) ends up being i times the series for sin, since i^1 = i, i^3 = -i, i^5 = i, i^7 = -i,
[16:40:12] <Z-module> etc.
[16:40:23] <PlanckWalk> (e^-y - e^y) / (2i) = (-1/i) (e^y - e^-y)/2

[18:17:02] <[itchyjunk]> can f generally be decomposed into even and odd ?
[18:18:32] <Z-module> VEry easy fact: The vector space F of *all* (including discontinuous) functions R -> R has the direct sum splitting:  F = W (+) V  where W is all the even functions, V all the odd functions.
[18:18:41] <[-_-]> greenbagels: okay...so P_n(x) = sum a_j x^(s+j)
[18:18:52] <[-_-]> so s has two values, 1 or 0

[18:19:30] <[-_-]> so we have even odd parity
[18:19:34] <[-_-]> Am I right?
[18:19:44] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]:  For each f in F, just write  f(x) = (f(x) + f(-x))/2 + (f(x) - f(-x))/2   for that. Look familiar?
