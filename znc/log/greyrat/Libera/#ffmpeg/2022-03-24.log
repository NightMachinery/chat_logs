[05:48:24] <furq> there's a good reason why it's not recommended to use cbr or abr in pretty much any modern codec unless you have some dumb constraint

[20:36:59] <a1rwulf> In one of the answers this is stated: "Don't use cuvid, it is not better decoder in 2020. "
[20:36:59] <a1rwulf> And suggests usage of "-hwaccel nvdec".
[20:37:16] <a1rwulf> What's exactly the difference between those 2 hwaccels?

[20:46:57] <JEEB> a1rwulf: cuvid is a decoder and not hwaccel (which is complicated because you can get hwaccel cuvid as well, but it leads to the same underlying hwaccel :P ). the cuvid *decoders*  are a set of actuall full blown decoders as opposed to hwaccels which only handle slices. generally speaking it just means that more bit stream parsing is being done in the nvidia black box, which you generally don't want
[20:47:40] <JEEB> and the difference between hwaccel cuvid and nvdec with ffmpeg.c is just that the former defaults to hwaccel_output_format cuda since that's what the cuvid decoder apparently did?

[20:51:09] <a1rwulf> JEEB: Ok, I probably only understand half of it - but thanks for the detailed explanation
[20:51:52] <JEEB> basically I guess the quote you quoted meant the cuvid decoder, which yes - you should not utilize as opposed to hwaccels
[20:52:04] <JEEB> because generally leaving the bit stream parsing to the black box is a Bad Idea
[20:52:19] <JEEB> while hwaccels utilize the libavcodec parsers for the formats
[20:52:29] <a1rwulf> I see, that makes sense to me
[20:53:12] <JEEB> while for the cli tool it seems like you can call the hwaccel cuda, nvdec or cuvid, all of them have end up as "cuda"
[20:53:28] <JEEB> probably some sort of hysterical raisins
[20:53:48] <a1rwulf> I can successfully transcode using ffmpeg -hwaccel nvdec -hwaccel_output_format cuda -i udp://239.1.1.1:5000 -c:v h264_nvenc -preset llhp -vf 'hwupload,scale_npp=1920x1080" -c:a aac -ac 2 -f flv rtmp://localhost/live/test
[20:54:08] <JEEB> first thing I notice from that - prefer channel_layout to ac :)
[20:54:20] <a1rwulf> -channel_layout 2?
[20:54:21] <JEEB> -channel_layout stereo in your case
[20:54:28] <a1rwulf> ok, will try that
[20:54:42] <a1rwulf> is that using the new channel_layout API I've read about?

[20:55:29] <JEEB> a1rwulf: no, it just explicitly sets a layout :)
[20:55:33] <JEEB> which has a channel count
[20:55:44] <JEEB> but a channel count might not have an explicit channel layout
[20:55:48] <JEEB> like 4 being both 4.0 and 3.1
[20:56:02] <a1rwulf> makes sense
[20:56:11] <a1rwulf> the only thing that was not intuitive from first sight was, that I only needed the hwupload filter when the incoming stream was mpeg2 sd video
[20:57:38] <a1rwulf> as for the audio: I remove -ac 2 in favor of -channel_layout stereo, or do I need to use both?
[20:57:55] <a1rwulf> I assume stereo implies 2 channels though

[20:59:37] <a1rwulf> :)
[20:59:39] <JEEB> and my no regarding that new API is just because the option did work way before, we've had channel layouts for quite a long while as a thing in the API (and ffmpeg.c)
[20:59:53] <a1rwulf> ok
[20:59:57] <JEEB> it might underneath now utilize the new API, but it shouldn't change the capabilities

[21:01:17] <JEEB> a1rwulf: you should check the case where you needed hwupload, since the hwaccel if you set output format should follow that
[21:01:34] <JEEB> also you should prefer the cuda scale filter to NPP
[21:01:38] <JEEB> as it should now be on-par
[21:01:44] <JEEB> and actually redistributable
[21:02:18] <a1rwulf> ideally I wouldn't need to scale anyway, I just did use the scaler because it failed for SD video without scaling :)
[21:02:47] <a1rwulf> on the other hand, it might be handy to downscale 4k, cause I actually don't need it
[21:04:34] <a1rwulf> it's interesting how many tools you have to do all that stuff :D
[21:05:49] <a1rwulf> didn't even know about the cuda scale filter, I followed some guide on the nvidia website, but seems it's kinda outdated and it's not that straight forward to find out what the current best practise is.
[21:05:49] <a1rwulf> Unlike asking here ofc - which seems to work out pretty well :)
[21:06:35] <JEEB> I think NPP might have been added first, just based on the nvidia API. unfortunately it's not redistributable since it's a random closed source library. thus a CUDA scale filter was made. which is thus open source and compilable with clang
[21:07:11] <JEEB> NPP might get removed at some point since generally speaking all of the things possible with NPP are now possible with the open source cuda filters

[21:10:18] <JEEB> the cannot convert error is normal. I should add another message specifically from hw to non-hw or vice versa since it seems like the most common case for auto-scaler failing to be inserted :)

[22:02:57] <BtbN> something must be seriously messed up if the driver rejects your PTX code
[22:03:08] <BtbN> look at the .ptx files produced during build and check for obvious issues

[22:27:58] <a1rwulf> yeah maybe something docker specific - I'm using an nvidia enabled docker.
[22:27:58] <a1rwulf> maybe during ffmpeg build the driver capabilities haven't been correctly exposed or something.

[23:03:58] <a1rwulf> mhm ok
[23:04:59] <BtbN> What GPU are you using?
[23:05:31] <BtbN> If you use a recent enough Nvidia NVCC, it'll default to sm60, which will then not work on some older cards
[23:05:54] <a1rwulf> it's an older card
[23:05:54] <a1rwulf> Quadro M4000

[23:06:10] <BtbN> Which gen is that?
[23:06:24] <BtbN> Maxwell?
[23:06:28] <a1rwulf> think so
[23:06:56] <BtbN> GM204
[23:06:58] <BtbN> "GM204 supports CUDA Compute Capability 5.2"
[23:07:20] <ayaka> I am trying to extract a network stream(h.264 encoded hdmi extender), its udp payload always start with 0x24 0x07 or 0x24 0x05
[23:07:28] <BtbN> so yeah, if you build with an up to date nvcc, the minimum sm/compute capability it supports 6.0, so pty code it generate will not work on that old card.
[23:07:37] <BtbN> *ptx
[23:07:45] <a1rwulf> ok good to know
[23:07:50] <ayaka> is there way to figure out which protocol it is ?
[23:07:52] <BtbN> Just use clang really
[23:08:42] <BtbN> Or manually override the sm, it's in the nvccflags. The compiler will throw deprecation warnings if you set it to 5.2, but it should still work
[23:09:00] <a1rwulf> yeah I'll also verify if I can get a new card
