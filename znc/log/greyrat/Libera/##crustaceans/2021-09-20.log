[01:13:41] <manicennui> I'm watching this one where a person is walking downtown, and no one seems to be looking at them.
[01:14:09] <manicennui> They clearly aren't holding a phone in their hand or something either.
[01:14:24] <manicennui> Phone in a shirt pocket with the camera above the pocket might work.

[18:45:17] <Brekkjern> AKMs do pretty much the same thing as an AR15
[18:45:21] <kline> i understood weapons ownership (legal or otherwise) to be relatively common in russia
[18:45:31] <dimadima> i'm not aware of those being legal to own in russia
[18:45:40] <kline> neither are school shootings, generally
[18:45:43] <dimadima> i don't think you can even own handguns in russia
[18:45:51] <dimadima> just rifles
[18:45:52] <Brekkjern> It's not legal, no
[18:46:49] <kline> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_Russia

[18:46:56] <dimadima> there we go kline! thank you :)
[18:47:32] <Brekkjern> >As of 2013 Russian citizens over 18 years of age can obtain a firearms license after attending gun-safety classes and passing a federal test and background check. Firearms may be acquired for self-defense, hunting, or sports activities, as well as for collection purposes. Carrying permits may be issued for hunting firearms licensed for hunting purposes.
[18:47:57] <kline> russia is <50% the size of the US - so be sure to account for this, along with probably media underreporting, when comparing US/RU lists of mass shootings
[18:48:33] <dimadima> the word "School" only appears three times on that page
[18:49:48] <dimadima> but wait lets be explicit: are you guys saying russia has a comprable level of school shoots to the USA?
[18:50:06] <dimadima> we have soooo many here
[18:50:14] <Brekkjern> No, we are not.

[18:50:25] <buttsbot> List of school shootings in the United States - Wikipedia
[18:50:27] <Brekkjern> I don't really know why we are talking about this to be honest
[18:50:36] <dimadima> hehe
[18:50:48] <dimadima> cause there was one in perm apparently
[18:50:52] <Brekkjern> Yes
[18:50:55] <dimadima> but yeah stupid topic i'm down to not talk about it
[18:51:00] <Brekkjern> But we were talking about likely perpetrators
[18:51:08] <dimadima> incels for sure
[18:51:18] <Brekkjern> In this case it is likely, yes
[18:51:28] <kline> dimadima, mind a lot of these entries wont exist in the russia article, which is specifically for "mass" shootings. you need to remove from the US list all the shootings under some threshold to get a comparable list
[18:51:42] <kline> then account for population difference, media reporting, etc
[18:51:49] <ngoldbaum> russia not above staging an attack to distract from bad political news
[18:52:33] <Brekkjern> Russian news might also hush down a lot of stuff and since it's in Russian, it's not likely to spread as easily outside the Russiosphere (that's a thing right? The Russiosphere? :P)
[18:52:40] <kline> ngoldbaum, its good news today, mind, putin's party wins a great election result
[18:52:53] <ngoldbaum> with massively fraudulent results
[18:53:04] <kline> doesnt matter; established govt
[18:53:13] <kline> whos going to hold them on it?
[18:53:42] <Brekkjern> It might be to distract from the way they won the election though
[18:54:04] <Brekkjern> But honestly, I think it's just a dipshit being a dipshit.
[18:56:29] <gerikson> me too
[18:57:01] <gerikson> this is the sort of public safety issue that voters will and should hold the government accountable for

[20:20:35] <ngoldbaum> indigo: monomorphization is expensive, anything that makes heavy use of generics will need a ton of RAM
[20:22:12] <ngoldbaum> serde in particular is responsible for a lot of stuff like this
[20:22:53] <Brekkjern> gerikson: It has been concluded: https://i.redd.it/lxbxx5ejcko71.jpg
[20:25:46] <indigo> I guess it's time to find a popular language that has no generics

[20:26:06] <indigo> And that can do concurrency decently well
[20:27:15] <indigo> Brekkjern: FUCKING SWEDEN
[20:27:23] <Brekkjern> Yes
[20:30:10] <indigo> I was just talking to my wife that Norway is one of the happiest countries in the world (according to the World Happiness Report)
[20:30:53] <indigo> She expressed interest in moving there, but I told her she'd need to try brunost and lutefisk first before she makes her decision ;)
[20:31:30] <Brekkjern> The only thing that drops us down on the happyness index is that we are neighbours to Sweden. That will ruin your ranking on any list ;)

[20:51:52] <dimadima> it seems like automated tooling gives itself away often enough by using HTTP/1.1

[21:32:40] <gerikson> 14:51 <DiffieHellman> While systemd is free software, a few red flags are that it's developed on github and the head dev calls it "open source".

[21:34:39] <gerikson> one time Lennart was rude on the internet, his software is dead to me
[21:36:19] <dimadima> i didn't know "open source" was a dog wistle
[21:36:45] <gerikson> depends on where you hang out dimadima
[21:36:54] <gerikson> this quote is from #fsf

[21:38:26] <dimadima> not to sound like i don't want them to be
[21:39:23] <gerikson> I think it's a passing of the guard
[21:39:25] <dimadima> isn't linux moving/moved to github?
[21:39:43] <dimadima> gerikson: in what sense
[21:39:45] <gerikson> systemd means that the first generation Linux enthusiasts have "lost control"
[21:39:59] <gerikson> and the development is now in the hands of "pros" and BigCos
[21:40:16] <gerikson> systemd is just the symptom
[21:40:32] <gerikson> also FSF peeps desperately fighting a rearguard action
[21:40:40] <dimadima> to which the answer is always there are like 3-4 other major init packages you can use
[21:40:56] <gerikson> and trying to avoid the cognitive dissonance of people accepting their ideas but rejecting the movement
[21:41:00] <dimadima> but systemd is the default now so... linux is forever lost?
[21:41:06] <gerikson> apparently
[21:41:13] <dimadima> linux has been corporate forever now
[21:41:26] <gerikson> yeah
[21:41:30] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: IBM will be able to monetize enterprise support contracts forever anyway
[21:41:47] <gerikson> maybe it's before the old geeks said "jump", and now no-one listens (or jumps)?
[21:42:21] <gerikson> yeah they can charge for support, but the development is handled by someone else
[21:42:42] <dimadima> did i make up that linux is on or will be on github too?

[21:48:30] <dimadima> A recent post to the kernel workflows mailing list shows some progress toward a bot that can turn a GitHub pull request (PR) into a well-formed patch series to send to the proper reviewers and mailing lists.
[21:48:56] <dimadima> i hope they do. as much i personally like github, i do also personally think important projects should always be weary of it and resist it
[21:49:47] <dimadima>  He is also considering having his bot pick up patches from the mailing list and turning them into GitHub PRs‚Äîthe reverse of what Ryabitsev is doing.
[21:50:05] <riv> sounds like a waste of energy
[21:50:21] <dimadima> yes
[21:50:40] <dimadima> anyway, #fsf should be aware that linux itself is being compromised
[21:51:20] <indigo> Good! I don't understand why we can't support workflows that are convenient for others
[21:51:50] <dimadima> i think because convenience is antithetical to freedom in many cases
[21:52:05] <ngoldbaum> maybe the fsf should have taken the kernel developers‚Äô feedback about gplv3 15 years ago if they cared at all about linux
[21:52:24] * ngoldbaum wonders what a universe where gplv3 never happened looks like
[21:52:45] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: i don't know anything about that, sadly

[22:55:53] <indigo> At my last company we used to block by UA as well
[22:57:34] <Brekkjern> It's probably one of those things where it's super easy to get around, but it's also super easy to block by

[23:02:47] <dimadima> Brekkjern: what index is there to "fall off" of? FB isn't a search engine?
[23:03:11] <indigo> dimadima: Yeah, link previews
[23:03:39] <Brekkjern> ^
[23:03:55] <dimadima> gwozniak: that's crazy
[23:04:26] <dimadima> cool thanks ppl
[23:04:31] <dimadima> i've been wondering why it comes
[23:04:55] <indigo> dimadima: Does it still come in huge waves
[23:05:16] <indigo> Like nothing for a while, and then "oh my God my server is melting"
[23:05:52] <dimadima> indigo: naa not for me just this every so often: https://gist.github.com/dminkovsky/30400c7c5aa7644aec52d61f0340e619

[23:06:18] <indigo> Aww yeah PHP baby
[23:06:57] <dimadima> go to love `index.php`s etc
[23:07:11] <dimadima> i went to parler.com the other day to see if it still exists and it was index.php lol
[23:07:30] <dimadima> no wait, looks like main.php, my bad
[23:08:18] <dimadima> my site has nothing to index though so maybe that's related
[23:18:15] <manicennui> I need a scheme to take wealth from the present, and physically move it to the past, so I can invest it and create more wealth in the present.
[23:18:19] <manicennui> After I build my time machine of course.
[23:18:23] <manicennui> The best I can come up with is gold.
[23:18:40] <manicennui> But I think people would become suspicious in the past if I keep having more gold.
[23:19:17] <manicennui> And I would probably want to go back to maybe the late 20th century to invest in stocks.
[23:19:35] <dimadima> are you writing a book
[23:19:39] <manicennui> No.
[23:19:44] <manicennui> I just think about dumb shit.
[23:20:09] <dimadima> there's a stack exchange for that: https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/

[23:20:31] <manicennui> I have considered whether I should try my hand at writing.
[23:20:45] <manicennui> For a long time I thought, "If you are going to be a writer, you would already be writing."
[23:21:04] <manicennui> Then I found a great comment somewhere pointing out that it is not writing that is key, it is storytelling.
[23:21:14] <manicennui> And many of us tell stories, just not in writing.
[23:29:23] * manicennui finally signs up for Curiosity Stream/Nebula/SOMM/Topic.
[23:29:40] <manicennui> $57 for a year is pretty decent.
[23:41:08] <prussian> what is that.
[23:41:24] <prussian> oh, I see.
[23:42:09] <manicennui> If you are considering it and want a discount: http://CuriosityStream.com/citybeautiful

[23:42:18] <manicennui> The SD subscription is even cheaper.
[23:42:52] <manicennui> Actually I guess it is HD and 4k.
[23:42:55] <manicennui> HD is $15 per year.
[23:43:16] <prussian> looks like they are showing different rates to different users.
[23:43:17] <manicennui> I've been directed to curiositystream and nebula a few times in the last 6 months now. Finally decided to give in.
[23:43:23] <prussian> it shows as 19.99 here lol
[23:43:35] <prussian> oh, ok, now I see the 'price cut'
[23:43:37] <prussian> wtf...
[23:44:00] <prussian> evil real time analytics demons...
[23:44:18] <manicennui> Some YTers seem to be putting some exclusive content on curiosity steam.
[23:44:31] <manicennui> I support efforts to decentralize such content.
[23:44:40] <manicennui> And it seems like Vimeo is basically done at this point.
[23:45:22] <manicennui> Vimeo has been trying to charge users to host popular videos.
[23:45:51] <manicennui> The people who did the Robocop crotch shot parody got asked for like $10k per year to continue to host their video.
[23:47:49] <prussian> wut...
[23:48:02] <prussian> clearly you say, "ya no"
[23:49:25] <manicennui> They seem to think this is how they will survive.
[23:49:29] <manicennui> I think it will be their end.
[23:49:50] <manicennui> Free video hosting has become the standard, good or bad.
[23:50:16] <manicennui> Perhaps with enough content something like curiosity stream could be created for short films.
[23:50:30] <manicennui> Really low monthly fee for access.
[23:53:59] <manicennui> This is really awesome: https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/crowds-flock-champs-elysees-during-paris-car-free-day-2021-09-19/?utm_source=reddit.com

[23:54:47] <manicennui> "The Socialist mayor, a candidate in next year's presidential election, has also reduced the speed limit on most of the city's streets to 30 kilometres per hour (19 miles per hour) from 50 kph and pedestrianised some busy roads along the river Seine."
[23:54:59] <manicennui> "But her policies have irritated motorists, particularly some residents of the suburbs who complain they do not have adequate alternative forms of transport."
[23:55:01] <manicennui> Boo hoo.
[23:55:48] <manicennui> Relevant to a recent discussion here, apparently Portland has drastically cut the maximum allowable house size to 2500 square feet.
[23:56:03] <manicennui> Which basically kills any possibility of McMansions.
[23:56:20] <edk> in fairness suburbs present a real problem for non-car-users and it's not the fault of the people who live in them
[23:56:27] <edk> they're a failure of urban planning
[23:56:32] <manicennui> It kind of is.
[23:56:41] <manicennui> Suburbanites push for more and more roads and parking.
[23:56:59] <manicennui> And they become upset when cities that are far better than the ones they live in don't cater to them.
[23:57:21] <manicennui> I get that public transportation probably needs to be expanded at the same time, but suburbanites are definitely part of the problem.
[23:58:10] <manicennui> In Chicago we have a decent commuter rail system to get suburbanites to downtown to work, and I'm fine with just forgetting about them other than that.
[23:58:16] <manicennui> Chicago forgetting about them that is.
[23:58:28] <manicennui> Their bad city design isn't Chicago's problem.
[23:58:35] <manicennui> The country/state on the other hand...
