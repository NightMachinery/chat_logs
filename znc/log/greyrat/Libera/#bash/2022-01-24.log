[02:19:14] <kurahaupo1> Tabmow: total*4/5 will work just fine with integer arithmetic

[02:20:41] <Blondie101010> 80% of an int is not guaranteed to be an int
[02:20:42] <kurahaupo1> That will be rounded towards zero. If you need it rounded in a different direction, add an offset between the multiplication and the division.

[02:25:22] <Earnestly> They're doing cat | grep | grep.  This resolves to awk, and awk has float
[02:25:30] <kurahaupo1> Tabmow: since you're calculating a portion of total RAM, and that's a power of 2, you can be certain that 80% isn't an integer unless you have some weird asymmetric RAM hardware
[02:25:33] <Dan39> i think i did pre-calc... so i never got into the fun/hard calculus stuff :(
[02:25:50] <Dan39> Earnestly: good idea
[02:26:55] <kurahaupo1> Dan39: normalizing fractions is taught in grade school
[02:27:02] <Tabmow> kurahaupo1: yeah, I'm not too worries about that though, rounded up or down to the nearest int is fine. As long as I always get an int as that is what the jvm option expects.

[02:28:30] <kurahaupo1> Earnestly: I took it as read that it would need an integer result, because a fractional bit isn't useful

[02:29:33] <Earnestly> kurahaupo1: As you know, that'd be printf in awk.  My point being more that the solution here is going to involve awk regardless so integer arith doesn't matter
[02:29:43] <Blondie101010> 80% and the 100 multiplier
[02:29:56] <kurahaupo1> Blondie101010: why 100 multiplier?

[02:33:19] <Blondie101010> sure, less obvious to my taste, but mathematically correct
[02:33:43] <kurahaupo1> Blondie101010: integer arithmetic has a bit limit. Throwing in excessively large multipliers increases the chances that an intermediate result will exceed INTMAX
[02:33:54] <Blondie101010> of course

[03:39:51] <Celmor[m]> damn, why can't I open that link in my browser without having to download it
[03:40:34] <Earnestly> Usually because it prioritises "file extensions" over mimetypes, which is text/x-shellscript

[13:41:07] <rendar> geirha, i specified in very *old* bash versions on purpose, when /bin/[ was used instead of the built-in
[13:41:10] <geirha> that's bash 1.14.7 from 1994-ish
[13:41:27] <geirha> pretty sure [ has been a builtin since the very beginning
[13:41:34] <rendar> well, at some point back in time /bin/[ was used
[13:41:41] <rendar> i'm referring that
[13:42:30] <rendar> when bash was using /bin/[ instead of the builtin, if [ a ] || [ b ] ... where separate processes, i guess
[13:42:43] <geirha> perhaps ancient versions of bourne shell didn't have [ builtin, but that would be way before bash came about
[13:42:52] <rendar> i see
[13:43:14] <rendar> now the question is, if [ is a builtin, and /bin/[ is not used since decades, literally, why [[ has been introduced?
[13:43:29] <uuidNuni1> yeah external command runs in a new process?
[13:43:48] <uuidNuni1> rendar:->  [ is limited in functionality
[13:44:02] <geirha> [[ is a keyword which allows more functionality, including pattern matching and regex matching
[13:44:09] <rendar> i see
[13:44:36] <uuidNuni1> rendar:->  if you want to know what [ can do , man dash
[13:44:44] <rendar> ok
[13:44:59] <geirha> /bin/test and /bin/[ exists mainly to allow using the command outside a shell
[13:45:01] <uuidNuni1> dash is posix ... while [[ in bash is not posix
[13:45:37] <geirha> well, bash is also posix
[13:45:54] <geirha> if you want to know what posix defines for the test command, install the posix manpages, and run  man 1p test

[17:45:13] <eoli3n> i'm trying to debug some black magic
[17:45:27] *** Joins: libc (~weechat@user/tessio)
[17:46:02] <eoli3n> at the end of a preseeded ubuntu install, i run "success_command" to run a script in a chroot
[17:46:31] <eoli3n> ubiquity ubiquity/success_command string chroot /target bash /tmp/post.sh;
[17:46:48] <eoli3n>  /tmp/post.sh keeps runing with sh
[17:46:59] <eoli3n> i can see this by printing $0
[17:47:11] <eoli3n> any which can trigger this ?
[17:47:30] <eoli3n> i tried to chmod 755 the script and run it directly (relying on shebang) but same
[17:47:57] <eoli3n> if I run the line manually "chroot /target bash /tmp/post.sh" it runs well with bash
[17:48:36] <eoli3n> any+"idea"
[17:48:53] <geirha> best guess is that /tmp/post.sh got generated some place along the way, and the $0 got replaced with sh already at that point
[17:48:54] <Soliton> read the documentation of that ubiquity thing?
[17:49:30] <geirha> e.g. by doing cat << EOF > post.sh  instead of   cat << 'EOF' > post.sh
[17:49:38] <eoli3n> geirha i know that sh run the thing because i get error on tests [[
[17:50:04] <geirha> ok, weird
[17:50:33] <eoli3n> Soliton that's ubuntu, there is no documentation about this, so more that "use success_command" with an exemple
[17:50:57] <eoli3n> s/so/no
[17:51:11] <Earnestly> Is success_command open sauce?
[17:51:17] <Masklin_Gurder> *source
[17:51:19] <Earnestly> Is it binary file?
[17:51:34] <Earnestly> Masklin_Gurder: *sores
[17:51:59] <eoli3n> Earnestly yep, from https://code.launchpad.net/ubiquity
[17:52:06] <eoli3n> lets grep -ri this
[17:52:53] <eoli3n> Earnestly i can't tell if that's a script or a binary file
[17:53:04] <Earnestly> eoli3n: What does file call it?
[17:53:56] <eoli3n> i can't tell, that's internal installer mecanics, i just add the line i pasted in a preseed file, i give the http url to the file in a kernel installer var
[17:54:20] <Earnestly> You don't have access to this 'success_command' file?
[17:54:48] <eoli3n> this ? "ubiquity/success_command"
[17:55:01] <eoli3n> probably from source yes, on somewhere in the installer os, i need to search for it
[17:55:08] <eoli3n> s/on/or
[17:55:34] <Earnestly> It's not part of this repo, it looks like a file it executes, and it uses:             execute_root('sh', '-c', self.success_cmd)
[17:56:00] <Earnestly> So you provide it, and it runs it if exists.  But this is how it executes it, with sh -c
[17:56:45] <Earnestly> (here self.success_command is 'ub.../success_command'
[17:56:58] <geirha> but that means it runs   sh -c 'chroot /target bash /tmp/post.sh;'  which should run /tmp/post.sh with bash inside the chroot
