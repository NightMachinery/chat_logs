[00:49:26] <teresko> well, at least it is 5.2.4+ ... I think that's the version when code zero-byte code injection was fixed in string functions

[00:55:46] <__adrian> good practice  :)
[00:56:04] <akk> (And it's true I'm not a PHP expert ... I use other languages more, and just know enough PHP to be dangerous :)
[00:56:25] <__adrian> and yes, that did come off as condescending :(  it is worth a word of caution, though.
[00:56:50] <teresko> you will also need to know how to upgrade the webserver (since I don't thijnk they will spring for hiring a sysadmin)
[00:58:06] <Sammitch> honestly just spin up a fresh VM and migrate the app. I would wager that anything that has 5.2 installed on it is WAY into EOL and has no repos or upgrade path anymore.
[00:58:21] <teresko> so, my advice is: unless you are going to get well paid for this (or are desperate for CV entries), I would avoid taking up that project - it will be very painful and thankless task
[00:58:59] <Sammitch> or if you are willing to donate your time in exchange for charitable tax deductions :P
[00:59:59] <akk> It's weird how web hosting services seem to prefer not to upgrade anything ever.
[00:59:59] <akk> I suppose if they kept everything updated, customers would always be complaining when things broke.
[01:00:05] <lembron> well, that took some bruteforcing, but i seem to have gotten somethign that at leats kinda works ;)  i still get "Access to an undefined property ChargeBee\ChargeBee\Models\Customer::$illegalField" (as i should) --- but $validField now works just fine, by parsing from the protected $allowed property in the class :D

[04:29:22] <Albright> skyfall: Perhaps do some logging to confirm that your cache hits are actually hits. It might be that it's always missing and falling back to the DB.
[04:30:31] <Albright> That said, the SQL query you have really isn't that complex, so I wouldn't expect Memcached to really be all that much faster than MySQL in that particular case.
[04:33:11] <Albright> Also, I'd just store $row as a single value in memcache so you only have to do one fetch and there's no chance of the values getting out of synch with each other. Like `$mem->set('img_'.$id, $row);` but I guess that'd be up to you.

[04:34:56] <Albright> And just in general storing images in a database is usually frowned upon; it's faster to just have them on disk so you can use readfile() which is *very* fast - it basically sends data directly from the disk to your server's network card, not passing through the CPU or RAM or any processes (like PHP or a database daemon).

[04:38:02] <skyfall> Albright: Ah, I see. I wasn't aware that we can store associate arrays like that in memcached.

[04:39:37] <Albright> l__q: Just a guess though, are there no rows with an id value less than whatever you have bound into :id ? If that value is already the lowest one in the table, you won't get a row
[04:40:02] <Blondie101010> yeah, weird statement :/
[04:40:16] <skyfall> Albright: I usually find it cumbersome to have images on disk, like I'll have to move around, permissions, bla bla bla; and 90% of persistent goes to DB anyway, so I store images on DB as LONGBLOB so that I'll just access it easily. (since I don't have any other media files like mp3 or mp4).
[04:40:23] <l__q> Albright: no, it should works, with prisma and postgress it works fine

[04:41:03] <__adrian> skyfall: generally, the benefits of storing images in the db don't include _serving_ them from the db.

[04:53:08] <Blondie101010> yep
[04:53:16] <Sammitch> but again, bucket. want faster? turn on a CDN.
[04:53:27] *** Joins: Awaru (Awaru@gateway/vpn/airvpn/awaru)
[04:53:33] <skyfall> My intention of using memcached is saving CPU cycles, since I thought querying DB, and doing all those stuff would be slower than getting it from a cache and serving it.
[04:53:40] <l__q> stupid question, can I use PHP on my gemini website? gemini://tilde.team/~grizzly/
[04:53:55] <Blondie101010> that's why I mentioned scalability
[04:54:21] <l__q> CGI works, also mayby PHP too?
[04:54:28] <skyfall> But memcached would resolve those ton of DB right? isn't it what it's doing?
[04:54:33] <skyfall> if there's a cache hit.
[04:54:33] <Albright> l__q: Probably a question for yoru host.
[04:54:38] <l__q> ok
[04:54:45] <l__q> sorry
[04:54:48] <Sammitch> skyfall: when you read a file, the OS reads the file into FS cache and feeds it to the application from there. if the file is frequently accessed and the OS does not demand that cache space back, then it stays in that cache
[04:55:05] <Blondie101010> l__q:  php is simply a programming language, which you can definitely use to output something other than HTML
[04:55:11] <Sammitch> something like memcached is best used to cache dynamically-generated application data
[04:55:20] <l__q> Blondie101010: thanks
[04:55:26] <Blondie101010> np
[04:55:39] <Albright> l__q: BTW, if you have an interest in Gemini, mind having a look at https://github.com/GarrettAlbright/KyuWeb and letting me know what you think? I'm currently in the process of writing a test server (in PHP).
[04:55:42] <Sammitch> if you wanted dedicated caching for static assets, then you're looking for a CDN or equivalent caching proxy
[04:56:14] <Blondie101010> and they won't be able to pull images from your memcached
[04:56:15] <l__q> Albright: wow, this is great! big thank you!
[04:56:27] <__adrian> let's clarify
[04:56:28] <__adrian> advantages of storing images in the db: *consolidates lifecycle management (e.g., deletes along with row) *transaction isolation *can rollback *consistent and cohesive backups *easier access control
[04:56:37] <__adrian> *nothing at all* to do with performance.
[04:56:55] <skyfall> Sammitch: hmm, i see. but in that case i'll be serving images from FS.
[04:57:02] <__adrian> for performance, you regularly cache those images on disk.
[04:57:30] <Blondie101010> skyfall:  the OS knows how to cache efficiently
[04:57:50] <__adrian> ^
[04:58:42] <skyfall> __adrian: my intention of using DB, like i said previously, is for convenience. and convenience only, to move around quickly, easily without too much care. and i'm trying to solve the performance issue with memcached (since i know querying DB is slower than serving it as a static from from FS).
[04:58:55] <__adrian> "move around" ?
[04:59:12] <skyfall> to make myself clear, i do understand serving static images from FS is the fastest method.
[04:59:35] <Blondie101010> there may be a need for a DB and/or memcached with the FS solution, for meta data
[04:59:35] <skyfall> __adrian: yeah, to move the images (databases in this case) around servers during migration.
[04:59:47] <__adrian> ...how often does that happen
[04:59:54] <Blondie101010> skyfall:  not easier or faster to do in a DB
[05:00:27] <__adrian> also: think more about "repeatable deployment" than "migrating servers"
[05:01:22] <Sammitch> if you're shifting applications around I would count that as another point for putting static files in an object store
[05:01:30] <__adrian> ^
[05:01:31] <skyfall> well, it's every few month. i store everything in my DB, encryption keys, images, user data, info, bla bla bla so that there's only one place to perform migration. mysqldump > backup.sql && scp backup.sql root@new_server.com:/root/backup.sql
[05:02:22] <Sammitch> also mysql dump and import workflow is not terribly reliable when you've got binary data in the mix
[05:03:22] <__adrian> seems oddly frequent in one sense and infrequent in another
[05:03:36] <__adrian> but like i said, think in terms of "reproducible deployments."
[05:03:42] <Sammitch> ^
[05:03:52] <Sammitch> something something ansible
[05:04:04] <__adrian> i.e., the "old server" should not be involved in standing up the new server.
[05:04:17] <__adrian> maybe at the end you'll have a minor sync.
[05:04:35] <skyfall> my DNS point to a central long-term reverse proxy to proxy requests to ephemeral backend servers.
[05:05:20] <skyfall> i shred the old server and reconfigure the backend on the reverse proxy and it's up and running.
[05:05:40] <Sammitch> I am now _wildly_ suspicious of what kind of service you're running
[05:05:44] <__adrian> what's the need to move servers like this?
[05:05:55] *** Quits: fef (~thedawn@user/thedawn) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[05:06:47] <skyfall> well, let's just say i move around the backend application servers with embedded MySQL database.
[05:06:49] <__adrian> > girls_image_db
[05:07:37] <__adrian> best case i can think of is an adult site, but doesn't want to pay for hosting that allows adult sites.
[05:07:53] <__adrian> buit that's neither here nor there. i think we've had a full discussion.
[05:07:57] <__adrian> *but
[05:08:47] <skyfall> well, like i said, it's served through reverse proxy, so i really don't worry about backend service provider's ToS on adult content.
[05:08:56] <skyfall> (it's not an adult site)
[05:09:34] <Blondie101010> their TOS stand even if they don't notice it
[05:09:42] <skyfall> since front end server's ToS is pretty solid
[05:10:04] <__adrian> regardless
[05:10:15] <__adrian> we've addressed the relevant questions, at this point

[12:51:18] <jenntech> ok that got rid of one of the errors on console but still not printing anything
[12:51:58] <ash_worksi> assuming you're not just refreshing that redirect
[12:52:15] <ash_worksi> you're not just hitting refresh on your page are you?
[12:53:26] <jenntech> ok so in connection.php should the $sessionlocation be just the localhost ip address or the whole link with the db name?
[12:53:37] <jenntech> ummm.. ya
[12:53:38] <jenntech> lol
[12:54:00] <jenntech> restart the server?
[12:54:46] <ash_worksi> if you're just refreshing the page, you'll always get that error because that's a static error page
[12:54:55] <jenntech> oh hahaha
[12:54:55] <ash_worksi> (well, not really, but it's "the" error page)
[12:54:58] <jenntech> i knew that lol
[12:55:11] <jenntech> one sec

[12:58:50] <jenntech> ok so i restarted the server and reclicked the link.. same thing
[13:00:22] <ash_worksi> what is the href on the link you click?
[13:01:09] <jenntech> http://<my localhost address>:90/wx4_build_373/
[13:04:29] <ash_worksi> okay, visit that from now on when you check your output; (A) to diagnose this problem very slowly, I would check your webserver logs to see what script is actually being called to start this off (B) just based off the script you showed me, you could try actually running these queries manually on whatever database this is setup to access

[13:06:06] <ash_worksi> (C) it might be worthwhile to setup xdebug in your environment and step through your process, but if you don't know how that's supposed to work it may be non-trivial for you
[13:06:25] *** Joins: CNCFR06__ (~sinvet@user/sinvet)
[13:06:28] <ash_worksi> the quickest option is (B)
[13:06:42] <jenntech> ok
[13:06:59] <jenntech> that would be done from phpmyadmin? or xampp control panel?
[13:07:02] <ash_worksi> my next guess would be that your session handler is not set correctly in php.ini
[13:07:12] <jenntech> ok
[13:07:50] <ash_worksi> personally I would login to the database instance... I haven't used xampp in a really long time, but I think it orchestrates vms on VirtualBox iirc
[13:07:58] <jenntech> ok
[13:08:20] <ash_worksi> so I would just open VirtualBox, click on the database server instance and login
[13:09:24] <ash_worksi> (it would spawn a terminal where you could run the `mysql` command... or whatever client mysql uses, I don't personally remember)

[13:30:46] <velix> Since php files shouldn't be in webroot directory, what's a good naming scheme for web projects? /var/www/example.org/{php,public}? So php stuff goes into php and all HTML & CSS stuff goes into public?
[13:32:31] <teresko> velix: /public , /src ,
[13:32:45] <teresko> where public is the doc_root
[13:34:57] <velix> teresko: yeah, but I also have python stuff. So /src/{php,python}?
[13:35:09] <velix> teresko: but "src" always sounds like "needs to be compiled".
[13:35:16] <velix> teresko: isn't it like /app ?
[13:35:19] <ash_worksi> velix: if you're trying to be FHS, consider /srv/{example}/app
[13:35:37] <ash_worksi> actually
[13:35:40] <velix> ash_worksi: That's a mess for permissions. I like to have it at one point :D
[13:35:45] <teresko> velix: maybe you should stick with one backend language
[13:35:54] <velix> teresko: Impossible with 3 underpaid people.
[13:35:59] <velix> teresko: don't ask.
[13:36:00] <velix> please.
[13:36:11] <ash_worksi> 03:05 <@ngxbot> Standard filesystem structure: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard -- web roots/files go in /var/www or /srv/{www,http,web} or /srv/web/$domain.tld/{,htdocs,www}/ etc. Package managers manage most of /usr, so you should not edit files there. /home dirs usually have restrictive permissions and are a bad idea.
[13:36:22] <teresko> I woun't as it is it already sounds very retarded
[13:36:24] <velix> ash_worksi: Debian doesn't follow FHS ;)
[13:36:33] <velix> teresko: indeed.
[13:36:53] <velix> oh, what's the difference between www,http and web? :D
[13:36:59] <ash_worksi> velix: nothing
[13:37:06] <ash_worksi> those are all just suggestions
[13:37:22] <ash_worksi> (for the same thing)
[13:37:23] <velix> ash_worksi: actually, Debian default config links /srv/web/ to /var/www
[13:37:28] <velix> All the packages are linked to this point.
[13:37:36] <velix> So it's not following FHS here.
[13:37:43] <velix> Other distributions follow this, I know.
[13:37:45] <velix> Fedora does
[13:37:51] <teresko> welll ... for a project that had ES6+ and PHP  I used /src/Application/Client  (of containing JS code) and /src/Application/API  (for PHP)
[13:38:19] <ash_worksi> sounds reasonable to me
[13:38:50] <velix> teresko: yeah, but I have backend workers, which need to use python, since PHP doesn't have bindings or libs here ;)
[13:38:58] <velix> I might place those in /srv/ or /opt/

[13:39:16] <ash_worksi> velix: I put everything in /srv personally
[13:39:17] <teresko> you really need two separate projects
[13:39:32] <velix> ash_worksi: hrhr, don't tell the Borg queen.
[13:39:46] <ash_worksi> and the workers could be their own projects really
[13:39:58] <velix> teresko: We need more money, then we can split them ;)
[13:40:02] <ash_worksi> if you're using a queue you don't even need them running to test your code
[13:40:20] <teresko> velix: what money do you need for creating a separate git repo

[13:40:56] <ash_worksi> I have no experience with beanstalkd

[13:42:12] <velix> teresko: What amount are we talking of? 3M a second or 1k a day?
[13:42:12] <teresko> also, the queues in beanstalk have hardcoded "shutdown limit"

[14:33:25] <Naktibalda> composer show --format=json  returns much smaller and easier to process json

[19:22:58] <dag> microtime() still good for measuring stuff. i see there's a newer hrtime()
[19:23:49] <AllenJB> Depends on what resolution / accuracy you need. For the vast majority of cases microtime() is fine
[19:26:21] <ordos> dag, assuming you're measuring stuff on the same server (same timezone) then yeah it's fine, but across different servers just be wary

[19:34:21] <ordos> the more I think about it dag I think just use hrtime

[19:34:59] <ordos> aside from microtime's system clock risk alluded to above there also seems to be some comp overhead when using it on VMs which I wasn't aware of
[19:35:34] <ordos> hrtime is higher resolution yes but that doesn't mean you shouldn't use it - it's built specifically for stopwatch scenarios, may as well leverage it

[19:44:49] <dag> is it possible to stop execution of a function after n seconds? e.g. function() {while(true);}
[19:46:03] <ordos> dag, something like this? https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.set-time-limit.php
[19:46:38] <dag> nah i still want to continue execution.
[19:46:53] * ordos scratches his head
[19:47:03] <Naktibalda> dag: no, you have to implement some checks in the function
[19:47:39] <dag> one example case could be a third party library that is running way too long
[19:47:49] <ordos> php has default maximums in place

[19:49:45] <Knowsin> https://kopy.io/RVzsy my problem is that if $cats is array then it will only print one $inner_query and I'm not sure why
[19:50:32] <Naktibalda> KnownSyntax: change += to []=
[19:50:47] <teresko> dag: what is the problem that you are actually trying to solve?
[19:50:48] <Naktibalda> += overwrites fields on each iteration.
[19:50:58] <teresko> I mean, why do you need to stop that function
[19:51:08] <KnownSyntax> Naktibalda: bad tab fyi
[19:52:03] <teresko> KnownSyntax: and now you made me search for Bloodhound Gang - The Bad Touch :(
[19:52:08] <dag> teresko: im processing some data and if some part is taking too long i want to skip to the next item in the agenda
[19:52:53] <ordos> dag, by skip to you mean stop and move on to the next? Or do you mean keep doing it in the background and move on to the next?
[19:53:11] <dag> just skip it
[19:53:11] <teresko> dag: sound like you should instead look at doing that processing in background as either backgrounbd service waiting on message queue or as a cron job
[19:53:27] <ordos> ^ that
[19:53:29] <dag> alright thanks
[19:53:42] <ordos> or alternatively you can buffer output and keep processing in background but that's highly niche
[19:54:00] <da_wunder> imho - that sounds like you should use message queuee
[19:54:23] <da_wunder> with that you could use `n` workers to process each single item
[19:55:02] <ordos> teresko, Bad Touch, hah, memories
