[20:32:36] <waleee> aartaka made removed the build of the web-extensions lib from nyxt.asd because of recurrent other build issues
[20:33:51] <waleee> so now I think you have to build it seperately  with the makefile inside libraries/web-extensions or use the toplevel makefile
[20:33:52] <Fade> I was building with the makefile.
[20:33:56] <waleee> ah

[21:50:41] <aartaka> ardon: symbol definitions are compiled away due to how we build Nyxt binaries. I am irritated by this too, but I use source-based RELP just too often, so I don't notice the irritation of compiled images symbol stripping.
[21:52:27] <aartaka> ardon: It is interesting is that StumpWM is compiled in a similar way by Guix, while all its symbols are accessible from the REPL. I believe we can learn from StumpWM in this regard.
[22:10:35] <opalvaults[m]> Who wrote the password manager integration aartaka ?
[22:12:36] <aartaka> opalvaults[m]: It was initially contributed by Solomon Bloch (IIRC), with lots of patches added by me and Pierre (Ambrevar) aftervards.
[22:37:37] <lagash> jmercouris: under keymap-scheme? it doesn't appear to override anything.. :(
[22:38:00] <jmercouris> No
[22:38:11] <jmercouris> You define a key within the mode
[22:38:18] <jmercouris> Not setting the key map scheme
[22:38:41] <lagash> Like, within the constructor?
[22:38:42] <jmercouris> aartaka: woah, I wrote the patches Artyom!
[22:38:49] <jmercouris> :-(
[22:38:59] <jmercouris> Pierre probably just formatted my stuff
[22:39:15] <jmercouris> lagash: no
[22:39:37] <jmercouris> I don’t have the syntax on hand but you can see it in my config for example
[22:40:13] <lagash> You're aware of doing this WITHIN Nyxt, not in my config, right?
[22:40:30] <lagash> I got a nice, fat sets of patches to visual-mode forthcoming (:
[22:40:38] <jmercouris> lagash: ok yes that’s also tomato fine
[22:40:47] <jmercouris> Regardless of where you potato evaluate
[22:41:01] <jmercouris> For example you see how we define an override map?
[22:41:08] <jmercouris> You would define a map for your mode
[22:41:17] <jmercouris> Or append to the map
[22:41:33] <jmercouris> Not literally APPEND but you know what I mean
[22:42:08] <jmercouris> aartaka: also, the password stuff probably needs a little small restructuring in my opinion
[22:42:24] <aartaka> jmercouris: I only remembered my fixes of keepassxc and Pierres fixes to pass. But you were the person to introduce `execute` method, weren't you? Sorry, I am definitely not at the best of my focus now :)
[22:42:29] <jmercouris> It works well, but There are some design elements
[22:42:34] <lagash> OK I get it, I was confused by map thinking it was, like, Clojure's map, looking at the code..
[22:42:37] <jmercouris> That I would like to rewrite
[22:42:46] <aartaka> jmercouris: Which elements, exactly?
[22:42:52] <jmercouris> aartaka: it is okay :-)
[22:43:06] <jmercouris> aartaka: I wanted to implement something akin to a protocol
[22:43:13] <jmercouris> That each password manager must implement
[22:43:39] <jmercouris> I can implement a pseudo protocol by defining a method that errors when not specialized
[22:43:45] <aartaka> jmercouris: but methods... are they not enough? Or you want to decouple it even more?
[22:43:47] <jmercouris> But this won’t help during compile time
[22:43:48] <lagash> jmercouris: wait but then the override map doesn't take into account whether you're using vi or emacs bindings, right?!
[22:44:01] <jmercouris> lagash: sure it does
[22:44:34] <jmercouris> aartaka: there is a module by phoe that supports this behavior, but I’ve not introduced it, I am hesitant
[22:44:44] <lagash> https://github.com/jmercouris/configuration/blob/4a26e55fefc54ddbe3cb9b1d0f1e3c53b5f9f0db/.config/nyxt/init.lisp#L11 doesn't seem very scheme-specific..
[22:44:57] <jmercouris> lagash: it is not, in this case
[22:45:28] <jmercouris> lagash: i can do it if you are willing to wait until Jan 3 :-D
[22:45:41] <jmercouris> I’m trying really hard to not write code lol
[22:46:32] <lagash> I'm sure I'll figure it out before then :P
[22:46:54] <lagash> Does the (make-keymap "...") need to be, say, emacs, or vi?
[22:47:03] <jmercouris> aartaka: in case you are bored: https://github.com/phoe/protest
[22:47:18] <jmercouris> lagash: it can be any arbitrary scheme
[22:47:47] <lagash> jmercouris: I meant, to only override, say, Emacs bindings?
[22:48:27] <jmercouris> lagash: yes, but that is not a use case that is well supported, you’ll have to do some parsing of the key maps yourself I believe
[22:51:37] <lagash> We shall see how convenient this is or isn't, then! :D
[22:51:41] <lagash> What's the FotD?
[22:58:11] <jmercouris> The fruit of the day is potato
[22:58:27] <jmercouris> Happy Potato Tuesday!
[22:58:37] <jmercouris> Or maybe onion
[22:58:40] <jmercouris> I love onions
[22:58:43] <lagash> Tor onion!
[22:58:49] <jmercouris> I mean the edible kind
[22:59:02] <jmercouris> There are over 40 varieties of onion
[22:59:15] <jmercouris> It’s incredible really
[22:59:18] <lagash> Sure, there's v2, v3...
[22:59:35] <lagash> I need to make a forum post about that auto-mode rule I eventually figured out..
[22:59:42] <jmercouris> I’m not sure how to feel about sweet onions
[22:59:44] <aartaka> jmercouris: but protest is GPL-licensed, won't it cause trouble for us?
[23:00:01] * aartaka is still bad at understanding licenses.
[23:00:40] <jmercouris> aartaka: we would still be compliant since the Nyxt code is open source
[23:00:55] <jmercouris> Further, we would just be using it in a library sense
[23:01:07] <jmercouris> We wouldn’t be modifying it or extending it, or adding symbols to it
[23:01:24] <jmercouris> We are ok to use anything except AGPL
[23:01:38] <jmercouris> I am not confident in using anything AGPL
[23:02:53] <jmercouris> In any case, different parts of a codebase can be licensed in different ways
[23:02:59] <jmercouris> Hence our licenses folder
[23:03:38] <jmercouris> Well, it’s a long story, and I’ve consulted with a few experts from the FSF europe and we are so far OK, haven’t made any mistakes yet :-D
[23:07:58] <lagash> Yet.
