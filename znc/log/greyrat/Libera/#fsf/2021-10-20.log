[00:00:13] <SoF> that is my question, does my described setup abide by its terms?
[00:00:36] <LiaoTao> SoF, I think he means that you should license the library with the bindings separately under LGPLv3
[00:00:52] <yrk> LiaoTao: no, I don't mean that
[00:01:00] <LiaoTao> Nevermind then
[00:01:19] <LiaoTao> Isn't there an ambivalence if they are just bindings for the underlying library?
[00:02:22] <SoF> if that question is directed at me, I don't understand it
[00:02:57] <LiaoTao> SoF, I guess I'm trying to find out in what way the bindings are published and if that has an impact
[00:03:24] <LiaoTao> If it's all internal to the library, then you should be fine as long as you adhere to the rest of the LGPL
[00:03:42] <yrk> LiaoTao: I agree with that last statement

[00:04:08] <SoF> the bindings would be public in a separate -sys crate, if you're familiar with rust
[00:04:12] <SoF> so not internal to the library
[00:04:22] <LiaoTao> Right, so that was what I assumed from the very beginning - hence the uncertainty
[00:05:17] <LiaoTao> Seems like a dubious proposition to be able to effectively relicense LGPL headers by sticking a thin veneer on top
[00:05:23] <LiaoTao> But maybe that's what LGPL is for? :P

[00:05:47] <SoF> I mean, it's not like the user can do much without the actual library itself
[00:05:53] <yrk> LiaoTao: no, nothing is being re-licensed according to the description
[00:06:34] <yrk> SoF: read the LGPL, and if needed write in to licensing@fsf.org with questions. but I don't actually see a problem with what you are proposing

[16:27:25] <DiffieHellman> M6piz7wk[m]: Just write replacement libre firmware for your wireless card and load that up, ez (not very).
[16:27:51] <M6piz7wk[m]> aAAAAAAAAAAaaaAAAaaAAaaaAAaAAaaAAaaAAAAAAAAaaAAAaaAAAaaAAAAAAAAaaAAAaaAAAaaAAAAAAaaaAAAaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAaaaAAAaaAAaaaAAaAAaaAAaaAAAAAAAAaaAAAaaAAAaaAAAAAAAAaaAAAaaAAAaaAAAAAAaaaAAAaaaaa
[16:29:05] <DiffieHellman> I do wonder why not one person has written libre firmware for one of the few 802.11ac chipsets that exist.
[16:29:26] <M6piz7wk[m]> FSF not being FSF-y enough i guess
[16:29:31] <M6piz7wk[m]> spend the milion in bank!
[16:29:41] <M6piz7wk[m]> instead of laying on it like a dragon on coins~
[16:30:47] <DiffieHellman> I mean, most 802.11n chipsets are fully libre and 802.11n tends to be more reliable than 802.11ac and not that much slower.
[16:31:49] <M6piz7wk[m]> i will still use any opportunity to poke FSF to utilize the resources better~
[16:31:59] <M6piz7wk[m]> imagine how many cool FLOSS games could we have
[16:32:04] <M6piz7wk[m]> maybe even a starship
[16:32:10] <M6piz7wk[m]> and colonize a planet with only Libre things
[16:32:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> ... well rather not
[16:32:19] <M6piz7wk[m]> it's FSF so it would be proprietary hardware
[16:32:21] <M6piz7wk[m]> ehwwwww
[16:32:45] <DiffieHellman> I mean if there's a planet free of proprietary software, sign me up for a one way trip.
[16:33:06] <M6piz7wk[m]> what if it's not breathable there
[16:33:15] <M6piz7wk[m]> oh one-way trip

[16:38:56] <lightbringer> most planets in the universe are free of proprietary software
[16:41:21] <M6piz7wk[m]> well most planets in the universe have a flora and/or fauna on them based on our current finding and assuming that we are carbon-based technology which is just composed of huge amount of binaries that we can't easily hexedit without causing a fatal malfunction then i assume that most of the life out there is proprietary
