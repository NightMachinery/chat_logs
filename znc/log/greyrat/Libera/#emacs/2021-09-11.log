[01:13:44] <maddog> parsnip: yeah, they are. of course here in california its pretty much the prolongations of intersections. no need for anything to be marked to make it a cross walk. or, a marked crosswalk or other such markings. (CVC 275)

[01:14:26] <parsnip> right, i only recently learned about the definition of "unmarked crosswalk", as i thought i was jaywalking on a weird part of my work commute
[01:14:31] <bpalmer> yates_work: no; they return integers.
[01:14:32] <parsnip> turns out i wasn't
[01:14:49] <maddog> parsnip: oh yeah.. hehe nope not j-walking
[01:14:51] <bpalmer> markers are like point values, but they track insertions and deletions so you're at the same proximate point.
[01:14:58] <parsnip> maddog: what i'm not clear on, is if this applies along varying degrees of arterials
[01:15:18] <parsnip> like double yellow, etc
[01:15:20] <yates_work> bpalmer: i see. i guess they also carry the buffer

[01:16:36] <parsnip> right
[01:16:47] <acdw> i was in a band called proximal point

[01:17:34] <bpalmer> yates_work: goto-char doesn't respect the marker's buffer, so it requires a bit more work
[01:17:48] <bpalmer> you'd have to do something like (with-current-buffer (marker-buffer m) (goto-char m))
[01:18:45] <maddog> yates_work: just use registers. C-x r w to create and C-x r j to jump to the saved register.
[01:19:15] <yates_work> maddog: aha! yes, registers!! thanks!!! i had used this decades ago and forgot about it
[01:19:20] <bpalmer> C-x r w is dealing with window configurations; C-x r SPC is probably what you're thinking of.

[05:02:22] <wickedjargon> Question: When I want to jump down in a document in big chunks I usually go down by paragraph. The other ones such as C-v/M-v don't provide me with an intuitive sense of how far I jumped down.

[05:03:59] <parsnip> for paragraph
[05:04:24] <wickedjargon> thanks. bpalmer and parsnip 
[05:04:41] * TRS-80 also wrote a function to scroll line by line
[05:04:41] <wickedjargon> i wonder also if there is a package that can give me a "transition" when scrolling down
[05:04:57] <parsnip> oof, like animated jump? yikes
[05:05:09] <TRS-80> (for those cases where what you need is just off screen)
[05:05:11] <wickedjargon> like a "scrolling down" affect 
[05:05:25] <TRS-80> wickedjargon: I think it would not be as performant
[05:05:37] <parsnip> i guess you could set some sort of timer thing
[05:05:43] <parsnip> might be performant enough
[05:05:49] <bpalmer> wickedjargon: so something that is effectively like (forward-line 25) but it forwards a single line; redisplays; repeats 24 times?
[05:05:52] <parsnip> just seems a little tricky to code
[05:06:05] <parsnip> you probably want accelerate/decelerate too
[05:06:38] <parsnip> and i guess it would still jump line by line
[05:06:41] <parsnip> not sure how smooth
[05:06:49] <wickedjargon> bpalmer, yes, I'd like to hit page down and get a similar affect to how a browser scrolls down

[05:08:13] <parsnip> if you start with no acceleration, you don't really need math, except maybe some "average" calc
[05:08:14] <wickedjargon> as an example: 1. open firefox. 2. go to a wikipedia article (a long one). 3. hit "END" on your keyboard

[05:09:06] <wickedjargon> i don't mind the time lost
[05:09:10] <TRS-80> probably would want to be able to configure: 1. delay between movements 2. how many lines to move per movement

[09:56:22] * bpalmer shakes fist. "They stole my idea!"
[09:57:23] <aidalgol> You know how you can wget a gzipped tar archive and pipe it to tar to extract it as a stream, instead of writing it to a file then deleting it afterwards?  Can you do that with zip archives?
[09:57:37] *** Quits: oxum (~oxum@106.203.195.217) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[09:57:50] <yeti> zip has the archive data @ the end
[09:57:52] <aidalgol> unzip(1) doesn't seem to support this.
[09:57:59] <yeti> the metadata
[09:58:05] <bpalmer> aidalgol: conceivably it could be buffered in memory rather than to a file on disk, but as I recall the zip format, there's a table of contents which can be anywhere.
[09:58:18] <aidalgol> Oh, it's a separate program: funzip
[09:59:17] <aidalgol> Except that can only extract a single entry.
[09:59:18] <aidalgol> ffs...
[09:59:34] <natter> I think one of the bsd tar commands can do that
[09:59:56] <bpalmer> ah, local file headers can be anywhere, but the only file header you're supposed to use is at the end, because entries can be marked deleted in subsequent appends to the file.
[10:00:14] <aidalgol> Sounds like a kinda messy format.
[10:00:23] <aidalgol> I guess tmpfs is good enough.
[10:00:39] <bpalmer> it's designed to be append-only, because writing to disks is expensive. 
[10:00:57] <aidalgol> I guess in those days it was.
[10:01:03] <bpalmer> (and the zip file could potentially straddle disks, too)
[10:01:34] <bpalmer> aidalgol: yet here you are trying not to write a file to disk :)
[10:02:32] <aidalgol> bpalmer: That's to save space in the docker layers.
[10:03:02] <codingquark> Very smart
[10:03:13] <aidalgol> OK, I lie.  I *was* another day doing this in a Dockerfile, but I solved that by using multi-stage builds.  Today, it is out of pure OCD.
[10:03:46] <TRS-80> re: append only; there is a clue in the name of the utility: Tape ARchive  ;)
[10:03:51] <codingquark> People normally do not think of such fine points. But it really is important to make sure your docker image doesn't have to build all of the damn layers if I change a config file
[10:04:09] <aidalgol> TRS-80: That's tar.  We were talking about zip.
[10:04:28] <aidalgol> bpalmer: You *were* talking about zip, weren't you?
[10:04:48] * TRS-80 forever misreading
[10:05:02] <aidalgol> codingquark: Yeah, that turned out to be biting us in the ass at my day job.  Our registry and build agents were filling up faster than they needed to.
[10:05:20] <bpalmer> aidalgol: yep
[10:05:24] <aidalgol> I spent a lot of time these past several weeks optimising our dockerfiles by pretty much rewriting them.

[10:10:19] <aidalgol> *transl8n plz

[10:10:59] <aidalgol> Also, what was the ruling?
[10:11:01] <codingquark> I prepared the base stuff like set of services and deployments and registries and networks and node configs and gave it to another guy who will now use it
[10:12:32] <bpalmer> aidalgol: apple is not a monopoly in the relevant market; but they do have to allow apps to link to places they can buy using non-apple pay methods. Epic has to pay apple a few million dollars.
[10:13:16] <bpalmer> oh, also, apps are free to ask users to register inside of apps and the apps can then communicate with the users without going through apple.
[10:13:28] <natter> libarchive/bsdtar support for streaming zip files is pretty nifty - code seems clean too. what a pleasant surprise.
[10:13:29] <aidalgol> Sounds like this would, in theory, mean that Google is not allowed to suspend your app if you have a PayPal link in it.

[10:33:10] <Sketch>   AROS is designed to be source-compatible with AmigaOS. On m68k Amiga hardware it is also binary-compatible, so binaries already compiled for AmigaOS 3 can be run on AROS.[6] On x86 IA-32 32-bit platforms Janus-UAE,[7] an enhanced E-UAE, integrates Amiga emulation directly into AROS to run AmigaOS m68k binaries nearly transparent to the user.

[12:07:50] <edgar-rft> I'm sure people in the psychiatry will love it
[12:08:12] <libertyprime> It integrates with any emacs buffer
[12:08:39] <libertyprime> You can generate both imaginary and real URLs from selected text in emacs, and visit them, even if they are not real
[12:08:49] <libertyprime> And they're very coherent
[12:09:39] <libertyprime> the interactivity of emacs makes it powerful.

[12:10:55] <libertyprime> it's the combination of real and imaginary that makes it powerful. i try to keep a real emacs and imagine the contents

[12:14:11] <libertyprime> the text is so coherent that it appears to be real but it is not. you can imaginae any website you can think of -- even ascii art websites. wikipedia articles, lesswrong articles, about any topic
[12:14:14] <codingquark> I feed it some text from a web page and it generates more. In this case it is a web page it could just as well be anything else, like we have seen examples of chats

[12:19:05] <codingquark> It finds out web pages talking about this and I click on them one by one to find relevant info
[12:19:13] <libertyprime> you could generate websites for that too. just generate a url with that query
[12:19:31] <libertyprime> or you can also use your query as the input for the selection if you want
[12:19:37] <libertyprime> it also asks for verification of your input
[12:19:42] <libertyprime> so you can put whatever query you want in there
[12:20:48] <codingquark> I see. Since it generates URLs for me for a given text, I could given it a long paragraph instead of these silly keywords and it may generate a URL for me. This URL may then turn out to be accurate.

[12:59:51] <fnstudio> hi, here's something i noticed with emacs notmuch
[13:00:01] <aidalgol> I hate to admit it, but I find Discord's UX to be overall better than the FOSS options.
[13:00:10] <fnstudio> hl-line-mode gets activated when entering a notmuch search buffer, i.e. a nice highlight-the-current-line effect; however, i noticed that the effect is "dormant" / non-visible upon entering the buffer, no line is highlighted
[13:00:30] <fnstudio> instead it only kicks in when one presses the down key or performs other similar actions
[13:01:03] <lordrishav_> aidalgol: Indeed
[13:01:14] <fnstudio> this has been confirmed by another user in #notmuch (sorry for cross-posting, i waited a bit before doing so)
[13:01:33] <fnstudio> i was curious to know your thoughts, e.g. if there's a technical or UX reason for this behaviour or if there's anything i can do to fix it
[13:02:00] <fnstudio> i put together some horrible hack just for the lulz: https://paste.debian.net/1211336/ but i'd be keen to know if there might be a sensible approach

[16:24:49] <twb> codingquark: the reason for all the extra shit is so that the "something you have" can be turned into "something you know"

[16:27:23] <twb> the same way "something you are" can be stolen by cutting off your finger or cutting our your eye

[19:28:22] <euouae> Also, it seems to have an address <number>@debbugs.gnu.org in the response field. That looks... wrong?
[19:28:33] <pkal> Usually you reply to everyone in the thread, but at the very least you should reply to the mailing list
[19:28:37] <twb> codingquark: do indians ever eat tofu?
[19:29:33] <pkal> That address collects all messages related to a bug. You should reply to that too, so that the message is indexed on https://debbugs.gnu.org/

[23:25:05] <johnjay> so i'm reading this book about automake and autoconf
[23:25:20] <johnjay> apparently in the 80s there were 4 main build systems. menuconfig, imake, gcc, and autoconf
[23:26:28] <johnjay> metaconfg and autoconf both used feature tests
[23:26:47] <twb> I don't believe menuconfig dates back to the 1980s
[23:26:48] <johnjay> so i guess that makes cmake closer to gcc and imake with config files per system?

[23:52:22] <dale> GNUHacker: If you switch to the buffer "*tramp/ssh user@192.168.1.50*" it will probably show you some kind of error message, hopefully.  You should not try and type in that buffer.
[23:54:16] <talismanick> I just realized that pasting into *scratch* (which I have set to fundamental-mode, to delay loading of prog-mode for the sake of startup time, due to all the packages hooked up to load on prog-mode-hook) preserves faces of the source text
[23:54:34] <talismanick> e.g. I pasted from ERC and it kept the theme highlighting
