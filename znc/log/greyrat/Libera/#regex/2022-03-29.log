[07:37:43] <re101-jackal-74> Hello there, this is probably an easy question but I'm kinda stuck. So I have this thing that matches the ip format, whatever the number is even after 255 and so on. Now, how can I make, if possible, to make the match stop **just** if after the last number there's a "." ; I'd like that it matches for: x.x.x.x + text here; text here + x.x.x.x ; but
[07:37:43] <re101-jackal-74> not x.x.x.x. https://regex101.com/r/PYpvHR/1
[07:39:19] <re101-jackal-74> To explain better, my point is just to avoid infinite loops; for example to __not__ match if 2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2
[07:39:57] <re101-jackal-74> match 2.2.2.2 but not 2.2.2.2".+eventual other numbers"
[07:40:04] <re101-jackal-74> working on javascript tho
[07:44:24] <digitok> should it only match if it is surrounded by either a space or nothing?
[07:44:34] <digitok> or are other, non-. chars allowed
[07:45:33] <re101-jackal-74> only match if : example: idk My  ip is x.x.x.x and now you know. || but __not__ matching something like : Oh I love this number 2.2.2.2.2.2.2
[07:45:52] <re101-jackal-74> so yea, I guess the first thing you said
[07:50:23] <digitok> so "hi, my ip is inside these parenthesis: (1.2.3.4) cool, huh?" = invalid
[07:50:24] <digitok> :D
[07:51:30] <digitok> see how you go with this https://regex101.com/r/PYpvHR/2
[07:51:35] <re101-jackal-74> let me try a sec yes
[07:51:37] <digitok> note this requires ES6 support
[07:51:47] <digitok> we can change it if needed
[07:53:36] <re101-jackal-74> Eh sorry but, what it's that actually
[07:54:09] <digitok> ecmascript 6
[07:54:40] <digitok> depends what browsers your tool app needs to support. most modern browsers support it
[07:54:47] <digitok> tool/app
[07:55:47] <re101-jackal-74> It's a discord server bot, I hope it could work. Anyway, the idea is totally right but.. well, you were right about that example, there's a way to  include also the ip being inglobated ?
[07:55:54] <re101-jackal-74> for example yeah into parenthesis
[07:56:26] <digitok> we can say "must not be surrounded by another digit or ."
[07:56:44] <digitok> like this https://regex101.com/r/PYpvHR/3
[07:57:48] <re101-jackal-74> How do you even
[07:57:49] <re101-jackal-74> well
[07:57:52] <re101-jackal-74> thank you
[07:57:58] <re101-jackal-74> I tried for 4 hours
[07:58:01] <digitok> yw :)

[14:43:39] <re101-eagle-2> Is there a way for regex101 to recognize \r instead of \n for the return character?.  I develop in vb.net, and the majority of my code uses \r and not \n.
[14:44:09] <M3r> you do have (*CR) 
[14:45:09] <M3r> Makes it so that only a carriage return character is considered a line break.
[14:46:42] <M3r> re101-eagle-2 you need to specify this option in the beginning of your regex
[14:48:56] <purplex> re101-eagle-2: not possible
[14:49:00] <re101-eagle-2> I'm not sure that i understand what you're saying.   When I paste a simple regex pattern that contains \r into your app, It doesn't work.  But it i change \r to \n, it works.  I'm just trying to alleviate having to do that.
[14:50:34] <M3r> ah I see... not sure thats possible. Purplex also says it isn't.

[15:41:12] <M3r> digitok: because I'm challenged to keep it as short as possible, I've got a long string of numbers that needs to be split with into groups of 4 numbers and later on divided by 44 and afterwards return the char that the int represents.. 
[15:43:44] <digitok> [regex]::matches("123456789123",'\d{4}') -join ", "
[15:43:45] <digitok> 1234, 5678, 9123
[15:44:48] <M3r> yep, ended up with something like that but I was wondering why split didn't work. I'm just curious.
[15:45:21] <M3r> ([regex]::matches($string,'\d{4,4}').value)-join""
[15:45:53] <M3r> oops not the entire line :P ([regex]::matches($string,'\d{4,4}').value|%{[char][int]($_/44)})-join"")
[15:47:38] <digitok> {4,4} == {4} btw
[15:47:57] <M3r> ah thanks
[15:51:22] <digitok> with split, it is a bit more complicated since you do not want to actually match the chars
[15:51:44] <digitok> you can do something like: "123456789123" -split '(?!^)(?=(?:\d{4})+$)'
[15:52:50] <M3r> oh thats right, you wanna split for the nothingness that is between the groups of 4 numbers
[15:53:05] <M3r> you/me in thirdperson
[15:53:28] <digitok> lol, yep
[15:55:14] <M3r> cheers and ty :)

[19:14:29] <OnlineCop> To be fair, I followed the json.org spec and it FAILED. Apparently, atomics require that the order be changed.
[19:15:12] <OnlineCop> They search for \{ then (?&ws) then \} and if that fails, try the other loop. But the atomics prevent (?&ws) from being backtracked into, so none of the alternates can be tested.
[19:15:26] <JohnDoe1> oh I see
[19:16:13] <OnlineCop> I've been _so_ tempted to actually write to them and ask them to reorder their standard so they reverse the order of their definitions.
[19:16:14] <re101-puffin-10> Hello I am trying to find a regex that converts this string "00.00.00,11.11.11,22.22.22" into a list of integer like this ['00.00.00', '11.11.11', '22.22.22'], thank you
[19:16:34] <OnlineCop> re101-puffin-10: Which regex language, and how many digits? Always 3 groups of 2 digits?
[19:16:41] <JohnDoe1> hahaha I wonder what their response might be
[19:16:57] <OnlineCop> (\d{2}(?:[.]\d{2}){2})
[19:17:03] <re101-puffin-10> ah python yeah 3 groups 2 digits or 1 digit
[19:18:23] <rewt> why not just split on comma?
[19:18:39] <OnlineCop> Obviously, I'd have to word it carefully with examples (and who knows? even point them to one of the earlier revisions... or fork one that matches their spec and show how it fails). You can't convince a group who have established a protocol decades old to modify their main documents without good reason.
[19:18:40] <re101-puffin-10> because it converts it into a list of string
[19:18:47] <re101-puffin-10> i want them to be numbers
[19:19:17] <OnlineCop> re101-puffin-10: Regex reads everything as a string; this one would give you 3 results.
[19:19:42] <OnlineCop> re101-puffin-10: https://regex101.com/r/AzAONQ/1
[19:20:07] <rewt> re101-puffin-10, you wanted strings in your example, and what kind of a number has 2 decimal points?
[19:20:14] <OnlineCop> If you can have 0.0.0 instead of 00.00.00, you can adjust the \d{2} to \d{1} or even use a range: \d{1,3}
[19:21:07] <OnlineCop> There's an outer capture that stores all of the inner matches/repetitions. If you want to further process each one individually, you could loop through the list that it returns and pull out the MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH values however you choose.
[19:22:08] <JohnDoe1> yeah that's exactly what I was thinking as well. Its age alone might be a deterrent.

[19:23:45] <OnlineCop> To be fair, my argument wouldn't be against the spec itself. Just that if the documentation were to take systems where backtracking were prohibited due to atomic reads, that altering the order would allow the same functionality but be able to be implemented "more globally."
[19:24:19] <JohnDoe1> true
[19:25:10] <purplex> any reason for \. or [.] or just personal preference, @Onlinecop.
[19:26:42] <re101-puffin-10> when i do the  re.split("(\d{1,3}(?:[.]\d{1,3}){2})", txt) it stores the commas as well is there any way to not store them?
[19:26:50] <re101-puffin-10> thank you by the way
[19:27:06] <OnlineCop> purplex: Mostly for better visibility that it's a literal. Plus, I've had to deal with "escape character" nightmares where I wanted to match a `\.` character but within several layers of abstraction (thanks, bash) and it turned into `\\\\\\.` or some other nightmare. With `[.]`, no escaping needed. :D
[19:27:32] <OnlineCop> re101-puffin-10: Shouldn't split() be using the comma as what you want to split on?
[19:27:41] <OnlineCop> Take a look at the Code Generator (left side of the page).
[19:27:48] <purplex> also an outer group was required? @Onlinecop ?
[19:28:16] <OnlineCop> purplex: You mean for puffin's example? So all 3 groups could be stored into a single match.
[19:28:43] <purplex> i see, clever
[19:28:51] <OnlineCop> `(\d{2})\.(\d{2})\.(\d{2})` could work as well, if you want the individual numbers extracted.
[19:32:07] <purplex> no wait, i meant the /2 
[19:32:58] <purplex> I mean there's a group 1 every math, can it be avoided by removing the outer ( ) ?

[19:36:13] <OnlineCop> Since there's a  (?:...){2}  in there, each of those would need to be written as individual groups if you didn't want it to "clobber" old group contents.
[19:36:56] <OnlineCop> You absolutely COULD do it this way, though: https://regex101.com/r/AzAONQ/3
[19:37:29] <purplex> yeah i meant https://regex101.com/r/AzAONQ/4
[19:38:08] <OnlineCop> Absolutely; you would just grab the matches instead of the groups, which would have contained the same values in this case. So that method is also good.

[23:44:28] <re101-badger-16> the dash can show/be in the middle of the string but it cannot be at the start or the end of the string
[23:45:02] <OnlineCop> From the beginning of the line, ensure that the next character (the first one) isn't '-'. Scan to the end of the line and ensure the last character isn't a '.'.
[23:45:23] <OnlineCop> The latter might need to be (?!.*-$)
[23:46:06] <purplex> yeah i was just about to say it it will backtrack and match abc-d :p
