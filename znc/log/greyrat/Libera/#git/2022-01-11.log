[02:49:56] <Nei> anyway if your rebase is done that means each commit which you rebased and altered was changed in itself
[02:50:27] <Nei> so all your commits should now be changed with the resolution you did
[02:50:30] <texasmynsted> none of the changes are on the branch

[02:51:19] <Nei> normally you do: git rebase XXX; and then at each conflict you fix it, git add fixed-files, git rebase --continue
[02:51:23] <texasmynsted> It only took about an hour so...
[02:51:36] <segfaultfizzbuzz> after using source control for years i went back to just flat files with occasional backups, and now for a project i have to use git to do version control. everything was going fine until,...
[02:51:56] <Nei> and after the end you will have each of your commits rewritten with the fixed version
[02:51:59] <texasmynsted> how do i do this rerere
[02:52:04] <segfaultfizzbuzz> i have some javascript blob and associated files which get generated, and i need to commit these javascript blob changes to a git repo

[02:52:33] <segfaultfizzbuzz> so at the moment what i am trying to do is simply cp -r the folder containing the javascript files over to the folder where i gave my git repo
[02:52:43] <Nei> segfaultfizzbuzz: normally you only commit sources and the pipeline assembles the blob

[02:53:18] <Nei> I think it will start working from when you enable it
[02:53:18] <segfaultfizzbuzz> but that doesn't seem to be working somehow
[02:53:26] <segfaultfizzbuzz> Nei: not quite sure what that means
[02:53:27] *** Quits: BSaboia (~bsaboia@177.37.198.83) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:53:48] <segfaultfizzbuzz> this javascript blob generator doesn't generate incremental changes or speak to git directly so,... am i doing something wrong in writing over these files...?
[02:53:56] <Nei> git is better at tracking source files than blobs
[02:54:13] <Nei> for example you store the source typescript in your git repo
[02:54:44] <segfaultfizzbuzz> okay but i have to make do
[02:54:45] <Nei> and then on the integration server there is a process which takes your repo, compiles it to javascript, webpacks and blobs it, and deploys it to the server
[02:55:12] <Nei> but if your process requires committing the blob then I guess there's nothing you can do to fix it
[02:55:29] <Nei> so it sounds to me like the thing you said you were doing, should approximately work
[02:55:36] <Nei> how do you know it doesnt work? any error?
[02:56:10] <segfaultfizzbuzz> i didnt make these choices,... my project requires that i use cloudflare pages with gitlab
[02:56:33] <segfaultfizzbuzz> cloudflare pages has an option where i can point it at a gitlab repo, and it says that it will deploy the most recent commit automatically
[02:57:06] <Nei> for example https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-an-angular-application
[02:57:06] <segfaultfizzbuzz> so i made it work for the first time a while back and just today tried to deploy the new javsacript blob
[02:57:14] <Nei> normally you would just commit your source code
[02:57:21] <Nei> and cloudflare will build the blob for you
[02:57:41] <Nei> you just tell cloudflare the command like "npx build"
[02:57:46] <segfaultfizzbuzz> yes so i (1) compiled the javscript blob (2) copied it to my folder containing my git repo (3) git add . ; git commit -m "i changed stuff" ; git push
[02:58:00] <segfaultfizzbuzz> and that does show in gitlab as a new commit, my "i changed stuff" message shows
[02:58:06] <segfaultfizzbuzz> and cloudflare shows the same message
[02:58:11] <Nei> sounds great
[02:58:15] <segfaultfizzbuzz> and cloudflare also notices the commit happening
[02:58:20] <segfaultfizzbuzz> but the page is identical
[02:58:26] <Nei> did you refresh your browser cache?
[02:58:30] <segfaultfizzbuzz> i've also loaded the page on another device in case my browser is being silly
[02:58:41] <Nei> then look at the commit diff
[02:58:44] <segfaultfizzbuzz> i guess i'll try it on a third device just to be 100% sure
[02:58:49] <Nei> does it really change the files you think it should?
[02:59:03] <Nei> and try to change the process so that you dont have to commit a blob
[02:59:22] <Nei> (1) should be done by cloudflare

[07:43:45] <jensen> i have a simple wrapper script for git to setup repo to an immediate workable state. Is there a simple way to `branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> <branch> for all branches without hardcoding? Preferably without ever having to checkout the branch

[11:04:08] <segfaultfizzbuzz> mackerman: the behavior i am hoping to achieve is that (1) i have blob.js in my local github repo (2) i copy ~/a/blob.js over to my local github repo, overwriting the blob.js file (3) i perform some git commands (such as the ones i listed above) concluding probably with a git commit/push and then (4) the result should be that in the master the blob.js file is the *new* blob.js file
[11:04:47] <segfaultfizzbuzz> currently when i copy ~/a/blob.js over to the local github repo, it appears to not overwrite the local file, which is confusing the heck out of me

[20:13:12] <mackerman> fabrao: Try ##github chanel for GitHub things
[20:13:45] <segfaultfizzbuzz> maybe i will try to ask my question again here:
[20:14:40] <segfaultfizzbuzz> i have a javascript blob, blob.js which gets generated in folder ~/a and i have an existing github repo in the folder ~/g which contains an earlier version of blob.js
[20:15:12] <segfaultfizzbuzz> i've already made an attempt at replacing ~/g/blob.js with ~/a/blob.js by copying the file over, git add . ; git commit -m "replace blob" ; git push
[20:15:26] <segfaultfizzbuzz> however the file doesn't seem to be overwritten with the new version, strangely
[20:15:57] <mannequin> https://allegro.pl/oferta/plyta-glowna-asus-prime-b450m-a-ii-am4-micro-atx-11191763001
[20:16:07] <mannequin> i think i will pick this one
[20:16:51] <fabrao> sorry mackerman

[20:17:25] <mannequin> oops wrong channel
[20:18:09] <imMute> segfaultfizzbuzz: "doesn't seem to be overwritten" ?
[20:18:22] <gnoo> segfaultfizzbuzz: try adding it explicitly, git add blob.js.  also, you can try git show -- blob.js, i think
[20:18:31] <imMute> segfaultfizzbuzz: it should be overwritten as soon as you do the copy.  and 'git status' after that and before the commit should show that the file is modified.

[22:01:25] <segfaultfizzbuzz> wow i am incredibly confused here. i host a simple web server (with caching disabled, software is simple-http-server from the rust ecosystem) in folder ~/a and my blob.js file is the most recent
[22:01:58] <segfaultfizzbuzz> i do a cp -ir ~/a . when i am in the git folder and say y to overwriting the files in the folder
[22:02:01] <segfaultfizzbuzz> i am prompted for all files
[22:02:33] <segfaultfizzbuzz> then if i host the simple web server in the git folder, the files are unchanged, as though they were not overwritten

[22:15:50] <segfaultfizzbuzz> i haven't done anything with my zfs configuration beyond the default installation.

[22:17:07] <segfaultfizzbuzz> i did delete a couple of files in the master repo which i have now copied back over
[22:17:29] <mackerman> Either the files you copied in are identical to already tracked files, or you aren't doing the copy you think you are
[22:17:43] <mackerman> Or maybe they match a  .gitignore
[22:17:55] <segfaultfizzbuzz> i did a diff and the files cannot be the same
[22:18:18] <segfaultfizzbuzz> let me be entirely specific: i have  ~/a/index.html   and ~/gitrepo/index.html and diff reports that they are indeed different
[22:18:41] <segfaultfizzbuzz> even after a cp -i and saying y to the prompt for copy they remain different
[22:19:45] <segfaultfizzbuzz> this is almost certainly irrelevant but the drive i am copying from is my main system SATA SSD with a ZFS filesystem whereas the drive i am copying to is an ext4 formatted SATA hard disk drive mounted in /mnt ... but as mentioned the permissions are fine so,...

[23:34:40] <fakuve> I manage various github accounts , and I'm using Linux CLI to push some repositories . The issue is that I got my git configured to `Username1` but I want to push now onto `Username2` and I'm basically doing `git push git@github.com:Username2/Username2.github.io` Obviously as I don't have authentified this user locally it gives me an error such as `ERROR: Permission to
[23:34:42] <fakuve> Username2/Username2.github.io.git denied to Username1` What would you do in my case?
