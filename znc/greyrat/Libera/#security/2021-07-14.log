[03:00:56] <Joanna> I’m not a quy so I’ll leave it to the others to answer
[03:01:20] <applegal> ok
[03:01:27] <applegal> do you value your privacy?
[03:01:54] * ajak uses pass
[03:01:59] <circuitbone> I use this for a generator. https://linux.die.net/man/1/pwgen it's classified how I store retrieve my work.
[03:04:06] <flyback> mats msp430 has not been around 30 yrs and also esp8266 can't go that low
[03:04:09] *** Quits: npc (~uoj6wz6qo@user/spareproject) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:04:11] <flyback> but it's still a great chip
[03:04:14] <applegal> https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-password-manager/
[03:04:29] <applegal> according to this site.. Bitwarden: Best free password manager
[03:04:45] * flyback still wants to build a rng using a radiation source or using uninitialized ram or both
[03:04:54] <applegal> do you guys think I should start using this password manager
[03:05:05] <flyback> I want to try to do a rng using just a 4-8 bit counter, unintialized ram and mabye a 555 for a clock gen
[03:05:29] <ajak> applegal: it's best to try things and use what you think is best
[03:05:38] <flyback> ill have every nth bit be a control pin on the counter to trigger power off on the sram
[03:06:10] <flyback> have to figure out either how to stop the clock or wait xxx seconds while the ram chip is turned back on before receiving any new numbers
[03:06:27] <flyback> oh well might just make one for my next generation of xmas tree
[03:06:51] <flyback> the first one I built because I hated that they used a stupid color wheel and motor and hot halogen bulb to light the fibers
[03:06:58] <flyback> it's always the same pattern alterating on the disc
[03:07:14] <flyback> so I gutted a fiber optics xmas tree and put in 9 rgb auto ccycling leds
[03:07:37] <flyback> I lucked out the timers in the rgb leds are not precise so they all fall out of cycle with each other
[03:07:54] <flyback> so I get a nice random pattern but the next one I Might actually need to generate my own randomizer
[03:08:15] <flyback> it's also a neat project for very low end mcu's or homemade cpu designs to have a rng
[03:09:34] <flyback> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrtomtpDv2g
[03:09:58] <flyback> unfortunitely the tree is dying after 10-15 yrs the glue that holds the fake pine needles is going and it's shedding more and more every year

[03:11:41] <flyback> anyways the point about the tree was it's a good starting point to work on a rng that mabye isn't good enough cryptographically to start but gives you sme experience making one

[03:29:29] <jessicara> there is one problem with such
[03:29:38] <mats1> its easy to remember passwords when you deviate from the usual help desk garble about '1 upper, 1 lower, 1 symbol, 1 number, fuck yourself, etc' that deliberately makes it hard for people to remember passwords
[03:29:45] <jessicara> you have to encode it because sites don't accept them as passwords
[03:29:46] <jessicara> lol
[03:29:55] <jessicara> yeah..
[03:30:08] <jessicara> unfortunately sites do not cooperate and even in some annoying cases don't allow more than 16-char passwords

[03:35:42] <jessicara> yeah 10-20 passwords way beyond me

[03:38:26] <TimMc> Not much more than that.
[03:38:37] <mats1> the basic boojum is also that passwords are garbage, but people are too incompetent to manage privkeys safely
[03:38:38] <TimMc> And good lord, I apparently still remember my high school locker combination.
[03:38:49] <mats1> so here we are
[03:39:18] <jessicara> yeah, so encrypt private key with password and treat it like it's fire
[03:39:19] <plasticuproject> TimMc: I remember mine too. Just put in on 6 and yank down really fucking hard.

[03:39:35] <TimMc> plasticuproject: Oh, mine involves hitting it with a sneaker.
[03:41:01] <TimMc> My passwords for random websites all look like "Howard-untreated-obliviousness" or "robber_Lisa6carbs"
[03:41:22] <jessicara> mine look suspiciously base64
[03:41:33] <TimMc> A few random dictionary words from `shuf /usr/share/dict/words | head -n20` and then chuck some symbols and numbers in there to meet the password requirements.
[03:41:46] <TimMc> Oh yeah, I also have some like Q%<o$Xg\K1,O
[03:42:10] <TimMc> Those are generated with this: tr -dc '[:print:]' < /dev/urandom | head --bytes 12; echo
[03:42:28] <TimMc> Or my browser generates them, and they're alphanumeric only.
[03:42:40] <jessicara> the not storing them means the tool generates them when tell it what to generate it for
[03:42:57] <jessicara> ...the first version of this actually was a problem
[03:43:26] <jessicara> i had the stupid idea to measure resposes from hardware so when i unplugged a joypad and plugged it in the wrong port the entire secret number changed
[03:43:42] <TimMc> haha oh no
[03:43:43] <jessicara> so i lost all my passwords until figured out how to recreate that

[03:44:22] <jessicara> yeah so you end up lugging around a fingerprint to pretend it has and just not do that anymore

[03:45:53] <circuitbone> If you have me, you want to share me. If you share me, you haven't got me. What am I?
[03:46:00] <TimMc> So what do you do when you generate a password, and the site says "no, your password must add up to a prime number" or whatever?
[03:46:35] <jessicara> TimMc: the 3rd version dealt with this by having 3 different versions to choose from with different restrictions
[03:46:53] <jessicara> one of them will probably work unless it's particularly bad
[03:47:00] <TimMc> So then when you go to log in, you have to remember which one to use?
[03:47:21] <jessicara> ah you can write that kinda stuff down, it's a lot like having * marked out in passwd
[03:47:29] <TimMc> ah hmm
[03:47:39] <jessicara> part of it is also being able to just add to the hash
[03:47:51] <jessicara> so can add an iterator and +1 it every time change password
[03:47:57] <TimMc> makes sense
[03:48:05] <TimMc> So you can have a public password book that seeds and selects.
[03:48:11] <jessicara> yeah
[03:49:08] <TimMc> And if you lose the password book, you at least can recreate it.
[03:49:18] <jessicara> otherwise, it's a lot like a crummy password manager without storing the passwords
[03:49:21] <jessicara> yeah
[03:49:57] <jessicara> in theory could just completely avoid any passphrase at all, just read from external storage which is only plugged in when generating
[03:50:00] <TimMc> That's neat. I've never looked very deeply into deterministic password managers.
[03:50:18] <jessicara> but something instinctively tells me that promiscuous usb devices are a threat
[03:50:38] <TimMc> I guess I still feel pretty leery of the whole thing.
[03:50:48] <jessicara> yeah
[03:50:48] <mats1> especially in present day, now that usb3 has dma
[03:51:10] <jessicara> at least with roll your own shenanigans raise the bar to figuring out what the meow you are doing too
[03:51:11] <jessicara> lol
[03:51:17] <TimMc> A traditional password manager is two-factor -- someone has to get the encrypted data *and* learn the passphrase. But for yours, someone just has to get the passphrase.
[03:51:28] <jessicara> yeah
[03:53:48] <TimMc> But... there's also the slight chance of the crypto being flawed on the encrypted password store.
[03:54:09] <jessicara> part of why originally it measured the hardware responses
[03:55:05] <jessicara> stuff like a kernel module sitting there intercepting and faking things
[03:55:13] <jessicara> is likely to change some call or other
[03:55:16] <Joanna> Passwords don’t prevent backdoors and I’d never trust my passwords to a password manager I would write on paper
[03:55:56] <jessicara> i don't think i could say for certain that the measurements are good enough, but there was an attempt
[03:57:23] <jessicara> the two factor thing is a good point, something to concider in the next version

[04:15:53] <TimMc> onceuponatimetherewas shows up 15 times in Pwned Passwords
[04:17:28] <TimMc> jessicara: There's a tremendous amount of redundancy in English text. Redundancy is not something you want in passwords.
[04:17:32] <circuitbone> no one is suggesting you use once apon a time without additinal ascii. The point is you can recall long winded if you combine it with something that the user recalls easier
[04:17:38] <TimMc> unless you really *love* typing
[04:18:16] <jessicara> all the more reason for some extra external source to seed the generator i think

The point was that you can recall longform strings if you apply it to something you have already memorised in your life.  appending it with additional random characters can form part of the phrase.

[09:41:33] <menace> microwave covers are stuff which you put over the bowl so the stuff from the bowl won't splash around in the microwave (which it does because of the specific heating mechanism) and won't stick on the ceiling of the microwave for example
[09:43:22] <plasticuproject> Why would such a specific thing exist, and why would you purchase it?
[09:43:39] <plasticuproject> I just put a napkin or an upside down plate over top of whatever it is.

[09:49:35] <NiLon> that makes unnecessary waste and doesn't work well with say soup

[09:50:12] <plasticuproject> I do it all the time with soup
[09:50:42] <plasticuproject> And it probably less wasteful that filling up a dishwasher with some useless junk and running it.
[09:50:48] <NiLon> you could just put a cover on it and get it done ezpz :p

[09:52:25] <NiLon> there are glass versions too if you prefer that
[09:53:37] <mats1> for the unwashed among us, plastic is the worst shit to have in a kitchen, it accrues bacteria and virii at dramatically higher rates than, say, wood
[09:53:59] <plasticuproject> REAL TALK, sometimes I use a napkin, sometimes I use a small plate. And if I use a plate I just rinse it off and put it back, but don't tell my wife that I didn't use soap.
[09:54:01] <mats1> your bathroom is likely to be cleaner than your kitchen
[09:55:13] <mats1> (consider the sheer volume of organics and surface area that go through a kitchen on any given day. its a petri dish of shit)

[23:25:11] <ajak> the server wouldn't try to balance the load?
[23:26:19] <piou> There are different strategies and throttling is one of them. Not exactly the most common but still. Besides, what is balancing if not voluntarily limiting the allocated bandwith?
[23:27:23] <ajak> if you have 10 connections you don't have to allocate all of your upload to the first connection, you can try to upload to all of them equally
[23:27:31] <piou> yes
[23:28:10] <piou> my comment stands accordingly
[23:28:41] <piou> Besides, I guess that if you are downloading a lot of small files they could have a noticable overhead big enough to see an improvement by parallelizing. I wonder how much of an impact there is though.
[23:28:41] <MadCamel> not common, most webservers just serve as fast as they can. Most websites have a lot of small files and the http overhead/latency slows things down enough where parallel mirroring is a huge win.
[23:30:36] <ajak> ah i guess i'm underestimating http overhead/latency, that makes sense though
[23:31:30] <TimMc> It's generally considered rude to download a website as fast as possible... *and* you're more likely to be noticed. :-)
