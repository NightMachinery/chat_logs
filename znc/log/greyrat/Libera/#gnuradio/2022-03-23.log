[19:31:45] <drmpeg> You have to use a newer version of castXML for gcc10.
[19:35:26] <drmpeg> I think.

[20:22:46] <tnt> patchvonbraun[m]: why the splitter ?
[20:22:49] <bkerler[m]> what's that after the splitter patchvonbraun ? filter or amplifier ?
[20:23:40] <tnt> my guess would be filter given the lack of any power feed.
[20:24:07] <tnt> (need more resolution pic :p)
[20:24:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> tnt: We're using two different wavelengths, but have only one receiver right now, so we're going to TDM between two.   Those boxes are 750MHz low-pass "LTE" filters.  The 10.7cm side uses a downconverter that converts down to around 500MHz.  The other side is 21cm "straight".  Dual polarization, so two channels.
[20:24:27] <bkerler[m]> I'd expect to be bias-t, because filter or amp should be at the antenna I guess
[20:24:56] <bkerler[m]> ah, filter, I see.
[20:25:11] <patchvonbraun[m]> https://photos.app.goo.gl/PU4MJrvUYPseKGVT8   for the actual google photo link
[20:25:54] <patchvonbraun[m]> The OOB rejection on the 21cm side is already good enough, so no extra filter on that input to the combiner/splitter.
[20:26:23] <bkerler[m]> ok, what about the loss ? what amplifier do you use to compensate it ?
[20:26:45] <patchvonbraun[m]> There are amplifiers up at the antenna feed
[20:26:55] <patchvonbraun[m]> The fitlers are about 4dB loss.  Not a big deal.
[20:27:17] <patchvonbraun[m]> The front-end amplifiers (or LNBs) have about 36dB gain.  On a 14m dish.
[20:28:31] <bkerler[m]> and what source do you use for frequency stabilization ? gpsdo oxco ?
[20:29:15] <patchvonbraun[m]> Don't need super-stable frequency for this project.   The 2.5PPM of the B210 is fine.   
[20:29:42] <bkerler[m]> ok, was expecting something like <1ppm :D
[20:29:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> In radio astronomy there's really only a couple of cases where you need really good clocks--pulsar observations and interferometry.

[20:33:54] *** Joins: yesno (~yesno@109.98.151.62)
[20:39:22] <patchvonbraun[m]> We expect to be making daily observations in the next few weeks.  KInda boring, though.  We're not driving the dish to track initially.  And the "quiescent" state of J1430+2303 is too weak for our dish to "see" it.  
[20:42:47] <patchvonbraun[m]> We may start out by making daily observations of Tau A (Crab Nebula) to see how things behave, and it's only 1deg lower than the ultimate target object, so it will help us with pointing.
[20:59:59] <ghostop14[m]> <bkerler[m]> "I got gcc10 and ubuntu 22.04..." <- Wonder if 22.04 has a newer version of a submodule that's causing the issue.

[21:13:25] <bkerler[m]> no I meant pybind on which module ? or in general ?

[21:13:48] <ghostop14[m]> Happens in any of them.
[21:14:15] <bkerler[m]> ok, for your oots I can confirm it worked fine, because I compiled them already with gcc 10 and ubuntu 22.04 (with gr 3.11 git)
[21:14:42] <ghostop14[m]> Yeah, I have an Ubuntu 20.04 docker I use too that doesn't have gcc-10 and bind works fine there.
[21:14:43] <bkerler[m]> I meant bind command as well :D
