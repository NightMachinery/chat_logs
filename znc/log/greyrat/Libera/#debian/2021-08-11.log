[00:54:36] <Khepra> it's also a dumb LRU cache mind you.   you could also try something like ZFS. counterintuitively maybe, but ARC has multiple caches, most prominent of them being the MFU (Most Frequently Used) which helps _tremendously_ in a MFU-fits-RAM scenario

[00:55:08] <neilthereildeil> can i tune the caching algorithm in the storage subsystem of the kernel?
[00:55:19] <neilthereildeil> or tell to ti switch toe MRU or something?
[00:55:23] <Khepra> you can tweak page/block sizes in the zvol, there's snapshotting, and you can help your poor raid of rust centrifuges with one or two ultra fast NVMe SSDs in intermediate caching roles, especially to buffer sync writes.

[01:02:14] <neilthereildeil> ahh ok
[01:03:10] <Khepra> I'd bet a whole cow here, and I'd throw in a goat for good measure, that your kernel is already caching most it can. taht'd be the default kernel behaviour unless you misconfigured something, like direct IO.
[01:04:25] <Khepra> simply put, a raid5 of spinners is going to be _terrible_ for random io. that's jsut a sad fact. the best you can do here is add some buffering in form of a nvme via bcache or, seriously, look into ZFS as ARC has a few more knobs and better algos than the default kernel

[16:25:42] <Dom_> how do i bridge and more important insert the PIN other than by the webinterface?
[16:27:34] <Franciman> Khepra: if you want a concrete question
[16:27:43] <Franciman> does debian work fine with touch screen monitors?
[16:29:03] <Blondie101010> Dom_:  99% of consumer devices are made to be configurable through a GUI or webUI and not CLI, but check with the manufacturer for details
[16:29:40] <Dom_> so it could be there is no other way than webinterface?
[16:29:55] <Blondie101010> sounds plausible there isn't
[16:30:30] <Dom_> :-(
[16:30:53] <Blondie101010> for your bridging question, not sure how it would make sense to bridge your edge router
[16:31:17] <Blondie101010> or modem 
[16:31:55] <Blondie101010> a bridge is to connect devices to the same LAN, while routing is used to connect from one network to another
