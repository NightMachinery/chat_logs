[12:52:14] <artagnon> Hi, what news_server should I use for comp.mail.mutt?
[12:53:18] *** Joins: spare (~p7znalyiq@user/spareproject)
[12:55:15] <init0> which ever you have access to? :=)
[12:57:06] <artagnon> Sorry, I'm new to usenet. Aren't there high-quality freely accessible usenet servers?
[13:00:38] <artagnon> I have some minor experience with mail-to-news gateways, and I'm assuming comp.mail.mutt is also a mail-to-news gateway. The git mailing list is available over nntp.lore.kernel.org, for instance.

[13:05:08] <init0> well unless your provider already give you access there are a tons of providers.
[13:06:01] <init0> if you don't care about binary groups. you can get a free account on https://www.eternal-september.org/ for example

[13:59:41] <joo-_> Lets say i dont want to store my emails in googles server no more, can I download them with fetchmail and put them inside a git repo - perhaps with lfs , because attachments ?
[14:04:52] <joo-_> also why i get the disown command not found when trying to view pdf files? (viewer = evince)
[14:05:37] <joo-_> oops the disown was in my mailcap :-)
[14:06:17] *** Joins: feriman (~feriman@46-133-76-255.mobile.vf-ua.net)
[14:11:47] <init0> while it should work - mutt doesn't care if them local files are in git. I guess that git repo will be blown up to a quite large size after a while ;)
[14:13:40] <init0> and why git? to get access on different devices? imap is the better tool for that. if you dont trust google run your own imap 
[14:16:57] *** Joins: cdown (~cdown@188.214.11.14)
[14:25:39] <init0> question is why use their (google) email then
[14:29:51] <furrymcgee> mutt can read and write messages in mbox format
[14:30:40] <init0> mbox is so 80ies. Maildir^^
[14:35:48] *** Quits: maroloccio (~marolocci@151.75.59.229) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0)
[14:38:28] <furrymcgee> how to read Maildir with mutt -f?
[14:38:56] <init0> sure
[14:40:11] <init0> well or navigate there with the browser
[14:43:14] <furrymcgee> how to save tagged messages in maildir?
[14:45:24] <init0> mbox_type=Maildir
[14:45:52] <init0> then just work with it as if it was mbox
[14:46:33] <init0> eg. <tag-prefix-cond><save-message>=foo<enter> 
[14:47:03] <init0> where =foo then is a maildir
[14:50:13] <joo-_> ofcause i want to get away from google asap , but i am also afraid of data loss storing stuff on my own server
[14:50:39] <joo-_> so maybe i will have to make a backup solution and just keep in the maildir
[14:58:53] *** Quits: spare (~p7znalyiq@user/spareproject) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:59:05] <furrymcgee> git can be pushed upstream and gives you a hash of that directory see also https://public-inbox.org/README
[15:27:48] <furrymcgee> thanks for helping with maildir, I would like to have option -f accept a directory an set mbox_type
