[08:19:27] <Cecen> NFTs are an embarassment
[08:19:27] <_genuser_> moose nice thanks for explaining
[08:19:30] <moose> Cecen: I disagree.
[08:19:39] <_genuser_> how so Cecen
[08:19:57] <Cecen> There may be some niche cases around licensing where they could have value, but 'owning a virtual trading card' isn't it
[08:19:59] <moose> I think they have actual legitimate use, and true value to the crypto ecosystem as well as people and businesses NOT currently in the cryptocurrency space.
[08:20:00] <_genuser_> I personally think NFTs are betwen what they're claimed to be and being useless.
[08:20:02] <Cecen> Likewise with using NFTs in games
[08:20:07] <moose> Cecen: It is not a virtual trading card.
[08:20:10] <DevJohnC> crypto is an embarassment
[08:20:16] <moose> An NFT is a digitally enforced contract.
[08:20:25] <_genuser_> DevJohnC are you in general not in favor of crypto currency?
[08:20:39] <_genuser_> I see NFTs as proof of ownership and nothing else.
[08:20:49] <moose> DevJohnC: Maybe you should go back to trading oil futures then or perhaps sinking all of your money into federal bonds of some kind.
[08:21:03] <Cecen> It's a proof of ownership of some non-material thing.
[08:21:11] <DevJohnC> _genuser_, when you boil it down crypto is based on converting energy into currency, which means it's never going to be ecological and thus probably will always suck
[08:21:15] <moose> Cecen: That's not necessarily true, either.
[08:21:24] <moose> It can be, but it doesn't have to be.
[08:21:31] <moose> I have property that I own via NFT.
[08:21:32] <_genuser_> none of that "it's for super rare digital items." lol, anything digital can be easily copied. Only in legal conversation can the ownership help. Licensing, etc.
[08:21:35] <Cecen> If that non-material thing can very well be a virtual trading card. I've yet to see anyone suggest a real scenario where an NFT provided literally any value
[08:21:40] <moose> Tangible assets, owned via NFT.
[08:21:42] <DevJohnC> an NFT isn't proof of ownership, it's proof of transaction
[08:21:53] <DevJohnC> people "sell" NFTs they don't have rights to sell
[08:22:05] <_genuser_> DevJohnC the new Proof of Stake, tries to do away with expensive computing power.
[08:22:11] <moose> DevJohnC: Sure, which is why it's important to know what you are doing. Just like people sell software they don't have rights to.

[08:22:42] <_genuser_> DevJohnC but majority of our dollars as is are stored digitally. I don't think there's actual number of dollars printed as there is wealth.

[08:23:24] <DevJohnC> _genuser_, I have nowhere near the economical education required to have THAT discussion but that's not the same as crypto currency
[08:24:09] <_genuser_> DevJohnC agreed, I'm not that economically educated either. I just see fiat currency as having value because we agree it does. and crypto currency as having value because we agree it does. Let's see how it plays out.
[08:24:10] <moose> Cecen: Alright so say you are an up and coming artist of some kind, music industry or something. You want to get some funding to pay for studio time, whatever. You have some really loyal small fan base but you need to kickstart and because the music industry is more of a "get recognized and hit it" and not so much "fund me slowly as an investment" like tech is, this opens it up to that kind of investment. You sell an NFT which can be cashed in for a day with
[08:24:10] <moose> you, dinner, something fun and engaging a fan may like.
[08:24:22] <moose> A fan can choose to cash it in, or wait, an sell it. Maybe sell them initially for $500-$1000 or more depending on your status.
[08:24:27] <Cecen> The money you own is kept in a ledger by trusted institutions with legal obligations, even if it's not a real physical thing
[08:24:39] <moose> Imagine if you had a day with Tom Cruise as an NFT today, it would be worth millions.
[08:24:49] <moose> It's basically the concept of baseball cards, but people can make them before they're ever a star.
[08:24:54] <DevJohnC> _genuser_, yup, money is made up
[08:24:57] <moose> They become exceptionally collectible.
[08:25:17] <Cecen> But baseball cards are physical objects. Each one is unique and can't be duplicated.
[08:25:33] <_genuser_> DevJohnC but NFT would be proof of ownership, such as in the case of BAYC collection. Larva Labs, I believe it the creator. They sell those apes via an NFT. They also sell all rights to the Ape you purchase. You can go and make movie deals with it, create stories around that character and sell a whole bunch of merchadise.
[08:25:35] <moose> Sure, tons will be bust and worth nothing. That's fine, so are baseball cards. But the point is, you buy in to a person or idea you actually like. It's an investment vehicle and also a support system
[08:25:48] <moose> Cecen: Correct, and NFTs created by a specific person are absolutely unique if they deem them to be.
[08:26:03] <_genuser_> DevJohnC in that case legally, only the holder of the NFT sold by Larva Labs has legal rights to that Ape. All others will lose in court.
[08:26:12] <Cecen> You're missing the point. The thing you're owning can be *perfectly* duplicated at no cost by the issuer.
[08:26:16] <moose> For example, Gary Vaynerchuk made a bunch of awful art into NFTs. Like, kids drawings he made. They're shit. People paid hundreds of millions for them, because they're authentic original work from an extremely influential dude.
[08:26:43] <moose> So, sure someone can copy them, but they're not original work nor authentic.
[08:26:49] <_genuser_> Cecen the thing can be. it's ownership can't be. So if you go to court, you can prove your ownership. The others can't. They will be shut down. Legally they can't make money off what you own the rights to.
[08:26:51] <moose> They're like a reproduction of famous art.
[08:26:52] <Cecen> How are they not the original work nor authentic?
[08:26:55] <DevJohnC> _genuser_, so? we could already do all those things without NFTs?
[08:26:57] <Cecen> They're literally exact copies
[08:27:09] <moose> Cecen: They're not, the value is in the digital signature from the originator's wallet.
[08:27:33] <moose> You can buy an exact replica of a Rolex, but it's still not a Rolex.
[08:27:54] <_genuser_> DevJohnC we can. And we do. I was only providing an example of what I can see an NFT doing. However, one big thing is, your rights can't be revoked. Because nobody can forcefully take your NFT.
[08:28:00] <DevJohnC> comparing digital goods to physical goods is apples to oranges
[08:28:01] <moose> I own an actual Rolex because I like the brand, the history, all of that. I could've saved $14,000 and bought a duplicate and had the exact same form and function.
[08:28:03] <moose> But it wouldn't be a Rolex.
[08:28:11] <Cecen> No, you can't.
[08:28:11] <moose> Same concept.
[08:28:16] <moose> Yes, you really really can.
[08:28:17] <Cecen> Every object is physically different and unique.
[08:28:34] <moose> Sure, but who cares? Nobody would notice the difference, not even I without taking it apart lol
[08:28:49] <_genuser_> DevJohnC however, lol, a court might say that legal contract on paper or on NFT is invalid and real ownership goes to <somebody_with_money_like_the_RIAA>
[08:28:51] <moose> and even then, it's just manufacturing differences. The quality and how it functions is identical.
[08:29:15] <DevJohnC> I like whole file namespaces, it saves a nesting level that's nice
[08:29:31] <Cecen> google.com how to spot a fake rolex
[08:29:45] <moose> Cecen: Yeah, I have taken classes on watch authentication because I collect.
[08:29:54] <moose> I am aware of how to spot one, but fakes are quite good and you need to disassemble them.
[08:29:55] <Cecen> You can't make something even remotely close to an exact copy of a Rolex without an identical supply chain and manufacturing process
[08:30:02] <moose> Some fakes are bad fakes.
[08:30:12] <_genuser_> moose dang you're turning out to be an interesting critter. a watch collector, too?
[08:30:22] <moose> _genuser_: Yes, I am often described as a weirdo.
[08:30:35] <moose> I have a uranium collection too.
[08:30:43] <moose> Hobbies man, you need them or you go crazy.
[08:30:50] <_genuser_> moose I have recently started looking into watches. lol my current collection is fossil and ted baker.
[08:30:59] <moose> That's awesome!
[08:31:00] <_genuser_> moose but starting to look at some real ones. still a bit out of my range the ones I want.
[08:31:07] <moose> It's about what you like, the process, all of it.
[08:31:33] <moose> Cecen: So, I have property I purchased via NFT for example. This is a tangible item. You can't just clone it and claim ownership.
[08:31:40] <_genuser_> moose obviously a seiko 5 is starting to interest me. It never did. But as I read about it and see, even though it's a cheap watch, an automatic, a classic, it's interesting.
[08:31:51] <moose> I have an NFT deed, in fact.
[08:31:55] <_genuser_> moose so what rolex you got?
[08:32:03] <moose> _genuser_: I have a milgauss
[08:32:24] <_genuser_> moose see I see people saying no only a sub will do or an exlorer. But I also like the milgausses much better.
[08:32:48] <_genuser_> moose very nice. out of my price range, currently, tho.
[08:32:51] <moose> I've had more conversations and comments about it than any other watch.
[08:32:54] <Cecen> What happens if I steal that physical item from you?
[08:33:02] <moose> I think everyone expects an explorer or a datejust or a submariner.
[08:33:05] <Cecen> You have an NFT proving ownership, but it's not physically in your possesion, so what value does it have?
[08:33:37] <moose> Cecen: Which physical item? It's an NFT that is signed to my wallet. If you steal my wallet? Well, it's a bearer item and I'd have to prove it in other ways and go to court if you managed to get it.
[08:33:44] <moose> But you can do the same by physically stealing a deed.
[08:34:10] <moose> I like the idea of an NFT deed, it's more secure really and shows chain of custody and ownership over time.
[08:34:15] <Cecen> Oh, I thought you meant property as in an item, not property as in land
[08:34:16] <moose> It prevents recording errors.
[08:34:24] <moose> Land, yes.
[08:34:26] *** Quits: argoneus (~argoneus@argoneus.com) (Quit: Ping timeout (120 seconds))
[08:34:31] <Cecen> Yes, that is potentially one valid use for NFTs, but imo still all around worse than existing methods
[08:34:33] <moose> I also have my title insurance under the NFT
[08:34:44] <moose> Why? Existing methods are pen and paper in a filing cabinet in an auditor's office.
[08:34:47] <moose> They catch fire often.
[08:34:54] <moose> They get water damaged.
[08:34:57] <moose> Documents are lost and stolen.
[08:34:58] *** Joins: argoneus (~argoneus@argoneus.com)
[08:35:00] <_genuser_> Cecen I was thinking the same originally. The if someone copies off the file, the NFT is useless. But I think the main purpose is to have a publicly available record of ownership.
[08:35:16] <Cecen> Even if you lose a deed, there's a central institution that has recorded your ownership and can enable transactions
[08:35:21] <_genuser_> Cecen and then the rest happens as it does currently. you go to court, you prove you're the owner, etc. etc.
[08:35:25] <Cecen> If you lose your wallet, the deed is effectively lost to the void
[08:35:33] <moose> Cecen: Oh that's what you think! haha
[08:35:40] <moose> I have backups of my wallet private keys, for one.
[08:35:43] <Cecen> Okay
[08:35:45] <Cecen> But what if you don't
[08:35:48] <Cecen> I don't care about you
[08:36:00] <Cecen> Will the average person never lose their wallet?
[08:36:01] <moose> I also know for a fact that if you lose your deed, it is a court process to recover land ownership and will be contested by vultures.
[08:36:07] <_genuser_> but there's gonna come a time, people will be rote memorizing their 12 word phrases (or 24 word phrases)
[08:36:39] <moose> The central office that records stuff, you think magically exist, can sometimes be a drawer in a sheriff's office in rural areas.
[08:37:08] <Cecen> Unless something goes extremely wrong, you can prove your ownership of the land even if you lose the deed and reclaim it.
[08:37:19] <Cecen> There is absolutely no possibility if the deed is an NFT. If you lose your wallet, you're done.
[08:37:20] <moose> Have you ever experienced that process? I have.
[08:37:30] <_genuser_> moose do you trade on coinbase or kraken or multiple? I was thinking of buying SAND but it's only on kraken and I don't have an account there.
[08:37:51] <moose> I have fought quit-claims before and secured properly that was not mine originally, via tax process and court hearings.
[08:38:34] <moose> I've purchased property very inexpensively through quit-claims, and it's hard to fight them. Let me tell you, that's what you get if you lose your deed; the owning entity (a county, the federal government) quit-claims it to you
[08:39:04] <Cecen> You're going completely off the rails. The process isn't fool proof, but it's not 100% lost property like an NFT version is.
[08:39:07] <moose> If you produce a physical verifiable deed for land someone has lived on for 50 years and they only have a quit-claim document, you will win.
[08:39:16] <moose> NFT property isn't lost.
[08:39:20] <moose> The deed is represented as an NFT.
[08:39:21] <Cecen> Also this sounds like it's in the boons
[08:39:21] <moose> It's still recorded.
[08:39:31] <Cecen> Yes, the NFT is in your lost wallet. Without your wallet, you can't do anything with it.
[08:39:40] <moose> It's equivalent to losing the physical deed.
[08:39:46] <moose> There's nothing more risky about it.
[08:39:57] <Cecen> So you're saying someone issues a new NFT representing your lost land
[08:40:01] <moose> No, they can't.
[08:40:06] <moose> Just like you can't get a new deed produced.
[08:40:22] <Cecen> You actually can?
[08:40:26] <Cecen> Are you in some boons country
[08:40:45] <moose> I am going to disengage in this if you keep asking shit like that, it comes off insulting honestly.
[08:40:45] <_genuser_> Cecen are you in the US?
[08:40:48] <Cecen> The county authority can and will issue replacement deeds. Yes
[08:40:56] <moose> I live in the US, I am speaking of US laws.
[08:42:16] <moose> You can get a qualified deed, which is a secondary authoritative source. That's about as good as it gets, and it's still trumped by an actual deed.
[08:42:26] <Cecen> I live in the US. The county registrar is the authority for land ownership. The deed isn't the authoritative proof.
[08:42:44] <Cecen> Unless there's some wild west state where a piece of paper is the authoritative proof of ownership
[08:42:53] <moose> I don't care what your county says, federal law supercedes it.
[08:45:01] <_genuser_> moose so what about SAND or MANA?
[08:45:13] <moose> _genuser_: Never heard of 'em
[08:45:18] <moose> There are so so many lol
[08:45:53] <_genuser_> moose MANA is for decentraland. I guess voting token. SAND is for "The Sandbox". Virtual land game, but also the new "metaverse"
[08:46:12] <moose> Ah, I have been ignoring games mostly due to scams
[08:46:24] <moose> But that seems interesting
[08:46:30] <moose> I will take a peek when I do more digging
[08:46:59] <_genuser_> moose so virtual land is on sale now. Adidas bought a bunch in the sandbox. (snoog dogg is big on the sandbox, might be part investor too, not sure).
[08:47:23] <_genuser_> moose bunch of others are buying up land in the sandbox so they can build virtual malls, or museums, etc. same with decentraland.
[08:47:45] <_genuser_> decentraland has been open already, you can go to their website and view it all via the browser. Very "second life" like.
[08:47:47] <moose> That seems cool, I figured something like this would come about
[08:47:54] <moose> The crypto equivalent of secondlife, coming soon haha
[08:48:09] <_genuser_> moose decentraland is the crypto version of it. It's already open.
[08:48:20] <moose> That's pretty cool, definitely need to take a look then
[08:48:22] <_genuser_> so is the sandbox and few others. some are on solana chain.
[08:49:07] <_genuser_> but those tokens are affordable now. (MANA and SAND). They'll probably hit higher values ones this gets going. The only way to bet on teh network is buy it's token. Sort of how TSLA rallied after SpaceX successfully put people on the ISS
[08:49:56] <Cecen> That entire argument makes zero sense. Without a local recorder, the state can't collect property tax.
[08:51:28] <moose> Cecen: The argument isn't about if a recorder exists.
[08:51:44] <moose> It's not about if they can collect tax. It's about the authoritativeness of the actual document in the recorder/auditor's office
[08:51:44] <Cecen> The recorder existing means that the authoritative proof of ownership isn't your piece of paper
[08:51:52] <moose> That's incorrect.
[08:51:53] <Cecen> If a recorder exists, they can re-issue your deed
[08:51:56] <moose> A common misconception.
[08:52:24] <moose> They can issue a replacement deed known as qualified deed
[08:52:41] <moose> It's not a replacement of the original, it is not as good as the original, but can be used in place of it for SOME transactions.
[08:52:59] <moose> But your title insurance company will charge more to underwrite it
[08:54:09] <moose> 26 USC 6338 specifically states that you must have a certificate of sale AND the deed to sell real property in the United States. In this context, yes the qualified deed can be used. However, if I come up later and challenge your ownership with the original, you WILL lose. There's no question, as it's prima facie evidence of ownership.
[08:55:19] <moose> There are deed/title trolls that find stuff like this and fight people all the time. It sucks for people.
[08:55:29] <moose> That's why if you lose your deed, you are at significant risk even with a replacement.
[08:55:50] <Cecen> So the original deed is in my name. I lose the deed. I replace it with a new deed. How is the old deed, with my name on it, going to be used to contest the replacement deed?
[08:56:16] <moose> Someone forges a certificate of sale and has that deed and gets it amended.
[08:56:22] <Cecen> I think you're going off topic from the original issue, being that using an NFT for a deed makes it unreplacable. We've just established that it can be replaced.
[08:56:24] <moose> Certificate of sale can be any piece of paper.
[08:56:32] <moose> Why would it make it unreplaceable?
[08:56:47] <moose> Just the same as you would get a qualified deed, you can get one if you lose your wallet and your NFT.
[08:56:52] <Cecen> If I lose my wallet, a new NFT needs to be issued to replace it, or I completely lose control over the property
[08:56:58] <moose> No, it doesn't.
[08:57:15] <moose> You can convert your NFT to a paper qualified deed if you don't have possession of the bill of sale or the NFT.
[08:57:26] <Cecen> If a new deed can be issued or a paper deed can be used in place, how is the NFT itself is providing value?
[08:57:49] <moose> Well first off, you can't easily steal an NFT deed.
[08:58:02] <moose> It's far more difficult than stealing a paper one.
[08:58:19] <moose> It also is publicly auditable, meaning I can see precisely and exactly when the property traded hands and it's cryptographically proven.
[08:58:37] <moose> It's less prone to record loss due to fire/flood since it's on a public blockchain
[08:58:47] <Cecen> But you can do that in 98% of the US. I feel like you're in West Virginia or some equally backwards state.
[08:58:51] <moose> Wow.
[08:58:55] <moose> Alright I am done talking to you
[08:58:57] <Cecen> Transactions have to involve the state in the vast majority of the US
[08:59:22] <moose> For what it's worth, I live in Washington State and you're a jackass.

[09:00:27] <moose> Maybe come back and chat when you've actually handled property transactions beyond your primary residence and have actually used NFTs. I am assuming you have done neither, due to the way you speak about both things.
[09:01:42] *** Quits: argoneus (~argoneus@argoneus.com) (Quit: Ping timeout (120 seconds))
[09:03:04] <_genuser_> moose so where do you store the NFTs? ETH wallet?
[09:03:08] <_genuser_> metamask?
[09:03:20] *** Joins: argoneus (~argoneus@argoneus.com)
[09:03:24] <moose> Depends on the thing. Many wallets.
[09:03:31] <moose> For the MIR stuff I am using Terra Station
[09:04:00] <moose> MetaMask is great though too
[09:04:47] <_genuser_> not familiar with MIR stuff.
[09:05:01] <_genuser_> only installed MetaMask recently. Still storing coins on coinbase.
[09:05:19] <moose> The only thing I store on Coinbase is XRP because I can't transact it lol
[09:05:44] <moose> I have a lot of money tied up in it. I hope the things get settled and it booms.
[09:05:47] <_genuser_> not your keys, not your coins stuff?
[09:06:26] <moose> I store my high value coins on offline wallets
[09:06:52] <Cecen> Property transfers are public record in Washington State ???
[09:07:01] <moose> Cecen: They are in every US state.
[09:07:11] <moose> At least, for real property.
[09:07:21] <moose> Land, houses, etc.
[09:07:30] <Cecen> Which I thought. How is someone coming up a forged transfership, that isn't part of the public record, and having it pass?
[09:07:59] <moose> Certificates of sale are often misplaced or not filed appropriately, so you can do some digging and find low hanging fruit pretty easily.
[09:08:00] <_genuser_> moose I'm looking at the hardware wallets like ledger stuff. But I'd figure any wallet where I store off the 12 word phrase is good enough. Such as mobile apps. Create wallet, transfers funds to it. Remember/store the phrase. Done.
[09:08:36] <moose> _genuser_: I mostly worry about my phone or PC getting compromised and losing my key.
[09:09:01] <moose> It's also important to rotate your wallet every 2-4 years depending on your risk tolerance and value stored.
[09:09:17] <moose> It's also good to distribute any high value stuff across multiple keys.
[09:09:41] <_genuser_> I suppose install wallet app, create wallet, send money to it, save off phrase, uninstall app and done.
[09:09:51] <moose> I don't store over $15,000 on a single key. I also use multisig for everything.
[09:10:11] <moose> Ah, I still worry because a wallet app may generate weak keys or your phone could already be compromised.
[09:10:13] <_genuser_> but I totally see the value in not having anything on mobile/pc wallet.
[09:10:25] <_genuser_> moose hmm, good point about phone already being compromised.
[09:10:49] <moose> I would download a wallet and transfer it by USB stick to another machine that is freshly installed and not online at all.
[09:10:58] <_genuser_> moose haven't looked at multisig. So you're using a ledger type offline wallet? Generate a wallet and send coins to that public key? And store the recovery phrase?
[09:11:02] <moose> Then install the wallet after you verify the signatures for the software.
[09:11:13] <_genuser_> ah, I see what you're saying.

[09:11:56] <moose> Also don't use paper and bury it or anything, paper degrades. I use cryptosteel for the seed phrase.
[09:12:22] <moose> I also store that inside of my home safe, not at a bank depository.
[09:12:35] <_genuser_> very nice. I'll look at one of those
[09:12:35] <moose> Easier access, less risk of getting robbed.
[09:13:09] <_genuser_> I know it's easier to forget. But ideal would be to just rote memorize the phrase. and repeat it everyday to keep it fresh.
[09:13:11] <moose> If you ever buy crypto in person, bring a blank wallet and none of your keys with you to receive it :)
[09:13:16] <_genuser_> but you know that that is just not possible.
[09:13:30] <moose> If you don't use it every day, you will forget it. I promise.
[09:13:35] <moose> I've nearly forgotten my safe combination before.
[09:13:49] <moose> Went away for two weeks, and was like UHHHH WHAT WAS THE NUMBER AGAIN
[09:13:52] <_genuser_> nah, never in person. I read about how the IRS was really chasing and harrassing people from localbitcoins stuff.
[09:14:05] <moose> It's fine to do in person transactions
[09:14:32] <moose> But I've had banks close my account before because of large cashouts or what looked like structuring
[09:14:37] <_genuser_> imo, it's fine to do a lot of those transactions. it's the idiots who run teh place who don't udnerstand it. or don't like it.
[09:14:43] <moose> Wells Fargo told me to take my business elsewhere, for example
[09:14:54] <_genuser_> due to withdrawing large amounts of cash?
[09:15:06] <moose> They gave me an anti-money laundering notice and told my account was closed.
[09:15:30] <_genuser_> hmm...
[09:15:33] <moose> Because I had exchanged over $20,000 in an "undisclosed period of days" repeatedly in smaller amounts.
[09:15:45] <moose> It was just normal trading business though with cashouts from small exchanges
[09:16:08] <_genuser_> all this hassle is why I decided to just use coinbase (the oldest well known outfit, and they're already worked with the IRS quite a bit to legitimize crypto).
[09:16:12] <moose> In the US if you transact over $10,000 they get weird and have to report if they think it's suspicious, $20,000 and they are mandated to report it
[09:16:30] <moose> Doesn't matter the source
[09:16:36] <_genuser_> lol wasn't Biden trying to make that $600, because you know billionaires and all.
[09:16:37] <moose> But they sure say crypto is more suspicious in general
[09:16:47] <moose> I didn't hear anything about that
[09:16:50] <moose> $10,000 is already too low IMO
[09:16:53] <moose> Inflation ya know.
[09:17:21] <_genuser_> oh I that was I think recently in the infra bill, that he was trying to add that anybody with $600 in an account or more should be tracked by the bank and reported on.
[09:17:30] <_genuser_> "because rich people don't pay taxes"
[09:17:36] <moose> Oh. That's already a thing. All bank account are tracked.
[09:17:50] <moose> If you have $0 in a random checking account, the government knows about it.
[09:17:51] <_genuser_> they always blame the rich, and then track and penalize the lower middle class and single parent families, lol.
[09:17:57] <moose> Heck, even a private investigator knows about it.
[09:18:05] <moose> There's databases that are accessible by law enforcement and private investigators.
[09:18:23] <moose> Banks have a shared system similar to credit reporting agencies, where they report your balances and your risk.
[09:18:34] <moose> Just, for banking, not credit.
[09:19:02] <_genuser_> all of that is why I figured it would be easier to trade by sending cash from bank to coinbase via wire, coinbase buys cryptos and there's proof. I save off cost-basis. and when I sell it, it would be via coinbase, To keep the entire process documented.
[09:19:20] <moose> Yeah.
[09:19:32] <moose> Coinbase also will give you end of year documents you can hand to your CPA or enter in to turbotax or whatever
[09:19:41] <_genuser_> which I like.
[09:19:42] <moose> It's quite nice
[09:20:01] <_genuser_> I was at one point thinking about going to local bitcoin atm machines and getting btc there.
[09:20:04] <moose> I was using coinbase pro for a while to do lots of small trades, trying to do some day trading
[09:20:07] <_genuser_> then I figure it would be easier to just use coinbase.
[09:20:17] <moose> The ATMs are cool, I think
[09:20:25] <_genuser_> I"ve moved everything to coinbase pro. because of limit orders.
[09:20:31] <moose> I've used them once when I needed cash and thought it would be funny to just use bitcoin
[09:20:47] <moose> Oh yeah, the discounts on non-immediate matches haha
[09:20:56] <moose> It can be one second and boom no fees
[09:21:18] <_genuser_> when I used regular coinbase, it was like 100s of dollars in fees.
[09:21:42] <_genuser_> ETH is said to be getting prohibitive to use due to gas.
[09:22:33] <moose> Yeah the gas cost is crazy
[09:22:54] <_genuser_> they keep saying POS will lower gas prices.
[09:23:15] <_genuser_> but more projects deploying on etherium just doesn't seem like it will be cheaper to run transactions.
[09:23:25] <_genuser_> plus all the NFT transactions too.

[13:19:31] <eurogos> i probably should make it easier by moving back to vs from vscode...
[13:26:23] <jmer> Calling BuildServiceProvider before all services has been registered/added is a mistake, right?
[13:30:22] <eurogos> i do it to get a loggerfactory inside the configureServices
[13:30:31] <eurogos> but it complains at me for doing it
[13:31:18] <jmer> I'm looking into this because FluentMigrator refused to actually do anyting to the database unless I called BuildServiceProvider()
[13:31:59] <MatthiasVance> Basically you're doing something before you're doing something
[13:32:00] <MatthiasVance> :D
[13:32:25] <eurogos> wont it just build whatever it has up top that point?
[13:32:35] <jmer> MatthiasVance: the example of FluentMigrator calls BuildServiceProvider...
[13:32:44] <jmer> I don't get any warnings but I don't like doing stuff I don't understand.
[13:32:54] <MatthiasVance> It builds the service provider

[13:35:57] <planetcalls|work> Nasp, why entire day?
[13:36:06] <planetcalls|work> looks like your CI/CD is crap
[13:36:20] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Ohh it's using a different ServiceCollection from your usual stuff, that is mighty fine
[13:36:47] <jmer> Well I'm re-using the exisiting service collection
[13:36:54] <jmer> I didn't copy the example verbatim :P
[13:37:03] <eurogos> 99% of my issues are because i've done something dumb
[13:37:21] <eurogos> i should write a check list and just go through that each time
[13:38:41] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Boo!
[13:38:50] <jmer> MatthiasVance: why would I want two?
[13:38:52] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Why are you reusing the existing one if you don't need those services?
[13:39:18] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Because they are two separate concerns, one needs a small amount of services to update your DB, the other one is for running your entire application

[13:39:52] <jmer> isn't the whole configuration stuff configured/bound in the service collection?

[13:40:20] *** Joins: scalablecory (~phrosty@c-73-225-175-19.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)
[13:40:26] <eurogos> but it sounds like you need to access a service for something before you've finished building all the services
[13:41:20] <jmer> MatthiasVance: I'm not going to abstract something away just for the sake of abstraction xD
[13:41:38] <MatthiasVance> jmer: That's not the case here.
[13:41:44] <jmer> How do you know?
[13:41:46] <MatthiasVance> Updating the DB before your application starts is a *separate* concern
[13:42:25] <jmer> You might be right but I don't know yet... I'm still not sure how the rollback will affect this
[13:42:34] <jmer> besides, the EF migration stuff was registered in the one ServiceCollection
[13:42:37] <jmer> I see no reason to add a new one
[13:43:20] <MatthiasVance> There is no reason to worry about building the tree twice btw, so that's fine too

[13:44:28] <jmer> From what I read, building it twice might actually waste memory or introduce subtle bugs
[13:44:54] <MatthiasVance> It keeps it in memory? That's dumb
[13:45:06] <MatthiasVance> For subtle bugs, that's why I suggested separating the two. OR find another place to get an instance
[13:45:15] <jmer> in terms of singletons... but I am not sure. I have only used Autofac before, not the build in IoC container
[13:45:25] <jmer> built in*
[13:45:58] <jmer> Besides all these considderations about separation of concerns is kinda useless if I can't get it to work in the simplest of setups
[13:46:18] <jmer> I don't want to create a new ServiceCollection because "it's the only way I can make it work"
[13:49:02] <Nasp> planetcalls|work: Because our pipeline for this monolith is slow, like 30-6o minute between runs, and a success rate of 10-20%
[13:49:14] <Nasp> You rerun it and then it goes through, so i need ro rerun everything a few times to be sure
[13:49:39] <planetcalls|work> that sucks
[13:49:46] <planetcalls|work> Nasp, have you tried building it in parallel?
[13:50:21] <planetcalls|work> if you are using msbuild, you have `/m` as a switch
[13:51:37] <planetcalls|work> also applies for dotnet executable but refer to docs.
[13:52:07] <Nasp> planetcalls|work: It's building in parallel
[13:52:18] <Nasp> It's split up on 5 build agents
[13:52:25] <Nasp> And runs in parallel on each
[13:52:32] <Nasp> But the reruns is what makes it takes forever
[13:52:43] <Nasp> BEcause when you tests are that shaky, when should you trust that it's a real failure or not
[13:52:51] <Nasp> So i run them like 5-8 times before i investigate
[13:57:26] <planetcalls|work> I believe you should ask your managers to find time to address this technical debt then. We had this exercise where we broke this huge monolith repo to smaller micro repos. It has improved the quality of deliverables and the overall delivery time.
[13:57:35] <planetcalls|work> it is something you may want to discuss within team

[15:24:46] <eurogos> debugging experience is balls
[15:25:31] <kobo_> in a jira-board with tasks, if you've finished a task and then during testing phase, things are found to not be working correctly, do you move that card back, or do you create a new task?
[15:26:37] <planetcalls|work> kobo_, always move the task back if it is in testing
[15:26:58] <planetcalls|work> if product is released and then issue is identified, it qualifies as a new bug
[15:27:49] <planetcalls|work> but depends on what convention the team follows.
[15:28:16] <kobo_> right, that sounds reasonable planetcalls|work, but in this case the task is marked as done like 2 sprints back, but as it's a huge feature issues were found just now
[15:28:40] <jmer> if it's done in anohter sprint I would create a new bug
[15:28:47] <jmer> to indicate that extra work was needed.
[15:28:57] <jmer> moving "closed" tasks from older sprints to your current one is a bad practice imho
[15:29:18] <kobo_> yeah thats what I think too.. If it was in the current srint id just move it back, but now it feels more right to be a new task
[15:30:12] <planetcalls|work> kobo_, if a task is closed, it should not be revived. I stated that move the task back only if it is in active testing.
[15:30:20] <jmer> at my former work place QA couldn't finish QA work in a single sprint, so we closed tasks when they were done from a development point of view and then created bugs that rectified whatever was found during QA

[16:13:31] <MaNa2k> do i need to use reflections if i want to do the following?  read enum string, and call a method with same name in that string ?
[16:14:17] <jonp> MaNa2k: not necessarily; you need "a mapping" between the string and the method
[16:14:23] <jonp> Reflection can provide that mapping
[16:14:33] <jonp> or a Dictionary<string, Action> could provide that mapping
[16:14:45] <MaNa2k> hmm, whats that?
[16:14:58] <MaNa2k> i mean i know what a normal dictionary is
[16:15:26] <jonp> `new Dictionary<string, Action> { ["foo"] = () => {â€¦}, ["bar"] = â€¦ }`
[16:15:41] <MaNa2k> what?
[16:15:48] <jonp> Action is a delegate type
[16:15:51] <MaNa2k> where is the method call ?
[16:15:53] <jonp> you could use *any* delegate type
[16:15:55] <MaNa2k> a i see
[16:16:01] <jonp> so you provide a mapping from string to delegate
[16:16:11] <jonp> the *callsite* is a dict lookup: mapping[key]();
[16:16:12] <MaNa2k> i understand
[16:16:14] <MaNa2k> i think
[16:16:34] <jonp> or, safer: if (mapping.TryGetValue(key, out var d)) d();
[16:17:02] <jonp> the benefit to the dict is that it's explicit and faster
[16:17:16] <MaNa2k> mhm
[16:17:18] <MaNa2k> cool
[16:17:20] <jonp> the downside is that it's Yet Another Thing to keep in sync: add a new "enum value", and you need to update the dict
[16:18:46] <MaNa2k> mhm

[16:19:31] <lz_> so I can't have a configuration "x64" in vs for a .net core project? I can select "platform target" but not create a new "platform" in the configuration manager, how do I do this?
[16:20:06] <lz_> see what I mean: https://i.imgur.com/lQBaBYp.png
[16:20:20] <jonp> the dict also allows for names to differ; have `["foo"] = SomeClass.StaticFoo, ["bar"] = AnotherClass.WhatIsBar, â€¦`
[16:20:29] <jonp> could be useful in some compat scenarios
[16:20:41] <jonp> the dict also ensures that your methods have the right parameter signature.
[16:20:45] <jonp> as opposed to blowing up at runtime
[16:22:10] <lz_> I generate my sln using premake and since last vs update I get errors in the config manager as it can't bind "x64" native projects to my .net core libs
[16:22:27] <lz_> I thought I'll fix it by creating platforms of the same name but apparently I can't? :(
[16:23:13] <lz_> guess I'll have to write my own sln generator :(

[19:12:46] <teut> in simple words
[19:13:15] <pandem> wpf is desktop, xamarin mainly mobile
[19:13:24] <teut> I open VS 19 and there are so many options. I just want to create a cross platform mobile app.
[19:13:40] <pandem> then you probably want xamarin
[19:13:51] <pandem> although i'm not sure if .net is the best solution for that
[19:14:01] <teut> means what?
[19:14:10] <pandem> or maybe maui, not sure how that one is going
[19:14:17] <teut> should I use java?
[19:14:33] <pandem> idk, there's so many different options
[19:15:10] <teut> whats the problem in using c#? If you see youtube they will just tell the merits of Xamarin on how its cross platform
[19:15:19] <pandem> xamarin, native, react native, flutter, nativescript, cordova, ionic etc
[19:15:28] <teut> I know python, c++, js, java.

[19:22:29] <pandem> i guess you can

[19:22:43] <pandem> isn't there also like two different xamarins
[19:23:47] <teut> I just saw a microsoft video on introduction to xamarin. But I know they just talk all good about a framework without telling problems relted to the framework.
[19:24:12] <pandem> xamarin is going to die next year i think

[19:24:26] <teut> oh
[19:27:01] <teut> both c# and java are suddenly on fire
[19:27:59] <pandem> i don't think mobile dev is one of c#s strengths
[19:28:20] <teut> is react native better?
[19:28:31] <teut> I heard it lacks many mobile apis
[19:28:45] <teut> and also it's only for win 11
[19:28:54] <MatthiasVance> pandem: Why is that?
[19:28:58] <pandem> i think xamarin and react native share some of the issues
[19:29:07] <pandem> idk, that's just my impression
[19:29:14] <teut> i should stick with java then
[19:29:15] <pandem> but i'm not a mobile dev really so

[19:44:37] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: and what graphics lib? i thought maui was just a platform abstraction
[19:44:46] <MatthiasVance> Usually with mobile development (with Xamarin) you had to put images in a specific format in the specific projects for each platform
[19:45:16] <MatthiasVance> So it's not a *code* library that you reuse to do cross-platform graphics (well, I guess also a bit xD)
[19:45:35] <MatthiasVance> O wait I didn't even read
[19:45:43] <MatthiasVance> I was so happy that I had a unified way of managing *images*

[20:14:10] <JakeSays> that could've been achieved w/o adding records
[20:14:32] <JakeSays> a simple type modifier would've been enough
[20:15:22] <DevJohnC> sure, it's not like records are a bad solution to that and it adds more features at the same time so whatever
[20:15:39] <jonp> JakeSays: `record` *is* a "type modifier" :-)
[20:16:01] <JakeSays> jonp: what do you mean
[20:16:10] <jonp> what do *you* mean by "type modifier"?
[20:16:24] <jonp> if you mean like "partial" or "sealed", then `record` is kinda/sorta a type modifier
[20:16:31] <JakeSays> public/sealed/abstract are modifiers
[20:16:40] <jonp> it's still a `class`; it's still a reference type, can still be a base class, etc.
[20:17:06] <DevJohnC> can still be base class for other record types
[20:17:16] <DevJohnC> you can't base a class on a record
[20:17:19] <jonp> which is why it's handy that it isn't a `class`
[20:17:21] <JakeSays> right, so why the new syntax?
[20:17:45] <DevJohnC> because of things like positional parameters and the with syntax for creating mutated copies

[20:18:58] <JakeSays> brianonymous: pretend like they're immutable classes
[20:19:16] <DevJohnC> I don't think the syntax would be as cleanly distinct if you used, say, `public record class MyRecord(....);`, the one-liner syntax would conflict with the `class` keyword in my perception
[20:19:33] <brianonymous> is that immutable even if passed in references?
[20:19:39] <jonp> ?
[20:19:48] <DevJohnC> brianonymous: no, you can mutate reference types being held by the record
[20:19:58] <JakeSays> DevJohnC: well, i would use immutable instead of record for the modifier
[20:20:06] <brianonymous> so is it just a heapy struct?
[20:20:15] <DevJohnC> JakeSays, we have a keyword for that already, `readonly`
[20:20:20] <JakeSays> brianonymous: a class with get only properties
[20:20:23] <brianonymous> oh
[20:20:28] <brianonymous> i see
[20:20:45] <JakeSays> DevJohnC: huh?
[20:21:06] <DevJohnC> you can mark properties and type declarations as readonly

[20:22:20] <JakeSays> but yeah, class readonly Foo would've been enough

[20:22:40] <brianonymous> i think thats what confuses me the most
[20:22:47] <DevJohnC> readonly class might have been enough for immutability, but records added more than that

[20:25:34] <JakeSays> i dont. all of that could've easily been added to class.
[20:25:56] <DevJohnC> "could have" != "should have"
[20:26:12] <JakeSays> in this case it does
[20:26:29] <jonp> agree to disagree?
[20:26:32] <DevJohnC> I like that they're distinct, it allows them to occupy different spaces in my mind and keep things clearer and easier to read/write
[20:26:46] <jonp> records also implement Equals & GetHashCode() & other behaviors.
[20:26:54] <jonp> in ways *not* "overridable" by the dev
[20:26:59] <DevJohnC> jonp, you don't understand, if I walk away from this I have to go back to Xcode
[20:27:03] <jonp> if it were a `class`, things would get weird.
[20:27:24] <JakeSays> DevJohnC: xcode is your punishment for disagreeing with me
[20:27:27] <DevJohnC> I thought all that behavior was able to customized
[20:27:59] <JakeSays> jonp: so equals and gethashcode can't be overridden?
[20:28:15] <jonp> *you* can't provide them in a `record`
[20:28:20] <jonp> they're provided by the compiler
[20:28:29] <JakeSays> so they can't be overridden
[20:28:37] <JakeSays> which i *definitely* don't like
[20:28:46] <jonp> depends on what you mean by "override"â€¦
[20:29:27] <JakeSays> seriously? you know exactly what i mean.
[20:30:10] <jonp> the method is there; it's a method override at the IL level, and if you subclass a record the compiler will further override the method.
[20:30:19] <jonp> in terms of virtual dispatch, it's overridden; it exists.
[20:30:25] <jonp> it's just that YOU aren't involved.
[20:30:41] <JakeSays> jonp: which means it can't be overridden.
[20:30:49] <DevJohnC> from the MS docs: "You can declare your own version of any of the compiler-synthesized methods in a record type except the clone method."
[20:30:55] <JakeSays> which is a huge fail for me

[20:32:43] * brianonymous prints his member
[20:32:48] <JakeSays> _genuser_: not much. you?
[20:32:52] <DevJohnC> You can declare your own version of any of the compiler-synthesized methods in a record type except the clone method. The clone method has a compiler-generated name and you can't provide a different implementation. These synthesized methods include a copy constructor, the members of the System.IEquatable<T> interface, equality and inequality tests,
[20:32:53] <DevJohnC> and GetHashCode(). For this purpose, you'll synthesize PrintMembers.

[23:00:37] <ki9a> Did you ever read something about some swift interop support in .net core?
[23:01:09] <JakeSays> ki9a: that's just evil
[23:01:23] <ki9a> swift is one of those horrible pieces of crap
[23:01:34] <ki9a> which has no docs but "hey, to talk to us, the compiler output is the spec"
[23:01:51] <JakeSays> nice
[23:01:52] <Suchiman> ki9a: yeah i think they are / were working on it for the xamarin unification
[23:02:00] <ki9a> but it's also the future api of ios/osx
[23:03:54] <Suchiman> ki9a: is it different from obj-c? https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/44659
[23:04:25] <ki9a> yes
[23:10:08] <ki9a> objc is basically c
[23:10:20] <ki9a> but pushing all call through objc_msgSend
[23:11:00] <ki9a> (and objects are reference counted by calling release/retain on the instances (again through msgSend)
[23:13:05] <ki9a> Swift has it's own calling convention
[23:13:37] <JakeSays> it will Swift'ly drive you mad
[23:16:07] <tlf> do you see what he did there?
[23:16:29] <tlf> he didn't have to, but he threw caution to the wind
[23:21:21] <Flonk> What's the fastest way to get an ILogger<T> that does nothing or something else, if I just want to roll one-of scripts for testing?
[23:21:55] <Flonk> Like I could set up HostBuilder but that takes 10 minutes and I'd rather google 30 minutes to find out if theres another way.
