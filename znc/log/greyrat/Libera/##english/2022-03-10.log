[00:14:10] <ash_worksi> here I go again :\
[00:14:43] <ash_worksi> so I am writing feature files for OAuth2 in terms of movie tickets and valet parking tickets in hopes that I can translate them after

[00:15:18] <ash_worksi> but something I don't really have an "OAuth spec" word for is "Ticket" (ie Movie Ticket)
[00:15:31] <ash_worksi> naturally you might think "Token" is applicable, but really thats a "Stub"
[00:15:51] <ash_worksi> so my question is, "Stub" is to "Token" as "Ticket" is to what?

[00:21:31] <huf> the ticket is the thing
[00:22:13] <huf> but really, why do this
[00:22:32] <huf> oauth2 is not that hard, but it doesnt need an extra layer of difficulty on top

[05:55:19] * Sunrise smiles
[05:55:35] <Sunrise> i have a question about sending emails - an email 'chain'
[05:55:58] <Sunrise> basically: i send you an email with a legal request, you who are an emplyee of an agency delete the mail and send something different to your boss asking if they will do something I never asked for, and you send replies to me without that initial email at all. 
[05:56:35] <Sunrise> i know it's a rule in some businesses that the chain remain unbroken and unaltered, but is it law?
[05:56:55] <Sunrise> and if it might be law, are there key words to describe the thing?
[05:57:32] <Sunrise> 'email chain' seems to bring up 'chain letters' and 'chain mail'(as in knight)
[06:00:34] <twb> Sunrise: "thread" is usually the term for email
[06:06:16] <Sunrise> twb, thanks so much
[06:06:24] <Sunrise> someone said 'paper trail'
[06:06:41] <twb> Sunrise: that is internally "Message-ID" and "In-Reply-To"
[06:06:48] <twb> oh and "References"
[06:08:17] <Sunrise>     1. A series of documents providing evidence of one's actions.
[06:08:17] <Sunrise>    2. A written record, history, or collection of evidence.
[06:08:17] <Sunrise>    3. the records left by a person or organization in the course of activities.
[06:08:17] <Sunrise> The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, 5th Edition.
[06:09:30] <Sunrise> which brings to 'chain of evidence'
[06:09:41] <Sunrise> which is clearly broken by this action
[06:14:46] <twb> Sunrise: yes "chain of custody", "chain of evidence", "paper trail", "audit trail" are related concepts
[06:19:12] <Sunrise> indeed! thank you :)

[08:42:05] <malloy> hello, when i want to emphsis something, i know to add DO before it, such as i DO eat an apple, but should i say 'i am do happy.'?
[08:43:02] <katsuragi> "i am do happy" is incorrect
[08:43:50] <katsuragi> happy is not a verb
[08:46:48] <katsuragi> you may say: "i love being happy"
[09:06:51] <twb> malloy: "emphasize"
[09:07:38] <twb> malloy: your example "I *do* eat an apple" makes sense, but you are over-extending that pattern.
[09:07:59] <malloy> katsuragi: thant's not the same with the orginal
[09:08:20] <twb> the "do" there is by contrast with "do not".  It's an auxiliary verb.
[09:08:40] <twb> But you can't use that with "to be" in "I am happy"
[09:09:23] <twb> You could change "I enjoy X" to "I *do* enjoy X", I suppose.
[09:10:41] <katsuragi> I wouldn't suggest using "do" like that even though it's correct

[10:40:01] <Me-me> So while looking up the spelling of "simoleon", a slang term for a unit of money, I found out that Sirocco, a literal actual nation, adopted it as their official currency, directly from the SimCity series of video games. They use the section symbol (§) just like the games do, too.

[10:41:14] <ln> Waiting.
