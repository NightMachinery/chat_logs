[00:31:17] <relipse> is there some unwritten rule that resume's should only be one page?
[00:31:40] <Sammitch> lol no
[00:31:54] <__adrian> but they should be focused
[00:31:56] <relipse> there is no way i can keep it that short
[00:32:41] <__adrian> e.g., don't talk about mcdonald's when you're applying to be a business analyst
[00:32:48] <__adrian> plus your cover letter
[00:32:54] <relipse> haha i already made that mistake
[00:32:58] <Sammitch> but depending on how much actual career experience you have you might want to shorten some of your earlier work descriptions, and at some point drop unrelated things like working at the donut store in college
[00:33:06] <__adrian> ^
[00:33:10] <relipse> i litereally listed my mcdonalds employment when applying for a php job
[00:33:55] <relipse> where can I find a nice cover letter template?
[00:34:04] <__adrian> yeah, forget about it. you might have a job from another industry that's relevant, but if not, don't mention it except to explain that you weren't unemployed
[00:34:31] <Sammitch> I would say that you would only need to include that if your resume is a bit thin to begin with, and you want to show that you've at least had steady employment for a given period of time
[00:34:43] <__adrian> yeah
[00:37:42] <Sammitch> I usually have a "master" copy of my resume with all the things on it, and then I'll pare down a copy tailored to what I'm applying to, tack on a cover letter, and save the thing under a dated filename that includes who I applied to.
[00:38:16] <Sammitch> just make sure when you copy/paste your cover letter that you change the name of the employer <_<;;;;

[01:41:27] <Byteflux> And yeah I've thought about that too, but I haven't found a good library to export HTML/CSS to PDF.
[01:41:32] <biberu> Byteflux: latex!
[01:41:41] <Byteflux> But you might have some luck just generating the PDF directly
[01:42:01] <Byteflux> I mean building your resume in a PDF library.
[01:42:06] <Byteflux> Oh or yeah, latex too maybe :)
[01:43:15] <biberu> yeah, you can generate pdf from that, it's what I'm doing with my resume
[01:43:53] <Byteflux> I'm not familiar with it but have heard enough about it to know that you can do that. But what kind of styling can you do with it?
[01:44:41] <Byteflux> Can you mix fonts and will it embed those fonts into the PDF?
[01:45:21] <biberu> yes
[01:47:24] <biberu> there's a threshold though, so if you're curious you should be prepared to spend some time learning it
[01:48:19] <Byteflux> I was considering just using YAML or something and then vomiting out a PDF with some library :P
[01:48:41] <Byteflux> But seems like I'd probably just be reinventing LaTeX
[01:48:50] <Byteflux> So might learn it
[01:49:45] <Byteflux> Currently using Google Docs... a real pain in the ass. I got 6 different relevant jobs over 15 years squeezed onto one page. Using the bare minimum acceptable font size and 0.5 inch margins >_>
[01:51:52] <Albright> Just go to two pages and be happy.
[01:52:46] <Byteflux> Nah I don't really have to yet. If I actually need the space I can just get rid of the small column of side info
[01:53:06] <Byteflux> Or find a better way to present that column, rather.

[05:05:04] <Exile> Heyo
[05:06:18] <Exile> I'm gonna just ask, I guess..... I'm having a session issue with php I've written and literally cannot figure out what is wrong. Would anyone be willing to take a look?
[05:07:55] <__adrian> explain your situation and what you've figured out so far
[05:16:09] <Exile> Sure, its a simple site I'm in the process of writing for friends only, where we can watch tv, youtube, etc together ad-free. I've not even gotten that far as I'm trying to set up Authentication. Session's are setting, but not carrying over to other pages, and, even on its current page, that session cannot be destroyed as it thinks there are no sessions. I can post and get without issue.
[05:17:10] <__adrian> so narrow it down to the immediate problem - forget all the other stuff, look at the sessions. did you check that your browser is accepting the session cookie?
[05:18:39] <Exile> I have, and according to the requests it sends, some pages recieve the request, others dont yet somehow also don't have the session. Clearing and resetting the cookie(s) also does nothing in the way of resolving the issue. Running latest chrome on default settings, in a local testing environment.
[05:19:45] <__adrian> sorry, just to clarify: you're inspecting the requests you're making (e.g., via dev tools) and it *does include* a Cookie header with the phpsessid?
[05:19:56] <Exile> Yes.
[05:20:07] <__adrian> how do you determine that sessions "aren't working"?
[05:21:00] <Exile> Currently, I can access some pages via that session as normal which are running under almost identical code to the rest. Other pages immediately redirect to login. On pages where I've disabled the redirect, it tells me that, for example, $_SESSION['userid'] is null.
[05:21:36] <Exile> I'm fully willing to provide screenshots if they're welcome here.
[05:22:30] <__adrian> ok, so remove the redirects from the question - instead, look at the session itself. e.g., log in and then request this page:  <?php session_start(); echo session_status();
[05:22:34] <__adrian> what's it show?
[05:22:44] <Exile> I'll check, give me a moment please.
[05:23:02] <__adrian> (you could also put that at the top of (any) other pages; just follow with  exit;)
[05:23:45] <Exile> Just "2"
[05:24:23] <__adrian> that's  PHP_SESSION_ACTIVE
[05:24:29] <__adrian> your session is working correctly
[05:24:53] <__adrian> maybe add something like  var_dump($_SESSION);  and see if it contains what you expect
[05:24:54] <Exile> Ok that solves that mystery, but then why are $_SESSION variables I set not remaining set?
[05:25:02] <Exile> Ok one sec
[05:25:28] <__adrian> dunno. might depend on your code  ;)  how complicated tdid you make your session management?
[05:25:40] <Exile> It doesn't. "array(0) {}"
[05:26:06] <__adrian> did you session_start() at every entry point? do you session_destroy()? do you try to set options, etc.?
[05:26:28] <__adrian> that means it's an empty array (you've got no values in your session)
[05:27:07] <Exile> I session destroy on user log out and page refresh at this moment, session start occurs on each page as the very first php line. The required variables are set via "authme.php" upon successful authentication.
[05:27:15] <__adrian> try   echo session_id();  across a few pages (only one login) and see if they're the same.

[05:27:26] <Exile> Will do, one moment please.
[05:27:35] <__adrian> > I session destroy on ... page refresh at this moment   // ?
[05:28:15] <__adrian> maybe you mean somehting else, but if that's literally what you mean, sounds like the problem
[05:29:01] <Exile> I meant it differently yes, sorry. Basically theres a logout button that when pressed destroys the session and reloads the page, which is intended to immediately redirect to login because there is no longer an active auth.
[05:29:02] <__adrian> in most cases, i would only expect session_destroy() in one place - on logout.
[05:29:30] <Exile> Tried "echo session_id()" on 3 different pages, all were problem pages except the first one, all 3 returned the same value.
[05:30:33] *** Quits: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm) (Quit: "")
[05:30:35] <__adrian> seems like maybe you're not setting the values you think you are. do you have an example?
[05:30:47] <Exile> I can hastebin some of the code, yeah.
[05:31:57] <Exile> https://hastebin.com/tiyowemeco.php <-- This is "authme.php"
[05:32:17] <Exile> The include pulling "sql.php" is only variables containing MySQL database information.
[05:33:07] <Exile> Authme is what is sent a POST request containing the users hashed password and username on login. I have confirmed that authentication itself works.
[05:33:45] <__adrian> aside: ALWAYS USE prepared statements and pass data via parameters. do not use escaping and DO NOT put $variables in your sql.
[05:34:07] <__adrian> have you verified that those conditions you expect are met?
[05:34:28] <Exile> Noted, I appreciate it. To be entirely clear, it ONLY contains variables required for connecting to the Database at this moment and is only intended to be used during development.
[05:34:35] <Exile> And define "conditions"?
[05:34:45] *** Joins: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm)
[05:35:08] <__adrian> e.g., you only set "userid" if password_verfy() is true
[05:35:14] <Exile> Correct.
[05:35:51] <Exile> I confirmed this previously using echo. If the password hash does not match, it skips over it entirely and redirects with a URI variable of "err=login"
[05:35:59] <__adrian> (and "it's only for dev" isn't valid - why waste time doing dev wrong so you have to redo it for prod?)
[05:36:35] <__adrian> try skipping the redirects and var_dump($_SESSION) instead
[05:36:35] <Exile> Tbh at the time I didn't expect this to be a thing I was going to use in a production environment. It's only at the request of some friends that I am making it as such. sql.php will be removed in the future.
[05:36:48] <Exile> Will do, one moment please.
[05:37:50] <__adrian> aside,aside:  isset($_POST['btn_submit'])  // this doesn't mean "InputUser" and "inputPasswd" are also set.
[05:38:19] <Exile> I know, appreciated nonetheless.
[05:38:38] <Exile> Also, attempting to var_dump with authme.php rather then redirecting has resulted in a 503
[05:38:59] <__adrian> wild guess: you made a syntax error somehow
[05:39:31] <Exile> "var_dump($_SESSION);", correct?
[05:39:43] <__adrian> yes
[05:40:15] <__adrian> php -l that/file.php
[05:40:32] <Exile> The only time this page redirects to a 503 is when MySQL has encountered an error. Give me a moment and I'll do that
[05:41:06] <__adrian> k
[05:41:18] <Exile> No syntax errors detected.
[05:41:48] <__adrian> so maybe your db, as you said, otherwise... no idea
[05:41:51] <Exile> Also, 503 is only called directly by the page when a database connection has errored.
[05:42:05] <__adrian> oh
[05:42:16] <__adrian> you're being redirected to your 503 page
[05:42:20] <Exile> Correct.
[05:42:25] <__adrian> (not actually getting a 503 response?)
[05:42:28] <__adrian> ok
[05:42:35] <__adrian> i would guess it's your db then  :)
[05:43:05] <Exile> Let me check to see if its actually the page sending it there, or if its actually 503ing
[05:44:27] <Exile> It was the page redirecting, and to be honest I don't know why. var_dump succeeded, it IS defining the variables correctly.
[05:44:48] <Exile> "["userid"]=> string(5) "Exile" ["IS_ADMIN"]=> bool(true) } array(3) { ["ERROR"]=> string(0) "" ["userid"]=> string(5) "Exile" ["IS_ADMIN"]=> bool(true)"
[05:44:53] <__adrian> so restore the redirects; var_dump() on the page you're redirected to
[05:45:04] <Exile> One moment
[05:46:06] <Exile> "2array(3) { ["ERROR"]=> string(0) "" ["userid"]=> string(5) "Exile" ["IS_ADMIN"]=> bool(true) } 63oph7p2vuhsfbdo7lp0v140pr"
[05:46:49] <__adrian> assuming the part at the end is the session_id()
[05:46:54] <Exile> Correct.
[05:46:56] <__adrian> so looks like this much is working
[05:47:11] <__adrian> you're gonna have to continue on like this and find where it breaks
[05:47:21] <Exile> So at this point it raises the question as to if its there, and php says its there, why is it this page doesn't see it there
[05:47:27] <__adrian> mm hm
[05:47:30] <Exile> Like I can call that variable all I want
[05:47:32] <Exile> It doesnt see it
[05:47:39] <__adrian> find a place it breaks, and var_dump() there
[05:47:49] <Exile> I'll work on that. Thank you.
[05:47:53] <__adrian> np
[05:48:53] <__adrian> (you can also log instead of using echo/var_dump. this can be more convenient, less intrusive, and the info doesn't disappear when you close the browser.)
[05:50:14] <Exile> I appreciate it. At this point, I know for a fact that *something* is clearing the session on refresh. After uncommenting the exit line, I refreshed with the other lines in place. array (2) {} again. I need to figure out what. Would a session_destroy do this?\
[05:50:29] <Exile> array (0) *
[05:50:37] <__adrian> yes
[05:50:51] <__adrian> session_destroy() ...destroys the session  :)
[05:51:01] <Exile> Right, I just didn't know it kept the same session identifier.
[05:51:08] <__adrian> it doesn't
[05:51:14] <Exile> *but why is it staying the same*
[05:51:38] <Exile> I found it
[05:51:43] <__adrian> implies something else is happening
[05:52:12] <Exile> It was a button, which was supposed to run session_destroy and refresh at the same time. The php within that button contained session_destroy, which was running immediately.
[05:52:39] <__adrian> not sure what you mean by that  and/or  what you expected to happen
[05:53:24] <Exile> So basically, the log out button had "<?php session_destroy(); ?>" within it. I thought this would only run on button press. I was wrong.
[05:53:44] <__adrian> ...i see
[05:53:55] <Exile> What is the best way to have a log out button destroy the session?
[05:54:17] <__adrian> remember, php happens on the server. there's no button. there's no webpage. all that happens later, AFTER php is done and ded.
[05:54:36] <__adrian> make the button link to your logout page
[05:54:57] <Exile> I had never even thought about that. Can the log out page simply be a session_destroy and redirect?
[05:55:03] <__adrian> yes
[05:55:08] <Exile> Amazing
[05:55:15] <Exile> You sir, are actually my hero today
[05:55:16] <Exile> Thank you
[05:55:18] <Exile> Seriously
[05:55:26] <__adrian> np
[05:55:37] <__adrian> if you're not too far along, there's another suggestion i'd offer
[05:56:02] <Exile> I'm not all that far along, no. Auth was step 4 of like 18
[05:56:05] <__adrian> you're making a website by making a "collection of webpages." a bunch of separate php scripts all on the same site.
[05:56:19] <Exile> Right
[05:56:23] <__adrian> instead, make a _single point of entry_.
[05:56:35] <Exile> Like a single file, which does everything?
[05:56:44] <__adrian> a single file which _starts_ everything
[05:57:05] <__adrian> make all requests go to your (e.g.)  main.php script. thats cript would do your setup work (e.g., your session), decide which page to show, then load that content.
[05:57:35] <Exile> Gotcha. Would I just do that with functions? Like how would I tell that main PHP file what to run?
[05:58:01] <__adrian> are you asking about the routing part (choosing which page to show)?
[05:58:05] <Exile> Yeah
[05:58:13] <Exile> Post requests maybe?
[05:58:44] <__adrian> so the absolute simplest approach would be like   $pages = ["/"=>"home.php", "/contact"=>"contact.php", etc...]
[05:59:26] <__adrian> then you'd do  $page = $pages[$_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]] ?? "not-found.php";  require $page;
[05:59:44] <Exile> Makes sense. Thank you again
[06:01:33] <__adrian> that's really simplistic, but it's the idea.  better yet would be to use an existing framework to handle it. e.g., look at slim/silex/lumen/laminas/etc.
[06:01:51] <__adrian> don't think you have to build everything yourself from scratch. that's a harmful mindset
[06:02:17] <Exile> Fair
[06:03:02] <Exile> Most of this is going to be JavaScript reliant, as that's what I know. But I can't just do Authentication in javascript without either exposing all of it to the internet or writing a NodeJS backend, which would've been far more effort then its worth
[06:09:57] <__adrian> you thought that far, so your ahead of the game :)

[07:54:19] <guy_frm_yogaland> I need some help with datetimes in php
[07:55:05] <guy_frm_yogaland> I need to define the constructor for a class and pass it the timestamp in it, I don't know how to do it
[07:57:15] <Rockwood> https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.datetime.php its help you i think
[07:57:47] <Rockwood> how do you planning for pass datetime?
[07:58:04] <Rockwood> i means as params?
[07:58:31] <guy_frm_yogaland> as the javascript format for the frontend
[08:00:08] <guy_frm_yogaland> something like this: 2004-02-12T15:19:21+00:00
[08:00:31] <Rockwood> i means server current time?
[08:00:59] <Rockwood> or you want to inject any other time
[08:02:09] <Rockwood> please give us more detail
[08:02:14] <guy_frm_yogaland> actually, I want to create json data and that is why using jsonSerialize() and it would go to the frontend
[08:02:48] <Rockwood> that is new thing you just info me
[08:02:49] <guy_frm_yogaland> but currently I have defined the updatedtime and createdtime as strings
[08:03:24] <guy_frm_yogaland> anyways, thanks

[13:22:23] <guy_frm_yogaland> so, I am not using a database for the slim backend app, rather I am using a json file, for fetching and saving my data. I have already written the data as json format, now, how to access the file and read all the data and send that data as a format for javascript frontend
[13:22:25] <guy_frm_yogaland> ?
[13:24:24] <biberu> guy_frm_yogaland: flat files may be harder to get right than you think, why aren't you using a database?
[13:25:24] <AllenJB> file_get_contents() will get you the entire contents of a file. If you want to do any processing / filtering on it, either find a library to do that, or just json_decode() it and filter the resulting (I assume) array
[13:25:33] <guy_frm_yogaland> it's just what my boss demanded to only use json
[13:25:43] <biberu> what? for persistence or transport?
[13:25:52] <guy_frm_yogaland> persistence
[13:26:13] <biberu> at least save the json in a database? :D
[13:26:22] <AllenJB> You may want to look at sqlite, which doesn't require a DB server.
[13:26:23] <guy_frm_yogaland> json_encode() for saving the data on to the json file
[13:26:54] <AllenJB> Personally I would only use flat-files in very simple cases where writes are very rare.
[13:27:04] <biberu> guy_frm_yogaland: how are you handling locking, concurrent access, indexing etc etc?
[13:27:12] <guy_frm_yogaland> no
[13:27:20] <biberu> you are not handling it?
[13:27:24] <guy_frm_yogaland> i am just new to php and slim
[13:27:49] <guy_frm_yogaland> I am kind of handling routing, sessions, login auth, api, etc
[13:28:14] <guy_frm_yogaland> for the api, I need to do all the transactions with json to the frontend vue app

[14:07:10] <biberu> could be static or not

[14:14:20] <biberu> no_gravity: for curiosity's sake: https://3v4l.org/YRKXd
[14:14:23] <TinoDidriksen> What terrible abuse of the type system. You shouldn't do that in Python either.
[14:14:28] <biberu> would not do this
[14:14:29] <biberu> indeed
[14:15:13] <biberu> it's all sorts of terrible
[14:15:42] <biberu> and it's not about how it looks in php, it's about what it's *doing* in your python example
[14:16:09] <no_gravity> biberu: The difference is that here the class is cooperative. You do not really change a class method.
[14:16:43] <biberu> why do you want to do this?
[14:16:53] <no_gravity> I did not say I want to do it.
[14:17:08] <biberu> that is true, but i assume there is some context to the question?
[14:17:15] <no_gravity> I just learned about how Python classes work and was surprised you can change methods at runtime.
[14:17:19] <biberu> or perhaps you just want to point out that python is crazy?
[14:17:21] <TinoDidriksen> Changing a type after it's been defined is wrong in many ways.
[14:17:22] <no_gravity> So I am comparing it at other languages.
[14:17:57] <no_gravity> Well, there is some logic to it. It seems in Python, classes are just objects that get copied on instantiation.
[14:18:39] <no_gravity> Similar to how you use functions in Javascript to emulate classes.
[14:18:51] <TinoDidriksen> So it doesn't even affect already defined objects of that type? That's even worse.
[14:19:12] <biberu> javascript has classes
[14:19:28] <TinoDidriksen> JS lets you append functions to types, and all objects of that type gets them.
[14:19:30] <no_gravity> TinoDidriksen: It does if the already defined objects did not redifine the method themselfes.
[14:19:45] <no_gravity> biberu: JS classes are just syntactic sugar on functions I think.
[14:20:12] <TinoDidriksen> They were, long ago.
[14:22:10] <no_gravity> Languages. They grow up so fast these days.

[16:50:43] <__adrian> it's stupid.
[16:51:24] <__adrian> re: php: no, don't try to modify classes/object structures at runtime. that's not how it works and there's zero benefit.
[16:51:41] <__adrian> what's the actual problem to be solved, here?
[16:51:57] <biberu> he left, i think he was just playing around
[16:51:58] <__adrian> maybe you want a strategy pattern?
[16:52:01] <__adrian> mm
[16:55:04] <biberu> so, what's the deal with classes then? :)
[16:58:08] <Blondie101010> well JS class support is not too bad nowadays....  better than prototyping imo
[17:02:05] <biberu> __adrian: is there something in particular you consider missing for them to be "classes"?
[17:03:01] <biberu> just curious about what you were thinking about, i guess it's something more than might compile to functions and prototypes?

[17:09:10] <__adrian> they're just not classes at all. they're sugar. javascript doesn't have classes; they have prototypes.
[17:10:07] <biberu> does that matter?
[17:10:19] <__adrian> ...why wouldn't it matter?
[17:10:47] <__adrian> i mean from a mile high, is it ok to use js classes even though they're not really classes? sure, it's fine
[17:10:50] <biberu> if you can declare and use it like a class, what does it matter what it is in the background?
[17:12:27] <__adrian> it's the same problem of trying to add methods to a class/object in php. yes, you can do something that kinda looks like that, but it's not what you're actually doing. you're adding jank for no good reason.
[17:13:04] <biberu> i mean, you don't have to monkey patch them
[17:13:09] <__adrian> if you want to write js, you need to understand prototypes. there is _no classical inheritance_ in js, period. don't pretend there is. it'll screw you over eventually.
[17:14:04] <__adrian> if you like the sugar, that's fine. but if you think it means js works like other classical languages, you're in a bad spot.
[17:15:45] <biberu> i don't think that, and i use inheritance *very* conservatively, was merely curious what you consider missing for them to be called "classes", but i guess classical inheritance is one such thing then?
[17:16:08] <__adrian> classical objects
[17:16:23] <__adrian> js is a prototypal language.
[17:17:33] <biberu> i guess you'll just need another word for class in the js world then :)
[17:18:07] * __adrian shrugs
[17:18:12] <__adrian> describes the intent
[17:18:32] <biberu> exactly
[17:18:53] <__adrian> i just see it as dumb, as it's a purely marketing feature. they wanted to make the people who complain about prototypes love them
[17:19:13] <__adrian> _intent_, not the actual state of things.
[17:19:34] <__adrian> js classes don't work like classes. and they don't make objects that work like classical objects.
[17:19:37] <biberu> i don't know about what they might have intended, but it's less clutter to type and read
[17:19:43] *** Parts: [twisti] (~twisti@toadwater.com) ()
[17:19:49] <biberu> ofc you need to know the language ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:19:55] <__adrian> the intent was to silence critics that complained they don't have classes
[17:20:34] <__adrian> it was actually discussed. they wanted to be more "accessible" to folks that didn't understand how prototypes work and refused to learn.
[17:21:16] <__adrian> it's no more "wrong" than calling anon functions in php, "clousures"

[18:53:33] <__adrian> php has nothing to do with git.
[18:53:38] <burrows> i know
[18:53:45] <burrows> but is it possible in php?
[18:53:59] <__adrian> sorry, but that's the answer
[18:54:01] <__adrian> php is not git
[18:54:17] <__adrian> you might find some php library that gives you programatic access to git
[18:54:24] <__adrian> BUT that's not what you think it is
[18:54:33] <Robdgreat> deep down it's likely to still be using system() or similar
[18:54:56] <burrows> i guess i could access ~/projects/foo/.git/config from within php
[18:54:57] <__adrian> e.g., if someone copied your code, but didn't have git installed (or changed the remotes) then it would just be nonsense
[18:55:07] <TinoDidriksen> There are no maintained git extensions for PHP.

[18:55:46] <__adrian> in the end: "where is this code on github?" is NOT a question your php code should be able to answer. that's a wrong idea.
[18:56:34] <burrows> in the "about" section
[18:56:38] <__adrian> it has no meaningful answer. it could be in any number of places (including 0) and any of those could change, or be accessible to different people, at any time
[18:56:40] <TinoDidriksen> burrows, why do you want to access git?
[18:56:44] <Robdgreat> burrows: what is it you're actually trying to do?
[18:56:46] <Robdgreat> hah
[18:56:55] <burrows> i just want a git link in about
[18:57:17] <TinoDidriksen> Then...put a link in About.
[18:57:25] <__adrian> then (a) put the link in your "about" page text
[18:57:37] <__adrian> (b) make a config item for it
[18:57:43] <__adrian> probably (a)
[18:58:01] <TinoDidriksen> If you use "git remote" people who fork your repo or download the tar.gz will get a wrong URL anyway.
[18:58:06] <__adrian> or, you could actually publish it as a package (e.g., composer)
[18:58:24] <burrows> i'll make a function that reads "~/projects/foo/.git/config"
[18:58:39] <burrows> thanks guys :)
[18:58:43] <TinoDidriksen> That's not guaranteed to exist.
[18:58:43] <__adrian> i think you missed every point made above

[19:54:09] <biberu> i'm going to lift those weights MY way!
[19:54:13] <__adrian> everyone was answering your question and trying to explain what the better solution was.
[19:54:26] <__adrian> and why what you were chasing was a poor solution.
[19:54:39] <__adrian> this is being _helpful_, not arrogant.
[19:55:46] <__adrian> burrows: ^  (not biberu sorry)
[20:00:52] <burrows> I asked a "how to" question and you assumed a) I was working on a website, b) it's my own project and not a request from the team leader and c) everything is standard. Instead of an answer I got, "do it another way because that's wrong."
[20:01:30] <__adrian> we (i, at least) made none of those assumptions
[20:01:51] <__adrian> and none of them have any impact on why the solution you wanted was bad/unreliable
[20:02:05] <burrows> I said "about section" and you said "add it to your about page"
[20:02:21] <__adrian> s/page/section/  ftfy
[20:03:00] <__adrian> "page" didn't have to mean "webpage," here.
[20:03:05] <biberu> provide more context if it's that important
[20:03:09] <__adrian> ^
[20:03:17] <__adrian> people also asked you about that, repeatedly
[20:03:32] <__adrian> "what do you really need to solve?"
[20:04:25] <burrows> I needed to find a way to get the git URL of its self so that's what I wanted a answer for
[20:04:59] <__adrian> "of itself"  // and the problem here is, there's no such thing as "itself."  your php code _does not have_ a git url.
[20:05:05] <__adrian> git has a git url.
[20:05:25] <burrows> It's not an easy question to ask
[20:05:40] <burrows> so I have foo as an example
[20:05:42] <__adrian> i'm pretty sure i understand your question
[20:05:47] <burrows> gave*
[20:06:05] <__adrian> but in order to make sure, you'll have to listen and understand my answers
[20:06:37] <__adrian> trying to look that up from your php code is unreliable, because it may be running on a differnt computer or the git remotes may have been changed or not exist (or git might not even be installed)
[20:06:57] <__adrian> if you want to have the repo url in your "about section" then just type it there.
[20:07:17] <burrows> right, so I used a git command to demonstrate the output I would like to get in php
[20:07:28] <__adrian> OR publish your software as a package (e.g., using composer) which knows how to provide that info.
[20:07:52] <__adrian> "burrows> right, so I used a git command to demonstrate the output I would like to get in php"  // you cannot know that git is installed, OR that it has the info you want.
[20:07:58] <burrows> composer isn't an option :(
[20:08:08] <__adrian> then (a)
[20:08:15] <__adrian> type the url in your about section
[20:08:24] <burrows> git doesn't need to be installed
[20:08:32] <__adrian> it does if you want to use it
[20:08:39] <__adrian> which is what you're takling about
[20:08:43] <burrows> I want similar output as git
[20:08:57] <__adrian> where do you think the info will come from?
[20:09:29] <__adrian> if you do  system(git ...)  and git's not installed, where do you think the output will come from?
[20:09:30] <burrows> config files
[20:09:38] <__adrian> php _does not have_ the info you're looking for.
[20:09:44] <__adrian> what config files?

[20:10:31] <burrows> or if no config file return an empty string
[20:10:38] <__adrian> ^ that's what i mean by unreliable
[20:10:48] <__adrian> why not just type the url in your about section?
[20:10:59] <__adrian> it will always be there, and there's no expense in trying to find it.
[20:11:01] <burrows> because it's constantly changing
[20:11:04] <biberu> technically he might have the database and could read it manually, but... why?
[20:11:31] <__adrian> why would it change? especially "constantly"?
[20:11:51] <burrows> early stages and project name changes etc
[20:12:08] <__adrian> that seems like an odd situation, but ...ok
[20:12:12] <burrows> but that's going off topic to my "how to" question
[20:12:13] <__adrian> make a project config setting then
[20:12:14] <biberu> won't that mean you have to update readmes and whatnot anyway?
[20:12:16] <__adrian> no
[20:12:18] <TinoDidriksen> That belongs in a config file - one that's not committed.
[20:12:18] <__adrian> it's not
[20:12:24] <__adrian> it's VERY on-topic.
[20:12:38] <__adrian> it gets you a good answer instead of an uninformed one.
[20:13:13] <burrows> readme is not my concern
[20:13:17] <burrows> lol
[20:13:32] <__adrian> "how do i do the EXACT thing i'm asking about" is not a valid question. you're assuming you already have the correct answer - and if you did, then you wouldn't be asking anyway.
[20:14:02] <burrows> i scraped the answer from ~/projects/foo/.git/config
[20:14:09] <burrows> but i didn't know about that file
[20:14:15] <__adrian> burrows: "__adrian> make a project config setting then"
[20:15:00] <biberu> this is such a strange thing to spend hours on
[20:15:22] <__adrian> if you want to know what git knows, then ask git. like, from the terminal. it's NOT information about your project / that your project should ever know about.
[20:15:51] <burrows> if it was a git question then i would've asked in #git
[20:16:18] <burrows> i wanted to know if there were built-in functions or something
[20:16:31] <__adrian> it is a git question, and it's one you already know the answer to. the flaw is trying to make your php code aware of it.
[20:16:32] <biberu> what are you building anyway, it's not s website, but you're still using php?
[20:16:55] <__adrian> "remote git url" is not anything to do with your php code.
[20:17:14] <burrows> i understand it goes against standard design patterns
[20:17:24] <__adrian> no, it's not that kind of question
[20:17:44] <__adrian> it literally doesn't belong where you're trying to put it. that's why you're finding it so hard to do.
[20:18:07] <__adrian> i.e., putting square pegs in square holes is not a "convention"
[20:18:13] <__adrian> it's what works

[20:31:12] <__adrian> recommend not deciding which answer you want in advance

[20:31:45] <burrows> i didn't know about the git config file
[20:32:08] <burrows> so that would've been a good answer

[20:32:38] <__adrian> you said that as part of your question

[20:45:23] <__adrian> "burrows> if i don't want to consider something i get respsonses like, "biberu screams into the void""  yeah, this is because it makes us feel like we're wasting our time.
[20:46:04] <__adrian> "burrows> that's assuming a standard environment"  no, it's assuming github (which is not assumption, but was part of your question)
[20:46:34] <TinoDidriksen> All the other git hosting services also let people download without using git.
[20:46:47] <burrows> it's assuming people will be using the downloaded archives
[20:47:08] <__adrian> no, it's assuming they _can_ (and they can, so again, not an assumption)

[20:47:52] <__adrian> painting yourself into the "it works if you use it exactly they way i want you to" isn't all that valid either. that's what i mean by "works by accident"
