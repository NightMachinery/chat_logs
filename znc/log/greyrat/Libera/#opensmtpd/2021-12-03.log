[03:22:51] <rak> jrmu: I think the format of your virtuals table is wrong. Some lines have colons and others don't. Take a look at table(5).
[03:23:00] <rak> Try dropping the colons
[03:23:06] <jrmu> i tried, that didn't help either
[03:23:16] <jrmu> I don't think the colons are the issue
[03:24:22] <rak> Regardless, unless it's the case that colons are accepted but undocumented (I'm too lazy to check the source), the format is wrong according to the man page.
[03:26:38] <jrmu> they use it in $ man aliases
[03:27:02] <rak> Also, is breadofgod.org supposed to deliver on the same host as dovecot? Or are you trying to relay it elsewhere?
[03:27:29] <jrmu> relay it elsewhere
[03:27:33] <jrmu> breadofgod.org is a separate mail server
[03:28:43] <jrmu> if you could point me to the relevant source code, that might help actually
[03:28:51] <jrmu> then I could figure out why exactly it's not recognizing it
[03:36:39] <rak> jrmu: I don't know where it is, but I imagine grepping for 'virtual' under usr.sbin/smtpd would find it
[03:36:42] <rak> (I'm just a user)
[03:36:50] <jrmu> ah, ok I may check there

[18:51:06] <jrmu> can anyone help? I've been stuck on this aliases forawrding thing now for 48 hrs
[18:53:04] <jrmu> https://paste.ircnow.org/wp6zwtab8hm3wp6j4t6n
[18:53:34] <jrmu> The thing is I have the exact same setup on another mail server, and it works--but this setup won't work here
[18:54:33] <jrmu> it works fine for jrmu.host.oddprotocol.org but it won't forward for ircnow.org
[18:54:38] <jrmu> it is driving me insane
[18:54:57] <jrmu> is there some sort of old stale cache of /etc/mail/virtuals floating around somewhere that I need to delete?

[19:21:37] <jrmu> OK I think I found the cause
[19:23:01] <jrmu> might there be some sort of cache, or perhaps /etc/passwd or something being read
[19:23:10] <jrmu> that is affecting how the virtuals table is being parsed?
[19:28:54] <oZZ> newaliases(8)!?
[19:29:52] <jrmu> hm, I think it's due to auth issues for relaying
[19:36:26] <jrmu> thanks oZZ 
[19:42:20] <jrmu> instead of saying 'refused to relay' it said 'invalid recipient', causing me no end of hair pulling
