[20:09:00] <rawtaz> dont forget to patch your linux kernels for CVE-2022-25636
[20:14:16] <slaughter> I REFUSE
[20:15:39] <rawtaz> NOW THAT YOU SAY IT
[20:15:41] <rawtaz> me too >_<
[20:16:01] <rawtaz> we will go to history as the ones that refused to be pussied by some silly netfilter vuln noone *actually* cares about
[20:24:05] <slaughter> Also I just don't have any linux kernels to patch :D
[20:24:23] <rawtaz> what kernels do you have then?
[20:24:48] <lantech19446> I patch my Linux boxes everyday automatically so I should be good
[20:26:00] <slaughter> rawtaz I use macOS personally. Anything in the cloud is short lived containers and using trusted upstream providers
[20:26:35] <rawtaz> lantech19446: does that ever fail?
[20:26:52] <lantech19446> Hasn't yey
[20:26:59] <lantech19446> Yet
[20:27:09] <rawtaz> interesting. can you point me to what you set up to do it?
[20:27:18] <lantech19446> Ansible 
[20:27:47] <lantech19446> I just wrote a playbook with update script and let it reboot them if necessary
[20:28:06] <rawtaz> ok so ansible running apt update and so on scheduled?
[20:28:24] <lantech19446> Only time I run into issues is if Ansible reboots because it's encrypted and needs a passphrase but prtg tells me when it goes down
[20:28:34] <lantech19446> Yep just use cron
[20:29:24] <lantech19446> I even update my windows boxes with it my servers update every 3 hours
[20:30:01] <rawtaz> *that* is brave. i mean if you have a debian box auto-updating, thats fine. but auto-updating windows servers,, brave :P
[20:30:04] <rawtaz> takes courage! :P
[20:30:34] <rawtaz> its almost more common than not that people have problems due to updates, and MS has to best case release fixes or worst case pull updates back..

[20:31:15] <lantech19446> The only thing that comes down that regularly is defender definitions which are usually harmless but I can add stuff to a reject list or tell it to only update certain categories etc 
[20:31:29] <rawtaz> :)
[20:31:51] <lantech19446> I love Ansible it has made me so much more productive and proactive
[20:31:58] <rawtaz> did you ever try salt?
[20:32:04] <lantech19446> Not yet
[20:32:38] <rawtaz> ive used ansible in the past but am curious to give salt a second chance
[20:32:57] <lantech19446> One of these days I'm going to write a playbook to do all the configs and extraneous installs for my patron computers 
[20:33:06] <rawtaz> i feel it kind of makes more sense in a tf-deployed environment, that the nodes just continously pull config from a central point, instead of being pushed to
[20:33:46] <lantech19446> Yea I haven't done anything with docker k8s or terrarorm yet
[20:34:30] <lantech19446> Thinking of that I gotta watch my docker class soon
[20:37:52] <rawtaz> which one, where?
[20:41:03] <lantech19446> On udemy docker mastery with kubernetes and swarm from a docker captain
[20:41:20] <rawtaz> who? nana?
[20:41:29] <rawtaz> el capitano
[20:41:35] <lantech19446> Bret fisher
[20:42:01] <rawtaz> theres something fishy about his name there.. in particular given the context..
[20:42:08] * rawtaz not sure
[20:42:09] <lantech19446> Lol
