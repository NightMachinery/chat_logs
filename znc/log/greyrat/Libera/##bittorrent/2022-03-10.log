[01:25:13] <Exa> Hi, I have read the spec for DHT (BEP 5, and a few others for extensions) but I'm unable to understand everything, for example the role of "buckets" and why limiting its size to 8.  Do you know an article that explains things involved?  Thanks.
[01:58:14] <TheSHADOW> Look up the details for Kademlia/Khashmir.
[02:36:51] <Exa> TheSHADOW: wikipedia goes too much into maths and I don't understand what is written, I want things written in simpler terms.  just explaining how it is done doesn't answer why it is done like that.
