[15:31:01] <holycow> hi everyone
[15:31:31] <holycow> how do nyxt users handle having a large volume of organized into many subfolders bookmarks?
[15:32:08] <holycow> i imported mine from firefox and i can list them on a page, i can see them in a bookmark side bar
[15:32:17] <holycow> but looks like the categorization is lost
[15:32:33] <holycow> and it doesn't seem easy enough to really access them
[15:32:42] <holycow> just curious how other users manage bookmarks

[15:49:05] <edgarvincent[m]> holycow: I'm interested in this as well. Some time ago, I started working on a package similar to org-elfeed for Emacs. I think it would be nice if bookmarks could be organised into headings as well as tags in an org file.
[15:49:50] <holycow> ah, org elfeed is interesting
[15:49:57] <edgarvincent[m]> Ideally, this org type buffer could be displayed in a side buffer, with org type bindings for folding/unfolding, etc.
[15:50:15] <edgarvincent[m]> But all that is way above my abilities at the moment.
[15:50:27] <holycow> between my post and now i was thinking about this idea
[15:50:43] <holycow> and i was thinking about how my workflow is so firefox centric
[15:51:09] <edgarvincent[m]> Something like Firefox's tree-style tabs with org syntax and bindings would be very good, I think.
[15:51:14] <holycow> that maybe its time to build a bookmarking web app based on CLOG (https://github.com/rabbibotton/clog)
[15:51:56] <edgarvincent[m]> CLOG looks very nice.
[15:52:26] <holycow> that would offload the bookmarks to a separate app and it could be made to provide a home page like firefox.  i basically start firefox and have like 12 bookmarks on the home page i visit a lot.  then in the toolbar i have a bunch
[15:52:33] <holycow> but
[15:52:45] <holycow> maybe it doesn't belong in a browser, maybe it belongs as an app
[15:52:58] <holycow> CLOG is a common lisp web ui framework.  its really neat.
[15:53:02] <edgarvincent[m]> There also have been discussions about a GUI library with regard to the nyxtmuch package. I am not sure what the state of that is.
[15:53:11] <holycow> aha neat
[15:53:29] <edgarvincent[m]> Let me find the issue.
[15:53:57] <holycow> okay so i am not imagining things that having massive amounts of bookmarks in subfolders doesn't have a more interesting way to be managed in nyxt?
[15:54:53] <edgarvincent[m]> See https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/1190 and https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/tree/master/libraries/user-interface
[15:55:13] <edgarvincent[m]> I'm not sure how CLOG would fit into this.
[15:55:25] <holycow> it wouldn't
[15:55:35] <holycow> for me it would be a local web app that i would run locally
[15:55:47] <holycow> and then nyxt would just load the app up as a home page
[15:55:48] <edgarvincent[m]> Or a Nyxt extension?
[15:55:57] <edgarvincent[m]> Ah, I see.
[15:56:04] <holycow> it wouldn't be a nyxt extension either
[15:56:17] <holycow> just a shortcut in nyxt to go to that local web app for bookmarks
[15:56:19] <edgarvincent[m]> Why not? To be independent of Nyxt?
[15:56:42] <holycow> oh this is just brain storming
[15:56:46] <edgarvincent[m]> It would be nice to be able to set the bindings and configuration within Nyxt, though.
[15:57:05] <holycow> i'm just thinking quick and dirty
[15:57:08] <holycow> so think of it this way
[15:57:19] <holycow> one shortcut to go to the local web app
[15:57:26] <holycow> local web app (clog is all common lisp)
[15:57:31] <edgarvincent[m]> Also, allowing Emacs to interact with it would be nice.
[15:57:52] <holycow> i can easily replicate pulldown menus to replicate bookmark folders from firefox
[15:57:53] <holycow> plus
[15:58:12] <holycow> i can easily recreate the firefox startup pages with the main shortcut icons that i visit
[15:59:03] <holycow> because it is common lisp, it would be easy enough to create an api so nyxt can just access the data the data through a buffer
[15:59:07] <holycow> just thinking out loud
[15:59:16] <holycow> not sure if it makes any sense
[15:59:38] <edgarvincent[m]> That sounds nice. The prompt buffer is nice for "flattening" and filtering the list of bookmarks, but a hierarchical list would be nice too.
[16:00:00] <holycow> and a lazy graphical interface too
[16:00:09] <edgarvincent[m]> Have a look at org-elfeed :) I think it is a good model.
[16:00:49] <holycow> this is the first i heard of it, looking.  thanks for the tip.
[16:00:51] <edgarvincent[m]> And please let us know if you make any progress :)
[16:01:25] <holycow> also, its crazy how little of the web you can use without adblockers
[16:01:39] <holycow> you cant watch a single youtube video without TWO ads now
[16:01:41] <edgarvincent[m]> Indeed.
[16:02:02] <holycow> have you managed to get ad blocking working with that adblocker integration project yet?
[16:02:54] <edgarvincent[m]> Which one? The Webkit extension?
[16:03:12] <holycow> well not sure, that sounds like what i was reading about earlier
[16:06:11] <edgarvincent[m]> I haven't tried, anyway.
[16:07:25] <holycow> oh i see why you want to do orgmode / elfeed bookmarks
[16:07:28] <holycow> that is a really good idea
[16:11:41] <edgarvincent[m]> I think it would fit in nicely: 1) It would make the bookmark list easily editable. 2) It would allow the browsing of the list easier :)
[16:11:55] <edgarvincent[m]> s/allow/make
[16:11:56] <holycow> you are absolutely correct
[16:12:05] <holycow> and it would allow export to html
[16:12:14] <holycow> for import into other browsers if necessary or whatever
[16:14:09] <edgarvincent[m]> Indeed!
[16:15:34] <edgarvincent[m]> I don't know enough Lisp to write such a package yet though.
[16:16:30] <holycow> I don't either.  I guess it's time to learn.
[16:17:29] <edgarvincent[m]> Indeed. But there is so little time :)
[16:18:39] <edgarvincent[m]> I wish I had Prot's discipline and productivity. He didn't have any programming skills two years ago or so, and look at him now ^^ (and we have the exact same educational background, so I have no excuse)
[16:26:13] <edgarvincent[m]> Anyway, back to it. Happy lime Monday everyone!
[16:26:29] <holycow> thanks for the feedback
[16:28:24] <edgarvincent[m]> Thank you! I'm very interested in this, so please let me know if you have other ideas.

[16:50:22] <Jing> The idea is useful. I was just thinking that it may need to be compatible with formats from bookmarks exported from different browsers? I only use Firefox and never changed my browser, so I do not know if they all have the same formats...
