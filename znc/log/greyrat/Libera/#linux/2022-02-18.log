[00:21:13] <Sayona> tirnanog, is more ok to create a bash script file? and copy it over ssh?
[00:21:14] <tirnanog> Sayona: well, I suppose it does deal with the problem of sudo environment filtering.
[00:21:50] <tirnanog> Sayona: yeah, that would be another perfectly applicable method. it doesn't obviate the need to correctly requote your parameters when invoking the remote script, though (so @Q and %q are still relevant).
[00:22:12] <Sayona> thanks, let me try
[00:23:35] <tirnanog> Sayona: for example, it would still have to be something like "sudo /your/remote/script {BORG_PASSPHRASE@Q} {BORG_PASSPHRASE@Q} ...' with said script collecting the positional parameters ($1, $2 ...)

[01:44:47] <F8ER> Perhaps, it's because tabs are quite differently indented in various editors/viewers by defauly while spaces are usually not. So, it's kind of a non-constant behavior elimination.
[01:44:58] <chronon> I have a VM that will not display it's graphical screen after startup. It's an Ubuntu desktop system. I've tried rsync -niaHAX comparing its /etc with another very similar VM that works fine, but I cannot spot the difference.

[01:57:05] <Dagmar> If it's broken on one of them, the log file it generates is usually your best bet for getting clues as to what's misconfigured.

[02:01:41] <chronon> The other VM didn't have an xorg.conf in the first place. I think it once had one because that's how I initially told it what resolution to use, but it seems Xorg deleted the xorg.conf file from that VM automatically (or possibly during an update) and yet the desktop still has the resolution I defined (which tells me there's somewhere else that state/config/settings has been stored.

[02:03:43] <chronon> Well, clearly there is some residual state on the working one left over from when I defined a screen resolution in its xorg.conf that has since been disappeared.

[03:36:20] <ayecee> not for actually solving the problem.
[03:36:45] <chronon> stopping and starting lightdm worked fine. Nothing to report about that. But I did notice in systemctl status lightdm a log line in red saying "gkr-pam: unable to locate daemon control file" before I stopped it the first time.
[03:36:50] <tangy> huh, I formatted a 62G flash drive as NTFS from Windows, plugged it into linux to erase it, and the kernel only saw ~1G. dd if=/dev/zero of=... found no space left on device, and blockdev found an ioctl error. and yet, windows still reads it as NTFS and the video files are still playable.  wtf?

[04:48:31] <yrdsb> and it was super easy to use

[04:48:38] <interestingname> it has great support online, and stuff that works for other OSes also mostly work on it
[04:48:42] <yrdsb> debian was way easier to install then arch

[05:31:17] <rbox> omegatron: how are you building this system?
[05:31:23] <omegatron> well, it starts into the grub bootloader, I select the kernel and then go

[05:32:25] <omegatron> right now, i'm booting it with a kubunt 18.x sub drive and do a chroot into the target disk, to build more packages ...

[06:26:56] <znf> what kind of data could possibly be interpreted as a partition table?
[06:27:07] <Dagmar> Random data
[06:27:16] <Dagmar> It'll just be a mess, and it would be somewhat rare
[06:27:16] <znf> that's a hell of a random chance
[06:27:27] <ayecee> sure.

[07:02:28] <Betal> what cause system to "no longer work" after the chmod 777 in entire /, isn't it supose to still boot and able to write and read where it is needed?
[07:02:46] <znf> Betal, some components will fail to start due to world-wide permissions
[07:02:54] <ayecee> Betal: i reckon it would be services complaining about files that were supposed to be private and now aren't, like crypto keys
[07:03:02] <Dagmar> Some things, like sshd, actually _care_ when sensitive files are modifyable by someone other than the owner
[07:03:13] <znf> ie: if you chmod 777 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, you can no longer log on with a private key
[07:03:42] <Dagmar> It's also going to become somewhat irate by the fact that the sshd server key is no longer private
[07:03:44] <Betal> so the server actually is running, but the ssh "no longer works", so the guy think the server was not working?
[07:03:54] <znf> Betal, it's hit or miss
[07:04:09] <ayecee> Betal: well i mean if it no longer accepts requests, it's not working
[07:04:14] <Dagmar> We built these systems to actually have a security model with meaning

[08:03:26] <Guest83> I figured it wasn't a complex problem.

[08:04:24] <sheep> if it's lvm, you can use lvresize to resize it
[08:04:38] <Dagmar> llvm is a compiler unrelated to swap

[08:07:20] <Dagmar> You need at least "a little" always for the convenience of the kernel

[08:08:02] <Dagmar> If you're not usign hibernation that writes the system's memory into swap, then you can just go with "whatever you think you need"
[08:08:17] <dre> currently it was set to 1G swap, 16G ram, but both are maxing out a bit
[08:08:32] <dre> yeah cheers, I might just go with setting it to 8G now and see how it goes
[08:08:35] <Dagmar> Well, if you're acutally _using_ that gigabyte then bumping it up to two gigs seems perfectly reasonable
[08:08:48] <Dagmar> 8g is also still pretty reasonable
[08:09:15] <dre> lvresize has "--resizefs" to resize underlying filesystem; would this save the mkswap call? ( not that it matters really, just curious)

Here's the

[17:38:13] <Psi-Jack> pantato: 20 years? I think you're exagerating.
[17:38:13] <hexnewbie> Any of .debs faults are in the built system, to be honest. ANd rpm's a cooler tool
[17:38:17] <pantato> I'd give credence to .rpm. I haven't given it a fair shot. But .deb has failed me over and over and over. I *hate* debian and all of the "distros" based off of it
[17:38:23] <Inline> fldme: you lack the encodings and/or the font glyphs (not all fonts have all glyphs)

[17:39:56] <Psi-Jack> rascul: Sad, but true.
[17:40:06] <Dagmar> Inline: Things which _use Freetype_ can have fallback fonts for missing glyphs
[17:40:07] <rascul> open build system is quite nice
[17:40:10] <Psi-Jack> But, it's really a simple command I found, it's just not as simple as createrepo path
[17:40:15] <hexnewbie> hodapp: Simple .spec file -- and understandable one so you need little documentation reading (hint: I did none) -- run rpmbuild on it, and have a package.
[17:40:21] <Dagmar> Anything using font spec strings _does not_
[17:41:00] <pantato> f843d0, and the best thing about it is if something actually does go wrong with an update, they make it *extremely* easy to remedy with their archive system and the like
[17:41:10] <Inline> Dagmar: when does the fallback happen ? char wise ?
[17:41:40] <pantato> if something breaks after an update, and i don't want to deal with the issue, i just set pacman.con to a week ago and roll it again and all it well
[17:41:44] <Dagmar> It happens when something asks it to render a glyph that the current font lacks and it knows about a fallback font
[17:41:51] <Inline> ah
[17:41:52] <pantato> it's an excellent package manager
[17:41:56] <Inline> so character wise ok

[17:59:30] <blackop> hdd is plugged to a PC which is dual booting with windows and linux
[17:59:32] <Psi-Jack> blackop: So you want to share raw block data over the network?
[17:59:38] <blackop> yes
[17:59:42] <Psi-Jack> blackop: No.
[17:59:44] <blackop> all hdd from network
[17:59:45] <Psi-Jack> blackop: You do not.
[17:59:48] <blackop> why?
[17:59:50] <Psi-Jack> lol
[17:59:52] <Dagmar> Then nothing is going to work reliably with that
[17:59:56] <rascul> share the fs not the block device
[18:00:00] <Psi-Jack> heh
[18:00:10] <Psi-Jack> blackop: Goes to show, you need to use correct terms.
[18:00:13] <Dagmar> Kodi isn't goign to be very happy with you when the samba share unexpectedly goes away because you reboot the thing

[18:05:58] <Dagmar> ...or just don't come to us asking for help when Kodi can no longer play videos after you've rebooted your desktop.
[18:06:03] <blackop> cheapest one is more than 100 bucks

Yet, I wish wayland support was stronger, specially for my 2in1 old laptop with touchscreen

[22:15:42] <Cera> I am trying to configure Pycharm to use my Anaconda environment within WSL. When I go through the Create Project and click to use a previously configured interpreter, how do I find the right "Interpreter"?

[22:16:50] <hexnewbie> The root will also get cached, and not get written to. /var, ~/.cache and ~/.local/share will get plenty of writes to make your life on a spinner unpleasant
