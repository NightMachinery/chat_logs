[00:03:16] <muradm> hi #css, when i specify "font-family: sans-serif;" does it mean that browsers will display in font whatever is configured in user's environment that match sans-serif? let's say linux user set sans-serif to "DeJavu" and windows user set it to something else, they will see text in their own font's right?
[00:03:59] <muradm> does any one do such thing? any example website/blog/personal-site that follows that logic?
[00:07:14] <muradm> wrong place to ask? :)

[00:10:27] <phryk> muradm: you understand how sans-serif works correctly, yes. I've known a few tech people who do this, but don't remember the URLs to their sites, tho^^
[00:12:26] <muradm> phryk: thanks!
[00:12:52] <muradm> will appreciate for any example tho :)
[00:13:51] <muradm> may be some article that advertises such approach
[00:14:21] *** Quits: bambanxx (~bambanx@pc-223-49-214-201.cm.vtr.net) (Quit: My MacBook Air has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[00:14:37] <muradm> i find it useful, but searching web for "without fonts" is out of luck, only "15 best fonts" etc. :D
[00:14:46] <phryk> nothing much to advise on, i reckon. the defaults for sans-serif and serif are usually extremely well legible and typographic defaults in browser stylesheets are pretty good, too.
[00:16:31] *** Joins: bambanxx (~bambanx@pc-223-49-214-201.cm.vtr.net)
[00:18:39] <muradm> sorry, i was meaning that, there zillions of articles like "why web-safe fonts are important", "how to do website fonts in best way" etc. i could not find any article or point of view like "why don't use custom fonts", or "simplicity and caveats with default system fonts" etc.
[00:19:09] *** Joins: biggusnickus (~biggusdic@user/biggusdickus)
[00:19:40] <muradm> i.e. i would like to hear the other side point of view, and can't find any
[00:21:14] <phryk> well, one thing why i only use custom fonts on my website begrudgingly is that fonts are executable code and there have been known exploits in font rendering engines. but i mean, if you use js it's not like that's a problem you don't already have.
[00:22:26] <phryk> another reason would be that you don't have to worry about font licenses and the fact that it's really hard to find a font that offers legibility as good as the default supplied ones.
[00:23:49] <phryk> especially if you use sans-serif for the main text you'll need an extremely well-crafted font if you don't want to strain your users eyes.
[00:24:48] *** Quits: bambanxx (~bambanx@pc-223-49-214-201.cm.vtr.net) (Quit: My MacBook Air has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[00:26:24] <muradm> exactly for that reason, my conclusion is that, if i'm going to share information in the form of article/blog/personal-site, i want to share just information, there is no same taste for people. by choosing this strategy, i don't want to disturb visitor's eyes, even more, i want them be more comfortable with font of their choice
[00:27:10] <muradm> for instance, when i visit some blog post or article, most times it is pain for me to adapt for someone's weird font choice
[00:27:45] <muradm> doable? yes, we automatically adapt, since we need that information

I'm thoroughly enjoying learning this though and I seem to be not to bad at it so far

[03:10:35] <lantech19446> ok gonna need some help with error 1 because I don't understand what I did wrong
[03:10:50] <FunkyBob> having an <a> inside a <button> ?
[03:11:01] <FunkyBob> two clickable elements nested?
[03:11:19] <FunkyBob> <button type="button" id="button"><a href="donationform.php" id="click">donate now</a></button></h1>↩
[03:11:27] <FunkyBob> why do you even have the button element?
[03:11:48] <FunkyBob> the <a> makes it a link... which seems to be what  you want it to be
[03:11:59] <FunkyBob> what was your reason for adding the <button> around it?
[03:12:06] <lantech19446>     I wanted a button that goes to donation form
[03:12:15] <FunkyBob> <a> does that
[03:12:23] <FunkyBob> if y ou don't like now it looks, that's what CSS is for
[03:12:37] <lantech19446> I can make it look like a button in css?
[03:12:45] <FunkyBob> you can make it look however you like
[03:13:24] <FunkyBob> don't use HTML for how it looks; use it for what it tells you about the structure of the content

[03:13:35] <lantech19446> what i don't get is i see buttons that take you to other pages all the time, how are they doing it if they don't put an a link in there?
[03:13:51] <FunkyBob> well, that depends...
[03:13:59] <FunkyBob> sometimes they will be a <a> gussied up
[03:14:18] <FunkyBob> other times it's lazy/stupid devs using buttons + Javascript instead of a simple <a>
[03:14:42] <FunkyBob> there's a whole generation of front-enders who don't know what HTML can do, and reimplement it [poorly] with <div>s and JS
[03:14:51] <FunkyBob> </rant>
[03:15:30] <lantech19446> ok well I don't want to become one of those, I want to do things the right way
[03:15:41] <FunkyBob> KISS :)
[03:16:10] <FunkyBob> I find this site has a very accessible list of html5 elements - http://html5doctor.com/
[03:16:20] <FunkyBob> as well as good details on what they mean, how  they're supposed to be used, etc
[03:16:36] <FunkyBob> as well as this image to help cure DIVitis - http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.png
[03:17:02] <lantech19446> yay it validates now
[03:17:45] <lantech19446> I've been using ID's a lot but not classes or divs I don't truly understand what the difference in the uses is
[03:17:58] <FunkyBob> ID is identity... there can be only one
[03:18:11] <FunkyBob> class is for classifying things... denoting things with similarities
[03:18:34] <FunkyBob> DIV is the archetypal block element... it gives no semantic meaning beyond "this is a block of releated content"
[03:18:59] <FunkyBob> use ID when you need to identify that exact element.
[03:19:05] <lantech19446> ok so I really don't need to use div if I don't want to but in some cases it could make my code easier to read as long as I don't overuse it
[03:19:22] <FunkyBob> as you cqn see from that flow chart, it has its place
[03:19:55] <FunkyBob> i find now that html5 has given us section, article, header, footer, aside, main... I have fewer uses for div
[03:20:22] <FunkyBob> you will still see a lot of stuff like "<div class='header' ..."
[03:20:40] <FunkyBob> ooh
[03:20:56] <FunkyBob> oksushi: "think of classes like adjectives"... how's that scan? :)
[03:21:22] * FunkyBob suspects oksushi is still asleep, since it's not even 9am on a Saturday for him
[03:22:26] <lantech19446> classes make sense now I just don't have anything that similar yet
[03:23:09] <FunkyBob> so you might have a <p>  ... and it contains an error message, so maybe you'll <p class="error">
[03:23:26] <FunkyBob> so then in your CSS you can easily say, for instance, all error messages are red.....   .error { color: red; }
[03:25:11] <lantech19446> the validator is going haywire, it's telling me that i have to body tags open in my goals.html page and there definitely isn't
[03:26:30] <lantech19446> what did you think of the site other than the few errors?
[03:27:45] <FunkyBob> sorry, didn't actually look yet...
[03:27:55] <FunkyBob> trying to badger my team into reviewing all my outstanding PRs
[03:28:01] <lantech19446> ok

[09:32:29] <digitok> hey, i just want to confirm that there's no way to make a locally scoped variable that applies to multiple definitions
[09:33:54] <digitok> i.e. i can create a global variable inside :root { }, or i can create a local variable inside a single .definition { }, but i can't create a local variable that can be accessed by multiple definitions within some type of wrapper
[09:52:25] <pavonia> If they are all descendants of the same wrapper, you can
[09:57:45] <digitok> yea i thought about that
[09:58:37] <digitok> maybe i'll do it that way
[09:59:44] <pavonia> Why not just setting it for :root?
[10:00:13] <digitok> i was wanting to re-use the variable names for different sections
[10:01:04] <pavonia> You can set it to different values for different sections
[10:04:46] <digitok> yea, i could set the values in :root and then add an empty definition for each section wrapper which can be used to change a var's value
[10:06:02] <digitok> basically i'm making a custom user style for a website and i want to make it easy to edit both for me and anyone i give it to
[10:06:33] <digitok> so someone might want one section to have a different background colour than another section, where i have them the using the same colour etc
[10:10:02] <digitok> so this should make it easy to change a certain colour for a whole section for example, and if they just wanted to change a specific definition, they can do that by either entering the value manually, or creating an extra var in that section's wrapper
[10:11:04] <digitok> but thanks, this gives me ideas to work with :)
[10:13:56] <pavonia> Not sure why you'd need the empty value, though. If you make the var visible globally, users can change it everywhere they like
[10:15:43] <digitok> yea, but that'd change it everywhere
[10:16:14] <digitok> so, say there's a section that uses that var 5 times
[10:16:29] <digitok> i have an empty .section { } where they can modify that var's value for that specific section
[10:17:32] <digitok> (vs manually changing the 5 definitions)

[20:12:07] *** Quits: akaWolf (~akaWolf@akawolf.org) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[20:27:45] <DPA> Assuming you correctly adjusted the css selectors, it could be because of specificity. IDs have a higher specificity than classes. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity
[20:30:46] <lantech19446> ok I'll read that in a moment, it's a concept that i'm not familiar with. I also have this weird problem that if i make 2 id's and apply the same code to them it doesn't apply to the second ID so right now i'm being forced to apply the same ID twice which is working except it's fucking up the margin on the 2nd page even though the code is exactly the same and it's on the same screen

[20:38:58] <lantech19446> oooo so if i put a class within an img tag I should have been calling img.class???
[20:41:06] <DPA> yes
[20:41:10] <lantech19446> nope that didn't work either I don't understand what i have that's more specific that's overriding this
[20:42:02] <DPA> Most Browsers have developer tools for inspecting things & checking which rules it takes from where.
[20:44:18] <DPA> And if things don't change when they should, it can sometimes be a caching problem.
