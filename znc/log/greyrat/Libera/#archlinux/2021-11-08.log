[00:54:06] <tirnanog> arseru: actually, I think status might automatically defer to the user context, as long as you are running it as the intended user. anyway, it definitely matters for some operations so, if in doubt, and you're know you're dealing with a user service, better to specify it.

[00:57:29] <tirnanog> note that there is a difference between starting something on an ad-hoc basis, and enabling it so that it starts automatically in the future.
[00:57:59] <arseru> tirnanog: wow that's so weird, I just rebooted my machine, waited for `xdg-desktop-portal-{,gtk}` services to be active, and then opened nemo instantly
[00:58:25] <arseru> I didn't enable them yet, so it seems the problem wasn't there, but that they take a while to be active after starting my X session?
[00:58:57] <tirnanog> yes, it could be. but, in that case, does enabling help? I would expect it to but the proof would be in the pudding.

[01:00:02] <tirnanog> arseru: well, any program that runs in your name is free to start user-service if it wants to. the point is that, by enabling the service, systemd will take responsibility from this as soon as your session begins.
[01:00:13] <tirnanog> arseru: given that you're not using a full-blown desktop environment, that might work out better.
[01:00:47] <tirnanog> let's put it this way. there's no point in deferring the starting of these services if you're going to need them.

[02:17:23] <feral_hedgehog> I enabled hardware video decoding in Firefox and Google Meet stopped outputting video. The logs showed  it failing to use VP8 which has led me to this page where it says it's unsupported - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hardware_video_acceleration#VA-API_drivers

[02:29:53] <theh> With libvirt, when I define a pool without root using `virsh`, the pool cannot be found in `virt-manager` (launched without pw prompt). Only pools defined as superuser can be seen. Any idea why that might be?

[11:00:39] <Toxmi> I like to have a local alternative for google calendar (other than next-cloud, Korganizer, Gnome-calendar, etc). I've found really nice javascript alternatives such as (https://github.com/nhn/tui.calendar, or fullcalendar) but I want to run these locally, like an electron app wrap around them and just run them in my local machine. Is there a simple approach to build such thing?

[13:33:37] <arseru> Hi! When I boot my machine (lightdm + i3wm), there are some gtk apps (e.g. evince, nemo) that experience a 25s timeout with the error `Error calling StartServiceByName for org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop: Timeout was reached`. It looks like this is due to having the services xdg-desktop-portal{,-gtk} inactive, and trying to open those gtk apps activates them, which takes around 25s. This does not happen for example with `irccloud`; if I boot my 
[13:33:37] <arseru> machine, open `irccloud` and then `nemo`, I'm not experiencing any timeouts at all because `irccloud` seems to activate both services fast enough. Finally, I'm not able to manually enable both services (the message shown is `they are not meant to be enabled using systemctl`), so I don't know how to fix this. Should both services be always enabled for an Xsession, and if so, which component i responsible for it in my i3 setup?

[17:57:30] <grawity> also didn't you just say you don't want the messages to show up at all

[17:57:51] <grawity> if you disable all of them, does it really matter what timestamps they have
[17:58:30] <grawity> anyway, the default Arch console loglevel is 3 (ERR), you can lower it to 2 (CRIT) or 1 (ALERT) or 0 (EMERG) to hide errors
[17:58:30] *** Joins: jaca123 (~Thunderbi@89-65-136-254.dynamic.chello.pl)
[17:58:42] <grawity> either via the kernel boot option or using dmesg's --console-level
[17:58:55] <docmax> grawity, just in case i cant disable them, at least i want human readable time
[17:59:09] *** Quits: jaca123 (~Thunderbi@89-65-136-254.dynamic.chello.pl) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:59:49] <grawity> tbh the kernel's timestamps are useless if this is a machine that suspends/resumes
[17:59:57] <grawity> so in a sense you're better off with no timestamps than human-readable ones
[18:00:03] *** Quits: wingstroke (~wingstrok@193.37.32.44) (Quit: leaving)
[18:00:09] <grawity> it's easier to disable the whole messages than to get good timestamps
[18:00:31] <grawity> actually the one way you *can* get useful timestamps is by having e.g. syslogd or journald gather the messages from dmesg and forward to console
[18:00:50] <grawity> so take a look at ForwardToWall= and ForwardToConsole= in journald.conf
[18:00:54] <docmax> dmesg --console-level has alert, crit, debug, ... but no off?
[18:01:02] <grawity> that's "emerg"
[18:01:13] *** Joins: charlie5 (~rod@pa49-180-4-203.pa.nsw.optusnet.com.au)
[18:01:21] <docmax> i set ForwardToWall=off allready
[18:01:26] <grawity> because if the kernel actually writes a message at KERN_EMERG, at that point you're probably looking at a kernel panic or something anyway
[18:02:13] <docmax> ok
[18:02:55] <grawity> basically in normal operation you won't really *get* messages at emerg/alert (or probably even crit) levels, so for most intents and purposes those are the "off" options

[20:51:51] <jirido> Hi. I try to use netbrake with pacman but even if I set it to 1000000 or even to 10000000 that should translate to around 1Mb respectivly 10Mb it only load around 100Kb, Is there some extra trick to it? Some spacing between the zeros or something alike..

[21:13:35] <Phunyun> Any opinions on using bootd (from systemd) or any other boot managers over GRUB?
[21:14:13] <NetSysFire> systemd-boot is great and simple
[21:14:32] <NetSysFire> it works for most people, too. unless you want super fancy themes, go with it
[21:14:42] <NetSysFire> you dont see your bootloader much anyways
[21:14:56] <mingdao> So is syslinux.
[21:15:03] <Phunyun> I don't have a reason to not use GRUB, mostly just curious about the others given all I've ever seen is GRUB be auto-installed with every other distro.
[21:15:19] <NetSysFire> create a vm and try them out for yourself

[22:07:13] <heythere221> Hello:)  I have a question regarding the alsias function in the .basrc file, If I alias something like this: alias pacman='pacman --color=auto' and type 'pacman -Ss packagename' pacman searches for this package and outputs the result in color but as soon as I typoe a sudo infront of pacman the color output is gone because theres no alias for sudo... How do I alias a command that works with and
[22:07:15] <heythere221> without sudo infront? 
[22:07:38] <heythere221> btw I know wpacman has a color output option in pacman.conf but just asking how to achieve that with aliases.

[23:49:16] <SmarmyWalrus> So I have a relatively fresh install of Arch. It was made with ArchInstall, but I don't believe it should be relevant. I have installed and changed my shell to ZSH. I am attempting to add content to /etc/zshenv, /etc/zshrc, etc. as described in the man page for ZSH. I put in debugs (just basic echo'd text) to try and figure out which were actually being source upon launching an interactive shell (as well as a second TTY). However, 
[23:49:16] <SmarmyWalrus> nothing except my local .zshrc in my home dir is being source. Manually sourcing the files when already in the shell does work. Does anyone have any insight why these files aren't being loaded? I am trying to use the ZSH specific ones rather than the generic /etc/profile.d files since I'm using them to source in files that are zsh only
