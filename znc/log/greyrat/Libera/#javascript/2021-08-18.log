[00:41:50] <dviola> hi
[00:42:13] <dviola> is a variable defined with `var` a local one? or should I use `let` for that?
[00:45:03] <GreenJello> local to the function, while let/const are local to the block

[00:46:43] <matsaman> I'm gonna keep using var until I have a reason not to
[00:46:51] <matsaman> 'let' is the dumbest name
[00:47:03] <matsaman> 'const' makes sense as name, but I just don't need
[00:47:18] <dviola> is camelCase used more often rather than snake_case? I have a few coworkers telling me I should use the former, sigh
[00:47:18] <matsaman> tldr: matsaman is unpopular
[00:47:22] <GreenJello> 'let' is a good name, but 'const' is a dumb name for what it does
[00:47:30] <matsaman> dviola: JavaScript is pretty camelCase-y

[00:47:40] <matsaman> but snake_case is actually better, ignoring biases
[00:47:42] <sheetjs> and const is consistent with C const
[00:48:21] <dviola> ok, thanks
[00:48:30] <GreenJello> dviola, PascalCase for classes/constructors, SCREAMING_SNAKE for real constants, camelCase for everything else
[00:48:38] <matsaman> I don't feel the need personally to use camelCase just 'cause a lot of fugly crap built into the language does
[00:48:43] <systemfault> IMHO, "val" would have been nice instead of "const"
[00:48:58] <systemfault> matsaman: Yeah yeah, we know that you're cool like that, you rebel!
[00:49:01] <sheetjs> sadly snake_case isn't popular
[00:49:11] <matsaman> maybe 'local' instead of 'let'?
[00:49:18] <matsaman> systemfault: that's all I'm saying =P
[00:49:23] <systemfault> snake_case is my favorite... I'm just intelligent enough to use whatever is the standard for the language I use at the moment.
[00:49:39] <matsaman> yeah but then why write any of your own code at all

[00:51:39] <matsaman> so really I should probably be happy that so much JavaScript stuff is camelCasey
[00:51:42] <matsaman> =D
[00:51:59] <matsaman> would suck to have nonsense mistaken for something you wrote from scratch, heh
[00:52:23] <Alexendoo> I like either, but seeing them randomly mixed is gross, so I wouldn't want snake_case in JS
[00:53:30] * matsaman shrugs
[00:53:48] <sheetjs> at the end of the day, you will likely read the code more times than you will write it
[00:53:58] <systemfault> matsaman: You write code for other people... your personal preferences aren't really important :/
[00:54:00] <sheetjs> so you should optimize for that
[00:54:14] <matsaman> systemfault: yeah but neither are theirs, or they'd be able to write it themselves =D
[00:54:20] <matsaman> I know what you're saying, heh
[00:54:33] <sheetjs> systemfault: at that level, you're writing code for a javascript interpreter that doesn't care
[00:54:35] <matsaman> snake_case should be better for reading, I'll take what I can get
[00:54:59] <systemfault> sheetjs: You're writing code for other people in your team that will have to maintain it eventually.
[00:55:15] <sheetjs> `const x = 3; console.log(x)` is more or less the same as `const some_snaked_const = 3; console.log(some_snaked_const)`
[00:55:18] <systemfault> sheetjs: If you're a freelancer... then do whatever the F you want..
[00:55:21] <matsaman> let's be realistic, that never happens =P every 10 years some jerk replaces everything from scratch
[00:55:43] <matsaman> s/10/3
[00:55:47] <sheetjs> but that's an argument in favor of consistency, not specifically what the outside world recommends

[00:56:04] <seed0> http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/papers/ICPC2010-CamelCaseUnderScoreClouds.pdf
[00:56:06] <matsaman> =D
[00:56:08] <systemfault> sheetjs: Snake case is a lot easier to read.
[00:56:20] <sheetjs> if a team of people who are working on a project agree to use snake case, then snake case should be used
[00:56:30] <matsaman> seed0: gtfoutta here with yo science!
[00:56:42] <seed0> lol
[00:56:50] <matsaman> and if a team doesn't, then another team should be used woooooo-OOOO
[00:56:50] <sheetjs> that the JS community at large prefers camelCase or sArCaSe shouldn't have any bearing
[00:57:12] <matsaman> seed0: complete with ~user, nice
[00:57:17] <systemfault> sheetjs: Then you're stuck with a shit mix of both... fun.
[00:57:30] <matsaman> I mean you're stuck anyway
[00:57:36] <matsaman> 'typeof'?
[00:57:43] <sheetjs> you're stuck with myriads of strange decisions
[00:57:53] <sheetjs> like how months start with 0 but days start with 1
[00:57:54] <systemfault> sheetjs: Yeah.... why add more stupid ones on top?
[00:57:56] <matsaman> heh
[00:58:08] <matsaman> it's one aspect of uniformity you can actually control
[00:58:18] <matsaman> and code should be readable
[00:58:31] <matsaman> nevermind other developers, _I_ want to be able to read it
[00:58:37] <matsaman> and type it without going crazy
[00:59:01] <matsaman> but this can all be solved by switching to befunge
[00:59:54] <sheetjs> so as an example, we deal with files and it seems like every specification has its own writing and variable style

[01:02:04] <matsaman> it really doesn't matter as long as it's consistent
[01:02:22] <matsaman> you could pretty straightforwardly make a code style convertor for any _consistent_ usage

[01:02:36] <matsaman> actually even for inconsistent
[01:03:10] <sheetjs> sure matsaman that argument ultimately boils down to "the external world is inconsistent, we are free to choose a consistent standard even if it's not the one the community prefers"

[04:35:29] <lizzie> hi!  I have a question, does anybody know about any debugging tools available in or for major browsers, that would make it easy to output some debug information to file of my choice, when a javascript function is called, or to sync a variable to a file so that the file updates when the variable does?
[04:35:43] <moldorcoder7> what is the easiest way to clone an array and add a property to each object element
[04:36:20] <lizzie> do you want to clone the elements too, and add the property to the copies?
[04:37:07] <moldorcoder7> lizzie, clone the elements too
[04:37:31] <moldorcoder7> lizzie, or not actually im already doing an Object.assign
[04:37:41] <moldorcoder7> in the observable that send them
[04:40:25] <lizzie> I sadly don't know enough to help you then...
[04:40:53] <entuland> I'm screwed - my connection died and I'm on the mobile line, anyone has a link for a simple node.js webserver that will serve my HTML + CSS + JS (loaded as script type="module") and images? I can't run the files locally because damned CORS choking on the modules...
[04:40:55] <moldorcoder7> lizzie, for your case you can output to console.log with a specific tag then parse it from selemium web driver
[04:41:38] <entuland> nothing fancy, just serving whatever exists as a file in a specific folder subtree
[04:43:46] <lizzie> moldorcoder7: that makes sense, I will need to learn me some selenium then.  thanks!
[04:44:36] <KevinX> moldorcoder7 [{a: 'a'}, {b: 'b'}].map(t => (Object.assign(t, {foo: 'bar'})))

[04:49:20] <cis> entuland: replit.com
[04:50:39] <entuland> point is running completely local with no connection whatsoever - would it work for that?
[04:51:10] <sheetjs> entuland: no part of that requires a node.js webserver
[04:51:29] <sheetjs> you could use python -mSimpleHTTPServer
[04:51:29] <GreenJello> moldorcoder7, that doesn't clone; you need to pass {} as the first argument, or just use object spread
[04:51:29] <entuland> sheetjs, I don't follow
[04:51:50] <entuland> oh sure I can use python as well
[04:51:51] <entuland> thanks
[04:52:08] <sheetjs> it ships with python 2 so you don't need to install anything if you already have python
[04:52:27] <entuland> great, you're a savior - I have v3 installed almost for sure already
[04:52:31] <sheetjs> for node, there are a few npm modules like http-server and simplehttpserver
[04:52:48] <sheetjs> the python3 equivalent is python3 -m http.server
[04:54:15] <sheetjs> https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs/blob/master/Makefile#L134 probably should use a node module here instead of python
[04:55:03] <moldorcoder7> GreenJello, any example  , im a bit rusty with js in general :)
[04:55:49] <sheetjs> GreenJello: you meant to send that to KevinX
[04:55:49] <GreenJello> .map(obj => ({ ...obj, foo: 'bar' }))
[04:56:28] <GreenJello> didn't want moldorcoder7 to run off with not quite right code

[06:24:53] <domhnall> Hi, backing up a bit with my coding and just tried `let x, y = 2, 5`  I recall being able to do this is JS, but maybe I'm mistaken about the syntax?
[06:25:04] <domhnall> s/is/in
[06:27:26] <silly_> n> const [x, y] = [2, 5]; ({ x, y })

[06:27:43] <silly_> n> 1,2
[06:27:43] <jellobot> (okay) 2
[06:29:10] <silly_> your example is valid syntax, initializing x with value undefined, y = 2, and the line "returns 5", but i don't know how exactly the comma operator works
[06:29:33] <silly_> or what it's good for
[06:30:13] <domhnall> silly, okay. Yeah, I've been away from JS and doing Python so maybe that was just me thinking in different 'context'.
[06:31:03] <silly_> before destructuring became a thing you had to do `var x = 2, y =5;`
[06:32:09] <domhnall> hmm... okay that's what I wanted.

[16:08:30] <silly_> !const @Kingsy
[16:08:30] <jellobot> Kingsy, When transpiling or on node 6+, always use `const`. If you can't avoid reassigning the variable (try!), use `let`. Never use `var` unless you are relying on !hoisting (which you shouldn't be).

[17:24:24] <domhnall> masoudd: well, firstly, DHTML isn't just html and css, it's also JS and the DOM. secondly, usually, the id is set as a key (using React) or some other framework. where you'd 'dynamically' fill the id property via some form of looping/mapping.  Since this is JS, and that code doesn't have any JS to comment on, I'll leave it at that.

[20:34:00] <domhnall> ah, I see in the comment
[20:34:02] <masoudd> domhnall, I have the {fname1: "john", lname1: "doe", fname2: "foo", lname2: "bar", ...} object that is close to what I want. It feels a little hacky to just parse lname2 for example to lname and 2 to turn it into [{fname: "john", lname: "doe"}, {fname: "foo", lname: "bar"}]. I was wondering if there is a better way to get to this final array

[22:48:36] <GreenJello> so the values in a FormData can apparently be a File in addition to a string https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormDataEntryValue
[22:49:05] *** Sven_vB_ is now known as Sven_vB
[22:49:13] <sheetjs> its really cool GreenJello, you can assemble files in the browser and send them back
[22:49:38] <hassoon> GreenJello: sure why not
[22:49:51] <hassoon> ajax-based files submission
[22:50:11] <sheetjs> it's been feasible for at least 4 years

[22:52:16] <GreenJello> type checks on the playground
[22:53:09] <GreenJello> might be possible with filter instead of flatMap
[22:53:18] *** Quits: killown (~killown@user/killown) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[22:53:33] <buu> GreenJello: does flatmap let you remove empty arrays?
[22:54:06] <GreenJello> if you return [] then it's like filtering out the item
[22:54:13] <buu> yeah
[22:54:21] <buu> very perlish
[22:55:10] <silly_> binary data in forms isn't new, is it? i thought you could upload images with forms even in the 90ies
[22:55:16] <GreenJello> more rust than perl
[22:55:40] <buu> GreenJello: perl is older so it wins
[22:55:46] <buu> silly_: sure
[22:55:51] <buu> silly_: but you didn't have js access to them
[22:55:57] <silly_> oh
[22:56:09] <buu> (I'm pretty sure you had js access to forms pre 2017 but I don't care enough to figure it out)

[22:56:21] <GreenJello> it's filter-mapping to a more specific type, which is only really a pattern when you have static type checking
[22:56:37] <buu> GreenJello: I meant the returning [] from a map part!
[22:57:03] *** Quits: fef (~thedawn@user/thedawn) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:57:28] <GreenJello> ah, yeah, because JS doesn't have an Option/Maybe type for some reason
[22:57:41] <GreenJello> I'll admit it's not pretty
[22:57:47] <buu> A common perl idiom is map { $x->isa(Y) ? foo($x) : () } to filtermap
[22:58:28] <mikrosis> And the magic method is...    Object.is !!!
[22:59:46] <buu> What exactly does typeof work on
[23:00:02] <GreenJello> mikrosis, that compares objects by identity
[23:00:16] <GreenJello> not their contE
[23:00:23] <GreenJello> not their contents
[23:00:34] <silly_> from mdn: Object.is([], []);                // false
[23:00:40] <buu> minus 10 points from the house of mikrosis
