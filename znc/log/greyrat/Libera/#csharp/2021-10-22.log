[00:00:02] <Suchiman> MizMahem: it can't, it's a ref struct, converting to the interface would box, moving it to the heap which is illegal
[00:00:25] <MizMahem> oh, doh, of course.
[00:01:00] <Suchiman> MizMahem: it does provide a GetEnumerator() however which makes foreach work which is pattern based and not interface based

[00:06:19] <MizMahem> Suchiman: hmm... there wouldn't be such a thing as a Pattern based extension would there? hmm...

[00:17:57] <MizMahem> asked this before, still curious. Is there a reason why LINQ has a aggregate method with a built in selector? Is there an optimization I'm not aware of you can apply if you know how you want to select the result while you aggregate?
[00:19:38] <Suchiman> MizMahem: what you mean?
[00:19:39] <MizMahem> hmm, doesn't look like it: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/426e1d9f7bca628056e38261cd80bec38e59ca79/src/libraries/System.Linq/src/System/Linq/Aggregate.cs#L60
[00:19:43] <MizMahem> just one of those things I guess.
[00:20:20] <Suchiman> ah, the resultSelector you mean
[00:20:44] <MizMahem> Suchiman: well I mean it's presence made me curious. I'm a dummy, but AFAIK doing the `Aggregate` method with the result selector should be equivalent to just doing `Aggregate().Select()`
[00:20:55] <MizMahem> so I wondered if there was some optimization I was missing
[00:21:14] <Suchiman> MizMahem: not even that
[00:21:30] <Suchiman> MizMahem: it would just be `.Aggregate(...).Property`
[00:21:40] <MizMahem> oh, yeah, sure.
[00:22:23] <Suchiman> MizMahem: although the advantage is that you can have x => x * 10 while writing (.Aggregate(...) * 10).Whatever() is kindof awkward to write
[00:23:05] <MizMahem> hmm, I suppose I guess.

[03:48:13] <Suchiman> MizMahem: are you even sure it's stack and not register :P ?
[03:48:59] <MizMahem> it's all black magic to me.
[03:49:01] <Suchiman> MizMahem: but yeah stack allocations are incredibly cheap, the amount doesn't even really matter, when the method enters, a pre calculated amount of stack space is allocated with a single instruction for all stack variables
[03:49:56] <Suchiman> (unless you're using dynamic stack allocations in the form of `Span<bytes> bytes = stackalloc byte[nonConstVariable]`, that involves more complex, expensive machinery
[03:52:33] *** Quits: sysRPN (~sysRPN@097-101-210-085.res.spectrum.com) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[03:53:23] <Suchiman> (which is why coreclr/runtime pretty much always uses a constant number like `Span<bytes> bytes = stackalloc byte[512]`, even if that's oversized, because that's still cheaper)
[03:59:14] <Slade> its interesting to me how many modern developers don't understand heap vs stack vs register
[03:59:39] <MizMahem> Suchiman: hmm, I would expect that even with `byte[nonConst]` it would still just like move the stackpointer forward the size of `nonConst`. But you are saying something more complex happens?
[03:59:55] <MizMahem> well, move forward `nonConst * sizeof(byte)`
[04:00:39] <MizMahem> lol well I suppose that statement is kind of nonsensical :p
[04:01:34] <Suchiman> MizMahem: well the compiler sums up all required stack space in encodes it as an immediate to bump the stack pointer, but it can only do that for all static / const allocations for the method. A dynamically sized allocation requires bumping the stack pointer a second time in the middle of the method (which otherwise only happens the prologue) and then that needs to be accounted in the epilogue of the method before returning
[04:02:21] <MizMahem> oh I see what you mean
[04:02:31] <MizMahem> because the `Span` itself takes up some space.
[04:02:37] <Suchiman> MizMahem: no
[04:02:43] <Suchiman> MizMahem: the Span is a struct of fixed size
[04:02:44] <MizMahem> oh, well I don't see what you mean :p
[04:03:11] <Suchiman> but the stack allocation that returns a pointer to n number of bytes happens only sometime later during the execution of the method
[04:03:56] <Suchiman> let's ignore that there's Span involved, just think of the old way, `byte* ptr = stackalloc byte[variable]`
[04:04:13] <Suchiman> it only knows the nubmer of bytes required from variable once that line is reached
[04:04:35] <Suchiman> which requires bumping the stack pointer at that line (instead of in the prologue) and then resetting the stackpointer to the correct value in the epilogue

[04:07:03] <MizMahem> so is this a static vs non-static thing?

[04:12:40] <Suchiman> MizMahem: you can see that it precomputed it will need 0x60 stack bytes so it allocates them with the second instruction "L0001: sub rsp, 0x60" and frees them just before leaving "L007a: add rsp, 0x60"

[04:21:36] <MizMahem> okay thanks this helps a lot. So really I'm probably not even avoiding anything by avoiding a stack allocation, since likely in the prolog the space was already accounted for in a static way such that it doesn't really matter how many (constant size) variables I declare.

[13:13:32] <bomb> yeah I thought it was dumb when Brandon Lee was killed in 1994
[13:13:50] <interop_madness> like, there is an armory at the film set and you have to get the gun there and you have to explicitly state "please do not put live ammunition designed to kill people in the gun, instead put blanks in it"?
[13:14:17] <MizMahem> I mean, shit happens.
[13:14:28] <interop_madness> and then this MAYBE happens, so the guy maybe follows the request, but a live bullet might still reside in the chamber?
[13:14:31] <bomb> it's an ancient gun. a real one
[13:14:37] <MizMahem> I suspect an obstruction in the barrel or something is the cause though.

[13:19:02] <interop_madness> but I guess the screen actors guild now has to inform all their members: "if you are given a prop gun, you completely disarm it, empty the chamber, inspect every bullet personally to make sure it's a blank, then have the guy who gave you the gun do the same (while you watch) then, in writing have this guy confirm to you that all bullets are blanks, then have the guy (not you) fire a shot at a target to make sure the barrel is
[13:19:03] <interop_madness> not obstructed - if it should be and the gun explodes, it's the guy's hand that's torn off, not yours - and ONLY THEN do you fire on a fellow actor on a film set"

[13:22:14] <bomb> it will help interop's hapiness, obviously
[13:22:16] <MatthiasVance> Also even if they are blanks, they can still be dangerous right

[13:22:44] <bomb> Brandon Lee's death was also from a blank
[13:22:47] <MizMahem> you are suggesting people go to jail, how is that going to prevent such a thing from happening?
[13:23:02] <interop_madness> so the lack of institutional oversight is where someone signed off on using blanks to begin with?
[13:23:10] <MatthiasVance> interop_madness: "While blanks are less dangerous than live ammunition, they are far from harmless, and can in fact be fatal. Beside the hot combustion gases, any objects in the cartridge itself (like wadding or a bullet-shaped plug keeping the propellant in place) or the barrel will be propelled at high velocity and cause injury or death at close range."
[13:23:30] <shadowchaser> and as to how, you can also kill somebody with a blank if you'll put the muzzle to his head and shoot
[13:23:33] <interop_madness> MizMahem, prison for murder doesn't prevent murder either, not an argument
[13:23:51] <shadowchaser> there was such accident in poland in wwII reconstruction event
[13:23:57] *** Joins: cn--j (~cn-j@user/cn-j)
[13:23:58] <MatthiasVance> However: For movie use, specially designed blank-firing firearms are often used, which increases the margin of safety as they cannot be loaded with live ammunition. 5-in-1 blanks are specifically made for theatrical use and are commonly used in real firearms for dramatic effect. 5-in-1 blanks can function in a variety of different calibres, hence the name.
[13:24:32] <interop_madness> there are EXACTLY two options
[13:24:33] <MizMahem> interop_madness: I mean, you are the one saying prison can improve the situation, not me.
[13:24:59] <interop_madness> 1. there is a safe way to handle guns with blanks in a movie scene. then there is lack of oversight on how those were handled, killing a person. prison.
[13:25:10] <jbe> well, it's harder to get someone shot on set if you're in prison I suppose
[13:25:39] <jbe> but of course, what'd help more is making sure no-one else dies in a similar fashion in the future
[13:25:40] <interop_madness> 2. there is no safe way to handle guns with blanks in a movie scene. then thhere is lack of oversight in greenlighting the use of a gun with blanks against a living person. prison.
[13:26:04] * MizMahem shakes their head.
[13:26:05] <interop_madness> point I'm making, manslaughter appies
[13:26:45] <cn--j> Is base.foo() actually foo(this), but a different version of the foo method is invoked due to "base", i.e. it's just a keyword that triggers the original implementation of foo that's still saved somewhere in the derived class?
[13:27:03] <jbe> I doubt it goes higher than wrongful death tbh
[13:27:16] <MizMahem> I doubt it becomes a criminal matter at all.
[13:27:20] <MizMahem> But we'll see I suppose.
[13:28:07] <Jonopoly> So this is the new c# home!
[13:29:52] <MizMahem> cn--j: mm, as I understand it, it's not so much like the original implementation being 'saved' somewhere, as it is like, well every method you declare is in memory somewhere right? So normally when you call a method it says "go here and run this code with this data."

[13:33:38] <Jonopoly> bomb: me too, me too! I'm currently at work and we've got a project that uses .net framework
[13:34:01] <bomb> Jonopoly: cool cool, which version of .NET?
[13:34:06] <Jonopoly> and i've been given the task to create a .net 5 API which is going to be ...fun
[13:34:13] <Jonopoly> I believe its 4.6
[13:34:19] <Jonopoly> or 4.6.1
[13:34:20] <bomb> 4.6?
[13:34:26] <bomb> now you're putting our friendship in danger Jonopoly
[13:34:31] <Jonopoly> haha
[13:34:40] <Jonopoly> Hey! We're meant to be migrating it to .net core 5
[13:34:46] <Jonopoly> you can only imagine how pain free that is
[13:34:48] <MizMahem> cn--j: where it gets really confusing is when you overide an autoproperty. Then the "hidden" variable really is stashed someplace. Don't ask me to explain how that works except it is :p
[13:35:01] <bomb> heh, .NET 6 is coming in a few weeks
[13:35:43] <Jonopoly> Well.. moving to .net 5 should make .net 6 easier i imagine
[13:35:45] <Jonopoly> surely...
[13:35:49] * Jonopoly praying
[13:37:23] <bomb> .NET 4.8 is good to go until like 2026. jus' sayin' :)
[13:37:35] <biberu> Jonopoly: depending on how it's structured you might want to get it to 4.8, then start moving projects to standard 2.0 so that they can be referenced from both framework and core/5/6, hopefully that doesn't leave too much code in the api project itself, then you could replace that part last
[13:38:09] <Jonopoly> Well i've been giving the freedom to write the api in .net 5
[13:38:10] <biberu> Jonopoly: see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard
[13:38:58] <Jonopoly> biberu: So you're saying main project that's 4.6.1 would be worth moving to .net core 2.0 ?

[13:39:53] <Jonopoly> Thanks well we've got a lot of logic in controllers but we're meant to be following MVVP sturcture
[13:40:07] <Jonopoly> feels like a bit of a mix of MVVP and MVC which is nice :)
[13:40:33] <biberu> Jonopoly: maybe you have a bunch of projects that this api is using that are also targeting framework, if those can be migrated to standard you could then use them from the new api in 5 too, without rewriting them at the same time
[13:40:49] <Jonopoly> *MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
[13:40:51] <MizMahem> cn--j: anyways, I can't claim to really understand it, but my (bad) understanding though is that like every Class has a pointer to its table of methods. Additionally, class that inherit (that is like, every object in C# I guess) have a table of pointers to that objects methods. And so on up the chain as necessary back to object.
[13:41:08] <Jonopoly> ah right i see biberu
[13:41:28] <MizMahem> which method gets called depends then on how you bind it. Like are you overriding, calling base, doing nothing? Whatever.
[13:41:31] <Jonopoly> Yeah that's the idea really.. the API will replace a lot of database logic from main projects etc..
[13:42:30] <biberu> Jonopoly: that way you could rewrite just the api layer, which should ideally be pretty thin, and once the new api is up and running and you don't need the old code to run on framework anymore you could start moving the dependencies to 5/6 to take advantage of new features in those too
[13:49:58] <Jonopoly> biberu: That sounds better really, atm its just seperate because old project isn't migrating yet

[16:19:53] <BSaboia> MatthiasVance, IT
[16:20:48] <MatthiasVance> BSaboia: I don't know of any websites, but I wonder if it would be any different than just searching for "a job in IT"?
[16:21:04] <MatthiasVance> And then mentioning whatever accommodations they need
[16:21:35] <BSaboia> It would be nice if it's like that, but it's not. He cannot move properly, so there is a lot of constraints
[16:22:44] <BSaboia> So it needs to be a truly remote job, for a starter. And then he could perhaps go on premises once in a long while

[16:35:36] <MatthiasVance> BSaboia: Okay so the conclusion is just that companies suck? What country is this btw
[16:36:05] <MatthiasVance> BSaboia: My expectation was, you find a remote job, you notify them of anything they need to do to accommodate you, you interview, you are a match, you start working

[17:49:24] <Nasp> lz_:  Well ml.net can use tensorflow i think
[17:49:38] <lz_> maybe, I don't know, it's a giant mess
[17:50:02] <MatthiasVance> shit, EF Core supports specifying FillFactor for indices, but not for PK? :(
[17:50:10] <lz_> I wanted to die everytime I tried to use ml
[17:50:16] <Nasp> Fillfactor?
[17:50:20] <Nasp> So there is extra space in the pages
[17:50:36] <Nasp> Didn't knew EF could
[17:52:25] <MatthiasVance> Yeah for index, but not for PK
[17:52:27] <MatthiasVance> whaaat
[17:52:31] <MatthiasVance> And they closed the issue
[17:53:42] <Nasp> :D
[17:53:42] <MatthiasVance> Let's see if manually fiddling with the metadata does something
[17:53:52] <Nasp> I still feel like EFCore is missing a lot of those smaller features
[17:54:01] <Nasp> I'm also still missing table hints
[17:56:18] <MatthiasVance> fuck adding it manually didn't work, need a custom migration :(
[17:57:19] <MatthiasVance> Boo
[17:57:22] <MatthiasVance> This blocks me
[17:58:12] <Nasp> Btw what do you prefer, attributes or fluent config for EF?
[17:58:51] <MatthiasVance> fluent, to keep it all in "one place"
[17:59:00] <MatthiasVance> I scaffolded everything from DB now
[17:59:18] <MatthiasVance> But when writing it manually I do it in a separate file
[17:59:53] <Nasp> Yeah i prefer fluent to keep it in one place as well
[18:00:02] <Nasp> But i have colleguess who disagrees and even mix it
[18:00:28] <Nasp> And it's so much harder when you have to look at the different entities to figure out what is indexed and what is not
[18:00:39] <Nasp> You do db firt?
[18:01:36] <MatthiasVance> What is firt? (probably not then xD)
[18:02:05] <MatthiasVance> I don't get to use EF often, but here they made a mess of the DB so scaffolding from production and then fixing all the discrepancies
[18:02:28] <MatthiasVance> And I just run migrations from the Startup since there's only one host :P One problem at a time
[18:02:46] <canton7> "db first"  I assume
[18:03:49] <MatthiasVance> ah

[22:05:23] <BSaboia> bomb, nice
[22:05:26] <ezio> bomb, no.  Quite lucid.  Just remembering what a pain in the as WPF was.
[22:05:50] <BSaboia> It sounds nice for prototyping and console apps, but I am not sure if that's a good idea generally speaking
[22:06:06] <BSaboia> But surely it makes the code looks leaner, something like python
[22:06:46] <jonp> how do "console apps" enter that picture?
[22:08:48] <BSaboia> jonp, because it's more frequent on a console app that you want a lean main class. You often don't need to clutter it with Console.WriteLine; the context is obvious enough
[22:09:12] <jonp> it's not just Console that is part of those "implicit usings"
[22:09:22] <jonp> System, System.Collections.Generic, etc. are all part of the default import set
[22:12:21] <BSaboia> jonp, I know. What I mean is that it's more frequent that you want to omit that on a Console app. Perhaps I am wrong, but that's how I see it
[22:12:56] <BSaboia> When prototyping or writing a simple console app, I don't need to be explicit. It doesn't gives a lot of value. But that's the same as for generic collections, as you pointed
