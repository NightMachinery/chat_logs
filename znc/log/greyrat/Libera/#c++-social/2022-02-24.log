[15:01:39] <Carbonflux> this is reminding me of WW1, all kinds of interlocking alliances leading to a cascade effect.
[15:03:08] <Carbonflux> makes me wonder if Ukraine kept any nukes stashed away.
[15:05:15] <Oxyd> Makes me wonder if NATO has grown any balls, or if we'll reach a second Munich agreement any time soon.
[15:08:12] <Carbonflux> I think Biden will lend his balls, he seems to want this fight, there is a real "hatred" of Russia in the democratic leadership here. He is waiting for Russia to step on a trigger that will let him act. imho.
[15:10:55] <Carbonflux> i am starting to think the nuclear "deterrent" of the cold war is almost meaningless, all sides know they won't use nukes, which might enable big ground wars,
[15:12:57] <Carbonflux> everyone has got a lot of new hardware they want to try out and they are tried of nukes getting in the way of their old time games.
[15:37:00] <Renderwww> I wouldn't have even noticed there was a happening going on if you guys hadn't talked about it

[15:39:20] <Renderwww> can't be serious if it's only a couple of percentage points
[15:42:05] <Carbonflux> well, hopefully you will remain uneffected, that last thing anyone needs is another war. We should be colonizing the solar system, finding wonders and enacting grand visions of big science.
