[00:00:46] <euouae> Guest27 I'm not sure, try things. renaming branches and creating new branches won't leave you in an unrecoverable state

[00:07:08] <Guest27> euouae ok i did rename the branch to old-jekyll and renamed the new one to main but now when i try to push it it tells me i need to pull first
[00:07:17] <Guest27> but i dont want to pull
[00:07:35] <Guest27> i want it to override everything
[00:07:54] <Guest27> by everything i mean the main branch
[00:09:46] <cbreak> Guest27: force push then
[00:11:53] <euouae> so I don't get it, when I make a PR , the commits get new hashes after gh repo accepts them?
[00:12:03] <euouae> Or what is my confusion? ugh I'm so confused

Because several commits modified the file, it is producing different .patch files for each commit which did. I'd like to merge them all into one without doing it manually, if possible.
