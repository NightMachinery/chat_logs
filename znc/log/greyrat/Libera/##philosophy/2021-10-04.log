[01:20:10] <brownorange> i think (a or not a) is not a tautology.
[01:20:48] <brownorange> specifically when 'or' is understood to be inclusive-or
[01:25:04] <Vohveli> in what case is it not true?
[01:26:29] <brownorange> when truth density of 'a' is greater than 0% and less than 100%
[01:27:56] <Vohveli> so never?
[01:29:09] <brownorange> (a and !b and c and d and !e)   has a truth density of 3.125 %
[01:29:54] <brownorange> its negation, !(a and !b and c and d and !e),  only has a truth density of 96.875%
[01:30:12] <brownorange> neither forms are true, so inclusive-or operation should not return true
[01:33:15] <brownorange> you can see my dilemma
[01:34:04] <brownorange> inclusive-or cannot handle this situation
[01:34:50] <Vohveli> are a,b,c,d,e atomic? I assumed "a" was atomic in the first one
[01:36:04] <brownorange> ((a and !b and c and d and !e) or !(a and !b and c and d and !e)) is an instantiation of (a or not a)
[01:36:35] <brownorange> (a and !b and c and d and !e) is substituting in for 'a'
[01:38:20] <brownorange> in my opinion l.e.m is just wrong in this scenario
[01:38:53] <Vohveli> so "a" was not atomic in the first one, but everything in the other proposition is atomic?
[01:39:32] <brownorange> these are propositional variables
[01:40:01] <Vohveli> then how do you determine the truth density?
[01:40:18] <brownorange> truth table. number of rows true divided over the number of rows total
[01:41:09] <brownorange> https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=truth+table+%28a+and+%21b+and+c+and+d+and+%21e%29

[01:43:13] <Vohveli> (a or not a) has a truth density of 1
[01:43:35] <brownorange> I disagree on that , l.e.m is wrong
[01:44:10] <Vohveli> well, just write the table
[01:44:29] <brownorange> if 'a' isn't 100% or 0% true, negating it certainly doesn't give you 0 or 100%
[01:44:45] <brownorange> the numbers i quoted before capture this reality
[01:45:32] <Vohveli> this isn't boolean logic then? should've stated that first
[01:45:35] <brownorange> (a and !b and c and d and !e)   has a truth density of 3.125 %,  but   !(a and !b and c and d and !e) has 96.875% .  both short of 100%
[01:46:15] <brownorange> Vohveli this is about propositional calculus/boolean logic/boolean algebra whatever .
[01:46:30] <brownorange> for example you can't prove (a and !b and c and d and !e)  , just as you can't prove !(a and !b and c and d and !e)
[01:46:41] <Vohveli> not if your truth values are something else than true or false
[01:46:55] <brownorange> so the assertion of (a or not a), is or shouldn't be a tautology
[01:47:31] <brownorange> Vohveli it is recognized in classic logic that you can have wffs that aren't tautologies and aren't falsities.
[01:47:48] <Vohveli> okay, show me an instantion of the variables that makes it false
[01:47:56] <Vohveli> *instantiation
[01:48:00] <brownorange> of (a or not a)?
[01:48:07] <Vohveli> yes
[01:48:28] <brownorange> that should be:  ((a and !b and c and d and !e) or !(a and !b and c and d and !e))
[01:48:57] <Vohveli> sure, that works too
[01:49:10] <brownorange> since neither operand is true, the inclusive-or operator which tests if one or both are true, should in fact return false, or no specific truth value at all.
[01:49:20] <Vohveli> which instantiation makes it false?
[01:49:35] <brownorange> ah
[01:50:12] <brownorange> i believe it is false in one circumstance, but not all
[01:50:32] <brownorange> so i can't say it is false, but i know the generalization it makes can't be TRUE
[01:52:12] <Vohveli> well, it's simple to see that (a or not a) follows from either (a) or (not a)

[02:08:09] <Digit> methinks (a and/or not a), at least hints at the potential for seemingly paradoxical states of simultaneous is and is not.  better yet methinks would be something to open up to possibilities that are more enticingly elaborative and opening, rather than final and closed.  idk where that fits into a truth table.  ... been thinking non-linear hyperdimensional notions since mentioning paradox resolution and remembering where i got that

[02:08:30] <brownorange> My point would be that although (a or not a) necessarily follows from 'a' as well as '!a', this is precisely because one or the other is assumed

[02:12:41] <Vohveli> yes
[02:12:57] <brownorange> I would claim it only does so for the same reason that 'a' alone has a 50% truth density
[02:13:36] <brownorange> (a or not a) only makes sense until you realize 'a' can be something that doesn't fit tautology or falsity
[02:14:13] <Vohveli> I realized it with all possible values
[02:14:14] <brownorange> the negation or thereof a truth density greater than 0 and less than 100, shouldn't land you true in either case
[02:15:44] <Vohveli> the negation does not operate on truth densities, it operates on truth values
[02:16:09] <brownorange> of which there is no fixed value until you interpret
[02:16:09] <Vohveli> all realizations (all two of them) lead to (a or not a) being true
[02:16:10] <Digit> necessarily, assumed, i'm not entirely convinced of either not being, sorta, circularly reasoned by the ol bootstrapping bias of the method.  but i cant readily point to clear ways out of that loop, if there is such a loop.   "is" makes my philosophy gland itchy.  maybe salve.
[02:16:53] <brownorange> Vohveli how do you know which to pick?
[02:17:14] <Vohveli> I didn't pick either, I considered both cases
[02:18:14] <brownorange> ((a and !b and c and d and !e) or !(a and !b and c and d and !e)) this itself is a tautology. but i'm still suspicious.
[02:19:07] <brownorange> Vohveli you can interpret a single variable as true/false, but to interpret an entire formula made up of many variables, you have to admit it's arbitrary what you assign
[02:20:29] <Vohveli> how is it arbitrary? every connective is unambiguously defined

[02:26:49] <brownorange> No really this is good news. I can go back to grappling with undecidables
[02:29:46] <Digit> brownorange: could there not be instances where either side of a or not a would (intrinsically or optionally) invert/alter the interpretation lopsidedly?  and with or without that, /is/ it inevitable true/false would always pop out?  i'm straining to see how that inevitability's been derived.
[02:31:49] <Digit> i also wonder how much such binary simplifications utility has shaped our linguistic evolution, perhaps such that we're mislead and impeded from seeing or at least communicating beyond that conceptual bubble.
[02:31:50] <brownorange> Digit, in the case where you have (a or not a), a substitution done to one variable on one side must be the same one done to the other. so as you pump out the truth you can always predict one side is true/false and the other is just the negation
[02:33:16] <brownorange> if this was (a or b) it would be a different story, as you are more free to do different substitutions
[02:33:19] <Digit> idk, i still imagine there can be intrinsic qualities of specifics not revealed by this generalisation, that would not require substitutions to acheive lopsided interpretation.
[02:34:12] <Digit> maybe indeed, blurred lines between what's !a and b.
[02:34:47] <Digit> then a case of chasing it down with the method.   still cant see out of it from here.

[03:19:18] <Rashad> What's physical logic?
[03:20:07] <brownorange> what's metaphysical logic then?
[03:20:23] <evolv> metaphysics that's logical
[03:20:26] <evolv> duh
[03:21:42] <Rashad> Physics deals with specific objects like electrons and protons and stars, etc.
[03:22:04] <Rashad> Metaphysics deals with what is common in all existents, with existence itself.
[03:22:43] <Rashad> Physics lists the properties like charge and mass and studies them, metaphysics deals with what is an object and what is a property.
[03:23:22] <Rashad> Therefore metaphysics cannot be studied empirically it has to be studied logically or axiomatically.
[03:23:59] <Rashad> The rule of metaphysics is this: If something is to exist, it has to exist /as something/, as something in particular, as something with certain inherent properties.
[03:24:05] <brownorange> sounds as if metaphysics is the study-of and the studied?
[03:24:26] <Rashad> This is called the law of identity or "A is A".
[03:24:52] <Rashad> If you fill your car with water but water your plants with gasoline, then you are misidentifying both.
[03:25:21] <Rashad> A tree is a tree and a car is a car. The properties of a tree cannot be changed without destroying the tree.
[03:25:26] <Rashad> And same for the car.
[03:25:44] <evolv> but how much you have to destroy for it not to be a tree is unknown
[03:25:57] <brownorange> Rashad, if i remove the seatbelts from a car, does it spontaneously combust into not-car ness?
[03:26:12] <Rashad> No.
[03:26:18] <Rashad> You have to remove the essential properties.
[03:26:35] <Rashad> A car is a "compound" thing so it is harder to give it a single strong identity.
[03:26:47] <Rashad> But consider the table of elements from chemistry.
[03:27:17] <Rashad> The concept of "holy water" implies that there is water that is H2O that is different from other water that is also H2O.
[03:28:01] <Rashad> Or there are people who will tell you that "Himalayan Salt" is special, when in fact it is just NaCl.
[03:28:04] <evolv> that is why process metaphysics is the only true metaphysics
[03:28:04] <evolv> :D
[03:29:22] <brownorange> more and more i think i would have saved so much time just letting a computer program figure metamathematics for me
[03:32:00] <evolv> you'd need a few hundreds of thousands of quantum processors, I'm sure
[03:32:15] <evolv> then you'd get 1% output from your model
[03:32:31] <Rashad> Identity also plays a role in morality. Remember from Animal Farm where one of the animals declares that "some animals are more equal than others."
[03:32:43] <evolv> no, I haven't read it
[03:32:47] <Rashad> Meaning that although they have the same properties, they can have different rights.
[03:33:15] <evolv> more accurately, I remember other people quoting that line
[03:34:26] <brownorange> evolv, it's quite hard to keep all the layers organized. but i'm not sure it's computationally an issue for computers to do so
[03:35:08] <evolv> depends on your model
[03:36:19] <evolv> probably a solid GPU supercomputing cluster depending on what exactly you're doing, I imagine
[03:36:38] <brownorange> i've spent a ton of time arguing with people on chicken and egg issues regarding formal systems
[03:37:32] <brownorange> and with the proof != truth stuff, it just gets so tiresome. especially since no one has a single view of how statements belong to a formal system or another. where a statement really lives seems always in question
[03:37:56] <brownorange> people seem to refer to a statement by what they know or think of it, rather than where it lives
[03:38:24] <evolv> silly serious
[03:38:29] <evolv> what if it lives in your heart
[03:38:32] <Rashad> If you're into OOP, physics would be Classes, for example an Electron Class lists the type of properties of all electrons (charge, weight, etc). While metaphysics would describe the valid syntax for writing a class.
[03:39:11] <Rashad> The law of identity says, among others, that no property can have two values at the same time.
[03:39:21] <Rashad> The charge cannot be -1 and +4 at the same time.
[03:39:49] <Rashad> Quantum physics poses challenges to this model by saying that things can be waves and particles, here and there, etc, at the same time.
[03:40:03] <evolv> so is metaphysics like working backwards from assumptions further down the nodes of the philosophy tree?
[03:40:39] <Rashad> evolv Yes it discusses that which applies to all objects regardless of their particular properties.
[03:41:38] <Rashad> evolv While a class applies to all those objects with these particular properties regardless of their particular values.
[03:43:02] <Rashad> In the class the values are omitted (say if it is a car, then its color or position or speed etc), while in metaphysics the properties themselves are omitted, and what is left is the rules to write them: there can't be two properties with the same name (i.e., the same property cannot have two values), etc.
[03:43:58] <evolv> incorporating quantum physics would just make what is already assumption based into a probabilistic model, which is already what it is
[03:44:13] <evolv> and then incorporiates Bayes or maximum likelihood
[03:44:15] <evolv> and/or
[03:44:17] <Rashad> The law of identity cannot be reached empirically, and indeed empirically its current status among most physicists is that it has been falsified.
[03:44:40] <evolv> although this appears to be Bayesian
[03:46:22] <Rashad> The crisis of metaphysics cannot be solved by mathematical logic.
[03:46:33] <Rashad> It has to be solved by another metaphysics.

[03:52:04] <Rashad> If it changes from one form of matter to another well defined form, then that's no problem. The problem is when it remains H2O and remains at the same temperature yet behave differently.
[03:53:23] <evolv> ah, so if all conditions remain the same, the conditioned properties that is liquid water shouldn't have abberent behavior
[03:53:59] <Rashad> This idea of behaving differently while being the same is found in Quantum Physics.
[03:54:23] <Rashad> The same electron will behave differently and even randomly if you repeat the experiment.
[03:54:38] <Rashad> Repeat the same exact experiment.
[03:55:11] <Rashad> One response was that there is an extra property we don't know that is deciding the outcome (a hidden variable theory), but that didn't work out as expected.
[03:55:36] <evolv> or that the wave interacts with itself
[03:55:47] <Rashad> However it is a common myth on the internet that Von Neumann proved that hidden variable theories cannot exist.
[03:55:49] <evolv> as one of the many theories
[03:56:00] <evolv> yeah, I've seen that
[03:56:10] <Rashad> He did propose a proof and for a while it was accepted, but with the work of John Bell he showed that the proof is flawed.
[03:57:01] <Rashad> There is also the theory of Bohm/De Broigle that proposes a physical wave that accompanies the particle, where both are real and deterministic.
[03:57:48] <Rashad> It gives the same predictions as the "classical" quantum mechanics (i.e., that of the 20s before QED), but unfortunately does not predict more than it.
[03:57:54] *** Quits: pucara (~i@181.111.22.195) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[03:58:19] <Rashad> Plus combining it with special relativity is not as straight forward as with classical quantum mechanics
[03:59:01] <evolv> silly not serious but fun: perhaps the reducible form of free will is at the wave
[04:00:22] <Rashad> Free will is better studied at the level of biology. Volition (the experience of wanting to move your arm then "doing something" to move it) is the same as the concept of a mutation at the level of the DNA.
[04:00:22] <evolv> I suspect I may have accidentally brought up quantum consciousness
[04:00:52] <Rashad> On the level of the DNA a mutation means a split path where it either ends up enhancing survival chances or hindering them.
[04:01:02] <evolv> it may not be better studied given the flaws of modern mechanics, though
[04:01:05] <Rashad> It is the same with choice and volition, but on the level of consciousness.
[04:02:03] <Rashad> In fact consider this parallel astonishingly accurate: most mutations are useless, and also most volitional acts can be useless or of very little importance.
[04:02:24] <Rashad> For example scratching your nose when there is no need to or singing in the shower, etc.
[04:02:53] <evolv> heh, in Buddhism those would be considered of great importance because of attachment to form

[04:03:05] <Rashad> There is however major decisions that will split the path of the organism either towards better survival or great harm, like say the decision to join the mafia or not, or the decision to eat a wild mushroom or not.
[04:03:07] <evolv> every decision matter in that sense
[04:03:11] <evolv> but I get what you mean
[04:03:54] <Rashad> I haven't read Darwin but from my general impression of modern evolutionary biology I am not anyone is talking about survival on the level of consciousness.
[04:04:12] <Rashad> In fact most people would try to explain away consciousness based on the DNA level.
[04:04:13] <evolv> that was my field of study
[04:04:23] <evolv> and I've read Darwin, my recommendation is: don't
[04:04:27] <evolv> he's dull
[04:04:36] <Rashad> Even his work on emotions?
[04:04:49] <evolv> I've only read Origin of Species and Descent of Man
[04:04:56] <evolv> so maybe he's not dull there
[04:06:24] <evolv> try to explain away consciousness on the DNA level in which way?

[04:07:52] <evolv> as in, DNA is responsible for neurodevelopment which causes consciousness?
[04:09:47] <Rashad> evolv They try to explain consciousness as an almost "undesirable" product of evolution rather than a whole new mechanism for it
[04:10:45] <Rashad> It is even possible to say that changes in consciousness are inheritable through parenting.
[04:11:46] <evolv> it's a good argument
[04:12:48] <evolv> like, it's necessary, but it's resource heavy. That would explain why routines reduce consciousness as the routine codifies behaviors into the automatic machinery
[04:13:04] <evolv> hence most accidents occur near people's homes
[04:13:44] <evolv> routine habits, that is
[04:13:56] <evolv> less resource heavy, faster
[04:14:11] <Rashad> That is quite true.
[04:15:40] <Rashad> That's also maybe why robots that cannot change their own code and are fully automatic/routine-like are screwed in the wild.

[04:17:14] <Rashad> And if we discover a theory of everything that we could calculate fast enough for ordinary and all situations, then we can automate all our actions in routines and this will be the most important point in human history.
[04:17:30] <evolv> yeah, but even if they could change their code, if they were efficient at it, it'd look no different
[04:17:34] <Rashad> There will be no choices to make, you will always know what is the best option to take.
[04:17:35] <evolv> it's like consciousness requires error
[04:17:59] <evolv> it makes me think of a study where creative people tend to have poorer memories
[04:18:19] <evolv> I never looked into the study, itself, just an article so I cannot vouch for the evidence, but it's interesting to think about
[04:18:33] <evolv> creativity occurs because of poorer fidelity of memory
[04:20:14] <evolv> yet creative people function generally well as any other person, so we can still apply general models of human behavior to them. Perhaps that is true of whatever is happening of the quantum level
[04:20:22] <evolv> "errors" of the natural universe
[04:20:34] <evolv> or to put another way, it's "good enough"
[04:21:10] <Rashad> evolv Try making the situation you want to remember as an example for the concept by which you understand it, then you are less likely to forget it.
[04:21:46] <Rashad> For example if you see a bird, take observations from it and fit them to your concept of a bird, but in detail.
[04:22:19] <Rashad> "It has two wings, they are shaped in this certain way which is common for this type of bird because their size and shape are as such..."
[04:22:22] <evolv> then you force the reality into the concept
[04:22:44] <evolv> er, you force the reality to the concept in your perception
[04:22:51] <evolv> and cannot see the reality for what it is
[04:22:57] <Rashad> But if you immediately recognize that it is a bird and don't care about the specific details of what color it has or how high it can fly then you will not remember those things.
[04:22:57] <evolv> which I believe we do
[04:23:39] <evolv> maybe we can't see it for what it is precisely because of that
[04:24:09] <evolv> the bird in our minds doesn't change, but the bird in reality does
[04:24:16] <evolv> because it's empty of essence
[04:24:36] <Rashad> It's like when someone asks you "how can we move an object across a table?". A conceptual or creative person would something like "gravity could be an option where we introduce tilt in the table."
[04:24:52] <Rashad> Notice here that there is no mention of any of the details about what kind of table it is or what kind of object it is.
[04:25:30] <Rashad> Other people which frustrate me at work will immediately answer: "Which table? How does it look like? How much does it cost?"
[04:25:42] <evolv> hahaha, but that makes sense
[04:25:51] <Rashad> I would assume the latter has much better memories but I could be wrong.
[04:25:52] <evolv> you can get different answers based on the models people make without additional details
[04:26:20] <evolv> if people play along and don't ask for details, you would get more fun answers
[04:26:42] <evolv> then you know exactly what people initially model in their minds as a table and object
[04:26:57] <evolv> for example, I realized I envisioned a billiards table and ball
[04:27:52] <evolv> if the table surface is made of velcro and the object is made of velcro, no tilt would do
[04:29:03] <evolv> I'd argue those people may not be those with better memories, but those who want to get the answer right on the first or second go
[04:29:55] <Rashad> I think it's a matter of not being able to separate what something is from the sensations they gather about it.
[04:31:06] <Rashad> I don't know if such a mentality exists where you're from, but here in Jordan there are people who would have a visceral reaction if they saw something they're used to seeing changed in some sensual manner.
[04:31:30] <Rashad> For example if they always knew keys to be a certain shape because all the importers got them from Italy,
[04:31:38] <evolv> that's universal. I'm in the US, but that is exactly what Buddha addressed
[04:31:53] <Rashad> then international trade changed and someone started importing from Spain and they make keys of a different shape.
[04:31:58] <evolv> aversion to change, inconstancy, better known as "impermanence"
[04:32:24] <Rashad> Some would even say "the new keys are evil, they are possessed by the devil and this is a conspiracy to kill all muslims"
[04:32:56] <evolv> an object is a result of delusion of what the object really is. We're stuck on something that appears fixed when it is not. Just a fleeting entanglement of properties
[04:33:48] <evolv> it is caused by our senses. Our senses are convincing that the objects are really static things despite knowing they change

[15:00:48] <Digit> not all H (or O) in H2O are the same, given there's dueterium and tritium isotopes (typically around 130 to over 160 ppm), then there are other properties, like specifics of purity, charge, shape and arrangement ("memory"), and much more we don't yet know / can prove.  There are many trace elements in himalayan salt, and "just NaCl" is as inaccurate (and more) for it, than for "table salt" which typically comes with descicants and other
[15:00:48] <Digit> polutants despite being proclaimed "just NaCl".  traces and nuances have huge implications and changes of trajectory (like cmall changes of seed conditions in chaotic systems), and over-generalising and believing the cartoon over-generalisations will land you in trouble.  re: [2021-10- 4 01:04:36] <Rashad> The concept of "holy water" implies that there is water that is H2O that is different from other water that is also H2O. & [2021-10-

[19:11:56] <evolv> inclusivity is good for business, hence these issues arise during major holiday shopping days to maximize profits
[19:13:05] <evolv> additionally, businesses are not made up of cold, wealth motivated individuals, although some are, so those higher ups may actually be compassionate enough to care. Some higher ups make up those groups not represented by the status quo
[19:14:57] <evolv> however, corporate involvement in social justice has caused backlash in leftist (primarily Marxist) groups to maintain class stratification via identify politics
[19:15:41] <evolv> I think some of that is true, but Marxists boiling everything down to class is naive and limiting
[19:17:15] <evolv> it doesn't all boil down to material circumstances, it's all about sign value
[19:18:27] <evolv> politically speaking, the truth goes deeper into the truth of suffering and poor means to resolve suffering
[19:21:26] <evolv> that was a total aside, but it's difficult to get into inclusivity without bringing up idpol and Marxist (and some other leftist) takes

[19:24:07] <evolv> personally, I believe Christians who opposite inclusivity as a dangerous corruption and oppressive to them as a fear response to change.

[19:38:31] <pussipupu> Good evening arryana
[19:38:34] <biys> evolv: what do you think about the idea that it seems okay to lambaste a christian for their believes but being critical of muslims, for example, is problematic?
[19:38:46] <biys> :s/believes/beliefs/
[19:39:07] <biys> can we be equally critical of a once marginalized religion in the current context of inclusivity?
[19:39:24] <biys> or do we have to allow them the same amount of time to be just as potentially terrible and problematic?
[19:40:29] <pussipupu> One of the cats is cross with me for waking her up, how's your end?
[19:41:21] <biys> how about judaism?  are jews forever just the holocaust and will any critique of their beliefs forever be anti jew? or will a point be reached where it'll be okay to be critical of judaism?
[19:42:42] <evolv> biys, being critical of Muslims is punching down. They do not have any meaningful power in West vs Christians
[19:42:50] <biys> what i mean by this is... it seems that along with inclusivity there seems to be a perception that one group or another regardless of the problematic ideas of their culture/ethnicity/religion whatever ought to be given a free pass
[19:43:25] <biys> we aren't allowed to be critical of their belief systems or their structures or their cultures... are we?
[19:43:35] <evolv> we are allowed, nobody stops us
[19:43:45] <evolv> we will get criticized in return, sure
[19:44:02] <biys> no one stopped hitchens other than the cigarette companies i guess
[19:44:20] <evolv> but there are no consequences to you if you choose to do so. You may, inadvertently, be distracting others about the issue at hand
[19:44:37] <biys> gotcha
[19:45:59] <evolv> and the kind of critique is important. It's usually not constructive criticism, even towards Christians. It's riddled with guilt and shame, and that means pushback because nobody wants to feel guilt and shame. You end up creating the demon and feeding it
[19:46:17] <evolv> compassion and empathy can transform any demon into an angel
[19:46:17] <biys> exactly
[19:46:41] <biys> but do all ideas deserve to be handled with kid gloves so to speak?
[19:47:07] <biys> if i told you "my people" upheld, by your standards, some absolutely heinous idea
[19:47:47] <biys> will it always require kid gloves regardless?
[19:49:03] <biys> this very much sounds like a system where clarity is avoided and it's more-so regarding peoples interpretations of the matters and how they feel
[19:49:07] <biys> but that is an aside really
[19:50:04] <biys> mentioning that this specific quality or that specific idea is problematic out not be danced about..  no?  do i dance about the idea further depending on the individuals intersectionality ?

[20:30:02] <biys> i'm not really taking any kind of position
[20:30:19] <biys> i'm just attempting to make sense of a few things i've seen over the last little bit
[20:30:42] <biys> where an individual made a comment about some of the terrible things a group of people have done as a result of religion and they were essentially dragged throught he mud for it
[20:30:54] <biys> yet i've watched instances where that exact same group has been super critical of other religions
[20:30:57] <biys> and it seems to be okay
[20:31:36] <pussipupu> And IME there's a general parallel of “my house my rules” standing
[20:32:49] <biys> well
[20:32:57] <biys> you're kind of swinging around the conversation a bit here
[20:33:05] <biys> it was abotu how we ought ot react or respond
[20:33:40] <arryana> oooh, printed watering can is awesome
[20:33:44] <biys> the claim was that regardless the idea or concept the individuals are to be treated with a certain level of respect
[20:33:47] <biys> by default
[20:33:59] <biys> i used a house as an example because it's an easier scenario to grasp in this case
[20:34:21] <biys> if i go to my friends house and don't take my shoes off and just walk through their house because, at my hosue and others i know, we don't take our shoes off there
[20:34:34] <biys> what level of respect should i be treated with?
[20:34:39] <biys> and what if i decline?
[20:35:35] <biys> should it be expected that my friend is just inclusive?
[20:35:38] <biys> they accept my idea and my opinion
[20:35:46] <biys> and they allow me to awlk about their house with my shoes on?
[20:35:56] <biys> it is an unreasonable expectation on my part that my friend should do that?
[20:36:19] <pussipupu> Though there isn't a general rule about not discussing the rules of a host's house which would seem closer to your original point

[21:01:29] <biys> with regards to their compliance/acceptance/noncompliance/nonacceptance of ideas
[21:01:56] <biys> in that if i was marginalized significantly i can be less accepting of ideas/concepts and as a result i can actualyl expect that people be MORE accepting of my ideas and concepts

[21:02:28] <biys> that is my perceptions of what i hear anyways
[21:02:30] <biys> i could be wrong
[21:03:14] <biys> i can be called a racist or a zenophobe for believing that someoen from _that_ culture/ethinity/religion uphold problematic ideas
[21:03:22] <biys> as a result of their current position within the society
[21:03:45] <biys> i call it a "free pass" kind of
[21:03:54] <biys> as far as the logic has been suggested to me anyways
[21:04:13] <biys> we give peopel who have potentially a problematic opinion/idea/concept a "free pass" BECASUE they've been marginalzied to some extent

[23:11:29] <audrey> Sex positivity was great for men and terrible for women.
[23:12:11] <audrey> Just hope the emotional scars of this generation of women, can still be healed.
[23:13:42] <kmh> maybe
[23:14:15] <kmh> it depends a bit what "sex positivity" is supposed to be
[23:14:37] <kmh> anyhow i thought you might find that interesting
[23:14:45] <audrey> I will put that on my watchlist for today
[23:14:58] <audrey> description looks promising though idk how much it goes into the usual feminism-trashing
[23:16:02] <kmh> audrey,  well the commentator is a a bit of christian conservative ditz imho, however relatively sane
[23:17:38] <audrey> I guess I´m a little frustrated at how the only two positions that the media is willing to entertain on this issue is, «liberal-feminist super-uber sex positive» and «lulz feminists PWNED» conservative
[23:18:25] <audrey> The only feminist writings I can seriously engage with these days are those of Andrea Dworkin and Catherine MacKinnon.
[23:19:58] <audrey> If someone is familiar with other intellectuals in that general tradition who are more contemporary, I´m all ears
[23:21:24] *** Joins: CryptoDavid (uid14990@id-14990.uxbridge.irccloud.com)
[23:22:24] <kmh> i'm still bit fuzzy about the term
[23:23:15] <mannequin> pasmatri
[23:23:56] <kmh> if you see sex positivity as positive attitude towards sex (in constrast to oppressive sex morals of abrahamic religions for instance) that i'd regard as good if not natural thing
[23:23:58] <brigand> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-positive_movement
[23:23:58] <ro-bot-o> [url] Sex-positive movement - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[23:24:59] <kmh> however if you understand sex positivity as promoting promiscuity then that's a different story and then it seems like a rather dumb attitude
[23:25:42] <kmh> brigand,  yeah i browsed that at i'd read the lead as suggesting the first option rather than the last
[23:25:56] <brigand> is promiscuity terrible for women?

[23:26:44] <kmh> but it is hardly a requirement for positive or "psychologically healthy" attitude4 towards sex
[23:27:02] <brigand> i agree
[23:27:13] <kmh> and there is not not "one woman" in this context
[23:27:28] *** Joins: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse)
[23:27:35] <kmh> for some women promiscuity is great for other a disaster
[23:27:44] <kmh> and the same for men
[23:29:11] <kmh> personally i don't like all those cliched expectations and that society tries to unecessarily meddle with the sex life of people
[23:30:20] <kmh> or simply and somewhat crudely put, they can all fuck off as far as i'm concerned
