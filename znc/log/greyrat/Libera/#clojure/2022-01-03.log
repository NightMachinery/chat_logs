[22:09:56] <jeaye> But, after all that, it revolutionized space travel in a way which hasn't happen in decades.
[22:10:20] <jeaye> Just as Tesla revolutionized the EV and battery industries.
[22:11:27] <jeaye> Musk gets results and those results help us.
[22:11:27] <technomancy> did they really revolutionize electric vehicles in a good way? their cars score way below other EVs in independent reliability tests.

[22:14:24] <technomancy> it seems most of the "innovation" lies in coming up with new ways of "how to deflect blame" and "how to treat your workers somehow even worse"
[22:20:19] <jeaye> Yes, absolutely, technomancy.
[22:22:07] <jeaye> Tesla plowed the way forward and is a big reason why we have the competition we have right now in the EV space. It did this by not only very much being a battery company, but by also putting out an EV which are international hits and top the charts in multiple ways (including safety, sportiness, and range).
[22:22:53] <jeaye> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.#Automotive_products
[22:23:13] <wink> in a world without US tech salaries I doubt the tesla could have happened though
[22:23:32] <jeaye> Read that entry for the Model S. That's what revolutionized the EV industry.
[22:24:05] <jeaye> wink: Why does that matter?
[22:24:11] <wink> because they feel so damn rare here in Germany
[22:24:16] <wink> I see one maybe once a month
[22:24:23] <wink> it's just too expensive
[22:24:31] <jeaye> Oh, you mean people can't afford them without having a US tech salary. Got it.
[22:24:51] <wink> yeah, Germany is not exactly well known for cheap cars or people not caring
[22:24:55] <wink> and still they are so rare
[22:25:05] <technomancy> I'd rather have health care and public transit than electric cars.
[22:25:11] <jeaye> In the US, Teslas are actually middle of the pack, when it comes to EVs. I've been researching this lately, since I'm looking to buy a new car.
[22:25:41] <jeaye> technomancy: Me too. That's one thing countries like Singapore, Japan, and South Korea do much better than us.
[22:26:21] <jeaye> But the US has far too much of car culture to make that happen, so EVs are the next logical step.
[22:28:43] <jeaye> wink: If you look at compact SUVs, the Model Y is around $58k. You can get a VW ID.4 for $46k or an Audi e-tron for $83k. The Model Y sits right in the middle, yet it has dual motor AWD and a longer range than all of them.
[22:28:52] <jeaye> (USD)
[22:29:25] <technomancy> how do people feel about plurals in namespace names?

[22:30:26] <technomancy> yeah... it seems like if a name can be plural or singular, it's just one more thing to mix up and have to remember
[22:30:57] <technomancy> with locals it's completely different because the usage should be close enough to the declaration that you don't have to memorize it
[22:34:38] <wink> jeaye: yeah, talking more historically with only the S available. and I think without selling those they would not have continued
[22:34:56] <jeaye> Agreed.
[22:34:58] <jeaye> wink: The EVs have a higher up-front cost, but the ICE cars have a higher amortized cost. If you instead went with a Subaru Ascent for $32k, it seems much cheaper. But, after 200k miles at 21mpg, you're paying $30k for gas.
