[00:06:23] <bookworm> the amount of spam the git list gets is astonishing... one wonders if they even bothered to put a spam filter in the mix
[00:07:46] <MaxLeiter> mailing list?
[00:10:11] <bookworm> yeah
[00:11:01] <bookworm> on the plus side, I have a bunch of girlfriends now, won the lottery a few times and my uncle from Africa wants to send me money too
[00:11:31] <MaxLeiter> huh we might have the same uncle, hes hit me up about that 
[00:11:37] <bookworm> ^^
[00:12:13] <bookworm> have you watched the TED talk "what happens if you reply to spammers" or some such?
[00:12:15] <xnaas> haven't opened the ol' spam folder in a long time
[00:12:18] <bookworm> it's really funny
[00:12:18] <xnaas> a lot of french shit in there
[00:12:37] <Activ8> I've seen that funny as
[00:12:54] <bookworm> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiLS7U7YIdc

[00:35:44] <MaxLeiter> bookworm: not sure severities is actually a word but it makes sense to me ü§∑
[00:36:00] <MaxLeiter> at least, spellcheck doesnt like it
[00:36:22] <bookworm> that thing one of the uncountable words?
[00:36:28] * bookworm is not a native speaker
[00:37:25] <bookworm> priority levels?
[00:37:31] <bookworm> still making sense?
[00:38:20] <bookworm> level of severity is what the python docs use
[00:39:27] <bookworm> changed it to that as well
[00:40:04] <MaxLeiter> üëç nice
