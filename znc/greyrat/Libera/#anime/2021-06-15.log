[00:35:28] <theholyduck> anyways in case nobody here got the news. we have now officially aquired ##anime from the libera ircops so anyone who awants an active.channel that isnt going to get shut down by libera staff the second l0de posts a picture of his dong in here are more than welcome to join
[00:37:38] <l0de> I have never posted a picture of my penis here
[00:37:58] <l0de> this channel is much better than some double hash loser pit ruled over by corrupt ops
[00:38:03] <l0de> here in #anime we are all equals
[00:39:38] <Roey> theholyduck: so will there be only one anime channel now? #anime ##anime ##otaku ?
[00:39:51] <theholyduck> Roey: ##otaku now forwards to #anime
[00:39:53] <luke-jr> Roey: freenode #anime is still freenode #anime for now
[00:39:57] <Roey> oh! how lovely!!
[00:40:06] <Roey> theholyduck, luke-jr: congratulations!! Good job!!
[00:40:10] <theholyduck> once we have the word out. for everyone whos afk etc,etc
[00:40:15] <luke-jr> ##anime here is not the same channel at all; it is the result of a hostile takeover
[00:40:22] <theholyduck> we will presumably shut it down 
[00:40:27] <Roey> ok good to know, thank you
[00:40:29] <theholyduck> Roey: yeah luke is not part of the moving to libera ##anime :P
[00:40:38] <Roey> ok
[00:40:43] <Roey> I dunno I just want one channel to sit in
[00:40:54] <theholyduck> Roey:  then ##anime is the one
[00:41:03] <theholyduck> libera ircops officially handed it to us today
[00:41:13] <Roey> \o/
[00:41:14] <theholyduck> and as fast as we can get the word out. we are migrating people there
[00:41:19] <luke-jr> freenode #anime if you don't want power-hungry ops who take over channels
[00:41:38] <jess> im mostly just spaghetti hungry
[00:41:52] <Roey> ok now I'm confused... is THE channel for anime on Libera now #anime or ##anime
[00:41:58] <Roey> sounds like it's ##anime, yes?
[00:42:07] <luke-jr> Roey: none of the above
[00:42:09] <Roey> and ##otaku should be forwarding to ##anime?
[00:42:16] <jess> if you want a channel about anime, it's ##anime. if you want a channel about anime specifically owned by luke-jr then you probably want #anime on freenode
[00:42:25] <Roey> ok, *thank you*
[00:42:29] <Roey> that clered it up for me.
[00:42:39] <jess> no prob
[00:42:46] <Roey> so what is this channel still here for, then
[00:42:52] <Roey> it'll get closed down presumably?
[00:42:56] <Roey> as will ##otaku?
[00:42:56] <luke-jr> hopefully freenode #anime can move here eventually
[00:43:03] <Roey> aye
[00:43:12] <jess> this channel does feel like a bit of a liability without ops
[00:43:23] <Roey> of course it feels like a liability without ops.
[00:43:23] <theholyduck> Roey:  :P its presumably getting closed. we have a petition going to have it forward to ##anime here
[00:43:38] <theholyduck> untill some legit FOSS project claims it
[00:43:41] <theholyduck> anyway
[00:43:42] <G-Flex> this channel doesn't fit the libera namespace policies, I don't see how it would stay
[00:43:50] <theholyduck> G-Flex: it presumably wont :P
[00:44:00] <Roey> so when are you shooting people out of ##otaku
[00:44:01] <Roey> ?
[00:44:01] <theholyduck> G-Flex: but until we aquired ##anime there was nowhere sensible to direct it to
[00:44:14] <theholyduck> Roey: we allready made it so anyone rejoining there gets forwardet to ##anime
[00:44:19] <Roey> ok.
[00:44:19] <jess> i'm trying to get other staff opinions on what to do this this channel here
[00:44:48] <luke-jr> jess: would be nice to migrate FN #anime here :/
[00:45:08] <theholyduck> G-Flex:  like ##anime was also held by a troll.
[00:45:11] <jess> well, i don't want to go through this discussion again
[00:45:14] <theholyduck> then it was held by libera staff
[00:45:18] <jess> but there's namespace policies that would make it difficult
[00:45:41] <theholyduck> G-Flex:  we since convinced libera staff to hand it to the people who did the day to day work of running #anime and the people who did the day to day work of running ##anime both on freenode. 
[00:45:44] <luke-jr> jess: what new policy specifically? we were FOSS enough for FN
[00:45:54] <theholyduck> luke-jr: we also predated the rule didnt we
[00:45:59] <theholyduck> freenode #anime was super old
[00:46:04] *** Parts: Roey (~Roey@user/Roey) (Client exiting)
[00:46:06] <theholyduck> also there was a hostile channel on ##
[00:46:08] <G-Flex> I don't know how to say this, but being an anime fan is not being the group contact for a FOSS project
[00:46:08] <jess> it's not a new policy
[00:46:20] <theholyduck> jess: but #anime on freenode was like
[00:46:23] <theholyduck> 2001?
[00:46:29] <theholyduck> i think it predated the freenode namespace policy
