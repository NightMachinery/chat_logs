[01:59:59] <programmerq> Tach: the way I do my ingress stuff is I'll have one compose file for nginx-proxy or traefik or whatever called "proxy". I override the name so it's just "proxy" with no prefix.
[02:00:54] <programmerq> then in any other compose file that I want to use with the proxy, I add a second network to the compose project and mark it as "external" and set the name to "proxy"
[02:01:43] <programmerq> then I can bring up my node app or whatever. The node container itself would be on two docker networks-- the default network for the compose project and the proxy network. Any other containers in the project would only be on the default network (database, cache, worker, etc)
[02:03:33] <GunArm> programmerq: clever.  thanks

[02:27:32] <rawtaz> question; how much does using user remapping with docker alleviate the need to run stuff inside containers as non-root users? if a container runs the process as its internal root, thats remapped to a "harmless" user on the host, in one sense. but at the same time, if theres a bug or misconfiguration in the remapping, you end up in a situation where you'd be happy if you had run the container rootless after all.

[03:32:31] <rawtaz> what start are you talking about?
[03:32:51] <az> docker start "container_name"
[03:33:35] <rawtaz> az: start just starts a stopped container that was already started (and hten stopped)
[03:33:47] <rawtaz> so it doesnt change the running configuration of the container.
[03:34:11] <rawtaz> you need to stop the container and apply the -e with the run command instead
[03:34:34] <az> yeah, I was trying to find out if I can just kill that node process and add debug live without changing much
[03:34:53] <rawtaz> can you destroy the container without losing data? or did you mess things up such that you dont have bind mounts or volumes for the paths in it where it writes data you wnat to persist? :)
[03:35:17] <rawtaz> probably not. firs tof all the moment the process exits, docker will consider the container to have terminated
[03:35:28] <rawtaz> second i dont think you can add environment to a running process? :o
[03:36:57] *** Quits: Feuermagier (~Feuermagi@user/feuermagier) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:37:35] <rawtaz> in general i would say this; make your docker images and containers such that you can stop and destroy them any time without losing anything you want to keep, and then just restart them

[04:38:58] <BtbN> "populate"?
[04:43:11] <minimal> bn_work: for WSL wouldn't that be for Microsoft, rather than Docker, to document as they're the people behind WSL?

[04:45:18] <bn_work> minimal: sure, but at least for WSL(2) it maps to a hidden absolute UNC path that one can easily share/paste.  For HyperV, good luck trying to explain to a Windows user how to get something there
[04:46:17] <bn_work> & if that changes & breaks, you will have to deal with that
[04:47:10] <BtbN> You should not need to know where the files in a volume physically are
[04:47:18] <BtbN> it's not part of the API/ABI, and can change without notice
[04:47:27] <BtbN> if you want to access files in a volume, do so via docker
[04:48:00] <bn_work> Does Docker only work with HyperV?  or do I need to worry if they're using VBox, VMWare (Fusion), Xen, <insert_your_favorite_virtualization_flavor_on_Windows_here>, etc. too?
[04:48:28] <BtbN> You'll pretty much always want to run Docker on top of WSL2 (which itself is basically HyperV)
[04:49:10] <bn_work> BtbN: what method does docker provide to operate on files in a volume?  I am not aware of any except from within a container
[04:49:29] <bn_work> BtbN: yes, but WSL2 is only supported on newer versions of Windows
[04:49:30] <BtbN> You mount it into a container and access it from there, exactly
[04:49:53] <BtbN> Anything so old that it doesn't support WSL2 is approaching the point of EOL from Microsoft, so nothing you need to bother with
[04:50:25] <bn_work> BtbN: that doesn't help if you're trying to place data *for* the container to use, vs the other way around
[04:50:51] <BtbN> Just mount wherever the data is as well, and then copy
[04:51:33] <BtbN> not _that_ unfathomable to do docker run ... -v /a -v /b cp /a/* /b
[04:52:04] <DoofusCanadensis> Docker Desktop will do some fakery to make that work
[04:52:27] <bn_work> so does Docker on Windows support other VM flavors?  
[04:52:29] <DoofusCanadensis> but yeah, I think WSL2 integration gives the easiest access to Docker Desktop data
[04:52:48] <bn_work> DoofusCanadensis: I agree but not everyone is on Windows vLatest
[04:53:16] <BtbN> WSL2 is not "vLatest"
[04:53:21] <BtbN> it exists since... quite a while
[04:53:28] <DoofusCanadensis> well if you don't have WSL2 available, then Docker Desktop runs docker inside a Linux VM
[04:53:35] <DoofusCanadensis> and it's more work
[04:53:44] <DoofusCanadensis> WSL2 is recommended
[04:53:53] <DoofusCanadensis> no I take that back
[04:54:27] <BtbN> The VBox backend is horrible, you really don't want to deal with that anymore
[04:54:48] <DoofusCanadensis> I only recall I was asked about HyperV or not
[04:55:19] <DoofusCanadensis> and if you want WSL integration (which is pretty slick and nobody should not have it available), then WSL2 is the only thing you can use for that
[04:55:45] <DoofusCanadensis> WSL2 was released mid 2019... that's 2.5 years ago
[04:56:05] <BtbN> Any Win10 version without WSL is closing in on EOL
[04:56:14] <DoofusCanadensis> mmhmm
[04:56:21] <bn_work> Personally I wish I didn't have to deal with that confounded OS but ... there are too many clueless Windows users out there
[04:56:28] <BtbN> *without WSL2
[04:56:35] <DoofusCanadensis> we're chomping at the bit to get Win11 on our machines
[04:56:51] <BtbN> WSL2 is old enough to depend on it
[04:56:53] <DoofusCanadensis> then give them Linux machines 
[04:57:08] *** Quits: Feuermagier (~Feuermagi@user/feuermagier) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:57:08] <DoofusCanadensis> Docker Desktop comes with a subscription requirement now
[04:57:11] <BtbN> If someone is on such an old version to not have it, that PC and User has a bigger issue at hand
[04:57:35] <BtbN> It only requires a subscription if you're making larger amounts of money with it
[04:57:47] <DoofusCanadensis> and have enough employees... yes
[04:57:57] <DoofusCanadensis> my company meets that
[04:58:05] <BtbN> OR have enough employees
[04:58:19] <DoofusCanadensis> but the number who actually need docker here? me... and maybe one other
[04:58:31] <DoofusCanadensis> so give me a proper VM and let me manage it that way
[04:58:41] <bn_work> Our Windows users will most likely be running this on a server
[04:58:49] <BtbN> You can always just install Docker in WSL2 the way you would on a normal Linux
[04:58:57] <DoofusCanadensis> bn_work: umm, ewww
[04:59:12] <DoofusCanadensis> can you? oh wait... mine was WSL1
[04:59:16] <DoofusCanadensis> it did NOT like that
[04:59:27] <BtbN> I miss WSL1. It was the much nicer approach
[04:59:31] <bn_work> so doubt they can get that free?  (unless MS is seriously desperate now, lol)
[04:59:45] <DoofusCanadensis> I have to use WSL1 due to WSL2 not working with our VPN
[04:59:57] <DoofusCanadensis> that's not an MS fee
[05:00:17] <BtbN> WSL2 not working with your VPN? The hell kinda trash VPN you got.
[05:00:22] <DoofusCanadensis> Citrix
[05:00:24] <bn_work> DoofusCanadensis: I actually liked WSL1 better as it was an attempt to run the Linux kernel natively at least, but they gave up and said "f-it, we'll just run it in a HyperV VM", lol
[05:00:41] <BtbN> WSL1 did not run a Linux kernel at all.
[05:00:46] <BtbN> That was its whole deal
[05:00:47] *** Joins: Feuermagier (~Feuermagi@user/feuermagier)
[05:00:49] <BtbN> it's reverse-wine
[05:00:59] <DoofusCanadensis> ^
[05:01:15] <BtbN> I kinda wish they'd have kept pushing that approach
[05:01:22] <BtbN> it was much less overhead and tighter integrated
[05:01:32] <DoofusCanadensis> if it was a hyperv vm, I would probably be able to use it
[05:01:37] <bn_work> it was heavily modified version of Linux, IIRC?
[05:01:47] <BtbN> no
[05:01:53] <BtbN> It was a syscall translation layer
[05:01:59] <minimal> dn_work: Docker is a *Linux* app, it relies on a Linux kernel and in particular on the namespaces and cgroups features of the kernel. Any "solution" to get Docker running on either a Mac or Windows involves getting Linux running on top of Mac/Windows, typically via virtualisation. WSL2 (which I haven't used) is AFAIK some kidof not-quite-normal-virtualisation approach to again get Linux running on Windows
[05:02:35] <BtbN> WSL2 is a special HyperV VM with some special bits to integrate it more into the Host
[05:02:45] <BtbN> But it IS running a full Linux Kernel in that VM
[05:03:30] <DoofusCanadensis> on macOS it runs under a HyperKit VM, iirc
[05:03:51] <minimal> yes, the point making is that Docker does not run natively on either Mac or Windows, it only run natively on Linux - the other OS approaches are way to "kludge" about this, i.e. by Virtualisation
[05:03:58] <DoofusCanadensis> regardless, for best developer experience, provide Linux
[05:04:17] <BtbN> tbf, Docker _does_ run natively on Windows
[05:04:24] <BtbN> but Windows Containers are a whole other beast
[05:04:33] <DoofusCanadensis> yeah, I have a lab server to set up for that
[05:04:43] <bn_work> yeah, I guess reverse-wine is a good way to describe WSL1
[05:05:13] <minimal> BtbN: I'm not talking about Windows Containers (not even sure what they are) I'm talking about "native"/"real" Docker Container
[05:05:23] <DoofusCanadensis> how old a Windows are we talking about anyway?
[05:05:31] <BtbN> minimal, you can have Windows _inside_ a docker container.
[05:05:37] <BtbN> And that naturally does not need any VMs to run on Windows.
[05:05:39] <DoofusCanadensis> minimal: Microsoft bought the koolaid
[05:05:53] <DoofusCanadensis> and Server 2016+ can run native Windows containers
[05:07:40] <minimal> BtnN: so I just write "FROM win11:latest" at the start of my Dockerfile then?
[05:08:08] <DoofusCanadensis> generally microsoft-server-core... hang on
[05:08:35] <akik> you can install docker in wsl 2
[05:09:02] <bn_work> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-2---check-requirements-for-running-wsl-2 "WSL 2 is only available in Windows 10, Version 1903, Build 18362 or higher" ok... but then https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-on-server ??

[05:12:25] <minimal> DoofusCanadensis: so that's for creating "Windows Containers" that can only run on top of Windows
[05:12:33] <minimal> its not for Docker/OCI Containers
[05:12:33] <DoofusCanadensis> for a server, I'd probably install Linux in HyperV and run docker via that
[05:12:36] <DoofusCanadensis> minimal: right
[05:12:50] <BtbN> For a Server, I'd install Linux.
[05:12:55] <BtbN> If I needed Docker
[05:12:59] <DoofusCanadensis> well yeah, me too
[05:13:23] <DoofusCanadensis> but it's looking like they have a windows server already and are planning to install WSL to get Docker Desktop working?
[05:13:40] <DoofusCanadensis> I dunno
[05:13:50] <minimal> while is the point I've made already - in order to run Docker/OCI Containers on Mac or Windows it require either some method of virtualisatio n(i.e. a Linux VM no top of windows) to run docker in, or else in theory Windows/MacOS could emulate a linux kernel
[05:14:21] *** Joins: Feuermagier (~Feuermagi@user/feuermagier)
[05:14:29] <DoofusCanadensis> yeah. Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 looks like it offers emulation
[05:14:55] <DoofusCanadensis> macOS is still BSD underneath so probably no interest in doing any kind of emulation there
[05:15:39] <minimal> so back to the questions around documentation of how volumes appar on Windows - that a qustyion for Microsoft re: Hyper-V or WSL/WSL2 as to how thev perform and interact with the Linux virtualisation/emulation that they perform, its not a question for Docker themselves
[05:15:48] <BtbN> WSL1 was and is not capable of hosting Docker containers
[05:15:57] <BtbN> You need a proper Linux kernel running _somewhere_
[05:15:57] <DoofusCanadensis> ^
[05:16:10] <DoofusCanadensis> That is my experience

[05:17:49] <DoofusCanadensis> there might be some description in here somewhere: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/
[05:20:23] <DoofusCanadensis> actually, yeah your choices are WSL2 integration or HyperV
[05:20:52] <DoofusCanadensis> WSL2 is gonna be way easier on everybody
[05:21:12] <DoofusCanadensis> HyperV can be configured to make volumes accessible

[11:37:47] <vaio> I'm trying to use volumes with nfs, but it seems the container fails to start with error "ERROR: for sabotage-derpbot  UnixHTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=None): Read timed out. (read timeout=60)" (full multi-line error message here: https://0x0.st/oH3o.txt );  manually mounting the nfs shares (sudo mount ...) works fine; so I wonder if there's some issue with my docker-compose file
[11:37:49] <vaio> (avail. here: https://0x0.st/oH3i.yaml%2513 ).  Would it be possible for someone to review it ?
[11:38:32] <vaio> also, nfs doesn't need to be present in the docker container, right ?

I made 2 services in a docker-compose file. When I start the beanstalk serice with `docker-compose up` and then try to launch the ruby script with `docker-compose run` the script doesnt reach the beanstalkd, even though its running. What am I doing
[13:21:21] <IsoLinCHiP> wrong?

[16:52:03] <nickjj> for bind mounts, a textbook example would be wanting to mount in all of my code in the current directory so i can develop the app without rebuilding -- it's also useful to bind mount paths where the paths are something you control (such as a ./public directory to host assets from nginx running on your docker host)

[16:53:23] <rawtaz> nickjj: yeah. ive used bind mounts pretty much all the time for years. i think its the way to go, to mount the host paths you need into the container. BUT, im pondering if i should switch to using volumes instead. doesnt seem complex to use docker cp etc to put/Get stuff in the volumes when you need to, and you can always just fire up a container with a vol mounted if you need to do some more maintenance on it.
[16:53:25] <nickjj> i wrote about this in more detail at https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/docker-tip-28-named-volumes-vs-path-based-volumes
[16:54:00] <rawtaz> nickjj: the reason im pondering this is to not have to correct/adjust filesystem permissions/ownership on the host for the bindmounted dirs/files, or configure the docker image etc in such a way that you showed the other day.
[16:54:25] <rawtaz> in other words, im beginnign to think that the need to document the specific ownership for the dirs in question isnt worth it, that one might just as well use volumes instead.
[16:54:58] <rawtaz> that said, i understand both types of thing, and how to use it. im just trying to decide which is the best default mode in terms of project maintenance etc
[16:55:02] <rawtaz> will read, thanks
[16:55:11] <nickjj> it's not much more than the above comments
[16:56:06] <rawtaz> nickjj: if i were to go with volumes instead of bind mounts, do you think that would be a bad decision? i mean, do you see issues or a burden in managing/maintaining/working with volumes instead of the files on the host (at the cost of owner/perms management), that is relevant?
[16:56:10] <nickjj> if you use named volumes to store something like file uploads, that seems potentially questionable because your web server (nginx) would need to be configured to read from that directory -- but now you're reading a directory internally managed by docker and owned by root
[16:57:34] <nickjj> in the database case for using named volumes it's fine because you never really interact with the files there directly, you would normally sql dump a file out if you wanted to export your database and also import that sql file to import
[16:57:37] <rawtaz> well every container using volumes would of course get one volume per path that i would otherwise bind mount. and it would then have that available for both storing and reading e.g. the files you mentioned.
[16:57:48] <rawtaz> yeah
[16:59:56] <rawtaz> "now you're reading a directory internally managed by docker and owned by root" <-- is that a problem? im not sure im missing something.
[17:00:12] <rawtaz> just to be clear, i would not touch the volumes where docker stores them, i'd interact using containers only
[17:00:22] <rawtaz> (simply due to best practice)
[17:00:50] <nickjj> i'd consider it a problem for some use cases, like dealing with static files
[17:01:54] <rawtaz> i hope you can elaborate on that :D but if youre busy now lets do it later, i dont want to take your most precious time in a working day
[17:03:09] <nickjj> this is in the context of running nginx outside of docker btw, i don't know if you do that but i do
[17:03:29] <rawtaz> i run all services in docker containers, so the host wont have anything like that. the host just has docker basically
[17:04:09] <nickjj> i do that too, except for nginx -- but that's more of a personal opinion, i think there's tons of advantages not to run nginx in docker
[17:04:20] <nickjj> but that's besides the point here
[17:04:28] <rawtaz> so everything having to read and write files relevant to this discussion can be considered to be containers. its just a nice to have that i can read/write them on/from the host when i need to poke around with things in the files (e.g modify some config file for nextcloud)
[17:04:34] <wez> 15
[17:04:54] <rawtaz> aha. yeah. i run traefik instead of nginx, if its relevant. but perhaps youre talking web server and not revproxy
[17:05:28] <nickjj> yeah, i tend to use nginx on its own for both web a server and reverse proxy and skip using traefik
[17:05:40] <nickjj> what does nextcloud say to do? do they have a guide on how to set it up?
[17:06:10] <rawtaz> well they have their docker image over at docker hub. but i wouldnt use them as a source for best practice heh.
[17:06:16] <rawtaz> il have a look just for curiosity
[17:06:52] <rawtaz> their examples have named volumes
[17:07:58] <nickjj> i would stick to their guide, i don't know the implications of running nextcloud or what it expects -- my examples are catered towards a general use case of serving web apps

[17:08:11] <rawtaz> but like, both ways work. bind mounts have convenience of accessibility to the files from the host when you need to just poke around and do some maintenance or similar (or if you e.g. wanted to back them up from/on the host). the cost/downside is that you have to configure the permissions to the right UID/GID when you set up the container, and this might require looking into the image to see what they run the process as.
[17:08:45] <nickjj> in my case it's expected you have full control over your dockerfile too, so running things as a non-root user is no problem -- with nextcloud that might be more difficult
[17:08:53] <rawtaz> named volumes have the pro that you dont have to fiddle with the permissions, and the cost is instead that you need to use e.g. `docker cp` or fire up a container (no biggie) if you want to fiddle with the files in some container's volume. which isnt a big problem really.
[17:10:16] *** Quits: luva (~luva@146.70.62.244) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[17:10:50] <rawtaz> one should always have full control of the thing, even if not writing the Dockerfile etc oneself. i think one should do that and then use eitehr way, it doesnt matter what the examples in the readme says. as long as you make sure the perms are correct and know which paths are used inside the container, you are in control and can use either way :)
[17:11:12] <nickjj> you could share the named volume with 2 containers btw
[17:11:22] <rawtaz> i guess what im really noodling around for is if theres some downside to using volumes besides the one(S) i mentioned above. i dont want to start using that and then realize i missed some cumbersome aspect to it
[17:11:31] <nickjj> you can have them both point to the same named volume
[17:11:38] <rawtaz> yeah. both bind mounts and named volumes can be shared
[17:12:03] <nickjj> in the grand scheme of things this is a minor implementation detail
[17:12:24] *** Joins: luva (~luva@45.141.152.52)
[17:12:31] <nickjj> you can roll with one of them now, and if you decide 3 months down the line that you want to change it you can, it would be a matter of `cp`'ing files from 1 place to another and changing a few docker properties
[17:12:36] *** Quits: moldorcoder7 (~moldorcod@37.120.143.221) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[17:12:53] <rawtaz> thats actually one additional "downside" - if you use docker-compose for a few apps that are in different compose solutions, and you want to share a volume between two of them, you explicitly have to create and/or at least name the volume and make it external, so that they can both reference it easily. with bind mounts you need none of this, you just put the right path in there.
[17:12:59] <nickjj> minor in the sense that changing from A to B isn't a big deal
[17:13:42] <nickjj> yeah, bind mounts would be more convenient there if you have multiple projects each with their own COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME
[17:13:42] <rawtaz> yeah i agree. ok so in summary, you dont think im missing some con to using named modules then
[17:13:48] <rawtaz> yeah
[17:14:38] *** Joins: fercell (~ferr@185.65.50.97)
[17:14:41] <rawtaz> so the cons are basically; bindmounts = permission/ownership management like once when you set the container up. named volume = slightly less accessbility, and more cumbersome to share across compose solutions.

[21:39:25] <programmerq> that's something you can test yourself-- I don't know off the top of my head. why not do FROM <previousstage> instead of FROM scratch and then doing a copy?

[21:39:50] <bn_work> define "dong a copy"?
[21:40:18] <programmerq> you asked if you could copy everything from a previous stage to a new FROM scratch stage. that would be "doing a copy"
[21:40:44] <bn_work> I'm trying to free up the space used by the build files from the previous stage (since deleting it apparently does nothing to reduce the size once used/expanded)
[21:40:45] <programmerq> it seems arbitrary and unnecessary to do that given the fact that you can just do FROM <previousstage>
[21:40:54] <ikke> Seems like a creative way to squash an image?
[21:41:03] <programmerq> normally you would split up your stages in a way to avoid exactly that
[21:41:15] <programmerq> and then you'd copy only the build artifacts to the final stage
[21:41:24] <programmerq> that's kind of the core usecase of doing a multistage build
[21:41:27] <bn_work> oh, somehow had said before that doing `FROM <previousstage>` still doesn't clear up any deleted space
[21:41:35] <ikke> correct
[21:41:48] <ikke> well, no multi-stage starts fresh
[21:42:16] <ikke> But, you'd not do FROM <previousstage>
[21:42:29] <programmerq> you'd want to have your first stage get far enough that you haven't added any build specific things to it, then create a second stage from the first stage that adds the build deps and does the build, then a third stage that is from the first stage and copies only the build artifacts from the second stage.
[21:42:42] <ikke> You'd do FROM <baseimage>; COPY /path/the/artifacts /some/ocation
[21:43:14] <programmerq> that way you still get the benefit of a layered image, and you're not copying an entire filesystem and losing any image metadata from the original base image

[22:29:33] <programmerq> ada_: I've never heard that term before, lol "nerdsniping"
[22:30:35] <programmerq> yeah, I'm totally stuck. I podantiaffinity won't help because it basically just says "don't run this where there's a pod that meets this criteria on this node" but there will only be one pod per node in the daemonset anyway. I can't say "don't run this here if the node with the same particular label has the same value of this node has a pod matching this podselector"
[22:31:10] <ikke> programmerq: https://xkcd.com/356/
[22:31:13] <programmerq> someone on the k8s slack pointed out topologySpreadConstraint but that basically says "when I need to schedule a pod, make sure that there isn't an imbalance between nodes meeting this criteria"
[22:31:25] <ikke> And also: https://xkcd.com/1053/
[22:31:43] <ikke> (the latter is more meta)
[22:32:21] <programmerq> so if I have 5 nodes in 3 zones each, it can balance perfectly well across all 15 nodes, so I still get 15. If I have a zone with only two nodes, then the other zones will have up to 3 each since the minimum maxSkew value is 1 for topologySpreadConstraint
[22:32:41] <programmerq> it's almost like I need to write a custom controller/scheduler for this usecase, which is bonkers to me.
[22:33:00] <programmerq> I feel like it's more likely that I don't understand the numerous kube constraints and how they actually work.

[23:14:00] <bn_work> ok, just for the heck of it, I tried copying over the entire FS into a `FROM scratch ...` on the last build stage.  It seems to work?  to be sure I checked some special files.  Does this look normal?  Any others I should check?  PS:  I assume `/dev/sda` and friends shouldn't show up as that's not exposed normally in a container? https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/g3akHyio/special_files.log
