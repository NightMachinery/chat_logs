[16:40:53] <DPA> The HTML in many E-Mail software is severely crippled. They usually don't execute JS either. It shouldn't be possible to do such things even if they did.
[16:40:53] <DPA> But Microsofts special HTML Engines & their integration for such programs tend to be really, really bad, so something like that still sometimes shows up sometimes, and then gets quickly fixed.
[16:44:14] <DPA> Although, they may have switched to chromium recently? Anyway, you're probably safe in that regard, at least on non-ms systems. You still need to be careful what you open, though. If you open a program (those may not necessarely end in .exe) you can still catch stuff. (Although usually not on linux or mac, there the executable bit is usually not set).
