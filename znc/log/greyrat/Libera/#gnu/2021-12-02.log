[09:19:20] <bill-auger> M6piz7wk[m]: IRC channels are operated and moderated by individual projects (the 'guix' project in this case) - i dont beleive that anyone from GNU or the FSF would intervene to force them to change their communication policies - if you want to argue for or resolve your complaint, the guix team are the only ones who could address it
[09:19:47] <M6piz7wk[m]> who's guix team
[09:19:55] <M6piz7wk[m]> afaik he's not part of GNU
[09:20:45] <bill-auger> guix is a GNU project; but GNU projects are generally autonomous WRT management and policies

[09:34:41] <bill-auger> i dont know - but that was not suggesting to contact any person directly - the complaint would be addressed by _whoever_ is watching that "sensative" mailing list
[09:36:47] <M6piz7wk[m]> i just told you that people watching the mailing list are either the person who banned me, coutes who publicly attacked RMS so he doesn't seem to have any interest in helping me and people that are not longer working on guix 
[09:37:30] <M6piz7wk[m]> So i can already tell that sending the mail will most likely only get things worse
[09:37:44] <bill-auger> sorry if you have that experience or feel that way; but nothing will come of it via this channel
[09:38:31] <bill-auger> the only people who could override a ban are the libera admins; and they probably would never do that
[09:38:32] <M6piz7wk[m]> so do i have to maintain my own channel or wtf?
[09:39:48] <M6piz7wk[m]> fine whatever i make my own channel then.. this is hugging stupid 
[09:40:09] *** Quits: zoe (~zoe@fsf/member/zoe) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[09:40:13] <bill-auger> you have several options:
[09:40:13] <bill-auger> * continue using guix but do not use the IRC channel
[09:40:13] <bill-auger> * appologize to the guix team and ask to be un-banned
[09:40:13] <bill-auger> * stop using guix, and find a distro with more tolerant moderators
[09:40:27] <bill-auger> i could probaby think of more options; but those are a good starting point
[09:41:16] <M6piz7wk[m]> i want to use guix and i depend on the guix community to learn how to use guix as their docs are inaccurate 
[09:41:43] <bill-auger> you could use the mailing lists for that purpose

[09:42:30] <bill-auger> so does this
[09:43:15] <bill-auger> but ... "this" is leading nowhere - the other options would actually solve your problem
[09:43:32] <M6piz7wk[m]> it wouldn't be a problem if GNU actually maintained that project instead of letting the maintainers harass people i don't understand why is that not an option 
[09:43:52] <bill-auger> "this" is merely complaining about your problem, to people who can do nothing about it
[09:44:41] <bill-auger> the reason is that GNU wants projects to be maximally automomous - it has been so since the beginning
[09:44:45] <M6piz7wk[m]> So if more people complained would that be actionable? Bcs i got 18 people to try guix and majority has similar negative experience

[09:53:59] <bill-auger> again that is email though - email is the standard for communications among GNU and GNU projects - if you do not use email, you will not get very far, in dealing with GNU or most GNU projects
[09:55:37] <bill-auger> ie: nothing important happens on IRC - if any important issue is raised on IRC, it would probebly become a mailing list discussion on some list, before any action would be taken to address it

[12:56:50] <bill-auger> FWIW, i see nothing novel in that article - that workflow appears to be pretty much universal for "everyone who uses IRC" - its merely advising about commonly accepted communication norms to people lacking any background on the subject (IRC is asyncrhonous, dont expect anything, real work happens on mailing lists) - it is good advice though (it is essentially what i was just explaining) - the over-all fossie experience would be better, 
[12:56:50] <bill-auger> if there were more guides like that
[13:05:57] *** Joins: alextee (~alextee@zrythm/alex)
[13:09:11] <bill-auger> i would add more important tips though, like:
[13:09:11] <bill-auger> 1: the admin is god (accept this subjegation before joining any channel)
[13:09:11] <bill-auger> 2: avoid addressing questions to one specific person which could be answered by others
[13:09:11] <bill-auger> 3: avoid injecting eye-candy into the conversation such as graphics and those annoying matrix "quote-me" buttons
[13:09:58] <bill-auger> tip #1 perhaps requires some unpacking; but it is the one that most people have trouble accepting

[13:14:19] <bill-auger> lemme re-prase that - "most people" have _no_ trouble accepting it; because it is obvious - but most people who are not so experienced with various chat networks, have trouble accepting it
[13:14:34] <handicraftsman> Finally somebody is talking about tip #1 lol
[13:15:34] <bill-auger> there is little talk about netiquette anymore - its a real shame - it leads only to friction and confusion
[13:17:02] <handicraftsman> Lol, iirc we've had a channel on freenode (before it became leenode), where all moderation decisions were driven by a voting bot, and admins intervened only in exceptional cases such as bot spam
[13:18:07] <handicraftsman> You could vote as soon as you get voice, and you get voice by being elected, which usually happens when you being active

[13:27:18] <bill-auger> ... and express the same controvercial opinions which got the previous nick banned - so all that a ban prevents today, is that specific nicknames are not allowed to join the channel

[15:56:47] <nidhoegger> ln, what do you mean? basically I need to choose a license for an open source projekt I plan to write. but I would like to inform me if certain conditions are possible / which license would fit here
[15:58:11] <la_mettrie> yes, go ahead and ask
[15:58:59] <nidhoegger> Is the following statement true about the LGPL: when you link parts of my project into your project, then you must provide a way to enable users to switch out the LGPL part, thus at least you have to release pre-linked object files to make it possible to relink against e.g. another version of my project
[15:59:22] <ln> nidhoegger: well it is kind of analogous to going to an Apple Store and asking the staff whether you should buy an Android or iPhone.
[16:00:00] <nidhoegger> ln, thats fine, I mean I want to use open source and I will release my project as OSS, question is just which license. Currently I am in a candy store asking which chocolate to buy :)

[20:16:07] <spyro251> AFAICT, it doesnt do this for its built in rules, so I am at a loss as to why it does with these.
[20:16:20] <GyrosGeier> you are depending on both the .o and the .s file
[20:16:47] <bill-auger> the %.s is not a "rule" - it is a dependency
[20:16:54] <spyro251> sorry, my bad - there should be a : between the %.o and the %.{c,s}
[20:16:55] <GyrosGeier> with the same stem as any percent sign in $(files)
[20:17:01] <bill-auger> looks to me that is missing the input param, to match the % and %

[21:34:41] <jason1234> hello icculus !
[21:34:47] <jason1234> how is going gnu today?
[21:34:51] <jason1234> we fight for principles. it is a bit more than libre.
[21:35:00] <jason1234> you may have a look if you have time some day ." https://duckduckgo.com/?q=My+Thoughts+on+the+Richard+Stallman+%22Scandal%22&t=h_&iar=videos&iax=videos&ia=videos&iai=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZGF17TbbBcE "

[21:36:43] <jason1234> what is it?
[21:36:51] <jason1234> i dont think that linux is right
[21:36:59] <jason1234> linux is dirty industry
[21:37:05] <jason1234> liek systemd  and all the crap.
[21:37:18] <jason1234> gnu should run on BSD <-- really, unix and liberty.
[21:38:19] <pkal> jason1234: Why are you linking a DDG link to a youtube link?
[21:38:32] <jason1234> because we have no choice.
[21:38:41] <pkal> ?
[21:38:44] <jason1234> people would host on youutbe.
[21:38:59] <jason1234> nothing will be given to people to have free eamil
[21:39:22] <jason1234> there is no email providers, free adn libre. <-- you can be comdamned by right first use of internet.
[21:39:39] <pkal> I'm asking because I prefer html.duckduckgo, and your links seems to not work there
[21:39:53] <GNUHacker> https://riseup.net/en/security/resources/radical-servers
[21:41:04] <jason1234> If debian and linux would be libre aand caring, debian.org would offer free emails, without having to use other google, fb, ms, ... accounts. 
[21:41:18] <jason1234> first liberty is by suppressing all corporations at right beginning.
[21:42:00] <GNUHacker> https://gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html
[21:43:23] <jason1234> ok, let's take an example from above. how would you host your videos and be found on the web? no email, no account, ... you just cannot. you are then seen as a pure hacker or pirate, hack of piracy to be going or saying "free software" or libre.

[21:44:22] <jns> running an email server is doable... and there's peertube
[21:44:26] <jason1234> then we are hackers ... or seen alike hackers.
[21:44:33] <jason1234> the mentalities must change.

[21:47:36] <jason1234> @systemli.org   <-- is quite ok.
[21:47:37] <Noisytoot> You can run your own email server

[21:48:06] <GNUHacker> Noisytoot: you have a gmail accont lol
[21:48:15] <jason1234> google will block any own runned servers.
[21:48:26] <Noisytoot> No.
[21:48:28] <jason1234> if you run your own server, you will be blocked by corporations.
[21:48:35] <Noisytoot> I run my own mail server and it delivers to gmail.
[21:48:52] <jason1234> it does not work all the time though.
[21:49:08] <Noisytoot> It doesn't work all the time even if you send from gmail.
[21:49:25] <jns> i've been running my own server for years and it's been mostly fine - it takes some work to set up the anti-spam-thing du-jour every now and then (spf/dkim/etcetc) - google is mostly fine - the worse one seems to be microsoft/hotmail
[21:49:28] <jason1234> "running own server is seen as evilish" by corporations. to increase the user security of their data ;)
[21:50:15] <jason1234> anyhow ... google will block many free service -- that bsd or linux may offer. we got our site blocked by google for no reason.

[21:50:50] <Noisytoot> and is no longer accurate
[21:50:56] <jns> i mean, you're not wrong in your sentiment, i hate google/corps as much as the next guy - and they do make it hard to run your own email server - albeit not impossible
[21:51:04] <jns> but peertube is a good thing
[21:51:06] <jason1234> it is quite nice to chat with you, it seems that we have more activits around
[21:51:17] <jason1234> nice to see those pages, keep going guys.
[21:51:29] <jason1234> I gootta need to go skating... we talk later. 
[21:51:35] <jns> have fun :)
[21:51:45] <jason1234> join us at ircnow. we get into libre as well.
[21:52:14] <jason1234> ... 
[21:52:54] <jason1234> and replace the huawei, google ... Linux kernel by a BSD one. that would save your operating system.
[21:53:45] <jns> and yes, linux is becomming the new windows in some ways :p but they always had a lot of corporate contributions... but using bsd as an alternative is problematic because they actively avoid gnu licenses in favor of their own license

[21:56:07] <iShareFreedom> jns linux isnt a operating system
[21:56:28] <jns> i thought we were talking about kernels
[21:57:42] <iShareFreedom> you say " linux is becomming the new windows in some ways"
[21:57:52] <jason1234> freedom starts from /sbin/init. 
[21:58:24] <jns> I was replying to jason suggesting we have a gnu-based OS on a bsd kernel, so the context was kernel, not OS. But sure, it extends to userland as well
