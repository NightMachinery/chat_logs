And mixtape.moe has closed shop..  What should I use to post the picture?  I don't want to install an app or transfer the camera image to my desktop.

[11:14:20] <rtpg> Well you can use your version from code, right? (We have a thing of reading the data out from git). For me it's the whole "the version needs to be encoded into a constant within this file". Not like that is guaranteed to be right either!
[11:15:01] <rtpg> my solution to this has been mostly to associate versions to packages or something instead, and to have it in the filename of the tar package (for example), then passing it into the inner program via an env var

[11:34:14] <igemnace> also, passing the version number via env sounds more brittle to me. aside from the fact that it's literally dependent on the environment it's running on (not the version of the running program), in principle, if your program needs to know about its own version, wouldn't it warrant a declaration of its version in the source code itself? (one way or another, be it a config file or not)

[11:36:00] <rtpg> git tags work fine for me, but git tags with sem ver gets you into messy territory for "applications" IMO cuz almost everything is a breaking change (especially for SaaS stuff) and you get a bit of race condition-y stuff if you are using continuous deployment and have lots of merges going in
[11:36:16] <rtpg> and tools like poetry are saying "please write the version number into this file"
[11:36:55] <rtpg> The version number trick I use is also because we use Bazel for incremental testing,  so having the version number file change on every commit will cause cache issues. Instead during testing we use a specific version number that is fixed, in order to avoid this issue.

[11:40:20] <igemnace> ah, well, all true. a) i'm reminded about browser vendors' move to a single numerical version, at least for user-facing display (Chrome 95, 96, etc). b) the automated tagging for CD, definitely understand. we're in a small enough team that PRs and version bumps happen serially all of the time, but it *is* prone to race conditions as you said
[11:40:47] <igemnace> if you're using the version in internal tooling, that indeed sounds like a case where the hash would have been ideal
[11:41:11] <rtpg> Our current versioning setup is YYY-MM-DD.githash (since the ymd info is useful as a human being and doesn't require opening up git to figure out when the commit was made, at least)

[18:03:22] <shapr> oh, you do hashes?
[18:03:35] <shapr> I started with that, but discovered read bandwidth was the biggest limitation for me.
[18:04:03] <wink> I think I did: first filesize, then hash
[18:04:10] <epilys> can't you get file size from the fs without read IO?
[18:04:28] <wink> and for huge files: filesize, then hash of the first MB (fail early), then hash rest
[18:04:57] <wink> start+end is even smarter
[18:05:00] <shapr> The benefit of Haskell being lazy, my code ends as soon as any bytes are not equal when comparing the file contents.
