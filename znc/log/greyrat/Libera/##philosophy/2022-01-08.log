[04:16:53] <evolv> arryana, RE your argument that VR is escapism even if involves interacting with other people...
[04:17:52] <evolv> if we consider an ideal VR that captures the experience of sensations. A hug feels like a hug, kiss a kiss, toilet a toilet
[04:18:18] <evolv> then would you still consider it escapism? And what is it an escape from?
[04:19:49] <shea> evolv: Are you really going to argue that virtual reality is not escapism?
[04:20:08] <evolv> shea, yes, because what is being escaped?
[04:20:27] <shea> The reality of life?
[04:20:29] <evolv> as a blanket statement, I don't think is satisfies the criteria
[04:20:44] <shea> I do
[04:21:46] <evolv> if I'm in a VR and everything is the same in terms of my ability to sense (with the senses like touch, taste, hear, smell, see), movement, things like that
[04:22:07] <evolv> and I interact with real people also using VR
[04:22:20] <shea> In what way is this still not within the realm of escapism/
[04:22:22] <evolv> how much different is that from real life?
[04:22:56] <evolv> the difference may be a matter of aesthetics and, perhaps, invulnerability to being killed
[04:22:57] <shea> Well first, its an imitation. And, secondly, its another life
[04:23:13] <shea> What do you mean "perhaps"? That's a big distinction
[04:23:17] <shea> That's a fundamental distinction
[04:23:31] <evolv> is there value in life because someone can murder you or you can be hit by a car?
[04:23:56] <evolv> is what we're doing not part of real life? You and I having this conversation
[04:24:40] <shea> I'm sorry, but even if you managed to create a virtual reality that mirrors your own life 1:1, it is still escapism but the mere fact that you now have two "lives" rather than one. That alters the stakes fundamentally
[04:24:58] <evolv> why would I have to live two lives?
[04:24:59] <shea> You are escaping one life for the other. Don't get caught up on the connotation of the word
[04:25:23] <evolv> I am using the existing life to do something else with it
[04:25:35] <evolv> like interacting with people I normally would not have access to otherwise
[04:25:57] <shea> In the simulation of another world
[04:26:06] <evolv> so?

[04:26:14] <ro-bot-o> [url] Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal - 2013-11-22 | www.smbc-comics.com
[04:26:15] <shea> So? It's escapism
[04:26:20] <evolv> escapism from what?
[04:26:42] <shea> Reality
[04:26:54] <evolv> that version of VR I mentioned is reality
[04:27:07] <evolv> everything I do there is no different than here except aesthetic differences
[04:27:15] <shea> It is still different
[04:27:35] <evolv> so is living in a house rather than out in the wilderness, yet we don't call that escapism
[04:27:44] <shea> Some might
[04:28:44] <shea> In any case, virtual reality as its actually used is escapism. What's the point of your little hypothetical?
[04:28:45] <evolv> most of our window to the world comes from passive absorption from media, printed, online, television
[04:29:42] <evolv> if my hypothetical doesn't satisfy the escapism criteria, then VR has the possibility of being identical to our experiences off of it
[04:30:17] <shea> Those two things seem unrelated to each other
[04:30:35] <krb> if information has weight, what is reality?
[04:31:05] <krb> i mean, if information has mass
[04:31:06] <shea> This is just another rehash of the brain in the vat thought experiment
[04:31:39] <krb> what set the universe as it is, if not information?

[04:33:08] <shea> Very profound...
[04:35:10] <evolv> rehash or not, I'm probing what is considered the value of life
[04:35:22] <krb> what makes a higgs field?
[04:35:49] <evolv> what are the parameters in which reality is something to be valued that a simulation cannot recapitulate without some sort of loss
[04:36:14] <krb> maybe reality is closer when one is simulating one
[04:36:30] <krb> if reality is information, then information should be considered more real

[04:39:04] <krb> *and power
[04:39:31] <evolv> I think of things like I live in a house with furniture I've arranged to make it pleasant. I drive in a car to go to places, or fly in a plane. Going to Disneyland; wearing clothes; watching movies, reading fiction
[04:39:40] <evolv> are all of those reality?
[04:39:46] <krb> so then we have a universe high on dopamine
[04:40:27] <krb> maybe reality exists only because some thing got high on ideas
[04:41:08] <krb> then reality is a high

Only then can we claim the new land for the kingdom.  In this metaphor, the "kingdom" is the set of mental events we are able to talk about using language.
[07:27:40] <evolv> it's not really pop-psy
[07:27:53] <evolv> it's also a topic in poststructuralism
[07:28:50] <causative> what are you saying isn't pop-psy?
[07:29:14] <evolv> language is limited in its ability to describe what's going on in the mind
[07:29:23] <causative> I didn't say that was pop-psy
[07:29:26] <evolv> worse, language constraints what is in the mind
[07:29:39] <evolv> hmm
[07:30:02] <Delf> That's why I prefer to think without words
[07:30:05] <causative> I said pop-psychology language blinds us - popular psychology has an account of mental events, including words and causal narratives, which is insufficient and blinding
[07:30:37] <evolv> ok, I was thrown off by the structure of the sentence
[07:30:42] <causative> we have to step outside that pop-psy narrative, accept the existence of feelings for which we don't have words, in order to bring our introspection to the next level
[07:30:46] <evolv> I now understand your intent
[07:30:59] <causative> :)
[07:31:26] <evolv> so poststructuralism comment I made is relevant
[07:31:38] <causative> yes, sapir-whorf kind of idea
[07:32:07] <evolv> but what do you mean by pop-psy?
[07:32:11] <causative> language is limiting but it's not an absolute limit; we *can* still think non-verbally if we try. We just have to be willing to try.

[07:35:37] <evolv> it's more whether words refer to the same thing in our minds
[07:35:53] <evolv> take the word "good"
[07:35:58] <evolv> what does it point to?
[07:36:13] <Delf> More or less. There are things you don't have names for, structures, patterns or maybe there are names but you've not come across them
[07:36:23] <evolv> some people usually interpret it as "acceptable," "adequate"
[07:36:34] <evolv> others, "excellent, superb"
[07:36:55] <Delf> And the definitions of all those are all different from one individual to another
[07:36:58] <causative> to understand meaning we have to understand mental causation; what does Joe mean when he says the sandwich is "good"?  Well, to answer that, we ask what caused Joe to say it was "good."
[07:37:12] <causative> the mental cause includes the meaning
[07:37:24] <evolv> when we string words and phrases together, the differences accumulate where misunderstandings occur
[07:37:38] <Delf> That's one angle to work at
[07:38:01] <causative> for example, the sandwich likely stimulated a certain area of Joe's brain creating a certain kind of pleasure
[07:38:10] <causative> and this stimulation led to his saying "good"
[07:38:55] <causative> so what his utterance meant, is that this particular area of his brain was stimulated, and that this stimulation was sufficient to fulfill his definition of "good"
[07:39:04] <causative> hence the utterance
[07:39:20] <evolv> when we talk to each other about events in our lives that have a particular meaning to us
[07:39:47] <evolv> how we describe those events invokes words, phrases, with specific meanings to each party
[07:39:59] <Delf> So now we know that Joe doesn't eat healthy sandwich unless it tastes good
[07:40:18] <evolv> the intensity of those events get lost in translation if the other party carries a different emotional wait to those words and phrases
[07:40:35] <evolv> emotional weight*
[07:40:41] <causative> when we think about whether we will use a word, like "good," what happens first is that we initially have some mental events. Then we ask whether these events are sufficient to fulfill the conditions for using the word. If so, we use the word. And the meaning of the word is the conditions that needed to be fulfilled before we would use it.

[07:41:55] <evolv> then you eat it and it's bland, you might say, "Joe, I thought you said this was good!"
[07:42:11] <evolv> he might respond, "yes, it is satisfying"
[07:42:17] <evolv> not "it is delicious"
[07:42:37] <causative> yes
[07:43:08] <Delf> It is hard to both be emotions, observe them and try to understand them
[07:43:58] <Delf> That's more than "both" :P
[07:43:59] <causative> in that case Joe's conditions for using the word "good" were different from yours - which made the causal chain leading up to his use of the word different from what yours would be
[07:44:07] <causative> which made his meaning different from yours
[07:45:20] <causative> the (intended) meaning of a word is the definition in the mind of the speaker that the speaker used to decide that the word was appropriate
[07:45:25] <Delf> This is why you're more interested in what someone means by something

[07:46:45] <causative> there can be other meanings, like the received meaning of the word
[07:47:15] <causative> which could be different for each listener
[07:47:24] <Delf> Most likely is
[07:47:41] <causative> so when someone speaks a word, there isn't a single meaning - there's the intended meaning and a variety of received meanings
[07:47:54] <causative> and sometimes even the intended meaning can be multiple, if there is subtext
[07:48:23] <Delf> Yes, and then you can let the receiver pick what they like/prefer :P

[10:06:30] <evolv> guilt is a consequence
[10:06:41] <Delf> The way I see it, it all boils down ONE simple thing. Your values and your sense of self
[10:06:52] <evolv> a lot of people who kill feel guilty and it haunts them for life
[10:08:15] <arryana> evolv, let me ask you one question, in answer to your own.
[10:08:41] <arryana> do you think sitting with your vr headset on watching a vr fire will keep you warm
[10:08:42] <arryana> ?
[10:09:42] <evolv> arryana, my hypothetical was more immersive. You'd feel the head from the fire
[10:09:48] <evolv> so it'd be more than a headset
[10:10:26] <Ungwelian> Being ignored can feel very brutal.
[10:11:17] <Delf> Do I suck at it? Assertiveness
[10:11:42] <arryana> you're trying to tell me that if it's -2 wherever you are, you will be warmed by a digital imaginary fire?
[10:11:44] <Delf> Ungwelian: Yes, like if you're going to pretend I don't live. I'm not going to pretend that you're alive!
[10:11:52] <Ungwelian> I don't know. Are you able to set up and maintain boundaries?
[10:12:14] <Ungwelian> Such as behaviour that you won't accept, with clear consequences to it.
[10:12:22] <Ungwelian> And do you also communicate your boundaries clearly?

[10:17:45] <Ungwelian> As long as you're trying to understand the problem, you continue to be involved with the person.

[11:56:03] * arryana googles
[11:56:42] <arryana> Deer, elk, moose and reindeers are physically similar to each other due to the fact that they are part of the same family, the Cervidae family.
[11:57:10] <Delf> Do you think I could read the short essay you wrote on dishonesty, Lumine?

[11:57:45] <Lumine> Delf: I don't have it on my accessible hard drives right now, and I took my website off temporarily
[11:57:52] <pussipupu> reindeer are much smaller, and are same species as caribou but different subspecies

[11:58:34] <pussipupu> Ahh, so that's the confusion
[11:58:35] <Delf> That's unfortunate
[11:58:56] <pussipupu> you call elk moose because you call something else elk
[11:59:12] <Lumine> But I can tell it in a nutshell, the pertinent point: don't be dishonest
[11:59:28] <pussipupu> animal words are always particularly tricky for this, especially when they're discovered pre rapid communications
[12:00:20] <arryana> ahh, i see the issue
[12:00:28] <Delf> Hahahh :D I will not argue against that :) I was just curious to know what you know about honesty a little more
[12:00:40] <arryana> to me as a former north american, moose are big, dark, and have huge flat antlers
[12:00:55] <arryana> and elk are lighter, slightly smaller, and have deerlike antlers

[12:02:46] <Lumine> Real emotional honesty is never pretending to feel something you don't feel, that is my definition. Real honesty is openness and directness towards whoever you're engaging with. We can't always be that because we play the self-protection game, but minimising it to a degree which doesn't create false expectations.

[12:04:39] <pussipupu> I'd be unemployable for one :p
[12:04:44] <arryana> haha
[12:04:45] <Lumine> Well of course
[12:04:47] <Delf> Real emotional honesty you mean? This is not an easy thing to do for others will respond possibly violently
[12:06:15] <Delf> Take for example, if I become sad and I tell them why and they can take it as an attempt at me trying to guilt trip them and then they go nuts
[12:07:03] <Delf> Even if they know I'm not trying to guilt trip them, they may still start to guilt trip
[12:07:09] <Lumine> I didn't say it was easy, I'm merely saying what is, you can do whatever you want with it. But people think that an honest display of emotion would be destructive to society and its dynamics. But the opposite holds more true because as was said, it creates less misunderstandings. Everyone has to hide to a certain extent. But we don't have to hide always. That is my big point of the essay.
[12:07:53] <Delf> So... don't be honest, just be less dishonest :P
[12:08:17] <pussipupu> I'd certainly agree that honesty, including emotional honesty, is the right default, and should only be transgressed with specific good reason
[12:08:30] <Lumine> Basically, you choose how honest you need to be in order to function in this culture
[12:08:33] <pussipupu> Which I think fits your central point?
[12:09:20] <arryana> there's not bleeding every emotion you have all over everyone, and that's basic self control.  and then there's being dishonest about feelings.
[12:09:24] <arryana> not the same thing, in my book
[12:09:49] <arryana> if we didn't gain some self control over our emotions we'd be eternal two year olds throwing tantrums over every whim

[12:16:45] <Delf> We could be even more honest about our emotions if we were more emotional mature, so to speak
[12:19:09] <arryana> i'd love to read it when it's posted, lumi
[12:19:25] <Lumine> Sorry I'm running on 3 hours of sleep and I'm wondering what to say next
[12:19:40] <Lumine> arryana: sure
[12:19:58] <arryana> your argument for being emotionally immature enough to lie pointlessly is other people's emotional lack of control, delf.  do you not see how silly that is?
[12:20:09] <arryana> no rush, lumi, text keeps
[12:20:51] <Delf> Did I fail to mention the point? My bad! I'll clarify
[12:21:15] <arryana> there's no point.  and i wouldn't believe anything you said anymore anyway.
[12:22:27] <Lumine> In its current form, it's not very academic mind you, in fact one might even describe it tongue-in-cheek. But I was told I made some good points. I might do some further editing before putting it back up.
[12:22:42] <Delf> Even if I say things that're in alignment with you already like to think about me?
[12:23:17] <arryana> i don't think anything of you.  particularly now that i know you're dishonest.
[12:23:27] <Delf> Hahahh :D
[12:24:56] <Delf> To admit that one is pretending... there is honesty there, isn't it?
[12:25:05] <arryana> what i was interested in before was your perspective.  but now it's irrelevent to me as pointless
[12:25:15] <Delf> That's alright mate
[12:25:24] <arryana> it has no value, as it has no basis in honesty

[12:36:32] <Lumine> Incidentally, the word honesty comes from the French word which means 'honorable action' originally. In that you are honoring someone or something.

[12:44:37] <arryana> i mean, the original statement was tantamount to 'anytime anyone ever thinks i'm being unpleasant or wrong, i'm just pretending to be' is merely self serving
[12:44:44] <Delf> Openly dishonest? You mean when I'm honest enough to let people know that I'm pretending to be unstable person?

[13:01:24] <Ungwelian> At least, if I guess correctly.
[13:01:29] <Ungwelian> And it's very normal.
[13:01:58] <Lumine> Well, there's the two commissions but the first of them I'll start working on next week, arryana. Other than that I have a personal piece too that I'm putting together.
[13:02:22] <Ungwelian> People soften difficult issues with various ways, and manners of behaviour can be customed to difficult issues as shields.

[13:24:24] <Ungwelian> "Nair Ml Jacket Women Evening Sand Melange"
[13:24:33] <Ungwelian> "Kento Hs Hooded Jacket Men Dark Radiant-dark Ch"

[13:26:13] <Lumine> arryana: I agree
[13:27:08] <Lumine> But asceticism essentially tries to overcome the problem of pain with more pain, which is like putting out a fire with more fire. Does materialism address the problem of pain in any way?

[13:45:36] <arryana> if i have the choice between liars and fools, i prefer the company of fools.
[13:45:59] <arryana> both are unreliable, but liars are often also fools, as they think they're putting their lies over on people, but people generally know it and don't say so.
[13:47:15] <arryana> the world has no shortage of either category, unfortunately

[13:56:07] <Lumine> There are people who have what I call 'the strip naked' policy. When their honesty is challenged, instead of retreating to a cocoon, they strip it all bare to see. In other words, they become completely transparent.
[13:56:36] <arryana> anyone can learn.  but it takes honesty and ownership to learn.
[13:57:24] <arryana> lying hamstrings anyone from learning.
[13:57:36] <arryana> same as making excuses instead of progress
[13:57:41] <arryana> everyone starts by failing

[14:49:54] <Lumine> How about this: is boredom a necessary counterpart for action? I mean, we obviously need rest, but do we need to be bored also occasionally?
[14:50:51] <arryana> hm
[14:51:05] <arryana> i suspect that's why 'showerthoughts' is a thing
[14:51:20] <arryana> i'm not sure boredom is required, but i think a lack of entertaining input is
[14:53:55] <Lumine> I can't think of times when I had something inspiring hit me while being bored. It was always when i was invested in something besides being still. Some people say they get hit by inspiration in the middle of a meditation session but I've never had. Or at least I don't remember. I've tried it to calm myself, and it came afterwards, but not during.
[14:54:48] <arryana> hm
[14:55:05] <arryana> i wonder if showering counts as being still
[14:55:13] <arryana> knitting is certainly good for having thoughts
[14:56:37] <Lumine> You are relaxing and cleaning yourself at the same time in the shower. It's an activity which requires more than just lying down. In that way being still is closest to sitting and doing nothing or lying down.

[14:58:34] <Lumine> One can of course argue that being still is not really being still, you're still using energy
[14:58:43] <Lumine> But boredom is a state of mind
[14:59:01] <arryana> i suspect that it has to do with us as physical beings
[14:59:32] <arryana> in the 'natural' course of life, people need to hunt, fish, gather, collect wood and water, make clothing/shelter
[15:00:05] <arryana> and many of those endeavors require that same mentally neutral state
[15:00:32] <arryana> i think most things that put us in that state are good for our minds
[15:01:09] <Lumine> Yes but there's a distinction here. Mentally neutral or clear state does not mean boredom necessarily. And I specifically wonder about that state.
[15:01:21] <Lumine> Whether it's required
[15:01:38] <arryana> hmm
[15:01:51] <arryana> it's been years since i was bored, but not years since i've had ideas in that neutral state
[15:01:56] <arryana> so for me, no, it isn't necessary
[15:02:03] <arryana> maybe it is for other people, i don't know
[15:02:27] <Lumine> To what function would boredom serve, other than maybe rescue from getting hit a bus occasionally because you didn't leave the house.
[15:02:57] <arryana> haha
[15:03:29] <arryana> i don't know.  there were a few things which took boredom out of the equation for me.
[15:03:54] <arryana> my professor friend who colored so many of my ideas believed that happiness was an attainable thing for everyone
[15:04:13] <arryana> he believed that happiness is the state of having two or more equally appealing possible activities available.
[15:04:38] <arryana> as in, 'i could finish this knitting project' or 'i could call a friend i haven't spoken to in a while and catch up'
[15:05:08] <arryana> and that happiness comes from arranging one's life in such a way that it was balanced with that in mind.
[15:06:51] <Lumine> Well you're lucky. A lot of people do things entirely out of boredom.
[15:07:55] <arryana> i was bored last when i broke all the bones in my ankle.  the need for minimal painkillers still made it too hard to concentrate on much
[15:08:22] <arryana> so reading was mostly out, and i can't really watch that many movies with much interest
[15:08:37] <arryana> i probably don't turn on passive media more than once a month
[15:09:15] <Lumine> Excuse me, I'll be back in five
[15:09:24] <arryana> of course
[15:11:56] <Lumine> All right I'm here
[15:12:38] <Lumine> Also, another aspect of boredom is that we have an entire culture dedicated to make sure that individual does not get under any circumstances. There's instant reaction videos, video games etc.
[15:12:52] <Lumine> +bored
[15:14:22] <arryana> i think that's a choice, at the end of the day
[15:14:28] <arryana> nobody has to turn them on or pick them up
[15:14:44] <arryana> would you trade your art for passive entertainment?
[15:14:49] <Lumine> No
[15:14:52] <arryana> there you go.
[15:15:11] <arryana> i feel the same, except that for me it isn't art, it's other stuff
[15:16:11] <arryana> i find it fascinating that if someone states 'i'm bored' and you suggest they undertake some task necessary to improve their lives or immediate living environment, they get angry
[15:16:29] <arryana> they don't want to entertain themselves, they want to be entertained passively
[15:17:52] <Lumine> That's because they believe they don't have the power to change it, mostly.
[15:20:17] <arryana> hm
[15:20:28] <arryana> anyone can clean their room.
[15:21:01] <arryana> they may not want to, but that's just reality.  if you want a clean room, you either have to hire someone to clean it or do it yourself.
[15:22:19] <arryana> i think escapism breeds the wish for more escapism.
[15:22:58] <arryana> imbalance always reaches a tipping point, though, where it becomes unhealthy/not viable
[15:24:44] <amigojapan> There is also a time and place for passive entertainment
[15:25:44] <arryana> little kids would happily sit in front of the tv eating chocolate all day every day if you let them
[15:25:49] <arryana> but it wouldn't end well
[15:30:21] <Lumine> arryana: i must admit, i'm getting super tired here, could really do with a nap, even though I'd rather stick around and further explore boredom, since i started it
[15:30:27] <arryana> haha
[15:30:29] <arryana> sleep, it can wait
[15:30:38] <arryana> we can discuss boredom later, if you like
[15:30:44] <Lumine> All right
