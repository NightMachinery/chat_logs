[16:12:31] <opal> because fuck drm
[16:13:13] <opal> i need to try krita
[16:13:33] <bugweiser> but... everyone that uses photoshop 6 today uses ONE and the same key, provided by adobe. 
[16:14:15] <opal> so?
[16:18:11] <bugweiser> then why crack?
[16:19:13] <bugweiser> if you have the right to use photoshop 6, then why not use the same key that everyone else uses? After all, no-one can use their own key. 
[16:22:19] <opal> what kind of stupid argumentation are you going for
[16:22:40] <bugweiser> ?
[16:22:43] <opal> ?
[16:23:08] <opal> youre just wasting my time now
[16:24:25] <bugweiser> by all means, go find some crack with a virus in it. I just wanted to let kompowiec2[x] know that they don't need to crack (becouse the activation servers are down and they can't use their own key).
[16:24:51] <opal> ah yes the "all cracks have viruses" fallacy, nice
[16:25:50] <opal> https://wowana.me/files/210915.115433.png
[16:25:55] <opal> bunch of photoshop torrents on redacted.ch
[16:26:05] <opal> no less safe than any other proprietary software
[16:27:28] <opal> 2010 called and wants you back
[16:27:56] <DPA> I'd argue large software providers like adobe have a reputation to loose if they include hard malware in their software. But random cracks on the internet? Not so much.
[16:28:31] <bugweiser> there is archive.org.. you can download the official binaries and all patches. You also don't need to crack it. Adobe trusts you that you would only use the official bypass-key if you had a right to do so.  Given these facts, it's stupid to download torrents and cracks.  If you insist on downloading unknown binaries and cracks, be my guest. What I said to kompowiec2[x] isn't bad advice.
[16:29:24] <bugweiser> (I meant visiting adobe site on archive.org, and that's assuming they *might* no longer provide the binaries and patches publically over their site).
[16:30:15] <opal> this fucking channel and its users continue to astonish me with the stupidity
[16:30:16] <opal> keep dicksucking IP rights
[16:30:27] <bugweiser> anno 2020, i'd be extra worried if bad folk wouldn't have taken an keygen and wrapped it in their crypto-ransom malware !
[16:30:44] <opal> and uploaded it to a curated private tracker where you'd get banned for that shit, yeah

[16:36:31] <DPA> And in the end, let's be honest, the cracks probably just preinstall / hardcode the very same key and don't actually chenge the program in this case.

[16:38:06] <curtsey> Hello. So in my search for a laptop, I read somewhere that an SSD is like mini computer, no idea how or why and no reason to think that I'll understand. Is there any truth to it? If so then does free software restrictions apply on what brand we buy from?
[16:38:34] *** Joins: dot0 (~dot0@user/dot0)
[16:39:23] <kilobug> curtsey: SSD do have more on-board logic than most HDD, but they're still not "mini computer", and I'm not aware of any SSD running a Free Software firmware so we are bit stuck anyway :/
[16:39:28] <DiffieHellman> Yes, SSD's contain a quite a powerful processor to handle data retrieval and storage and they come with "firmware" that runs on them.
[16:39:57] *** Joins: pong (~beaver@user/pong)
[16:40:13] <DiffieHellman> There is no free software SSD "firmware", so there's no real difference between brands of SSD's
[16:40:45] <curtsey> thanks. So the way many of you guys don't use newer laptops because of non free firmware issues, do some extend it to SSDs as well?
[16:41:37] <kilobug> curtsey: I was mostly aware of GPU and Wifi requiring non-free user-provided firmware
[16:42:18] <kilobug> curtsey: but I guess it depends where you put the threshold, if you're looking for computer with no non-free firmware at all, it'll be hard
[16:42:21] <DiffieHellman> It depends, but yes the highest tier individuals don't use SSD's and use free software their HDD's.
[16:42:51] <nurupo> ><DiffieHellman> 'm quite sad that Rossman doesn't allow contacting him without using a nonfree software. <-- it's Rossmann, two 'n'
[16:42:58] <curtsey> kilobug me too. i had no idea that we've reached to this point
[16:43:27] <curtsey> DiffieHellman that's the spirit, i guess? 
[16:43:54] <DiffieHellman> For SATA SDD's, you can avoid most issues by using LUKS as the SDD doesn't get to see your data.
[16:44:31] <curtsey> there is also that issue of not being able to securely erase data from SSDs
[16:44:48] <DiffieHellman> Sadly LUKS isn't really designed to be resistant against attacks based off changing the data on the disk regularly.
[16:45:21] <DiffieHellman> So if the NSA has shipped you a specially prepared SATA SDD, you're out of luck.
[16:45:21] <kilobug> well, if you do encrypt your data at OS-level, I don't think the risk from a faulty/malicient SSD firmware is high
[16:45:54] <DiffieHellman> Yeah, the issue is solved aside from state level things. At most the SDD will decide to corrupt your dat.
[16:47:03] <curtsey> SSDs are so damn fast though.
[16:47:19] <curtsey> and they usually don't fail suddenly
[16:47:32] <kilobug> curtsey: for most purpose, encrypted SSD is likely faster and safer than non-encypted HDD
[16:47:40] <lts> Isn't that exactly what they do? Fail suddenly
[16:47:56] <kilobug> but they can fail suddenly if you do too many write cycles
[16:48:06] <kilobug> (how many depends of the model)
[16:48:19] <curtsey> kilobug but it won't be in the first years
[16:48:27] <curtsey> an HDD can fail on the first day
[16:48:31] <curtsey> less likely but possible
[16:48:48] <curtsey> My hard drive  is still working after 9 years.
[16:48:49] <kilobug> I tend to use RAID anyway because I don't trust hardware ;)
[16:48:52] <curtsey> so i don't know
[16:49:27] <bugweiser> ssd's are disposable things for speeding up your machine (and adding shock-resistance to a laptop).
[16:49:39] <curtsey> @kilobug yeah i've been looking into RAID but there's one thing stopping me: noobness
[16:49:47] <bugweiser> they are fine for storing/reading. It is writing that thrashes them.
[16:50:13] <bugweiser> and almost everything in your computer is itself a mini-computer.
[16:50:33] <kilobug> curtsey: setting software RAID with a GNU/Linux distribution isn't very hard
[16:50:34] <curtsey> @bugweiser isn't that a stretch?
[16:50:48] <curtsey> how is my mouse a mini computer?
[16:51:00] <curtsey> sorry
[16:51:10] <curtsey> you said *in* the computer
[16:51:13] <DiffieHellman> lts: The memory controller on some SDD's just like to fail suddenly - SSD's are meant to write protect themselves after too macny writes.
[16:51:24] <DiffieHellman> Software RAID isn't any geed really.
[16:51:28] <DiffieHellman> *good
[16:51:30] <bugweiser> Starting with your processor (most of them). If for example you have an intel cpu, then the cpu itself is a computer with i/o ports, and it runs on an operating system (called minix) and it has a http server etc.
[16:51:47] <nurupo> no one should be using hardware raid anyway
[16:51:54] <nurupo> software is the only way
[16:52:13] <DiffieHellman> Software RAID is often more reliable and faster.
[16:52:57] <curtsey> DiffieHellman i'll look into that . thanks
[16:52:57] <bugweiser> mouse: not long ago hackers sent computer mice infected with malware to high-security firms, saying some of their emplyees had won this in some game/challenge.  The 'winners' used the nice mouse.. corp was infiltrated :)
[16:53:13] <DiffieHellman> *crackers
[16:53:34] <Armand> Yeah, hackers.. that's what they said.
[16:53:42] <curtsey> @bugweiser no idea, mate. but i do understand that total security is impossible
[16:54:13] <curtsey> that's why my solution is to try to keep my most important things in the real world and not on a computer
[16:54:13] <DiffieHellman> Just because someone said an incorrect term doesn't mean you should repeat it without correcting it.
[16:54:38] <kilobug> curtsey: well, even in your house... every modern TV is a "mini-computer", washing machine or dishwasher if you have one very likely too, fridge/freezer can be, cd player/radio likely is, even alarm clock  ...
[16:54:45] <DiffieHellman> curtsey: Too bad, the government is handling all your most sensitive data with microsoft windows.
[16:54:55] <curtsey> i don't use windows
[16:55:01] <bugweiser> that was kinda my goal. Pointin out that if you would tress over SSD being a mini-computer in and of it self, then there would be so many more components to stress over, most interestingly/annoyingly starting with your cpu itself.
[16:55:02] <curtsey> oh i see
[16:55:26] <curtsey> bugweiser right
[16:55:32] <curtsey> it's a slippery slope
[16:55:38] <curtsey> but we have to draw a line somewhere
[16:55:54] <bugweiser> Thats why people want a talos (with an IBM Power9 cpu)  :)
[16:55:58] <DiffieHellman> Draw the line at a free OS at least.
[16:56:14] <kilobug> I tend to have an idealist mindset (I struggle for a world devoid of non-free software) but a practical attitude, I'll use as much free software as possible, but if I need a non-free firmware for the wifi card, well, so be it until I find something better
[16:56:28] <curtsey> DiffieHellman that's what i did  3 years ago

[16:58:21] <curtsey> Maybe the future is not freedom.
[16:58:30] <DiffieHellman> This is only for laptops that I already have though. I won't go and buy a motherboard with built in Wi-Fi.
[16:59:13] <DiffieHellman> curtsey: Get some old FGPA's and start implementing that SoC you've been putting of.

[17:05:27] <curtsey> one things that's really mind blowing is that they sent man to moon with calculator computers
[17:05:28] <DiffieHellman> *a lot less than free
[17:05:44] <curtsey> and some of us can't be satisfied with a 10 year old machine
[17:05:54] <DiffieHellman> The computer they used on the spaceship was actually quite high end at the time.
[17:06:05] <curtsey> "at the time"
[17:06:34] <DiffieHellman> It could perform the complicated orbital calculations fast enough, so it's perfectly adequate.
[17:06:35] <Armand> curtsey: I'm still using a Xeon X5470.. Great CPU, but feeling a little tired when facing recent games.

[17:07:31] <DiffieHellman> The main reason why people aren't satisfied with 10 year old machines is because software quality keeps getting worse.
[17:07:32] <curtsey> @armand that's very cool
[17:08:06] <curtsey> DiffieHellman exactly. i wish there was some permanence with computers. it's too fact pace
[17:09:34] <curtsey> like i can still find the first edition of Shakespeare's Sonnets and read it
[17:09:47] <DiffieHellman> Computers keep getting faster, so devs use this as an excuse to make even optimized code and the cycle repeats.
[17:09:50] <kilobug> DiffieHellman: except for a few usage (professional video editing/CGI graphics/physics simulation/neural network training/...) yes, a 10 years old computer should definitely be fast and powerful enough
[17:09:51] <curtsey> i wish there was some analog to that kind of durability with computers
[17:10:24] <Armand> Well, the Zilog Z80 is still in production, as far as I know.
[17:10:32] <DiffieHellman> kilobug: Yes, if all you use is properly programmed free software, a 20 year old computer will work great.
[17:12:25] <bugweiser> DiffieHellman: you are absolutely correct (sadly that this is the fact)
[17:13:18] <Armand> DiffieHellman: Sadly, the inverse is.. that older hardware won't support new feature sets.
[17:14:14] <DiffieHellman> New feature sets? While newer AMD64 CPU's has a lot of extended instructions, gcc doesn't seem to use them by default.
[17:14:43] <curtsey> Armand the biggest question in the known universe is that do we really need the new feature sets?
[17:14:59] <DiffieHellman> You pretty much just have to compile all your software from source with only the supported flags and you won't have any issues.
[17:16:07] <Armand> curtsey: Well, that's a very dynamic question.
[17:16:09] <kreyren[m]> Are software patents still an issue in the EU?
[17:16:25] <Armand> kreyren[m]: Still an issue *everywhere*
[17:16:40] <bugweiser> the new feature sets are supposed to make particular computations faster. And in the hands of capable compilers or human hackers, they do their job :)  If the compiler doesn't touch them and the human hacker is no longer wrecking his brain how a particular computation could be made as fast as possible with the tools (instructions) at hand.. then.. well, you know.. they don't do much :)
[17:17:27] <DiffieHellman> curtsey: New extended instructions can be used for speed improvements, so you should use them if you have them, otherwise you don't need to.
