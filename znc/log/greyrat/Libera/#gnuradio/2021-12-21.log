[00:27:28] <willcode4[m]> Oddly, when you select Pair Mode: False, it still works, as long as you already had the key set. I haven't played around with the Message Edit Box.

[01:49:39] <Yamakaja[m]> What's your jurisdiction?
[01:49:46] <Filliphy> usually 433.92 MHz. but maybe some american ones use 315? (I don't know, I'm in Australia)
[01:49:53] <Yamakaja[m]> If not in the US, 433 MHz would be the first place i'd look
[01:50:06] <radiohead21[m]> Yamakaja[m]: USA
[01:50:30] <Yamakaja[m]> Oh, then also check out 915 MHz
[01:52:07] <radiohead21[m]> Yamakaja[m]: Ok, Thanks Yamakaja
[01:53:54] <radiohead21[m]> Also my HackRF should be able to capture the signal and transmit the same signal using Universal Radio Hacker, right?

[07:14:57] <linge93[m]> The difference is that it is more convenient to display without waiting for data. If it can be done, I can change some settings in GRC (such as modulation mode) without exiting the current GUI interface
[07:22:42] <muaddib[m]> I’m not sure what your application is. Can you change modulation mode with a gui widget?
[07:31:01] <linge93[m]> Of course, but what I send is pictures. It is limited. When I determine the modulation mode, I can't change it at will until it is transmitted, because I have a receiver to recover the images. They are transmitted and received through USRP on two computers. When I send the second picture but adopt another modulation mode, I need to change the modulation mode of the transmitter. If I turn off the current GRC and manually change the value of
[07:31:01] <linge93[m]> "variable" to change the modulation mode, it looks stupid. Of course, it can be used for literature writing, and the on-site demonstration effect is not good
[07:32:42] <linge93[m]> So if I can control the program running in the GUI and change the system settings, it will be very good

The traditional demodulation techniques are design to do the best demodulation over a AWGN channel, I want to find a channel where the neural network outperforms the traditional demodulation techniques. I asked about a channel with mean different from 0 because I know that in that kind of channel the neuronal network can outperform the
[20:53:13] <luisherasme[m]> traditional techniques because it also learns continually while the message is being transmitted. 
[20:53:13] <luisherasme[m]> The neural network uses the position of the symbol in the constellation diagram to demodulate, and the preamble of the frame is used to continually learn about the channel.
[20:54:46] <Yamakaja[m]> Well, there are all kinds of weird channels, but communications engineers have also developed lots of tools to transform weird channels into awgn channels which can be demodulated using the normal ML (Maximum likelihood) approach
