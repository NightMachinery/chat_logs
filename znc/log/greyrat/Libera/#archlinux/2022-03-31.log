[00:07:48] <mrenkey> Why does arch linux use md5/sha1 digests for iso's? It is deprecated!
[00:08:29] <mrenkey> Will be good if use sha256/sha512 or even better sha3-512
[00:08:30] <Earnestly> How else can arch provide modified isos without you noticing?
[00:09:02] <mrenkey> ?
[00:09:12] <Ghosthree3> probably should use something not broken but if you download it as a torrent it will be hash confirmed anyway

[03:35:31] <Namarrgon> the DE doesn't really matter
[03:36:48] <Ryu945> Namarrgon: It isn't just about that.  I am talking about other changes that make Wine run faster.   For example, I heard distros that use Xorg are far more inefficient at running Wine then distros that run Wayland.

[03:40:17] <Namarrgon> i don't play LoL but the regression is possibly due to game updates, not the used distro

[13:41:22] <mpan> ↑ that was an issue in the past, as it couldn’t detect latency. But not anymore, with pacman’s parallel downloads making that issue hugely irrelevant.
[13:41:38] <SysGhost> I prefer local mirrors even if they're not topping the list, as they tend to be more reliable due to the locality.
[13:43:05] <SysGhost> For instance I can get german and french mirrors as the "fastest" here in Sweden. But they tend to be "fast" only at certain times of the day.
[13:44:06] <susi> btw, what's your ParallelDownloads set to, I have it 5, which I think is quite optimal for my network and configuration

[13:44:26] <SysGhost> many mirrors don't accept much more than 5. 
[13:44:55] <SysGhost> I did have mine set to 10, but mirrors kept tempbanning me due to too many concurrent connections.
[13:44:55] <Gagis> whats the default? I think all my conf files predate that feature

[13:46:46] <mpan> SysGhost: mirrors may not share the same versions of packages, so you would experience 404s.
[13:47:03] <SysGhost> true. But that I can hit anyway
[13:47:27] <SysGhost> it solves itself as it jumps to the next mirror in the list anyway.
[13:47:57] <SysGhost> if I get far too many 404's I ethier have to sync, or refresh the mirrorlist.
[13:48:04] <mpan> Also: in the end, globally, you cause not lesser load.
[13:49:18] <SysGhost> of course. it's a balance of time spent downloading versus bandwidth usage.
[13:49:30] <Edu4rdSHL> bladerunner1, use the mirror from https://cloudflaremirrors.com and all your mirror speed issues are gone
[13:49:32] <phrik> Title: Cloudflare Mirrors (at cloudflaremirrors.com)
[13:49:43] <SysGhost> I suspect that spending a much shorter time downloading stuff is better in the long run.

[13:54:04] <SysGhost> Neat. Using cloudflare to "generate" a mirrorlist on their end. Although personally I prefer to keep my mirrorlist semi-static where I can rearrange and/or remove/add servers as I see fit. But that's me.

[18:07:53] <fruity_tomato> so, in Windows File Explorer file picker, you could put in a URL and it would "download" the file and open it as if you've opened it on your computer. This is useful when you want to directly upload a video/gif to slack or wherever.
[18:08:11] <fruity_tomato> i tried in Thunar but it did not work, is there anything similar i could try to make it work'
[18:09:31] <MrElendig> that kde web browser that pretends to be a file manager might have it
[18:10:09] <MacGyver> :'(
[18:10:14] <MacGyver> Uh, :')*

[18:12:27] <fruity_tomato> MacGyver so, to be honest, it's to quickly share gifs/vids from imgur, if you just put in a direct link, it won't preview. In windows you could just "upload" it via the file picker and you'd get a nice clickable preview because you directly uploaded it

[18:14:07] <fruity_tomato> MacGyver you can, I know it's weird, but it works. It just treats the public URL as a regular path. You can even see the transfer window.

[21:23:05] <sorta> ah i see, that must be it.
[21:23:09] <chronos3> I dont want to use dolphin though, its slow
[21:23:12] <sorta> personally I use nemo
[21:23:43] <chronos3> pcmanfm is generally the best when it comes to file transfer speeds 
[21:23:50] <chronos3> are there any work arounds?
[21:24:04] <sorta> the file explorer hardly makes any difference on file transfer speeds
[21:24:08] <sorta> at least it shouldn't

[21:24:51] <chronos3> thunar and dolphin were significantly slower in my case
