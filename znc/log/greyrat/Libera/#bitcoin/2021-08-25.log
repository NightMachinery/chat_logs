[19:13:51] <EmanuelLoos[m]> Hello, I don't completely understand what is so bad about paper wallets and reusing public keys after reading [this](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Paper_wallet), [this](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse) and [this](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deterministic_wallet). I understand that when reusing addresses everyone sending a transaction to or recieving a transaction from an address will be able to see all other transactions going to or
[19:13:51] <EmanuelLoos[m]> coming from that address, but I don't understand how using a different address each time would change that as transactions are verified by the miners. I thought Bitcoin was not a privacy coin. The wet paper wallet shown in the picture on the top of the linked article doesn't make sense to me: A hardware wallet or a USB stick can get wet as well and funds can be lost that way. I think everyone knows a paper has to be stored somewhere dry.
[19:13:51] <EmanuelLoos[m]> I also don't understand the accidential loss part on the linked "Address reuse" page. I do understand that creating a paper wallet somewhere online doesn't make sense and that webbrowsers aren't the most secure computer programs for creating wallets.I understand that printers can be a security hole, but that doesn't apply to all printers. Is there anyting I am missing? Thanks!

[19:21:10] <belcher> bitcoin is a privacy coin, the whitepaper had a whole section dedicated to privacy, its incorrect to say that bitcoin isnt created with privacy in mind or that it cant be used privately
[19:21:41] <belcher> hardware wallets or USB sticks are also not very good on their own, you'd still need a backup seed phrase
[19:22:34] <belcher> usb sticks in particular arent very good at all https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Storing_bitcoins#Removable_media

[19:23:13] <EmanuelLoos[m]> https://www.coinlore.com/privacy-coins
[19:23:18] <belcher> let me know if you have any more questions
[19:23:29] <belcher> EmanuelLoos[m] coinmarketcap is a shitcoin-promoting website
[19:24:04] <belcher> see https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy#Why_privacy
[19:24:27] <belcher> privacy is very very important to bitcoin, and dont let anyone tell you otherwise, most likely they just want to promote their own shitcoin or want to spy on you
[19:25:40] <EmanuelLoos[m]> belcher: [These where my first two search results for "privacy coin"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=privacy+coin)
[19:26:07] <belcher> yes and what im saying is that privacy is very important to bitcoin
[19:26:32] <belcher> and coming back to your questions about paper wallets, one reason paper wallets are bad is they usually involve address reuse which is terrible for privacy
[19:28:29] <muhblockchain> but muh Monero, it can't be that BTC supports privacy since first block (when properly used)
[19:28:39] <EmanuelLoos[m]> belcher: What about coins like [Monero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monero) often called privacy coins? Don't they provide more privacy?
[19:28:44] * muhblockchain proceeds to use a muhprivacy altcoin, of course in SPV wallet >_>
[19:28:56] <muhblockchain> EmanuelLoos[m]: aaaaahahahahaha, 3 seconds after my line. excellent
[19:29:09] * muhblockchain takes a mental screenshot
[19:29:18] <belcher> EmanuelLoos[m] yes but they are less security, their decentralization is much weaker, their full nodes are harder and more expensive to run, they have a much weaker network effect and therefore fewer places to buy and sell with them

[19:38:33] <muhblockchain> I am not sure, but perhaps this refers to a situation where buyer would "send again to same address as last time" when buying again from same shop, and the shop had since already moved coins from that address and  deleted wallet that contained private keys for it.
[19:39:13] <muhblockchain> so simply, the old address is no longer under control of recipient

[19:49:31] <EmanuelLoos[m]> Isn't much still visible in the blockchain? The money spent has to come from somewhere verifyable in the blockchain and I don't think a Deterministic Wallet can do anything about that. I understand how much privacy is lost when reusing addresses but I am not sure how much the opposite really provides.
[19:50:11] *** Joins: Vallenciana (~shells@the.best.shells.pancakecloud.com)
[19:50:53] <belcher> muhblockchain privacy is about the same, but the old-style wallets with keypools are much less safe because they have to be backed up all the time, and if you forget to backup once you might lose your money
[19:51:14] <muhblockchain> belcher: ok, so in case of user error
[19:51:35] <belcher> EmanuelLoos[m] address reuse isnt the only possible privacy loss, so yes some things are still visible (unless other action is taken) but avoiding address reuse massively improves the situation

[19:52:47] <muhblockchain> EmanuelLoos[m]: so then avoiding reuse (HD helps in that by removing chance of user mistake) is just removing thing that lessen privacy. Same about using fullnode and about using tor. To actually increase privacy in  matters of TX onchain analysis, use coinjoin / joinmarket

[20:19:54] <EmanuelLoos[m]> <muhblockchain> "Emanuel Loos: so then avoiding..." <- I'm sorry, I still don't understand: If someone gets a payment in Bitcoin and avoids address reuse, uses a fullnode and uses Tor the person who sent the money would still see what it is spent on, right? Therefore reusing the same address doesn't seem to decrease privacy that much, however, telling people not to do it because it weakens their privacy might cause them to think when
[20:19:54] <EmanuelLoos[m]> they are not reusing addresses their transactions are private.
[20:22:13] *** Joins: safeAI (~safeAI@pc-101-50-101-190.cm.vtr.net)
[20:22:15] <ldiamond> But if you always use the same address, people would be able to know everything you spend. Instead, now they only know about the transaction they made to you and how you spent those funds.
[20:22:44] <ldiamond> Say you get 1000 transactions in. Instead of 1000 people knowing all your transactions, you have 1000 people knowing only 1/1000 of your transactions.
[20:23:17] <EmanuelLoos[m]> ldiamond: That seems like random privacy.
[20:23:55] <ldiamond> It's not random at all. But it's not perfect.

[20:25:09] <ldiamond> There are ways to achieve much better privacy with L2 solutions. There might be a way to get full privacy in the future directly on-chain.
[20:25:30] <muhblockchain> EmanuelLoos[m]: I received payment of 10 mbtc into address A, then made a TX wih 9 going into address B and 1 into address C.  what did I spent my money on?
[20:25:58] <muhblockchain> ldiamond: coinjoin/joinmarket are the way to increase privacy a lot onchain
[20:26:30] <ldiamond> muhblockchain: yes, but those require transactions iirc.
[20:26:53] <ldiamond> What I mean by that is built-in privacy like monero.
[20:27:07] <muhblockchain> ldiamond: well obviously. I  think point of joinmarket is to gain privacy when doing the transaction that you want to protect
[20:27:36] <muhblockchain> ldiamond: all of them also obtain privacy (increase anonymity set) by doing transactions (rigtht?)
[20:27:55] <ldiamond> I believe you can get cash-like privacy on Lightning.

[20:32:02] <EmanuelLoos[m]> <ldiamond> "It's not random at all. But it's..." <- Either something is public or something is private. Something that is only sometimes private doesn't make sense to me. I think it would be even more private to reuse multiple addresses only being payed by one person on each address knowing which money can be spent privately (without someone who knows your identity watching) and which can not.
[20:32:47] <muhblockchain> EmanuelLoos[m]: privacy is not really black-or-white
[20:33:24] <EmanuelLoos[m]> muhblockchain: What do you mean?
[20:33:26] <ldiamond> You can definitely reuse the same address for the same person. But that doesn't change a thing.
[20:34:10] <muhblockchain> EmanuelLoos[m]: often the question is, how sure I am that X did Y
[20:34:14] <ldiamond> Privacy is not "Either something is public or something is private"
[20:34:45] <ldiamond> There are different levels of privacy, it's not on/off.
[20:37:06] <EmanuelLoos[m]> ldiamond: Yes, but there might be some who know your identity and others who don't and there might be some transactions for which you want privacy and others for which you don't care about privacy.
[20:38:02] <ldiamond> Using a different address for any transaction still allows you to tag each address with the level of privacy it has.
[20:38:29] <muhblockchain> EmanuelLoos[m]: for the one you care about, the privacy is usually not "100% private", but rather "there is 1/10 chance it was made by this guy"

[22:00:36] <muhblockchain> belcher: so anonset of coinjoin is the number of participants if all have equal value (e.g. easier to achieve if ZKs like bulletproofs would be used) right?
[22:01:06] <muhblockchain> belcher: do you know what it is for anoncoin? first it required a z-transaction  right, and then, still it has N inputs? so basically it would be similar to CJ+BProofs?
[22:01:21] <muhblockchain> do you know how it is in Monero, also the same - a TX with some number of inputs?
[22:02:18] <muhblockchain> e.g. does any technology now exist (e.g. and one day might be in BTC or BTC sidechain) where anonymity set is somehow total - all users or close to that (e.g. limited maximum amount of money they might have to spend - in case of large payments it limits the set)?
[22:02:42] <muhblockchain> e.g. is any technology equal to "like a coinjoin+BP done across ALL users/all UTXO)

[22:18:38] <AndyS2> I'm looking for a thread on bitcointalk.org where people were discussing special UTXOs that become spendable once you know how to create a preimage/collission or something similar (I don't remember exactly) for certain cryptographic primitives. Anybody know how to find it? My google-fu is lacking.
[22:18:42] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[22:19:21] <AndyS2> some of them had already been taken IIRC, others are super unlikely to ever become spendable without Bitcoin itself having a problem

[22:41:38] <s17> i think google-fu would include their special searchbangs or what they call it
[22:41:48] <AndyS2> IMO you need different skills to get good results out of google and google-using sites like startpage than when you search on yandex or whatever
[22:42:20] <AndyS2> they always seem to make it worse, too
[22:42:36] <s17> ..
[22:42:50] <s17> I tend to search only the words that I expect to be on the page
[22:45:34] <AndyS2> you can also try to ask it questions like 'the tv show where they ate a shark in the first episode and a main character named tim' (I just made that up) and it will sometimes work surprisingly well
[22:45:47] <AndyS2> that's a last resort kind of thing, though
[22:48:10] <nathanael> AndyS2: maybe https://ninjastic.space/ can help you find what you are looking for in bitcointalk
[22:48:53] <AndyS2> thank you, I'll try
[22:49:15] <nathanael> on /search you can search for post title or post content
