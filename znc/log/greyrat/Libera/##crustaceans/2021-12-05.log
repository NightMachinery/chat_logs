[00:23:13] <Brekkjern> ngoldbaum: I don't see the corner case there?
[00:23:45] <Brekkjern> It's a case where you attempt to call a method on an object, and the only thing you test is if it has a property with the same name
[00:23:54] <Brekkjern> The correct way to fix this is to define a protocol
[00:24:20] <ngoldbaum> it’s not really a corner case i guess, it’s an expression of python’s dynamism and how much complexity you need to encode what’s happening in the type system
[00:24:23] <ngoldbaum> for zero benefit
[00:24:26] <ngoldbaum> so you turn it off
[00:24:54] <Brekkjern> What do you mean?
[00:24:54] <ngoldbaum> and this code all existed before the type system existed
[00:25:24] <Brekkjern> This is like complaining that set() produces something that only contains one instance of each unique item you insert into it
[00:25:29] <Brekkjern> This is how it works and is designed to work?
[00:25:58] <ngoldbaum> sure, it’s just totally useless for code that exists already
[00:26:09] <Brekkjern> ???
[00:26:12] <ngoldbaum> but people are going to bang their head on adding types to things for the next decade
[00:26:23] <Brekkjern> Oh
[00:26:30] <Brekkjern> Well, yeah?
[00:26:40] <ngoldbaum> for what benefit?
[00:26:57] <Brekkjern> Type information
[00:27:10] <ngoldbaum> imo it’s all a huge waste of time and massive additional complexity for the benefit of people who are insane enough to write multi-million line python codebases
[00:33:55] <Brekkjern> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[00:34:12] <Brekkjern> I think it is very nice to have and it increases velocity a lot

[01:16:25] <ngoldbaum> real page-turner like they all are
[01:20:22] <manicennui> I've been thinking a lot about why I like the first three seasons of the television show so much. I think it boils down to a sense of wonder.
[01:23:26] <gwozniak> I'm curious to see how I feel about the later seasons, if I ever get to watch them.  It's been a while since I watched the first three, maybe I won't care about the quality and will just enjoy them
[01:23:58] <manicennui> I think my favorite part of seasons 4 and 5 is Naomi stuck on the ship.
[01:24:57] <manicennui> The final season airs in 6 days.
[01:25:04] <manicennui> And it is going to be short.
[01:25:10] <manicennui> Actually I think they are going to release it weekly.
[01:25:43] <manicennui> I hate how they are going back to broadcast television techniques for their own benefit.
[01:26:00] <manicennui> Can they not just do a few things for the benefit of the audience?

[02:40:23] <gwozniak> I watched Foundation and thought it was alright. I don't know anything about the book(s)
[02:40:50] <Brekkjern> Yeah. It was just fine. Not great, not terrible.
[02:41:12] <Brekkjern> The Empire plotline carries the show though
[02:41:19] <Brekkjern> Without that it would probably be rather meh
[02:45:05] <Xe> Church: that's how you do it yeah
[02:45:35] <Church> Yeah seems I forgot that heh
[02:46:04] <gwozniak> Yes, Empire was the most compelling part.  The young woman's (character name escapes me) plot line was a bit thin.  I thought the Terminus stuff was decent
[02:46:33] <gwozniak> I liked Jared Harris, despite there not being much of him
[02:55:16] <Brekkjern> Gaal?
[02:56:18] <Brekkjern> If you remove the Empire storyline you are stuck with mid tier acting and storyline IMO. The Empire storyline elevates it quite a bit
[02:57:59] <gwozniak> The Terminus stuff worked, for me, because of the setting.  I agree that the acting was not amazing outside of the Empire storyline.
[02:58:15] <Brekkjern> Yeah, pretty much the same
[02:58:43] <gwozniak> Yes, Gaal.  I couldn't find anything to latch onto with that character, even though they were supposed to be a lynchpin
[03:00:07] <gwozniak> Although I will say I was sympathetic to Salvor and Hugo at the end
[03:01:44] <gwozniak> But if Foundation counts as mediocre TV these days, I'm not going to complain
[03:02:13] <Brekkjern> True
[03:02:31] <gwozniak> I have friends who like Two and Half Men, The Big Bang Theory, and Young Sheldon.  I'll take Foundation over any of those
[03:02:38] <Brekkjern> Same
[03:05:37] <gwozniak> I was visiting a friend and they put on Young Sheldon and -- oof -- did not find the humour there at all
[03:05:57] <Brekkjern> I haven't seen it, but I know the source material
[03:05:58] <Brekkjern> So...
[03:06:41] <gwozniak> I'm not one to criticize my friends' viewing habits, but damn...
[03:06:47] <Brekkjern> Hah
[03:07:29] <gwozniak> I saw someone posting a screenshot of Richard Dawkins saying he found Young Shedon amusing
[03:07:38] <Brekkjern> :S
[03:07:44] <gwozniak> I won't infer anything from that, but it's a data point
[03:09:05] <Brekkjern> I want more stuff like Arcane though. Actual character driven stuff with good acting...
[03:09:37] <gwozniak> We are probably going to finish that tonight
[03:09:46] <Brekkjern> Enjoying it so far?
[03:09:58] <gwozniak> I want to wait to say anything until it's done, but yes, my wife and I are enjoying it
[03:10:11] <gwozniak> My wife *loves* the look of it
[03:10:16] <Brekkjern> Same :)
[03:10:52] <gwozniak> I agree with her. I think the character and set design are great
[03:11:21] <gwozniak> And animation quality is stellar
[03:11:34] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[03:11:42] <Brekkjern> The animation is nuts really
[03:12:02] <Brekkjern> The facial animations are just absurdly good. Everything contains meaning...
[03:12:13] <Brekkjern> How far have you gotten?
[03:12:25] <gwozniak> I have one quibble, but will leave that until the end :)
[03:12:30] <gwozniak> 5 episodes
[03:12:33] <Brekkjern> Ah
[03:13:04] <gwozniak> they are only ~40 minutes so we can do all the rest tonight
[03:13:09] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[03:13:20] <gwozniak> We aren't really show bingers here
[03:13:28] <Brekkjern> I did something similar, just the other way around. I watched 5 - 2 - 2 or something I think
[03:13:41] <gwozniak> I kind of liked the weekly cadence of Foundation, to be honest
[03:14:00] <Brekkjern> Arcane was released 3 episodes a week
[03:14:24] <gwozniak> You were right about episode 3, though.  That episode altered my view of the show (in a good way)
[03:14:39] <Brekkjern> Yeah. That is really the turning point in so many ways
[03:18:17] <gwozniak> We are waiting for someone to show up and pick up something before we start watching.  We're gonna have nachos and watch the show
[03:18:30] <gwozniak> The cats are enjoying the tree that we just put up
[03:18:56] <Brekkjern> I'd say "enjoy", but I had a hard time with the last episodes.
[03:19:06] <Brekkjern> I mean... They are absolutely great
[03:19:15] <Brekkjern> It's just a very sad story all in all
[03:20:10] <gwozniak> I can see at this point it's going to end with some tragedy
[03:20:27] <Brekkjern> I can confirm that much
[03:20:56] <Brekkjern> I don't want to say anything more though, because the way it is done is so immensely good
[03:23:32] <Brekkjern> The memes out of this series is also pretty hilarious, if heartwrenching sometimes
[03:24:34] <Brekkjern> This one is my fav though: https://i.redd.it/2rty4lamge381.jpg
[03:25:48] <Brekkjern> Though the memes are probably mostly copium until the next season...
[03:27:55] <defect> i know they announced there will be a second season, but have they said when?
[03:28:01] <Brekkjern> No
[03:28:05] <Brekkjern> Only that it won't be 2022
[03:28:35] <defect> aw
[03:28:55] <Brekkjern> They are working on it though. That's the important part :)
[03:30:47] <defect> yeah :) usually when there are break longer than a year for a show i tend to forget about it, and then suddenly get a happy little surprise
[03:31:04] <Brekkjern> I'm gonna have issues waiting for it. Not going to lie...

[06:51:45] <imode> I'm coming from a T430.
[06:52:06] <imode> I think I asked you before but I can't remember..
[06:54:11] <cb> i went from an x230t to the m1 air and i'm very happy
[06:54:16] <cb> no interest in ever going back
[06:54:31] <imode> I need this thing to be repairable.
[06:57:09] <imode> holy shit. someone used a framework laptop mainboard to build an all-in-one keyboard-based PC.
[06:57:22] <imode> ...that is so fucking cool. I'd 100% do that.
[06:57:36] <manicennui> Are there any likable characters on Succession?
[06:57:40] <cb> my nuclear take is there's not much to go wrong on a modern system anymore
[06:57:54] <cb> and thinkpad design is defective where it must be repaired on a regular basis
[06:58:08] <cb> having a 2013 MBA was like getting the veil lifted
[06:58:15] <imode> since when does it need to be repaired on a regular basis.
[06:58:15] <manicennui> If anything, the asshole father is the most likable so far because he doesn't put up with the shit of his crappy kids.
[06:58:40] <imode> manicennui: I stopped watching it due to that. there's nothing enjoyable about that.
[07:32:23] <manicennui> I don't really understand this show.
[07:32:32] <manicennui> Is it trying to be some kind of dark comedy?
[07:32:45] <manicennui> His kids are all super fucking incompetent, dumb, and annoying as fuck.
[07:33:37] <manicennui> Is this a dumb person's idea of how large companies are run?
[07:34:59] <imode> it's probably a fairly accurate representation of how large companies are run.
[07:35:06] <manicennui> Nonsense.
[07:35:54] <manicennui> It's not even clear why the family has so much power. Do they own the vast majority of the stock?
[07:36:15] <imode> lotsa money.
[07:36:23] <manicennui> Having a lot of money doesn't matter.
[07:36:42] <manicennui> You don't get to dictate how a public company is run just because.
[07:37:25] <imode> you'd be surprised how you much you can do with that much money.
[07:37:34] <manicennui> No, not really.
[07:37:40] <manicennui> Not unless they are majority shareholders.
[07:37:46] <imode> cool, you're wrong, we'll move on.
[07:37:59] <imode> it is an insufferable show.
[07:40:45] <indigo> manicennui: I never got into Succession
[07:48:55] <indigo> cb: yeah, I haven’t had a modern system fail in forever. Maybe the GPU is the flakiest part these days??
[07:49:15] <manicennui> Battery
[07:49:18] <manicennui> And displays

[07:50:00] <dimadima> nothing has failed except CPU fan/thermal paste
[07:50:24] <dimadima> battery started warping the other month though i guess
[07:52:05] <cb> indigo: GPUs are a common failure point
[07:52:14] <cb> batteries.... thinkpads destroy their batteries p quick
[07:52:23] <cb> my 2013 MBA is like 75% of original capacity iirc
[07:52:35] <imode> how do thinkpads destroy their batteries.
[07:52:49] <cb> bad power management
[07:52:57] <imode> that's a thinkpad thing?
[07:53:03] <cb> especially so
[07:53:07] <imode> got a sauce?
[07:53:10] <cb> experience
[07:53:18] <cb> after 1-2 years they take a lot out of their original design capacity
[07:53:18] <imode> so no evidence, cool.
[07:53:24] <manicennui> We've had a ton of 2016-2017 MBPs with battery problems.
[07:53:30] <manicennui> Battery starts swelling.
[07:53:32] <manicennui> And keyboard problems.
[07:54:03] <imode> well, let me know when you have some source for that "bad power management" thing.
[07:54:19] <imode> other than a sample size of 1.
[07:55:09] <manicennui> ?
[07:55:23] <imode> manicennui: was referring to cb's comments about thinkpad power management.

[07:56:23] <dimadima> yes.
[07:56:25] <imode> I mean, if there was some source to most of that, sure. all I read is apple fanboyism.
[07:56:36] <manicennui> I'm ashamed that I knew that.
[07:56:43] <dimadima> i posted it
[07:56:53] <dimadima> it came to my mind
[07:56:56] <manicennui> As soon as you did the song popped into my mind.
[07:57:11] <imode> I have my issues with thinkpads (who the fuck designs a laptop that needs to be opened with a spudger.. oh wait, everybody, but that doesn't mean it should be alright), but power problems have been the least.
[07:58:33] <manicennui> I lost interest in ThinkPads when they sold to Lenovo.
[07:58:48] <imode> they've not been alright lately afaik though. the day that I can't upgrade my RAM or storage is the day I dump a brand.
[07:59:11] <manicennui> I gave up on that long ago.
[07:59:22] <manicennui> No one is interested in making good products anymore.
[07:59:28] <imode> for real.
[07:59:30] <manicennui> You gotta compromise.
[07:59:46] <imode> I'm hesitant to jump in feet-first with a framework though, unless it's a fairly low end model.
[08:00:02] <manicennui> I rather buy an Apple and go to them for repairs.
[08:00:05] <imode> that's nearly what I want in a laptop, albeit maybe with a keyboard with more travel distance.
[08:00:30] <imode> meh, I don't enjoy their walled garden and their unethical business practices.
[08:01:09] <imode> if they weren't anti-right-to-repair they would be.. _okay_. I can make excuses for walled gardens. I can't make excuses for going after small scale repair shops. their "genius bar" shit is absurd.
[08:01:23] <imode> citing louis rossman there.
[08:02:24] <manicennui> They did make a step in the right direction.
[08:02:34] <manicennui> https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/
[08:02:34] <buttsbot> Apple announces Self Service Repair - Apple
[08:02:38] <imode> we'll see if that turns into a pattern.
[08:02:43] <imode> if it does, I'll be pleasantly surprised.
[08:02:57] <manicennui> "Available first for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 lineups, and soon to be followed by Mac computers featuring M1 chips"
[08:04:02] <imode> available to individual consumers. let's make them available to shops.
[08:04:09] <imode> without the absurd hurdles.
[08:04:29] <manicennui> "Customers join more than 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASPs) and 2,800 Independent Repair Providers who have access to these parts, tools, and manuals."
[08:05:28] <imode> right, that program is noooooot perfect. maybe not even acceptable. I haven't kept up but, again, rossman has some words on that.
[08:05:56] <jjuran> Notice how it's focused entirely on the latest models.
[08:06:00] <manicennui> It's the right compromise for me, even without the repair program.
[08:06:15] <jjuran> It's trying to introduce a selling point.
[08:06:15] <imode> yeah, what jjuran said. this is, on the surface, a PR stunt.
[08:07:13] <jjuran> Want to repair your older device?  You're on your own.
[08:07:17] <manicennui> I think it is far more likely that they figured out how to make it profitable.
[08:07:46] <jjuran> Sure, people buy into it, fuck up their devices, and buy new ones.
[08:07:50] <manicennui> And it's possible that they have designed things in a way in newer products that makes it feasible.
[08:08:36] <jjuran> Pardon me if I'm cynical at first.
[08:08:50] <manicennui> The cynical position is that they will make money from it.
[08:09:01] <manicennui> Thinking that there is some evil plan beyond that is delusional.
[08:10:35] <jjuran> Who suggested that?
[08:10:40] <indigo> I thought they did it because they are prepping for some EU regulation
[08:10:55] <indigo> It’s either regulation or profit
[08:11:12] <manicennui> Reducing expenses is profit.

[14:05:19] <epilys> load your extension
[14:05:23] <epilys> and then open your database
[15:10:29] <epilys> https://github.com/epilys/vfsstat.rs#use

[16:44:32] <epilys> Here's an open source font where every glyph is a butt https://www.velvetyne.fr/fonts/typefesse/
[16:44:32] <buttsbot> Typefesse - VTF
[16:46:28] <Brekkjern> That site is really hard to use... It automagically scrolls all over the place :S
[16:46:32] <Brekkjern> Font is cool though
[17:04:41] <epilys> yeah web designers have a sick relationship with javascript

[17:05:52] <epilys> i am drawing bezier curves pixel by pixel on a framebuffer! Very exciting
[17:06:00] <epilys> even added interactivity so you can drag the control points

[17:19:52] <Brekkjern> Part 3 of the saga
[17:20:28] <Brekkjern> Hmm. I should probably have buttsbot reply with the channel name rather than the link or something

[19:02:59] <ngoldbaum> i know he had to do it but man the shilling for shady VPNs on that channel is pretty intense
[19:04:27] <riv> that's all over youtube, so annoying
[19:06:33] <ngoldbaum> podcasts too
[19:06:56] <ngoldbaum> every time mike duncan makes claims about expressvpn giving you privacy from your ISP i cringe
[19:07:04] <ngoldbaum> just exchanging one ISP for another…

[19:19:51] <Brekkjern> I have an extension that skips all the sponsors, so I don't really know what they promote tbh...
[20:22:26] <indigo> It’s usually squarespace
[20:25:50] <Brekkjern> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[20:38:32] <Church> epilys: Yeah so I'm aware you can do that from the sqlite shell. What I'm less unclear on is if I can do that from the rusqlite itself...
[20:38:50] <Church> Guess it's worth a shot eh.
[20:45:02] <Church> epilys: Okay that worked. Kinda stupid but m'kay lol

[21:33:34] <epilys> Church, heh
[21:33:53] <epilys> glad you worked it out
[21:33:55] <Church> Heh indeed.
[21:34:07] <Church> Or at least I think it's working.
[21:34:17] <Church> Further testing and bothering my coworker to come.
[21:34:30] <epilys> i think there's a way to see what vfs your connection is using
[21:34:33] <epilys> so that you can verify it
[21:34:36] <epilys> other than doing printfs
[21:37:58] <Church> Yeah based on log output it looks hooked up. But I'm not actually seeing data replicate to my minio instance.
[21:38:11] <Church> So either I configured it wrong, or I hooked it up wrong.
[21:51:24] <epilys> well if you need any help I do consulting :p

[22:31:53] <indigo> I think EC2 instance types and Acer monitor models are going to intersect sometime in the future
[22:32:34] <indigo> eg. X2gd and Pbmiiprx
[22:32:59] <bkero> Are you sure those aren't java flags?
