[17:53:37] <jonkri> I'm looking into creating a function. Any hints on how I can get an org-mode date like <2021-06-27 Sun>? I've tried (org-time-stamp '(16) t), but that includes the time as well.
[17:54:16] <ngz> jonkri: why do you need '(16) ?
[17:56:18] <ngz> I think (format-time-string (org-time-stamp-format nil t) (current-time)) should do.
[17:56:22] <jonkri> ngz: Oh, I was just trying different prefix values.
[17:57:13] <jonkri> ngz: Thanks, but that produces [2021-06-27 Sun] instead of <2021-06-27 Sun>. What does that mean?
[17:57:42] <ngz> This is an inactive time-stamp
[17:57:55] <ngz> You may want to look at the manual about it.
[17:58:01] <jonkri> Great, thanks! :)

[18:55:21] <jonkri> True. :)

[19:22:11] <yashasolutions> hey, I am looking to practice my lisp on org-mode, do you have any suggestion of a good way to get started?

[19:32:47] <selfsymmetric-mu> yashasolutions: Yes, check out the Org Element API
[19:33:47] <selfsymmetric-mu> For example I use `org-element-timestamp-interpreter` to programmatically look at timestamps. You can also use it to count todos, though I confess that when I needed to do that I simply regexed myself a solution.
[19:42:03] <yashasolutions> thanks selfsymmetric-mu and yes I agree to count todos there are other ways, but for my goal is to get my lisp to a degree where its decent enough so I can contribute to a number of projects

[19:51:54] <yashasolutions> nice! maybe I missed a few things already there... how to publish for org mode to google documents/
[19:51:56] <yashasolutions> ?
[19:52:26] <yashasolutions> (it's just my current headache :) )
[19:53:16] <yashasolutions> or do you have somewhere where you describe some elements of your workflow?
[19:53:18] <Demosthenex> i write in org, and i export PDFs. i deliver those to my customers both digitally and professionally printed.
[19:53:50] <Demosthenex> i can't help you with, or recommend, google docs or gitlab :P
[19:55:52] <Demosthenex> though gitlab's likely the lesser evil ;]
[19:55:59] <yashasolutions> No problem, I was asking just in case :) PDFs works for me too, but the current team I work with can only deal with google docs (at least the management level) and tasks are dispacthed to the dev team to gitlab (there is a package called org-sync which started to do that but no movement there since 2018)
[19:57:34] <yashasolutions> For now I found a work around with pandoc to docx and integration using gdrive (a golang cli interfacing with google api) but it create a new doc each time, and I need manually to go update the main google docs after the import...
[19:57:59] <Demosthenex> yeah, so org-mode's like engineer crack, factorio-level. once you learn the basics, you want to apply it to everything. addons come and go constantly
[19:58:10] <Demosthenex> or rather, they fade with attention ;]
[19:58:46] <Demosthenex> yeah, email is my primary mode of communication
[20:00:15] <yashasolutions> I got hooked on org-mode a few month ago... it's just what I have been looking for, I dunno how I didn't pay attention to for so many years... Now all my life is in orgfile, and it's been a major to many of my workflow

[21:42:09] <garjola> yashasolutions: for the integration with gitlab, you may have a look at forge (https://github.com/magit/forge). It's a package that sits on top of magit and allows to work with issues and merge requests. Otherwise, using e-mail for responding to gitlab issues is also possible.
[21:53:33] <Demosthenex> i often tag headlines with trouble ticket #'s
[21:53:40] <Demosthenex> so when i make an agenda, they show for the customer
