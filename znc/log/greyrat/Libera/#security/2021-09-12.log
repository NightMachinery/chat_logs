[01:15:42] <KryptoK> If got a chassis for a TrueNas it I would want at least 6 drives.
[01:16:03] <KryptoK> probably be at least 4Us
[01:16:18] <ajak> 4u for only 6 drives?
[01:16:26] <KryptoK> even the chassis are expensive.
[01:16:46] <KryptoK> 3.5 inch
[01:16:58] <KryptoK> if they were hot swap
[01:17:27] <ajak> if you want that many drives, it would probably be cheaper to look for something more size-efficient
[01:17:57] <Hydragyrum> KryptoK, my 1U server's got 6x spots for 2.5"s
[01:18:14] <KryptoK> I don't necesarily want every thing on the same storage pool

[02:13:13] <Hydragyrum> is it a per-user token or a system token?
[02:14:09] <pycurious1> Hydragyrum: My webserver runs as user "webuser" - which needs that token, everytime the machine boots up
[02:14:51] <Hydragyrum> a file owned by `webuser` somewhere under /var or /etc with perms of 0600 would probably be the best
[02:15:35] <Hydragyrum> (the important part on those perms is that other users should not have any access)
[02:15:38] <pycurious1> Hydragyrum: sometimes when i install the webuser, i dont have root permissions - so it has to be somewhere in /home/webuser?

[02:22:32] <Hydragyrum> remember that if it's encrypted either the keys need to be stored on the machine (insecure) or each boot will need a passphrase or the like entered

[02:24:24] <pycurious1> what is TPM?
[02:24:40] <pycurious1> At boot, it could go - get the password for decryption from online - that would be fantastic :)
[02:25:36] <Hydragyrum> pycurious1, TPM = trusted platform module, it's a hardware device that often handles some encryption-related stuff
[02:25:46] <ajak> TPM is a security device that lets you verify certain things about the state of your machine by storing values in its registers that change if the state changes

[02:26:15] * Hydragyrum suggests googling it though
[02:26:47] <ajak> so if you have secure boot enabled then you can generate an encryption key based on the unique values in the registers that will change (and thus produce a different encryption key) if, say, your CMOS was cleared and secureboot turned off

[09:36:48] <aac> hey. Is it possible to brute force a encprytion key (for example AES), if we neglige the time it takes before and after the decrypt phase. Like running the decipher function, and that's just the cost (no overhead)
[09:37:25] *** Joins: farmstatejake (~farmstate@user/farmstatejake)
[09:37:31] <ajak> is it possible to brute force an encryption key? yes
[09:37:51] <aac> is it possible, if i call the decipher functions a zillion time
[09:38:02] <aac> is it possible due to fastness of decrpytion algoirthm
[09:38:21] <KryptoK> You can brute force anything.  Just takes alot of time and processing power
[09:39:24] <aac> but like are the decription process say for instance that it takes 3 secs...to brute force, it would need those 3 secs times a lot..for each decription 3 secs + 3secs + 3secs
[09:40:12] <aac> like there's a algorithm on messages digest, to increase those 3 secs
[09:40:19] <Hydragyrum> for a good encryption algorithm with current computers, the amount of time even for a supercomputer to properly brute-force would take longer than the expected lifetime of the universe

[09:41:11] <aac> yes im not arguing that...i just does the brute force is feasible, if i only cound the decrypt algorithm
[09:41:18] <Hydragyrum> it's feasable
[09:41:22] <aac> yes yes

[09:41:39] <KryptoK> Hash: I that the new material.  The CISSP test just changed
[09:41:51] <Hydragyrum> but for AES-256 for instance, the fastest supercomputer in the world would take 27,337,893 trillion trillion trillion trillion years
[09:41:54] <aac> so ..basically, its the speed of the algorithm plus the overhead to input the key

[22:53:40] <gartt> In fact, examine closely any area of any branch and select *any* project, drill down to the workflow and see what govt workers contribute and that defense contractors contribute, and of what quality. There is no contest
[22:55:47] <gartt> It stems from many things, but even down to basic motivations there's a huge difference. In Raytheon for example, if you're in the bottom x% of performers for more than 2 years in a row, you're out, so there's strong motivation to learn your stuff and learn it well. With govt, you can be incompetent, underworked and overpaid with very comfortable benefits and extremely high job security. Which type of
