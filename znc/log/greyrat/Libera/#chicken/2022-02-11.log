[01:14:45] <jcroisant>  m455: I get the same error as you, using CHICKEN built from source, so I don't think it's a quirk of the Debian package. I don't know much about static compilation so I don't know how to fix it, sorry. Maybe there is a linker flag you have to pass, or maybe something needs to be changed in the openssl egg to better support static compilation.

[01:36:15] <siiky> m455: Hadn't noticed your previous messages; I believe there are only dynamic OpenSSL libraries on Debian (though I may be wrong and I can't seem to find even where they're installed...)
[01:37:16] <siiky> so if you want to statically compile a CHICKEN program with OpenSSL I think the only way is to compile OpenSSL yourself
[01:37:46] <wasamasa> the -static switch should be unrelated to statically linked C code though
[01:38:20] <siiky> oh is it? I didn't know that
[01:38:48] <siiky> but yeah I remember having to use `-static -L -static` for some program
[01:41:55] <siiky> dam is Scheme pretty
[01:42:04] <siiky> it still surprises me
[01:42:13] <wasamasa> -L is for options passed to the C compiler
[01:42:16] <siiky> thanks Bunny351 & all for making CHICKEN
[01:42:24] <wasamasa> the first -static is unrelated to the openssl library
[01:42:34] <wasamasa> the second -static is related to the openssl library
[01:42:53] <siiky> right, then nvm what I said m455 
[01:43:05] <wasamasa> csc and CC have different opinions what -static means :P
[01:43:58] <siiky> yeah, unfortunately with Glibc I can't compile any C program statically :'(
[01:44:32] <siiky> I've used Musl in the past, but it's a losing battle and things get messy when you have a Musl-CHICKEN and need to use system libraries
[01:44:45] <Bunny351> siiky: you're welcome!
[01:44:48] <siiky> I have to switch to some other distro some day
[01:45:43] <Bunny351> csc -static is independent of whether you link with static or shared external libraries, the "static" only applies to libchicken and eggs
[01:47:02] <siiky> the (linkage static) in egg files is for csc or CC?
[01:47:46] <siiky> I remember now I had problems compiling my daemon egg because I had static linkage in the egg file
[01:48:29] <siiky> and with transmission too because it's commented out lol

[18:52:23] <ASau> That's why smart people of the distant past invented namespaces.
[18:53:08] <ASau> It was so long ago that it may be hard to find out who did it exactly.
[18:53:24] <fantazo> ASau: what kind of namespaces are you targeting? foo:compile will also clash
[18:54:02] <fantazo> sounds like anonymous namespaces.
[18:55:20] <ASau> Your OS essentially implements them with the weird concept of file directory.
[18:55:23] * ASau shrugs.
[18:56:23] <fantazo> oh, files. how quaint.
[18:57:22] * ASau manages to have a number of different compilers called "fc", "cc", "javac", "csc" and so on.
[18:58:15] * ASau manages to have all those without Docker!
[18:58:20] <ASau> :D
[19:01:20] <Corbin> fantazo: I'm currently using Nix, which indeed provides anonymous on-demand namespaces with specific packages. I don't have a systemwide installation of CHICKEN in the /usr/bin sense. There's a few other package managers that can do this, too.
[19:02:17] <fantazo> Docker ... it's so silly. that monster so that people can have the joys of images. lispers can only scratch their heads about that "innovation".
[19:03:34] <ASau> It is somewhat funny to watch people struggling the same problems as were struggled by lispniks 50 years ago and smalltalkers 40 years ago.

[19:43:13] <ASau> fantazo: how to manage all that.
[19:44:10] <ASau> All change management that is done today with VCS was manual job back in those days, but working with image complicated it even more.
[19:45:45] <ASau> Even communicating changes is a problem with image-based development, unless you implement some support for it.
[19:46:04] <ASau> It is worse than typical "works on my machine".
[19:52:01] <fantazo> ASau: ah, those. Smalltalkers did things like implementing VCS inside the image.
[19:53:31] <ASau> Yes, but I suspect that they didn't do that at once. :)

[20:23:02] <Zipheir> Does (chicken type) provide anyway to state that a value is delayed?  There's no promise type, and the compiler accepts (integer -> integer) as the signature of (define (foo x) (delay (* x x))).
[20:23:46] <Zipheir> But, of course, (* 2 (foo 3)) causes a runtime error.
