[02:23:26] <LuisP14> doesn't make much difference without
[02:25:30] <kurahaupo> I would tend to use "The police" when referring to a specific group, which would include all police as an institution; I would use "police" as a simple plural, in much the same way as I might use "officers"
[02:26:17] <GuiToris> LuisP14, this is why I'm so uncertain: [Tuesday, 19 October 2021] [00:33:10 CEST] <mdogg>      The term "police" in that context is generic.  That could mean the Sheriff department, or any government agency possessing police powers.  If you say "the police" it means (in America) the city police which is governed by a chief of police within a certain city.

[02:35:21] <LuisP14> it has its difference, it's just i don't see it to be much :p
[02:36:03] <kurahaupo> GuiToris: I would probably omit "the" from the 3rd ~ 6th unless I had a particular squad in mind.
[02:36:45] <GuiToris> what does ~ mean?

[02:37:18] <mdogg> GuiToris⦂ I read the sentences you posted https://bpa.st/raw/WUQQ and yes, the term "the police" in those examples reads just how an American would phrase each of those examples.  
[02:37:22] <mdogg> GuiToris⦂ Another example is the word "hospital" vs. "the hospital".  In America we say, "We took the injured lady to the hospital." and "Our friend is in the hospital so we went to visit them today."  In many parts of Europe, particularly Ireland and the U.K., they do not include 'the'.  For example: in Ireland people say, "We took the injured lady to hospital."  and "Our friend is in hospital so we went to visit them today."
[02:37:32] <kurahaupo>  "to" or "through" or "through to"
[02:39:02] <GuiToris> kurahaupo, thanks, I don't know why but I substitute approximately with ~
[02:39:17] <kurahaupo> mdogg: I suspect this might reflect that outside the US, there's only one hospital service (spanning multiple locations) and one police service
[02:40:13] <kurahaupo> So we don't tend to both focusing on which hospital or which police dept

[02:50:20] <kurahaupo> GuiToris: infix operator: an operator written between its two operands
[02:50:59] <GuiToris> ok, the police are people, eg police officers, while police is an organization

[03:12:04] <Panther> the last school board meeting I went to could have used my rule so many times, and I am sure his Honor the Mayor would have heaved a sigh of relief. :)
[03:12:14] <LuisP14> such dichotomy
[03:13:01] <LjL> Me-me, i would say i've often seen it used (again at least in the UK) in a way that seems to much contradict what you've just stated :(
[03:13:19] <LjL> but maybe it doesn't, i'll ask the police what they think
[03:13:25] <Me-me> How have you seen it used?
[03:14:01] <LjL> in cases where the sentence was talking about the current government making a specific decision
[03:14:15] <Me-me> Can you give an example?
[03:14:23] <Panther> Which happens so rarely, there are no examples.
[03:14:34] <Panther> :P
[03:14:36] <LjL> a real-life one? no
[03:14:41] <Me-me> Okay, cool.
[03:14:51] <LjL> a made-up one? "Government decided to abolish articles"
[03:14:58] <LjL> what is cool about that
[03:15:04] <Me-me> I mean that just sounds like a sentence fragment.
[03:15:11] <LjL> i mean no
[03:15:27] <Me-me> Clearly missing a definite article.
[03:15:33] <LjL> but also i'm sorry i don't keep a library of real-life sentences to prove things i'm just kind of discussing
[03:15:36] <GuiToris> alright, thank you very much for your help, I've read your comments about a hundred times
[03:15:46] <Me-me> Just that that sentence: I clearly left out "it's" at the beginning.
[03:15:53] <Me-me> *Just like
[03:17:31] <bp99> can I say that an area of math is ‘fresh’ in a formal document, rather than ‘new’?
[03:18:20] <Me-me> I don't know formal writing as well, but my best guess is "no".
[03:19:48] <GuiToris> ok, thank you once again, I've read all the available information I just found about this topic on the Internet. It's time for me to leave, see you later :)

[03:20:00] <bp99> ‘don’t know formal writing _either_’ ;-) It doesn’t sound that informal to me, but perhaps you are right
[03:20:17] * Me-me shrugs
[03:20:25] <Me-me> No need to assume you don't know it :P you might just be quizzing us
[03:20:54] <LjL> https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=_START_+government+_VERB_%2C_START_+the+government+_VERB_&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=3&direct_url=t1%3B%2C_START_%20government%20_VERB_%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2C_START_%20the%20government%20_VERB_%3B%2Cc0
[03:20:55] <bp99> Yeah, I quiz ##English every day, naturally
[03:21:04] <bp99> but fair enough
[03:21:47] <Me-me> There's also the perspective of giving my answer in a vacuum; I provide context for my assertion without necessarily linking it to yours. You know ... if I were to post-hoc justify it.
[03:22:07] <LjL> bp99, "as well" may not mean "either"
[03:22:31] <Me-me> Oh yeah, I definitely meant "as well as I know some other implementations of the language".
[03:23:43] <LjL> anyway for a narrow meaning of "formal" i'd say no, but sometimes formal is flexible

[03:24:19] <Me-me> Know when to break the rules, and all that.
[03:26:13] <bp99> LjL: I don’t see how Me-me’s sentence ‘I don’t know formal writing as well’ can be correct in any sense as a response to my previous messages. I may be wrong, but I always thought that you can only say ‘don’t know either’ to one saying ‘I don’t know’
[03:26:32] <bp99> ah
[03:26:45] <bp99> Sorry, I just read your message above
[03:26:47] <Me-me> I was saying, "I don't know formal writing as well as I know certain other kinds of writing."
[03:26:49] <Me-me> Okay.
[03:27:56] <bp99> Is it common to just omit the end of such a sentence like this? It’s still strange to me, but I understand what you meant now.
[03:28:32] <bp99> I would have said ‘I don’t know formal writing _that_ well’, but I agree that it does not mean exactly the same thing
[03:29:06] <LjL> bp99, "that well" nominally has "that" which one might assume references a prior subject... but in reality, it's just a more colloquial "so well"
[03:29:21] <LjL> "as well" can definitely mean "as well [as something i have said before]"
[03:29:22] <bp99> I apologize for correcting you earlier, it geniuinely looked like a mistake to me. Now I am curious whether this is common usage, since I have never seen it
[03:29:45] <bp99> LjL: I see, thank you
[03:29:57] <bp99> you learn something every day
[03:29:58] <LjL> i'm not sure Me-me made a prior claim they knew some other form of english well, but i suspect it referred largely to their authoritative claim that my use of "government" without an article was bogus ;)
[03:30:43] <LjL> "as well as..." is very common usage, and "as well" with the rest implied might not be as common, but it's definitely not uncommon
[03:30:51] <Me-me> Haha! I mean I suppose there's an implied claim of expertise when offering an answer in a channel for asking advice about English.
[03:31:48] <bp99> LjL: of course, I know and often use the former, complete version. But it’s good to know that the latter is also normal
[03:33:20] <LjL> bp99, consider that precisely *because* if you meant it as "(n)either", "as well" wouldn't work in a negative, you can say "i don't know it as well" without much fear that people will interpret it as "i don't know it either"... unless you're in a channel where everybody is looking for english errors :P
[03:34:04] <bp99> Me-me: True, but there are many of us here with a rather high diversity of English skills from my experience. I, too often give advice here when I can, but I am not all that good in English by far… But hey, that’s why I am here
[03:34:22] *** Quits: orbyt (~textual@172.92.4.78) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[03:34:29] <Me-me> Fair enough. I showed up because I wanted an alternate word for "railing" :P
[03:34:32] <LjL> i try to make what i say come with an expression of the (un)certainty i have about it insomuch as feasible
[03:35:28] <bp99> What does ‘insomuch as feasible’ mean?
[03:35:41] <bp99> Oh, ‘so long as it is feasible’?
[03:35:48] <LjL> to the extent to which it's feasible
[03:36:24] <bp99> Ah, okay, thanks
[03:36:27] <LjL> i think there are various types of "railings" but the overarching term may not have all that many synonyms
[03:37:26] <LjL> "feasible" is an interesting word. at least i find it interesting because it's rather nuanced, its meaning is close to "possible" but with a lot of implied strings attached
[03:38:22] <LjL> its etymology is just boring, but English takes boring frenchy words and makes them mean something subtle just because they already have native words for the boring meaning (doable)
[03:46:01] <Me-me> Feasible is a near exact synonym of plausible, as I see it, but with different connotations. I do like the subtlety.
[03:47:41] <LjL> uhm but feasible is about whether something can be done, plausible is about whether something can happen
[03:48:54] <Me-me> I suppose that's true.
[03:49:29] <LjL> or at least it's plausible?
[03:49:39] <LjL> (which i suppose is also about whether something "can be")
[03:50:37] <LjL> i guess both have a "... possible in the expected world a reasonable person would envision" connotation, as opposed to just "possible" as in "not impossible"
[03:51:58] <bp99> I’d better use the word ‘veracity’ rather than ‘trueness’, right? From what I understand, they are similar. The latter feels a bit too… constructed
[03:52:06] <bp99> s/similar/synonyms
[03:52:06] <chat> bp99 meant to say: I’d better use the word ‘veracity’ rather than ‘trueness’, right? From what I understand, they are synonyms. The latter feels a bit too… constructed
[03:52:20] <Me-me> "Truth"?
[03:52:24] <LjL> bp99, what's wrong with truth? :P
[03:53:06] <LjL> i'd say both of those words aren't incredibly common
[03:53:21] <bp99> It wouldn’t work in the context. ‘… other than the truen
[03:53:21] <bp99> ted-tdk2021-paper/       │      ess of the statementat no information is revealed in the process other than the truen
[03:53:25] <bp99> eh sorry
[03:53:27] <LjL> veracity may have a bunch of connotation and i don't really know how you mean them
[03:53:36] <bp99> I tried to paste something
[03:53:38] <LjL> why not
[03:53:46] <Me-me> "Other than the truth of the statement" is valid.
[03:53:46] <LjL> "the truth of the statement" sounds fine to me
[03:53:59] <LjL> "the truth value of the statement" if you felt exceedingly Boolean :P
[03:54:03] <LjL> (don't)
[03:54:14] <Me-me> I mean "truth value" is correct in certain contexts.
[03:54:31] <Me-me> Probably not this one though :P
[03:54:33] <bp99> Hm, actually… I don’t know myself. YOu are right, truth is the simple way to go
[03:55:08] <Me-me> For the record -- veracity is a valid word (including in this context), but trueness is not.
[03:55:21] <Me-me> But "truth" is by far more common.
[03:55:23] <LjL>  ther than whether the statement is true,if you are uneasy with it (i'd be uneasy with the other choices you gave) you can always say "No information is revealed other than whether the statement is true"
[03:55:42] <bp99> Me-me: well, Merriam-Webster lists it
[03:55:50] <Me-me> Harrumph.
[03:55:50] <LjL> !d trueness
[03:55:52] <tinsoldier> trueness — Noun: 1. The characteristic of being true., 2. Loyalty; faithfulness; constancy. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trueness
[03:56:12] <LjL> but i don't think #1 is meant very much as "true" as in "truth", but "true" as in... erm... #2
[03:56:29] <LjL> love love me dooooo you know i love you i'll always be true
[03:57:12] <LjL> then there's also truthfulness
[03:57:15] <bp99> LjL: this rephrasing with whether is even better
[03:57:37] <Me-me> Sure, flip the grammar. That's good too.
[03:57:40] <LjL> oh i just noticed i did a copypaste blooper
[03:57:43] <LjL> but you got it anyway
[03:58:06] <bp99> I did the best copypaste blooper, copying tmux’s border in here too
[03:58:11] <LjL> heh
[03:58:29] <bp99> I mean the grammar flipping makes it clearer for me
[03:58:30] <LjL> well the thing is i had first typed it as "Other than whether the statement is true, no information is revealed" but that's silly
[03:59:57] <bp99> This whole topic (zero knowledge proofs) is a little hard to write about because, you constantly have to say things like ‘prove something is true without revealing what something is’ and it gets confusing pretty quickly (for me at least)
[04:01:22] <Me-me> Something something deny the antecedent
[04:01:24] <bp99> ‘witness (of|to) something’, are both prepositions correct?
[04:01:24] <Me-me> .
[04:02:09] <bp99> an article I am reading says ‘knows a “witness” to the veracity of the statement.’
[04:02:11] <Me-me> I know "witness to" is correct, but "witness of" sounds off.
[04:02:19] <bp99> I see
[04:02:22] <Me-me> Might still be correct.
[04:02:42] <LjL> "of" and "to" are both prepositions there, though
[04:02:56] <LjL> but i'd also use "to"
[04:03:39] <bp99> Well yes, but the ‘of’ already belongs to ‘veracity’
[04:03:59] <bp99> ‘to’ it is then, thank you both

[11:17:11] <bp99> Given my ‘noviceness’ in the area, …
[11:17:52] <bp99> perhaps I can just use ‘inexperience’
[11:17:52] <fakenullie> novelty?
[11:18:07] <jacob[m6> I don't think novelty would work
[11:18:32] <twb> "inexperience" is a good answer
[11:18:34] <jacob[m6> But you could say, "Given that I'm a novice in that area" or you "newness" but I'm not sure if "newness" is 100% formal or proper
[11:18:39] <twb> The best I could think of was "noobness"
[11:18:57] <twb> "novelty" and "newness" convey the wrong meaning
[11:19:02] <jacob[m6> Inexperience actually probably fits the best
[11:19:09] <fakenullie> yeah, I'm half joking
[11:19:24] <bp99> thanks
[11:19:44] <tinwhiskers> naive 
[11:20:16] <tinwhiskers> oh... ignore ne
[11:20:42] <jacob[m6> tinwhiskers: naivete would work tho
[11:37:44] <twb> That has a connotation of innocence

[16:06:26] <k_sze> jacob[m6, I have thought in that direction as well, but it's not like the Japanese don't have a word for "Maintenance". I feel that there's a reason they wrote it that way.
[16:07:08] <k_sze> e.g. maybe it's not about "maintenance" every time.
[16:07:14] <ania123> can someone help me to improve this sentence:

[20:47:20] <fentanyl> The context is, assume I was a novice when I joined some company but I wanted to be a product manager for example, although I lacked essential skills and experieances. But Roy endrolled me in his mentorship program and provided me a guidence and assignments to be a product manager so he "capacitated" me to be a product manager. I wanted to stress that point.
[20:47:25] <moniker-> or are acronyms only first letter abbreviations
