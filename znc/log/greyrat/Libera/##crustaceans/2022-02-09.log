[01:01:42] <gwozniak> It's that important, eh
[01:19:04] <kline> gerikson, we use a markdown linter for the liberachat webpages, but i think thats mostly so that we know theyre going to come out the other end of the html generation looking consistent

[01:37:08] <imode> oh boy.
[01:37:15] <imode> my new manager is in our standup.
[01:37:22] <imode> never met this dude, let's see how it goes.
[01:38:57] <manicennui> I hope he uses lots of buzzwords.
[01:39:20] <manicennui> And tells you that he can't give you a raise until he gets to know you in 6-12 months.
[01:39:28] <manicennui> (Just kidding, I hope they give you a raise)
[01:39:40] <kline> a markdown linter would probably also spot stuff like this: https://paste.pulham.info/conflict-md.png
[01:39:47] <gerikson> lol https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30264591
[01:39:47] <buttsbot> Ask HN: Is it ok to reject a job because I don’t like their software? | Hacker News
[01:39:56] <kline> which appears to be a git merge conflict marker that someone has checked in
[01:40:17] <gerikson> lol
[01:40:44] <manicennui> I mean, it is fine to reject the job. I don't know how big a deal I'd make about Teams.
[01:41:00] <manicennui> But I also refuse to work for any Windows shop.
[01:41:49] <kline> i do think its perfectly fine to reject a company on any kind of principled reason like "i refuse to use microsoft products like Teams"
[01:41:50] <kline> but
[01:42:08] *** Quits: jj5 (~jj5@211-26-131-173.dyn.dodo.net.au) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[01:42:14] <manicennui> I feel like this guy wants to lecture them about Teams.
[01:42:16] <kline> "i dont understand and wont put the time in to learn teams" does seem like a needlessly self-limiting situation
[01:42:28] <kline> like, its not that they have some principled issue with teams
[01:42:41] <manicennui> I do.
[01:42:43] <kline> they appear to be unwilling to put in the time to learn it
[01:42:53] <kline> manicennui, same, but thats not the point
[01:42:56] <manicennui> That isn't my impression.
[01:43:02] <gerikson> Teams isn't *that* bad
[01:43:07] <manicennui> "It makes me bitterly angry when I work with it, the way pop ups work, the way things are (dis)organised, even the way copy/paste doesn’t seem to work the majority of the time."
[01:43:14] <manicennui> Seems like he has worked with it.
[01:43:33] <kline> i mean, i really cant comment because we use teams at work but i just close it an never use it
[01:43:44] <kline> people can email me or use lync if they must
[01:43:45] <manicennui> Poor gerikson has stockholm syndrome.
[01:43:47] <manicennui> =P
[01:44:03] <kline> but teams does seem to work for everyone else, including the grumpy fuckers who would tell me that it sucks
[01:44:06] <kline> and they dont seem to
[01:44:25] <manicennui> Do they use the term Stockholm syndrome in Sweden?
[01:44:42] <kline> so i do think that while teams will have some rough edges or bugs, its probably mostly fine and this person just hasnt adapted to the Teams Way Of Working
[01:45:19] <gerikson> manicennui: not so much
[01:45:22] <gerikson> it's a myth btw
[01:45:25] <manicennui> "You will be assimilated"
[01:45:26] <kline> what
[01:45:28] <kline> sweden?
[01:45:31] <kline> the whole country?
[01:45:35] <manicennui> heh
[01:45:43] <manicennui> I knew it!
[01:45:48] <manicennui> Republicans were right!
[01:45:49] <gerikson> the female hostage felt that the police were actively not caring about her welfare
[01:47:05] <manicennui> So you have bastard cops too?
[01:47:53] <gerikson> well this was in the 70s
[01:48:10] <gerikson> I'm sure there are plnety of bastards around now too
[01:48:20] <gerikson> I've used Zoom too
[01:48:27] <gerikson> all tools suck
[01:48:29] <manicennui> Do you think Swedish cops would do anything about a situation like they are experiencing in Ottawa?
[01:48:35] <gerikson> you just learn to deal with them
[01:48:43] <gerikson> manicennui: hard to say
[01:48:53] <manicennui> I really don't have issues with Google Meet.
[01:49:11] <gerikson> generally people here (protesters) aren't likely to be heavily armed
[01:49:16] <manicennui> We use Zoom for some of our all hands, and it seems more questionable.
[01:49:23] <manicennui> Wanting to install shit and such.
[01:49:27] <kline> also remember that its in a hostage-takers best interest to protray the a certain situation to a hostage, who themselves have a very limited view onto whats going on
[01:49:35] <gerikson> sure Teams is crappy in its way but refuse to work just because of that ?
[01:49:49] <gerikson> doesn't feel like a ... TEAMS PLAYER
[01:49:51] <kline> so "hostage didnt feel well taken care of by cops" i dont think necessarily have to reflect anything about the cops
[01:50:01] <manicennui> I'd refuse to work for a MS shop, so I doubt I'd ever work for a company that uses Teams.
[01:50:24] <gerikson> kline: Olof Palme apparently told her that they wouldn't negotiate and suggested it would be honorable for her to die
[01:51:02] <gerikson> the term was minted by Nils Bejerot who never even spoke to her
[01:51:11] <gerikson> ultimate mansplain
[01:51:55] <kline> *dabs on your agency*
[01:55:05] <gerikson> this was a young woman who had the temerity not to feel grateful for being "rescued" by the nice cops, and Bejerot (a generation older) could only explain it by saying she'd been "seduced" by the hostage taker
[01:55:13] <gerikson> who was a looker by all accounts
[01:55:17] <gerikson> and verbal
[01:55:20] <gerikson> bit of a rock star

[02:28:09] <buttsbot> McConnell breaks with RNC: Jan. 6 'violent insurrection' | TheHill
[02:34:52] <manicennui> Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) criticized the Republican National Committee (RNC) for its censure of Reps. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) and Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and broke with their language on the Jan. 6, 2021 riot, calling it a “violent insurrection.”
[02:34:53] <manicennui> Wow.
[02:35:04] <manicennui> Is he trying to shift the party away from the Trump cult?
[02:39:14] <companion_cube> along with, ugh, Liz Cheney?! :s
[02:44:13] <manicennui> Yeah, those two were censured for hurting Trump's feelings.
[02:44:20] <manicennui> So it's kind of a big deal that he is siding with them.
[02:45:01] <manicennui> The RNC is mad that they are participating in the insurrection hearings at all.
[02:45:17] <manicennui> I think those two might have voted for his impeachment too.
[02:52:26] <moose> The charade is collapsing as we watch lol
[02:53:50] <manicennui> Mitch might just be secure enough to go against the cult.
[02:53:59] <manicennui> He might also be retiring soon. Guy is old as hell.

[03:05:19] <buttsbot> Twitter - matttomic - Fun little trick in the Sunday New York Times crossword yesterday: the central theme clue was "The better of two sci-fi franc...
[03:05:37] <manicennui> franchises", and regardless of whether you put Star Wars or Star Trek, the crossing clues worked
[03:18:34] <kline> man, this bike is a real pig
[03:18:45] <kline> its started stalling in neutral but only at night
[03:33:06] <moose> kline: replace your air filter recently?
[03:33:44] <kline> i did
[03:33:49] <kline> but i dont think thats what it is
[03:33:52] <moose> go make sure it's in right lol
[03:34:14] <kline> i had it replaced professionally, im fairly sure its not that
[03:34:17] <moose> ah
[03:34:21] <kline> but its something to keep in mind for sure
[03:34:29] <moose> well i had a bumper and winch thrown on my side by side professionally and they wired my horn to my winch
[03:34:31] <moose> js
[03:34:51] <kline> the last owner had this out in dubai for 9 months and the service paperwork when he was out there says he had the engine remapped
[03:34:59] <kline> the nights are sharply colder here
[03:35:04] <moose> yeah
[03:35:12] <kline> im willing to bet the mapping is running the engine too lean for the colder air
[03:35:13] <moose> my initial suspicion was just the mixture then
[03:35:30] <moose> and if your air filter isn't in right the intake can be drawing too much air making it run lean and if it's cold... then boom
[03:35:37] <moose> but if it's remapped then that's prolly it
[03:36:21] <moose> my dodge challenger runs badly when it's too cold too... anything below 60ish and it's not gonna run right and throw codes lol
[03:36:28] <kline> rip
[03:36:30] <moose> i know
[03:36:51] <moose> i need to get it tuned better, the shop over here who did my tune had done one before mine
[03:37:07] <kline> but yeah, because this has been serviced out of country and while it has paperwork its missing all the stamps, i spent ~$500 on a deep service, stamps, etc
[03:37:09] <moose> hopefully you can just get your tuning done and solve all issues
[03:37:50] <kline> had to get the oil changed as well because previous owner had a little too little oil, running a little too thick compared to the oem spec
[03:38:09] <kline> again, its because it was hot and the oem spec was too thin at temperature out there
[03:39:27] <moose> yeah
[03:39:37] <moose> lotta issues buying out of country :p
[03:40:06] <kline> well, the annoying thing is that it was brought back in and re-registered, got its MOT (annual service check) etc
[03:41:02] <kline> i was too optimistic to think that, despite all the money the guy put into it, that he'd spend money putting it back to UK spec
[03:41:24] *** Quits: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy) (Quit: exiting 3.4)
[03:42:00] <kline> (its got loads of nice add ons - steering damper, chain oiler, aftermarket crash bars, new exhaust system, etc)
[04:15:16] <moose> it sounds sexy tbh
[04:15:29] <moose> got a photo by chance?
[04:15:54] <kline> one sec
[04:18:38] <kline> https://paste.pulham.info/bike.jpg
[04:18:54] <moose> that thing looks like a beast
[04:19:39] <kline> 800cc, so the low end of "big" bikes
[04:19:40] <moose> is it an 800 or a 1000?
[04:19:42] <moose> yeah
[04:19:53] <moose> but still very nice
[04:19:58] <kline> there is a 900 and 1200 variant of this same bike
[04:20:22] <moose> it looks light though, without the bags
[04:20:26] <moose> is it actually quite heavy?
[04:20:41] <moose> 1200 surprises me a bit
[04:20:57] <kline> its "heavy" but certainly not unmanageable
[04:21:00] <kline> 215kg dry
[04:21:15] <kline> about 250kg wet with cases fitted
[04:21:16] <moose> ok that makes more sense then for the engine size
[04:21:54] <kline> so you dont really want to drop it, but as long as you havent had your pelvis crushed you can lift it unaided
[04:22:15] <moose> i've only ridden sport bikes and dirt bikes
[04:22:22] <moose> so those things you can just throw around
[04:22:22] <kline> might want a ratchet strap if you're not on clear level ground though
[04:22:35] <kline> oh yeah, i got my license upgrade on a 600
[04:22:57] <kline> and the difference between a 600 (the lowest possible for the unlimited license) cut down for learning and this is significant
[04:22:57] <moose> I'm in the states so not familiar with the "upgrade"... do they make you upgrade for larger displacement engines?
[04:25:07] <kline> yeah, A1 license is your starter, up to 125cc from 17 years old, A2 is <35kW and 19 years old ("2 years experience at A1"), then A is >35kW and a further few years experience, age 24+
[04:25:34] <kline> the power/cc split is annoying, but in practice its about 125 / 600 / >600
[04:25:47] <moose> Yeah I have no clue what the kW power ranges are or how they translate haha
[04:25:59] <moose> Only in the context of electricity consumption am I familiar :)
[04:26:28] <kline> i have a suspicion its related to EU harmonisation
[04:26:39] <moose> I really like that idea, I am sure less people due stupid things on bikes by mistake
[04:27:01] <kline> and its not overly limiting either
[04:27:10] <kline> even for new entrants
[04:27:27] <moose> My first motorcycle for the road was a Honda CBR 600RR and it was definitely only because I didn't want to spend money on a lower end bike and upgrade.
[04:27:31] <kline> if you are an experienced driver and >24 years old, you can go direct into the full A license
[04:27:43] <moose> But like I was 20 when I got that
[04:27:49] <moose> And looking back, it was probably risky
[04:28:05] <kline> it figures that the experience on the road and maturity means that the only "challenge" is the mechanics of handling the bike, not yeeting it around at speeds you shouldnt
[04:28:54] <kline> i would quite like a trail bike though, i mostly got an adv because i want to camp off the back of it
[04:29:04] <moose> Yeah I didn't do anything TOO crazy, but definitely had a few moments where I may have grabbed too much throttle by mistake trying to maneuver around something or getting a little too aggressive by accident out of a corner
[04:29:08] <kline> having something to take on the unmetalled roads would be good
[04:29:15] <moose> That bike was very torquey
[04:29:21] <kline> whoops
[04:29:38] <moose> I never wrecked! Just needed new pants.
[04:30:21] <kline> i like the experience/luck analogy for stuff like this
[04:30:54] <moose> I dunno about where you live but over here we have long highways that people commonly drive 60-80 MPH (100 - 130 km/h) and I'd commute to work in that
[04:30:58] <moose> People were really dumb with lane changes
[04:31:06] <kline> you start off with a full bag of luck, and your goal is to fill the bag of experience before the luck runs out
[04:31:16] <moose> haha that's a good one
[04:31:40] <kline> yeah, the motorways in the UK at 70mph but theres no real penalty until you are going 86mph
[04:32:10] <moose> here we have a penalty called "basic speed infraction" which is anything +/- 1 MPH from the limit except if there's traffic prohibiting safe travel
[04:32:28] <kline> thats pretty wild, im not sure id like that
[04:32:39] <kline> i wouldnt want to be penalised for going 60mph in a 70 because of the weather
[04:32:54] <moose> well weather is considered prohibiting safe travel
[04:33:08] <moose> generally they don't ding you for going too slow, unless there's no clear reason and you're really obstructing traffic
[04:33:22] <moose> and they usually don't get people for too fast until you're about 5 over
[04:34:04] <moose> I notice that they enforce traffic laws more aggressively against motorcycles, especially over speed limit
[04:34:09] <kline> here for a given speed limit, you can be prosecuted from 1 over, but in practice the prosecution guidelines say not to bother unless you are going +10% + 2mph to account for the sum of miscalibrated speedometers, speed traps, and driver looking at the road and not their speed
[04:34:27] <moose> ok so it's about the same then, roughly
[04:34:32] <moose> they don't specify 10% + 2 MPH but that's how it feels
[04:34:56] <kline> but even once prosecutable, below a threshold you can do a days awareness course with the police that otherwise has no record relevant to your license, insurance, etc
[04:35:17] <kline> for 70mph, you can go up to 86mph in this system and the only penalty is taking a day off work to do a course
[04:35:23] <moose> oh that's nice
[04:35:36] <kline> after that you get fines and license endorsements -> increased insurance, possible license suspension, etc
[04:35:47] <kline> so lots of people sit in the low 80s
[04:35:51] <moose> we have a thing called deferment, where you can basically pay a small fee and get the ticket put on hold for 1 year and if you don't get another then it disappears but if you get another you will get both penalized against you
[04:36:08] <kline> thats interesting
[04:36:11] <moose> but you can only do that every 3 years
[04:36:31] <moose> but in a 60 MPH zone it is allowed until you are > 119 MPH
[04:36:35] <kline> we have the general concept here called suspended sentencing, but ive never seen it applied to summary offences like traffic offences
[04:37:06] <kline> only criminal offences where there is genuine remorse etc to avoid a prison sentence being applied, as an incentive to stay on the straight and narrow
[04:37:32] <moose> I was driving quickly between meetings and the roadway had no traffic one and so in my car I did 115 MPH and got pulled over. They were like "Just get it deferred, the fee will be $50 but the ticket is $600 if you don't." Very casual about it.
[04:37:44] <kline> lol
[04:38:50] <kline> where about are you?
[04:38:54] <moose> WA, USA
[04:39:04] <kline> cool
[04:39:08] <moose> I was driving between Microsoft campuses actually :p
[04:39:15] <moose> I used to be a contractor there, as a dev
[04:39:31] <kline> makes sense
[04:39:39] <kline> i want to visit the pnw sometime
[04:39:46] <kline> cascadia etc
[04:39:48] <moose> I really like it here
[04:40:34] <kline> you might like scotland
[04:40:37] <moose> There's a little bit of everything in Washington. We've got a desert, a rain forest, the coast, mountain peaks with year round snow, awesome hiking, and big cities
[04:40:39] <kline> we should do an exchange
[04:40:55] <moose> Scotland is actually on my list of places to go see
[04:41:18] <moose> An internet friend of mine lives in Glasgow
[04:41:51] <kline> theres something about scotland that highly concentrates tech people
[04:42:14] <kline> a lot of people on projects i know are in the central belt running between edinburgh and glasgow
[04:42:17] <moose> Oh really? I've noticed Norway is like that.
[04:42:29] <kline> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Glen didnt hurt the situation either
[04:42:29] <buttsbot> Silicon Glen - Wikipedia
[04:42:32] <kline> but it doesnt really exist now
[04:42:44] <kline> and Dundee, a bit further north of edinburgh, is a games development hotspot
[04:42:48] <moose> Hah, that's funny. Silicon Glen.
[04:43:20] <kline> forced meme, but it was true
[04:43:59] <kline> IBM, Motorola, Sun, DEC, etc all had major campuses here
[04:44:41] <kline> its worth noting that all of those orgs are now shadows of what they were in the 80s when silicon glen was really swinging, now its mostly offices in the cities rather than campuses
[04:44:58] <moose> I've noticed a ton of companies are just offices now
[04:45:07] <moose> The exceptions seem to be Microsoft and Google
[04:45:21] <kline> but i think this period probably cemented the disproportionate amount of tech in the central belt
[04:46:15] <kline> we're not a highly prosperous country on our own, most of the towns are considered in some way deprived, and the entire country has a population smaller than london, the capital of neighbouring england
[04:46:32] <moose> Overall, infrastructure is good though from the tech side of things?
[04:46:40] <moose> I imagine they wanted fast internet, good electrical infrastructure, etc
[04:46:56] <kline> so to have major microsoft, amazon, etc offices, a number of unicorns, and a strong games development scene is not what should be expected by the numbers alone
[04:47:38] <kline> yes, edinburgh and glasgow are well developed for that
[04:47:55] <kline> (infra)
[04:48:50] <moose> I will probably be up that way once the pandemic stuff is behind us a bit and explore. My workplace has an office in Ireland and we can work from where ever we want for a few months to travel.
[04:49:00] <kline> but its like, 20 mins drive from edinburgh and you have deprived coal mining towns, the a semi-collapsed shipbuilding town, and a gas refinery
[04:49:04] <kline> thats scotland in a nutshell
[04:49:06] <moose> They handle our visa requirements and everything, it's quite nice
[04:49:58] <moose> Definitely would hop over to Scotland for a few days of shooting photos or something.

[12:57:46] <Brekkjern> Pandas is so shit to work with. I don't understand why this has become the standard...
[12:59:28] <gerikson> remind me, what is pandas?
[12:59:49] <Brekkjern> Python module.
[13:00:07] <Brekkjern> Also commonly called "dataframe"
[13:00:21] <gerikson> ta
[13:00:28] <gerikson> used for?
[13:01:23] <Brekkjern> It's to work with arrays of structured data, but it's all delayed execution
[13:01:30] <gthm> noooooo I love pandas
[13:01:34] <Brekkjern> And it's brittle as all hell
[13:01:37] <gerikson> fite!!!
[13:02:18] <gthm> give me a .csv and pandas and I'll poke the hell out of some data
[13:02:23] <Brekkjern> >'Expected np.datetime64 but got: double', 'Conversion failed for column 28 with type object'
[13:02:23] <Brekkjern> First of all, my object does not contain a double. Second of all, I don't have 28 columns. Why am I getting this error?
[13:02:28] <gthm> and then never be able to pick it up again later
[13:05:28] <gthm> fun fact: I used to work at a hedge fund that was mostly run on pandas and it is no longer in business
[13:05:37] <Brekkjern> I wonder why...
[13:05:39] <gthm> still love pandas though
[13:06:46] <gthm> Brekkjern: the real reason is more fun
[13:07:10] <gthm> at the start of the pandemic the markets panicked, and so did our CEO
[13:07:26] <gthm> so for two weeks he forbade anyone but him to execute any trades
[13:07:40] <gthm> which was an odd move for an algorithmically driven hedge fund
[13:07:50] <Brekkjern> And he couldn't figure out how to operate pandas so he failed?
[13:07:59] <gthm> but he felt he was justified as he had unique insights into what the market was doing
[13:08:24] <gthm> and so he traded away for two weeks, and didn't lose money but also didn't make any money
[13:08:59] <gthm> and the investors looked at that performance and the marketing material, which had promised that in exactly such an event our strategies would make a ton of money, and pulled their money out
[13:09:10] <gthm> so the fund shut down
[13:09:32] <Brekkjern> lol
[13:09:39] <gthm> but that dude had a lot of fun I guess, and has now landed in another executive role somewhere else, so all is good
[13:09:52] <Brekkjern> Naturally
[13:10:02] <gthm> of course

[15:08:04] <edk> It is a well-known engineering principle, that you should always use the weakest technology capable of solving your problem - the weakest technology is likely the cheapest, easiest to maintain, extend or replace and there are no sane arguments for using anything else.

[17:31:44] <gwozniak> edk: yes, I really feel that it not a well-known engineering principle because it is not really an engineering principle
[17:33:35] <gwozniak> For example, I could use my own, home-grown, untested server or I could use an established, well-tested one
[17:33:56] <edk> yeah
[17:35:50] <gwozniak> And I agree about the extraneous comma
[17:37:03] <edk> i think the actual relevant engineering principle is that you should meet the requirements while minimising the resources you have to spend on a thing; that's what engineers in other fields do, but it's hard to apply to software engineering and probably meaningless to even try to apply to writing for fun

Yes, you've got plain text files but if your stack then has some cli/npm/jamstack/js/gulp/brew horror attached to it, with a truly questionable maintainability problem attached to each and every one of those tools, how simple now?''
[17:39:18] <gwozniak> This is the key part
[17:39:45] <gerikson> so true
[17:40:01] <gwozniak> Using plain text pushes the complexity elsewhere.  I have found this to be the case for nearly all "keep things simple" scenarios I have ever come across

[23:28:25] <edk> knowing about things only leads to disappointment
[23:32:42] <gerikson> so true

[23:39:50] <gwozniak> edk: arguably, the best part about my graduate work was realizing just how little I actually knew
[23:40:28] <edk> what did you not know much about?
[23:41:16] <gwozniak> Programming, basically.  And how much context matters.
[23:41:38] <edk> sometimes i wonder if any of us really knows about programming
[23:41:48] <gwozniak> It was how much time you can spend on a seemingly simple subject and just keep finding things out about it
[23:43:22] <edk> i started to get quite scared when i began to realise just how much knowledge... exists
[23:44:06] <edk> like, how far away from everyday do you have to go to find a thing nobody has ever done a phd about

[23:47:07] <manicennui> edk: It is just as important to realize how little most things matter, and how little knowledge is required to deal with them.

[23:47:20] <edk> that seems like a hackernews sort of attitude
[23:47:35] <manicennui> Nah.
[23:47:43] <edk> well of course you don't think that
[23:47:54] <manicennui> I'm not saying that no one should dive deep into things.
[23:48:01] <manicennui> Nor that you should be bad at what you do.
[23:48:23] <edk> but i think you do act as though the world can be understood in terms of some sort of big picture unifying idea
[23:48:26] <manicennui> But you don't need to be an expert on CS to write software.
[23:48:50] <edk> no, but you do need to be good at writing software
[23:48:56] <manicennui> I don't think the world can be understood that way. I do think it is useful to operate that way much of the time so you don't go mad.

[23:49:22] <edk> that tweet quite annoys me; it's one of those things where there's a perfectly good answer but no good way to articulate that answer who likes snappy one-liners
[23:49:31] <edk> like "why are there interstate highways in hawaii"
[23:52:38] <manicennui> heh
[23:54:23] <manicennui> Where does Python even use semicolons?
[23:54:52] <edk> i don't think it does
[23:55:48] <edk> assuming it was about colons, my attempt to answer it would be that it's trying to make you write code another human can read, not just that it can understand
[23:56:27] <defect> in if/else statements
[23:56:33] <defect> oh semicolons
[23:56:34] <defect> nevermind

[23:59:13] <ehammarstrom> You guys don't use semicolons in Python? ;)
[23:59:35] <Brekkjern> You use them to split multiple statements on a line
[23:59:44] <Brekkjern> Other than that they have no use.
