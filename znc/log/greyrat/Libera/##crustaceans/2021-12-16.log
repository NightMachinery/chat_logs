[00:00:49] <gerikson> what's his schtick
[00:01:06] <manicennui> Michael Pollan?
[00:02:05] <manicennui> He wrote several books on food and eventually wrote The Omnivore's Dilemma, which was extremely popular.
[00:02:25] <gerikson> ah ok
[00:02:26] <manicennui> His philosophy boils down to "Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."
[00:02:34] <manicennui> Where "food" means minimally processed.
[00:02:48] <manicennui> One of the most sane recommendations out there.
[00:03:02] <river> yeah that doesn't sound too bad at all
[00:03:27] <manicennui> He also recently wrote a book about psychedelics.
[00:03:47] <manicennui> Botany of Desire is really good too.
[00:04:23] <manicennui> "The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World is a 2001 nonfiction book by journalist Michael Pollan. Pollan presents case studies mirroring four types of human desires that are reflected in the way that we selectively grow, breed, and genetically engineer plants."
[00:06:51] <manicennui> He actually experimented with psychedelics for the recent book.
[00:07:13] <manicennui> I think he had either never used them before he wrote it or only used them once or twice.
[00:07:37] <manicennui> So it's not some stoner writing about how great they are.
[00:07:54] <manicennui> Although I think his opinion is mostly positive.

[00:08:22] <buttsbot> How to Change Your Mind (UK Edition) - Michael Pollan Michael Pollan
[00:10:59] <manicennui> He's basically a journalist who writes articles and books that are kind of pop science/history, but doesn't make fantastical claims.
[00:11:10] <manicennui> Mostly focused on food and plants.
[00:22:13] <gerikson> by coincidence I had to buy a coaxial cable today https://computer.rip/2021-12-13-coaxial-goes-to-war.html
[00:22:14] <buttsbot> Computers Are Bad
[00:22:42] <river> > The kernel debugger kgdb, hypervisors like QEMU or JTAG-based hardware interfaces allow to debug the Linux kernel and its modules during runtime using gdb
[00:24:30] <manicennui> gerikson: I was trying to figure out how this was related to plants and food.
[00:24:38] <manicennui> Now I see that we are returning to the earlier discussion.
[00:26:57] <manicennui> Or is the coincidence that you found the article and needed to buy a coaxial cable?
[00:28:33] <gerikson> yeah
[00:28:46] <ngoldbaum> heck of a storm over kansas and nebraska right now
[00:28:49] <manicennui> "This website is begrudgingly generated by the use of software. Letters to the editor are welcome via facsimile to..."
[00:29:08] <ngoldbaum> also 73°F in des moines iowa atm…
[00:29:12] <ngoldbaum> in december
[00:29:43] <manicennui> gerikson: Ah, I was dreaming about POTS earlier.
[00:34:06] <manicennui> I did some minimal research last night and learned that telcos are trying to end POTS service.
[00:34:29] <gerikson> doesn't surprise me
[00:34:47] <manicennui> And Hughes seems like a valid satellite option but isn't good for video conferencing and streaming.
[00:35:18] <manicennui> And has some pretty low data caps.
[00:35:35] <manicennui> My biggest concern would be software updates.
[00:35:44] <manicennui> I don't even know how large an OS X update is these days.
[00:39:10] <gwozniak> I can't remember what it was for the last incremental version update.  ~3GB, I guess?
[00:41:17] <manicennui> I wonder how much bandwidth is required to keep an Arch system with some desktop up to date.
[00:42:19] <gwozniak> I don't get many app updates on macOS, but I don't use many apps either
[00:42:36] <gwozniak> The OS updates are not terribly frequent
[00:43:06] <manicennui> Either iTerm or Sublime have updates once per hour.
[00:43:31] <gwozniak> Heh - just checked and I have an update to macOS 12.1 that I can apply.  2.36GB
[00:43:35] <manicennui> And ohmyzsh every 45 minutes.
[00:44:18] <manicennui> I don't do a good job of keeping my brew packages updated.
[00:45:19] <gwozniak> I have iTerm and it updates maybe once a month
[00:45:34] <manicennui> I was exaggerating slightly.
[00:45:40] <manicennui> WTF more is there to do to iTerm?
[00:45:47] <manicennui> It should be like once per year.
[00:45:57] <manicennui> For some minor bug.
[00:45:58] <gwozniak> I don't know, really, aside from fixing issues with OS versions
[00:46:14] <gwozniak> I don't use any of the fancy stuff in it at all
[00:46:26] * manicennui starts a brew update
[00:46:37] <manicennui> In 15 minutes we'll see what is outdated.
[00:46:52] <gwozniak> The only reason I keep using it is a) profiles and b) 24-bit colour support
[00:47:23] <gwozniak> Terminal.app does (a) poorly and does not do (b) at all
[00:47:34] <manicennui> I use it because it is slightly better than the built in terminal, and I didn't care for Alacritty.
[00:48:15] <manicennui> Wow. Only one outdated package: go
[00:49:23] <gwozniak> I keep wanting to like Alacritty, but never do each time I try
[00:50:52] <manicennui> Using alacritty did lead to my learning more than I wanted to know about terminal colors.
[00:51:53] <gwozniak> It's amazing how much of a dumpster fire that is
[00:52:01] <manicennui> Yeah.
[00:54:22] <manicennui> This computer.rip blog is something I'd like to read, but I don't think I would do so without an RSS reader, which I haven't used for a while.
[00:54:58] <gwozniak> The background on the page distracts me when I'm trying to read it

[21:34:57] <manicennui> My original vaccination was Pfizer. Thinking about doing Moderna for the booster.
[21:35:05] <dimadima> mine was too
[21:37:59] <manicennui> I need to find a good source for CDs other than Amazon.
[21:38:12] <dimadima> sam goody?
[21:38:21] <manicennui> I should see whether the local B&N still has a decent selection.
[21:38:24] <manicennui> Sam Goody still exists?
[21:38:28] <dimadima> i'm jk
[21:38:32] <dimadima> malls dont exist
[21:38:34] <dimadima> lol
[21:38:39] <dimadima> FYE!?!
[21:38:52] <dimadima> all those stores were so expesnive
[21:38:58] <dimadima> you buy CDs?
[21:39:06] <manicennui> Yes.
[21:39:20] <dimadima> i'd be surprised if B&N had CDs
[21:39:26] <dimadima> discogs probably has CDs
[21:39:26] <manicennui> Why?
[21:39:32] <manicennui> They used to have a good selection.
[21:39:38] <dimadima> not many people buy CDs these days
[21:39:40] <dimadima> i would imagine
[21:40:09] <dimadima> what CD do you want to buy
[21:40:30] <dimadima> slim shady LP?
[21:40:46] <manicennui> https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barnes-and-noble-chicago?select=YAmbSea5OqbimWz8ncisqw
[21:40:47] <buttsbot> DVDs - Yelp
[21:40:52] <manicennui> Those look like CDs in the background.
[21:41:17] <manicennui> I want a decent collection of stuff to listen to. I used to have a good collection, but I though, "I'll just rely on streaming.
[21:41:18] <manicennui> "
[21:41:18] <dimadima> "I'm Slim Shady yes I'm the real Shady all you other Slim Shadies are just imitatin so won't the real Slim Shady please stand up, please stand up"
[21:41:31] <manicennui> I want good music though.
[21:41:39] <dimadima> eminem is pretty good
[21:42:40] <dimadima> what happened to streaming
[21:42:56] <dimadima> (you can stream Eminem, fwiw)
[21:43:37] <manicennui> Why would I want to punish myself?
[21:43:45] <manicennui> I don't want to be dependent on streaming.
[21:44:01] <manicennui> I like owning physical objects and not dealing with computers all the time.
[21:44:03] <dimadima> did you decide that for any particular reason?
[21:44:06] <dimadima> i see
[21:44:15] <dimadima> this is a kind of new thing?
[21:44:28] <manicennui> Last year or so.
[21:44:35] <Brekkjern> Speaking of being dependant on streaming. Are there any good ways of ripping music off of Spotify automagically and adding it to some sort of music library?
[21:44:59] <dimadima> spotify4j
[21:45:01] <manicennui> I also miss CDs with cool artwork and inserts.
[21:45:08] <ngoldbaum> download mp3s from napster?
[21:45:28] <dimadima> can i borrow your sublime CD?
[21:45:37] <manicennui> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS6udST6lbE
[21:45:37] <buttsbot> Metallica Napster Bad - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS6udST6lbE
[21:45:39] <Brekkjern> I kinda want to have it point to my profile and mirror my playlists automatically
[21:46:40] <manicennui> dimadima: Are you just trying to name bad music?
[21:48:11] <manicennui> Vinyl has become somewhat popular again, but it isn't as convenient as CDs.
[21:48:21] <manicennui> I have a few albums on vinyl.
[21:48:46] <manicennui> I saw some band announce a new release and it was available on cassette.
[21:50:10] <Brekkjern> I don't really understand the wish to have stuff on legacy mediums
[21:50:21] <manicennui> That's okay.
[21:50:22] <dimadima> i hope to guy some records soon
[21:50:25] <dimadima> get some*
[21:50:50] <manicennui> Brekkjern: I think the reason you don't understand it is that you have decided on a different solution to the problem.
[21:51:00] <dimadima> manicennui: no i'm just showing off my taste in music
[21:51:17] <manicennui> Ultimately the industry is not providing their product in the manner that many of us want.
[21:52:16] <manicennui> And they continuously look for ways to squeeze more money out of us.
[21:52:33] <manicennui> Although with streaming they are mostly screwing over artists.
[21:52:48] <manicennui> I just don't care for the experience of streaming everything.
[21:52:55] <Brekkjern> manicennui: well, maybe. I just think those mediums are harder to use than having them as files available on some server i control and can download to the device I want to have them available on
[21:52:57] <gwozniak> I buy all my music on Bandcamp these days
[21:53:10] <gwozniak> I get a CD occasionally
[21:53:28] <gwozniak> But I don't have the space to hold CDs and such
[21:53:43] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Yes, but that is not what you are paying Spotify for.
[21:53:57] <manicennui> And you obviously don't want to pay for files.
[21:54:09] <Brekkjern> manicennui: exactly why I am trying to find an alternative that doesn't suck ass
[21:54:30] <manicennui> It isn't about some hipster desire to have old things.
[21:54:39] <gwozniak> I don't stream music, but I do keep it all in digital form
[21:54:57] <manicennui> I like the physical objects, and CD inserts are often pretty cool, as well as the disc itself.
[21:55:14] <gwozniak> Yeah, I like the inserts too
[21:55:15] <manicennui> And CD audio is a format that had no restrictions.
[21:55:26] <manicennui> I can buy imported CDs and play them without any concerns.
[21:55:39] <gwozniak> Digital music is actually worse for metadata than physical, too
[21:55:59] <manicennui> CDs are the right mix of convenience and the other things I want.
[21:56:24] <manicennui> My main issue with vinyl is that each side of a record is so short, especially for the higher quality pressings.
[21:56:28] <Brekkjern> gwozniak: metadata is a universal problem with digital files :/
[21:56:35] <gwozniak> I have too many books to hold CD cases :/
[21:56:59] <manicennui> I have a CD changer that I can load up with hours of music.
[21:57:41] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: I suspect it's that the producers of such things are just plain lazy.  There's no reason the metadata on a track I buy from the source on Bandcamp, for example, can't contain all the relevant info for it
[21:57:58] <Brekkjern> True
[21:58:01] <manicennui> Including the ability to continue playing a CD while changing most of them!
[21:58:05] <manicennui> Super futuristic!
[21:58:22] <gwozniak> Year 2000 stuff right there
[21:58:34] <manicennui> heh
[21:58:55] <manicennui> Remember the 50 disc changers?
[21:59:00] <gwozniak> Oh yeah
[21:59:24] <ngoldbaum> a disc changer taking up a ton of room in your trunk
[21:59:30] <manicennui> Sweet!
[21:59:33] <manicennui> I forgot about those!
[21:59:53] <manicennui> Also, a discman with cassette adapter for old cars!
[22:00:38] <manicennui> I actually do hate that all of the auto makers are moving to LCD controls that include the stereo.
[22:00:43] <ngoldbaum> my friends were all blown away how you could store so many gb of music on an ipod when i first got one, the ipod was just *so* much smaller than the other hard drive mp3 playwrs
[22:00:47] <manicennui> I want to be able to replace the factory stereo.
[22:00:58] <manicennui> iPods were truly great devices.
[22:01:08] <gwozniak> Yeah
[22:01:27] <manicennui> I found my old iPod when I moved and charged it and it still worked.
[22:01:35] <ngoldbaum> no one gives a shit about decent hifi anymore, most songs aren’t mixed in a way where caring about keeping noise low when the gain is turned up anyway
[22:02:12] <manicennui> No one cares about good music anymore.
[22:02:16] <gwozniak> There's so little dynamic range in popular music it almost doesn't matter if you have a decent sound system
[22:02:17] * manicennui shakes his cane in the air
[22:02:42] <manicennui> Look at poor dimadima listening to Sublime
[22:02:58] <ngoldbaum> songs are mixed to sound ok in ipod earbuds, which are very shitty
[22:03:29] <dimadima> woahhhh amber is the color of your energy woooooaahhhh
[22:03:44] <gwozniak> I used my good headphones to listen to stuff through my ThinkPad the other day and it was amazing how bad it sounded
[22:03:45] <manicennui> dimadima: You could at least listen to Alice in Chains or something.
[22:03:53] <dimadima> switching it up right there with some 311
[22:04:06] <dimadima> i'm more of a stone temple pilots guy
[22:04:14] <manicennui> There you go.
[22:04:23] <manicennui> I haven't listened to STP in forever.
[22:04:27] * gwozniak is currently listening to some big band jazz through his soundbar setup in his office
[22:05:05] <dimadima> what's the big band jazz
[22:05:08] <dimadima> are you streaming it
[22:05:31] <gwozniak> No. I bought it and listen to it from my local machine
[22:05:56] <gwozniak> Although the soundbar setup does, unfortunately, use a Bluetooth subwoofer
[22:06:39] <gwozniak> The band is Resolution 88, to answer the other question
[22:06:45] <dimadima> yes thank you
[22:07:16] <gwozniak> Well, it's sort of big band-ish.  More ensemble jazz
[22:07:21] <dimadima> my computer doesn't have a CD player
[22:07:27] <dimadima> you hate bluetooth stuff too?
[22:07:32] <dimadima> why it does all sound like shit
[22:07:52] <gwozniak> I have to reset the woofer all the time because it just... stops working
[22:08:00] <ngoldbaum> laptops have always had shit audio
[22:08:00] <dimadima> maybe "like shit" is a bit much
[22:08:18] <gwozniak> But because of the layout of my office, it is kind of what I needed
[22:08:31] <ngoldbaum> you can hear noise correlated with disk i/o because the audio is getting interference from the PCI bus
[22:08:35] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: true, but my work MBPro sounds a whole helluva lot better
[22:08:54] <ngoldbaum> yeah apple is better about designing the audio not to be shit
[22:09:03] <ngoldbaum> not so much other manufacturers
[22:09:12] <ngoldbaum> PC mobo onboard audio also has this issue
[22:09:31] <ngoldbaum> you need a sound card if you want audio that’s not going to get interference from the rest of the system
[22:11:05] <indigo> My desktop's mobo audio isn't that bad, thankfully
[22:11:16] <manicennui> indigo: Is it a GAMING MOBO?
[22:11:38] <dimadima> i haven't heard anything about sound quality out of computers in decades
[22:11:40] <indigo> Nope :) Just your regular ol' ASRock B450M/ac
[22:11:43] <gwozniak> My desktop's audio, when I can get it to come out of the headphone jack (yay Linux audio) is decent
[22:11:45] <dimadima> like since 1998 probably
[22:11:58] <manicennui> SOUNDBLASTER
[22:12:02] <dimadima> exactly.
[22:12:20] <dimadima> although i still mostly try to use monster cables
[22:12:26] <gwozniak> indigo: ha! I have the same mobo
[22:12:32] <dimadima> awesome
[22:12:35] <indigo> It's a good mobo. Not flashy
[22:12:36] <dimadima> mobo budies
[22:12:41] <dimadima> buddies
[22:12:44] <indigo> It could do with a better preamp for the mic input but otherwise it's nice
[22:12:50] <gwozniak> Yeah, it is nice
[22:13:09] <indigo> It's actually a Microcenter prebuilt :P the only way I could get a graphics card for a decent price
[22:13:15] <manicennui> I have a ASROCK Z97 EXTREME6
[22:13:29] <gwozniak> I'm hoping I don't need to replace it for many years
[22:13:45] <dimadima> this is the chat i come here for
[22:13:54] <manicennui> Bought it in 2014 with a 4790k.
[22:13:58] <manicennui> Still very good.
[22:14:04] <indigo> Depends on when you'll need PCIe 4
[22:14:07] <gwozniak> I got it because it has SPDIF output. One of the few that size that still have it
[22:14:19] <Brekkjern> Isn't SPDIF rather low bandwidth?
[22:14:51] <bkero> dont most high end boards have spdif?
[22:14:56] <gwozniak> Maybe...?
[22:15:04] <bkero> both of mine did
[22:15:18] <bkero> z370 and z570
[22:15:24] <gwozniak> I dunno, but SPDIF is the most convenient way to connect to my sound system
[22:15:25] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[22:16:24] <manicennui> "The most common SPDIF data rates are 44.1khz for stereo CD audio and 48khz for digital audio tape (DAT)."
[22:16:40] <ngoldbaum> which is fine
[22:16:51] <ngoldbaum> and won’t have electrical interference in the audio signal
[22:17:05] <Brekkjern> Well, nothing from the source system at least :P
[22:17:17] <indigo> I can just imagine gwozniak cranking up "Ride of the Valkyries" before opening up his work bug tracker :P
[22:17:21] <bkero> ngoldbaum: thats assuming optical
[22:17:52] <ngoldbaum> i had a fun time at an old house when i realized the unshielded audio cables going to my cheapo speakers were picking up AM radio because of how they were oriented
[22:17:57] <gwozniak> indigo: pretty sure that's in my collection :)
[22:18:04] <indigo> Heheh
[22:19:08] <Brekkjern> One variety of iPhones leaked RF so bad that you could pick up the sound from the speakers about 20 meters away with a regular AM radio
[22:19:44] <bkero> yeesh

[22:19:54] <buttsbot> Listening To An IPhone With AM Radio | Hackaday
[22:20:36] <epilys> my pc cases' sound inputs pick up signals from the usb port right next to it, so if you transfer data through a usb stick or to a phone you can hear the traffic in the loudspeakers.
[22:21:00] <manicennui> My condo has built-in rear speakers in the ceiling. I've never used them though.
[22:21:06] <manicennui> They are probably good enough for rear speakers.
[22:21:17] <manicennui> Can't imagine that my upstairs neighbor would appreciate them.
[22:21:31] <manicennui> Really stupid that they put speakers in the ceiling but didn't do anything to reduce noise between units.
[22:22:13] <Brekkjern> The only reason I want a house rather than a flat is to get some proper speaker systems on my home cinema system :P
[22:22:23] <manicennui> Brekkjern: That is one of many reasons.
[22:22:31] <manicennui> Although I'm more concerned about music than movies.
[22:22:50] <manicennui> Just want to buy a set of high end front speakers.
[22:23:13] <manicennui> Sit in a recliner and listen to music while enjoying a cocktail.
[22:23:39] <Brekkjern> Hehe
[22:24:28] <manicennui> I have bookshelf speakers now, and I try not to turn the stereo up too loud.
[22:24:41] <manicennui> And I try not to have it one after maybe 10PM on a weeknight.
[22:24:47] <manicennui> Maybe midnight on the weekend.
[22:25:23] <Brekkjern> I can pretty much fill my apartment with music without the neighbours hearing much. The walls, floor and ceiling of my unit are all made of thick concrete.
[22:25:36] <manicennui> Who burned out better: Scott Weiland or Layne Staley?
[22:25:50] <Brekkjern> So unless I run my sub hard, it doesn't bother others
[22:26:01] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Yeah, I don't know about your country, but someone showed me how buildings are built in Germany, and it is pretty impressive.
[22:26:07] <manicennui> In the US we build garbage.
[22:26:40] <Brekkjern> manicennui: Yeah. US building quality is one of the things that made me do a double take. I've seen better construction in Russia...
[22:26:52] <manicennui> And my building is one of many 100-year-old buildings in Chicago where some mediocre contractor gut rehabbed the interior without improving the structure.
[22:27:18] <manicennui> In fact they fucked up the water proofing on the roof and damaged the brick walls.
[22:27:39] <ngoldbaum> i live in a newish (2018) townhome and am pretty happy with it
[22:27:52] <ngoldbaum> first time i’ve lived somewhere that doesn’t leak air like a sieve
[22:28:08] <manicennui> Can you hear your neighbors at all?
[22:28:19] <manicennui> Assuming you are both inside.
[22:28:35] <ngoldbaum> no not through the walls there’s proper sound isolation
[22:28:40] <manicennui> dimadima: I'm listening to Purple.
[22:28:41] <Brekkjern> I can hear the neighbours above sometimes. Only when they have the TV on real loud or something like that
[22:29:07] <ngoldbaum> standing right outside the closed porch door next to my living room i can’t hear the TV
[22:29:35] <manicennui> I didn't realize that the bassist and guitarist wrote most of STP's songs.
[22:29:36] <ngoldbaum> there’s definitely some cheapy choices but also it’s a rental
[22:29:39] <manicennui> I didn't even know their names.
[22:29:58] <manicennui> And they are brothers.
[22:30:10] <manicennui> ngoldbaum: Solid.
[22:31:17] <manicennui> I have a friend who bought a house in Chicago and renovated it himself. He did a test where he turned up his stereo very loud and went outside and couldn't hear it.
[22:31:36] <manicennui> It's on a small lot.
[22:31:58] <manicennui> It has an entire second kitchen in the basement.
[22:32:03] <ngoldbaum> my heating bill here is like a third of the old house at like 2/3 the square footage
[22:32:24] <ngoldbaum> but also i could see daylight through the closed front door at that house…
[22:36:09] <manicennui> The Chicago cops suck so much that multiple neighborhoods are now discussing hiring private security.
[22:37:06] <manicennui> Lightfoot is not happy that they are doing it, but has done nothing about the spike in crime during the pandemic.
[22:37:23] <manicennui> We did increase the police budget though!
[22:40:05] <gwozniak> Gotta buy some more weapons, I'm sure
[22:40:39] <manicennui> I think most of it goes to more overtime for them to sit in their cars and do nothing.
[22:40:58] <gwozniak> And probably that
[22:41:21] <manicennui> Everyone in the city knows that you don't bother calling the cops about anything other than like an active shooter situation or finding a dead body.
[22:41:44] <manicennui> Even calling them after the fact if there was a shooting is pretty useless if no one was killed.
[22:41:55] <manicennui> Not that they solve homicides.
[22:42:49] <manicennui> They won't even show up in a lot of situations where you just need a police report for insurance purposes.
[22:43:19] <dimadima> i had some friends who got robbed at gunpoint and CPD tried to make them testify against someone else
[22:43:20] <manicennui> Their attitude seems to be that if they do something wrong, and you talk about it, they'll just do even less.
[22:43:33] <dimadima> they told them it didn't matter cause that person was "also a bad guy"
[22:43:50] <manicennui> I don't think they patrol the CTA anymore because they murdered someone for jumping the turnstile.
[22:44:46] <manicennui> It's not clear to me whether their black site ever got shut down.

[22:45:06] <manicennui> Seems we paid millions in reparations to people who were tortured years ago.
[22:46:20] <manicennui> Richard Dvorak, a longtime criminal defense attorney also said he was unaware of any issues unique to Homan Square; he stated, "Everything that was described (in the Guardian story) was something that happens every day. I think it's pretty systemic throughout CPD."
[22:46:23] <manicennui> Oh, okay then.
[22:46:45] <manicennui> As long as we just systematically disappear people without access to an attorney until they beat a confession out of them I guess it is fine.
[22:48:15] <manicennui> Nothing will change until tourists or rich property developers are affected.

[23:23:40] <manicennui> Is there a lock like that that doesn't cost an order of magnitude more that would take minutes to open?
[23:23:48] <manicennui> Or is it like 1 second verses 10?
[23:24:03] <Brekkjern> It's not reasonable to assume any lock by Master Lock to be secure, no.
[23:24:40] <manicennui> Brekkjern: How long does it take to open a "good" lock of that size and general style?
[23:24:53] <Brekkjern> Thing is, you can have a decent padlock, but they can only be as secure as the thing they lock into.
[23:25:21] <manicennui> Assuming keyed, not combo.
[23:25:24] <Brekkjern> And there isn't really a benchmark for "how long" as it depends a lot on the complexity of a lock
[23:25:50] <manicennui> Brekkjern: I'm just wondering whether a "good" lock is actually much better.
[23:25:51] <Brekkjern> A regular pin and tumbler lock can be raked if it doesn't have security pins.
[23:25:53] <manicennui> For that application.
[23:26:04] <Brekkjern> Which is what that guy did in the video
[23:27:07] <Brekkjern> I don't have any padlocks so I don't really have any suggestions about what to get, but a lock with serrated pins and security pins will be much harder to rake, so you will have to pick it manually
[23:27:26] <Brekkjern> Depending on skill, that can mean 30-45 seconds, or minutes
[23:27:50] <Brekkjern> Or you shove a crowbar into the lock and break it, making it take seconds again :P
[23:28:34] <indigo> I heard Medeco locks are especially pick-resistant
[23:28:53] <Brekkjern> I can recommend having a look at a few videos by Lockpicking Lawyer on YT. Entertaining and he often shows the various ways you can get past a lock
[23:28:59] <Brekkjern> Including picking them
[23:30:20] <manicennui> Can't convince a Rails lover to not add more convenience methods.
[23:30:39] <manicennui> I really need to never work with Rails again.
[23:31:11] <manicennui> If you have a small app, having associations for everything is probably fine, but we probably have 100+ associated classes for Customer.
[23:31:47] <manicennui> Trying to convince them to just treat most classes as their own bounded context, and do Foo.find_for_customer_id instead of customer.foos.
[23:33:56] <gwozniak> So, this person wants to do all the work in the Customers class just because a Customer is involved in some way?
[23:34:13] <manicennui> gwozniak: Not exactly.
[23:34:29] <manicennui> In Rails you have associations, which are just convenience methods for handling foreign keys.
[23:34:46] <manicennui> So you add a line of code to the class to associate it with the other.
[23:35:01] <manicennui> Then you can do customers.foos and foo.customer
[23:35:25] <manicennui> Which is nice, but when you have a huge monolith, you have to consider whether it makes sense to have dozens or 100+ of these.
[23:35:39] <manicennui> Plus, you are basically expanding the API for your Customer class to everything in the damn system.
[23:35:56] <manicennui> Pass a customer object into some method, and now it has access to everything associated with it directly.
[23:36:08] <manicennui> And all of your code becomes highly coupled.
[23:36:51] <manicennui> I prefer finders on the other class because it makes it more explicit, plus that thing might be pulled out into another service or something, and the API remains mostly the same.
[23:37:20] <manicennui> It's really hard to get people to think about these things when everything is in one repo.
[23:38:09] <manicennui> Our Customer class currently has 70 associations.
[23:38:13] <gwozniak> I was wondering why some C file in this benchmark suite I'm working with was taking so long to compile.  Then I looked at the file.  All 128MGs of it.
[23:38:23] <river> lol
[23:38:28] <river> you have the most interesting work gwozniak
[23:39:43] <manicennui> And many of those associations have one or more scopes, which are just different conditions on the association so you can quickly access specific sets of Foos for that customer.
[23:40:24] <manicennui> To make it more concrete, you might have a Customer class with a loans association, and a paid_off scope.
[23:41:16] <gwozniak> oh, okay. I think I get the idea
[23:43:32] <manicennui> All of this is nice, but when your app is huge, you have to consider whether it makes sense to use all of this convenience.
[23:44:19] <manicennui> Our Customer class with all includes is well over 10k lines.
[23:44:28] <manicennui> And this is Ruby, so a line of code can do a lot.
[23:44:44] <manicennui> Ruby with ActiveSupport (Rails), which makes it even denser.
[23:48:31] <gwozniak> Yeah, when things scale up, those convenience things can turn into an obfuscating encumbrance
[23:48:34] <manicennui> I was a believer in the "majestic monolith" for a while, but now I realize that most people can't follow good practices unless code is in separate repos.
[23:49:11] <manicennui> gwozniak: Over time I've actually grown to dislike associations entirely due to what they mean for the API for a class.
[23:49:14] <gwozniak> Use multiple repos.  Not too many.  Mostly large-ish.
[23:49:31] <manicennui> It might seem nice to be able to do customer.orders, but anything you pass customer into can now access orders directly too.
[23:49:58] <manicennui> That thing could obviously do Orders.find_by_customer_id or whatever, but I think that is much better and explicit.
[23:50:11] <manicennui> And the coupling between that method and Customer is not increased.
[23:50:28] <manicennui> Yeah, multiple services has its own set of challenges.
[23:50:29] <river> https://i.redd.it/mce3gnhktx581.jpg here are some locks that are hard to pick :> more expensive that normal locks
[23:51:02] <manicennui> river: Like an order of magnitude more?
[23:51:05] <river> yes
[23:51:06] <ngoldbaum> lock picking lawyer joins the chat
[23:51:20] <river> those are some black belt level locks

[23:52:04] <buttsbot> Twitter - jasonschreier - Omicron presents a tremendous challenge: do you go out and risk getting covid or stay on the internet and risk hearing people talk about NFTs
[23:52:21] <manicennui> gwozniak: I'd argue that certain things are fine to associate in a large Rails app, like customer and address.
[23:52:33] <manicennui> But loans is a completely different area.
[23:52:42] <river> haha
[23:53:14] <manicennui> Almost everything in our system is associated in one way or another with customers or loans, but that doesn't mean that those two classes must contain code for everything.
[23:53:26] <gwozniak> manicennui: we have multiple repos and it's actually a pain.  I would like to have everything in one.
[23:53:54] <manicennui> gwozniak: Multiple repos that result in your compiler?
[23:53:56] <gwozniak> But that's because we actually need all of them in order to build everything
[23:53:59] <manicennui> Or different tools that you build?
[23:54:29] <gwozniak> Yeah.  All the toolchain is in one place, but libraries, tests and documentation and other little things are scattered all over the place
[23:54:36] <manicennui> In the case of web development, the multiple repos are generally multiple services that run independently, but might call each other.
[23:54:40] <manicennui> Ah.
[23:54:59] <manicennui> Yeah, I think code, tests, and documentation should be in one repo for one service/tool.
[23:55:06] <gwozniak> I think if we had about 5 repos it would be okay.  But we have something like 15.
[23:55:14] <manicennui> But I can see libraries being in their own repo, despite the pain it sometimes introduces.
[23:55:47] <manicennui> Did you read about Google having one copy of any library in their entire org?
[23:55:52] *** Quits: sayjay (sid349011@id-349011.uxbridge.irccloud.com) ()
[23:56:04] <gwozniak> The thing is that our code is based on GCC and friends, so we can't really change that very easily
[23:56:07] <manicennui> Apparently upgrading log4j required updating it in one place, then the system determines what needs to be rebuilt.
[23:56:31] <manicennui> They also vendor libraries.
[23:59:31] <gwozniak> There are other historical reasons for all these repos we have, which also span different version control systems
