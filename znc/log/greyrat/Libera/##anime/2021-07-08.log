[02:01:23] <Sxem> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-8-Tetrahydrocannabinol
[02:01:23] <ImoutoBot> [title] delta-8-Tetrahydrocannabinol - Wikipedia
[02:01:44] <Sxem> Delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-8-THC, Δ8-THC) is a psychoactive cannabinoid found in the Cannabis plant.[1][2][3] It is an isomer of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC
[02:02:06] <Sxem> In chemistry, isomers are molecules or polyatomic ions with identical molecular formulas — that is, same number of atoms of each element — but distinct arrangements of atoms in space.
[02:02:25] <Sxem> so Roey was way off about delta 8 thc
[02:02:51] <Sxem> its a milder version of thc
[02:02:58] <Sxem> and you can grow as much as you want
[02:03:12] <Sxem> tons of ppl smoke it all the time
[02:04:24] *** Quits: ntdll (~ntdll@user/ntdll) (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
[02:04:24] <Sxem> its more often legal than delta 9 thc, bcs its thc-lite
[02:04:51] <Sxem>  <Roey> <Sxem> you shd try delta 8 thc if you dont react well to delta 9 <- that stuff is just flower sprayed with delta-9 oil; there's no natural plant that produces enough d8 thc to get high off of it
[02:04:59] <Sxem> there is no spraying of delta 9 oil
[02:06:03] <Sxem> As of early 2021, "Delta-8"/∆8-THC is one of the fastest growing segments of products derived from hemp
[02:06:12] <Sxem> they are mass producing more delta 8 thc than ever before
[02:07:39] <Sxem> im very sensitive to delta 9 thc. just one puff lasts me 5-6 hours
[02:07:50] <Sxem> so delta 8 thc might be perfect for me
[02:11:24] <Sxem> Delta-8-THC grows in small amounts on cannabis plants naturally, but commercial extractors are using selective breeding and molecular isolation to extract concentrates that are abundant in Delta-8-THC and other rare cannabinoids.
[02:11:51] <Roey> Sxem: yeah, delta-8 I mean
[02:11:56] <Roey> sprayed with delta-8 oil.
[02:12:10] <Roey> because delta-8 does not occur naturally in high enough concentrations in any flower otherwise
[02:12:31] <Sxem> oh, i see. i was just googling it
[02:12:54] <Roey> Sxem: in other words, they grow hemp, then extract the oil from it, extract that delta8 from that, concentrate it into an oil
[02:12:55] <Sxem> i thought you cd grow delta 8 plants
[02:12:57] <Roey> then spray it on the flower.
[02:13:00] <Roey> Sxem: nope
[02:13:36] <Sxem> no point in smoking delta 8 then, may as well get edibles
[02:13:51] <Sxem> more efficient, no need to turn my lungs black
[02:13:52] <Roey> yeah.
[02:13:59] <Roey> I mean, it's so artificial, the whole thing.
[02:14:00] <Roey> ugh
[02:14:02] <Sxem> can you smoke the oil directly?
[02:14:14] <Roey> yeah, you can get cartridges
[02:14:21] <Sxem> i see they have delta 8 vaporizers
[02:14:24] <Roey> of d8 oil, just like you can of d9 oil.
[02:14:27] <Sxem> i guess you put the oil in there
[02:14:32] <Roey> probably so
[02:14:39] <Sxem> cool
[02:15:01] <Roey> just remember: 
[02:15:02] <Roey> it's all marketing.
[02:15:09] <Sxem> it says it has less mental effects, but also gives more energy physically
[02:15:46] <Sxem> we're finding out that Delta-8 is a better daytime cannabinoid and maybe Delta-9 is more for nighttime
[02:16:51] <Roey> you know what I think is better than any of that for energy?
[02:16:52] <sentionics> you have 2 choices: a) Senti is drunk. b) senti is as sober as a whistle
[02:16:53] <Roey> (not doing it)
[02:16:55] <Sxem> delta 8 less of a sedative
[02:17:06] <Roey> I propose taking a break
[02:17:10] <Roey> from it altogether.
[02:17:17] <sentionics> I wish I could
[02:17:24] <Sxem> i am guessing a) Senti is drunk. 
[02:17:39] <sentionics> Sxem is today's winner.
[02:17:50] <Sxem> senti is always drunk, even when unemployed. he is a magical leprechaun sitting on a pot of gold so he can buy alcohol forever

[03:16:33] <Sxem> my lawyer ex-gf is planning to go to ireland by the end of the year
[03:16:53] <Sxem> she is a divorce lawyer, so she benefitted a lot from covid
[03:17:09] <Sxem> the lockdown ended a lot of marriages
[03:17:11] <Roey> oh interesting
[03:17:31] <Sxem> that wdve lasted a long time if they were able to spend 2-3 hours together per day instead of 24 hours per day
[03:18:04] <senti_> Sxem: imagine if you had to deal with my drunk ass during lockdown 
[03:18:15] <senti_> that's why marriages... fail
[03:18:19] <Sxem> i think telepathy wd also ruin most marriages, once you found out what yr spouse really thinks of you
[03:18:50] <senti_> I like butts. you think a woman would knock me for thinking about her butt a lot?
[03:19:15] <Sxem> she might find out you think of her as a butt, and some skin surrounding a butt

[10:12:44] <MootPoot> I like both onee-sans and lolis
[10:12:56] <ButterNoodle> get ready for the ole in-out-in-out
[10:13:13] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: my guess is that there's less of a difference with room temp for what you perceive as cold than what you perceive as hot
[10:13:30] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I'm that way with coffee, hot coffee stops being hot way faster than iced coffee gets too warm
[10:13:33] <MootPoot> its not about what I percieve 
[10:13:39] <TsundereNoises> and some of it is the range of temps that count
[10:13:40] <MootPoot> its the labels on the flasks
[10:13:43] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises speaks the tru tru
[10:13:53] <MootPoot> they always say it keeps stuff cold much longer
[10:14:00] <ButterNoodle> right
[10:14:06] <TsundereNoises> yeah and how does that not apply to what I said?
[10:14:11] <ButterNoodle> cold = somewhere above freezing
[10:14:20] <MootPoot> like my bubba flask says 42h cold but 12h hot
[10:14:21] <TsundereNoises> if something is 20 degrees above room temp, it isn't hot
[10:14:25] <ButterNoodle> hot = somewhere above 150F
[10:14:30] <TsundereNoises> if something is 20 degrees below it seems colder
[10:14:38] <MootPoot> you said percieve
[10:14:40] <ButterNoodle> if room temp is 70
[10:14:49] <MootPoot> I dont know feet units
[10:15:03] <ButterNoodle> 40F to 70F > 70F to 150F
[10:15:04] <ButterNoodle> ok
[10:15:06] <ButterNoodle> i convert
[10:15:17] <MootPoot> lol
[10:15:35] <MootPoot> wait
[10:15:38] <TsundereNoises> anyway, I agree with this but ima let ButterNoodle do the math
[10:15:44] <MootPoot> but why would it be percieved though?
[10:15:53] <MootPoot> like say room temp is 20C
[10:15:54] <ButterNoodle> 6C to 20C < 20C to 50C
[10:15:55] <TsundereNoises> I meant in terms of what you mean by hot
[10:16:07] <ButterNoodle> that should have been a < on the first one
[10:16:10] <MootPoot> by hot I just mean "higher then room temp"
[10:16:15] <MootPoot> and cold I mean "cooler then room temp"
[10:16:18] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I'm saying even if the temperature changes evenly, what you mean when you want a hot or cold drink is a different range
[10:16:20] <ButterNoodle> 20c is about room temp
[10:16:24] <ButterNoodle> !c 20c to F
[10:16:25] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: 20 Celsius = 68 Fahrenheit
[10:16:42] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I doubt you mean that, or at least none of the rest of us including people that label beverage containers mean that
[10:16:42] <ButterNoodle> :|
[10:16:46] <ButterNoodle> !t 50C to F
[10:16:47] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: I don't know.
[10:16:54] <ButterNoodle> !t 50c to F
[10:16:54] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: I don't know.
[10:17:01] <ButterNoodle> !c 50c to F
[10:17:02] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: 50 Celsius = 122 Fahrenheit
[10:17:07] <MootPoot> well thats what I would THINK they mean when the label the containers
[10:17:11] <ButterNoodle> yea its more like 65 then
[10:17:19] <MootPoot> but in personal human terms I would go with what you said 
[10:17:21] <amigojapan> 0@⁰ TsundereNoises tomako broke her promise and I won't be reading curry today
[10:17:24] <ButterNoodle> its ur silly human brain MootPoot 
[10:17:36] <amigojapan> Eating curry
[10:17:37] <ButterNoodle> eat it instead amigojapan 
[10:17:43] <ButterNoodle> oh
[10:17:44] <ButterNoodle> bummber
[10:17:46] <amigojapan> Lol ButterNoodle 
[10:17:49] <MootPoot> but in a 200iq science brain all you would really care about is how long it takes for the liquid to get back to room temp right?
[10:18:04] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: a 7 C drink is cold, a 28 C drink is not hot
[10:18:20] <ButterNoodle> absolute values MootPoot 
[10:18:24] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I'm sorry to hear that,
[10:18:34] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I was hoping you'd get curried away with eating too much curry
[10:18:50] <amigojapan> Thanks for understanding the longing of my stomach TsundereNoises 
[10:18:51] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: 
[10:18:59] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: they label these things so as to not get angry customers
[10:19:04] <ButterNoodle> read that doujin
[10:19:09] <Nanobot> TsundereNoises: Your joke didn't really bother me. I didn't even think it was intentional at first.
[10:19:14] <MootPoot> which doujin
[10:19:17] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: you don't call something hot if it's just a bit above room temp
[10:19:23] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I was only going to eat one serving anyway
[10:19:31] <MootPoot> hmm
[10:19:44] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot:  "hop, step, hi, kick" 
[10:19:48] <MootPoot> so you're saying in reality both the numbers should be the same, its just due to how to humans percieve temperature
[10:19:53] <ButterNoodle> fucking brutal and short
[10:20:00] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: okay, I was worried for a minute, people have that "too soon" reaction sometimes and sometimes I want to fight it but in this case Kyoani was a legit tragedy and I worried maybe I crossed a line
[10:20:01] <MootPoot> nhentai?
[10:20:05] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: but yeah, it was intentional
[10:20:07] <ButterNoodle> maybe?
[10:20:11] <ButterNoodle> exhentai
[10:20:29] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: yes, that's what I think is the case
[10:20:45] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: i have this issue with my coffee every day
[10:21:03] <MootPoot> good to hear you drink coffee and not tea like a degenerate

[10:26:27] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  order what
[10:26:47] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: does she just not like Indian?

[10:27:11] <MootPoot> nah
[10:27:14] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: she does not eat it
[10:27:17] <MootPoot> just normally, or through a bouncer
[10:27:17] <TsundereNoises> Berlin36: I mean, I don't know if you've come here before, but far too often people come in, say "yo" or something, then leave in 1 minute if no one says anything
[10:27:26] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  tell her to stop being picky
[10:27:48] <MootPoot> Berlin36:  like 90% of our new users do that tbh, come in "hi" we say hi back, then they leave forever
[10:27:51] <TsundereNoises> Berlin36: not accusing you or anything, just it's frustratingly common, and many of us are often doing other things, and so may not respond as fast
[10:28:02] <TsundereNoises> Berlin36: or at all if there have been a lot of those recently
[10:28:04] <Berlin36> 3,99TsundereNoises99,99 yes, that may be true because i believe people try to find some channels that are alive
[10:28:53] <MootPoot> Berlin36:  if you want quick responses in this channel try some of these phrases "madoka magica is a bad show" or "windows is the best OS" or  "Online privacy is not a big deal" , or "FOSS is a bad idea"

[10:30:41] <Berlin36> Lmao good
[10:30:46] <MootPoot> we have a few regular users who straight up avoid anime
[10:31:13] <TsundereNoises> and a few of us who love anime but just haven't managed to watch any in a couple months

[12:59:02] <amigojapan> Lol
[12:59:34] <Berlin36> k im bacc
[12:59:41] <death916> sory that wasnt 10 mins
[12:59:44] <death916> u gotta leave for another 5
[12:59:45] <DunceCotus> amigojapan there was a point in history where they added a thousand years to the calendar
[12:59:47] <Berlin36> :(
[12:59:49] <death916> jk
[12:59:51] <Berlin36> okay bb
[13:00:00] <Berlin36> see ya in 7
[13:00:27] <death916> not in between jesus time and now i dont think DunceCotus
[13:00:30] <death916> they jsu changed dating
[13:00:31] <DunceCotus> like dates used to be written like "i530" for some reason (forgot why)
[13:00:31] <DunceCotus> then the i was distorted into a 1
[13:00:44] <DunceCotus> not necessarily a conspiracy but a strange unconscious distortion
[13:00:59] <death916> romans werent around 1 thoudand yrs ago
[13:01:08] <DunceCotus> death916 actually they were
[13:01:14] <death916> as byzantines
[13:01:16] <death916> or something
[13:01:17] <death916> hre
[13:01:20] <DunceCotus> greco-roman society was around in middle ages
[13:01:23] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I is 1 in Roman letters
[13:01:29] <DunceCotus> so was "ancient egypt"
[13:01:43] <death916> im saying 1 thousand is too short
[13:01:59] <death916> mayb not numbers r hard
[13:01:59] <DunceCotus> amigojapan yeah but this was also not julian calendar
[13:02:05] <death916> doesnt matetr what calander
[13:02:07] <death916> a yr is a yr
[13:02:20] <death916> it was 365 days more than 1000xs
[13:02:20] <DunceCotus> look im just telling you hard facts
[13:02:37] <DunceCotus> there's no need to get upset
[13:02:38] <death916> a yr is how long the earth moves around the sun that has happened more times than 1000
[13:02:41] <death916> lol
[13:03:10] <DunceCotus> death916 our historical record has been distorted massively
[13:03:24] <amigojapan> death916: DunceCotus had an extremely strange world view
[13:03:30] <death916> its not strange its wrong
[13:03:31] <death916> lol
[13:03:34] <DunceCotus> basically there's growing evidence that ancient greece, rome, egypt etc. existed at least in early middle ages
[13:04:14] <death916> egypt did
[13:04:18] <death916> greece is older
[13:04:23] <DunceCotus> and that's why you see parallels between the supposedly ancient greek gear work and that found in middle ages

[13:05:02] <death916> bro thats not how dating works they can carbon date the sites and if not they do soil layers and they have written histories
[13:05:09] <amigojapan> Famous song Berlin36 
[13:05:13] <Berlin36> yee
[13:05:37] <DunceCotus> what we consider 500BC - 0AD = more likely early middle ages
[13:05:59] <death916> its just a termwhat matters is how many years before nwo it was
[13:06:05] <death916> the label doesnt matter
[13:06:06] <DunceCotus> carbon dating can be misleading
[13:06:13] <death916> true
[13:06:22] <amigojapan> death916: this would not be the only thing he was wrong at. In fact he rather be wrong
[13:06:24] <death916> which is why i said written histories and actual geology
[13:06:31] <death916> in combined with dating
[13:07:01] <DunceCotus> what seems clear is we did not have a 500+ years 'dark ages'
[13:07:13] <DunceCotus> there was no big technological loss
[13:07:16] <death916> i kinda agree wit that
[13:07:24] <death916> well not agree but might believe
[13:07:27] <DunceCotus> its just that greece and rome existed far later than we learn in history books
[13:07:28] <amigojapan> Yeah dark ages are a myth, that is true
[13:07:52] <death916> u cant really argue when rome is destoryed
[13:07:52] <Berlin36> ok im mostly afk, tag me if something happens :O
[13:08:02] <death916> romes destruction was written about by many cultures
[13:08:07] <DunceCotus> you can argue with a lot of it
[13:08:09] <death916> and theres archaeological evidence
[13:08:10] <death916> not rlly
[13:08:22] <death916> how can u argue when 100 ppl in 100 places say rome died on my 4th 2020
[13:08:29] <death916> cuz they were there and went n told every1
[13:08:41] <DunceCotus> the reason the history was distorted was because of what happened after 'ancient' greece/rome/egypt
[13:08:50] <DunceCotus> which was essentially when big world-spanning empires were forming
[13:08:53] <DunceCotus> like Tartaria
[13:09:21] <amigojapan> death916: history is not reliable. We don't even know what's going on right now. How do you expect people to know in the past
[13:09:24] <DunceCotus> 2020?
[13:09:31] <death916> i was jus using a random date
[13:09:35] <death916> to make a point
[13:09:42] <DunceCotus> death916 the problem is who are you asking
[13:09:46] <DunceCotus> what sources are you using etc.
[13:09:52] <death916> the people that were there
[13:09:59] <DunceCotus> we cannot ask people who were there
[13:10:06] <death916> u can read their writings
[13:10:07] <DunceCotus> o.O
[13:10:15] <DunceCotus> and you're sure its their writings?
[13:10:32] <death916> ok so its either a bunch of people lied all  together all over the world
[13:10:40] <Berlin36> guys guys
[13:10:45] <DunceCotus> death916 haven't you heard of secret societies
[13:11:01] <Berlin36> so im learnin OOP in c++, what mini projects should i do for practicing
[13:11:09] <death916> look i agree certain things are wrong or mis represented
[13:11:16] <death916> but some things u cant jus decide are wrong
[13:11:20] <death916> when there sare so many sources
[13:11:28] <amigojapan> Berlin36: guess my number game
[13:11:31] <DunceCotus> so many sources equally distorted
[13:11:33] <Berlin36> hmm
[13:11:39] <Berlin36> i think i did something like that 
[13:11:51] <death916> u can prove these thinga  u can tell when roman building stopped in locations they ruled
[13:11:55] <Berlin36> a random number generates and you should guess it
[13:11:57] <death916> and what sediment layer they are in
[13:11:59] <amigojapan> Berlin36: hangman
[13:12:04] <Berlin36> hangman
[13:12:12] <DunceCotus> death916 right now our geological dating methods are suspect
[13:12:14] <Berlin36> ookay
[13:12:18] <death916> they are broad
[13:12:22] <death916> but clsoe enough
[13:12:24] <DunceCotus> this we must take into account
[13:12:30] <DunceCotus> before saying this layer proves it was X years ago
[13:12:39] <death916> you can say its from x to x years
[13:12:39] <DunceCotus> many factors involved
[13:12:51] <death916> u cant say yes thiss is form 200 bc
[13:12:54] <Berlin36> ye but do i really need to write it in OOP
[13:12:57] <death916> but u can say this is probably from 200 - 450 bc
[13:13:11] <DunceCotus> death916 I think technology is a better dating method
[13:13:23] <amigojapan> Berlin36: use GUI make the game of Life
[13:13:28] <death916> i think multiple dating methods is best
[13:13:33] <death916> and you take the sum
[13:13:34] <Berlin36> oof i never used gui((
[13:13:46] <Berlin36> i don't know how to write gui in c++
[13:13:50] <Berlin36> what do you suggest to learn
[13:13:55] <death916> are you in school
[13:13:58] <DunceCotus> and because the greeks had very sophisticated gear tech that resembles the sophistication of gear tech in middle ages... that implies they are from the same time period
[13:14:00] <death916> why doing c++
[13:14:04] <Berlin36> i mean there are a lot of frameworks an stuff
[13:14:09] <Berlin36> why not doing c++?
[13:14:23] <Berlin36> my school teaches pascal lmao
[13:14:40] <death916> do rust or somethin
[13:14:44] <death916> c__ ahs lot of baggage
[13:14:48] <Berlin36> -_-
[13:14:48] <death916> ffrom legacy
[13:14:53] <death916> ok use go
[13:14:54] <amigojapan> C++is better than C at least
[13:14:57] <death916> or nim
[13:15:03] <death916> or kotlin
[13:15:09] <death916> or asm

[13:15:52] <death916> i dont know how lol jus like super basics
[13:15:53] <Berlin36> i started Golang, but i won't dive too much in a lot of languages now
[13:15:59] <death916> ya i wouldnt
[13:16:00] <Berlin36> i wanna stick to one and learn it well
[13:16:21] <death916> i been doin python for lik3 4 yrs jsu started rust
[13:16:23] <Berlin36> i know the basics of c++
[13:16:30] <Berlin36> yeah python is pretty cool
[13:16:33] <DunceCotus> technology does not exist in a bubble (unless some other universe or sommin)
[13:16:49] <death916> u must love graham hancock hu DunceCotus

[13:16:56] <death916> ya its dope
[13:17:05] <Berlin36> c++ on the other hand...
[13:17:21] <Berlin36> i tried to connect a database to c++ and write to it from a program
[13:17:25] <Berlin36> it was fucking horrible
[13:17:38] <Berlin36> sqlite3
[13:17:41] <death916> i did c++ in highschool
[13:17:43] <death916> i hated it

[13:17:50] <death916> idk why
[13:18:00] <death916> jus felt ucky haha
[13:18:03] <Berlin36> i mean programming languages are mostly just different syntax
[13:18:08] <Berlin36> at least at basic level
[13:18:09] <death916> ya
[13:18:25] <Berlin36> and i like c++ syntax because in some way it's easier to remembers

[13:18:44] <prpldmn> strongly typed languages are nice
[13:18:53] <Berlin36> what is that
[13:18:59] <Berlin36> xD
[13:19:05] <PancakeMatsuri> error checking in Go isn't just syntax
[13:19:52] <Berlin36> i like that Go tells you to go fuck yourself if you don't use something in your code
[13:20:16] <PancakeMatsuri> Go is pretty much telling everyone to go fuck themselves
[13:20:23] <Berlin36> ahshahaha
[13:20:35] <Berlin36> to "go" fuck themselves
[13:20:39] <Berlin36> was this a pun?
[13:20:46] <DunceCotus> it leaks
[13:20:46] <DunceCotus> and I do not think it gets lost
[13:20:46] <DunceCotus> unless there was massive cataclysms in the intervening years that were not recorded
[13:20:46] <DunceCotus> you may lose the ability to build them, but not to store them or use them etc
[13:20:58] <PancakeMatsuri> it wasn't

[13:21:08] <Berlin36> how to write gui in c++
[13:21:24] <Berlin36> i heard about QT
[13:21:38] <DunceCotus> death916 graham hancock im ambivalent about
[13:22:02] <DunceCotus> I think he still relies on mainstream archaeo-geological dating methods
[13:22:19] <DunceCotus> and I'm probably lagging again so apologies for late responses
[13:22:25] <death916> not rllly he says theres ancient civiliaztion with better tech
[13:22:54] <death916> and im pretty sure regular dating doesnt work for most the sites he talks bout
[13:23:00] <DunceCotus> if there was, there was also likely cataclysms not in recorded history
[13:23:07] <death916> thats what he says

[13:26:28] <DunceCotus> I think right after "ancient" greeco-roman society there were global feudal empires, perhaps even collectivist ones rather than monarchist

[13:26:50] <Berlin36> it never fucking works lmao
[13:26:51] <death916> hard to have global empire without global communication
[13:26:56] <death916> they always fragment
[13:26:58] <death916> when thy get big
[13:27:02] <DunceCotus> death916 they had communication
[13:27:10] <DunceCotus> death916 they had electricity 
[13:27:19] <DunceCotus> they got it from the atmosphere
[13:27:26] <DunceCotus> hence all the spires on old buildings
[13:28:20] <DunceCotus> anyway an effective cataclysm occurred which lead to merchant kings gaining power and forming secret societies to manipulate history  
[13:28:26] <DunceCotus> and to confiscate tech
[13:28:50] <death916> where do you get this idea/info
[13:29:07] <DunceCotus> its a bit conspiracist I admit.. 
[13:29:17] <DunceCotus> death916 there was a site called stolenhistory.org
[13:29:26] <DunceCotus> I think it still exists but in a lesser capacity
[13:29:47] <DunceCotus> has a lot of intriguing analyses, but some very unbelievable conclusions sometimes
[13:30:55] <DunceCotus> basically the middle ages was likely pantheistic (as opposed to the commonly thought monotheistic)
[13:31:16] <DunceCotus> and the monotheism was produced out from a cataclysm that fractured the world (perhaps metaphorically and literally)
[13:31:34] <death916> a cataclysm that recent would have evidence
[13:31:49] <DunceCotus> all the worlds religions derive from a common global pantheistic religion
[13:32:04] <DunceCotus> death916 there is some, but yes its scant

[13:32:25] <DunceCotus> death916 there's evidence for 'mud floods' that occurred as late as 1800s
[13:32:29] <Berlin36> welp, im gonna write sum shit now
[13:32:40] <DunceCotus> major cities of the world had to be 'dug out'
[13:33:04] <death916> that shit would b written about
[13:33:12] <prpldmn> late-night conspiracies
[13:33:19] <DunceCotus> and that's perhaps one reason why photos of cities in 1800s have the streets looking like they're covered in dirt
[13:33:23] <death916> all this stuff is too recent to have happened without historical accounts
[13:33:30] <death916> ppl loved writing shit down abck then
[13:33:34] <DunceCotus> or just recently cleaned
[13:33:36] <death916> or drawin pics
[13:33:55] <DunceCotus> death916 yeah but the secret societies got to that
[13:34:06] <death916> my grandpas a mason id know about this
[13:34:21] <DunceCotus> he may not be old enough to know
[13:34:28] <DunceCotus> this would have been mid 1800s
[13:34:56] <death916> they apss down knowledge
[13:34:58] <death916> pass
[13:34:58] <DunceCotus> however as recently as early 1900s they were digging cities out of dirt
[13:35:11] <DunceCotus> death916 repression can be strong
[13:35:22] <DunceCotus> or necessary forgetting
[13:35:49] <DunceCotus> imagine having to remember a golden age prior to a cataclysm, in a post-apocalyptic setting you'd want to forget it

[13:36:24] <death916> u seen Göbekli Tepe its dated to thousands of years b4 people wer supposed to be bale to make monumenta like it
[13:36:49] <DunceCotus> death916 yeah, it was likely not dated correctly
[13:37:01] <DunceCotus> that's the problem really, our dating methods
[13:37:21] <death916> the methods are pretty much proven tho
[13:37:24] <DunceCotus> and how distorted historical records are from prior to even 1950
[13:37:25] <death916> just how they are applied

[13:38:09] <death916> radio carbon is hard to argue with
[13:38:14] <death916> it decays at a certain rate
[13:38:34] <DunceCotus> true enough but that's based on our current understanding of matter
[13:38:35] *** Quits: treeman7 (~treeman5@user/treeman5) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[13:38:39] <death916> its wrong sometimes because samples are contaminted
[13:38:43] <death916> with samples from other eras
[13:38:51] <DunceCotus> and its often not too useful for dating human structures
[13:40:58] <prpldmn> hm
[13:41:01] <death916> its not useful at all rlly fo r that
[13:41:42] <DunceCotus> the megalithic period I think was far more recent than is implied by mainstream archaeology
[13:41:56] <DunceCotus> probably closer to middle ages in timeframe
[13:42:18] <DunceCotus> but before the Quatria/Tartaria global empires
[13:42:55] <swordsmanz> death916:  its not just that its also that diferent conditions can effeect the rate of decay 
[13:43:13] <death916> oh i didn tknow that i thought it was pretty stable
[13:43:36] <swordsmanz> it is pritty stable .. tree rings are p stable too .. but there is stuff that will effect both 
[13:44:23] <DunceCotus> when talking about time we have to be careful about calling anything stable
[13:45:12] <DunceCotus> right down to the composition of matter, or what forms are present
[13:46:15] <swordsmanz> well radio carbon dateing is generalaly considered pritty sound on large object where the errr magin is in the thousands of years

[13:54:47] <death916> it wold b amazing
[13:54:58] <DunceCotus> its not possible to date really
[13:57:32] <swordsmanz> well acurate dateing is possibe

[13:59:41] <DunceCotus> swordsmanz accurate.. how would we ever know if its accurate?
[13:59:50] <DunceCotus> its always gonna be a guess at best
[14:00:12] <death916> u test it on recent things u know the date of
[14:00:14] <death916> and compare
[14:00:32] <death916> or something with a known historical date to use as a baseline
[14:00:35] <DunceCotus> death916 that presupposes space and time is the unchanging

[14:01:00] <death916> so
[14:01:00] <swordsmanz> DunceCotus:  well for the past 1500 - 2100 years or so .. if we use some common sense we  have neuff literary and archilogical records to get things.. pritty much in the right place 
[14:01:26] <DunceCotus> I do not think space-time even 100 years ago was anything like it is now

[14:01:44] <death916> we dcan measure time tho
[14:01:44] <DunceCotus> even apparently immutable facts are not so
[14:01:46] <death916> and space
[14:02:25] <death916> you cnt just say things r wrong because
[14:02:28] <death916> and not have a real reason
[14:02:30] <DunceCotus> you are always measuring them against the present
[14:02:47] <death916> we  measured them 100 yrs ago
[14:02:49] <death916> and they match
[14:03:02] <lastonestanding> penis sizes?
[14:03:10] <death916> ya the greeks were tiny
[14:03:12] <death916> u seen david
[14:03:32] <death916> o w8 that wasnt greek 
[14:03:33] <swordsmanz> i mean special reletivity pritty much dictates that if spacetime chantged over the last 100 years it would be verry hard to mesure without lopoining into quaantom effects 
[14:03:50] <lastonestanding> quantum?
[14:04:10] <lastonestanding> btw why don't we have quantum computing yet?
[14:04:12] <swordsmanz> so like the idea it would effect like what date we put on the fall of troy or something.. would just not change 
[14:04:31] <death916> we do have quantum computing 
[14:04:32] <death916> kinda
[14:04:36] <death916> ibm jus did something
[14:04:37] <swordsmanz> lastonestanding:  wee have had quantom comupting for the lsat 15 years 
[14:04:54] <death916> its ust not consumer level yet
[14:04:54] <lastonestanding> uhm I don't have it
[14:05:01] <lastonestanding> ah okay
[14:05:05] <death916> u didnt havva computer either when they were mainframes
[14:05:06] <swordsmanz> its just not verry sensible to put into a copmsumer product 
[14:05:23] <lastonestanding> is it too powerful for us normal humans?

[14:05:29] <spoonm> swordsmanz: who are you and why are you here?!
[14:05:30] <death916> lastonestanding look up ibms quantum stuff
[14:05:36] <death916> theyve been doing alot of tests lately
[14:05:48] <death916> showing proof of concept
[14:05:56] <death916> and it doing things regular circuits cant
[14:06:08] <swordsmanz> spoonm:  i am known to the old skool amimers 
[14:06:30] <lastonestanding> "IBM’s full quantum stack allows our partners to fully explore their next solutions with a level of fidelity and scale that are unmatched."
[14:06:37] <lastonestanding> isn't that just marketing blabla?
[14:07:17] <swordsmanz> more interstiong that qusntom comuuting tho , is that photonic computers and real wetwarte are going to be comeing out within the next 10 years 
[14:07:39] <death916> no lastonestanding look up their most recent demo
[14:07:45] <death916> hold on i read about it yesterday

[14:08:06] <ImoutoBot> [title] IBM quantum system outpaces classic computer in real-world demo
[14:08:51] <death916> big companies can rent quantum testing time alrdy i think
[14:09:11] <death916> IBM offers cloud access to the most advanced quantum computers available. Learn, develop, and run programs with our quantum applications and systems.
[14:09:17] <death916> i guess u can sign up now
[14:09:17] <Berlin36> yo
[14:09:42] <death916> done jucing?
[14:09:45] <Berlin36> naaaaah
[14:09:47] <lastonestanding> interesting
[14:09:52] <Berlin36> it's confusing
[14:09:54] <Berlin36> and hard
[14:09:56] <swordsmanz> also if yu guys enjoy pontificateing aabout hardware development you can trt #bits-n-chips 
[14:10:08] <lastonestanding> will a quantum computer be able to calculate all prime numbers?
[14:10:09] <Berlin36> i never wanted to do gui stuf
[14:10:33] <Berlin36> but i think it is a usefull skill
[14:10:46] <death916> i hate gui stuff but it is useful vlients want it alot
[14:10:51] <death916> even if its just a checkbox
[14:10:52] <Berlin36> yeahh
[14:11:14] <lastonestanding> gui is done with html stuff
[14:11:15] * amigojapan eats onigiri and sips on cider
[14:11:21] <Berlin36> lol
[14:11:31] <death916> thats why ppl use elctron
[14:11:33] <death916> lol
[14:11:42] <Berlin36> what's that
[14:11:44] <lastonestanding> it's easy and slow
[14:12:11] <death916> jus google it berlin its a framework every app is in now
[14:12:14] <amigojapan> death916: njws is better than electron
[14:12:23] <death916> but most ppl use electron

[14:12:52] <death916> i dont htink electron is unstable i think its jus not efficient
[14:13:10] <swordsmanz> designing a good ui is hard 
[14:13:12] <amigojapan> death916: it easily crashes
[14:13:17] <lastonestanding> efficient how?
[14:13:21] <death916> discord never crasshes
[14:13:27] <Berlin36> swordsmanz yeah it is i guess
[14:13:28] <death916> ram and cpu cycles
[14:13:38] <lastonestanding> amigojapan: does your web browser crash?

[14:14:16] <death916> what if i need tocompile something
[14:14:24] <death916> and electron eating all my ram so its slower
[14:14:36] <lastonestanding> then let your os swap it out
[14:14:45] <lastonestanding> and free some ram this way
[14:15:09] <death916> nothing to swap electron has ram reserved and cmpilation takin the rest guess ill start thrashing my drives
[14:15:13] <Berlin36> i guess it's too early for me to write gui
[14:15:16] <amigojapan> In this case I agree with death916 . I like Qt quick controls 2.0 better

[14:54:44] <Berlin36> some dudes run after a fucking ball
[14:54:49] <Berlin36> WWWWWWWWWWWwOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOO
[14:54:52] <amigojapan> Right
[14:55:15] <amigojapan> Boring as hell
[14:55:26] <Berlin36> yess
[14:55:32] <theholyduck> meh. dont be so salty :P 
[14:55:37] <amigojapan> I think many people must pretend to like it
[14:55:40] <Berlin36> i mean basketball is pretty cool
[14:55:46] <Berlin36> but football is gay
[14:55:48] <Berlin36> lmao
[14:55:49] <Berlin36> sorry
[14:55:53] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  just because you arent into it doesnt mean people who are. arent
[14:56:01] <Berlin36> yeah true
[14:56:05] <theholyduck> amigojapan: im not THAT into soccer in general. i think its not a great TV game 
[14:56:15] <theholyduck> but i will attend major games at my local stadion 
[14:56:19] <theholyduck> cause its a great spectator sport
[14:56:21] <amigojapan> theholyduck: but maybe some people are not into it and pretend
[14:56:31] <theholyduck> amigojapan: somehow i doubt that : P
[14:56:45] <theholyduck> meanwhile i have never been to a baseball game. and yet i have a mlb.tv subscription and watch a bunch of baseball
[14:56:50] <theholyduck> and as much post-season baseball as i can
[14:57:05] <Berlin36> i never watched baseball
[14:57:09] <theholyduck> its a great tv game. and its basicly impossible for me to actually go to a game
[14:57:34] <theholyduck> Berlin36:  its. a nice sport for a few different types of people 
[14:57:48] <theholyduck> 1) its one of the most quantifiable sports and so much of the underlying numbers and data is availible for you to play with
[14:57:53] <amigojapan> Baseball is a little more bearable. At least I liked baseball videogames when I was a kid
[14:57:58] <theholyduck> 2) its super slow. 
[14:58:00] <Berlin36> do you guys use i2p?
[14:58:07] <theholyduck> soo you can do anything else at the same time
[14:58:19] <DunceCotus> baseball is suuuuper boring
[14:58:24] <Berlin36> oof
[14:58:25] <theholyduck> DunceCotus: as i said its a slow sport
[14:58:30] <theholyduck> i could never JUST watch baseball
[14:58:30] <DunceCotus> I went to a game when I was in the US, and it was crap
[14:58:33] <DunceCotus> but I was like 7
[14:58:35] <Berlin36> tell someone with a baseball bat that in his face
[14:58:38] <Berlin36> xd
[14:58:54] <theholyduck> DunceCotus: like for me atleast its an activity best combined with another activit
[14:58:57] <amigojapan> Lol Berlin36 
[14:58:58] <DunceCotus> Berlin36 biolence
[14:59:04] <Berlin36> basketball's cool
[14:59:09] <Berlin36> i mean look at shaq
[14:59:10] <Berlin36> or yao ming
[14:59:12] <lastonestanding> baseball bats are nice, but baseball as competitive sport is not
[14:59:15] <Berlin36> those guys are fucking giants
[14:59:19] <theholyduck> the average time between a pitch in baseball is 20 seconds. 
[14:59:22] <Berlin36> biolence
[14:59:29] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: let's organise a mob and beat up all jocks
[14:59:33] <Berlin36> ok
[14:59:34] <theholyduck> which means anything you do that you can do in less than 20 second spurts
[14:59:37] <DunceCotus> I mean its more exciting than test cricket I'll give it that
[14:59:37] <theholyduck> is perfectly combined with baseball
[14:59:52] <theholyduck> like holding a conversation with a friend

[18:09:37] <dfch> Sadale i mean it's a small shop one (also uber cheap, around HK$50-90 for small/medium ones) nothing special tbh, but I kinda liked it
[18:09:59] <dfch> I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to check it out, but if you are in the area, sure give it a try
[18:10:04] <Sadale> dfch, I'm a bit worried that it'd taste like the mini pizza on those bakeries here.
[18:10:40] <Sadale> dfch, Those are not bad. But not awesome either. And the one in bakery's far cheaper. HK$10~13 often.
[18:10:46] <dfch> yeah not the same, maybe a lil bit similar, a bit better tho lol :D
[18:11:05] <dfch> nah, def. better than hk$10 ones
[18:11:05] <Sadale> You have to get two from the bakery for a meal tho because one is too little
[18:11:16] <Sadale> dfch, I see.
[18:11:17] <amigojapan> I want to eat deep dish pizza
[18:11:51] <dfch> Sadale, it's basically your ordinary local pizza (most of the business is from delivery ofc)
[18:12:23] <Sadale> dfch, I'm now asking if my imouto'd be interested. I told her that the recommendation came from the same guy that recommended the expensive and meh pizza express tho xD
[18:12:28] <amigojapan> dfch: I don't like pizza la
[18:13:37] <amigojapan> My Japanese friends would order pizza with octopus on it
[18:13:50] <dfch> Sadale, pizza express aint expensive wtf
[18:14:20] <dfch> amigojapan, eh, after durian pizza (ptsd intensifies) I fancy pretty much every flavor now :D
[18:14:22] <Sadale> dfch, It is expensive to us. I think the two persons meal costed us like HK$300 or something :-(

[18:19:09] <Sadale> dfch, I thought that we didn't need to quarantize.
[18:19:12] <amigojapan> dfch: why is there almost no difference between the symbol for RMB and Japanese yen?
[18:19:18] <dfch> it varies from 350 to 700 rmb per night (food not included)
[18:19:36] <dfch> Sadale, if visit HK from ML, then not.
[18:19:38] <Sadale> amigojapan, The same reason why the dollar sign is used to convey pretty much any currency that's named as "dollar".
[18:19:47] <Sadale> dfch, That's no fair :(
[18:20:01] <amigojapan> I see Sadale 
[18:20:04] <dfch> amigojapan, because it's 元

[18:20:23] <dfch> Yuan=Yen=￥
[18:20:51] <Sadale> Come to think of it why the dollar sign is $? Shouldn't it be Đ?
[18:20:53] <amigojapan> Japanese Kanji for yen is 円
[18:21:04] <Sadale> The word "Dollar" doesn't start with S
[18:21:25] <amigojapan> No idea Sadale

[18:22:42] <amigojapan> Still not S lastonestanding

[18:51:08] <Berlin36> i get only shotgun shots
[18:51:11] <emmeka> Yukon territory is nice.
[18:51:28] <amigojapan> Who is Harambre?
[18:51:53] <lastonestanding> emmeka: can anyone live there or is a special permission required?
[18:52:04] <emmeka> no, anyone can live in the Yukon
[18:52:13] <emmeka> there are even roads there, to Whitehorse and Dawson City
[18:52:14] <lastonestanding> nice
[18:52:31] <Berlin36> whiterose.. Mr robot flashbacks
[18:52:32] <emmeka> lastonestanding the Yukon is the last place in this country with real homestead laws, too. Any citizen can claim any parcel of arable land still held by the crown.
[18:52:44] <lastonestanding> yukon is like a budget alaska
[18:52:47] <emmeka> of course most of the good land within a reasonable distance of Whitehorse is taken
[18:52:49] <amigojapan> emmeka: I see full schools. I see kids come and go from school and I see parks with kids playing
[18:52:51] <emmeka> Yukon > Alaska
[18:53:21] <lastonestanding> I think Alaska has more to offer
[18:53:29] <lastonestanding> no?
[18:53:38] <amigojapan> emmeka: I don't see them that much in Tokyo tho
[18:53:46] <emmeka> well, Alaska borders the Pacific, which has its benefits
[18:54:03] <emmeka> but as far as northern life, the Yukon has an oddly great climate
[18:54:14] <lastonestanding> tundra?
[18:54:22] <emmeka> its towns are all in sheltered mountain valleys, where despite the high lattitude, the temperate doesn't feel arctic
[18:54:35] <emmeka> Winnipeg for example is a colder town than Whitehorse
[18:54:44] <emmeka> despite being much, much further south
[18:55:10] <lastonestanding> do you need to be Canadian to be able to live in Yukon?
[18:55:34] <emmeka> no, but I mean, you need some sort of residency right
[18:55:46] <lastonestanding> you mentioned this homestead thingy
[18:55:55] <emmeka> need to be a citizen for that.
[18:56:23] <lastonestanding> does yukon have police to enforces those laws? :D
[18:56:25] <ButterNoodle> git winnipegged
[18:57:01] <emmeka> the Yukon is like any other part of the country except it's a "territory" and not a "province". The only difference this makes is the relation of the local government to the federal one. Territories have no constitutionally granted powers, their powers are derivative of the feds, so effectively it means the federal government can overrule everything the local government does there.
[18:57:24] <emmeka> lastonestanding the RCMP, our federal police, are there.
[18:57:47] <lastonestanding> they won't catch me in the wilderness
[18:57:56] <emmeka> you'll also die, so
[18:58:16] <lastonestanding> they'll send bears after me?
[18:58:16] <Berlin36> im afk
[18:58:25] <emmeka> the bears do not need any coaxing
[18:58:43] <amigojapan> emmeka: you read somewhere that there are few kids in Japan and assume I am wrong
[18:58:54] <emmeka> you are wrong, though, but it's k
[18:59:11] <amigojapan> emmeka: I am offended
[18:59:14] <emmeka> Japan has absurdly low birth rates, the highest birth rate areas in the country are still well below replacement
[18:59:25] <ButterNoodle> yea
[18:59:28] <ButterNoodle> I think maybe
[18:59:38] <ButterNoodle> I have heard japan talk about population decline
[18:59:39] <amigojapan> emmeka: but I said "my area
[19:00:19] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: all I really know is my area
[19:00:25] <lastonestanding> having less people isn't a bad thing
[19:00:39] <ButterNoodle> more cute girls
[19:00:41] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: it's not true here tho
[19:00:43] <ButterNoodle> less not cute girls
[19:00:44] <ButterNoodle> pls
[19:00:47] <emmeka> lastonestanding the other nice thing about Yukon vs Alaska is that the Yukon is traditionally a stronghold for the NDP, our social democratic party. It is despite being so rural, a fairly progressive place.
[19:01:13] <emmeka> whereas Alaska is full of true rednecks that vote for Republicans who can see Russia from their house
[19:01:19] <lastonestanding> emmeka: do politics even matter when hardly any humans are around?
[19:01:45] <emmeka> there's humans there. Whitehorse is like a reasonably sized town.
[19:01:51] <Sadale> People could be fighting for resources if there aren't enough people producing the resources.
[19:01:53] <amigojapan> emmeka: if it was not illegal to film kids I cloud prove it
[19:02:08] <emmeka> please do not record random children to win IRC arguments
[19:02:09] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: nature produces the resources
[19:02:13] <ButterNoodle> naturally
[19:02:28] <amigojapan> Yeah I won't emmeka 
[19:02:53] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: just say "people on the internet want me to record children"
[19:02:53] <Sadale> emmeka, unfortunate I will help amigojapan to win the IRC argument :P
[19:02:56] <Sadale> emmeka, just so you wait :P
[19:03:00] <lastonestanding> if you mess around with children, you'll get shot
[19:03:05] <lastonestanding> (see Harambe)
[19:03:09] <ButterNoodle> not in japan lastonestanding

[19:04:38] <ButterNoodle> yes
[19:04:41] <ButterNoodle> and yes
[19:04:52] <ButterNoodle> I actually work for a company with a pretty large presence in Japan
[19:05:02] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, oh cool. Good luck! :3
[19:05:15] <Sadale> Personally tho I'd never work in Japan. I'm worried about karoshi :P
[19:05:28] * Sadale is lazy :3
[19:05:38] <emmeka> salaryman life sounds a bit rough
[19:05:43] <emmeka> especially for a gaijin
[19:05:45] <ButterNoodle> so at some point I plan to leverage a position where I can work there... not 100% of the time
[19:05:50] <ButterNoodle> yea
[19:06:00] <ButterNoodle> idk if I could work for a japanese company in japan
[19:06:20] <amigojapan> Sadale: did you hear the Japanese government is considering making it a 4 day work week here?
[19:06:30] <ButterNoodle> I was interviewing with rakuten... and their pay is very low compared to the US
[19:06:35] <Sadale> ACtually I'm thinking if gaijin wouldn't be required to work as long hours as locals.
[19:06:46] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: yes
[19:06:49] <emmeka> if I was younger and had less responsibilities again, I'd consider taking a year to go around Hokkaido and work various farms in places like the Tokachi plains
[19:06:58] <davic> Sadale: I ordered my one-way ticket to PH
[19:07:00] <Sadale> That's not surprising. For tech sector the people in the US got paid well
[19:07:02] <ButterNoodle> they dont buli gaijin to work 14hrs

[19:08:51] <emmeka> the same berry that grows here grows in Hokkaido, we used to call it "honeyberry", but nowadays everyone calls it "haskap" which is based on Japanese name because most of the crop of it grown here is exported to Japan
[19:08:51] <Sadale> still, you rich

[20:29:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Aurora in spesh
[20:29:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Aura would be a shortening.

[20:30:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> привет is an informal hello.

[20:31:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm told persian? Has a rather more vulgar meaning for cosmos. Which really makes me wonder just how the etymology of both progressed for it to differ that much.

[20:36:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The (unnecessary) TPM requirement has also caused scalpers to do their stupid thing.
[20:36:48] <Sadale> who cares about Windows? :P

[20:36:59] <Berlin36> is windwos11 free?
[20:37:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Berlin36: Doubtful.
[20:37:11] <Saxle> TPM is weird because Windows only uses it for Bitlocker, which is not even in Home version.
[20:37:13] <Berlin36> is it available now?
[20:37:21] <Sadale> Should have purchased TPM and resold them now

[20:40:41] <Berlin36> yeah true

[20:42:01] <Berlin36> why would i do that
[20:42:02] <Saxle> Linux does have good Intel support, just need a lightweight desktop
[20:42:17] <klaxa> but video playback and basic 3d acceleration and shit
[20:42:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Until hyperthreading workarounds are ready in Linux & Xen, raw physical core count matters a lot to me.
[20:42:42] <klaxa> yeah amd is on the ryze(n)

[20:47:33] <Sxem> i tried cuphead but it was too hard and i didnt want to do it easy mode
[20:47:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Saxle: klaxa: Doom 2016 & Eternal run perfectly fine. A number of Ubisoft's games, if you disable anticheat and switch them to dx11, also work fine.
[20:47:57] <Saxle> Is Wine even worth using?
[20:48:01] <Berlin36> hah yeaah, it's pretty hard, but after a while i decided to play again, and it seemed pretty easy
[20:48:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Saxle: Yes.
[20:48:12] <Berlin36> i never used it
[20:48:18] <klaxa> yes, but steam os is still dead
[20:48:25] <klaxa> i play a few games on steam
[20:48:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Proton is basically a fork of Wine that vendors in some libraries.
[20:48:32] <klaxa> some even have native ports
[20:48:34] <Berlin36> yes
[20:48:37] <klaxa> but yeah proton works pretty well
[20:48:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They push stuff back to upstream Wine once in a while too
[20:48:40] <klaxa> however
[20:48:46] <klaxa> it's still totally niche
[20:48:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So the main benefit is really just the unified experience.
[20:48:55] <Berlin36> what distro do u use?
[20:49:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For gaming? Arch.
[20:49:05] <klaxa> fedora, because i'm a lazy bum
[20:49:17] <Saxle> Ubuntu here
[20:49:23] <Berlin36> what's your all time favourite?
[20:49:28] <klaxa> fedora, because i'm a lazy bum
[20:49:32] <Berlin36> xd
[20:49:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Wine will generally run most things without anti-cheat without issue, so long as the graphics APIs used are supported. dx12/vulkan is WIP.
[20:50:01] <klaxa> it's still way too much hassle
[20:50:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cyberpunk 2077 works, but sometimes the latest version of the master branch still breaks for mesa.
[20:50:05] <Berlin36> i tried fedora, and i still have it, but didn't use too much
[20:50:10] <klaxa> >it's more than double click? fuck this shit
[20:50:19] <klaxa> ^ average user
[20:50:19] <Berlin36> lol
[20:50:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> mesa being the vulkan support implementation.
[20:50:31] <Saxle> I hear NVIDIA graphics support on linux is terrible. I don't even want to try it on my gaming pc.
[20:50:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Erh, opengl & vulkan
[20:50:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> sort of
[20:50:49] <Berlin36> yeah fuck nvidia
[20:51:00] <klaxa> all this knowledge is useless if you >just use windows lmao
[20:51:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hard to be very clear when the libraries are co-dependent
[20:51:09] <klaxa> and that's what people want
[20:51:13] <klaxa> they just want to use their computer
[20:51:20] <klaxa> bill gates did a real doozie on us
[20:51:27] <klaxa> not like we can change it now
[20:51:51] <Berlin36> what i don't like is when ppl request some help with fucking windows
[20:51:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> klaxa: Sure we can. Who wants to pay for his OS? Who wants to be at the mercy of their unreliable ISP for access to pictures they thought they saved locally?
[20:52:12] <klaxa> people who's time is not worthless
[20:52:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Yes, Windows 11 makes the cloud/botnet bullshit worse)
[20:52:14] <Berlin36> i didn't even use windows for more than browsing and some games
[20:52:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> klaxa: Everyone's time is ultimately worthless

[20:54:49] <Berlin36> oof

[20:56:46] <klaxa> people rather pay 100 bucks so they don't have to give a shit about crap
[20:56:53] <klaxa> i don't see how that is so hard to understand
[20:57:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And anticheat is not an issue if you buy the games through steam, which explicitly supports Linux.
[20:57:04] <klaxa> linux is free if your time is worthless
[20:57:11] <klaxa> most people value their time more than $0
[20:57:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Obviously not if they pay to spend it on games.

[20:57:45] <Saxle> klaxa: Yea Linux is not ready for most people yet. But many people are now using Chromebooks and Android so at least they get some knowledge of it.
[20:57:47] <klaxa> except it does explicitly state that there is a selection of games tested with proton and everything else is without warranty
[20:57:52] * Sadale invites klaxa to join #windows
[20:58:07] <Saxle> lol
[20:58:15] <klaxa> you don't gain any linux knowledge through android and chrome os usage
[20:58:23] <Berlin36> it depends
[20:58:27] <Sadale> Personally for non-gaming stuffs tho I do prefer using linux.
[20:58:37] <klaxa> if you are not a nerd already you will not
[20:58:42] <Berlin36> i started learning bash from an android shell emulator lol
[20:58:51] <Berlin36> i didn't even know what was linux back then
[20:59:06] <Berlin36> welp i somehow managed to understand something
[20:59:10] <Sadale> I'm a bit different. I started off with installing linux on my desktop.
[20:59:27] <Sadale> That was tough. xD
[20:59:30] <Berlin36> i started with Termux (emulator on android)
[20:59:35] <Sadale> cool! :3
[20:59:38] <Berlin36> and then i installed Lubuntu
[20:59:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I installed Linux when my PC became too old to play modern games and my family couln't afford neither upgrading it nor the stupidly high costs of Windows.
[20:59:51] <Berlin36> i loved it 
[21:00:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because Free & free is a much better value proposition when you're poor.
[21:00:00] <Saxle> I started linux on and off since 2009
[21:00:05] <Sadale> me too. Except for gaming, really.
[21:00:23] <Berlin36> i use linux for about... 8 months now
[21:00:23] <Sadale> So I've installed Windows on an external SSD for Windows-only games.
[21:00:34] <Berlin36> i have wind10 on dual boot
[21:00:43] <Berlin36> but never actually booting
[21:00:45] <Berlin36> lol
[21:01:03] <Sadale> I like how linux's more configurable than Windows. For average users tho I think that windows or even macos would probably suit them better. Those are more mainstream and better supported.
[21:01:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And I watch more anime and read more manga & literature than I play games.
[21:01:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Linux can do the first three just fine.
[21:01:22] <Sadale> For linux there's a pretty steep learning curve.
[21:01:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Well, the userspace can. Linux really doesn't matter. VLC and mpv work fine on Hurd too.
[21:01:38] <Sadale> And when thing breaks it's gonna take time and skill to fix.

[21:05:50] <Sadale> Aurora_v_kosmose, not sure. It's just someone told me that he joined here because reddit anime channel on freenode's dead.
[21:06:07] <Sadale> Aurora_v_kosmose, actually I think their subreddit is intact.
[21:06:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ah I see. So a third channel I'd never even heard of.

[21:09:09] <Matt|home> .. just out of curiosity, does anyone _actually_ live everyday like its their last
[21:09:31] <Nanobot> That would be a terrible way to live.

[21:11:33] <Berlin36> nah, drugs are shit
[21:11:33] <Matt|home> man.. i don't have any right now
[21:12:11] <Berlin36> what country you from? if you prefer to say of course
[21:12:27] <amigojapan> Matt|home: if your live every day like it is your last why haven't you spent all your money in one day?
[21:13:05] <Berlin36> why haven't you fucked with 10 chicks in one hour
[21:13:24] <Berlin36> if it's the last day...
[21:13:26] <Nanobot> Moona: Joins Hololive because she wants to be a singer. Has an amazing voice. Gets famous for Minecraft.

[21:14:16] <Sadale> Don't worry about people who told you to live everyday as if it's their last one. Some people are just delusional to think that they could keep being productive every single day, while they couldn't at all. :P

[21:14:48] <Saxle> Work to live; not live to work.

[21:17:38] <JesseDesu> maybe emmeka will like it
[21:17:53] <Matt|home> man i've got way too much to do.. but none of it is _urgent_ right now

[21:18:41] <JesseDesu> hmmmph?
[21:18:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So effectively every day is like my last day.
[21:18:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And that informs how much bullshit I'm willing to tolerate.
[21:19:05] <Matt|home> man.. if i were you i'd burn down every building i could get my hands on if i was that fucked. life has not been kind to me
[21:19:27] <Sadale> aww that's an exhausting day. I've just done with programming task for the day (hobbyist project) and it's 00:50 now. :(
[21:19:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You have kilometers of blood vessels in your body and a single one popping at the wrong place will ruin your life if it doesn't just kill you.

[21:24:13] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: it's the worst, I asked about it online, got a japanese person who said there's a slight difference that no one cares about, then tried to explain in english but their english is bad so now I'm even worse off
[21:24:18] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: and I should probably stop caring
[21:24:22] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I see. But I don't think I can help much more with that. Also tomako is asleep
[21:24:37] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: BUT I feel the need to point out that the word "storefront" in english apparently doesn't mean what japanese people who learned english think it means
[21:24:56] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: which has just had me thinking weird things about language, but it's interesting
[21:25:16] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: it's fine, I just wanted to mention it, because I've been obsessing and at least you know what I'm talking about
[21:25:26] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I don't expect anything more from you, you already asked, that's all you can do
[21:25:41] <JesseDesu> dont expect anything from amigo
[21:25:43] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: just it's sort of like me coming back to a conversation we were having before, because I've been thinking about it (too much)
[21:26:05] <amigojapan> I see TsundereNoises 
[21:26:17] <TsundereNoises> JesseDesu: I except some things, like next christmas I expect amigo to be annoyed at christmas
[21:26:21] <TsundereNoises> if this didn't happen, I would worry
[21:27:04] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: so I mean I think they must have some kind of nuance difference, but also get used interchangably, and now I'm pretty sure this really doesn't matter, but I can't stop wanting to know the answer
[21:27:09] <JesseDesu> i'm washing like, 30 pairs of socks right now
[21:27:19] <JesseDesu> its suprisingly compact
[21:27:21] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: isn't a storefront like the area of the entrance to the store? Where they show like the big bargains?
[21:27:22] <JesseDesu> for a load
[21:27:40] *** Quits: Berlin36 (~Berlin36@user/berlin36) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[21:27:47] <JesseDesu> i want big bargains
[21:27:55] <JesseDesu> big soft squishy bargains
[21:27:59] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I THINK 店先 might have more of an emphasis on 店の前, like outside, in a way 店頭 doesn't, but I don't realyl know that
[21:28:14] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: computers 80& off
[21:28:15] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: no, in english "storefront" generally means the outside
[21:28:33] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: "front of the store" and "storefront" aren't really the same thing
[21:28:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> A storefront is generally the display with overpriced stuff no one buys.
[21:28:59] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: and so I can't tell if I'm projecting that feeling or not
[21:29:15] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: some stores have goods outside others don't
[21:29:19] <TsundereNoises> Aurora_v_kosmose: at least in the US, it's not the displays as such though
[21:29:30] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yes, exactly, I think it's a confusing issue!
[21:30:04] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: in ENGLISH at least, the good outside (or not) aren't important to the word "storefront"
[21:30:29] <TsundereNoises> but maybe they are in japanese? I think people latch onto some definition they see early and don't think deeper about what the word means
[21:30:37] <TsundereNoises> not just in japanese, in all language
[21:30:51] <ButterNoodle> I want to be in all language
[21:30:54] <ButterNoodle> if she's cute
[21:31:04] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: both examines tomako have were about putting items so they could be seen on the store front. Wether it was misesaki or tentou
[21:31:32] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yeah, that got me thinking, there's also the meaning of tentou as being like "stuff you buy in the actual store" right?
[21:31:45] <TsundereNoises> as opposed to online?
[21:32:03] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: we have not even touched on online
[21:32:30] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: everything we mentioned was about phisical stores
[21:32:39] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yeah anyway, what tomako said but me thinking, but yeah, I get that it's not some simple answer
[21:32:57] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yeah, I meant it seems like there's a different use of the word too, but I don't care about that really
[21:33:16] <amigojapan> Ok
[21:34:05] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: sorry. It is 2àm and am getting sleepy
[21:34:39] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: In english, I love to think about the differences between similar words, a lot of people will say words mean the same thing, but they don't ACTUALLY use them in exactly the same way, there are nuances to the words they use without thinking
[21:34:45] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: have a good night, sorry to keep you up
[21:35:23] <amigojapan> No problem TsundereNoises 
[21:35:35] <amigojapan> Good night TsundereNoises 
[21:35:45] <amigojapan> Bye everyone
[21:36:01] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: anyway, the fact that multiple japanese people seem to think "storefront" in english means something slightly different than what it really means has me thinking
[21:36:02] <TsundereNoises> goodnight
[21:36:56] <amigojapan> I see TsundereNoises I hope we can fix the obsession but for now I'm going to sleep
[21:37:07] <TsundereNoises> おやすみ

[23:30:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's probably for something like optimizing hot codepaths in programs while they're running.
[23:30:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Basically partly bruteforcing their way around the halting problem.
[23:30:50] <lastonestanding> like a monkey fighting a snake
[23:31:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because there's optimizations that can break a program.
[23:31:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Mind you, I'm going off guesswork here.
[23:31:20] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose:  do you like the french
[23:31:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: I suppose it's an okay language.
[23:31:45] <MootPoot> "the" french
[23:31:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Kind of complicated but so is English.
[23:31:50] <MootPoot> not french the language
[23:31:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> the french?
[23:31:58] <hassoon> dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooods
[23:31:59] <MootPoot> yes
[23:32:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: No idea what that refers to.
[23:32:09] <MootPoot> the french people
[23:32:14] <MootPoot> france
[23:32:15] <hassoon> what about them
[23:32:21] <MootPoot> do you like them
[23:32:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> oh, the French as a people.
[23:32:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> About as much as I like anyone in general.
[23:32:35] <hassoon> why should i MootPoot ?
[23:33:00] <MootPoot> idk, hassoon  why would you?
[23:33:03] <MootPoot> I was asking Aurora_v_kosmose  
[23:33:11] <MootPoot> good, you should not like the french
[23:33:16] <MootPoot> they cut off penises
[23:33:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: That... literally doesn't matter as far as I'm concerned?
[23:33:27] <MootPoot> and they speak french
[23:33:43] <lastonestanding> the french gave america freedom
[23:33:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The main french things I care about are Framasoft and the INRIA institute.
[23:33:50] <MootPoot> what are those
[23:33:52] <MootPoot> nani kore

[23:34:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Basically consider them a bit like a French EFF

[23:43:38] <MootPoot> oh
[23:43:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Free Software and internet freedom stuff
[23:43:57] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose:  sometimes I forget that you're not Katrin  
[23:51:11] <MootPoot> actually
[23:51:15] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose:  I was incorrect
[23:51:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah, different person.
[23:51:25] <MootPoot> half of what I use is not gaming on my PC
[23:51:27] <MootPoot> its like 
[23:51:34] <MootPoot> these days at least
[23:51:51] <MootPoot> 70% youtube and anime, 20% gaming  and 10% work
[23:52:02] <MootPoot> although youtube and anime tends to swap around
[23:52:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Understandable.
[23:52:17] <MootPoot> I dip in and out of different hobbies
[23:52:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In my case the gaming proprtion is much smaller, and some of the youtube&anime is replaced with "messing around with programming & software"
[23:52:50] * MootPoot gasps
[23:52:54] <MootPoot> YOU REPLACED ANIME
[23:54:06] <MootPoot> but yeah it used to be like 70-80% gaming
[23:54:14] <MootPoot> but it swaps forward and back really often
[23:54:36] <MootPoot> I'm not one of those poeple who play games nonstop and then at one point was like "fuck video games forever"
[23:54:52] <MootPoot> who used to play*
[23:56:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I sometimes get moments where I just blaze through some game or another. Like Doom Eternal. But then I get back to basically no gaming for... however many weeks.
[23:56:25] <MootPoot> I know
[23:56:25] <MootPoot> same
[23:56:42] <MootPoot> I'll be like playing games for 5-7 hours for 2-4 weeks nonstop
[23:56:45] <MootPoot> then nothing for a month
[23:56:47] <MootPoot> then back to it
[23:56:59] <Sxem> ive been playing games for about an hour per day for decades
[23:57:16] <MootPoot> the biggest issue for me is that its REALLY hard for me to just "play a little" or hop in and out of games
[23:57:33] <MootPoot> playing a story game like 2hr, then coming back a week later is like
[23:57:38] <MootPoot> wtf was I doing
[23:57:46] <ButterNoodle> masturbating
[23:57:55] <MootPoot> ^
[23:58:03] <ButterNoodle> picking the next route
[23:58:16] <ButterNoodle> so u get to bang the blind girl
[23:58:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> dat VN
[23:58:38] <ButterNoodle> :)
[23:58:51] <MootPoot> tbh if I REALLY wanted to do linux
[23:59:11] <MootPoot> what I would do is swap around gpus
[23:59:20] <MootPoot> run a gtx 1060 with my 5900x
[23:59:26] <ButterNoodle> I dont have a gpu in a linux box
[23:59:35] <MootPoot> put my 3080 with the 10th gen in a i5 and run windows on that
[23:59:41] <MootPoot> then upgrade network to 10g
[23:59:47] <MootPoot> play 4k games over LAN
