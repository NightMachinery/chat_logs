[15:38:29] <lumberjack123> like I said

[15:38:56] <lumberjack123> *key metadata
[15:40:00] <gnoo> use lumber@example.tld, it's not like it actually verifies your email
[15:40:34] <gnoo> and 'lumber jack' as your username
[15:41:07] <gnoo> fun fact, you don't really have to type the whole thing out durng encryption, just some characters (hit & trial baby) should be enough to select the correct key
[15:48:03] <henk> lumberjack123: works for me. show what exactly you are doing and what exactly happens on a pastebin.
[15:49:02] <henk> oh, no, it actually doesnâ€™t o_O
[15:49:33] <henk> it treats space as a character and I didnâ€™t count it m(
[15:49:58] <henk> but email address can be empty
[15:50:31] <labrador_> lumberjack123, gnupg is meant to be used with email
[15:50:37] <labrador_> But you can leave it blank sure
[16:07:48] <lumberjack123> henk: if I did not have @ character in email address it failed with this error :  Diese Email-Adresse ist ungÃ¼ltig
[16:08:18] <lumberjack123> labrador_: I could not leave blank, I do not see why I need to type a string with @ character in it just to generate keypair
[16:09:01] <labrador_> lumberjack123, because its intended to be used with email
[16:11:10] <henk> lumberjack123: well, an email address does need to have an @ in it â€¦ but since you can leave that empty, I donâ€™t blame gpg for requiring that.
[16:29:22] <lumberjack123> labrador_: I think GPG has more uses than email, and I don't want to expose that metadata in key info
[16:29:37] <lumberjack123> I don't think it should force me to type email address
