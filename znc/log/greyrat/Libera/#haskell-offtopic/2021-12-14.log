[15:29:07] <dminuoso> https://gitlab.com/wobcom/haskell/log4j-detector-hs/
[15:29:46] <dminuoso> If any of you care for it, we made this version of another java-based detector to work at constant low memory and reasonable speed.
[15:30:18] <tomsmeding> why do I need to sign in to gitlab to even see that
[15:30:36] *** aweinsto1k is now known as aweinstock
[15:30:49] <dminuoso> Oh hold on!
[15:30:51] <dminuoso> Sorry
[15:31:05] <tomsmeding> oh is it private? that explains :)
[15:31:10] <dminuoso> Default policy is to make private projects. :)
[15:31:11] <dminuoso> Yeah
[15:31:14] <dminuoso> It's made public now
[15:31:24] <tomsmeding> I almost concluded that gitlab made some weird decisions lately
[15:33:31] <tomsmeding> was the java detector so bad then?

[15:34:17] <dminuoso> On any non-trivial jar file it would explode in memory usage and just quit
[15:34:29] <tomsmeding> ... how
[15:34:36] <dminuoso> And it's frustrating slow. Compared to this tool, about 10 times slower
[15:34:42] <tomsmeding> lol
[15:34:52] <dminuoso> They eagerly unzip these jars
[15:35:09] <tomsmeding> ah right
[15:35:15] <tomsmeding> instead of only the interesting files?
[15:35:29] <dminuoso> Right, and even then they do it all in memory
[15:35:36] <dminuoso> This tool just pushes them onto a temp directory
[15:36:05] <dminuoso> Most servers here have a few gigabytes or free disk space, but not memory
[15:36:47] <tomsmeding> makes sense
[15:37:19] <dminuoso> Also the java variant is poorly written spaghetti code that I cant reason about
[15:37:26] <dminuoso> There's that. *shrugs*
[15:38:11] <tomsmeding> yay haskell
[15:38:42] <tomsmeding> upside of a java tool is that people who are dealing with log4j probably have the required tools available to build a java tool
[15:38:46] <tomsmeding> not so much for haskell
[15:38:57] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: Thing is, log4j is extremely ubiquitous
[15:39:11] <dminuoso> Do you have a graylog?
[15:39:18] <dminuoso> If so, which elastic search plugins are installed?
[15:39:23] <dminuoso> Some of them use log4j
[15:39:49] <tomsmeding> right
[15:40:44] <tomsmeding> it makes sense, but it's nevertheless somehow funny that plugins for a log management system use a different logging framework
[15:45:52] <[exa]> avoiding fixpoint, java style
[15:47:27] <tomsmeding> about fixpoint, is this function defined anywhere standard? fixpoint :: Eq a => (a -> a) -> a -> a ; fixpoint f x = let y = f x in if y == x then x else fixpoint f y
[15:49:27] <tomsmeding> alternatively, fixpoint f x = fst (fromJust (find (uncurry (==)) (iterate (((,) <$> id <*> f) . snd) (x, f x))))
[15:57:05] <tomsmeding> or is that off-offtopic
[15:59:08] <tomsmeding> @pf fix (\r f x -> let y = f x in if x == y then x else r f y)

[16:37:48] <tomsmeding> ah I see
[16:38:00] <tomsmeding> so the other members still have to get stuff to you
[16:39:11] <merijn> And it basically boils down to "Your chapters list "contains work previously published in", but they're not all peer reviewed" (because there's 1 arXiv preprint and a few datasets, etc.). Like, if that's the biggest complaint you can come up with, that sounds like a non-issue for me :p
[16:43:08] <Athas> Hmm.
[16:43:32] <Athas> For some reason I think about how slaughterhouses are set up to keep the cattle calm right until they get the knife.
[16:43:39] <Athas> No idea why that came into my ahead.
