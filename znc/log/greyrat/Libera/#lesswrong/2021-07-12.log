[00:57:49] <Mateon1> So, normally, after I wash, shower, whatever, I have a long sleeve shirt or other long sleeved piece of clothing ready. That's mostly because I'm hypersensitive to some stimuli like very fine rough textures (ex. paper) and found avoidance to be easier than trying to 'actually fix it', so I got used to wearing long sleeves at all times
[00:59:27] <Mateon1> Now, however, I did not have any long sleeved clothes prepared after my washing routine, and since in pandemic times I don't have to touch any actual paper since everything is electronic and remote, and such I decided getting them wasn't a priority
[01:00:34] <Mateon1> Now that I'm dry, I'm feeling the sensory experience of air moving the hairs on my forearms, and it's such a weird feeling after not having it for almost a decade

[01:40:02] <feepbot> Shawn Presser – updown.io (blog: https://blog.gpt4.org)
[01:40:05] <shawwwn> I got a zapier notification and everything
[01:40:09] <gwern> 'The new tools have shown that CLIP provides a kind of backdoor method to reproducing the abilities of DALL·E. Given the fact that OpenAI withheld DALL·E, it would seem that the company might have been caught off guard. “I definitely suspect that they're a little bit surprised that it could do all this,” Murdock said.' <-- I definitely agree. I think they thought that it'd be basically...
[01:40:15] <gwern> ...just imagenet classification and the zero-shots they demonstrated
[01:40:43] <shawwwn> Definitely (3x definitely)
[01:40:49] <feep> well, but also
[01:40:55] <feep> clip+vqgan is kinda shit compared to dall-e
[01:41:05] <feep> I think they just have a hard time predicting what people will find cool
[01:41:24] <shawwwn> I mean
[01:41:32] <feep> for instance, I'd expect they thought jukebox would be considered cooler than it was
[01:41:39] <shawwwn> Suppose dalle came out. Stylegan wouldn’t have been affected
[01:41:41] <gwern> I did too ;_;
[01:41:45] <feep> me too ;.;
[01:41:56] <shawwwn> But clip lets people toy with stylegan and all other models
[01:42:08] <shawwwn> So it’s hard to say which one would be cooler
[01:42:24] <shawwwn> Note also that most of the dalle examples we’ve seen are cherry picked. Nothing wrong with that
[01:42:27] <feep> right but I feel like, if people could get dalle-tier quality out of clip, they probably wouldn't go in the sort of impressionistic stylegan direction
[01:42:36] <shawwwn> But we don’t quite know what dalle quality is
[01:42:52] <feep> I mean, clipgan is also cherrypicked
[01:42:59] <gwern> I still don't understand what happened there. everyone goes nuts for music, usually. jukebox is an *incredible* leap over the previous SOTA, which basically didn't exist at all because it's such an absurdly hard problem to generate raw audio in the full diversity of pop/rock with raw from scratch singing voices (!). they released thousands of samples in a very slick website, had a...
[01:43:04] <feep> and I have never seen a generated image that was as good as the worst of dalle.
[01:43:05] <gwern> ...competition, and even released the model itself.
[01:43:14] <shawwwn> Well, they didn’t release their model gwern
[01:43:18] <feep> gwern: I think music just has a big meh valley
[01:43:22] <shawwwn> It’s why I’ve been hounding everybody to release their models
[01:43:22] <gwern> shawwwn: I'm talking about jukebox
[01:43:23] <Mateon1> I've been looking at dall-e images again, and it does feel like it 'overfits' certain shapes and patterns, even just based on the released images. That may be why it looks so good
[01:43:25] <shawwwn> Yes
[01:43:28] <shawwwn> I am too
[01:43:29] <gwern> they released jukebox
[01:43:32] <shawwwn> They did?
[01:43:35] <gwern> sure did
[01:43:37] <shawwwn> As a model?!
[01:43:39] <gwern> even nshepperd here was using it
[01:43:40] <feep> tbf it's really slow

[01:44:23] <Mateon1> "coffee table" in the "form" of a "pikachu" looks especially odd, it can't reconcile the two shapes, so it just places a pikachu figurine on a table or on something else entirely

[01:49:57] <Mateon1> gwern: Ehh, I've seen how badly AI can behave in parts of the latent space it doesn't expect. Take the failure cases in world models AIs, for instance. But I've also trained various kinds of nets and explored their behavior outside their normal parameter range. Total chaos.
[01:49:57] <Mateon1> Similar things happen if you exceed parameters in basically any AI, most obvious in generative AIs where you can twiddle PCA knobs, where extreme values give total nonsense. I'm assuming similar failure cases exist in GPT-2, GPT-3 and DALL-E, except the unexpected parameters are inside the net rather than at the front.

[03:06:39] <feep> no like
[03:06:50] <feep> the *series* have genealogy, like, of series.
[03:07:04] <quanticle> Ah
[03:07:25] <Mateon1> Sometimes you may not care about the original media, but care about derivative works like fanfiction. For me that's most noticeable with Worm, I can't stand the original, but there's tons of fanfiction of it I like. Length-wise that goes for Pokemon, there are like a thousand anime episodes by now, no way I'm watching all of that, but I like some of the fanfic
[03:07:53] <Mateon1> Thus I read plot summaries, skim through wikis, and so on
[03:08:16] <Betawolf> Pokemon is certainly an area where the fanfic can be better than the original.
[03:10:09] <Mateon1> With games, I tend to find that I have less fun playing the game than watching a 'good' let's player, with the exception of puzzle and puzzle-like games
[03:10:23] <feep> quanticle: the thing about fate is ... like, if you look at comic books, or doctor who
[03:10:32] <Mateon1> Which may or may not be more relevant for the Kingdom Hearts case
[03:10:45] <quanticle> Betawolf: Going back to your point about translations, in the case of games, sometimes the games are on older hardware that you might not have access to.
[03:10:49] <feep> it either falls into a total rut, or it gets rebooted

[03:10:57] <Mateon1> Hm, doesn't KH have a massive fanfic community? I'd guess a major chunk of it doesn't actually play all the games
[03:11:05] <quanticle> And then hunt around on eBay for this one game?
[03:11:05] <Mateon1> So there's your target audience
[03:11:12] <Betawolf> quanticle: I mean, emulators are a thing, but I do take your point.
[03:11:19] <feep> and fate is ....... like, it's like dc if it never, ever, got rebooted, or memory holed, and absolutely everything that ever happened in it is still absolutely canon
[03:11:30] <quanticle> Emulators, especially for the PS1/PS2 are actually *not* very good
[03:11:41] <feep> but also the company had a guy who was really really into coherent worldbuilding so it sort of all fits together?
[03:11:43] <quanticle> SNES, sure
[03:12:15] <feep> actually, doctor who is not a bad comparison
[03:12:15] <Betawolf> I mean, I've played FF13 on my linux laptop with no problems using a PS2 emulator.
[03:12:38] <quanticle> Lucky. R-Type Final is still horribly glitchy on all the PS2 emulators I've tried
[03:12:41] <adiabatic> FF13 emulation is probably going to be aggressively debugged
[03:12:52] <adiabatic> less popular games? meh
[03:13:16] <feep> hm, another way to phrase it would be that the nasuverse is less like a ... like, a plot of a story, and more like worm, a story *engine*.
[03:13:34] <feep> only without the built-in apocalypse.
[03:14:09] <feep> and all the series are more like splatbooks
[03:14:27] <feep> actually, if you just take "Fate" in all the titles and replace it with "d20"...
[03:14:55] <Betawolf> I didn't test a load of games, so can't really say. That and Samurai Warriors, Deus Ex, Star Ocean, uh... some fighter games? I do remember Red Faction didn't work, which was annoying.
[03:15:09] <feep> wait you played deus ex with a ps2 emulator?
[03:15:11] <feep> .. why?
[03:15:29] <Betawolf> I first played it on a PS2, so it seemed appropriate
[03:17:08] <feep> it has an opengl engine! it works perfectly on wine!
[03:17:09] <Betawolf> (er, turns out I meant FF12, 13 wasn't even for PS2)
[03:17:48] <feep> with full resolution!

[04:01:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> So in the early 90s - not long before my family left Russia - as you know there were widespread shortages of everything, you couldn't buy food or basic household goods, etc.
[04:01:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> (glad you enjoyed)
[04:02:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, one day my mother was passing by the local subway station and she saw a guy with a little table set up, selling lightbulbs
[04:02:42] <quanticle> Did the lightbulbs, er, work?
[04:02:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> So she figured "yeah, let me buy a few, never know when we'll need" and she goes to buy several bulbs
[04:02:59] <shawwwn> kuudes: I'm not very good at chess, but I'll play
[04:03:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> As she's taking the money out of her purse she peers at one of the bulbs and sees that - it's burned out!
[04:03:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> She looks at the other bulbs the guy gave her - also bad!
[04:04:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> And my mother gets angry, obviously, like - "hey! these bulbs are all bad!"
[04:04:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> But instead of denying it or yelling at her, the guy nods and says calmly "Yes, of course. They're all burned out. I don't make any secret of that."
[04:04:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now my mother's just confused; she's like "... but why...? and why are all these people buying them??"

[04:18:17] <gwern> how many people have been to the boeing plant? it... can't be very many
[04:18:32] <quanticle> Yes, which is why I keep hyping it up
[04:18:41] <gwern> I mean, we're not talking Six Flags or the Smithsonian museums here in terms of big tourist destinations
[04:18:50] <saturn2> i've been to boing boing
[04:19:09] <saturn2> close enough probably
[04:19:11] <gwern> it seems a bit like saying, "if you've never climbed mount everest, I recommend it, it'll totally destroy your sense of scale" "oh thanks but I've been, and yeah, it's really something"
[04:19:29] <quanticle> Well, this is considerably *easier* and *cheaper* than climbing Mount Everest
[04:19:54] <quanticle> And with much less risk of death
[04:19:58] <gwern> but still quite rare! I wouldn't be super surprised if boeing tours are within an order or so of mt everest visitors

[04:21:42] <quanticle> And the Boeing plant is bigger :)

[04:22:07] <shawwwn> I always think too long tho
[04:22:13] <gwern> hm, is it bigger? the NYC amazon warehouse is apparently absolutely titanic
[04:22:40] <quanticle> The Boeing factory in Everett holds the world record for largest enclosed space
[04:22:56] <quanticle> It's a building that makes jetliners look like toys
[04:23:10] <quanticle> The building has its own goddamn weather
[04:24:18] <quanticle> There's a 747 parked over on the side which they use for avionics testing, and you think, "Nah, that must be a scale model or something..." and it slowly dawns on you that no, that is actually a full-size 747. It just looks like a model because the rest of the building is that huge.
[04:24:42] <quanticle> That's what I meant by it destroys your sense of scale
[04:25:27] <quanticle> The only downside of the tour is that there's no photography allowed.
[04:26:04] <quanticle> I... don't properly understand why, except that they also assemble planes for the US Air Force in that building, and so, I guess there's just a general sense of paranoia

[04:34:29] <ggreer> ah
[04:34:47] <gwern> I discovered it myself, then doing lit review, found his very short letter to _Nature_ in 1990

[04:35:11] <Robomot> PDF (1 pages; 627 KB) - Doc 6255.indd
[04:35:34] <gwern> yeah
[04:35:47] <gwern> I very much doubt he's the first person to ever notice it. he's just the earliest I've found
[04:36:17] <gwern> people have been playing with and scooping earwax out of their ears for eons, even before hearing aids
[04:36:44] <gwern> anyway since it was fully 30 years ago, you can imagine that I'm pleased he's still alive to learn that I might've solved the mystery
[04:36:47] <quanticle> Did he just know about the earwax, or did he also know about the valeric acid?
[04:36:59] <gwern> just the earwax. I am the first person to ever bring up valeric acid, I believe
[04:37:09] <quanticle> Wow
[04:37:14] <ggreer> a quarter century but the mystery is solved
[04:37:16] <gwern> he didn't learn anything after that Nature letter, incidentally
[04:37:20] <quanticle> Literally you could have gotten a PhD for this
[04:37:43] <gwern> hah. for a PhD, I'd have to do a lot more. at the very least, I'd need to physically *get* some damn valeric acid and test it on cats
[04:38:00] <quanticle> That's seems like a not-that-difficult thing to do
[04:38:11] <gwern> which would be easy if I was a grad student, I'd just ask the chemistry department to order some from sigma aldrich or something -_-
[04:38:28] <ggreer> so for cats, earwax is like licking a toad
[04:38:36] <gwern> but frigging SA requires paperwork and bona fides if you're not at a university or smth
[04:39:04] <ggreer> who knows? maybe you'll be the first honorary degree issued to a pseudonym
[04:39:14] <gwern> I think satoshi has already gotten a bunch
[04:39:20] <ggreer> (sadly that title is probably already taken... yeah)
[04:39:36] <ggreer> but he doesn't count because he got rich before he got degrees
[04:40:02] <quanticle> Also he did something lame like invent a brand new revolutionary digital currency
[04:40:08] <quanticle> Not like gwern
[04:40:16] <quanticle> Who solved the mysteries of *cats*
[04:40:36] <gwern> you'd think so but no one seems to want to discuss cats and earwax. I link it on reddit and twitter etc, and zilch
[04:40:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wait did gwern solve it?
[04:40:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Finally?
[04:40:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> What's the solution
[04:40:59] <quanticle> Earwax contains the same chemical as valerian
[04:41:03] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: human earwax contains a chemical also in valerian root extract, which cats find highly pungent and attractive
[04:41:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ahaha
[04:41:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> I knew about cats and valerian
[04:41:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's amazing that that's the connection
[04:41:49] <gwern> isn't it? my jaw dropped when I opened the WP tab for 'Pentanoic acid' and saw 'Valeric acid'. 'NO FUCKING WAY'

[05:05:09] <nshepperd> smug twitter personalities
[05:05:44] <ggreer> "vaccines don't work" is a statement uttered by two different groups of people who believe different things. one group believes that the vaccines are actually useless or possibly harmful (OG anti-vaxxers). the other group believes that vaccines help, but that the risk of covid is so great that we must still isolate and wear masks and all that
[05:06:40] <ggreer> one of my friends is in the latter group. despite the fact that both of us were vaccinated, he refused to meet with me unless it was outside. even then he was uneasy about getting close
[05:06:58] <rmmh> Just need to find a pharmacist with gambling debts that I can bribe to vax my kids
[05:06:59] <catern> i'd like to continue isolating because otherwise my boss will eventually make me go into the office
[05:07:15] <gwern> rmmh: unsure
[05:07:46] <catern> also wearing a mask seems like a sensible personal health intervention, plus it's good for opposing the surveillance state
[05:07:50] <ggreer> rmmh: kids have insanely strong immune systems. the number of kid covid deaths is ridiculously tiny
[05:08:09] <catern> so I can see why someone might take all these things and then start believing that therefore covid must still be a problem
[05:08:36] <nshepperd> wearing a mask sucks though

[05:26:59] <nshepperd> the naive method of sampling is this: repeatedly run gpt on your partially complete sample, each time sampling a token from the output logits[:, -1, :]
[05:27:09] <nshepperd> but this is horribly slow
[05:27:27] <shawwwn> but why does it work if you *don't* cache it? why is this optional?
[05:27:27] <nshepperd> it's O(length^3)
[05:27:34] *** Joins: topdownjimmy (~topdownji@user/topdownjimmy)
[05:28:15] <gwern> so it's just an optimization to bring it down from l^3 to l?
[05:28:24] <shawwwn> shuddap gwern, I'm the one learning
[05:29:18] <shawwwn> I'm confused because all it's doing is prepending the k and v vectors with "some magic numbers", and those magic numbers are making things faster
[05:29:35] <nshepperd> the smart method of sampling is to repeatedly run gpt on the last generated token, caching the self attention stuff so that each step just requires an O(l) self-attention for that last timestep
[05:29:38] <shawwwn> (I get that the magic numbers are actually the outputs from the previous timestep, but I don't get why making vectors bigger could possibly make things faster)
[05:29:57] <nshepperd> this brings it down to O(l^2) to generate the whole sample

[05:32:00] <nshepperd> the input to the self attention at that later

[05:34:33] <nshepperd> basically instead of invoking model(hparams, your_whole_goddam_string, past=None) you do model(hparams, the_last_generated_token, past=all the cached values from the previous steps)
[05:35:04] <shawwwn> oh.
[05:35:25] <shawwwn> that makes more sense.
[05:36:09] <nshepperd> the sample.py in that repo encapsulates that sampling process in some incomprehensible tensorflow bullshit

[05:36:53] <shawwwn> sadly I have to start with someone else's code, which although simple, is still rather incomprehensible to me
[05:37:18] <shawwwn> I guess my last question would be, why only k and v? why not q too?
[05:37:55] <shawwwn> the "past" only caches k and v, but that's kind of strange to me since I would've assumed it'd need to store something related to q as well

[06:31:20] *** Quits: two2thehead (~AVX0@27.114.186.18) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:32:23] <gwern> there's a certain something to it. it's not quite chuunibyou... I think. the Nasuverse seems to be off-kilter in some way from JRPGs. I've never seen anyone quite crystallize what is so JRPGy about JRPGs
[06:32:55] <feep> some of it is that ... like, okay, putting aside the aesthetics
[06:33:15] <feep> I think what impresses me about kingdom hearts in particular is that there is very little separation between the *plot* of the story and the *character development* of the story.
[06:33:30] <rmmh> western RPGs tend to be some sort of hero's journey arc
[06:33:45] <feep> adventure stories
[06:34:03] <rmmh> with cyclic narratives kind of driven by the genre stereotypes 
[06:34:29] <rmmh> JRPGs is like they just keep appending entirely different things ?
[06:34:40] <feep> okay, here's an example
[06:34:45] <feep> the way in which skyrim is *not* an jrpg
[06:35:34] <feep> there's a conversation you have with dragonbro, er, paarthurnax, at the throat of the world
[06:36:11] <feep> and he's like ... "maybe alduin is meant to be, like, this is the turning of an age, maybe we should just allow him to devour the world and begin the next cycle"
[06:36:17] <feep> (as is his rightful role in creation)
[06:36:40] <feep> and my favorite answer to that has always been, "yeah okay, but I'm of *this* age - let the next age fight for itself, and I'll fight for this one"
[06:37:00] <rmmh> just another apex predator touting the rightness of the circle of life
[06:37:11] <feep> but -- like, if this was a *jrpg*, I think I'd have more "something to protect" in that scene, right?
[06:37:26] <feep> like, the point is, you can imagine that scene in a rpg maker game
[06:37:47] <feep> and it'd be like ... "love interest A, love interest B, even rival A! I'll protect them, and this whole cycle!"
[06:38:09] <feep> the character motivation and story flows directly from the character's relations
[06:38:15] <feep> which - in skyrim - it *super does not*.
[06:38:29] <feep> you just do things because they are there to be done.
[06:38:38] <rmmh> TES games are real loose with character motivations
[06:38:48] * gwern uploads https://www.gwern.net/docs/ai/2020-devlin.pdf
[06:38:48] <Robomot> PDF (14 pages; 87 KB) - Guys and Dolls (Kate Devlin, Chloé Locatelli) - sexology
[06:38:49] <feep> why do you fight alduin? what do you mean? he has the quest marker.
[06:39:01] <feep> why does your character fight alduin? who the fuck knows? what's a "character"?
[06:39:25] <rmmh> it's kind of inevitable with strongly nonlinear narratives
[06:39:29] <rmmh> open world games
[06:39:38] <feep> disagree!
[06:39:44] <feep> mass effect 2, for instance
[06:39:55] <rmmh> ME2 is not an open world nonlinear adventure lol
[06:40:03] <feep> right but like ... it could easily have been
[06:40:07] <feep> the story structure supports it.
[06:40:16] <feep> and so I think me2 could be a jrpg with relatively few changes.
[06:40:19] <rmmh> does it? you're running around unraveling the mystery
[06:40:28] <feep> rmmh: not really, that's more me1
[06:40:38] <rmmh> unfortunately the mass effect remake leaned far away from JRPG with the remove of ass effect shots
[06:40:40] <feep> me2 is story quest, story quest, bouquet of character quests, story quest
[06:40:47] <rmmh> what is a JRPG without gratuitous fanservice?
[06:41:00] <feep> that structure would work fine in an open world
[06:41:17] <feep> I mean yes, but that's style, I'm talking more about -- actually, I'd bet last of us did really well in japan
[06:41:19] * feep goes check
[06:41:19] <rmmh> I think we can both agree that ME has better writing wrt motivations than TES
[06:41:49] <rmmh> the other thing with a JRPG
[06:41:54] <rmmh> is I never have any fucking clue how close I am to the end
[06:42:02] <rmmh> because the arcs are inscrutably tangled or sequential
[06:42:02] <feep> https://www.4gamer.net/games/117/G011794/20130626070/ yep, it did

[06:42:31] <feep> rmmh: like, I mean, generally when you're fighting the lovecraftian outer god, you're pretty close to the end
[06:42:36] <rmmh> (also, have you read Worth the Candle?)
[06:42:39] <feep> that's a fairly reliable indicator
[06:42:55] <rmmh> some of my favorite fourth-wall-breaking ruminations on narrative
[06:42:58] <feep> rmmh: I'm listening to the podcast
[06:43:05] <feep> it's gonna take a while :P
[06:43:07] <gwern> borges notes somewhere that perhaps the most Western thing ever said was in a letter by Julius Caesar:    'I am not disturbed by the fact that those whom I have released are said to have left the country in order to make war against me once more. Nothing pleases me better than that I should be true to my nature and they to theirs.'
[06:43:07] <rmmh> podcast? is there an audio book?
[06:43:26] <feep> rmmh: the hpmor podcast is doing a wtc let's read

[06:43:50] <feep> IT LIVES.
[06:43:54] <rmmh> what the fuck 2700 posts
[06:43:56] <feep> gwern: yeah but ... that is also an incredibly jrpg thing.
[06:44:12] <feep> gwern: tell me you couldn't see that in fate, word for word.
[06:44:22] <gwern> feep: only as a summoned hero from the West

[06:46:06] <feep> and then I think the rest of the jrpg identity is just the visual style and some typical language artifacts
[06:46:06] * gwern is amused. he looked pretty hard for that quote at least twice before and failed. this time he tried looking at the julius caesar wikiquote page...
[06:47:09] <feep> oh fuck oh god, I want skyrim jrpg now
[06:47:17] <feep> hell, fallout as a jrpg

[06:47:43] <feep> haha
[06:47:49] <feep> no like, fully with the plot structure, cause
[06:47:54] <feep> fallout 4 could *hella* be a jrpg
[06:47:57] <rmmh> god who would install this
[06:48:00] <feep> the convoluted plot is right on brand
[06:48:09] <rmmh> give me some uncanny valley in my fallout
[06:48:57] <feep> like
[06:49:06] <feep> fallout contains a faction called the BROTHERHOOD of STEEL.
[06:49:11] <feep> tell me that does not come straight from a jrpg.
[06:49:20] <rmmh> that's some burning spirit alright
[06:49:29] <feep> like.... take everyone on the prydwin and make them 40% more fuckable
[06:49:44] <feep> no ... 60%!!
[06:50:07] <feep> give them faction *internal* quests! characterize the relations of *every bos character* and *develop them through narrative*
[06:50:33] <feep> it even *sort of* has it with the institute drama! that's great! you could make a great jrpg plot from that
[06:50:41] <feep> the characters just have to actually *interact with it as a concept*
[06:51:13] <rmmh> do we have over/under on when NNs will be used to develop RPGs
[06:51:19] <rmmh> by writing subplots
[06:51:22] <feep> fallout 4 is ... like, fallout 4 has *more environmental storytelling than npc storytelling*.
[06:51:29] <feep> that's just sad.
[06:51:45] <feep> but the setting in itself could 100% support a jrpg.
[06:51:53] <feep> it's just ... missing.
[06:51:57] <rmmh> did you see their new space game?

[06:52:22] <rmmh> coming out nov 2022 (i.e., 2024 maybe)
[06:53:56] <feep> rmmh: as an exercise, and because this video totally supports 
[06:53:58] <feep> it*
[06:54:04] <gwern> https://twitter.com/tszzl/status/1414398108104986627 sadly
[06:54:05] <|dbotdan> roon (@tszzl, 2021-07-12 01:36): ‘the three body problem guy joined as a “scifi director” at an AI startup that sells uyghur recognition programs to the Chinese government lmao’
[06:54:13] <feep> I want you to watch this, and imagine in your head that it is a kingdom hearts cutscene.
[06:54:40] <rmmh> lol
[06:56:25] <feep> rmmh: like. "You're part of Constellation now. Part of our family." Like --- you get a totally different impression if you hear that with jrpg goggles, right?
[06:56:44] <rmmh> Part of our nakama.
[06:57:19] <feep> like, in a western rpg, Constellation is going to be some project or organization. In a japanes-- EXACTLY-- japanese RPG, that's going to be a group of people who all have clearly developed social relations, and whose interactions are going to be in some way the *point of the story*.
[06:57:40] <feep> thing focus vs person focus.
[06:58:05] <feep> yo, you know what series is jrpg as fuck?
[06:58:07] <feep> doctor fucking who.
[06:58:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is that why it makes zero sense
[06:58:23] <feep> yes!!
[06:58:32] <feep> actually, unironically, yes
[06:58:53] <feep> the plot doesn't matter, the character configurations are what matter. that's why the current seasons have shat the bed so hard, too.
[06:59:13] <feep> cause it's suddenly a bethesda rpg, lol.
[06:59:44] <feep> doctor who, at its best, is a jrpg.
[07:00:37] <gwern> so sekaikei is the pure, ultimate distillation of JRPGdom?
[07:00:38] <feep> that's what makes it great, because it's *about* seeing the alien as characters.
[07:00:56] <feep> I don't know that. :p
[07:01:32] <feep> oyeah, the sad thing about the constellation trailer
[07:01:42] <feep> top comment: "Another galactic colony needs our help, I'll mark it on your map."
[07:01:49] <feep> yyyyyyyyyyyep.
[07:02:25] <rmmh> this is a funny distinction
[07:02:34] <rmmh> and I think you might be onto something
[07:02:58] <rmmh> JRPGs as relationship-driven, and WRPGs as organization-driven
[07:03:08] <feep> well, if at all.
[07:03:20] <feep> I'd even go so far and say plot-driven.
[07:03:23] <rmmh> WRPGs tend to follow epic fantasy tropes of 'save the kingdom from apocalypse' etc
[07:03:32] <feep> yeah but the investment is just the gameplay.
[07:04:03] <feep> hey, I bet half-life 2 did really well in japan.
[07:04:07] <gwern> so when I was playing pokemon red/blue and thought it was about getting the badges and defeating the elite 4 to rise to the top of the system, I was reading it as a western rpg. it was really about my (no-homo) love-hate relationship with Gary and how we were pushing each other to be the best we could be
[07:04:26] <feep> gwern: yeah but can you really say pokemon has "the jrpg nature"?
[07:04:38] <gwern> I'm not sure. I am but a baka westerner
[07:04:46] <rmmh> pokemon is a gacharpg
[07:04:53] <feep> the pokemon are the waifus.
[07:05:01] <rmmh> your harem of 6 waifus
[07:05:09] <feep> I mean
[07:05:13] <feep> this but unironically
[07:05:14] <rmmh> and that's how you get pokegirls
[07:05:19] <feep> there's literally a "pokemon likes you" stat
[07:05:26] <feep> and it affects gameplay
[07:05:46] <rmmh> pokemon is just furry princess trainer
[07:05:53] <feep> gwern: so I mean, I think this does have support! like, pokemon join you *because they want to become strong*. you're doing it for them as much as for you.
[07:06:02] <feep> (^ this is canon)
[07:06:15] <rmmh> oh oh I got it feep
[07:06:24] <feep> and like ... there's a reason you can dress them up and decorate their pokeballs. :p
[07:06:53] <rmmh> the JRPG/WRPG tension is actually a deep reflection of collectivism vs individualism
[07:07:18] <feep> rmmh: eh. fallout 4's worst parts were collectivist
[07:07:29] <rmmh> yes, because it forgot that it's a western power fantasy
[07:07:30] <feep> hm ... maybe it's because they were collectivist *bad*
[07:07:38] <feep> yes!! haha that explains everything
[07:07:45] <feep> fallout 4 is a game that *failed at being a jrpg*
[07:07:47] <rmmh> remember, in fallout the commies are definitely evil
[07:07:54] <feep> nope
[07:07:56] <rmmh> sure it's the fuckin apocalypse
[07:08:04] <rmmh> but god forbid someone ties you down
[07:08:13] <gwern> as borges put it: 'We can contrast them with many from Western sources, for example, with that letter in which Caesar says that he has freed his political adversaries, risking their taking up arms again, "because I de sire nothing more than to be as I am and that they be as they are."'
[07:08:16] <feep> rmmh: I mean, hang on, like ... in any jrpg fallout, "the commies are evil" would be questioned as fuck
[07:08:31] <feep> and even in stock fallout, you meet that one chinese ghoul or whatever
[07:08:31] <rmmh> this also explains persona
[07:08:50] <rmmh> and why jrpgs focus so much more on quantified relationships
[07:08:58] <feep> like, there's a story there about propaganda and seeing ------------ YES APROPOS, BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL IS A FUCKING JRPG
[07:09:04] <feep> like, it's just a jrpg
[07:09:23] <gwern> you have to quantify it, because computers just aren't smart enough to do it implicitly... too bad japan stinks at ML
[07:09:41] <feep> gwern: but that's prosocial as fuck! that's the ultimate expression of respect!
[07:09:58] <feep> it's literally caesar saying "I want you to be my enemy forever"
[07:10:09] <feep> that's as good as asking for a date!
[07:10:12] <gwern> japanese julius would be all "oh no, I executed them. and their extended clans."
[07:10:23] <feep> no that's *historic* japanese julius
[07:10:26] <feep> not jrpg julius
[07:10:53] <nshepperd> julius and his kismesis
[07:11:18] <feep> rmmh: yeah, but exactly. fallout is all "go and do things" and it thinks that "why tho" only gets in the way, which ... considering the jrpgy --- augh, augh augh!
[07:11:33] <feep> like, there's so many *elements* in fallout 4 that could form part of a *great* fucking jrpg
[07:11:50] <feep> I cannot let go of the fucking BROTHERHOOD of STEEL.
[07:12:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Your theory doesn't work
[07:12:02] <feep> like, gwern was saying about chuuni earlier
[07:12:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Why? Because SG1.
[07:12:08] <feep> that name is chuuni as fuck
[07:12:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's Western as fuck.
[07:12:21] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: SG1 is as thing-focused as they get.
[07:12:24] <gwern> fine, 'Nakama Of Steel'
[07:12:38] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: SG1 is a good western show, because it *develops characters through the medium of story progression*.
[07:12:38] <gwern> 'Full Metal Brotherhood'
[07:12:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Splitting some hairs here
[07:12:50] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: no!
[07:12:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> yes
[07:13:00] <feep> jack doesn't go through the stargate because he wants to make o'neill proud of him!
[07:13:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> er
[07:13:07] *** Quits: MrFantastik (~Thunderbi@cpe-69-204-101-67.buffalo.res.rr.com) (Quit: MrFantastik)
[07:13:08] <feep> jack goes through the stargate because he's a fucking soldier.
[07:13:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean yes
[07:13:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's true.
[07:14:05] <feep> and like, the true prize of stargate wasn't the friends sg1 became along the way, though that is an excellent prize
[07:14:15] <feep> the true prize is the goa'uld didn't destroy the planet.
[07:14:33] <feep> there is a ranking of priority there.
[07:15:14] <feep> but like ... sg1 in itself isn't, like, compare how sg1 relate to cheyenne mountain to how like ... the characters in metal gear relate to mother base
[07:15:40] <feep> jrpgs sublimate and recreate the family unit in their organizational structure.
[07:15:47] <shawwwn> bah
[07:16:52] <feep> and what really pisses me off about fallout 4 is that it has *all the elements in place to do that exact thing*
[07:16:57] <feep> they're just laying on the ground, unused.

[07:19:16] <rmmh> feep: this also explains why my misanthropic soul finds it hard to care about jrpgs and dramas 
[07:19:45] <feep> right, and why my borderline-autistic self loves the kingdom hearts plot so much
[07:19:52] <rmmh> I wonder if you could link a personality test to preferred media based on the fantasies
[07:19:53] <feep> I *want this power*, lol.
[07:20:19] <rmmh> Or if there's major country variation

[07:21:47] * feep thinks
[07:21:55] <feep> not as jrpgy as it could be, but fairly jrpgy for a western story*

[07:31:15] <rmmh> gwern: it derives from a false folk etymology of 'I have a crush on her'
[07:31:28] <gwern> it may be an extreme form of 'cute agression'
[07:31:51] <rmmh> cute aggression isn't typically visual, though?
[07:32:02] <rmmh> it's *you* wanting to nibble on something that's too cute
[07:33:25] <gwern> but if you watch someone scrunch up an adorable little puppy and its eye bulge a little
[07:34:01] <rmmh> is it ethical to crush kittens to death if you donate the snuff proceeds to a shelter
[07:35:02] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: dunno. T looks right to me
[07:35:19] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: T is 1 when using past
[07:35:43] <shawwwn> so the reshape fails
[07:35:46] <gwern> rmmh: I think shelters are more adopter-constrained than cash-constrained
[07:36:24] <rmmh> hm, sounds right. the problem with pets is excess supply and insufficient demand
[07:36:50] <gwern> you're in a steady-state equilibrium where you can adopt out as many cats as you have adopters, and not more. if you always have at least 1 cat in your pound, that implies you are at your carrying capacity, as it were, in terms of adopters and not money
[07:37:29] <gwern> now, if you ever are like "oh no, the kibble budget this month is just too much! better euthanasize all the excess kittens" and then an adopter walks in and you're like "er... try again next month", then you might be money-constrained
[07:38:04] <rmmh> I suppose more money would allow more cells in a larger no-kill shelters
[07:38:37] <gwern> if you aren't doing that, then additional money letting you hold onto animals much longer (because you buy more facilities) would simply shuffle around animals, I think. maybe a kitten will get adopted out where they would've settled for an adult (and then the adult gets euthanized instead)
[07:39:07] <rmmh> is keeping a cat in a cage for a year before euthanizing it worse than euthanizing it in a month?
[07:39:15] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: this may be best figured out by printing out everything's shape
[07:39:30] <rmmh> like, I'm no big proponent of "pets are evil"
[07:39:47] <rmmh> but animals in shelters are not suffering a fair amount
[07:39:49] <gwern> additional money might let you do stuff like decrease adoption fees, but I can't imagine that would seriously change adoption rates. I didn't even know there were adoption fees when I picked out oolong. (ironically, I turned out to pay no adoption fees because it was the one day a year they waived it as some sort of holiday thing)
[07:39:55] <PlanckWalk> I'd say it's mostly better for the cat.  Even a stressy caged life is probably better than no life.
[07:39:59] <rmmh> err,
[07:40:01] <rmmh> s/not //
[07:40:33] <rmmh> we just need to teach a bunch of cats what suicide is, give them the option of kibble or cyanide, and measure the results
[07:40:42] <gwern> I've mentioned before that dog shortages have reached the point where there are regular large-scale shipments from the South to the North in the USA
[07:41:08] <gwern> need to ship like millions of dogs from southern pounds to northern to make everything balance
[07:41:13] <quanticle> Are we still talking about Noah Smith
[07:41:20] <PlanckWalk> We are now!
[07:41:21] <quanticle> And his wrong opinions?
[07:41:25] <gwern> well, maybe not millions but enough that there are special dedicated 16-wheeler trucks

[07:43:07] <gwern> (I always wondered how many dogs were in there... seemed like you could easily fit hundreds, and the problem is really handling them safely for things like letting them out for food and to poop. sure, most dogs will be fine, but you'll have a tail of dangerous distressed or ill dogs)

[07:43:32] <nshepperd2> relatedly, the way most tensor libraries do transpose is wrong imo
[07:43:54] <rmmh> it's a dog-eat-dog world
[07:43:59] <nshepperd2> instead of foo.transpose(0,3,1,2) which is incomprehensible at a glance
[07:44:13] <galambo__> do you guys recommend subreddits with great images?
[07:44:14] <gwern> (my reasoning was that you could easily stack them 3 high, and 2 wide with an aisle in the middle, and you could definitely get at least 20 long-wise in a 16-wheeler, so that's 3 x 2 x 20 = 120 right there, with plenty of room to go up)
[07:44:18] <galambo__> I like /r/museum
[07:44:27] <nshepperd2> it should be foo.transpose(lambda b,t,h,r: (b,r,t,h))
[07:44:36] <gwern> is that einsum notation or whatever?
[07:45:05] <nshepperd2> well i dunno if you can do it with einsum, but it's just labeling the axes

[07:47:38] <filipepe> hi galambo__ 
[07:47:42] <galambo__> hi
[07:49:24] <nshepperd2> i guess a more einsum like foo.transpose('bthr -> brth') would be better
[07:50:34] <galambo__> filipepe, sorry about your loss to brazil
[07:50:41] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: well, what I don't quite understand is, after you concat past to k and v, what should the output shape be of that block?

[07:50:42] <filipepe> to argentina
[07:50:44] <filipepe> yes
[07:51:03] <filipepe> I didn't even watch it lel
[07:51:05] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: it can't be T, because T is 1
[07:51:12] <shawwwn> so here's a concrete example
[07:51:42] <shawwwn> say you start with "foo bar baz" as the initial context window; suppose it's 3 tokens for simplicity
[07:52:31] <shawwwn> you generate the "presents", aka the past k and v, using logits, presents = model(context)
[07:52:44] *** Quits: ua_ (~ua@public-gprs227485.centertel.pl) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[07:53:00] <shawwwn> so presents has a "T" of size 3, because there were 3 tokens in the context window
[07:53:30] <shawwwn> you generate the next token using random.categorical
[07:53:50] *** Joins: ua_ (~ua@public-gprs227485.centertel.pl)
[07:53:57] <shawwwn> and now you call model(next_token, past=presents) right?

[07:55:23] <quanticle> Also a good choice
[07:55:38] <shawwwn> which starts to make no sense to me

[19:48:05] <dbohdan> Today I remembered the alleged story of a late '90s-early '00s Ukrainian translation of _The Lord of The Rings_.  The translator, a resident of Kyiv, had previously translated LOTR into Russian.  At the time much of the foreign literature available in Ukrainian consisted of quick and lazy English->Russian->Ukrainian translations.  To counteract that, she decided to make her Ukrainian translation of LOTR as distinct from her previous Russian translation 
[19:48:05] <dbohdan> as possible.  Her primary target was the vocabulary.  Where she could, she picked a Ukrainian word that was not used in Russian even if it meant reaching for obscure words.  The result was something that sounded like a regional Ukrainian dialect from no region in particular.  I read the translation like the translator had no doubt written it: with a dictionary.

[20:26:18] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, what? how does your current unemployment benefit matter to them?
[20:26:25] <kuudes> pretty sure they are asking for your gross cost
[20:26:37] <kuudes> ie how many moneys should they budget to your cost center
[20:27:17] <kuudes> they sound a pretty unorthodox employer though. do you have some specific preference to apply to them?
[20:27:32] <kuudes> I would think that there could be easier sources of money than them
[20:27:37] <Gurkenglas> such as?
[20:27:47] <kuudes> normal work
[20:28:08] <Gurkenglas> but this way i can get paid for the stuff i want to do.
[20:28:44] <Gurkenglas> "<kuudes> Gurkenglas, what? how does your current unemployment benefit matter to them?" well if my unemployment didnt exist and the tax rate was 50% they could send me 2000 in order for me to get +1000, while if i get 500 unemployment until i earn 1000 then they can send me 2000 in order for me to get +500.
[20:31:33] <kuudes> no regular employer considers such. I guess ea could be odd enough to consider such but it is odd
[20:32:07] <kuudes> and they can't send you 2000. they need to send you X and then send 2000-X to your tax office
[20:32:16] <kuudes> or pension insurance etc
[20:32:24] <kuudes> mandatory legal insurances etc
[20:32:25] <Gurkenglas> sure, i consider that equivalent.
[20:32:52] <kuudes> that is what they per prior on being a normal employer, are asking you of
[20:34:00] <Gurkenglas> makes sense. does one end up as employed by them or as a random person onto whom money rained out of the cloud?
[20:34:26] <kuudes> no idea. usually the latter is very rare
[20:35:05] <kuudes> if you want just money, how about flipping burgers or writing code?
[20:36:34] <Gurkenglas> that sounds like it would take up my time. if i spend time doing what they pay for, that increases the probability that we make it through the foom.
[20:36:56] <kuudes> which is what?
[20:38:44] <Gurkenglas> i would apply for them to fund their choice of an interpretability tool based on network modularity, a category theory foundation for Scott Garrabrant's finite factored sets, or upscaling my "Would you like me to debug your math?" thing.

[22:00:40] <kuudes> the math does not need to be wrong to reach 0, it just needs to have numerical instability

[22:12:47] <nshepperd2> so i don't think it actually makes sense
[22:13:07] <nshepperd2> i just need to read up on PPO or something
[22:13:56] <kuudes> given bayes, p(a|b) = p(b|a)*p(a)/p(b) <=> ln(p(a|b)) = ln(p(b|a)*p(a)/p(b)) = ln(p(b|a)) + ln(p(a)) - ln(p(b))

[22:18:50] <RiversHaveWings> nshepperd2: i've tried it but it didn't seem to help much
[22:19:12] <RiversHaveWings> well, what i specifically tried was using a contrastive loss value as the Decision Transformer reward
[22:20:01] <RiversHaveWings> its minimum value was 0
[22:20:52] <RiversHaveWings> so it avoided the -inf problem
[22:22:45] <RiversHaveWings> nshepperd2: ...how are you doing this for your model actually
[22:24:01] * nshepperd2 tries to understand https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/04/08/policy-gradient-algorithms.html#off-policy-policy-gradient and figure out if there's any way to abuse this off-policy method to maximize cosim without actually sampling in the training loop
[22:24:01] <Robomot> Policy Gradient Algorithms [Off-Policy Policy Gradient] (Abstract: In this post, we are going to look deep into policy gradient, why it works, and many new policy gradient algorithms proposed in recent years: vanil...)
[22:25:28] <nshepperd2> RiversHaveWings: well, first i did total_loss = model.loss(idx, prompt = embed) - 0.1 * model.loss(idx, prompt = torch.roll(embed)) but that was very dumb and didn't work
[22:25:56] <RiversHaveWings> ...what is that supposed to do
[22:26:49] <nshepperd2> minimize the cross entropy for matching prompts, and maximize it for non-matching prompts
[22:26:52] <RiversHaveWings> oh
[22:27:19] <nshepperd2> which obviously explodes because cross entropy can go arbitrarily high
[22:27:36] <RiversHaveWings> *nods*
[22:28:28] <nshepperd2> then next i tried minimizing the cross entropy wrt negated logits for non-matching prompts, which is stable, but also pretty dubious and seems to have made the cosim worse
[22:28:52] <RiversHaveWings> oh

Boudreaux argues that a perfect storm of factors created a huge overreaction, including unnecessary lockdowns that accomplished little at a very high cost in physical and emotional health. …)
[22:29:23] <kuudes> so is your p(sample|unrelated prompt) that πθ(a|s)/β(a|s) ?
[22:30:11] <kuudes> if so, would the stability improve by using ln(πθ(a|s)) -ln(β(a|s)) instead?
[22:30:17] <nshepperd2> no, that policy gradient thing is a completely different, probably better idea
[22:30:25] <kuudes> ah
[22:30:34] <RiversHaveWings> how do you do policy "gradient" through that many consecutive sampling steps?
[22:32:29] <nshepperd2> not sure
[22:33:31] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[22:35:52] *** Joins: galambo_ (galambo@user/galambo)
[22:36:31] <nshepperd2> i think normally the idea is you sample a trajectory, then do a one-step gradient with that trajectory as input using Q(s,a) which approximates the expected reward at each step of the trajectory
[22:37:04] <RiversHaveWings> oh
[22:37:10] <RiversHaveWings> but there's no reward till the end?
[22:37:34] *** Quits: galambo (galambo@user/galambo) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:37:45] <nshepperd2> Q(s, a) would be like another transformer (with causal masking) which outputs its predicted reward given each possible next token, instead of logits
[22:38:13] * gwern discovers his emacs config is not actually checking yamls for balanced parens/brackets/double-quotes and that there's like 30 errors in custom.yaml rn. in keeping with the law: "any new lint or errorcheck on gwern.net will always expose at least 1 problem"
[22:38:25] <nshepperd2> in this case there's no reward until the end since the reward is just the cosim, but that's fine
[22:38:33] <RiversHaveWings> oh?
[22:41:20] <nshepperd2> the loss function would be something like -predicted_reward(tokens, prompt) * log_softmax(model(tokens, prompt)) i think
[22:41:37] <nshepperd2> given 'tokens' previously sampled from model
[22:42:24] <RiversHaveWings> nshepperd2: oh no, is that REINFORCE
[22:42:44] <nshepperd2> i dunno, is it
[22:43:28] <gwern> https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/alexander-berger-improving-global-health-wellbeing-clear-direct-ways/
[22:43:31] <RiversHaveWings> REINFORCE is reward * -log(p(action))

[22:43:43] <RiversHaveWings> to get a gradient that you descent
[22:43:44] <RiversHaveWings> descend
[22:45:33] <RiversHaveWings> hm
[22:45:42] <RiversHaveWings> and this uses the predicted reward instead?
[22:46:05] <nshepperd2> yes, i think that is the difference
[22:46:16] <nshepperd2> this is more like an actor-critic thing
[22:46:39] *** Joins: delphi (~delphi@64.44.80.45)
[22:49:48] <nshepperd2> and i think that if i factorize predicted_reward(tokens, prompt) = cosim(prompt, predicted_clip_embedding(tokens)) then i can train predicted_clip_embedding on the training dataset quickly instead of on generated samples slowly
