[00:45:55] <alzgh> those are all `map[int]bool`s

[00:48:28] <fizzie> No, you only get to use a single simple statement (like `_, ok := ...`) in the initial part of an if statement. The most straight-forward thing would be to just do those before the `if`.

[01:56:10] <dostoyevsky2> I suppose one might expect that they increase the versinon numbers of libs you want to use properly, so e.g. v2 of a module still would work with go1.17 but the v3 is using generics now... but I guess it depends on how aware the maintainers are

[02:20:06] <llorllale> This looks like one of the few places where the standard lib kinda forces you to declare an interface on the producer side - the DB in this case - in order to narrow down the scope of the API. You definitly do not want to expose connection pool config.

[04:30:27] <fizzie> The way it works is, `switch { /* ... */ }` is just a shorthand for `switch true { /* ... */ }`, so it'll pick the first `case` branch that evaluates to true.

[08:51:42] <sysx1000> rewt: it requires
[08:52:11] <sysx1000> I know about &, but I need to do it with reflect
[08:52:18] <rewt> why?
[08:52:50] <KirkMcDonald> Does this mean that what you have is a reflect.Value?
[08:54:00] <rewt> &Foo{} gives a *Foo ... what did you leave out?
[08:54:04] <sysx1000> KirkMcDonald: yes. val := reflect.ValueOf(i) // ptr := val.Pointer() // ptv := reflect.NewAt(structType, unsafe.Pointer(ptr)) - my idea of this
[08:54:16] <sysx1000> rewt: I need to do it with reflect. not with &
[08:55:08] <sysx1000> KirkMcDonald: it crashes on val.Pointer(), saying 'call of reflect.Value.Pointer on struct Value'
[08:55:30] <KirkMcDonald> Value.Pointer() is what you'd call if the value were, itself, a pointer.
[08:55:45] <sysx1000> in short, I need '&' but done with reflect to any possible struct

[08:56:07] <KirkMcDonald> Value.Addr is a thing.
[08:56:20] <sysx1000> hmm, let me check
[08:56:20] <KirkMcDonald> But note that the value must be addressable.
[08:56:30] <KirkMcDonald> Value.CanAddr checks this.
[08:56:51] <sysx1000> ok, a := Foo{} - does it seems like addressable?
[08:57:03] <KirkMcDonald> Local variables are addressable, yes.
[08:57:11] <sysx1000> okay, great
[08:58:03] <sysx1000> Addr exactly seems to be a thing I require
[08:58:33] <sysx1000> pointing to struct over unsafe pointers was looking pretty confusing to me. Reflect is tricky

[10:00:45] <sysx1000> ok, fixed. it really depends, how structure is stored. seems like when it passed over parameter, it's not addressable. could it be possible?
[10:01:35] <sysx1000> the same behaviour, when struct is returned (not pointer to the struct, but struct itself)
[10:03:27] <KirkMcDonald> Why yes, the way in which it is stored has implications for whether it is addressable.
[10:03:37] <KirkMcDonald> It is very difficult to comment on code we cannot see.
[10:06:21] <sysx1000> anyway, I've got the point and found some ambiguities in the code, so, many thanks everybody for pointing me :)

[16:37:03] <dostoyevsky2> Yeah, Python has OrderedDicts, every language should have them...
[16:37:22] <fizzie> It costs money to keep track of the order, so arguably it's the better default not to, since many use cases don't care.
[16:38:28] <fizzie> Admittedly without generics a package to provide an ordered map isn't quite as convenient as a built-in type.
[16:38:42] <dostoyevsky2> I have these YAML files where the order of the dicts are important but since it all ends up in a map... I can basically write my own yaml parser
[16:40:38] <fizzie> Didn't go-yaml specifically have a type for that already?
[16:41:01] <rawtaz> fizzie: yeah but there are plenty of use cases where you do need it and given expected parameter types you cant really just swap your map for something else
[16:41:24] <rawtaz> (e.g. fields in logrus - theyre logged with thrown around order all the time, and it's a PITA)
[16:43:40] <fizzie> https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/yaml.v2#MapSlice or something. Not *actually* an ordered map, though, just a slice of key-value pairs.
[16:43:51] <dostoyevsky2> fizzie: It has a custom class for keeping track of the ordering but it would have required me to rewrite a lot of my code because you can't define a custom map type using the same syntax as map... so I went with some heuristics and sorting that map when I needed it...

[17:59:58] <fizzie> Looks like one of those things that aren't really following the module versioning stuff. The tag v2.3.1 should have a go.mod file that has a module declaration with a "v2" path.

[18:00:37] <Tykling> fizzie: thank you, that is sort of the conclusion I am arriving at, so the issue is that the pebble packaging hasn't kept up with the modern Go way of doing things?
[18:00:58] *** Joins: alzgh (~alzgh@user/alzgh)
[18:01:05] <fizzie> Think the way you'd build that is to do your own `git clone` + `git checkout <whicever tag>` + `go install ./...` as opposed to trying to use `go get` for the fetch.
[18:01:30] <Tykling> I will try using git instead of go get, much appreciated, thank you!

[18:03:29] *** Joins: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge)
[18:03:48] <fizzie> For some reason seems like a lot of programs (as opposed to libraries) do that thing where they don't use major version suffixes for their module. When you're building/installing "in" the checkout (as in that `go install ./...`) the path of what's called the main module doesn't really matter. But when referring to it "externally", it should be called "github.com/letsencrypt/pebble/v2" in order for
[18:03:50] <fizzie> v2.3.1 to be a valid tag.
[18:05:35] <fizzie> That's probably why you'd be getting v1.0.1 for the go get: it's the most recent version valid for the v1 major version. Using "github.com/letsencrypt/pebble/v2" would pick up the v2.3.1 tag and find the code, but then I think it would complain about the path in go.mod.
[18:07:32] <fizzie> (Yeah, it does.)

[20:49:54] <rawtaz> ok so a cosmetics question; whats your recommendation on using the "shorthand"  if err := viper.ReadInConfig(); err != nil {  instead of splitting that up in first the assignment and then the if statement? just trying to find a good set of practice in my coding..

[20:51:13] <fizzie> resamvi: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/26286 discussed cross-major-version upgrades a little, but I don't think any of that speculative tooling got implemented. The part that would make `list` show a note on available newer major versions sounds eminently doable though.

[22:19:49] <rawtaz> im having a problem. im using Cobra for commands and flags, and also Viper for env vars and also reading a conf file. i have the root command and the run command in package cmd. in the root i have  persistentFlags.StringVar(&rootOptions.ConfigFile, "config-file", "", "`path` to config file")  where rootOptions is a simple struct.

[22:20:44] <rawtaz> now, it seems that its not until i have run the rootCmd.Execute() that the flag's value is set in the rootOptions.ConfigFile. and i need that set, to then use viper to read the given config file.

[22:21:41] <rawtaz> but i dont get where the heck to place the code to make use of that rootOptions.ConfigFile and read the config file using viper. i dont want to do it in the run command, since this is a global thing so should be done earlier, e.g. in the root command where i have the flag defined as well.

[22:26:31] <rawtaz> yeah. in short it seems to run Run() only on the command that was actually the "final" one on the command line, so e.g. if i do `prog run` instead of `prog` it runs the runCmd.Run() and not the rootCmd.Run()

[22:44:41] <rawtaz> i have a vague suspicion that i'm an idiot. trying to verify..
[22:44:58] <b0nn> If I have two types on either side of a software boundary, and both types match each other exactly (except, maybe in name) why can I not pass them interchangeably - it's a compile time check to ensure that they both match and are therefore (in my world) interchangeable
[22:45:52] <b0nn> I mean, I'm trying to take away the dependency that arises when you pass custom types across the boundary
[22:45:55] <rawtaz> no, i wasnt.

[23:16:00] <flughafen> (I work at SUSE) but I'm updating a package. I've already tested it on sles, but I'm having difficulties getting it built for RHEL.  We have to use lots of manual stuff as our suse macros don't work for redhat stuff.

[23:17:55] <b0nn> it's weird that an update would break (implying that previous versions have worked)
[23:18:20] <b0nn> The problem in your error is the cgo build (which you need for DB stuffs)
[23:18:20] <flughafen> We've been bad about  updating. So this is jumping lots of versions.
