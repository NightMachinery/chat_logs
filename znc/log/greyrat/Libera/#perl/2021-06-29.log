[01:43:32] <Grinnz> i mean, yes, you can always loop through things

[01:46:26] <genio> nah, the fun continues with the strawberry bits. I was first doing some stuff on my own to figure things out and understand. I now need to re-do some things to conform to kmx's way and to have things on the right drive, etc. rather than redesigning basics

Then after going, man... I don't want to do this for bash scripts, perl scripts, batch files, etc. etc. I decided just creating a damn z: drive is easy

[20:25:35] <djerius> is there an eili5 for why goto's are slower than sub calls?  Just saw in Throwable's changelog that a goto was replaced by a sub call for performance reasons.  I've always assumed that goto's were faster because @_ could be reused instead of created.
[20:26:46] <Grinnz> djerius: because it has to create and then unwind the new stack frame
[20:27:00] <Grinnz> also, not gotos, but goto &SUBNAME specifically (very different)
[20:27:38] <Grinnz> basically, you want to use these tail calls when it's ok to be slightly slower in order to remove the extra stack frame, either for debugging or recursion reasons
[20:27:45] <thrig> there were a few tailcall modules on CPAN but last I looked they were buggy
[20:27:46] <djerius> Grinnz: sorry, meant goto &SUBNAME.  Haven't used a real goto (except in C code) in years.

[21:44:20] <simcop2387> that and there being no US based DCs for hetzner make it less attractive
[21:45:14] <ilmari> ah, I didn't realise OVH had US DCs
[21:45:24] <ilmari> I always thought of them as european

[21:48:41] <Grinnz> revhippie: that was simcop2387's suggestion :)
[21:49:21] <simcop2387> it also reduces calling cost in the future so that it's basically the same as if it was done natively.
[21:49:46] <revhippie> neat!
[21:49:48] <simcop2387> you pay the overhead of loading when you use it, and only when called the first time so the actual impact is as minimal as possible
[21:50:19] <simcop2387> djerius: nice site for finding places.  will look through it all
[21:50:31] <Grinnz> choroba: that was also part of the jumbo signatures discussion
[21:51:00] <mjgardner> The real code we're using is a little more complicated since it's using Log4perl and the old method wrapper is factored out into a Moose role. But it's the same principle.
[21:51:34] <ilmari> simcop2387: btw, 20TB/month works out as a continuous 60Mb/s
[21:52:03] <simcop2387> yea it's definitely a lot.  i think i remember the most my mirror did was 1-2TB tops
[21:52:30] <simcop2387> it was being used by someone's CI system (genio or gordonfish- or someone with a g name i think)

[22:52:52] <gordonfish-> Most are /dev/sd$x but I have at least two clients that have servers with ide drives
[22:53:02] *** gordonfish- is now known as gordonfish
[22:53:19] <curdlesnoot> the distribution must be ancient then. libata has been the norm for a long time.
[22:53:23] <gordonfish> simcop2387: I'm talkin' pentium 4 based systems mainly
[22:53:49] <simcop2387> yea so scary
[22:53:52] <gordonfish> (so yeah sort of scary but seemingly been good work horses for lower end duties)
[22:54:17] <simcop2387> those are probably sucking down 200W for the same kind of performance you can get on a raspberry pi 4 i'd bet
[22:54:19] <Pali> libata subsystem can handle also IDE disks
[22:54:33] <Pali> no need to use old IDE subsystem for IDE disks
[22:54:43] <gordonfish> One of them started as a RH (classic) 8 or 9 and have been upgraded by hand from what I saw
[22:54:48] <gordonfish> Pali: Yep, "This is about clearing out the legacy IDE code while IDE driver support remains available via the more modern libata-based code in the kernel"
[22:54:57] <thrig> how many of the raspberry pi will be running in 10 or 20 years
[22:55:11] <gordonfish> Letting libata handle that stuff looks like a good idea to me
[22:55:52] <simcop2387> thrig: decent amount i'd imagine probably on par with old p4 systems in a per-capita sense
[22:56:29] <simcop2387> gordonfish: libata always got better performance with pata stuff, mostly because it could queue and reorder stuff going to the disks properly compared to the old ide code
[22:56:39] <gordonfish> thrig: Depends where it's stationed. A friend of mine sent one that was set up in a box on a pole on a beach by the ocean and salt water had managed to seep in over some time and it ended up corroding pretty badly
[22:56:51] <gordonfish> *sent a picture of one
[22:57:24] <gordonfish> simcop2387: Yeah all the more good reason to ditch the old code
[22:57:27] <simcop2387> gordonfish: yea putting one near salt water like that you'd want to take extra care for weather sealing and probably also throw on your own conformal coating
[22:58:20] <gordonfish> simcop2387: He said the enclosure was a "weather proof electronics box" from amazon..
[22:58:44] <simcop2387> yea salt water tends to be worse than weather when it comes to proofing

[23:44:00] <veesh> so i'm starting to look into a full featured tree-sitter parser for perl
[23:44:09] <veesh> and someone started one, but I really don't like his style
[23:44:19] <veesh> is it worth it to start from scratch, or try and build off of his?
[23:49:34] <LeoNerd> The only sensible perl parser is `perl`
[23:50:01] <LeoNerd> so if you're not using perl's own parser, then no it isn't worth it
[23:52:32] <ether> strongly agree
[23:53:47] <pragma-> I'm just hoping the github tree sitter perl plugin gets finished soon so people who browse perl on github can jump between subs and identifiers
[23:55:20] <pragma-> veesh: maybe consider contributing to the existing perl tree sitter library
[23:55:46] <simcop2387> veesh: it might be worth having one written in perl, if i ever get around to making a perl language server that doesn't use coro then i might end up trying to port their work or make my own. 
[23:55:53] <veesh> LeoNerd: i could hook up tree-sitter to use perl to parse perl probably
[23:56:00] <veesh> it lets you use arbitrary C extensions
[23:56:15] <simcop2387> the whole idea being that a tree sitter parser works a lot better for handling partially complete programs and updating the parsing state from changes
[23:56:32] <pragma-> this seems to be the perl tree sitter library in development for github: https://github.com/ganezdragon/tree-sitter-perl

[23:56:37] <veesh> ether: you're the one who got me started on this, mentioning semgrep a week or two ago
[23:56:54] <veesh> ya, but he tokenizes semicolons as a visible token
[23:57:29] <simcop2387> you kinda have to, assuming you want to properly represent perl statements
[23:57:47] <veesh> it wouldn't need to go into the user visible parse tree
[23:57:57] <veesh> i mis-typed, i meant he parses them into a semicolon node
[23:58:59] <simcop2387> i think i'm taking a nap after this work meeting
