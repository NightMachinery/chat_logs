[15:30:23] <sjamaan> Are you on a 32-bit platform?
[15:30:43] <curium> on a 64
[15:33:51] <sjamaan> curium: Ah yeah, I see now. This is a particular case in the compiler for literals
[15:34:16] <sjamaan> You see, literals for fixnums must still be literals for fixnum when compiling your code on a 32-bit platform
[15:34:28] <sjamaan> So the generated C can only effectively deal with 32-bit fixnums

[15:36:59] <sjamaan> Unfortunately, no.  If you compile it in non-fixnum-arithmetic code, it'll be generating an expression that evaluates to an integer, which will be fixnum on 64-bit platforms and bignum on 32-bit platforms
[15:37:26] <sjamaan> If you really must, you could fit it in a foreign declaration, or just use (- (expt 2 32) 1)
[15:39:46] <curium> hm another question then
[15:40:31] <curium> in chicken fixnum it says that instead of using those functions one could use type declarations
[15:40:46] *** Quits: johnjaye (~pi@173.209.64.74) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[15:40:53] <curium> is there a way to check that after giving types, fixnums are being used?
[15:41:25] <sjamaan> You could use -debug o and see if the procedures got optimized
[15:41:33] <curium> fixnum operations are*
[15:41:41] <sjamaan> But you'll never get 100% fixnum ops, because most operations may overflow into bignums
[15:41:54] *** Joins: johnjaye (~pi@173.209.64.74)
[15:42:42] <sjamaan> Even (+ (the fixnum x) (the fixnum y)) will produce a call to C_s_a_u_i_integer_plus
[15:43:04] <sjamaan> Those prefixes are a bit comical
[15:43:25] <curium> and if using fx+?
[15:43:36] <sjamaan> That's 100% certain to return a fixnum
[15:43:37] <curium> fx+ *
