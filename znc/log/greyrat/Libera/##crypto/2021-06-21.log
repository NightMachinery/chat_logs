[00:46:17] <bbear> hi here
[00:46:33] <bbear> I know we don't talk about cryptocurrencies, but here i'm talking about cryptocurrency protocol
[00:46:51] <bbear> I was looking for some sort of python library to derive public address from an extended public key.
[00:46:59] <bbear> for various crypto
[00:47:12] <Wulf> bbear: Hello. What is an "extended public key"?
[00:48:34] <bbear> it's basically a public key that is associated with your private key but derived from it.
[00:49:35] <Wulf> bbear: isn't that true for... all public keys?
[00:49:49] <wasamasa> yeah, it's a rather meaningless term
[00:49:53] <bbear> yes
[00:50:24] <bbear> basically the xpub can derive all the addresses of a bitcoin wallet, each address has money on it and that's it.
[00:50:34] <wasamasa> expect to study the source code of whatever it is you're doing this for
[00:50:37] <bbear> The derivation scheme is part of a protocol
[00:51:06] <bbear> yes indeed if you derive a wrong address, then oops

[01:45:21] <Hash> Old encryption model.
[01:45:29] <Hash> I'm trying to figure out the issue
[01:45:31] <Hash> Where to store keys?
[01:45:42] <Hash> I mean, I can't store priv key on server for any user. that defeats the purpose.
[01:45:50] <Hash> So local storage?
[01:45:58] <Hash> \o/
[01:46:05] <wasamasa> nonono
[01:46:17] <danieldg> browser local storage is no more secure than storing it on the server
[01:46:22] <Hash> See
[01:46:25] <Hash> That's what I mean
[01:46:30] <Hash> Hence the issue. :(
[01:46:38] <Hash> <- sad panda
[01:47:55] <MacGyver> I'd think it's marginally better? Sure the server can steal your key when you run code doing so, but surely that's an improvement over the server having a database with the keys already present?
[01:48:00] <wasamasa> you'd at least protect them with a password-derived key
[01:48:04] <Hash> https://gitlab.com/hashborgir/social/-/blob/master/application/models/Message_model.php
[01:48:22] <Hash> As you can see, right now, I've not called the Encryption class into my messaing or posting on wall models yet
[01:48:31] <Hash> I can' figure out where to put the priv key.
[01:48:42] <Hash> pub goes on server, but priv key. No idea where to put it.
[01:49:17] <Hash> Soon as I figure this out, secure solution, I can run my other models through the encryption model.
[01:49:28] <Hash> Then everythign stored on server/db will be encrypted.
[01:49:36] <Hash> Unless you can think of another solution
[01:49:43] <Hash> Maybe my design is broken?
[01:51:11] <Hash> And the problem is, if they lose their priv key, their goes their entire account/history/everything.
[01:51:20] <Hash> So...
[01:51:30] <Hash> Then the issue is also, how to prevent people form wanting to trade drugs

[08:58:50] <lizzie> I don't know what to do with a phrase like "if I don't like block ciphers."  Do you at least understand why a block cipher gives you something useful that a stream cipher does not, for disk encryption purposes?

[08:59:39] <lizzie> it links a paper which discusses how to construct a block cipher from a stream cipher and a hash.
[09:00:11] <lizzie> shachaf: If you have a stream cipher and a hash that you trust, but don't trust *existing* block ciphers, this might be your answer.  If you somehow fundamentally dislike the concept of a block cipher, then I dunno what to tell you.

[09:22:47] <shachaf> lizzie: I understand why it doesn't -- that's why I'm asking!
[09:23:15] <shachaf> Constructing a block cipher from a stream cipher isn't the worst. Maybe I'd rather construct both of them from a fixed permutation instead, or something.
[09:24:03] <shachaf> But it's more, the idea of a stream cipher is so simple. You just generate a pseudorandom stream and xor. And it's applicable in a lot of situations, so a place like this where it isn't applicable is kind of frustrating, because I'd like something this simple to work everywhere.
[09:25:34] <lizzie> well to me it would seem that the best way to make something simple and make it work everywhere is to use well-analyzed primitives that already have implementations on many platforms :P
[09:26:19] <shachaf> So, for example, the fact we can turn a stream cipher into a block cipher is a good start. It means we can start with a big random stream and use it for this. That's something.
[09:26:38] <shachaf> But maybe there's a way to use the "generate a big random stream" primitive more directly, rather than go through this primitive we don't really care about.
[09:28:12] <shachaf> "just stick to things that already exist" isn't a very satisfying answer. I'm not going to go implement disk encryption tomorrow based on this, I just want to explore the space a bit.
[09:29:24] <lizzie> well, I'm not going to tell you that you shouldn't do original crypto research, but you should be prepared for a long timespan between putting it out there for people to analyze, and expecting people to trust its security.
[09:29:52] <lizzie> Sticking to things that already exist is the *practical* safest answer for someone who builds something *now* and wants to make sure it isn't broken easily
[09:30:18] <shachaf> A while ago my impression is that people were all into weirdo block cipher modes like CBC.
[09:30:35] <shachaf> Now everyone uses CTR mode which is way nicer.
[09:30:37] <lizzie> If that's not your intention, then by all means, try things out...  I will say, whatever you end up building that is optimized for disk encryption, is going to have a lot of things in common with these "block ciphers" you seem to dislike

[09:31:03] <lizzie> so I think asking yourself *why* you dislike block ciphers would be interesting, because if you have a specific answer, you might find existing block cipher designs that are more to your tastes
[09:31:23] <shachaf> Good! If you have a theorem of the form "anything you use for disk encryption must satisfy properties X and Y that are shared with block ciphers", that would be a great answer.

[09:32:28] <shachaf> I don't even know offhand exactly what people do and don't want for disk encryption. The property that if you take two snapshots of the disk you can xor them together to get the differences seems pretty bad. Malleability seems pretty bad. Many disk encryption modes solve this partially but not completely.
[09:32:53] <lizzie> Yeah, basically, that.  One of the hardest things about good disk encryption security is that, ideally, you want it to be as resistant as possible to repeated examinations of the same drive revealing information about the usage patterns
[09:33:22] <shachaf> Well, no problem: Just add an IV, and it's instantly perfectly proof against those things.
[09:33:27] <lizzie> which is antithetical to the operating system's goal of minimizing i/o cost and not moving data around more than needed, as well as in most cases, an SSD's goal of not wearing out and dying
[09:33:32] <shachaf> The other constraint is that you don't want to add any extra storage.
[09:34:11] <lizzie> but with a stream cipher in particular, you have no security against that...  if you ever change anything, they can get the xor of your old data and your new data
[09:34:29] <lizzie> "they" meaning an attacker who has gotten snapshots of your drive at different times.
[09:34:42] <shachaf> Storage and I/O operations, I should say.
[09:35:04] <lizzie> Also, yes, what you just said.  All disk encryption formats I've seen seem extremely hesitant to use even a slightest percentage of the storage on crypto metadata.
[09:35:08] *** Joins: x88x88x (~x88x88x@188.214.106.84)
[09:35:42] <lizzie> My personal opinion is that it would be worth it to use disk encryption that authenticates data.  There are other things you can do, like use a filesystem like zfs that authenticates data.
[09:35:56] <shachaf> Yes, I know these things, which is why I brought them up. That's what makes disk encryption such an unusual environment.
[09:36:35] <shachaf> There are some other things you might do, if you're really going for disk encryption specifically: For example, maybe a typical block cipher's block size is way too small, and you really care about a disk's block size instead.
[09:36:37] <lizzie> But basically, chunking the data into clusters that are small enough to not hurt i/o performance "too much" when doing many small writes (and yes, that's a nebulous concept and depends on workload, and this will always have an i/o cost) ends up being the natural solution
[09:36:58] <lizzie> to avoiding the most severe data disclosure risks from repeated peeks at the same encrypted drive
[09:37:53] <lizzie> Now that I think about it...  if you were happy to write metadata, you could have a crypto filesystem that writes arbitrary-sized data segments using a stream cipher, as long as you use independent keys for each segment
[09:38:15] <lizzie> you should be able to use your stream cipher without issues, as long as you are not reusing its keys and you also authenticate all data
[09:38:19] <shachaf> Independent keys or just IVs.
[09:38:46] <lizzie> whatever is still widely believed to be safe for the stream cipher you're using.
[09:38:47] <shachaf> But then you need to rewrite the entire segment when you change any part of it, or something.
[09:39:34] <lizzie> there are certain types of filesystems, like log-structured filesystems, that lend themselves well to write-only data segments that are thrown out wholesale and replaced rather than rewritten in place
[09:40:27] <shachaf> Yes, this is also a thing I was talking to my friend about. If you're OK with only supporting write and append, then you can do this kind of thing.
[09:40:53] <shachaf> Or even if your filesystem is directly encrypted, rather than indirectly going through an old-fashioned block interface.
[09:41:38] <shachaf> It's especially silly these days -- you go through a flash translation layer that already secretly deals with things this way, then you have a gratuitous block interface on top, and a file system on top of that.
[09:42:17] <shachaf> So maybe it'd be best for block devices to just go away in many cases.
[09:42:45] <shachaf> But that's a different question.
[09:42:47] <lizzie> do you mean having the OS directly manage the flash memory?
[09:44:15] <shachaf> Sure, or the flash drive exposing a more modern interface.

[09:45:06] <lizzie> It would be nice to have the linux kernel deal with flash memory at the same time as crypto, for many performance and security reasons...  I would feel much less comfortable trusting buggy proprietary firmwares from various manufacturers to do all that
[09:46:32] <lizzie> for the same reason I already don't use the drive encryption that comes standard on most newish drives
[09:49:47] <lizzie> well apparently linux already ships several log-structured filesystems and most of them actually seem to be designed for their wear-leveling effect on raw flash media

[10:02:10] <Alipha> What I mean by that is that any change to the sector produces completely different ciphertext. Which means any modification to the ciphertext will result in the plaintext being complete garbage. And so, while Adiantum is not authenticated nor uses IVs, it doesn't really need them
[10:03:23] <shachaf> That sounds pretty good.
[10:03:42] <Alipha> And the bulk of the encryption is done with a stream cipher ;-)
[10:03:43] <shachaf> What degree of "doesn't really need them"? Presumably you still want to use them in most cases where you use them now?
[10:04:24] <yawkat> "doesn't need authentication" is maybe a bit much. But it's about as good as it gets with zero size overhead
[10:05:04] <Alipha> Well, Adiantum is for where the ciphertext must be the same size as the plaintext. If the ciphertext can be larger, then sure, add an IV and MAC
[10:05:04] <int-e> the best an attacker can hope achieve is to replace meaningful data by garbage
[10:05:39] <int-e> this is much better than 'xor the right bit with 1 to change a "0" into a "1"' from a stream cipher.
[10:07:28] <int-e> s/xor with 1/flip/
[10:07:49] <Alipha> An IV would prevent an attacker from observing that a sector's data changed back to a previous plaintext. And a MAC would catch alterations to the ciphertext, whereas without a MAC, you wouldn't know if the random gibberish plaintext was actually what's supposed to be there or not
[10:08:47] <Alipha> Neither of which seem like big security concerns

[11:07:25] <wasamasa> I recalls recent LUKS supporting nonces, but it's all beta
[11:08:14] <wasamasa> on the XTS topic: https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2014/04/30/you-dont-want-xts/
[11:09:07] <wasamasa> > You can’t authenticate the data. Authenticating every sector is too expensive. Try to (painfully) authenticate the whole disk and any disk error trashes the disk. Maybe your users enjoy exciting games of chance? Authenticate arbitrary groups of sectors and you can play Russian Roulette with your files.
[11:09:23] <wasamasa> that might be why it's in beta, with the obligatory backup advice
