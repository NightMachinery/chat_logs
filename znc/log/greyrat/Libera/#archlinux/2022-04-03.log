[02:14:36] <BrainDamage> zathura despite its popularity has a huge fatal flaw in handling documents: if they have uneven size the zoom and pagination is completely screwed

[02:14:52] <BrainDamage> it ends up padding each page to the largest size
[02:15:00] <MrElendig> they are going intigrated wifi like intel has

[02:28:28] <sudoforge> so the dgpu is really only maybe going to be useful for photo/video editing, but the 12th gen igpu will likely be fine enough for that too
[02:29:10] <topcat001> I use nvidia-xrun for < Turing, native prime offloading otherwise.

[05:11:09] <mpan> They may be using perfectly well implemented AES. What’s the difference, if they are in control of the encryption process, you are explicitly excluded from being in control, and you give them both the data and the key?

[05:11:20] <vulpine> anchors (where the private key usually is stored) are not sent as part of http requests, assuming you trust that the js was not modified to leak the key to the server, they cant decrypt it
[05:11:40] <mpan> vulpine: but you can’t trust that.
[05:12:11] <mpan> You would need to be in control of the execution environment for that. You are not. The adversary is.

[05:13:28] <mpan> vulpine: ok, can you now convey me the decrypted message? The key to the encrypted message is “NR9y4Jh56N”.
[05:13:56] <vulpine> as 0bin.net puts it, "The goal of 0bin is not to protect the user and their data (including, obviously, their secrets).  Instead, it aims to protect the host from being sued for the content users pasted on the pastebin." 
[05:14:03] <drathir_tor> vulpine: some services allegedly generate at browser side links to paste and sending only encrypted data to servers...
[05:14:51] <rcf> drathir_tor: not even that, given perfectly-intact implementation AES can be notoriously difficult to use in a secure manner as far as ciphers go. 
[05:15:01] <mpan> drathir_tor: but you can’t verify that, because you are not in control. You give the adversary execution environment on your computer, in which they can do anything they wish outside of your control (in practical terms), and claim they secure your data. :)
[05:15:18] <rcf> People suck at adapting block ciphers to arbitrary data, in other words.

[05:18:58] <mpan> drathir_tor: in-browser encryption for file uploads gives minimal protection against third party gaining unauthorized access to running systems of the file hoster and reading that data. Yes, that protection is given, assuming the hoster is actually doing their job. But for end-to-end encryption simply encrypt locally and upload that. If you need to communicate with less computer savvy users, use 7zip.

[05:21:44] <mpan> And TBH I use 7zip for anyone, except for the most sensitive data. The effort to manually `openssl enc` archives is not worth it. Some nerds are whining “omfg, 7z! 7z! WHYY”, but then they become silent having to execute some openssl pipelines.

[05:22:27] <mpan> I do not use 7zip for most sensitive data only because the author has released some bad smell in the past regarding security attitude. But otherwise I find it perfectly fine for most users.
[05:23:01] <sudoforge> mpan: why not encrypt it first, and then 7z? :)
[05:23:41] <sudoforge> am i going to hate dell's keyboard travel after using thinkpads for a few years?
[05:23:45] <sudoforge> i'm pretty sure i will
[05:23:49] <mpan> sudoforge: because 1) encrypted data already has high symbol-to-symbol entropy, making it icompressible with common algorithms found in 7z; 2) it defeats the purpose of using 7z in the first place.
[05:23:51] <drathir_tor> mpan: 7z isnt bad and using separate channels for data and password always increase a bit security by made its harder to compromise both transmission channels...

[06:50:39] <jensen> noob to git. i modified some of the official PKGBUILDs from `asp checkout`. should i create a new branch and `asp update && git pull --rebase origin` to merge changes from the official PKGBUILD or create my own repository for each modified PKGBUILD and periodically vimdiff the PKGBUILDs and manually merge myself? I assume that's how you do it for AUR packages so the process is the same. Or is
[06:50:41] <jensen> there a more organized method that doesn't need a repo for just an PKGBUILD for each package if that's something a bad thing?

[06:53:01] <DeepDayze> originally had a dual core

[06:53:13] <sudoforge> can't really figure it out

[13:20:10] <mpan> IIRC it will not, if you already had the other package installed earlier.
[13:20:30] <mpan> (the other = the replacing one)
[13:21:04] <mpan> Earlier I thought that perhaps you still see version …-1, as …-2 has been released only today.
[13:21:13] <moviuro> what's the rationale behind this decision? wireless-regdb now replaces and provides crda, pacman(8) really should suggest I remove crda

[13:22:40] <sheep> wireless-regdb has replaces=('crda') and provides=('crda') so it should try to replace it
[13:22:41] <nl6720> why does https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/crda/ even exist if it's been replaced? 
[13:22:42] <phrik> Title: Arch Linux - crda 4.14-4 (x86_64) (at archlinux.org)
[13:22:54] <mpan> I can not answer that question. But I do not see that a natural expectation either: no installation of a new package is needed to replace the other. It was already installed. Perhaps diagnostics could be more obvious in case of an error, but that would also mean a more convoluted logic.
[13:23:12] <moviuro> it didn't even cross my mind that pacman would "hide" that info from me when running -Syu
[13:23:13] <mpan> sheep: … if wireless-regdb has been installed alongside crda before that?
[13:23:39] <moviuro> thanks mpan anyway, removing crda now solved my problem
[13:23:41] <mpan> moviuro: no, it does not hide anything from you. It’s just not the scenario you are thinking about, merely because you encountered that situation in that scenario.

[15:44:51] <airmailsteam> aah so it means, there has to be some sort of x application running for xkill to even initialise
[15:45:41] <michelesr> xkill uses X, so it requires an X server, your Wayland compositor should start XWayland automatically when necessary
[15:46:10] <michelesr> but xkill will only work with X windows, not Wayland windows 
[15:46:22] <airmailsteam> yeah, makes sense, so I guess if xkill doesn't work, that in itself is a sign that there is no xwayland application runnung currently
[15:46:41] <michelesr> same as xeyes, that will only look at X windows, and ignore Wayland windows 
[15:48:14] <michelesr> not sure about KDE, but in Sway, if I kill XWayland and then run xkill, it restarts XWayland 
[15:48:25] <michelesr> so I get to choose the window
[15:49:15] <michelesr> use something like htop to check whether XWayland is running, and check if DISPLAY is set correctly

This happens even if I start iptables with systemd with a custom ruleset that does not contain this rule. Does anyone have any idea how to fix it and why it happens?

[16:13:43] <MrElendig> sounds like you enabled the killswitch
[16:13:51] <michelesr> killswitch is supposed to prevent any request to reach the internet when vpn is off, so I suppose so

[16:14:19] <drathir_tor> xy0: in meaning seems like killswitch working...
[16:14:39] <MrElendig> that is the whole point of the killswitch
[16:14:47] <xy0> I just thought it'd kill all networking binaries if the connection is cut and if I start eg the webbrowser without vpn active it would just work
[16:15:31] <xy0> okay but thank you very much! I guess the "problem" is now solved
[16:15:51] <michelesr> well, did you try to take the killswitch off and see if it removes the rule? 
[16:16:39] <michelesr> also, not 100% sure, but I think sometimes rules or chains are named so that they give you an indication of who created them?

[19:54:32] <bud> i have one issue that has been bugging me since i got this computer. Its a laptop (x270) and i mostly use it in a docking station, with only external DVI connected monitor.
[19:55:24] <bud> There is a BIOS setting that i have enabled that make it prioritize the external monitor if it is docked. This means, that on boot, it doesn't even turn on the laptop monitor.
[19:55:31] <bud> and that is how i want it.
[19:56:00] <bud> i have encrypted boot, and after i unlock it and it loads the kernel

[19:56:47] <bud> it starts toggling on and off the monitors, and i think when i reach login both are on, in "cloned" view.
[19:57:32] <bud> i have a dirt-hack script that just turns off the laptop monitor with xrandr after login, but it would be so nice to have it not turn it on in the first place.

[19:58:43] <bud> the most annoying part of this, is that when it toggles the monitors, my external monitor shows this notification "DVI monitor connected" or something (this notification comes from monitor firmware).
[19:59:01] <bud> and the notification is positioned exactly on the location for the login prompt.
[20:00:16] <bud> so question: where do i look to sort this out? GRUB? Custom kernel hook thing?
