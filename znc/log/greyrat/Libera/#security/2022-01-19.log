[01:18:11] <bn_work> hi, https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/ claims CVE-2022-23307 is "critical", but looking at https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23307 it still doesn't have a score.  CVE-2022-23307 refs https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9493 which _does_ have a score of 9.8 but that is for Chainsaw app itself (which I'm assuming one has to run), so is CVE-2022-23307 just FUD?  AFAICT, Chainsaw is a log viewing *user application*
[01:18:11] <bn_work> (https://logging.apache.org/chainsaw/2.x/) at least v2 is.  CVE claims v1 [1] was bundled in log4j 1.2, however if it's not invoked, how is it a "critical" issue?  wouldn't that require server access a-priori?  [1]  can't seem to find a page that has "v1" archived anywhere (even going back to 2007 https://web.archive.org/web/20071013153933/logging.apache.org/chainsaw/)

[01:35:45] <Evolver> > Log4j includes a SocketServer that accepts serialized log events and deserializes them without verifying whether the objects are allowed or not. This can provide an attack vector that can be expoited.
[01:36:04] <Evolver> If deserialization adds any risk at all, that's bad in itself.
[01:36:28] <Evolver> Why it's producing "objects" instead of messages, idk.

[02:52:39] <SymbioticFemale> i need to set up some graphical output that will show all active outgoing TCP/UDP in real time as well as all disk interactions in real time. this would greatly increase my #security.
[02:53:11] * ajak can't tell if troll
[02:53:32] <ajak> ok so, why do you think so?
[02:54:35] <SymbioticFemale> i think it would give me a constant reminder (1) and it would also help me to identify activity that i would otherwise be unaware of (2)
[02:55:33] <SymbioticFemale> like for example, yesterday i was helping someone install macos in a virtual machine and while installing it was making huge amounts of unexplained network traffic.
[02:55:58] *** Joins: UPXTcgv7 (~KTC2gV3Y@74.5.131.75)
[02:56:07] <ajak> you mean it wasn't explained by your installing macos?
[02:56:12] <SymbioticFemale> right
[02:56:17] <SymbioticFemale> no
[02:56:56] <ajak> i guess what you want is to be wireshark
[02:57:01] <ajak> to be running wireshark
[02:57:02] <SymbioticFemale> i mean, usually when installing an OS, you don't assume it's going to make extensive connections to external servers without explaining, especially considering that you have the full installation image and network connectivity is not a prerequisit for installation
[02:57:47] <ajak> i would expect something like macos to be talking to apple even during installation, even if it could do without it
[02:57:59] <SymbioticFemale> something like wireshark but with constant terminal output rather than graphical, and i want the hard drive access too
[02:58:01] <ajak> you could have just disconnected the vm's network i imagine
[02:58:26] <SymbioticFemale> ajak: correct, and correct. it actually used what appeared to be many many GB of data.
[02:58:42] <ajak> so very likely just updating on the fly
[02:59:06] <SymbioticFemale> likely
[02:59:33] <ajak> if you want a text dump of network traffic you want tcpdump
[03:00:42] <SymbioticFemale> know any equivalent for HD access? i recall years ago when using windows that this was child's play using taskmanager

[04:13:52] <SymbioticFemale> i;m going to migrate to pass in the future, probably. it's written by jason donenfeld, who wrote wireguard. he writes good stuff and keeps things simple.
[04:14:14] <ajak> i wouldn't put a pass db in github even if it's encrypted, but pass is what i ues
[04:14:34] <Hydragyrum> the primary thing if you've got passwords on paper is having it somewhere where some random person poking around won't see them -- in a safe is better ofc
[04:15:07] <writeback[m]> if you really have concerns just get one of those hardware auth keys

[07:49:40] <ska> Is there any inherent benefit of using an NFT over an ecrypted version of an media in order to assert ownership?
[07:50:33] <ska> Seems like the blockchains are cornering the market without any intrinsic benefit over plain encryption/manifest_metadata.
[07:51:27] <ska> If you sell the artwork, just update the manifest, get a digital notary, and re-encrypt.. Simple and easy.
[07:51:42] <ska> And reliabl.e
[07:51:53] <Hydragyrum> but NFTs are BLOCKCHAIN
[07:52:07] <Hydragyrum> buzzwords go a long way
[07:52:35] <ska> Ok, lets call it something else: Digital Protection Juju.
[07:53:23] <Affliction> ska: The artwork needs to be decrypted to be seen, at that point all bets are off
[07:53:52] <Affliction> The same problem every DRM system ever has
[07:53:57] <Hydragyrum> blockchain, crypto, etc. are all buzzwords these days, you can't just get your own buzzwords and hope to have the same impact
[07:54:03] <ska> Lets assume the owner can decrypt and display it in his home. Lower-quality versions can be show in public etc.

[07:55:42] <Affliction> an abstract concept of ownership (the token) of an abstract representation (the hash) of the art (the bytes).
[07:55:54] <ska> Im sorry, but it just doens't make sense to my brain.
[07:56:23] <EdFletcher> now you're getting it
[07:56:36] <Affliction> It sounds like you're at the same level of understanding I am :)
[07:57:12] <ska> Its also really hard for normal artists to deal with NFT bullsh**, complexity, cost, contracting, headache!!!!
[07:57:19] <EdFletcher> if it sounds ridiculous, looks ridiculous and all proponents act ridiculously... it's probably ridiculous 😆
[07:57:21] <Affliction> And the token contains a link. If that server goes down, or replaces all images with goatse...
[07:57:28] <EdFletcher> ^this is the best part
[07:57:32] <MadCamel> It doesn't have to make sense. People with too much money started buying them in order to signal wealth to their peers. Now it's a thing. It'll pass eventually.

[07:58:35] <ska> If you have ever seen the total *crap* they are calling art (not all of it), you'd cry.
[07:58:39] <EdFletcher> it's a pyramid scheme, so the only way for those who got in early to make positive returns is to sucker others into it underneath them, and push more capital into the system
[07:58:56] <Affliction> That's the word I was looking for!
[07:59:06] <ska> which ?
[07:59:10] <Affliction> Pyramid scheme
[07:59:20] <EdFletcher> oh it's not art at all, it's procedurally generated crap. you can write something to generate NFTs in 10 minutes with p5.js FFS
[07:59:40] <ska> This leaves real artists SOL for the most part.
[07:59:50] <EdFletcher> sadly, indeed
[07:59:52] <labrador> ska, wouldn't a simple gpg sign be proof of ownership?
[08:00:01] <labrador> Better than what the nfts are doing anyway
[08:00:09] <Affliction> author gpg signs a message saying "I gave this to X"
[08:00:14] <Affliction> then X can sign a message "I gave this to Y"
[08:00:16] <Affliction> sure
[08:00:17] <labrador> yeah

[08:01:38] <Affliction> ANd I'd say most people trading NFTs probably don't authenticate them properly anyway.
[08:01:44] <Affliction> There's tonnes of fake tokens out there
[08:02:30] <labrador> Affliction, yeah. Because these images would be non fungible as well. You cannot change stuff and make it check out with gpg.
[08:03:53] <Affliction> The GPG equivalent to forgery would be signing the image yourself claiming to be the author, and the recepient not validating that
[08:04:12] <Affliction> The cryptography works, but the human isn't validating it
[08:04:19] <labrador> Yeah well thats right
[08:04:21] <Affliction> Though I'd expect most GPG users wouldn't make that mistake
[08:04:48] <ska> Why not just take an SHA256 of the original and paste that into the manifest.?
[08:05:17] <labrador> Yeah its kindof their way of functioning to verify a key before use,can't say that about nft buyers.

[08:07:02] <ska> Or distribute the manifest to mutliple "curators" .
[08:07:12] <ska> labrador: age encryption, its relatively new.
[08:07:16] <labrador> oh
[08:07:27] <ska> But its very promising.
[08:07:50] <EdFletcher> You’d probably want an HMAC to provide authentication instead of a bare hash but yeah overall that’d work
[08:08:28] <Affliction> ska │ Why not just take an SHA256 of the original and paste that into the manifest.? <- Not sure I follow. I was talking about makign a completely fake manifest that claims to be the original, because people aren't validating it.
[08:08:44] <Affliction> So, sure, the image owuld have the same hash in each manifest
[08:09:12] <Affliction> or, if we're distributing a package with the image itself, and the metadata, signed with the author's key
[08:09:25] <Affliction> the equivalent would be, stropping off that signature, leaving the rest intact, and adding your own
[08:09:39] <Affliction> Because, nft traders often don't validate it anyway
[08:09:54] <Affliction> Yeah, it's an interesting "industry"
[08:10:06] <EdFletcher> LOL it really is
[08:10:11] <ska> Affliction: sure, always a work around. If 7 different "curators" have the original manifest maybe its harder to forge.
[08:10:12] <labrador> Yeah the best things in nft they don't care about
[08:10:28] <labrador> They literally couldn't care less about the crypto
[08:10:48] <Affliction> ska: kind of what the blockchain achieves, everyone can see the transactions going all the way back to the author
[08:11:26] <EdFletcher> labrador: A lot of them have no idea what the prefix “crypto” even stands for! 🤦‍♂️
[08:11:30] <Affliction> But I could copy the image, make a token with myself as the author, sell it impersonating the real author
[08:11:46] <Affliction> Sure, some people will validate it, but it seems most probably wouldn't
[08:12:37] <Affliction> "crypto" without the cryptography is interesting heh
[08:12:54] <ska> What if the original author keeps a record of sha512/hmac, and a decryption key for the same image?
