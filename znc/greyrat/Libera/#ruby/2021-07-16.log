[15:18:17] <rapha> hi all
[15:19:18] <rapha> when nokogiri's #to_xml outputs "xmlEscapeEntities : char out of range", is there a way to get it to tell you _which_ of the potentially hundreds of thousands of chars in the written document was out of range?
[15:43:29] <Cork> rapha: simplest is prob to check what .encoding you have on the different strings you add to the document
[15:43:52] <Cork> cause one of them is prob in a none compatible encoding

[17:39:01] <Cork> that is separate from the strings you use with it

[19:44:15] <rapha> Cork: its default is utf-8, which is the correct encoding, and which i didn't change. the strings also identify as utf-8. but as you say, strings are nothing but sequences of numbers. either a number means something or it doesn't. what i'm suspecting is that one of the strings mostly consists of numbers that do mean something in the context of utf8, except for at least one, which doesn't.
