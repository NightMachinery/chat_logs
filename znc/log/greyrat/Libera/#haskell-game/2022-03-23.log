[00:08:16] <icrbow[m]> <f-a> "what is the most sensible..." <- cartesian-closed category?
[00:10:43] <ManofLetters[m]> I think at least 2-category with cartesian-closed structure for each 1-morphism, to represent translations and re-skinning
[00:12:10] <f-a> is this a joke at my expenses or a truthful suggestion?
[00:12:13] * f-a searches hackage
[00:13:57] <ManofLetters[m]> I'm innocent, I'm just amplifying what ic.rbow says
[00:14:26] <ManofLetters[m]> categories are graphs and graphs are categories, so it's surely work :)
[00:14:33] <ManofLetters[m]> *it'd
[00:31:04] <f-a> icrbow[m]: out of curiosity, what would terminal/Ã—/exp buy me https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_closed_category#Definition ?
[00:38:34] <ManofLetters[m]> terminal is obviously GameOver, assuming you have only one way to lose
[00:38:43] <ManofLetters[m]> and that you can lose from any state
[00:38:45] <ManofLetters[m]> e.g., by quitting
[00:39:00] <icrbow[m]> it's a joke, sorry...
[00:39:00] <icrbow[m]> > in that their internal language is the simply typed lambda calculus.
[00:39:00] <icrbow[m]> basically "represent them with functional programming"
[00:43:57] <icrbow[m]> OTOH, https://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs
[00:44:02] <f-a> ohhh
[00:45:10] <icrbow[m]> esp. https://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs-0.6/docs/Algebra-Graph-Labelled-Example-Network.html
[00:46:15] <f-a> nice
[00:49:14] <icrbow[m]> https://nobrakal.github.io/alga-tutorial/
[00:51:44] <f-a> amazing/II
[00:57:25] <f-a> I think I will use that

[20:18:22] <SridharRatnakuma> Just found it. https://gitlab.com/dpwiz/haskell-game.dev
[20:18:22] <SridharRatnakuma> Good to see another Emanote user ðŸ™‚
[20:18:40] <SridharRatnakuma> There are some broken links (and tag queries) on the published site that needs fixing.
