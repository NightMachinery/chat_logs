[02:25:01] <TheGuestMovie> I've just rewritten something that was a clever 200 line function that relied on personal knowledge of complex systems, into a more naive/brute force approach with 500 lines, because the 500 line version was easier to follow, was flatter, etc

[02:25:57] <TheGuestMovie> even though I wrote the 200 line version, I felt I had to, to be a good (in the moral sense) developer
[02:26:10] <hentai> ayecee, Most likely, but just wanted to confirm :)
[02:26:15] <ayecee> :)
[02:26:53] <ayecee> i would think people like working with optimized code if it's code that they optimized
[02:27:14] <ayecee> but someone else's heavily optimized code, not so much
[02:27:17] <TheGuestMovie> I recommend anyone working as a software developer read Clean Code. It's accessible to anyone, even beginners.

[02:28:32] <VMGuy23> Why would a GCC process be put into disk sleep? I am installing something and it's using up all the ram but is often in disk sleep mode

[02:28:49] <keir> that's categorically untrue
[02:29:13] <ayecee> VMGuy23: what does disk sleep mode mean here
[02:29:23] <TheGuestMovie> I guess "Clean" has a different meaning depending on the person. By clean code I mean easy-to-maintain code.
[02:29:29] <VMGuy23> ayecee: a D in the state column of htop
[02:29:49] <keir> TheGuestMovie: yes and something can be easy-to-maintain and well-optimised
[02:29:54] <ayecee> VMGuy23: that would mean it's reading or writing something to disk, and waiting for that to complete.
[02:29:58] <keir> just requires forward planning

[02:31:10] <ayecee> VMGuy23: right, it wakes up on its own when the read or write completes.
[02:31:13] <TheGuestMovie> yeah, rarely, not in general. It's 2 different attributes and you choose which one to prioritize. Optimized code can mean shorter but less readable code, longer (and therefore less readable code), etc
[02:31:26] <TheGuestMovie> and you can try to find a balance

[02:35:04] <keir> it's hard to strike a balance between writing well-documented code and iterating
[02:35:35] <keir> sometimes making it well-written gets in the way of your iterating thought process
[02:35:44] <TJ-> clean code is usually self-documenting in the main, and only needs additional code to explain the context or gotchyas

[16:16:04] <hexnewbie> __monty__: Ventoy usually makes such job a lot easier, although it mostly supports usual ISOs, not e.g. home-grown ISOs. Though your task may be better accomplish by a *single* distro being *installed* on the stick, with multiple desktop environments to show if that's the task

[16:22:33] <hexnewbie> imakestuff: I always thought Linux was the kernel of choice on ARM machines. But Apple M1 is not a typical ARM machine, and ARM is not the usual architecture for a server, so your mileage may vary.

[17:39:31] <webchat37> tangy not sure , but `find` assumes all hidden files are starting with a dot so it doesn't show me those other files in the results

[18:29:45] <hexnewbie> DPA: It's too early, pcmC2D0p gets plugged later. But you can create an udev rule that waits for the playback devices

[18:33:11] <DPA> Khaytsus: I may not always want the same audio to go to all devices. And with that script which calls it automatically, I don't really have to do much myself. And connecting something to all outputs has become just a regex in qjackctl. So I think it's pretty straight forward.

[19:08:23] <ayecee> gladys: the cpu uses a table of interrupt handlers. the kernel puts its own interrupt handler address in there, and drivers in turn register their handlers with the kernel. when an interrupt occurs, the cpu saves its registers and jumps to the address in the table, the kernel's handler does some housekeeping, and then calls the handler(s) registered with it.

[22:11:14] <PaulFertser> galacticbeat: snowden leaks show it's not always the case. Also, if there's a backdoor it can be eventually discovered and used by third parties.
[22:11:26] <Hash> 01:37 <Peng> If you have any add_header directives in a context, it ignores any in outer contexts, even if they're for different headers

[23:10:16] <raz_> In this argument, a file means a regular file that is stored and contains data. procfs is not that.
[23:10:34] <kurahaupo> I think one needs to be quite careful how one defines words like "file", because a storage object need not live on a disk. It could be assembled on the fly from components (like unionfs) or exist on the other end of a network link (nfs, cfs), or on unwritable media (CD, DVD)

[23:11:06] <raz_> kurahaupo: that is getting out of context, he is trying to find out mtimes and compute checksums of procfs files ....
[23:11:07] <hexnewbie> procfs also does not follow POSIX on how a filesystem should act, having extra features like inotify goes way beyond that (even NFS can't do inotify)
[23:11:17] <hodapp> hexnewbie: there is another SATW comic that involves Finland saying anything besides "perkele" but I can't find it
[23:11:27] <Dagmar> At no point are you directly accessing where hte file is, so it makes little difference whats going on beind the read() calls
[23:11:40] <kurahaupo> So simply saying "it's not a file" is unhelpful unless you've already specified a definition of "file"
[23:11:43] <Dagmar> We literally have the kernel there to keep us from having to deal with that for this very reason.
[23:11:49] *** Joins: chovy (chovy@tilde.club)

[23:12:53] <Sauvin> That doesn't help ano trying to monitor mtime changes in procfs.
[23:13:08] <kurahaupo> Dagmar: That's a reasonable definition. What are the required behaviours?
[23:13:31] <Dagmar> Not being on heroin so that you think it makes sense to query mtime in a filesytsem for which mtime has zero meaning

[23:14:37] <raz_> therefore, do not assume special files can be treated the same.
[23:14:39] <Dagmar> DOing something the wrong way will remain the wrong way to do it
[23:15:30] <kurahaupo> raz_: "special file" has a specific meantime: S_IFMT != S_IFREG
[23:15:30] <hexnewbie> Expecting procfs to behave in any way sanely is a mistake. Part of the file API are intended to provide you with information, but generally the one a normal filesystem does. readlink() on /proc/self/fd/0 does not correspond with open(), stat() metadata can be filled with meaningful, but not to you, information, e.g. /proc/$pid mtime *may* be when the process *started*

[23:15:55] <Dagmar> If you want to monitor a filesystem for changes, the kernel has a mechanism for that, and it's not checking mtime

[23:51:50] <ayecee> hmm. do you think of network filesystems as virtual?

[23:52:38] <RadSurfer> Is there some clever Linux way (via terminal) of deleting a specific range of lines from a text file?
[23:52:53] <[[R]]> RadSurfer: sed or awk
[23:52:58] <RadSurfer> ...and resaving it again
[23:53:08] <ayecee> RadSurfer: sed -i '1000-2000d' or something like that.
[23:53:10] <raz_> sed -i will change the file in place
[23:53:13] <ayecee> i forget how the ranges work.
[23:53:34] <akoana> 1000,2000d
[23:53:40] <ayecee> so close
[23:53:42] <[[R]]> ayecee: it's where you shoot guns
[23:54:02] * Sauvin always winds up having to read the sed man page when he wants to use it, it's such a powerful but strange critter

[23:54:24] <ayecee> ditto, if only to confirm i got the range format right

[23:55:20] <raz_> ayecee: depending on what virtual means, yes i think so. you are translating client/server data and building a tree out of it and pretending its on your own device

[23:55:52] <ayecee> okay, how about if your own device is an iscsi device connected via a san?
[23:56:07] <raz_> i believe any network filesystems are virtual /
[23:56:09] <[[R]]> the iscsi is connected to the sannnn...
[23:56:16] <raz_> not really an expert with iscsi
[23:56:19] <[[R]]> the san is connected to the.... network...
[23:56:21] <RadSurfer> I get :: sed: -e expression #1, char 6: missing command
[23:56:45] <ayecee> raz_: the point is that it's still a disk, but connected via a network cable rather than a sata cable.

[23:56:51] <ayecee> RadSurfer: then you mistyped it
[23:57:23] <ayecee> or i dunno typed it verbatim for some reason as if it were a magic spell

[23:57:59] <raz_> ayecee: is that device handled by an operating system on the server side or connected directly to the client
[23:58:16] <RadSurfer> Awesome! I got it. thanks.

[23:58:41] *** Quits: KingKeA (~KingKeA@user/kingkea) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:59:28] <raz_> example, nfs, you are not contacting the device, you are contacting the server kernel which contacts the device.

[23:59:42] *** Quits: gladys (~jackie@user/jackiee) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[23:59:44] <raz_> not sure what virtual means..
[23:59:50] <ayecee> well i mean with sata, you're not contacting the disk, you're contacting the disk controller
[23:59:59] <raz_> heh
