[14:56:37] <dundargoc[m]> Quick question on lspconfig: each server has a section called `Commands and default values:` at the end. For example, if we take a look at [yamlls](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/CONFIG.md#yamlls) it says that the default value for `telemetry` is `enabled = false`. But if I expand the `Available settings` is says that the default value is `Default: vim.NIL`. Are these referring to different types of default values?

[15:05:23] <clason[m]> No, it looks more like a copy&paste error to me
[15:06:15] <dundargoc[m]> The `telemetry = false` being the error in this case I assume?
[15:06:55] <dundargoc[m]> Actually, I'm unsure.
[15:07:17] <clason[m]> unclear
[15:07:24] <clason[m]> evil server doesn't even mention telemetry in https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server#language-server-settings
[15:08:06] <dundargoc[m]> No need to call them evil just because they're corporate ;)
[15:08:20] <clason[m]> not mentioning telemetry at all evil
[15:08:24] <clason[m]> not to mention illegal
[15:08:33] <dundargoc[m]> No you're actually right, that's kinda fucked.
[15:09:03] <dundargoc[m]> Wait, do they have telemetry or is it just a copy-paste error?
[15:09:05] <clason[m]> Anyway, you have to distinguish between the server's default setting, and lspconfig's default setting (which may be different)
[15:09:13] <clason[m]> they do have telemetry
[15:09:27] <dundargoc[m]> ewww wtf
[15:09:39] <vigoux[m]> Wo boy yet another complicated lsp thing
[15:09:56] <clason[m]> here I'd expect that `null` is the server's default, which lspconfig overrides to `false` by default
[15:10:24] <dundargoc[m]> clason[m]: Well, yes, but in lspconfig's case only the lspconfig default should be relevant I think=
[15:10:32] <clason[m]> that could be made clearer in the document, though ("available" lists the _server_ defaults; the "commands and defaults" are for lspconfig)
[15:10:36] <clason[m]> yes
[15:11:28] <clason[m]> hence the "other default" is hidden in a spoiler (it's for reference)
[15:12:20] <dundargoc[m]> OK, but the intended interpretation is that the "Available settings" default is the servers own default values and the `Commands and default values:` default values is lspconfigs own default values that overrides the servers default values?
[15:12:29] <clason[m]> exactly
[15:13:06] <clason[m]> (I think "available settings" is auto-extracted from a VS Code JSON, but mjlbach may correct me.)
[15:13:11] <dundargoc[m]> clason[m]: No such thing as "hidden", I've read docs with information that is harder to find :)
[15:13:35] <clason[m]> well, it's hidden until you click on a thing...
[15:13:41] <dundargoc[m]> Leave no stones unturned :)
[15:13:51] <clason[m]> ("hidden" as in "not shown", not as in "hide and seek")
[15:14:27] <dundargoc[m]> Yeah, I was just joking.
[15:14:33] <dundargoc[m]> You're right
[15:14:34] <clason[m]> no worries
[15:15:32] <clason[m]> so you actually need to look at both: if you don't add any settings, you get the server defaults unless lspconfig has its own (default) setting that overrides it

[15:19:50] <dundargoc[m]> clason[m]: Not really though? The information is readily available if one wishes to change it. I think it makes more sense to modify lspconfig defaults that fit neovim best and if someone wishes to change that then they're free to do so.
[15:21:28] <dundargoc[m]> I usually don't buy the dichotomy between ease-of-use and maximizing configurability/extensibility.

[15:24:22] <clason[m]> It's the extent in this case; I'd assume there are Neovim users that would like to work on game development (and Twitch bears this out)
[15:24:34] <clason[m]> For them, the assumption makes it more difficult to configure since they need to undo settings to be able to use it effectively.
[15:24:57] <clason[m]> But I don't feel strongly enough about it to open a discussion on it.
[15:25:10] <dundargoc[m]> No you started it FIGHT ME
[15:25:16] <dundargoc[m]> Yeah me neither.
[15:25:37] <neovim[m]> couldn't you just add some kind of nvim_dev_defaults config table or something people can use if they want?
[15:25:46] <neovim[m]> that might be way overkill/unnecessary but just a thought
[15:25:58] <dundargoc[m]> neovim[m]: You mean me?
[15:26:14] <neovim[m]> "you" is general in this case, hurray for English ambiguity
[15:26:16] <clason[m]> Yeah, that's what I would have suggested
[15:27:10] <dundargoc[m]> I respectfully disagree. Sane defaults go a long way.
[15:27:16] <clason[m]> Alternatively, lua-language-server provides support for pre-configured (even auto-detected) "libraries" -- contributing a Neovim preset might serve this purpose as well.

[19:23:07] <bfredl> people use neovim to write real software which is not neovim itself??
[19:24:05] <mjlbach[m]> I would like to re-state the philosophy of lspconfig, as I think some people are saying what X and Y is. 
[19:24:05] <mjlbach[m]> Eventually, all of lspconfig's non-server config parts will be in core. At that point, it will be a bag of fallback configs. If your server is not popular enough to have a dedicated plugin, it's extremely easy to add the 5-10 lines to lspconfig and "forget about it" and it wil likely work in perpeteum. Users can install lspconfig, and fallback from dedicated plugins to these settings.
[19:24:05] <mjlbach[m]> However, the settings themselves should be the "expectation" of users within the confines of the protocol. Historically, I have deviated from this is small ways, if there are 1-2 off-protocol extensions that can be added with trivial code. In the case of lua-language-server, most neovim users are using it from neovim development (I would bet), so I think having lspconfig be pre-configured to send these options to lua-language-server minimizes
[19:24:05] <mjlbach[m]> user friction.

[20:05:46] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah the main improvement would be adding some compiled sysimage command 
[20:05:46] <clason[m]> probably these guys
[20:05:46] <dundargoc[m]> Dozens I tell you
[20:05:47] <clason[m]> https://julialang.org/research/#sponsors
[20:05:49] <mjlbach[m]> but that's out of scope and at that point a julia.nvim would be warranted
[20:05:56] <mjlbach[m]> and things like changing the active project
[20:06:20] <dundargoc[m]> Damn Helmut. Roasted his noname company and he left. :(
[20:06:43] <mjlbach[m]> I read like 3 pages on what ERB or whatever it is and I still don't get it
[20:06:49] <clason[m]> yeah, definitely not something lspconfig should (or need to) worry about
[20:06:50] <clason[m]> s/definitely/_definitely_/, s/need/needs/
[20:07:24] <clason[m]> (you can use compiled images with lspconfig just fine -- at least, if you can get it to compile, but that's on Julia, and no amount of Neovim tooling can help with that)
[20:08:10] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah I've done it before
[20:08:11] <dundargoc[m]> An annoying attribute acronyms have is that it can be extremely difficult to find information on it unless you know the context.
[20:08:16] <dundargoc[m]> What is erb?
[20:08:19] <neovim[m]> mjlbach[m]: is that like Julia but not JIT'd?
[20:08:19] <mjlbach[m]> I think julials has bigger performance issues though

[20:08:28] <neovim[m]> or did I miss what y'all are talking about
[20:08:34] <clason[m]> oh, yeah, julials is definitely not ready for primetime
[20:08:40] <mjlbach[m]> no its some business acronym for a type of software
[20:08:45] <clason[m]> the VS Code extension is... OK
[20:08:53] <clason[m]> but still fragile
[20:09:11] <neovim[m]> mjlbach[m]: oh, hence it not making sense, gotcha
[20:09:25] <clason[m]> I feel it's not really being taken seriously by enough people 
[20:09:47] <mjlbach[m]> this is so stupid but I only have enough room for 1 1-based indexed language in my heart
[20:10:00] <clason[m]> numbers start from 1
[20:10:03] <clason[m]> deal with it :)
[20:10:18] <dundargoc[m]> ???
[20:10:23] <mjlbach[m]> ugh mathematicians 
[20:10:27] <clason[m]> (well, they start with the empty set, but you know what I mean)
[20:10:39] <mjlbach[m]> pointer offsets tho
[20:10:47] <clason[m]> yeah, pointer offsets are different
[20:10:47] <neovim[m]> "just subtract 1 what's the problem"
[20:11:07] <dundargoc[m]> I have no idea what's going on, and at this point I'm afraid to ask.
[20:11:16] <clason[m]> but most languages have arrays as first-class data structures these days, so an index is not a pointer offset
[20:11:46] <neovim[m]> dundargoc[m]: no idea if this answers your question but first result on a ddg search https://hisham.hm/2021/01/18/again-on-0-based-vs-1-based-indexing/
[20:11:48] <clason[m]> (you will never hear me complain that C is zero-indexed, because there it fits what's actually going on)
[20:11:48] <mjlbach[m]> I C
[20:12:50] <neovim[m]> neovim[m]: okay actually this is more ranty lol
[20:12:56] <clason[m]> of course it's ranty
[20:13:00] <clason[m]> it's on the internet :)
[20:13:33] <dundargoc[m]> neovim[m]: Pet peeve: when people defend a position and bring up Ada and COBOL as in "see. They's doing it". It's not helping you buddy.
[20:13:47] <clason[m]> you mean aDa
[20:13:58] <neovim[m]> pretty sure it's A_d_A
[20:13:59] <dundargoc[m]> Oh bo
[20:14:06] <dundargoc[m]> Is it also case insen.?
[20:14:13] <neovim[m]> yeah
[20:14:19] <clason[m]> yes, that's what I wrote: aDA
[20:14:29] <dundargoc[m]> 🙄
[20:14:31] <neovim[m]> Ada doesn't have the nim underscore thing though afaik
[20:14:39] <dundargoc[m]> No one does
[20:14:43] <dundargoc[m]> Because lol
[20:14:55] <neovim[m]> l_o_l
[20:14:56] <clason[m]> no, back then nobody would have even thought of it

[20:15:09] <neovim[m]> anyways that article is for 1-based indexing? oops
[20:15:10] <clason[m]> (it was a simpler time...)
[20:15:19] <mjlbach[m]> I'm not going to debug lunarvim's julials config, the one is lspconfig is correct and should be used

[20:15:28] <clason[m]> that means LunarVim is outdated

[20:16:03] <mjlbach[m]> had like 4 julia users (and me) provide various improvements

[20:19:29] <kylo252[m]> anyways, this entire discussion is mostly about the support for julials in the installer. it seems like William isn't up for it lol
[20:19:31] <clason[m]> is that a sequel to that zombie movie?
[20:19:52] <clason[m]> yes, because it's a bad idea
[20:20:18] <mjlbach[m]> grumble grumble system package managers in neovim grumble
[20:20:33] <mjlbach[m]> it's also like one line to install julials
[20:21:00] <clason[m]> well, you do have to know a bit what you're doing to get something reasonable
[20:21:01] <kylo252[m]> it seems like that julia manager either wants to be a system package manager, or is the best package manage 😶
[20:21:17] <clason[m]> which is, of course, an argument _against_ punting this to an "installer"

[20:21:51] <kylo252[m]> what if I don't want to pollute my homedir? 
[20:21:58] <clason[m]> then you're SOL
[20:22:06] <mjlbach[m]> Julia puts it's environments in that location
[20:22:08] <kylo252[m]> is it a constant fight? ala luarocks? 
[20:22:10] <clason[m]> because Julia will already put gigabytes into your homedir
[20:22:13] <mjlbach[m]> that's how pkg3 jl works
[20:22:33] <mjlbach[m]> Even if you put the project somewhere else, it will still add stuff to .julia
[20:22:42] <clason[m]> mjlbach[m]: depends on what packages you want it to index
[20:22:46] <mjlbach[m]> It should still work
[20:23:00] <mjlbach[m]> the server install location doesn't have to match the environment being analyzed
[20:23:12] <mjlbach[m]> that's auto-detected based on the script embedded at the top of julials.lua
[20:23:19] <kylo252[m]> how many env variables it reads? why does it seem like it's more than one?
[20:23:40] <mjlbach[m]> JULIA_DEPOT_PATH and JULIA_PROJECT
[20:23:45] <mjlbach[m]> that's a julia thing though

[20:29:51] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: maybe it's just me, but there are more graceful ways to get the same point across and be tactful about it. you can answer one or 2 question and then tell the other person: 
[20:29:51] <kylo252[m]> - "oh it's great, if you want to learn more, then check out their guides online"

[20:30:10] <clason[m]> no, sorry
[20:30:40] <clason[m]> I get that this was tactless, but I wanted to make this point clear.
[20:30:49] <mjlbach[m]> tact takes effort

[20:40:41] <kylo252[m]> fwiw, I've been really pushing against any custom server configuration. Basically the same idea that it should be upstreamed instead.
[20:42:44] <kylo252[m]> most of the changes in nvim-lsp-installer are about `root_dir` as far as I can tell, I think we may need to think of an easier way to allow modifications to it

[20:52:17] <mjlbach[m]> the IRC bridge works fine

[20:55:21] <williamboman> Ah cool, hi all :). nvim-lsp-installer shouldn't be changing the root_dir of most servers. There might be a few like GraphQL (this one I've been meaning to patch to lspconfig). kylo252[m] (👋) both of those are servers that don't exist in lspconfig. eslintls was the precursor to eslint, and ltex is still in PR

[21:42:20] <mjlbach[m]> > it is still hard to solve either way
[21:42:20] <mjlbach[m]> these seem unrelated
[21:42:30] <mjlbach[m]> our behavior in this respect is actually very similar to vscode
[21:42:38] <mjlbach[m]> it usually doesn't attach the server to the system library files
[21:43:51] <arkurious> dmitmel[m]: Thank you.
[21:43:52] <Mathias[m]> mjlbach[m]: In an earlier version of the README I had a script there and some users also ended up copying verbatim without adjusting paths, so I'm not that sure anymore which version is better
[21:44:29] <mjlbach[m]> Mathias[m]: a junk script in contrib which prints a "WARNING if you are using this then you cannot file bug reports" which tries to automagically detect everything for you
[21:44:48] <kylo252[m]> <Mathias[m]> "Any opinions on whether the part..." <- all I can say is that jdtls is basically the hardest server to configure imo, mostly because you need a whole thing to set it up. 
[21:44:48] <kylo252[m]> I even had some weird problems happening when I tried to fix the complaints from shellcheck, I eventually had to give up and tell shellcheck to ignore it :( 
[21:45:35] <meijieruJieruMei> @williamboman:libera.chat It seems to be caused by `shortmess` setting.

[21:46:04] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach[m]: I think they don't want it to start attaching to the same filetype, which means dropping `autostart` which will in turn upset even more people 🤷

[21:47:12] <mjlbach[m]> you are probably referring to starting servers if the parent directory is not in a project
[21:47:27] <mjlbach[m]> anyways, it's fine, lspconfig2 will satisfy everyone whenever it's finished in the next year
[21:48:00] <mjlbach[m]> Because you can only special case scratch servers to start for files under /home, and projects to start under /home, so the server will ignore or include system libraries depending on the project pattern

[21:54:33] <mjlbach[m]> Mathias: how feasible would it be to write a simple shell script that "generates" the correct shell script which could be dumped in ~/.local/bin with all of the JDK variables set up?
[21:54:42] <mjlbach[m]> I think people aren't opposed to that
[21:56:09] <Mathias[m]> shouldn't be too hard, but you'd still have to configure that path to the eclipse.jdt.ls folder and to your data dir. But it would just be working around the fact that eclipse.jdt.ls doesn't ship with a launcher script - which is why I'm opposed to doing that
[21:56:39] <mjlbach[m]> The script could also download those
[21:56:51] <mjlbach[m]> s/those/jdtls so it would know that/
[21:56:53] <Mathias[m]> I'm even more opposed to that :p
[21:57:01] <mjlbach[m]> You know I know that I am opposed to that too
[21:57:17] <mjlbach[m]> because I think if someone uses software they should read the readme of the software they are using
[21:57:23] <mjlbach[m]> but like, it's a losing battle
