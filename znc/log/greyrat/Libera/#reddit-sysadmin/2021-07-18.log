[06:38:08] <sd> 07<J​aeBoz> So I think the drop box I should attack
[06:38:13] <xe0n> so the idea would be to look at what services the business needs, and work on one at a time
[06:38:14] <sd> 02<r​yalln> not nessarily
[06:38:20] <xe0n> dropbox is the last, it works, could it be better? yes, but it's the last
[06:38:24] <xe0n> it works for now, deal with that later
[06:38:37] <sd> 02<r​yalln> could be windows updates. could be machines caching drop box
[06:38:40] <xe0n> email? no brainer, hosted either in exchange online\google
[06:38:59] <sd> 02<r​yalln> Is there a bottle neck
[06:39:06] <xe0n> file services? sure you got dropbox, its a personal account, prob look at moving to either a business plan, or something along the lines of onedrive\sharepoint\teams
[06:39:11] <xe0n> tbh 365 would cover most of your bases
[06:40:04] <sd> 07<J​aeBoz> So
[06:40:08] <sd> 07<J​aeBoz> The drop boxes download like
[06:40:10] <sd> 07<J​aeBoz> Everything
[06:40:14] <sd> 07<J​aeBoz> And it’s really insane
[06:40:15] <xe0n> stop looking at it like a specific thing, bottle neck, all that deep dive crap, the answer is everything is unmanaged, and machines do whatever they want, thats the main issue. sort one service out at a time and you'll eventually make things work
[06:40:17] <xe0n> yeah no shit
[06:40:19] <sd> 07<J​aeBoz> They have a S drive
[06:40:23] <sd> 07<J​aeBoz> Too
[06:40:25] <xe0n> yep
[06:40:27] <sd> 07<J​aeBoz> So I don’t get the need
[06:40:30] <xe0n> so each service = a project
[06:40:34] <xe0n> project manage each one separately
[06:40:54] <sd> 07<J​aeBoz> I’m down for the challenge
[06:41:21] <sd> 07<J​aeBoz> A lot of the solutions include like a central admin for machines and migrating to business forms of these apps
[06:41:34] <sd> 07<J​aeBoz> I think I’ll look at the bandwidth map and work my way down
[06:41:37] <xe0n> yep, so unless the business has the budget and management is on board for changes, nothign will change
[06:41:43] <xe0n> things cost money, will cost money to solve these issues
[06:41:47] <sd> 02<r​yalln> draw up the end goal, and using that as your map
[06:41:56] <sd> 07<J​aeBoz> Good idea
[06:42:12] <xe0n> bandwidth map, who cares, you already know its dropbox, downloads, whatevere lse

[06:43:00] <xe0n> you dont need bandwidth to determine what proejcts to start working on
[06:43:10] <sd> 07<J​aeBoz> Oh I see what you mean
[06:43:12] <xe0n> look at what the business does, work out which core services they need, review each service, look at how you can improve etc
[06:43:24] <sd> 07<J​aeBoz> Just look at it all
[06:43:29] <sd> 07<J​aeBoz> Improve as much as I can.
[06:43:30] <xe0n> yes, one step at a time
[06:43:38] <xe0n> you start too many things at work, too much change or disruption, it'll be bust.
[06:43:40] <sd> 07<J​aeBoz> So should I hold off on the admin stuff until later
[06:43:41] <xe0n> and it'll take time and money.
[06:43:50] <sd> 07<J​aeBoz> And just do one at a time

[19:22:16] <DK3> got a job in a very big corporate with good pay, more vacation and stuff.  my boss is trying to hold me in my current company (datacenter with 70 employees part of a bigger cloud company from italy) with a significant payrise and change of responsibility. i'm in good relation with my current boss and i also do not hate to work there utterly. However management is utterly shit in that company and some
[19:22:18] <DK3> decisions and projects are based on purely lies from ceo. should i event consider their offer to keep me working there?
[19:22:44] <DK3> also looking forward to the new job with more pay, less responsibility and new opportunities..
[19:32:59] <Alternity> in the vast majority of situations you shouldn't take a counter offer. just think if they can suddenly offer you so much more money now why didn't they offer it to you before
[19:33:38] <Alternity> also saying you have a new job tends to make them think you might quickly jump again in the future. it can work out but very rarely in my experience
[19:34:22] <Alternity> upper management can make a record company go to the bigger company get more experience in a different kind of environment and then double your pay again in another couple years. 
[19:34:32] <Alternity> make or break a company*
[19:35:32] <Alternity> choice seems pretty clear to me. in tech you want to be changing jobs every 1-3 years 
[19:35:42] <Alternity> if you care about getting paid
[19:37:41] <DK3> im working there for 7 years already, worked my way up there as a operations lead. im having the same opionion as you. altough my new job as no leadership role its still better pay and let alone because of the shee size of the company (international) i could cramp my experience by alot in a shorter time i guess..
[19:39:24] <DK3> old company offered me a new department (new product segment) that i should build which is very appealing to me from a technical point of view. but i the targets for that department are unrealistic already.
[19:39:46] <DK3> sorry for the amount of typos.

[19:47:19] <Jaelae> i did something similar i think
[19:48:23] <Jaelae> i went from a decent job with good pay with about 100 employees. i had a lot of responsibility and was on call a bit - to a corporate environment with similar pay but the big difference is growth
[19:49:04] <Alternity> congrats on the new job definitely sounds like it's time to move on. not sure what your job goals are but I'd certainly encourage you to be more aggressive with Job searches in the future so you can be make sure you are paid what you're worth
[19:49:13] <Jaelae> but new corporate job i can retire here, lots of actual options here. i often see people leave a gig and move on somewhere else within the company
[19:49:24] <Jaelae> or vendors like azure and aws try to entice you
[19:49:30] <Alternity> I try to do at least a few job interviews every 6 months or so to keep my skills sharp and double check my worth on the open market
[19:49:41] <Jaelae> only thing is i should have stayed at my old job :)

[19:50:25] <Jaelae> i quit and had 90 days to buy my stock options. i couldnt buy all 8000 but could buy 5500 so i bought 500
[19:50:28] <DK3> Jaelae: sounds like my case, correct. On my end im On-Call like almost 24/7 :D. My goal is to get more pay and better work life balance to actually think of family and getting a house

[19:51:07] <Jaelae> yea so my old days we alternated on-call but still i had a lot of nighttime work. now in $corporatejob i have never worked after 6pm or on the weekend. our team in asia takes over
[19:51:39] <Alternity> Amen to that. if I work over 40 hours in a week I'll work less the next one
[19:51:58] <Alternity> though honestly I probably work maybe 20-25 hours a week. benefits of being remote you don't have to fake it LOL
[19:52:36] <Jaelae> old job was 100% permanent work from home new  orporate job i have to go in twice a week but honestly i quite like it
[19:52:52] <Jaelae> i get exposed to new technology, vendors to meet up with. moving back towards that with post-covid 
[19:52:57] <DK3> i also have more options to work from remote @corporate. at the moment they policy is not fully confirmed due to the pandemic but its looking good for a 100% work at home policy
[19:53:44] <Jaelae> yea thats nice. i mean how far it is though
[19:53:50] <DK3> actually i also like to go to the office sometimes, cause im getting along fine with my coworkers
[19:53:56] <Jaelae> we have a nice office where i work so i like going in. but its nice for like training and collab
[19:54:11] <Jaelae> though right now its all weird. they want us going in alternating between people but then i go into the office just to be on a call the whole day with someone thats home ;)
[19:54:45] <DK3> and you got to hear alot of stuff you wouldnt hear about if youre in a full remote position in german its called "flurfunk" :D
[19:54:53] <Jaelae> though we have a lot that get bored in one team and apply to another team in automation or info sec
[19:54:59] <Jaelae> then just bail on their workload and move over. its nice
[19:55:04] <Jaelae> retains you 401k and pension
[19:55:12] <Alternity> right now I'm interviewing for a company where the entire company is remote which should help with some of the company politics stuff
[19:55:25] <Alternity> my current gig maybe half of the people are in office
[19:56:13] <Alternity> in Europe it probably makes sense to be a little bit less aggressive with job changes since your social welfare and job laws are so much better

[21:03:37] <Sousapro> I'd look into the LPIC material and get really comfortable with configuration management 
[21:03:54] <asdfdd123314> Ok

[21:04:29] <asdfdd123314> I am just focusing on the basic cmd at the moment.
[21:04:33] <Sousapro> If I was trying to learn something you probably won't just by messing around with Linux, I'd get comfortable with RHEL/Cent 
[21:04:48] <asdfdd123314> Cent 7 is I am working with now.
[21:04:53] <asdfdd123314> Thanks for the advice!
[21:04:59] <Sousapro> Yeah if you're just getting your feet wet, definitely look at the materials for LPIC-1
