[04:03:43] <kristijonas> lunaphyte, if you remember your conversation a few days ago apie SPF: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/troubleshoot/antispam/false-positives so looks like the case #1
[04:04:40] <kristijonas> they say: "Within EOP, the SPF check is performed on IP address 2. (This is the on-premises mail server's relaying IP address.) However, the SPF check should have been performed on IP address 1. (This is the original connecting IP address.)"
[04:05:42] <kristijonas> But looks like they never discard messages even on spf hard fail, only deliver it to junk mail.

[05:20:20] <mendelmaleh> hi guys, when you setup self hosted email, are you expected to connect clients to the "primary domain" (eg example.org) or to a specific mx (mx1.example.org)?
[05:22:11] <mendelmaleh> i thought the point of mx records was that you don't need to rely on a specific one, but the clients i tried don't seem to work on the primary domain (k9 mail, mailspring, alps webmail)
[05:23:44] <mendelmaleh> i get a tls error when trying to use the primary one, because the server is running with a certificate for the mx domain
[05:32:34] <kristijonas> mendelmaleh, to the host (domain) that is in the mx record. so, mx1.example.org
[05:33:32] <mendelmaleh> ah, so if mx1 is down, i'm supposed to change it manually to mx2?
[05:35:09] <kristijonas> mendelmaleh, you can have a few mx records with different priority number
[05:37:28] <mendelmaleh> i know about the mx records, but i was expecting email clients to use them i guess
[05:38:37] <mendelmaleh> like, i can have mx1 and mx2 in my mx records for example.org, but what's the point if i need to connect clients to a specific mx
[05:38:47] *** Joins: SallyAhaj (~SallyAhaj@user/sallyahaj)
[05:39:25] <kristijonas> https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321#section-5.1 cause i'm not sure if I understood your question. if your mx record points to mx.example.com, in terms of TLS certificate, it has to match mx.example.com, not example.com
[05:41:47] <mendelmaleh> yes, that part i'm doing
[05:42:39] <mendelmaleh> so i guess mx records are only for mta's, not for end user email clients
[05:43:26] <kristijonas> mendelmaleh, can you clarify what problem you have and what you're trying to accomplish?
[05:44:24] <mendelmaleh> i want to connect my email client to example.org and it should automatically connect to the first available mx
[05:44:47] <mendelmaleh> at least, that's how i thought it was supposed to be, this is the first time i'm trying this
[05:45:22] <mendelmaleh> did i get it wrong?
[05:47:19] <minimal> mendelmaleh: by "email client" do you mean SMTP client or IMAP/POP client?
[05:47:27] <kristijonas> the full picture is well explained here: https://explained-from-first-principles.com/email/#official-architecture
[05:47:49] <mendelmaleh> minimal: the app i use on my phone, it has both smtp and imap 
[05:48:11] <minimal> mendelmaleh: MX records are only relevant for SMTP, nothing to di with IMAP
[05:48:31] <mendelmaleh> ah
[05:48:40] <mendelmaleh> but it's not used even for the smtp part of the app?
[05:49:45] <mendelmaleh> kristijonas: thanks for the chart
[05:49:59] <minimal> mendelmaleh: possibly. I'd expect you define multiple A (or AAAA) records to point the DNS name the email uses to the SMTP and IMAP servers
[05:51:40] <mendelmaleh> hm i think i'm supposed to do that with SRV records
[05:52:12] <mendelmaleh> so i guess those too are on the mx domain instead of the primary/base domain?
[05:52:13] <kristijonas> mendelmaleh, do you have different preference numbers for different mx records?
[05:52:19] <mendelmaleh> no
[05:52:24] <minimal> sure you could use those instead - different ways to do things
[05:52:38] <mendelmaleh> i just have one as of now anyway
[05:53:30] <mendelmaleh> minimal: with the a records you make a subdomain for the protocol? and you point it to the mx host?
[05:53:41] <minimal> MX domain? there's no such thing - there are MX records which you can have associated with DNS names
[05:54:33] <mendelmaleh> mx server then?
[05:55:18] <minimal> you point the DNS name used by your clients for SMTP and IMAP to point to your SMTP and IMAP server(s) using 1 or more A records (or cnames) pointing to the servers
[05:55:32] <minimal> nothing to do with MX
[05:58:56] <mendelmaleh> oh i see now
[05:59:09] <mendelmaleh> i wasn't aware you can have multiple a records for a domain
[05:59:27] <minimal> that's a form of "load balancing"
[06:00:14] <minimal> depending on how your DNS server software is configured (if it re-orders the A results each time)
[06:00:22] <kristijonas> minimal, i believe that you also can do load balancing by having multiple MX records with the same preference number?
[06:01:06] <minimal> kristijonas: yes but I'm not sure if typical email clients handle MX records, especially if they're using the SMTP Submission port

[07:59:00] <kristijonas> "SPF breaks when the email goes through an indirect mail flow, like when it's forwarded. Since the intermediate server's IP address is different than the originating one's, and it might not be on the whitelist, the email can fail SPF authentication on the destination server." (Also: A receiving SMTP server may be the ultimate destination, an
[07:59:00] <kristijonas> intermediate "relay" (that is, it stores and forwards the message) or a "gateway" (that is, it may forward the message using some protocol other than SMTP). Any solution then other than authenticated received chain (ARC)?
[08:25:42] <lunaphyte> !tell kristijonas mantras
[08:25:43] <dig-dug> kristijonas: mantras: 1. do not accept mail that you do not intend to deliver. 2. do not drop mail. 3. do not use wildcards or catchalls. 4. do not forward mail to third party systems
[08:26:02] <lunaphyte> the solution is #4.  don't forward mail to third party systems
[08:32:03] <kristijonas> lunaphyte, the also part (in parenthesis) was actually a quote from https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321#section-2.1
[08:34:56] <lunaphyte> so?
[08:36:21] <kristijonas> lunaphyte, and also probably if both intermediary server and the final destination is something you are in control with (just different servers with different IPs), the correct way would be SPF check on intermediary system (the first receiving hop from mx record), and not on the final destination, right?
[08:42:06] <lunaphyte> other systems can perform spf checks, provided that they have awareness of the overall mail flow
[08:42:46] <lunaphyte> for example, a common scenario is a content filter server, beyond the mx, which does spf checks as part of its content filtering
[09:33:51] <kristijonas> lunaphyte, either way, that's news to me that not only do SPF verifies can check MAIL FROM identify, but HELO identify as well.

[16:43:51] <dupondje> Somebody knows some (open-source) mail/postfix 'archive' milter? Goal is to have some sort of duplicate of all mails (even spam) in order to be able to redeliver them if needed.
[16:44:17] <dupondje> Should'nt be a milter, but I think thats the best place to inject it :)
[17:20:18] <lunaphyte> why would something need to be redelivered?  what's the actual problem?
[17:29:47] <dupondje> lunaphyte: customer deletes mail by accident. customer configged his phone as POP3 and emptied mailbox. some mail was blocked as spam but was not spam and needs to be accepted anyway.... etc :)
[17:46:19] <lunaphyte> for the first problem, i would suggest you take backups as per standard patterns
[17:47:12] <lunaphyte> for the second problem, that's a problem which shouldn't really exist :)
[17:50:00] <lunaphyte> don't block spam.  tag it, and deliver it to a junk mailbox
[17:50:36] <dupondje> lunaphyte: :) The final destination is not always self-managed. So thats why something in between should keep a copy :)
[17:50:58] <lunaphyte> what is meant by final destination and self managed?
[17:51:45] <dupondje> lunaphyte: aka the server where the mailbox(storage) itself is, is not managed by us/not backupped
[17:52:40] <dupondje> its a feature most commercial anti-spamfilters have btw :)
[17:53:35] <lunaphyte> maybe
[17:55:10] <dupondje> anyway, no (open source) solution you know that has this kind of functionality? :)
[17:55:37] <lunaphyte> have you looked at piler?
[17:56:43] <dupondje> lunaphyte: nope, I'll give it a look
