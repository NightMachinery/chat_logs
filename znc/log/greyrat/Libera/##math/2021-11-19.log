[00:00:50] <droid3> so how are the navier stokes people using approximation algorithms if there not in the case of one solution ????
[00:01:20] <droid3> They must be adding boundary constraints in such away to yield the problem in a unquie setting so they can approximate it???
[00:02:01] <droid3> So navier stokes , minimal surfaces,...etc nonlinear PDE with boundary condition is quite an issue in determining if numerical approximation methods are applicable.
[00:02:37] <droid3> OR how these navier stokes people are putting the problem in a unquie setting to approximating it is elluding me as of current.
[00:03:33] <droid3> however i admit alot of this boundary conditions are based on physical principals so maybe the physicists no more on how/why/when we can make these nonlinear PDE into a one solution approximation form.

[02:09:17] <droid3> that what i am asking hope you understand.
[02:09:19] <dude12312414> what do you mean by first and second
[02:09:53] <dude12312414> ODEs are by definition only interested in one independent variable

[02:10:53] <dude12312414> hm
[02:11:06] <dude12312414> i think i understand what you mean actually
[02:11:09] <droid3> for example

[02:15:35] <dude12312414> i think that's just because in practice, we know the state of the system initially and we want to predict the future evolution
[02:16:04] <droid3> And that great because we always have nice theorems say we have a unquie solution in some region about the initial point. So we can always talk about the one solution and try to approximate it with numerical algorithms /FEM.

[02:17:25] <droid3> But when boundary value conditions are imposed on ODE instead we dont have in general such a theory so we cannt really begin to approximate the ODE without first proving that these particular boundary conditions for this ODE gives a unquie solution to attempt to approximate with FEM..etc

[02:26:10] <droid3> I suppose sense linear ODE with constant cofficients is pretty easy to solve this reduce a boundary value problem to system of linear equations. And solving it yields no solution , one solution , or many solutions.
[02:27:20] <droid3> But this is not so interesting since we already know how to solve all linear ODE with constant coefficients heck its easy enough to solve the boundary value problem completely for these special case
[02:27:58] *** Joins: voices- (~voices_@84.238.197.28)
[02:28:22] <droid3> all it be is solving a matrix system of cofficients after you found the general solution of the linear ODE with constant cofficients.
[02:28:53] <droid3> Heck we teach students how basically to do this in a basic ODE class.
[02:29:45] <droid3> But the linear ODE case where the cofficients are functions/nonconstant is much more challenging for the boundary value type problems....
[02:30:24] <droid3> Sure if there is initial conditions we can always solve a ODE even the nonlinear types of any order , even the system of nonlinear ODE,...etc
[02:31:01] <droid3> But change that condition to boundary conditions we only have a complete solution in the case of linear constant cofficient ODE of any order.
[02:32:29] <droid3> Sturm–Liouville theory is an attempt to break away from boundary value problems being stuck in only solvable in general to the linear constant coefficient ODE
[02:33:26] <droid3> But that a very special case even still... aka second order ODE with nonconstant coefficients

[02:43:38] <droid3> If so i like to here from you!!!
[02:45:03] <droid3> I was thinking we could always just add in initial conditions instead so there will exist always away to convert a boundary value problem to a boundary value problem that admits only one unquie solution
[02:45:50] <droid3> But by doing so you kind of need to know physically what way you should add additional conditions to model stuff
[02:46:46] <droid3> because changing the boundary conditions to initial conditions or adding extra boundary conditions or adding extra initial conditions to the boundary conditions
[02:47:02] <droid3> can drastically change what your approximating i imagine
[02:48:16] <droid3> And you have to know that adding these certain "conditions"  is from a FEM/numerical approximation method the right target solution you want to analysis

[02:58:38] <PlanckWalk> And then you take a limit as parameter -> 0
[02:58:49] <droid3> its being able to determine when we are in the case of a unquie solution or not and if not being able to some how make sense of how to preceed in approximating the many solutions

[03:06:26] <droid3> this nonlinear ODE with boundary conditions also is an issue.

[03:13:11] <greenbagels> lets say a function f that maps from A to B

[03:13:47] <greenbagels> and injective if distinct values of A get mapped to distinct values of B
[03:13:56] <droid3> Obviously if we can solve the ODE or PDE in closed form then sure we can approximate any particular solution with FEM. Because we would then know the exact constraints to use to approximate a particular solution by FEM

[05:16:39] <cuppajoeman> In a locally compact space X which is hausdorff, given a point x in X we get some compact neighborhood around x, (neighborhood means open too), so then X is both open and closed since it's also compact in a hausdorff space?
[05:17:48] <PlanckWalk> If X is a topological space, then X is always open and closed
[05:18:17] <PlanckWalk> No local compactness, Hausdorffness, or anything else needed.
[05:18:41] <Z-module> By axiom, both {} and X are open, for any space at all. Thus they are both closed as well, being mutual complements in X.
[05:19:35] <Z-module> a space X is connected iff X and {} are the *only* clopen subsets  ("clopen" means both closed and open)

[05:21:32] <Z-module> cuppajoeman: being locally compact does not mean each point has an open nbhd. U and is also compact.  It's the closure of U that's compact.

[05:22:08] <cuppajoeman> Sorry I meant to speak of the compact neighborhood around x, but accidentally wrote X

[05:27:44] <Z-module> There's a whole list of equivalent definitions where the equivalence is only true if the space is hausdorff
[05:28:11] <PlanckWalk> "Neighbourhood of x" often means "set that contains an open set that contains x"
[05:28:26] <PlanckWalk> Not necessarily just "open set that contains x"
[05:28:31] <Z-module> yes, that one there is right, but note that here they do NOT require nbhds. to be open sets. They're using the other definition of nbhd.
[05:28:50] <Z-module> (a nbhd. of x is a set containing contain an open set around x)
[05:29:17] <cuppajoeman> ok, I'll try to remember the differences
[05:29:46] <Z-module> so then theirs is the same as what I said up there: each x is in some open nbhd. U whose closure is compact.
[05:30:33] <Z-module> it's the same because if you have x, contained in a compact set K that contains an open U around x, then the closure of U is also compact so we could have used this as the original K

[05:44:33] <cuppajoeman> Regular: One point sets are closed,  and for x in X and C subseteq X (closed) with { x} \cap C = {}, then there are disjoint open sets containing x and B respectively

[08:17:10] <droid3> PlanckWalk one additional thing i thought of is use shoot methods. But are shoot methods only appliable in the case of second order ODE /PDE
[08:18:10] <droid3> basically your approximating the boundary value conditions with sequences of initial conditions. And we know initial condition problems have a unquie solution. There for if we hit on it satisfying the boundary conditions at some point.
[08:18:34] <droid3> we would have found a boundary value solution to the problem
[08:18:52] <droid3> But convergence and what region its valid would be my issues
[08:19:39] *** Quits: xkuru (~xkuru@user/xkuru) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:19:41] <droid3> we have finite element and finite differences but all those methods only work if where in a unquie boundary value problem solution situation
[08:20:05] <droid3> which we dont know of in general and most of the time we arent
[08:24:31] <droid3> And yes if you where thinking of turning the problem of solving a ODE or PDE into some sort of minimization problem such as Rayleigh-Ritz then that still relies on knowing we are talking about a unquie solution
[08:25:26] <droid3> So i am stuck PlanckWalk about what you said on how ones ruling out a solution and approximating it when the boundary value problem is many solutions case????
[08:26:03] <droid3> Every approximation algorithm i come across is assuming the boundary conditions give rise to a unquie solution to approximate.

[18:32:25] <rubiksdream> my idea is that given we omit just two points, necessarily on the boundary of omega, there must be some curve very close to this circle entirely contained in Omega, and winding around p

[18:35:23] <Franciman> and create a new curve
[18:35:25] <Franciman> totally inside Omega

[18:48:30] <cherim> Suppose somebody asks you "I understand how Schwarz-Christoffel maps boundary to boundary, but why doesn't it map extra points to the boundary", how do you answer?
[18:48:51] <cherim> I had the impression that the proof goes backwards
[18:49:57] <cherim> There exists a conformal mapping of domains for general reasons, and then you prove that it must have Schwarz-Christoffel form by considering boundary
[18:50:01] <rubiksdream> it does, schwarz christoffel derives a form
[18:50:19] <rubiksdream> as in, ive used a similar argument to SC to show, any conformal map D -> exterior of star, has this form

[20:48:39] <azonenberg> Suppose I have an electrical signal of unknown shape traveling down a wire
[20:49:02] <azonenberg> I simultaneously measure the voltage at two points, X and Y, with a known distance/delay between them
[20:49:47] <azonenberg> Suppose the signal then hits some mismatch further down the wire and part of it reflects back. So now the voltage seen on the wire at any point is a sum of the incident signal and various reflected copies of it
[20:50:05] <azonenberg> Is it possible to, given the two measurements, separate just the incident or just the reflected signal?
[20:50:11] <azonenberg> my gut feeling says yes
[20:50:27] <azonenberg> as a trivial example, if your incident signal is a single pulse
[20:50:34] <[itchyjunk]> sounds like a phy question but maybe someone here will know too
[20:50:37] <azonenberg> when you first see it propagating down the line that's your incident signal
[20:50:51] <azonenberg> if  you then see another pulse later it's reflected, since your incident signal is zero at that time
[20:51:04] <azonenberg> The challenge comes when the incident signal is not zero at the time the reflection arrives

[22:31:11] <ProfSimm> Decker, it's a useful property if this "unidirectional" mapping is what you want
[22:31:34] <Decker> until you get to a 0e
[22:31:55] <Decker> (unless?)
[22:32:02] <ProfSimm> I don't know.
