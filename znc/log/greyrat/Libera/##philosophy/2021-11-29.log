[09:22:41] <hax> apotheon, I live in canada, and I think we have a different kind of relationship with free speech
[09:22:54] <apotheon> sure
[09:23:00] <hax> so not making everything open to everyone doesn't concern me
[09:23:05] <apotheon> This isn't the channel I meant, but it'll do.
[09:23:30] <hax> oh right I didn't read clearly
[09:23:41] <apotheon> It concerns me, in part because there's always someone who decides what's allowable, and there are always unjustly marginalized groups, when censorship begins.
[09:24:25] <hax> sure, but even the american version of free speech doesn't apply everywhere, right?
[09:24:50] <apotheon> Just because I live in the US doesn't mean I agree with US government policy on the first amendment.
[09:25:20] <hax> like saying threatening sounding words in airports, towards police, etc. No for sure, I only mention it as a common example of free speech
[09:25:28] <apotheon> . . . but obviously malicious deception is a case where it's not really "free speech" any longer, and becomes "freedom to be an asshole who could intentionally get people killed".
[09:25:58] <apotheon> I don't think police should have special privileges regarding protecting them from getting their feelings hurt, though.
[09:26:09] <hax> haha i agree for sure

[09:27:14] <hax> what about hate speech? I can't see a reason to allow people to use it publicly. I think it can be defined well enough to where the law catches more offenders than false-positives
[09:28:22] <apotheon> "hate speech" so far is not defined well at all, and creates special classes of people for special protection while leaving others out in the cold
[09:28:29] <apotheon> and those being protected weaponize it, often enough
[09:28:51] <hax> the counter is that allowing it allows speech to be weaponized
[09:28:55] <apotheon> If some rule screws over people who don't deserve it, it's a bad rule.

[09:29:43] <hax> or whatever qualifies. I'm no lawyer
[09:29:57] <apotheon> In a choice between someone being hurt because of a guilty person going free and someone being hurt becuase an innocent person gets fucked by the rules, I'd choose the guilty person going free.
[09:30:02] <apotheon> Injustice does not repair injustice.
[09:30:06] <apotheon> First, do no harm.
[09:30:22] <hax> but I think words can do harm

[09:30:42] <apotheon> when in doubt, leave it out

[09:33:15] <apotheon> . . . so you're saying it's permissible sometimes to throw someone in prison for nothing as long as the same rule results in someone else getting thrown in prison for saying something frightening.
[09:33:35] <apotheon> I disagree.
[09:33:44] <apotheon> . . . and it seems we have no common ground on that issue at the moment.
[09:33:53] <hax> no, I'm saying you can't abolish something just because you might get it wrong. might.
[09:34:06] <hax> hm maybe not.
[09:34:07] <apotheon> It's not just "might".  Courts get it wrong on a regular basis.
[09:34:11] <apotheon> pretty much every law
[09:34:22] <hax> sure, but what's the alternative?
[09:34:36] <hax> they also more often get it right, I'd guess

[09:35:23] <apotheon> I guess you'd support a law that got you thrown in prison for what you were saying in that other channel, then, as long as two people got thrown in prison for blatant racism.
[09:35:34] <hax> and a good example of what you're talking about :)

[21:08:10] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: look into what they are saying, and youll find it contrasts with things said in 2016 when this article is from
[21:08:15] <I_Am_M00t> "if we don't extract oil, someone else will do it, and dirtier too!"
[21:08:38] <zicada> yeah
[21:09:15] <I_Am_M00t> this was done for coal too, in the US I think
[21:09:24] <I_Am_M00t> a fallacious argument
[21:09:52] <zicada> if the choice is between the rest of the world buying all its oil and gas from the middle east and russia, and Norway selling relatively less dirty gas and oil as well as not creating a monopoly in the middle east
[21:09:57] <zicada> that choice is easy for me
[21:10:51] <zicada> logically its a fallacious argument. in the real world, given choices, it still makes sense
[21:10:55] <I_Am_M00t> did you completely miss the point?
[21:10:59] <zicada> nope
[21:11:11] <zicada> i understand your point well
[21:11:12] <I_Am_M00t> that argument has no merit
[21:11:51] <I_Am_M00t> it's not a logically fallacious argument, it has no merit
[21:12:25] <I_Am_M00t> it's something fossil interests throw out, even when evidence points in the other direction
[21:22:50] <zicada> youll find Norway is going to be quite different from Russia and the Sudis and so on in how they talk about his and try to handle it politically
[21:23:16] <zicada> i do doubt we are going to stop pumping up oil and gas on this planet as long as there is demand though, sadly i do
[21:23:45] <zicada> itll be over when its not economically feasible to do it anymore
[21:24:45] <zicada> We'll need to have come up with a new source for plastics, pharmaceuticals, and all the others that require oil too

[21:44:12] <I_Am_M00t> zicada: sorry, can you just in short name what the fallacy is about?
[21:44:37] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: like the article says, its "drug dealer thinking"
[21:44:44] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: if we dont, somebody else will
[21:45:08] <zicada> or was the thing about the fallacy not related to the oil thing ?
[21:46:17] <I_Am_M00t> it is related to the oil thing, but the important part is not the essence of the fallacy, but the fact that several analyses support the idea that it's fallacious
[21:46:53] <I_Am_M00t> it's also a fallacy that has been used to support coal production
[21:47:25] <zicada> it works a little different on a global scale between nations, than it does on a local scale between individuals
[21:47:36] <zicada> it ought not to, but it seems to anyway
[21:47:46] <I_Am_M00t> how is that comment relevant?
[21:48:06] <I_Am_M00t> several analyses support the idea that it's a logical fallacy, as related to fossil fuels like oil
[21:48:09] <zicada> the analysees youre referring to look at the drug dealer fallacy globally
[21:48:15] <I_Am_M00t> what?
[21:48:16] <zicada> you are comparing this to the individual level
[21:48:41] <I_Am_M00t> the analysis looks at oil and coal production, international dynamics
[21:48:46] <I_Am_M00t> global dynamics
[21:50:09] <I_Am_M00t> it seems you think that this is a fallacy about local phenomena---no, it's a fallacy that states that, on a global scale, it is not true that when one nation decreases fossil fuel production, it is automatically filled by fossil fuel from another country
[21:50:52] <zicada> some say it is, others say it isnt
[21:51:07] <zicada> depending on where they got funding in a lot of caes
[21:51:09] <zicada> cases
[21:51:13] <I_Am_M00t> that's not how it works, there are actual studies on this

[23:31:45] <apotheon> Are we still on fossil fuels here?
[23:32:42] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: its not evidence though
[23:32:43] <apotheon> zicada: If global production competition was constricted by the change, prices would increase.
[23:32:57] <apotheon> all else being equal, of course
[23:33:19] <apotheon> There should, of course, then be a reduction at least at the margins.
[23:33:24] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: how is the callphone arguent a strawman ? I merely replaced oil with cellphones. Youd have to tell me why oil is different enough that i cant do that
[23:34:54] <zicada> apotheon: demand would be greater than supply, which would warrant increasing supply. The middle east can produce a lot more, they are purposefully balancing this through OPEC
[23:35:34] <zicada> so this argument would only hold if other oilproducers were unable to increase supply
[23:35:43] <zicada> which we know they are not, at all
[23:35:49] <apotheon> not necessarily
[23:36:01] <apotheon> Increasing supply incurs costs and changes long-term strategy.
[23:36:50] *** Joins: econo (uid147250@user/econo)
[23:36:53] <apotheon> If the increases in price provide better profit margins than increased production to maintain similar overall production, failing to increase production (as much) might be the better play.
[23:40:11] <zicada> apotheon: the opec countries can very easily increase or decrease supply
[23:40:19] <zicada> even from one day to the next
[23:40:30] <apotheon> and yet
[23:40:36] <apotheon> my point still stands
[23:40:55] <apotheon> I'm not saying that's what would happen -- just that it's a distinct possibility.
[23:41:03] <zicada> it is
[23:41:15] <apotheon> I'm sure there are strategic concerns in how they handle these things that are not easily discerned by us.
[23:42:19] <apotheon> Mostly, producers would be unwilling to reduce their *own* production without some overriding motivation, because it would reduce their share of the market, but they might be happy to have someone else reduce their production to reap the benefits of higher prices.
[23:44:07] <apotheon> In fields where there's heavy concentration of power in a well-defined, relatively small number of participants, détente is a common state of affairs, where rocking the boat can be damaging to profits by creating an economic war between stakeholders.
[23:45:14] <apotheon> When someone at least partially drops out, participants might have to weigh the ability to make more by selling more against not only the ability to make more by doing nothing different but also the possibility of a decision to increase production and sales sparking renewed competitive actions.
[23:45:56] <apotheon> It could go either way, as far as I'd judge it, in this case.
