[00:12:21] <GuiToris> Only today I learned that there is such a thing as the doomsday clock. How can you start a clock from 23:58? It just seems like scaremongering to me.
[00:12:58] <TimMc> GuiToris: At what time of day is it permissible to create a regular clock?
[00:13:08] <blkshp> 25:58:20
[00:13:14] <blkshp> 23:58:20
[00:13:30] <GuiToris> I preferred 25
[00:13:43] <blkshp> This is not Federation Station Deep Space Nine.
[00:13:58] <GuiToris> and the fact that it is regularly adjusted backwards and forwards makes it completely pointless
[00:14:09] <blkshp> It's a symbol not a clock.
[00:14:26] <GuiToris> just to make people more worried
[00:14:44] <Babar> ...you're welcome AmalLight?
[00:15:47] <GuiToris> blkshp, I looked up, I don't know what was wrong with me... I thought you were referring to some kind of real NASA thing
[00:16:53] <TimMc> You're right, the Doomsday Clock should only go forwards.
[00:16:58] <TimMc> I will help make that happen!

[00:41:25] <berndj> I really dislike how American English has made "through" a sort of synonym of "to". Example: "The route, which is over 400 kilometers long, runs along the M7 federal highway through the Moscow Ring Road."
[00:42:09] <berndj> Now I have to guess whether that's "through" as in the route ends at the ring road, or "through" as in it passes through the ring road and continues on the other side.

[00:51:15] <bin> (I'm American)
[00:51:54] <berndj> I agree, it should not be a synonym.
[00:52:12] <bin> if someone is using it as one, that's incorrect
[00:52:24] <bin> what I'm saying is it's not actually a synonym in AmE

[00:53:42] <bin> yes, agreed

[00:54:09] <berndj> I'm not as angry about, say, "Pick any of lanes 4 through 7", but I routinely see "through" used to indicate termination of some process that isn't a natural sequence.

[02:31:13] <GuiToris> 'This is out of line' what does this mean?

[02:33:55] <GuiToris> thanks, there may be one more thing that I don't get
[02:34:25] <GuiToris> actually 2
[02:34:35] <GuiToris> She still swings my way
[02:34:57] <mdogg> In what context is that used?
[02:35:04] <semitones> that one isn't as common
[02:35:19] <GuiToris> these are lyrics, so may not be perfectly grammatical
[02:35:50] <GuiToris> And until this day, She still swings my way, But it's sad to say, Sometimes she says she loves me not
[02:36:10] <mdogg> That ok.  If you could paste some more of the lyrics preceding and following that phrase it would be helpful. 
[02:36:22] <mdogg> ooh Ok.
[02:38:26] <GuiToris> umm, do you need even more?
[02:38:29] <mdogg> I interoperate that to mean that the person who is speaking believes that the lady (she) is generally fond of him and may even like him.  But she has told him that she isn't in love with him.
[02:39:07] <GuiToris> is 'fond' used in America?!
[02:39:08] <mdogg> That's just my take, though.
[02:39:12] <mdogg> Sure.
[02:39:21] <GuiToris> interesting, I thought it was a chiefly British word
[02:39:34] <mdogg> No, they stole it from us.
[02:39:37] <mdogg> =P
[02:39:54] <GuiToris> if blk$hp hear this
[02:39:57] <GuiToris> heard
[02:40:17] <GuiToris> so the last one is : I want out today 
[02:40:19] <GuiToris> more context?
[02:40:25] <GuiToris> or is this straight forward?
[02:41:05] <mdogg> Well, "I want out" probably means out of the relationship.  But more context would be helpful.
[02:41:51] <GuiToris> But I hesitate, To tell her I hate, This relationship, I want out today, This is over
[02:41:57] <GuiToris> this is so hard for me to understand
[02:42:02] <mdogg> Yeah - out of the relationship.
[02:42:08] <mdogg> He's done with her.
[02:42:14] <GuiToris> got it, thank you
[02:42:32] <mdogg> NP - that was fun.
[02:42:39] <GuiToris> none of these were colloquial, right?
[02:42:53] <GuiToris> are they weird because they are lyrics?
[02:48:34] <mdogg> Well, lyrics are like poetry.  So when you read a poem or listen to lyrics, it is completely different than reading a newspaper article for example.  This is a good description of how poems and lyrics differ from other writing styles -->  https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/out_of_line

[21:42:10] <Voxel> I'm sorry?
[21:42:26] <lall-> if they got troubles, sorry to inconvenience you, but i appreciate your effort. depends on the context really.
[21:43:26] <Voxel> They encountered issues. I'm not the source of it.
[21:43:39] <Voxel> I'm just try to help and radiate some moral help.
[21:43:43] <Voxel> trying*
[21:43:47] <lall-> Moral support?
[21:43:54] <Voxel> Precisely
[21:44:31] <Voxel> Like. Hey! I'm sorry to.... Let's try investigating! Have you tried...?
[21:44:58] <lall-> Again, depends on the context. You can say... I'm there with you buddy, let me know if I can help you in any way. There are many ways to respond to that.
[21:45:18] <Voxel> The above format is preffered.
[21:45:31] <Voxel> More formal.
[21:45:49] <Voxel> The context. They encountered legal issues
[21:46:02] <Voxel> They lost their passport for example.
[21:46:21] <Voxel> ID*
[21:47:14] <lall-> Context in sense of your relationship with the subject. If somebody is experiencing any kind of trouble, depending who you are to them, is the relative strength of your words, but words bring you so far. There's no exact way of answering that question really
[21:47:26] <Voxel> I don't know them.
[21:47:38] <Voxel> It's formal conversation.
[21:47:43] <Voxel> a formal*
[21:48:45] <lall-> in the formal context, it would be something like: I'm sorry for your troubles. In the formal context you don't want to go into details.
[21:49:13] <Voxel> I'm not the issue source. "I'm sorry for troubles" sounds like I am the source of it.
[21:49:52] <lall-> no, it doesn't. it sounds like you're emphatic to their trouble.
[21:50:03] <lall-> people say, I'm sorry for you rloss, when somebody dies
[21:50:11] <Voxel> I see.
[21:50:16] <lall-> that doesn't mean they caused their death, it just means empathy.
[21:50:45] <Voxel> Well... it's quite double sigthed ^^

[21:51:44] <tinsoldier> ambiguous — Adjective: 1. Open to multiple interpretations., 2. (obsolete, of persons) Hesitant; uncertain; not taking sides. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ambiguous
[21:51:51] <lall-> but you can't just say I'm sorry. you have to sort of... explain why you sorry for. If your friend gor fired from a job, you could say... I'm sorry that that happened to you
[21:53:07] <Voxel> What do you thin about "I am sorry to know that"?
[21:53:27] <Voxel> Or, "I am sorry to hear that"
[21:53:48] <Voxel> "I am sorry to know that it resulted in an error"
[21:54:02] <lall-> people say that when somebody say something personal to them, but they themselves are not emotionally connected to what happened
[21:54:14] <Voxel> Hm.
[21:54:19] <lall-> pretty much BS... but polite.
[21:54:23] <Voxel> Ahhah
[21:54:41] <lall-> if somebody told me, they got divorced from their wife... because X,Y,Z... I might say, I'm sorry to hear that.
[21:54:53] <Voxel> Like, "I am sorry to know that. Understandable. Have a nice day".
[21:55:16] <Voxel> In short, "Disperse"
[21:55:20] <lall-> Yeah, it's platitude.
[21:55:42] <Voxel> .d platitude
[21:55:43] <lall-> platitude > a remark or statement, especially one with a moral content, that has been used too often to be interesting or thoughtful.
[21:55:44] <tinsoldier> platitude — Noun: 1. (countable) An often-quoted saying that is supposed to be meaningful but has become unoriginal or hackneyed through overuse; a cliché., 2.
