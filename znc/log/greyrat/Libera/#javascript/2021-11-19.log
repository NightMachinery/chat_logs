[08:23:13] <systemfault> I've learned this shit a very long time ago... no clue for videos or anything.
[08:23:21] <systemfault> That said, it all starts with the bundler.
[08:23:42] <systemfault> babel is used as a plugin for your bundler
[08:23:54] <systemfault> And React works on top of those.
[08:24:33] <systemfault> The "often used" bundler for React application is called Webpack...
[08:25:09] <systemfault> If you don't know already, first learn how to start a project with node and npm first.
[08:25:18] <systemfault> Modern frontend dev is complex...

[16:20:22] <lantech19446> zsoc designed a piece of software for me in js using nodejs and i'm wondering what does nodejs bring to the table.

Is that something that can be done in vanilla js or does nodejs facilitate that kind of thing?

[16:25:45] <joakimk> But when they say, "add a polygon to a map", do they mean like precomputed polygon overlay? I need the user to be able to draw any shape onto the map, like a lasso tool
[16:25:47] <han-solo> Yeah, we use vector tile, but geojson works great if your dataset is small
[16:26:04] <han-solo> joakimk: https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/mapbox-gl-draw/

[16:28:15] *** Quits: mickey8 (~user@user/mickey) (Quit: Ping timeout (120 seconds))
[16:28:15] <han-solo> one idea is, when you draw a polygon, you will get the bounds, and you can send the bounds to backend, ...

[16:28:35] <joakimk> this is starting to seem like quite a possible feature ;)
[16:29:15] <joakimk> part 1) is to overlay the POIs onto the map. 2) draw an area and get the resulting filtered list of POIs
[16:29:22] <han-solo> let me think, maybe if you have the data in the client already, you could just select the POIs from the client itself
[16:29:33] <joakimk> yes
[16:29:36] <joakimk> sounds right
[16:30:07] <joakimk> so the user picks a part of the world, and gets a map of that region. Then we get all POIs with GPS coord, and overlay them on the map
[16:30:23] <joakimk> draw to select, and that all could run in the client/frontend (JS)
[16:31:41] <han-solo> joakimk: https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/queryrenderedfeatures-around-point/
[16:32:28] <han-solo> you can update that with, draw the polygon, get the bound and give it to `queryRenderedFeatures`, and it will return a featurelist, and then maybe you could highlight those

[19:16:40] <stenno> if err is a string, Promise.reject(err) will be Promise<String> i assume
[19:17:02] <stenno> are you not supposed to annotate rejection?
[19:17:12] <incognito> is sheetjs friend with the tableau guy ?
[19:17:23] <rowbots> so {undefined|Promise<String>}
[19:17:28] <samsch> Wouldn't `Promise<String>` imply a promise that *resolves* a string? Surely there's a different thing for the rejection type?
[19:17:44] <rowbots> @stenno, not sure im new to js
[19:17:49] <rowbots> re if supposed to annotate it
[19:17:59] <samsch> rowbots, fyi, I don't use TS, and I'm literally just making educated guesses
[19:18:28] <stenno> i see your point samsch
[19:18:29] <rowbots> im using js not typescript, but my editor gives me hints if i annotate types
[19:18:31] <samsch> You're using TS (or much less likely Flow) if you have to annotate it. JS doesn't have that.
[19:18:43] <samsch> So then still TS rules
[19:18:48] <rowbots> i dont have to
[19:20:20] <systemfault> Promise doesn't have a rejection type...

[21:48:20] <whatsupdoc> At this point I'm thinking why not drop all these tools and make a better programming language for the web

[21:51:56] <systemfault> You can't develop a huge application in a single file... so you need a way to develop by splitting your project into files and then create a single file package off them. That's why module bundlers exist.
[21:52:00] <stenno> you would just end up with a monolith comprised of those parts
[21:52:28] <systemfault> You want to support older browsers so you want to compile your JS to a version that is supported by all the browsers you need to support... So you want Babel
[21:52:47] <systemfault> TypeScript is totally optional... so you can skip it
[21:53:08] <systemfault> React could have its own JSX compiler... but why bother, Babel does it already with a plugin
[21:53:30] <whatsupdoc> It seems like other programming languages don't run into these issues as often

[22:54:48] <lantech19446> if I wanted to run some js in the browser would my only way of getting the results of my computations be to alert them or console.log them?

[23:00:50] <EdFletcher> lantech19446: you can just manipulate the DOM to add or update elements with your results, too
[23:02:48] <lantech19446> I was thinking without html to act on it would just be running whatever my code was in the background of a blank screen, are you saying I could create output into the browser anyway?
[23:04:44] <qswz> of course, that's what this page is doing got example: all output come from js https://caub.github.io/misc/calculator
[23:05:00] <EdFletcher> lantech19446: I'm not sure what you mean "without HTML", but if you're running in the browser there's a whole host of APIs for manipulating the document: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents
[23:05:40] <systemfault> Only the control allows to nicely inspect objects
[23:05:48] <systemfault> *console, not control
[23:06:21] <ario> how does console.log determine outputting [object Object] vs the actual object?
[23:07:02] <qswz> depends if you try to cast to string
[23:07:14] <qswz> n> {}+''
[23:07:16] <jellobot> (okay) 0
[23:07:21] <qswz> damn js
[23:07:40] <qswz> n> `${{}}`
[23:07:41] <jellobot> (okay) '[object Object]'
[23:09:22] <EdFletcher> in node it's using util.inspect with the default depth of 2, hence why anything at depth 2 or greater is just '[object Object]'. you can import and call inspect on your own specifying an infinite depth to get around that: https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#utilinspectobject-options
[23:09:44] <lantech19446> qswz: that's pretty cool, this is such a powerful language and I'm only at the very beginning of learning it I'm just trying to get a grasp on different ways it can be used
