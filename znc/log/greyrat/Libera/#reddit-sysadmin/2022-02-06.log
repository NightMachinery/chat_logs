[00:07:05] <PattyCakes> either way, it 100% involves piss - right?
[00:07:11] <DrGibby> without a doubt
[00:17:25] <AnonymooseReddtr> so i did a fail

[13:44:53] <Hunterkll> comes with a baller ass tuner
[13:45:53] <Azem> yeah it looks nice
[13:46:36] <Hunterkll> half tempted to make it my travel rig instead of the 7610 
[13:46:43] <Hunterkll> since it's already in a checkable luggage suitcase
[13:46:44] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:46:58] <Azem> do it
[13:46:59] <Hunterkll> though the 7610 fits inside my roll-on luggage 
[13:47:09] <Hunterkll> but like fuck am i checking a $3000 radio
[13:47:09] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:47:50] <Azem> $3000 ?!
[13:47:51] <Azem> fucking oof
[13:47:56] <Hunterkll> bah
[13:48:02] <Hunterkll> my fucking camera was $6500
[13:48:10] <Hunterkll> cameras make high end ham radio look cheap
[13:48:11] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:48:16] <Hunterkll> the 705 was $1300 
[13:48:22] <Azem> yeah they really do
[13:48:29] <Azem> what camera did you get ?
[13:48:42] <Hunterkll> FT-1000D I got used for $1200, FT-101 was free, SB-200 amplifier was $700, etc....
[13:48:49] <Hunterkll> Canon 1D X Mark III 
[13:49:01] <Hunterkll> the current  high end model 
[13:49:42] <Azem> god damn, that is one beast
[13:49:56] <Hunterkll> I slapped two 2TB  memory cards into it 
[13:49:57] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:50:15] <Azem> O_O
[13:50:17] <Azem> how much does camera take per photo ?
[13:50:34] <Hunterkll> check the spec sheet
[13:50:43] <Hunterkll> that'll store about 5 hours of raw 5.5K video tho 
[13:55:52] <Hunterkll> but yea, it uses NVMe storage lol
[13:55:57] <Hunterkll> each memory card was about $1k
[13:57:15] <Hunterkll> and yes, it already has scratches, dents, and god knows what in all corners of it
[14:01:57] <MOLNIJA> ... NVM Express... Camera ?
[14:02:07] <Hunterkll> yes....
[14:02:16] <Hunterkll> CF Express cards are just NVMe PCIe SSDs
[14:02:30] <Hunterkll> just like CF cards were just IDE SSDs, and CFast was SATA SSDs
[14:06:09] <MOLNIJA> I'm peaked on technology
[14:06:15] <MOLNIJA> return to PET
[14:07:10] <Hunterkll> MOLNIJA: keep in mind this is a device recording raw 4K and 5.5K video
[14:07:16] <Hunterkll> entirely uncompressed bitrates
[14:07:29] <MOLNIJA> okay, yes. NOW it makes sense.
[14:07:53] <Hunterkll> MOLNIJA: nevermind that it has a 1000+ frame buffer for 21MP raw images 
[14:07:57] <Hunterkll> that has to empty into somewhere
[14:08:03] <Hunterkll> and shoots more than 20fps+ 
[14:08:09] <Hunterkll> when in still mode
[14:08:23] <MOLNIJA> good lord. That's.. That's heartstopping
[14:09:16] <MOLNIJA> I also didn't know CF didn't die
[14:12:04] <Hunterkll> MOLNIJA: it's also a 1-series, so it can take a fuck of a beating
[14:12:19] <MOLNIJA> meow
[14:13:48] <Hunterkll> MOLNIJA: I actually cleaned it after doing beach photography to get the sand off.... by just running it under the faucet with the lens still affixed
[14:13:48] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:14:04] <MOLNIJA> That's ridiculous
[14:14:38] <Hunterkll> I can't use non-pro gear. I've once laid in a creek bed for 2 hours with water running around me to get one shot
[14:14:39] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:19:55] <MOLNIJA> oh wow
[14:20:07] <Hunterkll> that one was published in nat geo ;)
[14:20:45] <MOLNIJA> aha
[14:21:10] <Hunterkll> yea so the 5.5K RAW bitrate is about 760mbps
[14:21:19] <Hunterkll> or 5507MB/min 
[14:21:22] <MOLNIJA> too fast for sata
[14:21:39] <MOLNIJA> unless you have like a fuckoff raid stripe
[14:21:57] <Hunterkll> can do about 3 hours per TB 
[14:22:03] <Hunterkll> so about 9 hours, apparently
[14:22:07] <Hunterkll> unless I do 60fps
[14:22:14] <Hunterkll> which is 1.5 hours per TB
[14:22:23] <Hunterkll> at 1500mbit / 10860MB/minute
[14:22:41] <MOLNIJA> jesus fuck, 1.5 gigabit... just for video...
[14:22:55] <Hunterkll> 5.5K uncompressed raw footage
[14:22:56] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:23:12] <MOLNIJA> the price filmmakers pay for our 4k TV
[14:24:05] <Hunterkll> oh 4K is just 940mbit / 6734MB/min
[14:24:25] <Hunterkll> I can also do 1920x1080 at 120fps
[14:24:39] <Hunterkll> which is merely 360mbit/2586MB/min
[14:25:12] <Hunterkll> MOLNIJA: if i do CLOG mode, the 60fps 5.5K jumps up to 2600mbit / 18711MB/min
[14:25:36] <MOLNIJA> CLOG?
[14:25:43] <Hunterkll> so essentially, just about ... 3 hours of raw footage
[14:25:46] <Hunterkll> canon log format
[14:25:52] <Hunterkll> HEVC/H.265
[14:25:56] <MOLNIJA> aha,.
[14:26:16] <MOLNIJA> this is insane...
[14:26:34] <Hunterkll> well, it didn't cost $6500 for no reason :P

[14:30:00] <Hunterkll> well
[14:30:07] <Hunterkll> i can shoot 8-bit regular or 10-bit "HDR"
[14:30:18] * MOLNIJA drools
[14:31:01] <Hunterkll> it's my first digital camera :D
[14:31:14] <Hunterkll> before then, I was shooting two EOS-3 bodies 
[14:31:21] <Hunterkll> one loaded color, one loaded B&W
[14:31:53] <MOLNIJA> I'm gonna have a heart attack now thanks
[14:32:29] <Hunterkll> MOLNIJA: did i mention the built in wifi, GPS, and gigabit ethernet jack?
[14:32:49] <MOLNIJA> what is even the point of living anymore
[14:33:06] <Hunterkll> Oh, and since it's pro-series, the compatibility with all my accessories i've been using on EOS pro bodies that came out 25+ years ago?
[14:33:36] <MOLNIJA> think i'm gonna go die now
[14:34:10] <Hunterkll> did i mention the part where someone had one of these in their bag, and it went offboard on a boat, and the canon was the only survivor?
[14:34:19] <Hunterkll> the sonys all died a watery death 
[14:34:25] <Hunterkll> but canon was like "sup bro"
[14:35:35] <MOLNIJA> I can ill afford a 5 year old computer that'd struggle to encode your camera's output into lossy hevc, let alone the camera itself

[14:41:49] <MOLNIJA> $440 computer part credit card bill was a shocker

[23:51:48] <monr0e> Oh
[23:51:51] <monr0e> right over my head
[23:52:01] <sd> 13<lâ€‹2ksolkov> *looks over at windows 2000 server*
[23:52:04] <monr0e> I'm not really thinking tbh I'm tucking in to sausages
[23:52:06] <sd> 13<lâ€‹2ksolkov> *hides*
[23:52:46] <Cl0udNinja> @l2ksolkov at a place I worked we had a customer who still had a windows 2000 server, EXPOSED TO THE INTERNET
[23:52:56] <sd> 13<lâ€‹2ksolkov> Cl0udNinja: what the fuck
[23:53:09] <Cl0udNinja> this was maybe 7-8 years ago or so, but yeah...
[23:53:15] <sd> 13<lâ€‹2ksolkov> i mean ours is on our general data lan but its only on for as long as someone needs it(10 minutes max)
[23:53:50] <monr0e> A local authority I worked for at win2k machines still facing the internet, running business critical web applications, as of 2013
[23:53:52] <Cl0udNinja> lol yeah this shit was on for years when I got there. I think it had one of the highest uptimes
[23:55:51] <sd> 13<lâ€‹2ksolkov> im slightly upset all of our hardware is no longer supported in esxi 7
[23:55:54] <Cl0udNinja> it was one of the most ridiculous things I ever saw. I look in the CRM, see "Windows 2000", and I'm like 'nah that had to be a misclick, it cant possibly be'. sure enough..
[23:55:55] <sd> 13<lâ€‹2ksolkov> it's stupid but what can you do
[23:56:42] <Cl0udNinja> thats really stupid. I get that you can only support and test so much hardware, but I've heard that even from where I work now, that we cant upgrade to 7 without getting new hardware
[23:57:44] <sd> 13<lâ€‹2ksolkov> our hardware is from like 2014
[23:57:55] <sd> 13<lâ€‹2ksolkov> its good hardware
[23:58:19] <Cl0udNinja> ours is newer than that, still now unsupported
[23:58:32] <sd> 13<lâ€‹2ksolkov> i mean we *purchased* it in 2014
[23:58:35] <sd> 13<lâ€‹2ksolkov> i dont know when it came out
[23:59:39] <sd> 13<lâ€‹2ksolkov> came out in 2012
[23:59:55] <sd> 13<lâ€‹2ksolkov> wow
