[02:30:07] <cbreak> when I log in on my mac with it, it asks me for the pin too instead of the password. (It's annoying, I should disable it)
[02:30:39] <TortillaSandwich> on ubuntu's login, it's basically input password > press enter > hope you move faster than the time out clock
[02:30:43] <TortillaSandwich> no dialogue, no prompt
[02:31:24] <cbreak> how does the ubuntu login work? Via the smartcard interface?
[02:31:31] <TortillaSandwich> not even that
[02:31:41] <cbreak> that's what OS X login uses
[02:31:41] <TortillaSandwich> it's just the standard login, when you hit enter you need to insert the yubikey and press the button
[02:31:52] <cbreak> weird.
[02:32:39] <TortillaSandwich> yeah, and it does work cos if you don't interact with the yubikey it kicks back and says invalid password
[02:32:49] <TortillaSandwich> in windows you are met with a Yubikey lock page, and prompted to insert it
[02:33:09] <TortillaSandwich> its a minor detail, but sometimes I'm not fast enough... Im old lol

[07:39:33] <Joel> ubuntu 20, Wifi lost connection, sitting at a prompt asking me to re-enter the password. Though I have the password saved, and it didn't change. I entered the password, still didn't connect. I then had to select the wireless network again, and then it connected. I have it selected as priorty 0 for auto connect. Any recommendations on what I can read to help me set it so it never stops trying to reconnect? I especially don't get why it asks for a password reprompt.

I was going through some instructions to build amarok from git source (from the current tree), and there were some $PATH variables I had placed at the end of the .bashrc file, then ran that source command.  Well, after looking around a bit, I realized that these instructions might be dated.

[09:56:01] <weq> it works as expected now, but it is a setup script that makes indepented certs with certbot.
[09:56:26] <weq> so I take parts of the hostname and append our domain to get the FQDN so I can make the letsencrypt challenge.
[09:57:46] <klausfiend> which parts of the hostname?
[09:57:51] <weq> I have a bunch of demo environments that we spin up all as their independent sites. So terraform + ubuntu + docker + letsencrypt + our applications = full demo site

[17:23:49] <devios> leftyfb, thanks.  i see how to manually set the nameservers for a specific wifi network, but how do i make it so i use specific nameservers regardless of wifi network, and make that setting survive reboots.
[17:24:33] <leftyfb> devios: you don't
[17:25:14] <beuys> devios: Have a look in /etc/resolv.conf
[17:25:35] <leftyfb> beuys: that file will always get overwritten
[17:26:23] <ogra> any answer that includes /etc/resolv.conf is nowadays in 99% of the cases the wrong answer to resolution issues
[17:27:00] <leftyfb> devios: I do not think there is a way to always use the same nameserver across any and all networks, while also ignoring whatever nameserver gets assigned via DHCP
[17:27:37] <beuys> leftyfb: Take a look at the comment in /etc/resolv.conf. It says replacing it with a static file gives you control over it.

[17:37:06] <jmiahjones> devios: A somewhat fragile way involves adding the nameserver config to either head or tail in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/. This appends the config to the generated /etc/resolv.conf. That way you don't have to control the resolv.conf file completely.
