[06:55:11] <Rockwood> jargon, your question's answer is in --> https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-match-all.php
[06:55:21] <IIXenonII> so im using CE Phoenix as the commerce platform for our consulting business. I'm not very good with php and im having some trouble changing the way emails are sent. Right now the email sent that contains the forms needed to fill out are sent through an order update, so when we physically update the order to processing, thats when they receive the
[06:55:21] <IIXenonII> email with the forms they have to fill out, and later down the road this is going to cause problems. I tried adding the text to the checkout notification, however that breaks the entire checkout process. Looking at how the notification is handled on the backend, the difference is pretty vast from the looks of it and im unsure of how to go about
[06:55:22] <IIXenonII> fixing this. Basically I need the n_checkout.php to allow me to add the forms to the email like the n_update_order.php allows me to do.
[06:55:29] <IIXenonII> ill send code shortly sec
[06:55:43] <Rockwood> wait plz
[06:56:01] <Rockwood> use gist for paste code dont paste here directly
[06:56:13] <IIXenonII> okay
[06:58:54] <Rockwood> show the code plz

[07:51:17] <Blondie101010> making trk_is_valid() is good, though it still has the awful code
[07:51:22] <jargon> The other night when I was in here, it was only performing the second occurance.
[07:51:24] <Blondie101010> that's a tiny step in the right direction

[19:32:10] <__adrian> s/laso/also/
[19:33:12] <dimi1947> can identification be accomplished by just setting the client to perform sasl auth?
[19:33:26] <__adrian> yes
[19:33:29] <dimi1947> or do I have to use the command every time?
[19:33:50] <dimi1947> ok...than..will implememnt sasl
[19:37:01] <Naktibalda> nucc1: why do you execute another program which executes another program?
[19:37:18] <nucc1> you need to be setuid ROOT
[19:37:19] <__adrian> yo dawg
[19:37:57] <nucc1> Naktibalda: to list firewall rules, you have to be root, and afaik, it has to be a program, not a script for you to assign setuid root
[19:38:09] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[19:38:23] <nucc1> would be awfully convenient if i could simply execute "nft list ruleset -j" from php.
[19:39:51] <Naktibalda> yes, you can, but you must execute script as executable, and not pass it to php as parameter
[19:40:20] <Naktibalda> ./script.php   and it must start with #!/usr/bin/php
[19:40:34] <nucc1> i'm trying to build a web UI for my homebrew router
[19:40:51] <nucc1> so the web user will have to execute some other program anyway
[19:41:29] <nucc1> i am happy to explore that angle, but do you think that's the problem?
[19:41:49] <nucc1> if i execute the C program on the CLI, the output is as expected
[19:42:06] <nucc1> so it seems that either popen() in PHP is not reading all the output, or is getting confused by something in the output.

[19:45:18] <onizu> well
[19:46:16] <onizu> this is returning only 1 row I think
[19:46:53] <nucc1> are you calling fetchAll() ?
[19:47:24] <onizu> FETCH_CLASS
[19:47:35] <onizu> or FETCH_ASSOC
[19:48:10] <nucc1> FETCH_CLASS is a mode
[19:48:21] <nucc1> you need to combine that with FETCH_GROUP
[19:48:51] <nucc1> e.g $pdo->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_CLASS | PDO::FETCH_GROUP) ... something like that.
[19:49:00] <nucc1> i haven't tested that code of course.
[19:49:19] <nucc1> if you call fetch(), you only get one row.
[19:49:41] <onizu> 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE col IN (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?) -- like this
[19:49:55] <nucc1> don't use select *
[19:50:00] <onizu> yea i know
[19:50:07] <nucc1> provide an example please.
[19:50:19] <onizu> that was an example
[19:50:40] <da_wunder> use eg. 3v4l.org for your example - show there what you get now and provide an example what you want to get
[19:50:48] <onizu> $pdo->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_CLASS | PDO::FETCH_GROUP)   -- what's that second param after |
[19:51:09] <nucc1> onizu: https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.fetch.php
[19:51:14] <nucc1> it's a PDO fetch mode.
[19:51:17] <nucc1> there are many
[19:52:17] <nucc1> to get the output keyed by a particular column, you need the mode that is called FETCH_GROUP, or FETCH_KEY_PAIR. There are some differences between the two, and these are well explained on the PHP delusions website.
[19:52:38] <nucc1> you can combine multiple modes by using the (bitwise? ) operator and listing many of them.
[19:53:06] <nucc1> so in your example, you want to FETCH_CLASS *AND* FETCH_GROUP, then you combine them with a pipe symbol
[19:53:15] <nucc1> bitwise OR operator.
[19:53:38] <da_wunder> onizu: eg. if you use `SELECT table.columnThatYouWantToUseWithGroup, * FROM table WHERE col IN (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)` and then that $pdo->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_CLASS | PDO::FETCH_GROUP) - you should get a result like ['foo' => [...], 'bar', => [...]] where those `foo` and `bar` keys are from `table.columnThatYouWantToUseWithGroup` column and result is an array of your objects where that matches
[19:54:21] <da_wunder> assuming that I remember that syntax correctly
[19:54:30] <nucc1> also important, you're not gonna get the grouping if you fetch only one result :), because there's nothing to group
[19:55:25] <onizu> da_wunder: ok, but what if I want to select multiple columns?
[19:55:37] <nucc1> the key is always the first column.
[19:55:43] <onizu> hmm
[19:55:54] <nucc1> read the examples on that page
[19:55:59] <onizu> we can't specify which column to key with?
[19:56:10] <nucc1> you specify the column by placing it first.
[19:56:10] <__adrian> onizu: you can
[19:56:14] <__adrian> but not when you SELECT *
[19:56:19] <__adrian> select the key column first
[19:56:35] <nucc1> if you also need the key column in the output, simply repeat it later on.
[19:56:49] <onizu> so SELECT columnToKeyWith, col2, col3  WHERE... like this?
[19:56:50] <nucc1> you can do "SELECT id, id FROM students" in SQL, if i recall correctly.
[19:57:25] <onizu> nucc1: oh so the key column is not included in the result unless repeated?
[19:57:34] <nucc1> the key column is in the results
[19:57:35] <nucc1> as a key
[19:57:46] <onizu> but not as value
[19:58:51] <onizu> I want the result like:     userID => [ 'userID' => userID, 'name' => name, ...]
[19:59:41] <nucc1> i have nothing more to add.
[20:00:22] <da_wunder> then something like `SELECT id AS userId, id AS userId, name FROM user` and then `->fetchAll(FETCH_ASSOC | FETCH_GROUP);`
[20:00:53] <__adrian> no need to alias the first one
[20:00:59] <onizu> ok
[20:01:04] <da_wunder> oh, true
[20:01:20] <onizu> thanks
[20:03:46] <da_wunder> and you can do `SELECT id, id, id ...` - http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/60e7d5/2

[20:11:02] <da_wunder> that userid?
[20:11:14] <onizu> what's the numeric value for FETCH_GROUP? (like 8 for FETCH_CLASS, 2 for FETCH_ASSOC)

[20:12:28] <TML> var_dump(PDO::FETCH_GROUP);
[20:12:34] <da_wunder> why not just use plain old FETCH_ASSOC and then just `$user = array_filter($users, fn($x): bool => $x['id'] = 123);` ?
[20:12:57] <onizu> TML:  well.. I need to select a specific array by the key and then also need cycle through that array and use the key=>val pair again.. (I know it can be avoided.. but have some old code)
[20:13:01] <da_wunder> that FETCH_GROUP is usually used if when you want to _group_ those users by like gender etc.
[20:14:07] <__adrian> "onizu> what's the numeric value for FETCH_GROUP?"   **DO NOT USE** the value. use the constant. that's what it's for.
[20:14:16] <onizu> da_wunder: that becomes a overhead (to cycle through the result to re-key it) if the result is large
[20:14:46] <onizu> __adrian: " A non-numeric value encountered in ..."
[20:15:25] <TML> onizu: What version of PHP are you using?
[20:15:26] <__adrian> onizu:  function ($row) { yield $row['id'] => $row; }
[20:15:28] <onizu>        $statement->fetchAll($fetchMode|$fetchModeSecond);
[20:15:40] <onizu> TML: 7.x
[20:15:49] <__adrian> onizu: that is,  function ($rows) { foreach ($rows as $row) { yield $row['id'] => $row; } }
[20:16:39] <da_wunder> onizu: try to understand that we don't know your actual use case - so cannot really say what you're saving if you have an array like `[123 => ['id' => 123, ...], 321 => ['id' => 321, ...]` versus `[['id' => 123, ..], ['id' => 321, ...]]`
[20:16:52] <__adrian> though agree there no reason to not let pdo do it
[20:17:24] <onizu> __adrian:  that's what I had been doing so far.. but I wondered if the db could return the result with a desired key , to avoid that cycling through the resulting array
[20:17:25] <__adrian> also not sure how the array_filter example above fits in. if you're filtering db results it means you probably need to fix your WHERE clause

[20:20:16] <__adrian> NO
[20:20:22] <TML> onizu: Did you spell it correctly?
[20:20:22] <__adrian> you need to use  PDO::FETCH_GROUP

[20:21:06] <onizu> yes
[20:21:15] <__adrian> and if you misspelled, then you need to fix your error reporting settings - that produces a warning
[20:21:54] <onizu> and passing in quotes
[20:22:00] <TML> yeah, you can set error_reporting to tell you about use of undefined constants
[20:22:05] <TML> lol
[20:22:21] <__adrian> right, do not quote it. "quotes make strings"

[20:25:16] <__adrian> ^^
[20:25:28] <__adrian> don't use the plain value. use the constant.
[20:25:47] <onizu> ok
[20:25:57] <da_wunder> those are constants always use those, not the values
[20:26:29] <da_wunder> but if you really want know what the value is, look php.net website or just simple var_dump - https://3v4l.org/IEmJl
[20:26:57] <__adrian> if SOME_CONST was 7 in one version of php, and then was 88 in the next version, that's completely fine because *nobody* should be using the value - everybody should be writing   SOME_CONST  in their code.
[20:27:13] <da_wunder> ^
[20:27:14] <__adrian> the value is completely meaningless.
