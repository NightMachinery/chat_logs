[08:32:36] <muaddib[m]> I have a question about synchronizing start times in gr-uhd. Is anyone online who can help me? drmpeg  patchvonbraun ?

[08:39:00] <drmpeg> I am not an expert on it, but just set Sync to something besides "No Sync".
[08:39:22] <muaddib[m]> good advice. 
[08:39:50] <drmpeg> Unknown PPS seems to work.
[08:40:14] <muaddib[m]> ok. Then I must be doing something wrong. 
[08:40:29] <drmpeg> TX or RX?
[08:40:36] <muaddib[m]> TX
[08:41:19] <drmpeg> I only have a B210 here. I think you're using a N321 or something?
[08:41:27] <muaddib[m]> yea
[08:43:04] <drmpeg> I guess no matter what, you'll need to verify things with a oscope or some other external instrument.
[08:43:31] <muaddib[m]> right. my test setup is an N321 running into a Keysight ENA590$$$ VNA. I'm following a keysight recommended procedure to take relative phase measurements
[08:43:57] <jholtom> muaddib[m]: I do it a lot in standalone stuff
[08:44:32] <jholtom> Works great for me on my N320
[08:44:57] <drmpeg> On the B210, if I set Unknown PPS, I get some extra messages.
[08:45:01] <drmpeg> [INFO] [MULTI_USRP]     1) catch time transition at pps edge

[08:46:01] <muaddib[m]> Here's the thing.

[08:48:23] <muaddib[m]> If i use the UHD Python API to generate a sinusoid with the following params:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/16051215356160a79587cdf4341676898312aedc)
[08:49:08] <muaddib[m]> then run the 'send_waveform' command (convenience function from multi-usrp.py) 
[08:49:38] <muaddib[m]> I have a math operator on the VNA that shows channel 2 over channel 1 relative mag/phase
[08:49:48] <muaddib[m]> * channel 1 (relative mag/phase, * relative mag/phase)
[08:49:58] <muaddib[m]> the thing looks like a freaking laser beam
[08:50:02] <muaddib[m]> straight as an arrow
[08:50:17] <muaddib[m]> all the lights come on like a festivus pole 
[08:50:37] <muaddib[m]> and the world is at HIGHLY accurate phase stability 
[08:51:27] <drmpeg> But you can't do that in GRC?
[08:52:08] <muaddib[m]> nope!
[08:52:08] <muaddib[m]> If I set (what i THINK are) the equivalent parameters in gr-uhd, the mag/phase are going all over the place. I go from +-.5deg with the python API to +- 50deg
[08:53:01] <drmpeg> Did you try setting the start time to something positive?
[08:53:27] <muaddib[m]> that's what I was thinking. I did do that. but I just set it to 1 I think
[08:53:57] <muaddib[m]> I vaguely remember someone talking about something similar to this on the boards with RFNoC.
[08:55:22] <drmpeg> You can look at the generated .py file and see if the UHD commands make some sense.
[08:56:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> Thing is a multi-channel usrp sink should NOT have mutual phase noise going into the same USRP regardless of start time.
[08:56:56] *** Joins: superkuh (~superkuh@user/superkuh)
[08:59:04] <muaddib[m]> meaning I shouldn't send the same thing to 2 channels or you're saying what I'm seeing is wrong?
[08:59:22] <muaddib[m]> (shouldn't happen?)
[08:59:31] <patchvonbraun[m]> There’s no reason for you to be seeing what you’re seeing
[08:59:45] <muaddib[m]> right
[08:59:46] <jholtom> muaddib[m]: I do this with RFNoC all the time
[09:00:10] <jholtom> Basically just call graph.synchronize_times and then send with a positive timestamp
[09:00:48] <patchvonbraun[m]> A two channel usrp sink into the same usrp should be fairly tight. Maybe some phase offset but certainly not gross phase noise between the two channels.
[09:01:32] <jholtom> Yeah....
[09:01:39] <jholtom> Seems like the synch commands aren't occuring
[09:02:10] <muaddib[m]> I should add that I successfully exposed the LO distribution board port enable from gr-uhd
[09:03:10] <muaddib[m]> I also used pybind to expose that to a python call in gr-uhd, then put it in as a snippet
[09:03:20] <patchvonbraun[m]> Even without shared LO the synthesizers will be getting a shared clock. They’ll still have reasonable mutual phase noise but may have phase offset.
[09:03:21] <muaddib[m]> if i turn that off I see basically no difference
[09:03:34] <muaddib[m]> right, that's what I figured. 
[09:04:18] <muaddib[m]> jholtom: do you call graph.synchronize from GRC or do you call all of this in Python/C++?
[09:04:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> Unfortunately I don’t have an N321 so I can’t test scenarios.
[09:05:34] <muaddib[m]> NI needs to send you one. you're like the only person who really answers questions besides other community members.
[09:05:57] <muaddib[m]> I sent them an email last Friday, still haven't heard anything
[09:06:48] <patchvonbraun[m]> funkylab also. But he puts in fewer hours than I do.
[09:07:18] <muaddib[m]> yea that's right. i've seen him putting out some really helpful stuff too.

[09:16:12] <muaddib[m]> <---Redneck with a degree who knows how to point a Yagi
[09:18:11] <muaddib[m]> So, i'm using UHD 4.1 I guess there could be some weirdness going on there. There's a depreciation warning I believe. 
[09:19:57] <patchvonbraun[m]> Possible something is off between gr-UHD and recent UHDs.
[09:20:23] <muaddib[m]> yea, like maybe theres a start message not getting sent.
[09:20:46] <patchvonbraun[m]> Like I said. That shouldn’t matter.
[09:21:45] <patchvonbraun[m]> Particularly given yuur simple test care of a COS function.
[09:21:56] <muaddib[m]> yea, no kidding
[09:22:48] <muaddib[m]> i'm pretty happy that i've at least seen it work with the UHD API. Now i've narrowed it down to either a gr-uhd issue or a layer 0 issue
[09:22:51] <patchvonbraun[m]> If you move the baseband tone up to 2Khz is it better or worse?
[09:23:57] <muaddib[m]> idk. i'll try that when I get on tomorrow.
[09:24:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> Just thinking something with the DC offset removal algorithm
[09:24:39] <muaddib[m]> ah gotcha
[09:24:57] <muaddib[m]> yea, the simple case also happens to look like a DC spike 
[09:25:07] <muaddib[m]> (at 1khz
[09:25:10] <muaddib[m]>  * (at 1khz)
[09:26:06] <patchvonbraun[m]> I don’t know what the bandwidth of the DC removal algorithm is. But certainly 1khz with a 100Mhz bandwidth smells like DC
[09:26:41] <muaddib[m]> I'll try moving it way up. like a MHz and see what that does as well
[09:27:17] <muaddib[m]> again though, it works with the API, so that should also use the same on-board DC correction right?

[13:57:15] <mobizmn[m]> I know that they are warnings, but why am I getting them?
[13:59:15] <drmpeg> Those are just Doxygen warnings.
[13:59:54] <mobizmn[m]> I realized that I hadnt checkout to the 3.9 branch.
[14:00:25] <drmpeg> The iir_filter warnings have been around forever.
[14:00:32] <mobizmn[m]> So I thought that I got those warnings because of that. So I removed my message. 😅
[14:00:48] <mobizmn[m]> But yeah, the warning is still there
[14:01:06] <mobizmn[m]> I installing 3.8 a little while ago, and I dont think I got it then
[14:01:34] <drmpeg> They are pybind11 related, so 3.9 and after.
[14:01:39] <mobizmn[m]> One more thing, I got this on make test

[14:01:48] <mobizmn[m]> No tests were found!!!
[14:02:32] <mobizmn[m]> If there are no tests, then I guess this line should be removed from the installation documentation.
[14:02:54] <drmpeg> No, somethings wrong.
[14:03:35] <drmpeg> Lemme do a build here.
[14:04:32] <mobizmn[m]> Maybe I missed something. I also run gnuradio-companion. So it probably wasn't added to the path
[14:04:41] <mobizmn[m]> * I also couldn't run gnuradio-companion.
[14:06:04] <mobizmn[m]> And while installing 3.8, it took a LOT of time, but the commands of 3.9 finished running in a few seconds.
[14:07:54] <drmpeg> You may have built 3.10 by mistake without spdlog.

[14:10:33] <drmpeg> make sure you do:
[14:10:48] <drmpeg> git checkout maint-3.9
[14:12:11] <drmpeg> Without spdlog, there's nothing to build and nothing to test.
[14:12:25] <drmpeg> and nothing to install.
[14:12:48] <drmpeg> Because all of GNU Radio depends on spdlog.
[14:13:45] <mobizmn[m]> Can you explain what exactly spdlog is?
[14:14:41] <drmpeg> It's the new logging framework in 3.10
[14:14:57] <drmpeg> sudo apt-get install libspdlog-dev
[14:15:45] <drmpeg> Then you can build 3.10 or the default main branch.
[14:16:09] <drmpeg> Not required for 3.9 though.
[14:17:10] <drmpeg> When you do the cmake step, always check the enabled components.
[14:17:12] <mobizmn[m]> Ok, I will install from scratch again and then see what happens
[14:17:35] <drmpeg> Yes.

[14:40:17] <drmpeg> Ok, I know what's wrong.
[14:40:42] <drmpeg> Linux Mint is just Ubuntu with a different UI.
[14:40:56] <drmpeg> You're missing pybind11.
[14:42:16] <drmpeg> sudo apt-get install pybind11-dev
[14:42:51] <mobizmn[m]> Ok, I installed it. Let me check the output again
[14:43:08] <drmpeg> You don't have to re-clone every time.
[14:43:26] <drmpeg> Just rm -rf the build directory.

[14:56:29] <mobizmn[m]> I wonder if 3.8 will give the same issues in linux mint
[14:56:54] <drmpeg> There's nothing special about Linux Mint.
[14:57:05] <drmpeg> It's Ubuntu.

[15:01:20] <drmpeg> sudo apt-get install pybind11-dev

[20:12:09] <patchvonbraun[m]> So, you can specify the master_clock in the device arguments "master_clock_rate=200e6"  which will eliminate weird sample-rate conversion.
[20:12:33] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yeah, Iv'e heard others complain that N32x cannot recover well from long strings of UU and Ls

[20:19:15] <patchvonbraun[m]> muaddib: And to be clear, you're seeing phase *NOISE* (that is, A and B "dancing around" each other?) as opposed to a simple phase *OFFSET*?
[20:23:31] <muaddib[m]> correct
[20:23:32] <muaddib[m]> this is relative between the channels
[20:27:26] <patchvonbraun[m]> Do you see the same thing if you DONT try to use LO sharing?
[20:28:17] <warnes[m]> I need some help getting my bladeRF xA9 properly tuned so I can send a signal out over a loopback + attenuator and read it back in cleanly. Right now I’m getting a huge amount of noise when I do so. 
[20:28:17] <warnes[m]> For example, in a FM Tx --> loopback cable + 20db attentuator -> Rx, I can do clear FM reception of local stations, but can only get very noise Rx from the TX channel.
[20:30:57] <patchvonbraun[m]> warnes: I suspect that you may be overloading the RX.   Add another 20-30dB of attenuation.  Remember, you're tying to simulate path loss in an ordinary antenna-based channel.   In that domain, -60dBm is pretty darned loud.
[20:31:31] <muaddib[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: yes
[20:31:50] <patchvonbraun[m]> Also put a Qt Frequency sink in the path after your source block--how big is the spectral peak?  Is it distorted.
[20:33:02] <patchvonbraun[m]> muaddib: If you pre-generate a signal and place it in a RAMdisk file, and then use that as your source instead of the signal source, does that change things?

[20:36:13] <patchvonbraun[m]> warnes: but still, what does your input spectrum look like?  That can often be really helpful in debugging these problems.

[20:56:23] <patchvonbraun[m]> Looks like the labels on your time sink are wrong--the blue and red are acually the I/Q of the TX side.

[21:02:42] <muaddib[m]> re-ran my pure UHD script to rule out environmentals. pure UHD is stable inside of 1deg
[21:04:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> I would expect shared-LO to be under 1DEG, and shared-ref synthesizers to be worse than that by a small factor.
[21:05:13] <patchvonbraun[m]> warnes: OK, so you're going to need to play with RX and TX gain levels to get the SNR you need for the demod.  Your existing SNR on the RX looks pretty good.
[21:06:00] <muaddib[m]> I would too. That's what NI/Ettus is getting in their internal tests as well.

[21:19:39] <patchvonbraun[m]> muaddib: If you have a sig-gen in the lab, you could use THAT as your actual LO source, and split it to the two channels.  If it's STILL wobbly after that, then that's another piece of sleuthing data.

[22:00:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yeah, there are 3 switchable filters.  The LO filters will follow whatever tuning commands you issue.  But what you CANNOT do is send a tune command for one frequency, then switch your external generator over to a new ferquency in a different band and expect it to work.  
[22:01:27] <muaddib[m]> right, how would it know
[22:02:11] <patchvonbraun[m]> Not sure which USRP models have switchable LO filters, but it's something to be aware of when using an external generator for debugging.
[22:05:00] <muaddib[m]> yes, thank you. for sure
[22:05:29] <muaddib[m]> I quickly tried that a few days ago and i saw no real change, so i must've been doing something wrong
[22:07:32] <patchvonbraun[m]> There IS an LO amplififer in the chain, so you may be able to use lower input levels.
[22:08:07] <patchvonbraun[m]> Although if you were measuring a few dBm on the outputs of the distriubtion panel, you should try to match that.
[22:08:16] <muaddib[m]> In a general sense,  am I biasing the measurement by using the same reference when measuring the USRP?
[22:08:16] <muaddib[m]> since the reference clock just gives a generic reference to the PLL's in both the USRP and the VNA i'd think they make their own decisions
