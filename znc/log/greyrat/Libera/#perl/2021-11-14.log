[02:24:13] <gordonfish> Is there a known module that gives a who(1) type list? Or something that tell me if and who is logged in as a local desktop user, under Linux (similar to w -h | grep -E '\<tty[0-9]+\s+:0\>' | cut -d' ' -f1; which gets a tty user on :0 (also thought about checking tty7, but that isn't necessarily guarenteed to be 7, even if it almost always is.)
[02:27:18] <gordonfish> I could just parse who or w like above, but I'm wondering if there is a better, more reliable, sensible, and safer (and more programmatic) method to just tell who is logged in at the main desktop from a perl script.

[02:58:08] <sivoais> gordonfish: Proc::ProcessTable
[03:00:51] <gordonfish> sivoais: Thanks will look at that. Was about to say I found a module called User::Utmp that lets one access the same info w/who does.
[03:00:58] <simcop2387> gordonfish: if you want to know which sessions and such, modern linux uses loginctl. loginctl -o json -a
[03:01:32] <simcop2387> [{"session":"4","uid":1000,"user":"ryan","seat":"seat0","tty":""}]
[03:01:44] <simcop2387> that'll properly catch wayland sessions too
[03:02:03] <sivoais> ooh, that's neat, TIL
[03:02:10] <gordonfish> Nice
[03:02:31] <simcop2387> and there's me logged in via ssh too: [{"session":"22","uid":1000,"user":"ryan","seat":"","tty":"pts/8"},{"session":"4","uid":1000,"user":"ryan","seat":"seat0","tty":""}]
[03:03:02] <gordonfish> (was going to say grep { $_->{ut_type} == 7 && $_->{ut_line} =~ /^tty/ } getut; appears to get what I needed, but I'll look at loginctl -o json -a now
[03:03:04] <gordonfish> )
[03:03:10] <simcop2387> the nice part is that it'll do it by session and not just pty/tty.  so someone with 4000000000 terminals open doesn't fill it all
[03:03:28] <simcop2387> but if they're logged in multiple times it'll show it
[03:04:26] <simcop2387> it'll also properly handle multi-seat computers but really, when does that ever happen anymore
[03:04:47] <gordonfish> Yeah looks like loginctl is what I needed. Thanks a lot.
[03:06:02] <gordonfish> (loginctl -o json -a --no-pager)
[03:06:04] <simcop2387> yea i'm not entirely sure how a wayland session will end up in who() actually now that i think about it.  kde's wayland sessions are *almost* there for me to use it.  still some small random crashes with multi-monitor support but there was just a set of fixes that went into that again for the next release so i'm hoping it'll be good
[03:07:47] <gordonfish> From what I can gather, 'seat0' is the primary desktop (which also has an empty 'tty' field.
[03:07:50] <gordonfish> )
[03:08:54] <simcop2387> yea, since X11 nor wayland use a tty

[03:09:20] <simcop2387> their relationship with virtual terminals and ttys are weird
[03:09:26] <gordonfish> simcop2387: Really? Because who and w list them in tty7

[03:11:05] <simcop2387> yea it's one of the really weird and stupid legacy things.  there's a tty allocated for the kernel vt, but it doesn't actually get used.  i remember reading how that all worked at one point and got a headache.  it's one reason why the kernel developers are actually looking to drop the old style virtual terminals and switch to kmscon eventually.
[03:11:30] <simcop2387> it's also why X11 used to get hung when you'd switch to a terminal (i'm not entirely sure what changed to make that stop happening)
[03:12:30] <simcop2387> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/KMSCON # for info on that
[03:12:31] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ KMSCON - ArchWiki ]
[03:12:58] <simcop2387> the multiseat support stuff is interesting
[03:14:44] <simcop2387> the main advantages are that it runs in userspace and thus can do hardware accelerated stuff for rendering text, and it can do more complicated fonts for those pesky non english languages.
[03:15:45] <gordonfish> Haven't heard about kmscon, will be good reading.
[03:16:01] <simcop2387> and you can get back the shift+pgup/shift+pgdn behavior that the 5.9 kernel removed (think it was 5.9).  that was apparently a huge hack that caused lots of maintenance headaches for the maintainers

[15:08:11] <Adura> So the only problem now is that it's slow?
[15:11:27] <Adura> \x92 could be \N{U+2018} instead.
[15:12:12] <xenu> cmp otoh *is* locale-aware but only if 'use locale' is in the scope and your locales aren't broken

[19:19:11] <tm604> ology: when does the construction of the name happen? if it's in a variable, then you're not going to get constant folding, but it's readily available in __PACKAGE__->$name
[19:22:54] <ology> tm604++ - Woo! That works. Thank you. :)
[19:23:04] <tm604> if it's not in a variable, you could do something like this, but it'd be a bit pointless:
[19:23:06] <tm604> sweval: use constant RPI_PIN_11 => 8; use constant target => do { no strict 'refs'; &{"RPI_PIN_" . 11} }; target
[19:23:08] <perlbot> tm604: 8

[19:29:22] <aquanight> actually with use constant, if you had some $pin you needed to get the corresponding constant for you could go: __PACKAGE__->can("RPI_PIN_$pin")->();
[19:30:11] <aquanight> that being said, if you do this a lot I might suggest instead creating a hash to do the lookup

[19:32:18] <tm604> if you're doing that a lot, switch off strict 'refs' and you can use &{"RPI_PIN_$pin"} as above

[19:33:30] <ology> hm
[19:34:10] <ology> I like how it is for my newbie hobbyist things for now...
[19:34:22] <tm604> (or there's __PACKAGE__->${\"RPI_PIN_$pin"}, which should work under strict 'refs')
[19:37:09] <Grinnz> create a hash ++
[19:37:24] <Grinnz> "i want a dynamic name" almost always means "i want a hash"
[19:37:49] <ology> There are 40 values. 
[19:37:50] <tm604> indeed, a hash or function for this would be a nice addition to the HiPi API
[19:38:01] <ology> yes
[19:38:20] *** Joins: TieUpYourCamel (~david@99-111-133-221.lightspeed.chrlnc.sbcglobal.net)
[19:38:23] <Grinnz> you can make that hash a "constant" (it won't actually make the contents constant) or readonly with ReadonlyX/Const::Fast (which will make it restricted so accessing the wrong name will error, which is actually what you want)

[19:40:06] <aquanight> you can have both
[19:41:15] <aquanight> it might be use constant \%pins;
[19:41:26] <aquanight> but whatever
[19:57:17] <aquanight> Grinnz: so... another thing different from utf8::*code vs Encode::. utf8:: is actually more perl's "interal utf8 like encoding for wide characters" than proper utf8
[19:57:34] <Grinnz> correct
[19:57:37] <aquanight> e.g. it has no problem with "characters" past U+10ffff
