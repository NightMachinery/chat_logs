[00:05:59] <matt|home> and people wonder why some people snap and shoot places up :\ im not going to do that, but jesus christ
[00:06:11] <matt|home> nothing makes a difference anymore
[00:06:20] <MootPoot> Imo the trick is to just constantly do it

[09:47:18] <amigojapan> Right. I am aware Nanobot
[09:47:23] <Nanobot> Or, more specifically, it takes your immune system about 2 weeks to adjust to the vaccine and develop the antibodies.

[10:33:59] <saganman> Nana*
[10:34:17] <amigojapan> saganman: they tagged it josei but it came out in ribbon which is a shoujo manga. But the contents is very adult themed
[10:34:29] <amigojapan> I am not sure
[10:35:21] <saganman> Not just the contents, the emotions and feels are too much.
[10:35:36] <amigojapan> saganman: they are supposed to tag it by what kind of magazine it was published in
[10:36:09] <amigojapan> saganman: the target audience
[10:37:02] <saganman> Yeah, I know but sometimes it gets tricky like with xxxholic
[10:37:45] <saganman> It switched between seinen and shounen couple of times I think.
[10:38:32] <amigojapan> saganman: you mean it was published in different magazines?

[10:41:47] <amigojapan> saganman: I think shounen magazines sell much better than seinen ones, so there is more incentive to publish in a shounen magazine
[10:42:02] <amigojapan> I see saganman 
[10:42:37] <saganman> Overall the series has more seinen feel though amigojapan

[10:45:55] <saganman> Oh yeah, sure. Marketing trick.
[10:46:03] <amigojapan> Yup
[10:46:11] <saganman> The problem with nana is bit tricky amigojapan.
[10:46:32] <amigojapan> Ok
[10:46:56] <saganman> Though it is published in shoujo manga the contents and the people it is aimed at are completely different.
[10:48:12] <saganman> To be honest adult female would like nana more than others.
[10:48:26] <saganman> But technically it is shoujo.
[10:48:38] <amigojapan> saganman: but it is a rule that the only thing that matters is which audience the manga is targeted to. You could say it has a josei Vive. But not tag it josei
[10:50:00] <saganman> Yeah, I get what you’re saying. I don’t understand how it was published in shoujo manga at first place. Which idiot thought nana is for young girls?
[10:50:57] <amigojapan> saganman: I think there are very few josei magazines and they are usually yon coma manga
[10:52:03] <saganman> Besides these websites like anidb and others are mostly used by non Japanese people who completely misunderstand these tags.
[10:52:07] <amigojapan> Yon koma
[10:52:53] <amigojapan> Right saganman but up to now, I had not seen an incorrectly tagged one
[10:54:15] <saganman> That’s good. I learned about these because of bakabt.

[14:13:52] <sharkwitch> you should watch whatever you are the most excited about
[14:14:11] <amigojapan> sharkwitch: I don't like the English name of chuunibyou. The Japanese title does not call love a "delusion"
[14:15:53] <sharkwitch> isn't it more like creating an imaginary character for yourself?
[14:16:11] <sharkwitch> maybe real to you and seen as a delusion by others
[14:16:37] <amigojapan> sharkwitch: love? 
[14:16:56] <sharkwitch> nooo
[14:17:11] <sharkwitch> what is the english title?
[14:17:43] <amigojapan> The English title it"love, chuunibyou and other delusions..."
[14:18:23] <amigojapan> The Japanese title is more like "even a chuunibyou wants to fall in love
[14:18:48] <sharkwitch> ah, it could be they don't mean that love is a delusion, but it's a weird title
[14:18:59] <amigojapan> Yup
[14:19:14] <amigojapan> It's a bad translation
[14:19:37] <sharkwitch> it has the word chuunibyou in it, which has no meaning in english
[14:20:24] <amigojapan> It has little meaning even in Japanese, it means middle school second grade disease
[14:20:36] <sharkwitch> right
[14:21:21] <sharkwitch> Chūnibyō (中二病) is a Japanese colloquial term typically used to describe early teens who have grandiose delusions, who desperately want to stand out, and who have convinced themselves that they have hidden knowledge or secret powers.
[14:21:39] <sharkwitch> delusions again
[14:22:23] <amigojapan> sharkwitch: but it is not a common word everyone knows
[14:23:28] <sharkwitch> I'm not quite that delusional
[14:23:47] <amigojapan> :)
[14:24:07] <amigojapan> I mean even Japanese people don't know it

[15:04:08] <Macer> amigojapan: i wish!
[15:04:09] <Macer> no
[15:04:15] <Macer> superhero movie on the DC side
[15:04:31] <Macer> WB has pretty much botched the entire DC side of the house lol
[15:04:34] <amigojapan> Ah ok Macer 
[15:04:41] <Macer> they need to hire the same people as marvel/disney
[15:04:43] <Macer> they do it right
[15:06:59] <amigojapan> Macer: the wonder woman movie was DC and was decent. I mean the first movie
[15:07:15] <Macer> it was OK
[15:07:21] <Macer> black widow was better :)
[15:07:37] <Macer> my problem with wonder woman was they obiously just made her do supermodel poses for the sake of doing it
[15:07:48] <Macer> we get it... she's hot... you don't have to have a model pose every other scene
[15:08:01] <Macer> it was one of the better movies tho
[15:08:04] <amigojapan> Macer: I doubt the writers for marvel would also write for DC
[15:08:09] <Macer> and joker was good but that was a different kind of movie
[15:08:31] <Macer> amigojapan: didn't the director of a marvel movie do the suicide squad (the new one not the will "fuck a movie up" smith one)
[15:08:53] <amigojapan> I have no idea Macer 
[15:08:56] <Macer> heh
[15:09:05] <Macer> but yah. compared to the marvel movies.. the DC ones are shit
[15:09:44] <amigojapan> Marvel had gotten better at making comedy hero movies. DC is now serious
[15:09:53] <amigojapan> Has*
[15:09:55] <Macer> DC has always been too serious
[15:10:05] <Macer> but they also keep sticking to that awkward goofy style
[15:10:12] <Macer> like in that wonder woman 1984 movie
[15:10:28] <Macer> fuck that was an awful movie
[15:10:29] <amigojapan> I did not watch that one yet
[15:10:32] <Macer> i couldn't even finish it
[15:10:39] <Macer> it was terrible
[15:11:05] <amigojapan> I see .I like retro things so it sounded good
[15:11:11] <Macer> what makes DC movies so bad is that they COULD HAVE been decent but the overall story just seems off... as though they kept rewriting it midstream
[15:11:40] <amigojapan> I see, maybe they did
[15:11:43] <Macer> WB should just sell that shit to disney :D haha
[15:11:54] <Macer> amigojapan: i know with justice league they had that snyder release 
[15:12:04] <Macer> which was better sure... but overall their universe is shit
[15:12:16] <Macer> it just did not mesh well across the movies
[15:12:29] <Macer> marvel was a bit fucked up earlier on but they sorted most of it out around iron man 3 heh
[15:12:35] <amigojapan> I see. I used to watch the 70s justice League cartoons
[15:12:47] <Macer> like nobody realizes that the ed norton hulk movie was the 2nd movie in that universe haha
[15:12:57] <Macer> amigojapan: the one where wonder woman had the invisible plane? lol
[15:13:26] <Macer> i mean why fly a real plane when you can just be a sitting superhero flying around?
[15:13:27] <amigojapan> Yeah, but she also had her own cartoon with invisible plane
[15:13:55] <Macer> i never understood the concept of the invisible plane... just some quick and easy make something seem cool sort of things
[15:14:04] <amigojapan> Macer: when I was a kid I just accepted it
[15:14:09] <Macer> yah haha
[15:14:25] <Macer> like he man never killing skeletor even though he had a thousand chances to do it and end the never ending war?
[15:14:56] <amigojapan> Macer: he man would never kill anyone
[15:15:05] <Macer> or adam west batman villans leaving him in some ridiculous trap and walking off to rob the bank while batman escapes
[15:15:16] <Macer> instead of just putting a bullet in his head
[15:16:17] <Macer> maybe DC will just reboot everything and start from scratch 
[15:16:22] <Macer> i'm sort of hoping disney does that with x-men
[15:16:27] <amigojapan> Macer: lots of old super heroes were against killing
[15:16:29] <Macer> since they own the x-men/mutant rights again
[15:16:36] <Macer> amigojapan: the villans weren't
[15:16:52] <Macer> but instead of just shooting the superhero in the head they just walk off 
[15:17:08] <amigojapan> Yeah, but the villans never won in those shows
[15:17:15] <Macer> like really... we couldn't make kryptonite bullets to kill superman?
[15:17:59] <Macer> DC also has that awkwardness with the whole arrowverse being a thing too
[15:18:10] <amigojapan> Macer: another example is the thunder cats
[15:18:13] <Macer> and the bad part is that the 20 shows they have for it are better than the movies they've made. haha
[15:18:30] <Macer> amigojapan: mumra never being able to just kill them?
[15:18:35] <Macer> even though he captured one of them 100 times
[15:18:46] <amigojapan> Right
[15:18:52] <Macer> thundercats had snarf to protect them tho

[17:04:44] <Berlin36> what languages
[17:05:14] <korewatori> not nearly as often as I used to tho. I don't really retain info for as long as I used to because I forgot a lot after some serious shit happened

[17:06:29] <korewatori> awesome field of work to go into
[17:06:32] <Berlin36> also malware is pretty cool
[17:06:38] <korewatori> TRUE
[17:06:49] <korewatori> I've been interested in malware analysis for as long as i can remember
[17:07:10] <korewatori> i've been playing around with IDA for a while but I've never actually properly reverse engineered anything 100%
[17:07:20] <Berlin36> woww
[17:07:27] <Berlin36> i tried GHIDRA
[17:07:30] <sharkwitch> nothing cool about that I think
[17:07:38] <Berlin36> it's like ida
[17:07:39] <korewatori> Ghidra is alright

[18:12:31] <ButterNoodle> yea in the early days you could make a usb stick tsr phone home package in a few clicks
[18:12:43] <Berlin36> ?
[18:12:44] <ButterNoodle> I was impressed
[18:12:48] <ButterNoodle> u know
[18:12:49] <Berlin36> what you mean
[18:12:55] <ButterNoodle> :|
[18:13:21] <ButterNoodle> make a package that exploits autorun on a usb stick
[18:13:35] <ButterNoodle> then phones home
[18:13:35] <Berlin36> oooh
[18:13:37] <ButterNoodle> then
[18:13:39] <Berlin36> xd
[18:13:40] <amigojapan> Berlin36: tsr is a memory resident program
[18:13:42] <ButterNoodle> command and control
[18:13:51] <Berlin36> why not use a microcontroller
[18:14:23] <Berlin36> oh wait
[18:14:35] <ButterNoodle> its a lot easier to get someone to plug in a usb stick for pwonage than getting them to plug in some hacked up piece of soldered shit you made in ur basement
[18:14:43] <Berlin36> yeah
[18:15:21] <ButterNoodle> and human curiosity dictates if someone finds a nice sandisk on the ground.. they gonna plug it in a look
[18:15:36] <Berlin36> hah yess
[18:15:52] <Berlin36> it's even funnier when there's a usb killer
[18:17:12] <ButterNoodle> I member that
[18:17:48] <ButterNoodle> I also member finding a SD card in a mall parking lot more than 10 years ago..
[18:18:03] <ButterNoodle> it was some latino girls photos
[18:18:17] <ButterNoodle> no info to find out and return
[18:19:08] <ButterNoodle> running joke is to print some of them as family photos and put on my desk if I ever work in the office again
[18:19:10] <amigojapan> Berlin36: USB killers are Hella expensive, you are not going to drop it on the ground
[18:20:20] <Berlin36> why not make your own
[18:20:24] <amigojapan> Butternoodle "this is my cousin Carlos
[18:20:44] <Berlin36> lmao ButterNoodle
[18:20:53] <amigojapan> Berlin36: well I don't want to break stuff
[18:21:03] <Berlin36> yeah that's a good reason
[18:21:21] <ButterNoodle> actually more like have mom, dad, and sister.. me obv not being latino
[18:21:27] <Berlin36> i wanna make a panic button that will shred the fuck out of everything important on my computer
[18:21:31] <ButterNoodle> there are some photoshop opportunities too
[18:21:34] <Berlin36> xd
[18:21:41] <ButterNoodle> Berlin36: lol just use crypto
[18:21:50] <ButterNoodle> delete the header
[18:21:53] <ButterNoodle> just as good
[18:21:57] <Berlin36> huh 
[18:21:59] <ButterNoodle> ?
[18:22:02] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: you never know. I don't look Latino but I have Latino cousins
[18:22:08] <ButterNoodle> u know.. encryption
[18:22:14] <Berlin36> i know yes
[18:22:20] <ButterNoodle> say for example luks
[18:22:37] <ButterNoodle> delete the luks header.. the rest of the drive is noise
[18:22:50] <Berlin36> •_•
[18:22:54] <ButterNoodle> dd and write random to the first 4M of the drive
[18:23:18] <ButterNoodle> thats all I do
[18:23:37] <Berlin36> cool cool
[18:23:50] <Berlin36> my disk is unencrypted ._.
[18:23:52] <ButterNoodle> and my panic script just secure deletes the keyfile and sysctl resets all my boxes
[18:24:06] <ButterNoodle> its 2021... everything should have encryption
[18:24:06] <Berlin36> what do u use for deleting
[18:24:11] <Berlin36> true
[18:24:15] <ButterNoodle> think about hard drive disposal
[18:24:45] <ButterNoodle> u dont have to physically destroy if its encrypted
[18:25:04] <ButterNoodle> ...I mean you should physically destroy always...
[18:25:12] <Berlin36> yes
[18:25:19] <Berlin36> i use a hard disk from 2011
[18:25:50] <Berlin36> i hope it won't die soon
[18:25:53] <ButterNoodle> but say its an rma on a failed disk.. u cant wipe all ur dick girl pics before u send it back to seagate if it doesnt have some kind of encryption
[18:26:18] <ButterNoodle> 10 years on unconditioned mains... ur on borrowed time
[18:26:36] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: so you don't even trust the encryption
[18:27:16] <Berlin36> lmao dickgirls
[18:27:26] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: you can always trust encryption today.. in 20 years aes-xts512 will probably be hacked and readable by ur smarywatch
[18:27:35] <ButterNoodle> *smartwatch
[18:27:43] <Berlin36> smart pp
[18:28:03] <amigojapan> I see ButterNoodle 
[18:28:10] <ButterNoodle> I mean we though the same thing about 3des 20 years ago
[18:28:20] <ButterNoodle> it was good enough at the time

[19:09:35] <marblesurf> i also know a ton of people my age or even older that don't know how to swim
[19:09:55] <Duns_Scrotus> and he let me spend like three hours trying bikes etc and fixing them when i tried them, and then i found one that i wanted but it needed a new wheel
[19:10:15] <amigojapan> marblesurf: I never got that. I learned how to swim by myself
[19:10:20] <Duns_Scrotus> so he ordered a new wheel and gave me another bike to use in the meantime (!), 
[19:10:39] <amigojapan> marblesurf: maybe now access to pools
[19:10:41] <Duns_Scrotus> and then i asked if he takes credit card and he didn't, so he told me that I can pay him later whenever I get a german bank account (!!)

[20:08:20] <Roey> so, we have this singer in Israel called Netta Barzilay.  She actually won the Eurovision song contest for Israel a few years back.  Every video she makes gets weirder and weirder.

[20:10:10] <Roey> I have an anime idea: make a story about a guy born with octopus tentacles instead of arms.  Like, three or four per side.  How would he grow up, and go through life?

[23:49:07] <ImoutoBot> [title] Ballade No. 1 in G Minor, Op. 23 - YouTube
[23:49:20] <Berlin36> yes i do listen to that too

[23:49:32] <Roey> it's just...oh my gosh, I have never found anything matching that
[23:49:35] <Roey> just so much emotion there
[23:49:48] <Berlin36> now i try to learn the text
[23:50:01] <Roey> :) :)
[23:50:04] <Berlin36> the text in the first 3 pages is not "that hard"
[23:50:04] <Roey> do it do it :)
[23:50:06] <Roey> you're 15, you said?

[23:52:58] <Roey> *to do this smoothly
