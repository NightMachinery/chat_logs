[00:00:17] * sm aims for a One Hundred Percent Working emacs to appreciate it in full
[00:05:07] <EvanR> so if you hit a ball with a moving ship/paddle by moving the mouse, that could mean serious momentum transfer
[00:05:20] <EvanR> you could easily screw yourself over
[00:06:15] <f-a> haha
[00:06:27] <f-a> an arkanoid clone where you have to be gentle, I would play that
[00:07:11] <EvanR> yeah I'm losing pretty fast just by having it move at speed = 5
[00:07:57] * sm still checking out Snek.. forgot the other big upgrade: multi-room terrain. Maybe this was done before, and I just haven't seen it, but I find this update of a little-touched classic intriguing. But... Windows only! Bah!
[00:08:27] <EvanR> my windows only steam games are somehow working
[00:08:31] <EvanR> on linux
[00:08:59] <sm> really! perhaps things are not what they seeem..
[00:09:21] <EvanR> a windows virus secretly took over my linux xD
[00:09:28] <EvanR> opposite of the 90s
[00:14:04] <EvanR> alright
[00:14:12] <EvanR> I'll buy temple of Snek and see if it works
[00:19:45] <EvanR> weird, it's complaining that the exe is not found
[00:23:43] <sm> I just tried the same on mac. It let me purchase, but downloaded very little and complains similarly. Bad steam.
[00:24:15] <ManofLetters[m]> I have a very attractive business proposal for you both
[00:24:44] <sm> oh wow, count me in Man of Letters ! 
[00:25:04] <sm> it seems I bought Defect Process back in october too
[00:26:45] <sm> oh I remember, I couldn't play it without a controller
[00:27:24] <sm> and getting a degree in fight game controlology
[00:28:08] <sm> but it sounds like I could now build my own version with simpler controls. That's pretty cool
[00:32:04] <sm> I suppose a controller is a good idea if you want to play games a bit
[00:32:49] <sm> hmm, I got one for the apple tv years ago and never got it going. I wonder if that would work
[00:34:56] <EvanR> I got the witcher for christmas
[00:36:12] <EvanR> doubt it's my speed, it may end up collecting dust
[00:37:38] <sm> ooh. I haven't played the game(s) but I'm a fan of the books and tv series
[00:42:20] <EvanR> interesting, I used a trick of relativity to speed up a ball when hit with a moving surface
[00:42:45] <EvanR> but if the surface is moving laterally, or something, it doesn't affect lateral speed
[00:42:52] <EvanR> like, I invented zero friction
[00:43:44] <EvanR> keeping it
[01:21:39] <EvanR> aw man what am I going to do ... if you want the paddle to track the mouse pointer exactly, this translates to huge velocity, which translates to huge hits
[01:22:06] <EvanR> to reel it in the paddle could track the mouse sluggishly and that sucks
[01:22:33] <EvanR> if it doesn't transfer enough momentum, the ball doesn't get out of the way fast enough for physics
[01:23:35] <EvanR> time to take a break
[01:27:34] <EvanR> needs more haptic feedback
[01:28:20] <sm> control of breakout is hard, it really works best with a paddle controller
[01:29:21] <sm> so-called, I guess because it controlled the "paddles" (bats) in Pong. A potentiometer.
[01:30:14] <EvanR> oh yeah

[22:47:00] <EvanR> fixed another "hole" caused by a typo in the geometry generator
[22:47:25] <EvanR> that I somehow noticed by hitting the ball for like 15 minutes
[22:47:39] <EvanR> floats. damn
[22:48:28] <EvanR> through a confluence of numerics it hit exactly at the point where two line segments join
[22:48:36] <EvanR> revealing my bug
[22:55:41] <sm> heheh. This will add fun cheats and tricks to be discovered by the dedicated players
[22:56:17] <EvanR> yes that's the problem with making it correct
[22:56:20] <EvanR> no exploits
[23:09:04] <EvanR> by setting the bat position = to the ball x I made the game play itself forever
[23:09:39] <EvanR> rarely the ball v becomes almost horizontal and takes forever 
[23:09:44] <EvanR> then hits a corner
[23:10:06] <EvanR> IRL breakout must guard against that
[23:15:13] <sm> yes real breakout doesn't allow arbitrary angles of bounce/motion
[23:29:36] <EvanR> so like, are the angles quantized somehow?
[23:43:12] <sm> I would think so, or there's a range of x/y velocities (I haven't read the Internet Breakout Spec yet)
[23:47:31] <EvanR> lol
[23:48:43] * sm gives in and goes in search of that
[23:49:42] <sm> no game mechanic spoilers here, but some nice history: https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7216
[23:54:04] <sm> look at these groovy gamers: https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=3847&image=1

[23:55:37] <sm> ooh.. this rabbit hole goes deep
[23:56:29] <sm> multiplayer breakout
[23:58:10] <EvanR> video games attracts all the chicks
