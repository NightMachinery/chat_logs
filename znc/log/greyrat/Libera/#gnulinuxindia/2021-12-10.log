[16:03:53] <NeoVoid[m]> can't we use ipfs or ipns protocol for communication?
[16:04:11] <Arya[m]> what is ipfs?
[16:04:55] <NeoVoid[m]> interplanetary file sharing protocol
[16:05:02] <NeoVoid[m]> its a new thing
[16:05:23] <NeoVoid[m]> awesome and solve lots of privacy and government tracking problem
[16:05:32] <Arya[m]> oh nice
[16:05:38] <Arya[m]> i was looking at their website
[16:05:51] <pystardust> guys, try port forwarding!
[16:06:01] <Arya[m]> port forwarding?
[16:06:02] <pystardust> then we can share files through the og protocol, torrents
[16:06:02] <NeoVoid[m]> also its good for hosting website without servers and and pirated data without servers
[16:06:13] <pystardust> its very easy to port forward if ur using airtel
[16:06:21] <pystardust> let me know if any one wants help
[16:06:35] <Arya[m]> you need ethernet ryt
[16:06:56] <NeoVoid[m]> whats port forwardingn
[16:07:00] <NeoVoid[m]> s/forwardingn/forwarding?/
[16:14:05] <relejek[m]> <Arya[m]> "what is ipfs?" <- ipfs already is and much better at what web3 wannabe. web3 is like a little brat who brags about being hero with a wooden sword in front of ipfs sword master.
[16:15:51] <relejek[m]> <pystardust> "then we can share files through..." <- it's good to learn port-forwarding but be extreamly careful coz it exposes your ip and your modems firewall won't protect you coz well you have to add exceptions it for a port-forwarding to work. it is good thing to learn though for private use.
[16:17:06] <relejek[m]> or if you have a r-pi laying around make a good use of it as a micro server. go for it pystardust  👍️
[16:17:36] <Arya[m]> I have spare computers to use but no PF 
[16:19:27] <relejek[m]> Arya[m]: PF is a configuration, that you do in your modem, where you have to assigne static ip to a system in your network and expose that ip to 'open' internet so that you can access it from anywhere over the WWW. 
[16:19:37] <Arya[m]> i have tried it
[16:19:41] <Arya[m]> but it has never worked
[16:19:53] <Arya[m]> i tried with ethernet, with wifi none worked
[16:19:56] <relejek[m]> just like you access a VPS server using its IP
[16:22:04] <relejek[m]> have you configured your system to have a static IP? 
[16:22:15] <Arya[m]> how
[16:22:26] <Arya[m]> i use ethernet with dhcp
[16:23:35] <relejek[m]> disable the dhcp and assigne an static IP to your system in your modem admin. also configure your net-man for same IP
[16:27:36] <Arya[m]> is static ip the same as adress reservation?
[16:28:37] <relejek[m]> i think so. the jargon is may  differ according to router  brand
[16:28:49] <relejek[m]> what is your router and pc system?
[16:29:25] <Arya[m]> tp link archer c6
[16:34:09] <relejek[m]> ok so it is a tp link. so for now just set a permanent address(static IP) for your system in the router.
[16:34:26] <Arya[m]> ok
[16:34:29] <relejek[m]> you may also need to feed it your system's MAC
[16:34:33] <Arya[m]> lemme connect it to ethernet
[16:34:34] <Arya[m]> one sec
[16:35:56] <pystardust> Arya[m]: you don't need ethernet
[16:36:26] <pystardust> relejek[m]: I port forward for torrenting not for server, I use vps for that
[16:36:33] <pystardust> web server*
[16:37:06] <pystardust> relejek[m]: you need to give it the local ip of the system, and set up dhcp static ip for the computer ur hosting
[16:38:24] <relejek[m]> pystardust:  i guess there are many uses. but why use PF for torrenting. it should work as is.
[16:40:08] <relejek[m]> you're on to something. it is just i am hearing this for first time or i am not getting it.
[16:40:42] <relejek[m]> who are you giving your local IP to?
[16:41:03] <pystardust> relejek[m]: torrenting is a peer to peer protocol. If you have 2 computers and want to open a socket, then you need one of their ports to be open. What this means is when ever u torrent you are only sharing files with people whose port is open. You are not talking to people whose ports are closed. Search up why opening ports for torrenting is a good
[16:44:05] <pystardust> if ur port is closed you can't share a file with some other person whoes port is closed. (unless one of u  have ur port open)
[16:45:24] <Arya[m]> i setup adress reservation, wut should i do next
[16:45:41] <relejek[m]> hmm hmm. technically i get you. my question is, shouldn't a torrent client do that out of the box.
[16:45:51] <relejek[m]> pystardust:  ^
[16:46:08] <Arya[m]> I put it in the wrong one 
[16:46:08] <Arya[m]> rip
[16:47:01] <relejek[m]> Arya[m]: take it slow buddy.
[16:47:11] <Arya[m]> this is weird
[16:47:13] <pystardust> relejek[m]: a torrent client doesn't open ports for you, it only allows you to connect to people, and if ur port is closed, then you only connect to people with their ports open (as one of the user in the socket conenction should have their ports open).

[16:47:38] <Arya[m]> wut should i put in this field
[16:48:24] <pystardust> Arya[m]: I don't think this is the right place to change, check for port mapping/forwarding
[16:49:02] <Arya[m]> NAT forwarding -> Virtual Servers is what i have seen 
[16:49:07] <Arya[m]> to be port forwarding
[16:52:04] * Arya[m] uploaded an image: (21KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/clrcScNzEpsSFTgfOCekUmNJ/2021-12-10T18%3A51%3A45%2C808489646%2B05%3A30.png >
[16:52:05] <Arya[m]> this is what i have
[16:53:33] <pystardust> Arya[m]: nice, now try hosting something on that port and check if its working
[16:53:41] <Arya[m]> ok
[16:53:43] <Arya[m]> lemme see
[16:54:08] <relejek[m]> Arya[m]: so far so good buddy.
[16:54:41] <relejek[m]> pystardust:  upon further research i get the importance of what you want to convey. 
[16:55:09] <relejek[m]> thank you for sharing this. PF does have a +ve for torrenting.
[16:55:18] <pystardust> nice, I also believe that we should abandon servers and embrace more peer to peer solutions which are only possible with ports open
[16:58:17] <pystardust> Arya[m]: run this with sudo prevs with python3 https://harshith.xyz/pastebin/test.py
[16:58:58] <gtlsgamr> Arya is under double NAT like me. He probably won't be able to host shit even if he wanted to
[16:59:00] <pystardust> then user this site https://portchecker.co/ and put port number to 28802, check if the port is open
[16:59:49] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: how do you know he is under double nat?
[17:00:32] <gtlsgamr> We discussed it some months ago, so unless he changed ISPs, his double NAT is still there
[17:00:43] <pystardust> oh, how did you check?
[17:01:21] <gtlsgamr> I don't remember that
[17:01:46] <pystardust> by comparing his ip in his router page with his actual ip?
[17:01:50] <gtlsgamr> Yes
[17:01:52] <gtlsgamr> Yes!
[17:02:13] <pystardust> Ah, that sucks then, anyways Arya[m] try it out and see
[17:02:41] <pystardust> relejek[m]: you conviced to open port?
[17:03:17] <pystardust> not only that, you can host ur own game servers, stuff like jisti, nextclound and all other cool stuff for free if you do so
[17:04:50] <Arya[m]> its still closed ☹️
[17:04:59] <Arya[m]> i opened udp port 
[17:05:05] <relejek[m]> <pystardust> "nice, I also believe that we..." <- hold your horses bhai. PF could create a vulnerability to your system.
[17:05:37] <pystardust> relejek[m]: yes it can, but if you port forward the right ports and know what ur doing then it wont
[17:06:51] <pystardust> also you can use a firewall if your afraid
[17:08:31] <relejek[m]> yeah with that much technical know how, a person of our caliber should, as i said before, start a mini server with r-pi. as for torrenting and p2p net as well
[17:09:50] <relejek[m]> call me afraid or cautious. don't let me keep you from learning though. it is indeed a super useful stuff to know
[17:14:14] <Arya[m]> its only working on LAN
[17:15:34] <Arya[m]> any other thing i can do
[17:17:14] <relejek[m]> Arya[m]: you're pretty much there.
[17:17:24] <Arya[m]> what should i do next
[17:17:32] <Arya[m]> i port forwarded 1347 TCP
[17:17:41] <Arya[m]> then changed test.py pystar gave to use 1347
[17:17:55] <Arya[m]> the computer i am testing that on is using dhcp
[17:17:58] <Arya[m]> is that an issue
[17:18:23] <Arya[m]> but with dhcp address reservation
[17:20:03] <relejek[m]> hmm only service host need static IP. that you've done.
[17:20:12] <relejek[m]> is it true that you've an issue of double NAT?
[17:20:19] <Arya[m]> what is double nat
[17:20:27] <relejek[m]> can we test it, if it is true?
[17:20:39] <Arya[m]> how
[17:21:14] <relejek[m]> 2x NAT is like your router is also connected to other router or ISP gatewat that act as an DHCP server.
[17:21:46] <relejek[m]> yeah i am bumped here aswell. sorry. never dealt with a 2x NAT
[17:22:22] <relejek[m]> i think that only applies in a institutional setting like a academic setup or a hostel
[17:22:44] <relejek[m]> or a huge office complex.
[17:23:21] <Arya[m]> nah i am using normal isp
[17:23:23] <telegram_1960104> Hi can anyone help me with shell scripting?
[17:24:02] <relejek[m]> Arya:  https://www.purevpn.com/blog/double-nat/#How_to_Check_a_Double_NAT
[17:24:18] <relejek[m]> at least test it. it's no harm to figure this out.
[17:25:34] <Arya[m]> i tried
[17:25:47] <Arya[m]> i got 192.168.0.1 for the first
[17:25:59] <Arya[m]> and second i got 10.207.0.1
[17:26:19] <relejek[m]> Arya[m]: yup that seems like sign of 2x NAT
[17:26:27] <relejek[m]> may be your ISP does this.
[17:26:28] <Arya[m]> rip
[17:27:10] <relejek[m]> F
[17:28:04] <relejek[m]> gtlsgamr: you were right all along fam. sad, but you warned Arya.
[17:28:55] <Arya[m]> is there a udp port tunnel
[17:31:32] <PriyanshuRai[m]> <iamak[m]> "How do I make my dwm bar display..." <- DE?
[17:35:23] <iamak[m]> Dwm
[17:37:40] <iamak[m]> I tried something and I can change it to `WM_CLASS` but `xprop` shows 2 values. It shows the first value and I want it to show the second.
[17:37:40] <iamak[m]> Eg: for Firefox
[17:37:40] <iamak[m]> `WM_CLASS="Navigator", "Firefox" `. It shows Navigator instead of Firefox
[17:40:50] <pystardust> Arya[m]: you need to open tcp for the web server script I sent
[17:41:36] <telegram_8037364> <Arya[m]> "what is double nat" <- multiple people from your neighborhood would have the same ip as you?
[17:41:51] <Arya[m]> pystardust: did it
[17:41:54] <Arya[m]> still didnt work
[17:42:04] <telegram_8037364> compare curl ip.me and your router ip
[17:42:46] <telegram_8037364> <Arya[m]> "rip" <- you could still open ports but you would have to contact the isp for each one
[17:43:17] <telegram_8037364> ofc they would push you to buy a static ip first :p
[17:44:11] <klimi[m]> What are you guys doing with IPs? I'm interested and curiojs
[17:44:14] <Arya[m]> yup its different
[17:44:14] <klimi[m]> s/curiojs/curious/
[17:44:48] <klimi[m]> Setting up some server?
[17:44:49] <relejek[m]> telegram_8037364: wut es dis capitalist bullcrap !?!?! 😤
[17:45:33] <klimi[m]> relejek[m]: Double nating?
[17:45:41] <klimi[m]> Or NATs in general?
[17:45:43] <klimi[m]> They are very useful
[17:45:48] <telegram_8037364> Arya[m]: contact the isp
[17:46:00] <relejek[m]> no selling Static IPs
[17:46:16] <klimi[m]> Well static IPs are very few
[17:46:26] <klimi[m]> It wouldn't give sense to give them away for free
[17:46:34] <klimi[m]> That would utterly stupid
[17:46:53] <relejek[m]> klimi:  i get you.
[17:47:12] <klimi[m]> Who is trying to do what? Maybe I can help
[17:50:17] <relejek[m]> Arya and pystar want do Port forwarding to host and share services from there own pc. a p2p web of sorts.
[17:50:43] <klimi[m]> That would be nearly impossible
[17:50:47] <klimi[m]> Get a VPS
[17:51:21] <relejek[m]> from Pystar
[17:51:21] <relejek[m]> > nice, I also believe that we should abandon servers and embrace more peer to peer solutions which are only possible with ports open

[17:51:32] <telegram_8037364> my neighbor got bullied by local isp cause he choose bsnl over an other
[17:52:24] <relejek[m]> telegram_8037364: ooo poor guy. same airtel bimbos also harassed my neighbors.

[17:52:26] <klimi[m]> Well it is not "for free" but otherwise you can do that from vps also
[17:53:07] <relejek[m]> BSNL guys are poor lads their service is not the best but they were kind when i used their service. YMMY
[17:53:45] <telegram_8037364> relejek[m]: bsnl pretty good hear, fiber+ no double nat + cheap
[17:53:57] <klimi[m]> What's bad with double Nat?
[17:54:16] <relejek[m]> oh yeah, their new fiber offers. i heard some good stuff.
[17:54:23] <telegram_8037364> klimi[m]: no self host
[17:55:03] <relejek[m]> no port forwarding to be exposed to WWW
[17:55:04] <Sayon[m]> what can i do with a free domain?
[17:55:45] <relejek[m]> Sayon:  try get a "free" hosting /s
[17:55:46] <klimi[m]> telegram_8037364: Hosting things out of your home network is generally a bad idea...
[17:55:59] <klimi[m]> relejek[m]: I have free hosting and?
[17:56:10] <Sayon[m]> what how
[17:56:15] <klimi[m]> relejek[m]: That's a good thing for 99.9% of people
[17:56:27] <klimi[m]> Sayon[m]: Oracle free cloud
[17:56:35] <Sayon[m]> wtff
[17:56:38] <klimi[m]> Or if you are student you get 300$ for azure
[17:56:41] <Sayon[m]> does it require any cc
[17:56:44] <klimi[m]> Or google has their own free tier
[17:56:47] <klimi[m]> Sayon[m]: Well yeah ofc

[17:57:37] <Sayon[m]> azure and oracle?
[17:57:39] <relejek[m]> Sayon:  how is it free?
[17:57:39] <Sayon[m]> right

[21:13:14] <gtlsgamr> I don't think GitHub can do that
[21:13:24] <gtlsgamr> That's why I need someone to manually generate it for now

[21:24:20] <gtlsgamr> You made one small mistake
[21:24:38] <gtlsgamr> Can you rebuild and repull? You need to install the markdown package in your system
[21:24:42] <gtlsgamr> So that it can convert
[21:24:47] <gtlsgamr> Otherwise no pages will generate
[21:25:16] <gtlsgamr> The package is called markdown, install it
[21:25:26] <gtlsgamr> Then rebuild the site and re-upload the PR
