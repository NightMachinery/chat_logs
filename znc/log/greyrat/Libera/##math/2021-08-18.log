[01:27:54] <riv> hello
[01:27:59] <Juliu> Hi
[01:28:29] <riv> how can i evaluate this integral? int[0,inf] (1/(e^t - 1) - e^(-t)/t) dt ?
[01:28:46] <Juliu> riv, try wolfram alpha. That's the easierst way :)
[01:29:11] <StayHungry> Juliu: could you take a peek at https://s3.rokket.space/t_1Bv5N6.png
[01:29:13] <buster> StayHungry: only one answer fits
[01:29:32] <Juliu> fds, is there any mathematical reason or hint or clue why you think that SAT is probably not solvable in P ?
[01:31:43] <Juliu> StayHungry, number_of_salads * cost_per_salad + number_of_drinks * cost_per_drink = total_evenue. You know all but 1 of these variables. So plug in the numbers and calculate the missing value
[01:32:04] <StayHungry> buster, Juliu: my train of thought is as follows. 77*6.5=500.5, then 836.5-500.5=336, then 336/2=168, so 77 fits because (77*6.5)+(168*2)=836.5. the same way fits 93 and 105.
[01:32:12] <buster> StayHungry, the first step is to write the given facts algebraically
[01:32:37] <buster> Juliu, there are two unknowns there
[01:32:52] <Juliu> StayHungry, in your example this is 209 * $6.50 + n * $2.00 = $836.50, where n is the unknown number of drinks that you want to know
[01:33:01] *** Quits: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:33:14] <Juliu> buster, there is only 1 unknown
[01:33:46] <buster> StayHungry, 77 salads + 168 drinks =245 salads and drinks, not 209
[01:33:48] <fds> Juliu: Nothing particular comes to mind.  As I said, computational complexity is not my primary interest.
[01:34:07] <Juliu> buster, the exercise says that 209 salads were sold
[01:34:27] <Juliu> fds, ok. Then what is your primary interest?
[01:35:00] <StayHungry> buster: ah, i see now
[01:35:12] <StayHungry> buster: B is the right option then, because 93+116=209
[01:35:23] <StayHungry> hooray :D
[01:35:29] <buster> StayHungry, that's right.
[01:35:44] <fds> Juliu: I said above.  Characterisations of unsatisfiable clause-sets and using such characterisations to solve combinatorial problems.
[01:36:29] <Juliu> StayHungry, since 209 * $6.50 is more than $836.50, so the exercise is unclear and they probably meant that 209 salads and drinks combined were solved
[01:36:33] <buster> StayHungry, you have two unknowns x (number of salads), y (number of drinks) and two equations 6.5x+2y=836.5, x+y=209.
[01:36:47] <buster> It's pretty clear.
[01:37:40] <Juliu> StayHungry, in that case you would have n * $6.50 + (209 - n) * $2.00 = $836.50, where n is the number of salads
[01:38:34] <Juliu> StayHungry, so the answer is that 93 salads were sold
[01:39:08] <Juliu> buster, y = 209 - x
[01:40:29] <StayHungry> thank you, comrades :)

[02:05:42] <Juliu> *correct
[02:05:56] <fds> Juliu: My point is that if your encoded problem always contained {x, ¬x} as a subset (or indeed {{}}) then you could translate that back into the non-existence of any solutions to your problem, for example.
[02:06:47] <fds> So you're using SAT encodings as a tool to solve (or perhaps obtain information) about combinatorial problems.
[02:07:07] <fds> Or prove the non-existence of solutions, as the case may be...
[02:07:40] <Juliu> fds, yes, like I said earlier, if a clause set contains any unsat sub-problem, then the whole thing is unsat. But identifying this sub-problem is hard

[02:11:53] <Juliu> fds, just as an advice: Transforming a problem into a different domain will NOT add information. The information always stays the same in the best case, or decreases, in which case you even lose information. And if the new domain is not better suited to solve/prove something, there is zero advantage of doing this

[02:12:59] <Juliu> fds, so the main question here is: Is the SAT domain really better suited to solve/prove something about combinatorial problems? I doubt that somehow
[02:14:12] <fds> There are lots of combinatorial problems.  I have a hunch I can make something work (I'll let you know if I get it working).  There are lots of theorems in this area that are not well-known to combinatorialists.

[02:37:36] <StayHungry> buster: i solved that by selection principle, wonder if there is another way. that is, i played a bit with equation: x = (176-y)/55, then i picked a multiplier as close as possible to 176 (which happens to be 3, 55*3=165), then 176-165=11. and finally, x+y=3+11=14 :)

[04:04:22] <somiaj> The root you get often depends on the branch of the logarithim you use, though the prinicipal root is often the one with the smallets positive argument
[04:04:31] <Fangs> principal Log just turns z = r e^it, with t in (0,2pi) to Log(z) = log(r) + it
[04:04:35] <Fangs> err
[04:04:44] <Fangs> principal Log just turns z = r e^it, with t in (-pi,+pi) to Log(z) = log(r) + it
[04:05:31] <Fangs> so sqrt1(z) = e^{1/2 Log1(z)), this is basically a really fancy way of saying sqrt(z) = r^{1/2} e^{it/2}

[04:22:28] <somiaj> if you are parametrizing a curve y = x^2 in the complex plane, you need a map from C

[04:23:01] <Fangs> you can either just do f(z) = (z,z^2) and be done with it

[07:44:38] <droid3> hey guys got a quick question
[07:45:24] <droid3> How do you know when to stop testing lucas numbers for a mersenne number ?
[07:46:11] <droid3> I mean sure if you got a very very very probable prime then if it is prime the there exist some lucas number that will divide it

[07:46:49] <droid3> But what happens if its a composite mersenne prime that you cannt find the a factor to.
[07:47:05] <int-e> For Mersenne primes there's this, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas-Lehmer_primality_test
[07:47:11] <droid3> Then when should you stop testing lucas numbers and give up?
[07:48:31] <droid3> Like how do you know if the number is prime how far you got to go up in lucas numbers to pass the lucas lehmer test???
[07:48:39] <int-e> So you don't do any trial division at all; I think you don't even bother with Rabin-Miller because that's about as expensive as the full Lucas-Lehmer test.

[07:50:16] *** Joins: aakashi2009 (~aakashi20@103.61.255.28)
[07:50:30] <droid3> what i am asking is the lucas-lehmer test tells us that a mersenne number is divisible by some lucas number if and only if its prime
[07:50:58] <droid3> But it doesnt tell you how far you got to go up in lucas numbers before you can stop searching ???

[07:52:57] <droid3> right mod arithmetic of lucas numbers is the only way you can have the size to search for greater ones. If you tried generating them without modular arithmetic and just dividing you get out of memory /overflows ...etc
[07:52:58] <int-e> Sorry, what do you want to do with the Mersenne number? Do you want to test primality?

[07:54:10] <int-e> The Lucas-Lehmer test tells you whether a Mersenne number is prime. Period. No trial division.
[07:55:02] <int-e> If you want to factor Meresenne numbers that are not primes, that'll be a different story.

[07:57:18] <droid3> O wait i was getting at what size Sn you had to use and  i now see its S_p-2  so if your testing 2^p -1 then you need to compute lucas sequence up to S_p-2  mod ( the mersenne number )
[07:58:13] <droid3> But eventually even S_p-2 is going to be hard to compute/ have enough space to store even with modular arithmetic some day
[07:59:11] <droid3> curious how does GIMP and other distributed computing setup usually make these lucas sequences distributively calculated ????

[08:01:30] <droid3> Just guessing on this one because doing it my guessing way is going to cause a lot of multicasting traffic
[08:02:04] <int-e> It doesn't distribute on that level; it hands out primes to test.

These tests require the most work and have the best chance of finding a new Mersenne prime. Computers between 1GHz and 1.4 GHz usually get double-check assignments. These assignments do not take as long and can find a Mersenne prime only if the original test had a problem. The slowest computers are usually assigned factoring

[11:22:47] <riv> fweht, I've never heard of a category internal to GRP before, what does that mean? I've heard of group objects in an arbitrary category

[11:24:38] <Fangs> riv: its groups G_0 and G_1 together with two maps s,t: G_1 -> G_0 called source and targets and from there you define a category 'diagramatically'
[11:24:40] <fweht> riv: it means you have an objects OBJ of 'objects', an object ARR of 'arrows', an arrow DOM:ARR->OBJ sending each 'arrow' to its domain, an arrow COD:ARR->OBJ sending each arrow to its codomain and an arrow ID:OBJ->ARR sending each object to its identity arrow, on basis of these one can define all category axioms
[11:24:45] <Fangs> (source and target needs to be composable)
[11:25:09] <Fangs> (arrows with compatible source and target needs to be composable)
[11:25:12] <fweht> i find it super weird to think about this
[11:25:25] <riv> ooh i see
[11:25:31] <Fangs> fweht: why are you looking at this?
[11:25:41] <fweht> so in a category internal to group if we have f:x->y we also have (f*f):(x*x)->(y*y) if i understand it right
[11:25:53] <fweht> i dunno just stumbled across
[11:26:05] <fweht> and wondered where this weird symmetry comes from
[11:26:15] <riv> that's interesting that a category can have categories internal to it

[11:28:24] <riv> I assume Set is another example of this?
[11:28:38] <Fangs> naively those are 'small' categories
[11:28:52] <fweht> can you diagrammatically define a set :O
[11:29:05] <Fangs> no, they meant a category interal to Set
[11:29:15] <fweht> aah i see
[11:29:48] <riv> oh right, we don't have a 'set internal to a category' although perhaps just any old object would do for that
[11:29:58] <fweht> yeah a category internal to SET is a category, but what i wondered was if a set internal to CAT is also the same thing, which is the case if you define internal sets as mere objects
[11:30:18] <fweht> cool :)
[11:32:16] <Fangs> fweht: here's something that's potentially fun: can you show that if you have a category integral to Grp, then you can create a monoidal product on it?
[11:33:00] <Fangs> (in the sense of a monoidal category is a category with a functor C x C -> C...)

[11:37:04] <Fangs> so f, g are in G_1 (group of arrows), so we "can" define f*g as the usual group product there
[11:37:23] <Fangs> but why would source(f*g) be the same thing as source(f)*source(g)?

[13:13:46] <riv> are you sure about that
[13:13:52] <cherim> From -1 in front of -e^(-t)/t dt, from -vdu in "by parts", and from de^{-t}
[13:14:29] <riv> thanks a lot ! i think this is definitely the approach I like

[13:19:39] <riv> and i can just replace e^(-a) with 0
[13:19:52] <riv> but i don't really feel comfortable about cancelling infs with log(a)
[13:20:01] <riv> since they come from different limits
[13:20:05] <riv> is that concern valid?

[13:20:57] <cherim> The integral is real, everything is converging well, why get ambiguous complex logarithms

[13:21:41] <riv> for int[a,inf] dt/(e^t - 1) i have the antiderivative log(1 - e^t) + t
[13:21:41] <cherim> [11:25:32] <cherim> The first integral should be something like log(1-exp(-a)) ~ -log(a) + O(a)
[13:22:21] <cherim> Put e^t inside one log, don't do log(1) = log(-1)*log(-1)

[16:08:50] <int-e> oh wait
[16:09:12] <PlanckWalk> Oh yes, plenty of other
[16:09:26] <int-e> there's no way to get out of {5*n | n in N}, now it's correct.

[16:11:48] <PlanckWalk> It's fairly clear that they all end at something in 1 ... 5
[16:12:13] <rxvt> how do you even prove this
[16:12:14] <PlanckWalk> (and you pretty quickly see that 2,3,4 end at 1)
[16:12:14] <kobalt> f(multiple_of_5) always loops with f(5)
[16:12:43] <int-e> rxvt: if n is odd and n > 5... then f(n) is related to some f(m) with m < n. So you can focus on f(1)..f(5).
[16:13:24] <PlanckWalk> Yep, proof by well ordering principle is straightforward
[16:13:26] <rxvt> is there a formal definition of being "related"

[16:17:21] <rxvt> i am still in high school so nobody knows how to store results in variables with the proper 14 decimal precision scientific calcs have
[16:18:10] <rxvt> so unless you round every step in your calculation to the nearest 10^-3, and use the full precision floats, you'll have negligible error

[16:23:22] <greenbagels> rxvt: they're likely just doing that to keep it grounded/intuitive for the class; in practice, numerical algorithms can have hundreds (or thousands) of steps, each adding in rounding error; and you could still end up with very very small rounding errors overall!

[16:24:11] <PlanckWalk> kobalt: It's straightforward to prove that f(5) = f(5k) for all k, and f(everything else) = f(1).
[16:24:44] <greenbagels> in a physical science lab class you will usually keep track of numbers to 1-2 extra decimal places (to accomodate rounding errors), and truncate it to a more reasonable precision at the end
[16:24:53] <int-e> rxvt: start with an n > 5, and apply the equations from left to right one or two times.
[16:24:55] <PlanckWalk> So in particular, f(n) = f(n+5) = f(5) if n is a multiple of 5, and f(n) = f(n+5) = f(1) otherwise.

[19:14:33] <anovick_> it felt a bit hand wavy to me as well though...
[19:14:40] <cherim> It goes "Since A then B" for pairs of statements A, B that are about as far apart as the original problem
[19:15:01] <cherim> And then wanders without much sense of direction
[19:15:04] <Z-module> cherim, you can avoid non-constructive stuff for (2). Let z > 1 be a fixed real with z^n irrational for all natural n (z = pi is good). Then f = the characteristic function of the set  {z, z^2, z^3, ...}  works, because if even two distinct values from   x, 2x, 3x, ...  (nevermind infinitely many) are powers of z, say  mx = z^j, nx = z^k  with naturals n > m  and  k > j  (and any particular positive x), then  z^(k - j) = n/m.
[19:15:06] <anovick_> ??
[19:15:18] <anovick_> if anything it doesn't wander anywhere
[19:15:33] <anovick_> it is quite concise
[19:15:36] <cherim> But if you accept these "Since A then B" as correct, the whole thing is correct as well

[22:51:15] <Franciman> example f(x) = 1/x
[22:51:18] <Franciman> ok
[22:51:25] <Franciman> thanks Z-module super helpful as always
[22:51:33] *** Quits: kobalt (~rsonx@user/kobalt) (Read error: No route to host)
[22:51:41] <joel135> seems right to me, except it is missing a minus sign
[22:52:50] <joel135> recall e^-a = 1/e^a and log(1/w) = -log(w) ...
[22:54:21] <tolarz> log(e^a / (e^a - 1)) = log(1 / (1 - e^(-a)) = log(1) - log(1 - e^(-a)) = -log(1 - e^(-a)) = log(1/(1 - exp(-a))
[22:54:23] <tolarz> and now?
[22:54:36] <tolarz> oh
[22:54:45] <tolarz> this was what we expected modulo a minus sign
[22:54:54] <Z-module> Franciman: no, take U = (0, +infty), f: U -> R  being f(x) = 1/x.   This f has no continuous extension to closure(U) = [0, infty)
[22:54:54] <tolarz> the key idea is reducing the fraction by e^a
[22:55:34] <Z-module> but if f is *uniformly* continuous on U, then you always can (in the general metric space setting).
[22:55:55] <joel135> right
[22:56:08] <Z-module> (no bijectivity even needed)
[22:56:27] <Franciman> Z-module: makes sense yea
[22:56:56] <Franciman> I was asking because I wanted to think about the case f : X \subseteq R^n \to R^n
[22:57:03] <Franciman> when X is neither closed nor open
[22:57:06] <[-_-]> Is there a rule that flux can only be calculated for a gaussian surface?

[23:07:39] <Z-module> Franciman: well, in general if X, Y are metric spaces, and D \subset X is dense in X (no other restriction on D, in terms of closed/open/anything), then any uniformly continuous map  f: D -> Y   has a unique extension to a continuous map X -> Y,  which will also be uniformly continuous automatically.

[23:13:36] <Simplar> Suppose you're rolling a die, and get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 coins depending on what rolled on a die. The game ends if you roll 1 or 2, but you get paid for that roll too. What's the expected value of coins you get in that game?

[23:17:55] <xormor> 12³ + 1³ = 10³ + 9³ = 1729 = Hardy-Ramanujan taxi number
[23:21:58] <qed> Simplar, compute the expected number of turns in the game using geometric distribution
[23:22:38] *** Joins: crankslider (~slidercra@user/slidercrank)
[23:23:03] *** crankslider is now known as slidercrank
[23:23:09] <qed> now in each turn except the last the expected gain is (3+4+5+6)/4
[23:23:22] <qed> expected gain of last round (1+2)/2
[23:24:04] <Simplar> you have 1/6 probability to roll any value of a die. so you have 2/6 = 1/3 probability to roll 1 or 2.
[23:24:25] <Simplar> so 1/3 is the probability to end the game
[23:24:28] <qed> Simplar, so geometric dist. with p=1/3
[23:24:31] <Simplar> yes
[23:24:34] <Simplar> got it
[23:26:26] <Simplar> hmm...
[23:27:33] <Simplar> if the probability to end the game on the first round is 1/3
[23:27:46] *** Quits: zacts (~zacts@user/zacts) (Quit: zacts)
[23:28:00] <Simplar> then the probability to end the game on the second round is (1-1/3)*1/3
[23:28:21] <Simplar> since the amount of rounds never changes the probability itself
[23:29:44] <Simplar> on the third round, it's (1-1/3)^2 * 1/3
[23:29:45] <Simplar> etc
[23:29:51] <Simplar> am i right so far?
[23:30:36] <Simplar> M(X) = 1/p, where p is the probability to end the game afaik for geometric dist
[23:31:18] <Simplar> So M(X) = 1/(1/3) = 3
[23:31:52] <Simplar> so this is the expected amount of turns
[23:33:29] <Simplar> So, 3*(3+4+5+6)/4+(1+2)/2 is the expected gain then? @qed
[23:34:14] <Simplar> means the answer is 15
[23:34:27] <Simplar> oh wait
[23:34:29] <Simplar> 3 turns
[23:34:36] <Simplar> and the last one is 1 or 2
[23:34:56] <Simplar> so means the expected gain for two first turns is (3+4+5+6)/4
[23:35:04] <Simplar> and for the last turn is (1+2)/2
[23:35:24] <Simplar> so it's 2*(3+4+5+6)/4+(1+2)/2 = 10.5

[23:51:36] <riv> oh ill get on that
[23:51:55] <riv> is that actually used in studying twin primes?
[23:52:27] <Z-module> no, it's a smart-aleck response on my part
[23:53:24] <Z-module> but we do know (and have for over a century) that  SUM_{twin-primes p} 1/p    is finite, regardless of whether infinitely many such primes exist.
