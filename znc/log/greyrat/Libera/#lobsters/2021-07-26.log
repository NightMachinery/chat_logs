[18:11:17] <kline> of course, you need to mind the gotcha of "cant use lobsters because not logged in, cant log in because cant use lobsters"
[18:12:20] <kline> maybe put logged out tor users on an early redirect to the login page

[18:14:32] <epilys> kline, it's meant to accomodate existing users, but yes
[18:14:43] <kline> Teckla, i would be disappointed if the decision was that because of a very small number of users, a good tool became inaccessible to all

[18:15:37] <ngoldbaum> sadly it’s the nature of tor that it’s a great tool for resisting censorship while simultaneously being a great tool for anonymous griefing
[18:15:51] <kline> so login/register endpoints must be hittable via unauthed tor
[18:15:59] <epilys> kline, yeah I agree but I only suggested it as an alternative to banning tor completely
[18:16:12] <epilys> true, login/register doesn't have to be gated
[18:16:16] <kline> (for irc this is _quite_ difficult. there is a solution i have in mind but theres other infrastructural roadblocks first)
[18:16:23] <Teckla> kline: I'm definitely not arguing against Tor (and http) being useful tools, but are they actually useful in the context of Lobsters?
[18:16:24] <c355e3b> login needs to be gated
[18:16:37] <c355e3b> credentials stuffing
[18:16:40] <kline> c355e3b, maybe rate limited
[18:17:05] <epilys> rate limit all tor exit nodes?
[18:17:17] <kline> just rate limit any IP
[18:17:27] <kline> theres no reason to not rate-limit logins on the clearnet as well
[18:17:29] <epilys> but tor gives you a new circuit with every request
[18:17:35] <kline> does it?
[18:17:40] <wink> rate limit bsd o'clock? oh noes
[18:18:03] <jj5> rwb: I found the main JavaScript client code over here https://www.progclub.org/pcrepo/pclog/branches/0.3/src/9-app/client/browser.js
[18:18:09] <mockturtle> [ [ViewVC] Contents of: pcrepo/pclog/branches/0.3/src/9-app/client/browser.js ] - www.progclub.org
[18:18:45] <epilys> kline, ok maybe not (not sure) but you can change the circuit any time
[18:18:51] <kline> epilys, " For efficiency, the Tor software uses the same circuit for connections that happen within the same ten minutes or so. Later requests are given a new circuit, to keep people from linking your earlier actions to the new ones. "
[18:18:52] <pushcx> If the login/register is ungated, the credential testing we see from Tor would just shift to that page.
[18:19:04] <kline> yes, you can change the circuit at any time, but thats expensive
[18:19:06] <Teckla> Lobsters seems mostly to serve technical people that like to discuss obscure(-ish) technology, with some mainstream stuff peppered in.  It doesn't really seem like an important "free speech zone".
[18:19:28] <Teckla> IRC, on the other hand, seems like an ideal candidate to allow anonymous communication.
[18:19:31] <jj5> rwb: you can see window.onerror hooked here https://www.progclub.org/pcrepo/pclog/branches/0.3/src/9-app/client/browser.js#l115
[18:19:33] <kline> if you were to re-establish a new circuit for every attempt to stuff creds, thats probably rate limiting enough to seriously hamper the value
[18:19:35] <rwb> thanks

[18:21:59] <pushcx> If it's a fun exercise, great, don't let me stop you, I just don't want to folks to worry that we're on fire. We are on fire often enough that we don't need to accidentally invent fires. :)
[18:22:30] <pushcx> wink: Good way to put it. Must submit one manager signoff on a PR at work per week to browse.
[18:22:30] <rwb> a meta-fire: a fire which is itself on fire
[18:23:33] <kline> wink, the idea is that every potentially attacking action has a cost. on the web, this is usually a clean IP, since its easy to ban an IP and force a user to find another. for registering accounts its usually a clean email address, etc. something that can easily be applied to most places is a proof of work where the attacker must dedicate enough resources on each attempt to make it hard to scale
[18:23:33] <kline> their attack
[18:24:26] <wink> kline: yeah, I got the idea. IFF you posit browsing lobste.rs at work as wasting time it's still a fun quip tho :P
