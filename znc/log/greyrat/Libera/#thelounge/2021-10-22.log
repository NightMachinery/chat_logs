[00:19:11] <johncs> MaxLeiter: I am. I didn't populate my DB with 100,000 fake messages to test it for real, but the unit tests I added makes me think the bug is probably fixed
[00:19:28] <johncs> bookworm can hopefully confirm whether it's ordering right for him now, since he has enough history
[00:21:01] <xnaas> Just join a linux channel and say positive things about systemd
[00:21:06] <xnaas> you'll have a full chatlog in no time

[00:21:35] * xnaas might be a pot-stirrer
[00:23:17] <bookworm> I didn't yet apply the new changes, was out with some friends. Can do so tomorrow
[00:23:55] <bookworm> Activ8: what exec plugin? Why do you think I run such a plugin?
[00:26:21] <johncs> Ha actually I could just lower my limit *facepalm*. Well might as well just wait anyways.
[00:28:36] <Activ8> bookworm never mind I got it working

[18:55:46] <bookworm> or what do you run oidentd as?
[18:56:00] <bookworm> generally system daemons don't have a home dir
[18:59:54] <bookworm> (you do realize that oidentd is an external daemon, yes?)
[19:00:13] <bookworm> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oidentd
[19:00:30] <bookworm> it's also not compatible with windows... sooooo probably not your thing
[19:01:04] <Activ8> it's on my linux box, if it's an external thing then I assume libera only supports ident then
[19:01:23] <Activ8> I didn't know that no
[19:01:24] <bookworm> libera doesn't care what daemon you run, as long as it speaks the proper protocol
