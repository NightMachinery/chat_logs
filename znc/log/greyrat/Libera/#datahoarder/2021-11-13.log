[19:31:15] <moo> so i have unifi unvr and why the hell is sfp+ port on the back of the device lol . my puny 20? cm cables have no chance. should i mount it backwards, cables front of the rack? xd
[19:31:47] <moo> unvr PRO has them in front 
[19:32:11] <Myself> just use a short DAC and an SFP+ genderchanger to relocate the optics to the front 
[19:32:50] <Myself> I'm joking but now I'm sorta curious if that would work, and I'm designing a PCB with an SFP footprint on it right now, I could easily throw another such perversion into the order...
[19:32:58] <moo> i actually just use rj45 and its fine with 8 cameras, but the design is just silly

[19:36:49] <Myself> the way I store cords is I double 'em over, double double double until there's a short enough bundle to tie in a loose single-overhand knot. All the flex has been taken up so these knots can be tossed in a pile and they don't flex enough to tangle with each other. 
[19:37:11] <moo> that sounds like breaking protocol
[19:37:14] <Myself> Or for really delicate stuff, coil and ziploc
[19:37:30] <moo> you should stuff them into overflowing drawer and then once a year empty the drawer into bigger box
[19:37:57] <Myself> nah if I'm stuffing cords into my drawers, it's because someone tipped for it

[20:27:15] <ThePendulum> better?
[20:27:46] <Myself> or it's only an extra $2 but it means they never have to wonder whether a given recording is gonna fit on the little stick or if they have to use the big one. A little extra cost could be worth it for the simplicity
[20:28:12] <ThePendulum> maybe, the file is about 1,5GB though, it's fairly generous
[20:28:29] <Myself> like if some family brings a DVD of transferred videos and other memories, and wants that included in the stick that's handed to all the attendees, it could easily consume a 2GB or whatever
