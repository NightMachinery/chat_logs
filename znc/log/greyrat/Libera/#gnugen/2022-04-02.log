[00:27:26] <jonas[m]> guess we should do the same with the applications we are hosting:¬†https://blog.codeberg.org/lets-bring-codeberg-to-the-cloud.html ü§î that would solve some issues such as datacenter access afontain üòâ
[00:43:47] <afontain[m]> sounds great
[00:44:03] <afontain[m]> maybe we should start with a kite though ?
[00:45:55] <afontain[m]> and then we can deploy many of them, so we can have one microservice on each, and use mesh networking to get them to communicate
[00:46:03] <afontain[m]> easy scalability !
[00:48:56] <Orbstheorem> I would love to see GNU provide a k8s control plane for users to have fun in.
[00:49:05] <Orbstheorem> "Instead of ssh access on rainbowdash"
[00:50:07] <Orbstheorem> `kubectl apply -f` is much more ergonomic than `make && make install PREFIX=~/pkgs`
[00:50:14] <Orbstheorem> (or `nix shell` for that matter)
[00:50:17] <afontain[m]> I believe that could be possible now that we have user namespaces on rainbowdash ?
[00:50:46] <Orbstheorem> Oh, you have no idea how far we are...
[00:51:00] <Orbstheorem> I remember the first time I tried to deploy an control plane on a VM...
[00:51:25] <Orbstheorem> Or rather, the call that went along the all-nighter...
[00:51:50] <afontain[m]> Orbstheorem: I guess?
[00:51:57] <afontain[m]> never used kubernets
[00:52:06] <afontain[m]> * never used kubernetes
[00:54:29] <Orbstheorem> Something [like this](https://gitlab.com/agepoly/it/infra/ansible/-/commit/a44d42fee52c04c232140e904cbf300afb540bc2)
[00:55:35] <Orbstheorem> Wait, actually, before that we had a python script that never made it to the repo.
[00:55:49] <Orbstheorem> And very soon after we got silhouette :D
[00:56:28] <afontain[m]> yeah but like, is the k8s setup more complicated than podman for example?
[00:58:55] <Orbstheorem> Completely orthogonal.
[01:00:23] <Orbstheorem> k8s is a control plane, podman is an OCI backend.
[01:40:19] <afontain[m]> doesn't really explain how what you wanted to setup is more complicated
[01:41:22] <Orbstheorem> Oh, I misread, I thought you meant "than with podman"
[01:41:27] <Orbstheorem> Sorry.
[01:41:55] <Orbstheorem> Podman is pretty much apt install podman.
[01:42:04] <Orbstheorem> Everything else is 'optional' and nice to have.
[01:43:04] <Orbstheorem> kubectl generates a lot of stateful stuff, so you have to init it 'by hand'.
[01:43:25] <Orbstheorem> I remember having many preflight check errors.
[01:43:56] <Orbstheorem> Also, it really doesn't like running in a VM, I don't exactly remember why
[01:53:38] <ayekat> VMs as k8s nodes is pretty normal, no? or do I misread that
[02:15:23] <afontain[m]> <Orbstheorem> "kubectl generates a lot of..." <- well, if that's up to the user to do, that's not my problem :P
[02:16:43] <afontain[m]> idk if we have kvm though üßê
[02:16:50] <Orbstheorem> <ayekat> "VMs as k8s nodes is pretty..." <- Yes, afaik it's normal, but I recall our 'default' proxmox VM config being a problem.
[02:17:22] <Orbstheorem> afontain[m]: I don't think k8s can run in a namespace.
[02:17:40] <Orbstheorem> I would be very surprised.
[03:18:05] <CedricHlzl[t][m]> Qqun peut unlock mon compte gitlab ? üôÜ fail de mdp 2-3 fois üôà
[03:18:25] <CedricHlzl[t][m]> s/üôà/(keepass a oubli√© de sync)/
[09:46:50] <sunyibo> Should I use termux from F-Droid?
[10:06:44] <sunyibo> So I have a nice setup with a public server through which I access a wireguard network of my various computers. On one of those nodes I have a "git server". Setting up my android to access the wireguard network and have "Password Store" sync my passwords is giving me a headache. On the other hand, I'm reluctant to expose a git repo with my (encrypted) passwords on my public server due to security
[10:06:45] <sunyibo> concerns. Are these justified?
[10:09:00] <ayekat> Orbstheorem: ah, I had a case where docker swarm would fail to properly connect nodes to a cluster because of the choice in the VMs network adapter type (was something else than `e1000e`)
[10:09:04] <ayekat> haven't debugged it further, so maybe unrelated, but potentially network namespacing (or otherwise container stuff) can be picky about that sort of thing, in which case I can imagine k8s also running into trouble there
[10:10:36] <ayekat> sunyibo: I have my password-store repo on my Git repo out there in the wild - as long as ssh access is only possible via public key authentication, I don't an issue really
[10:14:35] <ayekat> (I mean, reducing attack surface is always a good thing, but... there's already two layers of security, one being SSH, the other being GPG -- but maybe someone has a different opinion on this)
[10:27:34] <afontain[m]> sunyibo: ro or rw access ?
[10:30:49] <afontain[m]> I would say I understand your concern even for ro, and I'm actually not syncing my password store at all.
[10:32:24] <afontain[m]> however, I would say ssh keys are pretty solid, so that if someone wants to crack your security, the best way would be to attack your phone, which has the keys anyway?
[10:32:59] <afontain[m]> so I'd say if that key is ro is should be mostly fine
