[10:17:17] <blau> paulo, no
[10:17:20] <Modx3> now other miners somehow know that his block conatian manipulated transactions and will ignore his block and create new blocks and other parties on the network will consensus on the longer chain
[10:17:46] <Modx3> so the questions is:

[10:19:15] <as2334> ?
[10:19:37] <as2334> the only thing a miner can attempt is a double spend
[10:19:41] <Evolver> Modx3: don't fall into the trap of talking to as2334

[10:20:26] <as2334> deciving, how?
[10:21:00] <Modx3> r u fucking dumb
[10:21:06] <as2334> ...
[10:21:20] <as2334> looks like you are
[10:21:46] <as2334> invalid transactions are automatically rejected - like I said, the only way to 'deceive' anybody is to try a double spend
[10:21:53] <paulo> ^
[10:22:00] <Modx3> someone could possiblay remove a transaction
[10:22:36] <paulo> a miner can choose to exclude a transaction, but that wouldn't make economic sense because he'll miss out on txn fees
[10:22:55] <as2334> it's not clear what you mean by 'remove a transaction'
[10:22:58] <paulo> even if this miner chooses to exclude, the next miner will most likely include it
[10:25:25] <Modx3> alice and bob are friends alice is a miner bob pay 100 btc to buy something alice exclude bob transactions

[10:26:35] <as2334> Modx3, that can be done, but it doesn't work long term.
[10:26:36] <paulo> a third miner, charlie, will include bob's transactions
[10:26:37] <Modx3> double spend?
[10:27:08] <as2334> Modx3, yes, pay for something, but then like you say 'exclude' the payment
[10:27:14] <Modx3> alice already created the block
[10:27:49] <paulo> charlie will include it in the next block
[10:28:52] <as2334> Modx3, if you're going to recive a 100 bitcoins payment then you wait for a few blocks after the transaction is included, so that it can't be reverted

[10:33:11] <Modx3> when this will happen?
[10:33:33] <paulo> forks happen when two miners create a block at almost the same time
[10:33:55] <paulo> eventually a miner will choose to build on one fork.
[10:34:12] <paulo> then that "longer" fork becomes the main fork

[10:44:55] <Modx3> how other miners will validate ur hash and build on top of ur block
[10:46:15] <Modx3> as2334 paulo
[10:46:48] <Modx3> and when the ll ignore it?
[10:47:04] <as2334> Modx3, for a block to be valid it needs more than a valid hash. All the transactions need to be valid too.
[10:48:52] <Modx3> so u can't create unvalid block ?
[10:49:02] <paulo> nodes will drop it
[10:49:04] <paulo> and not propagate
[10:49:16] <as2334> Modx3, your invalid block will simply be ignored
[10:49:29] <Modx3> how do they know it is invalid ?
[10:49:50] <as2334> Modx3, because it doesn't follow any of a list of rules.
[10:50:17] <as2334> Modx3, let's say you create a block paying yourself 100 bitcoins as the block reward
[10:50:54] <as2334> Modx3, current block reward is ~6 bitcoins tho, so the network will ignore your block.
[10:53:15] <as2334> Modx3, it's possible for a miner to try to cheat, but the way to cheat doesn't use invalid blocks.

[10:54:37] <Modx3> what are the list of rules?
[10:54:47] <as2334> Modx3, what alice would do is publish one block with certain payments, and then publish two blocks (a longer chain) in which that payment doesn't exist.
[10:54:56] <as2334> certain payment(
[10:55:04] <as2334> payment* damn it
[10:55:17] <as2334> Modx3, there are many rules...
[10:55:35] <as2334> Modx3, block size, valid transactions. valid block reward, etc
[10:56:42] <Modx3> what alice would do is publish one block with certain payments, and then publish two blocks (a longer chain) in which that payment doesn't exist.
[10:56:48] <Modx3> what happen next
[10:57:28] <paulo> publishing two blocks fast is difficult: you need majority hashrate to do that
[10:57:59] <paulo> you're basically describing a payment reversal attack via 51% hashpower
[10:58:03] <as2334> Modx3, what happens is that whoever received the first payments now sees the payment disappear. He's been chetaed.
[10:58:10] <as2334> first payment*
[10:58:40] <as2334> paulo, yeah that's the only way you can manipulate the system
[11:00:00] <as2334> i'm not aware of any other method to cheat...
[11:00:12] <Modx3> paulo: theres a pobability of that happening with out owning 51
[11:00:41] <as2334> yeah you don't need 51%
[11:01:10] <as2334> but, again, for any big payment people are supposed to wait for a certain number of blocks to be mined
