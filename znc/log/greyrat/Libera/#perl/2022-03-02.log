[05:25:06] <Grinnz> correct. the first statement i showed splits it into a list and puts that list into an array
[05:25:21] <Grinnz> you could do that in the same line instead, and not use an array, but i figured it was simpler that way
[05:25:51] <Grinnz> you need to do two splits, first to split into lines and then into fields for each line

[22:11:27] <simcop2387> ... this is not a headline i could have ever expected, predicted, or even come up with as fiction: Ukrainian authorities have informed citizens that you don't need to declare captured Russian tanks or any equipment they pick up as personal income
[22:11:57] <huf> they're going to sell some of that shit back to the russian army eventually
[22:12:48] <R2robot> that's pretty funny because this morning I watched a video of a farmer with a tractor towing a tank he stole. lol
[22:13:03] <simcop2387> huf: maybe not, apparently a lot of old german ones got converted to tractors

[22:13:19] <simcop2387> R2robot: is that the one with the soldier running after it?
[22:13:24] <R2robot> yeah
[22:13:35] <huf> does it have the benny hill music under it?
[22:13:46] <R2robot> it didn't, but it would have been perfect. lol
[22:14:33] <kjetilho> simcop2387: fake news - there is a cap of 800 000 dollars, if you have tanks worth more than that you have to pay.
[22:15:41] <huf> :D
[22:15:55] <EvanCarroll> If you had to declare them you'd probably not want to take them. Seeing as the Russians are going to want them back, and they'll be the taxing authority soon.

[22:17:40] <EvanCarroll> 800k dollars is like all the rubles today.

[22:18:22] <EvanCarroll> That central bank heist is going to push Russia into a war with NATO.
[22:18:41] <EvanCarroll> These sanctions are nuts. Only slightly less so then the talk about a no-fly-zone.
[22:18:55] <simcop2387> it's still war, but it honestly feels a bit weirder because of the massive amount of footage coming out of it compared to basically any other war i'm aware of
[22:19:20] <simcop2387> EvanCarroll: honestly i'm not entirely sure that it was ever not going to end up with a war with nato

[22:25:18] <EvanCarroll> Well, if I had to bet how it was going to end, my money would be on Ted Kaczynski
[22:25:35] <EvanCarroll> accepting a deal with Russia when they're outside of Kyiv
[22:28:25] <EvanCarroll> Seems likely he'll recognize the separtist regions as independent, Crimea as Russia with a right to water, and agree to and accept neutrality and not being a member of EU or NATO. And Russia will accept the previous expanse of NATO. And that'll be the exit.
