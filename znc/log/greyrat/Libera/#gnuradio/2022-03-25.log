[00:05:28] <BarryDuggan[m]> Marcin Puchlik: see what I did in https://github.com/duggabe/gr-control as far as putting the Source and Sink in the same flowgraph. mine is half duplex, but it doesn't have to be. the requirement is that the Source and Sink must be in the same flowgraph.

[17:41:03] <madhu_97[m]> <funkylab[m]> "madhu_97: I'm not sure what kind..." <- I have transmitted a 2.7GHz audio signal using HackRF  and GNU radio Block. I have attached the block diagram here which is used for transmission. but I observed the receiving signal using SDR console and listen to that audio signal. now I want to  observe that received signal using GNU blocks and save the received frequency value

[17:44:56] <funkylab[m]> so, what *is* the "detected frequency value" to you? That's what's not quite clear to me :)
[17:48:47] <madhu_97[m]> funkylab[m]: received frequency value
[17:49:22] <funkylab[m]> you keep repeating that word, but you don't receive frequency values. You receive a time-domain signal. I feel like I'm really missing what you want to tell me! 
[17:50:48] <funkylab[m]> I might really be a bit dense here, this is about FM. Do you want to know how to build an FM demodulator?
[17:51:59] <Kevin-phasewrap[> Are you trying to track the transmitted signals deviation from the ‚Äútruth‚Äù?
[17:53:20] <madhu_97[m]> yes
[17:53:41] <madhu_97[m]> Kevin-phasewrap[: yes..
[17:55:20] <funkylab[m]> wow! Interesting. Quantifying error in analog modulations is actually a pretty interesting topic, I find!
[17:57:01] <funkylab[m]> madhu_97: really cool! This basically then says to solve this, you need to do two things:
[17:57:01] <funkylab[m]> 1. find a way to have the "truth"
[17:57:01] <funkylab[m]> 2. find a way to measure the deviation of received signal from truth
[17:58:12] <madhu_97[m]> funkylab[m]: yes..that is the thing I want
[17:58:20] <funkylab[m]> cool!
[17:58:56] <funkylab[m]> then I'd recommend you replace the WBFM in your transmitter by its components
[18:00:33] <funkylab[m]> You can find what WBFM Transmit does internally by clicking on "Python files" on https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/WBFM_Transmit
[18:00:33] <funkylab[m]> The internal signal processing blocks in WBFM Transit are just interpolation (if necessary) -> pre-emphasis filter -> frequency modulator
[18:01:56] <funkylab[m]> If I understand you correctly, you'd want to compare, at the receiver, what an equivalently parameterized frequency demodulator (which shape ever that takes, let's talk about that separately) outputs, compared to what you input into your frequency modulator
[18:02:38] <funkylab[m]> Be very aware that this is not only a result of the received signal, but very importantly of the method which you use to as your frequency demodulator!
[18:03:41] <funkylab[m]> Then, you'd have two sequences of numbers, the values that went into frequency modulator, and those coming out of frequency demodulator, that you could compare.
[18:03:59] <funkylab[m]> Question is: what kind of comparison matters to you? When you get these two sequences, what would you want to do with them, madhu_97?
[18:14:33] <madhu_97[m]> <funkylab[m]> "Question is: what kind of..." <- I want to get the detection probability of each HackRF sensors 
[18:14:56] <funkylab[m]> um, what do you want to detect?
[18:15:05] <funkylab[m]> that's a very different question than how to detect a frequency deviation
[18:26:43] <madhu_97[m]> First I wil transmit a signal using a one HackRF then I want to receive it using another HackRFs. Then I want to get the deviation
[18:38:46] <funkylab[m]> but how  is that related to a detection probability? I'm really confused now.
[18:39:32] <funkylab[m]> measuring the deviation is something else than determining whether it's there or not. The latter, however, is what we describe with "detection probability"
[18:40:50] <Kevin-phasewrap[> madhu_97: are you trying to benchmark the HackRFs or measure something about the channel?
[18:42:19] *** madhu_97[m] is now known as some[m]
[18:48:37] <funkylab[m]> or are you trying to observe the performance of some frequency estimation algorithm?
[18:48:42] <some[m]> > <@funkylab:gnuradio.org> madhu_97: really cool! This basically then says to solve this, you need to do two things:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/a943ab4e7ed1a123348f04fea83e9f8020d7a4b9)
[18:49:05] <funkylab[m]> I addressed that already!
[18:50:28] <funkylab[m]> <funkylab[m]> "then I'd recommend you replace..." <- this is where I describe how you get the ground truth to compare to
[18:51:31] <funkylab[m]> @madhu_97:gnuradio.org: we, however, really can't tell you how your metric of deviation looks! That depends on what *you* mean when you say "deviation". Can you put that into a formula, that gives a single number when you insert two sequences, the ground truth and the frequency estimates?
