[02:00:27] <Blondie101010> Sid18:  to get that result, you'll need much more explicit parsing 
[02:01:11] <Blondie101010> like the fieldName ends before a ":"
[02:01:50] <Blondie101010> the value is after ": " and before "$"
[02:02:31] <nitro_> except for mod: , thats midline
[02:02:58] <Blondie101010> or is it? :P
[02:03:07] <Blondie101010> oh yes
[02:03:18] <Blondie101010> didn't catch where you got that, but now I did
[02:03:30] <Blondie101010> that's making it more complicated
[02:05:26] <Blondie101010> so an inter-field rule would be that its value ends before "$" or "\s\w+:"
[02:05:49] <nitro_> or one word after :
[02:06:01] <Blondie101010> nope
[02:06:08] <nitro_> damn, that wouldnt work for err

[20:29:51] <Blondie101010> as any peer community support, it depends on who is present/available at the moment and on your question
[20:30:40] <Blondie101010> I just looked at your link, and you didn't include any delimiters to define the target word
[20:31:38] <Blondie101010> is the first delimiter always "Part \b+ - "?
[20:31:49] <Blondie101010> is the first delimiter always "Part \d+ - "?
[20:32:53] <Blondie101010> that's how you need to build it.... please apply at least that and try to improve it a bit, and repost if it still doesn't work for you
[20:33:41] <re101-hyena-31> I applied that https://regex101.com/r/jRkfRO/4
[20:33:46] <re101-hyena-31> has an error
[20:34:30] <digitok> do you want to match both of those lines or just part 2
[20:34:56] <re101-hyena-31> both lines
[20:35:11] <NoImNotNineVolt> - Part \d+ - (.*?) - \d+ Pools.xlsx
[20:35:18] <NoImNotNineVolt> capture group 1.
[20:35:25] <re101-stoat-15> How can I delimiter this regex to do not apply to the second match, only the first one?  https://regex101.com/r/Jd4N9s/1
[20:36:18] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/jRkfRO/5
[20:36:21] <NoImNotNineVolt> re101-stoat-15: add ^ to the start.
[20:36:37] <re101-stoat-15> whoa, thanks
[20:37:16] <re101-hyena-31> What does it mean capture group 1?
[20:38:21] <NoImNotNineVolt> re101-stoat-15: capture groups can be used to extract only part of a match.
[20:39:13] <re101-stoat-15> the ^ did the job, thanks
[20:39:17] <NoImNotNineVolt> but that was directed at Blondie101010 :P
[20:39:22] <NoImNotNineVolt> yup, any time.

[20:51:47] <Blondie101010> did you read the two last links I gave you?
[20:52:31] <re101-eagle-17> Question for Reg folks 
[20:52:51] <re101-eagle-17> how can I modify this regex rule?
[20:52:58] <re101-eagle-17> (?=[^.]*\b(The request to continue the discovery cutoff is denied as moot.)\b) 
[20:53:23] <Blondie101010> re101-eagle-17: modify it to do what differently?
[20:53:25] <re101-eagle-17> I want to catch the sentences have that expersion end with " moot."
[20:54:00] <re101-eagle-17> I cannot define the . at the end of the sentences in thhat rule
[20:54:09] <Blondie101010> that's unclear...  can you please make a few test cases on https://regex101.com/
[20:54:25] <Blondie101010> '.' is matched with '
[20:54:33] <Blondie101010> '\.' in regex
[20:55:59] <re101-hyena-31> Blondie - yes what you provided worked Thank you!
[20:56:37] <Blondie101010> no problem
[20:57:21] <re101-eagle-17> I'm looking to find the exact matches with python 
[20:57:29] <re101-eagle-17> for this sentence 
[20:57:31] <re101-eagle-17> The request to continue the discovery cutoff is denied as moot.
[20:57:38] <re101-eagle-17> this is my rule
[20:57:46] <re101-eagle-17> (?=[^.]*\b(The request to continue the discovery cutoff is denied as moot\.)\b) 
[20:57:48] <Blondie101010> so just replace the . with \.
[20:58:07] <Blondie101010> ok so what cases does it not work with?  please show it on the site
[20:58:35] <Blondie101010> that's actually the best way to troubleshoot it yourself (like everyone does, including experts)
[20:59:03] <Blondie101010> then if you get stuck, you can show us where with the link by clicking save
[20:59:27] <re101-eagle-17> Nice

[21:00:37] <re101-eagle-17> I always use regex101 to write and test the rules. This one was  a little confusing

[22:55:44] <re101-bat-12> hey, i'm a regex noob and i'm trying to format a text document. I'm trying to find all instances where an [a-z] character is next to a \n character, and replace it with the same character and a [space]
[22:55:53] <re101-bat-12> is that possible
[22:56:12] <re101-bat-12> i'm using notepad++
[22:56:41] <yitz> re101-bat-12: [a-z]$
[22:59:08] <re101-bat-12> no dice
[23:00:34] <re101-bat-12> that finds the character but it doesn't replace it
[23:01:29] <re101-bat-12> i'm looking for "[a-z]\n" and replacing it with "[a-z]$ "
[23:01:32] <re101-bat-12> is that right
[23:09:58] <yitz> re101-bat-12: search for   [a-z]$
[23:10:10] *** Quits: d1cor (~diego@179.63.242.100) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[23:10:25] <re101-bat-12> ok, what should i replace it with
[23:11:38] <yitz> Eh. That's a separate problem. Does Notepad++ support references in replacements?
[23:12:01] <re101-bat-12> i think so
[23:13:26] <re101-bat-12> yes, it seems to
[23:14:06] <yitz> Then search for   ([a-z])$ and replace with the capture group/reference and a space
[23:15:53] <re101-bat-12> what might that capture group reference look like
[23:16:08] <re101-bat-12> this is already incredibly helpful
[23:16:32] <Blondie101010> how about $1

[23:21:27] <re101-bat-12> thank you all so much!
[23:22:10] <yitz> As a non-Notepad++ user, I wouldn't have a clue how they do references
[23:22:22] <Blondie101010> I just took a guess
