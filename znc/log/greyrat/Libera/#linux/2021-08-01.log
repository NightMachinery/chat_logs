It might have grub commands to load some config from somewhere. If it's not there then it tries to use grub.cfg in the same directory as grubx64.cfg. And that might refer to yet another config.
[00:13:03] <PaulFertser> bin: you can see all the chain of grub configs right from grubx64.efi on the system partition.

[02:03:55] <WeblordPepe> is my understanding right that its kinda up to intel with how much granularity linux can mess with the cpu speed & fan?
[02:04:16] <WeblordPepe> i got an i5 5th gen. i just havent fully gone down the rabbit hole yet.
[02:04:25] <ayecee> in that it's not directly controlled by the operating system, sure, kinda.
[02:04:27] <WeblordPepe> i heard something changed recently but i forgot
[02:04:49] <koollman_> cpu speed, surely that's up to intel. fan speed, I don't think intel is involved much

[02:05:03] <WeblordPepe> hmm

[02:05:20] <WeblordPepe> cos i wanna be all 'dont you dare turn on that CPU fan' and simply throttle down the clock instead
[02:05:36] <PaulFertser> CPU speed can be differently controlled, with CPU-side PSTATES or not. And you can set performance profile manually in any case.
[02:05:42] <WeblordPepe> but for the life of me no govenor or setting seems to do it. i'll actually whinge about it later when i can remember what on earth i did

[02:06:11] <PaulFertser> Intel also has TDP limits for short peaks and long averages and you can sometimes change them if your cooling is really nice.
[02:06:20] <WeblordPepe> oh man whats idle injection? is it what i think it sounds like? cos it sounds awesome
[02:06:30] <ayecee> there was a program that configured that, let me see if i can remember it.
[02:06:53] <PaulFertser> The TDP thing in intel is called RAPL and there're tools that can change it via MSR.

[05:12:30] <mawk> it means "stop parsing options"

[07:18:00] <domhnall> well, your 'real' question...having an issue associated with it.
[07:18:41] <addajones> ah just if anybody has it running and enjoys it and finds it very useable? was trying to find more live info instead of on blogs etc before I try it on my MacBook Air
[07:18:49] <Psi-Jack> addajones: Why would anyone want to?
[07:19:04] <addajones> @jochum thanks
[07:19:11] <addajones> Psi-Jack very true
[07:19:16] <Psi-Jack> heh
[07:19:35] <Psi-Jack> I mean, I'd literally buy a MacBook Air M1, just for the macOS on M1.
[07:19:56] <domhnall> personally, if I had an m1, I'd keep the os it came with.
[07:20:04] <domhnall> or, what Psi-Jack said
[07:20:07] <jochum> birkoff: it looks like the fuse process is gone the mount isn't (crash)
[07:20:08] <birkoff> so there I had a tmux pane inside that folder, I cd''ed out of it, umounted it with umount and then mounted it with ntfs-3g -o force and it's back again; with stale files hanging but ok

[07:22:51] <jochum> Psi-Jack: yeah, I googled a bit more thought a bit...
[07:23:04] <jochum> Psi-Jack: end is - no clue ;P
[07:23:29] <Psi-Jack> Well, Got my RockyLinux 8 "Box"
[07:23:40] <Psi-Jack> I'm actually kinda liking GNOME Boxes.
[07:24:11] <jochum> Yet another interface to libvirt - but one that works?
[07:24:24] <Khaytsus> Gnome Boxes is like that 'special' dog.  It's still a dog, but something ain't right with it.
[07:24:29] <Psi-Jack> virt-manager, virsh, and boxes all work.
[07:24:40] <Khaytsus> virt-manager is great, pisses me off RH is deprecating it.
[07:24:47] <Psi-Jack> Khaytsus: WHAT!?!?
[07:24:53] <sheep> what is it being replaced with?
[07:24:58] <Khaytsus> ....  cockpit
[07:25:03] <Dagmar> THey've decided they'd rather push people into using the web interface that is cockpit

[07:25:39] <Psi-Jack> sheep: Well, I mean, I do THAT all the time.
[07:25:54] <sheep> I mostly use libvirt for desktop VMs
[07:26:08] <jochum> Means we have to use Virtualbox on Desktop?

[10:23:49] <ayecee> find doesn't do that itself, but it can call grep to do it. like, find . -name '*.conf' -exec grep -q here {} \; -print
[10:24:49] <arash> ayecee, thank you. what . means in this command ? it means all files ?
[10:25:16] <ayecee> it means current directory.

[10:28:06] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@106.203.221.241)
[10:31:00] <ayecee> in this case, grep -q makes grep silent, and we use the exit status to detect a match. this lets us string together other find options, e.g. -print can be replaced with another -exec or a -delete.
[10:31:13] <n4dir> the *.conf files are found in subdirectories too? else grep itself would suffice, i think
[10:31:49] <n4dir> there is also recursive grep, but i wouldn't know how to make it match against .*conf only
[10:31:55] <ayecee> if you just want to find matching files, sure. if you want to do something with the matches, this works better.
[10:32:13] <n4dir> and it will sure impress the ladies too. :-)
[10:32:17] <ayecee> :D
[10:32:47] <n4dir> just saying as not sure what exactly he wants. I prefer stuff i can easily remember, and find ... well, not easy to remember if i use it seldom
[10:33:12] <ayecee> grep + xargs could also work for doing stuff with the matches, if you're careful.

[10:33:57] <n4dir> well, he seems happy. And there is always a find-master around, it seems
[10:34:24] <Psi-Jack> Well, grep itself traversing subdirectories would start incorporating all files, not just *.conf
[10:34:28] <arash> ayecee, and if i want to search for all file types can i replace *.conf with *.* ? i mean instead of searching for conf file i want to search in all of the extensions like txt
[10:35:09] <ayecee> arash: it would be better to replace -name '*.conf' with -type f
[10:35:24] <ayecee> that matches all files, without matching directories
[10:35:36] <n4dir> i think it that case grep -r as in recursive should do the job too

[13:03:10] <gzuh> on stadia
[13:03:52] <pnbeast> arash, memory is divided into segments.  A program can access segments of memory if the kernel allows it, but if a program tries to access a segment that it is not allowed to access, it gets a fault, instead:  a segfault.

[14:14:13] <famubu> Hi. If we are using a web browser that works from the terminal likey lynx, are the things that have no use for a terminal browser (like javascript) still downloaded (and discarded since it is of no use) or are they not even downloaded? Any idea?

[14:19:54] <Sauvin> That depends on what you want to store, and how. ntfs doesn't know a damn thing about Linux permissions.
[14:20:27] <JonBardo> To be fair I also had problems with the drive in windows, so its probably a problem with the drive
[14:20:32] <Sauvin> What kinds of problems with ext4 did you have? I have externals formatted ext4 and have zero trouble with them.

I have attempted to create bootable usb from many distributions such as (Debian, Fedora, Manjaro, Slackware, Ubuntu) with no success, when I enter in to my boot menu the USB doesnt even appear as a bootable device. I have dissabled fastboot, secure boot etc. In order to create
[16:41:23] <yakiza> the bootable USB I have tried to use dd and also unebootin. Unebootin did yield some results with slackware but not with the others ( fedora is my focus). My Motherboard is Asus Prime with the latest bios update. I am not sure why I am unable to see any of my bootable USB's any help is much appretiated.
