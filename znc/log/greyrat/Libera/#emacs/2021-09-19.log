[22:45:34] <asgas> What's weird is going on is that I have been trying to set a global variable (setq foo 100) yet when I try to message or print it, it says foo is void.
[22:46:18] <trs-80> how are you calling it?

[22:47:59] <asgas> Ok, I see what went wrong. I didn't sexp the list to make foo equal 100, so it was still technically an empty variable when I asked emacs to print the value of foo.
[22:48:56] <trs-80> Not sure what you are trying to do, but the idiomatic way would be to do your function within a let form (perhaps)
[22:49:34] <trs-80> if you only need foo bound during the duration of the function (remember Emacs has a single global namespace)
