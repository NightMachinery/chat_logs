[02:06:41] <Klinda> tensoflow created the tensor arrays
[02:06:48] <Klinda> and then the other frameworks copy them ?
[02:07:18] <HuntsMan> hahaha no
[02:07:22] <HuntsMan> tensors are very old math concepts
[02:07:28] <HuntsMan> ever hear of theano?
[02:07:33] <HuntsMan> or even numpy?
[02:07:55] *** Quits: Codaraxis_ (~Codaraxis@user/codaraxis) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[02:08:25] <Klinda> numpy yes
[02:08:44] <Klinda> it's a python library that exploit C stuff to make it faster
[02:08:45] <HuntsMan> numpy has tensors
[02:09:00] <Klinda> ah ok
[02:09:03] <theseb> are you saying pytorch is built on top of tensorflow code?
[02:09:20] <Klinda> no no I just see tensors in pytorch
[02:09:29] <Klinda> and there is the other framework called tensorflow
[02:09:36] <Klinda> my intution was that ahaha
[02:09:41] <HuntsMan> no, I am saying they did not invent the concept
[02:09:45] <theseb> right
[02:09:55] <Klinda> yes I understand HuntsMan
[02:10:00] <theseb> If OpenAI picked pytorch is must be good
[02:10:05] <theseb> maybe i should look into it
[02:10:25] <theseb> everyone always talks about TensorFlow so i just assumed it was head and shoulders best
[02:10:28] <theseb> plus Google made it
[02:10:35] <Klinda> my teacher shared that links to say "let's learn pytorch"
[02:11:21] <Klinda> is openai a good company theseb?

[02:21:12] <theseb> HuntsMan: in order to get funding i thought everyone always claims they're creating the next HAL/Skynet/C3P0 in 5 years
[02:23:35] <HuntsMan> theseb: ever heard of neural winters?
[02:24:01] <HuntsMan> too much hype can kill the field
[02:24:18] <theseb> HuntsMan: yup
[02:24:50] <theseb> HuntsMan: look at the date on this ancient quote... "The Navy revealed the embryo of an electronic computer today that it expects will be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence." — New York Times, July 8, 1958
[02:25:04] <HuntsMan> yeah, so?
[02:25:11] <HuntsMan> they were wrong, and funding dried up
[02:25:15] <HuntsMan> we don't want that to happen again
[02:25:30] <theseb> i think we've had multiple AI winters
[02:25:34] <HuntsMan> yes
[02:25:45] <theseb> deep learning will obviously lead to one eventually
[02:26:09] <theseb> we're currently in the AI Spring so to speak of deep learning

[15:35:14] <Klinda> I ask him what's the difference between the frameworks and that's what it said: What's the difference in detail? PyTorch is a Python library that provides two high-level features: Tensor computation with strong GPU acceleration Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system TensorFlow is a Python library for data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning. It is also a symbolic math program used for high-performance
[15:35:16] <Klinda> numerical computation. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.
