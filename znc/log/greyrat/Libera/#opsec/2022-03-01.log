[01:39:33] <jan6> quite interesting talk
[01:40:18] <jan6> hololeap: well, depends how cheap, any price can be too much for someone, and for some purpose ;P
[01:40:47] <jan6> and always remember, more POSSIBILITIES does not equal more successful things, either
[01:42:10] <jan6> and you never heard about all the countless failed ideas and projects, at least not unless they're done by some ultra-rich and/or (un)popular person/company
[01:43:40] <hololeap> fair, but we need to pull from our repository of self-determination to understand what is possible. we have a lot of power in our local domain
[01:46:29] <jan6> nearly anything's possible
[01:46:46] <jan6> you just need the skill, determination, and money to do the thing
[01:46:57] <jan6> possibly workforce too
[01:51:45] <hololeap> yeah
[01:52:44] <hololeap> gotta teach the younguns that this is important
[01:53:29] <hololeap> they will understand it instinctually

[02:12:40] <Joanna> Hi everyone

[02:14:12] <Joanna> hololeap: I think the default behavior for most people is to be lazy and copy.
[02:19:29] <Joanna> The lack of diversity in home builders and building codes doesn’t help. In the good old days when every part of the world had its own building styles everything was less centralized. If anything, all the buildings looking the same is a symptom of a much bigger problem of lack of local autonomy. It definitely is ridiculous how all the cheap fossil fuel which has made building things easier than any other time in history has not had 
[02:19:29] <Joanna> good results in most cases.

[02:23:15] <Joanna> Hi inky welcome back
[02:24:51] <jan6> 00:44 <Joanna> hololeap: I think the default behavior for most people is to be lazy and copy.
[02:25:01] <jan6> there *IS* no creativity that isn't just copying ;P
[02:25:47] <jan6> you copy from nature, you copy from other people, you copy from yourself, it's all copying
[02:27:31] <jan6> also uh, no, all buildings looking same is a result of 1) that style being cheap, and 2) big building corps being able to leverage economies of scale, and existing blueprints, to copy-paste the same style all around and 3) those same corps being international, often enough
[02:29:09] <jan6> and 4) building codes setting the baseline for how cheap people can get away with, can cause buildings to converge into a style that's cheap and valid for the most amount of places, because of corps from 2) doing that

[02:30:28] <jan6> also also, old style houses might have been made quality construction, but they often also took a *LONG* time to build, and nowdays people care about cheaply done stuff that's "good enough", not stuff that's gonna last for several generations

[15:52:39] <_inky> Joanna: we have our hostages. we afraid to say anything that condemns the war. i am afraid of hanging ukrainian flag from my balcony. i know every photo of that may anger putin, and then we all will pay, our relatives in artsakh or near borders will pay because of his revenge.
[15:53:08] <Joanna> _inky: have you ever visited Ukraine?
[15:53:15] <_inky> no.
[15:53:23] <_inky> i have many friends from there though.
[15:53:29] <_inky> and i feel them very close.
[15:53:49] <Joanna> Are they in the russian regions?
[15:54:21] <_inky> we speak the same language (russian), i saw many urkainian movies, animations, apparently half of my activity pub (decentralized social network) contacts are from ukraine.
[15:54:39] <_inky> they all were writing in russian, because it's a language that covers more auditory, and they can communicate with their russian friends.
[15:54:59] <_inky> like i have another account for english language to communicate with english speaking world, internationally.
[15:55:12] <_inky> so russian is an international language in the post soviet space.
[15:55:18] <Joanna> What do you think of all the previous handiwork of nato such as war in Yugoslavia?
[15:55:29] <_inky> so everyone from ukraine i know is writing in russian, and everyone hates putin and the invasion.
[15:56:24] <_inky> i think it was necessary measures to stop the war and war crime.
[15:56:37] *** Parts: SANCLA (~SANCLA@hackalot/deelnemer/Sancla) ()
[15:57:45] <Joanna> There is something very common everyplace on every issue and that is a dichotomy. It is actually a technique of thesis antithesis and synthesis whereby there are two sides of an issue working their way towards an agenda
[15:58:21] <Joanna> What about Libya being destroyed?
[15:58:27] <Joanna> Vietnam?
[15:58:54] <Joanna> Iraq ? Afghanistan? Do you see a pattern here?
[15:59:16] <Joanna> War is a profitable industry
[16:00:56] <Joanna> How about the boer wars in South Africa? The murder of millions of indigenous people in Americas , Australia and Africa by colonialism?

[16:47:46] <irelativism> We hereby announce a new release of Hyperbola live image for Hyperbola GNU/Linux-libre. It is the first release with nondependence on D-Bus and many of the commonly used frameworks dropped.
[16:48:31] <irelativism> This version contains various bugfixes and notable performance
[16:48:45] <irelativism> https://www.hyperbola.info/news/milky-way-v04-release/
[16:48:50] <irelativism> A copyleft alternative to linux kernel is of the upmost importance for our movement during current times. Cheers.
