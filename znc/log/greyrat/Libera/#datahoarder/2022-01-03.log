[04:19:49] <joepie91> well I did get some footage of the "fireworks ban"
[04:20:06] <JTL> sounds like a "ban" alright
[04:20:10] <JTL> ha ha
[04:21:18] <joepie91> https://youtu.be/vBZpb5EQ7Ng
[04:21:32] <joepie91> juicy bit starts around 02:00 iirc
[04:21:34] <evilgohan2> here the joke goes
[04:21:37] <evilgohan2> "fireworks or glock?"
[04:22:01] <evilgohan2> :(
[04:22:31] <joepie91> :(
[04:22:48] <joepie91> but yeah, as you can see and hear, the ban was followed very well
[04:27:02] <joepie91> in hindsight, I should've zoomed more in that video :p
[04:27:38] <evilgohan2> if it was recorded with a phone, and if said phone doesn't have optical zoom equipped, it's  best you didn't 
[04:27:41] <evilgohan2> ijs
[04:28:09] <joepie91> evilgohan2: it's a phone, and it doesn't have optical zoom as far as I know, but the zoomed bits really *do* look better
[04:28:28] <joepie91> dunno, feels like it captured more light somehow
[04:28:34] <evilgohan2> all I'm saying is that someone can use "zoom and enhance" or pinch to zoom and get the same effect :P
[04:28:40] <joepie91> keep in mind there was a lot of fuckery with the focus and ISO setting
[04:28:45] <joepie91> not so sure about that
[04:29:04] <joepie91> it feels like something else is going on
[04:29:26] *** Joins: DrBrownBear (~Drbb@2600:1700:9aa1:6bc0::1f)
[04:29:26] <evilgohan2> interesting
[04:29:31] <joepie91> anyway, it's not like any of the fireworks were gonna be super sharp anyway
[04:29:51] <joepie91> I locked the ISO, and had to adjust the focus manually, with my only real reference point being the occasional early fireworks
[04:30:02] <joepie91> had to adjust the white balance as well
[04:30:21] <joepie91> basically everything locked and configured upfront to get a reasonable video out of it when things went loose :p
[04:30:34] <joepie91> so the focus is prob imperfect
[04:30:42] <evilgohan2> looks okay to me for a night video
[04:31:00] <joepie91> yeah I'm really happy with the overall result
[04:31:09] <joepie91> especially considering it's a budget smartphone lol
[04:31:13] <evilgohan2> indeed
[04:31:24] <evilgohan2> though, to be honest, with the way device costs have gone
[04:31:31] <evilgohan2> anything under $800 usd is probably budget at this point
[04:31:32] <joepie91> like, see 04:50 for example
[04:31:55] <joepie91> no stabilization, digital zoom
[04:31:59] <evilgohan2> refurbed iphones are like $900 right now
[04:32:00] <joepie91> well, I think it's digital
[04:32:06] <joepie91> evilgohan2: yeah but this was literally a 70 EUR phone or so
[04:32:44] <joepie91> and it has an above-average camera for this price tier of phone, but I hadn't expected to get this good a result at night
[04:33:15] <joepie91> 07:30, another example
[04:33:18] <evilgohan2> lmaooooo GPU manufacturers have really stopped caring about power draw if this is to be believed

[04:34:24] <evilgohan2> 7:30: goodness gracious, that's not an official show?
[04:34:29] <evilgohan2> that's absolute madness
[04:34:38] <joepie91> nope, that's consumer fireworks here
[04:34:45] <joepie91> or well
[04:34:50] <joepie91> this particular one was probably from belgium or poland
[04:35:04] <joepie91> but it's not too dissimilar to regular consumer fireworks here
[04:35:23] <evilgohan2> I truly hope no one has PTSD or anything and is being subjected to that
