[00:11:29] <TheWild> my old scientific calculator has a terrible PRNG - every time I reset it and calculate Ran#, it gives 0.225, 0.190, 0.375, 0.641, 0.756, 0.408, 0.406, 0.345... I have not managed to crack it though.
[00:11:36] <int-e> Inline: what do you mean by "end"?

[00:15:51] <Inline> that kind of reflection should be allowed too as a secondary option, but that does not correspond to my usual intuition here
[00:17:26] <int-e> Inline: direction vectors (which I think is the usual meaning of "vector" without qualification) are not attached to a particular starting point; they could be attached anywhere (translating the arrow). So when reflecting them, only the direction of the line of reflection matters.
[00:17:53] <Inline> yes but i specified y-axis as the reflection line

[02:20:49] <Z-module> (typically you see this one cited as jsut for commutative rings, and that form also does imply AC, but commutativity isn't needed for the maximal ideal)
[02:21:24] <greenbagels> Z-module: would the easiest way to show that is equivalent to choice be using Zorn's lemma?

[02:42:34] <Z-module> A nice/easy one is:  Let S mean the additive subgroup of Q having only the elements m/n (in lowest terms) where n is squarefree. So S is a dense subgroup of Q and Q/S is a certain quotient group. If you define an operation * on Q/S using:   [a/b]*[c/d] = [1/2] if b,d are both even, [0] otherwise, then you can check fairly easily that:  * is well defined,  (Q/S, usual +, this new *)  is actually a ring, infinitely many products in this

[04:34:23] <Capso_> Z-module: by |a| = 1 I meant ||a||_1 = 1 which is your sum a_j = 1. And yes, it's just that box

[04:34:45] <Capso_> oh right, I have to exclude w = 0
[04:39:52] <Z-module> pretty sure you get exactly the same result starting from the vertices of any convex polyhedron in R^n whose convex hull's interior (using topology of R^n) contains the origin.
[04:40:04] <Capso_> Z-module: it seems that rather than the closed convex hull, just the surface of the cube would do to cover the sphere; is there a simple description of the type of coefficients I can take?
[04:40:33] <Z-module> yes that works too
[04:41:01] <Z-module> I think that works out to be all the sums in which at least one a_j = 0,  no?
[04:41:05] <Capso_> |a| = 1, a_j > 0 is succinct, but what if I want to restrict to the surface?

[04:51:36] <Capso_> right

[10:48:39] <Fangs> feel free to talk about it, but idk much about num thy
[10:48:55] <Fangs> zacts: so what are residue classes? can you give an example?
[10:49:40] <zacts> "sets of numbers that leave the same remainder (or residue) when divided by the number of numbers in a row."
[10:49:58] <zacts> via writing numbers in rows of 1, 2, 3
[10:50:21] <zacts> "writing numbers in rows reveals the residue classes in columns."
[10:50:23] <zacts> so like:
[10:50:27] <zacts> 0
[10:50:28] <zacts> 1
[10:50:29] <zacts> 2
[10:50:29] <zacts> 3
[10:50:34] <zacts> 01
[10:50:35] <zacts> 23
[10:50:36] <zacts> 45
[10:50:38] <zacts> 67
[10:50:47] <zacts> 012
[10:50:49] <zacts> 345
[10:50:50] <zacts> 678
[10:50:53] <zacts> this kind of idea
[10:51:05] <zacts> I can also move this to offtopic if necessary
[10:51:18] <Fangs> this is mod 1, mod 2, mod 3?
[10:51:19] <zacts> but no one else is chatting at the moment
[10:51:45] <zacts> I'm trying to understand mod
[10:52:14] <Fangs> lets take your third example. 0,3,6 are all in the same class?
[10:52:23] <zacts> yes
[10:52:34] <zacts> the vertical columns are all the same residue class
[10:52:43] <Fangs> ah, ok so [0] = [3] = [6] is how you would notate them usually
[10:53:00] <zacts> are those = signs supposed to be two or three bars?
[10:53:16] *** Joins: gggp (~textual@60.10.194.43)
[10:53:20] <Fangs> where [0] = { n in Z : exists k in Z such that 3*k = n } in this case
[10:53:35] <Fangs> well more genreally
[10:53:46] <Fangs> where [a] = { n in Z : exists k in Z such that 3*k + a = n } in this case
[10:54:08] <zacts> what do the square brackets [ ] mean?
[10:54:11] <Fangs> zacts: these are sets (i.e. 'classes'), so equality is 'fine'.
[10:54:26] <Fangs> zacts: I'm just defining a set, that depends on the input, so to speak
[10:55:21] <zacts> what is the name of that notation?
[10:55:21] <Fangs> 1 ~ 4 (mod 3) where the ~ is usually written as tripple bars of some kind, that's an equivalence relation. in this case these aren't sets, but actual numbers
[10:55:36] <Fangs> people sometimes abuse the notation and just write 1 = 4 (mod 3)
[10:56:01] <Fangs> zacts: idk, sometimes you do that for equivalence classes
[10:56:07] <zacts> ok
[10:56:19] <Fangs> do you know what they are?
[10:56:25] <zacts> 1 ~ 10 ~ 100 ~ 1000 ~ 10000 (mod 9)
[10:56:31] <Fangs> do you know what an equivalence relation is?
[10:56:31] <zacts> ^^ would this be valid notation?
[10:56:36] <Fangs> sure
[10:56:42] *** Quits: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna) (Quit: Leaving)
[10:56:59] <Fangs> how comfortable are you with sets?
[10:57:13] <zacts> not too comfortable
[10:58:03] <Fangs> ok there's a few ways to think about residue classes
[10:59:33] <Fangs> zacts: so strictly speaking with different 'n' in (mod n), you'll have a different equivalence relation.
[10:59:59] <Fangs> to keep track you can write ~ with subscript n, or you can just write (mod n) to the right most of the chain of equivalences
[11:00:08] <Fangs> the latter is what most people use
[11:00:28] <zacts> wait
[11:00:41] <zacts> what does 1 mod 3 mean?
[11:01:13] <Fangs> "a mod b" is not really an operation like it is in programming
[11:01:57] <Fangs> (at least in most uses of mod in maths)
[11:02:10] <Fangs> zacts: the (mod 3) is really saying that we have an equivalence relation, and its "modulo 3"
[11:02:41] <Fangs> zacts: a ~ b (mod 3) if a - b = m*3 for some integer m
[11:02:49] <Fangs> (you can take that as a definition)

[11:06:54] *** Joins: palasso (~palasso@user/palasso)
[11:08:21] <zacts> does "modulo 3" just mean it's evenly divisible by 3?
[11:09:54] <Fangs> zacts: "modulo 3" is a relation between two numbers, saying that their difference is evenly divisible by 3
[11:10:17] <Fangs> 9 ~ 0 (mod 3) is saying the difference between 9 and 0 is evenly divisible by 3
[11:10:24] <Fangs> but 9 (mod 3) doesn't really make sense
[11:10:43] <zacts> a ~ b (kind of means a and b are related in some way) then adding (mod 3) this is how they are related. Is that kind of how I might think of it?
[11:11:10] <Fangs> zacts: the ~ comes with the "(mod 3)"
[11:11:45] <zacts> oh
[11:11:45] <Fangs> the (mod 3) is a reminder what the "~" means.. so a less-abusive notation would be a ~_{(mod 3)} b
[11:11:57] <Fangs> or a ~_3 b
[11:12:07] <zacts> oh cool
[11:12:12] <Fangs> but its really ugly in ASCII and still ugly in LaTeX
[11:12:29] <zacts> yeah, but that helps me to conceptually understand it I think
[11:12:32] <Fangs> yeah
[11:12:45] <zacts> a ~³ b
[11:12:48] <zacts> how about that for now
[11:12:54] <Fangs> yup exactly
[11:14:01] <zacts> can you explain equivalence relations in a nutshell?
[11:15:23] <zacts> like how does this differ from an isomorphism I think it's called?
[11:15:26] <Fangs> zacts: are you comfortable with propositional/predicate logic?
[11:15:34] <zacts> yes, enough
[11:15:50] <zacts> *yes, I understand enough of propositional/predicate logic I feel
[11:16:54] <Fangs> let X  be a set, then if R(_,_) is two-slot predicate on X.. it is an equivalence relation if:
[11:17:06] <Fangs> R(a,a) is always true for all a in X...
[11:17:19] <Fangs> if R(a,b) is true then R(b,a) is true for all a, b in X
[11:17:46] <Fangs> and if R(a,b) is true and R(b,c) is true then R(a,c) is true (for all a b c in X)
[11:18:08] <Fangs> zacts: often people write with infix notation aRb
[11:18:20] <Fangs> now... substitute R with something more suggestive like ~

[11:18:34] <zacts> oh so is that why a ~ b ~ c ~ d ~ e (mod 3) works?
[11:18:41] *** Joins: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn)
[11:18:50] <Fangs> all im saying is: its a symbol so that: a~a is always true, and a ~ b implies b ~ a
[11:19:03] <Fangs> and... if a ~ b and b ~ c then a ~ c
[11:19:35] <Fangs> zacts: you technically should prove that your definition of "foo ~ bar (mod 3)" satisfies the equivalence relation axioms/properties
[11:19:58] <Fangs> but these axioms is just to make sure you can treat ~ as if you would treat equalities normally
[11:20:51] <Fangs> zacts: that's what I meant by "you may take: [a ~ b (mod 3) iff there exists integer m so that a - b = m*3] as a definition"

[12:13:50] <zacts> interesting
[12:13:59] <zacts> note: let me know if I should move my discussion to off-topic.
[12:14:22] <zacts> ok, I'm looking at these residue classes
[12:15:01] <zacts> a number that is congruent to 1 modulo 3 means that that number is one more than a multiple of 3
[12:15:24] <zacts> a number that is congruent to 2 modulo 3 means that the number is two more than a multiple of 3
[12:15:27] <zacts> is this correct?
[12:15:39] <Juliu> yes
[12:16:03] <zacts> so all numbers that are congruent to 2 modulo 3 share the same residue class
[12:16:24] <Juliu> yes
[12:17:04] <zacts> you can't have a number that is congruent to 99 modulo 3 tho, right?
[12:17:39] <Juliu> That is debatable
[12:17:56] <zacts> why is that debatable?
[12:17:56] *** Quits: diamondbond (~diamondbo@112.134.170.153) (Quit: Leaving)
[12:18:19] <zacts> oh maybe the way I phrased it
[12:18:48] <Juliu> Because you could argue that every number congruent to 2 modulo 3 is also congruent to 99 modulo 3
[12:18:50] *** Quits: node1 (~node1@user/node1) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:19:19] <Juliu> No, wait, I meant every number congruent to 0 modulo 3 of course
[12:19:53] <Juliu> 99 and 0 are in the same residue class modulo 3
[12:20:18] <zacts> ok
[12:20:22] <Juliu> So writing something like 6 = 99 (mod 3) is correct, I think
[12:21:26] <Juliu> So having a number that is congruent to 99 modulo 3 is the same as having a number that is congruent to 0 modulo 3

[12:22:14] <Juliu> And since there are only 3 different residue classes modulo 3, you normally call them 0, 1, and 2
[12:23:07] <Juliu> But 0 is just one representative from the first residue class, and 99 is an equally good representative of the same class

[13:31:08] <zacts> ok
[13:31:45] <zacts> how would I say '29 is congruent to 5 mod 6' in more compact notation? or is there no standard way to do this?
[13:32:04] <int-e> You mean even more compact than 29 ≡ 5 (mod 6)?

[13:33:17] <Fangs> zacts: 29 ~^6 5 is fine
[13:33:36] <zacts> oh wait. tongue twister. 29 ≡ 5 (mod 6) is what I mean.
[13:33:50] <zacts> or 29 ~⁶ 5 with the new notation
[13:34:55] <zacts> so 29 ~⁶ 5 and 29 ~⁶ 10 both mean the same thing.
[13:35:08] <zacts> oops
[13:35:13] <int-e> or something like ≡_6 (hmm, I'd prefer a subscript, why... oh because there's ->^n for powers of arbitrary relations ->, and I have used *that* notation a lot)

[18:20:19] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: conj is a nice continuous field automorphism on C, the only one besides identity.

[18:20:58] <int-e> ("automorphism" encompasses, in a single word, that conjugation is a bijection and commutes with the field operations... so addition, multiplication, and inverses)
[18:20:58] <[itchyjunk]> right! automorphisms preserve both the operations!
[18:21:17] <Z-module> and since it's continuous and fixes R, it also commutes with holomorphic functions whose power series coefficients are all real, such as exp
[18:21:17] <[itchyjunk]> oh i think i knew at some point that that field only had 2 auto morphism to..

[23:30:49] <Franciman> Actually I want to prove something different, who cares about that
[23:31:06] <Franciman> is (x + y) + (x^3 - y^2) an irreducible element?
[23:31:11] <Franciman> i am having some trouble proving eet

[23:32:53] <riv> what you mean + (x^3 - y^2)
[23:33:04] <Franciman> I wrote that thing because it is an element of the quotient

[23:45:23] <int-e> You can normalize the elements of C[x, y]/(x^3 - y^2) by replacing every y^2 by x^3... so elements can be written as y P(x) + Q(x)... then play around with the corresponding multiplication law.
