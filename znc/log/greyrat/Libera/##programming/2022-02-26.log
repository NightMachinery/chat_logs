[00:03:57] <Hash> In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only wood plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height.

[00:04:07] <Hash> In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight.

[01:15:35] <cockatoodude> Although some systems, really get a big boost from small overclocks, the more you overclock the less benefit you see, from my personal experience that isn't huge but maybe 30 or 40 systems I played with enough to really push the limits
[01:15:43] <cockatoodude> I don't even overclock at all anymore
[01:15:53] <epony> yep, it's no point
[01:15:55] <GeDaMo> "Choosing the right transistor is key to building 1960s style high speed discrete RTL circuits."
[01:16:00] <cockatoodude> I keep stock clocks and undervolt as much as possible without losing stability
[01:16:34] <epony> no point in undervolting, you'll start losing functional blocks at load
[01:16:35] <cockatoodude> My i3-8350k quad core single threaded CPU, REALLY got big boosts from overclocking, in terms of compile times of many things I often use and compile
[01:17:00] <epony> which can compromise your cryptographic functions or result in errors and hardware bugs
[01:17:19] <epony> undervolting is a side channel attack on processors physically
[01:17:25] <cockatoodude> I see

[01:17:50] <epony> 5% below may be fine and unnoticeable
[01:17:51] <cockatoodude> I have never really messed with the optimized defaults in firmware, when using a system for actual end user or development purposes
[01:18:04] <cockatoodude> I just play with them as an enthusiast, or used to.
[01:18:31] <epony> yes, it's little returns for a lot of tweaking and sub-optimal stability after changed electrical parameters, it's typically needed in rare cases
[01:19:19] <cockatoodude> I got tired of killing $5000 PCs, and with losing stability/data integrity. never thought about cryptographic functional integrity, and I never heard that talked about at any security conferences I watched online or attended
[01:19:58] <cockatoodude> but, since I use the firmware recommended optimized defaults for everything I use real world, it doesn't affect me

[02:21:28] <cockatoodude> What part of history interests you?
[02:22:21] <pyzozord> I'd say cultural, history of sciences, art, philosophy, how people lived, what they thought

[04:05:20] <flakland> at one point people probably said it was secure
[04:05:33] <oldlaptop> Three rounds of DES in a row *do* take millenia to brute-force, and data thus encrypted are scare-quotes "secure" for all practical purposes.
[04:05:36] <PlanckWalk> there is no unconditional "secure"
[04:05:42] <flakland> so you end up constantly pushing the "security" goal post
[04:05:49] <oldlaptop> (The DES algorithm itself is not broken, it merely became feasible to brute-force its 56-bit keys.)

[04:06:20] <audio> cockatoodude, these are mel spectrograms. time is a dimension, but anomoly detection is not necessarily what it's doing
[04:06:26] <cockatoodude> Quantum computing is getting pretty mature hardware wise, but algorithms for making useful software including breaking the majority of ciphers don't exist
[04:06:53] <oldlaptop> Advances in computing power to make even 128-bit symmetric keys vulnerable would appear to be a *long* time away. DES has 56-bit keys, and each bit represents a doubling in the difficulty of brute-forcing it.
[04:07:09] <audio> cockatoodude, "that's kind of a ML/AI question, which involves very little actual programming skill" -- i beg to differ
[04:07:29] <arahael> cockatoodude: Certainly at a consumer-grade level, indeed.
[04:07:41] <cockatoodude> 128 bit AES is broken with grovers algorithm, altough I'm not sure to what degree. The cryptographic definition of breaking a cipher means you can decrypt faster than brute force, even if by 1%
[04:08:03] <oldlaptop> as to "lol people probably used to say DES was secure", its short key length was regarded as potentially troublesome more or less from the beginning.

[05:37:04] <TonyStone> it does have other functions... i tried to loop through the string one char at a time.  but to do it you have to draw pictures... and i gave up and moved onto the regex function. lol... i will just go back and try to loop it backwars for him by drawing stupid "code"
[05:37:11] <Decker> oh oops the && does have to be split, don't want to do another loop if !n
[05:38:46] <TonyStone> He is trying to read a pipe... then he wants to parse the data from the pipe.  the problem is the pipe is buffered, so it doesnt start or end based on EOL...  labview doesnt have a built in function to read the buffer as if it were a text file...
[05:39:12] <TonyStone> it is infuriating trying to do anything with it but he HAS TO use labview... for whatever reason.  oh well lol

[07:56:59] <KillerWasp> i can't open link
[07:57:44] <austincheney> KillerWasp, i think in my case that is proving to be the opposite of what employers are looking for
[07:58:16] <austincheney> perhaps, over qualified (if thats even possible in software where credentials don't exist)
[07:59:24] <InPhase> austincheney: People usually don't turn down an applicant for being too experienced.  They might turn down an applicant if they think they can't afford an applicant's expected salary (you can try to control those perceived expections if needed), but never for being too experienced.  What you need to pay attention to is the nuances of what each position is looking for.  There are certain modalities 
[07:59:30] <InPhase> of communicating engineering information which will not fit with a particular role, for example.  It is one thing to be an impressive and skilled engineer, but some positions might also require you to be able to communicate requirements and issues in plain language with stakeholders who are not engineers.
[08:00:30] <rindolf> KillerWasp: i got "all those ideas about dns were already given to me, none of that works because the problem is the ISP that seems to have some kind of filter on it"
[08:00:34] <InPhase> austincheney: So if issues are arising like that example, then rather than think of this as requiring less experience, think of it as additional skill and experience that can be beneficial to work on.

[08:02:39] <austincheney> InPhase, it seems they are specifically looking for short declarative code and the framework flavor of the moment React/Next.js and minimal problem solving ability beyond that

[08:04:03] * KillerWasp swap the isp of rindolf with my isp
[08:04:21] <austincheney> the feedback from the prior interviews is that I would not be happy there because the job is too beginner or too boring for me
[08:04:48] <rindolf> austincheney: tell them that "there are no small jobs, only small workers": https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Emma-Watson-applying-for-a-software-dev-job/
[08:04:49] <bayaz> Type: application/xhtml+xml 
[08:04:50] <InPhase> austincheney: One thing that can be very helpful as a technique, is to try to start out interviews by asking people to tell you a little more about their perspective of the position and the needs of it.  Asking a question that shows interest and curiosity up front at the very start of an interview is of course always a great start, getting the interviewer to start talking is always a good start, and 
[08:04:56] <InPhase> then the real trick, is that you can watch for what sort of language and word choices they use while describing the position.  This will spell out for you what sorts of things you want to say and emphasize about your background and approach during the interview.
[08:06:03] <InPhase> austincheney: So then if they start talking about it in terms of short declarative code, or those particular frameworks, and you still actually want the position, then you know what things to emphasize.
[08:06:17] <austincheney> true
[08:06:36] <austincheney> maybe I am too old and should be looking at management
[08:08:18] <InPhase> You can of course also shop for positions that you think better fit your background.  A great job search is one done with very few applications filed, because you found a position that you have high confidence is a very strong fit for you.  It increases the odds that they will conclude the same thing.

[18:45:40] <vdamewood> GeDaMo: I ask because I've been wondering what kind of square pitch metric graph paper has.
[18:46:07] <vdamewood> I can't even get blank A4 here, let alone A4 graph paper.
[18:46:42] <gog> i have a notebook that's half centimeter
[18:46:46] <gog> of graph paper
[18:47:01] <vdamewood> 5mm sounds like a reasonable pitch.
[18:47:08] <gog> about 5/inch
[18:47:30] <vdamewood> Works out, an inch is 25.4mm
[18:47:51] <epony> pitch om mm paper is.. surprise.. 1 mm
[18:48:04] <epony> you're so funny ;-)

Most typed functional programming languages implement tuples directly as product types,[1] tightly associated with algebraic data types, pattern matching, and destructuring assignment.[2] Many programming languages offer an alternative to tuples, known as record types, featuring unordered elements accessed by label.[3] A few programming languages combine ordered tuple

[23:49:45] <ProfSimm> An array is not really a list first. Is it. It's a map first. This is why it has O(1) index access.
[23:50:01] <absentia> still awaiting a response...
[23:50:03] <epony> there is no "map" data structure though
[23:50:08] <absentia> epony: correct

[23:51:07] <DPA> An array is a kind of list. It has multiple items, an item can occur more than once, you can iterate over them. Same with linked lists.
[23:51:13] <ProfSimm> An array is a map, where the keys can be derived by traversing a category, thus exhausting the map's contents.
[23:51:19] <absentia> DPA: correct
[23:51:26] <flakland> it's been awfully botty in here recently
[23:51:27] <absentia> holy fuck people understand what i'm saying?!

[23:51:39] <pyzozord> i been saying the same thing too :P
[23:51:50] <ProfSimm> None of you understood the question
[23:51:58] <absentia> that seems to be the case
[23:52:03] <DPA> AN array is not a map. You can not associate an arbitrary key with a value in an array. An array has continous numeric indeces,
[23:52:05] <epony> now we just have to find out why people invent wrong names for data structures and base their entire logic models on those
[23:52:10] <ProfSimm> There's something about arrays that makes them UNLIKE other lists.
[23:52:13] <ski> arrays typically have a definite size, while lists typically don't
[23:52:15] <absentia> epony: javascript
[23:52:18] <ProfSimm> That's what I was trying to get at

[23:52:42] <ProfSimm> And my conclusion is that arrays are maps with a specific constraint on their keys
[23:52:47] <epony> absentia, I think it started in the 60ies before some weird theorem proof maniacs had access to eniacs
[23:52:49] <ski> DPA : the numeric indices are common, but not mandatory
[23:53:02] <absentia> epony: that is from a time immemorial
[23:53:07] <epony> yeah
[23:53:14] <pyzozord> ProfSimm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type#Abstract_arrays like I said, get and set

[23:53:17] <epony> lack of access to a real computer, makes you a virtual programmer
[23:53:19] <ProfSimm> So they're not lists. You can DERIVE a list from an array, but the array is not a list itself
[23:53:26] <pyzozord> ok I was done before
[23:53:33] <absentia> ProfSimm: yes
[23:53:37] <absentia> I would say implement as

[23:54:53] <absentia> what a god
[23:54:55] <epony> she worked on his bio-hardware though
[23:55:05] <DPA> An array must have numeric indeces of sorts. If it's something else, such as strings, it's an associative array or a map, which is an entirely different thing.
[23:55:08] <epony> so she tapped his potential
[23:55:11] <pyzozord> ski: and just the act of programming itself can bring new insights because it's forcing specific way of thinking through the problem
[23:55:14] <epony> and got an exponential
[23:55:20] <ski> i remember i (re)invented assembler labels, when coding on paper (i only had access to a low-level machine-code monitor, with no label support)

[23:56:06] <ski> DPA : what about indexing by an `enum' type ? what about indexing by a disjoint union (of valid index types) ?
[23:56:17] <epony> computer poetry in programming though, not much of a poetic justice

[23:56:48] <DPA> Those are just numbers with fancy labels. But at least at runtime, still numbers.
[23:57:00] <ski> sure. but conceptually, those are not numbers
[23:57:20] <epony> they are stored programs
[23:57:26] <DPA> I don't see how that matters in practice.

[23:59:31] <ski> data could be stored in many ways. common basic primitives are (a) a contiguous sequence of objects, placed after each other in memory; (b) indirections via addresses

[23:59:49] <epony> what about bits?
