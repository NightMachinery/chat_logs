[01:39:03] <Cryowolf> felt so good about myself
[01:39:58] <Bco1981> i didn't get the 3d accelerator part, i thought it was just a graphics card, so i replaced it with my old gpu. and doom2 was like 2-5 fps

[05:20:07] <Nanobot> As many of you probably know, today is April Fools Day. It is a day of tomfoolery and shenanigans. In order to celebrate, I have decided to perform an April Fools Day prank on you. Here it is: I found your missing glasses. They're in your cupboard. This concludes my prank. I will remind you that this was only meant for humor and should not be taken seriously. Thank you.
[05:22:37] <bxgelsan> Nanobot: what if i cant find my glasses because i refuse to wear them
[05:23:22] <Nanobot> The glasses you don't use are usually on the top shelf.
[05:23:43] <Nanobot> They're referred to as "china" despite having no connection to the nation of that name.

[13:22:22] <JesseDesu> especially japanese beer
[13:23:13] <JesseDesu> with gpus so powerful does it even need a cpu
[13:23:51] <Bco1981> yeah it's not your standard x86 instruction set processing unit
[13:24:07] <JesseDesu> i dont know what that means but go on

[17:05:00] <MootPoot> nani
[17:05:28] <MootPoot> wasn't there supposed to be a carbon tax increase on fuel purchases
[17:05:46] <emmeka> there was, effective yesterday... wait
[17:05:50] <emmeka> yesterday was April 1
[17:05:54] <emmeka> Trudeau, why?!
[17:06:37] <emmeka> April Fools from the federal government, haha, aren't taxes funny
[17:06:50] <amigojapan> April 1st is the start of the school year and fiscal year in Japan
[17:06:54] <emmeka> MootPoot but no give it time it will have gone up 3 cents by Monday and all that
[17:07:39] <MootPoot> think about it this way
[17:07:52] <MootPoot> Trudeau is incentivizing the ##anime lifestyles
[17:08:18] <MootPoot> so my current car uses about 9L per 100km
[17:08:25] <amigojapan> When gasoline goes up everything goes up no?
[17:08:28] <MootPoot> if I get a motorcycle, that's 3L / 100km
[17:08:31] <MootPoot> :#
[17:08:34] <MootPoot> :3
[17:08:35] <analoq> MootPoot: 3l? 
[17:08:43] <MootPoot> analoq: yes?
[17:08:44] <analoq> motorcycles are kinda thirsty
[17:09:00] <MootPoot> yeah, well, most of them are more tuned towards performance
[17:09:03] <MootPoot> rather then economy
[17:09:15] <analoq> i guess yeah. but even scooters drink quite a lot
[17:09:36] <analoq> apparently the 50cc scooters already need 2-4l
[17:09:41] <MootPoot> less then a car - that 3L figure was for a 0.5L motorcycle
[17:09:46] <Bco1981> analoq: depends on how you drive
[17:09:51] <MootPoot> that's like 1/3 the use 
[17:09:53] <MootPoot> of my car
[17:10:02] <MootPoot> and 99% its just one person anyways
[17:10:07] <analoq> Bco1981: let's be honest there's only one way to drive a 50cc scooter. full throttle
[17:10:11] <MootPoot> ^^^
[17:10:13] <Bco1981> lol
[17:10:19] <MootPoot> slow shit fast is more fun then fast shit slow
[17:10:22] <analoq> otherwise you might as well take the bicycle
[17:10:56] <Bco1981> is a scooter allowed on a highway/freeway
[17:10:58] <Bco1981> ?
[17:11:12] <Bco1981> it's not here.
[17:11:15] <analoq> well they are limited to 45km/h here effectively so in Germany it would be a no
[17:11:50] <emmeka> amigojapan yeah it's generally not the best considering we already have record inflation
[17:12:16] <amigojapan> Ouch emmeka 
[17:12:17] <MootPoot> I actually ended up downscaling my computers
[17:12:23] <emmeka> this will make it worse, but also, the government made this commitment a long time ago and now they have parliament's confidence to do it, so
[17:12:34] <MootPoot> partially since most of them were just idling
[17:12:43] <MootPoot> amigojapan: time for the ARM revolution
[17:12:58] <MootPoot> hurry up qualcomm, get your ass in gear
[17:13:00] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I am already there
[17:13:01] <MootPoot> make something
[17:13:08] <emmeka> and to be absolutely fair, it is being called a "carbon tax" but it is, in actuality, designed to be revenue neutral for the median individual.
[17:13:09] <Bco1981> time for the arm wrestle to begin
[17:13:44] <MootPoot> I use lower natrual gas and octane then the normal person but my electric use is up there
[17:13:48] <MootPoot> about 2x the norm
[17:14:24] <emmeka> I run premium. it is a little painful.
[17:14:32] <emmeka> but the car needs it, she is turbo
[17:14:34] <amigojapan> emmeka: the median individual still needs to eat food carried to them somehow
[17:14:57] * Sadale licks emmeka :3
[17:15:37] <analoq> luckily the median moves upwards if the lower end dies of, so no problem there :3
[17:15:50] <emmeka> amigojapan basically the tax is refunded as an annual credit distributed equally among all taxpayers. The result of this is that people who use very little carbon, pay less than they get back, whereas those who have above average carbon footprints will in general pay more than they get back.
[17:16:00] <analoq> just gotta make sure you stay above the median :D
[17:16:17] <MootPoot> emmeka: now if only they could subsidize some solar with that
[17:16:19] <MootPoot> :3
[17:16:28] <emmeka> at least this is how it is going to work in theory. I have a hard time believing the government will let such a juicy revenue stream remain neutral forever.
[17:16:30] <MootPoot> Ab will never do that though - not with the current govt
[17:16:38] <amigojapan> I see emmeka 
[17:16:44] <MootPoot> I would get a electric motorcycle
[17:16:48] <MootPoot> except
[17:16:58] <MootPoot> the market is a joke
[17:17:08] <emmeka> good luck buying vehicles these days
[17:17:08] <Sapphirus> Electric is a joke if you live in Alberta
[17:17:12] <analoq> emmeka: what does premium mean? 95? 98?
[17:17:17] <Sapphirus> Why? Coal power :P

[17:17:43] <Sapphirus> cleaner to burn gas in a combustion engine than drive an electric vehicle with a dirty grid
[17:17:47] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: afaik the math still works out in electric's favour - power stations tend to extract more useful power then your average car
[17:17:51] <emmeka> analoq 95 and 98? damn, where you getting that good shit.
[17:17:53] <MootPoot> even with grid losses
[17:17:57] <MootPoot> emmeka: you dont get that?
[17:18:07] <MootPoot> we get 92, 95 and 98
[17:18:17] <MootPoot> might be 96 idk
[17:18:22] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, they **might**, but you have to build more capacity if you were going to convert everyone over.
[17:18:24] <analoq> emmeka: hm iirc there are different systems used in the us/eu to measure octane
[17:18:57] <analoq> here its 95/98/102 (proprietary stuff e.g. shell v power)
[17:18:57] <Sapphirus> And, if your grid isn't clean, well, you're just shifting the Co2 production from tail pipes to smoke stacks.
[17:19:02] <MootPoot> we also have 87 and 89
[17:19:23] <emmeka> premium here is usually 91 or 93
[17:19:32] <analoq> yeah 97 in britain is equal to 91 us
[17:19:39] <emmeka> oh, I see.
[17:19:52] <MootPoot> now that I think about it
[17:20:09] <MootPoot> I think the only places I've seen 98 are racetracks or next to them
[17:20:20] <MootPoot> 92 is the normal prem
[17:20:35] <emmeka> I can't say I've ever seen 92 so I think you're mistaken

[17:20:47] <analoq> yeah that sounds in line with eu then. 98 is what we call 'super plus' here
[17:21:02] <JesseDesu> my farts smell somewhere between 87 gas and indian food
[17:21:09] <analoq> which should roughly map to your 92
[17:22:12] <emmeka> I just want hydrogen infrastructure to exist so we don't have to get cars with $30,000 battery replacements multiple times in their lifetime
[17:22:21] <MootPoot> ha
[17:22:25] <MootPoot> hydrogen is a dead end
[17:22:29] <emmeka> not really.
[17:22:31] <MootPoot> that low energy density
[17:22:36] <MootPoot> and cost to get it
[17:22:37] <emmeka> it has high energy density.
[17:22:38] <MootPoot> nah
[17:22:47] <analoq> the energy density is high...
[17:22:51] <JesseDesu> dont you need batteries with russian minerals

[17:23:01] <MootPoot> and compressing it is a pain
[17:23:05] <emmeka> MootPoot hydrogen has 3 times the energy density as gasoline.
[17:23:09] <analoq> the issue is the cost/joule is high as well
[17:23:15] <MootPoot> in solid form?

[17:23:36] <MootPoot> oh, that's per KG
[17:23:47] <Sapphirus> emmeka, hydrogen would probably be better for 18-wheelers
[17:23:53] <MootPoot> yeah getting it down to that pressure is the killer
[17:24:12] <analoq> does hydrogen even liquify under pressure at normal temps?
[17:24:12] <JesseDesu> liquid hydrogen is good for saturn v rockets
[17:24:16] <emmeka> Sapphirus yeah. battery bank trucks are impractical due to batteries increasing in size exponentially as vehicle weight increases
[17:24:22] <JesseDesu> the last time they made one was 1972
[17:24:25] <emmeka> analoq yeah.
[17:24:44] <MootPoot> I guess we could make them lighter....and smaller
[17:24:52] <emmeka> not exceptionally ridiculous pressures, like 500 bar.
[17:25:04] <JesseDesu> how far can an ant travel without food
[17:25:18] <Sapphirus> Even in pickup trucks, I think, that is applicable.
[17:25:24] <JesseDesu> or how long can a gnat fly without replenishing
[17:25:28] <MootPoot> tbh the only realistic way I see this happening is with a combo of fast battery swaps + home charging
[17:25:37] <Sapphirus> Lithium-ion batteries don't scale well.
[17:25:41] <MootPoot> taiwan has a entire fleet of electric scooters that you just go to a station and swap
[17:25:48] <MootPoot> they are literally everywhere
[17:25:52] <MootPoot> just pay for the swap
[17:25:54] <MootPoot> and go
[17:26:17] <Sapphirus> Hydrogen is probably better than having to deal with the waste that batteries produce
[17:26:26] <emmeka> Sapphirus right. it's really the way to go. yes hydrogen has less efficiency than a battery, but hydrogen has actually reasonable energy density unlike batteries, it is quick to fuel, and existing hydrogen fuel cells have lifespans in the 500,000 mile range.
[17:26:37] <analoq> i still think we need a mix. there is no 'one' solution
[17:26:44] <JesseDesu> everything scales well.  all you need is photoshop
[17:26:49] <emmeka> we could probably improve that, we're really only on first gen hydrogen vehicles
[17:26:50] <analoq> replacing all ice cars with electric cars is just stupid imho
[17:27:05] <MootPoot> or, here is another solution - for now we let all that tech do its thing
[17:27:14] <MootPoot> and we tax the shit out of larger vehicles
[17:27:18] <MootPoot> smol cars only
[17:27:18] <JesseDesu> ice/atf/fbi
[17:27:23] <emmeka> MootPoot except we can't, because nobody is building hydrogen infrastructure.
[17:27:30] <emmeka> that's it, that's the reason there's not many of them
[17:27:40] <emmeka> except in Tokyo...
[17:27:41] <MootPoot> ?
[17:27:44] <Sapphirus> I think it's a disgrace it hasn't caught on.
[17:28:03] <MootPoot> I meant like just wait for the other tech to figure itself out - no matter if it is hydrogen or something else
[17:28:06] <Sapphirus> Lithium-ion batteries produce so much waste at EoL
[17:28:08] <JesseDesu> i want a maintenance free house boat
[17:28:09] <emmeka> Toyota makes a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle and there is *some* hydrogen fueling stations in Tokyo, so it has sold reasonably well there.
[17:28:14] <emmeka> the Toyota Mirai
[17:28:16] <MootPoot> and in the meantime we massively push downwards on vehicle size
[17:28:29] <analoq> audi q7 size?
[17:28:30] <MootPoot> scooter lufe
[17:28:36] <MootPoot> lyfe*
[17:28:41] <Sapphirus> I don't think that's a practical solution. Only a city dweller would think that's a smart idea.
[17:29:12] <MootPoot> europe does it just fine - the farm folk can have their stuff
[17:29:25] <MootPoot> every kid with a f150 is a bit much
[17:29:27] <JesseDesu> the ford fusion is a lie.  its not powered by fusion at all
[17:29:33] <MootPoot> city tax on fuel
[17:29:33] <emmeka> Sapphirus like just think of the change it would make if *one* of the major gas station chains (Esso, Shell, whatever) was like "we're going to put 1 H2 pump at every station we own"
[17:29:45] <analoq> MootPoot: we have a few rolling around in my town. it's just sureal. they are so large :D
[17:29:52] <Sapphirus> emmeka, it would change the entire game.
[17:30:06] <MootPoot> analoq: now imagine if your city was filled with them and 85% of them never get used to capacity
[17:30:09] <Sapphirus> We need more automakers to start investing in hydrogen cell technology, though, for that to happen.
[17:30:16] <JesseDesu> i want a maintenance free body
[17:30:23] <MootPoot> toyota killed off its hydrogen project no?
[17:30:27] <analoq> MootPoot: well it wouldn't be much of a problem, there's enough space here
[17:30:29] <MootPoot> they made some stations in the UK
[17:30:39] <MootPoot> analoq: well, not space wise - fuel use wise
[17:30:45] <emmeka> because suddenly you'd have people who could go electric but still run their car the way they're used to with gas vehicles, fueling up at stations and without charging infrastructure or the inability to do long road trips most places.
[17:30:52] <MootPoot> most cars are not even remotely used to capacity
[17:30:54] <emmeka> MootPoot no, they still make them.
[17:31:10] <emmeka> you can even buy them here.
[17:31:18] <Sapphirus> emmeka, that makes the most sense, honestly. Our power grid can't handle a transition to electric in its present form.
[17:31:32] <MootPoot> my block of houses almost entirely has some kind of pickup and only maybe 2 people ever use the bed
[17:31:36] <analoq> MootPoot: well 1l is around 2EUR or 7.6EUR/gal
[17:31:42] <analoq> hf driving around :D
[17:31:42] <Sapphirus> We can probably do it to a limited extent, but I don't believe our power grid has enough capacity to even do it.
[17:31:44] <MootPoot> for the rest its just "I need a f150 so I can drop my kids off to the school 5min away"
[17:31:59] <MootPoot> analoq: ?
[17:32:14] <MootPoot> I already drive a much smaller vehicle
[17:32:14] <JesseDesu> there used to be a hydraulic powered car but the oil companies bought the plans for it and made sure it never saw the light

[17:35:17] <emmeka> but really it goes like this: GM/Chevy, know how to make a great transmission. Dodge, knows how to make a great engine. And Ford... Ford knows how to make vehicles cheaper.

[17:57:01] <Fenderbassist> yeah but when you see what they are faced with, you'll probably have more pity than anything else for them
[17:57:05] <analoq> they are all just greedy self centered shitheads
[17:57:07] <Fenderbassist> if current trends continue
[17:57:11] <Fenderbassist> analoq: name them
[17:57:12] <MootPoot> h-ha
[17:57:16] <MootPoot> y-eah
[17:57:17] <MootPoot> about that
[17:57:24] <MootPoot> my situation you say
[17:57:40] <analoq> Fenderbassist: name who?
[17:57:43] <emmeka> Fenderbassist it's less pity and more "sorry, kid, my generation faced insurmountable bullshit and basically failed to do anything to stop it. Good luck out there, it's your turn now."
[17:57:49] <Fenderbassist> analoq: the ones you are condemning :)
[17:57:50] <MootPoot> I've written off on ever buying a house or being able to fiscally afford a life here
[17:57:57] <MootPoot> I'm gonna hang out for the next 5 years or so
[17:57:59] <Fenderbassist> emmeka: that's fair
[17:58:01] <MootPoot> then fucking bail
[17:58:06] <MootPoot> join Sadale in PH
[17:58:13] <Sadale> :O
[17:58:23] <Fenderbassist> analoq: it's half a joke, half a "that's a lot of people to be labeling in one shot"
[17:58:25] <analoq> Fenderbassist: people who blame certain problems to certain generations
[17:58:29] <emmeka> MootPoot why not go somewhere more affordable?
[17:58:33] <MootPoot> average home price is now 813k emmeka according to a recent CBC article
[17:58:38] <emmeka> like uhh... *shudders* Saskatoon???
[17:58:39] <MootPoot> emmeka: where?!?
[17:58:47] <Fenderbassist> analoq: I understand
[17:58:47] <Sadale> MootPoot, If you're just burning money in Canada you may as well burn that money in PH instead. Your money would be far more long-lasting :P
[17:58:52] <Sadale> You get more with the same price
[17:59:18] <emmeka> MootPoot or I mean my neck of the woods is affordable
[17:59:21] <MootPoot> even sask is like 330k
[17:59:21] <emmeka> or out east
[17:59:26] <MootPoot> I can't afford 330k
[17:59:41] <emmeka> surely that's detached home prices and not like, 1 bedroom condo
[17:59:44] <MootPoot> Sadale: that's my plan, get work experience here and bail
[17:59:58] <Sadale> MootPoot, Get work experience in where?
[18:00:01] <MootPoot> emmeka: if I was going to settle with a 1 bedroom place I would just live with my family forever
[18:00:02] <MootPoot> tbh
[18:00:07] <Sapphirus> emmeka, the funny part is it's only affordable where nobody wants to live and there's no jobs.
[18:00:08] <MootPoot> Sadale: programming - here
[18:00:12] <Sadale> MootPoot, in Canada or PH?
[18:00:22] <emmeka> Sapphirus that's my kind of place, fortunately.
[18:00:23] <MootPoot> build a repo here then work remote in PH
[18:00:32] <Sadale> oh
[18:00:45] <emmeka> Sapphirus it's kind of crazy the population redistribution we're seeing
[18:00:45] <Sadale> MootPoot is davic #2
[18:01:02] <MootPoot> the prices things are and the trends
[18:01:16] <Zoidberg> except he isn't into korean stuff Sadale 
[18:01:21] <Sadale> true
[18:01:24] <Zoidberg> and also no gf
[18:01:28] <emmeka> like NB/NS, which have suffered population emmigration for decades, are currently at record population growth. Hundreds of thousands have left the major urban areas of Ontario, either heading east in search of affordable housing, or moving to smaller cities.
[18:01:32] <MootPoot> unless I strike gold - I am almost certain I'm gonna bail within the next 5-7 years
[18:01:33] <emmeka> I even see it here.
[18:01:38] <Sadale> Zoidberg, and MootPoot is a semi-virgin :3
[18:01:42] <Sadale> davic probably isn't
[18:01:47] <emmeka> you know how many people I've met recently which are like "yeah we just moved here from Toronto"
[18:01:52] * Sadale is a full-ledge virgin :3
[18:02:13] <Sapphirus> emmeka, It's going to be interesting to see what happens when the interest rates go up
[18:02:19] <emmeka> couple up the road... the new dentist at the dentist's office... my friend's new neighbours... the guy who alwas wants to talk to me at work
[18:02:24] <emmeka> Sapphirus well they have gone up now
[18:02:31] <Sapphirus> Toronto is going to turn into a ghost town full of abandoned investment real estate falling apart
[18:02:31] <emmeka> just not a murderous amount
[18:02:34] <Sadale> MootPoot, Next time over if whatever company I'm working for is hiring and requires stack that you've got, I'll make referral for you.
[18:02:43] <emmeka> my mortgage rate is still well below inflation 
[18:02:58] <MootPoot> Sadale: sweet
[18:03:00] <Sapphirus> emmeka, indication is that it's going up to 2.5 by next year
[18:03:07] <emmeka> I think they went up at the beginning of last month, half a percent or something
[18:03:22] <Sapphirus> That's the BoC's target according to analysts
[18:03:22] <emmeka> ooooh, scary, 2.5%... that's... half of inflation!!
[18:03:26] <emmeka> how ever will we survive
[18:03:32] <emmeka> idk what they're thinking, really
[18:03:37] <Sadale> MootPoot, so you're gonna get into gradschool or you'd just stay being NEET?
[18:03:40] <MootPoot> canada was supposed to be the ecologically inhospitable place, not financially
[18:03:44] <MootPoot> Sadale: oh about that
[18:03:50] <MootPoot> I got into grad school
[18:03:55] <Sadale> oh cool
[18:04:00] <MootPoot> gonna do that and then 
[18:04:01] <Sadale> MootPoot, you'll get paid for that right?
[18:04:10] <MootPoot> no I have to pay the school
[18:04:11] <MootPoot> lol
[18:04:22] <Sadale> aw. Not the research kind
[18:04:29] <MootPoot> its not a PhD
[18:04:30] <MootPoot> just a masters
[18:04:37] <MootPoot> afaik masters dont do research like that
[18:04:50] <Sadale> Here there're two kind of masters. One is the research kind. And the other one is the study kind. The research one here would pay you.
[18:05:15] <Sadale> Technically you need to pay for the tuition fee. But you'll make the money that's a bit higher than the tuition fee so you'll ended up earning a profit.
[18:05:36] <Sadale> Not as profitable as working in corporate world tho.
[18:05:36] <emmeka> Sapphirus right now we have the weird situation that housing supply continues to shrink faster than demand
[18:05:56] <emmeka> people aren't selling their houses, people aren't building houses
[18:06:17] <MootPoot> I'm not that hung up on the houses part either - its mostly the QoL part
[18:06:28] <MootPoot> CoL*
[18:06:35] <Sapphirus> emmeka, which is simultaneously putting pressure on inflation
[18:07:00] <Sapphirus> There's no way out of this that doesn't involve a 'market reset' or 'crash'.
[18:07:02] <MootPoot> my formerly 400$ grocery bill for two peeps is now 600
[18:07:06] <emmeka> why not think more about a condo? I mean if you want urban life, you don't go outside, you don't have kids or any even remotely near-ish plans for them.
[18:07:31] <Fenderbassist> less maintenance concerns too
[18:07:36] <Fenderbassist> you pay for them to deal with it all
[18:07:47] <Fenderbassist> in some cases
[18:08:01] <Sapphirus> Condos are great if they're built well.
[18:08:05] <Fenderbassist> yes
[18:08:08] <Sapphirus> And you can't hear your neighours having a screaming fit
[18:08:17] <emmeka> like ofc you can't afford a single family home you're a young 20 something man at the beginning of his career, freshly graduated, single.
[18:08:33] <MootPoot> emmeka: with the rates of increase I dont see myself owning one here ever
[18:08:42] <MootPoot> I dont mind if I cant get it within the next 10 years
[18:08:55] <MootPoot> my salary isen't going up the way houses are
[18:09:08] <Sapphirus> Most peoples aren't.
[18:09:17] <Sapphirus> Path to home ownership for a lot of our generation, MootPoot, will be inheritance.
[18:09:21] <MootPoot> and the way the market works - it goes up like a rocket but down like a feather ( if it ever does )
[18:09:23] <emmeka> right. I'm not suggesting that the market isn't fucked or that you should go buy one right now because I think you're able to.
[18:09:26] <Sapphirus> And others, will just be fucked.
[18:10:11] <emmeka> I'm just saying you should re-think your goals if you're like "I can't afford a single family detached home in an expensive city alone on one salary by myself, might as well go overseas". Like why do you even need, or want, that?
[18:10:31] <Sapphirus> There's a lot of people who believe the mentality of "just eat ramen noodles and save money." That really doesn't work unless you live somewhere in true rural bumfuck if you have a well-paying occupation.
[18:10:48] <emmeka> true rural bumfuck is my aesthetic
[18:10:49] <Fenderbassist> also horrible for your health
[18:11:09] <emmeka> I'll be pretty satisfied if this results in the de-urbanization of millenials, tbh
[18:11:10] <Fenderbassist> you'd be better off buying cheap carrots and peanut butter than ramen
[18:11:17] <emmeka> there's many dead and dying towns that could use them
[18:11:25] <Sapphirus> emmeka, I'm sure it will. 
[18:11:43] <Sapphirus> So as long as those towns are willing to build internet infrastructure to meet the demands of these folks.
[18:12:01] <Sapphirus> Toronto is going to look worse than Detroit if a mass migration occurs like that from WFH
[18:12:34] <Sapphirus> And/or it'll be a haven for Chinese money.
[18:12:51] <MootPoot> emmeka: well, the goal is to build value or assets as I get older- the way to do that seems to be owning property. If I can't realistically be able to afford the price of entry to the ability of building assets...why play the game?
[18:13:08] <Sapphirus> There are other assets you can purchase that don't involve home ownership
[18:13:14] <emmeka> sure just, single family detached homes are not the only property
[18:13:14] <MootPoot> like what
[18:13:17] <emmeka> a condo counts too
[18:13:28] <Sapphirus> Investments into stocks also count.
[18:13:38] <Sapphirus> or crypto if you're a cryptocuck
[18:13:52] <MootPoot> with how prices are going I'm not sure if the "just get a condo" advice will last either
[18:14:01] <MootPoot> by the time I'm ready to get
[18:14:02] <emmeka> MootPoot well, if I ever see any coding jobs out here in bumfuck land (oddly enough, I do seem them, not long ago the ONR wanted some) I'll let you know
[18:14:12] <emmeka> you're used to weather as cold as it gets here anyway
[18:14:28] <MootPoot> emmeka: a company offered me a job - move to vancouver for 3k a month
[18:14:34] <MootPoot> what, they want me to be homeless
[18:14:36] <MootPoot> or soemthing
[18:14:37] <emmeka> lol.
[18:14:47] <Sapphirus> they must be out of their mind
[18:14:56] <MootPoot> with extra relocation pay of 2k a month for like 3 months
[18:15:06] <MootPoot> so after 3 months I have to make do on 3k a month in vancouver
[18:15:08] <MootPoot> yeahh
[18:15:13] <emmeka> does $3k even make rent in Van
[18:15:30] <MootPoot> >does $3k even make rent in Van
[18:15:31] <bxgelsan> emmeka: blame Aurora_v_kosmose

[18:15:54] <MootPoot> get arrested and my van impounded
[18:15:55] <Sapphirus> Vancouver is a shit place anyways
[18:15:58] <Fenderbassist> morning bxgelsan 
[18:16:12] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: it was a indian multinational called HCL
[18:16:44] <MootPoot> they are shit from the ground up - their recruiters have no idea what they are going on about
[18:16:46] <Sapphirus> I'd rather stay in semi-rural bumfuck Ontario than move to some metropolitan shithole full of Chinese investment property, which sits empty with a bunch of miserable people barely earning their keep.
[18:16:49] <emmeka> MootPoot the place I live will be more liveable soon, because they're restarting our rail service
[18:17:01] <emmeka> also, the nearest town to me has surprisingly good transit
[18:17:13] <Sapphirus> I don't want to go quite as rural bumfuck as emmeka, as being in close proximity to a city is convenient.
[18:17:22] <emmeka> it helps that the entire town is a north-south line around a lakeshore
[18:17:56] <MootPoot> my only complaints about living in bumfuck nowhere is shit internet and also I might get shot on sight by the rednecks
[18:18:04] <emmeka> they do have actual fibre in town now
[18:18:08] <Sapphirus> Although it might be more affordable in the future to live in real rural bumfuck
[18:18:08] <MootPoot> WOAH
[18:18:24] <emmeka> MootPoot the nearest city to me, 20km away where I work, is 10,000 people
[18:18:29] <MootPoot> emmeka: also I dont think any other rural bumfuck women would be interested in me
[18:18:31] <Sapphirus> Proxy towns around major cities are becoming as expensive as the actual cities.
[18:18:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> bxgelsan: Blaming me for what? UwU?
[18:18:41] * MootPoot is still trying to get waifu
[18:18:44] <emmeka> it's big enough that it's got basically all the things, but small enough to feel like a small town.
[18:18:49] <emmeka> I like it.
[18:18:55] <MootPoot> I've lived in a town of about 10k or so
[18:19:05] <MootPoot> its allright - everything closes too early but
[18:19:08] <MootPoot> I can deal with that
[18:19:17] <Sapphirus> Smallest place I lived in had like 2-3k
[18:19:30] <Sapphirus> but it was in driving distance to a large metro, so
[18:19:34] <bxgelsan> Aurora_v_kosmose: that damn audio clip
[18:19:37] <emmeka> MootPoot ehhhhh I think you could manage to meet girls here. Or idk, other nerds. There's some around.
[18:19:50] <bxgelsan> o.o
[18:19:51] <Sapphirus> You can only find nerds on the internet.
[18:19:54] <emmeka> there's a game shop in town which has Magic and Warhammer tournaments, and a good manga selection.
[18:19:55] <MootPoot> I know more girls on discord then I know IRL
[18:19:59] <emmeka> there's nerds there.
[18:20:00] <MootPoot> catch is all of them are married
[18:20:05] <MootPoot> but think I am good company
[18:20:07] <MootPoot> so they keep me around
[18:20:13] <MootPoot> -_-
[18:20:52] <Sapphirus> emmeka, in my experience, it's nigh impossible to find people local to you who share your interests and actually have compatible personalities.
[18:20:59] <Sapphirus> Online -- not really.

[18:50:24] <amigojapan> Yes
[18:50:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Has the benefit you don't need to clear the litterbox either.
[18:50:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Downside is that during pandemics it's an enclosed space with other people in it.
[18:51:27] <Sapphirus> Given my cat sleeps with me in bed all night, I can't complain about spending 20 minutes a day scooping litter
[18:51:35] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: same thing with the conversation cafe
[18:51:35] <Sapphirus> He's a wonderful companion.
[18:51:50] <Sapphirus> He'll cuddle me if I go no my bed and I'm not feeling well.
[18:52:44] <Sapphirus> There's nothing more cozy than having a cat cuddle you all night in bed.
[18:53:57] <vegii> a catgirl
[18:54:34] <analoq> i wonder if thats going to be a thing one day
[18:54:38] <Sxem> you might accidentally roll over on top of the cat and kill it in yr sleep
[18:54:51] <vegii> no
[18:54:52] <analoq> i mean people put frickn holes in their ears
[18:54:59] <analoq> why not cat ears :D
[18:55:19] <Sapphirus> Sxem, do you think a 15 pound cat is going to be crushed by a 130 pound human?
[18:55:21] <Sapphirus> lol
[18:55:26] <analoq> the issue i guess is cat ears dont really work irl
[18:55:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sxem: Cats aren't that fragile, and they'll just move out of the way.
[18:55:35] <analoq> i mean what do you do with your actual ears :P
[18:55:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Have you ever seen one squeeze through a fence?
[18:55:49] <Sapphirus> He slept at my head as a kitten
[18:55:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They can exist in tight spaces quite well.
[18:56:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Basically, cats are semi-liquids
[18:56:37] <vegii> analoq: and you won't roll over it for the same reason humans don't kill their babies this way
[18:56:43] <Sapphirus> ^^^
[18:57:03] <Sapphirus> He's been sleeping in bed with me since he was a small-wee kitten at 3-4 months.

[19:07:44] <amigojapan> I see

[19:28:41] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: they are ink on paper producing impressions and affects
[19:29:53] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: imagination is possible. But it does not mean what we imagine will come true for real. Like the monsters in you sea monsters movie

[20:54:57] <Sadale> MootPoot, ?
[20:55:55] <MootPoot> Video
[20:55:58] <MootPoot> Watch
[20:56:13] <Nanobot> I was watching some Japanese clipping channels for Hololive (because I'm always curious how Japanese fans are reacting to the EN/ID stuff). There's a video where Mumei is just casually talking about how Subway's meat is gross. The comments are full of people acting like this is a scandal. Like, not joking around, but actually concerned that Mumei's going to get in trouble for this. Mixed with other comments saying that this kind of talk isn't considered a 
[20:56:13] <Nanobot> problem outside of Japan.
[20:57:50] <Zoidberg> back in youtube, anime reviews were just starting
[20:58:01] <Zoidberg> and Mr. Anime was popular back then
[20:58:13] <Zoidberg> klaxa: do you know Mr. Anime?
[20:58:16] <ezekielnoob> i was listening to taylor swift back then
[20:58:20] <ezekielnoob> but she has very good songs
[20:58:34] <klaxa> no
[20:58:48] <klaxa> i'm not much into anime reviews
[20:59:01] <klaxa> i just watch stuff and have my friends tell me i have shit taste
[20:59:08] <Nanobot> The title of the clip translates to "Mumei makes outrageous statements spontaneously while Calliope is away". For saying Subway's meat is gross? Like... is it really a problem to say something like that in Japan?
[20:59:29] <Zoidberg> klaxa: He's an anime reviewer/youtuber who killed his family
[21:00:00] <klaxa> okay, is there a relation between anime and him killing his family?
[21:00:21] <Zoidberg> no
[21:00:32] <Zoidberg> he's just fucked up kid
[21:00:52] <klaxa> i see, well i'll read some articles, but that'll probably be as deep as i go into this rabbit hole :P
