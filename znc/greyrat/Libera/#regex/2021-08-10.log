[00:56:53] <re101-deer-90> Anyone by chance know how to make a password validator regex with Java 8 that doesn't use lookahead or lookbehinds? (at least 1 of the following: lowercase, uppercase, number, special character) 8 char long
[00:57:11] <re101-deer-90> I'm almost to the point where I don't think it's possible
[01:03:50] <OnlineCop> Why do you have a restriction on using lookaheads?
[01:04:08] <JohnDoe2> it's definitely possible but verbose to keep within the 8 character length - meaning you would have alternates of each possible combination for the order in which the requirements pop up :D 
[01:04:55] <karhunkynsi> Or a bunch of patterns.
[01:05:35] <OnlineCop> A Javascript-style way to do it would be to chain the regex requirements: `if (text.match('/[a-z]/').match('/[0-9]/').match(...)`
[01:05:58] <OnlineCop> Then the order wouldn't matter (like lookaheads).
[01:06:35] <re101-deer-90> The problem is how expensive lookaheads are
[01:06:41] <OnlineCop> And if any of the requirements changed, it would be as simple as updating a single point.
[01:06:55] <OnlineCop> Lookaheads would be expensive if you use `.*?`, possibly.
[01:07:19] <OnlineCop> If you use character groups, like `(?=[^a-z]*[a-z])`, then it takes, maybe, 2 steps total.
[01:07:35] <NiLon> how often you actually plan to "validate" a password
[01:07:40] <NiLon> once a month?
[01:07:45] <re101-deer-90> I'm not 100% sure. the TL;DR is that I can't make any code changes, but have to make this regex without any lookaheads/behinds
[01:07:50] <OnlineCop> 30k cycles per second?
[01:08:09] <re101-deer-90> Our product scans files every time they're updated to match various regex's
[01:08:21] <OnlineCop> In that case, you would probably need to split it into individual regex matches, one per requirement.
[01:08:38] <NiLon> how is file scanning related to password check
[01:08:55] <OnlineCop> One to validate all-lowercase, then if that matches, the next one to validate something else, and so on.
[01:09:08] <re101-deer-90> One of our customers wants to scan his environment (company wide) for anyone that is writing passwords in plaintext
[01:09:38] <NiLon> so you are writing regex to identify passwords from text?
[01:09:39] <re101-deer-90> We're aware it will have false positives, but it's what they want. 
[01:09:41] <OnlineCop> You realize that your own IRC nick, `re101-deer-90` contains lowercase, 0-9, special character, etc. :D
[01:10:19] <re101-deer-90> rofl, I didn't even realize. It only scans saved files such as like TXT or DOCX
[01:10:25] <OnlineCop> Also: is '8' a fixed password length?
[01:10:39] <re101-deer-90> 8-20, I probably should have been more specific
[01:10:51] <OnlineCop> Yeah; that would become exponentially expensive to write manually.
[01:11:05] <NiLon> this sounds like a guest King Arthur would make
[01:11:12] <NiLon> quest even
[01:11:38] <NiLon> no clear goal nor way to complete it, yet massive waste of time
[01:11:42] <OnlineCop> I mean, if you wanted to push back and say that you're GOING to use a regex, then we could at least help you optimize it to take as few steps as possible, even with 20-character inputs.
[01:11:45] <re101-deer-90> Man... You're telling me. I've spent the last several hours trying to figure this stupid request out
[01:12:32] <OnlineCop> Is it a coding challenge or something?
[01:12:41] <re101-deer-90> So, what if we could just minimize the lookahead/behinds to only say 1 instead of all the examples I find that have like 4+ 
[01:13:12] <re101-deer-90> No, it's a specific request from a customer who is "Trying to scan for cleartext passwords on my domain"
[01:13:14] <NiLon> maybe you should re-think the approach
[01:13:23] <OnlineCop> Each look-ahead simulates its own separate .match() process. For each "lowercase", "uppercase", etc. you would need 1 process.
[01:13:35] <NiLon> like if we assume it needs to have special character, then only first look for words that have special character in them
[01:13:48] <NiLon> and only after that, check if it has the other conditions also
[01:14:08] <re101-deer-90> for the record, this was the suggested regex from him before we warned him of the performance issues `(?:\s|^)(?=.*[A-Za-z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*#?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*#?&]{8,20}(?:\s|$)`
[01:14:46] <NiLon> as in first check the most rare thing, so your code can quickly skip the invalid ones
[01:16:08] <NiLon> the performance hit comes when you check every word carefully, that is 99% wasted time
[01:16:12] <OnlineCop> Since Java supports Unicode, do you expect passwords to always contain A-Z? `\p{Lu}` (uppercase letter in ANY language) would be valid, yet not match...
[01:16:35] <OnlineCop> One major problem with that lookahead is the `.*` inside it.
[01:16:53] <OnlineCop> `(?=.*\d)` should be: `(?=\D*\d)`.
[01:17:41] <re101-deer-90> We can assume the passwords will always be `[A-Za-Z0-9]` and then the special characters like `[!@#$%^]`
[01:17:45] <OnlineCop> So also see that comma and dot aren't considered "special character".
[01:18:36] <OnlineCop> Great! So if I just write my clear-text password using ÃŸ, I'll be golden!
[01:19:09] <re101-deer-90> Haha, the damn eszett
[01:19:38] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/dMPNRa/1
[01:20:08] <NiLon> I use email addresses that most email checks don't consider valid and that seems to confuse spam bots greatly

[01:25:22] <re101-deer-90> I'm not super familiar with lookaheads/behinds, but it looks like you're using anti-patterns to immediately eliminate what isn't needed vs scanning everything like it was before?
[01:26:19] <OnlineCop> Well, they're not called anti-patterns, but yes on what it's doing.
[01:26:53] <re101-deer-90> they aren't? What is their name?
[01:27:30] <OnlineCop> Basically if you have your rule for some kind of range that would go inside a character group, like "A-Za-z", then you would do a negated character class with those values, 0 or more times, followed by a (not negated) character class with those same values.

[01:31:34] <re101-deer-90> I'm having a hard time understanding why you're saying "Match any non character unlimited times, then match a character"
[01:31:43] <re101-deer-90> or am I misunderstanding what that is doing
[01:32:23] *** re101-deer-90 is now known as reindeer-90
[01:32:34] <OnlineCop> `[^@$!%*\#?&]*` matches any non-special character 0 or more times, and then once that stops (because it hit the end of the file OR it encountered one of those characters), search for `[@$!%*\#?&]`.
[01:33:13] <OnlineCop> If it finds `[@$!%*\#?&]` then that lookahead succeeds, and it can continue matching other stuff. If it fails, because you're at the end of the string, then you report a failure.
[01:34:38] <OnlineCop> Each time a lookahead succeeds, its position in the string resets to the same point that it had started. So it will scan forward 3 times, one per lookahead group, and restart the scan at the same place for the next lookahead (or once they're all finished, for the next match).
[01:35:41] <OnlineCop> One change you might need to make is to include `\s` within the negated group.
[01:36:27] <OnlineCop> The typical "password" regex assumes one password per line; yours looks between words `(?:\s|^)...(?:\s|$)`, so you would want it to stop matching if it encounters any kind of whitespace.
[01:37:20] <reindeer-90> You're suggesting updating that 2nd line like this, right? `(?=[^A-Za-z\s]*[A-Za-z])`
[01:37:35] <OnlineCop> Yeah. https://regex101.com/r/dMPNRa/2
[01:38:08] <reindeer-90> It's got a ton of false positives currently. Any word that's 8+ char seems to flag and I'm trying to resolve that
[01:38:13] <reindeer-90> using the same pattern that you've got going
[01:38:20] <OnlineCop> In version /1 or /2 ?
[01:38:25] <reindeer-90> 1
[01:38:28] <reindeer-90> let me look at 2
[01:38:38] <OnlineCop> That's because it didn't stop when it encountered whitespace.

[11:24:54] <Rahul> need to get the date for Tender submission deadline:
[11:25:14] <Rahul> i am able to achieve this but i guess my regex is noob :)
[11:25:59] <digitok> i assume you missed the 'T'
[11:26:01] <digitok> in the data
[11:26:21] <Rahul> yes correct
[11:26:33] <Rahul> i used this \d+[.]\s\S*\s\d+
[11:26:36] <digitok> .net right?
[11:26:40] <Rahul> and i get the required data
[11:26:41] <Rahul> yes
[11:26:43] <Rahul> .net
[11:26:48] <digitok> would checking for "deadline:" be enough?
[11:26:56] <Rahul> yes
[11:27:05] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/AZfJSg/2
[11:28:18] <digitok> of course just matching the first date is ok too
[11:28:49] <digitok> i.e. removing the lookbehind
[11:28:52] <qswz> ok
[11:29:16] <Rahul> working as expected !

[11:29:38] <qswz> this is my expression
[11:29:45] <digitok> yea, that won't work

[11:32:51] <digitok> maybe something like that
[11:33:04] <digitok> although if you're expecting a digit, i'm not sure why you'd bother lowercasing the value
[11:34:53] <qswz> because we save search terms (that we match against in DB) already lowercased

[11:35:24] <digitok> sure, but you don't need them lowercased for this regex
[11:35:36] <qswz> thanks will do what you siggest
[11:35:42] <digitok> np
[11:36:01] <qswz> if I add the "i" regex flag you mean?
[11:36:12] <digitok> no
[11:36:29] <qswz> rest won't always be numbers
[11:36:35] <qswz> it can be anything
[11:36:38] <digitok> (?=\d)A will fail in the same was as (?=\d)a will fail
[11:36:47] <digitok> so there's no point changing the case
[11:36:54] <digitok> way*
[11:37:38] <qswz> ok I see what you mean, but I need something generic to match other cases, thanks
[11:38:03] <digitok> sure, then you'd probably define that variable before using it in this regex
[11:38:39] <digitok> no point repeating .tolowercase all over the place etc

[19:58:45] <re101-avocet-78> how do I go about asking for help with a regex?
[19:59:07] <OnlineCop> Usually post a link, if you have one, or describe what you're trying to do and what kind of data/text you're doing it on.

[20:00:01] <re101-avocet-78> I need to get all of these tags in a body
[20:00:03] <OnlineCop> You're capturing a '/' followed by word characters, followed by a '/'.

[20:00:45] <OnlineCop> If you use the '/g' flag, it will not stop after the 1st match is found.
[20:00:45] <re101-avocet-78> a match would be: /example_match/
[20:01:00] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/DZjzkB/2 simply adds the /g flag.
[20:01:51] <re101-avocet-78> wow
[20:02:02] <re101-avocet-78> thank you
[20:02:07] <OnlineCop> If you know that your input will have multiple things that you want to capture, you could put all of them into a single match, then refer to them by group name/number.
[20:02:44] <OnlineCop> For example, you have 'salutation_customer' followed by space followed by 'account_number'. If you wanted each of those captured, you would create a regex containing multiple (...) capture groups; one per item you wanted.
[20:03:39] <re101-avocet-78> those are unknown values

[20:04:35] <digitok> simplified version https://regex101.com/r/DZjzkB/4
[20:04:40] <OnlineCop> So long as you know what the pattern will look like (for example, I doubt that "date" will be just [[:word:]] characters; it probably has spaces, colons, commas, etc.), you could update each to match what you need.
[20:05:52] <digitok> i'm pretty sure he's just matching tag names, not values
[20:06:53] <OnlineCop> Sure, sure. I figure I'd ask dumb questions so I can figure out exactly what is wanted.

[21:39:40] <Rahul> 21059999 ignore
[21:39:54] <phunny> hmm
[21:40:03] <phunny> let me think. im not great at this :D
[21:41:37] <Rahul> (21\d{4}\s)
[21:41:40] <Rahul> this works
[21:41:57] <Rahul> but then if there is an _ after the 6digit it does not
[21:42:22] <phunny> how about (21\d{4}[^\d])
[21:44:13] <Rahul> it still captures the next Space or _

[21:44:54] <phunny> oops 1 sec
[21:45:07] <phunny> (21\d{4})[^\d] ?
[21:45:39] <purplex> Rahul: what's wrong with using 21\d{4} ? does it not capture 6 digits starting with 21?
[21:46:15] <phunny> yea but it capture bigger numbers
[21:46:22] <phunny> he only want 6 digit
[21:46:29] <Rahul> it captures 6 digits but if a number is beyond 6 digits it still captures its
[21:46:33] <Rahul> first 6 digits
[21:49:30] <Rahul> phunny yes this works (21\d{4})[^\d] ?
[21:50:07] <phunny> theres one case though
[21:50:29] <phunny> https://regex101.com/r/y2q5vy/1
[21:50:30] <phunny> see last
[21:51:12] <Rahul> that's ok..it is always going to be one line
[21:51:16] <Rahul> no multiline
[21:52:43] <phunny> this is a problem though? https://regex101.com/r/DJ7kug/1
[21:52:57] <phunny> maybe purplex can help us satify this case ;D
[21:53:42] <purplex> I would use (?!\d) instead of [^\d]
[21:54:55] <phunny> thank u. i dont know wht negative lookahead is
[21:55:13] <phunny> i lrn abt it today
[21:55:26] <Rahul> (21\d{4})(?!\d)
[21:55:31] <Rahul> is this correct?
[21:55:39] <phunny> yes its working
[21:57:40] <Rahul> phunny purplex thanks Guys

[22:01:04] <purplex> its a bit tricky one, if you had 7 digits it will match a part digits of it https://regex101.com/r/XNlcoJ/1 i suppose you don't want that?
[22:01:56] <Rahul> ahh no
[22:02:01] <Rahul> i dont need that
[22:02:32] <purplex> then you want https://regex101.com/r/XNlcoJ/2
[22:02:59] <Rahul> the _ at the end
[22:03:08] <Rahul> it can be a space or a , or anything
[22:04:07] <purplex> yes it will work with space
[22:04:13] <purplex> or comma
[22:04:26] <Rahul> yes it works
[22:05:26] <purplex> I added _ to exclude it from \b, it doesn't mean it will match only with _
[22:06:08] <Rahul> yes it works

[23:06:15] <re101-duck-90> thanks for pointing that out purplex
[23:06:37] <purplex> To further make sure file name and extension exists I changed it to .+ https://regex101.com/r/fvh3Mo/3 this one is more reliable
[23:06:43] <purplex> welcome
[23:15:55] <re101-duck-90> thanks mate!!!
[23:24:03] <re101-duck-90> purplex is there a way to make it fail if it doesnt end with .txt or .png or .xls ?
[23:24:08] <re101-duck-90> for example
[23:24:46] <re101-duck-90> it doesnt have to be a particular file format 
[23:25:14] <re101-duck-90> but it shoud fail if its like this /foo/bar/folder.fr/bean
[23:27:41] <re101-duck-90> can we make it fail in this scenario? https://regex101.com/r/ODUF9y/1
[23:29:29] <re101-duck-90> or maybe only accept it when it ends with .txt

[23:35:37] <purplex> Right. It doesn't validate file names for special characters. I assumed they would be valid. To make it validate file names, \w can be used https://regex101.com/r/ODUF9y/2 
[23:37:43] <purplex> After that, if you want only certain extensions, you can add them like this https://regex101.com/r/ODUF9y/3
[23:40:39] <re101-duck-90> this is awesome! Thank you
[23:42:14] *** Joins: nvmd (~nvmd@user/nvmd)
[23:47:56] <purplex> re101-duck-90: If you know exactly what characters are allowed in filename, it is possible to add them too.
[23:49:16] <purplex> Like (.+) won't validate the filename, but it will capture any filename, but \w will capture only letters, digits and _ in fillename
