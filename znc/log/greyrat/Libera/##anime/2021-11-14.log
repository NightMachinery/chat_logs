[07:20:12] <amigojapan> Boradt: I think if I get the right watch, it can alert me if I left my phone behind
[07:20:36] <amigojapan> Board when BT disconnects
[07:21:13] <amigojapan> Which may be too late for the bus or train

[07:25:16] <amigojapan> Boradt: Google sensei says "Thanks to a free, simple Wearable App called Never Lose Your Phone, it is now simple to prevent losing ones phone if you have an Android Smart Watch. The Smart Watch App simply vibrates and notifies the user on their Smart Watch that they have left their Smartphone behind"
[07:26:07] <Boradt> But why spending a lot of money on a watch, when you can just buy a rope thingy and tie your phone to yourself
[07:27:27] <amigojapan> Boradt: cause that is conversome and the watches are not that expensive

[07:33:26] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I'll be more chatty in just a bit, trying to debate computers to buy
[07:33:37] <TsundereNoises> Sxem: Yeah, I can't stand having a watch on my wrist either
[07:33:53] <amigojapan> Ok TsundereNoises 
[07:34:07] <Sxem> i can never forget im wearing it. im always hyper aware of it
[07:35:13] <TsundereNoises> and it bothers me whenever I wash my hands
[07:35:13] <Sxem> maybe they will invent a new watch that is an implant that generates a 3d hologram. id be more into that
[07:35:15] <TsundereNoises> which is a lot

[07:37:04] <TsundereNoises> which feels weird
[07:37:23] <amigojapan> Watch proof usually means they can be worn in the rain
[07:37:49] <amigojapan> Water
[07:37:50] <MootPoot> I ordered a can of those beans
[07:38:13] <Sxem> no, ive seen watches that claim to be waterproof up to a depth of 10 feet or something
[07:38:21] <Sxem> it doesnt seem beleivable tho
[07:38:42] <Sxem> itd probably get ruined just by showering with it

[07:40:44] <amigojapan> Sxem: I had a watch that was water proof in the 90s and it was actually usable in a pool. But it did not prevent it against getting corroded

[07:42:28] <Satin> MootPoot: is it bad i've barely drank water and am sipping brisk iced tea cans
[07:42:33] <Satin> for 2 days
[07:42:53] <MootPoot> It's fine 
[07:43:00] <MootPoot> Just uh 
[07:43:06] <MootPoot> That's a lotta sugar
[07:43:07] <Sadale> ouch. But why? :(
[07:44:12] <Satin> meh
[07:44:22] <Satin> Probably better than drinking loads of redbull still Lol
[07:44:27] <Sadale> true xD
[07:44:37] <MootPoot> Ive been drinking more water recently 
[07:44:40] <MootPoot> Less monster 
[07:44:57] <MootPoot> Mainly because I'm on keto and it's expensive..but I also don't feel like I need the kick anymore

[07:46:49] <MootPoot> Lul
[07:46:53] * Satin slaps MootPoot around with a large fish
[07:47:00] <MootPoot> It's mainly a mix of chicken, beef and fish 
[07:47:03] <MootPoot> Mainly chicken 
[07:47:15] <Satin> so you've been learning to cook?
[07:47:30] <MootPoot> I guess I've gotten better at handling meat but that's it 
[07:47:33] <ButterNoodle> he's gonna make a proper wife soon enough

[07:54:50] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: shut your mouth, whore
[07:54:51] <Boradt> i need to find a way to stop feeling exhausuted and tired every day
[07:54:53] <Sadale> MootPoot, wow you fat :P
[07:54:59] <Boradt> and to regain willpower
[07:54:59] <Sadale> MootPoot, I think I'm like 50kg or so.
[07:55:03] * MootPoot makes a face at Sadale 
[07:55:12] <Satin> Sadale: I'm probably fat too, I just odn't have an exact number
[07:55:18] <Satin> cuz i haven't weighd in a while
[07:55:19] <MootPoot> you have to be thin otherwise you cant make room on your single bed to cuddle with your imouto Sadale 
[07:55:20] <Boradt> i felt dead inside for a long time
[07:55:25] <Boradt> how to make it stop
[07:55:27] <MootPoot> you have a good reason to not be fat
[07:55:33] <Sadale> MootPoot, jk. It has to do with race and gene. Me Asian. We're lighter than the western people
[07:55:40] <Sadale> MootPoot, lol
[07:55:44] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I will be much more active in like an hour if you're still around
[07:55:45] <MootPoot> Sadale: its the lifestyle here that does it 
[07:55:49] <MootPoot> you need a car to do anything
[07:55:53] <Sadale> ah
[07:55:54] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: can I pick your brain in PM about computer parts
[07:56:02] <Satin> nah i'm not exactly white either sadale, and it's easy to be fat if you don't watch out, as a westerner
[07:56:05] <MootPoot> walking and transit is heavily avoided in every aspect
[07:56:07] <Satin> TsundereNoises:  I might be c:
[07:56:14] <Sadale> aw :3
[07:56:15] <Satin> I woke up after a 2h nap
[07:56:16] <MootPoot> Satin: the world is setup against you here
[07:56:20] <MootPoot> to make you fat
[07:56:22] <Satin> MootPoot:  yep
[07:56:24] <MootPoot> everything requires a car
[07:56:25] <TsundereNoises> Satin: by 2h you mean like 8 months
[07:56:28] <Satin> NO OMG
[07:56:31] <Sadale> cow. moo moo! :P
[07:56:33] <Satin> def not!!
[07:56:33] <MootPoot> sugar and fat in pounds
[07:56:35] <Satin> lmaoooo
[07:56:43] <TsundereNoises> it's time to summon your monsters and conquer Earth, Satin
[07:56:44] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: just ask
[07:56:56] <MootPoot> dont try to take my husband away from me though
[07:57:01] <Sadale> In Cantonese we mock fat people "pig". In English they call fat people "cow".
[07:57:06] <Omega037> morning yall
[07:57:06] <MootPoot> moo
[07:57:15] <Satin> Boradt:  I mean I'm hypocritical when I say this, because I'm dealing with this too, but it's important to try to *create* purpose too rather than just discover it
[07:57:20] <Omega037> There are a lot of words for fat people in english
[07:57:25] <MootPoot> whale
[07:57:35] <Satin> i love whales....
[07:57:36] <Boradt> but how Satin when i don't feel like doing anything
[07:57:39] <Omega037> I think any large animal can be used
[07:57:41] <Sadale> Omega037, interesting. What else other than cow?
[07:57:42] <Boradt> living hurts
[07:57:47] <Sadale> oh. whale. cow. etc.
[07:57:54] <Sadale> oh. In Cantonese we could call fat people elephant as well xD
[07:57:59] <Sadale> so pig or elephant
[07:58:01] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: Ryzen 7 4700G vs Intel i7 10th gen 10700F, how big a difference is there, enough to care?
[07:58:03] <Omega037> Hippo
[07:58:14] <Omega037> Pig is used plenty, though it can mean messy too
[07:58:21] <Satin> Boradt:  it's important to have a mindset less geared around "feling perfect to do something" and more around "i just need to do this, it's the right thing for me"
[07:58:26] <Omega037> People use animal metaphors all the time
[07:58:27] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: depends on your task 
[07:58:27] <Sadale> I think ryzen's often better for iGPUY
[07:58:40] <Boradt> TsundereNoises discrete gpu or integrated?
[07:58:53] <Nanobot> I was going to make a joke about how the name Cobbler comes from shoe repairmen, and then imply that Adam Sandler's ancestors repaired sandles, but the joke needs some workshopping.
[07:58:56] <Sadale> Omega037, https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/lkss0o/i_yelled_cow_at_a_woman_on_bike/
[07:58:56] <Boradt> ryzen hass better igpu and they seem to be better cpus overall these days
[07:58:58] <ImoutoBot> [title] I yelled "COW!" at a woman on bike : Jokes
[07:59:14] <Satin> Boradt:  aka stop caring about how you're feeling excessively, it's important to listen to your body/mind for sure. but when you start letting the "feeling like doing/not doing it" have too high priority, that's not going to be good either
[07:59:28] <Satin> question of*
[08:00:05] <Satin> where's the systen information file thing so i can flex on mootpoot
[08:00:11] <MootPoot> Sadale: before I come to HK I'll make sure to be thin or at least like 80kg so all the people there doint point and call me fat
[08:00:23] <Sadale> MootPoot, haha
[08:00:32] <Sadale> MootPoot, I mean it's fine to be fat as a foreigner :P
[08:00:40] <MootPoot> But then no cute HK girls
[08:00:49] <Omega037> HK girls arent cute
[08:00:55] <Omega037> So it is moot
[08:00:55] <Satin> wrong
[08:01:01] <Sadale> MootPoot, I'm actually not so sure. Maybe some girls like fat guys.
[08:01:01] <Satin> luke-jr:  yo are you around
[08:01:08] <Omega037> I don't find most asian women attractive
[08:01:11] <MootPoot> he aint here Satin 
[08:01:12] <TsundereNoises> it's complicated because think I'm agreeing with what Emmeka said yesterday and just buying a prebuilt one and maybe upgrading later, so the Ryzen is just the integrated graphics, the intel comes with a Radeon RX 550, but I could always buy graphics card later, and I'm (for reasons given in whole conversation yesterday) unsure how much I care
[08:01:15] <Satin> RIP
[08:01:17] <Omega037> I prefer women with breasts and asses
[08:01:24] <TsundereNoises> so I'm kind of trying to assign a dollar value to unknown things I don't know how I feel about
[08:01:28] <MootPoot> he logs here but he's turned into the self-made king of the old #anime in freenode Satin 
[08:01:29] <TsundereNoises> which is tough
[08:01:34] <Satin> Omega037: weird, you're being weird for someone in an #anime channel!!!! 
[08:01:39] <Satin> no yellow fever?????
[08:01:41] <Sadale> Omega037, I actually find western girls more attractive. Probably because that's the kind of porn I'd come across online. xD
[08:01:47] <MootPoot> Sadale: I got banned there for asking about you lol
[08:01:47] <Omega037> Satin, I actually lived in Japan a couple years
[08:01:50] <MootPoot> wait no
[08:01:54] <Satin> Omega037: i remember that
[08:01:55] <emmeka> TsundereNoises you could also just upgrade the graphics later on one with integrated graphics
[08:01:57] <Omega037> Some guys had huge yellow fever
[08:02:00] <Sadale> MootPoot, wat?
[08:02:00] <MootPoot> Satin: I got banned there for asking about you
[08:02:03] <Omega037> I hooked up with other foreigners
[08:02:08] <MootPoot> Sadale: wrong tag
[08:02:09] <Satin> MootPoot: lol what?
[08:02:14] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: yeah, exactly, which is why I'm kind of debating HOW MUCH better the chip is
[08:02:14] <Omega037> Women were not much of an interest of mine
[08:02:17] <Boradt> TsundereNoises that ryzen integrated gpu may very well be on par or better than rx 550 in that intel laptop
[08:02:17] <emmeka> TsundereNoises but, it's not worth doing to a prebuilt.
[08:02:22] <Boradt> check some benchmarks
[08:02:29] <Satin> Omega037: i mean you have a wife... i would hope they aren't
[08:02:31] <Satin> :p
[08:02:34] <emmeka> it is, when I checked
[08:02:40] <Omega037> I'm saying, it isn't why I went
[08:02:40] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: why not? I'm looking at towers not laptops
[08:02:45] <MootPoot> Satin: yeah after the divide I went to freenode to ask about you if anyone told you about the linode change - luke banned me in 30sec and I never went back
[08:02:47] <TsundereNoises> Boradt: thanks
[08:02:50] <Satin> Omega037: ah gotcha
[08:02:52] <Omega037> And I never pursued any Japanese girls
[08:03:01] <MootPoot> damn this channel is popping off 
[08:03:03] <Sadale> Satin, actually there was a drama of ##anime when it moved to Libera.
[08:03:06] <MootPoot> all bc satin is here
[08:03:12] <Satin> MootPoot: nottrue
[08:03:13] <MootPoot> what a good husband
[08:03:21] <Satin> Sadale: i know there was, i was there for a bit you know
[08:03:22] <MootPoot> emmeka: I've become wife to Satin now
[08:03:28] <Satin> i joined the #anime channel (not ##anime)
[08:03:30] <Omega037> I felt up like 500 of their boobs though
[08:03:33] <emmeka> MootPoot sounds unlikely
[08:03:45] <MootPoot> emmeka: its true of about 10min ago
[08:03:48] <Satin> Omega037: why because they offered it or you were peer presusred to visit the brothels?
[08:03:49] <Omega037> Japanese people are weirdly open when drunk
[08:03:53] <Sadale> Satin, ah. After some ordeal we managed to move to ##anime. And now both #anime freenode and ##anime freenode had merged into ##anime libera
[08:03:53] <MootPoot> things move fast these days
[08:03:54] <Satin> lolz
[08:03:55] <emmeka> TsundereNoises because they have low wattage PSU which you'd also have to upgrade because graphics cards take power that these PCs were not designed to give
[08:04:01] <Omega037> I was a chubby guy myself
[08:04:02] *** Joins: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade)
[08:04:07] <Satin> Sadale: nice
[08:04:08] <Omega037> I would let them feel my moobs
[08:04:14] <emmeka> TsundereNoises also, cases not designed to cool nice GPUs
[08:04:18] <Omega037> And we would "compare"
[08:04:27] <TsundereNoises> emmeka, MootPoot, Boradt: okay so better processor it is, thanks all
[08:04:28] <Satin> Sadale: yeah a mix of me being busy irl and also not liking any community in the middle of change/drama made me not join here after a while
[08:04:34] <Satin> i was waiting for the dust to settle as well
[08:04:34] <Omega037> Note that these would include coworkers, mothers of my students, etc
[08:04:38] <emmeka> TsundereNoises and anyway, the 5700G APU is actually significantly better all on its own than an RX 550
[08:04:41] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: honestly the case on the other one is basically the same (not sure it's "well designed"
[08:04:46] <emmeka> this was my conclusion, at least
[08:04:54] <TsundereNoises> thanks
[08:04:57] <Satin> Omega037: weird lol
[08:05:01] <Omega037> Sometimes you would meet a stacked Japanese girl though
[08:05:20] <Omega037> Or a halfu
[08:05:31] <Satin> Omega037: so your wife ended up being jewish like you or?
[08:05:40] <Omega037> Not exactly
[08:05:46] <Satin> Oh okay
[08:05:50] <Omega037> She wasnt born Jewish
[08:05:51] <emmeka> TsundereNoises I think the best reasonable low budget prebuilt you could get right now as a linux user was that office depot one I linked you, if you can find it, just because it has a 5700G. 
[08:06:07] <Omega037> That wasn't the reason though
[08:06:27] <Satin> I don't know much about Jewish people, so forgive me if I say weird stuff. Born Southern Baptist Evangelical here
[08:06:28] <Omega037> And honestly, if I had spent my time in Japan chasing tail, it would have been such a waste of an experience
[08:06:35] <Satin> lol
[08:06:36] <Omega037> Satin, it is a bit of a touchy thing
[08:06:38] <Sadale> Satin, so, does that mean that you're coming back to this channel? :D
[08:06:43] <Satin> Omega037: yeah understandable
[08:06:56] <Omega037> Jews really aren't supposed to marry outside, and Jews aren't very accepting of converts
[08:07:10] <Omega037> To many Jews, my wife and kids will never be truly Jewish
[08:07:17] <Satin> Sadale: Idk, I'm here and i'm not going anywhere, I can't gurantee I'll be entirely active because I'm in the middle of finding my grip on life, but yeah i'm here :)
[08:07:23] <Omega037> To them, I say they can go fuck themsleves
[08:07:32] <Nanobot> Omega037: They'll just be Jewishish?
[08:07:35] <Satin> Omega037: I see. how are your immediate family/parents about it?
[08:07:38] <Omega037> No, it is binary
[08:07:45] <Omega037> To them, they simply aren't Jewish at all
[08:07:53] <Sadale> Satin, welcome back! :3
[08:07:55] <Omega037> We use matrilineal descent
[08:07:57] <Satin> I watched Uncut Gems (2019) which has some Jews in it, and Adam Sandler is a Jewish trader, recently
[08:08:02] <Satin> diamond*
[08:08:06] <Satin> it is very uh, yeah, interesting
[08:08:10] <ButterNoodle> jewish by blood..
[08:08:20] <TsundereNoises> I really liked that movie
[08:08:27] <ButterNoodle> :)
[08:08:34] <Omega037> My kids are Mischlings, as the Nazis would say
[08:08:36] <TsundereNoises> the opening is a bit ass though
[08:08:44] <Satin> Omega037: do you think this is an American jews thing or just a jewish all over the world and in israel thing - the thing you're mentioning about being touchy about marrying anyone not-jewish-by-blood?
[08:09:00] <MootPoot> one of these days I will get a gf
[08:09:01] <MootPoot> somehow
[08:09:03] <Omega037> Marrying non-Jews is seen badly by almost all Jews
[08:09:04] <MootPoot> probably now
[08:09:09] <Omega037> Reform Jews would accept my wife and kids
[08:09:12] <MootPoot> not*
[08:09:14] <Omega037> Some conservative
[08:09:15] <Satin> one of these days I will get a gluten free bun somehow
[08:09:22] <Omega037> Orthodox would not, and Hassidic would really not
[08:09:26] <MootPoot> Satin: why do you want  a bad bun
[08:09:30] <Satin> Omega037:  I see
[08:09:39] <ButterNoodle> keto buns
[08:09:42] <ButterNoodle> they exist
[08:09:46] <Satin> MootPoot: lol idk, when i worked at chic fil A, we'd have GF bun orders on the screen sometimes
[08:09:47] <Satin> it was funny
[08:09:53] <emmeka> Omega037 otoh, it is your duty to commit rassenschande and make Hitler's corpse weep
[08:10:03] <Omega037> This despite the fact that we are active members of our temple, we do Shabbat every week, my wife has done a lot of study for conversion, etc
[08:10:13] <emmeka> so don't let the haters get to you
[08:10:26] <Satin> I see.
[08:10:32] <Omega037> But then again, these are also the people who think women wearing pants should have stones thrown at them and they all have to shave their heads and wear wigs
[08:10:38] <Satin> Omega037: are west coast jews different from east coast jews culturually and all of that/
[08:10:40] <Satin> ?*
[08:10:46] <Omega037> Satin, in the US
[08:10:46] <Satin> or are they as strict and all
[08:10:49] <Omega037> To an extent
[08:11:17] <Omega037> I grew up in the South, so I didn't even know what a JAP was until I was like 16
[08:11:30] * Satin doesn't know what a JAP means either
[08:11:38] <Omega037> Jewish American Princess
[08:11:42] <Satin> Lol wtf
[08:12:01] <Omega037> Went on my USY Trip to Israel, and there were certainly the NY/NJ group, the LA group, and the Chicago group
[08:12:04] <emmeka> downsides though... the stricter the Jew, the better the fucking bagels they make. The Hasidim run all the best bagel shops in Montréal
[08:12:05] <Omega037> I was an "other"
[08:12:09] <Satin> lol
[08:12:11] <Satin> yeah
[08:12:17] <ButterNoodle> to convert to catholicism you just have to open ur heart to the holy trinity.. and ur wallet
[08:12:18] <Satin> you don't hear of that many jews from the south
[08:12:44] <Omega037> In general, the larger the group, the more interal conflict
[08:13:01] <Omega037> It was a great story I was told by an old expat in Japan
[08:13:02] <MootPoot> how much sex before I can create my own religion
[08:13:23] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: ask david koresh 
[08:13:26] <Omega037> He came over in the 70s, and said back then if you saw another foreigner, you would immediately get together, have drinks, etc
[08:13:27] <ButterNoodle> wait...
[08:13:27] <emmeka> MootPoot apparently having negative sex and being a virgin birth helps, so maybe the less sex the better?
[08:13:36] <Omega037> Like some random Nigerian, it was like meeting a brother
[08:13:42] <MootPoot> emmeka: then how do those weird sex cults come about
[08:14:03] <Omega037> Then as foreigners become more common, you get less of that and more cliques
[08:14:05] <Satin> Omega037: the world was a lot less globalized back then
[08:14:09] <TsundereNoises> hey emmeka, how much better do you think the 5700G is than the 4700G?
[08:14:10] <Satin> yeah
[08:14:14] <Omega037> Now you don't want to hang out with "those" foreigners
[08:14:16] <TsundereNoises> like is that a big thing or slightly improved

[08:16:26] <Omega037> The difference is what is done when caught
[08:16:26] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: though if I have a canvas strap, I have to take it off to dry it afterwards
[08:16:27] <MootPoot> amigojapan: I'm running debain 11, will this still work
[08:16:39] <Omega037> Catholic church covers up and moves a priest
[08:16:45] <Satin> Omega037:  lol true
[08:16:48] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: and when washing hands, I mostly get the crown splashed
[08:17:15] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it should
[08:17:15] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: rarely do I end up with a wet strap that goes under it (if it's one with a canvas strap), but that's usually OK, too
[08:17:19] <Omega037> Any time you have a position of power or moral authority, some of them are gonna fail to meet that moral bar
[08:17:50] <Satin> yeah

[08:18:41] <Satin> I'm glad religion is seemingly dying out, even though I'm sad and afraid about what will be left in its wake tbh
[08:18:54] <Omega037> amigojapan, did you not learn any prayers?
[08:18:57] <Satin> I'm a person of color in new mexico 💀

[08:19:05] <amigojapan> Yes Omega037 
[08:19:13] <Omega037> Satin, moral belief systems aren't dying out
[08:19:14] <ButterNoodle> :)
[08:19:20] <Nanobot> I was about to make a joke about the largest tax hike in American history, referring to a very long tax-funded hiking trail, but it took too much effort to figure out the actual funding sources of the largest hiking trails, so this is the best you get.
[08:19:21] <Omega037> Maybe some of the traditional ones are, but only some
[08:19:25] <ButterNoodle> colored people in mexico..
[08:19:30] <Satin> new mexico****
[08:19:34] <ButterNoodle> ic
[08:19:37] <Satin> i mean
[08:19:42] <ButterNoodle> mexico in the new world
[08:19:43] <Satin> there's not a single black person down here lmafo

[08:19:59] <amigojapan> Omega037: barruch ATA Adonai eloheino melech haolam borei pre hagofen
[08:20:02] <ButterNoodle> wonder why
[08:20:16] <Satin> Omega037:  Yeah at least in the US, it's not like in Europe - the unchurched are increasing but religion itself isn't dying out
[08:20:29] <Satin> I still say religion is dying out though because participation in church etc is declining
[08:20:33] <Omega037> For some, politics is the new religion
[08:20:42] <Satin> ButterNoodle: geography and all 
[08:20:49] <Omega037> I think a lot of people are struggling to find community
[08:20:51] <Satin> it's far more latinos here
[08:21:01] <ButterNoodle> yep
[08:21:06] <ButterNoodle> I have a good mix here
[08:21:11] <Satin> and also new mexico is only 2 million
[08:21:14] <Satin> like kansas sized
[08:21:20] <amigojapan> Omega037: time to open more conversation cafes
[08:21:22] <Satin> (i hate kansas, fuck you stupid flat state)
[08:21:29] <Satin> Omega037:  yeah that's why I said I'm afraid of what is left in its wake
[08:21:37] <Satin> in the wake of that decline*
[08:21:45] <SummerSkies> what if blue was a skin color
[08:21:59] <Satin> more netflix and suburban homes and capitalism? what community and moral systems do you get afterwards?
[08:22:10] <SummerSkies> i wonder what their culture would be
[08:22:13] <Satin> in philosophy, the postmodernists sort of warned about that decades ago
[08:22:33] <Satin> consumerism and image signifiers taking over meaning
[08:23:00] <emmeka> TsundereNoises in that video, anything below 60fps = bad, and basically, the 5700G is actually good enough graphics all on its own to play major titles right now on 1080p low, or 720p high. That other one is last gen, and a little mediocre for that too.
[08:23:07] <Satin> and a struggle as "established narratives" become exposed and we have to get used to a very heavily differing narratives world
[08:23:15] <amigojapan> Satin: I am a cultural Jew not a religious Jew

[08:24:16] <Satin> "Reality, then, is a kind of literary fiction which we all create based upon our experiences and the information we encounter. The characters we meet are all writing their own stories, many of which don’t correspond with ours. And that can be frustrating, because we humans want desperately to believe that there are some things we all hold dear and understand as valuable. Maybe that’s the universal truth: the desire to share a point of view."
[08:24:32] <Satin> and part of the breakdown in those sort of established narratives is def a decline in religion as well

[08:34:22] <amigojapan> Being judgmental of it and all
[08:34:27] <emmeka> where he clearly tried to install something as a .deb he pulled off the web somewhere

[08:35:58] <emmeka> ok but what the hell did you do
[08:35:58] * Satin facepalms
[08:36:05] <Satin> yeah what happened pooty
[08:36:05] <ButterNoodle> and u were running manjaro.. its mixed up lil 1/2 cousin
[08:36:13] <MootPoot> virtualbox was being a pain - okay, I have to unmount the iso from inside debian first
[08:36:21] <Satin> rip
[08:36:28] <MootPoot> I cant just unmount from virtualbox control panel
[08:36:28] <MootPoot> I see
[08:37:11] <amigojapan> MootPoot: why are you installing a deb file, that is insecure, you are a n00b and should stick to safe methods
[08:37:29] <Satin> Tbh I've tried to install deb files before too /shrug
[08:37:31] <ButterNoodle> :cringe:
[08:37:34] <amigojapan> MootPoot: deb files can contain malware
[08:37:38] <Satin> but obviously from places I trusted
[08:37:40] <MootPoot> Its a boxed off VM, why is it a problem
[08:37:45] <ButterNoodle> ur shitting me amigojapan...
[08:37:46] <MootPoot> I'll just yeet the box and make a new one
[08:37:53] <ButterNoodle> .deb is the package
[08:37:58] <Satin> what was the deb for, if i could ask?
[08:38:05] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: not even taking to you now
[08:38:09] <ButterNoodle> lol
[08:38:11] <MootPoot> Satin: I was just trying to install teamviewer
[08:38:15] <Satin> ah
[08:38:18] <Satin> yeah that shit is annoying
[08:38:21] <MootPoot> apparently you need to install it via deb first
[08:38:22] <ButterNoodle> all packages on debian are .deb n00b
[08:38:30] <emmeka> ButterNoodle he knows that ofc
[08:38:32] <MootPoot> then it'll add its link in so you can terminal update it
[08:38:35] <MootPoot> tc
[08:38:36] <MootPoot> etc
[08:38:38] <emmeka> but why would you be installing something from a .deb file?
[08:38:43] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: but they are malware /s
[08:38:43] <Satin> is that instructions from the teamviewer page?
[08:38:49] <Satin> do they not have an apt package?
[08:38:54] <emmeka> ButterNoodle no, but he's still doing it wrong
[08:38:59] <ButterNoodle> probably
[08:39:04] <MootPoot> Satin: nien - it adds it in when you install the deb seems like
[08:39:05] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: yeah I know that but I assume he got this deb file from the web
[08:39:09] <MootPoot> there is no apt-get install teamviewer
[08:39:13] <emmeka> there's no scenario in which you should have downloaded a .deb file and install from that
[08:39:16] <emmeka> basically ever
[08:39:20] <MootPoot> unless you've already installed it 
[08:39:22] <MootPoot> seems like

[08:40:11] <Satin> Lmao
[08:40:24] <Boradt> MootPoot I'd just like to interject for moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system

[08:40:26] <Boradt> Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
[08:40:26] <Boradt> There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a
[08:40:26] <Boradt> complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!

[08:44:44] <ImoutoBot> [image/jpeg] 155kB
[08:44:57] <Satin> there is a way you can avoid downloading the .deb by enabling multi-architecture stuff
[08:44:58] <amigojapan> Satin: but the Linux TeamViewer is buggy
[08:44:58] <emmeka> ButterNoodle well I wouldn't just add repos from anywhere, but I'm not super familiar with Debian repositories. For me, there's a non-free but official fedora repo which isn't added by default and all proprietary shit is in there.
[08:45:07] <Satin> and then you can do apt-get etc for the 32 bit version of team viewer
[08:45:15] <amigojapan> Satin: it may not even work
[08:45:26] <Satin> amigojapan: yep, but it's worth a shot IMO since he wants to try it

[08:47:42] <emmeka> tbf, amigojapan did say that :P

[08:57:47] <Satin> i am debating of moving over to opensuse tumbleweed or something
[08:58:08] <amigojapan> Satin: that is also a rolling distro, so I avoided it
[08:58:19] <Satin> doesn't opensuse have two distro versions
[08:58:28] <amigojapan> Maybe
[08:58:36] <emmeka> yeah, but why suse?
[08:58:53] <amigojapan> Suse is not bad
[08:59:06] <Satin> someone on discord was shilling it to me that it just works, unlike manjaro and other distributions based on ubuntu
[08:59:15] <Satin> and when i googled for its hybrid gpu laptop support
[08:59:20] <Satin> it seems up there?
[08:59:20] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: to my knowledge opensuse is geared towards developers and sysadmins, with probably best automation tools on Linux
[08:59:34] <Satin> the only reason i installed popOS is for its inbuilt emphasis on laptop hardware or whatever UI stuff
[08:59:43] <emmeka> I wouldn't trust any rolling release distro to "just work" personally, rolling release comes with having to unbreak things sometimes
[08:59:43] <Satin> i don't personally like the apt stuff
[08:59:48] <Satin> hm i see
[08:59:49] <Satin> well
[08:59:57] <Satin> there is opensuse leap
[09:00:00] <Satin> and opensuse tumbleweed
[09:00:05] <Satin> i forget which one, but one of them is rolling
[09:00:19] <Satin> > The openSUSE Tumbleweed distribution is the rolling release version of openSUSE containing the newest stable applications including such things as an updated Linux kernel, SAMBA, git, desktops, and office applications.
[09:00:26] <Satin> so leap is the one that isn't rolling
[09:00:27] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: I've only used it in uni, as the workstations in the computer lab were opensuse, backend servers were debian
[09:00:36] <Satin> Urchin[emacs]: how was your experience?
[09:00:44] <Satin> to be honest I didn't know people even used suse still lol
[09:00:46] <emmeka> Satin if you wanna play with .rpms there's Fedora.
[09:00:52] <Satin> lol
[09:00:54] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: it did it's job
[09:00:54] <amigojapan> I agree with emmeka on rolling releases
[09:01:07] <Satin> I am fine with rolling releases as long as i can get unfucked relatively easily
[09:01:11] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: nothing in particular to say about it, never set it up or anything along those lines
[09:01:17] <Satin> I'm very sensitive to my distro workikng with my hardware though
[09:01:25] <Satin> I don't want to see stupid cringe driver issues like i did growing up randomly
[09:01:30] <Satin> with network and graphic drivers
[09:01:31] <emmeka> I like how trivial the version upgrade process is on Fedora, their strategy is the opposite of rolling release.
[09:01:44] <Satin> i also want robust hybrid gpu support pwease
[09:01:59] <Satin> popOS goes to 90c when playing video on my 4k monitor on my laptop hooked up to 3 screens

[09:56:54] <Satin> one of the fundamental assertions of refold/MIA is that

[09:57:07] <MootPoot> deb11 vm Boradt

[10:02:44] <Satin> a) do they really make outlandish claims that "YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT WRONG ALL ALONG"? I don't see much of that
[10:02:55] <Satin> b) it's not really paid content as far as i've seen
[10:03:07] <Satin> (though even non-paid content can be snake oil for sure)
[10:03:08] <TsundereNoises> Satin: it's been hugely profitable for a few people
[10:03:12] <Satin> oof i see

[10:03:19] <TsundereNoises> but also that kind of takes off
[10:03:19] <ImoutoBot> [youtube] Daft Punk ft. Panda Bear - Doin' it Right (Official Audio) | Duration: 4 minutes, 21 seconds
[10:03:23] <TsundereNoises> which is kind of why I called ita  cult
[10:03:46] <Satin> interesting
[10:03:50] <TsundereNoises> but like, you DO actually need to listen to people speak, I agree 100% (and so does everyone ever)
[10:04:00] <ButterNoodle> cats fed
[10:04:00] <Satin> for sure
[10:04:05] <ButterNoodle> snake fed again
[10:04:10] <Satin> but their argument/emphasis is to focus on listening/immersion all the time
[10:04:17] <Satin> to the point of having earbuds in your ears when you sleep if possible
[10:04:20] <Satin> listening in your car
[10:04:23] <Satin> and all of that stuff
[10:04:24] <TsundereNoises> the problem is, when you reduce it to the basics everyone agrees on, you lose the parts that actually make it a "method" or anything worth talking about
[10:04:32] <Satin> and you know what, for some DIY experimental people that might be the case
[10:04:36] <TsundereNoises> Satin: yeah, and that part is pseudoscience BS
[10:04:38] <Satin> idk really!
[10:04:41] <beaky> woah u have a snake girl like miia from monster musume?
[10:04:48] <ButterNoodle> yes beaky 
[10:04:51] <ButterNoodle> want to see her
[10:04:51] <Satin> TsundereNoises: is it really, how  many scientists have tested that?
[10:04:59] <ButterNoodle> I have lewds
[10:05:00] <Satin> (not saying that something can't be pseduoscience unless tested but still)
[10:05:14] <TsundereNoises> Satin: oh god, language research is fucking terrible, and the internet is full of people posting discredited studies from the 80s
[10:05:25] <Satin> (though i too found the "unconsicious brain learning language" part a bit ehh as well)
[10:05:34] <Satin> TsundereNoises: hahahahahaha
[10:05:40] <Satin> oh dear i know what you mean
[10:05:44] <TsundereNoises> Satin: so finding anything is so fucking tough, but I'm 99.9% the sleep learning stuff IS actually disproved quite well

[10:10:32] <TsundereNoises> Satin: also it's 2 AM and I've been at 2000% stress for about 4 hours

[10:14:59] <TsundereNoises> and thank you for the exclamation point

[10:15:48] <Satin> teflon 
[10:15:52] <Satin> is not good enough
[10:16:03] <MootPoot> do we know if pan teflon gives you cancer or not
[10:16:10] <Satin> TsundereNoises: you understand chemistry right? what's the deal with teflon?
[10:16:13] <MootPoot> I thought we knew making it gave you cancer ( by products )

[10:16:26] <Satin> tsuntsun chemistry
[10:16:29] <MootPoot> it might or might not react

[10:18:16] <Llamamoe> And I recognize MootPoot and TsundereNoises also :0 
[10:18:21] <Llamamoe> Greetings peoples
[10:18:26] <MootPoot> ITS LLAMA
[10:18:37] <Satin> howdy ho llamamoe
[10:18:51] <Llamamoe> Long time no see ^^
[10:19:07] <Satin> yus
[10:19:08] <TsundereNoises> Satin: as far as I understand it, chemicals from Teflon almost definitely cause cancer but not in a way you really need to worry about
[10:19:16] <Llamamoe> I've at some point made a habit of not logging into IRC to avoid getting distracted and procrastinating but I never got anything done anyway 
[10:19:16] <Satin> oo i see
[10:19:23] <TsundereNoises> Satin: like high concentration in lab rats is bad, and people working at factories have problems
[10:19:26] <Satin> Llamamoe: lol so relatable
[10:19:33] <Satin> with irc and discord both
[10:19:39] <Satin> TsundereNoises:  ahhhhhhhhhh
[10:19:43] <Satin> that makes sense
[10:19:45] <TsundereNoises> but also like 100% of everyone has some of those chemicals in their blood and we haven't seen cancer rates increase at that level

[10:22:36] <Satin> MootPoot: wdym wondering what to do
[10:22:38] <Satin> sleep?????????????
[10:22:45] <TsundereNoises> Satin: at a glance online, looks like most of the actual cancer worry by science people (rather than people with cookware related conspiracy theories) is about drinking water
[10:23:17] <TsundereNoises> chemical dumping -> lots of the chemicals in water is the source of human cancer increases as far as we know
[10:23:36] <TsundereNoises> because you don't need THAT high a concentration to do it, you just don't actually absorb much at all from pans
[10:23:44] <MootPoot> Satin: I woke up at like 3pm today , nowhere near sleepy
[10:23:46] <Satin> oh jeebus yeah i can imagine
[10:23:54] <TsundereNoises> ##anime IS my internet quality time
[10:23:54] <Satin> MootPoot: oh
[10:23:57] <TsundereNoises> spending time with my friends
[10:24:00] <TsundereNoises> and also MootPoot
[10:24:17] <Satin> MootPoot: one thing that always seems consistent with you is bad sleep schedules smh smh
[10:24:31] <Satin> though i'm no position to speak currently
[10:24:31] <TsundereNoises> about a week ago we were comparing how bad our handwriting was
[10:24:34] <TsundereNoises> that's news I guess
[10:24:36] <MootPoot> Why am I in a seperate category
[10:24:37] <Satin> *woke up at 1 pm yesterday*
[10:24:38] <TsundereNoises> I don't know, I've been thinking about it
[10:24:48] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: because I'm tsundere
[10:24:52] <TsundereNoises> baka

[10:25:01] <Satin> handwriting discussions?

[10:25:03] <MootPoot> ;$
[10:25:03] <Satin> lul
[10:25:18] <Satin> Llamamoe: how's the sleep apnea stuff goign?
[10:25:27] <Llamamoe> Knowing as much as I do about sleep disorders, I feel obliged to try to help people whenever any sleep issues come up, but like 
[10:25:27] <Satin> does gh0s1  still talk here as well
[10:25:32] <Llamamoe> Nobody even wants to hear anything about it 
[10:25:38] <MootPoot> Satin: surprisingly enough I don't have the worst handwriting in all of ##anime 
[10:25:44] <gh0s1> Go the fuck to sleep
[10:25:45] <Satin> who has the worst handwriting
[10:25:48] <Satin> gh0s1: LOL
[10:25:49] <Llamamoe> Because everyone internalized their sleep issues as their preference or psychology and they do not want those perceptions attacked 
[10:25:52] <MootPoot> Not me
[10:26:07] <Satin> Llamamoe: most people are like that about many things
[10:26:08] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I'm pretty sure I won for having the worst handwriting
[10:26:14] <MootPoot> We don't have a solid sampler of everyone here though 
[10:26:15] <Satin> yoou just gotta trod carefully, it's not your fault
[10:26:26] <Satin> TsundereNoises: "doctor handwriting" ?
[10:26:28] <Satin> or something else
[10:26:29] <Llamamoe> Satin: I'm more consistently not-quite-fucked-up thanks to optimizing my BiPAP treatment, but no progress yet on getting a job and getting surgery to fix the anatomical causes

[10:30:50] <Satin> its* IM SORRY

[10:30:54] <Satin> yeah
[10:30:57] <Satin> for sure
[10:31:02] <Satin> there's a lot of that recently with such topics
[10:31:23] <TsundereNoises> it's actually a bit older, 1992 originally
[10:31:26] <Satin> see at least you've read a part of it or all of it
[10:31:32] <Satin> i haven't read anything beyond a few pages of this book
[10:31:34] <Satin> GRRRRR
[10:31:36] <TsundereNoises> I think I'm going to try to push through
[10:31:40] <Satin> and i badly want to, i think about it, i need to act.

[10:31:52] <Satin> soseki a*
[10:32:04] <TsundereNoises> although I get frustrated about rightly making fun of Freud one moment, and really stretching to call something a "symbolic castration" the next

[10:33:30] <Satin> yeah for sure lol, but i'm silly sometimes and i would rather email regarding it
[10:33:31] <Satin> once i finish it
[10:33:37] <TsundereNoises> yeah
[10:33:37] <MootPoot> Teaching me anatomy
[10:33:40] <TsundereNoises> I've done that too
[10:33:42] <Satin> this is like illegal criminal actions rn
[10:33:48] <TsundereNoises> I KNOW
[10:33:48] <Satin> me, realizing fully well it's overdue
[10:33:50] <Satin> still waiting
[10:33:53] <Satin> till i finish it

[10:34:25] <Satin> (just don't ban me from the library ty)
[10:34:44] <Satin> it's so strange
[10:34:52] <Satin> i saw this book when i first visited the library this semester
[10:35:09] <Satin> and since covid and getting shot had stopped me from stoppying by in previous semesters
[10:35:16] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: that shit is above my house lol but I'll have to go outside to see it so I'll just watch your stream instead
[10:35:17] <Satin> i hadn't seen the literature section
[10:35:27] <Satin> first thing i see is a soseki book getting me excited, lying flat instead of in its place
[10:35:30] <Satin> and it's The Gate by him
[10:35:34] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: cum in my mouth
[10:35:38] <MootPoot> Ok
[10:35:50] * MootPoot shoots rope
[10:35:53] <Satin> and then i read the preface by pico iyer which is drawing attention to the group vs individualism in japanese vs western culture
[10:36:06] * MootPoot misses and hits the neighbors dog
[10:36:10] <Satin> and it's a very intimate personal topic for me of interest and i'm just very excited about the book from then on again

[10:37:24] <MootPoot> I don't read fiction anymore
[10:37:26] <Satin> > Intimiacy is shown not by all you say to someone, but by what you don't say
[10:37:31] <MootPoot> Do light novels count?
[10:37:33] <Satin> and in the second pic of it
[10:37:38] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I love this kind of book introduction
[10:37:45] <MootPoot> Oh no
[10:37:55] <Satin> me too, i never knew of pico iyer's exisetnce prior but he seems pretty interesting as ewll
[10:37:57] <MootPoot> The English lit majors
[10:38:04] <Satin> LMAO shush
[10:38:16] <Satin> but that 2nd pic talking about
[10:38:25] <Satin> the way (traditional, idk about mdoern) japanese culture
[10:38:44] <Satin> of living with what you're given in a sense, managing all of those obligations
[10:38:47] <Satin> group setting
[10:38:56] <Satin> vs the american shape-your-own-destiny individualism
[10:39:02] <senti> ugh, I'm awake finally.
[10:39:04] <Satin> that's shit i subtly think about at the back of my mind all the time
[10:39:08] <senti> I feel like shit.
[10:39:15] <MootPoot> Tell me how my kitchen table is a great metaphor for the connection between Modern and Victorian lifestyles or something
[10:39:16] <Satin> stuff like this just immediatly pops in and appeals to me as a topic
[10:39:27] <Satin> same in Kokoro as well, even without an introduction or preface to tell me that
[10:39:27] <senti> Hi Satin and MootPoot!
[10:39:30] <Satin> I noticed those themes in there
[10:39:32] <MootPoot> senti: hai
[10:39:45] <senti> MootPoot: xD
[10:39:53] <senti> ugh, fuck hangovers.
[10:40:00] <Satin> the way sensei and the main character/narrator are living their lives, their values and so on, worldivews, assumptions
[10:40:03] <Satin> hihi senti
[10:40:40] <senti> hihi Satin, much love it's been a while! I saw MootPoot a little while ago, but I haven't seen you in a while!
[10:40:45] <MootPoot> Tell me how the hangove movie was a allegory for modern mindsets Satin 
[10:40:46] <TsundereNoises> hi Senti
[10:40:55] <Satin> MootPoot: i have not watched the hangover movie
[10:40:58] <senti> Tsundere!
[10:41:11] <senti> TsundereNoises! Much love!
[10:41:11] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I have a couple non-fiction books about japanese lit that are pretty interesting
[10:41:13] <TsundereNoises> in that vein
[10:41:19] <Satin> MootPoot: and plenty of "good" movies don't have things that really talk about the human condition or have any interesting things to say about society, but are still good
[10:41:24] <MootPoot> TELL ME HOW ENGLISH IS THE SUPERIOR LANGUAGE TO ALL SATIN
[10:41:25] <Satin> I watched the Godfather for the first time recently
[10:41:37] <Satin> it's a splendid thing, cintemtagprophy and all though i'm a bad judge that doesn't watch much movies
[10:41:40] <Satin> same for uncut gems
[10:41:49] <MootPoot> I need a feminist critique of McDonald's
[10:41:56] <TsundereNoises> I think very few lit people have this kind of linguistic superiority complex
[10:41:56] <Satin> but anyone trying to write essays about them relating to some broader thing in society are a bit uh, stretching it
[10:42:04] <TsundereNoises> if you don't study other languages you miss allusions!
[10:42:07] <Satin> yes
[10:42:22] <Satin> there's no one good answer, but there's a beauty in both good translations
[10:42:28] <Satin> and original stuff as well
[10:42:32] <MootPoot> If you stick to one language you don't have any pain of learning more then one language
[10:42:35] <TsundereNoises> I love translator notes
[10:42:37] <MootPoot> 200iq
[10:42:51] <Satin> and of course there's all the stuff about how each language and stuff is so tied up with culture and that culture's philosophical concepts and so on
[10:43:00] <Satin> the germans ahve their own words for certain ideas and concepts
[10:43:22] <MootPoot> Victorian critique of women's masturbatory behaviour in pre-steam engine London
[10:43:29] <TsundereNoises> and English lurks in dark alleyways to beat up other languages and steal their vocab
[10:43:30] * Satin slaps MootPoot around
[10:43:34] <Satin> yeah
[10:44:09] <MootPoot> Satin: I need a critique of your slap and how it has deeper meanings in the 21st century then the 18th
[10:44:12] <Satin> i don't really like that English/american burger culture is as dominant as it is
[10:44:13] <Satin> but oh well
[10:44:30] <Satin> linga francas will always tend to exist in this sort of world i guess
[10:44:41] <Satin> MootPoot: baka
[10:44:46] <TsundereNoises> I mean there is a lot of bullshit literary analysis like that but there's also a lot of good to be had from trying to think about what you read/watch
[10:44:51] <Satin> ^
[10:44:56] <MootPoot> I will forever meme on literature people
[10:44:58] <Llamamoe> Okay what about this 
[10:45:02] <TsundereNoises> and many things DO have deeper meanings, sometimes beyond the conscious choice ofthe author
[10:45:03] <Satin> you will, and you're not a minority
[10:45:04] <MootPoot> Fuck you Mrs Smith
[10:45:08] <Satin> in fact you're the majority when you do that mootpoot
[10:45:13] <Llamamoe> If anyone can get me a remote job that I can actually manage to perform, I'll pay you 15% of my earnings 
[10:45:15] <Satin> so many people, on discord, even in real life and elsewhere
[10:45:19] <Satin> are so unreasonably cynical about art
[10:45:21] <Satin> or literature
[10:45:24] <Satin> or anything like that
[10:45:30] <MootPoot> Satin: art= tax fraud
[10:45:37] <Satin> and some of it is justified, pretentious people exist, and so on, and the ivory tower elitism
[10:45:45] <Llamamoe> Satin: Wait, seriously? I've always been like that, but never encountered anyone else who is 
[10:45:45] <Satin> but in other ways it's just lame that art has this corrupted meaning/understanding now
[10:45:52] <TsundereNoises> I'm a rebel, I love books
[10:45:53] <Satin> and all the serious stuff about it is gone
[10:45:58] <Satin> Llamamoe: no, that is the majority
[10:45:58] <Satin> now
[10:46:02] <Satin> it used to not be the case decades ago
[10:46:10] <Satin> when artists were given more prominence/attention/status
[10:46:15] <Llamamoe> In my experience, most people always automatically creamed over something being a classic 
[10:46:24] <Satin> even a few decades ago, Truman Capote, Al Gore Vidal
[10:46:24] <MootPoot> Llamamoe: they still do
[10:46:27] <Satin> and other american writers
[10:46:30] <Satin> had a lot of status
[10:46:35] <Satin> david foster wallace as well I guess?
[10:46:39] <MootPoot> Just now classic movies and shows and games
[10:46:40] <TsundereNoises> most people cream over something having great special effects and internet hype
[10:46:42] <MootPoot> Instead of books
[10:46:43] <Satin> but that's started to slip so badly
[10:46:48] <MootPoot> Cream
[10:46:51] <Satin> and it's corelated iwth drastic declines in readership
[10:46:54] <Satin> by studies
[10:47:00] <senti> Hi Llamamoe!
[10:47:01] <MootPoot> I used to read a lot as a kid
[10:47:08] <Satin> and it's a mixed bag for me, because on one level I don't want to come off as eltiist or pretentious
[10:47:19] <Llamamoe> Heya senti, long time no see :) 
[10:47:21] <Llamamoe> How you doing?
[10:47:24] <Satin> on the other hand i don't feel any shame in saying people suck for not reading as much as society might have before, and we need to get our priorities right
[10:47:35] <MootPoot> Boomer take
[10:47:36] <TsundereNoises> as I've gotten older I've realized that a certain amount of people will just assume I'm pretentious for liking things and I should just not give a shit
[10:47:36] <Satin> and consoom everything low effort and slap on it as art culture sucks
[10:47:39] <MootPoot>  /S
[10:47:41] <Llamamoe> Satin: It's not people who suck, it's the world, always the world
[10:47:46] <Satin> and superhero movies being this dominant and widespread is infantalie
[10:47:48] <Satin> infantile*
[10:47:56] <Llamamoe> People are merely a product of their genes and how the world shapes them 
[10:47:58] <senti> indeed! It's been a minute, Llamamoe. I'm happy to see you!
[10:48:05] <MootPoot> Don't work, they'll die eventually
[10:48:14] <Satin> that not everything and everyone's hobbies are equal
[10:48:15] <Satin> or worth it
[10:48:16] <Llamamoe> <3 senti
[10:48:25] <Satin> so i'm fundamentally a rude ass but w/e
[10:48:36] <senti> Llamamoe: I'm in a weird way where I can't tell if I like it better hot or cold.
[10:48:40] <TsundereNoises> also I like how people on both sides are offput that I love both classic literature and manga about japanese schoolgirls making out
[10:48:47] <Satin> lmaooooo
[10:48:50] <Satin> yeah
[10:49:02] <senti> so I have the A/C turned up, but I'm wearing a jacket and I've got the hood up.
[10:49:05] <MootPoot> Ok jokes aside, the problem with books now is the time commitment
[10:49:07] <Satin> there is nothing wrong with that, in my opinion as long as people are self aware
[10:49:15] <Satin> about the differences between "enjoyability" and "good writing"
[10:49:32] <Satin> it pains me when i see some people on discord talk about certain anime shows like they're wellw ritten stuff, or superhero lore as if it's ocmplex or whatever
[10:49:32] <Satin> just
[10:49:34] <Llamamoe> Satin: What you're not keeping in mind that more and more people suffer from mood disorders and attentional deficits, mostly due to sleep disordered breathing, insulin insensitivity, and other things beyond their control 
[10:49:37] <Satin> Bro
[10:49:38] <TsundereNoises> Yuri Kuma Arashi is a fucking masterpiece
[10:49:38] <senti> guess I'm an icy boi
[10:49:49] <Satin> Llamamoe: maybe :eyes
[10:49:51] * ButterNoodle farts on senti
[10:49:58] <TsundereNoises> not kidding btw
[10:49:59] * MootPoot farts
[10:50:02] <ButterNoodle> it was a beef stew
[10:50:08] <senti> ugh!! ButterNoodle!
[10:50:09] <Satin> is that an anime or manga?
[10:50:13] <Llamamoe> Satin: And that people are increasingly being eroded by the overwhelming prevalence of skinner boxes, 99% of applied psychology in this world is just designing digital products that are as addictive and effective at conditioning people as possible 
[10:50:13] <ButterNoodle> *kinda chunky
[10:50:19] <TsundereNoises> Satin: both, although anime is better imo
[10:50:19] <Satin> NGE, Ergo Proxy and a few others are up there
[10:50:22] <TsundereNoises> which is rare
[10:50:25] <Satin> Llamamoe: i can agree with that
[10:50:31] <MootPoot> Llamamoe: that's my job lmao
[10:50:33] <Satin> TsundereNoises: interesting, will keep that in mind thank you!
[10:50:36] <Llamamoe> MootPoot: :| 
[10:50:39] <Satin> MootPoot: LOL
[10:50:50] <Llamamoe> That is one of the jobs that I consider to cross the line of being ethical 
[10:50:53] <TsundereNoises> Satin: it's about a world where all humans live inside walled cities hiding from bears who want to eat them and ostracizing each other
[10:51:04] * senti fist bumps ButterNoodle (even though he just farted on me)
[10:51:11] <Llamamoe> But I do not judge you because this world is fucked up. In capitalism people have no choice but to do what they need to to survive 
[10:51:17] <TsundereNoises> also the bears eating people is innuendo that works in japanese too
[10:51:18] <Llamamoe> The incentive systems surrounding civilization are fucked up 
[10:51:23] <MootPoot> Satin: tbh some games do have good writing
[10:51:36] <MootPoot> By good as in good for a book as wekk
[10:51:42] <MootPoot> But very few
[10:51:53] <MootPoot> Most games have trash stories
[10:52:16] <Llamamoe> Honestly, good games that tell stories in a manner that actually integrates with gameplay mechanics are vastly more than what books could ever be 
[10:52:20] <Satin> MootPoot: i'm overassuming because I haven't even graduated school yet and who knows if i'll survive the CS program at this school once I bounce back and treat my PTSD but......... that's one of the things that's bothering me intensely lately, i don't wanna contribute to big tech or the same things that i'm absolutely opposed to in ideals
[10:52:21] * MootPoot tried to remember
[10:52:23] <TsundereNoises> I like when things go for both trashy and artsy at the same time
[10:52:27] <Llamamoe> Undertale, Pyre, Disco Elysium, <3
[10:52:55] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: gotta jerk off your chin chin and kokoro at the same time 
[10:52:58] <Llamamoe> Okay I'm tuning out of chat to try to get something done. PM me if you wish. 
[10:53:02] <Satin> and yet i don't know where to go tbh, use a CS degree and get into biocomputing/bioinformatics? use a CS degree and try to learn law stuff without becoming a lawyer and start writing things to influence public policy? no idea

[10:56:09] <MootPoot> Satin: satin for congresswoman?
[10:56:12] <Satin> TsundereNoises: for sure, but I guess a lot of the "richness" comes from the fact that for various reasons, lots of philosophers etc have used them
[10:56:13] <Satin> and
[10:56:21] <Satin> they're a rich method of studyign culture?
[10:56:28] <Satin> I don't know how well mythologies stand on their very own self
[10:56:37] <Satin> except for stuff like the illiad ahd oddessy
[10:56:41] <Satin> which use those characteers
[10:56:43] <TsundereNoises> depends on the writer!
[10:56:48] * Satin hasn't read very much mythology yet either
[10:56:51] <Guest57> You have the old greek tragedies.
[10:57:00] <TsundereNoises> and I'd argue the oddessy etc. are just straight up mythology at this point
[10:57:01] <Satin> i guess i'm obviously talking mainly about the greeks and romans here
[10:57:08] <Satin> and not including various other culture mythologyies that are rich
[10:57:14] <Satin> and influence society in a way fanfics don't
[10:57:18] <TsundereNoises> greek fanfic
[10:57:19] <Satin> indian gods etc
[10:57:22] <Satin> LOL
[10:57:24] <Satin> gree kfanfic
[10:57:26] <Guest57> That seems like the tried and true formula when it comes to storytelling, countless variations used even today.
[10:57:50] <TsundereNoises> I don't read much today about people destined by the gods to fuck their parents
[10:58:00] <TsundereNoises> we might have a richer culture if that were true I guess

[11:00:35] <Guest57> Zeus probably did most if not all the tags in your typical online smut galleries.

[11:01:53] <TsundereNoises> "daddyboris" is a tag
[11:02:09] <Satin> *dies*
[11:02:14] <Satin> God no
[11:04:12] <MootPoot> They should replace English literature with mandatory political science in schools

[11:04:21] <MootPoot> At least that's useful

[11:04:31] <MootPoot> For internet arguments
[11:04:40] <ButterNoodle> dont forget "human cattle" is a tag too
[11:04:43] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: did you not have to take civics?
[11:05:12] *** Joins: hans (~hans@36.84-48-255.nextgentel.com)
[11:05:21] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: in middle school
[11:05:22] <TsundereNoises> I was really disappointed that "Hardcore Gay Handholding" or something like that on AO3 just redirected to "handholding"
[11:05:23] <Satin> political science won't help people necessarily become wiser about their worldviews, though it would certainly aid in realizing the system they live in versus other systems, and help them become more self aware
[11:05:30] <Guest57> How about school curriculum engaging student critical thinking at best?
[11:05:38] <Satin> they'll have to learn all sorts of things that don't feel useful to them about analyzing political thought and so on
[11:05:38] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: wouldn't the most American place in Japan be アメリカ村　in 大阪?
[11:06:01] <Satin> and at a "higher level" many subjects are intertwined with each other
[11:06:16] <Satin> Fedor Dovkestky's novels, which are english lit material, are political and philosophical as well
[11:06:23] <Satin> for example
[11:06:24] <TsundereNoises> Satin, MootPoot: in high school civics, we got assigned positions to argue from things they couldn't agree about at the constitutional convention and had to debate them
[11:06:25] *** Quits: senti (~sentionic@161.129.70.186) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[11:06:26] <Satin> and so on and so forth
[11:06:29] <TsundereNoises> it was honestly really helpful
[11:06:34] <Satin> anthropology, sociology, philosophy, literature
[11:06:37] <Satin> political science
[11:06:41] <Guest57> Funny that, why do colleges or universities still require students to study their own languages?
[11:06:44] <Satin> the differences melt at higher levels
[11:07:01] <Satin> Guest57: what do you mean, english literature is not studying the english language per say directly
[11:07:03] <MootPoot> Guest57: because a lot just can't even do their own
[11:07:04] <Satin> TsundereNoises: yeah that's nice
[11:07:12] <Satin> per se*
[11:07:14] <Guest57> Didn't they already hammer common language at the start?
[11:07:32] <TsundereNoises> although you learn a lot about your own language when trying to study another
[11:07:43] <Guest57> MootPoot True.
[11:07:58] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I don't know, do you get an 8 hotdog breakfast with free dorink in Osaka?
[11:08:24] <Satin> Guest57: what are you referencing specifically? in most undergrad american degrees, there is English composition 1 and 2, to make sure you're ready for college writing, because american K12 schools are not evenly good here, so college courses compensate for that (these are also AP classes highschool students can take in advance)
[11:08:40] <Guest57> I does strike me a bit irksome that people talk in : 'AF' 'O-M-GEEE'
[11:08:42] <Satin> then there is humanities requirements, some of which can include options for english literature to fulfil, among other choices
[11:08:48] <TsundereNoises> also most people (including college kids) can't write for shit
[11:08:52] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: unlikely :(
[11:08:52] <Satin> and then finally there is of course, english literature degrees themselves
[11:09:33] <TsundereNoises> a lot of writing isn't about grammar though
[11:09:37] <Satin> (though plenty of other degrees have writing part and parcel as part of their assignments, including political science)
[11:09:38] <Satin> yes
[11:09:50] <MootPoot> Satin: touch bonfire to get humanity
[11:09:50] <Satin> a long time ago, around 2017 (not a long time ago)
[11:09:50] <Guest57> Ah yes. Art Majors.
[11:10:06] <Satin> Guest57: art majors are great, odn't talk shit about them /s
[11:10:22] <Satin> i kept trying to tell myself before i got into college that i wanted to prepare for college english by learning about grammar and syntax rules etc
[11:10:26] <ButterNoodle> major is sexi
[11:10:30] <Satin> so i tried to google textbooks for english grammar rules and so on
[11:10:32] <MootPoot> Can we make all the art majors into apt majors 
[11:10:40] <Guest57> TsundereNoises well as long as you get the point across without any deviation from the source.
[11:10:40] <Satin> and i kind of just eh kind of failed idk
[11:10:45] <TsundereNoises> Satin: Strunk and White, it's like 90 pages
[11:11:04] <Guest57> Satin Striking a nerve? Experience?
[11:11:04] <Satin> yes that exists, i saw that name pop up here and there but i'm afraid it's sort of outdated in some respects too from what i understand

[11:11:08] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: (74 / 269) <bagelsan> T​sundereNoises, i ignored you and im going to let everyone know daily multiple times that i have done so. just letting you know.
[11:11:16] <Satin> anyways then when i got to college, and actually started writing
[11:11:18] <MootPoot> !quote Satin 
[11:11:19] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: (48 / 62) <S​atin> OERIAS: why do i only remember you being gay
[11:11:32] <Satin> i realized i could semi-pass english 1 grammar test, and not get very good marks on it
[11:11:32] <TsundereNoises> Satin: a few things are overly persnickety but it's not half as bad as some stuff
[11:11:35] <Satin> but i would get As on my essays
[11:11:59] <Satin> and i understood from then on that good writing and english and stuff doesn't necessarily involve being an expert or even understanding grammar and syntax very well
[11:12:04] <Satin> gramamar rules*
[11:12:07] <Satin> versus being familiar
[11:12:11] <TsundereNoises> yeah
[11:12:18] <TsundereNoises> although bad grammar sticks out
[11:12:23] <TsundereNoises> most people can't put their finger on why
[11:12:28] <Satin> I won't necessarily pass an exam involving questions about adjectives and verbs and what not, like in theory
[11:12:29] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: I'm gonna grind my beans 
[11:12:40] <Satin> but I know how to write relatively alright because I've been reading newspapers and what not my whole life
[11:12:43] <TsundereNoises> I actually think the best way to learn that is to study a different language, and then try explaining English to a non-native speaker
[11:13:00] <Satin> and a lot of people don't get that i think
[11:13:00] <MootPoot> Adjectives are additional objectives.. besides the point
[11:13:08] <Satin> that's it's about familiarity and what not
[11:13:13] <Satin> "read a lot"
[11:13:20] <TsundereNoises> yes
[11:13:36] <Guest57> You know vocational work isn't bad unlike all people seem to make it.
[11:13:41] <Satin> and become aware of the styles, manner of speech (college and even cultural communication involves specific culture, mannerisms and writings no one will talk about)
[11:13:52] <TsundereNoises> Satin: by the way, I can be your control group if you want, maybe it'd motivate me, I fall off the Japanese study wagon all the time whenever I get depressed
[11:13:56] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises, this is a picture of アメリカ村 in 　大阪
[11:13:58] <isekai-kujira> You need to have an actual motivation for learning that language. One that is not just “I want to know that language”.
[11:13:59] <Satin> (to get your point across and look more tidy, and that's not a bad thing, that's just how it is)
[11:14:10] <Satin> TsundereNoises: lol
[11:14:20] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: does it look American?
[11:14:37] <amigojapan> That may be uncle Sam
[11:14:38] <TsundereNoises> isekai-kujira: I have lots of motivation, I also just have lots of stress, self-loathing, and despair
[11:14:41] <Guest57> amigojapan Is this a pen?
[11:14:42] <TsundereNoises> unrelatedly
[11:14:50] <Satin> Guest57: "Striking a nerve? Experience?" <--- no, you're not striking any nerves. It's just very common mass/popular culture understanding of art majors
[11:14:50] *** isekai-kujira is now known as isekaijin

[11:15:07] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot I just upgraded that vm to 11
[11:15:13] <Satin> so I'm annoyed, but I coexist with it, you haven't struck any nerves :3
[11:15:16] <ButterNoodle> 9->10 then 10->11
[11:15:23] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yeah, looks like home to me
[11:16:04] <TsundereNoises> I'm kind of annoyed at isekai-kujira just coming in out of nowhere to tell me I'm a failure because I'm not motivated
[11:16:11] <isekaijin> Wait.
[11:16:20] <Satin> lol
[11:16:22] <isekaijin> I was not criticizing you or anything.
[11:16:35] <TsundereNoises> I'm more motivated than a lot of people that do better than me
[11:16:35] <Satin> I think tsundere is half-joking about that isekajin
[11:16:44] <isekaijin> TsundereNoises: It was a reply to Satin 's “read a lot”.
[11:16:46] <TsundereNoises> my life is just kind of a constant line of stress and failure for the past 2 years
[11:16:47] <Satin> it felt like that to him but at the same time he doesn't mean you were literally saying that
[11:17:00] <TsundereNoises> I am half joking
[11:17:00] <isekaijin> Apologies if you interpreted it as criticism of you.
[11:17:04] <TsundereNoises> but it did come across as harsh
[11:17:09] <MootPoot> Satin: speaking for myself, I didn't start with a dislike for arts at least. It grew on  me with the people I met

[11:18:06] * TsundereNoises turns up the emo music, sips some absinthe
[11:18:12] <Guest57> Satin It does ring a bit true, no matter how you deny it. Most do not become end up being 'authors' or similar after they graduated.
[11:18:35] <Satin> Guest57: and that is okay, art majors don't have the standard set of expectations that other majors or degrees might have
[11:18:40] <TsundereNoises> I actually wish there was more mandatory writing (or harsher grading)
[11:18:43] <Satin> you can have very personal reasons to have a degree in those fields
[11:18:50] <TsundereNoises> lots of people get graduate degrees and STILL write like shit
[11:19:01] <Satin> not all degrees are about producing wage slaves or people who make a lot of money or are succesful
[11:19:03] <Guest57> TsundereNoises You can blame the lowering of standards for that.

[11:27:54] <Satin> and taking 30 shots to find something to instagram for everything in their life
[11:27:56] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I mean it's another thing I hear a lot and yet I still after a couple years have no clue what the fuck is really meant by it to the point I'm not sure anyone really knows
[11:27:57] <Satin> and influencers
[11:28:01] * ButterNoodle pulls himself around the floor by his arms dragging is ass on the carpet
[11:28:01] <Satin> but by jove is that another topic altogether
[11:28:23] * TsundereNoises duckface
[11:28:29] *** Joins: senti (~sentionic@161.129.70.145)
[11:28:30] * ImoutoBot welcomes s​enti (1 / 5): <s​enti> remember, wherever you are. You have a bad time. THE S​ENTI IS WITH YOU
[11:28:32] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: the anydesk rigup works like a charm - problem is its a bit laggy since it works over the internet - I'm going to have to figure out how to do that local networking thing after all
[11:28:34] <Satin> TsundereNoises: there is no exact definition, but people who hang out on places like discord, follow "influencers" on social media platforms, watch specific types of content on people, are into fashion and such will know
[11:28:40] <Satin> and twitch streamers as well
[11:28:54] <Guest57> Also, most dogs are pretty coddled nowadays. Hell, you even have breeds that don't even have much application other than another mouth to feed in your household.
[11:29:02] <Satin> it's intertwined with gen z, and a cute pokerface pink/hyper girly color aesthetic and so on
[11:29:05] <MootPoot> At some point I want to get coffee with Satin irl but I feel like she'll just keep roasting me
[11:29:08] <MootPoot> in person
[11:29:10] <Satin> nah
[11:29:11] <Guest57> Tell me, what can a chihuahua do that any old dog can and much more?
[11:29:13] <Satin> i'm boring as fuck in person
[11:29:16] <Satin> well not as fuck
[11:29:20] <Satin> but i'm passive and chill
[11:29:26] <Satin> or i used to be told that i was before i got shot
[11:29:26] <MootPoot> vegetable person
[11:29:31] <ButterNoodle> I love fucking
[11:29:32] <ButterNoodle> tbh
[11:29:34] <Satin> I don't know how I am to hang out with anymore but I assume i'm about the same lol
[11:29:43] <Satin> i just know i'm a bit more uppity at times
[11:29:45] <TsundereNoises> I'm worried that if I ever met any of you irl I'd be too nice and you'd think I was an imposter
[11:29:53] <Guest57> Satin It does make me curious when people introduce themselves that way
[11:29:58] <Satin> wdym?

[11:30:02] <Satin> introduce what way
[11:30:04] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: naaa I see right through that

[11:31:25] <Satin> Guest57: well, obviously it depends on the personality of the person, but  my guess is people like me are unsure of how to present themselves entirely. I'm not overtly self-confident like some people are, and in your face, and ready to go and what not, but at the same time I'm not entirely dismissive of myself either. I'm just me.
[11:31:26] <MootPoot> !seen billyzane
[11:31:26] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: billyzane was last seen in ##anime 27 days and 23 hours ago: <BillyZane> JesseDesu, you know what i want? an electric plane
[11:31:44] <MootPoot> thank you TsundereNoises , I used full moot and poot power to come up with that
[11:31:53] <Satin> And then on another separate front, I say chill because that's how some friends described me before, as a very calm chill person who didn't act hastily or overreact 
[11:31:56] <TsundereNoises> maximum pootage
[11:31:59] <Guest57> Satin So in short, you're unsure but you want to test the waters so you inherently put yourself out there?
[11:32:20] <Satin> yeah, I'm not even completely sure what sort of person I come off as, but I know it's not someone who's aggressive or anything
[11:32:25] *** Quits: sentionics (~sentionic@161.129.70.166) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[11:32:51] <Satin> also no @ "inherently put yourself out there"
[11:33:11] <MootPoot> I think I would get my act together if I got a gf
[11:33:18] <MootPoot> be constantly worried about driving her off
[11:33:37] <Satin> i don't like talking about this too much because it comes off as navel gazing, and I'm afraid of describing myself in ways that exaggerate it but eh
[11:33:45] <Guest57> Satin And that's fine. But I do feel like having someone describe themselves in that sort of way sort or lessens the appeal since you allow yourself to be cajoled by a label, instead of just having the person themselves form an opinion of you.
[11:33:51] *** Quits: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[11:33:56] <MootPoot> navel gazing Satin ? Damn, I'm into bellybuttons too
[11:34:11] <Satin> Guest57: welcome to not having very strong self confidence about such things
[11:34:20] <Guest57> MootPoot Piercings or none?
[11:34:23] <MootPoot> none
[11:34:27] <Satin> in a way i do that with the fear that people will overrate me
[11:34:30] <Guest57> Shame
[11:34:41] <MootPoot> the way I got over my social anxiety and talking to people in person is by dehumanizing them in my mind
[11:34:43] <Satin> it's better to make people have low expectations first
[11:34:47] <MootPoot> bad solution, but it works
[11:34:48] <Satin> and then maybe exceed them perhaps
[11:34:51] <Satin> than the other way around?
[11:35:01] <Satin> I don't have any defense of it, it's just how i naturally am.
[11:35:12] <Guest57> MootPoot Ah the good ol' reliable tribal mentality. The us vs them mindset.
[11:35:27] <MootPoot> Guest57: well its not us vs them, its me vs everyone
[11:35:42] <Guest57> MootPoot Misanthropy then?
[11:35:49] <Satin> my social anxiety worked differently. I assumed from homeschooling and all that i was just really bad at social interaction and what not, and having an accent, from growing up partly in another country et
[11:35:50] <Satin> c
[11:35:51] <MootPoot> its not hate or anything
[11:35:53] <Guest57> Or just a rebellious?
[11:35:58] <MootPoot> its just like
[11:36:02] <MootPoot> apathy
[11:36:12] <Satin> and then over time, exposure helped, and i realize people actually liked or enjoyed talking to me, aside from the fact i never started conversations at community college
[11:36:24] <MootPoot> if I saw a person in pain I would genuinely not care unless I took the time to interact with them for a while
[11:36:49] <MootPoot> Unregistered_object kind of 'them'
[11:36:57] <Guest57> Satin Everything requires some form of practice in order to be good at it. Though some people have inherent talent that makes them quite proficient with their own fields and interests, it doesn't mean you can't improve.
[11:37:00] <Satin> and when i worked at chic fil A last year, most people seemed to like me, and one even said stupid things like "I can tell you're intelligent, you just sound like it when you talk about things" (far from it lol)
[11:37:05] <Satin> but that just helps lol
[11:37:36] <Guest57> MootPoot Quoted like a true millenial. Apathy seems to be the spirit of the digitalized age.
[11:37:42] <Satin> zoomer*
[11:37:43] <MootPoot> what
[11:37:44] <Satin> not millenial tyvm
[11:37:48] <MootPoot> ^
[11:37:57] <Satin> Guest57: u soound like a millenial smh
[11:38:06] <Satin> or gen x
[11:38:08] <Guest57> Okay, zoomer.
[11:38:12] <Satin> :D
[11:38:17] <Satin> Guest57: also yeah for sure, at this point it's not an issue for me. I'm 22 now and far from worrying about things like
[11:38:21] <MootPoot> millenials are the people who hold onto boomer values and mindsets 
[11:38:30] <Satin> I'm more concerned about personal meaning, I'm fine with the social interactions i have
[11:38:39] <Satin> and i enjoy my close friends whenever we do hang out
[11:38:46] <MootPoot> :\
[11:38:56] <MootPoot> my friends are ##anime
[11:38:58] <MootPoot> basically
[11:38:59] <TsundereNoises> I feel like our obsession with generation labels was really exacerbated by the rise of clickbait
[11:39:00] <MootPoot> not even joking
[11:39:01] <Satin> that's okay too
[11:39:06] <Guest57> Seems like you feel like you're missing something. That or you're not telling the whole picture
[11:39:14] <Satin> what would i be missing?
[11:39:17] <MootPoot> I dont know a single other person in my city that I would meet for non-work reasons
[11:39:19] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: you nerds are a big part of my social interaction
[11:39:21] <MootPoot> Satin: I'm jelly
[11:39:51] <Satin> if i wasn't clear - I don't have that many friends or social interactions, but I'm perfectly fine with the ones I do have, and I do have close friends that we have hangouts with etc
[11:40:10] <Guest57> TsundereNoises You could blame the children or the 'normie' masses when it comes to the gullibility on things like clickbait.
[11:40:12] <Satin> and I'm content in a way I used to not be prior, is what I'm saying. it doesn't feel wrong or like something's missing
[11:40:57] <MootPoot> I want breast milk coffee
[11:41:00] <TsundereNoises> Guest57: I mean, in a way clickbait is as old as print, I just blame media companies
[11:41:04] <Satin> damm i just realized my linux installation is 1hr ahead of mountain time
[11:41:07] <Guest57> Satin I see, I was going to say that you don't seem fully content with how things are going with you personally.
[11:41:37] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: coffee with oppai juice in it, or like genetically engineered women who lactate coffee milk?
[11:41:39] <MootPoot> last time I felt content was when I singlehandedly devoured 14 chicken drumsticks
[11:41:47] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: second
[11:41:50] <Satin> Guest57: no I'm not "fully content" with how things are, I'm a gunshot victim from being attacked by carjackers last year, I am dealing with untreated PTSD and withdrew from classes
[11:41:52] <MootPoot> or first
[11:41:54] <Guest57> TsundereNoises Personally, it's like running a con-. You can't run without having a victim or a schmuck.
[11:41:55] <MootPoot> either one
[11:42:07] <Satin> but none of that has anything to do with the topic we were discussing - social life/social interactions
[11:42:08] <MootPoot> legit at some point I want to taste breast milk
[11:42:19] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: what is titty milk like
[11:42:30] <Satin> in that realm I'm content, or at the very least comfortable :)
[11:42:43] <MootPoot> I'm in a bad comfortable
[11:42:47] <MootPoot> comfortable, but not content
[11:42:54] <MootPoot> or comfortable but not satisfied
[11:43:03] <Satin> lol
[11:43:07] <Guest57> Satin I see. Sorry about that, but considering that I never knew jack and you just put it on the table suddenly. There's not a lot of conversation options for the me engage in.
[11:43:22] <MootPoot> I'm in a sexless dead marriage with myself
[11:43:23] <Satin> time to aggressively change that pooters, once you get your job nailed down

[11:43:40] <MootPoot> too ugly for tinder
[11:43:46] <Guest57> *Jeopardy music plays and a few conversation options pop-up*
[11:43:48] <MootPoot> dont know any people to leverage to make friends
[11:44:03] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: you've gotta communicate with yourself that you want to masturbate more, try to work on yourself, and if nothing else works just saw the hand off and be done with it
[11:44:03] <MootPoot> dont know anyone from my uni days
[11:44:05] <MootPoot> how the fuck
[11:44:06] <Satin> Guest57: oh yeah, no worries. As I said earlier, I hate topics like these because of the navel gazing aspect etc, but yeah
[11:44:11] <beaky> akirose has a nice body
[11:44:11] <TsundereNoises> there's lots of onaholes in the see
[11:44:12] <TsundereNoises> sea
[11:44:21] <Bco1981> beaky: she does
[11:44:28] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: I keep all of my onaholes in my gun safe
[11:44:35] <Satin> MootPoot: none of the following is not-hypocritical and it's more "do as i say not unto as i do" but
[11:45:01] <TsundereNoises> not unto as I do?
[11:45:18] <Satin> MootPoot: once you get more money and a stable job and career you can start working on selfcare, you can start balancing things (if you have the energy and motivation to care about it) like socially desirable things like going to the gym, skincare, appearences, fashion whatever
[11:45:41] <MootPoot> I can somewhat do all of those things but like
[11:45:42] <MootPoot> problem is
[11:45:45] <Guest57> Methinks of an old meme stating "Just do it!"
[11:45:46] <MootPoot> they dont lead to a social life
[11:45:52] <Satin> you can then, once again, if you have the energy, start doing things local to your area. iirc you live in a city, it's not impossible though it's difficult to find clubs and social settings. maybe start attending tech conventions
[11:45:57] <Satin> go to events with your coworkers
[11:46:08] <MootPoot> my entire department is remote
[11:46:09] <MootPoot> lol
[11:46:10] <Satin> MootPoot: they're pre-requisutes for most people who desire what you desire
[11:46:14] <Satin> MootPoot: LOL
[11:46:23] <MootPoot> I work at a company of 120k people
[11:46:33] <MootPoot> the entire department is remote, as is all other IT workers
[11:46:43] <Satin> they don't directly lead to a social life, but you're interested in dating and making new friends, and as sad as it is, people often judge at first impressions *and then* work on deeper connections
[11:46:49] <Guest57> MootPoot Hello, fellow corporate drone.
[11:46:52] <Satin> so they do help with the first impressions bit quite a bit
[11:47:00] <MootPoot> hello drone 57 
[11:47:23] <Satin> MootPoot: smh did you choose a remote job because it fit into your currently passive lifestyle
[11:47:34] <Satin> or because of the job finding struggle you mentioned earlier this year
[11:47:39] <MootPoot> I've held 2 full time dev jobs
[11:47:41] <MootPoot> so far
[11:47:46] <Satin> were they both remote
[11:47:51] <Guest57> Satin Let him do what he wants with his life.
[11:47:52] <MootPoot> both were offered to me and I took them - first ones I got
[11:47:54] <MootPoot> and both were remote
[11:48:04] * MootPoot shrugs
[11:48:07] <Satin> Guest57: I didn't say he couldn't - but he's the one asking "how"
[11:48:09] <MootPoot> only option I got
[11:48:29] <MootPoot> although I am getting offers for hybrid work places
[11:48:31] <MootPoot> so lets see
[11:48:35] <Satin> if he wants y, knowing what some of the x's might be isn't a bad thing, or at least, suggestions
[11:48:47] <Guest57> Well considering how much of a trash-heap the current economics are. If you have a job, that's good enough.
[11:48:52] <MootPoot> Satin: most of the women I know and I'm on good terms with are married 30-40 year olds with kids
[11:48:53] <Satin> MootPoot: do you prefer remote or in person?
[11:49:00] <Satin> MootPoot: hahhahsthsh
[11:49:10] <MootPoot> :/
[11:49:12] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I mean, you like MILFS right?
[11:49:17] <Satin> ara ara
[11:49:18] <Satin> jk
[11:49:19] <MootPoot> yes but I dont like NTR
[11:49:25] <TsundereNoises> Satin: no, NOT JKs
[11:49:30] <Satin> omg
[11:49:33] <TsundereNoises> JKs are too young
[11:49:33] <MootPoot> and also I dont like milfs - I like OLs and onee-sans
[11:49:37] <TsundereNoises> for MootPoot
[11:49:42] <Guest57> Satin Maybe remote for simping, and the in-person one for the shallow empty sex.
[11:49:43] <Satin> yeah everytime people make jokes about JKs it creeps me out
[11:49:43] <Satin> smh
[11:49:53] <MootPoot> satin is a jk
[11:49:57] <MootPoot> makes sense

[11:50:11] <TsundereNoises> that seems impossible
[11:50:24] <MootPoot> Actually
[11:50:25] <Satin> Guest57: well I obviously wouldn't advocate for a lifestyle like that with my values, but in my opinion remote simping is very shallow and the return on it is very lame lol
[11:50:27] <MootPoot> I just realzied something
[11:50:28] <MootPoot> Satin: 
[11:50:29] <MootPoot> Satin: 
[11:50:41] <Satin> i'm not a guy so i don't know how it's like fully, but i sure hang around plenty of people on discord like that
[11:50:44] <Satin> including the eboys
[11:50:53] <MootPoot> My entire upbringing from family to teachers etc has all been older women
[11:50:59] <MootPoot> like literally 90% or more
[11:51:08] <MootPoot> maybe that has something to do with it
[11:51:18] <TsundereNoises> !quote urchin 9
[11:51:19] <ImoutoBot> TsundereNoises: (9 / 16) <Urchin> like the difference between "I want to fuck, jk" and "I want to fuck jk"
[11:51:30] <Guest57> Satin It's quite common, can't really say much about it that isn't already said in some youtuber's channel critiquing culture
[11:51:36] <Satin> MootPoot: but i'm being serious, as much as you might not believe it, even simple changes in lifestyle and mindset can go a long way
[11:51:41] <MootPoot> But also since I have so much young interaction with women I'm really used to the ways of the internal bullshit
[11:51:47] <MootPoot> of woman culture
[11:51:49] <MootPoot> so to speak
[11:51:52] <Guest57> TsundereNoises Unless that person's name is 'jk'
[11:51:53] <TsundereNoises> Satin: do eboys like pink?
[11:51:54] <Satin> instead of you being hung up over your lack of hits on tinder or bumble or whatever
[11:52:00] <Satin> TsundereNoises: some do
[11:52:04] <Satin> but femboys are more on there
[11:52:08] <Guest57> Maybe you're just into J K Rowling.
[11:52:20] <Satin> Guest57: you aren't getting the JK joke are you
[11:52:20] <MootPoot> first time I heard femboys I thought it was some kind of S&M thing
[11:52:39] <TsundereNoises> Satin: yeah but I know what a femboy is, I wish more terms were intuitive like that
[11:52:41] <Satin> MootPoot: LOL
[11:52:48] <Guest57> Satin I get it, but I want to spice it up a bit.
[11:52:51] <TsundereNoises> I just don't know if eboys are like new fratboys or not
[11:52:59] <Satin> no
[11:53:04] <Satin> also "softboys"
[11:53:05] <Satin> ROFL
[11:53:09] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: the train stations in my line are numbered as JK-1 JK-2 and so on...
[11:53:10] <MootPoot> There are femboys, fratboys, and me in the last category - fatboys
[11:53:11] <Satin> oh god i hate zoomer culture sometimes
[11:53:23] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: lot of high schools around there huh?
[11:53:28] <Satin> bts stanning soft boys? sksksksk
[11:53:34] <MootPoot> please
[11:53:35] <MootPoot> no
[11:53:37] <MootPoot> dont sk
[11:53:38] <Satin> LMFAO
[11:53:39] <Guest57> Speaking of "softboys" what about this new trend of men being andrgynous-looking?
[11:53:39] <TsundereNoises> wtf does that mean
[11:53:41] <Satin> oop-
[11:53:43] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: dont
[11:53:54] <TsundereNoises> STOP MAKING ME FEEL LIKE AN OLD
[11:54:12] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: it is short for Japan rail Keihintouhoku line
[11:54:15] <Satin> Guest57: gender norms are changing/different and younger people feel more alright with being sometimes andrynous
[11:54:28] <Satin> in impressions
[11:54:30] <Satin> or even feminine
[11:54:32] <TsundereNoises> are all the new trends people are mad about just trends from 15 years ago?
[11:54:32] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: but JKs do ride on it
[11:54:33] <Satin> i see no issue with it
[11:54:38] <Satin> traditional masculinity is often toxic
[11:54:53] <MootPoot> when somebody says sk I try to autocorrect it to sk hynix or sk sports and try to ignore it
[11:55:00] <Satin> skskssksk
[11:55:03] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I have a book about chainsaws I wish I could talk to you about
[11:55:19] <Satin> i think you can't just ignore traditional masculinty and it's upsides altogether though
[11:55:23] <Guest57> Sometimes when I watch the tv or curiously glancing at one of my relatives surfing the net. K-POP and the like where sometimes you can't even tell the gender.
[11:55:25] <Satin> men need cultural identity too
[11:55:32] <Satin> but you should definitely revise it and remove the bad bits
[11:55:33] <TsundereNoises> I read sk as short for "serial killer"
[11:55:35] <amigojapan> What's sk MootPoot ?
[11:55:40] <MootPoot> amigojapan: NO
[11:55:41] <MootPoot> DONT
[11:55:45] <amigojapan> Lol TsundereNoises 
[11:55:48] <Satin> Guest57: how old are you out of curiosity?
[11:55:55] <Satin> what you said made me chuckle slightly
[11:55:59] <Guest57> Mid-20's why?
[11:56:07] <Satin> oh was just curious
[11:56:28] <Satin> it's just that you talk about some of these things as if you've just woken up to them recently
[11:56:38] <Satin> and usually it's boomers who think that y'know

[12:01:48] <Satin> TsundereNoises: i cared up till 2020
[12:01:54] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I feel like that's not much to go off 
[12:01:56] <Satin> i guess i might ask you at some later date
[12:01:57] <Satin> yeah
[12:01:59] <Satin> it isn't

[12:02:05] <MootPoot> is Satin a futa with a tiny penis

[12:02:19] <MootPoot> but massive bals
[12:02:22] <Guest57> MootPoot You could say that to describe a girl sometimes.
[12:02:22] <Satin> i've had some nasty experiences with 4channers

[12:03:02] <MootPoot> slidin into your arse
[12:03:06] <Satin> but has a higher murder rate, in part because of St. Louis
[12:03:12] <Satin> one of america's murder capitals
[12:03:22] <Satin> or the murder capital of the country in some ways
[12:03:39] <TsundereNoises> does the rest of the state really do that well even when you take out St. Louis?
[12:03:39] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I have said I live in Kawaguchi many times, and there has been at least one user that have me death threats and he claims to have lived in Japan. I should be more careful
[12:03:49] <Guest57> Isn't it chicago or how some people refer it to "commie-fornia"?
[12:03:49] <TsundereNoises> I'd have assumed the whole state was more murdery than Norway on principle
[12:03:55] <Satin> Missouri is a pretty mid-tier state in quality of life, outside of St. Louis, is very chill and has affordoable living and what not
[12:04:08] <Satin> and Kansas City, a region where I'm from, is pretty nice
[12:04:09] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yeah but I mean you publish your name
[12:04:18] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: also I really think you're fine

[12:05:20] <TsundereNoises> are we sure Guest57 isn't someone's grandpa?
[12:05:29] <Satin> Guest57: my political ideology isn't bad to get leaked
[12:05:33] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: if he does it again while being in Japan. That is actually something the Japanese police arrest people for, death threats they the internet
[12:05:46] <Guest57> TsundereNoises How so?

[12:08:24] <MootPoot> Satin: join in for a 3 way where both of you can get canuck citizenships
[12:08:24] <Guest57> I would rather marry a polynesian for the tax-free havens they currently have.
[12:08:25] * MootPoot cums

[12:08:58] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: can I play with ur sigs
[12:09:00] <TsundereNoises> Oh say can you see, by the screen's early light, what so proudly we hailed, at the twilight's last gleaming, whose broad thighs and bright eyes though the perilous night, o'er the keyboards we watched, were so gallantly streaming.
[12:09:03] <ButterNoodle> *who wants to wear the antlers tonight?
[12:09:10] <TsundereNoises> our national song is about vtubers

[12:09:33] <Satin> for strong state culture
[12:09:44] <Satin> new mexico too
[12:09:51] <ButterNoodle> its not a neck beard anymore if it grows into ur dick beard
[12:09:55] <Satin> ig lousianas care but they're kind of weirdga
[12:10:02] <Satin> oops im using discord speak hehe
[12:10:03] <Satin> i meant weird
[12:10:11] <Guest57> Satin I don't know about california and new york but texas sounds like they have most of their policies down pat at least.
[12:10:24] <TsundereNoises> Satin: California is more like 3 different state cultures, it's not that homogeneous
[12:10:25] <Satin> if "down pat" means good, - agree to disagree
[12:10:33] <Satin> texas is a hellhole on the state politics level
[12:10:38] <Guest57> Satin How so?
[12:10:41] * MootPoot pepega's Satin 
[12:10:52] <ButterNoodle> yea louisiana is kinda like that cousin u use to laugh at and feed antifreeze when he was a kid.. now he's 25, on meth, and in kidney failure..

[12:10:59] <Satin> ButterNoodle: LOl
[12:11:05] <TsundereNoises> !seen senti
[12:11:05] <ImoutoBot> TsundereNoises: senti was last seen in ##anime 1 hour and 20 minutes ago: * senti fist bumps ButterNoodle (even though he just farted on me)
[12:11:13] <Guest57> ButterNoodle Sounds like a fun guy to know at parties.
[12:11:15] <TsundereNoises> still appropriate!
[12:11:29] <ButterNoodle> Guest57: yea lets play the "
[12:11:38] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle is the type of guy to show up at a party with a shoe full of cum
[12:11:38] <TsundereNoises> I can't believe how good his last comment fits with the current topic
[12:11:44] <Satin> Guest57: because their leadership is more obsessed with politics that divide people, and appealing to cultural social outrage politics than actual change
[12:11:44] <ButterNoodle> Guest57: yea lets play the "guess how many teef I have left" game
[12:11:57] <Guest57> MootPoot The sounds his shoe makes.
[12:12:04] <Satin> also the recent abortion stuff
[12:12:20] <MootPoot> I'm still 50/50 on abortion 
[12:12:20] <Satin> which was deemed unconstitutional i guess eventually or is still in the process
[12:12:30] <Satin> making texas women travel to lousiana abortion clinics
[12:12:33] <Satin> and what not
[12:12:35] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: u fluffed too early ma dood.. I show up with a cock full of cum... anyone want some fried chicken?
[12:12:36] <Satin> among many other things
[12:12:44] <Satin> like i said, the state politics is a hellhole
[12:12:53] <MootPoot> texus power grid memes
[12:13:05] <ButterNoodle> its kinda shit rn...
[12:13:13] <Satin> do they get away with the way they run things? absolutely. lots of money for now, and texas is relatively prosperous and what not
[12:13:20] <Guest57> Regarding on the ethical side of abortion, it's straight up murder. Regarding on the welfare side, it's straight up economic suicide.
[12:13:20] <ButterNoodle> I hope it self corrects by the time I have to move there
[12:13:22] <Satin> but political stability wise it's not calm or anything unlike in california
[12:13:27] <Satin> which is very one-sided

[12:14:07] <Satin> texas is turning into a battleground, and so all the worst part about american politics are rearing their ugly head on the state level is all i'm saying
[12:14:18] <ButterNoodle> yea idc about abortion.. just like every other social/political issue... if u want one, have one.. if u dont, don't.. otherwise fuck off
[12:14:22] <Satin> abbot is going to announce new outrageous policies that alienate anyone that isn't his most conservative base more
[12:14:30] <TsundereNoises> I wish we could have had the outrage about power grid that we do about some other issues
[12:14:38] <MootPoot> I'd be okay with abortion if we stopped doing this whole "its not REALLY a person" thing and just straight up say you're killing for your convinience in 95% of cases
[12:14:49] <MootPoot> just admit it
[12:14:51] <Satin> california has serious issues
[12:14:53] <Guest57> Satin Man, partisan politics. Triggering the old tribe mentality on-set for the modern times.
[12:14:54] <Satin> and hypocrisy issues
[12:15:11] <Satin> Guest57:  eh, maybe it's old tribe mentality but I don't look to such explanations often
[12:15:13] <Satin> personally at least
[12:15:29] <Guest57> "If you're not on this side you're against us". There's got to be something more than this.
[12:15:34] <Satin> and I think american politics would look a lot less retarded if money wasn't so involved and *yes i said it* american capitalism stuff
[12:15:35] <TsundereNoises> it's much more planned than that
[12:15:44] <MootPoot> I WILL FINISH AQUATOPE IF ITS THE LAST THING IM GONNA DO
[12:15:47] <Guest57> You can't individually pick out any policy anymore. You have to take sides.
[12:15:51] * MootPoot finishe
[12:15:51] <ButterNoodle> legal abortions mean less poverty
[12:15:53] <TsundereNoises> right after same-sex marriage was legalized, suddenly we had panics about trans people in bathrooms
[12:15:53] <ButterNoodle> its ez
[12:15:59] <TsundereNoises> wasn't an issues until a new wedge issue was needed
[12:16:02] <TsundereNoises> this shit happens all the time
[12:16:04] <Satin> Guest57: you know fundamentally speaking both sides are the same though, and politicans just get elected based on social outrage over very specific issues
[12:16:16] <TsundereNoises> Satin: also, I'm immediately regretting engaging in this conversation, I'm sorry
[12:16:19] <Satin> they're both, in political philosophy, considered neoliberal as well
[12:16:26] <Satin> TsundereNoises: lol i was trying to avoid this part of it but y'know
[12:16:32] <Satin> unavoidably
[12:16:42] <Satin> (i'm not wading into the abortion topic for a reason)
[12:16:49] <Guest57> ButterNoodle More of that juicy stem-cells people are going on a craze about.

[12:17:04] <ButterNoodle> are we doing stem cell shots?
[12:17:19] <ButterNoodle> like shitty whiskey?
[12:17:28] <Satin> Josh Hawley is so crazy though LOL
[12:17:30] <TsundereNoises> see, comments like that are why I wonder if this isn't a time-travelling elderly person from 2001 rather than a european
[12:17:34] <Guest57> Have a chaser near-by.
[12:17:49] <ButterNoodle> I chase my shots of stem cells with crack

[12:56:53] <Satin> gatekeeping and elitism good to a degree
[12:56:55] <DunceCotus> you can't have art without the expenditure
[12:57:02] <Satin> as long as what's been gatekept is quality of something
[12:57:10] <Satin> it's akin to toarvalds yelling on the mialing list
[12:57:11] <Bco1981> social media is for normies... you think we keep tabs on what goes on there ?
[12:57:16] <Satin> ok torvalds is a bad example

[12:59:23] <Satin> i'm just chuckling to myself rn that reacting with a reddit emoji in certain communities is an insult
[12:59:24] <DunceCotus> how do we define qualtiy
[12:59:27] <DunceCotus> *quality
[12:59:31] <DunceCotus> this is what I think art is about
[12:59:38] <DunceCotus> the definition of quality
[12:59:50] <Satin> I don't think so necessarily
[12:59:52] <DunceCotus> art is not about making us think or reflecting the world etc.
[13:00:00] <Guest57> DunceCotus Could be personal or inherent due to objectivity.
[13:00:00] <DunceCotus> art is about aesthetic concepts
[13:00:21] <Guest57> Beauty has a checklist of forms. And that is intrinsic to everything.
[13:00:22] <DunceCotus> Guest57: there is no subjective quality
[13:00:36] <DunceCotus> art is objectively quality
[13:00:54] <Guest57> Then what of pollock and abstract-art?
[13:01:05] <DunceCotus> those have their own aesthetic quality
[13:01:10] <Satin> why not? of course i can't claim some universal definition of art, but I can certainly claim that good art often makes one think, or offers a glimpse in what things good be, or explores some aspect of the human condition or a particular subject through a lens that other means cannot
[13:01:10] <DunceCotus> in relation to their production
[13:01:33] <DunceCotus> there is no human condition
[13:01:36] <Guest57> Then by your logic art becomes more related to their production and not by itself?
[13:01:47] <Satin> and by definition, not everything can be art. anything with visuals and imposing visuals is not art necessarily
[13:01:59] <Satin> pollock sucks
[13:02:20] <DunceCotus> Guest57: art both stands on its own and inseperable to its production
[13:02:25] <DunceCotus> think of our own existence
[13:02:33] <DunceCotus> we are inseparable from the processes that produce us
[13:02:39] <DunceCotus> but we are also individual, unique
[13:02:41] <Guest57> Satin what of picasso?
[13:02:51] <Satin> what about him? he's one of the great artists of the past
[13:03:01] <Satin> whose way of blowing up things, like the shoe painting, etc forgot his name
[13:03:18] <DunceCotus> when we look at a piece of art there is at least some consideration for its production
[13:03:24] <Satin> is one of the ways in which an artist expresses their viewpoint, gives us an opportunity to engage and explore what we might not otherwise
[13:03:27] <DunceCotus> that is to say sculpture is not the same as painting
[13:03:34] <DunceCotus> they are produced differently, different mediums etc.
[13:04:04] <DunceCotus> Satin: im not sure if artists express a viewpoint
[13:04:04] <Guest57> DunceCotus Consideration but not entirety. Meaning can be a mess to portray to an audience hence beauty can be called up to snuff due to it being more objective.
[13:04:10] <Satin> perhaps I should be clear what I'm arguing - I'm not arguing that they are not "art", but they're certainly not good art, or at the very least not art on the same level comparable to good art.
[13:04:21] <Satin> they certainly can express a viewpoint - they don't have to, but they certainly can
[13:04:24] <Satin> through their work
[13:04:25] <Satin> s
[13:04:52] <DunceCotus> art can be ugly too though
[13:04:54] <Satin> okay hold on i need to switch modes for this one (i'm not schizo i swear but i do have different modes) *switches to serious mode*
[13:05:17] <DunceCotus> Satin: well they can inject viewpoint into the art, but that's generally when it suffers and becomes like editorial
[13:05:23] <Guest57> Satin Could you at least tell us where the switches are located?
[13:05:32] <DunceCotus> art is better when it seems to have its own viewpoint divorced from artist intentions etc.
[13:06:03] <Guest57> DunceCotus That goes counter to your statement earlier being art not being subjective but objective.
[13:06:16] <DunceCotus> Guest57: how so?
[13:06:20] <Guest57> Also, expecting a wall of text.
[13:07:23] <Guest57> DunceCotus Viewpoint.
[13:07:30] * MootPoot waddles
[13:07:43] <Satin> So to be specific with what I'm arguing for - I'm arguing against very modern mass relativist definitions or understanding of art as it all being relative. And "art is subjective" being misused to call anything and everything good art. 
[13:07:43] <Satin> Young adult novels like Harry Potter and such can be certainly said to be "art" in some way, but they are by no means comparable to good art, such as those works from the Great Artists of the past, such as that of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Leo Tolstoy, Fedor Dovosty  and so on.
[13:07:51] <Guest57> See?
[13:08:11] <MootPoot> I'm getting eng lit vibes again
[13:08:23] <Guest57> Quick, get to book-burning.
[13:08:26] <DunceCotus> to say art is subjective is to say nothing at all
[13:08:34] <DunceCotus> everything is subjective
[13:08:39] <MootPoot> superiorty of the "old victorian or classics" 
[13:08:43] <MootPoot> bleh
[13:08:46] <Guest57> DunceCotus True.
[13:09:04] <DunceCotus> a viewpoint however is an insistence of an objective angle or position 
[13:09:33] <Guest57> But that's how it is. It has more to do with the intent, but knowing intent from a painting made by someone long dead has no discourse other than those that assume as well, no?
[13:09:37] <DunceCotus> the art can have its own viewpoint here I think that is not found in the artist or even in the audience
[13:09:46] <DunceCotus> it seems to exist outside of normal human considerations
[13:10:13] <Satin> Now, the matter of what Dunce seems to be centered on - such as specific details about "what is art" is not something that I wish to delve into too much. 
[13:10:15] <Satin> I believe that there exists art that both can contain specific viewpoints that are argued, and meaning that the artist did not intend. For example, a good piece of poetry might invoke in it feelings and richness and viewpoints and interpretitions that even the poet himself might have not originally intended.
[13:10:39] <Guest57> i agree.
[13:10:48] <Satin> It just depends, and it's part of the fun of exploring art works in their respective mediums, and on their own terms. Richness and interpretition.
[13:11:29] <DunceCotus> when an artist makes an artwork they are more like channelling
[13:11:34] <Guest57> At this point it just leads up to personal preference.
[13:11:42] <Satin> However, I also argue very strongly that you cannot just call anything art. There is often informed traditions, for example, the great novelists in Literature, the great poets in poetry, playrights and so on.
[13:11:48] <DunceCotus> if an artist is not channelling they are not making art?
[13:12:04] <Satin> It's not entirely about subjective viewpoints and what resonates with you.
[13:12:45] <DunceCotus> the difference is i think that the art does not have a human voice

[13:12:51] <Satin> Just because you could "relate" to that one black nonbinary character in an otherwise shitty novel, doesn't make it a rich exploration or a good piece of art, even if it was personally and authentically enjoyable to you.

[13:14:00] <DunceCotus> just that there is objective qualities and aesthetic concepts in all art
[13:14:28] <Satin> I think there is. I don't want to use the word "objective" because it bothers me, it has a philosophical meaning to it, and if you want to get into the brushes and details on that one, there is a lot of loaded language and assumptions with the word "objective" which I don't want to get entangled with.
[13:14:39] <Satin> I will instead say this - there explicitly is good and bad art in my opinion.
[13:14:48] <Bco1981> Satin: lets call it deviant art...

[13:15:21] <DunceCotus> Satin: how do you draw the line?
[13:15:21] <Guest57> Bco1981 Is deviantart still an active platform or has it already shifted to twitter?
[13:15:24] <Satin> The criteria of which I cannot distill in an IRC message, but can argue is evident often in the minds of people informed and educated in a certain medium.
[13:15:35] <Bco1981> Guest57: yeah it's active
[13:15:45] <Satin> In other words, it's something you, can argue for in an essay as with many other things in this world.
[13:15:46] <DunceCotus> Satin: if you are comparing art then sure
[13:15:55] <DunceCotus> however once you start to compare art it becomes more like a techne
[13:16:01] <DunceCotus> than art for its own sake
[13:16:06] <Satin> You can argue for Moby Dick being good and rich, and find new ways to discover William Blake's poetry as Harold bloom did
[13:16:15] <Satin> 100 years after moby dick was written and dismissed*
[13:16:21] <Satin> you can argue for those things
[13:16:35] <DunceCotus> art can be incredibly derivative and unoriginal and still be art
[13:16:41] <Satin> but to call all art just good is a disservice to art itself
[13:16:45] <DunceCotus> how? Well it invokes its own qualities, aesthetic concepts
[13:16:46] <Bco1981> Guest57: 3, 4 and 5 days ago there was activity on some of the stuff i did.

[13:20:18] <DunceCotus> Satin: it could be self-reflexive
[13:20:43] <Satin> dunce that does not make sense - using your definition/understanding of comparing, that would mean any critique of an art piece, or criticism of an art piece, banana taped to a wall or anything else........ is meaningless
[13:20:46] <Satin> and you must never criticize it
[13:21:04] <Satin> comparison is part and parcel of critiquing and evaluation

[13:22:29] <DunceCotus> to say it is NOT art, that would take more of an argument than this is shit I reckon
[13:22:32] <Satin> DunceCotus: I specifically said I'm going to shy away from using the word objective, but I did say that I have all reason in the world to dismiss it as being bad art, indeed.
[13:22:54] <Satin> yes, i addressed that earlier - for me it's not a matter of arguing over the semantics of if it's art or not
[13:23:08] <Satin> harry potter and other young adult trash are "art" in some ways for sure
[13:23:08] <DunceCotus> well its not about semantics
[13:23:18] <DunceCotus> Satin: why only in some ways?
[13:23:22] <Satin> but the question is about if it's good art, comparable to the past greats, or bad
[13:23:46] <Satin> eh, you can mentally erase the "some ways" if it bothers you in your mind
[13:23:48] <Satin> :p
[13:23:57] <DunceCotus> I think you may be referring to aesthetic richness
[13:24:00] <Satin> for the sake of argument, I will remove the some ways
[13:24:32] <Satin> and instead say "that too is art conceptually, but going by my terms, and my arguments, that is not good art, that is bad art"
[13:24:35] <DunceCotus> I think whether art is good/bad is neither here nor there
[13:24:40] <DunceCotus> but rather what does the art do
[13:24:57] <Satin> why can't the latter be part of that question?
[13:25:13] *** Quits: Mr_Misery (~weechat@8.20.101.205) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[13:25:18] <DunceCotus> Satin: because good/bad has specious objectivity
[13:25:39] <DunceCotus> and is more along the lines of art is subjective
[13:26:09] <DunceCotus> what art does however can be objectively determined
[13:26:12] <DunceCotus> at least partially
[13:26:23] <Satin> I don't know about "objectivity" once again, because that's too loaded a term for me to use (e.g. against which universal standard or philosophical system are we judging it against as objective)
[13:26:29] <DunceCotus> the great art of past centuries had objective effects on the world
[13:26:40] <Satin> but I can certainly argue that good/bad is part of human judgement
[13:26:52] <DunceCotus> perhaps less successful art can be considered 'bad' but we don't know what an art can do in advance
[13:27:17] <Satin> are you arguing against the idea of some things being better than others when it comes to art?
[13:27:35] <DunceCotus> Satin: I just think that for art it isn't relevant
[13:27:37] <Satin> That Herman melville's moby dick isn't better compared to harry potter?
[13:27:59] <DunceCotus> Satin: they do different things, play with different aesthetic concepts
[13:28:03] <DunceCotus> as such there is no point comparing them
[13:28:04] <Satin> I think it is very much relevant and has an influence on not only our judgement of an art piece on its own merits, but also shapes our own understanding of the world
[13:28:30] <MootPoot>  I want a gpu
[13:28:38] <Bco1981> for?
[13:28:42] <Bco1981> you already have one
[13:28:48] <MootPoot> NAS box
[13:28:53] <MootPoot> more powah
[13:28:54] <Satin> they might attempt to play with different aestehtic concepts, but they might also have many comparable qualities, for example, one might be more sophisticated in subject matter, stylistically be better, more immersive, more rich
[13:28:56] <MootPoot> etc
[13:29:02] <Bco1981> what does it need a gpu for ?
[13:29:23] <MootPoot> I was thinking about making it a game streaming box
[13:29:27] <MootPoot> as well
[13:29:27] <Bco1981> ah
[13:29:28] <MootPoot> maybe
[13:29:42] <Satin> the other might be inferiror in the quality and phrasing of prose, might be far more dull, its subject matter and plot, its characters, only entertaining to an easily entertained young teenager who knows nothing better
[13:29:51] <Satin> to compare it against
[13:30:04] <DunceCotus> Satin: but that's not about art, its about techne
[13:30:48] <DunceCotus> art is about what the art brings into the world of its own accord, doesn't necessarily depend on the technical prowess (though sometimes that can help)
[13:31:21] <Satin> no, the above details are part of the art when judged on its own merits
[13:31:41] <DunceCotus> when you are judging art you are not
[13:31:50] <Satin> it's part of the various parts, that taken as a whole, form your appreciation or consumption of that art
[13:32:08] <DunceCotus> what you are judging is technical prowess, entertainment value etc.
[13:32:28] <DunceCotus> those may be components of a work of art
[13:32:41] <DunceCotus> but they are not necessarily related to what an art does
[13:33:37] <Satin> they're part of the experience, of experiencing art, in my honest opinion. they're not only evident when broken down

[13:54:38] <Satin> no omg
[13:54:42] <Satin> i just have one account for school
[13:54:45] <Satin> and another normal one
[13:54:47] <Satin> and stuff like that
[13:54:58] <Satin> and discord demanded a phone number to verify one
[13:55:05] <Satin> and i forgot i had it associated with another one
[13:55:09] <Satin> and now the y locked me out of both -.-
[13:55:19] <Satin> and i can't ask other people to let me use their phone number

[13:59:27] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: discord gives you too much freedom (but also no freedom in weird spots)
[13:59:34] <DunceCotus> too much CONTENT

[14:00:11] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: no the internet is very striated right now
[14:00:14] <Satin> it does not win in being that trustable, having  a good privacy/terms of service policy, and moderation

[14:00:40] <Sadale> back in the days when there was no social media, I like the internet better 
[14:00:40] <DunceCotus> more than irc, due to its rich media content

[14:01:06] <DunceCotus> and that may seem a blessing

[14:01:24] <DunceCotus> between friends, devs etc.
[14:01:36] <Satin> it just depends on what you want from it on that front i think
[14:01:52] <Satin> some of the issues we associate with social media platforms are more issues with culture/society itself
[14:01:57] <Satin> and how people use it

[15:11:23] <Satin> why owuld there not be

[15:12:05] <Satin> ...
[15:12:28] <MootPoot> say you made a new OS - its now ages behind everything else and theres no reason for anyone to even consider it as an option
[15:12:29] <JesseDesu> and preferabbly does stuff i need
[15:12:36] <Bco1981> DunceCotus: nah, valve will be making closed software that requires specific librarys, this will force any distro that wants to support steam to keep those librarys
[15:12:56] <MootPoot> whatever thing you do get in there will be instantly overtaken by the mature ones having it already
[15:13:02] <DunceCotus> Bco1981: oh right
[15:13:06] <DunceCotus> hrmm
[15:13:10] <MootPoot> its like asking why isen't there any new wheel research
[15:13:12] <JesseDesu> does virtualbox work with a mac host
[15:13:23] <MootPoot> the phrase "dont reinvent the wheel" is a thing for a reason

[15:14:33] <MootPoot> any imporvement you could come up with that's worthwhile in your own OS - just implement it into an existing one with a upcoming large patch

[15:33:43] <Sadale> davic, No ban is to be carried over after the merger tho.
[15:33:46] <davic> This channel would get killed as soon as he starts posting his photos again

[15:36:17] <JesseDesu> i have money for 1
[15:36:27] <Satina> Sadale: no you can believe me
[15:36:28] <Satina> i was there
[15:36:47] <Satina> i don't know the deeper deeper stuff but i know enough to assure you he's really suspect and weird about it.
[15:36:52] <Sadale> davic, He often provide deceptive description just to get someone to be on his side.
[15:36:54] <Satina> and the stuff he posted of his students
[15:37:09] <Sadale> davic, That's what I learned about based on the ##anime-#anime splitter event.
[15:37:15] <Satina> JesseDesu: m1 obviously
[15:37:25] <Satina> who would by the weak mipad
[15:37:25] <davic> Sadale: no, I was here during the pawz time. He ain't kidding about that
[15:37:30] <MootPoot> I need anime injected into my veins

[15:38:15] <Satina> there were three people
[15:38:18] <Satina> who pawz got to viet
[15:38:25] <Sadale> Satina, Anyway I still don't think that any bans should be carried over here. That's my stance.
[15:38:27] <Satina> hans, rene and then another person with e in their name
[15:38:27] <davic> Sadale: this one I agree to disagree on.
[15:38:32] <JesseDesu> satin, m1 ipad || mac mini
[15:38:49] <Satina> eh it doesn't matter, pawz hasn't talked in years/a long while
[15:38:50] <Satina> and if he does
[15:38:56] <Satina> we'll handle it then and get him banned fresh
[15:39:00] <JesseDesu> i feel like he was here last year
[15:39:02] <hans> a third person? member of ##anime ? that i don't recall
[15:39:05] <davic> Satina: he tried to come back a few times, didnt go well sir
[15:39:07] <Sadale> Regardless what he did back in freenode (#)#anime, Libera is a new channel. So no ban should be carried over. If he joined here again, we should treat him as if he's a new user.
[15:39:12] <davic> hans: ah shit u here ?
[15:39:13] <Sadale> (in regard of op-related issues)
[15:39:13] <Satina> hans: besides you and rene

[15:39:26] <hans> davic, not often, but yeah
[15:39:28] <Satina> i can't be tripping this hard

[15:39:55] <hans> yup

[15:40:05] <Sadale> Speaking of creepy I often joke about wanting to bang my imouto as well. And I can totally get away with that :P

[15:40:13] <Sadale> ouch xD
[15:40:15] <davic> Satina: never considered hans to be a sexpat tbh or not that much though
[15:40:17] <hans> she's dual-citizen now, have both a Vietnam and Norway passport ^^

[15:40:33] <Satina> yay hans
[15:40:34] <Sadale> hans, lucky her
[15:40:35] <MootPoot> after some rough calculation - assuming you can put 1 frame of anime on 1 blood cell and you have about 25 trillion blood cells in your body ( google san ) = you should be able to hold 2,170,138,888.888889 episodes of anime in your blood provided that it is stored at 30 fps and 24min each episode
[15:40:44] <MootPoot> idk why I calculated that
[15:40:48] <davic> hans: heard anything from Rene and pawz?

[15:41:17] <ImoutoBot> Satina: enkiv2 was last seen in #anime 5 months and 19 days ago: <enkiv2> kappas need to have magnificent, and in fact prehensile, penises because otherwise while thrusting they would spill their head water
[15:41:41] <MootPoot> kappa
[15:41:45] <hans> davic, Rene's marriage is going to shit, they moved to.. i think it was France? but are breaking up, or have already
[15:41:45] <Satina> kappa
[15:41:55] <hans> as for pawz.. dunno what he's up to
[15:42:04] <Satina> still in viet/aus?
[15:42:08] <MootPoot> Sadale: you should drink more water
[15:42:11] <davic> hans: is this still the girl that was in a wheelchair? or a different one?
[15:42:15] <Sadale> MootPoot, why?
[15:42:17] <hans> Satina, no, i think he's in Mexico or something atm
[15:42:20] <Satina> ah
[15:42:21] <Satina> wild
[15:42:34] <MootPoot> Sadale: feel better - feel better then you can watch more anime
[15:42:39] <MootPoot> Satina: you too
[15:42:41] <MootPoot> dirnk more water
[15:42:42] <Sadale> MootPoot, ah. nice! :3
[15:42:54] <Satina> MootPoot: ive been drinking brisk iced tea all day
[15:42:56] <hans> davic, the girl Rene married was definitely not in a wheelchair
[15:43:03] <Sadale> Here we boil water before drinking them :3
[15:43:10] <Sadale> kills bateria and virus.
[15:43:24] <MootPoot> If you drink enough you turn inot a slime and then you can make as many eyeballs as you need to watch a massive amount at once
[15:43:31] <davic> hans: ah, maybe I remember the wrong girl then. I recall one girl being in a wheelchair and then Rene cheating on her with a different girl
[15:43:31] <MootPoot> Sadale: I thought HK water was safe
[15:43:33] <davic> or something similar
[15:43:43] <Sadale> MootPoot, it's safer than most Asian cities.
[15:44:00] <davic> Sadale: you shouldnt boil it. It's a diet
[15:44:02] <hans> kk
[15:44:22] <JesseDesu> access to poison free water is a basic human right
[15:44:29] <Satina> !seen Terminus 
[15:44:29] <MootPoot> diet water
[15:44:29] <ImoutoBot> Satina: Terminus was last seen in ##anime 1 month and 21 days ago: <Terminus> lol SMR
[15:44:38] <Sadale> MootPoot, Technically it's safe to drink tap water up to the point that the pipe has entered your building. But after entering the building, the pipe's managed by the building's management company, not the government.
[15:44:48] <darkwitch> a bit of poison in the water is good for you
[15:45:16] <JesseDesu> my city's water is tested 100,000 times a day
[15:45:22] <Sadale> MootPoot, If the building's management company isn't maintaining the water pipe well, you'd be drinking all those filthy shit inside the pipe. That's why the government recommends boiling before drinking.
[15:45:33] <Sadale> MootPoot, anyway I've seen expat drinking them from tap without boiling.
[15:45:41] <Sadale> But local? never.
[15:46:05] <Sadale> aww Terminus. The first IRC user that I've ever met :3
[15:46:17] <JesseDesu> The tap water in San Francisco, California, is safe to drink and one of the best in tasting tap water in the U.S. Delicious tap water costs less than half a penny per gallon, is quality examined over 100,000 times a year, and goes straight to your tap.May 26, 2021
[15:46:24] <Sadale> Satina, he visited HK a few years ago. And we met. :3

[15:50:25] <Satina> not something to be happy about
[15:50:32] * Satina hisses at Sadale 
[15:50:32] <Sadale> I'm proud of having a cute sis :3
[15:50:35] <davic> I asked Sadale to bring his sis but apparently her sis was scared of getting kidnapped by Sadale 
[15:50:37] <davic> or something
[15:50:45] <Sadale> lol
[15:50:47] <Satina> DunceCotus: nah davic says he had covid
[15:50:53] <Satina> before covid was announced globally
[15:50:54] <davic> Satina: well
[15:50:54] <davic> ye
[15:50:55] <Satina> he went to china etc

[15:51:03] <Satina> he met sadale on
[15:51:04] <Satina> yeah
[15:51:04] <Sadale> She just doesn't like joining meetup with random internet people that I know. That's because she doesn't even know you guys
[15:51:06] <DunceCotus> hmm wouldn't be surprised
[15:51:21] <davic> came back to EU with cough, not being able to breath
[15:51:23] <davic> and coughing blood
[15:51:26] <davic> and no voice
[15:51:27] <Sadale> Satina, actually davic probably didn't have COVID. Just random meh flu
[15:51:29] <Satina> brought covid back
[15:51:29] <davic> it was a lovely time
[15:51:35] <Satina> Sadale: we'll never know
[15:51:38] <davic> Sadale: nah it was Covid19 Alpha
[15:51:39] <Satina> the full answer
[15:51:40] <DunceCotus> davic: coughing blood doesn't sound like covid
[15:51:40] <JesseDesu> my 16 port 90watt usb hub is holding up really nicely
[15:51:42] <Sadale> Satina, I was with him while he was coughing. And I didn't catch his flu.
[15:51:51] <Satina> Sadale: idk
[15:51:51] <davic> DunceCotus: its one of the symptoms
[15:51:53] <davic> back then
[15:51:56] <DunceCotus> o.O
[15:51:58] <Sadale> Satina, Probably a strain that I've already caught before and recovered and immune to.
[15:52:17] <davic> Sadale: maybe the old HK Covid gave you immunty

[16:33:36] <Sadale> Guest57, I like the culture of IRC better than discord as well. The user base is more mature than most discord communities.
[16:33:55] <amigojapan> Some ways*
[16:34:02] <Guest57> Given that moderators are quite ban-friendly sort of says something about it.
[16:34:11] <Guest57> *ban-happy
[16:34:16] <amigojapan> Guest57: the N word is an immediate ban
[16:34:27] <Bco1981> Nani ??
[16:34:27] <JesseDesu> Nintendo
[16:34:39] <Sadale> actually it depends on which mods are around. I'd avoid the N word here tho.
[16:34:40] <Satina> night
[16:34:50] <Guest57> Really now? Quite a shame, thought it was still tolerant of things like those.
[16:34:51] <Sadale> like avoid using it. Most users doesn't like this word.
[16:35:06] <Satina> why should any chat be tolerant of it lol
[16:35:18] <Sadale> Guest57, it depends on the channel. I don't buy into insta ban for any words tho unless you're using it for intentionally insulting others.
[16:35:26] <Sadale> But some ops here don't agree with that.
[16:35:32] <Guest57> It is a word, do you immediately melt if someone mentions a keyword?
[16:35:34] <Bco1981> people get nigai about it.
[16:35:59] <Satina> no one melts, but some words should certainly be discouraged
[16:36:03] <amigojapan> Bco1981: don't push it
[16:36:05] <Satina> there's quite simply no good reason to use it
[16:36:18] <Guest57> There are connotations but then again. Grow up, if you can't handle words that you don't like.
[16:36:19] <Satina> besides being you know, a less than savoury individual
[16:36:37] <Satina> I don't think it's a matter of being able or not being able to "handle" them
[16:36:38] <Bco1981> amigojapan: japanese, bitter... people get bitter about it is what i said.
[16:36:43] <Sadale> Some people may not know about this kind of rules and they may not mean any harm at all while using a word. And some people can't speak English well.
[16:36:54] <amigojapan> I know what it means Bco1981 
[16:37:15] <Guest57> Sadale Anyone used that excuse yet?
[16:37:17] <Satina> simply put, some phrases are out of bounds in any decent community
[16:37:27] <Satina> the world doesn't exist in a vacumn, maybe you're the one who should grow up
[16:37:35] <Satina> world of irc*
[16:38:03] <Sadale> Guest57, Recently someone got banned for using the n-word. But he did much more than that. He's an obvious troll. He keep calling users here motherf-kers and said anime sucks and shit like that :P
[16:39:24] <Sadale> Guest57, I think it depends on the context. If you're using the n word for stuffs like explaining its history and why it's a bad idea to use it, it's probably fine.
[16:39:29] <Guest57> Satina But don't you think forbidding a word like that gives it some sort of appeal? For one you could just use it to troll people.
[16:40:05] <Sadale> Guest57, And if you don't use the n word intentionally for insulting people, I think you may be able to get away with that. Anyway I'd recommend against using this kind of words. Many of the communites are highly adverse to this kind of words
[16:40:09] <Satina> certainly, but when's the last time normal mature adults went around using words because it was edgy and useful to shock people with
[16:40:18] <Satina> like young children
[16:40:54] <Sadale> Guest57, I think you do have a point. Some people like to break the rules and they'd do it exactly because it's banned :P
[16:40:55] <Guest57> Also, pretty sure behind closed doors all of us in a way have used those words before.
[16:41:02] <Satina> nope
[16:41:04] <Sadale> yep
[16:41:05] <Satina> speak for yourself
[16:41:13] <Satina> though it doesn't really make a difference
[16:41:15] <Sadale> not for me tho. English ain't my first language :P
[16:41:30] <Guest57> You can always choose to ignore it. It's not like someone's forcing you to look at the screen, nor compel you for an opinion.
[16:41:35] <Satina> it's not about being above others or anything like that, whether or not anyone of us has used it or not is not of chief concern here
[16:41:48] <Satina> we could ignore it, but there is a slippery slope here
[16:41:58] <Sadale> Here we call westerner 鬼佬. Literally ghost-man. Depending on the context, it may not mean any harm at all. Some westerners doesn't like being called that. But some are ok with that.
[16:42:14] <Satina> because some of us actually do care about the channel's culture and what we allow/don't allow
[16:42:28] <Guest57> You can choose to be offended or not. Ghost-man sounds pretty cool though.
[16:42:35] <Sadale> I'd say the channel culture should be shaped by the users, not by the ops.
[16:42:43] <Satina> in general this channel and community are the type to leave people to themselves unless they get really annoying, but in that vein we also don't want to lower the channel quality by having racist shit thrown around
[16:42:46] <Satina> and normalized
[16:43:02] <Sadale> users would be the first to be considered. But if most users doesn't like certain words, then please don't use them to keep our users happy
[16:43:10] <Satina> you seem to assume it's all about "handling" and "being offended" when that's far from it, most people here aren't exactly flip-at-a-switch-reactionaries or anything like that
[16:43:35] <Satina> we simply don't want to see it being thrown around and normalized in this channel, as most communities on the internet ever have rules and guidelines for that
[16:43:38] <Sadale> Guest57, just so you know Satina ain't an op :P
[16:43:50] <Satina> yeah but most of the OPs agree with this line of reaosning above
[16:43:59] <Guest57> Satina Of course, but when have you ever seen a conversation or a community go down like that? Of course slurs get tossed out here and there but to have a conversation chain that consist of just using those words seem pretty vapid and boring.
[16:44:04] <Sadale> Satina, I actually don't. Some ops do tho.
[16:44:37] <Guest57> Sadale Op?
[16:44:40] <Satina> Guest57: plenty of time, I've been on the internet long enough to understand why a bunch of OPs here don't want to see racist language/ideas thrown around all the time

[16:44:44] <Sadale> My philosophy is to serve the users first. If the users likes to use all those racial slurs, I don't see why that should be disallowed. Anyway it is not the case here. So I'd recommend avoid using these words.
[16:44:46] <Satina> Guest57: on IRC OP stands for operators
[16:44:50] <Satina> essentially the moderators of a channel
[16:44:53] <amigojapan> Bco1981: people here have been banned in the past four using the manji eventho it is not exactly the same as the swastika
[16:45:08] <Guest57> Oh, guess I haven't been quite used to the new format yet.

[16:46:41] <Satina> it's about channel quality lol
[16:46:45] <Satina> Sadale: i hope so
[16:47:24] <darkwitch> yes, it's about how much shit you are willing to tolerate
[16:47:28] <Satina> Guest57: too much moderation, and no one's having a fun time. too little moderation, and it becomes a repulsive space for anyone wanting to have sane decent conversations
[16:47:33] <Guest57> IF you tilt it a bit you can make it offensive for some people.
[16:47:40] <Sadale> funny how talking about sexual stuffs are allowed here.
[16:47:51] <Satina> balance is hard, but generally this channel is good with it
[16:47:52] <Guest57> But again, does it really turn your breeches if you see an image?

[17:00:57] <Guest57> Satina Pretty neat and spaced out. There might be some kind of hand-writing analyst out there who can pick things up from that.
[17:01:07] <Satina> Lol
[17:01:08] <darkwitch> perhaps so, but it's hard to do Guest57
[17:01:43] <Satina> also when journaling and such
[17:01:49] <Satina> it doesn't feel the same at all to type things out
[17:01:52] <Satina> though both can work for me
[17:01:59] <Guest57> darkwitch I remember a few years ago, electrical stimulation and a taste-chord are already available. Or at their prototype phases.
[17:02:08] <Satina> or when venting, rarely, for me, letting it with a pen is better
[17:02:33] <JesseDesu> tasty treats
[17:02:39] <Guest57> Smell though. Can't really say. Simulating the olfactory system is pretty difficult to do if you don't aerosolize them or something.

[18:11:23] <Sadale> Yep. In bakeries here, there're dishes and BBQ tongs that the customers can use for putting the breads onto the dish. Then when you're paying the bill, you go to the cashier with the tong and the dish with bread on it. The cashier would put them into a plastic bag. You pay for the bill, and you can take away the breads.

[18:15:22] <JesseDesu> sadale start a gofundme
[18:15:25] <Sadale> Inside the apartment, there's a dedicated cargo elevator window that you can take the stuffs taht you've ordered.

[18:50:30] <Satin> 2017 mein, leave kiya US ko
[18:50:31] <Roey> HubertFarnsworth: in what way
[18:50:35] <Sadale> And Sadale is a lewd cat
[18:50:35] <Sxem> i was fluent in esperanto in the 90s, and now im like 1/3 fluent
[18:50:38] <Roey> :)
[18:50:51] <Satin> aur 2020 meri discovery thi ki aabhi india mein liberal vs conseravative divide hain
[18:50:51] <Roey> Sxem: so one of my best friends in college, she participated in a few Eo congresses
[18:51:00] <HubertFarnsworth> Roey: in his way of thinking and living, his love for science
[18:51:06] <Roey> <- eterna komençanto
[18:51:11] <Roey> aye
[18:51:17] <Sadale> Sxem, I'm still actively using toki pona. I'm now like 70% fluent for conversing verbally :3
[18:51:22] <Roey> :)
[18:51:22] <Sxem> i hosted an esperanto meeting where we watched the esperanto shatner movie
[18:51:24] <Satin> ajeeb hain. congress aur bjp ki divide secularism aur extreme hinduism par tha
[18:51:27] <Sxem> nice
[18:51:29] <Sadale> For written communication I'm like pretty good :3
[18:51:30] <Roey> Sadale: I wonder if there's a channel here for toki pona
[18:51:35] <Sadale> Roey, yep
[18:51:36] <Roey> Sxem: nice :)
[18:51:36] <Satin> liberal vs conservative par nahi
[18:51:38] <Sadale> Roey, ##tokipona
[18:51:42] <Roey> Sadale: thnak yuou!
[18:51:51] <Sadale> Roey, It's bridged to a telegram group
[18:51:53] <Sxem> i decided not to learn toki pona. 130 words just seems way too small
[18:52:06] <Sxem> id need at least triple that
[18:52:08] <Sadale> Roey, so whatever you say there will be hosted on telegram's server. Please keep that in mind.
[18:52:12] <Satin> aur bohot parties india mein tradition aur regional concerns aur caste par based hooya tha
[18:52:24] <Roey> Sadale: sure
[18:52:28] <Roey> understood, thanks for letting me know
[18:52:29] <Satin> aap kya par based hain?
[18:52:41] <Satin> kya based par karenge? liberal vs conservative?
[18:52:50] <Sxem> they shd make a 333 word version of toki pona
[18:52:56] <Sxem> for ppl who like the number 3
[18:53:51] <Satin> centralization of power bhi, presidency style jaise modi ne kiya
[18:53:59] <Satin> 2014 mein
[18:55:02] <Satin> advantages hain, par negative bhi hain ki aisye liberal vs conservative polarized politics quickly spread hooya
[18:55:12] <HubertFarnsworth> Satin: the divide between isn't just related to liberal or Hinduism, their whole ideology is different. Congress is more towards to left with more social schemes while BJP is opposite. 
[18:55:14] <Satin> regional parties aur coalition se
[18:55:27] <Satin> I don't know enough of that history to know that
[18:55:37] <Satin> growing up i barely saw a damm difference between the two
[18:55:39] <Satin> minus rethoric
[18:55:50] <Satin> and the fact that the congress were clearly more tolerant towards muslims
[18:56:04] <Sadale> no fair! HubertFarnsworth can read what Satin wrote but I can't
[18:56:05] <Satin> i didn't think BJP explicitly cut back on social schemes
[18:56:10] <HubertFarnsworth> That centralisation is happening because states have to rely on centre for money and resources.
[18:56:26] <Satin> Sadale: i was just ranting about indian politics and how different it is now than when i grew up
[18:56:31] <Sadale> aw
[18:56:34] <HubertFarnsworth> I think they did but I'm not sure either
[18:56:35] <Sadale> huh?
[18:56:42] <Sadale> Satin, weren't you just in india for a short time?
[18:56:47] <Satin> no
[18:56:50] <Sadale> oh.
[18:56:59] <Sadale> That'd explain why you could speak hindi
[18:57:07] <Sadale> I thought that you were only there for a few years
[18:57:09] <Satin> parents are missionaries, went and back and forth
[18:57:14] <Satin> 2006-2012
[18:57:14] <Sadale> ah. back and forth
[18:57:16] <Satin> then again

[18:57:26] <Sadale> Satin, your parents are cool.
[18:57:28] <Satin> the latter was sheer tortur but whatever
[18:57:31] <Satin> Sadale: no they aren't
[18:57:33] <Sadale> Satin, my parents are stupid and uneducated :/
[18:57:34] <Satin> but that's a whole other topic
[18:57:49] <Satin> Sadale: there's nothing wrong with being unedecatudeas long as your heart is in the right place
[18:58:05] <Satin> uneducated as long as*
[18:58:06] <HubertFarnsworth> First gen kids of immigrants will speak the language Sadale. 2nd gen kids somewhat and next generations will forget them altogether
[18:58:08] <Sadale> Satin, as for my dad, he isn't just uneducated. He's stupid af with an evil heart :/
[18:58:20] <Satin> sorry to hear that sadale
[18:58:20] <Sadale> honestly this guy's bullshit
[18:58:40] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, ouch
[18:58:42] <Satin> I don't rly speak hindi
[18:58:48] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, But Satin's American.
[18:58:58] <Roey> Satin: how did you get into Hindi then?
[18:59:04] <Satin> Roey: exposure
[18:59:06] <Sadale> exposure she said
[18:59:06] <Roey> :)
[18:59:07] <Satin> i know 0 grammar rules
[18:59:10] <Roey> ahhhhhh
[18:59:16] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: she's daughter of first gen immigrants
[18:59:18] <Sadale> I'm surprised that you could learn that much just from exposure
[18:59:18] <Satin> and vocabulary
[18:59:30] <Roey> I can ask you for your name in Hebrew.  And also specify which menu items I'd like.
[18:59:35] <Satin> Sadale: when you spend most of your childhood exposed to it there's a lot yoy can learn
[18:59:37] <Roey> I can ask you for your name in Hindi.  And also specify which menu items I'd like. *
[18:59:40] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, nope. Her parents isn't immigrants. Her parents just go there back and forth
[18:59:43] <Roey> (also in Hebrew tho)
[18:59:49] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: i'm ambigious about that detail :p
[18:59:58] <Satin> who knows~
[19:00:04] <Satin> in either case
[19:00:18] <Satin> it's not really a case where i speak the language, if i did i wouldn't have any issues or whatever
[19:00:27] <Satin> my family and me only ever speak in english

[19:00:45] <HubertFarnsworth> Satin: that usually seems to be like that, I'm not generalising but I've seen a lot of families like that.
[19:00:54] <Satin> yeah i understand
[19:01:21] <HubertFarnsworth> I've just as much relatives in America as in India, Satin 
[19:01:27] <Satin> for me i had to try to figure out the symbols and characters myself, and my reading is probably very elementry level LOL
[19:01:36] <Satin> and most of my younger siblings can't understand at all
[19:01:43] <Satin> i only can becauuse i put 1% effort into trying to read
[19:01:46] <Satin> characters
[19:01:54] <Satin> a(and even then i don't know all the symbols xd)
[19:02:02] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, anyway that's often how languages die off :-(
[19:02:10] <Satin> Sadale: india has plenty of people for that not to happen
[19:02:27] <Sadale> lucky
[19:02:28] <Satin> and i don't feel indian in any form or way particularly as much as i do american
[19:02:44] <Satin> whevere i do feel ""indian""" or connected is specific parts of the state i half grew up in, maharastra
[19:02:53] <Satin> but marathi is so hard to speak lo
[19:02:53] <Satin> l
[19:02:55] <HubertFarnsworth> Well it's upto people who speak these languages. 
[19:02:56] <Sadale> In some places on the earth English's taking over local languages.
[19:03:00] <Satin> i only understand when my parents speak sometimes
[19:03:21] <Sadale> So the local langauges would die off after a few generations :-(

[19:03:39] <Bco1981> okay... raspbian OS... don't do dist-upgrade... all icons in the menus are missing now.
[19:03:42] <Satin> i also love a lot of indian food
[19:04:06] <Satin> and i care about indian politics to an extent because i grew up there and cultural tensions are fascinating/interesting for sure
[19:04:15] <Satin> but beyond that? yeah nah i've seen the ugly sides as well
[19:04:27] <Satin> so many women stuck in the kitchen
[19:04:42] <Satin> forced into submission and being slaves by tradition and customs
[19:04:47] <Satin> and rape and all of that
[19:04:49] <Sadale> Satin, I can relate to that for politics. Those kids here protesting for something that I don't even care about. :/
[19:04:56] <Satin> Lol
[19:05:08] <Sadale> Satin, and I have to face the consequence for that like saction and shit. :/
[19:05:11] <Sadale> no fair.
[19:05:18] <Satin> understandable
[19:05:30] <Satin> but back to the topic sagan uh
[19:05:38] <HubertFarnsworth> Yeah, in this busy lifestyle, it's hard to keep interests on anything that's not related to us. Imagine the amount of effort for people to make their offsprings learn their language in a foreign ntion, heh
[19:06:11] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: idk what i'm saying is my situation is very removed from that sort of thing
[19:06:16] <Satin> like
[19:06:28] <Satin> it's not anything related to time or effort
[19:06:28] <HubertFarnsworth> Satin: my father doesn't care about any news that's out of this state.
[19:06:51] <Satin> it's just like at its core, my family is a weird combination of southern baptist conservative values with other stuff
[19:07:04] <HubertFarnsworth> Yeah
[19:07:04] <Satin> I genuinely can't find a pre-made category to fit in or whatever
[19:07:22] <Satin> my parents might strongly know their cultures and customs
[19:07:28] <HubertFarnsworth> Everyone has their own unique circumstances.
[19:07:29] <Satin> but they didn't even remotely try to make us have that
[19:07:31] <Satin> yeah
[19:07:40] <Satin> and then ontop of that sort of weirdness, I broke away from all of that at an early age
[19:07:52] <HubertFarnsworth> I'm not big on culture. I find it meh.
[19:08:23] <HubertFarnsworth> Customs too
[19:08:27] <Satin> culture is important to me, and i keep trying to dig through it, even in the US (e.g. i pay attention to the details as someone who lives in new mexico currently, vs someone who lives in the midwest and so on)
[19:08:35] <Satin> because it relates a lot to identity and so on
[19:08:42] <HubertFarnsworth> I don't mean any disrespect to other cultures. 
[19:08:46] <Satin> everyone has one, no matter what they think, there is no "default" per se
[19:08:50] <Satin> but still
[19:09:05] <Satin> it's hard when there's nothing to accurately identify with beforehand lol
[19:09:14] <Satin> so i kind of just accept that at the end of the day
[19:09:18] <HubertFarnsworth> Because of your identity, Satin?
[19:09:35] <Satin> because what?
[19:09:44] <Satin> what are you saying that in response to*
[19:09:53] <HubertFarnsworth> Culture is important to you
[19:09:56] <Satin> oh
[19:10:07] <Satin> uh, not just because of my own identity issues or discovery
[19:10:16] <Satin> but because I'm just that sort of person? interested in meta details?
[19:10:26] <HubertFarnsworth> I see.
[19:10:32] <Satin> it's not particularly about me even
[19:10:46] <Satin> cultural differences fascinate me when it comes to different political groups too
[19:10:53] <Satin> e.g. cuban americans voting the way they do from florida
[19:10:59] <Satin> or latinos in other parts of this country
[19:11:05] <Satin> middle america/rural culture and so on
[19:11:21] <Satin> and things like class culture and so on
[19:11:42] <Satin> people think they're completely freewill actors or something
[19:12:15] <Satin> when their behaviour is often molded and influenced by the social obligations and customs and culture and what not around them
[19:12:18] <Satin> it's not a bad thing
[19:12:23] <HubertFarnsworth> But cultures are always changing. They change with times, developments in science and technology.
[19:12:44] <Satin> yes, they're always changing, but they often have a thread with the past, depending on how they're transmitted from one generation to the next
[19:12:56] <HubertFarnsworth> Yeah.
[19:13:04] <Satin> one of my biggest criticisms of the american left in this day and age is
[19:13:12] <Satin> that these dumbasses only know how to criticize
[19:13:34] <Satin> and it's importnat to criticize and call out things like how this country was built on bloodshed and genocide against native americans, and black people and so on
[19:13:36] <Satin> and slavery
[19:13:42] <Satin> but the mistake they make is just stopping there
[19:13:53] <Satin> they don't have any concept of working towards a new sense of american cultural identity
[19:14:01] <HubertFarnsworth> American left, lol
[19:14:09] <Satin> and the result is what? the right wing in this country grab onto the american flag
[19:14:11] <Satin> and other symbols
[19:14:25] <Satin> if you see american flags on pickup trucks or on people's houses
[19:14:26] <HubertFarnsworth> Ugh, I hate those stuff
[19:14:34] <Satin> you immediatly associate that with conservative patrotic bullshit now
[19:14:39] <Satin> in recent years
[19:14:48] <Satin> and even in twitter bios etc
[19:14:58] *** Quits: Mr_Misery (~weechat@8.20.101.205) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[19:14:59] <Satin> the imagery, the symbolism is grabbed on wholesale by the right now
[19:15:11] <Satin> because the american left is incompetent at providing a new cultural identity
[19:15:15] <HubertFarnsworth> Nah, I just hate those kind of flag waving, proud to be something stuff
[19:15:16] <Satin> to work towards
[19:15:23] <Satin> eh, i don't inherently hate it
[19:15:36] <Satin> i know why you hate it, indians do it too often
[19:15:49] <Satin> but it's important once again to have national identity
[19:16:13] <HubertFarnsworth> Yeah, that sort of wearing patriotism on sleeves is just blegh.
[19:16:19] <Satin> we're not all the same countries or anything like that, even if globalist neoliberalism (influenced by american soft culture power btw and hollywood) would have you otherwise
[19:16:22] *** Joins: Mr_Misery (~weechat@8.20.101.205)
[19:16:22] <Satin> yeahhhhh
[19:16:25] <Satin> it's easy to go overboard
[19:16:42] <Satin> but in my opinion, modern european countries like france and so on
[19:16:48] <Satin> for the most part seem sane about their nationalism
[19:16:57] <Satin> or maybe they're just too whiplashed by the lessons of world war 2 xd
[19:17:09] <Satin> that they're sober about it
[19:17:31] <Satin> but at the same time they're not entirely just ignorant of national identity and differences as a distinct culture
[19:17:48] <HubertFarnsworth> I bet these people really don't do much for their country. The real heroes never did these kind of stuff. I am inspired by American!
[19:17:56] <Satin> yeah it gets really delusional
[19:18:06] <Satin> it gets used to justify all sorts of garbage, and trambling on the poor, and mroe
[19:18:10] <Satin> trampling*
[19:18:25] <Satin> but at the same time i'm not against being nationalistic in a sane sense, and caring about your cultural identity
[19:18:42] <Satin> but it's easier said than done
[19:18:58] <Satin> to not fall into that trap of american excpetionalism, manifest destiny and "we're the freeest country in the world!" shit
[19:20:17] <HubertFarnsworth> I used to think like that when I was kid. You know, America is the nation to make things happen, to succeed regardless of one's color or culture. 
[19:20:30] <HubertFarnsworth> But man, that image is ruined
[19:20:56] <Satin> because it was a lie
[19:20:59] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Ressha Hen | Episode: 5
[19:21:02] <Satin> yes, aspects of it are absolutely true
[19:21:16] <Satin> plenty of immigrants have come here and succeeded based on their own merits and so on
[19:21:28] <Satin> but there are other sides of this that are concealed and covered by that 
[19:21:46] <Satin> such as the fact that a lot of american neoliberal is sort of cultural impenralism spread to other countries
[19:21:53] <Satin> soft power
[19:22:14] <Satin> it covers up systematic discrimination often
[19:22:22] <Sadale> sad
[19:22:56] <Bco1981> ale
[19:22:58] <Sadale> At this point I just stop caring about htis world at all
[19:23:06] <Satin> it also covers up the way "just work harder" is used to justify the richest preserving their wealth at any cost and so on
[19:23:13] <HeTo> Satin: you're still awake?
[19:23:14] <Sadale> lol
[19:23:17] <Sadale> Satin, sad.
[19:23:18] <Satin> HeTo: lol yes
[19:23:42] <Satin> Sadale: but i very much prefer an american neoliberal system to fix over the ******e one but that's another topic
[19:23:42] <Sadale> Satin, I'm wondering if I'd see another worker revolution in my life time in a major nation.
[19:24:01] <Sadale> With all those exploit of the poor and shit going on everywhere :/
[19:24:02] <HubertFarnsworth> Yeah, America still doesn't have proper minimum wage system.
[19:24:08] <Satin> both things can co-exist in the same world man
[19:24:30] <Satin> the US can both be one of the biggest modernizers, and under it's watch, organizations like the UN, IMF and so on can happen
[19:24:36] <Satin> under the auspices of liberalism as an ideology
[19:24:37] <Sadale> Personally tho I just stop caring about others. I'm now trying to save up money to retire early and live on the internet.
[19:24:43] <HubertFarnsworth> It's hard to just survive for normal people in America and a health issue can easily fuck up and lose all the money.
[19:24:53] <Sadale> sad
[19:25:03] <Satin> and at the same time one of the worst atrocities in modern human history can happen in the middle east
[19:25:17] <Satin> and wars can fuel the coffers of dick cheney
[19:25:20] <Satin> and the warhawks
[19:25:24] <Satin> in the american establishment 
[19:25:29] <Satin> greedy for oil and all of that
[19:26:10] <Satin> but the biggest mistake y'all can do is just act like there's some "default" ideology that is good and at play
[19:26:13] <Sadale> Considered that this world sucks so badly, living longer to those middle east people could be just suffering.
[19:26:21] <Satin> every single thing, even the nice stuff that come from globalism, needs to be reconsidered strongly
[19:26:39] <Satin> all this nice stuff, even things like being able to easily travel to other countries and so on, and cheaper stuff from china
[19:26:48] <Satin> what costs does it have? what system is it working under?
[19:26:56] <Satin> so many displaced american workers
[19:26:59] <Sadale> Not that death is nice to them. But it could be better than having a bad life to some people. :( damn. I've said something very dark :'(
[19:27:22] <Satin> yeah
[19:27:38] <Satin> i'm fundamentally somewhat a pessemsetic person but i'm not also a doomer or something
[19:27:48] <JesseDesu> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEMn3fdVsJ0 i like this song
[19:27:49] <ImoutoBot> [youtube] pray | Duration: 3 minutes, 24 seconds
[19:27:56] <Satin> and i'd argue that past human eras were filled with their bad stuff as well
[19:27:58] <Sadale> basically I just stop caring. This world's far too sad for me to care about
[19:28:10] <HubertFarnsworth> There isn't any default ideology that's good.
[19:28:13] <Satin> and that we're just more exposed to all of this, because we're more connected and involved in all of this and so on
[19:28:26] <HubertFarnsworth> Satin: have you read any Simone Weil?
[19:28:31] <Satin> not yet
[19:28:40] * Sadale clicks
[19:28:45] <Satin> Sadale: imagine if you grew up in the 50s or 70s
[19:28:54] <Satin> you wouldn't have the internet to know about what was happening in the middle east or whatever
[19:29:00] <HubertFarnsworth> She says all political parties are totalitarian
[19:29:04] <Satin> and they would impact you less and vica vesrsa
[19:29:11] <Sadale> Satin, true
[19:29:16] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: lol, i haven't read her reasoning for it but that sounds a bit extreme of a take
[19:29:45] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: i would agree happily with her in a sense tho
[19:29:46] <Sadale> Satin, I've heard that money were easier to made back in the days tho
[19:29:57] <Sadale> Satin, the wealth inequality were less bad.
[19:29:57] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: it's important, very important, for change to keep happening
[19:30:03] <Satin> otherwise things become totarlian, rigid
[19:30:04] <HubertFarnsworth> Yeah, she has an interesting take. Poor girl, died way too early btw Satin 
[19:30:05] <Satin> oppressive
[19:30:07] <Satin> hearhichical
[19:30:23] <Satin> change and difference are good
[19:30:29] <Satin>  ~ giles delueze moment
[19:30:33] <Satin> awh i see
[19:32:08] <HubertFarnsworth> Honestly, I'm not big on politics or people. They both suck.
[19:32:13] <Sadale> lol
[19:32:46] <Sadale> you know what's difference between capitalism and communism? In capitalism, it's man exploits man.
[19:32:50] <Sadale> In communism, it's the other way around
[19:32:52] <HubertFarnsworth> If I can get through life with little global warming, floods, draughts and disasters, I'm happy.
[19:32:59] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth++
[19:33:50] <HubertFarnsworth> There's no system of government that works for all because people suck.
[19:34:04] <Sadale> true
[19:34:30] <HubertFarnsworth> Can have communist or capitalist utopia but it doesn't happen because of people.
[19:34:37] <Sadale> ouch
[19:34:50] <Sadale> Does that mean that war is savior of humanity? :O
[19:35:02] <Sadale> less people means less sucky world.
[19:35:19] <HubertFarnsworth> Less sucky people
[19:35:26] <Sadale> I mean people causes global warming, floods, draughts and disasters :P
[19:35:35] <HubertFarnsworth> Need a world full of Carl Sagans
[19:36:34] <Sadale> need a world full of Sadale :P
[19:37:16] <Sadale> come to think about it, what's even is the meaning of life?
[19:37:19] <Boradt> if Sadale is a cute fit girl with nice feet, then yes
[19:37:24] <Sadale> Boradt, lol
[19:37:31] <Sadale> Boradt, you sounds like beaky xD
[19:37:47] <Boradt> who's beaky O.o
[19:38:04] <Sadale> Boradt, beaky is a user here who's into fir girls and feet.
[19:38:14] <Sadale> Boradt, he used to be very active here. And he's a mascot of this channel
[19:38:22] <Boradt> oh, nice
[19:38:22] <Sadale> He also like tea
[19:38:39] <Sadale> He claims to be a NEET. I've no idea on where he got the money to keep him floating
[19:39:07] <Boradt> well, either rich parents/sugar momma or he's lying
[19:39:12] <Sadale> lol

[19:41:23] <Sadale> :-(
[19:41:39] <Sadale> stupid capitalism
[19:42:44] <Boradt> well, it's not stupid, it's actually pretty well thought out. it's just it's immoral and evil
[19:43:30] <Sadale> I'd say capitalism just come out naturally from market economy
[19:43:44] <Satin> nah

[19:44:58] *** Joins: aHick (~memes@143.60.228.11)
[19:45:03] <Satin> it's 9 am now
[19:45:09] <Satin> i'm just messing with the Qtcreator thing
[19:45:20] <Boradt> oh yeah? what's that for?
[19:45:39] <Satin> i wrote a very very very simple json supporting c program that tracks book entries a bit ago
[19:45:43] <Satin> for practice
[19:45:48] <Satin> in C
[19:45:49] <Satin> and now i want a GUI for it
[19:45:53] <Boradt> ah
[19:46:00] <Satin> so trying to achieve that with Qt
[19:46:09] <Boradt> so Qtcreator is stuff to make guis with Qt toolkit?
[19:46:12] <HeTo> well, you don't need Qt Creator for that
[19:46:27] <Satin> yeah
[19:46:30] <Satin> HeTo: why not?
[19:47:05] <HeTo> you can write code with any text editor
[19:47:32] <HeTo> if you want to use Qt Widgets you will probably need Qt Designer, but I would suggest Qt Quick
[19:47:37] <Satin> that's true, but for the GUI stuff isn't it better to hve that?
[19:47:45] <Satin> what is QtCreator then
[19:47:50] <Satin> isn't it for the GUI design
[19:47:59] <Satin> or is it the IDE component?
[19:48:00] <HeTo> and personally I've written QML by hand. you see a lot better what you're doing
[19:48:05] <HeTo> Qt Creator is the full IDE
[19:48:09] <Satin> ah i see
[19:48:14] <Satin> well
[19:48:17] <HeTo> it includes project management and integrates a text editor and Qt Designer
[19:48:30] <HeTo> not saying you shouldn't use it though, if it works for you
[19:48:37] <Satin> yeah i see
[19:48:46] <Satin> it's been giving me a kit error or something
[19:48:54] <Satin> so i'm just downloading qt as well now
[19:49:16] <HeTo> you should already have Qt if you're running Linux... well, very probably
[19:49:23] <Satin> i dunno
[19:49:25] <HeTo> although you might need development packages
[19:49:25] <Satin> popos distro
[19:49:29] <Satin> stuff
[19:49:32] <Satin> i guess ic an check
[19:49:47] <HeTo> anyway, I'd suggest getting stuff from the distro repositories
[19:50:06] <HeTo> you'd expect that stuff to just work
[19:50:18] <Satin> uh
[19:50:21] <Satin> yeah
[19:50:23] <Satin> i dunno about that
[19:50:45] <Satin> i'm just torrenting it from the qt site itself
[19:50:47] <Satin> chmod +x 
[19:50:47] <Satin> etc
[19:50:52] <Satin> thi times aorund
[19:51:06] * Satin doesn't actually want to update her system because of 3 GB updates
[19:51:32] * Satin and the terminal doesn't recognize sudo apt-get install qt5

[19:55:04] <Satin> wait what is packages.ubuntu.com
[19:55:07] <Boradt> good night Sadale
[19:55:17] <Satin> does that mean that ubuntu helper package stuff
[19:55:20] <Satin> won't work either?
[19:55:24] <Satin> or are those separate from the site
[19:55:29] <HeTo> Satin: it's a site where you can search for Ubuntu packages
[19:55:32] <Satin> ah
[19:55:39] <Satin> what tf is launchpad then?
[19:55:41] <HeTo> apt probably uses a mirror so shouldn't be affected
[19:55:56] <HeTo> packages.ubuntu.com shows you packages that are included in one of the Ubuntu repositories
[19:56:09] <Satin> ah
[19:56:28] <HeTo> I'm not on Ubuntu right now so I can't just load aptitude
[19:56:34] <Satin> sorry for all the noob questions, i'm a bit more familiar with the arch ecosystem than ubuntu
[19:56:43] <Satin> AUR is soo easy
[19:56:51] <Satin> i see
[19:58:13] <HubertFarnsworth> Life is because of increasing entropy Sadale 
[19:58:51] <HeTo> although if the packages from the Qt site install in their own directory I suppose those could work and not break much
[19:59:08] <Satin> yeah the ubuntu package is a mess holy fuck
[19:59:12] <Satin> from these forum posts
[19:59:14] <Satin> for it
[19:59:39] <HubertFarnsworth> Why not use Debian HeTo?
[20:00:32] <HeTo> HubertFarnsworth: Satin said she was using Pop! OS. as I don't know if it has an online package search engine, I figured I would check the Ubuntu packages, because IIRC Pop! OS is based on Ubuntu
[20:00:42] <Satin> true
[20:01:21] <HubertFarnsworth> Qt packages run on other GUI fine if installed properly
[20:01:38] <Guest57> It's usually either Pop! or Manjaro. Depends on the case but both of those are good for daily drivers and mainly gaming.

[20:06:13] <JesseDesu> sometimes i mess with old drawings and i come to the realization i shouldnt of messed with it
[20:06:29] <HeTo> Satin: it looks like installing qtbase5-dev and qtbase5-dev-tools and perhaps qtchooser, as suggested by the answer, should get you the tools needed for building Qt software. then you'll just need a build system, I'd suggest CMake, since it should also be supported by Qt Creator, and is a lot better than QMake, at least
[20:06:43] <Satin> lol
[20:06:45] <HeTo> Satin: and qtcreator is also available in the Ubuntu repositories
[20:07:32] <HeTo> also, Qt comes with its own JSON library, I'd suggest using that, which doesn't leave much of your original app for use
[20:08:22] <fourcemob> I thought this was at has builder to setup projects too
[20:09:16] <fourcemob> Auto correct.. I thought that has builder too that sets up projects for you and is an ide
[20:09:51] <HeTo> anyway, if you want to do it properly, I suppose the way to go is to build an item model class for your database in C++, then build a GUI using QML and Qt Quick Controls 2. just hook the model up to a table view or whatever you want and then create some way to also add new entries. if you need access that's not directly available through the Qt model... model, you can use Q_INVOKABLE to create member 
[20:09:57] <HeTo> functions that can be called from QML
[20:10:36] <Satin> interesting.
[20:10:43] <Satin> well I want to do it in C specifically
[20:10:49] <Satin> this time around
[20:11:02] <Satin> but ill keep that in mind, thank u
[20:11:03] <HeTo> well, Qt is C++ and QML
[20:11:08] <Satin> yeah
[20:11:16] <HeTo> while there are Python bindings, I don't think there are C bindings
[20:11:34] <Satin> at least from what i've been reading online
[20:11:37] <Satin> it's possible to use C code
[20:11:49] <Satin> as long as you pretend it's C++ at the end during some of the compiling part
[20:11:49] <Satin> s
[20:11:58] <Satin> C-style code
[20:12:12] <Satin> this is going to be scuffed
[20:12:49] <Satin> i guess it's running for me at least
[20:12:51] <HeTo> well, if you need to inherit from a C++ class, or create C++ objects, or call a C++ function that's not explicitly exported for use from C, or use templates, you'll have to use C++ at least for those parts

[22:12:15] <emmeka> nym_ linking pirated content isn't allowed on libera.
[22:12:23] <emmeka> nobody will do that for you here
[22:13:27] <emmeka> nym_ but I can tell you this: if you've already found nyaa that's basically the best there is besides private trackers
[22:14:17] <nym_> thanks, weird rule for le haxor gentooman server 
[22:15:55] <emmeka> nym_ libera is a server for official free software projects, not "hackers", and so obviously they prioritize that above all else and having the network get DMCA'd because some dorks in an anime channel were linking torrents would be bad.

[22:25:03] <emmeka> nym_ I mean if you want to know, just go on over to Rizon, which is a wild west where you can talk about these things and find some channels explicitly for getting on private trackers and shit

[22:26:20] <emmeka> but here we have to be good law-abiding citizens for the sake of FOSS.

[22:26:21] <nym_> good advice, sorry for asking the obvious but can you be connected to multiple irc servers with one client? or just one connection per client
[22:26:25] <jessedesu3> Wb
[22:26:30] <emmeka> nym_ you can, yes.
[22:26:40] <nym_> cool
[22:26:41] <emmeka> as many as you want, and as many channels as you want.
[22:27:02] <jessedesu3> What are private trackers anyway
[22:27:14] <emmeka> non-public trackers :P
[22:27:37] <jessedesu3> Is there something they have
[22:27:47] <jessedesu3> That public ones dont
[22:27:49] <emmeka> when you pull a torrent it's just basically a list of trackers and a way for those trackers to identify a file, private trackers are just ones that require some sort of login credentials to access
[22:28:11] <jessedesu3> Is there more stuff
[22:28:23] <jessedesu3> If not what's the point
[22:28:27] <emmeka> generally, and more seeders, because private trackers mandate minimum seeding ratios

[22:29:37] <nym_> hia
[22:30:12] <emmeka> oh hey would you look at that, we hit 200 users.
[22:30:24] <jessedesu3> A first?
[22:30:46] <jessedesu3> Freenode anime averaged 230 without r mode
[22:31:02] <emmeka> well, maybe not, I haven't been paying that much attention. But it's higher than when we first migrated.
[22:31:06] <Aresy> I'm the 200th, I'm very lucky
[22:31:09] <emmeka> and approaching peak freenode
[22:32:00] <Aresy> Was there few people before?

[22:34:25] <emmeka> Aresy nah, but right after we migrated from freenode, not everyone made it over, we were maybe around ~125
