[09:14:26] <quanticle> Translation: "we never thought we'd never see a check with this many trailing zeroes"
[09:15:20] <gerikson> LOL
[09:22:12] <quanticle> I mean, for $500 million, I can definitely "realize" I "share the same vision" as you
[09:22:22] <quanticle> Regardless of what that vision actually is
[09:23:19] <gerikson> ``Itâ€™s a foolish errand trying to ensure the freedom of users who donâ€™t care to take responsibility and an active interest in the tools they use.''
[10:30:58] <gerikson> oh now H_S enters the fray

[10:38:07] <quanticle> Ah
[10:40:03] <quanticle> Oh, I was wondering why I hadn't seen them on the libera #lobsters
[10:40:09] <quanticle> Didn't see that they'd been banned, lol
[10:45:43] <gerikson> they tended to go very off-topic all the time
[10:46:00] <quanticle> I'm not surprised
[10:46:05] <quanticle> (About the ban, that is)
[10:47:43] <gerikson> heh
[10:47:47] <gerikson> can't see the banlist
[10:48:04] <gerikson> oh there it is
[10:48:28] <gerikson> I wrote this in reply to friendlysock's comment but I'd like to imagine it's too cruel http://simp.ly/p/Rcmc4d
[10:48:28] <buttsbot> Reply to friendlysock
[10:48:44] <gerikson> also no-one but me understands the "spleen" reference
[10:58:52] <riv> simp.ly ??
[10:59:59] <riv> > Blackstone said in a press release that it is interested in the company because of CCG's role in the "physical and digital collectible" space.
[11:00:03] <riv> *pukes*

[11:05:00] <gerikson> riv: Simplenote
[11:06:20] <quanticle> riv: Did you hear about my hedge fund idea?
[11:07:34] <riv> no, tell!
[11:09:33] <quanticle> So I was reading about the MGM auction (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_memorabilia#1970_MGM_auction), where Debbie Reynolds spent $180,000 for a bunch of old MGM film memorabilia (including the original ruby slippers from _The Wizard of Oz_), and then after a couple of decades, resold it for millions. So I thought why not do this... with stuff from streamers and famous Youtubers?
[11:09:33] <buttsbot> Film memorabilia - Wikipedia
[11:09:46] <quanticle> Like... get some original consoles, controllers, swag, etc
[11:09:50] <quanticle> Hoard it for 20 years
[11:09:54] <quanticle> Resesll for $$$$
[11:10:11] <quanticle> Of course 90% of it would be absolute junk
[11:10:13] <quanticle> Worth 0
[11:10:32] <quanticle> But the one thing you pay like a thousand bucks for and resell for a million would make up for it
[11:11:17] <quanticle> And you could go to semi-famous Youtubers and be like, "You want a thousand bucks for a new mic? No problem. Just sell us your old one"
[11:12:08] <gerikson> people "invest" in old cars like that
[11:12:16] <gerikson> and ofc the art "market" is this
[11:12:47] <quanticle> Right. I was thinking about this in the context of Pokemon cards, which have skyrocketed in value because all the '90s kids are now old and rich
[11:13:01] <quanticle> And I was thinking what kids *today* interested in?
[11:13:02] <riv> quanticle, ahahaha
[11:13:03] <riv> i love it
[11:13:08] <quanticle> Not Pokemon cards, that's for sure.
[11:13:12] <gerikson> lol
[11:13:43] <riv> I just dig out some pokemon cards recently
[11:13:51] <riv> got 2 shiny ones in there
[11:14:06] <quanticle> But like, if you have something like, "Oh this is the controller $FAMOUS_SPEEDRUNNER completed their record breaking speedrun with"
[11:14:13] <quanticle> That could be worth real cash 20 years from now
[11:16:48] <gerikson> possibly
[11:17:47] <quanticle> Anyway, I'll never actually do this
[11:17:50] <quanticle> But if someone does
[11:18:06] <quanticle> I will be very happy to cite this conversation and state smugly, "Yeah, well, I thought of it first"
[11:19:12] <gerikson> patent the idea!
[11:19:26] <quanticle> Hah

[18:25:03] <cb> geoff isn't here but that article made me think of mark tarver's criticism of free software
[18:26:49] <cb> anyways i think part of free software is its total isolation from the imapct of the economic consequences
[18:28:13] <quanticle> What do you mean by "total isolation from the economic consequences"?
[18:30:13] <cb> stallman basically was a neet at MIT and i get the feeling he had no idea of how free software was going to be economically sustainable. he could guess, but it's not like he'd care; as if he'd make money on software anyways
[18:30:45] <gerikson> "sell support"
[18:30:54] <cb> talk about a perverse incentive
[18:31:03] <gerikson> except support is basically a race to the bottom if anyone has access to the source
[18:31:13] <quanticle> Well, no, Stallman had an idea for how free software was going to be economically sustainable; it's just that his idea presumed that distribution would remain expensive.
[18:31:17] <quanticle> Then the Internet happens
[18:31:22] <quanticle> Distribution costs fall to 0
[18:31:28] <gerikson> quanticle: excellent point
[18:32:16] <quanticle> In Stallman's original vision, you buy emacs as boxed software
[18:32:27] <quanticle> And that box *also* includes the source code
[18:32:46] <gerikson> it would be a very big box ;)
[18:32:55] <quanticle> Well, the box can contain floppies
[18:33:00] <quanticle> Or CDs as the case may be
[18:33:29] <quanticle> And in that world, free software actually has a *more* compelling economic model than proprietary
[18:33:44] <quanticle> Because free software can sustain an entire *ecosystem* of mods and patches
[18:33:50] <quanticle> Which are themselves sold
[18:33:58] <quanticle> (Because distribution costs are > 0)
[18:34:14] *** Joins: dmc (~dmc@archlinux/trusteduser/polyzen)
[18:34:41] <companion_cube> if people were to snailmail patches on CDs, you mean? wow
[18:35:06] <quanticle> Well more like you know how you can buy third-party addons for e.g. Photoshop?
[18:35:09] <quanticle> Like that
[18:35:12] <quanticle> But for emacs
[18:35:26] <quanticle> And because emacs is open source, third party addons are easier to develop
[18:35:43] <companion_cube> I guess people would actually pay for magit
[18:35:48] <quanticle> Exactly!
[18:35:51] <quanticle> And org-mode
[18:36:03] <companion_cube> funny though, it's a world that is entirely foreign in 2021
[18:36:09] <companion_cube> distribution is incredibly cheap :/
[18:36:28] <quanticle> Yep, Stallman failed to anticipate how the Internet would completely change everything
[18:36:30] <companion_cube> people re-download hundreds of megabytes of dependency _at each commit_ for CI
[18:36:35] <quanticle> To be fair, though, he wasn't the only one
[18:36:40] <gerikson> call me crazy but maybe being ensconced in the warm embrace of an MIT office does keep you a bit cut off from the world
[18:36:54] <companion_cube> ðŸ¤·
[18:37:17] <quanticle> Well that... but also you have to remember that when Stallman came up with GNU and the FSF, Tim Berners Lee's invention was still more than a decade away

[18:37:28] <buttsbot> Imgur: The magic of the Internet

[18:38:03] <gerikson> nice clouds Brekkjern
[18:38:35] <Brekkjern> It was honestly pretty nice to get out of the heat for a few days :P
[18:38:48] <gerikson> quanticle: leaving Stallman aside, it's a bit embarrasing how many of his acolytes *also* seem to view the world, ca 1988
[18:38:56] <gerikson> Brekkjern: some fjell, seomwher?
[18:39:08] <Brekkjern> Hovden, Bykle
[18:39:22] <quanticle> Yeah, absolutely no excuse for that. Stallman himself, though? Well, he's like Chomsky. He developed his worldview in 1975 and by God he's sticking to it!
[18:39:36] <companion_cube> we probably all do that
[18:39:42] <companion_cube> but not as publicly visibly
[18:39:49] <gerikson> ``Bykle and Hovden, the northernmost part of Setesdal;;
[18:40:00] <gerikson> this might as well be Middle Earth ;)
[18:40:04] <Brekkjern> Yep

[18:40:28] <Brekkjern> Took us about 5 hours by bus
[18:40:56] <gerikson> not too bad
[18:41:08] <Brekkjern> Prolly takes 30-60 hours shorter by car depending on traffic or road closures
[18:41:24] <Brekkjern> Err
[18:41:28] <Brekkjern> Not hours...
[18:41:46] <gerikson> Norwegian cars
[18:41:50] <gerikson> still pulled by horses
[18:41:55] <Brekkjern> Hah
[18:42:24] <Brekkjern> There is still snow up in the peaks here
[18:42:37] <gerikson> cool
[18:42:38] <gerikson> literally
[18:42:48] <Brekkjern> When I left Oslo it was 25c and torrential rain
[18:43:13] <Brekkjern> It was so damn hot and humid I thought I would die from overheating
[18:44:04] <quanticle> Man, it hit 36ÂºC here a few days ago
[18:44:13] <quanticle> And now it's like 15ÂºC
[18:44:22] <Brekkjern> 15C was glorious
[18:44:34] <quanticle> Minnesota weather is always variable, but... I feel like this year has been more variable than most.
[18:44:35] <Brekkjern> I love cold weather
[18:46:07] <Brekkjern> Its been raining more or less all the time here and I have loved it :P
[18:50:44] <Brekkjern> Just lying about on a sofa and reading a book. Going for walks when the rain permitted :P
[18:55:12] <cb> minnesota is full of norwegians and swedes that migrated to somewhere where the climate is identical to their ancestral homeland
