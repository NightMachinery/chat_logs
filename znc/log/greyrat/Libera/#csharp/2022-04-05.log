[00:06:11] <bomb> that's how many programming languages started. "let's hack some shit together" BAM! industry standard
[00:06:29] <JakeSays> these days there's a million to choose from, but back then the only good embeddable language toolkits cost a fortune

[01:26:36] <JakeSays> huh. that one looks close
[01:26:55] <JakeSays> it has 3 channels
[01:27:21] <brianonymous_> 0-30v x2.. and a 2.5, 3.3, 5v 3rd
[01:27:26] <brianonymous_> which is perfect for what i want
[01:27:35] <JakeSays> right
[01:27:37] <brianonymous_> i researched the shit out of supplies
[01:27:52] <JakeSays> excellent. now i don't have to.
[01:28:16] <brianonymous_> i *almost* got a rigol 832A
[01:28:34] <brianonymous_> if you want to do individual channels, look at KORAD
[01:28:52] <JakeSays> what i'd love is something with like 32 channels
[01:29:56] <JakeSays> well, i'd like to do away with the dozen wall warts i have on my desk
[01:31:09] <brianonymous_> lol
[01:31:24] <brianonymous_> the good part of all of the ones ive listed is they are all linear supplies
[01:31:29] <brianonymous_> super, super low noise
[01:31:53] <brianonymous_> i saw oscope captures of the cheaper switching supplies, omfg
[01:32:04] <JakeSays> i'd like to build a bench supply with like 12 selectable ports
[01:32:39] <brianonymous_> how much you pay all centers around how clean you need it.. you could build that 12 in switch mode pretty easy beans
[01:32:43] <JakeSays> most everything i've been working with has built in regulators, but i'd like to change that
[01:32:46] <brianonymous_> but it will be noisy
[01:32:51] <JakeSays> right
[01:33:24] <JakeSays> i've had issues that i'm convinced are noisy power related
[01:33:28] <brianonymous_> yes
[01:34:05] <brianonymous_> i can now say the lab build has officially... begun *gong*
[01:34:14] <JakeSays> i'd also love to have a logic analyzer that can display captures in near-real time
[01:34:22] <JakeSays> LOL cool!
[01:34:35] <brianonymous_> these days digital oscopes are cheap as balls.. until you start needing past 100mhz
[01:34:44] <JakeSays> right
[01:34:56] <brianonymous_> a mixed mode oscope is next on my list
[01:35:04] <brianonymous_> i dont have my tektronix anymore
[01:35:11] <JakeSays> i have a cheap analyzer that can hit 200mhz, but the company sucks
[01:35:45] <JakeSays> i dont know what happened to my tek. i think 'ex 2 go to it
[01:36:04] <JakeSays> but i got it in '93
[01:36:10] <JakeSays> and it was used then
[01:36:52] <brianonymous_> yeah, same story with mine.. my wife hated how big it was (twss) and some cap inside it was dying
[01:36:57] <brianonymous_> so i let it go
[01:37:04] <brianonymous_> but im HAPPY to replace it with modern

[01:37:32] <brianonymous_> and im willing to go hardcore mode on this one

[03:30:05] <merced> you can use wine on mac
[03:30:07] <bpmedley> DevJohnC : Is MAUI a hard pass because of it's mobile heritage or something else?
[03:30:28] <bpmedley> merced : I have not tried packaging wine lately for a single app deployment.
[03:30:32] <JakeSays> merced: hell if winforms was rock solid on linux (as in a linux port, not wine) i'd be all over it
[03:30:47] <merced> JakeSays++
[03:30:48] <DoofusCanadensis> why tho?
[03:31:05] <JakeSays> DoofusCanadensis: why what?
[03:31:09] <merced> JakeSays: we're deploying one of our Win32/C++/MFC apps on WINE cuz it uses 1998 MFC
[03:31:14] <merced> and it's more stable than running on windows
[03:31:14] <DoofusCanadensis> use wine on macOS
[03:31:23] <JakeSays> merced: LOL
[03:31:25] <bpmedley> JakeSays : I've read they may consider Linux support after the initial MAUI release.  Although, I read that some time ago..
[03:31:47] <merced> JakeSays: ;)
[03:31:52] <JakeSays> DoofusCanadensis: well, if you need a windows app running on osux wine is only one of two options
[03:32:30] <bpmedley> DoofusCanadensis : I have seen some initial support for Xamarin Forms desktop, however, I have seen nothing substantial after the initial release a while back.
[03:32:36] <JakeSays> bpmedley: well, they're working on a maui renderer (aka skia based renderer) so once that's done then a port to linux would be trivial
[03:32:58] <JakeSays> *if it's ever finished

[03:34:13] <merced> its a WIP so we havent gotten to the "packaging" part yet
[03:34:25] <DoofusCanadensis> JakeSays: macOS
[03:34:41] <bpmedley> merced : Understood, thanks.  I wonder if WPF works in macOS and Linux in wine.
[03:34:42] <JakeSays> DoofusCanadensis: what?
[03:35:00] <bpmedley> Did I miss any messages sent my way?
[03:35:18] <JakeSays> bpmedley: supposedly wpf used to work but never reliably
[03:35:32] <DoofusCanadensis> I thought wine was an emulation for Linux. Didn't know they did a port to Unix as well
[03:35:34] <merced> bpmedley: yeah ive never had much luck with WPF in wine
[03:35:42] <merced> DoofusCanadensis: WINE stands for "WINE is not an emulator"
[03:35:44] <JakeSays> also even though wine works, running a windows app on linux is not a pleasant experience
[03:36:05] <merced> its a lot better now at least
[03:36:14] <bpmedley> merced : Thanks.  Have you seen this company?  https://www.codeweavers.com/
[03:36:14] <JakeSays> DoofusCanadensis: wine is not an emulator
[03:36:17] <merced> i can play a lot of games on FreeBSD that i couldn't before
[03:36:17] <DoofusCanadensis> shouldn't that be WINEA?
[03:36:24] <DoofusCanadensis> err. WINAE?
[03:36:39] <merced> bpmedley: codeweavers just packaged WINE into a sellable package, but they're pretty good
[03:36:49] <merced> cuz it _does_ take time to configure wine right to run an app
[03:37:03] <bpmedley> merced : In the past, I think they had some customizations.
[03:37:08] <JakeSays> i don't like running windows apps on linux.
[03:37:17] <DoofusCanadensis> I know somebody who spent a lot of time getting Fallout: New Vegas running on Linux with wine
[03:37:26] <merced> did they suceed?
[03:37:34] <DoofusCanadensis> I believe so

[12:59:09] <smallville7123> why isnt this a const expresion?        const ushort[] __rsqrt_tab = { 0xb451, 0xb2f0 };
[13:02:41] <canton7> Well, 1) because there are only a small number of types which can be consts, and arrays aren't one of them, 2) Arrays are mutable. If that were allowed, you'd be able to do '__rsqrt_tab[0] = 0', and 3) A const reference type makes no sense anyway. The point of const is to insert the value directly into the use site
[13:04:03] <smallville7123> is there a way to specify a const array without using `static readonly`
[13:04:50] <smallville7123> or is `static readonly` sufficent in all cases of `const`
[13:04:59] <canton7> What exactly do you mean by "a const array"? Do you mean immutable, so someone can't do 'arr[0] = 0'? Do you mean "const" as in the keyword, meaning that the value is baked into the use site? Do you mean "readonly", in that someone can't do "arr = new ..."?
[13:05:20] <smallville7123> immutable array
[13:05:26] <canton7> Note that C++'s const semantics don't apply to C#
[13:06:02] <canton7> Arrays are mutable. If you want an immutable array, so someone can't do 'arr[0] = 0', you need a different data type. You could use an `IReadOnlyList<T>`, or a `Span<T>'
[13:06:15] <canton7> If you want to stop someone re-assigning it, you'll want to make it readonly
[13:06:30] <smallville7123> alright
[13:06:48] <bomb> smallville is a traitor! he codes Java!
[13:06:52] <smallville7123> imma just keep it as `static readonly ushort[] __rsqrt_tab`
[13:07:09] <smallville7123> bomb: lol
[13:07:17] <canton7> smallville7123, note that someone can still do '__rsqrt_tab[0] = 0' from anywhere in code -- so that breaks your requirement for it to be immutable
[13:07:25] <canton7> You could also use an `ImmutableArray<T>', of course
[13:08:07] <smallville7123> so `readonly` on an array only makes the array variable itself non assignable?
[13:09:03] <canton7> Yes. Same with any type. "readonly" only means that you can't re-assign it. Like I said, C# doesn't have C++'s const semantics
[13:09:18] <smallville7123> eg on a non-array type that can be changed but not reassigned this is the same as "const" ?

[13:09:47] <canton7> Hmm?

[13:10:23] <canton7> 'class A { int X { get; set; } }' and 'readonly A A = new()'. Someone can do 'A.X = 3', but they can't do 'A = new()'
[13:10:33] <smallville7123> yea
[13:13:10] <canton7> (Things get a bit more tricky if 'A' is a struct, rather than a class)
[13:13:25] <smallville7123> does `readonly` make any difference if the variable is private only to the code that uses it and the code does not modify such variable?
[13:14:18] <canton7> `readonly` stops you from re-assigning the member/variable
[13:14:43] *** Quits: inceptionflywho (~cloaker@user/cloaker) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[13:14:48] <canton7> I'm not sure what you're asking beyond that. If something doesn't attempt to re-assign a 'readonly' variable, then you have code while compiles
[13:15:22] <canton7> *code which compiles
[13:15:24] <smallville7123> like if it is known that the variable is never modified in any way, only accessed, then is `readonly` required?
[13:15:46] <teegee> how to you guys manage application states and UI element states like buttons that are enabled/disabled based on the application's state?
[13:16:10] <canton7> That's a bit tautological, surely? You will *only* have compiling code if it doesn't attempt to re-assign readonly variablkes

[13:17:41] <canton7> I mean, you could argue that 'readonly' is pointless, since your code only compiles if noone is attempting to re-assign a readonly variable, so you could just take out all of the readonlys and nothing would change
[13:18:01] <Babbage> hey
[13:18:23] <smallville7123> or rather a System.Collections.Generic.List<T> ?
[13:18:43] <Andrio> And while you're at it, you can make everything public.
[13:18:44] <canton7> What do you mean?
[13:19:43] <Andrio> If you're defining something with a [ ] initialiser or suffix, it *is* an array. It's not a List; that's a specific data structure that uses an array behind the scenes.
[13:20:39] <teegee> smallville7123: A desktop application may have various buttons that make the application do stuff. it's working towards a final result. At times, some buttons might get disabled because their function is not available at that time. The application, on its way towards that result, could be considered going through various states. There has to be a
[13:20:40] <teegee> better way than 10 boolean flags and a combination of and and or to control the button disabled state

[13:21:19] <canton7> teegee, if I'm interpreting what you mean correctly... I'd had domain objects publish a 'State' object. A 'State' object consists of a number of classes which all implement a comment interface, with one class per state. Each class has state-specific members on it. When the domain publishes a new state, the ViewModel(s) which render that state look
[13:21:19] <canton7> to see what 'State' class it is, and update themselves accordingly, using that state-specific data as necessary
[13:21:37] <canton7> (I used the visitor pattern on the state objects, but that's not mandatory)
[13:22:29] <smallville7123> teegee: so basically, it is equvilant to
[13:22:29] <dan01> Anyone here using DataGrip
[13:22:41] <teegee> yep. I've gone the same way with a state object, however less involved so far

[13:24:53] <smallville7123> (as it is very CPU expensive)
[13:25:14] <teegee> that's basically checking boolean flags, smallville7123
[13:25:28] <smallville7123> (depending on how fast C# is capable of itterating a while(true) loop)
[13:25:34] <smallville7123> teegee: yea

[13:26:38] <canton7> entropygain, ^
[13:27:00] <teegee> :)
[13:27:15] <canton7> Then SomeViewModel subscribes to the relevant domain object, and OnStateChanged is called when that domain object's state changes
[13:27:34] <smallville7123> as to be able to define "a better way" we need to know better how your code works in relation to your question, and the above is the best i can interperate it

[13:30:19] <teegee> canton7: I played with the idea of implementing a statemachine so that I have control over the state transitions in a controlled manner. Then have the state machine update a state object which holds the properties of the UI elements in question with the UI elements watching the state object
[13:30:47] <smallville7123> tho regardless of the implementation, i would probs just use callbacks that get invoked when such data is "ready"
[13:31:12] <alguien> smallville7123, how did unions go?
[13:32:11] <smallville7123> eg     compute_data( new Callback(my_button, b => b.enable()) ); // this callback gets called when compute_data has finished computing its data
[13:32:22] <smallville7123> the same can be applied anywhere else
[13:32:28] <canton7> teegee, yeah, I'd have state machines knocking around in the domain layer for that sort of thing
[13:32:46] <smallville7123> also assuming Action<Button> as the second arg for Callback
[13:33:21] <smallville7123> (i think, i forget how exactly to pass arguments with callbacks)
[13:34:15] <smallville7123> but i would assume Callback(Button b, Action<Button> a); and then callback.a.Invoke(callback.b);
[13:34:24] <canton7> You're using a callback to be notified when an asynchronous operation is complete?
[13:34:30] <smallville7123> yes
[13:34:48] <smallville7123> ideally you would also ensure this runs on the UI thread if needed
[13:35:01] <canton7> I don't think that's what teegee's talking about, and C# uses async/await for that anyway
[13:35:30] <smallville7123> still, it can be applied to non asynchronous operations too
[13:35:33] <canton7> We dropped the callback-based pattern about a decade ago
[13:36:17] <smallville7123> canton7: for onstatechange ?
[13:36:51] <teegee> I also use commanding instead of b.enable()
[13:37:15] <smallville7123> teegee: still, whatever enables the button itself is what you would call
[13:37:20] <smallville7123> :)
[13:37:56] <canton7> smallville7123, 'onstatechange' meaning subscribing to an event? We typically use events, or some other similar system. But you wouldn't make the thing you're subscribing to aware that you're updating a Button -- that's UI-level knowledge, and the thing you're subscribing to doesn't need to know that
[13:37:59] <smallville7123> "[19:05] <canton7> We dropped the callback-based pattern about a decade ago" because they leak if the callback is not removed when the object is GC'd ?
[13:38:23] <canton7> smallville7123, because it's a PITA -- callback-based control flow is hard to follow, and things like exception handling is hard
[13:38:35] <smallville7123> how so?
[13:38:48] <Tobbi_> Morning peasants.
[13:39:02] <canton7> You end up with a bunch of nested/chained callbacks, and extra callbacks to handle exception cases
[13:39:03] <smallville7123> Tobbi_: oof
[13:39:04] <entropygain> canton7: I guess you can have the default Visit implementation in the IApplicationState nowadays too :P
[13:39:16] <Tobbi_> smallville7123: You're right, I shouldn't have said that.
[13:39:20] <Tobbi_> After all, it's not morning anymore.
[13:39:27] <canton7> 'void DoTheThing(OnComplete, OnCancelled, OnError)'. The TPL improved that a bit with Task.ContinueWith, but it was still a mess
[13:39:30] <Tobbi_> good noon, peasants.
[13:39:33] <smallville7123> canton7: hmm alright
[13:40:06] <canton7> entropygain, you can, but I like the fact that I'm forced to update all consumers whenever a new state is added. If I didn't care about that, I'd just use a switch statement in the VM
[13:41:14] <entropygain> Is see.. to sanity check yourself each time?
[13:41:18] <canton7> (DU's / closed class hierarchies would be a better solution... If and when they ever arrive)
[13:41:55] <canton7> entropygain, yeah, I want to make sure that all of the VMs are properly updated to handle new states. If I was able to add a new state and forget to update a VM which attempts to display it, then I'd have part of the application which just showed the wrong thing when the app was in that state
[13:42:15] <canton7> I like having the compiler watch my back

[13:47:39] <teegee> thanks for the inspiration, canton7
[13:48:17] <canton7> No worries, hopefully it's useful. That general pattern has worked well for me in the past
[13:49:03] <canton7> You can start playing around a bit with it as well -- if you have some states which share a bunch of common properties then put them on an extra interface, then your VMs can do 'if (state is ICommonWhatever x)' in a central place, and don't need to repeat that logic for each of those states
[13:49:33] <teegee> 👍
[13:50:06] <canton7> Also make the state objects immutable. Representing your domain state as immutable objects which are published is really powerful, as you don't need to worry about thread-safety: just chuck the latest state over the fence, and all of the consumers can read it from whatever thread they like

[13:53:53] <canton7> Also don't worry about incrementally updating the state or anything -- just publish the latest and greatest state, in its entirety. The consumer can check whether some property has changed if they care, but most of the time they don't. VMs can just set all of the properties according to the new state, and your INPC implementation should take care
[13:53:53] <canton7> of only raising PropertyChanged events to the UI if a property has actually changed

[17:10:05] <smallville7123>  is it normal for 700 to be converted to a float instead of a double when passed to a method accepting either a float or a double

[17:20:49] <canton7> 'float' is a *better conversion target* for an integer literal than a double because there exists an implicit conversion from float to double

[17:38:26] <jmer> canton7: Is this because that using Tasks doesn't necessarily mean you get a new thread, thus it would require async/await stuff to try and reprioritize the main thread?
[17:40:05] <jmer> MatthiasVance: This is for running various "jobs". So I htink we will end up getting our intern to write something for us that can be run in it's own process instead of sharing a process with the webserver. THe reasoning is to make sure these "jobs" don't make the webshop slow.
[17:40:54] <jmer> I think I might just send him a link to Quartz.net or something similar

[18:32:17] <bpmedley> jmer : I have a smallish custom TaskScheduler that hackishly runs a task on a new Thread.  I would not run in development nor production.  Let me know if you want the code.. :-)
[18:32:53] <jmer> bpmedley: Thanks, but no thanks. I will get our intern to whip up something based on Quartz.net and then we can set that overall process CPU priority and handle it that way.
[18:33:09] <bpmedley> That feels like a more elegant solution, jmer
[18:33:18] <jmer> or maybe move it to it's own VM/App Service
