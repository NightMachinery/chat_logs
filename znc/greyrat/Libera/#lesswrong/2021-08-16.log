[01:38:21] <two2thehead> "This study examined Big Five and Dark Tetrad personality perception for 56 characters from the popular TV show Game of Thrones‚Äîand the book series that inspired it, A Song of Ice and Fire‚Äîby 309 fans recruited from three relevant subreddits. Specifically, we examined consensus‚Äîthe extent to which multiple perceivers (participants) rate one or more targets (characters) similarly‚Äîand projection (a.k.a. assumed similarity)‚Äîthe 
[01:38:22] <two2thehead> extent to which perceivers (participants) see targets (characters) as they see themselves. Using cross-classified structural equation models (CC-SEMs), we found that consensus correlations were significant for all Big Five and Dark Tetrad traits, ranging from .54 for narcissism to .83 for agreeableness (M = .66, SD = .10). Projection slopes were positive (range: 0.07 to 0.29; M = 0.15, SD = 0.06) and significant for all traits except 
[01:38:22] <two2thehead> conscientiousness and open-mindedness. Thus, raters reliably assumed that characters were similar to themselves on 7 of 9 traits. Exploratory sex-differences analyses showed no sex-of-character effects, but significant sex-of-perceiver effects for conscientiousness, open-mindedness, and Machiavellianism; women perceived characters to be higher on these traits than men. In addition, women (vs. men) rated themselves as higher on extraversion, 
[01:38:28] <two2thehead> agreeableness, and conscientiousness, but lower on Machiavellianism. We also present rankings for characters with the highest and lowest scores on each trait. Broadly, this work is important not only for understanding how our perceptions of personality generalize to fictional characters, but also how we use fiction characters‚Äîand our perceptions of their personalities‚Äîto better understand our own social world."

[06:19:48] <ggreer> one interesting advantage of appendix carry: drawing is significantly faster than strong side hip carry. you use your non-dominant hand to clear garments while reaching with your dominant hand to grab the pistol. with training, you can draw and get an aimed shot off in less than a second
[06:22:23] <adiabatic> that _is_ interesting
[06:25:21] <ggreer> carrying in this position was extremely controversial until maybe 10 years ago. older gun models aren't as safe (eg: no firing pin block, less drop testing) and older holsters were usually made of leather (which can deform over time and end up catching the trigger when you reholster)

The Afghan government would have still collapsed, it would have just done so more slowly (and probably with more American deaths). By

[08:13:24] <rmmh> gwern: using a weapon on yourself is dangerous, yes
[08:13:35] <rmmh> but headbutting rocks isn't interesting
[08:13:47] <quanticle> Wingsuit BASE jumping and cave diving are the most dangerous activities that people do, period. Nothing else even comes close to the fatality rates of those two activities. Weirdly enough, they're both variants of activities (wingsuit skydiving and regular scuba diving) that are both considered pretty safe.  
[08:14:01] <gwern> 'More than 4,000 people have climbed Mount Everest, but fewer than 200 have done so without oxygen.' hm. wonder how many of those are sherpas. they have a lower deathrate

[08:15:58] <shawwwn> that's metal
[08:16:14] <shawwwn> more like mount metal

[08:19:42] <shawwwn> yis
[08:19:48] <quanticle> Wow, I didn't realize mountaineering had such a ridiculous fatality rate. Does raise the question, though, of why Everest exeditions exist. After all, by your own logic, with a fatality rate that high, it really shouldn't.
[08:20:26] <adiabatic> quanticle: did you see that one Star Trek movie, Mr. Spock?

[08:21:25] <quanticle> Is that the one where Kirk is trying to free-solo a cliff and falls?
[08:23:05] <quanticle> Actually, that's a good candidate: free-solo climbing. I remember reading, after Alex Honnold's free solo of El Capitan, that some ridiculous number of prominent free-solo climbers had died while climbing.
[08:23:18] <gwern> true, but only collectively, over many free-solos
[08:23:24] <feep> because even lawmakers don't want to concede to a mountain
[08:24:23] <gwern> when you are a 'free-solo climber', you need to at least live long enough to free-solo more than a handful of routes, after all. there's an inherent selection effect. a *single* route can be arbitrarily fatal, like el capitan. but they can't be too fatal on average or else there wouldn't be anyone doing it for long
[08:24:35] <adiabatic> quanticle: yes, that one
[08:25:54] <gwern> (now the interesting question here is, how often do the sherpas summit everest? if anyone could have low enough mortality rates to reasonably make 'climbing mount everest' sport-able instead of a one-off stunt you never do again, it's them)

[08:28:35] <rmmh> what the _fuck_ yalung kang kills 75%+ of climbers
[08:28:38] <gwern> 'And for all climbs above base camp in the region, the death rate has dropped from 3% in the 1950s to 0.9% over the past decade. For Sherpas, the Nepalese professional climbers hired to support mountaineering teams, it has declined from 1.3% to 0.8%.' hm
[08:28:51] <quanticle> Anyway, rmmh's original question was, what's the most dangerous activity, not the most dangerous sport, so I guess it's climbing Mount Everest. Although... doesn't K2 have a higher death percentage than Everest? But I guess if you want to zoom out just a bit, "Climbing Himalayan mountains" would be a good description.
[08:29:00] <gwern> rmmh: and now you know one reason why you don't hear people boasting about going to climb yalung kang
[08:29:11] <rmmh> truly, dead men tell no tales
[08:29:19] <shawwwn> technically shooting yourself in the head is one of the most dangerous activities that people partake in
[08:29:29] <rmmh> "suicide attempts"
[08:29:36] <gwern> shawwwn: yeah, but the energy comes from the gunpowder. hence my airgun example
[08:29:40] <rmmh> is 75% fatality rate higher than most suicide attempts

[08:29:55] <rmmh> "depends on if you're a woman"
[08:30:09] <gwern> shawwwn: airguns have a surprisingly long history because they let you trade manual labor for gunpowder

[08:37:58] <shawwwn> not if you build the blade in midair
[08:40:18] <quanticle> Gravity doesn't provide any energy in a guillotine. It converts the potential energy of the raised blade into the kinetic energy of the falling blade. The energy of the blade (minus friction and air resistance) remains constant throughout its travel, until it is dissipated in the impact with the person's neck.
[08:41:18] <shawwwn> you have to build the blade in midair
[08:43:08] <shawwwn> one way to do that is to build it on a mountain, then roll it off the side
[08:43:20] <quanticle> What does building the blade in midair get you? You still have to raise the components off the ground, somehow. Unless... okay, hear me out: you don't build the blade in mid-air, you build it in *space*, from asteroid metal. Then you give it a very precise nudge and it falls onto your victim.
[08:43:50] <shawwwn> we were thinking along the same lines. but I submit that a mountain is slightly easier 
[08:43:54] <adiabatic> isn't that what the Empire of Man does? Except they use the whole asteroid, and don't re-form anything into a guillotine shape?
[08:43:56] <shawwwn> watch out for the 10% fatality rate though

[08:44:16] <gwern> just means more D-class personnel
[08:45:06] <quanticle> Well, only if the mountain has iron deposits in it that you can use. But yeah, that could work. But counterpoint: space guillotines are way cooler
[08:46:04] <shawwwn> that's true

[09:35:41] <MrFantastik> I am doing some searching rn and one comment on hackernews suggests increasing your vocabulary helps
[09:35:44] <MrFantastik> makes sense to me
[09:37:46] <MrFantastik> > Reading speed is a vanity metric. No one cares how fast you read or how many books you read last year. In the real world what matters is what you absorb.
[09:37:50] <rsaarelm> MrFantastik: I wished for something like that but haven't managed anything. Current thought is that this is a work-smarter-not-harder thing.
[09:38:05] <rsaarelm> Ie, material-dependent skimming techniques, not working on raw reading speed.
[09:38:25] <MrFantastik> yea I'm guessing reading speed may be akin to something like muscle size
[09:38:38] <MrFantastik> where it comes from exercise 
[09:38:41] <rsaarelm> So you want to think about what it is you're actually trying to accomplish by reading and figure out ways to get more efficient with it.
[09:38:59] <rsaarelm> (Do you have something more specific you're actually trying to accomplish?)
[09:39:07] <adiabatic> yeah, what I really want is to be able to remember what the heck I read in six months or six years
[09:39:31] <MrFantastik> in order to remember stuff I'll take notes or add it to anki
[09:39:59] <rsaarelm> Example for working smarter when you're reading something like academic history books: https://savageminds.org/2007/10/01/how-to-read-a-good-book-in-one-hour/
[09:40:00] <Robomot> How to read a (good) book in one hour.  | Savage Minds
[09:40:00] <adiabatic> I've been able to help people out by referring back to my notes and the stuff I read in _The Obesity Code_, but I'd like to be able to do that without reading the book a second time and taking notes
[09:40:03] <MrFantastik> I'm just trying to be able to read it faster, if I could double my reading speed somehow I'd really like that
[09:41:02] <MrFantastik> double it while maintaining comphrehension of course
[09:41:26] <MrFantastik> maybe that post was right, this is kind of vanity thing 
[09:42:14] <rsaarelm> "Remember what I read" still sounds a bit like evading the more precise description. Do you have a research program? What is it? Do you not have one? Then you're reading for exploration instead of exploitation. You make maps when exploring, you make designs and plans when exploiting.
[09:43:13] <rsaarelm> MrFantastik: What's your reading speed now, roughly?
[09:43:17] <MrFantastik> I read for both 
[09:43:49] <MrFantastik> i took a test on readingsoft.com and got 400 wpm with 64% comprehension
[09:44:04] <rsaarelm> There are wins for low reading speeds, like not vocalizing the words, but I'm not sure how many people have that problem.

[09:44:59] <shawwwn> I vocalize everything I read
[09:46:57] <MrFantastik> i feel like increaseing both reading and comprhension are both good meta skills to have
[09:47:18] <shawwwn> meta stands for most effective tactic available btw
[09:47:32] <MrFantastik> oh really?
[09:47:35] <shawwwn> it was a bit mindblowing
[09:47:35] <PapuaHardyNet> MrFantastik: anki is the best when it comes to ensuring you remember what you read
[09:47:49] <MrFantastik> I use it :)
[09:47:52] <PapuaHardyNet> aw come on, that's a backronym
[09:47:55] <shawwwn> yeah apparently when you learn the meta, you're learning the most effective tactic available
[09:47:56] <MrFantastik> I love it too its like a super power
[09:48:23] <PapuaHardyNet> even better is that when using anki, you are encouraged by the design of the flashcards to break down your understanding of the topic into simple elements
[09:48:24] <MrFantastik> i have always thought of meta in that context as second order or n ordered strategy
[09:48:34] <adiabatic> that's hella a made-up acronym
[09:48:35] <rsaarelm> Got 427 / 100 % comprehension from the test, pretty much the same speed.
[09:48:42] <adiabatic> "meta" just means "popular", not always the best
[09:48:50] <PapuaHardyNet> that is super useful for ensuring that you actually undesrtand the topic instead of using "guess the teacher's password" style understanding
[09:48:55] <adiabatic> especially in domains when the best isn't widely agreed upon
[09:49:25] <MrFantastik> PapuaHardyNet: the best way I've found to gain understanding is by doing 
[09:49:25] <rsaarelm> adiabatic: That sounds like your standard biomedicine master's thesis project, so whatever those guys already do/
[09:49:27] <rsaarelm> ?
[09:49:29] <MrFantastik> for me
[09:49:44] <adiabatic> rsaarelm: sorry, I don't know any biomedicine people
[09:50:01] <adiabatic> something like "take it all in and remember the useful things"
[09:50:44] <rsaarelm> adiabatic: Okay so is this a meta question about how what I said about research programs is unclear or do you want me to actually start brainstorming obesity research with you?
[09:50:56] <adiabatic> rsaarelm: the former

[09:51:47] <MrFantastik> this looks promising
[09:52:23] <rsaarelm> adiabatic:  I mean "try to figure out how your average university undergraduate would get around to doing this thing if it sounds like a master's thesis program" feels sorta obvious to me, and undergrads are pretty stupid so you don't need special domain knowledge. You can start with the 101 textbooks of the field.
[09:52:42] <rsaarelm> Yeah, that one's a classic.
[09:52:50] <rsaarelm> Another one for the "work smarter" thing.
[09:54:28] <rsaarelm> MrFantastik: Also, maybe generally cultivate an attitude of not expecting to read any nonfiction book cover-to-cover in order like you would for a fiction book. Just treat them as being for grazing and skimming and trying to grab whatever you're interested in in general, and only read in detail once you establish some book as extra important.

[09:57:02] <rsaarelm> A meta note about reading speed, I see a lot of sales pitches from companies, like the one readingsoft cleverly makes you read as the comprehension test, but I see basically zero impressive smart people, commenters at lesswrong or Hacker News or whatnot ever saying anything in lines of "I got where I did because I worked hard to double my reading speed in my twenties".
[09:57:12] <MrFantastik> I often go one step further and not read anything at all
[09:57:30] <MrFantastik> hehe
[09:57:47] <rsaarelm> *Or* "I've gotten reasonably far but as I get older it's obvious I'm being held back by my mediocre reading speed and the people who get ahead of me can read 2x or 3x as fast"
[09:58:20] <nshepperd> 'meta' in that sense is short for metagame
[09:58:26] <rsaarelm> Yeah.
[09:58:38] <rsaarelm> I think this is sorta important, not just a joke.
[09:59:05] <rsaarelm> I got a sense that this thing doesn't actually matter much, once you're in the baseline-okay 300-500 WPM reading range.
[09:59:45] <MrFantastik> I think I agree, but I did want to explore a quantified way to try and increase those numbers though
[10:00:35] <MrFantastik> there are some exercises i do for chess that increased my elo by like 25% 
[10:00:36] <rsaarelm> Yeah, it's worth a shot to see if you can actually get some wins in stuff you do a lot.

[10:03:15] <rsaarelm> I was just in the middle of reading David Epstein's Range that's about how sports and chess (where the 10k hours of practice thing was derived from) are probably a bad model for most human skilled endeavor, because strictly in-the-box activities like that are anomalous, even though they're nice and quantifiable.
[10:04:07] <MrFantastik> I think participation in both sports and chess have plenty of transferable skills though
[10:04:22] <MrFantastik> but I'll check that out
[10:04:56] <MrFantastik> I think that locker room drama shit helped prepare me to work in stressful team environmments and stuff
[10:05:03] <rsaarelm> So people feel like they can extend the sort of scientific coaching attitude that gets great results when you start teaching a 3 year old golf or violin and apply it to making scientists or entrepreneurs or scholars, and it doesn't work out that well because those fields need open-ended problem solving and breakout successes tend to involve out of the box thinking instead of just excellently
[10:05:05] <rsaarelm> hyperoptimized performance within imposed parameters.
[10:05:20] <MrFantastik> like having teammates that i didn't always get a long with, but both of us having mutual goals 
[10:06:08] <MrFantastik> once something becomes a metric it ceases being useful 
[10:06:20] <MrFantastik> idk exactly the credit on that concept
[10:06:46] <rsaarelm> Goodhart's law
[10:06:58] <MrFantastik> yea i kind of hate measuring stuff about myself because I'm afraid of how it will effect my behavior
[10:07:07] <MrFantastik> I'm an imperfect observer of that info too
[10:07:37] <quanticle> >I think participation in both sports and chess have plenty of transferable skills though
[10:07:38] <MrFantastik> I did sentimennt analysis on my diary and I'm pretty sure that was a mistake
[10:07:40] <quanticle> Hasn't the chess bit been pretty conclusively disproven? People who are good at chess tend to be good at other things because they're smart people, not because they picked up some specific skills from chess and applied them to other problem domains.
[10:08:08] <MrFantastik> Lessons I get from chess are stuff like its a good idea to prepare for stuff, sometimes I can be wrong and still win
[10:08:13] <rsaarelm> I think the beeminder / don't-break-the-streak style self-measuring is fine. Which is basically just "1 did [duration] of [thing] today"
[10:08:37] <MrFantastik> sometimes a bad move is better than in action 
[10:08:57] <rsaarelm> And then you're a world grandmaster of chess and believe the illuminati faked the first millennium CE of history.
[10:09:03] <MrFantastik> but its really heuristics based stuff, none of the things that make me singly good at chess are useful
[10:09:09] <MrFantastik> also im not that good
[10:09:16] <PapuaHardyNet> MrFantastik: please talk about how it was a mistake to do sentiment analysis of your diary
[10:09:35] <quanticle> Fair enough, but you can learn those lessons from a lot of places, not just chess. It's not like chess, specifically will teach you the value of preparation. I learned to be prepared by having it drilled into me by my experiences in the Boy Scouts.
[10:09:38] <MrFantastik> rsaarelm: i do that rn
[10:09:58] <MrFantastik> with measuring what i did today and how long

Increasing your reading speed won't necessarily help you; it'll just allow you to expand your reading list at a faster rate because you'll look at a book, think, "Yeah, I could read that," and add it to the list.

[10:26:26] <rsaarelm> Titan and Millennium are John Varley I think, I've read first two books of Titan. Alvin Maker is Orson Scott Card's American frontier fantasy stuff.
[10:26:27] <quanticle> notes and getting long-term memory of the steps of reasoning in a book (as opposed to just the book's conclusions) is more valuable than reading fast but having a more shallow comprehension.
[10:27:05] <rsaarelm> John Varley's heyday is 40 years ago, so he'd be obscure now, but I think Alvin Maker is from the 90s?

[10:51:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Appendix N to the 1st Edition of the AD&D Dungeon Master's Guide
[10:51:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: http://www.digital-eel.com/blog/ADnD_reading_list.htm
[10:51:25] <Robomot> AD&D Dungeon Masters Guide - APPENDIX N
[10:51:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Basically, this is "where does D&D come from", trope-wise
[10:53:25] <quanticle> Ah, interesting. Yeah, I scrolled up to the original discussion. I guess I was also under the impression that LotR contributed significantly to the tropes used in D&D, but I guess I was wrong.
[10:54:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> The big difference, and what many people miss (but that is very obvious in retrospect), is that LotR is high fantasy, and D&D ... isn't
[10:54:47] <shawwwn> Hm. is there a way for a sword to cut through a neck so cleanly that the atoms aren't dislodged?
[10:55:11] <quanticle> I never understood the difference between "high-fantasy" and "low-fantasy". Is there a "middle-fantasy"?
[10:55:18] <ggreer> https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html I‚Äôd vote vitalik for god-emperor
[10:55:19] <Robomot> Moving beyond coin voting governance
[10:56:04] <quanticle> I think the only fantasy I've ever read is "high-fantasy", but I could be mistaken. Is, for example, the Amber series also "high-fantasy"?
[10:56:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> D&D is much more "a gang of decidedly shady characters goes rifling through ancient tombs for loot to later pawn off to other, even shadier, characters"
[10:56:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can do high fantasy in D&D, but that's not the default setting, as it were
[10:57:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Amber is definitely high fantasy
[10:57:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Conan, on the other hand, is low fantasy
[10:57:42] <quanticle> Ah, okay. So D&D is more like _The Maltese Falcon_, whereas high-fantasy is more like _Indiana Jones_?
[10:57:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> mmm nah Indiana Jones would not be high fantasy
[10:58:14] <shawwwn> _abc_
[10:58:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Basically, if you can imagine it having a dramatic and extremely serious voiceover by Ian McKellen or someone, it's high fantasy
[10:59:20] * shawwwn hums "don't you think I am the bestest"
[10:59:27] <saturn2> is there a middle fantasy?
[10:59:40] <shawwwn> more like middle-out fantasy
[11:00:04] <quanticle> Okay, so _Red Storm Rising_ would be high fantasy, but _Hunt for the Red October_ wouldn't, lol
[11:00:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... heh
[11:01:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy explains it relatively well
[11:01:13] <Robomot> High Fantasy - TV Tropes (The High Fantasy trope as used in popular culture. The setting of the stereotypical High (or "epic") Fantasy, a collection of tropes, often boiled down from ‚Ä¶)
[11:03:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> See also https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicFantasy
[11:03:01] <Robomot> Heroic Fantasy - TV Tropes (The Heroic Fantasy trope as used in popular culture. The exploits of mighty-thewed, sword-wielding heroes and their thiefly, wizardly and/or priestly ‚Ä¶)
[11:03:51] <quanticle> "Scale: Epic. Power politics, wars, the death of nations, gods walking the earth, and the real threat of The End of the World as We Know It."
[11:03:54] <quanticle> I think this is the key point. LotR, The Amber Chronicles, etc, are distinguished by scenes where literal *armies* over the fate of the world. If you don't have that kind of scale, it's not high-fantasy.
[11:04:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Scale, Morality, and Methods are the big ones imo
[11:05:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, D&D isn't High Fantasy *largely* because High Fantasy pretty much requires plot rails
[11:06:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> If at any point you find that your heroes are kind of fucking around, doing various things for various reasons that don't directly serve your Big Conflict, then your high fantasy is over
[11:06:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> And, accordingly, the most high fantasy D&D setting ever is what? That's right: Dragonlance
[11:07:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is *also* infamous for being the most "plot rails made of adamantine" setting ever
[11:08:00] <quanticle> I would rephrase the "Methods" bit as follows: "Victory is not achieved through force of arms, but rather through an act of moral righteousness conducted by a small group of characters against all odds." The key scene that ensures Sauron's downfall isn't the defeat of his armies, but rather Frodo resisting the urge to put on the ring at the mouth of Mount Doom.
[11:09:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> (i.e. https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2018/12/31/double-booked, where the joke is that what Gabe's doing is *basically* how the actual Dragonlance adventure modules already go)
[11:09:08] <Robomot> Penny Arcade - Comic - Double-Booked (Videogaming-related online strip by Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins. Includes news and commentary.)
[11:09:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Yes, just so
[11:09:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Aside: lol @ the "Creation" section of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonlance 
[11:09:43] <Robomot> Dragonlance - Wikipedia (Dragonlance is a shared universe created by Laura and Tracy Hickman, and expanded by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis under the direction of TSR, Inc. into a series of fantasy novels. The Hickmans conceived Dragonlance while driving in their car on the way to TSR for a job interview. ‚Ä¶)
[11:10:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Hickman developed his world creation technique by writing and self-publishing with his wife Laura the adventure modules Rahasia (1979) and Pharaoh (1980), and writing TSR's Ravenloft module (1983). He was unemployed in 1982, and TSR offered him a job based on his submission of several modules.[2] That year, while driving from Utah to Wisconsin to start a job with TSR, Hickman and his wife created the Dragonlance universe
[11:10:02] <Obormot\Arcturus>  concept. During the trip, Hickman and his wife discussed two ideas they had had for several years: an entire world used to support a storyline, and a world dominated by dragons.[3]
[11:10:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Their ideas were well received by TSR, whose marketing department felt they had enough dungeons, but not enough dragons."
[11:10:29] <saturn2> couldn't you have a big evil villain who is plotting to take over the world slowly?
[11:11:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: You could, but then it wouldn't be high fantasy without some shoehorning
[11:12:23] <rsaarelm> Oh huh, that's exactly what my problem with Alvin Maker was, the whole "He's chosen by God to build New Jerusalem but Satan is alive in the world and creates agents to kill him" sounds like it setting up a high fantasy series and then the books are *very* low/middle fantasy in what actually goes on.
[11:13:20] <quanticle> But yeah, this makes sense. High Fantasy is distinguished by strict morality, high stakes, epic scale, and victory caused by something other than martial force of arms. If you don't have all of those elements, then it's low fantasy. 
[11:13:22] <quanticle> So, I guess under that standard, Red Storm Rising fails the strict morality test, even though it passes all the others. The Soviets are never portrayed as evil; they're portrayed as misguided at best. They try to conquer Western Europe in order to ensure that NATO won't interfere in their attempt to recover oil supplies after an Islamic terrorist attack devastated one of their Siberian oil
[11:13:24] <quanticle> fields. While that's morally wrong, it's not the same category of evil for evil's sake as, say, Sauron.
[11:13:35] <saturn2> they certainly find the time to do a lot of aimless fucking around in LotR
[11:13:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yeah but it's *supposedly* not aimless, it just feels that way
[11:14:29] <quanticle> Yeah, and, if anything, LotR is *good* about limiting the amount of aimless fucking-around. Wheel of Time has entire *books* where the characters do nothing but aimless fucking around.
[11:15:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The series has inspired mention in music as well, including "Wishmaster", a song by Nightwish based partially on the master and apprentice relationship between Raistlin Majere and Dalamar." ... if your setting has symphonic metal songs based on it, it's probably high fantasy
[11:15:38] <rsaarelm> Yeah, LotR doesn't have a side plot where Frodo blows all their cash on hookers and gets indebted to a local mobster and they need to go loot a wight-infested cursed ruin for mystical treasure they can sell to not get wizard assassins sent to collect their testicles.
[11:15:46] <rsaarelm> A low fantasy book totally would.
[11:17:22] <quanticle> >Their ideas were well received by TSR, whose marketing department felt they had enough dungeons, but not enough dragons.
[11:17:25] <quanticle> This amuses me *so much*.

[15:28:05] <Gurkenglas> Toy model: You pay % tax when you make money, you pay no tax when you lose money. That curve has a kink at 0, why not get % tax money when you lose money? Because the same corporations that currently move their profits to tax havens would move infinity money to tax havens. So then: Why not have tariffs on money movement, corresponding to the % tax difference?
[15:29:39] <Gurkenglas> (i'm guessing that the kink at 0 originates a lot of the complexity of tax law?)
[15:30:19] <kuudes> over here capital losses are deductible from capital gains before taxes
[15:31:15] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, as in, when you buy an apple at the farm for 2$ and sell it in the city for 3$ you only pay taxes on the 1$? That part I expected to be already true
[15:32:03] <kuudes> if you buy stock A for 100$ and stock B for 100$ and then sell A for 50$ and B for 200$, you pay tax of (200-100 + 50-100)
[15:32:33] <Gurkenglas> so you want to hold your lossy stock until you can find a winny stock to offset with?
[15:33:04] <kuudes> the loss gets saved over years with some rules sometimes, but the government won't ship you actual money, only allow you to deduct that from future taxes
[15:33:37] <Gurkenglas> why not ship money? in order to make sure that if someone finds a loophole they cant make the government ship you infinite money?
[15:33:44] <kuudes> yes
[15:34:22] <kuudes> mostly tax benefits here are of such form that it allows shifting some taxation etc, not give you money
[15:34:48] <kuudes> basicly taxes go out, for getting money in you have different institutes
[15:35:11] <kuudes> government also gives free money to businesses in some cases, but those indeed are different things
[15:35:49] <kuudes> also in eu there are rules on how a government is allowed to give money to businesses
[15:39:09] <Gurkenglas> the "dont ship money to guard against loopholes" sounds similar to this idea i had of "buy information on the market by writing a smart contract with a finite budget that would trade according to your world model, then sell it loaded with budget to the highest bidder, then see which vector they use to extract money to find where your model is wrong"
[15:39:46] <Gurkenglas> (because compared to trading on the market yourself, the advantage is that the loss is bounded to the budget)
[15:41:06] <Gurkenglas> (and also if your model can obviously be dutch booked, you recoup most of your losses in the auction)
[15:43:48] <Gurkenglas> But suppose we write a stupidly simple tax system to remove loopholes: % of all profit goes to government, same % of all loss is reimbursed. (international money movement has tariffs.) <- how does it fail?
[15:48:15] <nshepperd2> Gurkenglas: hanson's log market scoring rule seems like the best way to buy information tbh
[15:48:50] <nshepperd2> wish augur let you use it
[15:53:12] <kuudes> .wp tobin tax
[15:53:16] <feepbot> kuudes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin_tax A Tobin tax was originally defined as a tax on all spot conversions of one currency into another. It was suggested by James Tobin, an economist who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.
[15:53:46] <kuudes> there are transaction taxes, they often have loopholes of avoiding taxable transactions
[15:54:14] <kuudes> ie what if you don't move money in a bank account but instead give each others debt certificates of company etc
[15:54:14] <Gurkenglas> this would require a protocol update to augur, yes? Could one use the augur prediction "Augur will switch to protocol version 'Hanson' upon resolution of this prediction." to use Augur's dispute resolution mechanism?
[15:55:19] <nshepperd2> idk maybe you could write a custom smart contract which would use augur's oracle
[15:56:10] <nshepperd2> the obvious loophole of reimbursing all loss is you just make a shell company to loss money by trading with yourself
[15:56:50] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, then doesn't the shell company have to pay those taxes?
[15:57:11] <nshepperd2> no, the shell company loses money, so it pays negative tax
[15:57:24] <kuudes> yeah
[15:57:38] <Gurkenglas> oh, then doesn't whoever the shell company paid the money to have to pay the tax?
[15:57:47] <kuudes> also, you can "quantum teleport" money out of country by trading some derivatives that are traded on both sides
[15:58:06] <kuudes> ie if on wallet A you are liable for tax but on wallet B you are not
[15:58:15] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, now we're getting somewhere - can you give a simple example?
[15:58:42] <kuudes> so then you can buy derivative red on A and black on B and then wait until the random movements cause A to lose and B to win the planned money
[15:58:59] <Gurkenglas> what if the random movements go the other way
[15:59:25] <kuudes> presumably you could then finance B with a loan which A would guarantee etc
[15:59:48] <Gurkenglas> that sounds like an international transaction we can tariff.
[15:59:59] <kuudes> no, it is a promise, not a transaction
[16:00:03] <kuudes> no money changes hands
[16:00:07] <Gurkenglas> a promise of what
[16:00:14] <kuudes> to pay for possible losses
[16:00:21] <Gurkenglas> which payment we would tariff, yes?
[16:00:29] <kuudes> yes, but it never happens
[16:00:33] <Gurkenglas> how so?
[16:00:35] <nshepperd2> the payment is counterfactual
[16:00:38] <kuudes> yes
[16:01:12] <kuudes> there never happens any transaction between A and B
[16:01:21] <kuudes> B just wins on betting the market the same amount as A loses
[16:01:59] <Gurkenglas> I want to transfer 1$ to you. i put 1$ on red, you put 1$ on black. I win, oh noes. I gurantee a loan so you can pay 2$. I win again. This is to continue to infinity or until you win?
[16:02:07] <kuudes> this is why some pension savings systems here ban investing in anything but certain listed stocks etc
[16:02:20] <kuudes> yes, until I win
[16:02:31] <kuudes> and we double the bet size at each step
[16:02:38] <kuudes> and stop on my win
[16:03:05] <kuudes> so at each point of time it will resolve to my win on average 2 steps from current
[16:03:15] <Gurkenglas> and this is presumably not just the same folly as going to the casino with that plan since at the casino you can go bankrupt, whereas here you have more and more money to gurantee loans with
[16:03:29] <Gurkenglas> Wait, you don't have infinite money to gurantee loans with
[16:03:39] <Gurkenglas> There's a 50% tariff on me sending money to you
[16:03:57] <Gurkenglas> So after I win once, I have to dig into my pocket for an extra 50ct to gurantee the 2$ loan
[16:04:15] <Gurkenglas> uh, 2$, not 50ct
[16:04:52] <Gurkenglas> So it appears the quantum teleport doesn't work, because of the tariffs applying in the counterfactual :)
[16:05:02] <nshepperd2> uh what
[16:06:35] <Gurkenglas> I want to transfer 1$ to you, but there's a 50% tariff on that. We gamble, I win. Now I want to transfer 2$ to you and you have no money. So you take a loan, and I gurantee it; but since you got the money from your bank, I have to have 4$ to be able to gurantee your 2$ loan, since if you aren't good for it 2$ of my 4$ evaporate into tariffs

[16:08:17] <nshepperd2> you guarantee the full amount of whatever is the maximum you plan to gamble in one loan
[16:10:10] <Gurkenglas> I don't think you've understood. Let's change the numbers. I want to transfer 10$ to you, but there's a 10% international transfer tariff so you'd only get 9$. You go to your bank to get a 10$ loan for gambling. It wants someone who'll gurantee the money back. I say I'll do it; the bank says I have to stake 11.11$ so that 10$ would arrive at the bank in the counterfactual
[16:11:04] <Gurkenglas> I do this, we gamble, I win. The game repeats with all money multiplied by 2, and eventually i don't have the extra 1.11$*2^n needed to keep guranteeing the loan
[16:11:47] <nshepperd2> so there's a 1/2^n chance you'll need to transfer 2^n dollars for the loan repayment
[16:12:10] <Gurkenglas> yep, just like in the casino when you try to double until you win a dollar, there's a 1/2^n chance you go bankrupt
[16:13:40] <nshepperd2> so an expected $1 per transaction
[16:14:06] <Gurkenglas> what? no, the entire thing has expected value 0, by induction
[16:14:36] <Gurkenglas> when you compare it to just paying the tariff immediately
[16:14:43] <nshepperd2> what
[16:15:26] <nshepperd2> but yes, it doesn't seem like it saves you money
[16:15:43] <Gurkenglas> if you win, we dont lose the 1$ tariff. If I win and then i give up and send you the money, we pay double the tariff
[16:16:09] <Gurkenglas> and if we keep doubling until all money i hold is staked as collateral, i have to transfer it all to the bank, paying tariff on it all, and we're both bankrupt
[16:16:38] <kuudes> you can just have the bet to be onesided
[16:16:53] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, give a simple example?
[16:17:04] <kuudes> ie black happens 999/1000 and pays out 1000/999 and red happens 1/1000 and pays out 1000/1
[16:17:25] <Gurkenglas> that still sounds like the same strategy with the same refutation.
[16:18:00] <kuudes> sure, but that makes the scenario of "send money anyway" to happen similarly less often
[16:18:16] <Gurkenglas> no it doesnt
[16:18:21] <kuudes> so you can then just optimize to the lowest allowed probability of "send money anyway"
[16:18:24] <Gurkenglas> expected tariffs are conserved by all such games
[16:19:11] <Gurkenglas> so if you want to save 1$ on tariffs and you're willing to stake one billion, then whichever way you do it, there's a one billion chance to lose it if the rest of the probability mass is on no payment

[16:20:33] <nshepperd2> this seems more useful for avoiding fixed costs that don't depend on the transaction size. like federal agents snooping around enforcing KYC laws

[16:21:11] <kuudes> that is why there is 0 etc
[16:21:27] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, you can go to whichever market you were supposing to exist with the plan even without tariffs in place
[16:22:29] <kuudes> yes, you lose the amount of unfairness of the trade, ie fees
[16:22:37] <Gurkenglas> (maybe S&P going up 5% per year just means the market expects a ~5% chance of total bankruptcy of everyone each year :))
[16:22:39] <kuudes> and the point is to find a market where fees are lower than the tariff
[16:22:58] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, my argument that you don't save any money goes through if the market has no fees at all
[16:23:18] <Gurkenglas> and if you can find such a market, your ability to almost always make 1$ doesn't depend on whether tariffs exist
[16:23:23] <kuudes> yes, on average you don't. on median you do
[16:23:35] <Gurkenglas> your attack proves too much, it works today
[16:25:17] <kuudes> I pay 1$ for rolling a d1000 which if 1 results me getting 1000$ and otherwise results me getting 0$. you pay 1$ for the *same* roll and get 1000/999$ if it is not 1 and 0 otherwise

[16:26:51] <kuudes> no, I don't think so
[16:27:27] <kuudes> this is similar as in the past there was a way to circumvent inheritance tax
[16:27:35] <kuudes> inheritance tax is 5%
[16:27:48] <kuudes> life insurance payout is tax free to 100000
[16:28:16] <kuudes> so instead of giving your heir 10000 in inheritance, you buy with that 10000 an insurance which pays 9999 to your heir on your death
[16:28:30] <kuudes> so instead of 9995 after taxes your heir gets 9999 and bank gets 1

[16:45:17] <Gurkenglas> was afk. kuudes, the inheritance tax loophole works because there is a physical path by which you can route money that has less transaction tax along the way. In my case, there is no such physical route, because the tariffs are taken wherever the money moves across the border
[16:50:16] <kuudes> ah, you are saying there can't exist a shared market for the derivative, because the trades can't be settled without the tax?
[16:51:00] <Gurkenglas> i am allowing that there is a way to *gamble* money across the border unsupervised 1:1
[16:51:26] <Gurkenglas> this conserves the expected tariffs paid, after all.
[16:52:17] <Gurkenglas> but when the money randomly moves in the wrong direction and you want to double down, then the *loan gurantee* has to take a route across the border
[16:53:58] <kuudes> the point is your bank knows what you are doing and knows you will be able to not to pay the loan
[16:54:23] <kuudes> it can just be the same bank's two different branches
[16:55:11] <Gurkenglas> not quite - the bank will service your martingale (doubling down until win) strategy quite a bit: after all, you are staking larger and larger amounts of money as gurantee at every step
[16:58:06] <Gurkenglas> I like a system where anyone can gamble against the world at even odds repeatedly, by the way. It means that you can convert 10^-10 of the world's money into a 10^-10 chance at world domination.
[16:58:24] <Gurkenglas> We might need such a cooperation mechanism in the coming years.
[17:00:37] <Gurkenglas> And also, it means that we can to a first approximation model everyone's chance to win the ai race as their net worth, which means that everyone has *some* bargaining power in post-singularity acausal politics

[17:03:54] <Gurkenglas> If money translates into chance to win the ai race translates into portion of the cosmos allocated to you, it sure seems like every who has one dollar gets 10^5 planets. If there's a 99% chance AGI comes out unaligned but also with utility logarithmic in ressources and interested in acausal trade, a dollar only becomes 10^3 planets.
[17:04:59] <Gurkenglas> and 1000 planets per person seems like enough to capture 90% of the utility we'd get from 100000 planets per person

[18:40:49] <PapuaHardyNet> that's a lot of overthinking. I just don't care about clones - digital or virtual - of myself or the people I care about. It is their unique, irreplaceable version that exists right now that mtters

[18:42:05] <PapuaHardyNet> assuming that the scan is perfect, yes
[18:42:24] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm, I see what you mean
[18:42:30] <Gurkenglas> Yeah, rescuing the utility function in ontological crises by asking why you have it is more of an axiom that seems to make sense rather than a logical theorem.
[18:44:00] <Gurkenglas> (Though I challenge you to find a better resolution mechanism for an ontological crisis, such as caring about energy-as-the-conserved-quantity and then figure out that there's a quantum trick to conjure it.)

[18:46:41] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, I'd like to hear why you think that a destructively scanned copy of you would be you. Spoiler alert because anchoring bias: It might be because the copy will act as you do and have your rights and access, and so game-theoretically, cooperating with it is like cooperating with yourself.
[18:51:10] <Gurkenglas> Of course, I prescribe that everyone be uncertain about these matters, and that one does not aggregate an uncertainty of utility functions by taking an expectation.
[18:51:30] <PlanckWalk> I effectively destructively scan myself many times per year.
[18:51:48] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: It's the same argument (in my head) as that of me being the same person as I was an year ago. If it was a nondestructive scan I would be less confident of considering that copy as "me"

[20:13:21] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, if it turned out that it has always been true that human memories are garbage collected after 5 years since last access, would you freak out and have an ontological crisis?
[20:13:43] <kuudes> I guess
[20:13:52] <Gurkenglas> Would you want to know?
[20:14:08] <kuudes> I mean, I can accept last thursdayism, but I would not presume my feelings would matter in such case
[20:14:17] <RiversHaveWings> if you knew you could prevent the garbage collection by deliberately reviewing memories
[20:15:24] <feep> Gurkenglas: no that's fine for me

[20:17:55] <Gurkenglas> I have some memories that are originally decades old, but I did in fact recall them over the years, so I have no evidence that the garbage collection theory isn't true.

[20:29:12] <Gurkenglas> Whether he is indifferent to the prospect of finding out would presumably better a great deal to whether he tries to find out. Of course it wouldn't matter to whether it's true. Would he try to find out?

[20:43:15] <Gurkenglas> I hear no answer so I continue because it seems generally useful to have knowledge.
[20:43:20] <Gurkenglas> Exhibit A: You can barely say eyewitness around these parts without hearing that they're unreliable because brains fill in memory gaps.
[20:45:44] <Gurkenglas> Exhibit B: Complex adaptations are universal. It'd be weird if some brains use memory formats that must discard old data while others can just keep writing.
[20:47:03] <Gurkenglas> (Whereas varying the extent to which brains chain "i don't remember" into "guess from context" seems parametrizable enough)
[20:49:10] <Gurkenglas> Counterpoint: Eidetic/Photographic memory. I don't know the details of it. Are you intuitively favoring one way it must work? That would give some data on whether you want to find out.
[20:52:40] <Gurkenglas> *googles* oh look, wikipedia says it doesnt exist. children sometimes have *short-term* photographic memory, which fits with a "only so many bytes in a brain" theory.

[22:54:26] <ggreer> jesus streamlight, can you make your product naming any more confusing? they offer different weapon-mounted lights. there's the TLR-7 and the TLR-7a. the "a" version is larger and fits pretty much any pistol with a standard M1913 rail. the non-a version is smaller and fits pretty much any pistol with a standard M1913 rail...
[22:54:42] <ggreer> but there are also different product SKUs with the same name "TLR-7" which fit non-standard rails like the glock 43/48 rail (and another SKU for the sig p365/xl rail)
[22:55:58] <ggreer> I would get pissed at glock & sig for having proprietary rails, but it does make sense on those pistols. standard rails are wider than the g43/48 and p365/xl models
[22:57:37] <ggreer> in case anyone's curious: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picatinny_rail
[22:57:37] <Robomot> Picatinny rail - Wikipedia (The Picatinny rail (/Ààp…™k…ôt…™ni/ or /Àåp…™k…ôÀàt…™ni/), or Pic rail for short, also known as a MIL-STD-1913 rail or STANAG 2324 rail (canceled), is a military standard rail interface system that provides a mounting platform for firearm accessories. It was originally used for mounting of scopes atop the receivers of larger caliber rifles. ‚Ä¶)
[22:57:49] <dbohdan> galambo: A dedicated audio player has its own battery (you won't be left without a phone if it runs out), hardware buttons, and (if it's any good) more precise volume controls than Android.  It never skips due to a background task.
[22:58:24] <ggreer> playing audio uses like... 0% of my phone's battery. if I put it in airplane mode and just played audio, it would last for days
[22:58:38] <galambo> dbohdan, thats fair enough. I carry my own camera for similar reasons (also because my phone is eink)
[22:58:46] <dbohdan> ggreer: The battery seems in an okay condition, actually.  (As advertised.)  I haven't endurance-tested, but it looks like it should last at least six hours of playback.  In any case, I could replace it if the player wasn't borked.
[23:00:14] <dbohdan> ggreer: I'm guessing it depends on the phone and the audio codec
[23:01:10] <ggreer> I just realized that weapon accessories are the one place we haven't gotten integrated rechargeable batteries. it's always disposable lithium air batteries
[23:01:23] <ggreer> I guess it looks pretty stupid if you have to plug your gun into a wall socket
[23:01:39] <kuudes> I wonder how well one could load it safely
[23:01:53] <kuudes> I mean, often guns have to be locked etc while they are not at a person
[23:02:23] <kuudes> I guess you could integrate the loading to a gun safe or something?
[23:02:25] <dbohdan> ggreer: It would make for some tense moments in movies.  "Oh no, I have plenty of ammo, but my gun's battery is 5%!"
[23:02:25] <ggreer> yeah, 99% of the time, guns are locked up somewhere
[23:02:50] <kuudes> ...could it load the battery from the recoil?
[23:03:09] <ggreer> kuudes: that's... that might actually work
[23:03:22] <ggreer> except for the fact that if your accessory is at 0% battery, you have to charge it by shooting the gun :)
[23:03:43] <kuudes> yeah, that would be awkward
[23:03:52] <kuudes> "no office, I was just loading my gun"
[23:03:55] <Betawolf> a slippery slope to charging your phone by shooting people
[23:03:56] <kuudes> *officer
[23:03:58] <ggreer> "hold on let me charge my holosight" *blam!* *blam!* *blam!*
[23:04:19] <dbohdan> lol
[23:04:57] <kuudes> would it be useful if you would switch cartridges similarly as in video games, ie shooting away from the screen / up
[23:05:39] <kuudes> hmm. given how explosive bad batteries are, could one replace gunpowder with them? O_o
[23:05:43] <ggreer> usually it's a non-problem. LED efficiency has gone way up and now sights have accelerometers so they turn off if they're just sitting around. combined with the high energy density of lithium air batteries, you don't have to change batteries more than once a year
