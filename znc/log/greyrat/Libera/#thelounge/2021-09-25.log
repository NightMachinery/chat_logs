[22:17:08] <linguist> Heyy, is there a way to "reload" the server instead of restarting? I'd like to add a certificate, but I wouldn't love to disconnect IRC LOL
[22:17:45] <shadoozo> for that I'd recommend using a reverse proxy
[22:17:51] <shadoozo> but no, there's no such option
[22:18:56] <linguist> shadoozo: ohhhh, I see, I can use one without restarting the process, right? 
[22:19:23] <linguist> Or better, it's in my local lan so I could just use SSH forwarding
[22:19:27] <shadoozo> depends :P
[22:20:55] <linguist> Just a question: when the process ends, and starts again, I'll have to add all connections again, right?
[22:20:57] <shadoozo> if you run it on port 80/443 then you'd prob want to change it back to 9000 so your proxy can take 80/443 - but if you just run it on default 9000 with no https enabled atm then it should be as easy as following: https://thelounge.chat/docs/guides/reverse-proxies
[22:21:24] <shadoozo> did you sign in before you created the connections?
[22:21:42] <linguist> Ohhh, I see, yeah I'm using standard port 
[22:22:01] <shadoozo> with sign in / private mode it'll save them to the config and it'll reconnect everything when the server starts again
[22:22:26] <linguist> Thanks! How about channels? 
[22:22:39] <shadoozo> it'll also join the channels that you had open
[22:23:02] <linguist> Okay, so I guess restarting is not as bad as I thought

[23:54:46] <linguist> I'm wondering if that's possible, for it's thelounge on your server that's actually connecting to IRC
