[03:11:22] <junebug> Ok
[03:11:29] <V-T60> okay
[03:13:03] <Kaiod> I was looking at the topics that have been of most interest to youth (including adults) in recent months. The main one, which has been the focus of youth, is climate change.

[03:17:30] <Kaiod> The point, I came to, is that if we want to reach society with our idea, we must exemplify and explain about what we are about, based on her problems (if possible, the most attention-grabbing ones of the moment).
[03:18:59] <junebug> I think if we want to reach "society" we need to appeal to emotions. People don't respond to data and facts. They respond to emotional triggers

[03:26:03] <Kaiod> I believe that today, these numbers should be lower mainly because there was a greater mobilization of the agenda in 2020-2021. However, it is not very different from our situation, in the same way that climate activists say that these are divine actions, they say that the FSF is ideologically extremist.

[18:17:04] <DiffieHellman> irelativism: YEs
[18:17:16] <labrador> irelativism, its a suggestion
[18:17:16] <DiffieHellman> But I sadly can't make you listen
[18:17:18] <irelativism> FOSS is a good balance
[18:17:30] <irelativism> free software is really ambigious
[18:17:31] <jacobk_> Somehow I thought FLOSS meant FuLly Open Source before I knew what free software was lol
[18:17:36] <GNUHacker> irelativism: i only share links kid
[18:17:41] <DiffieHellman> Why would you balance free software and spineless "open source"?
[18:17:41] <GNUHacker> keep calm
[18:17:55] *** jacobk_ is now known as jacobk
[18:17:59] <irelativism> why you think Im not calm
[18:18:01] <irelativism> ?
[18:18:20] <DiffieHellman> irelativism: Free software is ambigious between free as in gratis and free as in freedom, but once you let someone know it's about freedom, they won't make the same mistake
[18:18:27] <irelativism> the fact that article exists is in itself the problem
[18:18:57] <irelativism> DiffieHellman: by the time you explain that you have already lost people in their thoughs
[18:19:10] <slips> You know, what *does* the GNU propose as an alternative for the term FOSS/FLOSS?
[18:19:10] <DiffieHellman> irelativism: "open source" has multiple implied meanings and none of those match up with the wanted meaning.
[18:19:20] <slips> s/GNU/GNU project/
[18:19:20] <DiffieHellman> slips: libre software
[18:19:30] <irelativism> also the issue here is not so much that but people thinking is good to tell others what to say
[18:19:36] <slips> DiffieHellman: S'pose that makes sense.
[18:19:36] <DiffieHellman> Then to free software when someone knows about freedom
[18:19:42] <jacobk> Though, even if a user knows what "free software" means, if they see the term elsewhere, how do they know that the person saying it isn't talking about price?
[18:19:53] <irelativism> DiffieHellman: that is why I dont iuse open source and use FOSS
[18:19:55] <irelativism> is interelly diferent
[18:20:42] <DiffieHellman> jacobk: In real life, no-one else uses the free software term, they say freeware etc
[18:20:44] <irelativism> free software is just ambigous
[18:20:53] <irelativism> FOSS seams to be a good balance
[18:21:10] <DiffieHellman> irelativism: Free and open source sounds can be taken to mean gratis software that is source available.
[18:21:32] <irelativism> either that or this movement comes up with new term in conjuction with GPLv4 release
[18:21:40] <jacobk> DiffieHellman: Well, I was thinking about online, when a user downloads software from a website, but I guess people shouldn't trust software from arbitrary websites anyway lol
[18:21:42] <irelativism> and the idea of selfsustaining collectives
[18:21:51] <DiffieHellman> Proprietary companies can abuse "FOSS" to cover their gratis proprietary software, not once has dared to use the free software ferm
[18:22:00] <irelativism> DiffieHellman: disagree
[18:22:06] *** Joins: wolftune (~aaron@97-120-55-127.ptld.qwest.net)
[18:22:07] <DiffieHellman> *has one dared to use the free software term mind you
[18:22:21] <irelativism> FOSS is simple and intuitive enough to mean libresoftware
[18:22:27] <DiffieHellman> irelativism: They say "for free", or "freeware" or "freedom software"
[18:22:57] <DiffieHellman> "open source" has a single meaning based off the words - the source is open.
[18:23:21] <DiffieHellman> If you apply free to that, the meaning become free source that is open.
[18:23:29] <DiffieHellman> Now *that* is ambigious
[18:23:42] <DiffieHellman> *misleading
[18:23:47] <irelativism> sure but either floss or loss sound stupid
[18:23:49] <kompowiec> if some project use apache license, i shoulld say free software or open source?
[18:23:53] <kompowiec> should*
[18:24:03] <irelativism> so some praticality are necessary here DiffieHellman 
[18:24:15] <irelativism> has said before FOSS reaches a good balance
[18:24:19] <DiffieHellman> irelativism: But proclaiming free software and that's it's about freedom doesn't sound stupid and is very practical

[18:24:43] <irelativism> or at least the FOSS section
[18:24:49] <DiffieHellman> There's no "balance", there's only compromising of freedom when you should not at all.
[18:24:51] <jacobk> kompowiec: Apache is a free license, so, assuming the license covers the binaries and source code, and the source code is actually available, the software is free and open source.
[18:25:14] <jacobk> If the license covers source code but not binaries, then the software is open source, but not free.
[18:25:18] <jacobk> I think
[18:25:29] <jacobk> (though, it would be easy to recompile and have a free binary)
[18:25:29] <irelativism> DiffieHellman: that is quite an exagerated and extreme view on it
[18:25:37] <kompowiec> jacobk, thank you
[18:25:39] <labrador> irelativism, its not really
[18:25:48] <DiffieHellman> It's possible for a free software license to cover the source and the binaries to be proprietary.
[18:26:17] <DiffieHellman> The way to aviod such proprietary software is to simply compile the source though.
[18:26:26] <jacobk> Yes
[18:26:34] <irelativism> to the general public freesoftware is ambigious and both FLOSS and LOSS sound very stupid

[18:44:08] <irelativism> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization
[18:44:10] <irelativism> ^^
[18:44:42] <jacobk> kompowiec: VS code is an example of nonfree open source software I think.
[18:45:07] <jacobk> Here: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
[18:45:22] <kompowiec> I think that the problem comes from a certain mentality where everyone thinks that free software is freeware and they deserve(?) it, which is illustrated by the example of log4j
[18:45:23] <jacobk> It's not on the overlap page for some reason, but it's mentioned in that article
[18:45:28] <DiffieHellman> jacobk: The source of VS code is free software, the binary is proprietary software
[18:45:41] <irelativism> I perfer to call it selfsustaining collectives though given the bad quonotation theDAO has on the idea
[18:45:51] <kompowiec> it is similar in the case of piracy, films are pirated the most, and games the least, because they are considered a luxury good.
[18:45:54] <jacobk> DiffieHellman: Yes, what I'm saying is the binary is open source, even though it's not free
[18:45:59] <kompowiec> at least according to statitics
[18:46:44] <kompowiec> jacobk, yeah i know this article, and i think that better to link here could "when you mixing free with nonfree"
[18:46:58] <DiffieHellman> jacobk: The binary does not qualify for the open source definition as you're not allowed to reverse engineer it for one thing
[18:47:10] <slips> Oh, that reminds me. Any suggestions on how to minimize the grossness of services like Google Meet and MS Teams? I am forced to use both for school and work respectively. As of now I've been only using both on a browser in a burner system for now, but any better ideas would be appreciated.
[18:47:26] <DiffieHellman> You're just demonstrating why it's a mistake to say "open source", good job
[18:47:30] <kompowiec> slips, nothing except use virtual machine
[18:47:45] <DiffieHellman> slips: Just say no even once.
[18:48:08] <DiffieHellman> If you can get out of a meeting or whatever, say that you'll prefer to use the nonfree software less.
[18:48:22] <DiffieHellman> Say that you're happy to use Jitsi etc of course
[18:48:39] <irelativism> OSS != FOSS DiffieHellman btw
[18:48:45] <DiffieHellman> MS teams and google meet are really only used as people don't know of the replacements
[18:49:01] <DiffieHellman> strstr("OSS","FOSS") > 0
[18:49:03] <kompowiec> the easiest way is probably in government schools, because there you can force the use of libre software
[18:49:14] <kompowiec> at least for myself
[18:49:23] <DiffieHellman> Yes, bigbluebutton is actually superior to m$ teams for one thing
[18:50:27] <slips> DiffieHellman: As much as I'd like to say no to using MS Teams, not participating in even a single meeting (at least, as of right now as a somewhat new employee) would get me a no call no show and the next would probably get me fired.

[18:54:20] <jacobk> DiffieHellman: I was going to say the Open Source Defintion only applies to source code, but it does actually say "The program must include source code", which means "The program" obviously isn't necessarily source code itself. But, it seems odd to me that a program should not be considered "open *source*", simply because of restrictions on the binary, because otherwise the words ("free" and "open source") would mean the same thing.

[22:16:02] <duik> Isn't ARM better than x86 in terms of freedom? I believe more companies can produce ARM chips than x86 chips due to it being Intel's intellectual property. Although ARM isn't completely open, at least they aren't producing chips themselves. Intel wants to kill any potential competition while ARM would arguably profit from competition in the chip market because a monopoly would force them to sell their license for a cheaper price. Correct me if
[22:16:02] <duik> I'm wrong
[22:16:48] <irelativism> yes in theory

[23:00:47] <zleap> google analytics illigal in the EU
[23:01:37] <zleap> kompowiec, i remember back in 1995 when there was no cdrom driver or poor support had to install Linux from floppy even though it came on a cd,  lots of rawrite file.img a: from dos to make the disk sets

[23:03:33] <zleap> yeah
[23:04:08] <zleap> i got round the cdrom problem as dos had cdrom drive support so used xcopy to copy cd to the hard disk and intallled from there
[23:04:11] <kompowiec> So, according the article, there are two possible scenarios: either Google will move data to its servers in Europe, or the US will revise its services' access rules to European data.
