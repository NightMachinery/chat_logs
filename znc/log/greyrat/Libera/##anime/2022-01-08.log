Also, minimum wage, no benefits.

[01:37:10] <MootPoot> emmeka: they do say a man's worth is attached to his job
[01:37:42] <Sapphirus> That's a very shallow representation of self-worth.
[01:38:19] <MootPoot> Only as shallow as my wallet
[01:39:03] <Sapphirus> In other words, assigning a singular thing to self-worth is shallow.
[01:39:56] <MootPoot> I just changed my android keyboard 
[01:41:15] <DaPinkOne> MootPoot, depending on the job and the hellscape you're workin it in, you don't have time for anything else, so it's common to attach your whole identity to your work
[01:42:10] <Sapphirus> Then becomes a question of life-work balance.
[01:42:35] <Sapphirus> For some, this might be okay if it's more of a willful thing than a "I need to live," type of thing.
[01:42:56] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: are you enslaved 
[01:43:38] <emmeka> MootPoot meh.
[01:44:05] <emmeka> I think it's kind of broken how over the past few generations we've built up this notion that anyone who doesn't have a ~good job~ is a failure
[01:44:28] <emmeka> guy who works a fulltime dead end job at like fuckin McDonalds or Walmart or whatever to support his family = loser, somehow
[01:44:57] <JesseDesu> no i'm in management
[01:45:08] <Sapphirus> emmeka, even extend that to people who are unemployed.
[01:45:09] <JesseDesu> i'm the lowest level management
[01:45:27] <emmeka> Sapphirus well, that's at least sensible to me
[01:46:07] <Sapphirus> In this economy, I think having stable employment is quite privileged. 
[01:46:22] <emmeka> in this economy, anyone who wants stable employment can have it, instantly.
[01:46:51] <JesseDesu> my job required a lot of reading accuracy tests
[01:47:07] <JesseDesu> to get in
[01:47:22] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: enslaved by the managers above you
[01:47:37] <Sapphirus> emmeka, there's a reason there's a labour shortage, though, because inflation and the rise of CoL has made slave minwage jobs worthless.
[01:47:39] <JesseDesu> i'd imagine if you're dyslexic with numbers you'd have trouble casing and delivering mail
[01:47:53] <Sapphirus> I wouldn't necessarily blame anyone for not wanting to work those jobs.
[01:48:32] <MootPoot> emmeka: its been over a month, where is my stable job 
[01:49:22] <Sapphirus> Especially not if it doesn't bring them independence or allows them to live. Why bother? 
[01:50:28] <Sapphirus> All the people who've been 'laid off' or rather fired from their non-essential jobs wonder where money is to put food on the table.

[02:01:59] <ButterNoodle> oh... and install alpine on this pi
[02:07:04] <emmeka> MootPoot you're searching exclusively for high paying remote work. Go work in meatspace and you'll find yourself a paycheque.
[02:08:02] <emmeka> don't actually do this, but, what I mean is that right now there is legitimately a labour shortage and I've never seen anything like it. Any shmuck can walk down the street and find a job offering over $20/h.
[02:08:41] <Sapphirus> can you actually get those jobs though
[02:08:51] <emmeka> yes.
[02:09:09] <Sapphirus> $20/hour is still like minwage
[02:09:20] <emmeka> minwage is $15/h
[02:09:44] <Sapphirus> which is too low
[02:10:08] <Sapphirus> rate of inflation and CoL far outpace the provincially mandated minwage
[02:10:12] <emmeka> for sure. but, look, there is legitimately a labour shortage. employers are idiots, many of them are whining instead of actually contending with the market, but even the ones offering good wages can't find people.
[02:10:33] <Sapphirus> did people vanish or what's happening
[02:10:45] <Sapphirus> I'm a bit at a loss to explaining some of it
[02:10:58] <emmeka> I was in my hometown over the holidays, and couldn't believe my ears when I heard a radio ad for a hiring fair, $25/h + sign on bonus, to a place that I once lined up at with 1000 people to interview for during the recession
[02:11:07] <emmeka> times have changed, and the times are on the worker's side right now
[02:12:30] <emmeka> Sapphirus well, think of how many boomers lost work over the recession and then just went "fuck it, I'm retired now."
[02:12:42] <emmeka> err, s/recession/lockdown
[02:12:56] <Sapphirus> Yeah, that's true.

[02:15:20] <Sapphirus> Whilst ignoring the problem of healthcare funding.
[02:15:37] <Sapphirus> I still remember the talks of 'hallway medicine'. ..
[02:16:26] <emmeka> it's amazing how apparently the reason we keep doing restrictions is that they're forecasting ICU beds being overwhelmed, and yet somehow, we aren't building more ICUs
[02:16:34] <emmeka> for 2 years
[02:16:45] <Sapphirus> A nursing shortage atop of that, too.
[02:16:51] <ButterNoodle> interesting
[02:17:02] <emmeka> yes good old Dougie and his wage freeze for nurses from like 2018 or whatever
[02:17:06] <emmeka> that turned out great
[02:17:09] <ButterNoodle> while nurses get laid off.. or fired :)

[02:19:32] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: its a legal issue - if you dont have a specialization in emergency care
[02:19:33] <MootPoot> well
[02:19:36] <MootPoot> fuck you then

[08:11:28] <Sadale> true.
[08:11:34] <Sadale> Only if you were living in China :P
[08:11:41] <MootPoot> its more worth it to just save your time and do aliexpress

[08:12:59] <Sadale> Actually I shouldn't be surprised tho
[08:13:08] <MootPoot> so basically I would stick it to the back of the metal target
[08:13:16] <MootPoot> using a magnet
[08:13:25] <Sadale> wait
[08:13:26] <MootPoot> and it would detect the vibration of being hit and send a signal
[08:13:31] <MootPoot> and I'd hear a beep on my side
[08:13:50] <Sadale> Are you sure that RF would work in proximity of a metal target? And you're even using a magnet.
[08:14:08] <MootPoot> I asked butter, he said 433mhz could pull it off
[08:14:12] <MootPoot> the distance is like 500m
[08:14:14] <Sadale> really? :/
[08:14:32] <MootPoot> there is a giant backstop of dirt right behind it to reflect the signal off of
[08:14:47] <MootPoot> or I could extend the antenna and put it to the side a little
[08:14:49] <Sadale> And 500m is very long.

[08:15:30] <MootPoot> well, its only like 12 dollars so
[08:15:37] <amigojapan> !c 1500/60
[08:15:38] <MootPoot> if it dosent work I can try using them elsewhere

[08:16:32] <MootPoot> >The HC-12 is a capable transceiver with an impressive range (up to 1 km). It is satisfactory for most hobby and even some industrial applications. It is an important alternative to the very inexpensive, low-power, but short-range nRF24L01. Though a bit more expensive than the nRF24L01, its range and simplicity of use make the HC-12 an excellent choice for projects involving tracking. In the next article we will explore using the 
[08:16:32] <MootPoot> HC-12 in a GPS (Global Positioning System) application.
[08:16:38] <Sadale> Anyway here's what I'd recommend. Put HC-12 model outside the metal and far away from the magnet. Keep the vibration detector inside the metal thingie. Connect the vibration detector with HC-12 using a cable somehow

[08:17:00] <Sadale> yes. yes. Technically it can transmit up to 1km but I wouldn't just take that number.
[08:17:01] <MootPoot> yeah I could do that as a workaround - there is a wooden frame that holds the metal target
[08:17:08] <MootPoot> I could stick it on the back of that
[08:17:18] <Sadale> true
[08:17:21] <MootPoot> maybe it might get hit by a bullet but
[08:17:22] <MootPoot> :3
[08:17:26] <MootPoot> its just a wire antenna
[08:17:58] <Sadale> anyway have fun :3

[08:23:00] <Sadale> Same. It isn't quite reliable
[08:23:29] <MootPoot> not reliable, slow, inconsistent, no redundancy, its pariring mechanism is terrible

[14:12:46] <Bco1981> i thought about this, why they would do this. some think it's new meassure against bots.
[14:12:57] <Bco1981> i'm starting to think it's about money.
[14:13:22] <Bco1981> many many people use ad blockers. so youtube don't get money.
[14:13:57] <Bco1981> if a person use ad blockers they don't count as a viewer.

[14:15:51] <Bco1981> yes... 30%
[14:16:02] <amigojapan> That's enough
[14:16:13] <Bco1981> it's never enough.
[14:16:18] <Bco1981> they are greedy
[14:16:46] <amigojapan> Bco1981: they also got rid of down vote count, why, that was very useful
[14:17:43] <amigojapan> Bco1981: they want us to watch shitty videos
[14:19:44] <Bco1981> idk, i agree on it shouldn't be a simple click to just make a dislike. you should be force to select a subject, and a reason. if those two are not filled. you can't give a dislike.
[14:19:54] <Bco1981> forced*
[14:20:39] <Bco1981> with just a dislike counter, that won't help the creator do make changes to make things better in the future.

[14:23:47] <Bco1981> that would probably not be many, my guess is that as soon as the outro is on, people close it.
[14:24:50] <amigojapan> Bco1981: count "the end"as 70% of the video

[14:46:39] <`Zephyr> I'd argue I am usually more motivated to tell someone who I disliked their thing than why I liked it.
[14:47:41] <`Zephyr> If I had to explain why I liked a video, half the time I wont even really have a good reason. It just made me feel good. But with the things I dislike, while sometimes it is a vague 'I don't like this', more often than not I have a specific axe to grind which I'd be happy to state.

[18:11:38] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: maybe there's a herb for that
[18:11:39] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: once I had something similar. And I just had a bit of a q-tip stuck in my ear
[18:12:36] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: that's why they recommend you don't use them for ears (but then why do they exist?)
[18:13:22] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: don't use q-tips to clean out ears cause they could perforate ear-drum or push wax further in etc.
[18:13:56] <DunceCotus> or in your case, break off and cause inner-ear mayhem
[18:14:26] <amigojapan> Yup
[18:14:36] <DunceCotus> q-tips seem specifically designed for ears, but they're too dangerous for use in ears

[18:16:51] <amigojapan> Yup
[18:17:30] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: perhaps q-tips are an anti-Mandela Effect

[18:50:11] <MootPoot> boring
[18:50:20] <MootPoot> not interesting
[18:50:25] <MootPoot> they want me to come in person
[18:50:29] <MootPoot> which is ...
[18:50:45] <zoidberg> Go then, what's the issue?
[18:51:02] <MootPoot> I dont want a IRL job
[18:51:15] <zoidberg> You want a remote job?
[18:51:22] <zoidberg> Work at home?
[18:51:41] <MootPoot> yeah - why would I want to spend time and money doing work stuff ( going to and from work ) 
[18:52:04] <MootPoot> when I could just do it from home
[18:52:13] <MootPoot> they want some kind of hybrid system
[18:52:51] <JesseDesu> they just want to make sure you're not a deep fake AI
[18:54:02] <DunceCotus> from work from home to wait why am I doing this work again?
[18:54:10] <DunceCotus> to all-out revolution
[18:54:55] <MootPoot> they gave me some bullshit about "we noticed people have higher productivity at the office and we have a awesome salad bar and pool table and coffee machine"
[18:55:02] <JesseDesu> i wonder if the US Air Force needs people to fill in spreadsheets
[18:55:11] <JesseDesu> i could totally do that
[18:55:12] <zoidberg> Yeah but you would get better pay, wouldn't you?
[18:55:47] <MootPoot> from my current job? Yes. But I'm sure there are other remote jobs out there which pay the same and dont require going in person
[18:55:59] <MootPoot> its not like this is a high level special position
[18:56:18] <Sadale> MootPoot, Some people do have higher productivity at a physical office tho. Just like I do. xD  Anyway communiting does take time and money :<
[18:56:23] <Sadale> commuting*
[18:56:28] <JesseDesu> what is holding you back from meeting them even once
[18:56:36] <JesseDesu> do you need a plane ticket to get there
[18:56:53] <Sadale> I don't think that he's being asked to show up in the office just once
[18:57:04] <MootPoot> Sadale: but you have to be there - you have to do embedded dev
[18:57:13] <MootPoot> theres no reason for me to go to there
[18:57:46] <JesseDesu> is it within motorcycling distance
[18:58:05] <Sadale> MootPoot, Actually for my previous job I was working mostly remotely since COVID. For that company, I just made the setup in the office and VPN into the company's network to do remote work.
[18:58:22] <Sadale> MootPoot, Unfortunately I could barely work at home. :P Not my problem tho. I got paid regardless.
[18:58:58] <Sadale> I dunno. Maybe my home's too small. And I feel like using it for relaxing rather than for working
[18:59:05] <DunceCotus> work from home is both convenient and insufferable
[18:59:24] <DunceCotus> work brushing up against home causes us to question both
[18:59:34] <DunceCotus> this isn't something capitalists want in their workers
[18:59:42] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: its like a 30min drive
[19:00:02] <JesseDesu> my commute is 30 minutes
[19:00:05] <MootPoot> but if I did get offered it, I would be going in person like 3 times a week
[19:00:15] <JesseDesu> 22 minutes if theres no traffic
[19:00:17] <DunceCotus> they want to control our time
[19:00:27] <DunceCotus> not only work time, but leisure time, commute time etc.
[19:01:08] <Sadale> DunceCotus, sad :(
[19:01:51] <DunceCotus> Sadale: we have to insist on work from home as an option
[19:02:08] <DunceCotus> if we can do that maybe we can get a scrap of more worker's power
[19:02:21] <Sadale> DunceCotus, I see. You're a fellow communist :3

[19:02:46] <DunceCotus> well I am but more on the anarcho side
[19:02:55] <MootPoot> back to remote*
[19:02:59] <MootPoot> if the govt says so
[19:03:19] <Sadale> Seriously tho I don't care. I don't like capitalism but I don't care about other workers as long as I'm good. :P
[19:03:27] <MootPoot> :\
[19:03:33] * MootPoot hits sadale
[19:03:38] <Sadale> For now I'm just trying to save up enough money for ditching this system.
[19:03:41] <DunceCotus> a post-covid capitalism has to accommodate for possibility of lab leaks of dangerous viral agents
[19:03:42] <MootPoot> that's pretty captialist of you
[19:03:49] <Sadale> ETA: 2040
[19:03:50] <DunceCotus> to do that maybe it will need work from home
[19:03:50] <MootPoot> not caring about other workers
[19:03:56] <Sadale> MootPoot, ouch!
[19:04:23] <DunceCotus> ditching system isn't possible
[19:04:29] <MootPoot> ^
[19:04:35] <DunceCotus> not without lines of flight
[19:04:40] <MootPoot> he's a hyper capitalist :3
[19:04:48] <MootPoot> trying to collect money
[19:04:50] <Sadale> MootPoot, haha. But I'm different! Unlike the true capitalist who just whore for money for lulz, I want to make just enough so that I could stop working
[19:05:07] <MootPoot> still participating
[19:05:14] <Sadale> millionaires wanna becomes billionaires, billionaires wanna become trillionaires and so on
[19:05:31] <DunceCotus> capitalism has adjusted to people living care-free for the mid 20th century to late
[19:05:31] <Sadale> true. But I'm participating as a worker, not as a capitalist
[19:05:36] <MootPoot> ....
[19:05:39] <JesseDesu> bajillionaires
[19:05:42] <Bco1981> Sadale: you can never ditch the system if you can't grow your own food, and make your own toilet papar. but, you can escape the job slavery, by saving up a shit ton of money.
[19:06:01] <MootPoot> you know you are a captialist right - if you participate in the system of using capital
[19:06:02] <Sadale> Bco1981, true. By "ditching the system", I really mean escaping the job slavery
[19:06:03] <DunceCotus> capitalism now has control over us by ruthlessly subjecting us to its chains as only possible horizon of meaning
[19:06:18] <Bco1981> Sadale: yeah that's what i thought you ment ;)
[19:06:26] <Sadale> MootPoot, But I spend far less money than you do. Your behavior is promoting capitalism. Me? Not so much as I spend only what I need.
[19:07:03] <DunceCotus> I don't want to simply escape, (what's outside?)

[19:07:41] * MootPoot points at sadale's clock
[19:07:56] <Sadale> I'm actually worried that there could be a worker revoltion within my life time. I mean I'm ok as long as it wouldn't hit my saving plan. But I could hardly imagine that'd be the case if that happens.
[19:08:14] <Sadale> MootPoot, The objective of the clock isn't money.
[19:08:28] <DunceCotus> actually it is
[19:08:35] <Sadale> MootPoot, and the clock barely cost me anything. I think the total cost of the project so far is like <$100.
[19:08:53] <MootPoot> but you bought parts with money - parts that were produced because of captialism
[19:09:08] <Sadale> MootPoot, At the end of the project I'd expect to spend <$300. But I could easily break even if someone's buying the clock.
[19:09:11] <DunceCotus> the clock is intrinsically tied up with mercantilism, financial activities etc.
[19:09:39] <Sadale> MootPoot, And I give away my products for free for people who can't afford that! :3
[19:09:46] <DunceCotus> the clock ties us to our shifts
[19:09:59] <MootPoot> but anyway - whatever your reasons, if you use and gather or spend money in any way, it dosen't matter - you are a capitalist 
[19:10:00] <Sadale> DunceCotus, Just so you know he's talking about my clock project.
[19:10:06] <MootPoot> cock project
[19:10:09] <Sadale> DunceCotus, I'm currently working on an internet-synchronized clock.
[19:10:25] <DunceCotus> Sadale: well that's interesting but i'm talking about 'the clock' as such
[19:10:25] <Sadale> MootPoot, You still spend far more than I do. You're like a supercapitalist. I'm just a mini-capitalist :P

[19:11:48] <MootPoot> Sadale: spending or saving dosen't make any difference
[19:11:52] <MootPoot> its just semantics
[19:12:12] <zoidberg> I hate the system sadale
[19:12:17] <DunceCotus> what does money do? Money makes the clock go
[19:12:24] <Sadale> MootPoot, ok. How about this? Even if I'm a capitalist I wouldn't want to be labeled as "capitalist" xD
[19:12:28] <DunceCotus> but the clock makes the money
[19:12:45] <zoidberg> Money does almost everything.
[19:12:51] <Sadale> Actually I'd name the time after I retire a "post-capitalistic era of Sadale"
[19:13:00] <DunceCotus> without clock time there is no money
[19:13:03] <MootPoot> Sadale: so basically you dont want to be capitalist- but you participate in the system because  you have to 
[19:13:04] <Sadale> Currently I'm in "capitalism resistant era" xD
[19:13:09] <MootPoot> so a unwilling capitalist

[19:13:52] <DunceCotus> we have to participate because we're tied down
[19:14:03] <DunceCotus> by commitments, relationships, which are all tied to capitalism
[19:14:18] <DunceCotus> if we take down capitalism it means disappointing X or bamboozling Y
[19:14:52] <Sadale> Anyway, do what you want. Just don't take away my hard-earned savings. I'm a fellow anti-capitalist even if I'd be able to amass a bit of money. xD
[19:15:26] <DunceCotus> Sadale: yes but everyone will think please don't take my savings
[19:15:27] <Sadale> I'd, conceptually speaking, support anti-capitalistic movement. In practice tho I'm just living my own life and I probably won't be joining any activism. xD
[19:15:34] <zoidberg> I hope to die before I get too old or when my savings fade away.
[19:15:35] <DunceCotus> ultimately everyone's savings is illegitimate because money sucks
[19:15:49] <DunceCotus> better ways of allocating new goods/services/homes required
[19:16:05] <`Zephyr> Nobody actually wants savings. What they really want is food and housing when they retire.
[19:16:07] <Sadale> DunceCotus, actually those billionaires would be a better target than me. In the end game I think I'd be at most become a millionaire./
[19:16:15] <`Zephyr> Right now we do that by gathering bits of spendy numbers.
[19:16:24] <Sadale> `Zephyr++
[19:16:42] <`Zephyr> The money is not the point. It's basically calling dibs on resources, present and future. 
[19:16:50] <DunceCotus> you cannot get communism or anything like it just by re-distribution or taxing billionaires
[19:16:51] <Sadale> I agree on this one.

[19:17:47] <Jigsy> ...but nooooo~
[19:18:19] <`Zephyr> I'd argue our economy IS a resource based economy. We just use money to quantify bids in the market. 
[19:18:32] <`Zephyr> We don't think of buying a sneakers bar at the store as an auction, but in effect that is what it is.
[19:19:07] <DunceCotus> how is that resource based?
[19:19:17] <`Zephyr> Because resources are the only things we actually use? 
[19:19:20] <Sadale> DunceCotus, if you wouldn't mind me to ask tho, how'd you describe yourself when it comes to your income? Are you working on those low-paying menial work? :(
[19:19:25] <DunceCotus> I thought resource based was centralised control over distribution

[19:24:44] <DunceCotus> Sadale: everything is already fucked up
[19:24:45] <Sadale> zoidberg, I thought that you lived on your own
[19:25:27] <zoidberg> Sadale: nah, I live with parents but it's almost like independent. I live upstairs.
[19:25:29] <DunceCotus> but sure if you're lucky or 'deserving' enough to have a decent job/income/money etc. then the system seems fine or just needs a few tweaks
[19:25:43] <DunceCotus> and anyone violently angry about the system appears as wreckers
[19:25:54] <DunceCotus> I think people need to step out of comfort zone a bit
[19:25:56] <`Zephyr> Because they are. For them.
[19:26:05] <Sadale> DunceCotus, no. When I said fucked up, I mean like setting shit on fire, blocking the traffic, etc. etc. I've personally experienced a political riot here in Hong Kong (China). I have a big problem with that. As I'm not politic, I pretty much don't care about political ideology. However, those kids set shit on fire, block the traffic, etc. etc. etc. It was causing problems to my daily life. :/
[19:26:10] <`Zephyr> It's not irrational for the winners of the current system to be concerned about anyone wanting to change it.
[19:26:12] <DunceCotus> `Zephyr: well for their identity sure
[19:26:23] <zoidberg> Not really DunceCotus. We're never satisfied. We always want something else.
[19:26:45] <Sadale> DunceCotus, Very glad that the governement had got the riots under control now. No more riots. Life's getting back to normal.
[19:26:56] <DunceCotus> Sadale: I agree that rioting and protesting can be counter-productive
[19:26:59] <KatrinValerie> zoidberg: I just want the machine overlords to take over already
[19:27:11] <DunceCotus> and just cause workers to hate the movement instead of joining or building it
[19:27:18] <Sadale> zoidberg, I agree. People could just start a riot over literally anything. Even for a pack of sauce.
[19:27:20] <`Zephyr> The machine overlords in the present form will be under the ownership and in furtherance of the interests of the rich.
[19:27:33] <DunceCotus> zoidberg: we're always satisfied
[19:28:10] <DunceCotus> satisfied with being frequently unsatisfied
[19:28:58] <DunceCotus> `Zephyr: the machinic capitalist 
[19:29:10] <DunceCotus> proles need to build their own war machine
[19:29:14] <DunceCotus> and we can
[19:29:23] <Sadale> I'm wondering if it'd be possible to gather people online who aren't happy with modern civilization to relocate to an unpopulated island. Then we could start a new primitive life there.
[19:29:50] <`Zephyr> That unpopulated island would have no meaningful quantities of resources to speak of. So all you're doing is a suicide pact with extra steps.
[19:30:03] <Sadale> It doesn't have to be an island. It could be any unoccupied places.
[19:30:08] <DunceCotus> Jim Jones says drink koolaid and transcend
[19:30:22] <Sadale> Not really. I mean you could build farm, hunt stuffs, catch fish and so on
[19:30:28] <`Zephyr> All the places in the world that had good farmable land or other resources have already been claimed.
[19:30:37] <`Zephyr> arable. I don't know why I went with farmable. 
[19:30:39] <Sadale> Are you sure about that?
[19:30:48] <Sadale> Just because it's claimed by a country doesn't mean that it's occupied
[19:30:48] <`Zephyr> Pretty sure, yes.
[19:30:56] <DunceCotus> right, capitalism has striated the space
[19:30:58] <Sadale> If it's unoccupied then we could just squat them :P
[19:31:19] <DunceCotus> squatting is one mode of deterritorialisation
[19:31:20] <Sadale> If it's in remote rural area, chances are that no one would catch you.
[19:31:25] <DunceCotus> but I fear its not quite enough
[19:32:04] <DunceCotus> Sadale: generally squatting is included in the system
[19:32:15] <DunceCotus> there's still ways of taxing it, or criminalising it if need be
[19:32:32] <Sadale> yes it may not be legal. The point is that if it's remote enough, no one'd find out
[19:32:57] <Jigsy> It's only illegal if you're caught.
[19:33:02] <DunceCotus> Sadale: you'd get bombed pretty quick if it develops enough
[19:33:02] <Sadale> Actually there's one place that you could just claim AFAIK. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bir_Tawil
[19:33:02] <ImoutoBot> [title] Bir Tawil - Wikipedia
[19:33:23] <Sadale> Technically speaking, this place isn't claimed by any countries.
[19:34:01] <`Zephyr> Bir Tawil is a desert. 
[19:34:02] <DunceCotus> Sadale: if its isolated it would be very easy to release biological agents etc.
[19:34:27] <Sadale> What even's the point of doing that if you're just a tribe-like civilization?
[19:34:32] <DunceCotus> no we need squat cities in our cities
[19:34:39] <DunceCotus> we need a new occupy movement maybe
[19:34:48] <DunceCotus> with some actual organisation
[19:35:08] <DunceCotus> there is no 'return to monke'
[19:35:12] <Sadale> just so you wait until someone grab the power for their own interest. power corrupts.

[19:38:11] <Bco1981> you should eat slow, and enjoy it.
[19:38:19] <Sadale> MootPoot, I don't eat breakfast
[19:38:29] <Sadale> MootPoot, only two meals per day to me. Lunch and Dinner.
[19:38:32] <MootPoot> tbh if you wanted to save money, the way to go is a remote job that is US or HK based
[19:38:34] <Sadale> Saves 33% of cost
[19:38:46] <MootPoot> Sadale: what? lol
[19:38:50] <Sadale> MootPoot, I bet that a remote US job would pay far less than a physical US job
[19:38:59] <MootPoot> you'll just end up eating the same amount 
[19:39:14] <Sadale> MootPoot, seriously tho the reason for me not having breakfast isn't money. It's just that I'm not used to having it xD

[20:09:42] <Sadale> GPS probably ain't that accurate
[20:09:58] <MootPoot> as long as its accurate to 5m it should be okay imo

[23:49:56] <emmeka> arg. I just gave myself a black eye.
[23:50:20] <emmeka> was loading up the trailer, slipped on the ice, smashed my face into the steel of the trailer
[23:50:22] <emmeka> is not the best
[23:50:39] <Cryowolf> I wonder if they would record my surgery for me using my camera or smartphone if I asked them. I mean like just place somewhere out of the way or attach it to the lights. Then I can watch my own surgery when I wake up
[23:51:26] <JesseDesu> why
[23:51:37] <JesseDesu> thats total cringe

[23:52:08] <JesseDesu> *surgeon
[23:52:28] <Cryowolf> No, it's a recent fascination. Since my cancer diagnosis and such

[23:53:44] <davic> ez moni
[23:54:55] <Cryowolf> like shit. Got a hernia that's called "ärrbrock" in Swedish. The incision that went from below my belly button to my ribcage separating left and right abdomen never healed properly and has now opened up completely (under the skin) pressing the internal organs against the skin and making it hard for me to stabilize my core, lift heavier things, walk longer distances etc
[23:55:00] <Cryowolf> and it hurts
[23:55:37] <Cryowolf> meeting a surgeon on the 13th that's gonna give it a look and determine if they can do it soon at this hospital or if I need to go elsewhere
[23:56:11] <Cryowolf> cause right now I'm lying down or sitting very reclined 99% of the day
[23:56:55] <Cryowolf> can't really live like this, so gonna get surgery (obviously)
[23:57:18] <Cryowolf> I can also put half my fingers underneath my ribcage around the center now
[23:58:10] <Cryowolf> it's one thing after another, so I'm feeling quite depressed. But I don't like to talk like I need a pity party
[23:58:18] <Cryowolf> so how are you davic?
