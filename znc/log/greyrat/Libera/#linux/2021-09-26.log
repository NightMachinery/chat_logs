[02:06:36] <fakuve> Hi , since #networking is a channel that judges by what you are doing by considering almost everything to be hacking , I'm gonna throw it in here . I have made an ssh reverse Tunnel from my VPS in order to be able to ssh back to my host from other hosts os mine . Problem is that the connection got dropped recently, and I can see the ports are opened and the process is still there , seems as It cannot kill

[02:10:16] <akk> keir: Interesting. I wonder how it does that since it's written in python and I didn't think there were any python webkit bindings any more.
[02:10:36] <ExplosiveUB> they have many forks in github, qtgen in gits.
[02:10:37] <mattf> oh i thought qutebrowser used chrome!
[02:10:48] <akk> Hmm, I guess there are, I see a python3-pyqt5.qtwebkit package
[02:10:48] <ExplosiveUB> that's the only problem

[02:10:57] <mattf> :(
[02:10:59] <ExplosiveUB> yes
[02:11:04] <mattf> that explains it
[02:11:17] <Jacki> ok
[02:11:18] <keir> mattf: i believe qtwebengine is ungoogled though
[02:11:20] <ExplosiveUB> so webkit might provide a python wrapper for tput and then you have your own python wrapper to tput and then you have qtwebengine which is a library for tput and then you add your own code to your own program which is a wrapper for qtwebengine.
[02:11:44] <ExplosiveUB> hmmm

[02:16:31] <mattf> what i dont get is they call those rendering engines, but they do much more than that dont they

[02:59:28] <ExplosiveUB> i3status is very unix based
[03:00:09] <mekeor[m]> jcbjoe2021: i think rsync can be faster than cp when copying multiple files because it can copy intelligently, e.g. it can only copy missing files etc

[03:01:03] <rascul> if you're copying a bunch of files that do not exist already at the destination, on the same system, rsync is likely to be slightly slower
[03:01:20] <rascul> depending on how you use cp
[03:01:40] <rascul> in many other cases, rsync is likely to be faster

[03:02:38] <rascul> rsync is using the same lower level functions to copy a file to another drive
[03:03:24] <rascul> rsync also will check and if the file already exists it won't copy it (depending on options)

[04:27:36] <ExplosiveUB> agh authentication is not a git url. what is it, you need the key ?
[04:27:40] <akk> When I push to github it uses my id_rsa, but I can't figure out why -- don't see anywhere where that's configured.
[04:27:57] <akk> Does ssh have "id_rsa" hardcoded and automatically looks for it if no other key is specified?
[04:28:04] <rascul> akk if you use the ssh uri then it'll use ssh to do it which uses id_rsa as one of the defaults
[04:28:16] <fakuve> https://github.com/myuser/myrepo
[04:28:19] <fakuve> https

[04:30:53] <ExplosiveUB> good news :) I can also configure for the client side if you are on Windows (I have it on Linux)
[04:30:54] <akk> goodblood: deprecate https in favor of what? Most people initially cloning a repo don't have ssh access.
[04:31:07] <ExplosiveUB> if they do have ssh access, they probably use ssh anyway
[04:31:16] <rascul> they might
[04:31:28] <akk> I don't, because I have passwords on my ssh keys, and I don't want to have to use a password to pull.
[04:31:30] <rascul> plenty of use cases for read only that don't require ssh access
[04:31:34] <fakuve> so `git push git@github.com:username/repo` is that using ssh by default? (is that a ssh sort of URL ?)
[04:31:36] <akk> So I always pull with https.
[04:31:41] <rascul> fakuve yes that's using ssh
[04:31:49] <ExplosiveUB> what if you don't ssh, i guess
[04:31:49] <rascul> it's a uri not a url
[04:31:57] <fakuve> rascul: alright , thats cool didnt know that thanks
[04:32:03] <ExplosiveUB> if you don't need ssh access, you should always just use https

[06:43:50] <No1x3r0> Phogg, I know like on openbox bspwm and xmonad and such there are scripting to disable some things but I think they all use the same tool chain.
[06:43:52] <phogg> looks like GTK has a "global menu bar" support in some manner, e.g. https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2021/06/enable-global-menu-ubuntu-20-04-21-04/ talks about it. With that and a WM-provided global location, the WM could then hide the gobal bar
[06:43:55] <Intelo> No1x3r0 I wonder why not terminal
[06:44:02] <ExplosiveUB> I'll try it right now
[06:44:30] <phogg> you would also have to do something for Qt apps. For those within KDE I believe there is also another global menu bar option, which would also need to be supported

[08:08:28] <vfbsilva> folks what isd the best way to clone one nvme disk to other assuming I have a single ssd slot on my mobo?

[08:11:05] <Minus_One> vfbsilva, you can get an M.2 to sata adapter. Or USB M.2 housing. Or as a more time consuming but potentially free option, copy an image of the first drive to another sata drive you already have, then use that image on the other nvme drive
[08:11:27] <Minus_One> but do you really need to clone? Or can you just partition the second drive and copy files? That would be much faster
[08:11:38] *** Quits: jean (~jean@user/jean) (Quit: Quitter)
[08:11:46] <Minus_One> you might have to adjust UUIDs in fstab and the like if booting to it
[08:12:07] <vfbsilva> Minus_One: the USB M.2 housing is damm expensive in Brazil. Well the thing is the nvm I want to copy from is from my dell notebook. and it has the rescue image on it
[08:12:43] <vfbsilva> would I have to adjust UUIDs in a new clean disk?
[08:13:00] *** Quits: Leonarbro (~Leonet@user/leonarbro) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:13:19] <Minus_One> If you copy the partition scheme/flags and make the UUIDs the same, then copy files I think it would work. Not that I have tried.
[08:13:39] *** Joins: jean (~jean@user/jean)
[08:13:47] <Minus_One> unless it is MBR, you would need to copy the MBR I imagine
[08:14:34] <Minus_One> do you only have the single dell notebook available to you? No hard drive and a machine with available sata slots?
[08:14:41] <alkisg>  Yeah in MBR you'd also need grub-install
[08:14:58] <vfbsilva> it is its gpt with. I do have another machine I just not on the mood.
[08:15:27] <vfbsilva> so i would need to put the nvme on my desktop copy to an external hdd then rescue with clonezilla
[08:15:51] <Minus_One> that is a way to do it, sure
[08:16:05] <ExplosiveUB> if you can't make a fresh install from the machine with the recovery image
[08:16:37] <Minus_One> it is gonna take a while to make/write that image, mind you. Unless you are copying from a rather small NVME to a pretty fast drive
[08:16:51] *** Quits: jean (~jean@user/jean) (Client Quit)
[08:17:09] <Minus_One> Take a while as in, start it before you go to sleep and hope it is done copying when you get home from work the next day
[08:17:10] <vfbsilva> Minus_One: thats why I keep post phoning the task. It is 256GB nvme I expect about one hour to copy to ssd
[08:17:18] <vfbsilva> so long?!
[08:17:21] <ExplosiveUB> but that seems like a rather long time
[08:17:24] <Minus_One> you are copying to ssd, that will help
[08:17:34] <Minus_One> I was imaging like a basic hard drive for the intermediate device
[08:17:37] <Minus_One> *imagining
[08:17:52] <Minus_One> but it seriously can take a long, long time lol
[08:18:05] <vfbsilva> Also can you suggest me a better tool than clonezilla, that thing gave me the creeps

[08:18:14] <Minus_One> dd works nicely
[08:18:16] *** Joins: jean (~jean@user/jean)
[08:18:17] <ExplosiveUB> that should be fine
[08:18:19] <Minus_One> or even cp
[08:18:29] <Minus_One> but clonezilla works fine from my understanding
[08:18:44] *** Joins: kish` (~aqua@user/aqua)
[08:19:37] <Minus_One> I am probably exaggerating the time it takes from past experience with hard drive and USB 2
[08:20:32] <donught> clonezilla is nice because it will remake the partitions and copy the data for you, instead of copying the partition raw, which means you only clone used data, and not the entire size of the device
[08:21:09] <Minus_One> Huh, I didn't know that. That is definitely a more efficient approach
[08:21:19] *** Quits: pkx (~pkx@user/pkx) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)

[08:22:10] *** Quits: peetaur (~peter@204.237.2.79) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)

[08:26:12] <donught> youd still have to shrink the partition first before you copy it
[08:26:23] <ExplosiveUB> that would be great
[08:27:29] <donught> if you are copying ssds, clonezilla will be incredibly faster if your drive isnt full
[08:27:29] <hemimaniac> so you could copy /dev/sda1 (let's say 15GiB to <somewhere/wonderful/magical> then put it back by using a live medium and making a partition for it, as long as you leave the rest as unformulated
[08:27:58] <donught> unless you cp / rsync the data to a newly created partition
[08:28:03] <hemimaniac> 8unformulated/un-formatted
[08:28:46] <donught> yes
[08:28:52] <hemimaniac> worst case scenario, what it take gparted to shrink a partition? 10-20secs
[08:29:08] <donught> but you could also copy /dev/sda as an image and restore that to the entire drive, and that carries the partition table with it
[08:29:24] <hemimaniac> right
[08:29:29] <Dagmar> "Worst case" on the shrinking of a filesystem with files in it is _many minutes_
[08:29:46] <ExplosiveUB> I'd like to put /fs on the ext2/3 filesystem to have all the partitions, and also have all filesystems in my /home /etc etc directory (like ext4)
[08:29:53] <donught> not exactly, i deal with clone 2 and 4TB ssds all the time that are only 30GB full...
[08:29:56] <Dagmar> gparted can wind up having to actually move everything that's in the space that will no longer be part of the partition

[08:30:10] <Dagmar> Oh, and may the gods have mercy on your data if something happens while it's doing that.
[08:30:24] <ExplosiveUB> how do you get all your ext4 partitions into /home /etc /tmp etc?
[08:30:42] <Dagmar> So for shrinking, it's generally safer/easier to just copy everything out, reformat to the new size, and then copy the data back
[08:30:54] <ExplosiveUB> you'll have to do that manually again?

[10:20:15] <Maxdamantus> Ah. So maybe that's why it's working this time. /proc/1 is android, and I've noticed that at least the `mount` command in android results in shared mounts.

[10:21:35] <Sauvin> You're aware you're discussing Android stuff in a Linux channel? The two are not the same.
[10:22:25] <Maxdamantus> The kernel is mostly Linux, so it mostly obeys regular Linux mount semantics.
[10:22:26] <donught> linux is a kernel, and he is asking about /proc which is exposed from it. i dont see any problem with that.

[18:31:03] <madprops> how can I make rofi detect flatpak apps?
[18:31:19] <tirnanog> xx: ultimately, the only thing that one can say generally is that a trailing slash qualifies a directory in no uncertain terms. for example, it's fairly easy to reason with the fact that cp -a a/ b/ raises an error in case either refers to a regular file. ultimately, though, you have to read the documentation of the program that you are using to fully understand its behaviour. or, at the very least,
[18:31:20] <tirnanog> experiment sufficiently.

[18:31:37] <madprops> MrElendig, that's what i did lol. But it's not ideal

[18:32:50] <NiLon> too bad it doesn't explode too

[18:33:37] <MrElendig> most flatpak apps do include a desktop file, if your distro adds the path to the data dirs is a different question
[18:33:46] <tirnanog> xx: cp(1) makes for an interesting test case. for example, `mkdir -p a/child; mkdir -p b; cp -Rv a/ b` is different where "a/" is changed to "a/.". in this case, the opengroup docs state that the destination path "shall be the concatenation of target, a single <slash> character if target did not end in a <slash>, and the pathname of the file relative to the directory containing source_file.
[18:34:09] <madprops> MrElendig, I'll add the path myself, if I find out what it is
