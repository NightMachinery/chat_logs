[04:29:46] <sney> right, the reverse-engineering exists but it's more like 50-50. even those one-off github repos for usb dongles are realtek-owned as often as not

[08:51:05] <jmd> (In the past, whenever I have used apt, wierd things happen and after seeking advice it is always "apt is experimental.  Use apt-get instead if you want it to work")
[08:51:34] <somiaj> really? apt and apt-get are really the same, the main difference is the interface
[08:51:44] <somiaj> apt looks nicer, and isn't locked into a static api
[08:52:04] * n4dir uses apt-get
[08:52:06] <somiaj> apt is now more meant for users to type the command, and apt-get is a stable api with stable output for scripts
[08:52:23] <somiaj> took me a bit, but I find apt nicer, though I have never noticed an issue with it, apt and apt-get will resolve the same
[08:53:57] <somiaj> note, notrhign wrong with sticking with apt-get, I just find apt nicer, it also now has search terms like aptitude (in bullseye)
[08:54:29] <sney> also, it has apt list
[08:54:37] <aaro> you also save 4 letters
[08:54:51] * n4dir wanted to shout, realized he is not on bullseye ... lol
[08:55:07] <somiaj> apt list ~o or apt list ~i in bullseye is nice
[08:55:26] <jmd> Anyway the apt-secure(8) manpage I was invited to read does not mention that --allow-releaseinfo-change so either the error message or the manpage is wrong.

[08:56:13] <somiaj> jmd: apt's manual pages are spread apart, that option is listed in apt-get, but apt-secure talks about it in the context of why apt-get is doing this
[08:57:14] <somiaj> jmd: under apt-secure INFORMATION CHANGES states what is going on, though it doesn't tell you how to accept the changes, for which you have to check the apt-get man page.

[09:00:11] <somiaj> I guess it is newish, buster was the first release that started for force it
[09:00:13] <n4dir> i don't recall i had to --allow-releasinfo-change in the past
[09:00:32] <somiaj> though here if you used apt, it prompts you and you can just hit y
[09:01:31] <n4dir> sounds better, thats for sure. But then you don't have to do it that often (bad too, as you will have forgotten it next time you have to )
[09:02:18] <somiaj> I almost think I saw a bug report similar to jmd's observation to make the error message a bit more user friendly (in telling them what to do)
[09:03:09] <n4dir> would make sense. When he asked i couldn't remember what i did and searched the web. All i found were general upgrade instructions. I probably asked here

[11:53:32] <mannequin> use ufw
[11:53:49] <somiaj> no need to if you want to manually write your own rules
[11:54:03] <mannequin> he can do that
[11:54:18] <mannequin> but personally i find ufw more convonient
[11:54:31] <somiaj> jmd: https://wiki.debian.org/nftables#nftables_in_Debian_the_easy_way
[11:55:23] <jmd> The rules have been written (many, many years ago) I'm not going to change them unless I have a network topology change.  The question is just where to put them so that they get run at startup?
[11:55:37] <somiaj> that link I shared gives you that info

[11:56:31] <mannequin> but then again, i use ufw
[11:56:43] <somiaj> https://wiki.debian.org/iptables follow that if you want to use iptables (Which is basically nftables anyways)
[11:57:07] <somiaj> it susgest once you get the rules like you want, 'iptables-save > /etc/iptables.up.rules'

[11:58:06] <somiaj> that wiki link gives you a way to hook it to your interface in the interfaces file
[11:58:13] <somiaj> though looks like nftables has a systemd service you can just enable
[11:58:18] <sussudio> a, tent.

[12:07:29] <Mids_IRC> Hello. I moved from a rolling-release Linux to Debian and would like to transfer my Firefox profile, but the one I have is older than I had before. A Firefox backport does not exist, and I don't really wish to have an unstable system (Manjaro gave me PTSD). What should I do in this case?
[12:07:57] <rk4> you can install firefox in $HOME too
[12:08:53] <somiaj> Mids_IRC: if you want to run the supported esr release of firefox, you'll just have to manually recreate the profile
[12:09:07] <somiaj> if the profile is for version 92, the new esr version 92 should be in debian in 3 months or so
[12:09:22] <somiaj> so you can wait for that, or you can install firefox from mozilla directly in $HOME
[12:10:12] <rk4> a lot of debian use stock debian packages for most things, then for a few select things manage them some other way - perhaps a third party package manager [eg: guix|nix], or just manually installing in /usr/local/ [optionally w/ stow] or $HOME

[17:47:21] <pazof> just with memory space
[17:47:38] <LOOL123> Hello. Even in linux I can not convert the vdi. I did qemu-img convert -c -f vdi myVM.vdi -O qcow2 myVM.qcow2;. it takes too much time. does it works with a vdi with snapshots?
[17:48:00] <jkc> swap isn't memory space. swap is swap space.
[17:48:46] <pazof> indeed
[17:48:54] <jkc> Then I don't get what you're talking about.
[17:49:06] <rk4> weird, so i'm trying to troubleshoot ssh key login not working on a clean buster install. i've commented out everyline of sshd_config but UsePAM no & PasswordAuthentication no; then as my user i did a rm -fr .ssh; ssh-keygen; ssh 127.0.0.1; and i get an immediate access denied. adding 'AuthenticationMethods publickey' to sshd_config doesn't change anything...any thoughts?
[17:49:28] <rk4> auth.log merely says "Connection closed by authenticating user"
[17:49:30] <amenonsen> (i want the larger swap partition just to make hibernate work, btw.)
[17:49:43] <jkc> rk4: I would return your sshd_config to its original state and we can begin troubleshooting there.
[17:49:56] <joepublic> swap partitions don't cause kernel panics.
[17:50:29] <pazof> it help in not causing panics, isn't it ?
[17:50:30] * rk4 wonders how to restore pam to the original state too
[17:50:33] <jkc> pazof: No.
[17:51:13] <jkc> pazof: swap space is a core part of the Linux memory management model. Please stop advertising it as bad, especially given your apparent lack of understanding.
[17:51:22] <LOOL123> wait this is now finish but the image is only 2 GB I will check the image
[17:51:33] <amenonsen> (well, to be fair, having a large-enough swap partition would help with not causing *me* to panic: "oh no, how will i live without hibernate?!?!")
[17:51:46] <espero> as for me it's better to use zram instead of normal swap to HDD/SDD

[17:53:59] <espero> jkc, there should be a reason newer Fedora versions switched to zram instead off swap partition/swapfile
[17:53:59] <PMT> LOOL123: since i think VDIs usually store snapshots as separate files, I imagine you only got whatever the initial state was.
[17:54:03] <jkc> espero: Second, swap speed isn't much of a concern either, because unless you've messed with swappiness, it should be paging out memory well before its actually needed.

[18:02:03] <jim> ssh-copy-id can do that, as long as there is another way (usually password auth) to get in
[18:03:41] <jim> amenonsen, possibly, the partition table has what you want, having been written... you can check in the partition tool of the installer

[19:39:12] <LOOL123> I think vbox does not handle too :/
[19:39:19] <LOOL123> what should I do?
[19:39:24] <PMT> i believe vbox can do it
[19:39:31] <PMT> i do not know offhand how to  convince the CLI to do it
[19:40:12] <PMT> perhaps you should check for a virtualbox IRC channel or mailing list and inquire there.
[19:40:26] <LOOL123> PMT should I try to export to OCI?
[19:40:30] <LOOL123> before?
[19:40:33] <LOOL123> ok
[19:40:49] <PMT> you can do that. i think i would expect that to result in copying all snapshots, but i have no idea in what format.
[19:41:10] <PMT> also, i could be wrong, i don't think i've ever tried exporting that way with snapshots.
[19:41:23] <PMT> but the GUI does support copying snapshotted disk images.
[19:41:56] <PMT> so I would presume the CLI can be convinced to do it.
[19:43:14] <LOOL123> I can not speak at #VirtualBox  Cannot send to nick/channel
