[00:00:11] <alyx> hi! I'm trying to split a string, e.g. user@host:port into (user, host, port); right now I'm thinking strings.Split on @, then strings.Split the 2nd part of the array by :, but is there a less gross way to do it?
[00:00:36] <bpalmer> Consider regular expressions.
[00:00:48] <alyx> ...oh yeah this is a situation where regex actually makes sense

[05:04:21] <fizzie> huoy99: Perhaps you're better off just starting with the corresponding unsigned bit pattern without getting any signed types involved (until the very end). https://go.dev/play/p/de_mj_SQmME will give 512, for example.

[05:04:58] <wnd> b0nn, I've been asked to review a PR with a constant defined as "4380*60**2"
[05:04:59] <ramblebamble> the binary representation is apparently different, s.th. I did not know myself, but would make sense, if you wanna detect these type of errors
[05:07:16] <fizzie> The intent of the Java code, as far as I can guess, is to start from the "unsigned" 0x80000000 and then shift that right using the >>> operator to treat the signed `int` as if it was unsigned (since Java doesn't have real unsigned types). For Go, just keep it a uint32.
[05:07:49] <fizzie> (By the way, the standard library's "math" package has min/max constants for all the integer types.)

[12:08:32] <iroha> foobaz , b0nn thanks for answers and playground (and resizing reference, that's pretty interesting). Generally I get append vs make will be situtional. Maybe I just have some impression of "more concise" implying the `make` example is suboptimal. Just wanted to figure out if I'm missing something obvious about append being better than make in this specific example.

[14:35:18] <bookworm> no clue, I'd attach delve and have a look that way
[14:37:18] <bookworm> do you have some go routine setup? Considering that you have server already declared somewhere?
[14:38:01] <bookworm> the question basically amounts to, are you sure that the server in log.Fatal(server.Listen...) is the same as the one you assign above? Are those lines really as is in your code?
[14:38:11] <bookworm> Or are you copy pasting those lines from some other place?

[14:38:35] <bookworm> Because if you simply declare a var server http.Server and never actually do the init, that would do exactly that nil pointer thingy

[14:39:58] <bookworm> ehm, *http.Server... http.Server itself can actually serve
[14:40:54] <bookworm> also, note that you don't need to manually handle the pointer in this case... just use a normal http.Server rather than a pointer to it
[14:41:07] <bookworm> go will happily convert it to a pointer receiver when you call the method

[14:44:38] <Thedarkb1-Work> What I cut out was just config file parsing stuff and whether or not to use TLS, which now that I'm re-writing this bit is commented out.

[14:46:20] <bookworm> (remove the declaration and use the := operator if you don't actually need the declaration)
[14:47:49] <Thedarkb1-Work> I'll need it in the future so I said I'd get it over and done with now.
[14:48:02] <bookworm> eh, why?
[14:48:14] <bookworm> Pass the server to whatever needs it, it shouldn't be a global
[14:48:17] <Thedarkb1-Work> I have logic to decide whether to use :443 or :80
[14:48:22] <bookworm> so?
[14:48:35] <bookworm> then pass that logic the server
[14:48:40] <Thedarkb1-Work> It isn't global, it's declared locally in the setup function.
[14:49:40] <Thedarkb1-Work> If I do the := in an if statement, won't the variable be local to that if body?
[14:49:50] <bookworm> show your actual code
[14:50:13] <bookworm> you are using the nil pointer from the declaration or at least it looks that way
[14:52:00] <Thedarkb1-Work> https://dpaste.com/D4QHTXTC7
[14:52:16] <Thedarkb1-Work> Wait, you're right
[14:52:24] <Thedarkb1-Work> I fat fingered a boolean in an if statement.
[14:53:01] <Thedarkb1-Work> That should be == "" rather than != ""
[14:53:07] <Thedarkb1-Work> ie no SSL cert.
[14:53:29] <Thedarkb1-Work> Sorry about that.
[14:53:48] <bookworm> Just init the server with the common options and only modify the other ones in the conditionals
[14:54:05] <bookworm> the only thing you need to change is the Addr, so just modify that from the original struct
[14:54:25] <bookworm> also, the server has a ListenAndServeTLS method just like the global one, so use the server either way
[14:54:33] <bookworm> you always want to init the timeouts anyhow
[14:55:07] <Thedarkb1-Work> I learned about this after this worked flawlessly for months before suddenly exhausting its file handles with my phone on silent thanks to people closing their laptops in coffee shops or some similar issue.

[16:12:36] <mickey8> like to test for when the input is longer than maxSize or whatever
