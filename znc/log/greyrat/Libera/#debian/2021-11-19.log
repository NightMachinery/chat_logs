[00:07:48] <OzFalcon> Perhaps the build deps should include libswresample-dev as well?
[00:08:16] <greycat> did libavresample4 actually get linked into any of the binary programs in the package you're looking at, with the secret name, which makes it very very hard to refer to it?
[00:08:42] <greycat> ... oh and now you're bringing up another issue.  Is this even a Debian source package?
[00:09:43] <OzFalcon> Ah, NO this is just a source package with what appears to be an older "debian" folder.
[00:10:01] <greycat> if it's a third party source package, you need to talk to the authors/maintainers about it
[00:10:17] <OzFalcon> So it could well be missing the correct packge-dev build depends.

[03:09:16] <Hash> I'm trying to install netinst bullseye on proxmox vm of 256mb RAM
[03:09:23] <Hash> Minimal requiremens say 256
[03:09:56] <Hash> I am told on a red screen that I hav einsufficient memory and it won't insatall
[03:10:31] <Khepra> Hash: you can debootstrap it if the installer refuses thinking there's insufficient RAM. Then again, you can't really do much with 256MB these days, except headless server-y thingies.
[03:10:46] <Hash> Khepra: correct in my use case assumption
[03:11:08] <Hash> headless server-y thingies
[03:12:42] <Hash> If the installer runs in low memory mode, it is recommended to create a relatively large swap partition (64‚Äì128MB). The swap partition will be used as virtual memory and thus increases the amount of memory available to the system. The installer will activate the swap partition as early as possible in the installation process. Note that heavy use of swap will reduce performance of your system and
[03:12:45] <Hash> may lead to high disk activity.
[03:12:55] <Hash> Is there a debian distro for tiny computers?
[03:13:04] <Hash> Official
[03:13:18] <Khepra> yes: debian. why don't you debootstrap it?
[03:13:35] <Hash> I'm unsure how. I'm booting a prox mox vm with debian iso netinst
[03:14:02] <Hash> And the machine is given only 256mb of ram. So I'm not sure what to boot and how to debootstrap onto that.
[03:14:22] <Hash> lowmem=1 gives kernel panic :)

[03:16:20] <n4dir> i don't know what were the official requirements, nor what proxmox is. Just shooting an idea
[03:16:30] <Khepra> debootstrap takes a directory and unpacks a base system on it, via critical system packages. which means you have to partition, mkfs, mount, debootstrap, then chroot (properly) to finalize installation by installing grub, kernel, setting root passwd, unpriv user optionally, openssh-server, network config, locale, timezone.
[03:17:30] <Khepra> sounds a mouthful, but it's very simple really, once you get the hang of it. it's my favorite installation method, not only because I require zfs rootfs atop of luks which the installer can't even do :)
[03:17:44] <n4dir> also some distros are focused on very low memory systems, and you could install debootstrap on them. Most major distros have it in the repositories, i wouldn't know if those special distros have it too
[03:17:54] <Hash> Ok
[03:17:56] <Hash> Thanks
[03:18:15] <n4dir> i know slitaz and tiny core system, but don't really know them well enough.
[03:18:33] <Khepra> there's also debian based specialized "rescue" environments from which you can debootstrap, like grml
[03:18:43] *** Quits: sinaowolabi_ (~SinaOwola@102.134.114.1) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[03:18:48] <n4dir> yeah, probably i'd try grml first
[03:18:55] <Khepra> but n4dir is correct, needn't be debian, many distros pacakge debootstrap
[03:19:32] <n4dir> gotta say that i am a bit "shocked" that you can't make the netinst boot with 256 MB.
[03:19:49] <Khepra> also... something something puppy linux.
[03:20:21] <n4dir> Khepra: both you mentioned are sure better known than slitaz and tiny core. Better options, in my book
[03:21:33] <n4dir> doesn't help much to have a distro which does it in theory, but no one can give you a hand.
[03:21:45] <Khepra> so question. is this a rented VM? or can you give it a GB of RAM, install, then drop down to 256MB, if you control the host?

[03:25:29] <Hash> No can do. Goal is to rent a 128mb or 256mb vps and install debian for a very specific 1 service only. Bind9 slave.

[10:09:30] <Hash> no need to  erase

[10:09:53] <dpkg> Information about the development of the debian-installer is at the developers page http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/ .  If you want to make custom install CDs, start with d-i.  IRC: #debian-boot on irc.oftc.net.  See also <errata>, <g-i>.
[10:09:56] <maximilian90> I just informed myself again and I can actually erase it lol
[10:10:16] <Hash> from which os?
[10:10:29] <maximilian90> I use Windows 10 right now
[10:10:33] <Hash> If linux, just copy the debian iso cp or dd to the usb /dev device
[10:10:58] <WormFood> maximilian90, you want to install debian from or to the usb drive?
[10:11:06] <Hash> You can use Rufus
[10:11:19] <somiaj> Hash: I thought there was some tricks to chain load a debian.iso with grub (due to its hybrid nature)
[10:11:29] <WormFood> There are several winblows tools, that can help you make a usb installer.
[10:11:32] <Hash> https://people.debian.org/~rmh/goodbye-microsoft/ does this still workon 10?
[10:12:06] <Hash> so hybrid actually means that you can put it on usb adn/or burn it on iso9660 cd rom
[10:12:10] <somiaj> maximilian90: you aren't clear, do you want install on the usb, or copy the installer to the usb to install on some other drive?
[10:12:16] <Hash> otherwise iso are only either cdrom or usb.
[10:12:20] <Hash> debian is both, which is good.
[10:12:32] <somiaj> !rufus
[10:12:32] <dpkg> rufus is a tool that can be used to make bootable USB devices under Windows. Debian CD/DVD images MUST be written in "DD Mode," otherwise it mangles the installer in cruel and unusual ways, resulting in hard to debug problems.  Ask me about <hybrid images>, <usb install>, <win32diskimager>.
[10:12:50] <maximilian90> Sorry, I have Windows 10 right now and I want to install Debian 10 on my laptop to have both on it (Windows 10 and Debian, I think it is called dual boot). To do that, I thought I could put Debian 10 on the USB drive, shutdown my computer, put the USB drive into my laptop and then from there install it next to Windows
[10:12:51] <somiaj> Be careful with rufus, make sure it is in DD mode, and tehre was someone eariler who was having trouble wiht it
[10:13:23] <WormFood> maximilian90, sure you can do that.
[10:13:39] <somiaj> maximilian90: Your termonology is just incorrect, you are not putting debian 10 on a usb drive, you are putting the installer on the usb drive, which is different, and then yes you can use the installer to install debian on a second partition to dual boot with windows
[10:13:47] <somiaj> maximilian90: also why debian 10? I would suggest using debian 11.
[10:14:16] <somiaj> and from windows I suggest using win32diskimager to write the debian.iso to the usb drive, though rufus in DD mode can work
[10:14:20] <somiaj> !win32diskimager
[10:14:20] <dpkg> win32diskimager is much more reliable than <rufus> or <etcher> for copying ISO images to USB sticks and you can download it from https://sf.net/projects/win32diskimager/ .  Adjust the file mask from *.img to *.* if it doesn't show Debian .iso images.  See <usb install> and <install debian> for further details.
[10:14:28] <maximilian90> Ah okay sorry for wrong terminology, I try my best to express myself on point
[10:15:01] <somiaj> maximilian90: no problem, I just wanted to be clear what you wanted to do, and yes this is the standard approach, copy the debian.iso installer to a usb drive, then use it to install on your laptop.
[10:15:30] <somiaj> If you are using the net install and want to isntall over wifi, there is another small issue here, due to non-free firmware
[10:15:38] <somiaj> You may want to use the firmware installer for this
[10:15:40] <somiaj> !firmware images
[10:15:40] <dpkg> There are <live> system and <netinst> and DVD images containing non-free Debian <firmware> packages available from https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/current/amd64/iso-cd/ The images are "unofficial" because "official Debian" includes only 100% free software, but otherwise identical to the normal installer images and prepared by the same Debian Developers. See <check iso>, <old firmware images>.
[10:16:32] <maximilian90> Okay I will then download the Debian 11 iso and putting the installer on the USB drive via win32diskimager. What's the net install?
[10:16:57] <WormFood> net install will install all the packages from the Internet, so everything is up-to-date
[10:17:02] <somiaj> It is just a small installer that contains only a base system, then downloads all additional software from the network during the install
[10:17:20] <somiaj> WormFood: well not all, it does contain a base system which can be installed without any network connection.
[10:17:43] <maximilian90> Ah, I can choose that when I install debian 11 on my laptop? It will be an option?
[10:17:57] <WormFood> but you can't do much with it. A minimal system, so you can install the whole system
[10:18:19] <somiaj> maximilian90: the install will install the base system, and then it will ask you for additional software, at that point you can choose what desktop if any you want to install and a few other options.
[10:18:27] <somiaj> though most stuff you'll just install with apt once the install is complete
[10:18:28] <WormFood> I also recommend the non-official net installer...what's the exact wording they use? It has additional "non-free" network drivers.
[10:18:50] <somiaj> Yea, I liked the firmware images, you'll most likely need this to get wifi working and some gpus

[10:36:31] <maximilian90> Yeah I don't care much about which drivers it uses, as long as all the things from my laptop work I guess

[10:39:10] <Cool_Fire> Having said that, the "unofficial" image is totally fine and shouldn't give you any problems.
[10:39:56] <Cool_Fire> I'm guessing here, but I think it's mostly classed "unofficial" for legal & licensing reasons as it is otherwise completely identical to the normal install image

[12:13:06] <maximilian90> hey, I successfully installed Debian 11 on my laptop but I have one minor problem, simply touching my mousepad doesn't work as "left clicking" anymore, only when I "hardpress" it, it seems to do the clicking. It's not a big issue but I wonder if this can be resolved? Didn't find much help on this with Google
[12:14:05] <WormFood> that feature, if I'm not mistaken, is called "tap to click". Search for that term, and see what you come up with
[12:15:27] <maximilian90> Ah, I found it, it works now. I didn't know how it is called. Thank you WormFood

[12:34:51] <Khepra> And speaking of gtk3, and by gtk3 I mean QT ... you asked how keepassxc breaks for me under sway/wayland. Like this:  top broken, bottom how it should look like:   https://imgur.com/a/HGZELXi
[12:35:15] <Haohmaru> so i installed some gtk themes, found a few that look nice to me (LXDE), they support overriding the colors from "Customize Look and Feel" great.. they apply to most of LXDE things like pcmanfm and so on, but synaptic, and lxterminal have this horrible scrollbar which i hate
[12:36:11] <Haohmaru> Khepra huh, so basically there's no text, besides those questionmarks, which might be icons actually
[12:36:42] <Haohmaru> and the text entry fields are gone
[12:36:49] <Khepra> yes and doesn't react to clicks. ctrl-q does close the application
[12:37:17] <Khepra> it's just one big broken mess... and speaking of that.... is lxterminal a QT thingy? synaptic too? methinks, if yes, then that's the qt-gtk3 integration theming failure.

[12:39:14] <Khepra> I think we should all agree that desktop GNU/linux is a big, irreversible, unfixable mess, and stop trying  :)
[12:39:34] <Khepra> Haohmaru: but the scrolls in your pic are gtk3 scrolls
[12:39:47] <Haohmaru> in lxterminal, the scrollbar is always there but still looks like a thick rounded line, has no buttons at the ends
[12:40:12] <Khepra> Haohmaru: you use firefox?
[12:40:15] <Haohmaru> yes
[12:40:19] <Khepra> it has the same scrolls, no?
[12:40:28] <Haohmaru> firefox has those vanishing scrollbars too
[12:40:32] <Khepra> yeah. gtk3.
[12:40:46] <Haohmaru> but i think some websites can "choose" different scrollbars, so i can't tell wtf's going on
[12:41:08] <Khepra> I've seen sites somehow control the color of _selection_ but never scrollbars, at least never in Firefox.
[12:41:38] <Haohmaru> i don't know tbh
[12:41:47] <Khepra> not saying it's not possible, just saying I've never seen it, and Firefox is 24/7 app on my desk tops. in multiple instances. it's my $dayjob :)
[12:42:07] <Haohmaru> so i just launched firefox, opened the "History" and it has the ugly scrollbar but no animations on it at least
[12:42:45] <Haohmaru> now i think the synaptic website content might be old
[12:43:45] <Khepra> you think "Last change: 07. Januar 2009" might support that theory?  :))
[12:44:13] <Khepra> if we're talking about nongnu.org/synaptic which afaik is teh official site

[15:06:37] <Haohmaru> i can only do a few very basic things with apt

[15:07:40] <Hash> Sometimes I use synapti.
[15:07:50] <Hash> rarely, but i do. There are usecases.
[15:08:05] <Hash> Sometimes a gui is just easier. With mouse clicky.
[15:08:22] <Haohmaru> for the upgrading - i follow the upgrade instructions because i don't wanna mess things up, i know how to do basic installing, i would use that if i have to install a bunch of packages at once which i know the names of
[15:08:26] <Haohmaru> so that's rarely
[15:09:02] <Hash> I like will go through synaptic, search things mark everything as to be isntalled, and let it go.
[15:09:07] <Hash> You can't do that on terminal.
[15:09:07] <Haohmaru> synaptic is like a GUI catalog, there's descriptions, information, screenshots, more details..
[15:09:21] <Hash> You have to go tediously on terminal.
[15:09:30] <Hash> Oh yeah, synaptic is wonderful.
[15:09:45] <matik> !dpkg aptitude
[15:09:45] <dpkg> hmm... aptitude is a terminal-based package manager that can be used in a command-line mode (aptitude install foo ; aptitude remove goo) as well as a text user interface mode (just run "aptitude").  Ask me about <why aptitude> <why not aptitude> <aptitude-fu> <aptitude docs> or see http://wiki.debian.org/Aptitude or http://tinyurl.com/3g4d4d9.
[15:09:51] <Haohmaru> i know that everything synaptic does is done under the hood via invoking the different CLI things
[15:10:01] <Hash> Aptitude as I hear is deprecated in favor of apt.
[15:10:05] <Hash> Dependency resolution issues.
[15:10:34] <Haohmaru> !synaptic
[15:10:34] <dpkg> Synaptic is a graphical user interface to add, remove and reinstall packages.  It has dependency handling just like apt-get and integrates well with apt-get (also behaves well with aptitude too).  http://wiki.debian.org/Synaptic  http://wiki.debian.org/HowToSynaptic .  Not to be confused with the <synaptics> touchpad driver.
[15:10:59] <Hash> If you like it, use it.
[15:11:14] <Haohmaru> synaptic comes with LXDE, and i love it

[15:11:27] <Haohmaru> oh, also, you can edit your sources.list from it

[15:16:01] <Haohmaru> yeah i thought aptitude is like a the TUI "synaptic" but i think it also has more fancy CLI functions
[15:16:14] <n4dir> iirc there have been times when you were advised to use either aptitude or apt-get, but mixing them might cause problems. That is ages ago though
[15:16:21] <Haohmaru> however, i haven't used aptitude much, it also doesn't come installed by default
[15:16:38] <jkc> n4dir: I think they used to resolve dependencies differently or something.
[15:16:45] <n4dir> i usually install it for exactly one purpose: aptitude why
[15:17:02] <n4dir> though aptitude wizards always impressed me. You don't run in them often anymore

[20:29:54] <PerfDave> RonWhoCares: Including the [ characters?
[20:30:17] <RonWhoCares> The string I am needing to search for is     ['master']
[20:30:20] <PerfDave> [ has special meaning to grep, so you'll probably want "\['master'\]"
[20:30:47] <somiaj> ahh yea, since it does regex by default, I also think there is a flag you can use to just match vs regex
[20:30:58] <PerfDave> echo "This is the ['master'] copy" | grep --color "\['master'\]"
[20:31:29] <somiaj> Looks like there is -F, --fixed-strings, which may also work
[20:31:34] <PerfDave> somiaj: grep -F or fgrep
[20:31:41] <PerfDave> $ echo "This is the ['master'] copy" | grep --color -F "['master']"
[20:31:50] <somiaj> PerfDave: you don't have to double escape since \[ would just be the escape in the shell?

[21:04:18] <jkc> ani^: You have to do the reverse so that each dependency is removed. Also, I would suggest (if you have a single drive) creating the encrypted volume first, THEN putting LVM on top.
[21:04:25] <amacater_> Reboot using the installer disk then re-enter the partitioner - at that point, nothing should be mounted
[21:05:15] <amacater_> If you take the partitioner's default for an encrypted drive, it offers encrypted LVM which is what you want, I think.
