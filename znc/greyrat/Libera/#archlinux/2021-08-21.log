[00:09:03] <MrElendig> indeed
[00:09:09] <vn971> Hi. I have a question. On latest upgrade of my system, the screen started to flicker in certain applications. Example: firefox URL bar, quasselIRC (Qt, the menu glitches), doublecmd-gtk (it glitches when going up or down in file list), kate (Qt, the menu glitches).
[00:09:09] <vn971> The glitch is that many small horizontal lines appear, and the gradually disappear over the course of few seconds.
[00:09:09] <vn971> The glitch ONLY happens when I do not enable a compositor. If I either start `picom` (former `compton`) or XFCE-s built-in compositor, the bug disappears
[00:09:09] <vn971> Example of windows that never flicker are xfce4-terminal, pidgin, telegram-desktop (that one is Qt, but it doesn't have a classical menu), bless editor.
[00:09:09] <MrElendig> tip: use the portable flag

[01:52:05] <damarusama> I'm always confused with the chroot, I only use it when installing arch, then forget all about it
[01:52:15] <tirnanog> forever seems a little dramatic but, if you're just trying to fix the root password from some arbirarty existing linux installation, I suppose it makes sense.

[01:52:57] <thurstylark> well, being confused about a new thing is totally valid, but imo chroot is one of those tools that's worth having at least a cursory understanding of in general
[01:53:21] <tirnanog> oh, I agree.
[01:53:24] <damarusama> yeah as well as 120 bash and linux command
[01:53:35] <thurstylark> like, I know you're currently in ack-fix-the-thing mode at the moment, so whatever, just my 2 cents :P
[01:54:22] <tirnanog> I'd even go as far as to say it's useful to know how to set one up in a situation where the ever-helpful arch-chroot script isn't handy.
[01:54:22] <damarusama> heheh yep totally - I know of chroot, and will use it at some point, but it's like step parents, you see them because you have to

[10:51:23] <dagle> ishitatsuyuki: I bet it depends on how it's implemented. maybe fstrim is a background job on windows where on linux it returns when complete. Or unlink on windows does trimming, making the unlink function really slow. 
[10:51:42] <ishitatsuyuki> I guess it's probably the latter

[16:04:07] <another|> is your phone running x86-64 ?
[16:04:08] <Namarrgon> Llamamoe: do you have an x86_64 phone?

[16:06:12] <Llamamoe> Ah thank you :-)
[16:06:14] <Namarrgon> but they might not want to support that usecase either
[16:06:22] <alad> is it even possible to set up any subsystem in new android phones anyway
[16:06:33] <alad> because they disallow exec() 
[16:06:45] <Llamamoe> alad: Yeah, there's apps for it and I've seen some app-independent guides (that require a rooted device, which is fine with me)
[16:06:54] <Llamamoe> But they typically revolve around setting up Debian 
[16:07:03] <alad> termux used to work
[16:07:32] <alad> maybe if you can use some old SDK version, it still might
[16:07:41] <Llamamoe> E.g. LinuxDeploy(requires root, uses chroot), Termux
[16:08:04] <Llamamoe> I had some issues with LinuxDeploy though, don't remember what went wrong but didn't know how to debug it

[22:55:34] <nova> When I press the fan button on my laptop, I don't really know what happens, but I guess it connects to the firmware to toggle between two fan settings. I did run powertop, once (NOT with the -c/--calibrate flag), and I feel like the fan doesn't work the same. Could powertop have configured something against my consent?
[22:55:47] <teraflops> that installer if I'm not wrong is focused in automating the process more than it being a tradicional installer
[22:56:14] <teraflops> fan button TIL

[22:56:45] <Erus_Iluvatar> Yup my wife's MSI laptop has one
[22:56:50] <nova> Honestly, I am scared of powertop -c. I think I did that once a while ago, and it messed some things up, and I never cared to properly learn how to unbreak everything. That was on a different install on a different laptop, though
[22:57:04] <teraflops> powertop wont mess anything
[22:57:27] <teraflops> because you have to apply any changes powertop is suggesting one my one
