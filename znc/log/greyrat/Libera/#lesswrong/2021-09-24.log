[02:04:44] <kuudes> The CDC is now meeting to consider who should have the ability to get booster shots, not withstanding the FDA already having made that same decision. And they are being explicit that the point of vaccination, according to the CDC, they are now claiming, is to prevent hospitalization and death and NOT to prevent infection.

[04:09:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Reading this ACX post about Tartaria... I haven't gotten all the way through the explanations for the change in aesthetics of the elite, but there seems to be at least one obvious hypothesis:
[04:11:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> What kinds of things people see as beautiful is constant across history (modulo some spatiotemporally local variations that don't really depart from the basic patterns). As technology (broadly speaking) and wealth (to spend the excess on aesthetics) advanced, we became more and more adept at producing what is beautiful, and as we reached the apex of that skill, it simultaneously became ever cheaper to produce the approximately
[04:11:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> -maximally-beautiful things. But this meant that producing beautiful things became less and less a reliable signal of wealth.
[04:12:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> A new signal had to be found, and by definition it had to involve producing things that were *not* maximally beautiful; and, indeed, for best effectiveness as a wealth signal, it had to be very distinct from the beautiful stuff.
[04:12:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> The end.
[04:12:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> That seems to explain what we see...
[04:12:56] * Obormot\Arcturus keeps reading to see if Scott mentions this theory
[04:17:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Riffing off this "split between art and mass culture" - it also seems significant that architecture is often government-funded, and so we see that "split" pattern in it that mirror those in poetry, art, etc.
[04:18:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> This observation implies a theory (left as black box for now) which would predict that non-government-funded manifestations of the phenomenon to be explained would be more rare and/or less severe, and... scrolling back up to the pix...
[04:19:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... we can observe that the "Bill Gates's receiving room" pic seems... at least noticeably less bad than many of the other examples

Usually Brummell's gambling obligations, as "debts of honour", were paid immediately. The one exception to this was the final wager, dated March 1815 in White's betting book, which was marked "not paid, 20th January, 1816".[28] He lived the remainder of his life in French exile, spending
[04:57:52] <feepbot> ten years in Calais without an official passport before acquiring an appointment to the consulate at Caen in 1830 through the influence of Lord Alvanley and the Duke of Beaufort. This provided him with a small annuity but lasted only two years, when the Foreign Office took Brummell's recommendation to abolish the consulate. He had made it in the hope of being appointed to a more
[04:57:52] <feepbot> remunerative position elsewhere, but no new position was forthcoming. Rapidly running out of money and grown increasingly slovenly in his dress, he was forced into debtors' prison in early 1835 by his long-unpaid Calais creditors; only through the charitable intervention of his friends in England was he able to secure release later that year. In 1840 Brummell died penniless and
[04:57:57] <feepbot> insane from syphilis at Le Bon Sauveur Asylum on the outskirts of Caen; he was 61.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Brummell guessing the corpse wasn't very beautiful, but he did die surprisingly old

[07:35:31] <Robomot> Ern Malley hoax - Wikipedia (The Ern Malley hoax, also called the Ern Malley affair, is Australia's most famous literary hoax.[ …)
[07:35:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Its name derives from Ernest Lalor "Ern" Malley, a fictitious poet whose biography and body of work were created in one day in 1943 by conservative writers James McAuley and Harold Stewart in order to hoax the Angry Penguins, a modernist art and literary movement centred around a journal of the same name, co-edited by poet Max Harris and art patron John Reed, of Heide, Melbourne.
[07:35:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Imitating the modernist poetry they despised, the hoaxers deliberately created what they thought was bad verse and mailed sixteen poems to Harris under the guise of Ethel, Ern Malley's surviving sister."
[07:35:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Cool, cool, and the result?
[07:36:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Harris and other members of the Heide Circle fell for the hoax, and, enraptured by the poetry, devoted the next issue of Angry Penguins to Malley, hailing him as a genius. The hoax was revealed soon after, resulting in a cause célèbre and the humiliation of Harris, who was put on trial, convicted and fined for publishing the poems on the grounds that they contained obscene content. Angry Penguins folded in 1946."
[07:36:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Home run
[07:36:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fucking nailed it
[07:36:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In the decades that followed, the hoax proved to be a significant setback for modernist poetry in Australia." ... amazing
[07:37:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The South Australian police prosecuted Harris for publishing immoral and obscene material. The only prosecution witness was a police detective, whose evidence included the statement 'I don't know what "incestuous" means, but I think there is a suggestion of indecency about it'". Despite this, and several distinguished expert witnesses arguing for Harris, he was found guilty and fined £5.[13] Angry Penguins soon folded. " ...

[10:05:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> "As far as I’m concerned, universities are where you go to learn how to read Akkadian cuneiform tablets, the scansion of Ovid, and stuff like that." ... this is not representative of the whole essay (which is much worse, idea-wise), but wow
[10:05:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, yeah, those things are interesting, and we should totally have places where people go to learn them
[10:06:43] <quanticle> >Here is why I actually think humanistic inquiry should be defended: because it elevates the human spirit.
[10:06:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> But, like, this means that university is totally without value for most people
[10:06:59] <quanticle> No, no, I think you were on the right track by suggesting that the humanities were a hobby for the privileged
[10:07:19] <feep[work]> humanities are status signaling for societies
[10:07:46] <quanticle> But who are we signalling to? The Chinese? They don't give a shit.
[10:08:00] <feep[work]> unfortunately, societies are also adaptation-executors, not value maximizers~
[10:08:23] <feep[work]> well, maybe fortunately
[10:08:35] <feep[work]> the western world just likes feeling pretty~
[10:08:44] <quanticle> Okay, let's roll it back then. In 1640-whenever, when Harvard was founded, who exactly was being signalled to?
[10:09:03] <feep[work]> 1640 may still be too late
[10:09:19] <feep[work]> hm tho maybe
[10:09:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_of_Seville
[10:09:26] <feep[work]> I'd assume like, britain, france..
[10:09:27] <Robomot> Isidore of Seville - Wikipedia (Isidore of Seville (/ˈɪzɪdɔːr/; Latin: Isidorus Hispalensis; c. 560 – 4 April 636) was a Spanish scholar and cleric. For over three decades, he was Archbishop of Seville. He is widely regarded, in the words of 19th-century historian Montalembert, as "the last scholar of the ancient world".[2] …)
[10:09:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> "His fame after his death was based on his Etymologiae, an etymological encyclopedia that assembled extracts of many books from classical antiquity that would have otherwise been lost. He also invented the period (full stop), comma, and colon.[4]" ... !!!
[10:10:43] <quanticle> Anyway, maybe I'm at odds with this channel, but I this essay is extremely dumb
[10:11:12] <feep[work]> eh, I'm sort of playing along with it anyway
[10:11:25] <feep[work]> all theses based on signaling are false anyways, and meditation is on thin ice too
[10:11:59] <quanticle> It's like this person is *this close* to realizing that their life's work is meaningless, that humanities serve no practical purpose and never have, but at the last second they turn away and veer off into some pseudo-mystical bullshit about the value of the humanities being inherently good for the human soul or some shit.
[10:12:09] <feep[work]> so, you know, "universities are centers of meditation ... for the purpose of signaling!" is just, spicy
[10:12:26] <feep[work]> quanticle: no that's not at all what they're saying
[10:12:44] <feep[work]> or rather, inherently is doing way too much work there
[10:12:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Yes, I concur
[10:12:53] <feep[work]> like, food isn't inherently good for the body
[10:13:02] <feep[work]> that food is good for the body is due to a relation between properties of food and of the body
[10:13:16] <feep[work]> food is not imbued with goodness, food is imbued with nutrients. :p
[10:13:52] <feep[work]> I think the author would likewise strongly reject the notion that universities are innately imbued with goodness
[10:13:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: When reading that essay, the thought I kept having was "this person is clearly intelligent and thoughtful and it is just such a shame that her intellect is being so thoroughly wasted"
[10:13:58] <feep[work]> (because he says so, in the article)
[10:14:05] <feep[work]> she*?
[10:14:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm
[10:14:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now I'm unsure
[10:14:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok he
[10:14:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> I thought that said "Justine" but it says "Justin E."
[10:14:54] <feep[work]> "ok he" is the feminist equivalent of "ok boomer"
[10:15:38] <feep[work]> quanticle: anyway, the assertion the article makes is that humanities are useful because they expose you to and force you to conceptualize artifacts way outside of your lifestyle
[10:15:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Justin Erik Halldór Smith, it seems)
[10:16:20] <feep[work]> quanticle: which, one would think, could maybe be done cheaper by airdropping the student at a random point on the globe
[10:16:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... he has an asteroid named after him, gosh
[10:16:43] <feep[work]> but I suppose the distance in time is also relevant
[10:17:47] <feep[work]> anyway, in that sense ironically universities are supposed to be inherently discordian
[10:18:03] <feep[work]> disrupt people's reality tunnels, evoke neophilia, etc
[10:18:24] <feep[work]> this is, of course, not how it turns out in practice, but we may imagine this better world and enjoy its fading image~
[10:18:37] <nshepperd2> quanticle: 'constant entreaties and attempted seduction' is this based on that one sjw vs nazi explanations meme
[10:19:11] <quanticle> feep[work]: Calculus forces me to conceptualize artifacts that are way outside my lifestyle too. Heck, I have literally never once put together a series of mixing tanks like I had to in my differential equations class. But the difference is, differential equations are (somewhat) useful for things that I do use. Whereas my knowledge of when the Peace of Westphalia happened? Yeah, that's cool, but
[10:19:13] <quanticle> honestly the only thing it does is make me look cool on IRC.
[10:19:21] <feep[work]> quanticle: yeah but calculus leaves your moral framework untouched
[10:19:21] <nshepperd2> quanticle: ah, this one https://imgur.com/C9US5Tz
[10:19:33] <feepbot> Accurate - Imgur (84883 views on Imgur: The magic of the Internet)
[10:19:41] <feep[work]> quanticle: in fact, arguably its problem is that it *is* useful
[10:20:12] <feep[work]> the state of being useful is equivalent to being digested by the mind
[10:20:13] <nshepperd2> how come google is great at finding memes based on a vague and incoherent description of the contents and terrible at anything actually useful
[10:20:37] <feep[work]> quanticle: whereas the point of the version of humanities espoused here is exactly to be indigestible, to force mental trauma
[10:21:05] <feep[work]> if they fit comfortably in your worldview, the university has failed.
[10:21:16] <feep[work]> again, analogize this to the use of koans in meditation.
[10:21:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I believe that everyone, _for the sake of their own thriving as human beings_, should be required to study at university only things that have nothing to do with their own life up until that point."
[10:21:44] <nshepperd2> humanities: literally the Book from Anathem
[10:21:51] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: That, but unironically.
[10:21:59] <quanticle> "Please indicate on the doll where the humanities touched your moral framework"
[10:22:04] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: well, I'd say the Book is the anti-humanities
[10:22:17] <feep[work]> using the toolset for evil rather than good
[10:22:35] <cpopell> I've been getting satisfaction from the classical humanities
[10:22:38] <feep[work]> but its description does point at the thing the humanities are meant to be, yes.
[10:22:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: That's an quote from the guy
[10:22:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> *an actual quote
[10:22:52] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: oh great
[10:23:00] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: thanks, that confirms my description then~
[10:24:05] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: like, the point of the Book vs humanities is humanities are like pruning a tree to make it sprout more, and the Book is like pruning a tree and then charring the stump so it won't grow
[10:24:17] <nshepperd2> but are they actually??
[10:24:22] <feep[work]> fuck no
[10:24:30] <cpopell> as it is today? no.
[10:24:33] <feep[work]> again, this is an illusory idea of a distant dream
[10:24:34] <cpopell> you can study them on your own though
[10:26:50] <quanticle> feep[work]: But okay, ponder this: what if forcing people to reconsider their moral frameworks is actually bad?
[10:27:21] <feep[work]> quanticle: then universities are bad, yes
[10:27:45] <feep[work]> which is of course also a big part of why autocratic countries tend to not like humanities
[10:27:47] <quanticle> And leads to people like... doing what rationalists do and trying to reinvent social intuitions from base principles, doing it poorly, concluding those intuitions have no value, and then going off in some horrible direction as a result
[10:27:51] <cpopell> Hot take: A good study of humanities clarifies and strengthens nearly any worldview brought to it.
[10:28:07] <feep[work]> quanticle: "leads to people doing what rationalists do" is supposed to be an argument for why they're bad, um
[10:28:08] <cpopell> A bad study of humanities allows the authority to impose its worldview on you.
[10:28:21] <cpopell> both authoritarian govts and universities are bad studies of humanities
[10:28:39] <quanticle> cpopell: Cold take; of course you can selectively read history and the classics to justify whatever you want. Heck, you don't even need to go that far; the Bible is sufficient.
[10:28:42] <cpopell> (this is not a seriously considered position I thought about it for thirty seconds, but now I have to ponder it)
[10:29:05] <feep[work]> I think universities as they exist are bad studies, but even the fragments of good that shine through generate threat to autocracies
[10:29:07] <cpopell> @quanticle  that's basically exactly what I'm saying - not just justify, but think clearly and more rigorously about any value set you start with
[10:29:29] <quanticle> Hmmmm...
[10:29:35] <quanticle> Okay, I think I see where you're going with that
[10:29:58] <cpopell> I read (most of) Augustine of Hippo
[10:30:00] <quanticle> Like, reading the humanities to see how people way smarter than you'll ever be have both argued for and against your position
[10:30:03] <cpopell> or his most major works
[10:30:07] <cpopell> and it just left my atheism more intense
[10:30:14] <cpopell> a Catholic would get a different experience
[10:30:18] <feep[work]> as jor-el say in man of steel: "you, rationalists, will give mankind an ideal to strive towards. they will struggle, they will falter, but in time they will join you in the mud of skepticism"
[10:31:05] <feep[work]> "in time, you will help them, completely confuse themselves and go off and do something totally asinine."
[10:31:08] <feep[work]> but with dramatic music
[10:31:09] <cpopell> the most interesting part of Augustine is, uhhh

[10:49:02] <kuudes> but yeah, biologically I suppose we just have need for cognition re process iq and verbal iq and humanities are the product of the nfc of verbal side
[10:49:05] <kuudes> ie bloggers
[10:51:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: lol wtf
[10:51:34] <quanticle> kuudes: My takeaway from that essay is that Elua is as much of a primal driving force as Moloch. It seems to me that as long as we have people, we'll have art. In fact, you could make the argument that by choosing a particular incentive structure and applying at mass scale across the humanities, the universities are agents of Moloch, rather than Elua.
[10:52:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Elua is fake and Moloch is real, so I disagree with that essay
[10:52:21] <quanticle> And that the correct thing to do, if you want the humanities to flourish, is to take them out of the hands of university administrators and put them back in the hands of the idle rich who originally cared deeply about them.
[10:52:44] <kuudes> well, it is just the centralize-decentralize cycle from dilbert, I suppose
[10:52:52] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Well, sure, but I was making the argument taking the premises as given.
[10:53:50] <kuudes> I mean, isn't lesswrong in itself a humanities thing, sort of?
[10:54:06] <kuudes> this whole aspiring toward rationality etc
[10:55:06] <quanticle> "Participation in the project involved secrecy / privacy / information-management agreements. People were asked to sign an agreement that prohibited publishing almost anything (for example, in one case someone I know starting a personal blog on unrelated topics without permission led to a stern reprimand)"
[10:55:08] <quanticle> Oh, is that why Leverage was/is such a black hole? I knew of two people from Seattle who went down (Osthanes, of course, was one) to join Leverage, and, to a first approximation, I haven't heard anything of either of them since.
[10:55:33] <kuudes> how is he btw?
[10:55:48] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, I heard of leverage years ago and was excited about it
[10:55:53] <PapuaHardyNet> never heard of them since
[10:58:06] <quanticle> "The stated purpose of the group was to discover more theories of human behavior and civilization by 'theorizing', while building power, and then literally take over US and/or global governance (the vibe was 'take over the world'). The purpose of gaining global power was to lead to better coordination and better outcomes for humanity."
[10:58:07] <quanticle> This actually tracks 100% with what I heard from Osthanes about Leverage before he went to join them. The more charitable description was that Leverage sought to apply rationality techniques to build better social institutions, which could then be used to coordinate better and coordinate towards more moral ends.
[10:58:22] <quanticle> kuudes: I have literally no idea.
[10:59:10] <cpopell> leverage tried to recruit me

[11:00:00] <quanticle> My impression of Leverage is that it was pure grift; apparently Geoff managed to snooker some VCs with more money than sense (not especially difficult in the Bay Area) and managed to turn it into a rationalist group house with pretensions.
[11:00:07] <cpopell> well, kind of
[11:00:24] <quanticle> cpopell: Well, given that you're still talking to us, the effort was evidently unsuccessful

[11:00:39] <cpopell> I was not tractable enough for them to want to move on
[11:00:47] <cpopell> They needed people looking for answers/help/whatever

From what I'm reading of the linked accusations, it seems like the worst thing one can accuse Leverage of is taking money from rich people and not producing anything to show for it. Well, if Geoff Anders scams some rich people to allow a bunch of liberal arts humanities types to live in the Bay Area,
[11:14:10] <quanticle> well, I'm okay with that outcome.

[20:40:22] <pompolic> > the basic liberal idea that only I can decide what is good for me. 
[20:40:31] <pompolic> this feels like an unpopular opinion these days
[20:40:48] <feep> that's not liberalism
[20:41:17] <feep> in fact, it's anti-liberalism
[20:41:51] <feep> at least for me, liberalism says: "it's not *about* goodness, it's about autonomy and authority."
[20:42:35] <feep> "I decide what's good for me" is already the basis for authoritarianism, ie. "we can better decide what's good for you"; if you concede that it's *about* what's good for you, you have already lost the heart of it.
[20:42:47] <pompolic> ohh
[20:42:52] <pompolic> that makes sense
[20:43:26] <feep> of course, ironically, I also like liberalism because I think it's good for people.
[20:43:28] <pompolic> i have a very old cached thought that goes something like "beware of those who would claim to know what's good for you better than you do"
[20:43:37] <pompolic> and i did in fact grow up in an authoritarian hellhole
[20:43:42] <feep> "... for in his heart he dreams himself your master" :p
[20:44:04] <pompolic> it's entirely possible that i encountered that quote somewhere along the line
[20:44:05] <kuudes> hmm. so "only I can decide" is liberal, feep?
[20:44:15] <feep> well, it's more like... "I should decide."
[20:44:28] <feep> or "I decide."
[20:44:32] <kuudes> heh
[20:45:02] <kuudes> my motto has been "decide by yourself"
[20:45:04] <feep> and then ... liberalism is a set of techniques for managing a society where people understand that they are the ones who decide.
[20:45:04] <pompolic> how it was cached was me trying to find a succinct description of why i really fucking hated the people i was dealing with
[20:46:00] <feep> it exists in a kind of symbiosis with an autonomous populace.
[20:46:25] <pompolic> which feels relevant: "what's good for me" makes sense in an adversarial context where you only have access to the authoritarian frame, i guess
[20:46:31] <feep> I think I'd say it is *about* people's decisions, but not composed of them.
[20:46:36] <pompolic> which kind of sounds like restating your point, t b h
[20:46:50] <feep> pompolic: well, the thing is, in that symbiotic sense, I think liberalism genuinely is good for people who decide.
[20:46:58] <pompolic> i agree
[20:47:15] <feep> but like, the case of liberalism has always been "that's why we decide to do liberalism."
[20:47:29] <pompolic> "you can value autonomy for its sake" was uhhh, a new idea not long ago, to me
[20:47:33] <feep> <3
[20:47:46] <feep> anyway, I'mma freely decide to go have a shower bbl
[20:48:41] <feep> okay, store *then* shower
[20:48:52] <pompolic> ah, load-store architecture
[20:48:57] <pompolic> (this was funnier in my head)
[20:52:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> I agree with feep re: conceding that it's about what's good for you
[20:52:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Freedom is the freedom to make all the mistakes you want
[20:52:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Freedom is the freedom to do exactly what is worst for yourself, knowingly and deliberately
[20:53:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you don't have that, then you're not really free
[20:55:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you're only free to do what's good for yourself, then you're like the the proverbial epiphenomenal consciousness - deciding to control your body in this or that way, but without any causal link between your decisions and what actually happens, only a coincidental correspondence
[20:58:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And this is not the same thing as the notion that your idea of what's good for you may differ from the authority's idea of what's good for you; if you concede that it's merely *that*, then the authority says "fine, a reasonable concern; if you think we're wrong about what's good for you, tell us! convince us!". And there is no reliable response to that except to say "No, I decline, because I reserve the right to decide my
[20:58:18] <Obormot\Arcturus>  fate even if my decisions are in fact terrible for me, thus I have no need to convince you of anything")
[20:59:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile, lol @ Cowen's claim that the responses to his Srinivasan interview show that women "have a tougher time in the public sphere" or w/e
[21:01:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Man he is (claiming to be?) way more impressed with this woman than seems at all warranted

[21:07:18] <ggreer> I mean software that a normal person can use. I'd probably be able to roll my own, but not say... a defense lawyer who has 50 hours of footage in discovery

[21:08:28] <gwern> ggreer: I am sure there are countless commercial services happy to process your surveillance footage...
[21:08:40] <gwern> (that's basically the entire chinese computer vision industry in a nutshell)
[21:10:31] <kuudes> change detection at least seems handleable

[21:13:12] <saturn2> freedom is useless and bad, since you only need it if you want to do something harmful

[22:25:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> tl;dr: light corn syrup is just corn syrup (Karo makes it with vanilla added), as distinct from "dark corn syrup" which is the same but with added molasses; lite corn syrup has the sweetener substitutes

[22:32:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: The point is people doing things that are bad *for them*, not bad *for you*
[22:32:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Stopping people from doing things that are bad for you is an entirely different question/problem
[22:32:47] <saturn2> ok, but at most i would be indifferent
[22:32:56] <saturn2> if i don't care about them at all
[22:33:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Correct, the first-order best-case response to other people wanting this freedom is indifference
[22:33:26] <saturn2> if i do care about them, i would want them not to have freedom
[22:33:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not true
[22:33:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you do care about them then you should want to satisfy their preferences
[22:34:32] <saturn2> how does satisfying there preferences relate to their doing bad things?
[22:34:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Directly? If they want to do bad things
[22:35:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> But more important than that is the second-order consequences: if we insist on exactly this kind of strong form of freedom, then we totally absolve ourselves of having to come to any kind of agreement on value systems (insofar as those value systems disagree on what is good or bad for individuals)
[22:36:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> If people are only free to do things that are good for them then we have the herculean task of figuring out, and coming to an agreement, on what is good for people (in general and in each case)
[22:37:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> If people are also free to do things that are bad for them, then we have no need of doing that, and a huge swath of conflicts, and overhead of argument/investigation/administration/education/etc., are all eliminated in one fell swoop
[22:37:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Tremendous amounts of societal and individual resources are freed, huge quantities of deadweight loss torn out at the root
[22:37:46] <saturn2> yes... but then people also do bad things all the time
[22:38:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> (a) that's ok, the cost is much lower, (b) people will end up do bad things all the time anyway
[22:38:23] <saturn2> it's like saying the problem of being hungry can be solved by killing yourself... technically true, sure
[22:38:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not really analogous
[22:39:05] <feep> yeah but it's not your problem, nor should it be
[22:39:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed
[22:39:59] <saturn2> all that only makes sense if i never considered it to be my problem to begin with
[22:40:18] <saturn2> if i did, there's no reason to stop
[22:40:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> People making the wrong choices for themselves is manifestly not your problem except insofar as they affect you (which, as mentioned before, is a different issue)
[22:41:05] <saturn2> they pretty much always affect me
[22:41:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then you're just changing the terms of the problem
[22:41:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> The question isn't binary
[22:42:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Perhaps people doing bad things *for themselves* pretty much always affects you, and then you're licensed to care about stopping them from doing bad things for themselves - but only to the extent that it addresses the effects on you
[22:44:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> For instance, suppose I take PCP and then go on a killing spree through the neighborhood; this is bad for myself but also for my neighbors. Now, you are my neighbor, and you say: let us prevent this man from taking drugs, as it is a bad decision for himself, that also affects us! Well, but that licenses you to prevent me from taking PCP, not to prevent me from smoking a joint...
[22:44:20] <saturn2> if something doesn't affect me, it's impossible for me to know about it, and if i know about something, it has affected me
[22:44:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's rather a tendentious interpretation of "affects"
[22:45:59] *** Quits: oxide (~lambda@user/oxide) (Quit: oxide)
[22:46:27] <saturn2> what's the correct interpretation?
[22:47:23] <feep> it's not a question of correct or incorrec
[22:47:25] <feep> t
[22:47:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> (btw, one heuristic to apply is: suppose that PCP was actually harmless or beneficial to the user, perhaps a senolytic or something awesome like that, EXCEPT that it also made you go on murderous rampages; you would still want to stop it, right? Duh, of course you would, but then you'd have a much harder time of justifying it by reference to "doing harm to oneself"... but of course you wouldn't *need* to, because, duh, murder.
[22:47:27] <Obormot\Arcturus>  And that's how you know it's a legitimate reason to concern yourself with your neighbor's affairs: that if it didn't harm *them* at all, you'd still have good cause to intervene)
[22:50:17] <ggreer> I'm imagining that one comic where a guy jogs past the yard of a property rights absolutist and a single drop of sweat falls on his land and he pulls out a laser cannon and obliterates the jogger
[22:50:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Effects we have on one another below a certain threshold must be understood to be insignificant/irrelevant, else we can't have anything resembling a sane or even remotely workable society. What if I wear mirrorshades and their reflective surfaces reflect one (1) additional high-energy photon into your body, increasing your risk of cancer thereafter by 0.00000001%? Have I "affected" you and are you, on account of the
[22:50:34] <Obormot\Arcturus>  possibility of this interaction, licensed to have a say in my choice of eyewear?
[22:52:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Anyway, the important point is that if this is about selfish concern, i.e., how others' choices affect you, that is fine, but then it's entirely a red herring to talk about whether those choices are bad *for them*
[22:53:23] <saturn2> the argument that enforcement costs are too high is valid, but that only means as a practical matter i should begrudgingly allow some freedom, not that i should change my mind about not wanting it
[22:53:29] <ggreer> there's a chapter about this in david friedman's machinery of freedom
[22:54:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> We can factor this out by amending my comment to something like: freedom is the freedom to make bad choices, assuming that (and to the degree that) any choice you make does not affect other people to any worse degree than whatever other choice you'd instead make
[22:56:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: So, you have no basis with this view for advocating any restrictions of my freedom *on the basis of my choices being bad for me*; you may well have some right to restrict my freedom on the basis of those choices (regardless - note! - entirely regardless of whether they are good or bad for me) being bad for you ... and then *that* is in turn limited by enforcement costs and various other considerations
[22:57:37] <saturn2> this is, again, begging the question
[22:57:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't see how
[22:58:19] <saturn2> if i, in fact, *do* care about whether you harm yourself, why should i stop?
[22:59:48] <feep> well, the problem is that definitions of harm are wildly divergent
[22:59:57] <feep> and so it's hard to get an "anti-harm-themselves" coalition together
[23:00:17] <feep> but in theory it should be easier to get an "avoid other people keeping you from 'harming' yourself by their definition" coalition
[23:00:28] <saturn2> and that's a practical argument again
[23:00:31] <feep> and this has worked historically a bunch of times, which is why large parts of the world are now broadly liberal
[23:00:47] <feep> saturn2: well yeah, again, I like liberalism cause I think it's good for people.
[23:01:14] <saturn2> if you're saying we're condemned to have freedom because we have no choice, i would agree
[23:01:31] <feep> I'm not saying that at all
[23:01:44] <feep> I'm saying inasmuch as we have freedom, it's because freedom is an advantaged position, like any cooperate play
[23:02:31] <saturn2> right, so it doesn't matter whether we like it or not
[23:02:51] <feep> I don't think "like" and "good" are uncorrelated
[23:04:00] <feep> whence "it is good when people get what they like", ie. utilitarianism
[23:04:56] <feep> it's a molochian thing, right? like is an adaptation-executor of good.
