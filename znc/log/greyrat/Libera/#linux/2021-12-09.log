[00:01:09] <rouji> even if you manage to keep people inside their own container/vm/whatever, that's a very very hard thing to do in a way they're not going to be able to use those for botnets or whatever
[00:01:13] <MrElendig> you will have to combine it with accounting/limits
[00:01:16] <kveroneau> It uses cgroups and such just like Docker and other container tech does for isolation.
[00:01:18] <MrElendig> and preferably selinux

[00:01:51] <MrElendig> what if one of the users decides to run something that eats all cpu and ram?
[00:02:07] <kveroneau> With nspawn, you can actually use systemd's built-in accounting and limiting. :)

[03:29:29] <NeilRG> lol
[03:29:32] <matsaman> NeilRG: the normal way to use a virtualenv is to 'activate' it by sourcing the bin/activate script
[03:29:34] <NeilRG> I have to activate the venv
[03:29:37] <NeilRG> that's how I develop
[03:29:40] <matsaman> but you can also call the executable directly via its path
[03:29:46] <MrElendig> you don't have to activate it
[03:30:16] <NeilRG> I appreciate the suggestion, but that's not reasonable
[03:30:19] <NeilRG> for me
[03:30:24] <MrElendig> why not?
[03:30:28] <matsaman> it's reasonable for a lot of people
[03:30:34] <NeilRG> for one, poetry activates the venv automatically when I enter the directory
[03:30:34] <matsaman> but it's okay if you can't stomach the idea =)
[03:30:42] <MrElendig> you can tell it not to

[03:31:36] <MrElendig> not activating doesn't make it any harder to keep them seperate
[03:31:49] <iDunno> I write bad poetry aka pooetry
[03:31:54] <matsaman> hurrr
[03:33:00] <MrElendig> another solution is of course neovim since it uses a rpc instead of embedding python itself, so it avoids  the problem that way

[05:07:48] <sozuba> kline, I have so far checked void, calculate, crux, gobo and nix. By checked i mean read,, not use. Gentoo is the only one i used.
[05:08:03] <kline> but they are just examples of how different distros have different mechanisms
[05:08:16] <kline> just because something doesnt have USE flags doesnt mean you cant get the same result
[05:08:18] <sozuba> kline ah okay.
[05:08:32] <craigevil> sozuba, not sure, definitely works on Debian
[05:08:36] <kline> so look for how the package manager works for this use case, rather than specifically for flags
[05:08:51] <n4dir> void has the "advantage" of also having the option to install binary packages. I'd even say it is rather the usual way
[05:09:02] <kline> (otherwise a debian user would have excluded gentoo for not having pinning, not realising they wanted flags instead!!)

[05:09:33] <sozuba> kline, "just because something doesnt have USE flags doesnt mean you cant get the same result", that's what i wanted to know. Guess i'll do a advised, find a distro i like and check how to bend it to what i want.

[05:09:58] <n4dir> sozuba: so you got any specific packages in mind? or is this just a theoretical question?
[05:10:31] <sozuba> kline , true
[05:11:19] <kline> im also interested in what it is you want to ban
[05:11:39] <sozuba> n4dir, systemd and any gnome and kde libraries/dependencies, etc. Also I am thinking about going purely free (as in fsf definition) for example ;)
[05:11:54] <sozuba> kline, ^^
[05:11:57] <kline> you might consider devuan
[05:12:06] <kline> which is systemd-less debian
[05:12:18] *** Joins: Jimmy_H_ (~Jimmy_H@119.136.152.253)
[05:12:20] <n4dir> purely free and systemd free and from source would be dragora, but it is anything close to ready, last time i checked. Also hardly any users
[05:12:33] <sozuba> kline, yes i tried devuan, like it better than debian (not here to flame, just my opinion), but it isn't sourcce based. May be its my ocd
[05:12:35] <n4dir> void is also systemdfree, but you probably know already
[05:12:48] <kline> unfortunately the linux community has pretty much decided that systemd is the way forward so you might have some issue as we continue into the future and your room to work becomes smaller and smaller without systemd
[05:12:58] <kline> nah, its ok
[05:13:01] <[[R]]> kline: becaues ssytemd is the cats whiskers... duh
[05:13:01] <kline> everyone has their preferences
[05:13:04] <n4dir> after debian introduece systemd, i used void for quite a while, and it sure was a pleasure
[05:13:27] <kline> sozuba, what is it you dont like about gentoo?
[05:13:34] <kline> since that appears to be the obvious answer
[05:13:53] <sozuba> n4dir, just checked dragora website sometime ago, infact looked at all free dists that are systemd free, like hyperbola etc.
[05:14:23] <n4dir> i sure am not in arch-based at all, but hyperbola, the guy hangs out in #dragora, it seems to do the job

[05:17:07] <sozuba> kline, I am aware of this "you might have some issue as we continue into the future and your room to work becomes smaller and smaller without systemd", and even looked in to all the flavours of bsd. For now i wish to settle with some linux that has some kind of a good philosophical ideology to freedom. May be if time permist i might move to BSD.
[05:17:08] <sozuba> Well, this is a constant debate within myself, I know i sound very paranoid, and I am. But that'e because i don't take authority well, despite not have much against systemd other than few simple arguments against. Its more philosophical for me.

[05:19:23] <n4dir> well, after a long journey i moved back to debian-based, but i lost pretty much all interest in computing anyway, and debian-based is pretty comfortable for me

But unfortunately, there are certain questions i need answers for due to the recent changes, though i have read¬† through their reasons and do agree on it. SO again, its more of philosophical at
[05:20:49] <sozuba> this point. I do plant to ask gentoo users some clarity regarding this. But I am also looking at options that's my reason for the question here.
[05:20:57] <n4dir> i'd go for void, or if you really got a strong urge for free hyperbola, or perhaps BSD, as you said.

[07:17:40] <ficonni> does anyone else suddenly have slow debian mirrors ? They worked just fine and I would have several MB/s but now it's just 200 kb/s and it's annoying af.

[09:15:13] <jim> in fact they both have, an hdmi, 4 usbs, and an ethernet

[09:17:03] <Shortstop> I don't know about the Raspberry Pi Zero
[09:17:18] <Shortstop> but any normal Pi from the 3B+ onward, like the RPi4, etc, has HDMI out
[09:17:48] <Shortstop> sixs: yeah they DO have multiple USBs but I would personally recommend to only use ONE single external HDD on it personally
[09:18:04] <Shortstop> if you use more than 1, you run the risk of the other one not getting enough power since its a small device
[09:18:25] <sixs> Shortstop: microHdmi to Hdmi cable needed right ?
[09:18:28] <jim> yes... so you can have a usb keyboard and mouse, a usb storage device of some kind, and a connection to an ethernet hub somewhere
[09:18:33] <Shortstop> I ruined an HDD not knowing this, and to this day, the thing is messed up though I debate seeing if I could save the drive somehow. I remember it would make a weird noise too.

[16:47:11] <Psi-Jack> That seems like a bad idea.
[16:47:12] <PaulFertser> Professional translators use such tools which greatly simplify the job.
[16:47:24] <iliv> anyone familiar with badblocks? the man page says that the -w flag is going to cause badblocks to "[scan] for bad blocks by writing some patterns (0xaa, 0x55, 0xff, 0x00) on every block of the device, reading every block and comparing the contents." I'm past the 0xaa write test and it's now reading and comparing. I started wondering what it's going to do next? Is it going to do another write test by writing 0x55 patter and then follow up by reading and comparing
[16:47:24] <iliv>  and then do the same for 0xff and 0x00? Is that going to be a total of 8 write and read/compare tests?
[16:47:27] <PaulFertser> They find and show already translated similar phrases automatically.
[16:47:34] <Psi-Jack> PaulFertser: I know many professional translators. And no, they don't.

[19:16:07] <tirnanog> shan: one is that the rule at line #5 doesn't match on the NEW state (which is something that makes sense to do in a stateful ruleset). by constrast, #8 - #11 do. moreover, it won't actually work. you jump to the f2b-sshd chain, which simply returns, with processing continuing in the INPUT chain.

[19:17:12] <shan> tirnanog: i'm not actually sure where the f2b rules came from. I don't remember setting them up
[19:17:15] <tirnanog> shan: the second obvious anomaly is that none of the rules in the OUTPUT chain are useful. that's because your OUTPUT chain policy is set to ACCEPT and there are no filtering rules. so, the OUTPUT chain would work just as well if it contained no rules.

[22:22:10] <s33ker> can someone explian for example apt-get install -y¬†¬†¬†¬† ?
[22:22:11] <hodapp> Utrecht did the study about how cats are happier when they have cardboard boxes to be inside of
[22:22:19] <MrElendig> s33ker: man apt-get ?
[22:22:25] <luna> o:
[22:22:39] <s33ker> MrElendig thx let me see
[22:23:04] <MrElendig> -y, --yes, --assume-yes; Automatic yes to prompts. Assume "yes" as answer to all prompts and run non-interactively. If an undesirable situation, such as changing a held package or removing an essential package, occurs then apt-get will abort.
[22:23:09] <MrElendig> generally not something you should use
[22:23:26] *** Quits: han-solo (~hanish@user/han-solo) (Quit: leaving)
[22:23:36] <MrElendig> because what apt-get thinks is an undesirable situation and what you think is one may differ a lot
[22:23:39] <s33ker> find it now i need to save this command...thx a lot
[22:23:50] <s33ker> i thught it was yes to all or something
