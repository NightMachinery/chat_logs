[09:53:55] <GodEater> we're also still dealing with logisitical issues. As of this morning, it looks like we might actually be able to make it into Queensland (and therefore Brisbane), but yesterday that wasn't possible, and so we have all these contingency plans

[09:54:33] <bagder> that does indeed sound tough

[19:39:38] <bch> hello #curl 
[19:42:34] <bch> so -- curl is coded in C99 because there are constraints in the world that limit what compilers one can depend on. I wonder if anybody can list some of those (bonus points for something surprising -- somethings thats super-common w/ that limit). Are the "limiting" platforms just resource constrained embedded systems or old OSes that aren't receiving updates, ...?

[20:13:28] <bch> anyway, still interested in the systems that keep c89/c90 the standard -- I'm not for discussing the standart, just getting familiar w/ some of the names of the systems
[20:13:34] <bch> *standard
[20:13:50] <Piru> resource constraints aren't that different in c89 vs c99. I would guess it's more about compiler availability in some niche platforms
[20:14:25] <bch> thats what I understand. In this case I consider the compiler a resource :)
[20:14:33] <Piru> right
[20:16:28] <bch> My motivation is seeing another project considering bumping its compiler, and I'm curious if there's anything enlightening I can learn w/ the cut-off that curl makes... 
[20:24:40] <Piru> curl supports some really obscure or old OSes. minix, vms and netware come to mind, but there are other rather obscure ones, too
