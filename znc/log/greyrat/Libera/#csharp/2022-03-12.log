[00:46:25] <maroon> is there a way in c# to do the equivalent of #include filename.h? i have some huge arrays with defined elements that i'm trying to move to a separate filename to keep the main.cs at a normal filesize
[00:47:13] <DoofusCanadensis> write a .cs and uses it
[00:47:44] <DoofusCanadensis> oh nm me... you're thinking include header
[00:49:18] <irwiss> there isn't one, you only need to do anything if they're in separate assemblies(projects), if they're in the same assembly just use the array directly
[00:49:40] <maroon> all that would be in the other file would be several ' uint arrayname = new byte[nnnnn] { long,list,of,initialized,values };
[00:49:58] <night_wulfe> If you want to put them in a separate file, you will have to wrap them in a class
[00:50:02] <maroon> but the problem is that having the array be in main.cs makes the .cs be nearly 7 megs
[00:50:21] <night_wulfe> I believe you can use a partial class if you want them to appear as members of an existing class in main.cs

[01:17:56] <lz_> top notch

[01:18:43] <lz_> I'm sure there are others
[01:18:59] <Lukky> does "best in class" sound good?
[01:19:17] <JakeSays> i've also seen it as best in breed, but not sure if that's grammatically correct
[01:19:25] <lz_> maybe; english isn't my mother tongue either so can't promise
[01:19:29] <Lukky> ahhh... best in breed, yes...

[01:20:57] <Lukky> I am ;-)
[01:21:07] <JakeSays> proof i said.. proof.
[01:21:31] <Lukky> It's so niche, that there is a handful of people on the planet offering this service actually

[01:21:43] <teegee> I'll write you one for 100 bucks
[01:21:46] <JakeSays> because seriously when i see that phrase i almost always question it
[01:22:27] <Lukky> yes, that's true... how would you say it, knowing that it's true, but without sounding like I'm bullshiting?
[01:23:01] <Lukky> "one of the best"?

[02:19:02] <jonp> Beam: what do you mean "unwrap"?
[02:21:15] <alguien> Beam, i think you can just pass the array as long as the type matches
[02:22:56] <Beam> i'll try
[02:23:07] <Beam> jonp: i mean i have all the arguments in an object array
[02:23:57] <jonp> Beam: `string.Format ("{0} {1}", new object[]{ "hello", "world!"});` returns "hello world!"
[02:24:02] <jonp> which i imagine is what you want?

[02:24:58] <alguien> Beam, mind you though, type has to match otherwise I think it'll mistake say an int[] for an object (rather than an object[])
[02:25:01] <jonp> now, early preview beta versions of C# back in 1999 handled that wrong.  But unless you're dealing with a pre-.NET Framework 1.0 C# compiler, that shouldn't be a concern.

[02:55:05] <brianonymous> Vic20 at first.. actually i missed one.. i learned gwbasic after commodore basic
[02:55:13] <JakeSays> we had a few PETs in our computer lab in high school. they were pretty cool
[02:55:18] <Lukky> I had a Vic-20 too :-)
[02:55:22] <brianonymous> turbo pascal fuckin rocked.. and my uncle worked at Borland.. sooo
[02:55:28] <JakeSays> alguien: turbo pascal was the bomb
[02:56:07] <JakeSays> i also used UCSD pascal on an apple 2 and turbo pascal/mac
[02:56:18] <JakeSays> along with turbo pascal/pc
[02:56:57] <Lukky> those were the days...
[02:57:00] <JakeSays> pascal was big in the 70's/80's.
[02:57:03] <brianonymous> sure was
[02:57:05] <JakeSays> Lukky: indeed they were!

[02:57:09] <alguien> and what were your first two real jobs?
[02:57:12] <JakeSays> nothing but opportunity
[02:57:15] <alguien> programming jobs*
[02:57:30] <brianonymous> i wish i was a littttle bit older back then
[02:57:38] <brianonymous> when the puters came i mean
[02:57:40] <Lukky> 2400 baud modems connecting to BBSes...
[02:58:31] <Lukky> The hardware kinda sucked in some cases, but the fun of being some kind of pioneer... none of my friends ever owned computers in those days...
[02:58:42] <JakeSays> alguien: i did a ton of consulting in the 80's, but iirc my first one paying one was a disk copy library for a northstar, z80 assy
[02:58:54] <brianonymous> real jobs? i worked at the naval academy in the tv studio.. after that i weasled my way through the support position of a credit reporting company into dev
[02:59:00] <JakeSays> brianonymous: yeah i wish i were 10-15 years older

[03:00:56] <Lukky> Oh god yes, Apple II's
[03:01:04] <Lukky> JakeSays: ahh micros.. yes
[03:01:31] <Lukky> And there was a Coleco thing also...
[03:01:39] <JakeSays> there was so much money to be made back then
[03:02:12] <JakeSays> easy money
[03:02:33] <brianonymous> thats why i wish i was older during the revolution
[03:02:38] <JakeSays> yup
[03:02:49] <Lukky> right... look at how Gates made a fortune with some "borrowed" piece of cr*p code
[03:03:04] <alguien> Lukky, try writing that yourself though
[03:03:12] <Lukky> he didn't
[03:03:14] <alguien> it's ever easier to create programs
[03:03:21] <alguien> Lukky, heh
[03:03:33] <alguien> he did write real code though iirc
[03:03:41] <JakeSays> he did, in the very beginning
[03:03:50] <Lukky> Tim Paterson wrote DOS
[03:03:50] <JakeSays> he wrote the original ms basic
[03:04:08] <Lukky> oh, yeah, maybe
[03:04:19] <Lukky> he still was a wiz for sure

[03:17:51] <JakeSays> i dont think we'll ever know how good of an engineer gates was because he shifted in to business mode way early

[03:18:01] <brianonymous> i still point to basic
[03:18:03] <JakeSays> the source is available
[03:18:37] <Lukky> that had to be challenging :-)
[03:19:04] <JakeSays> i used to love coding in assembly
[03:19:10] <Lukky> MASM !!!
[03:19:13] <brianonymous> its fun for some things
[03:19:15] <JakeSays> lol yup
[03:19:42] <Lukky> I learned that in college... writing serial drivers
[03:19:49] <brianonymous> other times i would just want to get a basic function done and not type in 400 lines of code
[03:20:02] <brianonymous> mixed mode was best
[03:20:11] <Lukky> brianonymous: which basic was that?
[03:20:22] <brianonymous> oh i mean a basic function in asm
[03:20:25] <brianonymous> my bad
[03:20:26] <Lukky> ohh
[03:20:28] <Lukky> lol
[03:20:37] <JakeSays> my first basic was trs-dos basic
[03:20:49] <brianonymous> like, you take something like printf for granted until you try to implement it in pure asm
[03:21:21] <Lukky> with all the possible parameters!!
[03:21:26] <JakeSays> i did a lot of 68k assembly as well
[03:21:30] <brianonymous> yeah.. ive done it -once-
[03:21:35] <brianonymous> that was enough.
[03:21:42] <JakeSays> brianonymous: done what once?
[03:21:49] <brianonymous> i think i still even have it.. a printf in pure asm
[03:21:56] <JakeSays> ah
[03:22:18] <Lukky> JakeSays: 6809 was pure fun! Then 68k in school, but it was not as fun as that good old 6809
[03:22:40] <JakeSays> i never did any 6809

[03:53:20] <brianonymous> its clear i have no idea how typescript works
[03:53:43] <alguien> I like how MS says typescript types would just be discarded. As if. We had asm.js because js would benefit from types. The browser that discards types loses. If JS gets types, it's going to be an (optionally) typed language from then on I reckon

[04:32:51] <bpmedley_> irwiss : Have you tried CSS grid lately?
[04:33:37] <bpmedley_> The reason I ask, is because I feel like CSS grid is a comfortable middle-ground between tables and pixel perfect css.  Perhaps, almost easier than tables.
[04:33:54] <bpmedley_> Definitely easier than pixel perfect css.
[04:38:34] <irwiss> flex and grid are sorta ok, but not usable unless you can drop support for legacy browsers
[04:38:53] <irwiss> and even then, tables are still simpler than both
[04:38:55] <bpmedley_> You must support browsers that do not support grid?

[10:14:24] <_genuser_> nvidia went with disabling aero and showing that monitor with only a mobile resolution.
[10:14:38] <_genuser_> then after tinkering it allowed custom resolution in driver. and after waking up the monitor stays fine.
[10:14:53] <_genuser_> but this one time, it just disabled that whole monitor. and the computer thinks only one monitor is plugged in.
[10:15:03] <_genuser_> restart the monitor and it says there are two.

[14:08:40] <MatthiasVance> Nasp is dead lettered
[14:12:34] <sysRPN> my first complete freecad modeling exercise -> https://cache.getlazarus.org/freecad/bracket.jpg
[14:13:52] <MatthiasVance> Nice sysRPN !
[14:13:57] <MatthiasVance> Have you tried OpenSCAD btw?
[14:14:04] <sysRPN> yes. a lot
[14:14:10] <MatthiasVance> Nice!
[14:14:20] <sysRPN> here is something i learned
[14:14:21] <MatthiasVance> Is FreeCAD similar or just modeling?
[14:14:40] <sysRPN> freecad is a mutant piece of software
[14:14:55] <sysRPN> it integrates a bunch of stuff ... poorly
[14:15:12] <sysRPN> for example, freecad integrates openscad
[14:15:52] <sysRPN> that is, there is a openscad view and editor inside of freecad, but it's worse in everyway when compared to the standalone openscad program
[14:16:38] <sysRPN> freecad also integrates a web browser, a spreadsheet, a word processor
[14:16:42] <sysRPN> it's stupid
[14:17:05] <sysRPN> bt here is the kicker ... freecad is terrible for doing design work
[14:17:54] <sysRPN> because in order to get anything done in frecad, you have to already know what you are making before you make it, otherwise everything falls apart
[14:18:35] <sysRPN> so you need to create your design outside of frecad, then go into freecad and plan to input that design in the correct order
[14:18:44] <sysRPN> or else everything falls apart
[14:19:53] <MatthiasVance> So, why use it? xD
[14:20:31] <sysRPN> i guess to output a mechanical stl file for cnc routing or 3d printing
[14:20:44] <MatthiasVance> OpenSCAD can do that too, right
[14:20:52] <sysRPN> or to share a design with someone else in digitial form
[14:21:14] <MatthiasVance> I used OpenSCAD -> Export STL -> Import in slicer -> Send to 3D printer
[14:21:51] <sysRPN> yeah but i've used openscad a lot. while i like openscad, it's totally not suitable for inputting 3d mechanical designs

[14:22:51] <Nasp> Whenever i try autocad i just so easily get stuck
[14:23:03] <sysRPN> because all openscad offers you is basic primitives ... that is sphere, box, or cylinder
[14:23:28] <sysRPN> Nasp: are you using autocad for 2D design and getting stuck?
[14:24:14] <Nasp> 3d
[14:24:29] <sysRPN> yeah well, autocad isn't really made for 3d work

[14:25:37] <Nasp> isn't it made exactly for 3D design as well
[14:25:58] <Nasp> It just seems like all the tools are hard to use for basic stuff
[14:26:04] <Nasp> But could just be me who's not very good at modelling

[14:51:39] <JakeSays> you basically made my point.
[14:51:40] <sysRPN> i didn't say i can't, i said it is incredibly tedious
[14:51:51] <JakeSays> no, you said it was impossible.

[19:52:06] <dan01> Hey guys
[19:52:11] <xb0o2> Hello
[19:52:16] <dan01> I've read C# uses UTF-16 for strings
[19:52:18] <dan01> that true?
[19:52:30] <dan01> Like if  you write a string literal in a .cs file
[19:52:36] <dan01> Hope I'm getting this right
[19:52:52] <xb0o2> C# strings are UTF-16, yes
[19:52:59] <dan01> So but like
[19:53:06] <dan01> When I write C# code in VS Code
[19:53:09] <dan01> Using UTF-8
[19:53:14] <dan01> How does that work?
[19:53:38] <JakeSays> strings are utf-16, but c# source code is utf-8 iirc
[19:54:01] <dan01> Yes, but like if I write in a CS file, using VS Code, UTF-8: var myStr =
[19:54:09] <dan01> var myStr = "some string"
[19:54:17] <dan01> so that's UTF-8, right?
[19:54:19] *** Joins: Fiji (~Fiji@user/fiji)
[19:54:21] <bomb> in Soviet C#, strings are ISO-8859-1
[19:54:33] <JakeSays> the compiler compiles it to a utf-16 character array
[19:54:35] <xb0o2> The file on disk may well be UTF-8.
[19:54:36] <dan01> and then I guess csc compiles it and encodes it in URF-16?
[19:54:39] <xb0o2> The string in memory is UTF-16.
[19:54:41] <dan01> ok
[19:54:45] <dan01> makes sense, ok
[19:54:48] <dan01> Now question
[19:55:06] *** Joins: SGautam (uid286066@id-286066.ilkley.irccloud.com)
[19:55:06] <dan01> UTF-16 is variable length, not fixed
[19:55:08] <dan01> right?
[19:55:13] <JakeSays> correct
[19:55:43] <dan01> So how the fuck is C# so smart as to be able to use integer indexes like myStr[5:7]
[19:55:51] <dan01> Or you can't do that in C#
[19:55:52] <dan01> ?
[19:55:56] <dan01> Am I confusing things?
[19:55:57] <JakeSays> you can do that
[19:56:02] <dan01> ah, good
[19:56:10] <dan01> so that's super cool
[19:56:34] <dan01> So how is it able to differenciate between bytes and chars?
[19:56:42] <dan01> Cause Stupid Apple Swift can't do that
[19:56:57] <JakeSays> dan01: they're two different types
[19:58:03] <JakeSays> dan01: foo[5:7] isn't the bytes 5,6,7 - it's the characters
[19:58:12] <dan01> True
[19:58:14] <JakeSays> which could be 6 bytes minimum
[19:58:19] <dan01> So Chars abstract bytes
[19:58:29] <JakeSays> abstract?
[19:58:34] <xb0o2> `char`s are 16 bit values
[19:58:47] <dan01> as in a Char can hold a number of bytes
[19:59:00] <dan01> But you don't care about that it's an abstraction
[19:59:02] <JakeSays> it is two bytes wide, but that's not too relevant
[19:59:11] <dan01> But see
[19:59:12] <JakeSays> it's not an abstraction
[19:59:20] <dan01> UTF-16 can be two or four bytes
[19:59:20] <JakeSays> chars and bytes aren't related
[19:59:33] <bomb> I like licking 12V batteries
[19:59:43] <dan01> bomb: Ok...
[19:59:44] <JakeSays> dan01: actually utf-16 can be 1 or 2 characters
[20:00:06] <dan01> JakeSays: chars and bytes aren't related...
[20:00:08] <dan01> Well
[20:00:12] <dan01> That confuses me
[20:00:20] <JakeSays> the're different types
[20:00:32] <xb0o2> dan01: Treating a `string` as a collection of `chars` does not perform any magic.
[20:00:40] <xb0o2> It's no different to Swift in that regard.
[20:00:46] <dan01> But it is
[20:00:56] <dan01> Swift can't do myString[1:6]
[20:01:01] <dan01> because Apple is retard
[20:01:44] <dan01> Look my point is
[20:01:51] <dan01> A string is a collection of chars
[20:02:03] <JakeSays> i'm not actually sure exactly what foo[1:6] would return if there were surrogate pairs in there, but my guess is it'd do the right thing
[20:02:27] <dan01> but because of UTF-8 or URF-16 regardless, Chars are varible size, right?
[20:02:28] <JakeSays> Suchiman: you'd know the answer to this

[20:03:22] <dan01> So why does that display what it does?
[20:03:23] <bomb> beautiful
[20:03:38] <xb0o2> Because indexing a `string` returns a `char`.
[20:03:50] <dan01> Well, how can Chars be fixed 16 bits, since a UTF-16 char can be...
[20:03:52] <dan01> oh wait
[20:04:00] <dan01> it can be maximal 16 bits?
[20:04:10] <bomb> shocker
[20:04:16] <dan01> oh God
[20:04:16] <xb0o2> Stop saying char repeatedly
[20:04:18] <dan01> I'm so dumb
[20:04:19] <dan01> ok
[20:04:30] <xb0o2> A C# `char` is a 16 bit integer.
[20:04:31] <dan01> ok
[20:04:49] <xb0o2> UTF-16 works with 16 bit code units.
[20:05:03] <xb0o2> Some Unicode code points require 2 16 bit code units to represent (like the one I just linked).
[20:05:16] <dan01> So then, it's just that C# may use more space that needed for things like simple letters, right? like a,b,c that don't require a whole 16bit?
[20:05:39] <xb0o2> C# `char`s are *always* 16 bits.
[20:05:41] <xb0o2> It's a 16 bit type.
[20:05:48] <dan01> Yes I got that
[20:05:52] <dan01> But I'm saying
[20:06:24] <Suchiman> dan01: yes, storing ascii in utf16 has 50% overhead
[20:06:24] <dan01> Something like "A" doesn't actually require all of those 16 bits, does it? It's only more complicated things like Unicode specific that do?
[20:06:32] <dan01> Suchiman: yes, thanks
[20:06:36] <xb0o2> Correct.
[20:06:50] <xb0o2> 'a' as a C# char would be...
[20:06:59] <Suchiman> dan01: and if you use utf32 then it has 3 byte overhead xD
[20:07:05] <xb0o2> 0000000001100001
[20:07:06] <dan01> But let's take for example that specific Unicode that you just showed xb0o2
[20:07:12] <dan01> "§≠¢";
[20:07:30] <dan01> So that requires 2 16bit  entries?
[20:07:33] <JakeSays> Suchiman: does c# support utf-32?
[20:07:35] <xb0o2> Correct
[20:08:12] <Suchiman> JakeSays: there's utf32 encoding class but string is always utf16
[20:08:21] <dan01> But I thought UTF-16 can encode all Unicode in maximal 16bits
[20:08:24] <Nasp> JakeSays: k Instead of just "lol you owe 1000 dollars"
[20:08:28] <JakeSays> that's what i thought
[20:08:29] <xb0o2> No, dan01.
[20:08:32] <dan01> Ah ok
[20:08:33] <Nasp> Then seeing the actual calculations behind it
[20:08:35] <xb0o2> Hence why it's variable length.
[20:08:42] <dan01> Then that's the thing I got wrong
[20:09:00] <xb0o2> Everything it can represent in a single 16 bit code unit it will, everything higher will use 2 16 bit code units.
[20:09:05] <Nasp> JakeSays:  and no you dont have to calculate anything yourself
[20:09:14] <dan01> Ok, so then s[0] prints gibrish because...
[20:09:24] <JakeSays> Nasp: i dont understand. here all the math is publicly available
[20:09:29] <xb0o2> Because it's not a printable code unit by itself.
[20:09:42] <JakeSays> along with the thousands of pages that describe it
[20:09:48] <dan01> Ok
[20:10:12] <dan01> So any idea why Swift doesn't support s[2:5]
[20:10:19] <dan01> But uses String.Index instead/
[20:10:26] <dan01> Why would you do that?
[20:10:36] <JakeSays> dan01: design choice i suppose
[20:10:36] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: You mean you just want to see it at a glance right
[20:10:55] <dan01> JakeSays: Yes, but why? What's the advantage or reason?
[20:11:00] <dan01> It just makes things hard
[20:11:13] <JakeSays> dan01: i don't know. i've never even looked at swift
[20:11:15] <xb0o2> dan01: a lot of different languages make different choices for strings because once you involve Unicode it's not actually straight forward.
[20:11:32] <xb0o2> When you slice a string like that, what do you want? bytes? code units? code points?
[20:11:57] <canton7> Yeah, you've already established that some codepoints can take 2 utf-16 words... But plenty of "characters" take more than 1 codepoint to represent
[20:11:57] <dan01> code points
[20:12:17] <xb0o2> That's fine for you but a lot of other people would want to deal with bytes.
[20:12:20] <dan01> Oh yeah, right
[20:12:31] <xb0o2> e.g. if you're mainly concerned with shunting bytes down a wire.
[20:12:33] <dan01> Because of Unicode normalization
[20:12:39] <canton7> e.g. √Ñ can either be represented as a single '√Ñ' codepoint, or an 'A' codepoint followed by a ¬® codepoint
[20:12:49] <dan01> canton7: yes, I see
[20:13:05] <dan01> Well I want, I bet 90% of people do is charcatchers
[20:13:10] <dan01> Like actually printable things
[20:13:17] <dan01> Like I don
[20:13:18] <canton7> So those are your graphemes. But then move up a level into extended grapheme clusters, which are what humans see as single printable characters.
[20:13:25] <dan01> don't care about code points or bytes or whatever
[20:13:55] <canton7> e.g. 'üë©üèæ‚Äçüöí' is a single EGC, but it's 4 separate codepoints
[20:14:10] <dan01> What's an EGC?
[20:14:15] <canton7> extended grapheme cluster
[20:14:27] <dan01> What's a grapheme?
[20:14:28] <JakeSays> electrical gliding componerator
[20:14:42] <canton7> A grapheme is a sequence of one or more code points that are displayed as a single, graphical unit that a reader recognizes as a single element of the writing system
[20:14:56] <xb0o2> dan01: https://tinyurl.com/bdcsu5de might be useful to look at
[20:15:46] <xb0o2> There's not a clear 'good' default for your slice behaviour
[20:16:29] <xb0o2> canton7's example is another good one - it's 7 `char`s for 1 'text element'
[20:16:56] <canton7> I like üë©üèæ‚Äçüöí, because it's a woman emoji, followed by a skin tone modifier, then a zero-width joiner, and finally a fire engine emoji
[20:17:19] <xb0o2> 3 Unicode codepoints that require 2 UTF-16 code units each, one codepoint that can fit into one code unit
[20:17:24] <JakeSays> canton7: damn. didn't realize things had become that complex
[20:17:37] <canton7> Try pasting üë©üèæ‚Äçüöí into an editor and then hitting backspace. It'll first take off the fire engine leaving üë©üèæ‚Äçüöí, then then reduce it either to üë© or to nothing, depending on how your editor does unicode
[20:17:44] <Nasp> JakeSays: Do you get your taxes back and see the entire calculation for your taxes?
[20:17:52] <canton7> *leaving üë©üèæ
[20:17:55] <Nasp> Or do yu mean "Yes you can find the way to calculate your taxes publicly"
[20:18:05] <JakeSays> Nasp: i have to do the calculations and then send them in
[20:18:14] <dan01> Ok...
[20:18:25] <dan01> Is a grapheme a sound?
[20:18:27] <canton7> ... and while emoji may sound pointless, there are actual scripts which work like this
[20:18:33] <dan01> Like a diacritic?
[20:18:41] <canton7> (but we have more familiarity with emoji than with e.g. Hangul)
[20:19:04] <dan01> So then an EGC is the unicode for the diacritic and then the letter it applies to?
[20:19:26] <Nasp> JakeSays: And IRS just trust you diud the calculations right?
[20:19:49] <Nasp> Here it's opposite, the tax services does the calculations
[20:20:01] <xb0o2> dan01: a grapheme cluster is what is perceived as one 'character' to the user
[20:20:06] <JakeSays> Nasp: they do verification on the returns, but otherwise, yes.
[20:20:25] <Nasp> wow
[20:20:27] <JakeSays> Nasp: we have to calculate all the deductions, etc
[20:20:39] <JakeSays> since the irs doesn't know anything about those
[20:20:43] <Nasp> Anyways i jsut want the proof behind the returns
[20:20:49] <canton7> A grapheme is what a human would think of as a single visible character.
[20:20:56] <Nasp> IRs here knows about all the deductions
[20:21:09] <JakeSays> Nasp: how can they?
[20:21:14] <canton7> (which might be one or more codepoints)

[21:43:18] <Suchiman> CoderGuy: int is a struct so it will be passed by value, meaning the method receives a copy of that value, any change you do to myint will not propagate to the caller nor is it possible for the caller to somehow modify myint during the execution of dosomething

[21:45:19] <CoderGuy> I wanted to know like "should I always check if it's an array or not" but given the logic I don't have to
[21:46:26] <CoderGuy> idk why but in the back of my mind I always thought "well what if something happens I didn't intend to happen" maybe it's just my coder/tester brain
[21:47:17] <Suchiman> CoderGuy: for reference types like classes you define or arrays, those live on the heap, the reference itself will be passed by value, meaning when you have `Method(string[] a)` and do `a = new string[12];` then neither the object on the heap nor the reference the calling method used are being modified. If you do a[0] = "Test"; then that will be visible to the caller and the caller or another thread could also concurrently make modifications
[21:47:17] <Suchiman> to the contents of the array but not the array itself
[21:48:10] <CoderGuy> icic, yeah i'm doing something way more simple which is "check if it's a string, if it is split it, if it's not we have an array" and I wanted to know "do we have an array, could it still be a string somehow?"
[21:48:35] <CoderGuy> but considering nothing else can alter it, this should be fine to assume logic
[21:48:41] <Suchiman> CoderGuy: sounds like something that would be better handled by method overloading than dynamic type checks?
[21:48:56] <CoderGuy> hows that work? cuz I have "are you a string, k lets split you"
[21:49:16] <CoderGuy> do you mean multiple methods?
[21:49:35] <Suchiman> `MyMethod(string s) { //split it }` and `MyMethod(string[] a) { // whatever }`

[21:49:41] <CoderGuy> you're right
[21:49:42] <CoderGuy> probably
[21:49:49] <Suchiman> overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different argument types

[22:45:55] <cloudbender> very nice

[22:50:45] <Suchiman> cloudbender: awesome :P
[22:50:57] <MatthiasVance> All those wasted lines though, yuck
[22:51:42] <DoofusCanadensis> is that stripping the padding dashes from the end of the hash?
[22:52:20] <cloudbender> .. and the embedded dashes
[22:52:26] <DoofusCanadensis> embedded?
[22:52:36] <DoofusCanadensis> okay weird
[22:53:28] <DoofusCanadensis> cool function tho
[22:57:50] <cloudbender> here is what the cashes return as, with no stripping
[22:57:52] <cloudbender> 6D-F5-1E-EE-CB-21-D0-E4-65-D8-3A-78-FC-EF-60-8E
[22:57:59] <cloudbender> ... hashes
[22:58:40] <cloudbender> I don't care what I get, as long as two files have an identical hash image
[22:58:43] <DoofusCanadensis> oh, okay. yeah, that's a pretty dumb return
[23:01:23] <MatthiasVance> cloudbender: Don't use BitConverter.ToString() then?
[23:01:38] <MatthiasVance> Because telling it to do that and then undoing half of it is stupid
[23:03:57] <dan01[m]> guys
[23:04:01] <DoofusCanadensis> oh that's the BitConverter doing that? why aren't we parsing the MD5 stream itself?
[23:04:09] <MatthiasVance> let md5sum filename = filename |> File.OpenRead |> MD5.Create().ComputeHash |> BitConverter.ToString
[23:04:15] <MatthiasVance> Still like F# one better :D
[23:04:17] <dan01[m]> Is Unicode retarded?
[23:04:56] <DoofusCanadensis> heh
[23:05:43] <cloudbender> ComputeHash returns byte[], I'd rather return a string
[23:05:54] <MatthiasVance> cloudbender: Yes but you don't need BitConverter for that...

[23:07:43] <DoofusCanadensis> what does MD5.ToString() return?
[23:08:23] <DoofusCanadensis> oic... that's for the MD5 object. nm me
[23:09:48] <cloudbender> it return '¬†¬† System.Byte[]¬†¬†¬† '
[23:10:28] <cloudbender> And the compute is a streaming compute ...
[23:10:34] <cloudbender> so ...
[23:11:10] <xb0o2> dan01[m]: no, it's not ;)
[23:11:36] <DoofusCanadensis> string utfString = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytes, 0, bytes.Length);
[23:11:46] <DoofusCanadensis> string representation of a byte array
[23:11:50] <DoofusCanadensis> no dashes
[23:12:02] <MatthiasVance> Well that doesn't do the same :D
[23:13:19] <DoofusCanadensis> hmm, now I'm curious

[23:14:22] <MatthiasVance> Oh wait sorry
[23:14:26] <xb0o2> My question is...
[23:14:44] <xb0o2> If the code in question was using MD5 to hash the file to detect changes...
[23:15:00] <xb0o2> Why are we ever even dealing with strings?
[23:15:08] <MatthiasVance> ^
[23:15:13] <DoofusCanadensis> probably to write it to a database somewhere
[23:15:19] <xb0o2> ... write the bytes.
[23:15:20] <DoofusCanadensis> inefficient, yes
[23:15:29] <xb0o2> Oh my, it almost rhymes
[23:15:35] <xb0o2> Byte is right! Byte is right!
[23:15:46] <DoofusCanadensis> but so few people understand binary data in databases
[23:16:03] <xb0o2> Binary data isn't for people to understand
[23:16:20] <cloudbender> I do fine with binary data
[23:16:33] <cloudbender> I don't want to parse binary data
[23:16:41] <cloudbender> I want to be lazy and¬† use a haser
[23:16:54] <DoofusCanadensis> what's there to parse? you're just comparing a hash... in binary
[23:17:00] <cloudbender> to get a reasoably sane signature I can compare against
[23:17:08] <MatthiasVance> You can compare 2 byte arrays..
[23:17:16] <xb0o2> Just compare the MD5 bytes
[23:17:27] <xb0o2> Then there's never any question of which string representation you use for those bytes
[23:17:33] <xb0o2> Of which there are many
[23:17:41] <xb0o2> And are all irrelevant to what you're actually doing
[23:17:54] <lz_> if you convert it to a string, then you can convert it into any language for eg japanese
[23:18:58] <irwiss> md5 hash is the same in japanese as it is in english tho, unless you write out the numbers as 15 -> 'fifteen'

[23:44:46] <merced> i love unicode
[23:44:53] <merced> the ring to rule them all
[23:45:01] <xb0o2> Realistically it was always going to be required to ease the transition from those competing encodings
[23:45:43] <merced> also imagine the annoyance if every single language with a non-ascii charset, had an entirely different encoding
[23:45:57] <xb0o2> And to be honest, it's not really any different than saying 3 + 7 is the same as 8 + 2 so that's 'not cool'

[23:56:34] <xb0o2> There has been a lot of progress towards reducing nesting
