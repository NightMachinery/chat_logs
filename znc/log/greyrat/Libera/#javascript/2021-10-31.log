[02:26:20] <FlorianBad> if I a listener:   `e.addEventListener('click', function(t,b,v){ ... }.bind(null,t,b), true);` Is there a way for it to keep t and b somehow for when I call .click() on the element? (if I don't have them when I call it)
[02:27:14] <FlorianBad> because right now I have the impression that when if the element is actually clicked it's fine but if I call click() on it, some thing are missing

[02:50:34] <hassoon> FlorianBad: when you call .click() the console.log is printed in the console, what's wrong ?
[02:50:50] <FlorianBad> hassoon: nothing is wrong, and that's what's wrong ;)
[02:51:06] <FlorianBad> because that probably isn't the cause of my problem
[02:51:07] <hassoon> FlorianBad: i don't get it, what do you want to achieve ?
[02:51:37] <FlorianBad> I'm debugging a code of mine that seems to lose some of the parameters. So I thought calling click() was the problem, but it isn't ;)
[02:52:08] <hassoon> ah ok, your parameters are fine anyway
[02:53:18] <hassoon> never needed to chain .bind to my event handlers though, haven't seen .bind in years in vanilla javascript
[02:53:26] <hassoon> it's always around in e.g react though

[07:54:46] <ljharb> the reason `Object.assign` does that is because it's not useful to throw on non-objects (since most language APIs ToObject anything they get that needs to be treated like an object), and throwing on null/undefined wouldn't have served any purpose.

[10:35:45] <xochilpili> i have something like this: constructor(@inject(MY_TYPES.MySymbol) @tagged('sample','first') private sample: ISample, @inject(MY_TYPES.MySymbol) @tagged('sample', 'second') private secondSample: ISample)
[10:36:24] *** Joins: gitesh (uid423739@id-423739.ilkley.irccloud.com)
[10:37:21] <xochilpili> which works, but when im trying to mock, i need different mocks for each, so: container.rebind(MY_TYPES.MySymbol).toConstantValue(myMockForFirst); and then the same but for the second one, is this possible ?

[18:54:53] <zsoc> Is there any reasonable way to indent a chaining API that isn't hideous to look at? pardon the somewhat pseudo code: https://gist.github.com/jkantr/b89b7a2f126f209595967ab90f8de9ee
[18:55:11] <zsoc> the last option is probably the most visually obvious but also there's ... an extra set of grouping operators, which seems like more cruft
[18:57:07] <zsoc> basically anytime there is any keyword in front of the opening expression of the chaining api, the chains then won't line up below (because they are lining up with the keyword instead)

[19:03:03] <zsoc> Actually... in the last example, i'm wondering if there are edge cases where it means something different... semantically. I don't think there are but I could be wrong.
[19:03:27] <zsoc> It's just vastly more readable (awaiting a grouping, having that grouping be entirely on its own indentation level)
[19:03:50] <zsoc> but this isn't an await thing/issue, it would be the same with an assignment or a return statement or anything else

[22:08:56] <velix> Crazy question: Can you create variables in a loop? Here, I want to use the "id" to setup variables and later put them into an object: https://bpa.st/FUBA
[22:10:03] <velix> AFAIK it works with eval() only, but that's evil?
[22:10:46] <velix> maybe window[] ?
[22:11:11] <velix> window['layer_' + ] <-- works
[22:11:12] <velix> thanks!
[22:11:28] <Alexendoo> velix: That creates a global, and is generally not very clean
[22:11:58] <velix> Alexendoo: okay, so eval() ?
[22:12:59] *** Joins: daoudr (~daoudr@178.197.208.229)
[22:13:13] <daoudr>  There is a numeric property for a number to have a decimal representation of length < 2. Saves you from converting the numbers twice.
[22:13:18] <daoudr> what is it called?
[22:13:23] <Alexendoo> velix: that's worse, the solution is to not dynamically create variable names. e.g. name it just layer and put it in the object with the appropriate key later, or put it directly in the object. Or if the ids are successive numbers use an array instead
[22:13:24] <Nachtgespenst> velix: Why not just an object/Map holding the keys?
[22:13:47] <velix> Nachtgespenst: Okay.
[22:13:50] <velix> Alexendoo: okay.
[22:14:10] <velix> I'll try.

[22:19:54] <systemfault> One of the best things with JS is the non-adoption of Dependency Injection Containers :p
[22:20:21] <qswz> yea, that oop bs makes me dizzy
[22:22:35] <systemfault> Unfortunately... a lot of TSer come from more OOP backgrounds, like C# and Java...
[22:22:49] <systemfault> So, their reflex is to reach for one.
[22:23:56] <ljharb> DI should just be function arguments.
[22:24:26] <systemfault> Yeah, but DI containers is just a solution to the usual Java-style overengineering problem
