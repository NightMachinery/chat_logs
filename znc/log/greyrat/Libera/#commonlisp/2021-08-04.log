[00:48:42] <jasom> did ESRAP stop doing backtracking suddenly?  I'm seeing (or X Y) fail to parse and (or Y X) succeed...
[00:49:43] <MichaelRaskin> ESRAP is packrat
[00:50:06] <MichaelRaskin> It must not do backtracking in such a situation, by specification
[00:50:10] <MichaelRaskin> Never did
[00:56:07] <jasom> that seems at odds with the description of "or" in the grammar.  Is it not always true that if X can parse a string than (or Y X) can parse it regardless of what Y is?
[00:56:50] <MichaelRaskin> Depends on your settings (trailing-garbage-allowed or not), but in the latter case, which I think is the default, no
[00:57:27] <jasom> "An ordered choice succeeds if any of the subexpressions succeeds, and consumes all the input consumed by the successful subexpression. An ordered choice produces whatever the successful subexpression produces.:
[00:57:33] <jasom> does that not mean what I think it means?
[00:58:18] <MichaelRaskin> On the top-level, by default the check is success _and_ consumption of the entire input
[00:58:39] <jasom> oh
[00:59:00] <jasom> so if Y matches a substring of the input then that will prevent it from checking if X can parse the entire input
[00:59:11] <MichaelRaskin> Yes
[01:01:11] <MichaelRaskin> It might be that packrat is just not the parsing model that you want to use right now for the current task, that happens. All general parsing models there are are somewhat suboptimal, so check what fits what…
[01:02:28] <jasom> This is easily worked around by a followed-by
[01:02:59] <MichaelRaskin> If the or is at the top level, yes
[01:03:04] <MichaelRaskin> But this does not compose
[01:03:10] <jasom> in this case it does
[01:04:19] <jasom> I need to parse things like the following: T12:34 T1234 T12:34:56 I can just check for the version without the : first and ad a (! #\:) to resolve the ambiguitiy between T12 and T12:34:56
[01:04:34] <MichaelRaskin> If something works only at the top level, this is not exactly enough to say this solution composes well (say, under concatenation)
[01:04:59] <jasom> in no case will it ever be followed by a colon
[01:06:02] *** Joins: pillton (~user@2405:b000:600:b0::36a)
[01:09:20] <jasom> I suppose to really make it compose I should have a (! digit) in the version that expects colons.
[01:09:49] <jasom> then they can be used in any order safely

[01:41:51] <nirnam> I did (let ((..)) (defun ...)) to keep persistant variable between function call, am I doing it right? or does it have more convensional way to keep data between fcuntion call
[01:42:06] <phoe> nirnam: you did a closure, and that's an OK approach
[01:42:29] <phoe> if this data needs to be accessible from outside, you can instead hold it in a global variable
[01:43:27] <_death> it also plays better with redefinitions.. basically (let ... (defun ...)) is not a good idea
[01:43:57] <nirnam> I don't want to pollute the global var namespace with it internal, if this was an ok approach I'm fine with it
[01:44:41] <phoe> _death meant that every reevaluation of the LET form is going to reset your value to the initial one
[01:44:53] <phoe> whereas e.g. DEFVAR is going to hold it through redefinitions
[01:45:21] <phoe> also it's not really polluting it, just keep the global variable symbol internal to your package and don't export it
[01:45:34] <_death> there's no need to worry about "pollution" here.. just use a descriptive name (with earmuffs) and be done with it
[01:46:50] <Bike> _death: hey thanks for mentioning the new sussman book, i impulse bought it and love it so far
[01:46:59] <nirnam> I still want it to keep it internal to itself, I find it easy to reason when everything about a function is gather in the same place
[01:47:43] <Bike> just keep in mind that reevaluating/recompiling the file the definition is in will reset the state

[03:08:30] <Bike> lisp-newbie: it sounds like you may be confused about how packages work. packages only name symbols. classes (and slots, and accessor functions) are not related to packages except that they may be named, and then that name is a symbol in a package
[03:08:58] <Bike> lisp-newbie: try fully qualifying the symbols you're referring to - like write mypackage::slot-a
[03:09:47] <Bike> and slots a parent defines are definitely going to be available in the child (unless maybe if you're doing exotic MOP stuff, but you aren't)

[12:58:32] <phoe> mutating a string that is a package name invokes UB, right?
[12:59:02] <beach> Good question.  I would think so.
[12:59:20] <phoe> CLHS Function PACKAGE-NAME and System Class PACKAGE do not mention this
[13:00:32] <phoe> it does confuse SBCL, as the altered package can no longer be FIND-PACKAGEd

[13:05:48] <hayley> While a "controversial" change, it wouldn't hurt to have the implementation copy the string?
[13:06:47] <beach> Right, both times.  Or stick the string in read-only memory.
[13:08:06] <hayley> I see that INTERN states it is UB to alter the string that names a symbol.

[13:10:58] <hayley> You don't tend to INTERN much in a loop, let alone MAKE-PACKAGE in a loop, so I don't think there are huge performance raisins for not copying. But again, my suggestion is evidently not what Lisp implementations already do.
[13:13:47] <kakuhen> what's the deal behind WSCL? it looks like i misinterpreted what it was supposed to be
[13:13:48] *** Quits: bpanthi977 (~Thunderbi@103.152.144.53) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:14:10] <kakuhen> i thought it was going to be something like a modernized version of the hyperspec but without all the pesky restrictions attached to it
[13:14:25] *** Quits: nature (~nature@mail.blazebone.com) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[13:15:33] <hayley> The result would be presentable like the HyperSpec (though, if you can use an extension which lets you add CSS to websites, it can be made to look nice), but I believe the idea is to clean up ambiguities left in the HyperSpec and ANSI standard.
[13:18:30] <kakuhen> Has there been discussion on the behavior of RANDOM yet? It seems that there could be better elaboration on "[a]n approximately uniform choice distribution"
[13:19:40] <kakuhen> say you want to generate random floats, one implementation may generate floats with uniform distribution over R but another one may not (although it may give a uniform distribution over the set of floats that it can possibly generate)
[13:19:57] <kakuhen> there's no way to tell without actually seeing how the implementation handles RANDOM
[13:28:15] <shka> kakuhen: i think that this nitpicking at this point
[13:28:39] <kakuhen> well, coming from a math background, this seems like a perfectly reasonable question to me
[13:28:57] <shka> the intention seems to be "not Gaussian distribution or anything like that"
[13:30:06] <shka> from the practical standpoint CL:RANDOM is perfectly well suited for most applications that require uniform random number, but probably not for the cryptography
[13:31:19] <shka> and i don't think that anything would change that
[13:31:54] <shka> besides, cl:hashtable can be implemented with linear scan and nobody seem to freak about it
[13:32:44] <kakuhen> OK. Let's say I decide to implement RANDOM such that we generate random floats that converge in distribution at an awfully slow rate (i.e. we need a very large N to be within  even a rather large epsilon of a uniformly distributed RV with the same image)
[13:33:06] <beach> kakuhen: The main idea with WSCL is to make sure that the Common Lisp LANGUAGE is safe, in addition to the majority of the implementations.  As it turns out, there are many situations in the standard where the behavior is undefined, and in many of those situations, it is not necessarily justified to leave the behavior undefined.
[13:33:08] <kakuhen> as long as there is a convergence in distribution, this seems to quality as "approximately uniform" but in practice that's obviously not going to be good enough for people who want something like a uniform dist
[13:33:16] <kakuhen> seems to qualify as*
[13:34:14] <kakuhen> beach: I see. So WSCL is more about clarifying corner cases of the spec, right?
[13:34:18] <shka> kakuhen: sure, in such case, you are getting bug requests to fix your cl:random
[13:35:02] <phoe> kakuhen: the fact that it's conforming doesn't mean that it's bug-free
[13:35:07] <phoe> (or useful)
[13:35:13] <kakuhen> OK there we go
[13:35:15] <beach> kakuhen: Slightly more ambitious than that.  It's about defining behavior in safe code (term defined by the glossary) in a way that most implementations already do.
[13:35:18] <kakuhen> phoe: That answers my question perfectly, actually
[13:35:38] <kakuhen> I was mistakenly believing conformity to the spec implied some level of correctness when I shouldn't have done so
[13:36:05] <phoe> you can conform by setting CL:ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE-LIMIT to 1024 in your implementation
[13:36:21] <phoe> but you really, really do not want to do this
[13:36:32] <beach> kakuhen: I think you are confusing "correctness" with "completeness".
[13:37:23] <phoe> ;; and regarding randomness there's always this https://www.incibe-cert.es/sites/default/files/blog/comprobando-aleatoriedad/dilbert.png comic
[13:37:32] <beach> kakuhen: If the standard explicitly says that in some situation, the behavior is undefined, then any behavior an implementation chooses to do is conforming.
[13:38:16] <beach> kakuhen: But, if it is not justified to have that situation imply undefined behavior, it is better to alter the specification to specify what happens in that situation.
[13:38:37] <shka> also, specifying things like random to such details in practice often in practice enforces the implementation strategy
[13:38:48] <jackdaniel> The random numbers are too important to leave them to chance.
[13:38:56] <shka> jackdaniel: nice one
[13:39:25] <jackdaniel> thanks
[13:39:59] <kakuhen> phoe: I've seen that comic several times before, and I've always had an issue with it, but I don't want to post too much offtopic ramblings in  here, heh.
[13:40:20] <jackdaniel> right, there are passages where in the safe code virtually every implementation will signal a condition - the problem is that each implementation will signal something different since it is not specified

[13:56:04] <beach> kakuhen: For example, the standard for the C language leaves the behavior unspecified in many situations.  Most C compilers take advantage of this situation to do whatever gives the highest performance, resulting in a language that is unfit for most programming tasks.
[13:56:11] <beach> kakuhen: The Common Lisp standard has many such situations as well, but the tradition for Common Lisp systems is to detect the situation and signal an error, at least when performance is not an issue.  So it seems reasonable at this point to transfer this tradition to the language specification, and very little needs to be done in implementations to conform.
[13:56:16] <beach> kakuhen: A similar thing would not work in the C language, because every existing compiler would then be in violation of the new specification, and C programmers seem to not mind using an unsafe language anyway, preferring maximum performance (for reasons I fail to understand, but hey).
[13:59:06] <nij-> Can't believe this happening. WSCL might be the first major hard fork of Common Lisp. Thanks for the work <3
[13:59:30] <nij-> (I mean it's going to be an effective fork. Similar, but effectively a new standard.)
[13:59:36] <beach> It is neither a fork nor major, which is the point.
[13:59:50] <nij-> Hopefully the diff won't be too large, and will be clearly doc in a file.
[14:00:10] <nij-> Not a fork?
[14:00:48] <beach> nij-: Not really.  Since every implementation of WSCL is also an implementation of Common Lisp, I wouldn't call that a "fork".
[14:01:47] <beach> It will be similar to the "strict HTML" tag that some web sites announce.
[14:01:58] <beach> An implementation would say "WSCL conforming".
[14:02:31] <nij-> What really defines Common Lisp? Is it CLHS?
[14:02:48] <beach> Sort of.  The standard, and the Common Lisp HyperSpec is pretty much the same as the standard.
[14:04:06] <nij-> I might being too picky - forgive me - but if CLHS is the definition of CL, and if CLHS contains some error, and if WSCL corrects those errors, then an impl of WSCL isn't really an impl of CL..
[14:04:22] <nij-> (It would be better, of course. But strictly speaking it won't be a CL impl...)
[14:05:03] <beach> nij-: The ambition is not to "correct errors".  It is to define situations where the standard explicitly says the behavior is undefined.

[14:05:42] <beach> nij-: So if the standard says that some behavior is undefined, and WSCL defines it, WSCL is still Common Lisp.

[14:08:19] <nij-> Yes. Going through the commit history again of WSCL indeed I haven't seen any error to be fixed.
[14:08:30] <beach> nij-: When a standard or a specification says that some behavior is undefined, it doesn't mean that an implementation of the standard has to behave in some unpredictable way.  It means that an implementation is free to behave in whatever way it sees fit.  So by taking such situations in the Common Lisp standard where a particular behavior seems reasonable, even though the standard doesn't say that, WSCL is still conforming.
[14:08:33] <nij-> My false impression could come from previous discussion..
[14:08:45] <nij-> Yep
[14:09:17] <nij-> Some time ago, iirc (hopefully), you mentioned there are some errors in clhs..
[14:09:40] <beach> Having said that, I admit that there are things in the standard, like PROG2, that are obvious mistakes, and we can correct those.  It would be uncontroversial as well.

[14:17:07] <beach> nij-: It doesn't have to be complete for it to be released.  It would be in several steps.  So we can just stop at some point and declare WSCL version 1 as frozen.

[14:32:42] <beach> lisp123: What is the return value of PROCESS-WAIT?
[14:33:42] <beach> lisp123: Apparently, it can be a function, so it is not a Boolean value.  Therefor using that return value with OR or WHEN is a violation of the rule stated on page 13 of the LUV slides.

[14:34:54] <beach> Er, with only a `then' branch, I mean.
[14:35:21] <beach> So either the value is used, and there should be an explicit `else' branch, or the value is not used, and the IF should be turned into a WHEN.

[17:45:44] <nij-> Guy Steele gave a talk back in 2010 with a main message that programming language should take care of parallelism itself; programmers shouldn't worry that.
[17:46:15] <lisp123> beach: Thanks. However, I thought it was an accepted paradigm to use logical operators as control structures and not just for boolean. Per CLTL: Common Lisp provides three operators on Boolean values: and, or, and not. Of these, and and or are also control structures because their arguments are evaluated conditionally. The function not necessarily examines its single argument, and so is a simple function.
[17:46:21] <nij-> I think it would be nice if SBCL can achieve that. Imagine having SBCLs on multiple nodes in a network, handling the parallelism themselves.
[17:46:42] <nij-> The question now is that - is it possible?
[17:46:54] <lisp123> So I thin Norvig's suggestion to use and, or only for boolean values seems a bit heavy handed in that context
[17:47:05] <phoe> nij-: swank-crew maybe
[17:49:40] <nij-> O_O my eyes wide opened. Thanks phoe
[17:49:56] <beach> lisp123: Sure, but that's not the point.  The fact that an expression always yields a Boolean value is an issue that is orthogonal with the time it is evaluated.

[17:50:02] <shka> nij-: bolting DSL for distributed programming is possible, but non-trivial
[17:50:36] <beach> lisp123: Here is an example of the distinction...
[17:50:54] <beach> lisp123: Suppose you have an operator like FIND-CLASS.
[17:51:28] <beach> lisp123: It can either return a class object, or a default value when there is no class with the name you supply.  That default value happens to be NIL.
[17:51:43] <beach> lisp123: But FIND-CLASS is not returning a Boolean value.
[17:52:13] <nij-> phoe:  Do you know the internal of swant-client? Like how it works?
[17:52:40] <nij-> I've asked multiple times here if there's a way to serialize functions well, and the answer was always negative.
[17:52:49] <lisp123> beach: And in this case we don't want to associated the default object with false?
[17:52:52] <nij-> In this case, how can multiple lisp repls work together?
[17:52:57] <beach> lisp123: So, if you do (let ((potential-class (find-class ...))) (when potential-class ...)) you are using a non-Boolean in a position where a Boolean should be used.
[17:53:24] <beach> lisp123: The good way of doing that is (unless (null potential-class) ...)
[17:53:59] <lisp123> I see. Because I always do the former on the basis that any value not nil is T
[17:54:00] <beach> lisp123: Because then NULL is the operator that tests whether the default value was returned, and NULL returns a Boolean, which can then be used in the UNLESS form.
[17:54:54] <beach> lisp123: I am not talking about what you always do.  I am talking about the expectations that the person reading your code might have, as discussed by Pitman and Norvig on page 13 of the LUV slides.
[17:55:15] <phoe> nij-: swank-client?
[17:55:24] <lisp123> But I can see how the second version is a bit more explicit. My bigger question is (or A B) --> If you have to separate the the test for boolean from the evaluation, doesn't that mean you have to evaluate twice?
[17:55:25] <phoe> it's a client for swank, nothing surprising there
[17:55:41] <beach> lisp123: When I see (WHEN POTENTIAL-CLASS ...) I have to stop and mentally turn it into the other variant before I understand it and that slows me down.
[17:55:48] <phoe> where swank here means swank-the-network-protocol that swank-the-server uses

[18:04:54] <phoe> I remember we talked about that some time ago

[18:06:12] <hayley> Usually when I write parallel code, it still uses shared memory (i.e. we run everything on the same process). If you only have one fast computer, you aren't making a mistake to assume shared memory in my opinion.
[18:07:11] <beach> lisp123: For example, in C my students would avoid introducing a local variable inside a `for' loop, because "then the variable had to be created in each iteration", so they increased the scope instead, making the code harder to understand.

[18:23:24] <hayley> As I understand it (note: I absolutely don't) you just want to run tasks in parallel. So you don't need another REPL, just some threads or something.
[18:23:40] <phoe> nij-: it seems that you want s/repl/process/
[18:24:04] <phoe> you can have ten REPLs running inside a single process, and you can have ten processes all running without a single REPL.

[18:33:49] <phoe> and for this particular issue you're more interested in the second aspect

[18:34:36] <beach> nij-: And then the source language doesn't matter much.
[18:34:44] <phoe> a good thing is that this is mostly language-indepe--exactly what beach said
[18:35:41] <beach> nij-: I recommend Steven Muchnick's book for that.
[18:36:33] <beach> nij-: That book is a good overview of techniques, and the general descriptions are good.  But if you ever want to write a compiler, whatever you do, don't base it on his code.

[19:15:34] <hayley> C2 apparently uses an arena allocator, and so does the frontend of Clang.
[19:16:45] <beach> But that gives more responsibility to the programmer to determine liveness.
[19:16:59] <hayley> So garbage collection could be somewhat better on the cache, provided that there are temporary objects which die.
