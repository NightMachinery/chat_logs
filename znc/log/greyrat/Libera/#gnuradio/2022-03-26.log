[00:00:57] <andres_san[m]> yeah, i read that GNU is made for linux not for windows, so i've tried WSL2, but i dont hace access to the GUI
[00:01:06] <andres_san[m]> so my only chance is to run in on a VM
[00:01:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> Ryan Volz, who built the radioconda installer for Windows is on here from time to time.
[00:02:22] <andres_san[m]> oh my!
[00:02:25] <andres_san[m]> I'll hang out then =)
[00:03:02] <andres_san[m]> oh, here is ryan 
[00:04:09] <RyanVolz[m]> I have been summoned! Let me try your flowgraph on my Windows install.
[00:05:09] <andres_san[m]> hooray!

[00:07:19] <andres_san[m]> there!, 3.10.1.1
[00:09:23] <RyanVolz[m]> Alright, it's not a Windows thing. Open your "Options" block and change "Run" from "Off" to "Autostart".

[00:31:29] <andres_san[m]> Mmm has anybody used GNU with LimeSDR? the module options seem fairly different from what it is supposed to be: 
[00:31:45] <andres_san[m]> that is how it looks
[00:31:54] <andres_san[m]> and this is should it be: 
[00:32:18] <BjoernKerler[m]> yes. use custom soapy

[00:32:28] <BjoernKerler[m]> and then set driver=lime in the options
[00:34:15] <Myon> andres_san[m]: the limesdr source/sink works here (https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-limesdr.git)
[00:34:37] <andres_san[m]> thanks both! i'll look into it
[00:34:48] <Myon> the git repos are a mess, though, so soapy might be the saner option
[00:35:01] <BjoernKerler[m]> I'm using it for my tests, works fine so far.

[00:43:49] <BjoernKerler[m]> not sure but it should be available via apt I think, if not you could either compile on the device or cross-compile
[00:44:02] <ron[m]12> The problem I was having was when I use apt install it installs 3.8 version 
[00:44:03] <ron[m]12> And when I used apt-get-repository it gave me a error 
[00:44:18] <ron[m]12> The repo is in Ubuntu not debian
[00:44:23] <BjoernKerler[m]> ah ok, then try to compile either directly or cross compile.
[00:44:41] <BjoernKerler[m]> at least that's what I did with 3.11
[00:44:42] <ron[m]12> Can you explain how that is done?
[00:44:56] <BjoernKerler[m]> compiling just as it's in the gnuradio wiki
[00:45:44] <BjoernKerler[m]> you will need to compile volk first, then gnuradio. and if you want soapysdr, this as well with the soapy hardware module
[00:45:53] <BjoernKerler[m]> I will soon push a full install script with all modules
[00:46:09] <BjoernKerler[m]> but basically it's all in the gnuradio wiki

[00:47:08] <ron[m]12> Sorry I can't seem to find it. I can see install volk and other depenencies 
[00:47:10] <BjoernKerler[m]> use the "from source" section
[00:47:14] <ron[m]12> Okay
[00:48:11] <BjoernKerler[m]> you just need to disable the x86 cpu optimizations as special option
[00:48:19] <BjoernKerler[m]> need to search if I can find it
[00:48:33] <ron[m]12> Can I use pisdr?
[00:48:50] <BjoernKerler[m]> possibly I think yes

Maybe there are other options you can pass in to the lime driver using the options and stream entries or on the other tabs?

[02:05:40] <patchvonbraun[m]> I will note that most of my flow-graphs are hardware agnostic, so I never pick a specifc piece of hardware at graph build time, but rather defer to runtime.  In gr-osmosdr, I know how to do this, but in this new "SoapySDR made in-tree" stuff, I'm not sure.

[02:14:33] <Myon> clearly someone needs to write a soapy driver for osmosdr
[02:14:54] <patchvonbraun[m]> That already exists
[02:15:07] <Myon> heh
[02:15:44] <Myon> (sorry I just saw too many abstract-all-the-audio-things-away drivers. Latest one discovered: libao4)
[02:16:05] <patchvonbraun[m]> If your gr-osmosdr has SoapySDR support, you can just use "soapysdr,<argsyoudpasstosoapy>"
[02:16:22] <patchvonbraun[m]> Since there isn't a NATIVE Lime driver for gr-osmosdr, that's how i can support LimeSDR in some of my apps.
[02:18:13] <willcode4[m]> n1ai: You're right that the built-in grc files for soapy drivers are minimal. They are also easy to update with more options. We put them in there just to have something people could use to try it out, and I'm (still) not getting around to adding more options myself.

[04:16:18] <BjoernKerler[m]> patchvonbraun: based on our tests, performance with gr-osmosdr can be much worse, especially with the airspy, if it's putting through to soapy. Then it's better to use soapy directly. For ettus however, both soapy and gr-osmosdr do not make much sense and uhd is recommended. But from all approaches for universal sdr usage, the soapy one seems to be best imho, but the quality does vary depending on the driver implementation of course.
[04:20:09] <BjoernKerler[m]> @schneider I think I found the issue, some pointed me to it. The cause for my problems seems to be the tagged stream block. Some recommend to increase the shared memory (under linux : "sudo sysctl -w kernel.shmmax=2147483648") which helped a bit.

[04:35:40] <patchvonbraun[m]> For gr-osmosdr, there's very little in the way of "shims" on the data path for UHD.  GR "sees" the appropriate multi_usrp object. and uses it as if you'd used the UHD sink/source.    Like said, my apps are largely agnostic, and I'm not going to force my users to dive into the source code and change things depending on what kind of device they have.  I'd like to keep my sanity for a little while longer, please.

[16:49:21] <drmpeg> Do you have anything in /usr/local/lib/cmake/gnuradio? There should be many files in that directory.
[16:50:07] <drmpeg> 100 files.
[16:53:45] <l4rrybr3nt[m]> hm, I started again from a blank image, hackrf, volk, gnuradio, osmocom and this time it built fine. So I messed up something down that path. It just finished compiling now. :)

[21:08:36] <duude__> Hey people :) I'm learning gnuradio. Is there a more efficient way of doing this? https://i.imgur.com/csUOlht.png
[21:08:39] <duude__> I have three questions
[21:09:11] <duude__> 1. I noiced my WBFM signals are 24kHz wide, what controls their width? How do you make them smaller/wider?
[21:10:16] <duude__> 2. I tried to make them appear 50kHz distant from each other, but I'm not sure how resampler is exactly working, what happens is that my 5kHz signal getting multiplied with one from resampler moves the signal by 65kHz
[21:10:44] <duude__> So 5kHz multiplied with resampler here = 65kHz, how do I calculate the actual value? What's going "behind the scenes" ?
[21:11:52] *** Quits: _filename (~kilitary@188.242.105.134) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[21:12:11] <duude__> 3. Is there a more efficient way of doing this for more than three signals? (Having a wav file get wideband frequency modulated and then "repeated" multiple times) Let's say I don't know, 5, 10, 15. Just giving out random numbers that come to my mind here

[23:25:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> What is the porting strategy for code that worked just fine in 3.8, using "firdes".  Such FGs now blow up when you bring them into GR in 3.9.   This is, i have to say, continuing compatibility insanity.
[23:27:07] <patchvonbraun[m]> I wrote a 3.8 FG a few months back, on Ubuntu-the-most-up-to-date-I-could-get-at-the-time, thinking that the user base would be well supported, since most of them were using Ubuntu.  Now, I have a user with Fedora 35, with GR 3.9.x, and the firdes calls are blowing up.  This makes me anti-happy.
[23:37:43] <duude__> willcode4: Okay I just went over omst of the things, I understand the majority now :) I just want to confirm one piece of info
[23:37:57] <duude__> So, polyphase channelizer works by having "banks", but they must be equal
[23:38:05] <duude__> What if I wish to have unequal distances?
[23:38:21] <duude__> Like, poly. channeliz. would allow me to do lets say
[23:38:33] <duude__> -16 -8 DC 8 16
[23:38:57] <duude__> what if I want, -13 -5.5 2 13 33 for example
[23:39:06] <duude__> Then I can't use polyphase channelizer, yeah?

[23:56:53] <funkylab[m]> ah, it's one bank, a bank of filters, or just filterbank. Yes, they are equal, as you feed it with one prototype filter, and that gets replicated for every channel
[23:56:58] <willcode4[m]> patchvonbraun: Reselect the window type and save.
[23:57:40] <funkylab[m]> and you're right, with non-integer spacing of channels, you can't use the polyphase channelizer
[23:58:38] <willcode4[m]> Sometimes you can get fancy and cascade filter banks. Or combine filter banks and xlating filters.
[23:59:59] <funkylab[m]> exactly what willcode says! You could pre-filter into equal bands and then use something more flexible to select the subbands you're interested in. Your specific example isn't that great, because if you simply used twice as many channels you could have -26, -11, 4, 26, 66, and that would work (but if you only need 5 out of >=66 or even >=132 channels, you'd probably not use polyphase filter banks, but a set of separate, independent
[23:59:59] <funkylab[m]> filters, anyways, or go through the multiple-stage tricks as described by willcode4 )
