[04:16:47] <Rikem> does |default and |yesno error on undefined variables or see them as None?
[04:17:44] <schinckel> You could use a similar technique but just log to the logger when it hits an undefined variable.
[04:17:59] <schinckel> Not by default, I don’t think.
[04:18:21] <GinFuyou> |default seem to handle undefined just fine
[04:27:21] <Rikem> stats4647: {{ note.company.name|default:'' }}
[04:28:16] <stats4647> Rikem: thanks but what happens if I leave out the |default filter? based on what everyone said, there won't be any errors
[04:28:59] <Rikem> it will just be blank like GinFuyou mentioned
[04:29:12] <Rikem> so actually the |default isn't even required
[04:30:04] <stats4647> Rikem: right, and I would have to add a yesno to get the trailing "_", so I might as well do through an IF
[04:31:04] <Rikem> Do you want the trailing "-" even if the note.company is empty?

[04:50:06] <truk_87> So in theory, if a service that I currently use hosts such things as technical information about equipment (ie. mfg, model, serial #, price, maintenance records) and the service is accessed via website.  If they have an API endpoint that allows access, I should be able to GET database records from them, then parse them and perform additional data processing thru my own Django app?

[10:47:03] <dre> pidroid, django has most of that out of the box
[10:47:10] <dre> you don't need anything
[10:49:43] <evidlo> did something change with CORS on the devserver in the last five years?  I don't remember it being so annoying
[10:50:19] <evidlo> I'm working with newbies and we constantly run into CORS errors when were just trying to test an app locally
[10:51:01] <FunkyBob> dodobrain: i mean... probably?  I don't plan  that far ahead :P
[10:51:52] <FunkyBob> evidlo: why are you making cross-origin requests with newbies?
[10:53:47] <ktosiek[m]> evidlo: browsers are getting more picky about CORS, even on localhost
[10:54:00] <FunkyBob> pidroid: password reset is built in... registration with email confirm is  easily to build on using built in tools

[11:59:43] <pidroid> FunkyBob i'm not sure but i think it better for heavy load management (load balancing, several backends), better security (my front is in quasar/vuejs)
[12:00:07] <pidroid> my project target a lot of user (if it works ^^)
[12:00:39] <pidroid> i want to avoid scalability problems and/or authentication/billing problems
[12:02:02] <dodo> pidroid: auth is very pluggable. no need for premature optimization
[12:02:21] <pidroid> for registration in the link, it's outside DRF, i can't use it i'm right ?
[12:10:15] <pidroid> i try to find an example of complete auth system with DRF (permissions, auth, email confirmation, email instead of username etc). I you have an open source project with that, i'll be happy to see it

[12:21:41] <elmcrest> goog morning everybody. it seems I can't find the documentation for django-rest-framework version 3.10 --- any hints appreciated :D
[12:22:01] <elmcrest> might be something obvious I'm missing?
[12:22:46] <elmcrest> nevermind I'll ask in the restframework channel
[12:23:04] <FunkyBob> pidroid: there's a lot of assertions there without any evidence
[12:23:23] <FunkyBob> generally tokens are _less_ secure... because most of the time you can't revoke them
[12:24:34] <FunkyBob> elmcrest: have you tried asking in the DRF channel?
[12:25:22] <FunkyBob> ah, I need to read before answering :P
[12:25:35] <FunkyBob> pidroid: why do  you think using  tokens will be more scalable? why do yu think they're more secure?
[12:25:46] <elmcrest> FunkyBob just did, thx
[12:26:01] <FunkyBob> as for registration... the example I gave uses built in views, showing how you can do it without needing a 3rd party lib
[12:26:21] <FunkyBob> it wouldn't be hard to wrap that in DRF stuff but... why?
[12:26:28] <elmcrest> FunkyBob there are only 9 users though ... feels a little wrong to me ... but the homepage refers to #restframework
[12:27:19] <dodo> tiddies
[12:27:41] <FunkyBob> elmcrest: yes... people go there, see there's few people, and leave... wondering why there's so few people there
[12:27:57] <pidroid> ho there is a DRF chan ?
[12:28:24] <FunkyBob> yes
[12:28:29] <FunkyBob> it's right there on the DRF web page
[12:28:41] <FunkyBob> https://www.django-rest-framework.org/#support
[12:28:43] <elmcrest> pidroid #restframework
[12:29:04] <pidroid> FunkyBob i'm still a beginner with django/DRF, i'm not sure to do well and i can do mistakes or missunderstanding
[12:29:10] <pidroid> oups sorry :s
[12:29:22] <elmcrest> I thought they've had a version switch for the docs similar to Django but I might be wrong ... can't find any other versions though. that's kind of weird, isn't it?
[12:29:39] <elmcrest> pidroid fail forward that's the right thing! :)
[12:30:06] <FunkyBob> elmcrest: not all that weird
[12:30:17] <FunkyBob> if there's a version on readthedocs, that's likely to have a version switch
[12:30:38] <pidroid> <FunkyBob> generally tokens are _less_ secure... because most of the time you can't revoke them >>> that's right
[12:31:03] <FunkyBob> pidroid: right, but _you_ said you're choosing tokens because you think/feel they're _more_ secure
[12:31:06] <FunkyBob> why do you think that?
[12:31:13] <pidroid> 09:55 <FunkyBob> pidroid: why do you think using tokens will be more scalable? why do yu think they're more secure? >>> more scalable because no need to store the session, a token is valid for all backends without anything
[12:31:26] <dminuoso> FunkyBob: What do you propose instead of tokens?
[12:31:48] <dminuoso> About the only alternative is that you have the client cryptographically sign each message, as a kind of zero knowledge proof.
[12:31:56] <FunkyBob> dminuoso: until I see a reason otherwise, I stick with the default django auth machinery
[12:32:05] <dminuoso> FunkyBob: And that does what?
[12:32:26] <FunkyBob> auth info stashed in the session, which is referenced by a cookie

[12:32:45] <elmcrest> FunkyBob not really in case that's the right thing https://django-rest-framework.readthedocs.io
[12:33:08] <FunkyBob> pidroid: by "all backends" do you mean "all instances"?
[12:33:18] <FunkyBob> elmcrest: there was a chance...
[12:33:51] <pidroid> FunkyBob yes, all instances of the same source (maybe with different options for manage some specific features)
[12:34:09] <pidroid> (only for the futur)
[12:34:21] <pidroid> i hope to keep this possibility
[12:34:35] <FunkyBob> pidroid: yes, with a token you can validate the token was issued by a trusted source... and that can avoid a DB hit for your session
[12:35:24] <FunkyBob> however, again, in that case you are stuck with -- if someone steals a token, you can't invalidate it
[12:35:34] <FunkyBob> without invalidating ALL tokens signed by the same issuer
[12:35:59] <pidroid> i look for manage api rest between backend (DRF) and fron (quasar/vusjs) without JWT (i don't remember why i give up this possibility except for scalabilty)
[12:36:34] <pidroid> i agree with this point
[12:36:35] <FunkyBob> if you need a 3rd party auth service, or the ability to delegate subsets of rights... tokens start making sense
[12:36:40] <FunkyBob> though there are better options than JWT
[12:40:15] <elmcrest> you could encode a session into the JWT, no?

[19:33:05] <LordKalma> and you basically get everything for free

[19:33:48] <LordKalma> and then automagically be authed in: https://i.gyazo.com/f756d1d5370927de7857dcb13bdebbe0.png
[19:37:44] <LordKalma> pidroid, basically session-based means you can still use /admin and the web-api pages. The token based for use on your frontend. that's what I recal reading
[19:38:00] <LordKalma> do note, though, that you'll want to use HTTPS in any token-based deployment :p
[19:38:10] <LordKalma> well, you'll want to use HTTPS always anyway

[19:45:35] <pidroid> i'll look at this for the book (expensive but maybe required ?)
[19:51:02] <LordKalma> it has it's usefulness

[20:39:03] <lbracher> Hello! If I want to filter objects that have a field equals None, I do, for instance, `Products.objects.filter(vendor=None).all()`. But how can I do to filter those that are not None? TIA!

[21:30:02] <pandafy> Hello everyone! I am using django-channels to send notifications to frontend using websockets.
[21:30:02] <pandafy> I want to know what is the recommended architecture for implementing something like this.
[21:30:03] <pandafy> Should I create one chanel layer group for all connected users or create a group for each user?

[23:38:04] <ktosiek[m]> I'm looking for a way to better manage migrations around deployments. So far I'm running migrations before deployment, but that creates some races - if I have a migration that fills in data, the old app will still create incomplete rows.
[23:38:35] <ktosiek[m]> Also I have to remember to add a copy of such data fixing migration if the deployment fails.
[23:40:31] <ktosiek[m]> I know about django-safemigrate, and I'll probably start using it. Is there anything else I should look at?
