[02:21:56] <tomreyn> morganu: there are two possible reasons i can think of why chrome would become inresponsice in the situation you described: (1) the ram running full, (2) the HDD or connection to it being too slow to transfer all the data (of both the ram being swpped to disk, to free up RAM, as well as the new updated being written to disk) in time.
[02:21:58] *** Joins: gggpkm_ (~gggpkm@60.10.194.46)
[02:23:01] <tomreyn> morganu: to get a better idea of whether it may be the HDD, i wanted to see what the SATA bandwidth is between the HDD and the CPU, which is where this data would flow at the time.
[02:23:38] *** Joins: gggpkm__ (~gggpkm@60.10.194.46)
[02:24:49] <tomreyn> morganu: but most likely the problem will be a combination of the two: not so fast disk writes, and a need to both swap out memory to disk while also eneding to write updates (i think the updates already downloads and installs some updates before it prompts you to also install others)

[02:27:04] <tomreyn> morganu: you could buy an SSD to replace the HDD as a system disk, this *may* solve the problem. but you might lso want more RAM if you will run the default gnome desktop (which is a bit heavy on RAM - but there are others), and maybe the you also need a newer cpu - i do not know / remember what you have there.

[02:36:01] <tomreyn> morganu:so you have a SATA 3 (6.0 gigabit/second) connection to the HDD, which is a 7200 rpm Seagate Barracuda "7200.14" with 500GB capacity. An SSD may help tremendously, depending on which CPU you have in there. the command     cat /proc/cpuinfo     or just    lscpu   should tell.

[02:40:21] <morganu> tomreyn, I use chrome.
[02:40:45] <morganu> that's why I say chrome when speaking of my browser. (BTW the same thing happens with ff)
[02:41:34] *** Quits: dbungert (~dbungert@canonical/dbungert) (Quit: .)
[02:41:37] <tomreyn> morganu: okay, i was just wondering whether it's chrome or chromium because some people actually don't separate them as you do, think of them as the same, but they are packaged differently, so it can matter.
[02:41:44] <TJ-> morganu: this updater that is in the background (behind chrome window) how does it get there? does it start on its own and drop behind the chrome window, or do you have some interaction with it first?
[02:41:46] <gschanuel> I basically followed this guide from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/hybrid/server/best-practices/vmware-ubuntu-template, but before shutting down the vm I ran `cloud-init clean && cloud-init clean -l`
[02:42:16] <tomreyn> morganu: but if this also happens with firefox, that's more likely a general issue then.
[02:43:12] <morganu> tomreyn, I never see the updater dialog box until I use terminal to kill chrome
[02:43:34] <TJ-> tomreyn: unless gnome does things differently, the GUI package updater dialog needs to be told to go ahead, or "remind me later"
[02:43:45] <TJ-> tomreyn: and it does nothing unless given permission

[..] It wwould make sense to be bale to have these updates automatic and not waiting for my personal approval."
[02:44:34] <TJ-> morganu: ^^^ what is the dialog for the updater showing when you reveal it? is it showing packages being updated, ir just sitting there waiting?

[02:45:22] <tomreyn> TJ-: i think update-manager works the same on gnome as it works on other graphical desktops

[02:46:37] <TJ-> morganu: can you show us " journalctl --user -b 0 | nc termbinc.com 9999 "
[02:46:51] <tomreyn> TJ-: i *think* i've had updatemnagaer automatically install security updates, then prompts and ask whether i want it to also install non security updates - that's the sceanrio i was thinking of
[02:46:55] <gschanuel> and before converting to a template I ran `govc -e guestinfo.userdata="${USERDATA}"` with $USERDATA being `export USERDATA=$(gzip -c9 <userdata.yaml | { base64 -w0 2>/dev/null || base64; })` what may I be missing here?
[02:47:19] <tomreyn> * update-manager
[02:47:56] <tomreyn> TJ-: but things may actually have changed more with the ubuntu software store snap

[11:25:22] <alkisg> It might mean "just give it the same ip when it asks again"
[11:25:31] <alkisg> OK, let's see then
[11:25:52] <unixbeard> I have not been enjoying new hardware; my monitor doesn't detect activity on this workstation, but I think it was in sleep mode?  I installed caffeine to just disable it even though I thought I disabled all sleep related crud on here.
[11:26:16] <unixbeard> Okay, yeah, I am not sure.  It shows no start/end time for lease on static assigned stuff, but that's pfsense/bsd and I'm not sure how the dhcpd works on there.
[11:26:26] <unixbeard> The non-static lease stuff does have start/end times listed for lease.
[11:26:27] <alkisg> You can check the monitor status over ssh, without waking it up locally
[11:26:39] <unixbeard> On the local network, ssh/ping dies inbound/out on that system.
[11:27:08] <unixbeard> So I tried to ssh to it from my nearby windows system, and ping it, and it is effectively dead after it goes to sleep.  I can ssh to another ubuntu system with mostly similar hardware upstairs.
[11:27:11] <alkisg> When monitor goes off?
[11:27:14] <alkisg> Or when the intel issue happens?
[11:27:36] <alkisg> Ah if the system goes to sleep, its a completely different thing than if the monitor goes to sleep
[11:27:52] <alkisg> Suspend/resume might be buggy due to a lot of kernel drivers or system hooks
[11:27:54] <unixbeard> Well the monitor is another PITA, it's a curved gaming monitor and I have it plugged into a power switch because it has a hardware problem (samsung g7?)
[11:29:33] <unixbeard> So I just power cycle it when I need a display, otherwise it will not 'wake up' and detect either system if it's been idle long enough.  There's actually a hardware issue there ... I declined having it repaired, anyway.

[13:10:12] <TJ-> Nitrigaur: let me state some facts. 1. as initrd.img has a /cryptroot/crypttab that tells us cryptsetup-initramfs hooks were triggered when "update-initramfs" ran. That means they saw an entry in /etc/crypttab that is a container for the root-fs. The hook script then should read /etc/crypttab line that matches, then write a modified form of that line to the /tmp/.mkinitramfs/cryptroot/crypttab file
[13:10:14] <TJ-> in the initrd.img it is assembling.
[13:10:22] <BCB> sorry if I missed a previous response
[13:10:49] <TJ-> Nitrigaur: from that you can see that either the 'write' process failed or, when the system boots, somehow that file is corrupted within the initrd-img, which seems more unlikely

[14:21:03] <Bardon> Hello, I'm on 21.10, I'd like to use Eclipse to run some java code. I did sudo snap install eclipse --classic, then I believe I did sudp apt install default-jre (but it was a long time ago so I'm note sure). At least I have "default-jre/impish,now 2:1.11-72build1 amd64" installed
[14:21:19] <Bardon> But when I try to run the code, it says "ava.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: Main has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 59.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 55.0"
[14:21:43] <Bardon> So, can I just class file version 59.0 on Ubuntu?
[14:24:36] <Bardon> I have "OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.12+7-Ubuntu-0ubuntu3)" and "openjdk version "11.0.12" 2021-07-20"

[16:52:59] <Andy_Flatline> There's a weird problem with my Ubuntu 20.04. When I first turn on the laptop, it is extremely laggy for about 10 minutes. I mean, so bad that the mouse pointer will barely work and the keyboard will barely type letters. All of the windows take much longer to open, etc. So virtually unusable. When I leave the laptop alone for 10-15 minutes. This strange lagginess goes away. Has anyone encountered this problem before?
[16:56:23] <tomreyn> Andy_Flatline: is this a fresh 20.04 installation, or did you upgrade? which cpu and how much RAM?
[16:57:47] <tomreyn> to answer the last two questions and enable us to look for hardware / firmware related problems, you could run this to share the first 1000 lines of your system log:   journalctl -b | nc termbin.com 9999    post the url it reports here

[19:47:22] <tomreyn> euouae: lack of ram can also cause weird installation issues. but most of the time it's due to broken (removable) flash storage

[20:21:02] <FreeBDSM> there's no general solution for this problem

[20:21:32] <euouae> You could go with debian instead of ubuntu and not have to worry so much about this
[20:21:33] <alkisg> Older ones get the same experience with 18.04 mate, yet with some security considerations, and that's acceptable to many schools
[20:22:01] <FreeBDSM> stuff is always broken in one way or the other (security vulns or broken functionality / ux / habits)

[21:15:36] <Sven_vB> hi! on focal I ran "ubuntu-drivers autoinstall" in hopes it would make my video capture card work. it installed some nvidia drivers. after reboot, my initrd output is written in huge letters (80x25 text mode probably), and X fails to start with "(EE) Fatal server error:(EE) no screens found(EE)". is there an easy way to recover?
[21:15:39] <FreeBDSM> you see, the package contents seem to differ in size, but the lists of files are the same, but then I noticed package's version got also bumped
[21:17:39] <Sven_vB> otherwise, I'd reinstall, but my script for that includes "ubuntu-drivers autoinstall" usually. do I need to disable that entirely for this machine, or can I exclude the breaking driver specifically?

[21:25:22] <TJ-> FreeBDSM: a package that doesn't have "ubuntu" in its version is directly imported from Debian, so you'll find the source there. Best way to then drill down is via Debian Package Tracker to find bugs, source-code, etc.,.e.g  https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/pdsh
