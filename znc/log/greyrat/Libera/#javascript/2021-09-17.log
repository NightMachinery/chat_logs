[04:37:54] <theskillwithin> KindSoul2l3l Yes, but I think you already had one lol

[04:38:55] <theskillwithin> the passwords are probably encrypted anyways hehe
[04:38:56] <KindSoul2l3l> i have configure ipv6 before
[04:39:02] <neshpion> KindSoul2l3l: people once told me that a cloak/hostmask isn't a real cure, but i'm unsure of what exploits there are over the IRC protocol.  but people can figure it out if they send you a link to their own website and see your HTTP request
[04:39:07] <spynxic> Memory, risk laden?
[04:39:09] <neshpion> so in that case a VPN will be a better solution
[04:39:23] <neshpion> but honestly, i don't know what kinds of attacks one can even try on a user's computer with only an IP address
[04:40:15] <hassoon> i use irc from within a server of mine
[04:40:24] <theskillwithin> znc ftw
[04:40:27] <hassoon> 'sup ip
[04:40:28] <KindSoul2l3l> well there is tool actually and methods that if you dont update your system very often can get into a trouble ;)
[04:40:29] * neshpion uses tor :^)
[04:40:31] <hassoon> theskillwithin: right
[04:40:43] <theskillwithin> i worry more about doxing than haxing
[04:41:14] <KindSoul2l3l> neshpion: how you use tor? tor is banned for some irc due many abuse i test it xd
[04:41:30] <hassoon> theskillwithin: sometimes lag ruins my typing, but overally it's fine
[04:41:31] <KindSoul2l3l> yea doxing is worse
[04:42:57] <neshpion> KindSoul2l3l: in libera's case, it has an .onion link, so you use that in place of irc.libera.chat (or whatever the official link is) -- the .onion address should be available on the website, as well as instructions for what is required to connect via it
[04:42:58] <theskillwithin> https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/97/
[04:43:44] <neshpion> KindSoul2l3l: other IRC networks do indeed block Tor exit nodes, in which case VPN can suffice, or perhaps Tor->VPN/Proxy->IRC network could work, but that introduces so much lag

[10:50:03] <shan> carlino3: you should always try and do styling in CSS imo :3 but also, i'd leave a comment explaining the formula
[10:50:46] <carlino3> right, i'm sure i wont understand anything tomorrow lol
[10:54:51] <theskillwithin> hehe noticed u cross posted
[10:55:03] <shan> carlino3: it's chiefly the magic numbers
[10:55:40] <theskillwithin> im only op in here, not over there, so ill let it slide 😘
[10:55:40] <carlino3> theskillwithin it is related to css and javascript, so...
[10:55:46] <DPA> The usage of "transform: translate" is often a sign that there are better CSS ways to do it.
[10:56:16] <carlino3> DPA like for example?
[10:56:44] <theskillwithin> carlino3 id much rather you do this in css, than what you had planned before, by far
[10:57:09] <theskillwithin> carlino3 altho woulda been nice if it was in a codepen or jsfiddle so we could see the css in action,  but doesn't matter
[10:57:18] <theskillwithin> the answer is css
[10:58:22] <DPA> Like, sometimes "transform: translate" is used to center things, when really it'd be better to just use a flexbox or something. Sometimes it could be done directly with left: top:, and similar things.
[10:58:55] <shan> flexbox is magic and should be worshipped

[11:06:29] <theskillwithin> I like that ur using css, but now I highly suspect your overcomplicating things
[11:07:44] <carlino3> theskillwithin why?
[11:08:07] <theskillwithin> well this looks to be like some sort of game,  and I think you mentioned before you were using vue
[11:08:22] <carlino3> correct
[11:08:37] <theskillwithin> vue has ability to do state stuff
[11:09:14] <theskillwithin> so u could have the entire bottom be in its own div, and then the the left of it have that bubble, and that bubble is determined by state
[11:09:38] <theskillwithin> im more of a react guy so i can't talk specifics in vue
[11:10:07] <theskillwithin> but i assume theres gotta be some sorta logic here eventaully, if this is a game ur making
[11:10:27] <carlino3> oh yes,i could use something like flexbox. but then the cards should move to the center with an animation and that complicates it more
[11:10:34] *** Quits: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[11:10:47] <theskillwithin> ahh animation does complicate it more
[11:11:03] <carlino3> so i decided to use absolute positions, all things floating inside the game area
[11:12:03] <shan> if you use absolute positioning then why are you fucking around with transform /nm
[11:13:00] <carlino3> shan are you suggesting to apply the formula directly to the top and left properties?
[11:13:16] <shan> yeah just fix the positions
[11:13:29] <shan> if you know the size of every element it'll be easy to accomplish
[11:13:34] <theskillwithin> fixed positions apply to the upper left corner of the element, not the center
[11:13:52] <shan> yeah
[11:14:00] <shan> same for absolute
[11:14:27] <theskillwithin> transform is a way to do it arbitrarily even if you don't know the size of it
[11:14:39] <carlino3> ^
[11:14:47] <carlino3> that is the problem
[11:15:04] <theskillwithin> thats just basic css, u have a much bigger problem
[11:15:31] <carlino3> for example, how would you position `<div class="user left">` in my example withot translate transform?
[11:15:39] <theskillwithin> the bigger problem being, u want to animate them
[11:15:40] <carlino3> what problem theskillwithin?
[11:16:23] <shan> position: absolute, top: calc(50% - var(--radius)), left: var(--margin) ?
[11:16:29] <carlino3> you mean that i will override `transform` and all will be screwed?
[11:16:43] <theskillwithin> id recommend one step at a time, make the game work first,  then worry about animating later
[11:17:08] <shan> i think i agree
[11:17:24] <carlino3> yes, for the moment the "animation" is just a transition on top and left oroperties, so the card appears to slide when you move it
[11:17:37] <shan> but also, you gotta make sure your code is actually maintainable enough for you to come back and fix it later
[11:17:46] <shan> ie, add in the anims
[11:17:50] <theskillwithin> you might need some js for the animation afterall,  i didn't know this was a game
[11:18:34] <shan> i mean it's pretty commonplace to define animation in CSS and then apply it with js

[12:39:53] <qswz> event handlers should never be async, ljharb would say

[12:40:43] <qswz> this can lead to problems with preventDefault yea

[12:42:56] <theskillwithin> this is madness...
[12:43:11] <mertyildiran> the `formRef.current.submit();` is visited I'm sure about that. `e.preventDefault();` is not preventing the newline character.
[12:43:12] <qswz> but if it's managed in another component, then your code might be fine

[14:10:22] <Koopz> no need for that if i could just straight up not use require() right?
[14:11:24] <Koopz> especially not if ESM doesn't support require()
[14:13:46] <Koopz> and ESM compatibility would be the best thing. Writing modules in a way that browsers directly support them, dev without any fancy cli tool serving your html
[14:15:04] <Koopz> though idk how one would go about "production" aka actually replacing those imports with a single <script src="bundle.js"> if there's any need
[14:21:13] <Koopz> so this project using gulp here for example... if i want to add any css rules i write them into my css file, then run gulp to get a fresh bundle and refresh the page in my browser
[14:23:43] <Koopz> now talking about it i could *theoretically* use a stupid PHP if checking ENV_VARs to see wether we're in a dev env or production and then either include the files directly or just the bundle, but that'd be too much work
[14:24:37] <Koopz> and then i possibly run into issues where i fucked up the order in which the js files were supposed to get loaded, don't have the issue in dev env because the bundling fucked it up

[17:29:36] <sheetjs> <td href="..."><a href="...">content</a></td> is not great
[17:29:43] <theskillwithin> idk seems pretty reasonable to me
[17:29:55] <theskillwithin> but then how would people put into practice
[17:30:13] <sheetjs> broadly speaking there are 3 situations
[17:30:21] <sheetjs> 1) generating the HTML from an Excel sheet
[17:30:32] <sheetjs> 2) generating an Excel sheet from HTML that you control
[17:30:40] <sheetjs> 3) generating an Excel sheet from HTML that you do not control
[17:31:00] <sheetjs> the first is easy since the library does the work
[17:31:22] <sheetjs> the second is something the developer can control, and the third is seeming out of control
[17:32:14] <sheetjs> in practice, lets say it were href attribute on the TD.  the writer would just write that attribute when generating the TD
[17:32:38] <sheetjs> the developer would have to add that attribute in when they generate the table (using react or angular or w/e)
[17:32:58] <sheetjs> and in the general case, it would fall back to some scanning for <a> tags
[17:33:13] <theskillwithin> next time to convince me don't start off with href on td lol

[17:36:10] <thykka> wth is `t` and `v`?
[17:36:33] <sheetjs> its a passthrough for marking cell types and values

[21:28:09] <austincheney> I have noticed two general categories of technical interviews:  1 bizarre algorithms that have nothing to do with the product, 2) rapid fire language trivia
[21:28:18] <FlorianBad> How can I turn a regexp substitution expression into a .replace() call in a way that is very universal?  So if I have for example  's/(\w).\d/xxx\1/ig'  as a string variable it will figure out how to grab from it the \1, the i and g options, etc.
[21:28:52] <qswz> 1. is good, evaluate how fast minded someone is
[21:28:53] <systemfault> Look at the RegExp constructor
[21:29:31] <austincheney> FlorianBad, what do you mean by universal?
[21:29:47] <qswz> I'd look in template engines maybe
[21:30:08] <austincheney> FlorianBad, do you mean a semi-global method that replaces using a regex?
[21:30:15] <FlorianBad> austincheney: I mean that I need to be able to provide a basic string like that and the regexp and flags will be build from it
[21:31:02] <qswz> FlorianBad: example inputs and outputs please
[21:31:36] <qswz> do you have markers for the placeholders, like 'I like {{name}} very much'
[21:32:06] <FlorianBad> qswz: there's only one input, the string I gave 's/..../..../ig' from there I need my javascript code to figure out how to turn it into a regexp and flags, etc.
[21:32:20] <FlorianBad> (well, the other input will be the string it is apply to, obviously)
[21:32:35] <qswz> ok
[21:32:37] <qswz> so plit it

[21:32:44] <austincheney> FlorianBad, you can easily create a regex from a string using:   const myTest = new RegExp("my expression here", "flags");  // where flags are things like g or i

[21:34:37] <austincheney> FlorianBad, just escape the slashes
[21:35:12] <austincheney> the global RegExp constructor will convert the string into a regex object including your switches and \1 and \2

[21:37:15] <qswz> of replacement
[21:37:17] <qswz> or*
[21:37:24] <qswz> yea
[21:38:41] <FlorianBad> So there is no way for Javascript to know what this means?   `s/xxxx/xxxx/g` ? The only solution will have to be to split it?

[22:13:03] <wroathe> systemfault: I assume you're talking about cocaine
[22:13:05] <systemfault> The world is too complex to not have "defaults"
[22:13:07] <ljharb> systemfault: that's an inflammatory accusation and if you keep up that specific kind of behavior you will be kicked, for what it's worth.
[22:13:15] <systemfault> ljharb: Your call.
[22:13:17] <ljharb> that complexity means there are no defaults
[22:13:21] <austincheney> sugar is more physically addictive than cocaine
[22:13:23] <ljharb> every individual has their own defaults
[22:13:36] <Rockwood> systemfault, why we are not going to make good friends :D
[22:13:51] <b-rex> that's not to say there still aren't sugars in it though. food companies in the united states at least have a controlling interest in the USDA & FDA, and thus decide what they put on the nutrition facts labels and ingredients lists.
[22:13:51] <ljharb> so you don't get to dictate what the defaults of others are. you can only guess what they might be for a population in aggregate
[22:13:53] <qswz> well, everyone are intrinsically attracted by different things
[22:13:54] <systemfault> No, the default for sugar is "sucrose" as in "table sugar"... the default for "salt" is sodium chloride.
[22:13:59] <ljharb> there is no "the" default.
[22:14:09] <ljharb> especially since the world is bigger than the US
[22:14:11] <b-rex> so there could still be sugar in this diet coke, it's just not required to be listed because they make their own rules
[22:14:17] <Rockwood> systemfault, really you like sugar?
[22:14:33] <Rockwood> me is really yes
[22:14:38] <qswz> !google define sugar
[22:15:10] <systemfault> ljharb: I don't live in the US...
[22:15:18] <Rockwood> qswz, you can't afford
[22:15:20] <austincheney> I find it preferrable to the user to provide a default to any given option only so that later effort, to make a selection, is eliminated until the user wishes to change the option
[22:15:32] <systemfault> austincheney: Stop making sense...
[22:15:38] <ljharb> systemfault: then you can probably make a claim about your own country i can't refute, but that can't be a universal claim.
[22:15:43] <qswz> sensible defaults
[22:15:44] <Rockwood> ljharb,  like lives in dreams :D
[22:16:06] <wroathe> That's for wimps. I prefer to bury my user under the sheer weight of configuration options.
[22:16:14] <ljharb> systemfault: i live in california, where standard table cane sugar is *in no way* the default.
[22:16:19] *** Joins: nomic (~nomic@185.217.117.156)
[22:16:22] <wroathe> They must see no fewer than 100 distinct form controls on a screen at all times, with no selected defaults.
[22:16:29] <systemfault> ljharb: cane sugar isn't the default, white sugar is.
[22:16:29] <ljharb> systemfault: which definitely doesn't say anything about other places, but it definitely disproves a universal default
[22:16:43] <ljharb> systemfault: that is also not the default here. if you ask a waiter for sugar they will ask you what kind
[22:16:51] <Rockwood> sorry but no one can stop me
[22:16:57] <systemfault> Read any recipe on the web, if they ask for sugar... it's plain white sugar
[22:17:06] <systemfault> It's not a US-only thing...
[22:17:09] <Rockwood> systemfault, whats?
[22:17:20] <ljharb> systemfault: no, it's any kind of sugar. they're all substituable.
[22:17:24] <Rockwood> systemfault, you like only
[22:17:35] <ljharb> systemfault: you can use coconut sugar in *every single recipe on the planet* in exchange for white sugar and it comes out identical
[22:17:40] <Rockwood> ljharb, can give you death
[22:17:44] <systemfault> ljharb: Most coffee shops have enveloppes for different types of sweeteners, including sugar.
[22:17:57] <ljharb> systemfault: and they don't say "sugar", they say "cane sugar". go read one.
[22:18:07] <Rockwood> systemfault, i don't those
[22:18:14] <ljharb> and yes, some of those sweeteners are also sugar. like "sugar in the raw" or "brown sugar".
[22:18:22] <ljharb> it's still sugar, even with the qualifier.
[22:18:31] <Rockwood> ljharb, good night
[22:18:42] <ljharb> so if your claim is now weakened to "sugar without an adjective means white table sugar" then fine, that's not worth disputing, but the original claim you made was stronger and still is wrong.
[22:18:44] <Rockwood> mu handle is down
[22:18:48] <Rockwood> my
[22:19:01] <Rockwood> good night

[22:20:27] <buu> Anyone have a simple boiler plate tos/privacy policy generator type thing for a gym website
[22:21:10] <buu> Also why are you arguing about sugar
[22:21:29] *** Quits: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Quit: The Time is Over)
[22:21:31] <qswz> dunno, the convo tured salty quickly
[22:22:31] <systemfault> qswz: What salt though?
[22:22:37] <qswz> :))
[22:22:47] <buu> My favorite sugar factoid is that tictacs say 0g of sugar despite being literally 100% made of sugar because you aren't required to list quantities less than 1g
[22:23:04] <qswz> haha
[22:23:24] <systemfault> buu: Yeah, the FDA says that if something has less than 0.5g per serving of sugar, it's sugar-free...
[22:23:42] <systemfault> That's why TicTac candies are basically sugar-free by that definition (IIRC)
[22:23:45] <qswz> buu: mine is that many honeys are completely made up from different sugars
[22:23:56] <qswz> 'cheap ones)
[22:24:06] <buu> qswz: You mean, like.. not honey?
[22:24:29] <systemfault> "Tic Tac® mints do contain sugar as listed in the ingredient statement. However, since the amount of sugar per serving (1 mint) is less than 0.5 grams, FDA labeling requirements permit the Nutrition Facts to state that there are 0 grams of sugar per serving."
[22:24:43] <qswz> buu: yea fully artifical honey
[22:24:56] <buu> I have never even heard of such a thing
[22:25:04] <buu> Truly we live in the worst timeline
[22:25:50] <buu> systemfault: On one hand it's a silly application of a rule, on the other hand, it probably doesn't actually matter to anyone
[22:26:20] <systemfault> I don't know... when I first tried dieting, I was looking at labels a lot.
[22:26:27] <buu> Although if you're diabetic and ate like 50 a day
[22:26:43] <austincheney> when I tried a low carb diet 4 years ago I lost 25 pounds in 3 months while eating much more, but I wasn't exercising and I was eating some really fatty meat.  I had more energy than before and felt less hyper, but it was really bad for my cardio
[22:26:45] <systemfault> Maybe that could have fooled me... but then, I don't eat candies..
[22:27:08] <buu> Yeah
[22:27:09] <austincheney> this year I have lost 20 pounds since Feb and would have lost much more, but running makes me hungry
[22:27:26] <systemfault> I started gaining back weight when gyms closed due to covid...
[22:27:45] <systemfault> Was too lazy to eat less...
[22:28:00] <buu> austincheney: I'm firmly of the belief that the best diet is one you can stick to
[22:28:12] <buu> If that's no bread or no cokes or no meat, whatever works
[22:28:23] <qswz> yea, austincheney that's a thing, you often want to eat after exercise, so it's better to exercise less often and more intensely maybe
[22:28:39] <buu> Exercising to lose weight is, yeah, super tricky
[22:28:41] <qswz> same thing for me
[22:28:47] <systemfault> Some foods are just easier to overeat though.. for me, it's bread/pastas
[22:28:48] <buu> Unless you're just a hardcore
[22:28:54] <qswz> easiest way is just eating less
[22:28:54] <buu> systemfault: tortillas
[22:29:04] <austincheney> my longer runs are pushing up my VO2 max.  today I hit 45 and didn't even feel tired.
[22:29:11] <systemfault> Anything made of flour basically... I overeat
[22:29:15] <buu> yup
[22:29:32] <qswz> just avoid all processed foods
[22:30:01] <qswz> except maybe safe stuff like tomato cans
[22:30:14] <buu> It's funny, in a way, like, a moderate sized snickers bar or something is 100-150 calories, and I eat one and I'm like, I'm done, but a single medium tortilla is like 110 calories and I could eat like 5 in a row
[22:30:16] <wroathe> You can't eat tomato cans, silly.
[22:30:29] <qswz> hah
[22:30:31] <buu> Define 'processed'
[22:30:32] <systemfault> wroathe: That's because you're not trying hard enough
[22:30:41] <wroathe> systemfault: oh shit
[22:30:45] <wroathe> challenge accepted, I guess
[22:30:49] <qswz> buu: prepared before packaging
[22:30:50] <systemfault> Oh god no.
[22:30:54] <qswz> like mix of stuff
[22:30:54] <systemfault> Don't do that
[22:31:00] <buu> qswz: so like, bread?
[22:31:03] <austincheney> canned veggies have drastically less nutrients and microbes than raw veggies and they need to be rinsed because of their salt content
[22:31:11] <qswz> yea bread
[22:31:18] <buu> harsh
[22:31:24] <qswz> haven't eat bread since many years
[22:31:28] <buu> austincheney: what about frozen
[22:31:42] <austincheney> buu, not sure
[22:31:50] <qswz> haven't eat any cooked food since a few weeks also
[22:31:56] <buu> what
[22:32:08] <buu> you are dead to me
[22:32:11] <qswz> yea, just fruits, vegetables
[22:32:13] <systemfault> I believe qswz is a fruitarian
[22:32:16] <systemfault> (Not sure)
[22:32:22] <systemfault> Ahh, veggies to
[22:32:23] <qswz> haha, shrimps recently
[22:32:25] <buu> definitely fruity
[22:32:27] <buu> =
[22:32:31] <qswz> nah, I'm no vegan
[22:32:52] <qswz> just mostly fruitarian
[22:32:55] <sheetjs> fruitarianism is hard
[22:33:01] <buu> Salt doesn't seem like a big deal, they're going back a lot on some of the over the top warnings
[22:33:18] <buu> kinda like fats
[22:33:18] <systemfault> buu: Yeah, it doesn't matter for most people...
[22:33:24] <sheetjs> some actor who portrayed steve jobs tried to do it and was sent to the hospital after a few weeks
[22:33:29] <systemfault> Only those who are at risk for heart attacks..
[22:33:29] <qswz> I'm often in lack of salts
