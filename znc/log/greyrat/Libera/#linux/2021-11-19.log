[04:43:55] <Belamos> Blondie101010, kdenlive is a video editing software.
[04:44:06] <Belamos> Blondie101010, my computer is too slow for 4K videos
[04:44:23] <Belamos> so, what I am doing is:  1) I use ffmpeg to create a 320 px wide video (really small)
[04:44:35] <Belamos> then I load this small video into kdenlive and cut it in pieces.
[04:44:50] <Belamos> and then I replace the 320 px video in kdenlive with its 4K version and then I render it
[04:45:21] <Belamos> I ran this command to check the amount of frames:

[04:46:50] <jkordani> Ok I need to amend my statement.  On both my dev machine and docker, libcurl3 and libcurl3-gnutls are installed.  When I build the software in docker, the gnutls version of the library is linked for runtime loading, whereas on my dev machine only libcurl3 is linked.
[04:46:56] <jkordani> how do I figure out what is going on here?
[04:46:57] <Arisc> xD
[04:47:22] <Belamos> knotMez, because when they are the same length and resolution,  and then replace it with the 4K file,  it will work

[06:01:13] <jkordani> [[R]]: this is the way.  libcurl.so on my dev machine is a link to  to libcurl.so, while libcurl.so in docker points to libcurl-gnutls.  Now the question is, since both packages are installed on both machines, what mechanism is used to "select" which one is in use
[06:01:15] <_xor> Wafficus: Because this is a node in a Proxmox cluster with other nodes that are running the same distro/config.
[06:01:16] <jkordani> grep -r
[06:01:25] <bambanxx> and the string?

[06:53:05] <jkordani> Ok, this uncovers a larger problem.  libcurl4-openssl-dev and libcurl4-gnutls-dev are mutually exclusive.  Which ever is installed at link time is the one that will be required at run time when the software is distributed.  If customers have the wrong package installed they will be prompted to remove it in favor of the dependency, and also
[06:53:05] <jkordani> prompted to remove "packages that are no longer required" as a result of its removal.  How can this be managed?

[12:33:53] <ordos> PaulFertser, you know it's funny, that's how this whole thing started. I was running Windows on this box, and I used this proprietary program called Asus Aura (or something along those lines) to fiddle with the RGB effects (and by fiddle I mean disable / make a static minimal lighting effect - not a fan of the rainbow explosions). Anyhow I've recently formatted the box and installed Linux on it, but now the RGB effects have reverted to default breathing
[12:33:53] <ordos> rainbows, and OpenRGB doesn't support my devices yet, so I'm trying to work it out on my end and hopefully contribute my device drivers to that project.
[12:34:03] <PaulFertser> ordos: btw, the LDD book is relatively outdated, you usually want to use the latest source code for the reference. Linux is constantly getting new APIs and if the code was recently submitted it usually means it was reviewed and is using the latest greatest functions.
[12:34:10] <ordos> But I'll make a note of using wireshark to help RE the whole thing. If it comes to it, I'll reinstall Windows again.

[16:04:22] <arseru> Hi! I have this command `aws codeartifact login --tool pip --domain XXXX --repository ${BITBUCKET_BRANCH}` but in some cases the envvar `BITBUCKET_BRANCH` should be taken from `BITBUCKET_PR_DESTINATION_BRANCH` if that envvar exists. Is there a way to tell the command "take the value from `BITBUCKET_PR_DESTINATION_BRANCH` but if that envvar isn't set, take it instead from `BITBUCKET_BRANCH`? Thanks for the help

Most mobo's will have an LED on them that lights up when that 5VSB is present. So, with the PC connected to the mains but not pressing the power button, you can check that LED is active.

[19:03:59] <xtp2830> TJ-: during grub phase, the card is already set to some gfx mode. if this is done in CSM (bios emulation mode), then switching to native gfx mode by loading i915 is somehow unstable. if booted in EFI mode, the card is used by EFI framebuffer which apparently initializes the card different.

[19:21:16] <kveroneau> That's not very eco-friendly if the entire board had to be replaced imo
[19:21:28] <PaulFertser> kveroneau: usually you can use a SO8/16 clip and reflash with a cheap external programmer.
[19:21:33] <TJ-> kveroneau: depends if they are soldered down; usually they will be for small size
[19:21:46] <Dagmar> It shoulnd't be possible to brick a board by overwriting EFI variables
[19:21:47] <kveroneau> At least there's some hope.
[19:22:03] <xtp2830> Dagmar: it was at that time
[19:22:04] * kveroneau agrees with Dagmar.
[19:22:08] <Dagmar> Make it unbootable until they're reset, yes, but brick it?  No
[19:22:13] <TJ-> Dagmar: not the variables; the code. They were stored in the same blocks
[19:22:26] <varaindemian> I am talking about the host

[23:21:11] <sjmulder> rangersmyth, Freenode had a sort of hostile takeover and it all went downhill, I'm surprised it's even still up

[23:35:41] <TJ-> gopher is making a come-back
[23:35:48] <TheGuestMovie> I got free cloud credits which let me create any VPS permutations with up to 4 CPU cores and 24GB RAM. So I can make four (4) 1-core 6GB VM, or a single 4-core 24GB VM, or whatever. it's better to just pick the single big VM, right, and use Docker if I want isolation within it? I don't know what I'll use it for, just random stuff.
[23:36:30] <ananke> TheGuestMovie: nobody can answer that for you, without further criteria
[23:36:35] <TikityTik> is it enough just to do alias gawk=gawk-4.2.1 for build tools to use this version of gawk for building?

[23:36:55] <kveroneau> TJ-, through #gemini ? or is the true RFC Gopher Protocol making a come-back?
[23:37:07] <ananke> TheGuestMovie: one thing is for sure: you'll burn through the credits much faster using one single VM that's up 24x7, as opposed to spinning up smaller instances as you need them

[23:42:00] <kveroneau> rangersmyth, I'd recommend using SPICE over VNC tbh
[23:42:09] <TheGuestMovie> I've never actually used either. I used VNC in the past, which works fine on a LAN, but pretty bad over the Internet. Now I use teamviewer (not open-source) since I got a license from work
[23:42:11] <TJ-> TheGuestMovie: that is the company that, in the USA, tried to copyright APIs and succeeded aside from fair use defences

[23:42:35] <TheGuestMovie> so you can punish them by taking their resources and not ever giving them money
[23:42:37] <kveroneau> On Debian you can just install xserver-xspice, and copy over the example qxl.xorg.conf file over top of xorg.conf, and start the display manager.

[23:43:11] <kveroneau> Although SPICE clients are currently limited to Linux clients, so a Windows user wouldn't be able to connect to the SPICE X11 session.
[23:43:21] <TheGuestMovie> TJ-: do you use anything Microsoft? cause people seem to have forgotten that they were financing the SCO lawsuit from the shadows

[23:44:06] <[[R]]> dont forgeta bout the sugar
[23:44:13] <kveroneau> After using SPICE over VNC, it's really difficult to go back to using VNC tbh
[23:44:14] <rangersmyth> @TheGuestMovie - They both look cool and from the little I read are easier to use and implement than VNC or teamviewer. Thanks for the tip, I might be able to use that to login to my linux laptop from my windows 10 desktop.

[23:45:21] <paulcarroty> Oracle "always free" can ban you in any moment. cool for testing/learning, no more.
[23:45:35] <paulcarroty> so you're warned
[23:45:39] <TheGuestMovie> rangersmyth: also, if you want to be able to have your own VPN connecting all your stuff easily, look at ZeroTier. It's free for less than 50 devices, and very simple to setup (via their web interface). It creates a secure tunnel between all your devices, and you dont need a server, it uses their public server for handshake at startup, and then
[23:45:39] <TheGuestMovie> port knocking for peer-to-peer connections.
[23:45:54] <TheGuestMovie> basically VPN without the headache
[23:46:01] <kveroneau> rangersmyth, under Linux, you can use the remmina client under GNOME to connect to SPICE display servers.
[23:46:14] *** Joins: voices- (~voices_@84.238.197.28)

[23:50:53] <kveroneau> rangersmyth, and if you decide to go with XSpice, you should also install the `spice-vdagent` agent on the server, this will make the remote connection feel more like a local VM, so better clipboard, and other fun extras.

[23:51:43] <kveroneau> But you will need to configure it in the xorg.conf, or the vdagent won't connect to it.
[23:52:29] <kveroneau> SPICE can also forward Audio, if that's of any interest to you.
[23:53:13] <rangersmyth> I made a Ubuntu server, also an account with cloudfare, and along with my own domain installed Guacamole for web desktop access, but I can't get it working at all, can't connect to my pc or laptop but I can connect to the digitalocean and to my ubuntu server. I am learning all of this, so thanks again for the guidence. This channel rocks

[23:56:30] <Skaface82> i run a windows qemu VM, which has a nvidia card passed through, and use the nvidia gamestream software for remote access.. it is by far the best remote desktop experience I have had.. you can even stream games over a remote connection

[23:57:35] <kveroneau> Skaface82, I've heard about that.  Never tried GPU passthrough yet.  I think they also had something called "Looking Glass" as well.
[23:57:38] <TheGuestMovie> paulcarroty: all I can find when searching HN for "oracle cloud banned" is a single comment 2 years ago

[23:58:19] <Skaface82> kveroneau: looking glass is for local only connections, I think it grabs the video ram buffer directly and displays it on the host system
[23:58:23] <rangersmyth> Thanks [[R]]
[23:58:55] <kveroneau> Skaface82, I believe that is correct.  The demos I saw were quite amazing.
