[23:31:30] *** Joins: besnn (~besnn@user/besnn)
[23:32:30] <ben_> Is it true that NetBSD has lua incorporated into its kernel?
[23:35:29] <tumn> ben_: lua and python have very little in common, the burden of proof is on you to find actual similarities between them - the only thing I can think of is that they're both dynamically typed interpreted scripting languages
[23:35:57] <tumn> everything else about them including their use case is drastically different
[23:36:39] *** Joins: strast (~Steve@c-64-246-115-105.amplex.net)
[23:37:15] <ben_> tumn: Great. I'm trying to get someone to explain why I should learn it.
[23:38:29] <tumn> their paradigm is different (python has classes, lua does not), in lua everything is treated as a first class object unlike in python, lua can be embedded into any ansi C application out of the box unlike python, python has plenty of libraries for hacking together scripts that automate complex tasks, whereas lua is minimal and cannot do complex
[23:38:29] <tumn> things on its own unless it's granted bindings by its host 
[23:39:15] <ben_> OK. Perfect. 
[23:39:38] <ben_> So Lua is imperative?
[23:40:09] <ben_> Can lua be embedded into FORTRAN?
[23:40:13] <tumn> python is often used in writing bots, doing scientific computing, machine learning, etc; lua is often used in game development, configuring other programs, and as a supplement to bigger C/C++ projects
[23:40:21] <Habbie> ben_, why do you need convincing?
[23:40:26] <tumn> lua is multi-paradigm, it can be used imperatively, functionally, procedurally
[23:40:40] <tumn> I've never heard of lua being embedded into FORTRAN but I don't think it's impossible
[23:40:46] <tumn> it is written in ansi C
[23:41:21] <ben_> Habbie Because I have a limited number of brain cells.
[23:42:03] <tumn> lua at its core is imperative (with functions)
[23:42:20] <ben_> tumn: OK. Could you show me a snippet that uses function composition?
[23:42:51] <Habbie> function h(x) return g(f(x)) end
[23:43:18] <tumn> that works
[23:43:23] <ben_> Habbie That's ugly as fuck.
[23:43:26] <Habbie> ok
[23:43:30] <Habbie> bye
[23:43:44] <tumn> yeah I'm not quite sure what you're getting at ben_
[23:44:05] <tumn> what do you want to use lua for?
[23:44:58] <ben_> tumn: Not sure yet. I sometimes use NOTION window manager...I might like to hack on that.
[23:45:22] <tumn> I recommend reading the lua reference manual
[23:45:30] <tumn> it's free, and extremely simple and comprehensive
[23:45:43] <tumn> it shouldn't take long to read cover to cover
[23:45:49] <tumn> lua is small
[23:46:03] <Elw3> Dont be helpful, he might come back.
[23:46:12] <tumn> not my problem
[23:46:30] <ben_> tumn: Considering that notation, I would probably stick to an imperative style.
[23:46:50] <tumn> that's completely fine
[23:47:06] <ben_> I've already dowloaded the manual.
[23:47:06] <tumn> but u won't be able to get away with not using functions in most scripts
[23:47:42] <ben_> tumn Using functions is not functional programming.
[23:47:57] <ben_> tumn: Of course I'd use functions.
[23:47:59] <tumn> uh.... no... I did not say it was
[23:48:22] <tumn> lua is not a pure functional language like haskell
[23:48:34] <tumn> it simply has functions as a major feature
[23:48:54] <tumn> as in procedures
[23:49:19] <ben_> tumn: The notation is just bad for function composition. But that's OK. Every syntax has it's strengths and weaknesses.
[23:49:29] <tumn> is there something u specifically need help writing or designing?

[23:49:54] <Habbie> ben_, i'm truly curious, what syntaxes are good for function composition?
[23:50:23] <ben_> Habbie Fully parenthesized syntax is the best.
[23:50:33] <Habbie> what does that look like?
[23:50:39] <tumn> lisp
[23:50:43] <tumn> very ugly
[23:50:59] <tumn> I'm happy lua is not lisp
[23:51:18] <ben_> tumn Grow up. 
[23:51:33] <Habbie> how about we all stop calling things ugly
[23:51:49] <Habbie> ben_, come on, you grow up, you started it
[23:51:51] <ben_> Habbie Ugly is ugly. 
[23:52:19] <tumn> ben_ would know, he sees ugly every day when he looks in the mirror
[23:52:39] <ben_> tumn Are you guys 13?
[23:52:52] <tumn> 12 actually
[23:53:10] <tumn> any more questions?
[23:54:46] <ben_> Yeah...you aren't the best representatives for Lua. I don't need help with anything. I just wanted to get your pitch for why I should learn Lua...what is really cool about it, etc.
[23:56:03] <tumn> we couldn't care less if you dislike lua and you are free to leave if you want to
[23:56:21] <tumn> I didnt realize we were meant to be lua's customer service and sales team
[23:56:30] <ben_> tumn: Wow, you're a jerk.
[23:56:34] <tumn> this is just a channel for discussing the language
[23:56:59] <ben_> tumn: That's what I'm trying to discuss...duh.
[23:57:51] <tumn> if you come out of the gate swinging calling lua ugly you're going to get negative reactions from people on #lua, pretty simple
[23:58:02] <tumn> unless you have some specific questions
[23:58:25] <tumn> I already went over lua's pros and cons
[23:58:29] <ben_> Like I said. Grow up.
[23:58:39] <ben_> I'm not going away.
[23:58:41] <tumn> so no specific questions then - got it
[23:59:13] <ben_> tumn What data structures does Lua support?
[23:59:19] <tumn> tables
[23:59:22] <tumn> that's all
[23:59:29] <tumn> they are mixed key/value pair dictionaries
[23:59:39] <tumn> that can simultaneously act as one-indexed arrays
[23:59:42] <ben_> That's cool.
[23:59:49] <tumn> dynamic size
[23:59:56] <ben_> I like that.
