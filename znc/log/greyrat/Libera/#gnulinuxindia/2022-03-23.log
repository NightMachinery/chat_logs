[12:32:32] <daksh[m]> s/etf/etc/
[12:35:37] <pystardust> you could also use the cleaner async await syntax http://0x0.st/oNg7.js
[12:36:05] <pystardust> this way error handling and everything would have normal syntax with out a lot of handlers
[12:38:02] <pystardust> relejek[m]: yeah, shell scrpting is easy but its syncronous, js is asyncronous which a webserver needs to be, it can't do one thing at a time else websites will be very slow, so it might seem harder to wrap your head around coroutines. 
[12:39:19] <pystardust> if you are familiar with python, then you could still write webapps using flask/django, (if you dont' wanna learn async programming) or you use the power of coroutines even in python with aiohttp and other async modules

[15:14:14] <labrador> I'm on irc so don't have history
[15:29:31] <hemish> hey so finally i foundd what i wanted, some months ago i asked if someone has the urge to use python as your shell
[15:29:34] <hemish> and this thing happened
[15:29:47] <hemish> so there is xonsh shell which can run both python and bash intermixed
[15:29:57] <hemish> and now i changed my shell to it
[15:30:11] <hemish> so basically u can use echo, cat, and also print and open
[15:30:18] <hemish> use python methods
[15:30:27] <hemish> and also call programs normally as we do in bash
[15:30:31] <hemish> use python type loops
[15:30:38] <hemish> can pipe also
[15:31:29] <hemish> also it has an rc file which you can use to preimport some modules or just use bashrc things in that

[22:15:24] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: nah m8, im just trying everything out. I wanna understand why people love things others hate, like for example people naively criticized python, JavaScript node apps and GUIs. Im liking all of them after trying them out. I have gotten a lot of ppl from my college into irc and other foss stuff, talking about cli filters out most ppl, do introducing a nice gui. Tho i still personally prefer cli
[22:17:04] <gtlsgamr> i really want to switch to a DE now so that my wife can use it too
[22:17:11] <labrador> pystardust, they do it to be edgy
[22:17:12] <labrador> Simple
[22:17:15] <gtlsgamr> but i am too *attached* to my dwm config
[22:17:35] <labrador> Most do not understand technology enough to have an opinion on its usefullness
[22:18:01] <labrador> Its hard to have that kind of knowledge to criticize a fundamental design flaw in software
[22:18:14] <gtlsgamr> labrador: typical /g/ behaviour! I stopped going there because of that. 
[22:41:12] *** Quits: labrador (~labrador@user/labrador) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:02:12] <pystardust> Technology and computers is overrated here, computers are not needed in most ppls life and if they just wanna use them for some basic tasks then its better to just get done with easy interfaces. In fact at this point i find that ppl who code for companies are doing such menial things, no one seems to care about the beauty of it, they just want to "get things done".
[23:08:46] <pystardust> Even with linux, people just look at ricing and hotkeys and nag about editors instead of the actual beauty of linux, like udev, unix socks, init (like systemd units), dev files
[23:13:21] <iamak[m]> To understand these things, people require OS knowledge
[23:13:31] <iamak[m]> I don't think many people have this (including me)
[23:13:33] <iamak[m]> ðŸ™‚
[23:24:55] <pystardust> Yeah but ppl spend so much time learning a new WM or configuring a editor. There is like no new thing learnt in the whole process other than maybe a lil bit of a new language. Instead try to look into other stuff one by one. Like do uk that all the hardware into is available in files, you could change monitor brightness by writing numbers into a file. And like wise for any property of any device. You could also detect 
[23:24:55] <pystardust> changes and trigger programs. Like you could write a udev rule saying that if my graphic tablet is detected then open xournal. You could learn unix programming in C! There is an amazing playlist course on advanced unix programing. And of course the whole networking and hacking scene, which is totally a new ball game.
[23:31:31] <iamak[m]> :hmm:
