[01:52:54] <drmpeg> Jacob and clever. I did some FFT blocks for the C66 DSP on the Beagleboard X15. https://github.com/drmpeg/gr-c66xfft
[01:53:25] <clever> drmpeg: i still need to figure out the math behind FFT first, before i can convert it to the pi's DSP
[01:55:48] <drmpeg> I just used a library on the C66. The code in gr-c66xfft is just the GNU Radio to OpenCL interface.
[01:56:17] <clever> ahh
[01:56:20] <drmpeg> FFTW was still 2X faster.
[01:56:34] <clever> my issue, is that the DSP core on the rpi, is a variant of a synopsys DSP
[01:56:40] <clever> and all of the docs/libraries are behind NDA
[01:56:55] <clever> so all i have is an RE'd assembler, and docs on what each opcode does
[01:57:04] <clever> i need to create the library myself, from scratch
[01:57:51] <drmpeg> Have fun. It's difficult to beat FFTW.
[01:58:05] <clever> what makes FFTW special?
[01:58:16] <Jacob[m]123> Yeah, 2x slower sounds about right.
[01:58:24] <drmpeg> It's fast.
[01:58:38] <Jacob[m]123> FFTW is special because it's the fastest FFT in the west
[01:58:50] <drmpeg> And uses SIMD.
[01:58:56] <Jacob[m]123> I'm in NM so it's super fast here
[01:59:12] <Jacob[m]123> And SIMD yea yea. And lots of other clever math
[01:59:36] <clever> in general, what can arm neon do? ive not investigated it much, since its so well documented, there is nothing i can add
[02:00:58] <drmpeg> You can definitely speed up an FFT with NEON.
[02:01:10] <clever> but how does it work, at an ISA level?
[02:02:01] <Jacob[m]123> http://www.vesperix.com/arm/fftw-arm/bench/gcc-a8-nofma/index.html
[02:02:43] <Jacob[m]123> Speed it up *a lot*
[02:03:35] <clever> i did discover the FMA stuff recently, on the rpi dsp, so that simplifies some operations
[02:05:56] <drmpeg> I have a NEON FFT here. https://www.w6rz.net/fft.c
[02:07:19] <clever> drmpeg: ah, that kinda helps, i can see the intrinsics, and roughly see what they do, and how an fft works
[02:08:25] <drmpeg> Yup. That code only does power of 2 FFT's.

[02:12:43] <clever> drmpeg: vmulq_f32, this is doing a vector = vector * vector, right? how wide is each vector?
[02:14:05] <drmpeg> 4 items.
[02:14:21] <clever> ah, so thats what the 4 in float32x4x2_t is
[02:14:46] <clever> that would imply the rpi's DSP is more powerful, since it always operates on 16 times
[02:15:28] <drmpeg> Maybe.
[02:16:26] <clever> but its also integer only
[02:17:30] <drmpeg> You might find this useful. https://github.com/mborgerding/kissfft
[02:18:00] <clever> the DSP i'm trying to target, is also entirely seperate from the 3d core on the chip
[02:18:09] <clever> which does already have its own fft examples
[02:21:26] <clever> drmpeg: https://elinux.org/images/4/40/Elc2011_anderson_arm.pdf page 5, says that neon registers are basically uint64_t[32], but can also be turned into uint128_t[16]
[02:22:34] <clever> while on the VPU DSP of the rpi, registers can be uint8_t[16], uint16_t[16], or uint32_t[16], and the width you pick, determines what other registers you overlap with (like AH vs AL in x86)
[02:22:54] <drmpeg> My example code was for armv7 (32-bit).
[02:23:20] <clever> the pdf i linked is for cortex-a9
[02:29:24] <drmpeg> Yeah, I'm far from a NEON expert. I have to Google each instruction every time.
[02:33:35] <clever> and the pdf i linked, has an uncopable link to the full intrinsics list
[02:34:34] <clever> uncopyable*
[02:35:17] <clever> which is just 404 now
[02:36:09] <clever> https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/ARM-C-Language-Extensions-_0028ACLE_0029.html#ARM-C-Language-Extensions-_0028ACLE_0029 maybe?
[02:37:25] <drmpeg> When I Google individual instructions, I end up here. https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0491/c/BABDEAGJ
[02:38:59] <clever> seeing a proper list of intrinsics, makes me re-think my plans of using c++ templates to dynamically generate the right opcode for the types
[02:39:35] <clever> the only downside i can see to that api, is that its very load/store heavy
[02:40:37] <clever> the rpi DSP can hold 128 seperate uint16_t[16]'s at once, so it favors bulk loading of many vectors, then doing bulk compute
[02:40:45] <drmpeg> I have a project that does that. https://github.com/drmpeg/gr-dvbs2rx
[02:41:17] <clever> but every intrinsics list i'm seeing, lacks any way to specify register numbers
[02:41:34] <clever> so i would have to ram->register, compute, register->ram, for each one, making them very costly
[02:42:21] <drmpeg> Original code is here. https://github.com/xdsopl/LDPC
[02:42:23] <clever> drmpeg: for reference, https://gist.github.com/cleverca22/79143cb23a50d572b9d527c9ea479492#file-vpu-support-native-h-L6
[02:42:30] <clever> this is what my intrinsics look like
[02:42:41] <clever> and i implemented each twice, in both asm and plain c
[02:42:54] <clever> so you could compile the code on x86, and it will perform the same computation

[04:08:00] <opcode> patchvonbraun[m]: well it depends on the application of course. For most domains you don't need manual memory management like malloc. For long running workflows the startup time of a VM is insignificant so it might be appropriate to use java or c#. If it must be OO and compiled, then perhaps Common Lisp.  If you don't need OO there's always Go
[04:08:31] <opcode> I hear Rust is the new hotness but I have never tried it so I don't really know anything about it
[04:09:22] <opcode> 95% of the time people think they need the performance of C or Fortan and they don't. Computers are so fast now that you can use much better languages than C. 
[04:09:47] <opcode> I mean look at what we can do with python
[04:10:11] <opcode> For clever's case it sounds like C is warranted/required
[04:10:20] <opcode> But like I said that's a specific application
[04:11:26] <clever> i believe gnu radio is also using a blend
[04:11:40] <clever> python to wire up the elements in the flow graph, but then c/asm to actually implement each node
[04:11:52] <willcode4[m]> I'd have no problem programming in any of a number of language, but you also have to consider the whole ecosystem. How may sets of libraries and environments do you want to learn, and which set of them that you can keep in your head all at once works for the most things you have to do?
[04:12:00] <clever> so you can ue the simplicity of python in the areas that arent performance critical
[04:12:49] <patchvonbraun[m]> opcode: yup. I’m aware of all that. Which is why I use Python for almost everything since around 2008. I’m thankful that GR already has basically all if the stuff I need for high speed processing. Although I did write some C the other day to do 40Msps VITA-49 network encap.
[04:14:19] <patchvonbraun[m]> willcode4: I had some Python/C cognitive interference when I first started with Python.
[04:17:29] <willcode4[m]> This is what keeps me from learning more about Rust (I read half the book and got tired). C/C++/Python do enough stuff, even though I think Rust might be "better" after you learn a hundred crates.
[04:18:11] <willcode4[m]> It also depends on whether you work mainly on one project.
[04:20:31] <clever> i just had an idea on how to further implement what i was thinking about
[04:20:48] <clever> what if the python code, was responsible for generating the asm on the fly, based on the flow graph
[04:21:02] <clever> i can definitely see that being a viable option
[04:21:08] <willcode4[m]> That's a compiler.
[04:21:29] <clever> willcode4[m]: no open source compiler supports the vector core i want to target
[04:21:52] <clever> the only thing i have to work with is a binutils fork that can assemble the vector opcodes
[04:23:17] <clever> i'm thinking, i pre-write some asm for a specific goal like FFT or FIR, but i leave the register#'s blank
[04:23:45] <clever> and then when you wire 2 objects together in the flow graph, and they are compatible, the python code can deal with register allocations, and joining the 2 operations
[04:25:01] <willcode4[m]> That's a compiler backend - you might want to look into LLVM.
[04:25:33] <clever> willcode4[m]: i have heard that llvm has support for this cpu core, but i dont know if it supports the vector opcodes, so the same problem may still exist
[04:27:16] <opcode> clever: what cpu/Isa are you targeting?
[04:27:34] <clever> opcode: VPU/vc4, which is a variant of a synopsys DSP
[04:27:49] <opcode> Cool :)
[04:28:05] <clever> every pi model has a dual core VPU, even the pi0/pi1
[04:28:30] <clever> each core has 32 scalar registers (r0 to r31), and an uint8_t[64][64] matrix registerfile
[04:29:05] <clever> the vector ops can select a row or column of 16 cells from the matrix
[04:29:15] <patchvonbraun[m]> willcode4: I got into software and systems development in 1979. Since then there has been a near constant barrage of “my programming language is better” and various things come into and out of fashion. For projects with very long lifetimes it’s important to resist “being fashionable”.
[04:29:46] <clever> flipping between row and column mode i think will make matrix mult far simpler, without having to do a rotation step, which i think arm-neon requires
[04:30:10] <clever> but also, gcc doesnt support that row/column stuff, and has a much more limited model, of just N vectors holding M ints each

[04:39:29] <clever> willcode4[m]: i'm using https://github.com/itszor/vc4-toolchain
[04:39:55] <clever> the confusing part, is that every rpi, supports 3 different ISA's, each running on a seperate cpu cluster

[04:40:22] <clever> qpu is where opengl shaders run, and thats what py-videocore6 is targeting
[04:40:29] <clever> vpu is the core i'm targetting
[04:43:46] <clever> the QPU generally has a higher latency as well, because of how jobs are scheduled in hardware, so it prefers doing larger jobs
[04:44:10] <clever> while the VPU is much more like arm+neon, so it can freely access anything in ram, and do much smaller jobs

[04:58:55] <willcode4[m]> That looks interesting. If you can make the VPU code "loosely coupled", i.e., act as a service or respond via a mailbox (with shared memory, dma, or whatever it has for high speed interchange), then any software you write for it can be independent of GR. Latency is not necessarily a problem depending on the applicate, so GLES could be fast. Is there some indication that the VPU will be much faster than the GPU? I see that it executes
[04:58:56] <willcode4[m]> video codecs, or may be both VPU and GPU do that for different codecs.
[05:00:30] <clever> https://github.com/ali1234/vcpoke/blob/master/main.c#L21-L53
[05:00:47] <clever> willcode4[m]: there is already a mailbox option to just execute a chunk of VPU asm at a defined physical address
[05:01:17] <clever> so you just need to convince the arm core to flush things first, and dont destroy too much VPU state, so the firmware can keep running when your done
[05:02:43] <willcode4[m]> Any benchmarks for relavent ops?
[05:03:17] <clever> willcode4[m]: the mult opcode takes 2 clock cycles (at 500mhz) to mult a pair of uint16_t[16] operands into an uint32_t[16] output
[05:03:29] <clever> i believe most others take 1 or 2, havent profiled too many yet
[05:04:08] <opcode> Lol every time you use the word opcode I get a push notification on my phone. Better nick choices have been made
[05:04:10] <clever> it has repeat options, so you can feed it an uint16_t[32][16] and just repeat the vector operation 32 times, fully automatic
[05:04:22] <clever> opcode: the same thing happens to be, but far less often
[05:04:30] <opcode> Haha
[05:05:05] <clever> willcode4[m]: its also able to issue scalar opcodes, while a vector opcode is running, so i could issue a REP32 mult, and then go do some scalar operations for the next 64 clock cycles
[05:05:20] <willcode4[m]> We'll be sure to complement ideas more here using the word "clever".
[05:05:44] <opcode> Time to make a programming language called Clever
[05:05:47] <willcode4[m]> So, it may or may not be faster than the other processors, but it's an additional resource to use in parallel?
[05:05:55] <clever> willcode4[m]: yeah
[05:06:17] <clever> it also has a trick up its sleve, to have less downtime stalling on bus IO
[05:06:30] <clever> the 2 VPU cores (each with its own regfile), share the vector computation core
[05:06:36] <clever> but load/stores dont use the core
[05:07:01] <clever> so with more control over the firmware, you can have the 2 cores taking turns, with 1 doing load/store, and the other doing compute, and then swap roles
[05:07:21] <clever> and then you dont have to subtract clock cycles for ram access
[05:09:29] <clever> willcode4[m]: when using the official/closed firmware, you dont know what else is using the vector code, so you may need to do a full save/load (4kb of state!!) to keep it intact, and you can only run one job at a time, with a lot of downtime between jobs (no real queue)
[05:10:05] <clever> willcode4[m]: but when using the open firmware, you know exactly what is using the vector opcodes (currently nothing, so you dont have to share), and you can add in a queue system, to pipeline things far better
[05:10:56] <willcode4[m]> This http://www.aholme.co.uk/GPU_FFT/Main.htm looks a whole lot easier - your way looks like more fun - enjoy!
[05:12:04] <clever> willcode4[m]: thats QPU based again, so it can be leveraged IN PARALLEL to what i'm trying to do!
[05:13:35] <willcode4[m]> Yep, understand. Had anyone used the QPU for GR hey?
[05:13:44] <willcode4[m]> Yet.

[05:15:27] <clever> willcode4[m]: this is a QPU compute shader, for doing a mandlebrot fractal
[05:17:10] <clever> the major difference, is that arm/vpu are scalar cores, with vector extensions
[05:17:17] <clever> so you can do either scalar or vector
[05:17:43] <clever> but the QPU is an exclusively vector core, so you can kinda just close your eyes, and treat it like a scalar core, then schedule 16 jobs
[05:20:15] <flash[m]> clever opcode :) (I feel your pain)
[05:20:26] <opcode> Hahaha
[05:22:44] <clever> flash[m]: i can rope you in too!, the pi4 has an SPI flash chip that can hold 512kb of data, and the pi4 boots from a .bin file held there
[05:22:56] <clever> and that code runs on the VPU
[05:23:38] <clever> so the chip can be running vector code in under 1 second from power-up, at the cost of having to supply your own drivers for everything (not even ram is online)
[05:24:01] <clever> the pi0-pi3 can also be configured to do the same, and then you can use your own spi chip, and dram drivers are open there

[16:23:01] <tonys[m]1> fyi - incase its helpful or highlights some minor issue. After more reading, and a LOT of parameter tuning whilst staring at spectrums and graphs I've managed to get 100% packet recovery from a 2FSK stream using the quad demod -> dec FIR filt -> clock recovery MM -> bin slicer. One alternative i've tried was using the GFSK demod block instead of that previous flow, however its recovery rate was far lower about 50% until I changed the last
[16:23:01] <tonys[m]1> parameter I was testing and it leapt up to 99%. It seemed a lot more sensitive to the omega relative limit compared to the longer flow which with same value I was using earlier still recovered 83%. Looking at the output it seems GFSK demod is missing several of the packets, and there are a few bit errors. I have the extra decimation and low pass in the first flow which i don't think the GFSK block uses, I'm not sure if the clock recovery is
[16:23:01] <tonys[m]1> different. This was with 3.9.2. In 3.9.3 CR MM has been deprecated but trying that made no difference.

[16:38:35] <tonys[m]1> also running my flows from a static source file of a capture the results were not deterministic when there is some error rate, and the differences could be quite high a times. Is this due to some inherent calculation or just the nature of GR and sampling rates?

[23:55:46] <bpadalino> yes, a mixer is involved .. and setting a tone to be offset from center is a good idea
[23:55:54] <bpadalino> otherwise the automatic IQ balancing will try to get rid of it
[23:57:22] <tom_chyze[m]> do you mind elaborating on that? is that in the firmware or in GRC?
[23:57:49] <tnt> Plenty of weird things happen at DC ... avoid it.
[23:58:36] <tnt> all due to various imperfection (ADC offset, LO leakage, 1/f noise, .... the list goes on).
[23:59:28] <tnt> some automatic process in the B210 tries to "fix" (really just make it "look nice" because whatever signal is there got obliterated already) it but if you signal is a tone, it'll get rid of it.
