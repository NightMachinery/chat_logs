[00:26:57] <manicennui> Are those some actual NFT images?
[00:27:03] <Brekkjern> Probably
[00:27:20] <manicennui> So the video itself also shows how fucking stupid NFTs are on another level.

[01:37:55] <manicennui> Is it different?
[01:38:05] <ngoldbaum> new‚Ä¶ notepad?
[01:38:08] <manicennui> They should replace it with vim.
[01:38:18] <ngoldbaum> what next? ms paint?
[01:38:38] <manicennui> It has dark mode.

[01:39:39] <manicennui> Hopefully they'll add some ML features to complicate it.
[01:39:59] <dimadima> i prefer to navigate by TripTik
[01:40:34] <manicennui> "To help you be more productive, we are introducing a redesigned find and replace experience and are also adding support for multi-level undo"
[01:40:43] <indigo> Value added Notepad
[01:40:46] <manicennui> And they gave it a UI update.
[01:40:52] <manicennui> Seems like they should stop there.
[01:41:08] <indigo> Gotta add dark mode
[01:41:09] <dimadima> heh "The book grew out of an article "The Future as a Way of Life" in Horizon magazine, Summer 1965 issue.[4][5][6][7]"
[01:41:29] <dimadima> i dunno
[01:41:47] <dimadima> i prefer things to be constantly changing
[01:41:53] <dimadima> one minute a button is over here
[01:41:56] <dimadima> next minute it's a toggle over there
[01:42:09] <manicennui> Literally while you are using the app it should change.
[01:42:11] <dimadima> this is a joke
[01:42:14] <dimadima> yeah
[01:42:31] <manicennui> We already have UI that moves all over as it loads, which leads to some super fun mistakes.
[01:42:33] <dimadima> i wish i had named my LLC "dada engineering"
[01:42:40] <dimadima> but alas, it is too alte now
[01:42:44] <dimadima> late*
[01:43:02] <dimadima> what ui is that manicennui
[01:43:04] <manicennui> You can add a DBA
[01:43:16] <manicennui> dimadima: Web for sure.
[01:43:22] <manicennui> And many mobile apps are basically web.
[01:43:32] <dimadima> how does it move all over?
[01:43:50] <dimadima> there are no classic apps left after notepad, right
[01:43:53] <dimadima> in windows
[01:43:55] <manicennui> Button you want to click is right there, then you go to click it and the rest of the page loads and pushes it down.
[01:44:06] <dimadima> oh in that sense
[01:44:07] <manicennui> dimadima: Paint, Calculator?
[01:44:12] <dimadima> i thought paint got redone
[01:44:17] <dimadima> a while back
[01:44:21] <dimadima> calculator? i dunno
[01:44:27] <manicennui> Oh, I didn't know what you meant by "left".
[01:44:33] <dimadima> remaining?
[01:44:48] <manicennui> You mean that haven't been refreshed/updated.
[01:44:58] <manicennui> Not "still in existence".
[01:45:25] <dimadima> yep
[01:45:36] <dimadima> notepad was the last one, right?
[01:45:59] <dimadima> paint on windows 3.11 was a different place and time
[01:46:32] <manicennui> I have no idea. I rarely use any of that stuff.
[01:46:39] <dimadima> üé∂ Heard you name the other day, it's been a long long time üé∂
[01:46:55] <dimadima> windows is dead to me though
[01:47:00] <manicennui> I use a browser and Battle.Net/Steam.
[01:47:23] <dimadima> do you run Windoze?
[01:47:33] <manicennui> For gaming, yes.
[01:47:36] <manicennui> Nothing else.
[01:47:44] <manicennui> I use the browser while waiting on something in a game.
[01:47:50] <dimadima> so linux otherwise?
[01:48:03] <manicennui> Nope. I use Macs because I'm evil.
[01:48:08] <dimadima> me too
[01:48:16] <manicennui> Linux on servers at work.
[01:48:27] <dimadima> gentoo?
[01:48:35] <bkero> only the best
[01:48:35] <manicennui> Ubuntu
[01:48:36] <dimadima> it's the fastest
[01:49:34] <dasm> recently i installed ubuntu on some underpowered server. it took me ages to get through snap and other things.
[01:49:59] <dasm> in the same time, debian was swift, in a matter of minutes it was done
[01:50:13] <manicennui> I don't really have problems with Ubuntu server.
[01:51:09] <indigo> I only use snap for certbot
[01:51:50] <dasm> snap crashes me firefox. i'm not happy with that
[01:52:34] <dimadima> indigo: certbot?
[01:52:39] <dimadima> i'm finding https://certbot.eff.org/
[01:52:39] <buttsbot> Certbot | Certbot
[01:52:45] <dimadima> but that doesn't make sense
[01:53:30] <dimadima> Being radical students, they decided against further graduate work and moved to the Midwest, where they married on April 29, 1950.[7]
[01:53:45] <dimadima> when moving to the midwest was radical lol
[01:53:58] <dimadima> burn your bra and move to columbus
[01:53:59] <manicennui> Were they from the East Coast?
[01:54:07] <dimadima> i guess
[01:54:14] <dimadima> Alvin Toffler was born on October 4, 1928, in New York City, and raised in Brooklyn.
[01:54:21] <dimadima> not sure about his wife
[01:55:06] <manicennui> They should have removed the keyboard interface from Notepad and relied on voice.
[01:55:23] <dimadima> hehe
[01:55:39] <dimadima> they should hire you at microsoft

[01:56:33] <dimadima> sigh
[01:56:40] <manicennui> Idle for too long? Windows starts talking to you.
[01:57:10] <dimadima> that's like a toy my child has
[01:57:24] <dimadima> it's a train engine that plays twinkle twinkle little start
[01:57:37] <dimadima> if you don't mess with it for a bit it does a little "choo"
[01:57:39] <manicennui> Basically make Windows into a responsibility that you can't neglect.
[01:57:47] <manicennui> You must give it constant attention or it does bad things.
[01:57:48] <dimadima> lol that's technology
[01:58:03] <dimadima> we are mere stewards of our devices
[01:58:04] <indigo> dimadima: Yeah, certbot auto-renews my let's encrypt certificates for my VPS
[01:58:15] <dimadima> indigo: that makes a lot more sense. why the snap?
[01:58:15] <indigo> Which is how I get SSL for my lounge instance
[01:58:22] <indigo> They distribute it using snap
[01:58:29] <dimadima> evil
[01:58:44] <indigo> I think they just don't want to maintain a yum repo/apt repo/pacman repo/etc
[01:58:55] <dimadima> :)
[01:59:07] <manicennui> Obviously the AUR is all that matters.
[01:59:21] <manicennui> No one else deserves security.
[02:00:01] <indigo> I think they also want to make sure you are always running the latest version
[02:00:10] <indigo> Maybe they don't trust backporting security updates
[02:00:17] <dimadima> i had a cert renwal issue the other day
[02:00:19] <dimadima> it was really sad
[02:00:26] <dimadima> cert didn't renew, to be precise
[02:00:37] <manicennui> I'm glad I don't deal with that stuff.
[02:00:38] <dimadima> i had to change the k8s secret name and restart the service to quickly hack it
[02:00:48] <dimadima> the certbot equivalent
[02:00:54] <dimadima> manicennui: i've never had it not renew
[02:01:00] <dimadima> running for several years
[02:01:16] <dimadima> haven't had time to investigate but watching my warning emails from LE now more carefully
[02:02:43] <dimadima> 20 ppl on an eng team
[02:02:45] <dimadima> what's everyone up to
[02:03:48] <manicennui> Are you asking me what the 20 engineers do?
[02:04:49] <dimadima> yeah but not, like, in great detail

[05:14:08] <jlindgren> sometimes i wonder if AoC severely hinders work in December - i know at my workplace 4 people on my 7 person team are doing the challenges. but then again most people are on PTO so much between teams nothing gets done anyway
[05:14:14] <jlindgren> its nice to have some fun problems to do in the mean time
[05:14:56] <prussian> It hinders mine

[05:34:39] <skyl4rk> right now I'm in a fistfight with openssl about something where I'm not sure about what the problem actually is
[05:35:24] <gwozniak> I had a similar incident with xsltproc today.  Turns out it wasn't xsltproc at all, but the IDE I had to use
[05:35:45] <gwozniak> That was a fun waste of an hour
[05:37:04] <gwozniak> On the upside, I learned that the contents of some parts of an XML file used to configure a project are functionally useless so I needn't worry about them

[16:18:20] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[16:18:41] <Brekkjern> v.v.v
[16:18:41] <buttsbot> ‚àà)‚úπ(‚àã
[16:20:15] <river> why do people even want tags
[16:20:59] <Brekkjern> Because without them this is just HN without any moderation
[16:21:11] <Brekkjern> With tags it's at least HN with tags and no moderation :P
[16:21:16] <river> lol
[16:25:38] <ngoldbaum> push also needs to add new mode
[16:25:40] <ngoldbaum> mods
[16:26:03] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[16:26:13] <river> problem is nobody can be trusted
[16:26:21] <ngoldbaum> unfortunately running a site like lobste.rs in your spare time isn‚Äôt tenable long term
[16:26:22] <river> anybody who wants to be a mod is out, for one
[16:26:47] <river> asking random people from the community seems to be a faux pas
[16:28:05] <Brekkjern> I mean... That is kind of his own doing too
[16:28:38] <river> i think that honestly push is keeping the site going really well
[16:28:39] <Brekkjern> Since everything else than computing is off topic in any spaces he and the community occupies, he has no way to evaluate the users character
[16:28:42] <river> i only have a few complaints
[16:28:43] <ngoldbaum> river: i mean, he did that
[16:28:48] <ngoldbaum> asking random people
[16:28:51] <ngoldbaum> it didn‚Äôt go well
[16:28:53] <river> ah...
[16:29:05] <Brekkjern> The thread became a proper shitstorm :P
[16:29:08] <ngoldbaum> lol angersock in that thread
[16:29:11] <river> lol
[16:29:12] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[16:29:17] <Brekkjern> It was kinda hilarious
[16:29:35] <river> I would have offered to help tbh but the barrier was insanely high
[16:29:47] <river> like you need years of experience as a mod etc.
[16:30:22] <Brekkjern> Shouldn't really
[16:30:56] <Brekkjern> But push seems deadly afraid of actually having opinions on how the site should run
[16:31:06] <Brekkjern> deathly afraid?
[16:31:07] <ngoldbaum> lol armin https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/1468565439039090690
[16:31:08] <buttsbot> Twitter - mitsuhiko - @llanga @dabeaz This wouldn‚Äôt have happened with Python 2 *sigh*
[16:31:10] <Brekkjern> How is that expression again?
[16:31:17] <ngoldbaum> the perfect troll in that context
[16:31:42] <ngoldbaum> deathly afraid
[16:31:53] <Brekkjern> Right
[16:32:17] <ngoldbaum> i think he‚Äôs just like super conservative in making decisions to the point of paralysis
[16:32:27] <Brekkjern> That is kinda my point
[16:32:41] <ngoldbaum> but also that doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt do haphazard things sometimes out of frustration
[16:32:59] <Brekkjern> Of course, but that just means his moderation becomes bipolar
[16:33:13] <ngoldbaum> it is! and it‚Äôs kinda inconsistent too
[16:33:14] <Brekkjern> Either he does nothing at all when he probably should, or he overreacts immensely
[16:33:31] <ngoldbaum> it would help to have more mods to catch things when push isn‚Äôt looking
[16:33:37] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[16:33:55] <Brekkjern> And probably stop shit that will just become a shitstorm later
[16:33:59] <ngoldbaum> he also likes to come up with technical solutions to social problems
[16:34:05] <ngoldbaum> like he naughty banner
[16:34:07] <Brekkjern> That too
[16:34:18] <ngoldbaum> which cost the site burnsushi among others probably
[16:34:54] <ngoldbaum> but instead of fixing any of that we just bitch in here about it
[16:35:22] <ngoldbaum> should start our own lobste.rs with boo.ze and hooke.rs
[16:35:53] <Brekkjern> Well, the only way to "fix" anything like this is to learn Ruby, make a PR, post a meta thread, deal with all the backlash, and have the PR stagnate.
[16:36:25] <river> oof
[16:36:41] <epilys> <river> why do people even want tags <- wow hurtful /s
[16:37:05] <Brekkjern> Well, I don't disagree considering how underdeveloped the tag system is on the site
[16:37:16] <epilys> that's why I rewrote lobsters in python, so I didn't have to learn ruby
[16:37:24] <Brekkjern> I want way more tags and the possibility of using more advanced filters
[16:37:31] <Brekkjern> epilys: lol
[16:37:51] * epilys resists the urge to talk about their project more
[16:37:56] <Brekkjern> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[16:37:58] <Brekkjern> Why not?
[16:38:06] <epilys> maybe it's spammy
[16:38:10] <epilys> it has advanced tag filters tho
[16:38:20] <Brekkjern> Just don't go full andyc and you're probably fine :P
[16:38:59] <epilys> https://sic.pm/
[16:39:06] <buttsbot> sic
[16:39:17] <epilys> tag filters are actually implemented as SQL clauses, it's pretty cool
[16:39:56] <Brekkjern> TTFB is a bit slow. Got nearly 900ms wait for the response
[16:40:18] <ngoldbaum> one advantage jcs had starting lobste.rs is that he and his friends were apparently at the center of a pretty rich vein of interesting tech people
[16:40:32] <ngoldbaum> lobste.rs did well as an invite only site mostly because of that
[16:40:41] <epilys> Brekkjern, it's because it's wsgi and not gunicorn os whatever it's called
[16:40:58] <ngoldbaum> but then eternal september happened and most of the early users are gone by now
[16:41:01] <epilys> sic.pm is registration open, but to participate you need to be "invited" (vouched by someone else)
[16:41:10] <drakonis> hmmm
[16:41:23] <river> what drove people away?
[16:41:25] <drakonis> looks neat
[16:41:34] <ngoldbaum> river: dumbassitude
[16:41:39] <river> hehe
[16:41:40] <epilys> and people can request for vouch/invites if they post a text about themselves
[16:41:44] <drakonis> invites when
[16:41:49] <ngoldbaum> compare threads on lobste.re in like 2014 vs today
[16:42:08] <epilys> drakonis, just sign up, it's open
[16:42:24] <river> I really liked laarc.io but it died,
[16:42:40] <drakonis> i see
[16:42:50] <epilys> river, what was it?
[16:42:57] <river> hn clone
[16:43:10] <ngoldbaum> loool actually running arc
[16:43:14] <ngoldbaum> y tho
[16:43:23] <drakonis> well, this is a pretty great lobsters rewrite
[16:43:25] <river> it's actually using hte continuation based web server stuff
[16:43:34] <river> serializable closures, wild
[16:43:40] <drakonis> its using racket features then?
[16:43:48] <ngoldbaum> arc is a lisp yeah
[16:43:49] <river> i cant believe pg wrote about this and loads of people were like "Wow this is a good idea"
[16:43:55] <epilys> gross
[16:43:58] <epilys> pg made me hate lisp tbh
[16:43:59] <ngoldbaum> drakonis: HN is also written in arc
[16:44:03] <drakonis> yes i know
[16:44:13] <drakonis> pg doesnt like common lisp
[16:44:35] <ngoldbaum> sic.pm also looks pretty dead
[16:44:41] <ngoldbaum> network effects are hard
[16:44:45] <drakonis> or idk
[16:44:50] <epilys> ngoldbaum, it's relatively new
[16:45:00] <epilys> maybe sign up and contribute?
[16:45:02] <epilys> :p
[16:45:20] <drakonis> pg is a wanker but the pg that wrote on lisp back then is not the one that got rich off ycombinator
[16:45:27] <ngoldbaum> eh, i‚Äôd rather people read what i say :p
[16:45:55] <epilys> ngoldbaum, that's mean
[16:46:07] <epilys> sign up and then invite people you know => problem solved
[16:46:24] <epilys> https://sic.pm/about/statistics/
[16:46:25] <buttsbot> statistics - about sic
[16:46:29] <drakonis> isnt that how you get communities started
[16:46:33] <epilys> yeap
[16:46:47] <drakonis> pg is a wanker
[16:46:50] <epilys> i'm specifically targetting ngoldbaum right now but everyone else is welcome too
[16:46:58] <drakonis> hah
[16:47:03] <river> cool charts
[16:47:15] <river> reminder that sic.pm has blackjack and hookers
[16:47:30] <epilys> the invitation tree looks like a flower because I am the center and have invited/vouched most of others
[16:48:13] <drakonis> am i vouched for yet
[16:48:18] <drakonis> i can't get the activation to work lol
[16:48:28] <epilys> drakonis, are you a bot perchance?
[16:48:34] <drakonis> god no
[16:48:35] <ngoldbaum> like i said, jcs was lucky in some sense that lobste.rs found traction just among him and his friends
[16:48:35] <drakonis> beep boop
[16:49:19] <drakonis> jcs had all of his openbsd friends
[16:49:36] <drakonis> most of which arent even posting anymore
[16:49:50] <epilys> they stopped but their meanness remained
[16:49:55] <epilys> in spirit
[16:49:55] <river> i said this before but i hardly even check lobsters much anymore, most of the links are boring now
[16:50:00] <river> idk if that's me or the site that changed
[16:50:08] <drakonis> the culture has shifted
[16:50:20] <epilys> drakonis, vouched
[16:50:25] <river> also I posted an interesting math thing and it was deleted, so i'm keen to find a site that accepts math
[16:50:35] <epilys> river, ahem...
[16:50:36] <drakonis> a thing lobsters lacks is the ability to deal with long running or recurring threads
[16:50:48] <river> which is kinda weird because push posted feymans textbook which is pure physics
[16:50:52] <ngoldbaum> pushcx needing to constantly delete crypto crap is a symptom
[16:51:08] <river> yeah that's another thing that's important to me, no bitcoin crap
[16:51:16] <epilys> drakonis, sic.pm shows all repost discussions as links below the discussion
[16:51:38] <epilys> sic.pm doesn't allow cryptocurrency stuff; I'm telling you it's the best thing after sliced bread /s
[16:51:40] <drakonis> oh no, i mean something like a weekly thread chain
[16:51:55] <drakonis> or god forbid, a thread that doesnt die off with time
[16:52:06] <Brekkjern> IMO one should just relent to the crypto-shit and make a tag for it, and just have that tag be filtered by default
[16:52:15] <drakonis> longform posting best posting
[16:52:18] <Brekkjern> That way the people who are interested can circlejerk on their own
[16:52:20] <epilys> Brekkjern, what? no
[16:52:29] <epilys> that's giving it credibility
[16:52:34] <drakonis> its going to leak into other threads
[16:52:34] <river> weeklys kind of suck
[16:52:40] <river> I dont like this "what u doing this weekend"
[16:52:40] <Brekkjern> No, it's essentially shadowbanning it
[16:52:42] <river> repeater
[16:52:45] <drakonis> ha
[16:52:51] <drakonis> i'd rather have long form thread discussions
[16:53:03] <drakonis> for things that aren't topical like links
[16:53:16] <drakonis> also weekly threads like devlogs
[16:53:23] <river> Brekkjern: I disagree, I dont think that we should give in just because there's a lot of them and they're persistent
[16:53:58] <drakonis> ah, there's an irc channel for sic
[16:54:11] <drakonis> its not large enough to justify having a offtopic channel like lobsters
[16:54:24] <prussian> make certain tags "opt-in" there.
[16:54:32] <prussian> shadow banned in practice.
[16:55:00] <Brekkjern> That is my point. I don't think there is any point of making a platform and trying to police what is on topic or not
[16:55:11] <epilys> #pyramidschemes is opt-in
[16:55:20] <Brekkjern> Ensuring it's easy to only see the stuff you want to see is probably a much better solution
[16:55:29] <drakonis> river: basically, i want to track a thread chain so i can follow someone's devlog without delving into their thread history
[16:55:30] <Brekkjern> Especially since you can outsource the tag moderation to the community
[16:56:06] <drakonis> epilys: does searching have more than 5 pages?
[16:56:06] <river> Brekkjern: totally don't get it - what is the point of a community with no focus or moderation?
[16:56:14] <river> it'll just become the lowest common denominator
[16:56:37] <drakonis> and is there a lisp/common lisp/scheme tag?
[16:56:41] <Brekkjern> That happens no matter what you try to do
[16:56:52] <epilys> drakonis, probably aren't more than 5 pages of posts? it's young
[16:57:07] <river> ;-;
[16:57:09] <drakonis> i meant that if i search for someone's posting history, does it show more than 5 pages?
[16:57:13] <drakonis> because this is so annoying about lobsters
[16:57:18] <Brekkjern> People are complaining about Lobste.rs becoming the lowest common denominator now, and that site has had "active" moderation and an invite tree.
[16:57:19] <epilys> yeah it shows it all
[16:57:23] <drakonis> i'm searching something and i can read a very limited amount of comments
[16:57:37] <drakonis> invites have been given out very liberally to people
[16:57:48] <drakonis> the bar got so low
[16:58:16] <Brekkjern> Since there isn't one gatekeeper (or a council of gatekeepers) to the site, the decision that someone fits in the community is made by the lowest common denominator anyways
[16:58:44] <prussian> clearly we need a DAO and some kind of blockchain tokenization for lobste.rs
[16:58:47] <prussian> fund it
[16:58:50] <Brekkjern> lolyes
[16:58:56] <epilys> feels like we're ignoring the main problem of cryptocurrency: it's a scam so why accept it in a community?
[16:58:59] <river> invites are NFSs
[16:59:01] <river> invites are NFTs
[16:59:05] <prussian> this
[16:59:08] <prussian> fund it
[16:59:23] <drakonis> cryptocurrencies suck
[16:59:25] <drakonis> also yospos rules
[16:59:35] <epilys> i'm mining tokens for my new venture, pm me for getting rich quick
[17:00:06] <prussian> but what are the tokenomics?
[17:00:33] <prussian> clearly we need an irc channel for this to organize our "advertising"
[17:00:35] <epilys> that term is offensive to me as a PoC (person of crypto)
[17:00:38] <drakonis> tell you what
[17:00:45] <Xe> this sentence makes you breathe manually
[17:00:47] <drakonis> lobsters has a bunch of technical limitations
[17:01:00] <drakonis> this sentences makes you lose the game
[17:01:07] <prussian> i just lost
[17:01:08] <prussian> wtf
[17:01:10] <epilys> I'lve looked at lobsters code and frankly it's not readable
[17:01:16] <drakonis> its rails
[17:01:20] <drakonis> its not supposed to be readable
[17:01:21] <ngoldbaum> so does this one: Clawcoin.
[17:01:25] <Xe> epilys: rails usually ends up like that yeah
[17:01:32] <epilys> ngoldbaum, Clawin
[17:01:39] <drakonis> phoenix would likely be still more readable than rails
[17:01:58] <drakonis> since it foregoes all the magic
[17:02:25] <ngoldbaum> careful, dhh might fire you
[17:02:30] <epilys> it's not the magic per se, python for example is filled with it. the problem is the syntax doesn't tell you what's happening
[17:03:03] <Brekkjern> https://i.imgur.com/D0j2Ae7.jpg
[17:03:42] <river> thanks for that
[17:03:52] <drakonis> rails is incredibly impenetrable and does too much unexplained shit
[17:03:55] <Brekkjern> You're welcome, river :P
[17:04:03] <drakonis> Brekkjern: thanks i hate it
[17:04:06] <skyl4rk> should be wizdom then harrumph
[17:04:08] <river> :)
[17:04:13] <epilys> Speaking of wizards https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/002/238/755/509.png
[17:04:13] <Xe> drakonis: i have a joke for you, are you ready
[17:04:23] <drakonis> pour it into me
[17:04:25] <Xe> it's software
[17:04:37] <skyl4rk> i put on my robe and wizard hat
[17:05:01] <drakonis> hmm i feel like posting some links to sic
[17:05:07] <drakonis> time to make it into a cool place???
[17:05:15] <drakonis> maybe???
[17:05:22] <epilys> things are now in motion that cannot be undone
[17:05:32] <drakonis> the aggregation thing is good imo
[17:05:50] <drakonis> because it gets rid of the eventual fragmentation of the website into subgroups
[17:05:55] <drakonis> there's uhh
[17:05:57] <drakonis> tildes i think?
[17:06:04] <drakonis> https://tildes.net
[17:06:04] <buttsbot> Tildes
[17:06:04] <epilys> only speak with wizard quotes please https://c.tenor.com/MFvlRyhalGQAAAAC/gandalf-things.gif
[17:06:12] <drakonis> this is basically reddit done again?
[17:06:24] <ngoldbaum> fool of a took
[17:06:50] <Xe> drakonis: i've been thinking about making a lobsters-like kind of site targeted at LGBTQ+ in tech
[17:07:00] <epilys> sic.pm prevents this fragmentation by letting the fragments be personal, you choose what bucket of tags you are in
[17:07:02] <Xe> except not in rails
[17:07:09] <drakonis> rails....
[17:07:10] <epilys> Xe, fork mine
[17:07:15] <Brekkjern> drakonis: Yeah. The point of tags is that a post shouldn't be constrained to a single "tag", but rather many. And since you'd use tags to filter out things you don't want to see, you'd see everything unless you have already filtered it out.
[17:07:16] <drakonis> i guess you could say it went off the rails!
[17:07:28] <Xe> i was looking at Rocket and Diesel
[17:07:33] <drakonis> ah rust
[17:07:44] <epilys> Xe, that's how I started with sic, but it was too bad an experience
[17:07:55] *** Joins: reneeontheweb (~reneeonth@2601:246:900:bba0:912d:166f:3268:2029)
[17:07:58] <epilys> Rocket + diesel specifically
[17:08:11] <Brekkjern> epilys: But now that you have made it, RIIR?
[17:08:23] <ngoldbaum> wasm rust link aggregator time
[17:08:29] <drakonis> doing web things in rust is like doing web things in c/c++
[17:08:33] <epilys> sic.pm is javascript free
[17:08:47] <drakonis> try doing it with phoenix and liveview next
[17:09:04] <epilys> it has some rust->wasm helpers in the posting form but it's additive instead of a requirement
[17:09:07] <drakonis> the most javascript it has is for repaining stuff
[17:09:37] <Xe> i was going to do some limited additions to things with javascript, specifically for previewing posts
[17:09:39] <Xe> it would be done with Xeact
[17:09:58] <drakonis> what's the deal with tade.link?
[17:10:10] <epilys> Xe, make it gracefuly degrade for noscript users though
[17:10:12] <skyl4rk> could have two tastes per user, filter-out and filter-in
[17:10:15] <Brekkjern> It feels kinda weird to hope that I have covid...
[17:10:26] <epilys> drakonis, France (the state) banned sic.pm (the domain)
[17:10:29] <epilys> and we moved to tade.link
[17:10:31] <drakonis> oh
[17:10:32] <drakonis> huh
[17:10:35] <epilys> but now we declared peace
[17:11:09] <epilys> I was going to invade France for this casus belli but fortunately the horrors of war are not necessary now
[17:11:26] <drakonis> jolly good
[17:11:27] <epilys> (tldr for some reason the french tld authority dns stopped resolving sic.pm)
[17:12:03] <drakonis> hm, so the tag setup makes it a bit easier to follow project dev logs, right?
[17:12:31] <epilys> I guess
[17:12:43] <epilys> you can make an aggregation that only allows one user and specific tags
[17:12:49] <ngoldbaum> is pm one of those french TLDs you need to be an EU citizen to register?
[17:13:02] <drakonis> hmm, i see
[17:13:03] <epilys> ngoldbaum, no, it's just french
[17:13:08] <drakonis> is it gandi?
[17:13:11] <epilys> njal.la
[17:13:15] <ngoldbaum> and people said the french empire was dead
[17:13:48] <epilys> their colonialist hand reached our humble link aggregator community
[17:14:34] <ngoldbaum> lol there‚Äôs a section in the wikipedia article  for .pm about brexit
[17:14:47] <ngoldbaum> come on english people get over yourselves
[17:15:39] <epilys> oh so you need to be in EU/economic area after all

[17:52:43] <ewintr> epilys sic.pm looks nice. I just subscribed to the rss. That is the first step for me for any community.
[17:53:05] <epilys> ewintr, :) thank you
[18:15:30] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: apparently "the sun never sets over France" is more true than for the UK now
[18:17:02] <prussian> ironic

[18:55:38] <epilys> https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-provide-update-omicron-variant
[18:55:38] <buttsbot> Pfizer and BioNTech Provide Update on Omicron Variant | Pfizer
[18:55:49] <epilys> third shot necessary for pfizer folks
[19:06:57] <prussian> ugh
[19:08:15] <imode> cooooooool.
[19:09:07] <river> do we know much about omicron yet
[19:10:19] <ngoldbaum> OG covid antibodies aren‚Äôt as effective at neutralizing
[19:10:25] <ngoldbaum> so need high titers
[19:10:27] <ngoldbaum> get a booster
[19:11:55] <prussian> -_-
[19:12:30] <prussian> does it matter which "booster" I get?
[19:12:40] <river> ive been feeling pretty safe on public transport and stuff
[19:12:49] <imode> I'm wondering the same, prussian.
[19:12:52] <river> but im getting  alittle worried now
[19:13:04] <companion_cube> a lot of people seem to get moderna
[19:13:06] <imode> I can get it at the end of december, but I don't know whether I'm getting moderna or pfizer as a booster.
[19:13:10] <imode> I'm Pfizer 2x.
[19:13:15] <prussian> ^
[19:13:16] <prussian> same
[19:14:03] <Xe> same
[19:14:12] <Xe> i'll find out when i do
[19:14:24] <Xe> just gotta wait for quebec to open up vaccination stuff
[19:14:29] <prussian> fuck it. pfizer/biontech it is.
[19:14:31] <prussian> yolo
[19:15:26] <epilys> get whatever you can asap
[19:16:07] <epilys> unless you can quarantine yourself completely until you get the "best" booster, you're putting yourself in unnecessary danger by waiting for a specific one
[19:18:49] <ngoldbaum> prussian: consensus seems to be that moderna is best and pfizer is close
[19:19:05] <prussian> i see.
[19:19:11] <ngoldbaum> pfizer will likely be easier to find
[19:19:32] <prussian> oh cool... there is an appointment available at 11am today 35 minutes away from me.
[19:19:33] <prussian> lmao
[19:20:05] <ngoldbaum> nonzero chance of feeling pretty sick the next day though so be prepared for that
[19:21:01] <river> so we just get the same vaccine as before?
[19:21:11] <epilys> doesn't have to be the same
[19:21:18] <ngoldbaum> no you can mix and match
[19:21:20] <river> i mean, original covid vaccine
[19:21:27] <prussian> i'll mix and match. fuck it. the appointment times are better for me lmao
[19:21:28] <river> we dont need an omicron specific one/
[19:21:32] <ngoldbaum> yes it‚Äôs the same vaccine
[19:21:39] <epilys> river, they haven't approved any new vaccines, no
[19:21:40] <river> ok
[19:21:40] <companion_cube> river: smaller dose iirc
[19:21:43] <ngoldbaum> no one has released a delta or omicron modification
[19:21:52] <ngoldbaum> it‚Äôs all the same original covid strain from 2019
[19:21:59] <ngoldbaum> covid classic
[19:22:41] <companion_cube> vanilla covid
[19:22:42] <epilys> hoping the next approval will be for a multi-strain one like the flu shot
[19:25:10] <prussian> kk, time to get sick time off monday
[19:25:15] <prussian> scheduled and done.
[19:25:22] <defect> i got the same booster as i got initially mainly because i didn't really have any side effects from the first round
[19:27:15] <epilys> I did pfizer x3 and interestingly I got worse side effects for the second one, mild for the third and none for the first
[19:27:24] <prussian> too bad I'll have to drive to Hartford Hospital. why can't I just roll up on a CVS?
[19:27:34] <prussian> oh... there is a 3am at a cvs near me. what the fuck?
[19:27:39] <ngoldbaum> you can roll up to a costco
[19:27:42] <Xe> first covid shot left me useless for the weekend lol
[19:27:46] <prussian> they do it at costco?
[19:27:48] <prussian> damn...
[19:27:54] <ngoldbaum> yeah you don‚Äôt need to be a member either
[19:28:04] <ngoldbaum> $20
[19:28:04] <defect> getting injections at 3am sounds a bit sketchy
[19:28:10] <prussian> the future is now.
[19:28:34] <prussian> i forgot costgo has a pharmacy
[19:28:46] <epilys> defect, lol, imagine being diabetic
[19:28:51] <ngoldbaum> a lot of people do! it was pretty nice to get my shot there
[19:28:58] <epilys> injections at 4am, orange juice at 2am
[19:29:49] <prussian> ya no shit
[19:30:12] <prussian> well. Hartford Hospital seems to have the best times
[19:30:30] <prussian> so I guess I'm fucked. if only I scheduled, I could have gotten it today at Windham right now.
[19:30:35] <prussian> sooner*
[19:31:12] <ngoldbaum> CT?
[19:31:22] <prussian> yes
[19:31:25] <ngoldbaum> i‚Äôd also check if there are state-run drive-up sites

[19:42:35] <ngoldbaum> what is even happening with this drama
[19:43:32] <imode> programmers are drama llamas.
[19:43:39] <river> its a secret!
[19:43:49] <imode> obsessive drama llamas.
[19:44:43] <river> > We appreciate everyone's concern, however until we can sort things, I would encourage you all to keep discussion on the Reddit thread
[19:44:52] <river> meanwhile, on the reddit thread: [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted]
[19:45:00] <imode> all comments deleted, thread locked.

[19:48:54] <ngoldbaum> speaking of drama llamas https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29485904
[19:48:54] <buttsbot> Do you ever avoid submitting something on HN so devs won't ruin it? | Hacker News
[19:49:06] <prussian> I think everyone is a drama llama, it's just that coder kiddos got a bigger megaphone to blow
[19:49:07] * ngoldbaum never gave a shit about dislike counts
[19:50:12] <imode> reddit recap was.. interesting.
[19:50:24] <prussian> so what actually happened?
[19:50:47] <prussian> does anyone know?
[19:50:55] <imode> pretty sure you know as much as we all do.
[19:51:00] <ngoldbaum> it‚Äôs not public
[19:51:05] <prussian> oh ok, so basically bunk
[19:51:25] <ngoldbaum> i mean, something happened
[19:51:27] <prussian> couldn't they have kept this PR like, off the record as well then?
[19:51:38] <imode> the action was public, the cause is not.
[19:51:41] <ngoldbaum> but the mod team decided to publicly complain about it without disclosing what it was
[19:51:46] <prussian> seems like flame-bait made worse with no substance.
[19:51:55] <ngoldbaum> yeah it‚Äôs definitely weird af
[19:52:18] <ngoldbaum> also predictable a bunch of people were slandering ashley williams in response
[19:52:28] <ngoldbaum> whether or not she was actually involved in any way
[19:52:45] <prussian> well duh..
[19:53:00] <river> I wonder why they are so scared to talk about what's happening
[19:53:12] <river> it seems like something very serious
[19:53:25] <companion_cube> yeah it's kind of scary, ngoldbaum
[19:53:32] <companion_cube> she seemed nice when I met her in person
[19:53:40] <manicennui> I still don't understand why anyone cares about dislikes on YT.
[19:53:42] <companion_cube> and there seems to be a lot of people mad at her for some node.js stuff
[19:53:54] <ngoldbaum> river: it was to avoid generating a pile-on
[19:53:58] <imode> from what I read they were semi-right to be mad, I guess.
[19:54:03] <ngoldbaum> except that happened anyway so it was all kinda pointless
[19:54:22] <imode> either that or it was another he-said-she-said brouahaha.
[19:57:04] *** Joins: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge)
[19:57:08] <imode> no meetings today. \o/
[19:58:11] <manicennui> How will you know what to work on?!
[19:58:17] <manicennui> Or whether work is getting done?
[19:59:10] <imode> ikr. seems like autonomy doesn't exist. :P
[20:00:13] <manicennui> I'm pretty sure that I spend more time talking about work than doing it.
[20:00:54] <imode> mood.
[20:01:42] <manicennui> If we just talk about work enough with people who don't even need to be involved, we will get more done, or something.
[20:02:17] <river> how've you been doing recently imode?
[20:02:25] <manicennui> The weird thing is, I don't have any real interference from high level management or execs at this job.
[20:05:52] <imode> river: I've been doing pretty well, actually. enjoying work, got to see my parents again and now there's regular contact.
[20:06:04] <imode> looking forward to the holidays. things just seem a bit brighter.
[20:06:14] <imode> you?
[20:06:29] <river> thats amazing!
[20:06:37] <river> im getting along great, having a blast learning a new lang with aoc
[20:06:56] <river> also been trying to learn lock picking which seems like a fun but expensive hobby
[20:07:15] <imode> oooo
[20:07:18] <imode> an LPL fan I see.
[20:07:28] <river> yep, thats what got me into it :P
[20:07:41] <manicennui> Expensive for locks or the tools to pick them?
[20:07:58] <river> yeah just buying lots of locks to practice on
[20:08:09] <imode> just become a locksmith, problem solved.
[20:08:11] <manicennui> Just use your skills to pick the locks of stores and steal their locks.
[20:08:22] <river> I thought people would just give away locks after they lost the keys, but no!
[20:09:23] <epilys> go out late, pick old forgotten padlocks
[20:09:32] <imode> final boss is a bank vault.
[20:09:36] <epilys> "i'm just strolling around, officer"
[20:10:35] <manicennui> Find one of those bridges or fences where people add locks.
[20:10:46] <epilys> good idea
[20:10:55] <manicennui> Or bikes locked up on the street.
[20:12:08] <epilys> or your neighbors doors
[20:12:14] <manicennui> Exactly.
[20:12:17] <manicennui> There are locks everywhere.
[20:20:39] <prussian> the world is your oyster
[20:22:47] <manicennui> Silly oysters don't even lock up their pearls.

[20:58:13] <indigo> Now that there is Rust in the Linux kernel, can we also put C++ in there as well
[20:58:14] <buttsbot> That's nice, but have you considered writing it in HTML instead of Rust?
[20:58:20] <indigo> HTML works too
[21:00:46] <hoistbypetard> for some people, AoC means Advent of Chanel, apparently: https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/12/07/chanel-advent-calendar-outrage-tiktok/
[21:06:56] <imode> if you're that stupid you deserve to be fleeced.
[21:08:13] <imode> if you have enough money to drop on an $800 advent calendar, I relish your loss of money, you deserved it.
[21:11:54] <companion_cube> can't wait for NFT advent calendars
[21:12:20] <imode> ubisoft has you covered.
[21:16:37] <imode> dude
[21:17:07] <imode> kinda hyped for new matrix tbh.
[21:17:31] <indigo> Old Keanu!
[21:18:35] <imode> second trailer is much better than the first.
[21:21:12] <imode> tbf I just hope we get something animatrix-like after all's said and done.
[21:21:39] <imode> that was a bangin' collection.
[21:52:06] <ngoldbaum> i kinda want to see what this ps5 demo thing is
[21:54:14] <imode> ps5 demo?

[22:23:43] <manicennui> Which right wing views are popular in France?
[22:24:50] <dmc> lol
[22:25:15] <manicennui> Racism against immigrants I imagine.
[22:26:08] <companion_cube> anti immigrants, strongly anti muslim, anti LGBT
[22:27:22] <manicennui> The last one is surprising. There are famous gay people from the US who went to France during the mid 20th century.
[22:27:31] <manicennui> Assumed it was not really an issue there.
[22:27:48] <bkero> Gertrude Stein?
[22:28:09] <manicennui> James Baldwin
[22:28:12] <manicennui> Among others.
[22:28:14] <epilys> there's variety in right wing views?
[22:29:42] <manicennui> epilys: Apparently right wing assholes aren't anti-vax everywhere.
[22:30:14] <epilys> like, party-wise or the voters?
[22:30:30] <manicennui> Both I think.

[22:39:35] * manicennui prepares for 2.5 hours of meetings.
[22:41:44] <manicennui> So I kept watching Succession, and I actually think that it is brilliant.
[22:42:03] <manicennui> The thing that isn't obvious, and I don't know that they'd admit it, is that it is a dark comedy played really straight.
[22:44:59] <manicennui> There are bits that bring to mind things like The Office, Arrested Development, and Armando Iannucci's work (In The Loop, The Death of Stalin).
[22:45:14] <manicennui> But the comedy is way more subdued.
[22:47:34] <manicennui> The real life influences are also interesting. The family and company are obviously partially based on the Murdochs and News Corp, but also other things.
[22:48:38] <ngoldbaum> except apparently jeremy strong thinks it‚Äôs hamlet
[22:48:59] <ngoldbaum> there was a profile of him published recently that makes him seem like a loon
[22:49:09] <manicennui> That's kind of perfect though.
[22:49:14] <manicennui> It really is a strange mix.
[22:49:17] <ngoldbaum> but it makes sense for kendall to take everything suuuuper seriously
[22:49:35] <manicennui> Yeah.
[22:51:33] <manicennui> I can't really think of another show that is similar.
[22:51:57] <manicennui> Most other shows are clearly comedy with some serious moments or drama with some funny moments.
[22:52:29] <manicennui> I think most of the things that happen on Succession are darkly hilarious but done in a super serious manner.
[22:53:09] <manicennui> The characters I thought had some potential early on are also complete assholes, like Kendall.
[22:55:15] <ngoldbaum> darkhorse greg too
[22:55:29] <manicennui> Yeah, at moments he sees good, but he is really looking out for himself.
[22:56:18] <manicennui> A lot of the things I see about what the actors think about characters on the show leads me to believe that maybe they aren't even fully in on the joke.
[22:56:46] <manicennui> Like they believe maybe their character will suddenly do the right thing or get ahead.
[23:27:20] <gwozniak> My wife and I watched the first season and we thought it was very well done, but we didn't keep watching because we don't like the characters
[23:28:08] <imode> a lot of people drop out due to that. I did.
[23:28:10] <gwozniak> I do think it's more comedy than anything else
[23:28:18] <gwozniak> But yeah, super dark comedy
[23:28:50] <gwozniak> I may try watching it later, but not with my wife because she definitely doesn't want to bother
[23:33:12] <ngoldbaum> yeah the sopranos are bad people
[23:33:18] <ngoldbaum> but also like tony is likable
[23:33:39] <ngoldbaum> no one on succession is likable
[23:33:54] <gwozniak> this is the problem
[23:35:48] <gwozniak> oddly enough, we didn't finish The Sopranos either, but that wasn't because we didn't like it or any of the characters
[23:36:22] <gwozniak> It was back in the DVD rental days and we just never got around to season 2
[23:38:07] *** moose` is now known as moose
[23:44:31] *** Quits: dmc (~dmc@archlinux/trusteduser/polyzen) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[23:47:35] <manicennui> gwozniak: I honestly thought about stopping during the first season, but now I'm glad I continued.
[23:47:53] <manicennui> But yes, the characters are all terrible people, and none of them have redeemed themselves.
[23:50:51] <gwozniak> Peer pressure may eventually have me checking out season 2
[23:52:45] *** Joins: dmc (~dmc@archlinux/trusteduser/polyzen)
[23:55:43] <manicennui> There are things that happened in season 1 that I now have a very different view of.
[23:56:23] <manicennui> Including something that I think happened in the very first episode, where Kendall was trying to act tough and insult the CEO of the company they were trying to acquire.
[23:57:31] <manicennui> It felt kind of odd when I saw it, because his insults and threats seemed very empty.
[23:57:35] <manicennui> Now I realize why.
[23:58:54] <manicennui> He is basically cargo culting his father.
[23:59:12] <manicennui> But his father's threats are real.
