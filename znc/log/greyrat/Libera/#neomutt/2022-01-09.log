[02:20:08] <noex> can you autosize the pager fields by the actual longest length of a field with some cutoff or something? like auto with a max of X chars?

[02:24:54] <flatcap> sorry, I don't quite follow
[02:25:19] <flatcap> the email headers?
[02:25:20] <noex> no clue why i said pager, sorry. i meant index.
[02:25:35] <noex> the index format string
[02:26:24] <flatcap> ah, you can put limits and padding in the index_format
[02:26:45] <flatcap> %s means the entire subject, however long
[02:27:03] <flatcap> %30s means pad the subject to 30 chars minimum
[02:27:18] <flatcap> %30.30s means min 30, max 30
[02:28:30] <flatcap> (there's also some magic you can do with something like `%> ` which means pad with spaces, if there's room -- it's clever but I always have to look it up)
[02:29:13] <noex> flatcap: nice thanks. you put that so succinctly lol.
[02:29:19] <flatcap> np
[02:29:38] <flatcap> oh, you'll need that to be %-30.30s to be left-justified
[02:29:53] <noex> ah i did have a minimum.  that's why.
[02:30:05] <noex> so i think i just need to remove the minimum
[02:30:25] <noex> then it will auto-size up the max
[02:31:18] <noex> i guess that's just %-0.30s
[02:31:56] <noex> flatcap: thanks this is way better!
[02:32:06] <flatcap> np
[02:32:47] <noex> could you do a multi-line index format if you wanted?
[02:33:41] <noex> IE %F\n%s or something
[02:33:43] <flatcap> no, sorry
[02:33:59] <noex> that would be pretty sweet though
[02:34:18] <flatcap> I've thought long and hard about it, but it would be a lot of complicated work
[02:34:27] <flatcap> (unless someone volunteers :-)
[02:34:40] <noex> is it a curses thing?
[02:34:59] * noex has never used a tui library
[02:35:02] <flatcap> no.  in this case it's the existing Menu code that'd have to be overhauled
[02:35:07] <noex> gotcha
[02:35:47] <flatcap> it'd be great, no doubt!  there'd be SO many possible uses for it
[02:36:16] <noex> things always sound simple when you're ignorant. i set up PCs for a client one time and a lady told me to "just use wireless power supplies" for the computers
[02:37:27] <flatcap> hehe.  physics is against us there!
[02:37:45] <noex> that's me right now. "just make a newline" *has no knowledge of the code base at all*
[02:37:56] <noex> :)
[02:38:07] <flatcap> :-)
[02:38:53] <flatcap> found it.  `%*X` vs `%>` padding
[02:39:32] <flatcap> my $index_format ends with  `... %s%* (%c)`
[02:40:16] <flatcap> that mean use as much space as you like for the subject `%s`, pad with space `%* ` then print the size `(%c)`
[02:41:15] <flatcap> `%* ` is soft padding.  If there isn't space for both subject and size, then the subject gets magically truncated
[02:41:49] <flatcap> changing that to `... %s%> (%c)` hard padding means
[02:42:44] <noex> oh, neat
[02:43:05] <flatcap> if there isn't enough space, then the ending will be overwritten (subject has priority)
[02:44:09] <flatcap> it's very clever, I need to read the manual and experiment to remember which does what :-)

[17:31:56] <blaub> i wish I could show the index of messages in a multiline way
[17:32:12] <blaub> it looks a bit too compact to me, especially coming from a more modern gui like gmail
[17:32:17] <flatcap> yes, it's not possible.  noex and I were discussing this last night
[17:32:54] <flatcap> it could be done, of course, but it'd be a lot of work and we simply don't have the developers
[17:35:15] <blaub> flatcap: oh thanks for your answer! i just thought it would be nice to get a similiar view to gmail and show the first few characters of the email body and maybe the subject as bold font. anyway, mutt does a really great job already
[17:37:37] <flatcap> daedric had a go at it, he created a "preview window", for the current email, but he didn't finish and disappeared
[17:38:45] <flatcap> the preview branch is archived in the neomutt-old repo: https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt-old

[18:19:22] <dcpurton> Hi flatcap
[18:19:40] <dcpurton> I'm making OK progress (with a lot of git rebase -i …)
[18:19:58] <flatcap> hi dcpurton 
[18:20:02] <flatcap> that's great news
[18:20:52] <dcpurton> I'm trying to put in a bunch of commits at the start that fix the numerous bugs in the present implementation to make it clearer what I'm doing and why
[18:21:11] <dcpurton> But there's a bad memory leak
[18:21:34] <dcpurton> And to fix this properly along the way requires a lot of recursive code, that in the end I won't need
[18:22:37] <flatcap> hmm...
[18:23:05] <dcpurton> In the end I'm still going to need a big commit that adds in the tree view
[18:23:06] <flatcap> if your code fixes the problem, then don't worry about leaks in the history
[18:23:16] <dcpurton> OK
[18:23:45] <flatcap> I'd love a beautiful legible history, but I'm a realist :-)
[18:23:59] <dcpurton> adds in the tree view and the postponing /resumeing I think
[18:24:19] <dcpurton> To split it up too much just results in a broken commit
[18:24:33] <flatcap> fair enough
[18:24:57] <dcpurton> I'll see
[18:25:35] <flatcap> I've been busy with my Sunday crossword, this morning, but I have managed to knock up some interesting automation code!
[18:26:36] <flatcap> a handful of functions that randomly push compose functions into the keyboard buffer
[18:26:57] <flatcap> no structure, just stochastic testing :-)
[18:27:33] <flatcap> I haven't hit any crashes or leaks yet
