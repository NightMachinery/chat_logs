[00:21:02] <R0b0t1> btw I usually mount things from the command line, because there's lots of knobs and GUIs can mess it up

[02:02:14] <alexandre[m]> it should take line breaks out of a file, but i am pretty sure the out pipe has priority (so when piping the file to tr it will be empty
[02:02:35] <phogg> ignapk: hardware problems are likely to require hardware solutions. Maybe someone knows how to look at the sound card/speaker and find the issue, but I don't.
[02:02:53] <phogg> alexandre[m]: you cannot read from and write to the same file in the same pass like that
[02:03:28] <phogg> alexandre[m]: tr actually doesn't do anything with file.txt, but bash does (because of the redirect). Bash will open file.txt for writing and truncate it before tr even starts, which prevents tr from reading it

[06:02:41] <tirnanog> if you know that, why are you saying that iptables -L is pretty much the same thing? it's not. nft list ruleset lists the entire ruleset. which brings me full circle. iptables-save -c is comparable, not "iptables anything".
[06:03:08] <jbm> tirnanog, did I claim "iptables -L" shows everythig? -- it was a quick comparison of "syntax" that is simpler to use than nft.

[06:06:05] <jbm> acaciause, thank you
[06:06:11] <akoana> sybariten: but shouldn't android have something that lets you control print quality and scaling`
[06:06:11] <tirnanog> it's not pure subjective perspective, anyway. if you asked someone who had used neither what "nft list ruleset" might do, there's a good chance they might guess right. if you asked them what iptables-save does, you might get a different answer.
[06:06:14] <akoana> ?
[06:06:15] <tirnanog> it's a*
[06:06:29] <jbm> acaciause, even though I can use both -- nft on one system, iptables on the other --- dockerd requires "iptables" regardless..
[06:06:34] <tirnanog> yes, it's longer. doesn't mean it's simpler, necessarily.
[06:06:44] <sybariten> akoana: basically the thing that works best, has been 1.) printing text with the Windows drivers in something like notepad (nota bene: again, not from chrome) or 2.) printing directly from the printer computer by piping text to the CUPS tools in a terminal .... the latter thing there is what lead me to want to do something where first i tell the machine what to print, and then the machine sends it

[13:45:13] <tomreyn> reset404: you don't have to. you could also configure it not to log, so log files would not fill the disk, or you could let them fill the disk, or you could set up a cron job to notify you to remind you to manually delete the logs. and a couple other things.

[14:50:26] <PaulFertser> TJ-: firmware runs on the card itself. You can upload it by other means and there's a clear hardware separation between the code running on the card and the driver in Linux. I do not think you can say one is part of the other.

[17:21:29] <hexnewbie> TJ-: I thought of this because I do know expanded memory was initially sold on boards (and stuff like EMM386 was merely software emulation for those boards), so it was odd that the world transitioned from buying memory to ... downloading it on a floppy for money :)

[17:25:22] <hexnewbie> TJ-: Funny enough, I think I asked my parents why you can't simply buy infinite amount of memory (could have used ‘gigabyte’), and put it in external computer cases for it to be there. And expanded memory was kind of like that, to an extent. And they told me you can't. So I was later fascinated to learn expanded memory was just what I had initially imagined, except EMM386 was an emulartor for it

[21:00:55] <reillybrogan> It's a known issue with the new version of xorg. Check with your distro on whether or not it's possible to roll back or wait for a patch fixing it
