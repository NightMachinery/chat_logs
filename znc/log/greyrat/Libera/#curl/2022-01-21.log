[01:35:27] <skered> Am I just dealing with old curl (el8 curl 7.61.1) where curl will accept an SSL chain even if one of the parts is untrusted?  CA (trusted) -> Int. (untrusted but signed by CA) -> Server (signed by int.)
[01:35:54] <skered> Firefox and Chromium reject the connection.
[01:36:15] <bagder> curious
[01:36:39] <bagder> not to cast any blame, but that verification is done by the TLS library curl uses
[01:36:59] <bagder> is that NSS?
[01:37:10] <skered> I think on el8 it's openssl.
[01:37:45] <bagder> ok, so how is the intermediate "untrusted" but signed?
[01:38:29] <skered> By me putting it in blacklist/ and running update-ca-trust
[01:42:07] <skered> I can say s_client does the same thing.
[01:42:27] <skered> So maybe it's one of those grey areas of SSL acceptance?
[01:43:12] <skered> But I guess in all cases it's an openssl thing then?
[01:43:20] <bagder> yeah, that operation is done entirely by openssl. I don't know how it does or doesn't handle blacklisting of specific certs used as intermediates etc
[01:43:41] <bagder> I wish I did
[01:44:56] <skered> Me too.  I'm trying to document the process of how to handle soon to be expiring int. certs with an Intneral CA and how to best handle the time between the expire date and it being valid.  Current idea is to revoke it once everyone gets a new cert.

[03:56:04] <Piru> openssl doesn't really do crl either
[03:56:48] <Piru> it does have some limited OCSP stapling support but you need to implement the callback logic for it
[03:57:42] <Piru> as mentioned openssl doesn't really do revocation at all
[03:59:07] <Piru> the crl lists, OCSP etc was a bad idea to begin with. implementing that stuff is horrible, crl lists grow insanely larger, the OCSP calls leak information, make connections slower etc
[03:59:24] <Piru> OCSP stapling is better, but IMHO having short enough cert lifetime is the only "fix"

[12:54:49] * jfuller let the bikeshedding and yak shaving commence
[12:54:50] <dch> the other support I added to gurl was to do automatic HMAC signing of JSON bodies
[12:54:56] <bagder> you'd have to quote that list of json, which then would break some of the good idea of it

[12:55:20] <dch> because of curl, or because of shells?
[12:55:35] <bagder> because you can't invent a new way to parse args for curl
[12:55:54] <bagder> well, you *can*
[12:55:59] <dch> that is what I expected and seems entirely reasonable
[12:56:12] *** Joins: thorre (~thorre@user/thorre)
[12:56:41] <bagder> that's one reason why I put the --jp idea the way I did
[12:56:52] <bagder> another being that I don't really know how people do json =)
[12:57:20] <dch> `env HMAC sha256:x-signature:$(vault read -field=hmac secret/ci) gurl -json=true -hmac HMAC POST http://prince.party:1999/...`
[12:57:40] <dch> I don't imagine the hmac support but it is *super* handy for poking APIs
[12:58:11] <dch> as the precise HMAC signature depends on how the json object is constructed and pushed out over the wire
[12:58:27] <bagder> but no matter how we do this, the only viable approach is to do it in small steps so there's also a challenge in finding a small set that is a good and working idea
[12:58:38] <bagder> so things like signing content is like step 72
[12:58:42] <dch> that was btw my original reason for extending `bat` was to get HMAC support, of signed JSON, without confusing people
[12:58:50] <dch> but baby steps first
[12:58:51] <nimaje> dch: and how would you do lists or objects without creating them yourself? as the goal here is to more or less easily create json without quoting issues and allowing to use shells variable expansion
[13:00:03] <dch> nimaje: fair point. we checked our shell histories, and found that 99% of our JSON api stuff is `POST /there {"key": true}` so very simple objects.
[13:00:39] <bagder> I think it is fair to draw the line somewhere and say "for more advanced things, create that outside and pass in a file"
[13:00:49] <dch> for lists, I would just do `curl --json '["1","2","3"]'` like that I guess.
[13:01:24] <dch> eventually your json becomes so complex that it needs validation, and then you may as well use jq or a scripting language
[13:01:32] <bagder> yes
[13:01:42] <bagder> then you're clearly in that territory
[13:02:05] <dch> IMO there is a tipping point around 3-4 parameters where the gain of curl-ish tools becomes bane and pain
[13:02:28] <Tykling> if only we had a third quoting character in addition to ' and " all our problems would be solved

[13:02:42] <dch> there you go
[13:02:49] <bagder> we clearly need to do a curlsh first, the curl shell

[13:09:32] <gevaerts> dch: oh, I know. I've not run Windows at work ever. But some people...
[13:10:15] <gevaerts> I've used Windows at home a bit, but I stopped about twenty years ago and it was always dual-boot
[13:10:28] <bagder> dch: I think so. --json would be the first basic one that is mostly an alias for -d + right header
[13:10:40] <dch> then one might be able to do `--json key=value` `--json boolean:true` ?
[13:11:06] <bagder> I think using another option name for that is better rather than overloading it on the same
[13:11:16] <bagder> that's why I did --jp in the wiki page
[13:11:23] <dch> what I'm thinking is that whatever the string following the flag is, we know its supposed to be json
[13:11:27] * dch nods
[13:11:56] <bagder> I have a first basic impl of --json now, but it doesn't care or check the contents at all. It just assumes you give it json
[13:12:28] <dch> and we can apply a heuristic to the 2nd part true|false - must be bool, numberish must be a number, otherwise a string
[13:12:46] <bagder> I think so too
[13:12:46] <dch> then the remaining issues are, how to accept arrays and objects
[13:13:21] <dch> anyway I think this is the greatest innovation in curl since when it worked on windows, whatever comes out will be a major step forwards for everybody
[13:13:39] <dch> if you have a kitchen sink, then I say put everything into it!
[13:13:44] <bagder> thanks
[13:13:48] <Piru> did json solve the 32bit vs 64bit and unsigned vs signed int issues btw?
[13:13:50] <bagder> it's not what everyone thinks though...
[13:14:08] <dch> https://knowyourphrase.com/everything-but-the-kitchen-sink
[13:14:24] <Piru> like can yuo have 2147483648 in json?
[13:14:28] <Piru> you
[13:14:37] <dch> Piru: yes** you should read the json spec.
[13:14:56] <dch> this is a problem of the sending/receiving ends, to figure out how to marshal stuff into their data type
[13:14:57] <Piru> because xml is icky in this regard
[13:15:23] <dch> bagder: oh, you will need to make a call regarding `key=value, key=other` 
[13:15:31] <bagder> yeah
[13:15:34] <dch> json spec permits multiple keys with the same name
[13:15:36] <Piru> ok reboot, bbl
[13:15:57] <dch> almost nobody does this in practice, because they're putting it into associative arrays / dictionaries.

[13:16:12] <dch> in erlang, we used a datastructure that supports this for precisely this use case.
[13:16:28] <jfuller> we might want some thin abstraction in terms of other formats ...
[13:16:36] <jfuller> eg even if its whatever json vnext is
[13:16:37] <dch> I've not seen a single person be surprised by this in practice, but its definitely a security vulnerability in other cases
[13:16:52] <dch> there are at least 3 competing json++ specs
[13:16:54] <Piru> hmph. not yet, one backup run is not yet ready
[13:16:59] <bagder> jfuller: ... or save that for when/if something else ever comes ...
[13:17:11] <dch> https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7493 i-json was quite sensible
[13:17:22] <jfuller> I see it as an escape route, not a feature ;)
[13:17:25] <jfuller> defensive
[13:17:40] <bagder> right, but we don't have to do any abstractions ahead of time
[13:18:14] <dch> Piru: i-json and the newer ecmascript standard explicitly address your big int problem, https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=7493&rec_status=0 for example

[15:44:11] <nimaje> why does the https://curl.se/curl.css stylesheet override color for a (and then not overriding color for a:visited)? you should just let the user config their colors in the browser or at least if you really want to override color for a also override it for a:visited, so one can see which links where already visited and which not
