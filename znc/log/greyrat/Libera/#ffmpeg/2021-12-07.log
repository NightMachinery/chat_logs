[00:30:00] <emcodem> depends on the service
[00:30:33] <mago> Dont get you, didnt you say the mpd were static, like the same for all clients..

[00:32:26] *** Quits: minimal (~minimal@user/minimal) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:32:42] <emcodem> i guess they protect the access in some way, be it the http layer or the cdn layer. now as you say i think i have even seen akamai generating the links on a per-client base
[00:33:47] <mago> So they might stop being valid after midnight?
[00:33:56] <emcodem> depends on the service
[00:34:02] <mago> What is cdn?
[00:34:12] <emcodem> where the files are hosted on
[00:34:34] <emcodem> -> thats a cdn
[00:35:05] <emcodem> content delivery network (i believe :D)
[00:35:09] <mago> Yes the urls do contain akamaized ..
[00:35:44] <emcodem> those are pro's in protecting content, i don't think you can access the stuff when your subscription expired
[00:36:55] <mago> Thats an example of the manifesto:https://109vod-adaptive.akamaized.net/exp=1638861997~acl=%2F276b4cd8-27b6-43cd-ae0c-69d6ace15bf4%2F%2A~hmac=7b6e38128800d079d66eb5fdf126f1109a74995815c924603b426e6e4edac202/276b4cd8-27b6-43cd-ae0c-69d6ace15bf4/sep/video/ac13d541,88210818,1a13e722,4b9b7550,27c8290f/audio/8b895303,bb47b2a3/master.json?query_string_ranges=1&base64_init=1
[00:37:41] <mago> You can change .json?query_string_ranges=1&base64_init=1 for .mpd
[00:38:42] <mago> Shortened the url: shorturl.at/rFOQR
[00:39:37] <mago> What you reckon that link and its content won't be valid after midnight? emcodem?
[00:39:41] <mago> emcodem
[00:40:46] <emcodem> yeah yup expires soon
[00:41:00] <emcodem> exp=1638861997
[00:41:07] <JEEB> many CDNs offer HMAC based authentication
[00:41:13] <JEEB> where tokens usually expire after some time
[00:41:39] <JEEB> you can look up akamai's docs for it, you will most likely see that the result looks very similar to the token that you have in that URL :P
[00:41:59] <mago> What does exp=1638861997 mean? Is it a time unit?
[00:42:04] <emcodem> unix time
[00:42:19] <emcodem> Tue Dec 07 2021 07:26:37 GMT+0000
[00:43:04] <mago> Ok, so it doesnt expire at midnight? Its tomorrow early morning?
[00:43:44] <emcodem> if they work on GMT 0 timezone yes :D
[00:44:17] <mago> Guess it's in case i start watching one of them just before expiration, they do last 3 hours each..
[00:44:34] <emcodem> hmm probably
[00:44:43] <JEEB> also often services' clients see if you have something open say for a few hours
[00:45:01] <JEEB> and then if the client gets an access error it will request a new HMAC auth token from the service
[00:45:18] <JEEB> (or you get an error in the client to retry playback :P)

[03:50:14] <kepstin> that's a default feature of pulseaudio (and the default pipewire session manager too), yeah

[03:57:51] <hyrc> it's a reasonable standard.  the sound system should be able to find an active input device (perhaps testing for nonzero input)
[03:58:15] <hyrc> and have prioritized classes of devices that override
[04:01:29] <mojtaba> kepstin: ffmpeg -f pulse -i default .... It does not get the audio from the bluetooth device.
[04:02:36] <kepstin> then that would be because the bluetooth device isn't the default. use your desktop settings panel or pavucontrol to switch the default, as i described
[04:02:55] <kepstin> (once you've set a config for a device like that, pulseaudio is supposed to remember it next time you connect the device, i think)
[04:03:16] <mojtaba> kepstin: How should I make it the default input?
[04:03:35] <kepstin> by doing the thing that i said to do in the message i just wrote
[04:03:47] <mojtaba> This? (07:06:42 PM) kepstin: which you can reconfigure in your desktop settings or with e.g. pavucontrol
[04:04:05] <kepstin> that was the first time i said it, yes; i even repeated myself a moment ago
[04:04:15] <mojtaba> in my desktop settings my bluetooth device is default.
[04:04:20] <mojtaba> when I connect it.
[04:04:39] <kepstin> default input device? or output device?
[04:04:43] <kepstin> those are separate configs
[04:05:00] <kepstin> also, is your bluetooth device configured in a two way mode with mic, or for sound playback only?
[04:05:18] <kepstin> note that when you switch a bluetooth device to 2-way headset mode, you get much lower audio quality
[04:05:29] <mojtaba> It is playing sound only, but that would be great if I could use its mic too, instead.
[04:05:46] <mojtaba> Then it is better to keep it one way
[04:06:20] <kepstin> there should be an option in your sound settings to switch the device mode to headset
[04:06:25] <mojtaba> It is set as default for the output device, but not as default input.
[04:07:01] <kepstin> if you switch it to headset mode, then it will appear as a selectable audio input device.
[04:08:10] <mojtaba> Yes I saw it under the input devices, but for now, lets keep it just as output and record it.
[04:08:27] <mojtaba> the default argument does not work as explained
[04:08:39] <kepstin> oh.. you want to record a monitor of the output? i thought you wanted to record the headset mic
[04:08:55] <kepstin> the default records off the default input device - which is, well, an input device, not an output device
[04:09:28] <mojtaba> My bad, I want to record the output of my bluetooth

[04:09:54] <mago> Hi
[04:09:58] <mojtaba> Hi
[04:10:07] <mago> How can i redownload only the audio with youtube-dl
[04:10:24] <mojtaba> mago, it has an option for that; wait a sec
[04:10:29] <mago> Like i already downloaded the mpd video and audio and merged.. But it has an error..
[04:11:15] <mojtaba> mago: youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3   http://www.youtube.com/URL
[04:11:30] <mago> Its an mpd url
[04:11:41] <mojtaba> what is mpd url?
[04:11:43] <mago> Will it work the same?
[04:11:47] <mago> LIke an mpd manifesto
[04:11:54] <mojtaba> can you provide the link?
[04:11:58] <emcodem> works the same
[04:12:13] <kepstin> mago: best bet would be to move the already downloaded video to a different filename, re-run the youtube-dl command with the options to only fetch audio (read the man page...) and then use ffmpeg to merge the new audio into the previous video file.
[04:12:20] <mojtaba> kepstin: Any further recommendation about the output?
[04:12:58] <kepstin> mojtaba: to record off a monitor device, you have to either specify the monitor device by name, or use pavucontrol to switch the device in use after starting ffmpeg.
[04:13:16] <kepstin> there's no automatic "monitor of the default output device" alias as far as i know
[04:14:10] <mojtaba> kepstin: Do you know how can I list them and loop through them in a one liner?
[04:14:41] <mojtaba> something like this: ffmpeg -f pulse -i "$(awk '$2~/.monitor$/ {print $2; exit;}' <(pactl list short sources))" -i <(arecord -f CD) -filter_complex amix -acodec libmp3lame "$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S)".mp3
[04:14:55] <mojtaba> but instead of grabbing one, grabbing all of them.
[04:16:06] <mago> Like.. youtbe-dl url/x.mpd downloads video audio and merges..
[04:16:19] <mago> Is there a way to redo that but only downloading the audio?
[04:16:29] <mago> Will I have to merge manually=?
[04:16:33] <mojtaba> mago: --extract-audio --audio-format mp3
[04:16:40] <mojtaba> use these
[04:16:50] <kepstin> well, don't use the --audio-format option, since you want to get the audio as-is
[04:16:52] <mago> Yes, i did that and its downloading the audio, will it merge automatically?
[04:17:08] <kepstin> no, it will not merge automatically
[04:17:26] <kepstin> you can use ffmpeg to do that yourself afterwards (i mean, you're here already...)
[04:19:05] <kepstin> mojtaba: in order to record from multiple devices you need to do multiple inputs, which would means multiple arguments to ffmpeg rather than just one. So scripting it would be a bit more work.
[04:19:54] <kepstin> mojtaba: if you're using pipewire rather than pulseaudio you can use a single input in ffmpeg and an external patchbay tool (e.g. helvum) to connect multiple sources to it, but that would be manual setup :/
[04:19:57] <emcodem> just make sure you are exhausting your bandwidth with downloading currtenly @mago, as long as you got the stuff, problems can be solved later on :D
[04:19:58] <mojtaba> kepstin: I will work on the scripting part, but to get the list of the input and outputs should I use pactl list short sources?
[04:20:14] <kepstin> mojtaba: the "sources" means it's a list of input devices
[04:20:31] <mago> emcodem I managed to get everything, think the unix expiration time was right and still have  a few hours..
[04:20:33] <kepstin> (which includes monitor devices, which are special input devices that contain the sound which would be output on some other device)
[04:20:49] <emcodem> very nice
[04:21:34] <mojtaba> kepstin: This is the output of that command:
[04:21:34] <mojtaba> 1	alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo.monitor	module-alsa-card.c	s16le 2ch 44100Hz	SUSPENDED
[04:21:34] <mojtaba> 2	alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo	module-alsa-card.c	s16le 2ch 44100Hz	SUSPENDED
[04:21:34] <mojtaba> 43	bluez_sink.20_16_03_16_CB_20.a2dp_sink.monitor	module-bluez5-device.c	s16le 2ch 44100Hz	IDLE
[04:22:01] <mojtaba> Should I loop through these 3 and provide them as an argument to the ffmpeg in a way?
[04:22:18] <kepstin> you can if that's what you want.
[04:22:38] <mojtaba> kepstin: I mean if I do that, it will record every output and input?
[04:22:58] <kepstin> it'll record from every input and from the monitor of every output, yes
[04:23:15] <kepstin> ("recording an output" doesn't make sense)
[04:23:40] <mojtaba> kepstin: I see. Thanks. one more question, why two of them are suspended?
[04:23:59] <kepstin> that just means nothing is using them right now, so they're in a low power mode
[04:24:18] <mojtaba> kepstin: I will try to come up with the script and will share it here.

[04:28:50] <mago> What do the map options do?
[04:32:37] <emcodem> map is ffmpeg basics, each map option creates a track in your output file and lets you select a track of the corresponding input file
[04:32:43] <emcodem> e.g.
[04:32:50] <emcodem> -map 0:v
[04:33:22] <emcodem> means in @kepstin 's command above: take the video track fo input file #0
[04:33:27] <emcodem> got it?
[04:35:05] <emcodem> i mean the bare existence of a -map option forces the creation of a track in your output file....
[04:35:33] <mago> Ok, so it creates 2 tracks.. 0 for video and 1 for audio?
[04:35:37] <emcodem> yup
[04:36:08] <mago> What would happen with those options?
[04:36:10] <emcodem> and 0:v selects the video track of your first input file
[04:36:22] <mago> ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -i audio.m4a -c copy fixed.mp4
[04:36:30] <emcodem> 1:a selects the audio tracks of your second input file
[04:36:59] <kepstin> mago: with the map options, it takes the video from the first input file and the audio from the second input file, and puts them together into the output file
[04:37:01] <emcodem> uhm i think it would only read the first input file or throw an error
[04:37:24] <kepstin> without them... i honestly forget, i usually always explicitly map with multiple inputs :)

[19:15:33] <LunaLovegood> Trying to use yadif=mode=1. How do you deal with the cases where if switches between tff and bff multiple times in the video file? It's from a VHS source.
[19:17:59] <LunaLovegood> I checked the "Timeline editing" part of the documentation, but yadif doesn't have an "enable" parameter, or options marked with "T".
[19:18:16] <LunaLovegood> Oh wait, it does have "enable" support. Sorry.

[19:58:27] <kepstin> that's strange, i dunno how you'd get switched field dominance on a VHS tape capture, usually tv capture cards have fixed field dominance.
[19:58:44] <kepstin> (if the original video had an issue on the tape, then that would look really odd on a CRT...)

[21:43:11] <nate_> I'm saving the files to the /tmp directory but I don't believe this to be cause of the issue. Does anyone know why these files would be getting deleted?

[21:56:53] <nate_> @emcodem there are 8 rtsp streams and it's random which ones are affected although there's specific ones it happens to more often. The system is a Debian 11 VM fresh install with some basic tools installed. So I don't think anything would be clearing it beyond the normal tmp cleaning that occurs

[21:58:47] <emcodem> dunno about debian but on centos files are cleared automatically, i believe based on atime

[22:00:54] <nate_> @emcodem Yeah, I believe debian is 30 days by default, but all streams are started by a script, so should share a close enough created date & they share the same directory. Only one of the 8 streams is currently affected. I don't believe this to be an issue with /tmp/. Is there a way to have ffmpeg regenerate the init files?
[22:00:59] <emcodem> can you share the file @KillerWasp?
[22:01:29] <KillerWasp> emcodem: https://0x0.st/-FzA.webp
[22:02:57] <KillerWasp> it's a nice animation. :P
[22:02:59] <emcodem> i wasnt even aware that there are init.mp4 files generated for a command like the noe you have  @nate_
[22:03:04] <KillerWasp> but i can play only in firefox.
[22:03:41] <nate_> @emcodem Actually... that is a good point...
[22:03:52] <nate_> In fact it doesn't does it...
[22:04:30] <nate_> These files are for dash, which is being handled by nginx. Which means this isn't an ffmpeg question at all.
[22:06:56] <emcodem> @KillerWasp looks like ffmpeg currently dont support this animated webp

[22:10:02] <emcodem> yeah @KillerWasp, browsers have support for it but not ffmpeg, not currently
[22:11:19] <KillerWasp> emcodem: By any chance is it a strong attempt on the part of google to monopolize and isolate the programs that play their formats?
[22:13:01] <emcodem> they do? i always thought it is the other way around... but honestly i am not into such kind of discussion :D

[23:12:38] <YakoYoku> You could extract frame by frame using `webpmux`
[23:13:08] <YakoYoku> And then pass the image sequence to FFmpeg
[23:14:35] <YakoYoku> `webpinfo` shows you the image details, might even show you the number of frames (?)
