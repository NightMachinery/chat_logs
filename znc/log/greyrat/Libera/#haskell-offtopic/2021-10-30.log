[04:43:03] <arahael> I was just looking at the wikipedia page for cornflakes earlier today. Turns out there was once a special advertised (in 1907, I think it was?), where girls would get a free box of cornflakes if they winked at the grocer.  I guess that counts!

[21:53:14] <zincy_> I think I have realised that there isn't really a good way to choose "what to learn next" when it comes to maths.
[21:53:54] <zincy_> It's impossible to predict how your thinking will evolve by subject.
[21:54:49] <zincy_> Another realisation - learning how to think mathematically is way more important than learning for useful applications
[21:55:14] <zincy_> Hence like programming languages learn C and Haskell (polar opposites) same should apply to other subjects like math.
[22:02:29] <__monty__> Math is a bit of an odd duck. Most people completely stop learning math when their degree ends. It's somehow harder to pick up later.
[22:06:12] <zincy_> Yeah I have a degree in politics and international relations and picked a bit of math up later.
[22:06:48] <zincy_> I wonder why most people stop after their degree.
[22:07:01] <zincy_> Maybe the same reason I haven't studied any politics after my degree haha
[22:08:03] <zincy_> __monty__: You are a mathematician right?
[22:10:53] <__monty__> No, not even close. Have a degree in CS.
[22:12:21] <hpc> some people stop even before then :(
