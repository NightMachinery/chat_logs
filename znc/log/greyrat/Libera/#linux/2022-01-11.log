[02:55:37] <simbaclaws> I've encouraged him to do so and would love to help out if need be, it would be pretty nice to have a visual representation of your current open socket streams for example

[05:09:42] <phogg> firepup: the way you would mount it would be... to do the equivalent of what losetup does. Something has to identify the byte range that makes up the partition.
[05:10:05] <cbondurant> phogg: but inet_ntop takes different arguments than inet_ntoa despite returning the same value, so the "to x" is what changes in the name but the input is what changes for the interface. so I cant really get what the n or p or a mean in that context

[09:37:48] <labrador> hmm basically make mine the "attessted secure one"?
[09:37:48] <lockywolf> and whether that module.sig_enforce=1 get signed somewhere ...
[09:38:05] <Dagmar> ...and then you can just replace the entire kernel and modules
[09:38:27] <Dagmar> ...but the device will almost certainly fail SafetyNet checks
[09:38:27] <lockywolf> Dagmar, well, there is that "SafetyNet" stuff, and such
[09:39:16] <Dagmar> SafetyNet specifically looks for things which can elevate the user to an unrestricted context
[09:39:29] <Dagmar> It's _fine_ with Lineage's signing
[09:39:30] <labrador> i do not really care about that,its all a sham,you are a lot more likely to be hacked remotely.
[09:40:07] <lockywolf> I have actually added a few Magisk modules, which seem to trigger SafetyNet
[09:40:26] <Dagmar> Some will.
[09:40:49] <lockywolf> I never suffered from that though, as no apps I needed really required to pass that check
[09:40:55] <Dagmar> I should refine something I said earlier
[09:41:11] <Dagmar> The point of it is to verify that no one can screw with the security model _right now_
[09:41:27] <Dagmar> Within certain limits, you can do whatever the hell you like to the filesystem and it won't care.

[10:53:47] <lockywolf> 欢迎使用
[10:55:50] <labrador> lockywolf, everything should be implemented in the client
[10:55:57] <labrador> the protocol should be simple
[10:56:05] <lockywolf> labrador, this means that you need a reference implementation of a clinet
[10:56:08] <lockywolf> *client
[10:56:10] <labrador> lockywolf, no
[10:56:13] <lockywolf> yes
[10:56:14] <labrador> you need specs
[10:56:21] <labrador> Of what a client should implement
[10:56:22] <lockywolf> you need UI specs
[10:56:29] <labrador> not UI specs
[10:56:33] <labrador> normal specs
[10:57:07] <lockywolf> Like "if there is a message that is only a URL, and it is pointing to an image, fetch that image, create a thumbnail, and display it to the user"
[10:57:15] <labrador> lockywolf, please no
[10:57:17] <lockywolf> this _must_ be in the spec
[10:57:20] <labrador> I don't want that tracking
[10:57:28] <labrador> That is bad feature
[10:57:29] <lockywolf> then you can use defective clients
[10:57:34] <labrador> Let a link be a link
[10:57:40] <lockywolf> no that is you not understanding the spec
[10:57:41] <labrador> To only be opened on user command
[10:57:42] *** Quits: Betal (~Betal@user/betal) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[10:57:57] <lockywolf> you can use a defective client, which ignores this feature
[10:58:13] <labrador> the other way is the defective way
[10:58:15] <labrador> not mine
[10:58:24] <lockywolf> but it must be clear that if the images are not visible, it is not a protocol failure, it is a property of the client

[16:19:12] <chilvers1> royaljelly: it wouldn't that's the point, so without deleting the files within the directory it would not perform the bookkeeping that decrements the inode's reference count, which means that file would never be removed and the space never freed up (since it will always have a count greater than 0)
[16:19:18] <Blondie101010> how would you otherwise access those files or even know they exist?
[16:19:35] <royaljelly> chilvers1: yeah, but what if that isn't a problem for me?
[16:20:02] <Blondie101010> it would be because your OS would not know where to get the files from
[16:20:10] <chilvers1> royaljelly: unfortunatly your stuck without modifying the kernel / tools to ignore that check since by default they want to prevent users from breaking their file systems
[16:20:21] <jacekowski> Blondie101010: you can open files by inode

[17:45:07] <Paddy_NI> Hey does anyone here know how to clone a 120gb drive (ssd, windows oem install) to a larger 480gb ssd and have the extra space?  I have already performed a direct disk to disk clone using clonezilla which boots and works splendidly. Sadly it only shows as a 120gb drive.
[17:45:39] <Paddy_NI> I am certain I have done this before I just for the life of me cannot remember how.
[17:45:40] <Psi-Jack> For reference, right now I've used Enpass for yeaaaars, which syncs up to a NextCloud data storage backend. I'm grandfathered in to use it free for life basically, while new people are required to subscribe to it.
[17:45:43] <Common-Lisp> Psi-Jack: I've never had issues with BitWarden
[17:45:49] <Common-Lisp> compared to LastPass, bitwarden works very well
[17:45:55] <Psi-Jack> Common-Lisp: You've tried a very limited number of password managers. 🙂
[17:45:57] <koollman> Paddy_NI: for windows, or linux ? windows makes it easier
[17:46:02] <Paddy_NI> The clonezilla channel here on libera seems a little dead.
[17:46:04] <Common-Lisp> Psi-Jack, true. I've tried 3.
[17:46:37] <Paddy_NI> koollman: (windows oem install)
[17:46:46] <Common-Lisp> Well, 4 if you include pass(1), but I only use that in limited circumstances.
[17:46:53] <Psi-Jack> Common-Lisp: I've done KeePass, KeePass 2, KeePassX, KeePassXC, Enpass, LastPass, BitWarden, and heck, many others that were directly associated with NextCloud plugins, etc.

[17:47:46] <Common-Lisp> hmmmmmm
[17:47:56] <Psi-Jack> LastPass was nice, in fact, I'd go as far to say it was better than BitWarden at everything except where you can host it (but, that said, all data between you/lastpass is 100% securely encrypted, including communication and storage of data).
[17:48:08] <hexnewbie> Paddy_NI: What does ‘gdisk -l /dev/sdx’ and  ‘fdisk -l /dev/sdx’ say about it?
[17:48:10] <Paddy_NI> I suspect it is to do with the layout of the HP windows installation.  Recovery partiton at the end etc
[17:48:13] <Common-Lisp> Psi-Jack: I didn't realize we were counting Keepass2, Keepassx, and Keepassxc as different
[17:48:24] <Paddy_NI> hexnewbie: Just a sec
[17:48:31] <koollman> Paddy_NI: seems strange. the free space should be visible in disk management
[17:48:34] <Psi-Jack> 1Password is good in adding additional things to what I have with Enpass now... Mostly family sharing options.
[17:48:35] <Common-Lisp> I left lastpass for bitwarden because lastpass charges for too much
[17:48:40] <nomagno> They are different
[17:48:45] <Psi-Jack> Common-Lisp: They are, integration-wise.
[17:48:53] <Paddy_NI> koollman: I suspect it just laid the partiton table atop the new drive
[17:48:54] <Psi-Jack> Common-Lisp: Only integration-wise, though.

[19:03:40] <neoncortex> One thing I curious, and I don't know exactly what happened, but on Debian 10 you could run containers by simply: lxc -n container_name.  Now, you need a whole Systemd wrapper, with a syntax on par with Java in terms of awfulness.
[19:03:42] <stanrifkin> in sysvinit you "could" boot into Single user mode and repair some lines

But to consider it up when it connected, and back down when it disconnected, so that auto-restart works, means you have a lot of scripting to support it

[20:34:29] <stanrifkin> eson123: could be an bug
[20:34:43] <eson123> i did try Windows 10, also acted the same as Linux
[20:34:56] <eson123> in fact it happened first on Windows, so i thought it was because of WIndows's driver and tried to switch to Linux
[20:35:00] <eson123> and now it happnes too :(
[20:35:28] <eson123> actually not really, the dmesg messages does change a little bit if i switch to another board
[20:35:33] <eson123> even tho eventually it results in an error

My situation: I manage various github accounts , and I'm using (yes of course) Linux CLI to push some repositories . The issue is that I got my git configured to `Username1` but I want to push now onto `Username2` and I'm basically doing `git push git@github.com:Username2/Username2.github.io` Obviously as
[23:23:12] <fakuve> I don't have authentified this user locally it gives me an error such as `ERROR: Permission to Username2/Username2.github.io.git denied to Username1` What would you do in my case?
[23:23:14] <martti> Guest7348: I've been there in the past. Linux' OOM can be called manually by holding down alt+printscr and pressing f and consider adding some swap space to your system. maybe get more memory or close a few tabs, turns out you don't need all of them.
[23:23:24] <ghostbuster> Guest7348: what browser do you use? it's either going to be one specific tab/site blowing up your cpu, or an addon/extension
