[00:01:18] <tali713> I know this is all cl-loopish style but I don't understand why not (while (string-match ... start) (setq start (match-end 0)) (add-to-list results (match-string 0) ...)  It seems simpler and more direct.  I'm sure I'm missing something obvious.

It just seemed weird to me to not use a form which makes it easy to "loop" through a string but starting at the end of prior match, rather than loop which is at least seemingly designed to loop over all elements in a set sequentially.

[01:38:14] <acdw> lol
[01:38:22] <rpav> some milk bread recipe iirc
[01:38:28] <acdw> yeah bread as a whole is the easiest thing in the world. flour water salt yeast
[01:38:30] <acdw> that's it
[01:38:41] <acdw> if you're patient, just flour water salt
[01:38:47] <acdw> since the yeast is there already
[01:38:48] <rpav> no real kneading i think and it still came out really soft/fluffy with minimal prep (i.e. no overnight)
[01:39:26] <acdw> oh niceeee
[01:39:55] <acdw> i was pretty floored when i found out kneading is just a time-saving device. like you don't have to knead any bread
[01:40:03] <acdw> people just do b/c it speeds gluten development
[01:40:12] <acdw> but if you wanna hang out, it'll develop on its own
[01:41:12] <tali713> oats: yeah, that's what happens when you need properly, you get larger holes and a chewier bite.  Store bought bread is rarely that.  Even many bakery breads I encounter are poor imitations because they didn't kneed correctly.  and what acdw said, you need to develop a feel for it.
[01:41:20] <rpav> https://kimchimari.com/milk-bread-asian/ <- ah right we used a mixer to knead 
[01:41:50] <oats> tali713, gluten development, I'm guessing?
[01:42:02] <hodapp> hm, I should make another loaf of salt-rising bread
[01:42:03] <tali713> acdw: yup, yeast is everywhere.  But you can get a head start by making a starter, still only needs flour water and salt (that sprinkle of sugar can speed up your starter.
[01:42:14] <hodapp> maybe I'll just so sourdough though.
[01:42:17] <hodapp> s/so/do/
[01:42:18] <tali713> oats: yeah, you are mechanically changing the gluten, exactly.
[01:43:56] <tali713> and it's important to note, you follow the recipe, let it rise, and bake it and you'll end up with bread, and homemade bread is good.  But it might not have the bite you want.  But it really is forgiving, you won't ruin it that easily.
[01:44:10] <rpav> beer also good .. a bit expensive per loaf tho
[01:44:16] <johnjay> tali713: speaking of bread lore, i've been wondering what happens if you allow the bread dough to pre-soak or whatever
[01:44:26] <johnjay> where you just mix the water and flour and let it "hydrolyze" or something for an hour first
[01:44:39] <johnjay> i tried it and the result was flatter and denser. so idk
[01:44:46] <tali713> dunno, sounds like a job for science.
[01:45:13] <johnjay> the trick with homemade bread is to moisten the top or else put water in an iron skillet in the oven
[01:45:21] <johnjay> otherwise the crust comes out to hard at least for me

[01:46:25] <johnjay> it's also possible i'm just overcooking it

[01:46:58] <tali713> johnjay: eggwash is certainly used, for some breads, i haven't heard anything about egg whites, but when I worked in a bakery (counter not ovens), most of the bread was flour (different flours) water and salt, maybe a pinch of sugar for the yeast starter.

[01:47:56] <acdw> johnjay: autolyse greatly helps gluten development and flavor

[01:48:57] <tali713> oh, right the one that uses bacteria instead of yeast
[01:49:08] <hodapp> acdw: welllll, it's something of an Appalachian thing from the US; it uses neither yeast nor sourdough nor eggs nor soda for leavening, as it uses Clostridium bacteria
[01:49:16] <acdw> johnjay: did you autolyse with yeast? b/c that could over-proof it probably
[01:49:19] <oats> I love that I was able to actually successfully pivot the channel to baking
[01:49:27] <acdw> hodapp: OOOOH I am in to this!! i'm from appalachia
[01:49:31] <acdw> but i've not heard of salt-rising
[01:49:50] <hodapp> its aroma is...... interesting, people perceive it as somewhere between "roasting swiss/emmentaler cheese" and "motherfucking dirty gym socks left in a sewer"
[01:49:59] <acdw> i mean, i think i'd like it
[01:50:05] <acdw> i like a yummy swiss cheese roasty
[01:50:45] <acdw> i thought i'd heard of clostridium, isn't that genus also botulism?
[01:50:48] <hodapp> I made a quick DIY incubator for keeping the temperature needed for the starter, though it isn't that hard to do it other ways

[01:51:30] <tali713> acdw: don't worry about it.  yeah, you should be nervous, but follow the procedure correctly.
[01:51:55] <hodapp> they do seem to know that (1) no one has ever reported ill from this bread, (2) baking kills it off completely, (3) cultures isolated from a loaf don't ever appear to be the.... actual sickness-inducing variety
[01:51:56] <acdw> oh damn lol
[01:52:04] <acdw> oh right, didn't think about baking
[01:52:14] <hodapp> but: do follow the procedure, it is more paranoid than normal dough
[01:52:21] <tali713> acdw: also bochilism is less scary than people make it out to be.  It's really dangerous in desperate times with poor canning techniques.  bochilism may not taste like anything but bochilism toxin makes your tongue go numb, it's pretty obvious.

[01:53:06] <hodapp> when I have the culture going well, it is kind of nuts - to me it seemed to be twice as active as commercial yeast
[01:53:12] <acdw> oh wow!
[01:53:22] <hodapp> this might have just been from the temperature I incubated at
[01:53:35] <tali713> acdw: with any pickles/ferments, just be sure you understand the chemistry before you start modifying recipes.  I've had people get nervous, but humanity has been preserving food this way for eons.
[01:53:43] <hodapp> also, I had one loaf turn out awful because I overworked it in a mixer
[01:53:48] <hodapp> so definitely avoid that
[01:54:17] <hodapp> I still think salt-rising bread makes the best toast in existence, though
[01:54:25] <tali713> like some people go "oh no, I'm watching my salt, let's put less in the pickle."  the salt isn't just a flavor, it's creating an environment where only desirable things grow.

[01:55:45] <hodapp> I make sauerkraut and sourdough regularly
[01:56:11] <johnjay> hodapp: for me it's the opposite, when i've made sourdough cultures they fizzle out and start to mold
[01:56:12] <hodapp> used to do my own yoghurt
[01:56:16] <tali713> yeah, sauerkraut is lacto-bacilus right?
[01:56:16] <johnjay> so i took to just refrigerating them
[01:56:22] <hodapp> think so. sauerkraut is hella easy
[01:56:28] <oats> yogurt is ridiculously easy in an instant pot
[01:56:29] <hodapp> johnjay: opposite of what now?
[01:56:38] <johnjay> you said your sourdough cultures were crazily active
[01:56:49] <hodapp> johnjay: not sourdough, this was salt-rising
[01:56:51] <johnjay> maybe you just meant they develop faster in a recipe
[01:56:55] <tali713> hodapp: what I found amusing is kimchi is also lacto bacilus, and made of cabbage, but completely different end product.
[01:57:05] <johnjay> but when i try to do sourdough the starter molds within a week
[01:57:15] <hodapp> my sourdough leavens at their most active are still much less active than commercial yeast

[01:58:47] <hodapp> you'll taste it in other recipes that aren't fermented
[01:59:41] <tali713> hodapp: right, but ripe kimchi smells of leaf decay, which some people find very unpleasent, and others love it; just like stinky cheeses.

[02:00:20] <acdw> yogurt is easier than i ever thought it'd be
[02:00:36] <tali713> johnjay: oh people totally die of bochilism, but usually through ignorance or desperation.
[02:00:42] <johnjay> i assume if you add some citric acid it reduces the risk

[02:00:49] <hodapp> one of my favorite puerh teas - which someone gave me from China and I have no clue where in China they brought it - has that sort of lovely smell/taste of a forest floor damp with dew
[02:00:54] <hodapp> dunno how to describe it
[02:01:07] <acdw> mmmmmm sounds great
[02:01:08] <tali713> johnjay: like back in the depression it was more common, commercial canning was new and presumed safe, times were desperate, and even if it looked off you ate it.
[02:01:24] <johnjay> idk but if it tastes anything like kratom it'd probably make me vomit. stuff tastes like bad armpit odor
[02:01:29] <acdw> i've heard botulism is also much more likely in canned goods, b/c fermented environments are usually too salty or acidic for botulism to take hold
[02:01:34] <hodapp> what's also kind of funny is that botulism really only emerged when we started creating hermetically-sealed environments by way of canning

[02:02:15] <tali713> this is why we salt our pickles, it's not just for taste!
[02:02:22] <johnjay> that's why you can ferment vegetables safely with just some water and salt
[02:02:27] <hodapp> that and salt solutions quickly cultivate other cultures that grow too quickly to let botulism take hold

[02:02:55] <acdw> i seriously need to make pickles again. i tried once but i think the salt level was too low
[02:03:00] <johnjay> yes. the botulism is outcompeted in the capitalist free market by the lacto-bacillus, which quickly attains a monopoly
[02:03:09] <acdw> kraut i've done to great successs. but cucmber pickles were gross
[02:03:13] <acdw> LOOL
[02:03:28] <johnjay> acdw: you should shoot for a 2%-10% salt solution by weight. sea water is like 3% for reference
[02:03:39] <tali713> and if you did someting silly (like store garlic in oil), then you may also be at risk for botulism.  but again, botulism toxin has a distinctive numbing "taste".  you can check before downing a whole pot of bochilism chili.

[11:08:20] <andreyorst> and it gives me this weird thing #[128 "\300\301\302#\207" [apply aorst/paredit-fix-tmm #<subr paredit-forward-kill-word> nil] 5 nil nil]
[11:08:36] <alphapapa[m]> andreyorst: That weird thing is a byte-compiled function
[11:09:27] <andreyorst> yeah, ideally I'd like to get this paredit-forward-kill-word from it so I could compare it with an element from the list of functions

[13:18:55] <judybot> wasamasa: The above strategy starts in the money (positive) as of the initial placing of tokens, an outcome you should not be surprised by. The same holds true for the next four steps, except in the case of Step 3. In Step 3 you effectively choose to ‘buy’ options in 3 of the 5 tokens available. This creates a trade-off that is worthy of comment.

[16:10:58] <makomo> e.g. it would allow me to do the following replace: "foo" -> "bar", "bar" -> "foo"
[16:11:19] <makomo> or other rotations such as "foo" -> "bar", "bar" -> "baz", "baz" -> "foo", etc.

[16:11:53] <makomo> see above ↑↑. might not be the best terminology, but i'm using it just like psetq uses it e.g.
[16:12:07] <makomo> in the sense that individual replacements (bindings) don't see each other's side-effects

[16:12:47] *** Joins: matsl (~matsl@gentoo/developer/matsl)
[16:12:52] <makomo> because you'd potentially end up stepping over your previous replacements
[16:13:55] <kilobug> makomo: that's relatively easy to implement if you can write a short elisp code, generate pseudo-random tokens that you are sure don't exist, replace all your original text with the tokens, then the tokens with the target text; but that method will require many walk through of the region/buffer so if it's large it wouldn't be very efficient
[16:14:10] <kilobug> makomo: I'm not aware of that already existing, but that doesn't mean much ;)
[16:14:36] <makomo> kilobug: i was wondering if i could avoid the pseudo-random token approach. a different implementation would be to walk the buffer only once, but stopping at every occurence of *one of* the potential matches
[16:14:56] <makomo> that's not that hard to do, but the thing is that i'd like it to support regexps as well, with the whole power of backreferences and \, expressions :'D

[16:15:37] *** Quits: tagomago (~anton@user/tagomago) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:15:44] <kilobug> makomo: there is also one potential issue, which is what happens if there is some overlap, ie if one of your token is "foo" and the other "oor" what should be with the word "foor" ?

[16:17:00] <makomo> kilobug: overlaps could be resolved either by taking into account the ordering of the replacements given by the user, or perhaps by taking longest matching regexps first. i like the first idea more, because it gives the user some wiggle room/power and avoids the potential performance issues with having to find longest matches 
[16:17:17] *** Quits: dschrempf (~dominik@070-207.dynamic.dsl.fonira.net) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[16:17:53] <makomo> so if given the replacements "foo -> bar" and "oor -> baz" and the text "foor", you'd get "barr", not "fbaz"
[16:18:06] <makomo> if you swap the order of the replacements though, then you'd get "fbaz", not "barr" :)
[16:18:15] <bpalmer> the simplest way that comes to my mind is elisp that does a search for "foo\\|bar\\|baz" and then checks a table to consult the replacement.
[16:18:29] <makomo> bpalmer: yes, in the case of plain strings. what about regexps?
[16:18:31] *** Joins: sera (~aya@82.22.254.21)
[16:19:10] <makomo> as soon as i combine multiple regexps into one, all of the capturing groups now share a single namespace and i have to do shifting of their indices, otherwise the replacements that use backreferences will be broken
[16:19:10] <bpalmer> same basic thing. First, you search for any of R1, R2, R3 ; then you iterate through R1 , R2, R3 in that order and see which one matched. Then insert the replacement.
[16:19:36] *** Joins: metal_egg (~metal0egg@pool-72-94-145-43.phlapa.fios.verizon.net)
[16:19:38] <makomo> aha, you weren't thinking of combining the regexps
[16:19:41] <bpalmer> The "any of R1, R2, R3" doesn't matter as far as capturing groups go
[16:19:57] <makomo> oh? what do you mean?
[16:20:00] <bpalmer> Well, R1\|R2\|R3  is exactly a regular expression, but you won't consult that for the replacements
[16:20:11] <makomo> hmmm
[16:20:57] <makomo> so i would be duplicating a little bit of work, right? once i find a match with this "mega-regexp", i'd have to apply each of the regexps again to find which one actually matched
[16:21:09] <bpalmer> yes.
[16:21:13] <makomo> that was another one of my ideas, but i wanted something better if possible :'D
[16:21:49] <bpalmer> note that the procedure actually is ambiguous, so you'd have to decide what to do if multiple regular expressions match.
[16:22:16] <bpalmer> e.g., if you have the regular expressions "a*b" and "ab*" , and you end up at "ab" , which one do you use?
[16:22:29] <makomo> yes, i mentioned that above. two options that come to mind are resolving it according to the precedence of the regexps, or according to the length of the match
[16:22:41] <bpalmer> I see, I missed that.
[16:22:47] <makomo> i like the first one more though :)

[16:23:20] <makomo> the idea with shifting the indices of the capturing groups would work, but for that i would need to parse the regexps in order to see how many capturing groups they have, and i would also need to somehow parse and modify the replacements, so that they now refer to the correct indices

[19:17:36] <djm> Here's how I remember it: "2" has a line along the bottom, so it's split-window-below; "3" looks like it has three things to hook into the side of something, so it's split-window-right
[19:17:41] <djm> Stupid, but it works

[19:18:56] <acdw> lol that's great djm
[19:19:20] <alphapapa[m]> djm: You also just taught me that split-window-below is an alias for split-window-vertically, which helps, because I think of splits in terms of the line between the buffers, so split-window-vertically seems to split horizontally to me.  Thinking of it in terms of split-below helps.

[20:24:04] <CuriousErnestBro> yessss
[20:24:05] <CuriousErnestBro> it works
[20:25:04] <makomo> hm, i can't seem to bind C-j in minibuffer-local-map. is there a reason for this?
[20:25:39] <CuriousErnestBro> thank you!!! twb :D
[20:26:09] <makomo> or rather, it does get bound, but when i drop into the minibuffer to eval an expression, pressing C-j inserts a newline (i unbound C-j from the read-expression-map first)
[20:27:25] <CuriousErnestBro> this is how it looks like
