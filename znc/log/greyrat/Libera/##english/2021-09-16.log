[00:12:56] <lall-> Doesn't seem like it is. though, i'm a dummy when it comes to English.
[00:14:26] <Loshki__> twomoon: In "there are missing parts" it clearly is. So I think it is in your phrase, as it serves the same function. But note that I'm a native speaker, and so cannot be trusted with grammatical issues.

[00:18:22] <huf> trust is the color of death
[00:19:01] <twomoon> "do you have any parts missing" is this also an adjective?

[00:20:01] <huf> it's a quote!
[00:20:30] <Loshki> If you say "do you have any parts that are missing" it looks a bit more obviously like an adjective
[00:20:38] <huf> https://library.tarvalon.net/index.php?title=The_Color_of_Trust
[00:20:58] <twomoon> yeah it has to be an adjective
[00:21:08] <twomoon> it's weird because the adjective comes after the noun
[00:21:54] <lall-> well talk about obscure.
[00:22:11] <huf> the wheel of time isnt terribly obscure
[00:22:21] <huf> fairly popular fantasy book series

[00:23:36] <TechTest> what color is trust?
[00:23:45] <huf> oh come on. death.
[00:23:56] <TechTest> ah right 
[00:23:57] <lall-> yeah but you've been throwing these non sequitors ever since i joined, maybe you're just in a mood. 
[00:24:22] <lall-> or maybe i have wrong impression.
[00:24:27] <huf> citation needed ;)
[00:24:48] <TechTest> non sequitors is equivalent to non sense?

[00:24:59] <lall-> <huf> it's happy
[00:25:10] <huf> those all had context
[00:25:18] <huf> I even explained
[00:25:22] <lall-> nah. i had to ask additional questions to figure it out
[00:25:25] <TechTest> what's "manhole"?
[00:25:41] <huf> AND I refrained from telling you that manhole is worse than manslaughter because holes are inherently feminine in our society :D
[00:25:59] <huf> TechTest: round hole in the street where people can go below

[00:26:57] <huf> well they're holes for men, arent they? :D
[00:27:16] <huf> as opposed to holes for effluence
[00:27:59] <huf> sewers are a series of holes, so you have to distinguish between the types
[00:28:55] <lall-> the manhole is an entrance to the tubes
[00:28:58] <TechTest> so women can't get in there?
[00:29:01] <lall-> no

[00:29:14] <TechTest> actually who would want to get in there?

[00:30:03] <lall-> lol
[00:30:06] <TechTest> actually I would want to get in there

[00:30:36] <TechTest> probably these things are pretty bad
[00:30:50] <TechTest> and anything that's bad has something to do with dicks
[00:30:53] <huf> look, someone has to go in there
[00:31:02] <huf> to keep our surface world nice and not too terribly smelly
[00:31:06] <huf> and to keep cholera down

[01:35:44] <huf> dogs have human eyebrows
[01:35:59] <huf> cats have fairly rigid faces, they communicate differently
[01:36:23] <lall-> they are more stoic. they dont show emotions like dogs do, separation anxiety etc
[01:36:25] <LjL> lall-, "Mothers will bring back dead or live prey to their kittens to teach them how to hunt" - it's a standard behavior, only they are considering us the inept ones like their kids
[01:36:53] <LjL> my cat showed anxiety just fine
[01:36:57] <LjL> poked a hole in his fur
[01:37:00] <huf> yes, they treat us as both mother and kitten and something new
[01:37:04] <huf> it's a weird mix

[01:37:48] <huf> they come to you when they are hurting and dont know how to solve it

[01:38:46] <huf> it really is just that dogs have human eyebrows
[01:38:54] <huf> their lower face is of course different
[01:38:56] <lall-> well look into his eyes... looks like a baby, and it'snot eyebrows, it's the eyes
[01:39:01] <huf> but they do all the eyebrow stuff we do

[01:41:25] <lall-> there's a distinct difference in looks and behavior between dogs and cats. Cats seem more smart, and calculated and cold... and dogs look childish and simple
[01:41:41] <huf> I grew up with cats and eventually I gained wisdom, but even as a kid I remember that I was never scratched by a cat unless I did something wrong
[01:41:56] <huf> like, I dont have any memory of a cat hurting me out of the blue
[01:42:13] <lall-> me neither. i do havea memory of mycat scratching mydogs face though.
[01:42:21] <TimMc> haha same
[01:42:23] <huf> cats have scratched me, yes, but I deserved it
[01:42:42] <LjL> deserved it by not understanding their nuances?
[01:42:45] <huf> except once when this current cat slid off my lap and grabbed my collarbone
[01:42:46] <huf> with a nail
[01:42:57] <huf> that was a reflex and an accident
[01:42:57] <TimMc> We had a rather horrible experience a couple years ago when we were attacked by a cat at a friends' house. We still don't know why. It was *furious*.
[01:43:13] <huf> but god dammit it hurt :D
[01:43:48] <huf> LjL: deserver it by being a small child who had no patience for cats
[01:43:55] <huf> and chased them with brooms
[01:44:04] <lall-> I admire cats reflexes and speed. The nails sharp are just a bonust for them.
[01:44:05] <LjL> cat here leaped to scratch (with only partial success) because someone dared take his empty bowl, which had to be done sneakily and in absolute silence or he'd get mad, even though it was... empty
[01:44:12] <huf> even then they were fairly nice about it
[01:44:13] <huf> really
[01:44:16] <huf> didnt blind me
[01:44:29] <huf> so cats are on the whole quite nice
[01:44:45] <LjL> lall-, don't forget the teeth. they are sharp af too
[01:44:49] <lall-> They are, my thought is that it's calculated nice.
[01:44:55] <huf> eh, nah
[01:45:01] <huf> get a cat
[01:45:01] <lall-> And dogs are just dumb... nice. 
[01:45:14] <lall-> i grew up in a village, had cats and dogs.
[01:45:20] <lall-> took care of all of them.
[01:45:26] <huf> yeah but did you have one sleep on you?
[01:45:26] <lall-> i'm not hating on cats
[01:45:34] <lall-> no. they lived outiside.
[01:45:35] <huf> I dont think it's calculated
[01:45:36] <huf> it's just cats
[01:45:48] <LjL> but when i'm minding my own business a dog may, and often has, threatened me... that only happened once with a cat, and it was weird
[01:45:56] <huf> well yes, they're a lot more wild than basically any other common animal we keep
[01:46:12] <huf> so they'll be different when they live outside
[01:47:01] <huf> dogs started following bands of hunting/herding humans a long long time ago
[01:47:04] <lall-> The dog lived outside too. It's basically a small village and all the families that had dogs were mostly hunting dogs, these animals were not treated as babies and toys in condos being pushed around in strollers 
[01:47:14] <huf> cats wandered in when we started agriculture and cities
[01:48:59] <lall-> i mentioned this a month ago. my gf took my 2 yr old daughter to some open zoo thing, and there's a window separating the area where the visitors are from the cats
[01:49:07] <lall-> and this cat charged toward my daughter to snatch her
[01:49:14] <lall-> i wasn't there. 
[01:49:43] <lall-> but i can see it. and i don't thinkt that domestic cats are much different than wild cats. they just know they're outnumbered.
[01:50:10] <lall-> but again, i know this is specific, it'snot something that you can draw general conclusions from
[01:50:27] <huf> they're different in that they're a species that's small
[01:50:28] <huf> not big
[01:50:33] <huf> that's a hell of a difference
[01:51:06] <lall-> i got attacked by a monkey once... he stole my kids bottle from the golf cart and i went toward him
