[10:32:49] <FromGitter> <magthe:tchncs.de> The Haskell LSP (HLS) supports evaluation of doctest-like comments ‚òùÔ∏è ‚èé I run the evaluation by clicking on the "Refresh"/"Evaluate" on the right with the mouse. I'd really like to use the keyboard though, but I can't figure out how :(
[10:38:32] <FromGitter> <magthe:tchncs.de> It's apparently a codelens, but searching for functions with that in the name doesn't reveal much :/
[10:54:28] <FromGitter> <osan:kde.org> is it me or does `execute-extended-command` in compleseus not use savehist?
[11:17:49] <FromGitter> <AreTaro> good to know, thank you. I will try
[14:18:58] <FromGitter> <milochadam> `(setq confirm-kill-emacs 'yes-or-no-p)` sounds like it would work
[15:23:35] <FromGitter> <yyoncho> @magthe:tchncs.de `M-x lsp-avy-lens`
[17:21:08] <FromGitter> <hariseldon78> not sure why, this is still no asking any confirmation
[17:28:08] <FromGitter> <hariseldon78> the funny thing is that the description is prompt-kill-emacs, in contrast with the `spc` `q` `Q` which is just kill-emacs
[17:28:19] <FromGitter> <hariseldon78> but they both do the same thing
[17:33:11] <FromGitter> <milochadam> Hmmm... maybe unbinding `SPC q q` would work?
[17:33:15] <FromGitter> <hariseldon78> at this point i'd be happy to just unbind it
[17:33:47] <FromGitter> <milochadam> You can always use `SPC SPC` or `C-x C-c` I think
[17:41:23] <FromGitter> <hariseldon78> ok, this was the only thing that worked, i guess spacemacs is changing something about the quit process and so the confirm-kill-emacs variable doesn't work
[17:41:57] <FromGitter> <hariseldon78> i was able to unbind the key with: `(spacemacs/set-leader-keys ‚èé  ‚èé ``` "qq" nil)```` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=61a23cacb5ba9e5a11dab437]
