[00:39:22] <sunjonSenghanBri> ...
[00:40:40] <Bowuigi[m]> It has planning for the future, it offers APIs for using it for extra stuff (like a build system or an RSS reader), it has a pretty easy to remember syntax, Emacs can render it on the fly, which removes the necessity of pandoc and a browser

[01:48:26] <M-elo-[m]> Ignore the `[...]` or missing info, I just typed it quickly like this for demonstration

[01:50:03] *** Quits: hB7drf (~quassel@user/hB7drf) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[01:54:54] <ii14[m]> remove `()`

[01:55:02] <dre> M-elo-[m], you're wanting the TT function to be joined in with your config object. you could either just define it in your config/init or there's some meta-table splicing that you can do, I think

[01:55:44] <M-elo-[m]> I assume creating an init and importing htem
[01:55:49] <M-elo-[m]> But don't know how to do it properly
[01:55:54] <ii14[m]> what do you mean by "works"?
[01:56:16] <ii14[m]> it will try to load a file from `lua/modules/term/config.lua`
[01:57:19] <M-elo-[m]> Well, the folder structure looks like: `config/config..files` without an init, so having the `local = require("modules.term.config")` won't call the proper file, right?
[01:57:28] <M-elo-[m]> Because there is no such file

[07:20:17] <jaawerth> dre: sure no worries, I only did it because I cant restrain mysearching-things impulse
[07:20:44] <zennmystic[m]> I no notice it return string all need do split
[07:20:46] <jaawerth> zennmystic[m]: sure - I mean the general idea is once you have your known sep you can use gsub or find + sub to slice and dice to your heart's content
[07:22:09] <jaawerth> zennmystic[m]: there's a vim.split convenience function btw, since lua doesn't have a builti one, you end up kinda haccking around with string.gmatch (which kinda works on its oown) or string.find+string.sub et al otherwise
[07:22:14] <zennmystic[m]> I not know much of lua still learn
[07:23:00] <zennmystic[m]> yes I do with string.gmatch

[07:30:36] <zennmystic[m]> I think I have enough help now maybe try write own plugin tomorrow!!
[07:30:43] <jaawerth> I'd help more but I'm falling asleep

[07:31:19] <zennmystic[m]> no no it good gavbe ne enough to try self tomorrow
[07:31:39] <zennmystic[m]> happy TY
[07:31:44] <jaawerth> https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/ is a good reference/eprier in addition to the lua manual btw. also `h vim.split` may also be useful

[20:14:33] <iago-lito[m]> I'm using vim as a merge tool with 4 diffed buffers. I would like to skip about like with `]c` but not "to the next change".. instead : "to the next change against buffer <N>". So for instance if there are 15 differences between bufnr 2 and bufnr 3 but bufnr 1 and bufnr 0 are identical on these lines, my command would directly skip to the first difference between bufs 1 and 0.. Any idea whether/how this could be achieved?
