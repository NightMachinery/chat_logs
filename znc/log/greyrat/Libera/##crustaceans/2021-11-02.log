[00:10:56] <ngoldbaum> on the one hand they think rms is a creep
[00:11:04] <ngoldbaum> on the other hand they use gemini
[00:11:31] <ngoldbaum> https://media1.giphy.com/media/MyzfERo9SqG1G/giphy.gif
[00:11:37] <imode> truly a middleground.
[00:12:32] <Brekkjern> I honestly feel like I need to take a shower since I touched gemini...
[00:13:10] <imode> what's your most and least favorite thing about it.
[00:13:41] <Brekkjern> Most favourite is that there was a library that could do all the things so I didn't really need to deal with it
[00:13:53] <Brekkjern> Least favourite being that it's fucking pointless.
[00:14:14] <imode> yeeeeeeeeeeeeeah.
[00:14:36] <Brekkjern> The only reason I did this was to add the favicon.txt support to bloat the standard
[00:14:37] <imode> it really is pointless, isn't i.
[00:14:49] <imode> *it
[00:14:55] <gerikson> well there is a point but it's very blunt
[00:15:53] <Brekkjern> It's so blunt it's nearly a perfectly flat plane
[00:16:22] <ngoldbaum> but like accessibility man
[00:16:36] <ngoldbaum> a blind person could write a parser in a weekend
[00:17:03] <gerikson> lol
[00:17:17] <Brekkjern> I don't get that argument
[00:17:32] <Brekkjern> I mean... How is that different from a gmi file served by HTTP?
[00:18:02] <Brekkjern> The only thing .gmi has over .md is that it is actually a defined standard
[00:18:06] <Brekkjern> That's pretty much it.
[00:31:00] <pja> We have had to wash the cat. Cat is ... not happy.
[00:31:27] <dimadima> can't imagine having to wash a cat
[00:31:43] <dimadima> i've been trying to aspirate my congested child for days now. can't imagine if he had claws
[00:31:51] <gwozniak> pja: oooo... sounds like a blast

[00:38:17] <gwozniak> indigo: one of our cats is pretty calm with trimming of her claws.  The other is downright awful about it.
[00:39:00] <indigo> Bummer.. can't do much about that though (I guess get them while they are sleepy?)
[00:39:18] <gwozniak> We have tried. She wakes up fast.
[00:39:23] <pja> Cat surprisingly unresistant. Not very happy, but not bitey about it.
[00:39:36] <gwozniak> If I hold her really well, we can do it.
[00:39:51] <pja> Claw trimming. oo. There’s a topic guaranteed to cause eruptions online.
[00:40:21] <pja> Ours is a very outdoor cat, so claw trimming is completely un-necessary. She does that herself.
[00:40:44] <pja> US peeps seem to be very averse to letting their cats outside though.
[00:41:25] <gwozniak> My sister's cat is an outdoor/indoor cat and that cat kills an awful lot of wildlife

[02:42:53] <martian67> where the fuck do these people come from
[02:42:53] <martian67> its incredible
[02:46:18] <dimadima> \/topic It makes perfect sense if you consider yourself not as a person but as a collection of electrical impulses floating around in your brain, though.
[02:46:32] <imode> chuck 'em in the meat grinder.
[02:46:35] <imode> they ain't human.
[02:46:55] <dimadima> they're collections of electrical impulses floating around
[02:46:58] <dimadima> same difference imode
[02:47:17] <dimadima> Computers are the same thing, they just transmit those electrical impulses millions of times faster.
[02:47:38] <dimadima> they're the same thing, just faster
[02:47:49] <dimadima> ✅
[02:47:50] <imode> they're fucking aliens, man. like the tomato -> msg, acid, sugar people.
[02:48:05] <imode> "these two things look alike when blurred, therefore they are the same".
[02:49:10] <imode> we are just a pile of electrical impulses but I'm not going to use that to justify my crypto fantasies and say that humans suck and computers should be in control of everything (that are running human-generated programs..)
[02:49:54] <dimadima> > that are running human-generated programs
[02:49:59] <dimadima> not for long, hopefully
[02:50:29] <dimadima> what can't you justify by reducing humans to electrical impulses
[02:51:18] <imode> it's not the reduction but the complexity mismatch. my brain is more complex than the processor in the machine I'm typing this on.
[02:51:24] <imode> and more complex than a crypto node.
[02:51:41] <imode> much like a tomato is more complex than just 3 ingredients thrown together.
[02:52:03] <dimadima> i'd go further by saying the complexity is not particularly relevant
[02:52:13] <dimadima> if your brain was less complex, that wouldn't matter to me either
[02:52:26] <dimadima> you brian, my brain, our brains
[02:53:07] <dimadima> i've has some "arguments" with a friend about AI and whether, if an AI produced a great poem or work of art, whether i'd value that
[02:53:14] <dimadima> had*
[02:53:18] <dimadima> personally i would not
[02:53:29] <dimadima> he would, he seems to have been saying
[02:53:42] <imode> depends on the "effort" put in.
[02:53:42] <dimadima> for me the human experience is what matters
[02:54:01] <dimadima> what do you mean by effort

[06:00:07] <cb_> [x] hat [x] job [x] no one cares
[06:00:36] <martian67> its hard to understand just how insane devo really was as a band these days
[06:00:39] <gwozniak> I don't listen to podcasts normally so I am basically guessing
[06:00:54] <martian67> what are you interested in gwozniak
[06:01:06] <martian67> do you like history, how long is the trip
[06:01:33] <gwozniak> history is good.  I've got about 40 hours of driving ahead of me
[06:01:49] <martian67> the history of rome is very good
[06:01:54] <martian67> and extremely fucking long
[06:02:04] <dimadima> martian67: i shill for mike duncan here all the time lol
[06:02:08] <martian67> much like, the history of rome...
[06:02:09] <dimadima> revolutions specifically
[06:02:17] <dimadima> but history of rome was excellent
[06:02:19] <cb_> gwozniak: i can't do podcasts, myself
[06:02:24] <cb_> so i would just blare some good shit music wise
[06:02:46] <martian67> history of philosophy is also very good (and very long)
[06:02:53] <gwozniak> I don't have music on my phone, and I mostly don't listen to music when driving
[06:02:55] <martian67> if that interests you

[06:03:10] <buttsbot> Revolutions
[06:03:22] <martian67> yeah i should listen to revolutions
[06:03:23] <dimadima> martian67: i've never heard history of philosophy. what's it like
[06:03:26] <gwozniak> cb_: I usually don't to podcasts either, but I do like a good talk radion show
[06:03:27] <martian67> i really like mike duncan
[06:03:31] <dimadima> revolutions is freakin A+
[06:04:06] <imode> "I don't care for it."
[06:04:10] <dimadima> i mean, some of them are hard to get into with so many characters/names, but great
[06:04:23] <dimadima> once you get to know the characters
[06:04:30] <dimadima> imode: care for what
[06:04:39] <imode> dimadima: what martian67 posted.
[06:04:41] <imode> crt stuff.
[06:04:45] <imode> hilarious.
[06:05:01] <gwozniak> I know one thing: I don't want to listen to tech stuff
[06:05:33] <imode> listen to the whole damn bee movie script.
[06:05:40] <dimadima> crt? i'm confused
[06:05:54] <imode> dimadima: https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1455242902091747336/pu/vid/720x720/4uZnxN_UL_8y6NLM.mp4?tag=12
[06:06:23] <dimadima> damn
[06:06:26] <dimadima> lol
[06:06:42] <dimadima> couldn''t muster a better answer than that, damn
[06:07:17] <dimadima> when ppl write CRT i seriously still think cathode ray tube like 2/3 times
[06:07:21] <imode> same.
[06:07:22] <martian67> gwozniak, i hear that lol
[06:07:25] <cb_> that's all it should be
[06:07:30] <martian67> most tech journalism is fucking awful anyways
[06:07:39] <gwozniak> martian67: the Rome thing might be worth it
[06:07:52] <martian67> its really good if rome has ever interested you
[06:07:56] <dimadima> it's pretty dope
[06:07:59] <dimadima> loved history of rome, too
[06:08:09] <gwozniak> I'll grab a couple movie related ones too, since I can listen to people chatting about film and be happy about it
[06:08:15] <martian67> there is a lot of people that aren't aware of most of the story
[06:08:39] <martian67> the idea that rome was invaded by barbarians and collapsed is pretty much false
[06:08:43] <gwozniak> I'm generally a fan of history and historical examinations, and I don't know much about Rome
[06:08:50] <martian67> barbarians *were* rome for centuries beforehand
[06:09:00] <gwozniak> I did know that was true, but I do not know the details
[06:10:48] <dimadima> you're driving w/ your sister you said? or did i make that up?
[06:11:03] <dimadima> if you're driving w/ someone that might be relevant
[06:12:01] <gwozniak> I'm driving her car, but by myself for a bit. My wife is flying to the ~halfway point and we're sharing the driving from there
[06:12:25] <gwozniak> She couldn't get off work for that long and wants to be a part of some of the road trip
[06:12:42] <dimadima> fun
[06:13:00] <dimadima> well pick something she might like :))
[06:13:25] <gwozniak> Maybe I should bring my "Learn Polish" CDs ;)
[06:13:49] <gwozniak> Since she has been trying to teach me for a while now
[06:13:49] <dimadima> i hope she's not lithuanian
[06:13:55] <dimadima> ah
[06:13:58] <gwozniak> She is, in fact, Polish :)
[06:14:33] <dimadima> i want to learn polish
[06:15:59] <dimadima> i once drove with a friend who played a mrs. dalloway audiobook
[06:16:09] <dimadima> which freaking killed me for some reason
[06:20:51] <gwozniak> I should really download everything I'm going to listen to because I suspect cell coverage will be spotty
[06:22:03] <dimadima> martian67: this thing? https://historyofphilosophy.net/
[06:22:04] <buttsbot> Home | History of Philosophy without any gaps
[06:22:13] <martian67> yes
[06:22:18] <dimadima> thank you
[06:22:21] <martian67> its excellent
[06:22:27] <martian67> also extraordinarily long lol
[06:22:37] <dimadima> any other recommends
[06:22:43] <martian67> hes on episode like 300 and only *just* reached the reformation
[06:22:49] <martian67> no
[06:22:52] <dimadima> perfect
[06:23:05] <dimadima> i've only gotten into 3 podcasts in my life; history of rome, revolutions, and in our time
[06:23:09] <martian67> his examination of arabic philosophy is also extremely good
[06:23:15] <dimadima> if a podcast is long/expansive, thats good
[06:23:24] <martian67> something thats often basicly a black hole of knowledge in western discourse
[06:23:24] <dimadima> that's great
[06:23:30] <dimadima> yeah i noticed it's got non-western shit
[06:23:37] <dimadima> which is excellent
[06:23:48] <martian67> islamic philosophy was a *critical* link between ancient and modern thought
[06:24:21] <martian67> the islamic world was as much an inheritor of roman and greek culture as "europe" was
[06:24:25] <dimadima> sure, i learned a bit about that from this IOT episode: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00dp4d8 :)
[06:24:25] <buttsbot> BBC Radio 4 - In Our Time, The Translation Movement
[06:24:36] <martian67> and the were the ones who bothered to preserve it (and expand upon it greatly)
[06:25:07] <martian67> if not for their efforts we would have almost no first hand accounts of ancient greece/rome
[06:25:22] <martian67> philisophical or otherwise
[06:25:23] <dimadima> the only thing that sucks about In Our Time is that they're one-off episodes; some expansive/comprehensive  is much more rewarding to me
[06:25:35] <dimadima> yeah
[06:25:53] <dimadima> i heard something about irish monks also playing a role in preserving antiquity
[06:26:00] <martian67> yeah its a podcast that rewards patient listening
[06:26:22] <dimadima> in the car what else am i going to do
[06:26:27] <dimadima> well sometimes i just think
[06:26:50] <dimadima> but a good podcast is excellent
[06:26:52] <martian67> but not *just* that of course, islamic thought had a lot of revolutionary ideas that pre-dated similar trends in europe by centuries
[06:27:05] <dimadima> yeah
[06:27:34] <martian67> rejection of metaphysics is a big one, al-ghazali came very close to identifying something like the scientific method
[06:27:40] <dimadima> i've hearda bout it; would like to get the details
[06:28:25] <dimadima> i want to read some freaking Bacon if we're talking scientific method
[06:28:33] <martian67> yeah he covers that too
[06:28:34] <dimadima> it's cool islam got there
[06:28:39] <dimadima> or almost there, much before
[06:28:53] <martian67> Ibn Khaldun is another good one
[06:28:58] <dimadima> some day i'll read some bacon i hope
[06:29:11] <martian67> he is perhaps the greatest philsopher almost nobody has ever heard of :)
[06:29:45] <martian67> he basicly singlehandly invented the concept of critical examination of history and cultural trends
[06:30:16] <martian67> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muqaddimah is an incredible and lucid work
[06:30:17] <buttsbot> Muqaddimah - Wikipedia
[06:31:01] <martian67> he might have beat smith to the punch in describing a free market economy by 300 years :)
[06:34:09] <dimadima> well i look forward to listening
[06:34:25] <dimadima> i'm almost caught up with revolutions
[06:34:35] <dimadima> i can't believe mike duncan isn't going to do more revolutions about russia
[06:34:50] <martian67> why not?
[06:34:53] <dimadima> i don't know
[06:35:02] <martian67> its a touchy issue, even today
[06:35:16] <dimadima> i don't think that's it
[06:35:26] <dimadima> but i guess i don't have any idea ctually
[06:36:26] <dimadima> i wonder what else he's goign to do
[06:36:33] <dimadima> if he does a podcast about baseball or something i'll be bummed out
[06:36:41] <dimadima> he likes sports and i don't really care about sports at all
[06:37:02] <dimadima> maybe he'll get me into baseball but i doubt that's possible
[06:38:17] <martian67> eh, the history of baseball is pretty facinating, even if you dont really care about sports imo
[06:38:25] <martian67> id be down to listen to that
[06:39:19] <dimadima> yeah for sure, but the ken burns docu would do it for me
[06:39:27] <dimadima> (i want to see that; someone mentioned it here the other day)
[06:41:44] <dimadima> like between mike duncan talking baseball and history of philosophy i'd probably listen to history of philosophy assuming it's a good podcast :)

[12:37:27] <gerikson> lol
[12:37:36] <gerikson> Foundation is a fixup of pulp-era stories
[12:38:20] <Brekkjern> I think it's pretty decent so far, but I haven't read the books so I have no way to compare it with the  source material.
[12:38:28] <Brekkjern> But as a work of its own it stands up
[12:38:35] <gerikson> yeha don't read the books
[12:39:27] <Brekkjern> Of all the classical sci-fi I have read, the only book that really was any good was Dune TBH
[12:39:34] <gerikson> ``Some adaptation is appropriate, as a lot of the pulp fiction scifi from that area has characters doing ridiculous things like using tape drives.''

[12:45:34] <gerikson> I mean if you enjoy SF
[12:45:44] <gerikson> ``This sums up my feelings about the show pretty well. Loved the books, hated the show. It gets rid of everything that was interesting about the books - the high level narrative about civilization and power projection mechanisms and replaces it with generic Hollywood sci-fi tropes, with cringy romance subplots thrown in. The second episode was so bad I stopped watching.''

[16:51:25] <gerikson> ok now I've downloaded Foundation
[16:51:34] <gerikson> and his first novel Pebble in the Sky
[16:51:36] <dimadima> beej's guides look great. he also has a network programming guide iirc
[16:51:53] <gerikson> dimadima: ugh forcing someone to read
[16:52:30] <dimadima> gerikson: yes. and they were russian so they were working on knowledge based on how books were translated into russian
[16:52:50] <dimadima> so, like, tom sawyer in russian was translated readbly for kids who were in 2nd grade
[16:53:14] <dimadima> but in 1992 the original english might as well have been a different language for a kid who wasn't particularly interested or experienced
[16:53:37] <dimadima> used the word "lick" like to beat someone up, and i was like "why are they licking each other?"
[16:53:49] <dimadima> "what is with these people?"
[16:56:18] <gerikson> haah
[17:01:34] <dimadima> i'll be interesting to see what it's like growing up now with the internet

[17:19:27] <gerikson> Brekkjern: book
[17:19:39] <gerikson> the dude I share a seedbox with has downloaded the series tho :D
[17:24:28] <ngoldbaum> foundation is pretty meh as a novel
[17:24:37] <ngoldbaum> also the apple tv series is somehow even more meh
[17:25:37] <gerikson> ngoldbaum: yeah I tried listening to it as audiobook years ago and had to give up
[17:26:27] <ngoldbaum> also the series follows the dune principle
[17:26:30] <ngoldbaum> first book is best
[17:26:34] <ngoldbaum> second book is ok
[17:26:39] <ngoldbaum> third book is trying too hard
[17:26:55] <ngoldbaum> all further books are garbage fanservice cashgrabs
[18:09:31] <gerikson> ngoldbaum: Foundation?
[18:09:43] <ngoldbaum> yes
[18:16:26] <indigo> I like the show; as for the books I agree with the exception that I thought the second book was the best
[18:21:33] <Geekingfrog> I believe Asimov wasn't keen on writing more after the 3rd book, but ultimately gave to the pressure from the fans and the publishers after many years.
[18:24:02] <gerikson> it must have been a massive cash source
[18:24:11] <gerikson> and he needed to party with teens
[18:25:50] <gerikson> JFC this Trojan source stuff is irritating, I'm seeing people running around like healdess chickens and other people are saying it's a prior-art nothingburger
[18:25:51] <indigo> Right, wasn’t he a chronic womanizer?
[18:26:44] <indigo> gerikson: yeah it didn’t seem too bad to me
[18:27:08] <indigo> Some computer security researchers trying to get their five minutes of fame
[18:27:29] <gerikson> ``The Washington Post's "Book World" section reports of Robots and Empire opined "In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are."''
[18:29:31] <gerikson> no wonder HN likes him
[18:30:37] <indigo> I think if you’re reading Asimov for the characters, you’re gonna have a bad time
[18:34:33] <companion_cube> or for the writing
[18:46:45] <ngoldbaum> the reason foundation doesn’t have strong women characters is he literally thought including women in sci-fi was creeping communism
[18:48:47] <gerikson> well he'd have loved teh Sad Puppies then

[23:05:30] <buttsbot> Twitter - kerckhove_ts - If anyone is looking to get hired as a software engineer/tester writing Haskell/Nix, they can send me their factorio savef...
[23:06:34] <imode> solid idea. let me whip up a savefile using a savefile editor.
[23:06:55] <Brekkjern> It's not about the progression, but the base design
[23:07:09] <Brekkjern> I'd bet they would accept something made in creative mode too
[23:07:22] <imode> it's a dumb idea.
[23:07:30] <Brekkjern> Why?
[23:08:06] <imode> because there's little similarity between factorio and software engineering, despite everyone wanting there to be similarities.
[23:08:06] <Brekkjern> It's not like they don't still do regular interviews and evaluate technical competence
[23:08:16] <prussian> but what if I can't write haskell like a pro?
[23:08:26] <imode> like a pro(tm)
[23:08:28] <drakonis> lmfao
[23:08:31] <prussian> what imode said
[23:08:33] <Brekkjern> ™
[23:08:34] <prussian> i forgot the tm
[23:08:35] <prussian> ya
[23:08:40] <drakonis> i'll go play factorio again
[23:08:48] <drakonis> but with angels/bobs instead of vanilla
[23:08:51] <Brekkjern> Alt + 0153 for ™ if you're on Windows :P
[23:08:54] <drakonis> now that's going to get me hired instantly.
[23:09:06] <Brekkjern> drakonis: bobs + angels + LTN is just the best
[23:09:37] <imode> it's about like saying "go send me a sketch in logisim to prove you're a good software architect". yeah I'll be impressed but solving the wire crossing problem isn't exactly on the list of requirements here.
[23:10:26] <imode> I say this as someone with actual digital logic design exp.
[23:14:13] <prussian> it's probably just spur of the moment twitter baiting
[23:14:21] <prussian> probably nothing more to really read into
[23:14:46] <Brekkjern> Yep
[23:14:59] <Brekkjern> It's probably also a decent icebreaker for candidates
[23:15:15] <imode> gotta love twitter bait.
[23:18:52] <kline> hire-by-factorio is just "i want to see how you design big systems but i dont want to have to read and understand code"
[23:18:56] <kline> "give me something pretty"
[23:19:27] <kline> obvious implication: you might be able to wire-chart a system, but it doesnt say shit about if you can actually write implementations, debug, use the tools, etc
[23:20:04] <imode> it doesn't even really test your abstract thinking either.. you can't shim away details in factorio.
[23:20:24] <imode> everything is flat-ish.
[23:20:32] <Brekkjern> You can, but you need the Factorissimo mod for it
[23:20:37] <riv> what if the job is literally just to solve a bunch of hard factorio levels?
[23:20:40] <riv> did you consider this?!
