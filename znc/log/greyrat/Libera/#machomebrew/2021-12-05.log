[00:10:12] <tarzeau> ok so i'm trying to create a brew: https://sid.ethz.ch/debian/fnt/brew/fnt.rb
[00:10:37] <tarzeau> but the make install part is broken. does brew have something like debian/install files ?
[00:12:36] <tarzeau> i could just say bin.install "fnt" ? and man.install "fnt.1" ?
[00:14:18] <tarzeau> indeed that worked :)
