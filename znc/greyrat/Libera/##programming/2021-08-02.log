[02:39:14] <blahboybaz> So why does javascript fire the function when an arg is missing in the function call?
[02:40:22] <All> because it doesn't know any better?
[02:42:06] <pulse> blahboybaz, because that's how JavaScript works. if you omit a function's parameter it will default to undefined
[02:42:25] <blahboybaz> wierd
[02:42:32] <pulse> it's not weird, it's just how it works
[02:42:50] <pulse> a return value in JavaScript is similarly undefined unless something else is explicitly returned
[02:42:53] <Arahael> blahboybaz: lets just say that there are... reasons...  many devs don't like javascript :)  but typescript will help tighten some of thr static checks, but the catch is you then have to compile it (unless you use deno or something).
[02:42:54] <pulse> all functions return undefined

[02:44:39] <pulse> yeah. or you can define a function without parameters and run through the parameter list manually
[02:45:24] <cis> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments
[02:46:14] <cis> there's a special variable in every javascript function called arguments, which contains every argument, and is almost an array

[02:46:54] <cis> you can spread it into an array now, but in the old days you'd get to write Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments) if you wanted to iterate it.
[02:47:57] <cis> javascript is not weird; it's absurd

[02:50:00] <blahboybaz> So Arahael Since ts and js are based on the same standard, does that mean you can integrate them together in one application and havwe some the application that is compiled (the ts part) and some that is not (the js part)?
[02:50:40] <Arahael> blahboybaz: i am not sure that ts and js are "based on the same standard", but yes, ts and js interoperate very well.

[02:50:48] <cis> yeah, you can configure typescript to allow js files, which is useful if you want to convert an old project one module at a time
[02:50:59] <cis> if you're starting from scratch, you probably should stick with one or the other
[02:51:02] <blahboybaz> Seems interesting
[02:51:46] <blahboybaz> I'm assuming that compiled language is faster than interpreted languag - so ts (copiled) faster than js (interpreted)
[02:52:00] <cis> it's compiled TO js
[02:52:08] <Arahael> blahboybaz: generally though, you'll still need to know javascript, it's a con of using additional languages: you end up needing to know all the languages that a project uses.
[02:52:28] <Arahael> yep: ts is compiled *to* js.
[02:52:33] <blahboybaz> right on
[02:52:33] <cis> the typescript compiler spits out javascript, which is then interpreted wherever its run
[02:53:09] <blahboybaz> I'm getting the hang of jest now - very happy about that
[02:53:13] <Arahael> and js is, despite the language, impressively fast due to the insane amount of man hours spent optimising it.
[02:53:28] <blahboybaz> right on
[02:53:51] <cis> well, it depends... some engines compile it
[02:53:52] *** Quits: kodah (~kodah@user/kodah) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[02:54:14] <Arahael> indeed.  notably ios apps don't compile it unless they are running it in safari :(
[02:54:36] <blahboybaz> If the interpreter for js is in the browser then where (and what) is the interpreter for node?
[02:54:50] <Arahael> blahboybaz: in node.

[08:56:30] <arahael1> Izem: Just skimmed it, it seems pretty specific to clojure and their particular methodology, it's... OK... for a database that is used only by that app and is internal to that app.
[08:57:12] <InPhase> Joanna: How about please stop accusing random people of trolling.  It runs counter to the respectful and friendly atmosphere we're trying to construct.  The others here are just conversing.
[08:57:37] <arahael1> Yeah - "trolling" is a very loaded term, and usually quite offensive to people on IRC.

[08:58:36] <Joanna> Izem: it’s their job..
[08:58:47] <arahael1> Guest78: That's not an unreasonable price, imho, depending on the audience and purpose of the spec.
[08:58:52] <Guest78> :(
[08:59:07] <Guest78> I fall on the side of abolishing the ISO :D
[08:59:09] <arahael1> Guest78: Consider that's generally way less than hiring someone for a month in most places.
[08:59:17] <InPhase> arahael1: It's unreasonable because this is a non-starter for most open source software.
[08:59:32] <Izem> InPhase: really?
[08:59:35] <Guest78> No, but the argument is that the ISO itself does not really do anything other than stamp their name over it
[08:59:38] <arahael1> InPhase: Yes, but arguably, does an open source application require that spec?
[08:59:53] <Izem> oh I see what you mean
[08:59:57] <All> the iso is so versatile, you can mount them like it was a real "hard" media
[08:59:57] <Guest78> The actual work is done by volunteers and people from other companies... much like the C++ committee does the actual work of drafting the spec

[09:04:18] <Izem> understandable, I probably won't come to a conclusion in 5 minutes or so
[09:04:47] <Guest78> Fair point
[09:04:50] <arahael1> InPhase: For an opensource product I'd also refuse to purchase it, but consider Linux and POSIX - the proper standard generally isn't that important.
[09:05:09] <InPhase> arahael1: Yeah, if I can work around it, like using the C++ draft, then I'm unconcerned.
[09:05:45] <Izem> on the other hand it's surprising to see that individuals have started projects like these ... that's almost insane
[09:05:48] <arahael1> InPhase: And that, is primarily my point.  The high cost of standards is mostly to fund the ISO (afaik), and is also mostly for regulatory crap such as being required by a govt or large company to be compliant.
[09:06:27] <Izem> yeah that's where I was coming from too

And I'm not sure if you can still access all of them.  It's probably only a subset yet that have drafts.

[15:16:00] <mrig> The thing that I'm appreciating most at the moment is that in filling in the picture a little as to how things can be done, it is far easier to then do things.

[16:47:14] <usr123> For a little context, I once spent 2 days (not straight, just in multiple sessions) to build a model, whereas my sister did it in half n hour.
[16:47:59] <pyzozord> usr123: faster at programming or faster at typing?
[16:48:08] <pyzozord> usr123: well doesn't matter, the answer to both is: practice!
[16:49:15] <usr123> pyzozord: Faster at programming. Getting faster at typing is what I would like to get. Getting faster at programming is what my employers would want me to get.
[16:49:48] <usr123> pyzozord: Practice how? Do I just build a lot of side projects? Read a lot of relevant documentation?

[16:54:03] <usr123> Arahael: I have, in past tried to use IDE's. And then I just sort of feel stuck, or I feel I'm unable to think looking at an IDE. I don't know if that's a problem with me or if that happens to some people.
[16:54:08] <Arahael> usr123: vim is most useful, imho, when I'm doing all sorts of text editing tasks - config files, sql, etcetera, but an IDE that is specialised for a particular role can be very effective and make some tasks quicker - at work where I am doing iOS dev, I tend to use XCode 90% of the time.

[20:37:08] <pyzozord> yeah that's part of it, that's one of the ways how you can pass the secrets inside the container. Docker env vars are a good way
[20:37:33] <Lyn> but is it good practice, I read somewhere that passing secrets as env vars isn't a good idea
[20:37:53] <Lyn> it was suggested that secrets be mounted (as files?) in containers
[20:38:19] <pyzozord> Yeah mounted filesystem is maybe even more secure?

When you and I get a new computer, we probably both shop online for the best one with the specs we want and order it.  But these are two very different consumer demographics, and our group is smaller.
[21:08:32] <InPhase> dan01: Moreover, even if you do go to buy a computer online, and you go to most sites, you will not see the Linux ones offered up front.  You have to know what you're looking for, because nobody is pushing them like android and chromebooks got pushed.
[21:08:44] <dan01> InPhase: Imagine Linux deprecated Xorg, OpenGL in favour of Vulkan and Wayland, and the had all the drivers and codecs, and a new UI
[21:09:03] <InPhase> It's really not driver issues.  Linux driver support seems to be pretty great now.

[21:38:16] <vdamewood> But my last tetanus shot was in 2014, so I'm good.
[21:38:27] <octav1a> This is kind of a strange combination of technologies so I'm not sure where to ask it. Anyway I'm writing numba/cuda, attempting to convert someone's code from python/numpy. There are some parts where a by-element array slice is used. (like n=[1,2,3] f = [1,1,0], n[f] should give [1,2] -- I'm trying to figure out the best way to replicate this type of functionality when in a kernel where no dynamic memory allocation is allowed.

[23:29:38] <Rashad> bihtori Short vowels (like the Fathah) are not always written in Arabic. vdamewood said Slam instead of Salam because the first 'a' vowel is not written in Arabic
[23:29:45] <Rashad> (unless you use a fatha...)
[23:29:58] <Rashad> so I used the fatha in conjunction with the English script
[23:30:15] <vdamewood> English Alphabet, Latin Script
[23:30:24] <bihtori> OK thanks for the info!
[23:30:37] <vdamewood> (But not English script)
[23:30:42] <Rashad> did I just assume your script
[23:31:32] <vdamewood> 'Script' reffers to the writing system as a whole. So English, French, and Turkish all use the Latin Script. While they each have their own 'Alphabet'.
[23:32:14] <Rashad> vdamewood do you know of the attempt a Lebanese guy did to make a script for "Lebanese" based on the Latin script?
[23:32:42] <vdamewood> Rashad: What's 'Lebanese'? Levantine Arabic?
[23:33:00] <Rashad> the lebanese dialect
[23:33:30] <bihtori> Rashad: This is how Putty renders it https://i.imgur.com/KY50hx8.png
[23:33:36] <vdamewood> Latin is missing just a few too many letters to be useful for Arabi.
[23:33:42] <vdamewood> Arabic
