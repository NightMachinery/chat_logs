[17:04:01] <fauno> hi o/ has the emacs fcc behavior changed? i upgraded from 0.32.1 to 0.33.2 and now it's storing sent email into a ~/sent mbox instead of ~/Maildir/sent/
[17:04:22] <fauno> i tried changing notmuch-fcc-dirs but it complains sent/ is not a regular file
[17:09:08] <bremner> fauno: at some point notmuch stopped overriding mail-user agent
[17:10:06] <bremner> yep, see NEWS under 0.33
[17:10:38] <fauno> bremner: i read that but i didn't get how it was related, thanks!

[17:12:22] <bremner> yeah, that's a bug in emacs, fixed in emacs 28. But you can use setq as a workaround
[17:19:45] <fauno> bremner: should it be `(setq mail-user-agent 'notmuch-user-agent)`?  nothing changed
[17:20:11] <bremner> did you restart?
[17:20:33] <bremner> also what is the major mode when composing?
[17:21:22] <fauno> yes i did. Message[Notmuch] MML Abbrev Fill
[17:23:17] <bremner> hmm. OK, maybe this is some other problem, unrelated to mail-user-agent.

[18:43:55] <natrys> Hello bremner, do you think this discussion could be revived: https://yhetil.org/notmuch/86a6k7hd43.fsf@gmail.com/T/#u
[18:44:07] <natrys> I am sure I won't be the last consult user to be tripped by this
[19:06:26] <fauno> bremner: database.path is ~/Maildir i don't have a mail_root
[19:13:10] <fauno> according to the docs the fcc folder is relative to the maildir, so it's ok it's sent and stores into ~/Maildir/sent, just after the upgrade it turned into ~/sent and became a file.  i remember asking me to create this because it didn't exist yet but just now i noticed i don't have any sent email in notmuch since (oct 14th)

[19:43:30] <bremner> fauno: what is the value of "notmuch-maildir-use-notmuch-insert" ?
[19:44:10] <bremner> also, I guess notmuch-emacs-version while you're looking
[19:45:17] <fauno> bremner: 0  use notmuch insert
[19:45:40] <bremner> 0? not t? that's a bit odd.
[19:45:51] <bremner> it shouldn't matter, just a bit unusual
[19:46:01] <fauno> Available choices:
[19:46:03] <fauno> 0 = Use notmuch insert
[19:46:05] <fauno> 1 = Use simple fcc
[19:46:23] <fauno> (this is emacs 27.2)
[19:47:28] <fauno> notmuch version 0.33.2
[19:48:44] <bremner> hmm. I don't know where 0 and 1 are coming from.
[19:49:55] <bremner> oh, maybe it's terminal vs. gui emacs thing.
[19:49:59] <fauno> it's t on ~/.emacs though
[19:51:02] <fauno> i run `emacs -nw -f notmuch` if it helps
[19:51:04] <bremner> yeah, it's just the way that emacs -nw displays in customize
[19:51:08] <bremner> ok
[19:54:32] <bremner> natrys: I don't think I can give feedback now; I was hoping that dme or Domo would follow up, since they seemed to have opinions in the other thread.  I guess that hasn't happened yet. I will eventually wade through the discussion.
[20:21:49] <bremner> fauno: I'm a bit out of ideas. Can you give me a recipe to reproduce the problem starting with "emacs -q"? You're using the default value for notmuch-fcc-dirs, so not much fiddling should be needed.
[20:28:42] <Domo> too long lines, didn't read >;/
