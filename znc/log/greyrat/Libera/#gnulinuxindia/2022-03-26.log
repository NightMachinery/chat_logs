[11:38:08] <relejek[m]> now i get to fegure out how i can integrate this with hugo ssb and make it live on my page.
[11:38:12] <AryaK[m]>  i dont even use twitter
[11:38:16] <AryaK[m]> i use only
[11:38:20] <AryaK[m]> mstdn
[11:38:36] <relejek[m]> Arya K:  lol, i said tweet.txt method. a microblogging method all comprised in a text file. 
[11:39:11] <relejek[m]> Arya K: it is not about twitter or mstdn. the idea is to tweet but everything is in a .txt file
[11:39:18] <relejek[m]> microblogging.
[11:39:42] <AryaK[m]> oh
[11:42:20] <relejek[m]> Arya K:  it is sort of like a tilde site. <base-url>/~user
[11:42:45] <labrador> or use misskey?
[11:42:54] <labrador> it looks super cool
[11:43:18] <relejek[m]> Arya K:  https://tilde.team/~g1n/twtxt.txt <- an example of twtxt
[11:45:31] <AryaK[m]> oh nice
[11:46:19] <relejek[m]> labrador:  i see that misskey is fedrated so you can interact with misskey users from your mstdn instance/account. noice
[11:46:52] <relejek[m]> federated with activity-pub*
[11:47:37] <labrador> relejek[m], its pretty different doe and not everything can be translated to activtiy pub so its better to have a misskey server
[11:47:55] <labrador> its ui itself looks so cyberpunkish

[16:27:34] <Prit[m]> But removing bloat works  by debloating my android I get way more battery life
[16:41:56] <Prit[m]> mpv has so many dependenciesüò∂
[16:45:12] <AryaK[m]> use vlc then :p
[16:48:01] <Prit[m]> It has even more...why I am I dowloading libraries of obscure filetypes like ogg opus aac flac that nobody uses
[16:48:32] <labrador> Prit[m], what?
[16:48:48] <labrador> everyone uses opus,ogg,aac,flac
[16:49:03] <AryaK[m]> +1]
[16:49:10] <AryaK[m]> ogg is used by the fsf
[16:49:44] <Prit[m]> Why can't we have 1 standardized format
[16:50:11] <labrador> ogg is a container format,opus,aac are codecs and flac i think is both
[16:50:26] <labrador> Prit[m], different ones do different things
[16:50:36] <labrador> are better at different things
[16:50:44] <labrador> and backwards compat

[16:50:53] <AryaK[m]> some arent free
[16:53:21] <labrador> yeh mp3v isnt the end all be all nowadays
[17:11:29] <labrador> you wanna know more about video/audio Prit[m]?
[17:19:23] <Prit[m]> I would like to know
[17:25:26] *** Quits: purpux (~purpux@user/purpux) (Quit: leaving)
[17:28:30] <labrador> Prit[m], ok so there's something called a container format which multiplexes streams
[17:28:51] <labrador> then the actual things being multiplexed are called codecs
[17:31:17] <Prit[m]> And to demultiplex it we need libraries of video players?
[17:32:02] <labrador> Prit[m], yeah there's certain libs that house demultiplexers for many formats,libs that house codecs for many formats
[17:33:19] <Prit[m]> So do we need multiplexer codecs in normal pcs or only servers?
[17:34:41] <labrador> Prit[m], well if you have ever wanted to transcode a file or copy a stream from mkv to ogg you need multiplexers
[17:35:02] <Prit[m]> Oh ok
