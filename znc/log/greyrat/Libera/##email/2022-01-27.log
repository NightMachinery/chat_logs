[00:08:23] <Khepra> jaybe: are these irc channels?
[00:09:03] <jaybe> I don't understand the question and I'm not going to respond to it
[00:09:18] <Khepra> what's a "twatter hashtag"? is it a type of crypto? hashes per second?
[00:11:35] * jaybe ðŸ”‚
[00:24:24] <ttys000> is 1024 still the advisable key length or should i do 2048?

[00:40:27] <tuxick> for what?
[00:48:16] <Khepra> DKIM
[00:48:33] <tuxick> dkim? i can't imagine anyone's going to burn even 2 electrons trying to forge your dkim record
[00:49:07] <tuxick> unless 1k key takes like a second
[00:50:38] <Khepra> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail#Short_key_vulnerability
[00:51:22] <tuxick> right, quite a bit more than 2 electrons
[00:52:02] <tuxick> but why not use 2k indeed
[00:52:28] <Khepra> indeed.
[00:53:18] <Khepra> or skip rsa-sha shenanigans and keylengths and go elliptic curve, baby!

[01:41:12] <jaybe> there are reasons iirc from recent reading that 1024 is 'better' simply because there are significant enough facilities that do not support greater than that to warrant being 'less secure' with the dkim hash that no one cares about really
