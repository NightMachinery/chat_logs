[02:48:48] <hiya> But for this one I will use backported kernel and mesa
[02:48:52] <somiaj> though as I'm sure it has been mentioned to you before, debian isn't often the best os for those with brand new hardware, as debian's goals don't necessarly support the newer kernel/xorg drivers/mesa required for brand new gpus
[02:49:15] <somiaj> you may be waiting a long time for mesa, I dno't see that backported all that often.
[02:49:30] <ExplosiveUB> is debian always the best os for new hardware? that's interesting to me
[02:50:57] <sney> "isn't"
[02:51:15] <somiaj> ExplosiveUB: your signal to noise ratio is way to low, please try to speak less nonsense.
[02:51:26] <ExplosiveUB> ok

[02:56:22] <xx> I'm offered a first upgrade of linux kernel on bullseye. Is the upgrade procedure still the same as on buster, or anything new needs to be taken care of when kernel upgrades?
[02:56:46] *** Joins: Erawan (~Erawan@user/erawan)
[02:57:15] <somiaj> just upgrade as with any security upgrade then reboot
[02:57:32] <Blondie101010> make sure to do the bullseye voodoo dance before you reboot
[02:57:49] <xx> no need to mess with grub, making sure there's enough space on some /boot partition, or anything of that sort?
[02:58:07] <Blondie101010> shouldn't unless you got something messed up
[02:58:09] <xx> (this was a clean bullseye installation, not an upgrade from buster)
[02:58:21] <ExplosiveUB> the process is pretty standard, i just went through and installed the updates over my old kernel
[02:58:35] <xx> ok thanks

[02:58:35] <ExplosiveUB> and after the upgrade reboot, I still booted up with a "failed to find" error
[02:58:40] *** Joins: phunyguy (~blaahchm@ubuntu/member/phunyguy)
[02:58:52] <xx> is that the misleading luks message?
[02:58:58] <Blondie101010> ExplosiveUB:  not all warnings deserve attention
[02:58:58] <xx> that has been there for a decade probably
[02:59:03] <ExplosiveUB> yes
[02:59:14] <somiaj> xx: if you ahve trouble with /boot filling up, you need to probably use a bigger /boot, it should be able to hold at least three kernels, though often a little extra space wont' hurt much.
[02:59:16] <ExplosiveUB> so, after the upgrade the luks was still there?
[02:59:35] <xx> somiaj: that was the issue on buster for me, that the default size was too small. I made it larger for bullseye.
[02:59:42] <ExplosiveUB> yeah i should just re-install the latest drivers after rebooting
[02:59:54] <ExplosiveUB> ok, sorry for wasting everyone's time
[03:00:02] <joepublic> re-install the latest drivers?  umwut?
[03:00:07] <somiaj> xx: yea, I guess if I had that issue to I would be worried, though I don't really use an extra /boot since I don't use lvm.
[03:01:39] <somiaj> xx: the kernel install worked just fine here fwiw, and now that you ahve a bigger /boot I wouldn't worry about it. And if it does fill up, you'll just get an error and not really break anything and have time to remove old kernels if needed
[03:01:53] <xx> every time I had to remember how to restart the upgrade of kernel after apt has failed due to lack of space, so yeah
[03:02:05] <ExplosiveUB> can I ask what this does exactly ?

[05:44:46] <tjcarter> No intonation whatsoever. I don't need my TTS to breathe (Apple's Alex and Victoria), but I would like to have some notion what part of speech I'm hearing.
[05:45:47] <tjcarter> The Voxin voices are nice for blind folks using Debian (even if they're non-free) because they're the HQ versions of Nuance's Samantha and Tom (US English, others for other languages) that you'd get on the iPhone
[05:46:08] <ExplosiveUB> I see (the voices are like a girl with the voice of an English female teacher... they didn't have those features on Windows phone), but there are still some non-free voices? (eg, on Windows Phones they sound like a girl in an Apple store)

[11:15:18] <Khepra> incal: pelican is packaged. quick googling suggests there's gallery plugins for it
[11:16:25] <incal> Khepra, no hit for pelican?
[11:17:02] <hiya> How much role does non-free microcode from Intel/AMD play in stability of OS in GNU/Linux? Can it be a factor in temp or performance related issues in latest hardware?

[11:17:48] <ExplosiveUB> hiya: I tried ubuntu wheezy-14.04, which includes systemd as default and I think it fixed my issue.
[11:18:06] <hiya> ExplosiveUB: systemd? How is it related?
[11:18:17] <ExplosiveUB> i guess it fixed it
[11:19:50] <incal> Khepra, weird, I'm on Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye), but no hit
[11:19:54] <Khepra> hiya: usually it DEstabilizies it :) microcode is a fickle thing. microcode surely does affect performance, the idea usually being for the better, but with security patches, for the worse. also, technically, you shouldn't need microcode package IF your bios/firmware is up to date by other means.
[11:20:02] <ExplosiveUB> yes
[11:20:07] <Khepra> incal: you probably have broken sources.list then

[12:00:35] <ExplosiveUB> it happens. But if the host doesn't support guest driver then we can't use guest driver
[12:00:37] <PMT> Khepra: okay, sure, so by that definition, loading the virtualbox drivers makes a VM paravirt.
[12:01:05] <Khepra> PMT: it would, guest kernel drivers for the hypervisors, that's basically paravirt by all definitions
[12:01:13] <PMT> i really wish someone would ban ExplosiveUB

[12:01:25] <ExplosiveUB> It would also crash the guest kernel

[16:37:45] <PMT> co0n: there's a bug in some versions of gpg that causes it to misbehave this way even with it installed.

[20:28:57] <Khepra> oh yeah that rings a bell... and you wanted specific enp1s0 and enp2s0
[20:29:09] <yang> yes
[20:29:50] <Khepra> use: "rename" stanza of interfaces(5)  or   systemd-networkd .link   or  a custom udev rule. I'd recommend networkd with proper .link and binding them also to their MACs so they don't wander away

[20:36:23] <Blondie101010> that's like doing half a change
[20:36:26] <Blondie101010> not a great idea
[20:36:38] <yang> or can order of interfaces switch randomly at some point, so it will mess up the config
[20:36:42] <Khepra> yang: I don't know. that's rather unusual that udev already didn't rename it on boot. that'd be a buggy situation for my OCD which would scream for a remedy.
[20:37:26] <Blondie101010> checking if it's ok implies looking for the existing rule that renames it to eth0
[20:37:40] <Khepra> yang: the point of "predictable" names is that they don't reorder, being topology-dependent rather than "who's first" eth0, "what's on second" eth1 and "I don't know" is on eth2
[20:37:58] <Khepra> so if eth0 failed to, who's to say it wouldn't one day switch to eth1

[20:39:41] <Khepra> it's predictable....... "BUT".... bugs in udev can very much make it change name if you, say, (un)plugged something on the bus
[20:40:09] <Khepra> there's a few years old bug report on systemd's github about unplugging the gpu causing NIC names to change
[20:40:12] <PMT> are they "bugs" if they close them with "suck it up"?

[20:41:37] <Khepra> that was just an example. point being the "predictable" naming is very much susceptible to those very same bugs it's supposed to mitigate.  thus... bind names to MACs. if you hw nic changes its MAC, however, then burn the whole board lol

[20:47:45] <Khepra> yang: you need to setup a .network unit for addressing, and a .link unit for MAC binding. net.ifnames=0 is a kernel cmdline parameter you can stick into /etc/default/grub cmdline vars
[20:48:17] <yang> Khepra: armhf doesn't use grub, it uses uboot
[20:48:44] <Khepra> I don't know anything about uboot, sorry. so... use whatever config method to set a kernel cmdline option
[20:49:05] <Unit193> Khepra: FWIW, rather than adding a boot option that can get lost, you can simply  ln -s /dev/null /etc/systemd/network/99-default.link  update your initramfs, then reboot.
[20:49:14] <Khepra> yang: and uh... is this _debian_ or _raspbian_ ?

[20:51:50] <Unit193> Khepra: Hah, yeah fair enough.
[20:51:58] <Khepra> and fwiw, telling udev not to rename is NOT strictly needed. you can still "match" by MAC addrs for networkd config, and set whatever name to the NIC in the .link . it's just that I prefer reducing the number of subsystems that do so, starting with kernel's ethX names and binding them
[20:53:47] <Khepra> yang: so basically, you start with an /etc/systemd/networkd/some-name.link unit, and in there you define a [Match] section with MACAddress= bind to the NIC's mac, and a [Link] section with Name=ethX where X is the one you want
[20:54:00] <yang> ok
[20:54:56] <Khepra> then you need a some-name.network unit in the same directory, with a [Match] section for Name= this time (using the name you bound in the .link), and [Network] section that then defines whether its dhcp, or static Address=, Gateway=, whatever else you might need
[20:55:25] <Khepra> the two units needn't be named the same, but I prefer naming them for the NIC name, thus  eth0.link and eth0.network,  eth1.link, eth1.network, ....
[20:55:41] <Khepra> (it's the .link and .network suffixes for units that matter)
[20:55:44] <yang> ok I have /etc/systemd/networkd.conf which looks like this https://paste.debian.net/hidden/d1a7bbdc/
[20:56:04] <yang> I need to create a /etc/systemd/netrokd/ directory I guess
[20:56:37] <Khepra> networkd.conf is something else, nothing to do with NIC units, it's for the daemon itself

[23:26:24] <PerfDave> sussudio: Could be that I shouldn't expect any better from the hardware, it just feels wrong.
[23:26:25] <randall> PerfDave: What Desktop environment are you running that you're still using xorg?
[23:26:35] <PerfDave> randall: Standard Debian 11 install with KDE
[23:26:35] <randall> sussudio: ha :)
[23:26:56] <sussudio> PerfDave: i have a laptop that performs 3D games like shit too. it was a freebie, though.
[23:26:59] <randall> PerfDave: Then you should be running wayland, AFAIK. Which is where I'd expect more FPS.
[23:27:28] <randall> PerfDave: Do you have the non-free firmware installed?
[23:27:30] <PerfDave> randall: Well, that's not how d-i set it up :)

[23:28:00] <mannequin> one sip for Yahve
[23:28:03] <mannequin> one for myself
[23:28:15] <PerfDave> randall: Which one? I've got intel-media-va-driver-non-free installed, but AFAIK that's mostly helpful for video encoding.
[23:28:38] <sussudio> a budget agp card (nvidia gf6200) on a p4-2GHz performs much better than the laptop.

[23:29:50] <randall> PerfDave: "firmware-linux"
[23:30:42] <randall> PerfDave: Ah, or rather intel-microcode, which also ships the CPU/GPU firmware for Intel.
[23:31:07] <sney> !i915 firmware
[23:31:08] <dpkg> Some Intel UHD GPUs made after 2015 require firmware from userspace for all features to be enabled. This includes Skylake, Kabylake, Broxton, Cannonlake and possibly others. Ask me about <non-free sources> and install firmware-misc-nonfree to provide.
[23:31:14] *** Quits: defiant (~defiant@user/defiant) (Quit: defiant)
[23:32:44] <PerfDave> OK I've installed firmware-linux-nonfree, will reboot and see if that helps.
[23:32:47] <randall> PerfDave: Apparently you need to install "plasma-workspace-wayland" according to https://wiki.debian.org/Wayland#KDE_Plasma_.28supported_since_5.4.2B-.29.
[23:33:01] <randall> PerfDave: That's no default, and will enable wayland for you.
[23:33:12] <PerfDave> randall: All I know about Wayland is that Firefox rarely works well with it :/
[23:33:30] *** Joins: rgr (~user@ip-109-42-114-87.web.vodafone.de)
[23:33:32] <PerfDave> But I'll try one thing at a time - first the firmware, then Wayland if that doens't help :)
[23:33:58] <randall> PerfDave: I'm running wayland on my laptop here with a fairly recent CPU/GPU, and firefox is fine :)
[23:34:11] <randall> PerfDave: yes, good idea.
[23:35:30] *** Joins: _aeris_ (~aeris@gateway/tor-sasl/aeris)
[23:36:26] <PerfDave> I'm expecting to see more Intel-specific messages in Xorg.0.log TBH, with xserver-xorg-video-intel installed

[23:36:39] *** _aeris_ is now known as aeris
[23:39:59] <somiaj> if you have xserver-xorg-video-modesetting installed, intel cards will use that driver by default, which is the one you should most likely be using
[23:40:29] <PerfDave> somiaj: I do not, I'll have a crack at it
[23:40:49] <somiaj> you can also make an xorg.conf snippiet to force the use of the intel driver, but in general most will not want to be using xserver-xorg-video-intel on modern xorg/kernel
[23:41:14] <PerfDave> Apparently xserver-xorg-video-modesetting is a virtual package provided by xserver-xorg-core :)
[23:41:47] <PerfDave> Looks like that's what xorg is using already though according to my log / that paste
[23:42:33] <PerfDave> Hmm, kwin-wayland is a PREVIEW release :/
[23:43:03] <somiaj> ahh yea, the modesetting driver is now core, forgot about that
[23:43:23] <sney> plasma wayland mostly works fine on intel hardware, I was using it for a bit, though application support still isn't all there
