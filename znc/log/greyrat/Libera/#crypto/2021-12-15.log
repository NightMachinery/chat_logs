[02:08:15] <Hash> sarnold: thanks man
[02:08:18] <Hash> wasamasa: yes sir
[02:08:25] <Hash> rk4: this is real
[02:09:02] <Hash> I've been working very hard lately, and I also used to do security stuff but then software dev for 12+ years and now back to security. Doing my 2nd bachelors.
[02:09:14] <Hash> I'm not an expert, but not a noob either.
[02:09:30] <Hash> I'm a 'specialist', heh.
[02:09:55] <Wulf> üëç
[02:10:08] <rk4> what was the 1st and is the 2nd bachelors?
[02:10:13] <rk4> tense is hard :\
[02:10:20] <Hash> First was Comp. Sci in 2004
[02:10:51] <Hash> This is Bachelors of Science in Cyber Security and Information Assurance
[02:11:16] <rk4> ah, why did you opt for a 2nd bach over a masters?
[02:11:24] <Hash> Cheap.
[02:11:31] <Hash> Masters is graduate school and you pay for it.
[02:11:36] <rk4> fair, masters are fucking expensive here :<
[02:11:42] <Hash> Bachelor is undergrand you can get gov funding
[02:11:50] <Hash> Only loans for masters
[02:11:55] <rk4> though bach is damned expensive too just not quite so obscenely
[02:12:04] <Hash> But bachelors can get federal aid, student aid, scholarships etc.
[02:12:12] <Hash> I got a scholarship too since my last grades were good
[02:12:27] <Hash> 3.6 cumulative GPA and 3.8 last semester GPA
[02:12:45] <Hash> So I got a scholarship, federal student aid, and that paid for all my school
[02:12:48] <rk4> these american numbers mean nothing to me, but i presume those are good numbers :P
[02:13:06] <Hash> Then I got a student loan of 14k/yr to live/get by
[02:13:10] <Hash> Since I'm not working
[02:13:16] <Hash> So this is my 2nd year
[02:13:30] <Hash> I already did 56 units, and I'm more than halfway done in 1 year only
[02:13:37] <Hash> so 4 year bachelor degre finished in 2 years
[02:13:43] <rk4> nice
[02:13:43] <Hash> I'm working VERY hard.

[02:14:40] <rk4> would be nice to return to uni, get myself an education, but the oppotunity cost + fees is kind of giant

[02:18:07] <Hash> You do college exam, if you pass the really hard college exam, you get free voucher for optional certification
[02:18:14] <rk4> where do you intend to go that values all these certs
[02:18:24] <rk4> or do you like the cert learning experience
[02:18:30] <Hash> They are part of the degree.
[02:18:36] <rk4> curious
[02:18:48] <Hash> You do college exam, if pass, then cert, if pass, then graduate.
[02:18:55] <Hash> You need college education + industry cert
[02:18:55] <rk4> when i was at uni we had debates as to if we were a uni or a trade school when it came to certs
[02:20:10] <rk4> i've never heard of this required certs in a bachelors before
[02:21:08] <Hash> My first cert was MCSE :)
[02:21:13] <Hash> 1997
[02:22:08] <rk4> might have a RHCE somewhere...but it only seemed to matter for jobs that i didn't care for

[02:24:36] <Hash> Well yeah
[02:24:42] <Hash> Security is actually double tough
[02:25:31] <Hash> You have to know multiple OS, their internals, commandlines for them all, their shells/interfaces/guts, networking technologies + hardwre, protocols, software dev, version control, pentesting, administrtion, management
[02:25:51] <Hash> I mean, in my humble opinion, security is the hardest of them all as it combines pretty much everything.
[02:26:06] <Hash> I mean you could pick a sector of security and focus on a niche area sure
[02:26:18] <rk4> could you say the same of the humble sys admin :P
[02:26:24] <Hash> Well, not really.
[02:26:31] <rk4> why not?
[02:26:35] <Hash> You need to know enough to script stuff for ssytem automation

[02:27:00] <Hash> Unless you are also the security architect
[02:27:10] <Hash> The delegation for a sys admin is different than security
[02:27:12] <rk4> for a mediocre sys admin, just like a mediocre security person, script some stuff, follow some pentesting checklist
[02:27:22] <Hash> For example you won't sit there doing forensics or pentesting
[02:27:28] <Hash> That's not part of sys admin work
[02:27:32] <Hash> i mean like tht
[02:27:41] <Hash> Not tht you dont need to know security or coding or networking 
[02:27:57] <Hash> Sure as an admin you need to know all that too, but just not in so much depth
[02:28:06] <Hash> If you're a network admin, then you do more network admin work than system admin
[02:28:13] <Hash> Systems admins just maintian systems, really.
[02:28:20] <Hash> Network admisn maintain networks
[02:28:20] <rk4> hmm

[02:28:50] <Hash> Yeah, sysadmin is morestly responsible for security patching, keeping up to date, AV, appliation software, troublehshooting

[17:45:06] <dostoyevsky2> Does anyone know a tokenization strategy that works for images?
[17:46:40] <MacGyver> Depends on whether you care about file equality or image equality.
[17:47:16] <MacGyver> File equality is like any blob, just hash with salt.
[17:47:37] <MacGyver> (Or generate a random number and keep a list somewhere)
[17:48:46] <MacGyver> For image equality, you'd need some kind of feature extraction algorithm, then tokenize the feature vector somehow.
[17:48:56] <MacGyver> That's what those CSAM-scanners seem to be doing nowadays.
[17:49:06] <ms7821> here are a lot of image hashing algorithms
[17:49:15] <ms7821> (perceptual ones)
[17:50:07] <ms7821> but I'm not sure exactly what's meant by tokenization. What kind of attack do you need to prevent?
[17:54:40] <dostoyevsky2> Yeah, tokenization is such an overloaded term.  I mean PII-related tokenization.  E.g. the simplest form is when you pay with credit card and on your bill you see the last digits as *****
[17:55:18] <dostoyevsky2> So if you had an image of a identity card... is there a way to tokenize a PNG?
[17:56:43] <dostoyevsky2> I mean you could always just substitute the bytes of the PNG with a tokenization scheme but that wouldn't be a valid PNG anymore... whereas tokenization schemes for CCs actually produce valid CCs
[17:57:17] <ms7821> you want to hide PII in an image but still have a valid image?
[17:57:18] <MacGyver> Applying the principle of data minimization would be along the lines of extracting the relevant data from the image and then erasing the image entirely.
[17:58:48] <MacGyver> Don't be tempted by stuff like blurring, any usable blur is easily reverted by machine-learned algorithms nowadays.
[17:59:07] <ms7821> and if you're worried about storing stuff in a DB, you could just store a URL and apply access control to the URL
[18:01:07] <TimMc> Doesn't tokenization involve substituting unique values for unique values?
[18:01:17] <TimMc> Just redacting parts of the information wouldn't achieve that.
[18:01:19] <ms7821> honestly, tokenization is a bit of a weird term and not a pattern to follow unless you have to work with legacy systems
[18:02:04] <ms7821> you could argue that stripe transaction IDs are tokenisation but I don't really think you need to describe it that way
[18:02:18] <MacGyver> TimMc: What they just described was redacting though.
[18:02:23] <TimMc> Oh yeah, usually it needs to follow a specific format.
[18:02:31] <ms7821> whereas retrofitting a system to obscure card IDs might undergo tokenization as a hardening step
[18:02:42] <ms7821> it just doesn't make sense for images
[18:02:43] <dostoyevsky2> Well in PCI contexts tokenization is a requirement.  I just was wondering what other schemes there are, maybe even ones that work for images
[18:03:00] <TimMc> Is it a requirement, or an option?
[18:03:01] <ms7821> I don't think it is
[18:03:18] <dostoyevsky2> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_(data_security) <- doesn't mention images
[18:04:17] <TimMc> Replace the data of the image of the card with a PNG that just reads "why are we storing pictures of cards anyhow?"
[18:04:21] *** Joins: bsdbandit01 (~bsdbandit@172.58.191.152)
[18:04:28] <MacGyver> dostoyevsky2: The scheme you mentioned as an example is very much *not* tokenization.
[18:04:34] <dostoyevsky2> I guess the simplest version would to load a PNG do the tokenization on the pixels and then create a new PNG from these pixels
[18:04:49] <dostoyevsky2> And the resulting image would look like static
[18:04:59] <MacGyver> dostoyevsky2: The whole point of that redaction is not being able to map back to a specific creditcard, whereas with tokenization, the point is to be able to do exactly that.
[18:05:03] <MacGyver> dostoyevsky2: So which is it?
[18:05:38] <TimMc> dostoyevsky2: It would be better if you could describe the actual information security needs, leaving PCI aside.
[18:07:13] <dostoyevsky2> TimMc: I wrote a PCI-compliant vault for a Bank once and was always wondering how it would work with images...  I was expecting Tokenization to be a much broader topic
[18:07:47] <ms7821> so you know how tokenization can be implemented?
[18:08:01] *** Quits: bsdbandit01 (~bsdbandit@172.58.191.152) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[18:08:09] <ms7821> i.e. you need co-operation with the system that actually holds the sensitive information
[18:08:13] <ms7821> how on earth would that work with images?
[18:11:11] <TimMc> Without knowing more, and assuming the images need to look like images, what I would do is just encrypt the image and then append it to a placeholder PNG.
[18:13:22] <dostoyevsky2> ms7821: The idea is that it works without cooperation.
[18:13:31] <ms7821> that's just not true
[18:13:55] <dostoyevsky2> ms7821: You generate a valid CC, that is tokenized... ofc processors know its a token... but all the validation checks still work
[18:14:41] <ms7821> that's only for the very narrow case of card IDs, because of legacy requirements
[18:14:49] <dostoyevsky2> What happens then is that the auditor activates a HSM for reports... and audits the detokenization, e.g. generates a report with the true CCs, then removes the HSM again
[18:15:02] <ms7821> as I said, stripe charge IDs could also be called tokenization, and they don't look like card IDs
[18:15:18] <dostoyevsky2> So the vault had two components: custom filesystems and the vault itself

[18:23:06] <ms7821> what should they look like as normal PNGs? random noise? who will be looking at them and deciding they're "normal PNGs"?
[18:25:33] <dostoyevsky2> ms7821: At least they should be convertible into another lossless image format without errors... and scripts should be able to figure out the dimension etc..

[18:28:54] <ms7821> OK, so you're not going to restrict the validation, so you've got the equivalent of a card number tokenization system where the output doesn't need to look like a card number

[18:34:38] <ms7821> you understand that tokenisation is not encryption, rigth?

[18:35:46] <MacGyver> Tokenization *does not* have to be format-preserving.
[18:36:03] <ms7821> no, but you don't seem to appreciate that the output of tokenization is just an opaque... token
[18:36:04] <MacGyver> The PCI standard supplement itself is pretty clear on the definition. https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Tokenization_Guidelines_Info_Supplement.pdf
[18:36:38] <MacGyver> And encryption is definitely *a* form of tokenization.

[18:37:03] <ms7821> yeah, you could (if you liked taking risks) use format-preserving encryption as tokenization
[18:37:55] <ms7821> but the important bit of it is that the person holding the token can't use it without co-operation of the party who holds the actual data
[18:38:41] <ms7821> so you'd also need to include some way of preventing reuse of the token if you did that

[18:40:20] <dostoyevsky2> ms7821: When you pay with your CC, the restaurant only really needs to know the issuer of the CC... that's why the first four digits are preserved on your bill... a very common tokenization scheme that is also preserves some information
[18:40:31] <ms7821> absolutely not true
[18:40:42] <maroon> they put the FINAL 4
[18:41:05] <maroon> the 1st 4 isnt sufficient to identify the issuer, sometimes the issuer is identified by up to 6 digits
[18:41:19] <ms7821> heh, I had a shop put the first 12 the other day
[18:41:25] <maroon> ie, there are more than 9999 possible issuers
[18:41:54] <ms7821> if the last 4 digits of my card number were a token, I'd be able to use it to make charges
[18:41:55] <maroon> of the final 4, that last digit is a checksum

[18:43:48] <MacGyver> And either way, that is *not* tokenization, that is redaction.

[18:45:19] <MacGyver> Your CC-number with 3/4ths of the digits redacted is not a token mapping back to the actual CC number.
[18:45:44] <maroon> there's been known cases of documents using a proportional font being blacked out, and people were able to identify the hidden string by the pixel length matching only 1 of the likely candidates
[18:46:04] <ms7821> yeah, image processing is often very leaky

[18:49:33] <maroon> the CC usually uses the Luhn algorithm, whose purpose is not being a hidden token, but trying to detect most input errors due to skipping/transposing digits
[18:49:49] <dostoyevsky2> > The PCI DSS standard dictates that only the first six and last four digits of the PAN may be printed on a receipt or displayed in cases other than where a business need requires the full PAN. US federal law (FACTA) allows only the display of the last 5 digits.
[18:50:15] <dostoyevsky2> In the EU the first digits of the CC are common

[18:50:36] <maroon> well if there's a few common issuers, yeah
[18:51:19] <maroon> and the 1st digit is often a good indicator whether it's mastercard/vista/discover/etc
[18:51:47] <dostoyevsky2> Yeah, not sure if the issuer is that important.. the processor is
[18:52:07] <dostoyevsky2> and there aren't many
[18:52:27] <maroon> i dont see how that could be part of the CC number, as it would require reissuing all cards if someone changed that

[18:59:28] <ms7821> if you really want to tokenise images, store them in a DB alongside a random 16-character string, and use that string as the token
[19:00:39] <MacGyver> As I suggested at the start.
[19:00:54] <ms7821> you can then do what you want with the 16-character string, maybe use it as a seed for a GAN
[19:01:12] <dostoyevsky2> ms7821: Please note that PCI DSS specifies: No encrypted data on disks
[19:01:22] <ms7821> OK?
[19:01:37] <ms7821> I don't think it does, but w/e you're not reading what anyone says

[19:12:11] <dostoyevsky2> So this the beauty of tokenization.  You end up with a key that contains your vault to translate all the tokenized data you can just store on disk.  If those disks get lots, sold on ebay and someone has a quatum computer breaking all kind of current encryption... it doesn't matter as long as you protect that key, which is small enough to be easily backuped in various ways
[19:12:42] <yawkat> Except for all the metadata 
[19:13:36] <ms7821> you're conflating tokenisation with encryption again
[19:14:00] <MacGyver> And encryption keys with encrypted data.
[19:15:52] <maroon> so if you don't save encrypted data to disk, are you supposed to have some navajo to memorize it like on xfiles?
[19:17:58] <TimMc> Clearly you're supposed to save it to tape.
