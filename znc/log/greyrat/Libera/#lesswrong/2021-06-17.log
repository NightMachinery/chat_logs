[00:00:30] <pompolic> i just had an idea
[00:01:29] <pompolic> "pomodoro but less contrived" -- i want something that watches what window is focused and can start/stop a timer
[00:01:48] <gwern> Betawolf: that they ate him? that hardly even sounds worth mentioning if you are proceeding to cannibalism
[00:01:57] <pompolic> or rather, can run a script to update some state based on focus changes
[00:02:14] <gwern> Betawolf: I think it would be rather more horrible if Tiger was still around at the cannibalism...

[00:02:31] <pompolic> is there anything like this for X11/xfce?
[00:02:35] <Betawolf> I mean, Tiger was built up as a beloved pet who had lots of adventures with Pym and appeared to save him multiple times.
[00:03:07] <Betawolf> The guy they eat is just some mutineer.
[00:03:10] <gwern> but still just a dog
[00:04:16] <galambo> pompolic, nice idea. I didnt have a great experience with pomodoro. I think the best approach for me was to be in a room with other people also having a pomodoro. its like being in a library. everyone around you is reading/studying so you feel encouraged to do the same.

[00:05:09] <pompolic> i think pomodoro is kind of stupid
[00:05:34] <pompolic> the specific problem i want to solve is that i want a reminder that my attention has drifted
[00:05:54] <pompolic> and the explicit action to start a timer is just contrived
[00:07:10] <ggreer> apparently gnome-calculator has a fucking http client built in because it needs to fetch exchange rates for financial calculations
[00:07:24] <pompolic> starting a timer on focus switch would not require an explicit action

[00:22:28] <ggreer> out of 100 million americans who have been vaccinated, the CDC has found 132 who died of covid. median age of them is 82

[00:28:12] <gwern> kuudes: of those 10, I had 2, being generous. really, it was almost certainly just an ordinary run of the mill stomach bug of the sort travelers get in the tens of millions every year
[00:28:27] <kuudes> here the recommendation is to get tested if you have any of those symptoms
[00:28:34] <kuudes> but usa is different of course
[00:28:51] <kuudes> people from some other countries complain that finland tests too little
[00:28:58] <gwern> you travel somewhere like india, you just allot a day or two for being sick evenb if you 'don't drink the water'
[00:28:59] <Khoth> if it was like the day after meeting all the people then it's too soon to be covid cuaght there anyway
[00:29:31] <kuudes> I presume getting tested is nontrivial in your location, because you are not doing it immediately?
[00:29:34] <gwern> Khoth: yes, that's a good point, but I could've hypothetically caught covid at the gym or shopping that week
[00:29:53] <gwern> kuudes: what would be the point of being tested?
[00:30:19] <kuudes> none if you don't care about spreading the disease, I guess
[00:30:23] <saturn2> ABC Always Be Covid-positive
[00:30:48] <kuudes> personally I have been tested some 20 times so far, but I am likely an outlier
[00:31:16] <kuudes> if it cost to me or was more hard than book on same day drive in, I presume it would be fewer
[00:31:36] <Khoth> nobody's been tested except for "covid" kuudes who has been tested 5 million times and is an outlier
[00:31:41] <gwern> well, if I get tested and it was positive I guess I would just have to cancel all my plans to [checks notes] sit at home alone with my cat catching up on papers and writing for a week
[00:31:42] <Ralith> you judged yourself to have covid-like symptoms on 20 different occasions?
[00:32:03] <kuudes> I have flu like symptoms often because of things
[00:32:45] <kuudes> I have explained this multiple times to doctors, and asked them to consider again
[00:32:58] <kuudes> but it has been "just have a covid test, it does not take that long"
[00:33:29] <kuudes> ie it is not that much of by choice - I have been in contact with a doctor over the app and they have ordered me to get tested
[00:33:39] <kuudes> I like that now they have made the spit sampling available

[00:34:26] <kuudes> I presume this has been prosocial from me because a chief doctor publicly praised people who have had more than 10 tests so far. otherwise I would be more sceptical
[00:34:28] <Khoth> anyway a rare covid symptom without any of the common ones, while vaccinated, after eating strange food, hardly seems like a covid smoking gun
[00:34:41] <kuudes> yeah, could be
[00:34:52] <kuudes> and in usa, I don't know what you guys should do. it is a different world there
[00:35:42] <kuudes> asking from a doctor seems likely not an option etc, and I presume covid tests may cost much or something
[00:36:15] <kuudes> over here the public tests are free but I have done tests on private clinic because my employer pays for faster testing there
[00:36:23] <kuudes> they got shipped to korea for a while or something
[00:37:04] <kuudes> but I have to say, I like the app of my workplace healthcare provider
[00:37:36] <kuudes> quick yes/no questions and then you get put into a queue for a chat with a doctor, who diagnoses quick cases quickly and off you go
[00:38:28] <kuudes> and it allows you to automatically send the paperwork securely to your employer if you fill in the email of the target person etc
[00:38:30] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : The benefits of the internet continues to surprise me regularly. Case in point, you can email the creator of a psychological test battery, and he will, apparently, reply back to you.

[00:40:38] <kuudes> I guess in usa, when you have had two doses, there is not much to do anymore O_o
[00:40:55] <kuudes> I mean, it seems unlikely there would now appear coordination to suppress further spread, or?

[07:15:18] <catern> the sponsorship at the end of that geese video was a very smooth transition
[07:21:23] <PlanckWalk> Here we use ranked choice voting.  My highest-ranked candidate actually elected was rank 12-ish.
[07:22:42] <PlanckWalk> (We also elect more than one per ballot)
[07:23:13] <PlanckWalk> So yes, a maximum fo 5 ranks is just dumb.
[07:24:53] <feep> I don't think that follows
[07:26:08] <PlanckWalk> "Dumb" here means "does not allow a voter to adequately express their preferences between electable candidates"
[07:26:26] <feep> I still don't think that follows
[07:26:48] <feep> because you're looking at a choice of candidates defined by the availability of a rcv
[07:27:01] * gwern is unconvinced voters even have that many meaningful preferences
[07:27:12] <feep> so it's circular, in a non-rcv system you wouldn't have that many choices to begin with
[07:27:42] <saturn2> what is voting? we just don't know
[07:27:50] <gwern> I mean, we're talking about voters who are for or against invading Madeupistan when asked, think winter is when the earth is further from the sun in its orbit, and vote for the names they recognize rather than policies
[07:27:51] <feep> like how, in the german system, you wouldn't run a party if you'd expect to never hit 5%
[07:28:21] <PlanckWalk> There are ways it could be "collapsed", e.g. I could collapse 10 of the ranks into 2 just by choosing a party, but there are particular individuals that I do not under any circumstances want to elect.
[07:28:32] <PlanckWalk> (Regardless of party)
[07:29:15] <PlanckWalk> Though yes, at position 21 and 22 for example if everybody else has been eliminated, I still have to indicate which I hate least.
[07:29:16] <feep> I mean, not electing people is generally easy :P
[07:29:43] <catern> gwern: are you just talking about candidate preferences? because many voters do have preferences about concrete issues, e.g. punish crime X more or less than Y amount (even if they do have other preferences that are nonsensical in addition to those)
[07:29:50] <shawwwn> Indeed. I for one haven’t been elected even once
[07:30:13] <gwern> catern: but you can manipulate those very easily by framing, and they typically have no idea about the candidates' actual positions anyway
[07:30:55] <PlanckWalk> So for example I woudl feel happy about being able to rank "all of Blue party" ahead of any of the others, and then "any of Mauve party *except* Shady McDodgerson"
[07:31:31] <feep> scriptable choice voting
[07:31:38] <feep> ranked choice vm
[07:31:53] <PlanckWalk> But in practice that's representable by individual ranks
[07:31:59] <catern> gwern: yes, that's fair, but you could imagine, e.g., a single-issue abortion voter just voting the slate given to them by a pro/anti-abortion organization, which ranks the 10 pro/anti-abortion candidates against the other 10 anti/pro-abortion candidates - except that that can't be expressed if you're limited in ranking...

[08:25:07] <feep> google can make it hard to tell between "we're translating this from chinese" and "we're translating this to chinese"
[08:25:26] <feep> also apparently "cry up" is a valid phrasing? so it's not misquoted either
[08:25:27] <gwern> I was thinking that, but it's odd for them to apply it to themselves, I guess
[08:25:33] <feep> so I basically said one thing correctly there lol
[08:25:37] <gwern> 'cry up' is extremely archaic
[08:25:56] <feep> do not cry up that which you cannot sell down
[08:26:10] <gwern> 'sure, it's easy to cry up a commodity but where do you bury the body'
[08:26:34] <feep> I don't follow that one
[08:27:07] <gwern> it makes sense, it's just bizarre to mash together trading jargon from like no older than the 1950s with a more 1700s-esque expression

[08:31:26] <feep> dbohdan: anyway, the min/max code is now a good example of how nice sumtypes are https://github.com/FeepingCreature/Cx/blob/master/src/cx/macros/listcomprehension.cx#L172

[08:31:30] <feep> every language should have sumtypes
[08:33:50] <adiabatic> that's the kind of thing you'd want if you want to have a Maybe<T> that is either T or None, right?
[08:34:04] <shawwwn> Ooo
[08:34:22] <adiabatic> (I probably know what sum types are from TypeScript but it's not coming to me)
[08:34:26] <shawwwn> ProphetNet is clearly one of the coolest model names
[08:35:44] <feep> adiabatic: yeah
[08:35:47] <feep> basically
[08:39:46] <feep> adiabatic: so in cx terms. I mean, I'll have a proper Maybe later that can be if-decomposed automatically, but for now, you'd do something like
[08:39:49] <feep> (T | :none)
[08:40:26] <feep> though my find() still returns -1 :P (because of the aforementioned lack of if-decomposition)
[08:41:44] <feep> ie. the idea is that you should be able to do if (auto value <- "Hello World".find("bla")) and since find returns (bool, T) or something, the bool is used for the if, and the T is used for the assignment
[08:42:16] <feep> obviously with more type candy so you know what's happening

[08:43:59] <adiabatic> oh, yeah, that. I'm used to types like `string | number | null | undefined` from TS.

[09:39:24] <shawwwn> one surprising thing I learned from last night's experiments with RiversHaveWings' code is that it's hard to make a network that works at all. you'd think it'd be kind of easy to make a classifier, but no
[09:39:31] <shawwwn> for example
[09:40:03] <kuudes> good morning
[09:41:18] <shawwwn> on mnist classification, the best performance seemed to come from a very simple network: conv2d from 1 channel (greyscale) to 16 channels (kernel size 3), downsample with max pool, conv2d 16channels to 16channels (kernel size 3), downsample again, then finish off with a linear layer mapping from 16 * w//4 * h//4 to 10 (the number of digits you want)
[09:41:28] <shawwwn> super simple. conv, down, conv, down, linear, done
[09:41:51] <shawwwn> runs very fast, classification accuracy starts off at 97% within the first epoch and grows up to 98.5%
[09:42:07] <shawwwn> and this turns out to be nearly impossible to beat, at least in my fuckery attempts
[09:42:53] <shawwwn> seemingly any attempt to make the network deeper or more complicated made the accuracy either drop like a stone (usually around to 91% on first epoch) or just not increase beyond 95%
[09:43:17] <shawwwn> I even tried dropping in a biggan-style discriminator and using that as a classifier
[09:43:48] <shawwwn> but skip connections, 1x1 -> 3x3 -> 3x3 -> 1x1 blocks, etc, all were slower or worse
[09:44:01] <shawwwn> caveat: this was all on mnist. so none of this probably generalizes at all
[09:44:21] <shawwwn> still, in the context of "everything works on mnist", it was surprising how few of my designs actually worked on mnist
[09:44:53] <shawwwn> that said, I did test out a few FFT ideas, and it was neat seeing that the network is apparently capable of correctly classifying an FFT'd image with about the same accuracy as a normal image
[09:45:33] <shawwwn> so "just put it in frequency space lol" at least works (though it's not obviously a better idea without something fancy, e.g. doing self-attention on a smaller number of coefficients than the full image)
[09:52:15] <nshepperd2> mnist is weird

[10:27:04] <feep[work]> kuudes: imo the huge missed opportunity here, and something I really wanna find out
[10:27:35] <feep[work]> is how many of the bad things associated with homelessness, ie. disturbances, drug abuse, theft whatever, are how big a subset of the homeless
[10:28:02] <feep[work]> like the article is like "we moved them in a hotel and there were disturbances" but I wanna know how many you would have to *take out* of the hotel to drop the disturbances by 50%, 90%, 99%...
[10:29:15] <adiabatic> the old British meme is CATO: 40% crazy, 30% addicts, 20% tramps (people who just like the lifestyle), and 10% Out of Luck.
[10:29:33] <feep[work]> is that ... based on anything?
[10:30:07] <adiabatic> secondhand hearsay based on someone who was handling this sort of thing in England, probably several decades ago
[10:39:32] <adiabatic> It's not a _great_ prior, and it's even less relevant possibly with the post-covid to-california exodus, but it's _something_

[10:45:46] <adiabatic> it's old and foreign (read: doubly foreign), but the guy didn't really have any reason to misrepresent the truth, er, flat-out lie because he's already in favor of one policy or another
[10:45:49] <kuudes> well, yes, often homeless people have problems and there are benefits from supported housing, ie having some sort of social care included
[10:46:16] <nshepperd2> sounds like an ironic slogan. "Cato Institute - 40% crazy, 30% addicts, 20% tramps, 10% out of luck - 100% libertarian"

[11:04:02] <Logos01> mst: I know right?
[11:04:04] <feep[work]> also lol, yeah from what I remember of america this is basically "so the clinic is on the same block, eh"
[11:05:24] <Logos01> feep[work]: It's ... 0.5 kilometers away.
[11:05:43] <feep[work]> well, for america isn't it more a question of number of highway crossings?
[11:06:05] <feep[work]> ie. walking distance being more a matter of where you can walk as compared to how far you can walk
[11:06:47] <mst> New York: Green light at instersection means you may get run over by everybody crossing
[11:06:59] <feep[work]> okay that's a bit worrying
[11:07:02] <mst> also New York: Red light means you'll *probably* only get run over by a taxi
[11:07:13] <feep[work]> I admit I had only seen pictures of new york and so I assumed that
[11:07:14] <feep[work]> like
[11:07:18] <feep[work]> at crossings, you could cross
[11:07:39] <mst> I mean, it's not that big a problem since nothing's going faster than 10mph anyway because of the traffic
[11:08:29] <feep[work]> yeah ftr for a german city, I think the practically walkable distance is something like 2km, beyond that point it gets a bit annoying
[11:08:45] <feep[work]> but that's more the limiting factor of "walking is slow, who knew"
[11:09:16] <Logos01> feep[work]: I don't even need to cross a 'main' street.
[11:09:27] <Logos01> Not a single traffic light.
[11:09:32] <feep[work]> nice
[11:09:50] <Logos01> "Tell me you're american without saying you're american":  I'm still gonna drive there.
[11:09:55] <feep[work]> I mean, at least that's a reasonable reason to wait

[11:10:28] <Logos01> In my defense on driving 0.5km of side streets rather than walking...
[11:10:47] <Logos01> A) it's hot as shit outside right now.  B) I have other driving I need to do tomorrow anyhow and I can double up on it.
[11:11:21] <feep[work]> yeah, I absolutely love my escooter, I basically bought it just so I don't have to drive a bike in the summer

[11:13:36] <feep[work]> I mean so then I'm not sure why you're all putting it out here :p
[11:13:39] <Logos01> The thing I'm getting at is that I didn't even check for if there was a clinic in walking distance so I could do it anyhow.

[11:14:06] <feep[work]> I feel this is a "slap your head, update your strats, and move on" thing
[11:14:11] <Logos01> Well it's not actually a clinic, it's a grocery store but I already knew it was one with a pharmacy and that they do seasonal flu vaccines there.
[11:14:19] <Logos01> So it *should* have been apparent that I could at least check the place.
[11:14:38] <feep[work]> yeah but people don't tend to interrogate their established routines.

[12:12:41] <feep[work]> cause on the stock german layout {} and [] are really fucking awkward to input, and it's probably doing bad things to my hand lol
[12:13:15] <synthmeat> i guess i'm lucky with my language i can just normalize to us alphabet and it's still all clear
[12:13:21] <feep[work]> I mean
[12:13:22] <feep[work]> I can do that
[12:13:25] <feep[work]> it just looks like shit
[12:15:22] <PapuaHardyNet> feep, are you german?
[12:15:28] <feep[work]> yes
[12:15:38] <PapuaHardyNet> good to hear
[12:15:50] <feep[work]> .. crap, the german kinesis advantage just copies that horrible unergonomic decision
[12:16:02] <feep[work]> I guess it makes sense if it's "your existing layout, but ergonomic"
[12:16:38] * feep[work] stares at the layout
[12:16:48] <feep[work]> okay actually nvm, I cannot decide if that is better ortworse
[12:16:50] <feep[work]> or worse*
[12:17:08] <feep[work]> like, the alt-gr key is in what looks at first glance p much the worst to hit key on the thumb pad
[12:17:13] <synthmeat> *orthworse
[12:17:29] <feep[work]> but it doesn't have the sort of backwards bend that normal [] has
[12:18:07] <adiabatic> I have a fairly customized ergodox EZ and the only fuckup I tend to make is, on a laptop, pressing capslock when I mean to type backspace
[12:18:08] <feep[work]> also good god I just saw the price tag on that thing
[12:18:31] <adiabatic> in general, you probably won't get too confused between normal keyboards and super duper weird keyboards if the weird keyboards are weird enough
[12:19:06] <feep[work]> adiabatic: how many keys do you feel it has "free"?
[12:19:14] <feep[work]> like, how many keys do you feel it could drop and still be well usable
[12:19:26] <synthmeat> feep[work]: uhkv2 with modules and wristpads is $650 with vat and a discount
[12:19:41] <adiabatic> feep[work]: do you need alt, ctrl, and windows-equivalent keys?
[12:19:54] <feep[work]> synthmeat: like, how do I put this. $100 is "a lot" for a keyboard by my standards.
[12:19:54] <adiabatic> or just alt and ctrl
[12:20:10] <feep[work]> adiabatic: I need-need ctrl, not sure about alt
[12:20:23] <feep[work]> I can't remember offhand what I need alt for at all, I think I use win more than alt
[12:20:40] <feep[work]> oh, alt tab I guess XD
[12:20:40] <adiabatic> because I have, like, four different command keys sprinkled all throughout
[12:20:46] <synthmeat> feep[work]: not when it's gonna be heirloom keyboard!
[12:21:10] <feep[work]> synthmeat: I'm sorta in the "$10 crap keyboard" camp so far
[12:21:24] <adiabatic> I also have a duplicate enter key (normal is left thumb, extra is far-right bottom)
[12:21:24] <feep[work]> but I could honestly go for some more ergonomics; I don't have rsi but my hands are sort of like
[12:21:29] <feep[work]> eyeing rsi brochures speculatively
[12:21:44] <feep[work]> weighing up pros and cons
[12:21:57] <PapuaHardyNet> well, you could try building an ergonomic keyboard for yourself
[12:22:07] <PapuaHardyNet> that would be a lot cheaper
[12:22:09] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: I have zero mechanical skill.
[12:22:13] <feep[work]> I do have a 3d printer.
[12:22:18] <feep[work]> I can, technically, solder a wire.
[12:22:30] <adiabatic> I could also free up a few teeny thumb buttons like the duplicate '/" and most pgup/pgdn I do on the media layer, not on the dedicated keys
[12:22:56] <PapuaHardyNet> you don't have to be experienced with it, you can ask the help of someone else who is experienced
[12:23:01] <adiabatic> and if I wanted to cut down on the layer-switch and layer-lock buttons I could turn four of those into two
[12:23:17] <PapuaHardyNet> all you need is the PCB, the keys, the keycaps, and the frame
[12:23:36] <feep[work]> adiabatic: I think given those things I could assemble a keyboard yeah
[12:23:39] <feep[work]> er
[12:23:40] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: *
[12:23:53] <PapuaHardyNet> you can buy them right now
[12:24:15] <feep[work]> link?
[12:24:18] <PapuaHardyNet> although I don't have the right links on hand. you should check /r/mechanicalkeyboard[s]
[12:24:20] <adiabatic> feep[work]: I don't know where you'd put letters like ä, ü, and ö, though; compared to a normal keyboard, there's not much extra space over on the right hand side
[12:24:39] <feep[work]> adiabatic: right, exactly
[12:24:49] <feep[work]> adiabatic: the german keyboard layout solves that by just straight up ditching []
[12:24:52] <feep[work]> buzt like
[12:24:53] <feep[work]> but like
[12:25:00] <feep[work]> for a programmer, that's a crap deal.
[12:25:01] <PapuaHardyNet> surely there's an easy way to add an umlaut to an existing vowel for german keyboards?
[12:25:13] <PapuaHardyNet> like a cmd+a gives you a umlaut
[12:25:13] <feep[work]> yes, the "that vowel with an umlaut" key
[12:25:32] <PapuaHardyNet> I meant a keychording key
[12:25:35] <feep[work]> nope
[12:25:41] <feep[work]> why? we already have a normal umlaut key
[12:25:44] <feep[work]> nobody uses [] anyway
[12:25:47] <feep[work]> no I'm not bitter
[12:25:54] <adiabatic> feep[work]: [] gets ä and ü; what gets ö?
[12:26:07] * feep[work] checks a us keymap
[12:26:20] <feep[work]> adiabatic: no it's completely different on the right
[12:26:44] <feep[work]> adiabatic: that entire cluster is shuffled around with the expectation of having a second modifier available (alt-gr)
[12:26:47] <adiabatic> oh, you have one of those recessed enter keys
[12:26:54] <feep[work]> yeah the "nice big enter key"
[12:27:19] <synthmeat> iso?
[12:27:36] <feep[work]> yep
[12:28:14] <synthmeat> yeah, i wanna move my backspace/delete away from my big fat enter :D
[12:28:23] <synthmeat> looking forward to ansi
[12:29:12] <synthmeat> that has to be stupidest design decision in keyboards ever
[12:29:31] <adiabatic> yeah, even if you move []
[12:30:03] <adiabatic> to the great big bumper keys in the middle you're still probably going to have to use the below-the-./ keys for two of üäö
[12:30:17] <adiabatic> or else - and \ go there

[13:57:12] <shawwwn> at this point I wonder how caleb maintains sanity due to all the RNG
[13:57:29] <shawwwn> I like the ff7 run because it requires massive talent just to do it perfectly
[13:57:39] <shawwwn> but then even at that level, there's so much RNG that it's like
[13:57:54] <shawwwn> "let's see if he flips tails 10 times in a row tonight"
[13:58:43] <shawwwn> e.g. diamod weapon is up next in 20 min. and I've seen him die to diamond weapon a few times
[13:58:49] <shawwwn> it's rare, but not so rare
[13:59:44] <shawwwn> game's like "mighty nice run you got there... sure would be a shame if someone decided to kill tifa"
[13:59:55] <dbohdan2> How much did he practice to get this good?
[14:05:27] <shawwwn> well, as far as I can tell, his entire income stream is due to twitch revenue
[14:05:43] <shawwwn> and the #1 thing his fanbase cares about are his ff7 runs
[14:05:57] <shawwwn> he streams other stuff occasionally, but he usually gets around ~1.2k viewers (vs 5.5k right now, for example)
[14:06:13] <shawwwn> so he's been doing almost daily ff7 runs for like

[19:16:45] <RiversHaveWings> Wowww I have never seen this, a G loss and a D loss exactly balanced
[19:16:59] <RiversHaveWings> And stable
[19:17:28] <RiversHaveWings> (It's not a standard GAN, it doesn't apply to normal GAN training)
[19:18:30] <RiversHaveWings> (It's a VAE with a patchwise discriminator)
[19:18:51] <RiversHaveWings> I bet it is actually reconstructing perfectly rn
[19:19:13] <RiversHaveWings> Or so close to it D can't pick up on the difference.
[19:20:14] <RiversHaveWings> I applied VQGAN's trick for dynamically balancing a reconstruction loss and an adversarial loss
[19:20:34] <RiversHaveWings> And the result was that D actually *drove the reconstruction loss lower* lol
[19:21:49] <RiversHaveWings> Now once the KL divergence loss warms up more the reconstructions should start suffering and D should be able to pick up the difference again
[19:22:01] <RiversHaveWings> (Assuming it didn't just collapse)
[19:28:52] <RiversHaveWings> ...Did D collapse actually
[19:29:02] <RiversHaveWings> Like did I actually see the rare case of G winning
[19:32:24] <RiversHaveWings> OK, I won't start training D until later

[19:34:33] <nshepperd> G winning might be fine, since that's what the nash equilibrium looks like i thought

[19:35:35] <RiversHaveWings> It had seen near-perfect reconstructions for so long it couldn't then start picking up when the reconstructions stopped being perfect
[19:35:42] <RiversHaveWings> It was just ignoring the input.
[19:35:49] <nshepperd> ah
[19:36:16] <RiversHaveWings> So I'm going to wait till later in training when the reconstructions are not expected to be as good
[19:36:18] <RiversHaveWings> And kick D in then
[19:36:30] <nshepperd> maybe D should get warm restarts or something
[19:36:52] <RiversHaveWings> well, once there's no longer just a reconstruction loss + G loss on G
[19:37:00] <RiversHaveWings> It can't possibly reconstruct perfectly
[19:37:05] <RiversHaveWings> And it should work from then on

[19:39:26] <nshepperd> i was thinking about VAEs earlier
[19:39:32] <RiversHaveWings> oh?
[19:40:53] <nshepperd> i think instead of having the encoder be non deterministic and a kl divergence loss to regularise the latent space, couldn't you have a deterministic encoder and use an adversarial loss to match the distribution to what it should be
[19:42:07] <nshepperd> the kl divergence seems like it throws away information by requiring added noise, whereas this would in principle allow perfect reconstruction
[19:43:39] <nshepperd> like say you're encoding to standard normal latents, you have a discriminator which tries to guess whether latents are from a standard normal or from an encoded image
[19:44:15] <RiversHaveWings> oh, hm
[19:44:17] <RiversHaveWings> maybe
[19:44:35] <nshepperd> then the encoder loss is just the sum of the reconstruction lots and adversarial loss
[19:44:36] <RiversHaveWings> (But then you get adversarial dynamics again, and a VAE doesn't have them)
[19:44:44] <RiversHaveWings> (A pure VAE I mean)
[19:45:00] <RiversHaveWings> ...It might be better than LDMGAN
[19:45:33] <RiversHaveWings> Which has the problem that the LDM loss can't detect correlations between elements of the latent
[19:46:13] <RiversHaveWings> Sigh, G won again
[19:46:20] <nshepperd> it might be more stable than a usual gan since the target space is very regular

[20:05:34] <ggreer> > The run from 0 to 60 mph happens just 1.98 seconds after the brutally hard launch. The Plaid covers distance so quickly, it's difficult to even register what's happening. The yoke gets light in your hands, your neck muscles strain as your helmeted head digs into the headrest, and your surroundings blur into mere shapes and colors as a quarter mile of pavement vanishes underneath you.
[20:09:33] <ggreer> > Amusingly, the Plaid launches so ferociously hard, it generates more than 1.00 g from 0.2 second to 2.6 seconds after launch, peaking at 1.227 g at 32 mph. That's more g than the car generated in its best 60-0-mph stop, which required 104 feet and peaked at 1.221 g.

[21:19:43] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-018-0078-7 think of it as a tree. at the terminal nodes, there are very small groups with very high internal randomness/drift; as they diffuse out their inventions to progressively larger nodes, those nodes filter more and more accurately, although they themselves are less and less creative due to said accuracy

[21:20:33] <gwern> if you had all tiny nodes, it's not very efficient: too much random drift, not enough filtering & broadcasting. if everything is collapsed into a single giant global node, then it's super-ruthless at filtering effectively, but has little to filter
[21:21:22] <gwern> so optimal turns out to be to have lots of small groups exploring randomly, but connected in a hierarchical fashion to filter out and broadcast globally their occasional fit bits

[21:57:49] <dbohdan> gwern: Is it an accident of history that explicitly graph-based social media haven't taken off or a sign of some fundamental problem with them?  The idea just seems to occur to programmers.  I've had design notes for a graph-based chatroom/forum with splitting and merging threads since the late 2000s.  I've read several discussions about similar things since.
[21:57:54] <mst> ggreer: looks like it's trying way too hard for my taste
[21:58:25] <gwern> dbohdan: we're still bumbling around, and programmers prefer heavyweight UIs explicitly exposing the abstraction. when programmers do graph stuff, they make... git.
[21:58:30] <ggreer> the clientele and the noise made me think "nope. never"

[21:59:37] <ggreer> you could also have graphs for browser history. I want to know what I visited from what, not just what I visited
[22:01:17] <PapuaHardyNet> graphs for browser history sounds great
[22:01:24] <gwern> dbohdan: way I see it, explicitly designing it is not enough of a competitive advantage over ad hoc evolved communities that are powered by chance confluences. you can design a much better 4chan, but the odds are very low that it'll overcome the actual 4chan
[22:01:31] <gwern> 'worse is better', essentially
[22:01:51] <feep> I don't think worse is better like that
[22:02:08] <ggreer> there's a ton of low hanging fruit for browsers. for example: I want to see the http status code *before* the fucking page loads. I don't want to wait 5 seconds just to see a very ornate 404 page
[22:02:14] <feep> well, sort of.
[22:02:30] <ggreer> while we're at it, make phones orient based on the face in front of them, not gravity
[22:02:35] <dbohdan> gwern: The lack of competitive advantage is a probable reason
[22:02:40] <ggreer> then you could read in bed without using rotation lock
[22:02:52] <mst> ggreer: ok, that would be cool, yes
[22:02:52] <feep> okay, the oft-missed core of worse is better is that you need to have a core competency, some way of providing value to your users, that you *really nail*.
[22:03:15] <feep> if you can beat the wib on that metric, you'll win in the longterm, at least on the wib theory, there's different reasons why you might lose but they're not relevant to the wib model
[22:03:20] <PapuaHardyNet> there are viable competitors to 4chan
[22:03:22] <mst> ggreer: although I often find myself using rotation lock because I -wanted- landscape or whatever
[22:03:22] <gwern> feep: I think it is. the lightweight crude simplicity of getting *most* of the job done lets it go viral and be adopted and then everyone just bites the bullet in improving the shitty prototype
[22:03:36] <PapuaHardyNet> they just don't have the posts per hour that 4chan does, and that is a good thing
[22:03:39] <feep> right, but I think also no
[22:03:41] <ggreer> on ios, rotation lock only locks to portrait mode
[22:03:45] <dbohdan> gwern: With graphs, though, exposing the abstraction may be a good idea if you do it visually and find a pretty and performant planar visualization.  Twitter threads would be easier to follow with a graph view, for example.
[22:03:54] <feep> 4chan would not be ... like, being graph based would do exactly zero in making 4chan provide more value to its users
[22:03:57] <gwern> feep: a design like imageboards/4chan gets you *most* of the way to a plaza/warren amplifier design, and then they just bear it and patch around it with additional archives and wikis to preserve posts, chat channels etc

[22:06:08] <dbohdan> feep: lol
[22:06:13] <gwern> 4chan gives you an explicit formal hierarchy in terms of board / thread, and then users hack on additional informal levels
[22:06:33] <feep> yes, but I don't think explicit levels would give you value

[23:18:21] <dbohdan> 'It is commonly said that the problem with tripcodes is that they are insufficiently cryptographically secure, providing only a 54-bit keyspace, and are thus vulnerable to brute-force attack (systematic guessing). A number of "secure tripcode" schemes have been proposed to add cryptographic strength in various ways.'  'This view is all wrong. Tripcode strength is perfectly adequate. A tripcode functions like the lock on your front door: it only needs 
[23:18:21] <dbohdan> to keep out casually mischievious people, because there are social mechanisms to take care of people who circumvent it. If someone breaks into your house, the police will catch them and throw them in jail. Likewise, if someone is assuming others' identities on 4chan, the moderators will catch them and ban them. (By most measures, 4chan moderators are more vigilant and responsive than the average police force.)'  This was never convincing to me
[23:19:09] <dbohdan> Insecure tripcodes were either trivial to break in 2008 or became so soon afterwards
[23:19:32] <Ralith> imageboard operators are pretty much exactly the population that knows enough about crypto to get themselves in trouble and no more

[23:20:12] <dbohdan> *meanings of
[23:20:41] <dbohdan> To avoid impersonation it is better to have no tripcode at all than one that is insecure
[23:21:35] <mst> I still love that somebody did an analysis and all the Q tripcodes statistically matched keyboard smash
[23:22:24] <shawwwn> I mean, tripcodes are just HMAC by another name

[23:42:50] <gwern> 'Among smart people who have looked seriously at the problem and are acting in good faith, I see broad near-universal agreement that this is a huge problem, with the main differences being between the ‘this is a huge problem but we can probably figure something out that holds onto the majority of the future’s value, and it’s unlikely that we all die’ camp and the ‘this is a huge...

[23:48:09] <feep> this is based on .... okay, first the grail quest argument, apropos, where getting interpretability almost right but not quite will leave you in turbo hell

[23:48:16] <PapuaHardyNet> it wasn't a monkeys paw up until the end of the third holy grail war

[23:52:02] <rmmh> all I want is tests with 100% accuracy, is that too much to ask
