[00:00:51] <seebs> I assume you mean "distribution across computers"? Go will do any at all amount of distribution of workloads across CPU in a given program, but it doesn't try to deal with programs on other machines.
[00:00:58] <foobaz> oliv3: if chrom[i] is 0 and solution[1] is 255, does that mean high fitness or low fitness?
[00:01:26] <oliv3> seebs: distribution across computers yep
[00:01:58] <seebs> Yeah, that's basically out of scope. Like, there's things for doing it, but they're a higher level than the language is aiming to solve.
[00:02:30] <oliv3> foobaz: chrom[i]==0 and solution[i]==255 means it's the worst guess, so score should be (255-(255-0))^2 => 0
[00:02:50] <oliv3> chrom[i]==255 and solution[i]==255 means it's the best guess, so score should be (255-(255-255))^2 => 65535
[00:03:14] <seebs> this implies that, for solution[i]=128, there is no guess which is even significantly bad
[00:03:18] <oliv3> seebs: sure, i understand Go is not meant for distribution
[00:03:40] <seebs> because you can't beat 1/4 of the badness of a bad score for solution[i]=0 or solution[i]=255.
[00:03:54] <seebs> that seems counterintuitive to me
[00:04:24] <oliv3> well, chrom[i]=0 and solution[i]=128 means you are halfway to the right value
[00:04:26] <seebs> go is somewhat meant for distributed work, and is used for it a lot... it's just that the language itself does not provide that, or tell you how it will work, because the language assumes that you have your own preferences in that matter.
[00:04:44] <foobaz> i still recommend trying fitness += SOMECONST / (delta * delta)
[00:04:47] <seebs> yeah, but for solution[i]=128, nothing can be *less* than halfway to the right value, so that produces a weird difference between things.
[00:05:09] <oliv3> seebs: Erlang has built-in concurrency *and* distribution ;)
[00:05:13] <seebs> yes
[00:05:29] <oliv3> not saying it's better in any way
[00:05:44] <seebs> and if for some reason your assumptions or preferences are not the same as the language's for what distribution looks like or how it works, you might have a problem... :P
[00:05:55] <seebs> it's very good for the things it's designed for, by most accounts.
[00:05:59] <oliv3> but Go's goroutines and channels are obviously taken from Erlang :)
[00:06:07] <seebs> they are in fact not!
[00:06:08] <oliv3> one one machine
[00:06:10] <seebs> they are taken from CSP
[00:06:17] <seebs> well, channels are

[00:06:50] <seebs> goroutines are just generic lightweight-threads.
[00:07:10] <seebs> i'd definitely agree that the devs were *aware* of erlang, though, i just think they probably had a lot of other influences also.
[00:07:12] <foobaz> surely goroutines are from CSP too, given their name
[00:07:22] <foobaz> knuth didn't invent the term coroutine but he certainly popularized it
[00:07:49] <seebs> goroutines aren't coroutines, although they are sometimes similar
[00:07:53] <seebs> i sometimes really wish go had coroutines
[00:08:30] <seebs> there is a category of problem for which "yield to another control flow which then yields back to you" is much, much, simpler to write and reason about than things like iterator objects which store their state explicitly.
[00:08:37] <seebs> and where the locking overhead of channels sucks.

[00:09:44] <seebs> i never really got into erlang, but i get along with C and Go pretty well, and didn't hate what i saw of erlang, just didn't need what it does

[00:10:34] <seebs> basically, what i really want is the ability to have another goroutine that i can just trade the P over to without having to deal with locking overhead. i have toyed with syntaxes for representing this and they've all been ugly.
[00:11:15] <A_Dragon> why does it need to be another goroutine?
[00:11:34] <foobaz> i'd like syntax to indicate a function or value can only be used on a certain thread or user-defined class of threads

[00:52:23] <seebs> It doesn't necessarily need to be "another goroutine", but the utility is specifically that it's a thing which is definitionally paused until we yield to it, so there's no need for a locking mechanism.
[00:52:28] <seebs> So, more like coroutines.

[18:19:08] <dngray[m]> ah right.
[18:19:20] <dngray[m]> yeah that tutorial looks a bit dated

[18:20:50] <dngray[m]> mm so in that example there https://github.com/kirklewis/go-template-processing
[18:21:13] <dngray[m]> would that be `go mod init src/demo/template`
[18:22:40] <j416> dngray[m]: the name doesn't matter
[18:22:56] <j416> dngray[m]: as long as it doesn't overlap with another module name
[18:23:09] <dngray[m]> oh, so it's not about telling it where the module is.
[18:23:35] <j416> go mod init foo  just sets _your_ module name to foo
[18:23:44] <j416> i.e., the module of the code you are writing
[18:24:38] <j416> it needs to be a module for Go to be able to add dependencies, which it does by modifying go.mod, which is what "go mod init" creates
[18:25:01] <dngray[m]> an yeah i noticed the last part
[18:25:54] <j416> if you're writing something that you'll be publishing, use a module name that's globally unique (include e.g. github.com/yourname, or use a domain you own, or such)
[18:26:14] <dngray[m]> yeah that does make sense
[18:26:23] <j416> go get/go install does have magic to figure out from where to fetch a module based on its name, though.
[18:26:58] <dngray[m]> hmm ☹️ still not working i'm still getting: main.go:4:2: package demo/template is not in GOROOT (/usr/lib/go/src/demo/template)
[18:26:59] <j416> it works for the common hosting sites (like github), but if you have your own domain you'd want to set that up so that it works (google vanity URLs or such and you should find some info)
[18:27:02] <dngray[m]> even though i ran: go mod init go-template-processing/demo/template
[18:27:12] <dngray[m]> maybe they wrote some old code that doesn't work anymore
[18:27:42] <dngray[m]> j416: yeah i think it will be a while till i'm proficient enough to publish go code that i am comfortable with 😀
[18:28:16] <j416> not quite sure what you're doing, but if your code is correct with the correct imports, try 'go mod tidy'
[18:28:39] <j416> it should fetch any dependencies and also update your go.sum

[18:30:57] <bpalmer> dngray[m]: so in that repo, you have a main.go which imports "demo/template" which should refer to the code in src/demo/template/template.go
[18:31:12] <dngray[m]> yeah that's what i would have thought
[18:31:33] <dngray[m]> (it's src/demo/template/process.go)

[18:32:01] <dngray[m]> but yeah, still keeps giving me: main.go:4:2: package demo/template is not in GOROOT (/usr/lib/go/src/demo/template)
[18:32:16] <dngray[m]> how does it know about the src directory i wonder?
[18:32:37] <j416> dngray[m]: so if you did "go mod init github.com/kirklewis/go-template-processing", the import path in main.go would be "github.com/kirklewis/go-template-processing/src/demo/template".
[18:32:56] <j416> dngray[m]: that src dir is not your src dir, but go's.
[18:32:57] <bpalmer> dngray[m]: so if you 'go mod init foo'  in the directory where main.go  is, change it to import 'foo/src/demo/template'
[18:33:13] <dngray[m]> that might be where the issue is

[18:33:33] <dngray[m]> they've set it just to: 	"demo/template"
[18:33:34] <bpalmer> dngray[m]: you'll have to modify the path main.go tries to import.
[18:33:36] <j416> that's what we're trying to tell you.
[18:33:40] <dngray[m]> right
[18:34:24] <bpalmer> dngray[m]: this tutorial does seem to predate widespread module usage.
[18:34:34] <dngray[m]> right.
[18:34:44] <j416> dngray[m]: note also that what you are referring to as "this module" is a file in what in Go is called a "package"

[20:02:55] <dngray[m]> all this time, all i needed was `{{ .note }}`
[20:03:56] <dngray[m]> that there `{{ range $value := (index (index .shell 0 ) "tz" ) }}` does feel like such a weird syntax heh
[20:04:51] <dngray[m]> `{{ range index .shell 0 "tz" }}` does look nicer 😀
[20:05:01] <dngray[m]> i felt weird having the two indexes
[20:05:49] <Tv_> dngray[m]: that doesn't seem to need even a single `index` call, `index` is when you need variables

[20:06:17] <dngray[m]> oh yeah that's right because in the example i was mucking about with i wanted to choose element 1

[23:56:02] <bookworm> XD
[23:56:15] <bookworm> tab groups, use em
[23:56:36] <A_Dragon> Tv_: chrome?
[23:56:39] <bookworm> that way you can cram even more tabs in there,  but at least they are sorted
[23:56:52] <A_Dragon> I like that ff doesnt make them silly small when I open 200 tabs

[23:59:53] <Tv_> i feel like making a right-pad.js npm troll that detects if a page has been open & idle for >2h and starts playing random fart noises tens of seconds apart
