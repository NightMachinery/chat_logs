[03:53:08] <creature> So I have a Linux server. I use it as a file server, the files have been moved around from system to system for a few years. Right now it's on Ext4. Every so often I find some files - AFAIK always old files - that seem to have corrupted filenames. They always seem to be uppercase, with a tilde then one character. (eg. MBTLF3~Y.PDF). AFAICS the data itself is fine.
[03:53:33] <creature> I have no idea what would cause this, or what I would Google to look into it, or if it's anything I should worry about. (Open to suggestions!)
[03:54:14] <companion_cube> did they live on ntfs at some point?
[03:54:54] <creature> I don't think so. They 100% have never been on a Windows machine. They did do a Linux server → external HD → Linux server trip, but I'm 99% sure I would have formatted that external drive as ext4 too.
[03:55:31] <companion_cube> in my experience the ~ is an artefact of fat/ntfs
[03:55:41] <companion_cube> although I haven't used that in a long time
[03:55:55] <companion_cube> (are they executable, too?)
[03:57:40] <creature> Huh! They are not, but I just found a pretty cool clue. Probably the cause.
[03:58:37] <creature> To check if they're executable, I SSHed to the server to ls the files. And in that view, the filenames are fine. But that's not how I normally see them: I samba-mount them onto my (macOS) desktop machine.
[03:58:50] <MattWThomas> hi
[03:59:04] <creature> And this filename has a colon. I bet you the "corrupted filenames" are really "filenames with characters that whatever macOS uses doesn't support, or Samba doesn't support", and so it's showing a FAT-style fallback.
[03:59:37] <MattWThomas> I made an unofficial apt repo for zoom on Ubuntu/Debian
[04:00:21] <creature> (I just confirmed a bunch of other colon-containing filenames showing up this way. It's the colons!)

[22:04:00] <mocx> Does anyone have a similar experience with contributing to FOSS: I would like to contribute a patch for a popular project that parses html to obtain tokens for authentication. This project also parses xml and json, however it does not execute javascript. Modern html payloads will contain js and then append or render forms using js making it difficult to grab these tokens.
[22:05:58] <mocx> My proposed solution to this was first to open up the token parsing logic to a more public method. However the more I thought about it, a better solution would be to just enable operation with a browser using standardized apis.
[22:07:08] <mocx> Anyways I’ve opened the proper channels for issues and discussion and gotten an initial response, reviewed the similar issues and proposed some solutions. Nothing but silence for well over a month now.
[22:08:13] <mocx> And on the contribute page, they specify they would like a solution to this exact issue: interoperability with UI
