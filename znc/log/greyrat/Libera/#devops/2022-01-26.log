[00:17:22] <Deknos> i talked about nerdctl not about docker on mac
[00:18:12] <kubblai> its the licensing Deknos

[00:20:13] <rawtaz> oh that was kubblai sorry
[00:20:13] <kubblai> but i just switched to rancher desktop and nerdctl is nice
[00:20:25] <rawtaz> kubblai: what about the licensing?
[00:20:50] <kubblai> they made it so if you have a certain number of employees or turnover you gotta pay for docker-desktop
[00:22:13] <kubblai> they have a grace period which runs out on monday rawtaz 
[00:24:05] <rawtaz> right. but i mean, if you have that size of a company, how is it a problem to pay for that stuff?
[00:24:26] <kubblai> but why pay for it when there are alternatives?

[00:25:23] <rawtaz> why pay? to help sustain docker and its services of course.
[00:25:36] <rawtaz> its not like a company of that size cant easily afford that
[00:25:49] <kubblai> its not really that, they've been removing and mometizing features for years. i get they need to make money but i dont like it
[00:26:05] <rawtaz> yeah, what else do you expect them to do to make the business sustainable?
[00:26:15] <rawtaz> it costs *a lot* to run that stuff
[00:26:34] <rawtaz> just imagine how insanely many people pull insane amounts of images and data for example
[00:27:26] <rawtaz> docker has done so much for this ecosystem and it needs to stick around for a while
[00:27:38] <kubblai> i dont know the solution really. i understand that too but i've worked at a few small companies and they've changed stuff for pulling thats affected us when we couldnt get budget for their paid stuff

[13:36:18] <Deknos> rawtaz, regarding consultant: i know here in the next bigger city a few consultancy firms which use opensource for their tasks.. as long as the do not have to pay... centos on the server, gitlab community edition, terraform/nomad.. but would you think, they pay for example gitlab licenses? or sponsor at least ONE opensource project they care about?
[13:36:20] <Deknos> no
[13:36:46] <Deknos> it's the other way round: ah there's a paid feature, how can we do that with the community edition also and publish that work
[13:37:22] <Deknos> i mean, even when they say, okay, let's buy at least one license to support the company or the developers... or host a public docker instance... nooooo
[13:37:59] <Deknos> 1 of 5 of these companies paid at least the thunderbird/gpg guys for a feature, and that was still dirt cheap, regarding what they got and what you pay for other stuff.
[13:38:50] <Deknos> but these consultancy companies make MAD money
[13:38:57] <Deknos> it's really disillusioning
[13:59:31] <rawtaz> Deknos: its not the consultants that should pay for that usage, it's the customers that actually have it on their systems. i think its good that the consultants recommend and install the open source software, but in the end the customer should pay (which they probably need to be reminded of).
[13:59:48] <kwilczynski> What is going on here!
[13:59:55] <kwilczynski> :>
[14:00:00] <kwilczynski> What is this commotion!
[14:00:05] <kwilczynski> <3
[14:00:23] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: I blame you. For going to bed at 4am because someone showed me The Room.
[14:00:41] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Don't show me things. It makes me loose on sleep :P
[14:01:28] <Deknos> well customers often enough pay more here for opensource as they at least pay redhat or suse. and since consultants make hefty bucks on using and selling stuff with opensource, they should support the ecosystem also.
[14:06:44] <kwilczynski> Deknos: The reality is, sadly, as you know... As Open Source developer you are expected to put up free time and hours and your talent for the benefit of the enterprises!
[14:08:00] <kwilczynski> For example, GitLab came to me, took my small project and made it part of the core. Then they complained that my CI is not working (which is after Travis CI went retarded - I am not going to pay $70 USD for CI minutes out of my own pocket for a free FOSS project).
[14:08:26] <kwilczynski> So then I asked GitLab "Can I have some free CI minutes on GitLab then".
[14:08:28] <kwilczynski> HAHA
[14:08:31] <kwilczynski> Fat chance.
[14:08:54] <kwilczynski> So yeah. Fuck all of the fucking abusers of the FOSS maintainers.
[14:09:32] <shad> I'm more or less OK with the sentiment that FOSS maintainers are getting fucked, but there's something y'all forget to mention
[14:09:51] <shad> free software comes as is, and has no warranty at all. Company pay for that warranty
[14:10:21] <shad> if your foss project crashes the production of a cie you ain't responsible for that, their loss ain't yours
[14:11:23] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: haha did you get it? :)
[14:13:01] <rawtaz> Deknos: you cant seriously suggest that if a consultant helps a customer use a bunch of open source software on servers, services, etc, the consultant should pay the projects or similar? why wouldnt the customer who actually uses the software etc be the one supporting the projects? i agree that it wouldnt make much of a difference, but it would make the customers more aware of the positives of open source, the fact that theyre actually using it (which might sur
[14:14:12] <rawtaz> one example of how customers can "pay" for it is e.g. when they use OPNsense they can buy support packages every year. that way they support the project but also can get some real support when needed. and this will all still be cheaper than any sophos or whatever license and support they have :)
[14:14:28] <rawtaz> im seriously pondering going that route with some users of OSS that i have
[14:15:23] <Deknos> no *pay projects* but support them at least a little bit. and if customer and consultants both would support the projects a little bit, the situation would be indeed much better
[14:17:00] <Deknos> but funnily it's the other way round. consultants open issues with feature requests and bug issues, but often do not really support the projects :D

[14:41:52] <kwilczynski> shad: True. Sadly there is, unfortunately, enough of entitled clueless morons out there in all the these companies, especially on the business side, who then even have audacity to threaten you if your free project caused them issues.
[14:42:13] <kwilczynski> shad: An example of that, and a rather amusing one due to the project wide-spread usage, is curl.

[22:28:48] <pyzozord> aw, you destroyed my renewed hopes
[22:29:43] <dodo> i'm just confused if the container runs its own docker.. i thought it would just use the host.. maybe the inner containers are just hidden.. don't know enought about docker..
