[06:01:31] <tusko> I keep getting disconnected from one IRC network, but another is remaining connected, both are going over Tor via the same ZNC server
[06:01:52] <tusko> Network 1 is connected, but Network 2 disconnects and reconnects frequently.
[06:07:10] <Khaytsus> Bummer, but it's not znc.  Most likely network 2 is having issues?
[06:07:40] <MetaNova> or tor just doesn't like that network
[06:07:48] <MetaNova> or that network just doesn't like tor

[06:24:04] <WildMan> hello
[06:24:38] <WildMan> did anyone noticed that oidentd configs provided on wiki.znc are not quite accurate ?
[06:25:06] <MetaNova> the instructions function as intended
[06:25:10] *** Quits: kronox (~kronox@gateway/tor-sasl/kronox) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:25:11] <MetaNova> what do you think is inaccurate?
[06:26:52] <WildMan> /msg *identfile setformat global { reply "%user%" } <---- in some cases especially when virtual interfaces are used or VPN it will always reply "user[account name that runs the znc procces]" instead desired identd
[06:27:57] <MetaNova> if you simply want the defined ident to be replied you don't even need *identfile
[06:28:11] <MetaNova> or, just specify %ident% instead of %user%
[06:28:44] <MetaNova> specifying %user% on that page is intentional, as it has often been asked, "how can I prevent ident responses from being changed?"
[06:28:45] <WildMan> I need it because i run one znc procces with multiple users added .. so I need each user to have his own ident that was set :)
[06:29:07] <MetaNova> then forcing the ident of %user% seems exactly what you need
[06:29:09] <WildMan> yes the fix was to change %user% to %ident%
[06:29:22] <MetaNova> *shrug*
[06:29:32] <MetaNova> if that's what you want and you knew how to do it then, great
[06:29:35] <WildMan> it works with %user% if there is only one user added :\
[06:30:22] <MetaNova> it works with %user% regardless of how many ZNC users are defined
[06:30:57] <MetaNova> if your instance did not, then, I expect you configured something wrong
[06:31:12] <MetaNova> such as not editing the oident.conf file/restarting the daemon afterwards
[06:32:38] <WildMan> it was all set :P I am using znc since "forever" today was the first time when this happened to me ..because i`ve started to avoid adding new account/editing oidentd.conf in my box for each znc client

[07:05:08] <MetaNova> multiple system users/multiple ZNC instances are not needed with %user% if things are configured correctly/things are functioning as expected

[23:56:23] <Wollino> how to use it?
[23:59:35] <MetaNova> Wollino: so, I have several immediate thoughts
[23:59:57] <MetaNova> 1) you should be using the *sasl module for SASL auth anyway (does new freenode really not support it? have you tried?)
