[00:58:02] <MatthiasVance> Old news
[00:58:17] <bomb> yeah, like 2 hours old :P
[00:58:21] <MatthiasVance> Well, no
[00:58:25] <MatthiasVance> Like 2 days old
[00:59:10] <bomb> https://nltimes.nl/2021/12/18/netherlands-enter-4-week-lockdown-sunday-sources
[01:00:28] <MatthiasVance> I live in NL remember
[01:00:30] <MatthiasVance> =)
[01:00:59] <MatthiasVance> But yeah the decision was communicated today, at like 7pm local time :D
[01:02:31] <bomb> now it's even more suspicious
[01:02:39] <bomb> why didn't you tell use you're working wor the government?
[01:02:49] <bomb> s/wor/for/
[01:07:58] <MatthiasVance> Plans had leaked like some time last week
[01:08:14] <MatthiasVance> Daycare is staying open though ðŸŽ‰
[01:08:31] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: if bomb says 2 hours, it's 2 hours, dammit
[01:09:05] <MatthiasVance> Fuck you, I'm the one in lockdown :P
[01:09:16] <MatthiasVance> Pulling rank here
[01:09:45] <MatthiasVance> Also what level of help do I need if I think of Excel as a project planning tool
[01:10:18] <MatthiasVance> Not software engineering though. More like, lists of stuff that needs doing with extra data.. we're doing another remodel :o
[01:10:21] <JakeSays> lol
[01:10:44] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: then use an actual planning tool :;p
[01:10:53] <MatthiasVance> It's not about dates
[01:10:59] <MatthiasVance> Those are less important until .. way later
[01:11:06] <JakeSays> doesnt matter
[01:11:11] <MatthiasVance> hm, any suggestions ?
[01:11:28] <JakeSays> ugh. no. i can't think of the names
[01:12:01] <MatthiasVance> What would a "real" planning tool give me?
[01:12:15] <JakeSays> lists and shit. lol
[01:12:24] <JakeSays> you know, like trello or whatever its called
[01:12:37] <MatthiasVance> I'd need way too much data on a card
[01:12:51] <MatthiasVance> And sometimes you want to view things by room, other times per project (like isolation)
[01:12:57] <MatthiasVance> But still want to view by room to see if anything bites
[01:15:06] <MatthiasVance> for the actual planning I might use something else yeah, like Outlook :p

[11:20:29] <ayrus> Please help.
[11:22:10] <moose> Well you shouldn't do that anyway, because it's not secure.
[11:32:31] <ayrus> moose: yes, true. the SSL is being used in the private IP and not exposed to the internet. the third party is having the private ca certificate and he is saying to ignore.
[11:32:46] <ayrus> moose: cURL requests are working with -k
[11:32:54] <moose> Yeah and as a professional you should recommend against that :)

[11:46:24] <moose> Try both at the same time
[11:49:30] <moose> But anyway if you're on .NET Core you need to use the HttpClientHandler

[13:30:35] <ayrus> MatthiasVance: https://paste.ofcode.org/UyyJJjhx9vmTLQTGZTRNXD it's the certificate
[13:30:36] <MatthiasVance> Also the situation is not that your code verifies the certificate
[13:30:47] <MatthiasVance> The certificate is irrelevant here, unless it's a client certificate
[13:31:08] <ayrus> I have tried returning true directly without using the if certificate as well.
[13:31:34] <MatthiasVance> Stop
[13:31:39] <MatthiasVance> Please read what I type
[13:31:48] <MatthiasVance> Do you know what a client certificate is?
[13:32:27] <ayrus> we don't have client certificate.
[13:33:08] <MatthiasVance> Okay
[13:33:14] <MatthiasVance> Then the issue is not with your code most likely
[13:33:15] <ayrus> that is why we are trying to ignore the certificate.
[13:33:36] <ayrus> with python response = requests.post('https://x.x.x.x/API/OBC/getSourceCountries', headers=headers, data=data, verify=False)
[13:33:44] <ayrus> it's working
[13:33:57] <ayrus> and even with curl with option -k it's working.
[13:34:13] <MatthiasVance> I wonder if .NET has a different default set of versions / algorithms
[13:34:14] <phrosty> what is the exception you get?
[13:34:17] <MatthiasVance> Are you using it on the same machine?
[13:34:25] <ayrus> phrosty: https://paste.ofcode.org/4Hy3YUDSZ64cYKwK5RrV67
[13:34:38] <ayrus> MatthiasVance: yes, on the same machine, same host, same container.
[13:34:49] <phrosty> this is not a cert error
[13:34:53] <phrosty> this is a network error
[13:35:00] <phrosty> "Connection reset by peer" indicates the server killed the connection
[13:35:08] <MatthiasVance> phrosty: I have been saying this :D
[13:35:14] <MatthiasVance> But maybe your wording helps!
[13:35:27] <phrosty> :D
[13:35:31] <ayrus> it
[13:35:40] <ayrus> it's also mentioning the The SSL connection could not be established
[13:35:50] <ayrus> why it's trying for SSL connection
[13:36:01] <ayrus> bit confused :(
[13:36:03] <MatthiasVance> Because it's using a certificate..
[13:36:05] <phrosty> it couldn't be established because the server closed the connection mid-handshake
[13:36:27] <phrosty> do you have server logs you can look at?
[13:37:04] <ayrus> I want to ignore the certificate, I want C# should just forget about certificate if I'm trying to ignore. why it's creating a SSL Handshake
[13:37:21] <MatthiasVance> ayrus: You are not ignoring the certificate, you are only ignoring the *validity* of the certificate.
[13:37:39] <MatthiasVance> If you don't want to set up a SSL connection, why use HTTPS?
[13:37:45] <ayrus> phrosty: I'm running this on ubuntu machine inside docker container.
[13:38:18] <ayrus> MatthiasVance: I have got this URL from a client and they are not willing to remove the Certificate. The same question I asked them.
[13:38:27] <MatthiasVance> ayrus: Indeed. Because why would they
[13:38:40] <MatthiasVance> ayrus: But you have to understand that since it's HTTPS it will *always* use SSL/TLS
[13:38:49] <phrosty> you could load up Wireshark and see what the packet data looks like
[13:39:04] <ayrus> yes, they have shown the curl requests in their logs and telling its working and fix your code.
[13:39:15] <ayrus> now, I'm stuck :(
[13:40:14] <MatthiasVance> "It might be a combination of supported TLS version and / or algorithms"
[13:40:17] <phrosty> try putting this at the start of your app: AppContext.SetSwitch("System.Net.Http.UseSocketsHttpHandler", false);
[13:40:45] <ayrus> right now, I have asked them for the certificate and I'm going to put the certificate in the server level. Might be it will resolve the issue as it would be added in the trusted certificate.

[22:17:17] <sysRPL> Node.Parse('   '); // Node.Count = 0 now
[22:17:45] <sysRPL> i think it's called defensive programming
[22:18:20] <sysRPL> that is, you assume in every method and every function that the arguments are invalid or the state of the object is invalid
[22:18:25] <biberu> that doesn't like an error with that model though, and nothing that the caller would have to act upon
[22:19:09] <biberu> you're basically just discarding a token and proceeding
[22:19:20] <sysRPL> and then only proceed after verifying the arguments and object state are valid. if neither pass then just exit and continue
[22:20:19] <sysRPL> and if the user want to check validity, he can access the type or object being used himself
[22:20:42] <biberu> i think that is a separate issue?
[22:21:22] <biberu> fwrite(...); <- that's scary
[22:21:24] <sysRPL> using code like ... if Rect.Empty, if Vector.Length > 0, if MyString.Length > 0 and so on
[22:22:51] <sysRPL> in this way, all the code is handled the same. that is you always write code to check values of objects or types, rather than check returns value or try to check exceptions
[22:23:21] <sysRPL> but that only applies to code i write and use, not 3rd party code i use
[22:23:37] <biberu> i try to do neither of those
[22:23:58] <sysRPL> you never check object state or the state of types?
[22:25:16] <biberu> most of my own code is fp oriented, so i'd e.g. avoid mutating state, and the result of a function that can fail would probably be a maybe/either
[22:26:12] <biberu> that way i'm forced to handle errors before i can access values, discarding becomes irrelevant

[22:26:36] <sysRPL> consider this example, a button is clicked and you have a method to handle the event (a delegate in c#). in the button click you gather the state of the ui and send that data to a server.
[22:27:52] <sysRPL> the state of the ui might include a text box with a name, a combo box with a list of possible values, and multi line message field
[22:28:40] <sysRPL> i would have some code that check each of those states (name, combo, multi line text) before sending that data to the server
[22:29:53] <sysRPL> and if those fields were invalid i wouldn't return an error code or throw an exception. instead i'd have code to set the input focus and perhaps highlight and describe the problem to the user
[22:30:34] <biberu> i'd structure that so that the ui is just a dumb rendering of the state of the application, that emits events in response to user actions
