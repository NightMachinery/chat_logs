In the program I'm doing a stat on stdin and I see the type is FIFO as expected, it has read privileges on user and group and this process is running as the user and group owned by the pipe, any idea what else I might cause a bad file descriptor?

[01:07:50] <uwharrie> you shouldn't have other processes asking for elevated privs if you didn't originally launch them that way
[01:08:06] <Dagmar> So if it's using sudo, replace sudo with a wrapper that gives you credit for inventing the linux and then calls the real sudo

[09:20:03] <Dagmar> Cold_Cat: If you'd ever gone to take a tour of a power plant, you would have known better than to think that
[09:20:16] <TheGibson> So, to get the job, the analyst has to have 1-3 certs, usually, and X number of skills.
[09:20:28] *** Joins: c4017w__ (~c4017@209.52.68.8)

[09:21:27] <TheGibson> They say there's a shortage of security jobs. That's not really true. There's a shortage of security jobs based on a standard developed that doesn't address the situation.

[09:22:14] <TheGibson> I seriously don't go to work

[09:24:35] <Dagmar> I did some years in a NOC (_after_ having a CISSP) just because it let me have 8 hours a night basically glued to an I2 backbone
[09:24:55] <Dagmar> There was talk about why I was always typing, never "being caught napping" like some of the other guys
[09:25:07] <TheGibson> what is the I2?

[09:26:08] <Dagmar> If a place has an I2 connection, it's a near guarantee that it's got three other uplinks
[09:26:15] <TheGibson> I honestly don't get the CISSP. It's popular but it seems more like a CISO things ...
[09:26:25] <Dagmar> Pffft.  I wish

[09:28:36] <Cold_Cat> oh! sweet! Arch is done downloading and now I'm seading it for others
[09:28:38] <TheGibson> I think helpdesk is basically the technical equivalent of a gerbel on a wheel

[10:00:53] <Dagmar> Slackware _15_ uses snail
[10:00:59] <Dagmar> 14.2 and older use mailx.
[10:01:13] <mlu> I guess I could just pay Google too -- it's the difference between $5/mo and $6/mo

[10:01:54] <lockywolf_> fastmail quite ok
[10:02:02] <znf> at a previous job we were reselling G-Suite, we had some clients paying 20k/mo just for email, that felt crazy to me, but then again, huge company
[10:02:18] <mlu> znf: they paid for the Enterprise Plus?
[10:02:19] <lockywolf_> costs money, but is not blocked by too many countries and supports JMAP
[10:02:23] <znf> mlu, yeah
[10:02:26] <Dagmar> All I could remember was that the maintainer of the source was named "Gunnar" until I looked at the source tree
[10:02:26] <mlu> znf: where they were extracting like $30/mo/user or something?
[10:02:30] <hexnewbie> At least mailx and s-nail have similar arguments, Debian goes to the insanity of using mailutils
[10:02:34] <znf> mlu, extracting?
[10:02:48] <mlu> hmm... my startup used the $12/mo version because we wanted the 2TB/user storage
[10:03:00] *** Joins: zro (~zro@user/zro)
[10:03:04] <znf> ah, I can't recall the specifics
[10:03:06] <mlu> znf: $30/mo/user is definitely enterprisey pricing :)
[10:03:10] <znf> they just had A LOT of users
[10:03:23] <mlu> think it gets you access to a special version of Google Vault that has enhanced auditing capabilities IIRC
[10:03:24] <znf> I think it was a mix of plans, because I recall being able to do that
[10:03:38] <znf> ie: their C-levels had the more pricey plans
[10:03:44] <mlu> they had addon packs

[10:03:49] <znf> I think so

[10:04:15] <mlu> I actually think that GSuite is actually a decent deal for the price
[10:04:30] <mlu> but I think you actually need the top tier to even be able to get phone support
[10:04:43] <znf> We had phone support as a reseller
[10:04:54] <znf> but I do recall it was basically not profitable at all
[10:04:54] <Dagmar> Pretty much the same for O365-ish
[10:04:58] <hexnewbie> I don't actually remember the details, but I do hate all my scripts being broken by my OS switching from one of the mailx variants (not sure if all are usable, either; maybe only the BSD one is), to mailutils

[10:05:51] <Dagmar> hexnewbie: Probably one of the reasons I keep my reliance on it minimal because I know it can't stay that way forever, and now Slackware has gone and switched from mailx to s-nail
[10:06:20] <mlu> it seems like Google uses the resellers similar to how the automakers use dealers
[10:06:21] <znf> At least Microsoft negotiates with resellers
[10:06:27] <Dagmar> I wonder what actually _stopped_ working with mailx to make Pat even care enough about it to switch
[10:06:51] <Dagmar> mlu: THey can't hire that many people.  The US government would freak out

[11:04:12] <Jong> woohoo aws has a web browser based way I can get in
[11:04:13] <colo> Jong, are you authenticating using public keys? if so, your sshd_config maybe has StrictModes in effect, which makes too wide permissions on ~/.ssh/ a non-starter for authentication data.
[11:04:31] <hexnewbie> Jong: Try logging in as root or find if AWS offers any service that allows you edit the disk from outside the VM, or booting from a rescue operating system. Then 1) fix the permissions of /home/ubuntu - particularly /home/ubuntu/.ssh/*** - then upload new /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys

[19:03:46] <Psi-Jack> It's not perfect, by any means, in fact, it's pretty freaking unreliable, but more reliable than a consistent TCP connection that is normally required. At a bare minimum when you're road-warrioring it might be more reliable.
[19:03:52] <joo-_> when i open my terminal and the connection is still alive no matter what, i would refer to that as persistent connection
[19:03:55] <Psi-Jack> But why use it any other time? No freaking clue.
[19:04:04] <Psi-Jack> You'd be incorrect.
[19:04:30] <joo-_> ssh has some persistent connection options, is that why you say it is incorrect ?
[19:04:36] <Psi-Jack> No

[20:40:22] <Psi-Jack> What is your actual question if someone HAS "worked with a RADIUS server?"
[20:40:53] <ayecee> a service receives credentials from a user. it forwards them to a radius server, and the radius server identifies them and determines if they're allowed access, and records their access.

[23:01:10] <ayecee> you'd need to boot from something other than the partition you want to resize.
[23:01:17] <ayecee> no, it wouldn't work.
[23:01:53] <ayecee> not unless you had free space available, and it sounds like you don't.

[23:02:00] <Macwinner> maybe the rescue mode boot could help then?
[23:02:15] <Macwinner> ayecee: I have free space availabe.. most of the disk is free.
[23:02:18] <Macwinner> like 99%
[23:02:22] <ayecee> no, it can't. it still boots from the partition you want to resize.
[23:02:32] <akik> Macwinner: ask your hosting provider for help
[23:02:34] <ayecee> Macwinner: i mean unpartitioned space, not free space on your filesystem.
[23:03:10] <tirnanog> you could try the rescue mode. some hosting companies implement their own system to boot into alternate operating environments.
[23:03:12] <Macwinner> akik: I did.. they changed it from before where they had lvm setup by default.. now I'm on my own.  Will probably switch providers soon.

[23:52:15] <AeroNotix> what language are you trying to use? in the year of our lord, on Earth, in this universe - 2022, I would highly recommend just using nginx and yeeting apache out the nearest airlock
[23:52:23] <Feriun> mrfb: I'm runnig Pop-Os and yes the service is running
[23:52:32] <ayecee> carnophage2: we can't see your screen from here. what did you try, and what happened when you try?

[23:52:49] <AeroNotix> ayecee: what?
[23:52:53] <carnophage2> znf #httpd is dead right now
[23:53:02] <ayecee> AeroNotix: take your webserver evangelism and hit the bricks.
[23:53:13] <znf> also, who the hell runs cgi
[23:53:18] <AeroNotix> apache is absolutely dog tier level software at this point. If you don't NEED it, then a recommendation to use something else will save this person a helluvalotta time
[23:53:22] <carnophage2> I have edited the apache2.conf with the commented last four lines uncommented and nothing worked, etc.
[23:53:29] <mrfb> Feriun: can you share the wifi chipset / model?
[23:53:32] <Feriun> parabyte: How can I check if i've hard locked something?

[23:53:38] <ayecee> carnophage2: what does nothing worked mean here
[23:53:40] <znf> carnophage2, can we see the config, then?
[23:53:56] <jim> znf, I guess nginx does, and things like django do
[23:54:03] <MrElendig> carnophage2: raspbian is dead, switch to raspberrypi os
[23:54:04] <neoncortex> In 2022 you are supposed to run a Javascript backend.  Yeah get on with the times.
[23:54:11] <MrElendig> carnophage2: go for the new 64bit build

[23:56:23] <carnophage2> when I click on them in this directory, it tries to download the file instead of running it as a cgi script
[23:56:26] <znf> "cgi" usually means the server runs the scripts directly
