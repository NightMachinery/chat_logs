Since I switched from windows to Linux a week ago I have used the drive with the veracrypt encryption I used in Windows. It was okay but still was NTFS. So today I backed everything up and created a luks encrypted btrfs partition. When I started to copy the backed up data back the speed went way 
[00:54:22] <Grau> down after 10-20gb copied data. Below 20 mb/s. Not even with the VeraCrypt NTFS it went down that low.

[05:19:43] <MacGyver> And by extension, by not handling USR1 explicitly it kills all your open terminals.
[05:19:57] <MacGyver> Fortunately I was kinda expecting that so had nothing important open.
[05:20:01] <UndeadLeech> There has been a request to support USR1 as alternative iirc. (https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4590)

[05:20:50] <UndeadLeech> It would be a somewhat trivial way to circumvent all those strange scenarios where inotify doesn't work just quite right.
[05:21:25] <b-rex> cool. colors are a little jacked up in tmux but it's doing color emojis
[05:21:46] <MacGyver> (It also might be worth just handling USR1 as a NOOP considering it's seemingly such a standard way of handling reconfiguration that I bet I'm not the first person to inadvertently kill all their terminals)
[05:22:16] <MacGyver> (But actually triggering reconfig is at that point trivial I guess)
[05:22:20] <UndeadLeech> I mean you shouldn't be sending random signals with the default behavior to kill to applications that don't support it.

[11:00:39] <krathalan> Delta[m]: looks good to me. you could use install instead of cp during package() but its not bad to use cp

[12:23:28] <eschwartz> actually, hmm....
[12:23:31] <eschwartz> https://github.com/anbox/anbox/blob/9de4e87cdd05135e1c71e6eadb68bf82719cebdf/external/backward-cpp/BackwardConfig.cmake#L49-L125
[12:23:32] <ahmubashshir> gotta ask anbox maintainers
[12:24:03] <eschwartz> "if autodetecting, check for all 3 of libdwarf, libelf, libbfd"
[12:24:21] <eschwartz> then it prefers libdw, libbfd, libdwarf in that order
[12:24:58] <ahmubashshir> ok...
[12:25:17] <eschwartz> this is actually incredibly hilarious, since libdwarf depends on libelf.so, and libdw/libelf come together
[12:25:54] <ahmubashshir> XD
[12:25:58] <eschwartz> so if you have libdwarf, you have libdw too... it might be impossible to autodetect libdwarf since it always finds libdw first
[12:26:28] <ahmubashshir> well... if it works, don't touch it XD
[12:26:33] <ahmubashshir> I'm going with that
[12:26:33] <eschwartz> unless idk, maybe debian splits libelf into a whole bunch of packages, so you could get libelf but not libdw
[12:27:25] <eschwartz> yes, you get core/libelf (including libdw.so) for free on Arch since it is required by systemd
[12:27:55] <eschwartz> systemd-coredump makes use of libdw too :p

[18:25:33] <majorgreys> Scimmia: trying that again, and refreshing keys. maybe i was incorrectly assuming errors in the output of pacman-key was a bad thing...
[18:26:17] <Scimmia> majorgreys: pacman-key never comes into play here. That's pacman's keyring, makepkg uses the user's keyring
[18:27:53] <majorgreys> ok, do i then need to also update my user gpg.conf with that keyserver?
[18:28:02] <Scimmia> yep

[20:21:58] <Isaac_S> thanks for the help sorry for all the mess (I should've done this in the newbie channel to begin :(  )

[20:23:06] <mingdao> This is it, eh?
[20:23:21] <raster> sometimes is appears to be :)
[20:23:23] <eschwartz> #archlinux-newbie is the channel for being *nice* to newbies :p

[20:25:29] <raster> Isaac_S: the intel driver is separate from the modestting one which is actually a core one. the modern take is you should use modesetting, not the intel driver. but i think for some older hw intel is better. my intel hw is all using modesetting these days.
[20:25:44] <Isaac_S> ohhhhh, i see now
[20:25:45] <raster> MacGyver:  i know... it's a joke :) you know the arch meme :)

[20:26:50] <somercet> FF and chromium show both 100% install rates

[20:33:22] <MacGyver> Well *to be fair* it can be pretty damn hard to get the output of a kernel panic or tail end of a reboot after the disks have already been unmounted in a textual way.

[20:35:19] <Isaac_S> it didn't get used all that much to begin with. It's actually my dad's old business laptop from like 2007 so that might be part of why it lasted so long despite being left in a dusty storage room
