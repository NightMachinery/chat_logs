[00:03:46] <dpk> yeah, heh

[00:05:24] <dpk> sum-measure as defined above
[00:05:34] <Zipheir> Oh, sorry.
[00:06:20] <Zipheir> That would seem to give the wrong answer for the digits of the subtree (since they contain nodes, not elements).

[00:06:49] <dpk> i suspected it lay there but packed in for the day before investigating further
[00:06:56] <dpk> and haven't gone back to it yet
[00:07:01] <Zipheir> OK, no problem.
[00:07:52] <Zipheir> That's what I meant about "tagging every external element and always giving a length of 1 for those."

[13:15:41] <ns12> Hello, is () a non-portable way to represent an empty list in Scheme?
[13:16:19] <ns12> From my understanding, only '() is portable, while () is not. Is that correct?
[13:16:23] <dpk> correct
[13:17:00] <ns12> Was there some kind of controversy that resulted in this situation?
[13:17:41] <dpk> that would be back in the R4RS days, if so, i think
[13:17:47] <dpk> but i'm not entirely sure
[13:18:21] <dpk> early Scheme reports still had the old Lisp type pun of nil being all three of a symbol, the canonical false value, and the empty list
[13:18:49] <ns12> I noticed that Common Lisp has NIL, '() and (), all of which are NIL.
[13:19:28] <dpk> yes, Common Lisp still puns the three together, mainly because Symbolics bullied the committee into keeping it that way so they wouldn't need to change all their code
[13:20:19] <mdhughes> dpk: "truth", the machine translates. So apparently it can count words!
[13:21:36] <mdhughes> Also '#() is a literal vector in R6RS and earlier, and #() is allowed as a self-evaluating literal vector in R7RS.
[13:21:42] <dpk> Sanskrit has nouns and adjectives as a single category, nominals, and an 'adjective' in neuter accusative singular can act as an adverb. so it's meant to be 'truly'
[13:22:10] <dpk> but a machine probably can't tell the two apart — machine translating Sanskrit is probably like machine translating Latin but on steroids
[13:22:13] <mdhughes> I dunno why we can't have () as a literal nil, but we can't.
[13:23:06] <dpk> i think R7RS got it wrong by changing that. i expect literal #(foo) to create me a vector with the value of the variable foo, not the symbol foo
[13:23:18] <dpk> quoting the whole thing makes it clear what goes on

[22:03:56] <tatsumaru> hey guys, what does "a leaky abstraction is an abstraction that leaks details that it is supposed to abstract away" mean? is this the same like side effects?
[22:04:56] <Zipheir> dpk: That's a clever idea which might avoid a lot of unnecessary wrapping/unwrapping.
[22:05:24] <Zipheir> tatsumaru: In a very abstract way, yes.
[22:05:43] <gwatt> tatsumaru: abstractions are supposed to remove implementation details from the user. Leaky abstractions tend to require the user still know how the implementation functions
[22:06:23] <Zipheir> tatsumaru: It might possibly mean something to you to say that, in both cases, you want an isomorphism or homomorphism but don't have one.
[22:07:44] <Zipheir> The first chapter of Seven Sketches in Compositionality talks about precisely this problem: compositional systems versus systems with effects https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316
[22:10:00] <tatsumaru> category theory sounds like something librarians would be really interested in
[22:10:46] <Zipheir> tatsumaru: As a simple example, consider how people often use lists to represent sets.  There are a number of leaks: lists have an ordering which sets do not have, and certain operations on sets don't directly map to lists.
[22:11:18] <tatsumaru> why do people use lists to represents sets instead of sets?
[22:11:49] <gwatt> because it's easy
[22:11:52] <Zipheir> tatsumaru: How do you represent a set?
[22:12:13] <Zipheir> tatsumaru: Fundamentally, you have to choose a representation.
[22:12:23] <tatsumaru> by set do you mean a collection of unique values?
[22:12:39] <Zipheir> Set theory sets.
[22:12:44] *** Joins: seninha (~seninha@user/seninha)
[22:12:48] <ASau> tatsumaru: because you need to implement proper ADT, in the first place.
[22:13:16] <ASau> The latter is not "elementary" Scheme.
[22:13:41] <tatsumaru> sorry some lisps have this set collection type so I thought you were talking about that
[22:14:16] <ASau> Yes, but those "some" have elaborate facilities to build ADTs in language.
[22:16:12] <tatsumaru> what does the term "leak" actually refer to, is it an exception or undesirable consequence of some sort?
[22:17:39] <Zipheir> tatsumaru: It means that there are irrelevant details to take care of.
[22:18:49] <tatsumaru> ah I see, thanks
[22:18:56] <Zipheir> tatsumaru: Like, again, when you use a list as a set and have to remember that list concatenation is not set union.
[22:19:27] <tatsumaru> is this because the representation ADT doesn't match the original concept ideally?
[22:20:23] <tatsumaru> for example if you were using lists to represent lists then you wouldn't have these problems?
[22:20:39] <Zipheir> tatsumaru: Yes.  The precise way to say that is that the representation map is not natural in the sense that transformation and representation don't commute.
[22:21:50] <Zipheir> tatsumaru: You *do* have this problem with Scheme lists, since you have to watch out for improper lists.
[22:23:12] <Zipheir> tatsumaru: Scheme pairs + () could be seen as a representation of the abstract type of lists, but it's leaky in that you can't assume lists are made of lists or are non-circular.
