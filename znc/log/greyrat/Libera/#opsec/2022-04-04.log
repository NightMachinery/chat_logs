[01:53:54] <iz> have you seen that paper where they can create text-to-voice with a voice that sounds like anyone based on just 5 seconds of them talking normally?

[02:05:25] <jan6> have not
[02:06:05] <jan6> I'm pretty sure that has a lot of shortcomings, and is more "voice type" matching than "specific person" matching

[03:35:34] <Joanna> It seems like computer generated voices sound a lot better than they used to. I don’t doubt that the can imitate real people.
[03:39:50] *** Joins: dez (uid92154@user/dez)
[03:43:28] <jan6> "imitate real people" as been possible for decades
[03:44:46] <jan6> "mask over someone allowing them to talk as if they were a specific other person" is another thing entirely
[03:48:54] <jan6> a lot of the "blandness" of generated voices is not because we don't know how to liven it up, it's because the program doesn't know how to properly do it for ANY arbitrary text, I'm sure that even 10 years ago (that'd be like 2012...sheesh time flies) you could do totally passable computer voice, if you were determined to do so
[03:49:25] <iz> listen to the samples on that page.. the 5 second reference and then the synth text-to-speech
[03:50:58] <jan6> but there simply wasn't much reason to do so, since it was "good enough", and mostly used for shorter snippets, and whatnot
[03:51:11] <jan6> yeah sure, they're real good, but the downfalls still apply ;P
[03:51:52] <carnophage2> link?
[03:52:05] <iz> 14:27 < iz> https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/speaker_adaptation/
[03:52:47] <iz> this was from quite a few years ago
[03:52:48] <jan6> e.g. take the first voice's synthesization nr 6, you can clearly hear that it couldn't properly get all the needed stuff for "quest" for example
[03:53:03] <jan6> it's still really impressive, of course
[03:53:07] <jan6> just not perfect
[03:53:31] <iz> yeah, they say the more sample reference they have, the better it gets.. but that's just with only 5 seconds of reference
[03:56:26] <jan6> it also depends IF and HOW MUCH better it gets, and at what cost
[03:56:59] <jan6> e.g. if you start requiring a terabyte of ram to proccess 1 minute of speech, y'know
[03:57:30] <jan6> and it's pretty bad across languages, apparently
[03:57:41] <jan6> also I think I actually HAVE seen it before, just didn't recognize it
[03:58:58] <jan6> also there's different parts to speech, like not only the individual word pronounciation and intonation and flow and whatnot, but also sentence-wide and paragraph-wide stuff
[03:59:35] <Joanna> They can probably fake things that aren’t real-time conversation better
[03:59:42] <jan6> of course
[04:00:13] <Joanna> The first terminator movie had the ability to fake voices...
[04:00:27] <jan6> a lot of the tech is OOOLLDD
[04:00:38] <jan6> especially theory parts
[04:01:48] <Joanna> So for someone to trick you using a synthesizer would they talk as normal and it would change their voice?
[04:02:43] <iz> well, if it were this kind of tech, they would just type what they want to say and it would say it in whatever voice
[04:03:29] <iz> i guess you could do voice-to-text-to-speech though
[04:03:42] <Joanna> So they would have to type very fast and never make mistakeses essentially
[04:05:53] <Joanna> It could be hard to verify who you are talking to unless you can reference things that the imposter doesn’t know about.
[04:06:54] <Joanna> With people sharing so much information online and with their smartphones this is harder than it used to be
[04:09:17] <jan6> the one in my video is exactly the "talk whatever, and it transforms it (live, I think)"
[04:09:28] <jan6> without the text part between
[04:09:45] <jan6> like the tone shifts and whatnot are all kept
[04:13:13] <jan6> also pretty much none of the speech, nor recognition stuff actually REQUIRES text representation
[04:14:11] <jan6> that is just the interface for us to use, because typing phonetically is too tricky for most people, even if it's one of the ascii schemes and nothing extra-fancy like IPA
[04:14:12] <iz> yeah, it can all be encoded from voice also (tone shifts and inflection also)
[04:14:28] <iz> typing isn't really a limiting factor, that's a mislead
[04:15:56] * jan6 still loves the very obviously robotic OLD speech synthesis, like https://github.com/Jan69/SAM
[04:16:12] <jan6> (I only applied some patches, mostly)
[04:17:29] <jan6> pretty tricky to use, and pretty noisy not-that-realistic voice that's sometimes hard to understand, but it's tiny, and cool ;P
[04:29:39] <Joanna> I’ve heard of cases of scammers calling up people and pretending to be someone they know to trick them into sending money. I can’t think of anything to copy someone’s voice for besides fraud.
[04:30:30] <jan6> actors
[04:30:42] <jan6> like they're already doing
[04:30:54] <jan6> just fun, too
[04:30:55] <jan6> etc
[04:31:48] <jan6> a good voice actor could fake the voice ANYWAY, especially over lower quality, like a phone call
[04:32:27] <jan6> and the "dumb" voice changers have been around for a LOOOOONG while
[05:07:56] <Joanna> Actors will have the same fate as musicians
[05:08:42] <Joanna> They will be obsolete
[05:10:56] <jan6> musicians are obsolete in your mind?
[05:10:59] <jan6> pffff
[05:12:38] <Joanna> Try to make a living as one.
[05:12:50] <jan6> just as hard as it's always been
[05:13:09] <jan6> it all depends what, where, how, and who do you know
[05:14:27] <jan6> people are as entitled as ever, and the "starving artist" image fits "starving musician" just as well as a painter or other visual artist
[05:15:20] <Joanna> I’m not happy at all about the fact that people can’t make a living playing music. As far as I’m concerned music has been going downhill since sheet music was invented and accelerated after invention of the phonograph. 
[05:15:26] <jan6> getting started as an artist of ANY kind, has ALWAYS been REALLY hard, the fact that it STILL is, doesn't give you any more "right-ness" about them dying out
[05:15:37] <jan6> people definitely CAN make a living playing music
[05:16:57] <Joanna> There are no musical instrument stores here and most people are not any more interested in learning to play music than they are in making their own clothes.
[05:17:06] <jan6> it just takes a lot of skill and even more dedication, plus also knowing or finding out places that won't scam you for free music, but also, there's non-live music too, you're not limited to purely playing a live concert, or background noise, anymore
[05:17:14] <jan6> MOST people have NEVER been interested
[05:18:07] <jan6> and even back when people DID make, or repair their own clothes, MOST people were never INTERESTED in it, it was just literally the only (cost-effective) way to GET clothes
[05:18:17] <Joanna> Sure the music industry hand picks the puppets they want and promotes them. It doesn’t make for what I consider good music.
[05:18:27] <jan6> also music industry is unrelated
[05:19:37] <jan6> most of their music is written by a tiny handful of guys behind the scenes anyway
[05:19:50] <Joanna> That could be true. Most people are lazy and un creative and would rather be given garbage to wear and listen to.
[05:20:04] <jan6> *most* people have always been, too, y'know
[05:20:37] <Joanna> I wish more people would play their own music for fun really
[05:21:04] <Joanna> Instead of consuming recorded noise
[05:21:05] <jan6> just nowdays it's both easier to SEE/hear the low end of the spectrum, and also easier to not do X thing (e.g. why make your own coffee when you can buy it from someone else?)
[05:22:27] <jan6> own music requires 1) creativity 2) considerable time you wouldn't prefer to do something else and 3) at least one instrument, which melodic instruments tend to not be that cheap, and DIYing is rare, and usually not that great if you don't have a clue of what you're doing
[05:23:15] <Joanna> Most musical instruments sold are electronic one for people that want to be like some idol they saw on tv
[05:23:24] <jan6> time, money, and creativity, in a world running dry of creativity, and constantly accelerating in things you need/want to do in a given time
[05:23:41] <jan6> actually no
[05:24:10] <jan6> you're not including all the ukuleles and stuff, nor the kids toys
[05:25:01] <jan6> and there are plenty of people who're actually using those kids music toys to make music, usually as part of the setup
[05:25:13] <Joanna> Children’s fake musical instruments are garbage. 
[05:25:22] <jan6> depends on the instrument
[05:25:26] <jan6> circuit-bending
[05:25:29] <jan6> circuit-bending is dope
[05:25:40] <carnophage2> Uke has some badass players, Joanna.
[05:25:42] <jan6> make the things make sounds they were never supposed to make
[05:25:47] <carnophage2> Like, serious serious musicians.
[05:25:57] <jan6> a lot of stuff have, carnophage2 
[05:26:18] <Joanna> I only like non electronic instruments. If a ukulele is made correctly it’s ok as well as expensive
[05:26:32] <jan6> there's people who are really good at playing the wildest of things, such as stylophone-masters, or people who can play anything on a "singing calculator"
[05:26:51] <jan6> but 90% of them are NOT, Joanna 
[05:27:17] <jan6> most of them aren't even REMOTELY tuned, nor meant to hold a tuning
[05:27:30] <Joanna> I’d like to have a sitar or koto
[05:28:37] <jan6> go and buy one, only like... $700 or so...https://olddelhimusic.com/collections/sitars-for-sale-in-usa
[05:28:56] <jan6> (on the lower end)
[05:30:36] <carnophage2> what's wrong with electronic instruments?  those can be fun, too.
[05:30:48] <jan6> "not handmade" and stuff probably
[05:30:54] <jan6> it depends on the instrument, honestly
[05:31:01] <jan6> and its quality
[05:31:27] <jan6> self-contained synthesizers can be real fun
[05:31:31] <Joanna> I like acordians
[05:32:06] <jan6> good for you, they sound quite alright, but are not that easy to play
[05:32:57] <Joanna> Maybe after electricity goes away there will be good music again :)
[05:33:15] <jan6> HAH
[05:33:26] <Joanna> I used to play an electric bass guitar
[05:33:34] <jan6> most musicians play songs composed by other people
[05:33:42] <jan6> they won't be able to play AT ALL then
[05:34:19] <Joanna> Yea that’s the problem.
[05:34:53] <Joanna> I played by ear I don’t know how to use sheet music
[05:35:20] <jan6> of course SOME people would also have SOME printed sheets, but nobody keeps random song sheets around for years and years, when it's rarely asked to play, and isn't particularly favourite of the player (in which case they'd probably have it reasonably memorized anyway)

[05:40:11] <Joanna> I never cared about what key I was playing in
[05:45:14] <carnophage2> i write a little music, but it's just for fun.
[05:45:59] <carnophage2> i know i'll never be one of the greats, but it helps my depression.
[05:50:41] <jan6> it's good to music for yourself, and apparently has some benefits (including higher happiness), but if anyone else listens, they'd likely want "proper" stuff, such as reasonably tuned instruments, and reasonably clean intervals and melodies and stuff (like not having another note ram into previous one "halfway through"), even when "just for fun"

[22:46:57] <Joanna> I usually avoid talking to people who pick apart what I’m saying with logic stuff I guess most of human communication is logically flawed
[22:47:59] <Joanna> I particularly hate the correlation is not causation one.
[22:49:42] <iz> that just means you don't like it when ppl point out when you go from A to C and are jumping to conclusions
[22:50:44] <iz> if you can't explain your point logically to someone else, you might not have a valid point, no matter how vividly you feel like you do
[22:52:23] <Joanna> Or it could just be a person protecting financial interests like the tobacco industry.

[22:52:57] <iz> the two things would be mutually exclusive

[22:53:40] <Joanna> It doesn’t do any good to use logic on people because they believe what they believe and aren’t going to change unless forced to.

[22:53:58] <iz> or wait, i mean they aren't
[22:54:45] <iz> the point isn't to trick people into believing things -- it's a method to make inferences and figure out what is true
[22:55:45] <Joanna> Truth is an opinion often times. What religion is true for instance
[22:56:41] <iz> again, unrelated
[22:57:10] <iz> subjective truth still follows logic, unless someone is just willfully ignorant
[22:57:34] <Joanna> Sometimes it is good to jump to conclusions from a survival standpoint. This seems like a good topic for CalimeroTeknik
[22:58:01] <iz> different people can use the same logic operating on different upbringings and backgrounds and come to wildly different truths.. but they all agree that the ideas that break logic are bullshit
[22:58:07] <Joanna> Unrelated is an opinion..
[22:58:13] <jan6> I totally believe Joanna doesn't like logic, because their claims are often huge leaps of logic with not much anything actual to back it ;P
[22:58:37] <iz> yeah, i found her statement very unsurprising
[23:00:02] <iz> and no, character assassination of the opponent won't magically make whatever you said true, no matter how bad they are
[23:00:04] <Joanna> I think of logic as a tool to get around the obvious and distract, I’ll admit some things seem illogical if analyzed enough
[23:00:12] *** Joins: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23)
[23:01:31] <Joanna> If someone is untrustworthy I don’t trust what they say. Yes they could say something true but they are still not trustworthy
[23:02:16] <CalimeroTeknik> Joanna, I don't say that jumping to conclusions is inadequate when you have a split second to respond, but you need to stay aware of your assumptions!
[23:03:34] <CalimeroTeknik> we can use more cost-effective cognitive processes to cut corners, at the cost of making mistakes regularly
[23:04:40] <Joanna> Logic doesn’t seem to be very prevalent in world affairs or most human thought in general. It’s kind of a niche way of thinking. Which is good if you’re a programmer. I noticed that most things didn’t make sense at a very early age.
[23:06:45] <Joanna> Most people just blindly obey instructions from authority figures without question and if it wasn’t this way we wouldn’t have civilization or technology.
[23:16:55] <jan6> almost everything does make sense, if you actually think about it, and have sufficient brain power to think through it
[23:23:33] <Joanna> Most people act similar to a horse panicking over a plastic bag flapping in the wind
[23:24:25] <Joanna> If you see something dangerous better safe than sorry

[23:39:24] <iz> it's a jump of logic to go from "people act illogically sometimes" to arrive at "the entire world is illogical at its core"
[23:53:26] *** Joins: SANCLA (~SANCLA@hackalot/deelnemer/Sancla)
[23:57:49] <CalimeroTeknik> Joanna, logic has this advantage that, relating to reality, it doesn't lead you to conclusions that don't fit what happens, if your observations are correct
[23:57:57] <Joanna> About the example in video about when dog barks she mentions edge conditions of when dog doesn’t bark when it should or barks when it shouldn’t, but the fact is that humans have been using guard dogs for thousands of years and they are fairly reliable.
[23:59:35] <CalimeroTeknik> if you're interested in the details of why it's not a perfect fit (like with the dogs), you have to use meta-cognition
[23:59:43] <CalimeroTeknik> thinking about how we think
[23:59:56] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: my main problems have been being taught information which is either useless or incorrect and having to discover this the hard way.
