[00:33:47] <adiabatic> ggreer: also: the surveillance state that they have, we pretty much have, except it's "private"
[00:34:19] <ggreer> not nearly to the same extent. in china they can track everyone everywhere. no private company can do that (at least, not yet)
[00:34:30] <adiabatic> china 'just' does more with their surveillance…at least so far
[00:34:50] <adiabatic> to a lot of people, this is a difference of degree more than kind
[00:36:06] <kuudes> are they those people who yearn for "enlightened dictatorship"?
[00:36:21] <kuudes> ie "dictators are more efficient" etc
[00:36:55] <adiabatic> well, if you live in an inefficient dictatorship, an efficient dictatorship sounds like a huge step up
[00:37:02] <ggreer> I mean... I've spent 3 weeks in china and the level of surveillance is insane. it was "papers please" everywhere. most of the west was blocked, and VPNs had to be licensed by the state (so the state could MitM them)
[00:38:12] <ggreer> I never experienced it, but I heard of random drug tests. they'll take your hair so they can see if you ever consumed any illegal drug (even if it was while you were overseas)
[00:38:25] <ggreer> and prosecute you if you did
[00:39:51] <adiabatic> …but you can see how that might be a step up from, say, Chesa Boudin's SF governance
[00:40:25] <mst> oen gets the feeling that the PRC seems great so long as the leopard doesn't eat -your- face
[00:42:11] <adiabatic> mst: "leopard that probably won't eat your face" sounds pretty good compared to either "leopard eating your face" or "leopard setting up a dinner table where your face is on the menu"
[00:42:46] <ggreer> yeah it's great until you say one thing that contradicts the PRC. then you're suddenly disappeared
[00:43:08] <ggreer> doesn't matter if you're the richest man in china. step out of line and you're done

[00:44:40] <dbohdan> mst: "Full Eggdrop"?
[00:44:42] <adiabatic> I hear the "doesn't contradict the PRC list" doesn't change much, and it's mostly regarding PRC governance. If you think you're probably not going to trip over that, then their censorship rules sound way more tolerable

[01:08:22] <dbohdan> Sounds good
[01:08:34] <shawwwn> it was python + redis, and he mentioned that he was surprised it was able to do the job vs something that's supposedly more "sophisticated" (his scare quotes, not mine)
[01:08:40] <shawwwn> and we bonded a bit over how complexity was the enemy
[01:09:11] <shawwwn> I got the sense that they already want me, so all I had to do was seem generic and relatable and not tell him how horrible his mom was at sucking my cock last night
[01:09:14] <shawwwn> stuff like that
[01:09:23] <dbohdan> Even better
[01:09:46] <shawwwn> so, it's a relief to be able to forget about everything related to routable and do JAX things from now until sunday night :)
[01:09:54] <shawwwn> I'm gonna try making a sharding partition visualizer
[01:10:20] <shawwwn> it's a neat challenge, because normally you don't get any info at all
[01:10:53] <shawwwn> in other words, right now, TPUs come with 8 cores out of the box. JAX makes it easier to use all 8 cores than anything else I've seen
[01:10:54] <dbohdan> I hope you get the job!  (G'night.)
[01:11:04] <two2thehead> sharding being crypto-related?
[01:11:09] <shawwwn> thank you <3 you're awesome. I appreciate your cheerfulness too
[01:11:13] <shawwwn> g'night.
[01:11:33] <shawwwn> nah, not yet. though I imagine the crypto people will discover TPUs soon enough
[01:11:38] <shawwwn> the shards are basically
[01:11:40] <shawwwn> picture a box
[01:11:43] <shawwwn> break it up into 4 pieces
[01:11:52] <shawwwn> now picture another box, broken up in that same way
[01:11:59] <shawwwn> like a rubick's cube, say.
[01:12:30] <shawwwn> the challenge is, each piece needs to interact with every other piece, because each piece contains a lot of numbers
[01:12:45] <shawwwn> and to get the final result (a matrix multiply), it needs to touch all the numbers eventually
[01:13:05] <shawwwn> but the catch is, you can do a lot to influence how many pieces interact with how many other pieces
[01:13:21] <shawwwn> it's easy to have a naive solution that just touches every piece to get the result

[01:13:29] *** Joins: Baughn (sid153359@tinside.irccloud.com)
[01:13:29] <shawwwn> but e.g. if the box is like 
[01:13:33] <shawwwn> | a | b |
[01:13:36] <shawwwn> | c | d |
[01:13:50] <shawwwn> and you're multiplying two of those together
[01:14:01] <shawwwn> then as long as "a" only touches "a", it's fast
[01:14:27] <shawwwn> for example, a component wise sum -- gradeschool addition -- is fast, because each number in "a" doesn't need any information from b, c, or d in order to get the final answer
[01:14:50] <shawwwn> so a, b, c, and d are their own separate cores (I like to think of them as separate computers to really make the slowdown boundaries clear)
[01:15:16] <shawwwn> and you have control over how a, b, c, and d look, because you control the partitions. An example is, you could rearrange it so that the box is broken up horizontally, like this
[01:15:23] <shawwwn> [ a | b | c | d ]
[01:15:30] <shawwwn> so it's still a square, but it's a bunch of skinny vertical pieces
[01:15:38] <shawwwn> you can do it longways too
[01:15:40] <shawwwn> a
[01:15:41] <shawwwn> -
[01:15:42] <shawwwn> b
[01:15:44] <shawwwn> -
[01:15:45] <shawwwn> etc
[01:16:39] <two2thehead> hmm
[01:16:41] <shawwwn> each of these boxes I've been talking about are model parameters. That means that you can choose this sharding layout differently for every aspect of your model -- GPT has something like 135 model param "boxes" (groups) that you can choose sharding patterns for, theoretically
[01:16:47] * two2thehead saves that in onenote
[01:17:27] <two2thehead> irc lesswrong shawwwn shards
[01:17:38] <shawwwn> so the maximum performance is achieved by figuring out how to lay out each of the boxes so that "a" always has as much information as possible, without bothering b, c, d, for every model param
[01:18:12] <shawwwn> which means it's a matter of tracing through the computation graph, and making it visible -- I want a visualizer to show me "this sharding choice here resulted in extra traffic over there, because "a" had to bug "d")
[01:18:51] <kuudes> sort of similar to column db?
[01:19:19] <kuudes> and you want EXPLAIN for it?
[01:20:23] <shawwwn> bingo! I despise sql, but conceptually yes, there's no EXPLAIN. Whatever EXPLAIN does.
[01:20:32] <shawwwn> if it gives information, it's better than what currently exists. :)

[05:02:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> But. One thing so few people seem to mention is ...
[05:03:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> In the Soviet Union, censorship wasn't *just* "stopping certain topics from being mentioned". It was also quality control
[05:04:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like... ok, so you know how American films about the military, especially older ones, routinely have wild misrepresentations of basic shit, to the point where their portrayal of any military or war related topics whatsoever was just fantasy?
[05:04:48] <nshepperd> RiversHaveWings: pretty!
[05:04:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well... Soviet movies weren't like that.
[05:05:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like I was just watching an old (black and white) movie about the Revolution and the credits are like
[05:05:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Military consultant: Marshal Konev.
[05:07:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can bet that, whatever ideological skew the film may have in terms of how the events were portrayed, they did not get basic shit wrong
[05:07:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> The government imposed that
[05:07:42] <gwern> so what's the hypothesis there? the professional military insisted on it, while american military is like GENERAL X: "Y is unrealistic, it's really Z" HOLLYWOOD DIRECTOR: "yeah, but Y is fucking cool, so shut up, I'm the auteur here"

[05:28:07] <galambo> I dont think moldbug explicitly says that what happened in egypt was a positive outcome, but I think he is implying it

[05:32:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Amusing to read shit like this:
[05:32:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I have been utterly perplexed to discover that some California schools have banned venerable classics such as Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men and Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, because of concerns about their use of racial slurs and stereotypes. Of course, we don’t want children to read racist literature. But believing that these particular works propagate racial
[05:32:55] <Obormot\Arcturus>  hatred requires the same mental contortions that Soviet censors exercised when they laboured so hard to imagine all the ways a work of art might lead citizens astray."
[05:33:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> > Of course, we don’t want children to read racist literature.
[05:33:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course!
[05:33:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> But then, aren't we just, as they say, haggling over the price?
[05:35:02] <saturn2> should there be an equal time rule for racism vs anti-racism?
[05:35:26] <galambo> isnt anti-racism racism?
[05:35:38] <Betawolf> the curriculums seem to just blend the two together seamlessly
[05:35:49] <mst> galambo: depends what definition one uses
[05:36:23] <rmmh> "The other feature scans all iMessage images sent or received by child accounts—that is, accounts designated as owned by a minor—for sexually explicit material, and if the child is young enough, notifies the parent when these images are sent or received." 
[05:36:27] <mst> galambo: much stuff called 'Anti-Racism' is at best retardulous
[05:36:45] <mst> galambo: just like I've often said "I'm against Social Justice because I'm for social justice"
[05:37:01] <rmmh> thank you for thinking of the children Tim apple 
[05:37:22] <galambo> mst, how about if out of the blue I say we should not differentiate between ashkenazi jews and non-ashkenazi jews. they are all jews and we should treat them equally.
[05:37:56] <galambo> I think ssc already discussed this
[05:38:10] <Betawolf> jew ranking?
[05:38:15] <mst> galambo: what
[05:38:27] <mst> how is this relevant to anything i just said

[05:40:19] <nshepperd2> 'white fragility' style anti-racism is just rebranded white nationalism, yes (ironically)
[05:41:02] <PlanckWalk> I have no idea what "'white fragility' style anti-racism" is
[05:41:14] <PlanckWalk> Is it something I want to read about?
[05:41:22] <nshepperd2> best not to know
[05:42:36] <Betawolf> it's unsatirisable
[05:45:47] <galambo> it just came to me that what happened in egypt post arab spring is exactly what moldbug has been preaching for
[05:49:03] <quanticle> Yes, and it's exactly why I think Moldbug is just as much of a utopianist as the Marxists he opposes
[05:49:35] <gwern> if it happens in some real world place, it's not utopian by definition
[05:49:48] <quanticle> No, my take is that it *didn't* happen
[05:50:04] <quanticle> If it had happened, we'd all be talking about the "Egyptian economic miracle" by now
[05:50:22] <quanticle> Meanwhile, in real Egypt...
[05:50:31] <gwern> are they worse off than they were under the brotherhood?
[05:51:07] <galambo> so if the military coup did not happen in 2013, it could have been much better or much worse
[05:51:09] <quanticle> I don't know about *worse*, but certainly not better. Corruption is, if anything, worse. And now you have enhanced political repression on top of the corruption.
[05:51:50] *** Quits: ua_ (~ua@public-gprs230798.centertel.pl) (Excess Flood)
[05:52:09] <galambo> the much better scenario would have been democratic elections in the next election cycle. the muslim brotherhood had become unpopular at the time so there would have been a decent chance for a secular person to get elected
[05:52:25] <quanticle> It turns out that most dictators are stupid and corrupt, and there aren't enough exceptions (like Lee Kyuan Yew, Sultan Quabus, and Park Chung Hee) to reform the world.
[05:52:51] <galambo> the much worse scenario would have been the muslim brotherhood consolidating power and causing all sorts of chaos
[05:52:57] *** Joins: ua_ (~ua@public-gprs230798.centertel.pl)
[05:53:14] <quanticle> I mean, you'd have gone from a secular dictatorship to an Islamic dictatorship, like Iran
[05:53:31] <galambo> quanticle, yes thats the much worse scenario
[05:54:06] <quanticle> Not actually all that sure that Khomeini was that much worse than the Shah
[05:54:22] <quanticle> The Shah was a pretty vicious and brutal dictator in his own right
[05:54:44] <galambo> quanticle, I would rather the ruler be evil than be evil and stupid
[05:54:54] <galambo> islam is stupid
[05:55:07] <quanticle> Okay, that's fair
[05:55:42] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[05:55:44] <saturn2> moldbug appears to be praising popular sovereignty, which he would never do, so i assume he must have been being ironic
[05:56:08] *** Quits: ua_ (~ua@public-gprs230798.centertel.pl) (Excess Flood)
[05:56:15] <galambo> anyways I realised at the time that egypt was fucked either way, so I planned to leave. this is probably the best approach.
[05:56:41] <galambo> I mean I witnessed and was involved in some crazy political changes
[05:57:12] <galambo> and what do I have to show for it?
[05:57:14] *** Joins: ua_ (~ua@public-gprs230798.centertel.pl)
[05:57:42] <galambo> the best approach imo is to treat the country you are in as a package. if you like the package, stay. if you find a better package somewhere else, leave.
[05:57:55] <galambo> maybe we should all go to singapore

[05:58:19] <nshepperd> still being alive is pretty good
[05:59:20] <galambo> you are unlikely to change the politics in your country. the best you can do is laugh at other people's stupidity
[05:59:51] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[06:01:33] <quanticle> Yeah, but packages do change over time. Sometimes for the better (Singapore, Korea). Sometimes for the worse (Iran, Iraq).
[06:02:50] <galambo> galambo, thats exactly why you need a second passport and the ability to pack all your possessions into a briefcase
[06:02:57] <galambo> quanticle*
[06:05:44] <quanticle> Maybe
[06:06:08] <galambo> so yes moldbug is very good at pointing out the deficiencies of the current regime, but his solution was already tried once on yours truly's country and it didnt work. not that this matters because moldbug's solution is unlikely to happen in your country. so its all hopeless.

[06:13:34] <gwern> '5. The annual increase in college tuition and fees of only 0.78% in 2020 was the smallest annual increase in the history of the CPI for college tuition and fees going back to 1978, and the only annual increase ever below 1%. In each of the last six months this year the annual increases in college tuition have been less than 0.50%, which like the declines in college textbook prices is...
[06:13:40] <gwern> ...unprecedented and remarkable. The recent unprecedented small increases in college tuition are way far below the average annual increase in college tuition of nearly 7% over the last 42 years. So perhaps the “higher education bubble” is finally starting to show signs of deflating? And we can expect that bubble to continue to deflate as a result of the new pressure from the coronavirus...
[06:13:46] <gwern> ...pandemic on higher education that has accelerated the downward trend in college enrollment that has been ongoing for the last decade.'
[06:17:13] <quanticle> Also, China is putting in new restrictions on students going abroad for education
[06:17:24] <quanticle> So that's a lot of revenue going away
[06:19:01] <galambo> quanticle, also didnt china decide to make education non-profit?
[06:20:19] <quanticle> No? They decided to make tutoring non-profit
[06:20:41] <quanticle> I don't know what their stance is on for-profit universities
[06:20:58] <quanticle> But their gaokao test prep has to be nonprofit (mostly, with some exceptions)
[06:21:01] <galambo> ah yes
[06:22:25] <galambo> I had a conversation with my brother and he told me he hates japanese culture
[06:22:38] <galambo> he thinks anime is stupid
[06:22:45] <galambo> nintendo ruined the video game industry
[06:23:05] <galambo> japanese people are too nationalist
[06:23:12] <rmmh> does he reject the nintendo-saved-video-games thesis
[06:23:13] <quanticle> But what does that have to do with *Chinese* education policy?
[06:23:19] <galambo> and have ugly morals
[06:23:23] <galambo> and disgusting food
[06:23:36] <rmmh> does he enjoy WWII anti-japanese propaganda
[06:23:46] <quanticle> Okay, but... why does he care?
[06:24:18] <rmmh> it's a pretty obscure racism, you're supposed to hate the minorities that live near you
[06:24:25] <quanticle> Yeah, exactly
[06:24:39] <galambo> quanticle, I think he is upset that everyone holds japanese culture in high regard
[06:24:43] <galambo> I mean he own a lexus
[06:24:46] <quanticle> Like, has your brother even *seen* a Japanese person in real life?

[06:24:53] <quanticle> Lol
[06:24:56] <rmmh> ah, so just generic jingoism
[06:25:32] <galambo> I mean I dont know many japanese people. I once had a japanese housemate for 6 months and they were nice
[06:25:44] <galambo> but I dont come across them often
[06:25:59] <galambo> I myself like japanese culture
[06:26:24] <quanticle> Yeah, I mean... it's just weird to hold these vehement opinions on like... anime.
[06:26:47] <rmmh> you should convince him to just hate weebs
[06:26:51] <quanticle> You don't like it, don't watch it. It's not as if Japanese food is at any risk of displacing the UK's native cuisine
[06:26:54] <quanticle> Indian food already did that
[06:27:14] <galambo> quanticle, haha
[06:27:32] <rmmh> britain had no natural defenses against food with flavor
[06:27:49] <mst> I mean, immigrants invented chicken tikka masala to provide a curry they could actualls sell to us without breaking, so yes, agree on that basis
[06:27:57] <mst> though also proper fish and chips is a glorious thing
[06:28:34] <rmmh> does the uk have fish and chips places operated by non-immigrants
[06:28:48] <galambo> mst, you say this but I get genuinely nauseous after eating the fish in the 'fish and chips'.
[06:28:58] <galambo> (Im now vegan so it doesnt matter)
[06:29:24] <rmmh> that's a common vegan failing; not having enough gall
[06:30:05] <mst> galambo: then it's bad fish and chips
[06:30:16] <mst> galambo: bad X is everywhere for every cuisine X
[06:31:29] <mst> galambo: though also even the good stuff is basically soaked in grease, so if that doesn't work for you, please do feel free to refuse to ever eat it
[06:33:52] <galambo> mst, I apologise
[06:34:40] <galambo> mst, I do enjoy british food. I even enjoy british microwave meals. and british hospital food. which are probably the worst examples of british food.

[06:59:30] <rmmh> twitter is mad because a "Y: The Last Man" trailer dropped and the virus that kills all the men actually kills everyone with a Y chromosome, so it kills MTF people too
[07:00:55] <gwern> ...really?
[07:01:26] <gwern> wait, did the trailer make a point of killing some trans or are they just extrapolating from 'kills everyone with a y chromosome'
[07:01:37] <nshepperd> do they actually say that in the trailer? seems a bit niche
[07:15:19] <nshepperd2> conversely i guess it wouldn't kill XX men with a stray SRY gene. lucky for them
[07:15:21] <saturn2> i guess it's misgendering to call him the last man when there are still a bunch of transmen

[08:26:31] <PapuaHardyNet> evening, everybody
[08:27:00] <rmmh> galambo: are you asking how to buy that literal item, or what?
[08:27:23] <galambo> rmmh, no I can easily buy it on aliexpress
[08:27:30] <galambo> rmmh, Im asking for similar items
[08:27:40] <galambo> tourbillons are usually very expensive
[08:27:42] <gwern> galambo: so what happens when you buy it? do you finally attain true happiness?
[08:28:04] <galambo> gwern, Im still rocking my $10 f-84w
[08:28:21] <rmmh> I stopped wearing watches when I was 7 because I got pimples

[08:31:18] <quanticle> I don't know about tourbillons, but I did buy this knock-off of a Nomos Tangente: https://www.good-stuffs.com/Minimalist-automatic-wristwatch-specially-tailored-to-add-your-image-or-brand-_p_236.html

[08:31:48] <quanticle> It involved sending a Paypal transfer to some random dude in China
[08:31:53] <quanticle> Not even a business account
[08:31:56] <quanticle> Just a dude
[08:32:22] <quanticle> The watch took like 6 weeks to arrive. 4 weeks in, I was 90% certain I'd been scammed
[08:32:26] <galambo> quanticle, I was actually considering buying this watch before. how is it?
[08:32:45] <quanticle> It's all right. It's a basic watch. It keeps okay time. It looks nice
[08:33:09] <quanticle> Okay time meaning like +15s/week
[08:34:37] <rmmh> I like the grand seiko mechanism
[08:34:53] <rmmh> basically a mechanical watch, but with a quartz regulator to make it actually keep time properly
[08:36:22] <galambo> I mean if I want an accurate and practical watch then a cheap casio watch is best
[08:36:33] <galambo> I think if I buy anything more expensive it will be for signalling
[08:36:39] <galambo> its like buying a car
[08:36:44] <galambo> either buy a cheap clunker
[08:36:47] <galambo> or a sports car
[08:36:55] <galambo> no point buying anything in between
[08:37:02] <PapuaHardyNet> barbell strategy, yes. I follow a similar strategy for all my purchases
[08:37:22] <quanticle> I think the thing with buying stuff like that is that it's like gambling. You have to be okay with "losing your money". So if the watch arrived totally broken or something, you have to be ready for that.
[08:37:23] <rmmh> that's weird. I try to optimize price/performance
[08:37:37] <rmmh> that doesn't apply to watches, but does to cars
[08:38:03] <quanticle> And I was. I figured if the watch was utterly terrible or broken or if it never arrived, at least I'd have a good story
[08:38:13] <galambo> quanticle, exactly. I kind of like this watch because a tourbillon is balling. and the watch is not very expensive. so its like a cheap sportscar. best of all worlds.
[08:38:44] <galambo> rmmh, but why optimize for price/performance? why not price/practicality?
[08:38:52] <galambo> are you drag racing with your car?
[08:39:10] <galambo> if I want to drive fast I might go go karting or something
[08:39:14] <rmmh> performance is a vague gesture at whatever your item-utilons are
[08:39:51] <rmmh> so probably comfort, reliability, style
[08:40:12] <quanticle> I think the other big risk there is that if your watch breaks, then basically no reputable jeweler is going to fix it. One of my friends in Seattle had another Chinese knock-off watch, and it developed a problem. So he took it into a jewelry store to see if it could be fixed. The person there took one look at it and handed the watch back saying they weren't going to deal with it.
[08:40:47] <quanticle> Not as much of a concern with the $100 Nomos knockoff
[08:40:49] <rmmh> are you going to pay $100 to fix your $100 watch?
[08:40:56] <quanticle> More of a concern with the $500 tourbillon
[08:41:23] <galambo> quanticle, true
[08:42:35] <galambo> can you guys think of similar items? I can think of knock off Chinese fountain pens

[08:46:44] <quanticle> The "official" one from Lenovo was expensive
[08:47:22] <saturn2> i've gotten several replacement thinkpad parts from aliexpress at a ~98% discount

[09:48:42] <quanticle> galambo_: It's not surprising that they do. They were very early into Bitcoin and most of the really early Bitcoin investors were Von Mises types who were freaked out that the US was about to enter hyperinflation.

[11:17:00] <adiabatic> I thought the new rpm was weird for returning, like, 22 if all packages were up to date or whatever

[11:20:54] <adiabatic> (I'd give you the same recommendations anyway, but…)
[11:20:57] <PapuaHardyNet> do you know what a pain it is to compile numpy to run on alpine?

[11:21:14] <dbohdan> quanticle: Note also that the D bot is not written in the version of D everyone uses today, and the Tcl bot doesn't use Eggdrop
[11:21:24] <adiabatic> that's a real enough reason
[11:22:05] <adiabatic> in that case, you may want something super mega boring like Debian stable because emacs is a fossil unless it uses new whizzy sub-programs that might only be in sid or fedora
[11:22:20] <adiabatic> and if you're in emacs enough, do you really care about your window manager

[11:22:26] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: Wait, how is it that difficult? I can understand how it'd be time consuming because you have to compile not just numpy, but all of numerical methods libraries that numpy relies on, but does Alpine install libraries into weird locations or something?
[11:22:38] <saturn2> debian is the universal operating system

[11:22:44] <quanticle> lmao

[11:23:17] <dbohdan> adiabatic: I've been using more and more Deno.  It's nice enough, certainly nicer than the other general-purpose JavaScript runtime.  Their idea to port the Go standard library to a language with a better type system (TypeScript) appeals to me.
[11:23:50] <quanticle> Yeah, I think I'll install something ultra-boring like Fedora or Debian. 
[11:23:51] <PapuaHardyNet> typescript has a better type system than golang?

[11:40:26] <rsaarelm> You don't have strong type libraries because those start coming to their own in bigger monolithic program.s

[11:48:45] <PapuaHardyNet> my father just got scammed - they sold him "optical fible" ISP connection, and the endpoint uses ethernet via PPPoE
[11:49:17] <PapuaHardyNet> obviously, the bottleneck is the ethernet, so paying for "optical fibre" is meaningless
[11:49:50] <nshepperd2> uh, ethernet is crazy fast
[11:50:49] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. okay, I'm sure my dad's connection isn't bottlenecked by ethernet then.
[11:50:56] <nshepperd2> the point of optical fiber is that it can be fast over long distances
[11:51:00] <PapuaHardyNet> but theoretically, ethernet is the bottleneck, right?
[11:52:01] <nshepperd2> the usual standard for ethernet these days is gigabit/s

[11:52:42] <rmmh> ? pppoe is very common with fiber
[11:52:47] <feep[work]> well, the point of fiber is that you can push more customers over it, right?

[11:53:19] <feep[work]> more data to the same amount of customers*
[11:54:09] <feep[work]> local ethernet is p much never the limit, simply because ... like, an isp wouldn't be offering X internet if there weren't consumer products widely available that could digest X

[11:55:52] <feep[work]> excluding wlan, I guess?
[11:56:26] <saturn2> plenty of people pay extra for connections that are faster than their wifi
[11:56:28] <feep[work]> I don't think people usually shell out for ftth and then put it on wlan tho
[11:56:33] <feep[work]> that'd be sad.
[11:56:50] <saturn2> that's just good marketing
[11:56:55] <feep[work]> still sad!
[11:56:58] <feep[work]> also looks bad on speedtest.net
[11:57:38] <nshepperd2> thank them for subsidising high speed internet for those of us who know how to set up local ethernet i guess
[11:59:55] <quanticle> Yeah, like... unless your dad is getting a 10G OC-192, the local Gigabit ethernet is not the bottleneck
[12:00:04] <quanticle> Heck, even wifi is like 800 Mbit
[12:00:11] <quanticle> If you have 802.11ac
[12:00:29] <feep[work]> I think I turned that off cause it didn't work right with rpi
[12:00:48] <nshepperd2> i don't think i've ever seen wifi hit the advertised speeds
[12:00:51] <rmmh> 802.11ax is great
[12:00:58] <nshepperd2> there's just too much bullshit in the stack
[12:01:00] <quanticle> I have, but then again, I live in a house
[12:01:07] <quanticle> And the spectrum here is *clean*
[12:01:18] <feep[work]> <quanticle> I have, but then again, I live in a society
[12:01:25] <quanticle> lol
[12:01:32] <feep[work]> <quanticle> bottom noise
[12:02:01] <quanticle> I mean, I live in the United States of America, so according to you Europeans I'm like... two steps removed from Mad Max dystopia at all times
[12:02:34] <rmmh> we also don't have brutalist concrete and stone construction to destroy our wifi
[12:02:53] <quanticle> Yeah, we're not living in literal castles
[12:04:42] *** Quits: oxide (~lambda@user/oxide) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[12:07:05] <galambo_> I think I have arrived at an investing insight
[12:07:22] <galambo_> leverage is better than stock picking
[12:07:35] <saturn2> lol
[12:07:43] <PapuaHardyNet> do you have a 10,000 essay to explain it, that would help
[12:08:18] <galambo_> ?
[12:08:25] <PapuaHardyNet> s/essay/word essay/
[12:08:33] <PapuaHardyNet> forgive me, I'm a bit distracted
[12:08:49] <saturn2> 10,000 one-word essays would be ever better
[12:09:18] <PapuaHardyNet> [print("LEVERAGE") for i in range(10000)]
[12:09:21] <galambo_> PapuaHardyNet, probably the best approach is 50% leveraged stocks and 50% bonds
[12:09:21] <PapuaHardyNet> there you go
[12:09:31] <dbohdan2> "gwern would appreciate broccoli going extinct."  This is the most American thing I've ever read
[12:09:36] <galambo_> because they are uncorrelated
[12:09:50] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm 100% into crypto, maybe I should use leverage
[12:09:52] <galambo_> leveraging an index fund that is
[12:09:59] <galambo_> because index funds are diversified
[12:10:16] <galambo_> PapuaHardyNet, you can leverage ethereum and bitcoin
[12:10:38] <galambo_> its too risky though
[12:11:42] <PapuaHardyNet> there are "leverage" based asset allocations one can do using stablecoins but I forget what that entails
[12:11:54] <PapuaHardyNet> something about borrowing against the stablecoin etc etc
[12:12:15] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, my current plan is to experiment with stablecoin staking instead of just HODLing
[12:13:46] <adiabatic> what's stablecoin staking and how is that different from buying cash and stuffing it under your mattress
[12:13:48] <dbohdan2> adiabatic: I agree, IME being written in Go *is* predictive of quality for command line utilities.  (Although, how much of it is "not being written in JavaScript for Node.js"?)
[12:14:10] <galambo_> PapuaHardyNet, https://www.tokensets.com/portfolio/ethfli. but you wont be able to stake ethereum if you leverage it
[12:14:10] <Robomot> TokenSets - Asset Management Simplified (Use Set’s battle-tested asset management tools and infrastructure to easily manage your crypto portfolios.)
[12:14:53] <adiabatic> dbohdan2: what bothers me about Node-dependent apps is the dependence on a runtime. Granted, it's a runtime I have anyway, but I'd rather have apps that are bundled up in a bow and don't have runtime dependencies like, say, Prettier
[12:15:43] <adiabatic> PapuaHardyNet: is there a cute name for the australian dollar like canadians have 'loonies'
[12:16:08] <saturn2> PapuaHardyNet: please don't listen to galambo's advice
[12:16:27] <adiabatic> if I want to talk about usd and cad I can talk about greenbacks and loonies, but if I'm talking about oz money, AFAIK I'm stuck
[12:17:21] <PapuaHardyNet> adiabatic: staking stablecoin is basically putting it into a bank with no legal recourse, which guarantees you an ROI in that stablecoin
[12:17:45] <PapuaHardyNet> the guarantee isn't legal, obviously. It is usually based on code.
[12:18:04] <saturn2> adiabatic: dollarinos
[12:18:10] <dbohdan2> adiabatic: Yeah.  I hope https://deno.land/manual/tools/compiler succeeds.
[12:18:17] <Robomot> Deno (Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust.)
[12:18:40] <adiabatic> deno is great on windows, too. literally just one binary
[12:18:42] <dbohdan2> (To the point where standalone tools written in JS are pressured to use it.)
[12:19:10] <adiabatic> saturn2: "dollarinos" sounds like 4chan imagining soyjacks' saying it
[12:19:26] <adiabatic> reddit soyjacks*
[12:19:33] <PapuaHardyNet> adiabatic: accurate, that is exactly what came to my mind after reading it
[12:19:37] <saturn2> australians do talk like soyjak
[12:20:53] <saturn2> if it's not adding -ino it's the first syllable + ie
[12:20:57] <saturn2> so dollies
[12:21:05] <PapuaHardyNet> that's worse
[12:21:45] <adiabatic> I have an oz bloke voice for siri and he doesn't sound like the hipsters who served me excellent beer today
[12:22:29] <saturn2> yeah, siri doesn't use the slang
[12:22:29] <quanticle> galambo_: Isn't leverage the thing that causes you to blow up when the market turns against you unexpectedly? The thing that everyone shakes their head about when they hear of a hedge fund or investment bank going under? "30-to-1 leverage. What *were* they thinking?"
[12:23:14] <quanticle> >I'm 100% into crypto, maybe I should use leverage
[12:23:20] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: Please, please do
[12:23:25] <quanticle> I could use some lolz
[12:23:40] <galambo_> quanticle, I dont know where to begin
[12:23:42] <PapuaHardyNet> if I am smart enough to figure out how to do so, then I will for sure
[12:23:43] <quanticle> Post about it on WallStreetBets
[12:23:46] <adiabatic> "leverage" is "borrowing money to make wall-street bets", right?
[12:23:49] <galambo_> there are two criticisms against leverage
[12:24:34] <saturn2> "One Dollar – $1 – Brown Bomber, Rooboy, Queenie + Bung buck (highly insulting term referring to the indigenous people depicted thereon.)" hmm
[12:25:02] <adiabatic> but how many of these names are as real as dropbears tho
[12:25:10] <adiabatic> s/real/fake/
[12:25:27] <saturn2> there's no problem caused by leverage that you can't cure with even more leverage
[12:25:31] <galambo_> the first criticism is that leveraging gets reset daily. this is not really a valid criticism because it works for you in the upside just like it works against you in the downside
[12:25:58] <saturn2> just gotta make sure you're too big to fail
[12:26:02] <galambo_> the second criticism is that if you leverage 30x you are guaranteed to lose your money. that is obviously correct
[12:26:13] <galambo_> 30x leverage is stupid
[12:26:15] <dbohdan2> adiabatic: So far I've written tests for software in other languages in the POSIX shell, Tcl, and Python.  I expect to use more Deno for it.  https://github.com/dbohdan/caddy-markdown-site/blob/e6a36715cacd85964cdb367a88783af17aed49e6/test.ts was an easy port from Tcl and more compact and statically typed in the end.  The only thing I don't like about this rewrite is the abundance of async/await.

[12:26:17] <dbohdan2> Lightweight threads with sync-looking code are a nicer model for concurrency.
[12:26:17] <quanticle> saturn2: The ultimate source of leverage: The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States
[12:26:39] <galambo_> I recommend you guys read lifecycle investing
[12:26:51] <galambo_> lifecycle investing argues that diversification is very important
[12:27:00] <quanticle> It's incorrect that leverage gets reset daily, unless you're closing out all your options at the end of the day.
[12:27:14] <galambo_> quanticle, yes in an etf this is what happens
[12:27:39] <quanticle> Yeah, but as an individual investor trading options (as opposed to a trader for an institution) you're under no such obligation.
[12:28:10] <galambo_> quanticle, well etfs are easier to manage and dont need to be constantly monitored
[12:28:33] <galambo_> in any case lifecycle investing argues that diversificiation is the only free lunch in investing
[12:28:39] <galambo_> so index funds are better than stock picking
[12:28:53] <galambo_> but just like we are diversifying assets
[12:29:00] <galambo_> we should also diversify over time
[12:29:26] <adiabatic> isn't the best way to diversify over time to HODL?
[12:29:53] <feep[work]> a1jx52 all the things
[12:29:54] <galambo_> the traditional boglehead approach is to invest in index funds when young and then gradually increase the allocation in bonds as we grow older
[12:30:15] <feep[work]> right, maximum market to start, then shift into stable
[12:30:59] <galambo_> lifecycle investing argues that this approach is imabalanced. because the amount of money you invest in your 20s and 30s is much lower than the amount of money you will invest when you approach retirement
[12:31:24] <galambo_> especially if you also account for pension
[12:31:34] <feep[work]> that doesn't apply to fire tho, right?
[12:31:54] <feep[work]> which I think assumes a *fairly* flat or at least bounded income, that is in exchange very big
[12:32:15] <quanticle> Except, diversification isn't *really* a free lunch. A diversified portfolio will necessarily include some assets that are underperforming in any given set of market conditions in order to hedge against market conditions shifting and those assets becoming overperformers. A diversified portfolio trades upside potential for downside risk mitigation.
[12:32:36] <feep[work]> quanticle: that should balance out though
[12:32:37] <quanticle> That's why a lot of people pay lip service to diversification... and then go all in on a certain asset class.
[12:32:40] <galambo_> quanticle, not if the assets have decent long term returns
[12:32:49] <galambo_> and are uncorrelated
[12:32:57] <feep[work]> quanticle: if you can extract money by going all in, that means you just go all in until the free money is gone
[12:33:04] <quanticle> "I'm diversified, I'm invested in Bitcoin *and* Ethereum"
[12:33:27] <galambo_> anyways lifecycle investing says that the best approach is to invest in 2x leveraged s&p 500 when young
[12:33:31] <feep[work]> we should expect fully diversified stock returns to maximize linear value
[12:33:33] <quanticle> feep[work]: Yeah, but that assumes you can time the market and get out when the free money is gone, and not after.
[12:33:44] <feep[work]> quanticle: after isn't a problem
[12:33:44] <galambo_> to increase exposure to the stock market when young
[12:33:52] <PapuaHardyNet> quanticle: diversification is done to cancel out asset specific risks
[12:33:55] <feep[work]> quanticle: cause your asset just goes back to net zero ev
[12:33:57] <galambo_> then reduce the allocation aggressively when you grow older
[12:34:02] <feep[work]> quanticle: all you lose is time
[12:34:06] <PapuaHardyNet> that is the entire point, reduce the risk taken for a given expected return
[12:34:23] <feep[work]> so like, you have to time it a bit, but you don't get crippled if you don't
[12:34:31] <PapuaHardyNet> if you aren't getting free reduction of asset specific risks due to diversification it is a waste of your money to diversify
[12:34:34] <quanticle> Yeah, 2x leveraged S&P 500 when young doesn't sound all that bad.
[12:34:37] <feep[work]> in any case, the point is, you should still expect the market to already be efficiently timed
[12:34:39] <galambo_> a diversified portfolio has less volatility and better returns
[12:34:46] <feep[work]> quanticle: it sounds strictly worse than unleveraged s&p
[12:35:21] <galambo_> and then theres a guy called hedgefundie who makes another proposal.
[12:35:23] <quanticle> Isn't it only worse if you expect the long term rate of return of the S&P to be 0?
[12:35:39] <quanticle> Like, if you have enough capital to ride out the shocks... why not?
[12:35:39] <feep[work]> quanticle: it's strictly worse cause it has overhead
[12:35:47] <galambo_> he proposes 55% 3x leveraged s&p 500 and 45% 3x leveraged 10 year bonds
[12:36:01] <feep[work]> the point is if leverage is free money, it should already be priced in the market anyway
[12:36:04] <galambo_> stocks and bonds both have decent returns and are uncorrelated
[12:36:05] <feep[work]> via fintech
[12:36:16] <adiabatic> …borrow 3x as much money as you have put into bonds to buy…more bonds?
[12:36:39] <feep[work]> so all you get is organizational overhead loss
[12:36:42] <quanticle> feep[work]: Yeah, well, *should* and *is* are two entirely different things. In theory the market is efficient, in practice it's not.
[12:36:42] <galambo_> the thinking is if the stock market crashes people will flock into bonds
[12:36:52] <feep[work]> quanticle: sorry, not efficient, but at least inexploitable
[12:37:03] <feep[work]> inexploitable without comparative advantage
[12:37:06] <galambo_> HOWEVER, this approach has a big problem. it is vulnerable to inflation
[12:37:11] <quanticle> I'm not even sure that it's inexploitable over the long run, assuming you have a capital cushion.
[12:37:23] <galambo_> because bonds suffer with inflation
[12:37:25] <quanticle> If the market were truly inexploitable, why would it ever generate a return?
[12:37:26] <feep[work]> quanticle: you really think capital cushion is a comparative advantage
[12:37:30] <feep[work]> in *today's* conditions? :o
[12:37:39] <feep[work]> money is super cheap rn.
[12:37:57] <feep[work]> quanticle: value is genuinely produced :p
[12:37:59] <galambo_> https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=272007
[12:38:00] <Robomot> HEDGEFUNDIE's excellent adventure [risk parity strategy using 3x leveraged ETFs] - Bogleheads.org
[12:38:11] <feep[work]> and you can't beat the market but you can throw away money
[12:38:14] <adiabatic> dbohdan2: neat
[12:38:26] <quanticle> feep[work]: Sure, but why isn't the market's rate of return the same as that of inflation? Why isn't the value siphoned off by other people?
[12:38:47] <feep[work]> quanticle: inflation is an externally controlled quantity
[12:39:01] <saturn2> the market being unexploitable means you get the same expected return no matter what you invest in
[12:39:09] <feep[work]> inflation corrected, the market makes genuine returns because the economy produces genuine value.
[12:39:42] <feep[work]> and you *do* have a comparative personal advantage; your job training :p
[12:39:48] <quanticle> Right, I was talking about the *stock* market specifically, which is what saturn2 is pointing at.
[12:39:49] <feep[work]> labor is finite, so it can be sold.
[12:40:03] <feep[work]> quanticle: right, same here.
[12:40:17] <feep[work]> to a first approximation, the stock market is the economy.
[12:40:23] <quanticle> Like, the fact that you get different rates of return with stocks and bonds means that the market, at some level, is exploitable.
[12:40:31] <galambo_> so the traditional advice is invest 100 minus your age in stocks and the rest in an index fund. this is correct in the sense of newtonian physics. if you want the relativity theory read lifecycle investing and hedgefundie's approach.
[12:40:56] <feep[work]> quanticle: right, and I think in the long run that should be being eaten.
[12:40:56] <galambo_> quanticle, not really. it is well known that 60/40 stocks and bonds has the best risk benefit ratio
[12:41:11] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:41:12] <galambo_> you are just leveraging it
[12:41:14] <feep[work]> but the run there with stocks vs bonds is very, very long, because lifecycle investing is p close to the market horizon anyway
[12:41:15] <quanticle> feep[work]: Well, depends on how you define the "long run" but it's been 60 years
[12:41:43] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[12:41:44] <feep[work]> I think we'll see more convergence in that as we get autonomous long-lived cooperations, or possibly short-lived ems
[12:41:50] <feep[work]> coorporations*
[12:41:59] <saturn2> good lord
[12:42:07] <quanticle> Well, in that long run... we're all dead :D
[12:42:09] <feep[work]> XD
[12:42:12] <galambo_> 60/40 stocks and bonds has the best sharpe ratio but nobody likes it because the returns are low. so what do you do? you leverage it!
[12:42:25] <feep[work]> well, I mean, yeah
[12:42:38] <feep[work]> the market can stay irrational long enough to make some nice returns for people
[12:42:39] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:42:46] <quanticle> Yep
[12:42:49] <feep[work]> and there isn't *much* pressure on stocks vs bonds
[12:43:08] <feep[work]> I think there'd be more if we had a bigger mixture of lifetimes in market participants
[12:43:09] <quanticle> The market can stay irrational long enough for me to make a bunch of STONKS memes
[12:43:09] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[12:43:11] <feep[work]> but we don't
[12:43:27] <galambo_> same with ethereum. ethereum has a better sharpe ratio than a random erc20 token. but the returns on ethereum tend to be lower than erc20 projects. so what do you do? you leverage ethereum!
[12:43:47] <feep[work]> I mean, I said I wouldn't expect that to work, and I said why
[12:43:53] <feep[work]> I'm not sure what else I can say.
[12:44:12] <quanticle> I'm going to go ahead and encourage galambo_, because leveraging Ethereum sounds like a recipe for guaranteed lolz
[12:44:18] <feep[work]> that is fair.
[12:44:26] <feep[work]> lolz ... is also a form of value creation.
[12:44:32] <feep[work]> egh. ugh.
[12:44:48] <galambo_> quanticle, Im talking about leveraging 1.5x or 2x
[12:45:16] <saturn2> 60/40 stonks and bongs
[12:46:23] <galambo_> ideally I would want to allocate it 2x leveraged ethereum and 2x leveraged uncorrelated asset
[12:46:33] <quanticle> On the other hand, fuck it, why not? You're young. You have money to burn. Do it. Worst case, you have a fun story to tell. Best case? Get dat lambo
[12:46:34] <galambo_> maybe staking usd
[12:46:57] <nshepperd2> as long as this doesn't end with him buying $ROPE i'm for it
[12:47:11] <quanticle> Friend of a friend made enough on leveraged GME to buy a Porsche 911 with straight cash.
[12:47:14] <galambo_> or maybe 33% 2x staked eth, 33% 2x staked bitcoin, 33% staked usd
[12:47:15] <saturn2> i can't tell if galambo is insane or memeing
[12:47:29] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[12:47:47] <quanticle> nshepperd2: Yeah, don't stake more than you can afford to lose, obvs
[12:48:35] <nshepperd2> unfortunately staking more than you can afford to lose is the point of leverage
[12:48:35] <feep[work]> you can just not leverage and get a Half Lambo
[12:49:03] <feep[work]> an Lmogii
[12:49:12] <galambo_> I was thinking about making my own shitcoin and calling it getalambo
[12:49:23] <PapuaHardyNet> you know what, I think galambo_ makes sense
[12:49:31] <saturn2> god damn it
[12:49:35] <PapuaHardyNet> about leveraging ethereum
[12:49:37] <nshepperd2> lmao
[12:49:45] <feep[work]> I have yet to hear an objection to the idea that if this was free money, it should flow back into the market via fintech corps
[12:50:23] <saturn2> feep[work]: what does that even mean
[12:50:24] <galambo_> PapuaHardyNet, I think it makes more sense than investing in an erc20 shitcoin. but its probably still worse than hodling ethereum or staking ethereum
[12:50:40] <galambo_> I dont know
[12:50:49] <feep[work]> saturn2: like, people should be exploiting it as hard as they can, and the return from that exploiting should become part of the stock price of the company those people run
[12:50:55] <feep[work]> and that way it should end up back in the index anyhow.
[12:51:41] <saturn2> people are overleveraged as fuck and it is indeed making stonk prices go up
[12:51:48] <galambo_> feep[work], have you been reding matt levine? the stock market has been stupid recently
[12:51:55] <feep[work]> I read matt levine religiously
[12:52:00] <feep[work]> but stupid is not the same as exploitable.
[12:52:13] <galambo_> matt levine is like I have no idea whats going on
[12:52:17] <feep[work]> it's great yeah
[12:52:26] <feep[work]> but like, just because matt has no idea doesn't mean that you have an opportunity
[12:52:33] <feep[work]> in fact I'd argue it rather means the opposite of that
[12:52:50] <saturn2> traditionally this would lead to a huge crash sooner or later, but he fed has indicated its willingness to just let the market float away into a completely detached fantasy land
[12:52:52] <galambo_> feep[work], technically I should stay out of the market because the PE ratios are insane
[12:53:09] <saturn2> so who knows
[12:53:39] <feep[work]> I wish to propose the Law of Galambo: the market can stay brokenly profitable longer than you can stand being envious
[12:53:50] <galambo_> bitcoin and eth did crash in march 2020
[12:53:57] <feep[work]> okay, maybe not then
[12:54:08] <galambo_> so I dont think they are a good hedge against a stock market crash
[12:54:17] <galambo_> anyways
[12:54:28] <feep[work]> saturn2: anyway, my point is, with this the ev of flat etf index is *still* higher than levering.
[12:55:03] <feep[work]> (unless, personal comparative advantage, yadda yadda)

[12:56:00] <galambo_> feep[work], lifecycle investing approach is historically better than flat s&p 500
[12:56:10] <feep[work]> right, that part makes sense to me
[12:56:44] <galambo_> hedgefundie's approach of 55% 3x s&p 500 and 45% 10-20 year 3x leveraged bonds is also historically better than flat s&p 500
[12:57:05] <feep[work]> lots of things are historically better than flat s&p.
[12:57:22] <feep[work]> like, for instance, literally half the market.
[12:57:32] <galambo_> feep[work], active investing is not better than s&p 500
[12:57:43] <feep[work]> right, but you just switched from one particular strategy to a whole class of strategies
[12:57:47] <galambo_> s&p 500 is a benchmark thats hard to beat
[12:57:56] <feep[work]> and I'm p sure the thing that active investing *used* to be better than s&p
[12:58:09] <feep[work]> and exactly this thing happened: it sucked all the money out, and got saddled with overhead costs.
[12:58:35] <feep[work]> if you look at particular active investing strategies, I'm p sure you can still find some that are historically better than s&p
[12:58:41] <feep[work]> again, you should expect half of them to be.
[12:59:16] <nshepperd2> financial theology
[12:59:19] <feep[work]> half of all random walks are net bigger than their average.
[12:59:43] <feep[work]> the point of that study is you can't pick a strategy that *keeps* being superior.
[12:59:51] <galambo_> feep[work], but there is rationale behind lifecycle investing: better diversification over time by exposing yourself to more equity when young and less when old
[13:00:00] <feep[work]> and I wouldn't expect hedgefundie's strategy to stay superior for the exact same version.
[13:00:08] <feep[work]> yes, and my theory suggests why lifecycle investing should work
[13:00:13] <feep[work]> it also says that leveraging should not.
[13:00:22] <galambo_> and with hedgefundie: 60/40 stocks has the best sharpe ratio but low returns. so why not just leverage it?
[13:00:23] <feep[work]> because it's not bound to the human lifetime horizon in the same way.
[13:00:31] <galambo_> thats fair enough
[13:00:47] <feep[work]> same reason*
[13:01:39] <galambo_> but lifecycle investing entails leveraging
[13:02:10] <feep[work]> I thought that was just transitioning to bonds as you get older to align your portfolio with your expected selling schedle
[13:02:13] <feep[work]> u*
[13:02:15] <galambo_> I also dont expect half active investors to do better than the s&p 500. mainly because kelly criterion
[13:02:26] <galambo_> if you are wiped out you are out
[13:02:39] <feep[work]> not sure that applies in the current "free fed money" regimen
[13:02:39] <galambo_> feep[work], yes but initially you will be leveraging
[13:03:24] <feep[work]> galambo_: right, and that doesn't make sense to me.
[13:04:22] <feep[work]> because I expect the market to already be better at leveraging than you.
[13:04:38] <nshepperd2> leverage is just investing more money than you actually have
[13:04:54] <galambo_> the argument of lifecycle investing is. if you are young and are having a bull market you are missing out. if you are old and the market crashes you are wiped out. so why not leverage when young to get more exposure to the market when young? and then be more conservative when you grow old.
[13:05:04] <feep[work]> I get the argument
[13:05:07] <feep[work]> I want an answer to my argument
[13:06:01] <galambo_> feep[work], what do you mean that the market is better at leveraging than I am?
[13:06:12] <galambo_> do you mean I will probably be paying too much fees?
[13:06:12] <feep[work]> money is cheaper for hedgefunds than it is for you
[13:07:11] <feep[work]> if you can expand market exposure to get a greater expanded ev, I'd expect funds to already be sucking up all the free money that is available that way, and I expect that to *already put all achievable gains from leveraging back into the s&p*.
[13:08:09] <feep[work]> it's not like the market is doling out returns
[13:08:22] <feep[work]> if it is known know that a company will give huge returns in a year, the stock goes up *today*.
[13:08:23] <galambo_> feep[work], but you can also make that argument against investing without leverage
[13:08:40] <feep[work]> well, the idea is that it goes to the same ev
[13:08:45] <feep[work]> and then you just pay overhead.
[13:09:33] <corby> Do you have any recommendations for books or other resources about this finance stuff?
[13:09:35] <galambo_> I mean...no? whats the difference between investing 100% in stocks vs 2x leveraged in stocks and 50% cash?
[13:09:46] <feep[work]> cash is a separate thing
[13:09:49] <galambo_> 50% 2x leveraged stocks and 50% cash
[13:10:12] <feep[work]> I think you can't gain money but you can throw away money, and I think holding cash is an action that does that
[13:10:23] <feep[work]> it's not like I think all strategies are the same
[13:10:38] <feep[work]> it's that I think there's an exploitable ceiling, and "index over the market" is that ceiling.
[13:10:48] <galambo_> deciding to be unleveraged is just saying I want to be 1x leveraged. but why not 50% leveraged or 150% leveraged?
[13:11:29] <feep[work]> I think it's not linear.
[13:11:33] <galambo_> or I have $10000 in the bank. I can can invest 5000 or 10000 or leverage 1.5x and get 15000 exposure
[13:11:58] <galambo_> I think 1x leverage is arbitrary
[13:12:08] <galambo_> maybe the expense ratios are high. thats a valid argument
[13:12:12] <feep[work]> I think you can do worse than investing 10000. you just can't do *better* than investing 10000, by *any* means available for a possession of 10000.
[13:12:39] <galambo_> but why?
[13:12:42] <feep[work]> (discounting comparative advantage, discounting luck)
[13:12:59] <galambo_> is it a worse sharpe ratio? historical models show it is not
[13:13:10] <feep[work]> I'm not gonna explain it a third time.
[13:13:16] <feep[work]> you do you. hey, maybe it works out.
[13:13:22] <galambo_> if you combine leveraged stocks and leveraged bonds you get a better sharpe ratio. thats empirical
[13:13:31] <feep[work]> 50% of stocks empirically beat the market.
[13:13:40] <feep[work]> fhhh, can I be done with this topic please
[13:13:45] <galambo_> fine

[16:06:08] <Gurkenglas> There seems to be a trend of xrisks popping up from decentralized science. A global crackdown through diplomacy is unrealistic, but maybe there are other ways. Could a cryptocurrency-like system be designed that changes the game?
[16:08:21] <Gurkenglas> The first usecase would be for AI companies to each be owned via this system, so that the system could at some point take over decisions for all of them to prevent a race.
[16:10:03] <Gurkenglas> The second usecase could be to allocate funds to combat, such as through lobbying, research that is not controlled in this manner.
[16:11:47] <Gurkenglas> So far I've given no reason to use "cryptocurrency-like" instead of "contracts and mergers". That reason would be that we can use the vulnerability to 51% attacks to find whoever can establish sufficient cooperation and empower them yet further.
[16:12:46] <Gurkenglas> Just like a purpose of democracy is to give a better outlet to 60% of the populace than civil war.
[16:20:56] <feep[work]> mwahaha

[16:21:31] <feep[work]> I was like "hang on.... git gui blame? ohyeah, well done past me"
[16:24:25] <Gurkenglas> "git gui blame" <- I recommend that you use an IDE. When you're not sure whether a piece of code does what you think it does, do you use printf or a debugger?
[16:24:39] <feep[work]> definitely printf
[16:25:23] <feep[work]> also thanks, but I already have gdb~
[16:27:36] <Gurkenglas> Have you tried graphical debuggers? I use VSCode. You are supposed to have in view: a list of variables in scope with their values, and a list of source locations on the call stack, and mousing over a variable is supposed to show you its value, with collapsible submenus for subvariables
[16:28:13] <feep[work]> eh, I actually have a hard time seeing where that would be useful where I couldn't just dump the variable
[16:28:21] <Gurkenglas> When I tried debuggers that look like what gdb looks like in this first video google search result I understood why many people use printf
[16:28:54] <filipepe> hi fip
[16:28:56] <feep[work]> usually the difficulty is in figuring out *where* things go wrong more than how
[16:28:59] <feep[work]> hi
[16:29:50] <Gurkenglas> You're supposed to be able to do "binary" search on where things go wrong, by cheaply comparing the state of the program with what it is in your head
[16:30:05] <feep[work]> yeah but I don't see where a visual profiler helps with that
[16:30:52] <feep[work]> debugger*
[16:31:19] <Gurkenglas> i keep having videocalls with people and seeing them use printf and showing them how to use a debugger instead and they keep being strongly in favor
[16:31:30] <feep[work]> of printf?
[16:31:35] <Gurkenglas> no
[16:31:37] <feep[work]> oh lol
[16:31:42] <Gurkenglas> ...and i keep putting off writing a LW post about this...
[16:31:47] <feep[work]> well, I assure you it's not a matter of not knowing how. :P
[16:32:33] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: actually, part of it is that we don't tend to write our code in a way that's conducive to that kind of debugging
[16:33:07] <feep[work]> it's a pretty functional, lazy, chained style of D, so there generally isn't a clear callgraph or loop or even stack structure involved in the actual *algorithms*
[16:33:08] <Gurkenglas> In what manner is it not conducive? Is it like that debuggers rarely come in handy with haskell?
[16:33:31] <feep[work]> and the broader sort of design/codeflow issues tend to show themselves more as crashes than as wrong data.
[16:33:41] <kuudes> why are you getting into random fight on how should others code?

[16:34:29] <kuudes> what ide have you bought?
[16:35:05] <Gurkenglas> I have bought no IDE. I use vscode currently. I tried the pycharm professional trial and it wasnt much better than nonprofessional
[16:35:33] <kuudes> have you secured your vscode against telemetry?
[16:35:37] * Gurkenglas hasn't put this into practice, but corollary: When you don't understand the compile error what you do is you debug the compiler
[16:35:58] <feep[work]> uh
[16:36:00] <feep[work]> that is a terrible idea.
[16:36:20] <Gurkenglas> in order to understand what the compiler is telling you and why.
[16:36:25] <feep[work]> to a first approximation, you have zero shot of understanding a compiler's internal data structures.
[16:36:34] <feep[work]> no matter how complicated the error is, the code behind it is almost certainly worse.
[16:36:47] <Gurkenglas> Plausibly. The compiler should be designed to make this tractable :3
[16:36:58] <rsaarelm> I'm still using printf debugging for things. In my defense, debuggers are sorta language-dependent while printffing is universal.
[16:36:59] <feep[work]> no the compiler should be designed to give good errors :P
[16:37:07] <rsaarelm> Debugging a compiler sounds very extreme.
[16:37:10] <feep[work]> language too
[16:37:25] <Gurkenglas> Never tried it, so I shouldn't put too much stake on it :)
[16:37:26] <feep[work]> try to avoid implicit behavior and autoconversions, probably
[16:37:33] <feep[work]> that will simplify your errors
[16:38:17] <kuudes> printf debugging is usually the easiest indeed rsaarelm
[16:38:32] <Gurkenglas> <kuudes> have you secured your vscode against telemetry? <- no, should I?
[16:38:34] <feep[work]> sidenote
[16:38:41] <feep[work]> have I annoyed you guys about how cool my libidle is this year yet?
[16:38:42] <rsaarelm> My current data format parser thing in Rust feels like one of the trickier programming things I've tried to do. Already plugged in extensive optional logging that's basically persistent printf debugging.
[16:38:51] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, if you are as paranoid about asi, you likely should :-p
[16:39:11] <kuudes> *as you seem to be
[16:39:25] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, so the vscode coders don't have training data or so they don't have my research?

[18:22:01] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, namedtensors would be the obviously correct approach if order didn't matter for performance. As it is... I guess it would still be slightly better if so many of the obvious operators weren't missing?

[18:27:21] <Gurkenglas> Big if true. Does the optimizer also explain the optimizations and why other optimizations couldn't be done? Because this would seem to miss the optimizations that come from using a slightly different algorithm...
[18:33:37] <Gurkenglas> I noticed the order dependence when I tried to implement an einsum for two named tensors which specifies only the shape of the resulting tensor; I did this by flattening the first tensor into a three-dimensional abd, the second into a three-dimensional bcd, doing a batched matrix multiplication into acd, and unflattening into the required shape. turns out unflatten isn't always O(1).

[18:53:45] <catern> this reminds me of when I was at an internship and my mentor (an overweight stereotypical sysadmin) was away from his computer and I saw irssi

[18:55:28] <nshepperd2> it's blushing xD
[18:59:02] <kuudes> two2thehead, well the data is in that form, so it would take manual work to sort them the other way around in libreoffice calc
[18:59:03] <two2thehead> kuudes, for both doses, it looks like after it hits 20% inoculation, the rate of vaccination over time increases by a lot
[18:59:09] <two2thehead> ah
[18:59:52] <kuudes> two2thehead, yeah, that is because the specific risk groups of all ages were between age 70 and younger
[19:00:11] <kuudes> so about 1/4 of people got vaccinated out of age order there
[19:00:22] <kuudes> or 1/6
[19:00:24] <kuudes> ~
[19:01:13] <kuudes> and there was the issue of astrazeneca first not being approved for old people and then only approved for old people, and vaccines had to be given to the first group eligible
[19:01:39] <two2thehead> I can imagine why people are somewhat reluctant to vaccinate as fast for the 12-19 cohort. The slope, while still increasing in steepness, isn't as high
[19:01:45] <kuudes> the apparent stall around week 22 comes from the second doses of 70-74 age
[19:02:11] <kuudes> they are substantially larger population group than the ones who are older than them, and that is when their t+12 weeks from 1st dose triggered
[19:02:45] <kuudes> and the order is scheduled 2nd doses > scheduled 1st doses > unscheduled early 1st doses > unscheduled early 2nd doses
[19:02:55] <two2thehead> huh, I hadn't even considered the ratio of elderly vs not-as-elderly
[19:02:57] <two2thehead> kuudes, +1
[19:03:17] <kuudes> well, people under <16 without specific risk factor are only allowed to be vaccinated from next monday
[19:03:37] <kuudes> in the age cohorts that have been allowed to vaccinate already, ie 16-19, already 60% have got their first dose
[19:03:56] <kuudes> we don't seem to have that much of vaccination hesitancy, we just don't get vaccines faster than this
[19:04:44] <kuudes> there was a mild lag in weeks 26 to 30 also because july is the traditional holiday month in finland, so people are out of office and out of their home town and rescheduled
[19:05:11] <kuudes> basicly finland normally about closes down for july

[21:50:47] <rsaarelm> That seems like it'd help with getting your murder-rape on.
[21:51:17] <kuudes> well, longevity has increased but rather slowly
[21:51:41] <kuudes> personally I expect that I will live maybe 95, but could be less or more
[21:52:23] <kuudes> if a person lived in current finnish mortality profile, they would be expected to live 84 years on average
[21:52:53] <kuudes> but mortality has improved on all ages, and fastest in the oldest ages
[21:54:55] <kuudes> of course, who knows if there will be apocalypse before that or singularity etc

[22:10:10] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Of all the other products Sierra released in 1995, the one that came closest to matching Phantasmagoria‘s success came from good old reliable Dynamix. “I was in a high-level meeting,” remembers Dynamix’s founder Jeff Tunnell, “and the sales manager for all of Sierra said, ‘These fishing games are selling in Japan on the Nintendo.’ Everybody started laughing.
[22:10:10] <feepbot> But I said, ‘I’ll do one.'” Like Phantasmagoria, Trophy Bass was consciously designed for a different demographic than the typical computer game; it looked more at home on the shelves of Walmart than Electronics Boutique or Software Etc. It shocked everybody by outselling all other Sierra games in 1995, with the exception only of Roberta Williams’s big adventure, becoming
[22:10:10] <feepbot> in the process the best-selling game that Dynamix ever had or ever would make. Thanks to it, the later 1990s would see a flood of other fishing and hunting games, most of them executed with less love than Trophy Bass. Hardcore computers gamers scoffed at these simplistic knockoff titles and the supposed simple-minded rednecks who played them, but they sold and sold and sold.'

[23:26:41] <two2thehead> hm
[23:26:43] <adiabatic> and yes I am all three of those people
[23:27:39] <two2thehead> I've heard of identity theft, but this is ridiculous :V
[23:29:13] <gwern> two2thehead: restaurant business is so marginal that imposing any additional costs or restrictions like banning trade secrets seems bad
[23:29:35] <two2thehead> that's a great point. I hadn't considered the margin
[23:29:42] <two2thehead> okay, question withdrawn
[23:31:29] <adiabatic> I'm down with renewable-once 14-year copyrights but with trade secrets, I figure you can keep them as long as you can keep them
[23:32:42] <mst> saturn2: every time I read the acronym EMH I get the urge to say "please state the nature of the capitalism emergency"
[23:34:53] <gwern> yeah, there's a nice aspect of trade secrets in that they are in a sense, time-scaled patents: if you can keep a trade secret for a very long time, that suggests either it's not very valuable (and so excluding others from it is pretty harmless) or that it is very hard/expensive/non-obvious and you should be rewarded a lot for coming up with it (and so excluding others from it is valuable)
[23:35:56] <adiabatic> plus it's easy to write shit recipes for good foods
[23:36:22] <adiabatic> I wouldn't want a restaurant open to legal risk from a nuisance lawsuit because nobody can replicate the recipe
[23:36:26] <gwern> so if you come up with an awesome molecular gastronomy recipe which leaves other chefs going "impossible!!! but *how*?!" and they can't figure it out even knowing what the output is and eating it themselves, then godspeed, keep that trade secret for as long as you can and profit off it for being so awesome
[23:36:59] <adiabatic> yeah, the OS requirement is a tax that weighs heavier on novelty, and I like novelty
[23:37:50] <gwern> (and if you have a new recipe which makes another chef go "oh. yeah, that's just X, Y, and then a Z at the end" and they can copy it instantly, well, then why should you be rewarded lucratively for it?)
