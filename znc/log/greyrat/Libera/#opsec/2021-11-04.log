[04:51:47] <ilikeyou> what up, fam
[04:51:58] <Joanna> Hi ilikeyou
[04:52:22] <Joanna> Have you seen videos jan6 posted about fake internet
[04:52:32] <Joanna> I need to watch again..
[04:59:06] <vaio> fake inernet ?
[04:59:13] <vaio> (hi)
[04:59:20] <vaio> is it related to the empty internet theory ?
[04:59:37] <Joanna> Yea that’s it
[04:59:42] <Joanna> Maybe
[05:00:13] <Joanna> Most things are ai and fake accounts and broken links etc
[05:00:53] <vaio> ah, yeah
[05:00:55] <Joanna> So much garbage on internet like website after website with the same exact thing on it
[05:03:10] *** Joins: HaMsTeRs (~Thunderbi@14-0-175-120.static.pccw-hkt.com)
[05:03:31] <vaio> well, who isn't running bot, nowadays .. :D
[05:04:21] <HaMsTeRs> Hello Everyone,  is a $1,413.39 USD for a 2020 13" i5 Macbook pro w/16GB RAM + 1TB SSD + 4x Thunderbolt (Space Gray) port a good deal?
[05:07:11] <Joanna> Hi HaMsTeRs possibly ok
[05:07:30] <HaMsTeRs> thanks Joanna.  So it's like a fair deal :D
[05:09:18] <Joanna> I asked someone I know
[05:09:42] <Joanna> He said depends upon what you will use it for
[05:10:13] <HaMsTeRs> :D thanks.   because I'm an SI technical consultant, I uses it to build some lightweight labs and daily document works.   
[05:10:25] <HaMsTeRs> so an x86_x64 is a must.   even though I really like the M1
[05:10:37] <HaMsTeRs> but I can't.  because I do a lot of Windows Server labs
[05:13:35] <Joanna> I think it all comes down to which os you prefer using
[05:14:53] <HaMsTeRs> this moment, I moved from Windows to full Linux (Ubuntu and Arch).  But really like mac for their security
[05:18:10] <Joanna> I’ve heard that Apple wants to start scanning everyone’s pictures for child porn as a pretext?
[05:18:55] <Joanna> I don’t trust any company these days
[05:20:01] <Joanna> It never fails to amaze me what people will tolerate after some insulting accusation.
[05:21:09] <HaMsTeRs> I heard that also, but I think there's a huge arguing about this out there
[05:21:41] <HaMsTeRs> Me neither.  But out of Microsoft, Apple, and Google, I rather trust Apple
[05:22:38] <ilikeyou> Hi Joanna , i haven't seen it, but i'll take a look at it
[05:24:41] <shibboleth> Joanna, remember the period between 2007 and what... 2013 or thereabouts
[05:25:04] <kveroneau> HaMsTeRs, if you are worried about security on Linux, use firejail, VMs, and containers. :)
[05:25:10] <shibboleth> when every single ios/droid app had full access to gallery and lots of other stuff without asking
[05:25:31] <kveroneau> HaMsTeRs, firejail:  https://firejail.wordpress.com/
[05:25:31] <SeaDough> ^ Firejail | security sandbox
[05:26:12] <shibboleth> HaMsTeRs, trust apple?
[05:26:27] <HaMsTeRs> semi trust (out of those three companies) :D
[05:26:33] <vaio> i heard firejail wasn't that good
[05:26:35] <HaMsTeRs> thanks
[05:26:37] <kveroneau> When I run apps, such as Firefox, it only has access to the parts of my OS that I say it can have access to, including devices and file systems.  So Firefox sees an almost empty $HOME directory with a single Downloads directory, and nothing else. :D
[05:27:19] <kveroneau> vaio, where did you hear that?  If you have an article you could link, I'd love to read it to better protect my security.
[05:27:46] <shibboleth> HaMsTeRs, problem is, trusting apple is quite an... involved affair. since they're in control of every aspect
[05:28:09] <shibboleth> hardware,firmware,software,services,permissions
[05:28:10] <kveroneau> From the hardware, to the software, and the cloud.
[05:28:43] <shibboleth> and content
[05:28:47] * kveroneau wouldn't be surprised if the M1 chip had a backdoor on it like the IME chip.
[05:28:59] <HaMsTeRs> shibboleth: the trust I mean is like: I let it collect my information, but don't think they will share it away with marketing or other companies..
[05:28:59] <shibboleth> that's quite a few eggs to be placing in the same basket
[05:29:13] <HaMsTeRs> like not what GOODLE does.  Google is a prick
[05:30:49] *** kveroneau is now known as TheConstipatedKi
[05:31:04] <shibboleth> well, scroogle and fakebook already have their arm up your ass
[05:31:04] <Joanna> There settings to deny access to things on iOS but who knows if there isn’t a way around that..
[05:31:14] *** TheConstipatedKi is now known as kveroneau
[05:31:50] <HaMsTeRs> Just heard a news that Microsoft revealed a flaw on MacOS
[05:32:38] <kveroneau> I heard that Microsoft released spyware for Linux recently.  The Edge Browser!
[05:33:27] <Joanna> Microsoft seems to be trying to take over linux lately..
[05:34:51] <ilikeyou>  I dpn
[05:35:24] <ilikeyou> i don't think they are trying to take over, i think it's more about incorporating it's benefits. and i think they are doing a poor job
[05:35:30] <ilikeyou> IMO
[05:36:12] <ilikeyou> i've been using powershell and some other hallmark microsoft apps , and i can't stand it

[05:41:04] <Joanna> ilikeyou: I wonder how much money they donate to opensource projects to gain influence
[05:43:30] <vaio> kveroneau: i don't have any specific article; but firejail is kindof a "huge blog"
[05:43:35] <vaio> there are lighter alternatives
[05:43:43] <vaio> also, check the unresolved issues on their github
[05:43:54] <vaio> well, perhaps it changed since i had that discussion
[05:44:40] <kveroneau> vaio, Security bugs are taken seriously, please email them to netblue30 at protonmail.com
[05:44:53] <kveroneau> I guess that line on the website is not to be believed. :(
[05:45:47] <vaio> well
[05:45:56] <kveroneau> 272 issues on GitHub.  Well.  I hope that the Debian package has at least backported patches and is using the least insecure version.
[05:46:05] <vaio> "as a vpn provider we won't log your ip"
[05:46:09] <vaio> is kindof the same thing
[05:46:16] <kveroneau> lmfao
[05:46:31] <vaio> (if you see what i mean)
[05:48:25] <kveroneau> vaio, just read the first page of issues on GitHub.  None of these are reporting security issues, they are either a random stupid question from someone who can't look at the docs like "How do I run firefox with firejail", and a lot of feature requests.
[05:49:26] <kveroneau> vaio, what would prove to me that firejail is broken or worse than say running Firefox without firejail, is a prove of concept program or website that breaks it's security.
[05:50:25] <kveroneau> Personally, right now, I'd rather run any browser in any sort of jail rather than letting it have access to all the resources on my system.  A bug in the browser can cause more issues to my system if it's not jailed.
[05:52:27] <kveroneau> Here's an issue someone opened to ask if they can deliberately run malware in a firejail haha: https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/issues/3082
[05:52:28] <SeaDough> ^ Firejail safe enough to deliberately execute malware ? · Issue #3082 · netblue30/firejail · GitHub
[05:54:30] <kveroneau> Okay, this issue was classified as a potential security bug: https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/issues/510
[05:54:32] <SeaDough> ^ Use privilege separation · Issue #510 · netblue30/firejail · GitHub

[05:58:24] <kveroneau> Did find a Reddit, and it seems the main concern is that its a rather large SUID binary with a lot going on.  I get that, and I do see the risk in having it installed in specific environments.
[06:01:58] <vaio> btw, i meant "blob" and not "blog"
