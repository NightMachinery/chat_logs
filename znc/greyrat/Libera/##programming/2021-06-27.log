[02:08:23] <Valware> with ircv3 shit, like BotServ is gonna send a 0.5 second long typing notification to the destination when you use something like /msg botserv say

[02:09:03] <Valware> I just want to make IRC and web integration as easy as possible
[02:09:12] <Valware> there aren't really too many options I can find
[02:09:16] <Valware> so I thought I'd create it
[02:09:49] <Valware> for example, anope's SQL "integration" is pants, if you registered on your chosen third-party site and then connected without a password before you had identified for the first time, it will not protect it
[02:10:14] <Valware> no matter what you do. you can put the user information in anope's sql database and it still WILL NOT recognise the user exists until after it identifies for the first time
[02:10:18] <Valware> shit like this
[02:10:21] <Valware> I will close these gaps
[02:10:34] <Valware> I will integrate with all your third-party web applications, like wordpress, joomla, whatever
[02:10:55] <Valware> the browser is nearly as old as IRC
[02:10:59] <Valware> (yes IRC came first)
[02:11:11] <Valware> but it exists alongside it without touching it too much
[02:11:13] <Valware> I wanna change that
[02:11:37] <Valware> I will provide extra shit
[02:12:00] <Valware> like if you provide a webchat that includes children, I will have extra modules for getting their age and also being able to restrict channels by age
[02:12:08] <Valware> say for example, an under 18's chat
[02:12:19] <Valware> you'd wanna keep the pervs at bay
[02:12:33] <Valware> my chanserv will have a module for restricting channels by age
[02:12:44] <Valware> safety online needs improving...
[02:13:53] <Valware> IRC is IRC and I don't want to change it. but I do want to bring it to everyone and make it super easy for anyone to have their own chat platform with as much customisation as possible in the backend
[02:14:05] <mrig> costs of safety are usually loss of freedoms.

[02:14:36] <Valware> freedom to stay safe is necessary
[02:14:41] <mrig> dont believe in padded cells for the entire world personally.
[02:14:55] <mrig> with plastic knives and forks.
[02:15:04] <Valware> I believe in protecting our children (who by the way will be running the world in 20-30 years time)
[02:15:10] <Twipply> I imagine the internet is a far safer place now than when we all first got on it
[02:15:22] <Valware> either way, I think it's a nice option to be able to have
[02:15:26] <mrig> children learn from bups and scratches.
[02:15:38] <mrig> would hate to be a kid today, the poor souls.
[02:15:46] <Valware> yeah right
[02:15:47] <wovixo> Didn't Slack already bring IRC to everyone? Albeit badly?
[02:15:48] <Valware> lot of pressure
[02:16:12] <mrig> man when I was a kid you could go out, there were no mobile phones, the rule was that you had to be back before dark.
[02:16:32] <mrig> no pressure, as hole selfish parrents
[02:16:38] <Twipply> Who wants to go outside when there's internet inside?
[02:16:45] <mrig> who dont know how to grow old gracefully.
[02:17:00] <Valware> yeah now all the kids are "what are other people doing online and what are their opinions of me", which is ridiculous but undoubtably a lot of pressure
[02:17:19] <mrig> really issues with not knowing how to grow up at the moment.
[02:17:37] <Valware> I like Sheldon's quote from The Big Bang Theory - "If outside is so great, why has mankind spent so many years perfecting inside"
[02:17:37] <mrig> not knowing how to live.

[06:42:50] <PicklePuffer> im reading yellow book now

[06:43:45] <PicklePuffer> if such a thing exists 
[06:43:56] <PicklePuffer> but it doesn't bridge gap between what is actually required in industry 
[06:44:12] <Arahael> Ah, "The C# Programming Yellow Book", by Rob Miles.
[06:44:19] <PicklePuffer> yep
[06:46:11] <Arahael> Anyway, I don't have any specific recommendations - if at a 'high level', I'd just focus on the programming "patterns".

[06:51:34] <Arahael> The term "middleware" is vague.  It can either refer to the "middleware" in a web service, which sits between your method implementations and the actual http endpoint - often adding things like logging, authentication, caching, document transformations, etc.
[06:52:03] <Arahael> Or it can refer to an actual microservice if you're using a microservice arch, but the intention is still similar: It adds or modifies the requests or responses in various generic ways.

[10:53:02] <novns> by using half-colored tapes and shifting them
[10:53:34] <chronon> I run my terminal with a light background. I had to give up on using weechat for that reason, as it makes too many assumptions in too many places that everyone uses and can read dark terminals.
[10:55:05] <novns> xeno, that's why red-black binary search trees are called like this
[10:55:24] <chronon> Dark terminals look super leet but they hurt my eyes quinting to read them, so I'm stuck with a light terminal, and had to switch to irssi because it was easier to setup the colours well. (Or maybe irssi just makes the opposite assumption that most people will be on light terminals).

[12:44:37] <paulo_> it's good resume filler
[12:45:15] <matsurago> Some DevOps positions may require AWS/Azure certificate. As for programming, I never heard anyone would care to require a cert, nor that it would have any benefit
[12:46:15] <PlanckWalk> You can definitely have a career without them.  There may be some options you don't get, though.
[12:46:28] <matsurago> As for non-programming stuff, network admins may need CISSP or something like that, and security specialists may need ISC^2
[12:47:10] <novns> rexar89, if you have a certificate you will be ordered to place a sample of anomalous material into an anti-mass spectrometer for analysis
[12:47:33] <novns> and you should better not!
[12:47:42] <rexar89> ok :D

[12:54:40] <TheWild> folks, the weak bits of my memory tell me there was a scripting language (computer algebra system related?) that used "intersection" (intersect?) and "union" (no | or &) as operators, like in "A union B", and I now can't figure out what was that.
[12:55:20] <GeDaMo> Could it be SQL?
[12:55:24] <rexar89> TheWild: I know python has those  too
[12:55:44] <rexar89> the set data type
[12:56:11] <TheWild> GeDaMo: yeah, that's one of the candidates, but if it was SQL I would remember writing UNION and INTERSECTION in uppercase
[12:56:44] <rexar89> oh keywords "UNION" and "INTERSECTION"

[15:49:40] <StayHungry> in my case, var is declared not even in a loop, but in for (here) part
[15:49:54] <pikapika> In javascript declarations via the 'var' keyword unlike what you expect from C, Java etc the variable is accessible throughout the function
[15:50:07] <pikapika> StayHungry, in C++ and Java an i declared that way is only confined inside the loop

[15:55:36] <pikapika> StayHungry, thats because you are always initializing i to 1 before each iteration in the second loop
[15:55:45] <pikapika> I don't know why the second line isn't erroring out
[15:55:57] <xsperry> I wouldn't group python together with the other 3 languages.. it has extremely peculiar scoping rules, that change from version to version
[15:56:14] <pikapika> The semicolon has a special meaning inside a for header
[15:56:33] <pikapika> xsperry, what do you mean? Are you referring to function closures?
[15:56:38] <xsperry> no
[15:56:47] <StayHungry> first line works as expected, second one outputs "Microsoft JScript compilation error: Syntax error"
[15:57:04] <pikapika> StayHungry, when you write the first semicolon you are basically declaring that the 'initialization' part of the for loop is over and the next code is inside the 'condition check' part
[15:57:12] <pikapika> Are you reading what I am saying?
[15:57:17] <StayHungry> of course
[15:57:25] <StayHungry> just adding details
[15:57:29] <xsperry> I'm referring to 1) list comprehensions and loops leaking variables outside of them in 2x, but not in 3x (at least for LC, I'm not sure about loops. 2) shit like this:https://twitter.com/gvanrossum/status/1354305179244392453
[15:57:33] <pikapika> StayHungry, and in the second line which means you now have ;;; inside your loop
[15:57:36] <pikapika> which is illegal
[15:57:47] <pikapika> your second loop looks like for(...;...;...;...)
[15:58:04] <StayHungry> so i'm allowed to use ; only once there, right?
[15:58:05] <pikapika> the first for loop is the correct for(...;...;...)
[15:58:12] <pikapika> Did you even read this line?

[15:59:02] <pikapika> You can't have statements inside for loop
[15:59:03] <xsperry> another issue with python (that's exposed in the code on the link above) is that assignment has the same syntax as variable declaration
[15:59:12] <pikapika> the semicolon isn't a statement delimiter inside the for header
[15:59:17] <pikapika> It delimits parts of the for loop header

[16:00:55] <pikapika> StayHungry, a comma can be used to put multiple lines without using a semicolon
[16:01:04] <pikapika> Which is why we use commas in the for loop
[16:01:05] <pikapika> However

[16:04:32] <KillerWasp> It's fun to see how they try to figure out how javascript really works, when in reality it's undefined behavior.
[16:05:35] <pikapika> Does js have undefined behaviour?
[16:06:02] <pikapika> Undefined behaviour is a C term that has a very specific meaning
[16:06:45] <KillerWasp> pikapika# I mean how it actually acts, not a term or a mistake in the language.
[16:07:09] <pikapika> Clarify
[16:07:12] <pikapika> I am still confused
[16:07:24] <KillerWasp> I guess it works better if you take away all the spaces and the newlines, and all the variables only have 1 letter.
[16:07:27] <pikapika> That 'var' is function scoped is not undefined
[16:07:37] <pikapika> Its very clear and intentional what it means
[16:07:54] <pikapika> ASI is not undefined
[16:08:01] <pikapika> But its hard and confusing on the human being
[16:09:13] <KillerWasp> pikapika# It is easier to blame the programmer for language failures. But it is clearly a broken language, because it cannot support any code that works correctly in C, despite looking similar.
[16:09:28] <pikapika> Obviously

[16:12:20] <pikapika> What really prickles me about js is that it manages to have a combination of some really good features and some atrocious stuff
[16:12:36] <pikapika> If it was only atrocious or boring then I probably won't dislike it as much
[16:13:30] <pikapika> That functions are first class and can be nested, created and passed everywhere with a mostly uniform syntax is nice. 'var', type coercions, ASI are bad.
[16:14:50] <pikapika> a syntax that superficially looks like C is a plus for me, but on the other hand due to the language actually being fundamentally different from C in ways others like Java or PHP aren't makes this a negative

[16:20:45] <pikapika> KillerWasp, java won't have been so bad in itself if android were designed like a sane desktop os in that there is one language that was used to write the os and the standard api for it, but the design is such that anyone is free to develop any langauge for it

[16:25:09] <pikapika> Its really strange how writing programs for a powerful desktop os with target machines generally more powerful than a typical android phone takes far less resources than building an android app
[16:25:18] <DPA> It'd be great if async/await came to c, in a fashion that integrates seamlessly with existing sync c / callbacks. Then we could have nicer async read / write etc. syscalls and such things.

[16:29:48] <KillerWasp> Many times I think that buying an ARM with built-in wifi and building your own mobile phone device is much better than buying a mobile phone.
[16:29:54] <DarkTrick> hm
[16:30:02] <mrig> there is a vast spectrum of different types of minds.
[16:30:05] <pikapika> Human context switching is extremely costly
[16:30:07] <mrig> thankfully.
[16:30:15] <pikapika> And we need to context switch because we don't have true parallel

[17:50:29] * Solak is currently reading about Python...
[17:51:25] <Solak> not sure though I'm going to like that language :/
[17:52:43] <InPhase> Solak: Python is one of the top general purpose languages now for smaller scale programs where peak performance is not critical but which will benefit from a rich assortment of good libraries.
[17:53:17] <InPhase> Solak: Which happens to be a pretty decent cross-section of needed programs.
[17:55:01] <Solak> I guess that Python starts to resemble the easy use javascript has due to the browser.
[17:55:42] <Solak> InPhase: what is your definition of 'smaller scale'?
[17:56:37] <Solak> I must admit that C is still my favorite language, and 2nd favorite is Object Pascal.
[17:57:14] *** Quits: Rayke (rayke@user/rayke) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[17:57:29] <InPhase> Solak: Well, perhaps the scale where you can sit down and understand the whole program without getting hungry, and where you can hold pretty much the whole program in your head at once then.
[17:57:42] *** Joins: Rayke (rayke@user/rayke)
[17:57:42] <InPhase> Solak: Or at least the whole program structure.
[17:57:49] <piou> I'd agree with that definition
[17:58:04] <pikapika> Python is very pleasant

[17:58:44] <piou> Python's flexibility is its main strength, but when the program starts becoming too big to be understood at once having more ways to tighten things down becomes more valuable
[17:58:57] <InPhase> Solak: If you're an experienced programmer and you spend a week working on something and you haven't really understood it all, then it might have been larger than Python was a good choice for.
[17:58:58] *** Quits: Rayke (rayke@user/rayke) (Client Quit)

[18:01:06] <InPhase> Solak: There aren't really strict dividing lines.  Sometimes the good libraries make something a little larger worth doing in Python.  Sometimes a Python program grows a little out of control but is still a good choice and pretty clean code.  Sometimes the Python scaling issues start to inflict self-harm after something grows out of control and you would have been better off with other choices.
[18:01:26] <Solak> InPhase, piou: hmm, I guess that switching from js to python isn't a good idea in this particular case :)

[18:02:18] <InPhase> Solak: This is about languages that restrict or languages that are free-form and unconstrained.
[18:02:34] <pikapika> InPhase, ultimately the programmer themselves end up implementing a type system any time a dynamic lang project gets large enough
[18:02:50] <pikapika> Obviously such type system is based upon lots and lots of if elses and tests
[18:03:22] <InPhase> pikapika: Yeah...  I admit I have some Python code which has elements of this...
[18:03:43] <InPhase> A bit of proper dispatch support would be really nice.  :)
[18:04:01] <piou> twisted reimplementing interfaces is a good example
[18:04:15] <Solak> and it may be the reason why I get frustrated with js, converting a 15k+ lines piece of C code to js/python may be a bit too much...
[18:04:44] <InPhase> Solak: Yeah, that's probably a bad idea.
[18:04:53] <piou> Solak: do you need to convert it? Interfacing is also an option
[18:05:03] <pikapika> Sometimes it may not be possible
[18:05:06] <InPhase> Solak: Python is great at being able to call C code though.

[18:07:02] <flax> pikapika: Hello.
[18:07:11] <InPhase> flax: C is not a modern language, so this is barking up the wrong tree.  The next step is to learn C++ which supports more modern idioms.
[18:07:19] <pikapika> InPhase, thats a C++ book

[18:17:44] <flax> mrig: Are you asking about "The C Programming Language"? I may have skipped some similar exercises.
[18:17:48] <InPhase> mrig: Yes.  Yes you are.  :)
[18:18:15] <piou> pikapika: I know a lot of people have a lot of nostalgy for K&R, but it's just bad IMHO. Is it teaching programming? Not really, it's teaching a language. Sure there are some basic exercises but it says nothing of how to design an actual program and everything that goes into programming aside from the pure "how to write a for loop". Does it teach C well then? No, it's missing many important parts
[18:18:22] <piou> that were added later to the language, it dosen't show many idioms that are common today, and many idioms it does teach are just plain bad because they predate the great age of buffer overflows and the care that the whole industry has since put into developing practices to avoid them (ex: don't use strcpy by default etc). So in my view it fails at teaching the language, it doesn't even try to
[18:18:28] <piou> teach programming, it's at best a first step filled with caveats and bad habits. A great piece of history but not something I would ever recommend as a first book to anyone.
[18:18:39] <flax> mrig: I feel Margarest Hamilton would be an exceptionally beautiful woman if she was not too skinny.
[18:18:49] <flax> s/would/would have been/

[18:19:00] <pikapika> No programming language text teaches programming in general
[18:19:07] <pikapika> They just teach a language syntax
[18:19:20] <pikapika> K&R is good it teaches via examples of how to make various os and C library concepts
[18:19:28] <mrig> flax: I was just wondering myself where one has to go to meet ladys of this kind :)
[18:19:39] <flax> pikapika: Is there something you would suggest?
[18:19:51] <flax> mrig: What kind of ladies you are looking to meet?
[18:19:53] <Solak> pikapika: there are books that try to teach programming by using a language (i.e. Eloquent Javascript).
[18:20:02] <mrig> InPhase: Obviously one has to imagine her with appropriate buns in hair.
[18:20:04] <piou> pikapika: that's wrong, SICP for example explicitely teaches more about programming in general and design that it teaches about its language. It doesn't even mention what many consider to be the strength of lisp (its macros) in order to keep the language simple and avoid distraction from the architectural discussion
[18:20:07] <pikapika> Solak, I didn't know of them

[18:22:27] <InPhase> flax: So being a solid unix programmer does not require focusing exclusively on C.  Nearly everything I write is primarily for or used on Linux, and I barely write anything in C these days.  But picking up C++ was one of those things that improved my C when I was doing it, because it helps highlight the need for things like keeping data coupled together.

[18:23:45] <piou> pikapika: of course not, but some books accomplish something
[18:23:52] <pikapika> SICP due to its lisp focus probably doesn't tell you about pointers
[18:24:03] <piou> pikapika: it doesn't, but it doesn't need to
[18:24:06] <pikapika> One must complement it with a book on assembly and architecture
[18:24:11] <piou> pikapika: not in that way at least
[18:24:33] <piou> pikapika: actually no, that's not a necessary complement IMHO
[18:24:34] <InPhase> flax: That Stroustrup book is a highly recommended one, yes.  And part of the point would be learning how to work with OOP, so that even if you use C for something, you can start organizing your structs better with those mindsets.
[18:24:36] <deniska> flax: the book? Yeah, it's fine

[18:25:01] <rindolf> mrig: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-LfQCPJJkY
[18:25:03] <Solak> hmm, what is your opinion on Pascal, in particular Object Pascal (Delphi, FPC)?
[18:25:13] <pikapika> If your first language is lisp you have a very wrong mental model of computer hardware in your head
[18:25:19] <InPhase> flax: The most important parts of OOP are not things like inheritance.  Those are mostly gimmicks.  It's largely about organizing data and associated behavior.
[18:25:21] <pikapika> Thats why you must also read a book on asm and architecture
[18:25:27] <rindolf> Solak: pascal is mostly dead
[18:26:09] <Solak> pikapika: in the early days children were using Logo to lean programming :)
[18:26:11] <flax> mrig: She looks to me like the combination of Grace Slick and Richard Stallman. I mean a hippie programmer. There must have been plenty around in 1960s, not many women though.
[18:26:15] <pikapika> Solak, yes
[18:26:16] <piou> pikapika: you're making the assumption that you need a very exact model of hardware, and that's just not true for most programmers. That's not even the main thing by far.
[18:26:29] <mrig> I was trying to find any talks given by Margret Hamilton, but as yet have not found anything.
[18:26:42] <piou> pikapika: not that it's useless, but it's not necessary by any means to be successful
[18:26:44] <flax> InPhase: Okay.
[18:26:52] <pikapika> piou, but working without having at least some intuition how the code works in hwardware is insane
[18:27:09] <flax> mrig: Apparently, she is still alive.
[18:27:23] <flax> mrig: You may want to write her a letter/mail though.
[18:27:24] <Solak> pikapika: but they probably got the right hardware-model because they learned asm as well :)
[18:27:26] <piou> pikapika: it's not if it works. The moment you have abstractions then unrderstanding how to work within that abstraction is more important that how it behaves below
[18:27:46] <flax> pikapika: I agree.

[18:28:59] <immibis> you don't want to be writing code like for(thing : things) {thing.updatePosition();} because your compiler won't be able to use SIMD for that.

[18:29:21] <mrig> immibis: there is noting stopping you from putting an array of some object or a vector inside of a class.

[18:29:28] <Solak> rindolf: when I look at fpc/lazarus I wouldn't say it is dead, but true, it probably doesn't have a large community like i.e. python, js, C, C++ have.
[18:29:38] <mrig> this would be composition.
[18:29:40] <pikapika> piou, of course I do not doubt its a good book

[18:29:58] <pikapika> And its on my list
[18:30:07] <InPhase> immibis: Yes, performance routines should have data organized in a cache friendly manner.  But that doesn't invalidate OOP organization.  It just means people were using OOP unthinkingly in ways that didn't meet their performance needs.
[18:30:13] <rindolf> immibis: re "oop": https://github.com/shlomif/Freenode-programming-channel-FAQ/blob/master/FAQ_with_ToC__generated.md#what-does-object-oriented-programming--oop--mean
[18:30:17] <immibis> mrig: sure, but OOP tells you to write: class Thing {Vec3 position; Vec3 velocity; int animationFrame; ...}
[18:30:17] <Solak> immibis: you mean there is a trend towards functional programming?
[18:30:34] <Solak> I must admit that I still like OOP.
[18:30:35] <immibis> Solak: they call this particular thing data-oriented design, or the structure-of-arrays pattern
[18:30:42] <immibis> it's nothing to do with functional programming
[18:30:47] <pikapika> FP is very tough to understand
[18:30:49] <Solak> ah, ok.
[18:30:55] <immibis> and I think for high performance programs it's an extremely important problem with OOP
[18:31:00] <pikapika> Its too complex
[18:31:19] <immibis> pikapika: that's just because functional programmers like their mathematical abstractions. It doesn't *have* to be that way
[18:31:27] <Solak> pikapika: but probably more intuitive for software that relies a lot on math...
[18:31:36] <pikapika> Solak, actually no

[18:31:49] <pikapika> Today they probably use MATLAB more
[18:31:53] <pikapika> and CAS systems
[18:32:12] <deniska> One common misconception some C programmers have is that they understand how computers work
[18:32:18] <piou> pikapika: interestingly I'm pretty sure the reason why you find FP difficult and the reason why you can't fathom thinking about programming without thinking about how it is executed in the hardware are intimately related

[18:33:32] <pikapika> Closures are confusing but sort of understandable as a function pointer + a struct
[18:33:39] <deniska> I guess you should know about CPU caches and data locality, but C exposes you to them in the same fashion java or python does
[18:33:44] <immibis> pikapika: eh, depends on your performance needs. I want the inner game loop to use as many SIMD operations as possible. But I don't give as much of a damn about the JSON loading. That can be whatever is convenient. I don't have to know how the library parses JSON, to use it
[18:34:09] <pikapika> Obviously simple, low frequency tasks like loading your config file can be done anywhere

[18:37:35] <immibis> Solak: it is actually interesting how hardware runs lazy functional languages, and I don't know enough details to reconstruct it, but they have something like a stack of expressions being evaluated; each value is represented as a function that returns the value; on the first call it computes the value and then overwrites itself

[18:38:18] <immibis> <InPhase> immibis: Yes, performance routines should have data organized in a cache friendly manner.  But that doesn't invalidate OOP organization.  It just means people were using OOP unthinkingly in ways that didn't meet their performance needs.
[18:38:27] <Solak> immibis: interesting...
[18:38:31] <immibis> It invalidates this notion that OOP is a good thing. It's now degraded down to: OOP is a thing

[18:38:48] <immibis> which, like most things, is sometimes good and sometimes bad)
[18:38:54] <piou> pikapika: what about seeing it that way: a C pointer is an abstraction. It has nothing to do with the hardware. It works within the abstraction of the C abstract machine that is a set of conventions defined by the standard on how C behaves. The fact that a C pointer is often translated into a hardware pointer is nice, but that's an implementation detail. It certainly doesn't have to. Now, none of
[18:39:00] <piou> that prevents you from writting effective C. It's not so much that you have a good understanding of the hardware in that case, it's that you have a good understanding of the C abstract machine, its model, its abstraction, and you modeled your understanding of the hardware on that. The actual hardware does ungodly things that aren't represented in C in the slightest. Now, with that in mind,

[18:39:04] <pikapika> immibis, its all subject to trend cycles
[18:39:06] <piou> languages like lisp or haskell aren't that foreign. They just have a different base abstraction, a different abstract machine, a different set of rules on which you build. That's why I say that the illusion that you understand the hardware is keeping you from understanding FP.

[18:39:54] <rindolf> beaky: heh
[18:39:54] <pikapika> that even the asm programmer isn't able to see
[18:40:00] <piou> indeed
[18:40:06] <InPhase> immibis: I do a lot of high performance numerical computing, but I also do a lot of OOP.  When I want performance on a routine, I reorder the data so that it's cache efficient in structure.  When I want clean storage of data, it looks more OOP like.
[18:40:13] <vdamewood> rindolf: What point are you trying ot make with that?
[18:40:18] <immibis> InPhase: so I'm no longer convinced that OOP is something everyone should learn. At least not unless they also learn DOD as an alternative, and can apply both depending on the situation.
[18:40:23] <pikapika> But still C and asm are "close enough" to actual working of hardware that they should provide an intuition about what kinds of code is good and what is bad for your computer
[18:40:48] <pulse> vdamewood, i'm 100% sure rindolf actually thinks posting links every 3 minutes is actually normal behavior on irc
[18:40:53] <vdamewood> I would say that C is different enough that it's not useful for that.
[18:40:54] <pulse> that's why he's so defensive any time he gets called on it
[18:40:59] <immibis> pikapika: I seem to know C as: high-level assembly + as-if rule + undefined behaviour (justified by enabling more optimization)
[18:41:01] <rindolf> pulse: well, "fear" is haunting my media
[18:41:03] <piou> pikapika: That's only because you work on computers that modeled their top-level abstraction on C, not the other way arround
[18:41:05] <InPhase> immibis: I favor people learning both.  There are a large number of things you have to do differently to your code when you want peak cache performance.
[18:41:10] <immibis> yes, that is probably good
[18:41:16] *** Joins: SolderFlux (~Test@ool-2f105398.dyn.optonline.net)
[18:41:28] <vdamewood> pulse: I'm aware.
[18:41:30] <immibis> so, in my mind, C is still high-level assembly, but it passes through an optimizer on the way to actual assembly. That optimizer has a bunch of additional rules.
[18:41:35] <rindolf> vdamewood: that ##programming-ops is divide&conquer
[18:41:44] <pikapika> piou, those other computers are so obscure that knowing they are probably with specialized languages, tools and domains
[18:41:52] <piou> pikapika: but it doesn't matter, you're still working within an abstraction and trusting the implementation to act as the rules of this abstraction dictate. And that's why FP shouldn't scare you. It's not even less efficient.
[18:41:59] <immibis> you could also apply a C optimizer to assembly code, if someone did the work to enable that - it's not specific to C
[18:42:05] <InPhase> immibis: I think encapsulation and its robustnes benefits for locking behavior down are too important to abandon though.  This is also very important for numerical work, where you need some values to have high guarantees.
[18:42:21] <piou> *necessarily less efficient
[18:42:26] <pikapika> Its not about efficiency. Its that its highly opaque where the mallocs and frees are occuring or how currying is treated in ram and cpu etc
[18:42:29] <pikapika> Its very opaque
[18:42:35] <pikapika> Its not about efficiency
[18:42:58] <immibis> pikapika: you can learn these things about haskell
[18:43:06] <piou> pikapika: C is opaque as well, all abstractions are. Some give you control over different things that's all. I'm not saying all abstractions are equal, but the difference isn't there
[18:43:17] <rindolf> try me, mr. Fear, try me
[18:43:17] <pikapika> Like if we look at a typical C or python program, we can get a decent intuition how it executes
[18:43:32] <pikapika> Haskell, its very hard to do the same
[18:43:37] <beaky> yes in haskell you have lazy evaluation
[18:43:44] <pulse> nice, i'm lazy
[18:43:46] <pikapika> piou, I am not saying I dsilike FP or consider it inferior
[18:43:52] <beaky> whereas almost every other programming language is strict evaluation
[18:43:53] <pikapika> Just that its naturally more difficult to understand
[18:44:03] <pikapika> Lazy eval also adds another uncertainty
[18:44:04] <pikapika> yes
[18:44:18] <vdamewood> rindolf: No. It's just an effort to decrease the noise in this channel.
[18:44:29] <InPhase> immibis: That conversion mapping between OOP and DOD doesn't actually apply for most things.  It really only kicks in when you start vectorizing large amounts of data where you will access all the common sub-pieces in a sequence.  This pattern shows up a lot in games, and shows up a lot in numerical calculations, but is not a common process flow in other areas.
[18:44:42] <rindolf> vdamewood: is not
[18:44:59] <piou> pikapika: that's because you built your intuition on C and python, and going against that can be difficult. I'm just saying that the first step is to break the illusion of the relation to the hardware, because without that it'll be very difficult to accept the new rules you must abide by, and once you master these rules they won't feel any bit less opaque as C or python
[18:45:15] <pulse> rindolf, you know i like you man, but can you imagine if everyone just posted links all day long?

[18:46:02] <pulse> post a link once per day when it's contextual
[18:46:04] <pikapika> Well thats not wholly true. Its clear what happens when you do a loop or when you use a fucntion or a closure. Its much harder to see the highly abstract haskell features mapping to what happens in real life.

[23:45:26] <lazar> Hi. I'm 100% pro gay. I am not a homophobe.
[23:45:48] <lazar> Have you ever worked for free, anyone of you, just because you were bored?
[23:45:53] <lazar> or just wanted something done?

[23:53:35] <pulse> i'm slightly homophobic, sometimes i dream i'm in a night club having fun and then suddenly barely dressed men start dancing to YMCA
[23:53:37] <xeno> lazar: when I code voluntarily outside of working hours, it's on other stuff I don't actually work on for money
[23:54:53] <xeno> lazar: a few times when I wanted something done too though (when it was something I couldn't justify working on in paid time) - but not often
