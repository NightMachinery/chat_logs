[02:44:35] <hinewuser> i do the ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars command and nothing shows up
[02:44:52] <hinewuser> but in the boot options in the bios theres two things to choose from, legacy boot and uefi

[03:04:58] <sn1tch3r> @hinewuser no problem! Let me know if it works :D
[03:05:58] <haicen> i am having some issues trying to get wireguard configured. i have wireguad working, and i am able to ping the host, however i am unable to get forwarding configured to use wireguard as a tunnel for http/s traffic. i'm sure the issue is iptables routing, but i cannot figure out what the issue is
[03:09:00] <sn1tch3r> dumb question, but is the package forwarding enabled?
[03:09:15] <mingdao> haicen: If you don't get an answer here, you might try #wireguard
[03:10:33] <haicen> i assume you meant packet forwarding, and yes, i set sysctl to allow ipv4 and ipv6 forwarding
[03:10:34] <sn1tch3r> check # sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
[03:10:43] <sn1tch3r> oh, right

[05:59:54] <Nact> Hi, I'm using uefiboot and even though the boot entry specify several kernel parameters, linux boot with only root=... rw initrd=\initramfs-linux.img. Don't see any error anywhere.
[06:00:28] <MacGyver> iqqdq: Short answer is yes.
[06:00:52] <MacGyver> iqqdq: If you want a long answer with possible caveats you'll have to describe what you want to do in more detail.
[06:00:57] <Nact> is there something I should check?
[06:01:15] <sheep> are you sure yuou have the right boot entry?
[06:02:02] <Nact> sheep: it's what uefibootmgr -v list at least
[06:02:29] <iqqdq> im looking at the dd method, but what i want to do is literally `doas cat /de/sdb > backupfile` then when I want to go back (inside the livecd): `cat backupfile > /dev/sdb`
[06:03:16] <Nact> sheep: if there is an error in the boot entry, would it boot with default parameters or just not boot at all?
[06:03:46] <sheep> the firmware doesn't have any concept of default parameters
[06:04:06] <sheep> do you have other boot entries?
[06:04:10] <Nact> sheep: yes but it passes them to linux
[06:04:32] <sheep> is one of those entries another bootloader?
[06:04:48] <Nact> sheep: only that one and DVD drive network interface etc which clearly wouldn't work
[06:04:56] <MacGyver> iqqdq: That'll work.
[06:04:58] <Nact> sheep: no
[06:05:13] <sheep> do the boot paramaters in efibootmgr -v change after you reboot?
[06:05:31] <iqqdq> MacGyver: ill give it a go
[06:05:57] <Nact> sheep: no, but I remember they did several month ago when I first tried to solve this

[06:42:30] <sebz> Anyone have a clue? I'm not entirely sure how I can set the audio device RuneLite uses. AFAIK there's no setting to do so.

[10:55:24] <ishan> Heyy, In a dual boot setup with arch(refind) and windows 10, Is it advisable to have 2 /boot partitions? Since major windows updates override the default bootloader and remove refind boot entries from uefi bioes 
[10:55:54] <ishan> I have only ever kept a single /boot partition and readd refind entry with `bcdedit` in windows 
[10:56:13] <ishan> but now I have been called _dumb_ for doing that and not keeping 2 separate partitions for windows and linux
[10:56:26] <NetSysFire> did you check the dualboot with windows wiki page?
[10:56:49] <NetSysFire> also anyone who called you dumb *in here* violated the code of conduct
[10:57:17] <ishan> NetSysFire: No one here did that.. It happened somewhere else.. I am just asking here to weight the pros/cons of the two approach. (also reading the wiki) 
[10:57:39] <NetSysFire> ah, be careful around unofficial communities. some of them are pretty hazardous

[20:03:39] <icar> How could I find which process is generating those messages?

[20:04:12] <sensille> is the 4586 always the same?
[20:04:19] <icar> Yes
[20:04:23] <MrElendig> it literally says the process name and pid
[20:04:24] <sensille> that's the process id
[20:04:42] <MrElendig> journalctl also has custom and more verbose options

[21:52:44] <thrice> odirf: corporate (America, at least) too
[21:52:57] <Foxboron> Luci: these are sources and misc things which we need to retain on our infra because of different upstream issues
[21:53:07] *** Parts: conr (~conr@user/conr) ()
[21:53:08] <Foxboron> e.g old tarballs being removed when new ones are released and so on

[21:53:26] <Luci> Foxboron: Sounds like I only want "pool" for just a pacman mirror, right?
[21:53:44] <Foxboron> Luci: the mandatory part, yes.
[21:53:55] <Luci> Foxboron: Nice, thanks.
[21:53:58] <Foxboron> nps!
[21:54:01] <lantech19446> Foxboron: rebooting will update the kernel?
[21:54:13] <odirf> thrice: Sounds not good. I hope that change one day. What's bad about Matrix?
[21:54:23] <Betal> kevr: should we look "virt" or "res" RAM usage for this 1GB?
[21:54:28] <Luci> Foxboron: Since "repositories" is only ~100 MB I will mirror that too.
[21:55:00] <Foxboron> Luci: yes
[21:55:03] <Foxboron> err, lantech19446*
[21:55:25] <thrice> odirf: I'm not in IT, but at least where I work, Teams does a lot of crap.  Chats (group & individuals), channels with pretty solid (IMO) posting options - nice pics, videos, whatever.   But it goes too far, as it's basically a sharepoint front end, too, so gets bloated with people's files
[21:55:55] <thrice> I liked teams when it first launched, but it's going down the "Outlook" path of trying to do too much
[21:56:09] <Luci> Foxboron: So, what's the upstream mirror from Arch Linux? If I understood correctly, I should rather use some other public mirror?
[21:56:25] <Luci> I mean to make a local mirror.
[21:56:31] <Foxboron> Luci: are you setting up a new public mirror?
[21:56:42] <Luci> Foxboron: No, in-house.
[21:56:43] <odirf> Teams is - more or less - in point of features very nice. But the privacy is shit, as with all products from Microsoft.

[21:57:11] <odirf> And for me it's really cumbersome to use
[21:57:16] <Foxboron> Luci: then you won't get access to the "upstream mirror", preferably use a tier 3 mirror since they see less use then tier 2, but tier 2 is fine as well
[21:57:39] <Luci> I only see Tier 1 and Tier 2 on my linked Wiki article.
[21:57:45] <thrice> I DO like MS's new approach of having stuff on the web.  I can log in to my work teams app via. my linux laptop, which is kind of cool
[21:58:10] <Luci> Tier 3 doesn't seem to exist at all: https://archlinux.org/mirrors/tier/3/
[21:58:22] <Foxboron> Luci: sorry, preferably use tier 2, not tier 1 mirrors
[21:58:58] <Foxboron> tier 3 should be the ones syncing for tier 2... but I forget we don't actually list that at all
[21:59:17] <lantech19446> Foxboron: isn't 5.12.14 the newest kernel?
[21:59:21] <Foxboron> lantech19446: it is
[21:59:26] <lantech19446> that's what i have
[21:59:56] <Foxboron> lantech19446: I didn't say otherwise, but when you get the new kernel you need to reboot, else you see the mentioned error.
[22:00:10] <Luci> Foxboron: Just out of interest, what's the main difference of Tier 1 and 2? I don't see mandatory differences.
[22:00:12] <odirf> thrice: Teams is using Electron (Chromium), so it's not special that Microsoft adds the support for Linux distributions.
[22:00:21] <NetSysFire> lantech19446: see the note here https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel_module#Manual_module_handling
[22:00:22] <phrik> Title: Kernel module - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[22:00:30] <Foxboron> Luci: tier 1 syncs from tier 0, tier 2 syncs from tier 1. 
[22:00:31] <lantech19446> Foxboron: i didn't just install it that's what came with my install from june 1
[22:00:47] <Foxboron> Luci: new public mirrors can sync from tier 1, but we encourage private mirrors to sync from tier 2.
[22:00:47] <Luci> Foxboron: Tier 0 is Arch Linux direct I assume.
[22:00:48] <thrice> odirf: well, I mean, all MS apps have that capability.  I can open my work's "Word" app via. chromium on linux
[22:00:50] <Foxboron> Luci: yep
[22:01:18] <odirf> Ah. Ok
[22:01:33] <Luci> Foxboron: So, Tier 1 looks like "really minimum requirements" where Tier 2 must fit all requirements for become some more major mirror?
[22:01:49] <odirf> Yeah, that's really cool. But Teams in GTK would be amazing anyway.
[22:01:52] <thrice> but you're right, the fact that there is a "teams" client isn't special.  But the web instance also works without the app
[22:01:59] <Foxboron> Luci: other way around
[22:02:09] <Luci> Foxboron: Ah, okay. Thank you.
[22:02:14] <Foxboron> Luci: nps!

[23:52:13] <th0rne> thrice❱ Rebooting fixed it. :)
[23:52:24] <th0rne> But yeah, I did remove python-magic, that didn't help.
[23:52:35] <th0rne> Also yes, I do pacman -Syu
[23:52:40] <th0rne> Err.
[23:52:46] <th0rne> I do pacman -Syu like every day.

[23:53:15] <Snyp> ahem.. yay -Syu is where it's at.
[23:54:04] <rugan> why not simply `yay`
[23:54:49] <Snyp> didn't know that >_>
[23:55:07] <th0rne> I'm not a degenerate like you guys.
[23:55:49] <Snyp> --editmenu since you gotta add that -j4 to makefiles :smirk: 
[23:56:28] <th0rne> I mean I have that fzf thing, so in reality I do ^r and write 'syu' and hit enter.

[23:58:01] <Snyp> history-search-backward <-- in .inputrc is better imo
