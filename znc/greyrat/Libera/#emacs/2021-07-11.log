[00:00:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Unless region beginning & end are in the same buffer as (buffer-name), you might get weird results with REPLACE argument.

[00:05:28] <bpalmer> (defun json-format (start end &optional bool) (interactive "r") (shell-command-on-region start end (if bool "jq -jc" "jq -j") nil t))  is how I would have written it, by the way , but that won't address jq's output
[00:06:10] <bpalmer> notice that it uses interactive to provide the region bounds, and nil for the buffer
[00:06:51] <bpalmer> that could also be (interactive "rP"), so that you can use a prefix arg to handle the 'bool' flag
[00:08:32] <stavros> that's great stuff, thank you!
[00:09:21] <stavros> Sorry to monopolize, but another thing I would appreciate help with is that my work's laptop does not allow connecting to melpa (only elpa), and also I cannot install system-wide software as I don't have sudo. Is there any other way to install packages missing from elpa e.g. helm?
[00:10:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> stavros: Maintain local git repository clones and add them to your load path.
[00:10:16] <bpalmer> you can install elisp manually (see ,,install )), or use a system like borg or straight
[00:10:17] <fsbot> install: [0/5] To install a <file>.el, save it to e.g. ~/elisp
[00:10:18] <fsbot> [1] add to the beginning of ~/.emacs: (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp")

[00:10:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> use-package has some goodies for helping my method. I use them as submodules of a master repository.

[00:13:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> stavros: As for installing software, adding things to your $PATH and perhaps building with --prefix for install would be of use.

[00:45:47] <contrapunctus> So I've got a package whose 4 entry commands create buffers derived from tabulated-list-mode.

[06:41:43] <contrapunctus> One where modifiers can be pressed with the thumbs, without leaving the home position.
[06:42:07] <YoungPotato> A while ago I purchased the Xbows keyboard that Xah also has on his website (http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_best_keyboard.html)

[06:53:55] <YoungPotato> After two years they still had not. Even though I asked them for it multiple times.

[13:21:52] <NinKenDo> Hey guys, I'm unsure if this is a bug, but I found something consider undesirable behaviour that would potentially allow someone to gain root shell on an unattended terminal with no password, but I'm unsure how to report it, it seems sending it to the bug tracker would be inappropriate, but I'm not sure
[13:22:09] <yeti> it even is available on an openwrt without luci (and therefor without lua) and so a nice alternative to only having sh
[13:22:53] <yeti> NinKenDo: emacs related?
[13:23:22] <NinKenDo> yeah, you gain eshell session as sudo/root
[13:24:14] <NinKenDo> without password check
[13:25:47] <wasamasa> the usual protocol for this is to ask on the official channels how to report security issues
[13:25:48] <NinKenDo> oh actually you can also get shell mode session as root fwiw
[13:26:05] <wasamasa> then proceed by whatever it is they tell you
[13:26:47] <wasamasa> my bet though is that you're person #48729 to find out that sudo isn't a security barrier
[13:27:43] <NinKenDo> I'm fairly certain I'm not the first person to discover this
[13:27:45] <wasamasa> there's a bunch of scripts that wait for sudo to remember the password, then use that tty session

[13:34:53] <wasamasa> as opposed to the latest big sudo bug where you didn't even need to be a sudoer to gain privileges
[13:36:13] <NinKenDo> yeah I mean, sudo is it's own security nightmare in and of itself, however I think this specific issue is on Emacs' end
[13:36:28] <NinKenDo> maybe I will try asking on the mailing list where exactly I should send it

[13:38:29] <twb> NinKenDo: sorry I don't know offhand what that is
[13:38:44] <twb> NinKenDo: I don't think the debbugs tracker we use supports "classified" tickets
[13:38:47] <wasamasa> GNU projects typically discuss anything touchy in private
[13:39:16] <wasamasa> you have to go that indirection to get access to that private mailing list or whatever they use
[13:39:43] <wasamasa> it's private, so the contact details aren't publicly advertised
[13:39:55] <NinKenDo> oh I see, so by "official channels" you meant IRC channel? I'll try there, thanks

[16:32:56] <bewees> hmm, maybe I use emacs wrongly, would be curious to learn about the use case :-)
[16:33:34] <bremner> for example, the major mode of a buffer is pretty important information.
[16:33:41] <famubu> Hi. I'm on emacs 25.2.2 (the default one in ubuntu 18.04). Emacs crashes whenever I work with a text file containing Kannada script for a prolonged interval time (and sometimes instantly) with what appears to be a segmentation fault. I found a link at https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/PROBLEMS which mentioned this problem. Has this problem been fixed in the newer emacs? Or do we still 
[16:33:47] <famubu> use a work-around? (Just curious (: )
[16:35:30] <bewees> I know in what mode I'm in when I look at the extension of the file name. and if I need to switch modes I just use M-x :-)

[16:36:42] <bremner> see, I'm not going to spend time going through 25 reasons why a modeline is useful with you. 
[16:37:13] <bremner> you are free not to use one; make sure you specify that when asking for help
[16:37:30] <irek> bewees: for example while using irc clients you will get notifications of new messages in mode-line
[16:38:02] <irek> bewees: there is a way to use echo are for displaying some information while nothing else is shown in echo area
[16:38:20] <bewees> Maybe I need to use emacs longer until I find out myself a use case - showing the time was the first I noticed, but maybe there's a workaround or show only a small corner mode line with the time not stretching 100% width
[16:38:57] <siraben> famubu: that version is quite old, we're on 27.2 now so it may be resolved

[16:44:32] <siraben> bewees: it's one of the features you'll mostly use passively, so there's no harm in installing a custom modeline

[22:10:39] <RunLevelRobot> Hey guys I am using desktop-save-mode 1 in my config. The problem I am having is all my org files are open when launching emacs. Even though I have closed them all. Any way to stop this?

[22:11:19] <bpalmer> RunLevelRobot: how did you close them?
[22:11:29] <RunLevelRobot> C-x k
[22:11:43] <RunLevelRobot> i also have default-directory set
[22:11:47] <RunLevelRobot> could that be it?
[22:11:55] <bpalmer> RunLevelRobot: ok, just to make sure, C-x C-b shows they're not around; you then quit and start it again; and they're back?
[22:12:15] <bpalmer> RunLevelRobot: default-directory just affects where emacs defaults to looking for files you open or save
[22:12:39] <RunLevelRobot> ok let me try that

[23:59:08] <Wafficus> is it possible to just expose the link in elfeed itself so I can just copy and paste it into EWW instead?
