[00:01:38] <kepstin> aphysically: if you run with "-v verbose" you should get some information from the filter graph setup about negotiation and auto-inserted scale (conversion) filters.
[00:01:38] <JEEB> there's a function that dumps the filter chain out

[00:02:23] <aphysically> oh, I didn't realize there was a function to dump the filter chain; I was looking for one unsuccessfully to try to get something easier than verbose mode
[00:02:36] <aphysically> (which is what I was doing before)
[00:02:40] *** Joins: nillyhan (~67af8209@user/nillyhan)
[00:04:04] <JEEB> avfilter_graph_dump is what works after you've avfilter_graph_config has been called (the string-based filter chain creation stuff might do this for you within whatever function that utilizes)
[00:04:30] <aphysically> ah, from the API :P....I will move to the API eventually
[00:04:32] <aphysically> :D
[00:05:00] <JEEB> you can patch ffmpeg.c relatively simply with it. I'm pretty sure there even was a patch set for it for at some point, no idea where it went if anywhere
[00:05:56] <JEEB> one thing I'm pretty sure ffmpeg.c has already an option for is to disable auto-scale filter additions
[00:06:16] <JEEB> avfilter_graph_set_auto_convert with AVFILTER_AUTO_CONVERT_NONE
[00:06:25] <JEEB> yup
[00:06:43] <aphysically> I will search the mailing list for it maybe. Sometimes following the verbose output can be a little difficult when I'm just trying to verify a filter graph behavior (and it's something that comes up repeatedly it seems)
[00:06:45] <JEEB> auto_conversion_filters
[00:07:01] <JEEB> which is on by default and then if you set that off it disables auto-insertion
[00:07:48] <aphysically> yeah, I think I experimented with that to try to catch errors in my filter graph by forcing me to do it manually, but iirc I wasn't able to figure out how to introspect the file enough with ffprobe to get what I needed to avoid auto conversion filters for all picsub formats
[00:07:55] <aphysically> at least that's  my recollection, I think I last experimented with this a year ago
[00:08:01] <aphysically> probably worth revisiting

[02:29:28] <aphysically> umm, I'll look. I need to look into the boxdumper tool usage first (I think I found it)
[02:30:05] <aphysically> I haven't found any mov_text files in mp4 without the problem, but maybe it's just that the problematic ones are really common since I'm not sure the exact underlying issue ( https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/7855 )

[02:49:48] <aphysically> let's download that sample
[02:51:21] <JEEB> i'd expect putting srt/ass re-encoded as mov_text into mp4 shouls work
[02:51:39] <JEEB> since movenc has so much stuff trting to handle it right :p
[02:51:57] <JEEB> since tracks need to be continuous etc
[02:53:02] <JEEB> do you know know in the boxdump which track is the subs? modern ffmpeg with verbose log level should output it as the stream id after the stream index, in brackets
[02:53:51] <aphysically> I have files starting with mov_text that I'm trying to get the subtitles from
[02:53:55] <JEEB> i guess 3 since there's only 1,2,3
[02:54:27] <aphysically> I can confirm https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/6341 hasn't regressed, so it turns out it's just really common to have mov_text in the wild that are like the other bug, or there's additional bugs as well

[02:55:18] <aphysically> I'll try

[02:56:07] <aphysically> I think that's right; ticket 6341 is doing it by converting to movenc using ffmpeg first, and that didn't regress/wasn't broken when I just tested it
[02:56:26] <aphysically> converting using movenc*
[02:58:29] <JEEB> so for a short primer, see track 3 in that boxdump.
[02:58:38] <JEEB> it seems to have two samples

[03:00:31] <aphysically> size 2? what's the line count
[03:00:34] <JEEB> second is 10 bytes and starts from 5s since the padding one has a delta of 5000
[03:00:35] <aphysically> line number I mean

[03:59:56] <rubynt> Hello, I have a problem with the preset option, I started working on adding an option to only recording on selected screen if we use the follow mouse. After I compiled ffmpeg it throws me an error if i try to use the -preset ultrafast option.
[04:00:57] <rubynt> did i compileit wrong?
[04:01:45] <BtbN> the x264 preset has absolutely nothing to do with how you capture your screen. So what you're describing makes no sense.
[04:04:59] <rubynt> It says Unrecognized option 'preset'.
[04:05:17] <BtbN> Did you pass it as input option?
[04:07:54] <rubynt> i ran this ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 600x475 -framerate 60 -follow_mouse centered -thread_queue_size 512 -i :0.0 -threads 4 -f pulse -i 1 -ac 1 -preset ultrafast output.mkv
[04:08:47] <another|> did you compile with libx264?
[04:09:06] <another|> what codec is it choosing? which encoder?
[04:12:42] <BtbN> you're not telling it to use libx264, so whatever default encoder it picked probably just doesn't understand "-preset"
[04:13:24] <another|> fallback is mpeg4

[08:18:22] <jafa> HE-AACv2 - it is possible to have PS without SBR correct? In that situation is 1024 samples (like AAC-LC) or 2048 samples (like SBR) in the frame?
[08:23:10] <jafa> found a few posts saying PS without SBR isn't possible
[08:25:05] <jafa> but I found a spec with a table suggesting options with and without SBR with v2

[11:06:12] <JEEB> aphysically: mpv decodes the subtitle of course in addition to demux, I think ffprobe can show you the decoded AVSubtitle fields
[11:06:41] <JEEB> I didn't see anything special in mpv's subtitle handling code when I added stuff like moving it off the timestamps-included output mode as well as integrating the show-until-next duration field
[11:07:09] <aphysically> huh, so maybe it just avoids the bug by some accidental quirk
[11:07:11] <JEEB> so what ffprobe should output with -show_frames should more or less be what mpv is also dealing with
[11:07:26] <JEEB> -show_packets was just demux
[11:07:29] <aphysically> I will look in a little bit
[11:07:39] <JEEB> nah, there were no real quirks  when I looked at the code :D
[11:07:40] <aphysically> (currently getting ready for bed myself)
[11:07:51] *** Quits: zmt00 (~zmt00@user/zmt00) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[11:08:08] <JEEB> my guess is: AVPacket's duration and AVSubtitle's stuff differ
[11:09:34] <aphysically> I went ahead and did it before off to brush teeth: https://bpa.st/7BTQ
[11:10:10] <JEEB> lol
[11:10:14] *** Joins: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter)
[11:10:25] <JEEB> ok, so there is no real reason how mpv would not be affected
[11:10:42] <aphysically> well, this is my compiled ffmpeg; I will try mys ystem ffmpeg to be absolutely certain
[11:11:53] <aphysically> https://bpa.st/RLVQ -> my system ffmpeg that mpv is using (4.4.1 currently), the prior pastes were with ffmpeg master
[11:11:57] <aphysically> so still the same
[11:12:07] <aphysically> (and therefore still a mystery why mpv isn't affected)
[11:12:17] <aphysically> okay brb now
[11:14:16] <JEEB> anyways if you want to verify that mpv gets those values as well, `sub/sd_lavc.c::decode` and after avcodec_decode_subtitle2 & the return code and got_sub check you should be able to basically log the fields of the received AVSubtitle
[11:15:23] <JEEB> my expectation: it gets the exact same values.
[11:16:08] <galad> is this about the last subtitle not going away?
[11:16:31] <aphysically> yes
[11:16:34] <JEEB> and that it stops showing the subtitles might have to do with something like looking it against the AVStream's exposed duration if such is available. but I have not seen any extra code like that in mpv's subtitle rendering :P
[11:16:51] <JEEB> granted, I've mostly focused on subtitle decode which I did partially rework
[11:16:57] <galad> yes probably mpv uses the duration
[11:17:17] <aphysically> it happens in _all_ the sames I have (presumably because they're all made in the same or similar programs that hit the bug, because mov_text made with ffmpeg don't have the problem)
[11:17:18] <galad> and something in FFmpeg just waits for the next subs
[11:17:22] <aphysically> s/sames/samples/
[11:17:39] <galad> and ignore the duration
[11:17:41] <aphysically> but for testing I'm using the sample attached to this bug because it's small adn convenient and looked like the ones I'm finding in the wild: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/7855
[11:18:11] <aphysically> JEEB: yes i'll need to compile mpv separately from my system-compiled one for convenient for adding debug bits
[11:18:40] <JEEB> galad: this specific case is pretty obvious. the demuxer is for some reason instead of trusting stts, extending it to the media duration (I expect something like that is happening) :P
[11:18:42] <aphysically> luckily this is usually trivial in gentoo (it's really super convenient to just have almost all the usual dev dependencies installed already always)
[11:19:19] <JEEB> this is not a fix_sub_duration issue etc
[11:19:25] <galad> JEEB: yup, and I wrote one such muxer hat doesn't write an empty last packet, so every file it wrote expose this FFmpeg bug ahah
[11:19:30] <galad> *that
[11:19:48] <JEEB> did you check that 3GPP timed text spec lets you do that?
[11:20:00] <JEEB> I haven't had time to check that
[11:20:03] <JEEB> for tx3g
[11:20:14] <galad> maybe I did 10 years ago
[11:20:15] <JEEB> but that would be on my list of things to check for after $dayjob
[11:20:58] <aphysically> I'll compile mpv tomorrow morning and look at it to sanity check
[11:21:05] <JEEB> basically movenc is very adamant on writing that final sample
[11:21:15] <JEEB> so I've also thought of poking wbs on why
[11:21:20] <JEEB> since IIRC he was the original author of that writing
[11:21:47] <JEEB> so yea, two bits: 3GPP timed text spec and poking wbs :P
[11:21:51] <galad> or maybe I was just expecting demuxers to honour the stts durations
[11:22:13] <aphysically> I've been learning enough to get into open source a bit :^); I merged my first 3 commits into cpython (and none of them were documentation or spelling ;) )
[11:22:21] <JEEB> I kinda expect that as well, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was something fun in the spec :P
[11:22:32] <JEEB> since the stts seems clear enough
[11:22:39] <galad> anyway, it worked in quicktime, and that was my goal
[11:22:54] <JEEB> and of course if the specs don't say anything about it, then utilizing stts should be the thing to do :P
[11:24:02] <aphysically> I sleep now; thanks I'll compile mpv tomorrow and poke at it to see if I can't at least answer why it isn't broken

[18:36:41] <roxlu> hi, when I have a fat.h264 file with only I-frames, is it possible to use ffmpeg to extract the I-frames into separate .h264 files?
[18:38:27] *** Joins: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter)
[18:38:30] <OTIBA[m]1> What do you mean?
[18:38:33] <BtbN> I mean, just -c copy into a new file, with a time limit and fps so it grabs one frame?
[18:38:35] <BtbN> But... why?
[18:38:42] <BtbN> Don't use raw h264 files, they're bad
[18:39:59] <roxlu> Every nal in a .h264 I have is a I-frame and I want to extract them into separate files. I'm working on a test and this would make it easy to load separate frames.
