[20:21:53] <Gnuman> acagastya, it would be nice to use it in regular English, rather than have to say "exclusive or" or explain what type of "or" we mean. I initially thought it was a typo, too, but then I realized X is nowhere near O, so it must be intentional.

[20:22:40] <ikke> But is it appropriate in the context of: "Should I do X or should I do Y?
[20:23:20] <feinedsquirrel> Oh, the call to "go build" has something inside of it that is (probably) calling some dep from npm, then? I'll have to look and see if I can install husky prior to the call to "go build". icholy: I installed go from the official arch repos with "pacman -S go"
[20:23:48] <ikke> feinedsquirrel: fyi: husky is most likely not required, and more likely to be a nuisance
[20:24:02] <icholy> feinedsquirrel: I doubt that. `go build` allowing arbitrary code execution would be a vulnerability
[20:24:04] <ikke> especially in the context of building packages
[20:28:32] <feinedsquirrel> I'm new to go and nodejs/npm, not familiar with "notorious" packages/behavior, as this sounds like it might be. Good point about the security context. I'll contact the devs and find out more, maybe I can submit a pull request to just remove it. I don't think it is anything specific to my PKGBUILD, as my build() function is a simple copy from the developers "manual install" instructions.
[20:29:38] <feinedsquirrel> Oh, I missed the suggestion to try "go get ." I'll give that a shot first
[20:30:24] <ikke> feinedsquirrel: husky is not a go package
[20:30:30] <ikke> so I don't see how that would fix it
[20:31:30] <feinedsquirrel> Ah, I wondered that, but thought maybe you were suggesting something in getting the go packages necessary might trigger the husky install. Thanks for the clarification.
