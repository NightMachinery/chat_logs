[05:21:11] <shibboleth> how are we looking with re to openvpn acceleration for 2.4?
[05:22:07] <shibboleth> apparently openvpn made a new client for openvpn 3 to avoid the major overhead of being both user-and-kernel-space
[05:22:22] <BtbN> "openvpn acceleration"?
[05:24:17] <shibboleth> yeah, atm there's a major overhead/cost due to being both userland and kernelspace
[05:24:29] <shibboleth> compared to say, wireguard
[05:24:30] <BtbN> OpenVPN is a userland application.
[05:24:38] <BtbN> It's not a kernel module
[05:24:47] <shibboleth> yes, and openvpn were gonna make a kernel module to alleviate this
[05:25:01] <BtbN> And the major overhead of a VPN is the crypto CPU load. Which does not magically get faster when done in kernel space

Currently, the module supports the OpenVPN3 open beta Linux client and the experimental builds of the OpenVPN server for Linux. A similar module ovpn-dco-win is also being developed for the Windows kernel.

[05:35:02] <shibboleth> testing what?
[05:35:11] <ke4nhw> I am having some problems with my openvpn starting. I am using the same config I used before, the same service file I created before, and the same files (which someone here said I could literally copy into the /etc/openvpn directory from my backups) as before. It worked before (on another system). This is a new install of Centos 7 <cont>
[05:35:16] <shibboleth> the kernel module? without a 2.6 client?
[05:35:27] <shibboleth> the kernel module? without a 2.6 client/server?
[05:35:38] <ke4nhw> and 'systemctl enable vpnsvr.service' works fine, but systemctl start vpnsvr.service fails.

[05:36:47] <plaisthos> shibboleth: there are instruction how to use and test ovpn-dco
[05:37:05] <plaisthos> shibboleth: testing from other people would help to acclerate a 2.6 release
[05:38:03] <shibboleth> hmmm
[05:42:05] <ke4nhw> Any help would be greatly appreciated
[05:58:42] <shibboleth> anyone asked if the openwrt devs will be open to testing it?
[06:10:24] <ke4nhw> Okay, nvm, I was able to solve the problem (this one was wierd and a pain to fix) and am running, and will start distributing keys immediately.
[06:14:23] <BtbN> shibboleth, don't expect that to make it magically faster, like I said.
[06:14:45] <BtbN> OpenVPN is almost always CPU bound. So only situation saving a few context switches would make a massive difference is when juggling a crapton of clients.
[06:15:04] <BtbN> For single-client connection performance, there will be no notable difference

[17:14:41] <mzar> yes, it's slow
[17:14:56] <mzar> perhaps DCO will be adapted to more OSes
[17:15:10] <mzar> but someone has to pay for commiters' tome
[17:15:11] <mzar> time
[17:16:44] <mzar> the most valuable features are: 1. ease of use due to certificates, 2. logging support
[17:23:12] <ordex> mzar: there was interest from the BSD community, but nothing has happened so far
[17:33:19] <mzar> is DCO in usable state for Linux ?
[17:39:02] <ordex> yes
[17:39:18] <ordex> lots of people are using it with OpenVPN3-Linux
[17:39:39] <ordex> it is still not considered "stable" as we are hunting some bugs here and there, but most people haven't reported any issue ina while
[17:39:58] <ordex> more testers are of course welcome :)
[17:40:47] <mzar> nice, I am eagerly waiting to see this in FreeBSD... maybe at some point ;)
[17:41:27] <ordex> hehe
[17:41:35] <ordex> I hope to see it soon too
[17:41:50] <ordex> maybe once 2.6 is released, and dco gets more widespread on linux, the bsd people will get attracted again
[17:41:51] <mzar> I have been using OpenVPN with FreeBSD since ~2005, so will wait ;) 
[17:41:57] <ordex> :D
[17:42:33] <plaisthos> mzar: yeah, we had some interest from people implementing this but never heard anything back from them
[17:42:51] <mzar> yes, someone has to sponsor coder's work, maybe PFSense or similiar project will
[17:42:57] <ordex> dazo: didn't you have a script to update all copyright years in the repo?
[17:43:03] <ordex> ops wrong channel
[17:44:20] <plaisthos> I might get around implementing kqueue in OpenVPN in the future
[17:44:37] <plaisthos> but a FreeBSD kernel module is not on my agenda.
[17:45:00] <plaisthos> I am happy to help with questions and doing the user space part for FreeBSD
[17:45:54] <ordex> my hope is that userspace will require little adjustment
[17:46:03] <ordex> anyway, for the future..
[17:46:39] <mzar> ha... thank you, but I am neither committer, nor even real C programmer
[17:47:02] <ordex> mzar: perfect, you could be the investor!
[17:47:04] <ordex> :D
[17:48:40] <mzar> yes, the position of sponsor would be the only choice in this case ;P
[17:49:07] <plaisthos> ordex: yeah but we probably need a dco_freebsd.c that uses route link or something FreeBSD specific
[17:49:37] <ordex> yup yup. I Wanted to say that generic userspace code will hopefully not require many changes
[17:49:49] <ordex> I definitely expect a freebsd specific file to handle the API
[17:50:11] <ordex> that's the beauty of our internel API *_*
