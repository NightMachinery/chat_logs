[00:09:54] <Activ8> whooooooooooosh
[00:10:05] <fritzwastaken> Kelvin (K), base unit of thermodynamic temperature measurement in the International System of Units (SI). ... The difference between the freezing and boiling points of water is 100 degrees in both the Kelvin and Celsius scales; thus, the Kelvin degree has the same magnitude as the Celsius degree.

O365:  I've heard they will be doing away with basic auth for POP + IMAP in 2022, is this true?  currently the inboxes they are forwarded to (Gmail) have a way to "Send As..." by just putting in the SMTP server + port + login pw, but I guess that will break once that happens?

[03:19:46] <Activ8> I love small businesses we have like businesses with 5 staff up to 100 ha ha it's too easy to support 
[03:20:05] <Activ8> don't make as much money as large enterprises though but all is well we don't want to make too much money.

[03:20:35] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> Low pay and lack of learning were my biggest issues
[03:20:43] <bn_work> DevOps is all about moving things to containers leveraging "cloud services", etc. I fear it will push sysadmin roles out eventually

[03:23:56] <Activ8> that's something that probably shouldn't go in the cloud right now

[03:24:55] <estranger> and databricks
[03:24:56] <bn_work> estranger: what people forget is *someone* still has to make the cloud work, but it will probably be techs just keeping servers running in DCs and everything in containers now (for better or worse)

[03:51:01] <Activ8> there's an amazon operator delivery place just opened near us, 1500 jobs created massive warehouse 
[03:51:04] <corn266> the job market is a bunch of goddamn hippos if you have a clearance
[03:51:08] <Activ8> for around here that is ha
[03:51:20] <corn266> and if you got one then you're the only source of water
[03:51:44] <bn_work> it's an evil system that is just designed to have such a ridiculously complicated nickel-and-dime business model that trap you in overages unless you buy more of their product to "protect" yourself from it
[03:51:52] <catbeard> also remember that spacex is hiring
[03:52:03] <catbeard> check the discord for the recent job posts
[03:52:08] <corn266> i was just told that if i had a clearance i'd have weekly blowjobs company paid
[03:52:15] <catbeard> infosec eng for spacex would be pretty rad
[03:52:25] <corn266> good looking girls too
[03:52:30] <bn_work> I mean what do you expect coming from Amazon, an e-commerce company that just wants to sell you as much junk as possible
[03:52:41] <catbeard> on the government's dime of course, which means taxpayer funded blowjobs
[03:52:49] <corn266> they want in the govt sector bn_work 
[03:52:57] <Activ8> I don't have the money to buy junk
[03:53:05] <corn266> so they have govcloud that _can_ hit TS clearance

[03:55:04] <corn266> who done
[03:55:05] <bn_work> Activ8: then stay away from the AWS monster
[03:55:18] <Activ8> I sell myself short when it comes to advanced posts I don't believe I'm good enough for the more advanced.  A little bit of me doesn't want the responsibility 
[03:55:41] <corn266> grab life by the balls you <word>
[03:56:27] <bn_work> corn266: sounds as evil as the cuckoo bird
[03:56:45] <Activ8> sometimes in life though you step back with what's comfortable, jumping over the bridge can be a little short sighted sometimes and the grass isn't always greener
[03:57:23] <corn266> i was asking who threw a fuss, i guess AWS?
[03:57:53] <corn266> cause that trial got recalled and they're still working on the JEDI contract even if it fucking exists
[03:57:57] <bn_work> corn266: they hijack other birds nest by laying the eggs there and let some dumb other species raise their young, the cuckoo birds have evolved to grow faster and evil-ly push out the eggs of other species
[03:58:09] <corn266> oh fuck
[03:58:16] <corn266> you're talking about actual birds
[03:58:19] <corn266> lmfao

[03:59:52] <bn_work> Activ8: I don't blame you, why I've tried to usually stay away from too much dev work, as you brain will be consumed 24/7 during your off time, vs actually being able to "unplug"
[04:00:34] <Activ8> if I can't unplug I would never want that role, ever no matter how much money was thrown at me
[04:00:57] <bn_work> yep, work-life balance has value
[04:01:06] <Activ8> I have been in roles where I couldn't switch off
[04:01:11] <Activ8> ended up quitting
[04:01:17] * corn266 is a dev
[04:01:24] <bn_work> one of the reasons a buddy of mine just went with "Test Engineer" as a career
[04:01:25] <corn266> i tell my boss to shove it
[04:01:35] <Activ8> I'm a sysop
[04:01:46] <corn266> and i'll send you fuck's my cv if you don't leak it
[04:01:59] <Activ8> I have TS clearence, would never leak anyone
[04:02:02] <bn_work> I think I will be eventually forced into the financial sector, I'm not looking forward to it
[04:02:07] <Activ8> I have TS clearence, would never leak anyone's info.
[04:02:13] <corn266> see who would do that
[04:02:19] <corn266> go on the internet and lie?
[04:02:21] <bn_work> such companies tend to be led by terrible personalities
[04:02:37] <bn_work> at least it will be a consistent environment though
[04:02:43] <bn_work> (from the tech side)
[04:02:46] <corn266> i applied for a job with someone in here
[04:02:50] <Activ8> I have been in really poison work places
[04:03:06] <corn266> i am _actually_ pissed off by how easy the interview process and questions were
[04:03:12] <bn_work> Activ8: fin-tech?
[04:03:21] <Activ8> one support company had tickets closed per day but there wasn't enough tickets coming in so people where fighting over the ticket closures to get bonuses
[04:03:31] <Activ8> fucking would i fuck work in such a poison place again
[04:03:41] <corn266> gross
[04:03:48] <Activ8> I got up told the boss to fuck off n sort the company out n left
[04:03:52] <corn266> bunch of feral wolves fighting over some meat
[04:04:04] <Activ8> real poison
[04:04:11] <corn266> good on you if that happened
[04:04:16] <corn266> not saying it did or didn't
[04:04:26] <corn266> that's toxic as fuck
[04:04:46] <Activ8> I did, and the reason I did was because I could see what was happening.  Toxic work places isn't nice and it damages more people than fixes
[04:05:11] <Activ8> I'm from a place of ethic where health matters
[04:05:23] <bn_work> I don't know if fin-tech (with penny-pinching personalities) or MSP would be a worse industry, I feel like healthcare would tend to have more "understanding" personalities, but maybe I'd end up drowning in HIPAA law-compliance BS
[04:06:17] <bn_work> Activ8:  yuck, sounds like overly focusing on metrics vs customer
[04:06:22] <Activ8> a SMB MSP is great, not so much if the company has a sales department who don't give a fuck lol
[04:07:06] <bn_work> Activ8: so you guys are based in the UK?
[04:07:21] <bn_work> sales always overpromises , lol
[04:07:33] <bn_work> it's in their nature, then you have to real the customer back to reality
[04:07:37] <bn_work> reel
[04:07:45] <Activ8> UK based yes bn_work
[04:08:14] <Activ8> I warned the guy I work with to keep the sales guy away from me the first day he lies or overpromises to a customer
[04:08:19] <yuken> ew UK
[04:08:30] <Activ8> ew
[04:08:40] <yuken> We should just nuke that place.

[04:17:24] <bn_work> Activ8:  small companies you get to wear more hats, which is fun for sysop roles IMO.  is the founder still with the company?  I think once they leave things usually go downhill
[04:17:59] <corn266> Activ8 if you listen, then you hear. You can't just hear to listen.
[04:18:01] <Activ8> founder is still here, if he leaves I leave I'm too involved with the company and without him there is no me at present

[04:21:37] <bn_work> I wish there was an easier way to do targeted role searches, instead I just get spammed by recruiter mails.  Job postings are now so bad you never know if posted roles are the primary or just recruiters.  There are some good recruiters and I told one that I worked with once that I'd *pay* to have them find me the ideal role that I want
[04:22:05] <Activ8> I don't listen to recruiters they spammed me for the last time on linked in before I closed my account

[15:12:38] <Hunterkll> since you just diving into the config tree anyway and might as well be using the cli

[15:13:04] <Hunterkll> or maybe they have a switch that can do it i'm not sure about that

[15:14:16] <PrincessZoey> do they still have the regular cloudkey or is it only the $200 one with a HDD in it?
[15:14:52] <Hunterkll> they got a $179 version that doesnt have the hdd
[15:14:59] <Hunterkll> i would NOT get the original
[15:15:00] <ender> APs have ssh interface, but it's not really meant to be used
[15:15:02] <Hunterkll> they tend to overheat and melt 
[15:15:37] <PrincessZoey> a camera pointed at the 3d printer would be nice but we don't need the DVR function
[15:16:31] <Hunterkll> i mean
[15:16:36] <Hunterkll> to be fair, from $179 to $199
[15:16:43] <Hunterkll> it wouldn't really make sense to get the one without the hdd
[15:16:47] <PrincessZoey> yeah
[15:17:17] <PrincessZoey> need to find a reliable way to make the uverse gateway a modem only and do passthrough 
[15:17:34] <PrincessZoey> there's https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/02/19/ip-passthrough-bgw210-700/
[15:20:32] <ender> the annoying thing about G2 cloudkeys is that they require you to create an online account
[15:20:58] <PrincessZoey> eh, that's not the end of the world 
[15:21:20] <PrincessZoey> t-mobile just got hacked so it's not like all my shit isn't already out in the open
[15:21:28] <ender> it wasn't fun figuring that out on an isolated network
[15:22:14] <Hunterkll> if you think the t-mo or AT&T breaches are anything that isn't out there anyway
[15:22:16] <Hunterkll> who cares
[15:22:31] <Hunterkll> shit i'm in ~18 year old breaches lol
[15:22:38] <Hunterkll> from traditional non-online centric companies
[15:23:37] <Hunterkll> t-mo shit doesn't bother me at all - cost of dealing with companies in any capacity these days 
[15:23:45] <Hunterkll> not a matter of if, but when, and how much 
[15:23:52] <PrincessZoey> I'm mostly miffed about my social security number 
[15:23:55] <PrincessZoey> the rest is whatever
[15:23:55] <Hunterkll> t-mo's is so basic bitch it's like "ah, wow, they found it again " 
[15:24:10] <Hunterkll> PrincessZoey: pretty sure with a few details i could have found that anyway before this breach
[15:24:19] <Hunterkll> have yet to fail to find one that i needed for whatever reason before
[15:24:22] <PrincessZoey> yeah well you're a god :P
[15:24:26] <Hunterkll> nawww
[15:24:48] <Hunterkll> you'd probably be a bit miffed about how far that shit spreads
[15:24:57] <Hunterkll> shit was NEVER supposed to be used as an identifier but here we are
[15:25:03] <PrincessZoey> eh it's whatever, and it's not like my credit can get any worse. 
[15:25:39] <PrincessZoey> alright, I'm passing out. it's 6am
[15:30:43] *** Quits: djhankb (~djhankb@208.113.164.68) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[15:58:05] <signalblue> it's funny how people try to protect their IP addresses online lol
[15:58:21] <Activ8> a lot of people spend money to try to protect it
[15:58:25] <Activ8> purchasing vpn's n stuff
[15:59:06] <signalblue> I know and it does them no good
[15:59:16] <estranger> I'm a troll so I rather ppl dos my cloud instance instead of me
[15:59:58] <signalblue> stupid question but how do you change the hostmask address?
[16:00:05] <Activ8> lol
[16:00:16] <Activ8> buy a vpn
[16:00:25] <signalblue> n
[16:00:26] <signalblue> o
[16:00:29] <Activ8> I joke
[16:00:34] <Hunterkll> .... hostmask address?
[16:00:37] <Hunterkll> like reverse DNS?
[16:00:38] <signalblue> estranger has an estranger.net hostmask
[16:00:45] <Hunterkll> call your ISP once you get a static address assignment 
[16:00:49] <Hunterkll> and have a domain set to it 
[16:00:51] <Activ8> referse dns
[16:00:53] <Hunterkll> and then have the RDNS set 
[16:00:58] <estranger> I own the domain and setup reverse and forward dns
[16:01:01] <Hunterkll> or buy a VPS or whatever and set your own RDNS
[16:01:14] <Activ8> I have a rdns set as well
[16:01:16] <signalblue> this reminds me of the dymanic IP conversation we had a few days ago Hunter
[16:01:23] <estranger> I use aws still.. just tell them it's a mail server and you can add rdns
[16:01:29] <Activ8> i get a static ip with a control panel by my isp
[16:01:31] <Hunterkll> signalblue: it's the exact same thing lol basically
[16:01:35] <Hunterkll> dynamic they aren't gonna do it 
[16:01:55] <signalblue> even static they were kinda fazed by the question
[16:02:04] <signalblue> I even called the business tech support line lol
[16:02:14] <Activ8> which isp signalblue
[16:02:17] <signalblue> because I have a commercial line
[16:02:26] <signalblue> and a residential one as well
[16:02:32] <signalblue> Activ8: Verizon FiOS
[16:02:42] <signalblue> Gigabit Fiber lol
[16:02:46] <Activ8> I have a residential and I get RDNS
[16:02:56] <signalblue> on FiOS?
[16:03:01] <Activ8> no
[16:03:05] <signalblue> ah ok
[16:03:13] <Hunterkll> i have a 2-bit like 4 state only cable ISP 
[16:03:17] <Hunterkll> and have a static with RDNS set up
[16:03:18] <Hunterkll> lol
[16:03:30] <Hunterkll> hell i've had the same damn static IP for ~10+ years now i think
[16:03:33] <signalblue> what are the speeds Hunter?
[16:03:51] <signalblue> I've had my static pool for like 15 or so years now
[16:04:12] <Activ8> suprised you don't get rdns with it then since it's static
[16:04:29] <signalblue> i never bothered because it's not a mail server
[16:04:33] <Hunterkll> he proibably just needs to find the right person
[16:04:36] <Hunterkll> in tech support
[16:04:37] <signalblue> i'm sure I could if I call them
[16:04:44] <signalblue> but there is no need for me to
[16:05:02] <Hunterkll> but yes
[16:05:05] <signalblue> Hunterkll: what are the speeds on the cable connection?
[16:05:06] <Hunterkll> that's how you change the hostmask address
[16:05:09] <Hunterkll> that hostmask is the rDNS
[16:05:10] <Hunterkll> lol
[16:05:13] <Activ8> lol
[16:05:16] <signalblue> lol
[16:05:38] <Activ8> "stupid question but how do you change the hostmask address?"
[16:05:53] <Activ8> "but there is no need for me to"
[16:05:54] <Hunterkll> signalblue: like gig down and 30mbit up or something stupid
[16:05:54] <signalblue> I heard at 88gbps time travel is possible
[16:05:54] <Hunterkll> lol
[16:06:10] <Hunterkll> was actually a huge discount to upgrade to the gig plan 
[16:06:20] <signalblue> I bet they sell the gigabit down part and hide the uploads in the footprints
[16:06:24] <Hunterkll> cheaper than our old plan & no data cap so we dropped the $50/mo uncapping charge 
[16:06:25] <Hunterkll> nah
[16:06:42] <Hunterkll> just gotta click 'details' on their site
[16:06:47] <Hunterkll> it flips the card over and says
[16:06:48] <Activ8> only if you doc brown
[16:06:50] <signalblue> ah
[16:06:51] <Hunterkll> up to 500+mbps download
[16:06:54] <Hunterkll> up to 20mbps upload
[16:06:56] <Hunterkll> like that
[16:06:59] <signalblue> yeah
[16:07:21] <Activ8> "I heard at 88gbps time travel is possible" - back to the future - great scott#
[16:07:57] <Activ8> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-77xulkB_U
[16:08:23] <Activ8> 1.21 Gigawatts
[16:08:42] <signalblue> estranger: you should buy estranger.com it's only $5,000
[16:08:46] <Hunterkll> the upload is total bs too lol
[16:08:52] <Hunterkll> but their equipment isn't exactly the best
[16:08:54] <Hunterkll> so eh
[16:08:56] <signalblue> no it's not
[16:09:10] <signalblue> i'm sure you're getting the promised speeds
[16:09:17] <Hunterkll> yep
[16:09:25] <Hunterkll> to the 'i need to upgrade router ' level
[16:09:26] <Hunterkll> xD
[16:09:28] <signalblue> then it's not BS
[16:09:28] <signalblue> you signed up for it
[16:09:34] <Hunterkll> well no
[16:09:36] <Activ8> he must own it to get a rdns, at least my isp when setting a rdns I need to be the owner to point the rdns value to my ip
[16:09:43] <Hunterkll> it's like 20mbit upload even if you have 300/500/1000 
[16:09:51] <Hunterkll> all those levels have the same upload
[16:09:52] <signalblue> oh
[16:10:04] <Hunterkll> i say it's BS in terms of "this is fucking 2021 what the hell"
[16:10:16] <Hunterkll> it's BS in terms of iv'e been actively trying for years to pay comcast to run a line to me level
[16:10:21] <signalblue> tbf I can make do with like 100 up and down
[16:10:31] <Hunterkll> though the comcast bit is mostly due to my need for native IPv6 
[16:10:37] <signalblue> lol
[16:10:38] <Activ8> I currently only have 80/20 atm
[16:10:48] <Hunterkll> almost had it done and signed and ran too 
[16:10:49] <Activ8> no requirements for faster net
[16:10:52] <signalblue> Hunterkll: must be a rural area
[16:10:53] <Hunterkll> till the Title II repeal went th rough 
[16:11:01] <Activ8> I'm on the outskirts of town
[16:11:11] <Hunterkll> signalblue: 1 mile down the road i can get gig symmetrical fios or 2gig comcast 
[16:11:16] <signalblue> but yeah
[16:11:18] <Hunterkll> stupid fucking cable franchise laws
[16:11:27] <Activ8> I'm a little further than 1 mile
[16:11:30] <signalblue> comcast does have ipv6 natively
[16:11:30] <Hunterkll> and verizon denying pole access even though they don't run internet here
[16:11:39] <Hunterkll> yea tech wise comcast is basically #1 
[16:11:43] <Activ8> I'm a small town before the farm yard lol
[16:11:53] <signalblue> not tech support* wise
[16:11:58] <estranger> signalblue lol that's why I have .net
[16:11:58] <Activ8> we are expecting 1000/1000 very soon
[16:12:08] <signalblue> isn't comcast just xfinity?
[16:12:14] <Hunterkll> signalblue: it's all about knowing how to navigate those fuckers
[16:12:14] <Activ8> there's a service coming to this town to have a residential direct fiber to the house
[16:12:29] <Hunterkll> i can punch through any tier-1/2 tech support with ease so it doesn't bother me what their frontline is like
[16:12:35] <signalblue> estranger: you could have gotten estranger.com back in 2003 though
[16:12:38] <Hunterkll> signalblue: xfinity was comcast's bid to 'rebrand' without rebranding 
[16:12:50] <Hunterkll> so they advertise xfinity service without putting the comcasts name on it 
[16:12:51] <estranger> I should have
[16:12:52] <Hunterkll> but it's still comcast
[16:13:09] <signalblue> yeah
[16:13:11] <Hunterkll> I've had comcast internet before comcast bought out the company they were leasing their lines to run on - @Home internet
[16:13:22] <signalblue> and how are they #1 in terms of tech?
[16:13:32] <signalblue> except for ipv6 support
[16:13:39] <Hunterkll> IPv6 rollout, network hardware, head end bandwidth, etc 
[16:13:50] <signalblue> LOL
[16:13:50] <Hunterkll> they're essentially a tier-1 backbone provider at this point
[16:13:56] <signalblue> i said except for ipv6
[16:13:59] <Hunterkll> you have almost straight shot peering to EVERYONE
[16:14:04] <signalblue> and you mention that as the reasons
[16:14:42] <Hunterkll> signalblue: i mean, during the early days, when DHCP-PD support was an issue, A-KO got comcast's IPv6 lead to pressure Juniper to fix bugs in their router's shit (and he had just a residential connection)
[16:14:43] <Hunterkll> like i said
[16:14:48] <Hunterkll> once you punch past through the front line
[16:14:50] <Hunterkll> they're phenominal
[16:15:04] <Hunterkll> meanwhile my ISP is fuckin behind the times tech wise, buuuut their tier-1 is phenominal 
[16:15:15] <Hunterkll> so if i had been able to get comcast to run a line i'd hve kept both 
[16:15:22] <signalblue> their front line SUCKED from like 2000 to like 2014 ish
[16:15:34] <Activ8> most frontlines usually do
[16:15:40] <Hunterkll> I had tier-1 send out a NOC engineer to look at my hardware & collect a NIC from me that was crashing a head end CMTS 
[16:15:56] <Hunterkll> intel NIC with a nonsense MAC address that had all numbers, no A-F in it at all, etc
[16:16:09] <Hunterkll> we figured it out when i was dealing with tier-1 and they had me spoof my MAC address and the CMTS stopped crashing
[16:16:10] <Hunterkll> XD
[16:16:17] <Hunterkll> and my internet started working
[16:16:18] <Hunterkll> hahaha
[16:16:24] <Activ8> sweet
[16:16:55] <Hunterkll> I also remember a call when they asked me which version of windows I was using and i just paused 
[16:17:06] <Hunterkll> and the tech was like "Or Linux or Unix or Mac OS X"
[16:17:38] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> "I'm using temple os"
[16:17:43] <signalblue> that means nothing lol
[16:17:44] <Hunterkll> even their sales people knew what i meant when i asked about port filtering/blocking and maintaining the static/rdns when switching plans 
[16:18:07] <Hunterkll> signalblue: they were also familiar enough to help me with commandline shit to spoof the mac address on the damn BSD commandline 
[16:18:09] <Hunterkll> lol
[16:18:11] *** Joins: oj (~oj@user/oj)
[16:18:14] <signalblue> Hunterkll: if you cannot peer to many people, what would happen?
[16:18:15] <Activ8> not everyone on front line gets trained the same
[16:18:28] <signalblue> like what are the benefits of peering?
[16:18:30] <Activ8> some front line workers chose to do more research and learning activities to improve
[16:18:34] <Hunterkll> Activ8: i've had almost universally the same experience be it sales/retention or tech support 
[16:18:36] <Activ8> this is why you get a mix mash of knowledge
[16:18:36] <signalblue> to everyone I mean
[16:18:42] <Hunterkll> and i never get the same person 
[16:18:48] <Hunterkll> since they're not exactly a small company
[16:18:50] <Hunterkll> signalblue: shorter paths
[16:19:00] <signalblue> faster speeds?
[16:19:03] <Activ8> the isp must ensure people know keywords that come through
[16:19:04] <Hunterkll> signalblue: for example, to get to washington DC (70-100 miles away) I have to go almost 200 miles north first 
[16:19:07] <Hunterkll> via router hops
[16:19:09] <Hunterkll> to go back south
[16:19:11] <Activ8> maybe the managers collect data on keywords
[16:19:14] <signalblue> like i get that it's less hops
[16:19:23] <signalblue> but what does that mean in terms of usability
[16:19:25] <Hunterkll> lower latency/shorter path/less things to go wrong 
[16:19:27] <estranger> lower latency
[16:19:28] <Activ8> there's only so many words you can throw at an isp when it comes to your net connection
[16:19:33] <Hunterkll> less chance for packet loss too 
[16:19:37] <Activ8> yeh
[16:19:37] <Hunterkll> and easier to diagnose/support
[16:19:50] <signalblue> i mean... these things don't break too often
[16:19:55] <Hunterkll> hahahahahahhahaha
[16:19:58] <estranger> you'd be surprised
[16:20:01] <signalblue> i can't remember the last time I had internet issues
[16:20:05] <signalblue> at home or at work
[16:20:06] <signalblue> lol
[16:20:19] <signalblue> it's been literal AGES
[16:20:22] <Hunterkll> signalblue: I once found a faulty line card in a verizon distro router while working at an MSP 
[16:20:22] <estranger> half the internet melts down every quarter
[16:20:25] <Hunterkll> the only symptom?
[16:20:32] <Hunterkll> youtube videos would load and not play
[16:20:33] <Hunterkll> that's it
[16:20:38] <signalblue> yeah
[16:20:39] <Hunterkll> that was the *only* thing that was showing wrong 
[16:20:44] <signalblue> that's normal...
[16:20:45] <Activ8> I have been with my isp for 5-6 years now on 80/20 within all this time I have called them once and this wasn't their fault a whole data center fire on another isp caused it
[16:20:46] <estranger> some putz fucks up bgp... again
[16:21:08] <signalblue> but I don't overclock my router or do stupid with it's topology...
[16:21:08] <Hunterkll> estranger: nah, was an actual faulted line card that was causing intermittent packet loss bout not faulting properly on the management engines 
[16:21:19] <Activ8> that was a full line fault, downtime 1 hour 
[16:21:20] <Hunterkll> signalblue: no no - t his was in *verizon's* central office
[16:21:22] <Hunterkll> their shit 
[16:21:24] <signalblue> oh
[16:21:27] <signalblue> their stuff
[16:21:28] <estranger> only isp outage I've had since moving here js when construction cut the fiber branch to my neighborhood heh
[16:21:30] <signalblue> nice
[16:21:37] <Hunterkll> the client was a doctor's office that had a verizon connection 
[16:21:43] <Hunterkll> so they were using bog standard hardware managed by us 
[16:22:12] <Hunterkll> centrally managed routers, etc
[16:22:15] <Hunterkll> no fucking stupid shit 
[16:22:17] <estranger> I'm on 80/80 but get 120/120
[16:22:34] <Hunterkll> then sometimes you get major backbone outages
[16:22:41] <Hunterkll> level3's especially good for that 
[16:22:50] <signalblue> head end bandwidth?
[16:22:50] <Hunterkll> comcast can pretty much route around L3 when they go down 
[16:23:01] <signalblue> what do you mean by head end bandwidth?
[16:23:10] <Hunterkll> signalblue: how much oversold the node you're on is 
[16:23:15] <signalblue> oh
[16:23:28] <Hunterkll> even FIOS is oversold like a motherfucker
[16:23:36] <Activ8> the next connection I can go up to is 330/50
[16:23:37] <signalblue> essentially how often you're getting the "up-to" speed
[16:23:39] <Hunterkll> GPON circuits have limited bandwidth, and you're sharing with like 16-64 other people 
[16:23:47] <Activ8> but not willing to pay the cost for it 
[16:23:50] <Hunterkll> on that fiber loop
[16:23:56] <estranger> I got att and I think it's gpon
[16:24:03] <Hunterkll> if it's fiber, it's gpon 
[16:24:08] <Hunterkll> though sometimes uverse connections are VDSL 
[16:24:13] <estranger> yup
[16:24:14] <Hunterkll> which would be copper phone line 
[16:24:39] <estranger> fiber to the house here
[16:24:47] <signalblue> ^
[16:24:47] <Hunterkll> yea then it's gpon
[16:24:51] <signalblue> yes
[16:24:57] <Hunterkll> if it's not gpon, then you're paying out the ass for a real line
[16:24:58] <Hunterkll> :P
[16:25:06] <signalblue> and if it's oversold then speeds go down
[16:25:08] <Hunterkll> and they had to run it specially for you hooked back up in their datacenter
[16:25:10] <Hunterkll> lol
[16:25:17] <estranger> I dunno why ppl here choose spectrum 
[16:25:27] <estranger> guess if it's bundled with cable tv
[16:25:42] <signalblue> Hunterkll: how many people per GPON do you recommend?
[16:25:45] <estranger> also guess I should be glad
[16:25:50] <Hunterkll> fucked if i know
[16:25:53] <estranger> "it depends"
[16:25:54] <Hunterkll> i don't run gpon networks
[16:25:57] <Hunterkll> that's consumer access shit
[16:25:58] <Hunterkll> yea
[16:26:05] <Hunterkll> average usage vs head end bandwidth basically
[16:26:06] <signalblue> then what the heck do you run
[16:26:18] <Hunterkll> uh
[16:26:21] <Hunterkll> what do you mean?
[16:26:32] <Hunterkll> nobody uses gpon for internal company networks or home networks......
[16:26:41] <signalblue> yeah
[16:26:45] <estranger> I don't run shit anymore, life is great
[16:26:48] <signalblue> lol
[16:26:51] <Hunterkll> it's literally an edge consumer access technology 
[16:26:57] <signalblue> gpon is not internal
[16:27:04] <signalblue> actually... can it be used internally?
[16:27:09] <Hunterkll> i mean, it could
[16:27:12] <Hunterkll> if you really wanted to
[16:27:20] <Hunterkll> but if you're already running fiber, then what the fuck would you do that for
[16:27:21] <signalblue> i kinda do
[16:27:30] <Hunterkll> might as well run OM3 and do straight symmetrical 10gig if you're cheap
[16:27:32] <signalblue> just for the sake of doing it
[16:27:37] <estranger> lol
[16:27:52] <Hunterkll> it'll be a pretty penny to set up a home network of gpon tech
[16:27:58] <estranger> that's not a reason hehe

[16:28:42] <Hunterkll> yea
[16:28:44] <Hunterkll> https://store.ui.com/collections/operator-ufiber/products/ufiber-4-olt
[16:28:51] <Hunterkll> that's your probably cheapest option vs surplus shit on ebay 
[16:28:54] *** Quits: Kiernian (~Kiernian@user/kiernian) (Quit: Leaving)
[16:29:03] <Hunterkll> 128 clients per gpon port, 4 gpon ports 
[16:29:19] <signalblue> and then I'll use gpedit to configure it
[16:29:27] <Hunterkll> 2.488gbps max downstream, 1.244gbit max upload
[16:29:37] <Hunterkll> so if you have a single gpon terminal on the client side, you co uld get t hose speeds
[16:29:38] <signalblue> right? gpedit will manage gpon...
[16:29:45] <Hunterkll> two, they duel for the bandwidth unless you limit them
[16:30:54] <Hunterkll> cable can -th eroetically - also get better latency than GPON networks *under load*
[16:31:00] <Hunterkll> GPON you can think of almost as like token ring 
[16:31:00] *** Joins: djhankb (~djhankb@208.113.164.68)
[16:31:08] <Hunterkll> whereas cable networks are more like a direct connection like DSL 
[16:31:55] <Hunterkll> GPON is a time division technology, so your router has to wait for the next available send slot it's assigned to transmit its data
[16:34:34] *** Quits: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[16:35:06] <Hunterkll> signalblue: long and short of it is - you might have gigabit from verizon, but you might have 5-10 people sharing a 2.44gbit/sec port who also all have "gigabit"
[16:53:36] <signalblue> Hunterkll: right but that means that I won't get the full gigabit speed, correct? 
[16:53:46] <Hunterkll> well you will
[16:53:53] <Hunterkll> if there's enough available downstream bandwidth
[16:54:17] <Hunterkll> depends on what the other people are doing
[16:54:45] *** Joins: Roughy (~mdaw45ns@user/roughy)
[16:54:46] <signalblue> assuming everyone is downloading linux ISOs at the same time, I won't, right?
[16:55:02] <signalblue> everyone is essentially competing for that bandwidth
[16:55:07] <Hunterkll> right
[16:55:18] <Hunterkll> it'd be like if you were downloading 5 files at the same time or whatever
[16:55:22] <signalblue> yeah
[16:55:32] <signalblue> but can there be 1:1 GPON?
[16:55:33] <Hunterkll> works the exact same way
[16:55:45] <Hunterkll> i guess?
[16:55:49] <signalblue> like if you run a line from the DC to here
[16:55:57] <signalblue> then there'd be no competition
[16:56:01] <Hunterkll> i mean, sure? you could have a 2.4/1.4 head end 
[16:56:07] <Hunterkll> and set the downstream terminal to 2/1 
[16:56:11] <Hunterkll> and have full bandwidth
[16:56:12] <Hunterkll> i suppose
[16:56:29] <signalblue> that'd mean paying out the wazoo to run a line
[16:56:36] <Hunterkll> like
[16:56:38] <Hunterkll> at that point
[16:56:40] <Hunterkll> like i said before
[16:56:45] <Hunterkll> just run regular fiber and use regular fiber shit
[16:56:56] <signalblue> which is what I do
[16:56:58] <Hunterkll> cost less in hardware and works .... like regular ethernet.... because it is....
[16:57:13] <Hunterkll> GPON is used because it's a timeshare tech you can chain multiple terminals onto 
[16:58:10] <signalblue> why set the downstream to 2/1?
[16:58:19] *** Quits: ksx4system (~ksx4syste@gaia.mgst.eu) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[16:58:19] <signalblue> and not 2.1/4.1
[16:58:24] <Hunterkll> overhead and making it reliable 
[16:58:28] <Hunterkll> where the fuck did you get 4.1?
[16:58:35] <signalblue> 1.4 I mean
[16:58:46] <Hunterkll> the gpon throughput is 'true' throughput 
[16:58:57] <Hunterkll> not counting gpon overhead, TDMA wait times, etc 
[16:59:03] <Hunterkll> so it's just sane
[16:59:03] <signalblue> minimizing packet loss by setting the bandwith lower?
[16:59:08] <Hunterkll> ... no
[16:59:16] <Hunterkll> saying you aren't gonna get 2.44 on the access side
[16:59:20] <Hunterkll> because some of that is overhead
[16:59:36] <signalblue> so we're accounting for that by making it 2/1
[16:59:46] <Hunterkll> sure
[16:59:48] <Hunterkll> we can go with that
[17:00:07] <Hunterkll> on the remote side you're not gonna have a 'true' link - your GPON terminal is converting GPON to ethernet 
[17:00:15] <signalblue> yes
[17:01:06] <signalblue> TDMA wait time is different from latency, right?
[17:01:11] <signalblue> like in your definatiob
[17:01:15] <signalblue> defination*
[17:01:16] <Hunterkll> it can add latency
[17:01:17] <Hunterkll> :>
[17:01:29] <Hunterkll> on a GPON loop only one terminal at a time can transmit
[17:01:37] <Hunterkll> so the terminal has to wait for its time slot to shoot out its light
[17:01:59] <signalblue> thats became... two terminals can't shoot light at the same time
[17:02:01] <Hunterkll> so on a loaded multi-user circuit, you're adding latency because of that 
[17:02:05] <Hunterkll> right
[17:02:10] <Hunterkll> GPON is a loop - like old token ring 
[17:02:11] <signalblue> any way around that?
[17:02:21] <Hunterkll> downstream is blasted to all terminals at once, so that's not an issue, but upstream is one terminal at a time
[17:02:28] <Hunterkll> sure - direct connections
[17:02:30] <Hunterkll> instead of loops
[17:02:45] <signalblue> essentially no GPON then
[17:04:32] <signalblue> where would the GPON terminal be located?
[17:04:42] <Hunterkll> ..... that little box verizon gives you that acts as the router
[17:04:45] <Hunterkll> is also a gpon terminal
[17:04:46] <Hunterkll> lol
[17:04:51] <signalblue> the modem?
[17:04:56] <signalblue> because it's a combo

[17:05:57] <Hunterkll> even when they're just dropping you an ethernet jack
[17:05:58] <signalblue> well it's in bridge mode
[17:06:02] <Hunterkll> you still have that GPON terminal in play

[17:07:32] <ender> PPPoE isn't a problem if you can terminate it on your own equipment
[17:07:50] <Hunterkll> there's more to it than that with gpon
[17:07:54] <Hunterkll> a fair bit more settings
[17:08:00] <signalblue> PPPoeE is not encrypted
[17:08:34] <Hunterkll> i mean, there are a few generic GPON terminals out there - even tp-link has one
[17:08:36] <ender> who cares?
[17:08:38] <signalblue> yeah
[17:08:47] <Hunterkll> but you need the ONT profiles, network data, DBA stuff, etc 
[17:09:20] <signalblue> just copy that config from the ISP given one
[17:09:28] <Hunterkll> the ISP ... doesn't give that to you
[17:09:35] <ender> here if you have GPON, that's all ISP's equipment, and you get either raw ethernet or PPPoE (depends on the ISP)

[17:52:44] <Hunterkll> it's just more usage

[17:53:36] <Hunterkll> hahahahaha
[17:53:44] <csws> I lent them 3 fibre channel HBAs lol
[17:54:06] <Hunterkll> csws: i've had multiple times i've exported configs from my home shit to import at work when i said "yea, i can deploy this tomorrow" and people were like straight up - one manager said "i don't believe you"
[17:54:08] <Hunterkll> lol ok
[17:54:48] <csws> they got stuck big time on a migration so my trash pile came in handy
[17:54:58] <csws> it was a Temporary Solutionâ„¢
[17:55:07] <csws> it lasted nearly 6 months
[17:56:52] <Hunterkll> if work ever needed hardware from me, they better be payin' for it

[18:13:39] <signalblue> Hunterkll: under a normal configuration with fiber to the premises, what are the GPON terminals set to
[18:13:42] <signalblue> >
[18:14:12] <signalblue> I mean you said that you can set the downstream terminals to 2/4 
[18:14:41] <Hunterkll> .... 
[18:14:42] <Hunterkll> no
[18:14:47] <Hunterkll> 2/1  or so
[18:14:48] <Hunterkll> but
[18:14:53] <signalblue> <Hunterkll> i mean, sure? you could have a 2.4/1.4 head end 
[18:14:53] <signalblue> <Hunterkll> and set the downstream terminal to 2/1 
[18:14:53] <signalblue> <Hunterkll> and have full bandwidth
[18:14:53] <signalblue> so I wonder what they are set to under a normal config/by default
[18:14:54] <Hunterkll> signalblue: they're set to whatever you're paying for
[18:15:01] <Hunterkll> lol
[18:15:30] <signalblue> so is it TR-069 they use to change them?
[18:15:43] <signalblue> like what's stopping someone from changing those values themselves
[18:15:53] <Hunterkll> ....... nothing?
[18:16:04] <Hunterkll> you have two values in a gpon profile
[18:16:10] <Hunterkll> minimum guaranteed, and maximum allowable
[18:16:25] <Hunterkll> minimum guaranteed is gonna be what you'll get if every node is firing off the chain all at once
[18:16:31] <Hunterkll> thats your dedicated slice
[18:16:36] <Hunterkll> maximum is the 'up to' you're paying for
[18:16:42] <signalblue> If I increase the minimum guaranteed, would that increase my bottom lines?
[18:17:02] <Hunterkll> sure - if you can convince verizon to provision your unit & configure that on their side as well
[18:17:14] <Hunterkll> config has to match 
[18:17:15] <Hunterkll> :)
[18:17:16] <signalblue> so it must match on both sides
[18:17:29] <Hunterkll> you ain't gettin early 2000s cab le modem uncappin' shenanigans like that
[18:17:30] <Hunterkll> lol
[18:17:44] <signalblue> if there is a mismatch then I assume nothing will work, right?
