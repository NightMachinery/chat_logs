[12:32:18] <mnhrdt> rigid: i'd rather call gnuplot once for each plot, and then compose your end image by pasting each plot into its place, isn't it simpler?
[12:35:52] <rigid> yeah, but where is the fun in THAT :)
[12:35:56] <rigid> mnhrdt: now that you say it I can't help feeling a little bit stupid
[12:36:12] <rigid> i guess graphicsmagick would do the trick
[12:37:45] <rigid> The initial reason was I'm using munin which does plots using gnuplot. I wanted to seamlessly integrate. But I guess I could just fiddle something in.
[13:00:31] <mnhrdt> i mean it's an ugly hack, but it looks like it should work :)
[13:01:18] <mnhrdt> you can compose the end raster image using imagemagick
[13:01:33] <mnhrdt> but maybe it's better to use a vector-based format
[13:01:40] <mnhrdt> like a svg that includes other svg
[13:02:02] <mnhrdt> e.g., you write a svg file with your layout, which is always the same
[13:02:20] <mnhrdt> and that svg file includes each gnuplot-generated plot into its place
