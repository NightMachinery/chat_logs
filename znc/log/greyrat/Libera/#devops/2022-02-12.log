[05:33:04] <justsomeguy> Has anyone here taken the MIT xPRO courses for DevOps or Cybersecurity? What did you think? How were the labs set up -- did they use real VMs?
[05:34:05] * justsomeguy wants to take all the courses, but is afraid of crummy JS based browser imitations of a real command-line environment.
[05:54:50] <lantech19446> clearly justsomeguy has experienced kodekloud
[06:28:51] *** Joins: k8yun (~k8yun@user/k8yun)
[06:34:28] <justsomeguy> Things like that. It was an online course for the Linux+ cert with a broken JS based simulation of bash shell + coreutils.
[06:34:42] <Dus10> not seen it, but I would love to get more info
[06:35:01] <Dus10> I am working on developing a similar course for a community college right now
[06:35:21] <Dus10> it will be online so hopefully the cheap community college tuition makes it super accessible to anyone
[06:36:58] <justsomeguy> It's this one. https://executive-ed.xpro.mit.edu/professional-certificate-cybersecurity
[06:37:19] <Dus10> hmm
[06:37:26] <Dus10> maybe I can get work to pay for that
[06:37:36] <Dus10> I was looking for some graduate school cert for something like this
[06:37:47] <Dus10> the Simplicert or whatever it is called
[06:37:53] <Dus10> turns out, it isn't real credits or anything
[06:38:06] <justsomeguy> Honestly, I'm not sure it's worth it. Maybe the OSCP certification learning subscription is better. There is more information on how the lab environment is set up. https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/
[06:38:24] <Dus10> yeah, we're going to be using AWS
[06:38:56] <Dus10> the community college was the first academic partner with them so the student will all have their own subscriptions already
[06:39:21] <Dus10> ours is definitely geared more on IaC, but we cover the high level broader DevOps stuff first
[06:39:45] <Dus10> I have been trying to get Hashicorp to get involved
[06:40:01] <Dus10> in my primary role, we are a big (maybe the biggest) HC partner, too
[06:40:27] <Dus10> the people we work with in our partnership aren't responding to any of my messages about an academic partnership, though :(
[06:40:52] <justsomeguy> Thats sounds awesome. I hope you're able to get everything coordinated.
[06:40:56] <Dus10> I honestly do see a ton of DevOps in the curriculum for the MIT program
[06:41:22] <Dus10> yeah, we're planning on running the course this summer with the college's "Learn Anywhere" model
[06:41:45] <Dus10> so it is a "live" course where students can be on-site, via Zoom, or just asynchronous
[06:42:02] <Dus10> in the Fall, we will just do the online version that will be asynchronous
[06:43:02] <justsomeguy> Nice. I'm tempted to ask if you want a beta tester. I like editing prose and breaking software / IaC scripts.
[06:43:34] <Dus10> I am very early in the development right now
[06:43:41] <Dus10> my day job has been way too busy lately
[06:43:55] <Dus10> I am actually going to run it for work internally, first
[06:44:24] <justsomeguy> I figured as much. Good luck, though. That sounds really fun, and also hard to do well.
[06:44:44] <justsomeguy> Well, maybe not that hard for you. For me it would be hard.
[06:45:08] <slaughter> Just give 'em two sticks and tell 'em to build you a SaaS
[06:45:12] <slaughter> That'll learn 'em good
[06:45:14] <justsomeguy> :D
[06:46:34] <Dus10> well, I think I am ready to start working on it now
[06:47:01] <Dus10> 22:16 here now... 8 pints of Hefeweizen and 4 fingers of Scotch... I can do anything!
[06:47:05] <slaughter> Oooh actually, first project: build Dus10 a learning platform
[06:47:19] <slaughter> Damn dude I'd be done for the weekend after that
[06:47:31] <justsomeguy> Hefe's are my favorite beer :)
[06:47:31] <Dus10> if someone did that for me, they could take whatever class I do for free!
[06:48:05] <Dus10> wei√übier is the best beer
[06:48:08] <Dus10> objectively
[06:48:14] <Dus10> if you disagree, you're wrong
[06:48:14] <justsomeguy> clearly
[06:48:28] <slaughter> I disagree, and yet I am right
[06:48:42] <Dus10> nope
[06:48:51] <Dus10> I can't allow that
[06:49:10] <slaughter> Barrel aged imperial stouts
[06:49:11] <slaughter> Case closed
[06:49:18] <Dus10> the beatings will continue until morale increases
[06:49:21] <slaughter> A really good and proper sour
[06:49:29] <slaughter> Case reopened, and then closed again
[06:49:43] <slaughter> A mexican lager with lime on a hot day
[06:49:53] <Dus10> if I want something barrel aged... I drink whiskey
[06:50:15] <slaughter> Yeah then they use those barrels to make amazing beer
[06:50:16] <Dus10> like this Macallan I am drinking right now
[06:50:33] <slaughter> Oh god scotch ugh
[06:50:48] <Dus10> you're clearly uncultured :)
[06:50:56] <Dus10> :p
[06:51:06] <Dus10> I tell you something awesome
[06:51:18] <Dus10> a couple of weekends ago I went to a new-ish distillery here
[06:51:24] <Dus10> Indiana Rye Whiskey
[06:51:29] <Dus10> chef kiss
[06:51:44] <slaughter> Hmm never had any Indiana rye
[06:51:45] <Dus10> I got some of their first batch they have made... straight from the cash
[06:51:47] <Dus10> cask
[06:51:51] <slaughter> Plenty of Kentucky and Tennessee
[06:51:55] <Dus10> 120 proof
[06:52:01] <slaughter> I do love me some rye whiskey, it's my go-to actually
[06:52:01] * justsomeguy likes japaneese whisky, becuase he's a filthy whisky tourist.
[06:52:04] <Dus10> super nice
[06:52:15] <slaughter> Yo some Japanese whiskey is top tier amazing
[06:52:34] <slaughter> Some is quite whiskey tourist though
[06:52:38] <Dus10> I need to go buy a couple of bottles of their first batch
[06:52:46] <Dus10> one to hide from myself for 20 years
[06:52:48] <Dus10> another to drink right now
[06:53:26] <slaughter> Or you could go for a great and relatively inexpensive daily rye - https://drizly.com/liquor/whiskey/rye-whiskey/bulleit-rye/p2265
[06:53:31] <justsomeguy> I really enjoyed a bottle of nikka coffee grain whisky once.
[06:53:39] <Dus10> I have had a ton...
[06:53:41] <slaughter> YESSSS NIKKA COFFE GRAIN YES
[06:53:42] <Dus10> and that is Indiana Rye
[06:53:54] <slaughter> Nay, tis Kentucky
[06:54:03] <Dus10> they are based in Kentucky
[06:54:10] <Dus10> their Rye is distilled in Indiana, though
[06:54:21] <Dus10> their bourbon is in Kentucky
[06:54:35] <slaughter> Huh you are correct. Weird. Still KY whiskey IMO
[06:54:38] <Dus10> gotta read that label, as tough as it is when you're inedbriated
[06:54:40] <justsomeguy> You all seem cool af, lol
[06:54:56] <Dus10> I am, yep
[06:55:02] <Dus10> thanks for recognizing :)
[06:55:09] <Dus10> dude, whiskey is amazing stuff
[06:55:12] <Dus10> brings people together
[06:55:38] <Dus10> I almost sold all of my stuff and quit my job when I was in the distillery
[06:55:46] <Dus10> I was ready to just work there for the rest of my life
[06:55:56] <Dus10> my wife says when I retire
[06:56:47] <Dus10> I almost cut my thumb off on a damned mandolin slicer while making some German potato salad...
[06:56:57] <Dus10> I got through that downing a bottle of Bulleit
[06:57:01] <Dus10> great stuff
[06:57:20] <slaughter> Dus10 are you in the US?
[06:57:24] <Dus10> in retrospect... it wasn't helping with the bleeding... but I didn't care
[06:57:26] <Dus10> yeah
[06:57:31] <Dus10> I am in Indiana, actually :)
[06:57:34] <slaughter> Ah shit I thought you were in europe for some reason
[06:57:55] <slaughter> My condolences
[06:58:02] <slaughter> I grew up in TN/KY 
[06:58:06] <Dus10> I hang out with Euro folk very often
[06:58:14] <Dus10> sounds like my family
[06:58:24] <slaughter> I think it's just that everyone in this channel is from Eruope
[06:58:26] <Dus10> always crossing those borders for a hundred years
[06:58:34] <Dus10> could be that too
[06:59:08] <Dus10> and... more Macallan
[06:59:13] <slaughter> One side of my family is actually so "from Tennessee" that tracing family lineage back to like 1800 shows they've lived in the same county the whole time
[06:59:23] <justsomeguy> Ah, I want to travel, but the world is crazy~
[06:59:24] <slaughter> Kentucky was just a weird side trip, hate that place so much
[06:59:35] <Dus10> ha, yeah, me too
[06:59:45] <Dus10> my wife's father's family is like TN royalty
[06:59:51] <Dus10> they found it
[06:59:56] <Dus10> founded...
[07:00:05] <slaughter> Like, the whole state?
[07:00:12] <Dus10> and they founded the unrecognized state of Franklin that preceded it
[07:00:16] <Dus10> yeah
[07:00:31] <Dus10> first governor is her like 7x great grandfather
[07:01:12] <Dus10> they are descended from Basque folks... including St. Francis
[07:01:28] <Dus10> they have a county and a river in TN named after them
[07:01:31] <Dus10> and a town
[07:01:31] <slaughter> When the conspiracy was uncovered in 1797, he was expelled from the Senate and became the first federal official to face impeachment.
[07:01:34] <slaughter> Well damn
[07:02:18] <slaughter> Well, enjoy the gross scotch
[07:03:39] <Dus10> Macallan is great
[07:03:41] <Dus10> expensive, though
[07:03:56] <Dus10> I am really freaking out because Costco is basically not stocking Scotch
[07:04:19] <Dus10> I bought up a few bottles of Macallan after my real jam, Aberfeldy, was exhausted
