[01:36:33] *** Quits: esro (~esro@nat1.krakowskiinternet.pl) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:36:52] <bpalmer> foo: but there will usually be some tests that should talk to some external systems -- these will usually be slower so won't be run as often. Different python testing frameworks have different ways of separating these concepts out
[01:38:13] <foo> bpalmer: really appreciate it, I ddin't realize this is where unit tests / integration tests line gets drawn. I believe "integration tests" test the "high level logic" of an app, rather than testing every single function (which is what we're doing). Which type of test generally has a "test database" ? unit or integration?
[01:39:32] <EdFletcher> here's another way to think about the distinction (on the same lines): any part of your code that must talk to anything external cannot be "unit" tested by definition, because it's no longer a "unit" (individual) thing, it's at very least two
[01:40:28] <EvilDMP> I'm wondering how to handle a case where under certain conditions, a class should have additional functionality available to it. The specific example is a class used to drive a hardware plotter. At present, it can be invoked with a "turtle=True" argument, and then a Python turtle graphics representation of it will be created as a Turtle subclass.
[01:40:38] *** Joins: forgotmynick (uid24625@id-24625.hampstead.irccloud.com)
[01:41:03] <EvilDMP> But it seems messy, since the Turtle subclass has then to mimic all the actions of the main class.
[01:41:06] <EdFletcher> enforcing this definition actually helps you factor out large functions, because when you try to go and _unit_ test them you'll need to break them into individual _units_ of logic that _can_ be unit tested 😃
[01:41:10] <bpalmer> foo: EdFletcher's point is precisely the way I think of it. Unit tests are completely self contained.

[03:08:44] <nedbat> foo: they should list all of the arguments.
[03:09:13] <bpalmer> It depends. I switch between two style of docstrings: one for 'trivial' functions and one for substantial functions.

[13:59:34] <montpol> Luyin no problem but in general is the words after the file somehow added to the file or commands from the file?
[14:00:10] <Luyin> montpol: the way this works is that "bootstrap" and "test" are handed as positional arguments to the ctrl.py file and in that file is some code to interpret/parse what that is supposed to mean

[15:25:02] <rubin55> What would be the most pythonic way to check if a dict has keys matching partial/regex names? For example, let's say you have os.environ as dict, and you want to check if it has keys matching 'FOO_[a-zA-Z0-9].+_BAR'? and return those?

[18:24:58] <SnoopJ> Cheaterman, Starlette does something like this for its routes, the user can write sync or async, but the result is always async: https://github.com/encode/starlette/blob/e086fc2da361767b532cf690e5203619bbae98aa/starlette/routing.py#L64-L67

[19:26:57] <Sebulba> yeah:p   earlier, but yall are having a heated dns discussion so i assume it vanished into the null :p
[19:27:22] <Sebulba> i think dunder doesnt hold any data so its not possible to perhaps define something with it

[19:28:02] <Sebulba> im new at python but i heard dunder doesnt hold any data
[19:28:18] <TML> I don't know what "i heard dunder doesnt hold any data" means

[19:29:09] <phy1729> CrtxReavr: https://github.com/crwilcox/dunder-mifflin
[19:29:34] <CrtxReavr> Class method names that start with __ are "secret" - should only be called by instances of that class . .
[19:29:46] <CrtxReavr> there is a way to kludge around that, but it'd not be good practices.
[19:29:47] <SnoopJ> They aren't "secret"
[19:30:39] <SnoopJ> rapha, well, if you have a reference to the class, you can change things on it. This will generally apply to all dunders, because they take an instance as their first argument (and you can get the class from the instance). Actually doing that is probably a bad idea, though.
[19:30:46] <CrtxReavr> phy1729, the internet. . . where people with too much time on their hands do their best(worst) work.
[19:30:56] <grym> CrtxReavr: and dunders have a postfixed __ as well.  (__foo is not a dunder; __doc__ is, i'm pretty sure)

[23:04:30] <BrokenCog> I'm using python REPL in xterm ...
[23:05:23] *** Quits: jpn (~jpn@user/jpn) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:05:29] <SnoopJ> BrokenCog, that sounds like you're copying from something that has inconsistent indentation, or the indentation is being garbled in transit somehow
[23:05:58] <SnoopJ> oh, or maybe you're copying from source that has empty lines in class/function definitions? The REPL doesn't like those very much.
[23:06:04] <BrokenCog> ahhh it's actually not that ... turns out it's blank lines.  I have:
[23:06:07] <BrokenCog> def mt():
[23:06:11] <BrokenCog>    line1
[23:06:16] <SnoopJ> yea, an empty line is how the REPL knows you're done defining [thing]

[23:06:39] <BrokenCog> right.

[23:07:13] * SnoopJ usually just copies to a file and runs as `python3 -i thatfile.py` to get a REPL, if need be.

[23:10:05] <TML> I see, you're trying to modify the function definition
[23:10:16] <BrokenCog> yes.
[23:10:39] <BrokenCog> initially I started copy-paste the first few lines of the fucntion ... so I can tinker with the subsequent few lines.
[23:10:54] <BrokenCog> If I could reload that function, I could use an editor outside the REPL.

[23:12:26] <SnoopJ> although speaking from experience doing exactly what you're doing, it really is most convenient to have the definition in an input cell, and re-run that cell after changing it

[23:42:17] <Wooble> sveinse: for one thing, a float is limited to 64 bits while a decimal is arbitrary precision
[23:42:33] <sveinse> I believe the same formulae for IEEE754 is (-1)**sign * mantissa * 2**expornent, so the principal difference is that the base 2 vs the base 10 implies what values can be accurately represented and not
[23:42:48] <SnoopJ> sveinse, right, floats are *guaranteed* to not be able to represent some values

[23:43:36] <Wooble> huh, TIL that if you don't have the C extension for decimal you get even more precision.

[23:45:10] <Wooble> (the C library won't allow precision more than 999999999999999999 while the pure python one just uses python ints. you'll run out of RAM before you hit the limit anyway)

[23:45:38] <esaym153> But it is slower!! </sarcasm>
[23:46:26] <sveinse> It kind of makes sense. If int is able to handle arbitrary precision, then there is no reason why the coefficient and exponent (which is integer values) of Decimal can hold arbitrary size.
[23:46:41] <Wooble> to be fair if you're really storing numbers that each consume a significant part of your RAM, you might actual notice the slowness.

[23:52:22] <grym> i'm wrong though
[23:52:34] <sveinse> Yeah, the start point is that I'm having this ever increasing Decimal variable of some time data. I wanted to know if I had to make this variable reset at certain intervals. If my math holds out, this will produce approx 44 bits of information in one year.
[23:52:42] <montpol> so these two lines all the do is create to defaults that is made from the user and the argparser has no previous info about "num_threads" and taking in a path?
[23:52:44] <sveinse> grym: bitbucket doesn't support mercurial any more
[23:52:51] <montpol>  cli.parser.set_defaults(output_path=join(wd, "build", "vunit", "output")) ;    cli.parser.set_defaults(num_threads=1)
