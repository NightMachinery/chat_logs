[00:03:38] <bpmedley> Anyone used TryParse in ASP.NET Core 6?  Initial impressions are it's amazing.
[00:04:51] <merced> what does it do
[00:05:02] <Diablo-D3> I assume it tries to parse.
[00:05:38] <bpmedley> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis?view=aspnetcore-6.0#custom-binding
[00:06:24] <Nasp> Hmm is that model binding or system.text.json or
[00:06:37] <Nasp> Because i think i saw they wanted serializers to try and use those but i dont think it's ready
[00:06:46] <bpmedley> Nasp : I used it for model binding, however, I don't think I'm using system.text.json
[00:07:10] <Nasp> IS it only minimal api or
[00:07:29] <bpmedley> I'm not sure if TryParse is only for Minimal API.  Would feel limiting if it was..
[00:07:49] <Nasp> Also it's not exactrly new is it
[00:07:51] <Nasp> Just the way you do it
[00:08:24] <Nasp> Diablo-D3:  Standing motorized desks have been the norm for years, but each time i see something from the states it's those weird on top of a desk stading desks
[00:08:26] <bpmedley> Model Binding has been around a while, as you mention.  I have not seen TryParse, but I'm still learning..
[00:08:55] <Nasp> Model binding have alwys been a bit of a bitch tbh

[08:30:46] <bkool> which is a really weird default tbh. None of our .net core projects are using System.Text.Json. In Startup.cs the serialization is all confligured for json.net
[08:33:37] <bkool> I'd like to switch but every test the serialization fails miserably. like json.net/newtonsoft has 10 years of exp and MS took none of that into account.

[12:26:12] <Nasp> And one meant it was secure
[12:26:13] <jmer> same with cryptocurrencies. I could see how the tech could work if it's not based on wasting CPU Cycles and it's backed by a government
[12:26:24] <Nasp> "If you make charities through it, then you couldn't fake charities like some people do"
[12:26:25] <Nasp> Ehm yes you ca
[12:26:31] <Nasp> "You just dont know how blockchain works then"
[12:26:33] <biberu> jmer: so do you have smart friends, or dumb friends that you don't want to offend?
[12:26:36] *** Joins: Babbage (~babbage@dmu-admin.dmu.ac.uk)
[12:26:44] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Or just no crypto at all?
[12:26:53] <Nasp> Isn't it better to use renewable for as much as possible
[12:27:03] <jmer> biberu: Either they know it's dumb so no reason to discuss it or they themselves are dumb or they don't even know it exists
[12:27:04] <Nasp> Or even better, work some crypto currencies into BOINC
[12:27:10] <JakeSays> Nasp: why would you want to get rid of crypto?
[12:27:11] <Nasp> That way we  atleast get something good out of it
[12:27:19] <Nasp> JakeSays:  I dont but the mining surely
[12:27:36] <JakeSays> but you just said "or no crypto at all"
[12:27:40] <biberu> yeah, the mining needs to stop
[12:27:53] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Mine no crypto at all
[12:27:56] <JakeSays> biberu: no, dirty mining needs to stop
[12:28:14] <JakeSays> Nasp: crypto wouldn't exist w/o mining
[12:28:31] <Nasp> I know
[12:28:44] <JakeSays> so you want no crypto
[12:28:53] <Nasp> Well you can do crypto without mining
[12:28:59] <Nasp> But not sure if it's as secure
[12:29:04] <Slade> JakeSays, thats not true. mining is just one of the proof of works
[12:29:06] <Nasp> Never understood the proof of work thing
[12:29:09] <biberu> JakeSays: especially dirty mining, but also mining using renewables where that energy could have been put to use replacing dirty processes
[12:29:20] <Nasp> Yup that was kinda my point
[12:29:31] <JakeSays> Slade: there's no other way to do proof of work other than mining
[12:30:02] <Slade> JakeSays, no stable coin is mined
[12:30:12] <jmer> JakeSays: would it be possible to tie it to folding proteins or some other reasearch type computational work?
[12:30:17] <JakeSays> biberu: i disagree with that. let mining clean up itself, and other industries clean up themselves
[12:30:22] <Nasp> Nice a danish warship shot some pirates
[12:30:27] <JakeSays> jmer: that's still mining
[12:30:35] <jmer> JakeSays: but it would be useful
[12:30:42] <JakeSays> jmer: of course
[12:30:49] <Nasp> Ohh they rescued them
[12:31:01] <jmer> the current mining is just wasteful imho
[12:31:09] <Nasp> What do you mean with let industries clean themselves up
[12:31:19] <Nasp> And yeah it's a waste of resources
[12:31:22] <Babbage> hey
[12:31:36] <JakeSays> mining is no different than coal or oil. there is nothing wrong with coal and oil - they could be hugely environmentally friendly if used properly.
[12:32:18] <Babbage> got some special coal there that when burnt sucks co2 from the atmosphere? :)
[12:32:20] <Nasp> jmer:  They found a new variant in Botswana, don't tell Mette or she'll send the National guard
[12:32:21] <JakeSays> Nasp: let automobile and transportation take care of their own energy mess.
[12:32:39] <Nasp>  And what od oyu mean by that
[12:32:42] <jmer> Nasp: man I get that you're pissed about getting hit by the vaccine side effects, but honestly I can't stomache any more corona discussion xD
[12:32:42] <Nasp> That in 200 years they will clean it up
[12:32:46] <Nasp> Or that it's their own choice to do it
[12:32:57] <Nasp> jmer:  Nah this was just about her killing inks
[12:33:00] <JakeSays> Babbage: burning coal isn't the problem. letting the co2 escape is the problem.
[12:33:04] <Nasp> minks
[12:33:45] <jmer> Nasp: I can say this; Mette is the one person who ensured I will never vote on that side of the spectrum again.
[12:33:53] <Nasp> Yup
[12:34:20] <Nasp> Also didn't oyu get the joke?
[12:34:20] <JakeSays> Nasp: i mean, let autos convert to electricity to solve their pollution issues. don't stop mining clean crypto just because that clean energy could be used elsewhere.
[12:34:25] <jmer> but that's less related to corona or mink eradication... It's more about her "style" of arrogant leadership and willingness to sacrifice democracy to make herself and her party look better
[12:34:41] <Nasp> "I'll make it legal"
[12:34:45] <jmer> Nasp: I did get the joke, but... Corona just makes me go urgh...
[12:35:23] <Babbage> JakeSays: course burning coal is a problem, `letting the co2 escape` is just part of the result of which it takes lots of resource to stop it `escaping` (and ignores other dirty parts of coal as well etc.
[12:35:53] <Nasp> JakeSays: So ban non clean crypto
[12:35:58] <Nasp> Isn't that the same as banning all crypto really
[12:36:01] <Babbage> I for one look forward to our mini nucelar powered cars that we were promissed in the 1950's :D
[12:36:05] <JakeSays> Babbage: scrubbing co2 isn't a difficult process, and there is not much else to coal
[12:36:13] <Nasp> Babbage: I'm still waiting for my flying car
[12:36:13] <JakeSays> Nasp: no, not at all
[12:36:23] <biberu> JakeSays: it's a bit disingenuous to call it clean if it's just the last step in the process that's using renewable energy
[12:36:24] <JakeSays> Nasp: there are many ways to proof crypto
[12:36:34] <jmer> Babbage: that statement gave my Fallout-esque mental pictures xD
[12:36:36] <JakeSays> biberu: what?
[12:36:42] <Babbage> jake: except all the other shit that gets spewed out, especially dirtier coals
[12:36:52] <Nasp> Some people believe electric cars aren't clean
[12:36:58] <Babbage> jmer: see, now your talking. The Jetsons knew where it was at
[12:37:10] <jmer> Nasp: the prodcution of those electric cars isnt' clean, yet.
[12:37:18] <Nasp> sure but what production is
[12:37:18] <Babbage> nasp: all the waste batteries certainly arent but that is getting better
[12:37:22] <JakeSays> Babbage: there's not much else
[12:37:26] <Nasp> If the net output is negative, isn't it fine?
[12:37:44] <Nasp> Like nuclear is the only possible "clean" energy we have
[12:37:49] <jmer> Nasp: I added a "yet"
[12:37:51] <Nasp> But it takes coal and other resources to build one, damn
[12:37:53] <biberu> JakeSays: you still need industry to e.g. create the hardware for it, that's also consuming resources that might be dirty or could be put to other use, or just not spent at all
[12:37:56] <Nasp> So we can build those either
[12:38:06] <Babbage> Volvo and Mercedes have now started making zero carbon steel if I remember (or whatever its called0 that uses a new process of steel making that produces a tiny fraction of the co2 it currently does
[12:38:09] <Nasp> There's always the soylent green option
[12:38:36] <JakeSays> biberu: ok so other problems need to be solved. all it takes is engineering and motivation.
[12:38:38] <Nasp> Volvo and clean energy :D
[12:38:42] <JakeSays> Nasp: i'm on board with that
[12:38:42] <Babbage> im interested to see how Rolls Royce minature neuclear reactors work out
[12:39:09] <Nasp> I'm a bit excited about those small modular nuclear reactors
[12:39:21] <Nasp> Also give me nuclear powah

[12:39:33] <Nasp> Stupid windmills makes power so expensive
[12:39:44] <Babbage> takes the co2 out the steel creation process (is big part of it at the moment)
[12:40:03] <Nasp> That reminds me i just got invited to a talk at work about "green software"
[12:40:04] <Babbage> nasp: they were at first, not so much now
[12:40:10] <jmer> persoanlly, without any in depth knowledge at all so I am basically talking out my ass, I think we need nuclear to buy ourselves time to refine the fission technology
[12:40:19] <Nasp> jmer:  yes
[12:40:36] <Nasp> It's the only viable option
[12:40:45] <biberu> we can also use way less resources than we are
[12:40:47] <Nasp> Just look at germany, they are going in the wrong direction, burning more brown coal than ever
[12:41:06] <jmer> Well... I really can't say but it seems logical to my layman's eye
[12:41:42] <interop_madness> thermodynamically, climate neutrality is physically impossible
[12:41:43] <JakeSays> biberu: lol the title of that article is misleading. it's not "carbon free steel" it's "carbon free process of making steel"
[12:41:54] <biberu> JakeSays: Babbage ^
[12:41:56] <Nasp> Speaking of corona again, if we can close the world down for 2 years to save ourselves, why can't we do other choices that saves ourselves in 50-200 years
[12:42:24] <JakeSays> biberu: ah yes. sorry.
[12:42:38] <Nasp> jmer:  Work just ordered 80 Christmas trees at work, one for each employee
[12:42:39] <MizMahem> They don't detail it, but I assume it's just an Electric Arc Furnace run on "green" electricity. Hardly new tech.
[12:42:46] <Nasp> I feel like that's a bit of the oppostite of green image
[12:42:57] <JakeSays> MizMahem: probably. making steel still requires a lot of heat
[12:43:10] <biberu> Nasp: aren't danish trees green?
[12:43:32] <Babbage> yeah carbon free steel :) they dont need to wack lots of carbon into it any more
[12:43:36] <Nasp> Depends, is it a normandsgran or what kind
[12:43:40] <Babbage> a jigsaw peice in the buzzel
[12:44:11] <JakeSays> Babbage: well, steel is a carbon/iron alloy, so carbon is still required
[12:44:12] <Babbage> MizMahem: theres some good breakdowns on youtube on how it works
[12:44:47] <Babbage> if I remember the overall process involves 95%+ less carbon or something like that
[12:44:58] <Nasp> We also need to define what green and clean means
[12:45:04] <Nasp> Because nobody agrees on that either
[12:45:39] <JakeSays> Babbage: yeah it's not using carbon (fossil fuels) to heat the iron
[12:46:03] <JakeSays> i wonder if they're including the carbon used to mine the iron ore
[12:46:06] <Babbage> jake: or adding it in in the same way
[12:46:17] <Babbage> if we really want to sort this all out...
[12:46:30] <Babbage> gretta thunburg vs australian priminister - CAGE MATCH - winner takes all
[12:46:34] <JakeSays> Babbage: what do you mean, adding it in the same way
[12:46:46] <MizMahem> Electric Arc Furnaces also tend to rely upon high-quality sources of "scrap" metal to work on in the first place. It's a good way to recycle steel. It's not a great primary source.

[12:58:39] <MizMahem> Okay yeah glanced at it, direct reduction of ore and then an electric arc furnace, as I thought.
[13:01:57] <JakeSays> MizMahem: are they mining the ore using electric mining tools powered by fossil free electricity?
[13:02:07] <JakeSays> same as the arc furnace
[13:02:17] <JakeSays> *also the arc furnace
[13:02:19] <MizMahem> I dunno, don't really care TBH.
[13:02:41] <JakeSays> fair enough
[13:03:22] <MizMahem> "solutions" are going to just follow the dollar. Which is kinda why I don't really give two fucks about the subject. People like to talk about like they are interested in doing something  about it, but I think few people actually want to pay the hard prices that would come.
[13:03:57] <MizMahem> If Germany or whoever starts to mandate that steel production use this, then german companies will just buy even *more* steel from China instead.
[13:04:43] <MizMahem> And if they slap a tariff or whatever on Chinese steel (unlikely) well the price of German steel goods just go up
[13:04:53] <MizMahem> repeat this song and dance for just about everything
[13:05:37] *** Joins: tsujp (~tsujp@sourcehut/user/tsujp)
[13:05:56] <Nasp> Nobody is willing to pay the price that's why politician fears making mandates about it
[13:06:06] <Nasp> Esepcially against the industries, it's easier to do against citizens
[13:06:07] <MizMahem> which is why I don't really care. We could, fairly easily, cut CO2 emissions by a lot by just like, raising fuel prices by 25-50%. But that trickles down to just about everything, and when people find out that like, everything in their life cost 25-50% more, they will be seriously unhappy.
[13:06:18] <tsujp> if I have a bunch of methods that all have the same check at the top of them i.e. like they all do `if (someParam % 2 == 0) return false` can I make an annotation that instead does that or should I abstract it into a function call at the top of those methods instead?
[13:06:22] <MizMahem> (and unemployed and recessions and and and...)
[13:06:26] <tsujp> What's the most C#-y way of getting that solved
[13:06:38] <MizMahem> so people talk and talk and talk but actual action be slow
[13:06:45] <Nasp> MizMahem:  Yeah incfrease fuel prices like that and you start a civil war
[13:07:07] <Nasp> You can't make an annotation
[13:07:15] <Nasp> What is it exactly checking?
[13:07:21] <MizMahem> tsujp: I just use some guard methods. Sec.
[13:07:28] <Nasp> Or validate it instead
[13:07:45] <MizMahem> this is a library I like for it: https://github.com/safakgur/guard
[13:07:54] <tsujp> MizMahem that wont work, retail petrol price is THE canonical example of a price-inelasticity
[13:08:01] <Cecen> Hmm we suggested letting a diversity hire go because she's low key really stupid and hasn't improved in over a year and now our diversity department is trying to suggest we're being mysogynistic
[13:08:04] <Cecen> I hate 2021
[13:08:10] <Nasp> But that guard library does exactly the same as if (some param)
[13:08:33] <MizMahem> well the library throws, so if you want to early return, not useful to you I suppose.

[13:10:15] <MizMahem> tell people they can "do their part" to reduce climate change by going on fewer trips, using less electricity, buying less stuff, and eating less meat, and they look at you like you be crazy.
[13:10:35] <MizMahem> "ME!? Do something about climate change!? THAT IS FOR THE GOVERNMENT MIZ, NOT FOR ME."
[13:11:22] <MizMahem> "Find a way to reduce global industrial activity without affecting my life in any way, please and thank you."
[13:11:25] <tsujp> Cecen I get trying to hire people from unprivileged backgrounds but only if it's based on their merit the same as others, like if you're ONLY hired because of your skin or gender you could imagine being that person: the only reason they were hired wasn't because of their ability but rather something they were born with or what they identify as,
[13:11:25] <tsujp> i.e. they have no value beyond that. What people should be doing is going "how can we make sure that we are, in addition to seeing our normal applicants, making sure we are checking for applicants from XYZ underrepresented regions"

[13:14:34] <tsujp> I used to own bloat.software I think it was
[13:14:39] <tsujp> I had it redirect to windows 10 home page
[13:14:46] <Nasp> Everywhere it seems to be an OEM license and tied to motherboard
[13:14:57] <tsujp> OEM tired to motherboard? lmfao
[13:14:59] <Nasp> I kinda dont want to buy a new one each time i buy a new machine
[13:15:10] <MizMahem> Nasp: the keywords you want to search for is "Windows 10 FPP" I believe.
[13:15:13] <tsujp> im 99% sure you get like 5 HW changes or something like that within a period of time
[13:15:23] <tsujp> and if not u just call them and go "oi ive changed my machine let me get a HWID reset please"
[13:15:33] <Nasp> My previous win 10 license is tied to the old machine that's in pieces in a box now
[13:15:44] <tsujp> try and use it, then call the support number
[13:16:01] <Nasp> I gave up on taht, that's why im looking for a new one
[13:16:37] <tsujp> I bought windows 8 which then became 8.1 (free, and on a new machine) which then became 10 (free, and on a new machine) and when I rebuilt my pc and activated it for the 4th time I got expired called them and explained I had a new machine hence the new activation and they reset it or whatever and hey presto still using the same 8.1 key 4 machines
[13:16:38] <tsujp> later
[13:16:51] <tsujp> I mean the number isn't some phone-menu one it's direct to a rep
[13:17:12] <tsujp> it kinda sucks in that you need to repeat to them some like 50 character code the windows activation thing spits out but beyond that it took me literally 5 minutes
[13:18:37] <tsujp> buy a new key if you want but what im saying is unless you buy say a laptop which includes windows (because im not aware of the general rules there) if you have a key you bought as just the key you are allowed to use it over N machines over T time period, and you just call them to extend that if you have a valid reason
[13:18:47] <tsujp> "box in pieces" is a valid reason because it was a valid reason for me
[13:19:01] <Nasp> Yeah like i said i can't
[13:19:10] <Nasp> Not even sure what the key is, it's an upgraded on an upgraded on an upgrade
[13:19:13] <tsujp> You didn't say you can't you said you gave up
[13:19:13] <Nasp> I think it's original a vista key
[13:19:24] <Nasp> Yeah i gave up on it
[13:19:33] <tsujp> Mine was an upgrade on an upgrade on an upgrade 8 -> 8.1 -> 10 -> 10 again
[13:19:38] <tsujp> Gave up != can't
[13:20:43] <tsujp> Just.. open windows activation, enter the key, click the prompts, when it spits out the phone number call them
[13:21:01] <MizMahem> it sounds like you are talking about the MAK key activation process, I'm not sure that's applicable here. If they have an OEM key, it's not going to be transferable like that.
[13:21:06] <tsujp> Heck, do it while you browser for alternate solutions
[13:21:35] <Nasp> Fuck it, i just pirated it again

[13:22:43] <bomb> a little slow but OK
[13:22:47] <tsujp> just don't activate it too can't you use it without needing to
[13:23:02] <tsujp> id rather do that that download the crack-only exe from some torrent
[13:23:11] <tsujp> that than*
[13:24:09] <Nasp> tsujp:  Yes
[13:25:27] <tsujp> remember you need to delete system32 or microsoft will kick down your door

[13:29:12] <bomb> lol
[13:29:26] <tsujp> how does the windows 11 WSL2 gui stuff work? like you can now run linux apps from WSL2 and the gui shows up in windows desktop environment. Is it just X11 forwarding?
[13:29:41] <bomb> just pray Windows won't find a way to enable it on its own
[13:30:02] <tsujp> OS editing the BIOS/UEFI firmware? Sounds spooky

[13:30:19] <bomb> it's Microsoft though
[13:30:24] <Nasp> Its kinda strange
[13:30:44] <tsujp> I'm fairly certain it's impossible since the BIOS/UEFI is loaded before the bootloader
[13:31:08] *** Joins: phrosty (~phrosty@c-73-225-175-19.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)
[13:31:56] <tsujp> Like if you could edit the BIOS/UEFI from your OS then secure boot etc is useless because you can just include code in the bootloader or OS that disables it so that on the next boot secure boot is disabled
[13:31:59] <Nasp> You probably can, you can edit many BIOS settinsg through windows
[13:32:01] <tsujp> and all kinds of fuckery like that
[13:32:07] <Nasp> Right maybe TPM can't
[13:32:13] <Nasp> But other stuff certainly can
[13:32:18] <tsujp> O.o
[13:32:29] <Suchiman> tsujp: it's at least partially possible, I remember UEFIs getting corrupted by variables being set from the os
[13:32:39] <tsujp> Sweet mary mother of christ

[13:34:29] <tsujp> which folder do I have to delete to stop that? syswow64?
[13:35:05] <Suchiman> ntoskrnl.exe
[13:35:15] <tsujp> Gotcha, thanks
[13:35:58] <Nasp> Can't you still update the entire bios from windows?
[13:36:05] <Nasp> Not sure if manufactueres still allows that
[13:36:11] <Nasp> ahh Suchiman  sad so
[13:36:12] <Suchiman> Nasp: that's what I said xD
[13:36:14] <Nasp> Right i rememberm y dell doing it
[13:36:14] <tsujp> Not if you delete ntoskrnl.exe so there's a known workaround
[13:36:20] <Nasp> And TPM is getting enabled by default now
[13:36:58] <MizMahem> you can certianly edited some UEFI components via the OS. Like, to a degree that's the point. Booloader checks some signs on some code, and you are good to go.

[21:25:17] <MichaelLong> MaNa2k, I don't know: if you just want to familiarize with EF go for it. I was using it a couple of years ago - so not really compareable to todays version - I didn't liked it. It felt overly complex and to abstracted from the db. We resorted to dapper instead.
[21:25:18] <MaNa2k> hmm
[21:25:38] <MaNa2k> ah dapper
