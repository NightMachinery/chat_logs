[00:00:40] <ljharb> you sound like you think this is a bad thing tho
[00:00:48] <ljharb> 2fa is great
[00:01:18] <ljharb> and if you're publishing anything and don't require 2fa for it, then you're definitely guaranteeing that if a security incident happens, it'll be all your fault
[00:01:56] <sheetjs> there was an issue last year with the entire registry

[03:58:17] <web499> because the tutorials are outdated.
[03:58:19] <ljharb> web499: node comes first
[03:58:24] <ljharb> and yes, most tutorials on the web are outdated
[03:58:30] <ljharb> web499: also, don't use apt to install node.
[03:58:57] <ljharb> web499: you can change the port without nginx. it's just that by the time things get to production, they're usually behind nginx and not just node exposed directly.
[03:59:00] <web499> node.js first, then express because express runs on top of node?
[03:59:35] <ljharb> yes
[03:59:52] <ljharb> then long before you get mongo set up, or use react, get a node webserver that's listening to requests.
[04:00:30] <web499> ok so, node.js, express, react, mongo or postgres. in that order?
[04:01:57] <systemfault> Normally, you would install node and Mongo (order does not matter) then the rest
[04:02:26] <ljharb> sure
[04:02:33] <ljharb> but i'm suggesting you figure out how node works before you get into mongo
[04:02:50] <ljharb> web dev is one of the hardest kinds of dev there is, and you can't just jump into it from one tutorial
[04:03:00] <web499> this tutorial i see says mongo, node, react then express.

[04:07:02] <ljharb> ^ that
[04:07:13] <systemfault> web499: See it as an optimization.
[04:07:18] <ljharb> web499: a high level understanding doesn't mean you can build an app.
[04:07:31] <systemfault> web499: You don't need nginx to write your application.
[04:08:41] <web499> so i am only going to use nginx to change the port to 443.but when the users go to the website they just type foodapp.com and their browser will redirect them to https://foodapp.com. they won't see the port number or anything. do i have that correct?
[04:08:44] <systemfault> Once your application is "done" then you could google about how to use nginx as a proxy to serve your assets instead of an express static asset endpoint

[04:10:43] <systemfault> web499: Because building an application and deploying it are two different steps.
[04:10:53] <systemfault> Like I said, nginx is more like an optimization
[04:11:29] <web499> if you need nginx to change the port to 443 i would say its more of a necessitiy?

[04:37:19] <onosendi> web499: you're talking about installing and setting up a database, an nginx server, and everything else. At that point, you'd be better off getting a vhost at linode/digital ocean for $5/month. AWS is expensive.
[04:37:52] <KevinX> nextjs will autogenerate routes, generate static pages, hydrate pages, optimize images, etc (a lot more)
[04:38:08] <web499> that was my last concern. i figured out how to spin a ec2 ubuntu instance. but i dont know how much it would cost me on aws.
[04:38:33] <web499> that being said if i could just use vercel, netlify, heroku or layer0 and they'll handle all the dev-ops stuff for me that would be better.
[04:38:38] <KevinX> linode and digital ocean are also DIY
[04:38:46] <systemfault> Who knows what will be the AWS prices in 6 months with the current inflation :P
[04:39:27] <onosendi> web499: but you'd still need a database hosted somewhere. NextJS/Vercel is basically your 'ERN' of MERN.
[04:39:29] <web499> i basically started with hostinger a regular hosting website. but then i realized the only server side language i could use was php and php syntax is ugly.
[04:40:19] <web499> i also wanted an excuse to learn javascript, yeah.
[04:42:12] <web499> it kind of makes me think why regular shared cpanel hosting still exist if you have to use PHP as a server side language. most static websites have at least some element where they have to use a server side language to handle login, etc.
[04:43:10] <KevinX> lots of people want a website but dont want to make one
[04:43:24] <KevinX> cpanel makes it easy for hosting companies to provide that
[04:43:36] <KevinX> it's easy to find a php developer too
[04:44:05] * Maxdamantus wishes he hadn't deleted his freewebs site.
[04:44:09] <web499> kevinX have you ever heard of a web app using new tech like mern also having a cpanel?
[04:44:56] <KevinX> cpanel can be installed anywhere but it's mainly for shared hosting environments
[04:45:30] <KevinX> cant think of any shared host that would install node
[04:46:43] <systemfault> Colocations/Virtualhosts (Apache initially) are one of the reasons why PHP became big

[04:48:16] *** Quits: LiftLeft (~LiftLeft@38.123.199.93) (Max SendQ exceeded)
[04:48:21] <web499> why won't shared hosting environments let you install node or install it for you? they said i could only use react, figures because its just a bunch of javascript files?
[04:48:38] <web499> client side javascript files***?

[04:49:42] *** Quits: LiftLeft (~LiftLeft@38.123.199.93) (Max SendQ exceeded)
[04:50:04] <KevinX> Well react runs in the browser's JS runtime, and node is a JS runtime on the server
[04:50:10] *** Joins: LiftLeft (~LiftLeft@38.123.199.93)
[04:50:26] <KevinX> They don't want you messing with the server typically
[04:50:44] <KevinX> You would need to pay for your own sandboxed space
[04:50:51] <web499> eh yeah that makes sense. i terminated like 5 aws instances already messing up.
[04:51:31] <ario> i haven't heard the term cpanel since 1999
[04:51:48] <ario> where am i?!
[04:52:03] <KevinX> i cant remember the last time I saw one

[04:59:03] <web499> i am currently doing things that are way different then web dev.
[04:59:12] <KevinX> these courses will teach you how to build a site from start to finish in a real enough flow

[07:34:23] <systemfault> Your target is to cover 99.8
[07:34:29] <systemfault> *99.9%
[07:34:45] <sheetjs> if you went with 70% it would just be chrome
[07:35:24] <velix> ah... gotcha
[07:35:26] <velix> sorry.
[07:36:46] <velix> So "last 2 major versions, not dead" still has some browsers, which don't support const.

[08:16:33] <velix> Wow, webpack really seems to be widely used according to NPM stats.
[08:17:48] <systemfault> Duh.
[08:18:18] <systemfault> I guess that rollup would be a close second? (Haven't checked)
[08:18:28] <systemfault> Because rails uses it IIRC...
[08:18:57] <SpiceMan> rails is still a thing?
[08:19:26] <systemfault> I guess so, never used it personally.
[08:19:32] <velix> I think many projects are just stuck on webpack and migrating is pretty much work.
[08:19:45] <systemfault> velix: There's no alternative at the moment.
[08:19:50] <velix> systemfault: esbuild?
[08:19:59] <velix> or is it still instable?
[08:20:00] <systemfault> It has all the plugins webpack has?
[08:20:05] <velix> ok no ;)
[08:20:15] <velix> but I mean, for new projects.
[08:20:22] <velix> but sure, plugins ...
[08:20:46] <systemfault> Ecosystem matters... that's why Express is still used despite it being an outdated PoS
[08:21:48] <systemfault> Nothing ever beat jQuery because of all the plugins.. (Yes, I know that its plugin system is poop)
[08:21:59] <velix> downloads of webpack ~ 14 million, followed by rollup ~ 4 million a month, followed by esbuild ~ 2 million a month
[08:22:02] <neshpion> rails is still hip... T_T

[09:20:53] <ljharb> that explains browsers, but not ESM
[09:21:02] <ljharb> (but also, working bundlers automatically replace `fs` with an empty object)
[09:21:09] <ljharb> sheetjs: so, first, "main" points to CJS, and "browser" points to a browser version of the main
[09:21:35] <sheetjs> browser is already some webpack-specific thing

[09:22:17] <ljharb> not webpack-specific.
[09:22:20] <sheetjs> oh
[09:22:28] <ljharb> and in browser, you'd add a key for the "main" file, and point that to the browser one.
[09:22:42] <ljharb> sheetjs: then, "exports" is an object (note that adding "exports" is ALWAYS a breaking change). it should have `./package.json` keyed to itself, and `"."` as an array, with two items - an object, and the "main". the object has three keys: "import" keyed to ESM, "browser" keyed to the browser one, and "default" keyed to the "main".

[12:34:50] <stagas> everywhere i see they're all talking about using useState, useReducer and such, with most of the solutions being problematic, sometimes won't trigger etc, so i wanted to see if there's a canonical way to tell a component to rerender other than it being a side effect of some other variable changing

[12:42:26] <SpiceMan> uhm. I never cared to look how they do it. I would check what the hell mobx' useObserver() does
[12:42:42] <stagas> i guess i can use useState to workaround but clearly there is a mechanism that it is implemented on top of which the setter is using, wondering why it isn't exposed to the user at least not obvious
[12:42:55] <SpiceMan> it's their hook to handle updating when you are state managing with mobx

[18:53:42] <no_gravity> I often wonder what is a good way to have multiline text in js code.

[18:53:51] <no_gravity> https://jsfiddle.net/bLvye1u2/
[18:54:08] <no_gravity> ...The leading newline and the spaces at the beginning of each line are annoying.
