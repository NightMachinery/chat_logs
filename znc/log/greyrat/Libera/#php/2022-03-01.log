[00:53:54] <znf> I need to find all array keys of the form 'actionX' where the values are 'deliver', and then I need to get the coresponding 'destX' from this https://pastie.dev/lSRexr.json -- For the first part I can just array_search(), ofc, but how would I simply find the corresponding 'dest' key? Would a regex (to extract the number) be my only way?
[00:54:38] <znf> ...or maybe just str_replace action with dest

[00:57:55] <da_wunder> why don't you just convert that to an array and then do what you need ?
[00:58:24] <znf> the input?
[00:59:18] <znf> I have no way of changing the input that I get
[00:59:23] <da_wunder> yep, your input is json, so just use json_decode and voila you have stdClass or an array depending what options you use with that function
[00:59:43] <znf> er?
[00:59:55] <znf> I'm not following you
[01:00:22] <znf> yes, I am obviously converting that to an array, and I do what I have to do against args[]
[01:03:24] <da_wunder> so you want to change that input somehow?
[01:03:31] <znf> no?
[01:03:43] <znf> Sorry, which part I didn't explain? :)
[01:03:46] <znf> properly*
[01:05:16] <da_wunder> there isn't `dest` key so quite hard to understand what you want to with that input...
[01:06:21] <znf> each actionX has a coresponding destX
[01:06:24] <znf> action1, dest1
[01:06:26] <znf> action2, dest2
[01:06:28] <znf> action3, dest3
[01:10:35] <da_wunder> that format is really stupid for that
[01:11:31] <da_wunder> you've actionremove[1-3}, actionadd{1-3} - it would be so much easier if there was just action type which tells if that is add or remove
[01:14:07] *** Quits: guido (~weechat@host-79-26-255-224.retail.telecomitalia.it) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[01:15:22] <znf> it is, but I have no control over it
[01:15:55] <da_wunder> but maybe something like this - https://3v4l.org/NjFQr ?
[01:17:30] <znf> X can be anything, not just 1, 2, 3 :P
[01:19:23] <znf> there's no inherent limitation that I can find in the docs that limit the number of actions
[01:21:32] <da_wunder> your example shows just 1, 2 and 3 - so I made that example on that use case
[01:22:05] <da_wunder> now you should know how to make that to cover any use case - right?
[01:23:03] <znf> I guess
[01:33:44] <__adrian> "znf> each actionX has a coresponding destX" "da_wunder> that format is really stupid for that"  // right - to the point that i would say, convert the input first, and then write sensible code next.
[01:43:00] <da_wunder> first normalize your input and after that process that as you like
[01:44:46] <da_wunder> and that "normalizing" here is just to extract those each 1, 2, 3, x to an array that you process after - and that array could be just simple array of arrays OR array of DTOs that you use

[06:23:42] <Nekomander> shailangsa, the thing is, unless your PHP setup is trivial, you're going to need more than xampp.
[06:24:59] <Nekomander> For example, setting up a Virtual Machine with the goal of ensuring everyone on the development team has the same setup (no windows vs mac vs windows nonsense), and it's a better way to set up a dev environment that matches production.
[06:25:50] <Nekomander> Then there are folks who uses vagrant, docker, and make use of provisioners such as Ansible, puppet, chef, etc.
[06:27:50] <shailangsa> do you mean setting up a virtual machine with a cpanel server, just want to use git while working on php files though
[06:32:29] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[06:49:04] <znf> you'd be better off with WSL2 or just a virtual machine
[06:49:19] <znf> You will not get cPanel up on a private VM, as it needs licensing (even for trial)
[06:49:46] <znf> which gets complicated if you have a dynamic IP address @ home (or wherever you develop)
[06:50:27] <znf> if you lack the skills to administer a linux server, then I suggest one of the dozens free control panels

[08:50:22] <TML> shailangsa: Most of the time, the server you deploy to won't be anythign at all like the setup you have in XAMPP, and having that large gap between the local development system and the production system just leads to problems.
[08:51:23] <TML> shailangsa: So most people prefer to use tools like those Nekomander suggested in order to get a virtual environment on their local machine which will mimic as closely as possible the environment they'll eventually have to deploy in

[15:39:38] <NakedKing> Why other logic not works after return? In this case i want to $status for get its value on another function via $this->status. But the code stops after see first return. I need another logic too after if block. Please check https://kopy.io/L3SH6
[15:40:51] <Naktibalda> because that's how return works
[15:40:56] <AllenJB> $this->status refers to a class property. You cannot reference normal variables in a function from other functions.

[15:41:59] <freeman_h> const is define at compile time where as define is defines at run time. I still dont 100% understand the major differences between the 2(define & const) and when it is good or bad to use them

[21:00:42] <The_Blode> Thanks da_wunder checking
[21:02:15] <The_Blode> It's printing <?php phpinfo(); ?>
[21:02:36] <The_Blode> I regularly face this problem and some of my workarounds; apt-get update && upgrade...sometimes works. sudo reboot also.
[21:02:43] <da_wunder> ok, so that tells that you've not enabled mod php
[21:02:51] <__adrian> php isn't running (or isn't passing that file to php)
[21:02:58] <__adrian> what did you name that file
[21:03:09] <The_Blode> Yeah PHP isn't running but apache2 is as the page is reachable.
[21:03:14] <The_Blode> Just info.php
[21:03:25] <__adrian> k
[21:03:29] <da_wunder> so something like `sudo a2emod php` should do the trick
[21:03:30] <The_Blode> I don't know how to jumpstart PHP
[21:03:35] <The_Blode> Thanks. Trying.
[21:03:41] <da_wunder> also you need to restart apache after that
[21:03:47] <Naktibalda> if you use mod_php, PHP is not a separate process, it is part of apache
[21:03:52] <The_Blode> I'm in Debian.
[21:04:19] <__adrian> yeah, it all depends on how you installed, how your OS packaged, etc.
[21:04:23] <Naktibalda> how did you install PHP?
[21:04:43] <The_Blode> I used apt
[21:04:44] <da_wunder> so then just `sudo apt-get install php libapache-mod-php`, `sudo a2emod php` and `sudo service apache2 restart`
[21:05:42] <The_Blode> php info.php works as expected though.
[21:05:54] <The_Blode> On the terminal
[21:06:06] <Naktibalda> because that's what you installed
[21:08:06] <The_Blode> Some update to PHP was applied. Rebooting.

[21:16:41] <da_wunder> I would recommend you to look - https://stitcher.io/ - site and specially those posts like "What's new in PHP x.y"
[21:16:43] <Naktibalda> some companies consider verison not ready for adoption until it is in security support phase.
[21:17:11] <The_Blode> Thanks da_wunder
[21:17:18] <__adrian> heh. i guess... but that's definitely not how php releases work  :)
[21:17:28] <The_Blode> I have a deprecation scanner installed somewhere which I'll use to scan
[21:17:51] <The_Blode> I went from 5 to 7 and now to 8
[21:17:57] <__adrian> in the php world, "security support" is a "final warning" that you really need to be working on that upgrade, like, NOW.
[21:18:18] <da_wunder> ^
[21:18:33] <The_Blode> Good point...I actually put it on my boss' radar late last year

[21:20:30] <da_wunder> quite easy task to do because that project is heavily tested with phpunit and we use different SA tools like psalm and phpstan - so there was just couple needed code changes
[21:21:27] <da_wunder> and update process itself is easy because we're using docker on local development and production - so literally just change one line on Dockerfile and Dockerfile_dev and build containers again

[21:44:52] <The_Blode> Actually, da_wunder, that could did not run on my box. PHP threw me an error. Possibly 7.3 issue with that?
[21:45:21] <The_Blode> The error "syntax error, unexpected '=>' (T_DOUBLE_ARROW), expecting ')'
[21:45:28] <__adrian> 7.3 is unsupported, yep. that's an issue.
[21:45:30] <da_wunder> most likely because of that arrow function, which was introduced in php 7.4

[21:57:35] <The_Blode> So I figured it out. I used da_wunder's code to convert to lower, then I repeated the line with the resultant array and trimmed the string, now no dupes.
[21:57:42] <The_Blode> Thank you! I learned something cool today
[21:57:51] <The_Blode> I may aswell delete that old function...it serves no purpose
[21:58:08] <The_Blode> I should look to stock functions before building my own out
[21:59:33] <da_wunder> although var_dump doesn't tell the whole truth always, see this post - https://ocramius.github.io/blog/fast-php-object-to-array-conversion/
[22:00:43] <__adrian> mm. can be unexpected, but...  yeah  :)  don't cast objects as arrays

[22:30:12] <AllenJB> I suggest you try a variety of frameworks and find out what you do and don't like
[22:30:27] <da_wunder> ^
[22:33:52] <The_Blode> Does anybody write PHP by hand without a framework?
[22:34:10] <__adrian> i use my hands even with a framework
[22:34:23] <The_Blode> Gottem
[22:35:00] <da_wunder> that totally depends what you need to do
[22:36:13] <__adrian> consider: this is not a useful question. seems like you're trying to find a reason to not learn how to use a framework. there's no such reason; and generalizing it as "i can write it all from scratch" is just NIH syndrome.
[22:36:43] <__adrian> you should always prefer using existing, well-used, well-supported tools/libraries/frameworks.
[22:37:24] <__adrian> yes, "suited to your needs" but that's usually not a _real_ blocker.

[22:37:43] <The_Blode> I had to Google NIH syndrome
[22:37:53] <__adrian> !+NIH
[22:37:53] <php-bot> [NIH] (or "NIH Syndrome"): See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here
[22:38:08] <The_Blode> I'm learning stuff today
[22:38:11] <__adrian> bascially, "i can" ≠ "i should"
[22:38:28] <The_Blode> I agree with adrian even though I don't use any PHP framework...I really want to.
[22:38:43] <The_Blode> Lots of the frameworks have learning curves so I'm trying to decide which is best for me right now.
[22:38:50] <__adrian> just pick one
[22:38:51] <The_Blode> Code Ignitor seems to be suitable for me.
[22:39:05] <__adrian> just pick [a different] one
[22:39:06] <The_Blode> Just want something lightweight to start with.
[22:39:08] <The_Blode> lol
[22:39:13] <The_Blode> Laravel?
[22:39:58] <__adrian> if you want something "lightweight" you might look at one of the so-called "micro" frameworks. they're generally just routers that let you write your own controller code.
[22:40:08] <__adrian> slim4, lumen, etc.
[22:40:23] <__adrian> but !+recommend due diligence
[22:40:23] <php-bot> but, we recommend you research many, try a few, pick one; rinse and repeat as necessary. see also /msg php-bot recommend
[22:41:03] <da_wunder> or just symfony skeleton - it's small and gives you all goodies like DI, etc.
[22:41:09] <__adrian> point being, don't try _just_ one. especially if you're wanting to learn about frameworks vs. actually finishing some project.
[22:41:24] <da_wunder> + you can add stuff to that if/when you need it
[22:41:47] <__adrian> being able to learn+use (integrate with) third-party tools is a MUCH more valuable skill than just picking one.
[22:41:53] <The_Blode> I have written one app in PHP which I use everyday and it's written by hand as it's bespoke to me...however, I can't help but feel the app would work better in a framework.
[22:41:55] *** Quits: xep (~xep@76-210-4-7.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:42:12] <da_wunder> but yes - try out _multiple_ frameworks to see how those works and then you can compare those and pick the "best" for _your_ use case
[22:42:32] <__adrian> don't go with your feeling. look at your app and find the specific things that might not work well.
[22:42:41] *** Joins: xep (~xep@76-210-4-7.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net)
[22:42:55] <__adrian> else you're likely to just rewrite the same mistakes, but with a framework.
[22:43:30] <The_Blode> It's a task logger app
[22:43:48] <The_Blode> It's sitting at around 7k lines
[22:44:14] <The_Blode> It has a massive case switch statement with 664 branching paths
[22:44:42] <da_wunder> that itself is quite big red flag
[22:44:51] <The_Blode> It's quite smelly yes
[22:44:56] <__adrian> yes
[22:45:05] <__adrian> but doesn't mean that "framework" is the solution
[22:45:11] <The_Blode> How would you approach it?
[22:45:16] <__adrian> you can write just-as-bad things with a framework
[22:45:49] <__adrian> like i said, sit down and review it critically. make a list of the things that don't work well / you don't like, and why.
[22:46:04] <__adrian> like, actual list. write it down on paper.
[22:46:11] <da_wunder> the "proper" way to make that, is quite hard to say - because we don't know what you're trying to do and we don't see your actual code
[22:46:40] <The_Blode> I've been embarking on an optimization process for about a year now to trim the codebase down. It was over 10k lines but reduced to 7k through removal of non-optimized code
[22:48:22] <The_Blode> Well, imagine a list of tasks that you do everyday. Put them in a HTML form as list items. When you click each item, they are sent to PHP and PHP will log them. The caveat is, the tasks can vary in scope, measurement, detail etc
[22:49:07] <The_Blode> I figured indexing the list items and checking them against a big case switch statement to determine how to log
[22:49:29] <The_Blode> There's no DB here.
[22:49:41] <The_Blode> Which is a big issue really
[22:51:12] <da_wunder> ok, so you have "tasks", so I would create first interface for "TaskHandler" which could have methods like `supports` and `process` - and then you make different classes for each task, create collection about those task services - and when you have task "x" you iterate that task service list and call that support method first and if that "task" is supported then call that `process` method and so on
[22:51:31] <da_wunder> and that is just _one_ way to do that
[22:51:49] <The_Blode> That's interesting...but that is a design change. It's using classes.
[22:51:57] <The_Blode> Which is the proper way of programming it.
[22:52:14] <The_Blode> Each task has it's own properties and maybe it's own class.
[22:53:12] <The_Blode> Thanks for that da_wunder
[22:53:58] <da_wunder> if task is own class then it will be quite easy to implement that `support` method, it could be just something like `function supports(BaseTask $task): boolean { return $task instanceof SomeSpecialTask; }`
[22:54:42] <The_Blode> That could reduce a huge amount of code. I will look into this when I have some free time! Thank you!
[22:54:48] <The_Blode> It's my little side project in my spare time
[22:55:26] <da_wunder> but once again - that is just _one_ way to do that - that was just first idea that I got when you explained your application
[22:55:42] <The_Blode> I guess I'm not too versed in OOP so just apprehensive but I guess it's the proper way to approach it.

[23:21:39] <Alex123> Hello All, In php is there way to use annotation or other to mark required properties required?
[23:21:48] <__adrian> iterators were a pre-generator idea for the same problem

[23:22:04] <stenno> i see
[23:22:10] <__adrian> Alex123: "required" for what?
[23:22:46] <__adrian> stenno: though generators are more flexible and can be applied to other problems as well
[23:22:56] <stenno> yeah they seem superior
[23:23:03] <__adrian> the whole passing-of-control thing
[23:23:16] <stenno> maybe when i talked about 'generators lacking in php' yesterday, i looked at those iterators instead of the generator stuff
