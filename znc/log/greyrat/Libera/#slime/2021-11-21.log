[20:19:21] <phantomics> Hi, anyone here have experience using ABCL through Slime? I've tried setting environment variables via the :env property when setting up multiple Slime CL implementations, but it doesn't work, the environment variables aren't available when running shell commands via (uiop:run-program)

[21:28:50] <pjb> phantomics: that should work, AFAIK from the documentation. But indeed, it doesn't seem to work.  The other environment variables are passed ok, but not those added here. :-(
[21:32:11] <phantomics> pjb: I'm sure it has something to do with the mechanics of ABCL running in Java
[21:35:28] <pjb> I'd rather expect a bug in slime. I tried to add another configuration to slime-lisp-implementations to test with ccl, and I couldn't use it (it doesn't find my implementation symbol, and tries to run it as a command…
[21:41:06] <phantomics> Did you use M-- M-x?
[21:41:18] <phantomics> I'm using several different impls with Slime
[21:50:53] <pjb> phantomics: yes. C-u M-x slime RET test-ccl RET  or C-u M-x slime RET abcl RET
[21:51:50] <phantomics> Hmm, for me M-- M-x slime RET ccl RET works, or test-ccl or whatever other name you give it
[21:53:27] <pjb> phantomics: but you're right, C-u M-x slime  does something else. I've been wrong all the time…
[21:53:41] <pjb> With M-- M-x slime it works for my ccl test with the :env.
[21:54:01] <phantomics> Good
[21:54:18] <pjb> and it works with abcl too.
[21:54:33] <phantomics> Really? Maybe I should update my Slime
[21:54:53] <phantomics> What version of Slime are you using?
[21:55:06] <pjb> I have Version: 2.26.1
[21:55:26] <pjb> and abcl "1.8.0" "OpenJDK_64-Bit_Server_VM-Eclipse_Adoptium-11.0.13+8" "x86_64-Mac_OS_X-11.6"
[21:56:32] <phantomics> I have the same
[21:57:47] <phantomics> Except I have a different JDK and I'm not on OSX, I'll try updating it
