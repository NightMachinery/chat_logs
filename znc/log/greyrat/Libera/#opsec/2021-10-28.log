[04:38:07] <ilikeyou> hey hey
[04:46:26] <ilikeyou> peeps, I need an up to date authentic version of Excel for work. Do people REALLY pay for it?
[05:06:33] <mooff> torrenting Excel would probably NOT be recommended in this channel
[05:07:24] <vaio> if it's for work, can't you ask your boss for a license ?
[05:07:26] <vaio> also, hi
[05:07:43] <mooff> a bit like how you wouldn't recommend to leave a PS5 in the middle of a room with curtains open and the lights on at night, with the front door unlocked, and nobody at home, to someone in #homesecurity
[05:11:35] <mooff> or recommend not to wear seatbelts in #lifespan
[05:12:01] <ilikeyou> for side work. i'm trying to avoid the monthly subscription thing.
[05:12:17] <ilikeyou> i'm not a windoze guy :(
[05:12:20] <mooff> do you really need Excel?
[05:12:27] <ilikeyou> yes
[05:12:33] <ilikeyou> true blue excel
[05:12:49] <mooff> is that a web app these days?
[05:13:13] <ilikeyou> it is. i could prob get by with that 
[05:13:25] <ilikeyou> just exploring options
[05:13:43] <mooff> i'd just pay for it. add the cost to your price for side work
[05:13:50] <mooff> or, eat the cost for your side work
[05:14:14] <ilikeyou> fair enough
[05:14:37] <mooff> otherwise you're whoring your privacy / security for (relatively) small change
[05:15:05] <mooff> Google Sheets won't cut it?
[05:15:57] <ilikeyou> no. i need to pass it off after i handle my part 
[05:16:16] <mooff> Google Sheets can download to .xlsx
[05:16:23] <mooff> and share to other google accounts
[05:16:57] <mooff> it might not be flawless exporting to xlsx, but it should work
[05:18:19] <ilikeyou> i'll take a look at it though. thanks
[05:20:20] <mooff> np. gl
