[16:24:22] <xx> yes, it works now, thank, I thought I edited a file but instead I accidentally created a new file with a typo
[16:27:32] <xx> why does the default formats " (%s)-[%b]%u%c-" have the - at the end anyway? Just curious.
[16:29:31] <danielsh> No idea.  It's been this way since ft's first version back in 2008
[16:30:01] <Mikachu> probably in his prompt, he has other things after this, and everything is separated by dashes
[16:30:15] <Mikachu> it's just an example, after all
[16:31:16] <xx> ok
[16:31:21] <xx> all looks good now, thanks again
[16:31:24] <danielsh> it's not "just an example", it's the default
[16:31:32] <danielsh> it's what everyone gets in their fresh docker instances and so on
[16:31:43] <danielsh> cheers
[16:32:00] <xx> exactly, that's why I looked into the formats in the first place, the trailing - looked weird, as if something was missing
[16:32:09] <Mikachu> maybe that's the intent
[16:32:17] <Mikachu> irssi has purposefully bad defaults to make you read the docs :)
[16:32:31] <xx> that's horrifying, but I kind of get that

[16:34:02] <Mikachu> ah, indeed it was removed in march 2002
[16:34:07] <Mikachu> -    info = " Irssi v$J - http://irssi.org/beginner/ - read it to get rid of this";
[16:34:42] <danielsh> sigh
[16:34:59] <Mikachu> (i was just joking about it being the intent of the - btw)
[16:35:09] <danielsh> if I were a downstream maintainer of that I'd have been tempted to replace that URL with https://weechat.org/ :P 
[16:35:15] <Mikachu> hehe
[16:35:28] <Mikachu> i don't think weechat existed in 2002
[16:35:33] <danielsh> anyway, vcs_info does have some bells and whistles that are off by default,
[16:36:07] <danielsh> e.g., the "original commit" info during rebases
[16:36:08] <xx> that's fine, I am actually reading through the docs, and now realize what I did wrong before
[16:37:44] <Mikachu> btw, if you're using it in your prompt, you may want to use a specific style for it
[16:38:00] <Mikachu> eg, if you pass an argument to vcs_info, that argument will be used in constructing the style lookup
[16:38:09] <Mikachu> this way, it won't interfere with other uses of vcs_info
[16:38:21] <Mikachu> eg,
[16:38:24] <Mikachu> vcs_info prompt-mikachu
[16:38:34] <Mikachu> zstyle ':vcs_info:*:prompt-mikachu:*' actionformats %b %a
[16:38:53] <xx> that's a little bit above my knowledge of zsh for now

[16:40:46] <Mikachu> i don't think you need %f right before a %F
[16:40:49] *** Quits: enkeyz (~enkeyz@user/enkeyz) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[16:41:03] <Mikachu> also your last red/blue isn't converted to put the cond inside the %F
[16:41:24] <Mikachu> looks pretty fancy to me though :)
[16:41:50] <xx> hmm, I thought %f is used as a closing argument to the previous %F
[16:41:57] <xx> but I guess it is not necessary
[16:41:59] <Mikachu> no it just sends the color reset sequence
[16:42:22] <xx> I guess it looks symmetrical to me
[16:42:28] <xx> but let me think about that red/blue thing
[16:42:52] <Mikachu> oh i see why now
[16:42:57] <Mikachu> it's because you have the #$ in there
[16:43:04] <Mikachu> somewhat heretical to use $ in a zsh prompt
[16:43:18] <xx> true :D
[16:43:38] <xx> but I often do screenshots for guides, and people expect to see $ there
[16:44:05] <Mikachu> (actually supporting %() inside %F is pretty "new")
[16:44:28] <Mikachu> supported since 2013 :)
[16:46:56] <danielsh> you don't really need to pass an argument (as in 'vcs_info foo') unless you call vcs_info from more than one place and want different outputs
[16:47:16] <Mikachu> it's pretty easy to do though, and has no downsides
[16:47:29] <danielsh> steepens the learning curve needlessly
[16:47:52] <Mikachu> admittedly it's pretty rare that you'd want to use it interactively
[16:47:55] <danielsh> aren't you the one who told me not to do   set -- foo; for 1 ; print $argv[...]    in an example about something else?
[16:48:01] <danielsh> I do, actually
[16:48:15] <danielsh> I sometimes use it interactively to print the patches stack (from an ongoing rebase or quilt series)
[16:48:21] <Mikachu> if i did, it was probably because of the shortloops usage :)

[16:54:23] <Mikachu> i didn't notice the # and $ being inside the condition at first

[22:29:32] <llua> why does: _foo() { _arguments '1:stuff' '-f[foo]' '-b[bar]' }; compdef _foo foo; unsetopt menucomplete # only shows the describe for the first spec but doesn't attempt to complete options?
[22:30:19] <Mikachu> options are only shown if you type a - yourself first (unless there are no more arguments)
[22:30:34] <llua> you can type that and it still refuses
[22:31:08] <Mikachu> works here (and i already didn't have menucomplete set)
[22:31:47] <llua> hm, do you have auto_menu set?
[22:31:52] <Mikachu> is the implication that it does work for you with menucomplete set?
[22:32:00] <Mikachu> i do
[22:32:09] <llua> yeah, but menu_complete isn't a default nor what i set usually
[22:32:24] <Mikachu> still works with setopt noautomenu
[22:32:50] <Mikachu> but with noautolist it doesn't work anymore
[22:33:03] <Mikachu> it accepts the options if i type them though
[22:33:11] <Mikachu> also if i hit ctrl-d, it lists them
[22:33:21] <Mikachu> which i think is exactly what autolist controls
[22:33:37] <llua> i do disable autolist
[22:33:58] <Mikachu> so if you disable menucomplete and autolist, then the correct behavior is to feep on ambiguous matches without listing anything
[22:34:03] <llua> these are the three options that interact weirdly right?
[22:34:05] <Mikachu> it's not a very useful combination of options in my opinion :)
[22:34:26] <Mikachu> well, there's some more, like bashautomenu or whatever
[22:34:31] <Mikachu> bashautolist
