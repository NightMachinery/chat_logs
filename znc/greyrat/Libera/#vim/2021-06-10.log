[02:30:05] <tomasino> the title comes from the name of the page so you need to "move" it, which on a mediawiki takes admin privileges. you could ask on the "tal/discussion" page, but best bet is to track down an admin and ping them
[02:30:15] <tomasino> talk*
[02:30:32] <rs_> not a good option. I'm interested in this entry because it is among the first results when you type 'vim irc' in several search engines

[03:12:42] <gosukiwi> Hi guys. I want to make a little command/function. I need to receive input, something like `foo app/some/file` for the second part, I'd like to allow file autocomplete, but not for the first part. Is there a way to do that? I know you can give an autocomplete paramter to `input` but that works for a single string. I could use two inputs but I'd
[03:12:42] <gosukiwi> rather do it all in one step if possible.

[10:34:30] <Intelo> ok but how to actually do it?
[10:35:12] <Intelo> the docs says:
[10:35:18] <igemnace> "disable `s` and use <Leader>s instead", look into the plugin documentation first. plugins typically do it two ways: a) allow the user to configure a new mapping, e.g. g:foo_mapping = '<Leader>s' (usually older plugins), or b) allow the user to disable default mappings and expose <Plug> mappings so you can do e.g. nmap <Leader>s <Plug>sneak (usually newer or better plugins)
[10:35:46] <Intelo> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/TQ8Z2Wnvc3/
[10:36:35] <Intelo> Will this disable the mapping? nmap ? <Plug>Sneak_s
[10:36:35] <igemnace> alright. then just map whatever you want to the <Plug> mapping. e.g. nmap <Leader>s <Plug>Sneak_s
[10:36:47] <igemnace> that will literally map it to the ? key

[10:39:13] <igemnace> you need nmap, not nnoremap. you're relying on a recursive behavior to trigger the <Plug>Sneak_s mapping in the first place

[18:24:32] <stutz> yes

[18:25:23] <synthmeat> ~2M pageviews a day. but yeah, lots of them are 1cpu/1gb ram, probably over 60%
[18:25:26] <nicolapcweek94> and in general, why would you want a 100 pi cluster?
[18:25:45] <stutz> all of the official rpi servers run on rpi clusters FWIW nicolapcweek94 
[18:25:45] <lericson> because it's the closest thing to nanobots i can do
[18:25:49] <nicolapcweek94> or any 100 machine cluster really
[18:25:58] <nicolapcweek94> not much software around that could work with that
[18:26:09] <lericson> with a 100+ machine cluster you can start toying with google style solutions like mapreduce and big table
[18:26:10] <stutz> and if there was you'd probably want to use k8s anyway

[21:16:51] <puadxtub> builtin plugin search is not really much a thing, only managers I've seen doing that were VAM (Vim Addon Manager) and Vundle, both dead.
[21:17:29] <bfredl> worst thing that could happen is that google leads to a page how do what you want with builtin functionality.
[21:17:41] <lyndog> How many plugins do most people have out of interest? I have 28 installed but half are syntax highlighting
[21:17:42] <sylario> Ok i thought it would work like that : https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/rlyTLeQk/image.png

[21:19:53] <lyndog> that's fair enough puadxtub, was just curious! Wow that seems like a lot, I know I had bad experience a few years ago running too many and having vim take ages to open simple files.

[21:21:47] <puadxtub> exactly
[21:22:01] <bfredl> some plugins just replace runtime ftplugins with later versions, these are basically "free" unless they do stupid stuff
[21:22:01] <puadxtub> I generally end up eliminating bloated ones.
[21:22:02] <sylario> I am just starting vim but I guess i'll need ruby,rails,JS and CSS plugins, probably something to handle projects too

[21:23:43] <bfredl> I still use the unicode table it provides, but the builtin messup of TAB is no good
[21:23:46] <lyndog> paudxtub: neat! I'll have a look at that one.
[21:24:58] <puadxtub> yep, well, I just disabled whatever they offer with latex2unicode whatever and pick it from LSP client instead.
[21:25:34] <bfredl> I also remember the first days of YCM. I made it active only for c++ as there it was a huge net time saver, otherwise it was just distracting lag everywhere :D
[21:25:36] <puadxtub> worst even they're so much into that stuff that the prefer to keep having conflicts with myriad completers.

[22:09:22] <tomasino> turn off syntax highlighting and see if it's still slow
