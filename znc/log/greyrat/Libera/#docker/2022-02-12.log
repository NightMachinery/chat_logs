[12:29:53] <pgloor> If I understand right, you are using an LXD container which has docker installed? It depends on your needs, you can run your docker containers within this single LXD/LXC container.
[12:30:14] <trumee> pgloor: That is correct
[12:31:35] <trumee> At the moment i have separate LXD containers hooked to different VLAN. I was wondering whether it possible to do the same with docker.
[12:31:36] <pgloor> It can be interesting to run more than one LXD/LXC container with docker, to simulate swarm conditions and the like.

[12:37:26] <pgloor> I don't know how to do this. I use docker containers only on single dev hosts. Ho swarm or k8s. Yesterday it was the first time I tried a docker swarm, but personally I dont have a need for.
[12:37:41] <pgloor> *No
[12:37:59] <trumee> Thanks pgloor
[12:38:19] <trumee> I am more familiar with LXD. Will stick to that.

[21:55:48] <IceMichael> hi guys
[21:56:05] <IceMichael> I have now set up with Vagrant a Linux VM that has docker etc. (because it might be slow with docker desktop on macos, at least I try)
[21:56:15] <IceMichael> what I don't get: apparently vagrant sets up the VM to has docker installed
[21:56:23] <IceMichael> but I also need to have docker-machine locally installed
[21:56:32] <IceMichael> so, is docker-machine just a client to the actual docker?
[21:57:34] <DoofusCanadensis> yeah, you still need a docker client on macos to connect to the VM (which is what Docker Desktop for Mac does as well)
[21:59:45] <IceMichael> hm, ok, so when I run "docker-machine create -d generic", what exactly does it create now? The VM with docker already seems to exist. So this creates a host or just adds a connection or..?
[22:00:34] <IceMichael> help says it creates a "machine", but what is this... maybe I need some architecture overview
[22:00:55] <DoofusCanadensis> off to the docs, then. I'm not familiar with docker-machine myself
[22:02:22] <IceMichael> yeah, my usual process is, I try to find it in docs myself or learn it, then realize, it's not straightforward to understand, then I go to this chat here and ask because people are oftentimes better in explaining than the docs
[22:03:37] <IceMichael> and arch diagrams do only mention docker host but not docker machine
[22:03:58] <IceMichael> they mention "host machine"s but this is not what "docker-machine create" creates
[22:04:37] <DoofusCanadensis> https://docs.docker.com/machine/
[22:04:48] <DoofusCanadensis> according to the documentation, docker-machine is deprecated
[22:04:56] <IceMichael> sure, but there is a maintained fork
[22:05:17] <IceMichael> but I got it now: apparently, docker-machine is just a communication entity to deal with (potentially multiple) docker hosts
[22:05:38] <DoofusCanadensis> 👍
[22:05:43] <IceMichael> diagram up here is nice: https://www.vermasachin.com/posts/7-running-docker-mac/
[22:05:49] <DoofusCanadensis> docker cli is the same
[22:06:26] <IceMichael> the same as what?
[22:06:34] <IceMichael> as machine?
[22:06:47] <IceMichael> so I could use cli instead of machine and also have docker itself in a virtualbox vm or something?
[22:06:53] <DoofusCanadensis> the `docker` cli connects to multiple hosts
[22:06:56] <IceMichael> but I'm still wondering where the docker desktop overhead comes from
[22:07:24] <DoofusCanadensis> macOS does not provide the necessary frameworks for docker to run natively (it requires Linux)
[22:07:25] <IceMichael> yeah, but somehow machine still is needed, it says to have provisioning profiles, so probably not much more than a collection of profiles or something
[22:07:30] <IceMichael> I know
[22:07:44] <IceMichael> but docker desktop for mac has a VM internally, but from what I read, it's quite inefficient
[22:07:55] <DoofusCanadensis> so Docker Desktop runs a qemu VM containing Linux with docker server components installed
[22:08:04] <DoofusCanadensis> I've never noticed
[22:08:19] <IceMichael> the motivation (that I share) is also described here: https://github.com/stenh0use/docker-machine-for-mac
[22:08:33] <IceMichael> that's what I use now, just installed all of it, seems a bit less resource-heavy but not sure why
[22:08:34] <DoofusCanadensis> in your case, you're using vagrant to run a VM with Linux and docker server components installed
[22:08:39] <IceMichael> qemu, hm
[22:08:44] <IceMichael> yes, I do
[22:09:20] <IceMichael> maybe hypervisor has overhead itself not sure
[22:09:37] <DoofusCanadensis> Docker Desktop also provides some extra framework to mount volumes across that VM boundary
[22:10:00] <DoofusCanadensis> does the same thing on windows... runs docker in a VM with extra bits to make it seamless
[22:10:19] <DoofusCanadensis> docker requires Linux
[22:10:28] <DoofusCanadensis> there's no way around that
[22:10:53] <DoofusCanadensis> macOS is not Linux, it's based on BSD Unix
[22:11:05] <DoofusCanadensis> so either you use this project or you use Docker Desktop for Mac
[22:11:20] <DoofusCanadensis> I can't say I've ever noticed performance hits from running it
[22:12:57] <DoofusCanadensis> and, like the project says, you either have Docker Desktop for Mac installed to provide the docker cli or you install docker-cli (from homebrew, say) to get just the client parts to connect to other hosts local or remote, physical or virtual
[22:15:43] <IceMichael> yes, this is all clear, but some benchmarks seem to indicate that just using a vm yourself, forwarding ports, syncing volumes, is faster
[22:16:05] <IceMichael> than using docker desktop, which internally sets up some linux VM
[22:16:15] <IceMichael> so something there is slowing it down and not sure what and why
[22:16:21] <IceMichael> would be interesting to know...
[22:16:34] <IceMichael> performance is not even so much my issue but docker desktop eats away all my RAM on my macbook :/
[22:16:43] <DoofusCanadensis> that's fair... I can only speak from experience and I haven't cared enough to do benchmarks
[22:16:51] <DoofusCanadensis> so configure it to use less?
[22:16:59] <IceMichael> and CPU
[22:17:25] <IceMichael> seems obvious yes
[22:17:42] <IceMichael> but apparently still some RAM overhead as I read (and tried out). Maybe setting the default option to use less RAM would work
[22:18:52] <DoofusCanadensis> mine is configured to use 4 CPUs and 2GB RAM... no idea if that's default or not
[22:20:03] <IceMichael> hmm okay, thanks for the data
[22:20:43] <DoofusCanadensis> I have 8 and 16 on this M1 MacBook
[22:21:20] <IceMichael> M1 is anyway superior :) I have a shitty 2019 intel one and there are even some additional hardware bugs involved
[22:21:21] <DoofusCanadensis> and I haven't noticed anything that I'd attribute to performance
[22:21:47] <DoofusCanadensis> initially Docker was super slow on M1 because there was so much amd64 code
