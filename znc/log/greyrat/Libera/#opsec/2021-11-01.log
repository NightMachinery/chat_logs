[15:28:14] <jan6> well, trolling tolerances vary, sometimes a lot
[15:28:38] <Joanna> Then there are several people who don’t like politics of Libera staff and get very angry at me when I try to get them to come here.
[15:30:56] <Joanna> There is a phenomenon I’ve noticed with irc channels. It’s when they start to get to be successful, people who have been inactive or polite for months often suddenly turn into trolls and destroy whatever pleasant conversation is happening.
[15:32:03] <Joanna> Has anyone else ever noticed this?
[15:32:24] <jan6> I'm not sure about "turning", I'd guess they just feel like they can stop being so overly nice, and if someone's annoying them, they can annoy them back
[15:32:35] <jan6> but I've also not experienced that myself, so idk
[15:33:17] <jan6> and there's always the people who just wanna cozy up as "Trusted Person" only to drop their act later
[15:34:03] <Joanna> I used to have a small secret chat channel and it was as if people were sharing accounts. Because the polite person I invited ended up talking like someone from a ghetto lol
[15:35:25] <Joanna> It’s tricky because the only way you can judge people is by what they say and sometimes what they say is just an act.

[22:19:33] <Bitweasil> The /ignore feature works.
[22:19:48] <Bitweasil> IRC culture is certainly a bit more abrasive than some other places, and I'm totally fine with that.

[23:54:57] <CalimeroTeknik> Bitweasil, /ignore works for PM, not in channels, where you're essentially attempting to create a subchannel with /ignore
[23:55:20] <CalimeroTeknik> which doesn't work, because people don't sync their ignore lists in factions in a channel, which would warrant creating more channels anyway
[23:56:12] <Bitweasil> *shrug*  If it's that bad, yeah, new channels get created.
[23:56:22] <Bitweasil> I've not found it to be that much of a problem in the last... shit, 25+ years?
[23:57:45] <CalimeroTeknik> do you really use /ignore at all?
[23:58:40] <CalimeroTeknik> (I surely don't, it's more trouble to even bother with it)
