[01:04:53] <evilgohan2> I can't take it off the phone without rooting it...

[01:05:27] <evilgohan2> so...
[01:05:29] <evilgohan2> I simply logged out.

[18:29:39] <rawktucc> youtube is annoying
[18:30:15] <rawktucc> so videos that are SD, under 480 of height, have stream 18 available, which will always have better video bitrate than the separate h264 360p stream
[18:30:31] <rawktucc> this is important if archiving old videos or old channels, because the SD video stream downloaded may infact be worse
[18:36:29] <rawktucc> actually, the -f 18 streams may be even worse than newer lower bitrate videos

[20:46:16] <rawktucc> moo, i made some youtube-dl.conf modifications if you're interested
[20:46:22] <unfinity> ・ ​ ゜゜・。。・゜゜\_​ö< quac​k!
[20:46:42] <moo> i have all working but sure :)
[20:47:27] <rawktucc> add to the .conf
[20:47:42] <rawktucc> --external-downloader "aria2c"
[20:47:43] <rawktucc> --external-downloader-args "-x 16 -s 16 -j 16"
[20:47:54] <rawktucc> if you have fast internet, it will use aria2c and download single file videos ultra fast
[20:48:03] <rawktucc> if the videos are fragmented, it'll download 16 fragments at the same time
[20:48:20] *** Joins: tech_exorcist (txrcst@user/tech-exorcist/x-0447479)
[20:48:20] <rawktucc> this is also my fixed format line
[20:48:23] <rawktucc> -f '(bestvideo*[fps>30][height>1080][vcodec=vp9] / bestvideo*[height>1080][vcodec=vp9] / bestvideo[width>360][vcodec^=avc1] / bestvideo[width<=360][vcodec^=avc1]) + (bestaudio[acodec=opus] / bestaudio)'
[20:48:31] <moo> is it that much better than builtin downloader which also uses 16 downloads in your conf?
[20:48:39] <rawktucc> it can be for big files
[20:48:51] <rawktucc> 2GB 4k video, with built in downloader was 1-10MB/s
[20:48:57] <rawktucc> with aria2c line it downloads at 30-40MB/s or higher
[20:49:06] <moo> oh neat i'll try that
[20:49:11] <rawktucc> worth a try
[20:49:13] <moo> got 1gbps :)
[20:49:25] <rawktucc> so far no issues in terms of videos dying but you can always comment out the lines to stop using aria2c
[20:50:52] <rawktucc> the -f I linked does the following: best video with fps over 60, bigger than 1080p, codec vp9. if unavailable try bigger than 1080p, codec vp9 (so 4k but not 60fps). next is if video is above 360p (so not old SD resolution) grab with h264. if video is equal to or less than 360, grab with h264 (this originally was best, not best video, but im debating whether -f 18 is actually better). finally always grab opus, or if not available (rare but 
[20:50:53] <rawktucc> possible) grab best audio
[20:51:36] <rawktucc> so basically grab 4K 60FPS video in VP9 format, or 4K VP9, or if not 4K grab 1080p in H264, or if not 1080p grab in H264 (or changing bestvideo to best will grab the "best" SD stream, -f 18)
[20:52:57] <moo> it will always ffmpeg to proper mkv right? 
[20:53:01] <moo> container
[20:54:40] *** Joins: dez (uid92154@user/dez)
[21:00:17] <rawktucc> yes it puts video to mkv
[21:02:07] <rawktucc> i dont think you can put the vp9 into mp4 so it has to go to webm or mkv, and some devices wont play webm because they dont recognize it
[21:04:47] <moo> maybe that'll help with rate limiter
