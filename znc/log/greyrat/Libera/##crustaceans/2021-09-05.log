[00:10:51] <gerikson> ``I completely ignored the front end development scene for 6 months. It was fine ''
[00:11:05] <gerikson> I've ignored the front-end development scene since it was even a scene
[00:12:24] <mouseghost> smh why are people so loud
[00:12:29] <mouseghost> some party and a loud exhaust
[00:17:47] <gerikson> Saturday night
[00:17:49] <gerikson> party
[00:17:52] <gerikson> people getting it on
[00:18:45] <mouseghost> cool, but they dont need to be doing it here... its almost 10pm

[00:45:21] <quanticle> gerikson: What is even the new hotness in front-end development.
[00:45:49] <quanticle> Is Vue still hot?
[00:45:57] <quanticle> Or are we on to
[00:45:59] <quanticle> <checks notes>
[00:46:02] <quanticle> Uh... NextJS
[00:46:08] <ngoldbaum> quanticle: still react
[00:47:05] <quanticle> So one thing I'll be talking to the team on Tuesday about is about using `.sync` in Vue components
[00:47:11] <quanticle> And why they shouldn't
[00:47:49] <quanticle> I just spent a solid day and a half debugging spooky-action-at-a-distance problem caused by overuse of two way data bindings
[00:48:18] <quanticle> It's frustrating because this is the sort of thing that seems like teams *only* learn via experience
[00:49:08] <quanticle> Like, I've encountered this problem with .Net WPF. I've encountered it with ASP.Net. I've encountered it with Knockout.js. I've encountered it in Angular. And now I'm dealing with it in Vue.
[00:49:40] <ngoldbaum> just generically callback hell sucks
[00:50:22] <quanticle> Well, yeah, but I figured that we'd have learned better than to just start coupling UI components' states to other UI components' states
[00:51:40] <ngoldbaum> but that’s the easiest way to think about it from the point of view of the person that needs to make thing happen when other thing happens
[00:52:07] <ngoldbaum> and maintainability is much less important than shipping shit in most orgs
[00:53:09] <quanticle> Yeah, and two weeks later, someone like me ends up with a bug report that says, "When I try to zoom the map out, it keeps zooming back in"
[00:57:50] <mouseghost> is it relatively hard to get your product sold? if you are aiming at business clients of small/medium size?
[00:58:33] <edm> yoyo
[00:58:38] <edm> so what's on tonight
[00:58:40] <edm> i am cooked out
[00:58:50] <edm> but all went well and tomorrow will be an adventure too
[00:59:51] <Brekkjern> quanticle: It's svelte that's the new hot shit
[01:00:03] <quanticle> Oh shit
[01:00:10] <quanticle> I forgot about Svelte
[01:05:11] <ngoldbaum> mouseghost: as an indie dev trying to bootstrap a business like you from scratch? yeah probably

[01:28:36] <buttsbot> "SAY NO TO SMOKE DETECTORS!!!"
[01:29:20] <riv> people genuinely argue exactly like this
[01:29:53] <manicennui> I'm actually surprised that there isn't a real conspiracy theory about smoke detectors.
[01:30:48] <manicennui> They do actually contain a tiny amount of radioactive material, and they would be the perfect place for the government to hide cameras.
[01:31:07] <manicennui> Along with the requirement that they be installed in all homes, the conspiracies write themselves.
[01:31:51] <ngoldbaum> don’t tell any chiropractors
[01:32:22] <manicennui> The radioactive materials causes small defects in the spine.
[01:33:09] <companion_cube> even watches can contain some radioactive materials, no?
[01:33:15] <companion_cube> for lumiscent hands
[01:33:28] <manicennui> And everything in California.
[01:33:28] <ngoldbaum> expensive watches have tritium lume yes
[01:33:43] <ngoldbaum> but it’s an alpha emitter and the particles don’t make it outside the glass vials
[01:33:48] <companion_cube> or worse, manicennui
[01:33:53] <companion_cube> SWITZERLAND
[01:33:57] <companion_cube> abroad!!!!
[01:34:01] <Brekkjern> companion_cube: Only if the luminous hands don't require "charging" with light
[01:34:13] <ngoldbaum> the tritium was made *inside a nuclear reactor* tho so that sounds scary
[01:34:18] <companion_cube> real alpha men have plutonium powered watches
[01:34:31] <ngoldbaum> really old watches have radium dials that’s legit poison
[01:34:35] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[01:34:44] <Brekkjern> Radium to charge phosphor hands
[01:35:05] <companion_cube> yeah radium sucks
[01:35:14] <companion_cube> except in face cream, of course
[01:35:24] <manicennui> How about the other way the government spies on us: carbon monoxide detectors.
[01:36:01] <companion_cube> in France there was a lot of spilled ink on "smart" electricity counters
[01:36:02] <companion_cube> Linky
[01:37:05] <Brekkjern> I want to get a Visa card implanted into my hand, but I wish I could get it from my bank instead of having to deal with a third party...
[01:37:19] <Brekkjern> Like... just speaking of "government tracking" and all that shit :P
[01:37:23] <manicennui> "Essentially, the electrochemical cell consists of a container, two electrodes, connection wires and an electrolyte, typically sulfuric acid."
[01:37:24] <manicennui> OMG
[01:38:01] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: oh man have you ever seen the santa cruz city council meetings about smart meters
[01:38:03] <ngoldbaum> top kek

[01:38:32] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: no :D
[01:38:41] <Brekkjern> manicennui: I don't use the phone for payment at all. Just tap+pay on a card.
[01:39:11] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Just saying, do we really need even greater convenience?
[01:39:40] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: wifi in my house? i need that for work! wifi on my electric meter? instant brain cancer
[01:39:47] <Brekkjern> Eh... I don't think I can argue that getting a chip implanted in my hand is anywhere on the scale of "convenience" :P
[01:41:19] <quanticle> I saw a rant from an antivaxxer lady the other day who was saying that COVID vaccines: 1. cause your skin to become slightly magnetic (her example was, you can stick a spoon onto you and it won't drop) 2. cause your veins to glow under a blacklight and 3. Turn you into "Human 2.0", which "the government" is using to "replace" traditional humans
[01:41:29] <quanticle> And my reaction was, "Dang lady, this sounds awesome"
[01:41:41] <Brekkjern> Same
[01:41:53] <Brekkjern> I'm down for that
[01:41:59] <quanticle> "Whatever vax you're getting I should have got that one; all I got was a couple days of mild flu-like symptoms"
[01:42:15] <Brekkjern> Yeah. My vaccination was really underwhelming compared to that :P
[01:43:20] <manicennui> quanticle: Those are bad things?
[01:43:34] <quanticle> I know, right?!
[01:43:38] <manicennui> Those first two at least seem like something every kid and raver would want.
[01:44:04] <quanticle> I was looking at that and thinking, "Wait, I could never drop a screw again"
[01:48:49] <Brekkjern> I kinda want to implant magnets in my fingers so I can feel electromagnetic fields, but then I wouldn't be able to get an MR scan if I needed one, and every single time I went through a metal detector it would trigger
[01:48:59] <Brekkjern> Not that I do that all that often, but it would be a bit of a chore.
[01:51:40] *** Quits: dcz (~dcz@user/dcz) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[01:53:22] <quanticle> Yeah, I suppose if the COVID vaccine really did magnetize your skin, you wouldn't be able to go in for an MRI
[01:53:27] <quanticle> I guess that'd kinda suck
[01:53:52] <manicennui> Pfft. Like I want the government experimenting on me with their MRIs!
[01:54:00] <quanticle> lol
[01:54:07] <Brekkjern> MRI! That's the word. I thought MR sounded weird, but I couldn't remember the English one :S
[01:54:21] <manicennui> It's kind of amazing which things these idiots accept without question and which things they fight.
[01:55:05] <manicennui> I really think the solution is to wall off a few states in the South and allow them all to move there and do what they want.
[01:55:12] <manicennui> They'll all be dead in a decade.
[01:55:47] <manicennui> MS and AL would give them a good area, and there is nothing we need from those states.
[01:56:14] <quanticle> You know... we could have done that in 1860, but some *moron* named Abraham Lincoln decided that Noooooooooo wE nEeD tO pReSerVe tHe UnIoN
[01:56:20] <manicennui> Pay to relocation anyone who want to leave.
[01:56:30] <Brekkjern> I remember talking shit with an American a while back, and he was generally positive to Texas secceding on one condition. They bring all the (his words) "shithole states that are running a deficit with them and they deal with the crap"
[01:56:35] <manicennui> Well, they took too many states.
[01:57:01] <ngoldbaum> i think https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/ph393t/what_happens_when_an_antivaxxer_gets_vaccinated/ explains a lot of it
[01:57:03] <buttsbot> What happens when an anti-vaxxer gets vaccinated : ontario
[01:57:04] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Yeah, they'd be pretty fucked in no time even if they didn't take those states.
[01:57:13] <Brekkjern> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[01:57:14] <manicennui> A large portion of Texas is heavily reliant on federal funds.
[01:57:23] <ngoldbaum> it’s not really politics per se but people just don’t talk to doctors about medical stuff
[01:57:28] <manicennui> It would be interesting to see what happens.
[01:57:34] <ngoldbaum> and plenty of quacks out there who are more than willing to grift
[01:58:41] <manicennui> ngoldbaum: I saw that yesterday. I don't understand why chiropractors are still legal.
[02:00:25] <quanticle> I mean, it's for the same reason that "supplements" are legal
[02:00:50] <quanticle> Like, at some point, if people are going to be idiots, the best thing to do is to say, "Okay, well, we warned you"
[02:01:04] <ngoldbaum> if there’s a spot in the law for pseudomedical grifting then grifters will be there
[02:01:28] <ngoldbaum> people want easy answers :/

[02:18:49] <manicennui> Whole thing is some kind of screen
[02:18:55] <manicennui> Actually looks kind of cool
[02:18:59] <manicennui> But glad it won't be anywhere near me.
[02:19:04] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but imagine how fucking awesome it would be to go inside the center and having shit EVERYWHERE around you?

[02:21:21] <manicennui> Not that I would ever go to Vegas
[02:21:44] <Brekkjern> I've never been there, so...
[02:22:21] <manicennui> "all seats will have high speed internet access"
[02:22:56] <manicennui> "The wraparound screen will measure 160,000 sq ft (15,000 m2).[41] It will be the largest and highest-resolution LED screen in the world."
[02:23:29] <manicennui> "Ted King, who previously worked on Star Trek: The Experience, will create visual content for the MSG Sphere."
[02:23:52] <manicennui> I mean, it sounds really cool
[02:23:54] <gerikson> oh no what will Stockholm Globe Arena do
[02:23:59] <manicennui> But again, I'll never go to Vegas again.
[02:24:10] <gerikson> banned for life, eh
[02:24:15] <manicennui> Nah.
[02:24:35] <manicennui> There is just nothing there that interests me at all, and several things that annoy me.
[02:24:42] <gerikson> suuuure
[02:24:44] <gerikson> j/k
[02:24:47] <gerikson> I've been there once
[02:24:51] <gerikson> it's kinda plastic
[02:25:11] <gerikson> I know someone who works there and kinda hates the place but the money's good
[02:25:18] <gerikson> and he's in stuff like show lighting etc
[02:25:28] <gerikson> kinda hard to transfer skills
[02:25:34] <manicennui> I have no interest in gambling, I hate extreme heat, and the entertainment and food are far below what I have access to in Chicago.
[02:25:49] <manicennui> Also hate tourists.
[02:26:03] <manicennui> And things designed to attract tourists.
[02:27:57] <Brekkjern> Yeah, I don't really feel any urgent need to go there :P
[02:28:35] <manicennui> Dubai also look lame to me.
[02:28:46] <gerikson> yeah don't recommend
[02:30:30] <manicennui> If I were a rich asshole that liked to gamble I think I'd go to Monaco or something.
[02:30:41] <manicennui> Especially if there were some F1 to watch.
[02:32:12] <Brekkjern> Yeah. Las Vegas comes across to me as "The poor mans idea of being rich"
[02:32:20] <Brekkjern> It's just 100% tacky
[02:32:40] <manicennui> It was a good way for the mob to extract money from the average man legally.
[02:33:22] <manicennui> Over the last couple of decades they have tried to focus on making it more "family friendly", which is yet another reason I wouldn't go there.
[02:33:45] <manicennui> I'd love to find places where children aren't allowed.
[02:34:48] <manicennui> And I'd be willing to abstain from alcohol the entire time I'm there if it meant having no drunk people around either.
[02:38:24] <manicennui> https://www.theregister.com/2021/09/04/ai_patent_ruling/
[02:38:25] <buttsbot> Only 'natural persons' can be recognized as patent inventors, not AI systems, US judge rules • The Register
[02:39:00] <Brekkjern> Can a company register a patent?
[02:39:39] <manicennui> I believe they are always given to people, and the people assign them to their employer.
[02:39:50] <manicennui> Which is part of their IP agreements when they join.
[02:40:01] <Brekkjern> Mkay, good.
[02:40:22] <Brekkjern> It would be pretty fucky if the company could just register the AI generated patents in their stead
[02:40:24] <manicennui> I could be a bit off on the details there.
[02:41:48] <Brekkjern> Patent law is way out of my speciality :P
[02:42:32] <manicennui> Yeah, looks like the company is the assignee, and the inventors are people.
[02:42:46] <manicennui> Look at the Patent History near the bottom here: https://patents.justia.com/patent/11105957
[02:42:46] <buttsbot> US Patent for Virtual sensing for adjoint based incorporation of supplementary data sources Patent (Patent #  11,105,957 issued August 31, 2...

[02:43:55] <buttsbot> A Basic Guide to Patent Assignments - Patent Assignment Database and Search
[02:44:06] <manicennui> "Basically speaking, a patent assignment is a legal way for an inventor to transfer ownership of a patent to a business."
[02:45:34] <manicennui> I don't know why corporations are treated like people in politics.
[02:45:39] <manicennui> That was clearly not the intent.
[02:45:54] <manicennui> They are only supposed to be a person for purposes of liability.
[02:46:07] <Brekkjern> So rich people could get around bribery laws
[02:46:46] <manicennui> It's bizarre to me that we have such an open bribery system in the US.
[02:47:17] <manicennui> And all a politician has to say is "there was no quid pro quo" and they are good.
[02:47:47] <manicennui> Like why the fuck would the company give you money if not to influence your vote?
[02:47:54] <manicennui> And why would they continue to do so if you didn't do what they wanted?
[02:49:20] <manicennui> So how long until someone finds a way to have an AI declared a legal person?
[02:49:57] <Brekkjern> I can't wait for that clusterfuck
[02:50:28] <quanticle> Vegas has really good food
[02:50:45] <quanticle> Casino subsidized buffets are great
[02:50:58] <manicennui> quanticle: Yes, but Chicago has better food.
[02:51:24] <manicennui> I get it if you are from bumfuck Iowa I guess.
[02:52:35] <quanticle> Chicago? Food? Nah. New York has good food. Chicago has like... meat and pizza
[02:52:59] <manicennui> The fat guy sweat takes our food to a whole new level.
[02:53:16] <quanticle> lol
[02:53:21] <manicennui> It's pretty key to the Italian beef.
[02:54:31] <manicennui> Seasoned beef, au jus, giardiniera, and mozzarella on Italian bread, and a fat guy who sweats over it while he makes it.
[02:55:06] <manicennui> Watching a video about Apple's new campus. Looks kind of terrible.
[02:56:15] <quanticle> That's the one where they tried to put Post-It notes on the glass partitions (you know, like people put stickers on glass windows for birds), but facilities kept taking the Post-Its down because they didn't fit with the building's aesthetic
[02:56:27] <quanticle> With the end result that people kept walking into glass partitions
[02:56:33] <quanticle> bong
[02:56:35] <quanticle> *bonk
[02:56:36] <manicennui> Yeah, and some people were injured by walking into the glass.
[02:56:51] <manicennui> But they also stress how open it is "for collaboration".
[02:56:52] <manicennui> Fuck that.
[02:57:09] <manicennui> And there is one huge cafeteria so everyone has to walk from everywhere to eat there.
[02:57:52] <Brekkjern> Do you not have laws about marking glass so people with bad eyesight won't walk into it?
[02:57:53] <manicennui> I wish that there were literally anyone else doing interesting design for electronics.
[02:58:11] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Appleland is completely lawless!
[02:58:25] <Brekkjern> I don't know what I expected...
[02:58:39] <manicennui> If you are able to capture and kill Tim Cook in the battle area in the center, you become the CEO.
[02:59:52] <quanticle> Oh, is that what the center is? I thought they kept that area clear because that's where the iRocket will launch from once Tim Cook decides he's sick of living on Earth.
[03:00:06] <Brekkjern> Do the same rules apply to the Pentagon?
[03:00:37] <Brekkjern> Fight your way into the center and beat the chef in the restaurant at the center?
[03:00:43] <quanticle> Speaking of which, is the Apple building bigger than the Pentagon?
[03:01:01] <manicennui> Brekkjern: I mean, it should work that way.
[03:01:21] <manicennui> But I don't know where the restaurant/chef thing came from.
[03:01:38] <manicennui> quanticle: In diameter or square footage?
[03:02:42] <quanticle> Square footage
[03:03:32] <quanticle> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_office_buildings
[03:03:32] <buttsbot> List of largest office buildings - Wikipedia
[03:03:41] <Brekkjern> I've heard that the Pentagon has an absurd number of toilets because they had doubled up during the seggregation
[03:03:48] <quanticle> Yeah, the Apple building isn't even close
[03:04:17] <manicennui> Merchandise Mart and Sears Tower represent!
[03:04:18] <quanticle> Apple Park is 260,000 sq. ft. whereas the Pentagon is 620,000
[03:04:31] <manicennui> Oh, I'm sorry, where is NYC?
[03:05:02] <manicennui> Aon is up there too.
[03:05:07] <quanticle> Look, it's not NYCs fault that a bunch of hicks from Saudi Arabia took down its two largest office buildings.
[03:05:15] <manicennui> There is a really cool story about the exterior of the Aon.
[03:05:33] <quanticle> TIL Merchadise Mart
[03:05:40] <Brekkjern> I wonder which building is biggest in area. Not floor area, but ground area
[03:05:44] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aon_Center_(Chicago)#Refacing
[03:05:44] <buttsbot> Aon Center (Chicago) - Wikipedia
[03:06:11] <quanticle> In terms of footprint, I think there are some auto factories that are pretty big
[03:06:22] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but they aren't office buildings though
[03:06:32] <manicennui> "On December 25, 1973, during construction a 350-pound marble slab detached from the façade and penetrated the roof of the nearby Prudential Center.[11]"
[03:06:33] <Brekkjern> I should probably have specified that...
[03:06:33] <quanticle> Yeah, but you never said it had to be an office buuilding
[03:07:14] <manicennui> They paid about $80 million to resurface the building.
[03:08:05] <quanticle> I don't think that there are going to be too many office buildings with big footprints. It wouldn't suprise me of the Pentagon had the largest footprint as well as the largest square footage.
[03:08:27] <quanticle> With office buildings, especially office buildings in cities, it's usually more efficient to build up than out
[03:08:35] <manicennui> Merchandise Mart has a pretty big footprint, but nothing like the pentaon.
[03:09:04] <manicennui> It's only 25 floors and makes that list.
[03:09:21] <quanticle> I wonder why they built the Pentagon they way they did, tbh. It seems like it would have been more efficient to build a bunch of normal mid-rise office buildings that were connected by walkways.
[03:09:25] <manicennui> Cool architecture too.
[03:09:42] <manicennui> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Merchandise_Mart.jpg
[03:09:59] <manicennui> And there is a CTA station on one side of it.
[03:09:59] <quanticle> Yeah, next time I visit Chicago, I'm checking out the Merchandise Mart.
[03:10:15] <manicennui> You should go on one of the architecture tours.
[03:10:26] <manicennui> There is no city that comes close other than NYC.
[03:10:29] <ngoldbaum> quanticle: unlimited budget and cold war management styles
[03:10:56] <Brekkjern> quanticle: They built it like that so it would be quick to get from anywhere to anywhere: "It is possible for a person to walk between any two points in the Pentagon in less than ten minutes."
[03:10:56] <manicennui> And riding the elevated train into downtown, between the huge buildings, is really neat.
[03:11:44] <manicennui> There are a lot of amazing works that aren't right downtown either.
[03:12:16] <ngoldbaum> >Government officials agreed that the War Department building, officially designated Federal Office Building No 1, should be constructed across the Potomac River, in Arlington County, Virginia. Requirements for the new building were that it be no more than four stories tall, and that it use a minimal amount of steel. The requirements meant that, instead of rising vertically, the building would be sprawling over a large area. Possible sites
[03:12:16] <ngoldbaum> for the building included the Department of Agriculture's Arlington Experimental Farm, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery, and the obsolete Hoover Field site.[23]
[03:12:22] <ngoldbaum> i guess also wartime steel
[03:12:27] <ngoldbaum> shortages?
[03:12:28] <manicennui> Mies van der Rohe taught at IIT on the south side and designed the campus and many of the buildings.

[03:12:57] <Brekkjern> Ah
[03:13:05] <Brekkjern> You just posted that :P
[03:13:10] <Brekkjern> But yeah. Wartime steel shortage
[03:13:12] <manicennui> There is an interesting CTA station designed by someone else too.
[03:13:19] <manicennui> Near the IIT campus.

[03:14:50] <quanticle> Yeah, I'm looking at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_buildings#Largest_footprint and they're all factories or warehouses
[03:14:50] <buttsbot> List of largest buildings - Wikipedia
[03:15:29] <Brekkjern> Wait... The Lada factory is the biggest?
[03:15:38] <quanticle> By footprint, yeah
[03:15:58] <manicennui> quanticle: Except Gurnee Mills!
[03:16:02] <quanticle> A lot of car factories have to sprawl, since you can't really make an assembly line go up
[03:16:06] <manicennui> A shitty outlet mall outside of Chicago!
[03:16:17] <quanticle> Well, there's also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_World_Headquarters_and_Technology_Center
[03:16:17] <buttsbot> Chrysler World Headquarters and Technology Center - Wikipedia
[03:16:25] <quanticle> I guess that counts as office building?
[03:16:31] <Brekkjern> I was expecting Boeing or some shit like that would be the biggest
[03:16:42] <quanticle> Boeing has the biggest by volume
[03:16:45] <Brekkjern> I heard they had their own weather systems inside the buildings because of the size...
[03:17:02] <Brekkjern> Yeah. Height under roof probably is a requirement for that

[03:17:17] <manicennui> No prisons on that list?
[03:17:34] <quanticle> Yep, I toured that building. They fixed the weather problem by installing a bunch of shutters at the top that they could open and close to keep moisture from building up
[03:17:40] <manicennui> There must be a huge prison somewhere.

[03:19:14] <manicennui> They are ranked by inmates though.
[03:19:37] <Brekkjern> Spent all day in my half-sisters confirmation walking around in shitty dress shoes
[03:22:10] <manicennui> Seems like most prisons are multiple buildings.
[03:22:24] <manicennui> Look at the article for Rikers... Why are the buildings named after people?
[03:22:30] <manicennui> Are they famous prisoners?
[03:22:57] <Brekkjern> Yeah. Likely much easier to lock down a prison if you can't just force your way through to different floors and shit like that
[03:22:57] <manicennui> Ah, this one was named for a corrections commissioner.
[03:23:26] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Make it 100 stories underground so they have to fight their way up.
[03:23:33] <Brekkjern> lol
[03:23:37] <manicennui> And you have the high ground to defend it.
[03:23:47] <Brekkjern> Also, naming prisons after wardens or shit like that feels extremely dystopian...
[03:24:25] <manicennui> If you stay the longest as a prisoner, it should be named after you.
[03:24:31] <Brekkjern> lol
[03:24:59] <Brekkjern> Imagine when eternal life becomes possible. Being sentenced to multiple lifetimes and such would become ridiculous :P
[03:25:18] <manicennui> Demolition Man
[03:25:25] <Brekkjern> Pretty much
[03:25:34] <manicennui> I need to watch that again.
[03:25:41] <Brekkjern> Do we ever get an explanation for the sea shells in that movie?
[03:25:55] <Brekkjern> Or is that another one? I can't remember...
[03:25:56] <manicennui> The 80s and 90s had the best bad action movies.
[03:26:01] <manicennui> It's that one.
[03:26:05] <manicennui> I don't think they explained it.

[03:26:53] <manicennui> "How they work was once revealed by Stallone in a 2006 interview, explaining that a writer told him '...you hold two seashells like chopsticks, pull gently and scrape what’s left with the third.'"

[03:27:32] <manicennui> I love Wesley Snipes from that era.
[03:28:17] <Brekkjern> The 80's had a lot of good movies because they didn't try as hard
[03:28:53] <manicennui> In some cases they did and created movies that have never really been matched though.
[03:29:01] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[03:29:14] <Brekkjern> Cause they dared to fuck around and come up with gold in the process
[03:30:04] <Brekkjern> I mean... You can literally hire Space X to launch some shit to Mars for less money than it costs to film a new Transformers movie
[03:30:09] <manicennui> Terminator, Predator, Robocop, Aliens...
[03:30:34] <Brekkjern> Aliens is so much fun
[03:30:42] <Brekkjern> "Fun"
[03:30:43] <prussian> yeah, but what would be the payout?
[03:30:49] <manicennui> Aliens has one of the best female action leads ever.
[03:31:01] <Brekkjern> prussian: Of launching a block of dead weight to Mars?
[03:31:09] <prussian> Yeah.
[03:31:21] <manicennui> Can we launch certain members of the population?
[03:31:26] <prussian> At least "Yet another Terminator Reboot" has some expectation of profit, I'd imagine.
[03:31:33] <Brekkjern> Well, you didn't make another Transformers movie, so I see that as an absolute win.
[03:32:00] <prussian> Oh. lol
[03:32:05] <prussian> I mis-read, but sure.
[03:32:39] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Bumblebee was better than all of the Michael Bay movies, which is not saying much.
[03:32:46] <Brekkjern> Also, imagine the flex. "I hired SpaceX to yeet a block of lead into Mars" "But why though?" "Shiggles."

[03:45:12] <manicennui> The building I work in has a nice exterior but terrible interior.
[03:45:22] <manicennui> But it is also right next to CBOE.
[03:48:25] <manicennui> They were closing Lasalle in front of the board of trade and setting up tables one day per week.
[03:48:36] <manicennui> And that is where a bunch of the food trucks hang out too.
[03:50:20] <manicennui> I guess CBOE is another exchange that was started by the board of trade?
[03:50:29] <manicennui> I don't quite understand their relationship.
[03:51:14] <manicennui> We are next to the board of trade building.
[03:59:29] <manicennui> This Red Notice movie looks like some kind of stupid Fast & Furious spinoff.
[03:59:47] <manicennui> Probably doesn't help that the Rock is in it and the action scenes look dumb as fuck.

[21:02:11] <prussian> meh. I was born in it, molded by it.
[21:02:16] <prussian> it's my hell.
[21:02:26] <manicennui> I was too, but I escaped.
[21:02:29] <prussian> I know it's evil.
[21:02:33] <prussian> but idk.
[21:02:46] <manicennui> I don't care about it being evil really.
[21:02:57] <prussian> I tell people I live in Hartford, CT when I really live across the river in Manchester
[21:03:06] <prussian> wsell
[21:03:11] <manicennui> It might be different if I lived somewhere with some natural beauty I guess.
[21:03:16] <manicennui> The suburbs here do not have that.
[21:03:23] <prussian> I live next to a nice hiking trail
[21:03:26] <manicennui> The forest preserves are meh and crowded when it is nice out.
[21:03:34] <prussian> lol
[21:03:41] <prussian> that's how it always is, no?
[21:03:42] <manicennui> I've heard that the Twin Cities area is nice.
[21:03:48] <prussian> you just have to get up at 5am like me
[21:03:50] <prussian> simple
[21:04:12] <prussian> in summer, I just have the bug repellent wipes and would get up with the sun

[21:05:30] <prussian> etc.
[21:05:31] <manicennui> I haven't had a car for 14 years.
[21:05:34] <prussian> damn.
[21:05:52] <manicennui> I would have to have one in the suburbs.
[21:05:57] <prussian> ya
[21:05:59] <prussian> that's the curse
[21:06:08] <manicennui> It's way more than that though.
[21:06:15] <manicennui> There is just so much more to do here.
[21:06:15] <prussian> and if you lived in fuck-all nowhere, you'd have a truck, as is the way.
[21:06:28] <manicennui> And so many more options for everything from food to entertainment.
[21:06:32] <prussian> ya true
[21:06:42] <manicennui> Sure, but if I lived in a rural area, it would definitely be somewhere beautiful.
[21:07:03] <prussian> ya.
[21:07:09] <manicennui> I'd have to have a car if I moved to Asheville, but that natural areas are insane.
[21:07:11] <prussian> i was kinda joking
[21:07:35] <prussian> only because in like Carlsbad New Mexico, like everyone had a truck. not quite rural, but everything was about an hour away outside of town.
[21:07:39] <prussian> so closish enough.
[21:07:54] <prussian> true..
[21:08:02] <prussian> not familiar with NC
[21:08:21] <prussian> just cruisin google maps pics. looks cool
[21:09:14] <prussian> idk. If I were gonna move to a city, I'd want to move to Boston.
[21:09:31] <prussian> Boston seems like the nicest city I've personally seen.
[21:09:55] <manicennui> Uploading the photos from my trip now.
[21:09:59] <manicennui> Will link them in a bit.
[21:10:03] <prussian> sure
[21:10:10] <prussian> do you like rent cars a lot?
[21:10:13] <prussian> since you don't own one?
[21:10:17] <manicennui> Nope.
[21:10:26] <manicennui> I used to use a car sharing service like zipcar once in a while.
[21:10:33] <manicennui> None of that is necessary with Uber.
[21:10:40] <manicennui> But I don't use Uber frequently.
[21:10:53] <prussian> when I had an Avis discount through a job I had, I'd just do that for long trips.
[21:10:56] <manicennui> I can walk to plenty of thinks, and public transportation is cheap and good.
[21:11:02] <prussian> oh uber, true.
[21:11:07] <prussian> fair
[21:11:09] <manicennui> I did rent a car in NC if that is what you were wondering.
[21:11:24] <prussian> just curious how the no-car life works
[21:11:32] <prussian> in CT, I can't imagine being without a car lol
[21:11:36] <manicennui>  Use delivery services a lot really.
[21:11:42] <prussian> dam
[21:11:48] <prussian> makes sense...
[21:11:48] <manicennui> The amount I'd spend to Uber is about the same as the delivery charge.
[21:11:59] <manicennui> And many grocery delivery services have no charge if you buy enough.
[21:12:20] <prussian> interesting..
[21:12:20] <manicennui> When I was working in the office, I'd stop places on the way home.
[21:12:26] <prussian> I never trust those pickers though.
[21:12:31] <prussian> for picking produce.
[21:12:31] <manicennui> It all works out to way, way less than owning a car.
[21:12:41] <manicennui> Plus I can go get drunk and never worry about driving.
[21:12:53] <manicennui> I've not had any real problems with that.
[21:13:12] <manicennui> But there are also multiple grocery stores less than a mile from me.
[21:13:12] <prussian> THIS. That is basically the only wfh downside I have. I use to just stop and I could do like 30 bucks here or there every week or so and never need to really go big at the grocery story
[21:13:18] <prussian> hahahhaa
[21:13:25] <prussian> I'm drinking right now.
[21:13:31] <prussian> the system works.
[21:13:49] <prussian> any good jobs in NC or should I just pass?
[21:14:00] <manicennui> Yeah, in the research triangle.
[21:14:40] <manicennui> Basically Duke University and a few other universities are there.
[21:14:43] <prussian> idk. do I want to move though?
[21:14:50] <prussian> good to know.
[21:14:50] <manicennui> Moving sucks.
[21:14:59] <prussian> so it seems.
[21:15:10] <manicennui> There are many companies there, but the research triangle is basically three universities including Duke.
[21:15:14] <prussian> I use to live in Simi Valley, California. That was an interesting move.
[21:15:58] <prussian> doesn't RH have some office in NC?
[21:16:55] <prussian> redhat if it wasn't clear.
[21:17:36] <manicennui> Not sure.
[21:17:40] <manicennui> I know Cognitect is there.
[21:17:57] <manicennui> But they are a remote company, so it barely matters.
[21:18:00] <prussian> true.
[21:18:03] <manicennui> s/remote/distributed/
[21:18:10] <prussian> the idea of "full remote" still bugs me though.

[21:18:44] <prussian> I'm wasting too much time on haskell lol
[21:19:33] <prussian> neat
[21:19:40] <prussian> good stuff.
[21:20:13] <riv> it's really fun
[21:20:39] <prussian> haskell? ya it's ok. I crapped out some generic prototype stuff at work with it so far.
[21:20:54] <prussian> I'm hacking around with yesod to just get a feel for it personally. see how it goes.
[21:26:58] <manicennui> I'm glad I have two days to recover from my trip.
[21:27:02] <manicennui> Travel makes me so tired.

[21:28:18] <manicennui> I've had coworkers fly in the morning before work, which is insane to me.
[21:28:24] <manicennui> Even the night before is not enough.
[21:28:26] <prussian> I hate traveling mostly because crohn's. Last trip I was on was for Re:Invent in Las Vegas and I'd have to use the bathroom constantly.
[21:28:30] <manicennui> And this was back when we had to come into the office.
[21:28:31] <prussian> ugh.
[21:28:50] <prussian> red eyes...
[21:28:51] <prussian> ya
[21:28:58] <prussian> i can't really sleep on a plane myself.
[21:28:59] <manicennui> Oh, you missed our Vegas discussion and reminded me of the one reason why someone might want to go there.
[21:29:07] <prussian> which is?
[21:29:08] <prussian> lol
[21:29:21] <manicennui> The AWS conference.
[21:29:23] <manicennui> If that is your thing.
[21:29:25] <prussian> hahahahhahaha
[21:29:32] <manicennui> It's not my thing.
[21:29:33] <prussian> I went because work sent me, simple as that.
[21:29:34] <prussian> lol
[21:29:41] <manicennui> Yeah, we send a bunch of people too.
[21:29:52] <prussian> I was like, sure I'll play craps-I mean attend talks and learn all about the clouds and stuff.
[21:30:01] <manicennui> We even had a guy who wrestled someone a couple years ago at some weird promotion.
[21:30:08] <prussian> nice
[21:30:33] <prussian> Wonder if they are gonna bring it back this year. at least in person.
[21:30:50] <prussian> it wasn't bad though, but the people I went with were buzzkills.
[21:31:17] <prussian> I think I had a tallboy and just started sipping, going up and down the strip. ended up being alone for most of the trip.
[21:31:37] <prussian> Oh, that's the other reason to go to vegas. Open container laws.
[21:31:54] <manicennui> Yeah, but you basically have to drink to tolerate being there.
[21:31:55] <prussian> shotgun a beer in front of a cop. good stuff.
[21:31:57] *** Joins: gwozniak (~user@dsld126.ody.ca)
[21:32:01] <prussian> lmao.
[21:32:04] <prussian> true.
[21:32:24] <prussian> Our team got invited by some company to basically golf. that was fun.
[21:32:40] <prussian> just teeing off. i don't remember what they call it.
[21:32:44] <prussian> or driving balls down range.
[21:32:45] <prussian> uh
[21:32:56] <gwozniak> Driving range, I expect
[21:33:11] <prussian> anyhow. that was fun
[21:33:28] <prussian> but the conference itself was mostly a snooze. learned a few new ideas, that's about it.
[21:33:32] <gwozniak> Yeah, driving ranges are fun. Golfing is less fun.
[21:33:39] <prussian> so true.
[21:33:57] <manicennui> Most of my coworkers use conferences as an excuse to goof off.
[21:34:02] <prussian> ^
[21:34:10] <prussian> ya.... that's basically the only reason I went lmao.
[21:34:23] <manicennui> People should use them as a chance to see what is going on outside of our company and gain new ideas.
[21:34:23] <prussian> that and I used my vacation and flew to LA the end of the week.
[21:34:33] <manicennui> Which is why I think Strange Loop is the best conference to attend.
[21:34:56] <gwozniak> Want to get to that one some day
[21:34:57] <manicennui> Vendor conferences are a waste of time unless your business is deeply involved with that vendor.
[21:35:02] <manicennui> And I don't mean that you use AWS a lot.
[21:35:02] <prussian> I'll be honest, that was the first conference I went to lol
[21:35:13] <prussian> most the time I just dip out of doing those.
[21:35:26] <manicennui> You will find out about everything they announce within minutes.
[21:35:31] <manicennui> Without going.
[21:35:35] <prussian> true
[21:36:14] <manicennui> Strange Loop just uploaded a new version of this talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4
[21:36:14] <buttsbot> "Simple Made Easy" - Rich Hickey (2011) - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4
[21:36:23] <prussian> It's cool to talk to others. Good way to meet people sometimes.
[21:36:43] <prussian> get an idea what real people who aren't selling crap are doing.
[21:36:44] <manicennui> You really shouldn't bother unless you are going to socialize frankly.
[21:36:51] <manicennui> You can almost always watch the videos later.
[21:36:55] <prussian> lol
[21:36:57] <prussian> so true.
[21:37:23] <prussian> I probably wouldn't want to go again.
[21:37:31] <prussian> at least re:invent
[21:37:39] <manicennui> Local conferences are easier, and fortunately I live in a good city for them.
[21:38:10] <manicennui> Goto has a lot of talks that are similar to Strange Loop, and Chicago is one of the cities they have a conference in.
[21:38:15] <prussian> fair. they do some local vendor ones here for gas station crap. thankfully marketing is forced to staff those booths.
[21:38:17] <prussian> never been asked.
[21:38:31] <prussian> neat.
[21:38:42] <prussian> I will have work pay for me to go to all of the conferences.
[21:38:43] <manicennui> I actually would like to go to a fintech conference.
[21:39:01] <prussian> do they have those?
[21:39:06] <manicennui> Yes.
[21:39:22] <manicennui> But I think they are more focused in IB, which is not what we do.
[21:39:27] <manicennui> s/in/on/
[21:39:54] <prussian> wouldn't know what IB is
[21:39:55] <prussian> lol
[21:40:00] <manicennui> investment banking
[21:40:02] <prussian> oh
[21:40:12] <manicennui> We are a lender.
[21:40:14] <prussian> you sure it wouldn't be around crypto currencies?
[21:40:19] <prussian> I hear that's the future bro.
[21:40:24] <manicennui> Probably a lot of that since IB is interested in it.
[21:41:24] <prussian> the future.
[21:41:44] <prussian> I'm sure there is a cryptocurrency out there that claims to solve lending something
[21:42:13] <manicennui> I'm sure.
[21:43:12] <manicennui> I hate when Amazon teases their new shows.
[21:43:21] <manicennui> I see it in the list and then realize it is just a teaser.
[21:43:30] <manicennui> Wheel of Time teaser available.
[21:43:41] <prussian> "Coming Soon"
[21:43:49] <Brekkjern> Yeh
[21:44:13] <manicennui> I never read Wheel of Time.
[21:44:34] <Brekkjern> It's OK
[21:45:27] <manicennui> Teaser looks decent.
[21:45:47] <Brekkjern> It goes on for a bit too long, and the ending could have been done better
[21:45:53] <manicennui> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F75UGq2Uqhs
[21:45:53] <buttsbot> Amazon's The Wheel of Time - Official Teaser Trailer (2021) Rosamund Pike - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F75UGq2Uqhs
[21:46:02] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[21:46:12] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Yeah, a friend told me that a lot of the middle books dragged.
[21:46:24] <Brekkjern> It's the middle-end books IMO
[21:46:47] <manicennui> I'm just kind of tired of fantasy.
[21:46:49] <Brekkjern> The world is interesting and the characters are pretty great, but you notice that the author didn't really know how to end it
[21:47:06] <Brekkjern> And then he died, and another author had to finish it from the notes
[21:47:10] <manicennui> I think fantasy needs to move past swords and wizards.
[21:47:19] <Brekkjern> So the style changes a bit much for me in the last 3 books
[21:47:32] <manicennui> I'd say anime does a great job of this.
[21:47:48] <Brekkjern> What do you mean?
[21:48:46] <manicennui> Fullmetal Alchemist and Demon Slayer are fantasy, but they don't stick to the tired cliches.
[21:48:56] <Brekkjern> True
[21:49:37] <Brekkjern> Same with Avatar really
[21:49:43] <manicennui> I don't think the fantasy genre has quite figured it out yet generally.
[21:49:53] <manicennui> Urban fantasy doesn't do much for me.
[21:50:00] <Brekkjern> Honestly, I think the genre has figured it out too much.
[21:50:12] <manicennui> Doesn't help that almost all urban fantasy seems to have the same plot.
[21:50:24] <Brekkjern> It found a formula that worked, and honed that formula into perfection, meaning everything is a copy of that formula :P
[21:50:31] <manicennui> Modern setting, and someone discovers that they are the ONE.
[21:50:35] <manicennui> And magic is real.
[21:50:41] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[21:51:57] <manicennui> I guess superhero stuff is fantasy, but it is super cliche too.
[21:52:40] <Brekkjern> Eh
[21:52:53] <Brekkjern> I don't think it's fantasy. It doesn't really work with the same framework at all
[21:53:03] <Brekkjern> It's closer to sci-fi IMO, and it's pretty fucking far away from that.
[21:54:53] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy#By_theme_(subgenres)
[21:54:53] <buttsbot> Fantasy - Wikipedia
[21:55:13] <manicennui> I think that the problem with these is that too many are little more than aesthetics.
[21:55:46] <Brekkjern> Pretty much
[21:56:17] <manicennui> Lucifer is perhaps a good example of good contemporary fantasy.
[21:56:23] <Brekkjern> Haven't seen it
[21:56:33] <manicennui> It's quite good.
[21:56:40] <Brekkjern> So I've heard.
[21:56:43] <manicennui> Even has a decent exploration of free will.
[21:56:54] <manicennui> It can be a bit formulaic at times though.
[21:57:00] <manicennui> And there is one season that is a bit too long.
[21:57:12] <manicennui> I think a new season is starting soon.
[21:57:29] <manicennui> "Lucifer season 6 is out September 10 on Netflix worldwide. All 10 episodes will be available at once."
[21:58:24] <manicennui> I don't know how closely it follows the comic.
[21:58:32] <Brekkjern> Irrelevant mostly IMO
[21:58:33] <manicennui> I've read that there are some differences.
[21:58:58] <Brekkjern> Some times the source material is more of a "first draft"
[21:59:56] <manicennui> Sure.
[22:00:08] <manicennui> Wasn't implying that it should be the same.
[22:00:16] <manicennui> I almost like when they are pretty different.
[22:00:38] <manicennui> Gives me something to look forward to later if I choose to read it.
[22:01:14] <manicennui> With some anime I don't even think the manga is worthwhile unless you just need to know what happens.
[22:01:17] <manicennui> Like Demon Slayer.
[22:01:31] <manicennui> The animated fights are way beyond the manga.
[22:01:55] <Brekkjern> Mhm
[22:02:21] <manicennui> I couldn't even tell what was going on in some of the manga fight scenes that I took a look at.
[22:02:58] <manicennui> I didn't read it though, so I don't know if it adds a lot to the story.
[22:03:44] <Brekkjern> I don't read mangas really
[22:03:55] <manicennui> I haven't, but there are some that I'd like to.
[22:04:13] <manicennui> Oh, I read the first chapter of Dr. Stone.
[22:05:02] <manicennui> Hmm. John Wick could almost be considered fantasy.
[22:05:17] <Brekkjern> I'll allow it :P
[22:05:25] <manicennui> The whole organization behind the assassins is interesting.
[22:06:17] <manicennui> I rewatched most of 3 recently. Some of the fight scenes are kind of bad.
[22:06:18] *** Quits: gwozniak (~user@dsld126.ody.ca) (Quit: ERC (IRC client for Emacs 28.0.50))
[22:06:25] <manicennui> But there are so many of them that there were many good ones too.
[22:06:35] <manicennui> And the plot is terrible.
[22:06:42] <Brekkjern> Yep
[22:06:46] <manicennui> But the plot has been getting worse with each sequel.
[22:06:48] <Brekkjern> The third movie is awful
[22:08:01] <manicennui> His ability to take punishment went beyond belief in the third one too.
[22:08:19] <manicennui> Especially the fact that he barely ever seems to be slowed down by any of it.
[22:09:18] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[22:10:04] <manicennui> But I'll watch another one, so...
[22:10:17] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but will you watch it for the plot, or for the action?
[22:10:30] <manicennui> I mean, you don't watch any of the series for the plot.
[22:10:44] <Brekkjern> Exactly, so the theme/story is irrelevant to what kind of classification you give it.
[22:11:03] <manicennui> I think the mistake with 3 is that he fought other people who were supposed to be top assassins, and it was clear that he won half the fights by luck.
[22:11:13] <manicennui> It was more believable when he was just murdering some local crime family.
[22:11:33] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[22:15:34] * manicennui puts Willow on.
[22:15:45] <manicennui> Haven't watched this movie in a long, long time.
[22:15:51] <manicennui> It really should be more popular.
[22:16:01] <manicennui> Speaking of fantasy.
[22:16:22] <manicennui> How many movies have a little person as the main protagonist?
[22:16:47] <Brekkjern> In what way?
[22:16:59] <manicennui> ?
[22:17:16] <Brekkjern> As in size, the diagnose, fantasy race?
[22:17:30] <manicennui> Warwick Davis is the lead character.
[22:17:34] <Brekkjern> Ah
[22:17:41] <manicennui> He is a dwarf, or whatever they prefer to be called.
[22:17:56] <Brekkjern> Dunno. The only other character I can think of is Tyrion Lannister really.
[22:18:25] <Brekkjern> And you could argue that he's not part of the lead
[22:18:41] <manicennui> Davis is definitely *the* lead character in Willow.
[22:19:05] <manicennui> And the eponymous character.
[22:19:50] <Brekkjern> I bet there are a few movies, but I doubt it fits into the heros journey in hollywoods idea of it
[22:20:07] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_(film)
[22:20:07] <buttsbot> Willow (film) - Wikipedia
[22:20:12] <manicennui> Another great movie from the 80s.
[22:20:56] <manicennui> Damn, I had forgotten about Cocoon. I should watch that again.
[22:21:57] <manicennui> "A television series based on the film is in development, scheduled to be released on Disney+ in 2022."
[22:21:58] <manicennui> Wow.
[22:22:12] <Brekkjern> I wish more new original stuff would be made.
[22:22:14] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_(TV_series)
[22:22:14] <buttsbot> Willow (TV series) - Wikipedia
[22:22:23] <Brekkjern> I'm pretty fucking tired of everything being based on something else all the time
[22:22:33] <manicennui> Studios only do safe things.
[22:22:46] <manicennui> Films that are not safe are only purchased.
[22:22:47] <Brekkjern> Sure, I'm hyped for Dune, but it's also because of Dennis Villeneuve directing it.
[22:22:51] <manicennui> At some film festival.
[22:22:54] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[22:23:14] <gerikson> I got through 1.5 books of the Wheel of Time
[22:23:27] <gerikson> honestly I thought the writing sucked
[22:23:40] <gerikson> Memory, Sorrow and Thorn is good fantasy
[22:23:44] <gerikson> Tad Williams
[22:23:52] <gerikson> good deconstruction
[22:23:54] <manicennui> Doesn't sound good for the Willow series. The first two directors left.
[22:23:58] <gerikson> also his VR novels are good
[22:24:59] <manicennui> Wow. There are like 100 little people in this village scene.
[22:25:28] <manicennui> If this were made today, they would use camera tricks to cast average height people.
[22:26:09] <Brekkjern> Doubt it. It would be slaughtered
[22:26:13] <manicennui> Amusingly, there is an even smaller race of people in this movie that were edited in or something.
[22:26:44] <Brekkjern> LOTR did it, but that's 20 years old now.
[22:27:29] *** Joins: gwozniak (~user@dsld126.ody.ca)
[22:28:10] <gerikson> omg so it is
[22:28:15] <gerikson> I am so old
[22:28:20] <Brekkjern> Yes
[22:28:21] <Brekkjern> :P
[22:28:51] <manicennui> I watched Crouching Tiger recently, which is also 20 years old.
[22:30:25] <gwozniak> I remember watching that a second time and being much less impressed with it
[22:30:29] <gwozniak> But I loved it the first time
[22:30:41] <manicennui> I loved it this time too.
[22:31:20] <Brekkjern> Discussing how great older movies/shows/books are compared to newer stuff is survivorship bias anyway.
[22:31:36] <manicennui> Brekkjern: It is, but where are the great movies today?
[22:31:54] <gwozniak> Hereditary is one that comes to mind
[22:32:11] <manicennui> There are certainly very good movies behind made, but it's hard to think of any kind of action/adventure movie that comes close to the 80s and 90s.
[22:32:14] <gwozniak> Mad Max: Fury Road is an action masterpiece
[22:32:26] <Brekkjern> Jojo Rabbit is fucking great. So is Knives Out.
[22:32:32] <manicennui> gwozniak: Horror/thriller is one genre where there might be equal or better films today.
[22:32:36] <gwozniak> Knives Out is stellar
[22:32:40] <Brekkjern> Spider Man: Far Into the Spider-Verse is great.
[22:32:45] <Brekkjern> Coco is amazing
[22:33:03] <gwozniak> +1 for "Into the Spider-Verse"
[22:33:08] <Brekkjern> Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is great
[22:33:24] <Brekkjern> The Intouchibles
[22:33:32] <Brekkjern> In Bruges is amazing
[22:33:47] <Brekkjern> That one also containes a dwarf/little people
[22:34:01] <Brekkjern> Dunkirk is amazing
[22:34:11] <Brekkjern> I mean, I can go on, but that was just the last decade
[22:34:12] <gwozniak> Dunkirk was pretty good, yeah
[22:34:15] <manicennui> Most of these are movies I watched once and enjoyed but will never watch again.
[22:34:22] <edm> Ttss is amazing
[22:34:27] <edm> Which one tho
[22:34:34] <edm> Book or tv show or film?
[22:34:36] <gwozniak> I'd easily watch them again (and have, in some cases)
[22:34:49] <Brekkjern> edm: The discussion was movies.
[22:34:58] <Brekkjern> gwozniak: Same
[22:35:02] <edm> Ah right
[22:35:14] <edm> The ttss tv show wildly exceeds the movie btw
[22:35:24] <edm> I never got the alec guiness fuss till i saw it
[22:35:24] <Brekkjern> I've watched half of those movies at least twice
[22:35:45] <edm> He is _mesmerising_ as smiley
[22:35:54] <gwozniak> edm: I'll have to seek that out
[22:36:02] <edm> Best spy tv show ive ever seen
[22:36:07] <gerikson> eh I thought Dunkirk was too flashy
[22:36:08] <edm> And smiley’s people
[22:36:16] <edm> They did both
[22:36:23] <Brekkjern> Also, The Grand Budapest Hotel, and Arrival are pretty great.
[22:36:27] <gerikson> yeah I watched the movie, then the series
[22:36:30] <manicennui> I was just over WWII movies when I saw Dunkirk.
[22:36:34] <manicennui> It was certainly really well made.
[22:36:39] <manicennui> But I couldn't care less about the plot.
[22:36:44] <gerikson> too many pretty boys tbh
[22:36:52] <manicennui> And war movies seem too much like propaganda to me now.
[22:36:53] <Brekkjern> It follows more of a horror movie structure than a war movie structure
[22:37:05] <gwozniak> Parasite is one of the best movies I've ever seen
[22:37:06] <gerikson> at least there was a token scene of the French defenders covering the retreat
[22:37:18] <gerikson> I need to watch Parasite
[22:37:41] <manicennui> Okay, Parasite is a valid suggestion.
[22:37:55] <gwozniak> A Quiet Place and A Quiet Place Part 2 are both really well done
[22:38:03] <gerikson> A Quiter Place
[22:38:05] <riv>  Parasite +1
[22:38:06] <gwozniak> Rewatched them
[22:38:07] <riv> literally so good
[22:38:35] <gerikson> lol ok so now Techrights is mad the FSF doesn't actively campaign against systemd
[22:38:49] <gwozniak> Paddington and Paddington 2 are also really, really good, despite what you may think
[22:38:59] <gerikson> and that Devuan is on "Liberia"
[22:39:11] <manicennui> But Parasite is part of one of the genres that does seem to be done well now.
[22:39:14] <gerikson> so funny seeing this bettors on the wrong horse get shafted
[22:39:23] <gerikson> gwozniak: you amaze me
[22:39:23] <riv> according to RMS systemd is libre
[22:39:28] <gerikson> but I'll check 'em out
[22:39:35] <Brekkjern> I can also recommend Mr. Jones if you want to be depressed.
[22:39:36] <gerikson> yeah
[22:39:43] <gerikson> Brekkjern: no thx
[22:39:58] <Brekkjern> It's very well made, and rather harsh.
[22:40:19] <manicennui> Dredd comes very close to what I'd like to see from action movies.
[22:40:31] <manicennui> Was definitely a very good movie.
[22:40:43] <gwozniak> Yeah, Dredd was *way* better than I thought it would be
[22:40:44] <gerikson> the latest one? with Oliphant?
[22:40:47] <gerikson> I loved that
[22:40:49] <Brekkjern> I need to rewatch that one to have an opinion.
[22:41:02] <manicennui> gerikson: heh
[22:41:07] <manicennui> That's not Oliphant.
[22:41:14] <gerikson> no?
[22:41:17] <gwozniak> Urban
[22:41:21] <manicennui> It's Karl Urban.
[22:41:22] <gerikson> oh yeah
[22:41:26] <gerikson> d'oh
[22:41:39] <gwozniak> Locke is another great movie
[22:41:39] <gerikson> the best thing is he stays in fucking character and doesn't remove his helmet
[22:41:45] <manicennui> Lena Headey is the boss of the bad guys.
[22:41:55] <gerikson> it's a tight action film
[22:42:06] <Brekkjern> Ford v Ferrari is actually rather OK. Not something I'd put on a pedestal, but it was entertaining and well made.
[22:42:07] <gerikson> and really leans into the dystopia
[22:42:38] <manicennui> gerikson: Just a hint of the fantastical elements of the universe too.
[22:42:45] <manicennui> Hope they make a sequel eventually.
[22:42:51] <manicennui> But they'll probably fuck it up.
[22:42:52] <gerikson> I'm not really into Dredd lore
[22:43:09] <manicennui> gerikson: The woman he was testing is a bit psychic.
[22:43:10] <gerikson> I d/l the entire comic but tbh it's pretty damn pulpy
[22:43:17] <gerikson> edgy for its time
[22:43:18] <gwozniak> Boyhood and Moonlight are also great movies
[22:43:24] <gerikson> loved Boyhood
[22:43:37] <gerikson> manicennui: cool to see that's "canon" then
[22:43:40] <gerikson> she was good too
[22:44:19] <manicennui> https://judgedredd.fandom.com/wiki/Psi_Division
[22:44:19] <buttsbot> Psi Division | Judge Dredd Wiki | Fandom
[22:44:27] <gerikson> the Stallone movie was shit tho
[22:44:32] <gerikson> but hey it was hte 90s
[22:44:47] <manicennui> Notice that article mentions Anderson.
[22:44:51] <manicennui> That was the woman in Dredd.
[22:44:56] <riv> Boyhood blew my mind
[22:45:04] <riv> unbelievably ambitious
[22:45:47] <gwozniak> The Social Network, Inside Llewyn Davis are a couple more that come to mind
[22:45:57] <manicennui> One of my favorite movies ever was actually fairly recent, but also not an action movie.
[22:46:01] <manicennui> I like weird shit though.
[22:46:05] <gerikson> ``Originally appearing while the city was facing the first attack by Judge Death of the Dark Judges (a group of undead Judges from another dimension who seek to destroy all life on the basis that only the living commit crime) ''
[22:46:27] <gerikson> lol
[22:46:32] <manicennui> Shape of Water
[22:46:33] <gwozniak> Sarah Polley's Stories We Tell was an amazing movie to watch
[22:46:51] <Brekkjern> Shape of Water was decent.
[22:47:02] <gwozniak> Yeah, I liked that one
[22:47:18] <gwozniak> Pan's Labyrinth is my favourite of his
[22:47:29] <Brekkjern> Same
[22:47:38] <manicennui> I need to watch The Raid. It might be what I'm looking for from an action movie.
[22:47:59] <gwozniak> It's really good
[22:48:26] <manicennui> Ong Bak was great, but it was almost 20 years ago.
[22:49:51] <manicennui> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnDSDjfsHzA#t=4m28s
[22:49:52] <buttsbot> Ong Bak | Fight Club Scene - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnDSDjfsHzA#t=4m28s
[22:49:55] <manicennui> Can't get enough of that moment.
[22:50:09] <gwozniak> More not action, but The Favourite really entertained me
[22:51:14] <manicennui> The Wrestler is actually great.
[22:51:24] <manicennui> Not sure which genre I'd consider it to be.
[22:51:34] <gwozniak> Yup, that one was totally worth it
[22:51:45] <manicennui> wikipedia says sports psychological drama
[22:51:50] <Brekkjern> Spectral was a fun action movie. Nothing amazing and the sci-fi is absolute bullshit, but it was fun.
[22:52:07] <Brekkjern> The Man from UNCLE was entertaining too
[22:52:25] <Brekkjern> Sicario is also pretty good.
[22:52:31] <Brekkjern> Same with the first Kingsman movie
[22:53:16] <manicennui> Edge of Tomorrow is close too.
[22:53:19] <Brekkjern> Edge of Tomorrow is also great. You get to see Tom Cruise get killed in more and more ways. It's excellent.
[22:53:30] <manicennui> Yeah, I liked The Man from UNCLE a lot.
[22:53:39] <gwozniak> Enjoyed all those too
[22:53:52] <manicennui> I get hating Tom Cruise because of his beliefs, but he is in a lot of good movies.
[22:53:59] <gwozniak> Edge of Tomorrow was a wonderful surprise
[22:54:05] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[22:54:08] <Brekkjern> To both things
[22:54:16] <gwozniak> Yeah, Cruise is not someone I respect off camera, but damn, he knows how to do a movie
[22:54:17] <manicennui> The Mission Impossible and Jack Reacher series are both highly watchable.
[22:54:22] <Brekkjern> Tropic Thunder was a lot of fun
[22:55:13] <manicennui> The Ip Man movies with Donny Yen (not the spinoffs) are great.
[22:56:04] <Brekkjern> I gotta watch those at some point

[22:57:20] <manicennui> s/Donny/Donnie/
[22:57:57] <manicennui> They are great despite the fact that they are also propaganda.
[23:00:55] <Brekkjern> Aren't all war movies that too? :P
[23:01:01] <gwozniak> I can see that just from the clip you suppled :)
[23:01:31] <manicennui> All you really need to know is that Sammo was the choreographer.
[23:02:00] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammo_Hung
[23:02:01] <buttsbot> Sammo Hung - Wikipedia
[23:02:09] <manicennui> Sammo is the shit.
[23:02:27] <manicennui> And he is hilarious when he fights in a movie because he is a big guy who moves really well.
[23:02:30] <manicennui> He is in the Ip Man movies.
[23:03:34] <manicennui> He and Jackie Chan were part of the same performing troupe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Drama_Academy#The_Seven_Little_Fortunes
[23:03:35] <buttsbot> China Drama Academy - Wikipedia
[23:04:17] <manicennui> It's amazing that so many of these guys came from drama schools.
[23:04:29] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_opera
[23:04:29] <buttsbot> Peking opera - Wikipedia
[23:04:41] <manicennui> "Peking opera, or Beijing opera (Chinese: 京剧; pinyin: Jīngjù), is the most dominant form of Chinese opera, which combines music, vocal performance, mime, dance and acrobatics."

[23:24:26] <manicennui> I think a lot of nuance is lost with comments like that.
[23:24:50] *** Quits: dcz (~dcz@user/dcz) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[23:24:50] <manicennui> It makes dumb people think that no one knows anything, and being completely ignorant is as good as being knowledgeable.
[23:25:03] <Brekkjern> Of course
[23:25:20] <Brekkjern> But there's no way to select your audience with Twatter...
[23:26:12] <manicennui> I forget who I was having this discussion with, but there are many, many things that I don't remember, but I know how to find the information again.
[23:26:20] <Brekkjern> Yep
[23:26:34] <gwozniak> And I know basically what to look up
[23:26:42] <Brekkjern> And you know how to interpret it.
[23:27:07] <gwozniak> We have discussion like this around hiring, and it's why I don't think whiteboard questions are all that valuable in most cases
[23:28:35] <gerikson> agree
[23:28:59] <Brekkjern> I'd argue whiteboard is good as long as you only do pseudocode.
[23:29:22] <gwozniak> It's not totally useless, no.
[23:29:30] <Brekkjern> I don't usually compile code with a whiteboard, so it's the complete wrong medium to use for that kind of test.
[23:31:02] <Brekkjern> If you want to see peoples ability to write some code in some language, then it's better to give them a task to code up at home or something.
[23:45:12] <manicennui> Last week on my trip I learned that television is even worse now.
[23:45:40] <manicennui> There are shows about pimple popping, and a show that is basically house hunters for people who won the lottery.
[23:46:36] <Brekkjern> There's shows about pretty much everything really
[23:47:07] <Brekkjern> And also the reason I never watch tv..
[23:47:56] <manicennui> I only watched it because I was at a place where the Internet connectivity sucked, and I was just relaxing.
[23:48:26] <Brekkjern> Yeah. I usually download a few episodes of various series when I know I'm gonna be somewhere with shit internet
[23:48:55] <manicennui> I had a bit of anime on my iPad, but I managed to find things on TV.
[23:49:05] <manicennui> Rewatched Crouching Tiger and such.
[23:51:26] <manicennui> I really need to lose some weight and become more active.
[23:51:38] <Brekkjern> You and me both
[23:51:56] <manicennui> hah
[23:52:07] <gwozniak> I really slacked the month of August in that regard
[23:52:07] <manicennui> I had forgotten about Willow accidentally turning a troll into a giant monster.
