[00:12:00] <JulienTant> Yeah, a command can call a function using exec, and a function can call a command using <enter-command>. I guess I didn't really read the manual enough to see there was a difference at first haha, and I probably expected that the syntax would be the same find macro and hooks

[00:15:52] <flatcap> yeah, it's a bit confusing

[13:57:04] <flatcap> morning all
[13:58:33] <flatcap> artagnon: for static strings, there are three step for getting translations working...
[13:59:53] <flatcap> first, you need `N_("just now")` to alert the message processor in the build
[13:59:53] *** Quits: just1602 (~just1602@199.58.80.143) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[14:00:05] *** Joins: just1602 (~just1602@199.58.80.143)
[14:00:43] <flatcap> next, the runtime call to `gettext(E0h)`, usually `_(E0h)` (which you have)
[14:01:47] <flatcap> finally, the translation needs to be "installed".  it's a little fiddly (once)
[14:01:52] <flatcap> Instructions: https://neomutt.org/dev/translate#testing-a-translation
[14:03:21] <flatcap> On an unrelated note, the French translation is only at 79% ;-)  https://neomutt.org/translate

[14:47:20] <laumann> how are you?
[14:49:22] <flatcap> hi laumann 
[14:49:31] <laumann> o/
[14:49:32] <flatcap> I'm good thanks.  how are you?
[14:49:53] <laumann> good good, never got started on any of the neomutt upstream backporting
[14:49:56] * laumann hides
[14:50:09] <flatcap> I _had_ noticed, but I didn't like push :-)
[14:50:33] <laumann> been busy with work and trying to relax in between christmas and new years
[14:51:02] <flatcap> no worries
[14:51:27] <laumann> I'm also not good a just picking something from a list - any patches you would like to see ported?
[14:52:11] * laumann throws another log in the stove
[14:52:32] * flatcap looks ...
[15:01:23] <flatcap> ok, upstream commit d0b9bec8 - Add a help choice '?' to the yes or no prompt for quadoptions
[15:01:35] <flatcap> that'd be a nice feature to merge
[15:03:38] <flatcap> many questions that neomutt asks are dependent on a config variable
[15:04:17] <flatcap> this feature turns  [Y/n] -> [Y/n/?] where ? offers some help
[15:07:49] <laumann> alright
[15:10:05] <flatcap> thanks

[17:47:35] <muttuser> hi there! i have a problem using neomutt with s/mime. opening a signed message it says "S/MIME signature could NOT be verified" on the bottom line and "Problem signature from: ..." in the message. gpgsm -k lists my imported keys.  when i try to sign an outgoing email i get "error signing data: Not trusted". besides smime_default_key i dont have
[17:47:35] <muttuser> any s/mime-related variables in my neomuttrc. what am i missing?
[17:55:16] <flatcap> hi muttuser
[17:55:50] <flatcap> sorry, dunno.  I had smime working years ago (briefly), but I don't use it
[17:56:06] <flatcap> however I saved my crypto config, here: https://gist.github.com/flatcap/c0d567ea97ef1b68ecf3df698210f9a5
[17:56:34] <flatcap> $smime_ca_location and $smime_certificates might be relevant
