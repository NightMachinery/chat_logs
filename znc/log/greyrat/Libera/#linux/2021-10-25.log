[00:46:50] <TheGuestMovie> fast-forward to 2021, only data centers use it, and sane people disable IPv6 just to reduce visual pollution
[00:46:58] <Psi-Jack> Umm.
[00:47:04] <TheGuestMovie> I hear mobile providers also use it for cell phones
[00:47:06] <Psi-Jack> Yeah, that's falser.

[19:34:52] <katp32> you're *sure* there's actually a terminal there and the mouse isn't just like that?
[19:34:54] <schillingklaus> does macaw use x11 or wayland?
[19:34:57] <macaw> i3 has a restart-in-place key binding. Pressing it doesn't show it.
[19:35:10] <katp32> schillingklaus: i3 is x11 only, so, x11

[19:35:46] <keir> it's just not showing a picture
[19:36:24] <macaw> I don't think i3 uses a compositor by default and no, I didn't turn one on.
[19:36:32] <keir> macaw: it doesn't
[19:36:34] <katp32> yeah, it doesn't use one by default

[19:37:00] <macaw> Yeah. It's a weird problem. First time I had it.
[19:37:03] <katp32> I've no idea then, but it's almost certainly not an i3 issue, more likely to be a graphics driver or xorg issue
[19:37:05] *** Joins: zro (~zro@user/zro)
[19:37:11] <schillingklaus> i3 is not very demanding in the ways of * bars, icons, wallpapers,... they are all possible, eventually using third party supplements, but not essential

[19:37:47] <keir> macaw: what's the display manager?
[19:37:48] <katp32> i3 comes with a bar, and I've never heard of anyone using desktop icons with i3...

[19:38:48] <macaw> keir: Nope. But it happened while I was playing a game on retroarch.
[19:39:09] <katp32> macaw: so the issue started when you were using retroarch?
[19:39:12] <evilop> running a compositor with i3 is basically required
[19:39:17] <macaw> Reboot would probably fix it, but I'd love to not lose my work in other workspaces.
[19:39:24] <katp32> evilop: no it isn't?

[19:39:55] <schillingklaus> no, the compositor is only required for threedimensional effects

[19:42:26] <katp32> it does not happen with floating windows either
[19:42:29] <keir> schillingklaus: never seen that either
[19:42:33] <evilop> many window managers works around it by eg drawing a black root window
[19:42:52] <evilop> or filling it with some pattern if you go really old school
[19:43:06] <katp32> macaw: hm, I've never had issues like that with AMDGPU, but could still be a graphics driver issue, or an xorg issue... have you checked dmesg?
[19:43:10] <macaw> evilop: I haven't looked at the code, but i3 always draws some wallpaper if it isn't displaying a window.
[19:43:18] <keir> evilop: and i3 uses a black root...
[19:43:25] <keir> hence it doesn't do that
[19:43:28] <katp32> evilop: you're forgetting that x11 usually uses a "root window" which draws behind everything else

[20:35:06] <TJ-> wwwi: passwd needs to execute as 'root' user in order to update /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow but it will only operate on the calling user's passwd entry, unless the calling user is also UID 0 (root)

[20:53:02] <katp32> see, I can't even remember which ones of some of these things are right because the education system here is inconsistent and (more importantly) so is the spell check on my laptop
[20:53:04] <opal> nothing kurahaupo, people are just less familiar with it here
[20:53:09] <TJ-> keir is an exception :)
[20:53:26] <Sauvin> opal, where is "here" (more or less)?
[20:53:35] <opal> i before e except after c or if it's pronounced like neighing or weigh
[20:53:38] <opal> i present to you: raleigh
[20:53:42] <opal> Sauvin usa
[20:53:53] <katp32> so even if I have it right, at some point spell check will tell me it's wrong, and I'll just assume I was wrong and not think about it, and then later I'll be using a different program and have it tell me the other spelling is wrong and then I get angry and take to a dictionary
[20:53:53] <keir> Keir is Irish so I'm not sure it counts in English rules
[20:54:07] <TJ-> macaw: how are you getting on ?
[20:54:08] <Sauvin> Oh, the "i before e" rule is simple enough IF you speak a Romance language.
[20:54:14] <opal> i never consult spellcheck, it annoys me more than it helps
[20:54:31] <Sauvin> Spellchecks get it wrong a lot.

[21:53:35] <katp32> jason1234: ?
[21:53:49] <jason1234> the N300 netgear is the best ever !
[21:53:50] <Psi-Jack> PaulFertser: Ubuquity EdgeRouter mostly, but I have considered Microtik.
[21:53:52] <hexnewbie> The sending to China is done in hardware by the secret tachyon transmitter in the CPU, so it doesn't affect performance. The data is also received before you're sent it, as to not cause any delays.

[21:54:34] <hkm> keir, so the one I have officially supports Windows and Mac only
[21:54:35] <katp32> I don't know much about sound card hardware, but in general linux kernelspace sound card drivers tend to just work, at least with all the devices I've ever owned. userspace is almost always to blame when it comes to sound issues on linux
[21:55:01] <keir> hkm: that has nothing to do with UNIX. you mean Linux or BSD if anything

[21:55:47] <Psi-Jack> managed by my UniFi Cloud Key Pro, with no devices for recording video to it. LOL
[21:56:22] <PaulFertser> Psi-Jack: as a datapoint, my OpenWrt device which is like 10 years old is running Unbound recursor with DNSSEC validation, serves WiFi to few clients and at the moment has uptime of 26 days (and the last reboot was due to power outage). This is ancient d-link dir-615-e4 with upgraded flash and ram. Feels pretty stable.
[21:56:30] <katp32> hkm: what OS the manufacturer says it supports doesn't matter, all that matters is 1) does the kernel have a driver for it 2) does it work well

[21:58:44] <hkm> however some audio interfaces, such as mine, requires additional software (that doesn't run on Linux) for setting and such. This is also true for other products for example the ones made by Arturia.

[21:59:54] <jason1234> it seems that was just the firmware of netgear taht gave such bad net performances. how can it be explained?
[21:59:58] <PaulFertser> jason1234: netgear (as other vendors of SOHO equipment) rarely develop anything but silly web interfaces, they basically take vendor SDK and tweak it slighly and that's it. DD-WRT does about the same but iirc they have a somewhat unified and better web-interface.

[23:53:39] <Gustavo6046> It is on its last legs, yes
[23:53:49] <[twisti]> jason1234: linux is a gigantic collection of things, a generic linux-dev channel would not be very useful
[23:53:53] *** Quits: tesseract (~tesseract@user/tesseract) (Quit: tesseract)
[23:53:54] <Gustavo6046> And lots of smartctl issues
[23:54:16] <Gustavo6046> Heck, I had to set fsck.mode=skip just to boot at all lately
[23:54:30] <hexnewbie> also if you did ‘cat /sys/...pci...’ perhaps it hung on trying to read /bin/cat from the hung disk
[23:54:32] <jason1234> [twisti]: so let's use windows then... if we have not dev channel to report bugs in human manneer
[23:54:35] <TJ-> Gustavo6046: oh for pete's sake; the thing has been dying and you're ignored it!
[23:54:35] <Gustavo6046> Because otherwise it'd ask for a manual fsck... And leave me without prompt indefinitely
[23:54:37] <[twisti]> if you can narrow down your problem to a particular library or program, there might well be a dev channel for that, though based on what you wrote, its much more likely misconfiguration than a programming problem
[23:54:57] <Gustavo6046> It was echo and tee, not cat
[23:55:13] <f843d0> jason1234: most likely you're the bug, attempting to report bugs in IRC
[23:55:15] <Gustavo6046> And both worked with a different sysfs path
[23:55:19] <[twisti]> jason1234: your trolling is unlikely to garner you sympathies or help
[23:55:20] <Psi-Jack> jason1234: Please troll elsewhere.
[23:55:24] <keir> jason1234: if you want to report bugs, kernel has a mailing list for that
[23:55:33] <jason1234> over IRC
[23:55:37] <Gustavo6046> TJ-: this is already the second HDD to grace its slot
[23:55:43] <jason1234> IRC is people first and linux
[23:55:50] <TJ-> Gustavo6046: so now get an SSD to replace it!
[23:56:00] <hexnewbie> Please, don't recommend the kernel mailing list for any of the issues being mentioned
[23:56:03] <TJ-> Gustavo6046: I hope your data and configuration were backed up
[23:56:04] <Gustavo6046> I'm going to make the most out of it and dunno where to backup stuff
[23:56:13] <Gustavo6046> SSD are crazy expensive
[23:56:15] <keir> i'm not recommending it
[23:56:29] <jason1234> never heard that to comm, phone is way better than emails

[23:57:02] <keir> jason1234: you're talking garbage now
[23:57:12] <f843d0> jason1234: like flirting is better than TikToking
[23:57:18] <[twisti]> jason1234: that is an ineffective and annying way to garner results, you should just stop doing it
[23:57:25] <Gustavo6046> jason1234 emails are the most reliable form of communication on the Internet

[23:57:47] <dTal> oh lol he's in here too
[23:57:54] * dTal gives jason1234 his money back
[23:57:54] <Gustavo6046> You'd be surprised how many people you can reach via email
[23:57:56] <evilop> Gustavo6046: except when it isn't
[23:58:11] <keir> he won't reach me via email
[23:58:13] * keir bounces
[23:58:16] <Gustavo6046> Important people even
[23:58:21] <Gustavo6046> Anyway
[23:58:26] <keir> Gustavo6046: I'm important!
[23:58:28] <dTal> jason1234: feel free to run windows on your raspberry pi man, let us know how it goes
[23:58:35] <evilop> like when your address gets on a blacklist
[23:58:37] <Gustavo6046> I'm afraid for this system
[23:58:38] <hexnewbie> I've written to billg a lot, and not a single reply
[23:58:38] <jason1234> i dont use emails since emails are non free: gmail,... outlook... and no freedom
[23:58:57] <f843d0> jason1234: wonderful assertion
[23:59:00] <keir> jason1234: email is completely decentralised?
[23:59:00] <Gustavo6046> I use Gmail
[23:59:09] <Gustavo6046> And I'm OK with it
[23:59:11] <jason1234> Gustavo6046: treator ;)
[23:59:17] <evilop> or someone runs exchange :p
[23:59:18] <Gustavo6046> Yum, treats
[23:59:24] <Gustavo6046> Almost Halloween indeed!
[23:59:32] <f843d0> jason1234: gmail is a mail service, outlook is a client
[23:59:32] <KillerWasp> They talk about windows, gmail and outlook. I never understand anything they say. *sigh*
