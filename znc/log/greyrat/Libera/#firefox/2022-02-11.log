[02:10:45] <F8ER> Hey all
[02:10:58] <F8ER> May I ask why Firefox doesn't have a shortcut editor by default?
[02:11:26] <F8ER> I mean... why would one be required to install a weird extension in order to customize shortcuts?
[02:12:12] <F8ER> Especially when the extension requires nearly all permissions and the add-on official page says: "This add-on is not actively monitored for security by Mozilla. Make sure you trust it before installing."
[02:13:02] <F8ER> Of course, its source is available on GitHub, however it's still a nonsense imho
[02:14:33] <F8ER> An example why one would need a customizable shortcut? Okay. There's a pretty neat extension called "Dark Reader" which comes with a customizable shortcut, and if set to some already used by Firefox (i.e. Alt+D), it's successfully ignored.
[02:15:41] <F8ER> So, in the result, the extensions has "Alt+D" configured, and if pressed, Firefox focuses on the address bar instead of passing the shortcut event to the extension.

[06:04:49] <benl90> Only works on Beta and nightly, I recommend nightly for daily driver while using it
[06:05:58] <benl90> F8ER, It doesn't have because they want user to follow firefox culture I assume, but in short any Firefox shortcut is default shortcut in many major browser, so why you need to change it.

[06:24:01] <F8ER> benl90, it matches with local shortcuts for other applications which are harcoded.
[06:24:04] <F8ER> hardcoded*
[06:24:39] <F8ER> Chrome allows custmozing default shortcuts easily, but Firefox results in "Can't override a Firefox shortcut"
[06:24:47] <F8ER> customizing*
[06:26:27] <benl90> As I remember, you can't override default shortcut in Chrome, Last time I check it also applied to CRedge as well,
[06:26:40] <benl90> I deploy numerous Firefox and Edge within company. 
[06:27:01] <F8ER> Alt+D works in Chrome
[06:27:26] <F8ER> It's successfully set for an extension
[06:28:41] <F8ER> I just set Ctrl+U for an extension and it worked

[06:38:39] <susi> what shortcuts especially
[06:38:48] <F8ER> susi, set Alt+D for an extension like in Chrome
[06:39:11] <susi> alt-d goes in address bar, but what you want it to do? what it does in chrome
[06:39:36] <susi> toggle extension on/off?
[06:39:45] <F8ER> It's set to Dark Reader extension -> "Trigger current site" as in the above preview

[06:40:16] <susi> you want DR to toggle on/off with alt-d?
[06:40:22] <F8ER> Ctrl+U was for example. 1 sec.
[06:40:32] <susi> can you just verbally say what it should do
[06:40:57] <susi> I'm using DR too
[06:41:10] <susi> alt-shift-a toggles on/off for me, i guess it's the default
[06:41:29] <susi> it's easy to change, just click where it reads "alt-shift-a" under on/off toggle 
[06:42:27] <F8ER> https://i.imgur.com/VTorINk.png
[06:42:43] <F8ER> susi, it doens't work.
[06:43:00] <F8ER> I mean, setting to Alt+D there makes no nse.
[06:43:02] <F8ER> sense*
[06:43:07] <benl90> alt-d is default key on firefox shortcut, you can't overwrite it kindly sir... 
[06:43:20] <benl90> I can't even overwrite it on any chromium browser.. 
[06:43:37] <F8ER> benl90, why not? What's the version?

[06:44:54] <susi> "Toggle current site Alt+Shift+A" by clicking that text, you can change it
[06:45:07] <susi> why you'd want to have it just alt-d?
[06:45:14] <susi> and why it wouldn't make sense?
[06:45:44] <benl90> newest, 98.0.4758 on Chrome, 99.0.4844 on beta, 100.0 on dev, not work, tested with bunce of computer, sorry, it doesn't work here. neither in firefox.. if you want to overwrite it in firefox, use script I provide you before.. it's for sake of security they don't allow to overwrite default shortcut key...
[06:45:44] <susi> I'm heavy DR user myself and don't quite understand the whole problem. why it has to be exactly alt-d, and why it does not make sense?
[06:46:04] <benl90> I don't speak for vivaldi, because vivaldi has key binding change ability by default. 
[06:46:21] <F8ER> susi, because Alt+D is the one free here currently.
[06:46:21] * benl90 agree with susi
[06:46:29] <F8ER> There other programs running on the local machine.
[06:46:35] <F8ER> Please understand the problem.

[06:47:37] <benl90> It doesn't work on chrome on my labs... I already check it just now... 
[06:47:42] <F8ER> It's like you're just accept the lack of customization, I don't. Your choice ^^
[06:47:54] <F8ER> you just*
[06:48:17] <benl90> I accept the customization using https://github.com/xiaoxiaoflood/firefox-scripts/tree/master/extensions/keyconfig you can change anything you want with it... 
[06:48:19] <susi> wut
[06:48:34] <susi> F8ER: so why alt+d does not make sense?
[06:48:38] <susi> switch it to alt+d, then?
[06:48:38] <F8ER> benl90, you disabled signature verifaction and added a secuirty hole.
[06:48:41] <benl90> Firefox UI and shortcut can be change to anything, just not in default installation and profile...

[06:49:36] <F8ER> benl90, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[06:49:37] <susi> for the toggle combination?
[06:49:38] <benl90> not stable channel... 
[06:49:40] <susi> or what you mean?
[06:49:46] <F8ER> oh ffs
[06:50:28] <susi> but yes, it works
[06:50:30] <F8ER> susi, does the damn shortcut (Alt+D) work for the aforementioned action ("Toggle current website") in the extention or not
[06:50:46] <susi> not sure, but why it wouldn't work?
[06:50:55] <susi> if you try to change to it, what happens?
[06:50:57] <F8ER> How did you change the shortcut?
[06:51:03] <susi> i already told multiple times
[06:51:10] <F8ER> The damn setting inside the extension doesn't work
[06:51:11] <susi> even posted picture to help understand 
[06:51:20] <benl90> susi, because it's default firefox shortcut sir.. 
[06:51:20] <F8ER> The damn general settings in Firefox doesn't work too
[06:51:41] <benl90> you can't overwrite default firefox shortcut key.. 
[06:51:43] <F8ER> It says the holy heck: "Can't override a Firefox shortcut"
[06:51:52] <susi> ok. so what's the problem?

[06:52:23] <susi> yes, he can't
[06:52:28] <susi> so case closed
[06:52:44] <benl90> but there are work around, use https://github.com/xiaoxiaoflood/firefox-scripts/tree/master/extensions/keyconfig

[06:53:02] <benl90> case opened and closed.. and it's working on nightly or beta. just not stable channel. 
[06:53:25] <susi> alt-d is pretty weird dark reader toggle combination, imo
[06:53:31] <susi> (or would be)
[06:53:37] <benl90> there are multiple case in the past malware use it to overwrite the default key to trigger themselves to do something nasty.. 
[06:54:44] <susi> I have never had a need to change default firefox ui shortcuts
[06:55:06] <susi> wouldn't install shit to my firefox just to have alt-d as a dark reader toggle
[06:55:18] <susi> why it can't be something else :) problem solved
[06:55:19] <benl90> that's what he said before :/ 
[06:55:45] <susi> like alt-shift-d would work
[06:56:06] <benl90> he said he only has that vacant for now, for global  shortcut key.. 
[06:56:28] <susi> but he does not have it vacant, it's a reserved ff shortcut
[06:56:34] <susi> and dark reader is a ff extension, so...
[06:57:02] <susi> and anyway he does not have all other combinations reserved :)

[06:59:28] <susi> they called me a troll and that's pretty rude
[07:01:10] <susi> and to be honest: alt-d is reserved for a good reason
[07:01:19] <susi> that's what i use to focus location bar
[07:01:43] <susi> there's some other combination for it, too, ctrl-something, but alt-d is better
[07:02:24] <susi> one of the shortcuts i use most often in addition to ctrl-t/w for tabs
[07:03:02] <susi> you should not have to toggle dr very often on/off, and anyway, it should not matter is the combination alt-d or alt-shift-d
[07:03:32] <benl90> susi, Yeah I agree, well, It's hard to say anything

[07:07:33] <susi> 75-90% of Mozilla's budget in recent years has come from Google
[07:07:49] <susi> and yet about 0% of internet users use Firefox nowadays
[07:08:08] <susi> mobile it's really like 0%, and desktop something super-lo

[07:10:16] <susi> 0.67 % on mobile and 7.4% on desktop is firefox share of internet users
[07:10:48] <susi> is it worth it? like the hundreds of millions it gets from google, yet. but how long? 
[07:11:22] <susi> there seems to be nothing in the future indicating firefox could really grow its market share
[07:11:53] <susi> and what other business avenues there are for mozilla? maybe something better projects to spend their money than firefox
[07:12:10] *** Quits: xx (~xx@user/xx) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[07:12:18] <susi> those percentages has been going down all the time
[07:14:38] <susi> there's too much variables for me to analyze the actual future, I do have too much unknowns. and I'd be happy if that was not the actual future
[07:15:35] <susi> I have not reserached this exact topic, which I should, so I can only guess .. but i think it seems like firefox is gonna die pretty soon
[07:16:47] <susi> maybe put me in the charge of marketing, mozilla? i'm pretty sure i could help
[07:17:20] <susi> it seems like mozilla does absolutely nothing to get new users, is it because google forbids? 
[07:18:17] <susi> I lately installed some school laptops with firefox as their browser, even though i was told to install chrome
[07:22:37] <susi> i also configrued those firefox with sane defaults. the actual default is very far from optimal or sane :-)
[07:22:55] <susi> and it's pretty sad state we are in with firefox, ain't it?
[07:25:27] <susi> almost no users, and counting, with google being the master. big project with yearly budget over half a billion. --- the user does not matter anymore, it's simply business and is conducted as such
[07:27:24] <benl90> susi, Yes, but they tried to diversify , hopefully it works. Google will kept Moz as way to not get any anti competitive law suit, at least for now. Some Gov signed contract with Moz for support in WebApp specially with FirefoxBrowser. Hopefully it will be the other revenue stream. 
[07:27:49] <susi> still i speak *for* firefox both in real life and www, probably a lot more actively than any of you do 
[07:28:12] <susi> dunno even wwhy anymore, but i've been using firefox since the beginning
[07:28:29] <benl90> I still courage my student to use it when I teach webDev in Uni, yeah some people are more speak up than other, but it does make some different :)
[07:28:36] <susi> i'd like to view it as something beautiful it might have been in the beginning
[07:28:51] <susi> yet like i pointed out, facts dont support its beautifulness anymore
[07:29:27] <susi> i'm using firefox merely because chrome lacks some features important to me which no normal person would ever need
[07:29:54] <susi> not because i think it's anymore cool per se
[07:30:47] <susi> i have two chromebooks so i do use chrome too, daily
[07:31:07] <benl90> susi, haha.. I use firefox because a lot of feature chrome lacks.. fast and responsive UI, on old hardware, new firefox does that
[07:31:09] <susi> i know it lacks some niche things and is not as customizable
[07:31:24] <susi> what chrome lags?
[07:31:28] <benl90> susi, chrome book and android is what push chrome become king. 
[07:31:40] <susi> i dont know about historic/ancient hardware support
[07:31:44] <susi> but what you think chrome lacks?

[07:32:32] <benl90> and DOM tools as web developer, it's simpler for beginner than in chrome
[07:32:55] <susi> it lacks merely a possibility to have type-ahead-find work as in firefox, where its built-in. i have tried chrome extension for that, but it just was not as good as built-in feature in firefox
[07:33:14] <susi> and not very customizable
[07:33:39] <benl90> susi, what is that?
[07:35:23] <susi> my firefox is pretty 'heavily tuned' or configured, everything but touching source code
[07:36:01] <susi> chrome does not let me modify many things
[07:37:36] <susi> chrom://flags is pretty far from about:config. and i'm pretty sure you can't customize chrome's ui with css. dunno does it have userContent.css alternative without extension, probably no?

[07:42:06] <susi> now that i think of it, i think i have had more problems with history in firefox than chrome
[07:42:19] <susi> what difference is there?
[07:43:47] <susi> but why are we not using some actual open source community effort simple and powerful browser?
[07:44:08] <susi> i think there are good browsers out there, qutebrowser maybe?
[07:45:05] <susi> then it's more about what do you think about QtWebEngine... but guess it's pretty fine, and fine enough at least
[07:45:40] <susi> it seems to have webkit available too, so you should use qutebrowser probably
[07:46:50] <susi> firefox being the only graphical application I'm using, it almsot feels too bloated already
[07:47:19] <susi> bare minimum interface would suffice for ui
[07:48:26] <susi> I'm somewhat dependent on a couple of browser exteniosns

[13:03:04] <ede> even hexchat. 13 screens in 3 groups, 760x650 the whole dialog, but in firefox there's not a single page in the config thing where i don't have to scroll. and i'm even forced to use the mouse for all of it.
[13:05:46] <ede> i won't even start with vlc's expert mode. instead of a few icons (remember firefox options a decade ago?) there's a tree like in hexchat. and a lot more screens. and firefox users are sent all the time into the registry with its really horrible interface, it was a mess in windows95 alredy, far worse here. and its newest incarnation is even worse.

[15:26:14] <kinlo> these video's are like max 2-3 min, spending so much time fixing this issue is counterproductive - also, I don't believe a website should be able to take away features like this from the user, looking for a generic solution
[15:28:15] <ede> odd, on pluto.tv it's not always available.
[15:29:35] <ede> same for standard keybindings btw. normal to steal C-k, even history control

[15:31:50] <ede> in yt i need Shift, no icon visible. i get the other one in the PiP window later.
[15:32:20] <ede> if firefox can do this then they do a bad job in telling it the user
