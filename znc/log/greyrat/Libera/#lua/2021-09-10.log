[14:01:46] <eduardas> Habbie: so if I'm building Lua bindings for an embedded Linux distribution, there is no point in having a liblua.so packaged there in the first place?
[14:03:24] <Habbie> eduardas, well, you do need a lua implementation somewhere
[14:05:08] <eduardas> Habbie: I have the lua binary compiled separately
[14:05:15] <eduardas> i.e. the interpreter
[14:05:30] <eduardas> the interpreter binary does not use liblua.so
[14:05:31] <Habbie> right, depending on how you built it, the interpreter will be in it
[14:06:00] <Habbie> so that can work, yes :)
[14:06:02] <password> zutt ooh pizza fridays , that be awesome
[14:06:35] <password> i might as well ask in here , anyone here have sugestions for linters , specifically one that can check against naming conventiosn aswell
[14:12:53] <eduardas> Habbie: I am actually more concerned of what is the technicallly correct way of going about this. Is there a "best practice" or "common practice" here? At least in the context of Luarocks or Debian packaging?
[14:13:16] <eduardas> so that I can implement my embedded distro in a similar fashion
[14:13:53] <eduardas> I am using OpenEmbedded, but Lua support is very rudimentary there
[14:14:14] <Habbie> debian's lua binary also does not depend on liblua
[14:15:07] <Habbie> which is a weird choice if you care about diskspace
[14:16:44] <Habbie> openwrt's lua binary does depend on liblua
[14:17:00] <Habbie> which allows that binary to be only 16 kilobytes
[14:17:09] <eduardas> Habbie: do you have an opinion on which distro packages Lua and Lua bindings most correctly?
[14:17:22] <Habbie> well, debian's choice is weird to me
[14:17:27] <Habbie> because now i have the interpreter installed twice
[14:17:33] <Habbie> but 'correctness' is so absolute
[14:17:40] <Habbie> what are your needs? do you care a lot about diskspace?
[14:18:02] <eduardas> let's assume so, it is an embedded Linux distro after all
[14:18:05] <Habbie> uhuh
[14:18:08] <eduardas> similar to OpenWrt
[14:18:12] <Habbie> i kinda figured
[14:18:17] <Habbie> then i'd make the choice openwrt made here
[14:18:33] <Habbie> unless you are -certain- nothing outside of the lua binary will need liblua
[14:19:15] <RhodiumToad> having the lua binary not depend on liblua but having the interpreter statically linked in is how the upstream makefiles work
[14:19:26] <Habbie> right
[14:19:33] <Habbie> but the upstream makefiles do not help you make a .so at all, right?
[14:19:54] <RhodiumToad> having a liblua.so is not in the upstream makefiles at all but is commonly added by packagers
[14:19:56] <eduardas> Habbie: exactly. and most distros have liblua.so
[14:20:21] <Habbie> eduardas, yep
[14:20:29] <Habbie> eduardas, because at some point some app is going to need it anyway
[14:20:33] <Habbie> RhodiumToad, right, as i thought then, thanks :)
[14:20:37] <RhodiumToad> but if you add a liblua.so in the obvious way, the lua binary still ends up not using it
[14:21:05] <RhodiumToad> that would require further modification to the makefile
[14:21:17] <eduardas> RhodiumToad: so all the distro packagers are just doing it wrong?
[14:21:23] <RhodiumToad> no?
[14:21:54] <RhodiumToad> I mean you can make the lua binary link against liblua but why bother?
[14:21:58] <Habbie> eduardas, it's not useful to talk about 'right' or 'wrong' here
[14:22:08] <Habbie> RhodiumToad, why bother - diskspace is a reason
[14:22:23] <eduardas> if you have a regular lua interpreter built by default, you don't really need a library to link your bindings .so to, no?
[14:22:25] <rjek> cache hits, only one file to replace on security updates, etc
[14:22:36] <eduardas> so why build a liblua.so in the first place?
[14:23:03] <eduardas> rjek: you can just replace the lua interpreter
[14:23:19] <RhodiumToad> liblua.so is to link applications to in order to embed lua interpreters into them
[14:24:07] <eduardas> RhodiumToad: ah... but if I build only regular bindings, I don't really need to care about this?
[14:24:18] <RhodiumToad> what are "regular bindings" to you?
[14:24:40] <eduardas> RhodiumToad: something like lua-cjson or luaposix
[14:24:59] <RhodiumToad> modules that you intend to load into lua should not link to liblua regardless
[14:25:27] <eduardas> RhodiumToad: ah, that is exactly what I wanted to know
[14:25:29] <RhodiumToad> and no, you don't need to care
[14:26:00] <eduardas> RhodiumToad: is this explained somewhere? because I get the feeling a lot of Lua C API tutorials get it wrong
[14:26:16] <eduardas> RhodiumToad: people still show a gcc command like with -llua
[14:31:16] <Habbie> 09:52Z <eduardas> if you have a regular lua interpreter built by default, you don't really need a library to link your bindings .so to, no?
[14:31:20] <Habbie> if all your lua usage is via the interpreter
[14:31:26] <Habbie> this is not true for many systems

[14:33:50] <eduardas> Habbie: yes, I suppose so
[14:34:22] <Habbie> in fact most openwrt installs i do have and use liblua, but do not have /usr/bin/lua
[14:38:13] <eduardas> Habbie: that is interesting. Do you happen to know what are the most common users of liblua in the context of OpenWrt?
[14:38:46] <Habbie> in my case, powerdns auth/powerdns recursor/dnsdist
[14:39:07] <Habbie> also lots of people run knot resolver
[14:39:43] <Habbie> the 'luci' interface to openwrt also uses lua, but that one does also install /usr/bin/lua
[14:52:27] <eduardas> Habbie: so you mostly use OpenWrt installs without LuCI? I thought that was pretty uncommon
[14:53:26] <Habbie> probably true
[14:53:39] <Habbie> i'm a developer in this case, not a user
[14:54:45] <eduardas> Habbie: well, that makes sense
[14:58:47] <Habbie> anyway
[14:58:50] <Habbie> that's a lot of informatino
[14:58:53] <Habbie> information
[14:58:57] <Habbie> have we actually helped you?
[15:04:03] <eduardas> Habbie: actually, yes. Seems I was doing lua modules wrong this whole time and should not in fact try to link them to liblua.a or liblua.so
[15:04:18] <Habbie> yep
[15:04:26] <Habbie> good takeaway :)

[15:04:47] <eduardas> Habbie: my colleague was making the same mistake so no one in my environment was even aware there was some issue there
[15:05:16] <Habbie> you usually get away with it anyway
[15:05:19] <Habbie> entirely harmless
[15:05:21] <Habbie> except sometimes
[15:05:50] <eduardas> Habbie: well, not really. since OE gives only a liblua.a by default, every binding .so would get fatter
[15:06:12] <Habbie> oh!
[15:06:16] <Habbie> so they wouldn't be sharing a copy
[15:06:19] <Habbie> i missed that step
[15:06:22] <Habbie> yes that's not great
[15:06:48] <eduardas> that is the reason I was trying to create the liblua.so in OE in the first place
[15:07:25] <eduardas> but the real problem was that the module compilation was wrong
[15:07:32] <Habbie> right
[15:07:39] <eduardas> not the fact that there was no liblua.so in the distro
[15:07:59] <Habbie> but fixing -either- mistake would mostly solve the problem :D
[15:09:06] <eduardas> Habbie: well, the OpenWrt way of doing things is probably the most technically correct one, but since none of my apps run lua scripts, just fixing the custom modules will do
[15:09:13] <Habbie> yep
[15:09:15] <Habbie> makes sense
