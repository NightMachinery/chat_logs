[13:23:29] <rsaarelm> Yes, once we figured out sexual repression is the one true way evil enters the world around 1970, everyone has known the importance of being in touch with their sexuality and using it for healthy self-actualization instead of maladaptive compulsive behavior.
[13:27:10] <dbohdan> If you had the option to remove or greatly reduce your sex drive (reversibly), would you take it?
[13:28:19] <rsaarelm> I'm middle-aged enough that it would probably take me like a week to notice I have that turned on.
[13:28:44] <dbohdan> Haha
[13:28:47] <rsaarelm> But no, wouldn't feel like turning it on without some extra reason to.
[13:29:07] <Obormot\Gaia> *Reversibly*? I mean... that sounds incredibly convenient

[13:32:33] <dbohdan> rsaarelm: I think that somewhat often, but it's probably an extension of my gender issues

[16:12:35] <kuudes> there has been some push to criminalize that again, but so far it has not went anywhere. if there was international push, it would maybe go forward
[16:12:40] <kuudes> you know, slaughterhouses etc
[16:12:53] <kuudes> beefs come from cows etc
[16:13:42] <kuudes> specifically iirc the question most affected is if a woman has sex with a male dog, it usually is not that harmful for the dog

[16:24:19] <kuudes> sex work in itself is legal in finland, which has indeed put problems re trafficking criminalization
[16:24:27] <kuudes> finland was in us black list for some time because of that
[16:24:35] <kuudes> pimping is criminal
[16:25:05] <kuudes> a problem appears to be that there is trafficking from romania, as iirc romania now is in schengen
[16:25:22] <kuudes> and a crux in that is that the women in romania don't know english much
[16:25:31] <kuudes> so they can be lied to by their pimps here
[16:26:19] <kuudes> when it would be perfectly legal (aside covid stuff) for them to fly on normal finnair flight from bucharest to helsinki, sell sex for 3 months as temporary resident, and then fly back home and keep all the cash and be taxed for it only in romania
[16:26:58] <kuudes> but instead there are networks that lie to them and take their moneys and passports and tell them the police will beat them and pimp them
[16:27:50] <kuudes> and given 90% of people in romania earn less than 9000 e/y, and it seems the going rate for an intercourse in finland is ~100 e, it is not that hard to see the economic incentives
[16:28:17] <PapuaHardyNet> 100 euros for one round of sex? that's... huh
[16:28:59] <nshepperd2> unfortunate
[16:29:32] <kuudes> basicly if we actually want to reduce the suffering of the sex workers, we should buy billboards in romania in romanian language that would explain this is legal
[16:30:00] <kuudes> so that the people there considering this would do it better for themselves and cut out the violent criminals who have no actual reason to be in the thing
[16:30:35] <kuudes> before covid, a lot of people from russia did gig works re this thing
[16:30:55] <kuudes> and indeed, it is not illegal for them to come to finland as tourists and then sell sex.
[16:31:53] <kuudes> neither is buying sex illegal here, but from victims of trafficking
[16:32:03] <kuudes> in sweden and iirc in norway, buying is illegal
[16:34:05] <kuudes> and indeed what facebook does currently, ie reads all the pms between users and scans for cp, would currently be criminal if that processing happened in finland
[16:34:45] <kuudes> but as it is legal in usa, and happens in usa, then there is nothing in the matter
[16:35:23] <kuudes> imo we should having more barriers for international comms would solve this sort of legality issues best, though it is sad it would hamper international comms such as this channel

[19:39:31] <shawwwn> yis.
[19:41:32] <shawwwn> dbohdan: one could imagine augmenting the training with FFHQ data, which does contain children, without significantly affecting the results.
[19:41:32] <shawwwn> ... Maybe. or maybe it would screw up the model.
[19:42:19] <feep> eventually the model will be able to do it by just extrapolating multimodally

[23:15:28] <dbohdan> Although you'd need to clarify the question to really answer it
[23:16:53] <two2thehead> I don't understand why people think the post Frank Herbert dune books are any good
[23:16:59] <feep> to be fair, it's been ages since I'd read dune
[23:17:13] <two2thehead> One reason Dune was good, was that the author wrote very well
[23:17:24] <dbohdan> feep: Same.  I should reread it.
[23:17:40] <two2thehead> every one after him were just typical scifi dorky writing
[23:17:59] <feep> but like, wasn't it a big deal that like, the whole point of paul is that he's got access to the ancestral memory of both his male and female progenitors, and like, generally prophetic cults only have access to their own gender or sth, something something spice ritual
[23:18:05] <two2thehead> He wrote poetically, that's how I'd describe it
[23:19:26] <feep> and this somehow hooks into how the bene gesserit are -- okay, I know that they're a weird female-only breeding cult thing, but I swear there was some interplay there with using sex to control males or sth, but I think that was later and I think authors tend to go weird from book four or so
[23:19:50] <feep> and I might be mixing it up with random bad sci-fi I read lol
[23:20:00] <feep> I swear someone had a sex fight at some point
[23:20:07] <feep> that must have been book four or five
[23:20:17] <gwern> you forgot the jews
[23:20:25] <feep> I don't know if it was before or after the guy turned himself into a sandworm

[23:20:33] <feep> mm
[23:20:51] <two2thehead> that was when the honoured matres(sp?) become a problem
[23:20:54] <feep> yeah!
[23:20:59] <two2thehead> <3
[23:21:07] <feep> anyway, my prediction is we will see at *best* a throwaway reference to the gendered nature of ancestral memories
[23:22:06] <feep> oyeah, there was a bit where paul mindcontrols his recently born daughter to aim a knife attack at an assassin
[23:22:10] <feep> is that in the first or second book
[23:22:28] <gwern> (second)
[23:22:33] <feep> (ah, damn.)
[23:23:13] <feep> dude imagine if this is a duology, I really want the scene where paul just walks into the desert
[23:23:20] <feep> that'd be hype...
[23:23:53] <feep> but it won't happen, because they want to *show* the setting so bad, they want to make it visual, and you can't visualize the conceptual stuff with cgi
[23:24:19] <dbohdan> They might mention it in passing, and then Twitter would get into a fight about whether Paul Atreides is nonbinary
[23:24:27] <feep> paul atreides is futa, cmv
[23:24:42] <feep> he literally unifies the gender binary
[23:25:00] <feep> well, I say he, so I guess that answers that
[23:25:47] <feep> but I think that's more because like ... okay, first of all, I think frank never really went far into the fact that paul should I guess be psychologically genderless given the ages of shared experience he has from both sides
[23:26:03] <vrs> gwern: having looked at co2-coin more closely - I wouldn't set up auditing as slashing, but auditors ought to be able to destroy funds, even those already spent by eg airlines (because then if an airline didn't audit correctly, they find their offsets set back by a month's worth of tokens)
[23:26:19] <feep> but I think that second, what happens is, sort of, by the time you have multiple people locked into a prophetic path that both sides have access to, paul's choice of his paul body as the locus of perspective is arbitrary or habit
[23:26:58] <feep> I don't think paul can perceive, say, chani's perspective as they make love any *less* intensely than he can his own, especially post blinding
[23:27:09] <feep> it's all just prophecy sense
[23:27:44] <gwern> vrs: how would you do that? if you slash everyone's tokens, it punishes good miners. and if auditors can destroy an entire history selectively, that either incentivizes Sybils to reduce the blast radius or gives the auditors ever escalating blackmail
[23:27:58] <feep> so by the time he gets locked into the golden throne^W path, it's less paul the person and more paul the center of a massive clockwork
[23:28:51] <vrs> gwern: make offset credits non-fungible - each is tied to where it was minted
[23:29:16] <vrs> you could have derivates on top of those and those are the fungible thing
[23:30:38] <feep> - man, having sex with golden path paul would have to be *weird*.
[23:31:18] <feep> because like, sex is already not extremely free-willed, but at that point he'd be doing it because it was in some sense necessary to ensure the future, so like ... if you feel let down and unfulfilled, is that because your fulfillment wasn't necessary, only your conception?
[23:31:20] <gwern> vrs: 'where'? so like, what, some square kilomters? that sounds like it incentivizes geographic sybil attacking then, spreading things out as much as possible
[23:31:27] <feep> if you feel fulfilled, is it because your *happiness* was necessary?

[23:31:58] <feep> gwern: I mean, you couldn't help but think
[23:32:04] <feep> are you *supposed* to think of arrakis?
[23:32:11] <feep> or are you supposed to think you're supposed to?
[23:32:24] <dbohdan> The utterly canon-justified bad fanfic writes itself
[23:32:24] <feep> or are you supposed to think you're *not* supposed to?
[23:32:39] <feep> dbohdan: I mean paul is basically path to victory
[23:33:19] <vrs> gwern: I wouldn't specifically use gps coordinates either, just instructions for verification (such as, go to x,y and sample the sand depth and composition)
[23:33:26] <feep> the only reason paul's actions in the books make *any* amount of sense is that he needed to appear legible.
[23:33:31] * dbohdan stopped after the second book.  How much did I miss out on?
[23:33:36] <feep> oh man
[23:33:41] <feep> uh
[23:33:56] <feep> I can't say that it was much *good*, as I said I think authors go weird after book four
[23:34:13] <feep> you missed a dude turning himself into a giant neotenous sandworm
[23:34:15] <feep> that was pretty cool
[23:34:26] <dbohdan> Right, I keep hearing about that
[23:34:35] <feep> duncan comes back for some reason
[23:34:37] <gwern> imo the second book was the best as literature. the rest build up a lot of SF and worldbuilding, and heavily recontextualize the first two, but I'm not sure if I could really say they're good
[23:35:15] <feep> at the end a bit of sci-fi happens and then paul's children fulfill the plan using technobabble and oppression
[23:35:43] <gwern> I think if you read D/DM and you understand the construction/deconstruction of the duology, you've gotten much of the value out of it. the rest, about the hierarchy of prescience or the nature of warfare or the long-term fate of humanity and 'becoming adult' is... interesting but not especially compelling and the writing got steadily worse
[23:36:02] <feep> otoh. sexfight.
[23:36:12] <feep> you know, I've bought books for less.
[23:36:35] <feep> then again, I liked the ender sequels too.
[23:36:39] <dbohdan> Okay, so rereading the first two is what I should do.  It isn't like I remember them well, especially not the second.  Then if I crave more I'll go on.
[23:36:42] <dbohdan> Thanks!
[23:36:42] * gwern buys a ticket online for _the green knight_ on tuesday. we'll see how well this whole 'send qr code to email address' business works. if I wind up waiting 30 minutes in line *again* and missing much of the movie, well, it'll be a long time before I go back
[23:36:59] <feep> dbohdan: yeah, bout right!
[23:37:42] <vrs> gwern: also btw the chia folks have on-chain carbon offsets in their roadmap, and are sitting on money they're willing to spend on cool projects
[23:38:26] <feep> dbohdan: you should read golden oecumene instead
[23:38:52] <feep> it has one of the cleverest twist solutions I've ever seen in sci-fi.
[23:39:24] <feep> (fair warning: it is not overtly conservative, but the author's conservative worldview shines through it.)
[23:39:32] <dbohdan> dbohdan: I went to bookmark it.  It was already bookmarked.
[23:39:45] <dbohdan> feep: I mean, I read and write review of 0HPL
[23:39:49] <dbohdan> *reviews
[23:39:49] <feep> fair fair
[23:40:03] <feep> yeah relative to that wright is tame
[23:40:36] <feep> it's just very bootstraps, great men of history, objective morality - but it takes the notion of objective morality and goes to a *really cool place* with it.
[23:41:15] <vrs> gwern: I'm not sure they already wrote it down anywhere, but I can hook you up - then again, their answer will likely be "yeah we'll hold a hackathon about this in a year"
[23:41:39] <feep> like, one of the mysteries of the series is, and this is not a spoiler cause it's part of the setup, like, the idea is, there is an objectively correct morality and any AI you build rapidly converges onto it. so. how can you have hostile action?
[23:42:34] <gwern> vrs: unless you already have the design, dunno what good a hackathon will do
[23:42:46] <vrs> coming up with designs!
[23:42:55] <feep> but it also really shines into the dune themes of the follies of trying to control outcomes as well
[23:43:19] <vrs> maybe s/hackathon/competition/
[23:43:39] <vrs> I can think of shooting CO2 into space for example
[23:43:53] <vrs> (bad idea but very verifiable)
[23:44:27] <gwern> by what, spectra? yeah, until it diffuses too much for verification, I suppose
[23:44:27] <feep> dbohdan: but it's also really cool in that it's a post-singularity setting, kind of, in that these are a people who just ... like, every thousand years or so they just come together and have a singularity
[23:44:31] <feep> and then they stop having one again
[23:44:45] <feep> just get it out of their systems
[23:44:54] <vrs> spectra, and having it go down another gravity well ideally
[23:44:57] <feep> which is really cool in that it lets you basically justify anything :D
[23:45:16] <vrs> moon and mars need atmospheres anyway
[23:45:23] <feep> but it also lets you have a stable society with limited power.
[23:45:41] <gwern> (I imagine establishing orbits which don't take it back to earth is pretty trivial, no need to actually dump down a gravity well. and might make it a lot more expensive to launch)
[23:46:15] <gwern> (and what would be the point of the moon? it'd just immediately start losing it all, the way it lost any original atmosphere and all offgassing since)
[23:46:40] <vrs> getting off earth is already very expensive, and as I said, bad idea
[23:46:46] <feep> if you can pull co2 out of the atmosphere, you can just ... like... *not* shoot it into space
[23:47:01] <vrs> feep: problem then is proving it doesn't seep back
[23:47:15] <feep> Iguess
[23:47:23] <vrs> the weathering approach gwern proposes is pretty good in that regard
[23:49:55] <vrs> but if you generalize the approach to any sort of sequestration (and verification instructions), and make the whole thing nonfungible, you can solve the fungibility via derivates ("sequestered X amount of carbon at YY% probablity, Z error bars, under T threat model")
[23:52:57] <vrs> as long as you have competition between derivates (and approaches), I think the thing ought to keep itself honest well
[23:53:03] <dbohdan> feep: Oh, that's interesting.  The only thing I've read that this reminds me of not fiction but Nick Land's blog.  Land thinks AI will converge on objective morality (or die), and the objective morality is intelligence maximization.
[23:54:58] <dbohdan> *is not fiction
[23:55:16] <mst> I mean, in the case of Nick Land, it's kinda of a fine line
[23:56:09] <feep> dbohdan: well, ironically, wright disagrees about the objective moral outcome :P
[23:58:49] <dbohdan> mst: While Land writes, or at least has written, "theory-fiction", the stuff about non-orthogonality he really believes (as far as anyone can tell with Land).  It's a cornerstone of his worldview.
[23:59:20] <dbohdan> feep: He wouldn't be a conservative if he agreed
