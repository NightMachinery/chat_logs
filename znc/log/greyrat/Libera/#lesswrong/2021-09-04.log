[00:05:27] <shawwwn> my point to RiversHaveWings was, if you're having trouble writing things up -- or doing writeups in general -- then I urge you to try out notion
[00:05:50] <gwern> (yes yes, notion is a dynamic interpreted language and gwern.net is a static compiled language, but both paradigms have their disadvantages...)
[00:05:52] <pompolic> savvy hackers know that the remaining 10% is the remaining 90%
[00:06:04] <shawwwn> it's really a fucking pain in the ass to learn (https://shawwn.notion.site/shawwn/Episode-1-Figuring-Things-Out-eef1c32410434c8c8f8316ea6954c0ed#bec651c3bc9e4ff7a9d41e87e1ae0c39)

[00:16:38] <gwern> (ok I see the problem, it was while I was misunderstanding the Attr type and for an empty set of key-values, wrote [("","")] instead of []... but pandoc shouldn't be generating bullshit keys like that)

[00:20:35] <gwern> adiabatic: no, it's also a pandoc mistake because I'm checking the standard now, and keys *cannot* be empty strings
[00:20:43] <gwern> it's just wrong in generating any data- at all

[00:39:10] <feep> gwern: gonna just strip spaces for now, please re-ping if it ever happens that punctuation is an issue

[00:41:12] <feep> anyway I'm pretty sure the *docs* from that time are dead.
[00:42:19] <feep> so I'd have to write a custom strip(), and that's like ten minutes, but it's an annoying ten minutes
[00:42:38] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Arcturus, chrome://extensions (when Developer mode is turned on) has a button Load unpacked in the upper left and as far as i thought it's supposed to apply to a repository like yours
[00:42:40] <feep> (it's only ten minutes because "scan for previous unicode character from the back"; idk, I might be able to get away without that, not sure)
[00:45:12] <kuudes> have you found new ideas what causes the inversion?
[00:45:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Yeah? And what's the problem?
[00:48:06] <Gurkenglas> when i apply it to C:\Users\Gurkenglas\AlwaysKillSticky\src\platform\chrome I get "Could not load options page 'options.html'. Could not load manifest.".

[00:50:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: If you load src/chrome, that's not actually an unpacked extension, it's just a source directory...
[00:50:14] <otoburb> The drama in question risks alienating your existing readership?

[00:50:49] <kuudes> yeah, thats one part of it
[00:50:50] <Gurkenglas> no, i guessed that might be required in addition rather than alternatively, but then i needed to install php first and that wants me to restart the PC and uhhh i have 44 GB ram used

[01:48:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: But why, though? What are you trying to accomplish?
[01:48:19] <Betawolf> 'you use it, you broke it' 
[01:49:41] <Gurkenglas> the trigger was having to wait for the pageload. the fuel was procrastinating on what I'm supposed to do. the passion was seeing code in need of kneading

[01:56:10] <Gurkenglas> the querySelectorAllDeep thing is just what caused the import that was holding me up; the actual solution was, I hope, to go mutation.addedNodes.forEach(killStickies) instead of killStickies(mutation.target)
[01:59:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Are you working off the assumption that the only way for a new sticky to appear is for a new node to be added, which is sticky?
[02:00:02] <Gurkenglas> or for an existing node to get its attributes changed to sticky
[02:00:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> What do you mean by "get its attributes changed", though?
[02:00:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Mutation observers don't notify you of changes to computed attributes, you know
[02:01:09] <Gurkenglas> when MutationRecordType is "attributes"
[02:01:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> *computed properties, rather
[02:02:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, your assumption is wrong, you see
[02:02:09] <Gurkenglas> you mean, an element might say "im sticky whenever the time is 0.1 seconds after im added" and that dodges everything?
[02:02:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> No
[02:02:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean that if I inject a style element
[02:02:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> It could change the position property of arbitrary elements in the DOM
[02:03:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> And you will not get any mutation notifications for any of those elements
[02:03:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because the change will be to computed CSS properties
[02:03:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> And injected CSS is fairly common

[02:04:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Correct
[02:07:48] <saturn2> you could try to read the stylesheet
[02:08:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, that's an optimization, I guess, but it'd add a lot of complexity

[06:53:52] <ggreer> > The victim was stopped at the intersection, a vehicle pulled up, one male exited the vehicle, pointed a gun at the victim and ordered him out of his vehicle and then subsequently shot the victim in the leg. The other male attempted to steal victim vehicle; however, it has a manual transmission, and they were apparently unable to drive it away.  The suspects fled the scene.
[06:56:39] <gwern> ggreer: hah, let's see your tesla have a manual transmission! oh wait! WHERE'S YOUR MUSK NOW
[06:57:10] <ggreer> https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/phe4et/i_got_shot_last_night_and_they_couldnt_even_drive/ the victim is answering questions on reddit. apparently the gunshot didn't hit anything important and he'll be fine

[10:20:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Baked a quickbread in my cast iron loaf pan. Came out amazing. So far this seems to have been an excellent purchase
[10:23:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> (It was a chocolate swirl spiced pumpkin bread, with my homemade roasted butternut squash puree in place of store-bought pumpkin puree. Delicious)
[10:25:40] <adiabatic> that sounds fantastic
[10:25:58] <adiabatic> I haven't made anything‚Ä¶_new_ in months
[10:31:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://www.seriouseats.com/marble-pumpkin-chocolate-quick-bread is the recipe, but I modified it bit. Reduced the spice quantity, for one (1.5 tsp cinnamon is totally insane, I made it 0.25 tsp; likewise 0.25 tsp each of nutmeg/cloves, also added same amount of allspice). Instead of the "1/2 plus a scant 1/8 tsp baking soda", I used 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/8 tsp baking powder (because I am pretty sure my squash puree is
[10:31:06] <Obormot\Arcturus>  less acidic than the canned pumpkin stuff). For the chocolate, I used some leftover dark chocolate ganache, which was made with butter, cream, and bittersweet chocolate, rather than milk and cocoa powder.
[10:31:06] <Robomot> Marble Pumpkin Chocolate Bread Recipe (Moist and spicy pumpkin bread with swirls of chocolate is perfect for the Halloween season. And you just need a bowl and a whisk to make it.)
[10:32:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also I spooned the ganache directly into the batter and swirled that, rather than whisking it into batter first to make chocolate batter. So there's veins of chocolate running through the loaf.
[10:33:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Baking time was ~80 minutes.
[10:33:27] <nshepperd2> nice
[10:34:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh yes, and I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup (to 1.5 cups from 1.75). Should've reduced it even further tbh, 1 1/3 would've sufficed. American recipes are ludicrously sweet
[10:34:48] <nshepperd2> yeah i was going to ask
[10:35:00] <nshepperd2> 1 3/4 cup is an awful lot
[10:35:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah it is
[10:36:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> As written it's way too sweet and way too spicy, but thankfully these things are easily fixable
[10:37:11] <nshepperd2> 'Whisk sugar, oil, pumpkin, eggs, pumpkin, and salt in a large bowl until combined.' *squint*

[10:40:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> That instruction works out fine
[10:40:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh they say "pumpkin" twice lol
[10:40:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> I didn't even notice that
[10:40:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> BUT you should sift together the dry stuff first
[10:41:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> One of the comments is "I didn't sift before mixing in, as the instructions indeed do not tell me to do, and the result was bad", which is plausibly the result of poor distribution of baking soda through batter, say
[10:42:47] <nshepperd2> don't you usually mix wet and dry ingredients separately with quickbreads
[10:43:04] <nshepperd2> kind of odd that this recipe doesn't

[12:48:59] <Obormot\Gaia> "Spelljammer got its start in 1988 ‚Ä¶ It was a department-wide brainstorming meeting at a local bar and grill.
[12:48:59] <Obormot\Gaia> ‚ÄúI remember sitting there and saying, ‚ÄòWhat about D&D in space?‚Äô‚Äù says designer Jeff Grubb. ‚ÄúAt first they didn‚Äôt get it so I started describing a guy in plate mail armor standing on the deck of a ship that was sailing through outer space.‚Äù

[12:48:59] <Obormot\Gaia> ‚ÄúI said, I didn‚Äôt know. So they told me that it made no sense. And I said, ‚ÄòI know, but we‚Äôre talking about a world with dragons and magic.

[12:49:32] <rsaarelm> I've seen a bunch of statements to the effect of the last major discovery in the 20th century fundamental physics feeding frenzy that started with Planck and Einstein in the 1900s happened somewhere around 1980 to 1984, and things have been stagnant since.

[13:27:26] <rsaarelm> Though nicely the problem is fixed whenever you can describe your table as having a variable number of rows, and most table-like data has a fixed number of columns and a variable number of rows so this thing works out.

[15:35:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, if you want a queer icon from Soviet animation, it's gotta be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Puppy
[15:35:04] <Robomot> Blue Puppy - Wikipedia (Blue Puppy (Russian: –ì–æ–ª—É–±–æ–π —â–µ–Ω–æ–∫, translit. Goluboy shchenok, alternative translations - Pale Blue Puppy/Slate puppy) is a 1976 Soviet animated film. The lyrics and screenplay were written by Yuri Entin, loosely based on the tale by Gyula Urban. ‚Ä¶)
[15:35:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is a case of *absolutely amazing* coincidence
[15:35:49] <pompolic> to introduce further confusion, sometimes they get female actors to dub young male characters
[15:36:09] <pompolic> well, it confused my brain for a while until i saw the credits
[15:36:28] <quanticle> Huh, all right.
[15:36:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> So the protagonist of this one is a puppy, who happens to be blue (actually light blue / cyan, i.e., "goluboy" - recall that Russian has more common words for "blue" than English)
[15:36:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Which is why Russian speakers have superior shade discrimination in that part of the spectrum, btw)
[15:37:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, so the Blue Puppy is bullied for being different, right
[15:37:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> The other dogs don't want to play with him and make fun of him and so on
[15:37:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then his home gets attacked and an evil pirate captures him
[15:38:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> BUT he is rescued
[15:38:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> By a good Sailor
[15:38:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who informs the titular Puppy that it's ok to be Blue
[15:38:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> And he is special and awesome
[15:39:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> And also this pirate is ... well, see for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glyX59FnvSI
[15:39:07] <Robomot> –Ø –º–æ—Ä—è–∫ –º–æ—Ä—è–∫ –±—ã–≤–∞–ª—ã–π –ì–æ–ª—É–±–æ–π —â–µ–Ω–æ–∫ - YouTube
[15:39:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> His character design literally consists of flowers, and butterflies flutter around him
[15:39:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> er, the sailor, rather
[15:39:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> The one who rescues the puppy
[15:40:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, on the one hand, this is an *extremely obvious allegory*, right
[15:40:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> It would be very hard to get any more obvious than this
[15:40:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now add to this two facts:
[15:40:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. The word "goluboy", i.e. the Blue that the Puppy in question is, is slang for "gay" in Russian.
[15:41:15] <rsaarelm> Now I made the connection that I actually read books with Cheburashka in it as a kid. It was translated as 'Muksis', basically 'oopsie-daisy'.
[15:41:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. But it *wasn't slang for "gay" at the time the cartoon was made*!
[15:41:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e., in actual fact, all of this was completely unintentional on the creator's part
[15:41:57] <rsaarelm> I guess Uspensky was moderately big in Finnish children's book market ca 1985.
[15:42:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's just a gigantic coincidence that he ended up making what turned out to be *literally the most obvious allegory* for gay kids being bullied that it was humanly possible to make
[15:44:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Of course, the cartoon is wonderful even if you don't know any of this, because it's masterfully made and they got some top-notch talent to do the voice work and songs, which are super catchy, etc.)

[20:14:07] <quanticle> gwern: I listened to a podcast featuring the author of _The Afghanistan Papers_, and honestly? The dude's a total douche
[20:14:21] <quanticle> Everything he wrote came out in the SIGAR Afghanistan reports
[20:14:43] <gwern> but narcotized
[20:15:09] <quanticle> Well, it's more like he took a bunch of interviews that were conducted off the record
[20:15:14] <quanticle> And published them on the record
[20:15:19] <quanticle> Like, kind of a dick move IMO
[20:15:57] <quanticle> And it's one thing when it's something like a general, or someone else reasonably high up in the bureaucracy
[20:16:10] <quanticle> But he also has a bunch of interviews on the record from pretty junior people
[20:17:03] <quanticle> And when his interlocutors pressed him about it, "Like, don't you think you just ruined a bunch of people's careers to satisfy your ego," he was like, "BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE TO KNOW"
[20:17:19] <quanticle> At which point they pointed, out, "Yeah, literally everything you wrote got published anyway"

[21:17:16] <quanticle> nshepperd2: Okay, both the Cuban and the Vietnamese pre-revolutionary regimes were basically right-wing dictatorships. The people from those regimes who made it to the United States tended to be pretty hard core right-wing anti-Communists. This is why, for example, the Latinx community in Florida has tended to vote Republican.

[21:19:09] <nshepperd2> quanticle: and in the vietnam war... the us allied with the right wing dictatorship, right? because the other guys were communists?
[21:19:21] <gwern> (I'd be very right-wing too if I'd fled castro after all of the executions, torture, expropriation etc, abandoning everything I had in the world, and arrived in the USA to hear democrats talk about how they don't condone such excesses of course but look at the cuban maternal mortality numbers and how they've democratized access to healthcare!)
[21:19:30] <quanticle> Well, in Vietnam the US sort of created the right-wing dictatorship 
[21:19:37] <two2thehead> IIRC most military historians and analysts like World War 2 because it is, for lack of a better word, well documented and has a LOT of samples in their sample set
[21:20:04] <two2thehead> I mean, the latest Azerbaijan-Armenian war was interesting but it was relatively small and short
[21:20:25] <two2thehead> So... i think it can only help to be aware of the Ur-Example. The Ur-War, if you will
[21:21:24] <quanticle> gwern: I think it's an open question as to whether, for the average Cuban, the Batista government was all that much better. I would argue that it's more likely that the Batista government would have *become* better (in the same way that Korea became better after Park's military dictatorship). But at the time of the takeover, I'm not sure it was such a clear cut difference.
[21:22:06] <quanticle> After all, it's not as if Batista or Pinochet or the Kuomintang were all that respectful of human rights either.
[21:22:26] <quanticle> It's just that they managed the economy better and were easier to overthrow

[21:59:25] <Robomot> History of Strasbourg - Wikipedia (Strasbourg is a city in the historic Alsace region on the left bank of the Rhine. Founded by the Romans in 12 BC, the city passed under the control of the Merovingians in the eighth century, and then became part of the Holy Roman Empire. Flourishing throughout the middle ages and Renaissance, it was conquered by Louis XIV in 1681. ‚Ä¶)
[21:59:37] <quanticle> I guess that's a reasonable place to put a EU parliament
[21:59:46] <rmmh> kuudes: potentially? It manifests as high latencies and forced resets, but the card doesn't have dedicated cooling 
[22:00:07] <rmmh> It seems more correlated to other bus traffic, really-- usually crashes after I sit down and turn on the display 
[22:00:25] <quanticle> Weird EMF
[22:00:35] <kuudes> you could try to put an external cooling to it, like a tabletop fan to it?
[22:00:41] <rmmh> Or kernel bugs
[22:01:03] <kuudes> I have noticed at least my home router seems to heat so that it feels hot to hand
[22:04:15] <rmmh> I put a fan on my modem and router for that reason, and it helped
[22:04:39] <kuudes> nice
[22:04:41] <rmmh> Wifi is just insanely power hungry compared to ethernet 
[22:04:56] <kuudes> well, the "wire" is quite much larger
[22:05:19] <kuudes> also each of the transmitters in the unregulated frequency competes with each other
[22:05:33] <kuudes> one thing you could try is to change the channel to the other end of the spectrum?
[22:05:51] <kuudes> if all of your neighbours have the default config, maybe the other end would be free?
[22:06:21] <rmmh> Not much congestion, especially in 5ghz band
[22:06:45] <kuudes> in my previous work, we covered the corporate wifi base stations with aluminium foil to get the airspace for our noncorporate wifi...
[22:06:58] <kuudes> 5 ghz does not go through the walls well though
[22:07:18] <kuudes> so if you have devices in other rooms, that will increase the energy consumption to the max
[22:07:32] <gwern> rmmh: how much more power hungry?
[22:10:21] <rmmh> APs can transmit at 200mW for 5ghz, compared to 400mW usage for gigabit, but there must be decent efficiency losses for RF
[22:11:05] <rmmh> the router as a whole might be 10-20W
[22:12:10] <Ralith> reported a bug to the driver maintainers?
[22:12:25] <Ralith> that kind of crap seems very typical of driver bugs to me
[22:12:27] <rmmh> I searched and found tons of people with the same issue
[22:12:40] <rmmh> some claiming that kernel/firmware fucker helped
