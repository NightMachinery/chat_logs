[22:54:03] <Arrinao> Hey, is there a way to perform .apply() with lambda over multiple rows the same way it's possible over multiple cols?
[22:54:45] <Arrinao> I mean df['new']=df.apply(lambda x: x['colA']+x['colB'], axis=1) works
[22:54:46] <mefistofeles> Arrinao: wow, third time?
[22:54:46] <mefistofeles> xD
[22:55:00] <Arrinao> I'm not asking the same quesiton am I ? :DDD
[22:55:08] <mefistofeles> haha ok
[22:55:45] <Arrinao> I mean df['new']=df.apply(lambda x: x.loc['rowA']+x.loc['rowB'], axis=0) doesn't work
[22:56:22] <mefistofeles> ah yes
[22:56:26] <mefistofeles> it's the same question :/
[22:56:31] <Arrinao> -.-
[22:56:42] <Arrinao> let me search through history :/
[22:57:40] <Arrinao> nah it's not the same actually
[22:58:01] <Arrinao> I was asking about the position of an arg, I later resolved it myself
[22:58:27] <Arrinao> this time I want to know if it's possible to perform row operations the same way the col operations
[22:58:51] <mefistofeles> you have been ignoring my suggestions from the beginning anyways, I won't even bother this time
[23:00:20] <mefistofeles> I mean, it's okay that you find your way, but not sure why you keep asking the same and ignoring alternative suggestions
[23:01:13] <Arrinao> well I'm now focused on solving it this way, I know you can do it the other way, I'm just exploring the possibilities
[23:01:45] <Arrinao> if I'm trying to do the impossible here, just tell me lol
[23:04:30] <mefistofeles> you are doing it the hard way, not sure what you are trying to get out of it
[23:05:10] <Arrinao> knowledge that it can be done I guess
[23:05:42] <Arrinao> yeah, maybe I'm weird, again I just like to explore possibilites 
[23:05:48] <mefistofeles> yeah, but you've been dealing with this for weeks, I don't think your knowledge is improving much, maybe a change of approach is desireable, specially when alternatives have been suggested
[23:06:16] <mefistofeles> and then you can go back to it when you have a better knowledge of the API and pandas objects
[23:06:23] <Arrinao> actually I made quite a progress since, I've just been reviewing stuff
[23:06:24] <mefistofeles> just as a suggestion, of course
