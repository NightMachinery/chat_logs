[00:41:48] <[itchyjunk]> So what does "interface" really mean?
[00:42:05] <[itchyjunk]> in java, it meant like a contract of all the methods an object promises to have
[00:42:26] <[itchyjunk]> but haskell also has interfaces
[00:42:27] <Decker> yup a plugin your wall is an inteface - it's a contract with another configuration of space that lets it work
[00:42:32] <sonny> in what sense, the Java sense or in general?
[00:42:42] <[itchyjunk]> but haskell has no objects, but the idea is the same?
[00:42:57] <[itchyjunk]> is there a difference between java and general interfaces in other languages?
[00:43:01] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: the word interface just means "the description of thing between you and the implementation"
[00:43:16] <Decker> it has a foreign function interface
[00:43:51] <[itchyjunk]> like Inegral or Num is an interface
[00:43:53] <JanC> "interface" can mean many different things
[00:44:03] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[00:44:08] <[itchyjunk]> i think i vaguely understand it
[00:44:13] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: yes, it doesn't tell you how the thing is implemented but it's a description of how you can use it.
[00:44:20] <[itchyjunk]> too bad a lot of things are intuition based with no formal definition :D
[00:44:24] <sonny> it has cultural context as well
[00:44:27] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: the interface is like, the thing you interact with

[00:44:39] <[itchyjunk]> bjs, that makes sense
[00:44:40] <JanC> e.g. Turbo/Borland Pascal used the "Interface section" of a "unit" to define its public API
[00:44:43] <Decker> there's an interface between air and liquid

[02:37:58] <[itchyjunk]> lol
[02:38:31] <arahael> phogg: another point of confusion is that  "when do you know when to stop"... well...  haskell is lazy evaluated, and you exploit this.
[02:38:34] <phogg> whether we're talking about a container or a the values in a container isn't important to my point, namely that the only thing remotely complicated about it is going to be how you track the list that ends up having all the values

[06:14:32] <Raziel> I have to ask, are design patterns a meme?
[06:14:52] <Raziel> because every time I look into one it looks like a far more complex and unnecessary way to do that particular thing than it requires
[06:14:57] *** Quits: fernand (~fernand@179.156.35.4) (Quit: Connection closed)
[06:15:28] <apotheon> Why do I think that when you say "meme" you mean "a commonly believed untruth", even though that's not the meaning of the word "meme"?
[06:15:38] *** Joins: EdFletcher (~PKD@user/edfletcher)
[06:15:47] <Raziel> no, I mean "funny although not necessarily intentionally so"
[06:15:58] <apotheon> That's not what "meme" means, either.
[06:16:16] <Raziel> indeed, it does not, per se. :p
[06:16:24] *** Joins: fernand (~fernand@179.156.35.4)
[06:16:56] <apotheon> A meme is like a gene; it is a mental (rather than genetic) pattern that replicates in a manner similar similar to how genes do it.
[06:17:14] <apotheon> . . . so your question confused the hell out of me.
[06:17:44] <apotheon> I've encountered the idea that a design pattern is a feature missing from your programming language.
[06:18:17] <Raziel> yes, although its use especially on the internet is a little bit different, although the original idea is still present in the way they spread
[06:18:21] <vdamewood> apotheon: Whether it was needed or not, anyway?
[06:18:22] <Raziel> either way, memes aside.
[06:18:25] <apotheon> On the other hand, when speaking about the overcomplexity of design patterns, it's helpful to remember that they were first somewhat formally presented in the context of Java.
[06:18:45] <apotheon> . . . so there's a certain amount of unavoidable complexity, just because of that.
[06:18:59] <vdamewood> I like to use the term 'image macro' for that other kind of 'meme'.
[06:19:05] <Raziel> that makes sense to an extent, since java loves its boilerplate, and its extremely strict OOP style
[06:19:11] <apotheon> vdamewood: yes, good term
[06:19:50] <apotheon> Raziel: There is evidently no reasonable way to use dependency injection in Java without a special library.
[06:20:00] <Raziel> I was looking at the state pattern, and it's like, you really want me to create and immediately destroy a whole new derived object when I change some state? surely you jest
[06:20:17] <vdamewood> apotheon: Can't you just use an interface for dependency injection in Java?
[06:20:31] <apotheon> Raziel: In Ruby context, there's a different way to refer to "dependency injection" -- "Just pass the object to it."
[06:20:34] <vdamewood> apotheon: Or was that a comment on the state of developing in Java in general?
[06:20:44] <Raziel> hmmm
[06:21:10] <vdamewood> Raziel: Sounds like functional programming
[06:21:47] <apotheon> vdamewood: I think (and I'm vague on this), as I recall, that there's a library often used to ease the process of using an interface, without which you are likely to get rickety bullshit that will come back to bite you later.
[06:22:07] <Raziel> does it? I suppose if you're allergic to holding data outside of functions at all it would have more value
[06:22:09] <vdamewood> apotheon: I'm unfamiliar with it.
[06:22:40] <apotheon> okay
[06:22:51] <vdamewood> Raziel: Well, specifically the tendency of FP to use functions that take objects, and return objects in their modified form instead of modifying the state of the object itself.
[06:23:06] <apotheon> I haven't even looked sideways at Java code in earnest for half a dozen years, so I only recall the most vague shit about it.
[06:23:14] <apotheon> mostly the icky feeling
[06:23:29] * vdamewood hands apotheon some Sumatra
[06:23:35] <Raziel> right, I don't see anything wrong with that in theory. what I was looking at specifically that made me go wtf was this https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/state/cpp/1

[11:19:28] <Tazy> If it panned out that some design doesn't work that is a different thing
[11:22:15] <arahael> Tazy: The good thing about microservices is that you can also consider writing a proof of concept in a more efficient langauge.
[11:26:14] <arahael> Tazy: And there are also more efficient formats than json, however, I'm not actually suggesting them yet as it sounds like your problem is serialization, usually the issue is with deserialization.
[11:26:48] <Tazy> well both are slow. But the payloads are stupidly big of just json
[11:27:56] <arahael> There's always going to be a performance cost with marshalling. How much json are we talking about?

[11:29:05] <Tazy> arahael, but as I found, the code wasn't using streams either 
[11:29:17] <arahael> Ah, that's definitely a factor.
[11:29:26] <Tazy> so get the data back, and then convert it to string, then only run deserialization on it 
[11:29:29] <arahael> json parsers exist that can exceed 3 Gbps.
[11:30:37] <arahael> Tazy: Once you've got this going, I might suggest maybe giving a non-JSON format a go?
[11:30:48] <Tazy> yeah utf8json is fast, but not really maintained
[11:32:17] <Tazy> oh so 7.7Mb, on 157 cars, that needs to go to 500

[13:38:48] <pyzozord> pulse: as far as I can tell this situation has been somewhat weaponized against you, you fell into a troll trap
[13:38:52] <Gamah> especially on irc at ungodly hours of a tuesday morning
[13:39:04] <pulse> I think my original assessment that I shouldn't talk to Hash was right on the money
[13:39:08] <pulse> pyzozord, Yeah
[13:39:10] <Gamah> and yet here we are
[13:39:13] <Hash> Wow. I feel lke I want to fucking shoot my self in the brain.
[13:39:15] <mrig> Hash, can I have a quick work in PM please?
[13:39:17] <Hash> Jeez. 
[13:39:28] <Hash> This guy, just wson't stop.!
[13:39:29] <Hash> WTF
[13:39:44] <pulse> Hash, Again I will ask you to tell me how I offended you, and if you can't do that I'll just call you a troll and be done with it
[13:39:46] <Gamah> Raziel: what langs do you use most?
[13:39:47] <mobidrop> Raziel, it could be that you're touching mental traumas when in deep meditation; or are afraid of altered consciousness
[13:39:50] <Hash> Idon't care.
[13:39:53] <pulse> At least quote the part that offended you or something
[13:39:55] <Hash> You speaking to emj at all is offendingme rightnow
[13:39:58] <Hash> polease stop
[13:39:58] <mrig> Gamah what! It is coffee oclock here!
[13:40:00] <Hash> speak to me another day
[13:40:02] <Hash> stop
[13:40:11] <Gamah> mrig: shit... i'm still sipping rum, stupid drugs
[13:40:49] <mrig> yuck! the thought of sipping rum :P
[13:40:55] <Gamah> well rum and coke
[13:41:00] <mrig> Each to their own I say.
[13:41:05] <Gamah> of course
[13:41:08] <Gamah> i wouldn't have it any other way!
[13:41:08] <pulse> Rum does taste nice. Probably the best tasting alcoholic beverage out there ;-)
[13:41:14] <Raziel> mobidrop, I don't think it's trauma, and it's never anything scary per se. it's usually just... someone's face/head just popping up above me, looking at me, and the suddennes of it jerks me out of the state. I dunno who it's supposed to be.
[13:41:15] <tomathy> Hash: are u ok bud
[13:41:16] <mrig> oh even worse mixed with a shead load of sugar!
[13:41:22] <Gamah> pulse: i don't think you should promote the use of drugs like that.... *eyeroll*
[13:41:25] <Raziel> Gamah, C++ nowadays. I've used Java quite a bit in the past.
[13:41:38] <pulse> Gamah, Agreed :-S
[13:41:54] <Gamah> i do need to get some more bumbu tho... banana rum or whatever it is
[13:41:55] <Gamah> mmm
[13:42:05] <tomathy> Hash: dont do the shooty thing, try to calm down and relax, go for a walk
[13:42:22] <mobidrop> Raziel, I've heard of others getting disturbing visions before, you could just note it and then return your attention to the meditation object
[13:42:22] <novns> Raziel, why so object oriented?
[13:42:57] <Raziel> novns, my current C++ workings tend to stay away from object oriented design when possible, I've been trying to do ECS and stuff more instead
[13:43:05] <Gamah> what's the most popular non-OOP lang these days? C? and of people who say they're using "C" and not "C++" how many of them aren't just doing their own OOP implementaiton
[13:43:07] <Raziel> still a bit difficult to adapt some things but it's fun

[13:43:31] <tomathy> Raziel: sounds like it's your unconscious just trying to block you from a higher realm, persist
[13:43:39] <Raziel> mobidrop, I suppose when I've tried I wasn't meditating upon an object or anything specific, just trying to empty everything, meditate on the void
[13:43:42] <Gamah> i guess signall processing and process automation isn't very OOP
[13:43:58] <Raziel> but yes, I should try it some more, if I can find the time and/or patience 
[13:44:17] <mobidrop> Raziel, I'd just handle it in the same way as persistent thoughts
[13:44:29] <Raziel> Gamah, I guess basic state machines aren't really oop even though they can easily be seen as such :p
[13:44:51] <Raziel> or, implemented in such
[13:44:54] <Gamah> Raziel: arguably even c++ complies to state machines.....
[13:45:00] <novns> Gamah, C++ as C with classes is ok, but templates make it messy, hard to debug and too much time wasting
[13:45:12] <Raziel> oop is a way to structure things, for the most part, no?
[13:45:24] <tomathy> i hope he's ok
[13:45:26] <Gamah> i though oop was also about inheretence and stuff too
[13:45:36] <Raziel> you can structure/model signal processing and process automation with oop, even though it wouldn't be a great idea most of the time
[13:45:38] <Gamah> tomathy: weren't you just egging him on eariler? weird turn of events
[13:45:46] <Raziel> well, yes, that's part of the way it models things
[13:45:51] <pyzozord> inheritance is a way to structure
[13:46:02] <tomathy> Gamah: i find suggestion of taking psychedelics to be an assault on my mind
[13:46:13] <tomathy> but i dont want him to sepuku over it
[13:46:15] <Gamah> and so retaliation is the correct reponse?
[13:46:16] <Raziel> lol
[13:46:29] <pyzozord> just move on from this topic
[13:46:31] <novns> Raziel, OOP is about objects that send messages to other objects all over the place, classes with methods are a compromise for bringing OOP to procedural languages
[13:46:37] <mrig> hah
[13:46:55] <Raziel> novns, sure, that doesn't change anything though
[13:46:55] <mrig> inheritance and OOP are a no go area these days ;)
[13:47:03] <Gamah> <tomathy> Hash: is there a giant monster on the horizon?
[13:47:07] <Gamah> just saying, this was certainly not helping
[13:47:14] <mrig> Gamah why the need to stir?
[13:47:27] <Gamah> mrig: just hoping he might reflect on it and think about being a better huma in the future, i want everyone to get along! :)
[13:47:32] <tomathy> Gamah: you think i fucking give a shit i am protecting the human species from an alien invader
[13:47:32] <novns> Raziel, it limits you, you cannot send a broadcast message to all objects by calling a methof
[13:47:35] <novns> *method
[13:47:46] <Gamah> mrig: i digress...
[13:48:01] <Gamah> novns: you can loop over them though
[13:48:02] <Raziel> that seems more like an issue with implementation rather than anything else though
[13:48:04] <mrig> Gamah perhpas their soul purpose for this incarnation is to test you right here and right now?
[13:48:05] <Gamah> there is no limitation in the language
[13:48:27] *** Quits: Twipply (~Twipply@user/twipply) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[13:48:29] <novns> Gamah, and you have to know what objects are there, it's very limiting
[13:48:33] <Gamah> mrig: if anything's soul purpose is to test me in a programming IRC channel, that thing was doomed from inception
[13:48:50] <Gamah> novns: you can keep an array of pointers.
[13:48:53] <novns> Gamah, and you cannot send a message to an object in another running process
[13:49:03] <Raziel> I suppose with high enough reflection levels you could just dynamically grab all objects from everywhere? not sure if it'd be all that useful but
[13:49:06] <Gamah> novns: these are lanugage abstractions
[13:49:14] <mrig> wanting to change others could be considered quite an arrogant starting point, one that is going to mould and environment in what might not be the most peaceful manor.
[13:49:22] <Gamah> mrig: i don't want anything
[13:49:23] <Gamah> just hope
[13:49:24] <novns> Gamah, yes, and C++ lacks these abstractions
[13:49:38] <novns> that's why it's not so OOP as it looks
[13:49:57] <mrig> Gamah praying is the best way, directed with humility at something that is greater than ourselves.
[13:50:01] <Raziel> how OOP does C++ look?
[13:50:06] <Raziel> it definitely doesn't look as OOP as C# or Java
[13:50:19] <mrig> any other way has repercussions somehow.
[13:50:23] <Gamah> mrig: and such i thought it might be worth bringing up, expressing my prayer for the earth to have better humans on average
[13:50:31] <mrig> ah nice
[13:50:37] <Gamah> i sure know i'd feel shitty knowing i said something like that then finding out someone an hero'd over it
[13:50:44] <mrig> not going to argue with that!
[13:50:50] <novns> Raziel, in C++ you cannot interact with the whole world using messages, your program is your playground
[13:50:52] <Gamah> but i can't expect that everyone might have thought in the moment that such a comment might ahve those consequences
[13:50:57] <Gamah> that's why i don't generally make comments like that
[13:51:25] <Raziel> novns, so you want a meta programming language that also isn't constrained to concepts such as "processes" or, hell, kernel levels?
[13:51:26] <novns> Raziel, the more proper OOP exists in Objective C for example
[13:51:29] <Gamah> at least he eventually showed compassion, even if potentially a little too late
[13:51:32] <Gamah> it feels like growth
[13:51:37] <Gamah> that makes me happy enough
[13:51:50] <Gamah> rest assured this is IRC, we may never know
[13:51:55] <novns> Raziel, and in languages like Smalltalk

[13:52:35] <tomathy> i dont even have a problem if people wanna get drugged up their whole life
[13:52:37] <mrig> Oh this client is bad, going to have to write my own one.

[13:52:44] <Raziel> what rust drama?

[13:52:49] <bayaz> Title: r/rust - Moderation Team Resignation 
[13:52:51] <novns> C++ has just a subset of OOP
[13:52:56] <pyzozord> haha something ugly in me is devilishly happy about it
[13:53:02] <bud> https://github.com/rust-lang/team/pull/671
[13:53:04] <bayaz> Title: mod team resignation by BurntSushi · Pull Request #671 · rust-lang/team 
[13:53:30] <mrig> Gamah curious how language effects this medium or channel of communication.
[13:53:41] <bud> pyzozord: it's not ugly.
[13:53:42] <mrig> such and important aspect of it.
[13:54:12] <Gamah> mrig: agree, maybe the comment that struck me as malicious was an honest question
[13:54:22] <Raziel> Gamah, I suppose irc communities have rarely minced words, but most of the time the people don't actually have malicious intent
[13:54:32] <Raziel> sometimes the line is easy to cross unfortunately, and hard to read over text
[13:54:45] <Gamah> definitely
[13:54:51] <mrig> Gamah: Im sorry, context is king here, and I do not know to which comment it is that you are refering.
[13:55:27] <arahael> bud: Is that the *Rust* mod team, or the *reddit* rust mod team?
[13:55:34] <arahael> bud: I suspect it's just the reddit team.
[13:55:34] <Gamah> mrig: about one person asking another person if they were seeing monsters, and then another comment about the walls closing in from and to the same person.... and then the target person speaking of an hero, and the the initial person asking if they were okay and eventually saying they hope someone is ok
[13:55:37] <novns> nobody knows what has happened to Rust Core Resign Moderation Team, but there are 100500 theories
[13:55:50] <Gamah> arahael: i'm having a hard time figuring that out.... but it's on the rust-lang repo on github.... so
[13:55:55] <Raziel> I have a question: why/how does a *programming language* need moderators/community code of conducts/etc
[13:55:58] <Gamah> what does a "mod team" do on github?
[13:56:08] <novns> Raziel, there's no need
[13:56:13] <Raziel> I know rust built itself up by building a nice tight community, for the most part, but... it's hardly centralized, is it?
[13:56:14] <Gamah> Raziel: yeah i'm lost too
[13:56:45] <novns> Gamah, it's mod team of rust developers, their internal unneeded team that want to control everything
[13:56:59] <Gamah> without knowing the back story sounds like rust kept truding along... some people got in by probably helping with docs and disagreemnts by forming a "mod team" and it was appreciate
[13:57:12] <Gamah> then said mod team started probably getting in the way with pedantic arguments or issues
[13:57:19] <Gamah> and the rust team just kept trucking on ignoring them?
[13:57:22] <mobidrop> rust code of conduct looks woke anyway
[13:57:38] <Gamah> so now we have a ccommit in the history that does nothing except point out that some people who once contributed are upset about how they were treated?
[13:57:49] <novns> like "we cannot accept patches from white male developers until more female colored developers send their patches first"
[13:57:57] <Gamah> lol
[13:58:04] <novns> that's what mod team does
[13:58:04] <mrig> Rust seems rather complicated to me, not tried it yet though so cant really comment.
[13:58:07] <Raziel> novns, surely that's not an actual thing, is it
[13:58:25] <novns> Raziel, nobody knows what they do actually
[13:58:25] *** Joins: jinsun__ (~quassel@user/jinsun)
[13:58:33] <Gamah> Raziel: after the whole white/black master/slave master/main arguments in software, nothing surprises me anymore.
[13:58:33] <Raziel> well, not sure if that's much better
[13:58:52] <novns> it's not transparent, they just do this drama on public
[13:58:52] <mrig> some love the complexity other dont, languages for specific things seems to be more important than any particular style of language.
[13:59:16] <Raziel> Gamah, I fail to see why people fail to see that these things should be based on ability, merit, skill, etc
[13:59:23] <mobidrop> it's hard to shoehorn political gender / identity politics into programming anyway, because programmers care more about code than they do about people
[13:59:38] <Raziel> any irrelevant things attached to the persons doing the work should be kept irrelevant
[13:59:40] <Gamah> Raziel: because somehow equal opportunity has turned into an expectation of equal outcome in society
[14:00:05] <novns> it's just a war for control, that mod team wanted to control every aspect of Rust development
[14:00:18] <Gamah> it's really disappointing this resignation letter doesn't cite any specific references.
[14:00:23] <novns> and they were denied by the core team
[14:00:43] <pyzozord> what I am happy about is that this drama will affect rust reputation if only a tiny bit
[14:00:54] <Raziel> to an outsider that letter reads like "we're throwing a fit, but we're not really gonna say why because we expect everyone who's important will know why already!"
[14:00:56] <novns> the core team said "we will not play your games"
[14:01:05] <Gamah> Raziel: ++
[14:01:16] <pyzozord> i'm hoping that maybe few fanatics will relax a bit and the world will not be all rust in few years

[14:01:45] <pyzozord> readability is not one of them
[14:01:49] <novns> Rust is a nice language, but hard to learn
[14:01:50] <Raziel> pyzozord, trends like these come and go all the time. we should just take the good parts and implement them in C++ instead. :p
[14:02:00] <Gamah> pyzozord: have you seen python?
[14:02:13] <Gamah> imagine breaking an application with a wrongly placed whitespace....
[14:02:14] <mobidrop> Rust is one of the best languages around IMO
[14:02:22] <pyzozord> Raziel: 99% agree, just without the ++ :P
[14:02:25] <Raziel> the great monolith shall keep growing. and forever shall it be used and grown by those with the great knowledge of the dark arts.
[14:02:29] <Raziel> hah
[14:02:37] <mrig> some love the complexity other dont, languages for specific things seems to be more important than any particular style of language.
[14:02:46] <novns> Gamah, programming in Python is relaxing, and it makes you happier and less abusive person
[14:02:51] <mrig> never going to be all one language, that is for sure.

[14:03:04] <mrig> I like simple elegance.
[14:03:06] <Gamah> novns: until you want your code to actually get things done
[14:03:08] <Gamah> :P
[14:03:13] <Raziel> pyzozord, I'd be fine with the good parts being implemented in both C and C++, but additions/changes to C seem to be much slower than even C++ which already isn't known for evolving fast, so, I dunno what the prospects are
[14:03:15] <mrig> that is really complicated to teach though.

[14:03:44] <novns> Gamah, my code works, no problems yet (since python 2's unicode mess)
[14:03:48] <mrig> I dislike machinations, and find that rust seems to be a little afflicted by this some how.
[14:03:52] <pyzozord> Raziel: that's the world I'd like to live in, I can program in C, you can in C++ and we can interop and be happy
[14:03:59] <Gamah> we should just throw away all languages and write in native aseembler for our systems.... it's really the only real way to undderstand our systems anyway
[14:04:03] <mrig> difficult to put my finger on but it is off putting.
[14:04:07] <Raziel> yeah, that sounds good to me
[14:04:14] <Gamah> novns: the problems i tend to graviitate towards require throughput
[14:04:28] <bud> i don't know that much about how rust works, but it seems impossible to "implement" in C++. isn't its whole reason to exist C++ being too flexible?
[14:04:36] <mrig> I like go for its more direct approach to its opinions.
[14:04:46] <mrig> ... have respect for that.
[14:04:49] <Raziel> isn't rust literally implemented in C++?
[14:04:58] <Gamah> i think rust has been in rust for a while 
[14:05:01] <Gamah> since like 2016
[14:05:11] <pyzozord> go is cool, i recently decided that php is cool again too, (but less than python)
[14:05:18] <pyzozord> well php is maybe not cool, it's just ok
[14:05:29] <pyzozord> rust is cool, but it's also no ok :D

[14:05:36] *** aoei\Chickatrice is now known as Rust\Chickatrice
[14:05:36] <novns> bud, Rust is far more powerful than C++, but you have to learn all those FP concepts
[14:05:45] <mrig> I love those who opine and have rather a distaste of those who machinate.
[14:06:07] <bud> novns: more powerful? what does that mean?
[14:06:08] <Raziel> novns, are there actually things rust can do that C++ can't?
[14:06:30] <pyzozord> maybe he meant expressive
[14:06:32] <novns> bud, like you can extend the syntax of language to your needs
[14:06:33] <tomathy> more powerful === higher level
[14:06:37] <pyzozord> they are all the same turing-complete power
[14:06:37] <mrig> but that is just personal taste, character is born of things far deeper than the intellect and ego.
[14:06:40] <Raziel> and I don't mean having a build system and package manager :p

[14:07:30] <leduyquang753> Raziel It's a language feature, that doesn't make Rust able to do more than what C++ can do.
[14:07:32] <arahael> Raziel: Having the compiler implemented in a language that can be bootstrapped from C is generally a really good thing.
[14:07:35] <novns> it's Jinja-like templates that are native Rust code
[14:07:39] <arahael> Raziel: For various unfortunate historical reasons.
[14:07:40] <leduyquang753> Oops wrong mention.
[14:07:40] <pyzozord> the borrow checking itself is not necessiarly a bad concept, it might be actually quite cool
[14:07:43] <Gamah> Raziel: you also can't go out of bounds in rust in any way iirc
[14:08:08] <pyzozord> but that language just has so much more stuff on top of that that is just unecessary
[14:08:22] <pyzozord> and so complicated and hard to read
[14:08:25] <Raziel> Gamah, right, but the flip-side of that is that you have to stick any low-level code, like C interop, in unsafe blocks. and then you're just as fucked as before.
[14:08:26] <novns> bud, you cannot do this with c++, uless you write a special template recompiling tool

[15:15:18] <Gamah> long story short: electrons move slow, current moves fast.

[16:22:25] <mrig> Thats cool though, your founding philosophical belief is that of the atom.
[16:22:33] <Gamah> no
[16:22:43] <mrig> know that this is philosophy.
[16:22:47] <Gamah> see that's where your nuclear reaction argument fell really short
[16:23:00] <Gamah> we know about particles much much more fundamental than the atom
[16:23:02] <mrig> Well if you are looking for a foundational bit that is what an atom is by definition.
[16:23:22] <Gamah> an atom by definition is a collection of protons, nutrons, and electrons
[16:23:29] <Gamah> we've known this for almost a century now
[16:23:44] <mrig> I am going on the greek and sanskrit definition of an atom, both culture had cults that propounded this school of thought.
[16:23:52] <Gamah> thos are of course philosop[hically arguably arbitrary definitions, but they exhibit consistent behaviors, that's why we gave them names.

[16:24:17] <mrig> Gamah these are constructs of logos yes.
[16:24:18] <Gamah> that's why we can talk about subatomic "particles" as making up an atom

[16:26:00] <Gamah> not even close
[16:26:03] <mrig> in the schools of thought that believe in it.
[16:26:22] <Gamah> that hasn't been a current idealogy for something like 100 years
[16:26:29] <mrig> so you are arguing semantics and would like to monopolise language, I call upon the need of a better language.
[16:26:34] <Gamah> people in the 40's and 30's would have disagreed with you
[16:26:37] <Gamah> this is not about semantics
[16:26:47] <Guest47> Monotheism; a Jewish lie resulting in the decay of a race. Judeo-Christianity is the result of Monotheism.
[16:27:01] <mrig> this is kind of proving that the study of matter is not enough.
[16:27:40] <Gamah> mrig: do you agree most humans who care about understanding such a thing, belieeve that the electron exists?
[16:27:41] <novns> atom was a nice ide, but no one uses it today

[18:06:34] <[itchyjunk]> it's definately a felony
[18:06:42] <arahael> uni is state?

[18:06:55] <[itchyjunk]> some "hardware" are open to public
[18:07:02] <[itchyjunk]> like the library is "open to public"
[18:07:08] <[itchyjunk]> so they partner with state
[18:07:09] <wedr> Why not ask your university IT for a Linux laptop, because you need to do CUDA and Big Data analysis?
[18:07:13] <[itchyjunk]> so local citizen can some use it
[18:07:22] <Gamah> i'd just quit uni tbh
[18:07:23] <wedr> I'm sure university would have a Linux laptop somewhere
[18:07:35] <arahael> that said, the laptop isnt belonging to [itchyjunk], right? its reasonable to respect the owner's wishes
[18:07:36] <nomagno> itchyjunk: can you please answer my question? I am curious
[18:07:44] <Gamah> if they provide inadequate tools and forbid you to install adequate tools why go to said uni

[18:08:46] <wedr> [itchyjunk], If all you're doing to reinstall an OS (regardless of what circumstances you have) just to be able to join a meeting with your microphone off, it's not worth the hassle
[18:08:53] <[itchyjunk]> Gamah, 100 dollar laptop that can do everything i want? :D
[18:09:10] <Gamah> [itchyjunk]: i dunno, i'm just trying to help you not go to jail for participating in school i think

[18:16:23] <wedr> user51, What is a "stack machine"?
[18:16:32] <Gamah> if the laptop is state property isn't it illegal to use it not for approved reasons anyway? and wouldn't approved reasons be things that are legal for the uni to record, like class sessions?
[18:16:40] <merijn> wedr: Well, my point was mainly "it's so creepy it's illegal in the EU", which should imply "it's not entirely weird to be creeped out by that"
[18:16:55] <nomagno> itchyjunk: If the laptop has proctoring software installed, it is an active spying vector, and that's fine. Cover the camera, turn on the microphone manually every time it boots up, and only do uni activities with it
[18:17:11] <merijn> Gamah: Using it for personal reasons would be against the term of use, but not actually illegal
[18:17:24] <Gamah> merijn: apparently tampering with it was a felony
[18:17:32] <nomagno> Well its not necessarily fine. But you can deal with it.

[19:02:36] <apotheon> mrig: Anyone who actually learns something meaningful about philosophy should learn that one should always be open to new ideas, which helps with not getting grumpy just because someone has different context for beliefs, too.  On the other hand, it gets easier then to be grumpy about people essentially being self-contradictory and willfully blind to it.

[20:53:13] <servytor> hey I am a complete idiot, I am dealing with some software in a weird system. When you store a password, like 'password', you add a salt unique either to that user or static across the system (username, 'static123'). Then you take the hash of concatenating them or something md5('passwordstatic123'). is that basically correct?
[20:53:43] <servytor> and you store that hash in the database.

[21:09:35] <vdamewood> Are you generating a hash or validating a hash?
[21:09:59] <servytor> no, I am using internal functions of something called outsystems, I just linked to it above
[21:10:23] <vdamewood> servytor: Right, and there are two functions to generate, and one to validate. Which are you using?
[21:11:58] <servytor> I am just using their encrypting function to print out the salted hash, and it spits out a different hash each time given the same input
[21:12:12] <vdamewood> Yeah, that's the point to salting.
[21:12:23] <servytor> it's using GenerateSaltedSHA512Hash

[21:12:57] <pyzozord> how is it useful then?

[21:20:30] <vdamewood> pyzozord: The salt is useless for guessing the password.
[21:20:51] <jacekowski> yes, but you are bruteforcing each password individually, if you are after just one password it makes no difference, if you are looking for any password, static salt makes things a lot easier

[21:48:42] <peteyboy1> hm, alright, thanks
[21:48:44] <pyzozord> pyzozord: but in practice I'd use some library that handles that like react-query
[21:48:48] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: lol
[21:49:16] <peteyboy1> no idea what react query does
[21:49:25] <peteyboy1> i was thinking of handling it with redux toolkit's thunk
[21:50:02] <peteyboy1> pyzozord
[21:50:13] <pyzozord> there are also things like promise middlewares for redux
[21:50:24] <pyzozord> either a library or often also hand made
[21:50:58] <peteyboy1> i mean, there are many thing out there, but what's the benefit of one over the other?
[21:51:31] <pyzozord> a lot of it boils down to preferences
[21:51:38] <peteyboy1> react query seems pretty practical at first glance
[21:51:57] <pyzozord> it's kind of weird but it does the job
[21:52:58] <peteyboy1> so, could i like... store the "Example" component ( https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview ) in a util and reutilize it whenever i want to store in the global state something from different places around the app?

[22:26:30] <mathe8787> Hey everyone
[22:26:32] <mathe8787> I got an e-mail from a letter of rec and he sent me his letter for me to review and he will make the final decision of the changes (he did that just in case he forgot something). I am curious of anyone’s thoughts here about the letter. Would you add or remove something?
[22:26:36] <apotheon> "Hi.  Is there anything really critical you need done in the next two weeks?  What's that?  Oh, I'm just planning my two-weeks notice."
[22:26:38] <mathe8787> To the Members of the Graduate Admissions Committee,
[22:26:40] <mathe8787> I am writing in support of XXX and his desire to attend your PhD program. X has taken my two courses, X and Y, and earned top grades, presented a seminal paper in my XX Seminar at the XX, and I am his internal evaluator for his master’s thesis. 
[22:26:44] <mathe8787> X has shown very strong interest in the field of XXX. He has stellar grades in this specialization and has also dedicated his time to obtaining specific experimental skills. He specifically sought out positions in FPGA and software development to be well prepared on the software and hardware implementation of XXX. He has shown to be very proactive as he has reached out to many researchers in 
[22:26:49] <mathe8787> this field and he is currently doing his master’s thesis in X that focuses on this specialization. 
[22:26:51] <GeDaMo> Don't paste in the channel
[22:26:51] <mathe8787> It is rare in XXX(country) for students to have as much research experience as X has had during his bachelors and masters. His ability to simultaneously fulfill coursework obligations and work as a research assistant is quite impressive. He will come well prepared into your PhD program as he carries the specialized knowledge in XX and the experimental experience. I firmly believe that X is going 
[22:26:56] <mathe8787> to be a very capable and qualified PhD candidate and the lab that chooses him will substantially profit from his arsenal of technical skills. 
[22:26:59] <mathe8787> I thus recommend X without reservation for the admission into your doctoral program. I am sure you will find X to be a highly motivated, competent and committed student who will grow into a successful professional in this field. Please feel free to contact me if you require further information.
