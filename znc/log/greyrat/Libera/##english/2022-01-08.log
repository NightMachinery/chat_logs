[09:30:24] <pingpongball> `Sturgeon's law (or Sturgeon's revelation) is an adage stating "ninety percent of everything is crap." The adage was coined by Theodore Sturgeon, an American science fiction author and critic. The adage was inspired by Sturgeon's observation that while science fiction was often derided for its low quality by critics, the majority of examples of
[09:30:25] <pingpongball> works in other fields could equally be seen to be of low quality, and science fiction was thus no different in that regard from other art.`

[12:36:24] <furrykef> Perhaps because I've been calling such drinks "soda" since before I had the slightest idea what makes a soda a soda.

[14:00:50] <kurahaupo> samuely: you can't hear me if I only speak, I don't have a mic
[14:02:35] <kurahaupo> Yeah, while driving it's not a good plan to use a touch screen. Unlike an object with physical buttons with tactile feedback, a touch screen only works reliably while you're looking at it, rather than at the road in front of the car
[14:04:38] <pussipupu> It's also not good to talk on the phone while driving to be fair

[14:10:41] <kurahaupo> pussipupu: That is often quoted, but varies between people. (I tend to fall silent mid sentence when distracted by a moving object, so perhaps conversation is a less risk for me than for the population norm.)

[14:11:48] <pussipupu> I don't have papers to hand though
[14:12:53] <pussipupu> And it holds as a general point anyway
[14:13:36] <pussipupu> Conversations inside a car are less dangerous interestingly, because the other interlocutor naturally falls silent when they see an elk on the road
[14:13:58] <samuely> kurahaupo, i mean is my sentence correct?
[14:16:01] <samuely> every phone has a mic virtually
[14:16:10] <samuely> 99.9%
[14:17:03] <GuiToris> what does that 0.1% look like?
[14:19:07] <samuely> their mics are broken.
[14:20:31] <pussipupu> probably mostly like damaged phones, or interestingly modified ones
[14:20:45] <pussipupu> though you could have a phone that relies on external mic/speakers
[14:21:14] <samuely> please do not type. just speak. Listening is safer for him. (he's driving)
[14:21:24] <samuely> so the above is correct
[14:22:14] <pussipupu> "Please do not type; just speak. Listening is safer for him." (though "don't" would be more normal

[14:35:42] <samuely> yeah, I was speaking over the air.

[14:42:51] <samuely> so is it true some people will often use yup instead of yeah, or vice verse?
[14:43:04] <Me-me> Some may, indeed.

[16:09:05] <drogas> Hello, questions that had me in doubt: 1. is it half-mark e.g. "I lost half-mark on the exam" or "I lost half a mark on the exam" 2. is it "I was one of the top three in the whole of the US" or "I was one of the top three in the whole US"
[16:10:54] <furrykef> I'm not sure what "half a mark" (or "half-mark") is supposed to signify. I don't think this phrase is used in the US, or at least not where I went to school
[16:12:17] <drogas> well a mark on an exam for example
[16:13:18] <drogas> e.g. I lost a mark on that question, but got three marks in the next question. Is that not common?
[16:13:49] <drogas> basically my doubt rose from whether it should be half-mark or half a mark
[16:14:05] <Me-me> Both are valid.
[16:14:30] <Me-me> Same for the other one. I don't know the specifics.
[16:15:03] <Me-me> That is, "[...] in the whole of the US," and "[...] in the whole US," are both valid as well.
[16:15:34] <drogas> thanks me-me I understand how both can be valid which is why I guess the doubt came on me. Would love to get more in-depth understanding of it tho
[16:16:02] <Me-me> There is undoubtedly technical terms that specify why. I do not know them.
[16:16:11] <Me-me> s/is/are/
[16:16:11] <chat> Me-me meant to say: There are undoubtedly technical terms that specify why. I do not know them.
[16:24:48] <drogas> another question: is it in the first grade. or at the first grade it's another question of in/at
[16:24:57] <Me-me> "In".
[16:25:36] <drogas> so "They would start learning English in the first grade" is correct
[16:26:13] <Me-me> Yes.

[16:31:57] <panella32> Hi guys
[16:32:21] <drogas> merci me-me
[16:32:38] <panella32> I wonder what "I'm out of access to something" means. 
[16:32:56] <panella32> Curious to hear from native guys :)
[16:38:01] <kurahaupo> panella32: "to be out of something" means to have run out of it
[16:39:57] <panella32> kurahaupo thank you. so I can guess that "I'm out of access to my keys" means I don't have it with me and I don't access them" right?
[16:40:09] <kurahaupo> to "run out of access" is a slightly odd way of saying that access has expired
[16:40:47] <kurahaupo> or, they're run out of tokens that grant access, 
[16:40:59] <kurahaupo> they've99,99 runs out
[16:41:35] <kurahaupo> they've run99,99 out
[16:41:45] <panella32> I see.
[16:41:48] <kurahaupo> grr keyboard
[16:41:51] <panella32> Could "I'm out of access." somehow mean that I'm not available for a while? 
[16:42:30] <panella32> sounds odd? Or not same meaning at all?
[16:42:32] <kurahaupo> I would have to know "access to what" before I could narrow down the meaning
[16:43:19] <panella32> Okay great! Now I understand that what comes after access is not optional! Thanks for your great answer!

[16:46:54] <panella32> Do you have any slang in mind for "i'm not available for a while"?

[23:16:54] <mihael> The double-dash `--` is a comment indicator which will comment out the succeeding query after it. Is it right to use succeeding here? or is it more appropriate to use subsequent?
