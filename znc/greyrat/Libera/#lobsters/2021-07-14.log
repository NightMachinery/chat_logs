[04:56:07] <mpwoz> hi everyone! I've updated my firefox extension, Jumper, to support lobste.rs - it was originally borne out of a frustration with navigating HN's comments pages but I've extended it to support reddit and now lobste.rs. It's a super simple script that lets you navigate top-level (root) comments using your left and right arrow keys, nothing too fancy.
[04:56:07] <mpwoz> Hope someone finds it useful! https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jumper/

[05:02:17] <mpwoz> yeah, my last job used greasemonkey heavily for the same sort of thing - small optional tweaks on internal sites; it's probably faster than getting the owner team to add those features themselves :P
[05:03:14] <mpwoz> btw, I'd love an invite if anyone is willing; so far I've just been lurking the site anonymously

[05:05:31] <quanticle> What do people use these days, instead of GreaseMonkey, now that apparently GreaseMonkey is spyware or something?
[05:06:53] <quanticle> manicennui: I've been going into the office 3 days a week. I'm torn. I find it easier to concentrate in the office, and actually being on the corporate network, rather than being connected via VPN is nice as well. On the other hand, I really didn't miss my commute when COVID locked everything down.
[05:07:08] <quanticle> So far I've been going in 3 days a week and I think that's a nice balance.
[05:07:33] <manicennui> Yeah, I think the commute is the biggest downside, but I'm also listening to podcasts again.
[05:07:38] <lkhrs> quanticle: I remember TamperMonkey was popular a few years ago, not sure about now
[05:08:13] <quanticle> Haha, me too
[05:08:16] <mpwoz> lkhrs quanticle I think TM will have the same issue; doesn't it basically come down to trusting all the scripts you're running?
[05:08:38] <quanticle> mpwoz: I thought the GreaseMonkey extension itself had been bought by someone scummy.
[05:09:04] <quanticle> Kind of like Stylish.
[05:09:08] <mpwoz> oh I wasn't aware, yeah I think we used tampermonkey actually.

[05:09:32] <lkhrs> I think Stylus is the best Stylish alternative these days
[05:09:38] <quanticle> Yeah, I use Stylus.

[20:25:55] <dimdima> is kafka still good for resumes? i spent a lot of time with kafka streams. the whole stream-duality thing is really cool, and event sourcing conceptually really resonated with me. but it's not good tech for actually building applications

[22:30:07] <c355e3b> why is epoll giving me *back* the same fd I gave it?
[22:30:54] <gerikson> you don't deserve a new one
[22:31:06] <c355e3b> True
[22:32:06] <gerikson> "no FD for you!"

[22:36:00] <meff[m]> heh
[22:36:01] <epilys> c355e3b, been a while since I epolled but what func returns fds? you create an epoll, you register fds, and you epoll_wait which returns how many fds are ready
[22:36:22] <meff[m]> can epoll "change" the fds underneath you, or?
[22:36:27] <meff[m]> also been a long time since I used raw epoll
[22:36:30] <c355e3b> oh so I'm getting back the same fd because its readable?
[22:36:42] <c355e3b> (the man page doesn't seem to make this clear)
[22:36:45] <epilys> c355e3b, what function are you calling when you say epoll?
[22:36:49] <epilys> epoll_wait()?
[22:36:52] <c355e3b> yeah
[22:37:14] <epilys> it returns the **number** of file descriptors ready
[22:37:16] <epilys> the amount
[22:37:25] <meff[m]> ruh roh
[22:37:25] <epilys> not the file descriptors
[22:37:25] <c355e3b> right so I look in the array it has access to
[22:37:30] <c355e3b> then from there I'm pulling the fd
[22:39:08] <companion_cube> does it sort the array, epilys ?
[22:39:13] <epilys> no
[22:39:20] <companion_cube> so you still have to test them all? :/
[22:39:28] <epilys> you get the amount, and then you try each fd with a nonblocking read
[22:39:36] <epilys> and you should try up to amount times
[22:39:41] <c355e3b> oh boy
[22:39:47] <c355e3b> this interface seems kinda not good
[22:39:49] <companion_cube> seems perfectible
[22:40:17] <epilys> i think there's a better way but as i said it's been a while

[22:42:22] <demize> companion_cube: It only puts the fds that are ready in the buffer you gave it.
[22:43:20] <demize> So you don't have to test anything at all.  Just do whatever IO you were planning on doing with the ones that it told you are ready for IO.
[22:43:45] <epilys> ah yeah, you give it an events buffer
[22:44:19] <epilys> and it returns the amount because it might be less than MAX_EVENTS
[22:46:32] <companion_cube> ah ok!! cool.

[23:10:09] <simmel> dimdima: Get a deployment going, kubectl exec irssi -- tmux a, you're all done!
[23:11:08] <simmel> How do you keep connections alive and synced between pods? Like PF's pfsync(1) but for Kubernetes. This is the next big thing!
[23:11:24] <dimdima> haha i don't even know what that means
[23:11:40] <simmel> actually it's pfsync(4), my bad
[23:11:46] <ngoldbaum> lol scipy depended on itself for a release because they added a transitive dependency on networkx at the same time networkx added a scipy dependency
