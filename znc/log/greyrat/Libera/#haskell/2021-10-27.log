Streaming looks like it could give you a `Stream (Of (Stream (Of o))`, which is what's driving my intuitions about where I want conduit to go. The other option would be conduit's connect-and-resume `SealedConduit` stuff, but the library I'm using only accepts a conduit

The high-level goal: create a multipart upload in S3, and perform upload part requests such that each chunk is between some minimum and maximum size. amazonka can accept a conduit describing the body to upload. This makes me think about generating a stream of conduits, where each one streams from the outer conduit with minimal rechunking

For various reasons, it is impractical to use prepackaged versions, and I need it to be installed in /opt.  I've successfully bootstrapped ghc (using a prepackaged version on a temporary system to build it) along with Cabal libs, but could find no clear instructions,

[04:03:39] <geekosaur> https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/monad-transformers/ https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.71.596&rep=rep1&type=pdf
[04:04:04] <geekosaur> not sure they have one, they're more of an adaptation to haskell limitations I think
[04:04:13] <geekosaur> just as haskell monads are not full CT monads
[04:04:37] <op_4> geekosaur: ok, great, that's useful to know too. Thanks for the links!
[04:04:48] <jackdk> "endofunctors on the category of monads", perhaps? https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmorph-1.2.0/docs/Control-Monad-Morph.html

[04:05:02] <jackdk> I don't know CT well enough to say - I'm just banging words together
[04:05:33] <op_4> geekosaur: what do you mean they're not actually monads? Is this something like laws for unit and multiplication aren't actually enforced?

[04:06:07] <geekosaur> more like they're limited to the (pseudo)category Hask instead of all categories
[04:06:41] <geekosaur> that is, theyy are only defined in the not-quite-a-category of Haskell types
[04:08:31] <PuzzledSA> okay, I see what may be the issue here.  The webpage for ed25519 at https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ed25519 describes the ghc-prim dependency as >= 0.1 && < 0.7  but when I run the configure in ed25519-0.0.5.0 it says the dependency is >= 0.1 && <0.5
[04:08:45] <op_4> geekosaur: oh, sure. i don't know that this robs them of being monads in any meaningful way. Covariant powerset is a monoid only on set, but it's still a monad.
[04:09:14] <op_4> geekosaur: but you did say something completely new to me. What do you mean by pseudo-category?
[04:09:22] <geekosaur> Note: This package has metadata revisions in the cabal description newer than included in the tarball. To unpack the package including the revisions, use 'cabal get'.
[04:10:09] <geekosaur> I mean that Hask is commonly considered a category, but because of bottom it isn't one. There are extensions to categories that would admit it, but I don't know how much theoreticla work has gone into that
[04:10:43] <sclv> PuzzledSA: since you’re building everything by hand you can do that manually
[04:10:49] <sclv> The change
[04:10:49] <op_4> afaik, a pseudo-category is a weakened category object in a 2-category where composition is only associative and unital up to structured 2-cells
[04:10:52] <PuzzledSA> I am trying to *build* cabal in the first place...  can I just edit the "ed25519.cabal" file?
[04:10:55] <op_4> geekosaur: aha, i see, thanks!
[04:12:08] <geekosaur> PuzzledSA, yes, that's whyat a metadata revision is
[04:12:21] <PuzzledSA> It builds and seems to be fine.
[04:12:22] <geekosaur> so you should be able to simply change the upper bound to < 7
[04:13:44] <PuzzledSA> Already did and it works.  Thanks, broke the dependency logjam (at least for now!)

[04:22:21] <PuzzledSA> 4.17 on the webpage
[04:22:44] <geekosaur> metadata rev 4 bumped the base revision to >=4 and <4.17
[04:23:10] <PuzzledSA> so if I skip trying to build base and just bump tar dependency for base to 4.17 it looks good
[04:23:21] <geekosaur> metadata revisions do complicate doing things this way
[04:23:57] <geekosaur> but they greatly simplify hackage administration, when all that's needed is a rev bump in the cabal file and not a whole new upload
[04:24:21] <awpr> download the whole 00-index.tgz and extract the cabal files?

[04:25:15] <geekosaur> basically, if you're pulling stuff from hackage, look for the string "metadata revisions". it's a link. follow the link to see what package dependency revisions have been made
[04:25:17] <awpr> Hackage uses the, uh, _interesting_ technique of appending revised cabal files to the .tar, so the last one will overwrite all the others and will be the most recent

[12:11:29] <ski> not in general. in this particular case, yes, because you're picking `a' exactly once (and not depending on run-time input)

[12:12:25] *** Joins: echoSMILE (~echoSMILE@user/echosmile)
[12:12:25] <ski> this says that, for all types `a', `length' can be called with a list of `a's, and will produce an `Int' as result
[12:12:32] <ski> now, this is equivalent to
[12:12:42] <ski>   length :: (exists a. [a]) -> Int
[12:13:15] <ski> which says that, calling `length' will produce an `Int' as result, provided there exists some type `a' such that the argument is a list of `a's

[12:16:30] <zincy> So the normal length (no lang extensions) function can be thought of as 'exists'?
[12:17:49] <ski> you could think of the *argument* type as being wrapped in an `exists', sure
[12:18:37] <ski> `length' doesn't care about the element type. as long as there exists some element type such that the argument is a lost of such elements, `length' will work fine
[12:18:45] <zincy> *argument* type is (exists a. [a]) -> Int ?
[12:18:57] <zincy> I mean  (exists a. [a])
[12:19:05] <ski> no, `exists a. [a]' is the argument type there
[12:19:06] <ski> yea
[12:19:26] <ski> `forall' is what expresses polymorphism
[12:19:45] <ski> a polymorphic value is one whose type has a shape `forall a. ..a..'
[12:20:46] <zincy> I am confused about how in  `length :: forall a. ([a] -> Int)` [a] can be thought as (exists a [a]) 
[12:21:02] <ski> and it means it has type `..Int..',`..Bool..',`..[String,Bool -> IO ()]..', &c. .. for any possible (concrete) type that you can plug (consistently) for `a', it has that type
[12:21:12] <ski> no
[12:22:38] <ski> consider `\x -> x'. this has type `Int -> Int'. but it can also be given the type `Bool -> Bool', as well as the type `[(String,Bool -> IO ())] -> [(String,Bool -> IO ())]' .. in short, for all types `a', it has type `a -> a'
[12:22:55] <ski> and we express this by saying it has type `forall a. a -> a'
[12:23:39] <zincy> Right, the forall is saying that every parameterisation is treated the same
[12:23:45] <ski> now, a value of type `exists a. ..a..' doesn't have type `..a..' for *all* types `a' .. but rather, there exists *some* (unknown/forgotten/abstract/opque/skolem) type `a' such that it has type `..a..'
[12:23:56] <ski> take `[False,True,False]'
[12:23:58] <ski> we have

[12:27:57] <ski> in the sense that it gives us nothing new, no extra expressivity. because this is equivalent to `forall a. (... -> ..a..)'. and we already know how to interpret `forall's occuring just after the `::' in a type signature

[12:30:44] <ski> however, `... -> (exists a. ..a..)' *would* be a "serious" usage of `exists'

[19:21:00] <c_wraith> how is "freezes" distinct from "works correctly"?
[19:21:18] <c_wraith> It is supposed to block there
[19:21:40] <Guest73> shouldn't it report that it's running on {port} or something?  if I browse to localhost:8080 I get a blank page
[19:22:17] <c_wraith> a blank page or an error page?
[19:22:32] <c_wraith> because if there wasn't a server running on localhost at port 8080, you'd get an error page
[19:23:15] <Guest73> blank when i use firefox.  404 when i use chromium
[19:23:16] <c_wraith> that is, your browser would tell you it can't connect
[19:23:24] <c_wraith> 404 means there is a server running
[19:24:03] <c_wraith> not running would be "can't find the server at localhost:8080"
[19:24:24] <Guest73> ok, pebkac for sure

[22:31:10] <remexre> second question, what logging library do people recommend for an application that's mostly ResourceT (ReaderT r IO), so I'm only really logging in IO. Ideally it'd have structured logging (via Generic?), at least three log levels, and be configurable
[22:31:59] <monochrom> I think that something like tardis shows that S->(a,S) can be a monad in two ways. (And then tardis goes on to combine them into one monster monad.)
[22:32:44] <monochrom> OTOH I know a lengthy proof of why, e.g., "data P a = MkP a a" is a monad in a unique way.
[22:33:07] <monochrom> So, uniqueness happens for some types but not some others.
[22:33:11] <remexre> what's the way that isn't the normal state monad? for s->(a, s)?

[22:45:05] <zincy_> I believe a lot more of the *art* is logic/science than people realise
[22:45:11] <unit73e> some like adding features and making things pretty
[22:45:16] <zincy_> Thats what I am trying to get across
[22:45:18] <maerwald> zincy_: I don't understand that sentence
[22:45:57] <maerwald> unit73e: sounds like you *believe* in the unix principle. It has mostly been lost today.
[22:46:47] <maerwald> The latest addition to the anti-unix fleet has been nix. Now apparently, you can't do anything without it (like... installing GHCJS).

[22:47:07] <unit73e> maerwald, yeah I guess it's becoming rare but I see it resurecting often. One example, IDEs are being replaced with modular editors. Not perfect but better than nothing.
[22:47:29] <maerwald> well, I'm not sure how I feel about LSP
[22:47:43] <geekosaur> so they're reinventing emacs (probably poorly)?
[22:47:48] <unit73e> yup
[22:47:58] <unit73e> that's what vscode and friends are
[22:48:03] <unit73e> and atom
[22:48:21] <maerwald> I mean... now we have client-server architecture everywhere and my editor consumes large chunks of json that gets then dumped into my home folder and that I have to look at pretty often, because the server crashes or my client forgot what to do
[22:48:39] <unit73e> I use neovim but emacs is nice
[22:48:46] <geekosaur> atom I can surely say does so poorly; I waited a few versions for it to stabilize, installed it, ran it, leaving it open overnight nearly killed my system
