[02:33:26] <foo> Can someone help me understand what I'm missing here? I think that looks ok, maybe I cannot use @ like I think I can
[02:33:37] <foo> That's saying sed: -e expression #1, char 72: unknown option to `s'
[02:34:34] <Riviera> foo: there is one @ too many.
[02:36:23] <foo> Riviera: ohhhh, it's in my email. Facepalm.
[02:36:52] <Riviera> :)
[02:37:00] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)
[02:37:08] <foo> I think I can do sed 's@//Unattended-Upgrade::Mail "root";@Unattended-Upgrade::Mail "servers@mydomain.com";@g' /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades >  /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades ... or is this asking for trouble? :) 
[02:38:05] <foo> (assume I escaped the @ in my email properly :))
[02:38:15] <foo> I was more asking about > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades ... this does work fine if I escape properly
[02:42:48] <tirnanog> that would, indeed, be asking for trouble. see #13 at http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls.
[02:44:43] <Riviera> uhm
[02:45:09] <Riviera> foo: is this the same file?
[02:45:11] <foo> Riviera: yup
[02:45:14] <Riviera> dude
[02:45:16] <Riviera> :)
[02:45:21] <foo> Riviera: enlighten me. :) 
[02:45:25] <Riviera> don't let me compare character by character ;P
[02:45:32] <Riviera> next time use something like "foo" ;))
[02:45:41] <Riviera> and yes, see what tirnanog said.
[02:45:51] <Riviera> you know, the > is an operator by the shell,
[02:46:03] <Riviera> and the shell does the thing related to > before sed is even started
[02:46:04] <foo> Riviera: Now you know what it feels like... any idea how many people "use foo" ! I've been in therapy for years. That is the value of a foo'
[02:46:16] <foo> ah, didn't realize that
[02:46:38] <Riviera> normally, sed writes to stanard output
[02:46:44] <Riviera> the > just changes what standard output is

[02:47:09] <foo> ahh, ok, so I think - since I'm using sed - I want to add -i
[02:47:15] * foo checks man page
[02:47:29] <Riviera> it makes the shell open the file (for writing), truncate it (that's where it hurts), and then sed will start with stdout pointed to that file.
[02:47:33] <Riviera> sloppily speaking.
[02:47:57] <foo> Yup, -i worked. Rad.
[02:48:00] <foo> Thank ya'll
[02:48:03] <Riviera> you can use -i, yes, but different sed versions (e.g. GNU sed on Linux and the BSD sed variant on macOS) have different syntax for -i
[02:48:08] <Riviera> i'd just use a tempfile
[02:48:11] <Riviera> okies
[02:48:12] <Riviera> :)

[02:49:55] <foo> Riviera: ah, tempfiles would be more universal. This isn't too much scripting, I'm doing this on 4 machines haha and finding an excuse to learn
[02:50:07] <Riviera> okies, well,
[02:50:25] <Riviera> if it's like, something interactive that you're doing it's totally fine,
[02:50:43] <Riviera> i'd use tempfiles in scripts, because then i have more control over what happens -- in case something goes wrong
[02:50:59] <Riviera> alternatively check tools like ansible, they also allow for changing files, especially on multiple machines.
[02:51:15] <foo> nice, another friend was literally telling me about that 1 hour ago
[02:51:15] <foo> haha
[02:51:57] <Riviera> :))
