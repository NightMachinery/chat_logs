[15:59:14] <imp> DPA: thank you for your reply. Yes, it works.
[15:59:49] <imp> After your solution, and reading some CSS properties in MDN I came to this solution  https://jsfiddle.net/0erjkdu7/2/
[15:59:49] *** Quits: daoudr__ (~daoudr@91.90.122.16) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[16:00:16] <imp> seems the result is the same. What is the main differences? Advantages/disadvantages
[16:09:17] <DPA> With flexbox or grid, you need to know the parent element of the div / set properties on that, and it affects all child elements of it. But that can also be an advantage if you want to or place multiple elements in a certain way / layout, and felx also allows vertical centering.
[16:09:38] <DPA> *flex
[16:12:19] <DPA> Flex & grid are also much newer than display:block and margin properties, (that's a bad thing, as old browsers like IE8 won't support it, although but those browsers shouldn't be used anymore nowadays anyway).

[16:47:25] <imp> I think that I know, because div.container is being reduced to fit div.content.
[16:47:51] <hassoon> imp: div.content's white background is overlaying div.content's red background, which is in its turn, overlaying body's green background
[16:48:50] <imp> hassoon: yes. Also. Makes complete sense. Thanks.
