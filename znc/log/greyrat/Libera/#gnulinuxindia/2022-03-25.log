[20:48:48] <NeoVoid[m]> i think vimium or vimc can give you smooth scrolling
[20:52:08] <mxbl> netsurf is not chromium-based
[20:54:42] <Prit[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "> <@prit:matrix.org> Netsurf..." <- Thanks..Will try
[20:54:59] <Prit[m]> mxbl: Yeah its very lightweight
[21:36:08] <mxbl> there is visurf
[21:36:17] <mxbl> which is netsurf but with vi binds
[21:36:35] <mxbl> and the interface is less gtk-like
