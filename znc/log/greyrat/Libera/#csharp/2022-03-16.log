[00:07:20] <ki9a> They renamed from master to main, which caused my scripts to fail updating.
[00:11:23] <JakeSays> ki9a: lol you've been woke'd
[00:14:20] <JakeSays> Arokh: you need to invoke the conversion functions. it won't happen automatically
[00:15:22] <smitty> in playing with that code I had to change the signature of Cdto to make it work
[00:15:33] <Arokh> Sorry I should've mentioned that the expression needs to be ef core friendly, so I can't compile it.
[00:15:36] <smitty> to accept the Expressions instead of just the type
[00:16:43] <JakeSays> Arokh: new Cdto(AToDto(x.A), BToDto(x.B))
[00:18:32] <JakeSays> er,
[00:18:54] <JakeSays> that wont work

[02:14:48] <Nasp> It tries to precompute a graph of all routes and it does this rather excessively
[02:15:46] <Nasp> And in doing so it allocated 2.5 gb of memory
[02:20:05] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Maybe yours is due to the same reason :D
[02:21:08] <Suchiman> Nasp: ah, in my case the ApiDescription were not handling cycles very gracefully
[02:21:38] <Nasp> Cycles?
[02:23:37] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah XDocument got in there (because helper methods were marked public and instance on controllers which ASP.NET ignored as they didn't have [Route] nor [HttpMethod] but ASP.NET Core did include them. And then i was seeing things like Model.Data.PreviousNode.NextNode.Root.Document.FirstNode.PreviousNode. etc.
[02:23:53] <Nasp> For some reason out swagger is slow as well
[02:24:00] <Nasp> Not the endpoint getting the json, but the js part
[02:24:24] <Nasp> Anyways the route builder made 2 millioner allocated objects to precompute the graph...

[15:02:20] <smallville7123> aw ok
[15:02:43] <jonp> replace `object` with the type name, and then it depends on the type: if it's a struct, you get a shallow copy.  if it's a class/interface/delegate/etc., then they're the same instance.
[15:03:20] <smallville7123> so classes and such need to be explicitly copied?
[15:03:34] <Suchiman> yes

[15:06:23] <smallville7123> ok :)
[15:06:28] <ravindUwU> is anyone aware of any open source reference architectures/apps (preferably in C#) that support multi-tenant OIDC auth?
[15:06:39] <MatthiasVance> 27" monitor is too big
[15:06:42] <ravindUwU> For example, when making web app (SPA + API) where customers are businesses that have OAuth2/OIDC identity providers that they want to use. A specific Azure AD for users@client1.com, a specific Auth0 for users@client2.com, etc.?
[15:07:07] <smallville7123> is it possible to create an explicit copy of an object?
[15:07:17] <smallville7123> like, object itself
[15:07:25] <jonp> if you have access to the type
[15:07:41] <jonp> you can write your own "copy constructors" / "Clone" methods / etc.
[15:07:49] <jonp> System.Object has no state to speak of.
[15:08:07] <jonp> it *does* have a MemberwiseClone() method, which does a "shallow copy" of the instance state.
[15:08:08] <smallville7123> alright
[15:08:18] <jonp> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.memberwiseclone?view=net-6.0
[15:08:26] <jonp> which may be useful in writing copy constructors/clone methods/etc.
[15:08:44] <smallville7123> so for example, object is simply a IntPtr (or raw Pointer) so to speak?
[15:09:10] <smallville7123> eg object itself simply refers to some address in memoty
[15:09:26] <jonp> `object` is a keyword alias for `System.Object`, the root of the C# type system.
[15:09:33] <smallville7123> yea
[15:09:55] <jonp> it's not variable; it's not itself an address.
[15:10:02] <jonp> instances of object subclasses will have addresses.
[15:10:11] <smallville7123> yea
[15:10:25] <jonp> however, those addresses *will* change over time.
[15:10:46] <jonp> you can mentally think of "instances to reference types" "as if" they were pointers.
[15:11:02] <jonp> but at runtime that mental comparison only goes so far -- for like a statement, maybe. ;-)
[15:11:10] <jonp> because the GC can and will move objects around.
[15:11:12] <smallville7123> so when i do `object A = new(); object B = A;  A == B` what exactly is it comparing if A or B can change addresses over time?
[15:11:45] <jonp> when the GC moves an instance in memory, it updates all variables which refer to the instance.
[15:11:47] <ap5> Lol. I have managed, for a PR review of three lines, to have a comment for each three xD
[15:12:03] <jonp> smallville7123: so the GC would update both A and B to the recently moved location.
[15:12:14] <smallville7123> ok :)
[15:12:17] <jonp> `A == B` is conceptually a pointer comparison
[15:12:24] <smallville7123> :)
[15:13:11] <jonp> but if you assume you had the method: static IntPtr GetAddressOf(object instance);
[15:13:53] <jonp> then: object A = new(); IntPtr pA = GetAddressOf(A); /* do somethign… */ object B = A; IntPtr pB = GetAddressOf(B);
[15:14:01] <jonp> then A==B would be true, but pA == pB may *not* be true.
[15:14:27] <jonp> if we assume that during "do something" the GC moved the instance referred to by A to a different address
[15:14:39] <ki9a> you'll NEVER be able to reproduce that
[15:14:43] <ki9a> except if you depend on it
[15:14:51] <ki9a> it will break in production
[15:14:55] <smallville7123> so a System.Object is "equivilant (not the same but similar)" to a Pointer (maybe also with some additional underlying data) ?
[15:15:06] <ki9a> It is a pointer, the GC just knows where it is.
[15:15:14] <jonp> System.Object is a type.
[15:15:28] <jonp> *instances of System.Object* are conceptually like pointers.
[15:15:55] <jonp> List<int> is a type, not a pointer.
[15:16:04] <jonp> *instances of List<int>* are conceptually like pointers.
[15:16:08] <jonp> (List<T> is a reference type.)
[15:16:14] <ki9a> there's a trick; you can do *(void**)&local
[15:16:23] <ki9a> iirc.
[15:16:24] <jonp> in C#?
[15:16:30] <ki9a> haven't tried it recently
[15:16:37] <jonp> you can use GCHandle
[15:16:42] <BSaboia> Why constructors cannot have exceptions?
[15:16:47] <jonp> BSaboia: they can
[15:16:47] <ki9a> surely they can
[15:16:55] <BSaboia> Should not
[15:16:57] <smallville7123> and only the System.Object itself is copied by value ?
[15:17:03] <ki9a> no?
[15:17:06] <jonp> System.Object has no members
[15:17:13] <jonp> it has no instance data
[15:17:20] <smallville7123> System.Object instance *
[15:17:37] <jonp> can you rephrase?
[15:17:45] <BSaboia> ki9a: a colleague just said that Microsoft recommends against it
[15:18:10] <ki9a> Filestream does it
[15:18:13] <jonp> BSaboia: .NET Framework Design Guidelines is the bible for recommendations.
[15:18:19] <bomb> there is an unpopular C# clone started in 2006 called Vala
[15:18:22] <jonp> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/
[15:18:37] <jonp> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/constructor
[15:18:46] <jonp> > ✔️ DO throw exceptions from instance constructors, if appropriate.
[15:19:00] <jonp> "if appropriate" may be doing a lot of legwork there.
[15:19:07] <smallville7123> would A == B be equivilant to A.native_pointer = B.native_pointer; // with architecture-dependant integer type depending on address length)
[15:19:23] <jonp> conceptually
[15:19:43] <smallville7123> alright
[15:19:43] <jonp> again, with the provisio that the GC will move instances. A==B will work properly.
[15:19:47] <ki9a> Error	CS0208	Cannot take the address of, get the size of, or declare a pointer to a managed type ('M')	
[15:19:54] <ki9a> Looks like it doesn't allow it. Could have sworn it used to
[15:20:07] <ki9a> you can do this on the CIL level though
[15:20:08] <jonp> BSaboia: though: > ❌ DO NOT throw exceptions from static constructors.
[15:20:10] <smallville7123> A = B    *
[15:20:36] <BSaboia> jonp: yes, that phrasing may open another level of discussion. In this case, I was throwing from a class called Person if the name was null or empty
[15:20:46] <jonp> that sounds perfectly valid
[15:20:57] <smallville7123> would the same be true for a subclass?
[15:21:01] <BSaboia> To be 100% precise, from the private initialize method that it called
[15:21:10] <jonp> that sounds perfectly valid
[15:21:11] <jonp> :-)
[15:21:19] <jonp> smallville7123: i don't follow
[15:21:25] <BSaboia> Good. I thought so. Thanks!
[15:22:27] <smallville7123> eg X_class B = A; // B's base object references A's base object, but is B an exact reference to A such that all modifications are reflected in eachother?
[15:23:03] <jonp> that assignment is only valid if A is *declared* as `X_class` or a subclass of `X_class`
[15:23:15] <jonp> `object A = new(); X_class B = A; // error`
[15:23:21] <smallville7123> yea
[15:23:31] <smallville7123> assuming A and B are same type
[15:23:43] <jonp> do you know another language?
[15:23:53] <MaNa2k> whats normal to return in generic methods like this one if the input xObj is null and you wnat to return something that tells its null\0 or something else?         public static T MyGenericMethod<T>(this T xObj)
[15:23:53] <MaNa2k>  {   }
[15:24:28] <jonp> you have to return a T, so there's not any way to do that?
[15:24:52] <smallville7123> as if `B.native_pointer` is equal to `A.native_pointer` would that mean that `B` itself is equal to `A` ? for example, `A.i = 0; B.i = 5;` would `A.i == B.i;` be true or false
[15:25:16] <jonp> B & A would refer to the same instance.
[15:25:22] <MaNa2k> jonp, well that dosnt work, if(xObj == null) { return T; }
[15:25:26] <jonp> A.i==B.i is always true.
[15:25:49] <jonp> `T` is not "a T`
[15:26:02] <jonp> 42 is an int.  xObj is a T.
[15:26:09] <MaNa2k> jonp, only thing i was able to return is the same in xObj
[15:26:13] <jonp> `T` as a token is not an instance of a T
[15:26:13] <smallville7123> so in a class, anything declared in it would be contained INSIDE the structure that the native_pointer points to?
[15:26:35] <jonp> MaNa2k: if (xObj == null) return xObj;
[15:26:52] <MaNa2k> jonp, but that could lead to some strange stuff on the outside
[15:27:08] <MaNa2k> the caller might think it has recieved proper data
[15:27:08] <jonp> is that the responsibility of MyGenericMethod()?
[15:27:21] <jonp> throw an exception?
[15:27:33] <smallville7123> eg, `A.native_pointer` itself points to a structure with an integer variable, because it is an instance of a class that contains an integer variable, say `class X { public int i; }`  ?
[15:28:05] <MaNa2k> what kind? of exeptions ?
[15:28:08] <jonp> smallville7123: i think you might be "indexing" too much on `X.native_pointer`, and it's not actually a helpful concept
[15:28:12] <jonp> MaNa2k: ArgumentNullException()?
[15:28:16] <MaNa2k> NullReferenceException ?
[15:28:19] <MaNa2k> oh oki
[15:29:58] <jonp> smallville7123: if you had a C/C++ background I'd suggest "at the expression level -- maybe -- you can mentally replace type `X` with `X*` when X is a reference type, and be 'right enough'."
[15:30:09] <jonp> but i don't know your background, and that conception might be actively harmful
[15:30:35] <smallville7123> which in memory, would translate to struct GEN_X { int i; }; // native_pointer would point to an instance of `native_pointer = new GEN_X();` if it where translated to C/C++
[15:30:53] <smallville7123> which in memory, might translate *
[15:31:42] <jonp> C# `class X { int i;} … X x = new();` would be kinda/sorta C++ `struct X { int i; }; X* x = new X();`
[15:31:51] <smallville7123> yea

[16:16:20] <smallville7123> how can i reference a struct while still allowing for null
[16:17:46] <Suchiman> smallville7123: you don't "reference" a struct since structs are value types so they're stored inline
[16:18:03] <Suchiman> smallville7123: and `null` just means a reference / pointer to address zero
[16:18:08] <smallville7123> could i use Nullable<T>
[16:18:13] <Suchiman> smallville7123: obviously you cannot store an address into a storage location for a struct :P

[16:23:59] <Suchiman> smallville7123: important tidibit: if .Value is a property, having a getter, that is a method returning the struct so that makes copying unavoidable in that case (a field you could take a ref of like: `ref PointF v = ref outLocalPoint.ValueField;`)

[17:43:13] <Suchiman> Ownix: elastic pool is the same shiet (either DTU or vCore to allocate resources) but unlike Azure SQL Database, all databases in an elastic pool share the same resources (CPU, RAM, IO, Storage) and you only pay per pool, not database

[17:52:47] <Ownix> We have a private cloud, where departments can request a subscription to AWS, Azure, GCP and Platform Engineering creates their sub and grants them access
[17:52:58] <Ownix> and bills their department
[17:53:04] <jmer> Ownix: All this is assuming it's billed in the system they control... It's too easy to just get a company credit card and create a new "shadow" subscription that only your team/department knows about

[19:27:31] <ben> (my previous job was php and i still self-host a couple php webapps)

[20:21:52] <Nasp> Issue is the same though
[20:22:17] <jonp> i still don't grok the issue, as i haven't hit it yet
[20:22:18] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Yeah well would probably better to go to strongly types for some of this stuff but not exactly sure i know how
[20:22:41] <Nasp> jonp:  If i say .Single(x => x.Id == 1) on a collection, and there's two

[20:23:02] <jonp> …as it should?
[20:23:08] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Not sure i get your issue, don't you just need constraints?
[20:23:12] <Nasp> jonp:  Yes
[20:23:25] <Suchiman> Nasp: no, i'm overloading by query parameter names
[20:23:27] <jonp> that's why there's .Single() vs. .FirstOrDefault()?
[20:23:37] <Nasp> jonp:  Correct
[20:23:50] <Nasp> But imagine you called .Single on some build in .NET type
[20:23:53] <Nasp> That for now just returns 1 method
[20:24:00] <Nasp> Then another method is added in.NET 5 and 6
[20:24:04] <Nasp> And you just say .Single
[20:24:10] <jonp> then yeah, that'll break you
[20:24:20] <jonp> but *i* wouldn't consider that a "breaking change"
[20:24:27] <jonp> if i did, then you couldn't ever change anything, ever
[20:24:31] <Nasp> jonp:  No that's why i said when you use refleciton wrong
[20:24:44] <Suchiman> jonp: welcome to .NET Framework xD
[20:25:08] <jonp> .net framework changed.
[20:25:10] <jonp> occasionally.
[20:25:14] <Nasp> Because the .GetMethod actually has an overload that accepts a type array, so you can say "I want the method with this signature"

[20:53:10] <Nasp> Do you need anything special for that?
[20:53:17] <Nasp> I remember doing some data protection keys
[20:53:33] *** Quits: Babbage (~Babbage@94.11.27.96) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:54:09] <Suchiman> Nasp: MachineKey does not exist in .NET Core, nor does .NET Core know how to read the binary encoded bearer tokens once you've decrypted them
[20:54:36] <Suchiman> Nasp: microsoft only offers a solution the other way around, adding the .NET Core data protection to classic ASP.NET
[20:54:43] <Nasp> Ahh yeah
[20:54:52] <bomb> >  I’ve never worked with anything that made me want to quit software entirely more than React Native, and didn’t feel that way at all about Flutter. Maybe it’s just me but I feel like the developer experience of Flutter is much more consistent.
[20:54:53] <Nasp> But does that matter for you, wasn't yours a all in one go migration?
[20:54:55] <bomb> word.
[20:54:57] <Nasp> I need both to work
[20:55:10] <Suchiman> Nasp: no the account server / single sign on server remains on framework for now
[20:55:16] <Nasp> Ahh ok
[20:55:34] <Nasp> So Did you use DataProtectionProvider?
[20:55:41] <Suchiman> Nasp: and even if i were to migrate everything, tokens that have been issued into the wild must remain working
[20:55:54] <Nasp> Ohh we don't have any long lived tokens like that
[20:55:57] <Nasp> Only current user sessions
[20:56:06] <Suchiman> Nasp: no, i ripped all of machine key and data protection out of the reference source and made it work on .NET Core
[20:56:09] <Nasp> Ahh you are talking about oauth 3rd party
[20:56:10] <Nasp> Got it
[20:56:30] <Nasp> I had to make Framework trust sessions from .NET Core as well
[20:56:39] <Nasp> I think MS made a shim package to do just that
[20:56:44] <Suchiman> yeah
[20:56:55] <Nasp> But i can only get framework to trust .NET Core
[20:57:02] <Nasp> I mean opposite
[20:57:11] <Nasp> .NET Core trusts the tokens made by framework, but not the other way around
[20:57:30] <Nasp> So sessions are still created in framework, and it's a bit annoying
[20:57:32] <Suchiman> huh
[20:58:03] <Suchiman> *confused* having Core trust framework is the hard part (without modifying the framework project)
[20:58:53] <Nasp> https://gist.github.com/toftware/26fccde4c5dddf5ffa9caa0a8dacd2e8
[20:59:04] <Nasp> I modified framework
[20:59:20] <Nasp> But it's still anoying it doesn't trust it the other way around
[20:59:26] <Suchiman> Nasp: it works!!!! now... to identify all methods that are using overloading...
[20:59:31] <Nasp> Since we still have probably 6 months if not 2 years left before Framework is gone
[20:59:43] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Yeah i find it a bit annoying routes aren't validated on startup
[20:59:56] <Nasp> You just get the Ambigius match exceptions right?
[21:00:03] <Nasp> Would be nice with an exception just on startup
[21:00:17] <Suchiman> Nasp: ah yeah my solution works both ways :P .NET Core <-> Framework since i've thaught .NET Core to understand .NET Framework and .NET Framework understands .NET Framework
[21:01:07] <Suchiman> 18:29:58 <Nasp> You just get the Ambigius match exceptions right? <-- yeah
[21:01:24] <Nasp> But first when you call the controller
[21:01:39] <Nasp> Do you have two different formats then?
[21:01:45] <Nasp> We just have the one and both party can understand it
[21:01:51] <Suchiman> same
[21:02:00] <Nasp> But i'm not sure i get why framework doesn't trust the core tokens
[21:02:13] <Nasp> There must be some extra validation
[21:03:28] <Suchiman> Nasp: https://welp.dev/2022-03-16_18-33-16.png easy peasy xD
[21:05:21] <Nasp> We also have another issue with our claims
[21:05:42] <Nasp> They should be in the initial request, but the person who did that part had some issues, so he just issues a get request to the oauth provider first time to get the claims
[21:05:46] <Nasp> And to me that just seems soooo wrong
[21:07:01] <Suchiman> ah xD
[21:07:50] <Nasp> I think yours AspNetTicketSerializse is what we specify with "new AspNetTicketDataFormat()"
[21:09:30] <Nasp> Hmm looks like i might be missing a call to dataProtector provider
[21:09:36] <Nasp> Worst part is, it's a bitch to test
[21:12:28] <Suchiman> Nasp: ... i wonder if i decompiled this code, i can't find it on github lol
[21:13:10] <Nasp> I just say i'm missing a parameter that's optional
[21:13:19] <Nasp> That could be why it only works one way
[21:13:51] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah
[21:14:10] <Nasp> I kinda would prefer we had the auth as a separate login service
[21:14:46] * Suchiman does
[21:14:59] <Nasp> On a subdomain or?
[21:15:09] <Nasp> But yeah we didn't and it would have been so much easier
[21:15:18] *** Joins: alguien (~alguien@user/alguien)
[21:15:22] <Nasp> Especially because we have a "3rd" party login server
[21:15:35] <Nasp> Just change that in the Idp service, and make all services trust our own Idp
[21:17:08] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah, account.company.de and app.company.de using account.company.de which takes care of SSO for app and a few other things by now and also integrates with 3rd parties like active directory
[21:17:23] <Nasp> Nice
[21:18:01] <Nasp> We also have an old old old auth server we need to deprecated
[21:18:12] <Nasp> And it just takes forever when 3rd parties are involved
[21:19:24] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Do you redirect straight back after login?
[21:19:48] <Nasp> As in redirect to what the user requested to begin with
[21:20:19] <Suchiman> Nasp: authorization code flow so app.company.de -> account.company.de/OAuth/Authorize -> account.company.de/Account/Login?returnUrl=... -> OAuth/Authorize -> app.company.de/signin-company?accessCode=...
[21:20:50] <Nasp> I was thinking of making a "temp" landing page and then redirect after 2-5 seconds maybe
[21:21:05] <Suchiman> ah no
[21:21:10] <Nasp> And my reason for doing so is our application sometimes have some outages, and then the browser just keeps loading
[21:21:18] <Suchiman> the first time calling app.company.de you won't even see it, you just straight land at account
[21:21:21] <Nasp> And you don't get a proper response, the entire page is just white because it's a redirect
[21:21:37] <Nasp> So i experimented with returning a View and then doing meta refresh to redirect back
[21:23:07] <lz_> has anyone ever tried to scream "ok google cancel all meetings" in a crowded place?
[21:23:58] <Nasp> I have a feeling it will just say "I'm sorry, i did not understand that"
[21:24:17] <Nasp> My google assistant has some personality disorder, it talks to me in two languages
[21:24:40] <Nasp> Keeps insisting on farenheit, and when you ask it to change it, they actually bothered to program it to tell you how to go into settings to change it, instead of making it a command
[21:26:10] <lz_> probably a good things settings by default are readonly to the assistant :D

[21:30:31] <jonp> does not ring a bell
[21:32:19] <Nasp> But i do remember some doing physical attacks byt standing ourside peoples home yelling "ALEXA OPEN THE DOOR!"
[21:33:28] <Suchiman> ahhh... finding overloaded methods, nothing that a bit of reflection couldn't handle xD
[21:36:14] <Nasp> :D
[21:36:33] <Nasp> I kinda want to fix it so it isn't reflection
[21:36:43] <Nasp> Or goes from refleciton -> strongly typed
[21:36:59] <jonp> if you're a compiler, "all" is "reflection"
[21:37:08] <jonp> might not be System.Reflection per-se, but…
[21:37:19] <Suchiman> jonp: it's System.Reflection.Metadata
[21:37:29] <jonp> that's _a_ lib, certainly

[22:23:06] <bomb> actually 15 years for Google, and it's based on some Apache JVM by the programmers with previous mobile OS experience.
[22:23:36] <bomb> 15 years is 1968-1982

[23:45:23] <Suchiman> Nasp: it kinda worked? migrated some types automatically, others it did not (i guess my project was a little bit fucked), migrated the csproj, added some analyzers that tell me i should not reference System.Web namespace xD
[23:45:36] <Nasp> :D
[23:45:44] <Suchiman> Nasp: switched all controllers from Controller and ApiController to Controller and ControllerBase
[23:46:00] <Suchiman> added a HttpContext.Current workaround automatically

[23:49:27] <Suchiman> Nasp: lol my current strategy is that i'll prolly be done with the migration this week and then i'll commit it to a branch and setup a test system and then bother my manager to have it tested
[23:49:43] <Nasp> Sad
[23:50:14] <Suchiman> Nasp: this time around i went a lot more conservative than in my first migration, getting by with little code changes, mostly adding polyfills to make the old code work as-is
[23:50:38] <Nasp> This is controller by controller
[23:50:53] <Nasp> And due to the entire routing change from traditional to attribute it takes even longer imo
[23:52:56] <Suchiman> Nasp: first time around i went with going from [Route("bla")] to [HttpGet("bla")], making most things returning from T into ActionResult<T>, turning all the throw Request.Error(HttpStatusCode.NotFound, ...) stuff into return HttpErrors.NotFound(...); annotating every action with [ProducesResponseType(typeof(T), 200)], [ProducesResponseType(typeof(ErrorResponse), 400)], etc.
[23:53:38] <Suchiman> which made merging that branch with master a pain in the ass xD
[23:53:48] <Suchiman> or rebasing ontop of master to be precise

[23:54:29] <Nasp> I set a new password, copied it to a text file
[23:54:33] <Nasp> Paste it into the signin form and nope
[23:54:55] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Do you also have those throw and return
[23:55:01] <Nasp> No idea why people don't just return from controllers
[23:55:21] <Nasp> Why do you use ProducesResponse, isn't that what ActionResult is for?
[23:55:22] <Suchiman> Nasp: well in the web api days it was cool to just throw a HttpErrorResponseException
[23:55:27] <Nasp> Yeah i know
[23:55:35] <Nasp> I had to make a HttpErrorREsponseException for core :(
[23:55:46] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah that's what i went with this time
[23:56:11] <Nasp> It's a bit easier to keep certain shitty things during a migration
[23:56:21] <Nasp> Also some are throw in the web layer, but not in a controller directly
[23:56:23] <Suchiman> Nasp: ActionResult<T> allows you to either return T; or return NotFound(); but it does not tell swagger what status codes your method will ultimately possibly return nor which models those non 200 cases will return
[23:56:29] <Nasp> It's quite annoying and can't be great for performance
[23:56:39] <Nasp> "if (model == null) { throw exception }
[23:56:40] <Nasp> Whyyyy
[23:56:51] <Nasp> Suchiman: Well how many status codes do you need?
[23:57:00] <Nasp> Aren't most of your status codes the same all around
[23:57:12] <Nasp> But sure for not found it makes sense
[23:57:16] <Nasp> But not for 200 and 400?
[23:57:22] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah but also patching everything through as ActionResult's from the service into the controller is a pain xD
[23:57:51] <Nasp> What do you mean?
[23:58:20] <Suchiman> Nasp: well if you don't throw from like the web layer, how do you pass that error back to the controller and eventually the client?
[23:58:26] <Nasp> Also i kinda wished ActionResult implemented IAsyncResult
[23:58:39] <Nasp> Although not sure how great that would work
[23:58:49] <Nasp> We throw exceptions
[23:59:01] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah and if you were to stop doing that, how would that look like?
[23:59:11] <Nasp> return on every method?
[23:59:26] <Nasp> Error<TSuccess, bool> kinda like thing
[23:59:38] <Nasp> But i wouldn't stop throwing exceptions
[23:59:51] <Nasp> I would just validate what i can when i am in the web layer, but if it's in a service i just throw and let it bubble
[23:59:55] <Suchiman> Nasp: so you just go like if (!result.Success) return SomethingBadHappened();
