[00:47:54] <ThinkChad> but I got weird flickering issues
[00:47:58] <pjb> True.

[00:48:36] <ThinkChad> I could upload some screenshots on imgbb real quick to compare

[01:36:01] <Wolfe> You don't need a source block in a scratch buffer. Source blocks are an org thing.

[01:39:43] <Spawns_Carpeting> and I'm curious what themes people here use. My eyes cannot look at the green of the wombat theme any longer
[01:39:45] <Wolfe> Emacs even tells you that when you try and load a theme.

[01:41:08] <Spawns_Carpeting> so you must review the elisp before trusting a theme, which I figured you would have to do for anything you install anyways. Is there any good way to tell from a glance if it's doing anything it shouldn't be? Like accessing the disk or net

[02:32:33] <kakuhen> basically you set the number stupidly high so virtually no cpu time is spent on garbage collection during init
[02:33:19] <kakuhen> of course, init time doesn't matter if you run emacs in daemon mode, but I'm too lazy and dumb to set that up across my computers :s

[07:20:43] <pjb> atw: now, if you are programming in assembler, there are more tricks to be used.
[07:21:17] <pjb> atw: notice that a pointer to a cons cell, will have to be aligned on a pointer size (at least). This means that the 2 or 3 low order bits must be 0.
[07:21:59] <pjb> atw: You can generalize that to all the objects you allocate in a lisp system.  Say that all pointers are multiples of 8, so you always have 3 low order bits set to 0.
[07:22:12] <pjb> atw: then you can use them to store 3 tag bits.

[07:24:38] <twb> Oh you mean tag bits for dynamic typing?
[07:24:45] <pjb> yes.
[07:24:50] <atw> that's helpful, thanks! How can I know that in, say, x86_64, that aligned (aligned to what?) pointers have 3 low-order bits available?
[07:25:06] <twb> atw: I was about to say, tag bits are probably a bad idea on word-oriented architectures
[07:25:22] <pjb> atw: that's the definition of the notion of "alignment".
[07:25:48] <twb> atw: I would look at what modern CL implementations do
[07:25:59] <atw> aligned to the... word? is that the right term?
[07:26:01] <twb> atw: or for lofi, what does lua do
[07:26:07] <pjb> atw: objects of of size 2^n are aligned to addresses multiple of 2^n (for small n at least).
[07:26:58] *** Quits: zebrag (~chris@user/zebrag) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[07:27:09] <pjb> atw: the reason is because processors with word size > 1 may prevent access to words if the address is not a multiple of the word size (since we use byte addressable memories). Or at least, it will be slower, since it will involve at least 2 bus accesses.

[07:29:16] <pjb> atw: other reasons why addresses may be aligned to some even higher multiple, is memory management (malloc). When you allocate a block, there may be some overhead needed to manage the block (for example, we may need to record the size of the block, or a pointer to the next block, etc). So the memory manager may have a minimum size of block it can allocate (if you ask less, it will still allocate the minimum size), and all the memor
[07:29:16] <pjb> blocks will have addresses multiple of 2^n for some small n.
[07:29:46] <pjb> atw: note that there are other strategies for tagging data.
[07:30:32] *** Joins: johnjay (~pi@38.120.10.99)
[07:30:32] <pjb> atw: for example, instead of storing a type tag in each object, we could store all the objects of the same type on the same page, and store the type tag once for all at the beginning of the page.
[07:31:06] <pjb> atw: so all the conses would be in cons pages, all the fixnums would be in fixnum pages all the characters would be in character pages, etc.
[07:31:07] <twb> My gut feel is that tag bits are something you do on a PDP-11 not on an Raspberry Pi
[07:31:29] <edrx> pjb: done. how should I credit you in the code? "based on code by pjb from #emacs"?
[07:31:32] <pjb> atw: the advantage is that less memory is wasted on them, and the values can have the same range as in C…

[07:33:10] <pjb> atw: the inconvenient might be that there would be less locality for heterogeneous structures, but in lisp most objects are allocated on the heap and referenced with pointers anyways.  Only the objects that can be stored in the same space as a pointer and discriminated with the tag bits can be stored in the same place.

Similarly, most symbols have an empty plist, so it could also be stored elsewhere.  The home package of the symbol is the

[14:35:58] <irek> lucerne, greyrat: you can also use (interactive-p) function to test if something was run by user input.  So use hook like before and then add condition with (interactive-p)

[14:38:40] <irek> dale: hmm, I'm not sure
[14:38:46] <dale> I would expect any hook being called as part of buffer-list-update-hook to have (called-interactively-p) -> nil
[14:39:14] <lucerne> I am going the advice function route. Using that interactive-p seems likely to be trouble.
[14:39:15] <dale> Er, rather, (called-interactively-p 'any) -> nil
[14:39:50] <dale> greyrat: Maybe you want to test the value of this-command?
[14:40:02] <kakuhen> off-topic, but, damn the scope of down websites is much larger than i thought
[14:40:05] <lucerne> That could also work!
[14:40:14] <lucerne> kakuhen: ?
[14:40:23] <kakuhen> apparently CNN, stackoverflow, youtube, github, spotify, and a bunch of other websites are currently down
[14:40:38] <kakuhen> twitch is also down
[14:40:47] <wasamasa> lol
[14:40:58] <kakuhen> funnily enough i didnt notice 99% of these because I dont use them
[14:40:59] <wasamasa> less distractions
[14:41:01] <wasamasa> yes
[14:41:11] <lucerne> I hadn't noticed :))) They are indeed down
[14:41:15] <kakuhen> out of curiosity I decided to search "what cdn blew up this time"
[14:41:17] <wasamasa> the less you rely on these websites, the better
[14:41:24] <lucerne> btw, Dash has offline stackoverflow, it's pretty good
[14:41:25] <dale> greyrat: Of course, I can think of many ways to potentially "switch to a buffer", like what if you kill a buffer and now your IRC buffer is the active buffer, should that trigger your code?  What if you make a new frame displaying your IRC buffer?
[14:42:00] <dale> LaTeX becomes much less fun if tex.stackexchange.com is down.
[14:42:31] <lucerne> dale: I am content now with just advizing a few important functions. It was a best-effort thing.

[17:54:52] <edgar-rft> AltGr of course only makes sense with languages that share most of their alphabet with english characters, on greek, cyrillic or asian keyboards that use totally different characters AltGr wouldn't make much sense.

[22:31:56] <rgr> dap is the debugging protocol whichi gives access to third party debugging servers.
[22:32:12] <technomancy> imagine if you had like ... a weak sauce version of slime that could show you docstrings and do syntax highlighting but then needed a separate package to do eval and debug for some reason
[22:32:26] <technomancy> (and also you needed a separate server)

[22:32:36] <acdw> oof
[22:32:41] <technomancy> because they didn't think thru the requirements thoroughly enough when designing the first protocol
[22:32:42] <acdw> i'll just stick w/ lisp thanks :P
[22:32:45] <rgr> lsp is the language server protocol. And its for multiple servers/languages.
[22:33:00] <rgr> they weren't blessed with hindsight I guess.
