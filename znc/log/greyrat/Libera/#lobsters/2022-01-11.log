[19:57:00] <Zedronar> feoh: Yeah, that's what I said. Plus the development cost of migrating to Mongo. What document-based DB would you choose if you had to start from scratch? (and there was a _need_ for a NoSQL document-based DB to begin with)

[20:28:57] <arnt> At the time I did this, it was easy to not be ACID and miss. Even if the writers did things correctly (which wasn't the default), the readers could still miss, and did, by racing against the writer. Reads used a mongo slave by default, I don't remember whether that played a role. Anyway, this made me feel that Mongo is a poor choice even when it appears good at first glance.
[20:30:18] <maskd> multi-document transactions were only added a couple of years ago
[20:31:49] <arnt> Can Monto-today be configured such that you can do a write (against the master) and then read (from a slave) on the line below, and be sure to get the data written?
[20:32:04] <feoh> Zedronar: It would depend VERY heavily on my use case, right? So many options. Because I work for Amazon and kinda dwell mostly in the AWS universe my answer would likely be DynamoDB for work and maybe, I dunno CouchDB because it's easy for personal but I have VERY minimal scaling needs, so your needs WILL vary.
[20:32:23] <arnt> Just curious, I suppose.
[20:34:02] <Zedronar> feoh: Cool, I used to work at Amazon as well. What sub-org are you in? If it's ok to share.
[20:35:45] <Zedronar> And yeah I only had good experiences with DynamoDB. But haven't tried a lot of other document-based DBs. I forgot that multi-document transactions were added to Mongo recently. I still remember using it in ~2014 and worked really well. I guess it really depends on the use case.
[20:36:53] <arnt> Or the ability of others on the team to not feature-creep.
[20:38:30] <arnt> Because really, it was excellent for what my original colleague and I needed to do. We got the feature up and running, and could start invoicing. There is much to be said for getting to the stage where one writes invoices.

[22:19:40] <bmp> c355E3B: I can guess the answer, but are you able to go to C++20 by chance? I'm asking because the new auto template syntax, clang can leverage it to improve a lot of the template debugging situation, and it's strictly identical in terms of what it means.
[22:20:48] <ngoldbaum> will clang still spew megabytes of error messages if you have the temerity to use templates ever?
[22:21:08] <JordiGH> I think they've improved that.
[22:22:28] <companion_cube> aren't concepts supposed to be the solution to that?
[22:23:31] <bmp> Concepts required the syntax change I'm mentioning, but they're technically orthogonal.
[22:23:44] <bmp> clang improving error messages I *think* is also orthogonal? I'm not sure tho

[22:29:12] <bmp> It is, but it's relative.
