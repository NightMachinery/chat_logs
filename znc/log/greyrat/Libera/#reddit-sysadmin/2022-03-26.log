[11:16:40] <Kiernian|Work> powerful psychedelic highs...uff. no thanks. My existence is weird enough as it is.
[11:19:42] <yuken> Kiernian|Work, to call it a powerful psychedelic high is fucking laughable lol.
[11:19:51] <Kiernian|Work> oh, okay.
[11:19:55] <yuken> It's what your Grandma who thinks hemp flower with 0.2% THC is psychedelic.
[11:20:06] <yuken> It doesn't even compare to a mild hit of salvia Kiernian|Work, let alone anything serious :P

[14:58:28] <monr0e> If your vehicle happens to be sentient, then I would imagine there would be more complex questions to be considered around the subjects of citizenship, taxation, whether or not fuel in its case should be considered a foodstuff and thus exempt from fuel duty, whether or not that individual requires liability insurances as opposed to vehicle insurance, what ethics could impact scrappage, and similar.
[15:00:14] <yuken> I don't see why any of those NEED to change, monr0e.
[15:00:25] <yuken> Car requires gas and oil, human requires water and calories...
[15:00:27] <yuken> we can impound em both the same.
[15:00:59] <monr0e> Yes, but I'm from the UK. We're a little more civilised.

[15:02:19] <yuken> Oh, sounds hot. Keep going.
[15:03:00] <monr0e> Perhaps I can interest you in a debate on the particle physics in occurence when taking a blow-up sex doll on a spacewalk
[15:03:45] <monr0e> Or wax lyrical on the psychological ramifications of masturbation
[15:05:46] <yuken> monr0e, how do I be happy?
[15:06:24] <monr0e> You don't: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeCrnbJHJeY
[15:08:36] <yuken> monr0e, come on, now I'm crying!
[15:20:08] <fritzwastaken> I sear, even if I was making good money, I dont think I could lick a microphone that looks like a pair of ears for hours on end..
[15:20:34] <yuken> You would, fritzwastaken.
[15:20:52] <fritzwastaken> lol Twitch is a weird place on weekend nights
[15:21:00] <fritzwastaken> the asmr section is nothing but women licking mics
[15:21:49] <fritzwastaken> "ASMR FAST WET MOUTH SOUNDS" Quality titles
[15:21:59] <yuken> well fritzwastaken, once you start getting into keywords
[15:21:59] <monr0e> absolutely vile
[15:22:01] <yuken> it's all about efficiency! :P
[15:22:14] <yuken> I get the ASMR stuff, it happens to me with my right ear when listennig to music or whispers.
[15:22:15] <fritzwastaken> "Licking Ears | Relaxing | No Talking | "
[15:22:25] <fritzwastaken> "üî¥ Mind Melting Mouth Sounds ËÄ≥Ëàê"
[15:22:25] <yuken> When there is either separate audio in each ears, or audio going between ears.
[15:22:44] <fritzwastaken> Oh yea I get the actual feeling and human reaction
[15:22:49] <fritzwastaken> but its crazy how it turned into ear licking
[15:22:51] <monr0e> I don't
[15:22:53] <fritzwastaken> nothing but ear licking
[15:23:07] <fritzwastaken> I first realized it when I got a really good set of studio headphones
[15:23:11] <fritzwastaken> the big over the ear style
[15:23:21] <fritzwastaken> and Stereo audio seriously sounded good
[15:23:25] <fritzwastaken> not 2 channel mono
[15:23:42] <fritzwastaken> Movies and music can create the ASMR affect 
[15:23:55] <monr0e> I have some very nice sonys and a decent enough, albeit rather aged, amplifier. Stuff like that still disgusts me.
[15:23:59] <fritzwastaken> Especially when surround sound is done well
[15:24:13] <yuken> fritzwastaken, for me, it's very specifically the right ear (and jawline, neck - but still just the right side -  to an extent for physical sensations).
[15:24:15] <fritzwastaken> ASMR in general or the sexualization of it?
[15:24:22] <yuken> And only when the audio is focused in that one ear, or there is a... split audio.
[15:24:29] <monr0e> The weird "wet" sounds
[15:24:33] <monr0e> is revolting
[15:24:37] <yuken> like this song fritzwastaken, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdvnOH060Qg
[15:24:38] <fritzwastaken> yea, not a fan of the wet
[15:24:48] <yuken> Huge amounts of sound BETWEEN the ears which is what triggers it for me.
[15:24:54] <fritzwastaken> That falls into that over-sexualization of it in my book
[15:24:57] <monr0e> And frankly, asmr in general hold sno appeal to me
[15:25:05] <fritzwastaken> Theres tons of ASMR that is non-human and not... moist
[15:25:18] <yuken> monr0e, you've probably made used of it before, or had it done to you.
[15:25:35] <yuken> Unless you've never had a partner I guess.
[15:25:57] <monr0e> I bought these cans for blowing my brains out with good music. 
[15:26:05] <yuken> Haha.

[15:26:10] <yuken> :)
[15:26:17] <yuken> here's a song I'm listening to r/n, Animel Collective.
[15:26:20] <yuken> I love Animal Collective, Jesus.
[15:26:21] <monr0e> yuken: I can't stand noisy blowjobs, if thats what you're getting at. Instand softie.
[15:26:27] <yuken> haha, lolno monr0e 
[15:26:39] <yuken> just whispering in ears, kissing along their jaw, whatnot monr0e.
[15:26:53] <monr0e> Nope. Don't get near my face like that.
[15:26:57] <yuken> Damn.
[15:27:04] <yuken> You're missing out, but you do you :P
[15:27:38] <monr0e> It's likely a result of childhood abuse, so what I perceive as disturbing is likely warped in the eyes of the general public
[15:27:50] <yuken> ah. That makes it suck, then :(
[15:28:01] <monr0e> Also, autism
[15:29:39] <yuken> aaah, oof.
[15:29:50] <monr0e> I've never actually listened to any animal collective
[15:29:56] <yuken> You just keep adding on stuff. But, I mean... at least you've experienced enough to know you don't like it, haha.

[15:31:55] <yuken> linked another ANimal Collective, but also a Current 93 album. No hard feelings if you don't feel like listening ofc
[15:31:57] <yuken> it's long stuff lol
[15:32:21] <yuken> Current 93 still has that very trippy vibe monr0e, but it's a different feel from Animal Collective. Less upbeat, more... horrifying? I guess?
[15:32:34] <yuken> Religious undertones, death, youth & lost youth, and so on.
[15:34:34] <monr0e> Yeah, not my thing, I find religion rather disturbing. Another by-product of my youth. This is by far one of my favourite bands: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX_1DSbfg_A
[15:34:41] <yuken> ah.
[15:34:47] <yuken> Fair enough to you then.
[15:34:57] <monr0e> Well, I should say I find religion portrayed in certain lights disturbing
[15:35:10] <yuken> This started off in a way I thought I'd be able to suggest stuff for, but noped way off lol
[15:35:25] <monr0e> also disturbing isnt the right word either, but I can't english good today
[15:35:33] <yuken> monr0e, the way he talks about religion is more like...
[15:35:39] <yuken> "Do you believe in God?" type of question.
[15:36:16] <monr0e> Which is something I take umbrage with, because such a question is usually a loaded one
[15:36:23] <monr0e> but lets not, k?
[15:36:57] <yuken> Mmhmm.
[15:38:38] <Kiernian|Work> since I don't want to google it here, What in the nine hells is "ASMR"?
[15:39:05] <yuken> Kiernian|Work, it's not NSFW, it just can be used in NSFW contexts like a lot of other things. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASMR
[15:39:09] <monr0e> "Autonomous sensory meridian response"
[15:39:20] <yuken> Kiernian|Work, noises that make you feel relaxed or pleasured, basically. Usually focused in the head, can spread through the body depending on personal sensitivity.

[16:16:51] <yuken> I could spend a ton of effort on balancing it more, but so far, it doesn't seem much different to just gather all the base chemical needs, combine them together, and swallow.

[17:32:47] <Telgareith> so if maintence ever goes "WTF" I can be like "it's right there, and if you don't know how easy it is to rehang a door with two people you shouldn't be doing maintance
[17:33:11] <Telgareith> you can rehang a door with one person
[17:33:32] <Telgareith> just some clamps and putting it in the frame
[17:34:11] <Telgareith> but with 2 people it takes like 90seconds

[21:02:23] <lantech19446> there's an option for it in WDS but it won't do it for you unless DHCP is on the same server I'm having issues and one of the things I found said it needs to be authorized in DHCP to work right
[21:02:43] <mistiry> client does a broadcast discover. dhcp responds with an offer. PXE server responds with an offer. the negotiate from there.
[21:02:51] <mistiry> ah, windows...never did it on there
[21:03:14] <lantech19446> that seems to be how it works on windoze too but apparently there's some way to make it more explicit

[22:28:34] <JollyRgrs> as stated above, unless your DHCP server is also the WDS server, you have to pass it on (relay) to the WDS server to serve up the PXE boot. If you are working over multile subnets or vlans, you gotta do some stuff to make sure it traverses though, too
