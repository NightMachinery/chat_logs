[01:09:18] <arash> Hello, what do i need to know before start learning bootstrap? I know basics of css and html, is it enough?
[01:09:50] <teut> yes thats enough
[01:10:49] <teut> matsaman  sorry , I just noticed that I forgot that the code was in a previous commit
[01:11:24] <arash> any suggestion for me? some people said its wrong to start learning a framework before learning and practicing that language, its my concern.
[01:11:27] <teut> https://github.com/Teut2711/NirogGyanCompanyWebsite/commit/b4ab33f2200ba7c16d0f1ab7cfe9f0e75db8e2ea#diff-762d9845600f21eefd5d3871e75610fbc6d19207cbb317ef725c45be8f93e09c
[01:16:01] <matsaman> arash: you don't need to know anything before learning bootstrap, it won't help you with CSS or HTML
[01:19:23] <arash> matsaman, Isn't bootstrap about CSS? I mean doesn't it make problems in the long term if i start learning bootstrap without having enough knowledge about css?
[01:24:27] <matsaman> not really
[01:24:46] <matsaman> if you're expected to use bootstrap, it's unlikely you will be excepted to know how to use plain CSS
[01:24:50] <matsaman> and vice versa
[01:24:56] <matsaman> possible, but unlikely
[01:25:26] <matsaman> might've been different for a few months in 2011

[01:27:36] <teut> https://niroggyan.netlify.app/home  can someone help reduce the size of the svg?
[01:27:42] <teut> the big quotes
[01:27:45] <nbjoerg> huh? bootstrap doesn't replace html or css for regular formatting and structuring
[01:28:09] <teut> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/7d462529031792023f9c0c54fdc4b64a/image.png
[01:29:08] <teut>      <img src="..." alt='quote-open' width="20px/>   is not making the svg smaller
[01:29:10] <nbjoerg> teut: specify a size on the img tag
[01:29:28] <nbjoerg> width="20px" height="20px" ?
[01:29:56] <teut> ya I tried but it was a no-op
[01:29:57] <nbjoerg> oh, depending on the svg those get ignored
[01:30:04] <nbjoerg> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39056537/why-don-t-my-svg-images-scale-using-the-css-width-property
[01:30:05] <teut> means what?
[01:30:46] <teut> nice transform can be used
[01:30:50] <teut> thanks
[01:37:47] <teut> https://niroggyan.netlify.app/home
[01:37:59] <teut> now there is lot of empty space
[01:38:18] <teut> the svg image only shrinked
[01:45:11] <nbjoerg> yeah, because transform doesn't change the size
[01:45:17] <nbjoerg> try to do both
[01:45:59] <teut> doesnt change size?
[01:46:43] <teut>   width:"20px",
[01:46:43] <teut>         transform: "scale(.07)"
[01:46:44] <nbjoerg> might be easier to just fix the svg
[01:47:03] <teut> I just need quotes around the text
[01:47:16] <nbjoerg> why not just use normal tex?
[01:47:17] <nbjoerg> text
[01:47:37] <teut> for the quotes?
[01:47:43] <nbjoerg> https://unicode-table.com/en/sets/quotation-marks/
[01:47:44] <nbjoerg> yeah
[01:47:55] <teut> because quotes need to be big
[01:48:20] <nbjoerg> text-size :)

[01:51:19] <teut> the initial problem was this
[01:51:35] <teut> this is created using before and after elements
[01:52:03] <teut> https://niroggyan.netlify.app/home
[01:52:26] <teut> as you might be able to see the bigger end quote increases the  line height

[01:54:52] <teut> the designer gave this
[01:54:57] <nbjoerg> right
[01:55:23] <teut> now how to fix the end quotes is the big problem
[01:56:29] <nbjoerg> right float?
[01:56:45] <teut> i used floats long time ago
[01:56:50] <teut> but can try them
[01:56:50] <nbjoerg> using position relative would also be an option
[01:57:15] <nbjoerg> it's a bit of a hack in either case
[01:57:37] <nbjoerg> using a "table" like setup might also be an idea
[01:57:55] <nbjoerg> <left quote> <text> <right quote>
[01:58:10] <teut> yes that too failed
[02:00:01] <teut> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/ee56c8de9d1e0743b67f91e650934bbd/image.png
[02:00:10] <teut> this is float left and right
[02:01:02] <nbjoerg> btw, the choice of quotation marks in the designer's template doesn't logically make sense to me
[02:01:03] <hassoon> 'evening
[02:01:03] <matsaman> teut: h6:before, h6:after { line-height: 0; vertical-align: bottom; }
[02:01:09] <matsaman> stop using react, it's fucking dumb
[02:01:29] <hassoon> matsaman: what framework do you suggest ?
[02:01:34] <teut> vertical-algin  , didnt know about this propery
[02:01:55] <teut> react is not the problem, material ui is
[02:02:04] <hassoon> teut: use fiddles and real use case urls, not screenshots
[02:02:13] <nbjoerg> i.e. U+201C is the closing quote, not the opening quote
[02:02:40] <teut> hassoon you want a sandbox?
[02:02:52] <hassoon> teut: that will do fine
[02:03:08] <teut> ok then I can give that from next time
[02:04:39] <hassoon> nope, you start that by reproducing your current issue there

[02:06:23] <teut> that upper one is still going up
[02:06:45] <teut> well but now I can fix it I think
[02:07:22] <teut> thanks for all the good ideas , floats  , vertical-align ,  I  rarely used this stuff
[02:07:52] <teut> hasoon, well thats not possible for all things
[02:07:55] <matsaman> hassoon: for CSS? It's just not that complicated
[02:08:05] <teut> best is to just deploy the site and show
[02:08:10] <matsaman> the kind of person who feels the need to use bootstrap should probably use a WYSIWYG
[02:08:33] <teut> bootstrap has that?
[02:09:09] <teut> https://quilljs.com/
[02:10:10] <matsaman> teut: hrmm?
[02:10:28] <teut> isnt what a "what you see is what you get"?
[02:10:36] <teut> I used it with django once
[02:10:42] <nbjoerg> that's quite snobbish IMO
[02:10:58] <teut> and then only I got to know about the bizzare name of the email like text editor
[02:11:02] <matsaman> what you see is what you get, yes that's an example of that
[02:11:04] <nbjoerg> especially given that some people still have to support older browsers and that can be a pain in pure css
[02:11:25] <matsaman> it'll be a pain in bootstrap too then
[02:11:39] <teut> why kind of name is that for a text editor?
[02:11:50] <teut> what*
[02:11:51] <nbjoerg> bootstrap covers quite a bit of the interop
[02:12:17] <teut> just hand over quill.js to the,

[02:55:25] <lantech19446> I asked this in another channel but the PIC doesn't seem to be there is there any benefit to laying out flex first on a page? I played around with it yesterday, on its own it works perfectly but when I tried to incorporate it into my existing page it seems to be effected my non-existent css so I'm wondering if I should lay it out by itself and then add my other elements to it
[03:06:27] <hassoon> what's PIC ?
[03:06:42] <hassoon> ah person in charge
[03:07:22] <hassoon> lantech19446: what do you exactly want to do ? i don't get it
[03:07:35] <hassoon> flex is always good for making nice sorted layouts
[03:08:14] <lantech19446> it's just a general question I plan on learning css grid too which is reportedly better than flex but flex only seems to work right when it's the only thing on the page so should I be laying out my flex items and then doing the rest of the page?
[03:08:49] <hassoon> lantech19446: it's not better than flex
[03:08:59] <hassoon> lantech19446: it just has its own layout logic
[03:09:02] <hassoon> lantech19446: so is flex

[03:20:51] <lantech19446> hassoon: do you understand what i'm asking about flex?
[03:23:19] <theskillwithin> you should know both grid and flex
[03:24:04] <theskillwithin> philosophies around when you should use one or the other vary
[03:26:26] <lantech19446> but should I lay out my flex or grid items before I lay out the rest of the page? In other words does it work any better when it's done that way
[03:28:33] *** Joins: matsaman (~matsaman@user/matsaman)
[03:32:20] <theskillwithin> hmmm, im trying to think what I do,  im not sure.  I try not to over think it because then my ADD will take over, so I just methodically work from the top of the page/design to the bottom to prevent a sort of choice paralysis, and plus things are usually tweaked a little after you finish anyways
[03:32:45] <theskillwithin> top to bottom, left to right, outer to inner
[03:33:19] <theskillwithin> after a lot of practice youll naturally find your own flow
[03:39:40] <hassoon> lantech19446: do you ?
[03:40:21] <hassoon> lantech19446: your question is not clear
[03:40:28] <hassoon> lantech19446: just choose the layout you want to choose
[03:40:53] <lantech19446> I think my question was pretty simple, does flex work better if it's layed out before any other styling is done

[03:41:03] <hassoon> lantech19446: flex is one dimensional and grid is two-dimensional, that's the main difference
[03:41:34] <lantech19446> i'm asking specifically about flex though I'll learn grid eventually but right now i'm learning flex
[03:41:46] <matsaman> if you don't know what you're doing, it's better to do your HTML before you even touch CSS
[03:41:53] <matsaman> later you'll be able to do it simultaneously
[03:43:26] <lantech19446> My html is normally done first, i'm just curious about the order in which i apply css
[03:43:38] <hassoon> lantech19446: learn flex, use it, get and understanding of what it is and what it does by pratically building webpages using it, do the same for grid, then you can form a good understanding of both and get a better idea on which one to use
[03:44:16] <lantech19446> hassoon: I get that, my question has nothing to do with which one to choose
[03:44:38] <hassoon> lantech19446: nah it does, you'll come to the situation of choosing one of them
[03:44:47] <theskillwithin> if you literally mean the order. i like to put position and display at the top,  then box model stuff like margin and padding,  then font styling and color styling
[03:44:48] <hassoon> lantech19446: try these https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#css-flexbox and https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#css-grid
[03:44:51] <matsaman> lantech19446: yeah I would do _layout_ CSS before purely aesthetic CSS
[03:45:17] <lantech19446> ok that's exactly what i was asking, thank you
[03:45:26] <hassoon> what ??
[03:45:31] <hassoon> did i miss somehing ?
[03:45:36] <lantech19446> wait did fcc drop bootstrap now?
[03:45:44] <lantech19446> hassoon: i think you missed a lot
[03:46:06] <matsaman> free code camp?
[03:46:15] <hassoon> lantech19446: bootstrap is in the frontend libraries chapter
[03:46:22] <lantech19446> yea they used to teach bootstrap for responsive websites
[03:46:47] <hassoon> lantech19446: meh whatever you're up to, you do need to learn flexbox and grid, and then form a goof understand in which one you want to choose
[03:47:04] <lantech19446> I agree with you on that
[03:47:04] <hassoon> * a good *
[03:47:06] <hassoon> matsaman: yep
[03:47:54] <lantech19446> I was just curious if order of operations impacted the efficacy of them. because flex seems to be influenced by every little thing if it's applied after any other styling
[03:48:08] <matsaman> flexbox is genuinely useful, FWIW
[03:48:08] <hassoon> matsaman: just an online community offering free non-profit easy tasks/exercices for everyone to understand the topic in question according to a given chapter
[03:48:30] <matsaman> doubt I'll ever have a use for grid
[03:48:34] <theskillwithin> lantech19446 the order doesn't really matter aside from organization, if i understand u correctly
[03:48:37] <hassoon> lantech19446: i'm having a hard time understanding what you're up to or what you mean
[03:48:40] <matsaman> sounds like a great way to use CSS 100% backwards
[03:48:43] <hassoon> lantech19446: flexbox is nice, grid is nice
[03:48:45] <hassoon> both are nice
[03:48:46] <hassoon> meh
[03:49:02] <matsaman> I imagine grid is nice compared to, say, using bootstrap
[03:49:12] <hassoon> bootstrap is a joke
[03:49:17] <lantech19446> hassoon: I'm sorry man I just don't know how to ask it another way
[03:49:40] <matsaman> hassoon: and so is grid
[03:49:40] <hassoon> lantech19446: no problem, matsaman seems to have given you a satisfying answer form what i see
[03:49:50] <lantech19446> bootstrap is what I learned first but i failed miserably once i got to javascript and that was like 5yrs ago I had forgotten all of it
[03:50:07] <hassoon> matsaman: i like flexbox more, but..i would not claim that grid is a joke
[03:50:10] <matsaman> well, lucky for you bootstrap breaks backwards compatibility a lot =)

[03:53:44] <theskillwithin> i do a lot of react, and i find component libraries just get in the way, can just write your own components from scratch if you know css, and then you have full control
[03:53:49] <matsaman> if your ad mentions 'react' or 'agile' or 'scrum' or 'angular'
[03:53:53] <matsaman> boom, closed
[03:53:58] <hassoon> i've been using angular, but the broader job market now requires react wtf
[03:54:04] <hassoon> just started learning it recently
[03:54:06] <hassoon> what a pain
[03:54:10] <matsaman> well, even people who like react hate angular, apparently
[03:54:17] <matsaman> which is confusing, because react is shite
[03:54:23] <matsaman> so anybody using it obviously loves shite
[03:54:46] <lantech19446> what are these libraries supposed to bring to the table?
[03:55:09] <matsaman> Facebook handjobbing
[03:55:22] <matsaman> for some reason this idea never diminishes: that which is popular is good
[03:55:39] <hassoon> lantech19446: enhance/boost/speed-up/simplify scalable frontend projects
[03:55:40] <matsaman> which is obviously almost exactly the opposite of reality
[03:55:59] <matsaman> hassoon: is that what you think they bring, or what you think they think they bring? =P
[03:57:03] <hassoon> matsaman: i can tell than angular is nice and make my frontend development fun
[03:57:26] <hassoon> matsaman: but hey..i don't claim that it's better than the almighty powerful vanilla javascipt/css/html stack
[03:57:26] <matsaman> heh
[03:57:35] <matsaman> anything new, warranted or not, is fun
[03:57:39] <matsaman> that's the fundamental human flaw

[03:58:22] <lantech19446> hmm ok
[03:58:23] <matsaman> oh angular?
[03:58:28] <hassoon> matsaman: nah i'm talking about angular
[03:58:28] <matsaman> Google monies, right?
[03:58:38] <lantech19446> I should probably know vanilla js really well before trying to learn any of these then
[03:58:52] <hassoon> matsaman: it's good for scalable projects too
[03:59:04] <matsaman> scalable? =P
[03:59:09] <hassoon> matsaman: SPA apps as well
[03:59:15] <matsaman> would have to transition to server-side
[03:59:27] <hassoon> matsaman: you want to manipulate your SPA logic website-wide with vanilla javascript? meh
[03:59:28] <matsaman> don't need react for a SPA
[03:59:37] <matsaman> that's literally what react does
[03:59:40] <matsaman> but with a second language on top
[03:59:48] <matsaman> actually a couple more languages on top
[04:00:04] <hassoon> matsaman: ah dunno about react, i know that it uses ES6 javascript, but didn't work with it alot
[04:00:06] <matsaman> lantech19446: nah, you can learn whatever simultaneously
[04:00:16] <matsaman> lantech19446: it all just ends up being a comparison in your head
[04:00:20] <hassoon> matsaman: angular uses typescript
[04:00:29] <matsaman> well that sounds like even another language to me
[04:00:30] <hassoon> meh it's ES6 too mroe or less
[04:00:56] <hassoon> matsaman: many call it 'enhanced version of javascript'
[04:01:20] <lantech19446> i think right now i'm going to concentrate on getting much better with css and elements of design but it's really bumming me out how long it's going to take before i'm good enough to get a front end job
[04:01:27] <theskillwithin> when you get into doing larger projects, react helps a lot with organization by having components,  and manages state,  and gets rid a lot of spaghetti code because your tying ur functionality to your html(jsx).  also helps with css spegetti with things like css modules/styled components.  also react is very pure, its really just javascript at the end of the day
[04:01:28] <matsaman> hassoon: probably ordinary EEE
[04:01:43] <hassoon> eee ?
[04:01:56] <matsaman> tldr: everything popular is for people who can't store the slightest additional bit of info in their heads, and need a rigid paradigm or their code falls apart
[04:02:00] <matsaman> hassoon: embrace, extend...

[04:10:10] <lantech19446> I should find something I just don't know what
[04:10:26] <hassoon> lantech19446: we gave you clues
[04:10:53] <circuitbone> A simple game and a backend dashboard is an easy project. ( breakout in js and d3 backend )
[04:10:53] <hassoon> lantech19446: you can't have an idea if you haven't tried coding projects
[04:11:21] <hassoon> ya game development is nice as circuitbone said
[04:11:35] *** Joins: Gustavo6046 (~Gustavo60@user/gustavo6046)
[04:11:39] <circuitbone> breakout has a minor cost for coding, virtually zero art and allows you to capture data for charts and dashboards without the struggle of onboarding people.
[04:11:42] <theskillwithin> learning by doing is the best way
[04:11:50] <hassoon> yep
[04:12:28] <lantech19446> hassoon: I was responding to circuitbone's comment about a passion project

[04:13:36] <hassoon> lantech19446: any minimalistic game
[04:13:47] <hassoon> lantech19446: or pacman
[04:13:50] <circuitbone> breakout is chosen for a specific reason, you can then duplicate it to make space invaders and onwards
[04:13:55] <hassoon> oh god..i should make a pacman game
[04:13:56] <circuitbone> pacman is too heavy with A*
[04:13:57] <hassoon> ya
[04:14:11] <circuitbone> He will struggle with the path finding. save pacman for much later.
[04:14:38] <hassoon> circuitbone: dunno..the monsters should move randomly first, then you make them gradually chase the player with nice algorithms
[04:15:01] <circuitbone> hassoon:  I am a game developer for 30 years. educator for 20.
[04:15:09] <hassoon> lantech19446: that game too..does not require much logic https://ghanhass.github.io/simon-game
[04:15:22] <hassoon> lantech19446: the famous simon game
[04:15:23] <circuitbone> Pacman is further down the chain, it unpacks maze and pathfinding later.
[04:15:32] <circuitbone> Start with breakout.
[04:15:41] <hassoon> circuitbone: i see, good to meet
[04:15:52] <circuitbone> hello
[04:16:31] <hassoon> circuitbone: ah that's called breakout? nice
[04:16:37] <hassoon> i know it from many plateforms
[04:16:55] <circuitbone> breakout can make space invaders with some more functions
[04:17:03] <circuitbone> space invaders can lead to time pilot.
[04:17:09] <circuitbone> From there you have a slew of options.
[04:17:48] <hassoon> The Phaser Sandbox allows you to code games in your browser without having to download or install anything.
[04:17:51] <hassoon> oww nice
[04:18:51] <circuitbone> Once you have breakout, learn d3 or something that will formulate your back end dashboard statistics
[04:18:58] <hassoon> the code editor is the ace editor.. not bad
[04:19:42] <circuitbone> Use phaser to make the dashboard if you want it inside the game.
[04:20:05] <circuitbone> Total play time - total users players - enemies destroyed. time of play, country of play....
[04:20:53] <hassoon> interesting
[04:23:57] <circuitbone> https://elgoog.im/breakout/
[04:24:51] <circuitbone> Learn breakout and a lot of other games can be cloned quickly with a couple more methods and functions.
[04:27:26] <circuitbone> The reason why you make a game is to see how good you can attract and then onboard users for real data that you will manage and manipulate then analyse in a dashboard of your creation.
[04:28:52] <hassoon> you mean like scores/playtime/rankings ?

[04:38:37] <circuitbone> Managing multiple repos like that is more important than one larger game.
[04:38:46] <hassoon> ya 2d games are my interest
[04:38:52] <circuitbone> Ok
[04:38:57] <hassoon> nice
[04:39:18] <hassoon> not into messing with 3D i'd say
[04:39:50] <circuitbone> I am transitioning away from Autodesk to Blender at the moment.
[04:40:49] <hassoon> circuitbone: ah the free OS one
[04:41:27] <circuitbone> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/95phupKl/cgi_gamedev_costs.PNG
[04:41:34] <circuitbone> Expensive ignorance tax happens
[04:42:36] <hassoon> what's the trajectory cost ?
[04:42:41] <hassoon> it shows up big values
[04:43:07] <circuitbone> That is what you will pay over time with continued use of those products.
[04:44:55] <hassoon> ah wow
[04:44:57] <hassoon> FOSS ftw
[04:46:02] <circuitbone> That diagram does not include the addons - plugins costs either which can blow out.
[04:46:31] <hassoon> ah ya that too
[04:47:22] <nbjoerg> to be fair, if used in a commercial setting, it depends a lot on how well the product supports what you are doing
[04:47:36] <nbjoerg> but for hobby use, I find especially Adobe completely overpriced...
[04:48:54] <circuitbone> Ignorance tax happens
[04:49:38] <nbjoerg> also, there are a lot of good much cheaper alternatives now than e.g. 15 years ago
[04:51:19] <circuitbone> 15 years ago you could get by with and older copy of one of the flagship products. Truespace and others have been around for 20+ years.
[04:52:11] <circuitbone> I used Milkshape and Unwrap3d at one stage. ($70 US ) worth of software in a commercial setup.
[04:52:23] <hassoon> you can learn to crack/hack software too
[04:52:28] <circuitbone> Autodesk tokens anyone.
[04:52:33] <nbjoerg> let's keep things legal, please
[04:52:38] <hassoon> nbjoerg: meh
[04:52:43] <circuitbone> lol
[04:53:22] <circuitbone> Blender has 10x the developer base than autodesk at the moment.
[04:53:42] <hassoon> ya FOSS is more about community and supporters
[04:54:36] <nbjoerg> Blender has an insane budget
[04:55:02] <hassoon> nbjoerg: donations ftw
[04:55:50] <circuitbone> flex tokens and the current cost to use those legacy code bases are ignorance taxes
[04:55:52] <circuitbone> https://www.autodesk.com.au/benefits/flex
[04:58:08] <circuitbone> Mixamo and Substance are now plugins for Blender. You need a throwaway email if you don't care to give it to Adobe.

[09:05:44] <carlino3> hi
[09:05:53] <carlino3> is it safe to use customproperties? (variables)
[09:07:02] <oksushi> define “safe”
[09:07:09] <theskillwithin> do you need to support ie
[09:07:25] <oksushi> carlino3: https://caniuse.com/css-variables
[09:07:33] <carlino3> i have seen that ie is the only browser not uspporting it
[09:07:47] <carlino3> by safe i mean,it will work on almost all browsers
[09:09:03] <oksushi> 95.59% support according to CIU, so it would seem well-supported
[09:09:16] <oksushi> but, it’s going to depend on your website’s audience
[09:09:55] <oksushi> e.g. if they are in an area without newer tech, or the website topic would skew to older people who may not update devices as frequently
[09:09:58] <oksushi> etc etc
[09:11:17] <oksushi> CIU has a great feature where you can connect your GA account and pull in actual user data, then see what support is like for the actual users of your site
[09:11:19] <carlino3> if they use IE they don't deserve to visit my site
[09:19:21] <carlino3> hmm it looks like you cannot use more than one variable with calc(), is this true?
[09:23:42] <theskillwithin> huh?
[09:24:08] <theskillwithin> id be suprised if thats true
[09:24:18] <carlino3> calc(var(--some-foo) * var(--bar))
[09:24:50] <Rockwood> oksushi, what is GA account?
[09:24:59] <Rockwood> gmail account
[09:25:12] <carlino3> ok,nevermind. was my fault for not giving a default value to var()
[09:26:21] <theskillwithin> carlino3 depends on what the variables are
[09:27:03] <theskillwithin> carlino3 ie calc(10px * 10px)  makes no sense, even without variables
[09:27:31] <carlino3> why?
[09:27:38] <carlino3> =100px
[09:27:58] <theskillwithin> you can add them, and subract them,  but not multiply
[09:28:05] <theskillwithin> so thats where the confusion is prob
[09:28:18] <carlino3> yes,got it.
[09:28:55] <theskillwithin> for multiply its mor like calc(10px * 10)
[09:30:06] <theskillwithin> 10px * 10px is 100px squared, and that doesn't make sense
[09:30:38] <carlino3> yes, i understood. but it wasn't working for me because i didn't give a default value to var() and the variable was not defined
[09:30:50] <theskillwithin> ah

[14:57:53] <theskillwithin> important
[14:59:21] <theskillwithin> olle was that it? anymore questions?
[14:59:49] <olle> theskillwithin: Yes, could inline !important override !important from a CSS file?
[14:59:57] <thykka> yes
[15:00:14] <thykka> when there are multiple !importants, the usual specificity rules decide the winner
[15:00:27] <thykka> so inline+important is the worst case scenario
[15:01:34] <olle> What am I looking at here?? https://snipboard.io/f4Kc3b.jpg
[15:01:45] <olle> Calculated with = 150px, but looksl like 300px is applied
[15:01:53] <theskillwithin> thykka you mean best case
[15:02:18] <thykka> theskillwithin, definitely the worst case for everyone else, except the author
[15:02:36] <thykka> olle, it has max-width: 150px
[15:02:52] <thykka> so that should be the actual width, even if width property is set higher

[15:03:54] <olle> thanks, will check

[18:34:26] <thykka> yes
[18:34:30] <thykka> but you should not animate `top`
[18:34:36] <thykka> better to use transforms instead

[23:53:20] <teut> are you talking about optimization related stuff?
[23:58:00] <sybariten> not really ....  just a way to always have some standard style sheet available, i guess
