[00:19:35] <lalia> And there was a falling out on that server today evidently.
[00:19:59] <lalia> So we'll have to see if this group is even viable anymore, sadly.

[15:35:57] <dartmouthed> I will not trigger him any more. Or rindolf, or anyone for that matter
[15:37:43] <dartmouthed> So consider this a request to unban everyone who was banned yesterday because of my lack of foresight, please, (arryana? lalia? I don;t remember who was TheLaw)

[15:40:46] <arryana> from what i saw of that, if you're referring to yesterday, everyone who was banned was more than sufficiently warned that their behavior was out of order for the channel.
[15:41:09] <arryana> i have no idea how long the bans are for, but from where i sit, there's no reason they can't just take their punishment, which they earned, and wait it out.
[15:41:28] <arryana> but i'm no op, i have no dog in this fight.

[15:42:21] <dartmouthed> arryana, Mmmh. I'll ask lalia when she pops in. Thank you
[15:43:00] <arryana> i wouldn't expect much to change.  it's absolutely par for the course that shit-stirrers who get booted suddenly repent.  except they don't really, they just want to get back in.
[15:43:24] <arryana> and as i said, it wasn't new behavior for at least two of them
[15:44:52] <dartmouthed> I see
[15:45:20] <dartmouthed> badsektor's DMs were very in character
[15:45:36] <arryana> wheedling, demands, and whining?
[15:46:37] <dartmouthed> Mostly, yes. Except passive-aggressiveness instead of wheedling
[15:47:06] <arryana> you couldn't pay me enough to be an op

[15:48:01] <arryana> the fact that he went slithering to you to get you to beg on his behalf is just pathetic

[17:08:57] <mnemon> lots of people moved completely after the fn wipe.
[17:09:36] <rubiksdream> right
[17:11:49] <rubiksdream> is 'doing philosophy' = 'philosophizing'?
[17:12:06] <rubiksdream> i guess not, you could do philosophy without coming up with one
[17:13:43] <arryana> i don't think 'doing philosophy' is a valid english phrase
[17:14:07] <rubiksdream> whew
[17:14:11] <rubiksdream> im pretty sure it is
[17:14:19] <rubiksdream> why do you think its invalid
[17:14:35] * arryana shrugs
[17:14:42] <rubiksdream> or do you mean I need to prepend a proper noun to it
[17:14:44] <arryana> linguistically awkward, at best
[17:15:13] <rubiksdream> there's a book by timothy williamson called 'Doing Philosophy: From Common Curiosity to Logical Reasoning'
[17:15:16] <arryana> a person isn't doing eating.
[17:15:40] <rubiksdream> yeah, because eating is already a gerund
[17:15:45] <arryana> well, a publisher fell for it.  but i wouldn't have.
[17:15:50] <rubiksdream> you wouldn't have gerund gerund
[17:16:00] <rubiksdream> philosophy is a noun
[17:16:21] <arryana> now you're changing the purpose.  you said using the phrase 'doing philosophy' as equal to 'philosophizing'
[17:16:34] <arryana> and i'm running out of patience with this, as it seems to have no point
[17:17:12] <rubiksdream> ok
[17:17:29] <rubiksdream> it was a question, the point of a question is to discuss
[17:18:24] <arryana> at this point it feels like i'm talking to a four year old who is asking questions just to keep me talking.  'why is the sky blue, why is water wet, why, why, why'

[17:19:17] <rubiksdream> not really, the heart of the question was what does 'doing philosophy' broadly speaking, constitute of, philosophizing is theorizing on serious issues, is that what philosophy is?
[17:20:02] <rubiksdream> you could define 'doing mathematics' with less difficulty than 'doing philosophy', so I wanted to know what a 'philosopher' thought constituted 'doing philosophy'

[18:10:31] <l554> lalia: Curious if there were any previous or consensus views on this subject.
[18:10:35] <arryana> some explosion somwhere right off the tube line
[18:10:37] <Inline> fire ?
[18:10:38] <lalia> The porpose of the research is ostensibly to provide grounds for developed detailed psychiatric study related to the change in mental states following regular use of psychedelics.
[18:10:39] <Inline> oO
[18:10:55] <arryana> just started hitting the news here

[18:11:32] <Inline> oh man so many accidents as of this decate, it's like accumulating/getting more frequent
[18:11:38] <lalia> Looks like sensible work, but I'm guessing it's mainly to justify additional research into irregular psychological conditions and treatment options.

[18:12:58] <Inline> not sure if the weather is behind it
[18:13:03] <Inline> humidity and stuff
[18:13:07] <arryana> someone will go to jail for that
[18:13:30] <lalia> l554: Looks like the conclusion for the paper is fairly in-line with the popular consensus in western medicine from what I can tell. The reason the paper would be novel is because it provides what is being held as conclusive evidence confirming this popularly held intuition.
[18:13:42] <Inline> if it were a static failure in it's construction it wouldn't have hold that long either
[18:15:15] <lalia> arryana: how's the day going? I've only been up very briefly. :)

[18:16:08] <Inline> haha
[18:16:35] <l554> lalia: Ah. OK. Thank you.
[18:16:45] <arryana> to be honest, i'm surprised, given the prognosis
[18:17:10] <lalia> :3

[18:17:23] <spruit11> there's no way you can make that study stick

[18:18:28] <arryana> or if your downstairs neighbor is gone part of the day
[18:18:47] <lalia> spruit11: It would require more support from other published research, hence my claim that the aim of the paper is likely to justify developing further studies.
[18:25:09] <lalia> Word, I'm gonna make coffee and start reading this recent Lagerlund text on the history of skepticism in philosophy. Real new book from a scholar I'm not at all familiar with.
[18:25:14] <lalia> Should be interesting. :)
[18:25:27] <arryana> oooh
[18:25:30] <spruit11> it's hardly double blind and they pre-selected an audience likely with a biased aptitude.  you're never going to make that stick anywhere.  I guess I know what they're getting at but I doubt it works that way
[18:25:47] <arryana> walking the virgin snow of new material.  awesome.
[18:26:24] <lalia> Should be edifying, at least for the breadth of perspective. This author's background is mostly medeival scholarship.
[18:26:34] <lalia> Sounds like an interesting perspective to bring to the table.

[19:03:22] <arryana> i had an older hawaiian friend who said a thing i thought was profound
[19:03:34] <Parf> raincomplex, science, imho, has begun to outstrip man's capacity for developing ideologies to stand upon them.
[19:03:54] <arryana> 'you always know the tourists from people who travel.  people who travel look around them and learn, tourists take their own world with them and live in its bubble'
[19:04:58] <spruit11> yah,  that's true.  too many people fly over two continents just to sit their fat asses next to a pool.  never sure what that is about
[19:05:01] <spruit11> but ah well
[19:05:06] <Parf> humankind can hardly even properly contextualize the science as it develops, without a significant (sometimes multi-generational) preparation that even serves to specialize the individual to such an extent that they can't even share the information they've developed themselves to comprehend
[19:05:22] <Parf> as if they need to trade the ability to discuss with the ability to comprehend. you can't have both
[19:06:04] <Parf> trying to shoehorn modern science into any ideology is pretty laughable, and i look forward to the day when we accept that we none of us have any fucking clue what's going on
[19:06:28] <Parf> not that i think we shouldn't try
[19:06:42] <spruit11> more sciences but a lot of scientists would actually agree with that
[19:06:58] <raincomplex> yes it definitely seems to me that there is a tradeoff between the process of learning and the process of communication
[19:07:03] <Parf> i would say they do, yeah. most are so skeptical they suspend belief entirely, as a rule
[19:07:42] <raincomplex> i think there is subtlety in being effectively skeptical
[19:08:12] <Parf> sometimes, though, without some sort of narrative to bind the science, it's hard to even rationalize pursuing any new fields within that science, trying to get funding, for example, for something totally innocuous, might be extremely difficult
[19:09:04] <spruit11> sure,  sales is a major driver of science.  as well as getting students ethusiast about stuff
[19:09:06] <Parf> if anything, the 'story' is more important than ever. soon as we lose capacity for storytelling, for fantasy, the worse off we'll become. the fewer gaps that hold our imaginations, the smaller they will shrink
[19:09:27] <raincomplex> the subtlety of skepticism is directly related to what i mean by 'applying science to ideologies'
[19:09:49] <Parf> it's not even necessary to imagine much these days, most of it's done for you by some cgi algo, or youtube's search prompts, plenty just skim along, waiting for entertainment 'service'

[19:11:05] <Parf> i think the ability to condense these lofty concepts and to squeeze them down into comprehensible stories is an underrated task, and it is no wonder that there isn't a general, collective narrative that can help guide us into the future

[19:11:41] <Parf> yes! i think there's even a limit to the space our cognition can inhabit, wholesale, raincomplex
[19:11:56] *** Joins: Crassus (~Crassus@user/crassus)
[19:12:06] <Parf> as if we're all tuned to FM, and it's a limited frame for the entire human race to "think on"
[19:12:21] <raincomplex> i accept that in theory but i wonder if we're really maxing that out right now
[19:12:28] <raincomplex> well
[19:12:39] <Parf> my guess? the entire bandwidth fluctuates
[19:12:41] <spruit11> we're more degrading or minimizing that at the moment
[19:13:03] <raincomplex> and there's two dimensions to it, right. there's capacity and there's "ability to capture aspects of reality"
[19:13:09] <raincomplex> i was refering to capacity

[19:13:22] <spruit11> the whole Internet now consists of cheap thoughtless takes people can easily agree with
[19:13:28] <Parf> right, capacity alone, it's a wonder we can make any progress at all, considering how blind we are
[19:13:29] <raincomplex> i think in the latter it's an open question as to how much of reality we can theoretically understand
[19:14:53] <Parf> the tools we have are so refined that they completely obliterate our attempts to comprehend them, but with these tools the total bandwidth of human notion expands in kind. with fewer eyes and minds working with these concepts, these vantages, the bandwidth contracts. it's an observer/reality relationship in that sense, a sort of oscillation that depends on each to do its part
[19:15:21] <Parf> so, the answer is to get more minds interested in science so that future generations can reap the benefits of our current discoveries
[19:15:37] <raincomplex> i think it starts to become a question of specialization, right
[19:15:43] <spruit11> doing better science is a great start!
[19:15:54] <spruit11> or not
[19:15:54] <raincomplex> in order to transcend the bandwidth limitations of each individual, we specialize
[19:16:01] <raincomplex> but this requires good communication and trust
[19:16:08] <Parf> asimov talked about foundation and empire, the goal of the first civilization should be entirely driven to "building a civilization that will destroy itself in such a way as to become a foundation for the future civilization that inherits it"
[19:16:27] <spruit11> Hegelian
[19:16:49] <raincomplex> re "a general, collective narrative that can help guide us into the future" my current feeling on this is that we need to fold religion and science together
[19:17:05] <spruit11> that's what Putin thinks
[19:17:13] <raincomplex> guilt by association fallacy
[19:17:52] <Parf> i do not believe a "god of logic" is what we need

[19:18:25] <Parf> the fruition of science is the capture of that which is "indistinguishable from magic"
[19:18:54] <spruit11> too mystic
[19:19:06] <raincomplex> i mean religion in the sense of an intuitive, wisdom-based understanding of the world. science is very rational
[19:19:13] <Parf> i think there is use in god, in religion, in belief, but i don't think it can be built up from what is not known to be of divine origin
[19:19:14] <raincomplex> we need to unify rational and intuitive thinking
[19:19:25] <raincomplex> both are valuable in their own ways
[19:19:26] <Parf> that's my point, there is no god of logic

[19:20:08] <spruit11> analytical philosophy comes to mind
[19:20:22] <Parf> raincomplex, i mean the 'thing' humankind appears to be building, a pantheistic conglomeration of philosophies and spirituality, and scientific views
[19:20:42] <Parf> that, to me, is the god of logic. not an actual god, but some human simulacrum of that, some view of what it "should be"

[19:37:22] <Parf> the other day i had a pretty good question, i thought. sometimes, convergent groups of individuals can appear to be moving in concert, but not individually choosing to do so. this is often seen in prey, and prey can often resemble a sort of predator en masse. now. say the resemblance is complete, does the prey then become equivalent to the predator it once only resembled?
[19:38:49] <spruit11> uh,  a herd of gnus can kill a lion?
[19:38:50] <Parf> namely, can the convergent behavior itself become self aware through its individual parts
[19:39:03] <Parf> yes, but they don't eat the lion
[19:39:31] <spruit11> good for the soil though
[19:39:42] <spruit11> no idea
[19:39:46] <Parf> so, feeding their kids, then?
[19:39:57] <Parf> "we kill the lion, then we fertilize the soil, then we eat the grass"
[19:40:09] <spruit11> right,  the circle of life
[19:40:58] <Parf> in any case, cut out the animals, and start using concepts, or even consciousnesses
[19:40:58] <arryana> you lost me early in your leaps of supposition
[19:41:05] <spruit11> or as Zizek once put that proposition: "we gas the jew,  that feeds the crop,  we eat the crops.  it's all a circle of life thing"
[19:41:31] <arryana> still doesn't make sense from where i sit

[19:42:01] <arryana> you're not often particularly coherent
[19:42:28] <Parf> to you
[19:42:32] <arryana> why would an accidental grouping of prey turn them into predators?
[19:42:40] <Parf> not accidental
[19:42:59] <arryana> you're claiming some motivation?
[19:43:29] <Parf> well, obviously herd motives exist in examples in nature
[19:44:22] <spruit11> most of this stuff usually boils down to definitions
