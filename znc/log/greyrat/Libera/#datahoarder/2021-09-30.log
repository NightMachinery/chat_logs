[18:24:01] <skye0_mobile> they think covid-19 is a biological weapon created by the state to keep people under control when really what's more likely the case is a zoonotic virus no thanks to humanity's further invasion of nature
[18:24:17] <cirdan> damn
[18:24:44] <skye0_mobile> even if it were lab created, world leaders who have had it wouldn't want to take any chances on dying from it or whatever
[18:25:05] <ThePendulum> maybe these people just aren't evil enough
[18:25:06] <cirdan> my brother things the vaccine is just some experiment cause it takes 15 years to make one
[18:25:27] <cirdan> ignoring that it *has* been in development for 15-20 years cause of MERS/SARS/etc
[18:25:34] <skye0_mobile> my problem with the vaccines is just the whole capitalist patent and IP law bullshit around it. i'd rather it were as open source as like what openinsulin.org are doing

[18:25:39] <ThePendulum> they didn't spend their childhood contemplating how to acquire world domination or eliminate everyone, so they don't realize this is ont it
[18:25:42] <ThePendulum> *not
[18:25:48] <cirdan> and my dad things the vaccine is just as dangerous as the virus... sigh.
[18:25:50] <skye0_mobile> the real problem with healthcare is the damn profiteering and america driving pretty much that attitude
[18:26:34] <ThePendulum> I think the vaccine can be a lot more dangerous than the virus
[18:26:40] <ThePendulum> but you have to throw it hard enough
[18:27:17] <cirdan> yeah it's only more dangerous if you stab someone in the eye with the needle
[18:27:24] <cirdan> and even then maybe not
[18:27:39] <skye0_mobile> also a lot of anti-lockdown and anti-vax people reek of privilege
[18:27:57] <joepie91> "it takes 15 years to make one" isn't really accurate anyway
[18:28:14] <ThePendulum> I do fear we're a long way away from any government providing enough incentive to develop a vaccine this quickly
[18:28:29] <skye0_mobile> i just got a flu jab by the NHS. my parents have the flu, they just have to wait it out and get the jab a bit later. meanwhile there are countries worldwide that can't get like insulin because of the damn profiteering, shitty infrastructure of developing countries and severe political corruption
[18:28:40] <joepie91> it doesn't take into account whether something needs a revolutionary new approach vs. whether it's based on something existing, it doesn't take into account all the regulatory delays which understandably can suddenly go away when literally the entire world has "making the vaccine happen" at the top of its priority list
[18:28:54] <ThePendulum> I wonder why flu jabs seem to be more common in the US and UK than in the Netherlands, afaik it's more of an old people thing here
[18:29:05] <cirdan> just like the space race joepie91 
[18:29:12] <joepie91> yeah basically
[18:29:18] <skye0_mobile> ThePendulum since I'm technically part of the NHS they started giving them out to staff
[18:29:22] <joepie91> if everybody involved in the process wants it enough, it will go much much faster
[18:29:23] <cirdan> throw a ton of money at science and see what happens!
[18:29:26] <skye0_mobile> and booster shots too for COVID-19
[18:29:28] <ThePendulum> joepie91: the regulatory delays going away is not very comforting, lol
[18:29:46] <joepie91> so much of the slowdowns in projects have nothing to do with the actual work and everything with navigating bureaucracy
[18:29:48] <skye0_mobile> i think a lot of people are jaded by scientific institutions, seeing them as too leftist and greedy
[18:29:51] <cirdan> ThePendulum: with what? the covid vaccine?
[18:30:00] <joepie91> ThePendulum: I disagree; note how I said "regulatory delays" and not "regulations"
[18:30:05] <joepie91> the delays are bureaucratic in nature
[18:30:07] <ThePendulum> right
[18:30:10] <cirdan> skye0_mobile: yeah ever since they said tobacco was bad
[18:30:13] <skye0_mobile> greed is no thanks to publishers working with scientific institutions and pharmaceutical companies
[18:30:22] <joepie91> I'm not talking about the actual regulatory work going away, but that work only takes up a very small part of the typical medical approval process
[18:30:30] <joepie91> much of it is navigating bureaucracy
[18:30:38] <skye0_mobile> cirdan big tobacco has downplayed the climate crisis as well as the effects of smoking, fuck them
[18:30:39] <cirdan> and sitting in someone's INBOX
[18:30:42] <joepie91> and everybody very suddenly had a strong interest in making that bureaucracy not be there :p
[18:30:53] <joepie91> yeah
[18:31:04] <skye0_mobile> big tobacco are about as bad as big oil
[18:31:48] <ThePendulum> what stake does big tobacco have in the climate crisis? surely people aren't /literally/ smoking like a chimney?
[18:32:17] <skye0_mobile> idk but like a lot of american businesses and individuals even if they foresee the climate crisis they don't give a shit about it
[18:32:39] <ThePendulum> they blame each other
[18:32:40] <skye0_mobile> "the free market will sort it out" or "God will sort it out" or "God's wrath be upon homosexuality and abortion in the form of extreme weather"
[18:33:18] <cirdan> my brother sadly puts way too much stock into the conspiricies like "oil companies have a carberatur that will get you 50-100mpg locked away"
[18:33:24] <cirdan> or "free energy from *"
[18:33:50] <skye0_mobile> speaking of medication i might be offered local mental health services and they may offer me anti-depressants, i just don't want to become dependent on them. one time i took anti-depressants, i had almost debilitating insomnia
[18:34:10] <ThePendulum> I'd think if they did this would probably be the right time for them to talk about it and boast about their climate improvements...
[18:34:12] <cirdan> there's a ton of different ones, you sadly need to try them all and see what works
[18:34:19] <skye0_mobile> cirdan yeah, free energy is physically impossible, unless you're using the sun, but even in several billion years it'll go out
[18:34:40] <cirdan> no you can siphon it from high voltage lines via induction
[18:34:50] <cirdan> but then the elec co will sue your ass for theft of service
[18:35:05] <cirdan> it's been done, the guy lost bigtime
[18:35:25] <cirdan> companies with money get laws passed to make it very expensive to not pay them
[18:35:35] <cirdan> like stealing a shopping cart is $$$$
[18:35:40] <skye0_mobile> fuck corporate greed
[18:35:50] <cirdan> sharing utilities is illegal too
[18:35:57] <skye0_mobile> cirdan initially just saw local health services for insomnia, was told by the doctor i had anxiety (also on a questionnaire that i got depression) and she signposted me to local health services.
[18:36:20] <ThePendulum> that is just free energy in the sense that tapping it from the neighbours is free energy
[18:36:27] <ThePendulum> induction is still a load
[18:36:30] <cirdan> cause utilities charge a per-customer fee
[18:36:42] <skye0_mobile> a lot of modern free market economics i believe matured at a time when the environment was of very little concern, i.e. during the industrial revolution or way longer before
[18:37:03] <cirdan> sure
[18:37:08] <cirdan> or the 1950s
[18:37:18] <cirdan> *cough* dupont
[18:38:13] <skye0_mobile> i think there's been very little change in how money works besides the fact we can now just manage it all digitally

[20:37:38] <ullbeking> I'm planning a large and quiet NAS for multimedia at home.  Chassis will be Fractal Design Define 7 XL.  Trying to choose board and CPU's.  Repurpose X10DRi-T with dual E5-2500v2?  Or buy new X11SSH-F (or TF) and repurpose E3-v6?  On the fly transcoding by CPU is required.  Very quiet operation essential.
