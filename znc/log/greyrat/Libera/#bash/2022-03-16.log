[06:18:52] <greycat> You don't dot in a variable.  You dot in a file (a script, basically) full of shell comamnds.  You do that instead of RUNNING the script like a normal program.
[06:19:27] <magyar> ahh, got it
[06:19:29] <greycat> Or, instead of having the command as a file to be dotted in, you create it as a function, and then you run the function in your interactive shell.

[06:26:49] <greycat> now that's VERY different.
[06:26:55] <OnlineCop> I just want to make sure it's not [[ (A || B) && C ]]
[06:27:13] <greycat> those are expression operators within the mini-language of [[, not short-circuit shell operators between two commands
[06:27:28] <OnlineCop> Sorry for the short-hand.

[06:27:46] <OnlineCop> if [[ $is_colored -eq 2 || $is_colored -eq 1 && -t 1 ]]; then ... fi
[06:28:13] <greycat> Personally, I would avoid the ambiguity by splitting up the [[ into two parts, nested/indented appropriately.
[06:28:22] <OnlineCop> If a user specifies "--color=always" (is_colored=2) or if a user specifies "--color=auto && is_terminal" ...
[06:29:02] <OnlineCop> (is_colored=1, is_terminal=`-t 1`)
[06:29:02] <larryv> within [[ ... ]], && has higher precedence than ||

[06:30:31] <greycat> actually, that 1) part needs to be changd a bit, so it sets go=0 if it's not a tty... or else initialze go=0 before the case
[06:31:38] <OnlineCop> I could do that. I was hoping to avoid yet-another if/case statement, but if it's unavoidable...
[06:31:46] <greycat> but if you're absolutely in love with the HOLY GRAIL OF STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING (long-ass if conditions that span 17 lines so that there is only one place the full set of conditions can be satisfied) then do it your way
[06:32:23] <OnlineCop> The above actually WAS the whittled-down result of a 17-line-spanned checks. :D
[06:32:32] <greycat> another way I would strongly consider writing it is
[06:32:33] <greycat> go=0
[06:32:47] <greycat> ((is_colored == 2)) && go=1
[06:32:55] <greycat> ((is_colored == 1)) && [[ -t 1 ]] && go=1

[06:49:13] <OnlineCop> Does `declare -p` return an array, or just newline-separated strings?

[06:50:52] <OnlineCop> `set` would work the same, I take it?
[06:51:09] <OnlineCop> Is there something that would show the variables/functions/etc. that those produce, but as an array?
[06:51:28] <greycat> if you intend to use the output in any kind of program, set is NOT safe for that purpose, and neither is env

[12:10:57] <Earnest> I will never understand this need
[12:11:34] <Earnest> If you love 'echo' as a four letter string so much why not make your own function?  echo() { printf '%s\n' "$*"; }
[12:12:53] <Masklin__Gurder> Hey that's not a bad idea
[12:13:18] <ormaaj> Hahahaha
[12:13:19] <Masklin__Gurder> Also, the "need" is just that if the string to print is very simple, printf is slower to code.
[12:13:29] <ormaaj> I have never had a problem with echo
[12:14:56] <ormaaj> If you always use it correctly then don't bother with the wrapper function.

[12:17:35] <Earnest> In general if you're logging output it might be better to actually make functions so you don't have to repeat >&2 everywhere and they can be turned off by redefining the function to a no-op, log() { :; }
[12:17:44] <ormaaj> If you're going to define a wrapper function do it for print, which nevertheless manages to be even more verbose than echo and printf.

[13:28:04] <Soliton> grep -P is non-standard and means perl regex.

[19:51:00] <impermanence> apathor: hm, okay.  that's what I'm trying
[19:51:15] <impermanence> I'm using while $(command) which I guess is a mistake
[19:51:16] <Earnest> That is, better than running a command repeatidly and checking its output
[19:51:17] <jelly> also, grep -q or >/dev/null
[19:51:34] <yitz> Note grep -q can close pipes on you which may or may not be an issue
[19:51:38] <Earnest> There's usually much better ways to notify readiness
[19:51:45] <jelly> also, put a sleep in that loop
[19:51:47] <impermanence> yeah I need to notify readiness
[19:51:55] <Earnest> Need more detail
[19:52:22] <Soliton> do you want to call a command multiple times or one time and it coninously outputs stuff?
[19:52:27] <impermanence> I make a change and a bunch of rolling updates occur across infrastructure; statuses are constantly being updated; if any status of an update is X I can't move on
[19:52:36] <impermanence> if all statuses are not X I can move on
[19:52:37] <jelly> impermanence, what's the actual command?  There may be a better way!
[19:52:37] <yitz> while sleep 10; cmd | grep -v status; do true; done; echo DONE
[19:52:37] <impermanence> that's it
[19:52:39] <Earnest> Too much abstraction
[19:52:58] <impermanence> jelly: do you work with kubernetes tho?
[19:52:58] <yitz> Or not -v
[19:53:10] <impermanence> I guess I could check if kubectl has a readiness or wait feature
[19:53:12] <Earnest> k8s should have better mechanisms available to it
[19:53:13] <jelly> impermanence, is OpenShift kubernetes?
[19:53:14] <Earnest> Than this
[19:53:28] <impermanence> rumor has it
[19:53:30] <yitz> kubectl --watch
[19:53:39] <Earnest> I'd be very disappointed if k8s required such dull minded approaches as repeatidly grepping output lol
[19:54:03] <yitz> I think kubectl apply might have a wait flag?
[19:54:13] <Earnest> This is why details, don't abstract.  Tell us what you're actually doing, don't hide tooling behind abstractions like "command"
[19:55:18] <Earnest> yitz: kubectl has 'wait'
[19:55:33] <jelly> yitz, that while sleep 10; ... seems like very invalid syntax
[19:55:36] <yitz> kubectl apply --wait   also
[19:55:45] <Earnest> yitz: I don't see that in docs
[19:55:46] <yitz> jelly: which part?
[19:55:55] <jelly> ; not followed by do
[19:56:09] <yitz> jelly: there is a ;do  after the compound command
[19:56:21] <yitz> jelly: try it before questioning it ;)
[19:56:41] <Earnest> Oh, k8s command synopsis does not include flags
[19:56:48] <Earnest> Okay, apply has --wait
[19:56:51] <Earnest> https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#apply
[19:56:54] <yitz> Earnest: kubectl apply --help   ?

[19:57:49] <impermanence> not sure if it'll quite get me there because I have to do every deployment, but I can use wait for each deployment I guess

[21:17:25] <JohnDoe1> https://paste.debian.net/hidden/c591579d/ am I misusing or misunderstanding IFS? I was expecting it to no longer split by newlines if I define a specific character. Or is read doing the splitting by newline as well, on top of the IFS character?
[21:17:47] <greycat> read stops reading at the delimiter, which by default is newline (use -d to change that)
[21:18:31] <greycat> IFS is used to slice up what read *did* read, after it stops reading

[22:48:24] <greycat> Whatever these things are that you're talking about, do you honestly think a shell tool from the early 1980s is the best choice for implementing them?
[22:48:26] <phogg> not *this* century, obviously
[22:49:17] <greycat> The idea of using join(1) and a flat file database for *any* purpose is just ludicrous when we have real databases.  Even sqlite is orders of magnitude better in EVERY way.

[22:51:00] <greycat> HISTORY
[22:51:01] <greycat> A join utility appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.
[22:51:06] <greycat> My mistake.  1970s.
[22:53:55] <furrymcgee> interesting sql appeared a few years later

[23:05:10] <greycat> Are you on a quest to find some rational PURPOSE for ancient tools that almost nobody uses?  Is THAT the real fucking question?

[23:06:13] <phogg> SQL didn't really get going until the turn of the 80s, despite existing for years before that

[23:11:18] <jensen> do you guys prefer from top to bottom of script: var definition, function definition, arg processing, or function definition, var definition, and arg processing? any thoughts on a 'main' function?
[23:11:28] <ormaaj> Even I was surprised to learn that shell is worse than SQL. Way worse. SQL can be fragile but in the hands of the idiot you're better off. In historical context sql was a good response to procedural flat file scripting.
[23:13:31] <xmb> whats the suid bit called in chmod
[23:14:40] <ormaaj> jensen: The shell being fundamentally line-at-a-time evaluated means it's not so arbitrary. You kind of decide that on a case by case basis. It's not really like python where there are established patterns.
[23:15:51] <greycat> xmb: I call it 4000.  I cannot stand the letter-based schemes.
[23:15:59] <xmb> thanks
[23:16:49] <xmb> i did, chmod 4755 /tmp/bash, copy of /bin/bash, no go for root
[23:17:05] <xmb> does bash extra drop rights or disrespect suid, or did i wrong something
[23:17:20] <greycat> your /tmp file system might be mounted with nosuid, noexec, etc.

[23:19:52] <xmb> i wanted for an user to make a suid example, seems fail
[23:21:58] <tirnanog> that's because bash protects against this. try /bash -p.
