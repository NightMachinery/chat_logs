[22:00:08] <leah> what are the problems with it?
[22:00:25] <craigt> leah: Particularly, marking modified files as modified. GPLv2 2a, "You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change."
[22:01:14] <leah> ok?
[22:01:24] <leah> probably best to invite the author here to address these
[22:01:55] <craigt> leah: The info in the README file tells me they want to credit the original author, so the issue seems like an oversight.
